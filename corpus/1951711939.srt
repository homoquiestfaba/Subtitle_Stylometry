00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:08,505
(drumroll)

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,170
(rousing orchestral fanfare playing)

3
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,589
(fanfare ends)

4
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,830
(piano playing lullaby)

00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:06,663
##

6
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:33,523
##

7
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,860
##

8
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,631
WOMAN:
Hon, you've put it off long enough.

9
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,632
What?

10
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,201
- You know what.
- You know what.

11
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:32,802
- Negative.
- Negative.

12
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,637
Come on, negative.

13
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,713
- Come on!
- Dear Lord, please protect our Jenna

14
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:38,408
from the hell of unwanted pregnancy.

15
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:40,743
I don't need no baby.
I don't want no trouble.

16
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:42,145
I just want to make pies.

17
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,238
That's all I want to do, make pies.

18
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:46,116
I thought you weren't sleeping
with your husband no more.

19
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:47,317
He got her drunk one night.

20
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,351
I should never drink.

21
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:49,886
I do stupid things
when I drink,

22
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:50,753
like sleep with my husband.

23
00:02:50,853 --> 00:02:52,222
- Oh, no!
- (gasps)

24
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:54,057
Looks like a pink line
is forming. Shit.

25
00:02:54,157 --> 00:02:55,091
One line or two lines?

26
00:02:55,191 --> 00:02:56,392
One line or two lines?

27
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:57,927
Two lines! The control line
and the other line,

28
00:02:58,027 --> 00:03:00,230
- the bad line, the "yes" line.
- Let me see that now.

29
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,133
Two lines, two definite lines.
There's no mistaking them.

30
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:05,602
- (knocking on door)
- MAN: What's going on in there?

31
00:03:05,702 --> 00:03:07,770
We have customers!
Where are my waitresses?

32
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,573
Hold your balls straight, Cal.
Jenna ain't feeling well.

33
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:11,741
CAL:
What's wrong with her?

34
00:03:11,841 --> 00:03:13,610
It's none of your business,
you blowhard.

35
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,211
I'm fine, Cal!
We'll be right out.

36
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:18,261
CAL: Hurry up!

37
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,016
(sighs)

38
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,584
Hon, you okay?

39
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:23,520
Shh. I'm inventing a new pie

40
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,888
in my head.

41
00:03:24,988 --> 00:03:27,938
Tomorrow's blue plate special.

42
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,741
I'm calling it
"I Don't Want

43
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,430
Earl's Baby Pie."

44
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,100
I don't think we can write that
on the menu board, hon.

45
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,635
Then I'll just call it
"Bad Baby Pie."

46
00:03:38,735 --> 00:03:40,727
What's in it, honey?

47
00:03:40,827 --> 00:03:46,004
It's a quiche of egg and Brie cheese
with a smoked ham center.

48
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,778
Sounds good, baby.

49
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:51,998
I ain't never going to get
away from Earl now.

50
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:55,098
(hard rock playing)

51
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,456
You going to tell him?

52
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:02,392
I'm not sure.

53
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,228
If my plan comes true and I
can make my big escape from him

54
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,764
in a couple months,
maybe he never even has to know.

55
00:04:07,864 --> 00:04:09,566
Are you sure it's his child?

56
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,534
You know everything I do.
I ain't never cheated.

57
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:12,569
- Ah...
- I'd never do that.

58
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,103
- Eh...
- I feel sorry for you, Jenna.

59
00:04:14,203 --> 00:04:15,805
I mean, I'd do anything

60
00:04:15,905 --> 00:04:18,241
to meet a man, and Becky's
husband is a senile fruitcake.

61
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,177
- Dawn!
- Well, I'm sorry, it's true.

62
00:04:21,277 --> 00:04:22,612
But now here you are,

63
00:04:22,712 --> 00:04:24,781
married to this handsome guy.

64
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:25,782
Who's got very good hair.

65
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:27,217
Who's got very good hair.

66
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:28,284
And pregnant with

67
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:29,752
a little girl.

68
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:30,853
How do you know it's a girl?

69
00:04:30,953 --> 00:04:32,946
- We don't know it's a girl.
- But neither of us

70
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:35,023
would trade places with you for
one second.

71
00:04:35,123 --> 00:04:36,859
Now would we, Becky?

72
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,228
No, we wouldn't, Dawn.
No, we wouldn't.

73
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:40,320
Except, just once in my life,

74
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,565
I'd like to be able to make

75
00:04:42,665 --> 00:04:43,633
a pie half as good

76
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:45,301
as Jenna can make a pie.

77
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:46,936
- Yeah, me, too.
-JENNA: Oh, come on.

78
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,805
So what if I can make a decent pie?

79
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:50,640
- Who cares?
- Look at this, Jenna.

80
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,027
As you can plainly see,
my right boob is much higher

81
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,245
than my left boob

82
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:56,412
and Dawn here has

83
00:04:56,512 --> 00:04:58,648
pasty, pasty skin.

84
00:04:58,748 --> 00:05:01,451
I'm stuck in a marriage
to Droolin, Phil the Invalid,

85
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,852
and Dawn eats TV dinners alone,

86
00:05:02,952 --> 00:05:04,487
but still, we wouldn't
rather be you.

87
00:05:04,587 --> 00:05:07,537
I do have pasty, pasty skin.

88
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,141
(car horn blaring)

89
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,298
Yeah, I know, you're here.

90
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,100
See you tomorrow, honey.

91
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,134
Good luck.

92
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,535
- And if you do tell him you're...
- Shh!

93
00:05:19,635 --> 00:05:20,370
Hey.

94
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,904
Hey.

95
00:05:22,004 --> 00:05:24,954
(heavy metal playing)

96
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,277
BECKY: Hiya there, Earl.

97
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:29,545
We all just agreed that your hair
is super attractive.

98
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:30,713
Hooray for you.

99
00:05:30,813 --> 00:05:33,763
- Woo-hoo!
- Woo-hoo!

100
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:39,262
I don't care if she is a pie genius.

101
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,427
I wouldn't trade places with her.

102
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:44,327
No, me neither.

103
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,377
(hard rock playing)

104
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,714
You don't look happy to see me.

105
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,502
Are you happy to see me?

106
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,936
Yeah, I'm happy to see you.

107
00:05:54,036 --> 00:05:55,171
Even brought you a piece

108
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,540
of today's special,
"Kick In The Pants Pie."

109
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,641
Cinnamon spice custard.

110
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:01,691
You don't give me a kiss.

111
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,896
Well, give me one.

112
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,319
There. That's more like it.

113
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:10,953
Where's that money

114
00:06:11,053 --> 00:06:12,188
you made today?

115
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,356
Right here in my pocket.

116
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,406
Well, now, hand it over.

117
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,362
Not much here, is there?

118
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,197
Slow day, you know.

119
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,273
Yeah, you been having
more and more of those.

120
00:06:23,373 --> 00:06:26,169
I'm really not sure it's worth
you working there anymore.

121
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:28,271
I think I might rather have you
be at home

122
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:29,806
making me pies all day long.

123
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:31,040
(chuckling)

124
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,608
You didn't ask me

125
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,010
how my day was.

126
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,011
How was your day?

127
00:06:35,111 --> 00:06:36,045
Ask me like you

128
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,847
care about it.

129
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:40,516
How was your day, Earl?

130
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:44,186
Well, you know,
Johnson's on my case again,

131
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,657
about the mortgages and everything.

132
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:50,659
But I don't make the bank policy,
and I told him that,

133
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,496
- but he doesn't listen.
- (hard rock fades)

134
00:06:53,596 --> 00:06:56,232
- (dreamy lullaby plays)
-JENNA: "I Hate My Husband Pie"

135
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,768
You take bitter sweet chocolate
and don't sweeten it.

136
00:06:58,868 --> 00:07:00,403
You make it in to a pudding

137
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,205
and drown it in caramel.

138
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:03,806
- (hard rock resumes)
- You're not listening to me.

139
00:07:03,906 --> 00:07:04,874
Yeah, I am.

140
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:06,075
What I say?

141
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,244
You were bitching about Mr. Johnson.

142
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,580
What were the exact words I said?

143
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,248
Well, I mean, I can't repeat
them verbatim...

144
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:15,250
You don't listen to me!

145
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,301
Hurts my feelings.

146
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,789
Please just say you're sorry

147
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:22,658
so I can let you out this car
so you can make my dinner.

148
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:24,734
I'm sorry, Earl,
for not being able

149
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:25,762
to repeat your words verbatim,

150
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,263
something I should be able to do.

151
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,165
Whenever I need it.

152
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:32,215
Whenever you need it.

153
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,652
All right, then.

154
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,326
You look handsome tonight, Early.

155
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,915
Thank you, honey.

156
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:47,650
(chuckles)

157
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,520
It's been a long time since
you called me Early.

158
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,922
I like it.

159
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:55,591
And you look pretty tonight.

160
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:57,675
Maybe a little tired is all.

161
00:07:57,775 --> 00:08:01,584
You're not eating
your spaghetti pie. Why not?

162
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:05,718
I'm thinking I want to borrow
some money from you.

163
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,787
And my answer to that,
of course, is no.

164
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:11,891
There's a big pie Bake-Off in
Jonesville in a couple months.

165
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,075
And I'd like to go.

166
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:15,812
And my answer to that,
of course, is no.

167
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,647
Prize money is pretty good.

168
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,100
- (fork clatters)
- Why do you need money?

169
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,319
I give you everything
you need, don't I?

170
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,887
Absolutely.

171
00:08:24,987 --> 00:08:27,490
You want for nothing, don't you?

172
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,826
Yes, Earl, I want for nothing.

173
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,876
I mean, your pies ain't bad.

174
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,998
But what's so important about that
when you got me to take care of?

175
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,501
That's a good point, Earl.

176
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,577
(chuckles)

177
00:08:40,677 --> 00:08:43,553
(snoring)

178
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,657
(crickets chirping)

179
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,366
(door creaks)

180
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:12,148
(woman singing aria in Italian)

181
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,712
(door creaks open)

182
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,762
WOMAN:Jenna Hunterson.

183
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,926
(knocking at door)

184
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:35,391
MAN: Hello, Mrs. Bunterson.

185
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,467
Hunterson.

186
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:38,794
Who are you?

187
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:39,862
I'm your doctor.

188
00:09:39,962 --> 00:09:41,631
Oh, wow, you brought me a pie.

189
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:43,566
How nice.
You know what?

190
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,619
I've only been here a few weeks,
but already I am genuinely

191
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,404
impressed with the hospitality of this place.

192
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,506
You're not my doctor.

193
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:51,574
Lily Mueller is my doctor.

194
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,808
This pie is for her.

195
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:54,343
It's Marshmallow Mermaid,
her favorite.

196
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:55,745
Well, she's semiretired now.

197
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,380
Just sort of happened this morning.
She kind of quit.

198
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,148
We didn't have time to call anybody.

199
00:09:59,248 --> 00:10:01,232
But Dr. Mueller delivered me.

200
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:02,685
I mean, she's been my doctor forever.

201
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:04,220
I really liked and trusted her.

202
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,089
Maybe you could really like
and trust me, too?

203
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,182
I've never even seen you before.

204
00:10:09,282 --> 00:10:10,760
Yeah, I just got hired.

205
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,229
Long story, making it short,
this is still

206
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:16,247
Dr. Mueller's practice,
I'm the junior doctor on staff.

207
00:10:16,347 --> 00:10:18,327
Um, Just moved here from
Connecticut two weeks ago.

208
00:10:18,427 --> 00:10:20,102
Dr. Mueller had a class
over the summer

209
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,104
and I was a student of hers,
and is this story boring you?

210
00:10:23,204 --> 00:10:24,407
No... yes.

211
00:10:24,507 --> 00:10:25,508
Sorry, anyway,

212
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:27,009
it's nice to meet you.

213
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:28,611
What's your name again?

214
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,679
I'm Dr. Jim Pomatter.

215
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:30,746
Okay.

216
00:10:30,846 --> 00:10:32,448
- And you are?
-Jenna Hunterson

217
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,183
Jenna Hunterson
It is nice to meet you.

218
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:35,785
So... What seems to be the problem?

219
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,987
Well, I seem to be pregnant.

220
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:39,021
Good.

221
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:40,256
Good for you.
Congratulations.

222
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:41,724
Thanks, but I don't want this baby.

223
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:44,327
Oh, well, we don't perform... uh...

224
00:10:44,427 --> 00:10:45,528
No, I'm keeping it,

225
00:10:45,628 --> 00:10:47,621
I'm just telling you I'm
not so happy about it,

226
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:48,931
like everybody else might be.

227
00:10:49,031 --> 00:10:51,267
So maybe you can be sensitive
and not congratulate me

228
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,343
and make a big deal
every time you see me.

229
00:10:53,443 --> 00:10:55,104
I'm having the baby,
and that's that.

230
00:10:55,204 --> 00:10:56,439
It's not a party, though.

231
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:59,241
Got it, okay, not a party.

232
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:01,544
Uh, well, then, why don't we, um...

233
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:03,312
we'll have to do a blood test,

234
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,914
make sure you're pregnant
and then we'll check

235
00:11:05,014 --> 00:11:06,382
for diseases, hormone levels,
stuff like that?

236
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:07,583
Sounds like a plan.

237
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:10,618
Okay, well, the nurse
will be right in.

238
00:11:10,718 --> 00:11:13,703
Um... don't go anywhere.

239
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:15,992
(door closes)

240
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,828
Nowhere to go.

241
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:19,829
(knocking at door)

242
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,297
Come in.

243
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:24,347
Hi, Jenna, have a seat.

244
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:28,054
Okay, I'm going to give
you this pie now, Dr. Pomatter.

245
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,039
Oh, thank you.

246
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:32,408
Thank you very much.
Look at that.

247
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:34,877
You know what?Just push-push
all of those off on to the floor.

248
00:11:34,977 --> 00:11:36,512
Go ahead, push them off.
That's fine. Just...

249
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,562
I'll get to those later.

250
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,858
(sighs)

251
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,545
Well, un-congratulations-
you're definitely having a baby.

252
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,363
Un-thank you.

253
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,166
So for the next eight months,
if you need me, I'm here.

254
00:11:57,266 --> 00:11:59,135
If you have any questions,
just give a call.

255
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:00,503
We'll be doing some tests.

256
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:02,605
All of which I'll tell you
about before they happen.

257
00:12:02,705 --> 00:12:03,873
And I'm going to give you

258
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,458
a prescription for,
uh, prenatal vitamins.

259
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,513
And do you have any,
uh, questions for me?

260
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:12,882
What kind of questions?

261
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,617
I don't know.
Concerns about your pregnancy?

262
00:12:14,717 --> 00:12:16,693
Do's and don'ts?

263
00:12:16,793 --> 00:12:18,254
Anything you're wondering about?

264
00:12:18,354 --> 00:12:19,822
Exercise, sex...

265
00:12:19,922 --> 00:12:20,890
I don't really do much

266
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,358
of either of those things, so...

267
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,376
Okay, any diet concerns?

268
00:12:25,476 --> 00:12:27,897
Not really. I mean,
just eat healthy, right?

269
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,533
Eat healthy, um, avoid certain
cheeses, certain fish...

270
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:33,551
The receptionist, she can
give you a list of good and bad

271
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:35,738
foods for your pregnancy,
general do's and don'ts.

272
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:36,906
Okay.

273
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,998
And here is your prescription.

274
00:12:39,098 --> 00:12:42,024
I'll just... sorry.

275
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:46,365
And, uh, it was very nice
to meet you, Jenna.

276
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,017
And I'll want to see you again

277
00:12:48,117 --> 00:12:49,485
- in about three weeks.
- Okay.

278
00:12:49,585 --> 00:12:52,535
- Okay.
- (banging thud)

279
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,959
I do have one question.

280
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:58,127
Shoot.

281
00:12:58,227 --> 00:13:00,476
How pregnant am I, exactly?

282
00:13:00,576 --> 00:13:01,897
Very pregnant.

283
00:13:01,997 --> 00:13:04,366
There's really only one degree
of pregnancy, so to speak.

284
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:06,602
No, I mean, uh, how far along am I?

285
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,938
Uh, about six weeks,

286
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,406
give or take.

287
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:15,436
Yeah, that was Earl getting me
drunk that night, all right.

288
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,029
(country music plays)

289
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,885
CAL:
You're late.

290
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:24,978
By six minutes. I'm sorry.
The bus was late.

291
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:27,423
Why doesn't your damn husband
buy you a car already?

292
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:29,992
'cause he don't want
me goin, nowhere.

293
00:13:30,092 --> 00:13:32,628
And you, late again.

294
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,948
You are inches away
from being fired, missy.

295
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,300
Oh, Just try firing me,
you old bucket of cheese.

296
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,503
Who you calling a bucket
of cheese, you heifer?

297
00:13:40,603 --> 00:13:42,595
Now get to work before
I fire your ass.

298
00:13:42,695 --> 00:13:45,621
Calm down, you psychotic ape.

299
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,676
(door opening)

300
00:13:47,776 --> 00:13:51,091
Hey, what are you doing?
Close the door!

301
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,217
How's the doc?

302
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:56,418
Fine, it was fine.

303
00:13:56,518 --> 00:13:58,721
New doctor, a man.

304
00:13:58,821 --> 00:14:00,389
A man, wow.

305
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:02,792
Is he single?
Maybe he's good for Dawn.

306
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:04,693
No, I think he was wearing a ring.

307
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:06,295
Weird guy, nervous.

308
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:07,496
From Connecticut.

309
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,832
Hey, honey, could you do me a favor?

310
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:10,900
What?

311
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,501
Old Joe just came in
and sat in my station.

312
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,804
Could you take him?
I can't deal with him today.

313
00:14:14,904 --> 00:14:16,888
You're better with him than I am.

314
00:14:16,988 --> 00:14:18,240
Yeah, sure, I'll take him.

315
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,290
Thanks, hon, you're a trooper.

316
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,745
Oh.

317
00:14:22,845 --> 00:14:25,014
What? What's wrong?

318
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,750
You okay? You going to be sick?

319
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,885
I'm okay.
(moans gently)

320
00:14:29,985 --> 00:14:31,787
Just nauseous for a second.

321
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:33,155
(knocking at door)

322
00:14:33,255 --> 00:14:36,205
CAL:
Hurry up, let's get to work!

323
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,895
(country music plays)

324
00:14:39,995 --> 00:14:42,945
(patrons conversing indistinctly)

325
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,036
Hi, Joe.

326
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,637
How you doing today, my friend?

327
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:51,473
What can I get you?

328
00:14:51,573 --> 00:14:53,175
This is my pie diner.

329
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:54,476
I own it.

330
00:14:54,576 --> 00:14:56,011
I know you do, Joe.

331
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:58,214
And I think it's warm in here.
I know I'm warm.

332
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,549
I'll tell Cal, hon.

333
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,118
They keep all my businesses
too warm on the inside.

334
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:07,106
My gas station, my supermarket,
my Laundromat...

335
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,558
But this is my favorite business.

336
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,393
Joe's Pie Shop.

337
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,828
I'm Joe.

338
00:15:12,928 --> 00:15:15,030
And I will not tolerate it being

339
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,565
too damn warm in here.

340
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,800
I hear you, Joe.

341
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,068
Turn the air on.

342
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,803
Yes, sirree, bub.

343
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:22,271
Okay.

344
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:24,673
I want two glasses of water, no ice.

345
00:15:24,773 --> 00:15:26,508
Two glasses, no problem.

346
00:15:26,608 --> 00:15:27,843
- Two glasses.
- Right.

347
00:15:27,943 --> 00:15:29,778
No ice.

348
00:15:29,878 --> 00:15:33,432
And I want the "Bad Baby Quiche Pie"
with tomato on the side,

349
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:34,884
on its own plate.

350
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:36,085
No potatoes with that?

351
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,721
Did I say anything about potatoes?

352
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:40,022
Where'd you get potatoes from?

353
00:15:40,122 --> 00:15:41,757
No potatoes, tomato.

354
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,125
On its own plate.

355
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:44,260
Salt and pepper.

356
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,327
That everything?

357
00:15:45,427 --> 00:15:46,629
No.

358
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:47,796
I want orange juice.

359
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:48,964
But don't bring that first.

360
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:50,032
Bring the water first.

361
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:53,192
Bring the orange juice
with the meal.

362
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:56,889
Okay, listen to my horoscope
before you skedaddle away.

363
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,742
"Aquarius...

364
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:04,063
Smooth sailing today as Mars
enters your inner circle."

365
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,448
Whatever the hell that means.

366
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:10,636
"The ones you love will listen
carefully to you today,

367
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:14,173
just make sure you're careful
with what you say."

368
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,926
Hmm.
I don't have ones I love.

369
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:18,127
Want to hear yours?

370
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,261
Uh, I'm Aquarius, too, hon.

371
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:20,763
I don't have ones I love either.

372
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:21,830
Just ones I live with.

373
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:22,898
Excuse me, I feel like

374
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:25,948
I'm going to be sick.

375
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,570
(toilet flushes)

376
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,620
(sighs)

377
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,757
(tap running)

378
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,548
You okay, sweetie?

379
00:16:39,648 --> 00:16:40,916
Yeah, I'm okay.

380
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:44,803
Good. Listen, um, I have
a five-minute blind date tonight

381
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,891
with an insurance
salesman named Pete.

382
00:16:46,991 --> 00:16:49,291
Five foot 10, 37,
all his hair, nice picture,

383
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:50,993
- loves fishing.
- Five-minute date?

384
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,895
Can't the guy pay for
the whole thing?

385
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:55,945
Yeah, see, um, I have this idea.

386
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,078
I'm meeting men through
personal ads,

387
00:16:58,178 --> 00:16:59,802
but I just give them five minutes.

388
00:16:59,902 --> 00:17:01,303
Whether or not we
like each other,

389
00:17:01,403 --> 00:17:03,172
- we just have five minutes together.
- Huh.

390
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,507
That way, you know,
if the guy makes me sick,

391
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,676
I don't waste a whole evening.
Anyway, I'm supposed

392
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,278
to meet this guy at
7:00 at Banshee's.

393
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:11,780
I was wondering if you would
do a full makeup for me

394
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,382
here in the bathroom,
before I leave?

395
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:15,117
A full makeup for five minutes?

396
00:17:15,217 --> 00:17:18,203
Well, yeah, it's very important
to make a good first impression.

397
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,522
I mean, wh-what if he's
Prince Charming?

398
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,791
There is no such thing.

399
00:17:22,891 --> 00:17:23,993
Whatever.

400
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:25,494
Will you do that for me?

401
00:17:25,594 --> 00:17:26,662
Yeah, of course.

402
00:17:26,762 --> 00:17:28,330
Oh, would you also make me

403
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,299
your "Falling In Love
Chocolate Mousse Pie"?

404
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:31,667
That is my favorite pie.

405
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:33,936
What the heck, I'll do
it during my break, okay?

406
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:34,970
You are the queen

407
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,305
of kindness and goodness.

408
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:39,355
(bluesy music playing)

409
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,045
(patrons conversing indistinctly)

410
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,138
You with child?

411
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:47,198
Shh, quiet.

412
00:17:47,298 --> 00:17:50,052
I've seen that look on
a woman's face before.

413
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,754
Name was Annette.

414
00:17:51,854 --> 00:17:53,956
I made sweet love to her
all through the summer

415
00:17:54,056 --> 00:17:55,324
of 1948.

416
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:56,725
She got that sick look

417
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:00,312
on her face like you had
all through the fall.

418
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,297
I almost married her right up.

419
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:03,799
She lost the baby, though.

420
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:04,967
Close call.

421
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:06,168
When you due?

422
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:07,669
Shh, Joe...

423
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:10,172
Don't want Cal to hear.
You can't lose my job.

424
00:18:10,272 --> 00:18:12,508
I'm trying to save money
so I can leave my husband.

425
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:14,592
Why, what's wrong with him?

426
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:16,278
Hey, there's no salt and pepper

427
00:18:16,378 --> 00:18:18,680
on the table. I asked
for salt and pepper

428
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,214
and no ice in my juice glass.

429
00:18:21,314 --> 00:18:23,276
- Can't you get nothing I say right?
- I'll go get

430
00:18:23,376 --> 00:18:24,787
your salt and pepper and juice
with no ice.

431
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:26,021
But you got to promise me

432
00:18:26,121 --> 00:18:27,589
you'll keep your mouth shut
about this baby.

433
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,924
What baby?

434
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:31,760
Good man.

435
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,695
BECKY:
Honey, Earl's on the phone.

436
00:18:33,795 --> 00:18:35,771
- Tell him I'm busy.
- You don't talk to him,

437
00:18:35,871 --> 00:18:38,000
he might come over here
and cause a scene again.

438
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,034
Yeah, okay.

439
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:40,235
Can I ask you a question?

440
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:41,503
Is it my imagination,

441
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:43,639
or is my left one drooping
down even more today?

442
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:45,874
I'm starting to feel like something Picasso
would have made.

443
00:18:45,974 --> 00:18:47,967
Do me a favor, hon,
get Old Joe some O.J.-

444
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:49,611
no ice- or he'll bite your head off.

445
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,646
- And some salt and pepper.
- You got it.

446
00:18:52,746 --> 00:18:54,516
Hello, Earl.

447
00:18:54,616 --> 00:18:56,151
Good, good.

448
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:58,887
No, I-I am glad you called.

449
00:18:58,987 --> 00:19:01,937
You picking me up tonight?

450
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:06,272
No, that's fine, I'll ask
Becky to give me a ride.

451
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:10,165
Yes, I know you work hard.

452
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:12,768
Earl, I've got to get back.

453
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:14,002
We're busy here today.

454
00:19:14,102 --> 00:19:15,003
Okay.

455
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:16,672
Bye.

456
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:19,722
I love you, too.

457
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,534
##

458
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,617
##

459
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:58,227
Mm.

460
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,631
"Falling In Love Pie."

461
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,787
BECKY:
Oh, pretty outfit, Dawn.

462
00:20:05,887 --> 00:20:07,122
Thank you.

463
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:09,258
It's a little tight
in the butt, I fear.

464
00:20:09,358 --> 00:20:11,793
Oh, no worries. Men like a little meat
back there, don't they, Jenna?

465
00:20:11,893 --> 00:20:13,228
I have no idea what men like.

466
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:14,663
Speaking of more meat,

467
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:17,749
does Earl have any clue at all
that you're pregnant?

468
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,335
No, he don't notice, and
I'm never going to tell him.

469
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:21,670
I'm just going to run away.

470
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:22,671
Wow.

471
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:24,206
How much money you got saved?

472
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,941
Not much, $1,200

473
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,442
and I can save
another couple hundred

474
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:28,911
before the Jonesville Bake-Off.

475
00:20:29,011 --> 00:20:30,579
How much is that prize money?

476
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:32,748
$25,000, hon.

477
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:34,616
Wow. What pie you going to bake?

478
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:36,018
I'm not sure.

479
00:20:36,118 --> 00:20:38,520
I was thinking I'd make one
of my real unusual ones,

480
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,888
like my mama used to make.

481
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,323
One where you wouldn't think
the ingredients

482
00:20:41,423 --> 00:20:42,824
would all go together, but they do.

483
00:20:42,924 --> 00:20:43,825
Huh.

484
00:20:43,925 --> 00:20:46,094
Dawn, you're beautiful.

485
00:20:46,194 --> 00:20:48,297
Your skin looks like
a normal person's.

486
00:20:48,397 --> 00:20:50,732
Thank you.

487
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,034
I know what you should do

488
00:20:52,134 --> 00:20:53,869
with that prize money, Jenna.

489
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:56,004
You should open your own pie shop.

490
00:20:56,104 --> 00:20:58,097
Oh, yeah.

491
00:20:58,197 --> 00:21:00,409
You should have your own little
pie shop somewhere.

492
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,678
Somewhere where they could
really use a little pie shop,

493
00:21:02,778 --> 00:21:04,754
like Europe or New Jersey.

494
00:21:04,854 --> 00:21:07,549
Wow, my own pie shop.

495
00:21:07,649 --> 00:21:09,918
Jenna's Pie Palace.

496
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,887
Jenna's Pastry Heaven.

497
00:21:11,987 --> 00:21:13,589
Okay, back to reality for a minute.

498
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,557
Hey, can you give me
a ride home, Becky?

499
00:21:15,657 --> 00:21:17,259
Earl don't want
to pick me up tonight.

500
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,660
No, take the bus.

501
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,862
I can't drive you.
I've got somewhere to go.

502
00:21:20,962 --> 00:21:22,097
Oh, where you going?

503
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,832
I can't tell you that.

504
00:21:23,932 --> 00:21:24,833
- What?
- What?

505
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:26,568
Yet! I can't tell you

506
00:21:26,668 --> 00:21:27,903
that yet.

507
00:21:28,003 --> 00:21:29,004
Why not?

508
00:21:29,104 --> 00:21:30,706
Got to go!

509
00:21:30,806 --> 00:21:32,674
You have fun on
your five-minute date.

510
00:21:32,774 --> 00:21:34,009
Use a five-minute condom.

511
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:35,077
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Bye.

512
00:21:35,177 --> 00:21:36,178
Hey!

513
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:37,713
(wry chuckle)

514
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:38,780
(door closes)

515
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,815
(sighs)

516
00:21:39,915 --> 00:21:43,123
Well, whatever it is,
I hope it's good.

517
00:21:43,223 --> 00:21:44,720
Go look at yourself, hon.

518
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,989
This guy's not going
to know what hit him.

519
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:48,023
(giggles)

520
00:21:48,123 --> 00:21:51,073
Go on.

521
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,396
Oh!

522
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:56,565
Look what you did.

523
00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:58,649
You made me almost pretty.

524
00:21:58,749 --> 00:22:00,836
What do you mean "almost pretty"?

525
00:22:00,936 --> 00:22:02,404
You're lovely.

526
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:05,173
Look at yourself.

527
00:22:05,273 --> 00:22:07,109
Oh...

528
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:08,744
- Hey, sweetie?
- Hmm?

529
00:22:08,844 --> 00:22:11,346
You think you can drop me off at the bus stop
on your way to Banshee's?

530
00:22:11,446 --> 00:22:14,396
Yeah.

531
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:18,634
(dreamy lullaby plays)

532
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,358
"Baby Screaming It's Head Off

533
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:26,161
in the Middle of the Night
and Ruining My Life Pie"

534
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:29,615
New York-style cheesecake,
brandy brushed,

535
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:32,715
with pecans and nutmeg.

536
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,508
Hello.

537
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,584
Jenna?

538
00:22:41,684 --> 00:22:42,511
What?

539
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,179
Hi. Dr. Pomatter.

540
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,247
Yeah.

541
00:22:45,347 --> 00:22:47,149
What are you doing here?

542
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:48,984
Oh, my car wouldn't
start this morning-

543
00:22:49,084 --> 00:22:50,118
God knows why.

544
00:22:50,218 --> 00:22:51,420
Got to take the bus home.

545
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,821
Where do you live?

546
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:54,189
Uh, Stanton Grove.

547
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,424
Oh, it's nice over there.

548
00:22:55,524 --> 00:22:58,442
Yeah, yeah, it's nice.

549
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:03,472
If you like trees, which, you know,
who doesn't like trees?

550
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,101
It's a long walk.

551
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:07,769
Do you mind if I sit down?

552
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:10,138
Not at all.

553
00:23:10,238 --> 00:23:13,188
Thanks.

554
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:17,145
So you're a waitress.

555
00:23:17,245 --> 00:23:18,213
I'm a waitress.

556
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,614
Where do you work?

557
00:23:19,714 --> 00:23:22,578
Uh, a little diner off Highway 27.

558
00:23:22,678 --> 00:23:24,186
Joe's Pie Diner.

559
00:23:24,286 --> 00:23:25,987
Oh, wow.

560
00:23:26,087 --> 00:23:29,317
Sounds like a veritable
factory of pie.

561
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:30,692
(chuckles)

562
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:32,961
I've never been there.
Is it... is it... is it good?

563
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:34,830
Yes, it's very good.

564
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,199
We make all the pies there fresh.

565
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:41,687
Breakfast pies, dinner pies,
27 different varieties of pie.

566
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,072
And a new one that
I create every day.

567
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:47,192
I was just inventing a new one
in my head when you walked up.

568
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:50,529
Did you make that marshmallow pie
that you brought me?

569
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,248
Yes, I did.
"Marshmallow Mermaid Pie."

570
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,217
I invented it when I
was nine years old,

571
00:23:55,317 --> 00:23:56,718
in my mermaid phase.

572
00:23:56,818 --> 00:23:59,421
That was probably the best pie
I've ever tasted in my life.

573
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,223
That pie, it was...

574
00:24:01,323 --> 00:24:04,343
that pie was biblically good,
that's how good it was.

575
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,762
That pie could win pie contests

576
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,130
and ribbons and things.
It was...

577
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,297
Thank you.

578
00:24:09,397 --> 00:24:12,299
Yeah.

579
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:15,103
You know, there was a pie diner
right near where I grew up.

580
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,205
And I used to go there every day
after school.

581
00:24:17,305 --> 00:24:20,859
I had a mad crush on this
waitress named Beatrice.

582
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,010
She looked tragically cute

583
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,479
in her uniform,

584
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:28,667
and years later, I was doing my
residency and she came in

585
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,318
with an emergency ovarian cyst.

586
00:24:30,418 --> 00:24:32,053
I actually treated her.

587
00:24:32,153 --> 00:24:33,855
Wow.

588
00:24:33,955 --> 00:24:35,524
That must have been
something for you.

589
00:24:35,624 --> 00:24:39,279
Well, she was at least
50 years old by then.

590
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:45,100
Life does funny kind
of things sometimes.

591
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,735
Yes, it does.

592
00:24:46,835 --> 00:24:49,785
Yes, it does.

593
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:52,908
You want to hear something
else kind of funny?

594
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:55,000
When I saw you sitting here
alone in your uniform,

595
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,812
I... I had a flashback.

596
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,313
You made me think of her.

597
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,982
You kind of remind me of her

598
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:01,983
when she was younger.

599
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,033
Wow. What a thing to say.

600
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:06,922
Yeah, sorry, it was a compliment.

601
00:25:07,022 --> 00:25:08,557
No, I know.

602
00:25:08,657 --> 00:25:11,193
That's why it made me uncomfortable.

603
00:25:11,293 --> 00:25:12,861
You're blushing.

604
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:14,229
Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

605
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:16,598
No, it was a nice thing to hear. I...

606
00:25:16,698 --> 00:25:19,000
Nobody ever notices me in that way.

607
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,076
Well, somebody
noticed you that way-

608
00:25:21,176 --> 00:25:23,102
otherwise you wouldn't be in
the condition you're in.

609
00:25:23,202 --> 00:25:24,739
- Oh, him?
- Yeah.

610
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:27,709
He don't count.
He's just my husband.

611
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:30,445
I'm kidding. Of course he counts.
He's my husband.

612
00:25:30,545 --> 00:25:31,913
(chuckles)
Oh!

613
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:33,482
Oh, here's the bus.

614
00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:35,350
Call me whenever you need me, Jenna.

615
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,703
I'm here for all your
questions and concerns.

616
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,255
(rock music plays)

617
00:25:40,355 --> 00:25:42,691
Please?

618
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,360
Please?

619
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,410
Please?

620
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:52,447
Please?

621
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,984
Come on, honey.

622
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,276
I-I feel sick in my stomach.

623
00:26:01,376 --> 00:26:04,326
You know, it's been over a month.

624
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,123
I feel about as sexy
as a tree stump.

625
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,402
You ain't never been sexier.

626
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:19,678
Am I imagining it, or are
your boobies getting bigger?

627
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,098
Like they grew a size
practically overnight.

628
00:26:23,198 --> 00:26:26,148
That's crazy, Earl.

629
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:30,452
I got to be with you
or I'm going to die.

630
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,259
Come on, baby, kiss me back.

631
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,699
Move up, baby.
Come on, honey.

632
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,156
Say something sexy to me.

633
00:26:48,256 --> 00:26:49,991
What do you want me to say?

634
00:26:50,091 --> 00:26:53,041
(groaning)

635
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,946
(sighing)

636
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:05,854
(sighs)

637
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:09,992
That was...
That was great.

638
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,814
That was great, baby.
Mmm...

639
00:27:12,914 --> 00:27:13,915
Wasn't it?

640
00:27:14,015 --> 00:27:16,965
Yes, absolutely wonderful.

641
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,470
(yawning)

642
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,807
(country-pop playing)

643
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:29,911
## (man singing)

644
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:45,627
## (continues)

645
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,570
Oh, no, no, no, no.

646
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,705
No, no, no.
I don't want you as my waitress.

647
00:28:10,805 --> 00:28:12,440
I want her, Dawn.

648
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,942
That lady right there.

649
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:15,010
(mouthing)

650
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,411
Oh, well, I'm sorry, honey,

651
00:28:16,511 --> 00:28:17,846
but you're sitting in my station.

652
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,514
All the tables in Dawn's
station are taken.

653
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:22,250
No, but I don't want you.
I want her.

654
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,653
Well, if you want to eat
in this diner,

655
00:28:24,753 --> 00:28:28,006
-you got to sit here, and I've got to wait on you.
- She a good friend of yours?

656
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:30,094
What can you tell me about her?
What's she...

657
00:28:30,194 --> 00:28:33,396
- What are her likes and dislikes?
What does she look for in a man?

658
00:28:33,496 --> 00:28:33,979
Uh, honey,

659
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,731
I'm just here to bring you pie
or coffee or something like that.

660
00:28:36,831 --> 00:28:38,299
I don't dispense romantic advice.

661
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:39,601
What if I paid you?

662
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:41,036
Excuse me, I'm going to go

663
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,805
talk to Dawn for a minute,
see if she won't

664
00:28:43,905 --> 00:28:48,580
- come deal with you herself.
- Oh, that'd be wonderful.

665
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:54,329
## (ends)

666
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,017
(groaning)

667
00:28:56,117 --> 00:28:58,520
- You've got to help me.
- What is going on?

668
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,954
That guy, his name is Ogie,

669
00:29:00,054 --> 00:29:01,389
short for Oklahoma.

670
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,482
I was supposed to meet someone
named Pete last night.

671
00:29:03,582 --> 00:29:04,659
Instead, he sent Ogie.

672
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:06,735
It was the worst five minutes in my life.

673
00:29:06,835 --> 00:29:08,863
I made the mistake of
telling him I work here.

674
00:29:08,963 --> 00:29:11,399
JENNA:
How could a five-minute date be that bad?

675
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,801
He took me through the entire medical

676
00:29:12,901 --> 00:29:14,102
and psychiatric history of his family.

677
00:29:14,202 --> 00:29:15,203
Oh, no.

678
00:29:15,303 --> 00:29:17,005
And he told me he wants to marry me.

679
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:18,807
- Oh, no!
- Marry me!

680
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:21,476
And he's not giving up, not ever giving up,
that's what he said.

681
00:29:21,576 --> 00:29:23,569
First guy that pays any
attention to me in years,

682
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:25,645
and he turns out to be
the mad stalking elf.

683
00:29:25,745 --> 00:29:27,697
I'm telling you, Jenna,
your makeup job was too good,

684
00:29:27,797 --> 00:29:28,683
and your "Magic Love Pie..."?

685
00:29:28,783 --> 00:29:29,851
I'm sorry.

686
00:29:29,951 --> 00:29:32,253
- What am I supposed to do?
- You go over there

687
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,822
and you tell him you're not interested.

688
00:29:33,922 --> 00:29:35,657
- I told him that last night.
- Tell him better.

689
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:39,959
- Come with me.
- I can't. I've got to go throw up.

690
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:43,071
Fine, I'll just
go over there myself.

691
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,235
I'm a very persistent man, Dawn.

692
00:29:47,335 --> 00:29:49,537
I know what I want.
I know what makes me happy.

693
00:29:49,637 --> 00:29:50,605
Blah, blah, blah.

694
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,874
I'm a tax auditor.

695
00:29:52,974 --> 00:29:55,949
I make $31,000 a year plus bonuses.

696
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,249
I drive a very nice compact car.

697
00:29:58,349 --> 00:30:00,749
I eat at all the best restaurants

698
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:02,450
within a 50-mile radius.

699
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,551
I love my mother.

700
00:30:03,651 --> 00:30:05,286
What else do you need
to know about me?

701
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,756
- How to make you go away.
- You can't.

702
00:30:07,856 --> 00:30:09,524
You can't make me go away.

703
00:30:09,624 --> 00:30:11,192
'Cause I don't take
no for an answer.

704
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:13,895
I'll just keep coming back
and coming back

705
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:15,830
till finally your resistance is weakened.

706
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,632
'cause we were meant
to be together, Dawn.

707
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:18,833
You don't know me!

708
00:30:18,933 --> 00:30:19,968
Oh, yes, I do.

709
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,170
You're Dawn.

710
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:25,220
And you inspire poetry in me.

711
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,909
Here's one I'm making up
right here on the spot.

712
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:29,277
"Dawn, can I bring you joy

713
00:30:29,377 --> 00:30:32,327
"like you brung me sunshine?

714
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,416
Can I hold you a minute
and it turns into forever?"

715
00:30:35,516 --> 00:30:36,985
- Do you like that one?
- No!

716
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,921
Okay, how about a spontaneous
tidbit that rhymes?

717
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:41,790
"All my life I've met harlots,

718
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:44,259
"but you are a queen...

719
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:46,161
da, da, da, da, da, da, da...
something between..."

720
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,996
I... I got to work on that one.

721
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,464
Leave me alone.

722
00:30:49,564 --> 00:30:51,199
I can't leave you alone...

723
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:53,001
'cause I'm in love with you, Dawn.

724
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,569
And you're going to be my wife.

725
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:56,037
Listen to me.

726
00:30:56,137 --> 00:30:58,006
You make me sick!

727
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,941
I think you're nothing
but a crazy little freak,

728
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:01,810
and I wish you would
go away and die!

729
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,345
(gasping)

730
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:07,081
(sobbing)

731
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:10,116
(mutters)

732
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:13,201
I... I...

733
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,124
(sobbing)

734
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:19,174
Oh, I'm sorry, hon.

735
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,629
Jenna.

736
00:31:26,729 --> 00:31:27,735
You're always on the phone.

737
00:31:27,835 --> 00:31:28,837
Sorry, this is important.

738
00:31:28,937 --> 00:31:29,971
Yeah, what's so important?

739
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:33,006
Can I please have some privacy?

740
00:31:33,106 --> 00:31:36,091
Hi, uh, is Dr. Pomatter there?

741
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:40,086
This is, um, Jenna Hunterson.
I'm his patient.

742
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,517
(humming tune)

743
00:31:42,617 --> 00:31:44,385
Hi, Dr. Pomatter.

744
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,287
It's Jenna Hunterson.

745
00:31:46,387 --> 00:31:48,556
Um, listen, I'm sure it's nothing,

746
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,459
but you said to call
if I had any concerns.

747
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:55,554
And this morning, um,
I'm bleeding a little bit.

748
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:59,784
No, no, it's very, very light,
like spotting.

749
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,872
Come in to see you?

750
00:32:01,972 --> 00:32:04,739
Okay, uh... tomorrow morning?

751
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,175
You in at 7:00?

752
00:32:07,275 --> 00:32:08,610
Oh, okay, then.

753
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:11,379
Glad you're open so early
so I won't be late for work.

754
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:13,615
Thanks.

755
00:32:13,715 --> 00:32:15,416
See you then.

756
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:18,418
Who are you seeing at 7:00 tomorrow?

757
00:32:18,518 --> 00:32:21,739
Not telling you, 'cause you don't
tell me your secrets neither.

758
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,192
Oh, so this is a secret.

759
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:25,894
No, I'm just going
to see the doctor.

760
00:32:25,994 --> 00:32:28,062
There, that's my big secret.
What's yours?

761
00:32:28,162 --> 00:32:30,565
Can't say. Not yet.

762
00:32:30,665 --> 00:32:32,433
- Why the hell not?
- Well... (gasps)

763
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,236
- Hey!
- Hey!

764
00:32:35,336 --> 00:32:37,572
Don't you have customers?

765
00:32:37,672 --> 00:32:39,440
How come you can't never say
one nice thing ever

766
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,508
like, "How are you, Jenna?"

767
00:32:40,608 --> 00:32:41,943
or "Nice to see you today, Jenna"

768
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,478
or "Great apple pie today, Jenna"?

769
00:32:43,578 --> 00:32:45,880
All you ever say is stuff like,
"Don't you have customers?

770
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,882
- Get out of the kitchen. Get back to work."
- Don't you have customers?

771
00:32:48,982 --> 00:32:52,382
Get out of the kitchen.
Get back to work.

772
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:06,348
##

773
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:22,197
(doorbell rings)

774
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:26,788
Hello, Jenna.

775
00:33:26,888 --> 00:33:27,922
Hello.

776
00:33:28,022 --> 00:33:31,075
Here. I brought you
some "Peachy Keen" tarts.

777
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,994
Wow, thanks.

778
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,263
You're welcome.

779
00:33:35,363 --> 00:33:37,498
- Where's everybody else?
- Uh, I came in a little early

780
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,801
to see you.
Nobody else is here.

781
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:41,636
Oh.

782
00:33:41,736 --> 00:33:44,072
That's why I'm opening the door for you.

783
00:33:44,172 --> 00:33:47,122
- I see.
- So come in.

784
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,649
Now, you say the bleeding was very mild?

785
00:33:54,749 --> 00:33:55,717
Yeah.

786
00:33:55,817 --> 00:33:57,485
And has it stopped?

787
00:33:57,585 --> 00:34:00,535
Yeah, I only saw it the one time.

788
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,043
Okay, good.

789
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,365
Well, you can
get dressed now

790
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,800
and, uh, meet me in my office
when you're ready.

791
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,103
You, you're not going to examine me?

792
00:34:15,203 --> 00:34:16,371
No, no need. No.

793
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,672
Just get dressed and we'll talk.

794
00:34:17,772 --> 00:34:20,722
Okay.

795
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:26,327
(door closes)

796
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:28,683
Hi.

797
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:31,733
Hi. Come on in. Sit down.

798
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:37,492
Oh, my God.

799
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:39,660
(chuckles)

800
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,497
Mm.

801
00:34:42,597 --> 00:34:44,899
Well, am I okay? I mean,
is something wrong with me?

802
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,035
No.

803
00:34:47,135 --> 00:34:48,336
Mm!

804
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:51,383
No, there's nothing wrong with you.

805
00:34:51,483 --> 00:34:53,574
Uh, light spotting
is a perfectly normal symptom

806
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:54,575
in early pregnancy.

807
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:55,910
Were you concerned
about a miscarriage?

808
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,960
Not really.

809
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:02,250
Is that everything you have to say?

810
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,919
Um...

811
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,388
yes.

812
00:35:07,488 --> 00:35:10,438
- No.
- Well, what?

813
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:14,209
I...

814
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,899
Nothing.

815
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:20,735
Um, you can go now.
Uh... I'll see you

816
00:35:20,835 --> 00:35:23,104
at your next regularly scheduled
appointment, and again, don't

817
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,706
- hesitate to call...
- To call you if I have any questions or concerns.

818
00:35:25,806 --> 00:35:28,042
Exactly.

819
00:35:28,142 --> 00:35:30,978
Why'd you have me come
all the way in here

820
00:35:31,078 --> 00:35:33,114
if spotting's a perfectly normal symptom

821
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,482
in early pregnancy?

822
00:35:34,582 --> 00:35:37,702
I mean, I had to get up early,
take a bus, walk five blocks,

823
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,088
just to hear that spotting
is a perfectly normal symptom?

824
00:35:40,188 --> 00:35:43,138
I have no response to that.

825
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:47,645
And what time does this office
normally open, Doctor, 8:30?

826
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:49,530
9:00.

827
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,965
9:00?

828
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:54,185
So-So you came in here two hours
early just to tell me

829
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:56,137
that spotting is a perfectly
normal symptom?

830
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:59,187
Well, it would seem that way, yes.

831
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,710
Good-bye, Dr. Pomatter.

832
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,078
Good-bye, Jenna.

833
00:36:04,178 --> 00:36:05,646
I think you're strange.

834
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,149
I'm not sure I want you
to be my doctor anymore.

835
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,550
You make me uncomfortable.

836
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,119
I'm sorry, Jenna.
I'm really sorry.

837
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:13,421
Whatever it is I do,
I will not do it anymore.

838
00:36:13,521 --> 00:36:15,323
You should not be uncomfortable
at this time.

839
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,399
- You're doing it again.
- How? What did I...?

840
00:36:17,499 --> 00:36:19,827
I don't know, you know,
that nice-guy-talky thing you do.

841
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,137
You just... Oh, forget it.

842
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:30,251
Damn! My purse!

843
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,522
You forgot your pur...

844
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:39,147
(gasps)

845
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:40,648
Hey!

846
00:36:40,748 --> 00:36:43,698
Don't walk away from me.

847
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,690
Well, what do you want?

848
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,289
I want to see you again.

849
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:50,558
I want to talk to you
somewhere outside of here.

850
00:36:50,658 --> 00:36:52,426
Maybe we could have
a coffee or something.

851
00:36:52,526 --> 00:36:55,263
I can't have coffee.
It's on the bad food list you gave me.

852
00:36:55,363 --> 00:36:57,899
- What kind of doctor are you?
- Well, you don't have to have coffee.

853
00:36:57,999 --> 00:36:59,300
You could have water or fruit juice.

854
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,635
That's a bad idea.

855
00:37:00,735 --> 00:37:02,470
I'm married. You're married.

856
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,471
I'm pregnant.

857
00:37:03,571 --> 00:37:04,505
- You're my doctor.
- Uh...

858
00:37:04,605 --> 00:37:06,007
You're right, it's crazy.
It's unethical

859
00:37:06,107 --> 00:37:08,376
on my part. I...

860
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:12,216
(choir chanting
over classical orchestration)

861
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,491
Wait!

862
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:24,892
No kissing in the street.

863
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,527
I have a very jealous husband.

864
00:37:26,627 --> 00:37:27,695
He'd kill you

865
00:37:27,795 --> 00:37:29,664
if he ever saw us.
He don't like when other men

866
00:37:29,764 --> 00:37:30,965
- even look at me.
- Is he large?

867
00:37:31,065 --> 00:37:32,233
He's large enough,
and he drives

868
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,502
- right past here on the way to work.
- Well, maybe we

869
00:37:34,602 --> 00:37:37,238
shouldn't be standing
in the street then.

870
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,706
I've got to go make pies.

871
00:37:38,806 --> 00:37:40,782
It'll take me time to walk
the five blocks,

872
00:37:40,882 --> 00:37:42,825
wait for the bus.
I don't want to be late.

873
00:37:42,925 --> 00:37:44,877
- Cal gets mad when I'm late.
- Let me drive you.

874
00:37:44,977 --> 00:37:46,347
No. Yes.

875
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:49,397
Please.

876
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:57,425
Well, thank you for the tarts.

877
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,594
They were unbelievably delicious.

878
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,062
"Delicious" is not even

879
00:38:01,162 --> 00:38:03,331
a good enough word
for what they are. They...

880
00:38:03,431 --> 00:38:06,406
I mean, what you do with food is...

881
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,570
unearthly.
It's sensual.

882
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,838
Does anybody else appreciate...?

883
00:38:10,938 --> 00:38:11,872
You're welcome.

884
00:38:11,972 --> 00:38:14,922
So, um...

885
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,912
Do we...? I mean, what do we...?

886
00:38:18,012 --> 00:38:19,780
- Dr. Pomatter, I'll call you
- Can I...

887
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,940
if I have any questions or concerns.

888
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,977

What?

906
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:30,685
Your lipstick
is all smudged,

907
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,987
like someone gave you a good one.

908
00:39:33,087 --> 00:39:35,489
I'm going inside now.

all your indiscretions,

No.

948
00:41:10,518 --> 00:41:12,253

- Okay, you can have chocolate milk, okay?
- (screams)

950
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,924
I'm sorry. You can have
as much chocolate milk as you want.

Okay.

954

Jenna, come on.

955
00:41:22,663 --> 00:41:24,647
Listen, you can have
chocolate milk, okay?

956
00:41:24,747 --> 00:41:27,961
Here, darling,
we bought you something,

957
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:29,403
a present.

958
00:41:29,503 --> 00:41:30,838
That's sweet.
You shouldn't have.

959
00:41:30,938 --> 00:41:32,406
Open it.

960
00:41:32,506 --> 00:41:35,456
Okay.

961
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:38,114
Oh, it's a book.

962
00:41:38,214 --> 00:41:41,128
"What a Mama You're Going to Be"

963
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:42,716
Oh, look at that.

964
00:41:42,816 --> 00:41:45,352
We know you didn't initially
have a strong happiness

965
00:41:45,452 --> 00:41:46,554
about this whole baby thing,

966
00:41:46,654 --> 00:41:47,888
but she is coming anyway.

967
00:41:47,988 --> 00:41:49,223
We don't know it's a she.

968
00:41:49,323 --> 00:41:51,325
We figured we'd give you something

969
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,893
that every woman
is supposed to read.

970
00:41:52,993 --> 00:41:55,029
And every woman is supposed
to read something like that...

971
00:41:55,129 --> 00:41:56,197
we think.

972
00:41:56,297 --> 00:41:57,331
Well, thanks.

973
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:00,000
- You best read and absorb it.
- Hey, you know,

974
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,803
I was thinking. Have you ever
heard about those people

975
00:42:02,903 --> 00:42:04,705
who sell their babies
for lots of money

976
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:06,073
through, like, lawyers and stuff?

977
00:42:06,173 --> 00:42:08,342
Jenna, you can't sell your baby.
That's a horrible thought.

978
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,343
I was just thinking,

979
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,845
if I did, I might
make enough money

980
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,279
to finally get away from Earl.

981
00:42:12,379 --> 00:42:14,915
I mean, at this point, the baby
is the only real financial asset

982
00:42:15,015 --> 00:42:16,817
I have if I don't win
that pie contest.

983
00:42:16,917 --> 00:42:20,137
I am going to pretend
that you are not saying this.

984
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:21,922
Not everybody wants
to be a mama, Dawn.

985
00:42:22,022 --> 00:42:24,158
That don't make me a bad person.

986
00:42:24,258 --> 00:42:25,626
You're not getting
any more affectionate

987
00:42:25,726 --> 00:42:26,627
towards that little baby?

988
00:42:26,727 --> 00:42:27,661
Not at all?

989
00:42:27,761 --> 00:42:29,754
I respect this baby's right to thrive.

990
00:42:29,854 --> 00:42:31,031
I do nothing harmful to it.

991
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,467
I don't drink,
I watch my diet, but no.

992
00:42:33,567 --> 00:42:35,803
I feel nothing like affection.

993
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:38,772
Maybe that man smothered
all the affection out of me.

994
00:42:38,872 --> 00:42:41,822
I don't know.

995
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,479
Well, I got to get back to work.

996
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:46,747
Yeah, uh, breakfast crowd's
heating up.

997
00:42:46,847 --> 00:42:48,082
Yeah.

998
00:42:48,182 --> 00:42:49,350
Hey, thanks for the book.

999
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:51,285
All right.

1000
00:42:51,385 --> 00:42:55,272
Jenna, there's all these
cool things to do in here.

1001
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:58,476
Um, there's a little scrapbook
section in the back,

1002
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,745
where you can put pictures
of your pregnant belly as it develops.

1003
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,882
Oh, and there's a place where
you can write your first letter to your baby.

1004
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,133
- Oh.
- Right here.

1005
00:43:06,233 --> 00:43:08,569
Right in the middle.

1006
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:11,619
Okay, Dawn, thanks.

1007
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:18,192
First Letter To My Baby.

1008
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,781
First letter.

1009

OLD JOE:
Where's my water?

1010
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:26,100
"Dear baby."

1011
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:31,525
"Dear baby,

1012
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:34,295
"if I was writing you a letter,

1013
00:43:34,395 --> 00:43:38,560

something like an apology

00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,035
"I know everyone deserves a mama

"who was also a good wife,

1017
00:43:48,549 --> 00:43:51,795
"And I can't rightly say
that I'm any of that.

"and I'm not sure the world
is such a fine place

00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:00,137

win that contest next week

1028
00:44:23,343 --> 00:44:25,613
"What the hell am I going to do
with you then?"

1029
00:44:25,713 --> 00:44:28,663
(Earl groans)

1030
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,122
You sure is getting fat, baby.

1031
00:44:32,222 --> 00:44:33,621

00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,935
"I wish I could feel other things, baby.

00:44:48,035 --> 00:44:50,804

"Love, Mama."

00:45:12,493 --> 00:45:15,443
(horn honking)

1045
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:37,231
Where you going, Jenna?

1046
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,920
Nowhere, Earl.

1047
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,823
I-I mean, to work.

1048
00:45:42,923 --> 00:45:45,873
Then why you got a suitcase?

1049
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:49,663
(groans)

1050
00:45:49,763 --> 00:45:51,365
Earl!

1051
00:45:51,465 --> 00:45:54,865
- Shut up and get in the car.
- (sobbing)

1052
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:06,794
(sniffling)

1053
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:12,119
Pie-baking contest, huh?

1054
00:46:12,219 --> 00:46:17,489
Yeah, I was just going to go up there
and win and surprise you.

1055
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:21,142
No, you're lying.

1056
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:26,417
You ain't never gone to
a contest before in your life.

1057
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,235
You're lying to me.

1058
00:46:28,335 --> 00:46:30,771
Earl, don't...

1059
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,272
Why you lying to me?

1060
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:33,340
I'm pregnant!

1061
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,390
(tires squealing)

1062
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:56,597
When was you going to tell me?

1063
00:46:56,697 --> 00:46:59,615
After I won the pie contest.

1064
00:46:59,715 --> 00:47:03,030
Well, you ain't going
to no pie contest.

1065
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,650
You know what?
You ain't going nowhere.

1066
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:12,279
Here's the thing, wife-

1067
00:47:12,379 --> 00:47:16,400
What if you decide to love
the baby more than you love me?

1068
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,605
Women do it all the time.

1069
00:47:18,705 --> 00:47:22,072
They have a baby and then
it's to hell with the man.

1070
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,160
You're jealous of the baby?

1071
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,926
No, I don't get jealous.

1072
00:47:26,026 --> 00:47:28,695
It's below me.

1073
00:47:28,795 --> 00:47:29,963
I'm just talking it out.

1074
00:47:30,063 --> 00:47:31,265
I'm talking my feelings out.

1075
00:47:31,365 --> 00:47:34,315
And I know how women get.

1076
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:38,640
And I'm just not sure I want
that happening.

1077
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,241
I'd tell you to
get rid of it,

1078
00:47:41,341 --> 00:47:42,743
but I want you
in the same place

1079
00:47:42,843 --> 00:47:46,838
as me in the hereafter,
if you know what I mean.

1080
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:50,050
Maybe if you promise me

1081
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:52,953
that you wouldn't love the baby
more than you love me.

1082
00:47:53,053 --> 00:47:54,221
You know?

1083
00:47:54,321 --> 00:47:56,356
That you'd make
a real effort to love me more.

1084
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,492
If I need something,

1085
00:47:58,592 --> 00:48:00,727
you'd keep taking care of it.

1086
00:48:00,827 --> 00:48:02,262
You'd hold on to me more.

1087
00:48:02,362 --> 00:48:05,312
I come first- not any baby.

1088
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,169
Well, can you make
Early that promise?

1089
00:48:09,269 --> 00:48:11,438
Absolutely.

1090
00:48:11,538 --> 00:48:12,439
Then say "I promise."

1091
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:14,141
I promise.

1092
00:48:14,241 --> 00:48:17,176
Say "I promise I will not love the baby

1093
00:48:17,276 --> 00:48:18,512
more than I love you, Early."

1094
00:48:18,612 --> 00:48:21,014
I promise I will not love the baby

1095
00:48:21,114 --> 00:48:24,064
more than I love you, Early.

1096
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:27,621
How about that?

1097
00:48:27,721 --> 00:48:30,781
We're going to have
ourselves a baby.

1098
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:35,209
A baby boy.

1099
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,899
I bet it happened that night
I got you all drunk.

1100
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,335
(chuckles)

1101
00:48:41,435 --> 00:48:42,703
Where you going?

1102
00:48:42,803 --> 00:48:45,753
Gotta throw up.

1103
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,758
(woman singing Italian aria)

1104
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:55,811
WOMAN:
Mrs. Hunterson, the doctor will see you now.

1105
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:57,684
(door closes)

1106
00:48:57,784 --> 00:49:00,734
Hi there.
I'm Nurse Norma.

1107
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:03,490
I'll be helping Dr. Pomatter

1108
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:06,460
with your ultrasound
examination today.

1109
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,095
You have any questions?

1110
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,430
This is where we look at
the baby's heartbeat?

1111
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,833
Yes, among other things.

1112
00:49:12,933 --> 00:49:14,968
You nervous?

1113
00:49:15,068 --> 00:49:16,904
No. Do I seem nervous?

1114
00:49:17,004 --> 00:49:18,839
Yes, you do.

1115
00:49:18,939 --> 00:49:20,073
That's normal.

1116
00:49:20,173 --> 00:49:22,676
Everybody's nervous before
their first ultrasound.

1117
00:49:22,776 --> 00:49:24,645
I'm not nervous, though.

1118
00:49:24,745 --> 00:49:26,079
Okay, you're not nervous.

1119
00:49:26,179 --> 00:49:27,080
(knock at door)

1120
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,816
Come in. I'm dressed.

1121
00:49:29,916 --> 00:49:31,151
Hello, Doctor.

1122
00:49:31,251 --> 00:49:32,352
Hello, Mrs. Hunterson.

1123
00:49:32,452 --> 00:49:33,587
How have you been feeling?

1124
00:49:33,687 --> 00:49:34,655
Fine.

1125
00:49:34,755 --> 00:49:35,722
No problems?

1126
00:49:35,822 --> 00:49:36,957
Nope.

1127
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,226
You had no questions or concerns
this past month.

1128
00:49:39,326 --> 00:49:42,276
No, I certainly did not.

1129
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,099
Okay, well, lie back.

1130
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:49,769
Uh, Norma, would you get
the lights for me?

1131
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,774
All right,
this isn't going to hurt at all.

1132
00:49:53,874 --> 00:49:55,850
It's just going to be a little cold.

1133
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:58,745
(rubber gloves snapping)

1134
00:49:58,845 --> 00:50:00,080
Here we go.

1135
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:03,130
All right.

1136
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:09,136
Okay, Just a little pressure.

1137
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:13,307
Now what are we looking at?

1138
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:17,597
Ah, there we are.

1139
00:50:17,697 --> 00:50:20,267
We are definitely having a baby.

1140
00:50:20,367 --> 00:50:22,135
You want to see?

1141
00:50:22,235 --> 00:50:23,570
I guess.

1142
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:25,238
Just look at the screen.

1143
00:50:25,338 --> 00:50:26,406
There.

1144
00:50:26,506 --> 00:50:27,975
Everything looks great.

1145
00:50:28,075 --> 00:50:29,142
You see that little...
that flickering

1146
00:50:29,242 --> 00:50:32,195
right there in the middle of the screen?

1147
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:33,714
Yeah.

1148
00:50:33,814 --> 00:50:35,015
Right there.

1149
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,150
That's the heartbeat.

1150
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,653
- Congratulations, Mrs. Hunterson.
- Glory be. Hallelujah.

1151
00:50:39,753 --> 00:50:41,822
Uh, Mrs. Hunterson doesn't really like
to be congratulated.

1152
00:50:41,922 --> 00:50:43,690
Oh, sorry.

1153
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,792
Huh.

1154
00:50:45,892 --> 00:50:48,811
Don't really look like
much at this point.

1155
00:50:48,911 --> 00:50:51,665
Certainly don't look
like no baby yet.

1156
00:50:51,765 --> 00:50:53,741
Well...

1157
00:50:53,841 --> 00:50:56,036
Ah, thank you, Norma.
That's all we need you for.

1158
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:59,038
All done here.

1159
00:50:59,138 --> 00:51:00,340
(door opens)

1160
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,509
Well, there you have it.

1161
00:51:02,609 --> 00:51:04,978
Yeah.

1162
00:51:05,078 --> 00:51:07,214
So I guess we are officially
forgetting about that nonsense

1163
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,915
that happened last month?

1164
00:51:09,015 --> 00:51:10,484
Yes, we officially are.

1165
00:51:10,584 --> 00:51:11,852
I want to apologize for it.

1166
00:51:11,952 --> 00:51:13,520
I almost called you
just to apologize.

1167
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,922
I mean, I was so
stressed out at the time,

1168
00:51:16,022 --> 00:51:17,290
taking on all those new patients.

1169
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:18,425
I hadn't been sleeping well.

1170
00:51:18,525 --> 00:51:20,961
My judgment was not
what it normally is.

1171
00:51:21,061 --> 00:51:23,397
I want you to know
that'll never happen again.

1172
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,731
From now on our relationship

1173
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:28,826
will be strictly a medical
and professional one.

1174
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:33,153
(clattering)

1175
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,745
Jenna, no.

1176
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,795
Not with the door open.

1177
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:44,985
(choir chanting
over classical orchestration)

1178
00:51:45,085 --> 00:51:46,586
JENNA:
"Dear baby.

1179
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:50,607
"P.S. I'd want to be able to
teach a baby such as yourself

1180
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:53,527
"the difference between good and bad,
right and wrong."

1181
00:51:53,627 --> 00:51:55,228
(knocking at door)

1182
00:51:55,328 --> 00:51:57,898
"but it seems I'm not fit
to teach nobody nothing."

1183
00:51:57,998 --> 00:52:00,100
NORMA:
Dr. Pomatter, you still in there?

1184
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,701
You got a phone call.

1185
00:52:01,801 --> 00:52:03,570
I'll be right out, Norma.

1186
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:05,839
Mrs. Hunterson needs to be weighed.
Would you take care of that?

1187
00:52:05,939 --> 00:52:11,634
And you can get dressed.
I'll see you in my office in a few minutes.

1188
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:28,795
Don't do that again.

1189
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,964
Okay, what? Okay, I won't.

1190
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:32,132
Kiss you, you mean?

1191
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,434
No, not that.
I didn't mean that.

1192
00:52:34,534 --> 00:52:37,654
I mean don't go away for
a full month and not call.

1193
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:38,738
No questions or concerns.

1194
00:52:38,838 --> 00:52:39,940
Don't do that.

1195
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,208
This is craziness, Dr. Pomatter.

1196
00:52:41,308 --> 00:52:42,776
Please, call me Jim.

1197
00:52:42,876 --> 00:52:43,977
No, I won't.

1198
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,779
Okay, don't.
Just Dr. Pomatter's fine.

1199
00:52:45,879 --> 00:52:47,447
Dr. Pomatter, this is so...

1200
00:52:47,547 --> 00:52:49,583
I don't want to have another conversation

1201
00:52:49,683 --> 00:52:50,951
about how crazy this is

1202
00:52:51,051 --> 00:52:53,453
or how sorry I am,
or how bad

1203
00:52:53,553 --> 00:52:55,889
my judgment is, or how I'll
never touch you again.

1204
00:52:55,989 --> 00:52:59,176
Not only would I be lying,
but every time I start saying

1205
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:01,264
those things, all that happens
is you attack me.

1206
00:53:01,364 --> 00:53:03,324
- You're right.
- Have you been taking your

1207
00:53:03,424 --> 00:53:04,664
- prenatal vitamins every day?
- Faithfully.

1208
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,233
Any bad morning sickness?

1209
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:07,801
- Not too bad, no.
- No more spotting?

1210
00:53:07,901 --> 00:53:09,636
- No more spotting.
- Good, I'm going to want to see

1211
00:53:09,736 --> 00:53:11,238
you again on Friday
for another appointment.

1212
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:13,140
Do you have time in the afternoon?

1213
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,341
Do you get a lunch break?

1214
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,076
Yeah, but I'll have to ask Becky
to drive me.

1215
00:53:16,176 --> 00:53:18,645
Ask Becky to drive you.
Noon.

1216
00:53:18,745 --> 00:53:21,448
Tell the nurse at the desk on your way out
that you want to be fit in.

1217
00:53:21,548 --> 00:53:25,001
I have to go to St. Mary's now
and deliver a baby.

1218
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:27,754
Because that's what I do.

1219
00:53:27,854 --> 00:53:28,955
Okay.

1220
00:53:29,055 --> 00:53:31,191
Are we on the same page now?

1221
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,493
We're on the same page.

1222
00:53:33,593 --> 00:53:36,543
Good, then.

1223
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:40,414
(banging desk)

1224
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:51,258
I wish it were Friday.

1225
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,085

WOMAN:
Hi there.

1237
00:55:57,565 --> 00:55:58,605
Oh, Dr. Mueller,

1238
00:55:58,705 --> 00:56:01,174
how are you?

1239
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:02,309
I thought you retired.

1240
00:56:02,409 --> 00:56:03,677
Semiretired.

1241
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,979
I'm just out of retirement
for the day, my dear.

1242
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,181
Dr. Pomatter and his wife
had to fly back east

1243
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:10,257
for a funeral this morning.

1244
00:56:10,357 --> 00:56:13,119
Oh, he flew back east with his wife?

1245
00:56:13,219 --> 00:56:15,355
How you feeling?
You doing okay these days?

1246
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:18,441
I'm fine. Just fine. You know,
knocked up and everything.

1247
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,521
Yes, I heard.

1248
00:56:20,621 --> 00:56:22,295
How's it working out
with Dr. Pomatter?

1249
00:56:22,395 --> 00:56:25,314
Oh, he's a great doctor.

1250
00:56:25,414 --> 00:56:27,100
Is he coming back soon?

1251
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,501
I don't really know.

1252
00:56:28,601 --> 00:56:30,136
I think so.

1253
00:56:30,236 --> 00:56:31,838
Today we're going to do
some blood work.

1254
00:56:31,938 --> 00:56:33,640
It's standard stuff.

1255
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,275
Just to see how the baby's developing.

1256
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:37,359
I don't care.
Do I have to do it?

1257
00:56:37,459 --> 00:56:38,945
Yeah, you have to do it.

1258
00:56:39,045 --> 00:56:41,181
You may be a little
weak afterwards,

1259
00:56:41,281 --> 00:56:42,682
so you should
call your husband

1260
00:56:42,782 --> 00:56:44,617
or somebody to come pick you up.

1261
00:56:44,717 --> 00:56:46,119
Yeah, I'll call him.

1262
00:56:46,219 --> 00:56:48,203
Is that pumpkin pie for me?

1263
00:56:48,303 --> 00:56:50,255
Kind of.

1264
00:56:50,355 --> 00:56:52,158
If's just something I invented.

1265
00:56:52,258 --> 00:56:55,208
(whispers):
"Naughty Pumpkin Pie."

1266
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:01,615
(horn honking)

1267
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:13,012
JENNA:
Hey,

1268
00:57:13,112 --> 00:57:14,948
you ever going to tell us
your secret, girl?

1269
00:57:15,048 --> 00:57:16,583
Yes, I am, when I'm ready.

1270
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,017
DAWN:
I've got a secret, too.

1271
00:57:18,117 --> 00:57:19,819
BECKY:
You, Dawn?

1272
00:57:19,919 --> 00:57:22,322
Yes. I have a boyfriend now.

1273
00:57:22,422 --> 00:57:23,323
- (gasping)
-JENNA: No!

1274
00:57:23,423 --> 00:57:24,891
Yes.

1275
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,226
Well, who is he?

1276
00:57:26,326 --> 00:57:27,494
Tell us everything, honey.

1277
00:57:27,594 --> 00:57:29,586
You're never going to believe
it, but, um... you know

1278
00:57:29,686 --> 00:57:31,671
that guy came to the diner
that day, wouldn't leave?

1279
00:57:31,771 --> 00:57:32,665
Name was Ogie?

1280
00:57:32,765 --> 00:57:34,033
Ogie, the stalking elf?

1281
00:57:34,133 --> 00:57:35,201
Yeah, I remember that guy.

1282
00:57:35,301 --> 00:57:38,104
What about him?

1283
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,939
Well, it-it's him.

1284
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,989
(gasps)

1285
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,080
Well, that is wonderful, Dawn!

1286
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:49,215
Isn't it, Jenna?

1287
00:57:49,315 --> 00:57:50,683
Yeah, that's wonderful.

1288
00:57:50,783 --> 00:57:52,759
How'd that happen?

1289
00:57:52,859 --> 00:57:55,121
Well, you know,
he was true to his word.

1290
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,056
He didn't never give up.

1291
00:57:57,156 --> 00:57:58,525
His cousin Pete gave him my number.

1292
00:57:58,625 --> 00:58:00,794
He called me, like,
30 times in one day.

1293
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,262
I thought I might kill him.

1294
00:58:02,362 --> 00:58:04,097
But he got to me.

1295
00:58:04,197 --> 00:58:05,398
He did?

1296
00:58:05,498 --> 00:58:06,533
Yeah.

1297
00:58:06,633 --> 00:58:08,168
Well, he's so passionate.

1298
00:58:08,268 --> 00:58:09,869
He writes me
these spontaneous poems.

1299
00:58:09,969 --> 00:58:12,572
Spontaneous poems.

1300
00:58:12,672 --> 00:58:15,590
Yes, they are poems that just
occur to him right on the spot.

1301
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:17,679
Last night he said to me,

1302
00:58:17,779 --> 00:58:21,765
"Dawn, your face is a brilliant
moon in my empty room."

1303
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:22,982
Aw...

1304
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:24,951
"Your love is
like a beating drum,

1305
00:58:25,051 --> 00:58:26,619
"ba-bum-ba-bum-ba-bum-ba-bum."

1306
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:27,887
Hmm.

1307
00:58:27,987 --> 00:58:30,457
And yeah, I know what you're
thinking, that he's not...

1308
00:58:30,557 --> 00:58:33,507
so pretty... but

1309
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,129
he grows on you.

1310
00:58:36,229 --> 00:58:40,309
And anyway, he's it,
'cause nobody else wants me.

1311
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,203
Well, honey, you probably
shouldn't be with someone

1312
00:58:43,303 --> 00:58:44,804
just 'cause nobody else wants you.

1313
00:58:44,904 --> 00:58:46,906
Yeah, well, you are.

1314
00:58:47,006 --> 00:58:48,341
And you wouldn't know it

1315
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:51,628
to look at him,
but he is a sexual dynamo.

1316
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:52,812
Wow.

1317
00:58:52,912 --> 00:58:54,681
No, you wouldn't know it.

1318
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,316
JENNA:
Well, Dawn,

1319
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:58,117
I sure hope it's making you happy.

1320
00:58:58,217 --> 00:59:00,620
You don't mean that.

1321
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,921
Yes, I do.

1322
00:59:02,021 --> 00:59:03,256
Nope.

1323
00:59:03,356 --> 00:59:05,525
I know what you're thinking,
'cause you called him an elf.

1324
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:08,812
Only 'cause you initially
called him an elf.

1325
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:10,196
- You're jealous.
- No!

1326
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:11,431
You are.

1327
00:59:11,531 --> 00:59:14,067
Because you have the most mean,
controlling husband

1328
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:16,159
in the world,
and you are stuck there!

1329
00:59:16,259 --> 00:59:19,038
But I have found someone
who loves me to death!

1330
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:20,306
Well, let's hope not to death.

1331
00:59:20,406 --> 00:59:21,474
And I am happy!

1332
00:59:21,574 --> 00:59:24,524
Good.

1333
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:28,431
When the fruit pies go in,
would you put this one in with that one?

1334
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:33,121
I'm going to go and clean up now
and set up my station.

1335
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:37,938
We'll see you out there!

1336
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:40,593
Don't say nothing.

1337
00:59:40,693 --> 00:59:41,794
I wasn't gonna.

1338
00:59:41,894 --> 00:59:43,663
I'm not in no position
to judge nobody.

1339
00:59:43,763 --> 00:59:45,131
Neither are you.

1340
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:47,207
I hope I didn't hurt her
feelings too bad.

1341
00:59:47,307 --> 00:59:48,401
She'll be fine.

1342
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:51,170
- Hey, is Cal inside yet?
- Yeah, I saw him.

1343
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:53,907
Think it's time for me
to tell him about the baby.

1344
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,475
You got the oven under control?

1345
00:59:55,575 --> 00:59:56,843
- I do.
- Wish me luck.

1346
00:59:56,943 --> 00:59:59,479
Wishing you luck, honey.

1347
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:00,413
Well, uh...

1348
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:01,714
What?

1349
01:00:01,814 --> 01:00:05,214
It seems I'm almost
five months pregnant.

1350
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:08,588
Yeah, so?

1351
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:10,390
So I just thought I should tell you.

1352
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:11,491
I already knew.

1353
01:00:11,591 --> 01:00:12,892
You did?

1354
01:00:12,992 --> 01:00:14,594
Yeah, I thought everybody knew.

1355
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,496
Oh, who told you?

1356
01:00:16,596 --> 01:00:18,698
Nobody told me.
Nobody needs to tell me.

1357
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:19,899
I mean, look at you.

1358
01:00:19,999 --> 01:00:21,100
What'd you think?

1359
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,069
I thought you went and got fat?

1360
01:00:23,169 --> 01:00:25,338
Truth be told,
as long as you can carry a tray

1361
01:00:25,438 --> 01:00:26,573
and fill a pie tin,

1362
01:00:26,673 --> 01:00:30,159
I don't care
if you give birth while doing it.

1363
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:32,512
Well, I'm relieved.

1364
01:00:32,612 --> 01:00:35,562
I'm not such a bad guy, maybe.

1365
01:00:35,698 --> 01:00:38,117
You're not such a bad guy, maybe.

1366
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:39,986
Well, get out there
and get to work, Jenna.

1367
01:00:40,086 --> 01:00:41,654
Come on. We ain't got all day.

1368
01:00:41,754 --> 01:00:42,789
I'll get to work.

1369
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:45,839
(bluesy music plays)

1370
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:50,210
## (man singing)

1371
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,032
How you doing today, Joe?

1372
01:00:53,132 --> 01:00:55,969
Same bastard as yesterday, Jenna.

1373
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:58,071
How are you?

1374
01:00:58,171 --> 01:00:59,572
Same train wreck.

1375
01:00:59,672 --> 01:01:01,074
And how's the baby doing so far?

1376
01:01:01,174 --> 01:01:04,727
So far so good, no problems,
no birth defects,

1377
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,212
no diseases, whatever.

1378
01:01:06,312 --> 01:01:07,680
Good, good.

1379
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:09,248
How's the bad husband?

1380
01:01:09,348 --> 01:01:10,883
Just awful.

1381
01:01:10,983 --> 01:01:11,985
And the lipstick smudger?

1382
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:13,319
The lipstick smudger?

1383
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:14,687
The dog on the side.

1384
01:01:14,787 --> 01:01:15,922
The affair.

1385
01:01:16,022 --> 01:01:18,015
(whispers):
Shh, Joe, I'm not having no affair.

1386
01:01:18,115 --> 01:01:21,041
Okay, you're not having no affair.

1387
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,763
Want to hear your horoscope
before I give you my order?

1388
01:01:23,863 --> 01:01:24,764
No.

1389
01:01:24,864 --> 01:01:26,866
Too bad, here it is.

1390
01:01:26,966 --> 01:01:29,102
"Aquarius.

1391
01:01:29,202 --> 01:01:32,301
"If, indeed, you're having an affair,

1392
01:01:32,401 --> 01:01:34,474
"it might be a good time to step back,

1393
01:01:34,574 --> 01:01:36,175
"look at your life

1394
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,644
"and reassess things a bit."

1395
01:01:37,744 --> 01:01:39,178
It don't say that in there.

1396
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:40,446
Yes, it does.

1397
01:01:40,546 --> 01:01:44,434
It says, "Even if you have
a miserable, snake husband,

1398
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:47,020
"you probably shouldn't be
having no affair,

1399
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,688
"'cause it's beneath you

1400
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:51,624
"and could make you seem
like a common hussy.

1401
01:01:51,724 --> 01:01:53,720
"Not to mention the pain

1402
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:55,561
you could cause other people."

1403
01:01:55,661 --> 01:01:58,431
You're just making that up.

1404
01:01:58,531 --> 01:02:01,651
This afternoon I want the
"Singing Tuna Fish Casserole"

1405
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:03,369
no pickle on the plate.

1406
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:04,737
Well-done Frenchie fries

1407
01:02:04,837 --> 01:02:09,342
with melted Swiss cheese
and gravy on their own plate,

1408
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,144
and "Jenna's Special Strawberry

1409
01:02:11,244 --> 01:02:13,112
Chocolate Oasis Pie."
You got that?

1410
01:02:13,212 --> 01:02:14,480
I got that.

1411
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:16,573
Give me a smile, Jenna.

1412
01:02:16,673 --> 01:02:19,218
Nobody makes strawberry
chocolate pie the way you do.

1413
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:21,421
Wednesday's my favorite day
of the week,

1414
01:02:21,521 --> 01:02:23,356
'cause I get to have a slice of it.

1415
01:02:23,456 --> 01:02:25,658
I think about it as I'm waking up.

1416
01:02:25,758 --> 01:02:28,261
Could solve all the problems
with the world, that pie.

1417
01:02:28,361 --> 01:02:29,629
You're making too much oft.

1418
01:02:29,729 --> 01:02:31,230
If's just a pie.

1419
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,132
Just a pie?

1420
01:02:33,232 --> 01:02:34,133
It's down right expert.

1421
01:02:34,233 --> 01:02:35,835
A thing of beauty.

1422
01:02:35,935 --> 01:02:39,329
How each flavor opens itself,
one by one,

1423
01:02:39,429 --> 01:02:41,808
like a chapter in a book.

1424
01:02:41,908 --> 01:02:44,961
First the flavor
of an exotic spice hits you,

1425
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:47,058
just a hint of it.

1426
01:02:47,158 --> 01:02:51,501
And then you're flooded with
chocolate, dark and bittersweet,

1427
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,986
like an old love affair.

1428
01:02:54,086 --> 01:02:56,988
And finally, strawberry;

1429
01:02:57,088 --> 01:03:00,376
the way strawberry was always
supposed to taste,

1430
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:01,527
but never knew how.

1431
01:03:01,627 --> 01:03:03,763
In fact,

1432
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,398
I tell you what.

1433
01:03:05,498 --> 01:03:07,700
Forget all the other stuff
I ordered.

1434
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,335
Just bring me the damn pie.

1435
01:03:09,435 --> 01:03:10,803
That's all I want.

1436
01:03:10,903 --> 01:03:12,205
I don't care if it's not

1437
01:03:12,305 --> 01:03:13,206
a well-balanced meal.

1438
01:03:13,306 --> 01:03:15,341
Just bring me the pie.

1439
01:03:15,441 --> 01:03:19,228
Old Joe'll maybe not have much
longer to live, you know?

1440
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:21,581
Then I better bring you the pie
right away.

1441
01:03:21,681 --> 01:03:24,631
Yes'm, you better.

1442
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:30,490
- CAL: I love you!
- Oh!

1443
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:32,625
I love your breast.
I love your breast.

1444
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:34,794
I love this breast! Mmm!
I like this breast, too!

1445
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,929
- Oh!
- (shrieks)

1446
01:03:37,029 --> 01:03:39,022
Uh, there's my order, Cal,

1447
01:03:39,122 --> 01:03:41,082
and I'm going
to need a slice of Oasis.

1448
01:03:41,182 --> 01:03:43,469
Gonna go throw up now.

1449
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:44,771
Jenna.

1450
01:03:44,871 --> 01:03:46,472
- Whoa!
- No, Cal!

1451
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:48,040
-Jenna!
- Hey!

1452
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:51,090
(sighs)

1453
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:53,613
I didn't plan it, Jenna.

1454
01:03:53,713 --> 01:03:54,881
It just happened.

1455
01:03:54,981 --> 01:03:57,016
He's got such nice, strong hands.

1456
01:03:57,116 --> 01:03:58,785
Your poor husband.

1457
01:03:58,885 --> 01:04:00,486
My poor husband
wears a diaper,

1458
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:03,122
curses constantly
and sleeps in a separate room.

1459
01:04:03,222 --> 01:04:04,791
So why don't you
just divorce him then?

1460
01:04:04,891 --> 01:04:07,360
I can't just leave
a sick, crazy, old man.

1461
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:08,861
What kind of person would do that?

1462
01:04:08,961 --> 01:04:11,364
I don't know. What kind of person
has an affair with Cal,

1463
01:04:11,464 --> 01:04:13,533
who's married to Ethel,
who we see all the time?

1464
01:04:13,633 --> 01:04:14,534
He says she's awful.

1465
01:04:14,634 --> 01:04:15,902
Maybe anyone
you stay married to

1466
01:04:16,002 --> 01:04:17,703
for 15 years starts to seem awful.

1467
01:04:17,803 --> 01:04:19,639
But we know Ethel.
She's not awful.

1468
01:04:19,739 --> 01:04:21,723
She tells Cal not to yell at us.

1469
01:04:21,823 --> 01:04:25,128
Hey, you're supposed
to be my friend, not Ethel's.

1470
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:27,547
Having an affair
is a terrible thing to do.

1471
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:30,800
It destroys people's lives, and I don't
want you messed up with all that.

1472
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:31,918
(knocking at door)

1473
01:04:32,018 --> 01:04:33,653
DAWN:
Jenna, there's this cute guy here

1474
01:04:33,753 --> 01:04:34,654
to see you.

1475
01:04:34,754 --> 01:04:37,156
He says he's your doctor.

1476
01:04:37,256 --> 01:04:40,206
That's perfect.
Just perfect.

1477
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:46,265
What are you doing here?

1478
01:04:46,365 --> 01:04:48,349
- You can't just come here.
- I had an hour to kill.

1479
01:04:48,449 --> 01:04:50,002
I wanted to see you.

1480
01:04:50,102 --> 01:04:52,305
Did you make this pie?
It's bliss. Of course you made it.

1481
01:04:52,405 --> 01:04:54,941
I got to get back to work.

1482
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:56,609
- When can I see you again?
- Dr. Pomatter,

1483
01:04:56,709 --> 01:04:59,644
I've been thinking.

1484
01:04:59,744 --> 01:05:01,347
I think we need to end this.

1485
01:05:01,447 --> 01:05:02,849
- No.
- Yes.

1486
01:05:02,949 --> 01:05:04,050
Why?

1487
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,685
Because I feel like
a bad person,

1488
01:05:05,785 --> 01:05:07,587
- and I can't live with that.
-Jenna...

1489
01:05:07,687 --> 01:05:09,055
No, don't say anything.

1490
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:10,957
Don't get all nervous and sweet.

1491
01:05:11,057 --> 01:05:12,358
Don't talk me out of it.

1492
01:05:12,458 --> 01:05:16,198
Just, please, finish your pie
and go. Please.

1493
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,915
I'm sorry.

1494
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:26,085
(country music playing low)

1495
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:30,657
(humming melody)

1496
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,211
Last piece.

1497
01:05:32,311 --> 01:05:34,580
Sold out even faster
than usual today.

1498
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,115
Good on us.

1499
01:05:36,215 --> 01:05:39,165
Thanks.

1500
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,688
Cal...

1501
01:05:42,788 --> 01:05:44,223
Yeah?

1502
01:05:44,323 --> 01:05:47,273
Are you happy?

1503
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:53,242
I mean, would you call yourself
a happy man?

1504
01:05:53,342 --> 01:05:56,452
Well, if you're asking me
a serious question, I'll tell you.

1505
01:05:56,552 --> 01:05:58,938
I'm happy enough.

1506
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:03,118
I don't expect much, give much,
I don't get much.

1507
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:07,053
I generally enjoy whatever comes up.

1508
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:12,685
That's my truth, summed up
for your feminine judgment.

1509
01:06:12,785 --> 01:06:14,220
I'm happy enough.

1510
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:17,270
Why do you ask?

1511
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:21,441
No reason.

1512
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:25,111
(humming)

1513
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:42,915
OGIE:
Good evening.

1514
01:06:43,015 --> 01:06:45,965
Good evening.

1515
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,455
I'm just waiting on Dawn.

1516
01:06:49,555 --> 01:06:51,390
Hmm.

1517
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:54,890
Taking her to Stanton
for a steak dinner.

1518
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:56,929
Gonna be asking her to marry me.

1519
01:06:57,029 --> 01:06:58,331
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1520
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:01,381
There you are.

1521
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:04,754
Dawn, if I had a penny for
everything I loved about you,

1522
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:06,172
I would have many pennies.

1523
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:09,692
(gasps): He's-He's making me
a poem right here.

1524
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,844
Penny for your teeth,

1525
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:15,854
penny for your nose,
penny for your eyes, penny

1526
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:20,042
for your hair, your navel,
penny for your odor.

1527
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:23,302
A dollar for your heart.

1528
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:26,692
Aw, Ogie, thank you.

1529
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:29,742
That sure is sweet.

1530
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:37,336
You two have a good time, you hear?

1531
01:07:37,436 --> 01:07:39,705
Oh, we will.

1532
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:40,940
Bye.

1533
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,990
Where we going?

1534
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:51,050
Waiting for Earl?

1535
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,452
Yeah.

1536
01:07:53,552 --> 01:07:56,672
Hey, I'm real sorry
for what I said before.

1537
01:07:56,772 --> 01:08:00,217
Listen, I love you no matter what you do.

1538
01:08:00,317 --> 01:08:02,256
Okay.

1539
01:08:02,356 --> 01:08:03,195
Okay.

1540
01:08:03,295 --> 01:08:04,196
I forgive you.

1541
01:08:04,296 --> 01:08:05,197
Good.

1542
01:08:05,297 --> 01:08:07,273
Good.

1543
01:08:07,373 --> 01:08:09,969
'Cause this is my little adventure.

1544
01:08:10,069 --> 01:08:11,103
Your little adventure?

1545
01:08:11,203 --> 01:08:12,104
Yeah.

1546
01:08:12,204 --> 01:08:13,639
I'm having me a little adventure

1547
01:08:13,739 --> 01:08:15,474
after many years of lots of nothing.

1548
01:08:15,574 --> 01:08:17,043
You love him?

1549
01:08:17,143 --> 01:08:19,612
Cal?

1550
01:08:19,712 --> 01:08:21,947
I don't know.

1551
01:08:22,047 --> 01:08:23,649
But I love it.

1552
01:08:23,749 --> 01:08:27,036
I love having someone
to look pretty for.

1553
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:31,007
I love waking up and having
something to look forward to.

1554
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:34,107
Something fun and sneaky and sexy.

1555
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,362
He love you?

1556
01:08:36,462 --> 01:08:37,530
He kind of likes me.

1557
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:39,765
He kind of hates me.

1558
01:08:39,865 --> 01:08:41,200
It's fun.

1559
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:43,369
It doesn't sound very fun.

1560
01:08:43,469 --> 01:08:44,403
He makes me forget

1561
01:08:44,503 --> 01:08:47,456
about my invalid husband,
my loneliness,

1562
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:50,786
the dreadful misplacement
of my bosoms.

1563
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:54,727
Becky, I don't know how
to tell you this,

1564
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:57,249
but your bosoms are fine.

1565
01:08:57,349 --> 01:08:58,851
There ain't nothing wrong with them.

1566
01:08:58,951 --> 01:08:59,952
It's all in your head.

1567
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:01,620
What are you talking about?
Are you blind?

1568
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,155
This one's way up here in Maine,

1569
01:09:03,255 --> 01:09:04,757
this one's dangling
down here in Florida.

1570
01:09:04,857 --> 01:09:07,807
(horn honking)

1571
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:10,741
All right, well,
I'll see you tomorrow, honey.

1572
01:09:10,841 --> 01:09:13,265
No, you won't.
Tomorrow's Thursday, my day off.

1573
01:09:13,365 --> 01:09:14,333
Then I'll see you Friday?

1574
01:09:14,433 --> 01:09:16,469
Yeah.

1575
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:19,519
(both chuckle)

1576
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:20,706
All right, bye.

1577
01:09:20,806 --> 01:09:23,756
Bye.

1578
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:33,866
Hey, Porky.

1579
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:37,690
Hey.

1580
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:40,292
Why don't you treat me like a man?

1581
01:09:40,392 --> 01:09:43,342
I don't feel like it.

1582
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:47,547
"I don't feel like it."

1583
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:52,203
Well, what makes you think
you have that option, hmm?

1584
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:54,807
Earl.

1585
01:09:54,907 --> 01:09:55,908
Stop.

1586
01:09:56,008 --> 01:09:58,958
Come on.
Don't tell me to stop.

1587
01:09:59,094 --> 01:10:00,346
Hmm, come on.

1588
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:02,982
I feed you.

1589
01:10:03,082 --> 01:10:06,032
I pay for this house.

1590
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:09,287
I put clothes on your back.

1591
01:10:09,387 --> 01:10:11,380
Come on, Just do what I tell you.

1592
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,225
I won't get too mad.

1593
01:10:13,325 --> 01:10:16,275
Earl, that hurts, come on.

1594
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:24,036
I love you, baby.

1595
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:27,086
I don't care if you're fat.

1596
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:32,191
You're my sweet thing.

1597
01:10:46,572 --> 01:10:49,572
(dog barks in distance)

1598
01:10:57,049 --> 01:11:00,049
(engine turns)

1599
01:11:08,493 --> 01:11:10,913
(dreamy lullaby plays)

1600
01:11:11,013 --> 01:11:15,324
JENNA: "Pregnant. Miserable,
Self-Pitying Loser Pie"

1601
01:11:15,424 --> 01:11:18,630
Lumpy oatmeal with
fruitcake mashed in,

1602
01:11:19,905 --> 01:11:22,905
flambe, of course'

1603
01:11:23,008 --> 01:11:26,008
(doorbell ringing)

1604
01:11:31,216 --> 01:11:33,233
What are you doing here?

1605
01:11:33,333 --> 01:11:35,671
I took the whole day off.

1606
01:11:35,771 --> 01:11:37,406
I don't know.

1607
01:11:37,506 --> 01:11:38,907
I wanted to see you.

1608
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:40,275
You look awful.

1609
01:11:40,375 --> 01:11:41,877
Thanks.

1610
01:11:41,977 --> 01:11:44,813
I mean, you look sad.

1611
01:11:44,913 --> 01:11:47,863
You look really sad.

1612
01:11:48,467 --> 01:11:50,455
It's taken you a long time
to notice this,

1613
01:11:50,555 --> 01:11:54,446
but, uh... I'm not a happy woman,
Dr. Pomatter.

1614
01:11:54,546 --> 01:11:57,226
And I don't want you to save me.

1615
01:11:57,326 --> 01:11:58,560
I don't want to save you.

1616
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:01,610
Don't want to be saved.

1617
01:12:03,915 --> 01:12:06,368
Can I come in?

1618
01:12:06,468 --> 01:12:09,418
No.

1619
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:14,490
Yeah.

1620
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,418
So, what now?

1621
01:12:23,518 --> 01:12:24,987
I don't know.

1622
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:28,340
I thought maybe you could
teach me how to make a pie.

1623
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,425
Seriously?

1624
01:12:31,525 --> 01:12:32,794
Seriously.

1625
01:12:32,894 --> 01:12:35,844
I could do that, sure.

1626
01:12:37,215 --> 01:12:40,215
Come here.

1627
01:12:46,625 --> 01:12:49,625
(gentle pop music plays)

1628
01:12:50,429 --> 01:12:53,429
## (man singing)

1629
01:12:54,533 --> 01:12:55,884
"Dear baby.

1630
01:12:55,984 --> 01:12:58,420
"I hope someday, somebody
wants to hold you

1631
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:01,873
"for 20 minutes straight.
and that's all they do.

1632
01:13:01,973 --> 01:13:03,525
"They don't pull away.

1633
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:05,327
"They don't look at your face.

1634
01:13:05,427 --> 01:13:07,295
"They don't try to kiss you.

1635
01:13:07,395 --> 01:13:09,965
"All they do is wrap you up
in their arms

1636
01:13:10,065 --> 01:13:13,752
"and hold on tight without
an ounce of selfishness to it."

1637
01:13:13,852 --> 01:13:16,852
## (continues)

1638
01:13:21,793 --> 01:13:24,793
(laughing):
I got it.

1639
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:45,380
- And now the berries.
- Berries.

1640
01:13:53,325 --> 01:13:56,325
Okay, I'm finished.

1641
01:14:05,837 --> 01:14:08,837
I can't let the chocolate burn.

1642
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:11,940
I love watching you.

1643
01:14:12,811 --> 01:14:15,430
Once the chocolate's all in,
you'll pour the berries on top.

1644
01:14:15,530 --> 01:14:18,033
JIM: I'll pour the berries on top.

1645
01:14:18,133 --> 01:14:22,128
Mama used to call this
"The Lonely Chicago Pie."

1646
01:14:22,454 --> 01:14:24,806
She made hundreds of
different kinds of pie.

1647
01:14:24,906 --> 01:14:29,161
They all have real strange names,
like "Car Radio Pie"

1648
01:14:29,261 --> 01:14:32,261
or "Jenna's First Kiss Pie."

1649
01:14:39,838 --> 01:14:42,790
Now the berries-you do it.

1650
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:45,841
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

1651
01:14:47,879 --> 01:14:50,565
You know, Mama would keep me in
the kitchen with her,

1652
01:14:50,665 --> 01:14:53,567
and teach me everything
she knew about baking.

1653
01:14:53,667 --> 01:14:56,618
She'd sing to me so sweetly.

1654
01:14:57,622 --> 01:15:01,022
# Baby, don't you cry,
gonna make a pie #

1655
01:15:01,893 --> 01:15:05,803
# Gonna make a pie
with a heart in the middle #

1656
01:15:06,631 --> 01:15:10,201
# Baby, don't be blue,
gonna make for you #

1657
01:15:10,502 --> 01:15:14,412
# Gonna make a pie with
a heart in the middle #

1658
01:15:14,706 --> 01:15:17,706
# Gonna be a pie
from heaven above #

1659
01:15:18,009 --> 01:15:21,324
# Gonna be filled
with strawberry love #

1660
01:15:22,647 --> 01:15:26,047
# Baby, don't you cry,
gonna make a pie #

1661
01:15:26,818 --> 01:15:30,728
# Hold you forever in
the middle of my heart. #

1662
01:15:31,723 --> 01:15:33,108
You are so beautiful.

1663
01:15:33,208 --> 01:15:34,242
No, I'm not.

1664
01:15:34,342 --> 01:15:35,443
You are.

1665
01:15:35,543 --> 01:15:37,612
I'm fat.

1666
01:15:37,712 --> 01:15:38,747
You're pregnant.

1667
01:15:38,847 --> 01:15:40,840
You've got a little baby
growing inside you.

1668
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:42,651
There is nothing more beautiful.

1669
01:15:42,751 --> 01:15:45,701
It's an alien and a parasite.

1670
01:15:46,104 --> 01:15:48,290
It makes me tired and weak.

1671
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:50,125
It complicates my whole life.

1672
01:15:50,225 --> 01:15:51,793
I resent it.

1673
01:15:51,893 --> 01:15:54,763
I have no idea
how to take care oft.

1674
01:15:54,863 --> 01:15:57,199
I'm the anti-mother.

1675
01:15:57,299 --> 01:16:00,068
I don't want to talk
about that no more.

1676
01:16:00,168 --> 01:16:03,321
I want to know
what the hell you're doing here.

1677
01:16:03,421 --> 01:16:05,307
I'm learning how to make
"Lonely Chicago Pie."

1678
01:16:05,407 --> 01:16:09,997
No, I mean what you're doing here,
living in this town.

1679
01:16:10,528 --> 01:16:12,280
My wife.

1680
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:15,150
She just finished med school and
we came here for her residency.

1681
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:17,552
Are you happy with her?

1682
01:16:17,652 --> 01:16:20,602
No, don't answer that.

1683
01:16:21,206 --> 01:16:23,225
I'm happy right now.

1684
01:16:23,325 --> 01:16:25,026
Being here with you.

1685
01:16:25,126 --> 01:16:27,696
That's a good answer.

1686
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:30,746
You make me feel calm.

1687
01:16:30,882 --> 01:16:33,768
You make me feel peaceful.

1688
01:16:33,868 --> 01:16:35,370
I don't feel that much.

1689
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:37,806
I tend to be neurotic.

1690
01:16:37,906 --> 01:16:40,609
And you're so beautiful.

1691
01:16:40,709 --> 01:16:42,344
Keep going.

1692
01:16:42,444 --> 01:16:43,678
And so sexy.

1693
01:16:43,778 --> 01:16:44,880
More, please.

1694
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:47,048
And I could find
the whole meaning of life

1695
01:16:47,148 --> 01:16:50,098
in those sad eyes.

1696
01:16:50,802 --> 01:16:53,802
Wow.

1697
01:17:05,483 --> 01:17:07,002
"Dear baby.

1698
01:17:07,102 --> 01:17:10,755
"Somewhere in the space
between the pie baking

1699
01:17:10,855 --> 01:17:13,742
"and Earl eating it
later that night.

1700
01:17:13,842 --> 01:17:17,262
"began the most intimate
conversation of my life.

1701
01:17:17,362 --> 01:17:20,365
"About my mama,
about how much she loved me,

1702
01:17:20,465 --> 01:17:23,835
"how sad she'd be to see my life
turned out like this.

1703
01:17:23,935 --> 01:17:27,405
"About Earl and how he changed
after we married,

1704
01:17:27,505 --> 01:17:30,058
"became someone I feared.

1705
01:17:30,158 --> 01:17:34,713
"About how lonely it is to be
a woman so poor and so afraid.

1706
01:17:34,813 --> 01:17:37,599
"And then I was addicted, baby.

1707
01:17:37,699 --> 01:17:39,675
"I was addicted
to saying things

1708
01:17:39,775 --> 01:17:42,810
"and having them matter to someone."

1709
01:17:49,294 --> 01:17:51,012
Mm.

1710
01:17:51,112 --> 01:17:55,267
I've never had a real best friend before,
except for my mama.

1711
01:17:55,367 --> 01:17:58,367
You feel like a best friend.

1712
01:17:59,204 --> 01:18:00,755
I have something for you.

1713
01:18:00,855 --> 01:18:02,257
A present.

1714
01:18:02,357 --> 01:18:04,092
A present for me?

1715
01:18:04,192 --> 01:18:05,126
Yes, for you.

1716
01:18:05,226 --> 01:18:07,395
I hope this is not
some damn baby thing.

1717
01:18:07,495 --> 01:18:10,445
No. This is for you.

1718
01:18:13,351 --> 01:18:14,669
- (phone ringing)
- Mm-hmm...

1719
01:18:14,769 --> 01:18:16,404
Excuse me.

1720
01:18:16,504 --> 01:18:17,906
Hello.

1721
01:18:18,006 --> 01:18:19,808
Okay.

1722
01:18:19,908 --> 01:18:22,310
Okay.

1723
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:24,279
Yes. No, Mrs. Hesdra,

1724
01:18:24,379 --> 01:18:26,372
I think that'll be fine.
No, just keep taking

1725
01:18:26,472 --> 01:18:29,117
the painkillers I gave you
a-and stay on the antibiotics.

1726
01:18:29,217 --> 01:18:31,086
Oh, my God.

1727
01:18:31,186 --> 01:18:32,587
No, no, that's fine.

1728
01:18:32,687 --> 01:18:34,255
No, Just...

1729
01:18:34,355 --> 01:18:35,757
Right. If you have
any more problems,

1730
01:18:35,857 --> 01:18:37,025
just call me in two days.

1731
01:18:37,125 --> 01:18:38,526
Okay. You're welcome.

1732
01:18:38,626 --> 01:18:39,794
Take care.

1733
01:18:39,894 --> 01:18:41,463
(hangs up)

1734
01:18:41,563 --> 01:18:44,513
Do you like it?

1735
01:18:45,417 --> 01:18:48,653
It's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

1736
01:18:48,753 --> 01:18:50,638
I had it made for you.

1737
01:18:50,738 --> 01:18:52,307
It must have cost a fortune.

1738
01:18:52,407 --> 01:18:53,441
No, not really.

1739
01:18:53,541 --> 01:18:54,809
You shouldn't have done this.

1740
01:18:54,909 --> 01:18:57,828
I can't buy you nothing back.

1741
01:18:57,928 --> 01:19:00,515
I don't want you to buy me anything.

1742
01:19:00,615 --> 01:19:03,930
Why'd you give this
to me, Dr. Pomatter?

1743
01:19:04,536 --> 01:19:06,121
You know why.

1744
01:19:06,221 --> 01:19:09,171
No, I don't.

1745
01:19:09,841 --> 01:19:11,126
Because I am falling

1746
01:19:11,226 --> 01:19:14,176
head over heels...

1747
01:19:22,253 --> 01:19:26,163
(fiddle and banjo playing
wedding processional)

1748
01:19:42,507 --> 01:19:45,507
(sobbing)

1749
01:19:48,313 --> 01:19:49,831
MINISTER:
We're gathered here today

1750
01:19:49,931 --> 01:19:52,434
to celebrate the love
between Ogie Anhorn

1751
01:19:52,534 --> 01:19:55,270
and Dawn Williams...
to join them together

1752
01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:57,572
in holy matrimony for
the rest of their natural lives.

1753
01:19:57,672 --> 01:20:00,175
Can I say something?

1754
01:20:00,275 --> 01:20:03,225
Sure.

1755
01:20:03,928 --> 01:20:07,073
Spontaneous wedding poetry,
right now.

1756
01:20:09,033 --> 01:20:11,219
The title is "Yes."

1757
01:20:11,319 --> 01:20:14,974
Dawn, every time I look
at you, I think yes,

1758
01:20:16,274 --> 01:20:19,226
yes, we're driven by true love.

1759
01:20:19,326 --> 01:20:21,629
Yes, I'm more than just he who audits.

1760
01:20:21,729 --> 01:20:26,064
Yes, I'm poetry and I'm sex,
and I'm living a dream.

1761
01:20:28,386 --> 01:20:30,405
I am, from now on,

1762
01:20:30,505 --> 01:20:33,208
whoever you need me to be.

1763
01:20:33,308 --> 01:20:36,258
Yes, yes, yes.

1764
01:20:40,265 --> 01:20:42,917
Oh, Ogie.

1765
01:20:43,017 --> 01:20:44,886
(applause and cheering)

1766
01:20:44,986 --> 01:20:47,936
(up-tempo country music playing)

1767
01:20:51,109 --> 01:20:54,109
## (man singing)

1768
01:21:04,689 --> 01:21:07,689
## (continues)

1769
01:21:11,496 --> 01:21:13,848
This reminds me of my third wedding.

1770
01:21:13,948 --> 01:21:15,016
Terry Lynn Lemon.

1771
01:21:15,116 --> 01:21:16,618
She had big ones.

1772
01:21:16,718 --> 01:21:19,804
Joe, that's not a very
respectful thing to say.

1773
01:21:19,904 --> 01:21:22,123
I'm just pointing out
her good qualities.

1774
01:21:22,223 --> 01:21:23,458
She was nasty.

1775
01:21:23,558 --> 01:21:24,926
I'm going to invent

1776
01:21:25,026 --> 01:21:29,701
a special pie for you called
"Old Joe's Horny Past Pie."

1777
01:21:29,914 --> 01:21:32,433
Have to wait a bit, I'm afraid.

1778
01:21:32,533 --> 01:21:34,402
- I'm going in the hospital next week.
- Oh.

1779
01:21:34,502 --> 01:21:35,637
Liver stuff.

1780
01:21:35,737 --> 01:21:37,872
Got to have a piece of it removed.

1781
01:21:37,972 --> 01:21:39,541
Maybe I'll even die.

1782
01:21:39,641 --> 01:21:41,943
Don't be stupid.
You won't die.

1783
01:21:42,043 --> 01:21:44,993
(pop ballad playing)

1784
01:21:51,069 --> 01:21:54,021
If I'd ever met a girl
like you, Jenna,

1785
01:21:54,121 --> 01:21:57,436
my whole life could
have been different.

1786
01:21:59,811 --> 01:22:03,314
You don't even know
what you are deep inside.

1787
01:22:03,414 --> 01:22:06,463
You're not just
some little waitress.

1788
01:22:06,563 --> 01:22:09,304
You understand what I'm saying?

1789
01:22:09,404 --> 01:22:11,506
Not at all, no.

1790
01:22:11,606 --> 01:22:14,836
I'm saying, my whole life
I spent lost.

1791
01:22:16,961 --> 01:22:19,681
If a sign said "go this way",
I'd go the other way.

1792
01:22:19,781 --> 01:22:22,731
Time after time after time.

1793
01:22:23,134 --> 01:22:25,987
I turned the wrong corner,
made the wrong choice,

1794
01:22:26,087 --> 01:22:30,252
went the wrong way,
like a chicken without a head.

1795
01:22:30,775 --> 01:22:32,193
You understand?

1796
01:22:32,293 --> 01:22:34,762
You was a chicken without a head?

1797
01:22:34,862 --> 01:22:37,812
Pie lady, listen to me.

1798
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:40,702
This life will kill you.

1799
01:22:40,802 --> 01:22:42,870
I'm saying...

1800
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:44,973
make the right choice.

1801
01:22:45,073 --> 01:22:46,608
Start fresh.

1802
01:22:46,708 --> 01:22:48,176
It's never too late.

1803
01:22:48,276 --> 01:22:51,194
Start fresh.

1804
01:22:51,294 --> 01:22:53,381
I ain't got no money, Joe.

1805
01:22:53,481 --> 01:22:56,431
Who the hell does anymore?

1806
01:22:56,601 --> 01:22:59,601
And I'm about to have me a baby.

1807
01:23:00,004 --> 01:23:02,973
I know you are, Jenna.

1808
01:23:03,073 --> 01:23:05,660
I know you are.

1809
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:08,820
I was just dreaming
a little for you,

1810
01:23:09,113 --> 01:23:12,113
'cause... all my dreams is gone.

1811
01:23:14,519 --> 01:23:16,537
(horn honking continuously)

1812
01:23:16,637 --> 01:23:19,587
Oh, no.

1813
01:23:35,907 --> 01:23:37,392
(clattering)

1814
01:23:37,492 --> 01:23:38,793
(gasping and murmuring)

1815
01:23:38,893 --> 01:23:40,886
(music stops)

1816
01:23:40,986 --> 01:23:42,946
Jenna...

1817
01:23:43,046 --> 01:23:45,914
I'm very upset with you.

1818
01:23:46,718 --> 01:23:49,137
I'll be waiting in the car.

1819
01:23:49,237 --> 01:23:52,757
You have 30 seconds to get
your ass in gear and join me.

1820
01:23:52,857 --> 01:23:55,857
30 seconds!

1821
01:23:57,495 --> 01:24:00,495
(door slams)

1822
01:24:01,332 --> 01:24:03,785
You wasn't exaggerating.

1823
01:24:03,885 --> 01:24:05,386
Your husband is terrible.

1824
01:24:05,486 --> 01:24:07,462
DAWN:
Jenna...

1825
01:24:07,562 --> 01:24:09,724
- Honey, congratulations.
- Okay, Jenna.

1826
01:24:09,824 --> 01:24:12,774
I'll talk to you later, okay?

1827
01:24:19,717 --> 01:24:20,702
Earl...

1828
01:24:20,802 --> 01:24:22,778
No, you don't say nothing.

1829
01:24:22,878 --> 01:24:24,846
You don't say one word.

1830
01:24:24,946 --> 01:24:27,889
Not one word.

1831
01:24:29,293 --> 01:24:32,180
You just sit there.

1832
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:34,816
Earl, that hurts.

1833
01:24:34,916 --> 01:24:36,718
Open the cabinet

1834
01:24:36,818 --> 01:24:38,820
where the coffee
and the sugar jars are.

1835
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:40,021
I don't want...

1836
01:24:40,121 --> 01:24:43,071
Just open it!

1837
01:24:44,575 --> 01:24:46,894
What is that?

1838
01:24:46,994 --> 01:24:49,030
Jenna, what is that?

1839
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:50,331
Money.

1840
01:24:50,431 --> 01:24:52,066
It's all over the fucking house!

1841
01:24:52,166 --> 01:24:54,001
In cabinets, in drawers,

1842
01:24:54,101 --> 01:24:56,270
under chairs, in closets!

1843
01:24:56,370 --> 01:24:59,320
Money hidden all over my house!

1844
01:24:59,724 --> 01:25:00,742
(whispers):
I'm sorry...

1845
01:25:00,842 --> 01:25:02,826
Yeah, after everything
I've done for you...

1846
01:25:02,926 --> 01:25:05,580
you go and hide money from me?

1847
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:06,848
I'm sorry.

1848
01:25:06,948 --> 01:25:09,898
(sobbing)

1849
01:25:24,715 --> 01:25:28,200
You're the only thing
I ever loved, Jenna.

1850
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:33,391
And you're the only person
to ever belong to me.

1851
01:25:33,491 --> 01:25:36,491
And you having a secret from me,

1852
01:25:36,928 --> 01:25:39,928
it tears me up.

1853
01:25:40,598 --> 01:25:44,253
Why was you hiding money
all over the house?

1854
01:25:45,736 --> 01:25:48,736
I don't know.

1855
01:25:50,007 --> 01:25:53,077
Tell me you was going
to buy me a present.

1856
01:25:53,177 --> 01:25:55,956
I was going to buy you a present.

1857
01:25:56,056 --> 01:25:59,600
Tell me you was going
to su... surprise me.

1858
01:25:59,784 --> 01:26:02,784
I was going to surprise you.

1859
01:26:04,088 --> 01:26:07,088
Just hold me.

1860
01:26:08,893 --> 01:26:11,893
(sobbing)

1861
01:26:19,070 --> 01:26:20,621
(sniffles)

1862
01:26:20,721 --> 01:26:23,671
Truth is, Earl...

1863
01:26:24,775 --> 01:26:27,835
Truth is, I was saving that money...

1864
01:26:30,648 --> 01:26:32,767
for the baby.

1865
01:26:32,867 --> 01:26:35,636
I was going to buy
some nice things-

1866
01:26:35,736 --> 01:26:37,438
a crib,

1867
01:26:37,538 --> 01:26:40,768
toys, layette-
it was all for the baby.

1868
01:26:43,494 --> 01:26:45,913
It was for the baby?

1869
01:26:46,013 --> 01:26:48,963
Yeah, so I could buy a crib.

1870
01:26:50,535 --> 01:26:53,535
Yeah.

1871
01:26:55,606 --> 01:26:59,261
Baby, I want us to...
I want us to be happy.

1872
01:27:02,713 --> 01:27:05,713
I want us to be happy, Jenna.

1873
01:27:10,087 --> 01:27:13,087
(sniffling)

1874
01:27:14,559 --> 01:27:16,547
"Dear damn baby.

1875
01:27:16,647 --> 01:27:18,412
"If'n you ever want
to know the story

1876
01:27:18,512 --> 01:27:20,982
"of how we bought your damn crib,
I will tell you.

1877
01:27:21,082 --> 01:27:23,351
"Your crib was bought
with the money

1878
01:27:23,451 --> 01:27:25,720
"that was supposed
to buy me a new life.

1879
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:28,256
"Every time I lay you down
in that damn crib,

1880
01:27:28,356 --> 01:27:29,357
"I'm going to think,

1881
01:27:29,457 --> 01:27:32,193
"'Damn baby, damn crib'

1882
01:27:32,293 --> 01:27:35,346
"Me stuck like a pin
in this damn life"

1883
01:27:35,446 --> 01:27:37,298
(car door closing)

1884
01:27:37,398 --> 01:27:39,100
Hey, guess what, sugar?

1885
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,802
We got enough money left,
I can buy me a nice video camera.

1886
01:27:41,902 --> 01:27:44,272
Film you being pregnant,
the birth, film the baby.

1887
01:27:44,372 --> 01:27:46,407
Maybe when you get
a figure back we can make

1888
01:27:46,507 --> 01:27:49,627
a few nasty tapes,
if you know what I mean.

1889
01:27:49,727 --> 01:27:52,727
Sounds wonderful, Earl.

1890
01:28:04,075 --> 01:28:07,075
Sit up for me, Jenna.

1891
01:28:16,253 --> 01:28:19,253
(Velcro cuff tearing)

1892
01:28:25,930 --> 01:28:30,350
I wish I could stop everything
and run away with you.

1893
01:28:31,235 --> 01:28:33,921
Me, too.

1894
01:28:34,021 --> 01:28:36,524
Where could we go?

1895
01:28:36,624 --> 01:28:38,617
I would go in a second.
I would drop everything.

1896
01:28:38,717 --> 01:28:41,643
Make it go away.

1897
01:28:43,414 --> 01:28:44,899
What?

1898
01:28:44,999 --> 01:28:47,949
Everything else in my life.

1899
01:28:56,927 --> 01:28:59,927
That's a normal reading.

1900
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:04,986
Jenna, get dressed.

1901
01:29:05,086 --> 01:29:06,787
Meet me outside.

1902
01:29:06,887 --> 01:29:09,056
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

1903
01:29:09,156 --> 01:29:11,759
We're going someplace.

1904
01:29:11,859 --> 01:29:14,809
We might even run away.

1905
01:29:14,945 --> 01:29:17,945
We'll figure it out.

1906
01:29:18,783 --> 01:29:21,783
I mean it.

1907
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:24,005
(boy laughing)

1908
01:29:24,105 --> 01:29:25,740
(classical music)

1909
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:27,942
WOMAN:
Don't you spray me! Don't you dare spray me!

1910
01:29:28,042 --> 01:29:30,035
Hunter, no!

1911
01:29:30,135 --> 01:29:31,812
No! No!

1912
01:29:31,912 --> 01:29:33,280
What did I say?

1913
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:36,330
- (boy laughing)
- Hunter, no!

1914
01:29:37,601 --> 01:29:39,620
Nobody ever tells you beforehand

1915
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:42,950
how ridiculously hard
it's going to be.

1916
01:29:44,308 --> 01:29:47,308
- Come on, Hunter.
- (laughing)

1917
01:30:08,999 --> 01:30:12,654
Dr. Pomatter, I believe
my water just broke.

1918
01:30:14,672 --> 01:30:17,672
(inhales deeply, then exhales)

1919
01:30:26,083 --> 01:30:28,402
Hey, sweetheart.

1920
01:30:28,502 --> 01:30:32,072
Oh, Dr. Pomatter,
this is my husband, Earl.

1921
01:30:32,356 --> 01:30:34,008
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

1922
01:30:34,108 --> 01:30:35,676
Nice to meet you, Doc.

1923
01:30:35,776 --> 01:30:38,446
Excuse me, but could you
get up from that chair

1924
01:30:38,546 --> 01:30:42,031
- so I could sit next to my wife?
- Right.

1925
01:30:46,737 --> 01:30:48,767
I would have brought you

1926
01:30:48,867 --> 01:30:51,559
some candy or flowers,
but I didn't have no time.

1927
01:30:51,659 --> 01:30:52,827
That's okay, Earl.

1928
01:30:52,927 --> 01:30:55,563
I need you to rest now, Jenna.
Big moment coming soon.

1929
01:30:55,663 --> 01:30:57,898
I'll leave you folks
to your privacy. Excuse me.

1930
01:30:57,998 --> 01:31:00,525
- Dr. Pomatter...
- Yes, Jenna.

1931
01:31:00,625 --> 01:31:02,636
I just want to make sure we're
clear about one thing.

1932
01:31:02,736 --> 01:31:05,005
- What's that, Jenna?
- I want drugs.

1933
01:31:05,105 --> 01:31:07,108
I want massive amounts of drugs.

1934
01:31:07,208 --> 01:31:09,410
I want the maximum
legal limit of drugs.

1935
01:31:09,510 --> 01:31:12,179
Noted and understood.

1936
01:31:12,279 --> 01:31:14,115
Oh, do... do you belong here?

1937
01:31:14,215 --> 01:31:15,249
Yeah, I'm kin.

1938
01:31:15,349 --> 01:31:18,299
Joe, hi!

1939
01:31:18,502 --> 01:31:20,554
You having your surgery today?

1940
01:31:20,654 --> 01:31:22,423
Later this afternoon.

1941
01:31:22,523 --> 01:31:24,507
Cal told me you were here.

1942
01:31:24,607 --> 01:31:26,360
Here, I bought you this card.

1943
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:28,596
It's silly.
Look at it later, after all

1944
01:31:28,696 --> 01:31:29,597
the fuss is over.

1945
01:31:29,697 --> 01:31:30,965
- Thanks.
- Put it right next

1946
01:31:31,065 --> 01:31:32,933
- to you on the nightstand.
- I will.

1947
01:31:33,033 --> 01:31:34,635
I remember you.

1948
01:31:34,735 --> 01:31:36,437
You're the husband.

1949
01:31:36,537 --> 01:31:38,038
Yeah, I'm the husband.

1950
01:31:38,138 --> 01:31:40,708
Lucky for you, I didn't take
money out of Jenna's check

1951
01:31:40,808 --> 01:31:43,444
for all the damage you did
in my diner at that wedding.

1952
01:31:43,544 --> 01:31:46,080
Don't say nothing smart-ass.

1953
01:31:46,180 --> 01:31:47,782
I'm leaving.

1954
01:31:47,882 --> 01:31:49,283
Give me a hug first.

1955
01:31:49,383 --> 01:31:52,333
Absolutely not.

1956
01:31:53,070 --> 01:31:55,058
(breathing heavy)

1957
01:31:55,158 --> 01:31:57,158
(groans)

1958
01:31:57,258 --> 01:31:58,592
Earl, if you don't

1959
01:31:58,692 --> 01:32:01,912
put that stinking camera away,
I'm going to smash it.

1960
01:32:02,012 --> 01:32:03,764
(chuckles)

1961
01:32:03,864 --> 01:32:04,899
Earl!

1962
01:32:04,999 --> 01:32:06,801
All right, all right.
(laughing)

1963
01:32:06,901 --> 01:32:09,851
(breathing heavily)

1964
01:32:12,957 --> 01:32:15,957
You're doing great, sweetheart.

1965
01:32:17,061 --> 01:32:18,479
You're doing great.

1966
01:32:18,579 --> 01:32:19,780
What am I doing?

1967
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:22,316
Try and steady your breathing, hon.

1968
01:32:22,416 --> 01:32:24,409
Hi. I'm Francine Pomatter.

1969
01:32:24,509 --> 01:32:26,020
Jim's told me so much about you.

1970
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:29,350
He thinks you're just
a terrific woman.

1971
01:32:30,007 --> 01:32:31,292
So you must be.

1972
01:32:31,392 --> 01:32:32,760
Did I mention my wife
is a resident here?

1973
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:35,529
I think you might have
mentioned that.

1974
01:32:35,629 --> 01:32:38,930
He's so proud of me.
He tells everybody.

1975
01:32:39,030 --> 01:32:41,769
She going to be here
through the whole delivery?

1976
01:32:41,869 --> 01:32:44,855
I mean, are all the residents
going to be here?

1977
01:32:44,955 --> 01:32:46,173
No, no, they were just here

1978
01:32:46,273 --> 01:32:47,842
to witness the administration of the epidural.

1979
01:32:47,942 --> 01:32:49,276
So I'm clearing the room now.

1980
01:32:49,376 --> 01:32:52,326
So everybody out.

1981
01:32:54,665 --> 01:32:58,235
She's fully dilated, Doctor.
I think it's time for her to push.

1982
01:32:58,335 --> 01:32:59,987
Let's go.

1983
01:33:00,087 --> 01:33:03,005
NURSE:
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10...

1984
01:33:03,105 --> 01:33:05,492
(Jenna screaming)

1985
01:33:05,592 --> 01:33:08,542
One, two, three, four,
five, six,

1986
01:33:09,079 --> 01:33:11,599
seven, eight, nine, 10...

1987
01:33:11,699 --> 01:33:14,001
JIM: That was a good one, Jenna.
That was a good one.

1988
01:33:14,101 --> 01:33:16,337
- One, two, three, four, five...
- We're getting close.

1989
01:33:16,437 --> 01:33:18,105
- Good, good.
-...six, seven, eight, nine...

1990
01:33:18,205 --> 01:33:20,941
Good, we're almost there.

1991
01:33:21,041 --> 01:33:23,960
- We're almost there, sugar.
- One, two, three, four, five...

1992
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:27,028
...six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

1993
01:33:27,231 --> 01:33:30,231
I don't want no baby, Earl!

1994
01:33:33,070 --> 01:33:34,655
(baby crying)

1995
01:33:34,755 --> 01:33:37,705
JIM:
Oh, it's a girl.

1996
01:33:41,612 --> 01:33:43,697
EARL:
How do you like that?

1997
01:33:43,797 --> 01:33:47,622
Would you like to cut the cord,
Mr. Hunterson?

1998
01:33:48,018 --> 01:33:50,371
Yeah. Why not?

1999
01:33:50,471 --> 01:33:53,421
(baby crying)

2000
01:33:53,891 --> 01:33:56,891
(applause)

2001
01:34:00,998 --> 01:34:05,002
NURSE:
Would you like to hold your baby, Mrs. Hunterson?

2002
01:34:05,102 --> 01:34:08,102
Mrs. Hunterson.
Did you hear me?

2003
01:34:10,674 --> 01:34:12,860
Are you okay?

2004
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:15,262
Mrs. Hunterson?

2005
01:34:15,362 --> 01:34:18,312
(crying continues)

2006
01:34:20,117 --> 01:34:23,117
Give her to me.

2007
01:34:25,956 --> 01:34:28,956
(baby stops crying)

2008
01:34:35,733 --> 01:34:38,733
Oh, my God.

2009
01:34:44,808 --> 01:34:47,808
Oh, my God.

2010
01:34:56,620 --> 01:34:59,620
(soft ballad playing)

2011
01:35:03,861 --> 01:35:06,861
## (woman singing)

2012
01:35:17,408 --> 01:35:20,408
(laughs)

2013
01:35:25,215 --> 01:35:26,734
Hey.

2014
01:35:26,834 --> 01:35:28,102
Do you remember what I said?

2015
01:35:28,202 --> 01:35:31,038
Don't you go loving
that baby too much.

2016
01:35:31,138 --> 01:35:33,207
I don't love you, Earl.

2017
01:35:33,307 --> 01:35:34,742
I haven't loved you for years.

2018
01:35:34,842 --> 01:35:36,110
I want a divorce.

2019
01:35:36,210 --> 01:35:37,277
(laughing)

2020
01:35:37,377 --> 01:35:38,479
That's not a funny joke.

2021
01:35:38,579 --> 01:35:40,180
We got this new baby here.

2022
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:41,682
Shouldn't be making jokes like that.

2023
01:35:41,782 --> 01:35:44,251
I want you the hell out of my life.

2024
01:35:44,351 --> 01:35:46,327
You are never to touch me,
ever again.

2025
01:35:46,427 --> 01:35:47,721
I am done with you.

2026
01:35:47,821 --> 01:35:50,756
If you ever come
within six yards of me,

2027
01:35:50,856 --> 01:35:55,616
I will flatten your sorry ass,
and I will enjoy doing it.

2028
01:35:59,083 --> 01:36:01,535
Now hold on a second.

2029
01:36:01,635 --> 01:36:04,585
## (continues)

2030
01:36:15,766 --> 01:36:18,766
(cooing)

2031
01:36:25,843 --> 01:36:28,843
Lulu- that's your name.

2032
01:36:30,981 --> 01:36:33,400
Little Lulu.

2033
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:37,240
We're going to have so much fun,
little girl.

2034
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:40,207
We're going to have

2035
01:36:40,307 --> 01:36:43,257
so... much... fun.

2036
01:36:46,630 --> 01:36:49,630
## (fades)

2037
01:36:52,369 --> 01:36:54,221
(door opens)

2038
01:36:54,321 --> 01:36:56,523
BECKY:
Jenna, sweet,

2039
01:36:56,623 --> 01:36:58,258
-you got to wake up.
- Hmm?

2040
01:36:58,358 --> 01:36:59,927
DAWN:
We got to wake you. It's time to go.

2041
01:37:00,027 --> 01:37:02,763
Earl's refusing to pay,
so they're kicking you out.

2042
01:37:02,863 --> 01:37:04,364
- Oh, I can't go home.
- You gonna come stay

2043
01:37:04,464 --> 01:37:06,467
with us for a while till
you get back on your feet.

2044
01:37:06,567 --> 01:37:07,968
You could stay with us,

2045
01:37:08,068 --> 01:37:10,637
but I thought Phil's convulsions
might frighten the baby.

2046
01:37:10,737 --> 01:37:13,373
Oh, I got to see that baby!

2047
01:37:13,473 --> 01:37:15,275
Oh, a beautiful baby girl!

2048
01:37:15,375 --> 01:37:17,111
BECKY:
Oh...

2049
01:37:17,211 --> 01:37:18,412
Look at that little girl!

2050
01:37:18,512 --> 01:37:20,647
Cute little girl.

2051
01:37:20,747 --> 01:37:22,449
Little, tiny baby girl.

2052
01:37:22,549 --> 01:37:24,985
Lulu, the love of my life.

2053
01:37:25,085 --> 01:37:28,060
Hon, we have some bad news for you.

2054
01:37:28,505 --> 01:37:30,502
Old Joe was admitted
to the hospital

2055
01:37:30,602 --> 01:37:31,492
same day you were.

2056
01:37:31,592 --> 01:37:33,327
No, I know, he came by

2057
01:37:33,427 --> 01:37:34,328
to see me.

2058
01:37:34,428 --> 01:37:36,930
Well, he's not doing so well.

2059
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:38,899
In fact, he went into a coma

2060
01:37:38,999 --> 01:37:41,001
and they don't think
he's going to recover.

2061
01:37:41,101 --> 01:37:43,337
No! Oh, poor Joe.

2062
01:37:43,437 --> 01:37:45,413
I know you like him.

2063
01:37:45,513 --> 01:37:48,392
You're probably the only person alive
that likes him, though.

2064
01:37:48,492 --> 01:37:49,443
Becky!

2065
01:37:49,543 --> 01:37:51,378
I'm sorry,
but he's a scaly old gator.

2066
01:37:51,478 --> 01:37:52,846
No, he's dear.

2067
01:37:52,946 --> 01:37:54,948
He came in, he gave me this card.

2068
01:37:55,048 --> 01:37:57,684
Where'd I put that?

2069
01:37:57,784 --> 01:38:00,686
I set it down right over here.

2070
01:38:00,786 --> 01:38:03,624
- Look at the baby. Look at that.
- She's so cute.

2071
01:38:03,724 --> 01:38:06,626
Oh, the tiniest little hands.

2072
01:38:06,726 --> 01:38:08,462
Look at the little nose.

2073
01:38:08,562 --> 01:38:09,763
Oh, she's pretty.

2074
01:38:09,863 --> 01:38:13,433
-Jenna, she's real pretty.
-Jenna, she's...

2075
01:38:14,051 --> 01:38:16,470
# Little girl, little girl #

2076
01:38:16,570 --> 01:38:19,306
# Little baby girl #

2077
01:38:19,406 --> 01:38:21,875
#We love that baby girl #

2078
01:38:21,975 --> 01:38:24,645
# She's the cutest baby in... #

2079
01:38:24,745 --> 01:38:27,695
##

2080
01:38:30,434 --> 01:38:33,434
(chuckles)

2081
01:38:39,743 --> 01:38:42,743
(coughing)

2082
01:38:44,248 --> 01:38:47,248
Is it a nice card?

2083
01:38:48,151 --> 01:38:50,671
Yeah, it's okay.

2084
01:38:50,771 --> 01:38:52,239
He made me a drawing.

2085
01:38:52,339 --> 01:38:53,373
You want to see it?

2086
01:38:53,473 --> 01:38:56,423
Yeah, okay.

2087
01:38:59,229 --> 01:39:00,647
- Oh.
- Hmm.

2088
01:39:00,747 --> 01:39:01,648
Isn't that nice?

2089
01:39:01,748 --> 01:39:04,318
Yeah.

2090
01:39:04,418 --> 01:39:06,520
It's pretty nice.

2091
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:08,922
Jenna?

2092
01:39:09,022 --> 01:39:10,657
Jenna, where you going?

2093
01:39:10,757 --> 01:39:13,193
Oh, they're kicking me out.

2094
01:39:13,293 --> 01:39:14,361
Uh, ladies, would you mind

2095
01:39:14,461 --> 01:39:16,445
if I had a minute
alone with my patient

2096
01:39:16,545 --> 01:39:18,131
to talk to her before she leaves?

2097
01:39:18,231 --> 01:39:19,132
Oh...

2098
01:39:19,232 --> 01:39:20,434
- Okay.
- Okay.

2099
01:39:20,534 --> 01:39:22,135
- Thanks.
- Here, Becky, take her.

2100
01:39:22,235 --> 01:39:23,403
Oh, goodness.

2101
01:39:23,503 --> 01:39:26,039
Come here, baby.
Come here, little baby.

2102
01:39:26,139 --> 01:39:29,626
You come see Aunt Becky.
You come see Aunt Becky.

2103
01:39:29,726 --> 01:39:30,911
Oh, my goodness.

2104
01:39:31,011 --> 01:39:32,312
Thanks, ladies.

2105
01:39:32,412 --> 01:39:33,580
Okay.

2106
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:36,550
Look at you.

2107
01:39:36,650 --> 01:39:39,600
Dawn, look at her face.

2108
01:39:44,408 --> 01:39:47,408
I know what you're thinking.

2109
01:39:48,145 --> 01:39:49,429
No, I don't. That's a lie.

2110
01:39:49,529 --> 01:39:50,931
What are you thinking?

2111
01:39:51,031 --> 01:39:54,856
I'm thinking...
I could never thank you enough

2112
01:39:56,286 --> 01:39:58,572
for everything you've done for me.

2113
01:39:58,672 --> 01:40:01,375
I'm thinking
your wife's around

2114
01:40:01,475 --> 01:40:03,043
and you probably shouldn't kiss me.

2115
01:40:03,143 --> 01:40:05,912
The way she looks at you,

2116
01:40:06,012 --> 01:40:08,962
so much trust.

2117
01:40:11,501 --> 01:40:14,486
So that's it?

2118
01:40:14,586 --> 01:40:16,590
It's over?
I don't have any say in this?

2119
01:40:16,690 --> 01:40:20,077
We could have a big drama here
that gets drawn out for a couple years,

2120
01:40:20,177 --> 01:40:21,528
makes everyone miserable.

2121
01:40:21,628 --> 01:40:25,368
Or we could just end it
right here, you know?

2122
01:40:26,183 --> 01:40:29,183
No body count, Just say bye-bye.

2123
01:40:30,454 --> 01:40:33,454
I'm saying bye-bye.

2124
01:40:35,292 --> 01:40:37,751
Dawn, wheel me off now, okay?

2125
01:40:37,851 --> 01:40:38,945
DAWN:
Off? Okay.

2126
01:40:39,045 --> 01:40:40,914
Wheel me off.

2127
01:40:41,014 --> 01:40:43,964
Wait, wheel me back.

2128
01:40:46,970 --> 01:40:49,456
Here...

2129
01:40:49,556 --> 01:40:52,506
Take this.

2130
01:40:54,411 --> 01:40:57,411
Okay, wheel me off again.

2131
01:41:17,234 --> 01:41:19,222
DAWN:
What the heck was that all about?

2132
01:41:19,322 --> 01:41:21,388
Oh, nothing.
I just had an affair with him.

2133
01:41:21,488 --> 01:41:22,589
(gasps):
Your doctor?

2134
01:41:22,689 --> 01:41:24,491
Yeah, and he's married.
Nice lady, too.

2135
01:41:24,591 --> 01:41:26,159
Jenna!

2136
01:41:26,259 --> 01:41:28,962
I just ended it for good.

2137
01:41:29,062 --> 01:41:31,231
Here, give Lulu to me.

2138
01:41:31,331 --> 01:41:33,467
Okay. Go see your mommy.

2139
01:41:33,567 --> 01:41:34,968
(whispers):
Hi!

2140
01:41:35,068 --> 01:41:38,468
Geez, I never seen a baby
this beautiful.

2141
01:41:39,956 --> 01:41:41,808
You ever seen a baby this beautiful?

2142
01:41:41,908 --> 01:41:44,858
No.

2149
01:42:26,722 --> 01:42:28,755
# Gonna make for you #

2150
01:42:28,855 --> 01:42:32,765
# Gonna make a pie

# Baby, don't you cry,

# Hold you forever
in the middle of my heart. #

Bye!

2160
01:43:47,567 --> 01:43:49,336
Bye!

2161
01:43:49,436 --> 01:43:52,105
- Bye, y'all!
- Bye-bye!

2162
01:43:52,205 --> 01:43:54,241
How do you say "good-bye"?

2163
01:43:54,341 --> 01:43:55,709
Bye, bye, bye!

2164
01:43:55,809 --> 01:43:57,444
