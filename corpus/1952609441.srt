00:00:02,762 --> 00:00:06,168
Too Young to Die?
- Dias de Violência -

2
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,833
There!

3
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,428
He is there inside!

4
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,639
Amanda Sue Bradley, you are arrested
murder and kidnapping.

5
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,996
Come on.

6
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,479
- Name! Louder.
- Amanda Sue Bradley.

7
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,273
- Age!
- 15

8
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,078
- Hands off!
- You said so last night!

9
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,351
- What is it?
- I gotta go to work.

10
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,950
- Come on.
- You do not leave me no choice.

11
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,389
Merry Christmas, Mom.

12
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:03,153
You will make yourself breakfast.
Stepfather already started drinking beer.

13
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,633
You get to keep care of yourself today

14
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,397
I have to go.

15
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,229
- Thank you sweets.
- Please.

16
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,631
- Merry Christmas, Harvey.
- It does not feel too good today.

17
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,231
- Do not take it.
- Your mom says here what I do.

18
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,151
- Why do you have Christmas stockings? You're 14
- Until next month.

19
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,991
You look from day to day
more woman.

20
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,719
- Guys will find you?
- No. Go away, I shall wear.

21
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,714
Dress up, I did not stop you.

22
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,436
- Stop!
- I am your father.

23
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,792
I love you as much
as any father.

24
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:23,998
- I've seen the boys' heads.
- Do not do it! Not again.

25
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,749
Every Christmas we celebrate together
The birth of Jesus for a miracle.

26
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,432
Today, we consider
birth is a miracle of our own.

27
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,874
Each of us is a work of art
created in God's image.

28
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,028
It is a miracle that we will never
may be taken for granted.

29
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,870
Now, during the year iloisimpana -

30
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,792
honor God
and also to ourselves and our loved ones.

31
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,833
Those who gave us life.

32
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,078
The god of wisdom, said:

33
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,590
"Honour thy father and thy mother."

34
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,032
They are unable to do for you
anything you want.

35
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,950
- I liked it.
- Stop lying.

36
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,799
I have not been married for years in all.

37
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,277
Men are not an aberration, as soon
without good reason.

38
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,309
How long is it going?

39
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,476
A few months.

40
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,350
I'll tell you, because I do not want to
her longer to do it.

41
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:57,191
Stop. Why do not you tell
earlier, if you like it?

42
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,632
Because I knew
wanted him to be here.

43
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,880
I do not need favors.
I know how the man held.

44
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,230
Tell him
to go from here.

45
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,079
Yes, he leaves.

46
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:22,639
And I'm going under. I
and Harvey has big plans.

47
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,959
It is best that you stop that.
Otherwise, you're out of patterns.

48
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,594
I have done enough in front of you.

49
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,473
Now it's my turn.

50
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,953
- Brian, I'm struggling.
- How so?

51
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:04,279
I do not know
what am I supposed to do.

52
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,794
Surely not all that bad can be.
I'll help you.

53
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,708
- I want to marry you, Mandy.
- Do you?

54
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,674
Yes.
Mom wanted me to go into the army.

55
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,352
But the implementation of the 18 next month, so
I can marry without his permission.

56
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,029
We are getting married,
so we have each other all the time.

57
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,711
- Does that mean that you love
me? - Of course I love.

58
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,277
- Is it true?
- I want you to marry me.

59
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,075
- Do not you want?
- Can we buy your own home?

60
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,193
Of course, tyhmeliini.
I have a full-time at the workshop.

61
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,950
And you do not need to go to college.
When you are married, so no need to.

62
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,755
Oh, God! We are going to get married.

63
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,793
Dinner? They have muffins.

64
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,595
It is healthy, a lot of nuts.

65
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,828
Heating was turned off two
months. You had to buy blankets.

66
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,270
- You did not leave money.
- If you had a job ...

67
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,235
I'll try.
I gave my name to trade.

68
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,832
- Where are you going?
- Refrigerators, if I die en route.

69
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,717
Should go to the army,
I could get at least a decent meal.

70
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,798
- Hey, Mandy.
- Where's Mom?

71
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,552
They left North Dakota a couple of
weeks ago. Harvey got a job.

72
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,595
Damn. Brian and I had a quarrel.

73
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,635
- You can stay with me if you want.
- No, thanks.

74
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,635
The last three months
were the worst of my life.

75
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,072
I do not want you anymore.
We had better be separated.

76
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,432
I have a chance in the army.
Go to her mother.

77
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,470
Why did he do that?

78
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,992
Why?

79
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,915
Amanda.

80
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,315
- I'm Buddy Thornton.
- Arrange for me out?

81
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,000
I will defend you.

82
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,069
Defend? I have not done anything.

83
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,990
- Good. Then witnessing it.
- I have not been proven.

84
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,355
- Annie know his girlfriend.
- Annie Meacham ?

85
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,314
- He is a witness for the prosecution.
- What does it mean?

86
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,389
- He says you did it.
- How so? He did not see anything.

87
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:12,311
- Sort me out.
- That I'm trying to do.

88
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,992
You try? Does the prior prison
contact should be found guilty?

89
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,432
- It will be decided at trial.
- Where is the trial?

90
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,869
We start from the beginning.

91
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,950
You will be charged with murder, and the State
keep you reading as an adult.

92
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,551
They have witnesses, motive,
the gun and fingerprints.

93
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,070
There is no one
that you should not be guilty of -

94
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,069
and lawyers have not had before
murder, so goes the matter.

95
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,671
Otherwise, we will have difficulties
and you had the gas chamber.

96
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,754
I did not do anything.

97
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,273
It is gratifying to hear.

98
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,800
I go to meet with prosecutors.

99
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:12,155
I'm going to find out what evidence
he has. Then we start to work.

100
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,753
Wait!

101
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:23,035
Can you buy me
coated chocolate candies?

102
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,678
- Of course.
- My mother gave them when I was sick.

103
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,316
Do you want
that I play even if your mom?

104
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,070
Last I heard of their living accommodation
mobile home in North Dakota.

105
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,718
- Maybe I can find him.
- I've tried. He's not there.

106
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,354
Hey, wait ...

107
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,995
Do not forget the sweets?

108
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,076
No, I do not forget.

109
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,593
- Morning. You are disturbed.
- I want out. I can not breathe.

110
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,837
I asked for hours. One hour.

111
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,472
I'd come right back.
Devil's Guard.

112
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,759
- We do not provide it.
- Whose side are you on?

113
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,671
You have to. I am a lawyer.
I will do everything to get you out.

114
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,952
Do you think I did not do it?

115
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,073
Yes.

116
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,590
Do you believe
I'm trying to help you?

117
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,998
Then we start work.

118
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,832
- Thank you, sir.
- Buddy.

119
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:11,796
Amanda. I know that you have been
difficult to find reliable people.

120
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,071
Do not pity me.

121
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,556
I know that you have been rejected.

122
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,069
I point guards
throw you out, Billy.

123
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,112
- Hey!
- Well, but, hey!

124
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,792
Would it work here, that I may
something to eat and sleep?

125
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:17,313
- I am very hungry. I do what
only. - You're not.

126
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,037
Your best bet is to go back
home. You should not stay here.

127
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,717
- Life is tough, huh?
- Yes it is.

128
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,594
- Did you come by bus?
- I, I hitchhiked.

129
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,748
- What do you escape? - I am looking for my husband
Army Base.

130
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,429
- Your husband?
- Are you masquerading as a child?

131
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,677
I'm old enough, I know something about it.

132
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,920
- Do you recognize a friend when you see one?
- I think so.

133
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:10,478
- Billy Canton, a friend.
- Stop it, Dracula.

134
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,388
- What is your name?
- Amanda Sue Bradley.

135
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,991
Mandy! This is not
a good place for you.

136
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,829
- Have not you ever been hungry?
- I'm so hungry.

137
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,717
- I am ... - Give the girl something to eat.
Hamburger?

138
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,231
For hamburger.
But the house offers, does not this guy.

139
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,390
Sit down here and ...

140
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,991
- Maybe I can help you. OK?
- OK.

141
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:52,837
People have lost their
confidence. We belong together.

142
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:59,195
- What do you want to drink?
- A soda, please.

143
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,869
- I gotta call.
- There.

144
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,273
North Dakota services, thank you.

145
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,348
Does not exist, therefore,
Sledge, Harvey, or Wanda?

146
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,958
- Is it successful?
- I do not know what I do.

147
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,596
- I'll arrange for you to sleep.
- I do not have the money.

148
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,271
I can help too.
Will arrange for you to work.

149
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,473
- Really?
- Do you recognize a friend when you see one?

150
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:53,199
- I told you that I will help you.
- But what about the waitress?

151
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,313
How can he help you?
You need a job, right?

152
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,352
Come, then.

153
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,468
You were very hungry. Eat. Keep
eat well, that remains nättinä.

154
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,309
You nät player.

155
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,989
- Have you ever danced in the disco?
- Yes.

156
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,554
Good. Let's go inside.

157
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,119
Does this not to be ashamed of.
Many of the top models started here.

158
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,279
- Why?
- Because of that, posing on stage.

159
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,110
- Dance a little. Yes, you know.
- I'm in this clothing.

160
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,994
- You dance in a disco.
- I do not like that.

161
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,591
Too bad, you would have earned
easily be $ 60.

162
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:54,273
- $ 60?
- Yes. Dress up. I'll be right back.

163
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,749
I've got a new one.

164
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,678
- How old?
- Enough.

165
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,598
- Vanempi than the previous one?
- Yes.

166
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,029
- Music?
- Something naughty.

How to get to anything,

You're no longer a child,
so do not behave like a child.

- Sort him out of here.
- He is better looking than the others.

186
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,436
We agreed on $ 100 a girl.
But it must also occur.

187
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:49,193
- How old is he? Hardly 19

- Take it easy. Give us 20
minutes. - OK, and then right back out.

00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,074
Give her chocolate.

00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:27,516
You were really good.
So good that you get to sleep with me.

00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:32,191
- Good, sleeping.
- This will take you to bed.

00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,273
Jump inside.

197
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,834

and a place to sleep.

203
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,037

- I see.

204
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,709
Then go back.

205
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,274
Unfortunately, I can not.

206
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,950
You will not get far.

207
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:34,312
Hey!
Sorry, I thought you were in second place.

208
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:40,993
- Do you know where I could get the room for the night?
- I do not. Varotko bit. Thank you.

209
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:59,032
- Police looking for you.
- Maybe they can help me.

210
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,436
When you look there,
they put you in jail.

211
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,636
My wife baked them.
I hope you like petit fours.

212
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,515
Your wife? Tell him thank you.

213
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,315
- Is the food good?
- Ruokaako it is?

214
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:59,116
Brian criticized my cooking skills.
He should be here in a week.

215
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:07,076
- Do you have children?
- 5-year-old girl. You meet him yet.

216
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,630
Will you okay?

217
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,151
Yes. We will get along well.

218
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:25,274
What about you? Do you have a
or anyone close to love?

219
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,995
- Jean.
- Jean bowling?

220
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:34,433
Sometimes when you meet someone, you feel as soon as
as if old friends.

221
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:40,874
So I had some and Jean. He was
as a sister. I loved him.

222
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,232
I remember once, when me and Billy
we purchased an apartment and ...

223
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:51,879
- Wait. Do you purchase an apartment?
- I did not want to live in his car.

224
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,232
He had a job.
Or he would empty the stores ...

225
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:02,993
- You did not say that the other one said.
- What is it?

226
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,150
We need to show
that you were trying to get rid of him.

227
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:14,718
I tried. As soon as I would have gotten
point is in order, I would have gone.

228
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,070
Listen to me now.

229
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,228
This is important. If we can not
to prove that you were trying to leave ...

230
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:26,478
What about the first evening Hornessa?
You could ignore him.

231
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,833
- You had $ 60.
- No. We received a payment once a week.

232
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:38,149
I got the money on Friday
and Billy always took sides.

233
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,795
It was a Black Stocking?

234
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,837
Jean!

235
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,869
- Jean! Come on, I have it.
- Amanda!

236
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,878
Where are you? I have the tape.

237
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,758
I love this. But I would have to
have saved money apartment.

238
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,757
Kidding.

239
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,396
Ellen, I have found the homes of Charles
Street, twins found.

240
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:44,753
- Lying?
- I swear. I'm leaving him.

241
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,634
- Billy Päästikö you off?
- He does not know yet.

242
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:54,357
- I can deal with him.
- This is the best so far.

243
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,237
- How much do you pay rent?
- Too much. Looking for a partner for residence?

244
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:05,434
- No, I already have one.
- What do you mean?

245
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,394
- Just that. Me and Frank.
- Menettekö married?

246
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,114
- Yes.
- Heaven! When?

247
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,917
Next month.
And I go to a bowling alley and I say:

248
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,669
"Carl, you can push
that your work wherever you want! "

249
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,918
I get the child's first year.

250
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,318
- But now we consider you asioitasi.
- Do not carry me to worry.

251
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,752
You need to get out
strippauskerholta and Billy's flames.

252
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,431
I go here when I have enough
old to get an ordinary job.

253
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:45,192
- I'm looking for a man and a family foundation.
- Do not talk to the kids.

254
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:52,032
- You're still a child herself.
- I got married before you, huh?

255
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,675
- Is it enough for you people?
- I have never been enough.

256
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,077
Hello. Enter the cola on the rocks.

257
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,272
- Billy's looking for you.
- I have no doubt.

258
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,075
- He seems angry.
- I do not doubt it either.

259
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,870
- Thank you.
- My name is Mike.

260
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,675
- I have not seen you before.
- I am walking around.

261
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,633
Beer.

262
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,513
- Where have you been?
- You do not own me.

263
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,634
- Did not I nice!
- I do not owe you anything.

264
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,991
I care about you.

265
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,872
Let me go.

266
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,710
A woman can not be beaten.

267
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,077
- Do you come from?
- Out!

268
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,512
Mandylle I've said for a long time,
that would leave that filth.

269
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,315
- Are you okay?
- Will not hurt anything.

270
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,637
- Thank you.
- Please.

271
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,274
- What's your name again?
- Mike.

272
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,837
I'm Amanda Sue.
"Amanda Problem", met with the mother of to say.

273
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,673
Can I buy a beer?

274
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,476
I can not stand it.
I do not whiskey. It is strong.

275
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,229
- How old are you?
- 18

276
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,797
Almost. 17 and a half.

277
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,832
I guess that's not dinner?

278
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:08,069
- Why are you so interested?
- I do not know. Yet.

279
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,548
- Still? I like that.
- Let's get out of here.

280
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:20,232
- We eat some good food.
- I have to do some work.

281
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:25,798
I could pick you up later.
I can put you some food with me.

282
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,878
It would be nice.

283
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,235
He does not seem like that.

284
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,353
Do you know how old he is? 14.

285
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,189
- What the hell is she doing here?
- He wants to eat.

286
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,959
We go in and eat something.

287
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,356
Home sweet home. Mixed with ...

288
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:14,680
But I ask ...
Why do not you're told 14-year old?

289
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,557
- I'm not a child.
- You should not be such a place.

290
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:25,356
If it is so filthy,
Then what are you doing there?

291
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,550
I do not know.

292
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,909
I'm not proud of it. I'm divorced
and lonely. I miss my kids.

293
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,350
- Do you have children? How many?
- Two.

294
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:42,315
I have this big house. You can live
free of charge as long as you want.

295
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:47,355
And you can be quite calm. En
children get tangled and you have a child.

296
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:53,112
You would want to live here for a
time doing what you do.

297
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,073
- Why?
- It's not right.

298
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,637
- You need a yes taloudenoitajan.
- Yes.

299
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,911
Come on. You can live lastenuoneessa.

300
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:12,870
Make yourself at home. They will not come until
Sunday. I am a neighboring room.

301
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,478
This is absolutely wonderful.

302
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,110
- You can take me in your lap if you want.
- No.

303
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:36,075
- Why not?
- I told you already.

304
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,668
Good night.

305
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,828
Nice ...

306
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,193
Just take a look.
I guess you fall from heaven.

307
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,880
Yeah, I guess.

308
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:19,274
"The world is my game;
Rumbleston is my name. "

309
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,678
No, not so. Rumpelstiltskin.

310
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,356
Bedtime.

311
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,917
- Daddy says that the rush movement.
- Good night.

312
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:43,636
I like that they are happy,
never sad.

313
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,273
- I Am I responsible for?
- Yes.

314
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,393
- Hello.
- I want to meet you.

315
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,115
- Billy?
- Do not turn off. I want to meet.

316
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:05,199
- Go to hell.
- Do not say that.

317
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:10,838
- Who is it? Canton?
- End the harassment of a girl.

318
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,589
If you still do it,
you have to deal with.

319
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,475
Mike.

320
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,319
What's wrong?

321
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,149
Mandy, please.

322
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,192
I like that you hold me in your lap.

323
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,590
I really am afraid for him.

324
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,435
Clear.

325
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,879
Now he does not get you.

326
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:33,558
He likes me. I quit work,
and moved with him.

327
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,353
- Huijaatko?
- It is clear!

328
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,314
You met a month ago.
He is a soldier.

329
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,353
He does not.
I've looked at already lapsiinkin.

330
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,600
- Does she have children? How old is he

331
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,589
- Great.
- I'll bring him to Denver.

332
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,269
- I do not want to leave you here.
- The decision was yours.

333
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,076
Frank got a job there,
so we can go there to get married.

334
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,638
- I was supposed to be a bridesmaid.
- You can still be.

335
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,832
- Come with us.
- Where I lived?

336
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,158
With us until you find your own.
Frank agreed to do so.

337
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:21,957
- I'm only 14 What kind of work I get?
- We invented something.

338
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,230
- Oh, Jean!
- Do it.

339
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:29,036
I do not want to miss Mike.
I love her and she me.

340
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:34,109
- You do not even know him.
- We come to visit, you'll see then.

341
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,074
- What about Billy?
- I do not meet him again.

342
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,316
Good.

343
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,071
I do not want you to go.

344
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,515
I know it.

345
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:20,149
- Out, troops.
- I'm out.

346
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,558
- Hey, Mandy!
- Hey!

347
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:29,754
Hankin frisbee which you wanted to.
Go there.

348
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,158
- Hey.
- Give a hug.

349
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,550
Look at that.

350
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:49,199
- They tried to hit me in the club.
- We can not forget.

351
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,637
Sergeant Medwicki. I came to visit
Lieutenant Billings.

352
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,948
One, two, three, go.

353
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,753
Hello. Father's need to go inside.

354
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,551
Hello.

355
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,199
I talked to the grocery store with a woman.
He said the same thing as you.

356
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:00,519
- That I could get a high school ...
- Mandy, we need to talk.

357
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,395
Sit down.

358
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,399
- We are in big trouble.
- What do you mean?

359
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:26,436
There are people who do not want to
we live together.

360
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,839
- What then?
- My boss does not want.

361
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,475
- He got to know that you are a minor.
- So?

362
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:41,118
We have not lived in reality.
This does not happen. You need to be changed.

363
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,751
- What do you mean?
- I have a court martial.

364
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,759
I lost a challenge to the law.

365
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,395
- Because we live together?
- Yes.

366
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,798
- And then?
- You have to go away.

367
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,710
- I can not do this thing.
- You can not say that.

368
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:15,313
Try to understand. The army is my life.
I sacrificed it for eight years.

369
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,752
I need to feed their children.
I do not have anything else.

370
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:28,036
I can not leave. You know how much
I love you. Do not you love me?

371
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,995
It is not that.
We are cheating ourselves.

372
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,113
I gave you my love.
I gave it to you.

373
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:43,314
- It asks me to jail, lose my kids!
- No!

374
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,954
Yes! You were not there!

375
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:51,871
- We are the children and explain to them.
- Too late.

376
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,678
You ...
Maybe you could try to find your mother.

377
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:05,558
My mother? He threw me out!
He threw me out!

378
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:13,394
Help me!

379
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,034
Love me!

380
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:24,676
Mandy, I'm sorry.

381
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,197
Really sorry.

382
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,476
Okay ... Okay!

383
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,670
- No, Buddy.
- He is a child. He has 15

384
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,430
- How can you blame him for adulthood?
- This is not shoplifting.

385
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:05,317
This is a brutal murder. Do we lay him
just stand in the corner for a moment?

386
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,955
- He did not do it.
- Say it with Annie Meacham  ille.

387
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:13,631
- There was a man. The knife was his.
- It was Amanda's fingerprints.

388
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:19,756
- You know as well as I ...
- Buddy, you need to know something.

389
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:29,629
Documents;
when they brought him inside.

390
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,629
It is not valid
because the lawyer was not present.

391
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,913
- You lied to me!
- I'm not.

392
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,795
This is an acknowledgment that
that you have signed up.

393
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:52,839
I did not want to sign up.
The man forced me to.

394
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:58,398
- Amanda, why do not you tell me?
- I do not know.

395
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:03,435
I believed the whole story.
I believed you.

396
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:08,953
- Is loppukin a lie?
- No, I'm told the truth.

397
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:13,153
- Why does not anybody listen to me?
- Now listen to me.

398
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,876
I can not help you,
if you are not honest with me.

399
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,632
It is in Denver.
Jean Glessner.

00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:43,029
Yeah, she got married.

402
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,635
Okay.
One will be all over the place.

403
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:54,958
What happened? Heittikö out of the military?

404
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:59,676
How do you know?

405
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:04,749
- You told them about it?
- Yes. I did it because of you.

406
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:11,071
- You bastard! Why?
- Mandy!

407
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:18,116
Wait! Wait!

408
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,159
- Go away!
- He wanted only one thing.

409
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:29,115
- I know that you liked him.
- You saw him only once.

410
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:33,916
I've seen her buy a hundred times
what you gave for free.

411
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,712
- Valetta.
- Really?

412
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:41,198
Ask for street girls, they are
all been Medwickin with.

413
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,838
Where do you live, Mandy?

414
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,798
- Go away!
- I do!

415
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:05,153
I love you a lot. I'm the only one.
Why are you so bad for me?

416
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,398
- I love Mike.
- He does not love you.

417
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:14,913
- He got rid of you quickly.
- I want to die.

418
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:20,637
- Let me die.
- No, you do not want to die.

419
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:27,359
- You need to get a good feeling. Please!
- I do!

420
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,474
If he had loved,
He did not reject you.

421
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:41,116
I will never abandon you.

422
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:49,676

00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:07,759
Good people are being exploited.
You were stupid and you are violated.

00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,355
No it does not matter

426
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,709
So I try to teach you.

00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:34,111
- Nobody cares a shit, huh?

428
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:42,552

I've been worried about you.

434

- No, he was not so hard to find.

437
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,478
- Do you know him?
- It's a long story.

438
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,956
I tried once to help him.

439
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:28,833
My God, I hate him.
Why has he abandoned me in that way?

440
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:35,149
Forget him. You are with me.

441
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:40,718
I needed him so much.
Why did he do to me so?

442
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:54,955
- What are you doing?
- A good dose.

443
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,640
You forget everything.

444
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:04,116
- Does it hurt?
- No.

445
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,597
Close your eyes and count to five.

446
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:24,197
Do you feel better?

447
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,594

Not my friend anyway.

We pay him.

452
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,596
Finished.

453
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,353
Neat bitch.

454
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:44,639
- Hey, baby.

455
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:49,276
- What the hell is this?
- What is he doing here?

456
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,676
If you want to talk to, I can leave.

457
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:03,554
Mandy, what are you trying to do?
What do you want?

458
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,593

459
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:11,508
- Do not throw me out!
- What do you do for us?

460
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:16,589
- Mandy, we resolve this together.
- Why, dear?

461
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:21,874
- We can agree on.
- You violate my daughter again.

462
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,913
- It is true.
- Yes.

463
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:32,075
- Children are sleeping.
- My children.

464
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,472
- Mandy!
- Shut up!

465
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,910
- Get dressed.
- Everything will be all.

466
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,510
- Everything's fine.
- Do not make him evil!

467
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:50,958
Do not worry, little ones.

468
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,719
Amanda, we're leaving.

469
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,238
Bound by that bastard.

470
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:07,914
- Stop.
- Now we'll go for a ride.

471
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:14,070
- Let's go. One, two, three, four ...

472
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,794
Everything will be okay.

473
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,120
Billy, honey ...

474
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,869
There behind.

475
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:50,631
Mandy, why are you doing this?

476
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:23,916
- Out of the car. Come on.
- This has gone too far.

477
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:29,433
- What is this? They are engaged to be married.
- It's not an engagement ring.

478
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:35,117
- What are you are you going?
- Come on, Amanda.

479
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:40,837
- Give him to me.
- It goes like I planned.

480
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,669
Shut up. Turn around.

481
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:50,750
Everything will be okay.
Mandy, do not make him evil.

482
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,954
- Why are you doing this?
- You have a problem.

483
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:00,790
- Mandy!
- Shut up, asshole.

484
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:04,037
I cut you into pieces, the pig.

485
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:09,314
- I've never done anything to you.
- You can say goodbye to him now.

486
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,194
You love her.
How are you doing this?

487
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:16,710
- Now it's too late!
- Mandy! Mandy!

488
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:22,517
Shut up!
Do not talk shit.

01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:27,589
Stop. Come back, bitch.

Mandy comes.
He is available, or what?

492
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:43,475

01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:51,837
- You like it, huh?
- God.

494
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:55,236
He gives you!

495
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,954
Dear God ...

496
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,910
Mike! Mike!

497
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:17,992
I was so stoned,
and around the place so much.

498
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:25,715
I can not understand ...

499
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:30,868
I really loved Mike.

500
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:17,750
Good morning, pretty lady.

501
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,678
I throw up.

502
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,034
Where are you going?

503
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,074
- How are you?
- What must it be?

504
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,078
- Tank full.
- Okay.

505
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:11,392
- Shit, the cops.
- Hey, where are you going?

506
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:26,196
- I guess you at the seat of someone you know?
- Mickey could probably help us.

507
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,515
I kept.

508
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:44,389
- What are we doing?
- Take it easy.

509
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:48,479
Now it's just you and me.

510
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:52,957
- What is it with these?
- That last one there.

511
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:01,992
- Here. That's Mickey.
- Be properly then.

512
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:10,909
- Hey. Is it Mandy?
- Yes.

513
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:15,750
I did not recognize you.

514
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:18,997
- Billy. Nice to meet you.
- Mickey.

515
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:23,159
- Amanda, is that you?
- Hey, Miss Blaylock.

516
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,192
Come inside.

517
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:30,393
- You look so different.
- I made him a woman.

518
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:34,149
We are a honeymoon in California.
Is not that right, honey?

519
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:39,354
- What has happened to your hands?
- Accident.

520
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:44,235
- Can I borrow jeans and a T-shirt?
- Of course.

521
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:49,229
- I'll have one beer.
- Please.

522
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:53,433
- I am proud that you came to visit.
- Can you help me?

523
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:56,074
- How are you doing, honey?
- Well.

524
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:59,431
- What did you say just now?
- Nothing.

525
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:05,874
- Do not be pushy bride.
- Come on. I've known him always.

526
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:11,597
Anyhow ...
Need to buy a beer. It is the end.

527
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:17,353
- Can I wash up a bit?
- Of course, not at home.

528
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:20,790
- We see the point.
- You and me.

529
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:37,875
Mary? Birdie here. Can you imagine
Amanda and one guy just came.

530
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,878
He has Mickey in a caravan.

531
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,679
Makes 5.95.

532
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:13,993
Oh, I forgot my wallet Amanda.
Can you handle this until I get it?

533
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:17,635
- Yes, I guess.
- Thank you. You are fair.

534
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:29,591
- I can see that for the second time today.
- Get in the car.

535
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,874
Get out of the car.

536
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:34,675
- Walk your hands up.
- I'm glad this is over.

537
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:40,716
He's lying.
He cheated on me all the time.

538
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:46,238
I really loved him.

539
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,949
There!

540
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,640
He is there inside!

541
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,559
Showing him!

542
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:48,553
Whether the jury made a decision?

543
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:53,071
- Yes we are.
- The defendant please rise up.

544
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,390
What's the verdict?

545
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:03,277
Mr. Chairman, we have found
the accused guilty.

546
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:09,109
Order in the court!

547
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:17,036
Would you like to give an opinion?

548
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:23,308
- What does this mean? I going to die?
- You do not.

549
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:27,194
- The jury was against us.
- This is not over yet.

550
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:33,270
- They May recommend Mitigation.
- Do Something, Buddy, I do Not want to die.

551
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:36,995
I do everything,
Which for me is Possible.

552
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,554
I do Not want to die.

553
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,158
Some do not do it.

554
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:02,193
Act was punishable by death.

555
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:05,357
They viilsi man's throat.

556
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,752
This is too demanding for me.

557
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:17,998
15-year-old girl's life
is in my hands, and ...

558
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:29,712
This is too much for me. This would
Salomon ... Really big ...

559
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,037
This is what just happened, Buddy.

560
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,111
You can do this?

561
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:43,075
To sentence him to death
and go home to sleep.

562
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:49,753
How old is Cathy? 12?
Think of him going to the gas chamber.

563
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:58,798
Many of the children whose lives have been as
Amanda, read by doctors.

564
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,718
He made a choice.

565
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,592
I do not want to see anyone die.

566
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,752
How could this have had?

567
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:32,589
Jean. How did you find me?

568
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:37,999
- That was the news in Denver.
- Denver up?

569
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:43,319
I'm trying to find your mother.

570
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:49,959
I called every damn
RV area throughout the country.

571
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:54,551
When the mother says that he goes
he is serious.

572
01:14:54,680 --> 01:15:01,518
- What is Frank doing?
- Good.

573
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:06,589
He runs his brother garages.

574
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:14,070
- Nice. Have you had a child yet?
- I'm pregnant.

575
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:20,070
- Great. When?
- In August.

576
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:26,548
- Which one is it?
- We do not know.

577
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:32,073
- We want to surprise.
- I do not. Let me know immediately.

578
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:35,909
I will not tolerate uncertainty.

579
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:46,754
What happened?

580
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:57,478
I do not know.

581
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,676
He was ...

582
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:12,030
If you get a baby girl,
can you give him the name Mandy?

583
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:15,994
Annan.

584
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,714
I would consider it.

585
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:30,915
I would have been a good mother.
A really good mother.

586
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:13,034
All that arise.

587
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,558
Seated.

588
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:26,154
Now the time has come
declare the punishment.

589
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:29,909
Lawyers,
Prepare to loppuyhteenvetoonne.

590
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:38,589
Jurors, you deserve the honor
wise, brave decision.

591
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:43,748
You have brilliantly kept separate from
facts and references -

592
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:46,838
innocence and youth.

593
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:51,033
Decision respects
the only innocent in this affair, -

594
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:55,392
the victim, Michael Medwickiä.

595
01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:00,833
It would be easy to give
Amanda Sue Bradley -

596
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:04,270
benefits of compassion.

597
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:08,154
We hope that his
life would have been easier.

598
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:15,197
The truth is that he had enough
old deprive another person.

599
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,993
He killed a man.

600
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:23,752
The father of two small children.

601
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:30,319
He has to suffer
the consequences of their actions.

602
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:33,955
And to be executed.

603
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:38,710
If Amanda's criminal
would be an isolated incident ...

604
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:44,073
If he had only a teenager,
whose offense is punishable by death -

605
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:49,638
should be taken into account
mitigating circumstances.

606
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:53,548
It is sad that Amanda is a part -

607
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:58,959
growing problem,
toward which our country is going.

608
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:03,471
You know, read the magazines.

609
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,275
Every day there are stories
15-year-old gangs -

610
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:14,750
that riot all cities
the streets, killing and raping.

611
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:20,477
12-year-olds go armed.

612
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:27,756
It is a new kind of youth,
and Amanda is one of them.

613
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:32,317
We must give a clear message
for all the world Amado -

614
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:36,831
that they can not get off the hook
after pahuuksiaan.

615
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:41,351
He must die for their crimes!

616
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:52,913
We must protect the innocent,
God-fearing citizens -

617
01:19:53,040 --> 01:20:00,037
In this ...

618
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,230
... And this.

619
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,795
Thank you.

620
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,034
Mr. Thornton.

621
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:28,716
Before turning to the question,
what to do with Amanda Sue Bradley -

622
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,957
Let us ask first
ourselves is one thing.

623
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:38,155
How can we who are here now,
we could find ourselves in that situation?

624
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:43,035
A situation in which the Oklahoma
Land to ask you -

625
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:46,994
to send a 15-year-old girl
the gas chamber.

626
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:52,911
We know how Amanda Sue
faced with this situation.

627
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:58,592
As early as age 14, his stepfather was
repeatedly raped her, -

628
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:04,875
mother and 18-year-old husband were
abandoned him, and he had been sold -

629
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,992
strippauskerhoon with men -

630
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:13,433
such as Billy Canton pumped him
drugs, and used.

631
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:22,233
Amanda wanted most in life
love and family.

632
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:27,036
Michael Medwicki placed his hands on his
around and promised all that.

633
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:32,951
He moved to the man,
and the point they ended up in the same bed.

634
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:37,392
And just like everyone else,
he dismissed her.

635
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:45,632
He returned to the single world, which
and knew where Billy was waiting for Canton.

636
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:54,312
I do not want to belittle what happened to
Hornessa oil field, Oklahoma.

637
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:59,036
It was tragic.
But tragedy is also ours.

638
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:02,391
Amanda is a child of our time.

639
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:06,957
The prosecutor is right in saying that
a lot of kids who are on the street.

640
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:12,279
But if he is guilty,
society is also to blame.

641
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:18,032
Designed to protect children
this sort of abuse -

642
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:22,790
and rejections,
but we have failed in it.

643
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:28,870
Do you want to hide that mistake now
sending him to the gas chamber?

644
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:34,358
Do you want to condemn him to death,
before he gets the opportunity to live in?

645
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:42,473
You have condemned him to the crime.

646
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:50,199
Send him to jail,
but do not kill him.

647
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:45,589
- Have you made a decision?
- Yes.

648
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:50,949
Will the accused rise
and approached the judge.

649
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:02,670
Read the court decision.

650
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:08,352
We have unanimously decided
that the defendant was sentenced to death.

651
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:14,791
Execution by lethal gas is
After 30 days.

652
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:28,592
When will they come?

653
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,870
Point.

654
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:38,229
They take me to the death cell.

655
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,838
I'm dying now.

656
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,833
I'm dying now.

657
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:31,790
1989 U.S. allowed
at least 16 years of age executions.

658
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:36,789
Currently, 28 teens
waiting on death row.
