1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:04,604
(eerie music)
 (hiss)

2
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,698
(melodious, haunting music)

3
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:02,996
- How's the second floor?

4
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,531
- Everyone's asleep.

5
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,933
Just another quiet night.

6
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:10,470
(distant shriek)

7
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,206
(rasping)

8
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,374
What the hell?

9
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,179
- I'll check outside.

10
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,681
- I'll check the second floor.

11
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:27,220
(water drips)

12
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,349
(bestial moan)

13
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,685
(low groan)

14
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,701
(low rumble)

15
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,973
(discordant music)

16
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,148
- Who is that?

17
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,583
(low rumble)

18
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:41,528
(dramatic music)
(choking)

19
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,864
(growling and snorting)

20
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:49,068
(squishing and tearing)

21
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,137
(cackle)

22
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,941
(bestial moan)

23
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,912
(shriek)

24
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,718
(ripping and growling)

25
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,720
- What the hell is that?

26
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,028
(roar)

27
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:18,398
(growl)

28
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,232
(scream)

29
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,833
(crunch)

30
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:24,304
(high-pitched keening)

31
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:28,074
(distant screams and growls)

32
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:37,083
(ominous music)

33
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:12,819
- [Gruff Voice] From hell
 it came, born from darkness

34
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,155
by the Old Ones,
before the time of man.

35
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,708
It is a traveler
  between the realms

36
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,277
of this world and the next,

37
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:43,282
used to protect the secrets
 of the Five that are One,

38
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:45,852
the Lords of Darkness and Evil.

39
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:06,739
The creature was first
 summoned by alchemists

40
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:10,009
searching for these
 arcane secrets.

41
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:14,180
They were unaware of the toll
 that they would have to pay.

42
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:34,767
Those who call the beast
 must make an offering to it,

43
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,837
five lives to
 appease its masters.

44
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,107
Only then will it return
to the shadowy world

45
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,675
from which it came.

46
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:04,163
The abomination can be
 controlled by the one

47
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:07,333
who summoned it,
 only if he can bestow

48
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:12,438
the mark of the beast
 to the five chosen.

49
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:15,108
(primal shriek)

50
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,526
For them, there is no salvation,

51
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:38,231
for he who hears the
creature's bloodcurdling shriek

52
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,699
is doomed.

53
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,368
(primal shriek)

54
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,226
- [Zak] So, do you have a major?

55
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,862
I mean, I know you can't
pick one officially yet,

56
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:10,897
but do you have one?

57
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,398
- [Clark] Yeah.

58
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,634
- [Zak] It's not something
 pointless like media studies

59
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:15,735
or education, is it?

60
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,771
- [Clark] No it's, it's math.

61
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,273
- [Zak] You're a math major?

62
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,842
- Yeah, and I've never even
 owned a pocket protector.

63
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:25,378
- I don't believe all those
 cliches about math majors.

64
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,813
- Yes you do. (laughs)

65
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,514
- Okay, I do, but I'm
 working really hard not to.

66
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:29,348
- Oh.

67
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,484
- No glasses, huh?

68
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:35,188
- No, better than 20/20 vision.

69
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,756
Look...

70
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:37,690
- Zak.

71
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,791
- Zak, I appreciate you trying

72
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,692
to be roommates or whatever--

73
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:40,960
- Oh, it's my pleasure.

74
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,929
I was in the same bind
 when I was a freshman.

75
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,130
- What I really
 need to know though

76
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,565
is what it's gonna cost,
because money-wise--

77
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,732
- It's free.

78
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:47,733
- It's free?

79
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,404
- And then again, it isn't.

80
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:54,740
It's great housing for free,

81
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,409
but you can never
 tell anybody about it,

82
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,144
you can never give
 anyone your address,

83
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,012
you can never bring
 anybody by there,

84
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,148
all your mail goes
  to a P.O. box,

85
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,517
no calls except
 through a cell phone.

86
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,286
Now those are the absolute
  rules of the house.

87
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,120
- Okay, I get it.

88
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,655
You're squatting.

89
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,157
- Some might call it that.

90
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,893
- Well, what is it, and
old house or a building?

91
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:14,727
What?

92
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,731
It's a hospital?

93
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:21,467
- It's been empty for
something like 50 years.

94
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,202
The county owns it.

95
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,338
It beats sleeping in the park.

96
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:29,508
We took off their key and
 padlock and put on our own.

97
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,513
You have to keep it
 locked at all times.

98
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:38,718
We don't want anyone coming
back and finding the gate open.

99
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,487
Here, I made you a copy today.

100
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:42,989
Your key to the merry kingdom.

101
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:46,259
(Clark laughs)
 Come on.

102
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,596
Hey look, everybody's here.

103
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:51,430
- Hi.

104
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,265
- Hey.

105
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,972
- Okay, Clark, this is David.

106
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:00,806
He started it all.

107
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:01,908
He was here first.

108
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:02,875
- David.

109
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,076
- Clark, huh?

110
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,878
- Yeah, it was my
 mother's family name.

111
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,280
It's a Protestant thing.

112
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,281
(Elaine chuckles)

113
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,782
- David's in pre-law.

114
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,584
Mike over here is in
mechanical engineering,

115
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:15,187
so whatever water and power
 we have, he's the man.

116
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,322
- I'm not gay.

117
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,790
- I'm sorry?

118
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,059
- Just 'cause I have short
  hair and a great body,

119
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,228
I don't want you
  to think I'm gay.

120
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,429
- Okay.

121
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:27,466
- I mean, I've slept
with 17 different women,

122
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,502
and not one of 'em was a man.

123
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:30,636
- Fine.

124
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:34,273
- I've got a girlfriend,
two girlfriends.

125
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:37,777
I'm obsessive compulsive,
  but I'm not gay.

126
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,446
- This is Tanya.

127
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,814
- Comrade.

128
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,049
- I beg your pardon?

129
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,650
- Tanya's not her real name.

130
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,652
What is it, Tammy or something?

131
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:49,255
She's into this whole
 anachronistic Red Army thing.

132
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:53,225
- What David doesn't realize
 is when the revolution comes,

133
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:56,195
the lawyers are gonna be
  first up against the wall.

134
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,430
- I'm telling you,
  you need a beret.

135
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,231
It'll make the whole
 image complete.

136
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,566
- Keep laughing.

137
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,736
Are you taking any
  poli sci courses?

138
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,137
- No, not really.

139
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,540
- Um, this is Elaine.

140
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,374
- Hi.

141
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,442
- Hi.

142
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,609
- [Zak] She's a bit quiet.

143
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:12,545
She's in pre-med.

144
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,214
- So, what's the procedure?

145
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,382
- Turn around.

146
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,086
Any vetoes?

147
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,723
You're in.

148
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,157
Let's go.

149
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:28,394
We've all staked out
  rooms on the second floor.

150
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,895
- Why the second?

151
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,131
- Well as you can see, the
 first floor's full of junk.

152
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,366
There's some furniture
 in the basement

153
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,767
if you want to look
 around down there.

154
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,935
Do you have a thing about rats?

155
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,470
- Um, yeah.

156
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,271
- Then you might not want
 to go down to the basement.

157
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,306
- Don't worry.

158
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,540
Every Thursday's
big garbage day.

159
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,576
That's when people throw
out their furniture.

160
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,844
- A few rules.

161
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,145
We got the windows
 on two blacked out.

162
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,546
You can't have any light
anywhere in the building

163
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,248
where it could be
 seen from the outside.

164
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,017
There's no smoking, no visitors.

165
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,752
An open secret is no secret.

166
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,488
You want to sleep with a
  guy, you go to his place.

167
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,456
- So we're the only
 ones in the hospital?

168
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,824
- Just us six.

169
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,459
Nobody else lives here.

170
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,594
Nobody else even
  knows we're here,

171
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,462
and that's the way we want it.

172
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,564
They had a kitchen back
in the nurse's station.

173
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:06,766
Electric range.

174
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:09,402
You want to use it,
 you clean it up.

175
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,905
These are all the old
 semi-private rooms up here.

176
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:16,175
Zak's there, Tanya,
 Elaine, Mike.

177
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,744
That side's ward B over there,
 and that's where I live.

178
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:19,979
- You have a whole ward?

179
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,714
- I've got a lot of stuff.

180
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,249
I was also here first.

181
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:24,583
You want a ward?

182
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,951
There are four of
 them in the hospital,

183
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,154
as well as three
  buildings in the compound.

184
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,689
You clean one out, you can
  have one to yourself too.

185
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:31,690
You can live anywhere you want.

186
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,225
It's up to you.

187
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:36,962
Lock your space up, don't,
  that's also up to you.

188
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:40,032
Tanya here likes to
 keep her space locked.

189
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,600
- So do you.

190
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,803
- Yeah, but I believe
 in private property.

191
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:47,573
- Then you shouldn't be living
 in someone else's building.

192
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,475
These guys don't
  want to admit it,

193
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,578
but this, this is
  communal living.

194
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:53,412
- Yeah.

195
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,880
Oh yeah.

196
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,282
- This is urban pioneering,
 and we're staking out

197
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,784
unwanted territory
 that's going to waste.

198
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,820
- Actually, I think this is
 just a bunch of college kids

199
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,655
who need a cheap place to live.

200
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:06,258
(Clark laughs)
 Pick a room.

201
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,603
- I'll take it.

202
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,339
- [Zak] Clark, you
  realize you picked

203
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,574
the best room in the house.

204
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,409
(water dripping)

205
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,844
I really hope that you like it.

206
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:28,147
Seriously, it's so much
 better than living in a dorm.

207
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:32,885
(distance obscures Zak's voice)

208
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,154
(rattling)

209
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,640
(eerie music)

210
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,515
(shrieking)

211
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,919
(bestial moan)

212
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,091
(shriek)

213
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,703
(bestial moan)

214
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,275
(exerted breathing)

215
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,609
- God, are you okay?

216
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:31,844
- Yeah.

217
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:32,878
- Do you want some
 water or something?

218
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:33,712
- Yeah.

219
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,717
- Here.

220
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:39,852
- Thank you.

221
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:40,686
Oof!

222
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,789
- Look, um, Zak I really
appreciate the help

223
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,291
you've been giving me.

224
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,092
- That's okay, but this
  is the last of it, right?

225
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:47,927
- Yeah.

226
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,061
- Okay. (laughs)

227
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:49,962
Oof.

228
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,630
- What do you think?

229
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:53,632
- It's awesome.

230
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:54,466
- Yeah.

231
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,536
- Hey uh, do you
 want to go celebrate?

232
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,839
You know, get a
 cocktail or something?

233
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,073
- Oh--

234
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:01,774
- I mean, I have to
 catch my breath first.

235
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:02,975
- Yeah.

236
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,677
Well actually um,
 well I have some work

237
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,712
I should do around
 here, and I actually,

238
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:07,680
I should study, so--

239
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,647
- Oh hey, no problem.

240
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,115
I'll um, I'll see you around.

241
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,984
- But, but...

242
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,485
Well Zak, I just
  meant not tonight.

243
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:14,720
I mean, maybe later--

244
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,554
- Hi there.

245
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:16,388
Oh, I'm sorry.

246
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:17,623
- Did you see Zak?

247
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,658
- Yeah, I think he just
headed down the hall.

248
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:20,492
Anyway, look.

249
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:21,660
No pressure or anything.

250
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,895
- What?

251
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:23,896
- But these are some
 pamphlets, all right?

252
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,998
Students For a Better World.

253
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:26,932
- Oh.

254
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,401
- And The Truth About Socialism.

255
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,203
Now you don't have to
  read them, but if you do,

256
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,304
and you want to talk.

257
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,572
- Thanks.

258
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,608
- We have meetings every
Tuesdays and Thursdays,

259
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:36,442
and if you'd like to come--

260
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,811
- Communism is dead!

261
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,847
- Go tell that to
 Two Bang Red Chinese!

262
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:42,681
Fuck off.

263
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,819
So, if you want to just
  come hang out some night,

264
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,287
we'd really like
you to be there.

265
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,888
It's not like a high pressure
 kind of thing, all right?

266
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:52,358
- I'll look at them if
 I get a chance, okay?

267
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,192
- Oh that's great!

268
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,126
- Yeah.

269
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:54,860
- That's great, all right!

270
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,095
- Okay.

271
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,464
- Okay, so, no hard sell
or anything like that.

272
00:14:58,464 --> 00:14:59,632
- No, okay.

273
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:00,466
- All right, okay,
I'll talk to you later!

274
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,001
- All right, great.

275
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:09,675
(eerie music)
(water dripping)

276
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,485
(rasping)

277
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,104
(distant groan)

278
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:47,479
What the...

279
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,395
(hiss)

280
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,410
(soft rattle)

281
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:34,126
(soft rattle)

282
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:42,634
(distant shriek)

283
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,572
Where's it coming from?

284
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,099
(water drips)

285
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:23,008
(distant scraping)

286
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,130
(water spraying)

287
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,068
(groaning)

288
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:11,223
(water dripping)

289
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:19,098
(distant scraping)

290
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:35,147
(distant scraping)

291
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,920
(soft rattle)

292
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,228
(soft rattle)

293
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,369
(soft rattle)

294
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,576
(gasp)

295
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,044
Who are you?

296
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,280
(clapping)

297
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,682
- Clapper.

298
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,184
- What?

299
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,586
- I got the lights
 rigged to a Clapper.

300
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,155
Clap twice, they go on.

301
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,091
Clap twice, and they go off.

302
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,993
- What are you doing here?

303
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,160
- I live here.

304
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,798
You must be Clark.

305
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,035
- How, how do you know my name?

306
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:32,004
- The elevator shaft.

307
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,139
You listen close, and you can
 hear what people are saying

308
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,309
in some of the
hallways and the rooms.

309
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:42,147
- You're not supposed to
 be here without permission.

310
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,782
- Whose permission?

311
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:44,917
- Our permission, the permission

312
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,519
of the people who live here.

313
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,955
- Who gave them permission?

314
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,124
Who gave you permission?

315
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,259
- I was here before any of you.

316
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,661
- And you've been down
 here this whole time

317
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,829
and nobody ever found you?

318
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,999
- I'm a quiet person.

319
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,602
People don't come
 down here very often.

320
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,671
And when they do, I hide.

321
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,309
- Why didn't you hide just now?

322
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:15,480
- My motives are varied
and often obscure.

323
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,654
So why are you here?

324
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,223
- How do you mean?

325
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,858
I'm in the basement
because I smelled smoke.

326
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,360
Somebody's been messing
around up there.

327
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,928
There were these
 marks on the ground

328
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:32,864
and the center part was burning.

329
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:35,400
I don't suppose you
know anything about it.

330
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,470
- That means you do suppose
 I know something about it.

331
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,304
- Do you?

332
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:44,309
- I didn't do it, if
  that's what you're asking.

333
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,979
- Well, I'm in this building
 because I can't afford

334
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,181
any place else to live.

335
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,750
I'm at the university
 because I want to study math.

336
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,420
As to why I'm here on
 earth, to learn maybe.

337
00:20:57,122 --> 00:21:00,425
- So you're here on
 earth to learn, huh?

338
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:02,861
- I suppose.

339
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,630
Good a reason as any.

340
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,934
- You know what my
 father used to say?

341
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:13,038
He said that fear is the
place you go to learn.

342
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,940
- I don't believe that.

343
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:20,712
- I didn't for a long time
 either, but I'm starting to.

344
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,515
I think what he meant
 to say is that fear

345
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:27,686
is the place where you go
  to learn about yourself.

346
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,391
- [Clark] What's this?

347
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,327
- Actually, I'm not 100% sure.

348
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,898
Somebody did this
  when I was out.

349
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,967
And I do go out you know.

350
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,870
I think it's some
 sort of an experiment,

351
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,905
not a completely successful one.

352
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:49,074
- What kind of experiment?

353
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,676
These are just like
 the ones in the alley

354
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:53,478
and the center part was burning.

355
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,280
- Just like it?

356
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,415
- No.

357
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:57,382
These are smaller.

358
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,384
What kind of experiment?

359
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,421
- You see these marks?

360
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,623
They're apostolic symbols,

361
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,559
an old ancient script from
  around the first century.

362
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:11,763
- So this is some sort
 of an occult thing?

363
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:15,500
- Nobody's ever been able
  to translate them before.

364
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,869
They say that that's
 because these symbols

365
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:21,707
aren't a language at all, but
 they're actually equations.

366
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,308
- That's an interesting
coincidence.

367
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,444
Somebody just happens to
  put these things down here

368
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,446
and you just happen to
 know everything about them,

369
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,015
but you didn't do it.

370
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,250
- I'm a collector of facts.

371
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,586
Facts are overrated, of course,

372
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:39,257
just raw material until you
 organize them into theories.

373
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:41,526
These aren't the first
  ones that I've found here.

374
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,696
There's a few other
 on the far wall there.

375
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:48,233
But this is the first
 one that resulted in a

376
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,067
ignition.

377
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,204
- But what's it for?

378
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,741
- It may be some kind
 of lightning rod,

379
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,275
or somebody wants it to be.

380
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,378
- What kind of lightning?

381
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,650
What are these?

382
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,787
- Texts of apostolic symbols.

383
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:11,723
Also some notes that I wrote.

384
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,891
I've been trying to decode them,

385
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,227
but I haven't had much luck.

386
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:23,068
Did anyone ever tell
you about the Shrieker?

387
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:29,441
Someone has been messing
 around with some arcane stuff,

388
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:30,675
which normally wouldn't matter

389
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:33,411
because 99% of the
 occult is bullshit,

390
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:34,546
and none of the
  people studying it

391
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,114
are smart enough to recognize,

392
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:40,218
never mind figure out
 the 1% that isn't.

393
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:42,053
Somebody in this place

394
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,825
has stumbled onto something.

395
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:50,495
They're experimenting,
  and they're getting close.

396
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:52,430
- To drawing lightning?

397
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,172
- Find out about the Shrieker.

398
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,607
- [Clark] What's the Shrieker?

399
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,113
- What you need to know you
 can find out in the library.

400
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:12,484
- Under what, occult
 studies, mythology, folklore?

401
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,219
- Local history.

402
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:18,123
- Local, you mean the
 town, the university?

403
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,959
- I'm talking about
 this building.

404
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:28,066
- I won't tell anybody you're
 here if you don't want me to.

405
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:29,901
- I don't.

406
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:32,704
Thanks.

407
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,010
Hey.

408
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:44,149
You should do something
about that cut.

409
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,250
On your back.

410
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:47,118
- Oh.

411
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,054
Thanks.

412
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:56,228
So, um, what's the average
  yearly rainfall in Athens?

413
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,564
(soft chuckle)

414
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:02,033
- 15.8 inches a year.

415
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,535
- What about Lima?

416
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:05,737
- 1.6.

417
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,208
(laughing)

418
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,278
- [Zak] Jesus Christ.

419
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:14,513
You could have been
 killed down there.

420
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,647
- Hm?

421
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:16,481
Okay.

422
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:18,450
- Is it serious?

423
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,284
- No.

424
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:23,922
- What are you looking up?

425
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,458
- Average yearly rainfall.

426
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,525
Athens, 15.8.

427
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:29,661
Lima, 1.6.

428
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:33,131
Damn.

429
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,001
- Is this a problem?

430
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:36,835
- Hm?

431
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,472
- Well, the burn in the
alley's definitely cold.

432
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,541
- Yeah, I'm gonna install
  some smoke detectors

433
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,609
down there just to
 be on the safe side.

434
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:47,145
You guys'll buy 'em,
 and I'll install 'em.

435
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:48,513
- All right, listen up.

436
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:50,949
I've chained up the door
down to the basement.

437
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,951
Whichever one of you was
fucking around in there

438
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:55,787
with that voodoo
 bullshit in the alley,

439
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,489
there better not be a repeat,

440
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,791
or somebody's gonna get
 their ass kicked out of here.

441
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,960
- David, maybe it
  wasn't one of us.

442
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,663
Maybe it was someone else,
  someone from the outside.

443
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,398
- There isn't any other
way into the compound

444
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,800
without the keys, unless
somebody around here

445
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,603
gave copies to somebody.

446
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,505
So it's one of us.

447
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,307
I'm not gonna make some
kind of issue out of it.

448
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:17,575
Far be it from me to
  point the finger of guilt.

449
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:18,410
This time.

450
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:21,746
- Feel better.

451
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:22,581
- Thanks.

452
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,318
(Mike sighs)

453
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,187
- Last booster shot?

454
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:30,021
- Uh...

455
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,190
Six months ago.

456
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,093
- Okay.

457
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:36,995
Done.

458
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:38,263
- Thanks.

459
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,397
- Do you want any painkillers?

460
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:40,799
- No, I'm all right.

461
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,766
- [Elaine] Bye.

462
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,001
- Bye.

463
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:46,338
(staticky grunge music)

464
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:50,675
He thinks I did it.

465
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:51,509
- Hm?

466
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:52,777
- David.

467
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,246
He thinks I did that
 thing in the alley.

468
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:56,281
- Well, he's got no reason.

469
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,215
You can just--

470
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:59,017
- No, it makes perfect sense.

471
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:02,120
I mean, I'm new here and
 none of you really know me,

472
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,455
and I was there.

473
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,890
But I didn't do it.

474
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,326
- I believe you.

475
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,463
Well, I better go too.

476
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,131
- No, no, you don't,

477
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,866
you don't have to go.

478
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,906
Do you, um, do you
  believe that fear

479
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:24,976
is the place that
  you go to learn?

480
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,579
I mean, when you
 confront your fear,

481
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:31,416
do you think that you
can turn it into wisdom?

482
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:36,688
- I'd love to be able to
respond appropriately,

483
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,857
but I've got to be honest.

484
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:41,159
I'm clueless.

485
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:58,710
Appropriate response. (laughs)

486
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,651
(dial-up beeping)

487
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:27,739
(beep)

488
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:31,843
(screech)
(ominous music)

489
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:49,994
- The Shrieker.

490
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:58,870
(haunting choral music)
(keystrokes)

491
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:22,727
No, you're all wrong.

492
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:29,067
(crickets chirp)

493
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,405
(distant groans)

494
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,183
(roar)

495
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,919
(dramatic music)

496
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,157
(hiss)

497
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,494
- I think the
 building's on fire.

498
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:59,497
- [Tanya] Can we
 turn on the lights?

499
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:02,233
(clank)

500
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,469
(coughing)

501
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,642
- [Clark] Who the hell did this?

502
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:15,280
- [Zak] All right, let's
search the compound.

503
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,283
(suspenseful music)

504
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,439
(Elaine gasps)

505
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,207
- Chain's still
  on the front gate.

506
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,743
(exerted breathing)

507
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,345
Gate's still locked.

508
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:21,379
- Big surprise.

509
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,047
- What's that supposed to mean?

510
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,315
- I don't know what kind
of Halloween bullshit

511
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,484
you're pulling here, but
I want you out of here.

512
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:28,486
- Hey, who the hell
 put you in charge?

513
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:29,320
- I was here first.

514
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,154
I found this place.

515
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:31,089
I staked it out.

516
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,590
I'm trying to preserve it.

517
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,725
You know Zak, you ought to
 try to think with your head

518
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,559
instead of your dick.

519
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,527
- Hey, fuck you.

520
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,396
- You think I don't
know what this is about?

521
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,566
This is like some kinda
 fucked up Scooby-Doo episode.

522
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,101
You're trying to scare us out.

523
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:45,236
Maybe you and Zak worked
  the whole thing together.

524
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,671
What's the matter, you want
 the whole fucking hospital

525
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:47,505
for yourselves?

526
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:48,706
- Fine, I'll leave.

527
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,008
I'll find someplace
 else to stay.

528
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,976
- No, no, you don't
 have to go anywhere.

529
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,911
David is not the
 landlord around here.

530
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:55,880
He is just a squatter
 like the rest of us.

531
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,383
You don't give anybody orders!

532
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,985
- Yeah, well you can get
 out too, Miss Daily Worker.

533
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,487
You know something,
 comrade Tanya?

534
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,555
You want to go help the
workers, go fuck one.

535
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:05,757
- All right, come
 on, come on, come on.

536
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,791
- What's the title
 on your party anyway?

537
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:07,759
Fag hag?

538
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,594
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

539
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,795
What's that supposed to mean?

540
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:12,130
- When was the last
time you fucked someone

541
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,665
without the express
 intention of trying

542
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,600
to change his political views?

543
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,135
- Fine, I'll leave!

544
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:18,770
Anybody who does
  not wish to remain

545
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,907
in the company of this
 oppressive fuckhead
 can come with me.

546
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,512
- Didn't something like
this happen in Reds?

547
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:28,746
- All right guys, look.

548
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:30,381
If we let this turn
 into open warfare,

549
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,383
everything we've got
 going here's just
 gonna go up in smoke.

550
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:35,420
- How ironically apt an analogy.

551
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,723
I'm telling you guys,
 somebody isn't what they seem,

552
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:42,827
and unless we rid ourselves
 of that person, or persons,

553
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,062
there isn't going to be
any peace around here.

554
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,697
- What about the scream?

555
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:46,531
What made the scream?

556
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:47,465
I mean it wasn't human.

557
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,034
Doesn't this bother anybody?

558
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:51,536
- You said you're gonna go when?

559
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:52,437
- No, I changed my mind.

560
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:53,671
I'm not going anywhere.

561
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,006
I'm gonna find out
 what's going on here.

562
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,374
Unless you plan
  on kicking me out.

563
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:57,942
- No, he isn't.

564
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:58,776
- Oh really?

565
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,278
Why not?

566
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:02,080
- Because if you do I'll
  rat this whole thing out,

567
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,315
and then we'll all
  be on the street.

568
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,416
- That's great.

569
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,584
Fucking great.

570
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,187
Fucking surprise.

571
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:15,026
- Hey, is Zak around?

572
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,327
- No, it's just us.

573
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,295
- Do you need help with that?

574
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:19,030
- No thanks.

575
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,898
You know Clark, if we
 would work together,

576
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,834
we could really change some
 things around this place.

577
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,069
- Look, Tanya, I think some
 really dangerous things

578
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,604
are going on around here.

579
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,106
- Tell me about it.

580
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,942
You think I don't recognize
 the tactics of oppression?

581
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:32,677
You need to wake up, Clark.

582
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,479
The only safety is in sisterhood

583
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:37,949
united under the
 banner of communism.

584
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,183
Think about it.

585
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:42,987
(Clark sighs)

586
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:45,723
(crickets chirp)

587
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,493
(ominous music)

588
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,798
(guttural rasping)

589
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,039
(snorting)

590
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,708
(metallic thud)

591
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,183
(clanging)

592
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:46,017
- Hello?

593
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,289
(snorting)

594
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,091
Hey.

595
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:04,168
Hey.

596
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,085
(groan)

597
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:23,354
(electric buzz)

598
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:25,690
(shrieking)

599
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,604
(hiss)

600
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,412
(hiss)

601
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:57,355
(hiss)

602
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,165
(growl)

603
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:10,167
(clink)

604
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:15,840
(shriek)

605
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,545
(shriek)

606
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,950
(shrieking)

607
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:30,788
(screaming)

608
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:35,159
(distant shrieking)

609
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,129
- What is it?

610
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:40,064
- [Clark] I don't know.

611
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:43,067
(distant shrieking)

612
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,471
(moan)

613
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,176
- Where is it?

614
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:53,044
Where is it coming from?

615
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:53,878
- [Clark] I don't know.

616
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:54,712
I can't tell.

617
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:55,546
Come on.

618
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,781
- No, no.

619
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,716
- Wait, Tanya, just
 stay here and be quiet

620
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,951
and I'll go check outside.

621
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,419
- No no, stay here!

622
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,820
I mean, what are you gonna
  go do if you find it?

623
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,055
What?

624
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,824
Just, you stay here
 and just be quiet.

625
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,098
- I think it's gone.

626
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,571
- Back from Siberia?

627
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,976
(knocking)

628
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,780
- Heard any weird
  sounds tonight?

629
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,948
- No, why?

630
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,850
- (scoffs) Yeah right.

631
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,086
(knocking)

632
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:39,757
(Tanya sighs)

633
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,293
Have you seen Mike around?

634
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,428
He told me he'd turn the
power on in my building.

635
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,930
- I haven't seen him.

636
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,098
Make sure you black
 out all the windows

637
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,967
before you turn on any lights.

638
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:52,169
- Don't think I don't
know what you're doing.

639
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:54,605
(door shuts)

640
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,381
(knock)

641
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,215
- Hold on.

642
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,554
Come in.

643
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,457
- Hey, how you doing?

644
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,692
- Oh, hey.

645
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,460
- Just wondering if
 you want some company.

646
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,962
- Um, sure.

647
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:18,796
Come in.

648
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:26,037
- So, what are you working on?

649
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,405
- This, oh.

650
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:30,474
Well actually it's
 multidimensional topography.

651
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,677
You see, it can describe a
 fourth dimensional object by--

652
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,312
- Please stop, oh.

653
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,780
I'm sorry.

654
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,614
It's just

655
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,816
not my area.

656
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,650
- Okay.

657
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:41,752
- Look, I just want you to know

658
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,788
that whatever's
 going on around here,

659
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,890
I think David is
way out of line.

660
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:46,991
- Thanks.

661
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:50,227
(phone rings)

662
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:51,529
Hello?

663
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:52,697
- It's Robert.

664
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:55,132
- [Clark] Oh, hi.

665
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,001
- [Robert] I've been hearing
 some weird noises lately.

666
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,336
Last night and
 again this evening.

667
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:00,905
Was I dreaming?

668
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,573
- No, you weren't.

669
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,408
- Well I guess the
  latest experiments

670
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,944
were more successful
than the previous ones.

671
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:09,246
Have you had a chance to
 look at the notes I gave you?

672
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:11,248
- Yeah, I was just...

673
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:12,516
Hold on.

674
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,518
Zak, actually this
  is a private call.

675
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,352
Do you mind?

676
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:17,021
- Oh no, no.

677
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,055
Do you need these?

678
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:19,724
- Oh yeah.

679
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,125
Thanks.

680
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,460
- See you later.

681
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,469
- Okay, I've been
looking over your notes

682
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,871
and you're completely wrong.

683
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,474
- Well that's progress at least.

684
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:37,608
Why am I wrong?

685
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:39,076
- You've been
 treating these symbols

686
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,412
as if they were mathematical
 terms, but they're not.

687
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,114
- Then what are they?

688
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:44,348
- They're cross sections.

689
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:45,616
Look, can I come
  down and see you?

690
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:47,685
I have some things
 I want to show you.

691
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:48,819
- I'm here.

692
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:49,720
Come around the back.

693
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,788
It's unlocked.

694
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:51,789
- Right, right.

695
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,724
(beep)

696
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,131
- Hey.

697
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,665
- Sorry, I gotta go.

698
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:03,334
- At 11:30 at night?

699
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:04,602
- School thing.

700
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,347
See, the even symbols are
 two-dimensional cross sections

701
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:19,083
of a three-dimensional shape.

702
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,185
The odd symbols define the
  angle of a cross section.

703
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,019
Watch.

704
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:28,592
- This is what I think.

705
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:33,097
There are higher dimensions,
 and things live in them.

706
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,232
Sometimes there's weak spots
 between the higher ones

707
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:38,135
and our own where they
 can break through,

708
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:39,804
and I think sometimes
 these breakthroughs

709
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,673
must happen spontaneously.

710
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:43,841
Not often but,

711
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,011
there have been other cases.

712
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:48,245
- Like lightning.

713
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:50,114
- That's right.

714
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,616
And if you wanted to draw
  lightning on purpose,

715
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,218
where would you go?

716
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:59,457
Someplace you knew lightning
 had already struck on its own.

717
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,025
- Maybe.

718
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,793
But you wouldn't just
 go on a mountainside

719
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,462
holding a lightning
 rod, would you?

720
00:41:05,462 --> 00:41:08,032
Whoever's doing this
  knows about the Shrieker.

721
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:08,966
They know what it did.

722
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,501
They wouldn't just conjure it up

723
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,603
unless they had a death wish.

724
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:16,774
- Not unless you had some
  means of controlling it,

725
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:17,875
directing it.

726
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:24,148
- You know, just listening
 to it, I'm scared to death.

727
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,350
- Did you learn anything?

728
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,853
- No, I was too
 petrified to think.

729
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:32,356
- The problem was that
 you didn't go to it.

730
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:33,524
You didn't face it.

731
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:34,758
That's why you didn't
 learn anything.

732
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:36,093
- Okay, I have to
 be honest with you.

733
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:40,097
That sounds like a monumentally
bad piece of advice.

734
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:44,602
- Sometimes lies are more
  agreeable than the truth.

735
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,504
Which do you prefer?

736
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,504
- The truth.

737
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,418
- What do you make of those?

738
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:02,653
- Nothing yet.

739
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:05,256
They're different
  than the others.

740
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,392
- The mark of sending.

741
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:10,861
You use this symbol to kill.

742
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,062
Draw it on a piece of paper

743
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:14,198
and hand it to a
 prospective victim.

744
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,033
Once they've received it,
 they can only get rid of it

745
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,202
by giving it to somebody else.

746
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:21,705
Tearing it up and throwing
  it away won't work.

747
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,607
The mark of binding.

748
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:26,644
Once you have derived
 or invoked the demon,

749
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:31,548
this symbol, this shape,
 makes it your slave in theory,

750
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:34,818
but that symbol only works
  after you've given it to

751
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:36,453
five victims.

752
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:39,290
- You knew what these
symbols meant all along?

753
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,158
Those notes you gave
me, they were bullshit.

754
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:42,326
You knew what these meant.

755
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:43,193
- Do you believe in it?

756
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:44,028
- What?

757
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:44,995
- Do you believe in it?

758
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:46,130
- What?
  - Say it.

759
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,800
Tell me that you
believe that it's real.

760
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,403
- I believe that it's real.

761
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,538
- I think Mike is dead.

762
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:56,874
He was the first victim and
 four other are gonna die too

763
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,642
if this thing isn't stopped.

764
00:42:58,642 --> 00:42:59,877
And to be honest with you,

765
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:02,446
I don't think this
 thing can be stopped.

766
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:05,783
You've got a decision
 to make here.

767
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:09,720
That door over there,
it leads to the outside.

768
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,990
You can go and you
don't have to come back.

769
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,992
- What about the others?

770
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:19,196
- They won't believe you.

771
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:22,766
And they're certainly
 not gonna believe me.

772
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,403
- God Zak, I've
 got to talk to you.

773
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:28,372
- We wanted to
 talk to you, Clark.

774
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:29,406
- We?

775
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:30,240
- Come on.

776
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:41,151
- Have a seat, Clark.

777
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:43,821
- To what do I owe the pleasure?

778
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,691
That was in my room.

779
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:49,727
- Well now it's in here.

780
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:50,928
- You had no right.

781
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:53,430
- We all have the right
to self-protection.

782
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,866
- Look, I was gonna tell
you about this, okay?

783
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:57,301
I didn't do those drawings.

784
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,069
I got them from Robert.

785
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:00,270
- Who's Robert?

786
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,338
- Robert lives in the basement.

787
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:02,206
He's been down there--

788
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:03,407
- Bullshit.

789
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:04,875
There isn't anybody
 in the basement.

790
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,677
I've been down there 20 times.

791
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:08,145
- Oh really?

792
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,513
And what were you doing
 down there all those times?

793
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:10,748
- No no.

794
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:12,216
Don't you try to
  turn this around.

795
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:14,084
There's no bogeyman
 in the basement.

796
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,252
There's just you.

797
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:16,487
- No, I didn't.

798
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,721
Zak?

799
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:18,756
- You were hiding this
 stuff in your room.

800
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:20,124
What do you want me to think?

801
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:21,191
- I wasn't hiding.

802
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:22,426
- Yes you were.

803
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:23,227
I saw the way you
 closed that notebook

804
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:24,028
when I came in the room.

805
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:25,262
Don't tell me that.

806
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:26,530
- Look Zak, you've
  gotta trust me.

807
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:27,798
- No.

808
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,767
You don't have the right
to use me and lie to me

809
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:32,369
and then ask me to trust you.

810
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:35,239
- Okay, I'm sorry I didn't
 tell you about the drawings,

811
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:37,241
but I never used you.

812
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:38,909
- How can I believe you?

813
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:41,745
- I don't know how, but
you've gotta try, okay?

814
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:43,881
Look, I think we're all
in real danger here.

815
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:46,417
Honest to God, I
 think Mike is dead.

816
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:47,351
- Why?

817
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,186
Because he hasn't come home?

818
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,387
You know, he wasn't
 lying you know.

819
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:51,789
He really does have
 two girlfriends

820
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:53,757
and this whole gender
thing he's always gotta

821
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:58,529
constantly prove, him not
 being here isn't so unusual.

822
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,365
- 50 years ago
something happened here.

823
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,667
Seven people were
 killed by something.

824
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,269
- Yeah, probably by
 poor medical care.

825
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:07,604
- Christ, don't you think I
know how ridiculous this sounds?

826
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:09,206
- Good, then we're in
agreement on something.

827
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,341
- Don't you see I'm
 trying to warn you?

828
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:13,410
I'm trying to save your lives.

829
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,812
- Go on, Clark.

830
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:16,180
You want to tell us something,
 go ahead and tell us.

831
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,148
- It isn't a joke.

832
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:19,883
The newspapers reported it.

833
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,152
They called it the Shrieker,

834
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:24,288
and I believe that it came
  through here last night,

835
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:25,956
right through that door.

836
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:27,725
- Then why didn't
  anybody see it?

837
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,093
- I don't know.

838
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:32,129
It may be able to
 make itself invisible

839
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,998
or move through solid matter.

840
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:37,401
- Well that would explain it.

841
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:41,271
(water dripping)

842
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:13,837
- And this Robert, he
  told you about these, uh--

843
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:15,439
- Apostolic symbols.

844
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,406
- And you believed him.

845
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:17,941
- Yes.

846
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,110
- Did you ever think he's
  the one who's doing this?

847
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,411
- There's no way.

848
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:23,046
With the first floor
 door locked off,

849
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:24,815
the only way out of the basement

850
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:26,750
is through a door
  to the outside,

851
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,552
and the only way back
 in and up the stairs

852
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:31,021
is through a side entrance
  that's been chained shut.

853
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:31,955
- This is ridiculous.

854
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,790
Who even says there is a Robert?

855
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,260
- Well hell, that's
 easy enough to test.

856
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,595
Either he's there or he isn't.

857
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:39,863
Why don't we go check?

858
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:40,764
Prove that much of
  the story anyway.

859
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:41,598
- That's fine by me.

860
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:42,432
Let's go.

861
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:45,035
(bestial roar)

862
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:47,538
Okay, fuck this.

863
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:53,911
(click)

864
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:54,745
- Hey man--

865
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:55,979
- Hey yourself.

866
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,214
What are you do when
 you're a squatter

867
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:58,015
and someone breaks
 in, call the police?

868
00:46:58,015 --> 00:46:58,816
Home defense, man.

869
00:46:58,816 --> 00:46:59,917
We're urban pioneers.

870
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,351
- So I guess it's not Clark.

871
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:02,786
- Maybe it's Clark.

872
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:04,621
I'll take it further, maybe
 it's Clark and Robert.

873
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:08,559
(roar)
(clang)

874
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:12,129
Okay, let's go.

875
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,403
(hiss)

876
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:25,008
(bestial roar)

877
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:30,581
(dialing)

878
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:34,918
(phone rings)
 (gasping)

879
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,186
Hello?

880
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,121
- Look David, you
  fascist fuckhead.

881
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:39,456
I know what you're doing.

882
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:40,791
- What am I doing, Tanya?

883
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:42,559
- Knock of the noise.

884
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,094
- Guess again, Tanya.

885
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:45,529
We found the incriminating
  evidence in Clark's room.

886
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,463
- Bullshit.

887
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,131
- Hey, hurrah for solidarity.

888
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:49,800
We're kinda busy here.

889
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,735
(beep)

890
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:54,671
All right, you say
  there's a Robert.

891
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,073
Let's go find him.

892
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:57,307
- Well maybe we should split up.

893
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:58,842
- Is that supposed to be funny?

894
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:00,978
Let's go, everybody!

895
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:03,981
(suspenseful music)

896
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,766
(roar)

897
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:23,834
(electrical buzz)

898
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:26,136
(screeching)

899
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:28,905
(distant shriek)

900
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:49,393
(distant growl)

901
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:59,736
(distant growl)

902
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:08,312
(screech)

903
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,655
(crashing)
 (bestial roar)

904
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:21,425
(dramatic music)

905
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:25,329
(exerted breathing)

906
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,430
Shit!

907
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:27,664
- Is that the right key?

908
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:29,199
- Let's see.

909
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:32,369
It has a piece of tape on
  it that says facility two.

910
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:33,704
Shit shit.

911
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:34,538
- What?

912
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:35,472
- What?

913
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:36,473
- It's not the same lock.

914
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,208
Somebody replaced it.

915
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:40,911
Man, this is really fucked up.

916
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:42,379
- What, it doesn't work?

917
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:43,880
- Well duh, yes Zak.

918
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:44,748
It's not the same lock.

919
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:45,982
It's brand new.

920
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:47,584
And don't tell me some
thing from another world

921
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:49,586
went to the Sandals
 Hardware Store.

922
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:51,154
- It needs four more victims.

923
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,055
There's five of us.

924
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:53,223
- There's six.

925
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:54,324
- Mike's dead.

926
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,225
- I'm talking about Robert.

927
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:58,261
(phone rings)

928
00:49:58,261 --> 00:49:59,129
- What!

929
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:00,497
- Knock it off.

930
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:01,465
- Knock what off?

931
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:03,200
- Whoever is out in the hall,

932
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,669
you better tell them
 to get the fuck out.

933
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:08,839
- I hate to break this to you
 Tanya, but we're all out here.

934
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:12,209
- Look David, this is
 not funny, all right?

935
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:13,143
- You're doing this, aren't you?

936
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:14,077
- What?

937
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:15,278
- You've got tape recorders.

938
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:16,747
You're orchestrating
the whole goddamn thing.

939
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:18,248
What's the plan, a little
  purge of the compound?

940
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:21,084
(roaring)

941
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:22,085
(screech)

942
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:23,754
- Something is in the room.

943
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:24,654
- Maybe it's the ghost of Lenin.

944
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:25,489
- God, give me that!

945
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:27,391
Tanya, can you hear me?

946
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:29,092
Did you find a square of paper?

947
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:31,261
(shrieking)

948
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:32,095
- What?

949
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:33,530
What do you mean?

950
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,133
- Did you find a piece of
paper with some markings on it?

951
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,868
- (stammers) I don't understand.

952
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,604
(roaring shriek)

953
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:47,644
What the fuck?

954
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,618
(shriek)

955
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:57,921
- What, what's happening?

956
00:50:57,921 --> 00:50:59,156
- I don't know.

957
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:04,795
(thud)

958
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:06,329
(snorting)

959
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,398
(shriek)

960
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:11,101
(Tanya screams)

961
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:11,935
Oh Jesus!

962
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:14,237
(Elaine shouts)

963
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,939
You've got to get it to work!

964
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:16,773
Tanya!

965
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:23,547
(snort)

966
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:25,282
Something's in there.

967
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,185
- No no.

968
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:29,119
Hey, you want to
 pull that pistol out,

969
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,921
now would be a pretty good time.

970
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,622
- Okay, okay.

971
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:33,457
- Come on.

972
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:51,208
(water drips)
(haunting ambient music)

973
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:07,824
(hiss)

974
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:12,963
(eerie echoes)

975
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:23,840
(low growl in distance)

976
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:35,886
(dramatic music)

977
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:41,424
(hissing and screeching)

978
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:46,263
(shouting)

979
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:50,600
(roaring and shrieking)

980
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:55,171
(bestial moan)

981
00:52:59,009 --> 00:52:59,976
(roar)
  - Hold up.

982
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:01,945
- Where is it coming from?

983
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:03,380
- Okay, let's go.

984
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:12,522
(shrieking)

985
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:13,657
How did it get in front of us?

986
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,158
- The three-dimensional
cross section.

987
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:16,660
- So?

988
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:17,861
- So it can move instantly
 from one place to the next,

989
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,930
even move through walls.

990
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,331
- That's fucking great.

991
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:22,165
- It has to be solid to kill us.

992
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:23,366
- Yes.

993
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,435
- Okay then, when
 it's solid we kill it.

994
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:26,303
- Where's my fuckin' phone.

995
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:27,571
- Who are you calling?

996
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:29,506
- Who do you think,
 National Enquirer?

997
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:30,473
911.

998
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:31,474
- Well, tell them it's a maniac.

999
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:32,442
Don't tell them it's a monster.

1000
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:33,777
They'll never believe you.

1001
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:35,612
- Thanks for the hint.

1002
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,914
Hello? Hello?

1003
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:39,082
(shrieking over phone)

1004
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:40,016
Shit!

1005
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:42,085
It's in the fucking phone!

1006
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,422
(gunshot)

1007
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:47,223
(soft gasp)

1008
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:49,993
(dramatic music)

1009
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:51,861
- [Clark] Robert!

1010
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:53,897
- What the fuck?

1011
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:54,731
- Clark!

1012
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,234
- [Clark] Oh...

1013
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:02,005
- [Elaine] Don't bother.

1014
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:03,240
- Oh my God.

1015
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,474
- Can't you give him
 CPR or something?

1016
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:05,208
- He's been shot
  through the heart.

1017
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:06,042
He's dead.

1018
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:08,778
- Way to go, David.

1019
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:10,247
One guy in the whole
 world who knows

1020
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:14,384
what's going on around here,
 and you just killed him.

1021
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:18,321
- Aren't you gonna cover
him up or something?

1022
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:19,155
- Why?

1023
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:22,626
(click)

1024
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:25,228
- I don't suppose you have
 any more bullets for this gun?

1025
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:26,396
- No, I don't.

1026
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,999
- Well shit.

1027
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:30,634
When that thing comes
walkin' through a wall,

1028
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:33,069
maybe we can throw it at it.

1029
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,571
- Why isn't it coming after us?

1030
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:35,872
Why doesn't it
 just come after us?

1031
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:38,808
- Somebody here knows why.

1032
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:39,743
It's killed twice.

1033
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:41,645
It'll kill three more times.

1034
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:43,446
Three of us have
 been given the mark,

1035
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,483
a square piece of paper with
 a symbol inscribed on it.

1036
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:47,984
That's what draws it.

1037
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:49,653
Once you've been given
 the mark, the only way

1038
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:52,422
to get rid of it is to
  give it to somebody else.

1039
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:54,591
It kills whoever's
 been given the mark.

1040
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:56,860
That's the price for binding it.

1041
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:00,263
Mike, Tanya, and three
 of us, five lives.

1042
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,235
That leaves one
 person left standing,

1043
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:06,770
the one person who's
been doing all of this,

1044
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,938
and I know it isn't me.

1045
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:11,074
That means it's one of you.

1046
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:14,144
As far as I'm concerned,
 it could be any one of you.

1047
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,379
- (scoffs) Well I
  know it's not me.

1048
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:17,881
- I'm not so sure.

1049
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:21,184
You were here first.

1050
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:23,720
You waited until five
other people were here.

1051
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,722
In the other building, when
 you had to shoot that thing,

1052
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:26,990
your aim wasn't so good

1053
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,925
but you didn't have any
problem hitting Robert.

1054
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:29,759
Why is that?

1055
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:30,994
- Screw you, all right.

1056
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,228
You're the one who
  brought her in.

1057
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:34,197
Maybe you needed to
 finish the collection.

1058
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:36,232
History major, how about that.

1059
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:38,334
Who better set up to learn
 about all this arcane shit?

1060
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:39,569
- Christ, knock it off!

1061
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:41,337
- The marks, we should
 look for the marks.

1062
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:42,839
- What?

1063
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:43,773
- If you've been given one
  of those piece of paper,

1064
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:45,075
then you're not the one, right?

1065
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:46,009
- Right.

1066
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,544
- But it might not be on you.

1067
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:50,046
It could have been passed
  along in a book, anything.

1068
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:52,449
It doesn't have to be on you.

1069
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:56,119
- Jesus.

1070
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:01,291
What is this?

1071
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:02,192
Is this it?

1072
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,897
This is it.

1073
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:09,632
Who did this?

1074
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:11,801
Who put this in my wallet?

1075
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:13,770
Great.

1076
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:15,638
Great.

1077
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:17,407
Great.

1078
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,341
- It's not on me.

1079
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:20,910
I'm gonna go search my room.

1080
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:24,748
- Clark, (stammers)
 how do we know if...

1081
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:25,648
Fine, fine.

1082
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,885
You want to hear.

1083
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:29,986
You think I'm gonna
 come over there

1084
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:32,789
and force you to take it?

1085
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:34,858
Fine, keep your distance.

1086
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:35,825
Stay away from me.

1087
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:37,026
Go to your room.

1088
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:39,229
All of you can
  stay away from me.

1089
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,363
I found mine.

1090
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:41,631
You find yours!

1091
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:53,143
(bestial shrieking)

1092
00:56:57,113 --> 00:56:58,581
(growl)

1093
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,483
(moan)

1094
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:05,522
(snorting breaths)

1095
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:08,158
(high-pitched shriek)

1096
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:10,660
(water drips)

1097
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:14,497
(shriek)

1098
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,504
(electric buzz)

1099
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:23,606
(shriek)

1100
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:27,310
(echoing moan)

1101
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:35,618
(hiss)

1102
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:45,428
(hiss)

1103
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:56,472
(hiss)

1104
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:14,090
(snarl)
No!

1105
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:18,261
(shrieking)
 (screaming)

1106
00:58:21,497 --> 00:58:23,433
(roar)

1107
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:27,003
(David screams)

1108
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,575
- Oh my God, David.

1109
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:35,345
(thwack)
  - Zak, no!

1110
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,846
Zak!
- Use your head.

1111
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,081
If it's not you and it's
  not me, it's gotta be her.

1112
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:40,817
Haven't you noticed
 everyone else is dead?

1113
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:42,619
We'll make her tell us how
  to get rid of that thing.

1114
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:44,654
If worse comes to worst,
we'll make her tell us

1115
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:45,989
where those damn marks are.

1116
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:47,457
We'll force her
  to take them back.

1117
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:51,628
We'll shove them down
  her throat if we have to!

1118
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:52,462
Whoa, hey.

1119
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:55,698
What?

1120
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:56,799
You think it's me?

1121
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:57,800
Is that it?

1122
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,668
Oh Christ, that's great.

1123
00:58:58,668 --> 00:58:59,602
That's just great.

1124
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:01,037
You think I'm doing this.

1125
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,405
Why don't you use that?

1126
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:03,539
- I'm not sure.

1127
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:05,141
- You better get sure.

1128
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:06,643
Stay here, watch her.

1129
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:09,445
I'm gonna go find that mark
 while we still have some time.

1130
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:10,280
Watch her!

1131
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:15,585
- Clark.

1132
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,454
Where's Zak?

1133
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:20,290
- He went to his room.

1134
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:26,763
- You heard the Shrieker, right?

1135
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:27,864
It went around the
  stairs with Tanya.

1136
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:29,165
You heard him.

1137
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:30,400
- Yeah.

1138
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,135
- That's when it
  was killing Mike.

1139
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:33,503
- I guess.

1140
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,238
- Who else?

1141
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:39,442
Who else was in the
 damn building Clark,
 that's still alive?

1142
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:42,178
(dramatic music)

1143
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:57,627
- What is this?

1144
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:12,842
(distant growl)

1145
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:13,676
- Stop!

1146
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,314
- Shit.

1147
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:22,652
- Well in case you're wondering,

1148
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,290
these are symbols of
 power, protection.

1149
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:31,894
As long as you have these on,

1150
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:34,464
the Shrieker will leave you
 alone and can't hurt you.

1151
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,133
It's sort of like a vaccination.

1152
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:41,537
Oh, you don't have any.

1153
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:43,506
- Christ, why are
  you doing this?

1154
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:46,009
- Why am I doing this?

1155
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:48,011
You wouldn't understand.

1156
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:53,516
It's almost time.

1157
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:56,486
These things happen
 on a schedule.

1158
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,320
- Which one?

1159
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,022
Which one of us?

1160
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:00,189
- I'm not quite sure.

1161
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:02,492
(shriek)

1162
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:03,626
(electric buzz)

1163
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:06,329
(shriek)

1164
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,163
It's here.

1165
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:10,633
It should be reacting by now.

1166
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:12,869
- It was you all this time?

1167
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:14,037
All this time?

1168
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:17,673
- It's hard to explain, Clark.

1169
01:01:17,673 --> 01:01:21,244
See, it's horrifying
 but thrilling, really.

1170
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:26,349
You should surrender to it.

1171
01:01:27,683 --> 01:01:29,285
Just let it happen.

1172
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:32,755
Just...

1173
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:34,624
(crackling)

1174
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:35,458
ow.

1175
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,461
What the...

1176
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:40,163
Oh God.

1177
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:41,130
(loud crackling)

1178
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:41,964
Ow!

1179
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:43,933
Oh my God.

1180
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,403
(gasp)

1181
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:50,073
(shriek)

1182
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:52,075
(crunch)
(gasp)

1183
01:01:52,075 --> 01:01:53,309
- Come on!

1184
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:57,113
(high-pitched shrieking)

1185
01:01:57,113 --> 01:01:58,081
What happens now?

1186
01:01:58,081 --> 01:01:59,282
- What?

1187
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:00,783
- Well Elaine obviously
didn't plan that,

1188
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:02,485
and she also didn't draw
  that mark on her own back.

1189
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:05,388
I'd say it came as a big
 surprise, so who set her up?

1190
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:06,589
- I don't--

1191
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:07,390
- Well let's narrow
 the field a bit.

1192
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,191
I know it wasn't me.

1193
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:08,925
Who does that leave?

1194
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:10,393
- I don't know.

1195
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:11,661
- I'm doing my best, Clark.

1196
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:12,895
God knows I'm doing my best

1197
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:15,298
with this whole
  good guy routine.

1198
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:16,799
I want to trust you.

1199
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:19,068
I'm trying to, but you keep
 giving me reasons not to.

1200
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:19,902
- Let me go.

1201
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:20,837
- No!

1202
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:22,071
I'm not gonna let you go.

1203
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,339
I'm gonna hold on
  to you so tight

1204
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:25,174
that whatever happens to
me, happens to you too.

1205
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:29,345
(thwack)
 (Zak gasps)

1206
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:33,349
(Zak groans)

1207
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:36,652
Jesus Clark.

1208
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:48,865
- Of course.

1209
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:50,633
Of course.

1210
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:52,301
- [Zak] Of course what?

1211
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:54,704
(whistling)

1212
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:56,439
- Come out, come out.

1213
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:20,863
All sorts of complications,
 but it's almost over.

1214
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:22,532
- You fucker.

1215
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:24,367
- Back a pace.

1216
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:26,936
Just who the hell do
 you think you are?

1217
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:28,471
Norman?

1218
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,840
Is that you, Norman?

1219
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,775
In case you're wondering,
  there are real bullets

1220
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:35,578
in this one, not like the
  one that Elaine loaded

1221
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:37,213
into David's gun.

1222
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:38,114
- Robert...

1223
01:03:39,615 --> 01:03:41,117
- Clark, in a couple of minutes

1224
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:43,319
the Shrieker's
 gonna be coming out.

1225
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:47,490
Now it can take one of you,
 him, or the both of you.

1226
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:50,927
- What are you talking about?

1227
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:55,231
- Well, I hadn't originally
 planned on killing Elaine,

1228
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:58,401
but it became clear to me that
 her motives were conflicted.

1229
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:00,336
She wasn't serious.

1230
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:02,705
If she had been, she
 would have realized

1231
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:04,006
that the symbols of protection

1232
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,776
that I drew on her were phony.

1233
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:08,044
Not like these.

1234
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:10,479
These are real.

1235
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:16,252
Remember Clark, I
  gave you a choice.

1236
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:19,322
Don't ever say I didn't.

1237
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:22,124
I said you could leave,
but you decided to stay.

1238
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:23,859
- I wanted to help the others.

1239
01:04:23,859 --> 01:04:26,395
- Well now, that
 obviously didn't work,

1240
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:28,197
and I don't believe it.

1241
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:31,033
I think you stayed because
  you wanted to learn.

1242
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:34,704
You wanted to test your
soul in the furnace.

1243
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:40,610
There's wisdom to be
found here, dark wisdom.

1244
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:44,213
I'll teach you.

1245
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:45,114
I'll show you.

1246
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:47,049
(roar)

1247
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:52,021
(high-pitched shrieking)

1248
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:55,725
Well now, that must
 be the Shrieker.

1249
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:59,028
Clark, you might
 want to stand back.

1250
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:03,132
It won't hurt you, not yet, but
it could get a little messy.

1251
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:09,772
Clark, you are rapidly
 approaching a moment of truth.

1252
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:13,609
You can't save him, but
you can save yourself!

1253
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:17,213
I think it's a good idea, Clark.

1254
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:20,816
Zak, give me the mark.

1255
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:21,651
- [Zak] What?

1256
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:22,485
- Give me the mark.

1257
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:23,686
- No!

1258
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:24,654
- Trust me.

1259
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:26,155
- What are you doing?

1260
01:05:26,155 --> 01:05:29,759
(snorting breaths)

1261
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:33,195
I am very disappointed
 in you, Clark.

1262
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:35,865
I think we have a lot in common.

1263
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,801
What the hell are you doing?

1264
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:41,170
- Fear is the place that
you go to learn, right?

1265
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:42,071
Right?

1266
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:43,739
(low growl)

1267
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:46,208
I'll show you what it taught me.

1268
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:47,810
- Wait!

1269
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:49,812
(roaring)
  (buzzing)

1270
01:05:49,812 --> 01:05:51,447
What are you doing?

1271
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:52,982
What are you doing?

1272
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:55,318
(shrieking)

1273
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:00,790
(gunshot)

1274
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:05,594
(shriek)
(roar)

1275
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:08,264
(electric buzz)

1276
01:06:11,967 --> 01:06:15,705
(snarl)
(buzz)

1277
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:16,806
- Is that it?

1278
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:20,943
- I think so.

1279
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:24,814
- Why do I have the
feeling either we should

1280
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,282
still be trying
  to kill something,

1281
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:29,985
or something should still
  be trying to kill us?

1282
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:34,824
I guess not.

1283
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:37,526
(soft laughter)

1284
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:38,527
- Come on.

1285
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:40,963
I'll get you to the hospital.

1286
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:43,532
- Thanks.

1287
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:44,367
Oh, wait.

1288
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:49,972
We'll need this to
 shoot the lock off.

1289
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:53,242
Somebody's gotta
 think of these things.

1290
01:07:00,616 --> 01:07:03,352
(crickets chirp)

1291
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,122
You know I've been thinking.

1292
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:07,656
- About what?

1293
01:07:07,656 --> 01:07:09,592
- Sleeping in the park.

1294
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:14,163
It's not that bad when
 you think about it.

1295
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:18,300
What'd you ever see
 in that guy anyway?

1296
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:21,871
(melodious haunting music)

1297
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:05,040
(dramatic symphonic music)
