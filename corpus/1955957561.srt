2
00:01:12,429 --> 00:01:14,532
All right...

3
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,637
You're the Sprite, right?
Okay.

4
00:01:21,038 --> 00:01:22,874
Um... okay.

5
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:28,010
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, cabin
crew, please remain seated.</i>

6
00:01:28,012 --> 00:01:30,712
Looks like we got a ways before
we break through this thing.

7
00:01:30,714 --> 00:01:33,051
We're gonna have some
rough air coming up.

8
00:01:34,985 --> 00:01:37,385
<i>We're gonna leave the seatbelt
signs on for the time being.</i>

9
00:01:37,387 --> 00:01:39,787
<i>So just sit back, relax.</i>

10
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:41,989
<i>And we hope to see sunnier
skies here in a bit.</i>

11
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:43,691
<i>Hope to punch through
the storm shortly.</i>

12
00:01:43,693 --> 00:01:45,361
<i>And again, please remain seated</i>

13
00:01:45,363 --> 00:01:48,195
<i>and keep those
seatbelts fastened.</i>

14
00:01:48,197 --> 00:01:50,900
Everyone, thank you so much
for your patience.

15
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:54,572
We'll restart beverage service
once we reach clearer skies.

16
00:02:05,383 --> 00:02:07,015
Did you check the ATIS?

17
00:02:07,017 --> 00:02:08,850
I want to get a
read on the weather report.

18
00:02:08,852 --> 00:02:11,455
See when we might break
through this thing.

19
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,929
<i>In sports,
the international...</i>

20
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:33,341
Why doesn't your
dad smile in photos?

21
00:02:33,343 --> 00:02:35,677
He never has.

22
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:37,146
Yeah, but... but why?

23
00:02:37,148 --> 00:02:40,315
Oh, I don't know.
Just not his thing.

24
00:02:40,317 --> 00:02:43,452
Even in my baby photos,
he would just like hold me

25
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,754
and just be like...

26
00:02:45,756 --> 00:02:47,189
Probably something I did.

27
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:49,494
As a baby?

28
00:02:52,061 --> 00:02:55,029
Hey, Mom looks happy.

29
00:02:55,031 --> 00:02:57,464
Did they hate me?
They hated me.

30
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:58,767
They did not hate you.

31
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:00,469
That's just how they are.

32
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,571
- You're just saying that.
- No, no.

33
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:04,005
See, I love you.

34
00:03:04,007 --> 00:03:08,177
And because I love you,
they love you, too.

35
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:11,412
And even if they hate your guts,
they're still 2,600 miles away.

36
00:03:16,454 --> 00:03:19,521
- Well, Raisinet loved me.
- Mm-hmm.

37
00:03:19,523 --> 00:03:20,922
I'm sorry.
It was fun.

38
00:03:20,924 --> 00:03:22,357
Yeah?

39
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:25,027
Yeah, and this shit going
on in my brain doesn't matter.

40
00:03:25,029 --> 00:03:28,230
Thank you for asking me to come.
It was perfect.

41
00:03:28,232 --> 00:03:29,231
Yeah?

42
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:30,465
And thank you for smiling.

43
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:32,737
Yeah, my pleasure.

44
00:03:40,578 --> 00:03:41,576
Anything?

45
00:03:41,578 --> 00:03:42,810
No change.

46
00:03:42,812 --> 00:03:44,779
Looks like it's unavoidable.

47
00:03:44,781 --> 00:03:46,680
Projections are all
over the place.

48
00:03:46,682 --> 00:03:49,483
Precipitation patterns
are screaming MCC.

49
00:03:49,485 --> 00:03:51,352
But that can't be right.

50
00:03:51,354 --> 00:03:52,989
Great.

51
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,696
It's like this thing
is following us.

52
00:04:12,476 --> 00:04:13,875
It's 25A.

53
00:04:13,877 --> 00:04:15,779
And it's your turn.

54
00:04:26,357 --> 00:04:28,956
Uh...

55
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,092
Yes, sir?
What can I do for you?

56
00:04:31,094 --> 00:04:34,696
Can you please tell the pilot
to not crash the plane? Thanks.

57
00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:36,997
I assure you that
he's already considered that.

58
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:38,999
Are you on the same
flight as me?

59
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:42,004
I...
Can I get you something?

60
00:04:42,006 --> 00:04:45,172
My medicine?
It's in my bag.

61
00:04:45,174 --> 00:04:47,542
Sure.
Is it in your carry-on?

62
00:04:47,544 --> 00:04:48,776
Do you know which bin you...

63
00:04:48,778 --> 00:04:51,078
No, no.
My suitcase!

64
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,081
Oh, sir, if you checked
your luggage at the airport,

65
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,951
we can't get to it.
It's in cargo.

66
00:04:55,953 --> 00:04:59,021
No, no, no, no.
Don't you have access to that?

67
00:04:59,023 --> 00:05:01,189
I mean, what
if it's an emergency?

68
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:03,025
Sir, I'm sorry.

69
00:05:03,027 --> 00:05:06,593
I can get you a headset
or pillow, blanket.

70
00:05:06,595 --> 00:05:08,062
I can get you some water.

71
00:05:08,064 --> 00:05:09,631
How can I
relax knowing that

72
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:13,003
we could crash any minute now?

73
00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:22,477
Hey...

74
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,679
Oh!
What a little heartbreaker!

75
00:05:25,681 --> 00:05:27,814
- How old is she?
- Almost four.

76
00:05:27,816 --> 00:05:30,151
Oh, what a great age.

77
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:34,388
I wish I could see the look
on her face when she sees you.

78
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,958
I'd be happy to see
any look on her face.

79
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,561
I've been overseas deployed
for 24 months now.

80
00:05:39,563 --> 00:05:41,896
The only thing I could think
about was her and her mom.

81
00:05:41,898 --> 00:05:44,465
Are you a soldier?

82
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:45,968
Yes, ma'am.
Army Ranger.

83
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,502
So how much more time
do you have left?

84
00:05:48,504 --> 00:05:51,706
Well, I was delayed in Paris.
The only flight out was to LAX.

85
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,508
So we got five hours
to New York.

86
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,612
And then an hour car ride.
And I get to see my family.

87
00:05:57,614 --> 00:05:58,946
You're adorable.

88
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,820
- She's adorable.
- Oh, I'll say.

89
00:06:05,054 --> 00:06:06,888
They're getting restless.

90
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,790
Yeah. Well, hopefully,
we break through this

91
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:10,158
before they get
"restless" restless.

92
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,960
Well, we're about
to start service.

93
00:06:11,962 --> 00:06:13,494
So does anyone need
anything now, though?

94
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:16,163
Oh, yeah. Can you pass me one
of the blankets, please?

95
00:06:16,165 --> 00:06:18,499
Yes. Here you go.

96
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:19,802
You're too nice for this crew.

97
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:22,607
Thank you, Liam.

98
00:06:35,652 --> 00:06:36,887
Wow.

99
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:51,833
Hey.

100
00:06:51,835 --> 00:06:54,772
Don't worry.
I'm supposed to have it.

101
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:58,309
Sorry.
I wasn't worried.

102
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,381
I'm lying.
I was worried.

103
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,222
Name's Thaddeus.

104
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:15,660
U.S. Air Marshal.

105
00:07:16,693 --> 00:07:19,664
Anna.
Nice to meet you.

106
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,399
Likewise.

107
00:07:32,775 --> 00:07:34,141
Flight Deck?

108
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,511
Can I get you
guys anything?

109
00:07:36,513 --> 00:07:39,848
No, I think we're good.
Thanks, Alice.

110
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,848
Everything good back there?

111
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,550
<i>Mostly.</i>

112
00:07:42,552 --> 00:07:46,989
We had one passenger ask that
you guys not crash the plane.

113
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:48,622
Hadn't thought of that.

114
00:07:48,624 --> 00:07:50,391
<i>All right.</i>

115
00:07:50,393 --> 00:07:52,593
<i>Well, let me know if you guys
need something. Just ring.</i>

116
00:07:52,595 --> 00:07:54,064
We will. Thanks.

117
00:07:57,734 --> 00:07:59,167
Everything all
right back there?

118
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:01,537
Yeah, yeah.
Seems good.

119
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:03,874
Alice was just checking in.

120
00:08:06,242 --> 00:08:07,943
It would have been nice if
JFK had given us

121
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,811
a heads up on this storm
before takeoff.

122
00:08:10,813 --> 00:08:12,646
Oh, I don't think
they knew about it.

123
00:08:12,648 --> 00:08:15,917
I never seen a storm this
big creep up out of nowhere.

124
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,419
We should have been able
to eyeball this thing

125
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:19,223
the moment we were
off the ground.

126
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,824
Yeah, these domestic
red-eyes are a nightmare, too.

127
00:08:23,826 --> 00:08:25,693
I've done my fair share.

128
00:08:25,695 --> 00:08:29,198
But after a while, I start,
you know, needing some daylight.

129
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,033
Any tips?

130
00:08:32,035 --> 00:08:34,469
All the coffee
in the world, my friend.

131
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:37,307
All the coffee in the world.

132
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:42,010
Any plans for New York?

133
00:08:42,012 --> 00:08:45,880
Absolutely.
Got a hot date.

134
00:08:47,183 --> 00:08:48,882
The most beautiful woman
you've ever seen.

135
00:08:48,884 --> 00:08:50,785
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

136
00:08:50,787 --> 00:08:53,755
What's her name?

137
00:08:53,757 --> 00:08:54,923
Don't know yet.

138
00:09:05,902 --> 00:09:07,569
Blanket make things better?

139
00:09:07,571 --> 00:09:08,969
Maybe.

140
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:10,804
I don't get people
who are afraid of flying.

141
00:09:10,806 --> 00:09:12,006
Like if you can't do it,
why try?

142
00:09:12,008 --> 00:09:13,641
I don't think it's the flying.

143
00:09:13,643 --> 00:09:15,544
I think it's being stuck in
a compressed metal tube

144
00:09:15,546 --> 00:09:16,978
that resembles a penis
while thinking

145
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,545
about falling and exploding.

146
00:09:18,547 --> 00:09:21,116
That's not an image
I want to think of.

147
00:09:21,118 --> 00:09:22,817
What?
A giant penis?

148
00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:24,652
Or the falling and exploding?

149
00:09:24,654 --> 00:09:27,088
Both.

150
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,323
Were you ever
afraid of planes?

151
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:31,959
I'm afraid of a lot of things.

152
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:33,562
But flying isn't one of them.

153
00:09:33,564 --> 00:09:38,866
Being up here, it's a
beautiful thing we do.

154
00:09:38,868 --> 00:09:40,367
And look at us.

155
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:42,337
Up here in the darkness
where no one can see us.

156
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:44,973
Still majestic birds
after all this time.

157
00:09:46,843 --> 00:09:47,976
How long has it been?

158
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:48,843
Like three years, girl.

159
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:54,915
Please? I'm busy.

160
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:56,351
You're shameless.

161
00:09:56,353 --> 00:09:58,120
- I'll get the next one.
- Oh my God.

162
00:09:58,122 --> 00:10:00,124
It's just...

163
00:10:46,202 --> 00:10:47,503
Ah!

164
00:10:50,473 --> 00:10:52,073
- What happened?
- No, no, there's something...

165
00:10:52,075 --> 00:10:53,540
- I saw...
- What?

166
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:55,008
- On the wing!
- Sir, please take your seat...

167
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,377
There's something out there!

168
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:57,978
- Sir, calm down.
- Easy, man.

169
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,015
You need to take a breath!

170
00:11:00,017 --> 00:11:00,948
I saw something!

171
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,549
Calm down, please.

172
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:04,555
Sir, the storm has
everyone shaken up.

173
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,656
Sir, please, please,
please take your seat, okay?

174
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:11,660
- Calm down.
- Come on. I can assure you

175
00:11:11,662 --> 00:11:13,461
that there's nothing like
that out there, okay?

176
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:15,096
Take your seat.
You need to calm down.

177
00:11:15,098 --> 00:11:18,135
Okay, okay.
I just need... excuse me.

178
00:11:24,574 --> 00:11:26,407
Oh, sir, I'm sorry.
You can't use the bathroom.

179
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:28,008
The captain hasn't turned
off the seatbelt sign.

180
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,946
Sir, don't close the door!

181
00:11:33,383 --> 00:11:34,683
You okay?

182
00:11:37,854 --> 00:11:40,954
Everything's fine, everyone.
Everything's fine.

183
00:11:40,956 --> 00:11:44,825
Excuse me?
What's happening?

184
00:11:44,827 --> 00:11:46,593
It's just nerves.
It happens.

185
00:11:46,595 --> 00:11:48,997
The storm has
everyone shaken up.

186
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,131
Literally, I take
this flight all the time.

187
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:52,400
This is the worst I've seen it.

188
00:11:52,402 --> 00:11:54,368
Do you live in Los Angeles?

189
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,472
No, my parents do.
We were just there on vacation.

190
00:11:57,474 --> 00:11:59,407
We're heading back
to New York... Brooklyn.

191
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:02,043
Actually, it was a
late honeymoon, really.

192
00:12:02,045 --> 00:12:03,745
Oh, well, congratulations.

193
00:12:03,747 --> 00:12:04,679
Thanks.

194
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:06,146
Let me ask you something.

195
00:12:06,148 --> 00:12:07,714
So what happens
when a passenger's

196
00:12:07,716 --> 00:12:10,053
more out of control,
like more than that?

197
00:12:12,355 --> 00:12:13,655
Um...

198
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:15,823
Generally, these situations
resolve themselves.

199
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:20,093
But we have protocols in place
for extreme situations.

200
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,497
Yeah, man.
That's scary.

201
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:26,067
As I said, these situations
usually resolve themselves.

202
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:28,138
Nothing to fear.

203
00:12:31,273 --> 00:12:34,074
Oh, it's just the storm!
It's just the storm!

204
00:12:34,076 --> 00:12:35,410
You're seeing things!

205
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:38,715
It's just the rain!
The turbulence.

206
00:12:55,264 --> 00:12:58,132
Sir! Sir!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

207
00:12:58,134 --> 00:12:59,367
- Sir!
- Let me out!

208
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:01,102
Let me off this plane!

209
00:13:01,104 --> 00:13:02,703
I can't be on this plane!

210
00:13:02,705 --> 00:13:04,305
Sir, please calm down!

211
00:13:04,307 --> 00:13:07,375
I can't be on this plane!
Get me off this plane!

212
00:13:07,377 --> 00:13:08,708
She tried to grab me.

213
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,045
Who tried to grab you?

214
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:11,478
A woman!
A woman in the mirror!

215
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,881
- A woman in the mirror!
- Excuse me!

216
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:15,516
- Get down! Get down!
- Liam, call the captain!

217
00:13:15,518 --> 00:13:16,916
Need any help?

218
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:18,719
No! I'm an Air Marshal.
Everything's fine!

219
00:13:18,721 --> 00:13:20,121
Back in your seat!

220
00:13:20,123 --> 00:13:21,488
Everyone back in
your seat, please!

221
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,190
- What happened?
- I don't know.

222
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:24,791
I think he's having
a panic attack.

223
00:13:24,793 --> 00:13:26,495
I'm not having a panic attack!
I saw something!

224
00:13:26,497 --> 00:13:27,828
Stop!

225
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,665
No, no, I saw something
in the mirror!

226
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:32,467
Okay, I'm going to have
to restrain this passenger

227
00:13:32,469 --> 00:13:34,135
'til we get to JFK.

228
00:13:34,137 --> 00:13:35,368
Do you have anything
to calm him down?

229
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,904
Yes, but we've never given...

230
00:13:36,906 --> 00:13:38,973
Whatever it is, grab it now!
Grab it now, grab it now!

231
00:13:38,975 --> 00:13:40,274
Hey, are you sure you
guys don't need any help?

232
00:13:40,276 --> 00:13:41,876
Everything's fine, okay?

233
00:13:41,878 --> 00:13:43,511
I'm a U.S. Air Marshal.
Back in your seat!

234
00:13:43,513 --> 00:13:46,282
Everyone back in your seats!

235
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:54,789
Oh my God, he's a terrorist!

236
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,092
No! I'm just dealing with
somebody who's a little detached

237
00:13:57,094 --> 00:13:59,430
from reality right now.

238
00:14:01,031 --> 00:14:03,100
Miss!

239
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:07,237
I really need you to hurry!

240
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,208
I can hear you people!

241
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,742
I'm not a terrorist!

242
00:14:15,744 --> 00:14:17,279
How am I a terrorist?

243
00:14:17,281 --> 00:14:19,550
I'm not making this up!

244
00:14:23,219 --> 00:14:24,352
You have to believe...

245
00:14:24,354 --> 00:14:27,387
Here we go.
Swallow! Swallow!

246
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:28,923
Swallow, that's what we
right there, okay?

247
00:14:28,925 --> 00:14:30,491
Swallow it.
Swallow it.

248
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:32,327
That's what we want.
Right there, okay?

249
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,563
We're okay.
Now we're good.

250
00:14:35,565 --> 00:14:39,366
Now we're calm.
Now we're calm.

251
00:14:39,368 --> 00:14:40,968
Are you tying him up?

252
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,304
Got to keep him under control.

253
00:14:43,306 --> 00:14:44,939
We still have a lot of
time left on this plane.

254
00:14:44,941 --> 00:14:46,875
I don't want him waking up
and freaking out, okay?

255
00:14:46,877 --> 00:14:50,645
Okay.

256
00:14:50,647 --> 00:14:52,246
- We can get him up right now.
- Okay.

257
00:14:52,248 --> 00:14:53,481
Come on.
Come on, come on.

258
00:14:53,483 --> 00:14:56,784
Okay, everybody
in first class,

259
00:14:56,786 --> 00:14:58,586
I need you to get up.

260
00:14:58,588 --> 00:15:00,255
And move to the back of
the plane right now, please!

261
00:15:00,257 --> 00:15:02,390
- Everyone out. Come on.
- So sorry.

262
00:15:02,392 --> 00:15:03,524
Sir, this way.

263
00:15:03,526 --> 00:15:06,394
Ma'am.
Ladies, you too.

264
00:15:06,396 --> 00:15:07,628
Thank you so much.

265
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,197
Okay, go ahead, sweetheart.

266
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,165
Thank you so much.

267
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:14,001
I am so sorry...

268
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:15,770
The passenger that
was giving us the issue

269
00:15:15,772 --> 00:15:18,372
has been restrained.
He's been medicated.

270
00:15:18,374 --> 00:15:20,141
Thank you so much
for your patience with us.

271
00:15:20,143 --> 00:15:23,211
I think that the flight
should return to normal now.

272
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,150
Again, I'm so sorry.

273
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:28,717
You okay?

274
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,184
That's what we want right there.

275
00:15:30,186 --> 00:15:32,523
Everything's okay!

276
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:39,295
All right.

277
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,285
You can't interfere
in stuff like this, Bran.

278
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:04,919
What?

279
00:16:04,921 --> 00:16:06,386
I just wanted to help.

280
00:16:06,388 --> 00:16:07,588
Yeah, I know,
but this isn't something

281
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,457
you should be involved in.

282
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:11,358
Okay. I'm sorry.

283
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,828
I guess I'm still in my head
about my parents.

284
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,462
I don't know what
their problem is.

285
00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:17,431
You said it was okay.

286
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:20,300
I believe you.

287
00:16:20,302 --> 00:16:21,401
I always believe you.

288
00:16:21,403 --> 00:16:24,338
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

289
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,342
Maybe next time,
it'll be better.

290
00:16:27,344 --> 00:16:29,680
Yeah. I hope so.

291
00:16:39,321 --> 00:16:41,756
This storm is huge.

292
00:16:41,758 --> 00:16:44,925
It's blanketing everything.

293
00:16:44,927 --> 00:16:48,231
Five minutes ago, it looked like
we'd be out of it in 20, but...

294
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,271
At least the altimeter
and fuel gauge are working.

295
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:00,308
Lightning screwing with us?

296
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,142
Yeah, looks like it.

297
00:17:02,144 --> 00:17:06,550
But it shouldn't be
doing all this at once.

298
00:17:15,358 --> 00:17:16,424
Flight Deck.

299
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:18,026
<i>Captain, it's Liam.</i>

300
00:17:18,028 --> 00:17:19,993
The storm caused a
passenger to freak out.

301
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:21,662
The marshal stepped in
and assisted

302
00:17:21,664 --> 00:17:24,397
but we had to sedate
and restrain him.

303
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:25,965
Restrain him?

304
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:27,937
Is everything under
control back there?

305
00:17:29,473 --> 00:17:31,473
I think so.

306
00:17:31,475 --> 00:17:33,407
Okay, good.

307
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:35,976
Just make sure
everybody's comfortable.

308
00:17:35,978 --> 00:17:38,279
The storm is the only thing
I wanna worry about right now.

309
00:17:38,281 --> 00:17:39,549
<i>Got it.</i>

310
00:18:03,438 --> 00:18:05,908
Okay. Here you are, ma'am.

311
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:21,455
Sir, what can I get you?

312
00:18:21,457 --> 00:18:25,460
- Just a water, please.
- Okay.

313
00:18:25,462 --> 00:18:27,127
Miss?

314
00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:30,196
I was wondering if you had
anything else I could snack on.

315
00:18:30,198 --> 00:18:35,368
I had the peanuts and
this gentleman gave me his.

316
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,805
But my stomach is
still rumbling.

317
00:18:37,807 --> 00:18:39,906
Oh, we're gonna start
the in-flight meals

318
00:18:39,908 --> 00:18:41,709
as soon as the storm dies down.

319
00:18:41,711 --> 00:18:45,011
Oh, okay, but is there
anything you can do?

320
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:47,882
If I get you one
of the prepackaged salads,

321
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:49,917
- would that help?
- Great.

322
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,152
Okay. All right.

323
00:19:00,163 --> 00:19:01,396
Shh.

324
00:19:01,398 --> 00:19:04,632
Here you go.

325
00:19:04,634 --> 00:19:06,800
Thank you, sir,
for sharing your peanuts.

326
00:19:06,802 --> 00:19:08,638
Of course.

327
00:19:16,445 --> 00:19:17,912
You think he saw a ghost?

328
00:19:17,914 --> 00:19:19,312
No.

329
00:19:19,314 --> 00:19:24,452
I mean, I think he probably
thought he saw one, but come on.

330
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:29,290
Yeah.
Probably just crazy.

331
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:32,926
You know, I think I saw
a ghost when I was little.

332
00:19:32,928 --> 00:19:34,662
Really?

333
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:37,264
I mean, maybe.

334
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:39,934
You know, you see things
you don't understand

335
00:19:39,936 --> 00:19:42,235
like walking down
an old hallway

336
00:19:42,237 --> 00:19:44,972
and you see someone out of
the corner of your eye.

337
00:19:44,974 --> 00:19:47,876
But you look
and they're gone.

338
00:19:47,878 --> 00:19:51,779
Or you're driving and
there's someone behind you.

339
00:19:51,781 --> 00:19:56,017
You look for them and
then they're just gone.

340
00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:58,551
Is that ghosts
or just other people?

341
00:19:58,553 --> 00:20:01,923
Okay, like this one time,

342
00:20:01,925 --> 00:20:06,594
I remember being in
my bed at night.

343
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:09,963
Lying on my side,
looking out my window

344
00:20:09,965 --> 00:20:12,433
at this line of trees
that's behind my house

345
00:20:12,435 --> 00:20:15,435
and I was blinking a lot 'cause
I'm trying to go to sleep.

346
00:20:15,437 --> 00:20:20,241
And there's this guy
that walks out of the woods.

347
00:20:20,243 --> 00:20:23,810
A guy?

348
00:20:23,812 --> 00:20:26,646
He looked like Frankenstein.

349
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:28,782
But that's probably not right.

350
00:20:30,218 --> 00:20:33,654
He started walking towards
the house through the backyard

351
00:20:33,656 --> 00:20:36,558
straight towards my window

352
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,126
until I could see
the whites of his eyes

353
00:20:39,128 --> 00:20:43,196
and then he just stood
there and looked at me.

354
00:20:43,198 --> 00:20:45,332
No shit.
What did you do?

355
00:20:45,334 --> 00:20:48,402
I freaked out.
I ran to my parents' room.

356
00:20:48,404 --> 00:20:51,071
Woke them up, told them
I saw a guy in my window.

357
00:20:51,073 --> 00:20:55,609
And then my dad, he came
in and looked around,

358
00:20:55,611 --> 00:20:59,446
but there was nobody there.

359
00:20:59,448 --> 00:21:01,250
They even went into
the backyard.

360
00:21:02,784 --> 00:21:04,719
They said I was dreaming.

361
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,157
Were you dreaming, though?
You think?

362
00:21:11,026 --> 00:21:15,030
I don't remember falling
asleep or waking up.

363
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,098
I mean, I don't...

364
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,269
I don't think
you saw a ghost, babe.

365
00:21:21,271 --> 00:21:23,570
I think you saw creeps.

366
00:21:23,572 --> 00:21:25,639
I don't know.

367
00:21:25,641 --> 00:21:28,744
Have you ever seen one?

368
00:21:31,546 --> 00:21:32,848
No.

369
00:21:34,183 --> 00:21:35,749
But I have seen an angel.

370
00:21:35,751 --> 00:21:37,385
Okay, you know that's
not gonna get you

371
00:21:37,387 --> 00:21:39,886
out of my happy wedding
conversation, right?

372
00:21:39,888 --> 00:21:41,555
All right, worth a
try, worth a try.

373
00:21:41,557 --> 00:21:43,290
I know.

374
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:45,529
- Cool it.
- All right.

375
00:22:06,315 --> 00:22:08,215
You know, if you give
someone a salad during a storm,

376
00:22:08,217 --> 00:22:09,683
we'll be picking
crouton crumblies

377
00:22:09,685 --> 00:22:11,085
off the floor for hours.

378
00:22:11,087 --> 00:22:13,754
I know, but she was very cute.

379
00:22:13,756 --> 00:22:15,489
This has been a flight, huh?

380
00:22:15,491 --> 00:22:16,957
I know.

381
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:19,193
I hope that's the worst
that will happen.

382
00:22:19,195 --> 00:22:20,961
Well, we've got
Charles Bronson

383
00:22:20,963 --> 00:22:23,233
over there keeping watch.
We should be fine.

384
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,002
You okay?

385
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:33,706
Okay, all right...

386
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,646
Need some help over here!

387
00:22:39,648 --> 00:22:40,947
Oh, my God!

388
00:22:40,949 --> 00:22:42,883
Ma'am, are you all right?

389
00:22:42,885 --> 00:22:45,219
- You bring a towel!
- Yeah.

390
00:22:45,221 --> 00:22:46,587
Napkins! Anything!

391
00:22:46,589 --> 00:22:47,655
Okay.

392
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,022
Can you breathe?
All right.

393
00:22:49,024 --> 00:22:50,424
She's coming back.
All right.

394
00:22:50,426 --> 00:22:52,928
The hits just keep coming.

395
00:22:53,796 --> 00:22:55,963
Here you go.

396
00:22:55,965 --> 00:22:57,464
Let's get you back in the seat.

397
00:22:57,466 --> 00:23:00,070
There you go.
Get up.

398
00:23:03,773 --> 00:23:05,138
Easy, easy.

399
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:09,012
I think it's in my hair.

400
00:23:11,781 --> 00:23:14,084
Check the other salads! Go!

401
00:23:25,427 --> 00:23:27,263
Jesus!

402
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,229
Flight Deck.

403
00:24:02,231 --> 00:24:04,298
<i>Hey, sorry to bother
you again...</i>

404
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,901
<i>Pan US57. Be advised,
you're rapidly approaching</i>

405
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,501
<i>a low-pressure system.</i>

406
00:24:08,503 --> 00:24:11,907
<i>It will be difficult to
continue tracing you at...</i>

407
00:24:12,841 --> 00:24:15,142
This is PAN US57, over.

408
00:24:15,144 --> 00:24:17,877
We're losing you.
PAN US57, over.

409
00:24:17,879 --> 00:24:20,780
<i>Pan... 57... Repeat.</i>

410
00:24:20,782 --> 00:24:22,450
<i>Advised... rapidly low
pressure...</i>

411
00:24:22,452 --> 00:24:24,087
<i>system, will be difficult
...to track you.</i>

412
00:24:27,189 --> 00:24:29,123
Liam, what's going on?

413
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:33,897
Our in-flight meals are,
well, they're rotten, I think.

414
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,229
Rotten?

415
00:24:36,231 --> 00:24:38,165
<i>They're like Satanic rotten.</i>

416
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:42,038
Full of maggots,
actual maggots.

417
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:46,040
That is disgusting.

418
00:24:46,042 --> 00:24:48,144
The in-flight meals
are rotten.

419
00:24:50,146 --> 00:24:51,546
Great.

420
00:24:51,548 --> 00:24:55,452
Have Liam call LAX.
Tell them about the food.

421
00:24:56,918 --> 00:24:58,918
Captain says to call LAX.

422
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,386
<i>Let them know about the food.</i>

423
00:25:00,388 --> 00:25:02,322
<i>There's not much
we can do from up here.</i>

424
00:25:02,324 --> 00:25:03,857
So just try and
keep the passengers

425
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:05,425
as comfortable as you can,

426
00:25:05,427 --> 00:25:08,231
and worst case, we'll take
care of them we land.

427
00:25:10,699 --> 00:25:12,265
What did he say?

428
00:25:12,267 --> 00:25:14,403
You keep
everyone comfortable.

429
00:25:16,805 --> 00:25:18,606
The phone's not working.

430
00:25:18,608 --> 00:25:21,274
We're running out of ways
to keep them comfortable.

431
00:25:21,276 --> 00:25:23,144
Seriously, bring
on the frogs!

432
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,478
What?

433
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,614
What else was there?
Locusts? Darkness?

434
00:25:26,616 --> 00:25:28,950
Yeah.
Bring on the...

435
00:25:33,955 --> 00:25:36,325
Ryan, go for shoulder straps!

436
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,367
No power to the engines?

437
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:48,135
That's gotta be
a technical bug!

438
00:25:48,137 --> 00:25:49,973
No way we got struck!

439
00:25:51,974 --> 00:25:53,973
No thrust!

440
00:25:53,975 --> 00:25:56,409
Altimeter's out!

441
00:25:56,411 --> 00:25:58,377
All right, we have to keep
the nose up in this glide!

442
00:25:58,379 --> 00:25:59,713
You got eyes on
the horizon, Ryan?

443
00:25:59,715 --> 00:26:01,214
I'm trying.

444
00:26:01,216 --> 00:26:02,849
I can't tell if it's up
or down right now.

445
00:26:02,851 --> 00:26:04,085
All right,
keep your eyes out there.

446
00:26:04,087 --> 00:26:06,354
Wait for a lightning strike!

447
00:26:17,966 --> 00:26:19,165
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

448
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:22,703
JFK center, this is
Pan US 57!

449
00:26:22,705 --> 00:26:23,904
We've got dual engine failure!

450
00:26:23,906 --> 00:26:25,505
I repeat, all engines out!

451
00:26:25,507 --> 00:26:27,607
Going for an engine failure
systems check!

452
00:26:27,609 --> 00:26:30,610
- Ryan! Anything?
- No...

453
00:26:30,612 --> 00:26:31,677
Come on!

454
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,012
We're in aerodynamic stall!

455
00:26:33,014 --> 00:26:34,481
We are dead stick!

456
00:26:34,483 --> 00:26:35,949
We've got to get
the APU fired up

457
00:26:35,951 --> 00:26:37,987
or we are up a shit's creek!

458
00:26:41,423 --> 00:26:43,827
Auxiliary's not working.
Shit!

459
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:46,993
30 degrees up!

460
00:26:46,995 --> 00:26:48,729
Copy that!

461
00:26:48,731 --> 00:26:50,163
Pull back with me!
We gotta get this nose level!

462
00:26:50,165 --> 00:26:53,403
Let's go!
Come on, come on!

463
00:27:09,851 --> 00:27:11,117
We're still dropping!

464
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:12,685
We need to get
the engines working!

465
00:27:12,687 --> 00:27:14,988
We get 'em spinning,
the generators will run!

466
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,357
What about the RAT?

467
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:19,158
Well, we're too far out.
Not gonna work.

468
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,263
Fire, damn it! Connect!

469
00:27:43,185 --> 00:27:45,918
Come on, fire, damn it!
Connect!

470
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,187
Connect, damn it!

471
00:27:48,189 --> 00:27:49,623
It's now or never, Jack!

472
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:50,924
We're at the point
of no return!

473
00:27:50,926 --> 00:27:53,996
Hold on.
Hold on!

474
00:27:54,897 --> 00:27:56,996
Please work, please work.

475
00:27:56,998 --> 00:27:58,500
Please work, please!

476
00:28:03,004 --> 00:28:05,472
Here we go!

477
00:28:05,474 --> 00:28:07,310
Come on, pull!

478
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,407
Thank God.

479
00:28:39,774 --> 00:28:42,108
Flight Lead,
please contact the cockpit.

480
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,345
<i>Thank you.</i>

481
00:28:44,812 --> 00:28:47,513
Good work.

482
00:28:47,515 --> 00:28:50,049
I've never seen a plane
die like that before.

483
00:28:50,051 --> 00:28:53,521
I have, but not like that.

484
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,388
Looks like you're getting
to see a lot of things

485
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:58,724
you never seen before tonight.

486
00:28:58,726 --> 00:29:02,095
Jesus Christ, I think
I almost had a heart attack.

487
00:29:06,034 --> 00:29:09,103
Okay.
Can you start the walkthrough?

488
00:29:09,105 --> 00:29:11,074
Yeah.

489
00:29:17,746 --> 00:29:19,180
<i>You okay back there?</i>

490
00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:24,151
Sir, you okay?

491
00:29:24,153 --> 00:29:26,552
How we doing over here?

492
00:29:26,554 --> 00:29:28,021
Yeah, I think so.

493
00:29:28,023 --> 00:29:29,588
That was a lot.

494
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:32,893
How about everyone else?
Any injuries?

495
00:29:32,895 --> 00:29:35,061
I don't know.

496
00:29:35,063 --> 00:29:36,930
I haven't started
the walk-through yet.

497
00:29:36,932 --> 00:29:38,598
Copy that.

498
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,434
<i>Looks like we're about
4:10 till we hit New York.</i>

499
00:29:41,436 --> 00:29:43,537
Just try to keep everyone
calm and comfortable.

500
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:45,172
And let's see if
we can make this

501
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:46,873
a better trip
from here on out.

502
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:48,875
<i>Last thing we need is
a plane full of angry people.</i>

503
00:29:48,877 --> 00:29:51,878
Okay. Thank you so much.
Yes?

504
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,880
Oh, sweetie, that looks bad.

505
00:29:53,882 --> 00:29:55,182
Oh, my God.

506
00:29:55,184 --> 00:29:56,415
Why don't we touch you up
in the restroom?

507
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:58,085
I'm not qualified for this.

508
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:00,690
Thanks.

509
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,496
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

510
00:30:19,274 --> 00:30:21,075
Are you okay?
My apologies.

511
00:30:21,077 --> 00:30:23,146
They're doing
everything they can.

512
00:30:33,888 --> 00:30:36,322
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
apologies for the turbulence.</i>

513
00:30:36,324 --> 00:30:38,258
<i>As you may have gathered,</i>

514
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,094
<i>our aircraft experienced
a brief loss of power</i>

515
00:30:40,096 --> 00:30:42,829
<i>which caused the drop
in altitude.</i>

516
00:30:42,831 --> 00:30:45,098
<i>But everything's
back in order.</i>

517
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:49,168
<i>Good news is, planes are made
to handle situations like this.</i>

518
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,604
<i>We hit a rough patch of sky.</i>

519
00:30:50,606 --> 00:30:52,204
<i>But it's our
number one priority</i>

520
00:30:52,206 --> 00:30:53,740
<i>to get you to New York,</i>

521
00:30:53,742 --> 00:30:55,642
<i>or wherever your
final destination</i>

522
00:30:55,644 --> 00:30:58,578
<i>may be with us this evening,
safe and sound.</i>

523
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,146
<i>Hoping to have you on
the ground in</i>

524
00:31:00,148 --> 00:31:01,681
<i>just about four hours.</i>

525
00:31:01,683 --> 00:31:03,884
<i>So just sit back
and try to relax.</i>

526
00:31:03,886 --> 00:31:06,118
<i>We'll be sending the flight
crew through the cabin</i>

527
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,988
<i>to make sure everyone's okay.</i>

528
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:11,558
<i>Once again, we apologize
for the discomfort.</i>

529
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,526
<i>On behalf of the airline
and the crew,</i>

530
00:31:13,528 --> 00:31:15,828
<i>we hope you enjoy the
remainder of the flight.</i>

531
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:19,232
Hey, why... why am I...

532
00:31:19,234 --> 00:31:20,867
It's just a zip tie, okay?

533
00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:24,136
- Zip tie? But...
- Shh.

534
00:31:24,138 --> 00:31:25,771
You had an episode.

535
00:31:25,773 --> 00:31:27,507
I had to restrain you.

536
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:30,677
- All I'm saying...
- It's for your own good.

537
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:34,882
But... No, no.
You don't understand...

538
00:31:34,884 --> 00:31:36,883
I'm gonna tell
you one more time!

539
00:31:36,885 --> 00:31:38,050
Shh!

540
00:31:38,052 --> 00:31:39,520
Listen to me.

541
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:43,723
You have the right
to remain silent.

542
00:31:43,725 --> 00:31:49,194
And if I were you, that's
exactly what I would do.

543
00:31:49,196 --> 00:31:50,329
All right.

544
00:31:50,331 --> 00:31:53,335
- Relax.
- Okay.

545
00:32:46,353 --> 00:32:49,758
JFK Center, PAN-US 57.

546
00:32:54,128 --> 00:32:59,767
LAX Center, PAN-US 57?
We've lost contact with JFK.

547
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,671
Do you copy?

548
00:33:02,905 --> 00:33:07,074
Shit, I can't get anyone.

549
00:33:07,076 --> 00:33:10,743
They were updating us on
the pressure systems.

550
00:33:10,745 --> 00:33:13,746
This all happened after
we lost power.

551
00:33:13,748 --> 00:33:16,015
Keep trying.
They'll come back.

552
00:33:16,017 --> 00:33:18,385
What about the systems check?

553
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:20,253
I've ran through the book.

554
00:33:20,255 --> 00:33:21,887
The plane can fly.

555
00:33:21,889 --> 00:33:27,263
But after the outage,
we got a few problems.

556
00:33:28,964 --> 00:33:32,265
According to the diagnostics,
the cabin pressure's good.

557
00:33:32,267 --> 00:33:35,401
Fuel's good.

558
00:33:35,403 --> 00:33:36,869
Landing gear...

559
00:33:36,871 --> 00:33:38,437
Landing gear is out.
Coms are down.

560
00:33:38,439 --> 00:33:40,139
And autopilot's gone?

561
00:33:40,141 --> 00:33:42,608
- Yeah.
- Okay, well...

562
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,444
This plane may not be brand new,

563
00:33:44,446 --> 00:33:46,145
but it's one of the
greatest ever built.

564
00:33:46,147 --> 00:33:49,281
Keep our hands on the wheel,
we should be just fine.

565
00:33:49,283 --> 00:33:50,817
What about FMS?

566
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:53,720
What happens if, for some
reason, we lose navigation?

567
00:33:53,722 --> 00:33:56,723
You've never flown one of
these things before, have you?

568
00:33:56,725 --> 00:33:59,193
Through a storm
with engine failure?

569
00:33:59,195 --> 00:34:01,228
Not really.

570
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,629
Keep calm, kid, all right?

571
00:34:03,631 --> 00:34:04,932
I've been through
worse than this.

572
00:34:04,934 --> 00:34:07,567
Keep your head on.

573
00:34:07,569 --> 00:34:10,273
What's ATIS saying about
the weather report?

574
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:15,842
Well, still surrounded.

575
00:34:15,844 --> 00:34:18,645
Even if we wanted
to divert our path,

576
00:34:18,647 --> 00:34:21,148
according to the data,
there's no way around it

577
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,352
and we're stuck in the middle.

578
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,157
I can't see
anything out there.

579
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,592
Look, equipment,
no equipment,

580
00:34:32,594 --> 00:34:36,496
radio or no radio,
storms only last so long.

581
00:34:36,498 --> 00:34:38,665
We'll be through this shortly.

582
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:41,871
Your head.
Keep it on.

583
00:34:43,237 --> 00:34:44,806
I'll do my best.

584
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,337
What?
Oh my God!

585
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:18,873
What?

586
00:35:20,308 --> 00:35:21,507
What's going on?

587
00:35:21,509 --> 00:35:24,446
Hello? Hello?

588
00:35:29,384 --> 00:35:31,684
Ma'am?

589
00:35:31,686 --> 00:35:33,656
Excuse me, ma'am?

590
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,393
Ma'am, can you hear me?

591
00:35:40,395 --> 00:35:42,728
Ma'am?

592
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:46,632
Can you let me know
that you're okay, please?

593
00:35:46,634 --> 00:35:48,835
Help! I can't get out!

594
00:35:48,837 --> 00:35:52,306
The door won't open!
Somebody, please help me!

595
00:35:52,308 --> 00:35:53,840
Ma'am?

596
00:35:53,842 --> 00:35:56,210
I'm sorry ma'am, the lock
override is stuck.

597
00:35:56,212 --> 00:35:58,177
I can't open the door
from this side.

598
00:35:58,179 --> 00:36:00,547
I can't get out!
Help me!

599
00:36:00,549 --> 00:36:02,215
Ma'am?

600
00:36:02,217 --> 00:36:05,451
Can you... Can you let me know
that you're okay, please?

601
00:36:05,453 --> 00:36:08,957
I can't get out!
Hello?

602
00:36:53,802 --> 00:36:55,671
Ma'am, please.

603
00:36:57,505 --> 00:36:59,204
Ma'am? Please.

604
00:36:59,206 --> 00:37:01,474
Okay, someone's coming
to help, okay?

605
00:37:01,476 --> 00:37:02,842
Please just stay calm.

606
00:37:02,844 --> 00:37:05,378
If you can hear me, stay calm.

607
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,348
What's up?

608
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:11,516
I think that there's
a woman trapped inside.

609
00:37:11,518 --> 00:37:13,119
She's stuck?

610
00:37:13,121 --> 00:37:18,657
Yeah. The locking mechanism,
isn't working properly.

611
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:20,527
All right, here.
Let me try.

612
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,164
Okay.

613
00:37:29,505 --> 00:37:31,173
Ma'am?

614
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:35,808
Ma'am?

615
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,543
This is the U.S. Air Marshal.

616
00:37:37,545 --> 00:37:39,311
I need you to open
this door right now.

617
00:37:39,313 --> 00:37:42,315
Your right, the lock override
switch seems to be jammed.

618
00:37:42,317 --> 00:37:44,717
We need something
to pry open the door with.

619
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:47,656
Oh, okay, we have, um...

620
00:37:56,397 --> 00:37:59,534
Oh, great. Um...

621
00:38:05,473 --> 00:38:08,842
There's a killer
on your plane.

622
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:11,844
All right.

623
00:38:11,846 --> 00:38:13,478
Ma'am, on the count
of three,

624
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,614
I want you to push the door
open from the inside, okay?

625
00:38:17,152 --> 00:38:19,719
What?
What?

626
00:38:19,721 --> 00:38:22,521
I don't understand
what you're saying!

627
00:38:22,523 --> 00:38:23,523
There's a killer.

628
00:38:23,525 --> 00:38:27,626
One, two, three!

629
00:38:29,397 --> 00:38:32,166
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

630
00:38:33,835 --> 00:38:36,902
Okay. Come on, sweetie.
Come on.

631
00:38:36,904 --> 00:38:39,371
Come on.

632
00:38:39,373 --> 00:38:42,608
Okay, okay.
Shh, okay.

633
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,578
Okay.

634
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,112
This way.

635
00:38:46,114 --> 00:38:48,748
Yeah, can you take
a seat for me?

636
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,686
Good girl, good girl.

637
00:38:53,422 --> 00:38:54,721
What happened?

638
00:38:54,723 --> 00:38:57,025
The mirror, the mirror!

639
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:00,460
What about the mirror?

640
00:39:00,462 --> 00:39:03,596
I saw her.
She was pregnant.

641
00:39:03,598 --> 00:39:05,665
I couldn't breathe!

642
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:07,302
That doesn't make any sense.

643
00:39:10,105 --> 00:39:12,072
We're gonna get you
to your seat,

644
00:39:12,074 --> 00:39:13,806
we're gonna get you
comfortable okay?

645
00:39:13,808 --> 00:39:15,741
Can you stand up for me?

646
00:39:15,743 --> 00:39:18,911
Come on, okay?

647
00:39:18,913 --> 00:39:21,748
It's okay.
Shh, shh, shh.

648
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,715
It's okay. It's okay.

649
00:39:23,717 --> 00:39:25,851
It's okay, all right?

650
00:39:25,853 --> 00:39:28,420
It's okay.

651
00:39:28,422 --> 00:39:30,322
Thank you.

652
00:39:30,324 --> 00:39:31,993
Go ahead, take a seat.

653
00:40:00,721 --> 00:40:02,621
What is going on?
Seriously.

654
00:40:02,623 --> 00:40:04,324
We're never flying this
flight again is what's going on.

655
00:40:04,326 --> 00:40:06,159
No, I'm serious, Bran!

656
00:40:06,161 --> 00:40:08,628
Okay, that guy freaks out,
there's maggots in the food!

657
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,663
- Hey.
- No, no.

658
00:40:09,665 --> 00:40:11,130
People are throwing up,

659
00:40:11,132 --> 00:40:12,532
the lights are going out
in the plane.

660
00:40:12,534 --> 00:40:14,166
People are getting hurt,

661
00:40:14,168 --> 00:40:15,735
And that poor woman,
I don't know what's going on!

662
00:40:15,737 --> 00:40:17,402
I know.
I don't know either.

663
00:40:17,404 --> 00:40:20,373
We're in a... hey, we're in
a hell of a storm, okay?

664
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:22,275
And storms pass, all right?

665
00:40:22,277 --> 00:40:24,677
- Are you okay?
- I thought we were gonna die.

666
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:26,445
You're not gonna die.

667
00:40:26,447 --> 00:40:29,916
The Air Marshal said that
the crazy one was a terrorist.

668
00:40:29,918 --> 00:40:32,018
Okay, ma'am,
he didn't say that.

669
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,351
I think he actually said
the opposite.

670
00:40:33,353 --> 00:40:35,020
Hey, what are we supposed

671
00:40:35,022 --> 00:40:36,556
to do when there's
a crazy person on the plane?

672
00:40:36,558 --> 00:40:38,157
I mean, what if he hurts
somebody?

673
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:40,192
Okay, well, maybe
we shouldn't call him crazy?

674
00:40:40,194 --> 00:40:42,027
And what's this
talk about ghosts?

675
00:40:42,029 --> 00:40:43,630
Okay, nothing, right?

676
00:40:43,632 --> 00:40:45,098
It's just...

677
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,199
We're all just a little
frazzled right now.

678
00:40:48,201 --> 00:40:50,869
It's a malfunction,
a malfunction of the plane.

679
00:40:50,871 --> 00:40:52,070
That's it.

680
00:40:52,072 --> 00:40:53,639
Look, all I know is
you better

681
00:40:53,641 --> 00:40:55,208
keep that man away from
me.

682
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:57,175
'Cause I just want
to get on the ground.

683
00:40:57,177 --> 00:40:59,112
You know, maybe we got
struck by lightning, you know?

684
00:40:59,114 --> 00:41:00,514
I mean, that explains
the power going in and out.

685
00:41:00,516 --> 00:41:02,516
Lightning hits planes
in the air all the time.

686
00:41:02,518 --> 00:41:04,183
What?
Are you a mechanic?

687
00:41:04,185 --> 00:41:06,085
No, I'm a teacher
and I watch the news.

688
00:41:06,087 --> 00:41:08,353
Okay, you know what?
Cool it, all right?

689
00:41:08,355 --> 00:41:10,724
We're in a storm, okay?
We're on a plane.

690
00:41:10,726 --> 00:41:12,190
The plane is a machine.

691
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,893
If you so much as use
your cell phone,

692
00:41:13,895 --> 00:41:15,594
the signals get
jumbled, all right?

693
00:41:15,596 --> 00:41:17,563
So if we're this high up
covered by clouds surrounded

694
00:41:17,565 --> 00:41:20,666
by lightning, of course,
some shit's gonna go wrong.

695
00:41:20,668 --> 00:41:22,467
So, please stop
making accusations

696
00:41:22,469 --> 00:41:24,170
if you guys don't even
know it's true.

697
00:41:24,172 --> 00:41:27,507
You'll only make everyone panic.

698
00:41:27,509 --> 00:41:28,741
Exactly.

699
00:41:28,743 --> 00:41:30,442
Everyone just take
a deep breath.

700
00:41:30,444 --> 00:41:33,846
Sit back and try to relax.

701
00:41:33,848 --> 00:41:36,016
Are you sure
everything's normal?

702
00:41:36,018 --> 00:41:39,284
No, I'm not sure,

703
00:41:39,286 --> 00:41:43,255
but it's not supernatural.

704
00:41:43,257 --> 00:41:46,759
We're on a plane and
planes have problems.

705
00:41:46,761 --> 00:41:48,860
Something's not right, Bran.

706
00:41:48,862 --> 00:41:51,764
I know, look.

707
00:41:51,766 --> 00:41:53,800
How about we take our
mind off this?

708
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,634
Like music maybe?

709
00:41:55,636 --> 00:41:57,570
You still haven't listened
to the mix tape

710
00:41:57,572 --> 00:42:00,806
that my brother put on
your phone in L.A., right?

711
00:42:00,808 --> 00:42:02,942
I don't know.
I don't know.

712
00:42:02,944 --> 00:42:04,177
It feels weird.

713
00:42:04,179 --> 00:42:07,045
Okay, okay,
babe, babe, babe.

714
00:42:07,047 --> 00:42:10,949
We're in a storm,
but storms pass, okay?

715
00:42:10,951 --> 00:42:13,886
Now if I open my carry-on
and snakes fall out...

716
00:42:15,322 --> 00:42:16,790
I'll be the first to
let you know, okay?

717
00:42:16,792 --> 00:42:18,927
- Okay.
- Okay.

718
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:40,212
Hey!
Listen to me!

719
00:42:40,214 --> 00:42:41,815
You're really stupid
if you think

720
00:42:41,817 --> 00:42:44,550
I'm letting you
out of my sight.

721
00:42:44,552 --> 00:42:46,121
Relax!

722
00:42:51,092 --> 00:42:53,796
Revenge!
He wouldn't stop!

723
00:42:58,567 --> 00:43:00,866
Did you say something to me?

724
00:43:00,868 --> 00:43:02,969
What?

725
00:43:02,971 --> 00:43:06,672
I... um...

726
00:43:06,674 --> 00:43:08,509
I thought I heard something.

727
00:43:14,982 --> 00:43:16,215
Where are you?

728
00:43:16,217 --> 00:43:19,853
Please help!
So dark down here...

729
00:43:19,855 --> 00:43:21,987
Okay, did you not hear that?

730
00:43:21,989 --> 00:43:23,755
Hear what?

731
00:43:23,757 --> 00:43:27,960
There's someone trying to call
me or speak to me or something.

732
00:43:27,962 --> 00:43:29,596
What?

733
00:43:32,433 --> 00:43:34,599
What am I trying to hear?
I don't hear anything.

734
00:43:34,601 --> 00:43:37,138
- Brandon?
- What?

735
00:43:42,643 --> 00:43:44,178
Nothing.

736
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,058
Murder!

737
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,326
Shit! Did you mess with
my volume or something?

738
00:44:01,328 --> 00:44:02,329
No.

739
00:44:02,331 --> 00:44:03,596
Oh, my God!

740
00:44:03,598 --> 00:44:05,197
Did you sit on it
or something? Jesus!

741
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:06,065
No!

742
00:44:06,067 --> 00:44:08,237
Are my ears bleeding?

743
00:44:11,139 --> 00:44:14,042
Danika, what's going on?
You're scaring me.

744
00:44:22,817 --> 00:44:24,849
My...

745
00:44:24,851 --> 00:44:26,520
Hey.

746
00:44:56,618 --> 00:44:57,483
Captain?

747
00:44:57,485 --> 00:44:58,817
What the...

748
00:44:58,819 --> 00:45:00,552
Alice, there's
procedure for a reason.

749
00:45:00,554 --> 00:45:02,654
You can't just barge
in here like that.

750
00:45:02,656 --> 00:45:04,357
Look, three hours and some
change, we'll be on the ground.

751
00:45:04,359 --> 00:45:06,458
That's what
I'm worried about.

752
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:09,996
That's what we're all
worried about.

753
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,463
We're losing this flight.

754
00:45:11,465 --> 00:45:13,433
I need you to take control now!

755
00:45:13,435 --> 00:45:14,800
I'm sorry?

756
00:45:14,802 --> 00:45:17,703
So far, we've had a
lightning storm, rotten food.

757
00:45:17,705 --> 00:45:20,873
People having panic attacks.
And then losing power?

758
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:23,942
I don't know what this is
but it isn't normal.

759
00:45:28,081 --> 00:45:29,681
She's got a point.

760
00:45:29,683 --> 00:45:33,686
Look, Alice.
I need you to calm down, okay?

761
00:45:33,688 --> 00:45:35,520
It's a rough flight.

762
00:45:35,522 --> 00:45:37,489
But you've been doing this
long enough, you should know.

763
00:45:37,491 --> 00:45:39,157
All right, I don't know
what's going on back there.

764
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:40,793
I have no idea
what the problem is.

765
00:45:40,795 --> 00:45:42,695
But I can't be back there
to fix it personally.

766
00:45:42,697 --> 00:45:44,130
I'm doing everything I can
to keep us in the air!

767
00:45:44,132 --> 00:45:45,898
Yes, sir. I...

768
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,699
Oh, I know you're trying
and you're doing a great job.

769
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:50,339
It's just we're doing
all we can up here.

770
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,542
Sorry, Alice.

771
00:45:55,177 --> 00:45:57,379
Yes, sir.
I understand.

772
00:45:59,279 --> 00:46:02,348
Look, I'm not trying
to be a hard-ass here.

773
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:05,851
It's just that, if we can
all make it through

774
00:46:05,853 --> 00:46:10,257
this flight without losing
our minds, drinks are on me.

775
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,835
You seeing this?

776
00:46:21,837 --> 00:46:23,739
See what?

777
00:46:24,873 --> 00:46:26,575
What is that?

778
00:46:30,377 --> 00:46:32,480
Up there in the clouds?

779
00:46:33,514 --> 00:46:35,047
Are those birds?

780
00:46:35,049 --> 00:46:37,717
Uh, that's impossible.

781
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:40,320
Birds don't fly
at this altitude.

782
00:46:40,322 --> 00:46:42,457
Well, then what
in the world...

783
00:46:49,663 --> 00:46:52,133
Are those people?

784
00:46:55,069 --> 00:46:56,536
What are you talking about?

785
00:46:56,538 --> 00:46:58,137
Captain, I...

786
00:46:58,139 --> 00:46:59,637
I don't see anything.

787
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:02,342
You're not seeing this?
Right here!

788
00:47:02,344 --> 00:47:04,346
I swear to Christ!

789
00:47:11,185 --> 00:47:13,485
People?

790
00:47:13,487 --> 00:47:17,021
Uh, you want me to
take over for a minute?

791
00:47:17,023 --> 00:47:20,092
Maybe, you know, I think a
break might do you some good.

792
00:47:20,094 --> 00:47:21,427
Maybe some coffee or something?

793
00:47:21,429 --> 00:47:23,128
A break?
No, I don't need a break.

794
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:24,563
Shit!

795
00:47:24,565 --> 00:47:27,168
A bottle of water,
please, Alice?

796
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:36,208
Jack, there's no shame
in being exhausted.

797
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:38,309
It's a red-eye direct
coast to coast.

798
00:47:38,311 --> 00:47:40,112
And look at what
we're flying in.

799
00:47:40,114 --> 00:47:42,083
I know. I'm just...

800
00:47:42,984 --> 00:47:44,650
Scared?

801
00:47:44,652 --> 00:47:46,851
Yeah, me too.

802
00:47:46,853 --> 00:47:49,857
Yeah, maybe a little.

803
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:53,291
I don't know.
Something's not right.

804
00:47:53,293 --> 00:47:56,297
Something just
doesn't feel right.

805
00:47:57,598 --> 00:48:00,132
Your hands have been shaking.

806
00:48:00,134 --> 00:48:03,136
Are they?

807
00:48:03,138 --> 00:48:05,574
Didn't even notice.

808
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:09,041
I guess I just got
a lot on my mind.

809
00:48:15,282 --> 00:48:16,618
Thanks.

810
00:48:21,154 --> 00:48:23,290
What'd you see?

811
00:48:28,763 --> 00:48:30,632
I don't know.

812
00:50:07,527 --> 00:50:10,331
Make sure this
stays open, okay?

813
00:50:21,009 --> 00:50:22,644
Dani?

814
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:14,862
Brandon?

815
00:51:16,063 --> 00:51:17,228
What?

816
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:19,431
I don't feel well.

817
00:51:19,433 --> 00:51:21,335
What's going on?

818
00:51:22,737 --> 00:51:24,436
Would you think it was
weird if I thought

819
00:51:24,438 --> 00:51:28,475
there was something else
on this flight?

820
00:51:30,411 --> 00:51:33,078
Is it like your
Frankenstein thing?

821
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,712
No.

822
00:51:34,714 --> 00:51:37,016
I'm not following.

823
00:51:37,018 --> 00:51:38,683
Dani?
Dani?

824
00:51:38,685 --> 00:51:42,353
Honey, hey!
Dani!

825
00:51:42,355 --> 00:51:44,625
Are you okay?

826
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:48,360
Do you have aspirin?

827
00:51:48,362 --> 00:51:49,994
Uh, yeah.

828
00:51:49,996 --> 00:51:52,533
I think there's some
in my carry-on.

829
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:19,094
The killer...

830
00:52:20,594 --> 00:52:23,598
There's a killer on this plane.

831
00:52:25,165 --> 00:52:26,465
I... I...

832
00:52:26,467 --> 00:52:27,799
I don't know
what's happening!

833
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:30,001
There's a killer
on this plane!

834
00:52:30,003 --> 00:52:32,070
There's a killer
on this plane!

835
00:52:32,072 --> 00:52:34,572
There's a killer...

836
00:52:34,574 --> 00:52:36,208
Dani?
Dani!

837
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:37,645
Hey!

838
00:52:38,913 --> 00:52:41,480
Hey, babe, hey.

839
00:52:41,482 --> 00:52:43,916
You're okay,
you're okay.

840
00:52:43,918 --> 00:52:45,750
Look at me, look at me.
You're fine.

841
00:52:45,752 --> 00:52:47,219
You're okay.
You're okay.

842
00:52:47,221 --> 00:52:49,924
Come on.
Okay, come on.

843
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:54,462
You're okay. Come on.
Come on, honey.

844
00:52:55,462 --> 00:52:57,529
It's okay, it's all right.

845
00:52:57,531 --> 00:52:58,630
What happened?

846
00:52:58,632 --> 00:53:02,266
Get it away from me!

847
00:53:02,268 --> 00:53:04,703
Get what away from you?
There's nothing there.

848
00:53:04,705 --> 00:53:07,206
Baby, look,
there's nothing there.

849
00:53:07,208 --> 00:53:08,641
Dani, look, look.

850
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:10,375
Look, look. There's nothing
there, babe.

851
00:53:10,377 --> 00:53:14,579
Hey! How about you two quit
freaking everybody out!

852
00:53:14,581 --> 00:53:16,181
We're not trying
to freak anybody out!

853
00:53:16,183 --> 00:53:18,284
Guys, keep your
voices down, all right?

854
00:53:18,286 --> 00:53:20,284
This is not making it better.
In fact, it's making it worse.

855
00:53:20,286 --> 00:53:21,753
- This is some bullshit!
- Sir...

856
00:53:21,755 --> 00:53:24,525
I'm just trying
to calm her down!

857
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,829
Better?

858
00:53:28,462 --> 00:53:29,994
What did you see?

859
00:53:29,996 --> 00:53:31,596
A woman, I think.

860
00:53:31,598 --> 00:53:35,500
She was dead in the bin.
Stuffed in there!

861
00:53:35,502 --> 00:53:37,802
I opened it and
she grabbed me.

862
00:53:37,804 --> 00:53:40,338
And I know there's
nothing there

863
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,708
but it looked and
it felt so real!

864
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:44,543
I believe you.

865
00:53:44,545 --> 00:53:46,244
- You do?
- Yeah.

866
00:53:46,246 --> 00:53:48,846
Something's going on here.
We just need to find out what.

867
00:53:48,848 --> 00:53:51,616
Hey, is she all right?

868
00:53:51,618 --> 00:53:55,654
Uh, yeah, I think so.

869
00:53:55,656 --> 00:53:57,857
I'm fine. I promise.

870
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:59,657
I just don't know
what's going on.

871
00:53:59,659 --> 00:54:01,659
All right, I'm done.
Look, excuse me.

872
00:54:01,661 --> 00:54:03,262
I'm gonna go to the bathroom,
all right?

873
00:54:03,264 --> 00:54:05,467
You really don't wanna
go to the bathroom!

874
00:54:07,802 --> 00:54:12,670
Oh, great.
Mr. Crazy Man's awake.

875
00:54:12,672 --> 00:54:14,940
Please don't say it, okay?

876
00:54:14,942 --> 00:54:16,875
There are no
terrorists on this plane.

877
00:54:16,877 --> 00:54:20,748
Look, Mr. Marshal.
Come here.

878
00:54:24,351 --> 00:54:27,953
Why don't we just tie her
ass to the chair and...

879
00:54:27,955 --> 00:54:29,154
Sir!

880
00:54:29,156 --> 00:54:30,489
I won't let you
tie her down!

881
00:54:30,491 --> 00:54:32,056
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

882
00:54:32,058 --> 00:54:33,991
No one's gonna get tied down
to anything, okay?

883
00:54:33,993 --> 00:54:35,695
You keep her calm,
you got nothing to worry about.

884
00:54:35,697 --> 00:54:37,228
Right.
I just don't understand, okay?

885
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:39,130
I don't understand
what's going on.

886
00:54:39,132 --> 00:54:40,733
I don't understand
what's going on with my wife.

887
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,201
Look, nobody knows
what's going on.

888
00:54:42,203 --> 00:54:43,902
But the one thing that
I do know is

889
00:54:43,904 --> 00:54:45,637
that I trust the man
with the badge.

890
00:54:45,639 --> 00:54:47,405
And the gun?

891
00:54:47,407 --> 00:54:51,476
Look, there's a lot of crazy
unseen shit going on here.

892
00:54:51,478 --> 00:54:53,011
I don't know what it is.

893
00:54:53,013 --> 00:54:54,646
But I do know that this woman
here has to be detained!

894
00:54:54,648 --> 00:54:56,415
Hey, hey, hey!
Enough.

895
00:54:56,417 --> 00:54:58,016
Easy! Enough!
Listen to me.

896
00:54:58,018 --> 00:54:59,684
We are just trying to get
back to our families

897
00:54:59,686 --> 00:55:01,186
just like everybody
in this place.

898
00:55:01,188 --> 00:55:02,721
Get to your seat.
Just get to your seat.

899
00:55:02,723 --> 00:55:04,556
Hey, enough! Enough!

900
00:55:04,558 --> 00:55:06,058
I said in your seat now!

901
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:09,163
Sit down! Hey!
In your seat now!

902
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:12,364
Now listen up!

903
00:55:12,366 --> 00:55:17,001
I need everyone to keep
their head on their shoulders!

904
00:55:17,003 --> 00:55:19,105
Let's stay calm, okay?

905
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:20,905
Now I don't
think it's terrorism.

906
00:55:20,907 --> 00:55:22,907
So let's stop using that word.

907
00:55:22,909 --> 00:55:25,509
That word just gets
everyone worked up.

908
00:55:25,511 --> 00:55:27,779
- Yeah, but what if...
- Don't!

909
00:55:27,781 --> 00:55:29,447
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

910
00:55:29,449 --> 00:55:31,284
What? Are we in North Korea now?
We can't express ourselves?

911
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:33,819
Really?
Are you serious?

912
00:55:33,821 --> 00:55:36,020
Look, I'm sorry.

913
00:55:36,022 --> 00:55:37,655
I'm not usually this
much of an asshole.

914
00:55:37,657 --> 00:55:38,958
I just wanna get
on the ground!

915
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,425
Hey! Hey!

916
00:55:40,427 --> 00:55:42,695
Look, it's scary when
the plane malfunctions.

917
00:55:42,697 --> 00:55:44,329
It is.

918
00:55:44,331 --> 00:55:46,098
But we are people who
do this for a living.

919
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,636
So let us do our job
and we will be fine.

920
00:55:50,003 --> 00:55:52,637
See? That's exactly what
I was saying, malfunction.

921
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:54,038
So what are
we talking about here?

922
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,641
Gas leak?
Loss of cabin pressure?

923
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,043
I didn't say that.

924
00:55:57,045 --> 00:55:58,509
How much longer until
we get to New York?

925
00:55:58,511 --> 00:56:00,012
Are we gonna be okay?

926
00:56:00,014 --> 00:56:01,313
It's just gonna be
a couple more hours, okay?

927
00:56:01,315 --> 00:56:02,681
We're almost there.

928
00:56:02,683 --> 00:56:04,282
Miss?

929
00:56:04,284 --> 00:56:06,317
Could you please check
in with the captain?

930
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:08,989
Make sure all the mechanical
issues are in order, please?

931
00:56:14,828 --> 00:56:16,795
What do you think
is going on here?

932
00:56:16,797 --> 00:56:19,630
We are losing
electricity often.

933
00:56:19,632 --> 00:56:21,599
It's a good place to start.

934
00:56:21,601 --> 00:56:23,067
I'm no mechanic.

935
00:56:23,069 --> 00:56:24,737
But I'm sure the captain's
doing everything

936
00:56:24,739 --> 00:56:26,438
he's supposed to be doing
on his end.

937
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,773
Most important thing is
we're still in the air.

938
00:56:29,775 --> 00:56:31,775
We got that going for us.

939
00:56:31,777 --> 00:56:33,612
Fantastic, fantastic.

940
00:56:33,614 --> 00:56:35,815
Finally, somebody that knows
what the hell they're doing.

941
00:56:35,817 --> 00:56:38,583
Hey, sir, you keep
talking like that,

942
00:56:38,585 --> 00:56:41,119
the two of us are gonna have
a real serious problem.

943
00:56:41,121 --> 00:56:43,755
So I need you to sit here
and keep your mouth shut.

944
00:56:43,757 --> 00:56:45,757
You got that?

945
00:56:45,759 --> 00:56:47,828
Yeah.

946
00:56:48,761 --> 00:56:50,862
I'm so sorry about all this.

947
00:56:50,864 --> 00:56:52,563
Hey, hey...

948
00:56:52,565 --> 00:56:54,933
Hey, don't be
sorry, okay?

949
00:56:54,935 --> 00:56:58,036
You didn't do anything wrong.

950
00:56:58,038 --> 00:56:59,804
I don't know what's happening.

951
00:56:59,806 --> 00:57:02,474
Did you take the aspirin?

952
00:57:02,476 --> 00:57:04,009
Of course, but I wouldn't...

953
00:57:04,011 --> 00:57:05,677
Don't worry, sweetheart.

954
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:07,478
You all do realize
that if there is

955
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,349
a major malfunction while we're
in the air during a storm,

956
00:57:10,351 --> 00:57:11,884
that's worse
than ghosts, right?

957
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:13,319
Because that can
actually kill us.

958
00:57:13,321 --> 00:57:15,087
Okay, the plane
is not haunted.

959
00:57:15,089 --> 00:57:17,489
That's an insane theory.

960
00:57:17,491 --> 00:57:19,958
Look, why don't
we just land the plane

961
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,826
and check for problems
on the ground?

962
00:57:21,828 --> 00:57:23,862
Look, has the captain
mentioned anything

963
00:57:23,864 --> 00:57:25,898
about when and where
we're gonna land?

964
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,967
From what I can tell,
the storm

965
00:57:27,969 --> 00:57:30,101
is making it hard
to get anywhere.

966
00:57:30,103 --> 00:57:31,869
I mean, at this point,
trying to land in this,

967
00:57:31,871 --> 00:57:34,241
we're safer up here.

968
00:57:37,177 --> 00:57:39,677
Excuse me?

969
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:41,079
What about the storm?

970
00:57:41,081 --> 00:57:42,815
Do you have any idea
when it'll be behind us?

971
00:57:42,817 --> 00:57:45,550
No. I mean, at this point, the
storm's blanketing everything.

972
00:57:45,552 --> 00:57:47,219
It seems to be
tracking with us.

973
00:57:47,221 --> 00:57:49,654
- Excuse me!
- What do you want?

974
00:57:49,656 --> 00:57:50,889
It's not electrical.

975
00:58:56,723 --> 00:58:58,690
We need to do an
emergency landing now!

976
00:58:58,692 --> 00:58:59,657
It's real!

977
00:58:59,659 --> 00:59:01,226
What's real?

978
00:59:01,228 --> 00:59:03,061
Look, we can't land until
the storm clears up, Alice!

979
00:59:03,063 --> 00:59:05,197
- You know that!
- We need to land it now, Jack!

980
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:06,998
Alice, what's going on?

981
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,101
It's ghosts!
The plane is haunted!

982
00:59:10,103 --> 00:59:12,938
Again with this?
Ryan?

983
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:14,306
Look, we're all tired.

984
00:59:14,308 --> 00:59:16,875
No, no, no, no.
You need to listen to me!

985
00:59:16,877 --> 00:59:19,512
You don't know
what we just saw.

986
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:21,079
This lady down in the aisle!

987
00:59:21,081 --> 00:59:23,181
You're the only ones
that didn't see it!

988
00:59:23,183 --> 00:59:25,250
Will you maybe sit down
for just a little bit?

989
00:59:25,252 --> 00:59:27,152
I'm getting worried about you.

990
00:59:27,154 --> 00:59:28,887
We're gonna be on the ground
in like 95 minutes or...

991
00:59:28,889 --> 00:59:30,389
No, listen! No!

992
00:59:30,391 --> 00:59:32,157
The longer that
we're up here,

993
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:33,625
the longer the lives
of everybody up here

994
00:59:33,627 --> 00:59:35,192
- is in jeopardy!
- Yeah?

995
00:59:35,194 --> 00:59:36,927
Where do you want me
to land, Alice, huh?

996
00:59:36,929 --> 00:59:38,396
Our coms are out.

997
00:59:38,398 --> 00:59:40,565
The storm's been on
us since takeoff.

998
00:59:40,567 --> 00:59:43,268
We're on our own
with nowhere to go!

999
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:45,637
The plane is haunted.
Would you listen to yourself?

1000
00:59:45,639 --> 00:59:49,174
We're not gonna land the plane
because you're superstitious!

1001
00:59:49,176 --> 00:59:52,645
I mean, why would ghosts
want to haunt this plane?

1002
00:59:52,647 --> 00:59:54,913
For revenge.

1003
00:59:54,915 --> 00:59:56,380
Excuse me?

1004
00:59:56,382 --> 00:59:57,581
What did you say?

1005
00:59:57,583 --> 00:59:59,219
Revenge!

1006
01:00:00,052 --> 01:00:03,755
Ryan, leave your belts on.

1007
01:00:03,757 --> 01:00:04,991
Ryan?

1008
01:00:05,926 --> 01:00:07,826
Ryan...

1009
01:00:07,828 --> 01:00:09,996
Revenge!

1010
01:00:12,766 --> 01:00:16,201
Ryan!

1011
01:00:16,203 --> 01:00:18,436
Stop!

1012
01:00:22,009 --> 01:00:24,309
Ryan, stop!

1013
01:00:24,311 --> 01:00:26,614
Stop!

1014
01:00:27,547 --> 01:00:29,815
What are you doing?

1015
01:00:35,054 --> 01:00:37,424
In your seats!

1016
01:00:44,998 --> 01:00:47,398
Ryan, what are you doing?
Stop!

1017
01:01:10,491 --> 01:01:12,059
Hey, hey, hey!

1018
01:01:13,826 --> 01:01:14,826
Get off of him!

1019
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:29,210
You okay?

1020
01:01:32,179 --> 01:01:33,978
You're not flying autopilot?

1021
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:36,014
No.

1022
01:01:36,016 --> 01:01:38,386
We lost it when
the plane lost power.

1023
01:01:39,953 --> 01:01:43,290
What the hell happened?

1024
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:19,994
I'm so sorry, Ryan.

1025
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,393
All right.

1026
01:02:22,395 --> 01:02:24,529
I don't know what
the hell we just saw.

1027
01:02:24,531 --> 01:02:26,197
But something's
definitely wrong.

1028
01:02:26,199 --> 01:02:29,203
We agree on that, right?

1029
01:02:33,406 --> 01:02:35,072
I mean, you said
there's something

1030
01:02:35,074 --> 01:02:36,940
physically wrong
with the plane, right?

1031
01:02:36,942 --> 01:02:39,677
No, not anything that's gonna
cause hallucinations or visions.

1032
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:42,614
I don't know what would cause
us to see the things we saw.

1033
01:02:42,616 --> 01:02:45,183
Okay, well, let's start
from the beginning.

1034
01:02:45,185 --> 01:02:48,320
So the storm started
soon after takeoff.

1035
01:02:48,322 --> 01:02:51,924
Precheck was fine.
Luggage was fine.

1036
01:02:51,926 --> 01:02:53,925
Mr. Peck in 25A...

1037
01:02:53,927 --> 01:02:55,360
Yeah, poor guy.

1038
01:02:55,362 --> 01:02:59,197
And Mr. Peck claimed that
he saw something unusual

1039
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:00,632
on the wing of the plane

1040
01:03:00,634 --> 01:03:03,201
and then he went to
the bathroom to cool off

1041
01:03:03,203 --> 01:03:05,203
and then he got spooked again.

1042
01:03:05,205 --> 01:03:07,873
Well, I know what I saw
in the bathroom was real.

1043
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:10,409
The woman in the bathroom,
she was in the mirror

1044
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:12,076
and she was
reaching out for me.

1045
01:03:12,078 --> 01:03:14,246
And then I fell
through the floor.

1046
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:15,980
I couldn't
get the door unlocked.

1047
01:03:15,982 --> 01:03:17,849
Me either.
I tried, but I couldn't.

1048
01:03:17,851 --> 01:03:21,386
It felt like it was being
held from the inside.

1049
01:03:21,388 --> 01:03:22,987
We checked it, though.

1050
01:03:22,989 --> 01:03:25,223
I mean, there's nothing
physically unusual about it.

1051
01:03:25,225 --> 01:03:27,324
Okay, then the plane
lost power and we fell.

1052
01:03:27,326 --> 01:03:30,596
And then the food
was spoiled somehow.

1053
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:33,768
I heard a woman scream
through my earbuds.

1054
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:38,603
Scream?

1055
01:03:38,605 --> 01:03:41,139
Scream what?

1056
01:03:41,141 --> 01:03:43,407
At first it was whispers.

1057
01:03:43,409 --> 01:03:45,643
Then it got louder.

1058
01:03:45,645 --> 01:03:50,882
It sounded like
she said, "Murder".

1059
01:03:50,884 --> 01:03:53,886
Well, then that's
when my phone stopped working.

1060
01:03:53,888 --> 01:03:55,253
Mine too.

1061
01:03:55,255 --> 01:03:57,621
I thought I was
the only one.

1062
01:03:57,623 --> 01:04:00,259
And there was something
really weird on my screen.

1063
01:04:00,261 --> 01:04:02,159
What was it?

1064
01:04:02,161 --> 01:04:03,462
A sonogram.

1065
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:04,962
A what?

1066
01:04:04,964 --> 01:04:07,465
You know, like when
you take pictures of babies

1067
01:04:07,467 --> 01:04:09,134
from a pregnant lady.

1068
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:11,270
That woman in the aisle.

1069
01:04:11,272 --> 01:04:14,505
And then Ryan going crazy
and attacking Jack.

1070
01:04:14,507 --> 01:04:17,442
Then the corpse
in the overhead bin.

1071
01:04:17,444 --> 01:04:19,978
And now someone's
written "murder"

1072
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:21,815
on the outside of your window.

1073
01:04:29,755 --> 01:04:32,456
Okay, so what are
we looking for?

1074
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:34,092
And where do we even start?

1075
01:04:34,094 --> 01:04:35,994
I mean, it has to be coming
from around here somewhere.

1076
01:04:35,996 --> 01:04:38,230
Well, it all started in
the front of the plane.

1077
01:04:38,232 --> 01:04:39,864
But I already checked
the bathroom, though.

1078
01:04:39,866 --> 01:04:41,800
And we've been up there
most of the flight.

1079
01:04:41,802 --> 01:04:44,735
That wouldn't explain the
phones or the overhead bins.

1080
01:04:44,737 --> 01:04:47,172
Or what happened
in the cockpit.

1081
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:48,505
We're so screwed.

1082
01:04:48,507 --> 01:04:50,574
No, we're not screwed,
guys, okay?

1083
01:04:50,576 --> 01:04:52,643
Listen, we just need
to find the source

1084
01:04:52,645 --> 01:04:55,615
to what the hell
is going on right now.

1085
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:57,751
Ryan?

1086
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:02,152
Where am I?

1087
01:05:02,154 --> 01:05:03,288
I can't move my hands.

1088
01:05:03,290 --> 01:05:04,523
It's on purpose, kid.

1089
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:07,259
- What happened?
- You attacked Jack.

1090
01:05:07,261 --> 01:05:09,061
What?

1091
01:05:09,063 --> 01:05:10,261
You got crazy eyes

1092
01:05:10,263 --> 01:05:11,395
and went straight
for the throat.

1093
01:05:11,397 --> 01:05:13,633
Why would I do that?

1094
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,335
All right, listen up.

1095
01:05:16,337 --> 01:05:19,605
I know it's been a crazy night
for all of us.

1096
01:05:19,607 --> 01:05:21,440
But there has to be
a perfectly reasonable

1097
01:05:21,442 --> 01:05:23,175
explanation for all of this!

1098
01:05:23,177 --> 01:05:25,677
There are only
so many places to look.

1099
01:05:25,679 --> 01:05:29,848
If not the cabin, the front
or the back, what else is there?

1100
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:33,083
Okay, well, we decided
that it started on the wing.

1101
01:05:33,085 --> 01:05:36,020
And now we have that
word written on his window...

1102
01:05:36,022 --> 01:05:38,290
Yeah, but we can't check
outside on the wing right now.

1103
01:05:38,292 --> 01:05:40,393
We're in the middle
of a flight.

1104
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:45,063
What about the manifest?

1105
01:05:45,065 --> 01:05:47,498
Is there anything onboard
that's out of the ordinary?

1106
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,366
Nothing that I know of.

1107
01:05:49,368 --> 01:05:51,703
No special packages
from museums?

1108
01:05:51,705 --> 01:05:53,304
No dead soldiers
being transferred

1109
01:05:53,306 --> 01:05:55,105
at home from Afghanistan?

1110
01:05:55,107 --> 01:05:56,206
Brandon?

1111
01:05:56,208 --> 01:05:57,842
What are you saying, man?

1112
01:05:57,844 --> 01:06:00,378
I mean, objects could
be conduits for spirits.

1113
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:01,478
Okay. Maybe there's
something on the plane

1114
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,215
that's traveling with it.

1115
01:06:03,217 --> 01:06:07,488
Okay, so if there's nothing
on the manifest, what do we do?

1116
01:06:10,456 --> 01:06:13,157
What were you saying?

1117
01:06:13,159 --> 01:06:15,192
When?

1118
01:06:15,194 --> 01:06:18,130
When you said you fell through
the floor, where did you go?

1119
01:06:18,132 --> 01:06:20,498
Um, I don't know.

1120
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:23,268
The cargo hold, I think.
Why?

1121
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:25,369
Because I saw that too.

1122
01:06:25,371 --> 01:06:27,438
When I fell back
against the seat

1123
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,877
and then I was
in the cargo hold.

1124
01:06:31,712 --> 01:06:33,714
Babe...

1125
01:06:34,815 --> 01:06:37,382
There was someone there.

1126
01:06:37,384 --> 01:06:40,554
And I don't...
And I don't know, but...

1127
01:06:41,654 --> 01:06:43,957
I felt like
they needed my help.

1128
01:06:47,261 --> 01:06:48,826
What... What are you saying?

1129
01:06:48,828 --> 01:06:52,730
There's something...
something happened.

1130
01:06:52,732 --> 01:06:55,333
Something bad.

1131
01:06:55,335 --> 01:06:57,268
We have to go down there.

1132
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:58,536
Babe...

1133
01:06:58,538 --> 01:07:01,271
If we are having visions
of the same thing

1134
01:07:01,273 --> 01:07:02,773
in the same location,

1135
01:07:02,775 --> 01:07:05,444
something is telling us
to go down there.

1136
01:07:05,446 --> 01:07:07,748
The luggage.

1137
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:18,322
Speak up.

1138
01:07:18,324 --> 01:07:19,523
The luggage.

1139
01:07:19,525 --> 01:07:22,092
I don't know what's going on.

1140
01:07:22,094 --> 01:07:25,295
But talking about it isn't
going to solve anything.

1141
01:07:25,297 --> 01:07:28,632
Like she said,
we need to go down there

1142
01:07:28,634 --> 01:07:30,770
and see for ourselves.

1143
01:07:33,473 --> 01:07:35,338
If I find out you
had something to do with this,

1144
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:37,007
you are in a
big world of hurt.

1145
01:07:37,009 --> 01:07:38,744
Do you understand that?

1146
01:07:38,746 --> 01:07:40,478
How? How?

1147
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,484
You tied me
and put me in a chair.

1148
01:07:45,384 --> 01:07:47,652
Cut him loose.

1149
01:07:47,654 --> 01:07:51,121
Yeah, cut him loose.

1150
01:07:51,123 --> 01:07:53,257
Any of us would have
freaked out in that bathroom.

1151
01:07:54,993 --> 01:07:57,527
Miss, would you happen
to have any scissors, please?

1152
01:07:57,529 --> 01:08:00,868
Yes. Thank you.

1153
01:08:11,677 --> 01:08:13,811
Don't make me regret this.

1154
01:08:13,813 --> 01:08:15,882
You won't.

1155
01:08:18,317 --> 01:08:20,053
Ah, God.

1156
01:08:22,356 --> 01:08:25,090
Okay.

1157
01:08:25,092 --> 01:08:27,024
Here's what's gonna
happen next.

1158
01:08:27,026 --> 01:08:28,792
You're all gonna go
back to your seats

1159
01:08:28,794 --> 01:08:30,394
and I'm gonna go down
to the cargo area

1160
01:08:30,396 --> 01:08:31,996
and check it out for myself.

1161
01:08:31,998 --> 01:08:34,966
I'm sorry. Sorry, guys.
No one can go down to cargo.

1162
01:08:34,968 --> 01:08:36,967
Do you want this to come
to an end or not?

1163
01:08:36,969 --> 01:08:39,938
Because I gotta cover
all my bases here.

1164
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:41,473
- I'm going with you.
- Dani...

1165
01:08:41,475 --> 01:08:43,574
No, you are not going with me.

1166
01:08:43,576 --> 01:08:48,445
No! It was speaking to me!
I saw it!

1167
01:08:48,447 --> 01:08:50,314
I'm not gonna sit
up here and wait

1168
01:08:50,316 --> 01:08:51,616
for someone else
to figure it out!

1169
01:08:51,618 --> 01:08:53,451
I'm going!

1170
01:08:53,453 --> 01:08:54,652
No, you're not going!

1171
01:08:54,654 --> 01:08:56,787
Look, I'm going too.

1172
01:08:56,789 --> 01:08:58,723
I didn't travel this far
to get back to my wife

1173
01:08:58,725 --> 01:09:01,024
and my kid to
not get home now.

1174
01:09:01,026 --> 01:09:02,792
Now if getting down
there finding out

1175
01:09:02,794 --> 01:09:04,628
what's going on is going
to help us all get home,

1176
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:06,564
then I'm gonna help you.
I have your six, man.

1177
01:09:06,566 --> 01:09:07,998
I appreciate that.

1178
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,466
But I'm doing
my job right now

1179
01:09:09,468 --> 01:09:11,469
and I'm going down alone!

1180
01:09:11,471 --> 01:09:13,837
Dani, you stay here.

1181
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:16,140
I'm gonna go with the marshal.

1182
01:09:16,142 --> 01:09:17,542
Nobody's coming with...

1183
01:09:17,544 --> 01:09:20,447
Please stop!
Just follow me.

1184
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:41,966
You guys are gonna
have to be quick.

1185
01:09:41,968 --> 01:09:43,534
I can't see anything
down there.

1186
01:09:43,536 --> 01:09:45,436
That light won't
be strong enough.

1187
01:09:45,438 --> 01:09:47,106
Hang tight.

1188
01:09:48,508 --> 01:09:50,442
That one will.

1189
01:09:50,444 --> 01:09:51,475
There we go.

1190
01:09:53,445 --> 01:09:54,679
What is that?

1191
01:09:54,681 --> 01:09:57,584
Sounds like a baby.

1192
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:10,060
Oh!

1193
01:10:10,062 --> 01:10:11,729
Guys, what is happening?

1194
01:10:11,731 --> 01:10:14,767
Sorry! I thought I saw
something, but it's gone.

1195
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:17,502
This is a nightmare.

1196
01:10:17,504 --> 01:10:18,802
Oh!

1197
01:10:18,804 --> 01:10:20,572
- You okay?
- You okay?

1198
01:10:26,512 --> 01:10:27,947
This is bad.

1199
01:10:41,861 --> 01:10:43,996
Oh...

1200
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:53,438
It's leading to that bag.

1201
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,605
Austin, do you want
to grab that?

1202
01:10:54,607 --> 01:10:57,143
Yeah, sure.

1203
01:11:02,348 --> 01:11:03,950
Guys?

1204
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:06,551
What are they?

1205
01:11:06,553 --> 01:11:08,185
- Her!
- Who?

1206
01:11:08,187 --> 01:11:11,122
The overhead bin!
In the overhead bin!

1207
01:11:11,124 --> 01:11:13,527
That's blood.

1208
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:19,662
Souvenirs.

1209
01:11:19,664 --> 01:11:21,465
Typical serial killer.

1210
01:11:21,467 --> 01:11:23,435
Holy shit!

1211
01:11:23,437 --> 01:11:26,337
What, what?

1212
01:11:26,339 --> 01:11:27,639
It would be her.

1213
01:11:27,641 --> 01:11:29,440
Are they all here?

1214
01:11:29,442 --> 01:11:31,911
Where's the woman that ran
towards us and disappeared?

1215
01:11:33,045 --> 01:11:35,512
Holy Mary Mother of God,
that's her.

1216
01:11:35,514 --> 01:11:36,747
There.

1217
01:11:36,749 --> 01:11:38,748
This bag belongs
to someone on the plane?

1218
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:42,185
A killer?
Whose bag is this?

1219
01:11:42,187 --> 01:11:44,156
- That's easy to figure out.
- Find out.

1220
01:11:50,664 --> 01:11:52,633
No way.

1221
01:12:39,212 --> 01:12:41,211
Captain, I'm gonna have
to speak with you

1222
01:12:41,213 --> 01:12:42,613
about what's been
going on tonight.

1223
01:12:44,182 --> 01:12:46,984
No disrespect, Marshal.
But can we do this another time?

1224
01:12:46,986 --> 01:12:48,685
I don't know
if you've noticed,

1225
01:12:48,687 --> 01:12:50,387
but I'm flying this
plane by myself

1226
01:12:50,389 --> 01:12:52,256
and we haven't really been
having a great night.

1227
01:12:52,258 --> 01:12:56,661
You sure you wanna
do this right here?

1228
01:12:56,663 --> 01:12:57,929
Do what?

1229
01:12:57,931 --> 01:13:01,099
Talk about the women
you've murdered.

1230
01:13:01,101 --> 01:13:02,966
Murdered?

1231
01:13:04,704 --> 01:13:07,204
Murdered?
You serious?

1232
01:13:07,206 --> 01:13:08,739
Cut the bullshit!

1233
01:13:08,741 --> 01:13:10,408
Whoa!
You can't talk to me like that!

1234
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:13,077
Look, Marshal, whatever
you think's going on,

1235
01:13:13,079 --> 01:13:15,578
we can't have this many
people in the cockpit.

1236
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:16,948
I'm sure you know protocol.

1237
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:18,683
I'm afraid I'm not
gonna be able

1238
01:13:18,685 --> 01:13:20,717
to follow protocol
right now, Captain.

1239
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:22,153
Neither are they.

1240
01:13:22,155 --> 01:13:26,357
What is this?
We're almost on the ground.

1241
01:13:26,359 --> 01:13:28,525
Whatever it is can wait
till we're on the ground.

1242
01:13:28,527 --> 01:13:29,859
No, it can't wait.

1243
01:13:29,861 --> 01:13:31,528
We're talking about
this right now!

1244
01:13:31,530 --> 01:13:34,064
Where did you get these?
What did you do to her?

1245
01:13:34,066 --> 01:13:36,667
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1246
01:13:36,669 --> 01:13:38,168
What is this?

1247
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:39,670
Good God!
What's wrong with you people?

1248
01:13:39,672 --> 01:13:41,171
I don't know who this woman is.

1249
01:13:41,173 --> 01:13:42,741
Don't lie to me!
What did you do to her?

1250
01:13:42,743 --> 01:13:44,875
What did you do to her baby?

1251
01:13:44,877 --> 01:13:46,476
It's funny how the women
in these photographs

1252
01:13:46,478 --> 01:13:47,810
were the same women
causing all the problems

1253
01:13:47,812 --> 01:13:49,480
on this plane tonight.

1254
01:13:49,482 --> 01:13:52,984
Also very funny how all the
pictures ended up in your bag.

1255
01:13:52,986 --> 01:13:54,254
Jack....

1256
01:13:55,021 --> 01:13:56,420
Captain.

1257
01:13:56,422 --> 01:14:00,724
I don't... look, these
aren't my... oh, come on!

1258
01:14:00,726 --> 01:14:03,760
Tell the truth!

1259
01:14:03,762 --> 01:14:06,667
Captain?

1260
01:14:19,212 --> 01:14:21,244
- Cut me loose!
- What?

1261
01:14:21,246 --> 01:14:22,846
Don't do it!

1262
01:14:22,848 --> 01:14:23,881
We need somebody to fly
the plane, please!

1263
01:14:23,883 --> 01:14:26,386
Cut me loose!

1264
01:14:29,755 --> 01:14:31,087
Trust me!

1265
01:14:31,089 --> 01:14:33,558
Without a pilot,
we're gonna die!

1266
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,092
Hurry!

1267
01:14:36,094 --> 01:14:38,397
Revenge!

1268
01:14:42,735 --> 01:14:45,105
Revenge!

1269
01:14:46,472 --> 01:14:47,973
Hurry!

1270
01:14:50,743 --> 01:14:53,110
Please!

1271
01:14:53,112 --> 01:14:55,347
Hurry!

1272
01:14:59,584 --> 01:15:02,054
Revenge!

1273
01:15:07,794 --> 01:15:11,031
Revenge!

1274
01:15:21,106 --> 01:15:23,442
Revenge!

1275
01:15:28,781 --> 01:15:30,784
Move!

1276
01:15:34,053 --> 01:15:38,989
Revenge!
Revenge!

1277
01:15:38,991 --> 01:15:42,795
Murderer!
Revenge!

1278
01:15:56,810 --> 01:15:58,210
You know who I am?

1279
01:16:01,312 --> 01:16:04,484
Get your hands off me!
Christ!

1280
01:16:17,797 --> 01:16:20,598
Dani? Baby?

1281
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,102
Hey...

1282
01:16:29,941 --> 01:16:31,544
Come on...

1283
01:16:32,512 --> 01:16:33,980
Come on.

1284
01:16:35,882 --> 01:16:38,084
What happened?

1285
01:16:47,959 --> 01:16:49,092
I didn't...

1286
01:16:49,094 --> 01:16:51,932
I didn't do it, I swear.

1287
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,835
Save it.

1288
01:17:17,923 --> 01:17:19,422
What did you do?

1289
01:17:19,424 --> 01:17:21,158
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1290
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,529
Let's get her
to her chair.

1291
01:17:25,297 --> 01:17:27,997
- Can you...
- Yeah, I got her.

1292
01:17:27,999 --> 01:17:31,368
I got you.
Come on, babe.

1293
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:33,069
Hey, hey.

1294
01:17:33,071 --> 01:17:34,337
Tell me what you did!

1295
01:17:34,339 --> 01:17:36,442
I didn't do anything!

1296
01:17:40,079 --> 01:17:41,511
You tell me what
you did right now

1297
01:17:41,513 --> 01:17:43,346
or I will end you
where you sit.

1298
01:17:43,348 --> 01:17:46,951
Look, nothing
I did matters, okay?

1299
01:17:46,953 --> 01:17:48,086
Austin!

1300
01:17:48,088 --> 01:17:49,385
Okay?
None of it matters.

1301
01:17:49,387 --> 01:17:51,020
You're gonna get
everyone killed!

1302
01:17:51,022 --> 01:17:53,224
Wake up, honey,
come on, babe?

1303
01:17:53,226 --> 01:17:53,991
Come on.

1304
01:17:53,993 --> 01:17:56,996
No, not everyone.

1305
01:17:58,798 --> 01:18:00,467
Just you.

1306
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:25,292
Oh, my God.

1307
01:18:28,928 --> 01:18:31,261
No!

1308
01:18:31,263 --> 01:18:32,965
No!

1309
01:18:38,137 --> 01:18:41,942
Stop. Please stop.

1310
01:18:47,045 --> 01:18:48,679
No, no, no, no!

1311
01:18:48,681 --> 01:18:50,314
It's not my fault!
It's not my fault!

1312
01:18:50,316 --> 01:18:51,982
I didn't mean it the first time!

1313
01:18:51,984 --> 01:18:53,317
It was an accident!

1314
01:18:53,319 --> 01:18:55,152
She liked it rough, you know.

1315
01:18:55,154 --> 01:18:56,987
I did too,
so I thought it was okay!

1316
01:18:56,989 --> 01:18:59,323
We were role-playing!

1317
01:18:59,325 --> 01:19:02,726
And I guess I just got
a little too into it!

1318
01:19:02,728 --> 01:19:04,228
I was scared the first time!

1319
01:19:04,230 --> 01:19:08,131
I felt guilty,
but deep down inside.

1320
01:19:08,133 --> 01:19:09,367
I liked it.
I loved it.

1321
01:19:09,369 --> 01:19:12,235
I loved watching
the expiration light

1322
01:19:12,237 --> 01:19:14,572
blink and then fade.

1323
01:19:14,574 --> 01:19:16,573
It became an urge.
A need.

1324
01:19:16,575 --> 01:19:19,076
Then it became me.

1325
01:19:19,078 --> 01:19:20,210
I realized I could
just fly away

1326
01:19:20,212 --> 01:19:21,711
and no one would know.

1327
01:19:21,713 --> 01:19:23,547
And I didn't know how to stop!
I just...

1328
01:19:23,549 --> 01:19:27,018
Oh God, I'm so sorry, please!

1329
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:29,188
I'm so sorry! I just...

1330
01:19:30,222 --> 01:19:34,424
I don't know how to stop it!

1331
01:19:34,426 --> 01:19:38,095
Forgive me.
Please forgive me.

1332
01:19:38,097 --> 01:19:39,564
I'll do anything.

1333
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:44,571
No!

1334
01:19:53,111 --> 01:19:55,481
No!

1335
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,031
Brandon!

1336
01:20:18,437 --> 01:20:20,073
No!

1337
01:20:42,527 --> 01:20:43,993
Come here!

1338
01:20:43,995 --> 01:20:45,162
No!

1339
01:20:45,164 --> 01:20:47,930
This is all your fault!

1340
01:20:50,136 --> 01:20:51,635
Bitch!

1341
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:11,356
Don't...

1342
01:21:43,021 --> 01:21:44,490
No!

1343
01:21:52,197 --> 01:21:54,265
No!

1344
01:21:54,267 --> 01:21:56,169
No!

1345
01:22:16,121 --> 01:22:17,220
No, no!

1346
01:22:30,236 --> 01:22:33,069
Everybody, please hang on!

1347
01:22:50,722 --> 01:22:54,257
JFK Center, PAN-US 57!
Do you copy?

1348
01:22:54,259 --> 01:22:55,928
Damn it!

1349
01:23:07,572 --> 01:23:09,542
Hang on!

1350
01:23:19,752 --> 01:23:23,423
Brace!
Brace, brace, brace!

1351
01:23:30,762 --> 01:23:33,029
- Brandon!
- I got you!

1352
01:23:33,031 --> 01:23:34,633
I got you!

1353
01:23:44,611 --> 01:23:46,412
Shit.

1354
01:23:48,146 --> 01:23:51,583
We're coming in hot!
Hold on!

1355
01:23:55,654 --> 01:23:59,288
Come on, baby,
come on, come on!

1356
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:00,824
Come on, come on.

1357
01:24:00,826 --> 01:24:03,359
Got this...

1358
01:24:03,361 --> 01:24:05,632
Everyone brace for impact!

1359
01:24:45,538 --> 01:24:48,805
Are you okay?
You okay?

1360
01:25:00,085 --> 01:25:01,721
You okay?

1361
01:25:11,096 --> 01:25:13,799
We're good back here.

1362
01:25:14,767 --> 01:25:16,736
Oh my God.

1363
01:25:20,606 --> 01:25:23,607
It's okay, it's okay.

1364
01:25:23,609 --> 01:25:27,210
Hey, hey, it's okay.
I got you.

1365
01:25:27,212 --> 01:25:28,714
I got you.

1366
01:25:29,749 --> 01:25:31,415
Ryan?

1367
01:25:31,417 --> 01:25:34,419
Ryan, okay.

1368
01:25:55,438 --> 01:26:00,438
