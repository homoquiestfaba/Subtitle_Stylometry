1
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:17,212
Hey, Wally? Take a look at these,
will you? I've made some changes.

2
00:00:35,332 --> 00:00:38,164
<i>Hi. Leave a message at the beep
and we'll get back to you.</i>

3
00:00:39,635 --> 00:00:40,604
<i>Hi, honey. It's me.</i>

4
00:00:41,105 --> 00:00:43,198
Too bad you're going away
this weekend. I miss you already.

5
00:00:43,341 --> 00:00:45,676
<i>But I'll tell you what.
Why don't I knock off early...</i>

6
00:00:45,676 --> 00:00:47,905
<i>and I come home for lunch
and see you off, okay?</i>

7
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:49,203
<i>Love you.</i>

8
00:00:50,982 --> 00:00:52,381
Terrific.

9
00:00:53,885 --> 00:00:57,285
-Boss, you've got a visitor.
-Clint.

10
00:00:57,621 --> 00:00:59,179
Hope you don't mind
me popping in like this.

11
00:00:59,322 --> 00:01:01,324
Oh, no.
I'm always glad to see you.

12
00:01:01,324 --> 00:01:03,794
Wally, give us
a couple of minutes, will you?

13
00:01:03,794 --> 00:01:05,522
-Have a seat.
-Thanks.

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,341
Shut up.

15
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:06,379
Problem, sheriff?

16
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,316
There ain't but two people in this
whole town worth going fishing with.

17
00:02:10,492 --> 00:02:12,824
I'm looking at one and
you're looking at the other one.

18
00:02:13,028 --> 00:02:15,665
-What you're weekend like?
-I'm wide open.

19
00:02:15,665 --> 00:02:18,567
Joanna's heading to the city today.
Spending the night with a girlfriend.

20
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:21,370
-Going shopping tomorrow.
-Well, we'll make the night too.

21
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,137
Let's get some fishing poles
and sleeping bags...

22
00:02:23,137 --> 00:02:25,643
-and catch some trouts.
-You got it.

23
00:02:25,643 --> 00:02:27,633
I'll pick you up at five.

24
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:29,746
Big hand is on the twelve,
little hand is on the five.

25
00:02:29,746 --> 00:02:31,008
You can't miss it.

26
00:02:34,617 --> 00:02:36,312
Slow it down!

27
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:55,904
What are you doing in there, Duke?
Nobody let you out?

28
00:02:58,307 --> 00:03:00,138
Come here. Come here.

29
00:03:02,845 --> 00:03:04,642
Yeah. Come on. Come on.

30
00:03:08,183 --> 00:03:10,151
Go get it. Go get it.

31
00:03:11,286 --> 00:03:13,777
That's it.
Stay out of those flowers.

32
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,321
<i>Honey, I'm home!</i>

33
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:18,955
Honey?

34
00:03:20,897 --> 00:03:23,033
-Did you get my message?
-Yes...

35
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:24,500
but I have doctor
appointment at two...

36
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,568
and then I'm
meeting Maggie. And if...

37
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:29,902
If I don't head into the city now,
I'll never make it, so...

38
00:03:29,973 --> 00:03:33,840
Well, guess I'll just
have to fend for myself.

39
00:03:34,176 --> 00:03:35,700
I guess so.

40
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:37,344
Oh, that's okay.

41
00:03:38,548 --> 00:03:42,984
But if you try to call me tonight
and I'm not here...

42
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,610
I want you to know the truth.

43
00:03:48,591 --> 00:03:50,558
Sam and I are going fishing.

44
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,734
Yeah, the knife's been invented.

45
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:10,213
You'll never guess
who came by again today.

46
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:13,375
Bill Scorby.
Made another offer.

47
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:17,319
A million and a half.

48
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:19,686
Well, he's persistent.
I'll say that about him.

49
00:04:20,056 --> 00:04:23,320
If he wasn't so damn sleazy,
I would kind of find it flattering.

50
00:04:24,993 --> 00:04:28,190
It's an awful lot of money,
sweetheart. I mean...

51
00:04:28,464 --> 00:04:30,455
maybe we should consider it.

52
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:34,167
I would sooner sell
the business to the dog.

53
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:38,206
Besides, who's looking
for a buyer?

54
00:04:38,206 --> 00:04:39,907
What would we do
if we sold the business?

55
00:04:39,907 --> 00:04:42,343
We'll get the hell out of here.
We can go back to New York.

56
00:04:42,343 --> 00:04:44,780
-You ever think about that?
-Joanna.

57
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,415
You ever think about
taking your old job back?

58
00:04:47,415 --> 00:04:49,951
-Wait a second.
-Do you ever think about me?

59
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:52,420
I have done nothing
but to think about you.

60
00:04:54,356 --> 00:04:56,858
Do you think I left you alone
in New York for five summers...

61
00:04:56,858 --> 00:04:59,559
and traveled two thousand miles
so I can come here and fish?

62
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:01,587
No. I've built this house for us.

63
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:04,932
This was our
dream house, remember?

64
00:05:05,534 --> 00:05:08,603
Away from all that craziness.
Quiet, fresh air.

65
00:05:08,603 --> 00:05:10,539
A place where we could
raise our kids.

66
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:12,374
Clint, we've been trying
for over an year and a half...

67
00:05:12,374 --> 00:05:13,976
and I'm still not pregnant.

68
00:05:13,976 --> 00:05:16,612
We'll just keep trying.
It will happen.

69
00:05:16,612 --> 00:05:20,149
-I want out of here.
-Joanna, we had an agreement.

70
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:22,640
You said you would
give this town a chance.

71
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:25,087
Come on, this is where I grew up.
This is my home.

72
00:05:25,087 --> 00:05:26,883
I want this to be our home.

73
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:30,419
I've built this house
because I love you.

74
00:05:30,992 --> 00:05:33,791
This? You know what this is?

75
00:05:34,162 --> 00:05:36,960
One big maze. And I'm the rat.

76
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,768
Don't make it sound
like I dragged you here.

77
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:43,293
Well, that's how it feels,
sweetheart.

78
00:05:45,206 --> 00:05:46,935
I have to go.

79
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:50,472
Have a fun date.

80
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:22,602
-We don't do this enough anymore.
-No, we don't.

81
00:06:28,316 --> 00:06:30,783
So, how are things
on the home front?

82
00:06:33,053 --> 00:06:34,784
They're okay.

83
00:06:35,023 --> 00:06:37,820
Forget I asked.
It's none of my business.

84
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:41,122
Well, you know Joanna.

85
00:06:42,296 --> 00:06:44,559
She grew up in the city.

86
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:48,397
So the transition hasn't been
easy for her, but she's trying.

87
00:06:49,437 --> 00:06:51,200
That's enough for now.

88
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:53,972
-This answer your question?
-Yeap.

89
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:58,501
I can't tell you how surprise
we were to see you come back.

90
00:06:59,113 --> 00:07:01,173
-How glad we were.
-Yeah, sure.

91
00:07:01,315 --> 00:07:03,442
-I mean it.
-Well...

92
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:05,785
New York city? Ten years?

93
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:08,689
The only wood I get my hands on
was a pencil between my fingers.

94
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:10,350
I had to come back.

95
00:07:14,694 --> 00:07:16,595
She'll come around, Sam.

96
00:07:17,398 --> 00:07:20,424
-I know she will.
-I hope so.

97
00:07:26,974 --> 00:07:28,576
You and me.

98
00:07:28,576 --> 00:07:33,774
Together we'll own 20% of the most
exclusive clinic on Beverly Hills.

99
00:07:35,282 --> 00:07:37,684
You'll be on
a first name basis...

100
00:07:38,453 --> 00:07:43,219
with every movie star,
producers and all in town.

101
00:07:44,824 --> 00:07:47,795
All of them with
substance abuse problems.

102
00:07:48,497 --> 00:07:53,126
All of them willing to pay me
500 bucks for an office visit.

103
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:01,641
I'll leave him.
I'll get a divorce.

104
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:06,709
Joanna, we're looking at
a year in court.

105
00:08:07,113 --> 00:08:08,945
Maybe more.

106
00:08:09,116 --> 00:08:11,640
And who is to say
what you'll end up with.

107
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:16,523
This clinic is a cash machine
just waiting for us to plug into it.

108
00:08:16,523 --> 00:08:20,220
You want that as much as I do.
I know you do.

109
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:22,392
Cort, please.

110
00:08:22,862 --> 00:08:26,059
Look, maybe
you loved Clint once...

111
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:28,299
but you end up there.

112
00:08:29,368 --> 00:08:32,173
Right in that county in USA,
sitting in the front porch...

113
00:08:32,173 --> 00:08:34,141
watching the peasants puke.

114
00:08:35,343 --> 00:08:38,243
That's not
what you deserve, is it?

115
00:08:41,115 --> 00:08:42,639
No.

116
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:46,408
I can make this happen.

117
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,152
All it takes is money.
And it's easier than you think.

118
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:54,885
-How easy?
-Did you enjoy your dinner tonight?

119
00:08:57,764 --> 00:08:59,287
Yes.

120
00:08:59,398 --> 00:09:02,665
Did you notice anything
missing in the aquarium?

121
00:09:06,072 --> 00:09:07,595
We ate one of those?

122
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,537
In the Orient,
these are a great delicacy.

123
00:09:10,677 --> 00:09:13,237
Extremely difficult to prepare.

124
00:09:13,346 --> 00:09:17,679
If I've made the tiniest slip, we
wouldn't be alive to talk about it.

125
00:09:18,317 --> 00:09:22,619
I extracted this from
the ovaries of the fish we ate.

126
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:25,323
This it a toxin.

127
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:31,824
-How does it work?
-The recipient has a cardiac arrest.

128
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,367
Quick and clean.

129
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:37,737
It's almost tasteless.
You can...

130
00:09:37,872 --> 00:09:42,171
You can put it in his food.
Put in the drink. Whatever.

131
00:09:42,942 --> 00:09:47,845
I never knew a murder
could be so pure.

132
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:49,944
Pure.

133
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,712
I like that.

134
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:04,827
Make sure he takes all of it.

135
00:10:04,963 --> 00:10:07,762
Understand? All of it.

136
00:10:12,204 --> 00:10:14,105
I can't do this.

137
00:10:14,475 --> 00:10:16,500
You're asking too much. I...

138
00:10:16,811 --> 00:10:20,075
-I won't.
-You don't mean that.

139
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:23,440
I'm sorry.

140
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:37,460
So am I. I only wanted
what was best for you, Joanna.

141
00:10:39,832 --> 00:10:44,736
-Will I see you again?
-I don't...

142
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:47,773
think that would be fair.
To either of us.

143
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,331
Do you?

144
00:10:51,377 --> 00:10:52,741
No.

145
00:10:53,178 --> 00:10:57,410
I hope it all works out
for you, Joanna. I really do.

146
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:03,444
Okay.

147
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,588
Okay.

148
00:11:58,645 --> 00:12:00,909
Honey, I'm home.

149
00:12:05,952 --> 00:12:08,785
<i>-Joanna?
-Upstairs.</i>

150
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:15,160
Honey, you have to see
all these trout.

151
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,219
Talking dinner for days.

152
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:31,100
Dinner can wait, can't it?

153
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,971
Yeah, I think so.

154
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,295
I love you.

155
00:13:03,475 --> 00:13:08,002
Well, here I was ready to
role up my sleeves.

156
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:11,650
-Clean some fish.
-I thought we had steak tonight.

157
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,277
I had fish last night.

158
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,486
Do you need any help?

159
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:19,318
-No?
-No, that's okay.

160
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,495
-Well, I'll be at the workshop.
-Okay.

161
00:15:12,603 --> 00:15:13,899
It's about time...

162
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:16,474
-You scared me.
-I'm sorry.

163
00:15:16,474 --> 00:15:18,031
I did it again.

164
00:15:33,824 --> 00:15:37,090
Now, you didn't cook
all this food just for me.

165
00:15:39,463 --> 00:15:42,364
I don't know where
my appetite went.

166
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:50,173
-I want to propose a toast.
-What?

167
00:15:50,274 --> 00:15:51,605
A toast.

168
00:15:54,043 --> 00:15:58,382
Sweetheart, you know,
I had some wine earlier and I...

169
00:15:58,382 --> 00:16:00,714
I'm just not feeling very well.

170
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:03,719
Joanna, just toast with me.
Please.

171
00:16:06,122 --> 00:16:07,384
Come on.

172
00:16:08,626 --> 00:16:09,922
Yeah.

173
00:16:14,664 --> 00:16:16,632
To you, Joanna.

174
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,403
Everytime I look at you...

175
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:23,233
I don't know how I got so lucky.

176
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,443
Sweetheart.

177
00:16:31,848 --> 00:16:34,409
Honey, please.
You're hurting me.

178
00:16:41,157 --> 00:16:42,318
Joanna...

179
00:17:02,912 --> 00:17:05,005
Joanna, help me.

180
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,248
Joanna...

181
00:17:09,886 --> 00:17:10,945
No!

182
00:17:17,594 --> 00:17:18,926
Die.

183
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,422
Why don't you just die?

184
00:17:24,734 --> 00:17:28,295
Damn you, die! Die!

185
00:17:58,434 --> 00:18:00,424
<i>-Hello?
-It's me.</i>

186
00:18:01,236 --> 00:18:03,467
<i>-Joanna?
-It's done.</i>

187
00:18:04,341 --> 00:18:07,400
<i>-What?
-It's done.</i>

188
00:18:08,678 --> 00:18:12,180
<i>I see. Now, listen,
just stay calm.</i>

189
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,309
<i>You've already done
the right thing.</i>

190
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,610
<i>-What is that?
-You called your doctor.</i>

191
00:18:19,756 --> 00:18:21,655
<i>I'll take it from here.</i>

192
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:25,559
Alright.

193
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,774
Don't seem right a man
this prime having a heart attack.

194
00:19:11,774 --> 00:19:15,510
-I don't understand it.
-A case like this is always a chock.

195
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,579
But they happen
more often than you know.

196
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:19,514
A man as healthy...

197
00:19:21,017 --> 00:19:24,452
A man as seemingly healthy...

198
00:19:24,553 --> 00:19:28,285
as Mr. Goodman seldom
exhibit symptoms beforehand.

199
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:35,762
This is such a waste.

200
00:19:38,234 --> 00:19:40,326
-Look.
-What?

201
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:46,334
The dog. Can't somebody
please make that dog shut up?

202
00:19:47,077 --> 00:19:49,567
He's just upset
like all of us, Joanna.

203
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:53,045
I'll take him of your hands
if you like. Until after...

204
00:19:53,815 --> 00:19:55,477
Until things settle down.

205
00:19:56,718 --> 00:19:58,209
Coroner.

206
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:02,990
What about an autopsy?

207
00:20:03,592 --> 00:20:08,895
I don't think that's necessary,
but I'll defer to the coroner.

208
00:20:09,331 --> 00:20:13,132
-I see no reason for it, Sam.
-Alright.

209
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,545
-Sheriff.
-What?

210
00:20:23,545 --> 00:20:26,775
-Death certificate.
-We're just about done here, Sam.

211
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:28,246
Alright.

212
00:20:29,684 --> 00:20:30,912
Thanks.

213
00:20:33,221 --> 00:20:37,452
-I'm truly sorry about this, Joanna.
-Thank you, Sam. That means a lot.

214
00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:48,136
You're trying to give me
a heart attack too?

215
00:20:48,136 --> 00:20:50,503
Made it all sound
so neat and simple!

216
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:52,974
-Joanna, keep your voice down.
-Well, it wasn't!

217
00:20:52,974 --> 00:20:55,310
It took forever. It was horrible.
You should've seen him.

218
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,913
Look, Joanna, this is a very
tense moment for the both of us...

219
00:20:58,913 --> 00:21:01,145
but let's just
get a grip here, alright?

220
00:21:01,217 --> 00:21:03,118
We can't afford
to get sloopy now.

221
00:21:03,118 --> 00:21:05,754
We have a ways to go
before we're out of the woods.

222
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:09,891
-It's over. It's done.
-You have business arrangements.

223
00:21:09,891 --> 00:21:13,762
-You have a funeral. You have a wake.
-No. No wake.

224
00:21:13,762 --> 00:21:16,229
-Joanna...
-Not after what I've been through.

225
00:21:22,437 --> 00:21:23,926
You're gonna be alright?

226
00:21:24,572 --> 00:21:26,767
Yeah, fine. Thanks, doctor.

227
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,289
You've got to relax.
You've got to keep it together.

228
00:21:43,492 --> 00:21:45,483
And you've got to think straight.

229
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:47,790
You understand that?

230
00:21:49,264 --> 00:21:53,496
I love you, baby. And we'll get
through this somehow, okay?

231
00:21:56,338 --> 00:21:58,539
And if there's anything else
that you need, Ms. Goodman.

232
00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:00,674
Anything at all.
Fell free to call me.

233
00:22:00,674 --> 00:22:02,810
Anytime of the day or night.
That's what I'm here for.

234
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,836
-Thank you, doctor.
-You're very welcome.

235
00:22:12,888 --> 00:22:15,257
Joanna, Helen and I
are here for you.

236
00:22:15,257 --> 00:22:17,690
Anything you need. Alright?

237
00:22:18,292 --> 00:22:19,850
Thank you, Sam.

238
00:22:26,168 --> 00:22:29,762
That girl is very destroyed.
She's devastated.

239
00:22:31,005 --> 00:22:33,307
I thought you handled yourself
very well in there.

240
00:22:33,307 --> 00:22:36,711
-If you don't mind my saying so.
-Not at all. Thanks.

241
00:22:36,711 --> 00:22:38,769
-Alright. Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

242
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,688
Stop. I mean it now.
Come on, Duke.

243
00:23:01,835 --> 00:23:03,166
Come on.

244
00:23:05,372 --> 00:23:07,203
Come on, this way. Right here.

245
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:16,409
Sam, it late. Come to bed.

246
00:23:17,084 --> 00:23:18,609
In a minute.

247
00:23:20,422 --> 00:23:22,389
You shouldn't be
drinking beer at this hour.

248
00:23:22,389 --> 00:23:24,091
You'll be in and out the bed
through all night long.

249
00:23:24,091 --> 00:23:26,788
I'm only drinking a half a bottle.
That'll help me sleep.

250
00:23:27,562 --> 00:23:30,155
-Split it with me.
-I'll take a sip.

251
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:31,796
Take two.

252
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:37,571
I was just thinking about the way
he was after his parents died.

253
00:23:38,272 --> 00:23:40,763
Damned pimply kid
was always in trouble.

254
00:23:41,075 --> 00:23:43,941
-You set him straight.
-I sure did.

255
00:23:44,544 --> 00:23:47,036
I put a fear of God
into that boy.

256
00:23:49,016 --> 00:23:51,347
Turned out to be
a fine young man.

257
00:23:54,455 --> 00:23:57,992
Sometimes life just comes along and
kicks you when you don't expect it.

258
00:23:57,992 --> 00:24:00,050
And just knocks the wind
right out of you.

259
00:24:04,764 --> 00:24:08,099
I just can't believe
that he's gone.

260
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:49,668
Well, there he is.
Bagged and tagged.

261
00:24:50,344 --> 00:24:52,607
Now he's gotta be
pumped and dumped.

262
00:24:53,646 --> 00:24:55,443
First day jitters?

263
00:24:55,948 --> 00:24:57,883
You'll get used to it.

264
00:24:57,883 --> 00:24:59,954
After a while,
they all look the same.

265
00:24:59,954 --> 00:25:01,386
Stiff.

266
00:25:01,522 --> 00:25:03,387
Well, help me peel it.

267
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,396
Quintan Funeral Home.
Quintan speaking.

268
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,232
Yes, Dr. Van Owen.
How can I be of service?

269
00:25:20,407 --> 00:25:22,102
Are you sure?

270
00:25:22,343 --> 00:25:24,544
People often regret
that decision later.

271
00:25:24,544 --> 00:25:27,814
Be that as it may.
Ms. Goodman is very specific.

272
00:25:27,814 --> 00:25:29,645
She does not want a wake.

273
00:25:29,982 --> 00:25:32,919
Now, first, you've got
to get familiar with the tools.

274
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:36,355
Now, this here, little sharp knife.
This is a scalpel.

275
00:25:38,424 --> 00:25:43,262
Now, over here, we have
a pourer fluid injection system.

276
00:25:43,262 --> 00:25:45,822
Manufactured in Urbana, Illinois.

277
00:25:46,132 --> 00:25:49,267
Now this little baby pumps the
embalming fluid into these holes.

278
00:25:49,267 --> 00:25:50,461
Right here.

279
00:25:51,002 --> 00:25:54,531
While we drain the blood out
through this hose right here.

280
00:25:55,743 --> 00:25:58,040
You ever changed
the oil in your car?

281
00:25:58,311 --> 00:26:00,040
Same thing.

282
00:26:20,699 --> 00:26:22,861
Now, stay with me, boy.

283
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:27,137
The big artery is right here.

284
00:26:27,974 --> 00:26:29,634
Reflex action.

285
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:33,141
-Happens all the time.
-Are you sure?

286
00:26:33,813 --> 00:26:37,407
Hell, I once had one set both
arms up and try to go for a coffee.

287
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:45,188
Now we just make
the incision right here.

288
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,465
-Hell.
-Earl?

289
00:26:52,465 --> 00:26:56,094
Never mind the juice. This one
goes in the ground this afternoon.

290
00:26:56,335 --> 00:26:59,205
They went cheap on us.
No wake, no deal.

291
00:26:59,205 --> 00:27:01,605
Even set up his own suit
to bury him in.

292
00:27:02,008 --> 00:27:04,176
Use that pine cast
at the workshop.

293
00:27:04,176 --> 00:27:06,168
The water damaged one?

294
00:27:06,312 --> 00:27:08,681
Sure, just slipe
a coat of varnish on it.

295
00:27:08,681 --> 00:27:10,249
Why waste a showroom model?

296
00:27:10,249 --> 00:27:12,584
We're not gonna make
a deadly squad on this job anyway.

297
00:27:12,584 --> 00:27:14,677
How is that new kid working up?

298
00:27:17,256 --> 00:27:18,553
Fine.

299
00:27:20,193 --> 00:27:22,524
Just fine.

300
00:27:58,264 --> 00:28:01,824
May the Lord claims our
departed brother in repentance...

301
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,195
for as the good book says...

302
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:08,067
"The night is far spent,
the day is at hand.

303
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,771
Let us therefore cast off
the works of darkness...

304
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:15,170
and let us put on
the armor of light.

305
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,309
For whether we live,
we live unto the Lord...

306
00:28:19,651 --> 00:28:22,518
and whether we die,
we die unto the Lord."

307
00:28:23,221 --> 00:28:27,884
We now command
Clint Goodman soul to almighty God.

308
00:28:29,295 --> 00:28:32,264
<i>Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.</i>

309
00:28:32,331 --> 00:28:35,766
<i>For dust thou art,
and dust thou shalt return.</i>

310
00:29:39,564 --> 00:29:41,666
-I wanna make a toast.
-No, no toasts.

311
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:44,499
Come on. I wanna make a toast.
Here, come on.

312
00:29:45,303 --> 00:29:47,396
To my beautiful darling.

313
00:29:47,472 --> 00:29:50,040
The grieving widow.
What a performance.

314
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,941
-Here.
-Cheers.

315
00:29:54,813 --> 00:29:57,838
Who was that old lady
that you threw your arms around?

316
00:29:57,982 --> 00:30:00,542
In a paroxysm of grief.
Who was that?

317
00:30:01,819 --> 00:30:03,412
I have no idea.

318
00:30:20,638 --> 00:30:22,540
-That's it.
-What?

319
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,167
I've had it with that dog.

320
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:27,035
Dog? Forget the dog.

321
00:30:29,513 --> 00:30:31,072
Forget the dog.

322
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,014
Now, come on. Forget the dog.

323
00:30:39,991 --> 00:30:43,620
-Is that a gun?
-Well, it ain't a can of apo.

324
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:50,991
What are you doing?

325
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:53,964
Heyi, Duke!

326
00:30:57,474 --> 00:31:00,375
-What?
-What a good boy!

327
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:02,838
Stay.

328
00:31:09,554 --> 00:31:11,885
Damn! I've missed!

329
00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:18,953
Are you nuts?

330
00:31:21,932 --> 00:31:24,365
Wait. Come here! Come here!

331
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:36,446
You're crazy.

332
00:34:11,433 --> 00:34:12,595
Go.

333
00:34:13,203 --> 00:34:14,499
Go!

334
00:34:17,073 --> 00:34:18,505
Yeah.

335
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,650
-What do you got?
-We have boiled chicken.

336
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:09,742
No.

337
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:13,720
-Strawberries.
-Oh yeah.

338
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,543
There's somebody at the window.

339
00:37:24,426 --> 00:37:26,826
-It's the dog.
-What?

340
00:37:27,128 --> 00:37:28,755
It's the dog

341
00:37:30,365 --> 00:37:31,730
The dog.

342
00:39:11,498 --> 00:39:15,799
There are no leans or claims
on your joint assets, Ms. Goodman.

343
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,506
This contains your
husband's crucial documents.

344
00:39:19,506 --> 00:39:21,940
Bank accounts, CD's
and so far.

345
00:39:23,643 --> 00:39:27,248
Now, as to the disposition
of the business...

346
00:39:27,248 --> 00:39:31,308
I believe there's a Mr. Bill Scorby
interested in buying it.

347
00:39:31,718 --> 00:39:33,419
Yes, I know Bill.

348
00:39:33,419 --> 00:39:35,690
If you want, I'll give him
a call right now.

349
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:36,883
Please.

350
00:39:37,157 --> 00:39:42,116
I understand that his offer
stands at a million and a half.

351
00:39:43,029 --> 00:39:47,661
I'm willing to accept, if payment
can be made within 48 hours.

352
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,402
In cash.

353
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,755
Yeah.

354
00:42:58,324 --> 00:43:01,724
Honey, I'm home.

355
00:43:41,466 --> 00:43:44,236
-Sam.
-Just thought I'd stop by...

356
00:43:44,236 --> 00:43:46,363
-and see how you're doing.
-That's very kind of you.

357
00:43:47,006 --> 00:43:50,406
-Would you like to come in?
-Thanks. I can't stay long though.

358
00:43:51,609 --> 00:43:54,009
Can I get you something to drink?
Some coffee?

359
00:43:54,279 --> 00:43:57,044
No, thanks. But I wouldn't
turn down something cold.

360
00:43:58,082 --> 00:43:59,751
How about a beer?

361
00:43:59,751 --> 00:44:01,946
Not when I'm on duty
but thanks anyway.

362
00:44:04,689 --> 00:44:07,827
-I have soda. Do you want a diet?
-Why bother?

363
00:44:07,827 --> 00:44:09,590
I didn't mean that...

364
00:44:12,998 --> 00:44:17,128
-I didn't mean anything.
-No problem. I'm used to it.

365
00:44:18,637 --> 00:44:21,265
I remember when Clint
was building this house.

366
00:44:22,107 --> 00:44:24,233
Did it with his bare hands.

367
00:44:25,777 --> 00:44:28,610
He had a real relationship
with wood, that man.

368
00:44:29,782 --> 00:44:33,512
Sometimes I think he was happy
picking splinters out of his fingers.

369
00:44:35,453 --> 00:44:37,819
I notice the
"For sale" sign out front.

370
00:44:38,657 --> 00:44:41,557
The place seems so big
now that Clint is gone.

371
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,352
There's too many memories.

372
00:44:44,529 --> 00:44:46,553
I hear you're selling
the business too.

373
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,327
I wouldn't know the first thing
about running a business.

374
00:44:51,569 --> 00:44:53,867
I think you're doing
the right thing.

375
00:44:54,037 --> 00:44:56,598
I'm sure Clint would've
wanted to see it go to Bill.

376
00:44:57,876 --> 00:45:02,246
I like to think so. I mean,
Clint always spoke so highly of Bill.

377
00:45:02,581 --> 00:45:04,514
So you'll be leaving town?

378
00:45:05,717 --> 00:45:07,446
We'll miss you.

379
00:45:10,923 --> 00:45:13,789
That rainstorm really kicked up
some mud last night.

380
00:45:18,863 --> 00:45:20,592
Yes, it did.

381
00:45:30,842 --> 00:45:33,678
Sheriff, you're
making me look bad.

382
00:45:33,678 --> 00:45:36,044
You're spending more time
with my patient than I am.

383
00:45:36,214 --> 00:45:38,147
I wouldn't know about that, doc.

384
00:45:38,615 --> 00:45:41,244
I better say goodbye.
I've gotta be on my way.

385
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,105
Cort...

386
00:46:24,362 --> 00:46:25,828
So...

387
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:31,234
-what did the sheriff have to say?
-He asked me all kinds of questions.

388
00:46:31,234 --> 00:46:34,067
When am I leaving town,
am I selling the house.

389
00:46:34,571 --> 00:46:36,004
I see.

390
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,466
<i>Did you thank him
for his concern?</i>

391
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:42,079
<i>He even knew I was
selling the business two hours...</i>

392
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,173
<i>after I walked out
the lawyer's office.</i>

393
00:46:45,383 --> 00:46:47,251
-Let's leave tonight.
-Honey, honey.

394
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:48,741
Right now.

395
00:46:48,953 --> 00:46:50,853
Hey, you're shaking.

396
00:46:51,722 --> 00:46:55,460
If you're worried about the
country boy with a badge, don't be.

397
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:58,997
I mean it, Cort. I cashed all
the accounts today. Let's just go.

398
00:46:58,997 --> 00:47:02,454
<i>The real money comes tomorrow
when you sell the business.</i>

399
00:47:02,799 --> 00:47:06,337
<i>-We need that money for the clinic.
-Cort, please.</i>

400
00:47:06,337 --> 00:47:08,771
Now, look. You listen to me.

401
00:47:08,972 --> 00:47:12,676
<i>All you have to do is hang in
with me on more night.</i>

402
00:47:12,676 --> 00:47:14,109
<i>And before you know it...</i>

403
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:17,974
we'll be in Beverly Hills
sipping margaritas by the pool.

404
00:47:18,882 --> 00:47:22,647
-Did we do the right thing?
-We did the only thing.

405
00:47:23,552 --> 00:47:27,683
All he ever saw was
flapjacks and babies.

406
00:47:29,226 --> 00:47:32,854
<i>Getting you pregnant was probably
the best thing he ever did.</i>

407
00:47:34,164 --> 00:47:37,362
If it wasn't for that, you never
would've come into my life.

408
00:47:38,202 --> 00:47:40,999
And I took care of that
problem for you, didn't I?

409
00:47:41,405 --> 00:47:42,771
Yes.

410
00:47:43,374 --> 00:47:47,310
<i>Like I'm gonna take care of all
of your problems from now on.</i>

411
00:47:48,311 --> 00:47:52,680
<i>-You know I'm right.
-Yes, you're right.</i>

412
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,480
No.

413
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:15,696
That's too easy.

414
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:24,411
Sra. Goodman, I believe
we have an appointment.

415
00:52:31,693 --> 00:52:33,888
Would you like to count it?

416
00:52:35,796 --> 00:52:39,393
No. I'm sure it's all there.

417
00:52:39,901 --> 00:52:45,736
Sra. Goodman, I just want to say
how bad I feel about Clint's passing.

418
00:52:46,674 --> 00:52:49,007
Getting the business this way...

419
00:52:51,714 --> 00:52:53,647
I'm sorry. What?

420
00:52:55,684 --> 00:52:59,313
You'll get over it, dear.
Just takes time.

421
00:53:02,724 --> 00:53:04,316
Yes.

422
00:53:06,828 --> 00:53:08,626
Can I see you out?

423
00:53:09,999 --> 00:53:12,330
Thank you. Thank you.

424
00:53:13,368 --> 00:53:15,029
Goodbye.

425
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:23,436
Yes!

426
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:32,386
The whole damn thing
is a disgrace.

427
00:53:32,386 --> 00:53:35,289
First that wife of his puts
him under pretty damn quick.

428
00:53:35,289 --> 00:53:37,313
We didn't even
have time to embalm him.

429
00:53:37,624 --> 00:53:39,216
And now this.

430
00:53:40,529 --> 00:53:43,794
This is how I found it.
I didn't touch a thing.

431
00:53:50,872 --> 00:53:53,341
-What happened here?
-I don't know, sheriff.

432
00:53:53,642 --> 00:53:55,973
Looks to me like
somebody dug him up.

433
00:53:59,746 --> 00:54:01,682
Jesus Christ.

434
00:54:03,017 --> 00:54:05,853
This could ruin me
over night if word got out.

435
00:54:05,853 --> 00:54:08,616
Is there anyway
we can keep this quiet?

436
00:54:10,324 --> 00:54:13,294
Dig up the coffin and take it
to my home, not to the station.

437
00:54:13,294 --> 00:54:15,396
Then come back and fill
the hole in and cover it all up.

438
00:54:15,396 --> 00:54:17,831
And don't say this to anybody.
I don't want any questions...

439
00:54:17,831 --> 00:54:20,734
until after I finish
my investigation. You understand?

440
00:54:20,734 --> 00:54:22,970
It's a hell of a thing when
they start stealing bodies...

441
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:24,561
right out of the ground.

442
00:54:25,238 --> 00:54:27,942
Who would do a thing like this,
that's what I've like to know.

443
00:54:27,942 --> 00:54:29,169
So would I.

444
00:56:07,807 --> 00:56:10,277
<i>-Hello.
-I need you over here right now.</i>

445
00:56:10,277 --> 00:56:13,946
<i>The doctor's not in, but leave a
message at the sound of the bip...</i>

446
00:56:13,946 --> 00:56:16,974
<i>I'll return your call as soon
as possible. Bye for now.</i>

447
00:56:17,517 --> 00:56:20,154
<i>Cortland, take up the phone.</i>

448
00:56:20,154 --> 00:56:23,987
<i>Someone's been in the house.
He may still be here.</i>

449
00:56:25,825 --> 00:56:27,760
You better be on your way.

450
00:56:28,596 --> 00:56:30,427
Please, Cortland.

451
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:38,204
My God.

452
00:56:59,259 --> 00:57:00,624
Duke.

453
00:57:03,762 --> 00:57:05,992
You're very good dog.

454
00:57:08,436 --> 00:57:09,959
Yes, you are.

455
00:57:12,072 --> 00:57:13,539
Stay.

456
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:22,614
Okay. Stay.

457
00:57:29,089 --> 00:57:30,351
Okay.

458
00:57:31,191 --> 00:57:34,285
Let me just...
Stay there.

459
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:41,961
Well, Joanna.
Don't ask me what is this.

460
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:33,184
How are my beautiful girls?

461
00:58:36,155 --> 00:58:38,680
You love your daddy, don't you?

462
00:58:38,857 --> 00:58:40,757
Yes, you do.

463
00:58:41,694 --> 00:58:44,595
And your daddy love you.

464
00:58:45,064 --> 00:58:53,769
<i># So make it one for my baby
# And one more for the road</i>

465
00:58:54,940 --> 00:59:00,810
<i># You wouldn't know it
# But I'm a kind of poet</i>

466
00:59:02,181 --> 00:59:06,278
<i># And I've got
# A lot of things to say</i>

467
00:59:14,994 --> 00:59:19,431
<i>Dr. Van Owen, you are now
six months behind on the rent.</i>

468
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:22,100
<i>And you've ignored
three eviction notices.</i>

469
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,170
<i>I'm coming by on Monday with a
federal marshal and a court order...</i>

470
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:28,401
<i>to have you physically
removed from the property.</i>

471
00:59:28,574 --> 00:59:32,840
<i>I'm sorry, but you've left me
no choice in this matter.</i>

472
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:41,353
<i>Cortland, take up the phone.</i>

473
00:59:41,353 --> 00:59:44,881
<i>Someone's been in the house.
He may still be here.</i>

474
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:47,448
<i>You better be on your way.</i>

475
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,446
Joanna?

476
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:22,719
Joanna, darling?

477
01:00:38,011 --> 01:00:39,773
Joanna?

478
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,656
Hey, baby.

479
01:01:11,375 --> 01:01:13,741
It never would
have worked, darling.

480
01:01:13,845 --> 01:01:15,506
Too much of a slob.

481
01:01:24,689 --> 01:01:26,384
<i>Joanna?</i>

482
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:45,099
<i>Joanna? Joanna?</i>

483
01:01:47,144 --> 01:01:50,239
<i>-Cortland?
-It's time we have a little talk.</i>

484
01:01:53,718 --> 01:01:56,551
I would rather blow
your brains out.

485
01:02:26,851 --> 01:02:28,318
Joanna?

486
01:02:38,229 --> 01:02:39,662
Joanna?

487
01:02:48,606 --> 01:02:51,597
Joanna, you can come out now.

488
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,348
Sweetheart?

489
01:03:06,591 --> 01:03:09,423
I'm starting to get
real annoyed here.

490
01:03:23,475 --> 01:03:25,408
No!

491
01:03:26,277 --> 01:03:28,211
<i>No!</i>

492
01:03:52,602 --> 01:03:54,092
I'm sorry.

493
01:03:54,971 --> 01:03:56,802
-Are you alright?
-Are you crazy?

494
01:03:59,008 --> 01:04:02,172
-Why did you hit me?
-I thought you were...

495
01:04:02,312 --> 01:04:04,781
-When you came down here, I...
-What?

496
01:04:05,249 --> 01:04:08,115
I thought you were him.

497
01:04:11,022 --> 01:04:12,852
Somebody knows?

498
01:04:14,124 --> 01:04:17,116
-Who is it?
-I don't know.

499
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:20,094
But he's locked us down here.

500
01:04:21,297 --> 01:04:23,322
Did you see him?
What did he look like?

501
01:04:23,667 --> 01:04:26,904
He was wearing a mask.
Like a welder's thing.

502
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:28,769
I couldn't see his face.

503
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:32,102
I think I shot him.
Maybe he's wounded.

504
01:04:39,182 --> 01:04:41,412
He sounds pretty healthy to me.

505
01:04:45,155 --> 01:04:47,715
He's moving the furniture.

506
01:04:49,859 --> 01:04:53,726
I planned it so carefully.
Every last detail.

507
01:04:54,063 --> 01:04:57,865
And some lunatic comes along and
starts playing interior decorator.

508
01:05:00,704 --> 01:05:03,195
Joanna, who did you tell?

509
01:05:03,273 --> 01:05:07,077
-I didn't tell anybody.
-Are you sure?

510
01:05:07,077 --> 01:05:09,446
Of course I'm sure. You think
I took an ad from the paper?

511
01:05:09,446 --> 01:05:12,905
-I thought that was you.
-You thought that...?

512
01:05:14,851 --> 01:05:17,342
You thought that
I came to hurt you?

513
01:05:17,787 --> 01:05:21,052
Joanna, how could you think that?

514
01:05:22,192 --> 01:05:24,961
-I love you.
-I'm sorry.

515
01:05:24,961 --> 01:05:26,518
You're sorry?

516
01:05:26,962 --> 01:05:28,055
Here.

517
01:05:29,666 --> 01:05:31,098
You want me to burn this?

518
01:05:32,368 --> 01:05:34,892
-I'll burn it right now.
-What are you talking about?

519
01:05:35,037 --> 01:05:36,436
I'll burn the whole thing.

520
01:05:37,172 --> 01:05:39,766
Everything I did, I did for you.

521
01:05:40,543 --> 01:05:43,670
I love you.
Joanna, hell, I'd die for you.

522
01:05:44,646 --> 01:05:47,615
Sweetheart, I didn't know.

523
01:05:47,783 --> 01:05:50,117
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

524
01:05:50,187 --> 01:05:53,383
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-It's alright. It's alright.

525
01:05:54,357 --> 01:05:57,792
-What are we going to do?
-We're going to get out of here.

526
01:05:59,396 --> 01:06:00,761
Right now.

527
01:06:02,065 --> 01:06:03,327
Alright.

528
01:06:04,634 --> 01:06:06,658
Alright.
Stand back, stand back.

529
01:06:08,271 --> 01:06:09,238
Alright.

530
01:06:16,712 --> 01:06:17,975
Wait.

531
01:06:20,015 --> 01:06:21,313
What?

532
01:06:23,018 --> 01:06:24,315
What is it?

533
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:30,657
-These are blanks.
-What?

534
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:34,496
They're blanks. Somebody's cut off
the ends and put out the pillars.

535
01:06:34,496 --> 01:06:36,794
These are nothing but
gunpowder and air.

536
01:06:39,268 --> 01:06:40,894
Who are you?

537
01:06:44,207 --> 01:06:47,574
Alright. Alright.

538
01:06:51,848 --> 01:06:54,646
That's clever. Very clever.

539
01:06:55,518 --> 01:06:58,179
Well leave here
in about thirty seconds.

540
01:07:13,703 --> 01:07:17,502
-It nearly took my face off.
-We're stucked down here.

541
01:07:18,841 --> 01:07:21,810
This is great.
This is just great.

542
01:07:22,611 --> 01:07:25,347
We've got Jason upstairs
and Cujo in the front yard.

543
01:07:25,347 --> 01:07:27,247
And I'm having a real good time.

544
01:07:28,249 --> 01:07:31,083
You've got a serious
attitude problem, pal!

545
01:07:33,156 --> 01:07:34,851
Talk to me!

546
01:07:47,936 --> 01:07:53,203
Honey, you don't like the house?
I can always remodel.

547
01:08:42,857 --> 01:08:45,156
-What?
-Listen.

548
01:08:46,628 --> 01:08:49,597
-What?
-It's quiet.

549
01:08:55,003 --> 01:08:59,167
-How long we've been down here?
-About eight hours.

550
01:08:59,774 --> 01:09:01,366
Feels like a month.

551
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:05,244
I have this figured it out.

552
01:09:06,949 --> 01:09:08,711
I know who it is.

553
01:09:09,016 --> 01:09:12,508
-Who?
-It sounds farfetched.

554
01:09:13,521 --> 01:09:15,546
You won't believe this.

555
01:09:16,090 --> 01:09:19,857
-Who?
-Your redneck sheriff.

556
01:09:20,195 --> 01:09:23,187
-Sam?
-Who else could it be?

557
01:09:24,666 --> 01:09:28,570
-Who else could've figured it out?
-Why hasn't he arrested us?

558
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:30,400
You don't get it.

559
01:09:31,206 --> 01:09:33,766
There isn't going to be an arrest.

560
01:09:34,508 --> 01:09:36,669
He wants a piece.

561
01:09:37,378 --> 01:09:39,846
Maybe he wants
the whole damn pie.

562
01:09:39,948 --> 01:09:42,109
I underestimated him.

563
01:09:42,851 --> 01:09:45,410
He's not as dumb as he looks.

564
01:09:46,854 --> 01:09:50,222
-But it's gonna cost him.
-What do you mean?

565
01:09:50,559 --> 01:09:54,324
I'm going to rip out his heart
and shove it down his throat.

566
01:09:54,762 --> 01:09:57,628
And I'm gonna laugh
when he chokes of it.

567
01:10:00,935 --> 01:10:02,493
Yes, indeed.

568
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:06,129
I'm going to rip his heart out
with my bare hands.

569
01:10:06,773 --> 01:10:09,071
And I'm gonna enjoy that.

570
01:10:09,511 --> 01:10:13,446
Sooner or later he's gonna
have to open that door.

571
01:10:13,681 --> 01:10:16,149
And he's gonna have
to make his terms known.

572
01:10:17,085 --> 01:10:21,613
And whatever they are, I'll agree
to them. Nice and friendly.

573
01:10:22,256 --> 01:10:24,383
With a big smile on my face.

574
01:10:25,026 --> 01:10:27,517
Cooperating every inch
of the way.

575
01:10:28,162 --> 01:10:30,529
"Happy to do business with you.

576
01:10:31,265 --> 01:10:34,723
Whatever you want, pal.
Whatever you say.

577
01:10:35,703 --> 01:10:39,298
Just name it, it's yours.
No problem here."

578
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:43,239
And when we're finally
feeling all warm and charity...

579
01:10:44,445 --> 01:10:47,346
and he gets close enough
to take that money...

580
01:10:48,581 --> 01:10:51,608
I'm going to beat him
to death with the shotgun.

581
01:10:53,286 --> 01:10:58,519
And then I'm gonna dance
out of here. As free as you please.

582
01:10:59,993 --> 01:11:02,656
I'd like you to burn
the money now.

583
01:11:06,233 --> 01:11:09,828
-What are you talking about?
-To prove how much you love me.

584
01:11:10,236 --> 01:11:12,206
Burn it all right now.

585
01:11:13,241 --> 01:11:17,802
-You were ready to do it before.
-This is our ticket out of here.

586
01:11:18,245 --> 01:11:21,147
-Think for a moment.
-You love me?

587
01:11:21,147 --> 01:11:24,413
-Yes, I love you.
-You'd die for me?

588
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:26,711
You know I would.

589
01:11:27,787 --> 01:11:30,483
Here's your chance, you bastard.

590
01:11:31,158 --> 01:11:32,624
No!

591
01:11:33,327 --> 01:11:35,396
Wait a minute here.

592
01:11:35,396 --> 01:11:37,920
You had this planned
from the start, didn't you?

593
01:11:37,997 --> 01:11:41,101
Was never about me.
You used me.

594
01:11:41,101 --> 01:11:43,935
now you want that clinic
all to yourself.

595
01:11:44,638 --> 01:11:49,700
There never was a clinic,
you dumb bitch.

596
01:11:51,711 --> 01:11:55,416
No, baby. I'm booked on
a one-way flight to the Tropics.

597
01:11:55,416 --> 01:11:58,752
I'm gonna seat on the beach earning
18% while I diddle the locals...

598
01:11:58,752 --> 01:12:01,550
and maybe, just maybe
I'll get off for a change.

599
01:12:24,978 --> 01:12:26,742
Come here.

600
01:12:26,847 --> 01:12:31,044
I'm not gonna lie here, darling.
This is really gonna hurt.

601
01:12:39,492 --> 01:12:43,052
Well? You're gonna
waste that on me?

602
01:12:45,431 --> 01:12:46,922
No.

603
01:12:47,768 --> 01:12:49,030
No.

604
01:12:51,171 --> 01:12:53,766
-This is for him.
-Good.

605
01:13:17,597 --> 01:13:19,394
-Go on.
-What?

606
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,361
-Go on.
-You go.

607
01:13:23,836 --> 01:13:25,393
Come on.

608
01:13:27,674 --> 01:13:31,075
-Come on, go on.
-You make me sick.

609
01:13:45,925 --> 01:13:47,323
Hello?

610
01:13:50,397 --> 01:13:52,762
Looks like we're gonna
work this thing out.

611
01:13:55,701 --> 01:13:57,862
Come on, darling.
Turn on the light.

612
01:14:06,278 --> 01:14:07,814
It's not here.

613
01:14:07,814 --> 01:14:10,681
-The light?
-The dining room

614
01:14:29,034 --> 01:14:31,026
The front door was here,
wasn't it?

615
01:14:31,838 --> 01:14:33,396
Yes.

616
01:14:35,375 --> 01:14:39,144
Look, I can tell that you're not
ready to discuss this seriously.

617
01:14:39,144 --> 01:14:41,147
So I'll tell you what, you let
me know when you are ready...

618
01:14:41,147 --> 01:14:42,876
and we'll be in the basement.

619
01:14:45,385 --> 01:14:47,444
Damn it. Damn it.

620
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,754
-Joanna?
-I'm right here.

621
01:15:27,926 --> 01:15:31,164
Look, we're here to negotiate.
In good faith.

622
01:15:31,164 --> 01:15:33,064
And you're making me angry.

623
01:15:39,171 --> 01:15:41,740
Fine. Let's seat in the living room,
seat on the couch...

624
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:44,209
put our feet up,
discuss this man to man.

625
01:17:55,972 --> 01:17:57,875
I want to get out! Damn it!

626
01:17:57,875 --> 01:17:59,276
Stop it.

627
01:18:02,214 --> 01:18:03,976
Just stop it!

628
01:18:04,181 --> 01:18:07,549
-What?
-I said stop it.

629
01:18:18,929 --> 01:18:20,261
Look...

630
01:18:21,298 --> 01:18:24,961
let's go fifty, fifty here, pal?
What do you say?

631
01:18:26,136 --> 01:18:28,366
It doesn't get
any fairer than that.

632
01:18:30,174 --> 01:18:33,143
Come on, talk to me! Please?

633
01:18:35,613 --> 01:18:36,944
Look...

634
01:18:37,648 --> 01:18:39,638
She's the one you want.

635
01:18:39,749 --> 01:18:42,286
-She killed him.
-It was his idea!

636
01:18:42,286 --> 01:18:43,654
Shut up.

637
01:18:43,654 --> 01:18:46,090
You didn't have the guts
to do your own dirty work.

638
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:49,286
-You filthy coward.
-That's it!

639
01:18:54,065 --> 01:18:55,396
Cort!

640
01:18:56,066 --> 01:18:57,397
Cort!

641
01:19:05,709 --> 01:19:07,176
Cort?

642
01:19:08,812 --> 01:19:11,109
That's good. That's good.
That's clever.

643
01:19:11,382 --> 01:19:14,215
That's very clever.
Cut her out entirely.

644
01:19:14,685 --> 01:19:16,676
I mean, it's my thinking exactly.

645
01:19:17,121 --> 01:19:19,816
Fine. Alright.

646
01:19:33,637 --> 01:19:36,400
That window is sure
is a squid side.

647
01:19:36,739 --> 01:19:39,004
I don't mind telling you.

648
01:19:39,976 --> 01:19:43,072
I bet I know how to buy
my way through it.

649
01:19:46,317 --> 01:19:48,182
Well, here it is.

650
01:19:48,485 --> 01:19:50,282
Fifty, fifty.

651
01:19:51,989 --> 01:19:53,786
Well...

652
01:19:54,358 --> 01:19:56,451
sixty, forty.

653
01:19:59,463 --> 01:20:02,693
Seventy, thirty.
It doesn't get fairer than that.

654
01:20:06,637 --> 01:20:08,298
I'll tell you what.

655
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:11,902
It's yours.

656
01:20:12,942 --> 01:20:15,844
Every dime, okay?

657
01:20:17,514 --> 01:20:20,346
I mean, this is it.
This is my final offer.

658
01:20:21,718 --> 01:20:23,981
I just want out of here, Sam.

659
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,079
Okay?

660
01:20:28,257 --> 01:20:29,918
Please.

661
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:33,727
Sam.

662
01:20:37,534 --> 01:20:39,297
Keep it.

663
01:21:28,584 --> 01:21:30,109
Cort?

664
01:22:14,062 --> 01:22:17,520
Please, why are you
doing this to me?

665
01:22:19,136 --> 01:22:23,265
Like a rat in a maze.
Remember?

666
01:22:23,639 --> 01:22:25,004
Clint.

667
01:22:26,209 --> 01:22:28,074
Our child, Joanna...

668
01:22:29,512 --> 01:22:31,946
was it a boy or a girl?

669
01:22:34,417 --> 01:22:36,749
I suppose it doesn't matter.

670
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,372
No!

671
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,805
No!

672
01:23:58,567 --> 01:23:59,829
Duke.

673
01:24:57,193 --> 01:24:59,961
This is Sheriff Eberly.
We've got a 904 in progress.

674
01:24:59,961 --> 01:25:03,397
I don't know. Better get
the fire department out here.

675
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:14,100
Put more water pressure, please.

676
01:25:26,053 --> 01:25:28,920
-Well?
-There's nobody in there.

677
01:25:29,524 --> 01:25:32,890
-Nobody?
-We searched from one end...

678
01:25:33,027 --> 01:25:34,324
to the other. Nothing.

679
01:25:34,561 --> 01:25:37,291
If you're looking for corpses,
you're looking in the wrong place.

680
01:26:16,403 --> 01:26:19,202
Chilly today.
Should've worn my top coat.

681
01:26:21,041 --> 01:26:24,340
I came to pay my respects
to a friend, he's buried here.

682
01:26:24,845 --> 01:26:26,676
Did you know him?

683
01:26:28,315 --> 01:26:30,010
No.

684
01:26:30,851 --> 01:26:33,786
Died last week. Died suddenly.

685
01:26:34,154 --> 01:26:35,712
I never...

686
01:26:36,557 --> 01:26:38,591
Never had the chance to tell
him how much our friendship...

687
01:26:38,591 --> 01:26:40,060
really meant to me.

688
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:45,230
Maybe he knows.

689
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:56,909
Hey, mister?

690
