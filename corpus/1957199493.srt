1
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:12,975
[Shannon, narrating]
I've always been
a hopeless romantic.

2
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:16,101
Even as a kid, I had these
Barbie-inspired dreams

3
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:19,810
of the perfect wedding
I'd have someday.

4
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:22,143
This is how
I thought I'd look.

5
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:23,975
Love the hair? Ugh.

6
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:26,268
[chuckles]
And how many Irish housewives

7
00:01:26,292 --> 00:01:29,334
went blind making lace
for that dress?

8
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:33,975
Hmm. My future husband.

9
00:01:33,999 --> 00:01:36,310
Very Greg Brady.

10
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:37,894
Yes, yes, Greg was
way too old for me,

11
00:01:37,918 --> 00:01:40,975
but even in reruns,
he was my first crush,

12
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:43,518
and I'm nothing
if not loyal.

13
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:47,375
[sighs] Could this be
any more embarrassing?

14
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:53,643
[birds singing]

15
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:55,975
[Shannon]
So, flip the calendar pages.

16
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:57,975
I grew up
and the big day came,

17
00:01:57,999 --> 00:02:02,976
and this is what
my dreams looked like
a couple of decades later.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,310
Mr. and Mrs. Jack Wicker.

19
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,768
Mom would have preferred
Bates-hyphen-Wicker,

20
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:10,976
but it was just
too early '90s for me.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,143
That's me, of course,
the bride.

22
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:17,101
Almost as pretty
as the groom.

23
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,935
Perfect, isn't it?

24
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,834
I mean, right down to
the flower girl in horn-rims.

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,894
[Shannon]
But this is how it turned out.

26
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:38,018
[glass shatters]

27
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:40,042
[weeping]

28
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,602
Oh, honey,

29
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,976
I wanna be
supportive, but I...

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,727
I just don't know
what to say.

31
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:57,685
Don't say anything,
not a word, or I'll just...

32
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:00,018
Ugh! I'll scream!

33
00:03:00,042 --> 00:03:03,518
[sniffles loudly]
I don't wanna scream.

34
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:07,727
I wanna sit here
and cry in peace.

35
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:09,999
Okay.

36
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,643
[groans, sobs]

37
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:26,209
I thought they never
locked churches.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,894
There's a bar
down the street.

39
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:31,975
Oh, honey.

40
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:34,226
Drinking
isn't the answer.

41
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,643
I don't need a drink.

42
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:38,810
I need a bathroom.

43
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:39,810
Do you have a car?

44
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:42,975
No, I came with
Jack's family.

45
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:44,975
Didn't you...
You're not serious.

46
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:46,975
I haven't driven
in years.

47
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:49,751
In Los Angeles,
I pay people to
do that for me.

48
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,268
We'll have to walk it.

49
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:54,751
Really?

50
00:03:57,999 --> 00:04:00,976
[Shannon, narrating]
Is this pitiful?

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,268
I mean...[chuckles]

52
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:07,894
this was so not the way
I saw this day going.

53
00:04:07,918 --> 00:04:10,976
There must have been
signs I missed, but where?

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,685
Everything seemed fine
in L.A. the week before...

55
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:17,976
except for the fact
we were there
to visit my mother.

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,975
She can't be as bad
as all that.

57
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:21,518
This is the same woman

58
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:24,810
who missed my graduation
for a business lunch.

59
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:26,975
So, whatever you do,

60
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:29,975
please don’t start
taking her side today, okay?

61
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:31,018
I couldn't handle that.

62
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:33,810
Never. Your side
all the way.

63
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:36,727
How long since
you've seen her?

64
00:04:36,751 --> 00:04:38,975
How long have
I lived in Boston?

65
00:04:38,999 --> 00:04:40,643
Almost 2 years?

66
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:42,602
Yeah, almost 2 years.

67
00:04:42,626 --> 00:04:45,518
The most peaceful
"almost 2 years" of my life.

68
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:47,975
You've got to relax.

69
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,976
We'll meet your
mother,

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,018
we'll go to dinner,

71
00:04:50,042 --> 00:04:52,101
we'll tell her
the news...

72
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,250
and it'll be
just fine.

73
00:04:57,999 --> 00:05:03,226
We have 3 issues left before
our 25th anniversary issue.

74
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,018
And it's got to be special.

75
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:08,143
Who was hot
when we started,

76
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:10,393
and where are
they now? Cheryl.

77
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:13,226
We're doing features on
the cast of Urban Cowboy,

78
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,351
and Who Shot J.R.?

79
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,101
J.R. who?

80
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,584
Remind me to fire you later.

81
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,975
Kurt. Photo layouts.

82
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,393
Mount St. Helens.
Reagan. John Lennon.
Fine.

83
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:24,685
For the cover, a face.

84
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:27,975
Someone the competition
hasn't touched.

85
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:30,018
That movie star
who's in seclusion.

86
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:32,351
Amy? What's-her-name?

87
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,975
Who slept with
you-know-who?

88
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:36,226
She's a nun in
the Italian Alps.

89
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,975
Vow of silence.
Interview unlikely.

90
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:43,560
Okay. Then get me...
an Elvis. A Janis Joplin.

91
00:05:43,584 --> 00:05:46,167
Someone. I can't
do this alone, people.

92
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:48,935
I want access

93
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,042
to someone
we can't get access to.

94
00:05:57,417 --> 00:06:02,018
Oh...was it today that
you were coming in?

95
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:03,975
Oh...it was today.

96
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:05,976
Right about now,
actually.
Oh...

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,643
I've been so looking
forward to this visit.

98
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:10,667
Aw...

99
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:15,083
Is that really how
you're wearing your
hair these days?

100
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,518
You didn't tell me
you were bringing
a guest.

101
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:21,975
Um...yes, I did, Mother.
You put me on hold.

102
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:23,894
This is Jack Wicker.

103
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:26,602
Jack? This is my mother.

104
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:28,268
Nice to finally meet you,
Mrs. Bates.

105
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:30,876
Oh, now now. You must
call me Marla.

106
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:33,976
And aren't you
the handsome one.

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,018
My daughter's taste
is definitely improving.

108
00:06:37,042 --> 00:06:39,000
If you're smart,
you'll keep this one.

109
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,518
Well, um...actually...

110
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:44,975
That's...
why we're here.

111
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:45,999
Surprise.

112
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,894
I, uh...need
to excuse myself.

113
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:07,643
If...
if that's okay.

114
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:09,792
Hm. Help yourself.

115
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:22,143
I find out about him

116
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:25,894
the same day I discover
you're engaged?

117
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:28,477
How long have you
known this man?

118
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:30,876
Uh...we've been dating
for over a year.

119
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:34,667
If I haven't told you
about him, it's because...

120
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:37,560
you know how you are.

121
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:38,975
No. How am I?

122
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:40,975
No one is ever
good enough for me.

123
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:43,059
Well, if you're talking
about that electrician...

124
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,975
He was a computer
engineer, Mother.

125
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,560
His company is number two
in software today.

126
00:07:48,584 --> 00:07:50,101
Okay. Right there.
Right there.

127
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,417
Number two.

128
00:07:52,834 --> 00:07:54,477
We didn't come
for your blessing.

129
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:57,018
If it'd been up to me,
I might've just gone
ahead and done it.

130
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:58,810
But Jack insisted
on meeting you.

131
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:01,976
Well, I guess I should
thank my lucky stars
for Jack.

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,459
[sighs]

133
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:07,975
Ah, old friends
of my family.

134
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:09,143
[laughs]

135
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:11,975
Small world.
Oh, yeah.

136
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:13,975
So...uh...
what did I miss?

137
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:15,999
That was my
question, too.

138
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:19,975
Mom's feeling
insecure.
Umm...

139
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,518
I love your daughter,
Mrs. Bates.

140
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,894
Oh. Marla.

141
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:24,292
Mrs. Bates is fine
for now.

142
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:29,393
I've heard so much
about you from Shannon.

143
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:32,018
So you wanted to see
for yourself, did you?

144
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:33,143
He didn't mean it
that way.

145
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:36,751
I know.
He's much too polite.

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,351
[deep breath]

147
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,375
Well.

148
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:44,810
If you're serious
about this wedding,

149
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:47,435
why don't we plan it
for next winter?

150
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,768
Oh! Um, better yet...

151
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:51,226
the following spring?

152
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,393
We'll have it right here
in Beverly Hills.

153
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:55,167
And I'll handle
everything.

154
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,167
Mom.

155
00:08:58,167 --> 00:08:59,209
The wedding
is next week.

156
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:06,101
[bangs on table]

157
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,125
Next week?

158
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:11,268
Since Jack's family
is all in Boston,

159
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:13,435
and...all I have
is you,

160
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:14,852
we're having
the service there.

161
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:17,393
Maybe just one more.
Of course,
Ma'am.

162
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:18,975
I'm assuming you would
like to attend?

163
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:19,975
Where else would I be?

164
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:21,975
How can you ask that?

165
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:24,018
And you...you don't
want any help?

166
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:25,975
It's all arranged.

167
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,518
Church, food, flowers.

168
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:30,393
My parents have taken
care of everything.

169
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:31,417
Oh.

170
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,185
I guess the only thing
left for me is to...

171
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,334
buy a gift for
the happy couple.

172
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:41,059
How 'bout a honeymoon?

173
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,975
Uh...Jack's made
the plans already.

174
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:43,999
Two weeks.

175
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,685
On a small island
in the Caribbean.

176
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:48,518
Sandals and seaweed?

177
00:09:48,542 --> 00:09:50,727

within a week.

357
00:19:23,918 --> 00:19:25,083
Well, I don't know.

358
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,101
Maybe...no.

359
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,393
Yet...

360
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:34,250
I don't know.
[sighs, stomach gurgles]

361
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:39,059
I, um...
[clears throat]

362
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,834
I'll be right back.

363
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,250
Think about it,
sweetheart.

364
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:49,643
You and I, like...
like girlfriends.

365
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:53,935
And the sea air.
The swaying palm trees.

366
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,209
Pina coladas.

367
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:58,792
A honeymoon with Mom!

368
00:20:00,584 --> 00:20:02,334
[forced laugh]

369
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:08,834
[beep]

370
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,876
Latrice? It's me.

371
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:15,935
I want you to cancel
every meeting I have

372
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:17,018
for the next two weeks.

373
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:18,727
I want you to go
into my schedule

374
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:19,999
and wipe it clean.

375
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:23,999
I think I have
the cover story.

376
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:27,999
Thanks.

377
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:32,209
[chuckles softly]

378
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:35,518
[Shannon] If this were
a courtroom, I'd plead
temporary insanity.

379
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:37,975
I mean, my mother and me,
on my honeymoon?

380
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:39,975
Ugh. What was I thinking?

381
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:43,351
Mom saw it as a chance
to hit every boutique
on Rodeo Drive,

382
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,727
and came back with a wardrobe
that would have made
Carmen Miranda blush.

383
00:20:46,751 --> 00:20:49,477
You bought all this
just for the trip.

384
00:20:49,501 --> 00:20:52,602
Oh, just a few things
I thought might come in handy.

385
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,626
Only if you're
opening for Don Ho.

386
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:59,976
An afternoon by the pool?

387
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,167
Yeah, with that blouse,
I think the darker,
the better.

388
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:07,417
Shannon, I promise
this will be the perfect trip.

389
00:21:08,626 --> 00:21:09,975
I'll loosen up.

390
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:13,810
I'll be as laid back
as I possibly can be.
You.

391
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:15,976
Um...how should
I pack this, Miss Bates?

392
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,602
[deep breath]
Well, maybe I'll wear it.

393
00:21:18,626 --> 00:21:20,167
I'll find something
to match.

394
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,876
What do you think? Is it me?

395
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,935
You're not serious.

396
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:47,852
This isn't Paris, Mom.

397
00:21:47,876 --> 00:21:49,975
Well, it's not
Iraq, either.

398
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:52,518
If you're not up for this,
now's your chance to catch
a plane home.

399
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:54,185
Uh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

400
00:21:54,209 --> 00:21:56,125
[stammering]
I...I want to. I do.

401
00:21:58,876 --> 00:22:00,727
Thank you.
[Valet] Enjoy your stay.

402
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:02,975
There aren't
any windows.

403
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:05,518
We can zip them in later,
if it cools off.

404
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:07,518
Zip them?

405
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:08,975
Buckle up
and hold on.

406
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:11,143
Hold on to what?

407
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:12,626
[yelps]

408
00:22:28,209 --> 00:22:30,125
[seagull cawing]

409
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:50,852
This is it?

410
00:22:50,876 --> 00:22:53,975
[sighs]
This is it.

411
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:56,584
Well, this... this isn't
at all bad.

412
00:22:58,999 --> 00:23:00,935
Ooo, Nice butt.

413
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:02,852
Mom...
Well, it is.

414
00:23:02,876 --> 00:23:05,852
Mm-hm. Aloha.

415
00:23:05,876 --> 00:23:07,976
Aloha.

416
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,435
Enjoy your stay.

417
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:10,975
Oh, we will.

418
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:12,999
[laughing]
[Shannon] Oh, Mom...

419
00:23:15,876 --> 00:23:18,976
Um...so it's not
Mr. and Mrs. Wicker?

420
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,727
No. It's Miss
and Mrs. Bates.

421
00:23:21,751 --> 00:23:23,975
That's Ms.
Ms. Bates.

422
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:26,435
Uh...we understood
this was going to be
a honeymoon trip.

423
00:23:26,459 --> 00:23:29,976
Uh...no. He had
a...change of plans,

424
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,101
and is somewhere over
Switzerland right about now.
Is that a problem?

425
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:36,101
No. Not at all.
Right?

426
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,975
[keys rattle]
Follow me.

427
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,459
Hm. I'll be
right behind you.

428
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,059
Excuse me. I understand
Nick Tercel owns this hotel.

429
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,975
I suppose he wouldn't
be available to say hello?

430
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:50,727
Oh, you know him,
do you?

431
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:53,101
Oh, well...not really.

432
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,876
I'm just a huge fan.

433
00:23:56,042 --> 00:23:58,975
Um...Mr. Tercel
values his privacy.

434
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:00,975
But, should I see him,

435
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:02,975
I'd be happy to tell him that
you've been asking about him.

436
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:04,185
No, no.

437
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,685
I'm sure I'll bump into him
sooner or later.

438
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:07,709
Okay.

439
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:13,667
[cell phone beeps]

440
00:24:15,334 --> 00:24:18,351
Latrice. The eagle
has landed.

441
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:21,560
In absolutely nowhere.

442
00:24:21,584 --> 00:24:26,435
[sighs] But, I'll be sending
the tapes just as soon as I
get the interview.

443
00:24:26,459 --> 00:24:28,209
Over and out.

444
00:24:29,876 --> 00:24:31,501
[chuckles]

445
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:34,894
Everything's inside
the bedroom, Ma'am.

446
00:24:34,918 --> 00:24:36,975
Oh, I'm not a ma'am.
I'm a Marla!

447
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:37,975
[sighs]
[laughs]

448
00:24:37,999 --> 00:24:39,059
Whatever you say, Ma'am.

449
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:41,685
Have you worked
here long?

450
00:24:41,709 --> 00:24:44,393
Most of us just
work here summers.

451
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:45,518
I've been here a few.

452
00:24:45,542 --> 00:24:47,727
I'll bet you
know people.

453
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:50,975

Like, say...
the owner?

454
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:52,768
Umm...
Nick something?

455
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:55,268
Mr. Tercel.
Yeah, sure.

456
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:57,518
Would you do me
a favor?

457
00:24:57,542 --> 00:25:00,310
I would so like to meet him
while we're here.

458
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:03,268
I don't know. He's
a pretty private guy.

459
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:04,975
If he found out,
he'd...
Oh, no, no.

460
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:07,167
You don't even have
to tell him that
we talked.

461
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,059
Just point him out.

462
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:13,918
I'd be so appreciative.

463
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:16,834
[long sigh]

464
00:25:19,209 --> 00:25:20,351
I make no promises,

465
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:21,975
but I'll see what
I can do.

466
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:23,042
That's all I ask.

467
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:26,834
[door closes]

468
00:25:32,876 --> 00:25:35,975
Well. Things are looking
brighter already.

Don't you think?

470
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:38,501
What have you got there?

471
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:44,167
"Happy Honeymoon
from Blue Moon Bay."

00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:47,834
Oh, sweetheart.

[sighs]

474
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:55,018
We could talk,
if you like.

475
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:57,810
[sniffs]
Yeah, um...

476
00:25:57,834 --> 00:25:59,894
We've never been
very good at talking.

477
00:25:59,918 --> 00:26:02,935
It tends to take us places
we don't wanna go.

478
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:05,101
[sighs]

479
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:08,393
But you haven't so much
as said his name
since that day.

480
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:10,518
That can't be healthy.

481
00:26:10,542 --> 00:26:13,727
Don't you wanna...
yell, or scream,

482
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:15,876
or cry, or something?

483
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:24,999
[sighs] Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea after all.

484
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:30,834
[sniffs] No.
No, you know what?

486
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,626
This is perfect.

After what I've been through,
I deserve this.

00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:43,018
I intend to
enjoy myself,

in a drawer. They'll wrinkle!

looks so...

by dressing up.

00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:49,101
First time.

533
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:50,292
Any advice?

534
00:28:51,292 --> 00:28:52,894
Yeah. Watch out
for this guy.

535
00:28:52,918 --> 00:28:54,584

537
00:28:57,999 --> 00:28:58,975
He's mostly kidding.

538
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:01,393
Oh. Okay.
Good to know.

539
00:29:01,417 --> 00:29:02,852
[Marla] Pssst. Hey.

540
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:04,542
Is that...?

00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:07,501
[barely audible]
Oh. No...

542
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,852
Oh, thank you,
sweetheart.

00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:13,876
You're welcome.

544
00:29:15,292 --> 00:29:19,435
He, uh, he gave me
an extra portion
of wild boar.

545
00:29:19,459 --> 00:29:24,727
What is that?
Some strange island
courting ritual?

546
00:29:24,751 --> 00:29:27,310
3 hours ago, you thought
he had a cute butt.

547
00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:29,226
3 days ago, you were
getting married,

548
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:33,018
and now you're flattered
when a man gives you
exotic meat?

549
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:35,999
Please stop. I know
what he's up to.

550
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:39,709
I hope so.

You're a natural

Hey. Oh, well.

555
00:30:07,459 --> 00:30:08,975
So... this isn't
home for you?

556
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:11,518
No. Just in the summers.

557
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:12,975
Home is in Sarasota,

558
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:14,852
and my parents have
a small business there,

559
00:30:14,876 --> 00:30:16,143
so I help out.

560
00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:19,685
Oh, wow! Parents
who stay together.

561
00:30:19,709 --> 00:30:21,459
What a concept.
[chuckles]

562
00:30:22,876 --> 00:30:24,975
My dad left when
I was a little girl.

563
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:26,417
I haven't heard
from him since.

564
00:30:27,918 --> 00:30:29,768
Eh. It was what
he wanted.

565
00:30:29,792 --> 00:30:31,477
But, um...

566
00:30:31,501 --> 00:30:35,999
My-my mom is not
the easiest person
to deal with.

567
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:38,976
So, what? She, uh...

568
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,101
kick him out the door
and change the locks, or...?

570
00:30:42,918 --> 00:30:45,209
Ah. If he'd had
a choice.

571
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:51,101
Let's just say I am surprised
he stuck around as long
as he did.

572
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:53,975
I skipped out
to college as soon

573
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:56,268
as I could spell the word
"dysfunctional."

574
00:30:56,292 --> 00:30:58,059
Like, I can't even spell
"dysfunctional," so...

575

[chuckles]

576
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,975
Well, she must have
done something right.

577
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:03,975
I mean, you turned out
pretty great.

Aw...[laughs]
Stop.

at this, you know.

00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:18,018
What a morning.

709
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:21,226
Isn't this place incredible?

710
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:24,018
This place is...
incredible.

711
00:36:24,042 --> 00:36:25,975
[laughing]
Are you going somewhere?

712
00:36:25,999 --> 00:36:27,435
Mm. I have a lunch date.

713
00:36:27,459 --> 00:36:28,584
With a man?

714
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:31,935
It could happen.

715
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:34,351
Okay. Who is this
Prince Charming?

716
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:36,375
None other than
Nick Tercel, himself.

717
00:36:37,459 --> 00:36:40,727
We have a mutual
interest in horses.

718
00:36:40,751 --> 00:36:41,975
Since when?

719
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:44,810
Since I got an up-close
and personal look at him.

720
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:46,709
Woof!
Woof?

721
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:49,393
Isn't that what the kids
are saying, these days?

722
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:50,999
Only if you're 12.

723
00:36:52,834 --> 00:36:54,852
You may join us,
if you want.

724
00:36:54,876 --> 00:36:56,685
Thank you. But, um...

725
00:36:56,709 --> 00:36:59,852
I know an insincere offer
when I hear one.

726
00:36:59,876 --> 00:37:01,935
Besides, I already
have plans.

727
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:02,976
I'm learning how
to fish today.

728
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,083
Adam again?

729
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:07,602
Shannon, I hope you're
not getting too serious.

730
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:09,185
Please don't start.

731
00:37:09,209 --> 00:37:10,975
A mother worries.

732
00:37:10,999 --> 00:37:12,626
20 years too late, Mom.

733
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:16,042
Ugh. Ugh!

734
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,768
Oh, Nick.

735
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:33,560
This is beautiful.

736
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,975
And it's a
restaurant?

737
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:35,975
Yeah.

738
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:37,976
Usually, I just
call it home.

739
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,083
Come on inside.

740
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,975
One martini up,
two olives,

741
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:08,768
and lunch'll be ready
in about 20 minutes.

742
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:09,876
Great.

743
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:16,393
So...if this is
where you live,

744
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:18,602
is it a safe bet
that you're the Nick

745
00:38:18,626 --> 00:38:21,602
who owns the hotel,
as well?

746
00:38:21,626 --> 00:38:23,685
And most of the island?

747
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:24,975
Most of the island.

748
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:28,059
Well...sounds impressive
when you put it that way.

749
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:29,810
It's not Tahiti, but...

750
00:38:29,834 --> 00:38:31,999
you stick around long
enough, it'll grown on ya.

751
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:37,975
But you weren't always
in the...sand and surf
business.

752
00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:40,976
No, I was raised on
a working ranch, just
outside Flagstaff.

753
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,685
Oh. That explains
the cowboy boots.

754
00:38:43,709 --> 00:38:47,393
Ha ha. Well, my parents
used to bring me down
here when I was a kid

755
00:38:47,417 --> 00:38:49,435
to these islands,
for a vacation.

756
00:38:49,459 --> 00:38:51,894
Always seemed like
a safe place to come
back to.

757
00:38:51,918 --> 00:38:53,768
What were you...
running from, Nick?

758
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:57,685
I- I hope that's not
too...personal
a question.

759
00:38:57,709 --> 00:38:59,768
Life got complicated.

760
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:01,643
Here, it's simple.

761
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:03,292
You bought your own
paradise.

762
00:39:04,334 --> 00:39:06,393
One way to look at it.

763
00:39:06,417 --> 00:39:09,999
Now? I don't think
I could live
anywhere else.

764
00:39:11,042 --> 00:39:14,975
[laughs] What a life
you've led.

765
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:15,975
I think I could...

766
00:39:15,999 --> 00:39:17,976
listen to you talk
all day long.

767
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,975
[chuckling]

768
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:24,459
[laughing]

769
00:39:27,042 --> 00:39:30,975
[engine stops]
You crazy. You crazy.

770
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:33,975
Oh, my goodness,
I had the best
time today.

771
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:35,059
Well, you were
a natural.

772
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,393
I don't know
about that.

773
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:38,602
I think that actually might
actually be a record catch.

774
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,351
What, smallest catch
by a guest?

775
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:41,975
That's what I'm thinkin'.

776
00:39:41,999 --> 00:39:43,375
[chuckling]

777
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:48,310
So, um...

778
00:39:48,334 --> 00:39:50,185
I guess I'll...
I'll see you in
the morning,

779
00:39:50,209 --> 00:39:51,975
unless you wanna
grab a drink, or...

780
00:39:51,999 --> 00:39:53,083
Well, the morning is great.

781
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,000
Great.
I will see you then.

782
00:40:03,292 --> 00:40:04,685
Mom?

783
00:40:04,709 --> 00:40:06,518
[Marla]
I'm just changing.

784
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:08,018
How was your day?

785
00:40:08,042 --> 00:40:09,143
[laughs] Good.

786
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:10,542
Come see the catch.

787
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:20,976
[Nick] Always seemed like
a safe place to come back to,

788
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,975
if I ever wanted
to sort things out.

789
00:40:22,999 --> 00:40:24,643
Turn that off,
please.

790
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:26,975
[Marla] I hope that's not
too...personal...

791
00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:28,459
[clicks]
What is this?

792
00:40:29,876 --> 00:40:32,999
[sighs] You can take
the girl out of
the magazine, but...

793
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:35,059
You know the cliche.

794
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:37,435
Is this Nick Tercel?
Mmm.

795
00:40:37,459 --> 00:40:38,810
Why are you taping him?

796
00:40:38,834 --> 00:40:41,000
He's an interesting
person.

797
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:44,268
Is this why you got

798
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:47,018
that sudden urge to do
a bonding session with me?

799
00:40:47,042 --> 00:40:49,018
To get some story
for your magazine?

800
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:51,894
True confessions.
[sighs]

801
00:40:51,918 --> 00:40:54,310
That was part of it.
But it was never
the only reason.

802
00:40:54,334 --> 00:40:57,975
And it's not
some...story.

803
00:40:57,999 --> 00:41:00,685
It happens to be
possibly the cover

804
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:02,876
of our 25th
anniversary issue.

805
00:41:03,876 --> 00:41:05,852
Unbelievable.

806
00:41:05,876 --> 00:41:08,810
You're using this
nice guy to get a jump
on the competition.

807
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:10,602
I don't like
what you're implying.

808
00:41:10,626 --> 00:41:12,727
And I don't like
what you're doing.

809
00:41:12,751 --> 00:41:14,810
Using me, and using him.

810
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:17,185
Everybody uses
everybody, Shannon.

811
00:41:17,209 --> 00:41:18,810
The sooner you
realize that,

812
00:41:18,834 --> 00:41:20,999
the less painful your life
is going to be.

813
00:41:22,584 --> 00:41:23,975
[exhales softly]

814
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:26,417
No wonder Dad
walked out on you.

815
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:33,209
Shannon?

816
00:41:53,918 --> 00:41:55,143
Ryan.

817
00:41:55,167 --> 00:41:58,143
I need you to take
this package to
town tomorrow.

818
00:41:58,167 --> 00:41:59,768
Overnight it
to my office.

819
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:01,018
This should more
than cover it.

820
00:42:01,042 --> 00:42:03,852
Consider whatever's
left your tip.

821
00:42:03,876 --> 00:42:07,185
[sighs] And make sure
no one sees this

822
00:42:07,209 --> 00:42:08,209
before you send it.

823
00:42:09,709 --> 00:42:12,477
It's not something illegal,
is it?

824
00:42:12,501 --> 00:42:13,975
Only personal,
okay?

825
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:16,143
Very much appreciate
your discretion.

826
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:17,518
Okay?
Okay.

827
00:42:17,542 --> 00:42:18,876
Okay.
Okay.

828
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,393
[Marla] Adam.

829
00:42:38,417 --> 00:42:39,685
Adam?

830
00:42:39,709 --> 00:42:41,477
Have you seen
my daughter today?

831
00:42:41,501 --> 00:42:44,083
Yeah. You just missed her.
She just went out on a ride.

832
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:49,876
Would you put me on this,
and...point us in
the right direction?

833
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:52,226
You ride.

834
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,250
Well, of...

835
00:42:54,501 --> 00:42:56,435
Well, of all
the silly questions.

836
00:42:56,459 --> 00:42:59,810
Oh, horsey!
Oh, horsey, slow down...

837
00:42:59,834 --> 00:43:02,918
[continued whimpering]

838
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:07,560
I'm gonna take
some more photos.

839
00:43:07,584 --> 00:43:08,810
I'll catch up later.

840
00:43:08,834 --> 00:43:10,292
All right.
Have fun.

841
00:43:14,999 --> 00:43:16,101
[Marla] Shannon!

842
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:17,435
Oh, shoot!

843
00:43:17,459 --> 00:43:18,709
Oh...!

844
00:43:22,042 --> 00:43:23,018
Mother?

845
00:43:23,042 --> 00:43:26,125
Whoa! Whoa. Whoa...

846
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:34,393
[groaning]

847
00:43:34,417 --> 00:43:36,685
What are you doing
out here?

848
00:43:36,709 --> 00:43:38,435
My foot's stuck.

849
00:43:38,459 --> 00:43:39,975
[sighs]
[horse snorts]

850
00:43:39,999 --> 00:43:41,351
Shouldn't you be
back at the hotel,

851
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:42,375
playing corporate spy

852
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:44,351
I...

853
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:45,975
I should have been
up-front with you.

854
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:47,435
But I meant
what I said before.

855
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:49,810
It's not the only reason
I came out here with you.

856
00:43:49,834 --> 00:43:52,101
[stammering]
Who let you out
on your own?

857
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:53,101
Look at you.

858
00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:54,477
You're not dressed
for this,

859
00:43:54,501 --> 00:43:55,852
and you haven't
the slightest idea

860
00:43:55,876 --> 00:43:56,852
what you're doing
on a horse.

861
00:43:56,876 --> 00:43:58,083
Well, what's all the fuss?

862
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:00,268
There's no trick to it.

863
00:44:00,292 --> 00:44:01,643
You say go, and it goes.

864
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:03,226
You say stop, and...
Whoa.

865
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,417
Whoa, and it whoas.

866
00:44:05,918 --> 00:44:08,477
Oh. And when it runs away?

867
00:44:08,501 --> 00:44:10,477
Ho! Hey! Thunder!

868
00:44:10,501 --> 00:44:11,976
[horse whinnying]
No, no, no! Come back!

869
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,999
[stammers] Oh...
What do I do?

870
00:44:15,876 --> 00:44:17,059
Well...no! Shannon!

871
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:19,351
Where are you going?

872
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:20,959
Don't leave me alone here!

873
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:23,185
Honey! Wait!

874
00:44:23,209 --> 00:44:25,101
Take a little pity
on your old mom!

875
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:27,477
Wait! I'll go with you,
honey! Wait!

876
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:28,999
Here I come! Here I come!

877
00:44:41,751 --> 00:44:43,685
Well, I hope you're happy.

878
00:44:43,709 --> 00:44:45,185
There's not a sign
of them.

879
00:44:45,209 --> 00:44:47,101
The riders, the hotel...

880
00:44:47,125 --> 00:44:48,975
Oh, sweetheart.
Sweetheart.

881
00:44:48,999 --> 00:44:51,768
I-all I wanted to do
was apologize to you.

882
00:44:51,792 --> 00:44:52,975
To make you understand.

883
00:44:52,999 --> 00:44:54,101
I understand, all right.

884
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:55,975
And this has nothing
to do with me.

885
00:44:55,999 --> 00:44:57,018
It was never about me.

886
00:44:57,042 --> 00:45:00,268
My entire life has been
devoted to you.

887
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:03,975
Your entire life was devoted
to sending me away.

888
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:06,975
To schools, and camps,
and activity groups,

889
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:08,143
so you wouldn't
have to be bothered.

890
00:45:08,167 --> 00:45:09,393
Is that what you think?

891
00:45:09,417 --> 00:45:10,894
It's what I know, Mother.

892
00:45:10,918 --> 00:45:13,059
I gave you everything.

893
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:15,226
Things weren’t what I needed.

894
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:19,185
The right clothes,
and the most
exclusive academies

895
00:45:19,209 --> 00:45:22,602
couldn't make up for the fact
that I needed a mother,
not a corporate executive.

896
00:45:22,626 --> 00:45:24,268
Where is this coming from?

897
00:45:24,292 --> 00:45:27,435
From years of taking
a back seat to your work.

898
00:45:27,459 --> 00:45:29,435
The drivers who hauled
me around.

899
00:45:29,459 --> 00:45:31,975
The nannies I ate meals with.

900
00:45:31,999 --> 00:45:35,393
The generic birthday gifts
I know your assistants
picked out.

901
00:45:35,417 --> 00:45:36,393
That's not true.

902
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:39,226
Mom, all I ever needed
was you!

903
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,417
And that's the one thing
you wouldn't give me.

904
00:45:44,999 --> 00:45:45,999
[groans]

905
00:45:56,999 --> 00:45:58,810
[sighs]

906
00:45:58,834 --> 00:46:01,250
Well, it's gonna
be dark in about an hour.

907
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:03,935
We're gonna have
to camp out.

908
00:46:03,959 --> 00:46:05,751
Camp out?

909
00:46:08,042 --> 00:46:09,542
Okay. You're right.

910
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:12,393
We'll, um...

911
00:46:12,417 --> 00:46:15,393
we'll make a tent,
or something.

912
00:46:15,417 --> 00:46:17,560
Someone's bound to
notice we're gone.

913
00:46:17,584 --> 00:46:18,894
Probably not till morning.

914
00:46:18,918 --> 00:46:21,059
What are we gonna eat
while we're out here?

915
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:22,999
Here. Try this.

916
00:46:28,209 --> 00:46:29,727
Dried fish?

917
00:46:29,751 --> 00:46:32,351
The original islanders
practically lived on it.

918
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:33,975
So can you, princess.

919
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,000
[flies buzzing]

920
00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:40,792
No.

921
00:46:41,834 --> 00:46:43,999
[long sigh]

922
00:46:52,417 --> 00:46:54,542
Hmm.
[chuckles]

923
00:46:56,083 --> 00:47:00,018
Do you remember the time
you were...7 years old.

924
00:47:00,042 --> 00:47:04,101
And...you built a fort
in the living room.

925
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:05,999
And you called it
Fort Shannon.

926
00:47:07,334 --> 00:47:11,975
And we toasted marshmallows
over the 60-watt bulb

927
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:15,185
in the fake fireplace.

928
00:47:15,209 --> 00:47:17,976
Remember?
Mmm.

929
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,459
Yeah?
Yeah. I remember.

930
00:47:22,209 --> 00:47:24,059
I'm just surprised
that you do.

931
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:25,459
[whispers]
Oh, Shannon.

932
00:47:26,792 --> 00:47:29,185
[long sigh]

933
00:47:29,209 --> 00:47:30,751
You know, this isn't bad.

934
00:47:35,751 --> 00:47:37,999
Your father always wanted
to bring me here.

935
00:47:39,042 --> 00:47:40,852
To the Caribbean.
You know.

936
00:47:40,876 --> 00:47:42,167
He loved the ocean.

937
00:47:43,292 --> 00:47:45,727
And I had this dream

938
00:47:45,751 --> 00:47:49,101
that I was gonna be
a famous artist
like Gauguin,

939
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:53,876
and run off to
my own Tahiti,
and paint the natives.

940
00:47:54,876 --> 00:47:56,477
You...
Yeah.

941
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:58,435
...wanted to be
an artist.

942
00:47:58,459 --> 00:47:59,975
I didn't
tell you this?

943
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,975
Oh, yeah.

944
00:48:00,999 --> 00:48:03,518
I-I used to paint
watercolors

945
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:05,792
and your father was
my first customer.

946
00:48:07,999 --> 00:48:09,310
Boy.

947
00:48:09,334 --> 00:48:11,918
Larry was so handsome.

948
00:48:13,999 --> 00:48:15,250
And he had his own car.

949
00:48:16,626 --> 00:48:18,393
And it was love
at first sight.

950
00:48:18,417 --> 00:48:19,918
At least for me.

951
00:48:22,792 --> 00:48:24,125
[sighs]

952
00:48:26,626 --> 00:48:28,209
Does it still
hurt that much?

953
00:48:30,292 --> 00:48:31,792
Sometimes.

954
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,125
[howling]

955
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,018
What was that?

956
00:48:45,042 --> 00:48:46,999
Mm. It's probably
a wild dog.

957
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:51,268
Is the wild dog
our friend?

958
00:48:51,292 --> 00:48:52,501
Well, that depends.

959
00:48:54,083 --> 00:48:55,935
On what?

960
00:48:55,959 --> 00:48:57,876
On...how hungry he is.

961
00:48:58,999 --> 00:49:00,602
Oh, that's so funny.

962
00:49:00,626 --> 00:49:02,709
So terribly amusing.
Mm.

963
00:49:08,999 --> 00:49:10,810
[moans and groans]

964
00:49:10,834 --> 00:49:12,417
Is it morning already?

965
00:49:14,125 --> 00:49:16,185
Yeah. How'd ya sleep?

966
00:49:16,209 --> 00:49:17,975
Really well,
considering.

967
00:49:17,999 --> 00:49:19,975
[vehicle approaching]

968
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:23,268
[Marla] Oh, yes!
Someone's coming!

969
00:49:23,292 --> 00:49:25,185
Hey! Hello!
Over here!

970
00:49:25,209 --> 00:49:26,894
Over here!

971
00:49:26,918 --> 00:49:28,250
Hello!

972
00:49:29,876 --> 00:49:32,727
[both] Yay!

973
00:49:32,751 --> 00:49:33,999
[laughing]

974
00:49:35,209 --> 00:49:36,185
[shuts off engine]

975
00:49:36,209 --> 00:49:39,143
Oh, we are
so happy to see you.

976
00:49:39,167 --> 00:49:40,143
You have no idea.

977
00:49:40,167 --> 00:49:41,643
You know, I had
half my staff

978
00:49:41,667 --> 00:49:43,268
out lookin' for you
the whole night?

979
00:49:43,292 --> 00:49:44,975
Now, now.

980
00:49:44,999 --> 00:49:47,975
I know you're not happy
at having to come
and find us, but...

981
00:49:47,999 --> 00:49:49,310
Thunder ran away.
And by the...

982
00:49:49,334 --> 00:49:51,042
Yeah, well, you don't
have to explain to me.

983
00:49:52,209 --> 00:49:53,602
Just get in.

984
00:49:53,626 --> 00:49:55,667
We'll send someone back
for my horses.

985
00:49:57,584 --> 00:49:59,101
Come on. Get in.

986
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:00,584
[door opens]

987
00:50:06,209 --> 00:50:07,226
[shuts off engine]

988
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:08,250
Thanks, Nick.

989
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,602
Are we still on
for dinner?

990
00:50:12,626 --> 00:50:13,999
No. Something's
come up.

991
00:50:14,999 --> 00:50:16,792
And I think this
belongs to you.

992
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,143
This was supposed...

993
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:21,894
Ryan noticed the address.
He, uh...

994
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:23,667
He thought I should
see it.

995
00:50:25,999 --> 00:50:26,975
You know, I can explain...

996
00:50:26,999 --> 00:50:28,975
Yeah, well,
I'm sure you can.

997
00:50:28,999 --> 00:50:30,810
Style In magazine.

998
00:50:30,834 --> 00:50:33,667
Tape is labeled
"Nick, Part One."

999
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:36,042
What else do I need to know?

1000
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:41,975
Do you want me to leave?

1001
00:50:41,999 --> 00:50:43,852
No, Ms. Bates.
You paid for the time,

1002
00:50:43,876 --> 00:50:45,393
you might as well
stay and enjoy it.

1003
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,975
We'll just, uh...

1004
00:50:46,999 --> 00:50:48,975
stay out of one another's
way for the duration.

1005
00:50:48,999 --> 00:50:50,101
If you know what I mean.

1006
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:51,268
Close the door, please?

1007
00:50:51,292 --> 00:50:52,709
[starts engine]

1008
00:50:57,959 --> 00:51:00,000
Well, I'm not
gonna tell ya
"I told you so."

1009
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,685
Why not?

1010
00:51:02,709 --> 00:51:03,999
That's what
I'm thinking.

1011
00:51:06,417 --> 00:51:09,226
I haven't been honest
with anyone, and...

1012
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:10,999
now I'm paying the price.

1013
00:51:13,292 --> 00:51:15,602
[sighs]

1014
00:51:15,626 --> 00:51:17,834
What would it take
to get your trust again?

1015
00:51:20,334 --> 00:51:22,375
Mom, I'm not sure
that's possible.

1016
00:51:23,959 --> 00:51:25,560
I love you.

1017
00:51:25,584 --> 00:51:27,959
Well...I kinda have to.
You're my mother.

1018
00:51:29,584 --> 00:51:32,393
Trust ya?

1019
00:51:32,417 --> 00:51:33,751
I know you too well.

1020
00:51:42,209 --> 00:51:45,226
That's your cover story!

1021
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:46,226
I'll get another one.

1022
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,143
It's only a magazine.

1023
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:49,268
Here.

1024
00:51:49,292 --> 00:51:50,292
Join me.

1025
00:51:51,959 --> 00:51:52,975
[laughs]

1026
00:51:52,999 --> 00:51:54,976
Come on! Come on!
Get busy, here.

1027
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,393
[both laughing]

1028
00:51:56,417 --> 00:51:58,643
What have you done
with my mother?

1029
00:51:58,667 --> 00:52:00,667
Ha ha ha!

1030
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:09,975
[Shannon] I didn't buy it,
at first.

1031
00:52:09,999 --> 00:52:12,810
This...new attitude
of hers.

1032
00:52:12,834 --> 00:52:15,999
But she was determined
to prove me wrong.

1033
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:20,727
And I had to
hand it to her.

1034
00:52:20,751 --> 00:52:22,477
She pitched right in,
literally,

1035
00:52:22,501 --> 00:52:25,542
like she was possessed
with the spirit of
John Wayne.

1036
00:52:27,334 --> 00:52:30,685
By way of Paris Hilton,
maybe. But...

1037
00:52:30,709 --> 00:52:33,167
she was trying,
and I had to give her credit.

1038
00:52:34,999 --> 00:52:36,477
You know that picture
about aliens

1039
00:52:36,501 --> 00:52:38,268
taking over human bodies?

1040
00:52:38,292 --> 00:52:40,185
It was like that.
I mean, this was

1041
00:52:40,209 --> 00:52:41,185
so not my mother.

1042
00:52:41,209 --> 00:52:43,975
[moaning]
Ew. Ew!

1043
00:52:43,999 --> 00:52:47,334
Ooh! ha ha!
[both laugh]

1044
00:52:48,542 --> 00:52:50,834
[Shannon] But whoever
she was... [laughs]

1045
00:52:52,209 --> 00:52:53,999
she was beginning
to grow on me.

1046
00:52:57,999 --> 00:52:59,083
Thank you.

1047
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,602
Oh...[smooch]

1048
00:53:05,626 --> 00:53:06,792
Mm. Thank you.

1049
00:53:10,999 --> 00:53:14,185
I never knew
peace and quiet
could be so relaxing.

1050
00:53:14,209 --> 00:53:15,351
[chuckles]

1051
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:16,975
It's been years
since I fell asleep

1052
00:53:16,999 --> 00:53:19,626
without phones ringing
and the television on.

1053
00:53:20,999 --> 00:53:22,560
Who knew I could?

1054
00:53:22,584 --> 00:53:23,584
[laughs]

1055
00:53:24,751 --> 00:53:26,310
Yeah, you've been
a pretty good sport

1056
00:53:26,334 --> 00:53:27,768
these past few days.

1057
00:53:27,792 --> 00:53:29,626
Oh, thank you,
sweetie.

1058
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,375
[surf, gulls]

1059
00:53:35,542 --> 00:53:39,810
I love it when you
say things like that.

1060
00:53:39,834 --> 00:53:42,643
Well, you know.
It's-it's not
easy, letting go.

1061
00:53:42,667 --> 00:53:45,417
I never...really
got the hang of that.

1062
00:53:50,584 --> 00:53:52,167
Do you ever think
about Dad?

1063
00:53:53,792 --> 00:53:55,000
Wonder where he is?

1064
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:02,643
Sweetheart, I know
you think that
I did something

1065
00:54:02,667 --> 00:54:05,310
to drive him away.
But that's not...

1066
00:54:05,334 --> 00:54:06,999
how it was.

1067
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:10,167
We were too young.

1068
00:54:11,167 --> 00:54:12,999
And we realized it,
too late.

1069
00:54:13,999 --> 00:54:15,918
There's no one
to blame, sweetie.

1070
00:54:19,667 --> 00:54:21,375
I remember
the day he left.

1071
00:54:23,375 --> 00:54:25,935
I had a cold.
And, uh...

1072
00:54:25,959 --> 00:54:28,334
I came home early
from school.

1073
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:30,975
And he was at the door.

1074
00:54:30,999 --> 00:54:33,852
With his bags packed.

1075
00:54:33,876 --> 00:54:35,042
[sniffles]

1076
00:54:36,209 --> 00:54:38,999
He seemed so sad
I had to see him going.

1077
00:54:40,999 --> 00:54:43,209
He said you thought
it was best for us all.

1078
00:54:44,999 --> 00:54:46,059
He said that?

1079
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:47,250
That it was my idea?

1080
00:54:51,292 --> 00:54:52,999
I cried for weeks.

1081
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:59,477
And you wouldn't even
let me comfort you.

1082
00:54:59,501 --> 00:55:01,000
You only wanted him.

1083
00:55:04,209 --> 00:55:06,083
I still miss him.

1084
00:55:07,542 --> 00:55:08,876
Every day.

1085
00:55:14,042 --> 00:55:16,975
Um...I'm sure he
misses you, too.

1086
00:55:16,999 --> 00:55:19,083
And I know he'd be
proud of you.

1087
00:55:22,584 --> 00:55:23,999
But that's in the past.

1088
00:55:26,876 --> 00:55:28,999
Can't we please
just leave it there?

1089
00:55:31,626 --> 00:55:33,042
Start fresh.

1090
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:36,999
Yeah.

1091
00:55:37,999 --> 00:55:40,477
Yeah. As long as,
from now on,

1092
00:55:40,501 --> 00:55:44,250
it is total honesty
between us. Okay?

1093
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:46,999
Okay.

1094
00:55:50,667 --> 00:55:52,999
So...
So...

1095
00:55:53,999 --> 00:55:55,918
Honestly,

1096
00:55:57,125 --> 00:56:00,185
I think that you should
try to patch things up
with Nick.

1097
00:56:00,209 --> 00:56:02,393
Oh, ho ho ho.

1098
00:56:02,417 --> 00:56:04,727
There's no hope
of that.

1099
00:56:04,751 --> 00:56:06,894
I wouldn't know
where to start.

1100
00:56:06,918 --> 00:56:09,999
Well, you could start
with an apology.

1101
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:17,999
And I know just
how to do that.

1102
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:38,310
Mornin'.

1103
00:56:38,334 --> 00:56:39,975
Oh, Mr. Tercel.

1104
00:56:39,999 --> 00:56:40,999
This came for you.

1105
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,975
Should I have it sent
to your office?

1106
00:57:00,999 --> 00:57:02,792
No, just put it
back there.

1107
00:57:10,042 --> 00:57:11,143
Knock, knock.

1108
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,501
Come in.

1109
00:57:26,292 --> 00:57:28,477
This was at
the hotel front desk.

1110
00:57:28,501 --> 00:57:30,185
That's right where
I left it.

1111
00:57:30,209 --> 00:57:32,975
Everything that you
think about my mother

1112
00:57:32,999 --> 00:57:34,101
is true.

1113
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:35,727
At least it was.

1114
00:57:35,751 --> 00:57:37,975
Actually, I-I don't
think about it, Shannon.

1115
00:57:37,999 --> 00:57:40,143
Now, if you'll, uh,
excuse me,

1116
00:57:40,167 --> 00:57:41,602
there's some things
to do.

1117
00:57:41,626 --> 00:57:43,685
And when you go, if you
can take that with you...

1118
00:57:43,709 --> 00:57:46,975
Ever since I can remember,
she has pushed and fought,

1119
00:57:46,999 --> 00:57:48,894
and done whatever it took

1120
00:57:48,918 --> 00:57:50,560
to get ahead in business.

1121
00:57:50,584 --> 00:57:52,226
I always thought
it was such a shame

1122
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,268
that she robbed us
of all that time

1123
00:57:54,292 --> 00:57:55,643
we could have spent
together.

1124
00:57:55,667 --> 00:57:58,768
But...she's changing
out here.

1125
00:57:58,792 --> 00:58:00,685
At least she's
trying to.

1126
00:58:00,709 --> 00:58:03,125
Well, then, in that case,
I'm happy for you both.

1127
00:58:04,125 --> 00:58:05,125
She destroyed the tape.

1128
00:58:06,792 --> 00:58:07,810
Yeah.

1129
00:58:07,834 --> 00:58:10,268
It was a cover story
she was desperate for,

1130
00:58:10,292 --> 00:58:11,975
and she gave that up.

1131
00:58:11,999 --> 00:58:13,435
And that should
tell ya something.

1132
00:58:13,459 --> 00:58:16,351
Shannon, did your mom
send you out here
to tell me this?

1133
00:58:16,375 --> 00:58:18,999
Mm-mm. She has
no idea I'm here.

1134
00:58:43,292 --> 00:58:44,542
Huh.

1135
00:58:56,709 --> 00:58:58,143
I got your painting.

1136
00:58:58,167 --> 00:58:59,727
Thank you.

1137
00:58:59,751 --> 00:59:00,834
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

1138
00:59:01,999 --> 00:59:04,477
Well, I know I'm no match
for the elephant

1139
00:59:04,501 --> 00:59:06,518
that shows her paintings
at the Guggenheim.

1140
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:09,185
Oh, that elephant.
She's just a flash
in the pan.

1141
00:59:09,209 --> 00:59:10,975
Highly overrated.

1142
00:59:10,999 --> 00:59:12,501
Absolutely.
Mm-hm.

1143
00:59:14,125 --> 00:59:15,584
Heard you threw
that tape away.

1144
00:59:17,999 --> 00:59:18,975
Shannon told you?

1145
00:59:18,999 --> 00:59:20,435
Yes.
Oh...

1146
00:59:20,459 --> 00:59:21,975
[chuckles]

1147
00:59:21,999 --> 00:59:24,477
Well, she'll be telling
people my real age!

1148
00:59:24,501 --> 00:59:26,185
Would you rather
I didn't know?

1149
00:59:26,209 --> 00:59:27,185
Yes.

1150
00:59:27,209 --> 00:59:29,685
I mean about the tape.
Oh.

1151
00:59:29,709 --> 00:59:32,143
Well, I...
couldn't use it now,
after all that happened.

1152
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:33,518
[exasperated sigh]

1153
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:35,810
Not that I didn't want to.
I'm not a saint.

1154
00:59:35,834 --> 00:59:37,852
Really.
Just not...

1155
00:59:37,876 --> 00:59:39,975
quite as heartless
as you imagine.

1156
00:59:39,999 --> 00:59:42,143
Oh, that's good to know.

1157
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:43,935
You're not dancin'.

1158
00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:44,935
No.

1159
00:59:44,959 --> 00:59:45,999
You don't wanna
see why.

1160
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:48,560
I don't.
No.

1161
00:59:48,584 --> 00:59:50,975
Because when I was
good at it,

1162
00:59:50,999 --> 00:59:52,768
I wasn't good at it.

1163
00:59:52,792 --> 00:59:54,310
I'd just embarrass
myself.

1164
00:59:54,334 --> 00:59:56,459
Now, that's actually
something I'd like to see.

1165
00:59:57,459 --> 00:59:59,143
What, again?

1166
00:59:59,167 --> 01:00:00,435
Well, if you fall...

1167
01:00:00,459 --> 01:00:02,059
I'll catch ya.

1168
01:00:02,083 --> 01:00:04,542
Oh, there are those
who wouldn't blame you
if you didn't.

1169
01:00:06,209 --> 01:00:09,101
Gotta trust me,
don't ya?
Hm.

1170
01:00:09,125 --> 01:00:10,501
Put one hand here.

1171
01:00:13,167 --> 01:00:14,751
[laughs]
And now we step.

1172
01:00:16,999 --> 01:00:18,083
Oh, you're
a natural.

1173
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,167
[Driver]
Here we go, sir.

1174
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:35,459
Have a nice day.

1175
01:01:01,999 --> 01:01:03,602
Shannon?

1176
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:05,185
Jack.

1177
01:01:05,209 --> 01:01:07,560
[stammers]
What the hell
are you doing here?

1178
01:01:07,584 --> 01:01:09,477
Well, nice to
see you, too.

1179
01:01:09,501 --> 01:01:10,667
Who's the surfer?

1180
01:01:11,792 --> 01:01:13,975
This is Adam.
Adam, Jack.

1181
01:01:13,999 --> 01:01:14,999
And you are?

1182
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:17,226
Her fiance.

1183
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,935
My former fiance.

1184
01:01:18,959 --> 01:01:20,643
The fiance that walked out.

1185
01:01:20,667 --> 01:01:23,894
The fiance that made
a big mistake,

1186
01:01:23,918 --> 01:01:25,250
and is here
to get you back.

1187
01:01:26,999 --> 01:01:28,602
I really need
to talk to you.

1188
01:01:28,626 --> 01:01:29,975
Whoa, whoa. I'm dancing.

1189
01:01:29,999 --> 01:01:32,518
You don't just pull
a lady off the dance
floor, all right?

1190
01:01:32,542 --> 01:01:33,975
Here's how it works.

1191
01:01:33,999 --> 01:01:35,059
You ask her nice.

1192
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:37,999
And if she wants to go,
she'll go.

1193
01:01:43,542 --> 01:01:45,143
Okay. [sighs]

1194
01:01:45,167 --> 01:01:47,685
I'm sorry.

1195
01:01:47,709 --> 01:01:49,975
I really need to talk to you.
That's all I wanna do.

1196
01:01:49,999 --> 01:01:52,018
Please. I came
all this way.

1197
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:53,768
Oh. From Switzerland?

1198
01:01:53,792 --> 01:01:54,976
It gave me time
to clear my head.

1199
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,918
And-and-and-
figure things out.

1200
01:01:58,292 --> 01:01:59,999
I know what I want, now.

1201
01:02:01,999 --> 01:02:03,792
At least hear what
I have to say.

1202
01:02:13,542 --> 01:02:14,602
[Nick] Moon'll
be up, soon.

1203
01:02:14,626 --> 01:02:16,101
I hear it's gonna
be a full one.

1204
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:18,727
[Marla] You know,
it's really hard
to imagine

1205
01:02:18,751 --> 01:02:20,226
that you walked
up there.

1206
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:23,185
[Nick] Yeah, sometimes
it seems like a dream.

1207
01:02:23,209 --> 01:02:24,975
When I went up there,
my perspective changed.

1208
01:02:24,999 --> 01:02:26,185
Uh-huh.

1209
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:28,185
And I didn't wanna
come back and just do

1210
01:02:28,209 --> 01:02:31,185
ads for running shoes,
and for orange juice.

1211
01:02:31,209 --> 01:02:32,209
Nah.

1212
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,185
But you were a hero.

1213
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:38,999
All the...parades,
and headlines.

1214
01:02:40,876 --> 01:02:42,810
Yeah, well.
Walkin' away
from that?

1215
01:02:42,834 --> 01:02:44,083
Nothing easy
about it.

1216
01:02:46,292 --> 01:02:47,459
You know, it just...

1217
01:02:48,999 --> 01:02:50,000
it seemed...

1218
01:02:51,417 --> 01:02:53,209
People wanted to know
what I was doing.

1219
01:02:54,667 --> 01:02:56,975
And the- the more
that I denied
the rumors,

1220
01:02:56,999 --> 01:02:58,459
the darker they got.

1221
01:02:59,999 --> 01:03:02,667
So I just had to
get away somewhere,
and find myself.

1222
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:05,751
And you chose here.

1223
01:03:06,876 --> 01:03:08,602
Can you blame me?

1224
01:03:08,626 --> 01:03:10,560
No. I can't.

1225
01:03:10,584 --> 01:03:11,584
Well...

1226
01:03:12,584 --> 01:03:14,393
that's it.

1227
01:03:14,417 --> 01:03:17,018
Wouldn't have made
much of a story anyway,
I guess.

1228
01:03:17,042 --> 01:03:19,999
Oh...
I'm so sorry, Nick.

1229
01:03:23,042 --> 01:03:24,375
What are you
sorry about?

1230
01:03:25,999 --> 01:03:26,999
Hm?

1231
01:03:42,584 --> 01:03:43,560
I'm listening.

1232
01:03:43,584 --> 01:03:45,768
No matter how many lies
I told myself,

1233
01:03:45,792 --> 01:03:47,999
no matter how...
scared I got,

1234
01:03:49,626 --> 01:03:51,518
there was one fact
that never changed.

1235
01:03:51,542 --> 01:03:53,518
One argument

1236
01:03:53,542 --> 01:03:54,918
I couldn't get around.

1237
01:04:02,083 --> 01:04:03,083
I love you.

1238
01:04:07,918 --> 01:04:10,351
Where were those words
when I needed to hear them?

1239
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:13,018
Do you have any idea
what you put me through?

1240
01:04:13,042 --> 01:04:15,351
Any idea at all?

1241
01:04:15,375 --> 01:04:18,894
[laughing]

1242
01:04:18,918 --> 01:04:22,125
I am on a honeymoon
with my mother.

1243
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:26,999
I'm not leaving here
without you.

1244
01:04:27,999 --> 01:04:28,975
I mean it.

1245
01:04:28,999 --> 01:04:31,059
I'm gonna stay.

1246
01:04:31,083 --> 01:04:32,935
And I'm gonna fight for you,

1247
01:04:32,959 --> 01:04:35,083
as long as it takes.

1248
01:04:38,667 --> 01:04:39,959
Suit yourself.

1249
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:43,125
I have to get back
to the dance.

1250
01:04:44,292 --> 01:04:45,292
Well...

1251
01:04:46,999 --> 01:04:48,751
[sighs]

1252
01:04:54,626 --> 01:04:55,975
Can I help you?

1253
01:04:55,999 --> 01:04:57,560
You have my bag.

1254
01:04:57,584 --> 01:05:00,310
And I'm gonna need
a room for a few nights.

1255
01:05:00,334 --> 01:05:01,518
Put it on this.

1256
01:05:01,542 --> 01:05:02,727
Sorry, but we're full.

1257
01:05:02,751 --> 01:05:05,975
[scoffs] Okay.
I get it.

1258
01:05:05,999 --> 01:05:07,602
Last minute and all.

1259
01:05:07,626 --> 01:05:09,143
Just charge whatever
you want.

1260
01:05:09,167 --> 01:05:10,975
Let me try this again.

1261
01:05:10,999 --> 01:05:12,975
We have a waiting list

1262
01:05:12,999 --> 01:05:14,518
8 months long
at the moment.

1263
01:05:14,542 --> 01:05:16,185
But if you'd like
to make a reservation...

1264
01:05:16,209 --> 01:05:17,435
Are you tellin' me
there's nothing?

1265
01:05:17,459 --> 01:05:18,852
No room? No bed?

1266
01:05:18,876 --> 01:05:20,226
No anything?

1267
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,417
I see we don't have
a language barrier,
after all.

1268
01:05:26,667 --> 01:05:27,768
Here's your bag.

1269
01:05:27,792 --> 01:05:29,209
Now if you'll excuse me.

1270
01:05:32,834 --> 01:05:33,999
[sighs]

1271
01:05:48,999 --> 01:05:51,059
Say hello.

1272
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:52,542
[horse grumbles]

1273
01:05:53,751 --> 01:05:54,727
[horse sniffs]

1274
01:05:54,751 --> 01:05:55,727
Oh...
[horse grunts]

1275
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:56,792
Ho...!

1276
01:06:00,918 --> 01:06:03,351
Morning.
What...

1277
01:06:03,375 --> 01:06:04,626
What time is it?

1278
01:06:05,626 --> 01:06:06,975
Oh, I'd say
it's about time

1279
01:06:06,999 --> 01:06:08,602
for you to start
movin' on.

1280
01:06:08,626 --> 01:06:10,059
Excuse me?

1281
01:06:10,083 --> 01:06:12,768
Well, this here's
a private beach, son.
You can't sleep here.

1282
01:06:12,792 --> 01:06:16,310
[laughing nervously]
It's okay. I'm a guest
from the hotel.

1283
01:06:16,334 --> 01:06:18,518
I- I mean,
I have a room.

1284
01:06:18,542 --> 01:06:19,975
I paid for a room.

1285
01:06:19,999 --> 01:06:21,435
It's just occupied.

1286
01:06:21,459 --> 01:06:24,167
Well, why don't you try
to sort that out
by tonight, okay?

1287
01:06:25,999 --> 01:06:26,976
Have a good one.

1288
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,334
Come on, Thunder.
[horse whinnies]

1289
01:06:39,834 --> 01:06:41,143
You look like hell.

1290
01:06:41,167 --> 01:06:42,810
Nice to see you, too,
Mrs. Bates.

1291
01:06:42,834 --> 01:06:44,226
Shannon told me
you were here.

1292
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,810
What'd you do?
Sleep on the beach?

1293
01:06:45,834 --> 01:06:47,975
I had no choice.

1294
01:06:47,999 --> 01:06:49,975
I'm lost without
your daughter.

1295
01:06:49,999 --> 01:06:51,643
I can't eat.
I can't sleep.

1296
01:06:51,667 --> 01:06:54,310
I knew I didn't like you.

1297
01:06:54,334 --> 01:06:55,894
You're just like my ex.

1298
01:06:55,918 --> 01:06:57,351
Excuse me?

1299
01:06:57,375 --> 01:06:58,975
You don't care what
she's been through.

1300
01:06:58,999 --> 01:07:00,935
It's all about you.

1301
01:07:00,959 --> 01:07:03,727
What you want,
and how you feel.

1302
01:07:03,751 --> 01:07:05,810
Just because you can't
hold onto your husband,

1303
01:07:05,834 --> 01:07:06,810
don't blame me.

1304
01:07:06,834 --> 01:07:07,834
What?

1305
01:07:08,999 --> 01:07:09,975
I didn't mean that.

1306
01:07:09,999 --> 01:07:11,268
[sighs]

1307
01:07:11,292 --> 01:07:12,643
I'm tired.

1308
01:07:12,667 --> 01:07:13,999
I don't know what
I'm saying.

1309
01:07:15,125 --> 01:07:17,560
I don't blame you.
You are who you are.

1310
01:07:17,584 --> 01:07:19,018
Nothing can change that.

1311
01:07:19,042 --> 01:07:22,976
But I am not letting Shannon
make the same mistake I did.

1312
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,975
Mrs. Bates, I know
you're upset at me.

1313
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:26,185
And I'm sorry.

1314
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:28,768
But I'm determined
to make things right.

1315
01:07:28,792 --> 01:07:29,975
Doesn't everybody
deserve a second chance?

1316
01:07:29,999 --> 01:07:30,975
I mean, come on.

1317
01:07:30,999 --> 01:07:32,643
Shannon isn't here.

1318
01:07:32,667 --> 01:07:34,059
What is it you want?

1319
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:37,310
Right now, I would like
to use your shower,
if you don't mind.

1320
01:07:37,334 --> 01:07:39,018
I did pay for it,
after all.

1321
01:07:39,042 --> 01:07:41,167
I think your parents
did that.

1322
01:07:43,876 --> 01:07:45,250
Okay. [sighs]

1323
01:07:47,083 --> 01:07:48,417
Lock up when you leave.

1324
01:07:49,709 --> 01:07:50,709
Thanks.

1325
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:02,976
Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.

1326
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I needed that.

1327
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:08,292
Missed you at
the island excursion,
this morning.

1328
01:08:09,417 --> 01:08:10,393
Yeah.

1329
01:08:10,417 --> 01:08:11,935
I needed some
time to think.

1330
01:08:11,959 --> 01:08:12,999
Hmm.

1331
01:08:14,417 --> 01:08:15,685
You and the, uh...

1332
01:08:15,709 --> 01:08:16,999
preppy a thing again?

1333
01:08:19,083 --> 01:08:20,375
Why? Would it bother you?

1334
01:08:22,292 --> 01:08:24,518
I'm just sayin' I don't
like to see people get
taken advantage of,

1335
01:08:24,542 --> 01:08:25,584
that's all.

1336
01:08:26,999 --> 01:08:29,393
And you think he's
taking advantage of me.

1337
01:08:29,417 --> 01:08:30,976
You got a good heart.
He knows that.

1338
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,042
It wouldn't be hard.

1339
01:08:33,501 --> 01:08:36,292
I wanted him, yeah.
But I certainly didn't
need him.

1340
01:08:37,709 --> 01:08:38,709
What about now?

1341
01:08:39,999 --> 01:08:40,999
I don't know.

1342
01:08:43,709 --> 01:08:44,876
Maybe.

1343
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:52,226
I'm just not sure
I could ever really
trust him again.

1344
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:54,417
Kinda like your mom,
with your dad.

1345
01:08:56,542 --> 01:08:58,351
Hey.

1346
01:08:58,375 --> 01:08:59,975
Why don't you
get changed,

1347
01:08:59,999 --> 01:09:02,101
and we'll get in some
serious beach time
this afternoon.

1348
01:09:02,125 --> 01:09:03,626
How's that sound?

1349
01:09:05,542 --> 01:09:07,125
Come on. It'll be fun.
[laughs]

1350
01:09:08,292 --> 01:09:09,501
Okay.

1351
01:09:11,626 --> 01:09:13,685
And I'll see you
in about...20 minutes?

1352
01:09:13,709 --> 01:09:14,834
Sounds good.
Okay.

1353
01:09:15,834 --> 01:09:16,935
[laughs]

1354
01:09:16,959 --> 01:09:18,477
[Man] Hey,
watch it!
Sorry.

1355
01:09:18,501 --> 01:09:20,626
[shower running]

1356
01:09:22,209 --> 01:09:24,685
Mom, it's me!

1357
01:09:24,709 --> 01:09:25,999
You gonna be long?

1358
01:09:27,918 --> 01:09:29,709
[shower stops]

1359
01:09:34,501 --> 01:09:35,685
What are you doing here?

1360
01:09:35,709 --> 01:09:36,685
Takin' a shower.

1361
01:09:36,709 --> 01:09:37,685
You wanna join me?

1362
01:09:37,709 --> 01:09:38,975
I thought you left.

1363
01:09:38,999 --> 01:09:40,852
I tried to tell you
yesterday.

1364
01:09:40,876 --> 01:09:43,792
I'm here to win you back,
and I'm not taking no
for an answer.

1365
01:09:44,834 --> 01:09:46,143
Don't make me call someone.

1366
01:09:46,167 --> 01:09:47,393
Shannon.

1367
01:09:47,417 --> 01:09:49,310
I'll do whatever
you want. Name it.

1368
01:09:49,334 --> 01:09:51,768
I'll-I'll crawl.
I'll-I'll beg.

1369
01:09:51,792 --> 01:09:53,810
Stop it. [stammers]

1370
01:09:53,834 --> 01:09:55,975
There-there's nothing
that you can say.

1371
01:09:55,999 --> 01:09:57,417
[sighs]

1372
01:09:58,999 --> 01:10:01,125
What if I said I could
find your father for you?

1373
01:10:03,709 --> 01:10:04,975
No one knows where he is.

1374
01:10:04,999 --> 01:10:06,975
Hmm. Not even
your mother?

1375
01:10:06,999 --> 01:10:11,518
No. She knows I would do
anything to see him. If she
had any idea where he was...

1376
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:12,518
But she does.

1377
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:16,143
Your mother knows
exactly where he is.

1378
01:10:16,167 --> 01:10:17,459
She's known all along.

1379
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:26,059
I-I think I-I twisted it
back there in the surf.

1380
01:10:26,083 --> 01:10:27,643
Okay.

1381
01:10:27,667 --> 01:10:29,059
Well...

1382
01:10:29,083 --> 01:10:30,876
you let me know
if this hurts.

1383
01:10:34,292 --> 01:10:35,643
Better?

1384
01:10:35,667 --> 01:10:36,918
Much.

1385
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:39,975
Oh. Oh, right there.
[gasps]

1386
01:10:39,999 --> 01:10:41,059
Oh, a little bit more...

1387
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:44,834
Oh. Oh. Ooooh...

1388
01:10:45,834 --> 01:10:46,975
That's much better.

1389
01:10:46,999 --> 01:10:47,976
Hi.

1390
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,602
Hope we're not
interrupting.

1391
01:10:49,626 --> 01:10:50,626
What's wrong?

1392
01:10:51,834 --> 01:10:54,268
I'm just...wondering
what happened to all that

1393
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:56,059
honesty we promised
each other?

1394
01:10:56,083 --> 01:10:57,852
What are you
talking about?

1395
01:10:57,876 --> 01:10:59,975
I wanna know where
my father is.

1396
01:10:59,999 --> 01:11:00,975
I've always told you.

1397
01:11:00,999 --> 01:11:02,518
We don't know where
your father is.

1398
01:11:02,542 --> 01:11:05,226
No-no-no-no. We don't
know, but I hear
that you do.

1399
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:06,602
Where would you get
that idea?

1400
01:11:06,626 --> 01:11:07,975
[Jack] From me.

1401
01:11:07,999 --> 01:11:10,727
I overheard you on the phone,
at the chapel in Boston.

1402
01:11:10,751 --> 01:11:13,018
It sounded to me like
you were trying to make sure

1403
01:11:13,042 --> 01:11:14,518
that dear old Dad
wasn't gonna be there.

1404
01:11:14,542 --> 01:11:16,975
And I felt that
I owed it to Shannon
to tell her the truth.

1405
01:11:16,999 --> 01:11:18,310
Did you keep him away?

1406
01:11:18,334 --> 01:11:20,852
I wasn't trying to
do that at all.

1407
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:22,975
Then you admit it.

1408
01:11:22,999 --> 01:11:24,101
You know where he is.

1409
01:11:24,125 --> 01:11:27,477
Sweetheart, I know you
can't understand this,

1410
01:11:27,501 --> 01:11:29,435
but I had my reasons.

1411
01:11:29,459 --> 01:11:30,459
Where?

1412
01:11:31,709 --> 01:11:32,852
Shannon,
sweetheart...

1413
01:11:32,876 --> 01:11:34,393
I don't want you excuses
or your lies.

1414
01:11:34,417 --> 01:11:36,935
You just tell me
where he is.
I wanna know.

1415
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,125
I deserve to know.

1416
01:11:41,834 --> 01:11:45,393
He runs a boat tour business
in the Florida Keys.

1417
01:11:45,417 --> 01:11:47,975
He has for some time now.

1418
01:11:47,999 --> 01:11:49,727
That's an easy trip
from here.

1419
01:11:49,751 --> 01:11:50,975
But please don't go,
darling.

1420
01:11:50,999 --> 01:11:52,351
Not until we have
a chance to talk.

1421
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:54,143
Stop it, Mom. Just stop.

1422
01:11:54,167 --> 01:11:56,167
Honey...ow, damn it!

1423
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,810
Gee, I'm sorry,
Mrs. Bates.

1424
01:12:01,834 --> 01:12:04,351
If I'd known this would
have caused a problem
between you and Shannon...

1425
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:07,975
You...have no idea
what you've done.

1426
01:12:07,999 --> 01:12:09,852
But now that you have,

1427
01:12:09,876 --> 01:12:14,226
don't you dare let her
do this by herself.

1428
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:16,542
She needs someone
there for her.

1429
01:12:23,918 --> 01:12:25,125
Oh, God...

1430
01:12:34,918 --> 01:12:37,727
[Marla] My husband
never wanted a child.

1431
01:12:37,751 --> 01:12:41,709
He walked out one day,
and never came back.

1432
01:12:44,334 --> 01:12:45,894
And I promised myself

1433
01:12:45,918 --> 01:12:49,560
I would never depend
on a man again.

1434
01:12:49,584 --> 01:12:52,250
And I raised Shannon to be
her own person, too.

1435
01:12:53,334 --> 01:12:55,727
[sighs]

1436
01:12:55,751 --> 01:12:58,000
Don't you think
she deserves
to know all this?

1437
01:12:59,167 --> 01:13:00,975
Oh, I could never
tell her the details.

1438
01:13:00,999 --> 01:13:03,101
He is her father.

1439
01:13:03,125 --> 01:13:06,667
Yeah, but...now she's
assumed that you're
the one to blame.

1440
01:13:08,125 --> 01:13:10,709
Well, I didn't say
it was a perfect plan.

1441
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:15,393
Are you always
this understanding,

1442
01:13:15,417 --> 01:13:17,602
or is this just
smoke and mirrors,

1443
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:19,310
to make me think
you're terrific?

1444
01:13:19,334 --> 01:13:22,143
No. No tricks.
Nothing up my sleeves,

1445
01:13:22,167 --> 01:13:24,894
and...[stammers]
I'm just an ordinary guy.

1446
01:13:24,918 --> 01:13:26,727
Oh. Ha! No.

1447
01:13:26,751 --> 01:13:28,976
Not an ordinary guy.

1448
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,250
Trust me.
[sighs]

1449
01:13:33,417 --> 01:13:35,143
Thank you.

1450
01:13:35,167 --> 01:13:36,975
You're welcome.

1451
01:13:36,999 --> 01:13:39,852
Okay. So now she gets
to the Keys, and...

1452
01:13:39,876 --> 01:13:41,209
she meets her father.
Then...

1453
01:13:42,792 --> 01:13:44,727
what's she goin'
to find?

1454
01:13:44,751 --> 01:13:47,999
[sniffs]
[sighs]

1455
01:13:55,083 --> 01:13:58,975
[seagulls, cawing]

1456
01:13:58,999 --> 01:14:00,250
Are you ready to meet him?

1457
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:02,834
I've been ready all my life.

1458
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:08,459
[knocking]

1459
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:15,999
Hey. Can I help you?

1460
01:14:17,167 --> 01:14:18,975
You guys looking
for a tour?

1461
01:14:18,999 --> 01:14:20,560
We might not be the biggest,

1462
01:14:20,584 --> 01:14:21,999
but we are the best.

1463
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:26,435
Actually, we're looking
for Larry Bates.

1464
01:14:26,459 --> 01:14:27,626
Well.

1465
01:14:30,042 --> 01:14:31,042
Dad?

1466
01:14:32,999 --> 01:14:33,999
Shannon?

1467
01:14:37,792 --> 01:14:38,792
Oh, God.

1468
01:14:40,292 --> 01:14:41,292
Shannon.

1469
01:14:46,501 --> 01:14:48,459
Well, uh... come in!

1470
01:14:49,501 --> 01:14:51,167
Come in. Please.

1471
01:14:55,751 --> 01:14:57,083
This place is a mess.

1472
01:14:59,542 --> 01:15:00,975
If I'd know you were
coming, I...

1473
01:15:00,999 --> 01:15:03,501
Dad, I didn't come
to see your office.

1474
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:07,727
Could I- could I
maybe, umm...

1475
01:15:07,751 --> 01:15:09,185
get a...hug?

1476
01:15:09,209 --> 01:15:10,709
Of course.

1477
01:15:11,834 --> 01:15:12,834
Of course you can.

1478
01:15:14,959 --> 01:15:16,602
You have no idea

1479
01:15:16,626 --> 01:15:18,477
how long I've been
dreaming of this.

1480
01:15:18,501 --> 01:15:20,477
[nervous chuckle]

1481
01:15:20,501 --> 01:15:22,268
This is fine.

1482
01:15:22,292 --> 01:15:24,101
This is just fine.

1483
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:25,560
Uh, Grace?

1484
01:15:25,584 --> 01:15:28,935
Hey, Grace, come
and meet my daughter.

1485
01:15:28,959 --> 01:15:29,999
Your what?

1486
01:15:31,834 --> 01:15:33,310
Oh, it certainly is.

1487
01:15:33,334 --> 01:15:36,999
You look just like
those photos your Mom
sends now and then.

1488
01:15:38,292 --> 01:15:39,852
My Mom sends photos?

1489
01:15:39,876 --> 01:15:42,975
This is Grace, and...
sit down. Please.

1490
01:15:42,999 --> 01:15:44,751
So...you must be Jack.

1491
01:15:45,751 --> 01:15:46,727
Yeah, that's right.

1492
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:47,751
The new husband.

1493
01:15:48,959 --> 01:15:50,975
[stammers] You knew
I was getting married.

1494
01:15:50,999 --> 01:15:52,518
Yeah. I heard
somethin' about it.

1495
01:15:52,542 --> 01:15:53,602
[Grace] Something?

1496
01:15:53,626 --> 01:15:55,101
Your mother called
a couple of times,

1497
01:15:55,125 --> 01:15:57,268
trying to get this guy
to haul his ass up

1498
01:15:57,292 --> 01:15:58,477
to Boston for
the ceremony.

1499
01:15:58,501 --> 01:16:00,894
[Jerry] We had
a huge tour that day.

1500
01:16:00,918 --> 01:16:03,975
And weddings always
bring back bad
memories for me.

1501
01:16:03,999 --> 01:16:06,685
But congratulations.

1502
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:08,975
Good-lookin' guy.

1503
01:16:08,999 --> 01:16:10,268
Thanks. But, uh...

1504
01:16:10,292 --> 01:16:11,975
We-we're not
married.

1505
01:16:11,999 --> 01:16:12,999
It didn't happen.

1506
01:16:14,209 --> 01:16:16,351
Well, thank God
for that.

1507
01:16:16,375 --> 01:16:19,602
I mean, I think you're both
better off for it. I do.

1508
01:16:19,626 --> 01:16:21,810
A romantic guy,
my Larry.

1509
01:16:21,834 --> 01:16:24,226
I fell for that trap, once.

1510
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:25,310
Never again.

1511
01:16:25,334 --> 01:16:27,975
You walked out?
It was your idea.

1512
01:16:27,999 --> 01:16:30,768
Well, it's not something
I'm proud of.

1513
01:16:30,792 --> 01:16:31,975
I'm sure your mother...

1514
01:16:31,999 --> 01:16:34,393
[sighs] drives it into
your head every day.

1515
01:16:34,417 --> 01:16:37,975
You know, fills your head
will all kinds of junk
about me.

1516
01:16:37,999 --> 01:16:40,125
Maybe she never
said a thing.

1517
01:16:42,083 --> 01:16:43,459
Maybe she let me think...

1518
01:16:44,542 --> 01:16:45,751
it was all her fault.

1519
01:16:46,999 --> 01:16:48,975
And you were still some

1520
01:16:48,999 --> 01:16:50,292
knight in shining armor.

1521
01:16:51,999 --> 01:16:53,975
Shannon.

1522
01:16:53,999 --> 01:16:55,542
Let's get down to it.

1523
01:16:56,999 --> 01:16:57,999
Why are you here?

1524
01:16:59,334 --> 01:17:01,852
If it's about money,
I can barely
make ends meet...

1525
01:17:01,876 --> 01:17:03,792
No! I- I just wanted
to see you!

1526
01:17:05,626 --> 01:17:09,292
I have made so many excuses
for you over the years.

1527
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:14,584
Why you never wrote.
Wh-why you never
tried to get in touch.

1528
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:19,393
I even imagined that Mom
was hiding your letters,

1529
01:17:19,417 --> 01:17:20,918
trying to keep us apart.

1530
01:17:21,999 --> 01:17:22,975
Dad!

1531
01:17:22,999 --> 01:17:24,310
Okay, I get it.

1532
01:17:24,334 --> 01:17:27,018
And I know what you
wanna hear, Shannon.

1533
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:29,643
But the fact is,
some of us aren't cut out

1534
01:17:29,667 --> 01:17:32,477
to be tied down by...
wives, and children.

1535
01:17:32,501 --> 01:17:33,975
And that's just
the way I am.

1536
01:17:33,999 --> 01:17:35,560
It doesn't make me
a bad person.

1537
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:38,393
Damn it! Didn't you once
wonder where I was,

1538
01:17:38,417 --> 01:17:40,059
or what I was doing? I...

1539
01:17:40,083 --> 01:17:42,018
Me? No.

1540
01:17:42,042 --> 01:17:44,351
Because there was never
a doubt in my mind

1541
01:17:44,375 --> 01:17:45,975
you'd be fine.

1542
01:17:45,999 --> 01:17:47,709
And look at the way
you turned out.

1543
01:17:48,999 --> 01:17:50,959
You are your mother's girl.

1544
01:17:56,667 --> 01:17:57,792
Yes.

1545
01:17:59,999 --> 01:18:01,375
Yes, I am.

1546
01:18:05,918 --> 01:18:07,999
I just didn't realize it,
till right now.

1547
01:18:20,999 --> 01:18:22,999
Don't be like this.
Don't go away mad.

1548
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,542
I'm not going away mad.

1549
01:18:27,584 --> 01:18:29,125
I'm just going away.

1550
01:18:33,626 --> 01:18:36,417
[seagulls, cawing]

1551
01:18:38,334 --> 01:18:39,935
So we'll pack up your stuff,

1552
01:18:39,959 --> 01:18:41,375
and head back to Boston. Okay?

1553
01:18:43,125 --> 01:18:44,894
Shannon?

1554
01:18:44,918 --> 01:18:47,542
How many chances did
Mom have to tell me
the truth?

1555
01:18:48,542 --> 01:18:50,975
To tell me
what a jerk he is.

1556
01:18:50,999 --> 01:18:52,975
And not once did she
let me think he was

1557
01:18:52,999 --> 01:18:54,334
anything but wonderful.

1558
01:18:55,834 --> 01:18:56,975
Wait a minute.

1559
01:18:56,999 --> 01:18:58,685
You heard what he said.

1560
01:18:58,709 --> 01:18:59,975
Well, if you read
between the lines,

1561
01:18:59,999 --> 01:19:03,185
your mother was demanding
and self-centered and just...

1562
01:19:03,209 --> 01:19:04,975
just drove him away.

1563
01:19:04,999 --> 01:19:07,894
Okay. He's nobody's idea
of Father of the Year,

1564
01:19:07,918 --> 01:19:11,310
but he did do his best.

1565
01:19:11,334 --> 01:19:12,751
Taxi!

1566
01:19:13,751 --> 01:19:15,975
He what?

1567
01:19:15,999 --> 01:19:18,000
Did you hear the same
conversation I just heard?

1568
01:19:19,959 --> 01:19:21,975
I got that he obviously
wasn't ready to get married,

1569
01:19:21,999 --> 01:19:23,792
and she just
pushed him into it.

1570
01:19:25,584 --> 01:19:28,083
Well, I guess you can
relate to that, can't you?

1571
01:19:29,083 --> 01:19:30,810
I don't condone
what he did.

1572
01:19:30,834 --> 01:19:32,393
I'm just saying
he had his reasons.

1573
01:19:32,417 --> 01:19:33,852
Take your hand off the door.

1574
01:19:33,876 --> 01:19:35,143
Hey. I'm just trying
to point out

1575
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:37,935
that your mother isn't
totally blameless here.

1576
01:19:37,959 --> 01:19:40,643
Actually...it looks like
you struck out twice,

1577
01:19:40,667 --> 01:19:42,768
parentally speaking.

1578
01:19:42,792 --> 01:19:45,083
But you still have me,
sweetie. Now, move over.

1579
01:19:46,959 --> 01:19:48,643
Okay. I need you
to listen really,

1580
01:19:48,667 --> 01:19:50,959
really carefully, Jack.

1581
01:19:53,999 --> 01:19:55,042
I don't want you.

1582
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:01,975
I can't leave you
alone, here.

1583
01:20:01,999 --> 01:20:03,975
Only at the altar, I guess.

1584
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:06,310
A person makes one
little mistake.

1585
01:20:06,334 --> 01:20:09,101
I come all this way,
and this is the thanks
that I get?

1586
01:20:09,125 --> 01:20:10,975
Well, welcome to
your life, Shannon.

1587
01:20:10,999 --> 01:20:12,542
You're just like
your mother.

1588
01:20:16,999 --> 01:20:18,477
And that might just be

1589
01:20:18,501 --> 01:20:20,999
the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

1590
01:20:24,999 --> 01:20:27,852
Please go, driver.
Yes, Ma'am.

1591
01:20:27,876 --> 01:20:29,250
Whoa!

1592
01:20:39,999 --> 01:20:41,999
[sighing, sniffling]

1593
01:20:46,999 --> 01:20:48,351
My baby.

1594
01:20:48,375 --> 01:20:51,101
My sweet baby.

1595
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:52,101
[camera beeps]

1596
01:20:52,125 --> 01:20:55,268
[crying and laughing]

1597
01:20:55,292 --> 01:20:56,310
[camera beeps]

1598
01:20:56,334 --> 01:20:58,334
[whispering]
You are so beautiful.

1599
01:20:59,999 --> 01:21:02,185
[knocking on door]

1600
01:21:02,209 --> 01:21:03,209
Come in.

1601
01:21:08,999 --> 01:21:10,999
Front desk tells me
you're checkin' out.

1602
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:15,059
Shannon's not coming back.

1603
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:18,626
And I've embarrassed myself
enough for one vacation.

1604
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:21,975
Well, I, uh...

1605
01:21:21,999 --> 01:21:23,542
thought this might be
somethin' you'd like.

1606
01:21:25,751 --> 01:21:28,226
I just hope that you
can read the writing.

1607
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,351
My teachers always said
I should have been a doctor.

1608
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:31,999
[laughs]

1609
01:21:33,542 --> 01:21:34,768
What is this?

1610
01:21:34,792 --> 01:21:35,852
It's my story.

1611
01:21:35,876 --> 01:21:37,226
In my own words,
of course.

1612
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:39,852
I figure now's as
good a time as any
to get it out,

1613
01:21:39,876 --> 01:21:41,185
get it behind me, and...

1614
01:21:41,209 --> 01:21:43,185
and maybe I can move on
with my business,

1615
01:21:43,209 --> 01:21:45,852
and not have to look
over my shoulder
every 5 minutes,

1616
01:21:45,876 --> 01:21:47,059
for reporters.

1617
01:21:47,083 --> 01:21:48,459
The vultures.

1618
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,975
Are you sure you want me
to have this?

1619
01:21:54,999 --> 01:21:56,125
Well, uh...

1620
01:21:57,459 --> 01:21:58,999
that's only if you're
still interested.

1621
01:22:00,125 --> 01:22:01,477
Thank you, Nick.

1622
01:22:01,501 --> 01:22:03,000
Really sorry
you're leaving.

1623
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,560
And if you ever...

1624
01:22:05,584 --> 01:22:07,975
find yourself out this
way again, well...

1625
01:22:07,999 --> 01:22:11,185
And if you ever
get to the city.

1626
01:22:11,209 --> 01:22:12,501
[sighs]

1627
01:22:13,501 --> 01:22:17,518
You know...if we
use these pages,

1628
01:22:17,542 --> 01:22:20,310
we're gonna need an updated
photo to go with them.

1629
01:22:20,334 --> 01:22:22,975
I- I've never been very
comfortable in front
of a camera.

1630
01:22:22,999 --> 01:22:24,018
I warn ya.
Hey.

1631
01:22:24,042 --> 01:22:27,143
I know some terrific
professionals in California.

1632
01:22:27,167 --> 01:22:30,334
We can...put you together
with one of them.

1633
01:22:31,334 --> 01:22:32,727
Los Angeles.
Yeah.

1634
01:22:32,751 --> 01:22:35,417
That's where I did
my last TV interview.

1635
01:22:36,959 --> 01:22:38,143
Maybe this is the time.

1636
01:22:38,167 --> 01:22:39,709
Huh?

1637
01:22:40,959 --> 01:22:42,018
You know, they...

1638
01:22:42,042 --> 01:22:45,435
they broadcast
in color, now.

1639
01:22:45,459 --> 01:22:47,626
Hm.
Mm-hm.

1640
01:23:11,375 --> 01:23:12,999
[cutting engine]

1641
01:23:17,501 --> 01:23:18,501
Hey.

1642
01:23:20,918 --> 01:23:21,999
Hey.

1643
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:25,435
What happened to, uh...

1644
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:26,518
Mr. Right?

1645
01:23:26,542 --> 01:23:27,542
Hmm.

1646
01:23:28,626 --> 01:23:30,999
Yeah, the- the honeymoon
is definitely over.

1647
01:23:32,751 --> 01:23:35,626
Well, you know what?
I enjoyed the time
that we spent together.

1648
01:23:37,999 --> 01:23:39,999
No, the pleasure was
definitely mine.

1649
01:23:45,542 --> 01:23:48,643
Oh, aren't we
the civilized ones,
hmm?

1650
01:23:48,667 --> 01:23:50,477
No harm, no foul.

1651
01:23:50,501 --> 01:23:52,501
Smile. Shake hands.

1652
01:23:58,167 --> 01:23:59,975
I was never much
for handshakes.

1653
01:23:59,999 --> 01:24:01,959
[laughs]
Yeah. Me, neither.

1654
01:24:06,501 --> 01:24:08,975
I should go up
and see my mother.

1655
01:24:08,999 --> 01:24:10,999
I'll walk ya. Come on.
Hm.

1656
01:24:15,918 --> 01:24:16,894
[both] Oh...

1657
01:24:16,918 --> 01:24:18,643
So, uh, what's next
for you?

1658
01:24:18,667 --> 01:24:20,999
Well, summer's almost over.
So I'll...

1659
01:24:22,417 --> 01:24:25,685
go back to the mainland,
and back to my real life,
I guess.

1660
01:24:25,709 --> 01:24:26,999
Hm.

1661
01:24:28,584 --> 01:24:30,125
Ready for that scuba lesson
you promised?

1662
01:24:31,125 --> 01:24:32,250
Be right there.

1663
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,125
Take care of yourself.

1664
01:24:39,709 --> 01:24:41,975
Well, like my mom
always taught me,

1665
01:24:41,999 --> 01:24:43,584
if I don't, who will?

1666
01:24:45,626 --> 01:24:46,999
Enjoy your swim.

1667
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:49,834
I will.
Hmm.

1668
01:25:01,751 --> 01:25:02,727
Well, hi.

1669
01:25:02,751 --> 01:25:03,751
[door closes]

1670
01:25:04,959 --> 01:25:06,834
I didn't expect you
to come back.

1671
01:25:07,834 --> 01:25:08,999
Did you see your father?

1672
01:25:12,125 --> 01:25:13,417
Yeah.

1673
01:25:14,999 --> 01:25:15,999
How was he?

1674
01:25:18,999 --> 01:25:20,999
Not the man
I thought he was.

1675
01:25:22,626 --> 01:25:23,626
Sweetheart.

1676
01:25:25,584 --> 01:25:26,999
I'm so sorry.

1677
01:25:27,999 --> 01:25:29,292
Why didn't you
ever tell me?

1678
01:25:30,999 --> 01:25:33,643
Because you didn't need
to know the truth.

1679
01:25:33,667 --> 01:25:35,685
You needed a father.

1680
01:25:35,709 --> 01:25:37,935
And you needed him
to be a hero.

1681
01:25:37,959 --> 01:25:40,542
And I wanted
to give you that.

1682
01:25:43,959 --> 01:25:44,959
Oh, Mom.

1683
01:25:47,334 --> 01:25:48,417
I love you.

1684
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:51,209
I really,

1685
01:25:52,209 --> 01:25:53,626
really love you.

1686
01:25:54,999 --> 01:25:56,876
Have I ever told you that?

1687
01:25:57,876 --> 01:25:59,975
Not like that.
Ohh...

1688
01:25:59,999 --> 01:26:00,975
Oh...

1689
01:26:00,999 --> 01:26:03,852
[sniffles]
Oh...

1690
01:26:03,876 --> 01:26:05,852
And I love you,
too, sweetie.

1691
01:26:05,876 --> 01:26:07,375
Hm.

1692
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,167
Mm!

1693
01:26:14,709 --> 01:26:16,560
Are you leaving?

1694
01:26:16,584 --> 01:26:19,810
Yeah. I don't want them
to discover

1695
01:26:19,834 --> 01:26:21,999
that they can run that
magazine without me.

1696
01:26:23,626 --> 01:26:24,792
How about you?

1697
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:26,999
[sniffs, clears throat]

1698
01:26:28,167 --> 01:26:30,560
Well... [laughs]

1699
01:26:30,584 --> 01:26:32,018
Think you could...

1700
01:26:32,042 --> 01:26:35,268
make room for a guest,
maybe, till I

1701
01:26:35,292 --> 01:26:37,959
get a job, and...figure
a few things out?

1702
01:26:40,083 --> 01:26:42,083
You know I could.

1703
01:26:48,501 --> 01:26:50,935
[Shannon] So we went back
to Los Angeles,

1704
01:26:50,959 --> 01:26:53,975
and I landed a job with
a major publishing company.

1705
01:26:53,999 --> 01:26:55,351
[Marla] And ladies
and gentlemen,

1706
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:57,167
I have one more
thing to say.

1707
01:26:58,959 --> 01:27:01,393
I love this cover.

1708
01:27:01,417 --> 01:27:03,852
I love this issue.

1709
01:27:03,876 --> 01:27:05,268
Thank you, thank you,
thank you!

1710
01:27:05,292 --> 01:27:08,310
[Shannon] Okay, it helps
to have friends
in high places.

1711
01:27:08,334 --> 01:27:09,935
But it all worked out.

1712
01:27:09,959 --> 01:27:12,810
Happy endings aren't
just for fairy tales.

1713
01:27:12,834 --> 01:27:14,292
Wow!
Made it.

1714
01:27:16,584 --> 01:27:18,975
Nice to
see you.

1715
01:27:18,999 --> 01:27:20,626
Mmmm.

1716
01:27:21,751 --> 01:27:23,393
You look very
handsome.

1717
01:27:23,417 --> 01:27:25,042
Handsome all the way
down to your toes.

1718
01:27:28,083 --> 01:27:29,477
Thank you.

1719
01:27:29,501 --> 01:27:31,935
[Shannon] Nick's spending
more time in L.A. now,

1720
01:27:31,959 --> 01:27:33,999
and Mom and I
are much closer...

1721
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:38,042
thanks to the best
honeymoon of my life.

1722
01:27:39,125 --> 01:27:41,626
Sorry. Um,
thank you.

1723
01:27:42,709 --> 01:27:44,518
Ahem.

1724
01:27:44,542 --> 01:27:45,542
See ya around.
See ya.

1725
01:27:46,667 --> 01:27:48,709
[Shannon] The best one
so far, anyway.

1726
01:27:50,167 --> 01:27:53,477
But if there should be
another one in the future,

1727
01:27:53,501 --> 01:27:56,768
I know where we can get
a room with a view
of the sunset.
