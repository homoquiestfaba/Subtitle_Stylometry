Hi.

It's Anthony.

8
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,760
I wasn't sure if I should call you, but...

9
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,480
I've been thinking about yesterday, and...

10
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,640
About us

11
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,480
Everything got a bit strange

12
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,480
Maybe we could meet some day and talk?

13
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,920
Call me if you have the time...

14
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,880
...and want to

15
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,800
You've got my number and everything so...

00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,010

Hi!

23
00:02:23,864 --> 00:02:23,975
Hi

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,064
What's up?

25
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,800
Nothing much. How about you?

26
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,000
Where were you yesterday?

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,360
At home

28
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,920
I was looking for you.
And what's more, Lisa was there

29
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,249
Lisa?

30
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:37,583
Lisa was there

31
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,200
Yeah that's right. She called me

32
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,800
So what did you say?

33
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,671
Erm...

34
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,960
Come on!

35
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,800
You've got to talk to her!

36
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:58,542
Erik!

37
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
Hi!

38
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,120
How are you?

39
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,904
I'm fine

40
00:03:09,224 --> 00:03:10,396
That's good!

41
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm fine too

42
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,640
I was thinking maybe we should talk.

43
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,218
About what?

44
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,440
You know

45
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,538
No

46
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,120
Maybe we could go somewhere?

47
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,360
Why? Can't we talk here?

48
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,920
Where's your girlfriend?

49
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,280
Elin?

50
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,160
Or whatever her name is

51
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,680
See you

52
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,000
Hi. This is Anthony's voicemail

53
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,840
I'm afraid I can't answer right now

I don't know what you've been imagining

57
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,200
You mean nothing to me

58
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,560
I don't want you to call me any more

59
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,640

Hi

72
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,632
Maybe we should spend some time together
now before you leave?

73
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,018
Talk to me at least!

74
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,314
Okay

75
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
What is it?

76
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,840
Isabella what have I done?

77
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,200
I love you

78
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,320
Erik...

79
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,040
You've been acting a bit strange lately

80
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:42,501
Is everything alright?

81
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Yes, of course

82
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,880
You know that you can talk to me

83
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,760
You know that, right?

84
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,783
What's up?

85
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,040
How's it going?

86
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,680
Did you have a nice time last Saturday?

87
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,144
What?

88
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,040
With Anthony...

89
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,040
What the fuck are you talking about?

90
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
Nothing

91
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,320
My bad

92
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,640
Who is it?

93
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,680
I guess they want me to work tomorrow

94
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,200
Aren't you going to answer?

95
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,720
Pick up the phone!

96
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,807

105
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,240

106
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,040

Stuck in front of the mirror again?

114
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,280
You won't win any beauty contest, believe me

115
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,400
Bring Isabella! We're waiting for you

116

120
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,560
You fucking faggot!

121
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,360
Do you really think that
there's something between us!?

122
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,240
What happened means nothing to me

123
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,013
I don't want to see you ever again

124
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,280

125
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,600

You've ruined my life

134
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,560
What are you talking about?

135
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,374
You've ruined my life!

136
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,560
What are you talking about?
What the hell do you mean?

137
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,990
I'm saying that you've ruined my life!

138
00:18:00,015 --> 00:18:02,015
What the fuck is the matter with you?

139
00:18:05,463 --> 00:18:06,580


140
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,880
Meet me tomorrow

141
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,755
Hi!

142
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:41,295

144
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,800

149
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,320
Er...

150
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,166

151
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,020
Sure

152
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,215
Our relationship...

153
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,160
Are you comfortable with it?

154
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,437
Aren't you?

155
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,116
Yes...

156
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,413

I'm just thinking that we...

159
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,840
I'm just thinking too much

160
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,855
Have you been seeing someone?

161
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,069
No!

162
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,160
I'm just thinking...

163
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,720
I'd just like to know that
we want the same thing

164
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,880
I just want it to be simple

165
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,360
Yes

166
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm coming back soon.
Did you want anything?

167
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,560
Coffee. Thank you

Hi

181
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,760
I got your message

182
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,760
I just wanted to say that
you mean a lot to me

183
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,800
I'm gonna miss you

I'm gonna miss you too

185
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,920
Sorry. But it was someone I had to talk to

186
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,112
Maybe we should see each other another day

187
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,167
Yeah...

188
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,200
It's probably best

189
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,653
Hi. It's Anthony

190
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,480
I've arrived in London

191
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,240
It's great to be here. Exciting...

192
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,880
To do something. Get away for a while

193
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,360
I'm lodging with a couple

194
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,840
It's gonna work out well

195
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,571
I just called to see how you were doing

196
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:04,641
I realized that I barely know anything about you

197
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,160
Hope to hear from you soon

Director of Photography: Mattias Pollak

200
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,440
Aris!

201
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,877
Yes, mom?

202
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,960
It's very muddy, mom...

203
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,255
Walk a little faster Ris,
we're gonna be late!

204
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,920
I’m trying, mom...It’s not that easy.

205
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,320
Come on, Aris!

206
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,920
Hurry, hurry!

207
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,040
Come on, run! Just run!

208
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,040
Coming mom! Just hold up!

209
00:29:17,043 --> 00:29:23,793


210
00:29:25,408 --> 00:29:27,288
Aris, let’s go!

211
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,121
Patience, mom.

212
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,615
Sir, we apologize for our tardiness.

213
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,160
Yes, I’m Haji Jaelani.
I’ll be officiating this engagement ceremony.

214
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,080
They’ve been waiting a while.

215
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,218
Please do come in quickly.

216
00:29:44,126 --> 00:29:45,480
Apologies everyone!

217
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,640
We’re very sorry for being late, Mr. Фауси.

218
00:29:48,665 --> 00:29:49,549
Gita...

219
00:29:49,574 --> 00:29:51,054
Friends and family, please come in!

220
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,000
Please do make yourselves at home!

221
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,840
Let’s all thank the grace of God...

222
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,400
for providing us with this joyous day,
full of much anticipation...

223
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,320
especially for the family members of the groom
and also for Mr. Фауси.

224
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,120
Now the family of the groom
will present the bride with...

225
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:31,560
red rice, brand new clothes,
and two million Rupiah in gold.

226
00:30:31,766 --> 00:30:33,240
They are also adding...

227
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,064
one prize-winning rooster.

228
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,975
So, with that, Mr. Фауси

229
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,360
and your daughter...

230
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,681
will you both accept this family’s marriage proposal?

231
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,600
We accept.

232
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,720
Next matter at hand...

233
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,120
We will plan to conduct the wedding ceremony on...

234
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:23,320
Now these are pictures I took on a trip to New York
about... <i>lima<i> (five) years ago.

235
00:31:23,492 --> 00:31:25,561


236
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,440
Question, can anyone...

237
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,684
you can use your <i>ka...kamus<i> (dictionary)...

238
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,240
<i>KA-mus<i> (dictionary)!

239
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,920
synonym for...

240
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,102
Gedung... Building, Building!

241
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,500
Anyone?

242
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,693
Yeah, Aris?

243
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,200
It's skyscraper?

244
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,520
Yeah! Good!

245
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,747
Can we spell it?

246
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,075
Skyscraper!

247
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,960
See you all tomorrow!
Can you leave the pictures on the desk, please?

248
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,520
Uhhh, Mr.Peter, can I keep this photo?

249
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Of course!

250
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,080
Can, can I see the photo?

251
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,400
This is my favorite photo...so...

252
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,880
Just look after it.

253
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,560
I'll see you tomorrow.

254
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,160
What's up, mom?

255
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,880
Why so serious?

256
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,360
They just gave us a crap ton of homework today.

257
00:33:50,566 --> 00:33:51,818
What's going on?

258
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,080
I'd like you to...

259
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,643
draw for me.

260
00:34:03,494 --> 00:34:05,895
Okay, I'm gonna continue with my stuff.
Stop harassing me...

261
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,903
or they’ll never get done.

262
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,640
Come, let me take a look at you.

263
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,080
Your hair is getting way too long...

264
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,520
especially the sides.

265
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,600
I'll ask the barber to come by and cut it tomorrow.

266
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,680
For your big day next week...

267
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,312
Okay?

268
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,040
It's pouring quite hard, sir.

269
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,880
Yeah, there's a scripture study tonight
at my guest house.

270
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,120
If it's not raining too hard,
you will be there, right?

271
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,920
I'll try my best, sir. I have to help my mom first.

272
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,320
Oh...look at that, your neck looks very weak.

273
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,274
Do you ever exercise?

274
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,289
I try to, sir, at home.

275
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,896
I try to.

276
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,800
Okay, we will definitely find time to exercise with me.

277
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,935
Your neck has to be taut.

278
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,521
I'll see you later, okay?

279
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,440
- Morning!
- Morning, Sir!

280
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,735
Morning!

281
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,205
Morning, mister!

282
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,200
Your main responsibility is
to make your wife happy.

283
00:38:34,036 --> 00:38:37,080
Do you know the key to a successful marriage?

284
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,080
It's right here.

285
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,320
The horse's tail...

286
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,400
The horse's hair.

287
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,560
Do you know how to use it?

288
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,920
Here, take a few strands and slowly wrap it.

289
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,681
Your “thing” right here has to be taut.

290
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,720
Can't be too flaccid.

291
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,387
And remember...

292
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,960
The most important thing before inserting...

293
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,040
...is this.

294
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,815
Your “thing” has to be...

295
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,199
...hard!

296
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,080
Rock hard!

297
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,912
Now, touch it.

298
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,975
Touch it!

299
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,514
Come on!

300
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,605
Go ahead!

301
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,236
Great!

302
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,291
Like a real man!

303
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,300
Gita!

304
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,055
You're okay, right?

305
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,115
I'm fine.

306
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,455
Are you sure?

307
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,480
Yeah...

308
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,733
This horse hair stinks.

309
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,480
So, your dad ordered me to come fetch you.

310
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,112
Oh...You didn’t come here by your own volition?

311
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:24,280
Just now inside your house,
I felt that something’s not right.

312
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,280
What do you mean?

313
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:31,400
Well... Indeed, there was a very nasty “stench”
that just wasn’t “normal.”

314
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,680
Oh yeah! That’s the smell of the horse hair!

315
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,680
Oh, I guarantee that’s not it.

316
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,975
So then?

317
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,252
You.

318
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,015
What, mom?

319
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,343
What else do you want?

320
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,775
Aren't you satisfied?

321
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,320
I just want to talk.

322
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,920
This is your opportunity.

323
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,938
What opportunity?

324
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,094
What are you on about this time?

325
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,360
You will have a family.

326
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,093
And I’m going to be suddenly happy?

327
00:41:13,118 --> 00:41:14,465
Is that what you think?

328
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,095
It’s that easy?

329
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,560
I’m sure. I’m certain this is the answer.

330
00:41:19,932 --> 00:41:22,452
You don’t know what I’m feeling.

331
00:41:22,477 --> 00:41:23,495
I know...

332
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,495
I know this whole thing is very hard for you.

333
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,579
And you’re a...

334
00:41:26,604 --> 00:41:28,284
Did you see what they did to me?

335
00:41:29,021 --> 00:41:30,640
They absolutely humiliated me.

336
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,120
- This will make everything better...
Red rice again? You're going insane!

337
00:41:44,145 --> 00:41:45,495
Try it!

338
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,285
- Try it, Aris!
Stop this, please!

339
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,613
Aris?

340
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,360
Can I come in?

341
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,466
Yeah.

342
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,069
Thank you.

343
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,131
I like your hair.

344
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,200
This place is messy.

345
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:56,040
Yeah... I'm sorry, I will clean it.

346
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,000
What's going on?

347
00:44:15,087 --> 00:44:17,037
I don't want to get married.

348
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:04,084
I think about the future

349
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,147
All the time

350
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,850
No, Harvey!

351
00:49:18,971 --> 00:49:20,229
I'm so sorry!

352
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,680
- Hello
- Harvey!

353
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,320
It's ok. I'm just glad he's using
his tongue and not his teeth!

354
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,600
Erm, it's a she. She's a lover not a fighter.

355
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,720
Oh! A pretty lady named Harvey!

356
00:49:30,339 --> 00:49:31,454
Yes, sir

357
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,146
Well it's nice to meet you, Harvey

358
00:49:33,171 --> 00:49:34,298
I'm Ryan

359
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,483
So polite!

360
00:49:37,604 --> 00:49:38,772
And you are?

361
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,935
Oh, er

362
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,560
I'm, I'm Eric

363
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,120
Nice to meet the both of you

364
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,640
Hey! Erm...

365
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,880
This is crazy but...

366
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,800
You wanna come with me?

367
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,240
Come with you?

368
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,136
Where to?

369
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,880
I don't know...

370
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
A show? I'm going to a show...

371
00:50:09,449 --> 00:50:11,089
It's a band you've never heard of

372
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:14,760
Oh well... I only listen to bands
I've never heard of

373
00:50:16,274 --> 00:50:17,524
Perfect!

374
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,938
Come on

375
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,520
Erm... I'm not really sure I can

376
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,680
I should feed Harvey and...

377
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,640
I should probably just stay in

378
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,723
Yeah. You're probably right

379
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,240
Staying in while the world whirls around
outside here is a much better idea

380
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,280
Well, avoiding the world is my default setting

381
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,520
Well... let's deviate from the default

382
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,341
Come on!

383
00:50:44,184 --> 00:50:45,349
Walk with me

384
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,232
I don't bite!

385
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,436
I'm a lover not a fighter

386
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,480
"I only listen to bands I've never heard of"
Who says that!?

387
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,600
Harvey you like this shirt, right?

388
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,813
Here we go...

389
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,480
Water... I should have some water

390
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,596
He is so cute!

391
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,920
Oh, sorry Harvey. Go!

392
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,825
You look great!

393
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,200
Thanks... you too

394
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,458
Thanks

395
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,160
So... where's the show?

396
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:44,600
Oh er... it should be somewhere
around here I think

397
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,534
Yep

398
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,300
This way

399
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,660
So where are you from?

400
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,846
Here

401
00:51:57,112 --> 00:51:57,295
Oh yeah?

402
00:51:57,112 --> 00:51:57,295
I've lived here my whole life

403
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,120


404
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,031
You?

405
00:52:01,549 --> 00:52:02,883
Around...

406
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,055
I'm not from here I'm just visiting
the city for a couple of days

407
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,141
So...

408
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:11,166
Do you start every sentence with 'so'?

409
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,763
Yeah it's a habit

410
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,400
I guess I get a little nervous

411
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,800
How are you liking the city?

412
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,973
I love it

413
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,520
I'm not used to being so surrounded

414
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,080
Surrounded by what?

415
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:33,600
Everything. The sounds, sirens, food... music!

416
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,921
I spent the last two years in places
where you'd swear the Earth is flat but...

417
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,999


418
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:38,740


419
00:52:38,765 --> 00:52:40,280
Here you can feel it spinning

420
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:44,400
When you live here long enough
it's just your head that spins

421
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,095
Well done continuing the metaphor!

422
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,040
Past or the future?

423
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,053
What?

424
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:58,040
Would you go back in time
or live 50 years in the future?

425
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,004
Wow...

426
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,598
Well, let's see...

427
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,356
Past

428
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,206
Really?

429
00:53:05,231 --> 00:53:07,055
- Yeah the past
- Why?

430
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:12,040
I don't know... it's more predictable,
you know what comes next...

431
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,720
That is the saddest thing I've ever heard

432
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,023
What!?

433
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,960
In the past you could bet on sports
or invest in Google...

434
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,680
Oh so it's about money?

435
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,965
No!

436
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,320
But what if the world turns to shit in 50 years?

437
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,480
It's all underwater... or a nuclear winter

438
00:53:29,505 --> 00:53:31,415
Woah, what if it's amazing?

439
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,640
What if we've cured cancer or colonized Mars?

440
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,320
Imagine! A world with no greed or hunger

441
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,280
A brotherhood of man

442
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,017
Am I supposed to ignore the fact
that you just quoted John Lennon?

443
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,560
Well if you're gonna quote someone...

444
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,320
So...

445
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,000
Are you seeing anyone?

446
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,189
Nope

447
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,163
Are you?

448
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,663
No

449
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,400
So you're really not afraid of the future?

450
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,160
No

451
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,080
I mean I don't think so I just...

452
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,640
I just live by the motto:
'prepare for the worst and hope for the best'

453
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,120
Are you a boy scout or something?

454
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,311
'Always be prepared'

455
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,215
Huh?

456
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,600
It's the boy... never mind

457
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,760
- Well this light's taking forever
- Yeah

458
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:17,480
Is er... is this concert in this city
or are we walking across the state?

459
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,360
Yeah it's somewhere around here

460
00:55:20,385 --> 00:55:21,255
Oh okay...

461
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,160
I don't know the city at all
so you're just gonna have to trust me

462
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,160
- Do you know where we're going?
- Hm, I do not... Forward?

463
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,249
Wow... ok, well this is officially crazy

464
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,280
We just met and now we're wandering
the streets kissing each other?

465
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,240
What's wrong with that?

466
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,620
Wandering the streets kissing strangers?

467
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,320
Seems like it should be on the To Do list

468
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,320
Stop thinking so much, just go with it

469
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,080
We barely even know each other

470
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Well...

471
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,800
Let's get to know each other

472
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,800
I would never do this... normally

473
00:56:15,366 --> 00:56:16,766
Do you want me to stop?

474
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,560
Not really

475
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,380
What's wrong?

476
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,009
Nothing

477
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:38,920
You nervous?

478
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,760
I should be...

479
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,480
Are you prepared for the worst?

480
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,360
I'm... hoping for the best

481
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,680
We should keep going

482
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,600
You get awful quiet

483
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,360
Sorry. I was just thinking

484
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,680
You seem to do a lot of that

485
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,787
I can't figure out why I said yes
when you asked me to come with you

486
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,520
Gee. Thank you!

487
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,600
No I didn't mean it like that, I meant like...

488
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:40,760
What is it that made tonight different?

489
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,640
Someone could see us...

490
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,440
So what?

491
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,784
You're crazy!

492
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,207
Wait wait wait!

493
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,640
I think your mind and your body
want different things

494
00:58:25,665 --> 00:58:27,585
It's just too fast

495
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,375
It's too easy

496
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,880
Just relax

497
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,320
This can be whatever you want it to be

498
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,200
Like we fucked, or fell in love...

499
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,040
Why would you say that?

500
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,169
Say what?

501
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,160
I don't know... just saying that

502
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,215
I'm not gonna say, I'm...

503
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,440
I don't know what to say.

504
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:58,040
Your overthinking is making me overthink

505
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,800
Well maybe you should think before you speak

506
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,580
I'm saying you shouldn't jump a mile down the road
before you've taken a single step

507
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:05,572


508
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,480
I don't even know why I'm here

509
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,680
I don't know you

510
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:14,623
After tonight you're going to be gone so...

511
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:14,741
- You don't know what's going to happen after tonight
- But I do know

512
00:59:14,648 --> 00:59:16,262


513
00:59:16,287 --> 00:59:17,287


514
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,387
And I'm the one who's going to get hurt
so let's just walk away while we still can

515
00:59:19,387 --> 00:59:21,495


516
00:59:21,442 --> 00:59:24,160


517
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,160
Walk away from what? Nothing's happened yet

518
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,120
You're freaking out because you think
you know how it's all gonna end

519
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,501
It ends with me alone

520
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,680
It always does

521
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,800
I don't know why I did this

522
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,880


523
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,000
You're determined to push people away because
you're afraid of being alone

524
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,881
Maybe I am

525
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,400
Hey!

526
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Hey I'm sorry, ok?

527
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,659
I fucked up

528
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,840
I think about the future

529
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,741
All the time

530
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,120
I picked the past because I thought maybe...

531
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:31,160
Maybe I can go back and fix some things

532
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,907
But that's not how it works

533
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,800
The reality is you just... make different mistakes

534
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,800
Even bigger ones

535
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,760
Well, maybe we should go our separate ways

536
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,800
Maybe we shouldn't...

537
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,280
Maybe we should, I don't know...

538
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,000
It just doesn't make any sense

539
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,282
The odds are against us.
It probably wouldn't work

540
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,760
The odds could be in our favor

541
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,760
It probably could go either way

542
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,695
Come on Harvey!

543
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,400
- Woah!
- I'm so sorry!

544
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,000
She looks vicious!

545
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:02,040
Oh no... she's a lover. Not a fighter

546
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,320
Who was that?

547
01:03:21,682 --> 01:03:22,755


548
01:03:22,909 --> 01:03:25,509
- Stand still, I
don't want to mess this up.

549
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:27,800
- I'm not going
to look too girly, am I?

550
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,040
- Please, you're gonna look beautiful.

551
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,644
- How much trouble do you
reckon we're going to be in

552
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,695
when we get home tomorrow?

553
01:03:32,669 --> 01:03:33,830


554
01:03:33,855 --> 01:03:35,720
- Dude, you've gotta forget about

555
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,365
Mrs. Robinson and Dungog for tonight,

556
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,335
this is about you and me
being right here, right now,

557
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:39,920


558
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,680
and we're going to have the
best night of our fucking lives.

559
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:43,898
- Yes.

560
01:03:43,923 --> 01:03:45,920
I'm excited.
- Me too.

561
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,625
We'll be great, you'll be great.

562
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:49,295
This is it, man.
- Totally.

563
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,720
I just hope this guy's not a skeez.

564
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:52,880
- What was his name again?

565
01:03:52,905 --> 01:03:53,678
- Theo.

566
01:03:53,703 --> 01:03:55,863
- Can I see his profile?

567
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,520
- So that tells us nothing.

568
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:01,680
- No.

569
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,560
But he did invite us to
a party, which is cool.

570
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,800
With a lot of inner-city
yuppies, I can imagine.

571
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,920
- See ya later, drongos of Dungog.

572
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,913
- If Duncan Mansfield could see us now.

573
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:12,175
- He'd probably punch us both.

574
01:04:11,938 --> 01:04:13,600


575
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,920
- He's such a prick.

576
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,479
Are you ready?

577
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,251
- 63.

578
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:56,760
61.

579
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,157
59.

580
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,087
This is it.

581
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,634
Okay.

582
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,895
- You right?

583
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,560
- Yeah, let's do this.

584
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,960
- Can you see him?

585
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:40,935
Yeah, yeah, that's him.

586
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,240
- Cool.

587
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,473
Well, I'll see you later.

588
01:05:44,498 --> 01:05:45,880
- You can stay if you want.

589
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,040
- No, it's cool.

590
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,120
- Oh my god Erica, it's
fine, you can stay.

591
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,339
Theo.

592
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,360
- Well, hello.

593
01:05:53,385 --> 01:05:55,400
- Hi, I'm Tyler.

594
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,043
- You must be Erica.

595
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,920
- Enchantee, Theo.

596
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,680
- Your costumes look funky,

597
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:05,877


598
01:06:05,902 --> 01:06:06,713
you guys went all out, I see.

599
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:09,160
- Oh, thank you.

600
01:06:06,738 --> 01:06:09,160
We decided to dress up for our
big debut in the big smoke,

601
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,960
and nobody else here seems to
have gotten the memo though.

602
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:23,120
- Well, um, Erica and I
might go and grab a drink.

603
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,680
Just a sec?

604
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,240
- Yeah, no worries.

605
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,560
See you soon.

606
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:28,677
- Yep.

607
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:33,896
- Eh, he's cute.

608
01:06:38,314 --> 01:06:40,070
- Well, I guess we didn't need the vodka.

609
01:06:40,095 --> 01:06:42,119
- That's $20 I'm never gonna get back,

610
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,361
that's the real tragedy here.

611
01:06:42,144 --> 01:06:43,480


612
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,640
- How did you get a
bottle of vodka for $20?

613
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:48,320
- It's called Erkiloff,
it tastes like death.

614
01:06:48,486 --> 01:06:50,750
- Might still need some later
for some liquid courage.

615
01:06:50,775 --> 01:06:51,855
- Absolutely.

616
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:54,880
Well, I might skeddaddle,
give you guys some time.

617
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,280
- You definitely don't have to.

618
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,280
- No, I want to.

619
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,337
I'm gonna go find round peg
in this party of squares.

620
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,423
Sorry.

621
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,920
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to.

622
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,720
Remember, there's no rush.

623
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:10,175
- And yet.

624
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,160
- Well, stay safe.

625
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,772
I'm gonna be right here if you need me.

626
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:18,014
- Thanks, mom.

627
01:07:17,797 --> 01:07:19,160


628
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:23,451
- Hey.

629
01:07:28,042 --> 01:07:30,548
- So what's the name of your
latest Grindr boy, then, hey?

630
01:07:30,573 --> 01:07:31,979
- Shut up.

631
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,895
Hey, you're back.

632
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,040
- I am.

633
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,960
Cheers.
- Cheers.

634
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,520
So where'd you say you were from, again?

635
01:07:47,719 --> 01:07:48,840
- It's Dungog.

636
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,800
'Bout an hour north of Newcastle.

637
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,240
- Yeah, what's it like there?

638
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,920
- Um, it's quiet.

639
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,600
Yeah, definitely keen
to move here next year,

640
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,520
be around people more like us.

641
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,040
- Your makeup's nice.

642
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,560
- Mmmm.

643
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,720
Thank you, it's L'Oreal Paris.

644
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,360
- Is it really?

645
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:13,360
- No, it's from K-Mart.

646
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,160
Guess this wasn't really the
right party for make-up hey.

647
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,000
- I wouldn't sweat it.

648
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,720
So, do you wanna come back
to my room and hang out?

649
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:42,440
- Yeah, sure.

650
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:44,520
Yeah, um.

651
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,080
I'll meet you upstairs in a minute.

652
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:49,280
I'll just go check on Erica first.

653
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:51,880
- Yeah, sure.

654
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:55,560
It's down on the right.

655
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:57,360
- Okay.

656
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:05,800
- Knock-knock.

657
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:06,920
- Hi.

658
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,760
- Hi.

659
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:09,760
Here you go.

660
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,920
- Erica gave you the all clear, then?

661
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,720
- Yeah, well, um.

662
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,600
She suggested that we celebrate

663
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,400
with some nice social lubricant.

664
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,120
I mean, um, glass of nice wine.

665
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,960
What year is this from?

666
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:29,800
It's um,

667
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:31,800
very nice drop.

668
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,600
- Yeah, it is.

669
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,800
- Look, there's a bathroom downstairs.

670
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:15,280
Can you take off the make-up?

671
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,200
- I--

672
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:21,400
- I'm just not really into femme guys.

673
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:54,960
- That is hilarious, and so classic Terry.

674
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,600
- Erica, we're going.

675
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,200
- Thank god.

676
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,280
- Look, I just think
that guy's an asshole,

677
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:19,640
and we should probably stay clear

678
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,560
of anybody like that next year.

679
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:22,800
- Yeah.

680
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:23,960
- Look, the important thing is

681
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,360
that we don't let that ruin our night.

682
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,760
We can still save this.

683
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:31,560
- Erica, I think I'd rather just go home.

684
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,360
- Okay, baby boy, let's go.

685
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,120
Hold the phone.

686
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,200
I think we're saved.

687
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:08,000
- Oh my god, you guys look amazing.

688
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:09,800
- Finally some recognition.

689
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,440
- Whereabouts have you come from?

690
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:12,640
- Dungog.

691
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,720
- Oh, is that the club on Oxford?

692
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,560
- Yeah, it's pretty exclusive,

693
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:18,480
but it's also kind of gross,

694
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,000
you didn't miss out on much.

695
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:24,600
- Well, you know, if you guys
wanna come hang out with us.

696
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:28,640
- We've actually got a bottle
of unfinished Russia's finest,

697
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,560
if you wanted to share it.

698
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:34,960
- That's literally the best
news I've had all night.

699
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:25,960
Honey?

700
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:29,087
Let's move in together.

701
01:14:33,908 --> 01:14:35,219
Yeah...

702
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,415
Don't get so excited!

703
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:43,869
I am. But...

704
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,240
Just say if you don't want to.

705
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,680
Yeah, but... I dunno...

706
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,400
- I'm thinking about it.
- Thinking about what?

707
01:14:53,834 --> 01:14:55,626
What the fuck is that?

708
01:14:55,655 --> 01:14:58,600
<i>(The Mousetrap)

709
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:02,840
- Don't try them on again, Michel!
- But I need the perfect fit!

710
01:15:03,081 --> 01:15:07,000
So... we were on the couch,
chilling out, fooling around.

711
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:09,400
That fuckin' mouse appears.

712
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,920
She starts screaming
"Michel, get rid of it!"

713
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,160
Good luck with him!

714
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,760
I go "Why me?"

715
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:17,840
She goes like
"I hate mice. Get rid of it please!"

716
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,480
- Why didn't you do it?
- Mice freak me out.

717
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,920
You! Scared of mice!
You're joking?

718
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,280
You really are scared of mice?

719
01:15:28,007 --> 01:15:29,061
I'm not sure...

720
01:15:29,086 --> 01:15:31,600
You're just afraid
to move in with her.

721
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,175
It's always scary at the beginning.

722
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,829
Why should I take care of it ?

723
01:15:34,854 --> 01:15:37,454
Because I'm a man?
I can't be scared, is that it?

724
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,920
Tell her then.

725
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,800
Come on, you know girls...
What's she gonna say?

726
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,320
- What do you think?
- Charlotte is great!

727
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,040
The overalls, stupid!

728
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:51,040
I need to see myself.
Where's the tall guy? Please...?

729
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,320
Michel!

730
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,480
He's driving me crazy.

731
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:58,817
Oh Michel!

732
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:00,280
Michel!

733
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:02,455
Michel!

734
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,800
- Yes, I'm coming.
- Come on, move, right now...

735
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,240
Size XL on Monday, right?

736
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:08,880
- Yes, on Monday.
- What time on Monday?

737
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:10,600
- Come on Michel...
- I'll be right there!

738
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,160
On Monday, anytime.

739
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:14,200
- 4 pm?
- 4 pm's fine.

740
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,880
An hour to try some overalls...

741
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:20,765
Relax. I'm here.

742
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:24,120
- Which ones did you take?
- None!

743
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,159
- None?
- You pressured me!

744
01:17:02,475 --> 01:17:04,835
Am I a pain in the ass?

745
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:08,240
- I have to leave her, right?
- Fuck Michel!

746
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,760
You're a fool!

747
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:12,680
Charlotte's perfect!

748
01:17:13,185 --> 01:17:16,224
Now you've found a girl that can
put up with you for more than a month...

749
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:18,083
You're incredible!

750
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,320
Go for it!

751
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:23,840
Take care of the
fuckin' mouse and that's it.

752
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:25,931
Call a professional...

753
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:27,695
or buy a cat!

754
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:29,219
Are you listening to me at all?

755
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,880
There's always going to be
something more, always.

756
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,360
Find a nice man
if girls are too much for you.

757
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,680
What?

758
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,600
Where did that come from?

759
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,080
Is that an offer?

760
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:50,800
Come on! Very helpful!

761
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,160
Thanks for the tip!

762
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:55,760
Wait, wait...

763
01:17:56,931 --> 01:17:58,640
- You know what's funny?
- No?

764
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,640
We sometimes talk about it with Ines.

765
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:04,240
She wouldn't be surprised if you were a bit...

766
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,840
What the fuck!

767
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:20,800
Where did that come from?
That's bullshit.

768
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,120
Why are you saying that?

769
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,240
You should see your face.

770
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:29,480
Think about it, we never
saw you settled with a girl.

771
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:32,200
Maybe I have expectations.
Maybe I'm an idealist.

772
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:34,240
Expectations?

773
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,120
You're just a fag!

774
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,960
Sorry but if I was a fag,
it would show

775
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:40,640
and I'd know.

776
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:44,793
When I look at Ines, I think
you should review your expectations.

777
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:55,280
All good?

778
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:57,495
Yes...

779
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:59,560
Come here, I'll do your hair.

780
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,040
I was thinking...

781
01:19:07,192 --> 01:19:09,415
There's a guy at work,
people say he's a queer...

782
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,000
Really? Which one?

783
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,680
A new guy, you don't know him.

784
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:17,840
Thierry says he's queer because
he never stays long with the same girl.

785
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,960
Silly, isn't it!
That's not queer!

786
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,640
- I dunno...
- No, that's' not queer! Right?

787
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,880
I'm not sure.
Is he a bit of a sissy?

788
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,800
Oh no... Fuck no!

789
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:31,400
Not at all!

790
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:33,080
He's no sissy!

791
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,160
- And... Has he got a girlfriend?
- Yes, he has.

792
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,040
Of course!
It's silly really.

793
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:41,480
Thierry always thinks too much.
He's a pain in the ass.

794
01:19:41,505 --> 01:19:44,545
You know, it doesn't prove anything.

795
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:48,160
He's 30-something,
he would know by now.

796
01:19:48,185 --> 01:19:49,775
Not necessarily,

797
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:52,480
I had a friend at school.
He found out quite late.

798
01:19:52,947 --> 01:19:54,732
It was a hairstyling school, Charlotte.

799
01:19:54,757 --> 01:19:58,117
Anyway, everything became
very simple for him after that.

800
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,360
Feels good?

801
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,040
Oh, Michel, oh!

802
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:17,200
What's wrong with you?
Are you high or what?

803
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:21,320
What's bothering you?

804
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:24,400
The mouse thing?

805
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:32,360
I can take care of it, you know.

806
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:43,200
I've sorted out your books, right here.

807
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,800
I've put some of mine

808
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:46,680
From my book shelf.

809
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,400
It's our book shelf now.

810
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:53,040
I didn't know you had that one.
It used to be my favourite book for a long time.

811
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:57,480
It really needs dusting.
You haven't cleaned for ages.

812
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,600
It's a bit disgusting.

813
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,480
I've been thinking... I love that shelf.

814
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,920
We could put it back on the wall.

815
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:07,520
Where it used to be, right?

816
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:10,480
You'll figure out the height.
We'll hang it back.

817
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:13,215
So we can put this new plant
we bought at the market.

818
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:14,455
It's cute!

819
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:15,760
It will be fine here.

820
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,655
I'll find some place
for my little Buddha.

821
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:19,080
It's gorgeous, right?

822
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,840
And those curtains...

823
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,720
You need to sort these CD's and books.

824
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,760
I told myself: they're the same colour.

825
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:29,400
You also need to sort out the papers.

826
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:32,120
The Buddha: you like it or not?

827
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,960
There's a bill here...

828
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:37,400
When people come in,
they see Buddha's cute face...

829
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,120
I'm forgetting something.

830
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,480
Michel, you'll clean the mess, right?

831
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:42,822
Michel?

832
01:21:42,847 --> 01:21:44,207
We take it easy...

833
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,160
What about your action figures?

834
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,575
Michel?

835
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,200
Are you with me? Michel...

836
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,520
Answer me...

837
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,800
Listen, Michel, I need your help...

838
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:04,040
Michel, can't you see I'm losing it!

839
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,120
Michel?

840
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,640
Michel!

841
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:23,160
It's 5 pm and they're all damn gone.

842
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:26,720
And look at this mess!

843
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,680
It's always the same mess in the end.

844
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:34,640
Those guys don't respect the job anymore.

845
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,572
They can't blame us for
hiring Polish workers.

846
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:40,600
It can't be that difficult to work properly!

847
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,960
They understand nothing about bricklaying.

848
01:22:44,985 --> 01:22:46,852
Bricklaying is not about
putting a block on another.

849
01:22:46,877 --> 01:22:48,237
They know shit...

850
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,080
Bricklaying

851
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,200
is about creating something.

852
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,840
We are creating something here.

853
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,440
It's art, that's what I call it.

854
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,229
Look at that!

855
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,280
Not so hard to put water in the buckets

856
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,600
so that they can be clean in the morning.

857
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:08,560
Look, the buckets, a little water...

858
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:11,200
No need to be Einstein, right?

859
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,800
Caress me, Caress me...

860
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:29,000
Did you know I could
have been a pizza cook?

861
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,720
I swear...
My dad owned a pizza truck...

862
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,120
in Portissol.

863
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:34,680
The pizzas were splendid.

864
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,560
I reckon my dad was the first Arab
to cook pizza in France...

865
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,560
In Portissol for sure...

866
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:45,400
It feels good!

867
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,840
You know what,
my dad, he was a moron...

868
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,480
Somehow... He set the truck on fire.

869
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,640
<i>His shiny shoulders are quite hot...</i>

870
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,960
<i>What's wrong with me?
What am I talking about...?</i>

871
01:23:56,985 --> 01:23:58,015
No more costumers, no more money.

872
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:59,240
<i>He's funny.</i>

873
01:24:00,067 --> 01:24:01,427
<i>He's sweet.</i>

874
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:04,880
<i>I feel good around him.
It's simple. I feel warm.</i>

875
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:06,400
<i>He understands me.</i>

876
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:08,560
<i>Fuck! I am a fag!</i>

877
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:12,200
A guy opened a new pizza truck there.
A Sicilian!

878
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,480
<i>No! No way...</i>

879
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:16,040
<i>I'm gonna have to wear leather,
have manners,</i>

880
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:18,280
<i>change scene, listen to house music,
tell everyone.</i>

881
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,975
<i>They'll make fun of me.
I'll have no limits, no self-control.</i>

882
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
<i>My son will be ashamed of me.</i>

883
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:25,520
<i>There'll be no son.</i>

884
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:26,883
...his great-great-grandfather
was from Palermo.

885
01:24:26,908 --> 01:24:29,480
After 4 generations,
you're just French!

886
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:31,280
Look at me!
I'm Thierry not Mohamed.

887
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,320
You know, I used to like cooking.

888
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:36,440
Really.

889
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:39,240
Would you be up for opening
a business together?

890
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,720
We could open a restaurant

891
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:43,920
or a bar...

892
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,320
I dunno...

893
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,520
Provence cuisine?

894
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:51,440
<i>It's warm. It's smooth.</i>

895
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:53,680
We could make cocktails.

896
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:57,480
<i>Thanks for making me feel good...</i>

897
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,600
You decide...

898
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:08,720
Let's become partners.

899
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,960
<i>I am fucking hard!</i>

900
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:46,480
Oh Michel!

901
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,320
Come take a dip!

902
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,160
Charlotte?

903
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:56,880
What is it, Michel?

904
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,080
Can't you see, Charlotte?

905
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:01,600
See what?

906
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,600
Don't you see it?

907
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:05,040
See what?

908
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:06,960
I'm a fag, Charlotte!

909
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,520
Really?

910
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,880
Since when?

911
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:17,760
All along I guess...
It's been on my mind for a while.

912
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,640
- It has nothing to do with the mind!
- Yes, it has!

913
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:25,840
In senior year,
I dated Céline Colombier

914
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,640
because I was a fan of DiCaprio
and she looked like him.

915
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:30,960
Bullshit.

916
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:32,360
It's proof!

917
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:36,480
You're in love?
You wanna fuck a guy?

918
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,160
- Nope...
- There you go!

919
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,520
In fact my heart is queer
but my cock is straight.

920
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:42,280
Nonsense!

921
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,342
I'm opening up to you
and you're teasing me.

922
01:26:44,367 --> 01:26:45,615
That's wrong!

923
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:48,400
I know. But you lost it!
You think too much!

924
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:51,200
You're a fag when
you like sex with men.

925
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:53,640
The truth is you're terrified
because we moved in together.

926
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,920
- How do you know?
- I know you!

927
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:57,920
You know a real fag then!

928
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,080
Listen to me!
I'm thinking out loud!

929
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:02,920
Wait!

930
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,080
You don't understand me.

931
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:06,840
Listen to me!

932
01:27:07,673 --> 01:27:10,158
- We could talk at least.
- Talk about what?!

933
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,720
- I give you everything
- You're very demanding.

934
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:13,920
What?

935
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,080
Demanding!

936
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,240
Okay then, you don't want to talk.

937
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,360
You wanna be ashamed about it!
Be ashamed!

938
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:24,240
But I am proud!
I am proud!

939
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,440
Proud to be a fag!
And I'll learn how to like cock!

940
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:27,840
Good for you!

941
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:29,720
There are children!

942
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:30,775
Nice party...

943
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:31,895
Sorry?

944
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,280
I'm sorry, I don't speak French.

945
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:35,640
And you?

946
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:38,240
Do you speak English?

947
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,200
No really...

948
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:42,600
Little bit.

949
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,320
I know.

950
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:47,640
What's your name?

951
01:30:47,942 --> 01:30:49,015
Michel.

952
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:50,080
Michel...

953
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,238
Ma belle.

954
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,720
Do you have a lover?

955
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:00,560
Me, I'm "<i>maçon</i>".

956
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:02,160
Maçon...

957
01:31:04,970 --> 01:31:06,175
Maçon.

958
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:08,240
Yeah, muscle! Strong man!

959
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,000
And you're here to dance?

960
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:15,120
Or to meet some people?

961
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:16,880
It depends.

962
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:19,640
But you're gay, right?

963
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,400
It depends.

964
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:25,760
It depends?
It depends on what?

965
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,320
It depends on the day.

966
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:30,200
It depends on your mood?

967
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:33,000
Depends on the weather...

968
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:37,986
Sorry.

969
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:04,120
You're not gay.

970
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:12,320
Tell me. It's simple.

971
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:14,760
It's a gay club,
I'm gay...

972
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:16,880
It's for gays, here.

973
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,160
I know, I know.

974
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:21,473
So what?

975
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:23,640
I'm gay.

976
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,080
- You're gay?
- Yes.

977
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:28,080
Of course.

978
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,480
- Sure?
- Sure.

979
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,366
Michel?

980
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:30,000
Hey there!

981
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:32,440
Are you okay, honey?

982
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,360
You are a sleeping beauty, you know.

983
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,491
You slept very well.

984
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:40,640
You were really tired, right?

985
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:45,055
My head...

986
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:46,520
A cup of coffee, sweetie?

987
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:50,240
There are croissants.

988
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:51,920
Lay still, I'll do it.

989
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:53,840
I'm gonna make a nice cup of coffee.

990
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,920
Would you prefer
a cup of tea?

991
01:33:57,720 --> 01:33:58,840
No, just rest...

992
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:02,520
- What is that?
- This is...

993
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:04,960
Listen honey, Charlotte!

994
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:08,240
You should stay in bed,
you're exhausted...

995
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:17,960
Hi.

996
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:21,320
- "<i>Bonjour</i>"...
- It's a nightmare...

997
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:22,640
I am...

998
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:23,920
...Michel's friend.

999
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:26,400
I'm here for...

1000
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:27,880
- The week-end.
- Who the fuck is that?

1001
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:29,720
- A friend.
- A friend?

1002
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,520
- Are you kidding me? He was...
- Oh god, no, he wasn't...

1003
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:33,960
Come on then, tell me!

1004
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:36,440
- We were playing!
- Playing?

1005
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:38,360
You're really taking the piss out of me!

1006
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:39,575
Charlotte!

1007
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,055
Charlotte... Charlotte, listen,

1008
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:43,040
I swear, I didn't like it at all.

1009
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:45,080
Why are you doing this to me?

1010
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:46,880
It's not because of you...

1011
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,120
You're overreacting...

1012
01:34:48,145 --> 01:34:49,390
Let go of me!

1013
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:51,600
You didn't think I'd come back...

1014
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:53,680
- You're that stupid...
- Excuse me, she took my...

1015
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,400
You are still here!
Get the fuck out!

1016
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:57,240
- She took my jeans!
- Look what you've done!

1017
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:58,880
Don't take it out on him.

1018
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:02,240
- He didn't rape you, did he?
- No but I didn't really want it...

1019
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:04,040
Let go of me!

1020
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,280
- Calm down!
- In our bed?

1021
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,440
- You make me sick!
- I was going to change the sheets...

1022
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:14,690
My jeans!

1023
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:17,040
Charlotte, wait!!

1024
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:18,720
Oh for fuck sake!

1025
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:21,480
Charlotte, stay! Please, stay!

1026
01:35:22,044 --> 01:35:23,120
My jeans!

1027
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:25,240
Please, help me to
put outside!

1028
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:28,520
- You're serious?
- Yes, I'm serious, please!

1029
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:29,680
You're fucking crazy!

1030
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:31,800
You're a man!
You broke my love!

1031
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:33,880
Because of you!
Please do it!

1032
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,320
Do you realize the situation!

1033
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:38,009
You fucking egoist!

1034
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:39,400
I'm naked!

1035
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:42,275
Hey wait!

1036
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:44,409
My jeans!

1037
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:47,360
Fuck...

1038
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,280
Fuck!

1039
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,240
Charlotte!

1040
01:36:54,598 --> 01:37:02,598
