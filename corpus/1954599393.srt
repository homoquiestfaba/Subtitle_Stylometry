1
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:32,282
- There's the mountain.
- I never thought we'd make it.

2
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:36,411
These ruins gotta be close. Let's go!

3
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:42,042
This is it! Come on, let's get started.

4
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:55,764
My God, that's it. We found it!

5
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:06,775
The lost horse of the first Tang emperor,
buried in the 7th century.

6
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:10,571
- The discovery of a lifetime.
- It's worth a fortune!

7
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:21,164
- Is the horse stowed safely below?
- Don't worry, I sent it ahead to my wife.

8
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:24,710
Your wife?
I thought we agreed to take it with us.

9
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:30,632
It's safer this way. Let's ship out
before the storm gets worse.

10
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,427
Son of a...!

11
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,877
Next item, lot number 123,

12
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,255
a guardian horse
from the ancient Tang dynasty.

13
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:14,384
One of a pair,
it's the only known existing statue.

14
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:18,847
Another was rumoured
to have been found but never surfaced.

15
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:22,142
We'll start the bidding with $20 million.

16
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:28,148
$20 million! To think there
might be another one out there!

17
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:31,527
I wonder where it could be?

18
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:37,366
What sort of person would have it?
I wonder what their story is?

19
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:41,078
<i>Here's the story of a lovely lady</i>

20
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,915
<i>Who was bringing up</i>
<i>three very lovely girls</i>

21
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:49,503
<i>All of them had hair of gold</i>
<i>like their mother</i>

22
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,714
<i>The youngest one in curls</i>

23
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:56,343
<i>It's the story of a man named Brady</i>

24
00:02:56,552 --> 00:03:00,180
<i>Who was busy</i>
<i>with three boys of his own</i>

25
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:03,809
<i>They were four men living all together</i>

26
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,145
<i>Yet they were all alone</i>

27
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,899
<i>Till the one day</i>
<i>when the lady met this fellow</i>

28
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:14,653
<i>And they knew</i>
<i>that it was much more than a hunch</i>

29
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:18,448
<i>That this group</i>
<i>must somehow form a family</i>

30
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:21,577
<i>That's the way</i>
<i>we all became the Brady Bunch</i>

31
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,996
<i>The Brady Bunch</i>

32
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,123
<i>The Brady Bunch</i>

33
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:30,919
<i>That's the way</i>
<i>we became the Brady Bunch</i>

34
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:43,891
I love the last day of school.
So many boys wrote in my yearbook.

35
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,311
Lucky I ordered one with extra pages.

36
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,441
- That's nice, Marcia.
- Clark Tyson even wrote in French.

37
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:58,197
"Ménage à trois."
I bet that means "You're the most".

38
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:03,535
- Did any boys write in your yearbook?
- Sure, lots of boys did.

39
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,704
Let's see.

40
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:11,543
- But, Jan, I don't see any messages.
- Oh, well... Here's one.

41
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:18,842
"Two, four, six, eight, wear your
retainer and your teeth will get straight."

42
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:23,680
You're not supposed to have
your orthodontist on your yearbook!

43
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:27,267
Here's one from my optometrist!

44
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:34,983
You're saying there's a wire you
plug into your TV to get 50 channels?

45
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:40,822
Sorry, but you have to get up
pretty early to fool Mike Brady!

46
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,283
Cable!

47
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:54,211
- How's that drawing coming, champ?
- Not so good, Mom.

48
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:59,216
Why do I have to work in Dad's
architecture firm this summer?

49
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:03,178
Tommy's dad's a fireman,
so he hangs out at the station.

50
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:08,809
And Eddie's dad's a boxer, so
he mops up all the blood and the sweat.

51
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:13,230
Who do you think designed
that firehouse and that gym?

52
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:17,317
- You mean...
- An architect, just like your father.

53
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:21,363
As an architect, you could design
a building where they build...

54
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:26,285
- ...rockets that fly to the moon.
- The moon? Wow!

55
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,037
What if I'm not good enough?

56
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:33,959
I drew a picture of our house
and it turned out lousy.

57
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,503
It's not bad for a first try.

58
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:40,799
If you keep practising,
you'll be as good as your father.

59
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:44,011
Thanks, Mom. I will.

60
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:56,190
- Looks delicious, Alice.
- Mr Brady!

61
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,526
So, we're all set
for the party on Saturday.

62
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:03,614
I've rented the tables
and I've ordered the meat from Sam.

63
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:07,910
Sam is so thoughtful.
He promised me his special tube steak.

64
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,120
That's great, Alice.

65
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:14,374
This will be Mrs Brady's best
anniversary present ever.

66
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:20,088
I thought a wedding ceremony to renew
our vows would be the perfect surprise.

67
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,508
Quiet! Here comes you-know-who.

68
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,969
Make sure she doesn't suspect
you-know-what.

69
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:30,682
Make sure which you-know-who
doesn't suspect what?

70
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,686
Nothing! Just what you-know-who
is doing for you-know-whom...

71
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,730
...on their you-know-what.

72
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:41,818
Mike? You weren't talking about
my anniversary gift, were you?

73
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:45,531
Anniversary gift!

74
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,533
You're silly!

75
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:52,371
Hey, everybody! Peter just gave me
his old detective kit.

76
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,707
Kitty Karry-All and I are his assistants.

77
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:59,169
Is there anything
you'd like me to find, Alice?

78
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:05,592
How about my girlish figure?
I haven't seen that in about 20 years.

79
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,469
- Oh, Alice!
- Oh, Alice!

80
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:12,140
- Let's look for some fingerprints, Cindy.
- OK.

81
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:18,564
I know where they could find
my fingerprints, Mr Brady.

82
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,527
Hey! Watch out!

83
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,196
Kids! What do they know about life?

84
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:31,368
- New outfit?
- My funky new threads.

85
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:35,497
As a man, you have to have it goin' on
in a far-out kinda way.

86
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,791
- When you're a man?
- Yeah.

87
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,505
I'm going to see if there's something
heavy happenin'. Bye, Mike.

88
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,465
Mike?

89
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:48,677
Halt! Reverse march, Private Brady.

90
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,850
Greg, it's...

91
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,606
It may be the fad to call parents
by their first names,

92
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:05,152
- but I'd still like to be known as "Dad".
- Sorry, Dad.

93
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,407
I'll be a senior next year
and we need to make some changes.

94
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,827
In fact, I'd like to talk to you
about something.

95
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:19,875
- What are you doing?
- I'm moving into the attic.

96
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,128
You're what?
Who said you could do that?

97
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:27,341
- Dad.
- But I need my own room, too!

98
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:32,971
Get hip, Marcia. I'm a man now,
so I get to have my own pad.

99
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,390
Get with the times, Greg!

100
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,562
There's a new thing called women's lib.
It means women get what they want.

101
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:45,526
- I'm not backing down.
- Neither am I.

102
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:52,783
OK, then. I guess
there's only one way to settle this.

103
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,381
OK. Your turn.

104
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,675
No problem.

105
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:20,352
Careful, Marcia. Your bracelet!

106
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:31,697
- Good job, Marcia!
- Watch out!

107
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,365
Oh, my nose!

108
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:40,497
Oh, no! The horse. It's ruined!

109
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:44,459
Jan! What are you doing?

110
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:48,589
Hey! Let's bring it down
to a dull roar, here.

111
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,049
What happened here?

112
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,678
Oh, kids! You know
how grape juice stains.

113
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:58,182
I'm donating this to my
women's club charity auction.

114
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:04,521
- Alice, could you take it to be cleaned?
- Sure, Mrs Brady.

115
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,982
Side saddle or bareback?

116
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:11,236
Hold it, kids!
You all have some explaining to do.

117
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,572
- It's really...
- Jan...

118
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,490
...the attic, so...
...downstairs...

119
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,327
One at a time!

120
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,663
I'll go first, because I'm the prettiest.

121
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:25,083
We built the house of cards
to decide who gets the attic.

122
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:29,880
It isn't fair that Greg gets the attic
just because he's a boy.

123
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:34,718
It's not fair to give it to Marcia
just because she's a girl.

124
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:37,888
Quiet... Quiet!

125
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:43,101
We have to stick together or we'll
fall apart, like that house of cards.

126
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,854
A deck consists of 52 cards.

127
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:49,733
If the hearts didn't work with
the diamonds, spades with clubs,

128
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:52,361
then how could we play gin rummy?

129
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,531
So, in keeping with
the spirit of togetherness,

130
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:58,325
I'm sure you know the right thing to do.

131
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:09,002
- Maybe you'd better tell them.
- Why, share the attic, of course.

132
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:12,548
- Share the attic!
- You've gotta be kidding!

133
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:17,553
Sharing and togetherness
is what this family is all about.

134
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:20,639
I'll get it.

135
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:24,643
Remember, we're the Bradys.

136
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:28,981
And there's nothing in this world
that can split us apart.

137
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:33,318
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Carol Brady.

138
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:36,613
My name's Roy Martin. I'm her husband.

139
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,507
- Honey, are you all right?
- Honey, are you all right?

140
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,759
I'm all right.

141
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:03,098
Kids, take a seat and give
your mother a little breathing room.

142
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:05,142
Right over here.

143
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,686
Roy?

144
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:12,024
You were lost at sea so many
years ago, I thought you were...

145
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:16,945
Dead, stiff, rotting? Gone to
that archaeological dig in the sky?

146
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:21,867
I almost was. But the thought
of my family back home,

147
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,328
that's what kept me going.

148
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:30,000
My three girls.
All of them with hair of gold.

149
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,669
Like their mother.

150
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:35,422
Marcia...

151
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:37,799
...Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!

152
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:42,971
You have grown up to be so gorgeous!

153
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,307
I know.

154
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:49,353
And Jan, my dear Jan...

155
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,815
Isn't Marcia gorgeous?

156
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,735
And the littlest.

157
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:59,112
Sandy!

158
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,114
Cindy.

159
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:03,450
Thindy?

160
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:05,953
Daddy's sorry, Daddy had amnesia.

161
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:09,581
But don't be upset,
because... Daddy's back!

162
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:15,128
Hate to rain on your parade,
but Daddy's already here.

163
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:18,674
I'm Mike Brady
and Carol and I are married.

164
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:22,135
Of course. I'm sorry, Mark.

165
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:28,016
I couldn't expect a woman as beautiful
as Carol to remain single very long.

166
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:32,437
Oh, Carol...
You haven't changed a bit.

167
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:35,440
Hey, same pantsuit, too!

168
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:39,987
But... Roy, I hardly recognise you.

169
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:42,906
You look so...

170
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,742
...not like you.

171
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:50,998
I know, Carol, I do look different.
Ever since... the accident.

172
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,749
Accident?

173
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,336
An elephant stepped on my face
in Kuala Lumpur.

174
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:59,047
- Wow!
- An elephant? Wow!

175
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:06,221
The surgeons did all they could, but...
Gosh, you must find me hideous.

176
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,933
Hideous? No.

177
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:14,396
But you look taller than I remember
and your voice sounds different.

178
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:16,857
Really? Is that true, Roy?

179
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:22,196
I was put on the rack in Singapore,
that stretched me about half a foot.

180
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:26,408
But it was a small price to pay
to save a colony of nuns.

181
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:30,162
And a man's voice changes, Carol,

182
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:37,002
if that man feels the sorrow of being
away from the ones he loves too long.

183
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:44,968
Oh, Roy! It really is you.

184
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,767
I heard the bell. Do we have company?

185
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:57,731
This is Roy, Mrs Brady's first husband.
He's not dead, as we originally thought.

186
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,943
Nice to meet you...

187
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:03,278
He's a hunk, huh?

188
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:08,575
I mean, a hunk of meatloaf...
meatloaf sandwiches in the kitchen...

189
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:14,581
I rushed back as soon as I came out
of the coma in that Siberian hospital.

190
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,252
You've hardly eaten a thing.
Don't you like meatloaf?

191
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,045
It's delicious.

192
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:26,051
You don't mind if I ask you
what your plans are, now you're alive?

193
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,721
To be honest, all that's on my mind...

194
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,433
...is getting in touch with
the things I left behind.

195
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,644
Oh, I see.

196
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:40,107
I don't want to impose on you
any more tonight,

197
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,610
so I'll find a fleabag motel to stay in...

198
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:46,196
Can't Mr Martin stay with us?

199
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:49,950
It'd be great to have a real
adventurer in the house.

200
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,077
Mike?

201
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,582
Kids, remember what I said
earlier about togetherness?

202
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,962
A family is only as strong as
the glue that holds that family together.

203
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:04,631
As an architect,
I've learned that...

204
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,677
...a house isn't just fake panelling,
shag carpeting and Formica.

205
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:12,890
And as long as the glue that
holds that house together is strong...

206
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,601
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt, but...

207
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:19,980
Doin' a fly-by here.
I'm having trouble following you.

208
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:23,025
Really? Well, what I'm saying is,

209
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:26,945
there's always room
for one more in the Brady house.

210
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,781
I insist that you stay
here as our guest.

211
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,702
You can take my den
as long as you need it.

212
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:36,163
You want me to stay?

213
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:39,500
I can't tell you
how much that means to me.

214
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:43,462
- Thank you, Mark.
- Mike.

215
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:49,468
Here we go.

216
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,596
Jan, why don't you wear
your glasses any more?

217
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,432
Glasses made me look positively goofy.

218
00:16:55,641 --> 00:17:00,020
But these new contact lenses
help me to look ultra-glamorous.

219
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:01,688
Who has the toothpaste?

220
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:04,858
I wanna get up early
and hang out with Mr Martin.

221
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:08,445
- He's really groovy.
- And he's my dad.

222
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:12,824
You're so lucky, Jan.
Well, except for your eyesight.

223
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:16,411
And your teeth. And your freckles.

224
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:21,166
And that towel hanging from your braces.

225
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,335
Where are you going?

226
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:29,466
Downstairs, to talk to the only person
in this house who might understand me.

227
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:34,721
I'm in!

228
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,015
They bought everything...

229
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:43,105
...including the largest collection
of kitsch 70s memorabilia I've ever seen.

230
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:46,275
Anyway, I haven't found the horse yet.

231
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:49,194
No, I am not going to ask where it is!

232
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:54,074
We're talking $20 million.
I don't want to tip anybody off.

233
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:58,078
Call the buyer and make sure
he's agreed to our price.

234
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:00,497
I'll take care of my part.

235
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:03,167
- I gotta go.
- Daddy?

236
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,253
He's upstairs. I mean...

237
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:10,716
...what is it... pumpkin?

238
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:14,803
I need to talk to you about
something super-important.

239
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:17,764
I don't know
who else I can ask.

240
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:21,727
Well, all right. Shoot.

241
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,980
- Can I sit on your lap?
- What?

242
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:28,066
I mean... Why not?

243
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:33,655
You sure did grow
since Daddy's been away.

244
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:38,285
Now, what's on your mind?

245
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:41,830
- It's about... boys.
- Oh, God.

246
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:46,752
I don't think Daddy is up
to talking to you about that.

247
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,588
You could ask your brothers or sisters.

248
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:55,302
They just laugh at me. I want to know,
how do I get a boyfriend?

249
00:18:55,511 --> 00:19:01,266
Well, sweetheart, the only way
you're gonna get a boyfriend...

250
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:03,310
...is to make one up.

251
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:09,608
Make one up. Of course!
I'll make up an imaginary boyfriend,

252
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:14,571
and Marcia - and everyone else -
will see how popular I am.

253
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,491
Oh, thanks Daddy!

254
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,839
I'm glad Mom and Dad
didn't invite Roy to stay up here.

255
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:33,757
It's crowded enough.

256
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:40,722
I'm not any happier about this than you.
We just have to make the best of it.

257
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:47,271
I can't believe I have to share
my far-out pad with my sister.

258
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,378
One,

259
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:13,088
two,

260
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:14,923
three,

261
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:17,050
four...

262
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:19,052
...four...

263
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:21,972
...four...

264
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:24,892
...four...

265
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,562
- Marcia?
- Yes, Greg.

266
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,900
I mean... What?

267
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:38,405
I was just wondering,
if Roy is really Mom's husband...

268
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:43,118
- Does that mean...
- We're not brother and sister?

269
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,750
Good book?

270
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,461
What's it about?

271
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:58,175
Why don't you put down your needlepoint
and I'll act it out for you?

272
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:00,427
Oh, Mike!

273
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:12,731
Honey, did you just have
the same dream I had?

274
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:18,195
I'm afraid so. Now Roy's shown up,
everything's so confusing.

275
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:21,448
Our family's been through
tough times before.

276
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:26,662
Remember when the kids couldn't agree
what to buy with the trading stamps?

277
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,958
- A sewing machine or a row boat?
- I remember.

278
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:35,045
In the end, we got a new TV,
something we could all enjoy.

279
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:38,173
I'm sure this will work out just like that.

280
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:43,595
- We'll get a new TV?
- No, we don't really need one.

281
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:46,807
I love you, Mike.

282
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:52,020
But I married Roy first and I promised
to love, honour and obey him.

283
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:54,857
A Brady always keeps a promise.

284
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,442
Oh, Mike. What are we gonna do?

285
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:00,404
It seems complicated,

286
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:04,491
but I'll soon get a firm grasp
on the situation.

287
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:10,080
There's something I'd like to
get a firm grasp on, Mr Brady.

288
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:18,088
<i>My name is Roy Martin.</i>
<i>I'm her husband.</i>

289
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:28,682
- Here you go, Peter.
- Thanks, Alice.

290
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:34,062
Can Kitty Karry-All and I help you bake
Mom and Dad's special wedding cake?

291
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:38,775
Cindy, when are you going to learn
that your doll is not a real person?

292
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:44,198
It's time you grew up and played
with important things like hair clips.

293
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:47,367
I'm gonna need all the help I can get.

294
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:52,664
I'm gonna make a three-tiered cake
and on top a bride and groo...

295
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:56,627
...Groovy day, isn't it, Mrs Brady?
Coffee?

296
00:22:56,835 --> 00:23:01,131
- Thanks, Alice. Hi, kids.
- Morning!

297
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,842
Will Mr Martin join us for breakfast?

298
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:07,012
I tried to wake him
and he told me to stuff it.

299
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:10,224
He must think we're having turkey.

300
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:12,559
Jan, why aren't you eating?

301
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:17,606
Are the blueberries stuck
in your braces again? Let me help.

302
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:22,027
That's not it. I'm watching my figure
for my new boyfriend.

303
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:25,948
- New boyfriend? Well, that's news.
- I'll say!

304
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:30,285
- What's his name?
- His name... is George.

305
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:34,414
- George what?
- George...

306
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:36,542
...Tropicana.

307
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,587
What a nice name! Is he Cuban?

308
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,259
No, I mean Glass. George Glass.

309
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:49,012
That's funny. I've never heard
of a George Glass at our school.

310
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:53,058
He's a transfer student.
He came in the last week of school.

311
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:57,437
He's really good-looking
and he thinks I'm super-cool.

312
00:23:57,646 --> 00:24:00,482
Sure, Jan.

313
00:24:00,691 --> 00:24:03,652
- Marcia, I'll drive us to the rec centre.
- Great.

314
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:07,322
Remember, you two. No fooling around.

315
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:16,081
If you have to be at the rec centre soon,
there's no time to dilly-dally.

316
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:19,793
Have fun!

317
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:23,088
- Yeah.
- Hey, Mr Martin.

318
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:27,593
Can you show me some things
from your expeditions?

319
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:30,262
- What are these?
- Nunchucks.

320
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,765
Martial arts weapon. Stand back.

321
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:49,489
- Neat-o!
- You like 'em?

322
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:52,117
- Knock yourself out.
- Thanks.

323
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:56,079
- There you are, Peter.
- Look what Mr Martin gave me.

324
00:24:56,288 --> 00:25:00,083
- Could I stay home today?
- With Mr Martin?

325
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:03,003
But this is your first day at the office.

326
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:06,798
I'd like a little quiet time here
all on my own.

327
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:09,384
Well, all right.

328
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:14,056
Hurry up, you don't want to be tardy
your first day on the job.

329
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:17,768
- Thanks for the neat stuff, Mr Martin.
- No problem.

330
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:21,104
You seem to be having
quite an effect on Peter.

331
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:26,193
Like I always say, "<i>Veni, vidi, vici</i>".
I came, I saw, I conquered.

332
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:30,030
Like I always say, "Caveat emptor".

333
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:33,909
Doesn't that mean, "Buyer beware"?

334
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:36,829
Yes. Yes, it does.

335
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:03,355
OK. Two cokes for two groovy chicks.

336
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:06,942
Either of you want a hot wiener
to go with that?

337
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,194
No...

338
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:12,322
Thanks for the tip!

339
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:15,868
Hello. This is George Glass.

340
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:19,830
Would you please page
the very beautiful Jan Brady...

341
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:24,251
...and tell her to call her boyfriend,
George Glass?

342
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:27,462
You will? Thank you.

343
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:36,763
- Hi, Marcia. Working on your tan?
- M-hm.

344
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:39,016
- <i>Attention...</i>
- Listen, Marcia!

345
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:43,187
- What?
- <i>Will the very beautiful Jan Brady...</i>

346
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:51,195
Go away!

347
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:56,158
Did you hear?
George Glass was trying to page me.

348
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:58,577
Honestly, Jan!

349
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:02,539
I'm going for a dip.

350
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:07,461
Kids, listen to me.

351
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:10,756
You behave. I'll be right over here.

352
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:13,425
Mrs Cummings! Hi!

353
00:27:13,634 --> 00:27:16,970
Jan! How are you doing?
How's your summer going?

354
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:20,516
It's fine, except...

355
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:23,685
What is it, Jan? You can tell me.

356
00:27:23,894 --> 00:27:27,439
School's out, but I'm still
your guidance counsellor.

357
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:32,152
I've been telling people something
that isn't the total truth.

358
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:37,449
- I wanna know if that's OK.
- You have to be true to yourself, Jan.

359
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:41,537
If other people don't like it,
it can be a real drag.

360
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:47,417
But I say, if it makes you feel better
to have a little mystery about yourself,

361
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:49,795
then you go, girl!

362
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:54,216
Gee, thanks!
That makes me feel a whole lot better.

363
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:58,554
Momma, she's teasing me again!

364
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:01,890
I've told you not to fight with your sister!

365
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:05,894
But she started it,
only she never gets yelled at.

366
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:10,274
Everybody loves Moesha.
Moesha, Moesha, Moesha!

367
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:17,948
Hey, Brent! Hey, Jason!
Any safety infractions today?

368
00:28:18,157 --> 00:28:23,912
- Look, Jay, it's Snackboy.
- Run and get me a Fresca, Brady.

369
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:29,459
- You guys are nutty.
- Jay! Look, coming up the ladder.

370
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:31,545
Good sighting, dude.

371
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:42,764
OK, fellas.

372
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:46,894
Time to see the master at work.

373
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:50,647
That boy's out there.

374
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:54,109
Parents must have done
serious drugs in the 70s.

375
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,001
Hey, there, foxy lady.

376
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:14,004
- Marcia!
- Greg!

377
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,594
- I gotta go.
- Me, too.

378
00:29:28,352 --> 00:29:32,731
And this is where we display our models.
Look, this one's mine.

379
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,318
Everything's miniaturised,
trees, car, people,

380
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:39,321
potato-sack racing in the back yard.

381
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:43,659
- Peter?
- Neat, Dad.

382
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:46,411
Let me show you my office.

383
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,705
Mike, where's that boy of yours?

384
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:54,336
Peter, you remember my boss,
Mr Phillips.

385
00:29:54,545 --> 00:29:56,797
Nice to see you again, Mr Phillips.

386
00:29:58,674 --> 00:30:01,301
- Hospital.
- Hospital?

387
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:07,182
I'm almost done with those hospital
blueprints. You can have them by five.

388
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:11,854
Dad, I think I hit him on the head
with these. I'm sorry.

389
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:15,774
- Drumsticks are not toys.
- Not drumsticks, weapons.

390
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:18,151
Weapons are not toys, either.

391
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:23,740
- I'm going to have to confiscate these.
- But they were a gift.

392
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:27,911
A gift is a good thing when the giver
gives thought to the gift.

393
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:33,375
When the gift the giver gives gives grief,
that gift should give the givee regrets.

394
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:39,173
Now, let's get working on
those hospital plans for Mr Phillips.

395
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:48,348
...149, 150, 151.

396
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:52,853
Gosh! I never knew I had
this many hairs on the back of my hand.

397
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:56,565
Bobby! Bobby!
Something terrible has happened.

398
00:30:56,773 --> 00:31:00,110
- What is it?
- Kitty Karry-All is missing.

399
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,114
- Really? This is super!
- What do you mean, super?

400
00:31:04,323 --> 00:31:08,785
This is our first real case.
Wherever that doll is, we'll find her.

401
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:12,789
You look under that bed, I'll get this one.

402
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:25,886
- She's not under here...
- Not here, either. Hi, Mr Martin.

403
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:29,932
You kids scared the sh...
...the heck out of me.

404
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,060
We're looking for Kitty Karry-All
with Bobby's detective kit.

405
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:37,481
- I'm a private dick.
- Nah, too easy.

406
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:42,694
Look, here's 20 bucks.
Go buy a magic kit and disappear.

407
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:45,948
- Gee, thanks!
- Wait! On second thoughts...

408
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:49,701
...maybe you can help.
I'm looking for a horse.

409
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:55,374
A horth? In the houthe? Mommy
wouldn't allow a horth in the houthe.

410
00:31:57,042 --> 00:32:00,921
It's cute. Very cute...
No, it's a sculpture of a horse.

411
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:07,553
- You mean the one we messed up?
- What do you mean, you messed up?

412
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:11,723
- There was an accident.
- An accident? Where's the horse?

413
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:18,063
Well, we sent it to the antiques store
on Sherwood Avenue to be cleaned.

414
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:22,442
Oh, Sherwood Avenue?
All right. Thanks, Jan. Thanks, Peter.

415
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:28,407
Here's another 20 bucks.
Get yourselves to The Gap, fast.

416
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:39,793
- Oh, can I borrow your car, Bobby?
- I'm Greg.

417
00:32:40,002 --> 00:32:42,546
- Whatever.
- Where do you need to go?

418
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:47,593
- To get something for your mother.
- We need to get mom a present, too.

419
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:50,179
We'll go to the shopping centre.

420
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:52,472
- Did you get it?
- No problem.

421
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:55,809
Here it is.
Clean as new and just as heavy.

422
00:32:56,018 --> 00:33:01,356
I haven't had 30Ibs of horse
since Sam had a health inspection.

423
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:02,983
Oh, Alice!

424
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:09,573
- And Greg's a really great driver.
- Yeah, this'll be great.

425
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:13,368
- See you later, Alice.
- Have a nice neigh!

426
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:17,706
- Bye, Alice.
- No, wait!

427
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:09,049
Where's Roy?

428
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:12,803
Hey! Over here! Taxi!

429
00:35:07,858 --> 00:35:10,068
Whoops!

430
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:25,417
I'm on to you, Mr Roy Martin.

431
00:35:26,502 --> 00:35:31,548
He likes exotic foods.
No wonder he didn't want my meatloaf.

432
00:35:31,757 --> 00:35:36,553
Maybe if I put these in his supper,
his appetite will come back.

433
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:57,491
After 15 years at the same salon,
my hairstylist went out of business.

434
00:35:57,699 --> 00:36:01,870
I can believe it.
You relax, Sergio is here for you.

435
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,208
I'll give you a whole new look.
Everything's going to be different.

436
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:10,546
But I don't want everything different.
I love Mike.

437
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:15,843
- Who's Mike?
- I'm sorry. Mike's my husband.

438
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:18,929
At least, he's one of my husbands.

439
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:22,850
Interesting! Keep going, get it out.

440
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:27,104
It looks like I'm still married to Roy,
my first husband.

441
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:31,275
What kind of person would I be
if I forgot my vows?

442
00:36:31,483 --> 00:36:32,609
Normal.

443
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:36,822
What should I do if Roy asks
the girls and me to go away with him?

444
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:41,451
What about Mike? And Bobby?
And Peter? And Greg?

445
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:46,707
- Good God! Three more husbands?
- No, just one too many.

446
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:52,004
- There's a simple solution. Get divorced.
- Oh, I couldn't!

447
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:57,092
With your new hairstyle, you'll do lots
of things you never thought you could.

448
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:01,722
Buckle up, Carol. It's magic time.

449
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:12,649
- Comb.
- Comb.

450
00:37:13,317 --> 00:37:15,694
- Scissors.
- Scissors.

451
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:21,366
- Chainsaw.
- Chainsaw.

452
00:37:43,722 --> 00:37:47,142
Sergio? Sergi...

453
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:49,144
Where's that bald girl?

454
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:53,899
Well, Mrs Brady.
What do you think of the new you?

455
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:59,196
I like it!

456
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:08,831
Still planning for the wedding ceremony?

457
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:12,376
That's right. I thought the organ
would go over there.

458
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:18,507
If things don't straighten out, Mrs Brady
may never see that organ again.

459
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:25,639
Hey, Dad!
Boy, did we have a far-out time!

460
00:38:25,848 --> 00:38:32,229
I found a groovy present for Mom. A
barrette for me to wear to the wedding.

461
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:36,608
- I have something I'd like to discuss.
- Is it about where I shop?

462
00:38:36,817 --> 00:38:40,654
Now you mention it,
I have that suit in brown and green.

463
00:38:40,863 --> 00:38:45,200
- I know. You're wearing it.
- So I am.

464
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:48,787
It's about Peter
and the gift you gave him.

465
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:50,581
The nunchucks.

466
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:54,376
Shall I tell you
what being a good guest means?

467
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:58,463
- Could I stop you?
- It means respecting the house rules.

468
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:03,302
The rules in our house read,
"Do not give lethal weapons to children."

469
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,888
What you give to children
comes back to you.

470
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:09,725
Kids are like little people, only younger.
Understood?

471
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:14,062
Absolutely! It'll never happen again.
Thanks, Mark.

472
00:39:14,271 --> 00:39:16,064
- Mike.
- Roy.

473
00:39:16,273 --> 00:39:18,567
- Right.
- Yeah.

474
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:25,365
- Roy!
- Carol!

475
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:29,786
I've never been so happy
to see anybody in my life.

476
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:35,375
- There's something I want to ask you.
- I want to ask you something, too.

477
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,088
How do you feel about divor... div... di...

478
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:44,885
Oh, Carol, you're stuttering.
But it only makes you more charming.

479
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:47,638
You shouldn't flatter me.

480
00:39:47,846 --> 00:39:52,476
A long time ago I sent you something,
that horse from my last journey.

481
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:57,856
It has no real value but it's a symbol
of our relationship. I need to see it.

482
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:02,653
We did have it,
but we sent it to the auction.

483
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:07,658
- Christie's? Sotheby's?
- No, my women's club charity auction.

484
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:11,119
Oh! Well, you have to get it back.

485
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:16,083
I would if I could,
but I promised them the horse.

486
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:20,254
- And a Brady always keeps a promise.
- Yeah.

487
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:22,965
There is one thing we could do.

488
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:27,135
You could bid on it yourself, tomorrow.
But... Oh, Roy...

489
00:40:27,344 --> 00:40:32,808
- What do you mean, "Oh, Roy"?
- They're valuing it at fifty dollars.

490
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:36,019
Fifty dollars?

491
00:40:36,228 --> 00:40:39,481
Fifty dollars and I have it,
free and clear?

492
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:45,237
Carol, I love you.

493
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:54,997
Yes! Yes! Yes!

494
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:01,587
- Hey, Mr Martin.
- What can I do for you?

495
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:05,799
- I'm in a fix. I need advice.
- Put yourself up for adoption.

496
00:41:06,008 --> 00:41:10,512
Dad wants me to be an architect
but I want to be an adventurer like you.

497
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:14,391
- Mr Martin, what should I do?
- Stop whining.

498
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:19,021
Being top dog is what it's all about.
Show people who's boss.

499
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:22,774
Even if you have to lie,
cheat, steal or kill.

500
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:27,529
Without that attitude, I never
would have made it in the big house.

501
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:31,158
Lie, cheat, steal or kill.
Thanks, Mr Martin.

502
00:41:31,366 --> 00:41:34,328
- Maybe we can play catch later.
- Great idea.

503
00:41:34,536 --> 00:41:36,163
Outta sight!

504
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:42,669
Troops! Dinner!

505
00:41:42,878 --> 00:41:45,756
Alice, do you have to shout like that?

506
00:41:54,348 --> 00:41:57,434
I wonder who that could be.

507
00:42:03,607 --> 00:42:07,194
- Hi, I've got...
- Flowers for Jan Brady? Thank you.

508
00:42:09,571 --> 00:42:12,574
They're from my boyfriend,
George Glass.

509
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:20,749
How did he know
that daisies are my favourite?

510
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:26,880
- Forgot your change.
- Keep it!

511
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:34,721
The delivery boy wanted one more look
at the beautiful Jan Brady.

512
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:37,641
- Isn't that sweet?
- That's nice.

513
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:41,103
I'm curious.
How come George never calls here?

514
00:42:41,311 --> 00:42:42,729
What?

515
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:49,695
If he's as crazy about you as you say,
the phone would be ringing off the hook.

516
00:42:49,903 --> 00:42:54,199
Well, I'm sure he'll be calling very soon.

517
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:59,788
- Here we go!
- Meatloaf!

518
00:43:00,873 --> 00:43:05,961
Mr Martin, I noticed you didn't like my
meatloaf so I made something special.

519
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:11,592
- Spaghetti with mushroom sauce.
- Why, Alice, how thoughtful of you!

520
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:15,721
Come here, I gotcha now!

521
00:43:17,681 --> 00:43:21,226
This is mm-mm-mmm!

522
00:43:22,311 --> 00:43:25,939
Nothin' says lovin' like
a tummyful of Alice's spaghetti!

523
00:43:27,566 --> 00:43:31,487
- More spaghetti, Mr Martin?
- Mm-hmm!

524
00:43:31,695 --> 00:43:35,240
What kind of mushrooms
did you put in this sauce?

525
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:39,036
The ones in your room.
I thought you might like 'em.

526
00:43:39,244 --> 00:43:41,997
Some of my mushrooms!

527
00:43:42,206 --> 00:43:45,083
And they smell pretty tasty!

528
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:48,337
My room?

529
00:43:48,545 --> 00:43:50,464
My mushrooms?

530
00:43:50,672 --> 00:43:53,008
Oh, no.

531
00:43:54,343 --> 00:43:57,846
Roy? Is something wrong?

532
00:44:01,058 --> 00:44:04,228
Roy? Is something wrong?

533
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:13,403
Oh, my God!

534
00:44:13,612 --> 00:44:16,990
I'm tripping with the Bradys!

535
00:44:54,736 --> 00:44:57,531
Roy, are you all right?

536
00:44:57,739 --> 00:45:00,117
The colours were so bright!

537
00:45:00,325 --> 00:45:04,454
And you, and you, and you were there.
And Toto, too!

538
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:07,624
Oh, I love Toto. Toto!

539
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:15,340
Let's help Mr Martin to his room.
He obviously needs some rest.

540
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:18,844
Wait! Where are you taking me?
Auntie Em!

541
00:45:19,428 --> 00:45:22,723
Alice, Mr Martin just fell over at the table.

542
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:25,976
Was there something wrong
with his dinner?

543
00:45:26,185 --> 00:45:30,814
That's odd. I ate the spaghetti too,
and I feel just fine.

544
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:35,027
- Well, goodnight, Alice.
- Goodnight, Mrs Brady.

545
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:39,114
I guess I'll be going to my room now.

546
00:45:47,498 --> 00:45:49,541
Come in.

547
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:53,086
- Hi, Mommy. Hi, Daddy.
- What is it, sweetheart?

548
00:45:53,295 --> 00:45:55,923
I still haven't found Kitty Karry-All.

549
00:45:56,131 --> 00:45:59,635
What if she ran away
and is never coming back?

550
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:02,054
What am I gonna do without her?

551
00:46:02,262 --> 00:46:05,933
Sometimes growing up
means letting go of things you love.

552
00:46:06,141 --> 00:46:11,355
- I don't wanna let go of Kitty Karry-All.
- Sweetheart, your father's right.

553
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:16,360
If you don't find her, you'll find
a new doll you love just as much.

554
00:46:16,568 --> 00:46:18,570
No!

555
00:46:19,363 --> 00:46:22,783
There's no way you'd find
another doll as wonderful.

556
00:46:22,991 --> 00:46:27,871
- You'd be heartbroken if she left.
- I'm sure she didn't want to leave.

557
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,374
Maybe she didn't have a choice.

558
00:46:30,582 --> 00:46:34,920
Maybe she felt torn between
her love and her sense of duty.

559
00:46:35,128 --> 00:46:38,924
But what if Kitty Karry-All
loves somebody else?

560
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:46,348
No matter what happens, Kitty Karry-All
will never love anyone else.

561
00:46:46,557 --> 00:46:49,268
Are we talking about
the same Kitty Karry-All?

562
00:46:49,476 --> 00:46:51,395
- Yes.
- Of course.

563
00:46:51,603 --> 00:46:54,106
Now, go and get ready for breakfast.

564
00:46:54,314 --> 00:46:57,067
OK. Thanks, Mommy.

565
00:47:05,242 --> 00:47:10,581
Isn't that something! The light really
does go out when you close the door.

566
00:47:28,098 --> 00:47:31,476
I can't wait for Marcia
to hear me talk to George.

567
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:34,062
Then she'll have to believe me.

568
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:40,652
Hullo? I'd like to speak to a live guy,
preferably one named George.

569
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:46,742
What am I wearing?
A bright red jumper with floral trim.

570
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:50,037
What do you mean, "Take it off"?

571
00:47:53,373 --> 00:47:55,626
Oh, George! You're such a card!

572
00:47:55,834 --> 00:48:01,840
Hi, Marcia. Would you like to
talk to George? He just called me.

573
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:05,177
That's funny. I didn't hear the phone ring.

574
00:48:05,385 --> 00:48:08,931
That's because
I picked it up before it rang.

575
00:48:09,139 --> 00:48:11,934
George and I are so close, we have ESP.

576
00:48:12,142 --> 00:48:13,769
Well, great.

577
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:17,314
Hello, George?

578
00:48:21,443 --> 00:48:24,571
Hi, George. This is Marcia, Jan's sister.

579
00:48:25,864 --> 00:48:30,828
Ménage à trois?
Well, I'm sure you're the most, too.

580
00:48:31,036 --> 00:48:34,289
Are you coming to our parents'
surprise wedding?

581
00:48:34,498 --> 00:48:38,377
It'll cost extra?
You have to fly in from New York?

582
00:48:38,585 --> 00:48:41,046
That's right, I forgot to tell you.

583
00:48:41,255 --> 00:48:45,509
George is in New York on vacation.
He's very continental.

584
00:48:46,552 --> 00:48:50,556
Goodbye, George. Call again soon.

585
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:55,686
Nice try, Jan.

586
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:11,660
Mr Martin, are you awake?

587
00:49:11,994 --> 00:49:13,537
Mr Martin?

588
00:49:16,582 --> 00:49:19,126
Where am I?

589
00:49:19,334 --> 00:49:22,045
Right here, in my dad's den.

590
00:49:23,046 --> 00:49:25,340
Sorry to wake you up, but...

591
00:49:26,842 --> 00:49:31,597
...I need your advice.
There's this chick I'm really hung up on.

592
00:49:31,805 --> 00:49:36,059
But she's not exactly
the kind of girl I should be dating.

593
00:49:36,268 --> 00:49:39,521
Sometimes the wrong kind
can be the right kind,

594
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:42,566
if you know what I mean.

595
00:49:42,774 --> 00:49:45,861
Which you obviously don't.

596
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:49,072
What's the problem?
Her parents don't like you?

597
00:49:49,281 --> 00:49:53,827
- No! I get along great with her folks.
- Is she promiscuous?

598
00:49:54,036 --> 00:49:58,665
She's editor of the school yearbook,
president of the Davy Jones fan club...

599
00:49:58,874 --> 00:50:03,170
That's not what I meant.
Does she sleep with a lot of people?

600
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:10,135
She used to sleep with two girls,
but now she just sleeps with me.

601
00:50:10,344 --> 00:50:15,140
Whoa, Greg!
This girl is way too fast for you.

602
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:20,854
You'd be better off dating somebody
more your speed, like a librarian.

603
00:50:21,063 --> 00:50:24,942
Date somebody else?
That's a great idea!

604
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:28,320
That's how I'll forget about her.
Thanks, Mr Martin.

605
00:50:28,529 --> 00:50:30,906
Sorry to bother you.

606
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:35,369
Mr Phillips.

607
00:50:35,577 --> 00:50:37,663
You can hardly notice that.

608
00:50:37,871 --> 00:50:40,165
Come on, you bozos, get to work.

609
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:44,378
We're running a business here.
You don't get paid to sit around and loaf.

610
00:50:44,586 --> 00:50:48,423
Would anyone notice if we
mixed him in with the foundations?

611
00:50:48,632 --> 00:50:53,512
- Peter, I'd like a word with you, please.
- Sure, Dad.

612
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,598
Don't let me catch you napping!

613
00:50:57,766 --> 00:51:01,895
Peter, why were you being
so high-handed with those workers?

614
00:51:02,104 --> 00:51:07,818
I'm not letting anybody get in my way,
even if I have to lie, cheat, steal and kill.

615
00:51:08,026 --> 00:51:11,613
Roy says that's what you gotta do
to make it in the big house.

616
00:51:11,822 --> 00:51:15,826
Our house may be small
compared to what Roy's used to, but...

617
00:51:16,034 --> 00:51:19,663
Mike, I think he means prison.

618
00:51:20,873 --> 00:51:24,585
Prison? Roy didn't mention
anything about prison.

619
00:51:24,793 --> 00:51:27,880
- Who's Roy?
- My wife's husband.

620
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:31,175
I have a funny feeling about him.

621
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:35,429
Johnny! Keep an eye on Peter.
I've got something to take care of.

622
00:51:35,637 --> 00:51:40,475
My pleasure, Mr Brady.
Fellas! Load up the cement mixer.

623
00:51:52,196 --> 00:51:55,657
Alice, remind me
never to eat your cooking again.

624
00:51:55,866 --> 00:51:57,284
Mr Martin!

625
00:51:57,493 --> 00:52:00,496
- Where's Carol?
- She left for the auction.

626
00:52:00,704 --> 00:52:03,415
They started the auction?
I have to get there!

627
00:52:03,624 --> 00:52:07,794
- I can get you there.
- You? How?

628
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:12,883
How long have you been driving?

629
00:52:13,091 --> 00:52:17,137
I don't have my licence yet,
just my learner's permit.

630
00:52:17,346 --> 00:52:20,432
I'm so happy I can practise
my driving on you, Daddy!

631
00:52:27,481 --> 00:52:30,567
Oh, no! I lost my contact lens!

632
00:52:30,776 --> 00:52:34,154
- Oh, no!
- What are you doing down there?

633
00:52:35,948 --> 00:52:38,575
There's my turn!

634
00:52:41,328 --> 00:52:44,998
What are you doing?
Get off the sidewalk!

635
00:52:45,207 --> 00:52:46,792
OK!

636
00:52:54,758 --> 00:52:57,386
What an unexpected rainstorm!

637
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:04,893
We'd like to thank Mrs McCormick and
Mrs Plum for donating their mom's vase.

638
00:53:09,314 --> 00:53:13,443
Our next item is a lovely statue
donated by Carol Brady.

639
00:53:13,652 --> 00:53:15,654
One hundred dollars!

640
00:53:16,113 --> 00:53:19,616
- Roy!
- Carol, I need that horse.

641
00:53:19,825 --> 00:53:23,704
- $200.
- Who the hell is that? $250.

642
00:53:23,912 --> 00:53:27,499
Isn't it gorgeous?
The perfect gift for my sixth husband.

643
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:29,751
- Seventh.
- Who's counting?

644
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,004
I must have it. $300.

645
00:53:33,255 --> 00:53:35,841
$1,000.

646
00:53:36,967 --> 00:53:39,720
- $10,000.
- Zsa Zsa!

647
00:53:44,975 --> 00:53:50,647
Hey! This is my room now.
Why aren't you in the attic with Greg?

648
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:57,070
I don't want to be there.
He's got a date with Kathy Lawrence.

649
00:53:57,279 --> 00:54:02,576
Kathy Lawrence! That's the girl who
became head cheerleader instead of you,

650
00:54:02,784 --> 00:54:05,496
because of Greg's deciding vote.

651
00:54:05,704 --> 00:54:07,915
He can't date her!

652
00:54:08,123 --> 00:54:10,375
But he is!

653
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:15,172
So I'm going on a date, too.
With Warren Mulaney.

654
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:20,844
Warren Mulaney! That's the boy who
beat out Greg for class president...

655
00:54:21,053 --> 00:54:23,430
...and took his place
on the basketball team.

656
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:26,892
- You can't date him!
- Says who?

657
00:54:27,768 --> 00:54:31,939
So, it's just too bad
you don't have a date too, Jan.

658
00:54:32,147 --> 00:54:37,528
Oh, but I do have a date... with George.
He's back in town.

659
00:54:37,736 --> 00:54:40,697
Really? That I'd like to see.

660
00:54:41,657 --> 00:54:46,245
- Well, you will.
- If you say so.

661
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:52,000
And that, there, there... Ten.

662
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:55,587
- Thank you. Congratulations, Ms Gabor.
- Thank you.

663
00:54:55,796 --> 00:54:59,591
Lucky he ran out of cash.
He made me so mad I want to slap him.

664
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,344
Remember last time you did that?

665
00:55:02,553 --> 00:55:06,598
I wound up on CNN, <i>People</i> Magazine
and David Letterman.

666
00:55:06,807 --> 00:55:09,393
Maybe I should slap someone.

667
00:55:09,601 --> 00:55:13,230
Let's have lunch.
We'll pick up the horse later.

668
00:55:13,438 --> 00:55:16,441
- So, chilli-dogs again?
- No, sausages...

669
00:55:28,162 --> 00:55:30,789
Roy, what are you doing?

670
00:55:30,998 --> 00:55:33,167
Doing? Doing with what?

671
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:39,923
You're carrying this out
to Ms Gabor's car, aren't you?

672
00:55:40,132 --> 00:55:43,468
Well, actually, no.

673
00:55:43,677 --> 00:55:47,264
- Zsa Zsa, she gave it to me.
- Really?

674
00:55:47,472 --> 00:55:54,021
Yeah. When I told her how much
this horse meant to me, to us,

675
00:55:54,229 --> 00:55:57,774
she said she wanted me, us, to have it.

676
00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:02,112
Roy, this horse is very important to you,
isn't it?

677
00:56:02,321 --> 00:56:06,450
Oh yes, Carol.
It symbolises our marriage.

678
00:56:06,658 --> 00:56:09,953
And I am never letting go of it.

679
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:15,751
Never letting go of it.

680
00:56:20,047 --> 00:56:24,885
Tell that greaseball scumbag
if he does it again I'll break his legs.

681
00:56:25,093 --> 00:56:28,222
Put pressure on him.
Stick his head in the toilet.

682
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:31,016
Officer? I need you
to check on someone.

683
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:33,602
We're kind of busy here, thank you.

684
00:56:33,811 --> 00:56:36,396
- It's about the family.
- The Mafia?

685
00:56:36,605 --> 00:56:39,024
- No, the Bradys.
- Bradys? Sorry.

686
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:44,863
A man named Roy Martin may not
have been entirely honest with us.

687
00:56:45,072 --> 00:56:48,575
- He may have spent time in prison.
- Hold that thought.

688
00:56:48,784 --> 00:56:53,789
For Christ's sake, he killed
the babysitter! Find him. Now!

689
00:56:54,706 --> 00:56:57,417
As you can see,
I have a heavy caseload.

690
00:56:57,626 --> 00:57:00,921
I got killers, gang-bangers,
dope-dealers...

691
00:57:01,129 --> 00:57:05,592
- Maybe I can run a check on this guy.
- You will? That's great.

692
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:09,179
- It'll take about three weeks.
- Three weeks?

693
00:57:09,388 --> 00:57:14,184
The LA Police Department
is famous for protecting its citizens...

694
00:57:14,393 --> 00:57:18,647
...and dispensing even-handed justice.
It'll take you three weeks?

695
00:57:18,856 --> 00:57:23,861
Look, we need his fingerprints.
Do you have something of his?

696
00:57:24,069 --> 00:57:28,073
- Of course not. Why would I?
- I give up.

697
00:57:28,282 --> 00:57:30,742
Wait a minute, Officer!

698
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:34,413
Will these do?

699
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:43,839
Marcia and I bet each other a month's
chores over who did the best driving test.

700
00:57:44,047 --> 00:57:50,137
- You seem preoccupied with your sister.
- Well, let's not talk about her.

701
00:57:50,345 --> 00:57:55,934
She's a way-out, happening kinda chick.
You're groovy too, in your own way.

702
00:57:56,143 --> 00:57:59,813
OK. Are you the skinny,
decaf, mochaccino grande?

703
00:58:00,022 --> 00:58:03,567
- Who are you calling skinny?
- It's a drink, Greg.

704
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:06,403
That's mine, actually.

705
00:58:06,612 --> 00:58:09,239
Marcia! With Warren Mulaney?

706
00:58:09,448 --> 00:58:13,535
It's a free country.
I can go out with anyone I want to.

707
00:58:13,744 --> 00:58:16,163
Is there a problem here, Greg?

708
00:58:16,371 --> 00:58:20,125
No, not at all. Everything's groovy.

709
00:58:20,334 --> 00:58:23,378
- In fact, why don't we sit together?
- Good idea.

710
00:58:23,587 --> 00:58:26,840
- Together?
- Trust me, it's for the best.

711
00:58:29,843 --> 00:58:32,054
Oh, good! They're here!

712
00:58:33,138 --> 00:58:35,516
Come on, George!

713
00:58:46,693 --> 00:58:51,573
- So, what kind of music do you like?
- I'm really into hip-hop.

714
00:58:51,782 --> 00:58:56,036
Hip-hop? Sounds like
something a rabbit listens to.

715
00:59:01,834 --> 00:59:04,127
Oh, George!

716
00:59:04,336 --> 00:59:07,631
A kiss? In public?

717
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,551
You're so romantic!

718
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:18,308
It must be a performance art kinda thing.

719
00:59:19,393 --> 00:59:24,731
Sometimes I wear it in a French twist,
and sometimes just in a ponytail.

720
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:28,152
Other times, I take
two strands to the back...

721
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,863
...and attach them with a cute clasp.

722
00:59:31,071 --> 00:59:33,782
Tell them how you wash and condition it.

723
00:59:43,292 --> 00:59:47,087
That time we did the Charleston
was the absolute tops!

724
00:59:47,296 --> 00:59:51,758
Marcia, I gotta go.
I'm about to be paged.

725
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:55,596
- Take me with you!
- Sure.

726
00:59:57,514 --> 01:00:00,851
Bye, Marcia, it's been...

727
01:00:01,852 --> 01:00:04,730
Well, it's been scary.

728
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:12,571
Oh, no! What about my ride?

729
01:00:15,032 --> 01:00:18,118
Now who's gonna drive me home?

730
01:00:19,786 --> 01:00:22,623
Well, I have my car, Marcia.

731
01:00:37,596 --> 01:00:40,599
Oh, George. Pull yourself together!

732
01:00:44,812 --> 01:00:47,147
Oh, no! They're gone!

733
01:00:47,356 --> 01:00:49,817
Wait for us!

734
01:00:52,945 --> 01:00:55,280
We gotta catch their next show!

735
01:00:56,615 --> 01:01:00,536
- I hope we find Kitty Karry-All.
- What's in that box?

736
01:01:00,744 --> 01:01:04,122
Marcia's trophies
that couldn't fit in the attic.

737
01:01:04,331 --> 01:01:09,086
"Most Popular Girl at Westdale High",
"Most Popular Girl at Summer Camp".

738
01:01:09,294 --> 01:01:12,464
"Girl Most Likely to be Popular
the Rest of her Life".

739
01:01:12,673 --> 01:01:15,008
Look, Marcia's diary.

740
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:18,512
I bet it's filled with mature,
womanly thoughts.

741
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:25,644
"And some day, my dream of dreams
is to be Mrs Desi Arnaz Jr."

742
01:01:28,105 --> 01:01:30,983
Bobby, look! It's Kitty Karry-All.

743
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:35,571
I'm so glad I found her!
She must have got in here by mistake.

744
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:39,908
Not now, Cindy.
I've found something in this old suitcase.

745
01:01:40,117 --> 01:01:42,494
- Something more important.
- What is it?

746
01:01:42,703 --> 01:01:47,624
A picture, I think it was your dad's.
I don't think Roy is really Roy.

747
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:50,210
He looks like this guy named Trevor.

748
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,298
- Greg.
- Marcia.

749
01:01:54,506 --> 01:01:56,800
- You go first.
- You go first.

750
01:01:57,009 --> 01:02:02,764
I'm really sorry about Kathy Lawrence.
I never should have voted for her.

751
01:02:02,973 --> 01:02:08,312
I realise now that she'll never
have half as much pep as you.

752
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:13,275
Thanks, Greg.
It's really sweet of you to say that.

753
01:02:13,484 --> 01:02:19,198
To be honest, I don't think Warren
Mulaney's that great a basketball player.

754
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:23,202
I'd rather watch you score any day.

755
01:02:27,122 --> 01:02:29,082
Marcia?

756
01:02:31,293 --> 01:02:33,045
Yes, Greg?

757
01:02:33,879 --> 01:02:39,968
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- I think I'm thinking what you're thinking.

758
01:02:53,273 --> 01:02:55,692
- It's terrible!
- What's going on?

759
01:02:56,777 --> 01:02:59,947
- Shadow puppets.
- Right!

760
01:03:00,155 --> 01:03:03,075
- A hippopotamus?
- No time for that.

761
01:03:03,283 --> 01:03:06,328
Greg, Marcia,
there's something fishy going on.

762
01:03:06,537 --> 01:03:08,205
- No, there's not!
- No, there's not!

763
01:03:08,413 --> 01:03:14,086
- Yes, there is. Look what we found.
- Roy lied.

764
01:03:16,839 --> 01:03:20,968
Roy, could we talk for a minute
before we go inside?

765
01:03:21,176 --> 01:03:25,138
I don't know how to say this,
so I'll blurt it out.

766
01:03:25,347 --> 01:03:30,310
- I don't love you the way you love me.
- The way I love you?

767
01:03:30,519 --> 01:03:35,065
Don't say a word.
Getting that horse back today said it all.

768
01:03:35,274 --> 01:03:39,444
You'd like to go back
to the way things were, but I can't.

769
01:03:39,653 --> 01:03:46,326
I have a whole new life here, with Mike.
And the kids. And Alice.

770
01:03:46,535 --> 01:03:50,747
Can you possibly understand that?

771
01:03:50,956 --> 01:03:52,332
Some day...

772
01:03:52,541 --> 01:03:56,295
...somehow, some way...

773
01:03:56,503 --> 01:03:59,173
...I'll get by.

774
01:04:01,592 --> 01:04:03,635
Later!

775
01:04:06,221 --> 01:04:12,060
Hey, JD! I've got it! I'll be on my way
as soon as the coast is clear.

776
01:04:12,269 --> 01:04:14,062
Mom, we need to talk.

777
01:04:14,271 --> 01:04:16,982
- Mr Martin's a liar.
- And a jailbird.

778
01:04:17,191 --> 01:04:21,111
Kids! Mr Martin is still
a guest in this house.

779
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:26,825
Bradys always treat guests with warmth,
especially if they're part of the family.

780
01:04:27,034 --> 01:04:31,330
- But that's it. He's not.
- What?

781
01:04:31,538 --> 01:04:33,999
Take a look.

782
01:04:35,334 --> 01:04:39,546
Oh, boy! Roy's not Roy.
This can't be.

783
01:04:39,755 --> 01:04:43,717
Actually, Carol, for once,
your kids make sense.

784
01:04:43,926 --> 01:04:46,220
Hard to believe, I know.

785
01:04:46,428 --> 01:04:50,140
- You told us you were Roy Martin.
- I lied.

786
01:04:50,349 --> 01:04:52,726
It's not nice to lie.

787
01:04:52,935 --> 01:04:58,816
Oh, Carol. One word of advice.
Send Cindy to a special school.

788
01:04:59,942 --> 01:05:04,279
- Why lie to us?
- It's a simple matter of a horse.

789
01:05:04,488 --> 01:05:09,451
A man in Hawaii is waiting to pay me
$20 million for this baby.

790
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:12,246
Translated for the decade-impaired,

791
01:05:12,454 --> 01:05:16,083
I could make some groovy dough.
Isn't that neat-o?

792
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:19,503
The police will track you down.

793
01:05:19,711 --> 01:05:23,382
I'd better make sure
nobody calls the police.

794
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:28,178
Carol, you're coming with me.
If you talk to the cops, your mom gets it.

795
01:05:28,387 --> 01:05:32,349
- You can't take my mommy!
- Cindy's right.

796
01:05:33,267 --> 01:05:35,602
- Take Jan!
- Don't take Mom!

797
01:05:35,811 --> 01:05:37,229
Kids!

798
01:05:41,066 --> 01:05:43,610
Alice, watch out! Mr Martin has a gun.

799
01:05:43,819 --> 01:05:46,989
And I'm not afraid to use it,
especially on you.

800
01:05:48,991 --> 01:05:53,203
- Mr Martin, you won't get away with this.
- Oh, really?

801
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:03,422
<i>If I'd been a better detective,</i>
<i>I'd have been on to him sooner.</i>

802
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:06,008
<i>This is all my fault.</i>

803
01:06:06,216 --> 01:06:11,388
<i>If I wasn't so busy looking for my doll,</i>
<i>I'd have seen something suspicious.</i>

804
01:06:11,597 --> 01:06:14,683
<i>This is all my fault.</i>

805
01:06:15,976 --> 01:06:20,898
<i>I bet he wouldn't have tied me up</i>
<i>if I was Barbie. This is all my fault.</i>

806
01:06:21,106 --> 01:06:26,028
<i>What a dumb-head I am.</i>
<i>Roy's not much of a hero after all.</i>

807
01:06:26,236 --> 01:06:29,031
<i>This is all my fault.</i>

808
01:06:29,239 --> 01:06:34,453
<i>I didn't put enough mushrooms in his</i>
<i>spaghetti sauce. This is all my fault.</i>

809
01:06:35,621 --> 01:06:38,707
<i>Marcia looks great in those ropes.</i>

810
01:06:38,916 --> 01:06:42,586
<i>Wait, what am I saying?</i>
<i>This is all my fault!</i>

811
01:06:43,295 --> 01:06:48,091
<i>It was wrong to make up George Glass.</i>
<i>This is all my fault.</i>

812
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:53,806
<i>This is all Jan's fault.</i>

813
01:06:54,848 --> 01:06:56,391
- Carol?
- Dad!

814
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,728
- Kids!
- We gotta tell you...

815
01:06:59,937 --> 01:07:05,150
I know all about him from the police.
He's not a nice guy after all.

816
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:08,737
And he's kidnapped Mom
and taken her to Hawaii.

817
01:07:08,946 --> 01:07:13,575
He threatened my kids, kidnapped
my wife and abused my hospitality.

818
01:07:13,784 --> 01:07:18,580
He's going to pay. Alice,
pack the flowered shirts and sandals.

819
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:23,836
- We're going to Hawaii.
- Hawaii! Wow!

820
01:07:25,546 --> 01:07:27,506
Daddy?

821
01:07:27,714 --> 01:07:30,133
- Dad?
- Please, help us!

822
01:07:31,468 --> 01:07:35,722
So, Hawaii was formed
by underwater volcanoes.

823
01:07:35,931 --> 01:07:41,270
Cooling lava shaped the mountains
that became this island chain.

824
01:07:41,478 --> 01:07:44,439
Oh, my gosh! I forgot my hairbrush!

825
01:07:44,648 --> 01:07:47,776
California's coastline
was formed by earthquakes...

826
01:07:47,985 --> 01:07:50,070
...which began thousands of years ago...

827
01:07:54,783 --> 01:08:00,122
I've marked your exit. I hope you
and your wife enjoy our lush mountains.

828
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:03,125
- I'm not his wife!
- What she means...

829
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:06,753
No need to explain.
We're very open-minded here.

830
01:08:06,962 --> 01:08:10,048
You may know of our policies
for gay people.

831
01:08:10,257 --> 01:08:14,970
I wish I could be gay again.
I would be, if I were with Marcia.

832
01:08:15,179 --> 01:08:17,514
- And Jan. And Cindy.
- And Alice.

833
01:08:17,723 --> 01:08:19,892
- And Alice.
- Gimme the keys.

834
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:24,688
Sure. Just sign right here,
and right there.

835
01:08:27,774 --> 01:08:30,152
And initial right there.

836
01:08:45,626 --> 01:08:49,546
Don't try anything else,
or you're gonna get hurt. Ouch!

837
01:08:53,175 --> 01:08:59,056
- I hope we find Mom in time.
- Don't worry. Everything will work out.

838
01:08:59,264 --> 01:09:04,019
Isn't there something we could do
to cheer ourselves up?

839
01:09:04,228 --> 01:09:07,272
Hey, I know!

840
01:09:12,152 --> 01:09:18,492
<i>Let me hear some of that</i>
<i>good-time music that I love to hear</i>

841
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:23,163
<i>I got plenty of blues and sorta bad news</i>

842
01:09:23,413 --> 01:09:27,042
<i>And I need to find me some cheer</i>

843
01:09:29,127 --> 01:09:33,715
<i>There've been some times</i>
<i>when I've been down</i>

844
01:09:33,924 --> 01:09:36,468
<i>More so recently</i>

845
01:09:36,677 --> 01:09:41,140
<i>I gotta piece it back right</i>
<i>and make a new flight</i>

846
01:09:41,348 --> 01:09:44,977
<i>React positively</i>

847
01:09:47,855 --> 01:09:54,444
<i>There's no sense in walking around</i>
<i>with your feet stuck to the ground</i>

848
01:09:55,404 --> 01:09:58,657
<i>It's much better to put yourself together</i>

849
01:09:58,866 --> 01:10:03,245
<i>Create a lot of lovin' good vibes</i>
<i>for humanity</i>

850
01:10:03,453 --> 01:10:05,539
I wish they'd shut up.

851
01:10:05,747 --> 01:10:08,667
<i>That's fine with me</i>

852
01:10:15,465 --> 01:10:22,097
<i>Let me hear some of that</i>
<i>good-time music that I love to hear</i>

853
01:10:22,306 --> 01:10:26,477
<i>I got plenty of blues and sorta bad news</i>

854
01:10:26,685 --> 01:10:30,689
<i>And I need to find me some cheer</i>

855
01:10:30,898 --> 01:10:34,151
<i>Good-time music</i>

856
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:36,528
<i>Good-time music</i>

857
01:10:36,737 --> 01:10:39,156
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

858
01:10:39,364 --> 01:10:43,869
<i>Those dancing and singing in the aisles,</i>
<i>please sit down and shut up.</i>

859
01:10:44,077 --> 01:10:47,289
- Hear! Hear!
- Thank you!

860
01:10:50,209 --> 01:10:52,961
<i>Good-time music...</i>

861
01:11:02,888 --> 01:11:04,723
About time!

862
01:11:21,323 --> 01:11:26,078
If you're not Roy Martin, I demand
you tell me what happened to him.

863
01:11:26,286 --> 01:11:32,417
I'll tell you later. I wanna concentrate
on how filthy rich I'm gonna be.

864
01:11:32,626 --> 01:11:36,588
Careful!
I don't want two dead husbands.

865
01:11:37,965 --> 01:11:42,803
Well, actually, it'd be one dead husband
and one dead impostor.

866
01:11:43,011 --> 01:11:46,640
Really, it would be one
possibly dead husband...

867
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:49,351
...and one potentially dead impostor.

868
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,688
Painful to the very end.

869
01:11:53,522 --> 01:11:56,024
Here we go, come on!

870
01:11:56,233 --> 01:11:59,111
Come on, Romeo!

871
01:11:59,319 --> 01:12:03,574
All right. The best way
to find your mother is to split up.

872
01:12:05,534 --> 01:12:09,454
- Where's Marcia?
- Getting lei'd by those Hawaiian boys.

873
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,086
- Marcia!
- Coming, Dad!

874
01:12:19,673 --> 01:12:23,760
OK, kids. Leave no stone unturned
nor mountain unclimbed.

875
01:12:23,969 --> 01:12:29,224
And this is no time for a long speech,
but as a wise man once said...

876
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,107
- Let's go find your mother!
- Yeah!

877
01:12:40,527 --> 01:12:45,949
- OK, Bobby, keep your eyes peeled.
- I don't see her anywhere.

878
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:49,661
- Mom!
- I'm right here, sweetheart!

879
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,124
Carol!

880
01:12:57,794 --> 01:13:00,464
Mrs Brady!

881
01:13:07,137 --> 01:13:10,140
Justin! Cool your jets!

882
01:13:10,349 --> 01:13:14,228
- Welcome. How may I help you?
- Have you seen my mother?

883
01:13:14,436 --> 01:13:18,357
Honey! We're all checked out.
Let's go over this again.

884
01:13:18,565 --> 01:13:20,317
- Luggage? Tickets?
- Check.

885
01:13:20,526 --> 01:13:22,444
Kid?

886
01:13:23,695 --> 01:13:27,658
- I know he was here a minute ago.
- Honey...

887
01:13:27,866 --> 01:13:32,871
George! George Gunther Glass,
we're gonna be late!

888
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,123
George Glass?

889
01:13:36,458 --> 01:13:38,293
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

890
01:13:42,047 --> 01:13:43,382
Hi!

891
01:13:45,175 --> 01:13:46,718
Hi!

892
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:52,516
I can't believe I got so upset
about losing my doll.

893
01:13:52,724 --> 01:13:58,355
Losing your mommy's so much worse.
I'm just a big baby.

894
01:13:58,564 --> 01:14:02,442
It's OK, Cindy.
Everybody grows up at different times.

895
01:14:02,651 --> 01:14:07,114
When it's right for you, you'll know.
Hey, look! There's Greg.

896
01:14:10,534 --> 01:14:12,578
Mom!

897
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:24,047
Oh, no! Greg's hurt!
Lucky I took that life-saving class.

898
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:26,425
Greg!

899
01:14:43,775 --> 01:14:48,947
- Greg! Where are you going?
- Something suddenly came up.

900
01:14:49,656 --> 01:14:53,994
- Have you seen this woman?
- I gave her and her friend a Jeep.

901
01:14:54,203 --> 01:14:57,998
- That friend is no friend at all.
- Who are you?

902
01:14:58,207 --> 01:15:02,127
- I'm her husband.
- Really? Her husband?

903
01:15:02,336 --> 01:15:06,381
It's not my business,
but she said she wanted to be gay.

904
01:15:06,590 --> 01:15:09,384
Of course! We all do, don't we, kids?

905
01:15:09,593 --> 01:15:13,847
That's why we need to find her.
Do you know where they went?

906
01:15:21,146 --> 01:15:23,649
What the hell was that?

907
01:15:31,573 --> 01:15:33,617
Oh, great!

908
01:15:40,457 --> 01:15:42,543
Of all the bad luck!

909
01:15:46,755 --> 01:15:50,133
Carol, get out of the car.
We're walking.

910
01:15:50,342 --> 01:15:52,177
Carol!

911
01:15:53,053 --> 01:15:58,058
Oh, my! It's windy.
Thank goodness I use Aquanet.

912
01:16:04,231 --> 01:16:07,067
Look, kids, we're in luck.

913
01:16:07,276 --> 01:16:13,115
- We may have found Roy's Jeep.
- How can you be so sure?

914
01:16:13,323 --> 01:16:18,370
- Wait, I think Dad's right.
- How do you know?

915
01:16:18,579 --> 01:16:23,125
Any detective would realise
this is yarn from Mom's needlepoint.

916
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:25,210
Good job!

917
01:16:25,419 --> 01:16:29,173
Your mother's clever.
She's leaving clues so we can follow.

918
01:16:29,381 --> 01:16:33,260
Oh, darn! I must have dropped my yarn.

919
01:17:01,872 --> 01:17:06,418
Dr Whitehead, I found this woman
trespassing in the cave.

920
01:17:06,627 --> 01:17:09,463
- So I see.
- Coffee?

921
01:17:09,671 --> 01:17:13,467
She looks harmless enough.
You can let her go.

922
01:17:13,675 --> 01:17:15,844
Yes, sir.

923
01:17:16,053 --> 01:17:19,723
Let me guess.
You got separated from your tour group.

924
01:17:20,599 --> 01:17:23,852
I have to warn you,
or something terrible could happen.

925
01:17:24,061 --> 01:17:26,814
If you let me tell you the truth,
I can save us.

926
01:17:27,022 --> 01:17:29,316
Oh, you're a Jehovah's Witness.

927
01:17:29,525 --> 01:17:34,196
No, I'm a Brady.
But you must listen to me.

928
01:17:34,404 --> 01:17:40,327
All right, but make it quick.
I'm expecting someone very important.

929
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:53,006
- The yarn ends here, everybody.
- What are we gonna do?

930
01:17:53,215 --> 01:17:55,008
This is awful!

931
01:17:55,217 --> 01:17:57,970
Now we'll never find Mom!

932
01:17:58,178 --> 01:18:03,183
We'll have to cancel the wedding
and no one will see my new barrette.

933
01:18:03,392 --> 01:18:06,854
I see a shoe-print,
a Ferragamo just like Mom's.

934
01:18:07,062 --> 01:18:11,066
What are we waiting for? Let's go!

935
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:32,838
Dr Whitehead, I presume.
I'm Trevor Thomas.

936
01:18:33,046 --> 01:18:36,258
Yes, I've been waiting for you.
Macadamia nut?

937
01:18:36,466 --> 01:18:38,343
No.

938
01:18:38,552 --> 01:18:42,222
There we go. Isn't she a beauty?

939
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:47,269
Glorious. I've been collecting
antiquities for decades,

940
01:18:47,478 --> 01:18:52,191
but never have I seen anything
quite so wonderful as this horse.

941
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:57,571
Whatever. I'm in a hurry, so if you
don't mind giving me the $20 million...

942
01:18:57,779 --> 01:19:01,783
- Unfortunately, I cannot do that.
- Why not?

943
01:19:01,992 --> 01:19:07,789
Because this is what we connoisseurs
of the fine arts call a hot horse.

944
01:19:07,998 --> 01:19:10,792
What are you talking about?

945
01:19:12,628 --> 01:19:16,715
- Oh, my God!
- Mrs Brady told me quite a story.

946
01:19:16,924 --> 01:19:19,718
You can't believe her! Look at her!

947
01:19:19,927 --> 01:19:24,348
The hair, the clothes,
the constant cheerfulness.

948
01:19:24,556 --> 01:19:29,186
Be that as it may,
she told me how you sabotaged the boat...

949
01:19:29,436 --> 01:19:32,689
...when you found the horse
and bad luck for you,

950
01:19:32,898 --> 01:19:36,485
my son was first mate on that boat.

951
01:19:36,693 --> 01:19:42,157
So, thanks to you,
I'll never see my boy, Gilligan, again.

952
01:19:42,366 --> 01:19:44,910
I'll never see my husband, The Professor.

953
01:19:45,118 --> 01:19:49,623
Let's not be hasty. Maybe the ship
washed up on a desert isle.

954
01:19:49,832 --> 01:19:52,876
Enough! The very idea
of those poor people...

955
01:19:53,085 --> 01:19:56,588
...stuck on an island
for the rest of their lives!

956
01:19:56,797 --> 01:19:59,842
No, let's face it. <i>The Minnow</i> was lost.

957
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:04,263
I wouldn't buy that horse from you
if my life depended on it.

958
01:20:04,471 --> 01:20:07,307
Funnily enough, it does.

959
01:20:08,225 --> 01:20:12,521
- Give me the money.
- If only Mike were here!

960
01:20:13,188 --> 01:20:15,482
- I am here, honey!
- Mark!

961
01:20:15,691 --> 01:20:18,902
- Mike!
- Mom!

962
01:20:19,236 --> 01:20:22,156
- All right?
- I'm so glad to see you!

963
01:20:22,364 --> 01:20:26,410
- You have some explaining to do.
- Let me clarify things.

964
01:20:26,618 --> 01:20:29,496
You're a loser
and I'm getting $20 million.

965
01:20:29,705 --> 01:20:34,042
I don't think so. The Hawaiian police
will be here any minute.

966
01:20:34,251 --> 01:20:35,711
What?

967
01:20:35,919 --> 01:20:39,506
- That's it, Brady.
- Careful, he's got a gun.

968
01:20:40,215 --> 01:20:43,677
I don't need a gun to take care of you.

969
01:20:43,886 --> 01:20:46,805
I am gonna kick your Brady butt.

970
01:20:48,223 --> 01:20:51,268
He said the B-word!

971
01:20:51,477 --> 01:20:56,773
Mister, you've deceived my family,
stolen our horse and kidnapped my wife.

972
01:20:56,982 --> 01:21:01,236
But when you use language like that,
you've crossed a line.

973
01:21:01,445 --> 01:21:06,158
Now, kids. You know that fighting
is no way to solve a problem...

974
01:21:06,366 --> 01:21:09,495
- Not now, I'm trying to make a point.
- Try this.

975
01:21:17,127 --> 01:21:21,798
Caveat emptor, Roy,
or whatever your name is.

976
01:21:22,007 --> 01:21:25,344
- Dad! Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

977
01:21:25,552 --> 01:21:28,263
Dad, I'm ready
to go back to work with you.

978
01:21:28,472 --> 01:21:31,016
- Architects kick...
- Peter!

979
01:21:31,225 --> 01:21:33,811
Architects are neat-o.

980
01:21:34,019 --> 01:21:39,858
I used to think you were the most,
but it turns out you're all wet.

981
01:21:41,193 --> 01:21:46,323
- I'm glad you're my only daddy, Daddy!
- Oh, sweetheart!

982
01:21:51,745 --> 01:21:55,207
They're going to put Trevor away
for a long time.

983
01:21:55,415 --> 01:21:59,670
I know where I'd like to put you
for a long time, Mr Brady.

984
01:21:59,878 --> 01:22:05,509
It will be my pleasure to buy that horse
from you, Mr Brady, for $20 million.

985
01:22:07,386 --> 01:22:12,349
That's very generous of you,
Dr Whitehead, but I have to decline.

986
01:22:12,558 --> 01:22:17,271
There's only one place for this horse,
in our living room.

987
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:21,275
All the money in the world
can't buy togetherness.

988
01:22:21,483 --> 01:22:27,072
I respect your decision but I'd be lying
if I said it didn't make me sad.

989
01:22:27,281 --> 01:22:30,576
- Would this help?
- But, Cindy...

990
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:34,496
You can't give her away!
You went bananas without her.

991
01:22:34,705 --> 01:22:41,044
I know. But now I have my mommy,
this doll doesn't seem so important.

992
01:22:42,462 --> 01:22:45,966
So, do you want her?

993
01:22:46,175 --> 01:22:52,306
Thank you, Cindy. I will cherish her
as if she were my own.

994
01:22:53,515 --> 01:22:58,520
- Our little girl is growing up, Mike.
- I certainly am.

995
01:22:58,729 --> 01:23:03,192
- Hey, Thindy'th lotht her lithp!
- Oh, Jan!

996
01:23:04,526 --> 01:23:10,032
- Looks like everything's back to normal.
- In time for our anniversary surprise.

997
01:23:12,201 --> 01:23:14,369
Oh, Mike!

998
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:24,379
Oh, Mike, what a wonderful
anniversary present!

999
01:23:24,588 --> 01:23:30,886
- I never thought I'd get married again.
- You've never looked so beautiful.

1000
01:23:31,094 --> 01:23:34,264
I should have seen through Roy
from the beginning.

1001
01:23:34,473 --> 01:23:37,684
But I was so busy
trying to be a good Brady,

1002
01:23:37,893 --> 01:23:41,814
I almost lost the one thing
I love the most, my family.

1003
01:23:42,022 --> 01:23:44,191
You did the right thing, honey.

1004
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:50,447
The family you have is the one you make
and that's the only one that matters.

1005
01:23:53,367 --> 01:23:58,038
- Sorry I've been acting weird.
- I have, too.

1006
01:23:58,247 --> 01:24:03,085
I'll move back into my room and wait
for the attic until you go to college.

1007
01:24:03,293 --> 01:24:06,922
Gee! You're the best sister
a guy never had...

1008
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:10,092
No... ever had...

1009
01:24:27,526 --> 01:24:29,361
I gotta go!

1010
01:24:36,493 --> 01:24:38,245
- Tiger?
- Tiger?

1011
01:24:39,454 --> 01:24:41,665
Cousin Oliver! No!

1012
01:24:45,878 --> 01:24:50,257
Thanks for inviting me to the wedding.
I think you're super-cool.

1013
01:24:50,466 --> 01:24:54,136
Oh, George!
Want some cake?

1014
01:24:56,096 --> 01:25:00,100
Mmm, good!
I'll get us something to drink.

1015
01:25:01,518 --> 01:25:04,938
George seems really far-out.
I'm so happy for you.

1016
01:25:05,147 --> 01:25:07,733
- Really, Marcia?
- No.

1017
01:25:09,568 --> 01:25:12,654
Jan, of course I am!

1018
01:25:15,032 --> 01:25:19,328
OK, everybody.
Time to throw the bouquet!

1019
01:25:20,370 --> 01:25:23,040
- Mrs Brady, aim for me.
- Oh, Alice.

1020
01:25:23,248 --> 01:25:24,875
Good luck.

1021
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,757
Ready?

1022
01:25:32,508 --> 01:25:34,009
One...

1023
01:25:34,635 --> 01:25:37,429
...two... three!

1024
01:25:47,064 --> 01:25:50,526
Excuse me, who are you?

1025
01:25:50,734 --> 01:25:54,238
Hello. I am looking for Mike Brady.

1026
01:25:55,239 --> 01:25:57,991
I am his wife.
