1
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,752
My people, my people.

2
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,460
Now, the new government
has announced

3
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,841
free education for all.

4
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:44,380
All they want is for you to turn up
with a birth certificate.

5
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:48,972
A government that keeps its promise?
Unbelievable!

6
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,212
My son needs to be educated.

7
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,045
Kamau Chege,
Kamau Chege. Chege!

8
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,810
Teacher Jane, Teacher Jane!
Come on, he's asking for you.

9
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,100
Please!

10
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,859
Teacher Katherine!

11
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,567
Teacher Katherine, can you come?

12
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,232
OK, give me a moment, please.

13
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,698
This is not a birth certificate.
Mama, you are not the first.

14
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,584
May I help you, mzee?

15
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,586
This is a primary school.

16
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:53,058
Mzee, they meant children, not adults.

17
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:57,688
No. I heard on the radio,
with my own ears.

18
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,270
They said everybody.

19
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,527
We have 200 students
and only 50 desks. Look at this.

20
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,565
We can't waste them on an old man
with one foot in the grave.

21
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,733
Mzee, where are your exercise books?

22
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,620
You need two,
and one HB pencil, sharp,

23
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,155
with a rubber on one end.

24
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,369
Those are the regulations.

25
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:27,421
Pole, mzee. Pole.

26
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,868
Good morning, boys and girls.

27
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,379
Good morning, madam!

28
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:08,292
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you, madam!

29
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,008
- How do you do?
- How do you do, madam?

30
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,218
I do very well, thank you.

31
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,930
I am so excited to have you here
all in my classroom.

32
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,891
Welcome. Karibuni.
Sit down, please.

33
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,897
Thank you, madam.

34
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:26,060
Now, I know that some of you
may be a little nervous,

35
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,977
but there's nothing to be afraid of.

36
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,899
Learning is about having fun,
so we are all here to have fun.

37
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,487
- Si ndiyo?
- Yes.

38
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,778
Alright, let me check.
Has everybody got their books?

39
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,117
- Yes!
- Very good!

40
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,657
- And has everybody got their pencils?
- Yes!

41
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:44,453
- OK. Good... I heard a few noes.
- Who said no?

42
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,418
OK, well, Francis, can you give out
some pencils, please?

43
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,833
OK...

44
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,844
Paris and Pauline,
come to the front, please.

45
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,175
So, everyone, tomorrow,
your books and your pencils.

46
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,092
- Yes.
- OK, very good, very good.

47
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,061
Sorry, sorry, excuse me.

48
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:17,365
Go home, mzee.
I can see you've had a hard life.

49
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,495
Go home and rest in peace.

50
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,202
Rest in peace?

51
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,866
I'm not dead.

52
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,625
Look, mzee...

53
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:30,132
My name is Kimani Ng'ang'a Maruge.

54
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:34,260
Well, Kimani Ng'ang'a Maruge,

55
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,343
we cannot accept anyone
without a school uniform,

56
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,554
and that means school shoes too.

57
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,436
And you do not have money
for such things.

58
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,766
Jane?

59
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:55,532
Mzee, why does someone as old as you
want to go to school?

60
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,613
I want to learn to read.

61
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,574
We've got too many pupils already.

62
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,282
I wish I could help you.

63
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:08,170
I'm sorry. Pole.

64
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,186
Alright, here we are.

65
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:52,269
- OK, asante sana.
- Asante.

66
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,979
Goodbye, Teacher.

67
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,277
You know that old man
I told you about?

68
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,659
He came back again.

69
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,242
I hope you did not let him in.

70
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,998
The poor old boy might be senile.

71
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,706
Why don't you stick to battles
you can win, hm?

72
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,962
Like finding more desks.

73
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,882
How was your week?

74
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:21,670
The Swedish company
hasn't paid me the consulting fee.

75
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,715
The government job is starting to sound
very appealing.

76
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:27,259
Except it had to be full time
in Nairobi,

77
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,598
and then we'd never
see each other at all.

78
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,728
Not if you came to Nairobi.

79
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,769
We'll live in a big house, make babies.

80
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,811
Have a little bunch of Obinchus.

81
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,824
Charles, I can't.

82
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,985
The school needs me.

83
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,994
What about me?

84
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,581
You've got me.

85
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,755
We've got five children
to a desk here, sir.

86
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,423
There are children sitting on the floor.

87
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:15,389
They can't work like this, Mr. Kipruto.

88
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:23,318
You need a form for every single
new child, in triplicate?

89
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,275
No, you can't be serious. I don't
have time to do that, Mr. Kipruto.

90
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,861
Could you not just take my word for it?

91
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:32,323
Yes, I know, regulations.

92
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,613
Good day to you too, Mr. Kipruto.

93
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,790
What am I to do, Alfred?

94
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,795
Our esteemed superintendent has made
one of his executive decisions.

95
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,582
You've got to see this.

96
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,716
What?

97
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,485
You don't give up easily,
do you, Maruge?

98
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,942
You can't fall for this.

99
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,403
You'll be asking for trouble
with the authorities.

100
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,363
You know he's right, Maruge?

101
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,950
What will I say to
the board of education?

102
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,864
Hm?

103
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:21,205
What will I say to the parents?

104
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,586
I'll be a good pupil.

105
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,380
I'll work very hard.

106
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:27,916
If Kipruto finds out...

107
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,335
Kipruto's not the head here, Alfred.

108
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,799
I am.

109
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,471
Let him in.

110
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,267
I'm making an executive decision.

111
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,527
Let Maruge in.

112
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:04,084
Maruge? Welcome.

113
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,836
Karibu.

114
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,862
Thank you.

115
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,077
Francis, take your seat.

116
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,205
Class, we have a new student today,

117
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,795
and his name is Maruge.

118
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,676
Welcome, Maruge!

119
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,261
Jennifer, raise your hand, please.

120
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,896
I would like you to go
and sit next to Jennifer

121
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,648
at the back there, please, Maruge.

122
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:11,026
If I sit far, I won't see. I can't.

123
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,562
OK.

124
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,073
Uh... Suzanne, can you sit there?

125
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:19,486
Sarah, can you sit next to Niva, please?

126
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,780
Maruge, you can sit there.

127
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,916
Sit next to Niva, OK, Sarah?

128
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,498
Back down. Yes? Good.

129
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,797
Let's begin!

130
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,630
Open your exercise books.

131
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,136
Pencils nice and sharp.

132
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,217
Nice and sharp!

133
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,303
My pencil is my friend.

134
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,934
I keep him to the end.

135
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,687
My pencil is my friend.

136
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,473
I keep him to the end.

137
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:55,272
OK, we are going to begin
with small letters today,

138
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:59,158
beginning with the letter 'A', OK?

139
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:03,571
And this is how we write
our small letter 'A'.

140
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:09,585
OK, a fatty, a thinny.

141
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:14,715
A fatty, a thinny.

142
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:18,503
Please continue writing
your lower-case 'A's.

143
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,423
Brendan, Brendan. Sorry, darling.

144
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,764
Maruge, this is how you hold a pencil.

145
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:30,435
OK, you hold it between your thumb
and your first finger.

146
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,943
Very good. And you press lightly...
not too hard, OK?

147
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,649
Very good.

148
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,441
Good, we are continuing,
repeating after me.

149
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,782
A fatty,

150
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,492
a thinny.

151
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,873
A fatty,

152
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,911
a thinny.

153
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,545
A fatty,

154
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:56,207
a thinny.

155
00:18:56,385 --> 00:19:00,674
A fatty, a thinny...

156
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,134
Kamau, come here.

157
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,138
What's with the old man in uniform?

158
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,219
Yeah, he's in our school.

159
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,476
Get inside and start working.

160
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,477
Come on.

161
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,502
F-I-T.

162
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,918
A thinny.

163
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,671
F-I-T.

164
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,806
'Fit'.

165
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:33,097
F-I-T.

166
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,811
A thinny.

167
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,364
Maruge!

168
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,243
Maruge!

169
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,329
Stay out of the school, huh?

170
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,208
School is no place for an old man!

171
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,092
You don't belong there!

172
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,342
Get up. Get up.

173
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,930
Get into line!

174
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,352
Move!
Get out of the way!

175
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,437
Move out!

176
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,906
Where are they,
the Mau Mau?

177
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,078
Well done, Peter.

178
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:55,738
Makofi for Peter!

179
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,703
Well done, well done, Peter.

180
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:02,336
Try again another day. A wonderful boy!

181
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,792
OK, who's going to write for me
the number four?

182
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,253
The number four?
Who is going to write for me?

183
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:10,591
Suzanne. Suzanne, come.
Come and write for me the number four.

184
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,476
Well done, Suzanne.

185
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,602
Makofi for Suzanne, please.

186
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,480
Well done, well done, Suzanne!

187
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:26,064
Try again another day. A wonderful girl!

188
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,944
A wonderful girl! Very good.

189
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,697
OK, next after four is five.

190
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:33,109
Who is going to write the number five
for me?

191
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:35,994
Kamau, come and write
the number five for us.

192
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,701
Come.

193
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,377
Come and write the number five

194
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:46,710
so that we all know how to write
the number five.

195
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,881
Stop it!

196
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,765
Is that how we write the number five?

197
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,305
No.

198
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:03,973
No, it is not, Kamau.

199
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,687
I was just kidding.

200
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,647
OK. No more jokes.

201
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,413
Excellent! Very good, Kamau.

202
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,203
Makofi for Kamau, please.

203
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:29,374
Well done, well done, Kamau.

204
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:33,669
Try again another day. A wonderful boy.

205
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:37,635
OK, Maruge, can you come
and write for us the number six?

206
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:43,558
Maruge! Can you come
and write the number six for us?

207
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,394
Maruge!

208
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:49,435
Hey, stop.

209
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:57,118
Maruge, will you write the number six
for us?

210
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,495
OK, can someone else write me
the number six?

211
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,005
Who is going to write me
the number six?

212
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:50,522
Good morning, class.

213
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,855
Good morning, Teacher Alfred.

214
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:57,317
Teacher Alfred is going to inspect
for neatness, yes?

215
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,482
OK, sit down, sit down.

216
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,651
Thank you, Teacher.

217
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,655
Patrick, hm-hm. Good, good, good.

218
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,826
Pauline. Good.

219
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,664
Good.

220
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,503
Where is the date?

221
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,214
Good, good, good.

222
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,686
Maruge, your pencil's very blunt.

223
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,813
What kind of example are you setting?

224
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,225
Go sharpen it now
and don't let it happen again.

225
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,626
Malisa, Malisa, Malisa.

226
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,923
Should I help you
to hear a little bit better?

227
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,375
Like this, Maruge.

228
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,012
Maruge? Let's get you some air.

229
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,642
- What's wrong with him?
- Stay with my class.

230
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:34,349
It wasn't me!

231
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,523
What's wrong, Maruge?

232
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,954
I think this is all too much for you
at your age, Maruge.

233
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,959
Maybe you shouldn't be here.

234
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:01,250
It won't happen again.

235
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:05,626
What is that?

236
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,470
I was in the camps.

237
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,257
You were Mau Mau?

238
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:15,894
Yes.

239
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,940
Tell me what happened
in the classroom, Maruge.

240
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,773
Then I can help you.

241
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:29,195
I must go back to class
to finish my work.

242
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,708
I was a prisoner.

243
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:51,625
The British stole our land,

244
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,920
so we said they must give it back.

245
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,465
They told us to be quiet.

246
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,931
So we spoke very loud.

247
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,222
To some,

248
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,483
in 1963.

249
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,728
That was uhuru.

250
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,821
What does 'uhuru' mean?

251
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,368
It's 'freedom'.

252
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,080
Freedom!

253
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,623
Freedom!

254
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,587
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

255
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,298
- Uhuru!
- Uhuru!

256
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,087
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

257
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,630
- Uhuru!
- Uhuru!

258
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,390
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

259
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,926
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

260
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,093
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

261
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,136
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

262
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:46,680
- Uhuru!
- Uhuru!

263
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,893
- Uhuru!
- Uhuru!

264
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:49,353
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

265
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:50,893
- Uhuru!
- Uhuru!

266
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,699
What is this?

267
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:06,366
He's going to be a problem, for all of us.

268
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,087
Come on! Come outside
and start working.

269
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,581
Listen, my friend.

270
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,664
It doesn't have to be like this.

271
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:19,924
Renounce your oath
and you can go home.

272
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,304
Renounce the oath!

273
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,056
Again.

274
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,447
People, my people.

275
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:10,986
I'm hearing rumblings

276
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:15,248
<i>that an old man</i>
<i>has actually gone back to school.</i>

277
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,205
<i>An old man going back to school!</i>

278
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,494
Unbelievable.

279
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,754
Excellent work.

280
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:24,166
Come, Kamau.

281
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,461
Let's see what you have done.

282
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,129
Your one's very good.

283
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,797
Very good, very good.

284
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,216
Your fives again, Kamau.

285
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,976
Did we not go over this? Yes.

286
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,059
So why have you written them
the wrong way again?

287
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:40,599
Hm?

288
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:42,517
You have to write them again, Kamau.

289
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,061
- Sawa?
- Yes, Miss.

290
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,527
Maruge?

291
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,567
Excellent.

292
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,452
You are good with your numbers,
Maruge.

293
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:55,659
Excellent work.

294
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,701
Very good. I'm very happy with you.

295
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:03,212
Come, Francis.
Let's take a look at what you have done.

296
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:06,591
Oh, I like that.
Your work is always very neat.

297
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,717
You're a very clever boy.

298
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,674
OK. Excellent.

299
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,556
Because you have done so well,
you're going to get a star.

300
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,078
Ow! You're hurting me!

301
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:37,659
Ow!

302
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,578
Maruge!

303
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:46,714
You do not hit him!

304
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,552
<i>Honestly, ladies tell me</i>
<i>Kikuyus have mad blood,</i>

305
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,759
<i>but their back story's another one.</i>

306
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,470
<i>Kikuyus work like stallions.</i>
<i>They're very...</i>

307
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,260
Maruge, stop it! Maruge!

308
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,309
- Stop it!
- Hey!

309
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:05,975
Hey, hey, hey! What's going on here?

310
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,359
I couldn't believe my ears
when I got a phone call from the press

311
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,899
telling me about an old man
in one of my primary schools!

312
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,284
Who is he? Why is he
in school uniform?

313
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,197
His name is Maruge.

314
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,990
Mzee.

315
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,626
He wanted to come to school,
so I let him.

316
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,840
What do you mean?
This is a primary school.

317
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,597
Sir, the government said
everybody has the right to go to school.

318
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:40,977
Just because our politicians are stupid
doesn't mean we have to be as well!

319
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,728
He can't stay here.

320
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:45,641
Adults must go to the adult school.

321
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,854
Now, see to it that he leaves here now.

322
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:53,736
Sir, he fought the British.

323
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:57,494
- He was imprisoned in the camps.
- Oh, Mau Mau, huh?

324
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,996
Typical Kikuyu.
I should have known.

325
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,122
Excuse me?

326
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,999
I thought tribalism was over.

327
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,206
This has nothing to do with tribalism.

328
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,212
It's about doing
what's right for the school.

329
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:11,841
An old man like him does not belong
in a classroom full of children.

330
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,923
Now, we'll continue this conversation
in the office.

331
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,516
Maruge...

332
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:30,105
He's a bloody Kalenjin.

333
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,940
You too, Maruge?

334
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:35,403
You know, after independence,
we <i>all</i> became Kenyans.

335
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:36,941
The Kalenjins were loyalists!

336
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,361
So were my family loyal to the British!

337
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,905
So was everybody
if they wanted to stay alive!

338
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:46,201
And don't look at me like that.
The British never gave people a choice.

339
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,415
You were either for them
or you were against them,

340
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,500
and if you were against them,
they killed you.

341
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:53,917
I had children.

342
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,211
Two children!

343
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,217
I had a family!

344
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,808
The British killed them.

345
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:06,058
We chose.

346
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:09,099
The Kikuyus chose.

347
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:11,233
And we paid.

348
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,777
We paid!

349
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:33,415
Come to class. Come to class,
come to class, come to class.

350
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,918
Go to class, go to class.

351
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:03,111
He says I've got to get rid of Maruge.

352
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:06,247
He's sending him off to the adult school.

353
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,123
Where is his compassion?

354
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,125
<i>Jane, Jane, just stop.</i>

355
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:11,911
That's not what he's saying.

356
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,502
He's just saying Maruge cannot go
to children's school.

357
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,085
<i>Why are you defending him?</i>

358
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,548
The British killed his family.
We have a duty to help him.

359
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,634
The Mau Mau killed people too, OK?

360
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:25,801
But that's got nothing to do with an old
man going to a children's school.

361
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:26,967
<i>Fine.</i>

362
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,728
No-one's going to fight
for Maruge, so I will.

363
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:32,015
OK, please do not go over
Kipruto's head.

364
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:34,434
I work with these people
and I know how they are.

365
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,898
They won't take kindly to this.

366
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:38,734
You know I'm always on your side.

367
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,069
- Love you.
- 'Bye.

368
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,958
I appreciate your concern,
but my hands are tied.

369
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,620
Maruge is such a hard worker.

370
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:57,086
He's a great role model
for the children.

371
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,673
If we let Maruge in,
how can we refuse others?

372
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:03,008
Our schools could be flooded
with old people.

373
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,672
This would be taking away

374
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:07,513
from the precious resources
we need for our children.

375
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,020
Thank you for your time,
Madam Secretary.

376
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,603
You're welcome.

377
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:18,895
Mrs. Obinchu, one of the consultants
working with the Danish Government,

378
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,438
Charles Obinchu.

379
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,277
Charles is my husband.

380
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:25,193
- Give him my best.
- I will.

381
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:30,832
Mrs. Obinchu, the children
are Kenya's future.

382
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,687
I'm sorry, Maruge.

383
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,844
I have no money, no money.

384
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:35,388
There's nothing for free.

385
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,147
You cannot go, you're too old.

386
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:41,667
So today we're focusing
on singular and plural.

387
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:43,797
Let's start with 'bed', alright?

388
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:46,209
So, 'bed', the plural for 'bed' is 'beds'.

389
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:49,049
That's B-E-D-S.

390
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,134
Alright, so you just add an 'S'.

391
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,516
Alright, now, the plural for 'lamp'...

392
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:55,096
Please.

393
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:58,638
The plural for 'lamp'...

394
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,807
Alright, how about 'death'?

395
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:03,146
The plural for 'death'...

396
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:16,614
- Kwa heri!
- Asante!

397
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,157
See you later, Teacher.

398
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:19,997
Maruge, what are you
doing here?

399
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,127
Come inside.

400
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:26,007
I took the oath to get our land back
from the British.

401
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:30,136
Maruge, you don't have to
tell me this.

402
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:33,048
What is Kikuyu
without land?

403
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:36,433
The Masai, it's cattle.

404
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:38,890
But for us, it's land.

405
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:42,432
That's why
we were fighting.

406
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:47,482
But we are nothing if we cannot read.

407
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:50,022
We are useless.

408
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,205
When I was a boy,

409
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:00,662
there was no money for education.

410
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:04,878
I worked on a white man's farm.

411
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:10,297
Then came the fight for freedom.

412
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:12,424
Maruge...

413
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,054
I have a letter.

414
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,590
What do you mean?

415
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:18,805
That's why I came to the school.

416
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:22,346
I must read it for myself.

417
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:27,102
I have to understand.

418
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,816
Please.

419
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:34,275
Teach me to read, Mrs. Obinchu.

420
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:43,701
Well, I know we've had this conversation
many times before about Maruge,

421
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:47,042
but I was wondering if you might
be willing to reconsider.

422
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:49,753
Mr. Kipruto, they just mess around
at the adult school.

423
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,463
He didn't learn a thing.

424
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,262
Yes.

425
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,515
Yes, of course I'm grateful.

426
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:00,514
Kwa heri.

427
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:05,515
Maruge, I'm very sorry.
I've done everything...

428
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:07,729
That bloody Kipruto
can go to hell!

429
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,359
The adult school
is better than nothing...

430
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:10,940
I'm not going!

431
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:15,233
He's Kalenjin. His people were in bed
with the British.

432
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,197
Bloody loyalist!

433
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:20,204
I'm not going. Not me!

434
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,036
Let him go to the other school himself!

435
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:38,347
# A, B, C, D

436
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,132
# E, F, G, H

437
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:42,097
# I, J, K, L

438
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,719
# M, N, O, P

439
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,763
# Q, R, S, T... #

440
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,852
# U, V, W

441
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:51,690
# X, Y, zeddy, zeddy

442
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:53,775
# A, B, C, D

443
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,485
# E, F, G, H

444
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,445
# I, J, K, L

445
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,485
# M, N, O, P

446
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,278
# Q, R, S, T

447
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:03,163
# U, V, W

448
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:04,824
# X, Y, Z, zeddy

449
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,367
# X, Y, Z. #

450
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:12,757
Now, class, please sit down.

451
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:18,003
I came to say goodbye.

452
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:24,135
I told them a goat cannot read.

453
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:29,019
A goat cannot write his name.

454
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:35,021
They must study hard,
or they'll be like me...

455
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:39,488
an old man no better than that goat.

456
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:50,290
You know, goats are
very clever animals.

457
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,546
They never give up.

458
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:57,293
We can learn a very good lesson
from them.

459
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:06,427
Class, I have
an important announcement.

460
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:11,599
From now on, Maruge is going to be
my teaching assistant.

461
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:14,769
Well done, well done, Maruge.

462
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:16,357
I'm impressed.

463
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:18,739
How did you get them all
to behave so well?

464
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:24,449
I told them if they didn't behave,
I'll clobber them with my stick.

465
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,411
Maruge!

466
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:18,048
Wait a minute,
there's Mr. Maruge!

467
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,583
There's Mr. Maruge.

468
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:21,343
Mr. Maruge, Mr. Maruge.

469
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,763
Alright, alright!

470
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:32,850
Please, please, if we're going to do this,
let us at least do it in an orderly way.

471
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:36,483
If you want to speak to Maruge,
one question at a time.

472
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:38,019
His hearing is poor. Please.

473
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:39,562
Mr. Maruge, CNN Washington.

474
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,197
Mr. Maruge, why didn't you go to school
when you were younger?

475
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:45,280
There was no free education for
black people when Maruge was a boy.

476
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:47,285
What is the motivation now?

477
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:01,004
What did he say?

478
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,386
He says, "The power is in the pen."

479
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:09,592
To read and understand,
it's very important.

480
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:13,228
This is one way of finishing poverty
among us.

481
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,268
And the Bible... I don't trust
those preachers in the churches.

482
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:19,309
Who does?

483
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:20,853
Mr. Maruge, BBC London.

484
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:24,148
Is the Kenyan Government doing
enough for education in this country?

485
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:27,568
Yes, yes... free education! For all.

486
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,577
Mr. Maruge, NTV Nairobi.

487
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:34,992
Do you think this is right?

488
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:38,287
She's just drawing attention to herself
and the school.

489
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,126
It's not right for anybody.

490
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,756
Alfred.

491
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:45,086
Hey?

492
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:48,051
You are the most negative person
I know.

493
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,716
This is a good thing for the school.
Just relax.

494
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:59,309
<i>People, the world has gone</i>
<i>absolutely mad.</i>

495
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:02,603
And look, 'New York Times',
'L.A. Times', 'Kenya Times',

496
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:03,896
all the 'Times',

497
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,110
<i>BBC, 'Daily Telegraph'.</i>

498
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:10,073
<i>The world is finally talking,</i>
<i>"Maruge, Maruge!"</i>

499
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:14,832
<i>And not to forget the teacher</i>
<i>who took Maruge to school at 84 years.</i>

500
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:16,788
It's absolutely crazy!

501
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:21,752
<i>Now, this mzee was once</i>
<i>a Mau Mau veteran, war fighter,</i>

502
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,461
<i>who wanted Kenya to say...</i>

503
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:27,670
'Can'.

504
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:31,261
<i>Now, despite his age,</i>
<i>he too is demanding free education</i>

505
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:35,348
<i>and head teacher Jane Obinchu</i>
<i>has welcomed him through the doors.</i>

506
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:36,887
<i>Many parents are outraged</i>

507
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,852
<i>and feel that such a valuable place</i>
<i>should not be wasted</i>

508
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,733
<i>on such an old man.</i>

509
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:43,940
<i>And, as feelings run increasingly high,</i>

510
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:47,356
<i>this controversy is no doubt set to grow.</i>

511
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:58,204
Habari yako?

512
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:05,045
You don't care about our children.
You only care about yourself.

513
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:06,584
You want your face in the newspapers

514
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:08,468
so that you can fill your pockets
with money.

515
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,425
How dare you say that to me!

516
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:13,966
Every single child is important to me,
including your son.

517
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,806
- Habari yako, Polo?
- Mzuri.

518
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:38,119
Mau Mau... have you seen? The title?

519
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,033
Have you seen that?
Have you seen the title?

520
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:44,542
84 years. 84! 84 years.

521
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,206
Gone back to school.

522
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:47,750
- How old are you?
- 55.

523
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:49,338
55. You are a toddler.

524
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:06,102
I don't want my son
being mixed with old men!

525
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,861
OK, everybody, please.

526
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,943
I know that you are all upset.

527
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:14,326
Please, would you listen to me?

528
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:17,533
I think that we have a lot to learn
from Maruge.

529
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:20,245
He's helping us.

530
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:24,207
OK? The children have a lot
that they can learn from the old.

531
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,793
I don't want him to teach my son, huh?

532
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:28,673
Who is he? Who is he?

533
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:30,835
Where is the teachers?

534
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:50,695
Now look at this. Surely.

535
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:04,368
What do you think you're doing?
You're running a circus!

536
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,502
I told you to get rid of
that old man.

537
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,914
You know what, Mr. Kipruto?
Why don't you just come clean?

538
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,799
Is it because Maruge is old
or is it because he's Kikuyu

539
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,551
that you don't want him here?

540
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:16,179
This is not about tribes,
Mrs. Obinchu!

541
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,841
Who do you think you are,
dictating the agenda?

542
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:21,761
You're an employee.
You do as I tell you.

543
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:24,897
Now, I'm warning you one last time.
He goes to the adult school!

544
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:29,777
He's got no money, Mr. Kipruto.
He can't go to school anywhere else.

545
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,903
He will have money soon.

546
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:35,612
This Kikuyu government is going to give
the Mau Mau compensation money.

547
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:37,742
Compensation for what?
For killing their own people?

548
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:39,653
Mr. Kipruto...

549
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:44,825
...can't we just put the past behind us?

550
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:48,086
The past is always present,
Mrs. Obinchu.

551
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:50,747
Never forget that.

552
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:13,668
Maruge.

553
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:52,165
Ask her.
Ask her, is this her husband?

554
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,957
Ask her, Kikuyu?

555
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:12,681
Take the child off her.

556
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:16,689
Take this baby off her.

557
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,478
Hey, Kamau.

558
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:02,332
Look. Look at his grades.

559
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:03,875
He can't keep up with the others.

560
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:05,544
Meaning that my son
is stupid?

561
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,633
I'm not saying that your son
is stupid, Mr. Chege.

562
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,297
All I'm saying is that
in our school

563
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:11,637
there's a certain level of attainment
that he needs to achieve

564
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,517
in order to move on to the next class.

565
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:16,100
Otherwise, he repeats the same class
or goes to special school.

566
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,395
My son has a right
for free education!

567
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:24,938
Do I make
myself clear?

568
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:26,481
I understand perfectly,
Mr. Chege.

569
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,150
We're helping him
in every way we can.

570
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:29,693
You are not
helping him! Huh?!

571
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:32,578
You're busy wasting your time
with that stupid old man.

572
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,114
Look, I'm running
a shop, huh?

573
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:36,874
And my son must be extremely good
in mathematics and science.

574
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:45,629
This is not fair and this is not right!

575
01:02:45,804 --> 01:02:47,169
Mr. Chege, I...

576
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:50,384
We'll deal with this
when you get home.

577
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:05,483
Well, I guess we know he can dance.
How's he getting on in the classroom?

578
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:08,364
His maths is good,
but he really came here to read,

579
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:09,900
and it needs a lot more work.

580
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:13,036
It's about finding time
for everyone.

581
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:15,618
Come, come, come. Back to class!

582
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,498
Let's go to class.

583
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:20,877
OK, Maruge, sound this for me.

584
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,962
- And put it together...
- 'Sat'.

585
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:29,503
Wonderful! Very good.

586
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:31,046
'Bat'.

587
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:34,512
Well done, Maruge.
That is very good, very good.

588
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:36,768
OK, let's move on to the next one.

589
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:41,932
- Together?
- 'Cat'.

590
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:45,398
Excellent, Maruge.
Very good.

591
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:47,520
Kamau?

592
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:51,157
We are working here.
Please go away.

593
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:54,365
School is over. Please go home.

594
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:57,489
Come, come.

595
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:02,168
'Mat'.

596
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:04,250
Oh, Maruge,
you have done so well.

597
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:05,789
Very good!

598
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,582
OK, let's go over our sounds

599
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:10,628
and then we'll finish there
for today, OK?

600
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:14,218
'Ah', 'buh', 'kuh', 'duh'...

601
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,703
- Hello?
- <i>Jane Obinchu?</i>

602
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,246
Yes?

603
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:49,131
<i>So now you are giving private lessons</i>
<i>to the old man, eh?</i>

604
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,252
Who is this?

605
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,591
<i>We are watching you.</i>

606
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:58,133
<i>We know you are alone in that house.</i>

607
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,802
<i>You'll want to take care.</i>

608
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:16,568
Walalaa! Hoo, hoo, hoo.
Wa wa wa wa!

609
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,362
Now, that's called money on wheels...
mobile money.

610
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:21,702
Politicians... what do they want now?

611
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:24,458
When I grow up,
that's the kind of car I'd like to drive,

612
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:26,085
but not as a politician.

613
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:36,633
# Welcome, everybody

614
01:05:36,808 --> 01:05:38,673
# It's good to see you here

615
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:40,934
# Welcome, everybody

616
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:43,140
# It's good to see you here

617
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:47,432
# Welcome here today

618
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,100
# Welcome, everybody

619
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:50,894
# It's good to see you here... #

620
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:52,812
Welcome. We are honoured
to have you here.

621
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:54,822
- Greetings from Nairobi.
- Asante.

622
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:57,234
- How are the kids?
- Very good, very good.

623
01:05:57,412 --> 01:05:59,027
# It's good to see you here... #

624
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:02,072
This is wonderful! You have put us
on the map, Mrs. Obinchu.

625
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,707
- And we are very grateful.
- Asante.

626
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:08,336
No water, no electricity
and right in the middle of nowhere.

627
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:11,043
David, bring the sweets.

628
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,754
Mr. Maruge, nice to meet you.

629
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,634
- Nice to meet you.
- Asante.

630
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,261
You are doing us proud.

631
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:19,093
Hello, you young ones!

632
01:06:19,267 --> 01:06:20,256
Mrs. Obinchu?

633
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:22,676
Can we talk?

634
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:24,344
Yes, of course.

635
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,521
So what is our cut?

636
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:28,852
Excuse me?

637
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:32,440
Look, don't act stupid with me, bitch.

638
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:34,570
The press are giving you money
for Maruge.

639
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:36,277
I want my share.

640
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:39,318
# It's good to see you here

641
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,282
# Welcome, everybody

642
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:43,367
# It's good to see you here

643
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,202
# Welcome, everybody... #

644
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:48,038
I've got politicians turning up
at school.

645
01:06:48,213 --> 01:06:51,205
One of their aides thinks the press
are giving me money for Maruge.

646
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:53,373
He threatened me.

647
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:54,916
<i>What did you say to him?</i>

648
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,506
- I told him to leave.
- <i>Oh, Jane.</i>

649
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,045
You must be careful.

650
01:06:59,224 --> 01:07:00,839
You're butting heads
with powerful people.

651
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,882
What did you expect me to do, Charles?

652
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:05,598
<i>You should be in Nairobi with me.</i>

653
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:08,388
I can't protect you
when you're there.

654
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:11,645
OK.

655
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:14,185
I'm coming home.

656
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:16,195
I'll cancel my meetings for tomorrow.

657
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:18,527
<i>Thank you.</i>

658
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,237
Charles?

659
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:23,654
I'm sorry.

660
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,287
I love you.

661
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,994
OK.

662
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:08,702
Yes?

663
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:10,832
<i>Charles Obinchu?</i>

664
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:14,212
Yes. Hold on a minute.

665
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:25,014
Yes?

666
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:28,301
<i>Do you know how your wife spends</i>
<i>her evenings when you're not there?</i>

667
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,937
<i>Maybe you don't mind</i>
<i>if she has a boyfriend, eh?</i>

668
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:35,326
We know those newspaper people
gave you some money.

669
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:38,000
We want a share.

670
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,914
What money?

671
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:41,674
I have no money.

672
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,631
- Old man...
- Leave me alone!

673
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:10,533
Go to the school and
teach Maruge a lesson.

674
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,411
Make sure and make no mistake.

675
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:18,544
Scare him away from here for good.

676
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:21,127
No mistakes!

677
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:25,255
You don't hurt the children. Am I clear?

678
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:27,637
- Yes.
- Today we are doing it.

679
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:29,422
Yes!

680
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,388
Who are the lions on my team?

681
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:36,396
Yes! Who are the elephants
on Maruge's team?

682
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:42,315
OK, are you ready?
Are you set? Let's go!

683
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:43,898
OK, quick, so we can beat...

684
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:57,291
Get away from the window!
Get away from the window!

685
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:03,631
Sit down, everybody. Sit down!
Francis! Get away from the window!

686
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:05,666
Get away! Get down!

687
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,757
What's going on here?

688
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,110
You think you can
do anything to me?

689
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,571
What can you do?
What can you do?

690
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:38,783
Let's go, let's go. The old bull is crazy.
Let's go, let's go!

691
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,326
Leave him! Leave him!

692
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:48,084
Let's go, man. Let's go!

693
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:52,004
- Go away!
- Stay there, Kamau.

694
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,685
You can do nothing.

695
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:12,699
This is getting out of hand, Maruge.

696
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:15,282
We are alright. It's nothing wrong.

697
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:17,071
They won't come back.

698
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:26,248
I'm OK. I'm alright. Just a few people
I've just annoyed. It's OK.

699
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:48,520
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

700
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,575
"Long neck,

701
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:56,986
"tummy fat,

702
01:12:57,164 --> 01:13:01,328
"number 5 wears a hat."

703
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,793
Can you imagine that, Kamau?

704
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:07,956
A man with a long neck

705
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:11,001
and a big tummy, fat,

706
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:13,294
and wears a hat!

707
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:17,257
"Long neck,

708
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:19,266
"tummy fat,

709
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:22,053
"number 5 wears a hat."

710
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:25,598
Good. Now I want you to try it.

711
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:27,858
"Long neck,

712
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:31,021
"tummy fat...

713
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:36,280
"...number 5 wears a hat."

714
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:38,991
Very good, Kamau. Very good!

715
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:42,157
Want to try it again?
Yeah, good.

716
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:45,452
"Long neck...

717
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:49,163
"...tummy fat,

718
01:13:49,342 --> 01:13:53,005
"number 5 wears a hat."

719
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:55,044
Great!

720
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:56,883
You sure you can do it?

721
01:13:57,058 --> 01:13:59,014
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

722
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:01,016
Yes, I know you can!

723
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:02,518
And I knew you could!

724
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,224
Yes.

725
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:36,127
- For me?
- Yes.

726
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,045
Thanks, Jonas.

727
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,942
- I can't believe this.
- Hmm?

728
01:14:56,117 --> 01:14:58,654
He's transferred me.

729
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:01,114
What? Where to?

730
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:04,030
Turkana is 300 miles away from here.

731
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:06,369
How are we supposed
to see each other?

732
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:09,707
You're not taking that transfer,
and that's clear.

733
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,417
Well, I'm not resigning, Charles.

734
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:15,503
I refuse to give Kipruto the satisfaction
as a matter of principle.

735
01:15:15,678 --> 01:15:17,043
To hell with principle!

736
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:19,428
They are throwing bloody rocks
at the classroom.

737
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:21,759
They transfer you.
I'm having problems at work.

738
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:23,845
Can't you see what this thing
is doing to us?

739
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,885
So, what do you want me
to do, Charles? Hmm?

740
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:29,021
Go quietly and shut up,
like a good Kenyan woman?

741
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:31,398
"Women must be seen
and not heard," is that it?

742
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:33,855
You are seen, trust me.

743
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,770
You are seen!

744
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:47,578
Seen?

745
01:15:49,336 --> 01:15:51,372
Are you accusing me of something?

746
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:56,874
Jane,

747
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,135
people are beginning to talk.

748
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:04,766
I get phone calls day and night,
telling me things.

749
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:07,722
That you're having an affair.

750
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:10,559
Are you?

751
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:14,900
Are you having an affair?

752
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:20,443
How low can they go?

753
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:24,448
How far are you willing
to take this, Jane?

754
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:28,035
Why are you risking everything
because of this old man?

755
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,746
Just let it go.

756
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:33,627
Let it go.

757
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,710
You know what the simple
answer is, Charles?

758
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:46,095
I just don't have any way
to turn him away.

759
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:52,559
I'll go to Turkana.

760
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:55,937
But I'm not resigning.

761
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:59,566
I'm not giving in to them.

762
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:21,505
- Karibu.
- Asante.

763
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,253
Tell me your mind.

764
01:17:27,518 --> 01:17:29,304
I go with you to Turkana.

765
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:31,810
I'll go to school there.

766
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:33,972
No, thanks, Maruge.

767
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,311
I don't want any more battles.

768
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:39,101
Turkana is far.

769
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,191
What about your husband?

770
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:44,152
He'll stay in Nairobi.

771
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:46,567
He's very busy.

772
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:50,203
We've been apart so much
we're used to it, yeah?

773
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:53,995
You're suffering because of me.

774
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,580
No.

775
01:17:55,754 --> 01:17:57,290
It's my decision.

776
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:03,167
I think I'm too old to learn.

777
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:08,555
My father had a saying.

778
01:18:08,726 --> 01:18:10,887
He wasn't an educated man.

779
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:13,017
He was a fisherman.

780
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:15,475
But he said,

781
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:20,393
"Learning never ends until
you have got soil in your ears."

782
01:18:22,448 --> 01:18:24,689
What was your father's tribe?

783
01:18:24,867 --> 01:18:26,823
Kisii.

784
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:31,453
From the lakes.

785
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:33,160
Good people.

786
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:43,253
Wow!

787
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:45,509
That was a long time ago!

788
01:18:47,431 --> 01:18:49,422
A handsome man, Maruge!

789
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:54,893
And your wife, she's very beautiful.

790
01:18:57,316 --> 01:18:58,852
Yes.

791
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,273
Thank you for the tea, Maruge.

792
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:13,613
I will see you tomorrow for my last day.

793
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:24,089
You know, my mother
never went to school.

794
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:26,545
But she said to me,

795
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:30,963
"Jane, you must love education,

796
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:34,053
"because I want you
to be better than me."

797
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:36,935
Now, I am your mother,

798
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:40,815
and I am telling you all

799
01:19:40,985 --> 01:19:44,819
you must love education...

800
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,105
...so that you can be better than me

801
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:51,447
and all of us teachers here.

802
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:54,032
- Si ndiyo?
- Ndiyo.

803
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:56,037
Good.

804
01:19:57,251 --> 01:20:00,209
Some of us have bought gifts
for Teacher Jane.

805
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:03,162
Can I see them?

806
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:12,721
OK, Faith. Would you like to start us off?

807
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:33,655
Oh!

808
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:45,875
A bracelet! Thank you so much.

809
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:48,336
These are just for you, Teacher Jane.

810
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:53,546
Have you seen Maruge?

811
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:56,716
No, I haven't seen him.

812
01:21:36,683 --> 01:21:39,925
- Good morning, children.
- Good morning, sir.

813
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:41,810
Children, I am Mr. Kipruto,

814
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:45,472
and I'm pleased to announce the
appointment of the new head teacher,

815
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:49,269
the new mwalimu mkuu,
who will take the place of Teacher Jane.

816
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:53,655
The new head teacher has shown
loyalty and dedication

817
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:55,407
to the education of children

818
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:58,569
and we feel is greatly deserving
of this promotion.

819
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:05,584
I expect you to show your full support
for Mrs. Grace Muthumba.

820
01:22:06,713 --> 01:22:08,453
She'll be joining us this afternoon.

821
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:12,045
So in the meantime,
I'll be standing in her place.

822
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:17,009
I used to be a teacher.
So we'll have fun, right?

823
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:18,262
Yes.

824
01:22:19,518 --> 01:22:25,388
Alright, children. And then you've got
class. And then you've got class.

825
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:28,729
No running! No running, no running,
no running, no running.

826
01:22:29,987 --> 01:22:31,523
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

827
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:43,329
I need to go to the city.

828
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,865
You're going to the city? Let's go.

829
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:47,034
- That's my fare.
- What?

830
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:50,124
What am I going to do
with a goat, Maruge?

831
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:51,664
You can breed more goats.

832
01:22:51,842 --> 01:22:54,629
- Oh, come on, Maruge.
- I've got to get to the city quickly.

833
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:58,421
That's not fair. Maruge, next time
you need to get hard cash.

834
01:22:58,599 --> 01:23:01,591
Free education is
messing you up, Maruge.

835
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:16,355
She's here!

836
01:23:26,251 --> 01:23:29,243
Hello! So many faces.

837
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:02,029
Come on.

838
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:15,296
You get the padlock.

839
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:17,298
Faster, faster, faster.

840
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:19,676
Move back!

841
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:26,884
Go back. Go back, go back.

842
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:56,796
OK, throw. Throw!

843
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:04,880
We want Teacher Jane!
We want Teacher Jane!

844
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:08,721
We want Teacher Jane!
We want Teacher Jane!

845
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:26,447
Teacher Jane!

846
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:29,580
Maruge, your damn goat
is peeing on everyone here!

847
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:32,662
Hey, what's that? You're an idiot
for going back to school.

848
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:34,792
This celebrity culture
has gone too far now!

849
01:25:48,185 --> 01:25:49,675
You, stop that, now.

850
01:25:49,853 --> 01:25:53,345
No! Look at them! I can't
handle such indiscipline!

851
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:55,730
They're just... little children!
They're just little...

852
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:57,266
Hey, we can take care of them!

853
01:25:57,444 --> 01:26:00,607
- No!
- Grace, please!

854
01:26:00,781 --> 01:26:02,442
They're just little kids!

855
01:26:02,616 --> 01:26:08,953
We want Teacher Jane!
We want Teacher Jane!

856
01:26:15,962 --> 01:26:16,997
Sorry!

857
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:20,084
Grace!

858
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:22,666
Grace!

859
01:26:34,815 --> 01:26:37,852
Wow, karibu!
This is where everybody is.

860
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:39,766
But don't worry, we have
a better place, alright?

861
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:43,153
There's no demonstration. So many
people are doing their business, Maruge.

862
01:26:43,323 --> 01:26:44,813
Watch out, watch out!

863
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:47,983
When you get lost here,
just raise your ID.

864
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:50,823
Wah-wah! Nairobi, here we come.

865
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:52,533
This is Nairobi!

866
01:27:27,284 --> 01:27:29,570
Got the old guy
from the education campaign

867
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:31,406
here with me in reception.

868
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:33,366
He wants to see the chairman.

869
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:35,451
OK, thanks.

870
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:39,117
Excuse me. The chairman is busy.

871
01:27:39,296 --> 01:27:41,537
Would you like to see
the deputy chairman?

872
01:27:41,715 --> 01:27:43,671
- No.
- Oh... alright.

873
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:45,207
Then I'm afraid you'll have to wait.

874
01:27:45,385 --> 01:27:46,921
I don't want to wait.

875
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:48,585
You're gonna have to.

876
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:51,762
Hey, Jacquie, I need the chairman
to sign this.

877
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:55,391
No, sorry, he's in a meeting
and I cannot disturb him.

878
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:57,177
But I need it right now.

879
01:27:57,355 --> 01:28:00,267
OK, do this... leave it with me,
then I'll see what I can do.

880
01:28:00,442 --> 01:28:02,728
- OK, but make it ASAP.
- Sure.

881
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:12,825
Hey, sir! Wait! Please wait!

882
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:16,955
So, where do we go from here?

883
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:19,537
Mr. Chairman, I still insist
that we should go to Kilifi.

884
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:26,999
We have the money!

885
01:28:27,177 --> 01:28:29,088
Wait, sir!

886
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:31,127
Old man, you can't go in...

887
01:28:33,517 --> 01:28:35,599
I am so sorry, Mr. Chairman.

888
01:28:35,769 --> 01:28:37,134
I'm gonna go and call security.

889
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:39,098
What is this?

890
01:28:39,272 --> 01:28:41,888
Sir, this is Mzee Maruge.

891
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:45,104
Mr. Maruge.
What can we do for you?

892
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:47,143
I'm here for a teacher.

893
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:49,904
- Sir, shall I...
- No, that's alright. Thank you.

894
01:28:51,076 --> 01:28:53,112
You have our attention, sir.

895
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:57,620
I was in the detention camps
with our founding fathers.

896
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:03,668
These men sacrificed everything
for your generation.

897
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:06,501
Without them, you'd not be here.

898
01:29:07,551 --> 01:29:10,588
Before, it was only
the Queen's face there.

899
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:55,045
The British did this to me.

900
01:29:56,725 --> 01:29:58,716
They cracked my skull.

901
01:30:02,105 --> 01:30:04,346
They chopped off my toes.

902
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:06,185
Mr. Chairman...

903
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:10,728
Mr. Maruge, that's enough.

904
01:30:17,203 --> 01:30:19,945
We have to learn
from our past.

905
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:22,114
We must not forget.

906
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:24,829
But we must be better.

907
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:29,958
We need good teachers.

908
01:30:31,343 --> 01:30:35,086
We reap what we sow with our children.

909
01:30:38,308 --> 01:30:40,139
Bring her back.

910
01:30:50,946 --> 01:30:52,527
Thank you.

911
01:32:44,768 --> 01:32:46,804
Welcome back.

912
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:06,445
- Who is it?
- It's Teacher Jane!

913
01:33:06,623 --> 01:33:10,081
Teacher! Teacher Jane is here.
Can we go to her?

914
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:28,384
Welcome back!

915
01:33:28,561 --> 01:33:30,677
Oh, we missed you so much.

916
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:32,516
Welcome!

917
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:40,649
Welcome back!

918
01:33:55,421 --> 01:33:57,377
Ohh!

919
01:34:03,972 --> 01:34:07,430
I hear you have been writing.
Is it true you have been writing?

920
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,057
Alright, back to class! OK, come.

921
01:34:10,228 --> 01:34:14,938
Let's go back to class.

922
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:24,773
I hope you're back for good.

923
01:34:26,244 --> 01:34:27,950
OK, so let's decide
which books are going...

924
01:34:28,121 --> 01:34:30,328
Yes, Maruge?

925
01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:32,705
- We're busy, Maruge.
- No, it's OK.

926
01:34:32,876 --> 01:34:38,371
The letter. 'Tis too hard.
You must read it for me now.

927
01:34:38,548 --> 01:34:40,254
Please.

928
01:34:44,137 --> 01:34:45,673
Come, Maruge.

929
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:09,783
You read it for Maruge.

930
01:35:12,832 --> 01:35:14,538
Sit down, Maruge.

931
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:31,052
"Dear honoured prisoner number 4339,

932
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:34,218
"On behalf of the Republic of Kenya

933
01:35:34,395 --> 01:35:38,604
"I would like to inform you that you have

01:35:38,775 --> 01:35:44,611

938
01:36:00,088 --> 01:36:04,752

939
01:36:18,606 --> 01:36:22,599

"His Excellency, the President

944
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:56,466
We're here because of you, Maruge.

945
01:37:05,278 --> 01:37:06,893
Shall we go, Maruge?

946
01:37:13,453 --> 01:37:15,535
This is not the end, you know?

947
01:37:15,705 --> 01:37:17,787
I want to continue learning.

948
01:37:17,957 --> 01:37:20,323
I want to become a vet.

949
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:23,163
A vet, Maruge?

950
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:25,829
But you know you'll be
about 100 years old?

951
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:28,965
I'll learn until I have
soil in my ears.

952
01:37:29,135 --> 01:37:32,844
Yes, Maruge. You will. You will.

953
01:39:01,477 --> 01:39:03,809
My people, my people,

954
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:06,141
teacher, my teacher, wow!

955
01:39:06,315 --> 01:39:09,307
Now, word has spread, officially,

956
01:39:09,485 --> 01:39:13,819
that Kimani Ng'ang'a Maruge
has actually made it all the way

957
01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:17,482
to the United States of America
all by himself,

958
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:21,073
speaking to the UN,
to talk to the politicians.

959
01:39:21,247 --> 01:39:23,454
This is unbelievable!

960
01:39:23,624 --> 01:39:25,990
I... I cannot even...

961
01:39:26,169 --> 01:39:29,707
Maruge in the United States,
speaking to the UN!

962
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:31,496
Can you... Can you believe that?

963
01:39:31,674 --> 01:39:35,633
You know, I'm now...
I'm now beginning to believe

964
01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:40,263
that one day, a Kenyan...
a Kenyan! ...will go to the White House.

965
01:39:40,433 --> 01:39:43,470
But for now...
...according to me,

966
01:39:43,644 --> 01:39:48,013
Kimani Maruge is
the headmaster of the world!

967
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:49,727
Yes, we can!
