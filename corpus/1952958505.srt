1
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,518
(Eunice) R-E-T-Z-N.

2
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,153
(machine clicking)

3
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,878
(Tom) And the next set?

4
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,431
(Eunice) Z-H-O-T-N-X.

5
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,279
X-O-T,

6
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,350
F-D-E.

7
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,032
And the next set?

8
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,398
R-E-D,

9
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,831
O-Z-F.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,274
Okay.

11
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,871
Uh, Eunice.

12
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,949
How many of those letters
can you actually see

13
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,519
and how many have you memorised?

14
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,716
I can see all of them, Dr Avery.

15
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,114
Eunice...

16
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,638
Okay. I memorised the last two, Tom.
Only the last two.

17
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,398
If I can't get my license renewed...

18
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,199
Eunice, you need to wear
the lenses I prescribed.

19
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,039
Contact lenses don't work for me
and glasses give me headaches.

20
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,559
Then we'll change the prescription,

21
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,438
but you know the DMV's gonna
test you again anyway.

22
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,591
I've memorised those charts, too.

23
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,591
(Doreen) Mrs. Conrad called and cancelled
her appointment for tomorrow.

24
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,474
Bill Warren wants to know if he can
see you before he goes in for work,

25
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,915
which means you have to be here
at 8:00 a.m.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,513
- Okay.
- Okay for 8:00?

27
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,874
- Yeah.
- Oh.

28
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,030
Roger called while you were in
with a patient.

29
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,919
He said if you miss the 2:00 tee time,
you pay for the beer.

30
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,792
I pay for the beer anyway.

31
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,436
And Daniel called and left a message
here on the voicemail last night.

32
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,352
- What'd he say?
- He said he'll call back.

33
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,749
He said he's somewhere in France
and he sounded good.

34
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,796
I mean, how do you not sound good
if you're in France, right?

35
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,233
Did he leave a number this time?

36
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,314
No.

37
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,759
Everyone on the planet has
a mobile phone except my son.

38
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,991
What the hell's the matter
with that kid?

39
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,470
The world on Daniel's terms.

40
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,232
- See you.
- (phone ringing)

41
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,312
Oh, no!

42
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,033
- (chuckling)
- (groaning)

43
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,639
Let me show you
how a real doctor does it.

44
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,756
Since when is Tom
not a real doctor, Rog?

45
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,638
The eyes are the most important organ
in the body, Roger.

46
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,439
- (chuckles) Maybe at your age, Tom.
- They're the windows to the soul.

47
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,636
Yeah? How the hell would Roger know?
He doesn't have one.

48
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,319
(chuckling)

49
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,559
(Cal) Oh... (chuckles)

50
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,676
(Phil) Looks like malpractice
to me, boys.

51
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,991
- Don't use your foot wedge, Phil!
- I got your foot wedge, Roger.

52
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,639
All right, what do we got, about 70?

53
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,438
Yeah, plus 10 to the flag.

54
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,515
That's what I'm talking about.
You like that?

55
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,033
- It'll play.
- That's good stuff.

56
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,553
I'm over there.

57
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,949
Yeah, I see. It's about three feet away.
You want a ride or what?

58
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,678
I'm old and tired.

59
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,228
- You're old and lazy.
- I don't see you walking this course.

60
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,273
(mobile ringing)

61
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,437
It's mine and it can wait.

62
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,034
Get... (exclaiming)

63
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,439
(Phil) Nice chip.
(Roger) Not bad.

64
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,556
Go ahead and putt out.
I'll catch up with you. Hello?

65
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,039
(man speaking French)

66
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,394
Yes, hello?

67
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,675
(man inquiring in French)

68
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,472
I'm sorry. I don't speak French.

69
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,632
I am Captain Henri Sebastian
of the National Gendarmerie

70
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,716
in Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port in France.

71
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,469
- Is something wrong?
- Are you the father of Daniel Avery?

72
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,232
Yes, I am.

73
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,597
I'm sorry to inform you
that your son has been killed, sir.

74
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,233
What?

75
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,919
What do you mean?

76
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,713
Daniel? Something happened to Daniel?

77
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,831
He was caught in a storm

78
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,951
on the Camino de Santiago, monsieur.

79
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,433
I don't even know where that is.

80
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,158
It's in the French Pyrenees.

81
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,958
He was on pilgrimage.

82
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,833
Tom?

83
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,759
Tommy?

84
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,719
Where you going?

85
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,519
Tommy?

86
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,350
(Father Sandoval)
I'm sorry for your loss, Tom.

87
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,393
Thanks, Father.

88
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,593
I'm going overseas to bring Daniel home.

89
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,671
Would you like to pray with me, Tom?

90
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,798
What for?

91
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,198
All the information
for your itinerary is in here.

92
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,354
I cancelled all your appointments
for next week, so...

93
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,959
He wanted to see the world.

94
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,159
And he did.

95
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,308
(Daniel) You should fly with me.
(Tom) What?

96
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,431
- You should fly with me.
- Yeah, right.

97
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,476
Turn the car around. Pack a bag.

98
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,190
Grab your passport.
Forget your golf clubs.

99
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,871
Come on, a father-son trip.
It'll be fun.

100
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,079
When you coming back?

101
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,593
I don't know.

102
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,713
So you don't have a plan.

103
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,956
We agreed that if I let you
take me to the airport,

104
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,474
you wouldn't lecture me about
how I'm ruining my life.

105
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,232
I lied.

106
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,319
You know, most people don't have
the luxury of just picking up

107
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,998
and leaving it all behind, Daniel.

108
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,752
Well, I'm not most people.

109
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,717
If I don't have your blessing,
that's fine.

110
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,071
But don't judge this. Don't judge me.

111
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,790
My life here might not seem
like much to you,

112
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,478
but it's the life I choose.

113
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,471
You don't choose a life, Dad.

114
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,839
You live one.

115
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,234
(man announcing on speaker in French)

116
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,870
(people chattering)

117
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,596
- Mr. Avery?
- Yes.

118
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,238
We spoke on the phone.

119
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,868
- Captain Henri Sebastian.
- Of course.

120
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,438
I don't know why, I know it's odd, but
I thought it would say something else.

121
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,355
It's the same word back home.
I guess I thought it would be different.

122
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,715
Mr. Avery, if you are not ready
to do this,

123
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,279
- it can wait.
- No.

124
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,671
It's fine. I mean, it's not fine.
I mean, I'm okay.

125
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,789
Let's get it over with.
Let's just get it over with.

126
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,838
(zipper closing)

127
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,035
These are Daniel's belongings.

128
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,834
(thanking in French)

129
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,157
This is everything he had
when we found him.

130
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,833
- What happened?
- It was an accident.

131
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,838
The weather in the Pyrenees is famous
for being unpredictable

132
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,389
and I'm sure Daniel would have been
warned by the locals.

133
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,632
You were not close with him?

134
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,313
Not since his mother died,
I'm sorry to say.

135
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,837
What was he doing out there?

136
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,758
He was on pilgrimage on the Camino.

137
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,320
Walking the road
to Santiago de Compostela.

138
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,750
People from very different backgrounds,
faiths and generations

139
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,798
have walked the path from here
in the French Pyrenees

140
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,632
to Santiago de Compostela,

141
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,718
800 kilometers
on the north-western coast of Spain,

142
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,791
for over a thousand years.

143
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,952
We believers are told
that the remains of St James,

144
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,713
the apostle of Jesus,
are interred there.

145
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,517
And so we make pilgrimage.

146
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,310
This is what your son Daniel was doing.

147
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,639
Why he was alone?

148
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,594
(Henri) Many people choose
to make the trek alone.

149
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,831
The Way is a very personal journey,
Mr. Avery.

150
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,632
This is the shell.

151
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,320
The symbol of the pilgrim
making the journey.

152
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,633
And this...

153
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,999
This is Daniel's passport
for the Camino.

154
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,753
It is to be officially stamped

155
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,593
at every important stop
along the route through Spain.

156
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,553
And the first stamp is here,
in Saint-Jean.

157
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,954
(agent) Buen Camino.

158
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,314
(thanking in French)

159
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,677
(Henri) When you arrive at the end,

160
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,239
the passport should look like this.

161
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,479
I have walked the Camino
to the Atlantic Ocean three times.

162
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,637
There and back.

163
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,394
I will do it once more,
on my 70th birthday.

164
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,112
God willing, of course.

165
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,190
Daniel was my only child.

166
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,271
We can also offer cremation

167
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,349
if that is a more suitable way for you
to transport the remains back home.

168
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,110
(speaking broken French)

169
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,834
- I'm sorry, I don't speak French.
- Oh, do you mind if I sit here?

170
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,990
Because there's
no other seats available.

171
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,469
Hi. I'm Joost. I'm from Amsterdam.

172
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,238
- Tom.
- Hey, Tom.

173
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,279
I saw you on the train this morning.

174
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,238
We came from Paris.
We were on the same train.

175
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,833
You're not a pilgrim, are you?

176
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,755
A pilgrim? A trekker? A peregrino? Huh?

177
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,593
You're not here to walk
the Santiago de Compostela.

178
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,831
- No, I'm here on family business.
- Ah.

179
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,431
Well, it's not for everyone, you know.

180
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,632
In fact, somebody died
on the Camino this week,

181
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,478
only one day into the trek.

182
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,993
Yeah, such a tragedy.

183
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,199
Yes.

184
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,748
But it's no mystery
why I'm doing this trek.

185
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,193
You see this gut?

186
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,874
My older brother is getting married
in Rotterdam in December

187
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,797
and I want to fit into my old suit.

188
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,638
You could just buy a new suit.

189
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,472
No, but it's the third time
that he's getting married.

190
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,352
But wedding or not, I mean...
A bit leaner, a bit lighter.

191
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,232
It would make my doctor

192
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,315
and my wife a bit happier.

193
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,628
No? Ah!

194
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,119
(thanking in French)

195
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,274
Oh!

196
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,993
It's for energy.

197
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,239
(Daniel) Listen.

198
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,159
My doctorate...

199
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,799
I'm not gonna finish it.

200
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,639
You mean this year?

201
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,754
I mean ever.

202
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,275
I can't learn about the world in school.

203
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,630
(Tom chuckling) You're not just
in school. You're at Berkeley.

204
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,076
Take a semester off, sure,

205
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,636
but don't throw away
the last 10 years of your life.

206
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,876
(Daniel) When was the last time
you travelled abroad?

207
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,678
And I'm not talking about for business.

208
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,432
Nepal. Morocco.

209
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,034
India. Papua New Guinea. Europe.

210
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,595
I gotta go to these places.
I gotta go. I gotta go.

211
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,074
(sniffles)

212
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,755
- Captain.
- Mr. Avery.

213
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,997
I want to cremate the body.

214
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,038
(mortician bidding good night in French)

215
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,830
I'm gonna walk the Camino to Santiago.

216
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,156
Mr. Avery, if you pardon me, please,
you are not prepared to go on this trek.

217
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,829
- You have no equipment or...
- I've got Danny's backpack

218
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,270
- and all his stuff.
- But you haven't trained for this walk.

219
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,433
And no disrespect,
you are more than 60 years old.

220
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,038
So it'll take me a bit longer than most.

221
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,838
You will be lucky if you finish
in two months.

222
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,152
Then I'd better get started.

223
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,032
We're leaving in the morning.

224
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,839
"We"?

225
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,559
Both of us.

226
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,159
(exhales)

227
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,719
Okay.

228
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,679
Here we go.

229
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,193
(horn honking)

230
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,675
Came to give me
another pep talk, Captain?

231
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,033
I came to wish you buen Camino,
Mr. Avery.

232
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,072
And to give you this.

233
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,159
- Is this a good-luck charm?
- Something like that.

234
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,550
You'll know what to do with it
when you get there.

235
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,915
- Get where?
- Cruz de Ferro. It's on the Camino.

236
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,672
You'll be there a month from now.

237
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,671
You can read about it in the guide.

238
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,799
It's a place of much significance.

239
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,198
Mr. Avery, do you know why
you are walking the Way?

240
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,991
I suppose I'm doing it for Daniel.

241
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,993
You walk the Way for yourself.
Only for yourself.

242
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,071
Well, then, I guess
I don't have a clue, Captain.

243
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,639
Mr. Avery,

244
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,638
I have also lost a child.

245
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,748
I wish you a buen Camino.
Enjoy your pilgrimage. Both of you.

246
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,074
Thank you.

247
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,359
Tom.

248
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,072
This is the way.

249
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,632
(indistinct)

250
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,839
(exhales)

251
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,639
(sheep bleating)

252
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,399
(ringing bell)

253
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,313
Peregrino! Shh!

254
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,234
Sorry.

255
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,958
- Are you American?
- Yes.

256
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,156
Americans are always late.

257
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,999
Well. You speak English.

258
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,199
So do you.

259
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,838
It's my first time in Spain.

260
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,992
You are not only in Spain.
You are in the Basque Country.

261
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,838
We are in Navarra.

262
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,669
Well, is there a room
in the Basque Country in Navarra?

263
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,552
A room? You mean a bed?

264
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,632
A bed, a room, it's all the same.
I'm very tired.

265
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,315
15 euros for a bed and food.
But it's late, so no food.

266
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,799
No more cooking.

267
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,470
No food, but still 15 euros?

268
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,432
- Yes.
- (chuckling) Okay.

269
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,159
Shoes here.

270
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,639
(man snoring)

271
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,793
Bathroom there.

272
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,953
You're here.

273
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,558
Welcome to Roncesvalles. Buenas noches.

274
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,953
(man shushing)

275
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,033
(men snoring)

276
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,191
(men coughing)

277
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,559
(coughing continues)

278
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,552
(wrapper rustling)

279
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,833
(chewing)

280
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,352
Pardon me, sir.
Do you have any Grey Poupon?

281
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,111
I followed the same route as you
to a point,

282
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,270
but then I detoured at Valcarlos.

283
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,191
And that's why I got here
a couple of hours before you.

284
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,988
My guidebook didn't say anything
about any detours.

285
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,719
Yeah, but that's because you haven't
got the Dutch guidebook.

286
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,552
- The Dutch guidebook?
- Yep.

287
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,359
Because we Dutch, we're always trying
to find the quickest way

288
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,032
to get to the next party.

289
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,479
Because you know what they say,
"If it ain't Dutch, it ain't much."

290
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,151
- Did the old woman feed you?
- No.

291
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,038
Well, you're lucky.
The meal was as grim as the beds.

292
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,479
Here. Have this.

293
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,835
- No, I can't take your food.
- Yeah, you can.

294
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,871
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

295
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,391
Pamplona in a couple of days.

296
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,869
Hemingway, running of the bulls,
all that.

297
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,837
- I think I might stay there for...
- Peregrinos!

298
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,750
No drugs here! I know what I smell!

299
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,114
I will call the Guardia Civil!

300
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,514
- Yeah.
- I will call the police!

301
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,033
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

302
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,519
(mutters in Dutch)

303
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,352
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah!

304
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,393
What did she mean, drugs?

305
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,834
Oh, nothing.

306
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,589
Well, nothing by Dutch standards.

307
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,436
Just a little tobacco booster.

308
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,278
To help with sleep.

309
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,037
- You want some, Tom?
- No. Thank you.

310
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,428
Sure?

311
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,039
I'm sure.

312
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,439
Here.

313
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,592
I also have these options.

314
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,314
Ambien, earplugs.

315
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,439
(snoring)

316
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,958
(people chattering)

317
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,315
I know you've got a thing
for Dutch men, señora.

318
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,199
Have you ever walked the Camino, señora?

319
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,633
No, never.

320
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,631
When I was young, I was too busy.

321
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,038
And now that I am older,

322
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,914
I'm too tired.

323
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,079
Buen Camino.

324
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,910
Hey, Tom, we should get a coffee here
before we go.

325
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,911
Just to get our motor running, no?

326
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,551
Yeah, we'll have a quick coffee.

327
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,632
Oh, look! A cheese maker, Tom!

328
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,280
(laughs) Fresh goat cheese, my man!

329
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,399
Come on, Tom!

330
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,756
You haven't lived until you have
goat cheese from these mountains.

331
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,313
(greeting in Spanish)

332
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,193
Are you gonna make it, fat man?

333
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,111
Don't you worry about me, old man.

334
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:06,553
Hey, Tom. When we met in Saint-Jean, you
said nothing about going on pilgrimage.

335
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,437
I wasn't going on pilgrimage.

336
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,314
But here we are.

337
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,514
Yeah.

338
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,434
You said you were on family business?

339
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,119
I am.

340
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,589
But you have all the equipment
for the walk to Santiago.

341
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,034
Yeah.

342
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,229
Tom, that box with the ashes...

343
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,759
My son.

344
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,153
I'm done for the day, Joost.
I'm staying here tonight.

345
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,711
- Here? In this village?
- Yeah.

346
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,353
But Pamplona's a stone's throw away.

347
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,556
My feet are killing me.
I gotta get out of these shoes.

348
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,352
I'm sorry, but not me, man.

349
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,591
- Pamplona beckons!
- Okay.

350
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,673
It's been a pleasure, Tom.

351
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,832
Hey, uh, buen Camino.

352
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,037
(all chattering)

353
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,839
Ah!

354
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,633
(greeting in Spanish)

355
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,794
- I don't speak Spanish.
- We were expecting you.

356
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,634
Expecting me?

357
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,228
- You are a pilgrim, sí?
- Yes.

358
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,038
We are always expecting pilgrims.

359
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,312
Come, we have plenty of beds
and your food is still warm.

360
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,317
Hey, the Americans are here!

361
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,788
(booing)

362
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,313
Bueno, bueno, bueno!

363
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,269
Come. Vamos. Come on.

364
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,434
(♫ The Star-Spangled Banner)

365
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,751
(Don Santiago) The truth of the matter
is confused.

366
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,798
No, Charlemagne had other ideas.

367
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,235
To extend his empire.

368
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,472
He crossed the Pyrenees,
but nothing worked out as he intended.

369
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,914
This is Spain!

370
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,792
This is Basque Spain!

371
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,751
He tortured the Basques of Pamplona

372
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,794
and allowed his men to have
a little too much

373
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,189
rest and relaxation with our women.

374
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,273
When the Basque shepherds,
who lived around here,

375
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,431
heard what happened in Pamplona,

376
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,474
they slipped into the woods,
and we, we Basques, killed them.

377
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,113
Sorry, monsieur,

378
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,191
but based on what I have read here,

379
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,397
that is complete crap. D'accord?

380
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,311
You won't find much truth in this book.

381
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,471
Charlemagne. Roland.
Not "Rolan", Roland.

382
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,596
This is part of French history, okay?

383
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,955
- No, not Basque!
- (agreeing in French)

384
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,953
The French don't want to admit
that the death of Roland

385
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,237
was because of Charlemagne's
un-Christian intentions.

386
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,594
Come on! Allez!

387
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,318
- (bids good night in French)
- (man laughing)

388
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,237
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

389
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,669
- Night.
- Wait a minute. Señor, señor.

390
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,830
I thought it was the Arabs
that killed Roland.

391
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,439
(Don Santiago groaning)

392
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,474
(guests laughing)

393
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,157
(guests chattering)

394
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,031
One of the guys said you're Canadian.

395
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,230
Don't spread it around, eh?

396
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,074
So how's it going for you out there
on the road, Boomer?

397
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,434
I'm Tom.

398
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,637
You know, as in "baby boomer".

399
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,359
You got all those horrible signs

400
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,556
of that desperate generation
taking its final breath,

401
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,279
trying to screw the rest of us over
one last time.

402
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,272
Only thing missing from you, Boomer,
is one of those stupid-looking ponytails

403
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,555
and a collection of James Taylor songs
on your iPod.

404
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,193
I like James Taylor,

405
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,793
but I don't have an iPod.

406
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,632
Well, that's pretty amazing. What?

407
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,349
No iPod, no cell phone
or computer to keep you connected?

408
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,396
Isn't it written somewhere
in the Baby Boomer Code Book

409
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,790
that you must own a certain percentage
of anything Steve Jobs makes?

410
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,798
So what is it?
On pilgrimage to change your life?

411
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,156
- Something like that.
- Wait. Don't tell me.

412
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,152
Just getting over a nasty divorce
and she took it all?

413
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,271
Or maybe you're out
to meet some young chicks

414
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,316
and relive your college glory days.

415
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,829
Believe me, I've seen plenty
of that nonsense.

416
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,514
Oh, I got it. You're seeking penance

417
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,434
for screwing over your company retirees
in some stock market scandal.

418
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,033
You sound really angry.

419
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,915
Yeah. Sure. I'm angry.

420
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,959
I gotta quit these

421
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,955
and I'm really, really angry about that.

422
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,274
And when we get
to Santiago de Compostela,

423
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,398
it's all over for you, my little friend.
You're a goner.

424
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,832
The end of the Camino
is the end of my addiction.

425
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,832
Spoken like a true addict.

426
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,193
Spoken like someone who took 10 days
to get this far.

427
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,115
Well, at that pace you should get
to Santiago by the end of the year.

428
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,351
He's onto our plan.

429
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,993
- But, you know...
- (guests singing drunkenly)

430
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,712
(Don Santiago exclaiming)

431
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,429
(thanking in Spanish)

432
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,314
(chuckles)

433
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,233
I wanted to be a bullfighter.

434
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,237
My father wanted me to be a lawyer.

435
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,432
I became neither.

436
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,036
Coffee is in the common area.

437
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,638
Bonjour, Americano!

438
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,152
I thought you might be staying
at least a few more days here, eh?

439
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,559
Funny.

440
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,710
These European guys are starting
to get a little familiar.

441
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,837
I want to get out of here while they're
still sleeping off their hangover.

442
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,674
Besides, I got all the friends I need.
Don't want any tagalongs, so...

443
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,319
Well, be safe out there.

444
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,272
(sighs) You too, Boomer.

445
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,474
- Good luck with the quitting.
- (chuckles) Yeah.

446
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,029
Good luck with whatever it is
you're doing out here.

447
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,118
We're all just taking
a really long walk, I suppose.

448
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,031
That's one way to look at it.

449
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,879
Oh!

450
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,992
I do have a cell phone.

451
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,354
Yeah, well,

452
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,833
me, too.

453
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,759
And an iPod.

454
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,953
Sorry for being such an ass last night.

455
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,754
I'm out here to get away from everything
and you just...

456
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,478
Reminded you of it.

457
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,113
Yeah, I get it.

458
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,159
Well...

459
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,792
You're all right, Boomer.

460
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,030
Even if you do like James Taylor.

461
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,231
(♫ Country Road by James Taylor)

462
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,556
I'm gonna need you to cancel
all my appointments

463
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,551
for the rest of the month, Doreen.

464
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,793
Oh, no!

465
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,279
(animal howls)

466
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,078
(footsteps approaching)

467
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,831
- Buen Camino.
- (greeting in Spanish)

468
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,593
Tom!

469
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,833
Tom, it's me!

470
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,229
Tom, it's Joost! From Amsterdam!

471
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,519
It's cordero.

472
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,751
Spain is famous for its roast lamb. Mmm!

473
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,035
- Here. You should try some.
- No. Thank you.

474
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,238
Much to my dismay,

475
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,914
Pamplona is just an ordinary Spanish
city when the bulls are not running.

476
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,316
So much for being a party town.

477
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,472
But I've made reservations
to return here in July

478
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,995
during the week of fiestas.

479
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,278
The Sanfermines!

480
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,272
I would like to propose a toast.

481
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,590
'Cause we Dutch love to propose toasts.

482
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,998
That we agree to meet here in July

483
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,628
and run with the bulls, like real men.

484
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,273
Like real crazy men.

485
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,998
Well, I'm gonna come back.

486
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,754
- Wine shots, huh?
- (coughs) Yeah.

487
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,233
What are your plans?

488
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,031
To move through Pamplona quickly,
and as long as I'm sitting here,

489
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,838
I might just order some tapas.

490
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,837
- Señor!
- They're called pintxos.

491
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,757
I beg your pardon, Joost.
In Pamplona they're called tapas.

492
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,600
Here in Pamplona, it's "tapas".
I just read that.

493
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,029
You see, unlike the Dutch guidebook,

494
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,111
which may be directing you
to the nearest party,

495
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,078
the American guidebook is designed
so that you don't look like a clown

496
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,038
if you order "pintxos" when you
really mean "tapas."

497
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,350
- Señor?
- Tom.

498
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,639
Señor? Algo más?

499
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,073
Tapas, por favor.

500
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,435
Tapas? Aquíno hay "tapas".

501
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,192
- No hay tapas?
- No, no, no.

502
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,357
"Tapas" es más de Madrid, del Sur.

503
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,274
Aquíestamos en Navarra,
en Navarra, son los pintxos.

504
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,753
(explaining in Spanish)

505
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,793
Quiere pintxos?

506
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,713
Oh, look!

507
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,598
It's Tom Quixote and Sancho Panza.

508
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,273
(Joost) And that would make
you Dulcinea.

509
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,191
Buen Camino, fellow pilgrim.

510
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,230
Buen Camino. My name is Joost.
I'm from Amsterdam.

511
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,192
Dutch, huh? Got any drugs?

512
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,352
- Oh, I love this girl!
- It wears off quick, I promise.

513
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,030
- You know each other?
- Sort of.

514
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,313
- What are you looking to score?
- Something for sleep.

515
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,477
I've had trouble sleeping for the past,
I don't know, couple of years.

516
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,516
Do you folks mind doing this drug deal
while we walk?

517
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,313
I've got some Ambien.

518
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,311
Or something stronger
if that's your pleasure.

519
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,232
I love this guy!

520
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,317
It wears off quick, I promise.

521
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,993
- Come. Come with us.
- Oh!

522
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,192
Tom, wait.

523
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,875
I tried to quit once.
But then I thought, "why?"

524
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,317
My grandmother, she drank
and she smoked her entire life

525
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,029
and she lived to be 103 years old.
Now what does that tell you?

526
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,111
It tells me that everyone
who is trying to quit something

527
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,272
always has an ancient relative they use
as an example of why not to quit.

528
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,079
- I suppose that makes me a cliché, then.
- You said it.

529
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,550
But I'm not the one trying
to quit anything.

530
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,793
Yeah, well...

531
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,030
We keep walking at this pace,

532
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,236
quitting isn't gonna be the problem.

533
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,118
Surviving will be.

534
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,791
Doesn't this guy ever stop
to smell the flowers?

535
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,039
(sighs)

536
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,310
- This isn't a race.
- No, it isn't.

537
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,754
Then why does it piss me off so much

538
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,956
that I haven't seen him
stop to take a break?

539
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,237
Why does something that should be
inspirational make me so

540
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,593
angry?

541
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,159
Totally irrational.

542
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,196
The same could be said
for this entire journey.

543
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,833
- Wonder how old he is.
- Older than us.

544
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,153
Hey, Tom!

545
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,597
You think I'll look like this
by the time I get to Santiago?

546
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,633
Yeah, sure, Joost.

547
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,030
Just keep eating that cordero.

548
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,835
Nothing like a few pounds of lamb
to help shed the excess weight.

549
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,156
But it's part of
the Camino experience, no?

550
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,118
I mean, you can't come to Spain
without having their roast lamb.

551
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,273
(reading in Spanish)

552
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,834
"Where the path of the wind
crosses that of the stars."

553
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,952
What do you think the waist is
on this guy?

554
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,919
32?

555
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,794
More like a 25 or 26.

556
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,637
Well, a man can dream.

557
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,753
(cyclist ringing bell)

558
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,231
What? You can do this on a bike?

559
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,792
Why the hell are we walking?

560
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,956
Oh, that's ridiculous, man.

561
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,755
Try that. It's super strong.
I brought it from Amsterdam.

562
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,638
It's really good. You do smoke up?

563
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,759
(chuckling)

564
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,193
Hey, I'm Frank. New York.

565
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,357
Tom, California.
Nice to meet you, Rabbi.

566
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,271
Oh, actually I'm a priest.

567
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,672
You can understand my confusion.

568
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,990
Yeah, a lot of people make that mistake.

569
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,479
Brain cancer. The surgery left me
with a terrible scar.

570
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,710
I wear this yarmulke to cover it up.

571
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,111
They didn't get it all, you know?

572
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,554
The cancer.

573
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,796
Said it'll probably come back.

574
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,150
Who knows about these kinds of things?
Only God.

575
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:30,870
Anyway, they say that miracles happen
out here on the Camino de Santiago.

576
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,433
Do you believe in miracles, Father?

577
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,154
I'm a priest. It's kind of my job.

578
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,918
- You a Catholic?
- I don't practise any more.

579
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,435
You know, Mass at Christmas, Easter.
That's about it.

580
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,517
Here. Take this.

581
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,234
- No, I can't take your rosary, Father.
- No, please, take it.

582
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,830
A lot of lapsed Catholics out here
on the Camino, kid.

583
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,431
Besides... (chuckles)

584
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,834
Thank you.

585
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,752
(bell ringing)

586
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,075
(welcoming in Spanish)

587
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:34,352
(chattering indistinctly)

588
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,153
(toasting)

589
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,798
(all cheering)

590
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,834
(toasting indistinctly)

591
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,633
(all toasting)

592
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,033
(church bell tolling)

593
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,714
Fore!

594
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:05,439
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!
I'm sorry! Sorry!

595
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,034
I didn't mean to do that!

596
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,200
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

597
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,232
I thought I was out here all alone.

598
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,391
- You thought wrong.
- Oh, yes.

599
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,029
Hello! I'm Jack from Ireland.

600
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,838
I'm Jack from Ireland.

601
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,952
How long you been out here,
Jack from Ireland?

602
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,076
On the Camino
or in this particular spot?

603
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,431
- You pick.
- On the Camino, well, jeez...

604
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,475
It's hard to say. This spot, well...

605
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,953
It's hard to say that, too.

606
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,031
But I think this place means something.

607
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,276
"This place means something"?

608
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,431
This place is brimming
with significance!

609
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,272
That's the problem
with this whole damn road.

610
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,033
- Problem?
- Metaphor, man!

611
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,549
You're out walking all alone and
suddenly in the middle of nowhere

612
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,315
you see a dogfight near a cheese farm.
What does that dogfight mean?

613
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,312
And despite its literalness,

614
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,837
the idea of a pilgrim's journey
on this road is a metaphor bonanza!

615
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,959
Friends, the road itself
is amongst our oldest tropes.

616
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,270
The high road and the low.
The long and winding.

617
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,749
The lonesome. The royal.
The open road and the private.

618
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,149
You have the road to hell.
The tobacco road.

619
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,639
The crooked, the straight
and the narrow.

620
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,234
There's the road stretching
into infinity,

621
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,392
bordered with lacy mists,
favored by sentimental poets.

622
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,511
There's the more dignified road
of Mr. Frost.

623
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,958
And for Yanks, every four years,
there is the road to the White House.

624
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,031
There is the right road.

625
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,516
Then you have the road
which most concerns me today.

626
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,798
The wrong road.

627
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:35,117
Which I fear I must surely have taken.

628
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,080
Well, Jack, maybe a dogfight
near a cheese farm

629
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,549
is simply a dogfight near a cheese farm.

630
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,314
Ah!

631
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,674
Okay!

632
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:52,438
That's good. That is very good.

633
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,589
(muttering) Dog fight near
a cheese farm...

634
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,551
Maybe there's no such thing
as metaphors.

635
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,234
Maybe I should adopt
a more conservative attitude

636
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,631
instead of trying to trickle meaning
out of every curve in the road.

637
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,509
Christ, I haven't had
an original thought in months.

638
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,232
Writer's block.

639
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,674
You know what that is? Any of you?

640
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,119
Writer's block?

641
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,594
And I...

642
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,353
- I'm a writer.
- Okay, so...

643
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:26,149
The reason I'm out here
walking the Camino. Writer's block.

644
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,674
I figure the sooner we get the
small talk out of the way, the better.

645
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,591
Now you know why I'm on pilgrimage.

646
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,988
Great.

647
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,433
(mobile ringing)

648
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,239
Hmm...

649
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,714
(automated voice) Mailbox full.

650
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,349
- Ah!
- You have 35 unheard messages.

651
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,113
All from my editors,
who probably think I'm drinking again.

652
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,278
Which isn't a bad idea.

653
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,194
Well, they'll get their book.

654
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,837
Maybe not when they want it,
but they'll get it, by God!

655
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,235
Ooh! Can I bum one of those, please?

656
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,479
Oh. Uh, yes, sure. Sure.

657
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,239
Thank you.

658
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,759
So, uh,

659
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,991
what's your book about, Jack?

660
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,035
- The Camino, of course.
- Of course.

661
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,834
- What about all of you?
- What about all of us what?

662
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,672
Why you're doing the Camino.

663
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,559
Most of the pilgrims I've polled
say their walk to Santiago

664
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,949
is for religious, cultural
or historical reasons.

665
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,270
- You're taking a poll?
- Aye, informally,

666
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:25,797
though I have been keeping track of most
of the pilgrims I've met along the way.

667
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,714
So far,

668
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,792
less than 15 percent said
they were doing it for health.

669
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,832
Fewer than five percent said they were
out here looking for a miracle.

670
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,150
Miracles are in short supply
these days, Jack.

671
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,468
Well,

672
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,232
if you don't mind,
I'd like to include you in my poll.

673
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,833
I do mind.

674
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,353
Very much so.

675
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,838
Oh, uh...

676
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,992
Would it be all right if I

677
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,559
walk with you for a bit?

678
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,069
Well, I don't know about them.

679
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,514
Oh, okay.

680
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,469
But it's okay. It's cool with me, man.

681
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,437
- Really?
- Yeah, sure.

682
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:09,953
I'm Joost. I'm from Amsterdam.

683
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,076
Joost? Right. Hey.

684
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:16,718
I mean, I'm not here for God or miracles
or any of that stuff.

685
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,793
I'm just a fat Dutchman
trying to lose a few pounds.

686
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,473
So you're doing it for health reasons?

687
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,556
(stammering) Yeah, you could
more or less say that. Yeah.

688
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,312
Yeah, well, would it be all right

689
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,632
if I put you under the category
"doing it for health" for my poll?

690
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,795
- Yeah, man, sure. Whatever. Yeah.
- Really?

691
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,273
Joost.

692
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,113
Dutch.

693
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,474
Health.

694
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,318
Ah. Thanks.

695
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,792
Would you like to try some of this?
It's Turkish.

696
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,429
I hear it's good for writer's block.

697
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,112
You may be right, Joost.

698
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,554
Yeah, man.

699
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,957
Tom! Hey, Tom!

700
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,594
Everything all right?

701
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,079
Yeah, sure.

702
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,592
(Jack) So what's her story?

703
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,671
(Joost) Tom met her in a refugio.

704
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,910
Walking the Camino to quit smoking.

705
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,593
That's all I know about her.

706
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,719
She's sexy

707
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,472
but complicated.

708
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,876
He seems like quite a stiff.

709
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,559
I met him in Saint-Jean.

710
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,440
He's an ophth... Um...

711
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,037
An eye doctor from California.

712
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,519
An ophthalmologist.

713
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,312
He didn't come here on pilgrimage.

714
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,917
Seems like it was more like an accident.

715
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:13,120
I started my pilgrimage in Paris, Joost.

716
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,072
Three months ago.

717
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,478
And if I know one certainty about
the Way of St James,

718
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:22,315
it is that no one walks this Camino
by accident. No one.

719
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:27,672
He carries the cremated remains
of his son.

720
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:31,751
He got caught in a bad storm
over the Pyrenees, first day out.

721
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,789
- Oh, you're kidding me.
- No.

722
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,588
He carries that box in his backpack.

723
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,279
He leaves little piles of ash
all along the Camino.

724
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,514
That's brilliant!
I mean, tragic, of course.

725
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,114
But brilliant.

726
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,633
Um...

727
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,792
Do you think he'd want
to talk to me about it?

728
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:02,716
I think he'd sooner shove
that walking stick down your throat.

729
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,950
- You're sick.
- What?

730
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,553
The reason you're out here.

731
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:15,758
- You're ill and dying.
- Not even close.

732
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,273
That's good.

733
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,713
But I will get it.

734
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,512
No, you probably won't.

735
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,428
Next town is Torres Del Río.
