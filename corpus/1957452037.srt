get put in. (CLEARS THROAT)

343
00:20:02,854 --> 00:20:05,106
Doesn't make any sense
to build with a septic system

when they're putting in
sewers soon.

for a lake house Christmas.

I won't miss

00:20:28,713 --> 00:20:31,883
I headed up maintenance

they needed
an Equipment Manager, so...

It's not a candle store,

00:27:01,105 --> 00:27:02,899
but end of the day,

509
00:27:03,816 --> 00:27:06,110
everything anyone's got...

510
00:27:06,152 --> 00:27:08,446
I don't care how many
candles you have,

511
00:27:08,488 --> 00:27:10,948
one day it goes.

512
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,451
Whatever gifts God's given
us, in the end,

513
00:27:13,493 --> 00:27:16,537
no matter who you are,
everything you have goes.

514
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:23,127
Well, that's the positive way
of looking at things.

515
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:25,088
BRIGID: (LAUGHS) I mean...

516
00:27:25,129 --> 00:27:26,422
- AIMEE: Wow.
- ERIK: What?

517
00:27:26,464 --> 00:27:28,132
- BRIGID: Ooh.
- AIMEE: That's just so...

(BRIGID LAUGHING)

519
00:27:29,634 --> 00:27:31,469
- That's a lot.
- I'm sorry.

520
00:27:31,511 --> 00:27:32,762
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah.

521
00:27:32,804 --> 00:27:34,639
I love my family.
That's the short version.

522
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,099
- BRIGID: Oh, maybe, yeah.
- AIMEE: That one's better.

523
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,726
Okay... (EXCLAIMS)
I'm glad we're together.

524
00:27:38,768 --> 00:27:41,229
AIMEE: Yeah, wow.
You should do that at a funeral.

525
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,563

00:27:49,028 --> 00:27:50,988
- Richard.
- So nice. It's so nice.

529
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,615
I can't.

530
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,618
It's a whole fire.

531
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,286
Shut it down.

532
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:05,169
- That sets the tone.

534
00:28:06,587 --> 00:28:07,713
AIMEE: So how you doing, Mom?

535
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:10,091
DEIRDRE: Ah, I'm good,
I'm good.

536
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:12,343
Oh, did you get
that text I sent you?

537
00:28:12,385 --> 00:28:14,762
Bridge, this girl who played
basketball for Dunmore

538
00:28:14,804 --> 00:28:17,140
was bullied for being gay.

539
00:28:17,181 --> 00:28:19,851
Her mom found her dead
in her room on Tuesday.

540
00:28:19,892 --> 00:28:21,477
- BRIGID: Whoa.
- AIMEE: Oh, man.

541
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:24,480
Yeah, suicide with
some kinda pills.

542
00:28:24,522 --> 00:28:26,023
It's all over the news.

543
00:28:26,065 --> 00:28:28,693
I texted you, I was sure to...
I wasn't sure if you got it?

544
00:28:28,734 --> 00:28:30,486
AIMEE: Yeah,
this week was crazy.

545
00:28:30,528 --> 00:28:33,990
No, I'm just behind
with messages, yeah.

546
00:28:34,031 --> 00:28:35,366
BRIGID: Yeah, you don't
have to text her

547
00:28:35,408 --> 00:28:37,034
every time
a lesbian kills herself.

548
00:28:37,076 --> 00:28:39,120
- I don't.
- AIMEE: She doesn't do that.

549
00:28:39,162 --> 00:28:41,080
- I get enough...
- AIMEE: Look, I appreciate it.

550
00:28:41,122 --> 00:28:42,540
...annoying forwards myself.

551
00:28:42,582 --> 00:28:44,041
I'm not gonna clog up
your guys' inbox.

552
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:47,128
AIMEE: No, you're not, Mom.
You're good, though?

553
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,588
- I am, yeah.
- Yeah?

RICHARD: Salsa...

556
00:28:51,424 --> 00:28:53,217
I'm an office manager, Rich,

557
00:28:53,259 --> 00:28:54,594
I've been with the same
company since right

558
00:28:54,635 --> 00:28:56,137
- out of high school.
- RICHARD: Oh.

559
00:28:56,179 --> 00:28:57,805
ERIK: Whole place'd
fall apart without her.

560
00:28:57,847 --> 00:29:00,600
Yeah, well, my salary
doesn't reflect that.

561
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:04,187
And these new kids
they've hired,

562
00:29:04,228 --> 00:29:08,608
I'm now working for two
more guys in their 20s.

563
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:10,484
I don't even wanna talk
about it.

564
00:29:10,526 --> 00:29:12,111
ERIK: Can you pass me the...

565
00:29:12,737 --> 00:29:13,946
Thank you.

566
00:29:13,988 --> 00:29:15,823
And just because they have
a special degree,

567
00:29:15,865 --> 00:29:17,825
they're making five times
what I make,

568
00:29:17,867 --> 00:29:19,243
over 40 years
I've been there.

569
00:29:19,285 --> 00:29:21,162
- RICHARD: Wow, 40 years.
- Hey, focus on the lake house,

570
00:29:21,204 --> 00:29:22,663
you can unwind soon.

571
00:29:22,705 --> 00:29:24,332
You gotta take care
of yourself.

572
00:29:24,373 --> 00:29:26,751
RICHARD: You know, it's smart
to wait for the sewers.

573
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:28,920
That'll... Property value
is gonna skyrocket.

574
00:29:28,961 --> 00:29:30,087
BRIGID: Thanks, Professor.

575
00:29:30,129 --> 00:29:31,422
AIMEE: Yeah, when are they
gonna be installed?

576
00:29:31,464 --> 00:29:34,091
ERIK: It's up to the
Department of Public Works.

577
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:36,093
- AIMEE: Hmm.
- RICHARD: Okay, we got...

578
00:29:36,135 --> 00:29:39,555
- AIMEE: And how's Aunt Mary?
- (LAUGHS)

579
00:29:39,597 --> 00:29:42,516
Oh, she's hanging in there,
God love her.

580
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:44,060
Rich, this is their aunt

581
00:29:44,101 --> 00:29:46,479
- who had both knees replaced.
- ERIK: Can you pass the...

582
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,813
I drive her
to her physical therapy.

583
00:29:47,855 --> 00:29:49,857
BRIGID: Get it yourself.

584
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:51,776
They got
this contraption now

585
00:29:52,902 --> 00:29:54,654
to help load her
into the pool.

586
00:29:54,695 --> 00:29:56,864
AIMEE: Oh, fancy.

587
00:29:56,906 --> 00:30:00,868
Oh, and did I e-mail you that
Pam Hoban has ovarian cancer?

588
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:01,994
BRIGID: She does? Yikes.

589
00:30:02,036 --> 00:30:03,120
AIMEE: Oh, man,
how's she doing?

590
00:30:03,162 --> 00:30:05,957
Yeah, I'm taking her
to her treatments

591
00:30:05,998 --> 00:30:08,042
'cause her and her brother,

592
00:30:08,084 --> 00:30:09,752
they don't speak anymore.

593
00:30:11,295 --> 00:30:12,964
She's being tough, so...

(SIGHS) What else?

595
00:30:17,843 --> 00:30:19,470
Oh, on Tuesdays I'm...

with your mouth full.

00:30:25,685 --> 00:30:27,144
I'm now volunteering...

598
00:30:28,354 --> 00:30:29,563
Father Paul told me...

599
00:30:29,605 --> 00:30:31,315
And don't
roll your eyes, Erik.

is coming to their rescue?

ERIK: You have no idea.

607
00:30:46,372 --> 00:30:50,334
Be quiet, you have no idea,
these people have nothing.

608
00:30:50,376 --> 00:30:53,254
They're all just looking to
learn English, to find work.

609

We think we have nothing,
but, man.

you're volunteering.

And how are you, Mom?

613
00:31:05,391 --> 00:31:08,019
Aimee didn't ask how the
Republic of Bhutan was doing.

614
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,646
I'm good, smart-ass,
I said that already.

615
00:31:10,688 --> 00:31:11,814
Now why don't you open
your gifts.

I was just teasing.

no one be alarmed

if I'm up and down these
stairs, like, a million times

- You want me to go with you?

...is beautiful wrapping.

622
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:28,664
I believe I picked it out,
when I gave you...

I believe you might have.

624

Oh, Rich. Check it out.

627
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:40,217
- Oh, this is awesome, thanks.
- And what is this other...

628
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:43,137
- DEIRDRE: Honey, it's fragile.
- ...beautiful,

- Ooh.
- Okay, before you tease me...

under her foot.

appearing everywhere now,

but in West Virginia...

636

- Mm-hmm.
- DEIRDRE: And...

637
00:32:01,906 --> 00:32:04,075
Just keep it for my sake
in the kitchen,

638
00:32:04,116 --> 00:32:06,077
or even if you put it
in a drawer somewhere, okay?

639
00:32:06,118 --> 00:32:08,579
Mom, I will absolutely

640
00:32:08,621 --> 00:32:10,289
put this in a drawer
somewhere, thank you.

for a ride, Mom?

in the morning.

couldn't have been any scarier

than the, um...

650
00:33:00,005 --> 00:33:01,966
I made him watch this...
(CHUCKLES)

651
00:33:02,007 --> 00:33:04,093
What was it called, Erik?
The movie...

652
00:33:04,135 --> 00:33:06,554
The Lifetime movie about
the housewife who got AIDS.

653

she made me watch it.

cheesy, but really terrifying.

of my life.

What was so scary about it?

DEIRDRE: Well, this housewife
cheats on her husband

658
00:33:14,061 --> 00:33:17,648
and he comes home from work
and asks her how her day was.

- ...you get two families.
- BRIGID: Okay.

847
00:43:12,075 --> 00:43:15,245
RICHARD: I am
very committed to Brigid.

848
00:43:16,288 --> 00:43:17,706
- (ERIK SIGHS)
- DEIRDRE: Well,

849
00:43:17,748 --> 00:43:19,458
Mom's calm now, Rich,

850
00:43:19,499 --> 00:43:21,460
but, man,
when she isn't, it's...

851
00:43:22,252 --> 00:43:23,295
It's like watching her

852
00:43:23,336 --> 00:43:25,630
turn into someone else,
you know?

853
00:43:25,672 --> 00:43:28,091
RICHARD: Can I...

854
00:43:28,133 --> 00:43:30,761
DEIRDRE: Oh, yeah,
just lift her feet back.

855
00:43:30,802 --> 00:43:33,305
Before we got her
on these new meds,

856
00:43:33,346 --> 00:43:35,223
you could've put
some of her worst outbursts

857
00:43:35,265 --> 00:43:36,308
in a horror flick.

858
00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:38,018
- ERIK: Brigid's? I agree.
- BRIGID: Dad.

859
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,478
DEIRDRE: No, I'm serious.

860
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:42,064
- BRIGID: Richard...
- RICHARD: Ambiance.

861
00:43:42,105 --> 00:43:45,150
DEIRDRE: Seeing these ads
for that zombie show on TV.

862
00:43:45,192 --> 00:43:46,234
I can't believe people

863
00:43:46,276 --> 00:43:47,944
wanna watch
that kind of stuff at night.

864
00:43:47,986 --> 00:43:49,112
- There's always...
- BRIGID: Oh,

865
00:43:49,154 --> 00:43:51,198
she hates anything
with blood or gore.

866
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:53,033
Yeah, there's enough
going on in the real world

867
00:43:53,075 --> 00:43:54,284
to give me the creeps,

868
00:43:54,326 --> 00:43:55,786
- I don't need any more...
- RICHARD: That's like...

869
00:43:55,827 --> 00:43:57,287
I bet she'd appreciate, uh...

870
00:43:57,329 --> 00:43:59,956
There's this comic book
called <i>Quasar</i>

871
00:43:59,998 --> 00:44:02,793
that I was obsessed with
as a kid, and it's about...

872
00:44:02,834 --> 00:44:04,419
BRIGID: You're still
obsessed with <i>Quasar.</i>

873
00:44:04,461 --> 00:44:07,130
RICHARD: Okay, well,
I am, be quiet, um...

874
00:44:07,172 --> 00:44:10,634
It's about this species
of, like, half-alien,

875
00:44:10,675 --> 00:44:13,428
half-demon creatures
with teeth on their backs.

876
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:14,971
BRIGID: Oh, my God,
just call them monsters.

877
00:44:15,013 --> 00:44:16,264
And in their world...

878
00:44:16,306 --> 00:44:19,476
And on their planet,
they like...

879
00:44:19,518 --> 00:44:20,811
The scary stories

880
00:44:20,852 --> 00:44:24,356
that they tell each other
are all about us.

881
00:44:24,397 --> 00:44:26,691
The horror stories
for the monsters

882
00:44:26,733 --> 00:44:28,026
are about humans.

883
00:44:28,068 --> 00:44:29,152
BRIGID: Thank God
he's in grad school.

884
00:44:29,194 --> 00:44:30,487
I love that.

885
00:44:30,529 --> 00:44:33,782
DEIRDRE: Well, people are...
You should meet my boss.

886
00:44:33,824 --> 00:44:35,158
No teeth on his back,

887
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,368
- but, man...
- RICHARD: Mm-hmm.

888
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:37,994
The monsters
aren't scared of us,

889
00:44:38,036 --> 00:44:39,246
- so why would...
- RICHARD: Sure they are.

890
00:44:39,287 --> 00:44:41,873
There's...
It's always a man driving a stake

891
00:44:41,915 --> 00:44:43,208
through the heart
of a vampire,

892
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:46,294
or if you're a zombie,
you eat people,

893
00:44:46,336 --> 00:44:48,380
but your biggest threat
is what?

894
00:44:48,421 --> 00:44:50,298
Getting killed by some
enterprising human, right?

895
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,716
- I get it, Rich...
- Yeah.

896
00:44:51,758 --> 00:44:53,468
BRIGID: They'd be more scared
by monster-eating monsters

897
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:55,262
or something, am I right?

898
00:44:55,303 --> 00:44:56,847
Monsters aren't real,

899
00:44:56,888 --> 00:44:59,015
so it's a weird thing
to wanna be right about.

900
00:44:59,057 --> 00:45:00,183
BRIGID: Okay.

901
00:45:00,225 --> 00:45:01,434
RICHARD: Probably
the soundest argument.

902
00:45:01,476 --> 00:45:02,602
DEIRDRE: Not what
you thought last night.

903
00:45:02,644 --> 00:45:03,854
You thought
that was pretty real.

904
00:45:03,895 --> 00:45:05,188
There's sweat
on the sheets to prove it.

905
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:06,690
Oh, man, you can't
let that go, can you?

906
00:45:06,731 --> 00:45:07,983
Well, why don't...

907
00:45:08,024 --> 00:45:09,317
Just tell me what you dreamed,
and I'll drop it.

908
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:10,861
You... You're assuming
I saw something specific

909
00:45:10,902 --> 00:45:12,320
when she just...

910
00:45:12,362 --> 00:45:14,656
- It wasn't like that, okay?
- BRIGID: Wait, wait, "she"?

911
00:45:14,698 --> 00:45:16,366
So you do remember something
specific about that dream.

912
00:45:16,408 --> 00:45:17,492
ERIK: (SIGHS)
You guys are relentless.

913
00:45:17,534 --> 00:45:18,660
Rich, help me out here.

914
00:45:18,702 --> 00:45:20,036
DEIRDRE: Erik, have you
been dreaming about

915
00:45:20,078 --> 00:45:21,204
- a supermodel this whole time?
- I tell Brigid my dreams.

916
00:45:21,246 --> 00:45:22,289
BRIGID: Yes, you do,
all of them.

917
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:23,832
Two weeks ago, I dreamt

918
00:45:23,874 --> 00:45:26,168
that my oldest sister
was a mannequin

919
00:45:26,209 --> 00:45:28,044
- working in a grocery store.
- BRIGID: Richard.

920
00:45:28,086 --> 00:45:29,546
- What, I'm serious.
- (BRIGID SIGHS)

921
00:45:29,588 --> 00:45:31,673
- All I remember...
- DEIRDRE: Ooh, what?

922
00:45:35,135 --> 00:45:36,761
Well, there's not much to...

923
00:45:37,262 --> 00:45:38,430
Tell us.

924
00:45:41,433 --> 00:45:42,726
Come on.

A couple of nights,
I've had this...

927
00:45:49,691 --> 00:45:51,735
There'll be a, uh...

928
00:45:53,403 --> 00:45:54,529
A woman...

929
00:45:55,906 --> 00:45:57,073
BRIGID: And?

930
00:45:58,617 --> 00:45:59,618
What?

931
00:46:02,412 --> 00:46:04,539
And her back is to me...

932
00:46:04,581 --> 00:46:07,584
Or maybe
something happens where...

933
00:46:07,626 --> 00:46:11,171
Her head turns,
and I can see that her face is all...

934
00:46:12,297 --> 00:46:13,506

- BRIGID: Just tell us.

936
00:46:22,307 --> 00:46:23,934
Her skin is stretched

937
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:26,811
over her eyes and her mouth.

938
00:46:27,896 --> 00:46:30,440

should be, you know...

is going on up there?

or something?

to the Oldies up there?

- It's the Faceless Lady...

she wants some turkey.

would she eat turkey?

made of grass

to please...

to the bathroom.

- BRIGID: I can help you, Mom.
- Rich, would you help her

1847

1848

- RICHARD: Sure, yeah.

Just stay.

1850
01:25:27,233 --> 01:25:29,110
- BRIGID: Why?
- Because I wanna, I wanna...

1851
01:25:29,151 --> 01:25:30,945
I wanna talk about how, uh...

1852
01:25:30,987 --> 01:25:32,363
AIMEE: About what?

1853
01:25:35,658 --> 01:25:36,951
ERIK: We may be
moving soon. So...

1854
01:25:36,993 --> 01:25:38,578
- BRIGID: Dad, what's wrong?
- AIMEE: What's going on?

1855

everybody's okay.

1856

- To help with...

Um...

1865
01:26:04,061 --> 01:26:05,146
St. Mark's let me go,

1866
01:26:05,187 --> 01:26:06,230
so we've had to
tighten our belts...

1867
01:26:06,272 --> 01:26:07,523
BRIGID: Why would they
let you go?

1868
01:26:07,565 --> 01:26:09,567
And we're figuring how...
Well, that's not...

1869
01:26:09,609 --> 01:26:10,985
I'm not getting
my pension now,

1870
01:26:11,027 --> 01:26:12,987
they could fire me before
it kicked in, all right?

1871
01:26:13,029 --> 01:26:14,488
AIMEE: They can take away
your pension?

1872
01:26:14,530 --> 01:26:15,823
ERIK: Uh, well,
they're a private school,

1873

But why did they fire you?

1875
01:26:20,995 --> 01:26:23,164
ERIK: They have
a morality code,

1876
01:26:23,205 --> 01:26:24,790
and St. Mark's makes you
sign it

1877
01:26:24,832 --> 01:26:26,500
- and if you...
- Why would a morality code...

1878
01:26:26,542 --> 01:26:28,961
Were you, like,
selling drugs on a playground?

1879
01:26:29,003 --> 01:26:30,338
ERIK: There was
an incident, all right?

1880
01:26:30,379 --> 01:26:31,839
- And they could...
- What kind of incident?

1881
01:26:31,881 --> 01:26:33,507
They could fire me
because of this incident.

1882

What are you
talking about?

1883
01:26:36,135 --> 01:26:38,721
I cheated on your mom
with a teacher from school

1884
01:26:39,889 --> 01:26:41,682
and, um...

1885
01:26:42,933 --> 01:26:43,976
We're okay,

1886
01:26:45,561 --> 01:26:47,521

this is a lot to just...

1887
01:26:56,947 --> 01:26:58,157
Are you guys okay?

1888
01:27:05,289 --> 01:27:07,833
We worked through it,
okay?

1889
01:27:07,875 --> 01:27:09,085
We met with Father Paul

1890
01:27:10,211 --> 01:27:11,337

AIMEE: Okay...

1892
01:27:13,923 --> 01:27:15,883
But people talk and we
don't want you to hear it

1893
01:27:15,925 --> 01:27:17,051
from other people, okay?

1894
01:27:17,093 --> 01:27:18,636
We'd rather
that you hear it from us.

1895
01:27:18,678 --> 01:27:19,887
Okay, so you want us...

1896
01:27:19,929 --> 01:27:22,431
You just want us to just,
what? Just to know?

1897
01:27:24,266 --> 01:27:25,726
ERIK: Yeah.

1898
01:27:25,768 --> 01:27:27,311
I'm already at a Walmart
in Danville,

1899
01:27:27,353 --> 01:27:28,729
to keep money coming in.

1900
01:27:29,522 --> 01:27:30,981
AIMEE: Dad, for how long?

1901
01:27:31,023 --> 01:27:32,316
BRIGID:
Why the one in Danville?

1902
01:27:32,358 --> 01:27:33,567
ERIK: Uh, it's...
I don't want the kids from school

1903
01:27:33,609 --> 01:27:35,236
- seeing me there.
- AIMEE: God.

1904
01:27:35,277 --> 01:27:36,570
ERIK: Something full-time
should open up

1905
01:27:36,612 --> 01:27:37,738
this spring, so...

1906
01:27:37,780 --> 01:27:39,156
AIMEE: So, what...

1907
01:27:39,198 --> 01:27:40,741
ERIK: The cost of taking care
of MoMo's been a surprise.

1908
01:27:40,783 --> 01:27:41,826
- BRIGID: Are you guys...
- You wouldn't even believe

1909
01:27:41,867 --> 01:27:43,285
how much one of...

1910
01:27:43,327 --> 01:27:45,204
AIMEE: Okay, so you're behind.
How much are you behind?

1911
01:27:45,246 --> 01:27:47,498
ERIK: So the plan
is to sell the house

1912
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:49,917
and rent an apartment
because we don't need space.

1913
01:27:49,959 --> 01:27:51,460
BRIGID: Are there even
apartments in Scranton?

1914
01:27:51,502 --> 01:27:53,337
- Who lives in an apartment?
- AIMEE: Of course there are.

1915

ERIK: Hey, getting a place
on one level is good

1916

won't be climbing up stairs.

in savings?

No, I have no savings,
Aimee. No.
