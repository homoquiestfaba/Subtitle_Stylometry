[inhales deeply, exhales]

3
00:02:02,037 --> 00:02:03,373
[knocking at door]

4
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:07,776
- [knocking continues]
- Just a second!

5
00:02:20,823 --> 00:02:22,891
Okay, I'm just
trying to help you.

6
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:30,599
[inaudible]

7
00:02:58,026 --> 00:03:00,227
- [man on phone] <i>Where are you?</i>
- Almost home.

8
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:02,696
<i>I told you
I had a dinner meeting.</i>

9
00:03:02,698 --> 00:03:04,231
I know.

10
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:06,166
<i>I'm turning onto
the street now, okay?</i>

11
00:03:06,168 --> 00:03:07,233
<i>Do you see me?</i>

12
00:03:07,235 --> 00:03:08,670
[man]
Jesus, slow down!

13
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:22,181
You can always just leave
him in the apartment.

14
00:03:22,183 --> 00:03:23,949
He's a big boy,
you know?

15
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:25,785
Leave him
in the apartment?

16
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:27,924
Is that how you want to
spend your week together?

17
00:03:28,556 --> 00:03:29,788
Come on, baby.

18
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,859
Hold on a second.

19
00:03:36,831 --> 00:03:37,933
This is for you.

20
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:51,110
- Go upstairs, baby.
- Can I see...

21
00:03:51,112 --> 00:03:52,481
Upstairs, Thomas.

22
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:55,218
- Gee.
- See you later, pal.

23
00:03:59,288 --> 00:04:00,823
[sighs]

24
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:04,659
[door closes]

25
00:04:06,228 --> 00:04:08,294
Full custody?

26
00:04:08,296 --> 00:04:12,100
It's with visitation. I'm not
trying to take him out of your life.

27
00:04:13,068 --> 00:04:14,537
You know this was coming.

28
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:17,803
You have no grounds.

29
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:20,041
I want what's best for my son.

30
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:22,841
Our son.
Don't we both want that?

31
00:04:22,843 --> 00:04:25,344
We do alternate weeks.
We agreed.

32
00:04:25,346 --> 00:04:27,247
Yeah, we've been through
all this.

33
00:04:27,249 --> 00:04:29,315
In high school,
he's going to need a solid base.

34
00:04:29,317 --> 00:04:31,117
[sighs]

35
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:35,087
Half the kids in that school
have divorced parents.

36
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:36,755
Half the kids
in the fucking world.

37
00:04:36,757 --> 00:04:38,091
Yep. Yeah,

38
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:39,729
but you haven't been
doing so great.

39
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,965
Wow.

40
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:51,239
He feels
your darkness, Lizzie.

41
00:04:51,906 --> 00:04:52,942
[scoffs]

42
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,679
My darkness?

43
00:04:57,245 --> 00:04:59,115
[sighs] Come on. Look,

44
00:05:00,348 --> 00:05:03,082
I know you want him in as
stable a situation as possible.

45
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:04,286
[sighs]

46
00:05:07,822 --> 00:05:08,890
[sniffles]

47
00:05:13,261 --> 00:05:14,697
[sighs]

48
00:05:15,863 --> 00:05:16,998
[door opens]

49
00:05:27,776 --> 00:05:29,845
I have to work
half a day tomorrow.

50
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:32,213
Again?

51
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:39,084
Yeah. So Grandma
will take you to Sam's party.

52
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:40,755
And I'll come later.

53
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:46,262
[sighs]

54
00:05:50,798 --> 00:05:51,933
Do you want to do this?

55
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:54,203
- Can I?
- Yeah.

56
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,973
Now just take
the price tag off.

57
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:19,629
I'm gonna get us
some dinner ready, okay?

58
00:06:21,762 --> 00:06:22,798
Yeah.

59
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,636
- [music playing]
- [children cheering]

60
00:06:35,142 --> 00:06:38,380
Hey, Mom, can I have
a party like this someday?

61
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:43,082
Uh, sure. Why not?

62
00:06:43,084 --> 00:06:45,654
- Really?
- Maybe even in a house like this.

63
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:55,461
[girl] Ten, nine, eight,

64
00:06:55,463 --> 00:06:59,899
seven, six, five, four,

65
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:03,739
three, two, one.

66
00:07:05,973 --> 00:07:08,310
Ready or not,
here I come!

67
00:07:27,862 --> 00:07:29,495
- Boo!
- [gasps]

68
00:07:29,497 --> 00:07:33,065
- Oh, no!
- Oh, don't panic. It's all right.

69
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:36,368
Can't sit back
and watch an innocent skirt die.

70
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,906
- Oh.
- Here you go.

71
00:07:39,074 --> 00:07:40,141
I'm Claire.

72
00:07:40,841 --> 00:07:42,976
I'm Lizzie. Thanks.

73
00:07:42,978 --> 00:07:44,045
No worries.

74
00:08:08,302 --> 00:08:09,872
Who was that little girl?

75
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:13,375
[Thomas] Which one?

76
00:08:16,545 --> 00:08:17,913
Really pretty.

77
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,416
Big brown eyes.

78
00:08:23,218 --> 00:08:26,122
Long hair.
She was in a pink dress.

79
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:28,990
I think that's Jeremy's sister.

80
00:08:32,494 --> 00:08:33,896
Do you know her name?

81
00:08:34,528 --> 00:08:36,028
[Thomas] Who?

82
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,131
Jeremy's little sister.

83
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:39,168
No.

84
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:43,239
No, why would you?

85
00:08:45,506 --> 00:08:46,775
Come on.

86
00:08:51,413 --> 00:08:55,817
Let's have an early one, love.
Teeth, toilet, bed.

87
00:08:57,219 --> 00:08:59,254
[breathes shakily]

88
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:08,897
[girl] <i>Three, two, one.</i>

89
00:09:09,597 --> 00:09:12,033
<i>Ready or not, here I come!</i>

90
00:09:19,941 --> 00:09:22,344
[sniffles]

91
00:09:35,624 --> 00:09:37,026
[exhales sharply]

92
00:09:38,393 --> 00:09:40,428
[chattering]

93
00:09:43,431 --> 00:09:45,466
[laughing]

94
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:53,973
It's so good.
I'm so excited.

95
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:56,177
I haven't seen her for ages.

96
00:10:03,183 --> 00:10:05,086
- Bye!
- Bye, Lola!

97
00:10:06,654 --> 00:10:07,956
[woman] Lola!

98
00:10:10,457 --> 00:10:12,327
- Hi!
- [Lola] Hi!

99
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,333
- Come on!
- [Jeremy] Yeah, coming.

100
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:24,403
[car engine starts]

101
00:10:24,405 --> 00:10:25,607
[gasps]

102
00:11:11,586 --> 00:11:13,286
[woman] What do you want
for afternoon tea?

103
00:11:13,288 --> 00:11:15,021
- Muffins?
- [woman] Oh, yeah?

104
00:11:15,023 --> 00:11:17,190
- [Lola] Yeah.
- [woman] Muffins, huh?

105
00:11:17,192 --> 00:11:18,226
- [car honks]
- [Lola] Yes.

106
00:11:20,528 --> 00:11:22,728
[man] When you're on the right
wing, which is

107
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,297
- sometimes where you play, I know...
- [woman chuckles]

108
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:27,666
- ...you've gotta cross the ball...
- Hey, guys.

109
00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:29,035
- Oh, hello.
- [man] Hi.

110
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:30,770
Good. You started without me.

111
00:11:30,772 --> 00:11:34,272
When the roast comes out of the
oven, we eat.

112
00:11:34,274 --> 00:11:35,340
We're starving.

113
00:11:35,342 --> 00:11:37,310
Hey, trouble.

114
00:11:37,312 --> 00:11:40,479
You taking it easy
on Mom and Dad?

115
00:11:40,481 --> 00:11:43,549
- Yeah.
- [man] We'll talk tactics later, okay?

116
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:44,751
- [Thomas] Cool.
- [Lizzie sighs]

117
00:11:44,753 --> 00:11:46,051
There you go.

118
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:47,119
Oh, thanks.

119
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:48,286
Mm-hmm.

120
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:49,756
Hey, listen, um,

121
00:11:49,758 --> 00:11:51,491
can you
have Thomas tomorrow night?

122
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:53,028
Of course, <i>gumman.</i>

123
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:55,762
And what have you got on?

124
00:11:55,764 --> 00:11:57,597
Oh.

125
00:11:57,599 --> 00:12:01,235
I know it's kind of last minute,
but, um, I have a date.

126
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:06,108
- Oh. Like to stay tomorrow, Tommy?
- Yeah, sure.

127
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:10,609
Tell me, who is he?
How did you meet?

128
00:12:10,611 --> 00:12:13,579
Alice set it up.
It's just... It's just a date.

129
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:15,680
Mm. Really?

130
00:12:15,682 --> 00:12:17,552
Everything starts with a date.

131
00:12:18,552 --> 00:12:19,721
Good for you, Lizzie.

132
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:51,620
[doors lock]

133
00:13:57,217 --> 00:13:59,253
[Lola humming]

134
00:14:22,476 --> 00:14:23,876
- [Lola gasps]
- [Lizzie gasps]

135
00:14:23,878 --> 00:14:25,114
[gasps]

136
00:14:27,414 --> 00:14:28,549
[Lola] Mum!

137
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:31,486
Mummy!

138
00:14:39,927 --> 00:14:41,330
Mommy!

139
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,565
Mom!

140
00:14:46,801 --> 00:14:48,336
I've got you!

141
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,835
Hold onto me!

142
00:14:50,837 --> 00:14:52,240
Go away!

143
00:14:52,807 --> 00:14:54,773
I'm just trying to help!

144
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:55,807
No!

145
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:56,943
[echoing]

146
00:14:56,945 --> 00:14:59,214
[gasping, breathing heavily]

147
00:15:41,788 --> 00:15:43,824
[birds chirping]

148
00:16:08,349 --> 00:16:09,850
Do you want to
light the candles?

149
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,299
We need to remember her.

150
00:16:29,836 --> 00:16:30,871
[sighs]

151
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,309
[sighing]

152
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,433
Hi.

153
00:17:06,874 --> 00:17:08,908
Claire. It's Claire, right?

154
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,876
Yeah.
Sorry, I forget your name.

155
00:17:11,878 --> 00:17:14,646
Um, oh, Lizzie.
From Sam's birthday party.

156
00:17:14,648 --> 00:17:15,780
You saved my skirt.

157
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:18,683
- Oh, yes. Hi.
- Hi.

158
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:22,921
I saw this place listed online,
and I thought I'd check it out.

159
00:17:22,923 --> 00:17:26,394
- What a coincidence it's you.
- I know. [chuckles]

160
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,661
So you guys are leaving?

161
00:17:28,663 --> 00:17:30,962
[Claire] Yeah, I'm afraid so.

162
00:17:30,964 --> 00:17:32,931
We're moving
all the way over to Perth.

163
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:34,935
It's all happening really fast.

164
00:17:36,104 --> 00:17:37,471
Are you in the market?

165
00:17:38,806 --> 00:17:41,039
Well, I mean,
if the right thing comes around.

166
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,976
- Just love this neighborhood.
- Yeah, it's great.

167
00:17:43,978 --> 00:17:46,782
Thomas. I got the new <i>Act Of War.</i>
Wanna play?

168
00:17:48,115 --> 00:17:50,749
- Oh, Mom, please?
- Oh, Thomas, I'm sure they are...

169
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:52,884
It's totally fine.
He can stay and play.

170
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:55,688
- Oh, no, I don't wanna impose.
- Oh, it's okay.

171
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,526
It's like the planet's
arranging a play date.

172
00:17:58,159 --> 00:17:59,792
- Please, Mom?
- Can he?

173
00:17:59,794 --> 00:18:04,697
I mean, if it's no problem. I...

174
00:18:04,699 --> 00:18:08,066
Sure, why not? Um... But I won't stay,
though. I've got some errands to do.

175
00:18:08,068 --> 00:18:10,635
You go do them.
I'll keep my eye on these two.

176
00:18:10,637 --> 00:18:12,872
Okay, so what if I'm back in,
let's say, an hour?

177
00:18:12,874 --> 00:18:14,707
- Yeah, great. We'll be here.
- Okay.

178
00:18:14,709 --> 00:18:15,911
Let me take that, baby.

179
00:18:17,077 --> 00:18:18,811
- Have fun.
- I will. See ya, Mom.

180
00:18:18,813 --> 00:18:19,915
- Bye.
- Bye!

181
00:18:20,781 --> 00:18:22,783
[cutlery clattering]

182
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:38,066
[sirens wailing]

183
00:18:43,837 --> 00:18:45,539
[gasping]

184
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:18,170
- Hi.
- Hi.

185
00:19:18,172 --> 00:19:19,904
I hope he wasn't
too much trouble.

186
00:19:19,906 --> 00:19:22,810
Not at all.
Thomas, your mum's here!

187
00:19:26,513 --> 00:19:28,750
Hmm. Oh, wow.

188
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:30,915
Look at those ceilings.

189
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:32,750
I would totally invite you in,

190
00:19:32,752 --> 00:19:34,719
but I have to take Lola
to dance practice.

191
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:36,521
Oh, I didn't mean to impose...

192
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:38,524
If I wasn't in such a
rush, I would.

193
00:19:38,526 --> 00:19:40,726
I was just thinking
maybe I should

194
00:19:40,728 --> 00:19:42,661
bring my husband around,
to come and look at the place.

195
00:19:42,663 --> 00:19:44,162
- [footsteps approaching]
- [Thomas] Hey.

196
00:19:44,164 --> 00:19:45,965
Or should I
go through an agency, or...

197
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:48,601
Uh, no, no,
we can just go direct

198
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:49,802
if you're really interested.

199
00:19:49,804 --> 00:19:51,170
Yeah, that would be great.

200
00:19:51,172 --> 00:19:53,271
Okay, uh, why don't you

201
00:19:53,273 --> 00:19:56,875
put your number in my phone,
and I can text you some times

202
00:19:56,877 --> 00:19:58,142
- for later this week?
- Sure.

203
00:19:58,144 --> 00:19:59,745
- And bring Thomas.
- [beeping]

204
00:19:59,747 --> 00:20:01,881
He and Jeremy
had a terrific time.

205
00:20:01,883 --> 00:20:04,249
Don't forget your swimsuit.
You can test out the pool.

206
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:05,750
- Cool. Thank you.
- Yeah?

207
00:20:05,752 --> 00:20:07,920
- Thank you. See you.
- Bye.

208
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:09,191
- See you.
- Cool, see you.

209
00:20:14,261 --> 00:20:16,764
So you're half Swedish,
half English?

210
00:20:17,198 --> 00:20:18,930
Yeah.

211
00:20:18,932 --> 00:20:21,033
My mom is Swedish.
My dad is English.

212
00:20:21,035 --> 00:20:23,067
I grew up in Stockholm.

213
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:26,604
[chuckles] So how long
have you been single?

214
00:20:26,606 --> 00:20:30,744
Oh, I don't
think of myself that way.

215
00:20:32,246 --> 00:20:33,748
I thought you were...

216
00:20:34,781 --> 00:20:36,183
Oh, I am divorced.

217
00:20:36,951 --> 00:20:39,221
It's just, you know...

218
00:20:40,954 --> 00:20:44,759
I'm kind of still...
in the middle of it.

219
00:20:45,326 --> 00:20:47,058
I didn't mean to...

220
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,760
[sighs]
No, no, it's fine.

221
00:20:48,762 --> 00:20:50,764
I mean,
it's been a while. I...

222
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:54,769
I should, you know...

223
00:20:56,002 --> 00:20:57,038
move on.

224
00:20:59,073 --> 00:21:00,175
Mm-hmm.

225
00:21:04,311 --> 00:21:06,312
Did Alice tell you
I have children?

226
00:21:06,314 --> 00:21:07,779
Uh, she mentioned a son.

227
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:09,014
Yeah, Thomas.

228
00:21:09,016 --> 00:21:10,181
I'd like to meet him.

229
00:21:10,183 --> 00:21:11,819
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Uh...

230
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:13,721
Uh, you have another?

231
00:21:14,922 --> 00:21:16,258
No, just Thomas.

232
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:18,927
I thought
you said "children."

233
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,059
[chuckles]

234
00:21:21,061 --> 00:21:23,898
Thomas is a lot to handle,
believe me.

235
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:35,176
It's...

236
00:21:41,015 --> 00:21:46,688
As I said,
it's been a while since I...

237
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:52,826
socialized.

238
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:04,605
[breathing heavily]

239
00:22:42,977 --> 00:22:45,013
[moaning]

240
00:22:59,894 --> 00:23:01,895
Lizzie, let me look at you.

241
00:23:03,864 --> 00:23:04,966
Let me look at you.

242
00:23:10,104 --> 00:23:12,938
Look at me.
Let me look at you.

243
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,709
- Argh.
- [Lizzie] Stop! Stop.

244
00:23:25,352 --> 00:23:27,922
[continues moaning]

245
00:24:00,788 --> 00:24:02,824
[breathes heavily]

246
00:24:16,503 --> 00:24:17,738
Okay?

247
00:24:27,981 --> 00:24:30,018
[exhales, sniffles]

248
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,229
- I'm sorry.
- Lizzie, don't... What?

249
00:24:43,463 --> 00:24:46,300
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Did I do something wrong?

250
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:05,452
[knocking at door]

251
00:25:09,856 --> 00:25:10,988
- Hi.
- Hi.

252
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,224
Sorry,
we're a bit early.

253
00:25:12,226 --> 00:25:13,357
Oh, that's okay.
Come on in.

254
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,526
- Hi.
- Hi, Thomas.

255
00:25:14,528 --> 00:25:15,930
Jeremy's in the pool already.

256
00:25:16,596 --> 00:25:18,330
Where's your husband?

257
00:25:18,332 --> 00:25:21,466
Oh, he couldn't make it.
Last minute thing.

258
00:25:21,468 --> 00:25:23,468
That's too bad.

259
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,938
I guess we're the ones
that make the decisions anyway.

260
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,873
- Yeah.
- I'll show you the main part of the house,

261
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:32,143
but that's our au pair's room,
and bathroom here.

262
00:25:32,145 --> 00:25:34,982
- [children laughing]
- This is our piano room.

263
00:25:36,016 --> 00:25:37,051
Oh, wow.

264
00:25:38,051 --> 00:25:40,352
You've got great taste.

265
00:25:40,354 --> 00:25:43,158
We travel,
so I'm always picking things up.

266
00:25:46,926 --> 00:25:48,495
Living, dining.

267
00:25:49,896 --> 00:25:53,201
- The open plan was really important to us.
- Mmm.

268
00:25:54,934 --> 00:25:57,635
- [Lola] Is this better?
- [Claire] We put in the pool for the kids.

269
00:25:57,637 --> 00:26:00,007
It's a luxury, but we're hooked.

270
00:26:01,508 --> 00:26:03,107
Would you like to see upstairs?

271
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:04,144
Yeah.

272
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:10,282
So what do you do?

273
00:26:10,284 --> 00:26:12,450
I'm with Arlin Naturals.

274
00:26:12,452 --> 00:26:15,319
The one in Town Center.
I'm the manager.

275
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:16,356
Oh, nice.

276
00:26:22,563 --> 00:26:24,199
This is the master.

277
00:26:26,532 --> 00:26:28,035
Oh, it's beautiful.

278
00:26:28,602 --> 00:26:30,102
Do you like it? Your job?

279
00:26:30,104 --> 00:26:31,471
Yeah. I do.

280
00:26:32,405 --> 00:26:34,538
Spare room.
It's great for guests.

281
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,575
Mind you, sometimes I end up
in here if Bernie's snoring.

282
00:26:37,577 --> 00:26:38,879
[both chuckle]

283
00:26:40,681 --> 00:26:43,317
And this is Jeremy's room.

284
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:45,920
It's a bloody mess.

285
00:26:47,221 --> 00:26:49,257
- It'd be great for Thomas.
- Yeah.

286
00:27:00,534 --> 00:27:01,870
[chuckles]

287
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,404
Oh, I love this one.

288
00:27:06,205 --> 00:27:08,206
We were at my parents' house.
Jeremy was four.

289
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:09,941
[chuckles]

290
00:27:09,943 --> 00:27:13,981
God, I was huge,
and I was only six months pregnant there.

291
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,384
Do you have other kids?

292
00:27:18,117 --> 00:27:19,921
No, just Thomas.

293
00:27:29,128 --> 00:27:31,031
And this is Lola's room.

294
00:27:32,132 --> 00:27:34,602
There's plenty of space
for extra cupboards.

295
00:27:36,737 --> 00:27:38,236
[Lizzie] How old is she?

296
00:27:38,238 --> 00:27:40,238
She's seven.

297
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,074
- And already a full wardrobe.
- [children chattering]

298
00:27:43,076 --> 00:27:44,945
Girls will be girls, right?

299
00:27:46,346 --> 00:27:48,046
Is she okay with the move?

300
00:27:48,048 --> 00:27:51,549
Oh, yeah.
It's all she talks about.

301
00:27:51,551 --> 00:27:56,488
You know, Bernie told her there's a unicorn
petting zoo in Perth, so... [chuckles]

302
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:59,458
...now we've got a double trauma
coming up in the next couple of years

303
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,030
between Santa Claus
and now the unicorns.

304
00:28:04,498 --> 00:28:07,265
- [Bernard] Where are my monsters?
- Oh, speak of the devil.

305
00:28:07,267 --> 00:28:10,171
- It's the unicorn whisperer. Come and meet him.
- [Lola] Hi, Daddy!

306
00:28:13,374 --> 00:28:17,209
I know it sounds really silly,
but I really hope you buy the place.

307
00:28:17,211 --> 00:28:20,077
- It would be in good hands.
- [Lola giggling]

308
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:22,480
My God, this place
has been so good to us.

309
00:28:22,482 --> 00:28:24,382
Maybe it'll be good for you too.

310
00:28:24,384 --> 00:28:25,449
Yeah.

311
00:28:25,451 --> 00:28:26,718
- [Bernard] Hello.
- Hi.

312
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,553
Lola, say hi to Lizzie.

313
00:28:28,555 --> 00:28:30,521
- Hi.
- Hi.

314
00:28:30,523 --> 00:28:34,258
I watched you swim.
You're really good.

315
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,329
Thanks.

316
00:28:36,163 --> 00:28:38,529
- Buy it, Mum!
- [all laugh]

317
00:28:38,531 --> 00:28:40,766
Well, that settles it, then.
Meet the new owner.

318
00:28:40,768 --> 00:28:44,068
Well, we'll see, we'll see.
Um, can I use the loo?

319
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,106
- Yeah, down the hall on your left.
- Thanks.

320
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:50,374
What's your name, buster?

321
00:28:50,376 --> 00:28:52,076
Uh, Thomas.

322
00:28:52,078 --> 00:28:53,644
[Claire]
Now can I get you a drink?

323
00:28:53,646 --> 00:28:55,249
[Thomas]
Yes, please. Just water.

324
00:28:57,116 --> 00:29:00,687
[Claire] How was the pool?
Not too cold for you out there, is it?

325
00:29:06,192 --> 00:29:08,261
[breathing deeply]

326
00:29:50,537 --> 00:29:52,837
- [Claire] How many have you had today?
- [Jeremy] None!

327
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:55,207
- [all laughing]
- [Bernard] Put them back. We're on a budget, boys.

328
00:29:55,209 --> 00:29:58,477
Don't touch, okay?
Just chew on some celery.

329
00:29:58,479 --> 00:30:00,280
[Jeremy] Oh, come on, please!

330
00:30:15,561 --> 00:30:16,596
Hey.

331
00:30:19,165 --> 00:30:20,400
Can I come in?

332
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:22,502
Okay.

333
00:30:35,315 --> 00:30:36,350
Wow.

334
00:30:37,651 --> 00:30:39,287
You have such a nice room.

335
00:30:41,288 --> 00:30:42,690
Aren't you gonna miss it?

336
00:30:44,825 --> 00:30:46,727
- A little.
- Hmm.

337
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:53,468
Hey, I know.

338
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:20,394
Oh, look.

339
00:31:22,528 --> 00:31:23,564
What?

340
00:31:27,534 --> 00:31:29,403
Don't you think
we look alike?

341
00:31:36,442 --> 00:31:40,644
She seems great.
How long you two been friends?

342
00:31:40,646 --> 00:31:43,384
No, I barely know her.
The kids play soccer together.

343
00:31:44,718 --> 00:31:46,586
We could invite her
to stay for dinner.

344
00:31:47,788 --> 00:31:50,490
Yeah. We could.

345
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:54,793
I was kinda hoping we might
get the kids to bed early

346
00:31:54,795 --> 00:31:55,960
and have a date night.

347
00:31:55,962 --> 00:31:57,831
Thomas!
Time to go home!

348
00:31:59,365 --> 00:32:00,765
You have
the perfect layout.

349
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:02,400
- [Jeremy] Ask your mum.
- Thank you.

350
00:32:02,402 --> 00:32:04,869
Can I go ice-skating
on Wednesday with Jeremy?

351
00:32:04,871 --> 00:32:07,338
- Oh, Jeremy's obsessed.
- Please?

352
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,841
Baby, I think it's a family day.

353
00:32:09,843 --> 00:32:12,380
- No, no, it's fine.
- No, he can come. Of course.

354
00:32:14,314 --> 00:32:16,484
- You sure?
- Yeah, of course.

355
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:23,455
Okay, sure. Why not? Um, sounds like fun.
Go and get your stuff.

356
00:32:23,457 --> 00:32:24,922
[boys giggling]

357
00:32:24,924 --> 00:32:26,193
[Jeremy] Awesome.

358
00:32:27,827 --> 00:32:31,363
Thanks for showing me the house.
I'm seriously thinking about it.

359
00:32:31,365 --> 00:32:33,701
Well, we'd seriously
like you to buy it.

360
00:32:37,471 --> 00:32:39,804
[Lena] Tell us about your date.

361
00:32:39,806 --> 00:32:41,640
There's nothing to say.

362
00:32:41,642 --> 00:32:43,874
Well, are you
going to see him again?

363
00:32:43,876 --> 00:32:46,413
He was okay,
but nothing special.

364
00:32:47,513 --> 00:32:49,748
Trust me. For a woman
who married your father,

365
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,882
you don't need special.

366
00:32:50,884 --> 00:32:52,449
[chuckles]

367
00:32:52,451 --> 00:32:53,517
Very amusing.

368
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,555
[chuckles]

369
00:32:55,989 --> 00:32:59,724
It's just important
to have relationships in life.

370
00:32:59,726 --> 00:33:00,991
I know.

371
00:33:00,993 --> 00:33:03,594
You're either at that job

372
00:33:03,596 --> 00:33:05,462
or stuck in the apartment.

373
00:33:05,464 --> 00:33:07,465
It's not enough.

374
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:10,367
We're gonna buy my friend's
house, so we won't be stuck.

375
00:33:10,369 --> 00:33:12,903
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

376
00:33:12,905 --> 00:33:17,374
Yeah, I was just looking around,
seeing what's out there.

377
00:33:17,376 --> 00:33:21,746
- Sure.
- It's big. Really big. And there's a pool.

378
00:33:21,748 --> 00:33:23,918
We used to do that.
Window shop.

379
00:33:26,752 --> 00:33:29,624
Yeah, I know I can't afford
it, but it's fun to look.

380
00:33:32,025 --> 00:33:33,928
You... You said
we might buy it.

381
00:33:34,994 --> 00:33:36,728
Yeah, maybe one day, baby.

382
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:37,932
You're such a liar!

383
00:33:39,098 --> 00:33:42,499
Thomas. That's enough.

384
00:33:42,501 --> 00:33:45,272
I hate the apartment.
I can hear you clean your teeth.

385
00:33:45,939 --> 00:33:47,738
And I can hear you pee.
So what?

386
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,477
And I can hear you cry
all the time.

387
00:33:54,413 --> 00:33:57,614
- I wanna live with Dad.
- [Lizzie] Thomas.

388
00:33:57,616 --> 00:33:59,918
You're always saying you'll get
things done which you never do.

389
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,519
Oh, that's not true.
You know that's not true.

390
00:34:02,521 --> 00:34:04,088
Yes, it is.
And you're always sad.

391
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:06,490
I'm not sad.
I'm not fucking sad.

392
00:34:06,492 --> 00:34:09,860
- Lizzie.
- I'm getting it done, okay? I'm getting it done.

393
00:34:09,862 --> 00:34:11,563
You never get anything done!

394
00:34:11,565 --> 00:34:12,896
- [Lena] Now now.
- [Carl] Come back here!

395
00:34:12,898 --> 00:34:14,099
- Dad!
- Control him!

396
00:34:14,101 --> 00:34:15,967
- [door slams]
- It's okay, baby!

397
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:17,871
It's not okay.
And you shouldn't be swearing at him.

398
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:22,442
[scoffs]

399
00:34:25,144 --> 00:34:27,414
- [sniffling]
- [door opens]

400
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:34,822
[sighs]

401
00:34:37,757 --> 00:34:39,826
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about the house.

402
00:34:40,827 --> 00:34:44,465
I got excited,
and it was a dumb idea.

403
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,869
I thought
we were gonna live there.

404
00:34:52,606 --> 00:34:53,741
I'm sorry, baby.

405
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:56,677
I...

406
00:34:59,146 --> 00:35:01,782
I know I'm not always
the best mom.

407
00:35:04,951 --> 00:35:09,657
But, um...
there's just a lot going on now.

408
00:35:10,157 --> 00:35:11,759
And I'm doing my best.

409
00:35:13,893 --> 00:35:15,495
I'm doing my best, baby.

410
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:20,768
I love you.

411
00:35:27,507 --> 00:35:29,510
I love you so much,
baby.

412
00:35:32,813 --> 00:35:34,849
When you hurt,
I hurt too.

413
00:35:42,588 --> 00:35:44,023
I wanna live with Dad.

414
00:35:45,826 --> 00:35:49,429
Well, you do.
Half the time.

415
00:35:51,197 --> 00:35:53,063
Not like that.

416
00:35:53,065 --> 00:35:55,066
Baby, we're gonna
work it out.

417
00:35:55,068 --> 00:35:56,403
It's gonna be okay.

418
00:35:58,505 --> 00:35:59,573
It's not.

419
00:36:08,181 --> 00:36:09,817
Go and get your stuff, baby.

420
00:36:11,918 --> 00:36:13,086
[Lena] <i>Gumman.</i>

421
00:36:15,088 --> 00:36:16,123
I'm fine.

422
00:36:18,123 --> 00:36:19,526
[Lena speaking Swedish]

423
00:36:24,664 --> 00:36:25,866
I don't know why.

424
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:29,800
I just feel so fuck...

425
00:36:29,802 --> 00:36:30,869
[exhales sharply]

426
00:36:30,871 --> 00:36:32,836
Oh...

427
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:36,643
<i>Älskling,</i> you don't
seem to be... coping.

428
00:36:37,744 --> 00:36:39,776
Because before when you were...

429
00:36:39,778 --> 00:36:41,579
Stop treating me
like a child, okay?

430
00:36:41,581 --> 00:36:44,452
- I'm an adult.
- Of course you are.

431
00:36:46,253 --> 00:36:47,988
I just had a moment.

432
00:36:48,688 --> 00:36:50,255
We're just concerned.

433
00:36:50,257 --> 00:36:52,856
Just stop fucking being
concerned about me all the time!

434
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:54,858
It's driving me crazy!

435
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,896
For Christ's sake, Lizzie,
this isn't just about you!

436
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,699
You have a son.

437
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,932
Because you're on edge
all the time,

438
00:37:00,934 --> 00:37:02,800
you're bad-tempered with him,

439
00:37:02,802 --> 00:37:04,137
you're forgetful.

440
00:37:05,271 --> 00:37:08,041
It isn't a healthy
environment for a child.

441
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:13,213
[sighs] We thought
you were doing better.

442
00:37:16,081 --> 00:37:19,519
Well...
[exhales sharply] ...so did I.

443
00:37:23,155 --> 00:37:25,192
[soft music playing]

444
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:36,769
My parents just called.
Thomas is sick.

445
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,873
[scoffs]

446
00:37:39,773 --> 00:37:42,710
Really? Well,
what does he have?

447
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,778
Or is he just plain sick?

448
00:37:46,813 --> 00:37:48,746
He's vomiting
and has a fever.

449
00:37:48,748 --> 00:37:50,847
I'm sorry,
but I really gotta go.

450
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:52,182
[scoffs]

451
00:37:52,184 --> 00:37:53,851
For God's sake, Courtney,

452
00:37:53,853 --> 00:37:55,222
her kid is sick.
Just let her go.

453
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:01,925
She can go.
Of course she can go.

454
00:38:01,927 --> 00:38:03,563
Thanks,
I appreciate it.

455
00:38:08,668 --> 00:38:10,668
[children chattering]

456
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,805
[Claire]
He skates well.

457
00:38:13,306 --> 00:38:15,543
He comes
with his dad sometimes.

458
00:38:19,144 --> 00:38:22,880
Jeremy is not... bad.

459
00:38:22,882 --> 00:38:25,653
Oh, he tries.
[chuckles]

460
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:34,628
How long
have you lived here?

461
00:38:35,762 --> 00:38:36,931
About ten years.

462
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:41,835
So they're both born here?

463
00:38:42,902 --> 00:38:46,005
Uh, yeah. Yeah,
both at Landry Maternity.

464
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:48,976
- [phone ringing]
- Oh, excuse me.

465
00:38:49,742 --> 00:38:50,911
Hi, Mum.

466
00:38:52,211 --> 00:38:53,980
Yeah, we're just
at the ice skating rink.

467
00:38:56,248 --> 00:38:57,750
Yeah,
they're doing well.

468
00:39:01,253 --> 00:39:04,088
Oh, yeah, we'll be over
on the weekend for sure.

469
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,958
- Yeah, we can bring some more.
- [Thomas] Come on, Lola.

470
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,797
[Claire] How about one o'clock?
Yeah, we can't wait to see you.

471
00:39:19,405 --> 00:39:20,641
Hey.

472
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:24,811
[chuckles]

473
00:39:28,248 --> 00:39:30,717
No, no, I only just started
packing the kitchen.

474
00:39:36,188 --> 00:39:38,255
Yeah, I only just
got a few boxes.

475
00:39:38,257 --> 00:39:40,793
If you bend your knees a little
bit, you'll get steadier.

476
00:39:44,931 --> 00:39:46,199
- [Lizzie gasps]
- [Lola giggles]

477
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,135
Want to hold my hand?

478
00:39:55,307 --> 00:39:58,045
Okay. Let's speed up.

479
00:40:02,981 --> 00:40:04,182
[giggles]

480
00:40:04,184 --> 00:40:05,686
Keep looking ahead.

481
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,064
Should we try something?
You go in front.

482
00:40:35,514 --> 00:40:37,347
[gasps] No!

483
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:39,117
[Lizzie gasps]

484
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,688
Shit!

485
00:40:42,088 --> 00:40:43,157
Lola!

486
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:46,891
- [gasps]
- Lola!

487
00:40:46,893 --> 00:40:48,695
- [Lizzie] Oh, my God.
- No, don't... Don't touch her.

488
00:40:50,496 --> 00:40:52,965
Are you okay?
Are you okay, honey?

489
00:40:53,867 --> 00:40:55,465
- [groans]
- [Lizzie] I'm so sorry.

490
00:40:55,467 --> 00:40:58,135
- Shh. It's okay. It's okay.
- Is she okay?

491
00:40:58,137 --> 00:41:00,838
The guy just shot out of nowhere.
Such an idiot.

492
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,043
You were obviously
going too fast.

493
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,878
[panting]

494
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:08,981
It's just a bump.
It's just a bump, honey.

495
00:41:16,822 --> 00:41:18,826
I am so, so sorry.

496
00:41:22,128 --> 00:41:25,999
You have a tough little
trooper right there.

497
00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:32,371
I wanna make it up to you guys.

498
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,776
No, it's fine.
It's okay.

499
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:41,112
Um, I can take them off
your hands this weekend.

500
00:41:41,114 --> 00:41:42,750
I'm with Dad this weekend.

501
00:41:47,152 --> 00:41:49,322
Or any weekday afternoon.

502
00:41:53,393 --> 00:41:56,327
Um, you know, they have
so much going on already

503
00:41:56,329 --> 00:41:57,998
with the move
and everything, so...

504
00:41:59,565 --> 00:42:03,102
Sure.
Whatever works best for you.

505
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:07,240
Yeah, we can...

506
00:42:08,507 --> 00:42:09,976
We'll just play it by ear.

507
00:42:11,143 --> 00:42:13,780
Come on, Jeremy.
You ready? Let's go.

508
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,215
- Okay, see you.
- See you later.

509
00:42:25,557 --> 00:42:27,391
[exhales sharply]

510
00:42:27,393 --> 00:42:29,128
[whimpering]

511
00:42:59,092 --> 00:43:01,128
[toilet flushes]

512
00:43:17,043 --> 00:43:18,878
[man] How's your day-to-day?

513
00:43:21,581 --> 00:43:22,983
Much better.

514
00:43:24,317 --> 00:43:26,052
I try to relax more.

515
00:43:30,023 --> 00:43:34,894
The other day I played hooky from work.
I went ice skating with Thomas.

516
00:43:36,028 --> 00:43:40,630
[man chuckles] Well,
your secret is safe with me.

517
00:43:40,632 --> 00:43:42,034
[chuckles]

518
00:43:44,137 --> 00:43:45,505
[man]
And how are you both doing?

519
00:43:47,572 --> 00:43:48,608
He's great.

520
00:43:52,577 --> 00:43:53,880
[man]
I mean the two of you.

521
00:43:56,148 --> 00:44:00,219
Yeah, you know,
we're, uh, we're good.

522
00:44:01,521 --> 00:44:03,223
We're...
We're doing great.

523
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:05,925
[man] Good.

524
00:44:10,195 --> 00:44:13,900
So do you find yourself
thinking less about Rosie?

525
00:44:20,172 --> 00:44:24,644
Mm, yeah.
Yeah, less and less.

526
00:44:25,677 --> 00:44:28,614
[man]
And the medication.

527
00:44:30,615 --> 00:44:32,052
Do you feel it's helping?

528
00:44:33,418 --> 00:44:35,221
Absolutely. Yeah.

529
00:44:52,405 --> 00:44:55,238
- All right, that one's definitely coming.
- [giggles] Yeah.

530
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,208
Care Bear. Still coming?

531
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:01,045
- Yeah.
- All right. What about Mr. Dinosaur?

532
00:45:01,047 --> 00:45:02,679
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Are you sure?

533
00:45:02,681 --> 00:45:04,280
- I don't know!
- Yeah.

534
00:45:04,282 --> 00:45:06,217
[both laugh]

535
00:45:06,219 --> 00:45:07,954
You have too many toys.

536
00:45:16,561 --> 00:45:19,229
Lola, can you grab me a glass of
water from the kitchen, please?

537
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,266
Yeah.

538
00:45:49,628 --> 00:45:51,664
[chattering]

539
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:55,298
- [woman] Just turn around.
- [girl] It's so tight...

540
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,767
[woman 2] Need a couple
more pins in there.

541
00:45:57,769 --> 00:45:59,206
[girl 2] Mom, that's enough.

542
00:46:00,606 --> 00:46:02,743
You look like a real ballerina.

543
00:46:06,112 --> 00:46:07,681
I'm a bit scared,
Mum.

544
00:46:08,614 --> 00:46:11,715
Well, it's okay
to be a bit scared.

545
00:46:11,717 --> 00:46:15,119
But look, all the other girls
don't seem nervous.

546
00:46:15,121 --> 00:46:16,256
Well, I am.

547
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:22,159
Well, I'll tell you what.
I'm going to be sitting in the audience,

548
00:46:22,161 --> 00:46:24,595
- cheering you on with your dad and with Jezzy, yeah?
- [bell rings]

549
00:46:24,597 --> 00:46:26,396
- [woman] Come on, girls!
- [girl] Oh, let's go.

550
00:46:26,398 --> 00:46:28,199
Okay, go on. Go on.

551
00:46:28,201 --> 00:46:30,133
No, stay with me.

552
00:46:30,135 --> 00:46:32,369
But look,
all the other mums are going.

553
00:46:32,371 --> 00:46:33,740
[woman] Right, off you go.
Go get 'em.

554
00:46:38,478 --> 00:46:41,612
You are going to be
so amazing, yeah?

555
00:46:41,614 --> 00:46:43,613
You're my brave girl,
and you're going to be great,

556
00:46:43,615 --> 00:46:46,383
and then we're going to be with
you right afterwards, yeah?

557
00:46:46,385 --> 00:46:47,421
Okay, go on.

558
00:46:48,454 --> 00:46:50,557
Come on! Let's go.

559
00:46:54,427 --> 00:46:56,463
[ballet music playing]

560
00:47:03,668 --> 00:47:07,537
[whispering] Oh, excuse me.
Sorry. Sorry.

561
00:47:07,539 --> 00:47:09,608
- She all right?
- Yeah, she's fine.

562
00:47:17,682 --> 00:47:18,818
Oh, my God.

563
00:47:30,396 --> 00:47:31,461
[gasps]

564
00:47:31,463 --> 00:47:32,498
Hey, Lola.

565
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,135
You okay?

566
00:47:38,905 --> 00:47:40,307
Wow.

567
00:47:41,306 --> 00:47:42,773
Oh, your shoes.

568
00:47:42,775 --> 00:47:44,211
They're so pretty.

569
00:47:45,811 --> 00:47:48,811
- I got them for my birthday.
- Really?

570
00:47:48,813 --> 00:47:49,815
Hmm.

571
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:52,285
When is your birthday?

572
00:47:53,719 --> 00:47:55,255
I'm on next.

573
00:47:56,355 --> 00:47:57,655
[Lizzie] Don't be scared.

574
00:47:57,657 --> 00:47:59,126
[gasps]

575
00:47:59,858 --> 00:48:01,161
I'm here.

576
00:48:09,969 --> 00:48:11,737
[chuckles]

577
00:48:30,755 --> 00:48:32,291
[mouthing]

578
00:48:37,463 --> 00:48:38,598
What's she doing?

579
00:49:52,972 --> 00:49:55,575
[applause]

580
00:50:00,746 --> 00:50:02,249
- I'll get Lola.
- Okay.

581
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,588
[panting]

582
00:50:16,795 --> 00:50:19,563
[chattering]

583
00:50:19,565 --> 00:50:21,097
[woman] Do you think
I should go back there?

584
00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:22,633
I would definitely.

585
00:50:22,635 --> 00:50:24,534
It'd be good
to get up there again.

586
00:50:24,536 --> 00:50:25,735
- Hi. Sorry.
- Hi, sweetheart.

587
00:50:25,737 --> 00:50:27,273
Um, she's not backstage.

588
00:50:28,007 --> 00:50:31,278
Well, she's...
She'll be somewhere.

589
00:50:31,876 --> 00:50:33,976
Okay, I'll be back.
Sorry.

590
00:50:33,978 --> 00:50:35,014
No worries.

591
00:50:36,548 --> 00:50:38,581
Yeah, so I mean,
he did an incredible job for us.

592
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:40,550
- [woman] It's probably not the best time.
- [Bernard] No, no.

593
00:50:40,552 --> 00:50:42,588
I mean, it's hard,
you know? Especially...

594
00:50:43,489 --> 00:50:44,655
Sorry,
would you excuse me?

595
00:50:44,657 --> 00:50:47,294
Lizzie! Hi.

596
00:50:48,027 --> 00:50:49,126
- Hi.
- [Bernard] How are you?

597
00:50:49,128 --> 00:50:50,626
Yeah, I'm good.

598
00:50:50,628 --> 00:50:53,496
Good. So you...

599
00:50:53,498 --> 00:50:55,334
you decided against the house?

600
00:50:55,967 --> 00:50:58,401
Yeah. Yeah,
we ran the numbers

601
00:50:58,403 --> 00:51:00,403
and just can't
swing the mortgage.

602
00:51:00,405 --> 00:51:03,407
- Right. Yeah.
- I'm so disappointed.

603
00:51:03,409 --> 00:51:05,708
- I love it. I got carried away.
- Oh.

604
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:07,644
I feel so embarrassed.

605
00:51:07,646 --> 00:51:09,979
No, don't be embarrassed.
It's understandable.

606
00:51:09,981 --> 00:51:12,148
You know, it's life.

607
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:15,952
Erm, we're actually having
a going away party,

608
00:51:15,954 --> 00:51:17,521
if you were interested.

609
00:51:17,523 --> 00:51:20,124
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.
- Saturday week.

610
00:51:20,126 --> 00:51:23,494
- It should go on till quite late. Should be fun.
- Yeah.

611
00:51:23,496 --> 00:51:27,063
- Princess! Here she is!
- [Lola giggling]

612
00:51:27,065 --> 00:51:30,833
Oh, yes!
I'm so proud of you.

613
00:51:30,835 --> 00:51:32,068
[Lola] Did you like it?

614
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:35,472
You were so good,
my love.

615
00:51:35,474 --> 00:51:37,907
[Claire]
You were so great. So good.

616
00:51:37,909 --> 00:51:40,744
- [Lola] Really? I was so nervous.
- Mmm.

617
00:51:40,746 --> 00:51:42,445
[Bernard laughs]

618
00:51:42,447 --> 00:51:43,813
Hi.

619
00:51:43,815 --> 00:51:45,784
Hi. We meet again.

620
00:51:47,085 --> 00:51:48,684
Is Thomas with you?

621
00:51:48,686 --> 00:51:51,458
I've gotta go
and pick him up now.

622
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:54,527
Do you know someone here?

623
00:51:57,663 --> 00:52:00,967
I just love ballet.
And you were amazing.

624
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,902
Did you see me
looking over at you?

625
00:52:06,172 --> 00:52:07,474
Mm-hmm.

626
00:52:10,842 --> 00:52:13,677
- I've gotta go.
- Sure.

627
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:15,014
- [Lizzie] Bye.
- See you.

628
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,653
That was odd.

629
00:52:23,655 --> 00:52:26,592
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

630
00:52:28,994 --> 00:52:30,760
You were so wonderful.

631
00:52:30,762 --> 00:52:32,563
You were so good.

632
00:52:32,565 --> 00:52:34,898
- Is somebody starving?
- [Lola] Yeah.

633
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,137
- Starving to death?
- [Lola giggles] Yeah.

634
00:52:38,971 --> 00:52:41,007
[soft music playing]

635
00:52:42,708 --> 00:52:43,876
Okay.

636
00:52:48,179 --> 00:52:51,648
Wow, you have amazing skin.

637
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:52,852
Great.

638
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:00,427
[Claire] Can we talk?

639
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:05,130
Sure. Now?

640
00:53:06,532 --> 00:53:07,767
Preferably, yes.

641
00:53:11,237 --> 00:53:14,838
All right. Alice?

642
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,443
- Mm-hmm.
- Cover things for a few minutes?

643
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:51,110
You never intended
on buying the house.

644
00:53:58,583 --> 00:54:00,018
I'm trying to work it out.

645
00:54:02,721 --> 00:54:04,023
Work out what?

646
00:54:11,329 --> 00:54:14,132
I lost my baby daughter
seven years ago.

647
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:23,876
I didn't know.
I'm... I'm sorry.

648
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:27,881
She died.

649
00:54:29,748 --> 00:54:30,983
In a fire.

650
00:54:33,918 --> 00:54:35,721
At Bryant Hospital.

651
00:54:39,123 --> 00:54:40,859
Why are you telling me this?

652
00:54:43,295 --> 00:54:48,034
Because every time I see Lola,
I'm more convinced.

653
00:54:49,835 --> 00:54:51,538
Convinced of what?

654
00:54:51,971 --> 00:54:54,170
[breathes shakily]

655
00:54:54,172 --> 00:54:57,042
I'm pretty sure
she's my daughter.

656
00:54:58,010 --> 00:54:59,278
[scoffs]

657
00:55:02,748 --> 00:55:05,148
[scoffs]
That's crazy.

658
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:08,952
Hmm? You can't deny
that she looks like me.

659
00:55:08,954 --> 00:55:11,291
You think
Lola is your daughter?

660
00:55:13,759 --> 00:55:16,262
And what brings you
to that conclusion?

661
00:55:18,731 --> 00:55:20,233
I just feel it.

662
00:55:22,134 --> 00:55:23,700
I think you have a problem.

663
00:55:23,702 --> 00:55:25,235
Something happened.

664
00:55:25,237 --> 00:55:27,574
No. No, I don't
want to hear anymore.

665
00:55:28,373 --> 00:55:31,307
This is nuts.
You know that, don't you?

666
00:55:31,309 --> 00:55:34,945
At the hospital, in the
fire, in the confusion...

667
00:55:34,947 --> 00:55:37,414
Look, I'm sure that whatever
happened to you was very painful,

668
00:55:37,416 --> 00:55:39,085
but Lola is my daughter.

669
00:55:43,155 --> 00:55:46,225
[exhales sharply] I can't
believe I just had to say that.

670
00:55:51,329 --> 00:55:52,896
I don't know
about that hospital,

671
00:55:52,898 --> 00:55:54,701
and I don't know
about any fire.

672
00:55:55,701 --> 00:55:58,338
Okay? Lola was born
at Landry Maternity.

673
00:56:00,972 --> 00:56:03,710
I'm very sorry for your loss,
but I can't help you.

674
00:56:09,347 --> 00:56:10,782
I think
you need therapy.

675
00:56:16,288 --> 00:56:18,925
I don't think our boys
should play together anymore.

676
00:56:25,431 --> 00:56:28,735
And you need to stay away
from my family.

677
00:56:41,346 --> 00:56:43,382
[crying]

678
00:56:48,086 --> 00:56:49,853
[Bernard] I don't think
that proves anything.

679
00:56:49,855 --> 00:56:51,420
Susan doesn't spread gossip.

680
00:56:51,422 --> 00:56:53,389
She said it wasn't
just a little time off.

681
00:56:53,391 --> 00:56:56,459
She said Lizzie was
committed for almost a year.

682
00:56:56,461 --> 00:56:59,132
Yeah, but my love,
she lost a baby.

683
00:56:59,898 --> 00:57:00,932
Imagine.

684
00:57:02,134 --> 00:57:03,670
No, I can't imagine it.

685
00:57:06,105 --> 00:57:07,807
I think we should
call the police.

686
00:57:10,108 --> 00:57:14,010
Look, the point is,
there's no law against being crazy, okay?

687
00:57:14,012 --> 00:57:16,045
People can say
whatever they wanna say.

688
00:57:16,047 --> 00:57:20,085
I need you to hear me.
She is stalking our family.

689
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,887
Looking through our front gate

690
00:57:24,889 --> 00:57:30,395
when we've got a "for sale" sign
up out there is not stalking.

691
00:57:31,362 --> 00:57:32,762
Come on.
And, you know,

692
00:57:32,764 --> 00:57:36,032
the other places,
the... the ice skating,

693
00:57:36,034 --> 00:57:37,867
I mean,
you invited her to that.

694
00:57:37,869 --> 00:57:40,369
And the ballet?
They're public places.

695
00:57:40,371 --> 00:57:42,037
None of it
constitutes stalking.

696
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:43,807
The cops are not going to
do anything about it.

697
00:57:43,809 --> 00:57:45,441
So we're just
supposed to do nothing?

698
00:57:45,443 --> 00:57:48,411
No, we don't do nothing.
We just don't overreact.

699
00:57:48,413 --> 00:57:49,512
I'm not overreacting.

700
00:57:49,514 --> 00:57:50,982
You are.

701
00:57:52,483 --> 00:57:57,320
We lock the doors.
We put the alarm on.

702
00:57:57,322 --> 00:57:58,921
[children giggling]

703
00:57:58,923 --> 00:58:02,295
Darling, it's okay.

704
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,934
[softly] Okay.

705
00:58:17,309 --> 00:58:19,345
- [soft music playing]
- [chattering]

706
00:58:20,545 --> 00:58:22,748
You walked out
on a shift.

707
00:58:23,548 --> 00:58:25,514
Best of luck
for your future endeavors.

708
00:58:25,516 --> 00:58:27,516
Thanks.

709
00:58:27,518 --> 00:58:29,921
Let's hope you're a better
parent than you are an employee.

710
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:36,496
[gasps]

711
00:58:42,201 --> 00:58:43,802
You're hurting me.

712
00:58:46,271 --> 00:58:47,406
[groans]

713
00:58:56,047 --> 00:58:57,149
[Alice]
Lizzie, come on.

714
00:59:00,918 --> 00:59:01,985
[sighs]

715
00:59:01,987 --> 00:59:04,023
[inaudible]

716
00:59:06,592 --> 00:59:09,959
[Lizzie] Okay, so that's done.
What else can I do for you?

717
00:59:09,961 --> 00:59:12,362
Uh, could you grab
some more buns, please?

718
00:59:12,364 --> 00:59:14,164
- Yeah, sure.
- And some veggie burgers?

719
00:59:14,166 --> 00:59:16,233
- Okay, you got it.
- Thank you.

720
00:59:16,235 --> 00:59:18,271
[children chattering, laughing]

721
01:00:02,246 --> 01:00:03,449
[gasps]

722
01:00:09,186 --> 01:00:13,523
Hey, thanks for looking after the kids.
It's officially madness here.

723
01:00:13,525 --> 01:00:16,693
- [woman] <i>Okay then, no worries. We're coping.</i>
- How are they doing?

724
01:00:16,695 --> 01:00:20,329
Well, they are loading up on sugar.
You'll have fun tonight.

725
01:00:20,331 --> 01:00:23,333
[Claire] <i>Oh. Well, you make sure they
eat a burger or something, will you?</i>

726
01:00:23,335 --> 01:00:26,702
- [Ellen] <i>Yeah.</i>
- Actually, are they handy? Can I say hi?

727
01:00:26,704 --> 01:00:29,505
Uh, well, Jeremy's playing
soccer with his friends,

728
01:00:29,507 --> 01:00:31,708
and Lola went for a walk
with your friend.

729
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:37,213
- My friend?
- [Ellen] <i>Yeah. The nice one. Lizzie.</i>

730
01:00:37,215 --> 01:00:39,385
- What?
- <i>She was gonna buy your house.</i>

731
01:00:40,485 --> 01:00:42,151
Wait, is that...
is that okay?

732
01:00:42,153 --> 01:00:45,123
No.
Um, no, it's not okay.

733
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:47,356
She seems really nice.

734
01:00:47,358 --> 01:00:49,458
[Claire]
<i>Listen, I'm coming, okay?</i>

735
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:51,260
Claire, I'm sure it's fine.

736
01:00:51,262 --> 01:00:52,729
<i>Um, do you want me to...</i>

737
01:00:52,731 --> 01:00:55,001
Yes. No. Uh... Fuck.

738
01:00:55,701 --> 01:00:58,568
Look, uh,
I'll handle it, okay?

739
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:00,539
I can't believe you let her
go on a walk with her.

740
01:01:13,518 --> 01:01:14,619
Do you wanna know a secret?

741
01:01:19,523 --> 01:01:21,393
I had
a little girl once.

742
01:01:22,728 --> 01:01:24,163
A little baby.

743
01:01:27,032 --> 01:01:28,601
What happened to her?

744
01:01:32,237 --> 01:01:33,405
She...

745
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:38,009
She was in an accident.

746
01:01:50,389 --> 01:01:52,057
I loved her very much.

747
01:01:58,764 --> 01:02:01,133
[sighing]

748
01:02:03,235 --> 01:02:04,603
Do you love your mommy?

749
01:02:11,309 --> 01:02:12,611
She loves you too.

750
01:02:17,715 --> 01:02:19,184
Oh, shit.

751
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:22,684
Come on, fucking move!

752
01:02:22,686 --> 01:02:25,324
[honking]

753
01:02:27,592 --> 01:02:29,161
[tires screeching]

754
01:02:32,097 --> 01:02:33,466
Do you know what this is?

755
01:02:37,235 --> 01:02:38,704
It's the mark of an angel.

756
01:02:43,442 --> 01:02:45,710
When the baby
is in its mommy's womb...

757
01:02:47,112 --> 01:02:48,610
it knows all the answers

758
01:02:48,612 --> 01:02:50,648
to all the mysteries
in the whole world.

759
01:02:53,117 --> 01:02:55,485
Then, just before it's born,

760
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:59,692
an angel places its finger
on the baby's mouth.

761
01:03:00,659 --> 01:03:02,294
Shh.

762
01:03:05,163 --> 01:03:07,333
And the child
forgets everything.

763
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,637
That's why we've all got
this little indent.

764
01:03:17,175 --> 01:03:18,244
Yes.

765
01:03:20,144 --> 01:03:21,447
That's it. [laughs]

766
01:03:27,219 --> 01:03:29,121
All the answers
are in us.

767
01:03:30,889 --> 01:03:36,195
But we have to be very quiet
and very still to remember them.

768
01:03:57,715 --> 01:03:59,085
Do you remember me?

769
01:04:17,668 --> 01:04:19,704
[breathing shakily]

770
01:04:25,809 --> 01:04:28,413
[panting]

771
01:04:30,648 --> 01:04:32,916
[children clamoring]

772
01:04:32,918 --> 01:04:34,316
[Ellen] There you go.

773
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:36,619
- Hi. Where is she?
- Hey!

774
01:04:36,621 --> 01:04:38,921
Uh, she's around here
somewhere.

775
01:04:38,923 --> 01:04:41,126
- Where?
- She just came back.

776
01:04:44,563 --> 01:04:46,396
Oh, there she is.

777
01:04:46,398 --> 01:04:48,463
God, sorry.
You must think I'm mad.

778
01:04:48,465 --> 01:04:52,401
Not at all, I'm so sorry.
She seemed really nice.

779
01:04:52,403 --> 01:04:53,936
- Hi.
- Hi.

780
01:04:53,938 --> 01:04:56,706
- Are you good?
- Uh-huh.

781
01:04:56,708 --> 01:04:58,441
What have you been doing?

782
01:04:58,443 --> 01:05:00,412
I went on a boat ride
with Lizzie.

783
01:05:02,947 --> 01:05:04,716
Oh. Right.

784
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:07,219
Um...

785
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:13,159
What did...
What did you talk about?

786
01:05:15,827 --> 01:05:17,163
Angels.

787
01:05:17,862 --> 01:05:19,798
Angels. Okay.

788
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:25,304
Did you talk about
anything else?

789
01:05:27,938 --> 01:05:29,274
Babies.

790
01:05:30,574 --> 01:05:31,676
Babies.

791
01:05:33,945 --> 01:05:35,247
Um...

792
01:05:36,014 --> 01:05:40,486
Honey, did she...

793
01:05:41,385 --> 01:05:42,755
Did she touch you at all?

794
01:05:47,425 --> 01:05:48,460
No.

795
01:05:49,293 --> 01:05:50,461
You sure?

796
01:05:52,297 --> 01:05:55,201
Yeah? Okay.

797
01:05:56,635 --> 01:05:59,369
- And you talked about angels?
- Yeah.

798
01:05:59,371 --> 01:06:00,739
Right, well, that's nice.

799
01:06:04,476 --> 01:06:05,611
I'm here.

800
01:06:07,878 --> 01:06:11,317
I had to cover at work. Sorry.

801
01:06:13,018 --> 01:06:14,320
Hello, Lizzie.

802
01:06:16,721 --> 01:06:20,659
What are you doing here?
And what are you doing here?

803
01:06:21,626 --> 01:06:22,828
The school called me.

804
01:06:24,996 --> 01:06:27,463
You didn't pick me up
from soccer practice.

805
01:06:27,465 --> 01:06:28,731
[Lizzie sighs]

806
01:06:28,733 --> 01:06:30,568
Tommy, why don't you
go upstairs?

807
01:06:31,536 --> 01:06:33,472
All right? Go on.

808
01:06:34,338 --> 01:06:35,873
I'm so sorry, baby.

809
01:06:43,681 --> 01:06:45,483
- [door closes]
- [ex-husband] Lizzie.

810
01:06:47,585 --> 01:06:49,288
You know things have to change.

811
01:06:50,487 --> 01:06:51,820
Thomas is at an age. He just...

812
01:06:51,822 --> 01:06:54,057
It was a work emergency.

813
01:06:54,059 --> 01:06:56,262
There's always
an excuse, Lizzie.

814
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:00,599
Mom?

815
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:02,668
Dad?

816
01:07:03,568 --> 01:07:05,400
Come on!

817
01:07:05,402 --> 01:07:07,305
You know things are better.

818
01:07:08,873 --> 01:07:12,541
Lizzie, we all
care about you.

819
01:07:12,543 --> 01:07:14,879
- We want to support your healing process.
- Oh, God.

820
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:18,481
We feel that your best chance
for full recovery

821
01:07:18,483 --> 01:07:21,287
will come with the benefit
of another inpatient program.

822
01:07:22,487 --> 01:07:23,885
It's only temporary.

823
01:07:23,887 --> 01:07:25,290
[sighs]

824
01:07:27,057 --> 01:07:30,561
I mean, I... I'm...
[stutters]

825
01:07:34,465 --> 01:07:36,501
What about Thomas?
What about work?

826
01:07:39,436 --> 01:07:43,409
Alice called.
She told us you lost your job.

827
01:07:44,509 --> 01:07:46,909
[laughs] What?

828
01:07:46,911 --> 01:07:49,512
She called you?
She fucking called you?

829
01:07:49,514 --> 01:07:53,052
She said she'd sent you tons of messages.
What else could she have done?

830
01:07:55,085 --> 01:07:58,653
I'm dealing with everything just fine.
It's just everyone else that...

831
01:07:58,655 --> 01:08:01,393
Listen to yourself.
Everyone else?

832
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:04,329
You're just not there for him.

833
01:08:14,472 --> 01:08:16,075
- I wanna talk to him.
- Wait.

834
01:08:21,645 --> 01:08:24,946
When you came back...
from that hospital,

835
01:08:24,948 --> 01:08:27,353
I don't think
you ever really came back.

836
01:08:29,587 --> 01:08:30,823
That's not fair.

837
01:08:36,895 --> 01:08:42,968
[exhales sharply] Okay.
Uh, look, I appreciate everyone's concern.

838
01:08:47,572 --> 01:08:49,875
The truth is that I, um...

839
01:08:52,109 --> 01:08:58,384
I've been focused on a...
situation that's come up.

840
01:09:01,853 --> 01:09:06,391
It's actually kind of...
incredible.

841
01:09:08,592 --> 01:09:11,697
I know this might sound crazy.
I know.

842
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:19,605
But I happened to meet
this little girl.

843
01:09:22,006 --> 01:09:25,010
And I... I don't know
for sure yet.

844
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:33,518
There's a very strong
likelihood...

845
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:37,021
that it's Rosie.

846
01:09:43,161 --> 01:09:45,063
- Sweet love.
- Yeah.

847
01:09:46,997 --> 01:09:48,065
Yeah?

848
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:50,067
She's dead.

849
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:53,268
Our Rosie is dead.

850
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:55,103
No, you don't know that.

851
01:09:55,105 --> 01:09:56,175
Please don't say that.

852
01:09:56,908 --> 01:09:59,107
I'm trying to move on.

853
01:09:59,109 --> 01:10:04,213
I've been trying,
but maybe there's a reason why I can't.

854
01:10:04,215 --> 01:10:07,886
I can't explain it,
but I can feel it.

855
01:10:10,054 --> 01:10:12,858
Mike, it could be her.

856
01:10:14,192 --> 01:10:16,060
It could be our daughter.

857
01:10:17,595 --> 01:10:21,766
Lizzie,
when will this end?

858
01:10:23,635 --> 01:10:26,168
Well, if you hadn't
had her cremated back then,

859
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:28,704
it could have ended with an
autopsy, and we would have realized

860
01:10:28,706 --> 01:10:31,107
that it wasn't our
daughter who was dead!

861
01:10:31,109 --> 01:10:33,142
You think I had a choice?

862
01:10:33,144 --> 01:10:34,744
You should have been there!

863
01:10:34,746 --> 01:10:36,211
You should have been
with me that night!

864
01:10:36,213 --> 01:10:37,983
You told me to go home
with Thomas!

865
01:10:41,252 --> 01:10:44,623
Lizzie, just stop! Please.

866
01:10:45,122 --> 01:10:46,157
Stop.

867
01:10:50,328 --> 01:10:52,631
We have been over this
a thousand times.

868
01:10:53,297 --> 01:10:55,634
Whatever it is
you're feeling...

869
01:10:56,935 --> 01:10:58,103
I feel for you.

870
01:10:59,737 --> 01:11:01,573
But you're not the only one
that went through this.

871
01:11:03,608 --> 01:11:04,743
I did too.

872
01:11:08,011 --> 01:11:09,847
But you're still stuck
back there.

873
01:11:12,082 --> 01:11:13,652
Why do you think
I had to leave?

874
01:11:19,791 --> 01:11:21,994
And now
Thomas is being affected.

875
01:11:23,328 --> 01:11:24,563
How?

876
01:11:26,331 --> 01:11:28,731
You make him
celebrate her birthday.

877
01:11:28,733 --> 01:11:30,633
I'm not making him!

878
01:11:30,635 --> 01:11:32,704
Please don't make me take
him away from you for good.

879
01:11:35,806 --> 01:11:37,074
It's not what I want.

880
01:11:38,976 --> 01:11:40,679
But I'm taking him
this week.

881
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:43,916
For now.

882
01:11:49,252 --> 01:11:51,687
- Are you two happy now?
- Damn it, Lizzie.

883
01:11:51,689 --> 01:11:54,690
You've gotta stop living with a ghost.
She's not coming back. Accept it!

884
01:11:54,692 --> 01:11:59,027
She is still alive!
I can feel it! I'm her mother!

885
01:11:59,029 --> 01:12:01,964
- I'm her fucking mother! I would know!
- Elisabet.

886
01:12:01,966 --> 01:12:03,635
[speaking Swedish]

887
01:12:06,304 --> 01:12:07,937
Elisabet.

888
01:12:07,939 --> 01:12:09,274
You don't believe me.

889
01:12:16,046 --> 01:12:17,148
[sighs]

890
01:12:18,082 --> 01:12:19,685
Oh, Lizzie!

891
01:12:24,689 --> 01:12:25,824

- Lena!

You looking for
the bathroom?

Uh, yeah. Yeah.

914
01:15:21,231 --> 01:15:22,367
It's just through there.

What are you doing here?

918
01:16:03,474 --> 01:16:05,342
Your husband invited me.

919
01:16:06,109 --> 01:16:08,576
You need to leave my house.

920
01:16:08,578 --> 01:16:11,882
I'll pay for a DNA test.
It's the only way.

921
01:16:13,216 --> 01:16:14,549
Excuse me?

922
01:16:14,551 --> 01:16:16,320
I know what I know.

923
01:16:17,255 --> 01:16:18,390
God!

924
01:16:20,658 --> 01:16:23,592
- I want my daughter back.
- Get out!

925
01:16:23,594 --> 01:16:26,160
You're sick.
Do you understand that?

926
01:16:26,162 --> 01:16:29,164
You need to leave my family
alone once and for all, okay?

927
01:16:29,166 --> 01:16:32,567
We are now officially
in restraining order territory.

928
01:16:32,569 --> 01:16:35,539
You need to get the fuck off my
property before I call the police.

929
01:16:49,287 --> 01:16:52,257
[panting] Fuck.

930
01:16:54,692 --> 01:16:58,294
- You okay? Was that her?
- Yeah, it was.

931
01:16:58,296 --> 01:17:00,262
[Bernard] I thought you called
her and told her not to come.

932
01:17:00,264 --> 01:17:02,033

01:17:24,354 --> 01:17:26,321

- [man] Great party.

937
01:17:26,323 --> 01:17:28,057
- [Bernard] Thanks for coming.
- [Claire] See ya.

938
01:17:28,059 --> 01:17:29,625
Come visit us in Perth.

939
01:17:29,627 --> 01:17:31,360
- [man] Yeah, we will.
- [woman] Safe travels.

940
01:17:31,362 --> 01:17:33,128

01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,722
- [Claire] Pass the platters?
- [Bernard] Sure. Just leave them. I'll get them.

945
01:17:59,724 --> 01:18:01,656
[Claire] No,
I'm just gonna rinse them off.

946
01:18:01,658 --> 01:18:04,058
[Bernard] Okay. Come on.
Let's do the rest in the morning.

947
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:06,530
[Claire] Okay.
Can you lock the back?

948
01:18:48,538 --> 01:18:49,974
[Bernard]
Come to bed, my love!

949
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:52,978

[Bernard] Can I just say,

954
01:20:22,699 --> 01:20:27,468
I am so, so sorry

955
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:31,874
that I didn't take you more seriously
about how crazy she is, okay?

956
01:20:31,876 --> 01:20:35,177
And look, you were right.

957
01:20:35,179 --> 01:20:38,649
I should have done something when
she took her out on the boat.

958
01:20:39,682 --> 01:20:41,782
Tomorrow morning,
after I pick up the kids,

959
01:20:41,784 --> 01:20:43,585
we're going to go to
the police station

960
01:20:43,587 --> 01:20:46,524
and we will get
a restraining order, okay?

961
01:20:47,490 --> 01:20:48,525
[Claire] Thanks.

[Bernard] I'm going to
get the kids, sweetheart.

967
01:21:25,662 --> 01:21:26,697
Okay.

968
01:21:27,765 --> 01:21:28,833
[Bernard]
Anything you need?

969
01:21:30,234 --> 01:21:31,402
No, just them.

[screams]

975
01:24:19,703 --> 01:24:23,641
You broke into my home,
and you attacked me.

976
01:24:24,774 --> 01:24:27,511
- I could fucking end this right now.
- Stab me.

977
01:24:28,078 --> 01:24:30,478
- Stab me!
- Listen to me!

978
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:33,048
You are going to walk
out of my life right now.

979
01:24:33,050 --> 01:24:38,018
No, I'm not. You have to kill
me 'cause I'm never gonna stop.

980
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:39,056
God!

981
01:24:40,823 --> 01:24:42,124
I know what I know.

982
01:24:42,126 --> 01:24:43,594
And what is that?

983
01:24:46,162 --> 01:24:49,800
You have no idea
what it's like to lose a child.

984
01:24:51,467 --> 01:24:55,072
To spend every day
missing a piece of yourself.

985
01:24:56,105 --> 01:24:59,643
To live with a grief
that never goes away.

986
01:25:01,578 --> 01:25:04,682
I... I lost my baby girl.

987
01:25:07,518 --> 01:25:09,918
I lost my husband.

988
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,890
My marriage. My son
is being taken away from me.

989
01:25:14,625 --> 01:25:16,491
I lost my job.

990
01:25:16,493 --> 01:25:18,058
I can't even go on a date.

991
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:22,097
I can't laugh,
I can't sleep, I can't eat.

992
01:25:22,099 --> 01:25:25,369
I used to be funny.
I used to be funny.

993
01:25:25,969 --> 01:25:27,637
You're out of your mind.

994
01:25:31,207 --> 01:25:35,612
That's what everyone's been saying...
for seven years.

995
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,580
But I...

996
01:25:38,582 --> 01:25:41,782
I know what's mine.

997
01:25:41,784 --> 01:25:44,986
No. Nothing is yours.

998
01:25:44,988 --> 01:25:46,620
I'm gonna prove it.

999
01:25:46,622 --> 01:25:48,956
I'm gonna hunt you down
and prove it.

1000
01:25:48,958 --> 01:25:51,492
- You better get the fuck out of my house!
- I'm never gonna stop.

1001
01:25:51,494 --> 01:25:54,795
- Get out!
- I'm gonna get that DNA

1002
01:25:54,797 --> 01:25:58,933
and your disgusting,
ugly secret is gonna come out,

1003
01:25:58,935 --> 01:26:01,001
and everyone is gonna know
what you really are.

1004
01:26:01,003 --> 01:26:04,108
Get out.
[sniffling]

1005
01:26:05,141 --> 01:26:06,810
Get out.

1006
01:26:10,713 --> 01:26:13,917
You were there.
At the hospital.

1007
01:26:18,555 --> 01:26:21,790
Don't you fucking lie to me!
Don't lie to me!

1008
01:26:21,792 --> 01:26:24,726
I want the whole fucking world
to know what you are!

1009
01:26:24,728 --> 01:26:27,128
That you're a thief
and a fucking liar.

1010
01:26:27,130 --> 01:26:28,729
- I'm not!
- You stole my child.

1011
01:26:28,731 --> 01:26:30,531
- You stole my baby.
- [crying] No.

1012
01:26:30,533 --> 01:26:34,971
No, I saved her.
I saved her.

1013
01:26:35,838 --> 01:26:37,108
[gasps]

1014
01:26:38,641 --> 01:26:41,746
I saved her
because I lost my baby.

1015
01:26:43,814 --> 01:26:47,985
I lost my child to the fire.
She choked to death.

1016
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:51,622
Oh, fuck!

1017
01:26:52,055 --> 01:26:53,958
[sobbing]

1018
01:26:57,860 --> 01:27:01,263
I saw a dead woman on the floor.
I didn't see your face.

1019
01:27:01,265 --> 01:27:03,634
There were flames
and smoke everywhere.

1020
01:27:10,841 --> 01:27:13,511
I already had milk
in my breasts.

1021
01:27:19,115 --> 01:27:21,051
I lost my baby...

1022
01:27:22,886 --> 01:27:25,156
and another one
needed me.

1023
01:27:26,088 --> 01:27:28,926
I didn't even see it.
I heard it.

1024
01:27:33,796 --> 01:27:34,831
Her.

1025
01:27:35,998 --> 01:27:40,604
You heard her.

1026
01:27:41,872 --> 01:27:44,839
Her. Lola.

1027
01:27:44,841 --> 01:27:48,012
No. My Rosie.

1028
01:27:53,984 --> 01:27:56,217
I was alone
for the birth.

1029
01:27:56,219 --> 01:27:59,823
Bernie wasn't there.
I didn't have anyone.

1030
01:28:00,923 --> 01:28:05,595
He doesn't know Lola isn't his.
Please.

1031
01:28:06,662 --> 01:28:08,265
Please don't
take her from me.

1032
01:28:13,170 --> 01:28:14,271
Please.

1033
01:28:15,338 --> 01:28:16,707
[Lola] Mummy?

1034
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:18,975
Oh...

1035
01:28:27,884 --> 01:28:31,021
In the car, kids.
Okay. It's all right.

1036
01:28:31,688 --> 01:28:33,557
I'm s-sorry.

1037
01:28:36,359 --> 01:28:38,093
[door closes]

1038
01:28:38,095 --> 01:28:39,564
[Claire] I'm sorry.

1039
01:28:56,279 --> 01:28:57,682
[door closes]

1040
01:28:59,882 --> 01:29:01,918
[inaudible]

1041
01:29:22,038 --> 01:29:23,206
Is it true?

1042
01:29:29,779 --> 01:29:30,947
I'm so sorry.

1043
01:29:34,917 --> 01:29:37,152
It's her.
I found her.

1044
01:29:37,154 --> 01:29:38,189
Rosie.

1045
01:29:43,393 --> 01:29:45,630
[birds chirping]

1046
01:29:52,335 --> 01:29:54,204
- Want some lemonade, Tom?
- Yeah.

1047
01:30:11,454 --> 01:30:15,925
Um, so, how often is she
going to be staying with us?

1048
01:30:18,761 --> 01:30:22,766
Um, we don't know yet, babe.
We're still working it all out.

1049
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,202
Maybe just a little bit
at first.

1050
01:30:26,770 --> 01:30:28,402
[Thomas] Cool.

1051
01:30:28,404 --> 01:30:31,375
At least for now,
until Claire's trial is over.

1052
01:30:32,475 --> 01:30:35,311
But you're her mother.
She should live with you.

1053
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:40,317
- And Mike, too, of course.
- Hmm.

1054
01:30:41,118 --> 01:30:42,153
[man] Hello?

1055
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:45,789
You ready?

1056
01:30:49,292 --> 01:30:50,728
[Lizzie sighs]

1057
01:31:02,338 --> 01:31:03,373
Hi.

1058
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:11,015
Hi.

1059
01:31:13,283 --> 01:31:14,351
Hi.

1060
01:31:16,386 --> 01:31:18,122
I'm so happy you're here.

1061
01:31:28,265 --> 01:31:29,467
Hello, Lola.

1062
01:31:31,368 --> 01:31:33,003
It's very lovely
to meet you.

1063
01:31:35,471 --> 01:31:39,143
I'm... I'm Mike.

1064
01:31:40,877 --> 01:31:41,979
Hi, Mike.

1065
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:45,349
Hi.

1066
01:32:13,210 --> 01:32:16,247
Um... would you
like to come inside?

1067
01:32:21,184 --> 01:32:22,219
Yeah?

1068
01:32:26,523 --> 01:32:29,193
Um, I got an idea.

1069
01:32:30,426 --> 01:32:33,797
Would you like Jeremy to come
with you this first time?

1070
01:32:39,603 --> 01:32:41,505
Hmm?
Thomas is out the back.

1071
01:32:45,108 --> 01:32:47,275
Uh, yeah. That's...
That'd be fine.

1072
01:32:47,277 --> 01:32:50,010
Jez, do you wanna come and hang
with Thomas and Lola for a bit?

1073
01:32:50,012 --> 01:32:52,479
- Yeah.
- Okay, good boy.

1074
01:32:52,481 --> 01:32:53,984
Yeah.

1075
01:33:01,024 --> 01:33:02,257
[Thomas]
This is Grandma.

1076
01:33:02,259 --> 01:33:05,626
Hello.
My name is Lena.

1077
01:33:05,628 --> 01:33:09,300
It's so lovely to meet you.
So lovely.

1078
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:12,599
- Hi, Lola.
- [Lola] Hi.

1079
01:33:12,601 --> 01:33:14,572
I'm Carl,
your grandpa.
