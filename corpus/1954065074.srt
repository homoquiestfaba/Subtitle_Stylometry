1
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,720
I devote myself to Allah
and pray for Him

2
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,560
to grant my habitation among the excellent,
forever in heaven.

3
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,600
My heart, I rinse
in the light of the law and faith.

4
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,280
And my patience guides me right
When I'm lost.

5
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,960
Come on, girls!
Stand on your places.

6
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,240
And again....

7
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,360
Wadjda!

8
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,000
Come closer!

9
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,220
Let's see...
Repeat the first two verses.

10
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,120
Do you not want us to hear
your voice? Go outside. Go outside!

11
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,180
Again.

12
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,760
Don't forget the keys, and don't lock
upstairs. Dad will be late from work.

13
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,480
- Okay?
- God willing.

14
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,840
It's a long way and you're always late.

15
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,080
I have to drive other people too.
If you're late again, I won't wait.

16
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,240
- Mom is not late. You just got here.
- Ignore him.

17
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,760
I'm not talking to you, little girl. I'm
talking to your Mom. I tell her every day.

18
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,440
Watch out!

19
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,980
- Soon you'll be a pro.
- Where have you been all week?

20
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,580
Jar has something for you.

21
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,960
A volcanic rock from the Rub Al-Khali desert.
It's magnetic.

22
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,680
Dad! Mom has been waiting
for you all week.

23
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,320
The door upstairs is unlocked.

24
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,080
What a mustache! It would make great
advertising for shaving cream.

25
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,160
It's good. A real mustache even
a falcon could land on it.

26
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,140
Or maybe an airplane.

27
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,380
Thank you for breakfast.

28
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,840
Finally, I got my sandwich back!

29
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,640
Watch it!

30
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,200
Who said you can catch up with me?
Did you really try to overtake me?

31
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,080
If I had a bike you'd see.

32
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,080
Girls, stop!
Why are you laughing and talking so loud?

33
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,880
You forget that women's voices must
not be heard by the men outside.

34
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,360
How often must I repeat it?
That a woman's voice is taboo.

35
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,360
- Sorry, Miss Hassa.
- We won't do it again.

36
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,360
Wadjda!

37
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,080
Where is your headscarf?

38
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,000
Did you come to school
with the head uncovered?

39
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,640
Stop it, girls, don't laugh!

40
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:10,600
Good girl! Come on up!
Come up and play with us.

41
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,240
Wadjda!

42
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,720
- Don't talk to me.
- Wait a moment, please...

43
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,200
I brought you this.

44
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:52,160
We are not even yet. When I get my
bike and win the race, we're even.

45
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,520
- Do you know that girls don't ride bikes?
- Double loss if it is against the girl.

46
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,120
You! Go play somewhere else.

47
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,120
800 Rials.

48
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,920
Too expensive for you.

49
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,840
- Hello.
- Hello.

50
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,880
I'll make some lunch for you.

51
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,280
Oh, God! A three-hour drive
in a car without air conditioning!

52
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,340
This trip to the world's end
is killing me.

53
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:29,640
- I don't like that face. What's up?
- I want a bicycle to ride with Abdalla.

54
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,200
Have you ever seen a girl on a bike?
I'd rather sell fruit at the hospital
than endure that ride again.

55
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,200
- And when I come back,
I hear "I want a bike."

56
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,440
- Where are the bracelets?
- I only did ten. My back was killing me.

57
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,720
That'll be two Rials each.

58
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,160
I had so much pain in my back,
When I sat down, but I made them.

59
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,040
God save me, for you! Take it.

60
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,040
It's your turn.

61
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,080
Watch out, girls.
There are men watching us.

62
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,800
- What? Maybe they think they're Superman?
- If you can you see them, they can see you.

63
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:15,920
Respectable girls go inside.
The others stay where men can see them.

64
00:15:54,080 --> 00:16:00,760
What are you doing here? Go to your class.
Don't you see there are men up there?

65
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,280
- Did you hear? Thieves broken in at Miss Hussa.
- It was her lover not a thief.

66
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,120
Her father thought
it was a thief and called the police.

67
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:28,240
- If he said it was a thief, then it was a thief.
- I knew you were going to say that, Salma.

68
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,600
The only man that would show
interest in you would be a thief.

69
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,680
Wadjda.

70
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,760
Can you bring this to my brother?

71
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,440
It's my pass.

72
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,480
- I'll give you ten Rials.
- Twenty.

73
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,160
God, you are something...

74
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,640
He's waiting behind the school
and is in a white pickup.

75
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,640
Wadjda.

76
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,520
Tomorrow you are wearing a headscarf
otherwise you'll be sitting in the sun.

77
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,520
I will, God willing.

78
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,800
Cover the face.

79
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,160
- Are you Abir's brother?
- I am.

80
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,040
Do you have the card?

81
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,880
Here, Abir said
you would give me 20 Rials.

82
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,920
- Really?
- Yes, so help me God.

83
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,960
Okay, here you are.

84
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,680
Huh? Even your money stinks of
cologne.

85
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,920
"I long for you, my dear."

86
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,840
Did you know that there's a new invention
called a tape recorder.

87
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,880
- You want to buy something?
- I'm not sure.

88
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,240
First, I need to look around.

89
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,560
- No tapes. Only CD.
- Thank you. See you tomorrow.

90
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,920
Do you believe me or do I need to swear?

91
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,280
I can not find words to describe you.

92
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,800
Do you believe me or do I need to swear?

93
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,280
I can not find words to describe you.

94
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,440
Love's loveliness is within you...

95
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:29,200
- Wouldn't you like to be a singer?
- Me, a singer? God forbid!

96
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,160
I have saved 87 Rials so far and
only need another 713.

97
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,040
Could you lend it to me?

98
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,640
Oh, no! Not the bike again!
Stop nagging me, please!

99
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,880
Ms. Hussa said I must have
a headscarf, and cover the face.

100
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,560
That was neat! A veil!
Maybe we can marry you after all?

101
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,440
Very funny!

102
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,600
Come...

103
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,000
Try this.

104
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,920
Mom, it's too long.

105
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,440
Hold it like so, from the bottom.

106
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,800
Oh, no! A thief, a thief!

107
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,880
A thief jumped Miss Hussa's fence
to see her.

108
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:51,000
We don't know, it may have been a thief.
You should be ashamed to say that.

109
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,400
A thief.

110
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,400
A thief! a thief!

111
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,760
I need to buy a nice dress
for your cousin's wedding

112
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:07,880
so that women will think twice before
they start fantasizing about your dad.

113
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:20,320
Forgive me, my dear Leila.
I'm truly sorry.

114
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:27,320
Iqbal, our driver, is so rude.
Today, he screamed at poor Aisha.

115
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,120
She cried throughout the journey.

116
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,840
Abir. Mariam's daughter?

117
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,400
They caught her with a man?
Do you know who he is?

118
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:52,360
Ah, I know who he is.
A womanizer like his dad.

119
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,800
Is he as good-looking as his dad?

120
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,520
You have to admit he is good-looking.

121
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,080
The religious police?

122
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,520
Mariam must be totally destroyed. They
should have married her off long ago.

123
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,520
That kind of girl is always
a nuisance.

124
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,240
Leila, I have to go now.
My husband has just arrived.

125
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,760
But I want a minute by minute
account of Abir's shenanigans.

126
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,040
Take care. Goodbye.

127
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,680
What is it?

128
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:43,080
Don't worry. We'll marry
you away someday. Go and say hi to Daddy.

129
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,960
Oh, God, why did I change my game?
I lost.

130
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:21,480
- Are those your marks or did you fake them?
- Really. I'm good with math.

131
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,840
The proof? Pythagoras theorem is God's
miracle. The triangle never changes.

132
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,920
It sounds like you know
what you are talking about.

133
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,560
Now, I'm saving for a bike.

134
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,640
I lost.

135
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,240
Where is dinner?

136
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,200
What a beauty!

137
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,840
- A superstar is here.
- Get out! What do you mean "superstar"?

138
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,920
Your mom spends her days
looking for a bride for you?

139
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,880
I doubt that she tries so hard.

140
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,520
- Come play with me.
- I don't know how.

141
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,040
Let me play.

142
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,800
Tapes with love songs.

143
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,680
Bracelets for football clubs.

144
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,640
Are you organizing a fan club or what?

145
00:25:53,800 --> 00:26:00,200
Don't you know these things
are banned in school?

146
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:08,800
Abir always behaved so well.
She never caused any problems.

147
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:16,320
Did you know that yesterday the religious
police came and found her with a stranger?

148
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,760
Did you arrange the meeting
between Abir and this man yesterday?

149
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,920
- No, ma'am, I didn't.
- Don't lie.

150
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:33,360
I'm sure you were involved.
I just don't know how.

151
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
What shall we do with you now?
Expel you?

152
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,840
One moment, Miss Jamila.
I'm not finished with this girl.

153
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:59,640
You can go back to your class now.
We'll see what we'll do with you later.

154
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:17,600
Madjda, replace those worn shoes, have
regular black shoes like the other girls.

155
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,400
What's this?

156
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:28,120
The religious club's Qur'an competition.

157
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:44,640
I really don't know
what to say, Principal.

158
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,680
All of this for the sake of a bicycle?
As long as I live, you won't have one.

159
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,200
Should I wait until you get kicked out?

160
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,040
Turn off the damn radio
and those infernal songs.

161
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,800
Those songs only mean trouble.

162
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:16,600
You are not better than Abir.
Soon, her parents will marry her off.

163
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,640
Do I have to pay? Can't you pay
yourself for once?

164
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,080
I already paid for your driver. Your money
is into savings.

165
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,440
How are you going to pay for your new
bride's dowry? Some kind of groom you are.

166
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,840
Do you think I yearn to
support two families?

167
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,720
Give me a son and everything will be
well again.

168
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,880
But we both know that won't happen.

169
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:11,880
Forget it, but don't count
on me next week.

170
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:19,320
Don't come back! Go home to your mother
and keep looking for a bride.

171
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:54,400
Lady, I'll wait for you for an hour. If
you're late, you'll have to get a taxi.

172
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,200
That's enough, Iqbal. We get it.

173
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,920
Who is that little girl, Iqbal?

174
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,560
That little girl is my daughter.
I haven't seen her in the last three years.

175
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:13,040
She is going to school now.
I never went.

176
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:18,760
- It shows. You can't behave yourself.
- Shut up.

177
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,920
It's you who doesn't know how to behave.

178
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,240
I make better bracelets than these.
Can I get ten Rials per piece?

179
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,720
No. I get them from China.
100 for 10 Rials.

180
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:04,960
- But not with our country's colors?
- You mean like these?

181
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,240
- Can I try it?
- Sure.

182
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,360
There's a women's fitting room
at the far end of the corridor.

183
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,000
If it's too large, we can fix it.

184
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,200
Thank you.

185
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:30,280
What do you think?
Would your father like it?

186
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:43,400
Let's go back to the clerk,
so that they can fit it up a bit.

187
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,960
Let's go before Iqbal gets angry
and leave us behind.

188
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:52,240
Don't worry, he won't leave.

189
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,040
Pass me the dress.

190
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,760
- Who was the boy you spoke with about the bike yesterday?
- What boy? What are you talking about?

191
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:23,520
You know very well. I don't want you
to sell my bike to someone else.

192
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:30,240
Here. I mixed an audio tape for you,
because we are friends now.

193
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,680
But don't sell my bike to anyone.

194
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,560
God willing.

195
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,400
Ms. Hussa will explain the rules
for the Qur'an competition.

196
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,000
It's in about five weeks.

197
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,560
I'll send around a sign-up sheet.
- Ms. Hussa....

198
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,560
Good news, girls. The prize has been
increased to 1,000 Rials, from 800.

199
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,240
You must memorize the first six sections.

200
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,920
The competition is in two parts.

201
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:17,280
First, the terms and background
to God's revelation in the verses.

202
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,920
Second part is the recitation.

203
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,640
The recitation should be with
the correct pronunciation.

204
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,360
I repeat, correct pronunciation is a must.

205
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,080
Good luck in your endeavors.

206
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,600
What do you want?

207
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:02,680
I've thought a lot about what you said.
I'm willing to change my ways.

208
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:07,160
God be praised! Why all of a sudden?

209
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,920
I want to become a member of the
religious club.

210
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,320
How much?

211
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,800
Only 80 Rials.
Cheaper than a bike, right?

212
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,600
Is 62 okay?

213
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,560
"Choose the right answer.
What are sabianerna?"

214
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,600
"Wrong. Retry.
What are sabianerna?"

215
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,240
Okay, brother!

216
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,560
"Wrong. Retry.
What are sabianerna?"

217
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,360
- How should I know?
- Iqbal!

218
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,680
We pay you every month,
whether you drive me or not.

219
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:19,400
Why do you speak like that to me?
Have you no shame?

220
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:24,160
How so? Do you believe that you are
the only driver around here?

221
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,240
I'll get another driver tomorrow.

222
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:12,960
Guys! I 'll be late
to school. I must go.

223
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,560
Abdalla, how do I get to Derah?

224
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,120
Come on.

225
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,240
Hide your face.
I'll say you are my sister.

226
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:35,120
Your sister? No one will believe you. I am
too cute to be your sister.

227
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:40,080
"I can't arrange transportation today.
Could I take a leave of absence?"

228
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,720
I still have some leave coming to me.

229
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,440
Certainly. Next month
I can sub in for others.

230
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:58,240
That's very kind of you.
See you tomorrow. Take care.

231
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:32,200
- Do you know where the driver Iqbal lives?
- There are many drivers named Iqbal here.

232
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,520
I hope we are going in the right direction.

233
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,720
That could be Iqbal's car.

234
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,240
Yes, it's his.

235
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,760
What do you want?

236
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,440
Iqbal?

237
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,640
This is not my business.
Speak with him yourself.

238
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,880
All right.

239
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,840
- You? What do you want?
- Iqbal, why did you do it?

240
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,280
Go away.

241
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,640
- Where is your permit?
- What? Why do you want it?

242
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,640
It's a good job. Drive Wadjda's mother
again, and everything will be all right.

243
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:30,760
Do you know my uncle, with the mustache, I'll speak with him.
He'd be interested about your permit.

244
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,200
"My uncle, with the mustache..."

245
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:48,560
He knew who I was talking about.
The mustache is like a trademark.

246
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,160
They say the son wrapped explosives
around his waist and bam... He died.

247
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:01,000
- Clueless type! That must have hurt.
- Dying for a man of God is like pinpricks.

248
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,520
And then you ascend to heaven
and get 70 virgins.

249
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,760
Is it true?

250
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,320
Pang! 70 bikes!

251
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,560
You are wrong.
Doesn't work that way.

252
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:34,680
Come on. Did you missed us?
You've been away for two weeks.

253
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,840
Do you think about us or somebody else?

254
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:49,520
If you have the moon,
Why are you looking among the stars?

255
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,240
Okay. Take care of yourself.

256
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,840
Keep studying.

257
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,600
Hello? Hello, Leila.

258
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:15,320
So. will you come?
Can you bring the money you owe me?

259
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:21,160
Is that true? Do you work at the
hospital across the street?

260
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,600
Does your husband let you work
with other male colleagues?

261
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,200
What do you want?

262
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:38,200
My uncle asked me to hang some lights across
the street and attach them on your roof.

263
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,760
Hang them on the neighbor's house's
roof instead. Not on our roof.

264
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:48,200
They do not have a pole to attach them to.
Your roof is the only one that has one.

265
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,880
Wait a minute.

266
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,400
Mom....Mom...

267
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,600
Thank you, sweetie. You can be
a darling sometimes.

268
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:12,080
Abdalla wants to hang some lights
in our roof, for his uncle's election.

269
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,040
Tell him no. He does not represent
our party and we won't vote for him.

270
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,560
Okay, I'll let you do it on condition
that you bring your bike in the morning.

271
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,320
Hello, Wadjda.

272
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,520
You've grown so much and look so beautiful.

273
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,560
- Where's your Mom?
- She's coming.

274
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:48,160
- How's school?
- I don't like it but it's okay.

275
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,440
Traitor! You live next door and
don't tell me?

276
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:05,240
I've had it with Iqbal! Three hours
in his car every day it's too much.

277
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,400
In addition, the hospital has
good hours and good pay.

278
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,040
And the driver waits for me.

279
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,800
When is the party?

280
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,080
Next month. I'm going to buy a dress
for Wadjda uncle's wedding.

281
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,000
The future pretenders will also be there.

282
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:28,360
God help them. You'll break their hearts.

283
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:34,600
By the way, they are hiring at the hospital.
It's next door and we could be together.

284
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,880
My husband is jealous. He wouldn't
let me work with male colleagues.

285
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,400
Stop it. You always blame everything
on your poor husband.

286
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,120
- What's this?
- Training wheels. It'll help you learn to ride a bike.

287
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,880
I have to hang up the lights,
so I can't push you.

288
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,360
You think I'm a too little?

289
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:11,000
I took off the training wheels.

290
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,520
I'll give you five Rials
if you stop crying.

291
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:11,200
OK, girls. Let's start.
You all have your Qur'an?

292
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:17,560
Before we begin, if you have your period
you can't touch the Qur'an without Kleenex.

293
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:22,360
It's no laughing matter.
You are young women now.

294
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,040
I said stop.

295
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:29,920
You take it by the edge with a Kleenex,
not with your fingers.

296
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,520
Page 87.

297
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:38,360
Start with Surat al-Nisa, Ayat 59.

298
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:41,680
Let's start with a new face.
Wadjda.

299
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,800
Wadjda, start reading.

300
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,760
- "O ye who believe!"
- Louder.

301
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,800
"Believe!"

302
00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:01,360
- "Obey God and..."
- "Obey Allah and obey the Messenger..."

303
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:12,960
- "..And those charged..."
- "...with authority among you..."

304
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:19,240
- ".. If ye "branch"..."
- What "branch"? You read it wrong.

305
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,520
- ".. If ye differ in anything..."
- "... among yourselves, refer it to..."

306
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:30,800
- ".. If ye differ in anything,
refer it to Allah and His Messenger."

307
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:41,800
That's enough. - Noura, continue.

308
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:47,040
"O ye who believe! Obey Allah and obey the
Messenger, and those charged with..."

309
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,400
"... authority among you.
If ye differ in anything" -

310
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:56,160
- "among yourselves, refer it to Allah
and His Messenger..."

311
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,680
So much pounding about a bike
and you can't even ride it.

312
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,360
I want to buy one. I have a plan.

313
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,600
- What is it?
- An antenna for all radio stations.

314
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,920
My uncle will speak
with two famous Qur'an readers

315
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,400
who "get one's heart to melt."

316
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,480
You have not heard mother sing.
She should have her own show.

317
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:39,120
We'll talk about this later.

318
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:30,040
- Where's the nail polish?
- I hid it there the other day.

319
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:39,200
What are you doing here?
Why did you have your hand under her skirt?

320
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,720
Go to my office immediately!

321
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:20,560
Wadjda, wake up, sweetheart.
Get up, we'll say the morning prayers.

322
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,280
I saw girls cycling on TV.
Why don't you give me the money for a bike?

323
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,840
I know you have money.
I saw it in the drawer.

324
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,640
Girls don't ride bicycles. You will not
be able to have children if you ride.

325
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:49,320
You don't ride and yet you
can't have sons.

326
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,920
How can you say that?
I almost died when I had you.

327
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,280
Wash before prayers.

328
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:28,240
Girls!
Who knows where the 'Tajwid'? Page 92.

329
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,840
- Which verse is it?
- Verse 88?

330
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,960
"He who..."

331
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:37,000
- What kind of 'Tajwid' is it?
- Idgham?

332
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,160
- Moughanna.
- Excellent!

333
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,000
What are you thinking, Wadjda?

334
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:49,840
This competition is very difficult for me.

335
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,160
I listened to the Qur'an
on the radio yesterday.

336
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:57,480
"If the learning of the Qur'an is difficult
for you, God will reward you twice."

337
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:02,680
Good.
- I want you all to look Wadjda as an example -

338
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:06,920
- Someone who endeavors
and is committed to God and His Prophet.

339
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,840
- You are making progress.
- Thank you, miss.

340
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,200
Sorry.

341
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,840
Wadjda, Miss Hussa wants to talk to you.

342
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,320
Put down the Qur'an.

343
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:48,560
You will be surprised, but you remind me
of myself at your age.

344
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,120
And look at me now.

345
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Close the door.

346
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,240
You still insist that you did not
do anything behind the school?

347
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:18,680
We were reading magazines. Ask her.

348
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:31,040
I'm not sure, miss.
I was far away.

349
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:40,160
Thanks, Wadjda. You can go back now.
Give this folder to Miss Jamila.

350
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,400
Close the door.

351
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:02,240
This is a warning. If you sign it
you get to stay in school.

352
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:23,720
In the name of God, I congratulate you all
for your efforts this semester.

353
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:32,720
I remind you that the school is
a place of learning and morality.

354
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,520
Listen carefully.

355
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:41,520
Two students were found in the backyard
where they committed a sin.

356
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,200
The two are...

357
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:48,520
Faten Khaled and Fatima Abdalla.

358
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:56,040
To avoid similar occurrences -

359
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:01,040
- May you no longer bring flowers
to school -

360
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:07,480
- And you may not give each other
either love letters or fan mail.

361
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:11,480
And you can't hold hands.

362
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,800
Have you understood?

363
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,600
Then you can go back to your classroom.

364
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,720
Your bags are there.

365
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,120
Don't touch me.

366
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:17,720
I'd like to have my hair cut like
Lubna Abdul Aziz.

367
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,720
You should have it cut, then.

368
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,360
Your dad loves my long soft hair.

369
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,880
My Mom saw the lights
but said nothing.

370
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,760
Your Mom?
What about your dad?

371
00:58:55,200 --> 00:59:01,880
I think they like your uncle now that he's
been in Radio Qur'an.

372
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:12,840
- I'm bleeding.
- Whereabouts did you get hurt?

373
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:17,000
I'm bleeding from the knee.

374
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:20,520
How many times do I have to say that bikes
are not for girls.

375
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:26,560
You think you can behave like the boys?
And you? Why did you let her ride?

376
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:31,320
Come back! Take your bike away!

377
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:35,320
I'll tell your uncle about you.

378
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,960
Get up.

379
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:46,320
How do you dare letting a boy come in
the house when no one is home.

380
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,160
If you Dad knew, he'd kill you.

381
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,920
Do you want the men to hear you?
Remove the bread from the oven.

382
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:47,240
Oh, how nice of you! They are impressed.
You always make me so proud.

383
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,680
Hope it's good enough for you.

384
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:20,320
Turki, Saleh Ali Abdurahman.

385
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:25,080
Abulazziz, Rashed, Abdalla.
My Dad....

386
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:37,200
Interested in Dad's amazing family tree?

387
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:42,240
You are not included, only the men.

388
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:02,120
When you're finished
clean up after yourself.

389
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:06,760
I don't want him to be mad at us again.

390
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:37,520
WADJDA

391
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,480
Give me the photos.

392
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:43,000
I said 'give it here."

393
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:46,520
Stop it. What's going on here?

394
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:53,720
- Salma has her wedding photos.
- Congratulations. May I see them?

395
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:58,120
Are these from your wedding?

396
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,440
Is this your husband?

397
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:07,760
- How old is he?
- Twenty.

398
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,160
Quiet, girls. Don't laugh.

399
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:15,720
Photos are not allowed in school.
Let's start.

400
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,280
Sura an-Nisa. Page 97.

401
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:24,840
Wadjda, start reading from verse 115.

402
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:30,680
- I will try to recite.
- Fine! Close the Qur'an and start.

403
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:35,400
"And whoever contradicts
and opposes the Messenger"

404
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,640
"after the right path has been shown clearly to
him, and follows other than the believers' way."

405
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:43,720
"We shall keep him in the
path he has chosen,"

406
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:48,480
"and burn him in Hell."
"what an evil destination."

407
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:52,680
Amazing! But you have to work on
your reading and Tajwid - recitation.

408
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:56,760
If you are aiming to win
you must recite as Salma.

409
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,880
Salma, read verse 115 again.

410
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:04,960
"And whoever contradicts
and opposes the Messenger"

411
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:10,080
"after the right path has been shown
clearly to him, and follows other
than the believers' way."

412
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:14,520
"We shall keep him in the
path he has chosen,"

413
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:19,520
"and burn him in Hell.
What an evil destination."

414
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:24,880
"Verily! Allah forgives not (the sin of)
setting up partners in worship with Him"

415
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:29,960
"but He forgives whom he pleases
sins other than that"

416
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:34,720
"and whoever sets up partners
in worship with Allah,"

417
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:40,040
"has indeed strayed far away."

418
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,240
Excellent.

419
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:57,040
- Are you mad at me now?
- I have homework to do.

420
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:04,920
Wait a minute. I brought you a cask.
Such as like on TV.

421
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:15,400
Want to ride a little? Behind the tent.
We have a while before people come.

422
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:22,040
Abdalla, look!

423
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:40,800
The shopkeeper told Khalid and
his father that the bike is reserved.

424
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:44,560
He keeps it safe for me.

425
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,200
The correct answer.

426
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:52,640
Choose the correct answer.
What are sabianerna?

427
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,240
I know the answer.

428
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,600
The correct answer.

429
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,000
Finally!

430
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:07,160
You've never listened to me.
Why should I listen to you?

431
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,080
Get dressed, we're going out.

432
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:22,120
Don't let the Qur'an be left open.
The devil can spit on it.

433
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:27,520
Will you be Working with Leila? Cool lab
coats, as in "The Matrix," but whites.

434
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:31,400
Quiet, I only want to give her something.

435
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,240
Wadjda!

436
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,280
Hello and welcome.

437
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:46,200
Leila, why do you not hide your face?

438
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:52,600
Never mind!
Let me get an application form for you.

439
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,680
Welcome!

440
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:59,200
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

441
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,480
It's a great job and there are only
a few places left. You should...

442
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:21,040
Leila, stop. I just wanted to say hi.
I'll call you later, you are busy.

443
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,880
- Take care.
- Where are you going?

444
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,640
Take care.

445
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:30,080
- I thought you were going to work with Leila.
- Stop it.

446
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:44,320
"Among His signs is that He created for you
wives of your own kind.."

447
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:51,960
- "..That ye may dwell in tranquility with them."
- No honey, try this. Listen.

448
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:59,840
"... and He has put love
and mercy between you."

449
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:08,000
" In that there are signs
for those who reflect."

450
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:13,800
I'm so shy.
I can not recite for everyone.

451
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:17,200
You, shy? If only it were true.

452
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,680
Look, there's Daddy!

453
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:35,360
- Where?
- There! There!

454
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:05,720
Do you love him?

455
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:11,560
- Who? Your father?
- No, the boy next door.

456
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:15,800
I don't think it's me
who is in love with the boy next door.

457
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:22,440
That's not funny.
You didn't answer. Do you love him?

458
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:28,880
I was in school
when he asked for my hand.

459
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:35,400
All the girls went crazy when they saw
his photograph. They were so jealous.

460
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:40,480
He is the first man in my life.
Hopefully also the last.

461
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:51,280
You are beautiful. He will fall in love with you
all over again when he sees you in that red dress.

462
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:57,160
Don't worry. He will never take
a new wife and break my heart.

463
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:02,000
Let us practice for tomorrow's competition.

464
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:25,520
The words should come from the heart. Ignore
those around you and recite from the heart.

465
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:29,880
I'd like to be there tomorrow
when you win.

466
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:34,800
But I'll have to commute
to the end of the world again.

467
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,720
Generosity?

468
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,360
Wrong answer.

469
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,360
Next.

470
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:36,280
What does "sadakatouhonn"?

471
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:40,080
- Wedding gift?
- Right.

472
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:41,600
Salma.

473
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:50,400
What is "Al-Furkan"?

474
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:55,040
- Qur'an?
- Right.

475
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,520
Wadjda.

476
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,280
What does "da'ab"?

477
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:16,160
Custom.

478
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,280
Right.

479
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,360
Noura.

480
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:30,880
What does "zaygh"?

481
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:35,160
Weakness.

482
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,360
Right.

483
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:41,320
Next.

484
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:49,400
What does "hawban kabiran"?

485
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:00,560
I'm sorry, Yasmin.
Go back to your seat.

486
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:09,160
What does "hawban kabiran"?

487
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:14,120
Something big?

488
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,440
Wrong. Go back to your seat.

489
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:29,480
- What does "hawban kabiran"?
- Great injustice.

490
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,240
Right.

491
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:34,773
"If we had ordered them this:

492
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:37,448
"'Kill yourselves'

493
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:41,090
"or get out of your homes '

494
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:45,612
"They have not done,
except a few of them."

495
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:51,013
"If they had done what
they exhorted..."

496
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:55,048
"This is the Scripture whereof
there is no doubt."

497
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:57,859
"This is a guide for the righteous,"

498
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,494
"who believe in the unseen"

499
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:02,537
"and do prayer"

500
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:06,130
"and spend,
what We have given them."

501
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:08,896
"Those who..."

502
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:14,295
"Those who..."

503
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:16,572
"Those who..."

504
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:25,800
Thank you, Salma. God bless you.

505
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,800
Wadjda.

506
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:45,880
Verse 7, "Sur'at Al-Baqarah" Starting on
"God has sealed their hearts..."

507
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:53,440
"God has sealed their.."

508
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:07,160
"God has sealed their hearts and
their ears and covered over their eyes."

509
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:11,320
" A severe punishment awaits them."

510
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:16,560
'We believe in God ' " -

511
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:22,240
- "And the Last Day
though they do not believe."

512
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:27,640
"They are trying to deceive God
and the believers."

513
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:34,240
" But they deceive none but
themselves and do not realize it."

514
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:40,640
" Their hearts are sick and
God lets their disease getting worse" -

515
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:47,080
" and a painful punishment awaits them
for their constant lies."

516
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:52,800
"When they are urged not to sow discord
on Earth, they answer."

517
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:56,840
"We just want to improve and make amends."

518
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:01,600
"No, it is they who create discord
and spreads depravation."

519
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:05,200
"But they do not realize."

520
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:15,280
It was excellent, Wadjda.
God bless you.

521
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:23,920
Will you say your prayer next to us?

522
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:28,120
- Congratulations.
- The winner is yet to be declared.

523
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:32,280
You won. You're their favorite.
Their votes will be unanimous.

524
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:38,720
Wadjda, come up!
We kept a place for you in the front row.

525
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,400
Coward.

526
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:46,400
Fall in line.

527
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:52,960
Stand closer together.
Leave no room for the devil.

528
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:56,400
God is great.

529
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:19,360
God hears the prayer of thanks.

530
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:37,320
Quiet, girls. Silence!

531
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:44,200
Finalists in the competition.

532
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:49,400
Noura Saleh, Salma Abdul Aziz
and Wadjda Al Saffan.

533
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:54,360
And now... the third prize goes to...

534
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,360
Salma Abdul Aziz.

535
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:00,320
Congratulations.

536
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:04,840
Winner of the second prize is....

537
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:09,960
Noura Saleh.

538
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,480
Congratulations, Noura.

539
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,680
Wadjda, the first prize goes to you.

540
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:23,360
You won thanks to your dedication and the
fact that you have been so diligent.

541
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:27,520
I hope everyone here
today learn from your example.

542
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:30,080
Congratulations.

543
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:38,720
And what do you intend to use
prize money for?

544
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:43,360
I want to buy a bike at the store
down the street.

545
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,480
What did you say?

546
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:52,600
I want to buy a bike, but without training
wheels because I can ride a bike.

547
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:10,000
Wouldn't it be better to donate the money
for our brothers in Palestine?

548
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,720
A bike is not for girls.

549
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:20,920
Especially not for the benefit of girls
who are afraid of their honor.

550
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:26,160
I'm sure your family will not allow it.

551
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:32,280
The money will be donated in your name and
May God reward you for the good work.

552
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:36,240
Now go back to your place.

553
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:44,000
That's all girls. You can go now.

554
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:49,160
So nothing's changed after all.

555
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:52,640
Do you think your behaviour
will go unnoticed?

556
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:58,800
Your silly attitude
will haunt you forever.

557
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:04,960
You mean like your "fancy" thief?

558
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:35,040
Didn't you win? Where is the money?

559
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:38,080
In Palestine.

560
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:03,400
- I'll give you my bike.
- How can race with one bike?

561
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,320
Wadjda....

562
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:15,720
You know I want to marry you
when we grow up, right?

563
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,840
So. You're finally home.

564
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:57,760
- What's with the new haircut?
- Your mother does not answer my calls.

565
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,960
Can I see?

566
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:07,400
You won? I don't think that's true.
You are my little darling.

567
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:12,280
Why are you crying? You won after all.

568
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:16,440
Wait a second.
- Hello?

569
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:20,320
Are you ready?

570
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:33,680
I'm so proud of you,
my little heroine.

571
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:37,240
I have tried to call your mom all day.

572
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:41,120
When she comes home,
tell her I love her.

573
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:01,920
Hello? Hello, Aunt Leila.

574
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:05,040
No, I don't know where she is.

575
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:11,160
Yes, she is usually home by this time.

576
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:14,920
Okay, I'll tell her.

577
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,120
Goodbye.

578
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:31,400
Congratulations, I heard the news.

579
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:36,160
They said you won.
I couldn't believe it.

580
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:41,160
When you go after something,
no one can stop you.

581
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:50,120
- I did not get the money.
- Why did you say you wanted to buy the bike?

582
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:55,200
Anyway, you don't need them or their money.

583
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:07,920
What happened at grandma's? I thought
the marriage was not until next month?

584
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:11,800
It was not your uncle's wedding.

585
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:28,560
It's okay. He has made his decision.
It's just you and me now.

586
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:50,840
Let's buy the red dress
and go fetch Dad.

587
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:57,680
The dress is no longer needed.
Besides, I already spent the money.

588
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:20,920
I hope it is right.

589
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:25,800
The shopkeeper had held it for
a brave little girl.

590
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,960
I want you to be the happiest person.

591
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:32,960
You're all I have left in this world.

592
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:56,400
- Abdalla.
- Goal!

593
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:29,400
Catch me if you can.
