No, no, no. Come on in.

74
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:26,638
I hope your hungry,
because I made reservations
at the club.

75
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,673
Is-- I hope that's okay.

76
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,442
That's fine.

77
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:32,611
Oh, honey. You just--

78
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,182
You look great.
Really?

79
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,551
Thank you.
So do you.

80
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,052
Well, thanks. Um...

81
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:44,122
I lost ten pounds
since I saw you last.

82
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:47,492
Well, a year and a half.
Not exactly a miracle diet.

83
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,561
Um--

84
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:51,296
I'm just--
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

85
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:54,733
If you want to go ahead
and get settled in, um,
your room is all made up.

86
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,960
What happened to that eye?

87
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:56,494
Hmm.

88
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,931
Senior pictures.

89
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,800
Remember those senior
class pictures?

90
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:03,868
Donnie gibbs,
that son of a bitch,

91
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,804
Gives me a cheap elbow.

92
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:09,274
First day of
basketball practice,
big shiner.

93
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,944
My right eye,
all black and blue.

94
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:17,916
And my mother tells me,
"harry pleasant...

95
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:20,585
"take a good look
at this picture.

96
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:24,889
"your whole life,
every time we look at you

97
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,792
"we're going to see
this black eye.

98
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,494
Your whole life."

99
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,229
( chuckles )

100
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,565
Yeah.

101
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,767
You remember him?

102
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,503
Donnie?
Donnie gibbs.

103
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,075
No.

104
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,649
No, I don't, harry.

105
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,986
To having you home.

106
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,959
To...

107
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:03,528
Honor.
All right.

108
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,197
May you get on 'er
and stay on 'er.

109
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:09,034
If you can't come in 'er,
come on 'er.

110
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,370
That's a new one.

111
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,806
( awkward chuckle )

112
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,941
Hmm.

113
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,511
So, how's jason?

114
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,713
Jay.
Jay. Jay.

115
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:24,115
Administrative assistant.
Musician.

116
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,951
Musician. I knew that,
and, um, that--

117
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,319
Musician.
Musician.

118
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,955
That sounds so fun.
What--what does he play?

119
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:33,124
We broke up, actually.

120
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,794
When did this happen?

121
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:37,529
Man, this is cold.

122
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,998
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait. Wait.

123
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,501
Sweetie...Where
are you living, then?

124
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:47,005
Um, I'm--I'm looking
at a couple of places.

125
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:49,140
Well, that's great. Yeah.
Yeah.

126
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,976
Are you working, or...

127
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:54,813
You know what?
Can we just...Skip this part?

128
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,347
You know what,
I'm your mother.

129
00:11:56,349 --> 00:12:00,085
These are the questions
I'm supposed to ask you,
so...

130
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:02,120
Mother away.

131
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:12,097
You need money,
don't you?

132
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,065
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

133
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,935
How much--how much
do you need this time?

134
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:22,040
I guess, like,
I need, like, $5,000,

135
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:24,109
That would be, like,
first month, last month,

136
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:26,778
Security deposit
kind of thing.

137
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,114
What?

138
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:33,284
Nothing. I just--

139
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:36,154
I'm sorry, I just...
Thought maybe you
came home to see me.

140
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,361
Listen...Honey.

141
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,666
Have you thought about
maybe just..

142
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,272
Moving home for a while?

143
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,975
Um, I'm not moving home.

144
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,210
Why? Why not? Why not?
I'm not moving home.

145
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:02,914
Because I'm in the middle
of things right now.
What things?

146
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,383
Things. My life, mom.
I'm in the middle of my life.

Hard as it is
for you to imagine,

150
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,162
There are bigger problems
to solve right now...

151
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:18,296
Than your life.

152
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,001
Yep.

153
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,239
Well, I'm, um, not hungry.

154
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,575

00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,515
( mouthing words )

183
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,883
Oh!

184
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,821
( laughs, groans )

185
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,828
( shouts )

186
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,230
( fence clanking )

187
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,334
( breathing heavily )

188
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,273
( grunting )

189
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,711
( shouts, groans )

190
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,713
( knocks on door )

191
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,628
( pats hood,
laughs )

192
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,031
This thing
still doesn't run?

193
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,533
No.

194
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,935
You should just
get rid of it.

195
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,838
I don't know.

196
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,474
Probably gonna
fix it up first.

197
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,977
You've been saying that
since high school.

198
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,281
You look different.

199
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,619
Skinny.

200
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,790
( chuckles )

201
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,396
I heard, you know.

202
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,166
About you and milla.

203
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,004
Think I wouldn't find out?

204
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:04,182
You can deny it.
I'll believe you.

205
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,293
( clears throat )

206
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,628
How's your mom?

207
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:21,432
She, uh...

208
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,335
Said she wanted me
to move home.

209
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,705
But...

210
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,807
I told her I couldn't.

211
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:33,711
And I'm....Taking off tomorrow.

212
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:36,047
Things to do.

213
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:39,117
Mom writes you a check,
and...

214
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,719
She's off.
Things to do.

215
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:45,456
Yeah, well,
she cut me off,
actually. So...

216
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,258
Well, uh...

217
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,295
How's, uh...
( counting bills )...

218
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,397
How's three dollars?

219
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,566
Three dollars. Well...

220
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,839
Billy, I don't--

221
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:04,575
I can't take
your lunch money, billy.

222
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,485
Are you happy here?

223
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:22,393
Kissing you
used to make me happy.

224
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,468
Soph. Stop.

225
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,637
Hmm. Stop. Stop.

226
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:35,006
Stop. <i>Stop.</i>

227
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,775
( laughs )

228
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:48,286
Soph...It's okay.

229
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,521
( sniffling ) no.

230
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,590
Nothing's okay.

231
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,842
( mother groaning )

232
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,010
Mom?!

233
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:15,546
I'm in here, sophie.

234
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,248
Mom!

235
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,556
Mom!
I'm okay.

236
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,426
I'm all right,
honey.

237
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,595
Oh...

238
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,565
God, honey.

239
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:52,416
You don't remember me.

240
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,185
No, I do.

241
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,891
Everything okay?

242
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,893
My mom fell.

243
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:04,829
How bad?

244
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:09,200
She'll heal.

245
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:12,937
Friend of mine's getting
a little cut stitched up
over his eye.

246
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:21,612
Took quite a bit of convincing
to get him here.

247
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:25,583
Normally that ain't nothing
except for the fact that he--

248
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,585
He's...

249
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:29,887
Except for what?

250
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:33,658
Except for the fact
that he doesn't remember
how it happened.

251
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,563
He gets confused.

252
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,301
He wanders off.

253
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:46,337
I been staying
with him nights,

254
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:50,574
But it's gotten to a point
where if I don't find somebody
to look after him during the day

255
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:54,078
I might have to
put him in a home.

256
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,550
( sighs )
how much does it pay?

257
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,753
Nurse: Mrs. Conway.

258
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:15,266
Mother: <i>God....</i>
<i>Where's that cream?</i>

259
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:16,934
<i>Where's the cream?</i>

260
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:18,536
<i>Ahh!</i>

261
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,439
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

262
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,607
<i>It's nothing.</i>

263
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,610
I'm fine. I'm not--
I'm not asking you to stay.

264
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:28,012
No-- thank you, honey.

265
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,547
I'll get used to
those crutches,

266
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:31,515
So if you want to go, just--
just go.

267
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,819
It's only two months.
Thank you, honey.

268
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:38,322
Ohh. And I know what I said
in the car, but listen,

269
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:41,459
Listen, I'm not asking you
to stay, okay?

270
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:43,728
You got your whole life
back in los angeles.

271
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:47,298
I'm not about to ask you to
put everything on hold for me.
I mean, that's ridiculous.

272
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,735
I mean, I wouldn't do that,
because I'm not that kind
of person. I'm just--

273
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:53,003
Mom.
What?

274
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:57,241
I was thinking
I would stay...
And get a job.

275
00:22:57,243 --> 00:23:00,177
Honey. Sweetie,
you could--

276
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,680
I told you I'm not
going back to dartmouth,

277
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:05,750
So can you please
just drop it?

278
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:08,085
I know. Shh. I won't. Sorry.

279
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:10,154
If I stay...

280
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:14,625
Just promise me we don't
have to talk about it.

281
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,663
I promise.

282
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:52,763
( knocks )

283
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,205
Sophie?
Hey.

284
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:03,307
Why don't you
come inside?

285
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,116

287
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:17,087

Hi. What a nice surprise.

300
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:52,857
Well, actually, I was just
kind of hoping you could
stop by the house.

301
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:54,758
What, today?

302
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,595
I was thinking like around,
uh, around two o'clock.

303
00:24:57,597 --> 00:25:00,498
Uh, two, two...

304
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,867
Um...

305
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:04,835
Yeah. That--
that should work out fine.

<i>Oh, great.</i>

307
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:07,838
I'll see you then.

308
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,940
All right, bye-bye.

You're alive.

00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:46,510
These people, I don't
know who they are. Those...

319
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:49,847
They say he'll get worse.
What's wrong with him?

321
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:55,819
According to harry?
Nothing.

322
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:59,423
According to the doctors
he has alzheimer's disease.

323
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,930
I make his breakfast,
so it'd be lunch,

324
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:09,934
Maybe dinner, depending on
what time I get back.
Mm-hmm.

325
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:13,904
Don't worry about his bath.
I'll take care of that,
unless you--

Oh. (laughs)

No, that's...
That's cool.

Okay. I guess I'll let you two
get to know each other.

00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:55,766
Mm-hmm.
And I couldn't help but notice

362
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:57,334
My name was still on the sign.

363
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:59,536
I was promised
a monthly payment,

364
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:01,071
By you, by the bank,

365
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,674
There was a whole schedule
worked out. Remember?

366
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:06,176
We're just way past time,
okay?

367
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:09,346
Andy's interest in the firm
falls to me, right?

368
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:13,751
I'd like to help you,
really I would, but...

369
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,953
So...

370
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:17,221
What are you saying?

371
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:20,958
You just have to be patient.

372
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,261
( humorless laughter )
just a little while longer.

373
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:25,596
Sure.

374
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,365
Another year?

375
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,037
What is it?

376
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,373
Huh?

377
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:42,045
Um, I'm in a little bit
of trouble here, steven.

378
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:43,814
What kind of trouble?

379
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:47,551
Uh, just, um, behind on
the mortgage a little bit,

380
00:29:47,553 --> 00:29:50,821
And the creditors are--
are circling.

381
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:54,091
I mean, I guess I could, uh...

382
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:58,695
Could sell the house, uh,
or, I don't know...What, um--

383
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,267
Fucking foreclosure.

384
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:06,170
How far behind are you?

385
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:08,338
Three months.

386
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,009
Let me talk to
some people, and, uh..
Who? Who?

387
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:14,611
Who can you talk to?

388
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:17,181
I know some people
down at the bank.

389
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:22,019
I'll go chat with them
and we'll see if we can
figure this out, okay?

390
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:23,887
Don't worry.

391
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,890
All right?

392
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:31,028
What are you doing?

393
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,497
I've missed you.

394
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:37,167
Oh, god, you're
a terrible liar.

395
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,103
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm serious.

396
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:44,975
I've tried...
I've tried...

397
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:47,010
But it's true.

398
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,244
( crickets chirping )

399
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,718
Hey.

400
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,119
Hey.

401
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:35,125
So...I'm staying.

402
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,729
Okay.

403
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:41,231
I just wanted
to tell you that.

404
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,167
Okay.

405
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,808
Harry: They're gone!

406
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:25,976
Whoa! Harry...

407
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:28,378
You're not wearing
any pants, okay?

408
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,382
They're gone!
The box of pictures
are    <i>gone!</i>

409
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:35,218
Okay. How about
you put on some clothes?

410
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,219
All--all right?

411
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:53,971
Harry, are you
decent yet?

412
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:56,740
( cabinet doors closing )

413
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:58,575
Harry?

414
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:05,182
Hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing?
Hey, harry. Harry.

415
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:07,417
Are these it?

416
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:09,286
I had 'em!
You mean the pictures?

417
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:12,055
Are these--
are these it?
I had a-- what?

418
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,194
Where did you--

419
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,531
Where did you--
where'd you find this?

420
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:25,168
It was in the oven.

421
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,437
The oven!

422
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,206
The oven?!

423
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,174
Yeah.
Oh!

424
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,345
Friends for
fifty-plus--

425
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:39,316
For--for thirty-plus years
with that old man.

426
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:43,153
I never would have
guessed the oven.

427
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:44,454
I--

428
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:48,392
Who would have thought
the oven?

429
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,295
Ahh.

430
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:55,866
My, uh...

431
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:59,302
My, uh...Records

432
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:03,206
And my mail...

433
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:08,412
Sometimes
even my socks,
in the freezer.

434
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:12,749
( chuckles )
and he says <i>I'm</i> the one
who needs help.

435
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:18,388
It's all these...

436
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:23,360
All the letters,
they said, uh...

437
00:34:23,362 --> 00:34:26,530
All these things...

438
00:34:26,532 --> 00:34:28,432
All these things.

439
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:34,071
They said, uh...

440
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:36,740
Ma-make a scrapbook,

441
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:38,608
Uh...

442
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,445
Ohh.

443
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,448
Huh.

444
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,018
This is lucy.

445
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:01,631
She's my daughter.

446
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:09,706
How could you
forget your daughter?

447
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:24,387
Hey.

448
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:26,223
Thank you.

449
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:29,793
Cheers.
Cheers.

450
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:35,465
Harry,
you want some help?

451
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,601
You want to help?

452
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:39,669
Hand me that, uh...

453
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:43,607
Uh...The sticky thing, uh...

454
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:46,076
Uh...

455
00:35:46,078 --> 00:35:47,544
The--

456
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:01,691
Ahh.

457
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,429
That's bernice.

458
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:10,500
She died last year
at mission villa.

459
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:11,835
I'm sorry.

460
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:16,473
She wanted me
to go there too.

461
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,642
It's all she ever
talked about,

462
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:21,511
So we pretty much
stopped talkin'.

463
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,322
Well, I've had
all the crime fighting
I could handle for one day.

464
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:35,559
So   <i>yo</i>get out of here.
It's a beautiful day out there.

465
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:37,561
( chuckles )
oh, wait.

466
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,631
Oh. Thanks.

467
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,535
Bye, harry!

468
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:48,805
See ya.

469
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:54,744
I don't know about
selling this place.

470
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:56,546
Really?

471
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,315
Yeah. I mean...

472
00:36:58,317 --> 00:37:01,251
Sure, it's an option,
but, uh...

473
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:03,320
The more I think
about it,

474
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:06,089
Selling's not a good idea,
not in this market.

475
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:07,524
Yeah?

476
00:37:07,526 --> 00:37:10,327
Yeah,
you're probably right.

477
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:12,596
( sighs ) anyway,
who's gonna buy it?

478
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:15,265
I mean, who--
who are we kidding?

479
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:16,900
Right? This house?

480
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:19,502
It's a beautiful home.

481
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:22,372
Do you remember
when you were a kid

482
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:25,442
There was always
this <i>one</i> house, right?

483
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:30,547
I mean, it was haunted
or there was a witch
living inside of it

484
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:33,750
Or it was where a man...

485
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:37,787
( sighs )
where a man killed himself.

486
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:40,624
Remember?
Yeah.

487
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:45,028
I've been living in that house
for eighteen months.

488
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:48,698
I mean--

489
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,867
You have no idea.
Sometimes I have to

490
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:53,103
Actually hide
behind the curtains

491
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:56,206
Because there's
this whole stream of
little kids and their bicycles

492
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:59,442
Lining up on my driveway,
and they're pointing
and trying to get a look

493
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:03,747
And they're saying,
"ooh! That's where
the man killed himself, mommy,

494
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:06,082
That's where the man
killed himself."

495
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:09,719
Tell you what.
Hmm?

496
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:12,188
Let me pay your mortgage.

497
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:15,759
What?!

498
00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:18,428
( laughs ) no.
I'm serious.

499
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,430
No, no, no, no.
Steven--
really. Look--

500
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:24,401
I'll just bring you
up to date just until
we can figure this out, okay?

501
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:27,103
You asked me for my help;
let me <i>help.</i>

502
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:28,772
Hmm.

503
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:29,839
Sophie, hi!

504
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:31,574
Steven:
Hello, sophie.
You're home early.

505
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,681
"oh, thanks, mom,
I'm--I'm good."

506
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,417
Bye, sweetie!

507
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,683
Bye-bye!

508
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,656
Girls, you did a good job--

509
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:21,524
Oh! You okay?

510
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:24,761
Oh, my goodness.
Okay, bye.

511
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:29,432
Hey.
Hey.

512
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,536
Come here. Oh.

513
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,710
God, your mom told me
you were teaching.

514
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,880
Yeah.
First year point.

515
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,350
Wow.

516
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:48,818
God!

517
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,256
So, how are you?
How's--how's l.A.?

518
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:56,025
It's good.
L.A.'s...Good.

519
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,694
It's amazing, actually.

520
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,696
Are you dancing?

521
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:02,832
Yeah. Yeah. Well,
I mean, auditioning.

522
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:04,768
How long are you home?

523
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:08,538
Um...I don't even know.

524
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,374
My mom just fell
and broke her leg.

525
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:13,576
I'm sorry.

526
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:16,079
About what?

527
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,119
It just happened.

528
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:26,289
Listen...

529
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:28,858
I'm not mad. I'm...

530
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,796
I'm not anything.

531
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:34,798
Yes, you are.

532
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:45,341
Oh, my god.

533
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:54,250
Look, I was--
I was gonna call you back.

534
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:57,921
It's just with teaching
and...Annie...

535
00:40:57,923 --> 00:41:00,423
How is annie?

536
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:02,892
She's almost four.

537
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,096
You want to go
do something?

538
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:09,566
I can't.

539
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:12,735
I have to pick annie up
from the sitter.

540
00:41:12,737 --> 00:41:14,504
Sure.

541
00:41:14,506 --> 00:41:17,173
But we should.

542
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:19,843
Yeah. Yeah.

543
00:41:19,845 --> 00:41:21,878
We should.

544
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:31,521
It's good to see you.

545
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:33,189
You too.

546
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:46,636
This town still dead?

547
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:49,639
I like it here.

548
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:52,876
You've never left.

549
00:41:52,878 --> 00:41:55,545
I've left.

550
00:41:55,547 --> 00:42:00,617
We were gonna
gonna graduate high school
and move to new york.

551
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:03,486
Me, you and milla.

552
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:06,890
It was gonna be beautiful.
We were convinced.

553
00:42:06,892 --> 00:42:09,792
Well, you were convinced.

554
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,796
I wanted to sing,

555
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:16,032
Dance, you know...

556
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:19,702
( laughs )
anything except dartmouth.

557
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:22,071
Well, new york
was your dream.

558
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:24,240
And your dream was what?

559
00:42:24,242 --> 00:42:27,210
Maybe my dream was you.

560
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,154
Thanks.

561
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:49,332
So...

562
00:42:49,334 --> 00:42:51,000
I got a job.

563
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,838
Fuck you. Don't <i>laugh.</i>

564
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,173
( laughing )

565
00:42:57,175 --> 00:43:01,044
You're not supposed to laugh.
I'm serious. I--I got a job.

566
00:43:01,046 --> 00:43:04,847
I'm working for this old guy
named harry pleasant.

567
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:06,916
Which I think is
a very cool name.

568
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,454
What?

569
00:43:11,456 --> 00:43:12,855
Nothin'.

570
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,528
Have you talked
to your dad?

571
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:22,065
No. Got out
and he didn't come home.

572
00:43:22,067 --> 00:43:23,900
Sorry.

573
00:43:23,902 --> 00:43:27,270
I'm not. Yeah,
he's a fuckin' loser.

574
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:31,341
( exhales )

575
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:36,779
Well, how's your mama?

576
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:40,183
My mom's got me.

577
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:48,091
Do you remember
that time we got busted?

578
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:50,093
In the pool?
Mm-hmm.

579
00:43:50,095 --> 00:43:55,465
You asked me if it was true
what people said about my dad.

580
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:57,900
And I remember...

581
00:43:57,902 --> 00:44:00,470
I remember I wanted to say no.

582
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:04,440
I mean, I remember
I wanted to say something,

583
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:07,010
And before I could,
you said, "fine,

584
00:44:07,012 --> 00:44:10,913
As long as we don't have to
talk about my parents either."

585
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:13,716
I really liked that
about you, sophie.

586
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:40,376
Uh, sophie?

587
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:42,278
What?

588
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,280
That was really rude
of you today.

589
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:46,315
I don't like him.
What do you want me to say?

590
00:44:46,317 --> 00:44:48,951
(slurring) yeah, sophie,
that much is clear.

591
00:44:48,953 --> 00:44:51,721
That "mush" is clear?
Really?

592
00:44:51,723 --> 00:44:53,489
(mocking)
that mush is clear?

593
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:55,725
Have another glass
of fucking wine.

594
00:44:55,727 --> 00:44:58,561
He's an asshole, okay?
He's disgusting.

595
00:44:58,563 --> 00:45:00,063
He's...He's ugly.

596
00:45:00,065 --> 00:45:02,532
No. Not ugly.

597
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:04,200
Fine,
he's steve fucking mcqueen.

598
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:06,836
The point is,
he's helping you
with the mortgage.

599
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:08,404
Gee, I wonder why.

600
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:10,907
( scoffs )
( door slams )

601
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:15,611
( game show droning
on tv )

602
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,094
Harry?

603
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:43,072
Harry?

604
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:45,942
Harry--

605
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:50,713
More coffee?

606
00:45:50,715 --> 00:45:52,949
No, just the check, please.

607
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,001
Sorry.
Billy.

608
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:18,741
( door opens )

609
00:46:18,743 --> 00:46:21,978
Hi there. Excuse me,
I have to pee.

610
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:30,853
Ohh.

611
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:34,924
Oh, god.

612
00:46:34,926 --> 00:46:36,626
( sniffling )

613
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:38,461
God, I was--I--

614
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:40,830
I thought he was
taking a nap.
I know.

615
00:46:40,832 --> 00:46:42,899
I was so worried.
Is he okay?

616
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:44,433
He's fine. He's home.

617
00:46:44,435 --> 00:46:47,103
I--I just--you know,
you just turn around
for a <i>second,</i>

618
00:46:47,105 --> 00:46:48,171
It's like--
sophie.

619
00:46:48,173 --> 00:46:49,872
This isn't gonna work,
is it?

620
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,078
What, you're, uh...

621
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,147
You're just firing me?

622
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,850
What, you didn't think
I would notice?

623
00:47:00,852 --> 00:47:04,587
I can't leave him here
with you like this.

624
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:08,191
And I can't have him
out there.

625
00:47:08,193 --> 00:47:10,259
He's not out there, okay?

626
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:13,296
He wouldn't be
just out there. I--

627
00:47:13,298 --> 00:47:15,331
I can keep him safe.

628
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:21,270
Fine. You know what?
Whatever. Fuck it.

629
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,507
Fuck it.

630
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:45,261
<i>♪ darling, please don't go</i>

631
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:53,102

632
00:47:56,473 --> 00:48:01,377

636
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,448
Do you have a minute?

637
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:52,461
I messed up.

638
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:57,300
I know that.

639
00:48:57,302 --> 00:48:59,368
And...

640
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:03,172
I really need this job.

641
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:06,842
I need to--

642
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:12,815
I promise I'll keep him safe.

643
00:49:12,817 --> 00:49:16,519
Sophie, you can't. You're--
harry: She found my pictures.

644
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:19,455
She did.

645
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:22,658
In the oven.

646
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,661
She found 'em,
like she said.

647
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:29,565
So there it is.

648
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:41,711
Sophie:
Okay, home stretch here.

649
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:46,382
Oh. Um...Gotcha.

650
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:51,020
( chuckles )
sorry.

651
00:49:51,022 --> 00:49:55,958
Don't you have, like, a--
like, a regular...Razor?

652
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,094
Well, that's--

653
00:49:58,096 --> 00:50:01,530
That's navy issue,
about as regular
as they come.

654
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:04,367
Oh....Right.

655
00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:06,035
Hold on.

656
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:36,032
First lieutenant,
second wing.

657
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:38,434
That's you?

658
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:43,139
F-86. Navy pilot.

659
00:50:43,141 --> 00:50:45,975
That's korea.

660
00:50:45,977 --> 00:50:48,544
Two days before
they come with everything.

661
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:56,485
Get to be my age,
most things you can't remember.

662
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:02,258
You think I'm crazy?

663
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,863
No. I don't think
you're crazy, harry.

664
00:51:07,865 --> 00:51:10,733
It's okay.
That's what he told ya.

665
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:15,538
I feel that way anyhow.

666
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,240
But sometimes I'm not.

667
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:22,445
And that's when I'm thinkin'...

668
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:25,548
The pictures in your head...

669
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:29,185
You see...

670
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:32,521
You have to make peace.

671
00:51:32,523 --> 00:51:34,490
Because...

672
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:39,595
Tomorrow is always tomorrow...

673
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:42,031
And...

674
00:51:42,033 --> 00:51:44,467
Today-- here.

675
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:51,240
That's--that's korea.

676
00:51:51,242 --> 00:51:54,410
Two days before
they come with everything.

677
00:51:54,412 --> 00:51:56,512
Like flying all over again.

678
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:07,456
So.

679
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:10,426
What?

680
00:52:10,428 --> 00:52:13,095
You wanna?

681
00:52:13,097 --> 00:52:15,097
No.

682
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:16,599
Why?

683
00:52:16,601 --> 00:52:18,067
Because.

684
00:52:18,069 --> 00:52:20,469
( laughs )

685
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:13,455
Are you gonna
stare at me all night
or are you gonna come in?

686
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:16,425
Pussy.

687
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,632
Man: Hey!

688
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:04,540
Harry: <i>They say at first</i>
<i>it's just the little things.</i>

689
00:54:04,542 --> 00:54:07,710
<i>Names, dates...</i>

690
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:11,247
<i>But then the dates</i>
<i>become years...</i>

691
00:54:11,249 --> 00:54:14,250
<i>Names becomes faces...</i>

692
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:17,019
<i>The faces become whole people,</i>

693
00:54:17,021 --> 00:54:19,622
<i>Like they never even existed.</i>

694
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:28,130
I lied, you know.

695
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,635
When I first met you...

696
00:54:32,637 --> 00:54:35,537
I thought you were cute.

697
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:40,075
But...

698
00:54:40,077 --> 00:54:44,647
To piss off my parents,
you were perfect.

699
00:54:44,649 --> 00:54:46,615
Really.

700
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:50,886
Really.

701
00:54:50,888 --> 00:54:53,756
It was a good plan.

702
00:54:53,758 --> 00:54:55,958
Thank you very much.

703
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:04,033
So what's the plan now?

704
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:07,536
I don't know.

705
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:51,347
( mutters )

706
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:53,215
How's sophie doing?

707
00:55:53,217 --> 00:55:54,683
She got a job.
Oh, yeah?

708
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:57,986
Yep, yep, working for
a retired police officer.

709
00:55:57,988 --> 00:56:00,356
You're kidding.
Who woulda thought, right?

710
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:02,858
Sophie,
talking to the police.

711
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,396
You know...

712
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:11,800
I made those detectives

713
00:56:11,802 --> 00:56:15,237
Talk to every person
that andy knew.

714
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:17,806
Well, you know that,
right?

715
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:23,746
And every single person said...

716
00:56:23,748 --> 00:56:26,081
That no, no,

717
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:27,716
He wouldn't
do that, right?

718
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:31,553
I mean, it was
impossible. No way.

719
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:33,822
I mean, everybody
gave statements.

720
00:56:33,824 --> 00:56:36,558
Everybody except sophie.

721
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:43,665
Well, you know, the, uh...

722
00:56:43,667 --> 00:56:47,269
The insurance company's decision
isn't final, caroline.

723
00:56:47,271 --> 00:56:49,838
If she were...
To remember something,

724
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,107
Anything at all...
Believe me, I know.

725
00:56:52,109 --> 00:56:54,943
All I'm saying is,
it's a lot of money.

726
00:56:54,945 --> 00:56:57,546
What, you don't think
I've asked her?

727
00:56:57,548 --> 00:57:00,115
I've asked her,
therapists have asked her,

728
00:57:00,117 --> 00:57:03,018
There's no--
there's just--

729
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,254
There's nothing.

730
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:13,395
You're just gonna
have to face it.

731
00:57:13,397 --> 00:57:15,898
Sophie: Harry?

732
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,767
I'm your father.

733
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,702
Who are you
talking to?

734
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,973
We don't have to tell her.

735
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,815
Harry, you want to
sit down for a minute?

736
00:57:32,817 --> 00:57:33,949
Hmm.

737
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:39,822
Bernice wants
to tell her.

738
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:42,124
She <i>insists</i>
<i>that we tell her.</i>

739
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:50,532
That's hers.

740
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:53,402
That's lucy's.

741
00:57:53,404 --> 00:57:54,736
See?

742
00:57:54,738 --> 00:57:57,940
It's beautiful.
Yeah.

743
00:57:57,942 --> 00:58:00,943
You look
a lot like her...

744
00:58:00,945 --> 00:58:03,145
My lucy.

745
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:06,849
Yes. Okay, no. What else?

746
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:13,755
( sighs ) no,
I did not lose the list.

747
00:58:13,757 --> 00:58:17,493
Because I'm looking at it!
I have it right here
in my hand!

748
00:58:17,495 --> 00:58:18,861
I have to go.

749
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:26,502
Thank you.

750
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:31,874
Ahh.

751
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,678
You hung up on her,
didn't you?

752
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,681
Yep.

753
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:43,519
Yep, andy was always
at the gym too.

754
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:50,959
Okay, so, what's your big plan?

755
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:55,197
Have you ever thought about
selling andy's shares
in conway jennings?

756
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:57,833
I don't know. How much
do you think they're worth?

757
00:58:57,835 --> 00:59:00,536
I don't know.
I'd have to see.

758
00:59:00,538 --> 00:59:05,040
Okay, well...Why don't you
go ahead and do that?

759
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,709
Well, maybe I will.
Okay, then.

760
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:10,279
Okay, fine.
Okay.

761
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,390
Oh.

762
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:22,925
Where are my keys?

763
00:59:22,927 --> 00:59:25,060
Sophie: Harry.
Where are my keys?

764
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:26,595
Where--huh?
Sit down.

765
00:59:26,597 --> 00:59:28,330
It's almost time for
your morning show.

766
00:59:28,332 --> 00:59:31,099
Where are my <i>keys?!!</i>
<i>I can't let you leave.</i>

767
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:35,404
I can't be late for work!
Please, give me my keys!
Calm down, it's okay.

768
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:38,907
I know you--I know
you took my keys!
Harry.

769
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:41,443
I know you did!
I'll take you.

770
00:59:41,445 --> 00:59:43,912
I'm begging you.
Everything's gonna
be all right.

771
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:45,581
Okay.
Okay?

772
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:47,449
Yeah, no.
I'll take you.

773
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:49,017
Yeah.
Okay?

774
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:50,519
Okay.

775
00:59:50,521 --> 00:59:52,454
Okay.
Take your coat.

776
00:59:52,456 --> 00:59:54,356
Yeah.

777
00:59:54,358 --> 00:59:56,725
( sighs )
my keys.

778
00:59:56,727 --> 00:59:58,393
Huh?
You don't have to drive.

779
00:59:58,395 --> 01:00:01,630
I'm gonna drive. Okay?
Okay.

780
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:04,700
Okay.

781
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,671
Watch your step.
Bye.

782
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:14,142
Harry: Where--
where we goin'?

783
01:00:14,144 --> 01:00:17,813
Sophie: Harry,
it's a surprise.

784
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:34,162
Harry:
They called us "the aces."

785
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:43,271
You see, the wing
break away from the plane...

786
01:00:43,273 --> 01:00:47,409
Catch up with the truth
pretty quick, you know
you're comin' down with it.

787
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:55,017
In a flash,
it's all around you,

788
01:00:55,019 --> 01:00:58,286
The thunder...

789
01:00:58,288 --> 01:01:01,523
Bumblebees in the sky...

790
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:11,033
You land there in the water...

791
01:01:11,035 --> 01:01:14,069
And it's...Quiet.

792
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:22,044
Like sinking under the knives...

793
01:01:22,046 --> 01:01:26,014
Over and over again,
dull knives against your...

794
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:28,450
Legs and your arms.

795
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:34,289
Like big waves
cutting you down.

796
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:40,629
Had to try...

797
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,400
Really try just to breathe.

798
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:50,138
Well, eventually you...

799
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:53,108
You give in, you stop.

800
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:58,980
And you never forget.

801
01:01:58,982 --> 01:02:02,150
The parachute...

802
01:02:02,152 --> 01:02:05,587
Through the parachute
I could see the surface...

803
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:09,024
The carrier on fire...

804
01:02:09,026 --> 01:02:11,326
A little warm...

805
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:15,797
And then it turned over.

806
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:21,069
And something...

807
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:24,806
Something inside me...

808
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:31,446
Harry,
are you okay?

809
01:02:31,448 --> 01:02:35,751
I finally surfaced with
everything I had left.

810
01:02:35,753 --> 01:02:39,121
And the bombs and explosions
all around me

811
01:02:39,123 --> 01:02:42,891
Like a million sunrises
all at once.

812
01:02:42,893 --> 01:02:45,360
And you never do...

813
01:02:45,362 --> 01:02:48,230
You never do...

814
01:02:48,232 --> 01:02:50,132
Forget...

815
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:58,039
The beauty.

816
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:01,943
The beauty.

817
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:09,117
You never want to forget.

818
01:03:11,654 --> 01:03:13,088
<i>( line ringing )</i>

819
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:15,490
Steven: <i>Hi, this is steven.</i>

820
01:03:15,492 --> 01:03:18,360
<i>Leave a message</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

821
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:22,998
I missed him.

822
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,669
I'm mean, I didn't really
know it till...I saw him,

823
01:03:27,671 --> 01:03:29,638
But I did.

824
01:03:31,841 --> 01:03:35,076
So...How are you?

825
01:03:35,078 --> 01:03:36,845
How's kevin?

826
01:03:36,847 --> 01:03:39,815
No kevin. Mm-mm.

827
01:03:39,817 --> 01:03:42,584
Maybe for a second,
but no.

828
01:03:42,586 --> 01:03:46,788
Um, I mean, he sees
annie on the weekends,

829
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:48,957
And he's a great dad,

830
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:50,959
But he's...
He's just not--

831
01:03:50,961 --> 01:03:53,862
Who's not? You guys
talking about me?

832
01:03:53,864 --> 01:03:56,164
( laughs )

833
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:58,200
Cheers.
No.

834
01:03:58,202 --> 01:03:59,367
Not at all?
No.

835
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:13,515
Shot!

836
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:15,584
All right,
I gotta pee.

837
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:24,125
Ohh. I'm done.

838
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:38,473
Sophie?

839
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:41,476
Hey.

840
01:04:41,478 --> 01:04:42,978
Benji.

841
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,145
You're here.

842
01:04:44,147 --> 01:04:47,549
Yeah, we're doing
irish car bombs,

843
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:51,386
Just drop a shot of whiskey
in a glass of beer
and chug it.

844
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:53,922
It's like a big shot,
if you want to join us.

845
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:04,266
Will you take me home?

846
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:22,484
Billy: Soph!

847
01:05:23,786 --> 01:05:25,654
Sophie!

848
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:28,323
Soph!

849
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:30,926
We can't.

850
01:05:30,928 --> 01:05:33,328
It's all I think about.

851
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:56,551
You want me?

852
01:05:56,553 --> 01:05:59,654
Jesus christ, yes.
Okay, I want you.

853
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:10,398
( moaning )

854
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:20,375
Take this off.
Take this off.

855
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:27,582
( moaning )

856
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,294
Oh!

857
01:06:39,296 --> 01:06:41,396
Oh, yes.

858
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:52,640
Just--just stop,
all right?

859
01:06:52,642 --> 01:06:55,110
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

860
01:06:55,112 --> 01:06:57,412
Just take me home.

861
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:00,482
( zipping pants )

862
01:07:00,484 --> 01:07:02,450
Oh...

863
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:06,454
Okay.

864
01:07:06,456 --> 01:07:08,523
All right,
I'll call ya.

865
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:10,692
All right.
All right?

866
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:18,366
( sighs )

867
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:43,224
How was your night?

868
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:48,029
Good.
How was yours?

869
01:07:48,031 --> 01:07:51,399
Warren beatty was on leno.

870
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:53,468
Really.
Mm-hmm.

871
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,748
( knocking )

872
01:08:08,017 --> 01:08:10,351
You clean up good,
harry.

873
01:08:10,353 --> 01:08:14,255
Oh, yeah, well...(laughs)...
I thought I'd try it on.

874
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:17,459
Are we, uh, are we
going somewhere special?

875
01:08:17,461 --> 01:08:19,928
No, not me. Lucy.

876
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:23,231
Every year she comes
on my birthday,

877
01:08:23,233 --> 01:08:28,803
And, uh, sometimes--
sometimes she dances with me.

878
01:08:28,805 --> 01:08:30,538
( knock on door )

879
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:39,881
I don't want
to talk to you.

880
01:08:39,883 --> 01:08:41,449
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

881
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:44,986
I think you should leave.
No.

882
01:08:44,988 --> 01:08:48,823
I'm still here, sophie.

883
01:08:48,825 --> 01:08:51,126
I'm still here.

884
01:08:51,128 --> 01:08:53,294
I'm not the one who leaves.

885
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:58,766
And that's my fault how?

886
01:08:58,768 --> 01:09:00,435
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

887
01:09:00,437 --> 01:09:02,670
Then what are you saying?

888
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:10,645
I love you.

889
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:14,716
You do?

890
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:20,021
Why?

891
01:09:22,591 --> 01:09:24,492
Because I do.

892
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:29,097
Well, I don't love you.

893
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:32,500
I don't.

894
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:45,180
Except I know you do.

895
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:08,603
( rings doorbell )

896
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:14,576
Sorry about that,
harry.

897
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:20,648
It's because
she can't have kids. Bernice.

898
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:25,687
We've been trying for years.

899
01:10:25,689 --> 01:10:28,489
Now she wants to adopt.

900
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:31,659
Harry:
And you talk about
these things--

901
01:10:31,661 --> 01:10:35,897
Suddenly find yourself
talking about these things,

902
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:39,267
All these things you never
wanted to talk about.

903
01:10:40,603 --> 01:10:43,471
Should we not tell her?

904
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:46,674
My lucy?

905
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:54,616
When the time is right...

906
01:10:54,618 --> 01:10:56,584
But it's never right.

907
01:10:58,954 --> 01:11:01,155
It's never the time.

908
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:06,461
And my advance,
when can I expect that?

909
01:11:06,463 --> 01:11:08,596
Within 24 hours.
Oh.

910
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:10,431
Right here.

911
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:13,134
She's my lucy.

912
01:11:13,136 --> 01:11:16,304
She's <i>my</i> lucy.

913
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:21,709
Now the mother
wants to meet her
and say hello,

914
01:11:21,711 --> 01:11:24,479
And I'm not even
her real father.

915
01:11:24,481 --> 01:11:27,715
Harry:
Lyin' to everyone
all these years...

916
01:11:27,717 --> 01:11:30,618
Here I am
trying to make the rules.

917
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:36,724
Be careful.
Look both ways!
( tires screeching )

918
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:48,736
If your father
was not the person
you thought he was,

919
01:11:48,738 --> 01:11:50,838
Is that something
you'd want to know?

920
01:11:55,944 --> 01:11:58,980
My father's dead.
He died.

921
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:06,154
Do you remember him?

922
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:12,160
You see?

923
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:16,264
That's what I'm afraid of.

924
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:36,017
( car door closes )

925
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:42,523
It was me and you.

926
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:46,060
It was supposed to be
me and you getting
out of this town,

927
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:47,962
And then what,
I miss a pill?

928
01:12:47,964 --> 01:12:49,697
I don't even know.

929
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:54,369
What I do know is that

930
01:12:54,371 --> 01:12:58,706
It wasn't me and you anymore,
sophie; it was you.

931
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:02,310
I wanted one thing
that you had,

932
01:13:02,312 --> 01:13:05,913
And the only thing
that you left behind...

933
01:13:05,915 --> 01:13:07,815
Was billy.

934
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,720
He doesn't want me.

935
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:19,060
He wants you. He has
always wanted <i>you.</i>

936
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:26,334
You gotta believe me.

937
01:13:26,336 --> 01:13:28,603
I'm sorry.

938
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,641
I'm so sorry.

939
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,944
Milla.

940
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:41,749
( sighs deeply )

941
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:46,521
I don't know what to do.

942
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:49,791
( laughs )

943
01:13:49,793 --> 01:13:51,793
( laughs )

944
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:01,202
Do you love him?

945
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:19,887
( revving engine )

946
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,527
Soph.

947
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:30,932
Hey.

948
01:14:30,934 --> 01:14:32,500
Hey.

949
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:38,306
So...

950
01:14:38,308 --> 01:14:41,242
I think I have it
all figured out.

951
01:14:41,244 --> 01:14:43,811
The, uh, the plan.

952
01:14:47,749 --> 01:14:50,017
Come with me to new york.

953
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:58,693
Why won't you?

954
01:15:01,763 --> 01:15:04,365
That man you work for...

955
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:09,537
Yeah?

956
01:15:09,539 --> 01:15:11,339
Harry pleasant.

957
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:15,943
His daughter.

958
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:20,848
Lucy?

959
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:26,854
You wanted to know
what he did, my dad.

960
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:35,029
When that girl
was twenty-one,

961
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:38,866
Lucy...

962
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:40,868
He hit her.

963
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:45,907
He was drunk.

964
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:49,877
Doesn't even
remember it.

965
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:56,651
He hit her with this car.

966
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:03,658
<i>This</i> car.

967
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:05,826
And she died.

968
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:11,866
I tell everyone
that he's a loser.

969
01:16:11,868 --> 01:16:13,901
I tell everyone
that I hate him.

970
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:18,940
None of that's true.

971
01:16:18,942 --> 01:16:20,975
I don't hate him.

972
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:26,614
Maybe he's never
gonna come home.

973
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:32,353
He's probably not
gonna ever come home.

974
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:39,994
But I don't hate him.

975
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:49,870
I miss him.

976
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:54,675
I really miss him.

977

978
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:12,059
I love you.

I wasn't here...

980
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:24,338
Even when
I couldn't say it.

982
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:37,084
You're not him, billy.

983
01:17:43,258 --> 01:17:45,359
We're not them.

984

01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:59,046
I'm thinking of
redoing the room.

1079
01:26:59,048 --> 01:27:01,648
(slurring) maybe
a little more modern.

1080
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:03,483
What do you think?

1081
01:27:07,088 --> 01:27:10,591
I think you're...Drunk.

1082
01:27:10,593 --> 01:27:14,328
Yeah, I guess I am.
Want to know why?

1083
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:18,232
I don't know.
Because it's a Wednesday?

1084
01:27:18,234 --> 01:27:20,567
No, I'm--

1085
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:24,104
I'm drunk because
I'm all alone.

1086
01:27:25,506 --> 01:27:29,776
And pretty soon...
<i>Very</i> soon...

1087
01:27:29,778 --> 01:27:35,182
I'm gonna be all alone with
no place to <i>be</i> all alone.

1088
01:27:35,184 --> 01:27:36,917
What do you mean?

1089
01:27:38,886 --> 01:27:41,488
You were right
about steven, honey.

1090
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:46,360
It was all a big lie.

1091
01:27:46,362 --> 01:27:49,029
And I signed off on it.

1092
01:27:50,865 --> 01:27:52,599
( sighs )

1093
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:58,038
Remember this jacket?

1094
01:27:59,574 --> 01:28:01,508
It was your daddy's.

1095
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:04,645
Mmm.

1096
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:08,649
He always wore it
to the ballet, remember?

1097
01:28:11,152 --> 01:28:14,655
You said we wouldn't
talk about him.

1098
01:28:14,657 --> 01:28:16,857
I'm all alone here, sophie.

1099
01:28:26,267 --> 01:28:28,602
I can't fix this.

1100
01:28:28,604 --> 01:28:31,305
What do you want from me?

1101
01:28:31,307 --> 01:28:35,208
You mean other than acting
like you could give a shit?

1102
01:28:36,744 --> 01:28:38,745
Okay.

1103
01:28:43,117 --> 01:28:47,187
Those questions
that they asked you
were not all that--

1104
01:28:47,189 --> 01:28:49,690
No, no. I'm not going
back into it, mom.

1105
01:28:49,692 --> 01:28:52,592
Sophie, just--
just--just listen.

1106
01:28:52,594 --> 01:28:55,262
You said
you wouldn't do this.

1107
01:28:57,699 --> 01:29:00,267
That insurance money...

1108
01:29:00,269 --> 01:29:02,269
I <i>need</i> money--
you said you wouldn't do this.

1109
01:29:02,271 --> 01:29:03,837
I know.
Mom, you said you wouldn't.

1110
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:05,672
I know, I know, I know.

1111
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:07,708
Just if there was something
that you could tell them.

1112
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:08,709
There's not!

1113
01:29:08,711 --> 01:29:10,677
(stammering )
a statement, anything,

1114
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:14,014
If they could just ask you
a few questions,
a few more questions.

1115
01:29:14,016 --> 01:29:17,617
I've already told you
there's nothing to remember,
and that is <i>never</i> gonna change!

1116
01:29:17,619 --> 01:29:20,687
I need that fucking money.

1117
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:24,024
That's fine.

1118
01:29:25,393 --> 01:29:26,827
No, it's fine.

1119
01:29:26,829 --> 01:29:28,829
I'll just sell it all.
Is that what you want?

1120
01:29:28,831 --> 01:29:32,466
Everything we have
to the highest bidder.

1121
01:29:32,468 --> 01:29:33,767
That's fine.

1122
01:29:35,069 --> 01:29:38,305
Honey, please, I just--

1123
01:29:38,307 --> 01:29:41,775
All...All they want to know...

1124
01:29:46,314 --> 01:29:48,815
All they want to know...

1125
01:29:48,817 --> 01:29:51,151
Is that you saw him, honey.

1126
01:29:51,153 --> 01:29:53,820
You--you saw, right?

1127
01:29:53,822 --> 01:29:56,189
And he was...

1128
01:29:56,191 --> 01:29:59,593
He was okay, he was--
he was fine.

1129
01:29:59,595 --> 01:30:01,995
I mean, he wasn't...

1130
01:30:01,997 --> 01:30:04,564
He wasn't suicidal,
for god's sake,

1131
01:30:04,566 --> 01:30:07,734
I mean, that wasn't--
that wasn't daddy.

1132
01:30:15,176 --> 01:30:16,843
What?

1133
01:30:20,181 --> 01:30:23,417
What?
I wanted it
to be a surprise...

1134
01:30:23,419 --> 01:30:27,187
<i>So I came home early.</i>

1135
01:30:27,189 --> 01:30:29,856
<i>I saw a light on in the barn.</i>

1136
01:30:36,697 --> 01:30:38,331
( coughing in distance )

1137
01:30:41,736 --> 01:30:43,603
( man sobbing )

1138
01:30:57,084 --> 01:30:59,252
I didn't even...

1139
01:30:59,254 --> 01:31:02,456
Know that dad had a gun.

1140
01:31:05,326 --> 01:31:07,794
He told me that he loved me.

1141
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:12,799
And that I was...
A good girl.

1142
01:31:16,971 --> 01:31:19,973
And he told me to go inside.

1143
01:31:19,975 --> 01:31:22,576
And I said,
"no matter what it is,

1144
01:31:22,578 --> 01:31:24,744
We can just forget about it
and start over."

1145
01:31:24,746 --> 01:31:26,980
No, I don't believe you.
You're lying.

1146
01:31:26,982 --> 01:31:28,982
Then he asked me
where you were.

1147
01:31:28,984 --> 01:31:30,784
Ha. I was at dinner.

1148
01:31:30,786 --> 01:31:33,453
No, you weren't.

1149
01:31:33,455 --> 01:31:36,089
I saw you.

1150
01:31:36,091 --> 01:31:39,259

1151
01:31:39,261 --> 01:31:41,761

Whoa!

1154
01:31:52,807 --> 01:31:54,975
What are you saying?

1155
01:31:54,977 --> 01:31:59,045
You were always with him.
Dad knew.

1156
01:31:59,047 --> 01:32:00,881
Shut up!

1157
01:32:04,552 --> 01:32:09,523
I told him that
if he was gonna do it
that he should do it...

1158
01:32:09,525 --> 01:32:12,559
Operator: <i>911. Please</i>

1159

He was sick, honey.

It wasn't your fault.
You couldn't have stopped him.

1185

You couldn't have,
