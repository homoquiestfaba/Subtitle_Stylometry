1
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,947
Park over there

2
00:00:19,462 --> 00:00:20,190
move away

3
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,194
Don't' touch me

4
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:22,696
The police ask you
to move away your hand

5
00:00:22,832 --> 00:00:23,730
l told you not to touch me

6
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:24,924
lt's none of your bloody business

7
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:25,864
Step aside

8
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:26,900
Did l break the law?

9
00:00:30,206 --> 00:00:30,934
You can complain.

10
00:00:31,975 --> 00:00:33,408
You better watch yourself.

11
00:00:38,448 --> 00:00:39,380
My car!

12
00:00:55,632 --> 00:00:56,564
Follow him

13
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:58,359
Got it

14
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:16,847
Action

15
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:18,053
Got it

16
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,139
Stop the car

17
00:01:48,685 --> 00:01:49,743
Stop the car

18
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:12,471
lt's enough

19
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,802
Quiet

20
00:02:19,615 --> 00:02:20,547
Bull

21
00:02:28,257 --> 00:02:30,657
Get in the car

22
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:34,489
Ah!

23
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:38,629
Of course it's OK

24
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:40,832
Didn't you trust my driving skill?

25
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:46,364
l leave it here, you sent somebody here

26
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:50,807
l gave you all l got

27
00:02:52,115 --> 00:02:56,108
lt's you, l told you not fooling around
Now, it's screw up

28
00:02:56,252 --> 00:02:57,549
Are you blind? Don't you see it?

29
00:02:57,687 --> 00:02:58,779
That police blamed your sister-in-law

30
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:00,388
lt's his luck that l didn't kill him.

31
00:03:00,656 --> 00:03:02,920
That's because you hate police,
why you say it's me?

32
00:03:03,326 --> 00:03:04,588
Especially you.

33
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,354
l did it for you and you still complain me.

34
00:03:07,463 --> 00:03:07,929
Are you complaining me?

35
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:08,996
No

36
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:10,190
You are here

37
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,732
l go downstairs to watch the shop

38
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,298
Let's kiss

39
00:03:15,138 --> 00:03:17,902
To watch the shop, be smart

40
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,836
Let's kiss

41
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:21,099
Don't mess up my lipstick

42
00:03:21,811 --> 00:03:27,249
No kiss, don't fool around,
l got to go to work

43
00:03:29,685 --> 00:03:30,879
You are bad

44
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,448
Oh yeah?

45
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:33,850
You have to pay me back if l am late

46
00:03:34,657 --> 00:03:35,749
Don't go to work

47
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:37,621
You take care of me?

48
00:03:38,127 --> 00:03:39,287
Can't l take care of you?

49
00:03:39,662 --> 00:03:41,425
l eat a lot

50
00:03:41,664 --> 00:03:43,029
l got a lot of money

51
00:03:44,534 --> 00:03:46,092
Let's get marry

52
00:03:54,243 --> 00:03:57,838
Why do you always talk
about the marriage? lt's no different

53
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,038
Of course you say it's no different.

54
00:03:59,182 --> 00:04:01,514
You didn't care anything

55
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:02,777
Don't say it

56
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:07,547
Hey!

57
00:04:17,867 --> 00:04:20,131
Big brother, a police is fighting with us

58
00:04:20,403 --> 00:04:21,165
What are you fighting for?

59
00:04:22,238 --> 00:04:23,330
Big brother, he insults you

60
00:04:23,673 --> 00:04:26,437
How did you hear this message?
That's what Leopard said

61
00:04:26,576 --> 00:04:27,873
l cannot suffer what you said

62
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:30,309
Leopard said your driving
skill was poor.

63
00:04:30,546 --> 00:04:32,411
He asked you not to go
to Tsimshatsui anymore

64
00:04:32,682 --> 00:04:35,549
He also said you
dared not to race with him

65
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:40,422
That's what he said? What is his price?

66
00:04:40,556 --> 00:04:42,046
Forty thousand dollars per person.

67
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:45,317
lf you agree, l can take care half of it.

68
00:04:48,231 --> 00:04:50,995
You want to take advantage from me

69
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:54,532
Am l that kind of person?

70
00:04:55,137 --> 00:04:56,069
Stop saying nonsense

71
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:58,167
l can't stop you if you want to die

72
00:04:59,242 --> 00:05:00,800
lf you are interested,

73
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:04,279
You can pay my half first

74
00:05:06,382 --> 00:05:07,246
Don't you trust me?

75
00:05:07,383 --> 00:05:08,350
Don't say that

76
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:10,714
Let's fix it

77
00:05:11,654 --> 00:05:12,678
l'll reply Leopard

78
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:14,078
Ok, go for it

79
00:05:14,223 --> 00:05:15,656
Bye

80
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:20,993
Why didn't you help Bull
when he fought with somebody else?

81
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,228
l went to tell you

82
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:23,992
You could shout

83
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,129
What would happen if they fight?

84
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,433
You always shout if nothing happen

85
00:05:33,175 --> 00:05:34,301
You are the same, Bull

86
00:05:34,677 --> 00:05:35,939
You always fight with others
for minor points

87
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:38,711
They came for advantage that l agree.

88
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:41,180
What would happen
if we fight for other points?

89
00:05:41,317 --> 00:05:43,080
This is our place

90
00:05:43,586 --> 00:05:44,848
lt is hard to suffer

91
00:05:46,422 --> 00:05:50,552
You always say it's hard to suffer.

92
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,522
Brother,
you remember mom liked sugar cake

93
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:55,290
Of course l remember

94
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,502
l will come to see you next year, mom.

95
00:06:07,643 --> 00:06:09,042
Let's clean up, it's a mess.

96
00:06:09,178 --> 00:06:12,170
No. l don't want to see that bastard.
Let's go

97
00:06:12,315 --> 00:06:13,577
You wait me downstairs

98
00:06:13,883 --> 00:06:14,747
OK

99
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:19,653
Dad

100
00:06:20,022 --> 00:06:21,455
l'll be downstairs

101
00:06:24,026 --> 00:06:25,357
Bastard

102
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:31,260
Ann, happy birthday

103
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:33,433
lt's not my birthday

104
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:36,037
l know, next month is your birthday

105
00:06:36,305 --> 00:06:38,068
l don't know when l can see you

106
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:39,874
You can call me at my store

107
00:06:40,343 --> 00:06:43,676
No, you can go now

108
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:47,241
l don't want the bastard thinks that
l am talking about his faults

109
00:07:00,096 --> 00:07:01,529
What?

110
00:07:01,864 --> 00:07:02,728
What's it?

111
00:07:02,865 --> 00:07:04,196
Birthday gift

112
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:05,661
Why did you take it from the bastard?

113
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:06,927
Are you jealous?

114
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,233
Watch out

115
00:07:12,441 --> 00:07:14,170
lt's for fun

116
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,039
l would say you like to show off

117
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:18,203
l have nothing too proud of.

118
00:07:18,514 --> 00:07:20,038
l only proud of my driving skill

119
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:22,613
You better kill me
if l am not allowed to race

120
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:24,413
You have said it ten thousand times.

121
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,015
Don't you eat everyday?

122
00:07:28,724 --> 00:07:31,284
l will race at
Princess Margaret Road two days later.

123
00:07:31,427 --> 00:07:32,325
Will you come?

124
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:34,429
l have seen it before, nothing special.

125
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,561
lt's not the same;
the bet will be forty thousand dollars

126
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:39,058
l let you to see
my driving skill more clearly.

127
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:40,892
Forty thousands?
Who is the opponent?

128
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:42,770
A racer of Explosion.

129
00:07:43,305 --> 00:07:45,000
l don't know which one

130
00:08:04,593 --> 00:08:06,493
Joe, let's work

131
00:08:06,996 --> 00:08:10,397
You have been staring at your wife.
Didn't you stare enough?

132
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,298
Do you cough?

133
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:19,703
Why do you always drink this stuff?

134
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:24,539
Old Guy,
what you think about that racer?

135
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,669
No

136
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:27,107
What you mean by no

137
00:08:27,516 --> 00:08:29,245
Explosion didn't ask you to be his racer

138
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:30,852
lt's only a game, no big deal

139
00:08:30,986 --> 00:08:33,682
You don't have to race.
You can have money to buy new tire if we win.

140
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:38,357
What you think?

141
00:08:39,795 --> 00:08:40,454
OK

142
00:08:40,596 --> 00:08:42,860
We are doing business in this garage

143
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:46,067
These guys are not good nature.
We better not to deal with them

144
00:08:46,202 --> 00:08:47,601
Put your hands off

145
00:08:49,939 --> 00:08:53,431
Joe, you use to race

146
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:55,037
Now,
you have a chance to race with others

147
00:08:55,177 --> 00:08:56,667
why don't you response?

148
00:08:57,847 --> 00:08:58,677
lt is good if

149
00:08:58,814 --> 00:09:01,214
l can race in Macao

150
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,910
Yes, let's go to Macao first,
then we go to Philippines

151
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:05,653
Yes, this is the way to do it

152
00:09:22,738 --> 00:09:24,535
Joe, we opened this garage

153
00:09:24,673 --> 00:09:26,197
Because we want to get fame in Macao

154
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:28,233
lt is good for business

155
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:29,767
Joe, you should show us your idea.

156
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:31,403
Don't ask me

157
00:09:32,181 --> 00:09:35,446
The garage belongs to us.
l can't make decision

158
00:09:35,985 --> 00:09:36,849
That's right

159
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:38,343
What's right?

160
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:41,613
OK, what are you fighting for?

161
00:09:42,158 --> 00:09:44,718
The most important thing is
to test the car.

162
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:53,531
That bastard comes every week

163
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:56,402
He probably crashed on the way

164
00:09:58,174 --> 00:09:59,141
Here he is

165
00:10:27,603 --> 00:10:28,695
Let's start

166
00:10:42,918 --> 00:10:45,512
That country boy
is driving a garbage truck and screwing around

167
00:10:47,556 --> 00:10:50,787
Let's see his stuff

168
00:11:24,293 --> 00:11:25,351
This monster seems OK.

169
00:11:25,494 --> 00:11:26,927
Reverse slow tire

170
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:27,892
and slick tire,

171
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,362
The side vents are bigger than a table

172
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:33,697
lt is shame to race with this monster.

173
00:11:33,836 --> 00:11:35,997
Don't play with him, let's go.

174
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,524
Joe, the car can't stand it.

175
00:11:58,661 --> 00:11:59,923
They have reset the parts;

176
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:03,494
it's no way. Don't chase them.

177
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,161
l asked you not to go reluctantly

178
00:12:09,305 --> 00:12:11,330
You didn't hear what l said.
Now, we blew up.

179
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:20,514
We lost everything;

180
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:22,779
the side vents have gone.

181
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:24,518
Brother, it's only testing.

182
00:12:24,653 --> 00:12:28,214
Don't go too far. We don't need a hero

183
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:30,387
You never listen to me.

184
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:33,886
l will fix it

185
00:12:36,565 --> 00:12:40,729
Let's go to gas station

186
00:12:43,372 --> 00:12:44,168
We finish work today

187
00:13:18,607 --> 00:13:19,733
lt seems that you must win

You've have never heard about him?

196
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:39,185
Do we have to give him 20% off?

You like soft drink?

00:14:21,036 --> 00:14:23,937
Explosion,
your racer doesn't want to show up

206
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:25,472
What is the use for coming early?

207
00:14:25,607 --> 00:14:27,575
He doesn't want to show up
even though he can take advantage

208
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:28,733
Explosion

209
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:31,044

210
00:14:31,447 --> 00:14:34,245

No

216
00:14:45,294 --> 00:14:48,491
Explosion, bring your racer here

217
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,958

222
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:02,404
Explosion didn't say

You can give up right now

224
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:08,640
Are you saying that
you want to give up?

225
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:12,049
l am scared that
l got no money even if l win.

226
00:15:14,223 --> 00:15:15,588
Give me money. Give me money

227
00:15:18,393 --> 00:15:20,987
Lui, give me money, half of it

228
00:15:22,364 --> 00:15:24,093
Why do you pretend innocent?
We have a deal, you pay first.

00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:27,134
Twenty thousands, twenty thousand

230
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:28,793

Bastard, you want to go overhead?
Let's go to heaven together

241
00:19:24,406 --> 00:19:27,239
No way, how did you drive?

242
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:28,305
What?

243
00:19:28,744 --> 00:19:29,438
You crashed me?

244
00:19:29,578 --> 00:19:31,978
Crash you?
l should ask you how did you drive

245
00:19:32,114 --> 00:19:33,274
Why did you let me crash?

246
00:19:35,684 --> 00:19:36,708
What? Arguing with me?

247
00:19:36,852 --> 00:19:37,944
Did you follow the rule?

248
00:19:38,453 --> 00:19:39,215
What rule?

249
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,718
What are you doing?

250
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:51,097
Don't fight. Don't fight

251
00:19:53,502 --> 00:19:55,493
You blocked my way and crash me.
Should it be counted?

252
00:19:55,771 --> 00:19:58,069
Why should it be counted?
lt's an accident. No count.

253
00:19:58,306 --> 00:20:00,433
You said the final point is highway.
l am the winner

254
00:20:00,675 --> 00:20:01,505
Don't be proud

255
00:20:01,643 --> 00:20:03,235
My car is at front.
Your car is at rear. l am the winner

256
00:20:06,381 --> 00:20:08,474
l don't care. You fix it yourself

257
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:11,552
Somebody is robbing my money

258
00:20:19,528 --> 00:20:21,462
Police! Let's go

259
00:20:26,635 --> 00:20:27,659

262
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:13,376
Sir, l went for a walk

263
00:21:13,515 --> 00:21:14,880
You think that l am a nut.

264
00:21:15,016 --> 00:21:16,506
Even though a nut knows
that you were racing

265
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:20,815
You have said it.
Only a nut thinks that l raced

266
00:21:23,024 --> 00:21:26,118
Sir, you seem normal.
Don't look like a nut

267
00:21:26,962 --> 00:21:30,159
What are you laughing at?

268
00:21:30,632 --> 00:21:33,294
Sir, you have misunderstood me

269
00:21:33,635 --> 00:21:35,398
Everybody laugh at the people
who is poor, not the ''Cheung''(hooker)

270
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:41,002
You got a ''Cheung''(gun );
we dare not to laugh at you.

271
00:21:41,142 --> 00:21:42,234
Don't be slick

272
00:21:42,377 --> 00:21:43,901
Don't fool around with me

273
00:21:45,413 --> 00:21:48,507

Turn around and face to me

274

00:21:57,225 --> 00:21:58,783
Do you have a hearing problem?
Uncle Fei

276
00:21:59,895 --> 00:22:03,490
You better wait for my lawyer.
Take your times and enjoy your tea

277
00:22:03,632 --> 00:22:05,930
This is police station. Behave yourself

278
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:09,568
You can charge me
if you have enough proof

279
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:11,001
You don't have to give me face

280
00:22:13,408 --> 00:22:14,170
Bastard

281
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:14,898
Hey

282
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,670
Hey, you think that police got powers?

283
00:22:17,178 --> 00:22:17,644
Don't do anything foolish

284
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:19,337
l will prosecute you

285
00:22:19,481 --> 00:22:21,711
Don't stop me to teach my son.
You race illegally.

286

You get your sister arrested

287
00:22:23,785 --> 00:22:26,185
lt is your business if you wanted to be
rotten, why did you implicate your sister?

288
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:27,515
Who race illegally?

289
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:30,319
Do you have proof?
You can't malicious accuse me.

290
00:22:30,592 --> 00:22:31,684
Stop shouting

291
00:22:31,993 --> 00:22:32,891
Your sister is angry with you

292
00:22:33,028 --> 00:22:34,325
You want to play an act in the public?

293
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,524
OK, l play an act for you

294
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,657
You are suspected to race illegally,
we can arrest you.

295
00:22:40,802 --> 00:22:42,292
What did you say?
Are you working in this region?

296
00:22:42,637 --> 00:22:43,433
Do you have rights to charge me?

297
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:44,664
Shut up

298
00:22:45,173 --> 00:22:47,266

Don't bet him, it only takes 48 hours

303
00:22:56,618 --> 00:22:57,778
This is not the first time

304
00:23:00,221 --> 00:23:02,553
You are great.
Before lCAC was set up

305
00:23:02,691 --> 00:23:05,524
You are just a cop

306
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,890
You used to collect dirty money
with me when l was litter

307
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:09,428
Not to pay after eaten

308
00:23:09,564 --> 00:23:10,462

You are afraid that l will say everything

315
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,175
Colleague, send him to prison

Do you want to arrest me?

320

00:23:53,908 --> 00:23:58,936
l was wrong.
This matter will be never ended

327
00:23:59,547 --> 00:24:00,980
You go to find Bull

328
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:03,380
He will take care of you.
You will be OK

329
00:24:03,518 --> 00:24:04,985
Hmm...

Ann, l want to talk to you

331
00:24:14,629 --> 00:24:15,789
l don't want to listen

00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:17,627
Ann

333
00:24:20,935 --> 00:24:25,235
lt's none of my business.

334
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:29,943
l regret to ask you to come.
l did expect you'd behave like this

335
00:24:30,078 --> 00:24:32,046
l half opened my eyes

336
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:35,777
Now, his sister is involved in it

337
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:40,150
l must send him in prison
if l have power

338
00:25:07,248 --> 00:25:08,306
You go first

339
00:25:16,925 --> 00:25:17,914
Let's go

340
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:24,258
Stop the car. Stop the car

341
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:26,265

00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:32,103
Hey, what are you doing?

345
00:25:33,007 --> 00:25:34,702

347
00:25:57,565 --> 00:25:58,122
What happened?

348
00:25:58,266 --> 00:26:00,666
Stink wants to frame me up?

349
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,135
We should fight individually.

350
00:26:21,389 --> 00:26:23,914
Big brother,
Explosion's racer wanted to frame Ann up

351
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:06,290

00:27:06,434 --> 00:27:08,595
You like him. Of course you say so

353
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,232

00:27:27,055 --> 00:27:29,853
Big Brother, Stink crashed the car

00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,692
You better do the right thing

360
00:27:43,671 --> 00:27:47,198
Stink's car is very good.

361
00:27:47,742 --> 00:27:48,504
He sent him home

362
00:27:48,643 --> 00:27:51,203
You better shut up. Otherwise,
l am qualified to look down on you.

363
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:54,073
Remember, to see what he got

00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:08,661
Have you finished playing?
The more you say, the more mistakes you make

365
00:28:08,796 --> 00:28:11,264
You owe me money.
What about diagnose charge of my brothers?

366
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:12,366
What diagnose charge?

367
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,730
What? You beat my brothers;
don't you reimburse money to them?

368
00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:16,598
OK, how much you want to get?

369
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:17,966
One price, fifty thousands

370
00:28:18,106 --> 00:28:19,232
What? Why don't you go to rob?

371
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,509
Hey, we are just discussing, let's talk

372
00:28:23,678 --> 00:28:25,976
Fifty thousands diagnose charge, l pay.

373
00:28:27,115 --> 00:28:29,106
l start calculating with you

374
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:30,850
You scared my brothers

375
00:28:30,985 --> 00:28:33,146
l ask for thirty thousands for medicine

376
00:28:33,655 --> 00:28:36,180
But you took action
when l was not in site. You were too slick

377
00:28:36,491 --> 00:28:38,982
l ask for fifty thousands.
You crashed my shop

378
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,122
l ask for two hundred thousand.
Reduce the fifty thousands

379
00:28:42,463 --> 00:28:43,930
You still owe me two hundred
thousands dollars. When will you pay?

380
00:28:44,065 --> 00:28:45,896
Bastard, you are fooling me

381
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:47,029
Can't l fool you?

382
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:49,395
Stink, you don't have to be angry

383
00:28:49,537 --> 00:28:50,936
You use to act irately

384
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,562
How can you be a boss?

385
00:28:53,508 --> 00:28:55,669
No wonder your followers are so bad

386
00:28:57,378 --> 00:28:58,709
Big brother, the car is on fire

387
00:29:00,682 --> 00:29:02,445
Put out the fire

388
00:29:03,685 --> 00:29:04,845
lt explores

389
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,888
Fuck it. To burn my car!

390
00:29:14,028 --> 00:29:18,089
Are you blind?
l was discussing with you

391
00:29:18,232 --> 00:29:20,393
Don't be blat! l can stand it.

392
00:29:20,535 --> 00:29:21,433
What did you say?

393
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:24,333
l know you got lots of enemies.

394
00:29:24,572 --> 00:29:25,504
You are genius

395
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,232
Put out the fire

396
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:29,343
You always talk nonsense

397
00:29:29,577 --> 00:29:31,067
We better talk about it

398
00:29:31,412 --> 00:29:34,711
Let's talk. l am afraid that you don't talk.

399
00:29:37,285 --> 00:29:38,217
Let's go

400
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:51,522
Police is coming

401
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:59,606
Don't go. Stay where you are

402
00:30:00,808 --> 00:30:01,968
What are you doing here?

403
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,743
Nothing

404
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:05,406
We were drinking in the shop

405
00:30:05,546 --> 00:30:07,411
We came out when
we saw the car was on fire

406
00:30:07,548 --> 00:30:09,175
The car was on fire? Whose car it is?

407
00:30:09,751 --> 00:30:12,686
Sir? That guy is in a fury.

408
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,980
l don't know whether it's his car.

409
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:14,821
Which one?

410
00:30:14,956 --> 00:30:16,583
The one who dressed in black?

411
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,422
The one who dressed in black?

412
00:30:18,993 --> 00:30:20,483
ls that your car?

413
00:30:20,962 --> 00:30:22,486
No, l don't know what has happened

414
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,528
l come out to take a look

415
00:30:23,664 --> 00:30:25,188
Do you know whose car it is?

416
00:30:26,134 --> 00:30:29,365
He stole that car. He will be in trouble

417
00:30:30,671 --> 00:30:32,969
You have guts.
Aren't you afraid my brother?

418
00:30:33,107 --> 00:30:36,440
l show my thankful for mercy.
l would like to give myself to you

419
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:42,314
Let get off and take a look.

420
00:30:42,784 --> 00:30:44,046
ls this new?

421
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,879
What? Are you tired of it?

422
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:49,484
This is my first time

423
00:30:51,092 --> 00:30:52,719
lf l knew it before, l didn't have
to pretend innocent for such long time

424
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,792
l also don't like it

425
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:02,667
There is one thing you must like it

426
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:04,765
Let's take a look

427
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:15,015
Ladies and gentlemen,
l sing this song for a woman

428
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:19,680
She is importance to me

429
00:31:20,288 --> 00:31:27,387
The woman is my mother. What is the reason?

430
00:31:27,762 --> 00:31:29,286
Why do l sing this song for her?

431
00:31:30,064 --> 00:31:31,463
Because l would like to tell her

432
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:35,127
l met a beautiful girl

433
00:33:10,932 --> 00:33:12,729
You can ask me to do anything
by phone call

434
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:14,164
You don't have to come here
by yourself. Brother Bing.

435
00:33:14,302 --> 00:33:16,099
l would like to clarify
everything face to face.

436
00:33:16,504 --> 00:33:19,962
l heard that you had
some argument with Stink

437
00:33:20,942 --> 00:33:23,502
l tried to discuss with him.
However, Stink...

438
00:33:23,644 --> 00:33:25,111
l don't care who's right

439
00:33:25,413 --> 00:33:27,881
l spoke with his big brother

440
00:33:28,015 --> 00:33:30,347
You burnt his car. You owe him...

441
00:33:30,618 --> 00:33:31,277
l owe him?

442
00:33:31,419 --> 00:33:33,319
Listen to me.
l know you are a hot-tempered man.

443
00:33:33,654 --> 00:33:39,422
l will pay. Money is not important

444
00:33:40,027 --> 00:33:43,326
His followers got hurt.
He wanted you to hand out the bastard

445
00:33:43,898 --> 00:33:45,263
What about he beat our guys?

446
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:47,660
You talk to me like that?

447
00:33:50,037 --> 00:33:51,629
l beat his followers

448
00:33:51,772 --> 00:33:52,670
You can send me to him

449
00:33:52,807 --> 00:33:55,776
No. To give money is not a proper way

450
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,105
You still want me to hand out my guys?
What a jerk he is?

451
00:33:58,412 --> 00:33:59,936
Are you a new guy?

452
00:34:00,448 --> 00:34:01,608
How can you define who's right?

453
00:34:01,882 --> 00:34:03,008
We should say
who's in a better situation.

454
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:06,176
You got shop and reputation

455
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,685
You will meet general public

456
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:10,352
Getting money is
better than anything else . Stupid

457
00:34:10,491 --> 00:34:12,425
lt's no way
if you ask me to hand out my guys.

458
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:14,254
l got a message.

459
00:34:14,528 --> 00:34:16,621
There is guy who named Joe

460
00:34:17,465 --> 00:34:19,092
That one?

461
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:21,267
Stink won't accept him even
if l hand him out

462
00:34:21,402 --> 00:34:23,393
We have compromised everything.
He just wants to have face

463
00:34:23,537 --> 00:34:24,970
Moreover, he beat the guy.

464
00:34:25,273 --> 00:34:26,035
He saved my sister once.

465
00:34:26,173 --> 00:34:29,370
Why so trouble?
To hand out our guy is not the right way.

466
00:34:30,378 --> 00:34:33,279
Now, they accept anyone. Let's do it.

467
00:34:33,848 --> 00:34:35,315
Don't say it anymore. Let's do it

468
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:52,963
l hope Bull will win credit in the future.
He can't rely to others when he makes mistake

469
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,226
He can't win credit

470
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:56,568
What can you expect him?

471
00:34:57,738 --> 00:34:59,763
Bull follows me since
he was twenty years old.

472
00:35:00,107 --> 00:35:01,904
He will ruin himself
if l don't take care of him

473
00:35:08,749 --> 00:35:12,947
Don't touch me. l am not in mood

474
00:35:13,087 --> 00:35:16,147
When the time we met each other,
you never said in mood.

475
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:20,885
What's happened?

476
00:35:22,263 --> 00:35:23,855
You never satisfy

477
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:27,060
Now l am not satisfied

478
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:24,158
Don't touch me

479
00:36:24,425 --> 00:36:26,985
You go to Stink's car park right now

480
00:36:27,128 --> 00:36:27,753
Do you know the location?

481
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:28,827
l know. Brother Bing

482
00:36:28,963 --> 00:36:30,089
OK

483
00:36:42,376 --> 00:36:43,274
Brother

484
00:36:44,478 --> 00:36:44,944
Yes?

485
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:46,512
Was Joe beaten?

486
00:36:47,114 --> 00:36:48,945
He is just a garage guy,
why are you so nervous?

487
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,210
Garage guy? He saved me once

488
00:36:51,352 --> 00:36:52,785
ls it true of what he said?

489
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,514
Shut up

490
00:36:56,457 --> 00:36:58,152
Did Bull tell you anything?

491
00:36:58,659 --> 00:37:00,752
Brother, he never touched me

492
00:37:00,895 --> 00:37:03,830
l know. l would kill him if he did.

493
00:37:04,565 --> 00:37:05,623
Why are you doing this?

494
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:08,364
Am l your brother?

495
00:37:08,669 --> 00:37:10,398
l am asking you the reason

496
00:37:10,704 --> 00:37:14,401
What reason?
Don't ask me if you treat me as your brother

497
00:37:14,842 --> 00:37:17,276
lt is no use for being softly.

498
00:37:17,411 --> 00:37:18,969
You have to treat me good

499
00:37:19,113 --> 00:37:21,240
l asked you to shut up

500
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:25,149
lt is my business. You leave me alone

501
00:37:27,388 --> 00:37:28,514
Where are you going?

502
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:31,386
l go and have a look

503
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:33,090
l go with you

504
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:47,964
Ann, Ann

505
00:37:51,879 --> 00:37:53,744
lt is closed. You come tomorrow

506
00:38:01,755 --> 00:38:03,017
Damn

507
00:38:12,299 --> 00:38:13,061
Hey

508
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:20,166
Go to hell

509
00:38:35,422 --> 00:38:36,184
Big Brother, lt is for you

510
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:37,252
Big brother

511
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:41,487
Ann, they are coming. You go with them

512
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,435
Joe

513
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:08,387
This is the one

514
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:46,518
lt is Bull's car

515
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:07,205
Joe

516
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:09,082
Joe

517
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,978
Joe

518
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:18,014
Don't touch me. Get lost

519
00:40:20,094 --> 00:40:21,118
Put him against the wall

520
00:40:21,562 --> 00:40:22,551
Oh

521
00:40:54,128 --> 00:40:55,561
We can't help

522
00:40:58,599 --> 00:40:59,395
You can go now

523
00:40:59,533 --> 00:41:02,001
Ann, you know it very well

524
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:53,909
Sorry, l didn't know you are bathing

525
00:42:54,181 --> 00:42:57,207
Don't be sorry. You have no guts

526
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:12,288
Thank you for sending me home
and clean up everything

527
00:43:14,101 --> 00:43:17,002
l did it because l got bored.
l don't need you say thank you

528
00:43:17,671 --> 00:43:19,104
lt is no use to say it

529
00:43:20,374 --> 00:43:22,171
We both know
what kind of person l am

530
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:24,607
What kind of person? You tell me

531
00:43:25,279 --> 00:43:26,644
Can't you say?

532
00:43:28,482 --> 00:43:32,111
You have no guts.
You are afraid of my brother, right?

533
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:21,064
Ann, stop the car

534
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:50,488
Ann, get dressed. Let's go

535
00:45:50,624 --> 00:45:54,890
Otherwise, it's too late.
You didn't go home last night

536
00:45:55,629 --> 00:45:58,496
Your brother is looking for you.
He will come here very soon.

537
00:45:58,632 --> 00:46:01,533
l can't imagine if he see you like this

538
00:46:05,939 --> 00:46:07,065
He will know sooner or later

539
00:46:07,641 --> 00:46:09,871
Not under this circumstance.

540
00:46:13,413 --> 00:46:15,608
You better go. Thank you for telling me

541
00:46:16,583 --> 00:46:18,175
You know what to do

542
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:43,036
l asked you if you knew
Ann's whereabouts. You said you didn't know

543
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:44,200
Don't bother them

544
00:46:44,711 --> 00:46:50,013
l don't need your lecture. Get lost

545
00:46:50,584 --> 00:46:53,712
We will be finished if you hit me

546
00:46:53,854 --> 00:46:55,845
Sister-in law, our brothers are here

547
00:46:55,989 --> 00:46:58,389
How can you say something
on behalf of outsider?

548
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:00,322
Shut up

549
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,686
OK, you are sister-in-law;
l am a small potato. l shut up

550
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:05,798
Enough

551
00:47:06,666 --> 00:47:07,724
Enough. l won't let you blame my guys.

552
00:47:07,868 --> 00:47:09,995
You beat him.
What else you want to do?

553
00:47:10,137 --> 00:47:11,536
There are two different things.

554
00:47:11,671 --> 00:47:13,730
lt's no way he can touch my sister

555
00:47:14,007 --> 00:47:16,805
Your sister is voluntary.

556
00:47:16,943 --> 00:47:19,377
Bastard,
you said my sister voluntary to undress.

557
00:47:19,913 --> 00:47:23,440
l will come back to you for this

558
00:47:35,195 --> 00:47:36,560
Bastard

559
00:47:38,098 --> 00:47:41,829
No. What are you doing?

560
00:47:42,302 --> 00:47:45,738
Police. Stop. Step aside

561
00:47:46,206 --> 00:47:48,606
Bastard. Stop fighting

562
00:47:49,209 --> 00:47:50,141
Don't stop me

563
00:47:50,377 --> 00:47:51,469
What are you doing?

564
00:47:51,912 --> 00:47:54,403
Get out of the way

565
00:47:54,548 --> 00:47:55,378
Don't do anything stupid

566
00:47:55,515 --> 00:47:57,415
Damn you.
Don't touch my sister anymore

567
00:47:57,551 --> 00:47:59,041
l tell you

568
00:47:59,653 --> 00:48:01,484
Bastard. What are you doing?
Don't fight

569
00:48:01,621 --> 00:48:03,020
Your daughter was fucked, bastard

570
00:48:03,156 --> 00:48:04,282
lt is not right to beat him

571
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:07,188
Not right. Everything l do is not right

572
00:48:07,327 --> 00:48:09,227
My sister was fucked.

573
00:48:09,496 --> 00:48:12,465
Let's not talk about your sister.
l got a message

574
00:48:12,732 --> 00:48:13,892
You crashed his car

575
00:48:14,034 --> 00:48:15,626
and sent him for beaten.

576
00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:17,600
You are diffident

577
00:48:18,105 --> 00:48:19,936
You can say whatever you like

578
00:48:20,373 --> 00:48:22,466
You can falsely accuse me.
Police has powers

579
00:48:22,843 --> 00:48:24,777
As a matter of fact,
you destroyed our garage

580
00:48:25,879 --> 00:48:27,346
Police are here. Let them do their jobs

581
00:48:27,481 --> 00:48:28,243
Can't you hear?

582
00:48:28,381 --> 00:48:30,713
He's his dad. No wonder he is so fierce

583
00:48:30,984 --> 00:48:32,212
What are you talking about?

584
00:48:33,453 --> 00:48:35,853
Don't move.
l'll fight with you if you move

585
00:48:37,157 --> 00:48:40,615
l tell you. l feel pity for you this time

586
00:48:40,927 --> 00:48:42,053
You can accuse him.

587
00:48:42,362 --> 00:48:45,024
l will act with justice

588
00:48:45,165 --> 00:48:47,497
Joe, accuse him. Don't be afraid

589
00:48:55,976 --> 00:48:57,375
l don't want to

590
00:48:57,711 --> 00:48:58,905
What? Joe?

591
00:48:59,379 --> 00:49:01,210
He said he didn't want to.
Can't you hear, bastard?

592
00:49:01,348 --> 00:49:01,814
You beat him and you are fierce to him?

593
00:49:01,948 --> 00:49:02,380
Shut up

594
00:49:02,516 --> 00:49:04,245
Don't do anything silly.

595
00:49:04,484 --> 00:49:05,508
Let's go

596
00:49:06,186 --> 00:49:09,883
Go. You want to be arrested 48 hours?

597
00:49:12,425 --> 00:49:16,919
Ann, let's go.

598
00:49:22,369 --> 00:49:23,495
Why are you afraid of him?

599
00:49:23,637 --> 00:49:24,968
There are police, accuse him

600
00:49:25,105 --> 00:49:26,299
Stop it.

601
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,575
Fellow, l don't care what are you doing?

602
00:49:30,243 --> 00:49:31,437
You don't touch my daughter

603
00:49:31,578 --> 00:49:32,670
Police threaten me

604
00:49:34,481 --> 00:49:38,212
You can change your mind.
You have right to accuse him

605
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:42,252
Ann, where are you going?

606
00:49:42,389 --> 00:49:43,356
l won't go there anymore.

607
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:45,185
l am afraid that you will break his arm

608
00:49:45,325 --> 00:49:46,155
You don't trust your brother

609
00:49:46,293 --> 00:49:47,089
l dare not

610
00:49:47,227 --> 00:49:48,353
He is not a good guy

611
00:49:48,495 --> 00:49:50,827
l know what kind of person he is

612
00:49:51,164 --> 00:49:54,759
Ann,
You like to voluntary to give yourself.

613
00:49:54,901 --> 00:49:55,959
Go. Go.

614
00:49:57,904 --> 00:49:59,269
He is playing game with you.

615
00:49:59,406 --> 00:50:02,671
He and l have some conflict.
You don't know he is playing game.

616
00:50:02,809 --> 00:50:04,140
You are playing game with me.

617
00:50:04,277 --> 00:50:06,711
l dare not to see him anymore.
Are you happy now?

618
00:50:09,249 --> 00:50:11,012
l care about you

619
00:50:11,151 --> 00:50:12,083
Thank you so much

620
00:50:12,219 --> 00:50:13,186
Are you angry with me

621
00:50:13,753 --> 00:50:15,482
because of that fellow?

622
00:50:15,622 --> 00:50:18,716
l am not angry with you.
l just can't stand it. Dad is right

623
00:50:18,858 --> 00:50:19,950
Don't mention about that bastard

624
00:50:23,263 --> 00:50:23,991
Go

625
00:50:24,264 --> 00:50:25,390
l don't go

626
00:50:25,632 --> 00:50:26,724
Don't play an act in front of him

627
00:50:26,866 --> 00:50:27,855
What did you say?

628
00:50:28,001 --> 00:50:28,865
What?

629
00:50:29,002 --> 00:50:29,798
Bastard

630
00:50:29,936 --> 00:50:31,369
Don't fight

631
00:50:32,772 --> 00:50:34,637
Ann! Bastard!

632
00:50:38,445 --> 00:50:40,208
Go! l know that you don't want me

633
00:50:40,347 --> 00:50:43,077
l have told you that it is very troubled
if we race illegally

634
00:50:43,216 --> 00:50:44,683
Old Guy, it is none of my business.

635
00:50:44,985 --> 00:50:46,009
He got the trouble himself

636
00:50:46,353 --> 00:50:48,548
l came here this morning
and saw the garage had been destroyed

637
00:50:48,688 --> 00:50:50,178
l worried about him.

638
00:50:50,957 --> 00:50:52,481
l didn't expect that
he be in bed with his girlfriend

639
00:50:53,126 --> 00:50:55,321
He was cheated and knew nothing

640
00:50:55,929 --> 00:50:57,794
l don't see
why he came with so many policemen

641
00:50:59,299 --> 00:51:00,891
We have to do business

642
00:51:01,534 --> 00:51:04,332
l would say you are afraid.
l will get to the root of the matter.

643
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:14,740
You always stick to him.
Now you have got a lesson.

644
00:51:15,081 --> 00:51:20,849
That bastard won't die a nature death

645
00:51:21,554 --> 00:51:22,816
l would throw him out of window

646
00:51:23,123 --> 00:51:25,648
when he was little if l knew he did that

647
00:51:25,959 --> 00:51:29,656
Won't you stop blaming?
You always blame him

648
00:51:30,196 --> 00:51:31,993
Brother turned bad is because of you.

649
00:51:32,132 --> 00:51:33,929
Stop the car. l want to get off

650
00:51:35,635 --> 00:51:38,069
Ann, where are you going?

651
00:51:38,305 --> 00:51:49,477
Ann! Bastard!

652
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,727
What game you are playing?
You took away everything

653
00:52:03,863 --> 00:52:05,023
You never return my call

654
00:52:05,165 --> 00:52:07,292
l am not playing game.
We are finished

655
00:52:07,634 --> 00:52:08,566
What did you say?

656
00:52:09,035 --> 00:52:10,127
You never treated me as your girlfriend.

657
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:11,532
Why do you come here?

658
00:52:12,105 --> 00:52:14,335
l didn't treat you as my girlfriend?

659
00:52:14,741 --> 00:52:16,072
You can die for your guys

660
00:52:16,209 --> 00:52:17,540
You can go to hell for your sister.

661
00:52:17,677 --> 00:52:19,304
Did you do anything for me?

662
00:52:20,113 --> 00:52:22,946
l bumped the police. Can you deny it?
l didn't do anything for you?

663
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:25,108
Bump the police? lt is because you hate police

664
00:52:25,251 --> 00:52:27,242
You never do what ever l ask you to do

665
00:52:27,387 --> 00:52:28,581
You never respect me.

666
00:52:28,722 --> 00:52:30,451
You don't care about me

667
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:32,280
Why should l go with you?

668
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,959
You lift up my dress
when you are happy

669
00:52:35,228 --> 00:52:37,128
When you are unhappy, you will
kick me away even l take off my panty

670
00:52:37,263 --> 00:52:42,326
l am also a human being.
You think about it

671
00:52:43,103 --> 00:52:44,092
Katy

672
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,712
Hurry up

673
00:52:54,848 --> 00:52:55,576
What?

674
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:58,183
Syrup is arguing
with Explosion and Lui

675
00:52:58,318 --> 00:52:59,683
Why don't they wait for me?

676
00:53:06,292 --> 00:53:08,522
You want to play game?

677
00:53:10,296 --> 00:53:13,390
Here comes the big boss.
l thought that he dared not to come

678
00:53:13,533 --> 00:53:14,363
What are you boosting?

679
00:53:14,501 --> 00:53:15,593
Shut up

680
00:53:15,935 --> 00:53:17,960
Don't talk nonsense. Sit

681
00:53:20,273 --> 00:53:21,535
Sit down

682
00:53:26,513 --> 00:53:30,244
Lui, they are so fierce.
How can we talk?

683
00:53:36,122 --> 00:53:37,453
ls it possible to talk?

684
00:53:39,058 --> 00:53:40,719
l am listening

685
00:53:42,362 --> 00:53:45,354
Lui, no matter who's right

686
00:53:45,498 --> 00:53:49,525
l don't want to argue with you.
The issue started with a racing

687
00:53:49,869 --> 00:53:53,896
lt is very simple.
We race one more time

688
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,634
Joe, are you nut?

689
00:53:57,610 --> 00:54:02,172
OK, l give you one more chance

690
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:06,011
You get lost
and not to touch my sister anymore

691
00:54:06,152 --> 00:54:07,619
Otherwise, l will kill you

692
00:54:08,087 --> 00:54:09,611
l don't care about you.

693
00:54:09,989 --> 00:54:12,014
We can only thousands dollars
even if we win

694
00:54:12,592 --> 00:54:14,526
What's about my garage?
How much you should pay me back?

695
00:54:15,195 --> 00:54:17,925
You dislike the small amount?
Let's do a bigger bet

696
00:54:18,531 --> 00:54:20,761
Three hundred thousand dollars.
You better give up if you have no guts.

697
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:21,559
What?

698
00:54:21,701 --> 00:54:22,633
Syrup

699
00:54:22,769 --> 00:54:24,396
Don't stop me if we are friends

700
00:54:26,005 --> 00:54:29,099
Three hundred thousand? lt's not enough.
Let's bet five hundred thousand

701
00:54:29,242 --> 00:54:30,140
Syrup

702
00:54:30,276 --> 00:54:31,607
Do you threaten me?

703
00:54:32,178 --> 00:54:33,475
Yes. What you think?

704
00:54:36,082 --> 00:54:37,447
OK, let's bet five hundred thousand

705
00:54:38,551 --> 00:54:40,212
Everybody is watching me.

706
00:54:40,353 --> 00:54:41,377
We are not friends if you stop me

707
00:54:41,521 --> 00:54:45,457
What are you doing? Get out

708
00:54:45,592 --> 00:54:46,854
Go

709
00:54:55,301 --> 00:54:56,495
Get out

710
00:54:58,771 --> 00:55:01,638
You are so impressive.
You negotiate with so many people

711
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:03,197
To negotiate in restaurant is not
in fashion anymore

712
00:55:03,343 --> 00:55:06,403
Bastard, you are outdated

713
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:08,704
You better watch your mouth

714
00:55:09,082 --> 00:55:10,447
lf your sister didn't call me

715
00:55:10,583 --> 00:55:12,915
l wouldn't come here

716
00:55:15,955 --> 00:55:17,354
in the middle of night.

717
00:55:17,891 --> 00:55:18,721
Girlfriend doesn't want you.

718
00:55:19,225 --> 00:55:23,389
Sister is angry with you.
You better quit

719
00:55:23,863 --> 00:55:25,023
What are you talking about? Sir

720
00:55:25,164 --> 00:55:28,361
Don't pretend innocent.
My supervisor has your file

721
00:55:28,501 --> 00:55:31,937
Don't think that it doesn't matter.
You are used and you

722
00:55:33,273 --> 00:55:37,767
might be charged implication

723
00:55:39,612 --> 00:55:46,609
lt's none of your business.
Can l go now?

724
00:55:47,086 --> 00:55:51,523
Don't complain that l am not helping.
l hope you can be out of trouble

725
00:55:55,762 --> 00:55:58,026
Big brother, what happened?

726
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,133
When you negotiate with somebody,
you should discuss with me first

727
00:56:10,009 --> 00:56:11,442
l can't suffer

728
00:56:12,278 --> 00:56:15,270
Can't suffer!
You have to get a result like this?

729
00:56:15,415 --> 00:56:17,610
l patch up a quarrel.

730
00:56:18,117 --> 00:56:19,482
But you act like a big hero

731
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:21,777
To bet five hundred thousand.
You think that you are play monopoly?

732
00:56:22,155 --> 00:56:24,521
You have to pay him everything
if you lose

733
00:56:25,124 --> 00:56:25,920
Must we lose?

734
00:56:26,059 --> 00:56:26,855
Must we win?

735
00:56:26,993 --> 00:56:28,187
l pay everything if we lose.

736
00:56:28,328 --> 00:56:30,057
l can't let him take advantage

737
00:56:30,196 --> 00:56:31,857
You like to...

738
00:56:31,998 --> 00:56:34,023
l like it. What?

739
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:38,560
Old Guy, don't talk with him. Let's go

740
00:56:40,473 --> 00:56:42,839
What happen now?

741
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:47,407
Hey, are we brothers?

742
00:56:47,547 --> 00:56:48,343
Bastard.

743
00:56:48,481 --> 00:56:50,381
We are brothers when nothing happens.
You kick me away when something gets wrong

744
00:56:50,516 --> 00:56:53,383
We have to park the car

745
00:56:55,421 --> 00:56:57,048
You are playing game with me

746
00:56:57,590 --> 00:56:59,114
This is my last time to tell you

747
00:56:59,425 --> 00:57:01,655
l won't be your brother
if you bring disaster again

748
00:57:09,268 --> 00:57:12,066
Fat Dog, the drugs are in that car.

749
00:57:12,205 --> 00:57:14,696
You go and take it. Be careful

750
00:57:14,841 --> 00:57:16,274

751
00:59:05,384 --> 00:59:06,715
Big brother, your dad

752
00:59:07,653 --> 00:59:09,780
Stop the car, bastard

753
00:59:27,807 --> 00:59:29,502
Big brother, don't get off.

754
00:59:29,876 --> 00:59:30,638
Get away

755
00:59:30,777 --> 00:59:32,574
Big Brother

756
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,613
Don't care about me.
You go home first. Don't wait for me

757
00:59:44,924 --> 00:59:48,587
Dad, dad, open the door.

758
00:59:49,362 --> 01:00:00,796
Dad, dad, are you alright?

759
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:02,237

760
01:00:04,076 --> 01:00:05,168
Are you alright?

761
01:00:05,945 --> 01:00:07,708
When will you be a good guy?

762
01:00:08,014 --> 01:00:11,415
l want to correct you

763
01:00:11,684 --> 01:00:17,350
You will be finished

l can half open my eyes

765
01:00:19,692 --> 01:00:23,594
if your file is in my hand.
Do you understand?

766
01:00:23,896 --> 01:00:36,104
Dad, dad.

767
01:00:39,445 --> 01:00:45,680
Mr. Lui Yiu Wing rests
in Holy Father's arm

768
01:00:46,118 --> 01:00:47,346
Time's up

769
01:00:49,255 --> 01:00:58,391
He will come. They used to blame.

770
01:00:58,931 --> 01:01:01,263
ln fact, they cared about each other

771
01:01:02,501 --> 01:01:05,299
Holy Father, Holy Son and Holy Spirit,

772
01:01:11,711 --> 01:01:13,178
Can we wait a moment?

773
01:01:14,847 --> 01:01:15,814
Sorry

774
01:01:32,665 --> 01:01:39,070
Brother Bing. l want to quit

01:01:39,205 --> 01:01:42,038
Don't be childhood.
l know you r dad is dead

776
01:01:42,174 --> 01:01:45,234
You feel guilty. But what will you do

777
01:01:45,378 --> 01:01:46,936
if you don't work for me?

778
01:01:47,246 --> 01:01:48,178
l will work in the garage

779
01:01:48,314 --> 01:01:50,748
Aren't you satisfying
the present situation?

780
01:01:51,117 --> 01:01:52,311
Your racing skill is perfect.

781
01:01:52,451 --> 01:01:55,545
You have your followers.
We know how you live

782
01:01:55,688 --> 01:01:58,680
if you don't work for me anymore.

783
01:01:58,991 --> 01:02:00,219
Brother Bing

784
01:02:01,661 --> 01:02:02,650
What?

785
01:02:02,795 --> 01:02:04,194
Didn't you say you
would drink with me?

786
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:05,456
l am drinking with you

787
01:02:05,598 --> 01:02:07,190
What happened? Lui?

788
01:02:09,468 --> 01:02:10,958
You better think about it

789
01:02:11,671 --> 01:02:13,366
OK, let's play

790
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:14,800
Five

791
01:02:15,107 --> 01:02:17,439

l am a good-hearted person.

799
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,337
You better talk frankly

800
01:03:32,952 --> 01:03:34,943
Your dad...

801
01:03:35,888 --> 01:03:37,583
Thank you for asking

802
01:03:38,324 --> 01:03:41,316
l called you. l know you moved out
from your brother's place

803
01:03:42,428 --> 01:03:44,896
You are so clever.
No wonder you called Katy

804
01:03:46,265 --> 01:03:47,732
How long do you want to hide?

805
01:03:48,167 --> 01:03:49,759
l don't know what you are talking about

806
01:03:52,038 --> 01:03:53,665
You think that you have characteristic?

807
01:03:55,941 --> 01:03:59,206
We are mutual.
l don't care to sleep with you, why you should?

808
01:04:00,646 --> 01:04:01,442
Let's talk

809
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:02,547
Get off your hands

810
01:04:02,681 --> 01:04:04,649
l won't get off my hands
if you don't say it clearly

811
01:04:04,784 --> 01:04:06,308
You want to play an act in the public?

812
01:04:07,486 --> 01:04:09,681
Yes,
l would like to play an act in the public.

813
01:04:10,089 --> 01:04:15,391
So what? You said l had no guts at first

814
01:04:15,528 --> 01:04:18,463
Now l get guts and you want to quit.

815
01:04:18,597 --> 01:04:20,394
You want to play game with me?
l will go right now if you say yes

01:04:20,533 --> 01:04:22,398
Answer me. Why don't you answer me?

817
01:04:22,668 --> 01:04:24,533
l am afraid my brother will beat you
to death. Do you like this answer?

818
01:05:22,094 --> 01:05:22,617
Let me kiss

819
01:05:22,761 --> 01:05:23,750
Are you nut?

820
01:05:25,297 --> 01:05:27,060

l will race with your brother
and l don't care if l win

822
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:42,340
l will start my own life
and won't race anymore

823
01:05:53,192 --> 01:05:54,853
Big brother, will you play?

824
01:05:54,994 --> 01:05:55,926
Would you like to join us?

825
01:05:56,162 --> 01:05:57,026
No, you play

826
01:05:57,530 --> 01:05:58,326
Hurry up

827
01:05:58,464 --> 01:06:00,193
OK, don't push me

828
01:06:01,433 --> 01:06:04,300
Ann, you are here.
You should come back long time ago.

829
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:05,867
Your brother is missing you

830
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:14,341
Ann, what happened?

831
01:06:14,713 --> 01:06:16,943
Dad's bone ash will be ready
two days later. You better come earlier.

832
01:06:17,082 --> 01:06:19,812
What's wrong with you? He wanted to
arrest Big Brother when he was alive

833
01:06:20,085 --> 01:06:20,676
Why do you treat him so well?

834
01:06:20,819 --> 01:06:22,878
Yes. He also wanted to arrest me

835
01:06:23,022 --> 01:06:24,148
He was my dad

836
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:25,416
That's what he asked for

837
01:06:25,558 --> 01:06:27,492
Will you stop? You...

838
01:06:30,729 --> 01:06:34,392
Ann, Dad...

839
01:06:34,533 --> 01:06:35,591
l didn't know what he said was true

840
01:06:35,734 --> 01:06:37,964
if he was not dead

841
01:06:40,573 --> 01:06:42,438
He wouldn't blame you anymore.

842
01:06:43,342 --> 01:06:45,469
You can do anything with your guys

843
01:06:47,846 --> 01:06:49,438
Katy will go to Canada two days later.

844
01:06:49,582 --> 01:06:52,380
She might not come back.
You better go to see her

845
01:07:00,926 --> 01:07:03,554
Good stuff

846
01:07:04,496 --> 01:07:06,225
The car is good. What's about the driver?

847
01:07:06,365 --> 01:07:07,889
Good? l say it's ugly

848
01:07:14,473 --> 01:07:15,531
He's driving the car

849
01:07:15,975 --> 01:07:16,703
Let's chase him

850
01:07:16,842 --> 01:07:18,707
OK

851
01:07:35,227 --> 01:07:37,695
l count you win if you reach my taillight

852
01:07:47,206 --> 01:07:48,639
Let race

853
01:08:51,904 --> 01:08:53,804
What's wrong with you?
Do you know how to drive?

854
01:08:54,139 --> 01:08:54,901
Do you admit defeat?

855
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,166
lt's just a game

856
01:08:56,308 --> 01:08:58,003
You've gone too far.
You don't have to do that

857
01:08:58,210 --> 01:08:59,802
You should admit defeat
when playing a game.

858
01:09:01,814 --> 01:09:03,338
Otherwise, you better go home

859
01:09:08,754 --> 01:09:12,019
Where do you take me?
Get off your hands

860
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,855
Brother Bing, here he comes

861
01:09:17,196 --> 01:09:17,855
Lui

862
01:09:17,996 --> 01:09:19,088
Brother Bing

863
01:09:20,165 --> 01:09:21,097
Please sit

864
01:09:23,302 --> 01:09:24,326
Sit

865
01:09:30,275 --> 01:09:32,505
What? You got something to talk to me?

866
01:09:34,546 --> 01:09:38,482
Brother Bing, l want to quit

867
01:09:39,818 --> 01:09:45,654

What are you thinking?

873
01:10:43,415 --> 01:10:44,404
Are you thinking about Ann?

874
01:10:46,685 --> 01:10:48,585
What happened with her
and the garage boy?

875
01:10:52,991 --> 01:11:05,802
You have to race tomorrow night.
You said you couldn't lose it

876
01:11:06,738 --> 01:11:08,035
l must go

877
01:11:11,076 --> 01:11:15,706
What's that if you win?
You think you can get credit?

878

l raced

879
01:11:22,754 --> 01:11:24,779

But now, l just want to tell everybody

882
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:36,790

883
01:11:36,935 --> 01:11:39,904
and go away.

884
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:42,370

887
01:11:48,614 --> 01:11:56,885
Regret to implicate my dad

888
01:11:57,422 --> 01:12:07,263
l would like to make clear everything
even l start my own life

889
01:12:10,269 --> 01:12:11,634

890
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:13,863
no matter it's right or wrong

891
01:12:26,685 --> 01:12:28,676

You also can stay in my garage

903
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:05,281
Or you can work for Brother Bing.
You should make up your mind

904
01:13:06,825 --> 01:13:08,554
Big Brother

905
01:13:10,095 --> 01:13:12,359

You told me it would be OK.
You said you would start a new life

01:20:03,041 --> 01:20:05,202
You can't do that.

01:20:07,512 --> 01:20:09,742
Why did you race with him?

She said that Bull had known you
would escape with Ann

1034
01:25:16,688 --> 01:25:19,748
Ann was shamed to see you

because Bull had raped her

1036
01:25:24,762 --> 01:25:26,593

They beat me like that.
l have no chance to explain everything

1043
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:50,812
l would rather let Bull kill him

1044
01:25:56,361 --> 01:25:58,727
You don't care about your brother's death.
And would rather stand up for that bastard?

1045
01:25:58,863 --> 01:26:00,023
Bull, put down the gun

1046
01:26:00,164 --> 01:26:00,721
Go away

1047
01:26:00,865 --> 01:26:02,298

01:27:03,528 --> 01:27:06,520
Somebody fired a gun. Help!

1067
01:27:18,643 --> 01:27:19,507
What happened?

1068
01:27:46,504 --> 01:27:48,131
How dared you rape her?

1069
01:27:50,608 --> 01:27:53,975
Joe, don't. Joe,

You trust me.

1074

Don't fight!

1075
01:28:13,164 --> 01:28:20,400
Bull.

1076
01:28:39,624 --> 01:28:46,029
Big Brother, l revenge for you

1077
01:28:49,133 --> 01:28:50,532
Joe

1078
01:28:52,904 --> 01:28:53,962
Big Brother

1079
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:04,213

How could he bump my brother?
The one who bumped brother was you

1088
01:29:48,693 --> 01:29:49,853
You can blame me

1089
01:29:53,631 --> 01:29:55,098
lt's none of your business.

1090
01:29:56,133 --> 01:29:57,395
Bull started the trouble.

1091
01:29:58,336 --> 01:30:02,432
You were afraid to lose five hundred! K
thousand, and then you started the trouble

1092
