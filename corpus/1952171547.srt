1
00:00:59,978 --> 00:01:01,251
Help.

2
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,839
Somebody.

3
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:05,824
Oh, my God.

4
00:01:05,825 --> 00:01:07,330
There's gas leaking out of the plane.

5
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:08,696
It's going to blow.

6
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:19,183
- Anybody aboard?
- One more, Lieutenant, up front.

7
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,909
I think I got a broken leg.

8
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,378
I'm with the city,
and I'm getting you out of here.

9
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:38,669
Here we go.

15
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:13,512
I don't know what happened.

16
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:15,299
Takeoff was clean.

17
00:03:16,354 --> 00:03:17,732
Suddenly, there was a flash.

18
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:20,616
You say flash.
You mean explosion, right?

19
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:23,123
No, no, just a flash, um...

20
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:25,332
everything went green.

21
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:27,739
"Everything went green"?

22
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:29,790
Check his eyes, please.

23
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:40,099
He has damage.

24
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,886
Corneal scarring.

25
00:03:42,345 --> 00:03:43,635
What could've caused that?

26
00:03:43,636 --> 00:03:45,100
I don't know, maybe a laser.

27
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:47,060
Wait. You mean someone
from the ground? We were...

28
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,426
we were a quarter-mile up.

29
00:03:48,722 --> 00:03:51,949
See, a five-milliwatt laser could
reach two miles in the air, though.

30
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:01,550
Excuse me.

31
00:04:03,808 --> 00:04:05,124
Yeah, Eric. Um...

32
00:04:05,632 --> 00:04:08,300
Call the control tower.
I want a copy of the nav-aids.

33
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:10,398
I want to find out
who brought this plane down.

34
00:04:30,338 --> 00:04:31,604
Hey, stranger.

35
00:04:32,257 --> 00:04:33,560
John.

36
00:04:33,994 --> 00:04:35,347
Oh my goodness.

37
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,779
- How've you been?
- Great.

38
00:04:37,953 --> 00:04:39,256
You're looking good.

39
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:42,470
Thanks. I'm sorry.

40
00:04:42,953 --> 00:04:44,962
I'm just surprised.
I haven't seen you in a while.

41
00:04:44,963 --> 00:04:46,639
Actually, this is my first week back.

42
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:50,126
I'm acting as department liaison
for the NTSB boys on the crash.

43
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:52,322
Oh, really? So we're
gonna be working together.

44
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:53,724
Looks like it.

45
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,686
I tried calling you a couple of times.

46
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,165
It's just, it's been really crazy at the lab.

47
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,865
Too crazy to pick up the phone, huh?

48
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,123
Hey, what's up?

49
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:09,084
Ryan Wolfe. Detective John Hagen.

50
00:05:09,444 --> 00:05:10,809
Oh, Hagen. You're, uh...

51
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:12,199
you're Ray Caine's old partner.

52
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:14,854
Yeah.

53
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:16,281
That was me.

54
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:18,092
I'll see you around, Calleigh.

55
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:19,209
Okay.

56
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,416
What was that about?

57
00:05:24,204 --> 00:05:25,520
It's complicated.

58
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:29,168
- He's been on IOD.
- Injured on duty?

59
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:30,981
What was the problem?

60
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:32,704
I don't know.
Something about a bad back.

61
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,422
Yeah, I heard that one before.

62
00:05:35,797 --> 00:05:37,137
What's that supposed to mean?

63
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:39,013
Nothing.

64
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:40,339
You can tell me.

65
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,869
Couple guys I knew in patrol,

66
00:05:43,904 --> 00:05:46,646
"bad back" meant they couldn't get cleared by the department shrink.

67
00:06:20,743 --> 00:06:22,095
Excuse me.

68
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,475
In the hat, excuse me.

69
00:06:26,505 --> 00:06:27,994
Step away from the bags, please.

70
00:06:28,006 --> 00:06:29,545
It's all right. These belong to me.

71
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,427
The bags are evidence in a plane crash, sir.

72
00:06:32,431 --> 00:06:35,034
- Please step away...
- Yeah, I know. I own the plane.

73
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:36,561
Sean Walsh,

74
00:06:36,573 --> 00:06:39,509
Air-Away Freight Systems.
I'm just collecting my cargo.

75
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:42,458
Mr. Walsh, looting is a felony.

76
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,208
Step away from the bags.

77
00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:47,686
Look, if I don't get these checks

78
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:49,844
to Atlanta under deadline,

79
00:06:50,103 --> 00:06:51,793
a couple local banks are going under.

80
00:06:52,134 --> 00:06:53,639
How much was on the plane?

81
00:06:54,034 --> 00:06:55,084
$1.2 billion.

82
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:58,971
- Excuse me?
- 1.2 billion in checks

83
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,816
mortgages, car loans, company payrolls.

84
00:07:02,784 --> 00:07:04,437
Every day, every check that's written

85
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:06,152
has got to be physically moved to a bank.

86
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:07,877
Freight dogs move them.

87
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:10,911
- Freight dogs?
- Yep. That's what we call ourselves.

88
00:07:11,244 --> 00:07:12,872
Ain't exactly a glamour business.

89
00:07:12,874 --> 00:07:15,020
The bags stay here.

90
00:07:22,293 --> 00:07:23,847
All right, look. I know how this works.

91
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:26,987
- What's it gonna take?
- I suggest you leave now,

92
00:07:27,022 --> 00:07:29,609
or you will be placed
under arrest. It's up to you.

93
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:36,557
You're the man.

94
00:07:38,503 --> 00:07:40,069
The controller said the cargo jet

95
00:07:40,081 --> 00:07:42,696
was heading southeast on runway nine right.

96
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:44,311
Well, there it is right there.

97
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,884
The pilot says he was climbing.

98
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,519
Hold on. Freeze it right there.

99
00:07:57,008 --> 00:07:58,291
That's it.

100
00:07:58,624 --> 00:08:00,981
That's where he lost control.
The jet was banking left.

101
00:08:01,436 --> 00:08:03,890
Well, lasers travel in a straight line, so...

102
00:08:04,638 --> 00:08:07,179
I can extrapolate a probable line of sight

103
00:08:07,463 --> 00:08:09,793
from the cockpit window to the ground.

104
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:14,369
Gets us down to six blocks in the Gables.

105
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,714
Laser guy was standing in that perimeter.

106
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:19,353
Or living there.

107
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,682
It's about time you guys got here.

108
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,914
I've been keeping a log.

109
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:27,359
You're keeping a log?

110
00:08:27,394 --> 00:08:30,034
Now, they're supposed to be restricting
takeoffs over the neighborhood between

111
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:32,598
12:00 and 6:00 a. m. But
I've been hearing jet engines

112
00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:34,448
every night this week after midnight.

113
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,720
That's not why we're here.

114
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:38,594
Unbelievable.

115
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:41,924
What is it gonna take for you people
to start paying attention?

116
00:08:42,537 --> 00:08:45,768
Mr. Stamler, we are aware of the fact
that you've filed numerous complaints

117
00:08:45,803 --> 00:08:47,755
against Miami International Airport,

118
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,670
and that you're the leader
of a group called

119
00:08:49,705 --> 00:08:51,890
Citizens for Quiet Skies.

120
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,360
I'm a community activist.

121
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:54,831
Yes, and it's come to our attention,

122
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:57,295
Mr. Stamler, that you've
threatened to bring down a plane.

123
00:08:58,516 --> 00:09:01,106
Miami International recorded
a conversation last week.

124
00:09:01,655 --> 00:09:03,085
Like I told the police then,

125
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,370
it was just talk.

126
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:05,748
I wanted to be taken seriously.

127
00:09:05,783 --> 00:09:07,842
Well, a cargo jet crashed this morning.

128
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,544
Is that serious enough for you?

129
00:09:09,754 --> 00:09:11,061
Well, it's like I've been saying, that

130
00:09:11,123 --> 00:09:12,923
flight path is a threat to the whole neighborhood.

131
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:20,233
It appears that the threat...

132
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:23,646
has come a little closer to home.

133
00:09:27,469 --> 00:09:28,789
What do you mean?

134
00:09:31,622 --> 00:09:33,089
This is what I mean.

135
00:09:34,631 --> 00:09:36,838
This is a green-diode laser.

136
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:38,688
I bought it on-line. It's not illegal.

137
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:41,228
It is if you use it to bring down an airplane.

138
00:09:41,793 --> 00:09:44,335
- This is a joke, right?
- I can assure you this is no joke.

139
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,158
You used this to blind the pilots on that plane.

140
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,117
I was just trying to make a point.

141
00:09:57,265 --> 00:09:59,411
You did, and now you're under arrest.

142
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:02,319
All I ever wanted was to live
in a quiet neighborhood.

143
00:10:02,388 --> 00:10:03,721
Yes, well, Mr. Stamler,

144
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,225
you just got your wish.

145
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:24,720
I didn't think these planes carried cash.

146
00:10:24,782 --> 00:10:29,030
They don't. Legally, the only thing they're
allowed to transport are checks.

147
00:10:29,138 --> 00:10:31,138
I found a bunch of cash already.

148
00:10:31,288 --> 00:10:34,916
This whole operation's looking very shifty.
I'm gonna take this back to the lab.

149
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:36,466
Want my help?

150
00:10:36,962 --> 00:10:39,272
Absolutely. It's your investigation, too.

151
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:56,528
Calleigh!

152
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,698
I'll call Rescue.

153
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,596
No. No need.

154
00:11:05,913 --> 00:11:07,468
Think she was an innocent bystander?

155
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,916
Her body's not crushed.

156
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,423
Looks like she was
thrown from the plane.

157
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,685
The pilot didn't say anything
about having a passenger, did he?

158
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,113
He was pretty shaken up.

159
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,815
Look at the way she's dressed.

160
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,774
Party girl on a cargo flight?
Something is definitely hinky.

161
00:11:21,355 --> 00:11:22,255
Start with her eyes.

162
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,421
They're different colors,
one blue, one green.

163
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:26,148
Heterochromia?

164
00:11:26,183 --> 00:11:28,148
I think there's a simpler explanation.

165
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:34,642
It's a colored contact lens.

166
00:11:36,384 --> 00:11:37,602
It's Dior Blue.

167
00:11:40,397 --> 00:11:41,659
The other one's missing.

168
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,539
You call Alexx.
I'm gonna find Horatio.

169
00:11:48,518 --> 00:11:49,559
Hey.

170
00:11:49,594 --> 00:11:51,467
We found a DB at the crash site.

171
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,625
Female passenger.

172
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,999
But it wasn't a passenger plane.
Was she killed in the crash?

173
00:11:57,034 --> 00:11:58,943
Her liver temp was 87 degrees.

174
00:11:58,978 --> 00:12:02,003
The body core temperature drops
two degrees the first hour,

175
00:12:02,038 --> 00:12:04,115
a single degree after that, right?

176
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,739
Which puts her time
of death at midnight.

177
00:12:05,974 --> 00:12:07,769
She was dead before they
put her on the plane.

178
00:12:08,592 --> 00:12:10,825
- Where is she now?
- Alexx is posting her.

179
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,125
Do you want me to talk to the pilot?

180
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,653
Not yet. We've got the body.

181
00:12:13,688 --> 00:12:15,093
Let's see what that tells, all right?

182
00:12:15,128 --> 00:12:15,887
All right.

183
00:12:18,142 --> 00:12:19,198
Alexx,

184
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:21,178
anything on the girl from the cargo jet?

185
00:12:21,213 --> 00:12:23,600
Well, the good news is we've got an ID:

186
00:12:23,635 --> 00:12:25,601
Caitlyn Townsend, 20,

187
00:12:25,636 --> 00:12:26,894
Bal Harbour society girl.

188
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:29,254
Family made their fortune
in the citrus industry.

189
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:30,397
What's the bad news?

190
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:32,715
ID came from her family's lawyers.

191
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,963
They've filed an injunction
preventing us from doing an autopsy.

192
00:12:35,998 --> 00:12:38,424
Well, any suspicious death requires one.

193
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:39,693
They have no legal standing.

194
00:12:39,728 --> 00:12:41,445
Well, the judge will go our way,

195
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,771
but they'll tie it up in the
court for at least a week.

196
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:45,223
I can't cut her until then.

197
00:12:45,258 --> 00:12:47,228
And the trail will go cold. Options?

198
00:12:47,263 --> 00:12:48,588
Talk to the family.

199
00:12:49,196 --> 00:12:50,907
See what their objections are.

200
00:12:51,142 --> 00:12:52,849
Or see what they're hiding.

201
00:12:58,315 --> 00:12:59,373
Chairs go around the back.

202
00:13:00,158 --> 00:13:01,999
Champagne goes in the subzero.

203
00:13:02,034 --> 00:13:04,206
Flowers go on the table by the pool.

204
00:13:05,628 --> 00:13:06,502
May I help you?

205
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,765
Yeah, we'd like to
speak to Mrs. Townsend.

206
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,539
I'm Heidi Dillon, her assistant.

207
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:12,689
She's not taking visitors right now.

208
00:13:13,023 --> 00:13:14,089
Her daughter passed away.

209
00:13:14,124 --> 00:13:16,432
Her daughter's death is
why we're here, Miss Dillon.

210
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:19,184
Any idea why she was on the cargo plane?

211
00:13:19,219 --> 00:13:21,904
No. It doesn't make any sense to me.

212
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,156
Is the family having a
wake at the house already?

213
00:13:26,191 --> 00:13:28,306
Caitlin ran a charity
for troubled girls.

214
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,506
This is their big fund-raising weekend.

215
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,937
And you carry on even
after the chairwoman's dead?

216
00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:35,969
This charity was Caitlin's legacy.

217
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:39,267
She dedicated her life to these girls.

218
00:13:41,713 --> 00:13:43,474
Can't even really believe she's gone.

219
00:13:44,797 --> 00:13:46,536
Could I speak to her mother, please?

220
00:13:49,572 --> 00:13:50,981
Okay.

221
00:14:02,222 --> 00:14:03,607
Mrs. Townsend...

222
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:09,276
Ma'am, I'm sorry for your loss.

223
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:14,719
I understand that you
oppose the autopsy.

224
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:17,215
I don't see any point of
putting my daughter through that.

225
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,384
The plane crash killed her.

226
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:21,303
I don't believe that's the case.

227
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:26,999
What do you mean?

228
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:30,045
I'm not sure yet, and
that's why I need your help.

229
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:35,999
No, she's suffered enough.

230
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,559
Ma'am?

231
00:14:42,588 --> 00:14:45,341
Caitlyn had a heroin addiction.

232
00:14:46,603 --> 00:14:48,455
Dropped her down to 90 pounds.

233
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:52,837
You understand that the court will
authorize the autopsy in a few days

234
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:54,075
that's state law.

235
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,476
Please.

236
00:14:57,155 --> 00:14:59,769
Please don't cut my daughter open.

237
00:15:01,705 --> 00:15:04,288
She's at peace now.
Can't you just let her be?

238
00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:13,955
Ma'am, maybe there's a way we
can preserve that peace, okay?

239
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:18,017
A virtopsy.

240
00:15:18,052 --> 00:15:21,346
A virtual autopsy is not
covered in the injunction.

241
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:25,299
Any excuse to try something new.

242
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,891
Most of the injuries are
commensurate with the plane crash.

243
00:16:03,926 --> 00:16:05,047
Broken bones,

244
00:16:05,082 --> 00:16:08,078
but no bleeding or bruising in
the muscle tissue surrounding them.

245
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,463
Meaning they broke postmortem.

246
00:16:10,498 --> 00:16:14,890
Yeah. But Mrs. Townsend
did us quite a favor.

247
00:16:14,925 --> 00:16:17,432
Look at her lungs. They're saturated.

248
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:18,550
See those spots?

249
00:16:18,585 --> 00:16:20,199
Indicate aspiration.

250
00:16:20,234 --> 00:16:21,915
If we'd cut into her,

251
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,402
the pressure in the
lungs might have released,

252
00:16:25,226 --> 00:16:26,836
and we might never have found it.

253
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:28,171
Found what, Alexx?

254
00:16:28,206 --> 00:16:30,215
Caitlyn Townsend drowned.

255
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,359
In what, I can't tell yet.

256
00:16:32,394 --> 00:16:34,755
Maybe I can help there.

257
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,540
Mr. Rydell.

258
00:16:38,575 --> 00:16:40,514
Eric Delko, Crime Lab.

259
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:42,577
Glad to see you're out of surgery.

260
00:16:43,823 --> 00:16:45,869
Yeah, I'm going to have pins
in my leg the rest of my life.

261
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,402
It's better than your copilot.
He's still unconscious.

262
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:51,553
Yeah. Man, I can't
believe this happened.

263
00:16:51,588 --> 00:16:53,704
Talk to me. What did happen, exactly?

264
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:55,740
How did Caitlyn Townsend die?

265
00:16:56,651 --> 00:16:58,610
Uh, Caitlyn Townsend?

266
00:16:58,645 --> 00:17:00,258
She was a passenger on your flight.

267
00:17:01,225 --> 00:17:02,776
What, you're telling me
there was a girl on the plane?

268
00:17:02,811 --> 00:17:04,318
Yeah, a dead girl.

269
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:08,174
Hey, man, I don't know
anything about that.

270
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:12,480
Swap-outs happen on these routes so
fast, checks are in and out in 60 seconds.

271
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,027
So, she came on with the bag of checks?

272
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:24,447
Listen, pit stops, I'm
maintaining the plane.

273
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:25,792
Copilot's in charge of cargo.

274
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:27,722
And conveniently, he's in a coma.

275
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:31,736
Look, man, I'm telling you the truth.

276
00:17:31,771 --> 00:17:33,780
All right, check the freight manifest.

277
00:17:33,815 --> 00:17:34,630
I will.

278
00:17:34,865 --> 00:17:37,246
And if you're lying, well,

279
00:17:37,281 --> 00:17:39,070
I know where to find you.

280
00:17:51,736 --> 00:17:53,007
Think we'll get a print?

281
00:17:53,904 --> 00:17:55,408
I certainly hope so.

282
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:59,429
So, Calliegh...

283
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:02,925
I wanted to talk to you.

284
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,959
Calleigh Duquesne?

285
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,880
Mr. Elliot.

286
00:18:10,826 --> 00:18:12,804
Peter Elliott, Secret Service.

287
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:14,102
Detective John Hagen.

288
00:18:14,137 --> 00:18:14,957
How you doing?

289
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,447
So, how can I help you?

290
00:18:16,482 --> 00:18:19,070
Well, anytime this much
cash shows up, so do I.

291
00:18:19,305 --> 00:18:20,902
Oh, yeah, I was wondering
why I didn't see you

292
00:18:20,903 --> 00:18:22,499
on that counterfeiting
thing a couple weeks back.

293
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,737
I worked it with Horatio.

294
00:18:24,582 --> 00:18:26,816
And I do not even rate a hello?

295
00:18:27,016 --> 00:18:27,925
I came by.

296
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,860
You weren't here.

297
00:18:30,322 --> 00:18:32,747
This is all the money you
recovered from the plane site?

298
00:18:32,782 --> 00:18:33,867
Mm-hmm.

299
00:18:34,502 --> 00:18:38,232
Freshly bundled cash like this has to be
a special request from the Federal Reserve.

300
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:39,029
Okay.

301
00:18:39,364 --> 00:18:40,629
You see this number here?

302
00:18:40,664 --> 00:18:43,830
That tells us which Federal
Reserve issued this bundle.

303
00:18:43,865 --> 00:18:45,309
E5 is Richmond,

304
00:18:45,344 --> 00:18:47,839
so I just enter a serial number,

305
00:18:47,874 --> 00:18:50,630
and with my very high
security clearance...

306
00:18:51,653 --> 00:18:56,387
Bingo. Cash was requested by a Hamilton
Solomon, Biscayne Mutual in Miami.

307
00:18:56,822 --> 00:18:58,071
Great. I'll drive.

308
00:18:58,106 --> 00:18:59,701
John, I'll talk to you later.

309
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:00,438
Okay.

310
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,503
Nice to meet you.

311
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:17,689
Mr. Solomon, you
requested $500,000 in cash

312
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:18,969
from the Federal Reserve.

313
00:19:19,004 --> 00:19:20,433
Who was it for?

314
00:19:21,966 --> 00:19:25,567
We honor this type of
request for special clients.

315
00:19:25,602 --> 00:19:27,174
And who was so special this time?

316
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,629
Caitlyn Townsend.

317
00:19:30,664 --> 00:19:32,608
She had a fund-raiser last night.

318
00:19:32,643 --> 00:19:33,955
Big donors write her checks,

319
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,155
I turn them into cash.

320
00:19:38,297 --> 00:19:40,533
Half a million dollars in cash?
You don't find that suspicious?

321
00:19:40,768 --> 00:19:43,466
I assume that money goes
back into the charity.

322
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:46,620
How do you suppose the cash ended up on
a cargo jet that crashed this morning?

323
00:19:46,655 --> 00:19:48,243
I have no idea.

324
00:19:48,278 --> 00:19:49,981
Couriers took the cash out...

325
00:19:56,705 --> 00:19:57,782
like always.

326
00:19:58,278 --> 00:19:59,281
"Always"?

327
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,117
So, this is not the first time?

328
00:20:02,152 --> 00:20:05,164
As I said, Caitlyn is
a very special client.

329
00:20:07,136 --> 00:20:08,777
Caitlyn is dead, Mr. Solomon.

330
00:20:08,812 --> 00:20:09,575
What?

331
00:20:10,102 --> 00:20:12,262
We'd like to see those
charity checks, please.

332
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:42,042
They're perfect.

333
00:20:42,077 --> 00:20:43,045
All properly endorsed.

334
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,925
I checked the signatures myself.

335
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,812
Actually, I don't think
she signed them at all.

336
00:21:06,691 --> 00:21:07,982
Afternoon, gentlemen.

337
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,107
Mrs. Townsend,

338
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,281
your daughter's charity
was for runaway girls.

339
00:21:12,048 --> 00:21:13,800
Your models are wearing bikinis.

340
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:16,177
This event's been
scheduled for over a year.

341
00:21:16,212 --> 00:21:19,127
Because that's the way
Caitlyn wanted it, right?

342
00:21:19,162 --> 00:21:21,051
I'm honoring my daughter's wishes.

343
00:21:21,086 --> 00:21:22,795
Can I help you with anything else?

344
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,554
Yes, I'm anxious to hear about
her account at Biscayne Mutual.

345
00:21:27,408 --> 00:21:30,256
I don't handle the finances.
Was it charity-related?

346
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,289
In theory.

347
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:33,090
Then you'll have to
talk with Nick Marshall.

348
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:36,024
He co-chairs the
foundation with Caitlyn.

349
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:37,903
And where would we find Mr. Marshall?

350
00:21:37,938 --> 00:21:39,534
He's in the office.

351
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:42,949
Through the bikinis. Perfect.

352
00:21:55,412 --> 00:21:57,727
Taking a pass on your
own party, Mr. Marshall?

353
00:21:57,762 --> 00:21:59,070
I'm not much in the mood.

354
00:21:59,555 --> 00:22:00,660
You understand.

355
00:22:01,423 --> 00:22:03,185
How close were you
with Caitlyn?

356
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:06,793
I met Caitlyn when she wasn't all that
different from the girls we're helping.

357
00:22:06,872 --> 00:22:08,301
I was her counselor.

358
00:22:08,418 --> 00:22:10,227
She asked me to help
run her foundation.

359
00:22:10,338 --> 00:22:13,004
Caitlyn's signatures on
these foundation checks

360
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,670
are perfectly uniform.

361
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:18,202
And nobody signs their name
the same way twice,

362
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:20,079
let alone 100 times.

363
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:21,587
I noticed that,

364
00:22:22,063 --> 00:22:24,158
you have a check
signing machine over there.

365
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:27,666
Caitlyn's wrist cramped up
endorsing all those checks.

366
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,246
I've seen these before.

367
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:45,072
User puts any kind of writing
instrument into the machine.

368
00:22:46,818 --> 00:22:48,056
Its nib...

369
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:50,778
hooks into a signature matrix.

370
00:22:52,032 --> 00:22:54,572
The matrix template turns
and guides the pen.

371
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,846
A letter-perfect signature every time.

372
00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:08,195
To answer your next question,
the only person with

373
00:23:08,275 --> 00:23:11,068
access to that machine
other than Caitlyn was me.

374
00:23:11,347 --> 00:23:13,363
I'm not surprised.
So, you endorsed the checks,

375
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:17,156
turned them into cash and attempted
to transport them out of the state.

376
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,735
I'm not embezzling
from my own charity.

377
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,034
Give me a name.

378
00:23:27,129 --> 00:23:28,795
No, I won't hurt this foundation.

379
00:23:28,906 --> 00:23:31,446
Or risk losing the trust of
the girls we're trying to help.

380
00:23:31,525 --> 00:23:33,128
How civic-minded of you.

381
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:41,125
What's that?

382
00:23:41,157 --> 00:23:44,268
It's a signature matrix
from a signing machine.

383
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,351
Where'd you get it?

384
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,589
Nick Marshall, Caitlyn Townsend's partner.

385
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,994
Cool. Let's have a look.

386
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:28,340
That's Heidi Dillon,
the mother's assistant.

387
00:24:28,705 --> 00:24:30,372
Runaway, theft,

388
00:24:30,642 --> 00:24:32,293
fraud, drug possession.

389
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:36,079
Guess she's one of the charity's
success stories.

390
00:24:36,365 --> 00:24:37,682
Why are your prints

391
00:24:37,864 --> 00:24:39,904
on Caitlyn's signature matrix, Heidi?

392
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,436
Cause she asked me to set up
the machine for her.

393
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:44,916
Detective Salas looked
into your background.

394
00:24:45,726 --> 00:24:47,202
You rehabbed at FutureMore

395
00:24:47,297 --> 00:24:49,218
at the same time as Caitlyn Townsend.

396
00:24:49,424 --> 00:24:51,281
Yeah, we looked out
for one another.

397
00:24:51,877 --> 00:24:55,671
Caitlyn had everything, and even with all
that money, she still ended up on the street.

398
00:24:55,782 --> 00:24:57,592
So, she got you a job
when you got out?

399
00:24:57,694 --> 00:24:59,774
Yes. She talked her mom
into hiring me.

400
00:24:59,885 --> 00:25:02,234
And you repaid the kindness
by stealing from them?

401
00:25:02,409 --> 00:25:03,774
I didn't steal,

402
00:25:03,857 --> 00:25:06,603
I set up Caitlyn's machine.
She wasn't mechanical.

403
00:25:08,167 --> 00:25:10,278
Where'd you get those
cuts on your arms?

404
00:25:10,532 --> 00:25:13,103
Um, from picking up palm fronds
in the back yard.

405
00:25:13,858 --> 00:25:17,397
Are you sure you didn't have
an altercation with Caitlyn last night?

406
00:25:17,992 --> 00:25:19,294
You think I killed her?

407
00:25:20,262 --> 00:25:21,469
Did you?

408
00:25:22,056 --> 00:25:24,183
That's your job to figure out, isn't it?

409
00:25:42,382 --> 00:25:43,573
Can I help you?

410
00:25:43,636 --> 00:25:46,271
Looking for evidence of a
cat fight under her nails.

411
00:25:46,303 --> 00:25:47,573
I already scraped.

412
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,938
Didn't find anything.

413
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:52,152
But I do have a copy of
Caitlyn Townsend's tox report.

414
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:54,057
- Was she back on drugs?
- No.

415
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:59,736
The girl was clean. But substance we suctioned
out of her lungs had high levels of glucose.

416
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,800
Could be some sort of soda,

417
00:26:03,165 --> 00:26:04,371
vitamin water.

418
00:26:04,498 --> 00:26:05,784
Or champagne.

419
00:26:06,224 --> 00:26:08,653
Caitlyn's fund-raiser
last night was at Rev,

420
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,558
the new club on Collin Street.

421
00:26:11,732 --> 00:26:13,859
- I'm gonna find out what happened.
- Little late.

422
00:26:13,938 --> 00:26:16,177
Horatio sent Calleigh and Delko.

423
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:32,276
Must have been only the high rollers
in here last night.

424
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:34,836
The lower the profile,
the bigger the check.

425
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,622
Take a look at this.

426
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:40,971
Champagne bowl.

427
00:26:41,415 --> 00:26:43,170
There's something floating in it.

428
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,928
That's Dior blue if I've ever seen one.

429
00:27:08,845 --> 00:27:10,527
This is our primary crime scene.

430
00:27:17,793 --> 00:27:19,095
I found hair.

431
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:29,047
Signs of a struggle.
It looks like Caitlyn gave one last pull.

432
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:32,000
Got something else.

433
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,539
Print from some kind
of work boot.

434
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:38,104
And not the kind you'd wear
to an event like this.

435
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:40,405
Let's find out who crashed this party.

436
00:27:52,532 --> 00:27:53,850
Excuse me?

437
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:55,842
Can I help you, ma'am?

438
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,984
I'm Calleigh Duquesne
with the Crime Lab.

439
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,794
What's in the bags, Mr. Walsh?

440
00:28:02,072 --> 00:28:03,390
What else?

441
00:28:03,525 --> 00:28:04,747
Checks.

442
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:06,652
No bodies this time?

443
00:28:09,077 --> 00:28:11,013
This is about that girl y'all found.

444
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,724
I heard about it.

445
00:28:13,572 --> 00:28:14,907
I wish I could help you.

446
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,152
Be careful what you wish for.

447
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,485
Now, I don't know
what you mean by that.

448
00:28:21,581 --> 00:28:22,914
I think you do.

449
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:24,910
We found this at the crime scene,

450
00:28:25,085 --> 00:28:26,290
Club Rev.

451
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:32,428
Our lab found aviation grade hydraulic fluid, and my
guess is you were there, and this is a match to your boot.

452
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,560
You want to save me the trouble?

453
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,833
Look.

454
00:28:39,831 --> 00:28:41,052
Look, I got a call

455
00:28:41,131 --> 00:28:42,875
from Nick Marshall, late.

456
00:28:43,002 --> 00:28:44,888
Told he had one more package for me.

457
00:28:45,189 --> 00:28:46,790
And you didn't ask questions?

458
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,871
I showed up, she's just lying there.

459
00:29:06,938 --> 00:29:11,583
And then what was gonna happen? One of your
pilots was gonna dump her over the Atlantic?

460
00:29:12,423 --> 00:29:14,409
Look, I don't mean any disrespect,

461
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,405
but that dead body is just freight.

462
00:29:17,485 --> 00:29:20,472
There's no law against transporting her.

463
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:24,998
Did Nick Marshall tell you
who killed her?

464
00:29:25,077 --> 00:29:27,645
No. Just told me that
he needed it cleaned up.

465
00:29:30,213 --> 00:29:33,563
Well, unfortunately for you, Mr. Walsh,
that is against the law.

466
00:29:34,946 --> 00:29:36,579
It's called being an accessory.

467
00:29:46,138 --> 00:29:50,862
Sean Walsh says you helped
him dispose of Caitlyn's body.

468
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:53,437
Look...

469
00:29:54,468 --> 00:29:56,687
she went all Single White Female on me.

470
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:58,415
- Caitlyn did?
- No,

471
00:29:58,732 --> 00:29:59,882
Heidi Dillon.

472
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:08,319
You know what they say.
You can take the girl out of juvie, but, uh...

473
00:30:08,366 --> 00:30:09,682
Heidi Dillon.

474
00:30:11,941 --> 00:30:13,526
That how you hurt your hand?

475
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,762
Yeah.

476
00:30:16,451 --> 00:30:18,496
No good deed goes
unpunished, right?

477
00:30:18,718 --> 00:30:19,875
That's what they say.

478
00:30:21,438 --> 00:30:23,536
What are you doing? Come on.

479
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:30,339
What-What have I done?
What have I done?

480
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,056
Is she dead?

481
00:30:33,073 --> 00:30:35,839
I think so. You got to get out of here.
Come on, get out of here.

482
00:30:37,305 --> 00:30:39,911
So you called your friend
instead of the authorities.

483
00:30:40,054 --> 00:30:42,454
People find out one
of my girls killed Caitlyn...

484
00:30:42,522 --> 00:30:43,603
Well,

485
00:30:43,984 --> 00:30:46,607
charities don't really recover
from publicity like that.

486
00:30:46,813 --> 00:30:48,148
You may not, either.

487
00:30:51,288 --> 00:30:52,830
Hey, John. How's it going?

488
00:30:53,163 --> 00:30:55,357
Maybe I should ask you
the same question.

489
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,924
What do you mean?

490
00:30:58,449 --> 00:31:00,801
What's with you and
the Secret Service guy?

491
00:31:01,838 --> 00:31:03,141
We're colleagues.

492
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:04,953
Not that it's any of your business.

493
00:31:05,342 --> 00:31:07,075
I can make it my business.

494
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:09,427
Walk away, John.

495
00:31:09,483 --> 00:31:10,786
Are you sleeping with him?

496
00:31:10,881 --> 00:31:12,295
This conversation is over.

497
00:31:14,442 --> 00:31:16,079
What if I don't want it to be over?

498
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:18,734
Then you better remember
what I do for a living.

499
00:31:19,453 --> 00:31:20,724
Calleigh...

500
00:31:44,042 --> 00:31:45,584
Hey, I got your message.

501
00:31:45,918 --> 00:31:48,620
Have the results on that
hair from the crime scene.

502
00:31:49,097 --> 00:31:51,950
Almost all the roots had tags.
Must have been some fight.

503
00:31:52,093 --> 00:31:53,857
Yeah, it was a fight to the death.

504
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:57,421
- What did you find?
- DNA matches Heidi Dillon.

505
00:31:58,788 --> 00:32:01,382
Confirms Nick's story.
Mind if I keep this?

506
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,596
Is there a problem?

507
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:04,498
Something's not adding up.

508
00:32:04,586 --> 00:32:05,889
I'm finished with them.

509
00:32:49,005 --> 00:32:51,907
So, what's the deal? You guys
are gonna arraign me or not?

510
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,573
You can drop the act, Heidi.

511
00:32:53,685 --> 00:32:55,525
Oh, like I've never
heard that before.

512
00:32:55,613 --> 00:32:57,530
We know
where Caitlyn was murdered.

513
00:32:57,823 --> 00:33:00,427
And we found your hair there.
DNA confirms it.

514
00:33:00,953 --> 00:33:01,562
And?

515
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:02,626
And I ran some tests

516
00:33:02,627 --> 00:33:04,285
to see if you were
on anything at the time.

517
00:33:04,553 --> 00:33:05,369
I'm clean.

518
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:06,380
I swear to God.

519
00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:08,050
I have been
since I got off the street.

520
00:33:08,051 --> 00:33:08,768
I know.

521
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,242
Only aberration was
a marked increase

522
00:33:11,243 --> 00:33:12,992
of folic acid.

523
00:33:14,602 --> 00:33:16,084
You're pregnant, aren't you?

524
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:20,864
About ten weeks.

525
00:33:21,612 --> 00:33:23,109
Who's the father?

526
00:33:24,693 --> 00:33:25,911
Nick Marshall.

527
00:33:26,935 --> 00:33:28,695
Is that what you
and Caitlyn were fighting over?

528
00:33:28,696 --> 00:33:29,423
Fighting?

529
00:33:30,046 --> 00:33:31,375
Your hair, remember?

530
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:33,742
Look, I was freaking out.

531
00:33:34,802 --> 00:33:36,886
I'd just told Nick I was pregnant.

532
00:33:37,632 --> 00:33:38,391
Heidi?

533
00:33:40,164 --> 00:33:41,050
What's wrong?

534
00:33:41,418 --> 00:33:42,139
Nothing.

535
00:33:42,885 --> 00:33:43,793
Let me help you.

536
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:44,646
I can't.

537
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,444
I screwed up, Caitlyn.

538
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:49,608
I really screwed up.

539
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:51,411
What's the point?

540
00:33:51,938 --> 00:33:53,471
You guys think I'm guilty, right?

541
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:54,264
Heidi,

542
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,875
pregnant women take folic acid

543
00:33:56,876 --> 00:33:59,341
to prevent birth defects in their babies.

544
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:00,120
I know.

545
00:34:00,524 --> 00:34:01,140
So?

546
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,868
It means you care about this child.

547
00:34:02,869 --> 00:34:04,822
Why take the fall for murder?

548
00:34:07,284 --> 00:34:09,750
'Cause I'll just end up here anyway.

549
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,753
Or is it because you're scared?

550
00:34:14,048 --> 00:34:14,805
Yeah.

551
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:18,086
You know, you know so much...
tell me what else I am.

552
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,929
No, that's it.

553
00:34:21,777 --> 00:34:23,458
You're just scared.

554
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,060
I'm not gonna deny
I had a relationship with Heidi.

555
00:34:33,151 --> 00:34:34,942
She's 19. We were consenting adults.

556
00:34:34,962 --> 00:34:36,997
Till you found out she was pregnant.

557
00:34:37,788 --> 00:34:39,554
You didn't consent to that, did you?

558
00:34:39,974 --> 00:34:41,462
I'll take a paternity test.

559
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:43,936
If I'm the father, I'll honor
my financial obligations.

560
00:34:43,937 --> 00:34:45,375
With embezzled funds.

561
00:34:45,525 --> 00:34:46,435
Right, Nick?

562
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:48,881
I didn't embezzle any money.

563
00:34:48,965 --> 00:34:49,887
Heidi did that.

564
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,846
That's a rather sophisticated move

565
00:34:51,847 --> 00:34:52,936
for a 19 year old.

566
00:34:52,937 --> 00:34:55,943
You sure you didn't put her up to it
and allowed her to take the risk?

567
00:34:56,422 --> 00:34:57,634
If she got help,

568
00:34:58,521 --> 00:34:59,994
it wasn't from me.

569
00:35:00,754 --> 00:35:02,356
The cash on the plane...

570
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,282
you figure out
where that money was going,

571
00:35:04,283 --> 00:35:05,897
you'll find out
what you're looking for.

572
00:35:12,513 --> 00:35:14,945
This flight plan says the cargo jet
was heading to Atlanta,

573
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,433
loaded with mortgage checks.

574
00:35:16,722 --> 00:35:20,595
Not to mention all that embezzled cash
from Caitlyn Townsend's charity.

575
00:35:20,962 --> 00:35:22,365
Where do you think it was going?

576
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,140
A bank?

577
00:35:23,228 --> 00:35:24,996
There's over a
thousand banks in Atlanta.

578
00:35:25,654 --> 00:35:26,998
This could take a while.

579
00:35:27,228 --> 00:35:29,191
Unless we're not looking
in the right place.

580
00:35:29,197 --> 00:35:31,286
It seems like Atlanta
wasn't the first stop.

581
00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:33,045
There was a secondary destination?

582
00:35:35,101 --> 00:35:36,131
"CHS."

583
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:37,988
It's an airport identification code.

584
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,504
Charleston, South Carolina.

585
00:35:40,745 --> 00:35:43,993
Well, I bet they
didn't think we'd find that.

586
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,969
What do you see?

587
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,361
Treasury database.

588
00:35:47,362 --> 00:35:50,379
Deposits over 10,000
have to be reported to the Feds.

589
00:35:51,075 --> 00:35:53,534
That's right. Anything under,
it doesn't raise a red flag.

590
00:35:53,605 --> 00:35:54,476
It does now... banks track

591
00:35:54,477 --> 00:35:56,890
unusual deposit patterns under 10,000.

592
00:35:56,953 --> 00:35:57,926
When they find one,

593
00:35:57,999 --> 00:36:00,105
they file a Suspicious Activity Report.

594
00:36:01,441 --> 00:36:03,667
Hey, wait a minute. Check that out.

595
00:36:04,004 --> 00:36:05,732
The Pummelo Corporation.

596
00:36:06,435 --> 00:36:10,872
31 deposits, all cash.
All between $5,000 and $9,000.

597
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,304
So?

598
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:15,902
A pummelo is a large Asian fruit
with a thick outer skin.

599
00:36:15,991 --> 00:36:18,906
Wow, you really know your citrus.

600
00:36:18,934 --> 00:36:19,666
Thank you.

601
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,288
So does Sophie Townsend.

602
00:36:21,325 --> 00:36:24,217
Her family made millions of dollars
in the Florida citrus industry.

603
00:36:29,564 --> 00:36:32,182
Lieutenant, I've told you
everything I can about my daughter.

604
00:36:32,252 --> 00:36:35,237
This is not about your daughter,
Mrs. Townsend. This is about you.

605
00:36:37,009 --> 00:36:38,586
Do I need to get a lawyer?

606
00:36:38,769 --> 00:36:40,108
Something to think about.

607
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,317
Why don't you tell us
about the Pummelo Corporation?

608
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:48,147
In my world, there are certain...

609
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,365
expectations.

610
00:36:50,829 --> 00:36:53,050
The pressure to live up
to the family name.

611
00:36:53,193 --> 00:36:54,518
You have money.

612
00:36:56,345 --> 00:36:58,924
The citrus freeze two years ago ruined us.

613
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,509
We were flat broke.

614
00:37:01,406 --> 00:37:05,906
My husband died, Caitlyn went back
into rehab, and I had to make choices.

615
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,608
Choices as in looting
your daughter's charity,

616
00:37:08,808 --> 00:37:09,606
right?

617
00:37:10,476 --> 00:37:12,001
You had Heidi Dillon

618
00:37:12,068 --> 00:37:14,412
do the dirty work.
She used a signing machine

619
00:37:14,417 --> 00:37:17,428
to forge Caitlyn's signature
onto the contribution checks.

620
00:37:17,629 --> 00:37:20,531
Turned them into cash and deposited
them in your Charleston account.

621
00:37:20,951 --> 00:37:22,754
Heidi only did what I asked her.

622
00:37:23,019 --> 00:37:24,108
How about murder?

623
00:37:24,844 --> 00:37:25,850
Did she do that?

624
00:37:26,437 --> 00:37:27,498
Lieutenant Caine,

625
00:37:28,315 --> 00:37:30,315
I have done some horrible things,

626
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,474
but I did not kill my daughter.

627
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:33,953
Then you will allow me

628
00:37:33,954 --> 00:37:37,653
to perform the formal autopsy
so I can figure out who did.

629
00:38:14,675 --> 00:38:16,446
Found this in the stomach contents.

630
00:38:16,447 --> 00:38:18,138
Number 11 cuspid.

631
00:38:18,231 --> 00:38:20,180
She swallowed her own tooth.

632
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,311
Didn't show up in the Virtopsy.

633
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:24,756
MRI doesn't read bones,

634
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:25,724
only marrow.

635
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:26,791
Alexx,

636
00:38:26,969 --> 00:38:28,929
you can't swallow after you're dead.

637
00:38:29,034 --> 00:38:29,691
Right.

638
00:38:29,951 --> 00:38:32,385
Means this tooth didn't
come out in the plane crash.

639
00:38:32,513 --> 00:38:34,809
It means she was hit
while she was still alive.

640
00:38:34,911 --> 00:38:36,594
It took a lot of force.

641
00:38:36,623 --> 00:38:37,930
She was hit hard.

642
00:38:38,289 --> 00:38:40,438
I doubt a female could have
landed that punch.

643
00:38:46,768 --> 00:38:48,580
Alexx, the thing about getting hit is

644
00:38:48,648 --> 00:38:51,006
the hitter receives a mark,
too, don't they?

645
00:38:52,234 --> 00:38:53,350
Got anyone in mind?

646
00:38:53,451 --> 00:38:56,080
No good deed goes unpunished.

647
00:38:59,747 --> 00:39:00,966
Let's get this thing airborne.

648
00:39:00,967 --> 00:39:03,322
I want to make it to Spider Key
while the sun's still up.

649
00:39:03,324 --> 00:39:03,665
Yes Sir.

650
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:05,286
You going somewhere, Nick?

651
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:10,346
Taking a couple of days off.
I thought I'd head out to the Keys.

652
00:39:12,888 --> 00:39:15,002
I think you mean a short hop

653
00:39:15,006 --> 00:39:19,112
to a Caribbean country
with no extradition laws.

654
00:39:21,453 --> 00:39:22,983
You just don't quit, do you?

655
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:24,353
Not in my vocabulary.

656
00:39:25,381 --> 00:39:26,772
How many times
do I have to tell you?

657
00:39:26,773 --> 00:39:28,703
I had nothing to do
with Caitlyn's death.

658
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:32,745
The laceration on your hand
tells me otherwise.

659
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:35,579
- It's just a scratch.
- It's a fight bite.

660
00:39:36,301 --> 00:39:39,575
The human mouth is loaded with bacteria.

661
00:39:48,978 --> 00:39:51,667
You're not making any sense.
Why would I do that to her?

662
00:39:52,146 --> 00:39:54,261
Heidi's unplanned pregnancy, Nick.

663
00:39:54,285 --> 00:39:57,357
You were supposed to protect
these girls. And Caitlyn found out.

664
00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:01,441
I can't believe this!
This is my charity!

665
00:40:01,487 --> 00:40:03,188
How many other girls
have you done this to?!

666
00:40:03,223 --> 00:40:04,889
Caitlyn, you're overreacting.
Calm down.

667
00:40:05,751 --> 00:40:06,944
I am calm, Nick.

668
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:08,629
You're fired.

669
00:40:08,735 --> 00:40:09,776
Are you kidding me?

670
00:40:09,811 --> 00:40:11,871
When I first met you,
you were a junkie.

671
00:40:12,168 --> 00:40:14,684
I kicked heroin.
Now I'm kicking you.

672
00:40:15,171 --> 00:40:16,744
Don't you turn your back on me.

673
00:40:29,267 --> 00:40:30,577
She was a spoiled,

674
00:40:30,938 --> 00:40:33,932
little rich girl
with a $1,000-a-day habit.

675
00:40:34,303 --> 00:40:38,065
I introduced her to the right people,
I got her into the right parties.

676
00:40:38,174 --> 00:40:42,049
I worked my ass off for her.
No vacations, no overtime.

677
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:46,978
I created Caitlyn Townsend.

678
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:54,225
That didn't give you
the right to destroy her.

679
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:01,329
Yeah?

680
00:41:01,386 --> 00:41:03,153
You know that vacation
you never got?

681
00:42:27,306 --> 00:42:29,043
You knew he killed Caitlyn,
didn't you?

682
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,671
You saw him.

683
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,340
Why didn't you say anything?

684
00:42:34,871 --> 00:42:35,831
I couldn't.

685
00:42:36,217 --> 00:42:37,972
So you were just gonna take the fall?

686
00:42:38,402 --> 00:42:41,999
Nick just, you know, he gets so angry,
I just... I couldn't risk it.

687
00:42:43,786 --> 00:42:45,774
You were afraid he'd kill you.

688
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:50,093
I was afraid he'd kill us.

689
00:42:56,301 --> 00:42:59,693
