1
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,992
<i>Long ago, when the pyramids
were still young, -</i>

2
00:00:35,237 --> 00:00:39,537
<i>- Egyptian kings played a game
of great and terrible power.</i>

3
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:44,476
<i>They did battle with magic and
monsters for riches and glory.</i>

4
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:47,548
<i>From these Shadow Games
erupted a war -</i>

5
00:00:47,717 --> 00:00:50,083
<i>- that threatened to
destroy the world, -</i>

6
00:00:50,252 --> 00:00:54,712
<i>- until a brave and powerful pharaoh
locked the dark magic away, -</i>

7
00:00:54,924 --> 00:01:00,385
<i>- imprisoning it for all eternity within
the mystical Millennium Items.</i>

8
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,726
<i>But even eternity
doesn't last forever.</i>

9
00:01:09,806 --> 00:01:14,641
<i>It was never to happen, and
for 5000 years it never did.</i>

10
00:01:14,811 --> 00:01:18,975
<i>The secret of the Millennium Puzzle
remain safely beyond reach.</i>

11
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:23,984
<i>Within the imponderable conundrum
of it's intricate design.</i>

12
00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:28,521
<i>For a boy named Yugi, the mystery
of the Millennium Puzzle -</i>

13
00:01:28,692 --> 00:01:29,989
<i>- remains just that.</i>

14
00:01:30,193 --> 00:01:36,257
<i>The solution, if one exists, eludes him
as it did those that came before him.</i>

15
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:39,902
<i>But this time, fate has played
a hand in bringing the puzzle -</i>

16
00:01:40,103 --> 00:01:43,266
<i>- and this person together.</i>

17
00:01:48,645 --> 00:01:50,408
<i>It was never to happen.</i>

18
00:01:50,614 --> 00:01:54,050
<i>And for 5000 years it never did.</i>

19
00:01:54,217 --> 00:01:56,913
<i>But while the desert
does it's best to conceal -</i>

20
00:01:57,087 --> 00:01:59,317
<i>- that which should
remain burried, -</i>

21
00:01:59,523 --> 00:02:04,324
<i>- it eventually yielded it's most
ancient and terrible secrets.</i>

22
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:13,129
We found it. The lost
tomb of Anubis.

23
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:31,889
Professor, what do you
make of this? It's amazing.

24
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:35,819
What possessed them to put
the sarcophagus in chains?

25
00:02:38,496 --> 00:02:39,895
Hey, all right!

26
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:44,368
Maybe this one next.

27
00:02:45,603 --> 00:02:48,128
Yeah! One to go.

28
00:02:48,372 --> 00:02:51,705
I've almost solved the
Millennium Puzzle.

29
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,637
Now what have we here?

30
00:03:08,593 --> 00:03:11,027
Grandpa is sure gonna be surprised
when he sees I've figured -

31
00:03:11,195 --> 00:03:13,095
- this puzzle out all by myself.

32
00:03:13,464 --> 00:03:16,332
The last piece.

33
00:03:17,236 --> 00:03:19,329
This is it.

34
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:36,546
Awesome! I did it. The
Millennium Puzzle's complete.

35
00:03:51,737 --> 00:03:53,796
What's going on?

36
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:04,179
- There still are men in there.
- The cave collapses.

37
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:06,977
This tomb is cursed.

38
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:23,735
Hey! What is this?

39
00:04:48,895 --> 00:04:52,092
Yu-Gi-Oh!

40
00:05:03,476 --> 00:05:07,537
Shadow Creatures. Begone.
I command you!

41
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,578
Return to the dark realm
from whence you came!

42
00:05:20,593 --> 00:05:25,087
<i>It was never to happen but
after 5000 years it did.</i>

43
00:05:25,298 --> 00:05:29,702
<i>And with it the Shadow
Games begin again.</i>

44
00:05:53,193 --> 00:05:56,629
<i>In the three short years since
he started playing Duel Monsters -</i>

45
00:05:56,864 --> 00:05:59,662
<i>- Yugi Moto has risen to
international stardom, -</i>

46
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:03,633
<i>- by becoming the world wide Duel
Monsters card-playing champion.</i>

47
00:06:03,837 --> 00:06:07,102
<i>But what makes this young
man such a talented duelist?</i>

48
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:10,469
<i>Is it his masterly strategies?
Or does the secret lie in the -</i>

49
00:06:10,678 --> 00:06:13,442
<i>- powerful God Cards he's
assembled in his deck?</i>

50
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:18,141
<i>Whatever the reason, Yugi has proven
his dueling powers time and again.</i>

51
00:06:18,352 --> 00:06:21,685
<i>He has reigned victorious in the
most prestigious tournaments, -</i>

52
00:06:21,855 --> 00:06:24,449
<i>- including the Duelist
Kingdom competition.</i>

53
00:06:24,725 --> 00:06:27,819
<i>And most reasonly the Battle City
Finals where once again -</i>

54
00:06:28,062 --> 00:06:31,361
<i>- Yugi defeated former champ
Seto Kaiba to win it all.</i>

55
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:33,659
Gimme a break. I bet
I could do a circle -

56
00:06:33,868 --> 00:06:35,859
- around this little high
school pipsqueak.

57
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,198
<i>Yugi says his success is due
to his grandfather's coaching -</i>

58
00:06:39,374 --> 00:06:41,740
<i>- and to his belief in the
heart of the cards.</i>

59
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,743
If he'd play me for those God Cards
I'd take that chump down in a flash.

60
00:06:46,247 --> 00:06:48,738
<i>But other say it is the
three Egyptian God Cards -</i>

61
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,282
<i>- that make Yugi
virtually unbeatable.</i>

62
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:55,822
<i>And so the gauntlet is thrown.
Can anyone defeat Yugi Moto -</i>

63
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,448
<i>- and his unstoppable
Egyptian God Cards?</i>

64
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:03,162
You wanted a rematch, Seto Kaiba?

65
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:05,230
You've got one.

66
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,200
And this time things are gonna end
differently, you pompous windbag.

67
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:16,310
Even you must admit that your
Blue-Eyes White Dragon -

68
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:18,911
- is powerless against my
Egyptian God Cards.

69
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:23,208
Make all the smug pronouncements
you like, but know this:

70
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:26,218
There's got to be a way
to beat your God Cards.

71
00:07:26,388 --> 00:07:28,413
And I won't stop until I find it.

72
00:07:29,758 --> 00:07:32,249
Now I activate the Magic Card -

73
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:35,224
- Polymerization.

74
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:39,165
This allows me to fuse my
three dragons together, -

75
00:07:39,335 --> 00:07:42,303
- to form Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.

76
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,698
And that's just for starters.

77
00:07:48,277 --> 00:07:52,475
Next I play a Magic Card that doubles
my dragon's attack points:

78
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:55,242
Megamorph.

79
00:07:57,953 --> 00:08:01,675
Now my Blue-Eyes is more powerful
than any monster on the field.

80
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,659
There is more to power
than just attack points.

81
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:07,792
And just what is that
supposed to mean?

82
00:08:07,997 --> 00:08:12,525
It means my Egyptian God Cards possess
powers far beyond meer monsters.

83
00:08:12,768 --> 00:08:15,601
- They what?
- By sacrificing two of them -

84
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:20,299
- I can bestow upon the
third, infinite strength.

85
00:08:22,144 --> 00:08:25,113
They are melting.
Hooling their energy.

86
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,985
Now my Obelisk the Tormentor is
the strongest monster in play.

87
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:41,523
No, I can beat your God Cards.
I won't lose to you again.

88
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:48,402
Obelisk the Tormentor, show him
what true power is all about.

89
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,401
Attack with Fist of Fury!

90
00:09:04,855 --> 00:09:06,516
No.

91
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:11,520
My dragon.

92
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:18,292
<i>- No!
- System overload!</i>

93
00:09:18,568 --> 00:09:21,503
The simulation is malfunctioning.

94
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,571
I'm sorry, Mr. Kaiba, but I was
certain that our calculations -

95
00:09:26,743 --> 00:09:29,007
- were correct this time, sir.

96
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:31,574
If you just give us one
more chance, sir.

97
00:09:31,848 --> 00:09:34,339
So you can fail again? Sorry.

98
00:09:34,551 --> 00:09:37,987
Please, sir. We're close to
postulating a winning strategem.

99
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:42,416
Well if I were you I'd start
postulating myself a new job.

100
00:09:43,426 --> 00:09:45,724
You've had more than enough
time to find a way to beat -

101
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:50,492
- Yugi's Egyptian God Cards. But
as usual I have to do it myself.

102
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:53,203
- Now, get out!
- Ah, man.

103
00:09:54,872 --> 00:09:57,966
<i>There's gotta be some way
to defeat Yugi's God Cards.</i>

104
00:09:58,175 --> 00:10:00,643
<i>And I think I know
were to start looking.</i>

105
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:49,682
The God Cards?

106
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,915
What a horrible nightmare.

107
00:11:19,191 --> 00:11:24,094
That's it, no more white wine
spritzers before bedtime for me.

108
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:32,396
Looks peaceful enough.
Yet I sense chaos.

109
00:11:32,638 --> 00:11:35,664
I may have lost my Millennium
Eye some time ago, -

110
00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:40,867
- but I can still see that something
terrible is about to unfold.

111
00:11:48,286 --> 00:11:52,086
About time the museum got a descent
display of Egyptian artifacts.

112
00:11:53,425 --> 00:11:56,588
Hey, that looks just like
a Millennium Item.

113
00:11:57,629 --> 00:11:59,927
This I gotta see.

114
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:11,574
<i>This is flight command.</i>

115
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:14,235
<i>Initiating Duel Dome
launch convertion. Over.</i>

116
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:16,779
<i>Roger, dock command.
Prepare launch station -</i>

117
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:18,917
<i>- for immediate dragon-flight. Over.</i>

118
00:12:19,252 --> 00:12:23,279
<i>We show Mr. Kaiba now
approaching primary flight deck.</i>

119
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:31,456
Begin complete
systems check at once.

120
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:33,932
<i>- Roger. Vector gauge.
- Check.</i>

121
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:35,828
<i>- Navigation sensors.
- Check.</i>

122
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:40,766
<i>- Ready the launch pad.
- Yes, sir. Opening hangar doors.</i>

123
00:12:47,613 --> 00:12:50,605
<i>Blue-Eyes White Jet,
you are clear for take-off.</i>

124
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,614
Activating main thrust rockets.

125
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:02,955
<i>- I hope you know what you're doing.
- I was just hoping the same thing.</i>

126
00:14:02,956 --> 00:14:04,548
Red wine spritzer, sir.

127
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:13,897
Can it be? My dear friend Kaiba-boy.

128
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:15,830
Spare me the pleasantries, Pegasus.

129
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:19,836
You and I have never been friends,
so let's not start pretending that we are.

130
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,509
Oh, my. Sounds like
someone's need a hug.

131
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,339
No, thanks. But since you mentioned it,
there is something I need.

132
00:14:26,548 --> 00:14:29,278
Listen. I've come to your
little fantasy island -

133
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,187
- in search of a card powerful enough
to beat Yugi's three Egyptian God Cards.

134
00:14:33,188 --> 00:14:37,818
And you believe I'd might have this
all-powerful God-smiting Card because?

135
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:40,725
Because you created
the game, Pegasus.

136
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:44,456
Once upon a time, Kaiba-boy,
but I'm retired now.

137
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:49,403
The only things I create these days are
places like this for the fishies to enjoy.

138
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:51,998
I know you, Pegasus.
You created the God Cards -

139
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,471
- and would have never let them
out of your sweaty little hands, -

140
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:58,305
- unless you also created
a way to beat them. 

141
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:01,209
- Just in case.
- Oh, very well, I confess. 

142
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,579
I may have one card that could
help, but you can't have it.

143
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:07,846
- What?
- I'm sorry, Kaiba-boy, -

144
00:15:08,022 --> 00:15:10,286
- but I don't think you deserve it.

145
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,586
True I may not see
as well as I once did.

146
00:15:13,795 --> 00:15:16,389
But to be honest, it
doesn't take a magic eye -

147
00:15:16,564 --> 00:15:20,433
- to see just how thoroughly Yugi has
trounced your sorry behind again and again.

148
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:22,501
Quite frankly it is embarrassing.

149
00:15:22,738 --> 00:15:26,071
Well since I'm such a disappointment,
you should have no trouble -

150
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:29,507
- defeating me in a duel.
- And why would I duel you?

151
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:34,110
Because if you'll put up the card I
need to beat Yugi, I'll wager these.

152
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,319
Wow, you'd rish your precious
Blue-Eyes White Dragons, -

153
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:39,954
- just for a chance to
trounce little Yugi?

154
00:15:40,155 --> 00:15:43,750
My, my, my, seems you're even
more desperate than I thought.

155
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:47,595
Well I guess I could dust off my deck.

156
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:53,729
Kaiba, my dear and devious
friend, let the games begin.

157
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:56,537
- Come on
- Let's go everybody.

158
00:15:57,673 --> 00:15:59,641
- Wonder what all the commotion's about?
- Don't know.

159
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:02,709
But I haven't seen this many people
running from school since they served -

160
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,608
- meat loaf surprise last year.

161
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:08,610
- What in the...
- Let me see.

162
00:16:08,817 --> 00:16:11,809
Wonder who these guys
are all waiting for.

163
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:13,818
It's him.

164
00:16:14,023 --> 00:16:16,958
Told you he's alot
smaller than on tv.

165
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,820
Me first. Let me at him.

166
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:21,758
Please just give me one
shot at those God Cards.

167
00:16:21,931 --> 00:16:24,958
Get out of my way! If anyone
gets the God Cards, it's me.

168
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:28,432
- Help me!
- What's going on with these guys?

169
00:16:28,638 --> 00:16:32,506
Life on the top, Téa. Everyone knows
Yugi is the best duelist around.

170
00:16:32,676 --> 00:16:35,144
So they all want a piece of
him, and those God Cards.

171
00:16:35,378 --> 00:16:38,541
Téa, try to sneak Yugi around the
back, while we hold them off.

172
00:16:38,715 --> 00:16:41,684
- You're sure?
- Yeah, me and Tristan will handle things here.

173
00:16:41,885 --> 00:16:45,685
- Thanks, Joey.
- You can thank him later. Let's go, Yugi.

174
00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:52,217
- The usual plan, T?
- On three, partner.

175
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:54,863
- On three.
- Quick, after them.

176
00:16:55,065 --> 00:16:57,898
Forget about those nobodies.

177
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:00,631
- Now wait just a minute.
- What'd you say?

178
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,770
I said you're nobody.

179
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,407
Yeah, that's right. And
everybody knows it too.

180
00:17:05,575 --> 00:17:07,770
Well just everybody
who's anybody, that is.

181
00:17:08,011 --> 00:17:10,844
Listen up. Nobody but
nobody calls me a nobody, -

182
00:17:11,014 --> 00:17:15,178
- a bunch of nobodies. Got that?
- We wanna take on Yugi, not you.

183
00:17:15,352 --> 00:17:17,320
- Yeah, right.
- We want the King of Games, -

184
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,489
- not the King of Lame.
- The Duel Monsters champ, not chump.

185
00:17:20,724 --> 00:17:23,522
The Master of the Gods, not
the Master of the Clods.

186
00:17:23,727 --> 00:17:26,696
I think I get the point, already.
But you gotta prove yourselves first, -

187
00:17:26,896 --> 00:17:29,694
- by doing top-contender,
and I think I know one.

188
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:32,028
- Seto Kaiba?
- Me! Joey Wheeler.

189
00:17:32,236 --> 00:17:34,431
So if you wanna get
to the King of Games -

190
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:40,076
- you'll have to go through me,
the Godfather of Games, capiche.

191
00:17:49,587 --> 00:17:52,385
- All right, so who wants some?
- I wants some.

192
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,081
Won't take long. Let's do this.

193
00:17:55,326 --> 00:17:57,624
Okay, ladies first. 

194
00:17:58,896 --> 00:18:00,989
Funny. Take this!

195
00:18:01,265 --> 00:18:05,133
I summon Injection Fairy
Lily in attack mode.

196
00:18:08,205 --> 00:18:10,298
Hi, there.

197
00:18:12,343 --> 00:18:14,038
Let's give him a check-up, Lily.

198
00:18:14,211 --> 00:18:15,838
Say ah!

199
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,580
What the...

200
00:18:24,822 --> 00:18:29,452
I sacrifice Fenrir and Inpachi in
order to summon Maju Garzett.

201
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,890
Attack! Sludge Regurgitate.

202
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:47,474
Hey, didn't nobody ever teach you
to say it, not spray it? Some menace.

203
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,147
Or, boy. Now you're in trouble.

204
00:18:50,348 --> 00:18:54,216
I sacrifice Baby Dragon, Rocket
Warrior and Little-Winguard -

205
00:18:54,453 --> 00:18:57,183
- to summon Gilford the Lightning.

206
00:18:57,422 --> 00:19:01,358
Which means all the monsters you got
out on the field are destroyed, pal.

207
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,585
Lightning Sword.

208
00:19:10,368 --> 00:19:11,960
Ah, nuts!

209
00:19:14,606 --> 00:19:17,507
Maybe now, you'll have the
proper respect for Joey -

210
00:19:17,676 --> 00:19:19,735
- the Godfather of Games.

211
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:21,672
Is the coast clear yet, Joey?

212
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,440
Hey, it's Yugi. He's back.

213
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:27,413
- Let's go, Yugi.
- You better watch out.

214
00:19:27,586 --> 00:19:30,111
We're gonna get ya.

215
00:19:34,192 --> 00:19:38,424
- Yeah, they respect ya.
- I've could have been a contender.

216
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:43,666
Quick! Yugi, this way.

217
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:50,073
Those guys just won't give up.
We need to find a place to hide.

218
00:19:50,243 --> 00:19:53,303
Some place where we will be save
from that Duel Monsters mob.

219
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:55,376
Some place they'd never look.

220
00:19:56,082 --> 00:19:57,913
So want do you think, Kaiba-boy?

221
00:19:58,084 --> 00:20:01,713
Is this the latest in duel arena
technology, or what?

222
00:20:01,888 --> 00:20:03,788
This place is an outdated joke.

223
00:20:04,023 --> 00:20:06,753
But then so are you,
so I suppose it fits.

224
00:20:07,026 --> 00:20:11,429
Now, now, Kaiba, let's not get
nasty. Not just yet, anyhow.

225
00:20:12,198 --> 00:20:14,723
Look, enough small talk.

226
00:20:15,535 --> 00:20:16,866
Let's duel!

227
00:20:17,036 --> 00:20:18,901
I'll start things off.

228
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:24,571
Oh, dear, I'm afraid you're about to
enter into a world of pain, Kaiba-boy.

229
00:20:24,777 --> 00:20:28,235
A world of chaos. A world
of absolute mayhem.

230
00:20:29,081 --> 00:20:33,415
That's right. A world of Toons.

231
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:42,091
Ha, don't tell me that you're actually
still using that idiotic Toon World card.

232
00:20:42,295 --> 00:20:45,594
Well, this is gonna be even
easier than I thought.

233
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:49,958
I summon Toon Gemini
Elf in attack mode.

234
00:20:57,177 --> 00:20:58,906
And this for later.

235
00:20:59,146 --> 00:21:01,307
It's your turn, Kaiba-boy.

236
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,118
I summon X-Head Cannon.

237
00:21:12,326 --> 00:21:15,295
I'll throw two cards face down.

238
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:17,226
For later.

239
00:21:17,464 --> 00:21:20,763
Uh, I'm so scared, Kaiba.
Two cards face down.

240
00:21:20,934 --> 00:21:23,368
Oh, mercy me, what will I do?

241
00:21:23,704 --> 00:21:27,037
No wait that I now play this.

242
00:21:27,307 --> 00:21:29,775
Card of Sanctity.

243
00:21:31,411 --> 00:21:34,073
Isn't it pretty? And it allows us
each to draw until we both -

244
00:21:34,281 --> 00:21:36,875
- have six cards in our hand.

245
00:21:38,885 --> 00:21:43,481
<i>Just what I needed.</i>And now
I'll activate the Magic Card Cost Down.</i>

246
00:21:43,657 --> 00:21:46,285
- Which means that.
- Do you ever shut up?

247
00:21:46,526 --> 00:21:49,927
I know what it means. Now you can summon
your strongest monsters to the field -

248
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,597
- more easily.

249
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:53,994
Please, what do you take me
for, some kind of a rookie?

250
00:21:54,235 --> 00:21:57,068
You're not quite that
good, Kaiba-boy.

251
00:21:57,238 --> 00:22:00,036
I summon the Toon Dark Magician Girl.

252
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:04,107
But I won't be using her just yet.

253
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:07,715
First I'll attack with
the Gemini Elves.

254
00:22:08,249 --> 00:22:10,843
And I think I'll have
them target... -

255
00:22:13,688 --> 00:22:15,155
- you.

256
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:19,822
Cartoons are so violent
these days.

257
00:22:19,994 --> 00:22:23,157
But we're not through yet.
My elves have another ability.

258
00:22:23,398 --> 00:22:28,665
When they deal damage to a player,
that player loses a card from his hand.

259
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:33,637
Aren't my Toons simply
magnificent, Kaiba-boy?

260
00:22:35,243 --> 00:22:36,733
Oh, don't look so sour.

261
00:22:36,978 --> 00:22:41,415
Think of it this way, at least it will be them
stopping you little quest to the top and not -

262
00:22:41,582 --> 00:22:43,743
- Yugi-boy for the umpteenth time.

263
00:22:43,951 --> 00:22:49,947
Now then, let's get on with it, shall we?
Oh, Toon Dark Magician Girl, your turn.

264
00:22:51,459 --> 00:22:55,293
I guess it's true that when you get old,
the mind is the first thing to go, because -

265
00:22:55,463 --> 00:22:57,931
- you forgot all about
my face down cards.

266
00:22:58,132 --> 00:23:00,693
And now it's gonna cost you.

267
00:23:03,739 --> 00:23:05,206
Attack Guidance Armor.

268
00:23:05,407 --> 00:23:09,537
This trap's like a magnet that redirects
your own attack right back at you.

269
00:23:09,778 --> 00:23:11,746
No, you wouldn't.

270
00:23:12,047 --> 00:23:14,038
Oh, yes I would. And I will.

271
00:23:14,283 --> 00:23:19,448
Guidance Armor, attach to
the Toon Gemini Elves.

272
00:23:40,843 --> 00:23:43,607
But they were just innocent Toons.

273
00:23:43,846 --> 00:23:46,007
You'll pay for that.

274
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:51,275
I activate the Magic Card Monster
Reborn to bring them back.

275
00:23:53,989 --> 00:23:55,957
And play Ultimate Offering.

276
00:23:56,225 --> 00:24:01,026
Now for every 500 life points I give up,
I can summon one additional monster.

277
00:24:01,196 --> 00:24:04,758
And by sacrificing my
Toon Gemini Elf, Kaiba-boy, -

278
00:24:04,968 --> 00:24:08,199
- this first monster will be
quite a powerful one.

279
00:24:08,371 --> 00:24:12,068
Introducing the Blue-Eyes
Toon Dragon.

280
00:24:15,478 --> 00:24:17,309
Looks rather vicious, doesn't he?

281
00:24:17,514 --> 00:24:21,575
But don't you worry yourself,
Kaiba-boy, he is actually quite docile. 

282
00:24:21,785 --> 00:24:24,652
Well, compared to
the next Toon, that is.

283
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:29,621
Ladies and gents, the 
Toon Summoned Skull.

284
00:24:31,327 --> 00:24:34,455
Sure, I'll have to give up
another 500 of my life ponts, -

285
00:24:34,664 --> 00:24:36,757
- but then, you know what
they say, Kaiba-boy:

286
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,369
You have to spend life
points to take life points.

287
00:24:41,538 --> 00:24:43,472
Of course, you know all about that.

288
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,599
Yugi's been taking your life points
for what, going on three years now?

289
00:24:47,844 --> 00:24:51,211
Oh, I'm sorry to keep
bringing that up.

290
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:55,976
I activate the Magic Card Dark Core.

291
00:24:56,419 --> 00:24:58,751
Now by discarding one
card from my hand, -

292
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,287
- I can remove any
monster from the game.

293
00:25:01,691 --> 00:25:03,022
I see.

294
00:25:03,193 --> 00:25:05,787
Well then, I'm sorry
Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon, -

295
00:25:05,995 --> 00:25:08,088
- but I guess this is goodbye.

296
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:11,631
Not quite, Pegasus. You won't
be getting off that easily, -

297
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,999
- because I'm discarding Y-Dragon
 Head from my hand.

298
00:25:15,206 --> 00:25:18,539
So I can remove X-Head
Cannon from the game.

299
00:25:19,243 --> 00:25:21,905
What? But X-Head Cannon
is your own monster.

300
00:25:22,112 --> 00:25:23,545
What are you scheming?

301
00:25:23,747 --> 00:25:26,409
I also activate the Magic
Card Soul Release.

302
00:25:26,617 --> 00:25:29,085
It removes one more
monster from the game -

303
00:25:29,253 --> 00:25:31,380
- and I'm using it on
my Y-Dragon Head.

304
00:25:31,589 --> 00:25:33,819
Why are you removing
your own monsters?

305
00:25:34,024 --> 00:25:36,322
And now, I summon -

306
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:39,190
- Z-Metal Tank.

307
00:25:40,898 --> 00:25:42,866
That makes no sense, unless...

308
00:25:43,534 --> 00:25:47,197
Unless I still have one
more card to play, Pegasus.

309
00:25:47,404 --> 00:25:49,099
And it so happens I do.

310
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:52,137
Activate Return from the
Different Dimension.

311
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:55,936
It's well worth half my life points
to bring back all my monsters.

312
00:25:56,146 --> 00:26:00,549
And nice trick to know when you wanna
summon more than one monster in a turn.

313
00:26:01,552 --> 00:26:06,046
And as you're well aware, these aren't
just any monsters, Pegasus.

314
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,588
They combine.

315
00:26:15,266 --> 00:26:20,102
Together they create the
ultimate XYZ-Dragon Cannon.

316
00:26:22,307 --> 00:26:27,540
Yes, now I have all the firepower I need
to blast any card I want out of the duel.

317
00:26:27,846 --> 00:26:31,646
If you still say you're gonna win,
then it's time to change your tune.

318
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,149
- Go! Destroy Toon World!
- No!

319
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,287
Use Cannon Firestorm.

320
00:26:51,503 --> 00:26:53,801
That's all folks.

321
00:26:54,005 --> 00:26:57,600
Now let's see which you've
got to beat the Egyptian Gods.

322
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:01,338
Looks like you had two
cards up your sleeve.

323
00:27:01,947 --> 00:27:04,415
What do you mean, two cards?

324
00:27:05,283 --> 00:27:08,377
- Kaiba, there was only one.
- Yeah, right.

325
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,354
Nice try, you snake.

326
00:27:15,527 --> 00:27:19,463
The museum is the last place those
demented duelists would think to look for you.

327
00:27:19,631 --> 00:27:21,098
Hope you're right.

328
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:24,929
Hey, it's some kind of
an Egyptian exhibit.

329
00:27:26,472 --> 00:27:27,837
Look, Téa.

330
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,372
That blue pyramid, there.

331
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:34,439
- It looks like my Millennium Puzzle.
- Yeah, it does.

332
00:27:34,647 --> 00:27:36,512
Let's go check it out.

333
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:48,393
It says: The tomb of Anubis.
Egyptian Lord of the Dead.

334
00:27:48,561 --> 00:27:51,758
If we stay here I'm
gonna blow chunks.

335
00:27:52,264 --> 00:27:55,722
Okay, I get the point, Téa.
You're not a mummy fan.

336
00:28:04,844 --> 00:28:08,280
Hey, it's my grandfather.
What are you doing here?

337
00:28:08,481 --> 00:28:10,949
Oh, well it looks like great
minds think alike.

338
00:28:11,584 --> 00:28:14,610
- So you came to see that Pyramid, too?
- Yep.

339
00:28:14,854 --> 00:28:17,322
This says, it's called
the Pyramid of Light.

340
00:28:17,556 --> 00:28:22,220
In all my years of egyptology, I've
never come across this relic before.

341
00:28:22,428 --> 00:28:27,388
But it says here it belonged to an evil sorceror
who tried to bring about the end of the world.

342
00:28:27,668 --> 00:28:30,831
Well I guess it's pretty safe to
say his plan didn't work, right?

343
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:33,370
Legends say a brave pharaoh
destroyed him using -

344
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,031
- the mystical Dagger of Fate.

345
00:28:36,276 --> 00:28:41,043
The same pharaoh who many believed
possessed your Millennium Puzzle.

346
00:28:41,281 --> 00:28:43,078
Come, I'll show you.

347
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:45,908
See? There is the knife.

348
00:28:46,153 --> 00:28:49,520
- Can we leave?
- What's it say here on his sarcophagus.

349
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:52,250
Let's see. It's some sort of prophecy.

350
00:28:52,426 --> 00:28:57,591
"The eye that sees what's yet to
come its vision shall be fulfilled -"

351
00:28:57,798 --> 00:29:00,494
"- unless blinded by events
predetermined."

352
00:29:00,734 --> 00:29:03,032
"Thus light and shadows
both be killed."

353
00:29:26,893 --> 00:29:28,827
From the light comes the dark.

354
00:29:31,898 --> 00:29:34,800
Téa? Would you read me the
story about the bunny?

355
00:29:34,969 --> 00:29:37,938
I'm gonna pretend that's the concussion
talking and forget all about it.

356
00:29:38,106 --> 00:29:39,630
'Cause right now we
got bigger problems.

357
00:29:39,907 --> 00:29:42,171
Like where King Tut's
freaky cousin went.

358
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,901
The mummy's body's been stolen.

359
00:29:45,646 --> 00:29:49,104
And that's not all. He napped
that pyramid thing too.

360
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,318
Grandpa. Stay here.

361
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,488
I have a feeling Kaiba's in
danger. I have to warn him.

362
00:29:54,689 --> 00:29:57,157
- Yugi.
- Just keep an eye on Grandpa.

363
00:29:57,358 --> 00:29:58,689
I'll call you.

364
00:29:59,527 --> 00:30:00,960
What hit me?

365
00:30:01,129 --> 00:30:03,324
Probably whatever
broke into the museum.

366
00:30:03,564 --> 00:30:05,054
No. This is terrible.

367
00:30:05,266 --> 00:30:08,360
Yeah, they took the mummy
and the Pyramid of Light.

368
00:30:08,569 --> 00:30:11,231
This is one crime those
crooks is gonna regret.

369
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:16,274
According to the legend, Anubis found
that he would one day return from the dead.

370
00:30:16,444 --> 00:30:18,309
What's going on?

371
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:22,643
- You don't really think that...
- Téa, I don't know what to think.

372
00:30:22,884 --> 00:30:26,445
Let's just hope that
legend is just a legend.

373
00:30:29,357 --> 00:30:30,824
Stop the car!

374
00:30:35,396 --> 00:30:39,060
Yugi. I've been looking all over for you.
My brother sent me to find you.

375
00:30:39,234 --> 00:30:42,670
And he says that it's real important
that you bring your Dual Disc, right away.

376
00:30:43,305 --> 00:30:46,433
- Wait, so he's okay then?
- I wouldn't say he's okay.

377
00:30:46,608 --> 00:30:50,044
All I know is that Seto hasn't
been acting like himself lately.

378
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:51,906
I think he's gonna
totally lose it.

379
00:30:54,049 --> 00:30:55,949
Way to hold back that crowd, champ.

380
00:30:56,151 --> 00:30:59,712
Or, like you helped. Then again
you duel worse than my mom.

381
00:30:59,955 --> 00:31:03,413
You're just lucky I'm worn out, man.

382
00:31:04,126 --> 00:31:07,425
Check it out. What's Kaiba's
limo doing at Yugi's place?

383
00:31:09,131 --> 00:31:11,531
Hey, Yugi, wait up. Stop!

384
00:31:13,268 --> 00:31:16,965
- Bro, I smell trouble.
- Actually that's me. Sorry about that.

385
00:31:29,718 --> 00:31:32,687
My brother's waiting
for you on the top floor.

386
00:31:32,921 --> 00:31:34,889
I got it. Thanks.

387
00:31:42,364 --> 00:31:45,391
<i>Welcome to the
Kaiba Corp. Duel Dome.</i>

388
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:50,503
<i>Destination: Skytop Dueling Platform.</i>

389
00:31:54,143 --> 00:31:56,509
This is want he wants.

390
00:31:57,647 --> 00:32:01,048
But it is too much of a coincident
that Kaiba would send for us -

391
00:32:01,251 --> 00:32:05,119
- right after the vision we had at the museum.
There must be something more going on here.

392
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:08,586
And I'm pretty sure it has something
to do with that Anubis guy.

393
00:32:08,758 --> 00:32:12,455
It seams like you had some kind of
battle with him 5000 years ago.

394
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:17,261
Perhaps. But sadly memories of my
days as the pharaoh are clouded, -

395
00:32:17,433 --> 00:32:22,234
- nor is it clear to me what role the
Egyptian God Cards have to play in all this.

396
00:32:22,438 --> 00:32:25,066
I sure wish we knew more about
what happened back in your past.

397
00:32:25,308 --> 00:32:27,936
All that matters is that we
face the future together.

398
00:32:28,177 --> 00:32:31,271
And I wouldn't have it any other
way. Are you ready partner?

399
00:32:31,447 --> 00:32:32,971
Ready.

400
00:32:33,683 --> 00:32:36,243
Yu-Gi-Oh!

401
00:32:40,924 --> 00:32:43,484
Kaiba's car is outside
so Yugi must be here.

402
00:32:43,726 --> 00:32:47,662
Wow, you're a regular Sherlock Holmes.
Did you figure that out all by yourself?

403
00:32:47,897 --> 00:32:50,992
- Hey, Yugi is upstairs.
- Hey, what's going on?

404
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:53,863
My brother is about
to duel him.

405
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,497
Welcome.

406
00:33:24,735 --> 00:33:26,566
Glad you came to duel, Yugi.

407
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:29,364
'Cause this time things
are gonna be different.

408
00:33:32,476 --> 00:33:35,445
<i>Initiating duel simulation.</i>

409
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:39,776
<i>Calculating player strength.
God Cards destroyed.</i>

410
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:04,138
I hope you've brought
your Egyptian God Cards.

411
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:06,709
Otherwise, this duel isn't
gonna be any fun at all.

412
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:11,882
Kaiba, I'm sensing the present of something far
more dangerous than you can possibly imagine.

413
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,074
<i>Spare me the fairy tales.</i>

414
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:17,515
- We could all be in great danger.
- I've heard enough.

415
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:20,884
If you think you sense something
dangerous, you're absolutely right, -

416
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,993
- because it's me and my deck,
and in this Duel Monsters match -

417
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:25,993
- you're about to lose big-time.

418
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:28,428
Mokuba, seal all of the exits.

419
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,463
If you say so.

420
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,832
- What's the deal?
- We're trapped, man.

421
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,205
Now what'd you say we get
down to business, already?

422
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,372
Something tells me that this
duel is not a good idea.

423
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:50,384
Kaiba, why don't you stop thinking about yourself
for once and listen to what I'm telling you?

424
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,823
You're in no position to
be making demands.

425
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:56,584
So shut up and duel.

426
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:59,797
And may the best duelist win.

427
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:04,899
- I guess Yugi's going through with this.
- Kaiba ain't leaving him much choice.

428
00:35:06,906 --> 00:35:11,138
All duel dome exits are now secured.
All dueling systems are online.

429
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:14,858
You've been taking credit for being
the best duelist for way too long.

430
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:16,910
And to tell you the
truth I'm sick of it.

431
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:22,951
By the time this duel is over, you'll be
exposed to the world as a total fraud.

432
00:35:24,924 --> 00:35:25,913
Let's duel!

433
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:27,284
I'll start.

434
00:35:32,865 --> 00:35:37,825
First I'll summon my Familiar Knight in
defence mode. Try and get past him.

435
00:35:38,037 --> 00:35:40,972
Very well, I shall.

436
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:46,644
I play Queen's Knight.

437
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:51,182
And now, say goodbye
to your monster.

438
00:35:52,852 --> 00:35:55,150
Queen's Knight, attack!

439
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:05,527
By destroying your knight,
I've activated it's speciel ability -

440
00:36:05,698 --> 00:36:08,634
- which allows you to play
a new beast in it's place.

441
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:12,430
What? Yugi's lost it. Why would
he let Kaiba play a monster -

442
00:36:12,431 --> 00:36:15,506
- with 2400 attack points?
- He did what?

443
00:36:16,076 --> 00:36:19,842
And you're being so
helpful, because why? 

444
00:36:20,046 --> 00:36:23,345
Because by doing so I also get
to summon a new monster.

445
00:36:23,817 --> 00:36:25,682
King's Knight.

446
00:36:27,988 --> 00:36:30,456
And these two knights
are in play I can -

447
00:36:30,657 --> 00:36:33,558
- automatically summon
my Jack's Knight.

448
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:39,396
And next I place one card face down.

449
00:36:39,766 --> 00:36:41,631
Make your move.

450
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:50,209
Looks like your luck's finally run out.
I'll keep this card face down on the field -

451
00:36:50,443 --> 00:36:53,776
- until the time is right.
Right for me that is.

452
00:36:53,947 --> 00:36:58,247
And then nothing in your deck will
make a difference. Your move, Yugi.

453
00:37:05,258 --> 00:37:07,692
An Egyptian God Card.

454
00:37:08,995 --> 00:37:13,933
I sacrifice my three knights to
bring forth my ultimate creature.

455
00:37:16,003 --> 00:37:19,200
Behold the Egyptian God Card:

456
00:37:19,407 --> 00:37:23,002
Slifer the Sky Dragon.

457
00:37:33,387 --> 00:37:37,118
Your monster is completely defenceless
against the devine power of Slifer.

458
00:37:37,425 --> 00:37:40,861
Now my Sky Dragon. Attack!

459
00:37:48,302 --> 00:37:50,293
Had enough?

460
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,467
Not only am I not afraid
of your God Cards -

461
00:37:54,675 --> 00:37:57,940
- but I'm gonna force you to
summon all three of them at once.

462
00:37:59,947 --> 00:38:02,313
Thanks to my Obligatory
Summon Magic Card -

463
00:38:02,516 --> 00:38:05,246
- you have to bring out every monster
in your deck that falls into -

464
00:38:05,419 --> 00:38:08,479
- the same category as the one
that's on the field already.

465
00:38:08,723 --> 00:38:12,318
Very well. Then I play
two more God Cards.

466
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,758
Obelisk the Tormentor and
The Winged Dragon of Ra.

467
00:38:37,686 --> 00:38:41,782
You've allowed me to assemble the three strongest
and most feared creatures in Duel Monsters, -

468
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,959
- Kaiba. A foolish mistake.

469
00:38:47,629 --> 00:38:49,062
It's no mistake.

470
00:38:49,231 --> 00:38:53,668
My entire strategy was to draw out
your three Egyptian God Cards, -

471
00:38:53,902 --> 00:38:57,668
- so I can be the first duelist
to crush all of them at once.

472
00:38:57,873 --> 00:39:02,572
- And just how do you attend to do that?
- You're about to find out right now.

473
00:39:02,778 --> 00:39:06,179
Reveal Trap Card.
Pyramid of Light.

474
00:39:07,816 --> 00:39:11,752
<i>So the Pyramid of Light is more
than just an ancient artifact.</i>

475
00:39:12,387 --> 00:39:14,617
<i>It's also a card.</i>

476
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:17,682
Now pyramid, activate!

477
00:39:46,522 --> 00:39:50,788
Looks like your so called unstoppable
monsters have been stopped.

478
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,789
Impossible.

479
00:39:53,062 --> 00:39:55,428
See for yourself.

480
00:39:56,566 --> 00:39:59,057
Wow, check it out.

481
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:08,071
- Your monsters are useless.
- But how?

482
00:40:10,813 --> 00:40:13,111
He actually did it.

483
00:40:18,287 --> 00:40:21,051
Yugi. What's this?

484
00:40:27,864 --> 00:40:30,389
Oh, man, not more freaky magic.

485
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:33,830
This weird stuff always
happens when Yugi duels.

486
00:40:34,037 --> 00:40:38,633
- Hey, what're you looking at?
- I think you got it mad.

487
00:40:39,676 --> 00:40:43,840
- Just hang on, man.
- Easier said than done, Joey.

488
00:40:48,285 --> 00:40:50,276
What's going on?

489
00:40:57,928 --> 00:40:59,395
This is crazy.

490
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,014
It's Kaiba's Duel Dome.

491
00:41:24,288 --> 00:41:27,883
That blue beam is the same color of
the Pyramid of Light from the museum -

492
00:41:28,091 --> 00:41:29,922
- and I bet it's no coincidence.

493
00:41:30,093 --> 00:41:34,189
What ever is going on in there, one
thing's for sure: It can't be good.

494
00:41:34,698 --> 00:41:37,031
Yugi, where are you?

495
00:41:37,969 --> 00:41:42,030
Kaiba, do you have any idea
what you've just done?

496
00:41:42,207 --> 00:41:45,142
Well, let's see. I think I
have just beaten you.

497
00:42:00,158 --> 00:42:03,821
Hey, wait a sec. This place
looks kinda familiar.

498
00:42:04,028 --> 00:42:07,896
This is where the pharaoh's spirit lives.
Inside the Millennium Puzzle.

499
00:42:08,066 --> 00:42:10,364
I've gotta find it so
we can reconnect.

500
00:42:12,604 --> 00:42:15,732
I'm pretty sure that one of
these rooms belongs to him.

501
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:20,877
Question is, which one? There must
be a million doorways in this place.

502
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:28,618
Oh, man I feel as bad
as you look, Joey.

503
00:42:31,389 --> 00:42:34,722
Tristan. I don't think we're
in Kansas anymore.

504
00:42:34,893 --> 00:42:40,354
It looks like some weird maze. And man,
I think you and I are the lab rats. 

505
00:42:40,598 --> 00:42:44,968
Hello? Hello? Pharaoh?

506
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,932
Pharaoh, are you here?

507
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,235
Pharaoh?

508
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:55,169
Nothing.

509
00:42:55,514 --> 00:42:59,974
Pharaoh!

510
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:05,151
- You hear that?
- Yeah, it sounded like Yugi. Come on.

511
00:43:15,334 --> 00:43:20,135
It hurts doesn't it? When you put your
faith in the Gods and they let you down.

512
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:24,002
If I were you now is a good time
to start praying for mercy.

513
00:43:24,176 --> 00:43:28,306
Because from here on out, I'm planning
to take you apart piece by painful piece.

514
00:43:28,514 --> 00:43:30,914
So let the torture continue with this:

515
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:33,984
The torrential magic of
Mystical Space Typhoon.

516
00:43:34,353 --> 00:43:37,322
Your face down card is destroyed.

517
00:43:37,957 --> 00:43:40,585
And if you like that, then
you're gonna love this:

518
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,794
Peten the Dark Clown.

519
00:43:43,195 --> 00:43:46,790
But don't let his name fool you.
He's no laughing matter.

520
00:43:49,903 --> 00:43:53,464
Now, attack with Bloodlust Slash.

521
00:44:00,714 --> 00:44:04,514
And to top it off I'll place
this face down on the field.

522
00:44:04,951 --> 00:44:10,480
That attack it drained me some.
But I'm far from finished.

523
00:44:10,724 --> 00:44:16,663
Magician's Valkyria, attack!
Mystic Sceptre Blast.

524
00:44:25,405 --> 00:44:28,203
Nice try, Yugi, but I knew
you'd make that move, -

525
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:32,778
- which is why my face down card
is Deck Destruction Virus.

526
00:44:33,747 --> 00:44:37,239
You set off this cribleling trap when
you destroyed my Dark Clown, -

527
00:44:37,484 --> 00:44:41,215
- and now it's viral tentacles will infect
ten random cards from your deck -

528
00:44:41,388 --> 00:44:44,789
- and send them straight to the graveyard.
- Oh, no.

529
00:44:45,025 --> 00:44:50,053
Oh, yes, Yugi. Now say goodbye
to 25 percent of your Duel Deck.

530
00:44:57,171 --> 00:44:58,536
No.

531
00:44:58,706 --> 00:45:01,504
I hate to be the bearer
of even more bad news, -

532
00:45:01,676 --> 00:45:04,008
- but when you destroyed
my Peten the Dark Clown, -

533
00:45:04,178 --> 00:45:07,477
- you activated his special ability,
allowing me to summon another -

534
00:45:07,682 --> 00:45:10,207
- Dark Clown to take his place.

535
00:45:21,395 --> 00:45:24,694
I summon Des Feral Imp.

536
00:45:24,932 --> 00:45:28,333
And next I'll activate the
magical Card of Demise.

537
00:45:28,536 --> 00:45:31,096
It let's me draw five new
cards from my deck.

538
00:45:31,338 --> 00:45:35,297
But if I don't use them in five turns,
I lose them in five turns.

539
00:45:35,576 --> 00:45:40,536
Now I'll sacrifice my Feral Imp and
activate White Dragon Ritual -

540
00:45:41,048 --> 00:45:44,074
- to summon Paladin of White Dragon.

541
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:47,913
Paladin, attack with
Bionic Spear Burst.

542
00:45:59,534 --> 00:46:04,471
When I lose my life points I'm
losing my actual life energy.

543
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:09,276
And now, I summon
Blue-Eyes White Dragon.

544
00:46:11,313 --> 00:46:12,905
Take a good look.

545
00:46:13,081 --> 00:46:16,278
It's the monster that's been the bane
of your dueling existence ever since -

546
00:46:16,485 --> 00:46:19,147
- our first match. And now he's back.

547
00:46:19,755 --> 00:46:21,655
But he's not alone.

548
00:46:21,857 --> 00:46:24,655
Any last requests?

549
00:46:34,169 --> 00:46:36,137
There he is. Hey, Pharaoh!

550
00:46:38,707 --> 00:46:40,140
Where did he go?

551
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:47,676
Hey, hold on!

552
00:46:48,683 --> 00:46:50,844
This isn't his room.

553
00:46:58,226 --> 00:47:00,786
Pharaoh. Oh, no.

554
00:47:04,466 --> 00:47:06,367
Who's there?

555
00:47:32,829 --> 00:47:36,060
- Yugi, you in here?
- Yugi?

556
00:47:39,368 --> 00:47:40,835
Hi.

557
00:47:42,104 --> 00:47:45,665
- Talk later. Run now.
- What's with him?

558
00:47:56,185 --> 00:47:59,245
Woaw, it looks like an
earthquake hit this place.

559
00:48:01,257 --> 00:48:05,387
- And what in the world is that thing?
- That's what I wanna know.

560
00:48:05,995 --> 00:48:09,055
Mokuba. Is Yugi inside that thing?

561
00:48:09,265 --> 00:48:11,860
He's in there and so is my brother.

562
00:48:13,437 --> 00:48:16,873
- What is it?
- I don't know.

563
00:48:17,074 --> 00:48:21,977
Looks like that artifact we saw back at
the museum, only this one's super-sized.

564
00:48:22,179 --> 00:48:25,478
- But how is something like that possible?
- Anubis.

565
00:48:25,682 --> 00:48:29,641
- You don't think?
- Don't you remember the legend?

566
00:48:29,887 --> 00:48:34,449
Anubis once tried to destroy the world
using the power of the Pyramid of Light.

567
00:48:34,691 --> 00:48:37,888
The Pyramid of Light?
Wait, rewind a sec.

568
00:48:38,095 --> 00:48:41,189
All of this insanity started when
my brother played a card that -

569
00:48:41,398 --> 00:48:45,027
- was called the Pyramid of Light.
- Well, Yugi and Kaiba are inside something -

570
00:48:45,269 --> 00:48:47,294
- from 5000 years ago.

571
00:48:47,537 --> 00:48:52,600
And if the myth is true then Anubis is
using it to finish was he started in the past.

572
00:48:52,843 --> 00:48:56,335
This is crazy. We gotta get
them out of there.

573
00:48:57,748 --> 00:49:00,273
I don't know what dark
powers are at work here -

574
00:49:00,484 --> 00:49:02,577
- but I can't let them go unchecked.

575
00:49:02,786 --> 00:49:06,688
I play Premature Burial to raise
Valkyria from the graveyard -

576
00:49:06,857 --> 00:49:10,088
- and I'll boost her strength
with Mage Power.

577
00:49:11,929 --> 00:49:14,659
It may cost me 800 life points, -

578
00:49:18,102 --> 00:49:22,095
- but my Valkyria now gains 500
attack and defence points

579
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:26,970
- everytime I play a Magic or
Trap Card. Like these two.

580
00:49:31,115 --> 00:49:34,312
1000 additional attack
points make my Valkyria -

581
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:38,011
- more than a match for your
Blue-Eyes. Attack, Valkyria, -

582
00:49:38,289 --> 00:49:41,349
- with Mystic Sceptre Blast.

583
00:49:43,661 --> 00:49:49,258
Not so fast, Yugi. Attack Guidance
Armor will save my Blue-Eyes.

584
00:49:53,404 --> 00:49:55,668
- A trap.
- Very observant.

585
00:49:55,873 --> 00:49:58,740
Now your attack is diverted.

586
00:49:59,877 --> 00:50:02,744
And since my Deck Destruction
Virus is still in play -

587
00:50:02,914 --> 00:50:05,712
- it infects ten more
cards in your deck.

588
00:50:13,691 --> 00:50:16,558
I've lost half the cards
in my deck already.

589
00:50:17,128 --> 00:50:20,689
Soon you'll lose them all. But first
I'll bring back an old friend -

590
00:50:20,898 --> 00:50:23,129
- who just hates to say goodbye.

591
00:50:27,573 --> 00:50:29,564
And next... -

592
00:50:30,676 --> 00:50:33,167
- I'm gonna summon up
your worst nightmare.

593
00:50:33,412 --> 00:50:36,609
Because if you couldn't
defeat one Blue-Eyes... -

594
00:50:38,017 --> 00:50:40,884
- there's no way you'll
defeat three, -

595
00:50:41,086 --> 00:50:46,718
- especially when combined as
the Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.

596
00:50:47,126 --> 00:50:52,120
If you think he's scary now, just wait
till he attacks. In fact don't wait.

597
00:50:52,765 --> 00:50:56,531
Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.
Neutron Blast.

598
00:51:11,083 --> 00:51:14,211
Look at the world's
best duelist now.

599
00:51:17,122 --> 00:51:20,489
- Think we've lost them.
- So what, what are those freaks?

600
00:51:23,762 --> 00:51:25,992
Yugi, what the heck is going on?

601
00:51:26,265 --> 00:51:28,734
We've been drawn into
the Millennium Puzzle -

602
00:51:28,935 --> 00:51:30,903
- and that thing up there is
somehow responsible.

603
00:51:31,371 --> 00:51:33,396
Then what's that, down there?

604
00:51:34,307 --> 00:51:37,902
That blue one looks like the Pyramid
of Light I saw at the museum.

605
00:51:38,445 --> 00:51:42,541
Yeah? Well it looks like it's beating the
crap out of your Millennium Puzzle.

606
00:51:42,749 --> 00:51:45,809
Fighting pyramides and creepy
floating eyes. Wonderful.

607
00:51:46,052 --> 00:51:49,044
- It's crazy.
- Hey. When you around with Yugi -

608
00:51:49,255 --> 00:51:53,589
- it's a path full of coarse.
- So, any idea what we're up against?

609
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,551
Maybe.

610
00:51:56,329 --> 00:52:00,060
I think this all has to do with
an ancient Egyptian sorceror.

611
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,393
I knew it was gonna
be something insane.

612
00:52:02,635 --> 00:52:05,729
He's called Anubis the
Egyptian Lord of the Dead.

613
00:52:05,972 --> 00:52:07,701
- Lord of the Dead?
- Yeah.

614
00:52:07,941 --> 00:52:11,377
Centuries ago he tried to destroy
the world and I'm starting to believe -

615
00:52:11,611 --> 00:52:14,079
- he's trying to make a comeback.
- What?

616
00:52:14,247 --> 00:52:18,980
<i>The eye that sees what's yet
to come its vision shall be fulfilled -</i>

617
00:52:19,252 --> 00:52:22,153
<i>- unless blinded by events
predetermined.</i>

618
00:52:22,322 --> 00:52:24,552
<i>Thus light and shadows
both be killed.</i>

619
00:52:28,828 --> 00:52:31,922
Doesn't look like the duel's going too
well for your friend the pharaoh.

620
00:52:32,132 --> 00:52:35,762
Yeah, we got to do something to help him.
And all I can think of right now is -

621
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:38,191
- to head back to Anubis' tomb.

622
00:52:38,192 --> 00:52:41,908
- You mean back towards the mummies?
- Hey, come on. We already know -

623
00:52:42,109 --> 00:52:43,667
- we can outrun them.

624
00:52:54,522 --> 00:52:58,253
Does it hurt Yugi? Because it
only gets worse from here.

625
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:03,362
Kaiba, we can't continue this Duel.
There's another power at work here, -

626
00:53:03,531 --> 00:53:06,694
- and it's destroying us both.
- That's getting a bit old.

627
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:10,631
No. That Pyramid of Light has
created a deadly Shadow Game.

628
00:53:10,804 --> 00:53:14,035
I know you sense it we must stop now.

629
00:53:14,341 --> 00:53:17,252
The only thing I sense is your
fear. Not that I blame you.

630
00:53:17,253 --> 00:53:20,670
But I came here to win and
stopping's not an option.

631
00:53:20,981 --> 00:53:25,975
For all the times you humiliated me in a duel,
when clearly I should have been champion.

632
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:30,520
For all the times I'd had to listen to your
preach about the heart of the cards.

633
00:53:30,758 --> 00:53:35,661
You're going down, Yugi. And my Blue-Eyes
Ultimate Dragon is gonna put you there.

634
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:41,835
Kaiba, once again your ridiculously
over-inflated ego blinds you to the truth.

635
00:53:42,037 --> 00:53:46,474
I am far from beaten.
I play Monster Reborn.

636
00:53:47,142 --> 00:53:50,873
To bring back Dark Magician Girl.

637
00:53:56,851 --> 00:54:01,083
Next I reveal my face
down card, Sage's Stone.

638
00:54:01,256 --> 00:54:05,215
When Dark Magician Girl is on the
field and Sage's Stone is played, -

639
00:54:05,427 --> 00:54:08,521
- it allows me to automatically
summon Dark Magician.

640
00:54:10,799 --> 00:54:13,768
- Big deal.
- Oh, it's a very big deal.

641
00:54:14,035 --> 00:54:16,833
For now I sacrifice both magicians -

642
00:54:17,005 --> 00:54:20,600
- to summon the
Sorceror of Dark Magic.

643
00:54:23,945 --> 00:54:28,382
And with his rise to power comes
your Blue-Eyes far from grace.

644
00:54:28,617 --> 00:54:32,246
Because for everyone of my sorceror's
fallen comrades in the graveyard -

645
00:54:32,454 --> 00:54:35,685
- your dragon loses 500 points.

646
00:54:36,491 --> 00:54:40,723
And right now there have been
three magicians laid down to rest, -

647
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:47,324
- so your precious Ultimate Dragon's
power decreases by 1500 points.

648
00:54:48,738 --> 00:54:52,765
But that means my Blue-Eyes Ultimate
Dragon is vulnerable to attack.

649
00:54:53,042 --> 00:54:58,446
That's exactly what it means.
Attack with Celestial Blast.

650
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:09,615
Now, will you stop this madness?

651
00:55:09,859 --> 00:55:12,350
After one lucky move?
I don't think so.

652
00:55:14,196 --> 00:55:19,896
Very well, Kaiba you leave me no choice.
I move to attack Peten the Dark Clown.

653
00:55:20,102 --> 00:55:24,539
No, I'll have no monsters on the
field to defend my life points.

654
00:55:24,774 --> 00:55:29,211
Sorcerer, Celestial Blast attack!

655
00:55:33,549 --> 00:55:35,346
You may have destroyed my
clown, but you forgot about - 

656
00:55:35,551 --> 00:55:38,452
- Deck Virus Trap Card.

657
00:55:38,688 --> 00:55:44,251
And at a time when you couldn't afford to.
Your deck's about to be wiped out. 

658
00:55:46,595 --> 00:55:48,563
- What?
- Sorry, Kaiba...

659
00:55:48,731 --> 00:55:51,963
But my Sorceror of Dark Magic
mystic's powers are so mighty, -

660
00:55:52,169 --> 00:55:56,162
- he can stop the activation of Trap Cards,
like your Deck Virus and destroy it.

661
00:55:56,406 --> 00:56:00,433
- My deck is safe.
- But your life points aren't.

662
00:56:05,349 --> 00:56:08,841
I activate the magic of
Monster Reborn.

663
00:56:09,553 --> 00:56:13,819
Then I sacrifice my reborned Ultimate
Dragon to summon a new monster.

664
00:56:14,057 --> 00:56:15,524
- What?
- That's right.

665
00:56:15,759 --> 00:56:20,822
You see I have an even more powerful
monster, compliments of Pegasus.

666
00:56:21,031 --> 00:56:26,765
A shiny new dragon.
The Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon.

667
00:56:43,286 --> 00:56:46,585
Could it be? A card I'd
never seen before?

668
00:56:46,757 --> 00:56:48,987
And for every dragon in my graveyard -

669
00:56:49,226 --> 00:56:53,925
- the Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon gains
an additional 300 attack points.

670
00:56:54,464 --> 00:56:58,094
That's an extra 1500 attack points, -

671
00:56:58,302 --> 00:57:01,567
- for at punishing grand
total of 4500 points.

672
00:57:05,476 --> 00:57:08,639
But don't forget, due to
my sorceres' powers, -

673
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,748
- your new dragon's attack
points decrease by 1500.

674
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:17,717
I don't think so. Thanks to my
dragon's Shining Diffusion.

675
00:57:19,791 --> 00:57:21,588
What, your points didn't decrease.

676
00:57:21,793 --> 00:57:26,253
Exactly. That's because my Blue-Eyes Shining
Dragon allows me to choose which Magic Trap -

677
00:57:26,664 --> 00:57:29,827
- or Monster Effect Cards
can be used against him.

678
00:57:30,301 --> 00:57:33,737
Just face it, Yugi, your days as
a champion duelist are over.

679
00:57:33,938 --> 00:57:37,339
My Shining Dragon is gonna blast
you back to the minor leagues -

680
00:57:37,508 --> 00:57:38,839
- where you belong.

681
00:57:39,076 --> 00:57:43,979
Now, hit him again, Blue-Eyes.
Shining Neutron Blast.

682
00:57:59,664 --> 00:58:05,604
How do you like it? The pain, the
sting of defeat. I felt it for too long.

683
00:58:08,307 --> 00:58:10,070
Now it's your turn.

684
00:58:16,081 --> 00:58:18,379
You're sure this is the
way to that mummy guy?

685
00:58:18,584 --> 00:58:21,519
Yeah, every hallway
looks the same.

686
00:58:22,321 --> 00:58:24,516
- Hey, what's wrong, Yugi?
- It's weird.

687
00:58:24,723 --> 00:58:26,691
Suddenly I feel really weak, guys.

688
00:58:28,927 --> 00:58:32,226
Check it out. It's some
kind of energy stream.

689
00:58:32,731 --> 00:58:36,326
Maybe if we follow this thing,
it'll lead us to Anubis.

690
00:58:36,568 --> 00:58:39,401
Sounds like a plan, come on, pal.

691
00:58:49,515 --> 00:58:54,009
It's putting out energy waves that
are making my pacemaker go haywire. 

692
00:59:14,374 --> 00:59:15,864
Up here!

693
00:59:18,878 --> 00:59:21,847
- I'd hurry up.
- Pegasus?

694
00:59:34,761 --> 00:59:36,820
Pegasus, what are you doing here?

695
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:39,999
How about we start with a
thank you, you little ingrate?

696
00:59:40,166 --> 00:59:44,500
If I hadn't figured out what this whole Pyramid
of Light things about, you'd all be crushed.

697
00:59:44,737 --> 00:59:48,867
You see, Kaiba thinks he got that card from me
when in fact this is all been arranged by an -

698
00:59:49,042 --> 00:59:52,739
- evil lord who tried to take over the
world five millennia ago and is now back -

699
00:59:52,979 --> 00:59:55,470
- to finish the job. I looked it up.

700
00:59:55,782 --> 00:59:59,218
Now, this Anubis has created
the ultimate Shadow Game -

701
00:59:59,419 --> 01:00:03,515
- and he's getting stronger every moment.
- Then the prophecy is being fulfilled.

702
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:06,918
And Yugi and Kaiba are
right in the middle of it.

703
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,651
We just gotta find a
way to help them.

704
01:00:14,134 --> 01:00:16,830
- Looks like this is it.
- Yeah.

705
01:00:37,691 --> 01:00:42,390
<i>Foolish mortals there is nothing
you can do to stop my rebirth.</i>

706
01:00:42,563 --> 01:00:48,001
<i>I have infiltrated the realm of the
pharaoh and his life force now feeds mine.</i>

707
01:00:48,202 --> 01:00:52,161
We won't stand here while you suck
the life out of others to save yourself.

708
01:00:52,373 --> 01:00:56,673
- We're gonna take you down, Anubis.
- I'd stay in that casket if I were you.

709
01:00:56,877 --> 01:01:00,506
Yeah, because just in case you haven't
noticed, we've got you outnumbered.

710
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:12,488
This place is crawling with stiffs.

711
01:01:16,864 --> 01:01:18,331
What do you want, anyway?

712
01:01:18,532 --> 01:01:23,994
<i>Behold the future since you won't
live to see it for yourself.</i>

713
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:31,701
<i>Soon my beasts of destruction shall
annihilate all traces of life on Earth.</i>

714
01:01:31,913 --> 01:01:37,249
<i>And I will finally complete that
which I started millennia ago.</i>

715
01:01:39,954 --> 01:01:45,449
<i>It is by your very hand that this
devastation will occur, mortal.</i>

716
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:50,290
<i>For when you released the
pharaoh, you released me as well.</i>

717
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:51,829
What's he mean?

718
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,831
This is between me and him.

719
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:57,563
Listen, you guys need to find a way
outta this place and save yourselves.

720
01:01:57,772 --> 01:02:01,003
- I'm gonna stay here and figure this out.
- Figure what out?

721
01:02:01,209 --> 01:02:04,042
There was a prophecy my grandpa
read to me in the museum.

722
01:02:04,245 --> 01:02:08,113
And I think it may have something to
do with this. I just don't know what.

723
01:02:08,316 --> 01:02:09,613
Yugi, that's crazy.

724
01:02:09,918 --> 01:02:11,044
Just go guys.

725
01:02:11,286 --> 01:02:14,551
Wait there's no way we're
leaving you, we're team.

726
01:02:14,723 --> 01:02:18,819
We've been through everything together and
there's no chance we're turning our back on you now.

727
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:21,119
- That's right.
- But...

728
01:02:21,329 --> 01:02:25,061
The last thing I wanna do is
put my best friends in danger.

729
01:02:28,738 --> 01:02:32,799
What are you doing? Téa, please,
get down from there.

730
01:02:33,008 --> 01:02:35,772
My friends need me. I just know it.

731
01:02:38,981 --> 01:02:40,448
Foolish girl.

732
01:02:42,752 --> 01:02:45,744
Téa, come back in here at once.

733
01:02:46,222 --> 01:02:48,690
I've got to help my friends.

734
01:02:49,024 --> 01:02:51,424
- She's falling.
- Grab her.

735
01:03:05,508 --> 01:03:09,035
I'm coming, guys!

736
01:03:10,646 --> 01:03:13,114
- Téa.
- How did you find us?

737
01:03:13,315 --> 01:03:17,115
Are you kidding me? Remember
the friendship symbol we drew?

738
01:03:17,353 --> 01:03:20,322
- Of course we do.
- The ink may have fated but our -

739
01:03:20,523 --> 01:03:22,923
- bond never will.
- Right.

740
01:03:23,159 --> 01:03:27,493
We're all with you. And we're
always be with you.

741
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:31,200
Thanks, guys. Friends till the end.

742
01:03:31,401 --> 01:03:32,868
- Yeah.
- Right.

743
01:03:33,737 --> 01:03:37,730
You see? There's nothing out there that's
more powerful than our friendship.

744
01:03:38,008 --> 01:03:42,206
Téa is right. I can feel it. All we
have to do is stick together.

745
01:03:42,445 --> 01:03:44,845
Hey, stick it together,
is what we do best.

746
01:03:45,081 --> 01:03:47,049
We'll never leave your side.

747
01:03:47,884 --> 01:03:50,751
- Téa.
<i>- Your pathetic little bond -</i></i>

748
01:03:50,921 --> 01:03:53,082
<i>- is nothing against my power.</i>

749
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:58,956
<i>Soon my soul will be fully restored
and your world shrouded in darkness.</i>

750
01:03:59,196 --> 01:04:02,495
<i>Yet, you fools prate along
about togetherness?</i>

751
01:04:02,999 --> 01:04:07,026
<i>- Then so be it.</i>
- Téa!</i>

752
01:04:10,507 --> 01:04:12,907
- Téa!
- What's out!

753
01:04:18,148 --> 01:04:20,013
What? I can do that.

754
01:04:27,257 --> 01:04:30,226
- Let's take them apart.
- Literally.

755
01:04:30,427 --> 01:04:34,261
- Excuse me.
- Hey, Johnny Rotten. Over here.

756
01:04:34,431 --> 01:04:35,898
Take this.

757
01:04:40,605 --> 01:04:42,732
That wasn't suppose to happen.

758
01:04:43,274 --> 01:04:46,402
- Tristan.
- Kicks to the stomach don't work.

759
01:04:46,611 --> 01:04:48,579
 Neither do kicks to the head.

760
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,912
Let's try this.

761
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:54,674
These carcasses won't quit.

762
01:04:54,952 --> 01:04:57,716
How do you destroy
what's already dead?

763
01:05:00,258 --> 01:05:03,193
It's no use. They just keep coming.

764
01:05:12,536 --> 01:05:14,595
How the mighty has fallen.

765
01:05:14,805 --> 01:05:18,605
Lying there on the ground like a dog
waiting to be put out of it's misery.

766
01:05:18,809 --> 01:05:22,973
Get up, get up so I can
knock you back down.

767
01:05:24,615 --> 01:05:27,812
Something's not right here,
Kaiba, and you know it.

768
01:05:28,052 --> 01:05:31,112
Spare me the mystic mumbojumbo.
You just can't stand that your -

769
01:05:31,355 --> 01:05:36,315
- reputation's at stake.
- You have no idea what's at stake here.

770
01:05:36,961 --> 01:05:40,692
But believe me, I cannot
let you win this duel.

771
01:05:42,734 --> 01:05:45,726
Big Shield Gardna. Defence mode.

772
01:05:46,004 --> 01:05:50,304
You know I think you're the one who doesn't
have clue what this match is really about.

773
01:05:50,509 --> 01:05:52,500
It's about pay back.

774
01:05:55,714 --> 01:05:58,046
And this card will see to that.

775
01:06:00,886 --> 01:06:04,413
But first let's deal with your
so-called Big Shield Gardna.

776
01:06:04,656 --> 01:06:07,657
Do you think it's big enough
to block the power of -

777
01:06:07,658 --> 01:06:10,718
-  Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon?

778
01:06:14,533 --> 01:06:18,264
Hey, look. Joey and Tristan.
We gotta get down there.

779
01:06:19,171 --> 01:06:23,437
Shining Dragon attack with
Shining Neutron Blast.

780
01:06:33,885 --> 01:06:36,012
I told you when we started this duel -

781
01:06:36,221 --> 01:06:38,781
- that this time things were
gonna be different, Yugi.

782
01:06:39,024 --> 01:06:41,322
You may have beaten
me in the past, -

783
01:06:41,493 --> 01:06:45,429
- but now there's nothing you can do
to stop me from having my revenge.

784
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:47,393
You're finished.

785
01:06:47,766 --> 01:06:49,735
Not yet. I'm not.

786
01:06:51,704 --> 01:06:55,834
I activate Pot of Greed which
let's me draw two cards.

787
01:07:00,179 --> 01:07:02,477
Now I summon Watapon
in defense mode.

788
01:07:02,715 --> 01:07:05,377
And since I used Pot of
Greed to play Watapon -

789
01:07:05,618 --> 01:07:08,143
- I can summon another
monster to the field.

790
01:07:08,388 --> 01:07:12,518
And I choose Obnoxious Celtic
Guardian. It's your move.

791
01:07:12,759 --> 01:07:15,057
So let me see if I've
got this right, now.

792
01:07:15,261 --> 01:07:18,025
Your playing a cream puff and an elf.

793
01:07:18,264 --> 01:07:20,391
Well, then it's your funeral.

794
01:07:20,633 --> 01:07:25,434
First the Card of Demise I played before
sends this dragon to the graveyard.

795
01:07:25,638 --> 01:07:28,038
And I know you know what
that means, don't you?

796
01:07:28,207 --> 01:07:32,200
Now my Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon has
more destructive power than ever before.

797
01:07:32,412 --> 01:07:34,380
Kaiba, please listen to me.

798
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:38,914
All I wanna hear from you is
your anguished cry of defeat.

799
01:07:39,619 --> 01:07:43,680
Kaiba, for the last time,
I'm begging you to stop this.

800
01:07:44,257 --> 01:07:47,226
People are getting hurt,
lives are in danger.

801
01:07:47,427 --> 01:07:51,659
And this Pyramid of Light you've
created is source of it all.

802
01:07:52,098 --> 01:07:55,000
There's a dark power in our
midst and you can't deny it.

803
01:07:55,169 --> 01:07:59,606
With every life point lost, we both
become weaker. I know you can feel it.

804
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,209
We must stop. Before it's too late.

805
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:07,244
<i>Ridiculous. I can attack Yugi 
now with my Shining Dragon -</i>

806
01:08:07,414 --> 01:08:09,848
<i>- and destroy the rest
of his life points.</i>

807
01:08:10,017 --> 01:08:12,417
<i>No, I should stick to
my original strategy -</i>

808
01:08:12,619 --> 01:08:15,816
<i>- and defeat Yugi with his
very own Egyptian God Cards.</i>

809
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:19,059
I'm afraid that for you
it's already too late, Yugi.

810
01:08:19,326 --> 01:08:23,888
No, Kaiba. Please you mustn't do this
we still have time to stop this madness.

811
01:08:24,098 --> 01:08:26,396
All we have to do is end this duel.

812
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:31,469
You know, Yugi, you're absolutely right.
Stopping the duel is exactly what I'm gonna do.

813
01:08:31,672 --> 01:08:35,540
Now, Shining Blue-Eyes activate
your final special ability.

814
01:08:35,776 --> 01:08:39,507
No, you're playing with forces
you can't possibly understand.

815
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:41,771
<i>Finish him. Finish him, now!</i>

816
01:08:41,982 --> 01:08:45,076
<i>No, I wanted a perfect victory,
and with this card I can -</i>

817
01:08:45,319 --> 01:08:48,755
<i>- use Yugi's own most
powerful monsters against him.</i>

818
01:08:49,022 --> 01:08:51,786
I use Shining Nova.

819
01:08:51,992 --> 01:08:55,325
It puts the rage of 1000 Blue-Eyes
into a blast so strong it -

820
01:08:55,496 --> 01:08:58,329
- destroys itself plus
anything I choose.

821
01:08:58,565 --> 01:09:02,002
And the card that will feel the wrath
of my Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon -

822
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:03,637
- is the Pyramid of Light.

823
01:09:03,838 --> 01:09:06,363
<i>No, I need the pyramid
to destroy the pharaoh.</i>

824
01:09:06,574 --> 01:09:10,908
<i>What am I saying? I must destroy
it to gain control of Yugi's God Cards.</i>

825
01:09:11,813 --> 01:09:14,281
Your reign as the King
of Games is over.

826
01:09:14,449 --> 01:09:19,079
That title will be mine as will all
three of your Egyptian God Cards.

827
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:22,118
Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon
sacrifice yourself -

828
01:09:22,323 --> 01:09:24,814
- and destroy the Pyramid of Light.

829
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:41,740
<i>This I cannot allow.</i>

830
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:44,501
What? The Pyramid of Light
wasn't destroyed?

831
01:09:44,746 --> 01:09:50,878
<i>The Pyramid of Light endures because
I will it, so great is my power.</i>

832
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:54,145
Hey, what is this? Show yourself,
whoever you are.

833
01:09:54,422 --> 01:09:58,688
<i>I have been here the whole time,
mortal, whispering in your ear.</i>

834
01:09:58,927 --> 01:10:02,226
The whole time? No.
This is some sort of trick.

835
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:05,129
Kaiba. Look out!

836
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:12,763
Kaiba. No!

837
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:15,739
You have served
me well, little worm, -

838
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:19,506
- but you have outlived
your usefulness.

839
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:39,627
So it's been you behind this whole
duel, manipulating Kaiba all along.

840
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:42,736
The Egyptian Lord of
the Dead, Anubis.

841
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:47,239
I am pleased that you remember me
after all these years, my pharaoh.

842
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:50,708
It will make my ultimate
vengence all the more sweeter.

843
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:55,076
You will fall and my reign of
destruction shall begin.

844
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:58,476
- We'll see.
- The souls of your mortal friends -

845
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:01,713
- have already fallen, trapped
within your puzzle.

846
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:05,586
- My friends?
- Lost in a labyrinth of the dead.

847
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:08,456
You're wrong. I can still
sense their presence.

848
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:10,688
And I will fight to defend them.

849
01:11:10,967 --> 01:11:15,461
No matter what happens, I will not let
your evil plan come to pass, Anubis.

850
01:11:15,705 --> 01:11:19,038
All I need due is defeat
you in this duel.

851
01:11:19,209 --> 01:11:23,509
And the prophecy will be fulfilled.
You will be destroyed.

852
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:27,377
The magic of the Shadow Games that
you locked away centuries ago -

853
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:30,178
- will once again be unleashed
into the world.

854
01:11:30,353 --> 01:11:34,881
And I shall finally take my rightful place,
as the pharaoh of this realm.

855
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:37,692
With the Pyramid of Light
at my command -

856
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:40,652
- there's nothing you
can do to stop me.

857
01:11:41,765 --> 01:11:46,327
The ultimate Shadow
Game is just beginning.

858
01:12:08,058 --> 01:12:14,429
I summon the terrible beasts,
Andro Sphinx and Sphinx Teleia.

859
01:12:23,274 --> 01:12:25,765
<i>Reverse of Reverse.</i>

860
01:12:27,144 --> 01:12:30,511
Search your deck from
now until doomsday.

861
01:12:30,715 --> 01:12:35,584
And you still won't find anything to stand
against my savage Shadow Realm beasts.

862
01:12:35,753 --> 01:12:40,690
No, my pharaoh, I'm afraid that
for you doomsday is today.

863
01:12:44,195 --> 01:12:48,791
Now watch as your last line of defense
is ripped to shreds before your eyes.

864
01:12:48,999 --> 01:12:52,526
Sphinx Teleia, it is feeding time.

865
01:12:58,509 --> 01:13:00,272
My Celtic Guardian. No.

866
01:13:00,444 --> 01:13:04,244
And now it is your turn,
Andro Sphinx.

867
01:13:08,886 --> 01:13:11,912
Each time Andro Sphinx destroys a monster -

868
01:13:12,123 --> 01:13:15,092
- half of that monster's attack
points are taken away -

869
01:13:15,259 --> 01:13:20,162
- from my opponent's life points.
You have only 100 points left.

870
01:13:20,431 --> 01:13:22,229
- Oh, no.
- Yugi.

871
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:30,972
Your fate is sealed, pharaoh. Soon
you will be the relic burried away.

872
01:13:31,176 --> 01:13:36,341
Soon worms vil feast on your flesh,
just as they did on mine.

873
01:13:36,882 --> 01:13:42,980
Your worms will have to wait, Anubis.
I trust my fate to the heart of the cards.

874
01:13:43,321 --> 01:13:46,313
No monsters. Just two Magic Cards.

875
01:13:48,593 --> 01:13:51,494
That's all I have left.

876
01:13:55,801 --> 01:13:58,964
- He's all yours.
- I don't want you mummy.

877
01:14:00,205 --> 01:14:03,470
That eye up there seems
to be his power source.

878
01:14:04,109 --> 01:14:06,339
Hey, hold on. The prophecy.

879
01:14:06,511 --> 01:14:10,311
The eye that sees whats yet to come.
Its vision shall be fulfilled -

880
01:14:10,515 --> 01:14:13,109
- unless blinded by events
predetermined.

881
01:14:13,318 --> 01:14:16,344
Predetermined events is just
another way of saying fate.

882
01:14:16,555 --> 01:14:19,353
The prophecy means the eye
can be blinded by fate.

883
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:22,491
Heads up, you freak!

884
01:14:23,995 --> 01:14:26,088
The prophecy, I think
I have figured it out.

885
01:14:26,364 --> 01:14:29,163
- All right. The way is to use your head.
- We'll see.

886
01:14:29,335 --> 01:14:32,964
If I'm right I gotta find
that Dagger of Fate.

887
01:14:36,042 --> 01:14:39,375
Yugi, please hurry!

888
01:14:40,546 --> 01:14:44,312
It's empty. Please be in
here somewhere. Yes.

889
01:14:47,386 --> 01:14:49,013
Here it is.

890
01:14:49,255 --> 01:14:52,850
Let's just hope that
fate is on our side.

891
01:14:54,594 --> 01:14:56,221
Come on!

892
01:14:57,263 --> 01:14:59,561
No!

893
01:15:07,907 --> 01:15:10,842
<i>A weakness in the Pyramid's power.</i>

894
01:15:12,778 --> 01:15:14,211
I activate Double Spell.

895
01:15:14,413 --> 01:15:17,405
By discarding one card from my
hand, I can select a new one -

896
01:15:17,617 --> 01:15:20,916
- from my opponent's graveyard.
And use it as my own.

897
01:15:23,189 --> 01:15:26,454
And I know just the card I want.

898
01:15:31,597 --> 01:15:33,224
Monster Reborn.

899
01:15:33,432 --> 01:15:37,460
So come forth, mighty
Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon.

900
01:15:43,977 --> 01:15:48,539
And I have a hunch this time, your
pyramid won't be able to stand up to it.

901
01:15:48,782 --> 01:15:50,374
Go, Shining Nova.

902
01:15:50,684 --> 01:15:54,882
Use all your power to finish
what you started before -

903
01:15:55,088 --> 01:15:57,955
- and destroy the Pyramid of Light.

904
01:16:03,263 --> 01:16:05,026
Impossible.

905
01:16:49,477 --> 01:16:53,914
And with that I'll end my turn, now
that the Pyramid of Light is gone.

906
01:16:54,115 --> 01:16:58,176
Your opponent tried and failed to
destroy the pyramid with that dragon.

907
01:16:58,653 --> 01:17:00,587
You alone couldn't make
such a difference.

908
01:17:00,755 --> 01:17:03,656
You're quite right that I could
not have done it all alone.

909
01:17:03,858 --> 01:17:06,224
You may have destroyed
the card, pharaoh, -

910
01:17:06,427 --> 01:17:11,694
- but not the Pyramid of Light around
my neck. Behold its power.

911
01:17:13,267 --> 01:17:18,705
Inspired by your modern sayings:
Two heads are better than one.

912
01:17:20,475 --> 01:17:24,104
Thenien the Great Sphinx.

913
01:17:26,514 --> 01:17:32,942
And now, Pyramid of Light, feed this
perfect beast with Dead Souls Set Free.

914
01:17:43,898 --> 01:17:48,268
Hey look. Tell me that
attack meter is broke.

915
01:17:48,704 --> 01:17:51,605
Say hello, Thenien.

916
01:17:54,910 --> 01:17:57,538
5000 years ago, I
never had the chance -

917
01:17:57,746 --> 01:17:59,873
- to summon Thenien to our battle.

918
01:18:00,049 --> 01:18:03,507
So I think it'd be best if
we made up for lost time -

919
01:18:03,719 --> 01:18:06,153
- and finally had a
proper introduction.

920
01:18:06,321 --> 01:18:10,917
Thenien, meet the pharaoh,
and pharaoh meet your doom.

921
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:14,155
<i>We don't have anything
that can beat that sphinx.</i>

922
01:18:14,396 --> 01:18:18,958
<i>Yes, we do, Yugi. If I'm correct
about what Kaiba was planning.</i>

923
01:18:19,401 --> 01:18:21,266
Now Anubis, this is still a duel -

924
01:18:21,437 --> 01:18:24,406
- and I still have one face
down card to play.

925
01:18:24,606 --> 01:18:25,937
Reverse of Reverse, -

926
01:18:26,108 --> 01:18:30,477
- which allows me to use the
last card played by Kaiba:

927
01:18:32,414 --> 01:18:35,076
Return from the Different Dimension.

928
01:18:35,284 --> 01:18:38,117
When Kaiba spoke of dealing
me the perfect defeat, -

929
01:18:38,287 --> 01:18:42,280
- he meant wiping me out
with my own Egyptian Gods.

930
01:18:45,561 --> 01:18:50,498
Allow me to introduce Obelisk
the Tormentor, Slifer the Sky Dragon -

931
01:18:50,766 --> 01:18:52,701
- and The Winged Dragon of Ra.

932
01:18:52,869 --> 01:18:59,274
My Egyptian Gods, combine
now! For infinite power.

933
01:19:14,057 --> 01:19:17,549
Now go, Titan Firestorm!

934
01:19:38,314 --> 01:19:40,305
No.

935
01:19:44,954 --> 01:19:47,047
- Yeah, Yugi!
- All right!

936
01:19:47,257 --> 01:19:49,282
Yeah!

937
01:20:00,437 --> 01:20:03,338
- You did it.
- We did it.

938
01:20:11,248 --> 01:20:14,809
Kaiba. Are you all right?

939
01:20:15,085 --> 01:20:17,610
Let me help you.

940
01:20:17,822 --> 01:20:20,120
I can take care of myself.

941
01:20:30,267 --> 01:20:32,497
What the...?

942
01:20:34,271 --> 01:20:38,264
<i>Shadows take life.
Creatures be born.</i>

943
01:20:38,475 --> 01:20:43,913
<i>Now let see how well you play this game,
when the monsters are real.</i>

944
01:20:44,582 --> 01:20:46,846
- Monsters?
- For real?

945
01:20:47,051 --> 01:20:52,717
<i>It is no longer time to duel.
Now it is time to die.</i>

946
01:21:06,738 --> 01:21:11,198
<i>Nothing in your decks of
cards can save you now.</i>

947
01:21:19,017 --> 01:21:22,453
<i>It appears you are one
card short, pharaoh.</i>

948
01:21:22,654 --> 01:21:25,020
Yeah, but I'm not.

949
01:21:25,991 --> 01:21:30,485
Attack! Gilford the Lightning
and Gearfried the Iron Knight.

950
01:21:30,729 --> 01:21:33,220
<i>Begone!</i>

951
01:21:40,338 --> 01:21:46,538
<i>You have no concept of my powers
and now the end begins.</i>

952
01:21:56,421 --> 01:21:58,889
We're pancakes.

953
01:22:01,226 --> 01:22:02,887
Not yet.

954
01:22:04,329 --> 01:22:06,297
These Toon Monsters
won't last long.

955
01:22:06,531 --> 01:22:09,501
We have to get out of here,
while we still have the chance.

956
01:22:09,702 --> 01:22:11,602
Yugi, I know you'll take
this creep down.

957
01:22:11,804 --> 01:22:14,466
Yes, you would, 'cause we will
be with you all the way.

958
01:22:14,674 --> 01:22:16,733
- Always.
- Always.

959
01:22:19,412 --> 01:22:21,710
Fine, fine. Let's go, already.

960
01:22:46,739 --> 01:22:49,207
How can we beat a real monster?

961
01:22:49,709 --> 01:22:52,041
How? With a real monster.

962
01:22:52,211 --> 01:22:54,611
- Yugi.
- What's this?

963
01:22:54,847 --> 01:22:57,509
The one card that can beat him.

964
01:22:57,683 --> 01:23:00,846
It's time to get real with a
Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon.

965
01:23:05,992 --> 01:23:07,789
- Shining Nova, attack!
- Shining Nova, attack!

966
01:23:08,094 --> 01:23:10,892
If the monsters are real,
so are all their powers -

967
01:23:11,063 --> 01:23:14,932
- including this dragon's ability
to destroy any monster.

968
01:23:21,908 --> 01:23:24,001
Destroy Anubis!

969
01:23:29,149 --> 01:23:32,050
Wow, check it out.

970
01:23:36,656 --> 01:23:38,317
No!

971
01:24:44,625 --> 01:24:46,889
He's not coming back again, right?

972
01:24:47,995 --> 01:24:52,432
We should take a closer look at that prophecy
to see what it foretells for the future.

973
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:55,160
Oh please, old man. Anubis is gone.

974
01:24:55,403 --> 01:24:59,703
No one could return after suffering a
defeat so thoroughly devastating as that.

975
01:24:59,907 --> 01:25:02,671
Well. No one but Kaiba, that is.

976
01:25:02,910 --> 01:25:05,845
- I'm sorry, did I say that out loud?
- Kaiba.

977
01:25:06,013 --> 01:25:09,210
Oh, please, spare me all your
bull about friendship, will ya?

978
01:25:09,450 --> 01:25:12,283
If it wasn't for that freak crashing
the party we both know that -

979
01:25:12,487 --> 01:25:15,456
- the winner of todays duel
would have been me.

980
01:25:15,656 --> 01:25:19,422
So enjoy your last days of being
champion. Why you still can.

981
01:25:19,694 --> 01:25:22,390
I gotta say it's nice to
have the old Kaiba back.

982
01:25:22,630 --> 01:25:27,125
Yeah? Well this conversation's
over. We'll duel again.

983
01:25:28,370 --> 01:25:30,338
Wait up!

984
01:25:31,707 --> 01:25:35,336
I'm sure glad he didn't bring up all
the damage you did to the Duel Dome.

985
01:25:35,544 --> 01:25:37,910
'Cause I don't think his
insurance is gonna cover this.

986
01:25:38,113 --> 01:25:41,571
He's got plenty of money, Grandpa.
But what he doesn't have is one of these.

987
01:25:41,783 --> 01:25:45,082
And unless he changes he won't
have best friends like this.

988
01:25:45,354 --> 01:25:47,822
What Kaiba doesn't get is
that victory means nothing, -

989
01:25:48,023 --> 01:25:50,651
- unless you can share it
with the people you love.

990
01:25:50,826 --> 01:25:53,192
'Cause then...

991
01:25:53,495 --> 01:25:55,224
You're really a winner.

992
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:57,261
You can say that again.

993
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:18,000
