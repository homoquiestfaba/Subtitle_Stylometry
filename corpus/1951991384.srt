1
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,321
I think violence
is always justified some of the time.

2
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,797
<i>- So if I disagree, that means you're gonna hit me.
- Hey, Grover.</i>

3
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,834
Hey, Gail.

4
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:12,632
Who would you rather be stranded
on a desert island with? MacNeil or Lehrer?

5
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,707
<i>Ebert.</i>

6
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:30,253
Oh, I'll tell you the worst thing
about losing a foot. Hey, man!

7
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,570
Evening.

8
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:04,218
Jane, I knew you'd win the fiction prize.

9
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,792
You're a -You're a brilliant writer.

10
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,191
Would you like to dance?

11
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,787
Oh, I would, Lester,
but I find you irritatingly attractive.

12
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,663
Ah, here's my drunk boyfriend.

13
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:22,803
I was gonna wear my goatee tonight.
And wouldn't that have been embarrassing?

14
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:26,106
Mmm, yeah. Goatee season is in full bloom.
It's all those film majors.

15
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:30,444
I was tempted to put vodka in your cran-orange.
I don't know how you can not drink at these parties.

16
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,780
I saw you trip when you got your diploma.

17
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,878
Careful.

18
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,253
You got pig in a blanket on your chin.

19
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,556
Oh, congratulations
on the fiction prize.

20
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:46,155
Yeah. You could have, uh, won if you'd submitted.
Or at least it would have been close.

21
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,235
Even though all 618 of us were wearing
caps and gowns out there today...

22
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,327
I couldn't help but think it was a coincidence
that we were both wearing black.

23
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:55,532
Thank you.
That's almost a sweet thing for you to say.

24
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,441
To life after college.

25
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,182
Hey. Do you -
Do you forget things ever when you drink?

26
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,191
You mean black out? No.

27
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:17,730
Well, no. I - I don't really black out,
but I don't - I don't always remember everything.

28
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,424
Do you think that's reason for concern?

29
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,559
- Probably.
- What do you mean, "probably"?

30
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,537
You've got a drinking problem.
Get help.

31
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,172
- Is that a pajama top?
- No.

32
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,515
Yes.

33
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,589
You know, you're sneaky like that.
Like that thing in that movie.

34
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:50,061
<i>- No, I'm not like him.
- Hey, Jane. Czechoslovakia. Wild.</i>

35
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,393
Watch out.

36
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,489
You got into the university?

37
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,762
Yeah. I'm going to Prague.

38
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,772
<i>They called me this afternoon.</i>

39
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,932
<i>Someone dropped out of the program.
So I guess there's an opening now.</i>

40
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:06,773
So it's off to Prague to go to school.
I know that Prague's a cliché now, but -

41
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,473
Um, so how will that work
if you're living with me in Brooklyn?

42
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,050
Well, it'll be the same,
except I'll be in Prague.

43
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:15,882
Not just Brooklyn. A-list Brooklyn.
Park Slope, Division II Manhattan.

44
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,516
Prague is Division I Bratislava.

45
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:23,062
You might want to slow down.
There's no alcohol in that.

46
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:26,598
Okay. Czechoslovakia is just
the worst place to go.

47
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,566
The way I see it, eventually
you'll make your life in the States.

48
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,399
Why run away now? You're just
postponing that "get started" year.

49
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,269
I'm not postponing anything.
I'm postponing months of emotional paralysis.

50
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,434
Exactly.
It's a bad idea to go directly.

51
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:40,410
The paralysis is just gonna, uh,
wait for you when you get -

52
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,447
- Wh-What are you writing?
- Some notes.

53
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,847
Will you stop writing what I'm saying.
Can we have one spontaneous conversation...

54
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,113
where my dialogue
doesn't end up in your next story?

55
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,815
- What if I want this material?
- We'll see who gets it first.

56
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,551
Okay. Let me borrow your pen.
I'm gonna write...

57
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,855
"Selfish girl...

58
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,989
abandons helpless boy
for overrated country. "

59
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,067
Overrated?

60
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:06,333
- You've never even been to Prague.
- Oh, I've been to Prague.

61
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,376
<i>- Well, I haven't been to Prague been to Prague.
- Yeah.</i>

62
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,468
But I know that thing.
I know that...

63
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:16,878
<i>"stop shaving your armpits,
read The Unbearable Lightness of Being...</i>

64
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,441
fall in love with a sculptor,
now I realize how bad American coffee is" thing.

65
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:24,045
- Beer. They have good beer.
- "How bad American beer is" thing.

66
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,223
- "How bad American beer is" thing.
- Yeah. I heard you the first time.

67
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:39,504
I am so glad to find
an actual adult at one of these parties.

68
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,937
It's really just a bunch of
freaked-out kids, huh?

69
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,441
Yeah.

70
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,944
- I'm Josselyn.
- Josselyn.

71
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,879
- What an interesting name. I'm Chet.
- Chet.

72
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,882
- Hello.
- So what do you do?

73
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,578
I'm a, uh, philosophy/German major.

74
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:58,555
- Philosophy/German?
- Mm-hmm.

75
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,558
I don't get it.

76
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,857
- You're -You're not still a student, are you?
- Oh, yeah. Well, technically.

77
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,931
At least until I complete my thesis.

78
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,694
Which is becoming more and more
overwhelming each year.

79
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,792
This third tome
has become quite a battle.

80
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,895
Which is odd because the second book
came quite effortlessly.

81
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,940
How many years have you been here?

82
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,408
Oh, God. It'll be...

83
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,411
10 come January.

84
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:23,482
But I skipped a semester my sophomore year.

85
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,413
Yeah.

86
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,079
- Nice party.
- Yes, it is.

87
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,215
About as good
as the one three years ago...

88
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,658
and much better
than last year and the year before.

89
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:40,426
Although, in my opinion, this doesn't
hold a candle to the one six years ago.

90
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,592
There was a horse at that one.

91
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:46,661
I didn't go to the one five years ago.
I don't know why. I think I just...

92
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,741
didn't feel like a party, but -

93
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,844
But -

94
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,247
Hmm.

95
00:06:56,349 --> 00:07:00,183
My parents fly in from Chicago,
rent out these swank digs, booze old Otis up...

96
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,379
but apparently
it's still not up to his standards.

97
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:06,584
- I just - I felt a little antsy. I couldn't eat.
- You have two emotions: antsy and testy.

98
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:10,492
And now I'm antsy.
What? Come on. I'm a little guy.

99
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:14,498
- What are you talking about? You're enormous.
- No. But you know what I mean. I'm little.

100
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,001
- You're like a monster. You're huge.
- Yeah, but inside I'm little.

101
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,004
I don't know. Small maybe. I'm small.

102
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,132
As a little guy, I can't do all the things
that all the bigger guys do.

103
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,142
Boys.

104
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:28,145
<i>- You're out of your mind is what you are.
- Where's Grover?</i>

105
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:34,517
<i>The first thing I'm gonna do
is read all the great short novels.</i>

106
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,282
<i>- You wanna get married?
- Yes. Yes, I do.</i>

107
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,359
You okay?

108
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,360
'Cause you fell. I wondered -

109
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,657
Can you name me eight movies
where monkeys play a key role?

110
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:48,427
<i>- Ding! Uh, Going Ape. Mighty Joe Young.
- Monkeys.</i>

111
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:51,867
<i>- For all of our sakes, I hope nobody gets this.
- Monkey Shines. Monkey Trouble.</i>

112
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,168
<i>- In a few hours I'm gonna lose all identity.
- King Kong. The other King Kong.</i>

113
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:58,539
<i>- Eight hours ago I was Max Belmont, English major, college senior.
- La Femme "Monkita. "</i>

114
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,044
<i>- Now I am Max Belmont who does nothing.
- Man, Boy and Monkeys.</i>

115
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,546
What are you talking about?

116
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,116
<i>- Monkeys, Monkeys, Ted and Alice.
- What do I do? I do nothing.</i>

117
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,118
- All my accomplishments are in the past.
- Monkeys -

118
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,745
Okay. Monkeys is a stupid subject.

119
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:13,758
- Yeah. Monkeys is a stupid - a stupid subject.
- Yeah.

120
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,556
How about name me
six empiricist philosophers.

121
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,562
- Okay. Hume.
- Ding! Ding! Uh -

122
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,564
- Hume.
- For Christ's sake, can it, Skippy.

123
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,226
- All the other ones.
- How about worst-case scenarios after graduation?

124
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,930
<i>- Ding. Heart attack.
- Ding.</i>

125
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,666
Live in Milwaukee.

126
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,242
- Live in Milwaukee.
- Forget everything you learned.

127
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:35,144
I didn't learn enough in the first place to forget,
and, honey, you did not ding in...

128
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,580
and this is definitely not for juniors.

129
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,223
I'm sorry.
I was completely out of line there.

130
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,792
Ding. Forget everything you learned.

131
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,089
<i>- Really, Skippy.
- John Grisham's The Monkey.</i>

132
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:54,428
<i>Um, Monkeys, Monkeys, Ted and Alice.
Carnal Monkeys.</i>

133
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,862
Prague. You'll come back a bug.

134
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,602
You could maybe sympathize
with my choice of Prague over Brooklyn.

135
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,552
I - I quit.

136
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,848
- What do you mean you quit? You quit?
- I quit.

137
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,924
I see. First you only smoke after meals,
then just once or twice a day...

138
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,925
and now all of a sudden you're quitting.

139
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,791
You could come with me, you know.

140
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,490
What's for me in Prague?

141
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,033
Places Kafka lived.

142
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,103
Me.

143
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,996
So all of a sudden
you just stopped smoking?

144
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,268
Meanwhile I'm up to
two fucking packs a day.

145
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,503
Twenty years I make it
through all that peer pressure.

146
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:43,241
<i>- Suddenly, my senior year, you get me addicted.
- Because you smoke now, I should too?</i>

147
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,910
No. But what you did was snea -
Yes, you should smoke too!

148
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,715
I told you I was quitting.
You didn't pay any attention.

149
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:54,657
You're a foul-weather friend, Grover. You're
not interested in me unless I'm suffering like you.

150
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,887
You're like a child sometimes.

151
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,658
Yeah, but if I was a child,
you'd find that endearing.

152
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,598
<i>Hey, Jane! Prague! Whoo!</i>

153
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,670
Yeah, I'll "whoo" you.

154
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,440
I don't know what else to say.

155
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,515
Do you have anything you'd like to add?

156
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,564
Josselyn. Hi!

157
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,633
Fine.

158
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:38,363
<i>- Chet. Chet. My man.
- Louis! My friend!</i>

159
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,031
Louis! Oh, Louis!

160
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,371
Tell me. Did you graduate
accidentally or on purpose?

161
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,446
- I'm gonna miss you, man.
- Oh, I'm gonna miss you, my friend.

162
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,480
- I love you.
- Louis, I love you too.

163
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,949
- Okay, Louis. I've gotta go now. Bye-bye.
- Okay.

164
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,456
So how does that work?

165
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,784
Do I - Do I have to start
paying back my loan, like, tomorrow?

166
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:03,885
I'm gonna go look for pot.

167
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,732
Don't you sometimes wish
there was another position in sex?

168
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,101
Just something else to do.

169
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:18,040
Hey, Grover.
Worst-case scenario after graduation.

170
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,773
Ding.
Jane dumps me to move to Prague.

171
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,281
I spend the rest of my life with you idiots.

172
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,425
That was more of a yield at that stop sign.

173
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,523
I broke. Thanks.

174
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:44,296
No. It was more of a yield.

175
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:48,863
<i>Flight 368 to Chicago now boarding at Gate 7.</i>

176
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,942
<i>Look at him.</i>

177
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,942
- What's in Milwaukee?
- Your graduate school.

178
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,175
Your, uh -What does he study?

179
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:02,243
- Uh, mechanical engineering, I think.
- Mechanical engineering. Right. Go.

180
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:06,085
- I hate readjusting my watch.
- Don't check your bags. They'll just lose them.

181
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,922
God! I hate fooling with the watch!

182
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:13,728
Oh, I can't change my habits.
I'll be sleeping all day, awake all night.

183
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,394
- It's Milwaukee.
- It's only an hour's difference, Otis. You won't even notice.

184
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,836
Yeah, I'll be hungry at 5:00.
I'll be ready for the local news at 4:00.

185
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,768
This is useless. We just have to walk away
like mothers in nursery school.

186
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,216
Bye, Otis.

187
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,603
Well, that settles Otis.

188
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:56,004
What I used to be able to pass off
as just another bad summer...

189
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,338
could now potentially
turn into a bad life.

190
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,105
Ah. The fan.

191
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,116
The trusty fan.

192
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:09,312
Everyone brings this to school,
uses it for about three or four days...

193
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:12,413
and then shoves it in the closet
for the remainder of the semester.

194
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,187
I use that fan all the time.

195
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,421
All the time.

196
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,897
Oh. Okay. Cool.

197
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,863
- Kudos, Miami!
- Hi, Friedrich.

198
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,370
Well, you are looking lovely
this semester.

199
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,033
More appropriate for a runway
than these environs.

200
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,978
<i>- Fuck!
- What are you doing here?</i>

201
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,049
Well, what is wrong with this picture?

202
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,983
Some explaining?
I thought you graduated.

203
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,213
Yeah, I did.
I'm just helping Miami move in.

204
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,517
- Uh-huh.
- Actually, I might be living around here.

205
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:49,253
- Mm-hmm. Oh, yes. Uh-huh.
- I haven't decided yet. I've got all these decisions.

206
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,332
Hey, Jacob. How are you?

207
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,909
Jesus.

208
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,873
<i>God, I have that horrible song
stuck in my head.</i>

209
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,808
Hum something
so I can get rid of it.

210
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,444
I don't know that.
Hum something else.

211
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,924
Who the hell bought black-eyed peas?

212
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,933
Hi, Grover. It's Dad. Call me.

213
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,935
I'm in Boston at the Greenbergs.

214
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,232
Did you see the Knicks/Bulls
exhibition on Saturday?

215
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,239
Call me there to discuss.

216
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:19,440
- I just spent my last 20 on groceries.
- You're poor.

217
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,486
Yeah. Since graduation,
I'm poor, you're rich.

218
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,648
- We are no longer equal.
- But my parents are rich.

219
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,692
- You know what I wish?
- Mmm.

220
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:31,285
- I wish we were just going off to war.
- Hmm.

221
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:34,662
Or retiring.
I wish I was just retiring...

222
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,099
after a lifetime of hard labor.

223
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,602
Mmm! Mmm!

224
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,605
- Get down.
- Why?

225
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,607
Get down! It's a cookie man.

226
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,406
The guy who goes door-to-door selling cookies.
I saw him earlier in the neighborhood.

227
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,414
He is so hard to say no to.
Just stay down.

228
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,383
I can't handle him.
He'll go away soon.

229
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,947
Well, how long do we have to stay down here?

230
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,389
Go away, cookie man.

231
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,398
Cookie man?

232
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,368
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I - I felt antsy.

233
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,530
I thought there was more reason for me to stay.

234
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,165
- It's remarkable.
- But Milwaukee and graduate school.

235
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:21,303
<i>No. I-I'm gonna defer my admission.
I think I'll move back in with my mom for a while.</i>

236
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,438
- Hello.
- Oh, look who I found.

237
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,382
Hi, kids.
Got you a little back-to-school gift.

238
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,680
Oh, great! Dictionary!

239
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,755
Hey. I'm gonna look up "blow job. "

240
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,384
<i>- This is great, Chet. Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.</i>

241
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,393
So, did you have fun at the airport?

242
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:40,022
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, here. I got you some magazines.

243
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,033
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

244
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:46,070
What would you rather do,
fuck a cow or lose your mother?

245
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,366
Hmm. Fuck a cow.

246
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,374
Cow-fucker.

247
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,741
What would you rather do,
fuck, uh, Peppermint Patty or Lucy?

248
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:57,805
- Uh, Lucy.
- Lucy-fucker.

249
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,317
What would you rather do,
uh, fuck a cow or a turkey?

250
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,354
Hmm. Wild or farm-raised?

251
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,582
Uh, no idea.
Just answer the question.

252
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,591
- Turkey.
- You know -

253
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,527
- Turkey-fucker.
- I regret not taking my junior year abroad.

254
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,497
<i>- Skippy, don't let Friedrich bother you. Okay?
- He doesn't bother me.</i>

255
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,831
- Yes, he is. He's bothering you.
- I said I wish I had taken my junior year off.

256
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:22,100
But you shouldn't even let it get to you.
He's this Eurotrash guy. I mean -

257
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,870
- He doesn't bother me.
- You. Uh, cow or lose your mother?

258
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,742
- What?
- Would you rather fuck a cow or lose your mother?

259
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,680
- Answer the question.
- Who's asking the question?

260
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:36,382
- Answer the question.
- Neither, thanks.

261
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:40,117
- Hmm. Doesn't like to fuck.
- I don't know! A cow.

262
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,853
- Cow-fucker.
- Well, that's his thing.

263
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,241
There.

264
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,706
Yeah. You're right.
No, you're right.

265
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,510
If they hadn't called a technical on Riley,
they would've won.

266
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:08,711
Hey, uh, who won Bud Bowl II?

267
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:12,382
That is a bad habit.
You really ought to finish that in the bathroom.

268
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:17,086
<i>What about that call with half a minute left?
Ewing was pushed.</i>

269
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,131
<i>- Yeah. You're right, Dad.
- Oh, that's good.</i>

270
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,391
<i>- Yeah. It was definitely a push.
- Hello, fellas.</i>

271
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,402
- What's up?
- Yeah.

272
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,404
<i>- Hey, Chet.
- Skippy.</i>

273
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,406
- I know.
- What's up?

274
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,476
Hold on, Dad.

275
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,373
- What are you doing with that?
- I packed it by accident.

276
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:41,214
<i>- Did you see all the people moving in?
- Oh, how are the freshmen biddies?</i>

277
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,447
Deadly. Best since two years ago.

278
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,921
Hmm. Yeah, well...

279
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,924
I've been doing a little research.

280
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:51,223
Now, we all know how old Mozart was
when he did all that.

281
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,059
Like, one.

282
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,000
And Keats. Big poet, Keats.

283
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,798
Keats was dead by 24.

284
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:03,807
And Tracy Austin -
When she started playing, she was tiny.

285
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,809
Mmm.

286
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:10,075
I'd like to 15-love with her,
if you know what I mean. Ace her deuce.

287
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:13,913
I'd like to fuck her on the tennis court,
if you get my meaning.

288
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,146
Yeah.

289
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,757
Are you wearing mascara?

290
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,260
No.

291
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,262
Yes.

292
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,735
Let's hit the Penguin.
It's, like, what? 1:20?

293
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,204
It's almost cocktail hour.
Chet, tell - tell Grover we went to the Penguin.

294
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:36,865
Okay.

295
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,808
- Yeah.
- Wait. I just wanna see if they get the stain out.

296
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,904
It's a detergent commercial, Otis.
They're gonna get it out.

297
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,882
Yeah. But that's bicycle grease.

298
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:51,554
<i>Unlike the other brand, that stain is gone-</i>

299
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,591
Okay. Let's go.

300
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,287
Why do you think everyone
on the Knicks is dysfunctional, Dad?

301
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,364
Riley is not depressed.

302
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:03,460
Dad, that's silly.
Riley's happily married.

303
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,536
No, I think it's a successful marriage.

304
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,533
Look, I gotta go.

305
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,543
Okay.

306
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:16,136
Okay. We'll discuss this.

307
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,216
All right.

308
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,252
Okay. Bye.

309
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:30,155
<i>"Was it the woman in lace-top thigh-highs?</i>

310
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,162
<i>"The chemise and wrap?</i>

311
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:35,131
<i>"The matte satin boxer pajamas?</i>

312
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,202
<i>"Or the Taylor strapless bra?</i>

313
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,303
<i>"He closed the catalog.</i>

314
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,670
"Gower felt like he could
shout into Father's pillow.

315
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,834
And he never got her call. "

316
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:51,138
- Lester.
- I find this is Grover's most mature work to date.

317
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,242
The scene with the carrot peeler
really resonated.

318
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:57,413
<i>The piece really had
a One Hundred Years of Solitude bent to it.</i>

319
00:20:57,522 --> 00:21:00,013
- Right.
- I'll give you one hundred years of solitude.

320
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,252
The prose is like the bastard child
of Raymond Carver.

321
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:05,626
<i>Like Ray Carver meets Fitzgerald.</i>

322
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:08,029
<i>- Gail.
- When you think about it...</i>

323
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:11,000
the main character
has a little Holden Caulfield...

324
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,367
crossed with Humbert Humbert...

325
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:16,839
<i>and then in that sort of
pseudo Russian novel ilk.</i>

326
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,367
I think it's Grover's best work to date.

327
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,674
Yes.

328
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,112
You're pretty.

329
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,485
I'd like to say first up that, uh...

330
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,613
the prose is remarkable.

331
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,816
It's beautifully written.

332
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:39,058
<i>Uh, however, I've noticed that, uh,
the characters in Grover's stories...</i>

333
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:43,863
spend all their time
discussing the least important... things.

334
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:48,167
<i>Uh- You know,
like what to have for dinner or...</i>

335
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:51,970
who's the best-looking model
in the Victoria's Secret catalog.

336
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,238
I don't know.
To me, the story just seemed slight.

337
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:57,213
It had the feeling of being
written in - in one night.

338
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,784
I - I think I said plenty.

339
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:03,013
Uh, perhaps something rubbed Ms. -

340
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,817
Hayworth.

341
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:10,623
<i>Well, it seems I must have done something right
if Ms. Hayworth has reacted so strongly.</i>

342
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:13,459
And this was a particularly hot issue
of Victoria's Secret.

343
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:16,864
They had to make some
very tough decisions.

344
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:22,702
You -You joke, but I really see nothing wrong
with dealing with the important subject matter.

345
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:25,436
All that thought and energy
put into Saturday morning cartoons.

346
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,637
I - I think its depressing.

347
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:48,059
Max. Max. Max. I put my hand in my mouth after
I touched all that money. Can that be bad for you?

348
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,157
Of course.
That's how germs are spread.

349
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,703
<i>- Chet. Two pitchers, please.
- Sir.</i>

350
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:57,241
So my feeling is we're like a club.
A bunch of guys hanging out all the time.

351
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:59,537
- We should have a name.
- What do you have in mind?

352
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:03,444
<i>I don't know. Something that won't
sound so stupid, look good on a satin jacket.</i>

353
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:07,143
- Have you heard from Jane, Grover?
- Uh, no. We didn't end so good.

354
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:09,550
<i>- How are you, Chet?
- I got a postcard from her.</i>

355
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,122
That's one of Kafka's houses.

356
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,692
Something tough.

357
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,489
- Cougars?
- As you can probably imagine...

358
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,996
I've lost quite a few
girlfriends to graduation.

359
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,089
<i>What do you think about Cougars?</i>

360
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,533
- Get the glasses.
- Thank you, sir.

361
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,535
No. Wait.
No. You're making me make myself dizzy.

362
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,579
Skippy wants to name our group.

363
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,580
- What group?
- What's the name?

364
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:40,651
- I was thinking of something like Cougars or Hawks or something.
- I see.

365
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,210
- We could get matching lobster bibs with our names.
- Or a special brand for cattle.

366
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:47,587
- Forget it. Let's go to the Hole.
- No. No way. No Hole for me.

367
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:50,525
That's where we're comfortable.
That's -That's where the fun is.

368
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,529
Freshman biddies are there.

369
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:55,498
I don't need to go to a campus bar
to be reminded of my lack of success...

370
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,500
with a bunch of thrill-seeking
snotty college kids.

371
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,366
That's us!
We're like celebrities to them.

372
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,440
<i>No. We were celebrities.</i>

373
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,907
<i>Now going back would be
like doing Hollywood Squares.</i>

374
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,103
I'm too nostalgic. I'll admit it.

375
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:10,272
We graduated four months ago.
What can you possibly be nostalgic for?

376
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:13,840
- I'll be right back.
- I'm nostalgic for conversations I had yesterday.

377
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:17,388
I've begun reminiscing events before
they even occur. I'm reminiscing this right now.

378
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:22,722
I can't go to the bar because I've already looked back
on it in my memory, and I didn't have a good time.

379
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:25,353
Yeah. I - I think I'm gonna
switch back to briefs.

380
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,534
Kate.

381
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,536
It's great to see you.

382
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,970
Grover, if you're still here,
you could tutor me.

383
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:39,339
- Uh, yeah. I'd like that.
- That's high-speed.

384
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:41,378
Got any stories for me to read?

385
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,109
Uh, not yet.
I think you're up to date on my oeuvre.

386
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,151
How's your love life, Grover?

387
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:50,585
It's okay. It's a C-plus.
It's okay.

388
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,523
- I've reenrolled in school.
- You can't do that.

389
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:57,026
Oh, can't I?
Hey, Chet. Come over here.

390
00:24:57,128 --> 00:25:00,029
- Oh, God. Don't bring him over here.
- Chet!

391
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,497
Why not?
He's taken every class in the school.

392
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:05,866
- He's like some kind of mad genius.
- It's like having a parent around.

393
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:08,496
- You can't reenroll.
- Ah, but I can, Max.

394
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:12,099
See, I have money saved up
from my valet parking job over the summer...

395
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,668
and fortunately, that Cutlass's fender
I crushed isn't gonna sue.

396
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,773
<i>I'm auditing the classes I think I missed out on
in our measly four years.</i>

397
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:24,185
<i>Look. We didn't learn enough in school,
and now it's up to us to educate ourselves.</i>

398
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,849
<i>- I think Chet'll back me up here.
- Got your back.</i>

399
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,892
<i>- Thank you.
- What are you takin'?</i>

400
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:32,521
<i>I'm taking, uh-
What are you doing? Give me that.</i>

401
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,531
You're always taking things.

402
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:37,261
You're not interested in anything
unless someone else has it.

403
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,827
- Who's the child?
- This is Kate, my tutee.

404
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,874
What do you know about tutoring?
And Otis, with his mechanical engi -

405
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:47,604
Why does everybody have these little things
they do that I don't know anything about?

406
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,476
'Cause you don't listen.
I know Kate.

407
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:53,483
Thank you.
Max, you're a philosophy major.

408
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:58,818
You'll be interested in this. I'm taking
Ethics, Scandinavian Lit, Personality.

409
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:02,121
<i>- You took Personality.
- No. I took Behavior. There's a difference.</i>

410
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:06,095
- A very big one.
- You know, you guys all talk the same.

411
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,598
Okay. I'm going home.
I got boxes to pack.

412
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:13,535
If Mrs. Eargle is teaching
Scandinavian Lit, I wouldn't take it.

413
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:15,799
She's okay one-on-one,
but a horrible lecturer.

414
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,206
Enjoy school.
It was nice to meet you, Kate.

415
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,973
- Chet, always a pleasure.
- Sir.

416
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,943
- Me and Max met before.
- He's just being cool.

417
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,645
Trust me.
Max won't ever enjoy life, the way he acts.

418
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,916
Hey. I might have a job.
I have to go back for my second interview.

419
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,719
Really? Great! Where?

420
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,885
Video Planet.

421
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:39,327
You need a second interview
at Video Planet?

422
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,831
- Apparently.
- Huh.

423
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,834
What time is it?

424
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,905
Aw, shit. I'm supposed to meet Miami
at the Hole five minutes ago.

425
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,906
I'll see you guys there?

426
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,340
Cougars. Cougars.

427
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,207
Cougars!

428
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,872
Well, that's true.
That's true, Rick.

429
00:26:56,982 --> 00:27:00,440
But if you'll excuse me,
and I'm paraphrasing myself here...

430
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,715
but I have said before
that if Plato is a fine red wine...

431
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,916
then Aristotle is a dry martini.

432
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,687
Just so you understand me.

433
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:16,395
Imagine it's going much more quickly though now.

434
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,340
Oh. Thank you.

435
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,344
Thanks a lot.

436
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,015
Thanks very much.

437
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:38,922
Oh, my God.

438
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,188
Jesus.

439
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:45,751
Look at this.
There's, like, food in here.

440
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:48,264
- In the beer. There's food in the beer!
- Return it.

441
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:51,130
No. I mean, I don't want to upset her.
No, no, no, no, no, no!

442
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,227
- Return it.
- I - I don't want to bother her.

443
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,397
She seems really irritable -
a little distant.

444
00:27:55,507 --> 00:28:00,604
I don't know. I think it's been a hard day for her.
This might just set her over the edge.

445
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:03,806
I want her to like me.
I - I like this better anyway.

446
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,481
It's like a piece of chicken wing
or a... cheese fry.

447
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:15,389
- I mean, look at this.
- Don't complain to me if you're not gonna return it.

448
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,512
I probably should have sent it back, I guess.

449
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:38,343
Wait a minute. Listen. Seriously.
Don't tell Max about it.

450
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,350
Ah, the Hole.

451
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:42,579
- Oh. I should have brought my hanky.
- What?

452
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:45,815
Yeah, I'm gonna start wearing a hanky around.
It's a pretty good idea.

453
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:49,257
I think I made a wise decision with these
slacks tonight. What do you think?

454
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,328
Oh. Grover. Grover.

455
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:53,329
Me likes what me sees.

456
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,399
- She wants you.
- Really?

457
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,765
- Oh, yeah.
- Why? Do you know her? No. Seriously, do you know her?

458
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:10,747
I.D.

459
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,374
<i>Come on, man. Let's go. Good song.</i>

460
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,385
<i>Hey, sweetheart.</i>

461
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:19,685
- You look great.
- You do too.

462
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,759
<i>Move it along.</i>

463
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:29,460
- All right. Go ahead, man.
- Oh. Thanks.

464
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,728
<i>- Hurry up. Hurry up.
- You got an I. D?</i>

465
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:34,031
<i>- He's inside already.
- Yeah.</i>

466
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,232
Oh, you know what?
I don't have it on me.

467
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:39,105
- Listen. I'm way over 21.
- I need proof.

468
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:43,704
- You certainly look old enough, but I need proof.
- Shit.

469
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:47,182
- Where the hell did I leave it?
- Gotta have "id. "

470
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,549
Can't drink without "id. "

471
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:56,787
And so this friend of mine, you know,
got a big hoop as a nose ring...

472
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:59,363
and one day, while she was
running to make a class...

473
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:03,025
she got it caught in somebody else's hair
who was running in the other direction.

474
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,625
It ripped half her nose off.

475
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:08,968
Well, there's also that dark side
to the nose ring.

476
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:12,133
You know, you would look good
with a nose ring.

477
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:14,143
Yeah. I'm probably gonna get one.

478
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,305
Yeah. It would have to be something,
like, right here. Right in the center.

479
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:21,681
- But that would give you a tribal look.
- Yeah. That's nice. Thank you. I think that's a good suggestion.

480
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:25,984
Look at this girl. God, I'd like to fuck the dickens
out of her, if you know what I mean.

481
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,422
No, I have no idea what you mean.

482
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:34,392
Well, if it isn't fuck suck ass shit cock!

483
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,158
- That's Fish. He's pretty cool.
- Yeah.

484
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:42,264
<i>I.D. I.D.</i>

485
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:44,898
They wouldn't let you in either, huh?

486
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,307
No. I - I lost my wallet.

487
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,404
Well, I gave my fake I.D. to my friend...

488
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,609
and now she's in there partying
while I'm out here.

489
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:56,983
<i>- I.D.
- Do you have a fake I. D?</i>

490
00:30:57,088 --> 00:31:00,251
No. I, uh - I have a real I.D.

491
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,849
- You're 21?
- Two.

492
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:06,226
Wow. Old Man River.

493
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:09,300
<i>Let's move it, people. I.D.</i>

494
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,336
<i>There's an '80s party in the dorms.</i>

495
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:25,245
You have work to do, as do I.

496
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,513
- Sweetie, we shouldn't be out so late.
- I'm going.

497
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,645
- I'll - I'll go.
- You'll go? Great.

498
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:33,747
- You're right.
- What -What dorm?

499
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,187
Think I flew off the handle there?

500
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,264
I think you were fine.

501
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:46,565
Skippy, get me a drink, huh?

502
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,571
Thanks.

503
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:52,943
Ceiling.

504
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,650
Books.

505
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,588
As I Lay Dying.

506
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:11,354
<i>Heart of Darkness.</i>

507
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,490
- Hello.
- Max.

508
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:43,958
When Josie and the Pussycats
were in outer space...

509
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:46,530
what was the name of
the puffy guy who flew?

510
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,032
- Bleep Bleep.
- Great. Thanks.

511
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,795
It was bothering me.

512
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:55,236
- You drunk?
- Yeah.

513
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,365
You got a message
from your ex-girlfriend.

514
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,171
I should call her.

515
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:02,337
Got a quarter for me?

516
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,210
Who's that? Jane 2: Electric Boogaloo?

517
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,809
- Yep.
- Where are you?

518
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:12,389
Nowhere. What are you doing?

519
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,993
- Night.
- Yeah. See ya.

520
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,867
I gotta go.
I gotta sleep with a freshman.

521
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,809
Okay. Me too. Bye-bye.

522
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,615
<i>- Don't you have a roommate?
- No.</i>

523
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:50,251
Oh, my Uncle Lee's a therapist. He wrote
a note and said that I was mentally unstable.

524
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,189
I hope you don't mind
I took my shirt off.

525
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,996
Well, maybe just this once.

526
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:03,233
<i>I really love the blues.</i>

527
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,781
Oh, Amy.

528
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,448
I don't know.
I've been recently widowed.

529
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:22,083
Well, you don't have to worry about anything.
I'm not gonna leave my boyfriend for your-

530
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:28,557
It just seems like a college thing to do.

531
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,870
- Oh.
- Come on.

532
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,567
Be romantically
self-destructive with me.

533
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:49,050
Oh, Amy.

534
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,553
Um, okay. Look.

535
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,750
I'll sleep over,
but I won't sleep with you.

536
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,590
You pussy.

537
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:02,655
Come on, woman.
Why don't you take off your skirt.

538
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,874
Hello, my friend.

539
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:16,970
My little friend.
You do nothing.

540
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,743
Max Belmont does nothing.

541
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:22,752
Oh, Max. Wh-What do you do?

542
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:25,118
Oh, I - I do nothing.

543
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:38,233
<i>- Hey.
- Oh.</i>

544
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:42,238
- Do you know him?
- Stupid freshmen say hi to everybody.

545
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:46,335
- You beat off today?
- Yeah. You?

546
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:48,810
Yeah.

547
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:52,815
You know, I caught myself writing
"go to bed" and "wake up" in my date book...

548
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,885
as if they were two different events.

549
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,826
What kind of job
are you gonna apply for?

550
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:13,097
I don't know. I need the money,
but I'd rather not settle for anything small.

551
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:16,605
We're in Munton.
There is only small in Munton.

552
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,607
- Yeah, but to settle -
- Hey, fellas.

553
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,845
Can't talk. I got class. See you later.

554
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:24,244
Then you need to
make this sound more impressive.

555
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:28,546
This is ridiculous. "Drove a truck"?
I mean, be specific. Why'd you drive a truck?

556
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:30,712
- Delivered cheese.
- What kind of cheese?

557
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:34,222
What do you mean what kind?
I don't know. Gouda. Or Stilton maybe.

558
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,350
That's fancy cheese.
It wasn't American then?

559
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,361
No, I think I delivered foreign cheeses.
I just drove the truck.

560
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:43,092
I realize that, but how about,
"Responsibilities included...

561
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:48,400
"transportation of gourmet cheese products
throughout the metropolitan area"?

562
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,474
Hey. That's nice.

563
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:57,274
Aha! See? You make fun of me,
but there is something going on here.

564
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:04,482
Well, my brother's gay, so I know.

565
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,489
Anyway, um -

566
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,627
Are you going to the rally?

567
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,698
<i>You know, racism spans the globe.</i>

568
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:18,132
From Howard Beach to Crown Heights,
we witness acts of hatred.

569
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,399
What does that mean,
"from Howard Beach to Crown Heights"?

570
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:24,941
That's like from the living room to
the dining room we witness acts of hatred.

571
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,010
Racism spans
from here to the dance floor.

572
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:31,109
So much anger.

573
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:33,740
Could I get you
a Jell-O shot, Miami? Grape.

574
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:37,082
Sure. Why not? I'll try one. Thanks.

575
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,418
<i>Two grapes!</i>

576
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:46,356
Where's Skippy?

577
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,694
You guys all talk alike.

578
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:53,098
Skippy's, um -

579
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:56,935
Says he's doing homework, but I think
he just watches TV and drinks Colt 45.

580
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:00,067
- You know the big ones?
- Yeah. I know 'em.

581
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,914
What's Grover up to?

582
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,678
Well, he'd like us to think
that he's writing a novel...

583
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:12,154
but we all know he just goes out and gallivants
with freshmen women trying to relive Jane.

584
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:14,850
If you'd like my Intro to Psych analysis.

585
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,893
Who'd you take Intro to Psych with?

586
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:19,224
No one. I dated a girl who took it.

587
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:26,899
Look at these fucking people.

588
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:28,995
<i>This sleaze, for instance.</i>

589
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:32,200
<i>"I'm thinking of getting 'I Hate It'
tattooed inside my mouth. "</i>

590
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,371
<i>"I'm the guy that girls like to hug.
The safe guy.</i>

591
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:40,075
"I'll spend a night in a girl's bed,
and nothing will happen.

592
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:42,243
We'll just lie next to
each other and chat. "

593
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,253
<i>And these girls.</i>

594
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,917
<i>"We're both art history majors,
and we're real cute.</i>

595
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:50,425
"But to be perfectly honest with you...

596
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:54,362
anything past Impressionism
kind of leaves us cold. "

597
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:58,925
<i>"Give me a year, and I'll be taken to college
court for date-raping one of these two girls. "</i>

598
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:01,527
<i>And this fool.
Who knows what he's trying to swing.</i>

599
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:05,939
<i>Just another tattoo and motorcycle
Mickey Rourkejerkwad.</i>

600
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,212
And what are you?

601
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,860
Was that the beep?
Uh, hi, Grover. It's me, Jane.

602
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:38,840
How are you? Um, I'm over here right now
futzing around Prague.

603
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:43,107
Um - Always feel like I should say
something important when I call long-distance...

604
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,478
but I don't really have
anything to say right now.

605
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:48,916
Let's see. Um, I was in Poland for a while,
if you tried to reach me.

606
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:52,284
<i>And, uh - Oh. I finally read
War and Peace, which was good.</i>

607
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,620
Like that was a surprise.

608
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,523
And when I was in Poland
I took this trip to Auschwitz.

609
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:59,596
God, I hope this is the right number.

610
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:01,961
That sounds terrible.
"I took a trip to Auschwitz. "

611
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,966
I don't know. Well, bye.

612
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,799
Oh. You'll never believe how bad
American coffee is until you've been over here.

613
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:50,607
Hi. How are you?

614
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:52,545
Grover.

615
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,778
Um, you're gonna think
this is really weird...

616
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:59,822
but I - I did think
that your story was okay.

617
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:02,017
Oh. Well, thanks.

618
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:07,828
Uh, while I'm here, um...

619
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:12,960
I'd just like to respond to
a remark that you made in class yesterday.

620
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:16,164
<i>You know, I couldn't think of
anything clever to say then, but...</i>

621
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:19,436
last night, while I was lying in bed,
I came up with a retort.

622
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:23,707
And when you said that I might be perversely
attracted to your story, I should have responded...

623
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,214
"I'm not attracted to
so many spelling mistakes. "

624
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:32,650
I'm responding to your witticism now.

625
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,691
Fourteen hours after I said it?

626
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,260
Yes.

627
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,397
Uh-huh.

628
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,061
- Oh.
- There you go.

629
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,332
- Thanks.
- I really appreciate you meeting here.

630
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,774
- Uh, I'd have met at my house, but my mom and I had an argument.
- Oh, no problem. Please.

631
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:55,937
She got really angry yesterday.

632
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:58,537
- Um, where should we, um -
- It's your, uh -

633
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:01,209
I think I'm gonna sit here.
I never really sit here.

634
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:04,014
All right.
Well, why don't I sit here?

635
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:07,285
Oh, that's Max's place.

636
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,882
Yeah. I'm feeling kind of surly.

637
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:13,828
Yeah. Speaking of, uh - of surly Max...

638
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:18,561
um, it might be better if we don't ever
mention this book club to Max.

639
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:22,264
Why-Why is that? Are you ashamed
that we're starting a book club?

640
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,568
No, no, no.
Nothing like that. It's just that -

641
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:28,509
You know Max.
He very likely will have an opinion.

642
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:33,649
Yeah.

643
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,278
You're probably right.
Well, shall we begin?

644
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,788
Mmm.

645
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,223
<i>First of all, thank God
we speak fluent Spanish, huh?</i>

646
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:48,026
<i>Geez. Uh, you know what I noticed near the end
of the book, when Grady goes to the prison?</i>

647
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:52,466
<i>That the violence, which has up to then
had a ferocious energy about it...</i>

648
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,800
departed from the emotional
violence and became...

649
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,100
terrifyingly brutal and real.

650
00:42:57,207 --> 00:43:00,665
And particularly after he left the prison,
and he went to find that horse...

651
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:03,713
I found the descriptions
of the horse to be, frankly...

652
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:07,716
astonishingly beautiful,
and yet disturbingly arousing.

653
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:10,082
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- What are your thoughts?</i>

654
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:13,213
Um, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.

655
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:16,225
Um, you are -
You're right on, I think.

656
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:20,229
You really-
You've pinned down the, uh -

657
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:22,458
what it is about the book.

658
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:26,263
Uh, definitely with the -
the prison when, um -

659
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,329
when Grady is, um - does - he's -

660
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,308
There's violence. There's a lot of violence.
And it's like night and day.

661
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,901
<i>And when Grady, uh-</i>

662
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:39,505
<i>He saw all those- those horses,
I think you were saying, um...</i>

663
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,313
and it was... arousing.

664
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:45,183
It was violently arousing.

665
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,793
Otis, have you read this book?

666
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:52,361
Yeah.

667
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,363
<i>- No.
- Oh, please.</i>

668
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,626
Uh - It's just that I've been so busy.

669
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:59,669
I managed to read this entire book
and form a few thoughts about it.

670
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:03,365
If you're not gonna take this seriously,
perhaps we should disband the club now...

671
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,374
before feelings get hurt.

672
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:09,276
No, no, no. No, no, no.
I don't want to - any- any feelings that are -

673
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:12,315
I was remiss in that I - I -

674
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:15,749
I've got my brother
with the mail fraud thing and my-

675
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,555
My mother caught me
authorizing the porn station last night. So -

676
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,559
Ooh.

677
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,892
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to laugh, but -

678
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:30,194
She was angry
like I've never seen her before.

679
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,733
Yeah. Wow.

680
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:38,865
God, you know, I think
I'm gonna blow this job interview off.

681
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:42,503
Oh, no. Otis, please don't.
You obviously need a healthy dose of self-esteem.

682
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:46,379
You need a job. Get out of your mom's home.
Get a job. Please.

683
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:48,508
I know.
But I -What if I don't get it?

684
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:52,180
Well, you shoot for the stars,
and you hit the roof.

685
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:55,053
Yeah.

686
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:58,094
Well, next week?

687
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,494
Next week without - by far-
I mean, this -

688
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:04,726
You know, from your description,
this sounds like a great - great book.

689
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,732
- Who would win? Freddy or Jason?
- Freddy.

690
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:10,773
So you've gotta be ready at all times.

691
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,570
'Cause if the customer
wants to know where a movie is...

692
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:16,271
you've gotta be prepared
to tell him what section it's in.

693
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,280
- Sure.
- Okay. For example...

694
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,782
<i>if I were to say Turner & Hooch,
what would you say?</i>

695
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:24,217
- Comedy.
- Close. We've got a special section for dog pictures.

696
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:26,255
- Dog buddy pictures.
- Oh. I see.

697
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,324
Look at this!

698
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:33,158
<i>Someone put Terms of Endearment
in with prison movies. Earl!</i>

699
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:35,925
That twit. Its supposed to go
in "Terminal Illness. "

700
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:39,692
What are your influences?

701
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:41,703
Um...

702
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:44,365
Samuel Fuller.

703
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:48,309
- All the good ones. All the other ones.
- Yeah. Yeah.

704
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:58,044
Ah, Dad seems fine.

705
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:01,991
Yeah.

706
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:05,459
Well -Well, it's - I don't -
It's hard to tell on the phone.

707
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,463
<i>- Otis.
- Uh-huh.</i>

708
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:10,465
<i>When would be a good time?</i>

709
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:13,035
No, he seems better.
He seems less depressed.

710
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:15,662
<i>Otis?</i>

711
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,936
No. I don't think you ruined his life.
He'll recover.

712
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:22,102
Mm-hmm.

713
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:24,112
<i>- Well, no, listen.
- Me?</i>

714
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:28,446
<i>- I was told to be here for Friday book club to discuss the novel we'd read during the week.
- I don't know.</i>

715
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:31,749
<i>- I'm having trouble focusing. -
Have you even read the book? - Yes!</i>

716
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:35,018
<i>- My mind wanders.
- We'll talk about the book later.</i>

717
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,457
No. Listen. I'm here.
I don't like to waste my time.

718
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:39,461
I'm calm. I'll help you clean up.

719
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:42,498
Tidy's a lifestyle choice.
I like to be of service.

720
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:47,165
- Just pisses me off.
- Why do you keep bringing him here?

721
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:51,503
Well, he's a friend of mine. I think it's -
I think it's good to make new friends.

722
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:53,667
Why do you need more friends?

723
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:57,440
What about me? You got enough friends.
A new one is bad.

724
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:02,244
You start spreading around your affection,
and it runs thin. Believe me.

725
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:05,685
<i>- Since when is there a book club?
- Want to join?</i>

726
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:08,155
- No.
- Your loss.

727
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:14,256
- So that's where that was.
- Yeah. I don't know why I keep packing it.

728
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:18,094
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

729
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:20,170
<i>There's hair all over the floor.</i>

730
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,238
This place is a pigsty.

731
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,911
What's that you're doing?

732
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:34,848
Huh? Oh, I'm, uh, measuring the distance
from the couch to the TV.

733
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:38,547
Uh, Chet said that we've been sitting
a couple inches too close.

734
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:41,089
Don't you find all that television
watching's a waste of time?

735
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:45,423
Of course. But you're doing the crossword, which
is just as much a waste of time, if not a greater one.

736
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:50,466
<i>Yeah, but at least I'm thinking of words
and roots of words and sometimes in Latin.</i>

737
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:53,536
A waste of time, yes.
A bigger waste of time than TV? No.

738
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:57,407
Anyone beat off today?

739
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:02,539
<i>- Hey, Grover. How's your dad?
- That was Mom.</i>

740
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:04,978
Oh. How is Julie?

741
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:07,778
Isn't it bad enough
to be whipped by your own mother...

742
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,479
you have to have this wussy
relationship with Grover's?

743
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:13,078
<i>You are a jackanapes.</i>

744
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:16,421
- A jackanapes!
- Jackanapes.

745
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:20,553
Can we skip the pleasantries
and finish our conversation, Mr. Book Club?

746
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:22,894
Lay off the book club.
I watch TV with a critical eye.

747
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,969
If I get truly sucked in,
I know it's time to change the channel.

748
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:29,505
<i>"Is it abbreviated?" "Is it plural?"
These are the questions I have to ask myself.</i>

749
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:33,337
- Max, can I ask you a question? - Your attention
span is, like, one-quarter of a music video.

750
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:35,411
There are many dull parts in the videos.

751
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:38,777
<i>- Max, did you screw Miami?
- What?</i>

752
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:42,811
- Otis?
- I thought he knew.

753
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,151
<i>No, I just told you...
out of guilt.</i>

754
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:50,420
We've developed such a weak, pathetic familiarity
that talking to you is like talking to myself.

755
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:53,758
I think the operative words in this situation
are "weak" and "pathetic. "

756
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:56,765
What are we supposed to do
with this information? I don't want it.

757
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,858
Well, then give it back.

758
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:01,870
And stop looking at me, Chet.
I can see he's judging me.

759
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:05,669
Stop judging me!
Put the broom down! Stop cleaning!

760
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,677
Well, you'll do what you wanna do.
But Skippy is your fr-

761
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,247
Shut up!

762
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:13,316
Max.

763
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,920
How was she?

764
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:32,567
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

765
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:35,763
It's just, you gave me a black cup.
I can't drink from a black cup.

766
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:37,772
Huh.

767
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:41,275
It's just too much black. See, I -
All that black, I can't see the coffee.

768
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:43,744
I like to see what I'm drinking.

769
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:48,406
Yeah.

770
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:51,282
I don't like raisins.

771
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:54,755
It's so funny, because my mother,
she used to make me eat them...

772
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:57,520
even though she knew
that I hated them.

773
00:49:57,627 --> 00:50:00,255
And then she - she -

774
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:05,335
The end.

775
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,695
Fifty cents.

776
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:12,036
- What's this?
- For my raisin story.

777
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:15,009
When I tell a bad story,
I like to pay people for their time.

778
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:18,275
No, I liked it. It was good.
It was short, but I liked it.

779
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,282
Especially the part about your mother.

780
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,682
- Really? You did?
- Yeah.

781
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:25,277
I'll just -
I'll take a quarter.

782
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:31,859
Do you, uh...

783
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:33,896
want that?

784
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:38,868
No, no. That's -That's okay.

785
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,937
That's -

786
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:45,800
My parents -

787
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:48,810
They still come and visit me
after four years.

788
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:50,812
You'd think they'd be sick of it.

789
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:53,405
- Your parents still together?
- You know.

790
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:55,314
Ooh.

791
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,683
- What are you writing?
- I don't know.

792
00:50:57,788 --> 00:51:03,249
I've always thought that my parents were part
of the trickle-down method of parenting...

793
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,761
like a reflection on the Reagan years -
look good to a lot of people.

794
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:10,424
But, basically, I'm paying
for all that neglect now.

795
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:15,896
I guess my parents have sort of
a Lyndon Johnson feel to them...

796
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:18,839
like there's no satisfactory reason
why they became parents...

797
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:20,842
like my real parents
were assassinated...

798
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:24,675
<i>and these people
just were next in line for the job.</i>

799
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:30,151
I don't know. They fight a lot,
but they'll never split.

800
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:33,188
Wish this year
would last forever sometimes.

801
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,258
I know.

802
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:44,132
<i>All right, listen,
can I talk to you-</i>

803
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:47,795
Listen, mister, don't even start with me,
because this has been the worst day.

804
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:49,872
Join the club.

805
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:53,109
<i>- Bonjour, Max.</i>

806
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:59,843
I can't believe I'm doing this. I hated the food
when I went here. Now I'm back by choice.

807
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,442
- What can I get for you?
- Can I get some more pasta and a potato, please?

808
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:06,113
Sorry. I can't give you both.
One entrée per person.

809
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:08,384
Potato is an entrée?

810
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:12,121
- Yep. It's all some people eat around here.
- Since when is potato an entrée?

811
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:14,493
When I went here you could get
two potatoes, sometimes, and an entrée.

812
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:17,965
Well, things have changed, you know.
Cutbacks.

813
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:22,995
Couldn't you just
bend the rules a bit...

814
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:25,074
Kate?

815
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,377
I'm sorry. I can't.

816
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:33,108
I'm not a student here.
This is my job. I could get fired.

817
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:41,022
Aren't you Grover's friend?

818
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:43,024
Yeah.

819
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:45,094
Oh. You're the girl.

820
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:47,857
- This is your job.
- It's my job.

821
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:50,262
Kate. Max.

822
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:03,278
- So, what can I get for ya?
- Can I get another potato, Kate?

823
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,348
Sure.

824
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:29,204
Hi.

825
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:32,207
Uh, it's me.
I feel really stupid calling again.

826
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:36,302
I wish someone would just
pick up or call or something.

827
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:40,349
Max, are you there?
Are you doing a crossword?

828
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:44,580
I have this fear that you're all around
the machine giggling or something.

829
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:49,158
Grover...

830
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,394
I just wanted to tell you that I -

831
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:00,431
This is gonna be a tight year.

832
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:04,633
The separation is costing
a lot more than I had anticipated.

833
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:10,335
You know, Ellen has this property.

834
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:12,347
Car's still there?

835
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:15,646
Yeah. I'd feel more comfortable
if we sat by the window...

836
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,220
so I could keep an eye on it.

837
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:20,448
How's Jane?

838
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:23,651
- Still in Czechoslovakia.
- You mean the Czech Republic.

839
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,660
<i>Yeah, I guess I do.</i>

840
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:28,492
Well, Czech or Slovakia.
Gotta read the newspapers, Grover.

841
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:32,694
In college I didn't get much chance
to read up on things.

842
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:36,706
Why aren't you with her?

843
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:43,572
- Is that everything you own?
- Yeah, except for some stuff I got in storage.

844
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,740
- Do you have any more cheese?
- Just Cheez Whiz, actually.

845
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,818
- That's okay.
- All right.

846
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:54,923
I started to run.

847
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:57,493
Then I threw out my back.

848
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:00,730
Beautiful campus here.

849
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:07,934
So, I've been thinking of things
to help you write...

850
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:10,506
to unblock.

851
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:14,703
I liked that one story you sent me last year,
the one about you and your mother.

852
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:19,009
Oh, would you tell your mother that we still
have to settle the telephone bill from last May?

853
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:21,310
Yeah, sure.

854
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:26,321
I'll bet if your math grades had been higher,
you probably could have gotten into Brown.

855
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:33,428
So, I'm moving in with Ellen.

856
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:37,057
She's got this lovely property
in Oyster Bay.

857
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:41,263
Beautiful grounds.
Right on the ocean. Grotto pool.

858
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:43,271
So you're officially divorced?

859
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:46,365
No. Legally separated.

860
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:50,105
Divorce would be
a little expensive for us right now.

861
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:54,515
I think the fact that you
were still going to school...

862
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:56,517
sort of kept us together.

863
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:59,520
Yeah?
Well, good, I guess.

864
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:01,988
It's tough - It's tough...

865
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:04,526
as I'm sure you know,
dating women.

866
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:06,527
Mm-hmm.

867
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:10,759
Before Ellen, right after your mother,
I went to bed with a woman. She was -

868
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:14,769
Dad, I'm not really ready to accept you
as a human being yet.

869
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,772
The idea of you and Mom is disgusting enough.
But you and another woman -

870
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:21,469
I mean, I'm 56 years old
and I gotta start using condoms again.

871
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:23,478
- Dad. Dad, stop.
- It's crazy.

872
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:26,481
By the time you get it out of the package,
you lose your erection.

873
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,551
Dad, Dad, Dad!

874
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,021
Sorry.

875
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:37,617
It's just, making adjustments to living
without your mother is wearing on me.

876
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:40,787
I have to work at my adjustments.

877
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,798
I think your mother's
better at it than I am.

878
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,300
She seems to be okay.
Is that right?

879
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,963
Yeah. She seems good.

880
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:52,735
But from what I can tell,
this is pretty much her decision.

881
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:54,742
Yeah.

882
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:56,812
I hate to compromise.

883
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:00,249
Find a balance.

884
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:10,320
Ah, here's my fancy rental car.

885
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,895
Got a good deal on it though.

886
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,323
Anyway, I was thinking that, uh...

887
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:20,130
maybe you'd be interested in
moving into my apartment in the Village.

888
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:24,605
There's a really nice coffee shop on the corner-
a lot of writers and artists.

889
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:27,540
Until you're ready
to get on your feet.

890
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:30,670
I'm not really too into
the coffeehouse thing.

891
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,180
It's stupid.

892
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,911
Well, you don't have to go there.

893
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:39,648
I'll leave the cable in.
You'll get all the Knick games.

894
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:43,954
It'd only be until next summer, though,
'cause I'd like to rent it by then.

895
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:47,995
<i>Ellen used to work at the New Yorker...</i>

896
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:51,396
and I'll bet she could get you an internship
or something if you're interested.

897
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:54,231
Yeah.
That actually sounds kinda nice.

898
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,677
Ellen really likes you.

899
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,390
I don't wear jeans a lot.

900
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:18,793
I don't feel comfortable in jeans.

901
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:22,661
- So, wanna take my car or yours?
- I don't have a car. I don't drive.

902
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:25,734
- So, you wanna take mine?
- Yeah, that sounds good.

903
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:44,749
You know, I was thinking, uh...

904
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:47,584
maybe you should apply
to graduate school in California.

905
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:52,423
- I've always wanted to go there.
- Why don't you apply to grad school in California?

906
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,019
Or that.

907
00:58:56,332 --> 00:59:00,200
I don't know about things, Jack.

908
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:02,533
What don't you know?

909
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:09,135
Can we, uh, just admit some lies that
we may have told each other?

910
00:59:09,245 --> 00:59:12,271
Oh, God. What a question.

911
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:16,851
<i>What?</i>

912
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:19,421
I'm gonna write it down.

913
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:27,728
What?

914
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,798
<i>Throw me the Sharpie.</i>

915
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:33,736
Thanks.

916
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,816
I don't know what to do.

917
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,121
I'm sorry.

918
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:03,664
<i>It was weeks ago.
It was at the Hole, and-</i>

919
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:07,065
I have a tremendous heat
running through my body.

920
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:12,631
- Look at this suckwad.
- Wh-What are you doing?

921
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:16,872
Hey, joker, get out of my spot!

922
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:20,313
What's your fuckin' problem, you suck-ass?
We were here first!

923
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:24,409
<i>Hey, jerkwad, get out of my spot!</i>

924
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,114
Get! Get, you motherf-

925
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:29,953
This is fine, Kate.
Let's just park here.

926
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:31,959
This is good.

927
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:35,656
<i>You wanna fight me? You wanna fight me?
I'll break your fuckin' legs!</i>

928
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:38,632
<i>I'm gonna break your fuckin legs.</i>

929
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,868
I'm gonna break his fuckin' legs.
Bet he kills Bambi.

930
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:47,500
I'm gonna smash that car
and I'm gonna break your fuckin' legs!

931
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:50,511
<i>- Hey, suckwad, gonna get out? Think you're so tough?
- This shouldn't be done.</i>

932
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:52,638
This guy would rather be bow hunting.

933
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:55,843
Don't upset him, because
he'd already rather be bow hunting...

934
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:57,920
and any additional aggravation -

935
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:03,258
Chickenshit!

936
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,569
He left.

937
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,639
Yeah.

938
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:24,639
You make me sad, Skippy.

939
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:31,144
You know, this big idea about you learning
and coming back to school...

940
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:33,154
and - Mmm -

941
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:35,156
taking all of these classes.

942
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:38,159
You haven't done a stitch of reading
since you've been here.

943
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:41,753
You get on my case about my studies.

944
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:45,129
<i>- I mean, really!
- God, I begged you to stay on Prozac.</i>

945
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:48,226
<i>You used me to come back to school.
That's what you did.</i>

946
01:01:48,337 --> 01:01:50,771
<i>'Cause I could care less
about your stupid classes.</i>

947
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:54,206
Is G.I. Joe a safe doll
to give kids at Christmas?

948
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:57,279
What's the effect
of TV weathermen on society?

949
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,076
<i>My classes?
Let's talk about your classes. Okay?</i>

950
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:03,084
Your dinosaur classes
and all that shit.

951
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:05,086
Let's talk about your friends.

952
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:08,214
Let's talk about how you guys
are all in love with each other...

953
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:11,816
and how sick you make me
with your stupid games, those trivia games.

954
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:15,455
Ding! Max loves Grover.
Ding! Skippy does Otis.

955
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,965
Ding! They all do each other
and - and -

956
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,967
It drives me nuts!

957
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:23,266
Ding that, Skippy.
Get a fucking life.

958
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:26,000
Nice dime-store psychoanalysis.

959
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:29,010
You know what?
I can't stand you.

960
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:33,139
<i>I can't stand... that.
You know?</i>

961
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:38,585
Your shoes, your pants,
that shirt you're wearing, your hair.

962
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:40,588
Your hair drives me crazy.

963
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:43,090
Just get out. Okay?

964
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:46,650
I have homework to do.
Just get out.

965
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,254
<i>Get out!</i>

966
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:51,265
<i>- Get out.</i>

967
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:54,598
Out. Out.

968
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:57,036
<i>Go.</i>

969
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,835
<i>Go.</i>

970
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:01,307
Out.

971
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:06,778
You got nice eaves
on your house there.

972
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:09,943
"Eaves"?
You do the crossword too, huh?

973
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:12,020
Yeah.

974
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,056
Well, I had a nice time.

975
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:20,129
Yeah.

976
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:24,398
You know,
tomorrow's my birthday.

977
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,400
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

978
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:30,029
That's terrible. That's just the worst.
Now I won't know what to get you.

979
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:34,075
If I get you a big gift, it looks like
I'm overcompensating and coming on too strong.

980
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:36,077
If I get you something small...

981
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:37,840
I look cheap.

982
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:42,145
I've inherited a tragedy. It's like
a venereal disease, a birthday at this point.

983
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:47,188
You know, I don't know why
everything is so glum with ya at first.

984
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:50,521
Potatoes, parking...

985
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:52,526
toppings on pizza.

986
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:55,028
I like birthdays.

987
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:57,929
I'm gonna be 17 tomorrow,
and I like that.

988
01:03:58,034 --> 01:03:59,934
Seventeen.

989
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:01,936
Wow.

990
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:04,939
<i>So, now you can read
Seventeen magazine...</i>

991
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:06,941
and finally get
all the references.

992
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:09,034
So it's not so bad.

993
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:12,740
I wanna be older.
And it's not a disease.

994
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:16,616
Well, may you see 17 more.

995
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:32,301
I'll only go to first
with you tonight.

996
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:12,500
<i>"My backpack is filled with misfortune
and my boots filled with sorrow...</i>

997
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:14,576
- Oh, fuck.
- for the adolescent country-"

998
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:19,009
"Bleeding cactus. "

999
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,885
In or out!

1000
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,159
- Ow! Ow.
- You okay?

1001
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:35,253
Yeah. Uh, listen,
do you have something?

1002
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:37,264
Protection, I mean.

1003
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:41,666
I know that's a silly question, but, um -

1004
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,830
In my- Uh, hold on.

1005
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,908
Where are my pants?

1006
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,310
Ow.

1007
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:59,677
- No. No. I don't have my wallet.
- Oh, no.

1008
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:02,690
Audra, are you still awake?

1009
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:05,192
No!

1010
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:07,694
Do you have any condoms?

1011
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:09,697
Oh, let me see.

1012
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:13,565
You should really be more prepared, "Groden. "

1013
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:21,839
Look, I hate to put you through
all this trouble for a silly little condom.

1014
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:25,380
No - No, we -
We'll find something.

1015
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,676
I'm gonna look
for my wallet in the hall.

1016
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:30,946
<i>Oh, man! Aww.</i>

1017
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:33,681
Well, maybe you
left your wallet at home.

1018
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:36,986
Here's a condom.
Uh, might be a little old.

1019
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:38,993
The fucking bong.

1020
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:41,495
Oh, monkey!

1021
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:52,239
Grover, I need to know
if you're gonna stay in my apartment.

1022
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:54,741
Otherwise, I'll rent it.
Call me.

1023
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:58,177
Knicks in trouble.

1024
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,010
<i>Zach, do you have
Dr. Giggles letterboxed?</i>

1025
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:04,450
"Insane Doctors,"
right next to "Interesting Failures. "

1026
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:06,521
Yes!

1027
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:12,225
Aha. This bastard wasn't kind,
didn't rewind...

1028
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:14,728
and now, mister, you'll get fined.

1029
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:18,231
When I make my movie, they're gonna have
a hell of a time finding a category for it.

1030
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:20,234
- Did I tell you about my movie?
- Yes.

1031
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:22,236
Well, it's changed a little bit.

1032
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:25,739
Now it's about this guy who lives
with his mother, and they sort of fall in love.

1033
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:27,809
<i>It's real, uh, shocking,
you know, like Lolita.</i>

1034
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:31,607
<i>- They weren't blood relations in Lolita.
- Well, see, I'm doing something different then.</i>

1035
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:34,615
<i>And I'm playing with gender roles.</i>

1036
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,617
Probably put it in "Offbeat. "

1037
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:39,119
<i>- Or way offbeat.
- See? You're shocked.</i>

1038
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,621
All right, have this back
by Tuesday night.

1039
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,625
<i>- You've got a delinquent Mystic Pizza.
- Okay, whatever.</i>

1040
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:48,629
See, you're shocked.
They'd have to invent a section for my movie.

1041
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,632
That'll be cool, huh,
when I make my movie...

1042
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,634
and it comes out on video.

1043
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,966
You and I could see who rents it.

1044
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,973
We could probably sit here
and watch it on the TV.

1045
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:03,478
So you plan on still working here
even after you make a motion picture.

1046
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:06,070
True.
I may not be here then.

1047
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:08,343
There is a certainly laughability
to Kant.

1048
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:12,785
Sure, he's valuable in certain ways,
but you gotta admit there's a laughability to him.

1049
01:08:12,888 --> 01:08:17,052
<i>Is it me, or does "Bankrupt" come up
more often on Wheel of Fortune now?</i>

1050
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:20,492
- I think I see you as Braque to my Picasso.
- Yes!

1051
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:24,054
<i>Would you rather be buried,
cremated or eaten by crows?</i>

1052
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:28,335
I think I'd rather be cremated.

1053
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:30,871
Okay, can you name me 10 European capitals?

1054
01:08:30,973 --> 01:08:33,271
- Ding, ding! Holland. England.
- Uh, Madrid.

1055
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:35,275
England?

1056
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:37,777
Skippy, what kind of a triv master
are you, anyway?

1057
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,611
- Chet, you wanna ding in?
- No, sir. At my age I find trivia too exhausting.

1058
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:44,982
<i>Okay, I'll go. Name me all nine
of the Friday the 13th movies.</i>

1059
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:46,987
- Ding!
- Otis dinged first. Otis dinged first.

1060
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:48,989
<i>Okay, Friday the 13th 1-
Just Friday the 13th.</i>

1061
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:51,423
<i>Friday the 13th 2,
Friday the 13th 3 in 3-D...</i>

1062
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:53,427
<i>four, The Final Chapter,
five, A New Beginning...</i>

1063
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:55,690
<i>uh, seven is The New Blood,
eight is Jason Takes Manhattan...</i>

1064
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,698
<i>- nine is Jason Goes to Hell-
- Tick. Tick.</i>

1065
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,200
<i>What the hell is six?
Uh, Jason Sucks Some Cock.</i>

1066
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:01,894
- No. Max.
- Time is up.

1067
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:04,700
<i>- I'm pretty sure it's Jason Sucks Some Cock.
- No. Max.</i>

1068
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,707
<i>- Jason Kills.
- That's it. That's it.</i>

1069
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:09,710
<i>- There's no Jason Kills.
- Somethin' like that. We'll give it to him anyway.</i>

1070
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:12,212
- You'll give it to him anyway?
- Name six TV shows from movies.

1071
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:15,374
- Ding! Ding!
- You shouldn't even be triv master. You're not one of us.

1072
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:19,887
<i>Jason Kills is an idiotic title. Jason kills
in every one of those suck-wind movies.</i>

1073
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,583
- Do you want me to take his points back?
- Yes. Take his points back.

1074
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:24,659
<i>- There is no Jason Kills?
- No.</i>

1075
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:28,093
<i>- Was Uncle Buck a TV show? - Yes.
- Will you shut up for a second?</i>

1076
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:30,427
<i>It's not Jason Kills.</i>

1077
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:33,001
<i>- Is it?
- It's Jason Lives.</i>

1078
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:35,002
<i>Ah! Jason Lives.</i>

1079
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:38,471
- Who the fuck cares what Jason does?
- You started this.

1080
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:41,771
<i>- Look at us.
- Hey, was Charles in Charge a movie?</i>

1081
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:44,778
<i>- No.
- I quit. You're all a bunch of media slaves.</i>

1082
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,178
<i>I hate this game show shit.</i>

1083
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:51,219
Kate...

1084
01:09:52,388 --> 01:09:56,688
I'm having a sl-slight
nervous breakdown right now.

1085
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:58,851
Would you mind...

1086
01:09:58,961 --> 01:10:00,929
excusing yourself, please?

1087
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:07,731
I took back his points.

1088
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:09,804
Thank you.

1089
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:15,570
This is all conversational blue balls.

1090
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:19,512
Calm down. Somebody woke up
on the wrong side of the futon this morning.

1091
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:22,516
You should talk.
You're the biggest wet blanket of us all.

1092
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:25,883
<i>- Worst influence on anyone.
- I'm going home.</i>

1093
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:29,446
You're not going anywhere. None of us.
We're gonna stay at school forever.

1094
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,287
<i>- Shut up, Skippy.
- Leave Skippy alone.</i>

1095
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:34,294
Leave Skippy alone? That's his role.
That's what we like about Skippy.

1096
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:37,297
We like to kick him around
and make fun of him. That's the norm.

1097
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:40,300
- Then it's a bad habit.
- This is all just habit.

1098
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:44,236
These drinks we're drinking. Scotch.
You smoke like a chimney, Grover.

1099
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,831
Affectations that become habits.

1100
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:50,935
You're no different than us. We stay
together out of fear. That's all we know.

1101
01:10:51,046 --> 01:10:54,413
Then we should adjust and treat him better.
He's not a child.

1102
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:58,282
Max, you just accept everything,
like it'll go on like this.

1103
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:01,388
I'm 22.

1104
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:05,324
- When I'm 42 you'll be 42, and Otis'll be 42.
- Thanks.

1105
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:09,193
That's interesting. Of course,
my birthday is in a month, so I'll be 43, but -

1106
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:12,199
You know what I mean.
We all know what we mean.

1107
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:14,701
Just leave Skippy be.
He's not a child.

1108
01:11:14,803 --> 01:11:17,795
Max is an asshole, but he's right.

1109
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:20,807
<i>What?
I'm defending you, you idiot.</i>

1110
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:24,811
This crap is all just a symptom of the pressures
the Hawks have put upon themselves -

1111
01:11:24,913 --> 01:11:26,813
Thought we were the Cougars.

1112
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:29,816
<i>- Cougars, Hawks, Jerk-offs- Who gives a fuck?
- Jerk-offs.</i>

1113
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:32,819
<i>It's a symptom of the pressures
we put upon ourselves to remain friends...</i>

1114
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:36,618
in this non-unnatural environment,
liberal arts bullshit.

1115
01:11:36,725 --> 01:11:39,853
<i>- I'm not prepared!
- Hey, is everything all right here?</i>

1116
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,531
Soon we're gonna all start
backstabbing one another.

1117
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:46,533
Skippy.

1118
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:48,535
I know.

1119
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:50,537
You and Miami.

1120
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:54,200
- I slept with her.
- Yeah, I know. She told me.

1121
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,801
And Grover told me too.

1122
01:11:56,912 --> 01:11:58,880
And Otis told me also.

1123
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:02,910
I didn't say a word.

1124
01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:05,384
Well, aren't we all good friends.

1125
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:08,388
Although Miami said
she slept with Max...

1126
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,515
<i>and three of you say
Max slept with her.</i>

1127
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:12,651
<i>- I don't know who to believe.
- I am sorry.</i>

1128
01:12:12,761 --> 01:12:14,661
We were both just there.

1129
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:18,529
It was just a thing.
I'm not -And there's Kate.

1130
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:20,932
Yeah.

1131
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:22,936
I hate you.

1132
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:25,097
Essentially, we're not friends.

1133
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:28,199
Basically, you're a fuckhead.

1134
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:31,806
As of now -

1135
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:35,179
Wait till the second hand
passes the five -

1136
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:38,913
There. As of now,
our friendship is done.

1137
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:41,489
It's official. It's finished.

1138
01:13:08,183 --> 01:13:10,481
Hi.

1139
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:13,487
<i>- I was just walking by-
- Hold it. Hold it. Just -</i>

1140
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:17,150
I'm having... one of those... times...

1141
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:20,626
<i>where my name
sounds very weird to me.</i>

1142
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:25,633
My name is Jane. Jane.

1143
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:31,635
It all sounds so foreign to me, you know.

1144
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:34,140
This is really where
you like to hang out, huh?

1145
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:38,304
Yeah. I like to come here
and get away from the school...

1146
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,314
think about graduation.

1147
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:43,317
Plus, Chet lets me listen to talk radio.

1148
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,478
<i>I'm just addicted to it.</i>

1149
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:47,487
This is a townie bar.

1150
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:51,719
You know, these little things
that people have as pets called dogs. Right?

1151
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:55,063
You know, dogs...

1152
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:59,067
cantaloupe.

1153
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:03,004
We eat cantaloupe.

1154
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,740
What are you talking about?

1155
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:10,141
<i>These- These things- These things
that-that-that we take for granted-</i>

1156
01:14:10,245 --> 01:14:12,145
they're just -
they're all so weird.

1157
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:15,978
These words, these -
these names.

1158
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,713
Jane. Jane.

1159
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:22,923
Grover.

1160
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:26,153
Gro... ver.

1161
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:28,161
What are you drinking?

1162
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:30,390
<i>- Scotch.
- Yikes.</i>

1163
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:33,701
Chet.

1164
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:37,295
Chet.

1165
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:46,380
They only play country music on this jukebox.

1166
01:14:54,122 --> 01:14:56,090
I'm a little drunk.

1167
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:35,562
<i>- You okay?
- I'm fine.</i>

1168
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:41,264
Well, I'm hammered.

1169
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:44,430
I mean, I'm hiding it very well.
I'm aware of that.

1170
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,940
But I'm pretty soused.

1171
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,942
Can you tell?

1172
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:51,569
<i>- No.
- Come on!</i>

1173
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:55,773
Well, yeah.
I mean, when you were at the bar.

1174
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:58,944
You were saying "diaphragm"
instead of "diploma. "

1175
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:00,954
<i>- Other than that, no.</i>

1176
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:04,424
What about me?

1177
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:08,462
No. I had no idea.
You seem fine.

1178
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:11,556
<i>When you called Chet "Daddy,"
I thought that's who he was.</i>

1179
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:14,636
Your daddy.

1180
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:20,639
Shit. I gotta be at my therapist
in five minutes.

1181
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:24,303
What do I do,
being at my therapist drunk?

1182
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,381
How awful.

1183
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:05,909
You know, despite my efforts,
my intense efforts to do nothing...

1184
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:08,387
things happen anyway.

1185
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:11,391
Like?

1186
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:14,326
I'm embarrassed to say. I just -

1187
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:17,330
I didn't want to have any attachments
at school my senior year.

1188
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:19,332
You know, graduation and all.

1189
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:21,493
Yeah. Me too.

1190
01:17:21,603 --> 01:17:23,503
I just hope...

1191
01:17:23,605 --> 01:17:25,505
that we both...

1192
01:17:25,607 --> 01:17:27,598
feel this way after today.

1193
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:29,609
After we leave this moment.

1194
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:33,078
I hope that
after the alcohol wears off...

1195
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:35,081
you go talk to your shrink...

1196
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:38,311
and I go back to my friends...

1197
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:40,854
I just hope we keep this.

1198
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:45,859
It's not really
as dramatic as all that.

1199
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:48,361
I mean, we've got some time.

1200
01:17:48,463 --> 01:17:50,431
It's a long life.

1201
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:55,468
Hey, what if we did have a love affair?

1202
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:57,561
Do you think it'd really last?

1203
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,643
That's a good attitude.

1204
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:13,219
<i>Right.</i>

1205
01:18:13,321 --> 01:18:16,222
<i>I feel really stupid calling again.</i>

1206
01:18:16,324 --> 01:18:20,351
<i>I wish someone would just pick up
or call or something.</i>

1207
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:23,090
<i>Max, are you there?</i>

1208
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:25,098
<i>Are you doing a crossword?</i>

1209
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:28,795
<i>I have this fear that you're all around
the machine giggling or something.</i>

1210
01:18:31,473 --> 01:18:33,441
<i>Grover...</i>

1211
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:36,643
<i>I just wanted to, uh-</i>

1212
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:47,047
<i>Hi. Uh, it's me.</i>

1213
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:49,350
<i>I feel really stupid calling again.</i>

1214
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:53,087
<i>I wish someone would just pick up
or call or something.</i>

1215
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:55,095
<i>Max, are you there?</i>

1216
01:18:55,197 --> 01:18:57,324
<i>Are you doing a crossword?</i>

1217
01:18:57,432 --> 01:19:01,391
<i>I have this fear that you're all
around the machine giggling or something.</i>

1218
01:19:04,206 --> 01:19:06,174
Grover...

1219
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:11,903
I just wanted to tell you that -
that I miss you.

1220
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:31,263
She's really happy, her new professor's terrific,
and he's very encouraging of her writing.

1221
01:19:34,035 --> 01:19:36,003
She stopped calling me.

1222
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:38,938
I thought about calling her.

1223
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,133
Just seems like
a lot to do, you know?

1224
01:19:41,243 --> 01:19:44,144
She's so far.
That long-distance code is so long.

1225
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:46,942
- It's long.
- It's really long.

1226
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:49,016
I'm not there.

1227
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:53,453
Do you plan to leave here ever?

1228
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:56,319
Why would I leave?

1229
01:19:56,424 --> 01:19:58,324
I don't know.

1230
01:19:58,426 --> 01:20:02,362
You know, I sold term papers
to make a living...

1231
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:05,558
and slept with undergraduates,
the whole deal.

1232
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:10,627
After my seventh or eighth year,
I began to feel like I was using myself.

1233
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:15,039
Somehow I experienced my time
as a postponement of my life...

1234
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:19,580
<i>but eventually I just realized
that this is my life.</i>

1235
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:21,945
I could see getting used to it.

1236
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:27,454
I met a woman - my third American History
of the 20th Century professor.

1237
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:29,547
- We had this child.
- Nice.

1238
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:33,059
<i>That is nice. It's nice.</i>

1239
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:35,721
But it's not for everyone.

1240
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:39,767
Some people need to have
a real career...

1241
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:42,769
which is something
that I've never really understood -

1242
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:46,967
why someone would want to be
a vet or a lawyer...

1243
01:20:47,075 --> 01:20:49,475
or a filmmaker.

1244
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:51,478
I'm paraphrasing myself here...

1245
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:54,413
but I am a student...

1246
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:56,984
and that's what I chose.

1247
01:20:57,085 --> 01:21:00,953
You might need to choose
something else, and that's -

1248
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:07,961
I like that you drink.

1249
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:09,963
I like a bartender who drinks.

1250
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:12,056
Otherwise I feel like
I'm being poisoned.

1251
01:21:13,668 --> 01:21:16,102
Here's a joke.

1252
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:18,672
How do you make God laugh?

1253
01:21:19,941 --> 01:21:21,909
How?

1254
01:21:23,945 --> 01:21:25,913
Make a plan.

1255
01:21:45,033 --> 01:21:47,001
<i>Now arriving at Gate 4B-</i>

1256
01:21:47,102 --> 01:21:51,004
Oh, God.

1257
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:53,870
My mother put mayonnaise on this.

1258
01:21:53,975 --> 01:21:57,035
This thing is swimming in mayonnaise.

1259
01:21:57,145 --> 01:22:00,444
I could get really sick if I don't
get this refrigerated soon. Isn't that right?

1260
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:04,314
Absolutely.
Warm mayonnaise only means trouble.

1261
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:10,014
So, we'll see you when?
Spring break?

1262
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:12,025
Yeah.

1263
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:14,027
What?

1264
01:22:14,129 --> 01:22:16,029
N- No.

1265
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:19,498
I think it might be better
if I stayed till summer.

1266
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:24,838
Oh. God, I'm antsy times four.

1267
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:27,101
- Bye, Otis.
- Oh.

1268
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:29,802
Bye, Kate.

1269
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,915
Max is gonna miss you.

1270
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:38,646
<i>Boy. High school.</i>

1271
01:22:38,753 --> 01:22:42,018
I miss that like a bitch now too.

1272
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:44,091
Okay.

1273
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:54,090
<i>Flight 25 from Buffalo
is now arriving at Gate 8A.</i>

1274
01:22:57,005 --> 01:22:58,973
Thanks.

1275
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:03,041
Okay.
Just get this over with.

1276
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:09,915
Look at the baby!

1277
01:23:10,018 --> 01:23:13,419
I'll give you $400 if you go in
the duty-free shop with no pants on...

1278
01:23:13,521 --> 01:23:16,922
and start yelling,
"Look at me! Look at me!"

1279
01:23:17,025 --> 01:23:19,926
Hey, Otis said you applied for a job
in the philosophy department.

1280
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:21,928
- Did he say that?
- Mmm.

1281
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:23,930
Well, then it must be true.

1282
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:27,126
Kate might take some time off after school
and we might get a place.

1283
01:23:27,235 --> 01:23:30,136
Oh, and there's the prom.

1284
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:32,866
- Don't make fun.
- I didn't make fun.

1285
01:23:32,974 --> 01:23:35,101
- I got my tuxedo.
- Bye, baby.

1286
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:40,609
<i>Attention, Flight 426. There is a gate change.</i>

1287
01:23:40,715 --> 01:23:43,741
<i>Flight 426 to Boston...</i>

1288
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,946
<i>now boarding at Gate 2.</i>

1289
01:23:47,055 --> 01:23:49,853
<i>Again, a gate change-</i>

1290
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:52,927
Shit.
I wish I hadn't noticed that.

1291
01:24:00,135 --> 01:24:03,036
I think my scarf looks terrific.

1292
01:24:03,138 --> 01:24:05,038
Gimme some sugar.

1293
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:07,108
That's high-speed.

1294
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:13,906
Get your tongue
out of my mouth, little girl.

1295
01:24:17,552 --> 01:24:19,952
They're not some invention.

1296
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:21,955
You know, a bunch of guys -

1297
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:32,692
Yeah, it is.
14D. There you go.

1298
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:35,395
- Thank you.
- Have a safe flight.

1299
01:24:35,503 --> 01:24:37,630
Are there any flights to Prague?

1300
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:40,799
Uh, we have a shuttle that goes
to international terminals.

1301
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:45,505
Then you change for Paris,
and change there for Prague.

1302
01:24:45,613 --> 01:24:48,343
And the shuttle, uh, I-leaves when?

1303
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:50,350
In an hour.

1304
01:24:51,386 --> 01:24:53,513
Put me on it.

1305
01:24:53,621 --> 01:24:56,283
I'm sorry, sir.
That flight's all booked.

1306
01:24:57,725 --> 01:25:01,855
Everybody else in America has been to Prague.
What's the big deal, you send one extra?

1307
01:25:03,164 --> 01:25:05,064
I'm sorry.

1308
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:08,067
You see, I've been needing to go there
for a long time now.

1309
01:25:08,169 --> 01:25:12,071
I mean, there's Czech and Slovakia
and a big Jewish cemetery...

1310
01:25:12,173 --> 01:25:14,403
and the opera house and -

1311
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:17,478
Maybe that's Vienna where the opera house is.
But that's nearby, you know.

1312
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:19,638
Given the opportunity,
I'd hit Vienna too.

1313
01:25:19,747 --> 01:25:22,716
Hell, I'd do all of Europe,
given a chance.

1314
01:25:23,918 --> 01:25:27,479
I can imagine Jane and some Praguian idiot
dancing the night away.

1315
01:25:27,589 --> 01:25:29,489
A horrible image.

1316
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:32,253
And the coffee -
See, all I know is American coffee.

1317
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,590
Or the beer.
Whatever's good over there.

1318
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:37,096
It's gotta all be better over there.

1319
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:39,632
And nothing I eat has any taste.

1320
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:42,168
This has been such a strange time.

1321
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:45,171
I wonder, if I was there now,
how would things be different.

1322
01:25:45,273 --> 01:25:49,107
Isn't there a big bridge with statues on it?

1323
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:52,338
I seem to remember that
from a history class.

1324
01:25:52,447 --> 01:25:55,007
<i>Jane and some guy
kissing on the bridge...</i>

1325
01:25:55,116 --> 01:25:57,209
in public.

1326
01:25:57,318 --> 01:25:59,718
No, it's Jane
and some Czech writer.

1327
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:01,789
Image kills me.

1328
01:26:03,424 --> 01:26:09,090
Just great. This is so frustrating,
because I'm terrible at conflict. I hate it.

1329
01:26:09,197 --> 01:26:11,859
And if I'd imagined this problem
while falling asleep one night...

1330
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:13,991
I don't think I would have
spoken up to you.

1331
01:26:14,102 --> 01:26:18,061
Even in my fantasy life I just would
have accepted it. That's who I am.

1332
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,073
But today I have to go.
I have to.

1333
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:24,077
And when I tell people about this in the future,
I know that -

1334
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:26,238
it'll be the time that I went.

1335
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:29,248
And I know that when I review
this whole episode in my head...

1336
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:31,750
I'm not gonna know what I did
or why I did it.

1337
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:34,754
I think they've done something
with the real Grover.

1338
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:37,256
But it'll make a good story
of my young adult life.

1339
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:40,759
You know,
the time I chose to go to Prague.

1340
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:44,923
I'll look back on it and I won't believe
that I actually went, you know. I went away.

1341
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:46,933
So let me go.

1342
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:49,162
I have to. I need -

1343
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:51,465
Just put me on the plane.

1344
01:26:51,573 --> 01:26:53,541
Let me go.

1345
01:27:02,116 --> 01:27:05,085
I think I can find a seat for you.

1346
01:27:14,829 --> 01:27:18,663
Very good, Mr. Cary.

1347
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:25,839
Now I'll just have to see your passport.

1348
01:27:42,523 --> 01:27:44,923
You can always go tomorrow.

1349
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:51,732
Mmm.

1350
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:00,841
Yeah.

1351
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:07,081
Thanks.

1352
01:28:18,926 --> 01:28:22,054
Sorry.
This is for my confession in the bar.

1353
01:28:22,163 --> 01:28:24,063
I'm - I'm a little drunk.

1354
01:28:24,165 --> 01:28:27,066
- But I didn't mean to scare you.
- That's okay. I'll take 50 cents.

1355
01:28:27,168 --> 01:28:29,136
Thanks.

1356
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:34,406
- You still find your name weird?
- Oh. No.

1357
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:36,704
Just happens to me occasionally.

1358
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:41,771
Oh, I came up with a great comeback
to something you said to me yesterday.

1359
01:28:43,384 --> 01:28:45,352
I can't remember it now, though.

1360
01:28:46,954 --> 01:28:49,354
How come I never saw you
before writing class?

1361
01:28:49,457 --> 01:28:52,358
I guess you didn't look.
I mean, I've always been there.

1362
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:55,361
Just to think, for four years
we were catching the same colds...

1363
01:28:55,463 --> 01:28:57,488
being bit by the same mosquitoes.

1364
01:28:57,598 --> 01:28:59,498
To think!

1365
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,329
So, what's your sign?

1366
01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:03,336
I'm a Scorpio.

1367
01:29:03,438 --> 01:29:05,338
Why?

1368
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:09,342
- I'm a Libra.
- Oh, really? What does that mean?

1369
01:29:09,444 --> 01:29:13,403
I don't know. It should mean something,
though. It sounds like it does.

1370
01:29:13,514 --> 01:29:15,414
Yeah, it does.

1371
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:17,711
- It must.
- Some story ideas?

1372
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:19,719
No, something occurred to me.

1373
01:29:19,821 --> 01:29:23,382
That's good to do that.
I always forget to carry writing materials.

1374
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:26,016
Is it really obnoxious?

1375
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:32,598
Okay, the way I see it...

1376
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:35,100
if we were an old couple
and dated for years...

1377
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:38,434
graduated away from all these
scholastic complications...

1378
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:40,905
and I reached over and kissed you...

1379
01:29:41,008 --> 01:29:44,409
you wouldn't say a word -
you'd be delighted... probably.

1380
01:29:44,512 --> 01:29:47,913
But if I was to do that now
it would be quite forward.

1381
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:51,678
And if I did it the first time we ever met,
you probably would hit me.

1382
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:57,151
What do you mean?

1383
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:02,391
I just wish we were an old couple
so I could do that.

1384
01:30:20,681 --> 01:30:23,650
What?
