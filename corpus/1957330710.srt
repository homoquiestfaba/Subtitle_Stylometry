1
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,964
You have to say something.

2
00:00:24,965 --> 00:00:27,447
What are people going to say?

3
00:00:27,448 --> 00:00:30,102
I don't care what people say.

4
00:00:30,103 --> 00:00:33,448
Look, you asked me to
come, and I'm here.

5
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:37,136
Just gonna pay my respects.

6
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,654
That's all I need to do.

7
00:00:38,655 --> 00:00:43,619
No matter what problems
you had, we are a family!

8
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,861
- He was your...
- I'm sorry, ma.

9
00:00:45,862 --> 00:00:47,310
I'm not speaking.

10
00:00:50,655 --> 00:00:53,965
He probably would've
wanted it this way.

- they were that good.

00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:10,241
Yeah, glad to be here.

00:04:10,242 --> 00:04:11,412

Hey, hey, hey everyone.

67
00:04:13,793 --> 00:04:15,067
- Hey.
- I wanna introduce you all

68
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:17,033
to Royce London.

69
00:04:17,034 --> 00:04:18,964
Those are my sons
Blaine and Camden.

70
00:04:18,965 --> 00:04:21,309
Blaine runs the Young Men's
Ministry I told you about.

71
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,378
- Mm-hmm.
- And these young people,

72
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:25,378
Amber, Akil, Dawn.

73
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:27,585
Well, they've been members of
the church since they were,

74
00:04:27,586 --> 00:04:28,792
when, the children's choir?

75
00:04:28,793 --> 00:04:29,964
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

76
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:31,274
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you all.

77
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:33,102
I have not heard singing
like that in a while.

78
00:04:33,103 --> 00:04:34,378
- Oh!
- You actually remind me

79
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:36,930
of when I first got started.

80
00:04:36,931 --> 00:04:39,586
The name of your group,
what's it stand for?

81
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:43,619
God Is Faithful
Today and Every Day.

82
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,067
Amen. Amen.

83
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:47,033
Now what y'all did tonight,
was that an original?

84
00:04:47,034 --> 00:04:50,205
Yeah, actually, my
brother wrote it.

85
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,619
He writes all of our stuff.

86
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,930
Yeah.

87
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:54,965
You got more songs like
that in your repertoire?

88
00:04:56,517 --> 00:04:57,965
Yes! Yes!

89
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,033
Well, I got to tell
y'all, y'all got something

90
00:05:03,034 --> 00:05:04,792
people would wanna hear.

91
00:05:04,793 --> 00:05:07,688
This right here? This is
a million dollar sound.

92
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:09,378
You should give me a call.

93
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:11,999
I'd love to hear
more of your music.

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,481
If you're ever in
Atlanta, look me up.

95
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,792
Thanks. I will.

96
00:05:17,793 --> 00:05:20,136
Yeah well, you
know, we're gonna...

97
00:05:20,137 --> 00:05:22,068
We'll reach out, right?

98
00:05:24,034 --> 00:05:25,309
Well, thank you.

99
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,619
Thank you for letting
me worship with you.

100
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,620
It was a blessing.

101
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:31,792
- I'll see you too.
- Bye!

102
00:05:31,793 --> 00:05:32,793
Told you!

103
00:05:34,655 --> 00:05:37,586
Don't worry. Like,
eh, eh, eh eh.

104
00:05:38,793 --> 00:05:40,619
Really, I didn't see it.

105
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,758
- Yeah.
- I didn't notice.

106
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,654
I know my father.

107
00:05:48,655 --> 00:05:50,481
He was not okay with it.

108
00:05:50,482 --> 00:05:53,550
So, what d'you think
he's gonna say?

109
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:57,723
It'll start with, "I'm
really disappointed in you."

110
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:01,206
And then it'll end with, "I'm
really disappointed in you."

111
00:06:01,931 --> 00:06:03,033
Well,

112
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:04,689
if he had any sense,

113
00:06:06,137 --> 00:06:10,413
he would say that you showed
great leadership tonight.

114
00:06:12,344 --> 00:06:13,551
And,

115
00:06:16,517 --> 00:06:18,068
for once,

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,930
it would be about
what Godwanted,

117
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:26,310
not your father.

118
00:06:29,068 --> 00:06:30,931
Hey! I'm proud of you.

119
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:43,827
Uh. We shouldn't.

120
00:06:44,482 --> 00:06:46,172
Yeah, you're right.

121
00:06:47,862 --> 00:06:50,412
Or we could skip dinner, and...

122
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:53,654
I thought we were
trying to wait 'til...

123
00:06:53,655 --> 00:06:55,585
'Til marriage?

124
00:07:01,965 --> 00:07:05,931
Are you gonna let me in
on when that's gonna be?

125
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:14,930
Your mom is taking me dress
shopping this weekend.

126
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:17,102
She said it's just for fun.

127
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:21,448
And she wants to dress me
up like a matrimony Barbie.

128
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:28,102
She's more ready for me to
walk down the aisle than you.

129
00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:30,999
Dawn, when the time is right...

130
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,551
But I want you now!

131
00:07:33,758 --> 00:07:35,792
I want you too.

132
00:07:35,793 --> 00:07:37,758
But I also respect you,

133
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:41,930
and love you.

134
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:45,343
And we made a promise to
God and to each other.

135
00:07:45,344 --> 00:07:47,103
And we're gonna wait.

136
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,413
When the time is right.

137
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:08,448
Really? You just got in, bro.

138
00:08:09,482 --> 00:08:10,861
Trina ain't tired of you yet?

139
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:12,171
Man, I don't know about Trina,

140
00:08:12,172 --> 00:08:14,033
but Danielle can't get
enough of your boy.

141
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:16,793
Don't wait up.

142
00:08:18,517 --> 00:08:20,240
Like I ever do, bro.

143
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:21,310
Like, what?

144
00:08:38,137 --> 00:08:40,000
You forgot your keys?

145
00:08:42,034 --> 00:08:44,896
Dad!

146
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:46,724
Why are you...

147
00:08:49,172 --> 00:08:51,137
What happened tonight,

148
00:08:52,137 --> 00:08:55,344
better not ever happen again.

149
00:08:57,448 --> 00:08:58,482
You hear me?

150
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:03,965
Showboatin' for,
for Royce London!

151
00:09:05,103 --> 00:09:05,931
I wasn't.

152
00:09:05,932 --> 00:09:07,620
Of course you did.

153
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,034
That's my church!

154
00:09:11,896 --> 00:09:13,757
You hear me?

155
00:09:13,758 --> 00:09:16,517
You play what I
tell you to play.

156
00:09:18,551 --> 00:09:21,241
And you do what
I tell you to do!

157
00:09:24,862 --> 00:09:27,379
Don't you ever cross me again.

158
00:09:32,965 --> 00:09:33,965
Boy...

159
00:09:37,068 --> 00:09:38,068
Oh.

160
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:51,551
Dad.

161
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:03,102
So Cam, you'll update your dad

162
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,240
on all the talking points then?

163
00:10:05,241 --> 00:10:06,999
Yes. Ma'am. I'll let him know.

164
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,447
The foundation would also
like for the entire family

165
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:11,550
to stick around
for a group photo

166
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:13,964
with the volunteers after
"SO G-I-F-T-E-D" performs.

167
00:10:13,965 --> 00:10:15,240
Yes, of course.

168
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:16,654
Great.

169
00:10:16,655 --> 00:10:18,240
I will give them a call and
follow up with the caterers.

170
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:19,619
Is there anything
else, First Lady?

171
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,067
Oh no, Regina. Thank you.

172
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:23,102
Oh, just update the rest of the

173
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,895
fundraising committee for me.

174
00:10:25,896 --> 00:10:27,379
- You got it.
- Thank you.

175
00:10:30,068 --> 00:10:31,412
Baby?

176
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:33,136
You okay? You look tired.

177
00:10:33,137 --> 00:10:36,930
Yeah. Late night, just
working on some new songs.

178
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:40,757
Oh, workaholic, just
like your daddy.

179
00:10:40,758 --> 00:10:45,447
He stayed overnight studying
in his office again.

180
00:10:45,448 --> 00:10:47,413
Oh, thank you.

181
00:10:49,206 --> 00:10:52,965
You two reminded me so
much of him on Sunday.

182
00:10:54,068 --> 00:10:55,378
You may be too
young to remember,

183
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:58,067
but he used to sing
before his sermons.

184
00:10:58,068 --> 00:11:00,930
Oh, I fell in love
with that voice

185
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:05,102
the first time I heard him
sing, "Jesus Loves Me".

186
00:11:05,103 --> 00:11:08,481
And the man, ooh!

187
00:11:08,482 --> 00:11:10,102
He was so fine.

188
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:11,343
Momma, what!

189
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:12,619
- Nasty!
- Come on, Ma!

190
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,861
You was lusting over Daddy

191
00:11:13,862 --> 00:11:14,862
- in the pulpit like that?
- Oh, boy!

192
00:11:14,862 --> 00:11:15,862
Hush!

193
00:11:15,863 --> 00:11:17,654
Come on!

194
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:19,654
- Hush your mouth.
- Meet you later.

195
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:21,136
I'm just saying', you
still fine, Mama.

196
00:11:21,137 --> 00:11:23,274
I'm just, I'm just
playin', I'm just playin'.

197
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:24,826
Hmm.

198
00:11:24,827 --> 00:11:26,688
And you just as fine with
your pretty brown eyes.

199
00:11:27,758 --> 00:11:29,964
- Alright, bro.
- Alright, bro.

200
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:31,000
So...

201
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:37,275
I have lunch plans
with Dawn this weekend.

202
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:40,033
You mean shoppin' plans?

203
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:41,895
Well, if I wanna
have grandchildren

204
00:11:41,896 --> 00:11:43,792
I have to take things
into my own hands.

205
00:11:43,793 --> 00:11:45,309
Ma!

206
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,999
I don't know what you and
your brother are waiting on,

207
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,205
and you're not getting any
younger, and neither am I.

208
00:11:51,206 --> 00:11:53,447
It's time for you
to settle down.

209
00:11:53,448 --> 00:11:54,964
Mom!

210
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,619
It's all about the right time.

211
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,309
- You know we...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

212
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,378
It's all about the right lady.

213
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:02,171
Now your brother is
all over the place

214
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:05,586
but you at least have
an honest prospect.

215
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,172
And if you wait too long,
you're gonna miss out.

216
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:23,792
I know you have
responsibilities, so do I!

217
00:12:23,793 --> 00:12:27,205
But constantly covering
for you not showing up

218
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:28,550
shouldn't be one of them.

219
00:12:28,551 --> 00:12:29,861
So I missed your little meeting.

220
00:12:29,862 --> 00:12:32,241
Oh, don't do that!

221
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:34,378
I will make the next one.

222
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,067
You promised me no matter what,

223
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:40,068
that you would
prioritize home first.

224
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,412
I am sick of you
putting the church

225
00:12:43,413 --> 00:12:47,896
and herbefore me!

226
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:50,378
I didn't sign up for that.

227
00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:53,757
- After all these years...
- You know what I do.

228
00:12:53,758 --> 00:12:56,861
You know when I'm not here I
am taking care of business.

229
00:12:56,862 --> 00:13:01,826
Try to expand while keeping
us and the church afloat.

230
00:13:01,827 --> 00:13:05,792
Yes, I know what you do.

231
00:13:05,793 --> 00:13:09,792
And you need to figure
out a better way,

232
00:13:09,793 --> 00:13:11,309
- because if you don't...
- Rita.

233
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,102
I need you to show up for us!

234
00:13:14,103 --> 00:13:18,274
Billy. I need you to be
what I need you to be!

235
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:21,757
I am more than your
party planner

236
00:13:21,758 --> 00:13:23,827
and your little organizer.

237
00:13:24,413 --> 00:13:28,068
I am your wife, and
you will respect me!

238
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,931
And you will put
your family first!

239
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,620
I mean it!

240
00:13:40,758 --> 00:13:42,240
I've been doing
a lot of thinking

241
00:13:42,241 --> 00:13:43,964
and effective today,
"SO G-I-F-T-E-D" will be

242
00:13:43,965 --> 00:13:46,309
the official praise
team of the church.

243
00:13:47,586 --> 00:13:52,586
Camden. I am making you
the minister of music.

244
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:56,895
Well, we already have
a minister of music.

245
00:13:56,896 --> 00:14:00,309
Things change, and
it's gonna be great.

246
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,309
You're gonna write
original music,

247
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,550
songs your brother
will lead of course,

248
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:06,724
maybe record a few albums.

249
00:14:08,655 --> 00:14:10,343
Next thing you know
we'll be adding services

250
00:14:10,344 --> 00:14:11,964
because of everyone wanting to

251
00:14:11,965 --> 00:14:14,619
worship with
"SO G-I-F-T-E-D."

252
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,412
Bro, this is a good thing.

253
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:19,171
Congratulations man, the
group's gonna be hyped.

254
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:21,792
Just gotta write me a
couple of solos. All right?

255
00:14:21,793 --> 00:14:23,516
So what is it?

256
00:14:23,517 --> 00:14:26,343
Hmm? I thought you'd be happy?

257
00:14:26,344 --> 00:14:28,550
More responsibility.

258
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:29,862
More control?

259
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:36,137
God is in control.

260
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,378
The question is,

261
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:43,516
are you willing to
surrender your will for his?

262
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:44,517
I am.

263
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:49,826
You know, music is all
I ever wanted to do

264
00:14:49,827 --> 00:14:52,448
and to do it for you like this?

265
00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:54,689
Thanks Dad.

266
00:14:56,034 --> 00:15:00,654
I know I fought you for
choosing music over the pulpit.

267
00:15:00,655 --> 00:15:02,757
My dad had me make that choice

268
00:15:02,758 --> 00:15:04,619
and I truly learned
believing that

269
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,723
obedience is better
than sacrifice.

270
00:15:07,724 --> 00:15:08,724
Amen.

271
00:15:13,137 --> 00:15:16,895
But, son, I,

272
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:20,067
I do believe
that you are gifted.

273
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:25,034
And if it's your
time, it's your time.

274
00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:39,723
Oh my God, Blaine just told
me, babe, this is huge!

275
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:43,379
Congratulations!

276
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:46,034
What's wrong?

277
00:15:47,275 --> 00:15:49,136
Just doesn't feel right.

278
00:15:49,137 --> 00:15:51,619
Your father supporting you?

279
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,172
Yeah. That part.

280
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,826
You're thinking
too much into it.

281
00:16:11,827 --> 00:16:15,136
I think this is just your father
giving you the recognition

282
00:16:15,137 --> 00:16:19,310
you've always wanted, the
recognition you deserve.

283
00:16:21,862 --> 00:16:25,862
Relax babe. Enjoy your moment.

284
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:33,792
Come on, come on
this is big, come on!

285
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:34,964
You're supposed to be
excited about this.

286
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:36,517
All right, okay.

287
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,137
This is so exciting.

288
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,964
More "SO G-I-F-T-E-D",
yes, please!

289
00:16:51,758 --> 00:16:53,861
Oh, this year's choir

290
00:16:53,862 --> 00:16:57,619
anniversary is going
to be monumental.

291
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,448
I am so proud of my babies!

292
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,724
This is truly a celebration.

293
00:17:04,379 --> 00:17:06,240
Oh, and Camden.

294
00:17:06,241 --> 00:17:10,274
You are going to change
the face of music.

295
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:11,516
Cam-deezy.

296
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:14,792
And my son Blaine,

297
00:17:14,793 --> 00:17:16,585
he's gonna change
the face of gospel.

298
00:17:16,586 --> 00:17:18,205
- Mm-hmm.
- When he pastors

299
00:17:18,206 --> 00:17:20,378
the Church of Houston for me.

300
00:17:22,379 --> 00:17:23,379
Mm-hmm.

301
00:17:30,724 --> 00:17:33,516
Oh, I didn't realize you
finalized plans, Dad.

302
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:34,723
When you openin' it?

303
00:17:34,724 --> 00:17:36,447
Oh, it'll be at least
a year from now.

304
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:39,619
I'm gonna start with online
services weekly from here,

305
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,379
and then Blaine, he's gonna move
to Houston and run it all.

306
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:49,482
Praise the Lord.

307
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,999
Both of our sons walking
into their destinies.

308
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Amen.

309
00:18:07,482 --> 00:18:09,964
Dad, I am not ready, man.

310
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:11,136
And what about the group?

311
00:18:11,137 --> 00:18:13,619
What about it? Hmm?

312
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,516
Hey, you can keep singin'.

313
00:18:15,517 --> 00:18:18,309
A lot of pastors
sing, and do well.

314
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,102
Yeah, but, don't I have to
go to seminary school first?

315
00:18:20,103 --> 00:18:22,412
I trained you for this, Blaine.

316
00:18:22,413 --> 00:18:24,413
The word is in you, son.

317
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:28,379
But, that's the least
of your worries.

318
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,964
It is,

319
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:32,964
it is time for you
to settle down.

320
00:18:34,103 --> 00:18:36,240
Hedid findeth a wife.

321
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,792
Wait, whoa, wait,
Dad, Dad, a wife!

322
00:18:38,793 --> 00:18:39,758
Wait, what!?

323
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:40,792
What are you talking about?

324
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:43,586
What about Amber? Huh?

325
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:44,930
Oh, my God!

326
00:18:44,931 --> 00:18:47,448
Well she, she's lovely.

327
00:18:48,689 --> 00:18:53,550
And a singing
First Lady has great appeal.

328
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:55,413
No, Amber, Dad!

329
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,999
No, Dad, marriage is
the very last thing

330
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,723
- that's on my mind.
- No-one's gonna trust

331
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,620
a single pastor, okay?

332
00:19:06,517 --> 00:19:09,550
So, we have to have
a solid foundation

333
00:19:09,551 --> 00:19:11,171
as we go into Houston,

334
00:19:11,172 --> 00:19:12,343
- as we start...
- No, Dad, Dad, Dad.

335
00:19:12,344 --> 00:19:13,550
Didn't you say
it'll take a while

336
00:19:13,551 --> 00:19:17,205
before I took over
the new church, right?

337
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:18,654
I just wanna focus on my music.

338
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,689
This is not a request.

339
00:19:21,965 --> 00:19:24,724
You need someone
solid, reliable.

340
00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:29,481
You need someone you
can marry within a year.

341
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:30,482
A year!

342
00:19:31,482 --> 00:19:32,827
A year! A year!

343
00:19:34,344 --> 00:19:37,447
What about your mother's
assistant? Regina?

344
00:19:37,448 --> 00:19:38,999
Dad! What?

345
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,067
Hmm. Her father, and her
grandfather were pastors.

346
00:19:43,068 --> 00:19:47,240
You two, you
would be Christian royalty!

347
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:48,723
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad,

348
00:19:48,724 --> 00:19:49,826
not her please!

349
00:19:49,827 --> 00:19:52,000
- I already...
- She's the one!

350
00:19:52,827 --> 00:19:54,172
She'll be great.

351
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,137
She'll be great.

352
00:19:58,206 --> 00:20:02,000
Trust me.

353
00:20:02,862 --> 00:20:04,034
I trust you.

354
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:09,206
I trust you.

355
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:13,585
Are you serious?

356
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:16,654
- What?
- I don't wanna marry you!

357
00:20:16,655 --> 00:20:18,826
- You're trash!
- Wow!

358
00:20:18,827 --> 00:20:21,171
You cheated on me
with my best friend.

359
00:20:21,172 --> 00:20:22,999
Yo, Gina, I apologized for that.

360
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,067
Why are you trying to
live in the past for?

361
00:20:25,068 --> 00:20:26,964
Live in the past?

362
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:28,550
The last thing I said
to you was that I

363
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:29,861
never wanna speak to you again

364
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:32,654
and you come to with
this, a proposal?

365
00:20:32,655 --> 00:20:34,033
No!

366
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:35,895
Listen, just stop, just stop.

367
00:20:35,896 --> 00:20:37,999
It's a proposition, okay?

368
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,481
One that could
benefit you and me.

369
00:20:40,482 --> 00:20:41,964
Look, Psalm 13 says...

370
00:20:41,965 --> 00:20:42,896
Man, I swear you
start spewing out

371
00:20:42,897 --> 00:20:45,309
your biblical psycho bull.

372
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,654
My faith actually
means something to me.

373
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:52,343
Your faith? Really
means somethi...

374
00:20:52,344 --> 00:20:54,964
Your faith means
something to you? Really?

375
00:20:54,965 --> 00:20:56,412
Come on, don't do that.

376
00:20:56,413 --> 00:20:58,412
- That, was a mistake.
- Oh wow!

377
00:20:58,413 --> 00:20:59,964
-Okay, you were a mistake,
-Okay.

378
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:03,102
And this, could be
an epic mistake!

379
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:06,688
Look, it's all my
dad's idea, all right?

380
00:21:06,689 --> 00:21:09,412
Gina, I know you can't stand me.

381
00:21:09,413 --> 00:21:13,136
And to be honest, I
really can't stand you.

382
00:21:13,137 --> 00:21:16,240
But look, together, we can
build a young mega church

383
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:19,412
unlike anything Houston's
ever seen before!

384
00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:21,379
A strong music ministry.

385
00:21:22,551 --> 00:21:24,412
A strong women's
ministry led by you.

386
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:25,792
And ran through by you?

387
00:21:25,793 --> 00:21:27,550
You see, I can't even...

388
00:21:27,551 --> 00:21:28,792
Crazy.

389
00:21:28,793 --> 00:21:29,793
The way you cast the vision

390
00:21:29,794 --> 00:21:32,654
you sound just like your father.

391
00:21:32,655 --> 00:21:36,240
My father is a good man,
and he believes in me.

392
00:21:36,241 --> 00:21:39,067
- Hmm.
- Gina, he believes in us.

393
00:21:39,068 --> 00:21:40,448
We could do this!

394
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:44,619
Okay.

395
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,412
Thank you.

396
00:21:46,413 --> 00:21:48,412
- How many stacks?
- Excuse me?

397
00:21:48,413 --> 00:21:50,274
I mean, you're asking
me to be one half

398
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:53,136
of a loveless marriage
for the sake of a church.

399
00:21:53,137 --> 00:21:56,102
I think a check is an order.

400
00:21:56,103 --> 00:21:58,585
You know, the
harvest is plentiful

401
00:21:58,586 --> 00:22:00,240
- but the laborers...
- So it's like that?

402
00:22:00,241 --> 00:22:01,792
Just like that.

403
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,481
Let me just talk to my father,

404
00:22:09,482 --> 00:22:10,930
- all right?
- No.

405
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:12,826
I'll talk to your father.

406
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:15,964
Pastor Wilson and I
speak the same language.

407
00:22:15,965 --> 00:22:18,586
So, does that mean you're in?

408
00:22:22,448 --> 00:22:23,448
We'll see.

409
00:22:28,758 --> 00:22:32,861
♪ Blessed assurance

410
00:22:32,862 --> 00:22:37,688
♪ Jesus is mine

411
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:42,378

Hey!

416
00:22:56,586 --> 00:22:58,792
Hey, Royce. How are you?

417
00:22:58,793 --> 00:23:00,861
I'm not used to
waiting for folk.

418
00:23:00,862 --> 00:23:03,861
Now, I love that
song you guys sung

419
00:23:03,862 --> 00:23:06,757
when I came to visit, you
know, "Born to Worship."

420
00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:08,550
Well, I'd also
love to put that song

421
00:23:08,551 --> 00:23:10,585
on one of my compilation albums.

422
00:23:10,586 --> 00:23:12,999
Who knows? Could turn
into a record deal.

423
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,240
Now, as soon as that song drops

424
00:23:14,241 --> 00:23:17,205
I put you guys out
on my labels tour.

425
00:23:17,206 --> 00:23:20,516
How would you feel about
coming out to Atlanta?

426
00:23:20,517 --> 00:23:22,397
I'd love to bring you out
here for a few months.

427
00:23:23,241 --> 00:23:25,274
A few months?

428
00:23:25,275 --> 00:23:26,378
You know, we need
to collaborate.

429
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:27,861
We need to work on some music.

430
00:23:27,862 --> 00:23:28,862
Is that a problem?

431
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:31,930
-No, no, I-I-
-I mean, if you need

432
00:23:31,931 --> 00:23:34,309
some time to think about
it just let me know.

433
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,447
I don't...

434
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:38,000
Yeah. I'd love to.

435
00:23:38,344 --> 00:23:40,205
Just let me talk to my dad.

436
00:23:40,206 --> 00:23:41,378
Understood.

437
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:43,585
Well, hit me back, we'll
work on the details.

438
00:23:43,586 --> 00:23:46,413
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

439
00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:52,172
Big BZ in the house!

440
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:57,688
Why you hatin' bro?

441
00:23:57,689 --> 00:23:59,102
- Why you hatin' bro?
- Big Beezy though?

442
00:23:59,103 --> 00:24:00,378
Big BZ.

443
00:24:00,379 --> 00:24:02,067
- You can retire that one.
- A'ight, fine.

444
00:24:02,068 --> 00:24:03,274
Where you been?

445
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,274
Oh, I was with dad
at the old building.

446
00:24:05,275 --> 00:24:06,516
- Oh.
- You know,

447
00:24:06,517 --> 00:24:09,413
Trini might've been
there with Big Beezy.

448
00:24:09,827 --> 00:24:11,826
Anyway.

449
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:12,999
Guess who I got off
the phone with bro.

450
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,793
Who?

451
00:24:13,794 --> 00:24:15,067
Royce London.

452
00:24:15,068 --> 00:24:16,068
Okay.

453
00:24:16,827 --> 00:24:18,516
He wants us to record a song

454
00:24:18,517 --> 00:24:21,102
on his new record
label's project

455
00:24:21,103 --> 00:24:22,481
and go on tour with him.

456
00:24:22,482 --> 00:24:23,964
- And go on tour?
- Yeah.

457
00:24:23,965 --> 00:24:26,447
No, no, no, no bro, this
is for real, for real?

458
00:24:26,448 --> 00:24:27,757
Yeah.

459
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,619
We're about to record
with a major label.

460
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,792
- Yeah.
- And go on tour!

461
00:24:31,793 --> 00:24:32,758
- Yeah.
- No, you're not hearing tour

462
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:33,895
the way I'm hearing.

463
00:24:33,896 --> 00:24:34,724
Camden, do you,

464
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:35,826
No, no, you're not.

465
00:24:35,827 --> 00:24:37,481
Do you know what a tour means?

466
00:24:37,482 --> 00:24:38,999
I feel you!

467
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,447
No, do you understand how
much sexy and sanctified tail

468
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:44,619
we gonna get on this road, boy?

469
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,343
Oh man. Evil.

470
00:24:46,344 --> 00:24:47,585
I'm sayin'.

471
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:50,723
And, after we do
the single his album

472
00:24:50,724 --> 00:24:52,274
we shoot the music video.

473
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:56,275
Nah, nah, we do the remix.
The remix will be better.

474
00:24:58,275 --> 00:25:00,964
What's going on? What's wrong?

475
00:25:00,965 --> 00:25:02,550
He also wants me
to go to Atlanta

476
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:04,792
and write some songs for him.

477
00:25:04,793 --> 00:25:05,965
Okay. For how long?

478
00:25:06,827 --> 00:25:08,103
A few months.

479
00:25:10,689 --> 00:25:14,999
I mean, see how you gonna
record the single and be here?

480
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,171
How are you?

481
00:25:16,172 --> 00:25:17,723
I mean, I'm gonna
record the single here

482
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,067
but then I gotta go.

483
00:25:23,965 --> 00:25:24,965
Hold on.

484
00:25:28,689 --> 00:25:33,689
So you're going to Atlanta to
get away from Dawn and Dad?

485
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,550
I'm confused.

486
00:25:35,551 --> 00:25:36,688
I thought you were the
one leaving us behind?

487
00:25:36,689 --> 00:25:37,517
-Well, I thought too-
-To run your

488
00:25:37,518 --> 00:25:38,688
big church in Houston.

489
00:25:38,689 --> 00:25:40,516
Well, I thought you
were gonna come with me!

490
00:25:40,517 --> 00:25:41,723
How am I gonna do that?

491
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:45,481
Dad has me running
his music ministry.

492
00:25:45,482 --> 00:25:46,482
Wow!

493
00:25:48,068 --> 00:25:50,067
Now I see what it's about, bro.

494
00:25:50,068 --> 00:25:52,688
I see it clear now man.

495
00:25:52,689 --> 00:25:56,378
Cam, this whole time you
want to be the star, man.

496
00:25:56,379 --> 00:25:57,895
Come on. That's you dog.

497
00:25:57,896 --> 00:25:59,861
I just wanna make music.

498
00:25:59,862 --> 00:26:01,550
Do you not see this?

499
00:26:01,551 --> 00:26:02,585
Do it here.

500
00:26:02,586 --> 00:26:04,550
They have your favorite.

501
00:26:04,551 --> 00:26:05,551
Do it here!

502
00:26:06,724 --> 00:26:09,378
If Royce was calling you
to come work instead of me,

503
00:26:09,379 --> 00:26:12,206
would you settle
for staying here?

504
00:26:14,275 --> 00:26:15,275
All right.

505
00:26:30,034 --> 00:26:33,033
You know, it's gonna be
the first time that we...

506
00:26:33,034 --> 00:26:34,034
I know.

507
00:26:35,413 --> 00:26:36,413
I know.

508
00:26:38,068 --> 00:26:39,585
Well, we always knew your music

509
00:26:39,586 --> 00:26:42,585
would take you around the world.

510
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:45,585
Just, you know, don't forget

511
00:26:45,586 --> 00:26:47,585
to get my foot in the
door when it's time

512
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:49,619
for Big Beezy's album.

513
00:26:59,482 --> 00:27:01,931
- So how you gonna tell...
- Dad?

514
00:27:02,827 --> 00:27:04,448
I'll figure it out.

515
00:27:05,655 --> 00:27:09,792
Not bad, Cam.

516
00:27:09,793 --> 00:27:12,275
So that's it, you're going?

517
00:27:13,793 --> 00:27:16,481
Did you even think about
taking me with you?

518
00:27:16,482 --> 00:27:17,826
Do you wanna go?

519
00:27:17,827 --> 00:27:20,620
No Cam, I want you
to want me to go.

520
00:27:21,793 --> 00:27:23,792
So what does this mean for us?

521
00:27:23,793 --> 00:27:26,378
Is this a part of your
perfect one-year plan

522
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:27,964
or do you just wanna
put this on hold

523
00:27:27,965 --> 00:27:31,171
until you finish pursuing the
next stage of your career?

524
00:27:31,172 --> 00:27:32,826
Why? You wanna see other people?

525
00:27:32,827 --> 00:27:36,068
No, but I don't
wanna be left behind!

526
00:27:37,206 --> 00:27:39,516
God, I just want
you to fight for us!

527
00:27:39,517 --> 00:27:41,930
Look, I'm just taking
a temporary job

528
00:27:41,931 --> 00:27:43,619
to launch my career

529
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,378
and all you or anyone
else can think about

530
00:27:45,379 --> 00:27:47,136
is how it affects you.

531
00:27:47,137 --> 00:27:48,619
What about me?

532
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,586
What about what I want?

533
00:27:51,689 --> 00:27:53,931
I thought you wanted me.

534
00:27:54,827 --> 00:27:55,827
I do.

535
00:27:58,482 --> 00:28:03,310
But not more than you want
this opportunity with Royce.

536
00:28:05,655 --> 00:28:08,205
I love you and I love music.

537
00:28:08,206 --> 00:28:10,000
Why are you trying
to make me choose?

538
00:28:11,034 --> 00:28:13,033
Come on, you don't
have to leave.

539
00:28:13,034 --> 00:28:15,517
No, you don't have to leave!

540
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,517
Who am I to stand in your way?

541
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:25,240
Dawn!

542
00:28:25,241 --> 00:28:26,792
Before I get into
the word today,

543
00:28:26,793 --> 00:28:30,378
I wanna share some of
the wonderful things

544
00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:33,033
the Lord has been
doing in this house!

545
00:28:34,517 --> 00:28:38,895
Now some of y'all have been
with us from the very beginning,

546
00:28:38,896 --> 00:28:42,999
and you have seen my family

547
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,172
grow up right before your eyes!

548
00:28:46,551 --> 00:28:48,033
Hmm!

549
00:28:48,034 --> 00:28:50,447
And, as you see,

550
00:28:50,448 --> 00:28:53,999
we have recently
installed Camden

551
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,310
as minister of music.

552
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,275
- Amen!
- Amen!

553
00:29:02,827 --> 00:29:06,482
- Hey, yeah, hey yeah!
- Go Camden, go Camden!

554
00:29:06,586 --> 00:29:07,586
Huh, huh!

555
00:29:07,931 --> 00:29:09,550
And, and,

556
00:29:09,551 --> 00:29:11,757
in the very near future,

557
00:29:11,758 --> 00:29:14,619
we are going to witness

558
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,447
Blaine walk into his destiny

559
00:29:18,448 --> 00:29:22,172
as the pastor of our first

560
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:26,136
satellite church in Houston!

561
00:29:26,137 --> 00:29:27,827
Huh! How about that?

562
00:29:28,793 --> 00:29:31,102
How at that?

563
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:34,136
Ah-ha, son!

564
00:29:34,137 --> 00:29:36,136
Give me your hand.

565
00:29:36,137 --> 00:29:38,931
Give me your hand
and come forth.

566
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,309
That's right.

567
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,827
Come forward my son, because,

568
00:29:44,931 --> 00:29:49,137
I am gonna pray an
Elijah prayer over you,

569
00:29:50,103 --> 00:29:52,586
as I pass the ministry mantle.

570
00:29:53,896 --> 00:29:57,240
So, turn around, uh-huh.

571
00:29:57,241 --> 00:30:00,274
Face it, face it young
man, young man.

572
00:30:00,275 --> 00:30:01,447
Come on, come, come,
come on, come on.

573
00:30:01,448 --> 00:30:03,274
- Amen!
- Yeah! Amen!

574
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:04,275
Bring your stuff.

575
00:30:04,276 --> 00:30:05,654
All right, all right, all right.

576
00:30:05,655 --> 00:30:08,586
Now, now, I don't
know about y'all,

577
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,758
but I hear that God...

578
00:30:14,068 --> 00:30:15,826
is gonna perform

579
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:20,102
some awesome miracles
through this ministry!

580
00:30:20,932 --> 00:30:22,034
Ah-ha! Ah-ha!

581
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:25,585
Like he did in the
days of Elijah!

582
00:30:25,586 --> 00:30:26,931
Hmm?

583
00:30:27,137 --> 00:30:29,688
Bring my oil, bring
my oil, bring my oil.

584
00:30:29,689 --> 00:30:34,275
Now, Elijah passed
the mantle down

585
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:37,758
at the end of his
ministry. Hmm?

586
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:40,171
I'm gonna say it again. I
don't think y'all hear me.

587
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:44,447
He passed the mantle down
at the end of his ministry.

588
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:50,758
But I, I bestow the magic

589
00:30:51,103 --> 00:30:53,930
to you at the height...

590
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,412
At the height, all right
come on, can you her me?

591
00:30:59,413 --> 00:31:01,862
At the height of my ministry!

592
00:31:03,137 --> 00:31:05,171
Hmm? All right!

593
00:31:05,172 --> 00:31:07,448
So, may God bless you, son.

594
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:12,895
And may God keep you, son.

595
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:16,482
In trust, truer...

596
00:31:24,172 --> 00:31:25,692
- Amen!
- Amen!

597
00:31:39,344 --> 00:31:40,965
You okay, Cam Deezy?

598
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:43,517
Why wouldn't I be?

599
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,999
Nothing I do is ever
good enough for him.

600
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,964
It doesn't even matter.

601
00:31:55,965 --> 00:31:57,930
God already chose your path.

602
00:31:57,931 --> 00:32:01,274
You're gonna go to
Atlanta and be great, Cam.

603
00:32:01,275 --> 00:32:02,585
Believe that.

604
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:04,378
You don't feel like I'll
be abandoning the group?

605
00:32:04,379 --> 00:32:05,412
How?

606
00:32:05,413 --> 00:32:06,585
We're about to record a single

607
00:32:06,586 --> 00:32:08,757
because of the song you wrote.

608
00:32:08,758 --> 00:32:11,033
And I know, once
you get out there

609
00:32:11,034 --> 00:32:13,067
and turn them in the spirit,

610
00:32:13,068 --> 00:32:15,034
more doors will
open for all of us.

611
00:32:16,551 --> 00:32:18,585
You really sure?

612
00:32:18,586 --> 00:32:20,930
You're the guy who
took me to prom

613
00:32:20,931 --> 00:32:25,585
because my date stood me up,
the night of, for someone else.

614
00:32:25,586 --> 00:32:26,895
Yeah.

615
00:32:26,896 --> 00:32:28,136
You've always been
there for others

616
00:32:28,137 --> 00:32:30,723
making sure they're okay.

617
00:32:30,724 --> 00:32:31,965
Yeah. I'm sure.

618
00:32:33,586 --> 00:32:35,274
You're not abandoning us,

619
00:32:35,275 --> 00:32:37,689
and we're not abandoning you.

620
00:32:41,551 --> 00:32:42,551
Thank you.

621
00:32:44,482 --> 00:32:46,344
I needed to hear that.

622
00:32:48,965 --> 00:32:52,206
So, you taking Dawn
with you or what?

623
00:32:54,793 --> 00:32:58,412
Keep an eye on my
girl until I get back.

624
00:32:58,413 --> 00:32:59,551
You got it.

I mean, I knew you were good,
but hearing you in here!

636
00:33:38,655 --> 00:33:40,481
Oh! No, that's it.

637
00:33:40,482 --> 00:33:45,033
That's it, I've decided, we
are recording an album, huh?

638
00:33:45,034 --> 00:33:46,619
Okay Camden, you can
go and start working

639
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,826
on the new music
next week, all right?

640
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:51,274
And I can book studio
time right now.

641
00:33:53,413 --> 00:33:54,413
What? What?

642
00:33:57,275 --> 00:33:59,137
Dad, we need to talk.

643
00:34:04,517 --> 00:34:06,378
What about your ministry here?

644
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:07,861
I prayed about it.

645
00:34:07,862 --> 00:34:09,378
I believe that shadowing Royce

646
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:11,067
as the minister of
music of his church

647
00:34:11,068 --> 00:34:13,654
will better prepare me to run
the music department here.

648
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,172
Oh, you prayed about it?

649
00:34:22,551 --> 00:34:25,757
Well did you pray about
what you will do for money?

650
00:34:25,758 --> 00:34:27,343
Royce is gonna pay me
as one of the musicians

651
00:34:27,344 --> 00:34:30,516
of his church and for every
song I do on his record,

652
00:34:30,517 --> 00:34:32,343
and he's gonna let
me live in his house

653
00:34:32,344 --> 00:34:35,274
so I don't even have to pay
for rent or bills, or all that.

654
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:38,033
So we're supposed to go
without a minister of music.

655
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,378
So you can go and do what?

656
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:41,688
Make music.

657
00:34:41,689 --> 00:34:43,102
This is a solid
opportunity, Dad.

658
00:34:43,103 --> 00:34:45,171
This is a waste of time.

659
00:34:45,172 --> 00:34:46,861
This is my shot!

660
00:34:46,862 --> 00:34:49,274
I gave you a shot.

661
00:34:49,275 --> 00:34:52,067
And like I expected
you blew it off,

662
00:34:52,068 --> 00:34:55,033
running to go make
music with someone else

663
00:34:55,034 --> 00:34:56,412
outside your family!

664
00:34:56,413 --> 00:34:57,206
Dad...

665
00:34:57,207 --> 00:34:59,205
I gave you all the platform

666
00:34:59,206 --> 00:35:02,758
and opportunity you
needed for your music.

667
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:07,310
That's fine. Hmm.

668
00:35:09,137 --> 00:35:12,067
"SO G-I-F-T-E-D" is
employed by the church.

669
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,654
We have an agreement.

670
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:18,241
So whatever you do, I own
you, and the church owns you!

671
00:35:19,413 --> 00:35:21,274
And by the way, I'll
make sure Royce knows

672
00:35:21,275 --> 00:35:24,481
where to send those
royalty checks.

673
00:35:24,482 --> 00:35:25,757
There it is.

674
00:35:25,758 --> 00:35:27,481
That's why the promotion.

675
00:35:27,482 --> 00:35:29,619
It's always about
the money with you.

676
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,723
Nothing about God calling me.

677
00:35:31,724 --> 00:35:32,930
Just you using me.

678
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:36,136
You have always been ungrateful.

679
00:35:36,137 --> 00:35:38,861
You leave and you are done here!

680
00:35:38,862 --> 00:35:42,412
I'll cut you off and you
won't have a place here

681
00:35:42,413 --> 00:35:47,068
when everything falls apart,
you come runnin' back home.

682
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:56,241
Don't worry. I won't.

683
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:01,206
You just gonna leave like that?

684
00:36:23,862 --> 00:36:26,379
I always knew you were gifted.

685
00:36:27,517 --> 00:36:29,654
I knew from the first
time your little

686
00:36:29,655 --> 00:36:34,516
three-year old fingers brushed
across your toy keyboard.

687
00:36:34,517 --> 00:36:38,412
That's why I invested
in all of your lessons.

688
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:41,757
I was more than your mom,
I was your chauffeur,

689
00:36:41,758 --> 00:36:46,517
cheerleader, manager, backup
singer, whatever you needed.

690
00:36:49,862 --> 00:36:52,550
I never missed a recital.

691
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:54,344
I never let you quit.

692
00:37:00,379 --> 00:37:03,620
I always knew you
were gonna be great.

693
00:37:05,206 --> 00:37:08,793
That's why I can't let
you leave like this.

694
00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:13,205
I love you, mom.

695
00:37:13,206 --> 00:37:16,585
And I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

696
00:37:16,586 --> 00:37:18,378
But how am I supposed to leave?

697
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:21,034
With your head up.

698
00:37:22,758 --> 00:37:27,379
Hmm, with love, with support,

699
00:37:28,655 --> 00:37:31,758
knowing if there's
anything you need,

700
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:36,620
anything, I'm here for you.

701
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,000
I love you, Cam.

702
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:47,586
Just know...

703
00:37:49,413 --> 00:37:50,620
that mama?

704
00:37:51,689 --> 00:37:55,034
Will always be here.

00:38:08,206 --> 00:38:12,964

00:39:28,206 --> 00:39:29,447
Royce is waiting on
you in the studio.

714
00:39:29,448 --> 00:39:31,000
I'll take your bag.

715
00:39:33,931 --> 00:39:34,931
Follow me.

716
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,344
No. I prefer sweet tea, please.

717
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:27,344
Well, aren't you a country boy?

718
00:40:28,931 --> 00:40:30,757
You're Ivy Whitlow.

719
00:40:30,758 --> 00:40:32,688
I am. And you are?

720
00:40:32,689 --> 00:40:35,481
I'm sorry, I'm Camden Wilson.

721
00:40:35,482 --> 00:40:36,550
Pleased to meet you.

722
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:38,895
Oh, I know who you are.

723
00:40:38,896 --> 00:40:42,757
Royce talks about your
music all the time.

724
00:40:42,758 --> 00:40:43,930
Can I get you a drink?

725
00:40:43,931 --> 00:40:45,792
I'm good, thank you.

726
00:40:45,793 --> 00:40:50,205
Hmm, handsome and chivalrous,
but I'll tell you what,

727
00:40:50,206 --> 00:40:53,585
these Atlanta birds are
gonna scoop you right up.

728
00:40:53,586 --> 00:40:55,861
I have a girlfriend in Dallas.

729
00:40:55,862 --> 00:40:57,930
Well, she's back in Dallas.

730
00:40:57,931 --> 00:40:59,447
I'll warn you now.

731
00:40:59,448 --> 00:41:03,448
These Atlanta women,
they're a different breed.

732
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,619
So, I know you're
a super songwriter.

733
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,619
Do you also sing?

734
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,861
No. I just write the songs.

735
00:41:10,862 --> 00:41:13,481
I leave all that up
to my brother, Blaine.

736
00:41:13,482 --> 00:41:16,586
Okay, well, let's
see what you got.

737
00:41:18,827 --> 00:41:19,827
Okay.

738
00:41:33,275 --> 00:41:34,999
Hold on, hold on.

739
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,274
Camden Wilson.

740
00:41:36,275 --> 00:41:37,447
- Hey.
- Welcome.

741
00:41:37,448 --> 00:41:38,619
Welcome to Atlanta.

742
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,309
- Oh, thank you.
- You have a good trip?

743
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:41,619
- Yeah.
- Good.

744
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,619
Well, you told me
you had 100 songs,

745
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,482
so, let's get to work.

746
00:41:47,413 --> 00:41:50,171
It's all your yours, let's go.

747
00:41:50,172 --> 00:41:51,172
Okay.

748
00:41:54,103 --> 00:41:58,067
This is the song I was
thinking about on the way here.

749
00:41:58,068 --> 00:41:59,068
Um...

750
00:42:01,862 --> 00:42:06,862

See why I wanted him to come?

00:42:43,689 --> 00:42:46,205
- Hmm.
- Welcome to Atlanta, Camden.

760
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,481
What's up y'all? This is...

761
00:42:59,482 --> 00:43:00,723
"SO G-I-F-T-E-D"

762
00:43:00,724 --> 00:43:02,861
And you're listening to WPRS,

763
00:43:02,862 --> 00:43:05,448
the only gospel
station in Houston.

764
00:43:39,206 --> 00:43:44,206

These lyrics are great.

772
00:44:17,896 --> 00:44:21,586
I just made this one
adjustment to the vamp.

773
00:44:24,586 --> 00:44:26,000
It's right there.

774
00:44:27,034 --> 00:44:30,516

This is pretty great.

777
00:44:36,862 --> 00:44:38,309
It works.

778
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,481
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

779
00:44:40,482 --> 00:44:43,654
I think you may have just
finished my new single.

780
00:44:43,655 --> 00:44:44,895
I've been hearing great things

781
00:44:44,896 --> 00:44:47,136
about "SO G-I-F-T-E-D"
on these gospel blogs.

782
00:44:47,137 --> 00:44:48,378
Their performances
are generating

783
00:44:48,379 --> 00:44:49,895
a lot of buzz for
going to worship.

784
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:53,241
Yeah. Blaine tells me they
booking all over the place.

785
00:44:54,137 --> 00:44:55,309
Opening for my dad.

786
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:56,999
He's preaching everywhere.

787
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,654
Yeah, I've actually
been talking to your dad

788
00:44:58,655 --> 00:45:02,033
trying to figure out a way
for us all to work together.

789
00:45:02,034 --> 00:45:03,550
Sounds like a plan to me.

790
00:45:03,551 --> 00:45:05,067
I just wanna make music.

791
00:45:05,068 --> 00:45:07,412
Well, those conversations
will happen,

792
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,895
right, after "Born To Worship"
goes to radio next week.

793
00:45:09,896 --> 00:45:12,723
I can't believe my song
is gonna be on the radio!

794
00:45:12,724 --> 00:45:15,171
Between that and my
new single with Ivy,

795
00:45:15,172 --> 00:45:18,033
everybody's gonna
know your name.

796
00:45:18,034 --> 00:45:20,896
Have you thought
about going solo?

797
00:45:21,862 --> 00:45:23,999
And leave the group?

798
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And do what?

799
00:45:25,001 --> 00:45:26,240
Be your own artist.

800
00:45:26,241 --> 00:45:29,033
Or write for other
artists full time.

801
00:45:29,034 --> 00:45:31,102
I haven't thought
about that at all.

802
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,378
Well, you should.

803
00:45:33,379 --> 00:45:35,516
Ivy's been begging me to
let you write for her.

804
00:45:35,517 --> 00:45:37,689
And I'm struggling finding
songs for her new album.

805
00:45:39,172 --> 00:45:40,517
Maybe you should take a stab?

806
00:45:42,517 --> 00:45:44,033
Are you serious?

807
00:45:44,034 --> 00:45:46,343
I'm going deposit money
into your account.

808
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:49,861
It's a deposit to help
me produce Ivy's album.

809
00:45:49,862 --> 00:45:51,344
I'm very serious.

00:46:31,758 --> 00:46:33,999
I really enjoyed service
today, Dr. Whitlow.

818
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,171
Please, just call me Norman.

819
00:46:36,172 --> 00:46:37,447
I feel like we're brothers

820
00:46:37,448 --> 00:46:39,447
as much as I followed
your father's ministry.

821
00:46:39,448 --> 00:46:40,930
You know, I bet
you Camden's father

822
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:42,412
really misses him leading
praise and worship?

823
00:46:42,413 --> 00:46:46,343
Well, since we have him here
for a little while longer,

824
00:46:46,344 --> 00:46:49,447
Camden, do you
wanna let them hear

825
00:46:49,448 --> 00:46:52,481
what we have been working on?

826
00:46:52,482 --> 00:46:54,067
I don't think it's ready.

827
00:46:54,068 --> 00:46:56,171
What? Oh, my God.

828
00:46:56,172 --> 00:46:59,412
Be confident, be sure. Come on!

829
00:46:59,413 --> 00:47:00,516
Okay.

830
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:01,517
Come on.

831
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,550
I mean, it's just a
simple call and response,

832
00:47:13,551 --> 00:47:16,826
but you know, Ivy's voice
doesn't really need much extra.

833
00:47:16,827 --> 00:47:18,309
Oh, gosh.

834
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:19,481

- Camden, you should sing more.
- Great.

854
00:48:25,206 --> 00:48:28,067
Oh, well, Ivy wanted a duet.

855
00:48:28,068 --> 00:48:29,723
I'm just laying
down scratch vocals

856
00:48:29,724 --> 00:48:32,550
until we find another
artist, a real one.

857
00:48:32,551 --> 00:48:34,585
Royce, now I told him

858
00:48:34,586 --> 00:48:36,895
that I want him on
the actual track,

859
00:48:36,896 --> 00:48:39,620
but yet, he just won't budge!

860
00:48:40,448 --> 00:48:42,205
You're anointed, son.

861
00:48:42,206 --> 00:48:43,964
I see why Royce
brought you here.

862
00:48:43,965 --> 00:48:46,067
And I also see why they
can't get enough of you.

863
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:48,619
You also see why his
song "Born To Worship"

864
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,895
is number one on the
billboard gospel chart?

865
00:48:50,896 --> 00:48:52,206
- Hmm!
- Oh, man.

866
00:48:53,275 --> 00:48:54,550
What?

867
00:48:54,551 --> 00:48:57,033
- There you go.
- Congratulations.

868
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:58,034
Wow.

869
00:48:59,758 --> 00:49:01,930
Will y'all excuse me
while I make a quick call?

870
00:49:01,931 --> 00:49:04,447
Sure. Right down the
hall is my office.

871
00:49:04,448 --> 00:49:05,930
Second door on the right.

872
00:49:05,931 --> 00:49:06,965
Thank you.

873
00:49:18,103 --> 00:49:19,136
Yo?

874
00:49:19,137 --> 00:49:20,826
Did you hear, bro?

875
00:49:20,827 --> 00:49:21,827
Number one!

876
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,033
Yeah, of course I heard bro.

877
00:49:24,034 --> 00:49:25,309
We've been watching
the charts every day

878
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:27,309
since the single came out.

879
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:28,310
We over here busting our butt,

880
00:49:28,311 --> 00:49:29,550
while you chillin' in Atlanta.

881
00:49:29,551 --> 00:49:31,516
- Here you go, baby.
- Thank you.

882
00:49:31,517 --> 00:49:34,447
I wish! I've been
working hard too.

883
00:49:34,448 --> 00:49:36,309
I just did a song
with Ivy Whitlow!

884
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:38,965
Ooh, Ivy Whitlow.

885
00:49:39,862 --> 00:49:41,136
Dude she...

886
00:49:41,137 --> 00:49:43,205
she fine as hell!

887
00:49:43,206 --> 00:49:44,137
You hit that?

888
00:49:44,138 --> 00:49:45,654
Seriously?

889
00:49:45,655 --> 00:49:47,171
Out of the mouths of pastors!

890
00:49:47,172 --> 00:49:48,723
Don't judge me, bro.

891
00:49:48,724 --> 00:49:51,826
I'm still a man trying to
change his childish ways.

892
00:49:51,827 --> 00:49:53,481
God loves me, okay?

893
00:49:53,482 --> 00:49:55,136
Oh, yeah, Dad worked
it out with Royce

894
00:49:55,137 --> 00:49:57,654
for us to come out there to
work on some new music with him.

895
00:49:57,655 --> 00:50:01,412
Might be dropping a EP since
the single's going crazy!

896
00:50:01,413 --> 00:50:02,413
Dope, right?

897
00:50:03,103 --> 00:50:04,103
Yeah.

898
00:50:04,965 --> 00:50:06,654
Your girl misses you, bro.

899
00:50:06,655 --> 00:50:07,964
She'd love to see you.

900
00:50:07,965 --> 00:50:09,000
Can't tell.

901
00:50:10,137 --> 00:50:12,343
Felt like she
barely speaks to me.

902
00:50:12,344 --> 00:50:13,344
Oh.

903
00:50:14,517 --> 00:50:15,517
Yeah.

904
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:19,378
A'ight, bro, I gotta go.

905
00:50:19,379 --> 00:50:22,309
Congrats. Love
you, miss you, man.

906
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,964
I love you back bro.

907
00:50:23,965 --> 00:50:25,481
Why you always in my business?

908
00:50:25,482 --> 00:50:27,274
- I saw you checking her out.
- I didn't check her out.

909
00:50:27,275 --> 00:50:29,964
I was like this, like
it was, I almost fell.

910
00:50:29,965 --> 00:50:31,033
- I'm over you.
- Like my neck

911
00:50:31,034 --> 00:50:32,826
- almost fell back.
- Yeah.

912
00:50:32,827 --> 00:50:35,205
Just checking on you.
Is everything okay?

913
00:50:35,206 --> 00:50:37,930
Yeah. I just had
to call my brother.

914
00:50:37,931 --> 00:50:39,447
This is huge for us.

915
00:50:39,448 --> 00:50:41,688
This is a special
moment. You deserve it.

916
00:50:41,689 --> 00:50:43,033
Thank you.

917
00:50:43,034 --> 00:50:44,964
I know that you're used to this.

918
00:50:44,965 --> 00:50:46,723
You pump out hit after hit.

919
00:50:46,724 --> 00:50:50,481
Thanks to you I'll
have a new hit.

920
00:50:50,482 --> 00:50:52,861
It's been a while since
I felt connected to music

921
00:50:52,862 --> 00:50:55,481
the way that I did with yours.

922
00:50:55,482 --> 00:50:58,343
It's also been a while since
I felt connected to a man

923
00:50:58,344 --> 00:51:00,413
the way I feel with you.

924
00:51:01,896 --> 00:51:04,171
- Dr. Whitlow is...
- He's a wonderful pastor

925
00:51:04,172 --> 00:51:08,034
and a great leader, but
he just doesn't see me.

926
00:51:10,758 --> 00:51:12,550
He doesn't make me feel as alive

927
00:51:12,551 --> 00:51:14,689
as I do when I'm with you.

928
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,206
Ivy! Hey!

929
00:51:28,517 --> 00:51:29,999
Your husband's down the hall.

930
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,550
Shh!

931
00:51:31,551 --> 00:51:34,412
I can get us a room at the
Four Seasons in two minutes.

932
00:51:34,413 --> 00:51:37,379
- I have a girlfriend...
- Who isn't here.

933
00:51:40,862 --> 00:51:42,171
Ivy!

934
00:51:42,172 --> 00:51:44,000
Wow. You're serious.

935
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:49,689
Okay.

936
00:51:59,206 --> 00:52:01,102
Well welcome to
the Dr. Ray Show.

937
00:52:01,103 --> 00:52:04,102
And today, Ivy Whitlow, finally,

938
00:52:04,103 --> 00:52:06,964
- I have you sitting on my set.
- Yes.

939
00:52:06,965 --> 00:52:08,412
I've been trying to
get you here for years.

940
00:52:08,413 --> 00:52:09,895
- Really, thank you.
- I'm honored.

941
00:52:09,896 --> 00:52:11,757
I am so honored to have you.

942
00:52:11,758 --> 00:52:12,999
It's a pleasure.

943
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,102
Do you mind if we
just jump right in?

944
00:52:14,103 --> 00:52:15,412
Go ahead, girl.

945
00:52:15,413 --> 00:52:18,930
Right now there's a
very interesting dynamic

946
00:52:18,931 --> 00:52:20,516
going on in gospel music.

947
00:52:20,517 --> 00:52:22,999
There is. And Royce London.

948
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,274
- Oh!
- He is a powerhouse, honey.

949
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:26,516
Always has been.

950
00:52:26,517 --> 00:52:30,999
Now Royce London is a
very, eccentric man of God.

951
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,447
Oh yeah. Well that's
one way to put it.

952
00:52:33,448 --> 00:52:35,343
Yeah, I get it.

953
00:52:35,344 --> 00:52:37,274
- Now Ivy.
- Yeah?

954
00:52:37,275 --> 00:52:40,309
For years there have been
rumors floating around.

955
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:42,516
- Okay.
- That Mr. Royce London

956
00:52:42,517 --> 00:52:46,103
has women running in
and out of the studio.

957
00:52:47,275 --> 00:52:50,102
That he takes on
young female artists

958
00:52:50,103 --> 00:52:52,447
for his own personal pleasure?

959
00:52:52,448 --> 00:52:54,619
Now, he's my friend
and he's a great guy.

960
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,309
- Okay?
- Okay, okay, okay.

961
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:57,412
- Okay.
- Why don't we talk about

962
00:52:57,413 --> 00:52:59,447
- other producers?
- Sure.

963
00:52:59,448 --> 00:53:01,481
- Like his latest edition?
- Okay.

964
00:53:01,482 --> 00:53:04,516
Mr. Camden Wilson, out of
Dallas.

965
00:53:04,517 --> 00:53:05,792
- Hmm.
- His personal life

966
00:53:05,793 --> 00:53:06,964
is very ambiguous.

967
00:53:06,965 --> 00:53:09,309
He's got no real
social media presence.

968
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:10,861
True.

969
00:53:10,862 --> 00:53:14,481
But he's a great songwriter
and he has a girlfriend.

970
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:15,344
- Okay.
- Okay?

971
00:53:15,345 --> 00:53:16,827
- So let's...
- Well...

972
00:53:17,931 --> 00:53:20,343
So you've never seen
him with a lot of women?

973
00:53:20,344 --> 00:53:22,999
Well, I'm not saying that.

974
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,516
I'm just doing a song with him.

975
00:53:25,517 --> 00:53:28,826
He has had some girls
in and out of there.

976
00:53:28,827 --> 00:53:29,827
Oh!

977
00:53:30,482 --> 00:53:31,688
I'll say that much.

978
00:53:31,689 --> 00:53:34,550
Okay, so Ivy, come on.

979
00:53:34,551 --> 00:53:37,688
You can tell me!

980
00:53:37,689 --> 00:53:42,343
Have you ever seen anything
suspect going on in the studio?

981
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:45,171
Well, I don't really
know the guy like that

982
00:53:45,172 --> 00:53:48,654
but I'll tell you this, all
those late night sessions?

983
00:53:48,655 --> 00:53:50,205
- Yeah.
- With all those chicks.

984
00:53:50,206 --> 00:53:51,481
- Yeah.
- Like come on.

985
00:53:51,482 --> 00:53:54,895
I haven't heard not
one song on the radio.

986
00:53:54,896 --> 00:53:56,171
Now let's just get back

987
00:53:56,172 --> 00:53:58,999
- on my project, okay?
- Okay.

988
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,550
- Thank you.
- Well, Let's talk about

989
00:54:00,551 --> 00:54:03,309
- your latest single shall we?
- Yes, absolutely.

990
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:04,965
I'm so glad she's here.

991
00:54:05,103 --> 00:54:07,033
I can't believe this!

992
00:54:07,034 --> 00:54:09,412
My girl's gonna kill me.

993
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:11,067
What did you expect?

994
00:54:11,068 --> 00:54:13,412
Here, you need this.

995
00:54:13,413 --> 00:54:14,895
What are you talking about?

996
00:54:14,896 --> 00:54:16,309
The endless flirting.

997
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:19,274
Prioritizing her music,
giving her all your free time.

998
00:54:19,275 --> 00:54:21,205
I kept it strictly professional.

999
00:54:21,206 --> 00:54:23,550
Okay. But she hasn't.

1000
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:25,240
Look, I'm a musician.

1001
00:54:25,241 --> 00:54:26,516
I have a girlfriend.

1002
00:54:26,517 --> 00:54:28,136
She's married.

1003
00:54:28,137 --> 00:54:29,896
I came for the music.

1004
00:54:30,758 --> 00:54:32,861
And she came for something else.

1005
00:54:32,862 --> 00:54:34,619
And you turned her down.

1006
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,931
Let me guess, you didn't?

1007
00:54:40,586 --> 00:54:41,551
Ivy...

1008
00:54:41,552 --> 00:54:43,240
Ivy can be poison.

1009
00:54:43,241 --> 00:54:47,586
No, Ivy can be a drug,
and I was hooked.

1010
00:54:48,448 --> 00:54:51,067
But time has passed, we
moved on, we worked it out.

1011
00:54:51,068 --> 00:54:53,067
And then you show up.

1012
00:54:53,068 --> 00:54:57,240
Bright-eyed, sanctified,
fresh for the picking.

1013
00:54:57,241 --> 00:54:59,723
So I'm just supposed to
sit back and do nothing?

1014
00:54:59,724 --> 00:55:01,309
I'm sorry,

1015
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:03,964
I'm not as comfortable with
false accusations as you are.

1016
00:55:03,965 --> 00:55:06,964
- This is my reputation.
- This is the business.

1017
00:55:06,965 --> 00:55:08,619
Rumors float around
about every male artist.

1018
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,999
Some true, others
wishful thinking.

1019
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,136
You gotta get tougher skin.

1020
00:55:13,137 --> 00:55:15,826
This industry says God first,
but it's business first.

1021
00:55:15,827 --> 00:55:17,792
And if you don't get your
business under control

1022
00:55:17,793 --> 00:55:20,550
it's gonna get control of you.

1023
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:23,136
And how am I
supposed to do that?

1024
00:55:23,137 --> 00:55:26,481
You might wanna start
by taking care of home.

1025
00:55:40,793 --> 00:55:43,344
You see that body over there?

1026
00:55:47,241 --> 00:55:48,241
Hey!

1027
00:55:52,793 --> 00:55:54,103
- Oh my...
- No.

1028
00:55:54,793 --> 00:55:55,793
God.

1029
00:55:55,965 --> 00:55:58,309
Don't look at me like that.

1030
00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:00,861
I'm self-conscious enough.

1031
00:56:00,862 --> 00:56:02,412
I went shopping
with Amber earlier

1032
00:56:02,413 --> 00:56:05,274
and she convinced me that
this dress looks good.

1033
00:56:05,275 --> 00:56:06,757
It's too much?

1034
00:56:06,758 --> 00:56:10,033
- No, no, you look nice.
- It's,

1035
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:12,412
- Nice.
- You look really nice.

1036
00:56:12,413 --> 00:56:13,862
- Like, nice.
- Ooh.

1037
00:56:15,517 --> 00:56:16,585
- Yo, B?
- What?

1038
00:56:16,586 --> 00:56:18,102
Thank your dad again, man.

1039
00:56:18,103 --> 00:56:20,895
This is like the nicest hotel
in this state here bruh.

1040
00:56:20,896 --> 00:56:23,412
Offerings must be
looking right on Sundays.

1041
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:25,516
Bro, it's the church we
sing at that covers us.

1042
00:56:25,517 --> 00:56:26,757
Not us.

1043
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,861
Either way, I'm straight.

1044
00:56:28,862 --> 00:56:30,757
Look, I'm just here for the
steak and the lobster stuff.

1045
00:56:32,344 --> 00:56:33,861
I want one of those pretty
drinks with the umbrella

1046
00:56:33,862 --> 00:56:35,343
and all the food up in it.

1047
00:56:35,344 --> 00:56:37,516
Except for strawberries.

1048
00:56:37,517 --> 00:56:38,517
Dawn?

1049
00:56:39,241 --> 00:56:40,861
You okay?

1050
00:56:40,862 --> 00:56:43,033
Yeah, I'm good.

1051
00:56:43,034 --> 00:56:43,862
I'm good.

1052
00:56:43,863 --> 00:56:45,689
I'm good, y'all, Stop!

1053
00:56:48,241 --> 00:56:50,171
What? I'm good.

1054
00:56:50,172 --> 00:56:51,550
I'm good.

1055
00:56:51,551 --> 00:56:52,792
So how long are we
supposed to act like

1056
00:56:52,793 --> 00:56:54,033
we didn't see Dr.
Ray's interview?

1057
00:56:54,034 --> 00:56:55,861
Yo, Akil, man, come on bro.

1058
00:56:55,862 --> 00:56:57,516
Just saying.

1059
00:56:57,517 --> 00:56:59,862
- Oh.
- Thank you, thank you.

1060
00:57:01,931 --> 00:57:03,447
I just don't like
them insinuating

1061
00:57:03,448 --> 00:57:05,447
that all church boys
do is sleep around.

1062
00:57:05,448 --> 00:57:06,619
That's all you do.

1063
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,999
Hey, hey, I respect women.

1064
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,240
That means nothing if you
don't call them the next day.

1065
00:57:11,241 --> 00:57:12,516
What?

1066
00:57:12,517 --> 00:57:14,481
I just think that she
was coming for Camden.

1067
00:57:14,482 --> 00:57:18,447
And Royce, I mean, he's
an OG and so anointed.

1068
00:57:18,448 --> 00:57:19,448
Hold up.

1069
00:57:19,449 --> 00:57:20,688
To be anointed and talented

1070
00:57:20,689 --> 00:57:22,274
are two completely
different things.

1071
00:57:22,275 --> 00:57:23,481
Facts.

1072
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:24,757
Just because you
throw God up in there

1073
00:57:24,758 --> 00:57:26,447
- don't make one the other.
- Right.

1074
00:57:26,448 --> 00:57:29,067
- It's what I'm talking about.
- You should know.

1075
00:57:29,068 --> 00:57:30,792
See, God don't like that either.

1076
00:57:30,793 --> 00:57:34,240
But, what reason does she
have to go there with Camden?

1077
00:57:34,241 --> 00:57:35,654
I don't know.

1078
00:57:35,655 --> 00:57:38,585
But one thing we all
know, Camden's not like...

1079
00:57:38,586 --> 00:57:40,826
- What?
- Yo, what?

1080
00:57:40,827 --> 00:57:42,516
Nothing.

1081
00:57:42,517 --> 00:57:43,964
-Dawn-
-Amber, Amber, Amber,

1082
00:57:43,965 --> 00:57:45,378
are you okay?

1083
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:46,895
Yeah. Why?

1084
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:48,241
No. Your face.

1085
00:57:50,586 --> 00:57:52,067
- You see that.
- Oh my God,

1086
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:53,274
- you're breaking out in hives!
- What!

1087
00:57:53,275 --> 00:57:56,103
- Waitress.
- Oh my God, what is...

1088
00:57:57,689 --> 00:57:59,067
Where there strawberries
in that drink?

1089
00:57:59,068 --> 00:58:00,585
Because she said
no strawberries.

1090
00:58:00,586 --> 00:58:02,171
No, I actually told them
to take strawberries

1091
00:58:02,172 --> 00:58:03,895
off of the cup.

1092
00:58:03,896 --> 00:58:06,654
She's allergic to the juice
in the strawberries too.

1093
00:58:06,655 --> 00:58:09,413
I am so, so sorry.

1094
00:58:09,689 --> 00:58:13,309
Come on, I got some
medicine in my room.

1095
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:14,516
Do you guys want us
to come with you too?

1096
00:58:14,517 --> 00:58:16,205
- Yeah, we can help you.
- No, I'm fine.

1097
00:58:16,206 --> 00:58:17,654
You guys hang out.

1098
00:58:17,655 --> 00:58:18,964
They're still bringing dessert.

1099
00:58:18,965 --> 00:58:20,999
Oh, that's exactly
what I plan to do.

1100
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,516
Find me some dessert.

1101
00:58:22,517 --> 00:58:23,723
- You know what I'm saying
-That's my boy!

1102
00:58:23,724 --> 00:58:24,620
Amber, are you sure?

1103
00:58:24,621 --> 00:58:25,964
Meet me at the room later.

1104
00:58:25,965 --> 00:58:27,654
You need to unwind.

1105
00:58:27,655 --> 00:58:29,171
You show our girl a good time.

1106
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,205
Easy.

1107
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:31,378
- See he treats you good.
- Take care of her.

1108
00:58:31,379 --> 00:58:33,310
You take care of her.

1109
00:58:37,482 --> 00:58:38,551
Really?

1110
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:41,724
No.

1111
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,136
You know, we ain't paying
for none of this, right?

1112
00:58:44,137 --> 00:58:46,171
Look, Akil got
everything comped.

1113
00:58:46,172 --> 00:58:47,000
Okay.

1114
00:58:47,001 --> 00:58:48,205
Okay? No.

1115
00:58:48,206 --> 00:58:50,481
And it's not the
waitresses fault.

1116
00:58:50,482 --> 00:58:53,000
It absolutely was her fault.

1117
00:58:54,137 --> 00:58:55,792
- How?
- Typical.

1118
00:58:55,793 --> 00:58:56,793
What?

1119
00:58:57,551 --> 00:58:59,654
She's cute. She's pretty.

1120
00:58:59,655 --> 00:59:02,033
She'll always get a pass.

1121
00:59:02,034 --> 00:59:04,309
I mean yeah, she a'ight, but
she ain't my type!

1122
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:06,895
Please, she's every
man's type, come on.

1123
00:59:06,896 --> 00:59:08,723
No, she's not.

1124
00:59:08,724 --> 00:59:10,240
Are you kidding me?

1125
00:59:10,241 --> 00:59:12,792
- No.
- I wish I looked like her.

1126
00:59:12,793 --> 00:59:14,723
What do you mean?

1127
00:59:14,724 --> 00:59:16,240
D, what are you talking about?

1128
00:59:16,241 --> 00:59:18,517
You're perfect just
the way you are.

1129
00:59:19,241 --> 00:59:21,102
I mean, who would have
known what you was hiding

1130
00:59:21,103 --> 00:59:24,757
under them choir robes and
little liturgical dance dresses

1131
00:59:24,758 --> 00:59:26,895
- and all the things you...
- Shut up!

1132
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:27,793
Just sayin'.

1133
00:59:27,794 --> 00:59:29,240
I do not wear any of that.

1134
00:59:29,241 --> 00:59:30,137
What are you talking about?

1135
00:59:30,138 --> 00:59:32,343
You do be buttoned up though.

1136
00:59:32,344 --> 00:59:33,550
Oh my God.

1137
00:59:33,551 --> 00:59:34,895
Okay. I be covered up.

1138
00:59:34,896 --> 00:59:37,481
Oh my God. That's my point.

1139
00:59:37,482 --> 00:59:39,274
You don't need all that.

1140
00:59:39,275 --> 00:59:41,723
Maybe if Cam saw what
he was working with

1141
00:59:41,724 --> 00:59:44,378
y'all be running down
the aisle right now.

1142
00:59:44,379 --> 00:59:47,826
What reasonable man
would resist all of that?

1143
00:59:47,827 --> 00:59:51,274
I'm waiting till
marriage, you know that.

1144
00:59:51,275 --> 00:59:52,792
No, I get it. It's honorable.

1145
00:59:52,793 --> 00:59:56,378
I just do not know how my
brother held out this long.

1146
00:59:56,379 --> 01:00:00,551
What man, what reasonable
man can resist all that?

1147
01:00:01,655 --> 01:00:05,724
- That boy's saved-saved, man.
- I mean, I should be happy

1148
01:00:07,068 --> 01:00:11,826
that I have a man that
respects my virginity, but,

1149
01:00:11,827 --> 01:00:14,792
like we never even
been hot and heavy

1150
01:00:14,793 --> 01:00:16,723
if you know what I mean?

1151
01:00:16,724 --> 01:00:19,861
My brother's always been
the cautious one. Right?

1152
01:00:19,862 --> 01:00:21,033
It's a gift and a curse.

1153
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,723
Yeah, but to what end?

1154
01:00:23,724 --> 01:00:27,688
Sometimes a woman just
wants to feel like a woman.

1155
01:00:27,689 --> 01:00:29,517
I mean, virgin or not.

1156
01:00:31,241 --> 01:00:33,067
I don't know why I'm
telling you all this?

1157
01:00:33,068 --> 01:00:36,550
Oh, 'cause you know you
can tell me anything.

1158
01:00:36,551 --> 01:00:39,000
We go back, D.

1159
01:00:41,206 --> 01:00:42,654
It's been rough.

1160
01:00:42,655 --> 01:00:44,550
I wasn't trying to put
our business out there

1161
01:00:44,551 --> 01:00:49,551
but we've barely talked
in the past few weeks.

1162
01:00:50,758 --> 01:00:52,067
I mean, he just
started blowing me up

1163
01:00:52,068 --> 01:00:53,034
when that blog dropped.

1164
01:00:53,035 --> 01:00:54,585
What am I supposed to think?

1165
01:00:54,586 --> 01:00:57,792
That you have a man that
loves you and you trust him?

1166
01:00:57,793 --> 01:00:59,274
Yeah, that makes
me feel invisible

1167
01:00:59,275 --> 01:01:01,620
even when he's in the room.

1168
01:01:02,724 --> 01:01:05,620
Is it wrong to just
wanna feel sexy?

1169
01:01:06,551 --> 01:01:10,171
To want somebody that wants me
and ain't afraid to show it?

1170
01:01:10,172 --> 01:01:13,620
I mean, damn, can I
get a little passion?

1171
01:01:16,413 --> 01:01:17,275
I'm sorry.

1172
01:01:17,276 --> 01:01:18,481
I'm rambling.

1173
01:01:18,482 --> 01:01:21,826
No, no, no, no, no,
look, look, look.

1174
01:01:21,827 --> 01:01:22,793
I get it.

1175
01:01:22,794 --> 01:01:24,481
You wanna feel like a woman?

1176
01:01:24,482 --> 01:01:26,654
You wanna man that desires you

1177
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:29,620
and with my brother,
you can't tell.

1178
01:01:34,448 --> 01:01:35,930
What if it's true, Blaine?

1179
01:01:35,931 --> 01:01:36,931
No.

1180
01:01:37,793 --> 01:01:38,793
No!

1181
01:01:40,793 --> 01:01:41,793
Look.

1182
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:43,965
Put this down.

1183
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:47,136
Look, all right.

1184
01:01:47,137 --> 01:01:49,792
I don't know what
that chick's deal is.

1185
01:01:49,793 --> 01:01:52,827
My brother, he
doesn't sleep around.

1186
01:01:53,965 --> 01:01:55,793
He's waiting for you!

1187
01:01:57,206 --> 01:01:59,827
Why? He doesn't even want me?

1188
01:02:09,206 --> 01:02:10,206
Come on.

1189
01:02:14,275 --> 01:02:15,516
Damn, no.

1190
01:02:17,068 --> 01:02:18,343
Wait, wait, let me do the moves,

1191
01:02:18,344 --> 01:02:19,861
let me do the moves,
wait, wait, wait.

1192
01:02:19,862 --> 01:02:21,585
Hips, hips, uh, uh.

1193
01:02:21,586 --> 01:02:23,102
Okay, then you,
wait, wait, wait.

1194
01:02:23,103 --> 01:02:24,654
Eeh, eeh.

1195
01:02:24,655 --> 01:02:26,205
Okay, mm, mm.

1196
01:02:27,896 --> 01:02:29,619
You know I did it
good, don't judge me.

1197
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,723
All right, at least
we're dancin' now,

1198
01:02:31,724 --> 01:02:33,654
at least we're movin' our feet.

1199
01:02:33,655 --> 01:02:34,826
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry for

1200
01:02:34,827 --> 01:02:36,516
talking your ear off all night.

1201
01:02:36,517 --> 01:02:37,654
No.

1202
01:02:37,655 --> 01:02:38,826
I think that drink was
a little bit stronger

1203
01:02:38,827 --> 01:02:40,033
- than I thought.
- No, come on, D,

1204
01:02:40,034 --> 01:02:41,447
it's nothin', I'm here.

1205
01:02:41,448 --> 01:02:44,447
It's what a future pastor's
supposed to do, right?

1206
01:02:44,448 --> 01:02:47,067
Isn't it just so hard

1207
01:02:47,068 --> 01:02:50,102
always trying to be so perfect?

1208
01:02:50,103 --> 01:02:52,689
Wait,

1209
01:02:52,862 --> 01:02:54,689
Dawn, yo, nobody's perfect.

1210
01:02:55,172 --> 01:02:56,931
We all make mistakes.

1211
01:02:59,689 --> 01:03:03,758
Lord knows, I have.

1212
01:03:05,586 --> 01:03:09,482
Sometimes, I feel like
I haven't made enough.

1213
01:03:12,448 --> 01:03:17,102
Well, what do you mean?

1214
01:03:17,103 --> 01:03:19,654
Dawn, Dawn, Dawn, Dawn.

1215
01:03:19,655 --> 01:03:21,102
We can't do that.

1216
01:03:21,103 --> 01:03:22,481
- All right, all right.
- No I'm sorry, I'm so stupid.

1217
01:03:22,482 --> 01:03:26,102
You're not stupid.
You're far from stupid.

1218
01:03:26,103 --> 01:03:28,103

You guys were hanging late, huh?

1228
01:05:05,413 --> 01:05:07,448
Where were you all night?

1229
01:05:12,103 --> 01:05:13,103
What?

1230
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:20,964
What in the hell were
you thinking about?

1231
01:06:20,965 --> 01:06:22,033
It just happened, Dad!

1232
01:06:22,034 --> 01:06:23,826
Nobody's buying records

1233
01:06:23,827 --> 01:06:26,205
or following a pastor
with a baby mama.

1234
01:06:26,206 --> 01:06:29,481
Maybe we can just explain
everything to Camden.

1235
01:06:29,482 --> 01:06:31,171
Ma, he loves her.
He'll still marry her!

1236
01:06:31,172 --> 01:06:33,964
- You can't be this stupid.
- What?

1237
01:06:33,965 --> 01:06:35,205
He may never forgive her.

1238
01:06:35,206 --> 01:06:37,378
- Or you.
- Oh, stop yelling.

1239
01:06:37,379 --> 01:06:40,343
This was bound to happen the
way you let him run around

1240
01:06:40,344 --> 01:06:42,033
like God's gift to women.

1241
01:06:42,034 --> 01:06:43,619
Just shameful.

1242
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:45,688
I just never thought that you
would have been stupid enough

1243
01:06:45,689 --> 01:06:47,654
to let it happen with
your brother's girlfriend!

1244
01:06:47,655 --> 01:06:49,619
Mom, Mom, I know. I'm sorry.

1245
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:53,585
It, it just, well maybe
she could just step down

1246
01:06:53,586 --> 01:06:55,136
from "SO G-I-F-T-E-D"?

1247
01:06:55,137 --> 01:06:57,688
- The group will understand!
- The group?

1248
01:06:57,689 --> 01:07:00,861
The family legacy, that's
what's on the line.

1249
01:07:00,862 --> 01:07:02,412
So she has to make the
sacrifice?

1250
01:07:02,413 --> 01:07:03,895
Something has to be done.

1251
01:07:03,896 --> 01:07:05,171
What about Camden?

1252
01:07:05,172 --> 01:07:07,895
Oh, now you wanna
think about Camden?

1253
01:07:07,896 --> 01:07:10,344
You will take care of this.

1254
01:07:16,379 --> 01:07:17,655
Come on, Dad.

1255
01:07:22,758 --> 01:07:25,137
Do the right thing.

1256
01:07:26,034 --> 01:07:27,034
Okay, Mom.

1257
01:07:40,551 --> 01:07:42,655
Cam Deezy! I missed you!

1258
01:07:43,517 --> 01:07:44,551
What's up?

1259
01:07:46,689 --> 01:07:48,723
Man, I hate I haven't
been gigging with y'all.

1260
01:07:48,724 --> 01:07:50,619
Oh, please, man.

1261
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:53,205
You're way too busy to
be giggin' with us, dog.

1262
01:07:53,206 --> 01:07:54,103
Well, listen, listen.

1263
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:55,034
Don't even worry. All right?

1264
01:07:55,035 --> 01:07:56,516
You ain't even missed much.

1265
01:07:56,517 --> 01:07:59,757
Just, you know, crowds of
adorin' fans, five star hotels,

1266
01:07:59,758 --> 01:08:01,895
and you know, scrumptious
meals and all that man.

1267
01:08:01,896 --> 01:08:03,619
Yeah, rub it in, rub it in.

1268
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:05,412
- Love you man!
- Oh, man!

1269
01:08:05,413 --> 01:08:06,550
- Good to see you.
- My boy!

1270
01:08:06,551 --> 01:08:07,551
Ow!

1271
01:08:08,931 --> 01:08:10,447
- What's up man!
- I missed you.

1272
01:08:10,448 --> 01:08:12,619
Missed you too, man, you
still lookin' weird as hell.

1273
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:13,620
Boy, what they
feedin' you on here?

1274
01:08:13,621 --> 01:08:14,826
Man, here we go.

1275
01:08:14,827 --> 01:08:16,067
You the one who's
gainin' all this weight.

1276
01:08:16,068 --> 01:08:17,481
You liftin' all
them ladies, boy?

1277
01:08:17,482 --> 01:08:18,448
Somethin' like that.

1278
01:08:18,449 --> 01:08:20,102
- Yeah.
- What.

1279
01:08:24,275 --> 01:08:26,585
- Hey.
- What's up?

1280
01:08:26,586 --> 01:08:28,551
Hey, I missed you babe.

1281
01:08:29,413 --> 01:08:30,413
I...

1282
01:08:30,448 --> 01:08:32,067
You good?

1283
01:08:32,068 --> 01:08:35,792
Yeah, just had a
long, rough flight.

1284
01:08:35,793 --> 01:08:37,240
Well look, come on,

1285
01:08:37,241 --> 01:08:39,792
I wanna show all of y'all
this amazing studio, bro.

1286
01:08:39,793 --> 01:08:40,620
It's crazy.

1287
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:41,586
Go get the bags.

1288
01:08:53,137 --> 01:08:54,757
-I have to tell you somethin'
-I gotta tell you something.

1289
01:08:54,758 --> 01:08:55,930
- Go ahead.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1290
01:08:55,931 --> 01:08:57,757
No, you go first.

1291
01:08:57,758 --> 01:08:59,136
Okay.

1292
01:08:59,137 --> 01:09:01,757
Look, I know I'm
constantly talking to you

1293
01:09:01,758 --> 01:09:05,412
about being patient
and I want you to know

1294
01:09:05,413 --> 01:09:07,688
I really appreciate it.

1295
01:09:07,689 --> 01:09:10,826
Listen, you've been waiting for
me while I figure out a plan

1296
01:09:10,827 --> 01:09:14,379
and get clarity on what
God wants me to do.

1297
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:17,861
And I appreciate that babe.

1298
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:19,206
More than I say.

1299
01:09:22,379 --> 01:09:24,516
What I'm trying to say is,

1300
01:09:24,517 --> 01:09:27,137
-Dawn, I love you-
-Camden stop!

1301
01:09:30,137 --> 01:09:32,412
Look, I've had a lot
of time to think,

1302
01:09:32,413 --> 01:09:36,103
and you being away has
given me some clarity

1303
01:09:37,586 --> 01:09:40,205
on what I want and
what I deserve.

1304
01:09:40,206 --> 01:09:42,861
Dawn, I know what
this is about, and...

1305
01:09:42,862 --> 01:09:44,827
There's someone else.

1306
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:47,724
Really?

1307
01:09:49,655 --> 01:09:53,793
It wasn't planned,
it just... happened.

1308
01:09:54,034 --> 01:09:55,136
Who is he?

1309
01:09:55,137 --> 01:09:56,861
It doesn't matter.

1310
01:09:56,862 --> 01:09:58,826
If this is about you
being ready for marriage...

1311
01:09:58,827 --> 01:10:03,655
No, I just, I want
something else...

1312
01:10:05,379 --> 01:10:07,275
Someone else.

1313
01:10:08,206 --> 01:10:11,000
And this, it's not gonna work.

1314
01:10:13,068 --> 01:10:15,103
Not for me. Not anymore.

1315
01:10:19,344 --> 01:10:20,344
I'm sorry.

1316
01:10:21,827 --> 01:10:23,896
I should go, I should go.

1317
01:10:52,413 --> 01:10:54,481
House, house, bro.

1318
01:10:54,482 --> 01:10:56,240
Proud of what you did, man.

1319
01:10:56,241 --> 01:11:00,861
It's dope, man. You did well
for yourself, partner.

1320
01:11:00,862 --> 01:11:02,412
What is it?

1321
01:11:02,413 --> 01:11:04,206
No matter what I do...

1322
01:11:06,241 --> 01:11:09,447
You know, I came down here
tryin' to answer the call,

1323
01:11:09,448 --> 01:11:12,619
set up a life, a
situation for me and Dawn.

1324
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:13,792
Proved to Dad that I'm...

1325
01:11:13,793 --> 01:11:15,723
What are you talking about?

1326
01:11:15,724 --> 01:11:17,965
She broke up with me, man.

1327
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,792
Dawn says

1328
01:11:20,793 --> 01:11:21,964
there's someone else.

1329
01:11:21,965 --> 01:11:23,412
We're done.

1330
01:11:27,931 --> 01:11:29,205
Did you know?

1331
01:11:29,206 --> 01:11:31,654
What? No, bruh!

1332
01:11:31,655 --> 01:11:35,309
No, man, you know, I
would have told you.

1333
01:11:35,310 --> 01:11:36,379
Are you okay?

1334
01:11:38,448 --> 01:11:41,067
Hey, what's going on over here?

1335
01:11:41,068 --> 01:11:43,413
Dawn broke up with Camden.

1336
01:11:49,068 --> 01:11:50,309
Did you know?

1337
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:53,793
Man, it's a shock to
everybody, you know?

1338
01:11:55,379 --> 01:11:56,586
But, um...

1339
01:11:58,034 --> 01:12:00,310
everything happens for a reason.

1340
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:03,965
Just know we love you, hear me?

1341
01:12:21,206 --> 01:12:23,274
Tonight was the night.

1342
01:12:23,275 --> 01:12:24,275
For?

1343
01:12:31,758 --> 01:12:32,758
Camden.

1344
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,274
Listen, you wanna put this
on the hand of the woman

1345
01:12:38,275 --> 01:12:41,481
who will truly love you
for the rest of your life.

1346
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:44,827
If she's not the one,
she's not the one.

1347
01:12:46,689 --> 01:12:47,757
This is my fault.

1348
01:12:47,758 --> 01:12:49,827
No, no, no.

1349
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:53,964
I'm certain this has
nothing to do with you.

1350
01:12:53,965 --> 01:12:57,136
Sometimes people
just grow apart.

1351
01:12:57,137 --> 01:12:59,619
She might be doing you a favor.

1352
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:04,447
Better now than you two divorce
and hate each other later.

1353
01:13:04,448 --> 01:13:06,206
I thought she loved me.

1354
01:13:07,172 --> 01:13:08,172
I know.

1355
01:13:10,689 --> 01:13:12,758
Hey, you'll be all right.

1356
01:13:17,758 --> 01:13:19,827
You deserve better, Cam.

1357
01:13:24,517 --> 01:13:26,688
How can you be so sure?

1358
01:13:26,689 --> 01:13:28,551
Because, I know you.

1359
01:13:43,275 --> 01:13:45,102
Yo, what are you doing?
You're making a scene!

1360
01:13:45,103 --> 01:13:46,688
Yeah, really Blaine, really?

1361
01:13:46,689 --> 01:13:48,033
What? Is your future wife
already embarrassing you?

1362
01:13:48,034 --> 01:13:49,274
Look, calm down.

1363
01:13:49,275 --> 01:13:50,516
Look, if wanna go
back to the hotel

1364
01:13:50,517 --> 01:13:51,206
I'll just tell them
you're not feeling well,

1365
01:13:51,207 --> 01:13:52,378
- okay?
- No!

1366
01:13:52,379 --> 01:13:55,033
I just want this whole
nightmare to end!

1367
01:13:55,034 --> 01:13:56,516
This is all your fault!

1368
01:13:56,517 --> 01:13:57,448
My fault?!

1369
01:13:57,449 --> 01:13:59,378
I made you sleep with me?

1370
01:13:59,379 --> 01:14:01,274
You do what the hell
you wanted to do, man.

1371
01:14:01,275 --> 01:14:02,757
Yeah, and you think
that marrying you

1372
01:14:02,758 --> 01:14:04,585
was gonna fix everything?

1373
01:14:04,586 --> 01:14:06,171
You can take your
ring and go to hell!

1374
01:14:06,172 --> 01:14:08,619
What did you just say?

1375
01:14:10,482 --> 01:14:11,723
You slept with Dawn?

1376
01:14:11,724 --> 01:14:13,309
- Bro, it's not...
- Camden.

1377
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:15,136
- It didn't mean anything.
- Sorry man, it

1378
01:14:15,137 --> 01:14:16,343
I was, it just happened.

1379
01:14:16,344 --> 01:14:17,412
It just happened.

1380
01:14:17,413 --> 01:14:18,792
-Cam, one thing just
-Cam,

1381
01:14:18,793 --> 01:14:20,171
- led to another.
- It didn't mean anything.

1382
01:14:20,172 --> 01:14:21,412
- It didn't mean nothin'.
- Camden, look at me, I swear.

1383
01:14:21,413 --> 01:14:22,172
- Look.
- It didn't mean anything.

1384
01:14:22,173 --> 01:14:23,412
It didn't mean anything.

1385
01:14:23,413 --> 01:14:24,310
- It just happened.
- I swear bro.

1386
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:25,103
I swear, just talk to me!

1387
01:14:25,104 --> 01:14:26,655
No stop! No, stop!

1388
01:14:27,655 --> 01:14:28,930
Camden stop!

1389
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:30,102
Whoa, yo! No, no, no, no.

1390
01:14:30,103 --> 01:14:32,274
Get off of him!

1391
01:14:32,275 --> 01:14:33,586
Get off of him!

1392
01:14:36,275 --> 01:14:37,619
Yo, we're brothers man!

1393
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:38,654
Get off me man!

1394
01:14:38,655 --> 01:14:40,550
We're brothers!

1395
01:14:40,551 --> 01:14:42,000
You go to hell!

1396
01:14:44,551 --> 01:14:46,758
You didn't deserve this.

1397
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:54,724
I'm sorry.

1398
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:20,379
Sweetheart!

1399
01:15:21,241 --> 01:15:22,999
What are you doing?

1400
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,033
I can't find my
King James Version.

1401
01:15:25,034 --> 01:15:26,654
Oh!

1402
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:27,861
You about to meet King James

1403
01:15:27,862 --> 01:15:30,309
if you don't come
down from there.

1404
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:34,655
The doctor said no
strenuous activity.

1405
01:15:47,517 --> 01:15:50,000
Did you take your
heart medication?

1406
01:15:51,862 --> 01:15:55,792
So you just wanna go ahead
and give me a heart attack?

1407
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:23,586
Did you invite Camden to
the church anniversary yet?

1408
01:16:25,793 --> 01:16:26,793
Not yet.

1409
01:16:32,931 --> 01:16:36,379
Pick up the phone
and talk to your son.

1410
01:16:37,586 --> 01:16:41,206
The longer you wait the
harder it's gonna be.

1411
01:16:46,413 --> 01:16:47,931
I've forgiven you.

1412
01:16:50,413 --> 01:16:51,448
He will too.

1413
01:17:21,793 --> 01:17:24,136
♪ I was born to worship you

1414
01:17:24,137 --> 01:17:27,930
♪ To worship you, worship
you, worship you ♪

1415
01:17:27,931 --> 01:17:31,033
-♪ Ooh
-♪ My hands were made

1416
01:17:31,034 --> 01:17:33,136
♪ To worship you

1417
01:17:33,137 --> 01:17:36,930
♪ You made my
hands to worship ♪

1418
01:17:36,931 --> 01:17:37,931
Hey!

1419
01:17:38,689 --> 01:17:40,205
Sorry. I'm late.

1420
01:17:40,206 --> 01:17:41,723
I don't know why they
tell you to order online.

1421
01:17:41,724 --> 01:17:45,103
It still takes forever
for them to make the food.

1422
01:17:46,482 --> 01:17:49,310
Hey, is that all you got for me?

1423
01:17:58,206 --> 01:17:59,826
Thanks for feeding me babe.

1424
01:17:59,827 --> 01:18:01,585
Now you know I'm
always gonna make sure

1425
01:18:01,586 --> 01:18:04,067
my man has what he needs.

1426
01:18:04,068 --> 01:18:06,447
Hey, did you get the
invitation from your dad

1427
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:08,550
about the church's anniversary?

1428
01:18:08,551 --> 01:18:11,310
It looks like it's
gonna be good!

1429
01:18:12,413 --> 01:18:13,930
Camden!

1430
01:18:13,931 --> 01:18:15,205
Checking in on him
through your mom

1431
01:18:15,206 --> 01:18:17,723
is not the same
as talking to him.

1432
01:18:17,724 --> 01:18:20,654
He had a major heart
attack. You almost lost him.

1433
01:18:20,655 --> 01:18:22,757
Enough is enough. Call him.

1434
01:18:22,758 --> 01:18:25,033
- For what?
- So you can let all this go.

1435
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:26,930
Because babe,
something's missing,

1436
01:18:26,931 --> 01:18:29,619
and I think once you
talk and forgive him,

1437
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:32,205
you know, maybe you
guys can work it out.

1438
01:18:32,206 --> 01:18:33,379
Forgive him?

1439
01:18:34,241 --> 01:18:35,241
I'm good.

1440
01:18:37,724 --> 01:18:40,447
Who would have thought
after all these years

1441
01:18:40,448 --> 01:18:42,930
one of my dearest friends
would call me out here

1442
01:18:42,931 --> 01:18:45,033
to help with a studio session,

1443
01:18:45,034 --> 01:18:48,000
then turn into the
love of my life?

1444
01:18:49,103 --> 01:18:51,378
It's been four years, Cam.

1445
01:18:51,379 --> 01:18:53,861
And since I moved out
here to be with you,

1446
01:18:53,862 --> 01:18:57,378
to stand by you, yeah,
you've been good,

1447
01:18:57,379 --> 01:19:00,930
but you haven't really
been happy in a minute.

1448
01:19:00,931 --> 01:19:03,585
I am happy! Don't say that.

1449
01:19:03,586 --> 01:19:05,068
You make me happy.

1450
01:19:09,137 --> 01:19:11,102
I don't mean that kind of happy.

1451
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:13,102
You're a minister of music,

1452
01:19:13,103 --> 01:19:16,826
a sought after gospel
songwriter and producer.

1453
01:19:16,827 --> 01:19:20,102
A man of God.

1454
01:19:20,103 --> 01:19:22,930
How can you forgive
a God you can't see

1455
01:19:22,931 --> 01:19:25,379
but you can't forgive your
brother that you do see?

1456
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,102
You've been happy, but you
haven't had peace since,

1457
01:19:31,103 --> 01:19:32,241
- Amber.
- Cam.

1458
01:19:33,689 --> 01:19:37,585
I love you, but you're
wrong on this one.

1459
01:19:37,586 --> 01:19:39,240
Just like you were
wrong for not going back

1460
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:41,930
when your dad had his
heart attack months ago.

1461
01:19:41,931 --> 01:19:46,481
I mean, Dawn says he's doing
okay, but, you need to call him

1462
01:19:46,482 --> 01:19:48,309
and we need to go
to this anniversary.

1463
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:50,482
Everyone's gonna be there.

1464
01:19:51,931 --> 01:19:55,274
It'll be a good time for
all of us to make peace.

1465
01:19:55,275 --> 01:19:57,481
You need to make peace.

1466
01:19:57,482 --> 01:19:59,482
No, we're going, period.

1467
01:20:03,758 --> 01:20:04,758
A'ight.

1468
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:08,619
Okay. Under one
condition, though.

1469
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:10,102
Hmm?

1470
01:20:10,103 --> 01:20:12,343
You wear this engagement
ring when we get back home.

1471
01:20:12,344 --> 01:20:14,964
I will, but I'm
not saying anything

1472
01:20:14,965 --> 01:20:16,550
until you make this right.

1473
01:20:18,448 --> 01:20:21,274
Now tell me again, why
is it on me to fix this?

1474
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:23,931
Because, you are the good son,

1475
01:20:25,241 --> 01:20:28,241
and forgiveness is
for you, not them.

1476
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:34,964
You lucky you cute.

1477
01:20:35,932 --> 01:20:39,102
Dawn, Dawn I'll be home soon.

1478
01:20:39,103 --> 01:20:41,309
I'm out with dad.

1479
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:42,930
Why would I be lying?

1480
01:20:42,931 --> 01:20:44,412
I'm not, you know, I'm
not doing this, but you.

1481
01:20:44,413 --> 01:20:45,413
Bye, bye.

1482
01:20:46,413 --> 01:20:48,102
- Gosh!
- Keep it together, son.

1483
01:20:48,103 --> 01:20:49,068
Dad, I'm fine.

1484
01:20:49,069 --> 01:20:50,343
She's the one that's tripping.

1485
01:20:50,344 --> 01:20:51,757
All right, that's
what I'm saying.

1486
01:20:51,758 --> 01:20:53,481
Keep home together.

1487
01:20:53,482 --> 01:20:55,654
Don't let tail out
in these streets

1488
01:20:55,655 --> 01:20:57,102
make you lose everything.

1489
01:20:57,103 --> 01:20:59,516
Dad, we got a prenup,
you know that.

1490
01:20:59,517 --> 01:21:02,275
I'll never lose everything, man.

1491
01:21:03,172 --> 01:21:05,343
What's wrong, Pops?

1492
01:21:05,344 --> 01:21:06,930
You okay?

1493
01:21:06,931 --> 01:21:10,309
I'm gonna have Dolores
help you in Houston.

1494
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:11,310
What? Why?

1495
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:17,240
I haven't had her
really working for me

1496
01:21:17,241 --> 01:21:19,965
since I got out of the hospital.

1497
01:21:21,344 --> 01:21:25,757
And, your mama made one
request for our anniversary.

1498
01:21:25,758 --> 01:21:28,619
So mama's request was
to get rid of Dolores?

1499
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:29,861
Dad, how long has she known?

1500
01:21:29,862 --> 01:21:31,343
I don't know, son.

1501
01:21:31,344 --> 01:21:35,309
But Delores is not
worth me losing this.

1502
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:36,964
The Wilson name, huh?

1503
01:21:36,965 --> 01:21:42,620
No, I just love your mama.

1504
01:21:44,172 --> 01:21:46,171
I've put her through enough.

1505
01:21:46,172 --> 01:21:49,689
Life is too short to continue
hurting the people you love.

1506
01:21:54,172 --> 01:21:58,309
So, I overheard Dawn and
Amber talking the other day,

1507
01:21:58,310 --> 01:22:00,309
and, it's looking like Camden

1508
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:04,206
might be coming to the
anniversary.

1509
01:22:04,931 --> 01:22:06,895
That's good.

1510
01:22:06,896 --> 01:22:08,413
That's great news.

1511
01:22:09,586 --> 01:22:12,619
It's about time my
two boys come home.

1512
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:16,619
I have so, so much
I wanna say to him.

1513
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:18,067
Now you scaring me.

1514
01:22:18,068 --> 01:22:20,378
You scaring me, old man.

1515
01:22:21,655 --> 01:22:24,724
Anniversaries have
that effect on me.

1516
01:22:25,793 --> 01:22:29,412
Makes you appreciate
what you gained

1517
01:22:29,413 --> 01:22:31,551
and realize what you lost.

1518
01:22:32,896 --> 01:22:35,068
What have you lost, Pops?

1519
01:22:37,724 --> 01:22:38,724
Time.

1520
01:22:43,241 --> 01:22:44,862
What have you lost?

1521
01:22:48,551 --> 01:22:51,965
Camden. I miss my
brother so much, man.

1522
01:22:53,793 --> 01:22:57,448
Yeah, well you have
time to make it right.

1523
01:23:02,275 --> 01:23:05,309
A'ight, don't get all
sentimental on me.

1524
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:07,102
Only thing I'm about to
really lose is some weight

1525
01:23:07,103 --> 01:23:09,585
if I don't get some food
in my stomach, amen?

1526
01:23:11,137 --> 01:23:12,516
I need to eat.

1527
01:23:12,517 --> 01:23:16,619
I have been craving the
smothered pork chops all week!

1528
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:19,309
Man, you bad.

1529
01:23:19,310 --> 01:23:21,481
Hallelujah, right?

1530
01:23:21,482 --> 01:23:22,619
It's pouring down, huh?

1531
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:24,033
It is, man, but I
wouldn't be your son

1532
01:23:24,034 --> 01:23:25,447
if I didn't know how
to drive in this.

1533
01:23:25,448 --> 01:23:26,792
Don't worry it, I got you, man.

1534
01:23:52,655 --> 01:23:55,516
Dr. Forrest,
dial 118, please.

1535
01:23:55,517 --> 01:23:58,931
Dr. Forrest, please dial 1-1-8.

1536
01:24:04,103 --> 01:24:05,103
Mmm.

1537
01:24:08,758 --> 01:24:10,999
Have they said anything else?

1538
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
No.

1539
01:24:16,413 --> 01:24:17,413
Ma, ma!

1540
01:24:22,172 --> 01:24:23,344
What happened?

1541
01:24:24,724 --> 01:24:29,517
They were just going to dinner,
and then it was raining,

1542
01:24:30,724 --> 01:24:32,516
and the police don't
know what happened,

1543
01:24:32,517 --> 01:24:35,033
but, Blaine lost
control of the car.

1544
01:24:35,034 --> 01:24:37,585
My God, they're
both in surgery now,

1545
01:24:37,586 --> 01:24:40,585
but, I don't know
what's happening.

1546
01:24:40,586 --> 01:24:42,861
They won't tell me
what's happening.

1547
01:24:42,862 --> 01:24:45,827
Look, everything's
gonna be okay.

1548
01:24:48,379 --> 01:24:50,517
I'm sure they'll be fine.

1549
01:24:51,655 --> 01:24:52,655
Oh!

1550
01:24:53,551 --> 01:24:54,551
Oh!

1551
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:57,999
Your son Blaine is
still in surgery.

1552
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,895
His right leg was
severely damaged

1553
01:24:59,896 --> 01:25:04,758
but we're able to repair it
and we expect a full recovery.

1554
01:25:06,068 --> 01:25:07,931
Oh, thank you Jesus!

1555
01:25:09,448 --> 01:25:10,792
- Oh!
- Thank you.

1556
01:25:10,793 --> 01:25:12,067
Oh, Cam, he's still alive.

1557
01:25:12,068 --> 01:25:14,274
Oh, and my husband.
He's still in surgery?

1558
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:15,551
How's he doing?

1559
01:25:17,448 --> 01:25:19,309
Mrs. Wilson,

1560
01:25:19,310 --> 01:25:21,688
there was a lot of
internal bleeding

1561
01:25:21,689 --> 01:25:24,448
and too much damage
to his heart.

1562
01:25:25,827 --> 01:25:27,103
I'm so sorry.

1563
01:25:28,241 --> 01:25:30,482
We did everything we could.

1564
01:25:37,241 --> 01:25:39,206
No!

I missed you so much, bro.

Sorry.

1574
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,516
Happy to see you.

Man, I'm happy to see you.

Where am I, bro?

1577
01:26:39,551 --> 01:26:42,136
You're in the hospital, bro.

01:26:42,137 --> 01:26:44,551
Hospital? Well where's Dad?

Camden, where's Dad?

1582
01:26:58,655 --> 01:27:00,930
No, no, no, no, no. No, no.

1583
01:27:00,931 --> 01:27:02,274
Answer me! Where's Dad?

1584
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:04,689
Where's my...

1585
01:27:07,034 --> 01:27:08,067
Answer me, Cam.

1586
01:27:08,068 --> 01:27:10,448
Cam, where's Dad, man?
Don't play.

1587
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:25,240
What's this?

1588
01:27:25,241 --> 01:27:27,757
I found it in your
father's study.

1589
01:27:27,758 --> 01:27:31,240
He wrote it around the
time of his heart attack.

1590
01:27:31,241 --> 01:27:32,481
I was gonna give it to you later

1591
01:27:32,482 --> 01:27:34,862
but I think you need it now.

1592
01:27:39,310 --> 01:27:41,206
I'll give you a minute.

1593
01:27:48,482 --> 01:27:51,413
Son, my dear son,

1594
01:27:52,758 --> 01:27:55,999
I've made a lot of
mistakes over the years but

1595
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,792
my biggest was not making
sure you know how much I truly

1596
01:28:00,793 --> 01:28:02,793
loved and respected you.

1597
01:28:04,137 --> 01:28:07,620
Your virtue was intimidating.

1598
01:28:08,655 --> 01:28:13,550
I mean, what kid finds
a $50 bill in the mall

1599
01:28:13,551 --> 01:28:16,034
and helps the security
guard find the owner?

1600
01:28:16,827 --> 01:28:19,792
Decides to value his
temple and honor God

1601
01:28:19,793 --> 01:28:23,171
by saving himself for marriage.

1602
01:28:23,172 --> 01:28:27,136
And what man fights for his
dream and protects the gift

1603
01:28:27,137 --> 01:28:32,103
God has given him so
fearlessly, with such fervor?

1604
01:28:33,793 --> 01:28:36,310
Now, look at you.

1605
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,309
Award-winning producer
and songwriter

1606
01:28:39,310 --> 01:28:41,792
working with gospels' best,

1607
01:28:41,793 --> 01:28:45,862
writing hit after hit,
topping chart after chart.

1608
01:28:47,137 --> 01:28:49,171
I couldn't be more proud.

1609
01:28:49,172 --> 01:28:51,309
I have admired you so
much over the years

1610
01:28:51,310 --> 01:28:54,964
you always had the
heart of young David,

1611
01:28:54,965 --> 01:28:58,033
of the psalmist, with the
word and then strength

1612
01:28:58,034 --> 01:29:00,205
of God flowing through you.

1613
01:29:00,206 --> 01:29:01,723
Flowing through him,

1614
01:29:01,724 --> 01:29:04,550
ready to slay giants
with the smallest pebble,

1615
01:29:04,551 --> 01:29:07,550
I just never thought I'd
turn into one of those giants

1616
01:29:07,551 --> 01:29:09,240
to get in your way.

1617
01:29:09,241 --> 01:29:12,205
I know you never
really understood me.

1618
01:29:12,206 --> 01:29:14,136
And there were times I think

1619
01:29:14,137 --> 01:29:19,172
we didn't understand each
other, and that was my fault.

1620
01:29:19,586 --> 01:29:23,896
I hope to talk to you again,
face to face, man to man.

1621
01:29:25,034 --> 01:29:28,551
But, if I don't, I
want you to know I'm...

1622
01:29:30,068 --> 01:29:32,758
I'm sorry for how I treated you.

1623
01:29:33,931 --> 01:29:37,240
I'm sorry for what
I did to our family

1624
01:29:37,241 --> 01:29:40,033
and I am sorry I never
took the time to tell you

1625
01:29:40,034 --> 01:29:43,034
how amazing you
truly are and how...

1626
01:29:44,413 --> 01:29:47,792
How proud I've been all these
years to be your father.

1627
01:29:47,793 --> 01:29:51,930
Never let anyone silence
your gift, or your voice.

1628
01:29:53,103 --> 01:29:56,619
You are a force
this family needs.

1629
01:29:56,620 --> 01:29:59,999
A force the body
of Christ needs.

1630
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,378
Be a stronger man than me.

1631
01:30:02,379 --> 01:30:04,379
Be a better man than me.

1632
01:30:05,689 --> 01:30:08,758
Actually, you already are.

1633
01:30:10,413 --> 01:30:14,310
And I love you, son.

1634
01:30:15,206 --> 01:30:16,206
Dad.

1635
01:30:34,896 --> 01:30:39,723
When I gave you this ring,
I didn't know what it meant.

1636
01:30:39,724 --> 01:30:42,412
I was too busy
thinking about myself.

1637
01:30:42,413 --> 01:30:44,412
Well, that's what you do best.

1638
01:30:44,413 --> 01:30:46,862
No. Yeah, but...

1639
01:30:48,551 --> 01:30:53,517
Lord knows, I've
learned the hard way

1640
01:30:53,551 --> 01:30:55,379
how life grows you up.

1641
01:30:59,344 --> 01:31:03,412
I'm looking you in
your eyes telling you

1642
01:31:03,413 --> 01:31:05,586
that I'm gonna be a
good husband for you.

1643
01:31:12,758 --> 01:31:17,448
For so long, I couldn't
forgive myself for what we did.

1644
01:31:19,689 --> 01:31:23,240
And I thought that the life
I got was the life I deserve.

1645
01:31:23,241 --> 01:31:25,895
No, D, no, absolutely
you didn't deserve

1646
01:31:25,896 --> 01:31:27,412
the way I treated you.

1647
01:31:27,413 --> 01:31:29,757
You did not deserve that.

1648
01:31:29,758 --> 01:31:30,758
I'm sorry.

1649
01:31:33,344 --> 01:31:35,723
We can't change the past.

1650
01:31:35,724 --> 01:31:38,103
But maybe if we start today...

1651
01:31:42,517 --> 01:31:45,067
it can have a happy ending.

1652
01:31:45,068 --> 01:31:47,861
Baby, you're a beautiful woman,

1653
01:31:47,862 --> 01:31:51,137
a beautiful mama,
and a beautiful wife.

1654
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:54,241
And we're a family.

1655
01:31:55,275 --> 01:31:56,758
I love you, Dawn.

1656
01:31:58,103 --> 01:31:59,551
I love you too.

1657
01:32:05,827 --> 01:32:07,206
If you, um,

1658
01:32:08,689 --> 01:32:11,619
if you knew my father,

1659
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:13,550
BC Wilson,

1660
01:32:13,551 --> 01:32:18,171
you know that he'd be
impressed with this turnout

1661
01:32:18,172 --> 01:32:20,378
for a celebration of life.

1662
01:32:20,379 --> 01:32:23,310
My father counseled
so many of you.

1663
01:32:25,344 --> 01:32:28,793
Hmm. He bailed some
of y'all out of jail!

1664
01:32:29,827 --> 01:32:31,310
He paid mortgages.

1665
01:32:32,517 --> 01:32:36,481
He put groceries on
more than a few tables.

1666
01:32:36,482 --> 01:32:42,000
BC Wilson was a man
that believed in honor.

1667
01:32:42,344 --> 01:32:45,481
He was a man with a
heart for ministry

1668
01:32:45,482 --> 01:32:49,309
and a passion for
Jesus and his church.

1669
01:32:51,655 --> 01:32:54,067
You never could tell
when he was struggling

1670
01:32:54,068 --> 01:32:59,068
because he never wanted to
distract from the message.

1671
01:32:59,241 --> 01:33:00,517
I can hear him now.

1672
01:33:02,137 --> 01:33:05,757
"Y'all, shouldn't be
mourning like this for me,

1673
01:33:05,758 --> 01:33:08,103
well at least not too long."

1674
01:33:11,448 --> 01:33:14,793
Because he'd want us
to finish his work.

1675
01:33:24,068 --> 01:33:27,619
He'd hope that his
life was not in vain.

1676
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:30,585
He hoped that someone
would accept Christ

1677
01:33:30,586 --> 01:33:35,240
as their personal savior before
they leave the sanctuary.

1678
01:33:35,241 --> 01:33:39,447
He didn't know he was about
to draw his last breath

1679
01:33:39,448 --> 01:33:43,102
when he got into the car on
the way to his favorite meal.

1680
01:33:43,103 --> 01:33:47,930
But he always told me and
Blaine, "Always be ready."

1681
01:33:47,931 --> 01:33:50,033
And that's how he
lived his life,

1682
01:33:50,034 --> 01:33:52,551
ready to face every challenge.

1683
01:33:53,896 --> 01:33:57,240
I challenge you to
be ready as well.

1684
01:33:57,241 --> 01:34:00,275
Be ready, be grateful,

1685
01:34:01,482 --> 01:34:03,689
be forgiving.

1686
01:34:05,793 --> 01:34:07,758
Time is too short,

1687
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:10,826
and we can't let time slip away

1688
01:34:10,827 --> 01:34:13,654
not letting people
know that we love them,

1689
01:34:13,655 --> 01:34:15,964
and maybe, more importantly,

1690
01:34:15,965 --> 01:34:19,310
not letting people
know we forgive them.

1691
01:34:22,206 --> 01:34:26,103
Because how can we love a
heavenly father

1692
01:34:27,206 --> 01:34:28,758
who we can't see

1693
01:34:30,310 --> 01:34:34,000
if we can't love our
brother who we can see?
