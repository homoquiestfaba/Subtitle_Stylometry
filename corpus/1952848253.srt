00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:30,476
(A sort of Australian chanting or hymns)

6
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,800
Josh ?

7
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,120
- Wow!, your old man let you come up for air?
- Ohh, You're kidding, right?

8
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,040
Ohh, you're gonna be in a shit!.

00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,800

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,520
So cool, your dad brings you on these expeditions.

14
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,920
Yeah... yeah, I am just stucked.

15
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,560
How are Things at forward base?

16
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,040
They still haven't found a way through.
Everyone is tired, getting pissed off for Dad .

17
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,400
Just the usual , really...

18
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,880
As soon as I leave, the whole thing turns into
a Mongolian clusterfuck. ( gone to hell)

19
00:03:11,881 --> 00:03:12,881
(Giggles)

20
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,880
- So, Carl says you're a climber.
- I've done a little ...

21
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,280
Yes, she's strong like bull
and smart like tractor.

22
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,200
No!, original ...

23
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,360
Hey ,Eddie, I'll take lightly.
Josh, jump upfront.

24
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,880
Oh, sweet!

25
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:45,049
(A sort of Australian chanting or Hymns)

26
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,200
The last prime Eden of wilderness

27
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,360
We go down out here,
Even god won't know where we are

28
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,640
Some mud man
will be using our skulls for a soup bowl

29
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,240
- That wasn't in the brochure, honey.
- Yeah, well ... they live at large now baby.

30
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:07,724
(humming)

31
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,567
I have control.
(laughs)

32
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,680
Ahhhh, Why do we cave, Josh?

33
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,080
Well,  I do not...... momentarily.

34
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,520
No, wrong answer.

35
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,480
Why do you cave, Carl?

36
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,240
Because ...

37
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,040
Let me show you.

38
00:04:41,888 --> 00:04:45,641
(A sort of Australian chanting or Hymns)

39
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,640
Espiritu Esa-ala.
The mother of all caves .

40
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,360
- My god,  Carl .... that It's ...
- Yeah,  It's

41
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,400
Focus on the cave!
Focus on the cave!

42
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,200
Height  taken...

43
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,400
kill you in flush.....

44
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,960
XXX you gotta expend your might ... XXX

45
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,440
Low oxygen.

46
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,800
Oh, bloody Josh

47
00:05:32,814 --> 00:05:34,255
let me help you in the boil, George!

48
00:05:35,489 --> 00:05:37,819
Hey Judes , I want this free dive check, please?!
Now

49
00:05:39,153 --> 00:05:39,553
(laughs)

50
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,960
- All good, Frank?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

51
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,120
Hey J.D. you changed your bathroom, come over
here and give Judes a hand with the gear, will you?.

52
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,960
Yah ...

53
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,320
George, did we hear from Josh yet?

54
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,920
-lu(Luko ), base form me.
-Nah, no, Not yet.

55
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,720
Check it out!.

56
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,720
- Where's Liz?
- She Still decompressing.

57
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,320
- Coms(communication lines) up yet ?
- Coms are good

58
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,560
How was the dive, J.D. ?

59
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,480
- Good visibility.
- Yeah?

60
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,920
Yeah? it's a bit cold.

61
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,600
Hang out, can you give a hand with the
rebreather, my legs are stuffed...

62
00:06:11,774 --> 00:06:13,968
(George turns on music)

63
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,000
- You are getting old!
- Huh

64
00:06:18,596 --> 00:06:19,750
(song is playing in the background)

65
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,640
Off you go Virgil.

66
00:06:28,966 --> 00:06:31,771
(indistinguishable chatter between Judes and J.D)

67
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,640
Lean forward for me a bit.
That's it.

68
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,920
That's the third time
you check that gauge.

69
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,720
George ... I'm fine.

70
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,840
Been a while
since you saw daylight ?!

71
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,400
17 days.

72
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,080
Anyone can call the dive
at any time for any reason, yab?!!!

73
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,240
You all set?

74
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,640
Sure ...

75
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,640
So what else new, Luko ...?!!!

76
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,080
Carl! You're back!

77
00:07:43,218 --> 00:07:45,269
(Speaking native)

78
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:50,326
(are you smoking?!!!)
(you may kill us all..)(kaboom)

79
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,920
Why is that gear coming up?

80
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,600
Well, there a big storm building
right of the coast

81
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
Frank said to pull out
whatever gear we are not using

82
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,160
Ohhh, he did!!
did he ?!

83
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,133
Hey Jim, this cave
not gonna beat me

84
00:08:09,134 --> 00:08:10,134
(Workers singing)

85
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,080
You're in the dog ass, kid

86
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,960
Yeah, whatever ...
It's probably, dad didn't even noticed I was gone.

87
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,680
When He and Judes had to
climb to Camp 3 for those bail out tanks

88
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,360
You were suppose to bring down ...
He noticed

89
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,400
- Oh, Shit!
- Yab. suck to be you.

90
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,480
- Bail out?
- Ah.... Emergency tanks.

91
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,700
See the divers' rebreathers

92
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,560
But if something goes wrong,
we need backup.

93
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,400
What could possibly go wrong diving in caves?

94
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,880
-Look at her, she is tizzy.
- No, She goes.

95
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,480
Here. I can feel it.

96
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,560
No. Virgil scanned that whole section
There's bughole

97
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,880
Machine can not feel the cave, George.

98
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,740
Well ... Obi Wan
Taken you find a way through

99
00:08:58,775 --> 00:08:59,920
You best do it fast.

100
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,120
Two days, three at most,
This whole place will be flooded like a blood tunnel.

101
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,040
I hope this will give us plenty warning

102
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,440
You guys from the National Geographic, right?
Yeah, ... good to see you.

103
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,480
Victoria, are you gonna meet this guy?!.

104
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,160
Hey Dex, I hope you're awake bro,
you've got a visitor.

105
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,400
Hey man!

106
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,360
- Josh, man, you are in the shit.
- Yeah. Thanks ...

107
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,640
Ah this is Victoria, she is new
so give her the grand tour.

108
00:09:42,641 --> 00:09:44,211
- Hey...!
- ahhh...!

109
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,600
For you, only one dollar.

110
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,760
Esa-ala Cave .

111
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,200
The largest unexplored cave system in the world.

112
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,040
A million years of Rainwater dissolving
it's way down  through the rock

113
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,120
Trying to find its way to the sea

114
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,000
Which is of course  why we're here.

115
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,520
For no other reason than to explore
and find that hidden pathway

116
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,800
Wow ... That's incredible.
How far in they got?

117
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,120
Oh ..... A tour for the lady is it ...

118
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:17,000
(hmm)... 16 caving personnel and 50 porters
of hand carried and elite ton of equipment,

119
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,080
Almost two vertical kilometers into the earth crust
Over a period of  five weeks.

120
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,560
Wow... Now I know what Carl
has been spending his cash on.

121
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,000
Yab, kicks of billionaires.

122
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,560
That's so cool!

123
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,480
It's pretty..... basic, I... I haven't finished yet,
But you get the general idea.

124
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,160
But Dex, you've been working on this for five years.

125
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,160
Four years yeah, four ...
I mean the 3Ds is a bit of problem that all of it.

126
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,760
Well it, obviously it hasn't rendered properly yet,
and the connection speed up here is just a fractious ...

127
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,640
Ala That's not a wizard.

128
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,840
And finally, here we are,
Forward base.

129
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,560
And somewhere under there,
She goes...

130
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,240
You need to talk to Judes.
perhaps, her on the dive !.

131
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,880
- You kidding me, Now?
- I'll just telling you what I see. she's tired.

132
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,840
- rain?
- No ..no , we're good a few days yet.

133
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,560
- Let Frank on.
- yab, I'll just get him.

134
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,040
Carl !.

135
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,240
Ah...We're saved! Thank God!

136
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,920
Frank, how are you doing, buddy?

137
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,920
Nice of you to drop by, Carl.

138
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,320
(Hah ha).....You know some little bird told me
You are shutting up "Shop".

139
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,360
It would be nice of you
to ask the boss.

140
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,320
You must have found a way through, Huh?!!!

141
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,760
Wait, and You can ask me
after the dive!.

142
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,760
Yeah.... don't pull that soft to shit on me, Frank
We are running out of time here

143
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,640
Exactly, and  Some of us have been holding
equipment down here for weeks

144
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,693
While you pace out to back to America
to bring up your girlfriend.

145
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,960
You know, that's pullshit on so many levels
I not even gonna address

146
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,520
I've given you every piece of equipment
you asked for

147
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,720
Spared no expense.

148
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,960
I guess the cave doesn't understand that , Carl.

149
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,000
Frank!

150
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,600
You know what? check this out ...

151
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,880
Perfidio ...

152
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,840
And I am gonna hold this sucker down
2000 vertical meters, just to give you a shot,

153
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,360
Cause your ass is so tight, when you fart....

154
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,920
Only dogs can hear it.

155
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:23,521
(giggles and guffaws )
- Yeah!   - Yeah!

156
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:24,997
(a cheesy  grin )

157
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,680
All right ... Can you put Josh on?

158
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,000
Josh, you're up buddy.

159
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,840
Nice work ...
biting the hand that feeds us.

160
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,080
If that Softcock wants its name on this cave

161
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,240
He should be down here, getting his hands dirty

162
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,840
What?

163
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,920
You're on my shit list.
We needed those Bail out tanks down here, Josh .

164
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,200
All right, We rely on you to do your job.

165
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,760
No, a job is something you choose to do
Something you get paid for.

166
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,800
Stop treating me like
I'm five years old!

167
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,920
Then stop acting like you are
five years old!

168
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,960
Do you think this some Downhill Ride,

170
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,920
Frank ... he was due for a break.

171
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,880
Everybody is due for a break.

172
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,600
I Don't give him a special treatment

173
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,800
- You need to easy on him.
- That's exactly what I do not need to do.

174
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,080
This Cave can kill you in a heartbeat.

175
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,920
He's a good kid Frank.
Cut him some slack.

176
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,760

214
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,480
Son of a bitch ...

215
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:13,537
(a sort of Australian chanting or Hymns)

216
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,000
Carl likes to play
by his own rules.

217
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,880

00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,240
See you later ...

222
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,439
( Frank reciting from a Poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge )
(lines 1-5)

223
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,920
In Xanadu did Kubla Khan

224
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,480
A stately pleasure-dome decree :

225
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,640
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran

226
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,320
Through caverns measureless to man

227
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,520
Down to a sunless sea
(End of reciting)

228
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,535
(George reciting limerick)
There once was a man from Nantucket

229
00:17:43,073 --> 00:17:45,307
<u>who is headless to shake bucket
(End of George's limerick)</u>

230
00:17:45,342 --> 00:17:47,200
(Judes laughing)
How are you travelling George, you with us?

231
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,880
Roger that.
I'm all over you, Judes.

232
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,680
Yeah, you wish! ...

233
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,949
let's pull down to go through ...

234
00:17:54,147 --> 00:17:55,455
Just keep the coms clear

235
00:17:55,481 --> 00:17:56,481
(George laughing )

236
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,600
Yeah, well let's keep the poetry to minimum, Frank.

237
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,240
Are you good, Liz?
How long to decompress?

238
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,320
All good.
About 10 minutes.

239
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,320
I'll see you in a couple of hours.

240
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,000
Age and treachery will always
overcome youth and skill

241
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,080
I think that's $ 50 you owe me, buddy.

242
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:28,081
(laugh)

243
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,880
- settle up.
-okay dokey.

244
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,440
Let's do it.

245
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,560
Are you with me Judes?

246
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,440
I'm on your sex
through a dolphin dive.

247
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,920
I do not see anything.

248
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,160
Do not worry about it.
We are about 5 meters from the bottom.

249
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,840
Follow Josh's light.

250
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,160
You're quite a ripple rat
(You got the booster)

251
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,680
Yeah, dad gets me every summer for a month

252
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,080
Lucky you.

253
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,480
I've been dragged in all his stupid expeditions,
all my life

254
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,120
See, it Never occurred to him
to ask if I actually like caving.

255
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,160
Yab, Josh is his own man  ...
Doesn't take  after his dad much ...

256
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,920
Oh, what?! You mean I'm not

257
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,720
True, But he is also the most
Determined cave diver in the world

258
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,640
Yeah ... that's because he got nothing else.

259
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,000
- Here you are!.

260
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,520
Where about are they?

My Old man is obsessed with torture, Right?!.

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,040
All cavers are

Your Old man he is.... he is the most respected explorer
of our time.

295
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,360
He's like ... Columbus

There is nowhere else left
on the planet to explore

299
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,960
I mean, what else you can shine a light

Jesus, Frank, just leave it.

307
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,320
That hole is narrower than a nun's nasty(pussy)

308
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,880
Are you sure you're up for this, Frank?

313
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,320
That hole looks pretty tight hole, Judes.
I hope your diet, is working for you.

314
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,080

You want to go up and have a look?

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,000
You Want to spend two hours decompression?

342
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,320

343
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,640

344
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,480

354
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,880
Get me to the air bell, Frank.
Get me to the air bell!

355
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,360
This is too far. we will never make it.

356
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,080
Come on Frank, Come on Frank,

357
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,480
- Judes, is too far.

358
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,800
She is got no bailout!

359
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,680
- plumbing!  (plumbing=drowning)
- Stay calm.

360
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,960
We gotta body breath
we gotta body breath, all right?

361
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,800
Mask off.

362
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,320
Frank, do not do it.
We gonna lose you both!

363
00:27:28,704 --> 00:27:34,792
No frank , no frank, no...

364
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,059
Oh man! ...
(Zounds)

365
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,720
Fuck ...

366
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,600
- See? he just fucken yank the mask away from her.
- I do not see it that way, Josh.

367
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,640
- Josh ...!
- hey, hey Josh... you got no fucken idea ......

368
00:28:56,641 --> 00:28:57,641
- .... what are you taking about.
- No...He killed her!

369
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,440
That's pullshit.

370
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,040
She is dead because of him!

371
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,020
- Listen to me!... Listen to me!...Listen to me!
- Oh,..Fuck off!   - Listen to me!...

372
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,520
Body breathing with a full face mask

373
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,280
Is the most radical thing
you can possibly do under water.

374
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,720
He was insane to even try it.

375
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,240
It's the most heroic god dam thing
I have ever seen.

376
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,280
No, that's pullshit!

377
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,240
- Listen to me!
-Pullshit!

378
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,840
It wasn't the case of him or her josh ,

379
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,360
This was a bout dipping
one body down there or two.

380
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,400
Once the Judes lost it, it was ...
She was gone.

381
00:29:21,401 --> 00:29:22,401
She wasn't coming alive

382
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,560
- Frank had no right taking her
through there without the bailout tanks.

383
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,800
Clearly, that was her choice.

384
00:29:26,614 --> 00:29:30,631
- it's full bullshit!
- Every fiber of Judes pain was driven to explore

385
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,000
Frank didn't force her to do anything.

386
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,600
No ... No ...

387
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,760
He always pushes too hard.

388
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,680
Josh, no ...

389
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,160
He made this happen ...

390
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,320
Is it somebody want to give me a hand here?

391
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,480
Get her Wrapped up and neg. whole out of here.

392
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,840
Forward base ... Forward base, do you copy?

393
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,360
If I hear, the storm is right on the top of us.

394
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,440
Now it's live striking from the coast!

395
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,600
Damn, Frank! pickup!

396
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,840
Frank, can you hear me?

397
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,920
XXX we hear any word from Jim on a surface, yet? XXX

398
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,920
The ...the Coms are down.

399
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,600
I fortified the connector to Camp 3.

400
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,120
This is camp 4 to surface base, come in

401
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,320
What would you do? On the mountain.

402
00:30:25,321 --> 00:30:26,321
(Radio static)

403
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:30,399
Camp 4 to surface base, come in.
Jim, do you read me.

404
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,120
There is nothing can be done
for the dead on altitude.

405
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,600
If I were on the mountain
I'd keep going.

406
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,280
Ahh....Damn it!

407
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,040
Judes Knew the risks
better than anyone.

408
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,680
You drag every one along on your big dream.

409
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,320
And they listen to you, and they believe you,
and they wind up down here fucken dead.

410
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,440
God, this thing is a rock dad, nobody cares.

411
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,600
- People care.
- Oh they don't!

412
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,480
Judes cared.

413
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,840
Nobody out there, in the real world,
give two shits about this.... this fucken cave.

414
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,680
Those bail out empty
you would supposed to bring down

415
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,280
Judes and I,
had to climb back on and get them.

416
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,240
XXX Judes snapped to dive the heavily beneath with couple of hours sleep * XXX

417
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,040
XXX * didn't make any difference XXX

418
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,000
Maybe it did.

419
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,000
Wanna think about that?

420
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,960
All right the Coms. are down.

421
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,120

433

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,560
- What the hell was?
-We better keep moving.

439
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,240
Where will it leads?

440
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,400

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,840
Closely tied?
I'll take your sex, go!

513
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,160
Pull it!

514
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,520
That's it. Take one step at the time.
You got it.

515
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,480
She is climbing!

516
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,240
Nice and easy ...

517
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,040
Go baby go ...

518
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,040

keep climbing. Coming on!

520
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,560
Fight the weight!

521
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,280
- Keep coming!
- Come on!

522
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,840
Keep moving!

523
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,520
That's it, you got it!

524
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,480
Victoria! You gonna take a big hit now!

525
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,640
Ready yourself! You'll be fine.

526
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,120
Go, baby!

527
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,160
That's it! Keep going!

528
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,080
Bravo! You're doing great.

529
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,760
Stop! Stop, It moving!

530
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,760
go back down!

531
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,080
Fuck that!

532
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,027
- You all right?
- Yeah.

533
00:40:46,086 --> 00:40:47,132
Hold on, Okay.

534
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,200
Vic!

535
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,840
Josh!

536
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,280
Joshua! Where are you?

537
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,480
Ohh god! Vic!

538
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,400
You did great, Vic!
you okay?

539
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,440
No!

540
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,560
God! No!

541
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,800
Joshua! .... Luko!
Get Luko!

542
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,400
Luko!

543
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,960
Vic, talk to me!

544
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,800
- Are you good?
- I'm fine.

545
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,880
Luko?

546
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,320
George, let's go.

547
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,080
Watch this going!

548
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,480
Carl ...

549
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,040
Josh! Get him out of there!

550
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,280
Josh! let it go!

551
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,280
Leave him!

552
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,200
You did everything you could, all right?

553
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,280
Shit the exit!, Shit!

554
00:42:23,281 --> 00:42:24,281
(power went off)

555
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,480
We are heading back down to forward base.

556
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,920
You'll find another way out ...

557
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,880
... through the restriction

558
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,080
Grab anything you see that it's useful.

559
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:55,000
I said "useful."
Robes, batteries, rebreathers ...

560
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,320
We have a few hours before
this place is under water.

561
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,440
Frank, what if the air bell through the restriction is flooded?

562
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,040
Maybe you should send the ROV through
to check it out.

563
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,400
I won't be flooded.

564
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,520
Jesus George, what if he's wrong?

565
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,240
Then we sure start growing gills, Mate.

566
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,040
This is not my mask.
Where's my mask?

567
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,160
God damn it!

568
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,240
George, give me a hand!

569
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,600
What the fuck are you doing?

570
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,080
Without a suit, you'll go hypothermic.
This is the only one that will fit you.

571
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,547
Huh...Fuck that!
Can't even dive

572
00:43:42,616 --> 00:43:43,980
I cannot do this.
Any of this ......

573
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,720
You can this,
because you have to do this, all right?

574
00:43:48,222 --> 00:43:49,928
You can swim, Can't you?!

575
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,160
You can breathe,
then you can dive.

576
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,920
George will be with you all the way.

577
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,880
You'll be all right.

578
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,760
I thought George couldn't dive anymore.

579
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,800
We're taking him out of retirement.

580
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,480
XXX OK, well ... My oar are tides, Frank. XXX
There is no time to take her of her suit.

581
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,480
Not to .. show me how to use the rebreather.

582
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,680
- Listen to me!
- No, you listen to me Frank!

583
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,400
I'd rather be cold and alive than Warm and dead.

584
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,320
So, show me what to do!

585
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,440
- You'll need it.
- So I'm fine in this, Frank.

586
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:20,080
Show me what to do, because
I do not wearing a wet suit of a dead person.

587
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,880
Get her a mask.

588
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,200
The first rule of diving.
Never hold your breath.

589
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,040
You've been Bent Before bathing in Mexico, right?

590
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,880
Mexico? Fucken Malaysia.
Mexico is where I got the Chlam.

591
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,960
Dad!

592
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,400
Bring your medical kit.
It's Luko.

593
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,760
I'll get it Frank. You go.

594
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,640
He Is still alive.

595
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,400
George, we have morphine?

596
00:45:20,496 --> 00:45:21,981
No. nothing?

597
00:45:22,233 --> 00:45:23,881
How bad is it?!

598
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,720
George, take Josh a way.

599
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,760
- What you gonna do?
- There is nothing we can do.

600
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,280
What do you mean? You have to do something.

601
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,920
Josh, he's broken every bone in his body.

602
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,680
All right, He cannot Hold the rig in his mouth.

603
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,600
- You can't just leave him here to die.
- I can't and can't he too.

604
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,440
No, No ...... no ...

605
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,000
You have no..... , You have no right to do This.

606
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,440
You people have no idea, Do you?

607
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,120
You have no idea!

608
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,960
You spend your lives wrapped in comfort,
you want to play of being adventurous.

609
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,040
Well this is it.

610
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,440
Ok, Come on Vic.
Come on.

611
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,520
George ...

612
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,520
Come on mate, it's all right.

613
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,600
It's all right, my friend.

614
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:17,105
(Speaking native)

615
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,480
How does it look down there?

616
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,320
A walk in the park.

617
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,920
Closing the valve down, All right.

618
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,760
When you take it off, it stays closed, Yes?!

619
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,400
Come here you.

620
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,560
You stay on the guide line, all right.
Do not let go of it.

621
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,320
Remember how clear your mask?

622
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,200
Yeah,
Yeah, Carl instruct me through this whole again.

623
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,080
Good. Now you get to hear it twice.

624
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,120
Keep the mouthpiece no close to valve.

625
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,040
If you flood the breathing loop, it's all over.

626
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,103
We'll have over an hour of decompressing stops
before we can surface

627
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,147
Remember what you told Frank about
decompression sickness? The Bends, Right?!

628
00:47:47,182 --> 00:47:49,680
If you get Bent down there
it's going to ruin your whole day, believe me.

629
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,440
Green light is good,
Red light is bad.

630
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,618
- I'll monitor your BP R% too.
- Dad, I get. OK?!

631
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,040
All right.

632
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,960
Stay at the same depth as me

633
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,320
Or your blood is gonna fizz up like
a dropped can of bier.

634
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,040
Nice ...

635
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,680
All right, listen up!

636
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,640
Visibility is gonna be stern to shit.
N-a big deal to have visibility.

637
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,240
So stay on the guide line at all times.

638
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,480
I'll bring up the rear.

639
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,280
Victoria is the last one through that restriction.

640
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,360
What?

641
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,560
If you panic in that squeeze,
anyone behind you is dead.

642
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,040
- You'll be fine.
- Oye, See you on the other side.

643
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,280
He could've picked better choice of words.

644
00:48:35,927 --> 00:48:39,100
(hissing of rebreathers)

645
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,040
YOU CAN do it.

646
00:51:31,886 --> 00:51:33,086
Fuck?!

647
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,960
Where's Carl?

648
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,360
Where's Carl?

649
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:59,400
- We gonna raise your body temperature.
- She is hypothermic.

650
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,160
Josh, Get this face blanket.

651
00:54:01,161 --> 00:54:01,625
Yeah

652
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:02,320
Cross your arms, cross your arms!

653
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,800
Carl! Get here and get your kit off,
you gonna be under here with her.

654
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,560
Come on, get a move man!

655
00:54:10,037 --> 00:54:11,030
(Coughing)

656
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,880
- George, Get on oxygen.
-No, I'm fine.

657
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,320
Get on oxygen!

658
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,760
- It's okay, babe. I'm coming.
- Josh, where is that blanket?

659
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,680
Good, here you go!

660
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,520
I got you, I got you.

661
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,752
Her you go, Ohhh baby ...

662
00:54:34,787 --> 00:54:35,840
You gonna be ok.

663
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,640
If you get it hit, baby.

664
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,920
Come here you.

665
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,280
You are no use to me
If you fizz up again.

666
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,120
All right, If we run out of light,
we run out of time.

667
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,240
Conserve your batteries, get some rest.

668
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,960
I still can't feel my feet.

669
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:26,680
- I told I'll take care of you, babe?
- hum, Yeah fun times.

670
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,560
Dad!

671
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,440
- I should've worn her suit.
- Hey, you did great.

672
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,120
You're alive.

673
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:52,120
You understand no matter what happens,
you never ever give up.

674
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:56,560
Hey Frank, we should explore
this section while we're waiting.

675
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,400
it might be a way out.

676
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,440
- Waiting for what?
- Waiting for rescue party.

677
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:09,440
There is no rescues down here
only body recoveries.

678
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,080
Everyone out there already thinks we are dead.

679
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,840
Don't worry about it.

680
00:56:14,841 --> 00:56:16,411
(Coughing badly)

681
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,480
You all right?

682
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,160
- I'm right.
- Yeah?

683
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,360
Just taking a leak.

684
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,560
And her she goes .

685
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,480
Now I'm right.

686
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,440
I still think we should sit and wait.

687
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,560
Yeah, we could've enough food
for next Couple of days.

688
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,760
Couple of days,
This cave gonna be underwater.

689
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,040
Understand?

690
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,240
We follow the river and get to the ocean.

691
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,240
OK, this way!

692
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,040
- Are you sure?
- No.

693
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,560
Come on!

694
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,400
George, you all right?

695
00:58:08,092 --> 00:58:10,267
(Coughing strongly)

696
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,720
I'm fine!

697
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,880
You go on up ahead!

698
00:58:27,207 --> 00:58:30,689
(Breathing hard)

699
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,280
George!

700
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,240
Are you alright?

701
00:58:52,001 --> 00:58:52,807
Aye!.

702
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,560
Did I ever told you about the time
your dad really fucked up ?!

703
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,320
No.

704
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,840
We were Checking out these caves on Malabo we found.

705
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,680
And There was nothing out there,
as far as the eye can see,

706
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,960
is this bloody great big hole,
in the out of nowhere.

707
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:19,000
So, Frank parks the truck up to the edge of it.
so we can tie off the guide line.

708
00:59:19,612 --> 00:59:21,018
-Right!
-Right.

709
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:25,440
We did the dive, we swimming back out ...

710
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,760
... and suddenly
there is a vehicle blocking the entrance.

711
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,640
60 feet under water!

712
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:37,200
I'm thinking: "Shit!
that license plate looks familiar. "

713
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:45,240
Gone and left the hand break off.
Dam son of bitch

714
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,880
The bull(truck) is dragged back into the cave with us.

715
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:53,240
We had to smash open the back window
just so we can swim out

716
00:59:53,241 --> 00:59:54,241
Huh...!

717
00:59:54,080 --> 01:00:00,160
Then, the boor bastard had
to walk 30 mile a head...

718
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,440
... 20 mile just to go get some help.

719
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:07,684
(Coughing  continuously)

720
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:16,320
humf..! .He's a hell of a fellow
your old man, once you get to know him.

721
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:22,280
Hold thing for me a little while.

722
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,680
I just need to catch my breath.

723
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,360
Go on ...

724
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:33,760
Go.

725
01:00:44,191 --> 01:00:49,641
(Coughing up foamy blood)

726
01:00:53,094 --> 01:00:59,442
Fuck!
yab yab.

727
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,520
How are you holding up?

728
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,160
Hot bath and a brandy
and I'll be fine.

729
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:19,320
- Carl! We'll take a break once we hit the top, all right?
- Sounds good!

730
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,480
Where's George?

731
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:27,240
He's aah. .. he's back there somewhere taking
a break. He said he'd catch up with us.

732
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,480
George!

733
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,520
George!

734
01:01:35,861 --> 01:01:36,352
George!(angrily)

735
01:01:36,387 --> 01:01:38,280
- Dad, what is going on?
- Where did you see him last?

736
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,200
- wa, I do not know ...
- Where?

737
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,640
he's got The Bends. he doesn't want to
slow us down slow us down.

738
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,080
Dad, his rig is right up!...

739
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:53,160
George, I know what are you doing!
George, where are you?

740
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,480
George!

741
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,600
Oh Jesus!

742
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,280
Dad!

743
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:02,640
Oh God!

744
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,760
<i>GEORGE WAS HERE</i>

745
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,480
George, where are you?
Damn it!

746
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:12,440
George! You don't have to do this!

747
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,280
George!

748
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,000
George, where are you?

749
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,840
Turn that light off .

750
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,840
Come on, Josh. We will make the cover
of National Geographic, yeah!

751
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,280
Hey, .... hey....
What the fuck are you doing?

752
01:02:50,364 --> 01:02:51,530
Dad

753
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,360
When they pull our bodies out of this place,
There is not gonna be any tourist shot.

754
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,640
Not of me and not of my boy!

755
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:58,960
Understood?

756
01:02:59,080 --> 01:02:59,765
Get off, Frank!

757
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:01,447
God.., oah!

758
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,880
- You okay, baby?
- Jesus Christ!

759
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,920
You're actually enjoying this, aren't you Frank?
Hmmmmf?!

760
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,400
Making life or death decisions,
playing the God ...

761
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,320
There is no God down here.

762
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,400
This place does not give a rat's ass about
you or me.

763
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,200
Or any of us.

764
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,720
We are a bits of dust
passing through ...

765
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,240
Carl ...

766
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:39,200
- George has gone.
- Oh, what do you mean gone?

767
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:43,280
He fizzed up.
Decompression sickness.

768
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,360
He's gone ...

769
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,480
Oh, Jesus .
I'm sorry, Frank.

770
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:03,360
I'm sorry. oh Shit!

771
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:27,520
Come on, keep up! Josh, Victoria!

772
01:04:27,521 --> 01:04:34,436
(Running water and splashes sounds)

773
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:25,280
- That's a meat grinder down there.
- Shit!

774
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:30,800
Maybe we missed something.
One of those tunnels back there...

775
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:35,000
No. we follow the river, all the way to the ocean.

776
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,680
Maybe we should head back,
wait for the water to subside water

777
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,000
So we can find another way out.

778
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,960
Carl, you can do whatever you like.
Josh and I going down here .

779
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,480
Can't we least take a vote on it?

780
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:53,120
All right, let's vote on it.
two against two. now What do we do?

781
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,640
Come on, enough of this pull shit!

782
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,800
Let's go back,
check on those tunnels.

783
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,400
No! Wait!

784
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,760
- It's best to stick together.
- Okay.

785
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,560
You better be right, Frank.

786
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:14,560
there's a niche below us, if I can get a cam in there.

787
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:19,320
I am gonna need an anchor,
So I could reverse around the other side.

788
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,480
Frank, I can hardly feel my fingers.

789
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,520
Dad, it looks pretty tricky,
you should let me do it.

790
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:27,160
No. Absolutely not.

791
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,920
Let him do it, Frank.

792
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,560
Your son is the best climber we have.

793
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:40,600
Aye.

794
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,280
you be careful. Please.

795
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,880
I have control.

796
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,760
- Have you clipped it ?
- Roger that!

797
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,760
All right, give me some slack.

798
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,640
I'm gonna have to improvise this last phase.

799
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,160
Yes!

800
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:51,440
Are you good?

801
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:58,400
- I'm good!
- Good. good boy!

802
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,600
Are you okay?

803
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,080
get that light off her!

804
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:55,800
Jesus Christ!

805
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,520
Hang on, honey!

806
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:00,560
- Victoria! Try not to move!
- What going on?

807
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,000
Her hair caught in a rack!

808
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,360
Jesus Christ!

809
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,720
Hang on there, honey!

810
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:09,600
Hang on!

811
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,960
Joshua, go back!
Get off that line!

812
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:14,640
It won't back your weight!

813
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,360
Help me!

814
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,440
- Hang on there Vic! We're coming!
- Victoria, listen to me!

815
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,560
I'm gonna transfer your weight.
try to get a foot hold.

816
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:23,800
I can't get a hold!

817
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,000
Oh Christ!
You have to do something!

818
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,400
- all right, I'm Coming up!
- You're not!

819
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,320
You're Staying here
until we work out a plan.

820
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,160
Victoria, Do not panic!

821
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,960
Hang on, Victoria!

822
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:39,600
Victoria, Listen to me!
I know you in a lot of pain!

823
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,640
- But you have to stay there!
- Help me!

824
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,920
Do nothing until we can get
around after you, You understand?

825
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,920
I'm gonna cut my hair free!

826
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,560
No! Do not use a knife!

827
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,080
Put the knife away?

828
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,800
Take that knife away from the rope!

829
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,160
I can get up to her!

830
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,440
Christ!

831
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,800
- Put your knife away, Victoria!
- I can climb up there and I can get her!

832
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,760
You understand me!

833
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:03,400
I can get up to her!

834
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,680
Victoria!

835
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:18,120
Christ!
Jesus Christ!

836
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,440
Nahhhhhhhhh!

837
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,680
We should keep going.

838
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,200
Josh ...

839
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,960
Victoria made her own choices.

840
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,600
All right!, she chose to come down here
Without experience,

841
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,520
Chose to dive without a wet suit

842
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,560
She chose to use her knife.

843
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,240
That's three big mistakes.

844
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,600
In a place alike ,you're lucky
get away with one.

845
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,840
Now we've only got one rebreather left.

846
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,200
You heartless bastard.

847
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:19,880
Have you no decency?

848
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:24,920
Who the hell do you think you are?

849
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,840
We can mourn her in the daylight.

850
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,040
We gotta get on.

851
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:39,360
- Since when did you become like this?
- Look ...

852
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,400
Josh ...

853
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:51,410
I know I have not been any thing
of a father to you. All right....

854
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:56,680
I'm not up there for a stop mate.
that is the fact.

855
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:02,040
CDs, cars, and mortgages ...

856
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:04,400
I could never be
what your mother needed  ...

857
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,480
... or probably what you needed.

858
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:09,640
Why ...?!!!

859
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,600
...  Why caves?

860
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,720
Down here, I can make sense of this.

861
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:17,960
XXX  Can you * mean *...XXX

862
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,000
It's like my church.

863
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,920
I can hold a mirror up
and say :"This is who I am".

864
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,040
I do not want to die, Dad.

865
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,200
I do not want to die down here.

866
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:45,920
It's alright ...

867
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:52,520
It's alright, mate!

868
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,480
You're not gonna die.

869
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,680
I'm sorry.

870
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:08,400
- I'm gonna get you out of here, all right?
- Yab.

871
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:11,840
Good.

872
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,440
Let's keep moving.

873
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,800
Jesus Christ! Not that again.

874
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:10,200
All right, We rest up here for awhile.

875
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:14,960
Then I'll take the last rebreather
run through, see if she goes.

876
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,320
Then I'll come back to get you, Josh.

877
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:23,800
- And later you, Carl, yab?
- Sure, Frank. Whatever what say.

878
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:31,080
Dad! Carl is taking the rebreather !

879
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,200
What is he doing?

880
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:38,880
He's not gonna come back.

881
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:40,320
You son of a bitch!

882
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:23,680
Fuck!

883
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,320
Come on!

884
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,520
Dad!

885
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,440
- Is it dead?
- Yab.

886
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:23,840
Well The tunnel could choke
Then he'd have to come back.

887
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:26,680
If the tunnel chokes,
we're dead anyway.

888
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,480
So what do we do now?

889
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,840
I do not know ...

890
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:38,360
I'm tired. I need to rest.

891
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:43,280
What are you talking about? We have to go back.
You'll find another way out.

892
01:17:46,491 --> 01:17:47,330
(chuckling)

893
01:17:47,365 --> 01:17:48,120
What's wrong with you?

894
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,240
You remind me of me.

895
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,520
Shit!

896
01:17:58,933 --> 01:18:01,954
(sniffing)

897
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:21,560
Bat Shit!

898
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:24,920
You think there's a way out?

899
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:28,920
I'm guessing the bats didn't swim down here.

900
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:47,840
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan"
"A stately pleasure-dome decree  "

901
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,240
What's that?

902
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,320
Coleridge(Samuel Taylor Coleridge).

903
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,760
XXX Very bisskipy. XXX

904
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:01,920
Well He was on drugs when he write it.

905
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:06,560
I did not you're into poetry.

906
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,560
I'm not .

907
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,600
Your mother was.

908
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,160
Teach it for me.

909
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,000
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan"

910
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,440
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan"

911
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,760
"A stately pleasure-dome decree  "

912
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,480
"A stately pleasure-dome decree  "

913
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:47,800
- "Where Alph, the sacred river, ran "
- "Where Alph, the sacred river, ran "

914
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:54,120
- "Through caverns measureless to man"
- "Through caverns measureless to man"

915
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,960
Get up there.
Climb up to me.

916
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,760
Give me your hand!

917
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:54,960
- Fuck!
- Bravo!

918
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:03,440
Oh. I have turned off the light.

919
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,320
Christ! ...

920
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:43,603
Ah Shit! Okay...

921
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:44,486
(watch beep)

922
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:06,200
You should rest up.

923
01:22:12,666 --> 01:22:13,437
(watch beep)

924
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,280
Dad, I can see you .

925
01:22:29,375 --> 01:22:30,454
(bat screeching)

926
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,400
Well, we're not climbing out of here.

927
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:16,960
- Well, that's something you don't see every day.
- A tank?

928
01:23:18,338 --> 01:23:19,834
A bloody tank?!

929
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:23,960
Japanese. They were all over this place during the war.

930
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,600
Amphibious.

931
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,040
We must be pretty near the coast.

932
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,520
The cave must have collapsed underneath them.

933
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:41,800
- You think anyone survived?
- Doesn't look like it.

934
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,200
Well there you go.

935
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:11,680
I told you!

936
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:22,760
We could stay here, you know.
hope that someone finds us.

937
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:25,120
Assuming they are looking for us.

938
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,440
Assumptions is the mother of all fuckups.

939
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,600
That's sounds familiar.

940
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:36,240
Man we are so close  ...
Now she is teasing us.

941
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:42,800
Oh, don't take it personally.
We are here now and that the main thing.

942
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:51,120
So What would we do? do we Stay here
or do we push on?

943
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:53,920
You decide.

944
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:17,800
<i>FRANK AND JOSH WERE HERE.
SEE Ya!</i>

945
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:36,080
Hey Dad, I found the river!

946
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:45,400
Lost my grip.

947
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,160
Well, You should be more careful.

948
01:25:49,296 --> 01:25:50,095
(laughing)

949
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:11,440
Carl ...

950
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,120
Nah.......... empty.

951
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:25,560
Dead.

952
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,080
The river has flushed
everything here like a sewer.

953
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:35,040
Yeah ... it stinks in here.

954
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:41,720
Josh? Frank? is that you guys?

955
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:48,240
Oh, oh Thank God!

956
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:54,280
Carl ...

957
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,640
What the fuck?

958
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:59,280
Where the hell were you thinking?

959
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:05,080
Well, I was gonna come back for you guys.
I would have come back.

960
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,560
I would've, you know!
I just ran out of air.

961
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:15,320
- Please! Do you got any food?
- Yeah, of course.

962
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,158
Oh.. Thank you!
Thank you!

963
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:30,800
Frank! Please do not go over there, Frank!.

964
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:36,720
Frank! Please, don't!

965
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,760
The river dumped her here, Josh.

966
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,080
Like a piece of garbage.

967
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:55,600
Oh, Josh I'm sorry, buddy!
I missed up, you know!

968
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,640
I admit it, I missed up, okay!

969
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,160
I panicked.
It was a moment of madness.

970
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,560
I do not know what to do.

971
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,080
I'm sorry!

972
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,680
Good got a Chances ...

973
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:14,080
Josh, let's go.

974
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:17,200
Wait! What?

975
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:18,720
Josh?

976
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:20,680
Josh?

977
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,060
- No! No! No! you're not gonna leave me here!
No Wait!

978
01:28:23,371 --> 01:28:24,977
- You can do whatever you like.

979
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,520
Frank!

980
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,720
Well fuck you, Frank!

981
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:36,920
She goes.

982
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,760
- There is a tight squeeze...
- yahh ...

983
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:40,360
But once you get through it, it's crystal clear.

984
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,160
Well we'll body breathe through the sub.

985
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:46,480
- One breath each, not shallow breath.
- What about Carl?

986
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:48,760
I'll go get him.

987
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,960
I can't breathe ...

988
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:15,760
It's...It's my back ...

989
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:28,400
Put me down, Josh.

990
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:38,040
Josh, you.... you Trust the cave, all right?
Trust the cave!

991
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:40,840
Follow the river. I'll lead you out.

992
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:44,760
What?! no no?!
No. We can still make it.

993
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:48,920
And we can body breathe, like you said.
It'll be fine.

994
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:58,680
He killed Victoria, Josh!

995
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,080
Luko ... he'll kill all of us!

996
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:05,920
you take one step closer, and I'll fucken kill you!

997
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:10,560
The only reason we're still breathing is because of him.

998
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:53,558
Josh, could you.....
could you get me into the water?

999
01:31:53,689 --> 01:31:56,633
Could you help me into the water?

1000
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:06,000
Oh Good , Oh good ...

1001
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:11,800
You've got better instincts
than me.

1002
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:14,680
So Listen to them, all right ?

1003
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:19,760
You keep going.

1004
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:23,480
Do not you give up, or you will be back
on my shit list.

1005
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:26,400
No. Dad, I'm not leaving you here.

1006
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:33,320
Can you....Can you help me?

1007
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:37,440
Help me.
I don't want this to take too long.

1008
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:41,360
No!No!No!
No!

1009
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:48,240
That's all right ...

1010
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,880
I'll stay .... I'll stay with you ...
I will stay......

1011
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,000
You'll be fine.

1012
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:59,267
hey no, You stay and you'll die.

1013
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,720
No.

1014
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,560
Just help me.

1015
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:08,680
I'm so proud of you, Josh.

1016
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,200
Please help me.

1017

Josh!

1024
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:13,880
It's time to go.

1025
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:16,240
Are we home yet?

1026
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:19,640
Nearly.

1027
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:07,800
George was right.

1028
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:12,720
I never knew my father,
but I've found him in that cave.

1029
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:18,000
He was a hell of a fellow,
once you get to know him .
