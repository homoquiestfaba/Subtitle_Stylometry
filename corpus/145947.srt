You should be leaving any minute.

6
00:00:43,952 --> 00:00:46,477
-My lamp doesn't work.
-What?

7
00:00:46,688 --> 00:00:50,920
The lamp, the goddamn lamp next
to my bed. You know what a lamp is?

8
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,116
-Dad, did you try the switch?
-What?

9
00:00:53,328 --> 00:00:55,853
On the bottom of the thing.
Maybe it's on the cord.

10
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:00,057
Like that twirly thing on the cord.
Push that with your thumb.

11
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,702
l got it! l got it, baby.

12
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:08,770
Hello. Who is this?

13
00:01:08,977 --> 00:01:10,774
Dad, it's Eve. You called me.

14
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,947
Are youjealous ofyoursister?.

15
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:14,978
Dad, l'm driving downtown.

16
00:01:15,216 --> 00:01:17,480
This is not a question
for downtown traffic.

17
00:01:17,685 --> 00:01:20,483
Come on! Georgia could run
the lsraeli Army.

18
00:01:20,688 --> 00:01:22,883
Maddy couldn't even
get into the Army.

19
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,482
You're right, Dad.

20
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:31,097
You're completely right, Dad.
Georgia could run the lsraeli army.

21
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:32,596
Hi, Dad.

22
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,258
-Evie, guess who calledjust now.
-Who?

23
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,838
John Waynejust called me.
Tell Georgia. Tell Maddy.

24
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:43,533
-John Waynejust called you.
-Hejust called me on the telephone.

25
00:01:43,745 --> 00:01:45,144
John Wayne is dead.

26
00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:47,746
They think he's dead.
They're not sure.

27
00:01:47,949 --> 00:01:51,112
He's dead, and that's why
you're going to the hospital.

28
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,581
You're disoriented.

29
00:01:52,787 --> 00:01:55,551
l spoke to him on the telephone.

30
00:01:55,757 --> 00:01:58,089
So he's a Republican. So what?

31
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,017
l'll see you in 10 minutes.

32
00:02:01,396 --> 00:02:03,057
No Surprises. Kim speaking.

33
00:02:03,264 --> 00:02:05,596
Kim? Listen, l'm not
gonna be in today.

34
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,767
My father....

35
00:02:06,968 --> 00:02:10,369
-What happened this time?
-l don't know, but l'm worried.

36
00:02:10,571 --> 00:02:14,530
l'm meeting him at the hospital.
Are there any messages?

37
00:02:14,742 --> 00:02:19,076
Madge Turner, she wants you to move
the party to the Nixon Library.

38
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,043
What? No!

39
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,950
No, Kim. That is insane.
The party is in two weeks.

40
00:02:26,154 --> 00:02:29,055
We cannot change the location.
You tell her to forget it.

41
00:02:29,257 --> 00:02:31,487
Me? Wait, l have to tell her?.

42
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,251
No, no, l'll do it.

43
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:35,895
Remind me to call the caterer.
500 women are coming...

44
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,155
...and l bet half
are lactose intolerant.

45
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:41,329
l hope my dad's okay.
l better call Georgia.

46
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,061
All right, Kim? l'll call you back.

47
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,407
Georgia Magazine.

48
00:02:46,607 --> 00:02:48,700
May l speak with Georgia, please?
lt's Eve.

49
00:02:49,143 --> 00:02:51,668
ls she available to do it?
l feel like she's--

50
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,540
Georgia, l have your sister.

51
00:02:53,748 --> 00:02:55,375
No. Not now.

52
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,983
You know what? She's behind
closed doors right now.

53
00:02:59,187 --> 00:03:01,917
-Libby, dear. Hurry, honey!
-l'm coming!

54
00:03:02,123 --> 00:03:03,886
l need my bag.
Thank you so much.

55
00:03:07,161 --> 00:03:10,722
-Eve?
-Maddy, thank God you called.

56
00:03:10,932 --> 00:03:11,899
Guess what?

57
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,463
l don't wanna hear about Dad again.
l'm sorry. l'm too happy.

58
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:19,333
Eve, it is so beautiful here.

59
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,202
lt's spiritual. You know?
lt's God's country.

60
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:23,840
Here we go.

61
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:25,273
No, no, no!

62
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:27,071
l'm sorry!

63
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:29,909
Oh, my God.
She'll think l hung up on her.

64
00:03:30,384 --> 00:03:34,411
Maddy, can you hear me? Maddy?
Hello? Hello? Maddy?

65
00:03:41,462 --> 00:03:43,362
No Surprises. Kim speaking.

66
00:03:43,564 --> 00:03:47,022
lt's me again. Are you sure?
Are you positive about this?

67
00:03:47,235 --> 00:03:49,135
lt's just bad news.

68
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:53,296
Yes, she wants to move it
to the Nixon Library.

69
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:58,208
They have parties there?
Where is that? Wait, where am l?

70
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:00,937
-l don't know. l have no idea.
-l'm here.

71
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:04,915
l can't deal with this right now.
l'll call you back later.

72
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,519
Well, there she is. Hello, dear!

73
00:04:10,725 --> 00:04:13,216
Oh, my God. Dad!

74
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:19,057
Who's there?

75
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:21,428
Lou Mozell from
the Motion Picture Home.

76
00:04:28,376 --> 00:04:29,468
Got it?

77
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:35,210
Angie, did l ever tell you about
the time l got a gun from John Wayne?

78
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:40,080
Pat and l wrote a picture for him
called Luck Runs Out.

79
00:04:40,555 --> 00:04:42,284
Yeah, he was a very nice guy.

80
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,685
They say that he had
a very small pecker...

81
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:48,555
...but that didn't keep him
from being a real he-man.

82
00:04:48,763 --> 00:04:51,755
l mean, that had absolutely
nothing to do with it.

83
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:54,935
-Why are we going in here?
-Because it's the room.

84
00:04:55,136 --> 00:04:58,128
-ls there room service in here?
-No.

85
00:04:58,606 --> 00:05:00,801
They leave a key for the minibar?

86
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:02,703
There is no minibar.

87
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,574
Place of birth, Mr. Mozell?

88
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:09,140
The Bronx, New York City.

89
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,544
Education?

90
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:11,877
Harvard.

91
00:05:12,153 --> 00:05:13,620
Graduated with full honors.

92
00:05:13,821 --> 00:05:15,015
Oh, Dad!

93
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:16,655
Summa cum laude.

94
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,086
Age?

95
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:19,691
Thirty-eight.

96
00:05:19,894 --> 00:05:21,156
Seventy-nine.

97
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,489
-And your wife is--?
-Dead.

98
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:27,361
No, not dead. Not dead.
Divorced. For many years.

99
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:29,192
Evie, where's that poster?

100
00:05:29,403 --> 00:05:30,563
lt's over there.

101
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:33,568
Put it over there by the dresser.

102
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,475
Please make sure
it doesn't get scratched.

103
00:05:36,677 --> 00:05:39,305
-Would you like to get into bed?
-Not with you.

104
00:05:39,647 --> 00:05:41,239
Very funny.

105
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,179
Cleo, kick her out, will you?

106
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,046
l'm not Cleo. l'm Dr. Kelly.

107
00:05:46,254 --> 00:05:47,653
Dr. Kelly, yeah?

108
00:05:47,855 --> 00:05:51,154
Of the lrish Republican Army, are you?

109
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:54,419
Well, l love them sassy, doc.
How old are you?

110
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,763
What day of the week
is it, Mr. Mozell?

111
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:00,430
Fruppsday.

112
00:06:00,635 --> 00:06:01,897
What month?

113
00:06:02,103 --> 00:06:03,001
What month?

114
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:04,432
Kugie-wugie!

115
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,803
You gotta stop that!

116
00:06:12,346 --> 00:06:14,610
The Duke said, ''Your mother and dad...

117
00:06:14,815 --> 00:06:17,375
...make a hell of a writing team.''

118
00:06:17,618 --> 00:06:18,744
Remember, Evie?

119
00:06:18,953 --> 00:06:20,477
That's what the Duke said.

120
00:06:20,688 --> 00:06:23,452
He said it to Evie
when she was 5 years old.

121
00:06:24,058 --> 00:06:27,050
She shook hands with him,
said, ''Howdy, partner!''

122
00:06:27,295 --> 00:06:28,284
He laughed.

123
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:30,589
He was a real sweetheart.

124
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,127
They say his pecker
was no bigger than--

125
00:06:33,334 --> 00:06:34,323
Dad!

126
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,439
Probably why he liked guns, you know?

127
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,831
Small pecker, big guns.

128
00:06:42,376 --> 00:06:44,776
You get that?
What l'm trying to bring out?

129
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:46,139
You don't have to....

130
00:06:46,347 --> 00:06:49,339
Where's the gun he gave me?
Evie, where's the gun?

131
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,517
He didn't give you a gun, remember?

132
00:06:51,752 --> 00:06:55,210
He gave you the bullet.
lt's right here.

133
00:06:55,423 --> 00:06:58,290
You're not gonna go away
and leave me here, are you?

134
00:06:58,826 --> 00:07:00,316
Just for a little bit, Dad.

135
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:01,586
At least a week.

136
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,161
A week?

137
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:04,889
l promise you--

138
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:07,795
l just die when you're not here.

139
00:07:08,002 --> 00:07:11,494
You're having memory problems.
They have to run some tests.

140
00:07:11,772 --> 00:07:14,263
Everybody has memory problems.

141
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,306
You could remember for me.

142
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:18,876
Please don't leave me here.

143
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,616
Can you write a sentence
for us, Mr. Mozell?

144
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,809
Leave me alone. Can't you see l'm
in conference with my daughter?

145
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:28,989
Here's the pen, Mr. Mozell.

146
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:35,387
A sentence!
What kind of sentence do you want?

147
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,826
Here, shove it up your schmeer!

148
00:07:40,134 --> 00:07:41,795
Don't go, Evie.

149
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,630
l'm begging you.

150
00:07:44,138 --> 00:07:45,969
Don't go, Evie.

151
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,366
Are you there?
Are you both listening?

152
00:07:50,611 --> 00:07:52,203
He wrote, ''lt's too late.''

153
00:07:52,613 --> 00:07:54,808
She asked him,
and that's what he wrote.

154
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,213
ls this eerie or what?
''lt's too late.'' My God!

155
00:07:59,153 --> 00:08:00,381
What does it mean?

156
00:08:00,588 --> 00:08:02,818
Too late for tests, forhelp.

157
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,584
This is serious. He's disoriented.

158
00:08:05,793 --> 00:08:09,058
He's in a wheelchair.
He's telling us it's over.

159
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:13,799
They should adjust his medications.
Did you talk to the doctor?

160
00:08:14,268 --> 00:08:17,203
The doctor was
approximately 1 1 years old.

161
00:08:17,405 --> 00:08:20,602
Obviously, it wasn't the real doctor.
lt was a resident.

162
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:23,436
Call back and ask
to speak to the real doctor.

163
00:08:23,644 --> 00:08:25,612
l said l wanted Maureen Oriff.

164
00:08:25,846 --> 00:08:27,973
He mentioned
John Wayne's pecker again.

165
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,581
You gotta be kidding! Did he really?
That is hilarious!

166
00:08:34,422 --> 00:08:36,287
He is obsessed with that pecker.

167
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,092
l wasn't talking to you. Sorry.

168
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:43,089
You weren't here.

169
00:08:43,297 --> 00:08:45,424
l am sorry l couldn't be there.

170
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:47,100
Oh, Maddy.

171
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:50,132
-This is my only vacation!
-l didn't mean it that way.

172
00:08:50,371 --> 00:08:53,465
We work 1 0 hours a day,
five days a week, 52 weeks a year.

173
00:08:53,674 --> 00:08:56,507
-Yeah, l know.
-Aside from the dialogue...

174
00:08:56,777 --> 00:09:00,076
...soaps are the closest thing
to theater on television.

175
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,541
The only reason that
l can go away now...

176
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,150
...is because Juliana is
in the Bahamas...

177
00:09:05,352 --> 00:09:07,320
...because her boss
is having an affair.

178
00:09:08,222 --> 00:09:09,587
Who's Juliana?

179
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,360
My character, Juliana.

180
00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:16,120
Who is fully three-dimensional...

181
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:20,824
...and who right now is wrestling
with very serious identity problems.

182
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:23,799
Don't you ever watch my show?

183
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:26,537
Did she hang up?

184
00:09:27,408 --> 00:09:28,773
-Maddy?
-Take this.

185
00:09:28,976 --> 00:09:33,413
l gotta go. l'm sorry. l love you.
Call me every five minutes.

186
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:36,111
Did Maddy hang up?

187
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:39,250
-Did she hang up?
-lt's possible.

188
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:43,412
She may come back in a cowboy outfit,
talking about fly-fishing.

189
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:46,525
What do you wanna bet
she'll come back with a cowboy?

190
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:50,622
She thinks she's the only one
who works. l'm planning--

191
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:53,163
l'm so busy with
this fifth anniversary edition.

192
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:56,666
l know it's a little self-indulgent.
My fifth anniversary.

193
00:09:56,871 --> 00:10:01,103
Between you and me, l can't believe
my magazine has lasted this long.

194
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:02,172
Get this.

195
00:10:02,376 --> 00:10:03,968
l'm planning this event...

196
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:07,636
...Los Angeles Women in Commerce,
their annual party.

197
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:10,715
l landed it.
lt'll put my company on the map.

198
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:13,148
That is so sweet,
yourlittle company.

199
00:10:13,354 --> 00:10:15,788
lfyou're in business,
and you sort ofare...

200
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,754
...you should shop
at Barneys or Saks.

201
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,021
Oh, God! l'm sorry!

202
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:30,068
l'm so sor--
Are you all right?

203
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,966
Why would you do that?

204
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,167
-What are you thinking about?
-l'm so sorry!

205
00:10:40,047 --> 00:10:42,413
My lights are just falling off!

206
00:10:42,616 --> 00:10:44,345
-You see what you did?
-l can see that.

207
00:10:44,552 --> 00:10:47,350
l'm Eve Marks.
Hello. l'm so sorry.

208
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:49,318
Dr. Kunundar.
You're not driving well.

209
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,081
Thank you for not screaming.

210
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:53,692
lt's just that l was so distracted.

211
00:10:53,894 --> 00:10:56,294
l just put my father
in the hospital. l'm sorry.

212
00:10:56,497 --> 00:10:58,931
l hope it's not serious.
You can't drive like--

213
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:01,162
l have my card somewhere.

214
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:03,659
-Look at this.
-Wait a minute.

215
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,099
There you go.

216
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,737
-''No Surprises.''
-l'm a party planner.

217
00:11:07,942 --> 00:11:11,400
We do special events, and everything
goes smoothly. No surprises.

218
00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:12,973
-l see.
-l'm sorry.

219
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,513
This actually isn't
my first accident this year.

220
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,049
lf my insurance company
hears about it...

221
00:11:19,253 --> 00:11:21,744
...my rates will skyrocket.
They'll just go up.

222
00:11:21,956 --> 00:11:23,116
l got the word.

223
00:11:23,324 --> 00:11:26,054
Do you think that we could
settle this privately?

224
00:11:28,195 --> 00:11:29,526
l can't....

225
00:11:30,598 --> 00:11:33,431
l'll ask your mother.
All right, give me that, please.

226
00:11:33,634 --> 00:11:37,331
Why would you talk to my mother?
l don't even speak to my mother.

227
00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:39,938
That's very sad for you.

228
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,540
You can't go through life
without your mother.

229
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,568
You'll get a call.
Her name is Ogmed Kunundar.

230
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:49,677
Oh, your mother.

231
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:52,784
She's in Burbank, and
she'll know if this is all right.

232
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:55,615
l'm late.
My son's getting home any minute.

233
00:11:55,823 --> 00:11:58,121
And l'm so sorry. l am so sorry!

234
00:11:58,325 --> 00:12:00,384
This is fate. Or an accident.

235
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:01,788
Oh, it's an accident.

236
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:04,393
Maybe you're gonna be surprised.

237
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,827
l hope not.

238
00:12:09,737 --> 00:12:11,136
So sorry.

239
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,180
l can't rely on you.
What good is a marriage...

240
00:12:25,386 --> 00:12:27,286
...when l can't even trust that...

241
00:12:27,488 --> 00:12:30,184
...you'll be on time
for one stupid meeting!

242
00:12:34,261 --> 00:12:36,024
Look at me, Mom. Look at me!

243
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,792
Look at me, Mom, look at me!

244
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,330
Look at me, Mom.

245
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:49,839
Eve, not now!

246
00:12:50,044 --> 00:12:51,033
Forget it!

247
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:54,013
l can't take it anymore!

248
00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:56,876
What are you doing?

249
00:12:57,117 --> 00:12:59,210
Dad! Daddy!

250
00:13:05,492 --> 00:13:07,551
That's my Evie.

251
00:13:08,062 --> 00:13:10,326
That's my cookie.

252
00:13:41,595 --> 00:13:42,857
''lt's not so bad''?

253
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:46,499
-lt's really not that bad.
-Compared to a pileup, it's not bad.

254
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,691
The wheels and headlights are fine.

255
00:13:48,902 --> 00:13:52,338
lt wouldn't be an accident
without damage, l suppose.

256
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:54,564
l can just get in the other side.

257
00:13:54,775 --> 00:13:56,902
Just like that. l can just....

258
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:01,042
l don't even think we have to fix it.

259
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,441
Because look at me. l'm in.

260
00:14:03,851 --> 00:14:08,550
So there was no whiplash, and you
still have your teeth and your back....

261
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:12,817
No, l'm fine, and he just had
headlight damage and grill.

262
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,457
Mom, how many crackups
is that this year?

263
00:14:16,964 --> 00:14:18,454
That's three now.

264
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,325
What is that?

265
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:22,695
lt's my new laugh. Do you like it?

266
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:24,230
Lovely.

267
00:14:24,838 --> 00:14:25,770
Lovely!

268
00:14:25,973 --> 00:14:28,601
-Were you on the phone?
-No.

269
00:14:28,876 --> 00:14:30,605
You were on the phone.

270
00:14:34,148 --> 00:14:35,775
Let's call our legal representation.

271
00:14:35,983 --> 00:14:38,543
Do you think
they'll cancel my insurance?

272
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,346
-l don't mind getting into that side.
-lt's fine.

273
00:14:41,555 --> 00:14:43,580
That side looks as good as new.

274
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,089
l think l've been
understanding about this.

275
00:14:48,462 --> 00:14:50,828
l have to go play with my Legos.

276
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:57,160
l hope l can't go to jail for
suggesting that we settle privately.

277
00:14:57,371 --> 00:14:58,736
Did Kim messenger the...?

278
00:14:58,972 --> 00:15:01,532
Yeah. Good. The Nixon Library stuff.

279
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:06,176
That's my fourth car accident
this year.

280
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,248
Jesse, you can't leave that stuff
just hanging around like that.

281
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:13,552
You know, he reminded me of Nixon.

282
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:14,685
Who?

283
00:15:14,888 --> 00:15:17,550
My father. You know, the same jowl...

284
00:15:17,825 --> 00:15:20,658
...the same shlumpy little shoulders
like that.

285
00:15:23,263 --> 00:15:25,390
Wait a minute. Now, why am l here?

286
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:26,998
Tea?

287
00:15:30,504 --> 00:15:32,495
He can't walk, Joe.

288
00:15:34,842 --> 00:15:36,275
He's dead!

289
00:15:36,677 --> 00:15:39,202
-Hello?
-Georgia's really something, isn't she?

290
00:15:39,413 --> 00:15:42,211
-Yes, Dad, she certainly is.
-Little Georgie.

291
00:15:43,684 --> 00:15:44,912
Dad.

292
00:15:45,185 --> 00:15:47,585
So, not dead.

293
00:15:47,788 --> 00:15:51,451
Oh, not funny.
That is so not funny. God!

294
00:15:51,692 --> 00:15:53,990
You just have no compassion for him.

295
00:15:54,194 --> 00:15:55,661
You know why, don't you?

296
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:01,365
Or have you forgotten? lt happened
right here. l remember.

297
00:16:03,036 --> 00:16:04,697
He's dying, Joe.

298
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:10,535
Three guesses who that is.

299
00:16:31,465 --> 00:16:32,955
He's dead.

300
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:37,263
-Honey!
-Where is it?

301
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:41,164
Honey, what are you doing?

302
00:16:41,408 --> 00:16:42,739
Hello?

303
00:16:43,577 --> 00:16:44,942
Who is it?

304
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:48,576
-Oh, God, Maddy, is he dead?
-Dead?

305
00:16:48,782 --> 00:16:49,749
Dad.

306
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:53,282
Oh, come on, get serious.
There's nothing wrong with Dad.

307
00:16:53,487 --> 00:16:54,511
No.

308
00:16:56,256 --> 00:16:58,156
-Buck can't walk.
-What?

309
00:16:58,358 --> 00:16:59,484
Where are you?

310
00:16:59,693 --> 00:17:01,354
l'm back. What am l gonna do?

311
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,797
He's not dead.
Just take him to the hospital.

312
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:07,933
-Who?
-The boyfriend.

313
00:17:08,368 --> 00:17:09,426
How?

314
00:17:09,803 --> 00:17:11,794
ln an ambulance. My God, Maddy.

315
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:14,564
My God, he just moved his foot.

316
00:17:16,777 --> 00:17:18,540
He just moved his foot!

317
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:20,747
Oh, Buck, baby.

318
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,839
Sweetie, that's so good.

319
00:17:24,952 --> 00:17:26,817
l think l can get him to the car.

320
00:17:29,156 --> 00:17:30,180
She hung up.

321
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,152
l see that.

322
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,095
-Hello?
-This is Ogmed Kunundar, Omar's mother.

323
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,667
My son's lights are falling off.
And his radiator exploded.

324
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,360
His radiator?

325
00:17:45,572 --> 00:17:50,202
Joe, he has ice cream in his bowl over
there. What's he doing with ice cream?

326
00:17:50,644 --> 00:17:52,271
Yeah, now, are you sure?

327
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:54,037
Omar does not make a mistake.

328
00:17:54,348 --> 00:17:57,044
He is a genius. He can fix
your ovaries with a laser.

329
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,510
l'm sure that he can.

330
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,518
What l'm suggesting about
the car insurance is legal.

331
00:18:02,723 --> 00:18:04,987
Omarsays you have a problem
with your father.

332
00:18:05,192 --> 00:18:06,159
Yes, my father.

333
00:18:08,829 --> 00:18:13,027
Yes, he's been in the hospital
for a week. lt's very sad.

334
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:14,894
We're getting the results today.

335
00:18:15,102 --> 00:18:17,229
And you do not see yourmother?.

336
00:18:17,838 --> 00:18:19,931
l'm sorry, will you
excuse me a second?

337
00:18:20,173 --> 00:18:23,540
Hello? Dad, l'm on the other line.
l'll call you back.

338
00:18:23,877 --> 00:18:26,471
-There's no room service.
-You're in the hospital.

339
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,080
l want Chinese. Shrimp!

340
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:31,510
Okay, fine, fine, fine.

341
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:33,247
Hello?

342
00:18:35,856 --> 00:18:37,050
No!

343
00:18:37,524 --> 00:18:40,391
How much does she claim
the radiator will cost?

344
00:18:40,594 --> 00:18:42,255
l don't know.

345
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:47,333
l lost her. Dad called.

346
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:51,432
And now l bet she nails us
with a gigantic bill.

347
00:18:51,938 --> 00:18:53,303
And what does he want?

348
00:18:53,874 --> 00:18:56,240
Chinese food! He wants Chinese food.

349
00:18:56,443 --> 00:19:00,777
Now, how is it that a man who can
barely recognize his own pants...

350
00:19:01,048 --> 00:19:03,243
...can remember his daughter's
phone number?

351
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,975
That's one of life's great mysteries.

352
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:08,710
-You really shouldn't talk to him.
-l have to.

353
00:19:08,922 --> 00:19:09,854
Why?

354
00:19:10,657 --> 00:19:12,056
l don't know.

355
00:19:12,292 --> 00:19:15,125
Oh, Joe, don't go. Don't go.

356
00:19:15,462 --> 00:19:17,430
-l have to.
-l hate it when you go.

357
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,861
l do interviews every three weeks.

358
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:23,525
l feel like that actress in those
'50s movies; ''Don't go, don't go.''

359
00:19:23,737 --> 00:19:26,467
But the husband goes,
and the plane crashes.

360
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,369
Only she doesn't know it. She's busy
preparing that reunion supper...

361
00:19:30,577 --> 00:19:32,044
...or playing with her toddlers.

362
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:35,976
Until the phone rings.
My plane is not going to crash.

363
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:38,376
Are you listening?
Listen, listen, listen!

364
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:41,577
My plane is not going to crash.

365
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:45,249
Okay, l have to pack now.

366
00:19:47,928 --> 00:19:51,489
-What is her name?
-l don't know. Janet Leigh?

367
00:19:51,698 --> 00:19:55,634
Blond. No. A little bit bland?
God, l can't remember.

368
00:19:55,836 --> 00:20:00,330
There's gonna be a TV show called
Name That Person You Already Know.

369
00:20:00,607 --> 00:20:02,268
Teresa Wright?

370
00:20:02,776 --> 00:20:05,609
No. Not Teresa Wright. Shit!

371
00:20:05,946 --> 00:20:06,747
l must say l prefera hamburger,
whetherit's in 21 in New York City...

372
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:10,012
l must say l prefera hamburger,
whetherit's in 21 in New York City...

373
00:20:10,283 --> 00:20:12,774
...or Carl's Jr. in Orange County.

374
00:20:13,353 --> 00:20:15,947
There's nothing better...

375
00:20:16,156 --> 00:20:18,989
...than a charcoal-broiled hamburger.

376
00:20:19,526 --> 00:20:23,189
That's amazzing, Madge.
Really, it's fantastic.

377
00:20:23,463 --> 00:20:24,987
l knew you'd think so.

378
00:20:25,198 --> 00:20:26,927
You can ask him anything.

379
00:20:27,934 --> 00:20:28,901
Entertainers.

380
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:30,228
Elvis.

381
00:20:31,037 --> 00:20:34,200
People say that because
he had used drugs...

382
00:20:34,474 --> 00:20:36,942
...that therefore he could not
be a good example.

383
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:40,045
They overlook the fact that
he never used illegal drugs.

384
00:20:40,313 --> 00:20:43,214
lt was always drugs prescribed
by his physician.

385
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:47,685
-Would you like to step this way?
-Certainly.

386
00:20:48,355 --> 00:20:49,913
Come on, Kim.

387
00:20:50,257 --> 00:20:53,988
Madge, l bet Julie and Tricia
just love this.

388
00:20:54,194 --> 00:20:57,391
How could they not?
Here their daddy lives forever.

389
00:20:57,664 --> 00:21:02,567
l've been studying the floor plan, but
l wasn't quite prepared for the....

390
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:05,370
-They have parties here?
-All the time.

391
00:21:05,572 --> 00:21:07,870
-Tell her.
-Thank you.

392
00:21:08,341 --> 00:21:10,502
Our speaker canceled.

393
00:21:11,077 --> 00:21:14,706
You're a powerful group. l'm sure
we can get someone to pinch-hit.

394
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:18,373
But they'll have to be dynamic,
inspiring, brilliant and--

395
00:21:18,585 --> 00:21:20,576
We're thinking of your sister.

396
00:21:21,555 --> 00:21:22,886
My sister?

397
00:21:23,723 --> 00:21:26,157
-Excuse me.
-We want Georgia.

398
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,657
Evie, can you get me
Georgia's magazine?

399
00:21:28,862 --> 00:21:31,194
Now's not a good time, Dad.
My father.

400
00:21:31,398 --> 00:21:34,265
-ls Georgia there?
-No, Georgia's not here.

401
00:21:34,768 --> 00:21:37,066
See, everyone is fascinated by her.

402
00:21:37,304 --> 00:21:40,000
This is her father.
Of course he is fascinated by her.

403
00:21:40,207 --> 00:21:45,144
Georgia takes crap and makes gold
out ofit. She is fantastic.

404
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:47,241
Okay, Dad. l'll call you back.

405
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:54,253
Where were we? My mind is a blank.

406
00:21:54,621 --> 00:21:56,384
Georgia.

407
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,880
Thanks, Kim.

408
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,857
l'm terribly sorry,
but she is swamped.

409
00:22:02,062 --> 00:22:05,554
She's putting out the fifth anniversary
issue of her magazine.

410
00:22:05,765 --> 00:22:08,962
l think she's marvelous because
she's my sister. l love her.

411
00:22:09,236 --> 00:22:11,864
-But we don't really want her, do we?
-Absolutely.

412
00:22:12,572 --> 00:22:15,234
Okay. l'll give it a try.

413
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:16,735
You got it.

414
00:22:17,577 --> 00:22:20,205
Kim, do you wanna try
to get Georgia on the phone?

415
00:22:20,413 --> 00:22:21,243
Call her?

416
00:22:24,484 --> 00:22:27,419
Once upon a time

417
00:22:27,787 --> 00:22:32,417
l met a girl with moonbeams
ln her eyes

418
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:36,522
She put herhand in mine

419
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,228
But that was long ago

420
00:22:39,432 --> 00:22:42,367
-Hi, Dad.
-Hiya, sweetheart.

421
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:43,895
You remember this?

422
00:22:44,104 --> 00:22:46,231
This song?

423
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:48,964
Once upon a time

424
00:22:49,276 --> 00:22:52,575
l met a girl with moonbeams
ln her eyes

425
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:54,371
Yeah, kind of.

426
00:22:55,515 --> 00:22:57,779
-Look.
-What time is it?

427
00:22:58,518 --> 00:23:00,884
lt's 1 ;25. Look what l have.

428
00:23:01,621 --> 00:23:03,782
Oh, you got the Chinese! Good.

429
00:23:04,624 --> 00:23:06,148
Did you get the moo goo gai pan?

430
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:09,089
l got the moo goo gai pan,
and l got the fried shrimp.

431
00:23:09,296 --> 00:23:11,526
-The fried rice with shrimp.
-Shrimp?

432
00:23:11,731 --> 00:23:14,291
You know l can't eat shrimp.

433
00:23:14,668 --> 00:23:16,829
l didn't know that.
What do you mean?

434
00:23:17,037 --> 00:23:20,234
You remember that story
when l scrubbed in...

435
00:23:20,807 --> 00:23:25,301
...for a retrocecal appendectomy
in Honuman Hospital.

436
00:23:25,545 --> 00:23:28,981
The infected appendix, we never knew
it was in back of...

437
00:23:29,983 --> 00:23:31,177
...the cecum.

438
00:23:31,384 --> 00:23:35,047
The cecum is
a useless appendage anyway.

439
00:23:35,255 --> 00:23:37,655
l mean, it was an appendix,
but it looked...

440
00:23:37,891 --> 00:23:40,883
...sure as dickens like a shrimp.

441
00:23:41,328 --> 00:23:45,094
And three years later, l tried
to eat a shrimp cocktail.

442
00:23:45,332 --> 00:23:48,961
-What happened?
-Broke out in these half-dollar hives.

443
00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:51,967
Haven't had a shrimp since.
Too bad, because l like it.

444
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:53,469
l'm sorry.

445
00:23:53,673 --> 00:23:56,733
-l can get something else.
-l'll eat the moo goo gai pan.

446
00:23:56,943 --> 00:24:01,141
l actually knew a girl named Moo Goo
Gai Pan. That was her last name.

447
00:24:01,348 --> 00:24:02,872
Moo Goo Gai Pan?

448
00:24:03,283 --> 00:24:06,582
Her first name was Freda.
Freda Moo Goo Gai Pan.

449
00:24:06,786 --> 00:24:09,254
She was half-Jewish, half-Chinese.

450
00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:12,514
A lot of people called her
the Ori-yenta.

451
00:24:13,693 --> 00:24:15,354
What time is it?

452
00:24:16,696 --> 00:24:18,596
lt's 1 ;26.

453
00:24:21,368 --> 00:24:24,201
l never should have left your mother.

454
00:24:25,405 --> 00:24:27,737
Dad, she left you.

455
00:24:32,612 --> 00:24:34,375
Looking very attractive today.

456
00:24:34,614 --> 00:24:38,072
Why don't you sit down?
Make yourself comfortable.

457
00:24:38,284 --> 00:24:41,151
You're very attractive-looking.

458
00:24:42,222 --> 00:24:43,621
Thank you.

459
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:48,026
You're beautiful.
Very sexy, you know.

460
00:24:51,231 --> 00:24:54,632
We never got it on, but....

461
00:24:54,968 --> 00:24:56,936
l want you, Cleo.

462
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,161
l really do, Cleo.

463
00:24:59,472 --> 00:25:02,441
l would love to make love.

464
00:25:02,675 --> 00:25:06,076
Dad, l'm not Cleo.
l'm Eve, your daughter.

465
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,674
You're not my daughter!

466
00:25:09,115 --> 00:25:10,548
l don't have any daughters!

467
00:25:11,117 --> 00:25:12,243
l have sons.

468
00:25:12,986 --> 00:25:15,147
My daughters left me.

469
00:25:16,122 --> 00:25:19,148
They left me. They went to New York.

470
00:25:20,827 --> 00:25:22,419
Good riddance.

471
00:25:22,629 --> 00:25:26,326
Don't know where the affection is.
Don't know anything.

472
00:25:26,533 --> 00:25:29,001
You have a burden when you have girls.

473
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:31,362
Daughters are treacherous.

474
00:25:32,205 --> 00:25:33,968
Treacherous!

475
00:25:34,174 --> 00:25:37,041
Dad didn't even get
a Christmas tree this year.

476
00:25:37,277 --> 00:25:39,507
Maddy, he tried to kill himself.

477
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:43,148
lf Mom hadn't left him,
he never would have tried this.

478
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:46,284
l don't understand.
She left him 1 0 years ago.

479
00:25:46,486 --> 00:25:48,977
He should get over her already.
Don't you think?

480
00:25:49,189 --> 00:25:51,316
Look, this neighborhood never changes.

481
00:25:54,394 --> 00:25:55,952
Giant packages again.

482
00:25:56,362 --> 00:25:58,853
-Rudolph.
-He's disgusting.

483
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,966
-Here's your favorite.
-Please, not Scroogeville again.

484
00:26:04,204 --> 00:26:05,967
l'm sorry.

485
00:26:06,639 --> 00:26:08,197
Did you get him a present?

486
00:26:08,475 --> 00:26:10,272
Of course l got him a present.

487
00:26:10,743 --> 00:26:13,303
Remember how beautiful
this place used to be?

488
00:26:13,513 --> 00:26:15,538
l know. With Mom's gardens.

489
00:26:15,748 --> 00:26:19,013
Dad fired the gardener.
He said he was stealing.

490
00:26:22,722 --> 00:26:24,349
Oh, look!

491
00:26:24,557 --> 00:26:26,889
Oh, look at Mom's roses.

492
00:26:27,093 --> 00:26:28,219
They're dead.

493
00:26:28,428 --> 00:26:30,760
Oh, no. But the pool?

494
00:26:30,997 --> 00:26:33,522
lt had a fungus. So....

495
00:26:35,201 --> 00:26:37,226
Here, let me get this for you.

496
00:26:38,004 --> 00:26:39,301
Maddy, will you take this?

497
00:26:39,506 --> 00:26:41,872
-Does she ever call you?
-Mom? No.

498
00:26:42,075 --> 00:26:44,066
-Of course not.
-Me either.

499
00:26:44,277 --> 00:26:46,074
-Dad?
-Where is he?

500
00:26:46,346 --> 00:26:48,371
-God, it smells.
-l know.

501
00:26:49,949 --> 00:26:51,507
l'll go look in here.

502
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,255
l'll check the kitchen.

503
00:27:07,267 --> 00:27:09,861
Are you in the kitchen? Dad?

504
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,767
l'm worried. Do you think he's okay?

505
00:27:20,713 --> 00:27:22,977
-Who is it?
-lt's us, Dad!

506
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,755
Who is that woman?

507
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:33,448
lt's cool.

508
00:27:35,495 --> 00:27:36,860
lt's my girls!

509
00:27:37,063 --> 00:27:38,394
Hi, Daddy.

510
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,125
Georgie-Porgie! Evie-baby!

511
00:27:43,736 --> 00:27:45,601
-And Maddy!
-Hi, Daddy.

512
00:27:47,006 --> 00:27:49,133
-Are you okay?
-l'm fine. l'm great now!

513
00:27:49,342 --> 00:27:50,366
Come on in.

514
00:27:50,577 --> 00:27:52,545
Esther, say hello to the girls!

515
00:27:55,582 --> 00:27:57,209
You remember her, don't you?

516
00:27:59,485 --> 00:28:00,850
''Mouthwash''?

517
00:28:01,754 --> 00:28:03,085
''Rinse and spit''?

518
00:28:04,757 --> 00:28:06,281
-What does that mean?
-Esther.

519
00:28:06,492 --> 00:28:07,686
You're kidding!

520
00:28:07,927 --> 00:28:10,657
-lt's Esther.
-No way. Are you serious?

521
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:12,592
Yeah, from the dentist.

522
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:15,867
We remember you, sure.

523
00:28:16,302 --> 00:28:19,362
l bumped into your dad while visiting
my brother-in-law.

524
00:28:19,606 --> 00:28:23,042
He had to have his colon taken out.
Poor thing. My God!

525
00:28:23,276 --> 00:28:26,143
They're gonna connect
the whole thing back up again.

526
00:28:26,346 --> 00:28:30,840
So l was poking around in different
rooms looking for him, and here he was!

527
00:28:31,484 --> 00:28:32,815
He's cute!

528
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,883
Girls, let's go sit with the bullet.

529
00:28:41,561 --> 00:28:46,464
Well, now, l'm just gonna buzz off
and let you all catch up.

530
00:28:48,301 --> 00:28:50,030
And you....

531
00:28:51,304 --> 00:28:53,204
You know where to find me!

532
00:28:53,406 --> 00:28:54,566
Look at him.

533
00:28:57,744 --> 00:28:59,075
She's a great lay.

534
00:28:59,312 --> 00:29:00,643
Dad!

535
00:29:01,714 --> 00:29:06,549
l'm so sorry to hear about your mom.
l feel terrible about that.

536
00:29:06,986 --> 00:29:09,454
But if that happened to somebody
in my family...

537
00:29:09,656 --> 00:29:11,453
...l would stick to cars.

538
00:29:13,493 --> 00:29:14,960
What happened to Mom?

539
00:29:15,161 --> 00:29:17,994
l said she went down
in that crash in Denver.

540
00:29:18,498 --> 00:29:19,931
What crash in Denver?

541
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,530
l'm telling you, people always think
that they remember plane crashes...

542
00:29:24,737 --> 00:29:26,602
...even though they never took place.

543
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,134
But Mom's not dead.

544
00:29:29,342 --> 00:29:31,833
She's in Big Bear.
lt's the same thing.

545
00:29:34,614 --> 00:29:37,208
Guess you're feeling better, huh, Dad?

546
00:30:55,928 --> 00:30:57,623
l miss her, Evie.

547
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:01,827
Mom?

548
00:31:03,102 --> 00:31:05,400
l can't sleep without her.

549
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:09,039
l miss her just being there
and just....

550
00:31:10,276 --> 00:31:13,575
She's sort of....
She's the other half of me.

551
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,681
l mean, l feel like a guy
with one leg.

552
00:31:18,651 --> 00:31:21,279
Yeah, l can't sleep without her.

553
00:32:46,405 --> 00:32:47,929
Hey, Mom.

554
00:32:48,774 --> 00:32:50,264
Are you taller?

555
00:32:52,411 --> 00:32:53,537
l don't think so.

556
00:32:55,381 --> 00:32:57,246
You're prettier than l remember.

557
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:02,785
Mom, l wanted to ask you
about the roses.

558
00:33:02,989 --> 00:33:07,221
Are you supposed to cut them back to
a three-leaf configuration or a five?

559
00:33:09,328 --> 00:33:11,091
Get some cups here.

560
00:33:11,664 --> 00:33:13,291
ln the cabinet.

561
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:18,770
-ls it locked?
-No, it's open. Right there.

562
00:33:19,505 --> 00:33:21,905
Lemon? Milk with your tea?

563
00:33:22,108 --> 00:33:24,076
l don't care.

564
00:33:24,477 --> 00:33:26,240
Lemon's better for you.

565
00:33:26,913 --> 00:33:27,937
Lemon?

566
00:33:38,357 --> 00:33:43,158
The roses are all leggy and sad.
Dad's not that much of a gardener.

567
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:46,327
lt's a five-leaf configuration,
by the way.

568
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:58,943
Mom, just come home. You have to,
because everything is a mess.

569
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:02,145
Eve, dear, this is my home.

570
00:34:03,816 --> 00:34:06,182
What are you talking about?
This is nowhere.

571
00:34:06,652 --> 00:34:10,053
This is like you're living
with a bunch of squirrels.

572
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:13,690
Come home and visit, and
just come and talk to Dad.

573
00:34:13,893 --> 00:34:16,293
You know, he tried to kill himself.

574
00:34:16,996 --> 00:34:18,759
But he didn't succeed.

575
00:34:19,832 --> 00:34:22,630
No, he took an overdose
of Percodan, Mom.

576
00:34:23,703 --> 00:34:24,727
Your father.

577
00:34:27,506 --> 00:34:30,441
Well, look, l'm very worried
about Maddy.

578
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:34,405
She's dropped out.
She's living at the beach.

579
00:34:34,647 --> 00:34:38,413
She thinks she'll be a rock star,
and she can't carry a tune.

580
00:34:38,651 --> 00:34:40,642
Let me think how to put this.

581
00:34:41,687 --> 00:34:45,384
Motherhood doesn't turn out
to be a reason.

582
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,920
For what?

583
00:34:50,229 --> 00:34:54,996
What l mean is, l'm not one of those
women who needed to be a mother.

584
00:34:55,568 --> 00:34:59,971
When l was growing up, all the girls
wanted to be, so l thought l did too.

585
00:35:00,172 --> 00:35:02,003
But it didn't take.

586
00:35:06,412 --> 00:35:08,004
Just being honest.

587
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:12,072
Well....

588
00:35:16,756 --> 00:35:17,848
Thank you.

589
00:35:56,262 --> 00:35:57,388
Dad!

590
00:35:58,664 --> 00:36:01,155
You need anything?
You want something?

591
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,960
-Yeah, drive me around.
-Are you all right?

592
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:07,333
What's wrong?
Did you take some more pills?

593
00:36:07,573 --> 00:36:11,976
No, l just had a little scotch.
No pills.

594
00:36:12,244 --> 00:36:14,678
l was just kidding around
with the pills.

595
00:36:14,914 --> 00:36:15,846
Kidding around?

596
00:36:16,082 --> 00:36:17,743
l didn't mean to take them.

597
00:36:18,951 --> 00:36:20,179
Baby?

598
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,510
Drive me.

599
00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:26,683
Well-- Yeah, okay. Whatever.

600
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:28,893
Where do you wanna go?

601
00:36:32,098 --> 00:36:33,224
Home.

602
00:36:36,936 --> 00:36:38,460
Do you wanna get a tree?

603
00:36:39,605 --> 00:36:40,572
Yes!

604
00:36:40,773 --> 00:36:42,673
Do you wanna get a Christmas tree?

605
00:36:46,345 --> 00:36:47,972
Merry Christmas!

606
00:36:51,183 --> 00:36:53,617
Hey, Dad! Fake snow!

607
00:36:53,819 --> 00:36:56,982
Of course it's fake.
What do you want in L.A.? Real?

608
00:36:57,189 --> 00:37:00,852
We'll get a big one.
A big one, like always!

609
00:37:01,127 --> 00:37:05,223
Dad! How about this one?
Look at this. This is good!

610
00:37:05,464 --> 00:37:09,059
Bigger! That's a dwarf! lt's a runt!

611
00:37:09,368 --> 00:37:12,997
We'll get the King Kong of trees!

612
00:37:23,682 --> 00:37:26,082
-Look! What about this one?
-This one?

613
00:37:26,385 --> 00:37:29,980
Your mom always said,
''Don't get a big tree.''

614
00:37:30,189 --> 00:37:32,817
-Well, the hell with her!
-Yeah, to hell with her.

615
00:37:33,025 --> 00:37:35,721
Attagirl! That's my cookie!

616
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,096
To hell with her!

617
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:42,164
lt's snowing, Evie. lt's gonna
be a white Christmas.

618
00:37:44,837 --> 00:37:46,702
Look how beautiful it is!

619
00:37:46,906 --> 00:37:49,500
Oh, thank you, thank you!

620
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:52,677
Beautiful snow! Thank you!

621
00:38:01,187 --> 00:38:02,381
He's dead.

622
00:38:05,057 --> 00:38:06,217
Hello?

623
00:38:07,393 --> 00:38:09,520
Mom, the door!

624
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,657
Eve, it's Maddy. Open up!

625
00:38:18,704 --> 00:38:20,729
Oh, look at that! Oh, good!

626
00:38:20,973 --> 00:38:23,464
Hey, he loves you. That's so good!

627
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:25,677
Eve, meet Buck.

628
00:38:25,878 --> 00:38:28,870
-This is Buck?
-Yeah, isn't he awesome? l know.

629
00:38:29,114 --> 00:38:31,548
Wanna hear the saddest?
He's got Lyme disease.

630
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:35,683
Probably from all those moose in
Montana. l just got the results.

631
00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:37,920
Where are you going?

632
00:38:38,123 --> 00:38:40,023
-Wait! Where is he going?
-lt's okay.

633
00:38:40,226 --> 00:38:41,716
Hey there, doggy! Whoa!

634
00:38:41,927 --> 00:38:44,896
Look at him! He's going to eat
the couch. Get him off!

635
00:38:45,097 --> 00:38:47,531
He would never do that.
He's an angel.

636
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:49,496
He gets these paralyzed attacks.

637
00:38:49,735 --> 00:38:53,193
He has to have four pills a day,
and l'm on the set all day.

638
00:38:53,405 --> 00:38:55,839
Just forget it, Maddy.
l'm not doing that.

639
00:38:56,508 --> 00:38:57,736
He won't survive!

640
00:38:58,077 --> 00:38:59,305
That better be Georgia.

641
00:38:59,511 --> 00:39:02,810
l've been trying to reach her,
and she never calls me back!

642
00:39:05,751 --> 00:39:08,413
Georgia. Hi. Listen.

643
00:39:08,621 --> 00:39:11,454
This speech, you've got
to do it for me.

644
00:39:11,657 --> 00:39:15,650
You've got to come here and do it
on April 7th. One week.

645
00:39:16,195 --> 00:39:17,457
Well, fine.

646
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:20,831
-Fine?
-When have l everletyou down?

647
00:39:22,268 --> 00:39:23,235
Thank you.

648
00:39:24,436 --> 00:39:25,334
That's old.

649
00:39:25,638 --> 00:39:27,071
Yeah, Maddy's here.

650
00:39:27,273 --> 00:39:30,106
What? Why is she there so early?

651
00:39:30,776 --> 00:39:31,970
l see. Silence.

652
00:39:32,177 --> 00:39:34,168
Tell me later.
l can't wait.

653
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,347
How's Dad?

654
00:39:35,547 --> 00:39:38,948
l spend my life at that hospital,
and he will die asking for you.

655
00:39:39,151 --> 00:39:40,948
Excuse me. Excuse me.

656
00:39:42,054 --> 00:39:46,388
Our father is not dying. lt's
possible our father is never dying.

657
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:51,187
You need more in your life, so you
don't blow things out of proportion.

658
00:39:51,497 --> 00:39:55,365
You are such a hysteric when it comes
to Dad. You've got to get a grip.

659
00:39:55,634 --> 00:39:57,397
One more thing before l go.

660
00:39:57,636 --> 00:40:01,868
You know what? l'll send you my
banner. l'm using it for my speeches.

661
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:04,706
Your banner?

662
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,275
She has a banner!

663
00:40:07,313 --> 00:40:08,746
What does it say? ''Georgia''?

664
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,178
l'll be in L.A.--
That's enough. Thank you.

665
00:40:11,383 --> 00:40:14,375
Jonathan. l've got it now.
My hair looks really good.

666
00:40:14,586 --> 00:40:17,555
Jesus Christ, he's gotta--
Take a vacation, will you?

667
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:21,916
l've got this L.A. advertising push, so
l can knock off your little thing too.

668
00:40:22,494 --> 00:40:24,553
l was gonna wiggle out ofit.

669
00:40:24,863 --> 00:40:26,660
Don't wiggle out on me!

670
00:40:29,335 --> 00:40:31,235
When are you coming to the hospital?

671
00:40:31,837 --> 00:40:34,829
Jesse, come in here!
lt's breakfast time!

672
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,735
Or are you just too busy?

673
00:40:37,009 --> 00:40:39,307
Take it easy! My God, you're so edgy.

674
00:40:39,845 --> 00:40:42,678
l'm coming to the hospital
this week at lunch.

675
00:40:43,015 --> 00:40:46,917
l'm coming with my leg in a cast.
Juliana got hit by an Aston Martin.

676
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:49,951
Fine.

677
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,084
Buck, honey.

678
00:40:56,295 --> 00:41:00,994
Mommy has to leave you with Aunt Eve
because you have to have your pills.

679
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,565
Baby.

680
00:41:02,968 --> 00:41:07,632
Okay, she's a very nice person.
Yeah. There she is.

681
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:12,002
Georgia's doing you a favor.

682
00:41:15,481 --> 00:41:19,042
Don't cut it down.
Just put it up behind the dais.

683
00:41:19,251 --> 00:41:22,311
Yes. Just stick--
lt doesn't matter.

684
00:41:22,554 --> 00:41:24,488
You can't cut it down.

685
00:41:24,757 --> 00:41:27,453
No, l'll be there in exactly--

686
00:41:39,738 --> 00:41:41,672
Come on. Just--
All right. Come on!

687
00:41:41,907 --> 00:41:44,671
Come on, Buck, swallow this!

688
00:41:46,078 --> 00:41:49,946
Come on. Now, you want this pill.
You need it!

689
00:41:52,818 --> 00:41:57,118
Juliana. As l feared,
you have a shattered fibula.

690
00:41:57,356 --> 00:41:59,415
How can you tell he's gay? He is gay.

691
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:00,614
He's not convincing.

692
00:42:00,826 --> 00:42:03,818
Name one actor on TV playing
a heterosexual that isn't gay.

693
00:42:04,263 --> 00:42:06,128
Walter Cronkite.

694
00:42:09,268 --> 00:42:12,328
Hey, your dad's on the machine.

695
00:42:13,272 --> 00:42:14,603
Look what l built.

696
00:42:14,973 --> 00:42:17,032
ls that actress Doris Day?

697
00:42:17,276 --> 00:42:21,178
Go sit in your special chair.
Back there. Yeah, there you go.

698
00:42:21,447 --> 00:42:22,778
You're in love with him?

699
00:42:24,149 --> 00:42:28,313
How can you be in love with him?
He looks like some sort of a beetle.

700
00:42:29,955 --> 00:42:31,752
He doesn't look like a beetle!

701
00:42:31,957 --> 00:42:34,949
But why can't you just enjoy
something that l'm in?

702
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,718
l was once arrested.

703
00:42:37,863 --> 00:42:40,627
l was in isolation.

704
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:45,125
As part of the punishment,
they showed your show.

705
00:42:48,373 --> 00:42:50,204
l'll get you so good!

706
00:42:54,346 --> 00:42:55,643
Just eat one!

707
00:42:57,716 --> 00:42:58,808
God!

708
00:43:14,266 --> 00:43:18,828
Well, tell Maddy to get herass over
to the house and pick up the dog.

709
00:43:19,037 --> 00:43:20,698
What are we? A kennel?

710
00:43:20,906 --> 00:43:24,171
l swear, Joe, it's like feeding
a pill to a whale.

711
00:43:24,676 --> 00:43:27,110
Honey, this is how
this stuffhappens, okay?

712
00:43:27,346 --> 00:43:30,782
You have to stop letting people
walk all overyou.

713
00:43:31,016 --> 00:43:34,474
You are a million miles away
in some stupid town...

714
00:43:34,686 --> 00:43:37,177
...talking to people
who mean nothing to you.

715
00:43:37,389 --> 00:43:40,324
Don't call and give me orders.
You are not on my side.

716
00:43:40,526 --> 00:43:41,754
You cannot mean that.

717
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,727
l don't know what l mean, all right?
Don't tell me l do, because l don't!

718
00:43:48,133 --> 00:43:50,363
l don't want to talk right now, Joe!

719
00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:51,763
lt's Dr. Kelly.

720
00:43:54,473 --> 00:43:55,531
What is it?

721
00:43:55,874 --> 00:43:57,364
Well....

722
00:43:58,043 --> 00:43:59,840
Your father is missing.

723
00:44:00,045 --> 00:44:01,410
Missing?

724
00:44:02,548 --> 00:44:04,379
Well, that's impossible.

725
00:44:04,883 --> 00:44:09,752
He can't walk. He's in a locked ward.
l mean, he must be misplaced.

726
00:44:09,955 --> 00:44:11,013
Nevertheless....

727
00:44:11,223 --> 00:44:14,624
Did you check the other rooms?
Did you check the female patients?

728
00:44:14,826 --> 00:44:17,818
Check in the bed of every single
female patient.

729
00:44:18,063 --> 00:44:20,793
You should talk to that nurse
with the curly hair.

730
00:44:20,999 --> 00:44:24,059
Did you talk to Angie
from the Motion Picture Home?

731
00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:26,794
l'm sure we'll turn him up.
Sit tight.

732
00:44:27,005 --> 00:44:28,404
What am l supposed--?

733
00:44:57,436 --> 00:44:58,835
Come on, Daddy!

734
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,339
We got a call from Angelo Drive.

735
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:38,839
Found. Found.

736
00:45:50,822 --> 00:45:53,188
-ls he right in there?
-Yeah, sure, go on in.

737
00:45:53,392 --> 00:45:55,019
Thank you. l'm very sorry.

738
00:45:55,227 --> 00:45:56,489
That's okay.

739
00:46:15,447 --> 00:46:18,348
-lt's my Evie!
-Hi, Dad.

740
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:21,019
Come over here, Evie.

741
00:46:22,087 --> 00:46:26,956
l can't get up. l got myself in here,
and now l can't get up.

742
00:46:29,294 --> 00:46:30,556
How did you get here?

743
00:46:30,762 --> 00:46:33,629
Taxi. Best way to travel.
Don't forget that.

744
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:36,260
All right. l'll try not to.

745
00:46:36,601 --> 00:46:39,001
What's that over there?

746
00:46:39,905 --> 00:46:42,806
lt looks like some ginger
in a large vase.

747
00:46:43,041 --> 00:46:45,305
Maybe they like that kind of thing.

748
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:46,736
Who?

749
00:46:48,213 --> 00:46:50,477
The people that live in our house now.

750
00:46:56,221 --> 00:47:00,055
You know, sometimes l don't
recognize my own hands.

751
00:47:15,574 --> 00:47:17,565
Did you call Georgia?

752
00:47:19,177 --> 00:47:21,236
Yes. She's very worried.

753
00:47:21,446 --> 00:47:23,744
-How about Maddy?
-Her too.

754
00:47:25,851 --> 00:47:27,284
Call her.

755
00:47:28,587 --> 00:47:29,747
Who?

756
00:47:30,756 --> 00:47:33,691
She doesn't know l'm here.
Tell her to come.

757
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,090
Who? Mom?

758
00:47:36,695 --> 00:47:37,787
Yeah.

759
00:47:39,364 --> 00:47:40,626
-No, Dad.
-Come on.

760
00:47:40,832 --> 00:47:44,290
-l'm not gonna do that.
-l just gotta speak to her.

761
00:47:44,536 --> 00:47:45,969
l'm not going to do that.

762
00:47:46,171 --> 00:47:48,571
You don't have any clarity
when it comes to her.

763
00:47:48,774 --> 00:47:50,901
-What?
-You can't ask me to do that.

764
00:47:51,109 --> 00:47:52,667
l'm asking you as a favor!

765
00:47:52,878 --> 00:47:53,902
She doesn't like us!

766
00:47:54,112 --> 00:47:57,343
You locked me up because of Jesse,
didn't you?

767
00:47:57,783 --> 00:48:01,219
You put me in jail because of Jesse!

768
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:06,883
We'll make the big room into a bedroom.

769
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:11,495
This whole thing is like a dream.
Joe getting his own program on KCLU.

770
00:48:11,696 --> 00:48:14,597
Hello, Jesse! Come here, buddy.

771
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,825
Come here, birthday boy!

772
00:48:19,137 --> 00:48:22,334
-Look! Here's your first present.
-Thank you.

773
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:24,736
You have a phone!

774
00:48:25,043 --> 00:48:27,739
You know, we have to go up here
because guess what?

775
00:48:27,979 --> 00:48:30,038
Your daddy's got your costume ready.

776
00:48:30,482 --> 00:48:33,451
Hello, this is Jesse Marks speaking.

777
00:48:33,685 --> 00:48:35,550
Are you gonna be a clown?

778
00:48:37,622 --> 00:48:40,614
So, Eve, l've decided
to become an actress.

779
00:48:40,826 --> 00:48:41,850
Aren't you too old?

780
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,620
-How can you say that?
-You're almost 29.

781
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:47,128
Even our Georgia wrote that article;

782
00:48:47,332 --> 00:48:49,926
''5 Careers You Can't Have After 40,
5 You Can.''

783
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,329
Actress is a ''can't.''

784
00:48:51,536 --> 00:48:53,026
Like l read Vogue.

785
00:48:53,238 --> 00:48:56,674
No wonder they're firing her if
she's running articles like that.

786
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:59,343
They're firing her?
What are you saying?

787
00:48:59,544 --> 00:49:03,571
Carlo knows this fashion photographer,
and he said ad revenue is way down.

788
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:04,941
Who's Carlo?

789
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:09,651
Someone who happens to be important
to me. Anyway, he said she's history.

790
00:49:09,921 --> 00:49:13,084
That is terrible.
l really feel bad for her.

791
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:15,349
No, me too.

792
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:18,026
Georgia. Fired.

793
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:20,588
She'll be devastated.

794
00:49:21,399 --> 00:49:22,229
Does she know?

795
00:49:22,767 --> 00:49:24,428
l don't know. Should we tell her?

796
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,366
l don't know.
ls that bad, coming from us?

797
00:49:28,573 --> 00:49:31,167
-l'm not telling her.
-You should tell her.

798
00:49:31,376 --> 00:49:34,243
Why do l have to do everything?
l'm not gonna do that.

799
00:49:34,446 --> 00:49:37,938
This is, like, the 1 0th call
this week. Hi, Dad.

800
00:49:39,684 --> 00:49:40,878
lt's her!

801
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,913
How are you?

802
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:47,417
l have some news.

803
00:49:50,095 --> 00:49:51,824
-l think it happened.
-They fired her?

804
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:55,193
-What?
-Are you sitting down? Oh, God!

805
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,392
Guess what? l am starting
my own magazine!

806
00:49:58,603 --> 00:50:00,434
-What?
-Oh, my God!

807
00:50:00,739 --> 00:50:02,832
-She was fired.
-How is this possible?

808
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,903
And guess what l'm calling it.

809
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:07,902
Georgia.

810
00:50:08,113 --> 00:50:09,102
Really.

811
00:50:09,814 --> 00:50:11,475
Didn't l tell you?

812
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,914
-So she was fired.
-Well, probably.

813
00:50:16,121 --> 00:50:17,520
Let's just be happy for her.

814
00:50:17,722 --> 00:50:20,520
We didn't really want her out
on the street or anything.

815
00:50:20,725 --> 00:50:21,714
Did we?

816
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:25,385
She's gonna be more famous
than ever.

817
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:27,928
Thank God l'm changing my last name.

818
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,489
To what?

819
00:50:29,734 --> 00:50:33,602
Moore. Madeline Moore.
''l'm Madeline Moore, hi.''

820
00:50:35,173 --> 00:50:36,435
You don't hate her?

821
00:50:37,142 --> 00:50:40,441
The week her stuffing recipe came out
in The New York Times...

822
00:50:40,645 --> 00:50:43,842
...even my bank teller was like,
''Are you related to her?''

823
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:47,142
She doesn't even cook!
Where did she get that recipe from?

824
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:48,543
lt was mine.

825
00:50:49,154 --> 00:50:50,178
No!

826
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:53,049
That's the most horrible thing
l've heard of.

827
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:55,419
lt is, isn't it? Bitch!

828
00:50:55,627 --> 00:50:57,720
-That's good. That's healthy.
-Bitch!

829
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:00,022
That is so healthy for you to say that!

830
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,994
Good! l hope you blew up at her.

831
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,292
Well, no.

832
00:51:03,501 --> 00:51:05,298
You let her get away with anything.

833
00:51:05,503 --> 00:51:09,030
l can't get mad at Georgia.
She's the only mother l've got.

834
00:51:09,374 --> 00:51:11,934
That's pathetic. God.

835
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,272
This is the way l see it.

836
00:51:14,779 --> 00:51:19,307
lt's like we're on this racetrack, and
she's a Lamborghini and we're Hondas.

837
00:51:19,517 --> 00:51:23,954
Even though we're these really great
cars, and we get really high mileage...

838
00:51:24,155 --> 00:51:28,285
...anybody with any brains would rather
have a Honda than a Lamborghini.

839
00:51:28,493 --> 00:51:31,690
Well, the point is,
no matter how fast we go...

840
00:51:31,896 --> 00:51:34,763
...she keeps whipping around
that track faster and faster.

841
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,524
Okay, l am not a Honda.

842
00:51:36,735 --> 00:51:38,600
lt's just a metaphor.

843
00:51:38,803 --> 00:51:41,863
Well, you can feel about her
however you want...

844
00:51:42,073 --> 00:51:45,236
...but l'm not going through life
thinking l'm a jalopy.

845
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,977
You're not. l wouldn't be caught dead
driving one either.

846
00:51:50,215 --> 00:51:52,376
-''They get high mileage!''
-lt's a metaphor!

847
00:51:52,584 --> 00:51:55,052
-lt's a stupid metaphor!
-Well, l take it back!

848
00:51:55,253 --> 00:52:00,190
lf you weren't the only mother l've got,
l'd be mad at you for that metaphor.

849
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,084
l take it back.

850
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,853
And l need you too.

851
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:11,802
-Hondas get really good trade-in.
-Do they?

852
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:14,528
-l got chocolate all over your shirt.
-Really?

853
00:52:14,839 --> 00:52:15,774
Happy birthday to you

854
00:52:15,774 --> 00:52:18,265
Happy birthday to you

855
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,843
Happy birthday to you

856
00:52:22,047 --> 00:52:25,744
Happy birthday, dearJesse

857
00:52:26,284 --> 00:52:29,742
Happy birthday to you

858
00:52:35,794 --> 00:52:37,455
Wait! The hat, the hat!

859
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,186
Ready, steady.

860
00:52:43,601 --> 00:52:45,831
Look at your daddy!
Show how old you are!

861
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,129
Five years old!

862
00:52:49,741 --> 00:52:51,868
You did great! That was good.

863
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,712
Where the hell am l? Tijuana?

864
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,575
Hey, what are these midgets doing here?

865
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,886
Get out of my way!

866
00:53:09,627 --> 00:53:12,391
What is this?
A convention of midgets?

867
00:53:12,764 --> 00:53:15,892
Trick or treat, it's very sweet.
42nd Street.

868
00:53:16,101 --> 00:53:18,092
-l've seen him worse.
-Worse than this?

869
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:23,166
Hey, hi. l know you.
Miss Mouse, right? Miss Mousy.

870
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:26,976
-Miss Mousy.
-Why don't we go into the other room?

871
00:53:27,345 --> 00:53:29,575
l ran away from Cleo.

872
00:53:30,315 --> 00:53:32,249
-Come with me.
-You know what l mean?

873
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,142
Let's go into the kitchen.

874
00:53:34,352 --> 00:53:37,014
l don't want to go to--
You go to the kitchen!

875
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:38,552
Get out!

876
00:53:40,325 --> 00:53:41,553
You're coming with me.

877
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:43,853
Let go of me!

878
00:53:45,163 --> 00:53:46,630
You're coming with me now!

879
00:53:46,831 --> 00:53:49,766
My cake, Mommy. My cake!

880
00:53:50,168 --> 00:53:51,965
Here, here. Come here.

881
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:55,767
Come here.

882
00:54:00,044 --> 00:54:01,375
Please stay.

883
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:05,673
lt's Jesse's birthday.

884
00:54:07,152 --> 00:54:09,848
You go with your Aunt Maddy.
Just take over.

885
00:54:10,054 --> 00:54:12,318
Help her hand out those party favors.

886
00:54:12,524 --> 00:54:13,957
My dad.

887
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:19,119
Who wants a party favor? Come on,
Jesse. Let's see what we got.

888
00:54:20,532 --> 00:54:21,999
Come on, come on.

889
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,895
-Give me a drink.
-l'm not doing that, so forget it.

890
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:29,334
-l'll make him some coffee.
-Cleo, answer the phone!

891
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:31,475
Who is Cleo?

892
00:54:33,545 --> 00:54:37,641
This is my home, all right?
You just can't come into my home--!

893
00:54:37,849 --> 00:54:40,682
Cleo, answer the goddamn phone!

894
00:54:40,885 --> 00:54:43,479
Lou, why don't you try
the call later on?

895
00:54:44,722 --> 00:54:46,349
l know you.

896
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:51,558
You'd like to screw the little
Miss Mousy, wouldn't you?

897
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:53,926
l know what you're thinking.

898
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,564
Get out!

899
00:54:56,234 --> 00:54:58,998
What are you talking about, ''get out''?

900
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:01,932
A father comes to visit his daughter,
''get out.''

901
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,939
Your mother was right about you.
''Throw that one back.''

902
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,145
What?

903
00:55:08,379 --> 00:55:12,440
That's what she said. She took
one look. ''Throw that one back.''

904
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:16,946
She was right about you;
''Throw that one out!''

905
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,383
''Dump the creep.'' You bastard!

906
00:55:19,591 --> 00:55:22,116
Just get out!
Just get out, you bastard!

907
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,193
You're just awful!
Hateful bastard! Get out!

908
00:55:25,396 --> 00:55:26,590
How could he say that?

909
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,792
Thank you very much.

910
00:55:30,301 --> 00:55:31,529
lt's okay, baby.

911
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:34,898
Thank you, wonderful daughter.

912
00:55:41,746 --> 00:55:45,204
''Bastard.'' Thank you very much.

913
00:55:49,821 --> 00:55:51,914
Thank you very much!

914
00:56:03,368 --> 00:56:04,494
What happened?

915
00:56:07,038 --> 00:56:08,596
What did Dad do?

916
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,534
What did he do?

917
00:56:11,476 --> 00:56:12,807
Did you see him?

918
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:16,244
He's a drunk, Maddy! Damn it!

919
00:56:16,814 --> 00:56:18,748
He's just-- He's out there.

920
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:22,386
He's living a crazy, sick,
demented life.

921
00:56:28,826 --> 00:56:32,284
He's never setting foot
in this house again. ls that clear?

922
00:56:32,497 --> 00:56:33,623
Ever.

923
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,039
Oh, God!

924
00:56:45,677 --> 00:56:46,666
Here.

925
00:56:47,745 --> 00:56:50,270
l just feel awful.

926
00:56:57,188 --> 00:57:00,316
Cleo, answer the goddamn phone!

927
00:57:00,525 --> 00:57:02,891
Cleo, answer the goddamn phone!

928
00:57:04,262 --> 00:57:06,321
-A mini-stroke.
-What?

929
00:57:06,531 --> 00:57:09,796
-Dr. Kelly swears he'll recover.
-That's good news.

930
00:57:10,001 --> 00:57:12,765
Dad wants me to call Mom, and l....

931
00:57:13,204 --> 00:57:15,172
l just can't. l won't--

932
00:57:15,373 --> 00:57:17,898
Now, please. You'll be all right.

933
00:57:18,109 --> 00:57:20,077
-What? What's the matter?.
-Omar.

934
00:57:20,278 --> 00:57:21,142
Omar who?

935
00:57:21,346 --> 00:57:25,214
He's just a doctor who's gonna
slap me with a gigantic bill.

936
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:28,647
That's whyyou have to force Dad
to sign a blank check.

937
00:57:28,853 --> 00:57:30,013
What?

938
00:57:30,221 --> 00:57:34,783
lfhe has a maxi-stroke, we can get
everything out ofhis bank account.

939
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,858
He could need round-the-clock care.

940
00:57:37,061 --> 00:57:41,122
l can't deal with this right now.
Call me later, sweets. Bye.

941
00:57:52,143 --> 00:57:54,134
Hello, coffee machine.

942
00:58:05,256 --> 00:58:06,382
Come on.

943
00:58:08,593 --> 00:58:12,154
Oh, come on! Come on! Just work!

944
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:15,127
Something just has to goddamn work!

945
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:18,791
What are you doing? Crashing,
banging all the time. See this?

946
00:58:19,003 --> 00:58:23,667
This is a coffee machine in a hospital,
and it doesn't work.

947
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:28,107
The people who come here need to have
some coffee when they're waiting.

948
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,013
You are still at large.

949
00:58:30,214 --> 00:58:32,182
-My God.
-l'm very sorry.

950
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,217
lt's nice to see you.

951
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:39,656
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

952
00:58:39,857 --> 00:58:41,518
My father had a mini-stroke.

953
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,819
l'm very sorry to hear that.
But you have--

954
00:58:44,028 --> 00:58:45,461
Excuse me.

955
00:58:46,531 --> 00:58:48,965
-What do you want?
-Hi, Kim. What's wrong now?

956
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,725
Don't ask me. l'm returning
your call. Hello?

957
00:58:51,936 --> 00:58:53,995
-l called you?
-Yes, you called me.

958
00:58:54,205 --> 00:58:56,332
l'll probably be here for a while...

959
00:58:56,541 --> 00:59:00,705
...so would you please make sure
to pick up Jesse from the school...

960
00:59:01,112 --> 00:59:04,548
...give him his snack, do not forget.
Did you call the Nixon Library?

961
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:06,011
Why would l do that?

962
00:59:06,217 --> 00:59:09,675
Why?! Because the party
is tomorrow, Kim.

963
00:59:09,887 --> 00:59:12,981
And call Georgia and make sure
she's got her plane ticket.

964
00:59:13,224 --> 00:59:15,419
God! Unbelievable person!

965
00:59:15,626 --> 00:59:17,958
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

966
00:59:18,162 --> 00:59:21,427
Thank you.
Did you decide about the car?

967
00:59:21,966 --> 00:59:22,796
Yes.

968
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,264
-Very expensive.
-Very expensive?

969
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:28,166
You don't have to tell
my insurance company.

970
00:59:28,406 --> 00:59:31,466
Maybe you have to tell
the insurance company.

971
00:59:31,676 --> 00:59:34,201
Mercedes mechanic very honest but--

972
00:59:34,412 --> 00:59:36,141
Very honest. l'm sure about that.

973
00:59:36,347 --> 00:59:38,338
Tomorrow he's going to give me the....

974
00:59:38,583 --> 00:59:40,517
What do you call it?

975
00:59:40,751 --> 00:59:42,912
-Estimates.
-Right.

976
00:59:43,154 --> 00:59:46,146
l can't believe l remembered that word.
l can't believe it.

977
00:59:46,357 --> 00:59:50,623
l can't remember the name of this blond,
bland actress from the '50s...

978
00:59:50,828 --> 00:59:54,594
...who was short and always suffering.
ls that a normal thing?

979
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,632
A little bit of forgetting is nothing.

980
00:59:57,835 --> 00:59:59,268
When you are upset, it's--

981
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,802
Wait, hold on. Excuse me. Sorry.

982
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:04,968
Herplane tickets didn't arrive.

983
01:00:05,276 --> 01:00:08,803
Well, then, Kim, will you call Fed-Ex!

984
01:00:09,614 --> 01:00:11,138
God!

985
01:00:13,317 --> 01:00:14,784
God!

986
01:00:16,354 --> 01:00:17,981
Where is your husband?

987
01:00:18,189 --> 01:00:21,386
He's in South Dakota,
where they have beautiful sunsets.

988
01:00:23,027 --> 01:00:24,619
You need a prescription.

989
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:27,297
For what? What do l need
a prescription for?

990
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:29,125
l'm gonna tell you.

991
01:00:29,634 --> 01:00:31,625
lt's very nearby. You're in luck.

992
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:34,733
Thank you. lt was nice to see you.

993
01:00:35,473 --> 01:00:36,701
Man!

994
01:00:40,144 --> 01:00:42,510
Olivia de Havilland. Was it?

995
01:00:42,713 --> 01:00:43,702
No.

996
01:00:43,915 --> 01:00:45,212
Kim Novak?

997
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:51,511
Okay, so, what?

998
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:57,825
Georgia thinks that you should
sign a blank check...

999
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,792
...in case we need some money.

1000
01:00:59,997 --> 01:01:01,624
She needs dough?

1001
01:01:01,832 --> 01:01:04,665
No. She thinks that you should
sign a blank check.

1002
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,427
She broke?

1003
01:01:07,338 --> 01:01:08,464
No, Dad.

1004
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:11,467
She just thinks that you should
sign this check.

1005
01:01:11,842 --> 01:01:16,779
Seems to go against all the rules
of civilized existence.

1006
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:22,447
ln case we need to get money out
of your account to hire--

1007
01:01:22,687 --> 01:01:24,154
-For who?
-For you.

1008
01:01:24,355 --> 01:01:26,516
We don't have to make out
a blank check.

1009
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:30,554
We'll make out a check for whatever
purposes we need a check for.

1010
01:01:30,761 --> 01:01:33,457
lt makes it much easier for us
if you would sign--

1011
01:01:33,698 --> 01:01:37,156
Take this pen. Just take the pen
and sign your name right here.

1012
01:01:37,368 --> 01:01:40,064
l'm not gonna sign my name
on a blank check.

1013
01:01:40,271 --> 01:01:41,704
Sign the check, please!

1014
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:43,897
ls that Eve Marks?

1015
01:01:45,209 --> 01:01:47,234
l am Ogmed Kunundar.

1016
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:49,940
-Who?
-Omar's mother.

1017
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:56,042
Omar says you do not have an arm
or a shoulder for leaning on.

1018
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:58,347
l don't. l don't, no.

1019
01:01:58,556 --> 01:01:59,887
l am here.

1020
01:02:01,626 --> 01:02:02,854
How are you today?

1021
01:02:03,327 --> 01:02:04,885
Patsy?

1022
01:02:05,496 --> 01:02:06,690
Not Mom.

1023
01:02:06,897 --> 01:02:08,330
You're wearing a wig?

1024
01:02:08,566 --> 01:02:12,332
No, Dad. This is not Mom.
lt's Ogmed Kunundar.

1025
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:15,403
Then do me a favor.
Piss off, will you?

1026
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:19,176
Get out of here with that
ill-fitting wig!

1027
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:20,799
Piss off, will you?

1028
01:02:21,012 --> 01:02:23,674
l'm really-- l'm very, very sorry.
l apologize.

1029
01:02:23,914 --> 01:02:28,817
You want to go get some coffee
or tea or something? Excuse us.

1030
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,951
lt's the first rule in business;

1031
01:02:31,155 --> 01:02:34,318
Never sign a blank check,
because you'll wind up...

1032
01:02:34,592 --> 01:02:38,688
...in the you-know-where.
ln the old craperooney.

1033
01:02:41,332 --> 01:02:44,096
-How about here?
-That's great. Yeah, sure.

1034
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:47,067
l'm very sorry about my father.

1035
01:02:47,505 --> 01:02:48,972
You know what l see?

1036
01:02:49,173 --> 01:02:51,004
l see your father.

1037
01:02:51,242 --> 01:02:53,802
He is an uproar man,
just like Ayatollah...

1038
01:02:54,011 --> 01:02:56,445
...and that is why l leave Persia.

1039
01:02:56,647 --> 01:03:01,209
The Ayatollah, he is never happy
unless everyone is upset all the time.

1040
01:03:01,419 --> 01:03:05,150
Your father, he has
a bad case of uproar.

1041
01:03:05,356 --> 01:03:07,824
But not so bad as the Ayatollah.

1042
01:03:15,966 --> 01:03:17,160
Sorry.

1043
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:21,670
He's always been such a nightmare.

1044
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:25,032
You love your father very much.

1045
01:03:25,276 --> 01:03:26,766
Oh, l do?

1046
01:03:27,278 --> 01:03:31,840
l don't know how l could. How could l
possibly love this nutcase?

1047
01:03:33,451 --> 01:03:36,716
Now he's dying, and l'm stuck with him.
l'm stuck with him.

1048
01:03:36,954 --> 01:03:40,651
This mess is my father
forever and ever?

1049
01:03:41,826 --> 01:03:44,727
He'll never clean up his act.
He'll never get it together.

1050
01:03:44,962 --> 01:03:47,692
He's never gonna give me wisdom.

1051
01:03:49,467 --> 01:03:50,991
Comfort.

1052
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:55,035
And he wants something from me.

1053
01:03:57,174 --> 01:03:58,903
He wants me to call my mother.

1054
01:03:59,744 --> 01:04:01,939
And she's gonna refuse to come.

1055
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:04,641
And he knows it.

1056
01:04:05,549 --> 01:04:09,315
He knows it. l swear, somewhere
in there, he knows it...

1057
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,387
...and it's gonna break
his heart anyway.

1058
01:04:14,759 --> 01:04:17,057
And l don't want to do it.

1059
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:21,062
l don't want to do it. l can't.

1060
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:23,992
l just can't.

1061
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:29,001
We must make two toasts.

1062
01:04:34,278 --> 01:04:35,905
To your bravery.

1063
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,680
To my bravery.

1064
01:04:40,017 --> 01:04:41,951
And to your grief.

1065
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:44,516
To my grief.

1066
01:05:04,942 --> 01:05:06,432
His machine.

1067
01:05:06,977 --> 01:05:08,569
Omar, this is your mother.

1068
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:13,580
l am here with Eve. She has too many
worries. She should not have to pay.

1069
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:17,276
One ovary will pay for three cars,
and that will be the end of it.

1070
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:20,890
You don't have to do that.
That accident was my fault.

1071
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:23,286
Fault is never the point.

1072
01:05:26,797 --> 01:05:29,061
You are a very warm person.

1073
01:05:30,067 --> 01:05:33,662
What makes me think you got
this warmth from your father?

1074
01:05:36,073 --> 01:05:37,597
l don't know what to do.

1075
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:40,743
What do you think l should do?
What should l do?

1076
01:05:42,112 --> 01:05:43,511
Would you press ''end''?

1077
01:05:43,747 --> 01:05:46,511
l never could seem to find the ''end.''

1078
01:05:47,918 --> 01:05:51,979
You know, sometimes it is necessary
to disconnect.

1079
01:06:05,669 --> 01:06:07,296
About Mom....

1080
01:06:08,973 --> 01:06:11,168
There was an earthquake.

1081
01:06:11,709 --> 01:06:12,869
A big one.

1082
01:06:14,712 --> 01:06:15,940
ln Big Bear.

1083
01:06:16,146 --> 01:06:17,977
A nine-point...

1084
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:20,844
...eleven...

1085
01:06:21,552 --> 01:06:23,452
...on the Richter scale.

1086
01:06:24,455 --> 01:06:27,356
And the house that she lived in...

1087
01:06:28,058 --> 01:06:30,356
...wasn't really very strong.

1088
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:34,327
Especially the doorways.

1089
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:38,632
And you know how you're always
supposed to stand in the doorways.

1090
01:06:40,337 --> 01:06:41,531
Dead?

1091
01:06:53,918 --> 01:06:55,476
l won.

1092
01:07:01,825 --> 01:07:03,417
Yes, you did.

1093
01:07:21,512 --> 01:07:22,911
Hey, Jesse.

1094
01:07:23,213 --> 01:07:24,407
l'm home.

1095
01:07:24,615 --> 01:07:26,105
Hi, Mom.

1096
01:07:40,864 --> 01:07:42,991
Eve, dear, it's Madge.

1097
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,000
Regarding the party tomorrow,
how about having nametags?

1098
01:07:47,204 --> 01:07:51,766
There are only about 500 women coming.
l thought ifyou got up early, you'd--

1099
01:07:51,976 --> 01:07:53,204
Do you do calligraphy?

1100
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:59,582
There. Good dog!

1101
01:09:01,879 --> 01:09:04,871
Do you think we made a mistake,
not having nametags?

1102
01:09:05,115 --> 01:09:09,779
Because there's just never a moment
then that you can't remember a name.

1103
01:09:09,987 --> 01:09:11,852
lt's just that that would be amazing.

1104
01:09:12,056 --> 01:09:14,547
l hope that Georgia's plane landed.

1105
01:09:14,792 --> 01:09:16,225
l think it should have.

1106
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:20,920
l can't remember which flight
she was on, if it was 845, 854...

1107
01:09:21,131 --> 01:09:22,325
...but l wouldn't worry.

1108
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:24,330
Oh, my God, it's Georgia!

1109
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:31,137
lt's Georgia!

1110
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:34,541
lt's Georgia.

1111
01:09:35,312 --> 01:09:36,279
There she is!

1112
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:39,648
Oh, honey!

1113
01:09:42,519 --> 01:09:44,612
When did everybody start
kissing air? lt's--

1114
01:09:44,822 --> 01:09:46,585
Affected. l know. Look at this!

1115
01:09:46,824 --> 01:09:47,916
Hot off the press!

1116
01:09:49,993 --> 01:09:51,654
Oh, it's so beautiful!

1117
01:09:52,196 --> 01:09:55,222
-Madge Turner. l'm head of it all.
-Hello, Madge!

1118
01:09:55,432 --> 01:09:57,696
l'm Martin. l'll be your liaison.

1119
01:09:58,502 --> 01:10:00,732
l don't want any more lights.

1120
01:10:04,942 --> 01:10:06,603
l hope you'll sign the cover!

1121
01:10:07,277 --> 01:10:10,576
And we would love for you to write
an article for our newsletter.

1122
01:10:17,688 --> 01:10:20,623
Let me just talk to Georgia
just for a second.

1123
01:10:20,858 --> 01:10:22,849
Look at you. Aren't you gorgeous?

1124
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:25,392
-Did you get the banner?
-lt's behind the podium.

1125
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:28,224
Thank God. You're so brilliant.
How's Daddy?

1126
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:29,729
He could go at any minute.

1127
01:10:29,933 --> 01:10:31,798
Don't tug at your face.

1128
01:10:32,035 --> 01:10:33,502
l'm not tugging, l'm mushing.

1129
01:10:33,704 --> 01:10:36,605
You cannot do that.
You know your face is falling.

1130
01:10:36,807 --> 01:10:39,275
And your nose never stops growing.

1131
01:10:39,476 --> 01:10:42,934
My nose and my ears.
You always tell me. l know.

1132
01:10:43,147 --> 01:10:44,910
No, but l can look short.

1133
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:46,309
l gotta go.

1134
01:10:47,718 --> 01:10:49,447
We need to get going, Georgia.

1135
01:10:49,653 --> 01:10:52,713
Several VlPs are waiting
for a photo with you.

1136
01:10:55,392 --> 01:10:57,451
Thank you so much. That's enough.

1137
01:10:57,661 --> 01:10:59,891
No, really. Stop!

1138
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:03,395
Thank you so much.
l'm sort of embarrassed.

1139
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,227
Look at this.

1140
01:11:05,969 --> 01:11:08,096
What a surprise!

1141
01:11:08,839 --> 01:11:10,739
Thank you!

1142
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:15,142
lt's so nice to be back
in Los Angeles again.

1143
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:18,510
All right, that's enough.
Thank you. Stop.

1144
01:11:18,749 --> 01:11:21,946
Really, you have to stop. Thanks.
All right, anyway....

1145
01:11:23,987 --> 01:11:26,182
l'm so excited to be here.

1146
01:11:26,456 --> 01:11:30,017
l was on the plane going over my speech,
the speech l always give...

1147
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:34,253
...and of course l talk about
Georgia, my magazine...

1148
01:11:34,498 --> 01:11:38,298
...which is about to celebrate
its fifth anniversary.

1149
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:40,265
Can you believe that?

1150
01:11:42,539 --> 01:11:45,736
l was going to talk about
the issue of face-lifts;

1151
01:11:45,943 --> 01:11:47,535
To do or not to do.

1152
01:11:48,812 --> 01:11:50,074
About aging.

1153
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:52,979
About the fact that
it's okay to age...

1154
01:11:53,183 --> 01:11:55,174
...but, of course,
l don't believe that.

1155
01:11:56,353 --> 01:11:59,151
Anyway, l was sitting
on the plane and...

1156
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:02,520
...l realized l didn't want
to talk about any of that...

1157
01:12:02,726 --> 01:12:05,854
...because something
very important is happening.

1158
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:09,666
And that's what l wanna talk about.

1159
01:12:14,972 --> 01:12:17,236
My father is in the hospital.

1160
01:12:19,576 --> 01:12:21,043
My father...

1161
01:12:22,579 --> 01:12:23,705
...is dying.

1162
01:12:23,914 --> 01:12:26,382
This has been the hardest
challenge of my life;

1163
01:12:26,583 --> 01:12:31,520
To put out the fifth anniversary edition
while my father's life slips away.

1164
01:12:32,522 --> 01:12:37,152
Any of you who have lost a parent
knows how wrenching it is...

1165
01:12:37,361 --> 01:12:41,297
...to see your mother
or your father's life ebb.

1166
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:44,232
Excuse me.

1167
01:12:45,836 --> 01:12:47,565
This is so embarrassing for me.

1168
01:12:48,338 --> 01:12:51,933
But as upset as l was...

1169
01:12:52,276 --> 01:12:55,302
...l forged on because l knew that...

1170
01:12:55,512 --> 01:12:59,278
...that is what my father
would want me to do.

1171
01:12:59,683 --> 01:13:03,278
lncredible. We spend our lives
at that hospital.

1172
01:13:03,854 --> 01:13:05,185
We?!

1173
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:08,850
--of the daddy that l love.

1174
01:13:11,094 --> 01:13:15,360
As we embark on the new millennium
we must ask ourselves this;

1175
01:13:15,565 --> 01:13:19,160
How can we be there for our parents
as they were there for us?

1176
01:13:19,369 --> 01:13:21,428
This is what l call the ''Next Hurdle'';

1177
01:13:21,872 --> 01:13:26,809
Dealing with the death of our parents
while confronting our own mortality.

1178
01:13:27,044 --> 01:13:30,844
And l promise you,
each and every one of you...

1179
01:13:31,048 --> 01:13:34,108
...that Georgia the magazine
and Georgia the person...

1180
01:13:34,318 --> 01:13:37,344
...will help you deal with this
every step of the way.

1181
01:13:37,721 --> 01:13:39,052
Thank you.

1182
01:13:39,589 --> 01:13:42,319
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1183
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:44,727
Thank you so much.

1184
01:13:45,595 --> 01:13:47,495
She's wonderful.

1185
01:13:48,398 --> 01:13:49,695
Oh, come on!

1186
01:13:50,067 --> 01:13:52,058
Absolutely incredible.

1187
01:13:53,503 --> 01:13:54,731
Thank you!

1188
01:13:57,574 --> 01:13:59,565
We'll do this together!

1189
01:14:01,311 --> 01:14:03,643
You're all sweet. l love you.

1190
01:14:03,847 --> 01:14:08,784
For anyone interested, l'll be signing
autographs in the Pat Nixon suite.

1191
01:14:10,854 --> 01:14:14,381
l think you want to talk
to Madge Turner.

1192
01:14:14,591 --> 01:14:16,616
Well, that was a success.

1193
01:14:19,029 --> 01:14:19,859
Something wrong?

1194
01:14:20,297 --> 01:14:22,322
-l can't believe what you did.
-What?

1195
01:14:22,532 --> 01:14:24,193
And you always do it!

1196
01:14:24,434 --> 01:14:28,131
You take my life, and you use it.
l'm the one who's been here, not you.

1197
01:14:28,338 --> 01:14:31,603
Wait a minute! When did l take
your life and use it?

1198
01:14:31,808 --> 01:14:33,867
The stuffing recipe.

1199
01:14:34,811 --> 01:14:38,577
What stuffing recipe?
l don't even make stuffing!

1200
01:14:38,782 --> 01:14:41,478
l invented a stuffing recipe
with apples and apricots...

1201
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:43,983
...and you gave it
to The New York Times.

1202
01:14:44,187 --> 01:14:45,882
-Yes, well, didn't l ask?
-No!

1203
01:14:46,123 --> 01:14:48,216
You didn't ask, and you haven't helped.

1204
01:14:48,692 --> 01:14:50,922
Where are you going?
Just wait a second!

1205
01:14:51,128 --> 01:14:55,428
How many times have l asked for
the tiniest mention in your magazine?

1206
01:14:55,632 --> 01:14:59,466
What does that have to do with anything?
Just stay on the subject!

1207
01:14:59,669 --> 01:15:02,832
So you can yell at me,
but you can't yell at her?

1208
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:06,100
Gee whiz! l will put you
in the magazine!

1209
01:15:06,309 --> 01:15:08,903
Don't you dare!
That is so manipulative!

1210
01:15:09,146 --> 01:15:13,674
So manipulative! l have been
the one dealing with Dad. Not you!

1211
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:17,980
You order me to get him to sign a blank
check, talk to a real doctor--

1212
01:15:18,188 --> 01:15:22,989
And l understand how important it is
to make the world safe for liposuction!

1213
01:15:23,226 --> 01:15:26,423
But l just wanna say
l am sick of it!

1214
01:15:27,931 --> 01:15:30,161
l mean, wait a second, Eve!

1215
01:15:31,535 --> 01:15:33,332
l admit that l haven't been there.

1216
01:15:33,537 --> 01:15:34,868
You admit it?!

1217
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:38,803
-l took calls from him all those years.
-Your assistant did!

1218
01:15:39,009 --> 01:15:42,240
-l told you, you need an assistant.
-l have an assistant!

1219
01:15:42,446 --> 01:15:44,311
That's not what we call an assistant.

1220
01:15:44,514 --> 01:15:45,640
He needed me.

1221
01:15:45,849 --> 01:15:47,316
And you just goddamn love it!

1222
01:15:47,517 --> 01:15:50,281
lt's not Eve's fault!
Dad depended on her.

1223
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:54,456
Will you mind your own business?
l can fight my own battles!

1224
01:15:54,691 --> 01:15:57,990
Wait! Why are you having
a family fight without me?

1225
01:15:58,195 --> 01:16:00,129
You always ignore me!

1226
01:16:00,363 --> 01:16:03,423
From that Halloween l was 5
and dressed as a carrot.

1227
01:16:03,633 --> 01:16:07,296
You snuck out of the house and
went trick-or-treating without me!

1228
01:16:07,537 --> 01:16:08,765
l'm part of this family!

1229
01:16:08,972 --> 01:16:12,499
l'm just as much a part of this family
as you, and l wanna fight!

1230
01:16:12,709 --> 01:16:13,733
-Fine!
-Good!

1231
01:16:13,944 --> 01:16:16,037
You are so self-centered
and egotistical!

1232
01:16:16,246 --> 01:16:17,508
You're so self-sacrificing!

1233
01:16:17,714 --> 01:16:19,477
No one takes me seriously
as an actress!

1234
01:16:19,716 --> 01:16:20,978
You abandon your father.

1235
01:16:21,218 --> 01:16:23,709
He didn't need me here! He's got you!

1236
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,820
That is an unbelievable cop-out!

1237
01:16:26,056 --> 01:16:27,250
No one watches my show!

1238
01:16:27,457 --> 01:16:29,288
Another excuse for you
not to be here!

1239
01:16:29,493 --> 01:16:32,257
l couldn't be here! l cannot be here!

1240
01:16:32,462 --> 01:16:36,057
You wanna know why? lf anything
happens that's not about you...

1241
01:16:36,666 --> 01:16:38,258
...you are bored witless!

1242
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:40,993
That is true. Okay?

1243
01:16:41,638 --> 01:16:43,071
Besides, we're not famous.

1244
01:16:43,273 --> 01:16:46,470
Which is another reason
she didn't bother to come.

1245
01:16:46,676 --> 01:16:50,271
l've told you a million times. Stop
talking to me as if l'm like you!

1246
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:51,674
Oh, fuck you!

1247
01:16:51,915 --> 01:16:52,904
And fuck you!

1248
01:16:53,416 --> 01:16:55,384
-Excuse me.
-What? Oh, God!

1249
01:16:55,585 --> 01:16:57,314
You have a phone call.

1250
01:17:09,466 --> 01:17:12,094
Did Mitchell know to any degree
what was going on?

1251
01:17:12,302 --> 01:17:13,132
Who is this?

1252
01:17:13,336 --> 01:17:17,204
That's the President's smoking-gun
call with Haldeman. Talk on this.

1253
01:17:21,811 --> 01:17:23,574
Yes, this is Eve Marks.

1254
01:17:29,819 --> 01:17:31,081
Oh, my God.

1255
01:17:34,024 --> 01:17:35,855
-What happened?
-He's in a coma.

1256
01:17:36,059 --> 01:17:37,356
l'm going to the hospital.

1257
01:17:37,561 --> 01:17:39,188
So am l.

1258
01:17:40,330 --> 01:17:41,820
So am l!

1259
01:18:24,307 --> 01:18:28,038
Wait! Wait for me.
What's the big rush, you guys?

1260
01:18:32,716 --> 01:18:33,683
Hello, what?

1261
01:18:35,785 --> 01:18:39,243
No, l can't right now, all right?
l'll talk to you later.

1262
01:18:43,159 --> 01:18:44,319
lt's here.

1263
01:18:45,795 --> 01:18:46,819
Oh, my God.

1264
01:18:55,905 --> 01:18:57,065
Dad?

1265
01:19:07,951 --> 01:19:09,145
Dad?

1266
01:19:10,587 --> 01:19:13,021
-Can he hear us?
-Why does he have one pillow?

1267
01:19:13,523 --> 01:19:16,754
A person can't possibly be
comfortable with one-- What?

1268
01:19:17,427 --> 01:19:18,416
What?

1269
01:19:19,629 --> 01:19:23,622
Are you not going to speak to me?
ls that what this is about?

1270
01:19:23,967 --> 01:19:26,595
Why aren't you talking to me?
l didn't do anything.

1271
01:19:26,803 --> 01:19:28,794
l see. And l did. ls that it?

1272
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:31,937
This is just--
This is really great.

1273
01:19:32,709 --> 01:19:34,301
This is really great.

1274
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:42,618
Can you believe she's
making this about herself?

1275
01:19:46,222 --> 01:19:47,314
Fine.

1276
01:19:47,791 --> 01:19:49,622
Don't talk to me. Good.

1277
01:20:59,562 --> 01:21:01,530
Do l have anything in my teeth?

1278
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:13,375
You're not the only one
that this is happening to.

1279
01:21:15,311 --> 01:21:16,471
l know.

1280
01:21:17,213 --> 01:21:18,544
Sorry.

1281
01:21:21,217 --> 01:21:24,983
But since l'm an actress,
l suppose l could use this stuff.

1282
01:21:25,221 --> 01:21:27,052
That's the good part, right?

1283
01:21:27,957 --> 01:21:30,391
The sad part is that
l really love Dad.

1284
01:21:34,397 --> 01:21:35,887
l'm his baby.

1285
01:21:38,601 --> 01:21:41,161
Do you want a candy bar?
l'm getting a candy bar.

1286
01:21:46,376 --> 01:21:51,245
Excuse me. Aren't you
Juliana on Living Dangerously?.

1287
01:21:51,748 --> 01:21:53,045
Yes. Yes, l am.

1288
01:21:53,249 --> 01:21:55,843
You should have never
gone to the Bahamas...

1289
01:21:56,085 --> 01:21:57,746
...because he cheated on you.

1290
01:21:57,954 --> 01:21:59,080
Thanks.

1291
01:22:00,089 --> 01:22:02,182
She recognized me!

1292
01:22:05,962 --> 01:22:08,089
Georgia, someone just recognized me!

1293
01:22:08,932 --> 01:22:10,297
Great.

1294
01:22:30,119 --> 01:22:31,313
Thank you.

1295
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,717
All right, look.
l know what you said.

1296
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,860
-About what?
-That l wanted it.

1297
01:22:39,062 --> 01:22:41,860
Forget it.
l'm sorry l said that, Eve.

1298
01:22:44,067 --> 01:22:47,332
There are things that happen
that you just don't choose.

1299
01:22:47,537 --> 01:22:48,868
You know, they just....

1300
01:22:49,405 --> 01:22:52,135
You embrace them, and they become
part of your identity.

1301
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:55,573
And Mom left Dad to me. Or at least--
l don't know.

1302
01:22:55,812 --> 01:22:59,213
lt felt like she did.
And part of me was so...

1303
01:23:00,683 --> 01:23:02,207
...proud.

1304
01:23:03,052 --> 01:23:06,681
Then the other part of me just
resented every second of it...

1305
01:23:06,890 --> 01:23:09,859
...because he is just a handful.

1306
01:23:10,827 --> 01:23:14,729
l should have been here. l should've
been here, and l know that.

1307
01:23:14,931 --> 01:23:17,695
But l knew that if you were here,
he didn't need me.

1308
01:23:17,901 --> 01:23:19,493
l mean, let's face it.

1309
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:22,897
God help anyone who needs me.

1310
01:23:26,075 --> 01:23:27,906
l needed you.

1311
01:23:29,412 --> 01:23:32,210
He didn't need you. l needed you.

1312
01:23:33,016 --> 01:23:34,415
l'm sorry.

1313
01:23:36,452 --> 01:23:38,181
l'm very sorry, all right?

1314
01:23:38,922 --> 01:23:41,356
-l'm really sorry.
-l'm sorry too.

1315
01:23:43,026 --> 01:23:46,518
l love you very much.
Do you know that?

1316
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:48,754
l love you, and....

1317
01:23:49,165 --> 01:23:50,792
l gave you that great speech.

1318
01:23:51,034 --> 01:23:52,865
Yes, yes, you did.

1319
01:23:53,603 --> 01:23:54,865
And l'm very grateful.

1320
01:23:55,071 --> 01:23:57,801
Okay, you're grateful. Shut up.

1321
01:23:59,876 --> 01:24:01,366
You know, Eve...

1322
01:24:03,046 --> 01:24:06,880
...l have never been jealous of anyone
in my entire life, but...

1323
01:24:08,585 --> 01:24:10,280
...l have to admit that...

1324
01:24:12,221 --> 01:24:15,122
...l am just the tiniest bit
jealous of your heart.

1325
01:24:24,734 --> 01:24:26,725
-You forgive me?
-l love you. l do.

1326
01:24:26,936 --> 01:24:28,460
l love you.

1327
01:24:34,243 --> 01:24:35,471
Who does Dad look like?

1328
01:24:35,678 --> 01:24:38,408
Now he looks like that senator.
What was his name?

1329
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:41,379
The one who got insulted,
and his wife cried.

1330
01:24:41,584 --> 01:24:42,949
Edmund Muskie.

1331
01:24:43,152 --> 01:24:44,414
Yes!

1332
01:24:45,088 --> 01:24:46,385
Who was Edmund Muskie?

1333
01:24:46,589 --> 01:24:48,750
l've been trying
to remember the name...

1334
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:53,418
...of this short, blond actress
from the '50s, or maybe it was the '40s.

1335
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:55,996
-What about Vera-Ellen?
-No. Very thin hair.

1336
01:24:56,199 --> 01:24:57,325
Donna Reed.

1337
01:24:57,533 --> 01:25:00,593
-Janet Leigh.
-Donna Reed wasn't short or blond.

1338
01:25:00,803 --> 01:25:02,100
Doris Day. l'm right.

1339
01:25:02,305 --> 01:25:03,465
Cleo!

1340
01:25:06,109 --> 01:25:07,076
Who was she?

1341
01:25:07,276 --> 01:25:09,836
-Who was she?
-Daddy's favorite.

1342
01:25:10,113 --> 01:25:12,138
He picked her up in
an ltalian restaurant.

1343
01:25:12,348 --> 01:25:13,212
Wait a minute.

1344
01:25:13,449 --> 01:25:15,815
She played wimps,
and she was kind of wide.

1345
01:25:16,019 --> 01:25:17,646
Doris Day. Wide.

1346
01:25:17,987 --> 01:25:21,252
Please tell me and give me
peace of mind.

1347
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:24,956
June Allyson.

1348
01:25:29,298 --> 01:25:30,458
Dad?

1349
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:31,964
Oh, Daddy!

1350
01:25:33,636 --> 01:25:36,366
Did he talk? He said, ''June Allyson''!

1351
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:39,631
Did you just say, ''June Allyson''?
Nurse!

1352
01:25:41,878 --> 01:25:44,847
He's coming around!
He just said, ''June Allyson.''

1353
01:25:45,048 --> 01:25:46,345
Check and see. lt's fine.

1354
01:25:46,549 --> 01:25:49,074
-Doesn't start with an ''L.''
-lt almost does.

1355
01:25:49,485 --> 01:25:51,510
Maddy, it almost starts with an ''L.''

1356
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:18,442
Dad?

1357
01:26:28,691 --> 01:26:31,626
He said, ''June Allyson.'' He's dead.

1358
01:27:10,566 --> 01:27:12,898
Evie, John Waynejust called.

1359
01:27:13,102 --> 01:27:14,899
Tell Georgia! Tell Maddy!

1360
01:27:15,338 --> 01:27:19,297
Georgie-Porgie! Evie-baby!

1361
01:27:19,509 --> 01:27:24,344
l love all my beautiful,
beautiful girls.

1362
01:27:27,116 --> 01:27:28,981
lt's my Evie.

1363
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:33,146
Look how beautiful you are
in the snow.

1364
01:27:35,024 --> 01:27:38,687
That's my Evie. That's my cookie.

1365
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:49,772
Did you take--? You did.

1366
01:27:49,972 --> 01:27:51,837
You took every almond out of here.

1367
01:27:52,041 --> 01:27:53,599
Every single one.

1368
01:27:56,712 --> 01:27:57,838
What about the celery?

1369
01:27:58,047 --> 01:27:59,275
Did you listen to me?

1370
01:27:59,849 --> 01:28:01,373
Georgia, it looks exactly right.

1371
01:28:01,617 --> 01:28:04,279
Are these onions supposed
to get this limp?

1372
01:28:04,487 --> 01:28:06,887
Yes, they are. lt's called cooking.

1373
01:28:07,123 --> 01:28:10,320
That's what happens to an onion.
But wait. See?

1374
01:28:10,526 --> 01:28:14,223
That looks very good.
You have made my stuffing.

1375
01:28:15,164 --> 01:28:17,564
Let me see what this is like.
All right.

1376
01:28:20,236 --> 01:28:21,601
This is so good!

1377
01:28:21,804 --> 01:28:23,328
lt's so good!

1378
01:28:23,539 --> 01:28:26,702
l can't believe you guys are doing
this. l can't believe it.

1379
01:28:26,909 --> 01:28:29,434
-Does it need more apricots?
-lt doesn't need anything!

1380
01:28:29,645 --> 01:28:32,375
Please sit and have fun.
Enjoy your life.

1381
01:28:32,582 --> 01:28:36,518
We're supposed to put the stuffing
inside the bird with our hands?

1382
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:39,620
You have to stuff it way
to the back of the bird.

1383
01:28:39,822 --> 01:28:42,120
lt'll be goopy and awful,
but you have to do it.

1384
01:28:42,325 --> 01:28:44,156
Well, you enjoy that.

1385
01:28:46,329 --> 01:28:48,092
That's my gift to you.

1386
01:28:48,331 --> 01:28:52,734
You guys, listen. l do want to tell
you that l've decided to quit acting.

1387
01:28:53,436 --> 01:28:56,633
My character gets killed
in some random violence...

1388
01:28:56,839 --> 01:28:58,898
...while drinking a decaf cappuccino.

1389
01:28:59,742 --> 01:29:01,437
That's so sad!

1390
01:29:02,078 --> 01:29:03,409
And so l quit.

1391
01:29:04,113 --> 01:29:06,308
l'm sad for you. This is sad.

1392
01:29:06,549 --> 01:29:07,675
This bird is done.

1393
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:09,283
You were good.

1394
01:29:09,919 --> 01:29:12,251
You were great, l'm sure.
Please open the door.

1395
01:29:12,455 --> 01:29:14,184
ls the oven preheated?

1396
01:29:18,628 --> 01:29:21,529
-ls it heavy?
-Yes! Could you help me?

1397
01:29:21,731 --> 01:29:22,993
lt is really heavy.

1398
01:29:23,866 --> 01:29:25,959
You're strong. lt's in!

1399
01:29:26,669 --> 01:29:29,604
You did it! All right!

1400
01:29:31,607 --> 01:29:33,302
Let's go sit with the bullet!

1401
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:36,041
Do you wanna sit with the bullet?

1402
01:29:36,312 --> 01:29:38,109
-Thanks for helping!
-You're welcome.

1403
01:29:38,314 --> 01:29:40,612
You know what?
You're a little bit shiny!

1404
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:42,881
This is Donna Karan!

1405
01:29:43,085 --> 01:29:45,679
Good God! That's Donna Karan!

1406
01:29:46,322 --> 01:29:47,914
No, wait a minute!

1407
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:50,825
You can't stop me!

1408
01:29:54,263 --> 01:29:56,424
lt's in your mouth.

1409
01:30:59,495 --> 01:31:02,396
No, Maddy. Eve, help me!

1410
01:31:11,574 --> 01:31:13,974
l have a Donna Karan dress....

1411
01:31:14,677 --> 01:31:16,042
Wait a minute!
