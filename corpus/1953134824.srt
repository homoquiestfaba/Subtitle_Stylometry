00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,327
<i>The Vampire and Lycan...</i>

2
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,561
<i>...clans had been at war...</i>

3
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,330
<i>...for centuries before I was born...</i>

4
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:49,883
<i>...their conflict...</i>

5
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,729
<i>...hidden from...</i>

6
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,569
<i>the human world.</i>

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,328
<i>I was turned...</i>

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,367
<i>...by a Vampire.</i>

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,649
<i>Given the strength...</i>

10
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,449
<i>...to avenge...</i>

11
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,249
<i>...my family...</i>

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,083
<i>...against the Lycans.</i>

13
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,886
<i>And I was good at it.</i>

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,289
<i>Then I found Michael Corvin...</i>

15
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,322
<i>...a human that was...</i>

16
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,891
<i>...turned to neither Vampire...</i>

17
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,723
<i>...nor Lycan...</i>

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,049
<i>...but a hybrid...</i>

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,361
<i>...of the two.</i>

20
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,442
<i>Everything changed.</i>

21
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,522
<i>Allies turned...</i>

22
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,488
<i>...enemies...</i>

23
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,285
<i>...and the Vampire elders I had...</i>

24
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,169
<i>...protected for over six centuries...</i>

25
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,729
<i>...wanted me dead.</i>

26
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,200
<i>We retaliated...</i>

27
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,401
<i>...killed the elders...</i>

28
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,682
<i>...and for a moment of time...</i>

29
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,442
<i>...we were safe.</i>

30
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,848
<i>But then...</i>

31
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,849
<i>...a new darkness arose.</i>

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,728
<i>In the nine days...</i>

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,526
<i>...since the first discovery
of the non-human species...</i>

34
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,648
<i>...scores of so-called “covens“
have been uncovered.</i>

35
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,081
<i>Estimates of the number
of infected have skyrocketed.</i>

36
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,247
<i>Military sources confirm...</i>

37
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,843
<i>...that the primary measures...</i>

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,321
<i>...of defence
against the non-humans are...</i>

39
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,130
<i>...ultraviolet light and silver...</i>

40
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,090
<i>...to which the infected
appear to have fatal sensitivity.</i>

41
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,200
<i>Tents are posted at every
barricade throughout the city.</i>

42
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,601
<i>A test will be administered...</i>

43
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,409
<i>...to verify...</i>

44
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,971
<i>...if you're clear of infection.</i>

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,526
Spray her!

46
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,488
Spray her with silver!

47
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,008
- Get it out here!
- Help! Run!

48
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,928
No, no! Run!

49
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,330
<i>We've begun our second
attack wave...</i>

50
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,601
<i>...using ultraviolet...</i>

51
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,568
<i>...and silver-nitrate...</i>

52
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,881
<i>...munitions, which are...</i>

53
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,201
<i>...deadly to the infected.</i>

54
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,441
<i>Due to the volatile...</i>

55
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,362
<i>...situation...</i>

56
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,364
<i>...martial law was declared
two hours ago.</i>

57
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,242
<i>Many of us have...</i>

58
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,004
<i>...lost loved ones to this.</i>

59
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,881
<i>Please know that you cannot
help them or yourself.</i>

60
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,048
<i>It's shocking...</i>

61
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,008
<i>...that not one...</i>

62
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,047
<i>...but two distinct...</i>

63
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,044
<i>...species may have been
coexisting within human populations.</i>

64
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,128
The existence
of Vampires and Werewolves...

65
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,682
<i>...now appear to have
actual basis in fact.</i>

66
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,243
<i>The city remains reluctant
to share new...</i>

67
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,162
<i>information.</i>

68
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,484
<i>We are getting reports on what
appears to be a mass cleansing.</i>

69
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,687
Fire!

70
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,521
Get back! No cameras!

71
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,124
<i>There's no cure.</i>

72
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,286
There it is!

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,728
Engage contact!

74
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,969
Man down!

75
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,246
- Man down!
- Cover me!

76
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,566
<i>The Purge.</i>

77
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,884
<i>Human beings no longer
kill each other.</i>

78
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,725
We are the enemy
they've been waiting for.

79
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,243
<i>Escape has become
our only chance of survival.</i>

80
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,283
<i>Therefore...</i>

81
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,727
<i>...Michael and I are leaving tonight.</i>

82
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,529
Halt!

83
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,682
<i>Delta 6 in pursuit!</i>

84
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,769
Stop! Get down on the ground!

85
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,801
She'll be here any minute.

86
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,564
- You be ready to go.
- Better hurry.

87
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,808
<i>Tango Unit moving into position.</i>

88
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,646
<i>We have the hybrid in sight.</i>

89
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,768
<i>Hold your fire. Leave this one alive.</i>

90
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,811
<i>Delta in position.</i>

91
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,882
<i>- Watch your flank.
- Secure.</i>

92
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,802
Move, move, move!

93
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,043
<i>Alpha Unit in position.</i>

94
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,241
<i>Arming silver grenade!</i>

95
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,122
Michael!

96
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,487
<i>Fire!</i>

97
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,160
<i>- Move in!
- Alpha 4, move in.</i>

98
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,725
<i>Grenades, fire!</i>

99
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,370
Retrieve the bodies.

100
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,766
<i>Subject 2 has escaped.

101

Look out!

114

<i>Defrost sequence...</i>

115

<i>...complete.</i>

116
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,648
- Subject 2! Get it!
- Over there...

117
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,962
...by the chamber!
Don't let it get away!

118

<i>Security violation, Level 6.</i>

119

120
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,607
Jacob.

121
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,683
Subject 2 escaped,
it's in the building.

122
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,642
We've got Subject 1
in full lockdown.

123
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,847
- Give me the status.
- Subject 1 has broken free.

124
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,322
- We need to flash-burn immediately.
- No, wait. Let me see.

125
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,246
Open it.

126
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,248
Put it back to sleep.

127
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,761
Hurry.

128
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,127
<i>Releasing...</i>

129
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,123
<i>...maximum dose of fentanyl.</i>

130
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,565
What is this place?

131
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,128
Where's Michael?

132
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,646
No, no, no. No, no, no.

133
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,843
All non-security personnel...

134
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,126
...clear the building!

135
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,089
Security command, outside now!

136
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,729
- There she is!
- Stop!

137
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,166
Don't move!

138
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,605
Multiple casualties on Level 6!
Medical to alert status!

139
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,602
Prepare for full...

I see her.

144
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,848
East corridor. Send security.

145
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,001
<i>No. Let her go.</i>

146
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,922
<i>She'll lead us...</i>

147
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,842
<i>...to Subject 2.</i>

148
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,001
No, don't shoot!

149
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,809
Let her go.

150
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,731
<i>Subject 1 and Subject 2

151

<i>...and are no longer

152
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,207
<i>Secure the outer gates and use
extreme caution upon encounter.</i>

153
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,603
<i>Report immediately upon

154
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,609
Hey, how did you get in there?

155
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,929
You're not allowed in here.

156
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,125
The pier is closed.

157
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,960
Since when?

158
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,171
A long time ago. Come on.

159
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,282
How long?

160
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,449
About 12 years ago.

161
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,885
Since the cleansing. Why?

162
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,686
You okay, ma'am?

163
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,604
<i>Attention, all units, code three call.</i>

164
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,445
<i>Receiving a report of an assault,
Exit 39 underpass.</i>

165

167
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,688
Ma'am? Hey!

168
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,961
Ma
.am?

169
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,562
- What are you doing?
- Stay there! Don't move!

170
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,802
- Identify yourself!
- Get back here right now!

171
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,680
Whoever it is,
they couldn't have made it very far.

172
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,365
I'll alert CDC to keep an eye out.

173
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,607
They're en route.

174
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,650
- There's no way this attack was human.
- You don't know that.

175
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,290
Don't know what?

176
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,170
The guy's shredded.
His throat was...

177
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,243
-...in the gutter.
- Just let me handle it.

178
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,801
What's to handle?
This has Lycan written all over it.

179
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,609
Detective...

180
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,128
...when was the last time you heard
about a reported Lycan killing?

181
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,207
A couple years ago.

182
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,601
How many years
have you been with this department?

183
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,010
What? I've been here
for three months.

184
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,491
Exactly.

185
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,961
You question me less
until you know a bit more.

186
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,282
- We clear?
- Crystal.

187
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,851
Detective Sebastian.

188
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,923
Detective, we've just
received <i>a</i> report.

189
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,730
<i>A witness says
there was an escape.</i>

190
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,370
<i>They said someone jumped...</i>

191
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,602
<i>...out of a window.
This is a priority...</i>

192
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,727
<i>investigation.</i>

193
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,325
We need you over there <i>ASAP.</i>

194
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,925
We're on our way.

195
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,242
Hey, let's go.
Johnson, you're the lead.

196
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,084
You got it, detective. Will do.

197
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,171
Who's in charge?

198
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,800
There's a Detective Sebastian
here to see you, sir.

199
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,290
Where is he?

200
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,408
In the lobby, sir.

201
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,291
<i>You'll be relieved to know...</i>

202
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,204
...the situation is well under control.

203
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,601
- What happened?
- I repeat, well under control.

204
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,364
I repeat, what happened?

205
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,049
Yes, there are reports to be filed.

206
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,129
One of our test subjects attempted to
escape. We were forced to put it down.

207
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,760
- So nothing got out?
- Only a stray bullet.

208
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,491
- And the test subject?
- Flash-burned.

209
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,647
Will that be all?

210
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,487
A few things to attend to.
You could imagine.

211
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,763
Doctor, we received
an anonymous call...

212
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,161
...that something else
escaped through a window.

213
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,961
Detective, our mission at Antigen
is to develop ways of preventing...

214
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,761
...infection, not releasing it
into the general population.

215
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,880
I lost my son to this disease.

216
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,283
There's no room for error with me
when it comes to the safety of...

217
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,681
...the public.
If something had escaped...

218
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,888
...the authorities
would have been notified.

219
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,610
You are an authority, are you not?

220
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,163
Now, if you'll excuse me...

221
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,083
The guy in charge says it's nothing.
Let's go.

222
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,971
Yeah, and he's full of shit.
Look at this.

223
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,846
Want me to report it, sir?

224
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,530
No. I'll do it.

225
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,762
I don't mind. I can do it for you.

226
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,520
All right, sir.

227
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,091
The prisoner that helped me escape,
the one you called Subject 2...

228
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,327
...was it a hybrid?

229
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,681
Yes.

230
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,330
What were you doing with us?

231
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,326
We...

232
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,765
We help the government
identify the infected.

233
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,486
We were using your DNA
to try to find a cure...

234
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,847
...to prevent another outbreak.

235
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,525
You were told that I would...

236
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,409
...lead you to the hybrid. Why?

237
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,806
Subject 2 is restricted information.

238
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,530
I don't have the clearance.

239
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,564
You're lying.

240
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,891
No!

241
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,531
No, please!

242
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,488
All I know is...

243
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,130
...there's a connection between you.

244
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,727
Your brain waves...

245
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,609
...fall into sync
when you're close...

246
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,602
...to each other.

247
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,966
You can see through
each other's eyes!

248
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,047
Please don't!

249
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,645
I'm the one who let you go!

250
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,605
Now we're even.

251
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,684
What the hell was that?

252
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,970
Creepy is what.

253
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,804
- I'm calling it in.
- Let's go.

254
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,569
Shit.

255
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,402
Don't.

256
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,607
Why not?

257
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,445
We're the same.

258
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,245
Why are you following me?

259
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,050
We monitor the police frequencies.

260
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,687
"We"?

261
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,525
Do you know what attacked
that human under the bridge?

262
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,560
No.

263
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,206
Lycans.

264
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,521
What remains of them, yes.

265
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,003
They've been hiding
down here like rats...

266
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,047
...since the Purge.

267
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,329
Diseased and starving, they rarely
show themselves above ground.

268
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,126
Which means that something
has got them riled up.

269
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,250
Something you're not telling me.

270
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,208
Michael!

271
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,049
Do you know her?

272
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,406
No.

273
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,250
They will come back in numbers.

274
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,364
We can't leave her here.

275
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,048
Come on.

276
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,120
Let's try the van.

277
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,969
Get in. Move! Move!

278
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,411
Three of them behind us.

279
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,129
Go!

280
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,403
Hurry, Selene!

281
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,686
They're getting in the back!

282
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,084
Fucking piece of shit!

283
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,691
The girl! They're taking her!

284
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,005
You drive.

285
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,364
She's not healing.

286
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,841
We have a doctor that can help her
at our coven.

287
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,963
How did you...

288
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,281
...find me?

289
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,170
Subject 2.

290
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,005
And you are Subject 1.

291
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,888
If reed you.

292
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,048
Do you not know who I am?

293
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,085
They told me that I had no mother...

294
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,368
...that she died when I was born.

295
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,848
I never believed it. I...

296
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,448
I felt you.

297
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,762
Saw images through your eyes.

298
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,846
But then someone outside my door...

299
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,970
...they said since I was no longer
a child, the wait was over...

300
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,125
...that I'd be dead soon.

301
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,525
And that my own mother,
right next door...

302
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,606
...would never even know I'd existed.

303
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,562
What did they tell you of your father?

304
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,284
They must have told you something.

305
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,408
Do you see images through him?

306
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,046
No.

307
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,731
Only you.

308
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,327
No, please!

309
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,928
<i>She's never stepped foot
outside the lab.</i>

310
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,525
How can she possibly survive?

311
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,570
I understand the risk of reporting
her escape to the authorities.

312
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,801
No record of her birth.

313
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,201
Questions will be asked.
I'm well aware of that.

314
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,362
But if she dies,
all our years of research--

315
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,090
Rather than tell me
how to do my job...

316
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,130
...why not take a look
at your own professional conduct?

317
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,851
And how your continual need
to endow this creature...

318
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,846
...with human traits has led to
the laxness of its security protocols.

319
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,571
It's not a human being, Lida!
It's not your child.

320
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,846
It's not to be coddled.

321
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,923
It's a blight of nature.

322
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,642
Stop worrying. It'll come back to us.

323
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,124
Get Olivia at once.

324
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,291
Again you break my rules. Why?

325
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,488
She was attacked.

326
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,007
She is not healing.

327
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,481
And for this
you compromise our safety?

328
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,368
You have...

329
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,568
...no reason to fear us.

330
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,370
Do you think I'm foolish enough
to take you at your word?

331
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,642
No reason...

332
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,485
...to fear a Death Dealer
who fell in love with a Lycan...

333
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,608
...who murdered two of our elders...

334
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,002
...and who, at every turn,
has betrayed...

335
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,400
...her own kind.

336
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,125
Do you know who this is?

337
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,849
Yes.

338
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,528
But it was we
who betrayed her, Father.

339
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,446
Let her through.

340
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,171
She's not healing.

341
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,602
She was attacked by a lower Lycan.

342
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,407
Two hours ago.

343
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,764
Her cell repair is...

344
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,130
...active but weakened.

345
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,967
She has no...

346
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,644
...origin bite marks...

347
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,170
...or scars.

348
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,967
I've never seen a child like this before.

349
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,642
When did you last feed?

350
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,240
Feed?

351
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,085
Give her blood.

352
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,202
Child...

353
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,691
...you must.

354
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,240
Slowly.

355
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,331
Slowly.

356
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,007
There.

357
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,724
There, now.

358
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,250
She's healing.

359
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,002
- And quickly.
- Good.

360
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,924
Take her to my room.
She needs to rest.

361
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,047
No.

362
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,606
Look at the eyes.

363
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,482
I never believed it.

364
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,405
They do exist.

365
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,007
This is not one of us.

366
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,481
No, it's something more, Father.

367
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,883
What do you know of her?

368
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,125
I was held captive
at a place called Antigen.

369
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,802
One of the other prisoners freed me.

370
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,124
I believed it was Michael Corvin...

371
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,681
...the only hybrid I knew
existed at that time.

372
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,808
Yes, yes, your Lycan lover, long dead.

373
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,564
What is this, then?

374
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,770
None of your concern.

375
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,125
As soon as she regains her strength,
I will leave with her.

376
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,041
I used to hear stories...

377
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,486
...of the Death Dealers.

378
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,122
That they were a thing of the past...

379
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,089
...never to return.

380
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,209
I'm glad they were wrong.

381
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,564
You knew who I am...

382
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,562
...and yet you still brought me here.

383
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,370
Thank you.

384
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,249
You're a fighter.

385
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,001
We could use more like you
to teach us.

386
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,888
I'm not sure...

387
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,405
...your father would agree.

388
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,121
There was a time when he would have.
That's why he dislikes you so much.

389
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,365
I think it reminds him of the days when
he defended us with fire and steel...

390
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,922
...rather than hollow words.
He knows how much we need you.

391
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,290
- I'm not a leader.
- But you fight for what you believe in.

392
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,366
You always have.

393
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,362
I don't know...

394
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,851
...what I believe in anymore.

395
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,446
I don't recognise this world.

396
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,409
But you haven't changed.

397
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,441
I saw it in your eyes
when you looked at the child.

398
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,721
You will protect her.

399
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,120
It's in your blood.

400
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,805
It's who you are.

401
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,687
When you leave, take me with you.

402
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,323
You distrust me.

403
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,643
Of course you do.
I made you feel unwelcome.

404
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,802
And for that, I'm sorry.

405
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,044
Those eyes...

406
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,524
...they're special.

407
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,687
I know exactly what you are.

408
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,486
<i>My father says that...</i>

409
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,928
...should we survive as a species,
these relics will help...

410
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,526
...our descendants know
who we were and how we lived.

411
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,250
And what do you say?

412
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,687
That if we continue to live
as we do now...

413
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,571
...then we disgrace the past
and don't deserve a future.

414
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,961
We must resist the humans...

415
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,489
...wherever and whenever possible.

416
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,722
Between the first and second Purges...

417
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,883
...Lycan youth rallied in the same way
against the prudence of their elders.

418
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,442
Their calls for violent action
carried the day.

419
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,045
The result?

420
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,971
The Werewolves are nearly extinct.

421
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,690
Is that what you wish for us,
extinction?

422
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,361
Yet you bring...

423
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,727
...her offspring into our home.
Do you honestly...

424
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,724
...believe the humans
will allow her to remain free?

425
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,883
They will hunt her down
at any expense.

426
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,850
- Then we can help protect them.
- Protect them?

427
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,130
They leave tonight.

428
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,089
This isn't...

429
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:13,889
...prudence.

430
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,849
This is cowardice, plain and simple.

431
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,569
How dare you?

432
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,884
How dare you...

433
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,126
...do so little?

434
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,407
I dreamt of the day we would meet.

435
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,367
Like a silly little girl.

436
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,125
You're as cold as one already dead.

437
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,970
Yesterday...

438
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,642
...I was with your father.

439
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,842
He was only a little further away
from me than you are now.

440
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,730
I went to sleep.

441
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,562
And when I awoke the next day...

442
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,729
...I learned that, overnight...

443
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,008
...12 years had passed.

444
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,644
And instead of the only man
I've ever loved...

445
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,321
...there stood a girl with his eyes.

446
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,927
My heart is not cold.

447
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,684
It's broken.

448
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,290
I'm so sorry.

449
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,486
What is it?

450
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,647
They're here.

451
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,047
Stay here. Wait for me.

452
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,611
No, take me with you.

453
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,886
Please.

454
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,249
I won't let anyone hurt you. I promise.

455
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,401
Lock the door.

456
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,322
Everybody to the shelter. Now!

457
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,121
No!

458
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,169
Prepare the armoury.

459
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,322
Do as I say! Go, go!

460
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,601
Pay heed to me!

461
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,809
No! We stand and we fight.

462
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,401
No! Have you no sense?

463
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,367
Stop this now!

464
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,690
We lived safely for years
and you brought humans into this coven.

465
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,967
They want the girl.

466
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,724
They'll stop at nothing
to get her.

467
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,645
This day was bound to come,
with or without us.

468
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,280
Let's move!
Munitions, let's go! Everyone!

469
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,646
Are you mad?

470
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,963
We have no more than a handful
of fighters. We will be annihilated!

471
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,291
And what's your plan, Father?

472
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,965
Let's go! Now!

473
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,966
- Where are you going?
- To get her away from here.

474
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,726
- He's right. I shouldn't have come.
- He doesn't understand.

475
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,326
The humans will follow us out.
Hold them off till then.

476
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,646
They're only here for her.

477
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,524
She's more powerful than any of us.

478
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,284
They fear the day she discovers it.

479
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,050
I have to get her out of here.

480
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,050
Lycan!

481
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,251
Silver ammunition!

482
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,208
Now!

483
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,522
Defend the second...

484
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,329
...rotunda!

485
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,720
Move! Move!

486
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,531
Open the door!

487
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,248
Let's go.

488
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,520
Move! Move!

489
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,486
We need to go.

490
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,166
What the hell was that?

491
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,608
- Take her somewhere safe.
- No.

492
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,171
Take her. Go.

493
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,885
Where is she?

494
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,765
They took her.

495
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,484
They accepted her.

496
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,122
As a gift from me.

497
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,526
Do you know what you've done?

498
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,001
Do you have any idea?

499
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,322
What would you have had me do?

500
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,605
Fight to the last to protect
the very one who brought this upon us?

501
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,082
We're defeated.

502
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,008
Our coven is destroyed.
My son...

503
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:36,968
...is dead.

504
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,970
Because of you.

505
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,126
Why?

506
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,920
Because he helped that...

507
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,650
...child of yours.

508
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,802
If they kill her, so be it.

509
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,169
Your son died because
he was fighting for all of you.

510
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,842
Because he knew that running
is not survival.

511
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,165
Those were Lycans.

512
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,290
Not extinct. More powerful than ever.

513
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,450
That thing was more than twice the size
of any Lycan I've seen.

514
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,002
They risked...

515
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,131
...showing themselves after more than
a decade in hiding because of her.

516
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,487
And you handed her over to them.

517
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,287
She is the last...

518
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:20,286
...direct descendant
of Alexander Corvinus.

519
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,009
The only hybrid child
that has ever existed.

520
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,681
Whatever it is the Lycans
want from her...

521
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,921
...your son knew it was
worth dying for.

522
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,840
What are you doing?

523
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,406
David.

524
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,090
A force of two dozen Lycans...

525
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,289
...attacked and destroyed
one of our covens last night.

526
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,400
You're not surprised.

527
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,284
You knew the Lycans
were not extinct.

528
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,043
- How?
- Just a feeling.

529
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,403
I'm not good with feelings.

530
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,324
I want to know how.

531
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,642
This is not the place for this.

532
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,805
And you're not gonna kill me.

533
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:44,927
Really?

534
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,161
No.

535
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,527
Because you wouldn't need
a fucking gun to do it.

536
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,207
<i>A few years ago...</i>

537
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,170
...the government declared
"mission accomplished" on Lycans.

538
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,482
The feds announced that
we were to only focus...

539
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,244
...on your kind now.

540
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,571
Three months ago,
a friend of mine sent me this.

541
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,282
It arrived two days after he was found
hanging from his own ceiling fan.

542
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,768
Two hundred suspected
Lycan captures.

543
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,410
Every case was investigated.

544
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,642
Every blood test came back negative.

545
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,040
My friend began to wonder:

546
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,522
Were they all false leads or was
someone trying to protect the Lycans?

547
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,126
Helping them replenish their packs,
letting them regroup.

548
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,209
What about your own department?

549
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,282
They have my daughter.
All I care about is getting her back.

550
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,164
If you're protecting someone, I don't
care. I'm not after them. I just want her.

551
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,686
No.

552
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:44,366
Even if there are others in my
department, they don't have authority.

553
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,170
This goes much higher.

554
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,042
I believe, all the way to the top.

555
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,482
Or to the bottom.

556
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,241
What do you mean?

557
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,328
Who administers the tests?

558
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,402
We're a bit short on time,
so if you please, take a look at these.

559
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,641
This schedule takes you
from the moment we adjourn...

560
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,121
...through to the final manufacture
of the vaccine.

561
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:11,325
If we stick to this plan, inoculations
should begin within three months.

562
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,244
Any questions, now's the time.

563
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,529
After today's surgery, there will be
no communication between us...

564
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,842
...until we meet again
in the inoculation centre.

565
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,405
Doctor, in terms...

566
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,846
...of your test subject...

567
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,606
...he continues to demonstrate
immunity to silver?

568
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,046
Absolutely.

569
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:30,445
And additional inoculations,
administered only as a precaution...

570
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,602
...triggered side effects
we never imagined.

571
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,041
Vast increases...

572
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,362
...in strength, muscle mass...

573
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,124
...self-healing...

574
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,401
...stamina.

575
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,766
You said she was essential
to our research.

576
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,881
- Yes, and will continue to be.
- How?

577
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,165
By vivisecting her?

578
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,245
You weren't meant to have that.

579
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,970
I cared for this little girl...

580
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,649
...all these years,
and you expect me to sit by...

581
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,521
-...while you--
- Harvest its genetic material?

582
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,850
I expect nothing from you.

583
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,444
I hired you to look after it...

584
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,809
...and for the most part,
you did an excellent job.

585
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,048
Saving the lives of thousands.

586
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,963
What are you talking about?

587
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,487
An entire species
saved from extinction.

588
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,326
Jacob.

589
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,246
After today, you won't have to
wait so long between injections.

590
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,808
Are you sure she's ready?

591
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,644
Oestrogen levels high...

592
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,770
...intervals between menses
holding steady.

593
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,849
It's come of age.

594
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:22,803
Everything's worked out
just as we'd hoped.

595
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,483
You're the first proof of it.

596
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,924
I'm proud of you, son.

597
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,209
Now that it's with us again...

598
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,409
...we'll have all the genetic material
we need, ready for cloning.

599
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,928
Enough to produce
an endless supply of vaccine.

600
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:46,882
Imagine.

601
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,171
Our species immune to silver.

602
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,924
No more hiding.

603
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:55,402
Every Lycan under our command
as powerful as you are.

604
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,680
I've even begun injecting myself.

605
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,800
I only wish Mother
were here to see it.

606
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,887
Your mother chose to
remain human.

607
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,568
She abandoned us.

608
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,404
Remember that.

609
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,405
Of course, Father.

610
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,009
Look...

611
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:39,085
...if you're right about Antigen, who
knows how many Lycans will be there?

612
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,046
The second you step foot inside,
you'll be surrounded.

613
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,247
I'm hoping so.

614
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,848
I know you want her back.
I can help you.

615
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,526
- Why?
- Just tell me what your plan is.

616
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,128
It's worse if you try to fight it.

617
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,446
Trust me.

618
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,365
So how is it you're actually...

619
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,841
...able to survive in the sunlight?

620
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,250
It was a gift.

621
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,168
From a man named
Alexander Corvinus.

622
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,451
The founding father.

623
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,641
I used to be married, to a nurse.

624
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,209
One day at work, she was bitten.

625
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,926
Nobody knew but us.
We lived like that for a few years.

626
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,604
Then came the Purge.

627
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,607
The feds were conducting door-to-doors
and when they knocked on ours...

628
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,691
...well, she told me she loved me...

629
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,642
...and then she let the sunlight in.

630
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,843
I had to watch her burn.

631
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,041
Okay.

632
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,805
You got me?

633
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,640
Yes.

634
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,011
Good luck.

635
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,480
- Shit. It's her.
- In daylight?

636
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,289
It's her!

637
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,327
- Go!
- Okay

638
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,322
Wait for my cue.

639
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,242
I'm ready.

640
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,409
Ops Code A. Repeat, Ops Code A.
Breach on Level 1.

641
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,324
Intruder ascending in Elevator 4.

642
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,642
<i>I want all levels ready
on that elevator now!</i>

643
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,484
- Anaesthesia ready?
- Yes, sir.

644
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,482
Good.

645
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,565
<i>Security units on alert.</i>

646
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,439
<i>Ops Code A.
Intruder on premises.</i>

647
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:19,479


648
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:22,006
<i>Secure the east wing.
All units, intruder's ascending...</i>

649
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,002
<i>...in the elevator.</i>

650
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,491
Come on.

651
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,121
Let's go.

652
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:45,323
Move!

653
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,370
<i>There's your cue.</i>

654
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,601
COPY-

655
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,123
They're using silver-nitrate gas.
Bombs on all the floors.

656
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:40,243
It's Subject 1. We need to evacuate.

657
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,721
Fine.

658
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:42,688
Start a propofol...

659
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:43,568
...infusion.

660
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:47,611
We're not cancelling this procedure,
understood? We're moving it.

661
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,245
You find her...

662
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,404
...and you destroy her.

663
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,005
With pleasure.

664
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:07,809
I'm here.

665
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,371
I got movement on a van in...

666
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,362
...Parking Level 3.

667
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:11,965
<i>No sign of the girl.</i>

668
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:15,329
They'll be on the move.
Just don't lose them.

669
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,361
She's in the service elevator.

670
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,002
Get her.

671
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,087
I'm coming down.

672
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,651
Selene. Selene!

673
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,967
They're heading for Parking Level 2.

674
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,646
Selene.

675
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:57,722
<i>I need to know...</i>

676
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:58,608
<i>...where you are!</i>

677
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:09,889
Shit!

678
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,401
<i>Do you COPY?</i>

679
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:26,971
Selene, where are you?

680
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,247
I see her. I see her.

681
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:58,762
Parking Level 2.

682
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,081
They're loading her...

683
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,401
into the van.

684
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,125
Selene, where are you?

685
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,806
Fuck it.

686
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:13,044
Hold it right there! Stop! Stop now!

687
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:26,527
Get her!

688
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:27,602
Take her out!

689
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,085
<i>Selene, Lane has her...</i>

690
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,720
<i>...in the van.
They're on the move. Where are you?</i>

691
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,723
<i>They are leaving with her!
Do you hear me?</i>

692
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,126
I.m 0 n m <i>Y</i> way

693
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,246
Come on, faster.

694
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,248
Don't stop.

695
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,049
Hit him!

696
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,448
Selene, they're heading
for Parking Level 1.

697
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,644
Selene, they're getting <i>away</i>
on Parking Level 1. Do you copy?

698
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,445
I'm coming.

699
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:31,487
Everything okay?

700
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:32,448
Levels are...

701
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,523
...holding stable, sir. Baseline vitals--

702
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:13,527
Fuck you.

703
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,007
Get away from her!

704
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,882
It's worse if you try to fight it.

705
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,291
Trust me.

706
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:55,171
I heal instantly.

707
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,447
I'm counting on it.

708
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,883
You came back for me.

709
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,770
I said I would.

710
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,125
Selene.

711
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:07,965
You should go.

712
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,403
There's a safe house
not far from here.

713
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:13,527
Go. I'll send them...

714
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:16,251
...on a different path,
buy you some time.

715
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,208
Thank you. Come on.

716
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:20,771
David.

717
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,764
Are we going back in?

718
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,206
We are.

719
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:44,241
What is it?

720
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:46,528
Michael?

721
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,846
The roof.

722
01:14:55,800 --> 01:15:00,010
<i>Though the world has changed,
our enemy remains the same.</i>

723

<i>The Lycans...</i>

724
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:02,847
<i>...will rebuild.</i>

725
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,002
<i>And will hunt for her father
as they did...</i>

726
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:05,922
<i>...for her.</i>

727
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,045
<i>But as they grow stronger...</i>

728
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:11,965
<i>...so will we.</i>

729
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,490
<i>The Vampire coven will not only...</i>

730
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,290
<i>...survive this world...</i>

731
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,763
<i>...we will reclaim it.</i>
