00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:05,704
           Brian: Hi.           

2
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:09,274
 The question I get asked,      
 more than any other by far is, 

3
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:12,644
      what's it like to         
      work with So-and-So.      

4
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:15,614
     The answers are            
     often interchangeable      
     general compliments        

5
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,483
       that give little,        
       if any information       

6
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:20,085
  about the actual experience.  

7
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:24,590
 What is it really like to      
 work with Sylvester Stallone?  

8
00:00:24,592 --> 00:00:26,325
     Arnold Schwarzenegger?     

9
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:28,227
         Steven Segal?          

10
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:32,297
       What is it like          
       to work with JCVD?       

11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:36,468
    The title for this movie    
    could have been WILT WW.    

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,406
 What's it like to work with... 

13
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,475
       This movie isn't         
       going to tell you.       

14
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:46,745
  It's going to show you my     
  impression of what it's like  

15
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:49,381
to be on the set with So-and-So.

16
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,617
    We've combined traits of    
    these action stars and      

17
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:55,354
     a few others into one      
     fictional character.       

18
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:58,090
 The great Vardell Duseldorfer. 

19
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:01,560
His friends simply call him VD. 

20
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,463
  Much of what you're about to  
  see, I actually witnessed.    

21
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:07,099
   And as they say on TV, the   
   names have been changed      

22
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:09,802
  so the guilty won't sue you.  

23
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:15,541
  And so, to my aforementioned  
  muses, thank you.             

24
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:21,547
 Now, let's find out what it's  
 like to work with So-and-So.   

25
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,885
       (80s-style hard          
       rock guitar music)       

26
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,285
   (applause from television)   

27
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:35,387
       Tara: Welcome to         
       Excess Hollywood!        

28
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,956
       Studio singers:          
       ¶Excess Hollywood        

29
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,925
Tara: Lots of dirt, no cleanup! 

30
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:41,660
           (laughter)           

31
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,562
Tara: I'm your host, Tara Grey. 

32
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:43,562
    (applause and cheering)     

33
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:49,568
 Tara: On the comeback trail,   
 the great Vardell Duseldorfer. 

34
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,671
    (applause and cheering)     

35
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,341
Tara: His adoring fans who often

36
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,645
      contract his              
      uberlong name to VD,      

37
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,480
 some things defy explanation.  

38
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:04,716
   But one thing is for sure,   
   his fans do love him.        

39
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,885
    First VD fan: I love VD.    

40
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,821
   Second VD fan: I've been     
   a fan of VD for 17 years.    

41
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,924
   Third VD fan: Keep it        
   comin', stay off the hook,   

42
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:14,459
   stay hot with the people,    
   this how we do it!           

43
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:17,629
     Fourth VD fan: To          
     have VD is to love VD.     

44
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:20,199
I've been a VD fan for 52 years.

45
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:21,433
           (laughter)           

46
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:23,669
    Ralek: You can say what     
    you want about Vardell,     

47
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:26,738
     but he got where he is     
     because of one reason.     

48
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,407
       He's the great VD.       

49
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,909
 Redheaded child: My momma      
 told me that VD was a disease. 

50
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:35,581
    Video guy: Duseldorfer,     
    number, number one!         

51
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,915
           (laughter)           

52
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,685
   Tara: The embarrassed        
   ubernatorial has wandered    

53
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,987
once again in front of a camera.

54
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,724
   Uzbekistan apparently        
   wishes to play host to VD,   

55
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,893
and welcomes him with open arms,

56
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:51,029
if not a nice, warm petri dish. 

57
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,466
       (toilet flushing)        

58
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,868
      Tara: What might          
      the Uzbekis expect?       

59
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,637
Well, let's hear from some stars

60
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,906
      who've had some           
      experience with VD.       

61
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,641
           Mr. Kove?            

62
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,476
 Martin: I don't kiss and tell. 

63
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:07,479
  Especially when it involves   
  something as personal as VD.  

64
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:08,780
           (laughter)           

65
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:11,316
    Tara: I know, how           
    about a Herculean quote     

66
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,652
 from Mr. Kevin Sorbo himself.  

67
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:18,023
Kevin: Working and Duseldorfer. 

68
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,928
   It's kind of an oxymoron.    

69
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,764
 Or a moron disguised as an ox. 

70
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,466
 No, don't, don't use that one. 

71
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:28,634
      I got a better one.       
      (laughter)                

72
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:30,969
   Working with Duseldorfer.    

73
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:34,039
      It was sort of like       
      juggling water.           

74
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,974
      You never really get      
      the balls in the air      

75
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:39,478
      and you have to           
      clean up afterwards.      

76
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,747
   VD: Oh, nice shot, Kevin.    

77
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,449
       Tara: Who would          
       have thought that        

78
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,985
    the former bodybuilder's    
    small... (laughter)         

79
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:51,890
  Time in office would be       
  punctuated a maid escapade.   

80
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:54,293
 Tara: (imitating Duseldorfer)  
 I was just trying to show her  

81
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:58,397
 how to work off the large fold 
 of fat the tummy bellyflap.    

82
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,799
    And it just slipped in!     

83
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,436
     Yeah it was accident!      

84
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:07,773
   And poof, it made a baby!    

85
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:10,375
            (buzzer)            

86
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,444
    Vardell: Fuck you, Tara.    

87
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:14,446
      Tara: We can support      
      his support of moms,      

88
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,315
   and public breastfeeding.    

89
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:17,783
   Tara: (imitating Vardell)    
   More public breastfeeding!   

90
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:20,052
   More public breastfeeding!   

91
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:23,722
    Tara: But what about his    
    bill to get goldfish,       

92
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:27,492
     yes, uh-huh, goldfish      
     in every home?             

93
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,428
   Vardell: Not the goldfish!   

94
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,896
   Tara: (imitating Vardell)    
   Goldfish propagation         

95
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:35,000
 reduces the greenhouse gases   
 and helps the children relax!  

96
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,369
            (buzzer)            

97
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:39,404
       Vardell: You made        
       goldfish dirty.          

98
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,139
   Tara: The movie that         
   made him go into politics    

99
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:44,543
   in the first place was       
   that Fascist Time Machine    

100
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:47,612
   wreck that detonated more    
   than his fragile career.     

101
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,648
        (bomb exploding)        
        (laughter)              

102
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,717
     Vardell: That was          
     the director's fault!      

103
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:55,153
    Tara: So can dysfunction    
    be dysfunctional?           

104
00:05:55,155 --> 00:06:00,158
   Has the expendable actor,    
   yes, expendable actor        

105
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,661
  passed his expiration date?   

106
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:04,496
       It's not looking         
       good for our hero.       

107
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,465
 Possible movie trailer voice.  

108
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:08,033
           Thank you.           

109
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:11,803
Will our hero make it out alive?

110
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,741
  (determined, dramatic music)  

111
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:19,411
    VD: Oooo, you think it's    
    easy to make a movie?       

112
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,913
      You sit there in          
      your thong and your       

113
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:24,583
       air conditioner          
       and you judge me!        

114
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,518
      I'd like to see you       
      crawl through mud.        

115
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,888
  Sweat, work 20 hours a day.   

116
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,792
     I tell you, Hard Time      
     on Mars will make more     

117
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,894
  money than you can count to!  

118
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,629
          I show you!           

119
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:40,065
         I show you!!!          

120
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,407
          I show you.           

121
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,710
           (gunshot)            

122
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:56,715
       I did not retire,        
       I got extension.         

123
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,859
         (VD groaning)          

124
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:13,231
      (breathing heavily)       

125
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,969
       (saxophone music)        

126
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,954
       (clippers buzzing)       

127
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:49,501
           (VDlaughs)           

128
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:56,541
  VD: Old, young, old, young.   

129
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,485
          VD: Retired.          

130
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,687
          Not retired.          

131
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,622
       (clippers buzzing)       

132
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:18,997
            VD: You!            

133
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,765
          Will direct.          

134
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,504
              Hmm.              

135
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,806
         I will direct.         

136

       will never get me.       

305
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,160
     The crystals are mine.

   You'll never get me ha ha!   

310
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,200
            Oh, God.            

311
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:48,079
       A word, if I may.        

312
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,248
      Burton: Oh, Sir           
      Jeffrey, of course.       

313
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,749
       Let me know what         
       I can do for you.        

314
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:55,720
 Sir Jeffrey: You will never    
 get me, the crystals are mine. 

315
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:59,457
Does the previous sentence have 
a ring of familiarity to it?    

316
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,592
        Burton: Sort of.        

317
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,962
   Sir Jeffrey: Shall we        
   call it by its real name?    

318
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,096
         Burton: What?          

319
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,130
      Sir Jeffrey: Cliche.      

320
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,433
 Do you want me saying cliches? 

321
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,568
          Burton: No.           

322
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,270
   Sir Jeffrey: What exactly    
   was it about this script     

323
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,505
      that made you want        
      to make this movie?       

324
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:18,009
 Why don't you re-title the     
 film and call it, The Cliche?  

325
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:20,211
   Then it can be a comedy      
   and I can laugh about it.    

326
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,612
Burton: What do you want to say?

327
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:24,415
  Sir Jeffrey: I want the       
  words to not be plagarized.   

328
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,751
 I want them to have something  
 to say that vaguely resembles  

329
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,721
  my character, who is fucking  
  religious by the way.         

330
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:33,124
    "The crystals are mine,"    
    what the fuck is that?      

331
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:34,625
        What did you pay        
        for this script?        

332
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,461
      Burton: One hundred.      

333

      of that guy's bulge?

  killing of the big villain,

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,279
   Yes, so after the orgasm,    
   do you have foreplay?        

543
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:17,581
       VD: No. (laughing)       

544
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:20,050
      I just, take a nap.       

545
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:20,985
      Sir Jeffrey: Right.       

546
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:22,186
   Because the movie's over.    

547
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:24,088
       VD: Right, I never       
       watch the credits.       

548
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,990
   Sir Jeffrey: So, why would   
   you kill a little bad guy    

549
00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:28,626
    after you've just           
    killed the big bad guy?     

550
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:31,028
  VD: Because he is a bad guy.  

551
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,064
     Sir Jeffrey: Yes, but      
     you see, umm, killing      

552
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:37,034
   of the little bad guys is    
   the foreplay that leads up   

553
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:40,571
   to killing of the big bad    
   guy, which is the climax.    

554
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:43,173
    VD: I don't understand.     

555
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:45,342
   Sir Jeffrey: Okay, umm...    

556
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:49,179
  Action-adventure movies are   
  really like romance movies.   

557
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:52,283
  The romantic hero identifies  
  the beautiful girl,           

558
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:56,020
 chases after her, romances     
 her, finally gets to have her. 

559
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:57,354
           ...Climax!           

560
00:25:57,356 --> 00:26:01,091
    Action-adventure hero,      
    identifies the bad guy,     

561
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:04,228
    chases after him after      
    some close encounters ,     

562
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,263
   finally the bad guy's        
   caught and killed, climax!   

563
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:09,166
   So you see it's, it's        
   almost like a love story.    

564
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:12,036
       VD: But, I don't         
       love the villain.        

565

  Sir Jeffrey: Well no, of      
  course, but , but you know,

      fuck him. (chuckles)

568
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,908
       Sir Jeffrey: Yes.        

569
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,578
           VD: Where?           

570
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,079
          In the butt?          

571
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,381
        Sir Jeffrey: No!        

572
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:26,016
     VD: Well then they...      

573
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:28,152
           Or they...           

574
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:31,255
              69?               

575
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,023
       Sir Jeffrey: No,         
       it was a metaphor!       

576
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:34,658
        VD: A metaphor.         

577
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,193
      Sir Jeffrey: You          
      don't know metaphor?      

578
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:38,395
VD: Hmm, comes before meta-five.

579
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:40,030
      Sir Jeffrey: It           
      doesn't come at all.      

580
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:41,665
        VD: It doesn't?         

581
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:42,866
        Sir Jeffrey: No.        

582
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:46,070
     VD: So Jeffrey, could      
     you explain please,        

583
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:49,139
  but with the smaller words.   

584
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:52,977
 Sir Jeffrey: Look, as the      
 script is now, it's as though  

585
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:55,379
 you get to fuck the beautiful  
 girl that you'be been          

586
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:57,615
 chasing after the whole        
 movie, then you climb off her, 

587
00:26:57,617 --> 00:26:59,750
   go into the next room,       
   and fuck her ugly sister!    

588
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:01,185

       Sir Jeffrey: Why?        

591
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:07,758

  fuck the sister, you should.

     because they could         

599

VD: Okay, it's working, oh yes! 

689
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:03,921
  Sir Jeffrey: Sophocles heard  
  it long ago on the Aegean,    

690
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:06,690
  and it brought into his       
  mind the turbid ebb and flow  

691
00:32:06,692 --> 00:32:09,660
        of human misery.        

692

      point in the fight,       

705
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:34,745
     get rid of the swords.

             Okay.              

708
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:45,055
  By now, Darkwing has managed  
  to get me in a sleeper hold.  

709

     But the last minute, I

       him on the ground.

   the fight to be realistic?   

715

       Nobody can get out

    continue the fight, huh?    

721
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,581
       VD: Are you afraid       
       of the great VD?         

722
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:12,816
      You think I don't         
      know what I'm doing?      

723
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,752
    You think I got this way    
    from being photographed?    

724
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,821
 My chi will overpower your chi 

725

       you are afraid of.

       am proving a point       

735
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:39,176

       Burton: Ha, okay.        

737
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,682
     VD: Don't do anything      
     until I say go.            

738

   what we're doing already.

    definitely not a rumor.     

773
00:36:26,285 --> 00:36:27,717
     Tattoo assistant: This     
     is what he wanted.

 Tattoo artist: It took about   
 2000 pricks on his porksword.

           I saw it.

 He had a, he had a tattoo of

  a talon going over the tip.

   What was the circumstance?   

787

   Patrick: No, he just         
   decided to show it to me.    

788
00:36:57,783 --> 00:36:59,816

       your trousers up.        

789
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:00,984

    you a quick visual,         

791
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,653

 and blue talons on the right.  

793
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:08,325
      It's like, an eagle.      

794
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:09,426
        Very patriotic.

to fly it would be wings.

       make here, now.          

801
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,541
  When the medic hits VD with   
  the smelling salts, okay,

      I want you to roll

   flipped you over his back    
   and onto the floor, okay?

  rape and kill your sister,

      it was an accident.

  Oh, that's okay because I     
  live my life out of love now

 I have the key to your heart.

     I cannot find the key.

    My mommy, she breastfed     
    me, I love breasts.         

1012

       in the world that

    instead of hitting you,     

1019
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,240
       I could help you.

1039
00:50:19,384 --> 00:50:20,783
  And then, you could direct.

00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:25,874
             Oops.              

1206
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:28,544
       I said lick, so          
       I have to, sorry.        

1207
00:57:28,546 --> 00:57:30,145
           Ha hahaha!           

1208
00:57:30,147 --> 00:57:32,581
Sir Jeffrey: Do chicks dig that?

1209
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:35,951
       VD: They go crazy.       

1210
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:37,653
  Sir Jeffrey: Boy, you've had  
  some breaks, haven't you?     

1211
00:57:37,655 --> 00:57:39,988
     VD: A little luck has      
     hit me on the head.        

1212
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:43,058
      Among other things.       

1213
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:47,663
    Sir Jeffrey: Is it true     
    that you went down on       

1214
00:57:47,665 --> 00:57:50,899
  all those chicks in front of  
  everyone at your birthday?    

1215
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:53,135
         VD: Of course.         

1216
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:55,804
 Sir Jeffrey: Aren't you afraid 
 of contracting something?      

1217
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:57,206
          VD: Hmm-mm.           

1218
00:57:57,208 --> 00:57:58,740
       I never get sick.        

1219
00:57:58,742 --> 00:58:03,812
     Life, is the disease,      
     and I am the cure!         

1220
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:08,016
     Is your microphone on?     

1221
00:58:08,018 --> 00:58:09,818
    Disconnect the cable,       
    I once knew a sound guy     

1222
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,721
    who played me a tape        
    once of crews, you know,    

1223
00:58:12,723 --> 00:58:14,857
  going at it in his trailer.   

1224
00:58:14,859 --> 00:58:17,726
            (laughs)            

1225
00:58:17,728 --> 00:58:19,661
     You know what he says      
     when he's cumming?         

1226
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:20,863
       Sir Jeffrey: What?       

1227
00:58:20,865 --> 00:58:23,232
          Crew: Awwww!          

1228
00:58:23,234 --> 00:58:26,268
       VD: No mommy, no!        

1229
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,171
       That's fucked up!        

1230
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:31,740
      Sir Jeffrey: Quite.       

1231
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:41,216
     You must now swear to      
     me that you will never     

1232
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:44,019
    tell a single soul what     
    I'm about to tell you,      

1233
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,655
       or I will hunt you       
       down and kill you.       

1234
00:58:46,657 --> 00:58:50,659
  Sir Jeffrey: You have my      
  solemn word as a gentleman.   

1235
00:58:50,661 --> 00:58:52,728
           VD: Okay.            

1236
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:57,332
 I will now tell you            
 something about the great VD.  

1237
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,235
   No one fucks the great VD.   

1238
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:01,670
  You give me one pile of shit  

1239
00:59:01,672 --> 00:59:04,673
       I will give you          
       100 piles of shit.       

1240
00:59:04,675 --> 00:59:08,877
 Burton, he told me that we     
 were making a 10,000,000 Euro  

1241
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:11,113
     movie, he gives me         
     5,000,000 Euro, right?     

1242
00:59:11,115 --> 00:59:13,348
    What does he spend on       
    this set, like 10 Euro?     

1243
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:16,251
  This set will look like       
  shit, I will look like shit.  

1244
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:19,988
      I don't want them to      
      release this movie.       

1245
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:21,990
   Burton is out there          
   right now eating his shit    

1246
00:59:21,992 --> 00:59:23,592
      and I am salting it.      

1247
00:59:23,594 --> 00:59:26,128
     As long as I do what       
     I am doing, I am free      

1248
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:29,264
       to leave here at         
       midnight tonight.        

1249
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:32,000
     Pretty brilliant, huh?     

1250
00:59:32,002 --> 00:59:32,901
        Sir Jeffrey: But        
        no one will ever        

1251
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:34,269
  want to work with you again.  

1252
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:37,839
  VD: Oh, bullshit, I got a     
  three-picture deal waiting,   

1253
00:59:37,841 --> 00:59:39,675
I could do a television series. 

1254
00:59:39,677 --> 00:59:40,909
      Sir Jeffrey: Really?      

1255
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:44,746
   VD: Oh, my aching vagina!    

1256
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,684
       What's the matter?       

1257
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:50,886
  Sir Jeffrey: Can I tell you   
  a secret that if you tell     

1258
00:59:50,888 --> 00:59:53,055
 anyone else I get to kill you? 

1259
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:56,792
      VD: You have my           
      word as a gentleman.      

1260
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,027
 Sir Jeffrey: Your film is the  
 only job I've been offered     

1261
00:59:59,029 --> 01:00:01,229
     in the last two years.     

1262
01:00:01,231 --> 01:00:03,832
    This job saved my house.    

1263
01:00:03,834 --> 01:00:04,967
           VD: What?!           

1264
01:00:04,969 --> 01:00:07,202
       That is bullshit,        
       fire your agent!         

1265
01:00:07,204 --> 01:00:09,705
    You are the best actor!     

1266
01:00:09,707 --> 01:00:11,373
   Sir Jeffrey: VD, there       
   are a million good actors,   

1267
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:12,908
      but very few stars.       

1268
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:14,376
        You are a star.         

1269
01:00:14,378 --> 01:00:16,311
      I am just an actor.       

1270
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:18,914
 VD: Ha ha no, you are a star.  

1271
01:00:18,916 --> 01:00:21,650
      Sir Jeffrey: A minor      
      twinkler, perhaps.        

1272
01:00:21,652 --> 01:00:23,385
     Only a few stars rise.     

1273
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:26,688
     And you have got yours     
     a long way up there.       

1274
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:29,625
      VD: Yeah my star did      
      go up a little ways.      

1275
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:31,660
       Yours could, too!        

1276
01:00:31,662 --> 01:00:34,062
   Sir Jeffrey: You know how    
   when you meet some people,   

1277
01:00:34,064 --> 01:00:36,231
     you just want to           
     rush up and hug them?      

1278
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:38,100
      There's something         
      about them you just       

1279
01:00:38,102 --> 01:00:39,968
   want to hold close to you?   

1280
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,871
And then there are other        
people who give you the creeps. 

1281
01:00:42,873 --> 01:00:44,706
           VD: Okay.            

1282
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:46,975
   Sir Jeffrey: You have this   
   boyish quality about you.    

1283
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:48,377
         It's adorable.         

1284
01:00:48,379 --> 01:00:51,313
  I am one of those people      
  who give others the creeps.   

1285
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:53,015
            VD: No!             

1286
01:00:53,017 --> 01:00:55,117
 Sir Jeffrey: Who's playing     
 the villain in the movie, hmm? 

1287
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,351
              Who?              

1288
01:00:56,353 --> 01:00:57,686
            VD: You.            

1289
01:00:57,688 --> 01:01:00,922
       Sir Jeffrey: Was         
       that an accident?        

1290
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:03,425
            VD: No.             

1291
01:01:03,427 --> 01:01:04,926
  Sir Jeffrey: And it's okay.   

1292
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:06,828
         Do I look sad?         

1293
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:10,866
   It's been a great            
   living, most of the time.    

1294
01:01:10,868 --> 01:01:12,701
       VD: Do you want to       
       get out of here?         

1295
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:14,403
     Do you want to get out     
     of this stinking set?      

1296
01:01:14,405 --> 01:01:15,904
Sir Jeffrey: I want to go home. 

1297
01:01:15,906 --> 01:01:17,673
  I want to hold my children.   

1298
01:01:17,675 --> 01:01:19,374
     VD: Then the great VD      
     will fire you, too.        

1299
01:01:19,376 --> 01:01:21,743
    Let's do it on the set      
    with more people around.    

1300
01:01:21,745 --> 01:01:23,879
   Maria wanted an audience.    

1301
01:01:23,881 --> 01:01:25,981
    Sir Jeffrey: She            
    wanted you to fire her?     

1302
01:01:25,983 --> 01:01:28,250
     VD: Yes she has to         
     leave tomorrow and         
     wanted to go shopping.     

1303
01:01:28,252 --> 01:01:29,051
      Sir Jeffrey: Really?      

1304
01:01:29,053 --> 01:01:29,985
            VD: Yes.            

1305
01:01:29,987 --> 01:01:32,454
She's going to buy me a present!

1306
01:01:32,456 --> 01:01:35,157
     Sir Jeffrey: VD, that      
     was great acting!          

1307
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:36,692
          VD: Really?           

1308
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:37,459
      (Sir Jeffrey laughs)      

1309
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:39,995
VD: Well, thank you Sir Jeffrey.

1310
01:01:39,997 --> 01:01:41,296
     Think of some really       
     horrible things to say     

1311
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:44,232
      about me, it will         
      be all the more fun.      

1312
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:45,767
      Sir Jeffrey: I            
      think I could muster      

1313
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:47,869
 a few things for the occasion. 

1314
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:49,805
I finally get to do some acting.

1315
01:01:49,807 --> 01:01:51,873
     Yes, yes a performance     
     is in order!               

1316
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,141
 VD: It's going to be fun, yes? 

1317
01:01:53,143 --> 01:01:54,276
       Sir Jeffrey: Yes!        

1318
01:01:54,278 --> 01:01:55,711
           VD: Good!            

1319
01:01:55,713 --> 01:01:58,814
     Sir Jeffrey: VD, what      
     a brilliant surprise.      

1320
01:01:58,816 --> 01:02:01,717
It's been fun working with you. 

1321
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:04,519
    VD: Well not everyone       
    has said that about me.     

1322
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:10,459
           Thank you.           

1323
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:17,365
  You see, I want to hug you.   

1324
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:22,537
     Burton: I told you he      
     hits for other team.       

1325
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:25,340
        Emily: Baseball?        

1326
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:29,945
       VD: See you on the       
       set, Sir Jeffrey.        

1327
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:39,855
     (whistles ¶The Good,       
     the Bad and the Ugly¶)     

1328
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:47,529
     Sir Jeffrey: You know      
     what your problem is?      

1329
01:02:47,531 --> 01:02:49,898
 No one says no to you anymore. 

1330
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,367
     When was the last time     
     anyone said no to you?     

1331
01:02:52,369 --> 01:02:55,971
    When was the last time      
    you said no to yourself?    

1332
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:59,040
VD: What are you talking about? 

1333
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:03,044
   Sir Jeffrey: What is a       
   man if his chief good and    

1334
01:03:03,046 --> 01:03:07,315
     market of his time         
     be to sleep and feed.      

1335
01:03:07,317 --> 01:03:09,851
        A beast no more.        

1336
01:03:09,853 --> 01:03:13,455
      The best part of you      
      is not being fed.         

1337
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:15,023
          VD: Why not?          

1338
01:03:15,025 --> 01:03:16,792
  Sir Jeffrey: Because you've   
  locked it away from yourself  

1339
01:03:16,794 --> 01:03:20,328
  and from everyone else with   
  bars of coke and drugs.       

1340
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:22,364
 VD: It's not bars, it's lines. 

1341
01:03:22,366 --> 01:03:23,231
     Sir Jeffrey: Whatever!     

1342
01:03:23,233 --> 01:03:24,199
          It's drugs.           

1343
01:03:24,201 --> 01:03:25,534
 It's killing your discipline.  

1344
01:03:25,536 --> 01:03:27,302
   And you being a star, it's   
   killing the discipline       

1345
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:28,904
    of everyone around you.     

1346
01:03:28,906 --> 01:03:31,139
    You have too much power.    

1347
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:33,575
   And everyone is afraid       
   of losing favor with you,    

1348
01:03:33,577 --> 01:03:36,545
    or you're going to use      
    your power against them.    

1349
01:03:36,547 --> 01:03:38,547
     Everyone is afraid         
     to say no to you, but      

1350
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:41,917
       all they have to         
       do is just say no.       

1351
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:43,485
 VD: You want to say no to me?  

1352
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:45,620
   Sir Jeffrey: Yes, everyone   
   should say no to you.        

1353
01:03:45,622 --> 01:03:49,825
   Because you are an addict,   
   and you belong in rehab.     

1354
01:03:49,827 --> 01:03:51,259
     VD: You say no to me?      

1355
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:53,395
       Sir Jeffrey: Yes,        
       I say no to you.         

1356
01:03:53,397 --> 01:03:55,197
 VD: You want to say no to me?  

1357
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:56,231
       Sir Jeffrey: Yes.        

1358
01:03:56,233 --> 01:03:58,567
        VD: You say no?         

1359
01:03:58,569 --> 01:03:59,334
       Sir Jeffrey: Yes.        

1360
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:00,569
         VD: No or yes?         

1361
01:04:00,571 --> 01:04:02,070
    Sir Jeffrey: I say no to    
    you, and everyone else      

1362
01:04:02,072 --> 01:04:03,238
 should say no to you as well!  

1363
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:06,842
      VD: You want to say       
      no to the great VD.       

1364
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:12,347
  Ha ha, well, man of flowery   
  words, then you are stupid.   

1365
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:15,450
   Because no one says no to    
   the great VD, especially     

1366
01:04:15,452 --> 01:04:18,320
    when VD is the director!    

1367
01:04:18,322 --> 01:04:20,589
         So I fire you!         

1368
01:04:20,591 --> 01:04:23,225
        Get off my set!         

1369
01:04:23,227 --> 01:04:24,993
     Sir Jeffrey: You think     
     having to leave your       

1370
01:04:24,995 --> 01:04:27,429
  little playground here,       
  your sandbox, is punishment?  

1371
01:04:27,431 --> 01:04:30,632
      (Sir Jeffrey laughs)      

1372
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:32,467
       VD: Hey, don't let       
       the door hit your        

1373
01:04:32,469 --> 01:04:35,971
  flowery dick on the way out.  

1374
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:42,677
      Sir Jeffrey: You're       
      not a hero, VD.           

1375
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:44,946
      You're a movie star.      

1376
01:04:44,948 --> 01:04:46,181
            An icon.            

1377
01:04:46,183 --> 01:04:48,016
   That is not as               
   substantial or deep as the   

1378
01:04:48,018 --> 01:04:50,585
film your image is recorded on. 

1379
01:04:50,587 --> 01:04:54,956
   A vapid photon, glittering   
   for an ignorant audience.    

1380
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:57,926
 I pity, really pity your fans. 

1381
01:04:57,928 --> 01:04:59,661
   I wish they knew what an     
   appalling effort it takes    

1382
01:04:59,663 --> 01:05:02,898
    to get your facade ready    
    to be photographed.         

1383
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:05,567
       A photograph of a        
       facade that moves.       

1384
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:08,703
      That is how I             
      shall remember you.       

1385
01:05:08,705 --> 01:05:12,107
    You cannot hear my no,      
    but you will hear the no    

1386
01:05:12,109 --> 01:05:15,477
    that life delivers you.     

1387
01:05:16,145 --> 01:05:20,482
    VD, you are the disease.    

1388
01:05:20,484 --> 01:05:24,386
      And you, and you          
      alone are the cure.       

1389
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:30,025
           (applause)           

1390
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:47,142
   (spacey teleporting noise)   

1391
01:05:58,521 --> 01:06:01,990
      VD: I am the disease      
      and I am the cure.        

1392
01:06:01,992 --> 01:06:05,627
That was my line, he changed it.

1393
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:09,331
         He was joking.         

1394
01:06:09,333 --> 01:06:12,233
         Joke's on you.         

1395
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:21,142
Burton: VD, where are you going?

1396
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:24,179
       VD: I'll be back.        

1397
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:26,982
       Burton: We have to       
       finish the movie.        

1398
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:36,725
    VD: People are supposed     
    to say no to me,            

1399
01:06:36,727 --> 01:06:39,260
    you wanna say no to me?     

1400
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:43,999
   Burton: Okay, umm, no, no!   

1401
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:47,268
     You cannot leave set.      

1402
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:08,089
         VD: Fuck you.          

1403
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:22,604
          (sad music)           

1404

1405

   Soundman: [unintelligible]   

1406
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:45,760
    VD: You want to say no?     

1407
01:07:45,762 --> 01:07:47,562
             To me?             

1408
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:50,432
        To the great VD?        

1409
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:54,069
    You should say no to me.    

1410
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:04,879
           (sneezes)            

1411

1412
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:09,350
      VD: What, did I get       
      some on my face?          

1413
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:17,692
      Burton: What, what,       
      what are you doing?       

1414
01:08:17,694 --> 01:08:20,095
   VD: My dick says no to me.   

1415
01:08:20,097 --> 01:08:21,663
     My dick says no to me.     

1416
01:08:21,665 --> 01:08:22,664
       Burton: Stop this!       

1417
01:08:22,666 --> 01:08:25,266
            Stop it!            

1418

    What are you doing here?

something to remember me by.    

1427
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:44,452
    VD: Oh thank you, Maria.    

1428
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:46,354
    I didn't think maybe        
    you were gonna actually     

1429
01:08:46,356 --> 01:08:47,589
      go shopping for me.

 it's not love, it's location.  

1441

          VD: I know.           

1442
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:18,453
     But it's still sad         
     to see you go anyway.

     can keep hoisting him      

1473
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:52,947
     right out of building?     

1474

      they have something       

1475
01:10:54,317 --> 01:10:56,651
       even better than         
       even that planned.       

1476
01:10:56,653 --> 01:10:59,921
            VD: Woo!            

1477
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:02,390
             Whoa!              

1478
01:11:02,392 --> 01:11:05,326
     That was a little bit      
     too fast there, Mark.      

1479
01:11:05,328 --> 01:11:09,897
 I'm a-spinning like that       
 little thing with the horses,  

1480
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:12,033
         the round one.         

1481
01:11:12,035 --> 01:11:15,336
 I, I think the balance is off. 

1482
01:11:15,338 --> 01:11:17,805
      I'm a-stuck-ed here.      

1483

    VD: It's uncomfortable.

01:11:23,546 --> 01:11:27,849
 I don't, I don't feel so good. 

1488

     VD: I told Louie I         
     did not want the fish.     

1492
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:39,327
  Mark: VD are you all right?   

1493
01:11:39,329 --> 01:11:44,599

1503
01:12:36,886 --> 01:12:38,820
         VD, VD, here.          

1504

        VD, talk to me.         

1505
01:12:40,457 --> 01:12:41,622
          Talk to me.

    Mark: Get in here, come     
    on come on come on!         

1507
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,662
  Ivan: That was a puke smell.  

1508
01:12:47,664 --> 01:12:49,564
        Paint: I think I        
        know what it is.        

1509
01:12:49,566 --> 01:12:50,732
          Ivan: What?           

1510
01:12:50,734 --> 01:12:53,101
      Paint: The uh, the        
      tattoo, the talons.       

1511
01:12:53,103 --> 01:12:55,103
          Ivan: Yeah?           

1512
01:12:55,105 --> 01:12:57,138
     Paint: I think it's a      
     straight shot into his     

1513
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:58,773
    subconscious, he knows.     

1514
01:12:58,775 --> 01:13:00,174
          Ivan: What?           

1515
01:13:00,176 --> 01:13:02,176
   Paint: He knows that he      
   is controlled by his dick.   

1516
01:13:02,178 --> 01:13:05,780
   And his dick is controlled   
   by some winged thing         

1517
01:13:05,782 --> 01:13:08,182
     in the sky that he has     
     no control over, some      

1518
01:13:08,184 --> 01:13:11,986
    winged, whimsical beast     
    that has pulled him         

1519
01:13:11,988 --> 01:13:15,823
 and yanked him and the talons  
 are deep into his flesh,       

1520
01:13:15,825 --> 01:13:19,127
     and he can't control       
     it, and it's like he's     

1521
01:13:19,129 --> 01:13:20,661
telling his dick that he knows. 

1522
01:13:20,663 --> 01:13:22,663
  It's a concession of sorts.   

1523
01:13:22,665 --> 01:13:24,999
  He's conceding to his dick.   

1524
01:13:25,001 --> 01:13:26,968
     Ivan: He was blown out     
     of his mind and uh,        

1525
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:28,770
       probably picked          
       the wrong picture.       

1526
01:13:28,772 --> 01:13:30,538
      Paint: No, he knows.      

1527
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:32,907
      It's a recognition        
      of your own faults.       

1528
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:35,143
     You know it actually       
     takes a lot of, he may     

1529
01:13:35,145 --> 01:13:36,811
have more insight than we think.

1530
01:13:36,813 --> 01:13:38,179
     You know, God damn,        
     the tattoo, I like it.     

1531
01:13:38,181 --> 01:13:40,081
     Son of a bitch knows!      

1532
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:42,817
           He knows!            

1533
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:44,051
    Mark: Can I get a           
    gurney in here, please?     

1534
01:13:44,053 --> 01:13:47,822

1535

    Here we go, here we go.     

1536
01:13:53,496 --> 01:13:54,695
   Get him off, get him off.    

1537
01:13:54,697 --> 01:13:56,164
  Let's go, let's go let's go!  

1538
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:59,567
Mark: How 'bout some help, Ivan!

1539
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:00,701
        Mark: We got it.        

1540
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:17,585
         Medic: Clear!          

1541
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:24,192
 Ivan: Do you believe in karma? 

1542
01:14:24,194 --> 01:14:26,461
  Paint: Well, yeah, but it's   
  not often you get to see      

1543

  the big wheel go all the      
  way around in one lifetime.   

1544
01:14:31,034 --> 01:14:33,935
   Ivan: I know you're          
   liking his tattoo, but uh,   

1545
01:14:33,937 --> 01:14:35,937
     he shits on everybody.     

1546
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:41,175
 His wife, his children, he     
 probably shits on his own dog. 

1547

1549
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:59,160
      This is not a wrap!       

1550

      We will shoot the

1561

  I was, I was Peter Pan,

       fippy-fippy thing.
