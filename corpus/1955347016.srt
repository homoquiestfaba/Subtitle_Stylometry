1
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,282
AMY: I'm Amy Mitchell,
and I'm a mom.

2
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,208
I had my first kid
when I was 20 years old,

3
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,408
and I've been running late ever since.

4
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,802
My days are filled with
dropping the kids at school...

5
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,881
Love you.

6
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,403
...then racing to work
where I have meeting,

7
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,648
after meeting, after meeting.

8
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,084
I usually end up eating
a shitty lunch at my desk,

9
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,649
and I try to work out once a week.

10
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,805
(SIGHS)
Why do I suck at Zumba?

11
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,085
Most days,
I race back to school
for the kids' plays,

12
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,441
and poetry readings and class projects...

13
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,407
Mom!

14
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,164
...which I'm always late for.
(MOUTHING) Sorry.

15
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,050
And then there's PTA meetings,

16
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,926
and volunteering
and parent-teacher
conferences.

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,646
Jesus, Miss Wiggins fuckin' hates me.

18
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,442
At least once a day,
I feel like the worst mom
in the world,

19
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,965
and I cry in my car.

20
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,684
(WAILING)

21
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,605
Then I shuttle the kids
to piano lessons
and soccer games

22
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,409
and dance classes
and doctors' appointments,

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,488
before my daily trip
to the grocery store.

24
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,241
Ugh.

25
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,005
This chick seems like
she's got it all figured out.

26
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,370
But I feel like
I'm screwing up
all the time.

27
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,608
Still, I love being a mom.

28
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,728
Here, baby.
There's your organic
turkey club sandwich,

29
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,644
and Dylan,
here's your peanut-free
peanut butter for lunch.

30
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,767
What's peanut-free
peanut butter?

31
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,841
I have no idea.

32
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,931
Baby, here's your
American history project
I made you.

33
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,041
I hope you like it.

34
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,522
I love you.
I love you!

35
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,002
Oh, my God, Mom!
Not so loud! My God.

36
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,889
I love my babies so much!

37
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,365
God, they hate me.

38
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,166
Hey, Amy!

39
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,685
Hey, guys.

40
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,168
God, I just don't know how you do it.

41
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,969
You just leave your kids all day

42
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,121
and go to work?

43
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,361
You're so strong.

44
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,325
Yeah, thank you.

45
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,283
Don't you miss them?

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,650
I do. But I also
need, like, money.

47
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,881
Right.
STACY: Hmm.

48
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,769
Oh, gosh, you guys,
I'm so sorry.
I gotta go.

49
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,126
I'm really late to work.

50
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,004
Well, you're always late.

51
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,809
I know. It's basically
the only thing

52
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,166
I'm good at these days.

53
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,287
See you guys later.

54
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,529
God, I just love how hard she works.

55
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,722
Oh, my God, I love how hard she works.

56
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,565
I just fuckin' said that, Vicky.

57
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,921
(TIRES SCREECHING)

58
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,167
AMY: I work at
a super-hip coffee company.

59
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,526
I love my job,

60
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,884
but I'm 32 years old and
I'm the oldest person here
by far.

61
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,486
Most of these dudes
just play ping-pong all day.

62
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,921
TESSA: Morning, Momma.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,001
AMY: Morning, Tessa.

64
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,846
Oh, my God,
I am so fucking hungover,
I might actually die.

65
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,126
(CHUCKLES)

66
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,487
That's probably something
you shouldn't tell your boss.

67
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,601
Oh.

68
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,849
Right. Except that I took
like a shitload of
pills this morning,

69
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,491
so I don't totally know where I am yet.

70
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,641
You're at work, Tess.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,604
Oh, perfect.
Yeah.

72
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,286
May I have a vacation?
I'd like to go to Cuba.

73
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,284
Is that allowed?
No.

74
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,840
Good morning.

75
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,166
TESSA: Hey, boss!

76
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,401
Good morning, Dale.

77
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,170
I had a dream last night.

78
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,323
Ooh.
I was naked in a hotel.

79
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,164
I'm talking fully naked, dick, balls...

80
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,327
Yep, got it.

81
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,926
No glasses. Everything,
fully fucking naked.

82
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,121
We got it.

83
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,690
I walk over to the coffee maker

84
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,169
and there is
a bag of our coffee
in the hotel room.

85
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,760
Cool dream, Dale.

86
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,046
Thank you, Tessa.

87
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,167
(CHUCKLES)
Um...

88
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,163
Is this your way of saying that

89
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,766
you wanna start selling
your coffee to
hotels, now?

90
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,486
No. This is my way
of saying that
I want you

91
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,801
to start selling
our coffee to
hotels now.

92
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,611
But Dale, I'm already
running sales
for supermarkets,

93
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,364
airlines and restaurants.

94
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,880
I mean,
I'm just part-time.

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,001
You are?
Since when?

96
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,241
Six years ago!

97
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,170
(LAUGHS) What?
No way.

98
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,486
She's here like
every day.
(CHUCKLES)

99
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,689
(CHUCKLES)
Oh, I know, but I have
a family and stuff, so...

100
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,768
Hey! You know
how important
family is to me.

101
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,410
I got it wrote on my arm right there.

102
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,481
AMY: Oh, wow.

103
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,244
It's dope, right?
So tight.

104
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,721
Oh, shit!
I gotta go roller skating.
Do you wanna come?

105
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,444
Yes!
No, Dale!

106
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,369
I have lots of work to do.

107
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,001
The History Channel was right.

108
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,764
You guys are the greatest generation.

109
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,806
AMY: I live just outside
of Chicago with my two kids,

110
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,769
my dog and my husband, Mike.

111
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,329
He's a successful mortgage broker,

112
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,971
but sometimes he
feels like my third child.

113
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,003
Hey, babe.
Hey... Oh! (CHUCKLES)

114
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,730
Look at all
the bags you're carrying.
That's hilarious.

115
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,205
You look like a Sherpa.

116
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,927
AMY: Oh!

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,163
You guys. Thank you
for being super patient.

118
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,481
I appreciate it.

119
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,006
(GROANS)
Here we go, guys.

120
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,206
Thanks, honey.

121
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,123
All right, love.
How was work?

122
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,523
Oh, I had two
conference calls and then
I took a nap.

123
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,011
It was exhausting.

124
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,489
I bet. I bet.
Uh...

125
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,567
Dylan, baby, how was your science quiz?

126
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,126
Oh, I got a D.

127
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,804
A D? But we
worked so hard.

128
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,881
Baby, what happened?

129
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,362
Do you need extra help?
Should we get
you another tutor?

130
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,891
Mmm, nah, I'm good.

131
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,686
Mike?

132
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,366
Did you hear?
Dylan got a D
on his science quiz.

133
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,560
Way to go, bud.

134
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,489
What? Okay.

135
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,881
Um...

136
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,930

How was your
soccer tryouts?

Baby, it's okay, relax.
You will make
the soccer team, I promise.

so awesome on

you're only 12,
so it's...

00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,881
Wait.

154
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,606

you're gonna be fine,
you're...

No! It's not fine, Mom.

158
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,130
Do you understand how hard it is

159
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,123
to get into an Ivy League school now?

160

00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,530
That's a little racist, but...

Oh, my God! I need to
practice my footwork.

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,126
Uh, who the hell are you?

175
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,570
I'm his wife.

176
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,887
Oh, shit.

177
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,121
Are you masturbating
online with
some chick?

178
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,440
No, no!

179
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,726
Well, then, what are you doing?

180
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,725
(STAMMERING) Uh, um...
I was clicking
and then I...

181
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,641
So then I was...

182
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,246
Yes, okay,
I was masturbating
online with some chick.

183
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,681
What the fuck!
Why are you doing that?

184
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,765
Hold on a second.
I don't think I've
done anything wrong.

185
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,808
This is totally mainstream now.

186
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,325
Hi, I'm Sharon.

187
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,486
I don't know, I don't know, Mike.

188
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,530
This really feels like cheating.

189
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,924
No, no, no, no, no,
this is definitely
not cheating, honey.

190
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,286
I've never even touched her.

191
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,091
Her giant bush is 2,000 miles away.

192
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,007
But how long have you been doing this?

193
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,009
Oh, I don't know.
Not long.

194
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,570
Ten months next Friday.

What the fuck?

196
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,920
Ten months?

197
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,882
Do you have feelings for her?

(EXHALES)

199
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,522
You don't masturbate
online with someone
for 10 months

200
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,931
without developing some feelings.

201
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,445
I mean, I'm not a monster.

202
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,642
Do you have feelings for her, Mike?

203
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,724
Yes! Okay?
I have feelings
for her! God!

she's developing an app.

208

Get out!
What?

209
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,605
Get the fuck out of my house.

had to go outta town
on a business trip,

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,566
so I'm gonna try to do
everything myself today,

218
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,201
which should be fine,

as long as everybody does
what they are
supposed to do.

Oh, no.

like boom, boom, click.

Oh, gosh.

I think I'd let him
put it in my butt.

I mean, in theory,
I'm not really
into the butt thing,

go to town back there.

have to carry him
until he gets home.

Jane is late.

I am the president of the PTA,

I am the proud mommy
to two beautiful daughters,

326
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,882
Now, I called this emergency PTA meeting

327
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,249
to address an issue
that radically affects
the safety of our children.

328
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,927
The bake sale.

329
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,810
Is this a joke?

330
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,121
Now, this is a list
of the toxic ingredients

331
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,601
that are absolutely banned
from the bake sale.

332
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,849
No BPA, no MSG, no BHA, no BHT.

333
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,491
Plus no soy, no sesame,
and, of course, no nuts

334
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,006
or eggs or milk or butter
or salt or sugar or wheat.

335
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,081
Okay?

336
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,003
Sorry, what ingredients can we use?

337
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,809
Anyway,
I will be putting together...
Thank you.

338
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,929
...a special bake
sale police force

339
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,166
that will monitor the food.
That will destroy
any offensive treats

340
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,445
and prosecute the wrongdoers.

341
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,601
Yes.

342
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,331
So who will be my first volunteer

343
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,561
for the bake sale police force?

344
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,725
I think we're gonna have Amy Mitchell!

345
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,201
What?

346
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,044
That's what you get
for being late, sweetie.

347
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,041

Are you having a senior moment?

523
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,690
I've actually never felt better.

524
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,367
I'm having a quiet breakfast
and reading the newspaper

525
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,727
for the first time in 12 years.

526
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,726
You need to come into
the office right now!

527
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,521
No, I don't. I don't, Dale.
I only work for you
three days a week.

528
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,208
If you want me to work more,
then you should
pay me to do that.

529
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,810
Okay, Amy, you're
kind of making
me look like a dick

530
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,370
in front of everybody
in the office right now.

531
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,807
Have a great meeting!
Goodbye, Dale.

532
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,801
(SIGHS)

533
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,609
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

534
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,402
Hello?
Hey, Kiki. It's Amy.

535
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,481
Hi!

536
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,324
Um, I was actually calling to see,

537
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,243
uh, if you'd like to join
me at the movies today.

538
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,924
Are we allowed to do that?

539
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,004
Well, I don't see why not.

540
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,090
I can't.
I mean, I have to
iron Kent's underwear.

541
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,561
What? Why?

542
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,928
I don't know. He likes
really stiff underwear.

543
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,202
Come on, Kiki, live a little.

544
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,361
(CRYING)

545
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,286
Uh... Okay. Okay, okay.
I'll do it.

546
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,762
(CHUCKLES) Awesome.
Okay, I'll call Carla.

547
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,082
Oh, fun! I like her.

548
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,611
I'm also very scared of her.

549
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,601
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

550
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,649
Ow! Ow!

551
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,930
CARLA: Yo!
Hey, it's Amy.

552
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,445
Um, I'm calling to see
if you'd like to join

553
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,965
Kiki and I at the movies this afternoon.

554
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,201
I'm already here.

555
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,281
Hey, lady.

556
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,009
Get off your phone.
Guess what?

557
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,445
She dies in the end.

558
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,126
Yeah, cancer gets her.

559
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,481
What?

560
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,848
Yeah, what do you bitches wanna see?

561
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,161
(SLURPING)

562
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,770
Love is stronger

563
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,640
than space.

564
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,127
You guys, lady boners over here.

565
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,241

(GASPING AND CHEERING)

567
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,648
Cheers, ladies.
Mmm.

568
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,961
Mmm.

569
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,041
This has been so much fun.

570
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,525
Thank you, girls, for coming out with me.

571
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,641
Are you kidding me?

572
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,929
This has literally been
the best day of
my entire life.

573
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,206
Oh, honey.

574
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,164
My ex is picking
up the kid, so I can
go all night if...

575
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,209
Oh, hey, did you hear that?

576
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,691
My ex has my kid.

577
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,650
AMY: Hey, hon, I've got
a question for you.

578
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,930
Is it hard to share
your son with
your ex-husband?

579
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,606
(LAUGHS) Fuck no.
No?

580
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,967
Have you seen my kid?
He's like nine feet tall

581
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,724
and all he cares about is baseball.

582
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,404
Do you go to all of his games?

583
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,482
No. No, I don't.
(AMY LAUGHS)

584
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,524
The last game
I went to was
six hours long

585
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,443
and the final score was one to two.

586
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,520
So, I'd rather go to
Afghanistan than another
kids' baseball game.

587
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,601
Cheers.

588
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,886
How do you think
that your divorce
affected your kid?

589
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,168
How are things in your home, Amy?

590
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,203
Oh, it's fine.
(SCOFFS) Everything's fine.

591
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,801
Ugh.

592
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,209
I caught Mike
having an affair online
with a woman,

593
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,886
and I guess
it's been going on
for like 10 months.

594
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,486
Oh! Did you drive
a spike through his nuts?

595
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,886
(LAUGHING)

596
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,890
No. Here's the truth.

597
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,121
Our marriage has been over for years.

598
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,046
I don't even remember
the last time we had sex.

599
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,168
Kent and I have sex
every Friday night
after Blue Bloods.

600
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,841
(LAUGHS)

601
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,647
I find Tom Selleck's work
to be extremely erotic.

602
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,047
I feel like everything that
comes out of your
mouth is a cry for help.

603
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,324
(CHUCKLES)
Kiki, you're so weird.

604
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,526
CARLA: No, wait,

605
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,921
why did you
marry this shithead
in the first place?

606
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,126
He sounds like an asshole.

607
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,804
Because we were young and in love.

608
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,326
I mean, he wasn't
always an asshole.
I promise you.

609
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,123
It's true.
Listen, I got pregnant,
we got married.

610
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,645
I was only 20.

611
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,125
You know what?
Mike and I never
got our twenties.

612
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,601
Like, you know, the fun twenties, and...

613
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,886
I feel like maybe he missed that.

614
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,961
Oh, my God.

615
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,885
Maybe I did, too.

616
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,531
When I was in my
twenties, I would just
walk down the street

617
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,763
and it would just
be raining dicks
wherever I went.

618
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,046
It was just dick, dick, dick, dick,

619
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,281
dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.

620
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,170
It was, like, forecast, lot of cock!

621
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,844
(INDISTINCT)

622
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,967
Kiki?

623
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,282
Hi. Kent, hi.

624
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,726
What are you doing here?

625
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,246
I'm just having lunch
with my new friends.

626
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,448
Who's watching the kids?
Rosie.

627
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,045
Isn't that your job?

628
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,965
Whoa! Who the fuck
are you?

629
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,321
Yes. Yes, Kent.

630
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,007
It absolutely is my job,
and I was just
about to leave, so,

631
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,487
um, thank you guys so much.

632
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,409
I can't, uh, do the math right now.

633
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,370
Just take that
and have a wonderful
day, you guys.

634
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,680
I really enjoyed it.
Thank you.

635
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,807
Oh, my...

636
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,962
Nice to meet you, Ike Turner!

637
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,771
That's really disturbing.

638
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,921
Yes!

639
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,123
But on the plus side,
she left way too much cash,

640
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,009
so I think I'm gonna get fucked up!

641
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,283
(GROANS)

642
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,605
Yeah, donut holes!

643
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,125
I love these things.
How much are they?

644
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,366
Um...

645
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,921
Five cents.

646
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,923
How about a dollar?

647
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,684
(GASPS) What?

648
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,649
Hey now, big spender.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

649
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,207
Thank you.

650
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,966
Mmm.

651
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,601
Why are these so good?
Caramel number six.

652
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,920
Is that what it is?
Mmm-hmm.

653
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,687
They're tasty.

654
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,609
She's adorable.
Thank you.

655
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,721
Mmm-hmm.

656
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,281
Good to see you.

657
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,124
Bye. Bye.

658
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,606
Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my.
What do we have here?

659
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,251
Are these store-bought
donut holes, Amy?

660
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,211
What? No.

661
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,009
Gosh, no, I made them by hand

662
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,084
and then I put them
in the weird
plastic container.

663
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,844
Oh, thank God.
'Cause we do not

664
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,445
allow store-bought
holes.

665
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,562
Seriously, Vicky?
AMY: Oh,
come on, Gwendolyn.

666
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,165
Who cares what food people bring

667
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,890
as long as it raises money, right?

668
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,122
Oh, did she just...
Oh.
She did.

669
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,885
Hit her with it, G.

670
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,571
Well, you see, I care, sweetie.

671
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,881
I don't... I don't know
what's been going on
with you,

672
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,486
I mean, with your weird outbursts

673
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,086
and your terrible style,

674
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,844
but it ends now.

675
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,128
Okay? I run this school,

676
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,000
and no one takes a class or kicks a ball

677
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,607
or plays a fuckin'
clarinet without
my say-so.

678
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,967
And I can make life a living hell for you

679
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,849
and your dirty little children.

680
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,805
Do you understand me?

681
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,362
Wow, Gwendolyn,
I genuinely think you should
just relax a little bit,

682
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,647
I mean, have a donut hole.
They're delicious.

683
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,882
They're from a gas station.
They're... Mmm.

684
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,641
You have crossed the line, little girl.

685
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,609
And I am going to destroy you.

686
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,610
Winter is coming.

687
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,041
(CHUCKLES)

688
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,167
Gwendolyn.

689
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,846
Oh, my God.
You are so fucked.

690
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,487
What...

691
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,530
Bye.
Bye.

692
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,451
Out of my way!

693
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,400
I'm sorry, Gwendolyn.

694
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,449
You psyched for Mandarin class?

695
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,726
No!
No.

696
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,609
Mandarin class is so stressful.

697
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,887
Everyone just barfs the whole time.

698
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,803
Did you say "barfs"?
Yeah.

699
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,845
Oh, my God.

700
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,166
Wha...

701
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,683
Why are we doing this?

702
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,485
What are you doing?
Mandarin class
is back that way!

703
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,561
I know.

704
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,490
But we're gonna play hooky today.

705
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,730
JANE: We cannot
afford this place.

706
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,450
AMY: Don't worry.
I've got a plan.

707
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,767
Shh. Get in here,
you idiots.
We totally snuck in.

708
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,002
I know! Shh.
I can't believe
you have a real job.

709
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,243
You're a lucky girl, Becky.
I would never do
this for my kid.

710
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,010
Yeah. My mom's
pretty cool.

711
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,168
Also, my name's Jane.

712
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,361
Okay.

713
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,283
All right. Showers on
the left. Have fun, guys.

714
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,885
Bye, Becky! Shh.
Okay, thanks, Carla.

715
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,081
This place is fancy.
Gosh.

716
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,330
Oh, look.
Free soap.

717
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,640
No, honey, don't take that.

718
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,563
(GASPS) Oh, no,
that's some good soap.
Take it, take it.

719
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,770
This is what the tub
looks like after your
brother takes a bath.

720
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,841
(BOTH LAUGHING)

721
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,284
You look like
Kung Fu Panda.
(LAUGHS)

722
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,641
(SIGHS)

723
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,400
This is amazing.

724
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,646
Mmm-hmm.

725
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,209
We should get
matching tattoos
after this.

726
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,561
(LAUGHS)

727
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,048
I'm really glad we did this, Mom.

728
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,885
I haven't felt this
relaxed in, like, ever.

729
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,484
God, you needed
a break from school
and soccer and...

730
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,044
(GRUNTS)
This whole Dad thing.

731
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,720
What whole Dad thing?

732
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,443
Nothing. Nothing!

733
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,729
(GASPS) Does Dad have a brain tumor?

734
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,167
What? No!
No, no, no, no.

735
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,049
God, no. Um...

736
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:53,287
Your dad and I
are going through
a rough patch right now.

737
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,445
Are you guys gonna get divorced?

738
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,851
What? No, no, no.

739
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:01,130
No. We're not getting
divorced right away.

740
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,287
I just want you to know
that no matter
what happens,

741
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,287
it's not your fault.

742
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,529
Why would it be my fault?

743
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,170
Why would you even say that?

744
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,241
I don't know!

745
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,250
Oh, my God, baby,
I'm so sorry!
I suck at this!

746
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,448
I just don't wanna be weird, okay?

747
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,040
Baby, please don't cry.
Please...
No, no, no, no, no.

748
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,447
Honey, I need you
to look at me,
just look at me, okay?

749
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,765
Baby, baby...

750
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,081
I need you to know
that your dad loves you.

751
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,090
That I love you.

752
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:35,246
And I promise you, you will be fine.

753
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,601
(SOBS)

754
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,526
How do you know?

755
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,011
Because I'm your mom,

756
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,651
and I know you better than anyone,

757
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,722
and I know what you're made of.

758
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,730
Oh, honey.

759
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,245
I love you.

760
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,450
I love you, too.

761
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,411
Hey, Coach?

762
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,481
Coach!

763
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,406
Fuck!

764
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,010
Hi, Gwendolyn.
Hi, how are you?

765
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,771
Listen, um, I wanna talk to you about

766
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,769
the starting lineup
of next week's game.
Mmm-hmm.

767
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,491
In particular,
Amy Mitchell's
daughter, Jane.

768
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,921
You know I can't discuss
specific players with you.

769
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,243
And you know that I chair the hiring

770
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,163
and firing committee, right?

771
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,608
So let's stop dicking
around and let's
get to the fucking point.

772
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,849
Please don't get me fired, Gwendolyn.

773
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,324
My cat just died.
Oh.

774
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,051
And I'm really very fragile right now.

775
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,365
Bench the little dork.

776
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,440
Yeah, she's fuckin' gone.

777
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,964
I need this. This is my time.
Do you know what I mean?

(EXHALES)

780
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,005
Go for Carla.
Hey, it's Amy,

781
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,327
I just found out
Mike is staying with
his Internet girlfriend.

782
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,966
Oh, fuck him!
We need to get you laid.

783
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,121
I wanna get laid.

784
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,201
I'm on my way.

785
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,811
I'm so excited.

786
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,484
CARLA: Honey,
I don't know,
what are you gonna wear?

787
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,561
It's like a nun's closet.

788
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,524
(GASPS) No, no, wait.
I got it, I got it.

789
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,244
Let's see this!

790
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,569
It's my favorite.

791
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,881
I love it.

792
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,322
No! No! Are you
trying to get laid
or adopted?

793
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,563
Oh.
Fair point.

794
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,641
Ooh.

795
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,001
Okay.

796
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,324
That's what a lonely
person gets buried in.

797
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,289
Fuck, you guys,
I literally have
nothing, then.

798
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,203
I have mom clothes, I have work clothes.

799
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,886
Okay, you know,
let me get in there
one more time.

800
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,689
I'm gonna find it.
Move. Move. Move, move,
get me in here.

801
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,683
I have jackets,
I have lots of 'em.
We'll find it.

802
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,211
We'll find
something, honey.
Don't get discouraged.

803
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,361
AMY: Okay. Okay.
You can do this.

804
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,010
I mean, Jesus Christ!

805
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,811
This is something that
Mrs. Doubtfire would wear.

806

I love that movie.

It's such a good film.

00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,004
Wait a minute, I see a spaghetti strap.

810
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,721
No, hold on. This was,
like, my slutty Halloween
costume from college.

811
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,370
I like the word "slutty."
Put it on.

812
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,851
Just try it.
Try it.

813
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,446
You guys are ridiculous.
I'm telling you...

814
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,211
Holy fuck!
Look at your mom bra!
Ooh.

815
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,687
There's so much surface area.

816
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,889
You can make
three regular bras
out of this one mom bra.

817
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,770
This isn't my mom bra.
This is my sexy bra.

(LAUGHS) Shut up!

819
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,125
Don't laugh.
Wait, are you serious?

Yes!

Oh, honey.
Amy.

822
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,168
Oh!
That looks like you
just got out of surgery.

823
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,446
Is it that bad?

824
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,171
Yeah, there's just
one boob-log.
Yeah.

825
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,810
You don't even have two tits.

826
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,168
I have this in black.
Do you guys wanna
see it in black?

827
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,441
No!
No!

828
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,843
Oh, wow.
This bra will be
the death of your vagina.

829
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,650
(ALL LAUGHING)

830
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,121
Oh!

AMY: Oh, my gosh.

832
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,842
You guys, I've only handled
one penis my entire life.

833
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,967
Oh, honey!

834
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,327
What do I do if I get
a guy with a weird dick?

835
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,851
Kent is a never-hard.

836
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,610
Ooh.
What's a never-hard?

837
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,523
Oh, he never gets fully hard.

838
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:50,248
So I just have to
kind of fold his penis up
like a balloon animal

839
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,163
and shove it up in my vagina.

840
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,528
That sounds horrible!
AMY: Yeah.

841
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,046
Sometimes I take the
balls and shove 'em
up there, too,

842
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,361
because at least, you know, they're firm.

843
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,603
Honey, that is
a lot of shit to
shove up your cooter.

844
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,682
I mean, I'm just happy he's circumcised.

845
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,320
(GASPS) What if I get
somebody who's
not circumcised?

846
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,209
Run out of the room screaming.

847
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,884
It's like finding a gun in the street.

848
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,724
Just scream and get outta there!

849
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,007
No way, you guys.
Uncut guys are great.

850
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,081
Really?

851
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,491
Oh, they're always so nice to you,

852
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,005
because they know their dicks are gross.

853
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,206
How do I handle it?

854
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,520
What, do I
just touch it?
Oh, I'll show you. Here.

855
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,443
Let me just,
Kiki, do you mind for a sec?
Uh-uh. What?

856
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,286
Just imagine for a second
that this is the hood
of the uncut cock

857
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,801
and then this is
the penis face. Okay?
Mmm-hmm.

858
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,121
So, what you would do is very gently,

859
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,524
you would just kind
of try to peel it back

860
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,805
over like that to
expose the head
of the cock.

861
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,281
Okay.
And then you
would just gently,

862
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,725
you wanna, I'm sorry,
honey, you just
wanna kind of,

863
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,001
like it gets a little tight,

864
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,525
and you gotta kind of work it,

865
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,204
you know, you gotta work it off.

866
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,681
And then you just
go to town like
it's a, you know...

867
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,729
(GRUNTS) You know, you jerk it off

868
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,926
till you wanna sit on it.

869
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,371
Okay?
What do I
do with this?

870
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,607
What?
Like, do I put it in
a hair clip or do I just...

871
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,284
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, this,

872
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,486
this you can flick it, suck it,

873
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,607
you know, rub your face on it.

874
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,444
I don't wanna do that.
I don't wanna
rub my face on it.

875
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,528
Okay, well, take care
of this, though.
Okay.

like a big,
giant man clit.

This, right here.

00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,802
If you work this, it's gonna be like...

make sense, honey?
Yeah, it's great.

00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,481
Okay. Sure, sure, sure.
Thank you, honey.

wear this sweatshirt
ever again.

all right. Let's get
right down to it.

885
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,967
What kind of guy are you into, honey?

886
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,449
(GASPS) You know what?
I've never been
with a Latin man.

887
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,290
If I were you, I would start with maybe

888
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,727
like just kind of fat and Jewish,

889
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,962
and then work
yourself into
the Latin guy.

890
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,451
Excuse me.
Okay.

891
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,086
Hi, there.
Hi!

892
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,161
Is this seat taken?

Um, yes.

I mean, yes, no,
like yes, sit, please. Yeah.

895
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,044
What do I do?
Ask him about his hobbies.

Um, I'm Amy.

Nice to meet you.
I like your

(STUTTERING) Okay, you see,
this is a funny story.

903
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,011
I was, um...
I was grocery shopping

904
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,526
and I found it on
the floor, and I
picked it up and...

905
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,160
And then I put it on.

906
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,450
I'm gonna
sit somewhere else.
Okay.

907
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,482
Ooh, maybe next time,
try it without
your wedding ring.

908
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,085
Oh, that's
a great idea!
Yeah?

comin' in from?

00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,764
Uh, we live in Westbury with our kids.

912
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,524
Great. Oh.

913
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,444
Oh, forget it.
I'm really nervous,
you guys.

914
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,760
You're doing great.
I know, I know. There is...

You're doing great.

917
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,286
Yeah.
...that if you
literally...

918
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,682
Just try to act
half-normal and
you are gonna get laid.

919
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,928
Just don't be
such a mom.
Okay.

920
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,365
You should eat more soup.

921
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,169
Oh, I loved breastfeeding
until my nipples
started cracking.

the stain from setting,
okay?

Does your mom know you're here?

926
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,288
See, it wasn't just
about a dolphin
getting a new tail.

927
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,567
It was about a family coming together.

928
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,841
What did I say?

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,967

Oh, horrible.

What's the matter, hon?
What happened?

934
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,405
I suck at this.
I just wanna go home.

935
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,481
Oh!

936
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,210
I really do.

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,281

doing here?

having a little
girls' night.

940

Cool, so the husband's
at home with the kids?
That's nice.

in the picture anymore.

with a dairy farmer.

(CHUCKLES) I don't know
where to start.
Are you okay?

946
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,601
I'm actually really,
really good. Yeah.

947
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,206
I'm glad I ran into you.
This is really nice.

948
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,845
Yeah, me too.

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,921
Me too.

950
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,730
Okay, creepy.
Let's go.

Let's go, creepy.
Yeah.

00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,201
Thank you. I think.

I cannot believe
Amy is talking to
Jessie Harkness.

I have dreams about him braiding my hair.

959
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,767
Okay, can you not stand so close to me?

960
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,967
Because I'm still trying to get laid.

961
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,445
Yeah, sure.
No problem.
Okay.

962
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,971
And don't dance walk.

963
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,807
You work at the, uh,
coffee company, right?

964
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,441
What? Yeah. Wait,
how did you know?

965
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,284
I might have asked around
about you a little bit.

966
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,041
Wait. You asked
about me?
Yeah.

967
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,201
Yeah, I...

968
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,560
Okay, I've kind of
always had a thing
for you and...

969
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,683
What?
I thought you knew that.

970
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,650
No! I had no idea.
No? You had no idea?

971
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,240
Oh, come on.
You're like my favorite
mom at the school.

972
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,970
I mean, I honestly
don't know
how you do it.

973
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,884
You take your kids
to all those activities,

974
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,405
and you do all those insane projects.

975
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,086
I saw your Richard
Nixon, by the way.
That was incredible.

976

Well, you know what?
I do have a little
thing for papier-mâché.

977
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,644
It was really good.
Thank you.

978
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,569
Oh, and are you kidding me
with those lunches?

979
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,971
You know, my daughter's always saying,

980
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,405
"Why can't you make lunch
like Dylan's mom?"

981
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,050
Oh, my God, I love your daughter.

982
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,764
You're making me
look bad.
Oh, my God.

983
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,605
Oh, this makes me
so happy. (CHUCKLES)

984
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,842
You know what's just
really amazing, though,

985
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,127
is the fact that your kids
are actually nice people.

986
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,601
Meh, eh...
No, no, I'm serious!

987
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,844
Anyone could force
their kids to play cello
or speak Chinese

988
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,281
or, you know,
go to a fancy college,
or something like that,

989
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,722
but what's really hard is raising kids

990
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,404
who are actually decent and kind

991
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,051
and somehow you've done that.

992
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,607
And you should be really proud.

993
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,330
You're a fuckin' great mom.

994
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,403
(GROANS) Oh, oh...

995
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,042
(CHUCKLING) Oh, my.
I'm so sorry.

996
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,128
It's fine.
Don't worry about it.
And I'm so embarrassed.

997
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:24,364
You kind of nailed my
face, but we should
probably do it again.

998
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,608
Are you sure?
Just no sudden
movements.

999
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,211
Just nice and slow.

Hey, babe!

1007
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,845
What are you doing?
I wanna get back together.

1008
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,083
I never should've left you.
That was a total dick move.

1009
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,362
And I feel like
we should just
put that in the past

1010
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,771
and not talk about it.

1011
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,647
Wait, what are you talking about?

1012
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,451
Look, I...

1013
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,845
I just needed a break.

1014
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,530
Haven't you ever needed a break?

1015
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,042
Of course I have, Mike.

1016
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,407
But I didn't break up
our family to do it.

1018
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,761

Jane a little bit, too.

1021

And the dog, God, I miss Roscoe so much.

1022
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,724
How is he doing?
He's fine.

1023
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,565
Thank God.
The bottom line is,

1024
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,405

it takes to keep
this family together.

You'll finally go to therapy with me?

gonna say that!

I will go to therapy.

about being a mom, though,

is you don't know
whether or not

01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,090
Wow. Hey.

1370
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:50,845
What are you doing here?

1371
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,324
Well, you kind of booty texted me.

1372
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:56,721
Uh...

1373
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:00,369
What?
It was a great party,
Am. So, uh...

1374
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,091
Okay.
You got
all this, right?

1375
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,083
Hi, Jessie.
I really like
your clothes.

1376
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,446
That was odd.

1377
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,041
(INAUDIBLE)
(CHUCKLES)
I'm so sorry.

1378
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,561
Um...

1379
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:15,884
I actually think Carla
may have booty texted you
off my phone.

1380
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,327
Oh, okay. (LAUGHS)
Okay, that makes sense

1381
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,529
because what she wrote
was fuckin' disturbing.

1382
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,523
Sorry.
It's okay.

1383
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,964
Um, I don't know.

1384
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,441
Should I leave?

1385
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:31,881
No.

1386
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,000
Uh...

1387
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,528
I was really hoping you'd say that.

1388
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,724
So what exactly did Carla text you?

1389
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,160
Why don't I show you?

1390
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,640
(GASPS) Oh.

1391
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,447
Okay.

1392
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,241
(GASPS)

1393
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,565
Oh, yes!

1394
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,361
(BOTH MOAN)

1395
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,685
AMY: Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
(JESSIE PANTING)

1396
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,005
Oh, that was...

1397
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,849
Unbelievable.
I can't...

1398
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,401
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)

1399
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,761
What was that...
Wow.

1400
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,285
That thing you did at the end?

1401
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,204
(LAUGHS)
I don't know.

1402
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,442
I kind of came up with it in the moment.

1403
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,567
Was it okay?

1404
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,364
Oh, my God,
it was amazing!
Yeah?

1405
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,926
That was by far
the best I've ever had.
Oh, God.

1406
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,451
Oh, I was so worried.

1407
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,170
You know, it's been
awhile since
I've done this.

1408
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,603
I think I got pregnant.
(LAUGHS)

1409
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:45,251
Oh, my God.
Really. Hey.

1410
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:48,250
Hi, yeah.
Can I go down
on you again?

1411
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,443
Oh, yeah, that'd be great.

1412
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:51,646
Cool.
Okay.

1413
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,529
Okay. Okay.
Oh, my God.

1414
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,569
Okay.
All right.

1415
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,681
Oh.
Mmm.

1416
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,043
(GASPS) Oh.

1417
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,884
Oh, look at you go.

1418
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,050
VICKY: God,
it's dark in here.

1419
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,564
(WHISPERING) God.
I still don't understand
what we're doing.

1420
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,246
Stop it.
You guys never
tell me what we're...

1421
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,922
GWENDOLYN:
Vicky, why are you
so fuckin' stupid?

1422
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:30,927
I like to start by saying
that every marriage
is savable.

1423
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,361
You just need two people
who are willing
to work at it.

1424
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:34,761
Okay?

1425
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,090
Mike, Amy, I want you
to look at each other

1426
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:41,926
and say three things
that you like
about each other.

1427
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,041
Mike?

1428
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,044
Can I go second?
Okay. Yeah, sure.

1429
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,930
Uh, Amy?

1430
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:54,768
Okay, uh, Mike,
I like that you
gave me my children.

1431
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,680
Uh, I like that you
pick them up
from school sometimes.

1432
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,127
It's actually really helpful.

1433
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:04,725
And, uh, I like that you
came to therapy today.

1434
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,448
Okay, Mike. Your turn.
MIKE: Okay.

1435
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,400
I like your spaghetti.

1436
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,848
And you make pretty good calzone.

1437
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:16,961
Was that three?

1438
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,921
That was like one and then 1A.

1439
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:25,801
You know what? Um...
Let's try some role playing.

1440
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,927
All right, Amy,
I want you to
pretend to be Mike,

1441
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:32,723
and Mike, I want you
to pretend to be Amy.

1442
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,248
Okay? And now
I just want you to

1443
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,687
just tell me about your day.

1444
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,211
(IN FALSETTO)
Hi, I'm Amy.

1445
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:45,805
All I did today was, like,
rub lotion on my face

1446
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:49,403
and talk, talk, talk, talk.

1447
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,606
Okay. Uh...

1448
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,608
Amy, would you like to...
Yes, I would!

1449
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,884
Hey, I'm Mike.

1450
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,321
Um...

1451
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:00,885
My life is awesome

1452
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,169
because my wife takes care
of everything
in the world for me.

1453
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,282
This is the problem!
Here's the bottom line!

1454
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,930
She's a perfectionist.

1455
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,161
So what's the point of even trying, okay?

1456
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,327
How is that a problem?

1457
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,925
And she hasn't given me a blowie

1458
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,604
since my birthday five years ago!

1459
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,489
Are you fucking
kidding me?
Which is so not cool!

1460
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:16,800
Hold on one second!

1461
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,166
You want a blowie?

1462
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,289
Maybe if you
cleaned the kitchen,
made the kids dinner,

1463
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,761
cared for someone other than yourself,

1464
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:24,921
I would give you so many blowies

1465
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,451
your fuckin' dick would explode.

1466
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,602
My dick would never explode
'cause it's indestructible.

1467
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:31,570
Oh, my God,
I can't deal with you!
I can't fucking look at you.

1468
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:32,641
I'm...

1469
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,885
Mike, I...

1470
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,450
I don't love you anymore.

1471
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:39,046
I'm so sorry, but I just don't.

1472
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,686
I'm so sick and tired
of pretending like I do.

1473
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:46,561
That is exactly how I feel.

1474
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,361
Okay...

1475
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:58,250
Remember when I said that
all marriages are savable?

1476
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,328
Well, it ain't gonna happen for you guys.

1477
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,404
So what do you think we should do?

1478
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,242
Well, as a therapist,
I'm not allowed
to tell you what to do,

1479
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:13,684
but as a human being
with two fuckin' eyes
in my head,

1480
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:17,930
yeah, I think you
should get divorced
as soon as possible.

1481
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:20,524
This is some catastrophic shit.

1482
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,645
I think it's for the best.

1483
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,606
Yeah. Me too.

1484
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,441
Can I give you a hug?

1485
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:59,809
Mike. I'm so sorry.

1486
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:03,806
I'm sorry, too.

1487
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,321
Mmm.

1488
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,247
You gotta watch out for you first.

1489
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:14,290
Dale, why is there
a security guard
in my office?

1490
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:15,851
Hey, Amy, uh, I'm so sorry,

1491
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,491
but we're gonna have to
positively transition you.

1492
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,050
Are you firing me?

1493
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:23,203
Yuck. Okay,
that's not my word.
I don't like that word.

1494
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:24,321
But, yes, I'm firing you.

1495
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,441
Why?

1496
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,284
Well, you quit coming to the office.

1497
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,489
Okay, maybe I've been
slacking off
a little bit, but...

1498
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:34,324
Tessa took two weeks off
when Jon Snow died
on Game of Thrones,

1499
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,447
and he's not even a real person.

1500
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,126
To be fair,
we all took two weeks off
when Jon Snow died.

1501
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,282
You're the only person
that didn't
take two weeks off.

1502
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,206
But as a token of appreciation

1503
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:43,645
for your six years with the company,

1504
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,609
I got you a very special gift.

1505
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,205
You got me
the four-ounce bag?

1506
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:51,964
Couldn't even splurge for the eight?

1507
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,445
(SHRIEKS)

1508
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,481
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

1509
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,401
What?

1510
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:07,330
PRINCIPAL BURR: Ms. Mitchell,
this is Principal Burr.
We need you to come in.

1511
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,323
Okay, okay.
I'll be right there,

1512
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,165
and I'm very sorry,
Principal, for how
I answered the phone.

1513
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,010
I'm sorry.
You found what?

1514
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:20,289
I found marijuana cigarettes
in your daughter's locker.

1515
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:23,011
Now, it looks like
Sour Diesel or
a little Afghan Kush.

1516
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,242
That's impossible.
She's only 12.

1517
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,045
It happens.
Snoop been smokin'
since he was five.

1518
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,321
Those aren't mine.

1519
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,323
I mean, Mom, I swear to God,
they're not mine.

1520
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,640
Baby, I believe you.

1521
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,722
And why were you looking
in my locker anyway?

1522
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:38,003
We were tipped off by a concerned parent.

1523
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,329
Wait a minute.

1524
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,846
Was this
concerned parent's name
Gwendolyn James?

1525
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,127
Hey, listen, I don't
know nothin' about
Gwendolyn James, all right?

1526
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:46,287
That woman scares me.

1527
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:49,842
What I do know
is this school is
a zero-tolerance school,

1528
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,160
so that means that your daughter's banned

1529
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:52,890
from all extra-curricular
activities.

1530
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,161
What does that mean?

1531
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:55,765
That means you're off the soccer team.

1532
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,126
What?

1533
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,282
Oh, my God.
Hey, my hands were tied.

1534
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,080
Honey, baby, hold on.

1535
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,967
That little girl rolls a real tight jay.

1536
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,690

1871
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,642
And I'm sorry for acting so crazy

1872
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:27,886
about the whole soccer thing.

1873
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,642
I'm really trying to chill out more.

1874
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,848
I mean, it's just
soccer. Right?

1875
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,050
I got you back on the soccer team.

1876
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,849
Shut up!
Shut up.

1877
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:39,048
Shut your face!
Oh, my God.

1878
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:40,531
Thank you so much, Mom.

01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,841
There. Oh, I love you guys
so much.

1881
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,490
You're amazing kids.

1882
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:51,289
I promise, I promise
to always be here for you.

1883
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:53,201

Oh...

1886
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:57,645
I almost forgot!
Where is he going?

1887
01:27:58,440 --> 01:27:59,646
Why is he touching the oven?

1888
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:04,210
DYLAN: I made a frittata.

1889
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:08,401
Did you just say "frittata"?

1890
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,005
You said you weren't
gonna cook for us
anymore,

1891
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:11,809
so I taught myself how to cook.

1892
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,282
Oh, honey, I'm so
proud of you!
Get in here. I love you.

01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,169
I love you.
Okay, okay,

Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:20,721
All right, okay, let go.

1896
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:22,604
Okay.
I gotta go
do my homework.

She said,
"Shut up and dance with me!"

Hey, Amy, it's Dale.

The company is
falling apart without you.
Could you please come back?

1908
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:54,769
I will give you whatever you want.

I wanna work from home two days a week.

three women over
the age of 12

Okay, okay, fine.
Anything you want.
Can you start today?

01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:18,169
Oh, no, no. No, sorry,
today's not good for me.

brought a great bottle of wine,

you know, made you a nice dinner,

1930

maybe ran you a hot bath
and someone just
took care of you...

What was that?
I said nothing.

I meant to say that I...

God, I would love that.
I would love that.

01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:36,446
I slept in late,
skipped my workout,
had, like, four donuts.

1942
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:37,646

I didn't even ask if
it was a boy or a girl.

"What's that?"

01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:38,810
And I looked around,
there was no Kathryn.

When I was nine years old,

2008
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:49,404
um, my mom
took me to see Cruising
in the theaters

2009
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:52,287

I loved Al Pacino.

investigating the
underworld of
S&M gay clubs

2012
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:00,970

a man murdering men
after raping them.

and you're like,
"Oh, they're fine,
they're fine,"

01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:07,840
and then you're in the hospital.

you lie to your kids,
of course you do,

2018
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:12,688
and you go
through their things.
You have to.

2019
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:14,125
You go through my things?

2020
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:16,726
Sometimes you have to make people happy,

2021
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,643
to lie a little bit.

2025
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:26,251
Yeah, well, that was a good idea anyway.

I would just be all, you know, upset

2028
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:33,206
because of the way
I thought that it had to be.

2029
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:36,011
You know,
I was so angry one day,
and I said to her,

2030
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:38,606
"Dominic doesn't like you,
Eric doesn't like you."

2031
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:40,489
You told me to fuck off.

2032
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,847
"Laura doesn't like you.
Your dad doesn't like you."

2033
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:44,649
You said, "Fuck you, Mom."
Or something like that.

2034
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:46,643
"I don't like you,
and the dog
doesn't like you."

(LAUGHING)

2036
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:49,689
Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking.

2037
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:53,324
I just really didn't have a clue about...

2038
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,482
You were perfect.
(LAUGHS)

2039
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:56,925
Yeah, it kind of worked out for her.

2040
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,048
It worked out perfectly.

2041
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:00,565
I had the best childhood.

2042
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:02,364
I loved my childhood.

2043
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:04,124
I had a very happy childhood.

2044
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:05,565
And we would have the best days.

2045
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:07,847
Yeah, it was absolutely like
some of the best
times of my life.

2046
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,285
You were an amazing mom.
(LAUGHING)

2047
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,169
Which is fine.
I feel good.

2048
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:13,322
It's nuts
being a mom, guys.
(BLOWS NOSE)

2049
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:16,245
Raising kids is an amazing experience.

2050
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:20,450
I did some mistakes,
but the end,
I can see it's not as bad.

2051
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:23,208
They survived.
In spite of us.

2052
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:25,243
Now, thank goodness...
(LAUGHS)

2053
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:29,644
You know, she turned out
to be the wonderful
woman that she is.

2054
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:31,131
I think she's perfect.

2055
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:35,681
The love that you had
when that kid was born,

2056
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:37,808
that you didn't have...
(SNIFFLES)

2057
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:39,644
It is a miracle.

2058
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:42,246
It's the wife that she is
and the mother that she is,

2059
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,209
and I'm really proud of just her.

2060
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,041
Mom.
Yeah.

2061
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:48,691
She's so good, like a mom.
She's so good.

2062
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,246
Yeah.
Thanks, Mommy.

2063
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,402
So I think
she's the best mom
in the world,

2064
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:55,723
and I go, "I wish,
you know, I'd been
more like that."

2065
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:56,801
Oh.

2066
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,006
I love you.
I love you, hon.

2067
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,127
I love you, Mommy.

2068
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:02,521
(LAUGHING)

2069
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:03,601
Aw.

2070
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:05,364
You said it would be fun, Kathryn.

2071
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:06,847
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

2072
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:07,967
Don't touch my makeup.

2073
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:09,371
See this shit?
(LAUGHING)
