1
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,742
Yare, yare!

2
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,503
Take in the topsail

3
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,342
Tend to the master's whistle!

4
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,426
Bestir, bestir!

5
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,865
Good Boatswain, have care

6
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,828
Where's the master?
Play the men

7
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,185
I pray now, keep below

8
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,261
Where is the master, bos'n?

9
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,783
Do you not hear him!?

10
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,147
You mar our labour,
keep your cabins

11
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,789
you do assist the storm

12
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,942
Nay, good, be patient

13
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,509
When the sea is

14
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,461
Good, yet remember
whom thou hast aboard

15
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,981
None that I more love than myself

16
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,061
Silence, trouble us not!

17
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,027
Out of our way, I say!

18
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,266
Yet again? What do you here?

19
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,739
Shall we give o'er, and drown?
Have you a mind to sink?

20
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:31,030
A pox o' your throat, you bawling,
blasphemous, incharitable dog!

21
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,987
Work you, then

22
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,905
Hang, cur, hang! You whoreson,
insolent noisemaker

23
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,789
we are less afraid
to be drowned than thou art

24
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,546
Off to sea again!
Lay her off!

25
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,989
Hell is empty and all the devils here!

26
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:33,466
If by your art, my dearest mother, you
have put the wild waters in this roar

27
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,830
allay them...

28
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,306
O, I have suffered with those that
I saw suffer

29
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,746
A brave vessel, who had, no doubt,
some noble creature in her

30
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,266
dash'd all to pieces

31
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,461
Poor souls, they perish'd!

32
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,698
Be collected
No more amazement

33
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,540
tell thy piteous heart there's no
harm done

34
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,782
- O, woe the day!
- No harm

35
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,265
I have done nothing but in care of thee,
of thee, my dear one, thee

36
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,343
my daughter, who art ignorant
of what thou art

37
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,706
nought knowing of whence I am

38
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,021
nor that I am more better than Prospera

39
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,866
master of a full poor cell
and thy no greater mother

40
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,830
More to know did never meddle
with my thoughts

41
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,707
'Tis time I should inform thee farther

42
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,069
So. Lie there, my art

43
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,865
Wipe thou thine eyes, have comfort

44
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,142
The direful spectacle of the wreck

45
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,818
which touch'd the very virtue
of compassion in thee

46
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,347
I have with such provision in mine art so
safely ordered that there is no soul

47
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,104
No, not so much perdition as an hair

48
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,347
betid to any creature in the vessel

49
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,186
which thou heard'st cry,
which thou saw'st sink

50
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,387
Sit down, and be attentive

51
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,941
Canst thou remember a time
before we came unto this cell?

52
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,988
I do not think thou canst, for then thou
wast not out three years old

53
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,583
Certainly, ma'am, I can

54
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,182
By what? By any other
house or person?

55
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,379
Of any thing the image tell me that hath
kept with thy remembrance

56
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,940
'Tis far off, and rather like a dream

57
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,705
Had I not Four or five women
once that tended me?

58
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,467
Thou hadst, and more, Miranda

59
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:03,421
Twelve year since, Miranda,
twelve year since

60
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,909
thy mother held the Dukedom
of Milan and its princely power

61
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,140
But are not you my mother?

62
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:16,210
The very same, who long ago was wife
to him who ruled Milan most liberally

63
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,662
who, with as tolerant a hand toward me

64
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,903
gave license to my long hours
in pursuit of hidden truths

65
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:31,970
of coiled powers contained within
some elements to harm, or heal

66
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,698
I brooked no interruption
but your squalling

67
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,987
for thou, child, art a princess born

68
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,106
O, Heavens!

69
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,307
What foul play had we, that we
came from thence?

70
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:53,465
Upon thy father's death, authority was
conferred as was his will to me alone

71
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:59,530
thereby awaking the ambitions of my
brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio

72
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,145
- Thou attendst not...
- Good Madam, I do!

73
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:09,210
I pray thee, mark me
that a brother should be so perfidious!

74
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,668
He whom I did charge to execute
express commands

75
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,901
as to the prudent
governing of fair Milan

76
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,699
instead undid, subverted
Dost thou attend me?

77
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,823
Ma'am, most heedfully!

78
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,788
Perverting my upstanding studies

79
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:29,785
now his slandering and bile-dipped
brush did paint a faithless portrait

80
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,862
His sister, a practicer of the black arts!

81
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,066
A demon, not a woman, nay a witch!

82
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,745
And he full-knowing others of
my sex have burned for no less!

83
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:42,744
The flames now fanned, my counselors
turned against me. Dost thou hear?

84
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,628
Your tale, ma'am, would cure deafness

85
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,020
To credit his own lie he did
believe he was indeed the Duke

86
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,546
confederates wi' the King of
Naples to give him annual tribute

87
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,908
and bend my Dukedom yet unbow'd
to most ignoble stooping

88
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,270
O the heavens!

89
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,663
Now the condition

90
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,664
The King of Naples, being an enemy
to me inveterate

91
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,468
hearkens my brother's suit

92
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:14,464
which was, that he, should presently
eradicate me and mine

93
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,626
out of the dukedom

94
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:21,227
and confer fair Milan with
all its honours upon my brother

95
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:26,987
whereon, one midnight

96
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,108
did Antonio open the gates of Milan

97
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:34,866
and, i' the dead of darkness his
ministers for the purpose hurried thence

98
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,262
me and thy crying self

99
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,861
Wherefore did they not
that hour destroy us?

100
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,744
Dear, they durst not

101
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,468
so dear the love my people bore me

102
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,508
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark
bore us some leagues to sea

103
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,026
where they prepared a rotten
carcass of a boat

104
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,706
not rigg'd, nor tackle, sail, nor mast

105
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,425
the very rats instinctively had quit it

106
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:10,223
there they hoist us to cry
to the sea that roar'd to us

107
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:15,783
to sigh to the winds whose pity sighing
back again, did us but loving wrong

108
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,226
Alack, what trouble was I then to you!

109
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:24,305
O, a cherubim thou wast
that did preserve me!

110
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:28,258
Thou didst smile
Infused with a fortitude from heaven

111
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,785
that raised in me
an undergoing stomach

112
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,709
to bear up against what should ensue

113
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,543
- How came we ashore?
- By providence divine

114
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,866
Some food we had
and some fresh water

115
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,500
that a noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo

116
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,788
out of his charity, did give us, with rich
garments, stuffs and necessaries

117
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,908
which since have steaded much

118
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,858
Of his gentleness,
knowing I loved my books

119
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,669
he furnish'd me from mine own
library with volumes

120
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,667
that I prize above my dukedom

121
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,947
Would I might but ever see that man!

122
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,029
I pray you, ma'am

123
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,102
for still 'tis beating in my mind, your
reason for raising this sea-storm?

124
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,824
By accident most strange

125
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:18,508
bountiful fortune now my dear lady, hath
mine enemies brought to this shore

126
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,228
Here cease more questions

127
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:26,582
Thou art inclined to sleep
'Tis a good dulness, and give it way

128
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,708
I know thou canst not choose

129
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,141
Come away, servant, come

130
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:44,748
I am ready now
Approach, my Ariel, come

131
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,064
All hail, great master!
Grave dame, hail!

132
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:57,267
I come to answer thy best pleasure

133
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:02,379
be't to fly, to swim, to dive into the fire

134
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,825
to ride on the curl'd clouds

135
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:10,890
to thy strong bidding task Ariel
and all his quality

136
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:15,104
Hast thou, spirit, perform'd, to point,
the tempest that I bade thee?

137
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,860
To every article
I boarded the King's ship

138
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,103
Now on the beak, now in the
waist, the deck, in every cabin

139
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:27,469
I flamed amazement; sometime I'd
divide and burn in many places

140
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:31,020
the fire and cracks of sulphurous roaring
the most mighty Neptune

141
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:35,587
seem to besiege
and make his bold waves tremble

142
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,548
yea, his dread trident shake

143
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,348
Hi ho!

144
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,468
My brave spirit!

145
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:47,418
Who was so firm, so constant, that
this coil would not infect his reason?

146
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:52,459
Not a soul but felt a fever of the mad
and play'd some tricks of desperation

147
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:56,828
The king's son Ferdinand, with hair
up-staring was the first man that leap'd

148
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,825
cried; Hell is empty
and all the devils here!

149
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:06,302
Why that's my spirit!
But was not this nigh shore?

150
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,746
- Close by, my master
- But are they, Ariel, safe?

151
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,744
Not a hair perish'd

152
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,459
On their sustaining garments
not a blemish

153
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,269
but fresher than before

154
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:25,226
and, as thou badest me, in troops I have
dispersed them 'bout the isle

155
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,427
The King's son have I landed by himself

156
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,468
whom I left cooling of the air
with sighs

157
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:37,182
in an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
his arms in this sad knot

158
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,865
Of the King's ship, the mariners,
say how thou hast disposed

159
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:45,865
Safely in harbour is the King's ship
in the deep nook, there she's hid

160
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:50,182
the mariners all under hatches stow'd,
who, with a charm, I have left asleep

161
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,786
Ariel, thy charge exactly is perform'd

162
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,588
but there's more work
What is the time o' the day?

163
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,624
- Past the mid season
- At least two glasses

164
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:02,749
The time 'twixt six and now must by
us both be spent most preciously

165
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,184
Is there more toil?

166
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,345
Since thou dost give me pains let me
remember thee what thou hast promised

167
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,102
which is not yet perform'd me

168
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:17,210
How now? Moody?
What is't thou canst demand?

169
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,662
My liberty

170
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,185
Before the time be out? No more!

171
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,228
I prithee, remember
I have done thee worthy service

172
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,898
thou didst promise to bate me a full year

173
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,188
Dost thou forget from what
a torment I did free thee?

174
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,348
- No
- Thou dost

175
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,262
- I do not, ma'am
- Thou liest, malignant thing!

176
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,147
Hast thou forgot the foul witch Sycorax

177
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,865
hast thou forgot her?

178
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,100
- No, ma'am
- Thou hast

179
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,908
Where was she born? Speak! Tell me

180
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,503
Ma'am, in Algiers

181
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,583
O, was she so?

182
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:59,220
I must once in a month recount what
thou hast been, which thou forget'st

183
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,823
This damn'd witch Sycorax

184
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,466
for mischiefs manifold and sorceries
terrible to enter human hearing

185
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,383
from Algiers, thou know'st,
was banish'd Is not this true?

186
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,549
Ay, ma'am

187
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,018
This blue-eyed hag was
hither brought with child

188
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,545
and here was left by the sailors

189
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:17,259
Thou, my slave, as thou report'st
thyself, wast then her servant

190
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:22,026
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate to
act her earthy and abhorr'd commands

191
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,307
she did confine thee into a cloven pine

192
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:30,100
within which rift imprison'd thou didst
painfully remain a dozen years

193
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,148
within which space she died
and left thee there

194
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,586
thou best knows what a torment
I did found thee

195
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,469
thy groans did make wolves howl

196
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,418
and penetrate the breasts
of ever angry bears

197
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,823
It was mine art,
when I arrived and heard thee

198
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,504
that made gape the pine,
and let thee out

199
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,022
I thank thee, master

200
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:00,739
If thou more murmur'st I will rend an oak

201
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:06,348
and peg thee in his knotty entrails till
thou hast howl'd away twelve winters

202
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,748
Pardon, master

203
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,901
I will be correspondent to the command

204
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:27,029
- and do my spiriting gently
- Do so

205
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:32,219
and after two days I will discharge thee

206
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,985
That's my noble master!

207
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:41,308
What shall I do? Say what?
What shall I do?

208
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:45,019
Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea

209
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,149
Be subject to no sight but thine or mine,
invisible to every eyeball else

210
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,426
Go! Hence with diligence!

211
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,107
Awake, dear heart, awake!

212
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,979
Thou hast slept well. Awake!

213
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,504
The strangeness of your story put
heaviness in me

214
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,979
Shake it off. Come on

215
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,869
We'll visit with Caliban, my slave

216
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,864
who never yields us kind answer

217
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,909
'Tis a villain, ma'am,
I do not love to look on

218
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,545
But, as 'tis, we cannot miss him

219
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,941
He does make our fire,
fetches in our wood

220
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,068
and serves in offices that profit us

221
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,302
What, ho! Slave!

222
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:55,103
Caliban! Thou earth, thou! Speak

223
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:59,661
- There's wood enough within!
- Come forth, I say!

224
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,742
I must eat my dinner

225
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:12,186
There's other business for thee.
Come, thou tortoise! When?

226
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,782
Thou poisonous slave, got by the
devil himself upon thy wicked dam

227
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,180
Come forth!

228
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,540
As wicked dew as e'er my mother

229
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:44,023
brush'd with raven's feather from
unwholesome fen drop on you both!

230
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,866
A south-west blow on ye
and blister you all o'er!

231
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,908
For this, be sure, to-night thou
shalt have cramps

232
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,664
side-stitches that shall pen
thy breath up

233
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:00,298
Urchins shall work all exercise on thee

234
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,825
thou shalt be pinch'd as thick as
honeycomb

235
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,778
each pinch more stinging
than bees that made 'em

236
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:11,905
This island is mine by Sycorax my
mother, which thou tak'st from me

237
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:18,745
When thou camest first, thou strok'st
me and madest much of me

238
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,665
wouldst give me water with berries in't

239
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,424
and teach me how to
name the bigger light

240
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,946
and how the less,
that burn by day and night

241
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:34,970
And then I loved thee and show'd
thee all the qualities o' th' isle

242
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:41,570
the fresh springs, brine-pits
barren place and fertile

243
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,943
Cursed be I that did so!

244
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:51,170
All the charms of Sycorax toads,
beetles, bats, light on you!

245
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:57,450
For I am all the subjects that you have,
which first was mine own king

246
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,269
and here you sty me in this hard rock

247
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:04,581
whiles you do keep from me
the rest o' th' island

248
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,459
Thou most lying slave, whom
stripes may move, not kindness!

249
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:13,146
I have used thee, with humane care,
lodged thee in mine own cell

250
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,541
till thou didst seek to violate
the honour of my child

251
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,423
Would't had been done!

252
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,742
Thou didst prevent me: I had peopled
else this isle with Calibans

253
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,502
Abhorred slave

254
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,339
which any print of goodness
wilt not take

255
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,827
I pitied thee

256
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,708
took pains to make thee speak

257
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:41,149
You taught me language, and my
profit on't is, I know how to curse

258
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,699
The red plague rid you for
learning me your language!

259
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,782
Hagseed, hence!

260
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,704
Fetch us in fuel. Shrug'st thou, malice?

261
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:54,182
If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly what
I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps

262
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:59,629
fill all thy bones with aches, make thee
roar that beasts shall tremble at thy din

263
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,668
No, pray thee

264
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,419
I must obey. Her art is of such power

265
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,421
So, slave: hence!

266
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:51,370
Come unto these darkened sands

267
00:20:54,910 --> 00:21:00,810
and then take hands

268
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:09,370
Curtsied when you have and kiss'd

269
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:17,490
the wild waves whist

270
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:22,866
foot it featly here and there

271
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:27,660
and, sweet sprites, the burden bear

272
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:32,381
Hark, hark! The watchdogs bark!

273
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:37,385
Hark, hark! The watchdogs bark!

274
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,905
Where should this music be?

275
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,380
I' th' air or th' earth?

276
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,988
It sounds no more: and sure,
it waits upon some god o' th' island

277
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:54,468
Thence I have follow'd it,
or it hath drawn me rather

278
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:59,144
but 'tis gone

279
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,458
No, it begins again

280
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:15,250
Full fathom five thy father lies

281
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:22,610
of his bones are coral made

282
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:29,250
Those are pearls that were his eyes

283
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:35,508
nothing of him that doth fade

284
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:42,650
but doth suffer a sea change

285
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:53,090
into something rich

286
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:59,262
and strange

287
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:04,740
The ballard does remember
my drown'd father

288
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:09,825
This is no mortal business, nor no
sound that the earth owes

289
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,220
I hear it now above me

290
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,505
The fringed curtains of thine eye
advance and say...

291
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,264
say what thou seest yond

292
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,430
What is't? A spirit?

293
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:47,490
No, child: it eats and sleeps and hath
such senses as we have, such

294
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:52,101
This gallant which thou seest
was in the wreck

295
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:58,170
I might call him a thing divine, for
nothing natural I ever saw so noble

296
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:07,147
It goes on, I see, as my soul prompts it

297
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:11,185
Oh spirit, fine spirit! I'll free
thee within two days for this

298
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:18,819
Most sure, the goddess on whom
these airs attend!

299
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,504
Vouchsafe my prayer may know if
you remain upon this island

300
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:25,629
and that you will some good instruction
give how I may bear me here

301
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:29,108
My prime request, which I
do last pronounce, is

302
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,550
O you wonder!

303
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,699
If you be maid or no?

304
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,828
No wonder, sir, but certainly a maid

305
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:41,306
My language! Heavens!

306
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,344
I am the best of them
that speak this speech

307
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,070
were I but where 'tis spoken

308
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,790
How? The best?

309
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,067
What wert thou, if the King
of Naples heard thee?

310
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:57,382
A single thing, as I am now, that
wonders to hear thee speak of Naples

311
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,388
He does hear me
and that he does I weep

312
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,586
myself am Naples

313
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:09,620
who with mine eyes, never since at ebb
beheld the King my father wreck'd

314
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,224
Alack, for mercy!

315
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:15,541
Yes, faith, and all his lords

316
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,579
At the first sight they have
changed eyes

317
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:27,429
Delicate Ariel,
I'll set thee free for this

318
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,702
A word, good sir

319
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,502
I fear you have done yourself
some wrong. A word!

320
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,900
Why speaks my mother so ungently?

321
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:40,188
This is the second man that e'er I saw,
the first that e'er I sigh'd for

322
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:44,267
They are both in either's powers

323
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,226
but this swift business
I must uneasy make

324
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:50,746
lest too light winning make the prize light

325
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,550
One word more

326
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,985
I charge thee that thou attend me

327
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,984
Thou dost here usurp
the name thou ow'st not

328
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:04,301
and hast put thyself
upon this island as a spy

329
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,779
to win it from me, the sovereign on't

330
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:07,909
No, as I am a man

331
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,821
There's nothing ill can dwell in
such a temple

332
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:13,027
Follow me. Speak not you for him:
he's a traitor

333
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,750
Come! I'll manacle thy neck
and feet together

334
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,026
sea-water shalt
thou drink. Follow!

335
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,148
No. I will resist such entertainment
till mine enemy has more pow'r

336
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:25,349
O dear mother, make not too rash a trial
of him, for he's gentle and not fearful

337
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:28,502
What, I say, my foot my tutor?
Put thy sword up, traitor

338
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,749
For I can here disarm thee with this
stick and make thy weapon drop

339
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,708
- Beseech you, mother
- Hence! Hang not on my garments

340
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:37,065
Ma'am, have pity. I'll be his surety

341
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:41,223
Silence! One word more shall make
me chide thee, if not hate thee

342
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,218
Thou think'st there is no more
such shapes as he

343
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,421
having seen but him and Caliban

344
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,818
Foolish child!

345
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,823
To th' most of men this is a Caliban
and they to him are angels

346
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:57,018
My affections are then most humble
I have no ambition to see a goodlier man

347
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,340
Come on, obey!

348
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,983
Thy nerves are in their infancy
again and have no vigour in them

349
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,903
So they are

350
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:11,586
My spirits, as in a dream,
are all bound up

351
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:15,228
My father's loss, the weakness
which I feel

352
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,749
the wreck of all my friends, nor this
dame's threats, to whom I am subdued

353
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,788
are but light to me

354
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:25,938
might I but through my prison
once a day behold this maid

355
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:29,267
All corners else o' the earth
let liberty make use of

356
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,218
Space enough have I in such a prison

357
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,342
It works

358
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,542
Come on

359
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:57,984
Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!
Hark what thou else shalt do me

360
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:04,019
Be of comfort. My mother's of a better
nature, sir, than she appears by speech

361
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,186
Thou shalt be free as mountain winds

362
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:11,503
then exactly do all points
of my command

363
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,262
To th' syllable

364
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,741
Come, follow. Speak not for him

365
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:43,544
Beseech you, sir, be merry

366
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:47,146
you have cause, so have we all, of joy

367
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:52,510
for our escape is much beyond our loss

368
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,461
But for the miracle,
I mean our preservation

369
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,939
few in millions can speak like us

370
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:03,023
Then wisely, good sir, weigh our
sorrow with our comfort

371
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:06,819
- Prithee, peace
- He receives comfort like cold porridge

372
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:11,381
Look he's winding up the watch of
his wit: by and by it will strike

373
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:15,065
- Sir
- One... Tell

374
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:19,383
When every grief is entertain'd
that's offer'd

375
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:23,225
- comes to the entertainer
- A dollar

376
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:27,349
Dolour comes to him, indeed. You have
spoken truer than you purposed

377
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,707
You have taken it wiselier
than I meant you should

378
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,349
Therefore, my lord...

379
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,978
Fie, what a spendthrift is he
of his tongue!

380
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:38,347
- I prithee, spare
- Well...

381
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,383
I have done

382
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:45,109
- But yet...
- He will be talking!

383
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:49,822
Though this island seem to be desert

384
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,379
- Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible
- Yet...

385
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:55,189
- Yet
- He could not miss't

386
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:58,387
The air breathes upon us here
most sweetly

387
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,268
As if it had lungs, and rotten ones

388
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,307
Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen

389
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,779
Here is everything advantageous to life

390
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,383
True: save means to live

391
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,188
Of that there's none, or little

392
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:13,185
How lush and lusty the grass
looks! How green!

393
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,705
The ground indeed is tawny

394
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:20,228
With an eye of green in't

395
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:25,221
But the rarity of it is, which is
indeed almost beyond credit

396
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,348
that our garments, being,
as they were, drenched in the sea

397
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:31,741
are now as fresh as when
we put them on first in Afric

398
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,625
In Tunis

399
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:40,147
At the marriage of your fair daughter
Claribel to the King of Tunis

400
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:44,303
You cram these words into mine ears
against the stomach of my sense

401
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:49,464
Would I had never married my daughter
there! For, coming thence, my son is lost

402
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,830
and, in my rate, she too

403
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:54,744
who is so far from Italy removed
I ne'er again shall see her

404
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,104
O thou mine heir of Naples and of Milan

405
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:01,263
what strange fish hath made
his meal on thee

406
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,909
Sir, he may live

407
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:07,103
I saw him beat the surges under him,
and ride upon their backs

408
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:11,263
- I not doubt he came alive to land
- No, no, he's gone

409
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:14,740
Sir, you may thank yourself
for this great loss

410
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,901
that would not bless our Europe
with your daughter

411
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,901
but rather lose her to an African

412
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,270
Prithee, peace

413
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,944
We have lost your son, I fear, for ever
The fault's your own

414
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:26,022
So is the dear'st o' the loss

415
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:32,186
My lord Sebastian, the truth you
speak doth lack some gentlenes

416
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:35,104
You rub the sore, when you should
bring the plaster

417
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,865
- Very well
- And most like a surgeon

418
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:43,585
It is foul weather in us all, good
sir, when you are cloudy

419
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,940
Foul weather?

420
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,308
Very foul

421
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:04,462
Prospera! Prospera!

422
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:16,130
All the infections that the sun
sucks up from bogs, fens, flats

423
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:20,469
on Prospera fall and make her by
inchmeal a disease!

424
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:28,022
Her spirits hear me

425
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,901
And yet I needs must curse

426
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:38,745
But for every trifle are they set upon me

427
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,260
sometime like apes

428
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:44,103
that mow

429
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:52,660
and chatter at me and after bite me

430
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:57,984
then like hedgehogs which lie
tumbling in my barefoot way

431
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:03,383
and mount their pricks at my footfall

432
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:07,020
Sometime... am I all wound...

433
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:13,090
with adders who with cloven tongues
do hiss me into madness!

434
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,668
Lo! Here comes a spirit of hers

435
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,708
and to torment me for bringing
wood in slowly

436
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:56,942
I'll fall flat. Perchance he will
not mind me

437
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:13,665
Here's neither bush nor shrub,
to bear off any weather at all

438
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:16,708
and another storm brewing

439
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,542
I hear it sing i' the wind

440
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:24,462
Yond same black cloud, yond huge one

441
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:30,023
looks like a foul bombard that
would shed his liquor

442
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:36,658
If it should thunder as it did before

443
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,900
I know not where to hide my head

444
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:43,388
Yond same cloud cannot choose
but fall by pailfuls

445
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,141
What have we here?

446
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:51,268
A man or a fish?

447
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:53,386
Dead or alive?

448
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,578
A fish! He smells like a fish

449
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,743
a very ancient fishlike smell

450
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,986
A strange fish!

451
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:16,504
Were I in England now, as once I was

452
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:19,230
and had but this fish painted

453
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:23,144
not a holiday fool there
but would give a piece of silver

454
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:27,901
There would this monster make a man

455
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,742
any strange beast there makes a man

456
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,140
When they will not give a penny
to relieve a lame beggar

457
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:36,861
they will lay out ten to see
a dead Indian

458
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,700
Legged...

459
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:46,180
like a man...

460
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:51,378
and his fins like arms!

461
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:56,146
Warm o' my troth!

462
00:35:56,310 --> 00:36:01,338
I do now let loose my opinion,
hold it no longer

463
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:05,506
This is no fish

464
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:10,869
but an islander, that hath lately
suffered by a thunderbolt

465
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:15,063
Alas, the storm is come again!

466
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:19,906
My best way is to creep
under his gaberdine

467
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:23,142
there is no other shelter hereabouts

468
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:31,504
Misery acquaints a man with
strange bedfellows

469
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:43,268
Do not torment me! O!

470
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:49,063
The master, the swabber,
the boatswain and I

471
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,790
the gunner and his mate

472
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:58,090
loved Mall, Meg and Marian
and Margery

473
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,223
but none of us cared for Kate

474
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,381
for she had a tongue with a tang

475
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:06,508
would cry to a sailor, Go hang!

476
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:10,822
She loved not the savour
of tar nor of pitch

477
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:13,902
yet...

478
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:18,823
yet a tailor might scratch her

479
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,629
where'er she did itch

480
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:27,268
then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!

481
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:32,982
Then to sea, boys, and let her

482
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:38,785
This is a very scurvy tune to sing
at a mans funeral

483
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:45,065
Well, here's my comfort

484
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,467
What's the matter?

485
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,900
Have we devils here?

486
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:03,109
Do you put tricks upon's with
savages and men of Inde, ha?

487
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:09,582
I have not scaped drowning to be
afeard now of your four legs

488
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:14,468
The spirit torments me. O!

489
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,461
This is some monster of the isle
with four legs

490
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,269
who hath got, as I take it, an ague

491
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,069
Where the devil should he learn
our language?

492
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:26,305
I will give him some relief
if it be but for that

493
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:29,138
If I can recover him, and keep him
tame and get to Naples with him

494
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,823
he's a present for any emperor

495
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:35,629
Do not torment me, prithee
I'll bring my wood home faster

496
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:39,100
He's in his fit now and does not
talk after the wisest

497
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,344
He shall taste of my bottle
Come on your ways

498
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:49,530
Open your mouth. This will shake your
shaking I can tell you, and that soundly

499
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:55,820
You cannot tell who's your friend
Open your chaps again

500
00:38:55,990 --> 00:39:00,984
I should know that voice! It should be...
but he is drowned: and these are devils

501
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,350
O, defend me

502
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,747
Four legs and two voices a most
delicate monster!

503
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,263
Come

504
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:14,264
Amen! I will pour some
in thy other mouth

505
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:17,228
Stephano!

506
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,028
Doth thy other mouth call me?

507
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:22,620
Mercy, mercy! This is a devil,
and no monster I will leave him

508
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:26,465
Stephano! If thou beest Stephano,
touch me and speak to me

509
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:31,181
be not afeard, for I am Trinculo,
thy good friend Trinculo

510
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:34,262
If thou beest Trinculo, come forth

511
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:37,024
I'll pull thee by the lesser legs

512
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:40,662
If any be Trinculo's legs, these are they

513
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:46,180
Thou art very Trinculo indeed!

514
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:50,218
How camest thou to be the siege of this
mooncalf? Can he vent Trinculos?

515
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:53,268
I took him to be killed with
a thunder-stroke

516
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,660
But art thou not drowned, Stephano?

517
00:39:55,870 --> 00:40:00,148
I hid me under the dead moon-calfs
gaberdine for fear of the storm

518
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:03,188
And art thou living, Stephano?

519
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:07,263
O Stephano, two Neapolitans 'scaped!

520
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:13,509
Prithee, do not turn me about
my stomach is not constant

521
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:17,346
These be fine things,
an if they be not sprites

522
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:21,822
That's a brave god and bears
celestial liquor

523
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,548
I will kneel to him

524
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:26,941
How didst thou 'scape?
How camest thou hither?

525
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,941
Swear by this bottle
how thou cam'st hither

526
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:33,110
I escaped upon a butt of sack
which the sailors heaved o'erboard

527
00:40:33,145 --> 00:40:37,900
I'll swear upon that bottle
to be thy true subject

528
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,538
for the liquor is not earthly

529
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,144
Here! Swear by this bottle
how thou escapedst

530
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:46,985
Swum ashore, man, like a duck
I can swim like a duck, I'll be sworn

531
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,823
Here, kiss the book

532
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:53,586
Though thou canst swim like a
duck, thou art made like a goose

533
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:57,459
O Stephano. Hast thou any
more of this?

534
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,310
The whole butt, man

535
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:04,869
How now, mooncalf!

536
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,261
How does thine ague?

537
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,862
Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?

538
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:16,219
Out o' th' moon, I do assure thee

539
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,507
I was the Man i' the Moon
when time was

540
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:22,339
I have seen thee in her

541
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,944
and I do adore thee

542
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:27,670
Come, swear to that

543
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,259
Kiss the book. Swear

544
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:37,943
By this good light, this is a very
shallow monster!

545
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:41,659
I afeard of him? A very weak monster!

546
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:46,699
The Man i' the Moon! A most poor
credulous monster!

547
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:53,050
I'll show thee every fertile inch
o' th' island

548
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,948
And I will kiss thy foot

549
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,622
I prithee, be my god

550
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,779
Come on then
Down, and swear!

551
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:11,026
I shall laugh myself to death
at this puppy-headed monster

552
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,545
A most scurvy monster!

553
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,860
I could find in my heart to beat him

554
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:21,825
- But that the poor monster's in drink
- Come, kiss

555
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:34,299
I'll show thee the best springs

556
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:38,022
I'll pluck thee berries

557
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:43,065
I'll fish for thee
and get thee wood enough

558
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:47,144
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
I'll bear her no more sticks

559
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:50,427
but follow thee thou wondrous man

560
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:55,744
A most ridiculous monster
to make a wonder of a poor drunkard!

561
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:58,868
I prithee, let me bring thee
where crabs grow

562
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:03,782
and I with my long nails will dig
thee pignuts

563
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:05,986
show thee a jay's nest

564
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,699
and instruct thee how to snare
the nimble marmoset

565
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,588
I'll bring thee to clust'ring filberts

566
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:18,107
and sometimes I'll get thee young
scamels from the rock

567
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,470
Wilt thou go with me?

568
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:23,065
I prithee now, lead the way without
any more talking, Trinculo

569
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:27,269
The King and all our company else
being drowned, we will inherit here

570
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:30,900
Farewell master: farewell, farewell!

571
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:33,982
A howling monster!
A drunken monster!

572
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,618
No more dams I'll make for fish

573
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:39,827
nor fetch in firing at requiring

574
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:43,619
nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish

575
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:47,544
'Ban, 'Ban
Ca- Ca- Ca- Ca- Caliban

576
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:50,588
has a new master

577
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:52,388
Get a new man!

578
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:56,668
Freedom, high day!
High day, freedom!

579
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,499
Freedom, high day,
high day freedom!

580
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:03,265
O brave monster! Lead the way

581
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:40,901
This my mean task
would be as heavy to me as odious

582
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:44,619
but the mistress which I serve
quickens what's dead

583
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:48,419
and makes my labours... pleasures

584
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,899
She is ten times more gentle than
her mother's crabbed

585
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:59,188
and she's composed of harshness!

586
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:02,467
I must remove some thousands
of these logs

587
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:06,225
and pile them up,
upon a sore injunction

588
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:12,182
My sweet mistress weeps
when she sees me work

589
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:16,300
and says, such baseness
had never like executor

590
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:23,985
I forget: but these sweet thoughts
do even refresh my labours

591
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,584
most busiest, when I do work

592
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:47,259
Alas, now, pray you, work not so hard!

593
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:51,105
I would the lightning had burnt up those
logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!

594
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:53,579
Pray, set it down and rest you

595
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:57,586
When this burns, 'twill weep
for having wearied you

596
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,820
My mother is hard at study

597
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:02,106
pray now, rest yourself
she's safe for these three hours

598
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:03,942
O most dear mistress, the sun will set

599
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:05,987
before I shall discharge
what I must strive to do

600
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:08,027
If you'll sit down, I'll bear your
logs the while

601
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:10,269
Pray, give me that: I'll carry it to the pile

602
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:14,025
No, precious creature, I had rather
crack my sinews, break my back

603
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,784
than you should such dishonour
undergo, while I sit lazy by

604
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:18,383
It would become me as well
as it does you

605
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:20,188
and I should do it with much more ease

606
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:25,743
for my good will is to it,
and yours it is against

607
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:33,950
You look wearily

608
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:38,668
No, noble mistress 'tis fresh morning
with me when you are by at night

609
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:43,029
I do beseech you, what is your name?

610
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:47,149
Miranda. O my mother,
I have broke your hest to say so!

611
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,666
Admired Miranda!

612
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:54,381
Indeed the top of admiration!
Worth what's dearest to the world!

613
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:59,749
Poor worm, thou art infected!
This visitation shows it

614
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:03,268
Full many a lady I have eyed
with best regard

615
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:05,785
and many a time the harmony of their
tongues hath into bondage brought

616
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:07,150
my too diligent ear

617
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:10,588
For several virtues have I liked
several women

618
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:14,299
never any with so full soul

619
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:17,746
but some defect in her did quarrel
with the noblest grace she owed

620
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:20,344
and put it to the foil

621
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:21,750
But you...

622
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:29,144
O you, so perfect and so peerless

623
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:33,062
are created of every creature's best!

624
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:37,348
I know only one more of my sex
no young woman's face remember

625
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:40,547
save from my glass, mine own
nor have I seen

626
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:43,941
more that I may call men than you,
good friend

627
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:48,262
how features are abroad, I am
skilless of: but, by my modesty

628
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:51,144
I would not wish any companion
in the world but you

629
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:57,824
nor can imagination form a shape,
besides yourself, to like of

630
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:01,308
But I prattle something too wildly
and my mother's precepts

631
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:02,698
I therein do forget

632
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:06,907
I am in my condition a prince,
Miranda

633
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:11,661
I do think, a king I would, not so

634
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,787
Hear my soul speak!

635
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:18,859
The very instant that I saw you,
did my heart fly to your service

636
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:22,029
there resides, to make me slave to it

637
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:27,140
and for your sake am I this
patient log-man

638
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:30,665
Do you love me?

639
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:36,981
O heaven, O earth,
bear witness to this sound

640
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:43,622
I beyond all limit of what else i' th' world

641
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:49,581
Do love, prize, honour you

642
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:52,423
I am a fool

643
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:55,830
To weep at what I am glad of

644
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:59,108
Wherefore weep you?

645
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:03,104
At mine unworthiness
which dare not offer

646
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:08,510
what I desire to give and much less
take what I shall die to want

647
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:10,183
But this is trifling

648
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:14,867
and all the more it seeks to hide itself,
the bigger bulk it shows

649
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:20,229
Hence, bashful cunning, and prompt me,
plain and holy innocence!

650
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:26,303
I am your wife, if you will marry me

651
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:28,506
If not, I'll die your maid

652
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:29,870
To be your fellow you may deny me

653
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:31,827
but I'll be your servant whether
you will or no

654
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:36,060
My mistress, dearest
And I thus humble ever

655
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:38,266
My husband, then?

656
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:43,504
Ay, with a heart as willing as
bondage e'er of freedom

657
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:48,099
- Here's my hand
- And mine

658
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:51,819
with my heart in't

659
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:01,109
and now farewell

660
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:04,899
Till half an hour hence

661
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:08,745
A thousand thousand!

662
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:36,268
Had I plantation of this isle,
my lord and were the king on't

663
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:37,509
what would I do?

664
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:40,547
'Scape being drunk for want of wine

665
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:45,301
No occupation: all men idle,
all and women too

666
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:47,461
but innocent and pure: no sovereignty

667
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:49,188
Yet he would be king on't

668
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:52,547
The latter end of his common
wealth forgets the beginning

669
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:53,950
Nature...

670
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:58,586
Nature, without sweat or endeavour
would bring forth, of its own kind

671
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:01,862
all foison, all abundance
to feed my innocent people

672
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:06,706
- No marrying 'mong his subjects?
- None, man, all idle

673
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:08,070
whores and knaves

674
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:12,308
I would with such perfection govern,
sir, t'excel the Golden Age

675
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:15,707
- God save his majesty!
- Long live Gonzalo!

676
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:18,225
And, do you mark me, sir?

677
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:21,587
Prithee, no more
Thou dost talk nothing to me

678
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,069
I do well believe your Majesty

679
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:25,824
and did it to minister occasion
to these gentlemen

680
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:28,902
who are of such sensible
and nimble lungs

681
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:30,469
that they always use
to laugh at nothing

682
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,029
'Twas you we laughed at

683
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:35,944
Who in this kind of merry fooling am
nothing to you so you may continue

684
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:37,310
and laugh at nothing still

685
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:40,348
What a blow was there given!

686
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:42,546
Nay, good my lord, be not angry

687
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:48,610
No, I warrant you: I will not
adventure my discretion so weakly

688
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:56,787
Will you laugh me asleep?

689
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:02,141
I am very heavy

690
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,623
Go sleep, and hear us

691
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:09,226
What, so soon asleep?

692
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:13,906
I wish mine eyes would, with
themselves, shut up my thoughts

693
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:17,779
I find they are inclined to do so

694
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:21,061
Do not omit the heavy offer of it

695
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:25,189
It seldom visits sorrow
when it doth, it is a comforter

696
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,466
We two, my lord, will guard your person

697
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:29,939
while you take your rest
and watch your safety

698
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:34,740
Thank you! Wondrous heavy

699
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:43,023
What a strange drowsiness
possesses them!

700
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:45,579
It is the quality o' th' climate

701
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,786
Why doth it not then our eyelids sink?

702
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:53,902
- I find not myself disposed to sleep
- Nor I my spirits are nimble

703
00:52:54,150 --> 00:53:00,050
They fell together, as by consent
They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke

704
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:06,666
What might, worthy Sebastian
O, what might?

705
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:08,909
No more!

706
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:12,862
And yet methinks I see it in thy
face, what thou shouldst be

707
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:14,784
Th' occasion speaks thee

708
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:19,461
and my strong imagination sees
a crown dropping upon thy head

709
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:21,222
What? Art thou waking?

710
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:23,028
Do you not hear me speak?

711
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:29,090
I do, and surely it is a sleepy language
and thou speak'st out of thy sleep

712
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:33,270
What is it thou didst say?

713
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:39,100
This is a strange repose,
to be asleep with eyes wide open

714
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:42,103
standing, speaking, moving

715
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:43,783
and yet so fast asleep

716
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:49,850
Noble Sebastian, thou let'st
thy fortune sleep, die, rather

717
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:52,584
wink'st whiles thou art waking

718
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:56,220
Thou dost snore distinctly

719
00:53:58,070 --> 00:53:59,423
there's meaning in thy snores

720
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:01,865
I am more serious than my custom

721
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:06,546
You must be so too, if heed me
which to do trebles thee o'er

722
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:10,942
Well, I am standing water

723
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:13,578
I'll teach you how to flow

724
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:17,743
Do so. To ebb hereditary
sloth instructs me

725
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:19,110
Thus, sir

726
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:23,468
Although this lord hath here almost
persuaded the king his son's alive

727
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:27,623
'tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
as he that sleeps here swims

728
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:28,990
I have no hope that he's undrown'd

729
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:31,829
O, out of that no hope what great
hope have you!

730
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:35,467
No hope that way is another way
so high a hope

731
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:40,102
that even ambition cannot pierce a wink
beyond but doubt discovery there

732
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:43,262
Will you grant with me
that Ferdinand is drown'd?

733
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:44,863
- He's gone
- Then, tell me

734
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:47,385
Who's the next heir of Naples?

735
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,946
- Claribel
- She that is Queen of Tunis

736
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:53,749
she that dwells ten leagues
beyond man's life

737
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:57,949
she that from whom we all were
sea-swallow'd though some cast again

738
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:02,547
and, by that destiny, to perform an act
whereof what's past is prologue

739
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:06,100
what to come in yours
and my discharge

740
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:08,022
What stuff is this? How say you?

741
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:12,308
Say, this were death that now
hath seized them

742
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:14,222
why, they were no worse
than now they are

743
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:18,508
There be that can rule Naples as
well as he that sleeps

744
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:21,668
O, that you bore the mind that I do!

745
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:24,981
What a sleep were this for your
advancement! Do you understand me?

746
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:26,149
Methinks I do

747
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:30,541
And how does your content tender
your own good fortune?

748
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:34,704
I remember you did supplant
your sister Prospera

749
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:38,306
True. And look how well my
garments sit upon me

750
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,340
My sister's servants
were then my fellows

751
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:44,068
now they are my men

752
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:49,823
- But, for your conscience
- Ay, sir: where lies that?

753
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:52,584
Twenty consciences, that stand
'twixt me and Milan

754
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:56,026
candied be they and melt,
ere they molest!

755
00:55:56,190 --> 00:56:00,229
Here lies your brother, no better
than the earth he lies upon

756
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,824
If he were that which now
he's like, that's dead

757
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:08,189
Whom I, with this obedient steel three
inches of it can lay to bed forever

758
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:11,820
whiles you, doing thus,
to this ancient morsel

759
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:15,699
this Sir prudence
who should not upbraid our course

760
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:18,100
Thy case, dear friend,
shall be my precedent

761
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:20,864
As thou got'st Milan,
I'll come by Naples

762
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:24,909
Draw thy sword. One stroke shall free
thee from the tribute which thou payest

763
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:29,746
and I the King shall love thee

764
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:38,108
Draw together, and when I rear my
hand, do you the like

765
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:41,467
to fall it on Gonzalo

766
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:55,823
While you here do snoring lie

767
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:58,868
open-eyed conspiracy

768
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:03,178
his time doth take

769
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:07,059
If of life you keep a care

770
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:11,303
shake off slumber and beware

771
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:13,540
Awake! awake!

772
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:17,229
Good angels preserve the King

773
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:18,430
Why?

774
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:21,143
Why are you drawn?

775
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:22,584
Wherefore this ghastly looking?

776
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:23,709
What's the matter?

777
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:26,861
Whiles we stood here securing
your repose even now

778
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:29,942
we heard a hollow burst
of bellowing like bulls

779
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:31,589
or rather lions

780
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:34,469
Did't not wake you?
It struck mine ear most terribly

781
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:37,383
- I heard nothing
- O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear

782
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:38,750
to make an earthquake!

783
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,030
Heard you this, Gonzalo?

784
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:43,546
Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a
humming, which did awake me

785
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,702
As mine eyes open'd,
I saw their weapons drawn

786
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:49,989
'Tis best we stand upon our guard,
or that we quit this place

787
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:51,942
Let's draw our weapons

788
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:54,947
Lead off this ground

789
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:58,261
and let's make further search
for my poor son

790
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:02,664
Lead away

791
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:15,028
Now Prospera shall
know what I have done

792
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:18,341
So, King, go safely on to seek thy son

793
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:25,389
You're blind drunk!

794
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:30,020
Tell not me! When the butt is out, we will
drink water: not a drop before

795
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:34,388
Therefore bear up, and board 'em
Servant-monster, drink to me

796
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:38,221
Servant monster?
The folly of this island!

797
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:41,621
They say there's but five upon
this isle; we are three of them

798
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:44,543
If th' other two be brained like
us, the state totters

799
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:51,065
Mooncalf, speak once in thy life,
if thou beest a good mooncalf

800
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:52,868
How does thy honour?

801
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:57,705
Let me lick thy shoe
I'll not serve him

802
00:58:57,870 --> 00:58:59,070
he's not valiant

803
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:03,382
Thou liest, most ignorant monster

804
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:06,940
Why, thou deboshed fish thou

805
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:12,582
Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but
half a fish and half a monster?

806
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:15,344
Lo, how he mocks me!

807
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,387
Wilt thou let him, my lord?

808
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:21,748
Lord quoth he! That a monster
should be such a natural!

809
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:25,141
Lo, lo, again! bite him
to death, I prithee

810
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:27,585
Trinculo, keep a good
tongue in your head

811
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:31,869
If you prove a mutineer... the next tree!

812
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:36,508
The poor monster's my subject
and he shall not suffer indignity

813
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:39,468
I thank my noble lord

814
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:46,030
Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once
again to the suit I made to thee?

815
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:48,943
Marry, will I. Kneel and repeat it

816
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:53,467
I will stand, and so shall Trinculo

817
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:01,182
As I told thee before

818
01:00:01,350 --> 01:00:06,265
I am subject to a tyrant, a sorceress

819
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:09,979
that by her cunning hath cheated
me of the island

820
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:11,790
Thou liest

821
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:16,669
Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou

822
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:19,063
I do not lie

823
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:22,063
Trinculo, if you trouble him any
more in's tale by this hand

824
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:23,902
I will supplant some of your teeth

825
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:25,549
Why, I said nothing

826
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:28,668
Mum, then, and no more

827
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:30,422
Proceed

828
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:36,384
I say, by sorcery she got this isle

829
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:39,618
from me she got it

830
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:45,024
If thy greatness will revenge it on her

831
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:49,900
thou shalt be lord of it
and I'll serve thee

832
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:53,740
How now shall this be compassed?
Canst thou bring me to the party?

833
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:55,948
Yea, yea, my lord!

834
01:00:56,110 --> 01:01:01,787
I'll yield her thee asleep, where thou
mayst knock a nail into her head

835
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:05,024
Thou liest: thou canst not

836
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:09,223
What a pied ninny's this!
Thou scurvy patch!

837
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:13,019
I do beseech thy greatness, give him
blows and take his bottle from him

838
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:18,344
Why, what did I? I did nothing
I'll go farther off

839
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:20,148
Didst thou not just say he lied?

840
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:21,629
Thou liest

841
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:26,545
Do I so? Take thou that. As you like
this, give me the lie another time

842
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:29,622
Why? I did not give the lie

843
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:32,258
Out o' your wits and bearing too?
A pox o' your bottle!

844
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:33,829
And the devil take your fingers!

845
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:38,870
Now...

846
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:43,104
forward with your tale

847
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:46,342
- Prithee
- Stand farther off

848
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:52,067
Come, proceed

849
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:59,970
Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with
her, I' th'late afternoon to sleep

850
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:03,464
there thou mayst brain her

851
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:08,750
having first seized her books
or with a log batter her skull

852
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:12,664
or paunch her with a stake
or cut her wezand with thy knife

853
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:18,269
But remember first
to possess her books

854
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:21,900
for without them she's but a sot,
as I am

855
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:26,109
nor hath not one spirit to command

856
01:02:26,270 --> 01:02:31,469
they all do hate her as rootedly as I

857
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:35,100
Burn but her books

858
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:40,783
And that most deeply to consider

859
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:44,704
is the beauty of her daughter

860
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:49,466
Of women I've seen but these
and Sycorax my dam

861
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:53,862
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax

862
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:56,066
as great'st does least

863
01:02:57,150 --> 01:03:00,825
Is it so brave a lass?

864
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:05,623
Ay, lord

865
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:09,021
she will become thy bed, I warrant

866
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:13,820
And bring thee forth brave brood

867
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:18,462
Monster, I will kill this witch

868
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:24,381
her daughter and I will be King
and Queen

869
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:28,862
and Trinculo and thyself shall be
viceroys

870
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:31,905
Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo?

871
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:33,583
Excellent

872
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:35,149
Give me thy hand

873
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:41,746
I am sorry I beat thee

874
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:45,102
Within this half hour will she be asleep

875
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:46,749
Wilt thou destroy her then?

876
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:49,378
Ay, on mine honour

877
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:52,549
This will I tell my master

878
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:57,628
Thou makest me merry
I am full of pleasure

879
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:00,109
Come on, Trinculo, let us sing

880
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:02,465
Flout 'em and scout 'em
and scout 'em and flout 'em

881
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:06,225
Thought is free! Grog 'em then flog 'em
and flog 'em and grog 'em

882
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:07,618
Thought is free

883
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:09,746
Nab 'em and stab 'em,
stab 'em and nab 'em

884
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:11,110
Thought is free

885
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:13,101
Bag 'em and hang 'em,
hang 'em and bag 'em

886
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:14,589
Thought is free

887
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:18,823
Play 'em and flay 'em, flay 'em
and play 'em. Thought is free

888
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:24,790
What is this same?

889
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:29,826
If thou beest a man, show thyself

890
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:33,699
O, forgive me my sins!

891
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,070
Mercy upon us!

892
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:38,426
Art thou afeard?

893
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:39,943
No, monster, not I

894
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:45,340
Be not afeard: the isle is full of noises

895
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:50,948
sounds and sweet airs, that give
delight and hurt not

896
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:58,062
Sometimes a thousand twangling
instruments will hum about mine ears

897
01:04:59,790 --> 01:05:04,705
and sometime voices that, if I
then had waked after long sleep

898
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:07,748
will make me sleep again

899
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:13,660
and then, in dreaming,
the clouds methought would open

900
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:18,142
and show riches ready to drop
upon me that, when I waked

901
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:24,548
I cried to dream again

902
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:30,306
This will prove a brave kingdom to me,
where I shall have my music for nothing

903
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:35,346
When Prospera is destroyed

904
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:55,348
By'r Lakin

905
01:05:56,350 --> 01:05:59,467
I can go no further, sir
I needs must rest me

906
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:04,260
Old lord, I cannot blame thee, who
am myself attach'd with weariness

907
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:06,739
Sit down, and rest

908
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:09,788
He is drown'd whom thus
we stray to find

909
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:13,545
and the sea mocks our frustrate
search on land

910
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:17,507
Well, let him go

911
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:19,979
I am right glad
that he's so out of hope

912
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:22,380
The next advantage will we take
thoroughly

913
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:24,063
Let it be tonight

914
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:32,668
What harmony is this?
My good friends, hark!

915
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:37,508
Marvellous sweet music!

916
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:42,580
Give us kind keepers, heavens!

917
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:52,141
A living drollery

918
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:55,222
Now I will believe
that there are unicorns

919
01:06:57,190 --> 01:07:00,785
If in Naples, I should report this
now, would they believe me?

920
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:07,866
We have stomachs

921
01:07:08,870 --> 01:07:11,987
Will't please you taste of what is here?

922
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:16,263
Faith, sir, you need not fear

923
01:07:16,430 --> 01:07:20,503
I will stand to and feed
although my last, no matter

924
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:22,422
since I feel the best is past

925
01:07:41,870 --> 01:07:46,261
You are three men of sin!

926
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:51,181
Whom destiny hath caused
to belch up you

927
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:55,666
and on this island where man doth
not inhabit

928
01:07:56,110 --> 01:08:00,501
you 'mongst men being
most unfit to live

929
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:04,548
I have made you mad

930
01:08:07,470 --> 01:08:12,783
You fools! I and my fellows
are ministers of fate

931
01:08:12,950 --> 01:08:14,508
the elements

932
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:19,222
of whom your swords are temper'd may
as well wound the loud winds

933
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:24,418
as diminish one dowle
that's in my plume

934
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:29,186
But remember

935
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:34,147
for that's my business to you

936
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:38,588
that you three from Milan did
supplant good Prospera

937
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:42,223
her and her innocent child

938
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:46,906
for which foul deed the powers,
delaying, not forgetting

939
01:08:47,070 --> 01:08:51,188
have incensed the seas and shores

940
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:56,504
yea, all the creatures,
against your peace

941
01:08:58,350 --> 01:09:02,309
Thee of thy son, Alonso,
they have bereft

942
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:06,463
and do pronounce
by me lingering perdition

943
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:12,227
shall step by step attend you
and your ways

944
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:24,067
Bravely the figure of this harpy
hast thou perform'd, my Ariel

945
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:27,262
My high charms work

946
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:30,866
and these mine enemies are all
knit up in their distractions

947
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:34,147
they now are in my pow'r

948
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:39,785
I' the name of something holy, sir

949
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:42,988
why stand you in this strange stare?

950
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:46,347
O, it is monstrous, monstrous!

951
01:09:46,510 --> 01:09:49,343
Methought the billows spoke
and told me of it

952
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:51,660
the winds did sing it to me

953
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:53,550
and the thunder

954
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:57,299
that deep and dreadful organ pipe
pronounced the name of Prospera

955
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:59,188
it did bass my trespass

956
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:02,702
Therefore my son i' th' ooze is bedded

957
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:06,341
and I'll seek him deeper than e'er
plummet sounded

958
01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:09,101
and with him there lie mudded

959
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:12,065
But one fiend at a time,
I'll fight their legions o'er

960
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:13,789
I'll be thy second

961
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:16,510
All three of them are desperate

962
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:21,619
their great guilt, like poison
given to work a great time after

963
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:24,539
now 'gins to bite the spirits

964
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:28,385
I shall follow them swiftly
and hinder them

965
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:32,907
from what this ecstasy may
now provoke them to

966
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:51,899
If I have too austerely punish'd you,
your compensation makes amends

967
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:55,540
for I have given you here a third
of mine own life

968
01:10:57,190 --> 01:11:00,421
or that for which I live

969
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:04,826
all thy vexations were but
my trials of thy love

970
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:07,663
and thou hast strangely stood the test

971
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:12,148
O Ferdinand, do not smile at me
that I boast of her

972
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:18,101
for thou shalt find she will outstrip all
praise and make it halt behind her

973
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:20,859
I do believe it against an oracle

974
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:26,627
Then, as my gift and thine own
acquisition worthily purchased

975
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:32,019
take my daughter

976
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:52,147
But If thou dost break her virgin-knot
before all sanctimonious ceremonies

977
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:56,701
no sweet aspersion shall the heavens
let fall to make this contract grow

978
01:11:56,910 --> 01:12:00,459
As I hope for quiet days,
fair issue and long life

979
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:04,545
the strongest temptation shall
never melt mine honour into lust

980
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:08,583
Fairly spoke

981
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:12,388
Sit then and talk with her

982
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:14,946
she is thine own

983
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:28,179
Monster, your fairy
which you say is a harmless fairy

984
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:30,261
has done little better than played
the Jack with us

985
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:35,709
Monster, I do smell all horse-piss, at
which my nose is in great indignation

986
01:12:35,870 --> 01:12:37,383
So is mine. Do you hear, monster?

987
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:41,103
Good my lord, give me thy favour still

988
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:43,989
Ay, but to lose our bottles
in the pool

989
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:46,266
There is not only disgrace
and dishonour in that, monster

990
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:48,307
but an infinite loss

991
01:12:48,590 --> 01:12:54,187
That's more to me than my wetting. Yet
all this is your harmless fairy, monster

992
01:13:01,150 --> 01:13:02,981
What, Ariel!

993
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:06,388
My industrious servant

994
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:10,228
- Ariel!
-What would my potent master?

995
01:13:10,990 --> 01:13:12,109
Here I am

996
01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:16,069
Go bring the rabble, o'er whom I give
thee pow'r, here to this place

997
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:17,458
Incite them to quick motion

998
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:22,142
for I must bestow upon the eyes
of this young couple

999
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:27,144
some vanity of mine art; it is my promise
and they expect it from me

1000
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:29,301
- Presently?
- Ay, with a twink

1001
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:31,745
Before you can say "Come' and Go"!

1002
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:33,389
Do you love me, master?

1003
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:35,864
No?

1004
01:13:36,030 --> 01:13:39,466
Dearly my delicate Ariel

1005
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:50,650
O mistress mine, where are you
roaming?

1006
01:13:54,790 --> 01:14:00,690
Oh stay and hear!
Your true love's coming

1007
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:09,530
that can sing both high and low

1008
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:16,530
trip no further, pretty sweeting,
journey's end in lover's meeting

1009
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:25,050
every wise man's son doth know

1010
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:30,109
What is love? Tis not hereafter

1011
01:14:30,270 --> 01:14:34,707
present mirth hath present laughter

1012
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:40,770
what's to come is still unsure

1013
01:14:41,550 --> 01:14:45,543
in delay there lies no plenty

1014
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:49,783
then come kiss me,
sweet-and-twenty

1015
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:53,226
youth's a stuff...

1016
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:59,290
...will not endure, will not endure

1017
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:09,906
Look thou be true

1018
01:15:10,190 --> 01:15:11,828
Do not give dalliance too much the rein

1019
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:15,187
the strongest oaths are straw
to the fire i' th' blood

1020
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:16,469
I warrant you madam

1021
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:20,941
The white cold virgin snow upon my
heart abates the ardour of my liver

1022
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:22,949
Well...

1023
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:32,509
No tongue! All eyes! Be silent

1024
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:35,828
I had forgot that foul conspiracy
of the beast Caliban

1025
01:16:36,030 --> 01:16:38,783
and his confederates
against my life

1026
01:16:39,150 --> 01:16:43,905
Avoid! No more! No more!

1027
01:16:49,790 --> 01:16:53,260
This is strange. Your mother's in some
passion that works her strongly

1028
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:58,026
Never till this day saw I her
touch'd with anger so distemper'd

1029
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:03,348
You do look, my son, in a moved sort,
as if you were dismay'd be cheerful, sir

1030
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:06,865
Our revels now are ended

1031
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:12,345
These our actors, as I foretold you,
were all spirits

1032
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:17,504
and are melted into air
into thin air

1033
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:23,345
and, like the baseless fabric
of this vision

1034
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:29,267
the cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous
palaces, the solemn temples

1035
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:36,090
the great globe itself, yea, all which
it inherit shall dissolve

1036
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:41,981
and, like this insubstantial
pageant faded

1037
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:46,024
leave not a rack behind

1038
01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:51,421
We are such stuff
as dreams are made on

1039
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:55,742
and our little life is rounded with a sleep

1040
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:03,782
Sir, I am vex'd

1041
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:07,581
If you be pleased, retire into my cell
and there repose

1042
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:11,220
a turn or two I'll walk, to still
my beating mind

1043
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:13,984
We wish your peace

1044
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:21,188
Come with a thought!

1045
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:24,349
I thank thee, Ariel. Come

1046
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:26,864
What's thy pleasure?

1047
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:30,705
Spirit. We must prepare
to meet with Caliban

1048
01:18:30,870 --> 01:18:32,035
Ay, my commander

1049
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:34,743
Say again, where didst thou leave
these varlets?

1050
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:38,266
I told you, ma'am, they were
red-hot with drinking

1051
01:18:38,430 --> 01:18:40,898
I left them I' the filthy-mantled
pool beyond your cell

1052
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:45,860
There dancing up to the chins,
that the foul lake outstunk their feet

1053
01:18:46,910 --> 01:18:48,548
This was well done, my bird

1054
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:56,061
The trumpery in my house, go put it
out, for stale to catch these thieves

1055
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:58,664
I go, I go

1056
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:05,221
A devil, a born devil

1057
01:19:05,390 --> 01:19:08,109
on whose nature nurture
can never stick

1058
01:19:08,270 --> 01:19:14,170
on whom my pains, humanely taken
all, all lost, quite lost!

1059
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:20,786
I will plague them all, even to roaring

1060
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:29,822
Pray you, tread softly
We now are near her cell

1061
01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:40,030
O no

1062
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:44,945
Prithee, be quiet. Seest thou here?
This is the mouth o' the cell

1063
01:19:47,790 --> 01:19:51,226
Give me thy hand. I do begin to
have bloody thoughts

1064
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:09,019
O King Stephano! O worthy Stephano!

1065
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:11,624
Look what a wardrobe here is for thee!

1066
01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:14,623
Let it alone, thou fool!
It is but trash

1067
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:18,624
O, ho, monster! We know what
belongs to a frippery

1068
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:21,583
O king Stephano!

1069
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:24,139
Put off that gown, Trinculo!
By this hand, I'll have that gown

1070
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:26,949
Thy Grace shall have it

1071
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:37,947
I look a dream, don't I

1072
01:20:38,110 --> 01:20:40,066
How can it be real

1073
01:20:42,790 --> 01:20:44,860
Look at the business, Gov'ner

1074
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:52,664
What do you mean to dote
thus on such luggage?

1075
01:20:52,830 --> 01:20:54,661
Let's alone and do the murder first

1076
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:57,185
Be you quiet, monster

1077
01:20:57,350 --> 01:21:01,263
Mistress line, is not this my jerkin?

1078
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:06,549
Do, do! We steal by line and level

1079
01:21:06,710 --> 01:21:08,666
and't like your Grace

1080
01:21:09,710 --> 01:21:12,747
I thank thee for that jest
Here's a garment for't

1081
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:17,188
Wit shall not go unrewarded
while I am king of this country

1082
01:21:17,470 --> 01:21:20,940
Monster, come, put some lime upon
your fingers, and away with the rest

1083
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:25,183
I will have none on't. We shall lose our
time, and all be turned to barnacles

1084
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:31,250
Monster, lay-on your fingers,
or I'll turn thee from my kingdom

1085
01:21:32,710 --> 01:21:34,860
- Go to, carry this
- And this

1086
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:36,941
Ay, and this

1087
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:42,187
Hey, Mountain, hey!

1088
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:44,270
Silver!

1089
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:54,827
Fury, Fury!
There, tyrant, there!

1090
01:22:01,230 --> 01:22:02,743
Hark!

1091
01:22:02,910 --> 01:22:04,110
They roar!

1092
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:20,107
Let them be hunted soundly

1093
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:28,210
At this hour lie at my mercy
all mine enemies

1094
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:33,538
Now does my project gather to a head

1095
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:38,026
Shortly shall all my labours end

1096
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:42,547
and thou shalt have the air at freedom

1097
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:56,145
Say, my spirit, how fares the King
and's followers?

1098
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:58,062
Just as you left them

1099
01:22:58,230 --> 01:23:00,380
All prisoners, ma'am

1100
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:05,419
The King, his brother and yours,
abide all three distracted

1101
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:12,130
but chiefly him that you term'd, ma'am
'The good old lord Gonzalo'...

1102
01:23:13,630 --> 01:23:19,307
His tears run down his beard, like
winter's drops from eaves of reeds

1103
01:23:20,150 --> 01:23:23,938
Your charm so strongly works 'em

1104
01:23:24,590 --> 01:23:28,060
that if you now beheld them

1105
01:23:28,430 --> 01:23:32,264
your affections would become tender

1106
01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:37,059
Dost thou think so, spirit?

1107
01:23:37,790 --> 01:23:40,020
Mine would, master

1108
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:43,225
were I human

1109
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:49,739
And mine shall

1110
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:53,339
Hast thou, which art but air

1111
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:57,981
a touch, a feeling of their afflictions
and shall not myself

1112
01:23:58,150 --> 01:24:03,144
one of their kind be kindlier
moved than thou art?

1113
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:09,864
Though with their high wrongs
I am struck to th' quick

1114
01:24:12,190 --> 01:24:17,822
yet with my nobler reason
'gainst my fury do I take part

1115
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:21,222
The rarer action is in virtue
than in vengeance

1116
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:24,382
They being penitent

1117
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:29,624
the sole drift of my purpose doth
extend not a frown further

1118
01:24:31,030 --> 01:24:33,021
Go, release them, Ariel

1119
01:24:34,990 --> 01:24:37,902
My charms I'll break

1120
01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:42,628
their senses I'll restore, and
they shall be themselves

1121
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:45,747
I'll fetch them, ma'am

1122
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:59,501
Ye elves of hills, brooks,
standing lakes and groves

1123
01:25:00,190 --> 01:25:03,660
and ye that on the sands
with printless foot

1124
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:08,221
do chase the ebbing Neptune and do
fly him when he comes back

1125
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:14,309
you demi-puppets that by moonshine
do the green sour ringlets make

1126
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:17,428
whereof the ewe not bites

1127
01:25:17,990 --> 01:25:21,903
and you whose pastime is to make
midnight mushrooms

1128
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:25,699
that rejoice to hear the solemn curfew

1129
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:30,462
by whose aid
weak masters though ye be

1130
01:25:47,550 --> 01:25:49,939
I have bedimm'd the noontide sun

1131
01:25:50,350 --> 01:25:53,899
call'd forth the mutinous winds

1132
01:25:54,110 --> 01:25:58,661
and 'twixt the green sea
and the azured vault, set roaring war

1133
01:25:58,830 --> 01:26:01,822
to the dread rattling thunder
have I given fire

1134
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:05,585
and rifted Jove's stout oak
with his own bolt

1135
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:09,220
the strong-based promontory
have I made shake

1136
01:26:09,390 --> 01:26:13,269
and by the spurs pluck'd up
the pine and cedar

1137
01:26:13,430 --> 01:26:17,264
graves at my command have
waked their sleepers oped

1138
01:26:17,430 --> 01:26:19,739
and let 'em forth

1139
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:23,744
by my so potent art

1140
01:26:32,190 --> 01:26:36,069
But this rough magic I here abjure

1141
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:42,585
and, when I have required some
heavenly music which even now I do

1142
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:47,460
to work mine end upon their senses
that this airy charm is for

1143
01:26:50,590 --> 01:26:52,785
I'll break my staff

1144
01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:57,506
bury it certain fathoms in the earth

1145
01:26:59,110 --> 01:27:03,069
and deeper than did
ever plummet sound

1146
01:27:05,630 --> 01:27:08,269
I'll drown my book

1147
01:27:53,950 --> 01:27:57,943
There stand, for you are spell-stopp'd

1148
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:04,581
O good Gonzalo, my true preserver

1149
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:07,469
and a loyal sir to him you follow'st

1150
01:28:07,630 --> 01:28:11,703
I will pay thy graces home
both in word and deed

1151
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:17,186
Most cruelly didst thou, Alonso,
use me and my daughter

1152
01:28:17,630 --> 01:28:21,305
Thy brother was a furtherer in the act

1153
01:28:21,470 --> 01:28:24,826
Thou art pinched for't now, Sebastian

1154
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:32,370
Flesh and blood, you, brother mine

1155
01:28:32,830 --> 01:28:37,062
that entertain'd ambition, expell'd
remorse and nature

1156
01:28:37,310 --> 01:28:40,382
who, with Sebastian, would
here have killed your king

1157
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:46,108
I do forgive thee, unnatural
though thou art

1158
01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:51,182
Their understanding begins to swell

1159
01:28:57,710 --> 01:28:58,910
Ariel

1160
01:28:59,150 --> 01:29:03,621
fetch me the skirt and bodice from my
cell I will discase me, and myself present

1161
01:29:03,790 --> 01:29:07,100
as I was sometime Milan

1162
01:29:08,590 --> 01:29:11,184
Quickly, spirit! Thou shalt ere
long be free

1163
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:29,062
O I shall miss thee Ariel

1164
01:29:30,670 --> 01:29:33,468
but yet thou shalt have freedom

1165
01:29:36,350 --> 01:29:37,749
so...

1166
01:29:38,590 --> 01:29:40,103
so...

1167
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:42,903
so...

1168
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:47,943
Behold the wronged Duchess
of Milan, Prospera

1169
01:29:49,270 --> 01:29:51,147
I bid a hearty welcome

1170
01:29:54,990 --> 01:30:00,890
Whe'r thou be'st she or no, or some
enchanted trifle to abuse me I not know

1171
01:30:04,550 --> 01:30:06,825
thy pulse beats as of flesh and blood

1172
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:11,901
and, since I saw thee,
th' affliction of my mind amends

1173
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:14,709
with which, I fear, a madness held me

1174
01:30:15,270 --> 01:30:19,946
This must crave and if this be at all
a most strange story

1175
01:30:20,870 --> 01:30:25,739
Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat
thou pardon me my wrongs

1176
01:30:27,070 --> 01:30:30,142
But how should Prospera
be living and be here?

1177
01:30:35,350 --> 01:30:37,818
First, noble friend

1178
01:30:37,990 --> 01:30:39,548
let me embrace thine age

1179
01:30:41,430 --> 01:30:43,819
whose honour cannot
be measured or confined

1180
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:48,984
Whether this be or be not, I'll not swear

1181
01:30:49,430 --> 01:30:51,421
Welcome, my friends all

1182
01:30:52,590 --> 01:30:54,421
But you, my brace of lords

1183
01:30:55,990 --> 01:31:01,269
were I so minded I could here
pluck his Highness' frown upon you

1184
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:03,944
and justify you traitors

1185
01:31:05,910 --> 01:31:08,299
at this time I will tell no tales

1186
01:31:09,470 --> 01:31:11,938
- The devil speaks in her
- No

1187
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:19,709
For you, most wicked sir

1188
01:31:20,590 --> 01:31:24,549
whom to call brother would even
infect my mouth

1189
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:31,467
I do forgive thy rankest fault, all of them

1190
01:31:33,870 --> 01:31:37,783
and require my dukedom of thee, which
perforce, I know thou must restore

1191
01:31:38,270 --> 01:31:42,149
If thou beest Prospera, give us
particulars of thy preservation

1192
01:31:42,550 --> 01:31:43,824
How thou hast met us here

1193
01:31:43,990 --> 01:31:47,505
who three hours since were
wracked upon this shore

1194
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:51,345
where I have lost my dear son
Ferdinand

1195
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:53,548
I am woe for't, sir

1196
01:31:53,990 --> 01:31:55,662
for I have lost my daughter

1197
01:31:56,710 --> 01:31:58,268
A daughter?

1198
01:31:58,910 --> 01:32:00,502
When did you lose your daughter?

1199
01:32:00,670 --> 01:32:02,467
In this last tempest

1200
01:32:03,710 --> 01:32:06,099
But, howsoe'er you have been
justled from your senses

1201
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:09,580
know for certain that I am Prospera

1202
01:32:16,670 --> 01:32:18,342
Welcome, sir

1203
01:32:19,230 --> 01:32:21,903
This cell's my court

1204
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:25,309
I pray you, look in

1205
01:32:27,990 --> 01:32:29,469
Sweet lord, you play me false

1206
01:32:29,630 --> 01:32:31,666
No, my dear'st love,
I would not for the world

1207
01:32:31,830 --> 01:32:34,628
Yes, for a score of kingdoms
you should wrangle

1208
01:32:34,790 --> 01:32:37,020
and I would call it, fair play

1209
01:32:37,190 --> 01:32:40,899
If this prove a vision of the island,
one dear son shall I twice lose

1210
01:32:41,070 --> 01:32:43,789
Though the seas threaten,
they are merciful

1211
01:32:44,270 --> 01:32:46,067
I have cursed them without cause

1212
01:32:46,230 --> 01:32:49,461
Now all the blessings of a glad
father compass thee about!

1213
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:52,781
Arise, and say how thou camest here

1214
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:57,229
O, wonder!

1215
01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:03,269
How many goodly creatures are there
here! How beauteous mankind is!

1216
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:07,423
O brave new world, that has
such people in't!

1217
01:33:07,990 --> 01:33:09,423
'Tis new to thee

1218
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:12,062
What is this maid with whom
thou wast at play?

1219
01:33:12,230 --> 01:33:15,586
Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us
and brought us thus together?

1220
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:20,107
Sir, she is mortal: but by
immortal providence she's mine

1221
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:22,779
I chose her when I could not ask
my father for his advice

1222
01:33:23,350 --> 01:33:25,306
nor thought I had one

1223
01:33:26,030 --> 01:33:27,907
Give me your hands

1224
01:33:29,230 --> 01:33:31,949
Be it so! Amen!

1225
01:33:33,950 --> 01:33:35,150
Was't well done?

1226
01:33:37,190 --> 01:33:39,863
Bravely, my diligence

1227
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:44,819
Set Caliban and his confederates free

1228
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:46,309
Untie the spell

1229
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:01,506
Every man shift for all the rest

1230
01:34:04,150 --> 01:34:07,506
Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!

1231
01:34:19,270 --> 01:34:24,708
If these be true spies which I wear
in my head, then here's a goodly sight

1232
01:34:24,870 --> 01:34:28,465
O Setebos, these be brave
spirits indeed!

1233
01:34:28,910 --> 01:34:31,344
How fine my master is!

1234
01:34:31,910 --> 01:34:33,821
I am afraid she will chastise me

1235
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:39,261
What things are these, my lord
Antonio? Will money buy 'em?

1236
01:34:39,430 --> 01:34:43,628
Very like. One of them is a plain
fish, and no doubt marketable

1237
01:34:43,790 --> 01:34:48,739
These three have robb'd me, and
had plotted together to take my life

1238
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:52,862
Two of these fellows
you must know and own

1239
01:34:54,630 --> 01:34:59,181
This thing of darkness
I acknowledge mine

1240
01:35:00,350 --> 01:35:02,818
I shall be pinched to death

1241
01:35:03,150 --> 01:35:05,903
Is not this Stephano,
my drunken butler?

1242
01:35:06,070 --> 01:35:09,619
And Trinculo is reeling ripe.
How camest thou in this pickle?

1243
01:35:09,950 --> 01:35:13,181
I have been in such a pickle
since I saw you last

1244
01:35:13,350 --> 01:35:16,820
that I fear me, it will never
out my bones

1245
01:35:16,990 --> 01:35:18,218
Why, how now, Stephano!

1246
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:22,184
Touch me not! I am not Stephano,
but a cramp

1247
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:24,468
You'd be king o' the isle, sirrah?

1248
01:35:24,630 --> 01:35:26,029
I should have been a sore one then

1249
01:35:26,190 --> 01:35:28,260
This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on

1250
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:32,420
What a thrice-double ass was I

1251
01:35:32,590 --> 01:35:36,868
to take this drunkard for a god
and worship this dull fool!

1252
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:38,942
Go to! Away!

1253
01:35:40,390 --> 01:35:42,824
Hence, and bestow your luggage
where you found it

1254
01:35:42,990 --> 01:35:45,140
Or stole it, rather

1255
01:35:45,670 --> 01:35:49,379
Sir, I invite your Highness and
your train to my poor cell

1256
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:52,303
where you shall take your rest
for this one night, and in the morn

1257
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:54,859
I'll bring you to your ship
and so to Naples

1258
01:35:55,030 --> 01:36:00,024
where I have hope to see the nuptial
of these our dear-beloved solemnized

1259
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:06,662
and thence retire me to my Milan

1260
01:36:07,510 --> 01:36:13,221
where every third thought
shall be my grave

1261
01:37:18,230 --> 01:37:19,788
My Ariel

1262
01:37:20,310 --> 01:37:22,141
Chick

1263
01:37:22,910 --> 01:37:28,223
That is thy charge
Then to the elements be free

1264
01:37:33,550 --> 01:37:36,144
Where the bee sucks there suck I

1265
01:37:36,310 --> 01:37:38,744
in a cowslip's bell I lie

1266
01:37:38,910 --> 01:37:42,698
there I couch when owl's do cry

1267
01:37:42,870 --> 01:37:44,781
on a bat's back I do fly

1268
01:37:44,950 --> 01:37:50,850
after summer, after summer merrily,
merrily, merrily... shall I live now

1269
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:58,850
under the blossom that hangs
on the bough

1270
01:39:03,190 --> 01:39:09,090
Now my charms are all o'erthrown

1271
01:39:15,470 --> 01:39:21,370
And what strength I have's mine own

1272
01:39:26,030 --> 01:39:31,930
Which is most faint

1273
01:39:42,070 --> 01:39:47,970
O, release me from by bands

1274
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:55,050
With the help of your good hands

1275
01:39:56,470 --> 01:40:00,258
Gentle breath

1276
01:40:01,390 --> 01:40:07,290
gentle breath of yours my sails must fill

1277
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:16,582
Or else my project fails

1278
01:40:16,990 --> 01:40:22,826
Which was to please

1279
01:40:39,590 --> 01:40:42,787
Now, I want...

1280
01:40:42,950 --> 01:40:47,819
Spirits to enforce

1281
01:40:48,430 --> 01:40:54,330
Art to enchant

1282
01:40:54,950 --> 01:40:59,182
And my ending is despair

1283
01:40:59,350 --> 01:41:05,250
unless Ibe relieved by prayer

1284
01:41:09,550 --> 01:41:15,450
Which pierces so that it assaults

1285
01:41:15,630 --> 01:41:21,182
pierces so that it assaults

1286
01:41:21,630 --> 01:41:27,530
Mercy itself and frees all faults

1287
01:41:34,110 --> 01:41:40,010
As you from crimes would pardonned be

1288
01:41:45,310 --> 01:41:51,210
Let your indulgence...

1289
01:41:54,470 --> 01:42:00,370
Let your indulgence...

1290
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:08,850
...set me free

1291
01:42:12,670 --> 01:42:16,902
Now I want

1292
01:42:17,270 --> 01:42:22,583
Spirits to enforce

1293
01:42:22,910 --> 01:42:28,810
art to enchant

1294
01:42:29,230 --> 01:42:33,382
And my ending is despair

1295
01:42:33,790 --> 01:42:39,690
Unless I be relieved by prayer

1296
01:43:15,390 --> 01:43:19,781
Now I want

1297
01:43:19,950 --> 01:43:24,580
Spirits to enforce

1298
01:43:25,390 --> 01:43:31,022
art to enchant

1299
01:43:31,950 --> 01:43:35,989
and my ending is despair

1300
01:43:36,350 --> 01:43:42,250
Unless I be relieved by prayer

1301
01:43:46,550 --> 01:43:52,341
Which pierces so that it assaults

1302
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:58,068
pierces so that it assaults

1303
01:43:58,630 --> 01:44:04,530
Mercy itself and frees all faults

1304
01:44:11,030 --> 01:44:16,423
As you from crimes

1305
01:44:16,590 --> 01:44:20,822
would pardon'd be

1306
01:44:22,350 --> 01:44:28,250
Let your indulgence

1307
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:37,290
Let your indulgence

1308
01:44:40,310 --> 01:44:46,210
...set me free
