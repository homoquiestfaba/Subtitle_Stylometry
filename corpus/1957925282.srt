00:00:02,303 --> 00:00:05,932
[Gina] All the suicide and
death, it was just a gimmick.

2
00:00:06,265 --> 00:00:07,517
Something to get attention.

3
00:00:08,518 --> 00:00:10,895
No one was supposed to take it seriously.

(rock music playing in the background)

24
00:01:49,702 --> 00:01:51,746
[Brooke] You heard what they said to us.

25
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:55,541
Are we all fully committed to this?

26
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:57,835
We oughta be committed.

27
00:01:59,086 --> 00:01:59,846
They've got it.

28
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:01,213
They're killer.

29
00:02:04,216 --> 00:02:06,928
Now, open your envelopes.

30
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:11,515
Let's all think about
what we're going to do.

31
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:14,644
Your sister, she must turn
you on to all kinda shit.

32
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:18,439
I haven't seen her in
person for two years.

33
00:02:18,773 --> 00:02:21,692
But you know, it's like she's
talking to me inside my head.

34
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,696
She says it all in here.

35
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:28,282
She says it outright.

36
00:02:29,325 --> 00:02:34,163
"Life is a dog, a total bummer."

37
00:02:34,497 --> 00:02:36,374
(cassette clanks)

38
00:02:36,707 --> 00:02:40,419
We have no choice in
life except to get out.

39
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:44,173
(eerie music)

40
00:02:44,507 --> 00:02:45,800
Death ends it all.

41
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:48,719
Peace forever.

42
00:02:50,096 --> 00:02:52,598
A nice, warm place to be.

43
00:02:52,932 --> 00:02:54,684
(eerie music)

44
00:02:55,017 --> 00:02:56,017
Are we ready?

45
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:01,482
Then let's do it, just like they told us.

46
00:03:05,027 --> 00:03:08,948
(suspenseful music)

47
00:03:12,368 --> 00:03:15,037
(woman screaming)

48
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:18,416

(camera snaps)

52
00:04:05,046 --> 00:04:07,173
Okay, that'll do you.

53
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:12,636
Oh, look, sleeping beauty has awaken.

54
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,680
Okay, now, this is Susie Stryker.

55
00:04:15,014 --> 00:04:16,223
She's Cynthia Slain.

56
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,317
Ask her questions. She
used to be a magician,

57
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,839
anything you want, you just ask.

58
00:04:20,102 --> 00:04:21,102
You just ask.

59
00:04:21,353 --> 00:04:23,689
Uh, you do magic tricks?

60
00:04:24,023 --> 00:04:26,442
Not tricks, the real thing.

61
00:04:26,776 --> 00:04:28,027
See?

62
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,573
Of course, what I do on
stage is a bit more intense.

63
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:34,283
She dies every night.

64
00:04:34,617 --> 00:04:36,017
And her mentor, the Great Prestoni,

65
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,495
taught her how to do that.

66
00:04:37,828 --> 00:04:38,546
(camera snaps)

67
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:41,373
You know, well, she
eviscerates herself on stage.

68
00:04:42,374 --> 00:04:44,168
Umm, this.

69
00:04:44,502 --> 00:04:45,502
Oh, yeah.

70
00:04:45,628 --> 00:04:47,708
Okay, Susie, Mark, Amy,
let's go in the other room.

71
00:04:47,963 --> 00:04:49,507
Quick, let's go. We're wasting time.

72
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:53,260
Hey, this is supposed to be a rehearsal,

73
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,554
not a photo session.

74
00:04:55,888 --> 00:04:57,473
Where's the reporter from?

75
00:04:57,807 --> 00:04:59,350
Yugoslavia.

76
00:04:59,683 --> 00:05:01,310
Artie says it's important.

77
00:05:01,644 --> 00:05:03,562
Artie wants us to tour there.

78
00:05:03,896 --> 00:05:04,980
She looks like an idiot.

79
00:05:06,065 --> 00:05:07,733
Honey, what's the matter?

80
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:09,067
That dream again?

81
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,656
Brooksie... in trouble, killing herself.

82
00:05:14,698 --> 00:05:15,783
This is the third time.

83
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:18,452
And this is Randy Rot, our drummer.

84
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:19,787
He trained at Juilliard.

85
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:21,121
Nice looking kid, huh?

86
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:22,605
Photographs great from either side.

87
00:05:22,915 --> 00:05:24,125
I'll let you in on a secret.

88
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,618
Now, we're a big family here,

89
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:28,078
but in Randy's case, that
means something extra special

90
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,410
because he's really Mark Grant,

91
00:05:29,505 --> 00:05:32,007
and he is the brother of our
lead singer, Lucy Lethal.

92
00:05:33,008 --> 00:05:35,594
Okay, now you ask him
questions, I'll shut up here.

93
00:05:35,928 --> 00:05:38,305
Uh, excuse me... my English.

94
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,017
Did he say you were lover or a brother?

95
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:44,145
Uh, yeah, babe.

96
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:46,730
She was listening to our music...

97
00:05:47,064 --> 00:05:49,650
and she killed herself
and her friends, too.

98
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:52,278
That dream again?

99
00:05:52,611 --> 00:05:54,530
Don't you ever get tired of it?

100
00:05:54,864 --> 00:05:57,825

should use it, you know.

What do you think?

108
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,804
I think it's time for you to go away.

109
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:20,306
Now!

110
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,640
You're probably right.

111
00:06:21,974 --> 00:06:24,185
We've already done a
suicide album, anyway.

112
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:30,107
[Reporter] Those weapons you
wear look so real, miss...?

113
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:31,117
(Nancy stammers)

114
00:06:31,317 --> 00:06:33,277
Nancy. Nancy Napalm.

115
00:06:33,611 --> 00:06:36,322
And my past realities no longer matter.

116
00:06:36,655 --> 00:06:37,740
The weapons are real.

117
00:06:38,073 --> 00:06:38,791
Real?

118
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:40,135
Would you know how to use them?

119
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,785
Aren't you afraid of them?

120
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:43,204
Afraid?

121
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:47,208
Listen, people frighten
me and these kill them.

122
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,085
So they make me feel good.

123
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:52,087
I know how to use over 200 different

124
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:55,424
military-issued anti-personnel devices.

125
00:06:55,758 --> 00:06:58,302
Do all our songs have to be so down?

126
00:06:58,636 --> 00:06:59,916
Can't we do something different?

127
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:02,598
Come on, honey, songs about
death, dying, and suicide,

128
00:07:02,932 --> 00:07:03,932
that's what we're about.

129
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:05,517
That's what we sell. (scoffs)

130
00:07:05,851 --> 00:07:08,604
We're the Dead Girls, not The Shirelles.

131
00:07:10,064 --> 00:07:11,899
Hey, that's an idea.

132
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:15,986
Our next album could be, "The
Dead Girls Sing Mantovani."

133
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
Ignore her.

134
00:07:18,489 --> 00:07:19,823
Look, honey, I know you're upset,

135
00:07:20,157 --> 00:07:22,034
but don't go off the deep end.

136
00:07:22,368 --> 00:07:25,663
Look at me, I'm made up
like a five-day-old stiff.

137
00:07:25,996 --> 00:07:27,539
You go on stage looking like you do

138
00:07:27,873 --> 00:07:29,541
and call yourself Bertha Beirut,

139
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,515
strangle yourself with the American flag.

140
00:07:31,627 --> 00:07:32,771
I mean, we're not gonna break out

141
00:07:32,795 --> 00:07:34,338
in a chorus of "Stand by Your Man."

142
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:35,306
(door knocks)

143
00:07:35,506 --> 00:07:36,715
Dana, sweetie, come on down.

144
00:07:37,049 --> 00:07:38,717
Let's make nice for these Yugo fans.

145
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:39,727
Come on, come on.

146
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:40,561
Time's a-wasting.

147
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:41,395
Tempus fugit.

148
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:42,595
Hurry, hurry.

149
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:44,974
Yes, daddy.

150
00:07:45,307 --> 00:07:48,519
(rock music playing faintly in background)

151
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:54,233
- Hey.
- Looking for a Gina Verelli.

152
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:56,286
I was told I might be
able to find her here.

153
00:07:56,318 --> 00:07:56,952
Bertha.

154
00:07:57,152 --> 00:07:59,280
No, Gina Verelli.

155
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:00,372
Do you know her?

156
00:08:00,572 --> 00:08:01,207
I know, Bertha.

157
00:08:01,407 --> 00:08:02,407
I know all of them.

158
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,459
All of them?

159
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:04,251
Who are they?

160
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:05,451
They're the Dead Girls.

161
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:07,454
Oh. Well, I'm sorry to hear that,

162
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,415
but I think this Gina Verelli is alive.

163
00:08:09,748 --> 00:08:10,748
Of course she's alive.

164
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,459
She is one of the Dead Girls.

165
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,461
Oh, one of the dead girls you know?

166
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:16,046
Yeah, I know them all.

167
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,380
Well, except for Cynthia.

168
00:08:17,548 --> 00:08:18,182
I don't her so good.

169
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:19,016
Cynthia?

170
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:19,850
Slain.

171
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,050
Along with the others?

172
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:23,053
Yeah, they're all inside together.

173
00:08:23,387 --> 00:08:24,188
They're in there?

174
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:25,588
Those dead girls are in there?

175
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:27,049
Does anybody know about this?

176
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:28,642
Only me and I'm not talking.

177
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:31,061
The others can find out if they can.

178
00:08:31,395 --> 00:08:32,675
Is Gina Verelli in there, too?

179
00:08:32,938 --> 00:08:34,148
Yeah, I told you.

180
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:35,899
Did she kill them?

181
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:37,443
Oh, wait a minute.

182
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:38,536
Wait a minute.

183
00:08:38,736 --> 00:08:39,736
Stay here.

184
00:08:43,365 --> 00:08:45,784
(Karen sighs)

185
00:08:47,369 --> 00:08:49,079
Pay attention. (clears throat)

186
00:08:49,413 --> 00:08:50,413
Dead Girls.

187
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:52,082
The group.

188
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,050
(Karen scoffs)

189
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,169
This is Nancy Napalm.

190
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,880
She wears this, like,
really intense army jacket.

191
00:08:58,213 --> 00:09:00,924
This is Lucy lethal, she is so cool.

192
00:09:01,258 --> 00:09:03,844
And the one you want here,
that is Bertha Beirut.

193
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,096
- The Arab?
- Right.

194
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,265
And she's gonna look like that inside?

195
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:09,767
Yeah, they have outfits on.

196
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,300
They're doing this really
intense photo session tonight.

197
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,897
(camera snaps)

198
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:18,984
Can I help you?

199
00:09:19,318 --> 00:09:22,154
Uh, I have a special
delivery for a Gina Verelli.

200
00:09:22,488 --> 00:09:23,488
Identification.

201
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:25,449
Jeff, he's okay.

202
00:09:25,783 --> 00:09:27,076
I'll vouch for him.

203
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:29,870
If Royal Highness says you're cool,

204
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:31,705
you must be an iceberg.

205
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:32,756
Royal Highness?

206
00:09:32,956 --> 00:09:34,792
Yeah, queen of the groupies.

207
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,419
She's good, she always
knows where we're at.

208
00:09:37,753 --> 00:09:38,429
Come on.

209
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:39,669
How do your parents feel

210
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,715
about your stage act, Bertha Beirut?

211
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:43,967
My parents died when
I was eight years old

212
00:09:44,301 --> 00:09:45,301
in a car accident.

213
00:09:45,469 --> 00:09:47,763
My sister and I were raised
by our aunt and uncle.

214
00:09:48,097 --> 00:09:49,598
(camera snaps)

215
00:09:49,932 --> 00:09:52,226
Hold on, she's in the
middle of an interview.

216
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,371
[Reporter] You write the
songs for the group, correct?

217
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:55,479
Sometimes.

218
00:09:55,813 --> 00:09:56,813
Usually.

219
00:09:57,356 --> 00:09:59,108
Look, you handle the road schedules,

220
00:09:59,441 --> 00:10:00,734
the publicity, the studio time.

221
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,529
We'll make the creative
decisions, okay, sweetie?

222
00:10:03,862 --> 00:10:06,865
Look, doll, whatever you
say is numero uno in my book,

223
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:08,659
but maybe this babushka is right.

224
00:10:08,992 --> 00:10:10,119
Maybe she's cracking up.

225
00:10:10,452 --> 00:10:12,287
It's this death-and-destruction gimmick.

226
00:10:12,621 --> 00:10:14,581
Now, you can ride it for
as far as it'll take you.

227
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,518
But when you're at the
height of your notoriety,

228
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:18,001
and that's where we currently are,

229
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:19,975
you've got to enlarge your audience base.

230
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:21,380
You've got to go mainstream.

231
00:10:21,713 --> 00:10:25,134
No way, Artie, we don't have
the talent to pull it off.

232
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:26,947
You hired us for our looks, remember?

233
00:10:27,136 --> 00:10:31,849
None of us has any musical
training, except for Marky here.

234
00:10:32,182 --> 00:10:34,059
He's a musical genius.

235
00:10:34,393 --> 00:10:37,938
That's why he's the only
dead boy. Right, lover?

236
00:10:43,026 --> 00:10:44,026
Is that it?

237
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,406
Just some more photographs, please.

238
00:10:47,739 --> 00:10:49,283
(camera snaps)

239
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,660
Miss Verelli, special delivery.

240
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:55,539
Could you sign for this, please?

241
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:14,141
(eerie, dramatic music)

242
00:11:29,907 --> 00:11:32,743
(Gina screams)

243
00:11:33,076 --> 00:11:36,330
(Brooke breathes heavily)

244
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:40,626
(tense music)

245
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,337
(Gina screams)

246
00:11:45,047 --> 00:11:48,217
(dramatic music)

247
00:11:57,351 --> 00:12:00,604
(Gina breathes heavily)

248
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:06,652
(dramatic upbeat music)

249
00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:08,695
Thanks for the help, sis.

250
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,949
(intense, eerie music)

251
00:12:12,282 --> 00:12:15,369
You showed me how to really die.

252
00:12:39,768 --> 00:12:41,395
What's the matter, Gina?

253
00:12:42,646 --> 00:12:44,189
I have to go home.

254
00:12:44,523 --> 00:12:45,523
Brooksie needs me.

255
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,651
She needed you three years ago

256
00:12:47,985 --> 00:12:49,653
when you sashayed out of here,

257
00:12:49,987 --> 00:12:52,531
Miss High and Mighty Rockstar.

258
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:57,953
Brooksie, you're not even trying.

259
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:07,004
Could what she did have caused this?

260
00:13:09,214 --> 00:13:12,884
She's recovering from shock
due to massive blood loss.

261
00:13:13,218 --> 00:13:16,638
But the recovery is unusually
slow, we don't know why.

262
00:13:17,556 --> 00:13:19,099
She's intermittently comatose,

263
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:22,894
which could indicate anoxic brain damage.

264
00:13:23,228 --> 00:13:24,896
But it's more likely psychological

265
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,815
rather than physical in origin.

266
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:30,360
[Gina] You mean she
wants to be like this?

267
00:13:32,863 --> 00:13:36,074
It could be that she's
trying to do mentally

268
00:13:36,408 --> 00:13:38,285
what she failed to do physically.

269
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:42,748
Brooke, what were you thinking?

270
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:44,499
Don't ask her now.

271
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,251
When she needed her older sister,

272
00:13:46,585 --> 00:13:48,003
you were out playing the fool.

273
00:13:48,337 --> 00:13:51,214
Too busy for anybody but yourself.

274
00:13:51,548 --> 00:13:56,219
The others they buried
today died right away?

275
00:13:56,553 --> 00:13:59,306
Yes, six of them.

276
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:03,727
Two were airlifted to
County General with Brooke,

277
00:14:04,061 --> 00:14:05,604
but they didn't make it.

278
00:14:05,937 --> 00:14:06,937
Who found them?

279
00:14:07,105 --> 00:14:10,359
Neighbors heard them
playing a song, your song,

280
00:14:10,692 --> 00:14:11,902
on Brooksie's tape machine.

281
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:14,821
She listened to your songs all the time.

282
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:16,435
I told her they weren't any good

283
00:14:16,573 --> 00:14:19,159
but she wouldn't listen, oh no,

284
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:20,869
and look at her now.

285
00:14:25,123 --> 00:14:27,209
Old Witch-Hazel's on the warpath again.

286
00:14:28,627 --> 00:14:30,253
When are we gonna get outta here?

287
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:32,267
I'm really getting
bored of this pop scene.

288
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:34,925
Look, we're here for
moral support, okay?

289
00:14:35,258 --> 00:14:37,618
Starting tomorrow morning, we're
all taking a two-week break

290
00:14:37,678 --> 00:14:39,805
to help Gina get her head back together.

291
00:14:40,138 --> 00:14:42,599
Hey, Marky, how do you like this look?

292
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:44,643
A fan sent this to me.

293
00:14:44,976 --> 00:14:47,020
Think we can work it into the act?

294
00:14:47,979 --> 00:14:49,940
Are you paying any
attention to me at all?

295
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:51,983
Get rid of that stupid mask.

296
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:53,610
It's not going into the act.

297
00:14:53,944 --> 00:14:54,986
A two-week break?

298
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,947
Artie's not gonna like that.

299
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,164
Excuse me, I'm looking for Gina Verelli.

300
00:15:06,498 --> 00:15:07,874
What about her boyfriend?

301
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,208
What was his name?

302
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:10,219
Tony.

303
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:11,628
Tony Galletti.

304
00:15:11,962 --> 00:15:13,522
She mentioned him in all her letters.

305
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:16,383
Letters you never answered, not once.

306
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:18,802
And she wrote you every week,

307
00:15:19,136 --> 00:15:20,721
as if you counted for something.

308
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:22,514
Let me tell you.

309
00:15:22,848 --> 00:15:23,932
Hello, Gina.

310
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:25,952
I thought I'd come by and
see if you wanna take a walk.

311
00:15:25,976 --> 00:15:26,976
Mike!

312
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,814
Mike, it's so good to see you.

313
00:15:34,276 --> 00:15:35,276
Let's go.

314
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:43,910
Nothing like a nice,
friendly family reunion, huh?

315
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,288
I dunno, I haven't been here recently.

316
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:51,668
I haven't seen your aunt blow
up like that since you left.

317
00:15:52,002 --> 00:15:54,254
But you were there in
just the nick of time,

318
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:57,716
my knight in shining armor, like always.

319
00:15:58,049 --> 00:15:59,068
When I rescued your ball

320
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:01,092
from Little Miss Friendly's
backyard that one time?

321
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:01,895
(Gina laughs)

322
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:03,695
When you pulled Dave Manders off of me

323
00:16:03,805 --> 00:16:05,199
when he was attacking me in the driveway.

324
00:16:05,223 --> 00:16:07,267
I know and he's still
ticked off about that.

325
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:08,318
(Gina laughs)

326
00:16:08,518 --> 00:16:10,145
Miss Friendly and that dog of hers.

327
00:16:11,897 --> 00:16:12,897
You did that to her.

328
00:16:13,023 --> 00:16:14,183
[Mike] Hold on there, Tony.

329
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:17,110
Tony Galletti, you're the
one Brooke used to write about.

330
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:18,444
You almost killed her.

331
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,572
I know who you are, you're Bertha Beirut.

332
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,283
Knock it off, Tony.

333
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:25,284
You're gonna pay.

334
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:30,040
I can't believe that.

335
00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:33,376
I'm sorry, Gina, I know
he's taking this thing hard.

336
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,797
It's all right, he was angry
and he has every right to be.

337
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,610
I see the kid every week at church.

338
00:16:38,715 --> 00:16:39,883
He seems well-behaved there.

339
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:44,387
Reverend Saranko will set him straight.

340
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:47,349
I can't believe you're back in town.

341
00:16:47,682 --> 00:16:48,934
Well, it's me.

342
00:16:49,267 --> 00:16:50,267
Can we take a seat?

343
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,310
Sure, why not?

344
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:55,273
It's really good to see you again.

345
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:57,901
(Gina exhales)

346
00:16:58,235 --> 00:17:00,070
Sometimes, I do miss this town.

347
00:17:01,404 --> 00:17:03,524
It's not so bad as some
people would have you think.

348
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:05,492
Gina. Gina Verelli.

349
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:07,220
Reverend, what are you doing up here?

350
00:17:07,244 --> 00:17:08,364
Well, as a matter of fact,

351
00:17:08,537 --> 00:17:10,413
I'm on the way to your
house to visit Brooke.

352
00:17:10,747 --> 00:17:12,958
She's one of my lost sheep, just like you.

353
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,628
I heard it was a nice funeral.

354
00:17:16,962 --> 00:17:18,171
(Rachel clears throat)

355
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:19,139
Oh, I'm sorry.

356
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,924
Gina, this is my daughter, Rachel.

357
00:17:21,258 --> 00:17:22,759
Daddy, Gina and I were always

358
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:25,554
the best of friends in high
school. Weren't we, Gina?

359
00:17:25,887 --> 00:17:27,764
Was that Tony Galletti
I saw running off?

360
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:28,732
[Gina] Yeah.

361
00:17:28,932 --> 00:17:30,660
[Reverend] Is that boy
still in trouble again?

362
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:32,519
I'll tell you about it later, Reverend.

363
00:17:33,562 --> 00:17:36,064
Okay, Gina, I'll see
you at your house later.

364
00:17:36,398 --> 00:17:37,607
Bye, Reverend.

365
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:41,486
(suspenseful music)

366
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,784
This singing business is no good, Gina.

367
00:17:48,118 --> 00:17:50,287
I mean, you've gotta get out of it.

368
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,165
All the suicide and death,
it was just a gimmick.

369
00:17:54,499 --> 00:17:55,709
Something to get attention.

370
00:17:56,751 --> 00:17:59,421
No one was supposed to take it seriously.

371
00:17:59,754 --> 00:18:03,174
But now, it's like we used
this stuff to get to the top,

372
00:18:03,508 --> 00:18:05,218
somewhere I don't even...

373
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,350
Artie, what're you doing here?

374
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:13,402
Susie called me.

375
00:18:13,602 --> 00:18:14,762
She gave me this load of crap

376
00:18:14,853 --> 00:18:17,314
about you guys taking off
on a two-week vacation.

377
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:19,167
So I caught the first chopper up here.

378
00:18:19,316 --> 00:18:20,567
Now you tell me, honey,

379
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:23,028
you may not care very much
about your reputation,

380
00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:24,946
but I sure as hell care about mine.

381
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,282
Not a vacation, Artie.

382
00:18:27,616 --> 00:18:31,036
It's just that with all
these deaths and Brooksie,

383
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:33,705
we need some time to get
away and talk things over.

384
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:35,874
Talk? Lemme tell you about talk.

385
00:18:36,207 --> 00:18:38,418
There's five concert
dates, eight radio spots,

386
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:39,752
50 hours of air time

387
00:18:40,003 --> 00:18:41,843
bought and paid for
whether you use 'em or not,

388
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,465
and it's all down the drain.

389
00:18:44,382 --> 00:18:46,009
This wasn't something I planned.

390
00:18:46,343 --> 00:18:47,903
Well, you tell that to Sweeney, baby,

391
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:49,822
because if you go through
with this sabbatical,

392
00:18:49,846 --> 00:18:51,326
you'll be shopping for a new manager.

393
00:18:51,473 --> 00:18:53,099
Now, do I make myself clear?

394
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,979
Look, kid, you're the heart of this band.

395
00:18:58,313 --> 00:18:59,353
Now, Dana may be the soul,

396
00:18:59,522 --> 00:19:02,025
but you are the one that
keeps the blood pumping.

397
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:04,439
And I didn't pull you outta
this dump just to see you

398
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:07,405
turn your back on everything
you ever believed in.

399
00:19:07,739 --> 00:19:10,283
Now you change your mind,
I'll be conducting business

400
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,457
over in that old fleabag
office on Main Street.

401
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:13,786
Now, you remember that.

402
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:15,955
Ciao.

403
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:24,047
(car engine revving)
(rock music blaring on radio)

404
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:30,553
Your boss?

405
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:32,889
Manager. Same thing.

406
00:19:33,223 --> 00:19:34,557
He has an office on Main?

407
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:39,020
Yeah, next to Bill
Larson's travel agency.

408
00:19:39,354 --> 00:19:41,106
That's where I first met Artie,

409
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,942
looking for a job with Mr. Larson.

410
00:19:44,275 --> 00:19:46,945
And Artie was there
with the door wide open.

411
00:19:47,278 --> 00:19:50,115
He called me in and asked me
if I'd ever done any singing.

412
00:19:50,448 --> 00:19:52,742
I said, "Yeah, in the
church choir sometimes."

413
00:19:53,076 --> 00:19:54,619
And he hired you from that?

414
00:19:54,953 --> 00:19:57,455
He laughed and said the band
he would be putting together

415
00:19:57,789 --> 00:19:59,708
wouldn't be singing any hymns.

416
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,292
Boy, was he right about that.

417
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:03,419
What's this?

418
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:11,845
"Rest in peace, Gina Verelli.

419
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,178
It should've been you."

420
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:15,931
Signed, "A fan."

421
00:20:17,475 --> 00:20:19,686
Things are getting pretty bad, Gina.

422
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,855
That is why we're leaving here tomorrow

423
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,273
and I am taking Brooke.

424
00:20:24,858 --> 00:20:25,858
Tomorrow?

425
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,610
Where?

426
00:20:29,487 --> 00:20:31,114
You remember our cabin up north?

427
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:34,260
[Mike] Are you sure
that's such a good idea?

428
00:20:34,284 --> 00:20:35,964
We're going there for a couple of weeks,

429
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:38,413
just the band and me, and Brooksie.

430
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:40,707
That girl is not going anywhere.

431
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,792
Can she travel?

432
00:20:43,126 --> 00:20:44,646
There's no physical reason she can't

433
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:47,630
as long as proper medical
equipment is supplied.

434
00:20:47,964 --> 00:20:48,964
What's going on?

435
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:51,426
Where do you think you're
going to shanghai that girl to?

436
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,344
To the cabin.

437
00:20:53,678 --> 00:20:56,931
Jeff, our security liaison,
has arranged for a van

438
00:20:57,265 --> 00:20:59,184
large enough to accommodate
all her equipment.

439
00:20:59,517 --> 00:21:02,437
Make a list of whatever
other supplies she needs.

440
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:05,690
As your sister's guardian, I forbid it.

441
00:21:06,024 --> 00:21:07,358
You and your disgusting friends

442
00:21:07,692 --> 00:21:10,070
get out of my house right now.

443
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:11,571
Whose house?

444
00:21:11,905 --> 00:21:14,074
That's right, throw it in my face.

445
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:17,368
I've lived in this house for 12 years

446
00:21:17,702 --> 00:21:18,953
since your parents died.

447
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:20,455
I raised you kids.

448
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:22,874
I took care of this place.

449
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,459
And now that you're of age

450
00:21:24,793 --> 00:21:28,463
and Aunt Annie is no longer
trustee of your fund,

451
00:21:28,797 --> 00:21:31,216
so I'm out on my ear, is that it?

452
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:33,593
No, that isn't it at all.

453
00:21:34,677 --> 00:21:38,890
It is just that I administer
Brooke's inheritance now

454
00:21:39,224 --> 00:21:41,935
and I need to get away
and be with her alone,

455
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:43,645
just for a little while.

456
00:21:43,978 --> 00:21:47,607
But you are welcome to stay here, quietly,

457
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:49,234
for as long as you would like.

458
00:21:51,486 --> 00:21:53,571
Is there anything else she'll need?

459
00:21:53,905 --> 00:21:56,616
She'll need regular checkups
at a full care facility.

460
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,159
There's one in the town.

461
00:21:58,493 --> 00:21:59,828
Now please, go make that list.

462
00:22:03,498 --> 00:22:06,626
Aunt Annie, please don't hate me.

463
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:11,506
I have to understand what happened.

464
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,425
Annie, could I have a few
minutes alone with Gina?

465
00:22:16,427 --> 00:22:17,427
Okay? Thank you.

466
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:22,433
Gina, I feel moved by the spirit

467
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:24,686
to ask you to reconsider
what you're doing.

468
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:27,981
Do you feel at this point
in time that it's prudent

469
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:31,276
to remove your sister from the
bosom of her loving family?

470
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:33,361
I am her family.

471
00:22:33,695 --> 00:22:37,031
So you are, but you haven't
been around much, have you?

472
00:22:37,365 --> 00:22:40,785
No, I mean her extended
family. Family of God.

473
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,122
You think that we, the
whole band, we're pied pipers

474
00:22:44,455 --> 00:22:47,542
leading these children to
suicide and sickness, don't you?

475
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:51,504
I think that you love Brooke very much.

476
00:22:53,256 --> 00:22:57,802
But that doesn't mean what
you're planning is right or good.

477
00:22:58,136 --> 00:22:59,136
You hurt her once.

478
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:00,930
Please, don't do it again.

479
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:04,475
If Brooke did what she
did because of my music,

480
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:06,686
then she doesn't understand it.

481
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,605
She doesn't even know me.

482
00:23:09,606 --> 00:23:12,025
Maybe it was your fault.

483
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:14,694
Maybe she's messed up by what
you think is right or wrong,

484
00:23:15,028 --> 00:23:16,362
everyone else in this town is.

485
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:18,336
"Reverend says this, Reverend says that."

486
00:23:18,656 --> 00:23:20,783
You twist people.

487
00:23:21,117 --> 00:23:23,119
Maybe that's what drove her to it.

488
00:23:23,453 --> 00:23:26,539
I know that Annie has
diverted funds from the trust

489
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:28,124
to the church, to you.

490
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:29,898
If Brooke were to stay here and die,

491
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,999
then Annie would get a lotta
money and so would you.

492
00:23:32,045 --> 00:23:34,172
Maybe that's what you want.

493
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,302
(Gina sobs)

494
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:42,472
I am so sorry.

495
00:23:43,598 --> 00:23:45,516
I am so sorry.
- I know, I know.

496
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,370
That was your anger speaking, not you.

497
00:23:47,518 --> 00:23:48,603
I didn't mean it.

498
00:23:49,938 --> 00:23:52,398
I've had worse things said about me.

499
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:54,943
At least you didn't say
my sermons were dull.

500
00:23:56,653 --> 00:23:57,904
I do have one request.

501
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:02,158
Your cabin is next to the church camp,

502
00:24:03,493 --> 00:24:05,745
may I have permission to
visit the little lamb?

503
00:24:07,622 --> 00:24:09,082
(Dana chuckles)

504
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:12,377
Whoa, that reverend guy is intense.

505
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,755
Hey, that's my father
you're talking about.

506
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:17,215
(Mark burps)

507
00:24:17,548 --> 00:24:20,927
(eerie music)

508
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:25,640
(tense music)

509
00:24:40,363 --> 00:24:43,032
(dramatic music)

510
00:24:49,205 --> 00:24:50,498
All I'm saying is...

511
00:24:51,374 --> 00:24:53,126
That's right, I wanna reschedule.

512
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:55,753
I know you've done it for
plenty of other groups.

513
00:24:57,005 --> 00:24:59,465
Hey, this is standard
industry courtesy, man.

514
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:03,678
Look, read my lips: Gina Verelli is sick.

515
00:25:04,012 --> 00:25:05,972
Female thing, you know?

516
00:25:06,306 --> 00:25:07,390
No, she's Bertha Beirut.

517
00:25:07,724 --> 00:25:09,434
Yes, I know you can't tell the difference,

518
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:11,477
that's why I'm on the payroll.

519
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:13,521
(tense music)

520
00:25:13,855 --> 00:25:17,066
Hey, I don't care, you can check
all the care units in town.

521
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,520
She's sick, I'm telling you.

522
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:19,818
(tense music)

523
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:22,739
Look, I didn't want this to
turn into some big legal thing.

524
00:25:23,072 --> 00:25:24,133
I wanted to keep it friendly,

525
00:25:24,157 --> 00:25:25,533
but we got our rights, you know.

526
00:25:26,451 --> 00:25:28,703
Now, you read the fine print
in that contract, Joseph.

527
00:25:29,037 --> 00:25:30,514
There's a little clause
in there that says,

528
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:33,041
"That in the event of
an accident or illness."

529
00:25:35,293 --> 00:25:36,794
I want that rescheduled.

530
00:25:37,128 --> 00:25:40,006
Now, you call me when you
know the date. Ciao, pally.

531
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,633
(phone bangs)

532
00:25:44,802 --> 00:25:45,802
Sheila.

533
00:25:47,055 --> 00:25:48,055
Sheila?

534
00:25:49,557 --> 00:25:50,557
Crap!

535
00:25:51,392 --> 00:25:55,188
Just got to do it all yourself,
Artie, just like always.

536
00:25:59,442 --> 00:26:00,442
What a night.

537
00:26:02,111 --> 00:26:03,404
(cabinet drawer thuds)

538
00:26:03,738 --> 00:26:04,738
(cork squeaks)

539
00:26:04,906 --> 00:26:05,907
What a night.

540
00:26:11,454 --> 00:26:13,623
These girls are gonna
be the death of me yet.

541
00:26:14,957 --> 00:26:17,001
(tense, eerie music)

542
00:26:17,335 --> 00:26:18,335
Terrible.

543
00:26:26,761 --> 00:26:29,305
(tense, eerie music)

544
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:33,351
The jerk who made this
crap sure made a bundle.

545
00:26:35,686 --> 00:26:36,938
Man, look at me.

546
00:26:41,526 --> 00:26:45,405
Yama Honda, memo: get the
girls a movie contract.

547
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:48,783
(tense, eerie music)

548
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:58,835
Hey, pal, what's your problem?

549
00:26:59,168 --> 00:27:00,795
Can't you see this is a private party?

550
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:03,548
Leave your card.

551
00:27:03,881 --> 00:27:06,241
You want an audition, come back
during normal business hours

552
00:27:06,467 --> 00:27:07,467
which this ain't.

553
00:27:08,177 --> 00:27:10,763
Well, come on, scram. Vamoose outta here.

554
00:27:11,722 --> 00:27:13,450
Some heavy-duty drinking
is about to commence

555
00:27:13,474 --> 00:27:14,809
and it's gonna be solo.

556
00:27:15,143 --> 00:27:18,688
(nail gun clacks)
(Artie screams)

557
00:27:19,021 --> 00:27:21,399
(Gina screams)

558
00:27:25,987 --> 00:27:29,240
Honey, what's wrong? I
heard you screaming next door.

559
00:27:29,574 --> 00:27:31,117
Oh, bad dreams again?

560
00:27:33,453 --> 00:27:35,997
Dana, what is the matter with me?

561
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,499
Honey, you're asking the wrong person.

562
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:40,543
Just ask anyone of my three exes

563
00:27:40,877 --> 00:27:42,420
or any one of my four shrinks.

564
00:27:43,463 --> 00:27:44,463
Am I going nuts?

565
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:46,924
I can't take much more of this.

566
00:27:47,258 --> 00:27:49,302
Honey, nobody could.

567
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:51,971
That's what this little trip
tomorrow's all about, right?

568
00:27:52,305 --> 00:27:54,974
So that you and the rest
of this cockamamie band

569
00:27:55,308 --> 00:27:57,477
can get a better grip on reality.

570
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:58,810
Now look, here.

571
00:27:59,437 --> 00:28:01,564
Just lie back.

572
00:28:01,898 --> 00:28:04,150
Think about the woods.

573
00:28:05,109 --> 00:28:06,319
Kicking back on the porch.

574
00:28:07,445 --> 00:28:08,821
Skinny-dipping in the lake.

575
00:28:09,864 --> 00:28:11,782
All that good stuff.

576
00:28:12,116 --> 00:28:15,661
And before you know it,
we'll be there, okay?

577
00:28:16,954 --> 00:28:18,748
Now, goodnight.

578
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:20,081
Goodnight.

579
00:28:44,482 --> 00:28:47,652
(dramatic music)

580
00:29:15,471 --> 00:29:17,974
(Gina screams)

581
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:25,481
Honey, what's wrong? I heard
you screaming next door.

582
00:29:25,815 --> 00:29:27,024
Oh, bad dreams again?

583
00:29:34,699 --> 00:29:36,492
What's going on?

584
00:29:36,826 --> 00:29:38,911
What, are you gonna
stay in here all night?

585
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:41,414
As long as she needs me, yeah.

586
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:43,207
You're not her mother, you know?

587
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,250
Just a friend.

588
00:29:54,844 --> 00:29:57,638
[Susie] Can't wait, at
last some time to ourselves.

589
00:29:57,972 --> 00:30:00,099
What are you planning on doing up there?

590
00:30:00,433 --> 00:30:03,394
You got enough junk here
to restock Hearst Castle.

591
00:30:03,728 --> 00:30:05,088
I'm just planning on a good time

592
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:07,189
and I need this stuff to help me.

593
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:08,733
What's in your bag, Amy?

594
00:30:10,568 --> 00:30:12,903
Sorry, Nancy.

595
00:30:14,238 --> 00:30:15,364
Ooh, look.

596
00:30:15,698 --> 00:30:17,617
The travel assortment.

597
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:21,245
Ah, jeez. You know we're
not gonna perform up there.

598
00:30:21,579 --> 00:30:23,623
You don't need the props.

599
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:24,956
These are not props.

600
00:30:30,504 --> 00:30:31,264
I thought we were heading

601
00:30:31,464 --> 00:30:34,634
for a nice, quiet, relaxing two weeks.

602
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:36,636
Not World War III.

603
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:39,764
Hey, maybe she wants to get
some hunting in, you know?

604
00:30:40,097 --> 00:30:43,017
You might run into some
wild animals up there.

605
00:30:44,018 --> 00:30:47,438
I know, I'm packing a rod for the trip.

606
00:30:48,731 --> 00:30:49,815
Oh, yeah?

607
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:51,525
And I got a holster.

608
00:30:51,859 --> 00:30:53,361
This could work out.

609
00:30:54,278 --> 00:30:57,281
I hope you burn in hell for this.

610
00:30:57,615 --> 00:30:58,615
Ignore us, that's right.

611
00:30:58,866 --> 00:31:02,119
Take your sister off to do
devil's work to finish the job.

612
00:31:02,453 --> 00:31:04,413
That's right, load up your things.

613
00:31:04,747 --> 00:31:06,415
Don't leave a single thing behind.

614
00:31:06,749 --> 00:31:08,668
I don't want anything of yours

615
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:11,879
left in this house to contaminate my home.

616
00:31:12,213 --> 00:31:13,213
Shut up, Annie.

617
00:31:14,465 --> 00:31:17,259
You're overwrought, you
don't know what you're doing.

618
00:31:17,593 --> 00:31:19,762
This sorta thing can't
help Brooksie, Annie.

619
00:31:20,096 --> 00:31:21,555
Now, go to the house.

620
00:31:21,889 --> 00:31:24,642
(Annie sobs)

621
00:31:24,975 --> 00:31:26,435
Gina, I'm sorry.

622
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:30,690
This whole thing's been a
strain on your Aunt Annie.

623
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:32,775
We're going away, Auntie.

624
00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:36,737
You know, she really loves
you both like daughters.

625
00:31:37,905 --> 00:31:39,240
I know, Uncle Jim.

626
00:31:39,573 --> 00:31:41,200
I really think she needs you now.

627
00:31:41,534 --> 00:31:42,534
I'm going.

628
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,496
But first, I thought I'd
better give you these.

629
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,416
Kinda hard to open a cabin without 'em.

630
00:31:48,749 --> 00:31:49,749
Thanks.

631
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,299
Come on, Brooke, let's
show 'em what we can do.

632
00:31:57,633 --> 00:31:59,218
Little exercise, okay?

633
00:31:59,552 --> 00:32:02,263
Yeah, to the car on my own two feet.

634
00:32:02,596 --> 00:32:07,268
Come on.

635
00:32:07,601 --> 00:32:08,894
That's it, girl.

636
00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:15,192
Wait, Gina, we're going on vacation.

637
00:32:15,526 --> 00:32:16,526
Are you coming with us?

638
00:32:16,736 --> 00:32:17,736
Are you kidding?

639
00:32:17,778 --> 00:32:19,155
Miss a vacation with my sis?

640
00:32:19,488 --> 00:32:21,282
Wild horses couldn't keep me away.

641
00:32:21,615 --> 00:32:22,615
Now, get in there.

642
00:32:25,286 --> 00:32:27,621
The change of environment
will be good for Brooke,

643
00:32:27,955 --> 00:32:32,626
but she needs absolute
peace, quiet and rest.

644
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,796
We can have no repeats of
the scene we just witnessed.

645
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,757
I want you to understand that.

646
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,967
We are all interested in her welfare.

647
00:32:41,343 --> 00:32:43,583
The nearest suitable treatment
facility for your sister

648
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,890
is 150 miles from the cabins.

649
00:32:46,223 --> 00:32:48,223
I'll bring her there every
other day for treatment.

650
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:49,509
And depending on her response,

651
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:53,189
I'll bring her back the same
day or I'll stay overnight.

652
00:32:53,522 --> 00:32:56,150
The van is at your
disposal, we don't need it.

653
00:32:56,484 --> 00:32:59,779
(high energy rock music)

654
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:02,198
She'll be there to
welcome us when we arrive.

655
00:33:02,531 --> 00:33:04,867
No way, I don't even
know where we're going.

656
00:33:05,201 --> 00:33:08,621
Her? She's got the homing
instincts of a carrier pigeon.

657
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:12,208
Yeah, she's a nice-looking
birdie, all right.

658
00:33:12,541 --> 00:33:14,668
Yeah, and just as full of shit.

659
00:33:18,672 --> 00:33:22,009
(high energy rock music)

660
00:33:35,105 --> 00:33:36,105
Alone with you at last.

661
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,567
Ha. Whatever it is you gotta
say, you better make it quick

662
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:40,110
'cause we're outta here, pal.

663
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,363
What's on your windshield?

664
00:33:51,664 --> 00:33:52,664
What is it?

665
00:33:52,873 --> 00:33:54,250
Fan mail from some flounder?

666
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:57,920
Lyrics to "Nail Gun Murders."

667
00:33:58,254 --> 00:33:59,630
Nail gun murders?

668
00:33:59,964 --> 00:34:01,632
One of our finest syncopated efforts

669
00:34:01,966 --> 00:34:03,676
about a psycho with a nail gun.

670
00:34:06,804 --> 00:34:09,557
Maybe some crazy fan left it there.

671
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:12,017
Oh, probably Karen, I just saw her leave.

672
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:14,770
She's that super groupie
you told me about, right?

673
00:34:15,104 --> 00:34:16,397
Forget her.

674
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,524
Forget her, let's talk about you.

675
00:34:18,858 --> 00:34:20,526
The fact that you're going away

676
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,528
and I won't see you again for a while.

677
00:34:24,446 --> 00:34:25,531
Wanna give you something.

678
00:34:27,491 --> 00:34:29,535
My phone number, in
case you need something

679
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:33,080
and, you know, you don't
wanna disturb your aunt.

680
00:34:33,414 --> 00:34:35,014
You do have a phone up there, don't you?

681
00:34:35,082 --> 00:34:36,082
One.

682
00:34:37,626 --> 00:34:40,296
Your phone number, are you kidding?

683
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:43,382
555-7028.

684
00:34:43,716 --> 00:34:45,050
How could I ever forget that?

685
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:53,684
Bye, Gina.

686
00:34:54,018 --> 00:34:55,018
See you later.

687
00:35:01,984 --> 00:35:03,986
They're going to throw us out.

688
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,779
(car engine roars)

689
00:35:06,113 --> 00:35:06,747
Don't worry.

690
00:35:06,947 --> 00:35:09,700
There are ways of interfering
with plans like that.

691
00:35:11,201 --> 00:35:12,912
This is bitchin'.

692
00:35:16,957 --> 00:35:19,460
I can stand two weeks here.

693
00:35:20,794 --> 00:35:25,591
Peace, quiet, tranquility,
sun, sand, woods,

694
00:35:27,134 --> 00:35:28,134
Frankenstein?

695
00:35:29,011 --> 00:35:30,220
No, that's Elmo.

696
00:35:30,554 --> 00:35:32,681
He's the handyman around
here for all the cabins.

697
00:35:33,015 --> 00:35:34,934
Has been for as long as I can remember.

698
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:39,438
He is retarded or something,
or at least a little weird.

699
00:35:39,772 --> 00:35:41,941
Hey, Elmo, how you doing?

700
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:43,859
Hello, Miss Gina.

701
00:35:44,193 --> 00:35:45,553
I'm surprised you recognized me.

702
00:35:45,819 --> 00:35:47,279
It's been over a century.

703
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:52,409
Oh no, Miss Gina, I've seen
you in the papers, on TV,

704
00:35:52,993 --> 00:35:55,663
and I think I got all your albums.

705
00:35:55,996 --> 00:35:58,958
I play 'em all the time, over and over.

706
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:00,834
That's nice, Elmo.

707
00:36:01,168 --> 00:36:02,771
My friends and I are gonna be staying here

708
00:36:02,795 --> 00:36:03,915
for a couple of weeks and...

709
00:36:04,088 --> 00:36:05,088
I know, ma'am.

710
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:07,091
Your uncle told me everything.

711
00:36:07,424 --> 00:36:09,093
I cleaned the cabin this morning.

712
00:36:09,426 --> 00:36:10,636
I got it clean as a whistle.

713
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:11,970
Let me show you.

714
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,265
That'll be all right, Elmo.

715
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,599
My uncle called you?

716
00:36:17,518 --> 00:36:20,437
I'm happy to see Miss
Brooke up and about.

717
00:36:20,771 --> 00:36:22,856
No, ma'am, he told me in person.

718
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,275
I heard about the accident.

719
00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:28,070
I was at the funeral yesterday

720
00:36:28,404 --> 00:36:30,823
and he told me to double
time it back up here.

721
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:32,199
Okay.

722
00:36:32,533 --> 00:36:34,743
Susie, let me take you up there

723
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:36,537
and show you where we're gonna stay.

724
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:37,870
I'll help you.

725
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:39,808
I clean the cabin real special
just for you, Miss Gina.

726
00:36:39,832 --> 00:36:40,874
No.

727
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:43,293
Elmo, that will be fine.

728
00:36:43,627 --> 00:36:45,467
I'm sure you have plenty
of other things to do.

729
00:36:45,546 --> 00:36:47,423
I'll take care of our guests myself.

730
00:36:48,882 --> 00:36:51,051
I knew this was my kind of place.

731
00:36:54,263 --> 00:36:55,264
Okay, guys.

732
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,895
Susie, you and Amy will be
up ahead and to your left.

733
00:37:02,229 --> 00:37:04,273
Okay, Rambo, I get the bed.

734
00:37:04,606 --> 00:37:07,401
Dana, you're straight ahead
in the room next to Brooke's.

735
00:37:07,735 --> 00:37:10,154
And you guys are out in the garage.

736
00:37:10,487 --> 00:37:12,781
Uh, ha, ha, ha. Congratulations, Jeffy.

737
00:37:13,115 --> 00:37:14,950
You just got the room to yourself.

738
00:37:15,284 --> 00:37:17,494
(Gina sighs)

739
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:37,014
(suspenseful music)

740
00:37:44,104 --> 00:37:45,707
Come on, Brooke, you
need to stretch those legs

741
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:46,774
after all that driving.

742
00:37:47,107 --> 00:37:48,667
Let's take a look-see around here, huh?

743
00:37:48,817 --> 00:37:49,860
How's that sound to you?

744
00:37:50,194 --> 00:37:52,029
- Yeah, it's very pretty here.
- Come on.

745
00:37:54,198 --> 00:37:55,657
They've got the right idea.

746
00:37:55,991 --> 00:37:57,701
How about a little tour for yours truly?

747
00:37:58,035 --> 00:37:59,755
I'd like to get to know
the lay of the land,

748
00:37:59,787 --> 00:38:02,164
just in case anybody tries
to bug you girls up here.

749
00:38:05,709 --> 00:38:07,628
Well, there's not
much to see around here.

750
00:38:07,961 --> 00:38:09,254
There's not much here.

751
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:11,215
I guess that's the whole point.

752
00:38:11,548 --> 00:38:15,094
A house, a lake, a barn, and
a lot of woods everywhere.

753
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:16,427
That's about it.

754
00:38:16,512 --> 00:38:17,554
- The barn?
- Yeah.

755
00:38:20,057 --> 00:38:22,601
Anything of interest
about it I should know?

756
00:38:22,935 --> 00:38:24,603
[Gina] It's just a rotting old barn.

757
00:38:30,484 --> 00:38:32,277
So, do you wanna go in the barn?

758
00:38:51,255 --> 00:38:53,048
Oh, this is a bad
place. Can we go, please?

759
00:38:53,382 --> 00:38:54,734
Come on, what's the matter, honey?

760
00:38:54,758 --> 00:38:55,878
It's just an empty old barn.

761
00:38:56,176 --> 00:38:57,176
No.

762
00:38:57,344 --> 00:38:59,447
I bet you played in here when
you were a little girl, huh?

763
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:02,182
No, it's a bad place.

764
00:39:02,516 --> 00:39:05,769
Let me out. (screams)

765
00:39:06,103 --> 00:39:06,862
Brooke!

766
00:39:07,062 --> 00:39:08,062
Brooke!

767
00:39:08,981 --> 00:39:10,149
What was that all about?

768
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:12,860
I felt... it's not good in there.

769
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,589
Your medallion, you must've
dropped it in the barn.

770
00:39:16,613 --> 00:39:17,289
I can go get it for you.

771
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:19,241
No, please don't go in there.

772
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:21,618
I just wanna go home.

773
00:39:22,911 --> 00:39:23,911
Perhaps you're right.

774
00:39:24,121 --> 00:39:26,540
We've had enough excitement
for one day, huh?

775
00:39:26,874 --> 00:39:28,041
Besides, it's getting late.

776
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:29,375
Okay, let's go.

777
00:39:31,628 --> 00:39:33,547
And this is the way back home.

778
00:39:33,881 --> 00:39:36,675
I'm not really quite sure
what you're looking for.

779
00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:38,135
Who knows?

780
00:39:38,468 --> 00:39:40,137
There's weirdos everywhere these days.

781
00:39:42,389 --> 00:39:43,765
What's that over there?

782
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:45,099
That's Elmo's shack.

783
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:47,060
He stays there when he works here.

784
00:39:47,394 --> 00:39:50,355
I think he has a little
place in town, too.

785
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:53,483
He stays there on the
off-seasons, during weekends.

786
00:39:53,817 --> 00:39:54,860
He lives in that shack?

787
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,573
I don't see any phone
lines or TV antennas.

788
00:40:00,908 --> 00:40:02,201
There's not even a car there.

789
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:04,453
I think he goes into town for supplies

790
00:40:04,786 --> 00:40:05,786
during the peak season.

791
00:40:05,871 --> 00:40:07,956
He thumbs, lot of locals
will give him a ride.

792
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:11,919
(Karen screaming)

793
00:40:24,848 --> 00:40:25,848
Oh my God.

794
00:40:28,477 --> 00:40:29,477
Hi.

795
00:40:30,938 --> 00:40:31,956
I knew she'd beat us here.

796
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,980
I just knew it.

797
00:40:33,148 --> 00:40:35,525
Looks like fun, you guys,
but if Dana catches you...

798
00:40:36,693 --> 00:40:38,195
Dana has caught him.

799
00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:40,906
You, get back to our cabin

800
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,616
and you get this slut outta here.

801
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:43,950
What? It's late.

802
00:40:44,076 --> 00:40:45,345
What am I supposed to do with her?

803
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:46,045
That's not my problem.

804
00:40:46,245 --> 00:40:48,413
Just do what we pay you to do.

805
00:40:48,747 --> 00:40:51,107
You remember when mom used to
tan your hide for coming late?

806
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,690
I ought to do that to you right now.

807
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,295
Really? You're gonna spank me?

808
00:40:55,629 --> 00:40:57,172
Hey, what're we waiting for?

809
00:40:57,506 --> 00:40:59,091
Hold on, wild man.

810
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:02,177
You get that bitch
outta here permanently.

811
00:41:08,475 --> 00:41:09,726
Okay, where'd you park?

812
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,353
Nowhere, Benson.

813
00:41:11,687 --> 00:41:13,355
Shit car chucked about 40 miles back,

814
00:41:13,689 --> 00:41:17,359
thumbed it the rest of the way and hiked.

815
00:41:17,693 --> 00:41:19,569
I've got what it takes
to get where I wanna be.

816
00:41:19,903 --> 00:41:21,780
It's 10 miles from
the nearest paved road.

817
00:41:22,114 --> 00:41:23,448
You hiked 10 miles to here?

818
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,459
Come on.

819
00:41:25,659 --> 00:41:27,995
Far as I can figure, you're
over the property line.

820
00:41:28,328 --> 00:41:31,248
Just follow your nose another
half a mile to the retreat.

821
00:41:31,581 --> 00:41:33,559
That's it, you're now in
the door of Cadillacville.

822
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:34,852
I'm sure you'll think of something.

823
00:41:34,876 --> 00:41:35,636
Well, thank you, Jeff,

824
00:41:35,836 --> 00:41:38,630
but I've been in grimmer situations.

825
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:45,053
(suspenseful music)

826
00:41:50,267 --> 00:41:51,810
Someone there?

827
00:41:52,144 --> 00:41:53,144
Hello?

828
00:41:56,231 --> 00:41:57,232
I'm hearing things.

829
00:41:57,566 --> 00:41:59,860
(Karen sighs)

830
00:42:03,697 --> 00:42:05,866
Argh, get rid of this shit.

831
00:42:08,744 --> 00:42:09,744
All right.

832
00:42:17,878 --> 00:42:21,381
(suspenseful music)

833
00:42:24,593 --> 00:42:26,970
(tense music)

834
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,480
Jeff?

835
00:42:39,191 --> 00:42:40,191
Jeff?

836
00:42:41,943 --> 00:42:42,943
Is that you?

837
00:42:44,446 --> 00:42:48,533
Jeff, I wasn't gonna head
back to the cabin or anything.

838
00:42:48,867 --> 00:42:50,660
I'm not an outdoor person, you know,

839
00:42:50,994 --> 00:42:52,329
the woods all kinda look alike.

840
00:42:53,872 --> 00:42:55,749
I guess I just got kinda turned around.

841
00:42:58,043 --> 00:42:59,419
Jeff?

842
00:42:59,753 --> 00:43:02,255
(suspenseful music)

843
00:43:02,589 --> 00:43:03,673
Jeff?

844
00:43:04,007 --> 00:43:07,386
(suspenseful music)

845
00:43:18,688 --> 00:43:21,775
(tense music)

846
00:43:39,668 --> 00:43:44,589
(dramatic music)
(Karen screams)

847
00:43:45,882 --> 00:43:48,176
(wolf howls)

848
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:51,263
(tense music)

849
00:43:51,596 --> 00:43:53,473
(Karen coughs)

850
00:43:53,807 --> 00:43:56,852
(tense music)

851
00:43:58,019 --> 00:43:59,521
Look at this one.

852
00:44:00,981 --> 00:44:01,981
Look!

853
00:44:02,732 --> 00:44:04,234
You know this song?

854
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:08,029
(tense music)

855
00:44:08,363 --> 00:44:09,363
Say it!

856
00:44:10,699 --> 00:44:13,285
"In her mind, she saw the scaffold..."

857
00:44:13,618 --> 00:44:15,328
(Karen groans)

858
00:44:15,662 --> 00:44:18,707
(tense music)

859
00:44:22,794 --> 00:44:27,674
(Karen groans)
(tense music)

860
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:36,141
(pensive music)

861
00:45:26,066 --> 00:45:28,485
(tense music)

862
00:45:33,949 --> 00:45:36,618
(ducks quacking)

863
00:45:38,078 --> 00:45:42,457
(heavy breathing)

864
00:45:48,964 --> 00:45:51,258
So come on, be a sport.

865
00:45:51,591 --> 00:45:52,591
Forget it.

866
00:45:52,884 --> 00:45:54,052
Oh, please.

867
00:45:54,386 --> 00:45:57,013
You're not gonna let me go in
there all by myself, are you?

868
00:45:58,056 --> 00:45:59,216
You're wasting your breath.

869
00:45:59,432 --> 00:46:01,226
I'm not going swimming and that's final.

870
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:03,895
I'm only wasting my breath?

871
00:46:05,689 --> 00:46:06,689
Don't you like me?

872
00:46:06,815 --> 00:46:09,401
Oh God, I think I'm gonna puke.

873
00:46:09,734 --> 00:46:12,153
I swear, that little
tramp is worse than...

874
00:46:12,487 --> 00:46:13,738
Than you?

875
00:46:14,656 --> 00:46:15,656
Whoo.

876
00:46:16,783 --> 00:46:17,783
Hey!

877
00:46:17,993 --> 00:46:19,619
What's this? Rural delivery?

878
00:46:19,953 --> 00:46:20,953
Read it.

879
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:25,000
Oh, yeah, that hang thing
we did. What about it?

880
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:28,086
Oh, yeah, you know, it's
got a really good beat

881
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,713
but I can't dance to it, man.

882
00:46:30,046 --> 00:46:32,882
You know, I give it, like, a 63.

883
00:46:33,216 --> 00:46:34,896
Did you leave that
in my room last night?

884
00:46:35,135 --> 00:46:36,678
Why would I leave this in your room?

885
00:46:37,012 --> 00:46:38,012
Somebody did.

886
00:46:38,263 --> 00:46:41,141
I found one yesterday on the
van, too. "Nail Gun Murder."

887
00:46:41,474 --> 00:46:42,601
Somebody's doing this.

888
00:46:42,934 --> 00:46:45,312
Gina, it's like
somebody's idea of a joke.

889
00:46:45,645 --> 00:46:46,685
Yeah, well, I don't know

890
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:48,398
what's supposed to be funny about it.

891
00:46:49,566 --> 00:46:51,735
This is your last chance.

892
00:46:52,068 --> 00:46:54,571
There's other fish to fry
around here, you know?

893
00:46:54,904 --> 00:46:56,489
Good. I'll get the Crisco.

894
00:47:15,216 --> 00:47:17,427
I'm glad to see Brooke
is feeling so much better.

895
00:47:17,761 --> 00:47:20,013
Yeah, Susie insisted
everyone go swimming.

896
00:47:20,347 --> 00:47:21,848
Brooke wanted to come and watch.

897
00:47:22,182 --> 00:47:23,993
She used to be a swimmer
in high school, wasn't she?

898
00:47:24,017 --> 00:47:25,697
[Gina] State finals, two years in a row.

899
00:47:25,977 --> 00:47:27,604
Well, could be stimulating for her,

900
00:47:27,937 --> 00:47:30,190
speed up her desire for recovery.

901
00:47:30,523 --> 00:47:32,067
But you didn't call me over here

902
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,880
for an update on Brooke, now did you?

903
00:47:44,496 --> 00:47:47,040
Looks like the sort of
trash you people turn out.

904
00:47:47,374 --> 00:47:49,292
So you've never seen
those papers before?

905
00:47:51,002 --> 00:47:53,064
Even if I did, do you think
I'd leave that kind of stuff

906
00:47:53,088 --> 00:47:55,131
lying around where Brooke could see it?

907
00:47:55,465 --> 00:47:58,134
It's what caused her
present condition, remember?

908
00:48:03,723 --> 00:48:06,434
(heavy breathing)

909
00:48:06,768 --> 00:48:07,768
Hi, Marky.

910
00:48:08,478 --> 00:48:09,478
Hi, Suze.

911
00:48:10,397 --> 00:48:11,690
What's happening?

912
00:48:12,732 --> 00:48:14,109
Nothing much.

913
00:48:14,442 --> 00:48:16,152
That's the problem.

914
00:48:16,486 --> 00:48:18,405
Nobody wants to go swimming with me

915
00:48:18,738 --> 00:48:21,157
and I think you should always
swim on a buddy system,

916
00:48:21,491 --> 00:48:23,535
don't you?
(Mark laughs nervously)

917
00:48:23,868 --> 00:48:25,161
Would you like to be my buddy?

918
00:48:26,454 --> 00:48:27,494
[Mark] I don't think so.

919
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:28,915
No, not this time.

920
00:48:29,249 --> 00:48:33,795
Oh, come on, things are
always more fun when you're wet.

921
00:48:34,129 --> 00:48:37,674
Well, I'll take a rain check, okay?

922
00:48:38,007 --> 00:48:39,008
Come on, don't be so...

923
00:48:39,342 --> 00:48:41,344
Hey! He said no.

924
00:48:41,678 --> 00:48:42,971
Now beat it.

925
00:48:43,304 --> 00:48:44,597
What are you, his mother?

926
00:48:44,931 --> 00:48:47,142
Does he need your permission
to come out and play?

927
00:48:47,475 --> 00:48:48,744
No, he doesn't need permission.

928
00:48:48,768 --> 00:48:50,854
He needs to know how to swim, got it?

929
00:48:51,187 --> 00:48:52,230
He never learned.

930
00:48:52,564 --> 00:48:54,764
Now, would you please stop
embarrassing him and yourself

931
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:58,236
and anyone else forced to
watch this revolting spectacle?

932
00:48:59,154 --> 00:49:01,281
All right. Stay here.

933
00:49:01,614 --> 00:49:03,366
Take root for all I care.

934
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,827
You're all a bunch of
freaking losers, anyway.

935
00:49:07,203 --> 00:49:09,664
At least I know how to have a good time.

936
00:49:09,998 --> 00:49:12,167
I'm going to the other part of the lake.

937
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,086
I'm going in by myself.

938
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,420
Susie, hold it.

939
00:49:16,671 --> 00:49:17,671
Hold it, I'll go change.

940
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,079
You can't go in there by
yourself, it could be dangerous.

941
00:49:20,216 --> 00:49:21,509
Don't do me any favors.

942
00:49:21,843 --> 00:49:24,846
But if you need to wash the
mold off from these fossils,

943
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:28,183
I'll be down there enjoying myself.

944
00:49:28,516 --> 00:49:30,351
Susie, it could be dangerous.

945
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:32,812
Could be dangerous.

946
00:49:33,146 --> 00:49:36,524
(eerie music)

947
00:49:39,235 --> 00:49:41,488
(Susie screams)

948
00:49:41,821 --> 00:49:44,866
(dramatic music)

949
00:49:50,205 --> 00:49:52,499
Hey, what are you doing, huh?

950
00:49:52,832 --> 00:49:54,393
What the hell do you think you're doing?

951
00:49:54,417 --> 00:49:56,211
What is going on here?

952
00:49:56,544 --> 00:49:57,921
What are you doing?

953
00:49:58,963 --> 00:50:00,757
What were you screaming about?

954
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:01,850
He attacked me.

955
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:03,527
He came outta nowhere and he grabbed me.

956
00:50:03,551 --> 00:50:04,185
Over there?

957
00:50:04,385 --> 00:50:06,065
Yeah, I don't know,
somewhere over there.

958
00:50:06,721 --> 00:50:08,574
Well, lucky for you, since
you were about to traipse

959
00:50:08,598 --> 00:50:11,142
half naked through a patch of poison oak.

960
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:14,229
Would you like to hit him some more now?

961
00:50:14,562 --> 00:50:15,562
I didn't hit him.

962
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:18,180
Elmo, you knew she was headed

963
00:50:18,483 --> 00:50:19,776
for that poison oak, didn't you?

964
00:50:20,109 --> 00:50:21,109
Bad stuff.

965
00:50:21,402 --> 00:50:23,530
The lady would've been hurt bad.

966
00:50:23,863 --> 00:50:25,824
We all appreciate your concern, Elmo.

967
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:28,368
Some of us just didn't know
what you were trying to do.

968
00:50:28,701 --> 00:50:30,787
They thought maybe you
were trying to hurt Susie.

969
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:31,838
No, no, no.

970
00:50:32,038 --> 00:50:33,373
Elmo don't hurt no one.

971
00:50:33,706 --> 00:50:34,916
They know that now, Elmo.

972
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:36,876
So why don't you go on back to work

973
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,711
and we'll take care of things here.

974
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:42,465
In the future, try to
figure out what's going on

975
00:50:42,757 --> 00:50:44,843
before polarizing the
nearest good samaritan.

976
00:50:47,887 --> 00:50:49,514
I don't care what she says,

977
00:50:49,848 --> 00:50:51,367
I'm gonna keep an eye on that fruitcake.

978
00:50:51,391 --> 00:50:52,391
He's big.

979
00:50:53,977 --> 00:50:56,980
This is your idea of peace
and quiet for your sister?

980
00:50:57,981 --> 00:50:59,774
Come on, honey. It's been real exciting,

981
00:51:00,108 --> 00:51:02,277
but it's just about time
for your medicine now.

982
00:51:05,071 --> 00:51:08,157
(pulsing rock music)

983
00:52:24,984 --> 00:52:27,070
(duck squawks)

984
00:52:27,403 --> 00:52:30,198
(suspenseful music)

985
00:52:43,252 --> 00:52:46,422
(tense music)

986
00:52:58,226 --> 00:53:01,270
(eerie music)

987
00:53:12,156 --> 00:53:15,326
(tense music)

988
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:27,630
(tense music)

989
00:53:32,927 --> 00:53:36,139
(Susie screams)

990
00:53:36,472 --> 00:53:38,516
(Gina breathes heavily)

991
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:41,227
(tense music)
(Susie screams)

992
00:53:41,561 --> 00:53:42,979
(Gina breathes heavily)

993
00:53:43,312 --> 00:53:48,109
(tense music)
(Susie screams)

994
00:53:50,194 --> 00:53:52,613
(tense music)

995
00:53:53,614 --> 00:53:58,494
(Susie screams)
(tense music)

996
00:54:13,468 --> 00:54:18,306
(tense music)

997
00:54:30,651 --> 00:54:31,411
What was that?

998
00:54:31,611 --> 00:54:34,405
So we'll remain close
for the next 48 hours.

999
00:54:35,406 --> 00:54:36,741
After that, it's lost to us.

1000
00:54:40,411 --> 00:54:41,170
(Nancy exhales)

1001
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:43,372
What are you doing, Nancy?

1002
00:54:44,665 --> 00:54:46,793
I'm trying to commune with Susie's soul.

1003
00:54:47,126 --> 00:54:48,126
Her soul?

1004
00:54:51,422 --> 00:54:53,758
(eerie music)

1005
00:54:54,092 --> 00:54:56,236
You kids are lucky I lived
around here for a long time.

1006
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,137
I'd have never found this place.

1007
00:54:58,471 --> 00:55:02,558
Bandwagon is on the way, if
Doc Groova doesn't get lost.

1008
00:55:02,892 --> 00:55:03,976
Now, what's the story?

1009
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:05,812
She's right over there.

1010
00:55:06,854 --> 00:55:08,314
Jeff pulled her out of the water.

1011
00:55:08,648 --> 00:55:10,441
You found the body in the lake?

1012
00:55:10,775 --> 00:55:11,776
What's the victim's name?

1013
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:13,152
Susie Stryker.

1014
00:55:13,486 --> 00:55:14,646
She was a member of our band.

1015
00:55:14,862 --> 00:55:16,656
[Sheriff] I know, the Dead Girls.

1016
00:55:16,989 --> 00:55:19,075
Hey, a fan way out here.

1017
00:55:20,451 --> 00:55:21,571
I have a teenage daughter.

1018
00:55:21,702 --> 00:55:23,579
I burned her collection of your albums.

1019
00:55:27,166 --> 00:55:29,669
I don't understand
it, she was right here.

1020
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:32,421
Is this your idea of a joke?

1021
00:55:32,755 --> 00:55:34,715
I left her right here
wrapped in a blanket.

1022
00:55:35,049 --> 00:55:36,809
You could see something
heavy was lying here.

1023
00:55:37,009 --> 00:55:38,261
Something?

1024
00:55:38,594 --> 00:55:41,430
A sack of potatoes, maybe?
A couple kids making out,

1025
00:55:41,764 --> 00:55:43,764
a so-called prankster
rolling around on the ground,

1026
00:55:44,058 --> 00:55:45,852
but not a dead girl,

1027
00:55:46,185 --> 00:55:49,272
because dead girls don't
just get up and walk away.

1028
00:55:51,399 --> 00:55:53,067
Are you certain she was dead?

1029
00:55:53,401 --> 00:55:54,401
Sheriff, she was dead.

1030
00:55:54,694 --> 00:55:56,112
She was turning blue.

1031
00:55:56,445 --> 00:55:58,406
Does anybody here have a medical degree?

1032
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,534
Any medical training at all?

1033
00:56:01,868 --> 00:56:05,079
Nursing? Physical
therapy? Pharmaceuticals?

1034
00:56:06,539 --> 00:56:07,748
But you know she was dead

1035
00:56:08,082 --> 00:56:10,209
and you call me in immediately, right?

1036
00:56:10,543 --> 00:56:13,379
And now, maybe she's
dead, maybe she isn't,

1037
00:56:13,713 --> 00:56:15,464
but she's definitely missing, right?

1038
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,342
So I'm supposed to call out the troops

1039
00:56:18,676 --> 00:56:20,803
and launch a major search effort, correct?

1040
00:56:22,555 --> 00:56:24,515
I don't know what kind of
town you think this is,

1041
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:28,144
but our police force
consists of me and a deputy.

1042
00:56:29,228 --> 00:56:32,106
Our town paper is a four page biweekly

1043
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,066
and there's no local TV.

1044
00:56:35,276 --> 00:56:37,945
So what do you expect to get out of this?

1045
00:56:38,279 --> 00:56:40,781
Nothing you do up here is
gonna make the network news.

1046
00:56:41,115 --> 00:56:42,835
Even if some hotshot
reporter did happen by,

1047
00:56:43,159 --> 00:56:44,577
the only thing they'll find is me

1048
00:56:44,911 --> 00:56:48,164
filing this whole mess away
in our crank call folder.

1049
00:56:48,497 --> 00:56:51,751
You'll get no publicity at our expense.

1050
00:56:52,084 --> 00:56:54,795
Sheriff, this is not
a publicity gimmick.

1051
00:56:55,129 --> 00:56:58,382
Susie is dead and
someone's taken her body.

1052
00:56:58,716 --> 00:56:59,716
Who?

1053
00:56:59,759 --> 00:57:00,476
Why?

1054
00:57:00,676 --> 00:57:01,761
When?

1055
00:57:02,094 --> 00:57:03,095
Who had the opportunity?

1056
00:57:04,055 --> 00:57:07,058
And why on earth would
anybody want to hide this?

1057
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:08,476
What are you saying?

1058
00:57:08,809 --> 00:57:09,809
Look, we didn't exactly

1059
00:57:09,977 --> 00:57:11,771
keep tabs on each other, Dick Tracy.

1060
00:57:12,104 --> 00:57:14,106
We stayed in our rooms
'til we heard you pull up.

1061
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,901
Well, now you can go
back to your own rooms

1062
00:57:17,235 --> 00:57:18,653
and listen to me pull out.

1063
00:57:36,003 --> 00:57:38,631
Don't worry, honey,
it'll all be over soon.

1064
00:57:41,092 --> 00:57:44,845
Soon, they'll all be out
of your lives... forever.

1065
00:57:45,179 --> 00:57:46,973
Roger, Dorothy. Chance out.

1066
00:57:55,022 --> 00:57:56,816
You're lucky the doc
hadn't started out yet,

1067
00:57:57,149 --> 00:57:59,568
or I'd have charged his
expenses back to you.

1068
00:57:59,902 --> 00:58:03,155
I'd love to bust you right
now for raising a false alarm.

1069
00:58:03,489 --> 00:58:05,950
But the law said you
gotta do it more than once

1070
00:58:06,284 --> 00:58:07,702
for it to count as a violation.

1071
00:58:08,953 --> 00:58:11,414
Do it again, please.

1072
00:58:11,747 --> 00:58:13,874
Sheriff, something
is going on out there.

1073
00:58:14,208 --> 00:58:15,293
Then leave.

1074
00:58:16,377 --> 00:58:17,503
Even if that were true,

1075
00:58:17,837 --> 00:58:20,715
I couldn't have any patrols
out here with any regularity.

1076
00:58:21,048 --> 00:58:23,968
You wanted isolation, you got it.

1077
00:58:24,302 --> 00:58:26,387
Now, I'm going back to the office.

1078
00:58:26,721 --> 00:58:29,724
Don't let me see any of you
again or I'll put you in a cage.

1079
00:58:30,057 --> 00:58:31,392
Just what exactly did we do

1080
00:58:31,726 --> 00:58:33,394
to deserve such wrath, Sheriff?

1081
00:58:33,728 --> 00:58:35,808
I heard about those kids
in L.A. killing themselves

1082
00:58:35,938 --> 00:58:39,025
because of some secret messages
in the lyrics of your songs.

1083
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:42,445
I don't want your kind in my town.

1084
00:58:42,778 --> 00:58:44,739
Oh, so now we're guilty of intentionally

1085
00:58:45,072 --> 00:58:47,533
murdering those innocent children, right?

1086
00:58:47,867 --> 00:58:49,187
Couldn't have been a mistake, no.

1087
00:58:49,368 --> 00:58:51,537
Couldn't have been a
misunderstanding, you know.

1088
00:58:51,871 --> 00:58:55,124
No judge, no jury, no trial, just you.

1089
00:58:55,458 --> 00:58:57,293
That's right, just me.

1090
00:58:58,294 --> 00:59:01,213
Gee, sounds like what those
crackers down in Alabama

1091
00:59:01,547 --> 00:59:02,965
used to say about your people

1092
00:59:03,299 --> 00:59:06,135
when they were burning crosses
on their lawns in the '60s.

1093
00:59:07,595 --> 00:59:10,931
So much for the forces of law and order.

1094
00:59:11,265 --> 00:59:12,265
Now what do we do?

1095
00:59:12,975 --> 00:59:14,894
Maybe the sheriff was right.

1096
00:59:15,227 --> 00:59:16,354
Maybe Susie wasn't dead.

1097
00:59:16,687 --> 00:59:19,106
Maybe she woke up and wandered off.

1098
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,440
No way.

1099
00:59:21,108 --> 00:59:23,694
I pulled her outta the water
myself, she wasn't breathing.

1100
00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:25,029
She was cold.

1101
00:59:25,363 --> 00:59:25,997
Dead!

1102
00:59:26,197 --> 00:59:28,532
Oh, yeah? Well, what are
you all of a sudden, a doctor?

1103
00:59:28,866 --> 00:59:31,452
I mean, you didn't exactly
examine her or anything.

1104
00:59:31,786 --> 00:59:34,497
There could have been a faint
pulse, shallow breathing.

1105
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:37,750
I mean, she may have
spontaneously recuperated

1106
00:59:38,084 --> 00:59:39,210
and wandered off.

1107
00:59:39,543 --> 00:59:40,544
That could happen.

1108
00:59:40,878 --> 00:59:42,088
You know? Couldn't it, nursey?

1109
00:59:43,506 --> 00:59:44,506
It could.

1110
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:46,634
No, that wasn't it.

1111
00:59:47,802 --> 00:59:50,721
There was something going on
out there, something evil.

1112
00:59:51,931 --> 00:59:53,516
Susie didn't drown accidentally

1113
00:59:53,849 --> 00:59:55,889
and she didn't get up and
drag herself away, either,

1114
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,103
someone else did and...

1115
00:59:57,436 --> 00:59:59,581
Maybe it was that big friend
of yours in the overalls.

1116
00:59:59,605 --> 01:00:00,605
Could it be him?

1117
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:02,983
He certainly does seem to like us ladies.

1118
01:00:03,317 --> 01:00:07,029
No way. That guy is
big, but he's a pussycat.

1119
01:00:07,363 --> 01:00:09,907
I followed him yesterday
after he left Susie,

1120
01:00:10,241 --> 01:00:11,241
headed for the highway.

1121
01:00:11,534 --> 01:00:14,286
Last time I seen him, he was
thumbing a ride into town.

1122
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:16,163
Oh, well, gee, darn it.

1123
01:00:16,497 --> 01:00:17,641
I guess it must be some other

1124
01:00:17,665 --> 01:00:20,835
big, hulking, slobbering, psychopath.

1125
01:00:21,168 --> 01:00:24,296
God, I wonder what they do
in between insane rampages.

1126
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:26,382
I mean, do they stay at the motor lodge?

1127
01:00:26,715 --> 01:00:28,259
No, maybe they're all vegetarians.

1128
01:00:28,592 --> 01:00:30,237
Oh, no, wait, I know...
they're getting manicures.

1129
01:00:30,261 --> 01:00:31,261
Stop it now!

1130
01:00:31,512 --> 01:00:32,888
Susie is dead.

1131
01:00:33,222 --> 01:00:35,141
Your sister is alive in that room,

1132
01:00:35,474 --> 01:00:37,351
listening to every word you say.

1133
01:00:38,394 --> 01:00:41,772
She's not deaf and she's
not mentally incompetent.

1134
01:00:43,107 --> 01:00:45,401
She understands what you say.

1135
01:00:45,734 --> 01:00:47,611
She feels what you feel.

1136
01:00:49,238 --> 01:00:50,238
Your hatred.

1137
01:00:51,615 --> 01:00:52,700
Your fears.

1138
01:00:53,868 --> 01:00:55,536
Your jealousy.

1139
01:00:55,870 --> 01:00:59,540
And your useless,
worthless, bickering lives.

1140
01:01:02,918 --> 01:01:06,714
This so-called vacation was
supposed to help Brooke.

1141
01:01:07,047 --> 01:01:09,758
Instead, you're just hammering
nails into her coffin.

1142
01:01:11,093 --> 01:01:12,970
You know what Brooke really needs?

1143
01:01:13,304 --> 01:01:15,973
Brooke really needs a permanent
vacation from all of you.

1144
01:01:22,563 --> 01:01:25,107
We'll be driving into town
tomorrow for a checkup.

1145
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:27,443
We may stay overnight.

1146
01:01:29,278 --> 01:01:31,906
It's a long drive and
we'll need plenty of rest.

1147
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:33,282
Good day.

1148
01:01:33,616 --> 01:01:34,992
Bravo.

1149
01:01:35,326 --> 01:01:38,954
I guess Florence Nightingale
really put us in our place.

1150
01:01:39,288 --> 01:01:40,289
Maybe she's right.

1151
01:01:40,623 --> 01:01:41,707
Maybe.

1152
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:46,086
Or maybe we can put an end to
this whole farce right now.

1153
01:01:47,046 --> 01:01:48,714
Susie was dead.

1154
01:01:49,048 --> 01:01:52,092
As close as you can get
without actually crossing over.

1155
01:01:53,052 --> 01:01:54,220
Have you idiots forgotten

1156
01:01:54,553 --> 01:01:57,014
that she worked with
that magician for years?

1157
01:01:57,348 --> 01:01:58,348
He taught her everything.

1158
01:01:58,390 --> 01:02:00,310
How to hold her breath,
how to control her pulse,

1159
01:02:00,392 --> 01:02:01,392
the whole deal.

1160
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,355
She was just setting us up.

1161
01:02:04,688 --> 01:02:05,940
I don't get it.

1162
01:02:06,273 --> 01:02:08,651
Why would Susie wanna
do something like that?

1163
01:02:08,984 --> 01:02:10,236
Revenge.

1164
01:02:10,569 --> 01:02:12,613
Susie was history with this group.

1165
01:02:12,947 --> 01:02:14,382
Artie's been auditioning replacements

1166
01:02:14,406 --> 01:02:15,824
for the last two weeks.

1167
01:02:16,158 --> 01:02:18,369
I guess... she just
wanted to beat us to it.

1168
01:02:18,702 --> 01:02:20,142
I didn't know anything about that.

1169
01:02:20,454 --> 01:02:22,122
Well, you weren't supposed to.

1170
01:02:22,456 --> 01:02:24,458
Neither was she, but
she obviously found out

1171
01:02:24,792 --> 01:02:27,086
and tried to beat us to the punch.

1172
01:02:27,419 --> 01:02:29,463
Look, I promise you that
she's out there somewhere

1173
01:02:29,797 --> 01:02:32,258
laughing her off about this whole thing.

1174
01:02:32,591 --> 01:02:34,631
If she actually succeeds
in ruining our little trip,

1175
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,440
that's just gonna be
the icing on her cake.

1176
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,973
I don't get it, why
did Artie wanna fire her?

1177
01:02:39,306 --> 01:02:40,975
Why? Because she was a loady.

1178
01:02:41,308 --> 01:02:42,476
She was a tramp.

1179
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:44,895
She was a troublemaking
little bitch, that's why.

1180
01:02:45,229 --> 01:02:47,773
Look, just sit on this for a while.

1181
01:02:48,107 --> 01:02:50,067
I swear, as soon as she
sees that her little stunt

1182
01:02:50,359 --> 01:02:51,359
is it going to affect us,

1183
01:02:51,402 --> 01:02:52,945
she'll go running right back to Artie

1184
01:02:53,279 --> 01:02:54,799
with her tail tucked between her legs,

1185
01:02:54,989 --> 01:02:56,740
asking for a severance pay.

1186
01:02:57,074 --> 01:02:58,074
What's this?

1187
01:02:58,117 --> 01:02:59,761
It's the lyrics from
"Drowning Your Sorrows."

1188
01:02:59,785 --> 01:03:01,870
It's just like the other ones I found.

1189
01:03:02,204 --> 01:03:06,792
Oh, another part of this
Susie Stryker spook show.

1190
01:03:07,126 --> 01:03:09,128
She always was a bit melodramatic.

1191
01:03:09,461 --> 01:03:11,273
I don't know, maybe we
should call the sheriff.

1192
01:03:11,297 --> 01:03:12,548
He should know about this.

1193
01:03:12,881 --> 01:03:13,557
Sheriff?

1194
01:03:13,757 --> 01:03:16,385
You remember what he said
last time he was out here.

1195
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:18,530
Call him out here with
only that piece of paper

1196
01:03:18,554 --> 01:03:20,848
and he'll cheerfully haul
our butts to the pokey.

1197
01:03:21,849 --> 01:03:23,851
Look, everyone just relax.

1198
01:03:24,184 --> 01:03:25,894
And I'll patrol the grounds tonight, okay?

1199
01:03:26,228 --> 01:03:29,607
(suspenseful music)

1200
01:03:55,215 --> 01:03:58,302
(soft electric piano music)

1201
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:17,863
(suspenseful music)

1202
01:04:39,968 --> 01:04:42,638
Come on, we're gonna have a little talk.

1203
01:04:42,971 --> 01:04:45,933
(soft music cont.)

1204
01:04:57,945 --> 01:04:58,945
I'm sorry.

1205
01:04:59,113 --> 01:05:00,113
I'm sorry.

1206
01:05:00,406 --> 01:05:01,806
I'll make you think you're sorry.

1207
01:05:02,116 --> 01:05:03,784
You can't lay off the broads, can you?

1208
01:05:04,118 --> 01:05:05,345
Maybe you wanna do more than just look?

1209
01:05:05,369 --> 01:05:06,170
Maybe you wanna touch, huh?

1210
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:07,496
No, no, no.

1211
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:09,998
Miss Gina, I was worried about the man.

1212
01:05:10,332 --> 01:05:12,000
I didn't want the man to hurt her.

1213
01:05:12,334 --> 01:05:13,334
The man? What man?

1214
01:05:13,544 --> 01:05:14,178
What the hell are you talking about?

1215
01:05:14,378 --> 01:05:15,587
The man in the mask.

1216
01:05:15,921 --> 01:05:17,881
The ugly mask.

1217
01:05:18,215 --> 01:05:19,550
Miss Gina is so pretty.

1218
01:05:19,883 --> 01:05:21,301
The ugly mask?

1219
01:05:21,635 --> 01:05:23,971
You've been looking at
too many mirrors, pal.

1220
01:05:24,304 --> 01:05:26,140
Please, don't tell Miss Gina.

1221
01:05:26,473 --> 01:05:27,933
She would be mad with me.

1222
01:05:28,267 --> 01:05:29,977
Okay, I'll let this slip.

1223
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:32,230
But the next time I catch
you hanging around here

1224
01:05:32,563 --> 01:05:34,565
looking through windows
and watching people,

1225
01:05:34,898 --> 01:05:37,234
and I'll tell Miss Gina on you.

1226
01:05:37,568 --> 01:05:38,568
No, no.

1227
01:05:38,819 --> 01:05:40,362
Now, get outta here.

1228
01:05:46,618 --> 01:05:49,872
(Gina breathes heavily)

1229
01:05:51,081 --> 01:05:53,792
(door thuds)
(wind whistling)

1230
01:05:54,126 --> 01:05:57,504
(suspenseful music)

1231
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:16,190
(tense music)

1232
01:06:30,871 --> 01:06:33,373
(Gina screams)

1233
01:06:34,958 --> 01:06:37,795
(kettle whistling)

1234
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:47,638
You're up early.

1235
01:06:47,971 --> 01:06:49,807
Your breakfast is on the stove.

1236
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:50,816
I couldn't sleep.

1237
01:06:51,016 --> 01:06:52,184
Have you seen Jeff anywhere?

1238
01:06:54,311 --> 01:06:55,354
More nightmares.

1239
01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:58,010
This has been going on too long,

1240
01:06:58,232 --> 01:06:59,775
it's beginning to take its toll.

1241
01:07:00,818 --> 01:07:02,402
I can give you something.

1242
01:07:02,736 --> 01:07:03,946
No, that's okay.

1243
01:07:04,279 --> 01:07:07,407
What I need is to find
Jeff, maybe he's outside.

1244
01:07:07,741 --> 01:07:09,469
Remember, Brooke and I
will be off in a few minutes.

1245
01:07:09,493 --> 01:07:11,495
If you need us, the
number is on the fridge.

1246
01:07:13,872 --> 01:07:15,749
And remember, we're staying overnight.

1247
01:07:29,388 --> 01:07:30,388
Jeff?

1248
01:07:31,056 --> 01:07:32,056
Jeff?

1249
01:07:37,396 --> 01:07:38,916
I don't wanna hear about it anymore.

1250
01:07:39,189 --> 01:07:40,458
Your obsession with that little slut

1251
01:07:40,482 --> 01:07:42,234
is unnatural, disgusting.

1252
01:07:42,568 --> 01:07:44,278
So I just don't want to hear about it.

1253
01:07:46,655 --> 01:07:49,908
Look, I'm gonna go for a walk.

1254
01:07:50,242 --> 01:07:51,242
Get some fresh air.

1255
01:07:52,536 --> 01:07:53,536
Good morning.

1256
01:07:53,829 --> 01:07:55,330
Hi, have you seen Jeff anywhere?

1257
01:07:55,664 --> 01:07:56,664
No.

1258
01:08:01,086 --> 01:08:03,505
(tense music)

1259
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:25,068
What are you doing now?

1260
01:08:25,402 --> 01:08:26,402
Where did you find this?

1261
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:27,821
Few yards back.

1262
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:32,618
Something heavy has
been dragged along here.

1263
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:35,870
Not something.

1264
01:08:36,997 --> 01:08:37,997
Someone.

1265
01:08:40,959 --> 01:08:41,719
Barn.

1266
01:08:41,919 --> 01:08:45,297
(suspenseful music)

1267
01:09:08,946 --> 01:09:10,447
[Nancy] Gina, come here.

1268
01:09:10,781 --> 01:09:13,825
(tense music)

1269
01:09:22,209 --> 01:09:24,795
Oh my God, they're killing us.

1270
01:09:27,172 --> 01:09:29,716
We gotta get out of here.

1271
01:09:30,050 --> 01:09:30,851
The van!

1272
01:09:31,051 --> 01:09:32,511
They're taking the van!

1273
01:09:32,844 --> 01:09:36,223
(suspenseful music)

1274
01:09:37,182 --> 01:09:39,101
You sit right up here.

1275
01:09:51,989 --> 01:09:53,782
Okay, you ready to go, honey?

1276
01:09:55,033 --> 01:09:56,493
Do you need a hand or something?

1277
01:09:56,827 --> 01:09:57,827
No, we're fine.

1278
01:09:58,453 --> 01:10:00,914
Well, then, I guess we'll see you later.

1279
01:10:01,248 --> 01:10:02,499
Tomorrow morning.

1280
01:10:02,833 --> 01:10:03,977
You have a good old trip now, Brooksie.

1281
01:10:04,001 --> 01:10:07,254
You forget about us
monkeys for a while, okay?

1282
01:10:07,587 --> 01:10:10,465
We're off.

1283
01:10:10,799 --> 01:10:11,799
Stop!

1284
01:10:11,883 --> 01:10:15,971
Oh my God, wait!

1285
01:10:16,304 --> 01:10:17,304
Wait!

1286
01:10:18,849 --> 01:10:22,310
(dramatic music)

1287
01:10:24,062 --> 01:10:26,982
Whoa, tiger. What gives?

1288
01:10:27,315 --> 01:10:29,651
It's gone, I gotta call the sheriff.

1289
01:10:29,985 --> 01:10:31,236
Hold on, that friendly guy?

1290
01:10:31,570 --> 01:10:32,696
What gives here?

1291
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:34,364
The barn, they're all dead.

1292
01:10:34,698 --> 01:10:37,200
Susie, Jeff, covered in blood.

1293
01:10:37,534 --> 01:10:39,244
I gotta call the sheriff.

1294
01:10:39,578 --> 01:10:42,873
(tense music)

1295
01:10:44,166 --> 01:10:47,961
(Gina breathes heavily)

1296
01:10:48,295 --> 01:10:49,337
Shit!

1297
01:10:49,671 --> 01:10:52,966
(tense music)

1298
01:10:56,970 --> 01:11:00,265
Who did this?

1299
01:11:00,599 --> 01:11:01,599
I don't know.

1300
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:03,268
What are you doing?

1301
01:11:03,602 --> 01:11:06,897
Trip wire. With a potassium
nitrate-based explosive.

1302
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:08,231
Simple, but it'll work.

1303
01:11:08,565 --> 01:11:11,318
You really do know that
military shit, don't you?

1304
01:11:11,651 --> 01:11:13,445
If the enemy makes another kill,

1305
01:11:13,779 --> 01:11:16,114
his MO indicates that
he'll drag the body here.

1306
01:11:16,448 --> 01:11:17,888
And there are three avenues of entry

1307
01:11:18,075 --> 01:11:19,868
in this sector of the barn.

1308
01:11:20,202 --> 01:11:21,787
I've secured one.

1309
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:24,289
The other two are gonna take some time.

1310
01:11:24,623 --> 01:11:26,833
But I've got the goods and the materials.

1311
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:28,686
Now, we can expect dephysicalization...

1312
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:30,796
No! Stop right now!

1313
01:11:31,129 --> 01:11:32,209
Gina is calling the police.

1314
01:11:32,297 --> 01:11:36,218
They're gonna wanna see the
evidence and examine it.

1315
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:40,305
Unless you don't want the
police here for some reason.

1316
01:11:40,597 --> 01:11:43,141
The police aren't coming.

1317
01:11:44,643 --> 01:11:46,853
The phone is dead and the van is gone.

1318
01:11:47,187 --> 01:11:48,667
Look, we all know who's doing this.

1319
01:11:48,772 --> 01:11:49,898
It's one of us.

1320
01:11:50,232 --> 01:11:51,352
Dana, you don't mean that.

1321
01:11:51,525 --> 01:11:53,401
Figure it out, Nancy Drew.

1322
01:11:53,735 --> 01:11:54,735
Karen's dead.

1323
01:11:54,778 --> 01:11:55,579
Susie's dead.

1324
01:11:55,779 --> 01:11:56,413
Jeff's dead.

1325
01:11:56,613 --> 01:11:58,773
Your big friend, the gardener,
is outta town somewhere.

1326
01:11:58,949 --> 01:12:02,202
That only leaves you, me, Marky and her.

1327
01:12:02,536 --> 01:12:04,454
But whoever did this is crazy, insane.

1328
01:12:04,788 --> 01:12:07,207
Insane, a nut, a basket case.

1329
01:12:07,541 --> 01:12:09,751
We got plenty of those
around here, don't we?

1330
01:12:10,085 --> 01:12:12,337
She's mad as a hatter
and armed to the teeth.

1331
01:12:12,671 --> 01:12:14,089
Does she fill the bill?

1332
01:12:14,422 --> 01:12:16,967
And you, sweetie, with
your dreams, your letters,

1333
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:19,511
your "I don't wanna do
this anymore" attitude.

1334
01:12:19,845 --> 01:12:21,485
Maybe you wanna knock off the competition

1335
01:12:21,638 --> 01:12:22,678
and do it all by yourself.

1336
01:12:22,889 --> 01:12:24,641
If you believe that, then logic dictates

1337
01:12:24,975 --> 01:12:27,602
that we all remain together
until the van returns tomorrow.

1338
01:12:27,936 --> 01:12:28,936
Good idea.

1339
01:12:30,689 --> 01:12:32,732
We'll wait alone.

1340
01:12:34,025 --> 01:12:36,069
Marky and me, together, in our room.

1341
01:12:37,237 --> 01:12:40,615
Look, I don't know if
you're the one or you are.

1342
01:12:40,949 --> 01:12:42,492
Maybe you're in cahoots together.

1343
01:12:42,826 --> 01:12:44,595
Maybe you're just gonna
wait 'til I turn my back,

1344
01:12:44,619 --> 01:12:47,372
knock me off and it's
two to one against Marky.

1345
01:12:47,706 --> 01:12:50,417
Oh, no, I think we'll
take our chances alone.

1346
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:52,627
- Dana, don't.
- Don't touch me.

1347
01:12:52,961 --> 01:12:55,064
Don't you ever come near me
again or I'll kill you myself.

1348
01:12:55,088 --> 01:12:56,088
Do you understand?

1349
01:12:57,841 --> 01:13:00,343
Unless that one gets to you first.

1350
01:13:10,812 --> 01:13:12,230
What's wrong with the phone?

1351
01:13:13,231 --> 01:13:15,108
It's not the cord, you're sure of that?

1352
01:13:16,359 --> 01:13:18,111
I'm not sure of anything anymore.

1353
01:13:19,446 --> 01:13:21,907
It's all in one piece.

1354
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,367
I followed it until it
went into the wall there,

1355
01:13:24,701 --> 01:13:27,120
and then I went outside and
I couldn't find any wires.

1356
01:13:27,454 --> 01:13:30,415
Underground, unlikely to be disturbed.

1357
01:13:30,749 --> 01:13:32,393
God, if anybody's gonna
mess with the cord,

1358
01:13:32,417 --> 01:13:33,752
it would be in here.

1359
01:13:34,085 --> 01:13:34,761
What is it?

1360
01:13:34,961 --> 01:13:36,922
Oh, it's a J12 clip.

1361
01:13:37,255 --> 01:13:38,255
Somebody messed with it

1362
01:13:38,298 --> 01:13:40,217
and they reinserted it into the phone.

1363
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:41,611
Why would somebody do that?

1364
01:13:41,635 --> 01:13:43,386
I mean, just smash it
or pull the cord out.

1365
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,720
They would do it in that
way to disable the phone

1366
01:13:45,764 --> 01:13:48,099
without it appearing to be neutralized,

1367
01:13:48,433 --> 01:13:50,143
and it's also a lot harder to fix.

1368
01:13:50,477 --> 01:13:51,477
Can you fix it?

1369
01:13:51,603 --> 01:13:54,481
By jamming in just right,
we might make the connection.

1370
01:13:54,814 --> 01:13:56,014
And then we'll get a dial tone

1371
01:13:56,191 --> 01:13:59,444
and maybe a few seconds to
make a call, if we're lucky.

1372
01:13:59,778 --> 01:14:00,820
Did you get something?

1373
01:14:01,154 --> 01:14:01,788
Yeah.

1374
01:14:01,988 --> 01:14:03,156
Okay, make it quick.

1375
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:05,092
I don't know how long the
connection's gonna hold

1376
01:14:05,116 --> 01:14:06,743
and when it goes, it's fried,

1377
01:14:07,077 --> 01:14:08,757
and we won't be able to make another call.

1378
01:14:08,828 --> 01:14:10,372
You want me to make the call?

1379
01:14:10,705 --> 01:14:11,705
I don't know anyone.

1380
01:14:13,083 --> 01:14:14,268
The sheriff, I don't know his number.

1381
01:14:14,292 --> 01:14:16,052
We don't have any time
to call information.

1382
01:14:16,169 --> 01:14:18,046
Just call a number that you already know.

1383
01:14:26,972 --> 01:14:28,807
Come on, answer.

1384
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:30,140
Answer.

1385
01:14:31,017 --> 01:14:32,644
[Voicemail] Hi, this is Mike.

1386
01:14:32,978 --> 01:14:33,737
Mike, thank God.

1387
01:14:33,937 --> 01:14:35,206
[Voicemail] I'm not in right now,

1388
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:37,065
but leave a message at
the sound of the tone

1389
01:14:37,399 --> 01:14:39,479
and I'll get back to you
just as soon as I'm able to.

1390
01:14:40,485 --> 01:14:42,070
Mike, this is Gina.

1391
01:14:42,404 --> 01:14:45,532
We're in trouble up
here, Mike, we need help.

1392
01:14:45,865 --> 01:14:48,243
Someone is trying to kill us off.

1393
01:14:48,576 --> 01:14:51,371
We can't reach the sheriff,
or track him down or anything.

1394
01:14:51,705 --> 01:14:56,084
Jeff is dead, and Susie and Karen.

1395
01:14:56,418 --> 01:14:57,738
Oh, please, please, come up here.

1396
01:14:57,877 --> 01:14:58,877
We need you.

1397
01:15:02,215 --> 01:15:03,215
Dead.

1398
01:15:04,843 --> 01:15:06,428
I don't know how much got through.

1399
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,557
You better hope a lot.

1400
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:12,767
That's the last call on this machine.

1401
01:15:13,101 --> 01:15:14,894
I hope it was enough.

1402
01:15:15,228 --> 01:15:18,523
Maybe he'll come home and
hear it and understand it.

1403
01:15:22,152 --> 01:15:23,862
We're all gonna die here, aren't we?

1404
01:15:25,113 --> 01:15:27,198
Listen, don't be afraid.

1405
01:15:27,532 --> 01:15:29,367
Death is nothing to be frightened of.

1406
01:15:30,535 --> 01:15:33,079
It's a mystery that we all must explore.

1407
01:15:35,373 --> 01:15:38,043
But be angry, I mean, angry
that somebody could determine

1408
01:15:38,376 --> 01:15:40,337
the time and the manner in which you die.

1409
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:44,507
You can fight back.

1410
01:15:44,841 --> 01:15:46,009
Take my jacket.

1411
01:15:48,261 --> 01:15:49,679
Maybe it'll help you.

1412
01:15:50,013 --> 01:15:51,949
I used to wear it 'cause it
reminded me of the soldiers

1413
01:15:51,973 --> 01:15:53,133
who are so close to the void.

1414
01:15:53,433 --> 01:15:55,143
But that's why I wanted it.

1415
01:15:55,477 --> 01:15:58,438
But it'll keep you from the
void, that's why you want it.

1416
01:15:58,772 --> 01:15:59,573
Amy, I can't, it's yours.

1417
01:15:59,773 --> 01:16:00,940
You need it more than I do.

1418
01:16:01,274 --> 01:16:02,075
And there's some trinkets in here

1419
01:16:02,275 --> 01:16:05,445
that'll help you get through
the night in one piece.

1420
01:16:05,779 --> 01:16:07,280
And this is a big part of that.

1421
01:16:11,368 --> 01:16:13,244
Amy, I don't know how to use this.

1422
01:16:13,578 --> 01:16:15,413
Listen, you'll use it when you need to.

1423
01:16:16,831 --> 01:16:18,666
And these... I need.

1424
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,920
Gonna go back to the barn
and finish what I started.

1425
01:16:22,253 --> 01:16:22,971
Amy.

1426
01:16:23,171 --> 01:16:25,507
I mean, Nancy.
- Amy's fine.

1427
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,968
Listen, you stay here
and work on your karma.

1428
01:16:29,302 --> 01:16:30,678
It doesn't look good.

1429
01:16:31,012 --> 01:16:33,598
I'm gonna go work on something
a little bit more concrete.

1430
01:16:38,561 --> 01:16:41,648
(tense music)

1431
01:16:46,236 --> 01:16:48,988
Mark, come back.

1432
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:52,742
Don't do it, don't go out there.

1433
01:16:53,076 --> 01:16:54,076
Mark.

1434
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:57,997
(tense music)

1435
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,920
(suspenseful music)

1436
01:17:18,726 --> 01:17:20,854
Gina, I know who the killer is.

1437
01:17:22,355 --> 01:17:23,565
It's Mark!

1438
01:17:23,898 --> 01:17:26,860
(tense music)

1439
01:17:59,559 --> 01:18:02,729
(tense music)

1440
01:18:45,605 --> 01:18:49,025
(tense music)

1441
01:19:07,752 --> 01:19:10,922
(dramatic music)

1442
01:19:16,469 --> 01:19:19,639
(dramatic music)

1443
01:19:39,325 --> 01:19:42,745
(tense music)

1444
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:00,305
Before this moment,

1445
01:20:00,638 --> 01:20:03,224
I was never certain about the afterlife.

1446
01:20:03,558 --> 01:20:04,718
But now I know there's a hell

1447
01:20:04,934 --> 01:20:07,186
so bastards like you can burn forever.

1448
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,147
(tense music)

1449
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:11,941
(Nancy screams)

1450
01:20:35,715 --> 01:20:38,885
(dramatic music)

1451
01:20:40,887 --> 01:20:43,097
[Dana] I found this in his room.

1452
01:20:43,431 --> 01:20:44,431
Dana, this is weird.

1453
01:20:44,599 --> 01:20:46,319
But it doesn't prove
that he killed anybody.

1454
01:20:46,559 --> 01:20:47,360
Look at this!

1455
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:48,560
Look at this!

1456
01:20:49,604 --> 01:20:52,231
He's already marked off the
people that he's already done

1457
01:20:52,565 --> 01:20:54,734
and he knows how he's
gonna kill the rest of us.

1458
01:20:56,527 --> 01:20:58,446
And my name's on that list.

1459
01:20:58,780 --> 01:20:59,947
Me!

1460
01:21:00,281 --> 01:21:01,366
He wants to kill me!

1461
01:21:02,408 --> 01:21:03,785
Oh, Dana.

1462
01:21:04,118 --> 01:21:05,495
It's all right.

1463
01:21:05,828 --> 01:21:06,828
Where did he go just now?

1464
01:21:06,996 --> 01:21:08,932
I begged him not to go,
but he wouldn't listen to me.

1465
01:21:08,956 --> 01:21:10,208
He said we needed firewood.

1466
01:21:10,541 --> 01:21:11,342
The woods!

1467
01:21:11,542 --> 01:21:12,752
No, Amy's in the woods.

1468
01:21:13,086 --> 01:21:15,046
(tense music)

1469
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:17,757
Firewood as promised.

1470
01:21:18,091 --> 01:21:20,009
Well, I'll put it in the back.

1471
01:21:20,343 --> 01:21:23,054
Then you and I go back to the room.

1472
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:28,100
Find her.

1473
01:21:28,267 --> 01:21:29,519
Find Amy.

1474
01:21:29,852 --> 01:21:32,397
Wait 10 minutes, then come
back to the cabin to our room.

1475
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:34,190
He doesn't know we know.

1476
01:21:34,524 --> 01:21:36,684
If we take him by surprise,
maybe we can overpower him.

1477
01:21:36,734 --> 01:21:38,054
No, it's too dangerous for you.

1478
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:38,995
We don't know what he has in mind.

1479
01:21:39,195 --> 01:21:40,988
That's why we don't
have any time to wait.

1480
01:21:41,322 --> 01:21:41,956
Go.

1481
01:21:42,156 --> 01:21:43,156
Go.

1482
01:21:43,324 --> 01:21:46,369
(tense music)

1483
01:22:26,409 --> 01:22:28,995
(pensive music)

1484
01:22:36,627 --> 01:22:39,130
(Gina screams)

1485
01:22:45,178 --> 01:22:46,512
Bastard!

1486
01:22:46,846 --> 01:22:49,849
(tense music)

1487
01:22:54,896 --> 01:22:58,399
(suspenseful music)

1488
01:23:28,471 --> 01:23:29,471
Dana?

1489
01:23:29,639 --> 01:23:32,683
(suspenseful music)

1490
01:23:43,236 --> 01:23:44,236
Mark?

1491
01:23:45,196 --> 01:23:46,489
Dana?

1492
01:23:52,453 --> 01:23:53,212
Dana?

1493
01:23:53,412 --> 01:23:56,207
(suspenseful music)

1494
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:00,461
Oh, Dana.

1495
01:24:00,795 --> 01:24:02,797
(tense music)

1496
01:24:03,130 --> 01:24:04,173
He's out there.

1497
01:24:10,429 --> 01:24:11,848
[Mark] Hi, Gina.

1498
01:24:12,181 --> 01:24:13,181
Mark!

1499
01:24:13,724 --> 01:24:15,768
Nice to see you.

1500
01:24:16,102 --> 01:24:17,603
Sorry you have to go so soon.

1501
01:24:17,937 --> 01:24:20,064
(gun bangs)

1502
01:24:21,148 --> 01:24:25,194
You don't look so bad.
Here, have some more.

1503
01:24:27,864 --> 01:24:30,116
(gun bangs)

1504
01:24:31,659 --> 01:24:32,659
Dana.

1505
01:24:32,952 --> 01:24:36,080
(Gina breathes heavily)

1506
01:24:38,708 --> 01:24:40,209
Dana, I'm so sorry.

1507
01:24:42,461 --> 01:24:44,213
I'm so sorry, Dana.

1508
01:24:44,547 --> 01:24:46,632
But he would've killed us both.

1509
01:24:46,966 --> 01:24:49,552
He killed Amy, I found
her out in the woods.

1510
01:24:51,721 --> 01:24:52,972
I had to do it.

1511
01:24:53,306 --> 01:24:54,473
I had no choice.

1512
01:24:56,225 --> 01:24:57,351
I'm sorry, Dana.

1513
01:24:57,685 --> 01:24:58,685
(suspenseful music)

1514
01:24:58,936 --> 01:25:01,188
Not half as sorry as you're gonna be.

1515
01:25:01,522 --> 01:25:02,690
Let go of the gun, Gina.

1516
01:25:03,024 --> 01:25:04,066
What's happening?

1517
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,902
What's happening?

1518
01:25:06,235 --> 01:25:08,863
What's happening is you
just killed my brother.

1519
01:25:09,196 --> 01:25:10,239
But he was the killer.

1520
01:25:10,573 --> 01:25:12,533
He killed Amy and what he did to you...

1521
01:25:12,867 --> 01:25:13,951
What he did to me?

1522
01:25:14,285 --> 01:25:16,913
He never did anything but love me.

1523
01:25:18,664 --> 01:25:20,541
These bruises aren't real.

1524
01:25:20,875 --> 01:25:24,378
Remember, I am the one in
charge of makeup around here.

1525
01:25:25,463 --> 01:25:26,823
It was all just a part of the act.

1526
01:25:27,048 --> 01:25:28,048
Act? What act?

1527
01:25:28,257 --> 01:25:29,717
What for?

1528
01:25:30,051 --> 01:25:31,177
To kill you and Amy.

1529
01:25:32,845 --> 01:25:34,489
Both of you were supposed
to come back here.

1530
01:25:34,513 --> 01:25:35,806
Marky hides in the closet.

1531
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:37,308
I provide little diversion.

1532
01:25:38,351 --> 01:25:40,287
I didn't know which one of
you was knocking us off,

1533
01:25:40,311 --> 01:25:40,945
trying to take over the group.

1534
01:25:41,145 --> 01:25:42,229
I did not care.

1535
01:25:43,898 --> 01:25:45,098
We had to get the drop on Amy.

1536
01:25:45,316 --> 01:25:47,401
She's a walking military arsenal.

1537
01:25:47,735 --> 01:25:48,778
The plan would've worked,

1538
01:25:50,112 --> 01:25:52,823
but you killed Marky.

1539
01:25:53,908 --> 01:25:55,344
[Gina] The lyrics, the photographs.

1540
01:25:55,368 --> 01:25:56,369
Props!

1541
01:25:56,702 --> 01:25:57,702
Jeez.

1542
01:25:59,413 --> 01:26:00,623
It would've been perfect.

1543
01:26:01,916 --> 01:26:03,918
We would've gone back to town tomorrow,

1544
01:26:04,251 --> 01:26:06,128
told our story to the papers,

1545
01:26:06,462 --> 01:26:08,005
rode a wave of sympathy and love.

1546
01:26:08,339 --> 01:26:09,966
And the new edition of the Dead Girls,

1547
01:26:10,299 --> 01:26:12,009
starring Dana and Mark Grant,

1548
01:26:12,343 --> 01:26:13,487
would've been the biggest thing

1549
01:26:13,511 --> 01:26:15,513
to hit the recording industry.

1550
01:26:15,846 --> 01:26:16,931
It would've worked.

1551
01:26:18,516 --> 01:26:19,516
But you...

1552
01:26:21,102 --> 01:26:22,395
you ruined it all.

1553
01:26:23,312 --> 01:26:26,732
Dana, Amy wasn't the
killer and neither am I.

1554
01:26:27,066 --> 01:26:28,666
And if it wasn't us and it wasn't you...

1555
01:26:28,776 --> 01:26:29,776
You're lying!

1556
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:31,070
What?

1557
01:26:31,404 --> 01:26:32,404
What's the matter?

1558
01:26:32,446 --> 01:26:35,074
You two dykes have a falling
out amongst killers, huh?

1559
01:26:36,367 --> 01:26:39,578
No, this time, I'm gonna shoot
you right between the eyes

1560
01:26:39,912 --> 01:26:43,165
where that silly bitch's
fancy jacket can't help you.

1561
01:26:43,499 --> 01:26:46,544
(dramatic music)

1562
01:27:03,144 --> 01:27:06,022
(gun bangs)

1563
01:27:06,355 --> 01:27:09,900
(suspenseful music)

1564
01:27:13,779 --> 01:27:16,282
(Gina screams)

1565
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:22,121
(tense music)
(Gina screams)

1566
01:27:28,335 --> 01:27:31,505
(tense music)

1567
01:28:23,182 --> 01:28:26,352
(dramatic music)

1568
01:28:54,171 --> 01:28:57,424
(Gina breathes heavily)

1569
01:29:00,427 --> 01:29:03,013
(tense music)

1570
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:13,983
(suspenseful music)

1571
01:29:14,316 --> 01:29:16,569
Miss Gina, I saw that man
in the mask chasing you.

1572
01:29:16,902 --> 01:29:19,071
I had to save you to protect you.

1573
01:29:19,405 --> 01:29:20,781
Elmo, that man is dangerous.

1574
01:29:21,115 --> 01:29:22,115
We gotta get outta here.

1575
01:29:22,241 --> 01:29:23,241
Get us outta here.

1576
01:29:23,450 --> 01:29:24,618
I'll help you, Miss Gina.

1577
01:29:24,952 --> 01:29:27,246
We go where he can't go,
where you'll be safe.

1578
01:29:27,580 --> 01:29:29,500
Elmo, you know these
woods better than anybody.

1579
01:29:29,748 --> 01:29:30,875
Get us to a phone.

1580
01:29:32,501 --> 01:29:33,919
Get me to a phone!

1581
01:29:34,253 --> 01:29:35,253
No phone, Miss Gina.

1582
01:29:35,504 --> 01:29:38,382
I watched that man kill them all.

1583
01:29:38,716 --> 01:29:40,050
They deserved it.

1584
01:29:40,384 --> 01:29:41,594
Made fun of Elmo.

1585
01:29:41,927 --> 01:29:43,429
Kept you away from me.

1586
01:29:43,762 --> 01:29:45,514
(Gina screams)

1587
01:29:45,848 --> 01:29:48,726
Now they're all dead and
we'll be together for always.

1588
01:29:49,059 --> 01:29:50,895
We love each other, Miss Gina.
(Gina whimpers)

1589
01:29:51,228 --> 01:29:52,980
I'll straighten you out, Miss Gina.

1590
01:29:53,314 --> 01:29:55,774
This is how they straightened
me out at the institution.

1591
01:29:56,108 --> 01:29:56,867
(Gina screams)

1592
01:29:57,067 --> 01:29:58,485
They done a real good job.

1593
01:29:58,819 --> 01:30:00,821
They straightened Elmo out real good.

1594
01:30:05,993 --> 01:30:08,537
(dramatic music)

1595
01:30:08,871 --> 01:30:09,505
Get out of here, Elmo.

1596
01:30:09,705 --> 01:30:10,705
This isn't right.

1597
01:30:10,789 --> 01:30:13,834
(tense music)

1598
01:30:25,721 --> 01:30:27,056
You okay?

1599
01:30:27,389 --> 01:30:29,767
Mike, how did you find me?

1600
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:31,620
I heard your message
this morning on my machine.

1601
01:30:31,644 --> 01:30:33,145
I ran out here as soon as I could.

1602
01:30:34,939 --> 01:30:36,523
Do you know what's happened here?

1603
01:30:38,234 --> 01:30:39,610
They're all dead.

1604
01:30:39,944 --> 01:30:40,944
He killed them.

1605
01:30:41,153 --> 01:30:42,154
Everyone.

1606
01:30:42,488 --> 01:30:43,488
He put them in the barn.

1607
01:30:43,697 --> 01:30:45,282
Have you seen the barn?

1608
01:30:45,616 --> 01:30:49,828
When I first got here, I
found Mark and Dana. And Amy.

1609
01:30:50,913 --> 01:30:51,672
I went looking for you.

1610
01:30:51,872 --> 01:30:53,707
I knew you had to be somewhere alive.

1611
01:30:54,041 --> 01:30:56,001
I checked the barn and
then I heard you screaming,

1612
01:30:56,210 --> 01:30:57,610
I ran down here as fast as I could.

1613
01:30:57,711 --> 01:31:02,508
(Mike screams)
(tense music)

1614
01:31:07,972 --> 01:31:09,265
Mike! Stop!

1615
01:31:09,598 --> 01:31:14,395
Stop it, Mike.

1616
01:31:14,979 --> 01:31:15,979
Is he...?

1617
01:31:16,105 --> 01:31:17,105
Yeah.

1618
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:19,440
He's dead.

1619
01:31:22,987 --> 01:31:26,532
Elmo... I've known him ever
since I was a little kid.

1620
01:31:26,865 --> 01:31:29,368
I can't believe he'd do all those things.

1621
01:31:30,995 --> 01:31:31,995
He didn't.

1622
01:31:33,455 --> 01:31:34,455
I did.

1623
01:31:35,833 --> 01:31:38,502
(dramatic music)

1624
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:42,923
(suspenseful music)

1625
01:31:59,606 --> 01:32:03,277
(tense music)

1626
01:32:03,610 --> 01:32:04,987
This is the last of them.

1627
01:32:05,321 --> 01:32:07,364
I've cleaned up behind myself.

1628
01:32:07,698 --> 01:32:08,698
Like I always do.

1629
01:32:13,662 --> 01:32:15,205
You know what Reverend Saranko says,

1630
01:32:15,539 --> 01:32:18,167
"Cleanliness is next to godliness."

1631
01:32:19,168 --> 01:32:20,336
You were out a long time,

1632
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:24,423
but you've come back to us
at just the right moment.

1633
01:32:24,757 --> 01:32:26,508
(Gina whimpers)

1634
01:32:26,842 --> 01:32:29,887
(tense music)

1635
01:32:36,643 --> 01:32:39,104
I wanted you to know why did all this.

1636
01:32:39,438 --> 01:32:40,689
Nobody else would understand.

1637
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:44,234
You were one of us once.

1638
01:32:44,568 --> 01:32:48,906
You were brought up in
the way you ought to go.

1639
01:32:49,239 --> 01:32:51,784
Reverend Saranko, your
friends, your family,

1640
01:32:52,117 --> 01:32:53,827
yet you departed from it.

1641
01:32:54,161 --> 01:32:57,247
You were gonna marry me, remember?

1642
01:32:57,581 --> 01:33:01,293
The money and the drugs and
the sex make you forget, huh?

1643
01:33:07,383 --> 01:33:11,804
You walked away from us for that manager.

1644
01:33:12,137 --> 01:33:14,640
Yes, I took care of him, too.

1645
01:33:15,724 --> 01:33:17,142
You left us,

1646
01:33:17,476 --> 01:33:20,562
wrote those songs about
death and killing yourself.

1647
01:33:21,939 --> 01:33:25,234
You shouldn't do that.

1648
01:33:25,567 --> 01:33:28,070
I wanted you to know,
to see what was coming

1649
01:33:29,029 --> 01:33:30,406
and to understand why.

1650
01:33:33,951 --> 01:33:35,512
You know who told me
that you and your friends

1651
01:33:35,536 --> 01:33:37,162
deserve to die for what you had done?

1652
01:33:38,664 --> 01:33:39,664
God.

1653
01:33:40,499 --> 01:33:44,169
He speaks to me sometimes, in my head.

1654
01:33:44,503 --> 01:33:49,049
Not always, only when
it's really important.

1655
01:33:49,383 --> 01:33:50,383
And you know what?

1656
01:33:51,093 --> 01:33:53,303
He sounds just like Reverend Saranko.

1657
01:33:58,475 --> 01:33:59,768
He's talking to me now.

1658
01:34:02,938 --> 01:34:06,567
He wants you to die like the others.

1659
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:09,194
(Gina crying)

1660
01:34:10,195 --> 01:34:12,739
He wants me to do it, but I can't.

1661
01:34:13,949 --> 01:34:15,826
Forgive me Lord, I am a sinner.

1662
01:34:17,369 --> 01:34:18,579
I don't have the strength.

1663
01:34:20,831 --> 01:34:22,207
I'm just gonna leave you here.

1664
01:34:24,877 --> 01:34:26,336
You can take care.

1665
01:34:30,632 --> 01:34:31,632
Bye, Gina.

1666
01:34:34,178 --> 01:34:35,178
Hope you understand.

1667
01:34:37,264 --> 01:34:38,264
Forgive me.

1668
01:34:39,349 --> 01:34:44,271
(tense music)
(Mike convulsing)

1669
01:34:49,568 --> 01:34:50,568
Gina?

1670
01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:55,991
My gosh, what's happened to you?

1671
01:34:58,494 --> 01:34:59,494
Is this your barn?

1672
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:03,080
The cabins?

1673
01:35:06,251 --> 01:35:09,046
I remember you said you
were gonna go up there.

1674
01:35:09,379 --> 01:35:10,881
Is that where we are?

1675
01:35:13,967 --> 01:35:15,677
I can't remember anything

1676
01:35:16,011 --> 01:35:17,888
since the day you came home to see Brooke.

1677
01:35:20,265 --> 01:35:22,100
(Mike breathes heavily)

1678
01:35:22,434 --> 01:35:24,019
I have these blackouts, Gina.

1679
01:35:25,938 --> 01:35:28,774
I do bad things sometimes, I think.

1680
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:35,030
God, did I do that to you?

1681
01:35:36,198 --> 01:35:39,701
(suspenseful music)

1682
01:35:42,204 --> 01:35:43,204
No.

1683
01:35:44,915 --> 01:35:45,915
No.

1684
01:35:46,625 --> 01:35:48,794
(gentle suspenseful music)

1685
01:35:49,127 --> 01:35:50,712
These are your friends, aren't they?

1686
01:35:51,713 --> 01:35:54,258
From the van?
(Gina crying)

1687
01:35:54,591 --> 01:35:55,801
What have I done?

1688
01:35:58,262 --> 01:35:59,262
Oh, God.

1689
01:36:01,723 --> 01:36:02,723
Not again.

1690
01:36:03,016 --> 01:36:05,269
(Gina crying)

1691
01:36:08,230 --> 01:36:09,481
Did I kill them?

1692
01:36:12,192 --> 01:36:13,527
Kill them all?

1693
01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:16,697
(dramatic music)

1694
01:36:17,030 --> 01:36:18,782
I'm so sorry, Gina.

1695
01:36:19,116 --> 01:36:20,367
(Gina screams)

1696
01:36:20,701 --> 01:36:23,745
(dramatic music)

1697
01:36:25,122 --> 01:36:27,541
(Gina crying)

1698
01:36:41,305 --> 01:36:43,140
I don't know.

1699
01:36:43,473 --> 01:36:45,892
Looks like they did decide
to vacate the premises.

1700
01:36:47,978 --> 01:36:51,064
If they left, and we
drove all the way up here

1701
01:36:51,398 --> 01:36:53,609
and all they had to do was call,

1702
01:36:53,942 --> 01:36:55,444
I'm going to kill them.

1703
01:36:57,404 --> 01:37:00,991
Now, you stay here I'm
gonna go take a look around

1704
01:37:01,325 --> 01:37:03,118
and see if they took your stuff with them.

1705
01:37:17,966 --> 01:37:21,136
(tense music)

1706
01:37:37,694 --> 01:37:41,531
(Nurse screams)
(tense music)

1707
01:37:41,865 --> 01:37:44,159
You scared the life out of me.

1708
01:37:45,994 --> 01:37:47,704
I thought I told you to stay in the car.

1709
01:37:48,038 --> 01:37:49,706
I've been in the car all day.

1710
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:51,249
I wanted to get out.

1711
01:37:51,583 --> 01:37:52,583
I can help.

1712
01:37:53,377 --> 01:37:54,377
All right.

1713
01:37:54,670 --> 01:37:56,296
There's not much left, come on over.

1714
01:38:03,053 --> 01:38:04,304
Okay kid, that's it.

1715
01:38:05,681 --> 01:38:08,266
Can you think of anything
else before we go?

1716
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:10,352
'Cause we ain't coming back, honey pie.

1717
01:38:12,729 --> 01:38:14,147
Do you have to go?

1718
01:38:15,148 --> 01:38:16,566
All right, then off we go.

1719
01:38:18,151 --> 01:38:19,986
Wait, my necklace.

1720
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:23,657
Oh, that medallion. The barn.

1721
01:38:25,033 --> 01:38:26,743
I said I'd get that for you, didn't I?

1722
01:38:27,077 --> 01:38:28,077
You sure did.

1723
01:38:28,328 --> 01:38:29,129
All right.

1724
01:38:29,329 --> 01:38:30,889
All right, I'll go snoop around for it.

1725
01:38:31,206 --> 01:38:33,792
But this time, you stay right here.

1726
01:38:36,336 --> 01:38:37,921
Gina, are you all right?

1727
01:38:38,255 --> 01:38:40,716
(Gina whimpers)

1728
01:38:42,426 --> 01:38:44,344
This don't look too bad.

1729
01:38:44,678 --> 01:38:47,222
But if left untreated,
they could become infected.

1730
01:38:47,556 --> 01:38:50,600
(tense music)

1731
01:39:00,694 --> 01:39:02,821
You people really did it this time.

1732
01:39:04,448 --> 01:39:06,032
Like sharks in a feeding frenzy,

1733
01:39:06,366 --> 01:39:07,701
you just tore each other apart.

1734
01:39:10,454 --> 01:39:11,663
Look what you've done.

1735
01:39:11,997 --> 01:39:14,249
(tense music)

1736
01:39:21,047 --> 01:39:23,508
You force me to make a difficult decision.

1737
01:39:25,635 --> 01:39:27,053
The professional decision;

1738
01:39:28,472 --> 01:39:30,640
to release you, treat your wounds,

1739
01:39:31,683 --> 01:39:34,853
and allow you to continue to
pollute your sister's world.

1740
01:39:36,646 --> 01:39:41,193
Or... to give Brooksie a
final chance for recovery

1741
01:39:41,526 --> 01:39:43,278
by keeping you out of her life forever.

1742
01:39:47,157 --> 01:39:48,909
I'm sorry, Brooke Verelli is my patient

1743
01:39:49,242 --> 01:39:50,744
and my primary concern.

1744
01:39:51,077 --> 01:39:54,122
(tense music)

1745
01:40:01,713 --> 01:40:02,756
If it's any comfort,

1746
01:40:03,089 --> 01:40:07,344
you should be gone from exposure

1747
01:40:08,428 --> 01:40:11,890
in less than 48 hours.

1748
01:40:12,224 --> 01:40:14,392
I'm sure your sister will be just fine,

1749
01:40:14,726 --> 01:40:17,062
now that the Dead Girls
are out of her life.

1750
01:40:17,395 --> 01:40:18,605
(tense music)

1751
01:40:18,939 --> 01:40:20,524
(Gina whimpers)

1752
01:40:20,857 --> 01:40:21,491
Forever!

1753
01:40:21,691 --> 01:40:24,736
(tense music)

1754
01:40:30,826 --> 01:40:32,911
Here you go, kiddo.

1755
01:40:33,245 --> 01:40:34,621
Thank you.

1756
01:40:34,955 --> 01:40:36,435
I'm gonna be all right now, aren't I?

1757
01:40:36,665 --> 01:40:37,665
You sure are.

1758
01:40:38,416 --> 01:40:40,252
Starting right now.

1759
01:40:41,419 --> 01:40:44,422
(car engine revving)

1760
01:41:04,025 --> 01:41:07,195
(tense music)

1761
01:41:40,979 --> 01:41:44,316
(high energy rock music)
