Subtitle: Bogsee23 vs. Vercsike

2
00:00:30,016 --> 00:00:35,490
Once man and those
in the water were linked.

3
00:00:36,232 --> 00:00:40,361
They inspired us,
they spoke of the future.

4
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:44,913
Man listened and it became real.

5
00:00:46,017 --> 00:00:49,412
But man does not listen very well.

6
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,002
Man's need to own everything

7
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:56,048
led him deeper into land.

8
00:00:56,497 --> 00:00:59,505
The magic world of the ones
that live in the ocean

9
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:04,174
and the world of man
separated.

10
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:08,887
Through the centuries their world
and all the inhabitants of it

11
00:01:09,413 --> 00:01:11,073
stopped trying.

12
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:15,353
World of man
became more violent.

13
00:01:15,716 --> 00:01:18,143
War upon war played out

14
00:01:18,316 --> 00:01:20,784
as there were no guides
to listen to.

15
00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:27,009
Now…
Those in the water are trying again.

16
00:01:27,346 --> 00:01:29,152
Trying to reach us.

17
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:35,152
A handful of their precious young ones
have been sent into the world of man.

18
00:01:35,612 --> 00:01:38,233
They're brought in the dead of night

19
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,830
to where man lives.

20
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,068
They need only be glimpsed

21
00:01:44,797 --> 00:01:48,246
and the awakening of man will happen.

22
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:51,263
But their enemies roam the land.

23
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:55,582
There are laws that are
meant to keep the young ones safe

24
00:01:56,169 --> 00:01:59,931
but they are sent to
a great risk to their lives,

25
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:03,409
many do not return.

26
00:02:07,063 --> 00:02:08,801
Yet still they try,

27
00:02:09,535 --> 00:02:12,473
try to help man

28
00:02:13,897 --> 00:02:17,264
but man may have forgotten

29
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,148
how to listen…

30
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,620
My daughter says to be careful, Mr. Heep!

31
00:02:43,017 --> 00:02:47,464
Uuh... Well, it's some kind of a b.. bug.

32
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,155
It's very big!

33
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:52,899
It's very hairy!

34
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,381
…el es una criatura de el Diablo!

35
00:02:57,735 --> 00:03:01,788
My other daughter says it's
some kind of creature the Devil made.

36
00:03:02,707 --> 00:03:04,280
Tell her it's not a creature.

37
00:03:04,281 --> 00:03:06,881
There's no such thing
as creatures, all right?

38
00:03:08,364 --> 00:03:10,821
You might wanna turn away!

39
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:27,322
Sorry this is taking so long!

40
00:03:41,345 --> 00:03:43,570
It's over, It's over!

41
00:03:45,106 --> 00:03:46,417
It's safe.

42
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:57,215
My daughter says thank you
for protecting them.

43
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,945
Mr. Farber! I'm Cleveland Heep.
Welcome to The Cove!

44
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,267
Mr. Heep!

45
00:04:16,268 --> 00:04:17,996
Are you the new tenant?

46
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:20,908
Uh.. ya! This is Mr. Farber,
he is in 13B,

47
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,416
and Mr. Farber, this is Young-Soon Choi.

48
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:24,917
She lives with her mother at 8A.

49
00:04:25,172 --> 00:04:27,272
She is a student at the university.

50
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,959
Young-Soon,

51
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,960
you don't know
who has been swimming in the pool

52
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:34,861
the last few nights, do you?

53
00:04:35,062 --> 00:04:36,362
No, Mr. Heep.

54
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:40,495
Oh, by the way,
thanks, I liked it!

55
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,566
You're welcome!

56
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,932
Mr. Heep loves learning.

57
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,806
He doesn't want people to know.

58
00:04:47,945 --> 00:04:50,114
Mr Heep!
Pool man looking for you!

59
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:52,224
I tell him you come soon.

60
00:04:54,863 --> 00:04:57,206
Could you wait here
just a moment, please?

61
00:04:57,405 --> 00:04:59,058
Could I ask you something,
you answer me straight?

62
00:04:59,077 --> 00:05:00,352
Have you guys been
having parties in here?

63
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:03,371
Bubble parties, bubble bath,
everyone goes in skinny dipping?

64
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:04,372
No.

65
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,504
'Cause bubbles make the water very slick.

66
00:05:06,622 --> 00:05:07,911
No.

67
00:05:08,903 --> 00:05:10,146
I trust you on that.

68
00:05:11,418 --> 00:05:13,374
But something is making
this water like this.

69
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,375
There has been

70
00:05:14,876 --> 00:05:17,276
someone swimmimg at night time,

71
00:05:17,277 --> 00:05:21,077
I hear s.. splashing some nights.

72
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:26,078
When I left yesterday
afternoon this filter was empty.

73
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:38,358
You're kinda little flat, mate. You
could workout a little bit, right?

74
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,958
I can give you all vain like that,

75
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,111
I can make you look just like this.

76
00:05:44,112 --> 00:05:45,112
Right?

77
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:47,313
Those people say:

78
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:48,714
Hey, what's wrong with you Reggie,

79
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,215
why you only working out
on one side of your body?

80
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:53,716
Tell 'em it's like an experiment.

81
00:05:53,817 --> 00:05:55,617
I'm like a scientist.

82
00:06:01,391 --> 00:06:04,227
This morning
I measured my bicep.

83
00:06:06,378 --> 00:06:09,091
1,5 inches difference from
one side to the other.

84
00:06:11,684 --> 00:06:13,948
Take a guess at the
difference between my thighs.

85
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:14,949
Well, Reggie...

86
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,950
Hey!

87
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:16,951
Hey. It's all right.

88
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,552
Me and the new guy...

89
00:06:20,153 --> 00:06:21,853
we're talking science.

90
00:06:21,854 --> 00:06:22,854
OK, that's great!

91
00:06:22,855 --> 00:06:23,855
Here we go, Mr.

92
00:06:23,856 --> 00:06:25,156
Here we go! Come on.

93
00:06:28,084 --> 00:06:30,762
Don't hang out in the
stairway Reggie, please!

94
00:06:31,663 --> 00:06:32,763
-OK.
-All right.

95
00:06:35,902 --> 00:06:39,142
People might... trap.

96
00:06:39,143 --> 00:06:40,143
All right.

97
00:06:40,344 --> 00:06:41,544
Reggie is one of us.

98
00:06:41,445 --> 00:06:43,145
He just wants to be special.

99
00:06:43,146 --> 00:06:45,446
He is working out only
one side of his body.

100
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:48,147
Did he.. did he tell you that?

101
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:52,672
Hello Mr. Leeds.

102
00:07:00,062 --> 00:07:02,975
He's been here.. forever.

103
00:07:04,845 --> 00:07:07,983
Mrs. Bell,
she takes any animals.

104
00:07:08,084 --> 00:07:11,084
Smart lady.
You'd like her.

105
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:17,022
… a bunch of people better then he is.

106
00:07:17,852 --> 00:07:20,007
Name four people better then he is!

107
00:07:20,836 --> 00:07:23,988
...Lenny, Axel Rose,
Brett Michael is better than he is,
John Bon Jovi …

108
00:07:29,757 --> 00:07:30,999
This is you.

109
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:38,291
Theres no smoking inside,

110
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:43,143
and theres no swimming after seven.

111
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,760
I hope It's OK to ask.

112
00:07:50,227 --> 00:07:52,465
What brings you out here from
the west coast, Mr. Farber?

113
00:07:52,816 --> 00:07:55,550
I've been hired to be the local film and
book critics at the paper.

114
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,217
Did they flew you all
the way out here from there?

115
00:07:57,952 --> 00:07:58,904
They did.

116
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:01,095
Oh you must be very... God!

117
00:08:20,739 --> 00:08:22,634
Mr. Heep, Mary Pen again.

118
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:26,656
I smell something awful coming
form the upstairs appartment.

119
00:08:26,988 --> 00:08:29,074
I think someone may have died,

120
00:08:29,287 --> 00:08:32,225
and the body is decomposing.

121
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:34,754
I know I said this last week but…

122
00:10:30,147 --> 00:10:30,987
Wow, I saw you!

123
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,932
I saw you!

124
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:41,461
Come out of that pool right now!

125
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:44,464
Hey!

126
00:10:48,197 --> 00:10:49,410
I'm gonna wait!

127
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,753
Hey!

128
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:00,674
Hey!

129
00:11:05,184 --> 00:11:06,805
Come on out now! This...

130
00:11:09,776 --> 00:11:11,261
It's not safe!

131
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,406
Come on out!
This is not...

132
00:11:17,307 --> 00:11:19,207
This is not funny!

133
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,224
Please stop!

134
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:05,939
Is this you pull me out?

135
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,400
Where are you from?

136
00:13:16,235 --> 00:13:17,458
Blue World.

137
00:13:18,691 --> 00:13:20,034
Is that an apartment?

138
00:13:21,976 --> 00:13:23,381
Do you feel an awakening?

139
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,178
I'm sorry?

140
00:13:27,297 --> 00:13:31,530
You feel like pins and needles inside?

141
00:13:37,314 --> 00:13:38,586
It is not you.

142
00:13:46,186 --> 00:13:48,010
It's late.

143
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:53,994
You really... shouldn't be here.

144
00:13:56,723 --> 00:13:58,211
Im kinda old fashioned that way.

145
00:13:58,425 --> 00:13:59,901
I don't even know your name.

146
00:14:00,171 --> 00:14:01,594
My name is Story.

147
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,253
I didn't mean for you to tell.

148
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,408
Why am I not stuttering?

149
00:14:12,174 --> 00:14:13,324
What?

150
00:14:19,513 --> 00:14:21,213
All right Story, my name is Cleveland.

151
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,911
From the cliffs.

152
00:14:25,235 --> 00:14:26,751
That's what your name means.

153
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:29,611
From where do you know that?

154
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,286
From my studies.

155
00:14:33,965 --> 00:14:37,588
I promise that I will not
get you into trouble.

156
00:14:37,858 --> 00:14:38,909
You can go.

157
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:42,256
I am scared.

158
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,422
I will wait here with you Cleveland.

159
00:14:48,815 --> 00:14:50,509
Why are you scared?

160
00:15:03,556 --> 00:15:04,955
You can wait here,

161
00:15:05,298 --> 00:15:08,899
for a little bit,
until you feel not so scared.

162
00:15:13,883 --> 00:15:15,146
Are you OK?

163
00:15:22,895 --> 00:15:24,660
Oh my God! It's just a kid.

164
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:46,675
Hello!

165
00:15:58,743 --> 00:15:59,852
It's time to go,

166
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:01,167
Story.

167
00:16:12,254 --> 00:16:14,028
OK, I think you need some fresh air.

168
00:16:15,661 --> 00:16:17,045
I'm just gonna take you outside,

169
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,008
and I'm gonna put you one of the poochairs,

170
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,086
then I'll get you some coffe,

171
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:23,987
then you can wake up,

172
00:16:26,227 --> 00:16:27,545
then I'll walk you home.

173
00:16:36,513 --> 00:16:38,848
Tell me who the world are you anyway?

174
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:42,264
Narf.

175
00:16:42,917 --> 00:16:43,928
What?

176
00:16:50,182 --> 00:16:51,296
Ok.

177
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:52,606
Come on.

178
00:16:52,722 --> 00:16:54,081
Here we go.

179
00:18:23,485 --> 00:18:25,873
... sort of hairy,

180
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:28,249
but matter like clumps.

181
00:18:28,961 --> 00:18:32,907
You know... and it was kind of green.

182
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,106
Was it green?

183
00:18:34,795 --> 00:18:36,794
Ya, I thought so.

184
00:18:37,527 --> 00:18:39,031
Matter is not right,

185
00:18:39,648 --> 00:18:41,702
it was flat and

186
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:43,170
thicker than hair,

187
00:18:45,846 --> 00:18:47,018
like this, like this!

188
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,202
Flat and this kind of a color.

189
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:53,498
Is this not helping you at all?

190
00:18:53,951 --> 00:18:55,061
Forget about its hair for a second.

191
00:18:55,105 --> 00:18:56,552
It's obviously some dumb animal who

192
00:18:56,653 --> 00:18:58,153
muddied himself.

193
00:18:58,211 --> 00:18:59,511
No!

194
00:18:59,657 --> 00:19:00,647
Was it a Great Dane?

195
00:19:00,648 --> 00:19:01,648
No, no, no Sir.

196
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:06,049
Are there wolves in this area, hyenas?

197
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:09,050
Hey Jack, this is Philadelphia,
where do you think you're living?

198
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,351
Sorry, something keeps
setting up the sprinklers.

199
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:18,352
I'm look around the forest
and check behind the dumpsters and stuff

200
00:19:18,353 --> 00:19:20,953
An animal the size that you're describing,

201
00:19:20,554 --> 00:19:22,554
doesn't just walk around 'n not be seen.

202
00:19:22,555 --> 00:19:24,755
There's nowhere for a
dumb big animal to hide.

203
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:39,016
Hey.

204
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,342
Got a lot of homework, right?

205
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:43,991
University gave us many pages of reading.

206
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:45,864
What they think, I have no social life?

207
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,551
I got more books for you.

208
00:20:50,156 --> 00:20:53,023
Could you look up the word NARF for me?

209
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,815
It's an eastern bedtime story, Mr. Heep.

210
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,743
I do not remember it, my great

211
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:05,744
grandmother used to tell it
when she was alive.

212
00:21:07,456 --> 00:21:08,882
Bedtime story?

213
00:21:09,921 --> 00:21:11,001
What's the story?

214
00:21:12,674 --> 00:21:14,136
I don't know remember.

215
00:21:16,952 --> 00:21:19,184
How about your mother?

216
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:33,458
Hello, Mrs. Choi, hello.

217
00:21:40,071 --> 00:21:41,944
She wants to know
who told you this word.

218
00:21:42,443 --> 00:21:47,018
Oh just a friend...
I don't know her very well.

219
00:21:50,911 --> 00:21:53,257
She said that her grandmother

220
00:21:53,681 --> 00:21:56,051
used to tell this story

221
00:21:56,464 --> 00:21:58,945
like a prayer, like it was true.

222
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:04,102
She said she knew someone,
who knew someone,

223
00:22:04,941 --> 00:22:05,691
who saw one.

224
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:07,863
Saw one what?

225
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:13,429
A Narf.

226
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,350
The bedtime story says is a sea nimph.

227
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:23,494
What happens in the story, please?

228
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:44,467
In the bedtime story,

229
00:22:45,653 --> 00:22:48,533
she must be seen by the one
human chosen for her.

230
00:22:55,396 --> 00:22:58,460
This person is called the Versol.

231
00:22:59,014 --> 00:23:02,982
Seeing the Narf awaken
something important.

232
00:23:04,944 --> 00:23:07,474
If she is successful in this,

233
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:13,524
she will return with
the Great Eatlon, a giant eagle,

234
00:23:14,324 --> 00:23:16,326
and become free.

235
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:19,668
She won't tell me more.

236
00:23:20,387 --> 00:23:22,836
She said why can't I be
like my older sister

237
00:23:22,837 --> 00:23:24,337
she married a dentist.

238
00:23:39,104 --> 00:23:40,035
Story!

239
00:23:42,576 --> 00:23:43,478
Story!

240
00:23:47,356 --> 00:23:48,677
Cleaveland!

241
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:57,324
Story, could you
put something back on?

242
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:14,031
Are you here to meet someone
or see someone in this building?

243
00:24:18,547 --> 00:24:21,064
Is somebody supposed to see you?

244
00:24:26,203 --> 00:24:29,503
This...

245
00:24:37,285 --> 00:24:39,010
It is a writer.

246
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,530
Do you know his name?

247
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,349
Do you know what it looks like?

248
00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:01,690
Dou you know if it's a woman or a man?

249
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:10,037
Is this something that
you wanna tell me?

250
00:25:16,773 --> 00:25:20,793
Is this person writing
something important?

251
00:25:28,264 --> 00:25:29,577
When do you have to leave?

252
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:31,520
I can leave tonight

253
00:25:32,023 --> 00:25:33,469
if I meet this person.

254
00:25:34,297 --> 00:25:35,889
I wanna help you to get home.

255
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,943
Thank you Cleveland!

256
00:25:44,383 --> 00:25:45,839
I have to go.

257
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:57,950
Hello, I.. I wanted to ask you
something about your work...

258
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,514
... your critic work.

259
00:26:00,801 --> 00:26:04,512
How.. How's it going?

260
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,729
I'm seeing a romance film tonight.

261
00:26:07,381 --> 00:26:08,845
Not my cup of tee.

262
00:26:09,046 --> 00:26:11,246
So you.. you haven't
written anything yet?

263
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:13,827
No, I haven't written
anything for some time.

264
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,624
You were right about that one tenant.

265
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:18,725
I spoke with Mrs. Bell,

266
00:26:19,326 --> 00:26:20,526
we got along.

267
00:26:20,827 --> 00:26:22,427
She's very good with animals.

268
00:26:24,444 --> 00:26:26,347
You know she wrote a book?

269
00:26:28,228 --> 00:26:31,173
Mr. Heep I will be taking the cat in direct.

270
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:33,756
Don't worry Mrs. Bell.

271
00:26:36,523 --> 00:26:38,428
Oh.. look at you.

272
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,660
There's a lot of butterflies
around this building.

273
00:26:45,431 --> 00:26:47,252
Strange behavior for them.

274
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:49,067
They are not usually so trusty.

275
00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:55,284
I understand that you're a writer Mrs. Bell.

276
00:26:56,674 --> 00:26:58,574
Now where do you hear such things?

277
00:26:59,575 --> 00:27:04,128
Maybe I read your book.

278
00:27:05,146 --> 00:27:09,104
That'd be quite a trick, it's been
out of stock for twenty years.

279
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,406
Twenty years?

280
00:27:10,747 --> 00:27:12,713
So haven't written anything recently?

281
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:15,856
Mr. Farber has been speaking out of term.

282
00:27:19,813 --> 00:27:21,875
Look at this cereal caracter's picture, Dad.

283
00:27:21,876 --> 00:27:23,276
It looks just like aunt Sophie's eyes

284
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:26,635
when she found that everybody
hated her fruit board painting.

285
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,271
Nine-letter word for inhuman form.

286
00:27:33,163 --> 00:27:34,685
You'll figure out, Dad.

287
00:27:37,805 --> 00:27:41,681
You know the color on this box is
just like the colors of your car dad.

288
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:44,632
Maybe we should take your car
and go visit aunt Sylvia.

289
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:48,081
Incarnets.

290
00:27:49,182 --> 00:27:52,582
Well, you're very good with those
word puzzles, Mr. Dury?

291
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,072
U-huh, he's at grand master level.

292
00:27:55,686 --> 00:27:57,122
I'm gonna be just like him.

293
00:27:57,391 --> 00:27:58,613
So you like words a lot, huh?

294
00:27:58,614 --> 00:27:59,814
I adore them.

295
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:03,226
Are you...
are you writing anything, Mr. Dury?

296
00:28:03,427 --> 00:28:05,127
A book, maybe?

297
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:10,866
No, I'm affraid my skills are
limited to cross-word puzzles.

298
00:28:13,522 --> 00:28:14,760
There's some serious weakage man.

299
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:17,722
You don't even speak English anymore.

300
00:28:18,552 --> 00:28:19,795
What? Weakage?

301
00:28:19,957 --> 00:28:21,678
Damn straight it's English:
the state of weak.

302
00:28:22,342 --> 00:28:24,227
There's no weakage man!

303
00:28:25,064 --> 00:28:27,066
Some smoker just like us made it up

304
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:28,667
somewhere here you are speak it.

305
00:28:29,952 --> 00:28:32,705
Let's make up a winning phrase!

306
00:28:32,997 --> 00:28:34,330
And it will become famous.

307
00:28:34,993 --> 00:28:36,754
Needs to be on some T-shirt

308
00:28:36,755 --> 00:28:38,155
or something, you ass.

309
00:28:38,156 --> 00:28:39,456
No, it doesn't!

310
00:28:39,657 --> 00:28:40,857
It just catches up,

311
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:42,158
people just start saying it.

312
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,830
Blim-blam.

313
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:46,851
What?

314
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,222
Plim-plam?

315
00:28:48,397 --> 00:28:49,744
Somebody already said that.

316
00:28:52,215 --> 00:28:55,531
Gentlemen... I.. uh

317
00:28:55,632 --> 00:29:02,232
I don't suppose that you have written
anything lately?

318
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:06,433
An essay or something?

319
00:29:06,934 --> 00:29:09,434
Something important?

320
00:29:10,547 --> 00:29:12,514
No essays here, my man.

321
00:29:14,578 --> 00:29:19,140
Ok. Stop putting your clothes
in the garbage disposal,

322
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,287
and stop smoking!

323
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,074
Baby's on the half tip!

324
00:29:35,493 --> 00:29:36,809
There you go!

325
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:38,960
Mr. Heep!

326
00:29:38,961 --> 00:29:40,361
She told me a little bit more of the story

327
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:41,962
before she threw a coushion at me.

328
00:29:41,963 --> 00:29:43,163
Young-Soon!

329
00:29:43,664 --> 00:29:46,464
You're not writing anything, are you?

330
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,174
P..Paper maybe?

331
00:29:51,474 --> 00:29:53,638
Writing?
No, Mr. Heep!

332
00:29:53,639 --> 00:29:56,439
This semester all multiple choice courses.

333
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,540
Young-Soon is not stupid.

334
00:30:00,628 --> 00:30:02,958
She told me about a bad guy in the story.

335
00:30:04,183 --> 00:30:06,918
These creatures are called Scrunts.

336
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,919
They're ment to kill a Narf
when she's out of the water.

337
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:14,182
They can lay completley flat.

338
00:30:14,733 --> 00:30:16,766
Their back is covered in grass.

339
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:20,424
My great grandmother said
that's why man never sees them.

340
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:24,152
They appeal as a bump in the thorns.

341
00:31:15,151 --> 00:31:16,224
Vick, Anna!

342
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:19,458
Mr. Heep the lighter on my
desk is still not working.

343
00:31:20,243 --> 00:31:22,045
I promise I'll get to it.

344
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,946
How is the writing?

345
00:31:24,047 --> 00:31:25,347
Slow.

346
00:31:25,448 --> 00:31:26,748
Are you tired Mr. Heep?

347
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:31,700
How long have you been writing that?

348
00:31:32,954 --> 00:31:34,010
Six months.

349
00:31:36,073 --> 00:31:36,887
What?

350
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:38,410
I should finish, right?

351
00:31:38,411 --> 00:31:40,411
He just... it just sits on his desk.

352
00:31:40,412 --> 00:31:41,712
My brother's scared.

353
00:31:41,713 --> 00:31:42,813
He'll do anything to get out of writing.

354
00:31:42,814 --> 00:31:43,814
See this?

355
00:31:43,815 --> 00:31:45,015
It's the third load of loundry

356
00:31:45,016 --> 00:31:46,316
he has done this week.

357
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:50,978
I can fix that light now, if you want.

358
00:32:35,064 --> 00:32:36,202
A cook book.

359
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,984
This is kind of...

360
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:46,543
silly.

361
00:32:50,892 --> 00:32:52,371
That's not how you fold.

362
00:32:52,372 --> 00:32:53,772
Mr. Heep tell her to stop annoying me.

363
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:55,173
I fixed the light.

364
00:32:55,174 --> 00:32:56,774
I'll make you dinner Mr. Heep.
Thank you!

365
00:32:57,828 --> 00:32:58,864
You both cooks?

366
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,896
Who? Him?

367
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,658
He can't cook.
He is banned from the kitchen.

368
00:33:10,258 --> 00:33:13,120
I don't understand something.
I'm sorry. My ladder...

369
00:33:15,236 --> 00:33:17,896
I accidentally bumped into your desk,

370
00:33:17,897 --> 00:33:20,097
I ended up seeing the title of

371
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,498
what it is you writing

372
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,099
is not a cook book?

373
00:33:24,055 --> 00:33:25,511
I know it's a bad title, all right?

374
00:33:26,585 --> 00:33:30,856
It's actually ... it's just my thoughts
and all the cultural problems and

375
00:33:31,744 --> 00:33:33,551
thoughts on leaders and stuff.

376
00:33:34,227 --> 00:33:36,473
I dont know who's gonna want
publish that thing.

377
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,254
That is not how you fold.

378
00:33:52,596 --> 00:33:54,917
Your thoughts are very sad.

379
00:33:58,777 --> 00:34:00,738
Most are of one night.

380
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:06,182
A night a man entered your home
and you were not there.

381
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:11,957
He stole many things and
killed your wife and children.

382
00:34:13,706 --> 00:34:16,066
That is when you stopped being happy.

383
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,214
You were a doctor!

384
00:34:24,364 --> 00:34:26,614
I am very sorry for you.

385
00:34:28,202 --> 00:34:30,981
You believe you have no purpose.

386
00:34:31,846 --> 00:34:33,760
You help all that live here.

387
00:34:34,466 --> 00:34:36,577
Anybody could do this job, Story.

388
00:34:37,414 --> 00:34:38,677
You have a purpose.

389
00:34:40,482 --> 00:34:42,655
All beings have a purpose.

390
00:34:49,348 --> 00:34:51,003
I know who you are.

391
00:34:52,912 --> 00:34:55,898
And I think that I found your Versol.

392
00:34:56,722 --> 00:34:58,692
You know what I'm talking about, right?

393
00:35:02,482 --> 00:35:04,987
He's outside.
Do you need to see him alone,

394
00:35:04,988 --> 00:35:06,988
or does he just need to see you?

395
00:35:17,613 --> 00:35:19,151
Cover yourself up.

396
00:35:24,173 --> 00:35:25,221
Hey!

397
00:35:25,319 --> 00:35:27,619
Mr. Heep I know I signed that format.

398
00:35:28,658 --> 00:35:30,156
I gave it to you on the stairs.

399
00:35:30,157 --> 00:35:31,157
Ok.

400
00:35:32,026 --> 00:35:33,230
My sister is all angry at me now.

401
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,731
Well, I check again.

402
00:35:36,596 --> 00:35:38,333
By the way, this is my friend, Story.

403
00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:43,926
Hi!

404
00:35:59,797 --> 00:36:01,463
Yeah, you were right, here it is!

405
00:36:03,488 --> 00:36:04,777
Great!

406
00:36:08,405 --> 00:36:09,425
You all right?

407
00:36:09,426 --> 00:36:10,426
You look a little...

408
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:16,292
I'm feeling fine, it's nothing.

409
00:36:18,351 --> 00:36:20,554
Is it pins and needles kind of feeling?

410
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:24,574
Yeah, kind of.

411
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:28,377
Yeah!

412
00:36:30,514 --> 00:36:32,126
Maybe you should go lie down.

413
00:36:38,684 --> 00:36:39,645
Nice meeting you.

414
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:43,614
I'm so very happy we saw each other.

415
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:09,050
You don't have to leave
right now, do you?

416
00:37:11,174 --> 00:37:13,706
I'll have to finish a couple
of things, and I'll be back.

417
00:37:14,656 --> 00:37:15,793
Is that Ok?

418
00:37:16,615 --> 00:37:18,561
Your words are very beautiful.

419
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,752
Your heart is very big.

420
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:37,055
Noone knows about my family here.

421
00:37:39,474 --> 00:37:44,074
Please, do not bring it up again!

422
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:56,652
Comin'!

423
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:00,731
Sorry I'm late Mrs. Bobchuck,

424
00:38:02,315 --> 00:38:03,340
it's been a long day.

425
00:38:03,564 --> 00:38:04,710
Come on.

426
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,254
Listen, he's out on the toilett.

427
00:38:09,402 --> 00:38:11,606
He's been having some gas issues.

428
00:38:11,713 --> 00:38:13,101
Don't tell him I told you.

429
00:38:13,102 --> 00:38:14,102
I thought the toilett was broken,

430
00:38:14,103 --> 00:38:15,303
that's why I came.

431
00:38:15,604 --> 00:38:17,404
He may just be looking at the mirror.

432
00:38:18,457 --> 00:38:20,881
He's got this growth on his ass.

433
00:38:20,946 --> 00:38:22,498
Don't tell him I told you.

434
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,107
Honey!

435
00:38:26,357 --> 00:38:27,320
Cleveland's here.

436
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:28,864
He's come to fix the toilett.

437
00:38:28,937 --> 00:38:30,302
Tell him I fixed already.

438
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:31,719
I called the plumber this morning.

439
00:38:32,046 --> 00:38:33,342
Don't let it hurt his feelings.

440
00:38:33,695 --> 00:38:34,632
Right.

441
00:38:36,476 --> 00:38:37,857
That's.. That's Ok.

442
00:38:38,909 --> 00:38:40,103
I should come when you call.

443
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:41,440
It's my job.

444
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:45,133
What if that things out there

445
00:38:45,378 --> 00:38:46,572
will try to catch you?

446
00:38:47,601 --> 00:38:48,585
There are laws.

447
00:38:48,921 --> 00:38:50,000
It will be safe.

448
00:38:50,426 --> 00:38:52,068
I'm allowed to leave this night.

449
00:39:02,247 --> 00:39:04,394
-How long do you think?
-It is time.

450
00:39:04,736 --> 00:39:06,102
You must not watch.

451
00:39:06,331 --> 00:39:08,088
Am I not allowed to wacht you leave?

452
00:39:09,425 --> 00:39:10,667
I won't watch.

453
00:39:10,968 --> 00:39:13,268
Thank you for letting me
wear your beautiful shirt.

454
00:39:14,495 --> 00:39:15,256
Keep it.

455
00:40:47,591 --> 00:40:48,729
What happened?

456
00:40:50,731 --> 00:40:51,705
Ok.

457
00:40:52,258 --> 00:40:53,208
Ok.

458
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:55,977
Hey, calm down!

459
00:40:55,978 --> 00:40:57,478
Calm down!

460
00:40:58,167 --> 00:40:59,693
How did you get those scratches?

461
00:41:01,642 --> 00:41:02,716
Did the eagle come?

462
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,467
Did something go wrong?
Story!

463
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,576
Story!

464
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,191
Was it that dog again?

465
00:41:19,901 --> 00:41:21,761
I thought it was gonna be safe!

466
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,945
Your face doesn't look right. Are you Ok?

467
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,909
Mr. Heep. is here, he has a friend.

468
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,632
She is beautiful!

469
00:41:46,025 --> 00:41:47,874
She's not feeling that well,

470
00:41:48,242 --> 00:41:49,932
so she is laying down in my room.

471
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,233
Why is she here?

472
00:41:51,234 --> 00:41:52,234
Why isn't she in his place?

473
00:41:52,835 --> 00:41:54,435
Oh, she got sick in
the stairway downstairs.

474
00:41:57,154 --> 00:42:01,010
She is wearing no clothes under his shirt.

475
00:42:01,544 --> 00:42:02,645
Blim-blam.

476
00:42:04,544 --> 00:42:06,995
Mr. Heep is a player.

477
00:42:15,114 --> 00:42:16,321
I hope it's all right.

478
00:42:16,746 --> 00:42:17,704
It's fine.

479
00:42:18,262 --> 00:42:19,750
Do we need to take her to the hospital?

480
00:42:19,751 --> 00:42:21,151
No, no no no. That's...

481
00:42:21,152 --> 00:42:22,352
Fine?

482
00:42:23,153 --> 00:42:24,353
Thank you.

483
00:42:26,508 --> 00:42:28,042
No, she just needs some rest.

484
00:42:28,516 --> 00:42:30,273
She can stay as long as she needs to.

485
00:42:32,169 --> 00:42:33,628
You started writing again?

486
00:42:36,628 --> 00:42:37,638
Yeah.

487
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,256
I'll be right back, Ok?

488
00:42:49,254 --> 00:42:50,253
Hello!

489
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:52,390
Mrs. Choi,

490
00:42:52,552 --> 00:42:54,351
is Young-Soon at home?

491
00:42:54,352 --> 00:42:55,452
No home!

492
00:42:55,453 --> 00:42:56,653
No? All right!

493
00:42:56,654 --> 00:42:57,854
Unbelivable!

494
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:06,682
Hey, hey!

495
00:43:09,474 --> 00:43:10,431
Thanks!

496
00:43:11,928 --> 00:43:14,415
- Yeah, hallo!
- Mr. Heep?

497
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:16,516
- Where are you?
- At a club!

498
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,722
Don't tell my mother!
She thinks I'm at a dance class.

499
00:43:20,401 --> 00:43:20,938
Ok!

500
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:24,994
What happens if a Narf gets scratched?

501
00:43:25,129 --> 00:43:27,674
I don't know,
put my mother on I'll ask her!

502
00:43:29,981 --> 00:43:31,950
- Oma, Oma!
- This is yours Mrs. Choi.

503
00:43:47,686 --> 00:43:49,246
- Hey!
- Thank you!

504
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:53,959
She.. she doesn't look happy.

505
00:43:54,182 --> 00:43:57,254
She said the story her grandmother told

506
00:43:56,996 --> 00:43:59,404
said, the Scrunt has a poison to kill a Narf,

507
00:43:59,405 --> 00:44:03,405
but, she said Narf can protect themselves.

508
00:44:04,673 --> 00:44:07,626
They have given a Marcode key
that cures them.

509
00:44:07,718 --> 00:44:10,034
They keep it where they live.

510
00:44:11,388 --> 00:44:13,537
Ok, Ok, all right.

511
00:44:14,439 --> 00:44:19,253
You said that the eagle
comes to take them back.

512
00:44:19,254 --> 00:44:20,254
U-huh.

513
00:44:20,255 --> 00:44:21,355
Right.

514
00:44:21,356 --> 00:44:24,456
Now, what stops this green thing
from attacking them,

515
00:44:24,457 --> 00:44:26,057
when the eagle comes.

516
00:44:27,733 --> 00:44:31,541
You're funny Mr. Heep!
You've really thought about this!

517
00:44:31,883 --> 00:44:33,242
Put my Mom on!

518
00:44:56,082 --> 00:44:57,806
- Hey!
- Yeah! Thanks!

519
00:44:58,999 --> 00:45:00,035
Yes?

520
00:45:00,227 --> 00:45:03,390
She said only a Rog Scrunt
will break the law of that night

521
00:45:03,391 --> 00:45:05,391
because most Scrunts are afraid.

522
00:45:05,428 --> 00:45:07,037
Afraid of what?

523
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:08,138
Thatuthic!

524
00:45:08,214 --> 00:45:11,437
They are the law keepers
in this bedtime story.

525
00:45:12,162 --> 00:45:15,374
Her grandmother said,
there are three of them,

526
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:18,575
but they are called one name: Thatuthic.

527
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:23,007
They live in the trees they are said
to look like monkeys.

528
00:45:23,431 --> 00:45:27,026
Noone knows for sure because
noone who has seen them

529
00:45:27,027 --> 00:45:28,127
has lived!

530
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:32,454
The legend said that
they were born so evil

531
00:45:32,983 --> 00:45:35,768
that they killed their parents
on the night they were born.

532
00:45:36,868 --> 00:45:41,343
The fear of them has kept justice
in the Blue World for centuries.

533
00:45:42,207 --> 00:45:43,694
By Mr. Heep!

534
00:45:50,496 --> 00:45:51,505
Thanks!

535
00:46:09,587 --> 00:46:12,395
They have given a Marcod key
that cures them.

536
00:46:13,535 --> 00:46:15,360
They keep it where they live.

537
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,869
My Mom figured out that I was at a club.

538
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,070
She made me come home.

539
00:49:18,437 --> 00:49:20,342
She tell me more of the story.

540
00:49:20,489 --> 00:49:21,731
Why are you wet?

541
00:49:22,586 --> 00:49:24,021
A.. Apartment business.

542
00:49:25,347 --> 00:49:26,362
Listen Mr. Heep!

543
00:49:27,366 --> 00:49:29,678
My mother things that you're a stranger.

544
00:49:29,904 --> 00:49:31,751
You have to make her see you as a child.

545
00:49:31,752 --> 00:49:33,052
Innocent!

546
00:49:33,605 --> 00:49:35,839
Then she will tell you the bedtime story.

547
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:39,110
There is a reason
the rules might be broken.

548
00:49:40,453 --> 00:49:43,114
A Dousen Narf is about a rare Narf

549
00:49:43,538 --> 00:49:45,995
who comes once in a
generation of a Narfs

550
00:49:46,037 --> 00:49:48,143
who is called the Madam Narf.

551
00:49:48,844 --> 00:49:51,944
Her Versol is important.
This Versol will cause change.

552
00:49:51,945 --> 00:49:56,545
But it is the Madam Narf herself
that is truly the key.

553
00:49:57,846 --> 00:50:00,146
She's considered a queen to her people.

554
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:05,351
Her return will be seen
as a great inspiration.

555
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:08,842
A Scrunt will do anything
to kill a Madam Narf.

556
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,786
Even forget his fears of a Thatuthic.

557
00:50:12,128 --> 00:50:14,733
He might break the rules
for that, Mr. Heep.

558
00:50:16,089 --> 00:50:18,765
She know, that she is a Madam Narf?

559
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:22,224
No! That is moral of a bedtime story.

560
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:25,032
Noone is ever told who they are!

561
00:50:26,195 --> 00:50:27,563
I think we are linked.

562
00:50:28,395 --> 00:50:30,778
It's more than just a story to me too.

563
00:50:31,177 --> 00:50:33,074
I actually want to believe it.

564
00:50:34,751 --> 00:50:36,053
Good bye, Mr. Heep!

565
00:50:52,714 --> 00:50:54,644
You saved my life again.

566
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:58,653
Have you made that room?

567
00:51:01,716 --> 00:51:03,460
The cracks that I saw

568
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:05,461
is that room supposed to
collapse eventually?

569
00:51:06,288 --> 00:51:08,712
I'm not allowed to speak
of the Blue World.

570
00:51:09,597 --> 00:51:11,719
That door needs a little work.

571
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:18,311
I noticed that you took things
from the apartment

572
00:51:18,312 --> 00:51:20,212
that people left around the pool.

573
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:24,249
That's how I saw you.

574
00:51:24,737 --> 00:51:26,563
You were taking something
off of a chair.

575
00:51:33,974 --> 00:51:37,617
I think I might know why
the Scrunt needs to get you so bad.

576
00:51:37,791 --> 00:51:39,739
Why did he break the rules tonight?

577
00:51:41,091 --> 00:51:43,975
If it turns out...
I think that you're someone

578
00:51:45,147 --> 00:51:47,349
very important to everyone.

579
00:52:27,841 --> 00:52:30,501
I tried to tell him about you
I don't know if I did the right thing.

580
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,849
I'm not sure how's he gonna react.

581
00:52:35,056 --> 00:52:39,261
I trust you.
I believe you are here to protect me.

582
00:52:44,137 --> 00:52:45,699
Is the key working?

583
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:47,956
Yes, thank you.

584
00:52:49,289 --> 00:52:52,216
If it is true, that I am...

585
00:52:51,851 --> 00:52:53,980
He'll keep coming after me.

586
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,696
I'll not be in safe until...

587
00:52:58,018 --> 00:52:59,861
Until Thatuthic comes.

588
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:17,151
My mother said she saw
a ghost once in the basement.

589
00:53:17,523 --> 00:53:19,199
I was the only one who believed her.

590
00:53:19,911 --> 00:53:21,796
She'n not an apparition, Anna.

591
00:53:24,053 --> 00:53:25,966
I don't know who you are,

592
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:29,708
but you did something to me.

593
00:53:32,429 --> 00:53:34,020
My thoughts...

594
00:53:38,689 --> 00:53:40,383
Everything became clear.

595
00:53:42,462 --> 00:53:45,742
The fears that were modelling
my thoughts just went away.

596
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:48,988
I can hear myself.

597
00:53:51,537 --> 00:53:53,641
Do you wish to know your future?

598
00:54:00,325 --> 00:54:04,167
A boy, in the mid-west of this land
will grow up in a home

599
00:54:04,168 --> 00:54:07,168
where your book will be on the
shelf and spoken of often.

600
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:10,396
He'll grow up with his ideas in his head.

601
00:54:11,984 --> 00:54:14,188
He will grow into a great orator.

602
00:54:14,937 --> 00:54:17,914
He will speak and his words
will be heard throughout this land

603
00:54:18,015 --> 00:54:21,015
and throghout the world.

604
00:54:21,878 --> 00:54:25,320
This boy will become
the leader of this country,

605
00:54:26,209 --> 00:54:28,588
and begin a movement of great change.

606
00:54:29,913 --> 00:54:32,189
He will speak of you and your words.

607
00:54:33,653 --> 00:54:36,397
Your book will be the seeds of many
of his great thoughts.

608
00:54:39,805 --> 00:54:41,596
It will be the seeds of change.

609
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,567
The cook-book?

610
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:48,568
Uno, dos, tres...

611
00:55:42,325 --> 00:55:45,810
Could you tell her that
I was interested in hearing

612
00:55:45,811 --> 00:55:46,811
more of the story.

613
00:56:20,224 --> 00:56:22,454
Tell her it's a beautiful story.

614
00:56:25,198 --> 00:56:27,239
Are there any parts that
might be good to hear?

615
00:56:50,978 --> 00:56:52,319
How is she?

616
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,520
The medicin's helping her.

617
00:56:53,521 --> 00:56:54,921
I told her to stay under the shower

618
00:56:54,922 --> 00:56:56,422
she does much better with water.

619
00:56:56,423 --> 00:56:57,523
I need to talk with her.

620
00:56:57,524 --> 00:56:59,024
In fact you'd be there too.

621
00:57:01,361 --> 00:57:04,731
I told them to wait right outside
I'll tell them what you have to say.

622
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:10,052
Tell her I know that she's
not allowed to tell about her world

623
00:57:10,075 --> 00:57:12,697
but maybe I could ask some
questions and she could just say

624
00:57:12,698 --> 00:57:13,998
If it's right or wrong.

625
00:57:14,774 --> 00:57:17,383
You know what I did when I was a
little girl and me and my girlfriends

626
00:57:17,384 --> 00:57:18,984
would get in big trouble?

627
00:57:18,985 --> 00:57:20,985
My Mom always wanted
to know what happened

628
00:57:20,986 --> 00:57:23,186
but I was like: I can't tell on my friends.

629
00:57:23,187 --> 00:57:25,187
So. She came up with this way

630
00:57:25,188 --> 00:57:27,788
of me telling her things without talking.

631
00:57:27,789 --> 00:57:29,789
She would say: touch your ear

632
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:32,290
point something if the answer is yes.

633
00:57:32,791 --> 00:57:35,491
So I would, and then she would
know certain things

634
00:57:35,492 --> 00:57:37,792
but I didn't really feel like
I told on my friends.

635
00:57:38,883 --> 00:57:40,815
It was cheating I know but

636
00:57:40,816 --> 00:57:42,416
made me feel better.

637
00:57:43,736 --> 00:57:44,921
We are ready!

638
00:57:48,179 --> 00:57:50,385
So, in this bedtime story

639
00:57:51,192 --> 00:57:54,259
a Narf has come to a
pretty ordained place

640
00:57:55,122 --> 00:57:57,352
she must leave from the same spot.

641
00:57:58,376 --> 00:58:00,896
This eagle, the Great Eathlon
coming to take her back

642
00:58:00,897 --> 00:58:02,697
is really very important,

643
00:58:02,698 --> 00:58:04,298
and here is the good stuff.

644
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,799
There are humans with powers

645
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,600
that can help her.

646
00:58:08,895 --> 00:58:11,607
And these people have been
unconciously drawn

647
00:58:11,608 --> 00:58:13,608
to live near the Versol.

648
00:58:14,386 --> 00:58:16,726
These humans don't know who they are

649
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:19,896
and they always appear
in the story earlier.

650
00:58:19,897 --> 00:58:22,997
Are there humans with powers
that can help you

651
00:58:22,998 --> 00:58:24,898
but don't know who they are?

652
00:58:26,446 --> 00:58:27,853
That's a Yes!

653
00:58:29,592 --> 00:58:32,010
They got weird names: a Symbolist,

654
00:58:32,011 --> 00:58:33,811
a Guardian, and the Guild.

655
00:58:33,812 --> 00:58:35,412
Ask her if that's right!

656
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,165
You want something.

657
00:58:41,588 --> 00:58:42,714
One of them.

658
00:58:43,397 --> 00:58:44,468
Vick!

659
00:58:44,983 --> 00:58:46,107
Mr. Heep!

660
00:58:47,025 --> 00:58:48,380
Mr. Heep is one of them.

661
00:58:50,037 --> 00:58:51,590
Which one?

662
00:58:51,591 --> 00:58:53,091
Guild, Guardian?

663
00:58:55,447 --> 00:58:57,867
She thinks Mr. Heep is the Guardian!

664
00:58:59,642 --> 00:59:02,520
I was told that there's a Symbolist,

665
00:59:02,521 --> 00:59:04,821
an interpreter who can read
signs in clouds

666
00:59:04,822 --> 00:59:06,122
and other forms.

667
00:59:06,123 --> 00:59:07,123
He will interpret messages...

668
00:59:09,247 --> 00:59:12,323
...from the Universe,
if problem should arise.

669
00:59:12,324 --> 00:59:13,924
Do you know who the Symbolist

670
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,625
or interpreter is?

671
00:59:15,626 --> 00:59:17,226
That's a No.

672
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,260
And I was told that there is a Guild

673
00:59:22,261 --> 00:59:24,861
whose many hands will combine to help.

674
00:59:24,862 --> 00:59:26,862
Does she know who they are?

675
00:59:27,157 --> 00:59:29,607
There is a Guild or something,

676
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:31,808
they're supposed to help
with their hands.

677
00:59:33,464 --> 00:59:34,802
That's another No.

678
00:59:36,925 --> 00:59:39,481
All right. There's one other.
I don't know if it's worth mentioning

679
00:59:39,482 --> 00:59:41,282
it's not in the stories all the time.

680
00:59:42,427 --> 00:59:44,983
It's a human, usually a female.

681
00:59:46,281 --> 00:59:51,010
So full of hope that they
can awaken the life force

682
00:59:51,011 --> 00:59:52,411
and other things.

683
00:59:52,412 --> 00:59:54,012
Now that one's called the Healer.

684
00:59:55,369 --> 00:59:59,514
You can't tell that they're in the story,
because butterflies are drawn to the Healer.

685
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:07,003
Last one's a Healer... You don't know
any of these people, do you?

686
01:00:13,454 --> 01:00:14,730
Reading?

687
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:16,415
A book?

688
01:00:17,181 --> 01:00:18,404
Learning?

689
01:00:20,558 --> 01:00:22,052
She thinks it has to be a word.

690
01:00:23,051 --> 01:00:25,108
Is the eagle going to come back for her?

691
01:00:28,419 --> 01:00:29,963
Only one last time.

692
01:00:30,684 --> 01:00:33,704
Mr. Heep you know the people in this
building, you have to find them!

693
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:42,738
What is it?

694
01:00:43,601 --> 01:00:45,368
You know these walls are paper thin?

695
01:00:46,001 --> 01:00:48,892
I can hear all the bloody noise
downstairs like they're in my kitchen.

696
01:00:49,509 --> 01:00:50,979
Can you do anything about that?

697
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:55,101
Of course not.

698
01:00:56,114 --> 01:00:57,335
What is it you want anyway?

699
01:00:57,336 --> 01:00:58,736
I had a question.

700
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:03,618
You're an expert of plots, right?

701
01:01:03,919 --> 01:01:05,919
You know who's gonna do what

702
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,520
in a book or a movie even
at the beginning, yes?

703
01:01:09,121 --> 01:01:11,921
There is no originality left
in the world Mr. Heep.

704
01:01:13,243 --> 01:01:15,586
That is a sad fact I've come to live with.

705
01:01:15,587 --> 01:01:18,787
If there was a mystery

706
01:01:18,788 --> 01:01:20,988
and a guy had to figure out

707
01:01:20,989 --> 01:01:23,189
who some people were

708
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:25,890
he had to find a symbol guy

709
01:01:27,118 --> 01:01:28,766
someone can figure out messages.

710
01:01:30,456 --> 01:01:35,645
and a Guild of people who are going
to be important at the end as a group.

711
01:01:37,164 --> 01:01:39,178
How would you figure that out?

712
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:42,258
The symbol person should be simple.

713
01:01:43,937 --> 01:01:47,226
Look for any character who
was doing something mundane,

714
01:01:47,227 --> 01:01:49,227
but required analysis.

715
01:01:49,548 --> 01:01:51,974
Someone who was skilled at puzzles.

716
01:01:52,525 --> 01:01:55,220
Joey, you can't have cereals for lunch.

717
01:01:54,821 --> 01:01:57,821
This picture on cereal box
is supposed to make you feel happy.

718
01:01:59,322 --> 01:02:02,322
But I feel sad like that time
you forgot to pick me up at school.

719
01:02:04,166 --> 01:02:08,838
Joey, Mr. Heep appears disquieted
can you give us a moment alone?

720
01:02:10,001 --> 01:02:11,208
Sure, Dad.

721
01:02:13,977 --> 01:02:14,938
As for the Guild?

722
01:02:15,568 --> 01:02:18,429
Look for any group of characters
that are always seen together

723
01:02:18,593 --> 01:02:23,993
and have seemingly irrelevant and tedious
dialogue that seems to regurgitate forever.

724
01:02:23,794 --> 01:02:26,794
...and you just sit around
and talk about nothing?

725
01:02:27,295 --> 01:02:29,495
Oh.. we talk about serious issues.

726
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:31,896
On occassion.

727
01:02:36,035 --> 01:02:39,343
We talked about Martin Luther King,
in the Tequila Hut on Tuesday night.

728
01:02:42,392 --> 01:02:43,695
You talked about him?

729
01:02:43,696 --> 01:02:44,996
This is the writers way

730
01:02:44,997 --> 01:02:47,697
of establishing characters
who would be important

731
01:02:47,698 --> 01:02:49,498
further in the story.

732
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:50,899
Is there anything further

733
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,100
I can assist you with
during my nap time?

734
01:02:53,101 --> 01:02:55,501
No, no Mr. Farber, thank you!

735
01:03:12,642 --> 01:03:14,698
Story, these young men are the Guild.

736
01:03:16,201 --> 01:03:19,025
And Mr. Dury... Mr. Dury?

737
01:03:19,626 --> 01:03:21,826
Mr. Dury is the interpreter.

738
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:25,450
And there's one other person Mrs. Bell,

739
01:03:25,451 --> 01:03:27,251
could you come in here please?

740
01:03:28,786 --> 01:03:29,951
This is Mrs. Bell.

741
01:03:31,077 --> 01:03:32,173
The Healer.

742
01:03:33,985 --> 01:03:36,311
Story wants to go home, and she can't.

743
01:03:37,161 --> 01:03:39,012
Tomorrow night is her last chance.

744
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:42,844
Mr. Dury please step forward.

745
01:03:43,251 --> 01:03:45,106
Mr. Heep, you're not stuttering!

746
01:03:45,107 --> 01:03:46,907
I know, I know, it's only around her!

747
01:03:50,009 --> 01:03:53,290
Now, the interpreter will tell us what to
do if something should go wrong.

748
01:03:53,891 --> 01:03:57,291
He'll use an instrument specific to him

749
01:03:58,092 --> 01:03:59,692
to interpret.

750
01:04:01,563 --> 01:04:03,398
Try it Mr. Dury!

751
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:06,042
Let's just see what happens!

752
01:04:07,224 --> 01:04:09,266
I think that there's a
message in there for us.

753
01:04:14,672 --> 01:04:16,829
Nine-letters across...

754
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:18,430
it's the word essential

755
01:04:19,031 --> 01:04:20,431
and ...

756
01:04:21,032 --> 01:04:23,032
and it touches...

757
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:26,727
twenty-seven down

758
01:04:27,404 --> 01:04:29,483
which is scheme.

759
01:04:30,331 --> 01:04:31,508
Essential scheme.

760
01:04:31,509 --> 01:04:32,709
Yes.

761
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:33,810
Those were the first two words

762
01:04:33,811 --> 01:04:35,511
that I deciphered from this puzzle

763
01:04:35,512 --> 01:04:36,512
I thought that is...

764
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:39,689
I.. I.. I thought that is weird.

765
01:04:43,877 --> 01:04:46,356
This word that seems out of place to me.

766
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:49,056
It's a six-letter word for get together.

767
01:04:50,275 --> 01:04:51,899
Soirée!

768
01:04:52,477 --> 01:04:55,559
Soirée could mean party,
how does a party help us?

769
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,860
Well, I guess... I thought that

770
01:04:57,861 --> 01:05:00,261
you know, a party is interesting

771
01:05:00,262 --> 01:05:03,262
because this thing
out there is an animal

772
01:05:03,263 --> 01:05:05,863
and probably has a very
keen sense of smell.

773
01:05:05,864 --> 01:05:07,664
Why is everyone staring at me?

774
01:05:07,665 --> 01:05:09,265
Go on, go on Mr. Dury, Go on!

775
01:05:10,932 --> 01:05:14,014
Humans have a ponging smell to animals, so

776
01:05:14,465 --> 01:05:17,036
I thought that maybe
everyone gethered together

777
01:05:17,037 --> 01:05:19,237
would confuse him and he wouldn't be
able to distinguish her

778
01:05:19,238 --> 01:05:21,238
from amongst all of us.

779
01:05:21,239 --> 01:05:22,239
Wow!

780
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,440
Is that sound right?

781
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:25,641
He's hearing the voice of God
for a cross word puzzle

782
01:05:25,642 --> 01:05:27,242
He's playing here, right?

783
01:05:27,322 --> 01:05:29,009
Wait, wait!

784
01:05:31,563 --> 01:05:36,467
I don't think that the Great Eathlon
will land in the presence of

785
01:05:36,468 --> 01:05:38,168
beings not from its world.

786
01:05:38,169 --> 01:05:40,969
She didn't want me to watch
when the eagle came for the first time.

787
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:43,170
But that was before she knew
that I was the Guardian.

788
01:05:43,171 --> 01:05:44,571
Will I be allowed to watch now?

789
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:51,468
There are hundreds of people at the party,
it won't work, it won't work,

790
01:05:51,469 --> 01:05:53,669
see if there's anything
else in there Mr. Dury.

791
01:05:56,387 --> 01:05:59,233
This word did give me
a great difficulty.....

792
01:05:59,234 --> 01:06:01,034
Sonorous!

793
01:06:03,038 --> 01:06:07,892
It could mean music. A band.
Maybe we gether everyone inside

794
01:06:07,893 --> 01:06:09,893
at the last minute to hear a band

795
01:06:09,894 --> 01:06:12,894
and we -who are of the world-

796
01:06:12,895 --> 01:06:14,895
stay with her to help her

797
01:06:14,896 --> 01:06:16,896
... with that thing and

798
01:06:17,097 --> 01:06:18,897
... until she is taken!

799
01:06:21,067 --> 01:06:22,494
He's a prophet!

800
01:06:23,971 --> 01:06:25,519
No, no, no no no no no!

801
01:06:26,487 --> 01:06:28,747
I think that it worked!
I think that it worked!

802
01:06:29,083 --> 01:06:31,995
That is why they're the Guild!

803
01:06:31,996 --> 01:06:34,796
I think, they're supposed to use
their hands to throw us a party!

804
01:06:36,583 --> 01:06:38,522
We're gonna throw a party!

805
01:06:38,523 --> 01:06:40,523
Huge party! Serious...

806
01:06:56,805 --> 01:06:58,724
You don't think this is
gonna work, do you?

807
01:07:01,196 --> 01:07:02,672
I'm nervous too.

808
01:07:04,196 --> 01:07:06,453
You'll be out there tomorrow night,

809
01:07:07,452 --> 01:07:10,065
me not knowing
what to do as the Guardian.

810
01:07:12,819 --> 01:07:16,211
I think I can go out there tonigh
maybe face that thing without you?

811
01:07:18,164 --> 01:07:20,090
Get a little practice with him?

812
01:07:20,566 --> 01:07:22,364
Scare him maybe?

813
01:07:22,937 --> 01:07:24,391
Show him who's the boss?

814
01:07:25,191 --> 01:07:26,488
Hm?

815
01:07:28,723 --> 01:07:30,198
I know you wanna get home.

816
01:07:40,125 --> 01:07:41,559
You will need a mirror.

817
01:07:43,251 --> 01:07:44,649
Can you hear me?

818
01:07:44,765 --> 01:07:46,347
I'm here.

819
01:07:46,348 --> 01:07:48,148
Peer over your shoulder carefully!

820
01:07:48,149 --> 01:07:52,349
It is only through a mirror that one can
see the eyes of a Scrunt in the grass.

821
01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:56,550
It will appear to you as two
red spots in the darkness.

822
01:07:59,905 --> 01:08:01,265
Ya, I don't.. I.. I...

823
01:08:05,647 --> 01:08:07,055
I.. I see him!

824
01:08:10,575 --> 01:08:13,636
The Guardian has instincts of
when the Scrunt will attack

825
01:08:13,637 --> 01:08:15,037
is a great weapon against him.

826
01:08:17,162 --> 01:08:20,669
You should walk backwards
towards him.

827
01:08:21,976 --> 01:08:24,811
When you are close enough
to be certain of his position

828
01:08:24,812 --> 01:08:27,012
turn and face the hidden Scrunt!

829
01:08:32,031 --> 01:08:33,295
I'm facing him!

830
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:36,281
I am scared!

831
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:39,502
He's about to get very dangerous!

832
01:08:41,156 --> 01:08:41,967
Ok!

833
01:08:44,155 --> 01:08:45,535
I'm ready!

834
01:08:46,801 --> 01:08:51,312
You must invoke the ancient words:
Neph Rah Mora.

835
01:08:52,053 --> 01:08:54,214
It is a command to rise,

836
01:08:54,812 --> 01:08:56,773
and a challenge to fight.

837
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:03,729
Neph Rah Mora.

838
01:09:06,664 --> 01:09:08,067
What is happening?

839
01:09:10,537 --> 01:09:12,345
He's rising out of grass.

840
01:09:13,898 --> 01:09:15,785
His legs are bending and coiling

841
01:09:18,536 --> 01:09:20,796
underneath... Oh my God!

842
01:09:25,072 --> 01:09:26,792
He's standing in front of me.

843
01:09:26,593 --> 01:09:27,993
The Guardian can hypnotise the Scrunt

844
01:09:27,994 --> 01:09:29,994
if the Guardian looks directly
into the Scrunt's eyes

845
01:09:29,995 --> 01:09:33,395
it will be compelled to stay frozen
or move backwards.

846
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:38,230
What is the Jaygee Scrunt's reaction?
Is he frightened?

847
01:09:38,764 --> 01:09:40,026
I'm not sure!

848
01:09:40,114 --> 01:09:41,670
Look into his eyes!

849
01:09:41,671 --> 01:09:42,771
I am!

850
01:09:42,772 --> 01:09:44,172
Is he moving away?

851
01:09:44,173 --> 01:09:45,173
No!

852
01:09:45,174 --> 01:09:46,974
The Guardian can controll his mind,

853
01:09:46,975 --> 01:09:49,775
the Jaygee Scrunt will not
be able to attack!

854
01:09:50,774 --> 01:09:51,750
Ok!

855
01:09:51,751 --> 01:09:53,751
You must look into his eyes!

856
01:09:55,193 --> 01:09:56,971
I think something's wrong!

857
01:09:57,341 --> 01:09:58,861
He's stepping forward!

858
01:10:00,256 --> 01:10:01,631
He's stepping forward?

859
01:10:01,632 --> 01:10:03,232
Something's wrong!

860
01:10:06,322 --> 01:10:08,526
Cleveland run!

861
01:10:14,673 --> 01:10:17,333
What is it you are doing?

862
01:10:20,107 --> 01:10:21,518
Uuh... uuh.

863
01:10:23,669 --> 01:10:27,526
Is there anything I can do for you Mr. F.. Farber?

864
01:10:28,881 --> 01:10:30,208
No.

865
01:10:37,599 --> 01:10:40,448
So, how was the... movie?

866
01:10:40,649 --> 01:10:41,849
Sucked.

867
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:42,850
Oh, what a shame.

868
01:10:42,851 --> 01:10:45,451
Characters were walking around
saying their thoughts out loud.

869
01:10:46,752 --> 01:10:48,076
Who does that?

870
01:10:48,681 --> 01:10:51,199
In a typical romance with a couple
finally tell each other

871
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,400
they love one another in the rain.

872
01:10:54,971 --> 01:10:58,300
Why does everyone like to stand
around and talk in the rain in movies?

873
01:10:58,301 --> 01:10:59,501
Huh, I think that...

874
01:10:59,502 --> 01:11:00,502
Maybe ...

875
01:11:02,464 --> 01:11:06,277
Maybe it's a methaphor for a purification starting new?

876
01:11:07,875 --> 01:11:09,411
No! It's not!

877
01:11:10,932 --> 01:11:12,237
Are you Ok?

878
01:11:14,586 --> 01:11:17,391
He'll choose to move only
when noone is looking.

879
01:11:17,738 --> 01:11:19,145
They're the masters of hiding.

880
01:11:20,091 --> 01:11:23,189
Scrunt will hide unless he
cannot hide in his enviroment.

881
01:11:24,461 --> 01:11:26,794
If a tenant hadn't walked by,

882
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:29,564
I might have been eaten alive.

883
01:11:31,894 --> 01:11:33,885
I had no powers over him.

884
01:11:34,567 --> 01:11:36,392
You're not the Guardian.

885
01:11:38,372 --> 01:11:40,493
I do not understand.

886
01:11:47,215 --> 01:11:49,659
I cannot protect you.

887
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:53,233
Where are the Thatuthic?

888
01:11:53,234 --> 01:11:55,234
Why isn't he being punished?

889
01:11:56,385 --> 01:11:58,254
Where is the justice?

890
01:12:17,486 --> 01:12:20,417
How come you don't ask
about bedtime story anymore?

891
01:12:22,919 --> 01:12:25,219
I've been busy.

892
01:12:31,819 --> 01:12:34,269
Are you coming at the party tonight?

893
01:12:34,986 --> 01:12:36,616
I have to study.

894
01:12:37,531 --> 01:12:38,697
Bye Mr. Heep!

895
01:12:45,112 --> 01:12:48,409
Mr. Leeds, did you
hear about the party?

896
01:12:53,112 --> 01:12:55,086
Are you coming?

897
01:12:56,352 --> 01:12:58,876
Does man deserved
to be saved, Mr. Heep?

898
01:12:58,877 --> 01:13:00,077
What?

899
01:13:00,078 --> 01:13:01,478
Man.

900
01:13:04,776 --> 01:13:06,047
Yes!

901
01:13:06,910 --> 01:13:08,679
That's not the answer I expected.

902
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:11,280
Why do you ask me that?

903
01:13:12,761 --> 01:13:14,388
I know about your family.

904
01:13:15,511 --> 01:13:17,665
I looked you up when
you started working here.

905
01:13:19,255 --> 01:13:20,780
I know someone killed them.

906
01:13:21,664 --> 01:13:23,016
But you can't give up.

907
01:13:23,581 --> 01:13:25,677
You can't hide here, son.

908
01:13:27,506 --> 01:13:28,838
I know.

909
01:13:29,384 --> 01:13:31,275
You don't wanna become like me.

910
01:13:32,844 --> 01:13:36,350
By the way your invitation would sound
more real if it had the guy's name on it.

911
01:13:37,389 --> 01:13:39,875
There's something strange
going on around this building,

912
01:13:39,876 --> 01:13:41,876
don't think I haven't noticed!

913
01:13:49,385 --> 01:13:51,212
It is finished?

914
01:13:54,035 --> 01:13:55,949
You can see things in the future.

915
01:13:56,697 --> 01:13:58,416
Some things.

916
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:01,224
I've a question to ask you.

917
01:14:02,603 --> 01:14:05,603
I will do my best to answer it.

918
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,654
You'll tell me the truth, right?

919
01:14:09,822 --> 01:14:11,379
Yes.

920
01:14:12,205 --> 01:14:15,761
Change does't  happen the way
you say it's gonna happen

921
01:14:15,962 --> 01:14:18,962
without dramatic events
that accelerate thinking.

922
01:14:20,537 --> 01:14:25,442
I wrote this thing it might takes decades
or longer to create a reaction.

923
01:14:26,358 --> 01:14:28,775
Before anchors in the conciousness.

924
01:14:29,884 --> 01:14:32,748
That's not the type of change
you tell me is gonna happen, right?

925
01:14:35,156 --> 01:14:37,748
I was wondering why he didn't meet me.

926
01:14:39,438 --> 01:14:41,352
This leader who is just a boy,

927
01:14:42,238 --> 01:14:44,594
if he's so inspired by my words,

928
01:14:44,687 --> 01:14:47,414
why didn't he try to meet me?

929
01:14:48,402 --> 01:14:51,616
There's a lot of things in this cook-book
people won't like to hear.

930
01:14:55,204 --> 01:14:57,319
I'm not anything... you know,

931
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:59,120
I don't think I'm anything special.

932
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:02,468
So I started thinking
how is this gonna happen?

933
01:15:03,619 --> 01:15:07,181
Why are people gonna
suddenly take me seriously

934
01:15:08,818 --> 01:15:10,672
and why didn't he meet me?

935
01:15:13,739 --> 01:15:16,146
And I thought of how it could happen?

936
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:19,290
Story, I wanted to ask you...

937
01:15:18,891 --> 01:15:21,291
is something gonna happen to me?

938
01:15:23,229 --> 01:15:25,674
Someone gonna kill me
because I write this?

939
01:15:26,356 --> 01:15:27,810
Yes.

940
01:15:29,071 --> 01:15:32,051
Man thinks that they're
each alone in this world.

941
01:15:33,164 --> 01:15:34,819
It is not true.

942
01:15:35,968 --> 01:15:37,805
You're all connected.

943
01:15:38,938 --> 01:15:42,005
One act can one day affect all.

944
01:15:47,443 --> 01:15:50,100
What are you guys whispering about?

945
01:15:51,131 --> 01:15:54,014
Is he trying to get to tell you
how many kids he's gonna have?

946
01:15:54,015 --> 01:15:56,515
I told him 8 all pretty boys.

947
01:15:57,626 --> 01:16:00,650
I asked her if she knew the name
of the deaf, dumb and blind guy

948
01:16:00,651 --> 01:16:02,451
that's gonna marry you.

949
01:16:02,788 --> 01:16:04,221
Very funny!

950
01:16:17,498 --> 01:16:18,475
Ok.

951
01:16:20,238 --> 01:16:22,636
Don't tell my sister.

952
01:16:53,742 --> 01:16:57,096
Hi! I'm Mr. Farber!

953
01:16:59,564 --> 01:17:01,292
I wanted to thank you!

954
01:17:02,273 --> 01:17:06,885
I was completely
suprised by all of this!

955
01:17:07,903 --> 01:17:11,116
I was expecting some
kind of greeting, of course,

956
01:17:13,441 --> 01:17:16,212
but this is beyond my expectations.

957
01:17:18,866 --> 01:17:20,888
I'm 13B.

958
01:17:21,844 --> 01:17:25,491
- Oh yeah, good for you!
- Yeah, what's up!

959
01:17:26,505 --> 01:17:29,226
I know of your future Cleveland.

960
01:17:30,458 --> 01:17:32,117
Do you wanna hear it?

961
01:17:32,118 --> 01:17:33,118
No.

962
01:17:35,959 --> 01:17:39,648
Tell me what happens when
the eagle takes you back.

963
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:43,330
It is only what I've been told by others.

964
01:17:44,389 --> 01:17:48,931
They tell us the World will line up
and reveal we are on the right path.

965
01:17:49,836 --> 01:17:52,345
Then the Universe will give us signs.

966
01:17:53,071 --> 01:17:54,881
The Thatuthic has not come yet.

967
01:17:55,282 --> 01:17:58,482
I can still sense this Scrunts presence near here.

968
01:17:59,288 --> 01:18:03,713
You have to believe that
this all makes sense somehow.

969
01:18:07,503 --> 01:18:10,234
I don't know why I'm the Madam Narf.

970
01:18:10,747 --> 01:18:12,369
I'm not special.

971
01:18:12,612 --> 01:18:15,007
Clumps even make fun of me.

972
01:18:15,531 --> 01:18:17,740
I don't know how to lead.

973
01:18:20,145 --> 01:18:23,571
Do you get sick everytime you break the rule?

974
01:18:24,626 --> 01:18:27,327
Everytime that you tell me
something that you shouldn't.

975
01:18:31,169 --> 01:18:33,606
There's a storm coming.

976
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:39,506
I am scared.

977
01:18:39,507 --> 01:18:41,707
That's Ok to be scared.

978
01:18:41,708 --> 01:18:43,708
I do not have courage.

979
01:18:45,285 --> 01:18:47,664
I do not want to be a Madam Narf.

980
01:18:47,665 --> 01:18:49,465
You do what you think is right!

981
01:18:49,766 --> 01:18:51,566
You are very brave!

982
01:18:53,347 --> 01:18:55,759
You were always meant to lead, Story!

983
01:18:59,903 --> 01:19:01,147
Cleveland!

984
01:19:03,166 --> 01:19:05,565
The Great Eathlon is coming!

985
01:20:23,006 --> 01:20:25,221
I'm glad you've read my junk.

986
01:20:26,939 --> 01:20:28,429
Don't worry!

987
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:29,930
We're all watching you!

988
01:21:04,563 --> 01:21:06,850
Come on, the music should have started already.

989
01:21:09,324 --> 01:21:11,661
Do not leave this spot!

990
01:21:14,492 --> 01:21:15,590
Hey!

991
01:21:25,314 --> 01:21:26,996
Find a mirror!

992
01:22:21,611 --> 01:22:24,477
Why hasn't the music started?

993
01:22:24,478 --> 01:22:27,778
It's been working smooth.
We've been playing with it all night.

994
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:31,543
You've used up the battery!

995
01:22:32,264 --> 01:22:34,003
Wave to him!

996
01:22:43,404 --> 01:22:46,283
They told that all the Universe
will line up and reveal

997
01:22:46,284 --> 01:22:48,684
that we are on the right.. path.

998
01:22:49,985 --> 01:22:52,056
Why isn't this working?

999
01:23:21,154 --> 01:23:22,158
Ok.

1000
01:23:35,218 --> 01:23:37,975
Sometimes animals just look dead.

1001
01:23:43,463 --> 01:23:44,809
Something went wrong.

1002
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:45,810
They took her inside.

1003
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:19,734
It is not time for you to go.

1004
01:24:22,606 --> 01:24:25,087
It is not time

1005
01:24:25,088 --> 01:24:26,488
for you to go.

1006
01:24:34,953 --> 01:24:37,211
Isn't this supposed to work?

1007
01:24:41,963 --> 01:24:44,808
Fourteen cross...

1008
01:24:47,824 --> 01:24:50,028
No, no...

1009
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:55,690
I don't know.

1010
01:24:57,455 --> 01:24:58,959
I don't know.

1011
01:25:02,609 --> 01:25:06,731
This world is about finding
your purpose, right?

1012
01:25:07,514 --> 01:25:11,182
And the only way to do that is to find
your own voice you told us that.

1013
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:15,865
I don't feel like an Interpreter.

1014
01:25:16,248 --> 01:25:18,877
Is it possible that it isn't my purpose?

1015
01:25:20,848 --> 01:25:23,875
I don't see anything in these words,
that I didn't before!

1016
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:30,547
Finding one's purpose is a profound thing.

1017
01:25:30,952 --> 01:25:33,094
Sometimes it isn't always what it seems.

1018
01:25:37,416 --> 01:25:39,554
What if these young men are not the Guild?

1019
01:25:39,255 --> 01:25:40,555
Look at what happened at the party!

1020
01:25:40,993 --> 01:25:43,493
These things haven't seemed right
from the beginning.

1021
01:25:43,494 --> 01:25:47,094
Why are you so certain that I'm
the interpreter and they are the Guild.

1022
01:25:51,928 --> 01:25:54,014
He was so sure!

1023
01:25:54,678 --> 01:25:56,164
What?

1024
01:25:56,769 --> 01:25:58,979
I ...

1025
01:25:59,514 --> 01:26:01,515
... asked someone.

1026
01:26:02,192 --> 01:26:04,074
He acted like he knew.

1027
01:26:04,627 --> 01:26:08,206
What kind of person would be so arrogant
to persumed to know the intention

1028
01:26:08,207 --> 01:26:09,807
of another human being?

1029
01:26:09,808 --> 01:26:12,008
Who was put this young
girl's life in jeopardy?

1030
01:26:18,977 --> 01:26:20,595
Hallo!

1031
01:26:27,815 --> 01:26:30,856
Is the bathroom on this level working?

1032
01:26:33,431 --> 01:26:35,483
A dog inside the building?

1033
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:38,478
Go! Shoot!

1034
01:26:44,416 --> 01:26:46,188
Oh you're not a dog at all!

1035
01:26:49,753 --> 01:26:51,203
My God!

1036
01:26:52,011 --> 01:26:54,541
This is like a moment
from a horror movie.

1037
01:26:56,965 --> 01:27:00,094
This precisely the moment
where the mutation or beast

1038
01:27:00,458 --> 01:27:03,427
will attempt to kill an
unlikeable side character.

1039
01:27:04,266 --> 01:27:07,495
But in stories where there has
been no prior cursing,

1040
01:27:07,496 --> 01:27:11,396
nudity, killing or death,
such as in a family film,

1041
01:27:11,969 --> 01:27:15,583
the unlikeable character will
narrowly escape his encounter,

1042
01:27:15,907 --> 01:27:18,363
and be referenced to get later in the story

1043
01:27:18,564 --> 01:27:20,764
having learn valuable lessons.

1044
01:27:22,082 --> 01:27:24,800
He may even be given a humourous
moment to allow the audience

1045
01:27:24,801 --> 01:27:26,601
to feel good about.

1046
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:32,474
This is where I turn to run.

1047
01:27:32,615 --> 01:27:34,492
You will leap for me,

1048
01:27:35,155 --> 01:27:37,126
I will shut the door,

1049
01:27:38,104 --> 01:27:41,642
and you will land a fraction
of a second too late.

1050
01:27:44,394 --> 01:27:46,746
Why would they lie to her about the Thatuthic?

1051
01:27:46,747 --> 01:27:49,347
This cannot just be fairytales
that they tell to make the Narfs

1052
01:27:49,789 --> 01:27:52,230
risk their lives this is gotta be about faith!

1053
01:27:52,429 --> 01:27:55,123
Her world works by different rules
and she may not be dead.

1054
01:27:55,524 --> 01:27:56,924
We need to be told what to do.

1055
01:27:56,925 --> 01:27:58,425
We need to find the interpreter.

1056
01:27:58,426 --> 01:28:01,026
But how are we suddenly gonna
realise someone's purpose?

1057
01:28:01,027 --> 01:28:03,027
This is somebody's doing something ancient,

1058
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:04,628
an ancient thing in modern times.

1059
01:28:04,629 --> 01:28:06,429
Could be someone who sees purity

1060
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:07,830
in what we see as mundane.

1061
01:28:07,831 --> 01:28:09,831
Sees the voice of God in the ordinary.

1062
01:28:09,832 --> 01:28:12,032
Yes, someone who sees
meaning in the ordinary.

1063
01:28:12,033 --> 01:28:14,533
Does anyone have any idea who this is?

1064
01:28:18,327 --> 01:28:19,712
My God!

1065
01:28:21,974 --> 01:28:23,290
I do!

1066
01:28:24,429 --> 01:28:26,023
There is a message.

1067
01:28:29,407 --> 01:28:31,677
There is a ceremony to be done.

1068
01:28:31,678 --> 01:28:32,978
You're doing great, Joey!

1069
01:28:32,979 --> 01:28:33,979
Ssssh!

1070
01:28:36,327 --> 01:28:40,036
The hands of the Guild will be
needed plus two others.

1071
01:28:40,951 --> 01:28:43,364
Joey, who is the Guild?

1072
01:28:46,249 --> 01:28:49,006
It is a ceremony of seven sisters.

1073
01:28:49,645 --> 01:28:51,630
Sisters? The Guild is women?

1074
01:28:53,425 --> 01:28:56,490
They will touch together
with their hearts as one

1075
01:28:56,491 --> 01:28:58,491
to bring strenghts to the moment.

1076
01:28:59,214 --> 01:29:00,563
- Nice, Joey!
- Sssssh!

1077
01:29:03,707 --> 01:29:06,427
You will need a man who has no secrets,

1078
01:29:06,428 --> 01:29:08,428
and one who's oppinion is highly respected

1079
01:29:08,429 --> 01:29:10,229
as witnesses.

1080
01:29:12,335 --> 01:29:13,348
Almost three.

1081
01:29:14,307 --> 01:29:15,909
This whole all be over in moments.

1082
01:29:46,422 --> 01:29:47,632
Mr. Perez de la Torre!

1083
01:29:49,730 --> 01:29:54,432
I need to speak with your five daughters.

1084
01:29:59,304 --> 01:30:00,409
Honey!

1085
01:30:00,610 --> 01:30:02,310
Honey there's some
people here to see you.

1086
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:11,901
Sweetheart!

1087
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:15,503
He's probably rinsing his mouth.

1088
01:30:16,004 --> 01:30:17,737
He's got terrible breath.

1089
01:30:18,347 --> 01:30:19,585
Don't tell him I told you!

1090
01:31:51,728 --> 01:31:54,191
I think we have everybody.

1091
01:31:57,386 --> 01:32:01,176
A man who has no secrets

1092
01:32:01,988 --> 01:32:07,162
and one whose oppinion
I greatly respect.

1093
01:32:07,523 --> 01:32:10,621
They will be the witnesses.

1094
01:32:12,139 --> 01:32:15,470
will the Guild please come forward.

1095
01:32:23,548 --> 01:32:26,065
and you make seven.

1096
01:32:26,066 --> 01:32:27,966
Seven sisters.

1097
01:32:35,075 --> 01:32:36,337
Yeah.

1098
01:32:37,371 --> 01:32:38,935
Everything's right now.

1099
01:32:44,335 --> 01:32:46,282
Come back to us now.

1100
01:32:47,636 --> 01:32:51,531
Come back to us now honey,
come back to us!

1101
01:32:58,355 --> 01:32:59,901
I can't believe this!

1102
01:32:59,902 --> 01:33:01,302
This is crazy!

1103
01:33:01,303 --> 01:33:02,903
This woman is probably dying

1104
01:33:02,904 --> 01:33:04,204
as we're talking!

1105
01:33:04,205 --> 01:33:05,505
She needs to get to a hospital!

1106
01:33:05,506 --> 01:33:06,906
She is not right!

1107
01:33:06,907 --> 01:33:09,107
We can't just stand here
playing make believe.

1108
01:33:10,367 --> 01:33:12,253
I wanted to believe more than most.

1109
01:33:13,445 --> 01:33:15,839
I wanna be like child again!

1110
01:33:16,835 --> 01:33:19,236
I needed to believe that there's something
more than this awfulness around us

1111
01:33:19,237 --> 01:33:21,037
but at some point we have to stop!

1112
01:33:21,038 --> 01:33:22,038
Mr. Leeds!

1113
01:33:22,039 --> 01:33:25,439
It is time to proof some stories are real!

1114
01:33:28,070 --> 01:33:29,140
I read it wrong.

1115
01:33:34,601 --> 01:33:36,268
It was my first time,

1116
01:33:36,269 --> 01:33:39,069
I thought that it said she will lead
the ceremony of the seven sisters

1117
01:33:39,070 --> 01:33:40,870
to bring strenghts to the moment.

1118
01:33:42,559 --> 01:33:44,458
I looked at it again.

1119
01:33:44,982 --> 01:33:46,479
It says he,

1120
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,780
he will lead the ceremony of seven sisters

1121
01:33:48,781 --> 01:33:50,981
to bring strenghts to the moment.

1122
01:33:52,737 --> 01:33:55,066
Mrs. Bell is not the Healer.

1123
01:33:56,355 --> 01:33:58,709
It said the Healer could be a man?

1124
01:33:59,391 --> 01:34:01,442
I.. I.. I saw a butterfly right on her!

1125
01:34:01,443 --> 01:34:02,643
Butterflies?

1126
01:34:02,644 --> 01:34:03,844
The bedtime story said

1127
01:34:03,845 --> 01:34:04,845
butterflies are drawn to the Healer.

1128
01:34:06,467 --> 01:34:08,524
Oh, Mr. Heep, you brought
that butterfly to me!

1129
01:34:08,849 --> 01:34:11,448
It cought my eyes you walked over.

1130
01:34:14,568 --> 01:34:15,997
I did?

1131
01:34:15,998 --> 01:34:17,198
Oh, wow!

1132
01:34:19,578 --> 01:34:20,813
Oh!

1133
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:24,195
Wait, no!

1134
01:34:25,032 --> 01:34:26,619
You must try!

1135
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:27,620
There's no time!

1136
01:34:27,621 --> 01:34:29,021
I can't, I can't, I can't!

1137
01:34:30,045 --> 01:34:31,167
Shut up!

1138
01:34:32,528 --> 01:34:33,811
And try!

1139
01:35:15,294 --> 01:35:17,898
Say something to bring out your energy.

1140
01:35:22,546 --> 01:35:25,057
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you!

1141
01:35:31,623 --> 01:35:33,904
I should have been there.

1142
01:35:33,905 --> 01:35:35,705
I am always gonna regret

1143
01:35:38,110 --> 01:35:39,999
just not being there.

1144
01:35:46,382 --> 01:35:48,466
How I miss your faces!

1145
01:35:51,625 --> 01:35:54,338
How they remind me of God!

1146
01:36:00,362 --> 01:36:02,951
I'm so lost without you guys!

1147
01:36:08,851 --> 01:36:11,813
I met this very nice lady and

1148
01:36:12,180 --> 01:36:13,952
her name is Story.

1149
01:36:15,868 --> 01:36:17,686
I think you would have liked her.

1150
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:24,331
I think she might be...

1151
01:36:24,732 --> 01:36:25,732
an angel.

1152
01:36:29,587 --> 01:36:31,712
But she has to go home.

1153
01:36:36,496 --> 01:36:38,823
I love you all.

1154
01:36:40,361 --> 01:36:42,781
I love you all so much!

1155
01:37:28,781 --> 01:37:31,794
Thank you for all you have done!

1156
01:37:43,719 --> 01:37:45,964
Your sister will have seven children.

1157
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:49,263
You will see the first two.

1158
01:40:04,277 --> 01:40:06,020
Oh my God!

1159
01:40:06,121 --> 01:40:07,721
He's the Guardian!

1160
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:10,307
Reggie!

1161
01:40:10,308 --> 01:40:12,508
Reggie, Reggie just keep
looking in his eyes!

1162
01:40:12,509 --> 01:40:14,109
Keep looking in his eyes!

1163
01:42:01,241 --> 01:42:03,856
Thank you for saving my life.
