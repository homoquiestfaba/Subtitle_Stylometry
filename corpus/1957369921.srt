1
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:14,801
Why would I lie?

2
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,137
Come on!

3
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:17,929
Whoa!

4
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:18,764
Wanna slow down?

5
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:19,598
Trying to get me killed?

6
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:20,557
I'm talking to my ex-wife.

7
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:21,516
Which one?

8
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,645
Honey, I left you a hundred messages,

9
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,563
the check's been in the
mail for three days.

10
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:27,939
No, I'm not mad.

11
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:28,732
This is not mad.

12
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,651
This, this is mad!

13
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,653
When I'm like this, this is mad!

14
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,613
This, this is not mad.

15
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,323
Ah, fuck.

16
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,241
You know, you need to be
more sensitive to her needs,

17
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,661
because women have
different needs than we do.

18
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,454
What are you reading, Cosmo lately?

19
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:43,330
Hey, look who's talking.

20
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:44,915
You're the one with the three ex-wives.

21
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,458
Yeah, which means I
got laid three times,

22
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,086
which is more than I can
say for you, Father Neil.

23
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,004
I'll tell you the truth,

24
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,255
I'm surprised you're not
getting laid that much.

25
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,423
I mean, you're in a great shape.

26
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,884
I mean, probably they
make vegetables different

27
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,011
where you're from, huh?

28
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,971
What are you
talking about where I'm from?

29
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,348
I'm from Florida!

30
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:02,182
I need some.

31
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,018
You know, maybe you'll give
me some of that gin thing,

32
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,603
that dick juice stuff.

33
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:07,938
Ginseng.

34
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:08,897
There's the van.

35
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,574
Can you believe this?

36
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,160
Looks like a damn cop convention.

37
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:23,370
Amateurs.

38
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,247
Real farmers.

39
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,249
I got a thing about farmers, you know.

40
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,878
Come on, come on, get
the lead out, asshole.

41
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:32,963
Where the hell you two been?

42
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:33,797
You're supposed to be helping me

43
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,549
get these shipping orders ready.

44
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,385
Car trouble.

45
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,763
Billy boy here thinks oil's
only for salads and hair.

46
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,140
Yeah, well just get to work.

47
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:43,974
Boss is coming in this morning,

48
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,476
I don't want anything going wrong.

49
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,561
When's he due?

50
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,189
Soon.

51
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:52,649
What the fuck is it to you?

52
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,569
I just want to make sure he notices

53
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,237
what a good job we're doing.

54
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,991
Well, you just do your
job, or I'll notice.

55
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,033
And you know what?

56
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,077
You won't fuckin' like that.

57
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:06,371
Hey, Roland.

58
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,206
Look what I found.

59
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,041
Isn't this your old flame?

60
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,713
Hi, Roland.

61
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:16,715
What the fuck are you doing here?

62
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:17,549
You know what?

63
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,342
I oughta kick your fuckin' ass.

64
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,679
Bruno sent me for some stuff.

65
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,139
Just a small bag.

66
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,016
I don't bring any back,

67
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:26,933
he's gonna do this to me again.

68
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,351
Hey, what do I care?

69
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,936
Just because we fucked once don't mean

70
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,480
you can come crying to me.

71
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,733
Look, I ain't no nickel
pusher no more, okay?

72
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:35,650
I'm bigger.

73
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,111
I'm much, much, much bigger here.

74
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:39,780
Please.

75
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:44,743
Yeah, all right.

76
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,537
Give me 50 bucks and
I'll let you have some

77
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,581
just for lookin' so fuckin' pathetic.

78
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,168
This is all I got.

79
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,630
Get the fuck outta here!

80
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:03,887
Neil.

81
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:05,597
We gotta wait for the boss

82
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,474
before we make our move, okay?

83
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,434
All right?

84
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:10,393
Please, baby.

85
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,480
We can work it out somehow.

86
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,066
Like before?

87
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,403
Yeah.

88
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,446
Sure.

89
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,700
Me and April, we'll go in the back,

90
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,702
and I'll give her the stuff.

91
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,872
No!

92
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,207
No?

93
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,124
Never.

94
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,501
Never?

95
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,962
Well, give Bruno my best, okay?

96
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,923
Is he still crushing beer
cans on his head, hm?

97
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,133
Roland, she's only 13 years old!

98
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:46,513
Baby, 13 is my lucky number.

99
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,520
April, honey, come here.

100
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:01,611
Now, you be momma's good little girl.

101
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,489
And you're gonna go with Roland.

102
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,868
He's gonna give you what we've come for.

103
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,913
And you be nice to him now.

104
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,000
And remember your manners.

105
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,381
Come on, April.

106
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,592
It's all right.

107
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,721
I won't hurt you.

108
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:28,680
Come on.

109
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,227
It's okay.

110
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,315
We'll have a really good
time together, you and me.

111
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,316
Hey, Roland!

112
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,610
Maybe this isn't such
a good idea right now.

113
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,195
What's it to you?

114
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:46,948
I just don't want something to go wrong,

115
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:47,866
make the rest of us look bad.

116
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,035
Get the fuck out of my face, asshole!

117
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,411
Or you will take her place,

118
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,580
and I won't be as nice with you.

119
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,125
All right, all right, we're on it.

120
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,668
I got the trucks rollin'.

121
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,966
The fuck is wrong with you, huh?

122
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,260
We've been taking this
guy's shit for 8 months.

123
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,595
Roland's gonna do to this girl

124
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,222
what he was gonna do with
the girl anyway, all right?

125
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,808
Now when the boss shows
up and we bust this fuck,

126
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,561
you bang his nuts through his asshole.

127
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,396
I'll say he slipped and fell.

128
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,356
Okay?

129
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,899
Okay?

130
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,078
We're moving, we're moving!

131
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,973
DEA, everybody freeze!

132
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,846
You really stalled him.

133
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:33,805
What?

134
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:37,934
You hungry?

135
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:38,768
Yeah.

136
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,395
Cover me.

137
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:18,850
Fuck.

138
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,226
Are you all right?

139
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,061
No, I'm not all right!

140
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,022
I was just shot, "Am I all right?"

141
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,612
Good thing you had your vest.

142
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,826
Move it, move it, move it!

143
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:20,870
All right, come on, get out of the car!

144
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:21,788
Out of the car!

145
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,623
Now, now, now!

146
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,834
Right there, right there!

147
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,050
What now, DEA man?

148
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:34,884
Huh?

149
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,136
What now?

150
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,762
Just relax!

151
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,514
We can work this out,
nobody needs to get hurt.

152
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:40,431
You shut the fuck up!

153
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,142
I'm doing the talking here.

154
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,434
I'm the one who tells
you how it's gonna be,

155
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,519
you understand that?

156
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:45,770
Absolutely.

157
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:46,729
Drop the gun.

158
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,399
That's not gonna happen, Roland.

159
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,317
Drop the goddamn gun!

160
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,195
I can't do that.

161
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,238
You know it and I know it.

162
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,448
So let's move on to item number two.

163
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:58,950
Escape.

164
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,118
Damn right, escape.

165
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,536
Escape where she ends up flank steak

166
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,329
on the coroner's table tonight!

167
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,372
<i>Okay-</i>

168
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,499
Here's what we're gonna do.

169
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,628
You get in that car by yourself,

170
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,380
and I'm gonna let you drive away.

171
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,008
Just like that?

172
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,551
Just like that.

173
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,638
You think I'm a fuckin' idiot, asshole?

174
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,015
That's against cop policy!

175
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,142
There is no policy right now.

176
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,353
Just you and me doing some business.

177
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,439
You get to live, I get the girl.

178
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:30,273
Fair trade.

179
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:31,983
Bullshit, man, I do not trust you.

180
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:32,817
You have to.

181
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,111
I'm not letting you leave here with her.

182
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,777
How much did we lose?

183
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,197
About 200 G's worth of our
new human growth hormone.

184
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,531
Our best steroids.

185
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,743
And we lost one of our

186
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,912
biggest distributors, right?

187
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:26,955
Yeah.

188
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,915
Uncle Paulie, look.

189
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,252
You don't have an excuse.

190
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:37,340
When I promised your father
that I would take care of you,

191
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,719
I had no idea that you'd
be such a pain in the ass.

192
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,098
Uncle Paulie, look!

193
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,432
She was a fitness instructor.

194
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,934
I thought I could make a new connection.

195
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,687
You were trying to get laid!

196
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,189
And your big mouth
almost got us all busted.

197
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,568
Maybe a little prison time
would be good for you.

198
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,071
Make a man outta ya.

199
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,741
Oh, I'm a man, muscle head.

200
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,619
No, not yet.

201
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:14,627
When your father lost his life,

202
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,379
it was because he wasn't careful.

203
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,216
Now, you're gonna lose something.

204
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,054
Uncle Paulie, don't.

205
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:26,264
Please, I made a mistake, all right?

206
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,016
I promise, it'll never happen again.

207
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,934
You understand, don't you, kid?

208
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,438
This is for your own good.

209
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:34,605
Just let me...

210
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,858
No, Uncle Paulie, please, please!

211
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,109
No, don't!

212
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,338
Have a good time while
you're here in L.A., Doctor.

213
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,006
But when you're finished
with your business,

214
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,800
I don't want to see you in town.

215
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:52,642
Clay, come on.

216
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:55,812
Hey, Clay, let's go.

217
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,146
Come on, man.

218
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,439
Goddamn.

219
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,858
Keep your pants on!

220
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:01,692
What are you still doing...

221
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,611
Get outta here, girl.

222
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:04,529
Hey, Clay, come on.

223
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,572
Let's go, Clay!

224
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,865
What the...

225
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:09,784
Get outta here, girl.

226
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,453
Hey, Clay, Mr. Loverboy,
let's go, come on.

227
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:13,413
Clay.

228
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,332
Clay, quit fartin' around, let's go.

229
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,417
Come on!

230
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,268
Come on!

231
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,603
Take your time.

232
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,438
Shut up.

233
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,397
Hand me the phone.

234
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:41,941
Smooth.

235
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,278
I wonder how many more screw ups before

236
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,779
Paulie starts whittling your dick.

237
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,072
Yeah, well, he promised my father

238
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,949
he would make a man out of me.

239
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:51,868
When he's done cutting down you,

240
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,244
you're gonna have enough parts left over

241
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:54,287
to make one from scratch.

242
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,121
Forget about it.

243
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,664
There's enough leftover-
Hey, shut up.

244
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:57,999
Yeah.

245
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,585
I want to make a report of death.

246
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,337
1212 Mallard Avenue.

247
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,172
Uh huh.

248
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,631
Oh, yeah.

249
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:06,466
For sure.

250
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,592
Mother frickin' Teresa.

251
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:15,725
Come in.

252
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,228
Hey, Chief.

253
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:21,731
Where's De Marco?

254
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,443
He's sick, he's got the fr...

255
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,199
Take a seat, Menardi.

256
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,658
I got hemorrhoids.

257
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,535
This is regional director Walker,

258
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,787
agents Babich and Pope outta D.C.

259
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,331
Yeah, I'm poppin' a pup tent already.

260
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,165
Menardi!

261
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,291
Well, maybe you and your pup tent

262
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,794
would like a month of unpaid
suspension, my friend.

263
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,171
Friend?

264
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,339
Number one, we ain't friends,

265
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,007
and if we were, I'd tell
you to change that tie.

266
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,091
Number two, boss.

267
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,135
What do I look like, an asshole?

268
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,013
You think I don't know
you want me to go under?

269
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:54,847
And if you're gonna come in here,

270
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,724
don't have that fuckin' attitude with me.

271
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,770
I'm gonna let that slide, Menardi.

272
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,189
Maybe I was a little harsh

273
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,359
considering what you and your
partner just went through.

274
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,861
But we've got ourselves a red ball.

275
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,112
You know, they got cream for that.

276
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,365
And we've gotta stop it, fast.

277
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,325
And we need someone with your reputation.

278
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,619
So, what's the product?

279
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,079
Powerful new growth hormone,

280
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,997
unlike anything we've ever seen.

281
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,166
Increases muscular growth
and athletic performance

282
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,627
at three times the rate of
any steroid on the market,

283
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,671
legal or otherwise.

284
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,506
Unfortunately, it's very addictive.

285
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,925
Jacks up the heart rate like
a freight train rolling by.

286
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,844
And so the heart literally
shakes itself apart.

287
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,222
We've had some high
profile deaths lately.

288
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,139
Yeah, I heard.

289
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,267
That pro wrestler, what was his name?

290
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,560
Ball Buster, some-

291
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,270
Ballistic, he was one of ours.

292
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,274
Oh, so he was an agent?

293
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,858
He was a snitch, but he provided us

294
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,694
with enough information
to follow the supplier

295
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,029
all the way back to former East Germany.

296
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,864
Oh, so you want me
and my partner to go in

297
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,366
where you guys already fucked up.

298
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,993
That's what you get paid for, isn't it?

299
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,661
No, that's not what they're paid for.

300
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,413
What they're paid for
is to act responsible

301
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,414
for the public benefit!

302
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,375
And I'm not convinced they're
fit for this assignment.

303
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,754
Well, if they're scared
because someone got killed-

304
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,883
Hey, I'm scared, but not
'cause somebody got killed,

305
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,469
'cause you guys screw up.

306
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,513
And I'm not too comfortable with that.

307
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,098
Listen.

308
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,601
What will it take to clear
these men for re-assignment?

309
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,771
I'll have a departmental
shrink give an evaluation.

310
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,191
If she says they're
okay, then they're yours.

311
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:31,861
I'll need an answer tomorrow.

312
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,529
Let's go.

313
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,048
Jerk offs.

314
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,020
I called, he's not home.

315
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:07,647
He's probably down at the shelter

316
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,023
spooning soup for the homeless.

317
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:10,107
How noble.

318
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:11,859
Yeah, he does that.

319
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,319
He's terrifical in those ways.

320
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,320
Hey, let me tell you something.

321
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:15,488
This guy is clean.

322
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,614
This house, for instance?

323
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,157
This is sewer, not septic.

324
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,201
Look, for De Marco to
remain on active duty,

325
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,828
department policy requires
an in-home evaluation.

326
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,122
If he's not here, he can
start planning his vacation.

327
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:26,832
Hey, De Marco's one of
the straightest arrows

328
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:27,667
on the force.

329
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,501
He's very respected.

330
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,795
It's not his integrity
that's being questioned.

331
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,588
It's his emotional stability.

332
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,050
That's completely understandable.

333
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,303
Emotional.

334
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,139
I guarantee you his elevator
goes to the top floor.

335
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:43,849
It's what we find when the door opens

336
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,101
that interests me.

337
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:50,022
I hear music, and there's
a light on in the back.

338
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,607
Well, turn the knob and walk in,

339
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:52,441
and tomorrow we'll teach you

340
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,026
how to put your own shoes on.

341
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:59,448
I'll tell you another
thing about Neil, Doc.

342
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,659
Very spiritual, you might not know that.

343
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:02,493
Reads a lot.

344
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,161
And I'm not talking paperbacks,

345
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,665
I'm talking hardcore, hard books.

346
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:11,335
Big three, four hundred
pages, no pictures, no sex.

347
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,587
Not that he don't like
sex, but, you know...

348
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,548
Not that weird, you know...

349
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,550
I mean, listen to the music.

350
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,509
-Ah.

351
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:21,637
Violin partita number one.

352
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,264
Number one, huh?

353
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,057
I was thinking number two.

354
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,017
Your partner has very eclectic taste.

355
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,979
Yeah, yeah, he tells
me I smell good a lot.

356
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,148
Well, they're obvious re-productions.

357
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,608
But still, they're quite good,

358
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,194
and they're not cheap.

359
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:38,404
Hey, look.

360
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:39,739
De Marco is the guy your mother

361
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,741
would want you to marry, you know?

362
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,868
He's so honest, he don't take free advice.

363
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,662
This guy's got an 8 inch
scar across his chest.

364
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:47,496
You know why?

365
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,706
'Cause he stepped in front of a guy

366
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,958
that wanted to put an 8 inch
scar in front of my chest

367
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,501
where my heart would've been.

368
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:53,335
You understand?

369
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,296
So, if you want to go in
and see if he wets the bed,

370
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,130
that's one thing,

371
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:57,840
but don't question his integrity.

372
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,967
Look, I'm not here to bust his balls.

373
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,261
But I've been hearing some
very disturbing rumors

374
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:03,554
about De Marco lately.

375
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,056
Even before what happened.

376
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,185
Reckless behavior, needlessly
endangering himself,

377
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,563
now that kind of thing sends
up a red flag in my profession.

378
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,106
Well, you need to get the
bolts tightened in your neck.

379
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,900
Bungee jumping, that's right.

380
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,409
You know, another thing I
didn't tell you about Neil.

381
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:28,662
He's doing a little remodeling, and, yeah,

382
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,206
it could use a few nuts and bolts

383
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,583
like the ones in your
neck I was talking about?

384
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,126
Hey, look, Doc, the guy's stressed out.

385
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,878
He was in a shooting, okay?

386
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,838
I mean, this is good,
this is normal, right?

387
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,590
Read my report in the morning.

388
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:57,900
I'll tell ya...

389
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,362
I love what you've done with the place.

390
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,405
Who was she?

391
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,616
Angel of mercy.

392
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:09,703
Hey, look.

393
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:13,207
They want us to go under
again, something big.

394
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,125
Career maker for some department mutt,

395
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,586
just another grave-digging job for us.

396
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,755
What's the matter?

397
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,382
Losing your taste for the job?

398
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,634
Maybe.

399
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,886
Maybe it's gotten to
the point I don't like

400
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,805
walking with a grenade in my pocket

401
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,432
waiting for somebody to
finger us and pull the pin.

402
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,643
Maybe there's some other options.

403
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,603
Yeah, like what?

404
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:36,188
Security guard at Sears?

405
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:39,525
You know, maybe we pass
on this one, you know?

406
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,528
Do something else, maybe
go down to Florida, huh?

407
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:43,404
Get a boat.

408
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,030
I got that girl killed, Dave.

409
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,615
That is bullshit!

410
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:49,952
If I'd just stayed undercover

411
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,204
and not gone off like some damn cowboy,

412
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:54,957
she might've got hurt a little.

413
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,625
Roland is a maniac.

414
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,544
He would've killed her anyway.

415
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,381
I need this case.

416
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,759
You need this case...

417
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:10,306
All right, you need
this case, I'm with ya.

418
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:14,268
Observations indicate a deep neurosis,

419
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:16,145
that without treatment could develop

420
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,522
into a dangerous psychosis.

421
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,774
I suggest he be re-assigned to desk duty

422
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:24,403
until a more thorough psychological
evaluation can be made.

423
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,620
How you doin,' Doc?

424
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,623
I'm finishing Agent De
Marco's report right now.

425
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,374
This will only take a minute.

426
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:40,669
Chocolate.

427
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:41,879
A bribe?

428
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,547
How quaint.

429
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:44,548
Try the one in the middle.

430
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:46,216
It's nice, creamy.

431
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:48,761
What is this?

432
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,444
Just what do you think you have on me?

433
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:09,406
Some indiscretion when I was 18 years old?

434
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,075
Doc.

435
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,078
I think trying to
overdose on sleeping pills

436
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,413
is more than an indiscretion, but hey.

437
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:17,289
You're the professional.

438
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:18,958
Look, it wasn't a suicide attempt,

439
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,709
I was just depressed, and
I didn't think that it-

440
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,878
All right, look, look, look.

441
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,380
I'm not here to judge you.

442
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,800
I just need you to do the
right thing, that's all.

443
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,512
Enjoy the chocolates.

444
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,071
Who is it?

445
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:52,157
It's Dave, fuck face, open up.

446
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,701
Come on in, it's unlocked.

447
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,747
Hey, what are you doing?

448
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,916
I just stopped by to give you this stuff.

449
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,754
You know, so, what's going on?

450
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,259
Why don't you shake the place down

451
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:11,343
if it'll make you feel any better.

452
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:12,928
Why you gotta break my balls?

453
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:14,513
I'm not allowed to look around?

454
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,974
What you're looking
for is over by the clock.

455
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,396
When are you gonna stop
this lost weekend routine

456
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,564
and get rid of this?

457
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:25,983
It's a reminder.

458
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,234
A reminder of what?

459
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:28,944
You went on a binge for one weekend,

460
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,529
that doesn't make you a drunk.

461
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,907
It's not the drinking
I want to be reminded of,

462
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,075
it's what started it.

463
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,287
-All right, look, look.

464
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,414
Mr. Fun.

465
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:42,166
Me and you are getting
out of here tonight.

466
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,460
We're gonna go over to
Dan Tana's, eat Italian,

467
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:45,878
have a few laughs.

468
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:46,920
I'm buying, okay?

469
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,214
Come on, let's get the fuck outta here.

470
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:57,556
Dan Tana's, huh?

471
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:58,390
Yeah.

472
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,184
You're a regular
Diamond Jim Brady lately.

473
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,643
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

474
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,062
Don't I look handsome?

475
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,065
You didn't even say I look handsome.

476
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:06,982
I know I look handsome.

477
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:07,816
You're handsome, you're handsome.

478
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,903
My mother would say I look handsome.

479
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,446
Business is boomin', boss.

480
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,992
Every athlete, college and pro,

481
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,369
is shooting this stuff
like it was bat juice.

482
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,247
Bat juice?

483
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,749
What the hell you talking about?

484
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,167
Bat juice.

485
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,795
Like what Batman drinks
for his superpowers.

486
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,422
Hey, Batman didn't have
no superpowers, moron!

487
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:31,965
He didn't drink no bat juice.

488
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,593
You must be thinking about
Popeye and his spinach.

489
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,261
And why do you keep wearing
that stuff around here for?

490
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,014
I told you, this ain't no Chippendales.

491
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:39,973
Whatever.

492
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,351
The point is, we're
sitting on a gold mine.

493
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,811
We got athletes crawling up our assholes

494
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:44,895
begging for this stuff,

495
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,731
even after that shitty thing
that happened with Clay.

496
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,109
Well, I wouldn't worry
too much about Clay.

497
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,569
What's that supposed to mean?

498
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,365
Shit happens.

499
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,492
Sometimes for the better.

500
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:16,426
What the hell's wrong with Keko,

501
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,511
he's losing his touch?

502
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:22,307
Money's coming in, it's just
a little slower than usual.

503
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:24,810
Yeah.

504
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,270
How much did you front him?

505
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,524
I'm telling you, a couple of weeks ago

506
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,693
he was pumping this stuff
out like it was Kool-Aid.

507
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,570
I figured he was good for it.

508
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:35,988
It made good business sense, you know.

509
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,532
This ain't no goddamn loan company!

510
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,286
Jesus, Kevin.

511
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:49,793
All right.

512
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,297
I'm gonna tell you what you're gonna do.

513
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,092
You're gonna go find that
little Mexican chihuahua.

514
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,219
I want to hear what he
has to say in person.

515
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:01,805
And go take Sonny with you.

516
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:02,848
Oh, come on, Paulie!

517
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:03,974
The kid's a screw up.

518
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,601
All right.

519
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,561
So he makes mistakes.

520
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:09,479
But how else is he gonna learn, huh?

521
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,317
Crime doesn't come
naturally to other people

522
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,110
like it does for me and you, Kevin.

523
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,201
Now, Kevin Thompson is
Paulie's closest associate.

524
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,328
Kevin's the one who uses
contacts and wrestling

525
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,621
to set up a steroid network,

526
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,706
and he's our ticket to Paulie.

527
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,251
He also runs a couple of
legitimate businesses as covers.

528
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,170
He's got a gym in the marina,

529
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,297
he's also got a junkyard in Sun Valley.

530
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,050
You know, all that information's great,

531
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,718
but when do we make contact?

532
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,094
When we say so.

533
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,304
Walker put us in charge,

534
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,056
so you'll operate according to our book.

535
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,182
Hey, stick the book up your ass.

536
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,434
What is this, Barney Fife goes undercover?

537
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:49,144
Maybe you boys would like
to curl up in a blanket

538
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:50,270
and dream about a big shootout,

539
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,231
me and Pope will continue
the boring surveillance

540
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,523
which actually makes cases

541
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:54,775
and sends some people to jail!

542
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,360
And by the time you guys moved on it,

543
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,320
they'll wheel Paulie out
of his retirement home

544
00:28:58,654 --> 00:28:59,696
to stand trial.

545
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,530
You know, you're right.

546
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,616
Why don't we all four
just dress up in costumes

547
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,493
and go over there and kick
the shit out of Kevin,

548
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:05,702
and then do the same thing to Paulie.

549
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,913
How's that sound, Caped Crusader?

550
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,623
Or better yet, why don't
we forget the costumes

551
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:11,500
and I just come over there
and kick the shit outta you!

552
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,211
You're just jealous I
didn't offer you a drink!

553
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,212
Oh, fuck you!

554
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:16,713
Where the hell's he going?

555
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:17,547
How do I know?

556
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:18,507
I'm not his mother.

557
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,427
You guys got anything to eat?

558
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,581
What can I get you?

559
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:52,666
Cranberry juice.

560
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,627
And could I borrow that
pencil and paper please?

561
00:29:59,214 --> 00:29:59,965
Thanks.

562
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,677
I'd like to order a bottle of Dom.

563
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:06,179
Yeah, right, like this
place carries Dom Pérignon?

564
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,557
Well, the best you got then.

565
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,686
And send it with this note

566
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,147
to the lady sitting over there.

567
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,441
Tell her it's from the
gentleman at the end of the bar.

568
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,496
I'm the one that's gonna
have to clean up the mess.

569
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,628
You're an actress, aren't you?

570
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:44,217
Act.

571
00:30:58,607 --> 00:30:59,608
Now I owe you back.

572
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:02,944
Take a shot.

573
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,080
This is for you.

574
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,874
From the guy at the bar.

575
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,296
Hey, Billy.

576
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,672
Come on, man.

577
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:23,673
I need some more nuts over here.

578
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,801
Yeah, you're gonna need
some more nuts, buddy,

579
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,761
when I'm done ripping yours off.

580
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,057
What's your problem, pal?

581
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,183
What's my problem?

582
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,894
I tell you what my
problem is, monkey face.

583
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,188
I don't like big muscle-bound gorillas

584
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:40,148
trying to pick up on my old lady,

585
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,775
that's my problem.

586
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:42,818
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do,

587
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,152
just because you were so good enough

588
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,196
to buy us all a round of drinks.

589
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,697
Let me return the favor.

590
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,413
That round's on us, buddy.

591
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:00,252
Whew, doggy.

592
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,211
Nice shot.

593
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,500
Hey!

594
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,146
I didn't ask for your help.

595
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,398
We better get out of here.

596
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:04,608
Who the hell are you?

597
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,485
I'm somebody who's got better
things to do with his time

598
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,778
than talking to a bunch of cops.

599
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:10,822
Hey.

600
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,074
I had it under control here.

601
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:23,084
Oh, man.

602
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,215
Going some place, asshole?

603
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,636
This ain't over yet,
fuckin' piece of shit.

604
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,763
Juan, split his fuckin' head open.

605
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:35,931
Come on, come on, hit him.

606
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,265
Hey, batter up!

607
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,038
Hey, nice move.

608
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,666
I guess a little help
was not such a bad thing.

609
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,293
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

610
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,003
Well, I hope the next place

611
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,588
is not as rowdy as the last.

612
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:05,270
Hey, man.

613
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:06,187
I gotta go, okay?

614
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,981
You take care, have a good one.

615
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,650
You made it.

616
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:11,484
How you doin'?

617
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,861
Good, good, good.

618
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:13,987
Nice wheels.

619
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:14,863
Thanks.

620
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,865
Come on in, I'll show you around.

621
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,828
So, what do you think?

622
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,246
Looks great.

623
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,080
Hey, Kim.

624
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:25,415
Kim, come here a minute.

625
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:26,958
Meet Neil Farra.

626
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,294
He just moved here from Vegas.

627
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:30,337
Hi.
Hi.

628
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,213
I want you to take good care of him.

629
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,048
I Will do that.

630
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,049
Fix him up with the deluxe membership.

631
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:38,094
I gotta go work off them
beers and corn nuts.

632
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:39,304
Maybe later you can show me that move

633
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:40,430
from last night, huh?

634
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:41,264
No problem.

635
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:42,474
See ya.

636
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:52,359
So, what move was that?

637
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,029
Oh, I showed him how to parallel park.

638
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:56,946
Really?

639
00:35:58,448 --> 00:35:59,074
Sign there.

640
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:02,452
And did you want personal training?

641
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:03,953
I don't know, do I need one?

642
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,039
Well, if you want to get
the best out of your workout,

643
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:07,290
it would probably be a good idea.

644
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,171
I'll...

645
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,965
Yeah, great, I'll use anybody you want.

646
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,746
Get off!

647
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:28,580
What?

648
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,414
Get the fuck off!

649
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:30,832
You didn't sign up, asshole.

650
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:34,711
What's your problem, buddy?

651
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:35,545
What?

652
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:36,504
Watch this!

653
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,176
OW, Shit.

654
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,022
You're the one that broke
my friend's nose, aren't you?

655
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:56,733
It was unavoidable.

656
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,152
Hey, I'm so tired of
seeing behavior like that,

657
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:00,737
it never solves anything.

658
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,614
-As much as I hate it,

659
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:03,698
I think it solved that problem.

660
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,533
Oh, you're proud of it?

661
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:08,077
Now why would you assume
something like that?

662
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,829
It's obvious in your attitude.

663
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,998
I see you two have met.

664
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:12,999
Marla, Neil.

665
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:15,251
Hi.

666
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:17,712
<i>Okay-</i>

667
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,715
So, what's the story about my trainer?

668
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,760
Well, you just met her.

669
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,431
Marla's really made a big difference,

670
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,518
and I wanted to thank
you for paying for her.

671
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:33,686
No problem.

672
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,897
Nothing but the best for you, darling.

673
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,326
And what do you expect from me?

674
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:55,166
Well, you could come
over and show me more

675
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:00,088
of those new poses that
you've learned, horizontally.

676
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,926
Now, that...

677
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,931
Could be tricky.

678
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,058
Tricky, I like.

679
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:18,606
Those are very nice shoes.

680
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,108
Are they comfortable?

681
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,442
Not really.

682
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,404
Well, good, you keep them on,

683
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:27,031
make me work harder to
keep your mind off of them.

684
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:33,371
You are a silver tongued devil.

685
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,416
Yes, yes, you remember that, huh?

686
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,377
How could I forget?

687
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:43,590
Yum, yum, yum.

688
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:45,884
Yum, yum, yum.

689
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:49,220
Yeah!

690
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,973
No one could beat me!

691
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:10,366
Take that!

692
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,550
Get up!

693
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,302
Come on!

694
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,388
Very impressive.

695
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,475
Baby, I love this shit.

696
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:36,976
You see that kick?

697
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,603
That's the one you taught me.

698
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:39,646
Looked good.

699
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,773
Sloppy, but effective.

700
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,317
Good?

701
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:45,693
Hell, that was perfection!

702
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,070
You better watch out, little man,

703
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,031
because before long, I'm
gonna know all your tricks!

704
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,158
I always keep a few tricks in reserve.

705
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,535
Me too.

706
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:58,247
What is that?

707
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:00,792
Chemical warfare.

708
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,254
Steroids.

709
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,800
You want a taste?

710
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:11,177
Hell no.

711
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:13,096
I heard it makes your dick fall off.

712
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,142
You better watch out, little man,

713
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,394
'cause that's bullshit.

714
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,646
You want to take a peak?

715
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,358
Don't believe everything
you hear on TV, pal.

716
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,027
If you use the stuff the right way,

717
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,279
you'll triple your strength, guaranteed.

718
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,367
In this business,

719
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,954
they come to see the
biggest and the baddest.

720
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:42,125
As long as I've got my little edge here,

721
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,335
that's gonna be me.

722
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:48,715
I got a friend of mine back east,

723
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,967
he's a trainer, hooked into the NFL.

724
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:54,012
Says he can never get enough of this shit.

725
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,180
Is that right?

726
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,308
Well then, guess what?

727
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,270
Today's your lucky day.

728
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,155
This is going way too fast.

729
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,573
Everything goes too fast for you.

730
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,450
When'd you actually cop your first feel,

731
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,868
your golden wedding anniversary?

732
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:17,827
Oh, fuck you!
No, fuck you!

733
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,121
No, fuck you in the ear!
No, fuck you!

734
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:21,831
No, fuck you!
Fuck you!

735
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:22,707
FUCK yum
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

736
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:26,127
This is an undercover operation, guys.

737
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:27,795
Now, if this initial buy works out,

738
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,255
we're one step closer to Paulie.

739
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,007
Yeah, well, how do we
know this isn't a setup?

740
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:31,841
We don't.

741
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:33,885
Hey, he has brought us
closer than we've ever-

742
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,970
Oh, that's beautiful, Pope,
that's really beautiful.

743
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:36,929
Now you're on their side.

744
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,725
I'm siding with whoever
gets Walker off our asses!

745
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:41,684
Hey.

746
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,562
What's wrong with you guys?

747
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:45,563
-All right, all right, fuck it,

748
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:46,731
I don't give a shit.

749
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,149
Here, wear this.

750
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,027
Hey, I'm not wearing a wire.

751
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,112
Then you're not going in there at all!

752
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:55,031
We do this according to proper procedure

753
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,533
so that nobody walks on a technicality!

754
00:42:57,867 --> 00:43:01,162
And no innocent bystanders
get killed again!

755
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,289
We might as well close shop right now.

756
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,292
Where's the bullseye on this thing?

757
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,003
Be careful, partner.

758
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:11,714
-All right, let's watch him.

759
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,926
Then let's see what I'm buying.

760
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:30,608
This isn't what we agreed on.

761
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,861
Nandrolone decanoate.

762
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:35,905
Generic term for Deca-Durabolin.

763
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,490
Very good stuff.

764
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:39,992
At a bargain price, it
has Kevin the business man

765
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,036
kicking himself for being so generous.

766
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,247
I think I might have to start joining in

767
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,873
on some of that kickin'.

768
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:49,293
You sold me on a new human
growth hormone, not this shit.

769
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:54,423
Let's see how this one goes first.

770
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:57,885
A little trial run.

771
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,598
Satisfied?

772
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:05,977
Yeah.

773
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:11,315
-As a bonus, keep the car.

774
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,404
Neil the car collector thanks you.

775
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,240
Come on, one more, one more.

776
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:20,867
10!
Oh!

777
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:21,701
Great, good job, I got it.

778
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:22,994
Kim, you got a phone call, darling.

779
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:23,911
<i>Okay-</i>

780
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:25,163
You're a monster.

781
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:33,129
Excuse me.

782
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,214
-Ah.

783
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,508
We got off on the
wrong foot the other day.

784
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,051
I think it was my fault.

785
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,803
Oh, we agree on something.

786
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:43,598
Maybe I can take you to lunch,

787
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,433
we can get to know each other better.

788
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:50,062
You want to get to know me better?

789
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,314
Absolutely.

790
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:55,193
<i>Okay-</i>

791
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:02,366
Meet me here, tomorrow at 11.

792
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:05,703
Oh, and dress casual.

793
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:08,664
I'll be there.

794
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,668
I'm telling you, man,
this shit is the bomb.

795
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:14,837
You want to be in the NBA, right?

796
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:17,965
Yeah, I got 50, I got 100, I got 200.

797
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:18,799
What's up, what's up?

798
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,927
All right, that's my boy.

799
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,303
Hey, what's up, man?

800
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,193
Remember what I taught you?

801
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,027
Knees down.

802
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:38,861
Come on, one more time.

803
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:39,737
Now, remember what I taught you?

804
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:40,696
Yeah.

805
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:46,827
Hey, chill, man!

806
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:47,954
It's just a game.

807
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,421
Not bad for an old guy.

808
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:00,007
How about some one on one?

809
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:04,512
Yeah, go ahead.

810
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:11,310
Cone!

811
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,857
Good shot, good shot.

812
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:19,527
Let's go.

813
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:29,954
Oh...

814
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,082
Good shot.

815
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:34,125
Good game, man.

816
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,084
Good game.

817
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:40,965
So, I see you met my baby brother.

818
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,385
He taught me a few lessons.

819
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:45,344
Anytime, man.

820
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:47,138
I gotta run.
Okay.

821
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,472
See you later, Marla.
All right.

822
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:49,765
Home by 10, right?

823
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:51,851
Sure.

824
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,315
Lunch, he begged, as he
showed her his terrible injury.

825
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,360
Um, okay.

826
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:02,570
Give me 10 minutes?

827
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:06,615
You're right, Marla.

828
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,117
If Oscar keeps training like that,

829
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:10,703
he's got a real shot good
at a basketball scholarship.

830
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:12,830
Thanks.

831
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:18,544
You're a strange man, Mr. Farra.

832
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:20,046
Why, because I showed up?

833
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,964
No, I figured you'd show up.

834
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:23,799
Just wasn't sure you'd stay.

835
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:25,593
And that makes me strange?

836
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:28,054
No, that and letting
Oscar win at basketball.

837
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,015
What makes you think I let him win?

838
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:31,932
He's good.

839
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:34,894
For one thing, on the way in here,

840
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,729
you were limping on the wrong foot.

841
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:44,195
You know, you're a pretty
strange one yourself.

842
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,865
Professional trainer,
assistant manager at the gym,

843
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,327
volleyball teacher to inner-city youth.

844
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,873
A woman of many talents,
as well as many jobs.

845
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,918
Yeah, well, this one isn't a job.

846
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,629
I grew up in that neighborhood.

847
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:05,007
I used to play at that same rec center.

848
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:08,928
But I got lucky, I got
an athletic scholarship,

849
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:10,888
got an education.

850
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,100
Basically, I got a chance to be happy.

851
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,394
Maybe the same thing will happen

852
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,854
to some of the kids at the rec center.

853
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:20,272
Some.

854
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,607
Not enough.

855
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,859
You know, it's still early.

856
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:25,528
Maybe we can do something else.

857
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:27,696
Yeah, okay.

858
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,492
I know what we could do.

859
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:32,535
Come on, ladies.

860
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:33,869
They're ready for us.

861
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:34,829
Let's go.

862
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,510
These are the finalists in the contest.

863
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:33,846
Who's gonna win?

864
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:34,805
Uh...

865
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,224
It's too close to call.

866
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:42,104
If you see something
you like, by all means,

867
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:43,772
take your best shot.

868
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:46,942
I see something I like,

869
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:48,319
and I'm taking my best shot.

870
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,738
I just don't know if I'm getting anywhere.

871
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,949
You still looking for a trainer?

872
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,162
Could be, if it's the right one.

873
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:00,915
Tomorrow morning, 6:30.

874
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,376
I train hard, coach, you won't be sorry.

875
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,878
Yeah, you might.

876
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:11,550
Pain's my friend.

877
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,219
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

878
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:14,720
I'll see you in the morning.

879
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,430
<i>Okay-</i>

880
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,314
Hey, Frick and Frack.

881
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:27,274
What's going on here?

882
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:29,235
I'm at the vet getting my cat de-flead,

883
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:30,236
I get an urgent beep.

884
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:31,278
I don't get the catnip,

885
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,822
I'm gonna be scratching
my balls for months.

886
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,534
We tested the entire load.

887
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:38,160
So?

888
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:38,994
It was peanut oil.

889
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:39,828
What?

890
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:43,082
$50,000 worth of agency
funds down the drain.

891
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,750
Unless there's a law
against selling peanut oil

892
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:45,584
I don't know about.

893
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:48,170
Now, I'm gonna have to
check my Barney Fife manual,

894
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:50,172
but I think it's probably
gonna say we got screwed.

895
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:51,715
Hey, look, it's not
your life on the line,

896
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,133
it's Bend My Balls over here.

897
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:56,136
Hey, Walker's gonna nail
our asses to his office door

898
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,930
just as a warning to other agents

899
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:00,266
to stay the hell away from you two.

900
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,685
That is, if they can find you two again

901
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,895
after they reassign you to Guatemala.

902
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,189
Do you still got that Ford?

903
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:08,732
Fairlane?

904
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:09,692
Yeah?

905
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:10,651
Perfect.

906
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:17,199
What the hell are they doing?

907
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:18,867
I don't fuckin' know.

908
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:22,788
What are you doing?

909
00:52:04,163 --> 00:52:06,373
Hey, what are you doin'?

910
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:07,916
What is that?

911
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:08,959
What the...

912
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,086
What is that?

913
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:15,132
I want my money.

914
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:18,427
Okay, okay.

915
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:21,347
I'll set it up, okay?

916
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,723
I'll set it up.

917
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:26,060
Catch.

918
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,402
He's trouble.

919
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:38,322
I don't know, if somebody
sold me a load of bad shit,

920
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:39,406
I'd be trouble too.

921
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,327
So this is the guy, huh?

922
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,287
The peanut oil lord of L.A.

923
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,375
Nice shoes.

924
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:50,334
Comfortable?

925
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:53,128
Not to a guy whose ass
I'm kicking with them.

926
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:55,547
Yeah, yeah, I heard that about you,

927
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:56,674
a regular Bruce Lee.

928
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,218
Better than making drug buys.

929
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,178
You got my money or not?

930
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:02,888
Chill, brother, chill.

931
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,824
Come on, huh, what is that about?

932
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,283
You don't trust me?

933
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,292
I tell you what...

934
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,211
Why don't we just forget
what happened, huh?

935
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:35,796
I got all the stuff you'll ever need.

936
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:38,674
Human growth hormones, primobolan depot,

937
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,968
Winston tabs, all that kind of stuff.

938
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:45,639
I mean, you and I can make
some serious cash together.

939
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:47,057
That's a bold statement.

940
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,059
You interested?

941
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,150
Could be.

942
00:53:58,527 --> 00:53:59,778
Deal goes down my way.

943
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:01,613
-All right, let me hear it.

944
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:06,869
You front me the entire load.

945
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,415
If it checks out, you get paid.

946
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:16,086
You must be dreamin'.

947
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:22,509
I tell you what.

948
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:25,846
When you come back to reality,

949
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:28,849
you give me a call, you hear?

950
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,064
You check him out, huh?

951
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:38,192
Call Frankie in Las Vegas.

952
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:39,318
You have somebody lean on Frankie,

953
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,528
make sure we get the
whole truth, all right?

954
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:43,280
And what's this thing about?

955
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:44,740
What's the deal with Keko?

956
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:47,743
He's meeting us tonight
to pick up more product.

957
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:48,702
What are you talking about?

958
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,205
He has much more character on NYPD Blue.

959
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,123
Like that whole tropical
fish hobby of his,

960
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:54,958
and he's got a sexy woman in his life.

961
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:55,793
What about the-

962
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:56,627
In that old show,
all he did was hang out

963
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,461
with all those-

964
00:54:57,795 --> 00:54:58,462
What about the David Caruso thing?

965
00:54:58,796 --> 00:54:59,963
What are you talking about David Caruso?

966
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,089
David Caruso.

967
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:02,049
What is this?

968
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,552
Holy shit.

969
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:08,847
That son of a bitch, he did it.

970
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,143
We're back in business!

971
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:14,311
Ladies and gentlemen,

972
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:15,813
here's the moment we've been waiting for.

973
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,732
The finals of the men's
physique championship.

974
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:21,109
These guys are really
primed and ready to go.

975
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,779
Here we see Glenn Castle,
one of the favorites,

976
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,323
showing his tremendous
muscle mass and size.

977
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:28,325
I don't think I've ever
seen him look better.

978
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,410
We have Claude Groux from
Canada in the middle,

979
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:31,662
and Aaron Baker on the left.

980
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,163
You know, the bodybuilders are hitting

981
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:34,373
their strong points now,

982
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:37,501
showing the muscularity, the
hardness, and the separation-

983
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:38,544
How's Kim?

984
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:39,378
Nervous.

985
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:42,172
The men are almost done, and
she's first up for the women.

986
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,633
Glenn looks great.

987
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:46,593
Yeah, he's worked really hard.

988
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:48,720
I know.

989
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:51,390
It's still pretty hard
to do on protein shakes

990
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:52,850
and skinless chicken alone.

991
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:55,143
You know what?

992
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:55,978
I've gotta check on Kim.

993
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:56,937
The judges really have

994
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:58,856
their work cut out for them.

995
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,066
It's a great competition.

996
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:11,493
Welcome home, Neil.

997
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:14,413
Let's take a ride.

998
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,917
Yo, Neil, I want to thank you

999
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:21,295
for accepting my invitation
to come to this party.

1000
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,840
My nephew here, he wanted
to give a masquerade party,

1001
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:25,924
and I said, hey, I mean,

1002
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:27,843
there's a lot of people in this business

1003
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,345
walking around with some kind of mask on.

1004
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:32,264
So I said hey, it would be cool

1005
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:35,475
to give an anti-masquerade party,

1006
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,061
so we could peel off some of those masks.

1007
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:39,062
Know what I mean?

1008
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,024
I thought we were done doing business.

1009
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,066
Yo, Sonny.

1010
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,067
Yeah.

1011
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,736
Hey, Uncle Paulie.

1012
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,113
I mean, Paulie, he's here.

1013
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:51,116
Right on time.

1014
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:55,454
Now, the party can begin.

1015
00:56:58,165 --> 00:56:59,583
You want me to come with you?

1016
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,960
Nah, man, I just gotta
pick up the shit from fat boy

1017
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:04,212
and his queer nephew.

1018
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:05,297
Aight.

1019
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:07,007
It's all good, just chill.

1020
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:08,759
Besides, he don't like too many witnesses

1021
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,886
when he's doing business,
if you know what I mean.

1022
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:11,845
Right.

1023
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:14,514
Ay, yo, what up mang!

1024
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,016
Keko in the house.

1025
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:19,311
Ay, what up, Sonny?

1026
00:57:19,645 --> 00:57:21,021
How you doin', man?

1027
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,733
Hey, watch the finger!

1028
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:25,609
How you feelin', man?

1029
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:26,443
Good to see you.

1030
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:27,819
Hey-

1031
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:32,407
Listen, I want you to help
me understand something.

1032
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,535
I mean, I fronted you 300 thou

1033
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,871
of the best steroids on the planet,

1034
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:40,207
and after working six weeks,

1035
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:43,043
you bring me back 47 grand.

1036
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:43,877
Hey, man.

1037
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:45,671
I've been busting my fucking ass

1038
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,714
putting your shit on the streets, man.

1039
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:48,799
My ass.

1040
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:49,758
You know what?

1041
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:51,051
I'm trying to tell you, man,

1042
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:52,928
you can't move this product too fast.

1043
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:56,139
The DEA is gonna be up my fuckin' ass.

1044
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,141
And you know what, Paulie?

1045
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,103
Then they're gonna be up your ass.

1046
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:03,480
Know what I'm saying?

1047
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,775
Tell me something, Neil.

1048
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:08,860
What Keko is running down to
me, is that the real deal?

1049
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,862
Are they gonna be up my ass?

1050
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:12,364
Not if you know what you're doing.

1051
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:14,032
Who is this fuckin' asshole?

1052
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:18,787
Oh, he's a job applicant,
an executive in training.

1053
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:21,748
But back...

1054
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,711
To me and you.

1055
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:28,630
Are you telling me that
business is going to get better?

1056
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,841
Absolutely, Paulie.

1057
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:31,675
Guaranteed.

1058
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:33,301
You know me, it's all good.

1059
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:34,845
Yeah, I know, man.

1060
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:35,679
Yeah.

1061
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:38,682
You know the problem with you, amigo,

1062
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,601
is that you're always looking for a way

1063
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:45,480
to get back at whitey
for stealing your land.

1064
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:50,193
I mean, hey, that's just
flat out racism, man.

1065
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,612
You can't live your life doing that.

1066
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,114
You know what I'm saying?

1067
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:56,616
I mean, think about-

1068
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,035
Hey, if you fuckin' want your faggoty

1069
00:58:58,368 --> 00:58:59,244
little wannabe nephew to live,

1070
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:00,912
you better back the fuck up.

1071
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:02,956
Back the fuck up!

1072
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:04,499
You know what the problem
is with you, Paulie?

1073
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:05,667
You think 'cause I ain't a brother, man,

1074
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,377
I don't know what's up, man,

1075
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,129
I don't know what time it is.

1076
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:11,006
What time is it now, brother?

1077
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,633
Keko, Keko.

1078
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,178
You disappoint me, man.

1079
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:18,305
Jesus, I thought you
were smarter than that.

1080
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:24,770
I'm shot!

1081
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:25,729
Oh my God!

1082
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,482
Sonny, man, damn it.

1083
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:31,777
Hey, fuck, Paulie, man.

1084
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:32,694
Come on, Paulie, man!

1085
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:34,196
We've been doing good business together!

1086
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:35,906
Paulie, man, I'll be better next time.

1087
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,115
You shot me!

1088
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:42,579
Sonny, how many times did I tell you

1089
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:44,372
not to stand so close to a mark, huh?

1090
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:45,415
You're right, I'm sorry-

1091
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:46,666
Man, shut up!

1092
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,543
And stop all this goddamn whimpering!

1093
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,261
Keko, Keko.

1094
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:01,306
Look, amigo.

1095
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,768
If you want to sink your
teeth into another taco...

1096
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,563
I made 200 grand, man, the first month,

1097
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:10,357
but I put it back on the street in loans.

1098
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,442
I swear, Paulie, I swear.

1099
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:15,028
So what you're telling me is
that while you're stalling me

1100
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:17,739
you're making all this
interest on my money, right?

1101
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:19,991
Sonny.

1102
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:20,826
What?

1103
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,327
Listen up here, you
might learn something.

1104
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:24,746
This is one smart hombre.

1105
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,165
Please, Paulie, I got
all of it back, man.

1106
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:28,708
But the interest's for you, man.

1107
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,210
You and me, man.

1108
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:31,044
Yeah?

1109
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,340
Hold that thought.

1110
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:40,011
Yeah?

1111
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:40,971
Uh huh.

1112
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:43,181
Jimmy Snake-Eyes.

1113
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:45,976
He just finished his chat with Frankie.

1114
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:50,063
Yo, Jimmy, what's up?

1115
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:53,859
You find out what I wanted to know about

1116
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:55,944
this guy Neil Farra?

1117
01:00:58,238 --> 01:00:58,989
Oh, yeah?

1118
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:02,242
Huh.

1119
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:05,412
Yeah, that's cool.

1120
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:07,914
All right, later.

1121
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:32,314
Keko, Keko.

1122
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:43,700
Keko, where's my cash?

1123
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:45,035
My lady's got it, man.

1124
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,204
I swear, Paulie.

1125
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:48,205
Oh, yeah?

1126
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:49,039
Yeah, man.

1127
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,540
It's all good, man.

1128
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:55,420
Those are nice shoes,
man, what size are they?

1129
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:57,797
-10.

1130
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:01,551
Are they comfortable?

1131
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:02,552
No, Paulie!

1132
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:31,706
Let me tell you something
personal about me.

1133
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:36,795
Why I'm so curious all
the time about shoes.

1134
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,838
Man, I have a problem with my feet.

1135
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,341
It's a bitch to find comfortable shoes.

1136
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:44,052
You know, when I was 10,

1137
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:47,889
my folks took me to the Bronx Zoo,

1138
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:49,808
where they had this pony ride.

1139
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:51,601
But I didn't want to
see no funky pony, man,

1140
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:53,728
I was afraid of the damn thing.

1141
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:56,648
Well, to make a long story short,

1142
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,401
the goddamn pony steps on my foot, man,

1143
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:00,235
breaks every bone.

1144
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:02,320
It's like applesauce.

1145
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:06,950
You know, I limped for
one God damn year, man.

1146
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,163
And that's why I have
trouble with my feet,

1147
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,459
'cause I have to have
my shoes special made

1148
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,713
right here in L.A. by Mario Renaldi.

1149
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,134
Looks like we got an
opening in our organization.

1150
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:26,303
Are you interested?

1151
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:29,597
Sure.

1152
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:33,143
Welcome to the family.

1153
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,479
Go take care of his buddies.

1154
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:41,484
Take Sonny to the doctor, all right?

1155
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:44,487
Aw, geez!

1156
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:02,964
All right.

1157
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:05,008
This is where it's gonna
come down, partner.

1158
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:07,719
Tomorrow you bring me back my 50 thou,

1159
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:09,012
I give you the real stuff,

1160
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:11,306
you move it all within one week,

1161
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:12,349
and I give you a bigger load.

1162
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:13,516
Deal?

1163
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:17,604
For something this big,

1164
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:19,481
I'm gonna have to bring in my partner.

1165
01:04:21,733 --> 01:04:22,442
Partner?

1166
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:26,613
It's cool, man.

1167
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,198
Frankie told me all about it.

1168
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,657
No problem, no problem.

1169
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:36,790
Can I get you a drink?

1170
01:04:41,086 --> 01:04:43,046
I let something happen tonight.

1171
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:47,509
Something that shouldn't have.

1172
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:51,137
What?

1173
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:52,472
I can't tell you.

1174
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:03,358
You come over here obviously upset,

1175
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,528
but you won't let me help you?

1176
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:10,240
That's not fair, Neil.

1177
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:11,991
I know.

1178
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,834
Could you have done anything to stop it?

1179
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:26,840
No.

1180
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:33,596
Then give yourself a break.

1181
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:55,827
You confuse me.

1182
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,956
I know you've been meeting
with that Paulie guy,

1183
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:03,376
and I know what kind of man he is.

1184
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:09,924
Maybe if it was just me, I wouldn't care,

1185
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:11,259
but Oscar's involved.

1186
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:14,012
He likes you too.

1187
01:06:16,014 --> 01:06:17,974
I won't take any chances with his future.

1188
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:24,939
I would never do anything to hurt Oscar.

1189
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:30,695
I'm not some crook who's
out to make a quick score

1190
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:31,863
and blow town.

1191
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:36,242
You gotta trust me and
believe me when I tell you.

1192
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:39,829
Paulie's gonna regret we ever met.

1193
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,290
Okay, I'll accept that, Neil.

1194
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:48,755
For now.

1195
01:07:02,894 --> 01:07:03,520
Hey, look!

1196
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,813
Hey, Dino, what are you doing over here?

1197
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:06,731
Hey!
Hey, Dave.

1198
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:07,565
Say hello.

1199
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:09,067
Hey, say hello to my friend Neil.

1200
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:09,901
Hey, Neil.

1201
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:11,194
I'll see you later, all right?

1202
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:12,070
You take care of yourself,

1203
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:13,863
say hello to the family.

1204
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:32,715
Yeah, that's cool,

1205
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:35,969
but it doesn't always
come down that way, man.

1206
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:39,389
I mean, some chick and
some dude, they meet,

1207
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:40,640
they hook up, they make a deal

1208
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:44,143
to go make whoopee in a
hotel, they get busted.

1209
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:45,937
Take the same chick, same dude,

1210
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:47,272
they make a deal, they make whoopee,

1211
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,857
but this time, they do
it in front of a camera.

1212
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:51,568
Somehow, it's legal.

1213
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:52,443
I mean, not only that,

1214
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:55,154
but they start a whole new organization.

1215
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:56,239
What's with that, man?

1216
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:59,033
Why's one legal and one ain't?

1217
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:00,159
I'll tell you why.

1218
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:04,872
'Cause most wives would
rather have their men

1219
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:06,666
beating off to dirty pictures

1220
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,419
than banging the local whore
at the neighborhood bar.

1221
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:13,298
Excuse me, but actually
I believe the difference is

1222
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:15,717
is that pornography is a product,

1223
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:17,802
prostitution is a service.

1224
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:20,096
It's easier to test a product.

1225
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,889
Since when did you get so smart?

1226
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,393
I think he just
reads a lot of dirty books.

1227
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,352
Hey, Uncle Paulie,

1228
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:27,353
you gonna let these two
talk to me like that?

1229
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:28,521
Come on!

1230
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:29,981
Oh, come on.

1231
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:30,815
If it wasn't for the whores,

1232
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:32,984
you'd be engaged to your right hand.

1233
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:03,908
I owe you.

1234
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:05,743
You guys clear out.

1235
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:07,829
I'll take it from here.

1236
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:11,249
Check and see if anymore
idiots are out there.

1237
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:14,460
Stand up.

1238
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:34,564
Tiny, take the shot.

1239
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,025
Why can't I play?

1240
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:38,985
Why?

1241
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:41,904
'Cause you need fingers.

1242
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:48,995
Hey, that was a class act
you did last night, my man.

1243
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:50,621
Just protecting my investment.

1244
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:52,165
Yeah, but now you
don't have to look over

1245
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,959
your shoulder anymore for Mondo.

1246
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:56,127
In this business, you always gotta

1247
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:57,170
look over your shoulder.

1248
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,505
Yeah, that's a fact, but with Mondo,

1249
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,631
at least you knew where you stood,

1250
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:02,091
it was all business.

1251
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:03,718
But with cops, nah, man,

1252
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:05,094
that's a whole 'nother thing.

1253
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,096
These guys walk around like tough guys,

1254
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:08,973
kissing politicians ass,

1255
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:09,932
trying to get them elected,

1256
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,809
telling them I'm the bad guy.

1257
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:13,060
You know, like Bush, man.

1258
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:13,895
What is it with this guy?

1259
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:15,062
What makes him such a great guy?

1260
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:17,857
He goes into Panama,
he kicks Noriega's ass,

1261
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:19,650
even after doing business with him

1262
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:21,194
for all those many years.

1263
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:22,695
What does he do next?

1264
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:25,156
Send troops into Iraq to kick Saddam's ass

1265
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:28,159
for cutting off our Jones for oil.

1266
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:30,620
I mean, hey man, I do the same thing,

1267
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:33,456
they send feds and snitches after me.

1268
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,625
I mean, what's that all about?

1269
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:36,918
Am I so bad?

1270
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:40,505
Hey, but look, man.

1271
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:44,091
I get a little philosophical
at times, it's cool.

1272
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:46,469
We better be goin'.

1273
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:54,185
Man, that Paulie digs is somethin'.

1274
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:55,728
Man knows how to flip the script.

1275
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:57,230
Did you see that jacuzzi?

1276
01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:00,149
That shit is phat, p-h-a-t!

1277
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:01,692
What is it with you?

1278
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:03,277
What are you talking about?

1279
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:05,696
The clothes, the cash.

1280
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:07,156
What's up with all of this?

1281
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:11,202
The Alfano Case last year, remember?

1282
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:12,495
We worked on it for five months,

1283
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:14,455
nearly got whacked twice?

1284
01:12:14,789 --> 01:12:17,917
I mean, we take down a hit
guy that kills 8 people,

1285
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:19,293
two of them kids.

1286
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:20,878
And we take them down good.

1287
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:22,755
We think old sparky's
riding straight to hell,

1288
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:26,342
but no, the FBI steps
in, witness protection...

1289
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,471
I mean, he gets a new life to
roll over on somebody else.

1290
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:31,305
And what do we get?

1291
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:32,139
Nothing.

1292
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:33,349
Just a bunch of shit.

1293
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:34,976
So?

1294
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:35,810
It wasn't the first time.

1295
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:37,103
Yeah, that's my point, Neil,

1296
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:38,813
it wasn't the first time.

1297
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:41,399
It happens before, and
it's gonna happen again.

1298
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:44,110
So when we go back to
search for more evidence,

1299
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:46,070
I find some cash in envelopes.

1300
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:47,989
How much?

1301
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:51,284
How much!

1302
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:53,494
250,000 okay?

1303
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:54,871
Hey, I thought you knew about it

1304
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,081
and just didn't wanna say anything.

1305
01:12:57,415 --> 01:12:59,792
I kept your piece aside
in a safety deposit box.

1306
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,545
I figured at the right
time you'd come to me.

1307
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:03,546
That's bullshit!

1308
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,881
How could you do that?

1309
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:05,715
How?

1310
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:07,842
Remember the bullet I took
in my hand, remember that?

1311
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:09,844
I hold my hand like this for 10 seconds,

1312
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:11,929
I start shaking like a 90 year old lady.

1313
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:14,056
If the boss finds out, I'm out of a job.

1314
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,558
It'll get better.

1315
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:17,602
No, doc says it could only get worse.

1316
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:20,313
I'm lucky I can still hold
my own click to take a piss.

1317
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:22,523
I'm glad I took that fuckin' money, okay?

1318
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:23,858
And if any shit comes down,

1319
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:25,401
you got nothing to do with it.

1320
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:26,527
That's not the point!

1321
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:27,695
Well, what is the point?

1322
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:29,155
The point is, there's a line between

1323
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:31,782
the good guys and the bad guys.

1324
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:33,659
Sure, we pretend to cross that line,

1325
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:35,661
but that was make believe.

1326
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:36,495
Now it's real.

1327
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:37,997
Hey, don't start that
self righteous bullshit

1328
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:38,998
with me, okay?

1329
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:39,832
When that little girl took a bullet,

1330
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,168
were you standing on
the side of the angels?

1331
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:47,465
Wait, look, Neil, that
was a cheap shot, I know.

1332
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:49,550
Forget it, let's get
the hell out of here.

1333
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,114
I got good news for you, boss.

1334
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:12,949
Oh, yeah?

1335
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:13,908
What's that?

1336
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:18,454
That was fast.

1337
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:19,705
Our new boys?

1338
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,000
They want the next one to be a big one.

1339
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:24,752
HOW big?

1340
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:28,589
Two million.

1341
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:29,507
Two million.

1342
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:34,470
Yeah, yeah, that is big.

1343
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:36,973
Anything that size, I
better be on it myself.

1344
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,684
When can I get the cash?

1345
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:40,935
They got it now.

1346
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:51,946
Look, I'm sorry about-

1347
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:52,780
Forget it.

1348
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:53,864
I was out of line, you know?

1349
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:55,241
It's none of my business.

1350
01:14:55,574 --> 01:14:56,742
What are you talking
about none of your business?

1351
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:59,036
If I was caught, they
would automatically assume

1352
01:14:59,370 --> 01:14:59,996
you had something to do with it.

1353
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,373
I mean, are you that stupid that I gotta

1354
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:04,125
figure out everything for you?

1355
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:05,334
Yeah, I guess I am.

1356
01:15:07,795 --> 01:15:10,589
-All right, well, I got a little gift.

1357
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:15,052
Koima Recreational Center for Kids.

1358
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:19,765
All right?

1359
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:21,934
Now, is everything cool with us?

1360
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:23,102
We're cool.

1361
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:23,936
All right.

1362
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:24,895
How's your hand?

1363
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:27,064
The one I got shot in is not too good,

1364
01:15:27,398 --> 01:15:28,024
but this one?

1365
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:29,567
Better than both my wives.

1366
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,028
You're disgusting, you know that?

1367
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:36,323
A lot of people tell me that!

1368
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:50,087
So, who set up the picnic brunch?

1369
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:53,507
I hope this isn't a request
for more money, De Marco.

1370
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:57,053
We don't need more
money, I need your help.

1371
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:58,095
Paulie's ready for the big one,

1372
01:15:58,429 --> 01:15:59,805
we're gonna be moving
fast from here on out.

1373
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:00,765
Meaning?

1374
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:03,267
I need more wiretaps.

1375
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:04,560
Sure.

1376
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:07,563
We can probably get you
more wiretaps by tomorrow.

1377
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:08,647
Too late.

1378
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:10,274
By then, this whole thing could be over.

1379
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:11,525
Look, De Marco.

1380
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:13,069
Without a court order, anything we heard

1381
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:14,111
we couldn't use anyway.

1382
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:16,655
We won't need it, we'll have
enough evidence without it.

1383
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:18,991
Why don't we just bring
him in for murdering Keko?

1384
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:20,493
You're a witness.

1385
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:21,327
No good.

1386
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:22,703
My word against theirs.

1387
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:24,080
My bet is, there's no body,

1388
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,165
and a half a dozen witnesses that'll swear

1389
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:28,000
he's in Mexico visiting his family.

1390
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:29,251
Why don't you just do what the fuck

1391
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:30,419
he's telling you to do?

1392
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:31,837
Well, I'm sorry, but we're not gonna

1393
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:32,671
commit a felony for you.

1394
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:35,174
So, how else do you want
to proceed with the case?

1395
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:38,677
What case?

1396
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:43,265
Fuckin' jerkoffs.

1397
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:46,894
What?

1398
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:49,105
Nothin'.

1399
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:53,400
Damn!

1400
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,778
Hey, lady, need a lift?

1401
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,948
Damn thing won't start again!

1402
01:16:59,281 --> 01:16:59,990
How many times do I have to take it

1403
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:02,284
to the goddamn shop!

1404
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:03,911
Relax, Marla!

1405
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:05,371
I'll call a tow truck.

1406
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:07,206
Come on, I'll give you a ride.

1407
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:15,923
What's wrong, Marla?

1408
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:16,882
Nothing.

1409
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:19,885
This can't be about the car.

1410
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:26,517
I found these in Oscar's bedroom.

1411
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:30,229
They were hidden in his basketball shoes.

1412
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:35,693
I'll take care of it.

1413
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:45,035
Most the kids
on the team are taking it.

1414
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:48,205
Look.

1415
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:50,583
I'm not saying steroids are poison,

1416
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:51,876
but they're illegal and dangerous.

1417
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:53,544
And you know, there are other ways,

1418
01:17:53,878 --> 01:17:58,591
other ways that won't break Marla's heart.

1419
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:02,386
What do you want me to do, huh?

1420
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:03,512
I got a dream.

1421
01:18:04,555 --> 01:18:07,016
I want you to figure out
what's really important.

1422
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:09,560
When you do, let me know.

1423
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:39,423
Can you get rid of these for me?

1424
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:46,597
I see you're still with Neil.

1425
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:52,353
I don't know, there's just
something sneaky about that guy.

1426
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:55,898
I mean, yesterday, I see
him going to Kevin's office

1427
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:57,441
with a briefcase in his hand,

1428
01:18:58,609 --> 01:19:00,569
and when he leaves, he's not carrying it.

1429
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:02,738
You know what, Kim?

1430
01:19:03,072 --> 01:19:05,574
I appreciate the concern, I really do.

1431
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:08,202
Everything's fine.

1432
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:13,040
Yeah, I know he has secrets,

1433
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:14,792
but he swore to me

1434
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:17,419
he has nothing to do
with anything illegal,

1435
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:20,798
and he's gonna prove it
to me tomorrow night.

1436
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,634
So, there you have it.

1437
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:25,636
Satisfied?

1438
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:30,307
How's it going?

1439
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:31,684
We're in.

1440
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:33,602
How does it feel to break the law?

1441
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:35,396
Too damn good.

1442
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:40,025
I hear you boys are pretty ambitious.

1443
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:43,404
I think we're proven
for more than just talk.

1444
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:46,282
Yeah, that you did, that you did.

1445
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,409
But moving 50 grand worth
of stuff is one thing,

1446
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:51,161
moving two million is a
whole 'nother ballgame.

1447
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:53,038
Difference between college
and professional football,

1448
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:55,416
are you boys ready for the pros?

1449
01:19:57,167 --> 01:19:58,794
Hey, Neil, do you believe this guy?

1450
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:01,964
We don't need no pep talk, we are pros.

1451
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:03,799
All right, that's cool.

1452
01:20:10,264 --> 01:20:11,307
Let's make a deal.

1453
01:20:12,516 --> 01:20:15,019
How fast can you get the two million cash?

1454
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:19,398
Tomorrow.

1455
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:21,400
D'ah.

1456
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:24,236
Yeah, right.

1457
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:25,487
That fast, huh?

1458
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,197
Yeah, that fast.

1459
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:28,824
We got some backers that
are pretty impressed

1460
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:30,326
with our sales potential.

1461
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:31,618
It's their cash.

1462
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:35,414
Well, I don't care whose it is today,

1463
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:37,541
as long as it's mine tomorrow.

1464
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:38,751
I tell you what...

1465
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:41,754
Once you get the cash in
hand, you give me a call,

1466
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:42,921
then I'll tell you the warehouse

1467
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:45,549
where the product is located, okay?

1468
01:20:45,883 --> 01:20:46,383
Good enough.

1469
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:50,179
My man, bring your own truck.

1470
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:53,807
I don't get it.

1471
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:57,311
I mean, Marla's my friend.

1472
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:58,520
Mhm.

1473
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:01,440
I was just trying to help
her out, and she blows me off.

1474
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,192
Yeah.

1475
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:05,527
Well, she can do worse
than a guy like Neil.

1476
01:21:07,321 --> 01:21:08,072
Hm.

1477
01:21:09,323 --> 01:21:11,867
Marla's not cut out
for the dangerous type.

1478
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:14,578
And you are?

1479
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:19,083
Yes, I am.

1480
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:23,545
Ah, does that mean
that what's yours is mine

1481
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:25,381
and what's mine is mine, right?

1482
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:27,758
See?

1483
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:29,301
At least with you-
Yeah.

1484
01:21:29,635 --> 01:21:30,636
I know who you are and what you do.

1485
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:31,804
Yeah, right.

1486
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:33,389
But this Neil-
Mhm.

1487
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:35,724
I mean, he's just lying to her.

1488
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:37,309
Yeah.

1489
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:39,645
Swears he's not into anything illegal.

1490
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:42,064
Says he's gonna prove it
to her tomorrow night.

1491
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:49,571
Wanna run that by me one more time?

1492
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:52,116
Says that he's not into anything illegal

1493
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:56,161
and he's gonna prove it
to her tomorrow night.

1494
01:21:58,372 --> 01:21:59,706
Tomorrow night?

1495
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:08,424
Kevin!

1496
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:10,259
What's up?

1497
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:12,344
There's something fishy about Neil.

1498
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:15,889
I knew it.

1499
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:18,600
He's a cop.

1500
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:22,688
Now what?

1501
01:22:25,732 --> 01:22:26,692
Payback time.

1502
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:30,279
Oh, can't we just be
couch potatoes all day?

1503
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:31,280
I wish.

1504
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,949
What's the matter?
I can't reach my shoe.

1505
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:35,534
Thank you.

1506
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:36,952
Oh, that's him.
Aw!

1507
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:39,163
<i>|</i> gotta go-

1508
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:40,330
I'll see you tonight.

1509
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:43,625
Tonight all secrets
will be revealed, right?

1510
01:22:44,877 --> 01:22:47,129
I made reservations at Chez Jay's.

1511
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:54,887
Oh, hang on, I'll go with you.

1512
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:57,097
I gotta run to the store
and get more coffee.

1513
01:22:57,431 --> 01:22:58,807
I didn't realize what a
caffeine fiend you are.

1514
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:00,434
Great, you can meet Dave.

1515
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:07,232
Hi.
Hey.

1516
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:08,942
Dave, Marla.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1517
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:09,776
Nice to meet you.

1518
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:10,611
Nice to meet you, how you doin'?

1519
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:12,362
Good, thanks.

1520
01:23:12,696 --> 01:23:13,739
I hate him now, you know why?

1521
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:15,115
'Cause I'm not him.

1522
01:23:16,283 --> 01:23:18,702
Ancl you're exactly like
Neil told me you were.

1523
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:19,828
I know, handsome.
Yeah.

1524
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:23,207
Okay, can I have the keys?

1525
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:24,500
Oh, yeah, sorry.

1526
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:28,337
Jaguar!

1527
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:29,838
Bye.

1528
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:30,672
Bye.

1529
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:32,007
Nice meeting you.

1530
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:42,893
She is fantastic.

1531
01:24:12,673 --> 01:24:14,258
Hey, Uncle Paulie,
shouldn't we just leave it?

1532
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:15,884
I mean, what if the cops are there?

1533
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:18,387
Listen.

1534
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,097
I'm not leaving two million bucks behind,

1535
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:21,139
I'd rather leave you behind.

1536
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:22,349
Now, let's get out of here.

1537
01:24:22,683 --> 01:24:23,934
You cannot barge in
there without a warrant.

1538
01:24:24,268 --> 01:24:25,519
Even if you arrest them, they'll go free!

1539
01:24:25,852 --> 01:24:28,397
Who said anything
about arresting anybody?

1540
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:30,065
Oh, that's beautiful, vigilantes.

1541
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:31,817
Well, if you kill somebody,
you're gonna go to jail.

1542
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:34,987
And Pope and I are gonna testify
against you, right, Pope?

1543
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:36,154
I don't know.

1544
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:38,740
Oh, man.

1545
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:39,575
Look.

1546
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:40,492
I understand your position on this.

1547
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:43,704
If I was in your shoes,
I'd do the same damn thing.

1548
01:24:44,037 --> 01:24:44,788
Just tell Walker what happened,

1549
01:24:45,122 --> 01:24:46,415
I'll back up whatever you say.

1550
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:51,878
Oh, goddamn it!

1551
01:24:52,212 --> 01:24:53,547
Stop!

1552
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:54,881
Shit.

1553
01:24:55,215 --> 01:24:57,175
If you're gonna do this, do it right.

1554
01:24:58,218 --> 01:24:59,386
All right, you wanna play?

1555
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:00,929
We're gonna play.

1556
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:05,183
Here, you take that.

1557
01:25:06,727 --> 01:25:07,853
Got some more bullets?

1558
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:09,688
Do you want bullets too?

1559
01:25:10,022 --> 01:25:10,939
Here.

1560
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:12,733
Here, you take this.

1561
01:25:15,569 --> 01:25:17,070
There, you take that.

1562
01:25:18,405 --> 01:25:20,365
Here, take that.

1563
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:22,409
I'm gonna take this.

1564
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:23,452
Where do we start?

1565
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:26,371
You three take Paulie's house.

1566
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:27,456
Kevin's mine.

1567
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:30,083
No, no, no, you can't do this one alone.

1568
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:32,044
This one I can.

1569
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:14,961
There's nobody here.

1570
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:15,879
I know there's nobody here.

1571
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:17,964
If there was somebody
here, they'd be dead now.

1572
01:26:18,298 --> 01:26:19,758
All right, let's get outta here.

1573
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:20,967
Let's go, horse meat.

1574
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:43,198
Hey, Jack!

1575
01:26:44,908 --> 01:26:48,078
Hey, Jack, where the hell are you, man?

1576
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:51,498
Son of a bitch.

1577
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,146
Come on!

1578
01:27:57,355 --> 01:27:58,482
Right here.

1579
01:28:07,574 --> 01:28:09,159
Come on, little man.

1580
01:28:09,493 --> 01:28:10,702
You're all out of tricks now.

1581
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:29,971
Where's Paulie?

1582
01:28:33,475 --> 01:28:35,268
Dave and I will go in
through the loading clocks,

1583
01:28:35,602 --> 01:28:36,645
you guys go around back.

1584
01:28:58,708 --> 01:28:59,543
Go 'head.

1585
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:22,816
Go, let's go!

1586
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:04,334
They got us pinned down.

1587
01:31:04,668 --> 01:31:06,086
You got any ideas?

1588
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:09,005
Well, I think we should call for backup.

1589
01:31:28,525 --> 01:31:29,526
Some cop!

1590
01:31:41,204 --> 01:31:43,999
You know, I'm glad it
wasn't you in that car.

1591
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:45,625
Now I get to do it personally.

1592
01:32:01,016 --> 01:32:01,766
Shit.

1593
01:32:04,728 --> 01:32:06,604
You know, you're pretty slippery.

1594
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:07,897
You know that?

1595
01:32:08,231 --> 01:32:09,899
Come on, get some of this, huh?

1596
01:32:10,233 --> 01:32:11,109
Come on.

1597
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:12,277
All right.

1598
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:14,029
You can do this.

1599
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:14,904
You can do this.

1600
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:15,947
Show me something.

1601
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:16,865
That ain't shit.

1602
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:19,617
Show me something, show me something, huh?

1603
01:32:27,625 --> 01:32:29,919
Oh, man, this shit stinks.

1604
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:31,588
Let's get out of here.

1605
01:33:52,794 --> 01:33:53,545
Get up!

1606
01:33:57,715 --> 01:33:58,716
This one's for Marla.

1607
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:12,522
Throw me the gun!

1608
01:34:15,024 --> 01:34:16,860
Throw me the God damn gun!

1609
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:30,123
Nice shoes.

1610
01:34:30,456 --> 01:34:31,082
Comfortable?

1611
01:34:32,041 --> 01:34:32,792
Goodbye.

1612
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:38,381
You're supposed to
learn from your mistakes.

1613
01:34:38,715 --> 01:34:40,049
Isn't that right, Uncle Paulie?

1614
01:34:41,134 --> 01:34:42,302
God damn you, Sonny.

1615
01:34:53,062 --> 01:34:53,855
Come on, I got you.

1616
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:54,814
I got you.

1617
01:35:00,612 --> 01:35:01,779
You guys all right?

1618
01:35:02,822 --> 01:35:03,698
We're fine.

1619
01:35:04,032 --> 01:35:06,242
You check for survivors, we'll
go downstairs for Paulie.

1620
01:35:06,576 --> 01:35:07,952
I'm calling for backup.

1621
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:11,372
This fuckin' guy.

1622
01:35:14,417 --> 01:35:15,084
I don't know.

1623
01:35:15,418 --> 01:35:16,252
They look dead to me.

1624
01:35:19,464 --> 01:35:20,340
This one's alive.

1625
01:35:23,009 --> 01:35:24,969
Come here, you piece of shit.

1626
01:35:25,303 --> 01:35:27,180
There's a lot of money here.

1627
01:35:27,513 --> 01:35:28,014
How much?

1628
01:35:28,348 --> 01:35:31,392
We're not talking
about 250 grand anymore.

1629
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:34,646
It's gotta be close to
a million dollars here.

1630
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:37,774
We're talking about
retirement in the Bahamas.

1631
01:35:38,107 --> 01:35:40,443
No more Walkers, no more Paulies.

1632
01:35:40,777 --> 01:35:43,780
Every time my hand shakes,
I can just lift a martini.

1633
01:35:44,113 --> 01:35:45,907
Hey, come on, don't do this, Dave.

1634
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:49,410
Why'd I know I was
gonna hear that from you?

1635
01:35:51,162 --> 01:35:52,413
Okay.

1636
01:36:12,225 --> 01:36:12,976
Ah.

1637
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:26,531
Come on.

1638
01:36:31,869 --> 01:36:32,620
Oh, man.

1639
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:34,497
You all right?

1640
01:36:34,831 --> 01:36:35,873
-Am I all right?

1641
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:37,667
Every time I get shot,
you ask am I all right.

1642
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:39,127
No, I'm not all right, it fuckin' hurts.

1643
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:40,545
You want me to carry the money?

1644
01:36:40,878 --> 01:36:42,005
No, that's okay.

1645
01:36:42,338 --> 01:36:45,008
Oh, man, we gotta get
outta this, I'm telling you.

1646
01:36:45,341 --> 01:36:45,967
But I tell you something,

1647
01:36:46,301 --> 01:36:48,344
we took down them fuckin' farmers.

1648
01:36:50,138 --> 01:36:51,514
What is with you and
the farmers all the time?

1649
01:36:51,848 --> 01:36:52,348
What do you mean with the farmers?

1650
01:36:52,682 --> 01:36:53,349
You know what it is.

1651
01:36:54,684 --> 01:36:56,269
It's not that I have a hatred for them,

1652
01:36:56,602 --> 01:36:58,146
they're just stupid, you know?

1653
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:00,106
The way they dress with them overalls

1654
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,399
and their hats...

1655
01:37:02,525 --> 01:37:04,152
You ever been on a farm?

1656
01:37:06,195 --> 01:37:07,655
You know, with the corn,

1657
01:37:07,989 --> 01:37:09,073
and there's nothin' to fuckin'...

1658
01:37:09,407 --> 01:37:11,326
They call soda "pop", these idiots.

1659
01:37:11,659 --> 01:37:12,535
Do you understand?

1660
01:37:13,703 --> 01:37:16,789
You go into a store, it says
club soda, not club pop.

1661
01:37:17,123 --> 01:37:18,624
They're 200 years behind the times,

1662
01:37:18,958 --> 01:37:20,043
I'm telling you something.

1663
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:22,420
And another thing, you
see them on the news

1664
01:37:22,754 --> 01:37:24,088
every time it fuckin' rains.

1665
01:37:24,422 --> 01:37:26,799
Every time, "Well, we're flooded again!"

1666
01:37:27,133 --> 01:37:28,051
Yeah, you're fucking flooded!

1667
01:37:28,384 --> 01:37:29,552
The flood comes every year.

1668
01:37:29,886 --> 01:37:31,304
Then you're in your little
fuckin' boat over there

1669
01:37:31,637 --> 01:37:33,014
in a canoe, whatever!

1670
01:37:33,348 --> 01:37:34,724
Move, you assholes!

1671
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:35,892
Stupid ass.

1672
01:37:36,225 --> 01:37:36,726
You know what we should do?

1673
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:38,186
We should start a card company.

1674
01:37:38,519 --> 01:37:39,729
Yeah, just for farmers.

1675
01:37:40,063 --> 01:37:42,065
Like, for Thanksgiving.

1676
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:44,776
"God bless the bean and fig,

1677
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:49,072
your mother is a big fat
fuckin' suckling pig."

1678
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:52,533
And then the New Years card.

1679
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:56,621
"The old year is gone,
oh how time does fly,

1680
01:37:56,954 --> 01:38:00,458
to you and your family,
I hope you all die."
