00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,677
What you doing in my room?

181
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,054
(scoffs) Um, I'm sorry.

182
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:57,698
I-I didn't mean to, like... I wasn't...

183
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,517
No, no. Sorry, it's boring out there.

184
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,185

185
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,085

187
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,130
Thanks.

188
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,430
I have condoms.

189
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,974
Um, I don't...

190
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,267
I don't think we should...

191
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:43,352
Glenn.

192
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,145
- Trust me.
- Glenn, stop.

193
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,105
- What's wrong, babe?
- (sighs)

194
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:49,107
You're really drunk.

195
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,026
Okay.

196
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,199
Um...

197
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,076
I think I'm gonna go.

198
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:01,411
Really?

199
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,581
It's late.

200
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,875
(sighs)

201
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,293
All right, I'll drive you.

202
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:09,711
I'll-I'll get a ride.

203
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,755
I can call you an Uber.

204
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,007
My dad doesn't let me
get in cars with strangers.

205
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,469
Your dad kind of sucks.

206
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,972
(moaning)

207
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,230
This is way better
than grading French Lit papers.

208
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,314
You think?

209
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:30,857

210
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:36,279

211
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:39,658
ANNIE: You know what would really
tip things in your favor?

212
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,660
If you brought me some wine.

213
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,370
Sure.

214
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,414
- It's in the kitchen?
- No, it's down the street.

215
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,666
I don't actually feel like
drinking any right now.

216
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,044
I'm just out, and I'm too lazy
to go pick some up.

217
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,106
You want me to go out
and buy you a bottle of wine?

218
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,774
- Yeah, a couple bottles.
- (chuckles): Okay.

219
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,299
Cabernet?

220
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,635
And risk staining these pearly whites?

221
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,555
I don't think so. Chardonnay all the way.

222
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,390
(laughs)

223
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:09,020
When I was a kid, I thought pearly whites
were the same thing as pearly gates.

224
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:12,315
Like you died
and there were these giant gates

225
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,526
made of teeth up in the clouds.

226
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,902
Oh.

00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,195

What does that mean?

230
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,828
That means... (sighs)

231
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,663
"I'm not gonna get any wine, am I?"

232
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,665
- Definitely not.
- Mm.

233
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,588
- I can't believe I dropped trou for you.
- Mm.

234
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,669
(phone vibrating)

235
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,508
Another woman?

236
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,760
You're not getting attached,
are you, Annie?

237
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,263
You're in my phone as "Booty Call Max."

238
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,473
(chuckles)

239
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:48,852
Hello.

240
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,479
Hey, Tami, what's up?

241
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,698
- What happened? Are you okay?
- No, yeah.

242
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,201
I'm-I'm fine. It's just...

243
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,844
Glenn and his friends were bro-ing out.

244
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,412
Uh, I'm sorry I called.

245
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:09,831
I-I tried Sandra first,
but she wasn't picking up and...

246
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:12,083
No, no, she-she's at my sister's.

247
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,585
I promise I wasn't doing anything.

248
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,004
I was... What was I doing? Doing my nails.

249
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,924
Well, thank you.

250
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,133
(laughs):
It's fine.

251
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,343
Come on.

252
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,643
You're probably gonna hate me,
but I called your dad.

253
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,312
And he wants me to take you home.

254
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,813
You called him?

255
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,273
Hey, I'm sorry.

256
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:37,234
It's a parent thing.

257
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,069
It makes you feel any better,

258
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,821
Sandra is gonna be livid at me
for ratting you out.

259
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,911
Were you drinking?

260
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,372
- Do you want to Breathalyze me?
- Hey, drop the tone.

261
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,707
Why'd you lie to me? Wally?
Why'd you lie to me?

262
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,001
- I didn't think you'd let me go.
- Yeah, that's right.

263
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,479
If you would've said,
"I'm going to Glenn's house

264
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,065
and his parents aren't gonna be there and
he's gonna be having a party," I would...

265
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,173
It wasn't a party, Dad.

266
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:01,359
It was just a couple of Glenn's friends.

267
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:02,884
He's just not a good influence.

268
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:05,112
You never did things like this
before you started seeing him.

269
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,721
Don't I get any credit for calling Tami

270
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,848
instead of letting someone drunk
drive me home?

271
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:10,326
- I thought you weren't drinking.
- I wasn't!

272
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,143
But the teenage boys you were with were?

273
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:14,396
- You're making this worse.
- That's why I left, Dad.

274
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,481
I didn't want to be there.

275
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:20,110
But, I guess, next time,
I won't try and do the responsible thing.

276
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,194
Okay.

277
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,700
I'm not gonna say
you can't see Glenn anymore.

278
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,453
But you're grounded.

279
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,997
Three weeks.

280
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,873
That's the rest of summer break.

281
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,877
If you hadn't called Tami,
it would've been more.

282
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:45,677

DR. WOOD:
<i>It's called a chordoma.</i>

285
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,728
It's a bone tumor
at the base of the skull.

286

Slow-growing but malignant.

Uh, so what do we do?

296
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:34,142
The only effective treatment is surgery
followed by radiation.

297
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,436
The lucky version of the tumor

298
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,940
would have allowed us to do
an endoscopic endonasal procedure.

299
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:45,487
But we need to do a craniotomy
for a total resection.

and placement of the tumor,</i>

302
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:54,329
<i>This one would involve
proximity to the brain stem,</i>

303
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:58,541
<i>and... I hate to have
to tell you this, but...</i>

304
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:02,087
there is a large chance
you don't survive the surgery.

305
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,630
What...

306
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,883
What's a large chance?

307
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,760
Every patient is different.

308
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,845
50/50 or...?

309
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,598
20 percent?

310
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:16,559
Ab-About a 20% chance
we're able to remove it all

00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,433
Yeah, we've met.

356
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,354
So when are you having the surgery?

357
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:07,730
I'm not.

358
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,944
I don't see how I can risk it.

359
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:16,698
My daughter's not ready
for me to be dead in...

360
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,033
I don't know, like, a week.

361
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,578
You have any family?

362
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,121
Anyone who can step in and...

363
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,998
No, I don't have any brothers or sisters.

364
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,458
My parents are gone.

365
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:31,921
So I am kind of it for her.

366
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,548
Where's her mom?

367
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:34,924
Don't tell me she's dead, too.

368
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,843
I can't handle that.

369
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,011
No.

370
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:41,097
She left me for my friend Dale

371
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,267
and, uh, took off when Wally was a baby.

372
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,519
This is all really shitty,

373
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:50,607
but your wife leaving you for a Dale
might just take the cake.

374
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,442
(chuckles)

375
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,360
You know where she is?

376
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:57,864
I think so.

377
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,824
I just, um...

378
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,998
Do you think, before I die,

379
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,125
I should help my kid meet her mom?

380
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,420
Fuck. Um...

381
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,255
I don't know. Uh...

382
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,798
Probably?

383
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,301
(sighs)
I'm really not the person to ask.

384
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,762

- Max.

I wish I was somebody

386
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:27,644
who could deal with this stuff, but...

387
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:33,107
...you know, I-I'm not the girl
you booty-call sometimes

388
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:37,070
because I'm great at relationships.

389
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,781
I thought you were the one
booty-calling me.

- Sorry, I didn't mean to...
- No.

391
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:47,330
No, I'm sorry.

from college?

432
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:14,936
The point is we're gonna reunite.

433
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,562
It's a reunion.

434
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:17,998
You're gonna know
a couple of people there.

435
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:19,565
You know Guy.

436
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:21,400

Well, who's gonna feed Maurice?

440
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,967
He's supposed to be low maintenance.

441
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,076
That's why we got Maurice.

442
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,703

501
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,116

I was trying to teach you
both sides of yourself.

505
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:22,832
No, that did not work.

506
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,001

507

(smacks lips)

508
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:30,172
I was thinking of starting in the Balkans.

509
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,507
Maybe Bosnia.

510
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,883
Bosnia?

511
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:35,052
That's your dream,
to go get swept up in a civil war?

512
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,513
Oh, my God, Dad,
I'm pretty sure the war there

513
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,140
literally ended before I was born.

514
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:40,725
Wally, you are smart.

515
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:43,686
You can't throw away your future.

516
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,813
You-you got your whole life to travel.

517
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,524
I don't believe that.

518
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,610
People who play it safe when they're young
play it safe their whole lives.

519
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:03,414
I think we're past
any crowded freeway traffic.

520

We're not done talking about this.

521

Don't do the eye thing.

(horns honking and blaring)

523
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:17,178
Wally, you have to drive at the same speed
as the flow of traffic.

524
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,972
I know. That was, like,
question three on my permit test.

You're not ready for multitasking.

530

- The music just... it calms me.

my-my dad wanted to take me
to the beach for the first time,

916

on the corner of the coffee table.

That's a really beautiful story.

1187
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,312
We got divorced.

1188

A few years ago now.

1189
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:51,148
Thought you were soul mates.

1190
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:54,610
We were soul mates for a little while.

1191
01:00:55,903 --> 01:00:58,864
And then, uh, she left me, too.

- No. Ugh.

01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:29,296
She couldn't focus on everything at once.

1576
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,238
- That's all.
- Why are you lying to me?

1577
01:22:31,322 --> 01:22:32,490
I'm not.

1578
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:34,217
There wasn't a work van
on the street, Dad.

1579
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:35,409
There weren't any cars.

1580
01:22:35,493 --> 01:22:36,595
She didn't have workers there.

1581
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:38,996
She's not getting her floors redone.

1582
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:41,040
Okay? So, ei-either she's a crackhead

1583
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:43,084
and-and you just didn't want me
to meet her

1584
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:45,169
or she doesn't want to meet me.

1585
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:50,800
She has a baby.

1586
01:22:52,677 --> 01:22:56,305
She said her life is too complicated
to meet you right now. Come here.

1587
01:22:56,389 --> 01:22:57,991
Stop. Stop telling me things
are complicated.

1588
01:22:58,015 --> 01:22:59,433
It means nothing.

1589
01:22:59,517 --> 01:23:00,827
Wally, we got to talk about this.

1590
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:02,311
What is wrong with you?!

1591
01:23:02,395 --> 01:23:03,664
You brought us to a freaking nude beach?!

1592
01:23:03,688 --> 01:23:05,916
MAX: I didn't know it was a nude beach.
I just GPS'd the closest one.

1593
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:07,900
'Cause I needed to be further scarred
by this day.

1594
01:23:07,942 --> 01:23:09,294
You can never tell anyone
that I brought you here, okay?

1595
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:11,070
I would die
before I tell anyone about this!

1596
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:13,406
(gasps) God! (gags)

1597
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:15,408
(grunts) Dad, stop!

1598
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:16,659
Stop touching me!

1599
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:18,035
Wally, calm down! Calm down!

1600
01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:19,995
No, I-I don't want to calm down!

1601
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:22,998
Did you think I wouldn't figure out
that she didn't want to meet me?

1602
01:23:23,082 --> 01:23:24,726
Or w-were you gonna lie to me
again tomorrow

1603
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,752
and the next day and the next day?

1604
01:23:26,836 --> 01:23:28,462
Clearly I didn't have a plan, okay?

1605
01:23:28,546 --> 01:23:30,214
I just didn't want to see you sad.

1606
01:23:30,297 --> 01:23:33,175
You know what?
That worked out perfect, Dad.

1607
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:38,180
What's her replacement kid's name?

1608
01:23:38,264 --> 01:23:39,473
She's not a replacement.

1609
01:23:39,557 --> 01:23:41,559
Maybe you don't know
the meaning of the word.

1610
01:23:43,978 --> 01:23:46,021
Elizabeth.

1611
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:48,691
Dumbest name ever.

1612
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:51,277
She was just overwhelmed.

1613
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,320
Sweetheart, I know she'll come around.

1614
01:23:55,448 --> 01:23:56,449
Wally.

1615
01:23:57,825 --> 01:23:59,785

No, we're not leaving until you meet her!

1628

I know deep down she wants to see you.

1629
01:24:53,172 --> 01:24:54,548
Then why didn't she ever try to?

1630
01:24:54,632 --> 01:24:56,926
God, I wish you never put this stupid idea
in my head!

1631
01:24:57,009 --> 01:24:59,553
You should've just let me keep
this fantasy version of her

1632
01:24:59,637 --> 01:25:02,890
that somewhere out there
was a woman who regretted abandoning me

1633
01:25:02,973 --> 01:25:04,683
and wished she could have me back.

1634
01:25:04,767 --> 01:25:06,227
But you didn't.

1635
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:07,436
You ruined everything.

1636
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:08,771
I want to go home.

1637
01:25:10,231 --> 01:25:12,316
- You have to meet her.
- I thought I wasn't

1638
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:14,735
supposed to want someone
who doesn't want me back.

1639
01:25:14,819 --> 01:25:16,445
So this is, this is different. Uh...

1640
01:25:16,529 --> 01:25:17,947
Are you still in love with her?

1641
01:25:21,659 --> 01:25:23,077
Not even close.

1642
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,454
So why are you doing this to me?

1643
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:41,720
Um...

1644
01:25:51,605 --> 01:25:53,941
I have a tumor

1645
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:56,610
in my head

1646
01:25:56,694 --> 01:26:00,030
that's giving me less than a year.

1647
01:26:02,449 --> 01:26:08,205
If I let them operate to try to remove it,

1648
01:26:08,289 --> 01:26:10,791
uh, they could kill me on the table.

1649
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:13,627
So I-I can't do that.

1650
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:19,425
I have to spend this year
fixing things for you while I still can.

Hey, come on.

Wally, let's talk about this.

1666
01:27:00,424 --> 01:27:02,343
<i>I know this sucks.</i>

1667
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:04,511
- I get it, okay?
- Oh, you get it?

- Slow down. Shit.

Listen, I understand you're upset, okay?

1673

<i>I'm obviously upset, too.</i>

01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:18,752
<i>- We need to talk about it.
- Oh, you don't want</i>

No! I want you to stop driving!

1677
01:27:21,862 --> 01:27:23,089
I didn't make you come with me!

1678

Maybe you shouldn't have

01:27:32,373 --> 01:27:33,916
MAX:
Okay.

1683
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:35,876
All right, we're gonna get arrested.

1684
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:37,670
<i>That's good. That's what I need right now.</i>

1685

1686
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:43,634
<i>How many times
do I have to tell you to stop?!</i>

1687
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:45,678
I don't know. I guess we'll see.

1688
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:47,596
What point is this proving?!

1689
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:48,931
(tires screeching)

1690
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:50,516
<i>Jesus!</i>

1691
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:52,101
Wally! Stop!

1692
01:27:55,312 --> 01:27:56,855
You could've killed somebody!

1693
01:27:59,066 --> 01:28:01,527
- MAN: You all right?
- Wally?

1694
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:03,028
MAN:
Hey, where-where's she going?

1695
01:28:03,112 --> 01:28:04,655
Wally!

1696
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:08,701
I'm sorry. I-I'll be right back!

1697
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:10,911
Sorry!

1698
01:28:10,995 --> 01:28:12,538
Wally!

1699
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:15,082
Stop! Stop!

1700
01:28:15,165 --> 01:28:16,500
Hey!

1701
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:19,461
Hey!

1702
01:28:19,545 --> 01:28:21,630
Hey. What the hell was that?!

1703
01:28:21,714 --> 01:28:24,383
- I hate you. I hate you.
- For what?

1704
01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:26,844
You find out that you're...

1705
01:28:26,927 --> 01:28:28,929
that you have a tumor,
and instead of telling me,

1706
01:28:29,013 --> 01:28:31,682
you try to pawn me off onto some woman
who doesn't even want me?

1707
01:28:31,765 --> 01:28:33,642
Do you not realize
how screwed-up that is?!

1708
01:28:33,726 --> 01:28:36,603
Oh, fuck, Wally.

1709
01:28:36,687 --> 01:28:38,564
When are you gonna grow up?!

1710
01:28:38,647 --> 01:28:40,899
I am sorry that I am dying

1711
01:28:40,983 --> 01:28:43,277
and something in this world
isn't about you.

1712
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,654
And I'm sorry that I gave up
on all the things

1713
01:28:45,738 --> 01:28:47,656
that I wanted in life to make you happy.

1714
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:49,116
'Cause you know what?

1715
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:51,035
You are never happy!

1716
01:28:51,118 --> 01:28:52,745
I didn't make you give up anything.

1717
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:55,247
That is all you
because that is what you do.

1718
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:58,250
You don't bet on yourself.
You don't believe you can win.

1719
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:01,670
But, hey, at least you're gonna leave me
with a clear philosophy, right?

1720
01:29:01,754 --> 01:29:03,213
I'm not leaving you with that.

1721
01:29:03,297 --> 01:29:06,592
Then why wouldn't you let them
try to take the tumor out?!

1722
01:29:09,428 --> 01:29:11,555
What do you want me to say?

1723
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:14,725
That you're not gonna die.

1724
01:29:14,808 --> 01:29:17,728
I thought you didn't want me
to lie to you, baby.

1725
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:21,607
Is it 100% certain
that the surgery won't work?

1726
01:29:23,817 --> 01:29:25,694
- No, but...
- So, if you do nothing,

1727
01:29:25,778 --> 01:29:30,324
you definitely die, and if you
do something, you potentially live.

1728
01:29:30,407 --> 01:29:32,576
How is that not a clear choice?

1729
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:38,415
I don't want you for one year, Dad.

1730
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:42,920
I want you for my whole life.

1731
01:29:43,962 --> 01:29:48,425
Don't you want to yell at me when I get
some stupid tattoo like you did?

1732
01:29:48,509 --> 01:29:50,552
You're supposed to... I don't know.

1733
01:29:50,636 --> 01:29:53,305
You're supposed to laugh
when I trip at my own wedding.

1734
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:55,224
And I'm supposed to be obnoxious

1735
01:29:55,307 --> 01:29:58,685
when you finally introduce me
to some woman you're dating.

1736
01:29:58,769 --> 01:30:00,437
Dad, I love you.

1737
01:30:00,521 --> 01:30:03,816
And I know I don't always show it,
and I'm sorry,

1738
01:30:03,899 --> 01:30:06,860
but, uh, I thought we had more time.

1739
01:30:06,944 --> 01:30:09,905
I thought we were gonna go back
to that field in Texas

1740
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:11,281
and watch the meteor shower.

1741
01:30:11,365 --> 01:30:15,160
I thought... I thought we were gonna
do all that stuff together.

1742
01:30:16,829 --> 01:30:18,497
Don't you want to?

1743
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,502
