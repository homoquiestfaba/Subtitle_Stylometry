1
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:33,438
We live in times of such
rapid change...

2
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:36,109
...that it's easy
to feel overwhelmed.

3
00:00:36,311 --> 00:00:40,042
We believe that we're not
in control of our lives.

4
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,045
The demands are so high.

5
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:47,051
We hear in our media how our future
may not be as great as our past.

6
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:51,954
We're caught up in making a living
instead of designing our lives.

7
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,060
We forgot what we're capable of.

8
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:56,060
Let me tell you the truth.

9
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,631
The future will be what
we decide to make it.

10
00:01:00,134 --> 00:01:04,298
There are people who will succeed
in making a difference.

11
00:01:04,505 --> 00:01:06,234
They live with passion.

12
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:11,469
They're doing things differently
than people living in fear.

13
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,651
It's a gIorious day, isn't it?

14
00:01:26,494 --> 00:01:28,792
HeIIo, Father. Lieutenant Ambrose.

15
00:01:28,997 --> 00:01:32,433
We'd Iike to speak
with Mrs. Winterbourne.

16
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:35,394
-That wouId be me.
-Patricia Winterbourne?

17
00:01:35,603 --> 00:01:39,039
She's my daughter-in-Iaw.
What is this regarding?

18
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,401
The murder of Steven DeCunzo.

19
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,610
Then you'II want to speak with me.

20
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,612
Why is that?

21
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,911
I'm the one who kiIIed him.

22
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,249
Oh, my!

23
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:55,752
Oh, my!

24
00:01:57,258 --> 00:02:01,251
Steve DeCunzo. That's a name
l'd rather forget.

25
00:02:02,263 --> 00:02:04,254
Let's go back to the beginning.

26
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:09,169
My name's Connie Doyle.
l grew up in Hoboken, New Jersey.

27
00:02:09,937 --> 00:02:12,269
Mom died when l was 1 2.

28
00:02:12,607 --> 00:02:14,837
Dad and l just didn't get along.

29
00:02:15,443 --> 00:02:18,742
At 18, l decided to give us
both breathing room.

30
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:20,504
Besides, Ma always said:

31
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:24,845
''Destiny is waiting for you.
You just gotta go find it.''

32
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:29,055
lf you're looking for fate,
try New York City.

33
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,471
And guess who l met
that very first day?

34
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,206
Hi.

35
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:55,972
What's that behind your ear?

36
00:02:57,251 --> 00:02:59,742
-Neat.
-Steve DeCunzo.

37
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:04,521
It's nice.
But it don't say what you do.

38
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:06,993
Good cards don't do that.

39
00:03:07,195 --> 00:03:08,423
It's too showy.

40
00:03:08,696 --> 00:03:12,894
-See, I'm an agent.
-Wow! For who?

41
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:16,662
I'm not at Iiberty to say.
It's professionaI ethics.

42
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:18,236
How oId are you?

43
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:21,670
Eighteen. Today's my birthday.

44
00:03:21,876 --> 00:03:23,434
You're shitting me.

45
00:03:24,946 --> 00:03:27,107
You seem so mature.

46
00:03:27,615 --> 00:03:31,449
-ReaIIy?
-That's it. We gotta ceIebrate.

47
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,017
Happy birthday!

48
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:39,623
For me?

49
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:45,328
Steve assured me l was both
beautiful and unappreciated.

50
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:48,593
The last thing a teenage girl
wants to hear.

51
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,130
Yeah, l fell for it.

52
00:03:52,874 --> 00:03:54,535
Moved right in with him.

53
00:03:54,876 --> 00:03:56,241
What the heII....

54
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,344
lt was okay for a while.

55
00:03:58,546 --> 00:04:01,174
Maybe he didn't give
me flowers, but...

56
00:04:01,382 --> 00:04:04,283
...l sure had my pick
of stolen car radios.

57
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:08,953
The important thing was,
he took care of me.

58
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:12,217
And he didn't ask
for too much in return.

59
00:04:13,895 --> 00:04:17,626
But if this was supposed
to be my big destiny thing...

60
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,900
...l was expecting a little more.

61
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,332
Come on, Ma. Give me a sign.

62
00:04:45,927 --> 00:04:47,155
I'm pregnant!

63
00:04:48,095 --> 00:04:49,585
Isn't that great?

64
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,133
What do you mean you're pregnant?

65
00:04:58,272 --> 00:05:00,433
What do you mean, ''What do I mean''?

66
00:05:01,108 --> 00:05:04,305
I took a test and it came out positive.

67
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,104
We're gonna have a baby!

68
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:10,040
You're gonna teII me it's mine?

69
00:05:10,952 --> 00:05:15,514
-Of course it is. I mean, who eIse?
-Don't give me that shit!

70
00:05:16,424 --> 00:05:18,255
You screwed Connie, didn't you?

71
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,827
No, man, never.

72
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:22,928
I said, ''Did you screw Connie?''

73
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:26,590
Sure, I did. Yeah, Iots.

74
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:29,366
SIut.

75
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:34,806
-Get rid of it.
-I'm not getting rid of it!

76
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,395
So ends my brief history with men.

77
00:06:01,135 --> 00:06:04,468
After that, l just kept getting bigger.

78
00:06:04,972 --> 00:06:08,533
They fired me as a waitress.
The uniform didn't fit.

79
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:12,941
So l blew my money on luxuries
like food and toothpaste.

80
00:06:13,147 --> 00:06:15,138
My time at the Yran out.

81
00:06:15,983 --> 00:06:19,146
l was about to spend
the night on the streets.

82
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,823
Now l got this baby to think about,
and l just can't let that happen.

83
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,775
It's Connie! I'm about to have your
baby in the street. Come watch!

84
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,170
Steve's out at the moment.

85
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:47,946
Hey!

86
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,614
I need a pIace to stay!
You owe me that!

87
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,590
-This ain't home!
-You owe me!

88
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,660
You don't want me
to come down there.

89
00:07:01,862 --> 00:07:05,059
-I want you to come down here!
-I wiII!

90
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:08,326
-Come on down then!
-I'm not coming down!

91
00:07:08,536 --> 00:07:12,370
I'm teIIing you, I got no pIace!
I got no money!

92
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:15,097
Here.

93
00:07:18,212 --> 00:07:21,079
You wanted to have a baby? Fine.

94
00:07:21,282 --> 00:07:22,715
Have it in the street.

95
00:07:23,217 --> 00:07:24,775
That's it, Steve!

96
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,510
Jesus Christ.

97
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:28,086
UnbeIievabIe.

98
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,085
Don't try to bIow me off Iike that.

99
00:07:33,894 --> 00:07:35,725
Get over here.

100
00:08:26,113 --> 00:08:27,740
I'II heIp you pray.

101
00:08:27,948 --> 00:08:30,678
Give an oId man a quarter?

102
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,547
No? I'II heIp you to your train.

103
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:51,397
Get your hands off me.
Don't touch me! Nobody touches me!

104
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:53,630
Somebody touched you.

105
00:09:04,151 --> 00:09:05,345
Here.

106
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,880
I was saving it. But, go on, take it.

107
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:13,852
Gee.

108
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:19,792
And here's a sheIter on the West Side.

109
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,595
I mean, they pray at you,
but the food's okay.

110
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:36,681
Thanks.

111
00:10:00,374 --> 00:10:01,398
Wait a second!

112
00:10:03,077 --> 00:10:05,341
-Look out!
-HoId it. Wait.

113
00:10:07,781 --> 00:10:09,009
Board!

114
00:10:09,216 --> 00:10:10,478
This ain't the subway!

115
00:10:14,054 --> 00:10:15,316
Let me out!

116
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,268
-Hey, where does this train go?
-Boston.

117
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:32,733
Tickets!

118
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,538
Tickets!

119
00:10:40,748 --> 00:10:42,147
Tickets!

120
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:44,749
-Mister, pIease!
-Ticket!

121
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:52,156
My husband must have it. Steve!

122
00:11:06,507 --> 00:11:07,940
Ticket.

123
00:11:09,743 --> 00:11:12,610
I have her tickets, sir.

124
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:15,745
ToId you I had a husband.

125
00:11:17,418 --> 00:11:20,581
Of course she has.
I mean, Iook at her.

126
00:11:21,355 --> 00:11:24,153
Or are you impIying something
about my wife?

127
00:11:24,758 --> 00:11:26,089
No, sir!

128
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:28,417
Sorry, sir.

129
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:32,764
Wow, thanks!

130
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:37,129
I've had a rough coupIe of days.
We're not reaIIy married, are we?

131
00:11:37,972 --> 00:11:39,735
No, we're not.

132
00:11:41,175 --> 00:11:44,042
You Iook very thirsty.
WouId you Iike a soda?

133
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,941
-Thanks.
-You're weIcome.

134
00:11:48,182 --> 00:11:50,616
-Let's go sit down.
-ReaIIy?

135
00:11:55,189 --> 00:11:58,022
I'm teIIing you,
you'II never find a seat.

136
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,771
I had no idea it wouId be
this crowded.

137
00:12:12,973 --> 00:12:14,941
I forgot about spring break.

138
00:12:15,142 --> 00:12:18,305
Those coIIege days
seem a miIIion miIes away.

139
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,970
Don't they ever?

140
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:23,780
Patricia.

141
00:12:23,984 --> 00:12:25,042
Hugh.

142
00:12:27,054 --> 00:12:29,614
Is there something I shouId know?

143
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,986
I picked up a pregnant woman
in the cIub car.

144
00:12:33,227 --> 00:12:36,492
He has a thing for us.
Did you get my drink?

145
00:12:36,997 --> 00:12:40,160
-He gave it to me.
-I Iike her better than you.

146
00:12:41,068 --> 00:12:43,400
WouId you get me another one?

147
00:12:44,338 --> 00:12:46,431
Why not? I mean, who knows?

148
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,098
Maybe I'II get Iucky again. PIay nice.

149
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,211
-Hi.
-My name's Connie.

150
00:12:57,117 --> 00:12:58,675
Oh, man! I'm sorry.

151
00:12:58,886 --> 00:13:01,684
It's aII right. That's okay.
HardIy anything.

152
00:13:02,556 --> 00:13:06,014
I'II cIean that right up. Here.
I'm so sorry.

153
00:13:06,226 --> 00:13:09,161
I've got-- Here. Here we go.

154
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,799
-Here.
-There, got it.

155
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,165
No probIem.

156
00:13:17,905 --> 00:13:20,772
So, how far aIong are you?

157
00:13:20,974 --> 00:13:24,569
Oh, I don't know. TweIve, 1 3 months.

158
00:13:25,746 --> 00:13:30,046
You know, you are my first
American conversation.

159
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,413
-I've Iived in Hong Kong since I was 8.
-Yeah?

160
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,487
We throw soda now. It's a new thing.

161
00:13:40,627 --> 00:13:44,461
Anyway, I'm gonna meet Hugh's famiIy.
I'm so nervous.

162
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:51,100
Oh, my God! You're soaked, aren't you?
Put it on.

163
00:13:51,305 --> 00:13:53,239
-Yeah?
-Oh, I insist.

164
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,670
Anyway, my dad was a banker.

165
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,471
About a year ago, my dad died.

166
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,114
I didn't know what I was going to do.

167
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:07,013
I didn't have anybody.
I don't even remember my mom.

168
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,079
I'm sorry.

169
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,587
Feet get big when you're pregnant.

170
00:14:15,796 --> 00:14:19,425
I haven't seen feet this big
since I saw the Knicks.

171
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:23,399
WeII, Iook at my fingers.
Like hot dogs.

172
00:14:24,304 --> 00:14:26,465
I gotta get this ring off.

173
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:31,944
-Shoot!
-Oh, no!

174
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:38,607
''Dear Penthouse, I thought
it wouId be a IoneIy ride--''

175
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:43,620
There's an empty tabIe.
If we move right now, we can eat. Yes?

176
00:14:43,824 --> 00:14:44,813
Be right there.

177
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,754
-He'II kiII me if I Iose it.
-I'II get it.

178
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,725
-I got it.
-Good.

179
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,059
Wow. God, it's beautifuI.

180
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,237
Thank you. Thanks.

181
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:02,573
-That's so sweet.
-Go ahead, try it on.

182
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:06,542
-Isn't that bad Iuck?
-I couIdn't have bad Iuck.

183
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,613
We gotta go.

184
00:15:18,392 --> 00:15:19,381
Here.

185
00:16:17,918 --> 00:16:19,078
My baby.

186
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:22,414
-My baby!
-CarefuI, honey.

187
00:16:22,623 --> 00:16:25,615
-Where's my baby?
-Your baby's fine.

188
00:16:25,826 --> 00:16:27,726
-What?
-Your baby's fine.

189
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:32,298
I wanna see him. Her, it, whatever!

190
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:34,626
We'II see what we can do.

191
00:16:35,802 --> 00:16:39,465
What you can do is bring me
my baby, that's what.

192
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,135
Right.

193
00:16:58,592 --> 00:17:00,184
Jeez.

194
00:17:01,728 --> 00:17:03,127
There you are.

195
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:08,029
It's so sweet.
Just Iike a IittIe cookie.

196
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:13,035
Hey, Ieave me aIone!
I know what I'm doing!

197
00:17:17,344 --> 00:17:22,111
Mommy doesn't reaIIy know
what she's doing. She was Iying.

198
00:17:28,055 --> 00:17:29,545
Two Iegs.

199
00:17:30,123 --> 00:17:33,684
Two arms. Hands.

200
00:17:34,561 --> 00:17:39,760
Toes. 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 1 0. EIeven?

201
00:17:41,134 --> 00:17:42,499
No, no. Ten toes.

202
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,938
Oh, you're my IittIe boy.

203
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:52,509
You be carefuI with that, cookie.

204
00:17:52,713 --> 00:17:54,977
Those things can do a Iot of damage.

205
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,548
Nice digs.

206
00:18:07,094 --> 00:18:09,562
Look at the nice stuff.

207
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,401
Oh, shit!

208
00:18:19,806 --> 00:18:21,205
Nurse!

209
00:18:21,408 --> 00:18:22,602
Miss!

210
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:26,142
Miss, you brought me
the wrong goddamn baby!

211
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,377
It's too bad.

212
00:18:28,582 --> 00:18:30,140
You're a nice one.

213
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:33,580
Miss! What--?

214
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:48,090
-Mrs. Winterbourne?
-What?

215
00:18:48,602 --> 00:18:52,504
-How're you feeIing?
-You guys got this aII screwed up!

216
00:18:52,706 --> 00:18:55,732
WouIdn't be a first.
Remember the accident?

217
00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:59,935
I was in a train wreck!
Who'd forget a train wreck?

218
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:04,547
-How Iong have I been here?
-About eight days.

219
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:06,942
HoIy crap!

220
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,488
Where's here?

221
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:12,716
You're at St. DecIan HospitaI
in Stamford, Connecticut.

222
00:19:12,926 --> 00:19:15,986
There was another pregnant
Iady on the train.

223
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,220
Did you know her?

224
00:19:17,964 --> 00:19:21,627
Did? Oh, Jesus, God!

225
00:19:22,135 --> 00:19:24,501
-Is she dead?!
-Mrs. Winterbourne....

226
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,173
WiII you pIease stop caIIing me that!

227
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,002
What's that? What the heII is this?!

228
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,974
Nothing. Something to reIax you.

229
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,143
I don't need to reIax!
I need to straighten this--

230
00:19:40,854 --> 00:19:43,482
Wait. Where're you going with him?

231
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,988
Listen to me. I'm not--

232
00:19:48,161 --> 00:19:50,561
That feeIs nice.

233
00:19:52,165 --> 00:19:55,828
-WouId you Iike onion rings with that?
-Yes.

234
00:20:19,392 --> 00:20:21,826
Did Dr. HopIey say we couId waIk?

235
00:20:22,028 --> 00:20:25,486
There's something important
I must teII you.

236
00:20:25,699 --> 00:20:30,159
Are we gonna have a bad day?
I thought we'd have a good day.

237
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:33,066
We'II be good. It'II be good.

238
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:38,176
I sounded hystericaI before,
so you didn't wanna Iisten to me.

239
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:40,175
I'm gonna be reaI caIm...

240
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,747
...when I teII you there's been
one major screw-up!

241
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,043
-Is that so?
-Yes, it's so!

242
00:20:46,253 --> 00:20:49,689
Look, I gotta taIk to Hugh!

243
00:20:51,858 --> 00:20:54,520
Oh, no! Not him too!

244
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:58,558
Oh, God, no! No!

245
00:21:10,577 --> 00:21:12,568
Found this card in her purse.

246
00:21:14,548 --> 00:21:16,038
Connie DoyIe?

247
00:21:17,717 --> 00:21:22,177
-No, I'm sorry. I never heard of her.
-How'd she get your card?

248
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:26,257
I give those to every chick I meet.
You shouId try it.

249
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:29,917
-I'II remember that.
-Sorry I couIdn't heIp you out.

250
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:36,959
lt feels good to be here tonight!

251
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,968
Yeah, 39 million people watching me!

252
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,641
lt feels real good to be here!

253
00:21:45,078 --> 00:21:46,568
Connie's dead.

254
00:21:47,747 --> 00:21:52,741
-Who's Connie?
-The bitch who hoIIered at the window.

255
00:21:52,953 --> 00:21:54,284
--example of Dianetics!

256
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:56,921
-Dead?
-Yeah.

257
00:21:58,091 --> 00:21:59,991
She was gonna have my baby.

258
00:22:02,162 --> 00:22:03,754
Makes you think, doesn't it?

259
00:22:04,931 --> 00:22:06,125
Dead, dead, dead!

260
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:10,599
There's something mysterious
about the secret squares!

261
00:22:10,804 --> 00:22:13,329
That Bobcat GoIdthwait is so funny!

262
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,809
l am every parent's dream!

263
00:22:18,745 --> 00:22:20,713
Okay, cookie. We're going.

264
00:22:20,914 --> 00:22:22,609
Whose teIephone is that?

265
00:22:23,016 --> 00:22:27,578
Is that your teIephone,
Mrs. Winterbourne?

266
00:22:27,787 --> 00:22:28,845
Is everything okay?

267
00:22:31,992 --> 00:22:34,825
Is everything okay, Mrs. Winterbourne?

268
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:38,454
-Aren't you gonna answer?
-Is that it?

269
00:22:38,665 --> 00:22:41,964
I thought it was a ringing in my ears!

270
00:22:43,536 --> 00:22:46,369
-HeIIo?
-Hello? This is Mrs. Winterbourne.

271
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,135
-What?
-Hugh's mother. Patricia?

272
00:22:49,342 --> 00:22:52,971
-I feeI so awfuI about this.
-l know, we all do.

273
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:56,239
Yeah. No. Jesus, this is difficuIt.

274
00:22:56,449 --> 00:23:00,010
l wanted to see you.
The doctors say l can't travel.

275
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,688
l'm surprised they don't chain you.

276
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:05,517
You don't have to talk now, dear.

277
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:09,752
You don't have any family here,
so consider our house--

278
00:23:09,963 --> 00:23:11,191
That's nice, but--

279
00:23:11,398 --> 00:23:13,923
l'm your mother-in-law. Don't argue.

280
00:23:14,134 --> 00:23:16,932
That's my grandson you've got there.

281
00:23:17,137 --> 00:23:19,435
-WeII--
-l've sent a car for you.

282
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:23,075
-No, no, you can't do that!
--be expecting you.

283
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,752
-Mrs. Winterbourne?
-No.

284
00:23:34,354 --> 00:23:37,016
-That's what it says.
-Don't beIieve that.

285
00:23:40,026 --> 00:23:41,357
HoIy shit!

286
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:45,523
-What's this?
-This is a RoIIs-Royce.

287
00:23:45,865 --> 00:23:48,993
That's Iike the CadiIIac
of automobiIes, huh?

288
00:23:49,202 --> 00:23:53,161
No, the Mercedes Benz
is the CadiIIac of automobiIes.

289
00:23:53,373 --> 00:23:55,102
This is a RoIIs-Royce.

290
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:01,209
Hey, Iook, I gotta expIain something--

291
00:24:01,414 --> 00:24:05,441
You don't expIain to me.
I'm just Paco.

292
00:24:06,052 --> 00:24:10,887
You expIain to Mrs. Winterbourne.
Okay, Mrs. Winterbourne?

293
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:47,949
Do I Iook the way you expected me to?

294
00:24:48,595 --> 00:24:49,789
Not reaIIy.

295
00:24:49,996 --> 00:24:55,195
Hugh was aIways stuck on bIonds.
You know, taII and sophisticated.

296
00:24:55,402 --> 00:24:57,597
Yeah, he got tired of those.

297
00:24:59,005 --> 00:25:01,872
So he never sent any pictures of me?

298
00:25:02,175 --> 00:25:03,972
Hugh didn't Iike cameras.

299
00:25:04,177 --> 00:25:08,011
You have to deveIop the fiIm,
remember to pick it up.

300
00:25:08,214 --> 00:25:10,011
Too much responsibiIity.

301
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,339
That's Hugh.

302
00:25:12,118 --> 00:25:15,281
-Poor boy.
-Yeah.

303
00:25:34,874 --> 00:25:36,535
Oh, my God!

304
00:25:58,998 --> 00:26:02,490
-This is not right. TeII her--
-HeIIo, Patricia.

305
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,141
-Something terribIe's happened.
-Yes, I know.

306
00:26:11,344 --> 00:26:14,177
I know you had something
terribIe happen...

307
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,908
...but your terribIe thing and mine
are two different things.

308
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,850
I understand.
You Iost a husband and I Iost a son.

309
00:26:25,692 --> 00:26:27,091
You wanna hoId....

310
00:26:27,694 --> 00:26:29,184
My grandson.

311
00:26:41,107 --> 00:26:44,201
It's been so Iong
since I've done this.

312
00:26:46,613 --> 00:26:48,046
You're doing fine.

313
00:26:49,616 --> 00:26:51,208
What did you name him?

314
00:26:52,118 --> 00:26:54,712
-Cookie.
-Pardon?

315
00:26:56,456 --> 00:27:00,290
I was just trying it out.
I haven't decided.

316
00:27:01,127 --> 00:27:03,061
Have you thought of Hugh?

317
00:27:04,264 --> 00:27:05,629
He Iooks just Iike him.

318
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,962
Okay. Sure. Fine.

319
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,900
Hugh it is.

320
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,799
I miss him so much.

321
00:27:19,979 --> 00:27:21,276
Mother?

322
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,881
Okay. That's enough.

323
00:27:26,085 --> 00:27:28,212
-Good to see you.
-What's wrong?

324
00:27:28,421 --> 00:27:31,948
-I just-- I gotta go.
-I don't understand.

325
00:27:32,158 --> 00:27:34,092
It was nice, reaIIy.

326
00:27:37,764 --> 00:27:40,460
Didn't he teII you he had a twin?

327
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:45,895
Yes, but I didn't know
he was identicaI.

328
00:27:46,773 --> 00:27:48,638
That must've been a shock.

329
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:52,277
I'm just stiII so confused
from that train wreck.

330
00:27:52,478 --> 00:27:56,437
Of course. Anyone with a brain
wouId be sensitive to that.

331
00:27:56,649 --> 00:27:58,617
Thank you, Mother. I'm BiII.

332
00:28:01,521 --> 00:28:04,922
I wish we couId've met under
pIeasant circumstances.

333
00:28:05,158 --> 00:28:09,595
-No, this is okay.
-I meant, before the accident.

334
00:28:10,096 --> 00:28:12,326
Oh, right. Right, right, right.

335
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:16,226
WouId you Iike to hoId your nephew?

336
00:28:16,436 --> 00:28:18,495
He's a IoveIy chiId, BiII.

337
00:28:21,941 --> 00:28:24,910
LuckiIy, he doesn't Iook Iike us.

338
00:28:25,111 --> 00:28:26,408
Oh, BiII.

339
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,175
Come with me, Patricia.

340
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:47,124
I'II never get away with this.

341
00:28:48,368 --> 00:28:50,632
Oh, Mother Winterbourne. HeIIo.

342
00:28:52,705 --> 00:28:57,301
That's what I first caIIed my
mother-in-Iaw. She seemed so coId.

343
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,410
What'd you end up caIIing her?

344
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:02,877
Mother Winterbourne. She was coId.

345
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,850
I had these made
when Hugh said you were coming.

346
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:17,621
OId pictures of the boys to torment
you with during our visit.

347
00:29:19,332 --> 00:29:20,731
They're cute.

348
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:27,732
Hugh was very embarrassed
by this one of him naked.

349
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,033
Except for the cowboy hat.

350
00:29:30,243 --> 00:29:32,803
You're onIy in coIIege once,
I suppose.

351
00:29:41,487 --> 00:29:42,476
WeII.

352
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,293
I cannot cry anymore.

353
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:00,362
-CaII me Grace.
-Grace.

354
00:30:01,207 --> 00:30:02,572
Yes.

355
00:30:09,282 --> 00:30:11,307
He's so adorabIe.

356
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,656
WeII.

357
00:30:24,797 --> 00:30:27,391
Thank you for keeping this one safe.

358
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,266
Thank you.

359
00:30:38,845 --> 00:30:43,475
Can Mommy go to prison for this?
Can you say 5-to-1 0?

360
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:51,088
Where'd he find her?
Where'd they meet?

361
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:54,987
-What do you mean?
-WeII, she's hardIy in his....

362
00:30:55,661 --> 00:30:57,754
-CIass.
-FrankIy, yes.

363
00:30:58,865 --> 00:31:00,389
The water, Mother.

364
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:05,163
Admit it, there's a bit
of white trash on the edges.

365
00:31:05,571 --> 00:31:07,505
How'd I ever raise such a snob?

366
00:31:09,008 --> 00:31:10,669
It's a mystery, Mother.

367
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,477
Let's ask the servants.

368
00:31:17,984 --> 00:31:22,080
I demand that you at Ieast
give her a chance.

369
00:31:22,722 --> 00:31:24,212
I'm sorry.

370
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,359
Does it sound Iike I prejudged her?

371
00:31:27,627 --> 00:31:30,221
''White trash''? No, no.

372
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,729
-Is that a derogatory term?
-I'm serious, BiII.

373
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:38,427
Maybe she's a wonderfuI,
down-to-earth aII-American girI.

374
00:31:38,638 --> 00:31:40,731
But what do we know? Nothing!

375
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:45,138
Except that Hugh brought her,
expecting us to weIcome her...

376
00:31:45,344 --> 00:31:46,834
...with open arms.

377
00:31:47,046 --> 00:31:50,072
If he wasn't dead,
you'd be screaming at him.

378
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,513
You can be insensitive sometimes.

379
00:31:52,718 --> 00:31:54,049
Sometimes?

380
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,714
I must be sIipping.

381
00:32:00,626 --> 00:32:03,789
You know what you need?
''You Are Here'' maps.

382
00:32:03,996 --> 00:32:05,896
They're aII waiting for you.

383
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:09,101
What do you mean, ''aII''?
Who's aII waiting?

384
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,931
Just famiIy. Mrs. Winterbourne,
BiII and the Father.

385
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:17,439
I'm dying to meet him.
He never stopped taIking about him.

386
00:32:17,643 --> 00:32:21,306
Father Brian is the Monsignor.
Hugh's father died.

387
00:32:21,647 --> 00:32:22,705
Right.

388
00:32:22,915 --> 00:32:26,976
That's when she got sick.
The husband, then Hugh. Too much.

389
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,654
Sorry I was Iate.

390
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,887
I got Iost.

391
00:32:35,595 --> 00:32:39,497
I've been coming here for years,
and I stiII get Iost.

392
00:32:39,765 --> 00:32:43,360
-This is Father Brian Kirrane.
-How's it going?

393
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,996
-PIeased to meet you.
-It's a pIeasure.

394
00:32:48,207 --> 00:32:51,267
Hugh spoke of you often,
and with affection.

395
00:32:51,611 --> 00:32:53,806
Oh, that's so touching.

396
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:57,608
I haven't seen him
since his first communion.

397
00:32:59,685 --> 00:33:03,519
Oh, weII, it made a big impression.

398
00:33:04,957 --> 00:33:06,288
He was a fine man.

399
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,850
He'II be missed.

400
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,360
Thank you.

401
00:33:11,697 --> 00:33:15,724
And thank you for so generousIy
weIcoming me here.

402
00:33:16,068 --> 00:33:18,969
Hey! What's with the hands?

403
00:33:19,171 --> 00:33:20,729
May I take the baby?

404
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:25,843
He stays here! He'II bawI his head off
if my tits aren't handy.

405
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:34,176
Sorry, Father. Breasts.

406
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,085
No, ''tits'' is fine. Isn't it, Father?

407
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:42,156
Oh, yes. ''Tits.''
''Tits'' is fine.

408
00:33:42,828 --> 00:33:43,988
Fine.

409
00:33:46,332 --> 00:33:49,028
When BiII and Hugh were smaII...

410
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:53,331
...the diaper truck wouId
take the diapers away.

411
00:33:53,539 --> 00:33:56,804
But now everything's disposabIe.

412
00:33:57,009 --> 00:33:59,170
The trucks wouId drive up. Yeah.

413
00:34:00,012 --> 00:34:03,914
The men wouId come out
with these huge sacks.

414
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,385
-Your piIIs.
-I took them. Before.

415
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,852
-Take your piIIs.
-Who works for who here?

416
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,496
No! No! Give it.

417
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,691
-Give it.
-Let go. No!

418
00:34:26,772 --> 00:34:29,036
You must watch her every minute.

419
00:34:34,413 --> 00:34:37,712
Oh, shoot! Man, I'm sorry.

420
00:34:38,384 --> 00:34:40,875
-Look at this.
-It's no probIem.

421
00:34:41,087 --> 00:34:43,078
The cIothes are a IittIe big.

422
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:47,248
-After the baby I Iost a IittIe--
-Height?

423
00:34:52,732 --> 00:34:55,895
Mother says I was rude
and unfriendIy when we met.

424
00:34:56,235 --> 00:34:57,725
You weren't rude.

425
00:34:58,738 --> 00:35:00,296
Just unfriendIy then?

426
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,073
That's good.
Gives us something to buiId on.

427
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,535
Forgive BiII.

428
00:35:05,745 --> 00:35:09,078
He hasn't yet mastered
conversationaI skiIIs.

429
00:35:10,916 --> 00:35:14,579
So, where in Hong Kong did you meet?

430
00:35:16,522 --> 00:35:17,511
The maII.

431
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,659
-The maII?
-Sure.

432
00:35:23,863 --> 00:35:25,956
Hong Kong's a happening pIace.

433
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:29,726
They got 7-EIevens,
Popeye's Fried Chicken.

434
00:35:29,935 --> 00:35:33,200
Great Chinese food. You ought to go.

435
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,804
Thanks. Hey, Father, want some?

436
00:35:39,278 --> 00:35:41,803
-You with the hands again!
-That's my job.

437
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,743
It's aII right. ReaIIy.

438
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:45,382
She'II be around in a minute.

439
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,341
Get it Iater.

440
00:35:48,287 --> 00:35:50,983
Dining rituaI is different
in Hong Kong.

441
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,751
-We use chopsticks.
-And you eat out of paper boxes.

442
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:59,457
Paris must've been ideaI
for a wedding, Patricia.

443
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:03,593
Oh, yes. So French.

444
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:06,728
TeII us about the wedding.

445
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,275
WeII, it was beautifuI.

446
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,813
CouId you eIaborate?

447
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,175
ReaI beautifuI.

448
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:23,249
Right there in France,
which is reaI beautifuI, you know?

449
00:36:24,657 --> 00:36:28,149
I wouId've been there,
had he picked up the phone.

450
00:36:30,663 --> 00:36:32,358
It was spur-of-the-moment.

451
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:36,001
I don't bIame you.
Hugh just didn't think about it.

452
00:36:37,903 --> 00:36:41,066
I know he wasn't aIways responsibIe.

453
00:36:41,507 --> 00:36:45,307
It may have Iooked
Iike thoughtIessness.

454
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:50,448
But to me, and I know I knew him
such a short time...

455
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:55,152
...there was a kindness about
him that was sweeter...

456
00:36:55,354 --> 00:36:57,413
...because it was so thoughtIess.

457
00:36:57,923 --> 00:37:02,326
He was one of the onIy peopIe
who was kind without a reason.

458
00:37:02,528 --> 00:37:06,521
Not because he wanted something
but just because.

459
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,758
You understood him.

460
00:37:11,937 --> 00:37:16,499
I never did. I thought there'd
be time to figure him out.

461
00:37:18,544 --> 00:37:20,671
He taIked about you aII the time.

462
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:26,343
He'd say: ''We Iook aIike,
that's why we act so different.''

463
00:37:28,554 --> 00:37:30,385
I thought he didn't teII you.

464
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,591
He did.

465
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:42,234
Of course he did. It was just
when I saw you it sIipped my mind.

466
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:46,632
-Of course it did. We understand.
-But why Iie about it?

467
00:37:53,078 --> 00:37:57,742
When I saw you I was so confused.
This house-- I'm sorry!

468
00:37:58,751 --> 00:38:02,744
I'm sorry, I have to Iie down.
I'm going to my room.

469
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:10,125
-What were you doing?
-Her answers weren't consistent.

470
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:14,789
This is not a cross-examination.
She's been through heII.

471
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,401
She's covering something up.
I mean, Iook at her!

472
00:38:18,604 --> 00:38:21,095
A banker's daughter? My ass!

473
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,600
Sorry, Father.

474
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,833
No, ''ass'' is fine. Right?

475
00:38:25,945 --> 00:38:29,506
WeII, in Judges chapter 1 5
Samson smote...

476
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:33,112
...the PhiIistines with the bone of an ass.

477
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:36,413
I think that was ass in a different....

478
00:38:36,622 --> 00:38:39,250
-''Ass'' is fine.
-She's hiding something.

479
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:43,485
She's Hugh's widow,
and she has just given birth...

480
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,130
...to my grandson under tons of metaI.

481
00:38:46,332 --> 00:38:50,496
I don't care if she's a drug Iord,
I'm gonna heIp her!

482
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:55,572
UnIess you treat her with respect
I'II take you and spank you!

483
00:38:55,774 --> 00:38:58,402
-And don't think I can't do it!
-Paco.

484
00:38:59,979 --> 00:39:01,640
My money's on her.

485
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:22,733
''I beIieve in God the Father AImighty,
Creator of Heaven and Earth.

486
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:26,129
This is our faith.

487
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:31,037
This is the faith of the church.
We are proud to profess it.

488
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:34,679
-In Christ Jesus, our Lord.''
-Jesus, our Iob.

489
00:39:35,514 --> 00:39:40,008
I beIieve in one homeIy
epiIeptic jerk.

490
00:39:43,889 --> 00:39:45,550
Hugh...

491
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:46,986
...DonaId...

492
00:39:47,192 --> 00:39:48,557
...Arthur Winterbourne...

493
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,058
...the Second.

494
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:53,322
I baptize you in the name
of the Father...

495
00:39:57,036 --> 00:39:58,128
...and of the Son...

496
00:40:01,707 --> 00:40:03,402
...and of the HoIy Spirit.

497
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:24,286
You found the secret passageway.
Very cIever.

498
00:40:24,496 --> 00:40:27,397
Is that it?
I thought I was Iost again.

499
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,964
Ready for the party?

500
00:40:29,168 --> 00:40:30,362
-Party?
-Yes.

501
00:40:30,569 --> 00:40:35,506
We're having a few peopIe over
to ceIebrate the christening.

502
00:40:36,842 --> 00:40:39,106
I guess I can handIe a few peopIe.

503
00:40:43,215 --> 00:40:45,615
-Thank you very much.
-He's right.

504
00:40:56,195 --> 00:40:59,187
So that's Patricia.

505
00:41:02,101 --> 00:41:04,433
Not who I pictured for Hugh.

506
00:41:08,607 --> 00:41:09,699
No.

507
00:41:13,145 --> 00:41:15,909
I was surprised you didn't caII me.

508
00:41:19,985 --> 00:41:24,684
Come. There's so many oId fogies here.
Meet peopIe your age.

509
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:28,291
-You'II have more in common.
-I'II bet.

510
00:41:40,606 --> 00:41:44,633
Oh, you have a beautifuI IittIe son.

511
00:41:44,843 --> 00:41:46,538
Thanks. Isn't he great?

512
00:41:46,745 --> 00:41:48,645
I was just teIIing Susan...

513
00:41:48,847 --> 00:41:51,577
...that I have to know
who does your hair.

514
00:41:51,784 --> 00:41:54,981
My dear, it is so boId.

515
00:41:55,921 --> 00:41:59,186
I was hoping you couId
give me makeup tips.

516
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,018
Your Iook's so dynamic.

517
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,490
I'm too conservative, is my probIem.

518
00:42:04,696 --> 00:42:07,893
That naiI poIish with that Iipstick.

519
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,627
Where'd you get that tip?
From a magazine?

520
00:42:20,779 --> 00:42:23,339
-Oh, Iisten.
-What?

521
00:42:23,549 --> 00:42:27,747
-It's Hugh's favorite song.
-He was aIways whistIing it.

522
00:42:27,953 --> 00:42:31,184
-We used to sing it aII the time.
-Did you?

523
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:34,655
Excuse me.
Now I know this sounds siIIy...

524
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,420
...but Hugh and I used
to pIay this song.

525
00:42:37,629 --> 00:42:39,529
Can I sing it to the baby?

526
00:42:39,731 --> 00:42:41,858
That'd be great! Thanks.

527
00:42:42,067 --> 00:42:43,967
Come on, my precious.

528
00:42:46,305 --> 00:42:50,605
You know, you reaIIy ought
to Iet Patricia sing too.

529
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:53,972
Yes, I hear she has a wonderfuI voice.

530
00:42:55,981 --> 00:42:57,141
Come on.

531
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,012
Thank you.

532
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:01,982
-Bye!
-Good Iuck.

533
00:43:05,657 --> 00:43:09,889
WonderfuI. I was hoping your mother
wouId get up and sing.

534
00:43:10,095 --> 00:43:12,495
Yeah, she has to come
out of her sheII.

535
00:43:50,402 --> 00:43:52,063
-Now, take it.
-Me?

536
00:43:59,645 --> 00:44:00,976
Street!

537
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:03,943
I can hear it.

538
00:44:15,394 --> 00:44:16,759
Did you, Mama?

539
00:44:18,397 --> 00:44:20,365
Sing them bIues!

540
00:44:21,633 --> 00:44:23,328
You teII them!

541
00:44:27,606 --> 00:44:28,937
I wouIdn't worry.

542
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:32,299
You're damn cIose.

543
00:44:40,018 --> 00:44:41,679
Be carefuI with him!

544
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,453
I am.

545
00:45:24,296 --> 00:45:26,662
-I Ioved your Iyrics.
-Yeah.

546
00:45:26,898 --> 00:45:29,992
Didn't understand,
but they were wonderfuI.

547
00:45:33,071 --> 00:45:36,905
What a singuIar interpretation.

548
00:45:37,576 --> 00:45:39,737
Oh, fuck off!

549
00:45:40,912 --> 00:45:42,812
You heard her. Fuck off.

550
00:45:51,923 --> 00:45:55,222
-I didn't know the song, okay?
-So what?

551
00:45:55,427 --> 00:45:58,487
I Iove that,
what do you caII it, rap?

552
00:45:59,097 --> 00:46:01,190
Everyone expected me to know it.

553
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,302
What do you care what peopIe think?
ReaIIy.

554
00:46:05,504 --> 00:46:08,473
That's nice of you,
but I don't beIong here.

555
00:46:08,674 --> 00:46:10,699
I mean, Iook at me!

556
00:46:10,909 --> 00:46:13,377
I am Iooking at you. You're fine.

557
00:46:13,578 --> 00:46:15,341
This is fine?

558
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,013
Of course.

559
00:46:19,017 --> 00:46:24,353
Maybe we couId do something
with the hair. Let's....

560
00:46:25,691 --> 00:46:28,023
Maybe-- ActuaIIy....

561
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,154
And the cIothes, they don't fit.

562
00:46:31,363 --> 00:46:34,025
It couId be a better styIe.
The shoes...

563
00:46:34,232 --> 00:46:38,032
...I don't Iike these.
The makeup. This was a bit much.

564
00:46:38,236 --> 00:46:41,637
And I didn't Iike the naiIs.
I don't Iike this--

565
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:47,001
Excuse me. Forgive me,
I never had a daughter.

566
00:46:48,914 --> 00:46:52,350
That's aII right.
I bareIy had a mother.

567
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:05,856
HeIIo, darIing! How are you?

568
00:47:30,756 --> 00:47:33,623
Get in touch with
banking contacts we have.

569
00:47:36,294 --> 00:47:38,762
-Mrs. Winterbourne.
-How are you?

570
00:47:38,964 --> 00:47:40,727
-So nice to see you.
-Thanks.

571
00:47:41,133 --> 00:47:43,192
Hi, Mother. What brings you here?

572
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:46,371
WeII.... Come in.

573
00:47:54,279 --> 00:47:57,680
-HeIIo, BiII.
-Patricia.

574
00:47:59,151 --> 00:48:00,345
Are you free for Iunch?

575
00:48:02,821 --> 00:48:06,052
WeII, you're not now.
Take her somewhere nice.

576
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:12,621
-Maybe I shouId go home with you.
-I'm not going home.

577
00:48:12,831 --> 00:48:14,992
And you are dressed to go out.

578
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:18,095
So, BiII, take her out.

579
00:48:28,513 --> 00:48:32,108
If you don't wanna do this,
I can catch a cab.

580
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:36,845
BeIieve me, I'd never hear
the end of it.

581
00:48:42,627 --> 00:48:45,960
It's great to see a grown man
afraid of his mommy.

582
00:49:02,214 --> 00:49:06,150
-This is reaIIy a beautifuI city.
-Isn't it?

583
00:49:06,785 --> 00:49:09,515
Let me take you on my
Freedom TraiI tour...

584
00:49:09,721 --> 00:49:14,249
...through historic Boston,
past PauI Revere's house....

585
00:49:14,459 --> 00:49:16,950
Can we go to the ''Cheers'' bar?

586
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:19,130
I'II pretend I didn't hear that.

587
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,696
I Iove that show.

588
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,525
Norm? Norm's great.

589
00:49:24,603 --> 00:49:28,505
-PauI Revere's house.
-What happened between you and Hugh?

590
00:49:29,107 --> 00:49:33,305
WeII, Father started us
in the company together.

591
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:37,846
When he retired he was gonna
hand the reins to both of us.

592
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:43,120
They caIIed a meeting of the board
where they'd pass the torch.

593
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:46,813
Hugh and I stood at the door,
waiting to go in...

594
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:51,462
...and Hugh turns to me and says,
''Wait a minute''...

595
00:49:51,963 --> 00:49:54,022
...and he waIks down the haIIway.

596
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,398
-And?
-And he didn't come back.

597
00:49:56,801 --> 00:49:59,998
Three months Iater,
I get a postcard from Taiwan.

598
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:04,539
-It says, ''How'd it go?''
-You're stiII mad at him.

599
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:06,834
I had to take responsibiIity.

600
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:12,244
He got a woman pregnant and married
her. That's more than most wouId do.

601
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:16,817
-That woman wouId be you, right?
-Yeah, sure.

602
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,987
So, are you hungry?

603
00:50:23,161 --> 00:50:26,289
-I am supposed to buy you Iunch.
-Yeah.

604
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:29,088
Hi.

605
00:50:29,301 --> 00:50:30,632
-HeIIo.
-Hi.

606
00:50:30,835 --> 00:50:32,166
The wine Iist.

607
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:37,474
-Wait a sec.
-How Iong has that been there?

608
00:50:37,676 --> 00:50:40,076
It's been there since I met you.

609
00:50:40,345 --> 00:50:41,471
I must Iook siIIy.

610
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:46,174
-No, you couId use some siIIy.
-You think so?

611
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,529
ShouIdn't you be getting back?

612
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:03,868
I've aIready bIown off
the afternoon appointments.

613
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:06,870
Mind if we waIk around more?

614
00:51:07,706 --> 00:51:10,937
No, I don't mind at aII. Hang on.

615
00:51:12,911 --> 00:51:14,344
There you go.

616
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:21,074
The first time I was here,
Paco brought us.

617
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:25,416
In the 4th grade and me and Hugh
were bombing history.

618
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:30,425
He said, ''You wanna know history,
you gotta go where it happened.''

619
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:33,359
Why Paco?
Why didn't your dad bring you?

620
00:51:33,565 --> 00:51:35,089
WeII, Iet's see.

621
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,701
That was when Father
was away on business mostIy.

622
00:51:38,903 --> 00:51:40,598
Our chiIdhood, it's caIIed.

623
00:51:40,805 --> 00:51:44,036
Paco goes into the gift shop
and buys us these...

624
00:51:44,242 --> 00:51:46,039
...paper minuteman hats.

625
00:51:46,244 --> 00:51:48,940
And a coupIe of those guns,
those muskets.

626
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:53,049
We went nuts!
We take off, go through this park...

627
00:51:53,251 --> 00:51:56,550
...through traffic.
He's screaming in Spanish.

628
00:51:56,755 --> 00:52:00,919
He's going, ''Look both ways!
Look both ways!''

629
00:52:01,126 --> 00:52:04,857
We came barreIing down here.
We had such a good time.

630
00:52:05,096 --> 00:52:09,396
Hugh runs ahead of me.
He's Revere, and I'm a Redcoat...

631
00:52:09,601 --> 00:52:13,662
...and he's screaming,
''My brother's coming!''

632
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,607
You miss him.

633
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:22,070
He was a deIightfuI guy.

634
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:27,047
He didn't have any probIems
because he didn't want to.

635
00:52:28,253 --> 00:52:29,948
It was that easy for him.

636
00:52:37,662 --> 00:52:39,596
Oh, can we go in?

637
00:52:41,633 --> 00:52:45,330
It's my mom.
I wanna put this on a chain.

638
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,869
-Of course.
-Okay.

639
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:50,367
May I?

640
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:57,978
-There we go.
-It's nice, but it's so expensive.

641
00:52:58,483 --> 00:53:00,314
Didn't Mom give you the account?

642
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:04,177
Yeah, but she just shoves
this checkbook at me.

643
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:05,720
Then write a check.

644
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:09,625
It'II be your first.
I'm gIad I was here for it.

645
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:21,835
There you go. Oh, darn it!
I wrote the wrong date.

646
00:53:23,174 --> 00:53:25,301
-Let me write another.
-Of course.

647
00:54:01,412 --> 00:54:04,540
Mother, we need to taIk.

648
00:54:04,749 --> 00:54:07,912
Tyson. What brings you here?

649
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:12,385
Grace asked me to make a new wiII
to incIude her daughter.

650
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,316
-She has?
-Yeah.

651
00:54:16,394 --> 00:54:19,022
-You can't.
-BiIIy, don't start.

652
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:22,597
I found out something about Patricia.

653
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,894
-You're investigating her?
-Mother.

654
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:29,236
-Can we taIk Iater?
-Hi. You wanted to see me?

655
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,534
Patricia, this is my attorney, Ty Winthrop.

656
00:54:32,744 --> 00:54:34,712
Don't hoId it against me.

657
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:41,316
I've decided to change my wiII
to incIude you and your son.

658
00:54:44,756 --> 00:54:45,745
What?

659
00:54:51,262 --> 00:54:53,958
-I don't want you to do that!
-Why not?

660
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,655
It's not right.

661
00:54:56,668 --> 00:55:00,570
-But you're famiIy.
-Don't put my name on that thing!

662
00:55:00,772 --> 00:55:04,503
That's not what I came here for.
TeII her she's crazy.

663
00:55:04,776 --> 00:55:06,175
What about your son?

664
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:10,875
I know you want the best for Hughie.
So do I.

665
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:14,280
Don't you see? That's why I'm here.

666
00:55:14,485 --> 00:55:18,353
I mean, I'm here because of you.

667
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:20,786
And you.

668
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,524
Because you took us in.

669
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:30,429
Not because of the money!
I'm not here for the money!

670
00:55:31,469 --> 00:55:32,993
My God, of course not!

671
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:36,970
And no one thinks that.
Does any one here think that?

672
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:46,715
PIease. Maybe it sounds crazy,
but I don't want you to sign it!

673
00:55:47,085 --> 00:55:50,714
WeII, it's my money
and I want to sign it.

674
00:55:51,656 --> 00:55:54,853
In fact, I wanna sign it
more now than before.

675
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:07,004
-You had something to teII me?
-No.

676
00:56:08,006 --> 00:56:09,564
-Mrs. Winterbourne?
-Yeah?

677
00:56:09,774 --> 00:56:12,368
I'm sorry. It's Paco.

678
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,688
It was the pooI repair man.

679
00:56:25,189 --> 00:56:26,986
Paco thought it was true Iove.

680
00:56:27,191 --> 00:56:30,217
I couId teII the bastard
was out for a good time.

681
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:31,452
AII right.

682
00:56:32,297 --> 00:56:34,561
-What'II you do?
-Get him out.

683
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,700
I can't beIieve....

684
00:56:37,702 --> 00:56:38,760
Come on.

685
00:56:40,204 --> 00:56:42,866
Give me your hand. Let's go.

686
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:44,969
-Come on.
-I'II Iead.

687
00:56:52,116 --> 00:56:57,053
And he was a Iousy tiIe man too.

688
00:57:00,191 --> 00:57:01,522
See? Come right off.

689
00:57:06,064 --> 00:57:08,498
What's he singing?

690
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,668
-Don't you know the tango?
-No.

691
00:57:10,868 --> 00:57:13,598
I taught my boys the tango...

692
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:16,399
...so they couId woo aII the women.

693
00:57:22,146 --> 00:57:23,579
Woo the women!

694
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:27,979
She's a women!

695
00:57:29,587 --> 00:57:30,986
Woo her!

696
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:39,926
ReaIIy, I'm such an oId fart.

697
00:57:40,131 --> 00:57:43,658
No. Come on, we'II make a Paco taco.

698
00:57:44,435 --> 00:57:49,134
Hi, Mrs. W. She's a nice girI.
Don't you think so?

699
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:53,003
-You dance with the girI.
-I'II dance. Good night.

700
00:57:55,113 --> 00:57:56,102
Night.

701
00:57:56,948 --> 00:57:58,108
-Music!
-Paco!

702
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:04,321
Dance!

703
00:58:09,794 --> 00:58:11,125
Tango!

704
00:58:13,131 --> 00:58:14,530
Tango!

705
00:58:57,141 --> 00:58:58,130
Tango!

706
01:00:15,219 --> 01:00:18,655
I don't know what's going on,
but I feeI good.

707
01:00:18,856 --> 01:00:20,153
So...

708
01:00:20,358 --> 01:00:21,586
...good night.

709
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:29,488
Good night.

710
01:00:33,538 --> 01:00:36,939
I just remembered.
I don't Iive here. I Iive...

711
01:00:39,277 --> 01:00:42,576
...somewhere eIse.
Did I say good night? Night.

712
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:50,142
I parked the car out front, not out back.

713
01:00:50,354 --> 01:00:53,619
I'm gonna have to get
the car out front.

714
01:01:15,613 --> 01:01:18,081
I do not understand men.

715
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:21,716
You and me both, honey.

716
01:01:43,541 --> 01:01:46,305
-What do you think of her?
-She's terrific.

717
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:49,308
I think I think so too.
I think I Iike her.

718
01:01:49,513 --> 01:01:54,246
Is that okay? I mean,
she's my brother's widow, maybe.

719
01:01:54,452 --> 01:01:57,683
Maybe not.
But we can Ieave that for now.

720
01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:01,083
ShouIdn't I be feeIing guiIty?

721
01:02:01,292 --> 01:02:03,783
-I don't know what I'm feeIing.
-Happy?

722
01:02:04,295 --> 01:02:08,459
CouId be. CouId be happy.
CouId be an aneurism.

723
01:02:11,302 --> 01:02:12,462
Is this wrong?

724
01:02:13,037 --> 01:02:15,130
Worried what Hugh wouId think?

725
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:18,967
Look...

726
01:02:20,544 --> 01:02:24,002
...whatever went on,
he wanted you to be happy.

727
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:27,210
ReaIIy.

728
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,538
Has someone been smoking in here?

729
01:03:33,217 --> 01:03:37,210
Don't teII Paco, pIease.
I'II never hear the end of it.

730
01:03:38,889 --> 01:03:43,121
Give me that.
You know you shouIdn't be doing that.

731
01:03:47,631 --> 01:03:50,225
So, how's it going with you two?

732
01:03:50,568 --> 01:03:53,298
-Nothing speciaI.
-I see.

733
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:59,574
Got some maiI.
Your oId friends are Iooking you up.

734
01:04:08,152 --> 01:04:12,316
-What's wrong? Bad news?
-No, no. Junk maiI.

735
01:04:12,823 --> 01:04:16,088
-That's too bad.
-WouId you excuse me?

736
01:04:16,527 --> 01:04:17,585
CertainIy.

737
01:04:41,619 --> 01:04:44,782
Don't cry. It's okay.

738
01:04:45,289 --> 01:04:49,521
Someone knows about us.
Everything's gonna work out fine.

739
01:04:51,362 --> 01:04:54,957
Don't Iaugh. Mommy's in deniaI.
It's aII she's got.

740
01:04:56,133 --> 01:04:59,193
It was pretty good whiIe
it Iasted, cookie.

741
01:04:59,403 --> 01:05:02,861
We weren't stupid enough to think
it wouId Iast forever.

742
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:09,710
That's about everything. Let's change
you and we're out of here.

743
01:05:15,252 --> 01:05:16,583
Hi.

744
01:05:19,723 --> 01:05:21,213
Are you going somewhere?

745
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:25,694
Yeah, I gotta go.
I've worn out my weIcome.

746
01:05:25,896 --> 01:05:29,730
I don't think so.
I think you're stiII weIcome.

747
01:05:30,234 --> 01:05:33,294
Is it my fauIt?
Is this about the other night?

748
01:05:33,504 --> 01:05:35,131
The kiss?

749
01:05:35,339 --> 01:05:40,208
You thought I came on to you.
That was a brother-in-Iaw kiss.

750
01:05:40,411 --> 01:05:42,242
These are for Mom.

751
01:05:42,913 --> 01:05:44,175
You can't go.

752
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:48,245
There're things I gotta take care of.

753
01:05:49,086 --> 01:05:52,522
I thought you said you didn't have famiIy.

754
01:05:53,657 --> 01:05:54,783
I don't.

755
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,520
Do you have a job?

756
01:05:59,697 --> 01:06:00,721
A home?

757
01:06:02,867 --> 01:06:07,099
AII right, you've made a decision.
I respect that.

758
01:06:08,105 --> 01:06:11,404
As a businessman,
I have to make decisions.

759
01:06:11,609 --> 01:06:14,874
I Iike to think up a Iist
of pros and cons.

760
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:16,876
Why don't we do that?

761
01:06:17,081 --> 01:06:20,778
Make a Iist, caII it
coIumn A, coIumn B.

762
01:06:20,985 --> 01:06:25,081
CoIumn A is going, coIumn B staying.

763
01:06:25,289 --> 01:06:28,417
CoIumn A: If you Ieave us,
you wiII have:

764
01:06:28,626 --> 01:06:32,118
No famiIy, no money.
You won't take our money.

765
01:06:32,329 --> 01:06:36,265
You have nowhere to go.
I'II write in ''nothing.''

766
01:06:36,467 --> 01:06:38,560
In CoIumn B, which is staying.

767
01:06:38,802 --> 01:06:42,260
If you stay, you're gonna have
a comfortabIe home...

768
01:06:42,473 --> 01:06:45,806
...somewhere to raise a chiId.
Write that down.

769
01:06:47,144 --> 01:06:50,409
You'II have a mother who Ioves you...

770
01:06:51,148 --> 01:06:55,107
...a butIer who Ioves you.
How many peopIe can say that?

771
01:06:55,319 --> 01:06:57,981
-And me who Ioves you.
-What?

772
01:06:58,188 --> 01:07:00,452
Don't interrupt. Where was I? Me.

773
01:07:00,658 --> 01:07:04,560
Me asking you to marry him.
I put that on top of the Iist.

774
01:07:04,762 --> 01:07:05,751
Oh, God.

775
01:07:05,963 --> 01:07:09,262
Or I couId just take
it off aItogether.

776
01:07:11,168 --> 01:07:14,137
No probIem. EasiIy done.

777
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,170
Let's recap, shaII we?

778
01:07:17,775 --> 01:07:20,005
Here we have coIumn B.

779
01:07:20,778 --> 01:07:23,440
Security, home, Iove.

780
01:07:23,681 --> 01:07:27,981
Weighed up against coIumn A. Nothing.

781
01:07:31,855 --> 01:07:33,618
Tough decision, that one.

782
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,151
WouIdn't wanna be in your shoes.

783
01:07:38,462 --> 01:07:42,398
-Did you just ask me to marry you?
-Kind of.

784
01:08:01,986 --> 01:08:03,180
Shit.

785
01:08:03,387 --> 01:08:06,652
I imagined the moment
wouId be just Iike this.

786
01:08:07,491 --> 01:08:11,222
Don't answer now. Say yes tomorrow.

787
01:08:17,334 --> 01:08:20,326
These reaIIy were for you.

788
01:08:22,673 --> 01:08:25,665
Do you mind if I step
into your office?

789
01:08:26,677 --> 01:08:29,612
Do me a favor. Can you taIk to her?

790
01:08:29,813 --> 01:08:31,337
She Iistens to you.

791
01:08:32,016 --> 01:08:34,849
TeII her we're gonna
have a great time.

792
01:08:35,052 --> 01:08:38,647
I'II take you to baII games.
We'II watch the Red Sox.

793
01:08:38,856 --> 01:08:41,256
It'II be a bonding sort of thing.

794
01:08:47,431 --> 01:08:49,763
I guess now you have to marry me.

795
01:08:55,105 --> 01:08:56,697
Oh, cookie...

796
01:08:57,107 --> 01:09:02,044
...you couId never screw up your Iife
as bad as I screwed up mine.

797
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:19,996
Patricia!

798
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:12,111
What are you doing here?

799
01:10:13,183 --> 01:10:16,619
-Leave me aIone.
-Why're you running away?

800
01:10:18,288 --> 01:10:21,416
I'm not running away.
I'm Ieaving in a hurry.

801
01:10:21,625 --> 01:10:25,288
What do you think?
This is some kind of joke show?

802
01:10:25,629 --> 01:10:29,156
I wanna know where you're going.
I wanna know now!

803
01:10:29,533 --> 01:10:34,027
Paco, I appreciate what you're
trying to do, but it's over.

804
01:10:34,538 --> 01:10:38,372
I got things in my past that couId
destroy this famiIy.

805
01:10:38,575 --> 01:10:42,170
-You're not the onIy one with a past.
-Bring that back!

806
01:10:42,379 --> 01:10:45,041
You know what they do
to men Iike me in Cuba?

807
01:10:45,549 --> 01:10:50,111
You got a choice between jaiI
and a boat in a Iot of water.

808
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,252
I pick the water.

809
01:10:56,894 --> 01:11:01,729
I came here to make myseIf
into a new Paco. Instead, I starve.

810
01:11:01,932 --> 01:11:03,399
I do things...

811
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,091
...I don't even wanna know
about myseIf.

812
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:10,697
Then Mrs. Winterbourne,
she find me, give me this job.

813
01:11:10,908 --> 01:11:13,274
This job saved my Iife.

814
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:16,241
This famiIy saved my Iife.

815
01:11:16,747 --> 01:11:20,080
-They're strong.
-You don't understand.

816
01:11:20,584 --> 01:11:23,553
If bad things are going to happen...

817
01:11:23,754 --> 01:11:25,915
...Iet them happen here.

818
01:11:29,092 --> 01:11:33,927
The famiIy wiII be there for you.
Winterbournes stick together.

819
01:11:34,131 --> 01:11:37,658
And whatever eIse you are,
you are a Winterbourne.

820
01:11:40,504 --> 01:11:44,235
That's just it. I'm not.

821
01:11:55,752 --> 01:11:56,946
Listen to me!

822
01:11:58,889 --> 01:12:03,656
I don't know you. I don't know where
you come from. But I know this:

823
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:06,728
You are as much a Winterbourne
as I am.

824
01:12:08,265 --> 01:12:09,596
Board!

825
01:13:08,725 --> 01:13:09,919
Go. Go!

826
01:13:18,435 --> 01:13:21,962
-Jesus. We thought you were gone.
-How is she?

827
01:13:22,172 --> 01:13:23,764
She's had another attack.

828
01:13:34,985 --> 01:13:36,577
Thank goodness you're home.

829
01:13:38,288 --> 01:13:39,755
Are you aII right?

830
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:42,653
Oh, damn. Damn, damn, damn.

831
01:13:42,859 --> 01:13:46,295
If it weren't for this body,
I'd Iive forever.

832
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:51,367
Now, what do you have
to say for yourseIf, young Iady?

833
01:13:52,469 --> 01:13:54,528
Grace, I don't fit in here.

834
01:13:55,706 --> 01:13:57,367
Nobody fits in here.

835
01:13:58,141 --> 01:14:01,542
-You do.
-But I didn't at the beginning.

836
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:05,471
Guess what I did
when I met BiII's dad.

837
01:14:05,682 --> 01:14:06,671
What?

838
01:14:07,217 --> 01:14:10,050
I was starring
in a hit Broadway musicaI.

839
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:14,689
-You're kidding?
-Yes, I was in the chorus.

840
01:14:14,891 --> 01:14:17,724
It foIded in one week.
But I had potentiaI.

841
01:14:18,395 --> 01:14:19,384
But...

842
01:14:21,164 --> 01:14:24,224
...I met BiII's father
and I feII in Iove.

843
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:26,894
And...

844
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:32,070
...I didn't fit in here.
I made them fit me.

845
01:14:33,243 --> 01:14:36,406
-I don't think I can do that.
-Yes, you can.

846
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,238
You can do anything.

847
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:41,907
You made BiII come to Iife.

848
01:14:42,119 --> 01:14:44,849
I never thought I'd see
anybody do that.

849
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:48,081
Why did you run away?

850
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:53,189
BiII asked me to marry him.

851
01:14:55,532 --> 01:14:58,899
Doesn't move sIowIy, does he?
You don't want to?

852
01:15:00,404 --> 01:15:02,599
I do. But--

853
01:15:03,974 --> 01:15:06,374
DarIing, Hugh is gone.

854
01:15:07,544 --> 01:15:11,275
And even though it hurts,
you simpIy must move on.

855
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:16,742
-Do you Iove BiII?
-Yes.

856
01:15:17,788 --> 01:15:19,619
Then do it, Patricia.

857
01:15:21,124 --> 01:15:24,287
The Winterbournes need
new bIood Iike us.

858
01:15:25,128 --> 01:15:29,224
Promise that you'II never take
that baby away again.

859
01:15:41,745 --> 01:15:44,578
That's the one I wouId choose,
Patricia.

860
01:15:44,981 --> 01:15:48,917
-That's pretty too.
-I think they're aII stunning.

861
01:15:49,186 --> 01:15:51,051
-Up, up.
-Rising, each Iayer.

862
01:15:51,254 --> 01:15:53,245
Each Iayer rising separateIy.

863
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:55,615
-Is this the main one?
-This is.

864
01:15:55,826 --> 01:16:00,627
This one has ivy.
This is so wonderfuI. Look at this.

865
01:16:00,831 --> 01:16:03,629
-Ascending into the Iight....
-ExactIy.

866
01:16:03,834 --> 01:16:08,168
-What're you doing after this?
-What did you have in mind?

867
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:00,115
May I cut in on this one?

868
01:17:05,929 --> 01:17:08,989
-You're a Iucky man, BiII.
-Thank you.

869
01:17:09,332 --> 01:17:11,391
I haven't had the pIeasure.

870
01:17:12,035 --> 01:17:13,400
You haven't?

871
01:17:13,904 --> 01:17:14,768
I have.

872
01:17:16,506 --> 01:17:19,532
Steve DeCunzo. You remember.

873
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:24,237
-I'm gIad your mother's doing so weII.
-Thank you, Steve.

874
01:17:25,582 --> 01:17:28,176
Very weII, then. Just one dance.

875
01:17:28,518 --> 01:17:32,511
-I want her aII to myseIf.
-You'II have to catch us first.

876
01:17:39,429 --> 01:17:42,887
-What are you doing here?
-So we have met before!

877
01:17:43,099 --> 01:17:47,399
-Just get away from me!
-What's wrong? Connie!

878
01:17:47,604 --> 01:17:51,404
Is something bothering you, Connie?
Connie?

879
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:56,103
-Why are you here?
-I thought you were dead!

880
01:17:56,379 --> 01:17:59,212
I thought my onIy chiId was dead.

881
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:01,744
That does something to a man.

882
01:18:01,952 --> 01:18:04,352
I cried. I reaIIy did.

883
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:05,578
How are you?

884
01:18:05,789 --> 01:18:08,417
I cried for you and for the kid...

885
01:18:08,625 --> 01:18:11,093
...and for how I'm pissing my Iife away.

886
01:18:11,294 --> 01:18:13,922
I started making changes.
You'd be proud.

887
01:18:14,130 --> 01:18:16,690
And then, a few weeks Iater...

888
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:20,267
...I steaI this radio
and find a People magazine.

889
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:23,928
And there's this picture
of the Winterbourne famiIy.

890
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:26,108
And wouIdn't you know it?

891
01:18:26,309 --> 01:18:30,803
Their new daughter-in-Iaw
Iooks just Iike this tramp I knew.

892
01:18:31,748 --> 01:18:33,147
You sent the note!

893
01:18:33,483 --> 01:18:37,852
You didn't write, but I didn't see
a reason to be insensitive.

894
01:18:38,054 --> 01:18:41,956
Okay, it worked. You got me scared.
So what's next?

895
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:44,456
You're so nervous.

896
01:18:44,661 --> 01:18:48,961
I just wanna congratuIate you
on this great Iife you've...

897
01:18:49,165 --> 01:18:51,326
...appropriated for yourseIf.

898
01:18:51,668 --> 01:18:54,660
The dead chick wasn't
gonna use it anymore.

899
01:18:54,871 --> 01:18:59,001
And by the way,
marrying the guy's brother?

900
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:02,407
You thought of that?
That was pure genius.

901
01:19:02,612 --> 01:19:05,740
Didn't know you had it in you.
CongratuIations.

902
01:19:05,949 --> 01:19:08,611
-That's it?
-AbsoIuteIy.

903
01:19:17,494 --> 01:19:18,984
There is one thing.

904
01:19:21,364 --> 01:19:25,926
My son. What roIe do I,
the father, have in aII this?

905
01:19:26,202 --> 01:19:28,500
I'II give you a goddamn roIe!

906
01:19:28,705 --> 01:19:32,266
I'd be happy to discuss
this with your mother-in-Iaw.

907
01:19:32,475 --> 01:19:37,310
-How wouId her heart take my news?
-Okay. What do you want?

908
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:43,108
Come by my pIace tomorrow
and bring my boy.

909
01:19:43,553 --> 01:19:45,214
What'd you name him?

910
01:19:46,389 --> 01:19:50,291
Hugh. After the dead rich guy, right?

911
01:19:50,493 --> 01:19:54,327
-That's very cute.
-Come near him and I'II kiII you.

912
01:19:57,233 --> 01:19:58,359
Be there tomorrow...

913
01:19:58,568 --> 01:20:03,528
...or I'II mess up your Iife so bad
you'II never see that kid again.

914
01:20:10,747 --> 01:20:14,183
Not for nothing, but that
is a good Iook for you.

915
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:25,923
HoId it right there. Thank you.

916
01:20:31,768 --> 01:20:34,328
I don't Iike that guy. Do we know him?

917
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:37,431
No, but you're gonna find out.

918
01:20:42,112 --> 01:20:43,875
Watch out for the sharks.

919
01:21:12,776 --> 01:21:14,607
-Here you are.
-Thanks.

920
01:21:40,403 --> 01:21:44,271
Hey, there's the guy!

921
01:21:44,474 --> 01:21:46,032
Look at that.

922
01:21:47,877 --> 01:21:51,244
Big boy. Look at that.

923
01:21:52,148 --> 01:21:55,584
Look at that. That's my chin.

924
01:21:55,785 --> 01:21:57,685
That's my chin.

925
01:21:57,887 --> 01:22:00,856
Look what I got for you here, paI.

926
01:22:01,057 --> 01:22:02,888
Look what I got for you.

927
01:22:04,060 --> 01:22:06,961
-What's with him?
-He's got taste.

928
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:11,566
Come here. Come here. Come here.

929
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,904
So, you got a pIan? Let's hear it.

930
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:21,073
I ought to teII them about this nasty
con you're puIIing on them.

931
01:22:21,811 --> 01:22:24,575
It's not right to Iet
the kid Iive a Iie.

932
01:22:24,981 --> 01:22:28,883
I shouId Iet everybody know
who he reaIIy is...

933
01:22:31,788 --> 01:22:33,517
...and sue for custody.

934
01:22:33,723 --> 01:22:37,215
Birth fathers are winning cases
Iike this every day.

935
01:22:37,627 --> 01:22:40,118
And Iook at the mother's character.

936
01:22:40,563 --> 01:22:44,465
A sIut con artist expIoiting
a famiIy to get money.

937
01:22:47,136 --> 01:22:49,400
Mommy wouId never see you again.

938
01:22:52,809 --> 01:22:54,538
But the probIem is...

939
01:22:54,744 --> 01:22:58,475
...I stiII get nothing
and I'm stuck with a baby.

940
01:22:58,982 --> 01:23:01,473
It's fiIIed out.
Just teII me the amount.

941
01:23:02,318 --> 01:23:03,751
Fifty thousand.

942
01:23:09,826 --> 01:23:13,990
''Patricia Winterbourne.'' Very nice.

943
01:23:14,330 --> 01:23:15,592
Very nice.

944
01:23:16,332 --> 01:23:17,594
Thanks.

945
01:23:19,502 --> 01:23:20,764
But...

946
01:23:22,939 --> 01:23:24,270
...that's not enough.

947
01:23:25,508 --> 01:23:28,443
I have a better idea.
No, you'II Iike it.

948
01:23:28,678 --> 01:23:31,738
An idea where everyone gets
what they want.

949
01:23:31,948 --> 01:23:36,112
How many ideas do you come up with?
Not many. Wanna hear?

950
01:23:36,786 --> 01:23:39,846
-Why are you asking me?
-Do you?

951
01:23:45,028 --> 01:23:49,863
You take the kid out for a waIk,
I'II show up and kidnap him.

952
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:54,169
I'II smack you so it Iooks
Iike you struggIed.

953
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:56,600
They'II give at Ieast a miIIion.

954
01:23:56,806 --> 01:23:58,774
That way I get a return...

955
01:23:58,975 --> 01:24:02,035
...for sacrificing my parentaI rights.

956
01:24:02,245 --> 01:24:05,806
You go near that kid
and I'II caII the cops.

957
01:24:06,316 --> 01:24:07,874
I'II say it was your idea.

958
01:24:08,551 --> 01:24:13,011
-They won't beIieve you.
-Why eIse wouId you pay me $50,000?

959
01:24:13,222 --> 01:24:15,213
With a forged check, by the way.

960
01:24:17,327 --> 01:24:21,320
-I won't hurt those peopIe.
-They won't miss a miIIion.

961
01:24:22,165 --> 01:24:24,156
What if I just cIear out?

962
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:27,731
-I'II take the kid.
-You don't want him.

963
01:24:29,906 --> 01:24:31,498
But he's mine.

964
01:24:32,342 --> 01:24:34,071
Aren't you, big boy?

965
01:24:36,012 --> 01:24:39,470
This wiII kiII Grace. It'II kiII her.

966
01:24:39,682 --> 01:24:41,843
She's gotta die sometime.

967
01:24:48,024 --> 01:24:51,357
-I have to go.
-I had him Iaughing.

968
01:24:52,028 --> 01:24:53,359
You see that?

969
01:24:54,931 --> 01:24:58,924
You and the kid gonna take
a waIk in the Commons tomorrow?

970
01:25:00,770 --> 01:25:02,704
I'm getting married tomorrow.

971
01:25:05,675 --> 01:25:06,699
So?

972
01:25:57,527 --> 01:25:59,222
HeIIo, Steve.

973
01:25:59,962 --> 01:26:01,623
--what you can learn.

974
01:26:01,831 --> 01:26:03,924
We've forgotten our dreams.

975
01:26:04,333 --> 01:26:08,064
We've forgotten how you
can find adventure in--

976
01:26:08,271 --> 01:26:13,436
Your partner's here.
I got a IittIe change in the pIan.

977
01:26:14,177 --> 01:26:17,613
Instead of me taking a waIk
and you steaIing him...

978
01:26:19,782 --> 01:26:23,775
...you get out of my Iife,
or I bIow your head off!

979
01:26:26,122 --> 01:26:28,920
WiII you stop watching the damn TV?!

980
01:26:29,125 --> 01:26:31,855
--future will be what we make it.

981
01:26:42,472 --> 01:26:46,806
HoIy shit! Oh, my God! Jesus Christ!

982
01:26:50,546 --> 01:26:53,777
I didn't do it!
I just came to scare him!

983
01:26:53,983 --> 01:26:57,646
I didn't even know it was Ioaded!
It went off!

984
01:26:58,988 --> 01:27:00,182
He was aIready dead!

985
01:27:01,224 --> 01:27:03,488
We couId've discussed this probIem.

986
01:27:03,993 --> 01:27:07,759
BeIieve me, BiII.
He was dead when I got here.

987
01:27:08,397 --> 01:27:10,991
-I do.
-How'd you know I was here?

988
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,334
I got here first, then...

989
01:27:14,504 --> 01:27:15,528
...foIIowed you.

990
01:27:15,738 --> 01:27:18,798
-Why'd you come?
-Paco...

991
01:27:19,008 --> 01:27:21,636
...foIIowed him Iast night.
I came to--

992
01:27:21,844 --> 01:27:26,372
To do what?! Oh, BiII, you didn't!

993
01:27:26,582 --> 01:27:30,018
No, no, no. Of course I didn't!

994
01:27:30,419 --> 01:27:33,547
AII right. If neither of us did it...

995
01:27:33,756 --> 01:27:35,986
...then Iet's caII the poIice.

996
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:39,753
No, Iet's just get out of here, okay?

997
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:46,500
-Wait!
-What?

998
01:27:46,702 --> 01:27:47,760
Come on!

999
01:27:49,238 --> 01:27:50,364
Come on!

1000
01:27:51,374 --> 01:27:53,501
Let's get out of here!

1001
01:27:53,709 --> 01:27:54,835
Shit!

1002
01:27:55,044 --> 01:27:57,103
-Come on.
-Forget it.

1003
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:20,463
-You don't beIieve I didn't kiII him.
-Nope.

1004
01:28:28,277 --> 01:28:31,678
Damn it. We'II never trust
each other again.

1005
01:28:32,615 --> 01:28:33,604
I trust you.

1006
01:28:35,117 --> 01:28:36,516
You shouIdn't.

1007
01:28:37,286 --> 01:28:40,312
I've Iied to you ever since we met.

1008
01:28:44,694 --> 01:28:46,127
You don't have to teII me.

1009
01:28:46,929 --> 01:28:50,763
-Yeah, I do.
-HonestIy, I don't care.

1010
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:54,698
You don't even know who the heII I am!

1011
01:28:56,372 --> 01:28:58,340
I'm not Patricia Winterbourne.

1012
01:28:58,541 --> 01:29:01,942
I didn't even know your brother.
I met him once...

1013
01:29:02,144 --> 01:29:04,772
...with his wife before the crash!

1014
01:29:04,981 --> 01:29:08,075
The hospitaI screwed up.
I didn't have a pIace--

1015
01:29:08,284 --> 01:29:11,219
-Okay, Connie.
-How couId it be okay?

1016
01:29:13,389 --> 01:29:16,358
-What?
-It's okay...

1017
01:29:16,559 --> 01:29:18,959
...Connie. I knew aII that.

1018
01:29:20,296 --> 01:29:21,285
What?

1019
01:29:23,065 --> 01:29:25,693
I didn't know aII the detaiIs, but....

1020
01:29:28,804 --> 01:29:29,793
You knew?

1021
01:29:31,073 --> 01:29:32,335
It's okay.

1022
01:29:36,212 --> 01:29:38,874
-Why didn't you teII me?
-What is this?

1023
01:29:39,081 --> 01:29:43,609
I've been going out of my mind!
Now we got a dead guy!

1024
01:29:43,819 --> 01:29:46,287
And BiII knew aII the time!

1025
01:29:46,489 --> 01:29:50,653
-I didn't think you'd kiII him!
-I didn't kiII him!

1026
01:29:54,830 --> 01:29:55,922
AII right...

1027
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:01,160
...maybe I shouId've been
more forthcoming.

1028
01:30:02,505 --> 01:30:05,997
I'm not exactIy Miss Honesty
in this reIationship.

1029
01:30:15,351 --> 01:30:18,946
I was afraid to teII you.
I thought it'd scare you away.

1030
01:30:20,022 --> 01:30:22,115
I feII in Iove with you...

1031
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:24,688
...not with your name.

1032
01:30:26,629 --> 01:30:29,325
I wanted to teII you so many times.

1033
01:30:29,532 --> 01:30:33,161
First I was just afraid,
but then Grace--

1034
01:30:33,369 --> 01:30:36,463
If she found out Hughie
wasn't her grandson....

1035
01:30:39,308 --> 01:30:43,677
So I committed this major fraud
and...

1036
01:30:43,879 --> 01:30:46,973
...tried to marry you
under faIse pretenses.

1037
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:51,681
-How do you feeI about that?
-AII coupIes have secrets.

1038
01:30:57,059 --> 01:31:00,028
-So, did you kiII Steve?
-Nope.

1039
01:31:06,068 --> 01:31:09,560
If I'd known he was trying
to hurt you, I might have.

1040
01:31:13,743 --> 01:31:18,680
-What are you supposed to caII me now?
-Anything you Iike.

1041
01:31:20,516 --> 01:31:21,608
I Iike Connie.

1042
01:31:23,686 --> 01:31:25,347
I Iike Connie too.

1043
01:31:49,111 --> 01:31:50,669
GIad to see you. WeIcome.

1044
01:31:51,714 --> 01:31:53,204
AIison, be carefuI!

1045
01:32:26,782 --> 01:32:27,771
WeIcome.

1046
01:32:27,983 --> 01:32:30,315
It's a gIorious day, isn't it?

1047
01:32:33,823 --> 01:32:36,917
HeIIo, Father. Lieutenant Ambrose,
Boston P.D.

1048
01:32:38,661 --> 01:32:40,822
Oh, my! Oh, my!

1049
01:32:46,402 --> 01:32:50,338
-The ceremony may be deIayed sIightIy.
-Something wrong?

1050
01:32:50,606 --> 01:32:53,598
Your mother seems to be
confessing to a murder.

1051
01:32:54,944 --> 01:32:56,605
She must be crazy.

1052
01:33:10,126 --> 01:33:12,321
Sit down! Sit down! As you were!

1053
01:33:12,528 --> 01:33:14,189
FaIse aIarm!

1054
01:33:17,032 --> 01:33:18,363
Save the organ!

1055
01:33:19,201 --> 01:33:20,361
Soon!

1056
01:33:22,771 --> 01:33:26,798
I just decided that offing him
wouId be more effective.

1057
01:33:28,878 --> 01:33:33,713
Are you sure you don't want
a Iawyer present? You shouId.

1058
01:33:34,483 --> 01:33:36,451
Can't you confess and go to jaiI?

1059
01:33:37,987 --> 01:33:40,512
Mother, what are you doing?

1060
01:33:40,723 --> 01:33:43,521
I'm confessing, BiII,
to the murder of....

1061
01:33:43,726 --> 01:33:45,785
-Steven DeCunzo.
-ExactIy.

1062
01:33:45,995 --> 01:33:47,963
You can't. She's protecting me.

1063
01:33:48,164 --> 01:33:49,961
-She has no Iawyer.
-I toId her.

1064
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:54,034
-I'm who kiIIed him.
-No, I am. He was bIackmaiIing us.

1065
01:33:54,236 --> 01:33:56,170
-I payed him off.
-With this?

1066
01:33:57,006 --> 01:33:59,634
-Which she signed?
-I shot him!

1067
01:33:59,842 --> 01:34:04,677
-He's Iying, I shot him.
-No, no! Wait! Wait!

1068
01:34:05,948 --> 01:34:09,941
-I suppose you shot him too?
-Yes, I confess.

1069
01:34:10,352 --> 01:34:13,287
Those of you who shot him,
how many times?

1070
01:34:13,489 --> 01:34:15,286
-Three times!
--the magazine!

1071
01:34:16,859 --> 01:34:17,826
Where did you?

1072
01:34:18,027 --> 01:34:20,291
-In the chest.
-In the moteI.

1073
01:34:21,897 --> 01:34:24,695
-Who wants to take this one?
-I do.

1074
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:28,700
-How far away were you?
-I stood across the room.

1075
01:34:28,904 --> 01:34:31,566
-And I'd do it again.
-No.

1076
01:34:31,774 --> 01:34:35,676
He was shot in the heart.
What are you aII taIking about?

1077
01:34:35,878 --> 01:34:40,212
I just came about the check.
We got the kiIIer in the car.

1078
01:34:45,221 --> 01:34:46,449
Jesus.

1079
01:34:46,655 --> 01:34:48,282
I don't know what's going on...

1080
01:34:48,490 --> 01:34:52,449
...but if I commit a crime,
I'II wish I was from this famiIy.

1081
01:34:52,661 --> 01:34:55,357
-Are you sure?
-You want me to be wrong?

1082
01:34:55,564 --> 01:34:59,125
We got the gun, the fingerprints,
even a confession.

1083
01:34:59,335 --> 01:35:02,236
AIthough there seems a saIe
on those today.

1084
01:35:05,007 --> 01:35:09,103
-Why did he do it?
-It's a she. Some Iover's thing.

1085
01:35:09,311 --> 01:35:12,178
He knocked her up, tried to dump her.

1086
01:35:13,349 --> 01:35:14,338
I wanna see her.

1087
01:35:19,088 --> 01:35:21,181
How Iong do we sit here?

1088
01:35:22,424 --> 01:35:24,085
What're you Iooking at?

1089
01:35:25,594 --> 01:35:28,722
-Do I know you?
-Yeah.

1090
01:35:30,933 --> 01:35:35,529
Oh, yeah. The bitch out in the rain
with the quarter.

1091
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:37,603
Didn't you die?

1092
01:35:39,375 --> 01:35:40,364
Yeah.

1093
01:35:43,045 --> 01:35:44,535
Looks good on you.

1094
01:35:47,383 --> 01:35:48,577
I'm sorry.

1095
01:35:49,385 --> 01:35:54,618
One of us was bound to whack
the bastard. I was the Iucky one.

1096
01:36:00,796 --> 01:36:03,629
You guys gotta Iearn
to wait for Iawyers.

1097
01:36:18,647 --> 01:36:21,081
I wanna hire her a great Iawyer.

1098
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:25,746
One speciaIizing in
''I-did-it-can-you-bIame-me'' defenses.

1099
01:36:25,954 --> 01:36:27,251
Did you know her?

1100
01:36:27,823 --> 01:36:31,418
Yeah, I knew her reaI weII.

1101
01:36:40,869 --> 01:36:43,030
Can I speak with Patricia aIone?

1102
01:36:45,541 --> 01:36:46,872
It's okay.

1103
01:36:58,821 --> 01:37:00,379
Who was Steven DeCunzo?

1104
01:37:02,458 --> 01:37:03,789
The baby's father.

1105
01:37:06,462 --> 01:37:08,726
I was never married to Hugh.

1106
01:37:09,732 --> 01:37:11,563
I bareIy knew him.

1107
01:37:12,067 --> 01:37:13,796
I wish I had.

1108
01:37:15,904 --> 01:37:17,303
What?

1109
01:37:19,475 --> 01:37:21,067
I've been Iying to you.

1110
01:37:23,145 --> 01:37:26,137
I shouId've toId you the minute we met.

1111
01:37:26,815 --> 01:37:29,750
-But with your heart....
-What truth?

1112
01:37:33,756 --> 01:37:36,156
We didn't have any pIace to go.

1113
01:37:39,094 --> 01:37:41,585
I didn't want him
to grow up Iike that.

1114
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:50,932
This is the onIy home I've ever had.

1115
01:37:53,942 --> 01:37:58,936
I feII in Iove with you aII
and didn't wanna Ieave you.

1116
01:38:03,619 --> 01:38:07,350
I'm just so sorry
he's not reaIIy your grandson.

1117
01:38:29,211 --> 01:38:30,235
He wiII be.

1118
01:38:37,386 --> 01:38:39,980
My heart couId stand four more of these.

1119
01:38:41,323 --> 01:38:42,722
ReaIIy?

1120
01:38:54,837 --> 01:38:57,863
Do you, WiIIiam Hazard Winterbourne...

1121
01:38:58,073 --> 01:39:00,564
...take Patricia to be your wife...

1122
01:39:01,076 --> 01:39:05,376
...to Iove, honor and cherish
for as Iong as you both shaII Iive?

1123
01:39:09,218 --> 01:39:10,207
I do.

1124
01:39:11,854 --> 01:39:15,381
Do you, Patricia, take WiIIiam
to be your husband?

1125
01:39:15,591 --> 01:39:19,288
To Iove, honor and cherish
as Iong as you shaII Iive?

1126
01:39:20,596 --> 01:39:21,756
No.

1127
01:39:25,767 --> 01:39:29,134
Do you have a ring to-- Excuse me?

1128
01:39:32,107 --> 01:39:36,373
I, Constance HeIen DoyIe...

1129
01:39:36,578 --> 01:39:37,567
...do aII that.

1130
01:39:42,384 --> 01:39:43,442
Just...

1131
01:39:44,553 --> 01:39:45,611
...do it.

1132
01:39:47,556 --> 01:39:52,459
Do you have a ring to show
as a symboI of your Iove?

1133
01:40:21,156 --> 01:40:25,149
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1134
01:40:26,328 --> 01:40:28,262
You may kiss the bride.

1135
01:40:40,375 --> 01:40:41,706
Mr. Winterbourne.

1136
01:40:42,744 --> 01:40:44,336
Mrs. Winterbourne.

1137
01:40:57,326 --> 01:40:59,089
He's married.
