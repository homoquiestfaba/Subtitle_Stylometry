1
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,511
Trevor!

2
00:01:13,523 --> 00:01:14,820
Max.

3
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:43,543
Whoa, whoa.

4
00:01:45,454 --> 00:01:48,981
Although Wegener was ridiculed
by the scientific community...

5
00:01:49,158 --> 00:01:51,126
...he was eventually found
to be correct...

6
00:01:51,294 --> 00:01:54,320
...in his theory of an original
supercontinent called Pangaea.

7
00:01:55,898 --> 00:01:57,490
Yeah. Okay.

8
00:02:03,072 --> 00:02:06,633
Ah. Come to papa.

9
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,705
Hey, Leonard.

10
00:02:09,278 --> 00:02:11,212
Hey, man.

11
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,577
- Dude, you ain't gonna be happy.
- Why?

12
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,048
- It's Kitzens.
- I see.

13
00:02:17,653 --> 00:02:20,645
- Hello.
- Trevor, there's my favorite colleague.

14
00:02:20,823 --> 00:02:22,154
- How are you, Alan?
- I'm good.

15
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:24,589
- How's that Con Drift class of yours going?
- Fine.

16
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,354
Does it get echoey in there
with so few students?

17
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:31,366
So, what do you got on the books?
I'm busy.

18
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:34,731
No, no, I can see how busy you are.

19
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:38,101
So I'll try to be
as quick as possible here.

20
00:02:38,274 --> 00:02:41,835
The university is pulling the plug
on your brother's lab.

21
00:02:42,011 --> 00:02:43,035
Pulling the plug?

22
00:02:43,212 --> 00:02:46,113
Yeah, it's gonna finally give us
all the storage space we need.

23
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:49,217
Let's get something straight here,
this facility is dedicated...

24
00:02:49,385 --> 00:02:53,287
...to the research of Maxwell Anderson's
theories predicting the volcanic fissures...

25
00:02:53,456 --> 00:02:55,014
Which have never been proven.

26
00:02:55,191 --> 00:03:00,288
I mean, how many of your late brother's
sensors are even still active? One, two...?

27
00:03:00,463 --> 00:03:01,930
- Three.
- It used to be 29.

28
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,066
This is the wrong time to shut us down.

29
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:09,000
I have got seismic activity in Bolivia.
I got a 13 millimeter shift in Mongolia.

30
00:03:09,171 --> 00:03:11,366
Alan, you can't shut us down.
Keep the lab open.

31
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,943
- It's all I've got left of Max.
- It's been 10 years since Max, Trevor.

32
00:03:16,712 --> 00:03:20,409
I am sorry about all this. I really am.

33
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:35,659
<i>Trevor, are you there? It's Elizabeth.</i>

34
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:37,059
<i>Pick up, please.</i>

35
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:41,567
<i>Okay. Well, uh, we are on the 95,</i>
<i>and we're heading your way.</i>

36
00:03:41,737 --> 00:03:44,001
<i>You wanna say hi</i>
<i>to your Uncle Trevor, Sean?</i>

37
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:45,834
<i>No.</i>

38
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:47,600
<i>Just say hello.</i>
- No.

39
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:50,302
<i>I don't want to.</i>
- Oh, no.

40
00:03:51,113 --> 00:03:52,740
<i>Hey, it's your sister-in-law again.</i>

41
00:03:52,915 --> 00:03:55,247
<i>Just wanted to make sure</i>
<i>what time you'd be home...</i>

42
00:03:55,418 --> 00:03:57,181
<i>... because we'll be there around 6.</i>

43
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,144
<i>Okay. Well, we'll be on my cell.</i>

44
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,189
- Oh, boy.
- <i>Sean's looking forward to seeing you.</i>

45
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:03,825
- <i>Right, Sean?</i>
- <i>Negatory.</i>

46
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,791
<i>I'm getting worried that</i>
<i>we might've gotten our signals crossed.</i>

47
00:04:06,963 --> 00:04:08,123
<i>Please call me.</i>

48
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:10,829
<i>I'm not home. Leave me a message.</i>

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,867
<i>Trevor, we're pulling up</i>
<i>in front of your building.</i>

50
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,679
Trevor, you in there?

51
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,708
Hi.

52
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,146
- Hey.
- How are you, Elizabeth?

53
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:34,687
- Oh, you're home.
- It's so good to see you.

54
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,256
You too.

55
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:40,326
- How are you? I just got your messages.
- Uh-huh.

56
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:43,590
- You forgot, didn't you?
- I didn't forget.

57
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:45,028
How could I forget?

58
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,691
- You didn't forget?
- I...

59
00:04:49,772 --> 00:04:52,036
I forgot.
It doesn't mean I haven't been...

60
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,199
...looking forward
to time with my nephew.

61
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,242
I haven't seen him since he was 9?

62
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:58,710
- Seven.
- Wow. Ha-ha.

63
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,111
So how long
is he gonna be staying again?

64
00:05:01,717 --> 00:05:03,844
- Ten days.
- Is that what we said?

65
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,114
Hey, Sean. How are you?

66
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,016
Looking good.

67
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:12,424
- Is that one of those Game Boys?
- It's a PSP.

68
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:16,793
- Cool.
- Sean, get up, say hi to your uncle.

69
00:05:18,934 --> 00:05:20,697
Hi to your uncle.

70
00:05:22,204 --> 00:05:26,641
Last time I saw you,
you were about this high.

71
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:29,573
- Oh! Ha-ha.
- Yeah, good one.

72
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:33,807
You got that?
Okay, you've got all my numbers.

73
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:36,281
You've got your ticket
and passport in your bag.

74
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:38,477
I will be there to pick you up in Ottawa.

75
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:42,454
And by then I'll have found us a house
and we can start on this big new adventure.

76
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,616
- Pretty exciting stuff, huh?
- Yeah, it's great.

77
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:47,661
We get to be Canadians. Thrilling, eh?

78
00:05:49,865 --> 00:05:51,059
Just let yourself in.

79
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:56,232
- It will be good for him, being with you.
- Yeah.

80
00:05:56,405 --> 00:05:58,464
Who knows?
Maybe it will be good for you too.

81
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:05,408
This is for you.

82
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:06,741
What...? Is this Sean's?

83
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,816
No, it's Max's.

84
00:06:08,984 --> 00:06:11,350
- Max's?
- Yeah.

85
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:31,596
So, hey, dude. This is gonna be fun.

86
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:33,207
A couple of dudes hanging out.

87
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,842
Five days, maybe a week.

88
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,501
You know, doing dude stuff,
what dudes do.

89
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:40,707
You like baseball?
You know what we should do?

90
00:06:40,883 --> 00:06:42,612
We should go get in a batting cage.

91
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:46,516
Yeah, okay, listen.
I don't like this any more than you do.

92
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:48,884
As long as you keep stocked
with Mountain Dew...

93
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:51,822
...and TiVo <i>Family Guy,</i>
we'll get along fine.

94
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,519
- Sure.
- Oh, wow.

95
00:06:54,697 --> 00:06:57,063
- That's an awesome coin collection.
- Oh.

96
00:06:57,233 --> 00:07:00,669
Well, kind of a pet project of mine.

97
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:04,795
- Yeah, it's really nifty.
- Thanks.

98
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:07,336
You hungry?
We could order in, you know.

99
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,105
Maybe some pizza, Chinese, Thai food?

100
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,872
Subs? Or something like that?

101
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:17,885
- Wow.
- What's that?

102
00:07:18,154 --> 00:07:24,582
Well, it's a box of possessions
of a really great guy.

103
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,250
Your dad.

104
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:30,827
His old ball glove.

105
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,264
Mom doesn't talk about him very much.

106
00:07:34,436 --> 00:07:36,131
Well, you can take my word for it.

107
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:38,637
He was one of those few people...

108
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:43,540
...who are just exceptional
at everything they do.

109
00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:50,350
Ooh. You see this?
This was your old man's PSP.

110
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:53,118
- A yo-yo?
- Don't be dissing the yo-yo.

111
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:55,883
This is physics at work.
You got your centrifugal force.

112
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,720
Your gravitational pull,
you got your potential energy.

113
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:00,691
And in ancient times, did you know...

114
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:04,026
...that this was actually used
as a hunting implement?

115
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,224
Watch.

116
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:12,101
- Hey, here, let me try.
- Yeah, you should probably take it.

117
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:19,204
I have no idea what this is.

118
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,576
Hello.

119
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,357
This was his favorite book.

120
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:33,558
Jules Verne's
<i>A Journey to the Center of the Earth.</i>

121
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:38,460
You know, I think that was
on my summer reading list once.

122
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:42,900
- I never got to it.
- That's too bad, it's a good read.

123
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:47,771
To him, it wasn't just science fiction,
it was inspiration.

124
00:08:48,577 --> 00:08:51,978
He used to read this to me
when I was a really little kid.

125
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,081
Hello. What are these notes?

126
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:09,656
"Magma temperatures reach 1150
in Mongolia"?

127
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:12,433
"Bolivia."

128
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:14,765
"Hawaii."

129
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:18,704
Look out!

130
00:09:26,081 --> 00:09:28,606
Hey, Sean, let's go check out my lab.

131
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:31,314
So it couldn't wait for tomorrow?

132
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:35,446
"Tectonophysics is the science of now,
not tomorrow."

133
00:09:35,624 --> 00:09:38,149
It's about seismic events
that occur in an instant.

134
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,192
Here, look at this.

135
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:45,131
You got Hawaii, Bolivia, Mongolia.

136
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:48,634
And the conditions today are almost
exactly what they were in July '97.

137
00:09:48,804 --> 00:09:50,931
What's the big deal about July '97?

138
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:53,700
Sean, that was the year
that your dad went missing.

139
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:57,039
Now, look, you see this column
of numbers here?

140
00:09:57,613 --> 00:10:02,107
If the 753, right here, was a 752,
then it would be...

141
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:11,084
Exactly the same.

142
00:10:13,128 --> 00:10:16,325
What do these little blips mean?

143
00:10:16,498 --> 00:10:19,490
Don't touch anything.
Those little blips are my life's work.

144
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:22,068
These four little blips
are your entire life's work?

145
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:24,666
Three. Three little blips.

146
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:30,869
One, two, three, four.

147
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:37,042
Iceland.

148
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,948
This makes sense.

149
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:42,249
Max saw the readings 10 years ago,
and he took off to investigate.

150
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:45,882
Now, if the readings are the same today
as they were then...

151
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:48,621
...this may be my only chance
to find out what happened.

152
00:10:48,797 --> 00:10:50,856
- I'm gonna need your passport.
- For what?

153
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:54,400
I'm sorry, I have to get you to Canada
a little earlier than we planned.

154
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,333
What are you talking about?

155
00:10:56,505 --> 00:11:01,067
I'm talking about this.
<i>A Journey to the Center of the Earth.</i>

156
00:11:02,277 --> 00:11:06,714
It's all set in Iceland,
which is where he must've gone.

157
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:08,948
These are all my dad's notes?

158
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:13,777
Look...

159
00:11:17,192 --> 00:11:18,591
...Max and l...

160
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:23,721
Your dad and I were talking about
the possibility of volcanic tubes existing...

161
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:27,494
...that went down past the mantle,
towards the center of the Earth.

162
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:29,933
And that's what I think
he went looking for.

163
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,306
Sorry, I gotta put you on a flight
to Ottawa in the morning.

164
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:35,500
- And I'm calling Icelandair.
- No, no, look.

165
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:38,343
- Hey.
- I just got here, okay?

166
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:40,106
You're not gonna go and ditch me.

167
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:44,878
I was the person who found your life's work
fourth little blip thingy in the first place.

168
00:11:45,053 --> 00:11:47,544
- This is my brother we're talking about.
- It's my dad.

169
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:50,783
Now, I don't have to be in Ottawa
for 10 days. I'm going with you.

170
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,450
Know how much to book
a last-minute flight to Reykjavík?

171
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,392
Something tells me you got it covered.

172
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:12,843
"Descend, bold traveler,
into the crater of the jokul of Sneffels...

173
00:12:13,015 --> 00:12:16,610
...which the shadow of Scartaris touches
before the kalends of July...

174
00:12:16,785 --> 00:12:18,980
...and you will attain
the center of the Earth."

175
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:20,782
Ooh.

176
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:22,884
Sorry.

177
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:28,893
What are you doing?

178
00:12:29,064 --> 00:12:32,124
I'm deciphering these notations
that your father made in this book.

179
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:34,826
I think there's a code
behind the pairing of letters.

180
00:12:35,003 --> 00:12:37,494
It might have something to do
with the periodic table.

181
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,641
For instance, I've got S-A, I-S, G-G.

182
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:44,003
I believe that P-B is on the periodic table
and that's plumbum.

183
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:48,309
- Plumbum means lead.
- What's "Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson"?

184
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:50,042
What?

185
00:12:50,385 --> 00:12:53,081
Well, it's right here. Read it down.
Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson.

186
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,619
Oh. Uh...

187
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:59,784
Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson, that's...

188
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,021
That's a clue. Maybe that's a place.

189
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:05,496
It could be a thing.

190
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:08,469
- What are you doing?
- I am Googling at 30,000 feet.

191
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:12,004
- Are you supposed to be doing that?
- Welcome to the 21 st century.

192
00:13:12,174 --> 00:13:14,665
- Okay. Here.
- It's a person.

193
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:17,036
"Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson,
executive director...

194
00:13:17,212 --> 00:13:19,772
...of Ásgeirsson Institute
for Progressive Volcanology."

195
00:13:19,948 --> 00:13:21,438
Max would've known this guy.

196
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:26,452
I knew it was a good thing to bring you.
His institute has gotta be our first stop.

197
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,322
Are we there yet?

198
00:13:33,495 --> 00:13:36,589
If you mean annoying, yeah, we're there.

199
00:13:37,132 --> 00:13:40,158
- You know, you're going kind of slow.
- I'm going kind of safe.

200
00:13:40,335 --> 00:13:42,929
I just saw a goat in the passing lane.

201
00:13:43,105 --> 00:13:45,164
When's the whole adventure thing
gonna begin?

202
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,069
Let me give you something fun to do.

203
00:13:47,843 --> 00:13:49,743
Navigate.

204
00:13:50,445 --> 00:13:51,810
Where are we?

205
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:57,441
Have we passed Havanschlicht?

206
00:13:57,619 --> 00:14:00,019
- Havanschlicht?
- Yeah.

207
00:14:00,188 --> 00:14:02,281
I don't know.

208
00:14:02,457 --> 00:14:04,618
Have we passed Eingarsstadir?

209
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:06,317
- I don't know.
- Reynivír?

210
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:07,894
- I don't know.
- Húsavík?

211
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:09,325
No.
- Grundarhol?

212
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:11,796
No.
- Stifflarschtarder?

213
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,161
Stifflardschtarder?

214
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:17,772
How about Koldukardarskinoquue?
- What?

215
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,006
We're definitely lost.
- We're not lost.

216
00:14:21,176 --> 00:14:22,541
Just look for an institution.

217
00:14:22,711 --> 00:14:27,273
What's an institution look like?
- I don't know, it looks big and institutional.

218
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,781
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

219
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:35,112
Hey, look, there's a little shack up there.
We can stop there and ask for directions.

220
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,952
- We're not lost.
- Oh, no, definitely not.

221
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:46,061
What's this? A ski shack?

222
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:48,128
"Ásgeirsson...

223
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,435
...lnstitute for Progressive Volcanology."

224
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:53,040
I told you I'd find it.

225
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,607
Alrighty.

226
00:14:54,776 --> 00:14:58,007
- Not too shabby.
- All right.

227
00:15:01,183 --> 00:15:05,051
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't speak Icelandic.

228
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,158
- Hi, can I help you?
- Hello.

229
00:15:12,928 --> 00:15:14,862
- I'm Hannah.
- Oh, how do you do? Hi.

230
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:20,058
I'm Trev... Professor Anderson.
I'm visiting from America. Um...

231
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:23,537
- This is Sean, my nephew.
- I'm Sean.

232
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,666
Hi, Sean.

233
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:29,208
I was wondering if I could
possibly speak with, forgive me here...

234
00:15:29,378 --> 00:15:31,243
...Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson?

235
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,447
Um...

236
00:15:33,615 --> 00:15:35,810
Well, Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson is dead.

237
00:15:36,618 --> 00:15:39,178
- Dead?
- Yeah, he died three winters ago.

238
00:15:39,354 --> 00:15:40,685
Oh. Uh...

239
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,448
So do you run the institute?

240
00:15:42,624 --> 00:15:44,558
Nobody does. There is no institute.

241
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:49,060
- There's a sign down the road that says...
- Progressive volcanology was a failed idea.

242
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:52,894
Like, you know, the Berlin Wall
and eight-track tapes.

243
00:15:53,435 --> 00:15:54,902
I see.

244
00:15:55,637 --> 00:15:57,002
Well, did you work with him?

245
00:15:57,172 --> 00:15:59,037
No, no. He was my father.

246
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,375
Yeah? I know it. What about it?

247
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:10,211
Well, this book belonged
to my late brother, Max.

248
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:11,409
Max Anderson?

249
00:16:11,586 --> 00:16:16,285
We believe that he may have been
in contact with your father.

250
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,450
- Your brother was a Vernian.
- What's a Vernian?

251
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:23,223
Someone that believes that the writings
of Jules Verne were actual fact.

252
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,800
I mean, the guy
was a science fiction writer.

253
00:16:26,968 --> 00:16:30,699
And yet this society of believers
regarded Verne like a visionary.

254
00:16:30,872 --> 00:16:33,739
My father
was the biggest Vernian of them all.

255
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,275
My brother was no Vernian.

256
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,245
This was my father's copy.

257
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:49,083
Take a look.

258
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:56,088
See, the markings are exactly the same.
Your brother was a Vernian.

259
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,601
Wow, my dad was kind of out there.

260
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,968
- You didn't know him, Sean.
- I'm starting to think you didn't either.

261
00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:08,769
He was no member
of some secret society.

262
00:17:09,377 --> 00:17:13,074
- What are you guys doing here?
- I'm a scientist, I'm a professor.

263
00:17:13,248 --> 00:17:16,945
I'm here because there are seismic sensors
going off 30 klicks north of here...

264
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,087
...that we think
that we should check into.

265
00:17:19,254 --> 00:17:21,848
And that's the reason that we're here,
plain and simple.

266
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,281
Okay.

267
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:26,791
You know,
there are no roads to the north.

268
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,554
Well...

269
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,494
I'm a mountain guide.
I can take you there, professor.

270
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,829
- Great.
- That's great, I love hiking.

271
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:36,698
- I would appreciate that. That'd be great.
- Good.

272
00:17:37,606 --> 00:17:40,074
- Call me Trevor.
- You can call me Sean.

273
00:17:40,242 --> 00:17:42,608
So it will be 5000 kronur to go up there.

274
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:44,507
Five grand a day? No problem.

275
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:46,305
An hour.

276
00:17:48,183 --> 00:17:50,413
Do you accept rolls of quarters?

277
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,846
Come on, boys.
I wanna be home by sundown.

278
00:18:24,085 --> 00:18:26,918
Hey, you think you can slow down
a little bit, please?

279
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:36,088
- Dibs.
- What?

280
00:18:36,731 --> 00:18:38,699
I got dibs on the mountain guide.

281
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,067
- You're 13.
- Sorry, called it.

282
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,232
- Thirteen-year-olds don't get dibs.
- Get over it.

283
00:18:57,686 --> 00:18:59,017
We're getting closer.

284
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:03,188
All right, just watch your step there.
Mount Sneffels is deceptively treacherous.

285
00:19:03,358 --> 00:19:06,555
- What's Sneffels?
- Well, why don't you tell him, professor?

286
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:11,188
Sneffels is the name of the mountain
where this character Liedenbrock...

287
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:15,029
...apparently found a portal
to the center of the Earth.

288
00:19:15,203 --> 00:19:17,728
Let's just find that sensor of yours,
professor.

289
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,874
There it is.

290
00:19:20,842 --> 00:19:22,036
Yes.

291
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,405
Well, what do you need to do with it?

292
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:27,070
I gotta unlock it.
It's got, like, a black box...

293
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:31,814
...that has recorded
all of the seismic activity...

294
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:34,080
...that's transpired in the last 10 years.

295
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,655
Could tell me a lot about Max.

296
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:38,823
And what he was doing
when he went missing.

297
00:19:38,994 --> 00:19:41,485
Trevor, I'm really sorry,
we're gonna have to go now.

298
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:42,823
Must be corroded.

299
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:45,763
Trevor, we need to... Whoa.

300
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:53,303
Okay, we need to take cover.
Come on, Sean. Right now.

301
00:19:53,475 --> 00:19:54,499
I'll be right there.

302
00:19:54,676 --> 00:19:57,770
- Trevor, just leave it for now.
- I've almost got it.

303
00:19:58,546 --> 00:19:59,911
We need to take cover now.

304
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:03,980
Come on. Trevor.

305
00:20:04,152 --> 00:20:05,983
- Uncle Trevor.
- Get in here.

306
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:10,253
- Yes. Oh!
- Watch out.

307
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:11,585
Hurry up. Come on.

308
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,691
Trevor,
the sensor's attracting the lightning.

309
00:20:15,864 --> 00:20:18,856
- Drop it. Drop the sensor.
- What? I'm not gonna drop it.

310
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:22,367
Hurry!
- It's attracting the lightning!

311
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:41,679
Trevor?

312
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,020
- Trevor?
- I'm all right.

313
00:20:49,664 --> 00:20:50,961
Sean?

314
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:54,831
- Sean, you all right?
- I'm good.

315
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:05,602
- Okay, everybody, just stay calm.
- Guys, come on, you gotta help me dig.

316
00:21:06,514 --> 00:21:08,277
Come on.

317
00:21:14,322 --> 00:21:17,018
- Forget it, it's no use.
- Forget it?

318
00:21:19,894 --> 00:21:21,054
She's right.

319
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:26,861
There must be about 60 or 70 tons
of boulders on top of us.

320
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,765
Take us about a month
to dig out of here.

321
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,008
- We have to find another way.
- What if there is no other way?

322
00:21:34,175 --> 00:21:36,666
There's always another way, Sean.

323
00:21:38,513 --> 00:21:39,571
What else have you got?

324
00:21:39,748 --> 00:21:44,879
Signal flares, first aid, some rope, blankets
and a couple of protein bars.

325
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,145
But they're on a ration.

326
00:21:46,321 --> 00:21:50,485
- Don't know how long we'll be trapped for.
- Trapped? Is that what we are?

327
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:54,721
She... No, she didn't mean that.

328
00:21:55,997 --> 00:21:59,330
- Sean, hey, what are you doing?
- God, I'm not getting any service.

329
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:02,128
Sean, you're not gonna get any signal
down here, okay?

330
00:22:02,303 --> 00:22:04,897
Put this away.
Okay, don't worry about it.

331
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:08,236
- We'll find another way out, all right?
- Okay.

332
00:22:09,644 --> 00:22:11,737
One of these
might snake back to the surface.

333
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,437
How do we know which one to take?

334
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,850
My gut says we go right.

335
00:22:17,018 --> 00:22:18,417
Come on.

336
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,057
Looks promising.

337
00:22:30,832 --> 00:22:34,359
Just put one foot in front of the other.
We'll be out of here in no time.

338
00:22:36,504 --> 00:22:38,768
Looking good.

339
00:22:40,975 --> 00:22:44,877
Don't worry, direction is my sixth sense.

340
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,414
Pay attention, Sean.
It's just like doing field work.

341
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:50,949
I used to love doing field work.

342
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,312
- Watch out.
- Ah!

343
00:23:07,569 --> 00:23:09,833
You're not studying rocks in a lab,
professor.

344
00:23:10,004 --> 00:23:13,462
- This is life or death here.
- Yeah, thanks.

345
00:23:14,609 --> 00:23:16,668
You owe me one.

346
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:32,487
What does this say?

347
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,061
That means keep out.

348
00:23:37,232 --> 00:23:40,429
- Maybe that's decent advice.
- No, no. This is great news.

349
00:23:40,602 --> 00:23:43,969
This might lead us to an old mine shaft
and that could be our way out.

350
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:47,233
- How deep do you think it is?
- Can you give me one of those flares?

351
00:23:47,408 --> 00:23:50,468
Thank you. Sean, look at your watch.

352
00:23:50,645 --> 00:23:53,011
I'm gonna light this
and drop it over the edge...

353
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:56,241
...and I want you to tell me
how many seconds pass before it stops.

354
00:23:56,417 --> 00:23:57,679
Okay.

355
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,153
Here we go. Three, two...

356
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,849
Oh, God!

357
00:24:13,168 --> 00:24:14,499
What?

358
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:16,432
What was that?

359
00:24:26,147 --> 00:24:28,047
Yup, magnesium.

360
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,551
Must run in veins
all through these walls.

361
00:24:31,252 --> 00:24:34,085
Magnesium is kind of flammable,
isn't it, professor?

362
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:38,081
Yeah, used in flares,
used in gun powder, matchsticks.

363
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:42,923
Right, well, maybe gun powders and flares
aren't such a good idea down here.

364
00:24:46,534 --> 00:24:47,865
Thank you.

365
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:49,264
It's the same principle.

366
00:24:50,705 --> 00:24:53,674
- You ready, Sean?
- Yeah, go ahead.

367
00:24:53,841 --> 00:24:56,366
Three, two...

368
00:24:57,779 --> 00:24:59,212
One.

369
00:25:00,648 --> 00:25:01,672
Two.

370
00:25:03,017 --> 00:25:04,609
Almost three.

371
00:25:05,286 --> 00:25:07,618
Thirty-two squared by... It's 200 feet.

372
00:25:09,023 --> 00:25:10,354
That's no problem.

373
00:25:10,525 --> 00:25:14,120
It's about your basic 20-story high-rise.

374
00:25:14,295 --> 00:25:16,627
- You got enough rope?
- I always have enough rope.

375
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:18,891
Well, no problem for what?

376
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:20,329
Rappelling down in there.

377
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:22,800
We're gonna rappel down
that deep, dark hole?

378
00:25:22,971 --> 00:25:24,734
What, you got a problem with that?

379
00:25:24,906 --> 00:25:26,567
- Pfft.
- What's the matter?

380
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:28,936
There's no way
we should be rappelling down.

381
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,443
What are you talking about? You're
man enough to call dibs on the guide.

382
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,605
- But not enough to climb down a rope.
- Guys.

383
00:25:34,782 --> 00:25:38,411
- Calling dibs on the mountain guide...
- No one gets dibs on the mountain guide.

384
00:25:40,154 --> 00:25:41,280
We're going down there.

385
00:25:44,726 --> 00:25:47,559
Steady, steady.

386
00:25:48,196 --> 00:25:50,562
Remember, we're all connected.

387
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:53,425
It's okay.

388
00:25:55,403 --> 00:25:57,030
Looking good.

389
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,908
It's all good down here.

390
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:03,267
Way down here.

391
00:26:03,444 --> 00:26:04,911
You guys are coming down, right?

392
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:08,446
All right, Sean, I'm gonna start
lowering you down really, really slowly.

393
00:26:08,616 --> 00:26:12,347
So just lean back
and keep your feet up high.

394
00:26:14,622 --> 00:26:15,816
You're okay, Sean.

395
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,891
We're tethered together,
so nothing bad is gonna happen.

396
00:26:19,694 --> 00:26:21,525
Yeah, sure.

397
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:23,896
Good.

398
00:26:28,036 --> 00:26:29,526
Sean, keep walking.

399
00:26:29,704 --> 00:26:31,899
You have to keep walking.

400
00:26:33,641 --> 00:26:35,131
Good.

401
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,176
Hey, you're looking pretty good there.

402
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,474
- Sure you haven't done this before?
- Shut up.

403
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,715
Hey, you mind?
Watch your step, will you?

404
00:26:44,886 --> 00:26:46,581
I'm hanging on for my life here.

405
00:26:47,889 --> 00:26:50,323
Okay, Sean,
just make conversation with me.

406
00:26:51,592 --> 00:26:53,992
So, Hannah, do you come here often?

407
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:55,521
Oh, give me a break.

408
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,222
That can't be the best line
you can come up with.

409
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:02,165
- I'm making conversation with her.
- No, Sean, I do not come here very often.

410
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,262
Ready?

411
00:27:12,847 --> 00:27:13,871
Hey.

412
00:27:14,415 --> 00:27:16,110
Look at all this schist.

413
00:27:16,284 --> 00:27:17,979
- What?
- It's a metamorphic rock.

414
00:27:18,152 --> 00:27:20,950
Green schist, garnet schist,
mica-garnet schist.

415
00:27:21,122 --> 00:27:24,580
- Oh. Schist.
- It's everywhere, look at it. I guess...

416
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:28,528
Trevor.

417
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:37,194
Get to the wall, Trevor.
- I can't.

418
00:27:37,372 --> 00:27:40,705
- I can't, the walls widen out down here.
- Your rope is caught on mine.

419
00:27:40,975 --> 00:27:43,239
You're gonna take us down.
I gotta cut you loose.

420
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,537
What?
- Hannah, no.

421
00:27:44,712 --> 00:27:46,873
Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait.

422
00:27:47,048 --> 00:27:48,037
- Don't.
- Don't, don't, don't.

423
00:27:48,216 --> 00:27:49,342
- Uncle Trevor.
- Ah!

424
00:27:58,092 --> 00:28:00,617
Hey, guys, found it.

425
00:28:00,795 --> 00:28:02,228
The bottom's right here.

426
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:06,260
Hey, Hannah, you knew that, right?

427
00:28:07,001 --> 00:28:08,400
Right?

428
00:28:08,803 --> 00:28:10,031
Hannah?

429
00:28:19,046 --> 00:28:22,140
Guys, what's this?

430
00:28:26,254 --> 00:28:28,245
Looks like
an abandoned mine tunnel to me.

431
00:28:28,423 --> 00:28:30,983
That's Old Bla'gils Mine.

432
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:34,355
It was shut down 60 years ago
after the big disaster.

433
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:35,928
Disaster?

434
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,857
How big?

435
00:28:38,032 --> 00:28:39,431
Eighty-one dead.

436
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,624
That's pretty big.

437
00:28:41,936 --> 00:28:42,960
Come on.

438
00:28:43,538 --> 00:28:45,301
Cowboy up.

439
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,470
Hey, Trevor,
was there a mine like this in the book?

440
00:28:50,244 --> 00:28:52,337
No, don't think so.

441
00:28:54,182 --> 00:28:55,706
- Hannah?
- Yup?

442
00:28:55,883 --> 00:28:57,874
Can I ask you something?

443
00:28:58,052 --> 00:29:04,548
Do you wonder if your father
and my brother weren't wrong?

444
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,226
Let me make something very clear
to you.

445
00:29:08,863 --> 00:29:10,228
I am not my father.

446
00:29:10,865 --> 00:29:14,301
And the world that he belonged to
has nothing to do with me.

447
00:29:14,469 --> 00:29:15,731
I understand, of course.

448
00:29:15,903 --> 00:29:18,463
I didn't mean to say that it was
or that it would be...

449
00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:22,370
- You know I'm still on the clock, right?
- You're still billing me?

450
00:29:22,543 --> 00:29:26,309
I bill you until I'm safe in my house.

451
00:29:27,915 --> 00:29:30,782
- Huh.
- Hannah?

452
00:29:35,223 --> 00:29:36,952
What's that?

453
00:29:37,258 --> 00:29:40,250
- This is the old generator for the mine.
- Hey, you don't want to touch that.

454
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,762
What are you doing?

455
00:29:43,931 --> 00:29:46,456
There might be some
volatile compounds there, you know.

456
00:29:46,634 --> 00:29:49,569
- Serious generator.
- Hannah, that thing could blow up.

457
00:29:49,737 --> 00:29:50,795
Stop throwing switches.

458
00:29:50,972 --> 00:29:52,439
Don't do that. No, wait.

459
00:29:52,607 --> 00:29:54,097
Get away from that thing.

460
00:30:03,017 --> 00:30:05,417
Okay, I take it back.

461
00:30:11,192 --> 00:30:14,559
This is it, right? I mean, the miners,
they had to get their stuff out somewhere.

462
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,959
Yeah.
- These tracks could lead us out.

463
00:30:17,331 --> 00:30:19,765
Hey, Hannah, how many miners got out?

464
00:30:20,768 --> 00:30:22,201
One.

465
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,968
That's a start. I call front.

466
00:30:25,473 --> 00:30:26,804
What? No, no, no.

467
00:30:26,974 --> 00:30:28,271
Come on, don't get in there.

468
00:30:28,442 --> 00:30:30,273
We don't even know
if these things work.

469
00:30:30,444 --> 00:30:31,468
They're not safe.

470
00:30:31,646 --> 00:30:33,978
The tracks might not be safe.

471
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,752
Track ahead looks good. Get in.

472
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:54,324
Hey, Sean, it doesn't look safe.
I wouldn't do that.

473
00:30:54,502 --> 00:30:57,665
I think I see something. It's...

474
00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:00,972
Please tell me it's daylight.
Otherwise, I don't wanna know.

475
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:03,066
Uh...

476
00:31:03,244 --> 00:31:06,008
No, it's not daylight.

477
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,410
Oh, we're in deep schist.

478
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,458
I wish there were seat belts
on this thing.

479
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,719
You're worried about seat belts?

480
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:32,563
- Whoa!
- Ah!

481
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,105
Watch it.

482
00:31:45,052 --> 00:31:47,452
- Hannah.
- I know.

483
00:31:47,622 --> 00:31:49,988
- Pull the brake, pull the brake.
- No, don't.

484
00:31:50,157 --> 00:31:51,351
We won't make it.

485
00:32:02,737 --> 00:32:04,534
Yeah.

486
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,198
Hey, great job. Thanks.

487
00:32:09,744 --> 00:32:12,508
Guys.
- Stay put, Sean.

488
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,515
Trevor, you okay?

489
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:28,492
Hannah, your track ends.

490
00:32:29,597 --> 00:32:31,087
Jump in my car.

491
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:32,793
What?

492
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:35,094
Quick, you have to do it.

493
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:37,260
- Just jump.
- I know that.

494
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,603
Ready? Ah!

495
00:32:47,248 --> 00:32:49,580
Trevor, your track ends too.

496
00:32:54,321 --> 00:32:56,346
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

497
00:32:56,824 --> 00:32:59,349
Showing the proper way
to save someone's life. Come on.

498
00:32:59,527 --> 00:33:00,721
- Can I help?
- Okay.

499
00:33:05,232 --> 00:33:06,722
Ready?

500
00:33:21,315 --> 00:33:23,476
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

501
00:33:23,651 --> 00:33:25,949
Luckily, I had a soft landing.

502
00:33:29,457 --> 00:33:31,857
That's two you owe me now.

503
00:33:32,293 --> 00:33:35,456
- Who's keeping count?
- I am.

504
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,830
That was awesome.

505
00:33:45,206 --> 00:33:47,834
- What happened to you guys?
- Don't ask.

506
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,672
What's that?

507
00:33:57,451 --> 00:33:59,351
Where are you going? Don't go in there.

508
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,216
What are you guys talking about?
This could be our way out.

509
00:34:04,425 --> 00:34:06,586
There's a hole in the wall.

510
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:08,661
Guys, check it out.

511
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,400
Rubies.

512
00:34:14,568 --> 00:34:16,297
Emeralds.

513
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,062
Feldspar.

514
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,967
Uh, guys, there's more.

515
00:34:35,055 --> 00:34:36,682
Diamonds.

516
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:38,982
Bling.

517
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:47,464
Crystals are frequently formed
and found...

518
00:34:48,335 --> 00:34:52,567
...in volcanic tubes.

519
00:34:59,446 --> 00:35:01,744
This tube could take us back up, right?

520
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:03,975
- Uh-huh.
- We're not far from the surface.

521
00:35:04,151 --> 00:35:06,847
- Uh-uh.
- When we get out, I'm getting a Maserati.

522
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:11,253
Money is not the only thing that matters,
Sean. People matter too, you know.

523
00:35:11,425 --> 00:35:14,861
- Something like that.
- Not if you have a Maserati.

524
00:35:17,398 --> 00:35:19,127
Did you guys hear that?

525
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,265
Nobody move.

526
00:35:34,815 --> 00:35:36,680
Tell me that's not what I think it is.

527
00:35:40,287 --> 00:35:41,345
Muscovite.

528
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:42,746
Muscovite.

529
00:35:42,923 --> 00:35:44,857
What's muscovite?

530
00:35:47,361 --> 00:35:50,922
- Muscovite is a thin type of rock formation.
- How thin?

531
00:35:51,098 --> 00:35:54,795
Well, so thin that the slightest change
in weight and pressure...

532
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:57,631
...can cause it to shatter.

533
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,063
And we're standing on a lot of it.

534
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:02,733
Just stop. Stop.

535
00:36:06,614 --> 00:36:07,638
Okay, they're stopped.

536
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,775
I need you to walk back
exactly the way we came from.

537
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:13,146
Very, very calmly, okay?

538
00:36:14,488 --> 00:36:15,648
Tread lightly.

539
00:36:15,823 --> 00:36:17,814
Heel, toe. Doing good.

540
00:36:17,992 --> 00:36:20,358
Doing great. Very slowly.

541
00:36:20,527 --> 00:36:22,586
Good. Come on.

542
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:29,563
That's it.

543
00:36:31,005 --> 00:36:32,131
That's great.

544
00:36:32,306 --> 00:36:33,603
- Really careful.
- Keep going.

545
00:36:35,476 --> 00:36:37,103
No!

546
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,687
It's actually thicker than I thought.

547
00:37:07,508 --> 00:37:10,102
We're still falling!

548
00:37:22,723 --> 00:37:24,190
Trevor, what's at the bottom?

549
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:26,189
Well, if what Verne wrote was right...

550
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,056
...these tunnels could go for hundreds,
thousands of miles.

551
00:37:29,229 --> 00:37:30,526
Verne was not right.

552
00:37:30,698 --> 00:37:32,529
Trevor, finish. What's at the bottom?

553
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,725
Most likely theory is that it just ends.

554
00:37:34,902 --> 00:37:38,235
Ends? Got any other theories?

555
00:37:38,405 --> 00:37:41,397
Well, the walls of this tunnel
could have gently eroded...

556
00:37:41,575 --> 00:37:43,543
...by water which still runs through it...

557
00:37:43,711 --> 00:37:46,805
...providing a gradual break to our fall.

558
00:37:46,981 --> 00:37:49,882
- Kind of like a water slide.
- Water slide.

559
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,449
Okay, that's a theory.

560
00:37:51,618 --> 00:37:55,748
But wouldn't the water have formed
stalagmites pointing straight up at us?

561
00:37:55,923 --> 00:37:58,221
- We'll be skewered.
- That is also possible.

562
00:38:14,641 --> 00:38:16,108
Is that water?

563
00:38:16,276 --> 00:38:17,675
Yes. Water.

564
00:38:17,845 --> 00:38:19,540
Water slide, water slide.

565
00:38:19,713 --> 00:38:22,011
Here it comes. Hang on.

566
00:39:00,888 --> 00:39:02,947
Sean! Sean!

567
00:39:03,457 --> 00:39:05,891
Sean, Sean, you all right?

568
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,857
We didn't get skewered.

569
00:39:08,028 --> 00:39:09,962
Make for the rocks.

570
00:39:18,705 --> 00:39:20,605
Where's Hannah?

571
00:39:20,774 --> 00:39:23,834
Hannah! Hannah!

572
00:39:38,425 --> 00:39:40,017
My backpack was too heavy.

573
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,175
Thank you.

574
00:40:01,748 --> 00:40:03,613
So where does that put us now?

575
00:40:06,854 --> 00:40:08,845
Back to one.

576
00:40:12,426 --> 00:40:14,394
Guys, where are we?

577
00:40:14,561 --> 00:40:15,789
Are those stars?

578
00:40:23,103 --> 00:40:24,798
No.

579
00:40:24,972 --> 00:40:27,702
That's just the ceiling of the cave.

580
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:31,402
Is it just me, or is the cave ceiling...

581
00:40:32,379 --> 00:40:33,971
...moving?

582
00:40:35,983 --> 00:40:37,644
Yeah.

583
00:40:38,118 --> 00:40:40,313
It does look like it...

584
00:40:40,487 --> 00:40:41,920
...doesn't it?

585
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,543
They're birds.

586
00:41:08,615 --> 00:41:10,344
Electric birds?

587
00:41:10,517 --> 00:41:13,077
They look like <i>Cyanis rosopteryx.</i>

588
00:41:13,253 --> 00:41:17,553
Only they're bioluminescent,
like fireflies or glowworms.

589
00:41:17,724 --> 00:41:18,748
It's incredible.

590
00:41:30,304 --> 00:41:31,931
Cool.

591
00:41:32,105 --> 00:41:34,369
Glow... birds.

592
00:41:44,685 --> 00:41:46,118
Have you seen
these creatures before?

593
00:41:46,286 --> 00:41:48,379
Yeah, in the museum,
but they were fossilized.

594
00:41:48,555 --> 00:41:51,786
These things have been extinct
for over 150 million years.

595
00:42:04,404 --> 00:42:06,634
Where are they going?
- Hey, a tunnel.

596
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,337
Guys, come on.

597
00:42:11,311 --> 00:42:13,176
Sean, wait. Wait for me.

598
00:42:40,574 --> 00:42:45,102
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the center of the Earth.

599
00:42:49,616 --> 00:42:50,640
Max was right.

600
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,253
He was right.

601
00:42:54,788 --> 00:42:58,383
Max was right!

602
00:43:01,028 --> 00:43:02,359
Your dad was right.

603
00:43:02,863 --> 00:43:03,887
He was right.

604
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,731
Hannah, your dad was right too.

605
00:43:07,968 --> 00:43:09,196
They both believed...

606
00:43:09,369 --> 00:43:12,827
...in something
that everyone told them was impossible.

607
00:43:13,006 --> 00:43:14,997
He was right.

608
00:43:17,311 --> 00:43:20,474
- What's that light up there?
- I can't tell.

609
00:43:20,647 --> 00:43:26,552
It must be some sort
of luminescent gas combination.

610
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,849
I don't know.

611
00:43:29,022 --> 00:43:31,820
It's like a terrarium.

612
00:43:31,992 --> 00:43:35,223
A terrarium thousands of miles
beneath the crust of the Earth.

613
00:43:37,931 --> 00:43:42,493
A world within the world.

614
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:59,417
"The waterfalls, which for a long time,
could be heard flowing from afar...

615
00:43:59,586 --> 00:44:03,283
...now cascaded along
the towering canyon walls...

616
00:44:03,457 --> 00:44:05,891
...streaming along the rock
with no end."

617
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,691
I mean,
it's the same thing Liedenbrock wrote.

618
00:44:08,862 --> 00:44:12,889
Are we saying that Liedenbrock
the character was real?

619
00:44:13,066 --> 00:44:14,226
That he existed?

620
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:17,928
Someone came down here.
Someone saw all this.

621
00:44:18,105 --> 00:44:20,972
Someone got out
and someone told Verne.

622
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:22,904
Somebody got out?

623
00:44:23,076 --> 00:44:25,135
That's the best thing I've heard all day.

624
00:44:25,312 --> 00:44:27,405
Doesn't this
just completely blow your mind?

625
00:44:50,971 --> 00:44:53,064
My mind is blown, yes.

626
00:45:02,082 --> 00:45:05,142
Enormous fossilized mushrooms.

627
00:45:05,318 --> 00:45:08,082
Sort of like humongous fungus.

628
00:45:11,258 --> 00:45:13,818
- Everything in the book is real?
- Probably.

629
00:45:13,994 --> 00:45:16,929
- And the really dangerous parts?
- I was thinking about that too.

630
00:45:17,097 --> 00:45:18,394
Right.

631
00:45:20,033 --> 00:45:21,057
Trevor, come quick.

632
00:45:21,234 --> 00:45:22,531
- Sean?
- Sean?

633
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,994
- I'm going in.
- Yeah, wait up.

634
00:45:49,796 --> 00:45:51,525
Hey, slow down.

635
00:45:52,265 --> 00:45:53,357
I'll be right there.

636
00:46:19,392 --> 00:46:21,622
Someone actually lived here?

637
00:46:21,795 --> 00:46:23,729
That somebody...

638
00:46:25,298 --> 00:46:27,289
...was Liedenbrock.

639
00:46:29,436 --> 00:46:31,301
Look at all his gear.

640
00:46:31,938 --> 00:46:34,202
All this, state of the art...

641
00:46:34,841 --> 00:46:36,832
...a century ago.

642
00:47:35,535 --> 00:47:37,196
Hey, Trevor.

643
00:47:37,737 --> 00:47:39,568
I think I found Liedenbrock's notebook.

644
00:47:42,475 --> 00:47:44,033
Look.

645
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:48,169
Looks like on the other side of those trees
there's some sort of underground ocean.

646
00:47:48,348 --> 00:47:49,906
Yeah.

647
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,283
I don't think
that's Liedenbrock's handwriting.

648
00:47:59,659 --> 00:48:01,593
It's my dad's.

649
00:48:03,196 --> 00:48:04,788
Trevor?

650
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,699
Trevor?

651
00:48:11,605 --> 00:48:13,505
Can I talk to you for a minute?

652
00:48:13,673 --> 00:48:14,697
Out here.

653
00:48:14,874 --> 00:48:17,274
Can you wait here for a minute?

654
00:48:33,026 --> 00:48:35,927
Hey, I think I found Max.

655
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:17,602
I never really got a chance to know him.

656
00:49:20,106 --> 00:49:23,598
I mean, I wish I did.

657
00:49:23,977 --> 00:49:27,879
He wrote something
and I want you to hear it.

658
00:49:30,617 --> 00:49:34,815
"August 14, 1997.

659
00:49:35,655 --> 00:49:37,714
Today was Sean's third birthday.

660
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,693
Six weeks ago, I promised myself
I would be home in time...

661
00:49:43,863 --> 00:49:45,797
...to give him his first baseball glove.

662
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,827
Now I'm worried...

663
00:49:51,604 --> 00:49:53,936
...that I'll never get the chance.

664
00:49:58,178 --> 00:50:04,310
I set out to make an incredible discovery
to share with Trevor and the world.

665
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:08,452
But now, I would trade it all...

666
00:50:09,556 --> 00:50:12,184
...just to be able to watch you grow up...

667
00:50:12,358 --> 00:50:16,317
...to be the brave and caring man...

668
00:50:16,496 --> 00:50:19,556
...I am certain you will become.

669
00:50:23,803 --> 00:50:25,168
Happy birthday, Sean.

670
00:50:27,273 --> 00:50:28,934
I love you.

671
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,974
Daddy."

672
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:48,127
Goodbye, Max.

673
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,636
Come on.

674
00:51:20,393 --> 00:51:22,122
According to Max's journal...

675
00:51:22,295 --> 00:51:27,756
...we're here in this giant air pocket
that's surrounded by lava.

676
00:51:27,934 --> 00:51:31,563
And during periods
of intense seismic activity...

677
00:51:34,274 --> 00:51:37,437
- Like the one we're in now.
- That's right.

678
00:51:37,977 --> 00:51:40,036
- the magma that surrounds us...

679
00:51:40,213 --> 00:51:43,376
...turns this place
into pretty much just a big oven.

680
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:45,780
Was that what happened to my dad?

681
00:51:52,659 --> 00:51:55,355
Look, I know I'm just a kid,
but I can handle this, really.

682
00:51:55,528 --> 00:51:57,359
Sit down.

683
00:51:59,299 --> 00:52:00,994
Max was planning an escape.

684
00:52:01,167 --> 00:52:05,831
His notes say that temperatures down here
can easily hit 200 degrees.

685
00:52:06,005 --> 00:52:08,405
A human being can't survive
beyond 135.

686
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,066
- It's already 95 degrees.
- It was 82 when we got here.

687
00:52:11,244 --> 00:52:13,576
- Temperature's rising quickly.
- So, what do we do?

688
00:52:13,746 --> 00:52:15,680
I say that we follow Max's plan.

689
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:19,541
"My analysis of the original Verne text...

690
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:24,179
...leads me to believe that across the ocean
due north of my current position...

691
00:52:24,357 --> 00:52:27,884
...is a geyser-like river which could be used
to return to the surface."

692
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,461
So, what we have to do
is get across this ocean...

693
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:34,691
...and find the geyser
and just hitch a ride topside.

694
00:52:34,868 --> 00:52:36,062
Topside sounds good.

695
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,760
It's a little trickier than that.

696
00:52:37,937 --> 00:52:40,132
It could get so hot
that the water'll evaporate.

697
00:52:40,306 --> 00:52:42,001
How much time do we have?

698
00:52:42,175 --> 00:52:44,268
Forty-eight hours. Seventy-two, tops.

699
00:52:45,712 --> 00:52:47,043
Probably less.

700
00:52:47,213 --> 00:52:49,306
Okay, so the question is:

701
00:52:49,482 --> 00:52:51,848
What is the fastest way
to get across the ocean?

702
00:52:52,018 --> 00:52:54,646
There's no way we can get around it,
because if we hike...

703
00:52:54,821 --> 00:52:56,083
Oh, we don't have time.

704
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,315
There's no time to do that.

705
00:53:01,027 --> 00:53:03,120
It's all in the book.

706
00:53:08,968 --> 00:53:10,902
Hey, you all right?

707
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:12,731
What's the temperature doing?

708
00:53:12,906 --> 00:53:14,567
It is a hundred degrees.

709
00:53:22,415 --> 00:53:25,976
Eat your trilobite, Sean.
We gotta keep our strength up.

710
00:53:26,886 --> 00:53:28,114
Attaboy.

711
00:53:32,992 --> 00:53:34,357
Hey.

712
00:53:34,527 --> 00:53:36,995
Don't we need a center mast?

713
00:53:37,163 --> 00:53:39,028
No. We don't need it.

714
00:53:39,198 --> 00:53:41,359
The wind that we want is way up there.

715
00:53:41,534 --> 00:53:44,935
Thermal. It's a lot faster
than what we got down here.

716
00:53:49,108 --> 00:53:50,973
Good job. That should just about do it.

717
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:53,305
Hey, I got something for you.

718
00:53:58,418 --> 00:54:00,852
What is this?
- It's a compass.

719
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,146
It was your dad's.

720
00:54:03,122 --> 00:54:05,750
I remember the Christmas
that your mom gave it to him.

721
00:54:05,925 --> 00:54:11,329
She wanted to make sure
that he could always find a way back home.

722
00:54:12,565 --> 00:54:16,661
And maybe it will help you
find a way back to her.

723
00:54:22,308 --> 00:54:24,071
- Thanks, Trevor.
- You got it.

724
00:54:24,243 --> 00:54:26,074
- It means a lot to me.
- Me too.

725
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:32,451
Oh, there's one thing you should know.
Down here, the polarity is reversed.

726
00:54:32,618 --> 00:54:34,586
I mean, north is south, south is north...

727
00:54:34,754 --> 00:54:37,985
...and we need to bear due north
across the sea.

728
00:54:38,424 --> 00:54:39,857
You mean, south.

729
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,988
Exactly.

730
00:55:04,617 --> 00:55:06,585
All right, it's starting to pick up now.

731
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,855
Okay, hold it. Hold it really steady.

732
00:55:10,023 --> 00:55:12,253
Good, good, good.

733
00:55:12,658 --> 00:55:14,717
- Good. Ready?
- Yeah.

734
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,725
Three, two, one, go!

735
00:55:19,298 --> 00:55:20,424
- Yeah.
- All right.

736
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,626
Yeah. All right.

737
00:55:27,473 --> 00:55:29,168
Yeah.

738
00:55:30,443 --> 00:55:31,808
Go, go, go.

739
00:55:33,379 --> 00:55:35,142
Yeah. Keep going.

740
00:55:42,722 --> 00:55:44,747
Whoa, we're going, we're going.

741
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,391
Hey, well, can you wait for me?

742
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:49,494
Well, get on.
- Come on, come on, let's go.

743
00:56:05,678 --> 00:56:07,236
He's back.

744
00:56:07,413 --> 00:56:09,313
Hey, little guy.

745
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:16,547
Seen those clouds?

746
00:56:16,722 --> 00:56:18,087
Yeah.

747
00:56:18,257 --> 00:56:22,523
The current's pulling us in the direction
we wanna go. We should lower the kite.

748
00:56:24,664 --> 00:56:27,098
Can't do that.
It's a hundred and nine degrees.

749
00:56:27,266 --> 00:56:28,290
It's getting hotter.

750
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,629
We need all the speed we can get.
Leave it up.

751
00:56:37,376 --> 00:56:38,866
It's just a little storm.

752
00:56:39,045 --> 00:56:41,513
Ain't no big deal.

753
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:49,544
Something moving down there.

754
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:52,421
Phosphorous and plankton.

755
00:56:52,592 --> 00:56:54,651
It's the same thing we saw
back at the beach.

756
00:56:54,827 --> 00:56:57,022
I don't know.
It looks kind of big for plankton.

757
00:56:57,196 --> 00:57:00,131
Sean, we're not at SeaWorld,
so back off a little bit.

758
00:57:00,299 --> 00:57:02,563
- All right?
- I think it's some sort of fish.

759
00:57:13,713 --> 00:57:15,010
No.

760
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:22,279
They're everywhere.

761
00:57:22,455 --> 00:57:24,548
Sean, I told you
we'd get to the batting cage.

762
00:57:24,724 --> 00:57:26,055
Batter up.

763
00:57:26,826 --> 00:57:29,090
Okay. Let's see what you've got.

764
00:57:30,763 --> 00:57:33,163
Yeah. Line drive.

765
00:57:38,671 --> 00:57:39,763
- Sean!
- Do you hear something?

766
00:57:43,109 --> 00:57:44,235
- Hello?
- <i>Sean.</i>

767
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:46,241
- Mom?
- <i>I think we have a bad connection.</i>

768
00:57:46,412 --> 00:57:48,073
Mom, I can't hear you.

769
00:57:48,247 --> 00:57:49,714
<i>Where are you?</i>

770
00:57:49,882 --> 00:57:53,215
Uncle Trevor and I, uh...

771
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:55,911
...we're sort of on a fishing trip and...

772
00:57:57,123 --> 00:57:58,454
<i>Are you having fun?</i>

773
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:02,592
Whoa, no, you don't.

774
00:58:02,762 --> 00:58:06,129
- Uncle Trevor just caught a really big one.
- <i>Sean?</i>

775
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:09,295
- My phone.
- Sean, do you know how to switch hit?

776
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:12,900
- Ready?
- Yeah.

777
00:58:13,973 --> 00:58:15,133
Out of the ball park.

778
00:58:15,308 --> 00:58:16,400
- Sean.
- Look out.

779
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:17,634
I got it, I got it.

780
00:58:24,984 --> 00:58:26,212
Sean.
- No, no, don't.

781
00:58:26,385 --> 00:58:28,319
Get away from the sides.

782
00:58:33,326 --> 00:58:34,452
Look what they're doing.

783
00:58:34,994 --> 00:58:36,825
They don't want us. They want the fish.

784
00:58:36,996 --> 00:58:40,295
Listen up.
Sean, you take the tiller, we'll get the line.

785
00:58:40,466 --> 00:58:41,865
Hannah, hold the slack.

786
00:58:42,034 --> 00:58:43,899
Sean, you wanna take us hard starboard?

787
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:45,537
What?

788
00:58:45,705 --> 00:58:46,797
That way.

789
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:52,277
Come on.

790
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:56,142
- Okay.
- Doing good.

791
00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:00,050
Now just let it out gently.
Let it out gently.

792
00:59:00,219 --> 00:59:01,379
Let it out slowly.

793
00:59:01,554 --> 00:59:02,919
It's working.

794
00:59:03,089 --> 00:59:05,614
We're pulling clear of them.

795
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,760
You're the man, Uncle Trev.

796
00:59:11,931 --> 00:59:15,799
That's what I've been telling
the scientific community for years.

797
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:21,603
Hannah.

798
00:59:21,774 --> 00:59:23,332
Let me see.

799
00:59:28,381 --> 00:59:29,678
The lines.

800
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:48,289
Got it.
- Sean.

801
00:59:48,467 --> 00:59:50,492
Sean, don't do that. No, Sean.

802
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:51,796
Sean!

803
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:55,473
- No, Sean!
- Trevor!

804
00:59:55,641 --> 00:59:57,973
- Sean!
- Hang on!

805
00:59:58,144 --> 01:00:01,602
Don't let go!

806
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:09,949
No.

807
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,480
Trevor?

808
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,180
Trevor?

809
01:01:19,225 --> 01:01:20,988
Hello?

810
01:01:23,729 --> 01:01:25,390
Hello?

811
01:01:27,066 --> 01:01:28,761
Hey, little guy. Where are we?

812
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,136
Hey, do you know
where I can get some water?

813
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:39,271
I'm talking to a bird.

814
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:41,572
I must be losing it.

815
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:55,650
Sean!

816
01:01:58,998 --> 01:02:01,558
Sean!

817
01:02:05,271 --> 01:02:07,034
Wait.

818
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:13,176
The wind blew him this way.

819
01:02:14,346 --> 01:02:16,576
We still heading north?

820
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:19,608
Yeah, still north.

821
01:02:19,785 --> 01:02:21,753
He's a smart kid. He knows the plan.

822
01:02:21,921 --> 01:02:24,481
I'm sure he'll be waiting by the river.

823
01:02:25,524 --> 01:02:27,321
Let's find that river.

824
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:35,664
Hey, come on, wait up.

825
01:02:42,074 --> 01:02:44,008
Where'd you go?

826
01:02:50,716 --> 01:02:52,775
Good job.

827
01:02:58,224 --> 01:02:59,987
Okay.

828
01:03:01,193 --> 01:03:03,218
Now which way?

829
01:03:09,068 --> 01:03:10,330
South.

830
01:03:10,503 --> 01:03:11,697
That's good.

831
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,771
The river's north.

832
01:03:14,673 --> 01:03:16,038
Okay.

833
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:20,778
Here, let me take that.

834
01:03:20,946 --> 01:03:22,937
- No, no, I'm fine.
- Come on, let me take it.

835
01:03:23,115 --> 01:03:25,174
- Trevor, I'm fine.
- Hannah, Hannah, I got it.

836
01:03:26,051 --> 01:03:28,246
Let's just stop for a second.

837
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:37,890
Hey, we're gonna find him.

838
01:03:43,102 --> 01:03:44,296
Drink that.

839
01:03:45,437 --> 01:03:47,701
- Is that the last of the water?
- Yeah.

840
01:03:47,873 --> 01:03:49,340
We're gonna need that. Keep it.

841
01:03:49,508 --> 01:03:51,567
Hannah, drink it.

842
01:03:53,712 --> 01:03:55,339
Come on.

843
01:04:06,325 --> 01:04:07,758
Duck!

844
01:04:10,095 --> 01:04:12,086
- What the...?
- What was that?

845
01:04:14,667 --> 01:04:17,101
Large carnivorous plant?

846
01:04:17,269 --> 01:04:18,930
Hannah.

847
01:04:19,705 --> 01:04:21,297
Hannah?

848
01:04:21,707 --> 01:04:23,334
Hannah.

849
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:24,800
Hannah.

850
01:04:29,415 --> 01:04:31,042
Hannah.

851
01:04:38,924 --> 01:04:39,913
Ugh.

852
01:04:52,671 --> 01:04:54,434
Hang in there.

853
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:03,104
That's one point for me, right?

854
01:05:03,282 --> 01:05:04,510
Right.

855
01:05:04,683 --> 01:05:07,948
Who's keeping track, right?

856
01:05:51,363 --> 01:05:53,160
I get it.

857
01:05:53,332 --> 01:05:55,459
It's a magnetic field.

858
01:06:20,759 --> 01:06:22,192
No way.

859
01:06:22,361 --> 01:06:24,522
Magnetic rocks?

860
01:08:00,959 --> 01:08:04,156
No, no. No, no, no.

861
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:24,843
No. No.

862
01:08:51,109 --> 01:08:53,634
You try that without wings.

863
01:09:07,593 --> 01:09:08,958
That's the river.

864
01:09:09,127 --> 01:09:11,789
Geyser must be inside that cave.

865
01:09:13,465 --> 01:09:17,993
Sean!

866
01:09:27,613 --> 01:09:28,978
Where is he?

867
01:09:29,381 --> 01:09:31,645
Where is he?

868
01:09:48,634 --> 01:09:50,499
Trevor?

869
01:09:54,973 --> 01:09:55,997
Trevor?

870
01:10:19,598 --> 01:10:24,365
Man, I really wish I'd read that book.

871
01:10:57,102 --> 01:10:58,660
I don't see him anywhere.

872
01:11:08,113 --> 01:11:09,808
Trevor? Trevor.

873
01:11:09,982 --> 01:11:11,745
Hang on a minute. What are you doing?

874
01:11:12,084 --> 01:11:13,984
I'm going to get my nephew.

875
01:11:15,887 --> 01:11:17,411
Hannah.

876
01:11:17,923 --> 01:11:22,257
This is all my fault.

877
01:11:22,828 --> 01:11:24,489
Save yourself.

878
01:11:25,063 --> 01:11:26,860
Just go home.

879
01:11:27,632 --> 01:11:30,066
I'll wait for you at the river...

880
01:11:30,235 --> 01:11:32,726
...for as long as I can.

881
01:11:39,878 --> 01:11:41,243
What did you do that for?

882
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,510
Just in case.

883
01:12:56,354 --> 01:12:58,822
Sean!

884
01:12:58,990 --> 01:13:01,185
Sean!

885
01:13:19,878 --> 01:13:21,743
Sean!

886
01:13:23,281 --> 01:13:24,942
Sean?!

887
01:13:26,284 --> 01:13:27,842
Sean!

888
01:13:30,388 --> 01:13:31,719
Sean!

889
01:13:34,059 --> 01:13:35,686
Sean! Sean!

890
01:13:57,382 --> 01:13:58,815
Come on!

891
01:14:02,621 --> 01:14:03,952
Oh, God, I'm glad to see you.

892
01:14:04,122 --> 01:14:05,146
Yeah, you too.

893
01:14:05,323 --> 01:14:07,416
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

894
01:14:07,592 --> 01:14:08,786
We should go.

895
01:14:10,162 --> 01:14:11,493
Wait, wait, wait.

896
01:14:11,663 --> 01:14:14,632
- Is that the geyser?
- Yeah, that's where we're going.

897
01:14:16,501 --> 01:14:18,196
Come on.

898
01:14:19,437 --> 01:14:23,032
- Haven't you ever seen a dinosaur before?
- Not with skin on it.

899
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:31,948
He's too fast. We're not gonna make it.

900
01:14:36,922 --> 01:14:39,152
- Trevor, what are you doing?
- That's muscovite.

901
01:14:39,324 --> 01:14:41,417
Same thing that we fell through before.

902
01:14:41,593 --> 01:14:43,424
There's no way it's gonna hold you.

903
01:14:43,595 --> 01:14:45,893
It can't hold him either. Now you run.

904
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:48,032
Trevor, no.

905
01:14:50,735 --> 01:14:52,896
It's not breaking, Trevor.

906
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:55,062
Keep running!

907
01:14:58,610 --> 01:15:00,043
- He's gaining on you.
- I know.

908
01:15:00,212 --> 01:15:02,271
Keep going.

909
01:15:03,315 --> 01:15:05,215
Ah! Whoa.

910
01:15:06,751 --> 01:15:09,015
Trevor, it's working.

911
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,060
Look out!

912
01:15:27,372 --> 01:15:28,805
Trevor!

913
01:15:35,113 --> 01:15:37,946
I just remembered something.
I hate field work.

914
01:15:39,117 --> 01:15:40,277
Trevor, come on.

915
01:15:43,688 --> 01:15:45,588
That was like... And then you were like...

916
01:15:45,757 --> 01:15:47,987
Yeah, I know. I'm really lucky.

917
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:49,854
Okay, that way.

918
01:15:50,028 --> 01:15:53,486
That, no good. That, worse.

919
01:15:53,665 --> 01:15:55,292
Let's go.

920
01:16:02,774 --> 01:16:05,675
The river.
How are we gonna get to the geyser?

921
01:16:05,844 --> 01:16:08,108
- Water's boiling.
- We need something that floats.

922
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,872
Anything. I could use a log or...

923
01:16:10,048 --> 01:16:12,243
What we really need is a boat.

924
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:26,190
Who had dibs again?

925
01:16:29,367 --> 01:16:30,391
Come on, jump in.

926
01:16:30,568 --> 01:16:33,731
- The best mountain guide on the planet.
- Got that right.

927
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:39,333
You didn't really think
you were gonna scare me away, did you?

928
01:16:39,811 --> 01:16:42,143
You'll have to work harder than that.

929
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:54,881
I'm afraid I'll have to charge you extra
for this bit.

930
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:57,255
Can I open a tab? Whoa.

931
01:16:58,830 --> 01:17:00,388
What was that?

932
01:17:01,132 --> 01:17:03,896
It's not good. That's the river bed.

933
01:17:04,069 --> 01:17:05,866
We're running out of water.

934
01:17:07,439 --> 01:17:09,737
Well, guys,
you might wanna hang on to something.

935
01:17:09,908 --> 01:17:13,207
This ride is about to get a little bit...

936
01:17:21,486 --> 01:17:23,181
Bumpy.

937
01:17:26,624 --> 01:17:28,285
- Is everybody all right?
- Yeah.

938
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:30,360
Where are we?

939
01:17:32,163 --> 01:17:34,324
What's that light down there?

940
01:17:34,632 --> 01:17:36,099
That's lava.

941
01:17:36,401 --> 01:17:39,268
It's magma, and it's rising.

942
01:17:39,437 --> 01:17:42,668
There's supposed to be water in this tunnel.
Steam, water shooting up.

943
01:17:42,841 --> 01:17:45,139
We're too late for the geyser,
we missed it.

944
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:47,904
- What do we do?
- Do you have any suggestions, professor?

945
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:51,105
Without water, no steam.
Without steam, we're not going anywhere.

946
01:17:51,282 --> 01:17:54,877
This place looks like there hasn't been
water here in two, three hours now.

947
01:17:55,053 --> 01:17:58,113
- But the walls are still wet.
- That's impossible, it's 130 degrees.

948
01:17:58,289 --> 01:17:59,722
- Trevor. Behind you.
- What?

949
01:18:02,527 --> 01:18:04,119
It is wet.

950
01:18:04,596 --> 01:18:07,121
It's cold. There's water behind here.

951
01:18:07,298 --> 01:18:10,199
There's gotta be water behind some pocket
or underground river.

952
01:18:10,368 --> 01:18:11,665
Trevor, it's getting closer.

953
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:15,462
Hey, that's magnesium.

954
01:18:18,743 --> 01:18:20,904
- We're slipping.
- How many flares you got left?

955
01:18:26,117 --> 01:18:27,846
Three.
What do you wanna do with them?

956
01:18:28,019 --> 01:18:29,850
Gonna light the magnesium. On purpose.

957
01:18:31,823 --> 01:18:33,415
Hang on.

958
01:18:37,529 --> 01:18:39,793
Oh, come on. It's too wet.

959
01:18:44,335 --> 01:18:46,633
Got to get further down.
Give me another one.

960
01:18:48,606 --> 01:18:50,369
Hold my legs.

961
01:18:55,146 --> 01:18:56,704
Come on.

962
01:19:01,519 --> 01:19:04,386
You're gonna have to tie me off.
I gotta get down lower.

963
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:06,085
Trevor, it's getting closer.

964
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:09,354
That's good. All right, ready.

965
01:19:13,131 --> 01:19:14,826
It's the last one.

966
01:19:31,316 --> 01:19:32,749
Trevor, be careful.

967
01:19:36,321 --> 01:19:37,879
How's that?
- Little more.

968
01:19:38,056 --> 01:19:39,580
Hurry.

969
01:19:43,328 --> 01:19:45,523
Lower?
- Little more.

970
01:19:46,164 --> 01:19:47,324
Okay, hold off.

971
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,661
- Come on.
- Come on.

972
01:19:50,835 --> 01:19:52,826
Come on, light.
- Come on.

973
01:19:54,739 --> 01:19:55,763
Come on, Trevor.

974
01:19:55,940 --> 01:19:58,306
Still wet. Gonna have to
throw it to the other side.

975
01:20:17,562 --> 01:20:18,995
What?

976
01:20:19,464 --> 01:20:20,556
No.

977
01:20:20,732 --> 01:20:22,290
No!

978
01:20:27,805 --> 01:20:29,534
Trevor, come on.

979
01:20:30,008 --> 01:20:31,805
- Trevor, come on.
- It's lit, it's lit.

980
01:20:31,976 --> 01:20:33,204
Pull!

981
01:20:33,545 --> 01:20:34,773
- Pull me up.
- Hurry.

982
01:20:34,946 --> 01:20:36,106
Pull me up. Pull me up.

983
01:20:37,515 --> 01:20:39,244
Come on, pull it. Pull it.
- Pull.

984
01:20:39,417 --> 01:20:42,079
Watch the teeth. Watch the teeth.

985
01:20:42,253 --> 01:20:44,244
Sean! Come on!

986
01:20:44,422 --> 01:20:45,650
Get down, it's gonna blow.

987
01:20:58,236 --> 01:20:59,464
This thing's heating up.

988
01:20:59,637 --> 01:21:01,229
I know!

989
01:21:09,514 --> 01:21:12,483
- Hang on!
- Trust me, I'm hanging on!

990
01:21:14,686 --> 01:21:16,950
Is that sky?

991
01:21:30,501 --> 01:21:32,366
Hang on, everybody!

992
01:21:32,537 --> 01:21:34,937
- Stop saying that!
- It just keeps coming up!

993
01:22:25,523 --> 01:22:26,990
That's Mount Vesuvius.

994
01:22:27,458 --> 01:22:30,894
Hey, Sean, if your mom asks you
what you did this weekend...

995
01:22:31,062 --> 01:22:35,055
...you tell her Uncle Trevor took you to Italy.
- Italy?

996
01:22:53,117 --> 01:22:54,209
Sean?

997
01:22:54,385 --> 01:22:55,409
Sean?

998
01:22:57,655 --> 01:22:59,714
What? I just took
a few geological samples.

999
01:22:59,891 --> 01:23:01,449
A few geological samples?

1000
01:23:01,626 --> 01:23:05,084
A few pounds of samples, but what
do you expect? I'm a scientist's son.

1001
01:23:07,432 --> 01:23:09,559
Look. Look.

1002
01:23:09,734 --> 01:23:12,259
You take this.

1003
01:23:12,437 --> 01:23:15,600
You take. We are sorry.

1004
01:23:21,846 --> 01:23:24,713
You want slide again?

1005
01:23:25,650 --> 01:23:27,379
Slide is okay. It's fine.

1006
01:23:27,552 --> 01:23:29,816
Anything what you want.

1007
01:23:38,963 --> 01:23:40,590
What was that for?

1008
01:23:40,765 --> 01:23:42,790
Now we're even.

1009
01:23:56,314 --> 01:23:59,181
Leonard, I'm back.
Stop doing what you're doing.

1010
01:23:59,350 --> 01:24:01,284
What am I doing?

1011
01:24:01,452 --> 01:24:03,249
Oh, look, you're looking for work.

1012
01:24:03,421 --> 01:24:05,616
You don't need to,
because you have a job...

1013
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:09,419
...with the Ásgeirsson-Anderson Institute
for Tectonophysical Exploration.

1014
01:24:09,594 --> 01:24:11,926
The Ásgeirsson-Anderson... What?

1015
01:24:12,096 --> 01:24:13,586
Still working on the name.

1016
01:24:13,765 --> 01:24:16,199
But the point is, rising tide lifts all boats.

1017
01:24:16,367 --> 01:24:17,994
Man, that's awesome.

1018
01:24:18,169 --> 01:24:20,330
I think... Am I a boat?

1019
01:24:20,505 --> 01:24:23,406
- You're a boat. We're back in business.
- All right, dude.

1020
01:24:23,574 --> 01:24:26,099
Well, well, well.
What's all the excitement about?

1021
01:24:26,277 --> 01:24:27,938
- Oh, hey, Alan. How are you?
- Good.

1022
01:24:28,112 --> 01:24:29,704
- What you doing?
- Oh, me?

1023
01:24:29,881 --> 01:24:32,372
I'm moving into my new lab.

1024
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:34,513
More importantly, where have you been?

1025
01:24:34,685 --> 01:24:38,519
I heard you missed your Monday lecture
and both of your students complained.

1026
01:24:38,689 --> 01:24:39,678
Oh!

1027
01:24:41,025 --> 01:24:43,425
I took a quick vacation.
Best thing I could've done.

1028
01:24:43,594 --> 01:24:44,652
That is exciting.

1029
01:24:44,829 --> 01:24:47,093
You'll have to promise
to tell me about it, okay?

1030
01:24:47,265 --> 01:24:51,429
Not sure if I'll have time, but you can read
about it in <i>Scientific American.</i>

1031
01:24:53,971 --> 01:24:55,063
<i>Scientific American?</i>

1032
01:24:55,239 --> 01:24:57,764
Look, I just want to say,
no hard feelings, okay?

1033
01:24:57,942 --> 01:25:00,308
About the laboratory moving
and expansion thing.

1034
01:25:00,478 --> 01:25:02,969
So I'm actually looking
for my own building anyway.

1035
01:25:03,147 --> 01:25:05,980
How exactly
are you going to do that, Trevor?

1036
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:09,217
Well, let's just say
I fell into a small fortune.

1037
01:25:11,956 --> 01:25:13,981
So tomorrow
you're gonna be a Canadian.

1038
01:25:14,158 --> 01:25:16,456
Yep. Looks that way.

1039
01:25:21,532 --> 01:25:25,229
I'd say that was a lot of male bonding
packed into very little time.

1040
01:25:25,403 --> 01:25:28,770
What do you say
we take a couple weeks next time?

1041
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:30,407
A couple weeks?

1042
01:25:30,575 --> 01:25:33,043
- What are you doing over Christmas break?
- Nothing. I'm free.

01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:35,338
I just found this in your dad's stuff.

1044
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:37,374
Give it a read.

1045
01:25:37,548 --> 01:25:39,539
- <i>"Lost City of Atlantis."</i>
- Mm-hm.

1046
01:25:39,717 --> 01:25:41,275
We'll talk.

1047
01:25:44,355 --> 01:25:45,447
Sean, what is that?

1048
01:25:46,157 --> 01:25:48,250
- I'm just feeding my pet.
- What pet?

1049
01:25:48,426 --> 01:25:50,394
Sean.

1050
01:25:50,695 --> 01:25:53,186
- You think my mom will let me keep him?
- I don't know.

1051
01:25:53,364 --> 01:25:55,457
Might not even stay here.

1052
01:25:55,633 --> 01:25:57,430
- Look at it.
- Hey, come on.

1053
01:25:57,602 --> 01:25:59,797
- This is your problem.
- Where are you going?

1054
01:26:00,271 --> 01:26:03,007
I got some food for you. Come on.
Come back down here.

1055
01:26:03,274 --> 01:26:04,866
Come on.
