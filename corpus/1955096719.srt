1
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:28,461
Fuck this shit!

2
00:00:57,321 --> 00:00:58,724
Let's go home.

3
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:08,666
<i>Regret and remorse.</i>

4
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,271
<i>Amends and atonement,
that's life right?</i>

5
00:01:12,304 --> 00:01:14,106
<i>But this next one is for you.</i>

6
00:01:14,138 --> 00:01:18,977
<i>All you lost souls racing down
that long road to redemption,</i>

7
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,846
<i>and all you sinners running
from your past,</i>

8
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:25,917
<i>but heading straight into that
bitter darkness up ahead.</i>

9
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,720
<i>We're all on that same
endless highway.</i>

10
00:01:28,753 --> 00:01:31,456
<i>The one with no name
and no exits.</i>

11
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:35,161
<i>Looking for a way out of
tonight and into tomorrow.</i>

12
00:01:35,194 --> 00:01:37,559
<i>Well, they gonna
try to stop you,</i>

13
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,499
<i>but you got to say
"Fuck it" and keep moving.</i>

14
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:42,534
<i>Because this is your highway.</i>

15
00:01:42,568 --> 00:01:44,829
<i>And tonight might
just be the night</i>

16
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,206
you finally out run
those wicked demons,

17
00:01:47,238 --> 00:01:48,940
<i>once in for all.</i>

18
00:01:48,974 --> 00:01:53,179
<i>And I'll be right here with you
making sure you get where you're going.</i>

19
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,682
What's up?

20
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:32,585
Nothing.

21
00:02:56,475 --> 00:02:58,211
Don't worry, we're fine.

22
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:23,168
It's customer's only.

23
00:03:26,203 --> 00:03:27,172
Hey!

24
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:30,910
Read the sign.

25
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:37,884
Twenty on the truck.

26
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:46,558
Rough night?

27
00:03:50,761 --> 00:03:51,730
Yeah.

28
00:04:12,284 --> 00:04:13,786
Have a nice day.

29
00:05:15,747 --> 00:05:18,316
Mich, let's get
the fuck out of here.

30
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:20,987
Come on!

31
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,659
Come again soon.

32
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:35,701
Fuck!

33
00:05:55,052 --> 00:05:56,088
What the fuck?

34
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:05,097
What the fuck?

35
00:06:11,636 --> 00:06:13,105
Rough night?

36
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:33,858
What the fuck?

37
00:07:13,698 --> 00:07:15,367
There's gotta be a way out.

38
00:07:25,242 --> 00:07:26,411
What if there's not?

39
00:07:29,413 --> 00:07:30,415
Pullover.

40
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:32,618
-What?
-Pullover.

41
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,918
Are you crazy?

42
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:36,187
What you gonna do?

43
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:38,290
I'm not running.

44
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:40,259
Mich!

45
00:07:40,725 --> 00:07:41,927
Mich!

46
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:44,997
Hey!

47
00:07:45,362 --> 00:07:47,331
Hey!

48
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:49,234
I know we've had a
pretty fucked up day,

49
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:52,570
but if you can keep it together for
a little bit longer that'll be great.

50
00:07:52,603 --> 00:07:54,672
Why? What are
we running to?

51
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:56,008
What?

52
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,209
So we get out of here
and go home and then what?

53
00:07:58,242 --> 00:08:02,380
And then nothing we're home,
that's the point. Back to normal.

54
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:03,414
Exactly.

55
00:08:04,014 --> 00:08:05,516
Mich.

56
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,119
You wanted this.

57
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:10,922
We did this for you, we
did this for Catherine.

58
00:08:10,956 --> 00:08:13,792
So get in the fucking truck!

59
00:08:13,824 --> 00:08:15,795
I'm not asking
you to stay.

60
00:08:18,797 --> 00:08:20,099
You've lost it, man.

61
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:22,868
You want to stay
here and get killed?

62
00:08:23,634 --> 00:08:24,769
I'll see you around.

63
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:27,540
Jack, come on.

64
00:08:33,878 --> 00:08:36,214
What do you want?

65
00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:39,984
I think you've figured it out,
they've come to collect.

66
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,323
There's no way out,
we've fucked up!

67
00:08:45,522 --> 00:08:47,492
You know what, Mich, fuck you!

68
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:48,861
I'm going home.

69
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:58,370
Jack!

70
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,622
Dad.

71
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,662
Catherine?

72
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:59,418
Dad why
won't you help me?

73
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,155
Catherine!

74
00:12:11,896 --> 00:12:13,732
Dad help me!

75
00:12:15,032 --> 00:12:16,501
Catherine!

76
00:12:22,473 --> 00:12:24,742
Help!

77
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:27,445
Dad!

78
00:12:29,914 --> 00:12:31,716
Catherine!

79
00:12:31,748 --> 00:12:33,384
Catherine!

80
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:35,521
Catherine! Fuck!

81
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:36,848
It's piercing my brain.

82
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:39,684
My God, it's one o'clock.

83
00:13:39,717 --> 00:13:41,285
Guys we got to go.

84
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,789
Ava, get up.

85
00:13:45,622 --> 00:13:48,459
I've never been so
hungover in like...

86
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,434
You guys got everything?

87
00:14:04,442 --> 00:14:06,311
It's to early for this!

88
00:14:06,944 --> 00:14:09,046
Southbound baby.

89
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:12,116
<i>...goin' on down
that road and each</i>

90
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,920
<i>time hold on and
don't ever let go.</i>

91
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:32,203
Yeo!

92
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:33,704
Hannah.

93
00:15:06,203 --> 00:15:07,606
Whoa!

94
00:15:21,953 --> 00:15:23,855
Man, this thing is fucked.

95
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:27,258
Of course, the one day we can't
afford to stop, we get a flat.

96
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,761
It would be fine if your drum kit
didn't have to take up so much space.

97
00:15:29,794 --> 00:15:33,564
But it wasn't my idea to take
out the spare tire, Kimberly.

98
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:36,934
Whatever, I'll just call triple
A, can you hand me my bag?

99
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:38,569
Nope.

100
00:15:38,602 --> 00:15:39,938
Do you even know where we are?

101
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:46,377
GPS can't even find
us on my phone.

102
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,674
No we're not on a private road.

103
00:15:48,675 --> 00:15:51,049
We're in the middle of the
state highway right now.

104
00:15:51,082 --> 00:15:52,350
Why is it so hot?

105
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:53,450
<i>...we can't help you.</i>

106
00:15:53,483 --> 00:15:55,019
Well, yeah. Thanks for nothing.

107
00:15:57,655 --> 00:15:59,690
The closest place is
four hours from here.

108
00:16:00,857 --> 00:16:02,260
And it's closed.

109
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:04,562
-Why?
-It's so early.

110
00:16:04,594 --> 00:16:06,964
The chick on the phone sounded
like she was at a bar.

111
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,934
Which reminds me.

112
00:16:11,968 --> 00:16:13,804
Wait, you're not serious, Kim.

113
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:17,943
What? It's not like
we going anywhere.

114
00:16:25,349 --> 00:16:26,684
Warm beer.

115
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,872
Guys, car!

116
00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:52,767
Great! I was seriously thinking
who I'll have to eat first,

117
00:16:52,768 --> 00:16:54,379
see you by the way.

118
00:16:54,978 --> 00:16:56,047
Youngest.

119
00:17:01,218 --> 00:17:03,888
Can we offer
you a ride?

120
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:10,328
Is there a town close by? Triple
A says there's nothing for miles.

121
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,866
No we are pretty far out. Actually
closest town is quite a way south.

122
00:17:14,898 --> 00:17:17,068
You would wanna go
to Pete's auto body.

123
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,402
Okay.

124
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:19,670
Talk to Pete.

125
00:17:19,703 --> 00:17:21,638
He's not gonna be there
until tomorrow, though.

126
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:27,344
Why don't you come to our place?
Just until we can get hold of Pete.

127
00:17:27,377 --> 00:17:31,949
Thanks a lot really, but we're good.
We're used to sleeping in the van.

128
00:17:31,982 --> 00:17:33,617
You know, Betty,

129
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:38,056
I wonder if the camper at Kensington
has the same size tire as the van?

130
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:40,191
Sure they have a spare.

131
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:41,559
Bet the boys could
fix it right up.

132
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:44,561
Yeah! I guess
maybe we could.

133
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:49,000
No, we're good, thank
you, though. Really.

134
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:55,440
Well, suit yourselves.

135
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,475
Goodbye.

136
00:18:00,744 --> 00:18:01,445
Wait!

137
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:03,081
What? What are you doing?

138
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:06,351
We don't know where we are.
We haven't seen...

139
00:18:06,384 --> 00:18:09,087
This is not a good idea, to
go with those complete weirdos.

140
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,558
Look at us, look at them.
We're the weirdos.

141
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,395
I'd rather go with them than
with a bunch of rappie dudes.

142
00:18:31,107 --> 00:18:33,243
So are you girls
students?

143
00:18:33,277 --> 00:18:37,048
No, we're not,
we are in a band.

144
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,950
Fun, a rock and roll group.

145
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:43,721
-Yup.
-We play jazz.

146
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:44,822
Smooth jazz.

147
00:18:46,389 --> 00:18:48,826
I do love jazz.

148
00:18:52,663 --> 00:18:56,434
So, how long have you
guys lived out here?

149
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:59,103
I don't know,
since the war.

150
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,143
Is that a trap
or something?

151
00:19:05,175 --> 00:19:07,846
It probably was,
but broken now.

152
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:09,680
Phonies.

153
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:14,985
This is your fault, okay?

154
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:25,396
All right then.

155
00:19:25,428 --> 00:19:29,033
You don't have to worry about locking
it up, there's no one around for miles.

156
00:19:58,762 --> 00:19:59,964
Come on.

157
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:07,838
Here we are, the bathroom's
right there. Nap, shower,

158
00:20:07,871 --> 00:20:10,173
anything that you need to do.

159
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:13,710
The Kensington's are going to be
coming over for supper.

160
00:20:13,743 --> 00:20:16,915
It's just so wonderful
to have some company.

161
00:20:17,615 --> 00:20:19,751
I'm sorry about Alex.

162
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,585
What did you just say?

163
00:20:21,618 --> 00:20:24,355
It's so wonderful to have
some company.

164
00:20:24,387 --> 00:20:25,889
No, before that.

165
00:20:25,923 --> 00:20:29,294
-I will whip up some supper for us.
-Thank you.

166
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,365
What the fuck!

167
00:20:34,397 --> 00:20:39,169
They aren't old right? They act like
they're eighty and from the fifties.

168
00:20:39,203 --> 00:20:41,639
Bet they have the nastiest sex.

169
00:20:42,473 --> 00:20:43,808
Wait.

170
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,309
Did you guys hear that?

171
00:20:45,342 --> 00:20:46,777
What are you talking about?

172
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:49,813
Kim, this totally
looks like you.

173
00:20:49,847 --> 00:20:53,384
You like a hot milk maid.

174
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:56,119
They definitely have
the nastiest sex.

175
00:20:56,153 --> 00:20:59,991
My cousin is a Sunday school
teacher and she loves anal.

176
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:02,126
I really don't think
I'm hearing things.

177
00:21:02,158 --> 00:21:04,061
You're so gross.

178
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:05,329
You started it.

179
00:21:05,363 --> 00:21:07,231
This bed is like
a freaking cloud.

180
00:21:07,263 --> 00:21:09,466
I don't think it's a good idea
for us to take a nap here, Ava.

181
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,815
Hey, you totally had
sex with that old guy

182
00:21:11,816 --> 00:21:14,238
just because he had a
Tempur-Pedic mattress.

183
00:21:14,271 --> 00:21:15,874
Okay, he wasn't old.

184
00:21:16,272 --> 00:21:17,274
Old.

185
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:19,143
He was pretty old.

186
00:21:19,175 --> 00:21:20,877
He was 49, that's not old.

187
00:21:20,911 --> 00:21:23,214
-That's so old.
-That's old even for me.

188
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:29,654
Stop talking to me.

189
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:33,223
She's done it again.

190
00:21:33,257 --> 00:21:35,193
This is beautiful.

191
00:21:35,225 --> 00:21:36,727
Just beautiful.

192
00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:41,165
How lucky we are that you have access
to these old family recipe's, Betty.

193
00:21:45,403 --> 00:21:48,073
So, you guys have a tire?

194
00:21:51,107 --> 00:21:54,111
For the van! Yes, sure, the boys will
fix that up for you. Wont you, boys?

195
00:21:58,915 --> 00:22:01,019
Sorry, are these your son's?

196
00:22:01,618 --> 00:22:03,120
You look so young.

197
00:22:04,155 --> 00:22:06,824
You just made Betty's
year with that one.

198
00:22:06,857 --> 00:22:09,226
Actually we adopted the boys,

199
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,196
it's a long sad story.

200
00:22:14,632 --> 00:22:15,800
Let's give thanks.

201
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:20,905
Divine one,

202
00:22:21,871 --> 00:22:25,509
we offer our gratitude
for this beast.

203
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:27,411
For this blood.

204
00:22:27,444 --> 00:22:29,280
For these vessels of a new.

205
00:22:29,312 --> 00:22:30,714
We bow to you,

206
00:22:30,748 --> 00:22:32,817
for you all knowing.

207
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:34,886
We offer ourselves to you.

208
00:22:34,918 --> 00:22:37,155
For you are the master.

209
00:22:39,155 --> 00:22:40,325
Amen.

210
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:46,230
Um, what exactly
is in this dish?

211
00:22:46,262 --> 00:22:48,965
It's a Sunday roast.

212
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:53,238
I probably should have mentioned
before that I don't eat meat.

213
00:22:55,271 --> 00:22:57,508
I see.

214
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:03,748
You know there are some who just
don't have the luxury to not eat meat.

215
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,916
Only the strong survive,
right, boys?

216
00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:11,322
So you guys Russian
or something?

217
00:23:11,355 --> 00:23:14,893
Russian? That is a good one.

218
00:23:15,326 --> 00:23:16,761
No.

219
00:23:16,793 --> 00:23:20,263
Raymond and Betty their
just very traditional.

220
00:23:20,297 --> 00:23:22,500
Set in their ways, as are we.

221
00:23:22,532 --> 00:23:25,770
But it is no matter,
everything is fine,

222
00:23:25,802 --> 00:23:27,838
you don't have to
eat the meat.

223
00:23:27,871 --> 00:23:29,940
It's actually really good.

224
00:23:31,341 --> 00:23:32,910
It is.

225
00:23:33,644 --> 00:23:35,179
I thought there was four of you.

226
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:37,915
Enough.

227
00:24:16,753 --> 00:24:19,122
This place feels like
a bad acid trip.

228
00:24:19,155 --> 00:24:20,925
Those twins.

229
00:24:20,957 --> 00:24:23,293
What the fuck was that
prayer all about?

230
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,797
Why do you have be so negative?

231
00:24:27,397 --> 00:24:28,433
Seriously?

232
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:30,001
Yeah!

233
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,835
So we got a flat.

234
00:24:31,868 --> 00:24:32,970
What the fuck!

235
00:24:33,002 --> 00:24:34,237
We're here.

236
00:24:34,271 --> 00:24:38,442
With a roof over our head,
we got free dinner.

237
00:24:38,474 --> 00:24:40,811
What's the big deal?

238
00:24:40,845 --> 00:24:43,014
Why can't you just make
the best of things.

239
00:24:44,581 --> 00:24:47,351
I don't know, cause we have
a show to play tomorrow.

240
00:24:48,751 --> 00:24:51,388
And we're stuck
in some house,

241
00:24:51,422 --> 00:24:55,092
in the middle of nowhere, on some
road that doesn't seem to exist.

242
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:58,174
Sorry if I'm being a bummer
by pointing this out,

243
00:24:58,175 --> 00:25:00,064
but this isn't exactly normal.

244
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,505
Nothing's ever your fault.

245
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:10,809
-What?
-Nothing.

246
00:25:11,575 --> 00:25:12,977
Just...

247
00:25:13,978 --> 00:25:16,181
miss Alex that's all.

248
00:25:18,915 --> 00:25:21,219
If she were here everything
would've been different.

249
00:25:22,418 --> 00:25:24,821
Yeah, so do I, obviously.

250
00:25:24,855 --> 00:25:26,558
Then why did you
let her leave?

251
00:25:27,357 --> 00:25:28,893
What did you say?

252
00:25:31,494 --> 00:25:33,197
You let her leave that night.

253
00:25:34,932 --> 00:25:37,001
You wanted to fuck some...

254
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:39,337
nobody asshole in some...

255
00:25:39,369 --> 00:25:40,604
shit hole club.

256
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:43,441
I hope it was good.

257
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:47,945
I hope it was really good.

258
00:25:51,749 --> 00:25:53,851
Why are you doing
this right now?

259
00:25:53,884 --> 00:25:56,921
You know that I loved
her more than anything.

260
00:25:56,953 --> 00:25:58,990
It's not funny, Kim.

261
00:25:59,022 --> 00:26:01,892
You should see your
face right now.

262
00:26:01,925 --> 00:26:04,395
What the fuck, man,
that's so messed up.

263
00:26:04,427 --> 00:26:08,031
I didn't make her leave that
night, it's not my responsibility...

264
00:26:08,065 --> 00:26:10,167
My God! My God!

265
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,270
Okay, I'm gonna get you towel.

266
00:26:16,807 --> 00:26:18,443
Jesus!

267
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,311
Hey! They're really sick.

268
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:23,180
Ava and Kim can't stop
throwing up

269
00:26:23,213 --> 00:26:25,449
this black stuff all over the
place. We have to do something.

270
00:26:25,482 --> 00:26:27,484
Dear.

271
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:29,420
It's probably the meat.

272
00:26:29,453 --> 00:26:30,922
Newcomers.

273
00:26:30,954 --> 00:26:34,024
Well, the first time
is the worst time.

274
00:26:34,058 --> 00:26:35,992
What is in that meat?
What is going on?

275
00:26:36,026 --> 00:26:37,428
I got just the thing.

276
00:26:37,461 --> 00:26:40,365
They'll be fine as soon as
they get some medicine.

277
00:26:40,763 --> 00:26:42,633
Nice play.

278
00:26:54,712 --> 00:26:56,180
Thank you so much.

279
00:26:56,879 --> 00:26:58,815
This medicine is wonderful.

280
00:26:58,848 --> 00:27:00,652
Of course, darling.

281
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:03,854
See? All better now.

282
00:27:03,886 --> 00:27:06,924
Are you sure you don't want to change
into something more comfortable?

283
00:27:06,956 --> 00:27:09,126
Yeah, I'm sure, thank you.

284
00:27:09,158 --> 00:27:11,061
Shouldn't we be calling
a doctor, though?

285
00:27:11,095 --> 00:27:14,999
Don't you worry, Dale
knows what he's doing.

286
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:17,635
Old family recipe.

287
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:19,035
Yeah, from
the old world?

288
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:21,673
Yes, young lady,
from the old world.

289
00:27:23,307 --> 00:27:27,345
But I swear if I could
market this I'd be rich.

290
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:32,383
Sleep tight.

291
00:27:39,522 --> 00:27:42,993
-Guys we have got to go.
-You need to calm down.

292
00:27:43,761 --> 00:27:45,328
Let's just get some sleep.

293
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:49,800
Some peace, while the boys
can come fix our van.

294
00:27:49,832 --> 00:27:53,003
What? No. We go take their
tire and we get on the road.

295
00:27:53,037 --> 00:27:54,739
I will pay for a hotel.

296
00:27:54,771 --> 00:27:57,107
I'm not going anywhere.

297
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,309
How do we even get
to the van tonight?

298
00:28:00,476 --> 00:28:02,445
I'm going to bed.

299
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:05,149
I'm so, so sleepy.

300
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:10,154
How are you guys acting like
nothing is wrong right now?

301
00:28:10,186 --> 00:28:12,290
I wish Alex was here.

302
00:28:13,723 --> 00:28:16,194
I know. Me too.

303
00:28:16,926 --> 00:28:18,361
But she's dead.

304
00:28:18,395 --> 00:28:21,331
I wish Sadie was a
better friend to Alex.

305
00:29:51,922 --> 00:29:55,093
I have more faith
in you than that.

306
00:29:57,994 --> 00:30:01,598
Why did you leave me here?

307
00:30:07,637 --> 00:30:08,638
My God.

308
00:30:20,216 --> 00:30:22,285
Let us rejoice.

309
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:24,155
Let us rejoice.

310
00:30:24,187 --> 00:30:26,890
Hear now his creed.

311
00:30:26,924 --> 00:30:31,095
Contentment thou shall find,
through suffering.

312
00:30:31,127 --> 00:30:33,963
And through long years in it.

313
00:30:33,996 --> 00:30:38,299
For the damned
do not grow old.

314
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:39,637
Their minds
are nourished.

315
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:43,206
Are living in the dark
waters of the Gods.

316
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,642
Know us now.

317
00:30:44,675 --> 00:30:47,611
Thou has begun my transition.

318
00:30:48,878 --> 00:30:51,748
Thou has begun my transition.

319
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,287
Thou has begun my transition.

320
00:30:57,221 --> 00:31:00,191
Thou has begun my transition.

321
00:31:01,023 --> 00:31:03,927
Thou has begun my transition.

322
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:10,267
Damned do not grow old.

323
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,435
Thou has begun my transition.

324
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:13,538
Damned!

325
00:31:15,771 --> 00:31:17,073
Do not grow old.

326
00:31:17,107 --> 00:31:20,109
Thou has begun my transition.

327
00:31:20,143 --> 00:31:22,846
Thou has begun my transition.

328
00:31:22,878 --> 00:31:25,415
Thou has begun my transition.

329
00:31:47,203 --> 00:31:48,940
Don't be a baby.

330
00:32:38,355 --> 00:32:44,562
You left me there to die.

331
00:32:45,529 --> 00:32:47,798
Now we can all be together.

332
00:33:20,731 --> 00:33:21,766
Hey!

333
00:33:22,933 --> 00:33:27,237
<i>-Black.
-Black, pink, black.</i>

334
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,905
I like pink, go with pink.

335
00:33:28,938 --> 00:33:32,075
<i>-Of course you do.
-You look great in it.</i>

336
00:33:33,643 --> 00:33:35,312
You want to wear
the black I know.

337
00:33:35,345 --> 00:33:36,980
<i>Of course I want
to wear the black.</i>

338
00:33:37,012 --> 00:33:38,381
I...

339
00:33:50,126 --> 00:33:52,162
<i>Yeah, where were we?</i>

340
00:33:52,194 --> 00:33:53,629
<i>Lucas, what just happened?</i>

341
00:33:53,663 --> 00:33:55,466
<i>Seems I've lost my
train of thought.</i>

342
00:33:57,099 --> 00:33:58,468
<i>Lucas?</i>

343
00:33:59,502 --> 00:34:01,304
<i>Lucas, you okay?</i>

344
00:34:01,338 --> 00:34:02,673
I gotta call you back.

345
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,936
Hello? Hey! Are you okay?

346
00:34:33,937 --> 00:34:35,305
Miss I...

347
00:34:48,318 --> 00:34:51,921
<i>-Hey.
-Lucas, you okay?</i>

348
00:34:51,955 --> 00:34:53,824
Yeah.

349
00:34:53,856 --> 00:34:55,379
<i>Damn it! Don't do
that to me all I heard</i>

350
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,659
<i>was this god-awful
screeching sound,</i>

351
00:34:56,693 --> 00:34:59,028
<i>I thought you're being attacked
or something.</i>

352
00:34:59,062 --> 00:35:01,565
<i>You need to come early.
When are you coming home?</i>

353
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:05,636
<i>Baby? Talk to me.</i>

354
00:35:07,736 --> 00:35:08,939
<i>Lucas?</i>

355
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,575
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

356
00:35:14,877 --> 00:35:17,414
Honey, I've got to call
you back, okay. I'm sorry.

357
00:35:17,446 --> 00:35:18,582
I love you.

358
00:35:27,256 --> 00:35:28,559
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

359
00:35:28,591 --> 00:35:30,827
I just hit a woman with my car.

360
00:35:30,861 --> 00:35:34,198
<i>You just hit a woman with
your car. Was she on foot?</i>

361
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:39,636
Yeah, she's in this road right
now, she's very badly hurt.

362
00:35:39,669 --> 00:35:41,104
She's very badly hurt.

363
00:35:41,136 --> 00:35:43,173
<i>Okay we got it. Where
are you right now?</i>

364
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:49,613
I'm on... I'm on...
I'm in the middle of nowhere.

365
00:35:49,646 --> 00:35:51,414
<i>Sir, sorry, you're breaking up.</i>

366
00:35:51,448 --> 00:35:53,716
I said, I'm in the middle
of nowhere!

367
00:35:56,586 --> 00:35:58,354
What do I do?

368
00:35:58,388 --> 00:36:01,024
<i>Okay, sir, I can't send an ambulance
if I don't know where you are.</i>

369
00:36:01,057 --> 00:36:02,225
<i>Is there a cross street?</i>

370
00:36:02,258 --> 00:36:04,961
No, there's... Um, there
is some lights up ahead.

371
00:36:04,995 --> 00:36:07,598
I think there is a town
a few miles ahead.

372
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:10,634
<i>Okay, so there's a town. Can you
tell me anything about where that...</i>

373
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:12,903
I can't find it on
my GPS, I'm sorry.

374
00:36:12,935 --> 00:36:15,288
<i>Okay, I'm passing you to
emergency medical, one moment.</i>

375
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:16,073
<i>Okay.</i>

376
00:36:23,713 --> 00:36:25,381
Hello, can you
hurry up please?

377
00:36:25,414 --> 00:36:28,951
<i>-Sir it's okay, are you there?
-Yes I'm here.</i>

378
00:36:28,984 --> 00:36:31,813
<i>I'm the certified EMT,
are you with her now?</i>

379
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:32,756
<i>Yup.</i>

380
00:36:32,789 --> 00:36:35,292
<i>Great, describe her
condition to me.</i>

381
00:36:35,325 --> 00:36:40,696
She's got a headed trauma

382
00:36:40,729 --> 00:36:42,598
and some broken bones.

383
00:36:42,631 --> 00:36:45,735
<i>-Multiple broken bones I think.
-Okay, anything else?</i>

384
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:51,241
She's got a compound
fracture of her knee. I think.

385
00:36:51,274 --> 00:36:53,410
<i>-Is she's breathing?
-Yup.</i>

386
00:36:53,443 --> 00:36:55,578
<i>-Is she conscious?
-I can't be clear.</i>

387
00:36:55,611 --> 00:36:58,180
<i>-You're doing fine.
-Sir? Lucas?</i>

388
00:36:58,214 --> 00:36:59,283
Yeah.

389
00:36:59,316 --> 00:37:01,518
<i>-Lucas?
-How do you know my name?</i>

390
00:37:01,551 --> 00:37:03,953
<i>We have your cell.</i>

391
00:37:03,986 --> 00:37:06,756
<i>-Right, of course.
-You need to trust us, okay?</i>

392
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:08,057
Okay.

393
00:37:08,091 --> 00:37:10,426
<i>She's in critical condition
and we can't seem to locate you</i>

394
00:37:10,459 --> 00:37:12,194
<i>so we like you to try
and move her.</i>

395
00:37:12,227 --> 00:37:13,615
<i>You want me to move her?</i>

396
00:37:13,616 --> 00:37:15,698
<i>You said there's a
town up ahead, right?</i>

397
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:30,980
All right, okay.
You're okay.

398
00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:45,328
Okay, I got her in the back
seat, we're are driving.

399
00:37:45,361 --> 00:37:47,664
I'm heading south.

400
00:37:47,696 --> 00:37:50,867
Are you still with me?
Can you hear me?

401
00:37:50,899 --> 00:37:52,602
<i>Yeah we're here just
stay with us, okay?</i>

402
00:37:52,635 --> 00:37:54,303
<i>You're doing just great, Lucas.</i>

403
00:37:54,336 --> 00:37:57,440
There's a lot of cracks in the
windshield, I cannot see very well.

404
00:37:57,473 --> 00:37:59,376
What I am looking for
when I get there?

405
00:37:59,408 --> 00:38:01,444
<i>-We're gonna talk you through it.
-All right, good.</i>

406
00:38:01,477 --> 00:38:06,082
I'm doing about 80 right now, I think
I can go faster, I'm gonna go faster.

407
00:38:06,115 --> 00:38:08,792
<i>Lucas? You need to
say something to her.</i>

408
00:38:08,793 --> 00:38:09,685
<i>Yeah.</i>

409
00:38:09,718 --> 00:38:11,888
<i>You know, in case
she can hear you.</i>

410
00:38:15,691 --> 00:38:17,193
I'll do everything I can.

411
00:38:23,499 --> 00:38:25,501
<i>Lucas, tell us when
you're close.</i>

412
00:38:25,535 --> 00:38:27,803
Okay, just got into town.

413
00:38:27,836 --> 00:38:33,542
There's shops, I see a barber shop. I
see there's a tattoo parlor, a church.

414
00:38:33,575 --> 00:38:34,882
<i>Do you see any people?</i>

415
00:38:34,883 --> 00:38:37,613
<i>Anyone on the side of the road?
Anyone you can ask for help?</i>

416
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:39,616
No, I don't see anyone,
there's nobody.

417
00:38:39,649 --> 00:38:41,112
<i>What about on coming traffic?</i>

418
00:38:41,113 --> 00:38:42,519
<i>Can you flash your lights
at the on coming traffic?</i>

419
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:44,521
No, I don't see anyone.

420
00:38:44,553 --> 00:38:46,824
<i>There's no on coming traffic?
Or there's no people?</i>

421
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:47,691
Okay, wait a minute.

422
00:38:47,723 --> 00:38:49,760
Okay, there's a sign up here.

423
00:38:49,792 --> 00:38:53,631
It's a hospital sign, I think I'm
pulling up into a local hospital.

424
00:39:02,671 --> 00:39:06,008
<i>Dispatch to vehicle. He's located
a medical facility of some sort.</i>

425
00:39:06,042 --> 00:39:08,979
<i>Be advised, no contact.
Local PD.</i>

426
00:39:09,011 --> 00:39:11,247
<i>Lucas we'll stay with you
till you've made contact.</i>

427
00:39:11,281 --> 00:39:13,750
<i>Just make sure you stay
with us until then.</i>

428
00:39:13,783 --> 00:39:16,819
Help! I need some help!

429
00:39:19,354 --> 00:39:20,723
Hello?

430
00:39:21,557 --> 00:39:23,260
Hello, I've an emergency.

431
00:39:24,526 --> 00:39:27,063
Is there anybody here?

432
00:39:27,097 --> 00:39:29,299
<i>Sir, is there some sort
of a problem?</i>

433
00:39:29,332 --> 00:39:30,834
<i>Did you run into a problem?</i>

434
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:33,336
<i>-Hello?
-Sir, is there a problem?</i>

435
00:39:33,368 --> 00:39:36,039
<i>Lucas? Lucas, can you...</i>

436
00:39:46,381 --> 00:39:47,885
What the fuck!

437
00:39:48,218 --> 00:39:50,153
Hey!

438
00:39:50,185 --> 00:39:53,055
<i>Sir, what's the problem here?</i>

439
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:56,193
<i>-We need you to talk to us.
-'Cause we can help.</i>

440
00:39:59,963 --> 00:40:02,531
<i>Sir?</i>

441
00:40:02,564 --> 00:40:05,998
<i>Sir, we need you on the line,
telling us what you see,</i>

442
00:40:05,999 --> 00:40:08,070
<i>we need you to
keep talking to us.</i>

443
00:40:08,104 --> 00:40:10,874
<i>-Sir?
-There's no one here.</i>

444
00:40:10,906 --> 00:40:13,743
<i>-It's abandoned or something.
-Okay, calm down, sir.</i>

445
00:40:13,776 --> 00:40:15,845
Is no one fucking here?

446
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:19,850
<i>Sir, I need you to calm down,
I'm sure there's someone near by.</i>

447
00:40:19,883 --> 00:40:24,187
<i>I'm gonna need you to find the nearest
surgeon, nurse, who ever you can find.</i>

448
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,356
<i>-I need you to find the closest person.
-There is no one here.</i>

449
00:40:26,388 --> 00:40:27,457
You understand?

450
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,993
I'm looking,
I do not see anyone.

451
00:40:30,026 --> 00:40:32,261
<i>Okay, how is the victim?</i>

452
00:40:32,294 --> 00:40:35,264
<i>-How is the victim?
-I don't know what's happening.</i>

453
00:40:35,298 --> 00:40:39,169
<i>Lucas, what about the girl?
How is she doing?</i>

454
00:40:48,678 --> 00:40:51,714
Shit. Fuck. No.

455
00:40:51,747 --> 00:40:54,483
<i>-Lucas how is she doing?
-Not good.</i>

456
00:40:54,517 --> 00:40:56,754
<i>Okay, what's happening?</i>

457
00:40:57,386 --> 00:41:01,091
Her leg is, is broken.

458
00:41:01,124 --> 00:41:03,227
She's bleeding really,
really bad.

459
00:41:06,229 --> 00:41:07,997
<i>All right. Focus.</i>

460
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:10,867
<i>Need to stop the bleeding. I need
you to look for anything you can use.</i>

461
00:41:10,899 --> 00:41:13,202
<i>-Like a tourniquet?
-Yes.</i>

462
00:41:13,236 --> 00:41:14,438
All right, I got it.

463
00:41:15,571 --> 00:41:17,707
<i>Okay, now wrap it
around her leg.</i>

464
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:21,444
All right,
how tight do I make it?

465
00:41:21,477 --> 00:41:23,247
<i>-Tight as you can.
-Okay.</i>

466
00:41:25,481 --> 00:41:29,352
Somethings happening, she's
moving, I don't know what to do.

467
00:41:29,385 --> 00:41:31,787
<i>-Sir, you need to focus.
-Okay, tell me what am I supposed to do.</i>

468
00:41:31,821 --> 00:41:34,024
<i>Lucas, is she responsive?</i>

469
00:41:34,057 --> 00:41:37,993
<i>-I don't know what that means.
-How is the breathing?</i>

470
00:41:38,026 --> 00:41:41,798
It's upsetting. There's blood
bubbling out of her mouth.

471
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:42,832
<i>He's losing her.</i>

472
00:41:42,865 --> 00:41:44,434
<i>I need to hear it.</i>

473
00:41:48,136 --> 00:41:51,575
<i>-Can you hear?
-Yes.</i>

474
00:41:51,607 --> 00:41:53,862
<i>Now listen carefully,
you have to intubate her,</i>

475
00:41:53,863 --> 00:41:55,144
<i>do you know what that means?</i>

476
00:41:55,178 --> 00:41:56,580
Stick a tube in her throat.

477
00:41:56,613 --> 00:41:58,748
<i>Exactly, now you wanna
find a specific kit for that.</i>

478
00:41:58,781 --> 00:42:00,884
<i>Pretty standard
stuff but it's specific.</i>

479
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,555
<i>-Lucas?
-What am I looking for?</i>

480
00:42:05,588 --> 00:42:07,591
<i>Package or a cabra bag,</i>

481
00:42:07,624 --> 00:42:09,359
<i>probably has a cubic meter
on the front.</i>

482
00:42:09,392 --> 00:42:10,594
<i>In variant shape or size.</i>

483
00:42:10,627 --> 00:42:11,895
What am I looking for?

484
00:42:11,928 --> 00:42:13,396
<i>It's best to look
for the word intubation.</i>

485
00:42:13,428 --> 00:42:16,232
<i>Or tracheal, endotracheal
or tracheal intubation.</i>

486
00:42:16,265 --> 00:42:17,834
<i>Any of those.</i>

487
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,503
<i>Or airway, airway aesthetician,
airway management kit, EMS airway.</i>

488
00:42:20,535 --> 00:42:22,137
<i>That's the one we use.</i>

489
00:42:22,171 --> 00:42:24,808
<i>Anything that has those words on
it, just tell me what you find.</i>

490
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:27,444
<i>Lucas, tell me what you find.</i>

491
00:42:27,477 --> 00:42:30,146
<i>You see anything that
looks like that?</i>

492
00:42:30,178 --> 00:42:32,514
<i>-Got it.
-Okay good, first open the kit.</i>

493
00:42:32,548 --> 00:42:35,886
<i>Look for a curved blade,
it's a metal hand tool.</i>

494
00:42:35,919 --> 00:42:37,921
There's no blade
it's just the tube.

495
00:42:37,953 --> 00:42:39,522
<i>-Just the tube?
-That's right.</i>

496
00:42:39,555 --> 00:42:41,057
<i>You'll have to do manually.</i>

497
00:42:41,089 --> 00:42:42,992
<i>First identify the glottis.</i>

498
00:42:43,026 --> 00:42:45,361
<i>It's a little squishy valve at the back
of the throat. Feel for the breath.</i>

499
00:42:45,394 --> 00:42:46,945
You want me to stick my
fingers in her throat?

500
00:42:46,946 --> 00:42:47,463
<i>Yes.</i>

501
00:42:47,497 --> 00:42:49,466
<i>You have to, it's the
intubation and have it ready.</i>

502
00:42:49,499 --> 00:42:52,435
<i>You need to hurry, you
have to do it now.</i>

503
00:42:57,807 --> 00:42:59,542
All right, locating it.

504
00:43:00,343 --> 00:43:01,278
Okay.

505
00:43:04,714 --> 00:43:08,352
<i>You must go farther Lucas, all
the way to the back of the tongue.</i>

506
00:43:11,988 --> 00:43:14,624
<i>-Now do it.
-Okay.</i>

507
00:43:14,656 --> 00:43:17,227
<i>Insert the tube.
Don't hesitate.</i>

508
00:43:18,593 --> 00:43:21,798
<i>Keep going... keep going.</i>

509
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:24,367
Fuck! She's biting me.
She's biting me.

510
00:43:24,399 --> 00:43:25,635
<i>What happened?</i>

511
00:43:27,202 --> 00:43:28,871
<i>-What's happening?
-Something is wrong.</i>

512
00:43:28,905 --> 00:43:30,607
<i>She's close to death.</i>

513
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,908
Who is this?

514
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:35,845
Hello? Who is this?

515
00:43:35,877 --> 00:43:39,082
<i>I'm the surgeon, Lucas. I've been
listening since you've arrived.</i>

516
00:43:39,115 --> 00:43:41,017
<i>-Okay!
-He's here to help.</i>

517
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:43,419
<i>Do you want to save her life?</i>

518
00:43:44,153 --> 00:43:45,687
Yes!

519
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,856
<i>Then whatever you do, do not
remove your hand from her throat.</i>

520
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:49,993
<i>Trust me the tube
is not set</i>

521
00:43:50,026 --> 00:43:53,663
<i>and is the only thing giving her oxygen,
the only thing keeping her alive.</i>

522
00:43:53,696 --> 00:43:55,498
<i>But it's also killing her.</i>

523
00:43:55,531 --> 00:43:57,701
<i>She's got several broken
ribs on her right side</i>

524
00:43:57,734 --> 00:43:59,736
<i>and the diaphragm is unable
to compress the lung.</i>

525
00:43:59,769 --> 00:44:03,138
<i>She can't breath, you
must compress the lung.</i>

526
00:44:03,171 --> 00:44:05,307
<i>-How do you know that?
-You must compress the lung.</i>

527
00:44:05,341 --> 00:44:07,644
<i>-I didn't tell you that.
-You must compress the lung.</i>

528
00:44:07,676 --> 00:44:10,579
No, look I need a minute here
I'm not really sure how...

529
00:44:10,613 --> 00:44:14,517
I must compress the lung. Fine.
What the fuck does that mean?

530
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:17,287
<i>First use your free hand
to expose the rib cage.</i>

531
00:44:19,321 --> 00:44:20,256
Okay.

532
00:44:22,758 --> 00:44:24,126
Okay, now what?

533
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,230
<i>-Slowly, carefully.
-You can do this Lucas.</i>

534
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:30,000
<i>-Now what?
-Make an incission.</i>

535
00:44:31,533 --> 00:44:33,502
<i>-An incission?
-Make an incission.</i>

536
00:44:34,604 --> 00:44:36,006
<i>You have to.</i>

537
00:44:46,749 --> 00:44:48,017
Okay.

538
00:44:49,084 --> 00:44:50,819
<i>You have the blade?</i>

539
00:44:50,852 --> 00:44:52,722
<i>Five to seven inches.</i>

540
00:44:52,754 --> 00:44:54,390
<i>Just below the rib cage.</i>

541
00:44:58,294 --> 00:44:59,162
<i>Slowly.</i>

542
00:45:00,595 --> 00:45:01,530
<i>Slowly.</i>

543
00:45:03,332 --> 00:45:04,234
<i>Slowly.</i>

544
00:45:09,405 --> 00:45:10,406
Okay.

545
00:45:11,207 --> 00:45:13,010
<i>-Find the lung.
-Okay</i>

546
00:45:31,093 --> 00:45:32,261
I got it.

547
00:45:33,296 --> 00:45:34,731
<i>Compress the lung.</i>

548
00:46:40,963 --> 00:46:42,198
Fuck!

549
00:46:45,568 --> 00:46:46,569
Fuck!

550
00:47:17,867 --> 00:47:18,834
Locked?

551
00:47:19,734 --> 00:47:20,669
Fuck!

552
00:47:21,571 --> 00:47:22,706
Fuck!

553
00:48:48,857 --> 00:48:49,792
Claire!

554
00:48:56,966 --> 00:48:59,502
<i>Claire's not here,
we're still on.</i>

555
00:48:59,535 --> 00:49:02,772
<i>We're going to have to
talk about this, Lucas.</i>

556
00:49:02,805 --> 00:49:04,007
I don't deserve this.

557
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,342
<i>Really?</i>

558
00:49:08,477 --> 00:49:10,814
<i>Why don't you elaborate?</i>

559
00:49:16,218 --> 00:49:18,588
She was out in the
middle of the road.

560
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,057
In the middle of
the fucking night.

561
00:49:21,089 --> 00:49:23,325
In the middle of nowhere.

562
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,862
How am I supposed
to have expected...

563
00:49:25,894 --> 00:49:26,795
I mean it's...

564
00:49:28,597 --> 00:49:30,867
It's an extraordinary
circumstance, okay?

565
00:49:30,899 --> 00:49:32,468
How am I supposed to be...

566
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:35,203
<i>-Lucas, it's okay.
-Absolutely okay.</i>

567
00:49:35,236 --> 00:49:36,539
Right!

568
00:49:36,571 --> 00:49:38,473
<i>You had no way of knowing.</i>

569
00:49:38,506 --> 00:49:40,309
<i>She was in the middle
of the road.</i>

570
00:49:40,343 --> 00:49:44,080
<i>In the middle of the fucking night.
In the middle of nowhere.</i>

571
00:49:44,113 --> 00:49:46,750
<i>It doesn't have to
be your fault, Lucas.</i>

572
00:49:47,383 --> 00:49:49,019
<i>Go be with your wife.</i>

573
00:49:51,453 --> 00:49:53,423
I can just walk out of here.

574
00:49:53,455 --> 00:49:55,457
<i>-Yeah.
-Yes.</i>

575
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:58,126
<i>-Yes.
-I can leave?</i>

576
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,297
<i>Yes.</i>

577
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:03,066
And you aren't
tricking me again?

578
00:50:03,098 --> 00:50:05,635
<i>No, Lucas.</i>

579
00:50:07,002 --> 00:50:08,404
<i>Find the locker room.</i>

580
00:50:08,437 --> 00:50:09,973
You'll see.

581
00:52:17,867 --> 00:52:21,803
Do I need to worry about
what's back there?

582
00:52:21,836 --> 00:52:26,008
<i>-No.
-Absolutely not.</i>

583
00:52:28,109 --> 00:52:29,578
<i>You were never here.</i>

584
00:52:32,247 --> 00:52:33,482
Okay.

585
00:52:37,218 --> 00:52:38,720
I'm hanging up now.

586
00:52:43,658 --> 00:52:45,127
<i>That's good, Lucas.</i>

587
00:52:50,164 --> 00:52:51,066
Good night.

588
00:54:08,843 --> 00:54:11,146
I'll take a beer and
a shot of whiskey.

589
00:54:12,381 --> 00:54:13,783
You forgot to
shut the door.

590
00:54:14,316 --> 00:54:15,285
No, I didn't.

591
00:54:16,218 --> 00:54:17,319
It didn't latch.

592
00:54:18,086 --> 00:54:19,821
Come on, Al!

593
00:54:19,854 --> 00:54:23,059
I've been on my feet for
hours, just give me a beer.

594
00:54:25,995 --> 00:54:26,930
First the door.

595
00:54:27,463 --> 00:54:28,631
Seriously?

596
00:54:29,097 --> 00:54:30,432
It's shut!

597
00:54:30,466 --> 00:54:32,335
It's fine.

598
00:54:32,368 --> 00:54:34,237
Sounds pretty sure
of herself, Al.

599
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:38,840
At the same time, being
sure is sort of a...

600
00:54:39,807 --> 00:54:41,577
fancy way of being lazy.

601
00:54:43,345 --> 00:54:44,914
You want to go
check the door?

602
00:54:46,214 --> 00:54:47,149
I mean...

603
00:54:48,883 --> 00:54:51,653
You can see from here it's
not shut all the way.

604
00:54:55,624 --> 00:54:57,126
I'll buy you a beer.

605
00:54:58,127 --> 00:54:59,495
Well...

606
00:54:59,528 --> 00:55:01,296
when you put it like that.

607
00:55:03,265 --> 00:55:04,500
All right, everybody.

608
00:55:04,533 --> 00:55:06,035
Put your hands on the tables.

609
00:55:06,068 --> 00:55:08,604
Cooperate and we'll get these
over with real fucking quick.

610
00:55:08,636 --> 00:55:11,272
-You, sit the fuck down!
-Hang on, buddy.

611
00:55:11,305 --> 00:55:14,209
Put your hands
on the table.

612
00:55:14,243 --> 00:55:18,247
What the fuck part of "put your hands on
the table" so hard for you to understand?

613
00:55:22,885 --> 00:55:26,555
Maybe before we all
get carried away here.

614
00:55:26,588 --> 00:55:28,825
We stop and think for a minute?

615
00:55:30,191 --> 00:55:31,993
-How's that sound?
-That sounds great.

616
00:55:32,026 --> 00:55:36,031
I know that one shitty bar
might look like just any other.

617
00:55:37,066 --> 00:55:38,968
But here's some free advice.

618
00:55:39,001 --> 00:55:41,703
Get back on whatever road
it was that brought you here.

619
00:55:41,736 --> 00:55:42,838
And keep moving.

620
00:55:43,705 --> 00:55:45,841
'Cause I guarantee you,

621
00:55:45,874 --> 00:55:48,077
that robbing this place,

622
00:55:48,109 --> 00:55:50,211
is way more trouble
than it's worth.

623
00:55:50,245 --> 00:55:52,848
This is not a robbery!

624
00:55:56,551 --> 00:55:57,787
This is my sister.

625
00:56:00,354 --> 00:56:01,857
Her name is Jessy.

626
00:56:03,357 --> 00:56:05,327
I know that she's in this town.

627
00:56:06,528 --> 00:56:08,698
Now, I don't want
to hurt anybody.

628
00:56:08,731 --> 00:56:11,367
But I'm telling you
right the fuck now,

629
00:56:11,399 --> 00:56:12,934
I'll do anything,

630
00:56:12,968 --> 00:56:16,239
to find her. Put your
fucking hands on the bar!

631
00:56:18,473 --> 00:56:19,676
Thank you!

632
00:56:21,209 --> 00:56:22,144
Anyone?

633
00:56:23,578 --> 00:56:25,048
Anybody see her?

634
00:56:30,785 --> 00:56:32,320
Where'd you get that tattoo?

635
00:56:35,591 --> 00:56:36,926
Did you get that around here?

636
00:57:01,048 --> 00:57:02,884
I don't know if I can kill you.

637
00:57:02,917 --> 00:57:05,088
But I bet that hurts
like a motherfucker!

638
00:57:07,522 --> 00:57:10,158
One more step!
One more fucking step.

639
00:57:18,499 --> 00:57:19,734
Last time,

640
00:57:19,767 --> 00:57:21,436
have you seen her?

641
00:57:23,638 --> 00:57:25,039
Yeah!

642
00:57:25,073 --> 00:57:26,242
Yeah?

643
00:57:26,274 --> 00:57:28,810
-Where?
-No where you can go, big shot.

644
00:57:29,778 --> 00:57:31,414
You'll fucking take me.

645
00:57:35,316 --> 00:57:36,818
Move, motherfucker!

646
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:40,555
Get in.

647
00:57:41,689 --> 00:57:42,657
Get in.

648
00:57:42,691 --> 00:57:43,959
And drive.

649
00:57:48,296 --> 00:57:49,464
Fucking go, man.

650
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:54,504
<i>Where are my road warriors at?</i>

651
00:57:58,774 --> 00:58:03,578
<i>You might be an old dog but you
still can learn some new tricks.</i>

652
00:58:03,611 --> 00:58:07,249
<i>So, what's stopping you?
You don't owe the world, shit!</i>

653
00:58:07,281 --> 00:58:10,218
<i>Each time live your own life and if
someone is dumb enough to stand in...</i>

654
00:58:10,252 --> 00:58:14,023
You don't get a lot of time before
the whole valley finds out, but,

655
00:58:14,856 --> 00:58:17,158
-you know that, don't you?
-Yeah.

656
00:58:17,191 --> 00:58:19,460
If I need you to, I'm going to
have you drive off the road.

657
00:58:19,493 --> 00:58:21,830
You don't want to do that.

658
00:58:21,863 --> 00:58:24,766
Looks like the desert,
but if you go out there,

659
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,435
you might not come back.

660
00:58:44,285 --> 00:58:46,254
What the fuck are
we doing here?

661
00:58:47,656 --> 00:58:49,125
It's around back.

662
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,542
-In there.
-In where? What?

663
00:59:08,542 --> 00:59:09,945
How do we get in?

664
00:59:13,281 --> 00:59:14,450
Through the door.

665
00:59:16,919 --> 00:59:19,555
Quit being so
fucking mysterious.

666
00:59:26,861 --> 00:59:27,963
Sorry.

667
00:59:29,031 --> 00:59:30,399
That's okay, Danny.

668
00:59:32,935 --> 00:59:34,503
How did you know my name?

669
00:59:39,441 --> 00:59:40,643
You're fucked, Danny.

670
00:59:42,544 --> 00:59:44,080
And you don't even know it yet.

671
01:00:16,111 --> 01:00:17,546
Don't you wanna see her?

672
01:00:20,881 --> 01:00:22,184
Yeah.

673
01:00:53,281 --> 01:00:54,417
Jessy?

674
01:00:55,984 --> 01:00:57,653
Jessy, it's me Danny.

675
01:00:57,685 --> 01:00:58,553
Danny?

676
01:00:59,321 --> 01:01:00,489
Danny, you...

677
01:01:03,925 --> 01:01:05,693
Are you really here?

678
01:01:05,727 --> 01:01:07,196
I'm really here.

679
01:01:10,966 --> 01:01:13,102
My God, you're hurt.

680
01:01:13,135 --> 01:01:14,535
It's nothing.

681
01:01:14,568 --> 01:01:16,571
It's nothing, I can't
believe I found you.

682
01:01:16,604 --> 01:01:18,540
How did you even get here?

683
01:01:19,607 --> 01:01:22,010
Man, Danny, you got old.

684
01:01:23,111 --> 01:01:25,513
I've been searching for
you for thirteen years.

685
01:01:26,948 --> 01:01:30,419
-You look absolutely incredible.
-Danny, wait.

686
01:01:31,185 --> 01:01:32,620
Yeah, what?

687
01:01:33,622 --> 01:01:35,558
How did you get here?

688
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,429
No. Danny, don't.

689
01:01:40,461 --> 01:01:42,864
-What the hell are you doing?
-What the hell are you doing?

690
01:01:42,897 --> 01:01:45,734
I'm saving you, I came to
get you the hell out of here.

691
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,569
Danny, I don't want to leave.

692
01:01:48,602 --> 01:01:51,740
You don't mean that, Jessy,
now get out of the fucking way.

693
01:01:51,772 --> 01:01:54,475
-She does mean it, Danny.
-Shut up.

694
01:01:54,508 --> 01:01:56,411
She's here because
she wants to be.

695
01:02:01,816 --> 01:02:03,985
Come on, Danny.

696
01:02:04,019 --> 01:02:06,088
It's time for you to leave.

697
01:02:23,171 --> 01:02:24,705
Danny!

698
01:02:24,738 --> 01:02:26,641
-Come on.
-Help.

699
01:02:29,176 --> 01:02:32,113
Get your fucking hands
off of me.

700
01:02:32,881 --> 01:02:34,417
Turn us around.

701
01:02:35,749 --> 01:02:37,218
God damn it!

702
01:02:42,723 --> 01:02:44,859
You're such an asshole.

703
01:02:44,892 --> 01:02:46,528
I'm okay with that.

704
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:49,164
Just let me be an asshole and
get you the hell out of here.

705
01:02:58,939 --> 01:03:00,275
Fuck!

706
01:03:02,711 --> 01:03:03,646
Danny.

707
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:07,450
You're not supposed
to go out there.

708
01:03:11,051 --> 01:03:13,823
If you do this, it's for you.

709
01:03:14,923 --> 01:03:16,658
It's not for me.

710
01:03:19,127 --> 01:03:20,429
I don't have a choice.

711
01:03:30,671 --> 01:03:32,073
I can't see anything.

712
01:03:32,106 --> 01:03:33,708
There's nothing to see.

713
01:03:35,776 --> 01:03:37,612
Fucking car is gonna fall apart.

714
01:03:37,646 --> 01:03:39,314
Don't slow down.

715
01:03:39,347 --> 01:03:41,450
You're not supposed
to be here.

716
01:03:44,084 --> 01:03:45,853
You can't stay here.

717
01:03:45,886 --> 01:03:47,089
You can't take me with you.

718
01:03:47,122 --> 01:03:48,557
I'm not leaving you behind.

719
01:03:50,024 --> 01:03:51,459
You need your gun.

720
01:03:53,627 --> 01:03:55,696
You have the gun, Danny?

721
01:03:55,729 --> 01:03:57,498
You might have to blow
my brains out too

722
01:03:57,531 --> 01:03:58,901
Stop it.

723
01:03:58,934 --> 01:04:01,169
No, you can't stop.

724
01:04:01,202 --> 01:04:03,171
You can't stop, Danny,
it's too late.

725
01:04:03,705 --> 01:04:05,407
Before they stop!

726
01:04:17,785 --> 01:04:18,886
Fuck.

727
01:04:18,919 --> 01:04:19,888
Danny.

728
01:04:23,758 --> 01:04:26,828
This place is made
for people like me.

729
01:04:26,861 --> 01:04:28,464
You shouldn't be here.

730
01:04:30,298 --> 01:04:32,600
I mean this whole
time growing up,

731
01:04:32,633 --> 01:04:36,271
didn't you ever think
about mom and dad?

732
01:04:36,303 --> 01:04:39,508
-What do you mean?
-Come on, Danny, tell the truth.

733
01:04:40,508 --> 01:04:43,812
Hey, you really never
thought it was my fault.

734
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:48,416
You can't...

735
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:50,586
blame yourself for
what happened.

736
01:04:50,618 --> 01:04:53,454
No. You're not listening
to what I'm saying.

737
01:04:53,488 --> 01:04:56,725
-You were a kid, we were...
-I killed them, Danny.

738
01:05:01,463 --> 01:05:04,098
I killed them because
I wanted to.

739
01:05:04,131 --> 01:05:06,668
Right now I'm here because
I wanna be here.

740
01:05:07,635 --> 01:05:11,706
This place found me
and I love it here.

741
01:05:23,318 --> 01:05:25,553
Jessy help me! Jessy!

742
01:05:34,261 --> 01:05:35,964
You should have let me go.

743
01:05:35,997 --> 01:05:37,933
I just wanted to save you.

744
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,469
Jessy!

745
01:05:45,106 --> 01:05:46,274
Jessy!

746
01:06:42,897 --> 01:06:44,333
What are you looking at?

747
01:07:01,415 --> 01:07:03,517
Well, I'm looking
forward to that.

748
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,654
-Hey!
-You can leave your stuff everywhere.

749
01:07:05,687 --> 01:07:07,789
-Hey, sweetie!
. Hey, honey.

750
01:07:07,821 --> 01:07:10,992
I'm so glad we got to do this
before you start school.

751
01:07:11,024 --> 01:07:12,461
-Me too.
-Whoa.

752
01:07:12,493 --> 01:07:14,129
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, okay?

753
01:07:14,162 --> 01:07:16,497
We still have this
one last weekend to have fun.

754
01:07:16,531 --> 01:07:18,400
Play games and puzzles.

755
01:07:18,432 --> 01:07:21,536
Make s'mores,
with our little girl.

756
01:07:22,636 --> 01:07:24,372
It's just so exciting, sweety.

757
01:07:27,809 --> 01:07:31,812
<i>Well, we all know the past
can be piece of shit sometimes.</i>

758
01:07:31,845 --> 01:07:35,416
<i>But when it catches up to you,
you better be ready.</i>

759
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:40,021
<i>Keep your eyes on the road
and let that engine roar so loud</i>

760
01:07:40,053 --> 01:07:43,858
<i>that you can't hear those
demons screaming in your ear.</i>

761
01:07:43,892 --> 01:07:46,962
<i>Lock your doors,
make those tires burn.</i>

762
01:07:46,995 --> 01:07:50,899
<i>Tell your family you love
them and kiss the past goodbye.</i>

763
01:07:50,932 --> 01:07:53,435
<i>For once and for all.</i>

764
01:07:53,468 --> 01:07:57,038
<i>Because every road
gotta end somewhere.</i>

765
01:07:57,071 --> 01:07:58,640
<i>Am I right?</i>

766
01:08:21,695 --> 01:08:23,265
All right.

767
01:08:23,297 --> 01:08:25,266
Sure looks better
in the pictures.

768
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:27,101
Got some charm.

769
01:08:27,135 --> 01:08:30,571
Listen why don't you go unpack and
we'll have dinner ready in an hour.

770
01:08:30,605 --> 01:08:31,607
Cool.

771
01:08:32,473 --> 01:08:34,176
I'm gonna open some wine.

772
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:55,597
Don't you think she's ready?

773
01:08:56,463 --> 01:08:57,999
Of course not.

774
01:08:58,833 --> 01:08:59,935
Is anyone ever?

775
01:09:01,401 --> 01:09:04,839
At a certain point we just gonna
have to trust the future, right?

776
01:09:06,673 --> 01:09:10,311
Let's hope that she
learn to believe in herself.

777
01:09:10,345 --> 01:09:12,713
And that she'll
stand-up for herself.

778
01:09:14,248 --> 01:09:15,650
She will.

779
01:09:17,351 --> 01:09:18,986
Question is, are you ready?

780
01:09:21,922 --> 01:09:23,492
I'll be fine.

781
01:09:41,441 --> 01:09:44,879
Hold on, honey,
let your dad get it.

782
01:09:44,913 --> 01:09:48,049
<i>This next one might be familiar
to some of you.</i>

783
01:09:48,082 --> 01:09:49,316
Who is it?

784
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:51,785
<i>For all of you out there, who
don't want the night to end.</i>

785
01:09:51,819 --> 01:09:53,922
<i>So, go ahead,
make some mistakes...</i>

786
01:09:53,954 --> 01:09:55,089
Hello?

787
01:09:55,123 --> 01:09:58,026
<i>You can always get it right
the next time.</i>

788
01:10:17,611 --> 01:10:18,613
No one's there.

789
01:10:42,235 --> 01:10:43,771
What is it?

790
01:10:45,272 --> 01:10:46,540
Honey, call the cops.

791
01:10:46,574 --> 01:10:48,777
-What?
-Call the cops now, go!

792
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:51,613
-Okay.
-Dad, what is it?

793
01:10:54,481 --> 01:10:56,450
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

794
01:10:56,484 --> 01:10:58,285
Someone's trying to
break into the house.

795
01:10:58,319 --> 01:10:59,354
<i>What's the address?</i>

796
01:10:59,387 --> 01:11:01,222
It's 6255, Bethel lane.

797
01:11:01,254 --> 01:11:04,892
<i>Just take a deep breath, we're gonna
be there in about thirty minutes.</i>

798
01:11:04,926 --> 01:11:06,328
What?

799
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:08,195
<i>You are going to be fine.</i>

800
01:11:13,101 --> 01:11:14,836
-Dad?
-Darryl?

801
01:11:15,302 --> 01:11:16,337
Dad.

802
01:11:21,642 --> 01:11:23,177
It's gonna take thirty minutes.

803
01:11:28,783 --> 01:11:30,151
Dad, what's going on?

804
01:11:32,119 --> 01:11:33,588
We gotta get out of here.
Come here.

805
01:11:52,774 --> 01:11:54,042
What do you want?

806
01:11:58,512 --> 01:11:59,680
What do you want?

807
01:12:36,883 --> 01:12:38,386
Why are they doing this?

808
01:12:47,328 --> 01:12:48,763
What about Jim?

809
01:14:42,342 --> 01:14:45,146
What the fuck do you want
from us? Please what?

810
01:15:12,772 --> 01:15:14,242
I'm sorry.

811
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:19,079
What are you talking about,
baby? What are you talking about?

812
01:15:19,113 --> 01:15:20,171
I'll give you anything you want.

813
01:15:20,172 --> 01:15:23,552
Let me know what I can do
to make this right, please.

814
01:15:27,922 --> 01:15:29,524
My God!

815
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:35,363
You told...

816
01:15:35,395 --> 01:15:36,864
I'm sorry.

817
01:15:38,531 --> 01:15:39,900
I'm sorry.

818
01:15:39,934 --> 01:15:45,906
No, no. I could not.
No, no, Kate. No.

819
01:15:56,851 --> 01:15:59,521
No! No!

820
01:16:04,057 --> 01:16:05,359
No...

821
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,334
She was innocent.

822
01:16:14,368 --> 01:16:16,204
She was innocent.

823
01:16:21,574 --> 01:16:23,845
Jim, go!

824
01:16:23,878 --> 01:16:25,914
Go! Go!

825
01:16:55,609 --> 01:16:56,611
Bitch!

826
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:11,959
What do you want from us?

827
01:17:14,095 --> 01:17:16,131
What do you want from us?

828
01:17:17,731 --> 01:17:18,966
Go!

829
01:17:27,274 --> 01:17:28,142
Go!

830
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:52,333
Thank you.

831
01:17:53,034 --> 01:17:55,370
Thank you.

832
01:18:03,843 --> 01:18:05,346
I'm sorry.

833
01:19:14,949 --> 01:19:16,818
Hey! Get up!

834
01:19:21,321 --> 01:19:22,757
Help.

835
01:19:53,486 --> 01:19:55,123
We let you go!

836
01:20:05,498 --> 01:20:07,836
Fuck you!

837
01:21:19,672 --> 01:21:21,341
What have we done?

838
01:21:35,623 --> 01:21:36,758
Fuck!

839
01:21:49,336 --> 01:21:51,905
Shit, run!

840
01:21:58,912 --> 01:22:00,248
Mich!

841
01:22:15,229 --> 01:22:16,597
What the fuck!

842
01:22:30,944 --> 01:22:32,280
What the fuck!

843
01:22:53,033 --> 01:22:55,270
Un-fucking-believable.

844
01:23:08,882 --> 01:23:11,385
Fuck!

845
01:23:11,418 --> 01:23:15,022
-What about Shane?
-Fuck Shane. Shane was an asshole!

846
01:23:31,204 --> 01:23:32,707
What the fuck is that thing?

847
01:23:37,177 --> 01:23:38,579
Shit!

848
01:23:47,721 --> 01:23:48,990
Fuck this shit!

849
01:24:36,136 --> 01:24:37,605
Let's go home.

850
01:24:44,744 --> 01:24:46,613
<i>Regret and remorse.</i>

851
01:24:46,646 --> 01:24:50,350
<i>Amends and atonement,
that's life, right?</i>

852
01:24:50,383 --> 01:24:52,485
<i>This next one is for you.</i>

853
01:24:52,519 --> 01:24:57,056
<i>For all you lost souls racing
down that long road to redemption.</i>

854
01:24:57,089 --> 01:25:00,026
<i>And all you sinners running
from your past,</i>

855
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:04,198
<i>but heading straight into that
bitter darkness up ahead.</i>

856
01:25:04,230 --> 01:25:09,636
<i>We're all on that same endless highway,
the one with no name and no exits.</i>

857
01:25:09,669 --> 01:25:12,873
<i>Looking for a way out of
tonight and into tomorrow.</i>

858
01:25:12,905 --> 01:25:15,569
<i>Well, they're gonna
try to stop you,</i>

859
01:25:15,570 --> 01:25:18,111
<i>but you got to say
'fuck it' and keep moving.</i>

860
01:25:18,145 --> 01:25:19,946
<i>'Cause this is your highway.</i>

861
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:22,415
<i>And the day might
just be the day,</i>

862
01:25:22,449 --> 01:25:25,453
<i>you finally out run
those wicked demons.</i>

863
01:25:25,485 --> 01:25:27,287
<i>Once and for all.</i>

864
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:31,391
<i>And I'll be right here with you,
making sure you get where you're going.</i>

865
01:25:31,425 --> 01:25:35,797
<i>Because in the end we're all
just trying to find our way home.</i>

866
01:25:36,696 --> 01:25:37,765
<i>Right?</i>

867
01:25:38,899 --> 01:25:40,468
Rough night?

868
01:25:44,204 --> 01:25:45,506
Yeah
