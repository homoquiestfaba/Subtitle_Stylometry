As you can see,

7
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,730
our Cultural Attache Department
has extended our ESL program

8
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:28,478
to the rest of Bulgaria
with extraordinary results.

9
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,947
Sofia Private School
has the best scores in the country.

10
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,611
I think you should give
each and every one of yourselves

11
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,110
a round of applause
for this extraordinary accomplishment.

12

So how's the good doctor this evening?

20
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,737
Happy to have the company
of my old friend.

21
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,423
Attractive, huh?

22
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,716
Yes, very.

23
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,926
So what's it been now, Robert, hmm?

24
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,519
Three years? Four?

25
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,648
It's been four years today, actually.

26
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,519
Look around, my friend.

27
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,734
If you wanted to,

28
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,075
you could go home
with a different one every night.

29
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,035
It's not exactly my style,
you know that.

30
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,327
What, then?

31
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,825

32
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,792
Ah, you're still punishing yourself

33
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,874
about the accident, are you?

34
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,593
Oh, Robert, you need to
deal with it, my friend.

35
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:25,088
I know what carrying that kind
of burden around can do to you.

36
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,512
I appreciate your concern as always,

37
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,853
but as long as I stay here
in Eastern Europe,

38
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,849
all of that stays back in New York.
Out of sight, out of mind.

39
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,350
Well, that's...

40
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,440
It doesn't work that way, my friend.

41
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,562
I think you need therapy.

42
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,482
I'll tell you what I do need.
I need a drink.

43
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:45,947
Where's our waitress?

So, Vicki, how are we today, hmm?

50
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,975
I'm okay.

51
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,478
Good.

52
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,731
Any more memory lapses, hmm?

53
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,445
Any more bad dreams?

54
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,915
I sense that you're
avoiding conversation today.

55
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:06,333
Perhaps you'll indulge me
in a brief activity, hmm?

56
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:19,809
It's a hypnotic technique we use
to open a patient's senses,

57
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,102
to tap into the imagination.

58
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:27,021
It's really quite harmless.
You can trust me.

59
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,610
You're not afraid of a simple
little blindfold, are you?

60
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,618
You can remove it
whenever you want to.

61
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,032
I promise.

62
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:45,919
And just relax.

63
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,713
Breathe and relax.

64
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:55,056
Now, I asked you about your dreams.

65
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,770
Any recently that you recall?

66
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,062
Yes, one.

67
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,689
Go on.

68
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,815
It's embarrassing, actually.

69
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:17,738
It's like a re-creation
from something I read long ago.

70
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:22,417
<i>Have you read Hubert Selby, Jr.,</i>
<i>Last Exit to Brooklyn?</i>

71
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,661
No, I can't say I have.

72
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,670
There is this part at the end

73
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:35,423
where this junkie chick
climbs into an abandoned car

74
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,092
and lets every guy
in the neighborhood screw her.

75
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:45,896
Every scumbag and lowlife
for miles around get in this line,

76
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,609
and the line
goes around the block.

77
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,356
How did it affect you, the scene,
when you read it?

78
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,659
At the time, it was disturbing.

79
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,573
But in this dream...

80
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,460
I'm the girl in the abandoned car.

81
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,427
I can never see their faces.

82
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:19,300
They're hidden by keffiyehs,

83
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:23,270
you know, those Arabic scarves.

84
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,730
They're pulled over their faces,

85
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,475
and every one of those men...

86
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,561
Go on.

87
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,819
They're all the same man.

88
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,274
Have you thought who he might be...

89
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,779
the man wearing the keffiyeh?

- What?

as you answered my questions.

I did?

98
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,479

What did I say?

99
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:13,775
Well, you were away
for several moments.

100
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,189
You don't remember
what we were talking about?

101

with us today then?

111
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,483
Yes, that's correct.

112
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,227

by the way.

113
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,479
It better be.

00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,573

you capitalize the first letter.

Yes. Black ops.

A lot of fuss in the press
about it here, though.

146

Our agents were good guys,
really great.

147
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,958
They've been able to infiltrate

not able to get into Sofia, ever.

152
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,715
Not then, not now.

153
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:33,345
I gotta talk to you about
what's going on with Sofia today.

154
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:35,514
I thought it was dead in the water.

155
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,062
Yeah. Seemed to be

156
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,234
until yesterday.

157
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,365
Yeah, I read about this this morning.

158
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:51,409
Hmm. I've been on the phone all night
with the States dealing with this.

159
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,624
Turns out Washington
knows all about the fella

160
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,834
this vigilante terminated.

161
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,750
He was a target
of highest priority for us,

162
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,794
and we've never been able
to get anywhere near him.

163
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,794
Oh, I guess the guys back home
are feeling some heat from higher up,

164
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:09,138
and now they want to find out
exactly what's going on here.

165
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:14,102
So I have been specifically instructed
to, quote, unquote, persuade you

166
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,391
to take charge of
the investigation here.

167
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,388
Why me?

168
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,766
Because you are exemplary.

169
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,517
- [scoffs]
- No, seriously.

170
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,487
That's what your FBI friends called you.
They said you were exemplary.

171
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:28,403
I've never had anybody say
I was exemplary in my whole life.

172
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,234
Leaving law enforcement

173
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,862
was a well-thought-out decision
on my part, ambassador.

174
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,125
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

175
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,872
I know. They told me about that,
and I'm truly sorry.

176
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,214
Come on.

177
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:48,086
But it seems that the ramifications of this
are very big--politically, globally.

178
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:55,136
See, these vigilantes have taken on
a whole string of high-profile targets,

179
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,138
targets your FBI guys
told me on the phone last night

180
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:02,017
that they've been tracking for years
and could never get a look at.

181
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,356
So now they need to know

182
