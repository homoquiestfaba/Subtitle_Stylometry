1
00:00:02,287 --> 00:00:04,403
- Common marker.
- How about me, James?

2
00:00:04,567 --> 00:00:06,956
- You're doing great.
- Thanks, James. Thanks.

3
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:09,237
- Mark.
- Well, I've...

4
00:00:09,847 --> 00:00:12,566
All right, serious Lex.
Serious Lex. Here we go.

5
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:14,321
All right.

6
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,081
I'm twitching.

7
00:00:17,247 --> 00:00:18,919
Right there.

8
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:21,956
This time a little better.
Go ahead, Kristin.

9
00:00:24,327 --> 00:00:26,761
- Whoa!
- A little smaller. Here we go.

10
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:29,361
- Sorry. Okay.
- Here we go, here we go, and...

11
00:00:30,127 --> 00:00:31,845
Manage to prove it.

12
00:00:32,007 --> 00:00:34,601
The other sheriff may have looked
the other way.

13
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:36,120
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,841
It was good up to there, wasn't it?

15
00:00:39,847 --> 00:00:43,965
I just wanna say
that I'm really sorry, and...

16
00:00:44,727 --> 00:00:47,924
This really sucks.
Hold on, let me do this again. Sorry.

17
00:00:48,647 --> 00:00:51,115
I came here...
Fuck yourself.

18
00:00:51,287 --> 00:00:54,996
I came here to tell you I talked to...
Don't laugh. Keep going. We're good.

19
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:57,840
I came here to tell you
I talked to Walden.

20
00:00:58,007 --> 00:00:59,360
I'm not laughing.

21
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:02,325
I came here to tell you I talked to...
Just can't get it.

22
00:01:03,407 --> 00:01:04,920
Tom's killing me.

23
00:01:05,087 --> 00:01:07,078
All right, here we go.
You're killing me.

24
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:09,636
Put your arm around me,
you son of a...

25
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:13,242
I came here to tell you
I talked to Walden.

26
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,840
He won't budge.

27
00:01:15,287 --> 00:01:17,403
You wouldn't be keeping secrets
from me...?

28
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:20,843
Is that really me? That's never
happened before. I'm so sorry.

29
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:23,157
Excuse me just for a second.

30
00:01:25,047 --> 00:01:27,720
Hey, I love you.

31
00:01:29,847 --> 00:01:31,838
It's our music.

32
00:01:34,047 --> 00:01:36,242
That's very embarrassing.

33
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:37,840
Perfect timing, dude.

34
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:42,802
Sure, son, we're an alien race,
but this alien...

35
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:45,242
That's not right. Flawed.

36
00:01:46,647 --> 00:01:48,399
It's okay, I can pull it together.

37
00:01:51,607 --> 00:01:53,643
I'm falling over.

38
00:01:55,807 --> 00:01:57,479
That depends...

39
00:01:57,647 --> 00:01:59,399
If I make a mess or not.

40
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:01,842
Shit! We didn't have to cut.

41
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:07,879
- Yeah! You know what?
- Not that.

42
00:02:08,047 --> 00:02:11,084
You know what, you...? Get out of here,
you punk! Get out of here!

43
00:02:11,687 --> 00:02:13,917
I just... This is good.

44
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:18,080
Really.

45
00:02:18,247 --> 00:02:19,726
Really.

46
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:22,397
It's Alison Sanders.

47
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:24,398
Yeah, Alison Sanders.

48
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:26,080
- Whoa!
- Cool!

49
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:27,919
- All right.
- Let's do it again.

50
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:30,883
He may go to Smallville...

51
00:02:31,607 --> 00:02:32,881
...High.

52
00:02:33,047 --> 00:02:34,685
Hi.

53
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:36,765
- Jonathan.
- Tom. Good to meet you.

54
00:02:36,927 --> 00:02:38,360
Nice to meet you.

55
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:41,966
That really cute guy that works
at the phone company.

56
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:45,164
You mean, the Hungarian guy
with the toy scooter.

57
00:02:45,327 --> 00:02:47,204
Oh, shit.

58
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:53,846
And I'm tired of watching
every little nick and...

59
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,918
- Cranny.
- Nook and cranny.

60
00:02:59,607 --> 00:03:01,518
Don't fuss.

61
00:03:03,047 --> 00:03:04,400
Damn it!

62
00:03:05,247 --> 00:03:07,363
- Are you all right, sweetie?
- Yeah.

63
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:19,839
Let me get some of that.

64
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:22,475
And cut.

65
00:03:25,007 --> 00:03:28,602
What the hell are you guys
laughing at over there?

66
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:32,563
- You have hair in your face.
- I always do.

67
00:03:32,727 --> 00:03:34,843
- There's nothing I can do about it.
- We could...

68
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,316
They're just pieces. You put them
all together in the editing room.

69
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:39,924
Yeah.

70
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:46,682
Father! Hello, Daddy.

71
00:03:46,847 --> 00:03:49,919
- B mark.
- How would you like to consider a...?

72
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:53,042
Do you believe in ghosts?

73
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:55,601
No.

74
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:57,997
- Damn!
- Cut. Print.

75
00:03:58,727 --> 00:04:00,365
You're weird.

76
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:04,481
Dr. Walden, you're confused.

77
00:04:04,647 --> 00:04:07,480
I won't let anyone stop me.

78
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:18,239
Cut.

79
00:04:20,847 --> 00:04:23,077
And cut.

80
00:04:26,487 --> 00:04:28,364
I can't look at him. I can't...

81
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:35,958
Antagonized... Oh, damn it.

82
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,161
I seem to recall a young man
who defied his father.

83
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:41,079
I remember a certain young man who...

84
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:45,035
This has to be a certain temperature.
Now I have to be serious. Here we go.

85
00:04:45,207 --> 00:04:46,481
And set.

86
00:04:46,727 --> 00:04:48,718
Holy chocolate starfish...

87
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:50,684
...Batman.

88
00:04:50,847 --> 00:04:52,121
Mark.

89
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:55,597
- Does it hurt?
- Not now.

90
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,844
Shit.

91
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:02,039
Sorry, dude. I had to do it once.

92
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:11,004
Maybe some of us wanna celebrate
the day you came into our lives.

93
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:16,727
I never thought of it that way.

94
00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:19,717
Make a wish.

95
00:05:23,527 --> 00:05:25,279
It's hot.

96
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:27,679
- One second.
- Okay.

97
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:31,517
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,044
- Cut.
- Did you hear the...?

99
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,203
- I'm sorry.
- And cut.

100
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,966
Cut.
