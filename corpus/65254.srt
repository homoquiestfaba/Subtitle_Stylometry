1
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:17,258
I want to tell you about the craziest
white man I ever met.

2
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,321
We go way back, Eddie and me.

3
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,458
Met in the army.

4
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,526
Hadn't heard from him in a while
before l got his postcard.

5
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,673
Never been to visit before.

6
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,637
Postcard says you were
bringing me a surprise.

7
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,646
ls that it?

8
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,740
- Yeah.
- I appreciate it, Eddie.

9
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:41,378
I really do.
Always loved that bike.

10
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,716
l'm sorry it broke down.

11
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:48,056
Hey, it's an old Indian,
just like me.

12
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:53,063
It's not the end of the world.
What are you gonna do, kill yourself?

13
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:55,566
That's what I'm here for, Johnny.

14
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:01,436
Postcard didn't say
when you were coming...

15
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,839
so I lit a fire last night.

16
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,706
Smoke told me when you'd be here.

17
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,648
- I've been watching for you.
- You know why I came to see you?

18
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,243
I got a pretty good idea, amigo.

19
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,380
What good did we do?

20
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,584
Nothing!

21
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,253
We used to do it real good, Johnny.

22
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,262
Killing.

23
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,629
The memories--

24
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,464
they haunt me, Johnny.

25
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,765
Haunt me, Johnny!

26
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,610
That's why you got the medal, Eddie.

27
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,417
Hey.

28
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,453
l had this dream about the Devil.

29
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:54,488
He reserved a whole floor of hell...

30
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,120
just for me.

31
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,130
What do you think about that?

32
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,527
Tell me more about your dream.

33
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,539
Oh, my dream.

34
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,777
l think about it a lot.

35
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,510
l think about it a lot.

36
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,518
Checking out!

37
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,024
Enough.

38
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,092
That's why l'm here, Johnny--
to kill myself.

39
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,403
l need your okay.

40
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,173
l need your okay, man.

41
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,176
You know?

42
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,605
Eddie...

43
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:53,445
you may not need my okay.

44
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:12,332
Look at this. Look at this!
He could have killed me.

45
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,600
What the fuck is wrong with this guy?

46
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,644
Hey, you ! Cycle man!

47
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,656
What in the hell
are you shooting at, boy?

48
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:35,660
- You damn near killed us back there.
- Leave me alone.

49
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,322
- I don't want any trouble.
- What l think you need to do, son...

50
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,663
is apologize to me and my brothers
for almost killing us.

51
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:48,001
Hey, Johnny!
What do you think?

52
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,572
- Maybe they can do it.
- Who the fuck are you talking to?

53
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,347
My best friend.

54
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:04,654
l'll tell you what, mister.

55
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:09,286
Why don't you just give us
this here motorcycle...

56
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:13,423
and maybe me and my brothers will just
forget about this whole incident.

57
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,434
No, no, no, no, no.

58
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,596
That's a gift for my friend.

59
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,937
Hey.

60
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,741
You really shouldn't be driving
the way you are, mister.

61
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,840
Please. Leave me alone.

62
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,442
And you, get off of my bike.

63
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,977
Whatever you say, chief.
So sorry, man.

64
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,330
Come on !
Get you some!

65
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,670
- You can do it.
- Get up.

66
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,548
Yeah !

67
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,752
Look at that.
I'm fresh out.

68
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,521
Hey, there's a car coming.

69
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,787
Wait. Slow down, Vern.
Wait a minute.

70
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,833
Vern, slow down.
Somebody is in trouble.

71
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,028
Yeah, and it's none
of our business.

72
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,037
Vern, they're gonna kill him.

73
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,630
- lt's just Vern and Dottie.
- They ain't gonna say nothing.

74
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,006
-They better not.
-l don't want trouble with the Hogans...

75
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:34,012
and if you're smart,
you'Il keep your mouth shut too.

76
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:40,517
- l'm putting this in the damn truck.
- I'll give you a hand.

77
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:44,454
- You make sure he's dead first.
- Give me the gun, Petey.

78
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,893
- Petey, give him the gun.
- l can do it, Matt.

79
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,089
You go on.
l can do it, all right?

80
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:55,429
- All right, Jess. Let him do it.
- Don't miss.

81
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,873
- Come on, hurry up, man.
- What are you waiting for?

82
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,606
- Let's go!
- l'm sorry, mister.

83
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:21,819
- Damn! l didn't think he had it in him.
- Me neither.

84
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,734
Come on.

85
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,651
Thanks, Buddy.

86
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,348
- Where's Dottie today?
- Late, as usual.

87
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:54,154
Oh. Well, could you give her
these for me?

88
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,456
- What's that?
- These.

89
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,191
Oh, Buddy, that is so sweet.

90
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,790
- She's really gonna like those.
- Really?

91
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:05,598
WelI, Rhonda, do you think
Dottie would go out with me?

92
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:08,765
She likes you, Buddy.
Why don't you ask her?

93
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:13,803
All right. l will.

94
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,109
l better get my ass in gear...

95
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,116
or they're gonna discontinue the run.

96
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:22,746
There's one passenger out there,
and it's military. Half price.

97
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,814
Oh, could you teIl her
I'm sorry l missed her?

98
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,951
- Sure wiIl.
- See you, Pop.

99
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,962
It's not my turn.
l paid last time.

100
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,332
What do you say you sit on my lap
and we talk about...

101
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,341
the first thing that pops up?

102
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:49,376
Let's split this hole.

103
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,382
Keep the change, sweet thing.

104
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,651
Ow! Give me frostbite.

105
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,382
- You're late.
- The shortcut through the dry lake...

106
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,361
we saw this poor boy
getting the mess beat out of him...

107
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,866
- by the Hogans, and I think--
- We saw a flying saucer. Unbelievable!

108
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:10,333
Please. Please!

109
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,701
Just start fiIling
the ketchup bottles.

110
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,263
And Buddy left these for you, Dottie.

111
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,969
- lsn't he sweet?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

112
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,377
l thought you said
they cancelled his run.

113
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,415
Look what he got me, Vern.

114
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:28,283
Says here the army may be
conducting maneuvers around here.

115
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,288
Army's not coming, Pop...

116
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,824
and the flyboys have gone too.

117
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,452
Should have sold this place
when l was a kid--

118
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,190
before they put in the interstate.

119
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,459
Here's a fresh cup, Mr. Early.

120
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,024
Oh, thank you, Rhonda.
Thank you.

121
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,536
My Bertie should be here
any time now.

122
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:48,937
She's been away
finding me a job as a handyman.

123
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:52,102
She should be here any time.
Any time.

124
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:55,079
l wish you'd teach me some patience,
Mr. Early.

125
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:59,709
Oh, Rhonda, patience is always there
waiting for you.

126
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,719
Well, that is good to hear.

127
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:07,749
You know, Bertie is gone three years
now, and he is stilI waiting.

128
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,957
He's my kind of guy.

129
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,431
Little old for you, isn't he?

130
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:44,393
- Way to go, Petey, man.
- We didn't think you had it in you.

131
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,159
Two shots in the head.
That's my littIe brother.

132
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,224
- Ain't no big deal.
- l wonder where that son of a bitch...

133
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,292
was from-- what planet.

134
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,395
Petey, what's that thing worth,
that .45?

135
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:57,169
- Four hundred, maybe more.
- All right. Run that over to Eli's.

136
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,438
Tell Lester if he don't give you
four and a half for it...

137
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,946
l'll shove it up his brother's
tight little ass.

138
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,414
l don't know.
They might enjoy that.

139
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,417
Hey, you guys, hurry it up.

140
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,476
I don't want to be late
and get Ramsey all riled up.

141
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:11,148
- Come on, Petey. You need the practice.
- Bullshit.

142
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,157
l'm every bit as good
at collecting as you are.

143
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,386
We'll see about that.
Hey, good morning, y'all.

144
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,225
lt's time to pass the plate.

145
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,460
l'm afraid we're a little short
this month.

146
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:25,595
Oh. Count it. And I'm afraid y'alI are
gonna have a serious problem then.

147
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,662
Yeah, like a goddamn broken arm.

148
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,641
You can't take
the Lord's name in vain, sonny.

149
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,802
Sorry, ma'am.

150
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:36,473
Look, Mrs. Howard, l don't want Petey
to get any more upset than he is...

151
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:40,383
and end up breaking both of his arms.

152
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,545
Oh, no.
Not that, Henry.

153
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:48,082
Well, looky here. lt's a miracle.
HalIelujah!

154
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,958
- You all take it easy now.
- Have a nice day, ma'am.

155
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,089
- Why did you do that?
- Oh, by the way.

156
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,599
Saturday night l got this date
with this cute little sinner.

157
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,501
CouId l get some clean sheets
this time?

158
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,766
- l gotta lie down.
- Lord, Lord, oh, Lord.

159
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,402
That was the reverend's money.

160
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,948
Come on, let's see.

161
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,611
- Pure this time, right?
- Hundred percent.

162
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,521
Good.

163
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,558
Anybody seen my idiot sons?

164
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:56,527
You know those boys, Gunney.
You just-just can't count on them.

165
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,756
Goddamn it.

166
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,129
l told them to be here.
Goddamn it!

167
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,665
It looks like the plane's on time
for a change.

168
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,551
We're sitting ducks.

169
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,746
Count's good.

170
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,755
- You haven't lost your touch, Chang.

Good morning, Dad.

What about you? You're on my payroll,
and you do like you're told.

177
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,663
What the hell is that?

00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:14,570
Oh, it's like a '49 lndian, Pa.

Well, like l said,

182
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,312

00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:28,080

184
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,145
- You sure?
- Dead sure. Right, Petey?

185
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,453
Right. Absolutely, Dad.
No troubIe at all.

186
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,516
Don't even think about it.

187
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:38,722
Shit. Fucking dickwads!

188
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,992
Stupid sons of--

- Yes, sir.
- Then be here on time for once.

191
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:51,436
We been through this a dozen times,
and you're never fucking here.

192
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,478
Oh, shut up.

193
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,399
You're fading on me.

194
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:30,875
That's a good boy, Oki.
l could really use your help.

195
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:32,883
What do you say?

196
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:58,340
Man, you're a sick mother.

197
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,344
- Hey, what's the stink in here?
- SmelIs like death.

198
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,074
- Check your boots.
- lt ain't me.

199
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:06,276
- Smells like some damn manure in here.
- Maybe the outhouse fell over.

200
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,911
- Can l get you boys some coffee?
- Who you talking to?

201
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,683
- You, bitch.
- Better red than dead, asshole.

202
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,555
Fuck you! Your boss shorted us
15 gallons of ephedrine.

203
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:17,493
Why don't you boys
take your differences outside?

204
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:21,431
Well, you heard our town constable.
You gents best be moving along.

205
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,491
- Shut the fuck up!
- Shut the hell up, ass wipe!

206
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,503
- Get the fuck out of here.
- You want to fucking make me?

207
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,597
- No need to be rude.
- Get the fuck out of my way.

208
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,835
- Oh, shoot me.
- Get out of my way.

209
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,843
Say hey to your wife and my kids
for me.

210
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,277
Fuck you, fucker.

211
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,615
- What'll you have?
- Come on, Rhonda.

212
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,020
You know we like Dottie
to take our order.

213
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,617
Dottie the hottie. You got nice tits--
no offense--

214
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,628
but hers are bigger and firmer.

215
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,457
And people say you're
not sensitive, Jessie.

216
00:18:55,534 --> 00:19:00,233
Sure l am. Especially right around
the tip of my dick.

217
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,903
- Don't talk to Rhonda like that.
- You gonna stop him, Pop?

218
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,173
Hey, sweetheart,
did you maybe see something...

219
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,548
that could have upset you
or something?

220
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,452
No. I'm fine.

221
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,582
Really.
You sure about that?

222
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:24,560
- l'm fine.
- She won't even look me in the eye.

223
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,131
Johnny.

224
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,140
John--

225
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:42,814
- Sixtoes.
- Morning.

226
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,408
- Sixtoes.
- Morning.

227
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,145
How'd you find me?

228
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,455
l feel like a football.

229
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,092
I did a lot of stitching
on you, Eddie.

230
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,304
See you still like your tequila.

231
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,637
lf l stay drunk...

232
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,205
l won't kiIl anything.

233
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,217
Except the tequila.

234
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,653
You seem at peace.

235
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,663
l think I am.

236
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,433
Boy, but we had some wild times, huh?

237
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:41,495
All the broads and the booze.

238
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,064
Cigareets and whiskey

239
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,406
And wild, wild women

240
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,708
They'll drive you crazy

241
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,271
They'll drive you insane

242
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,580
Cigareets and whiskey

243
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:56,177
And wild, wild women

244
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,416
They'll drive you crazy

245
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,357
They'll drive you insane

246
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,361
Remember?

247
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,631
l remember.

248
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,960
l remember the killing too.

249
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:18,770
l remember that if it wasn't for you,
l wouldn't be here.

250
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,115
You know, my people say
that if you save a man's life...

251
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,783
your souls are locked together forever.

252
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,151
That's why l came to see you.

253
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:36,391
l wanted to get your okay...

254
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,726
to take a journey.

255
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,127
Well, l got things l gotta do then.

256
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:48,434
l have to look at the moon.

257
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:52,170
Talk to the smoke.
Listen to the wind.

258
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,714
Nothing's easy with an lndian.

259
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,672
They buzz me all the time.

260
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,265
There's an Air Force bombing range
right over those mountains.

261
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,004
Looks like F-15's today.

262
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:32,215
What are you gonna do
when you catch those three brothers?

263
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:36,277
- Get your gift back.
- You got me a gift and they took it?

264
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,353
Yeah.
They're gonna kill you.

265
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:45,726
And if the Hogans don't,
then the Heathens wilI.

266
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:47,560
Heathens?

267
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:50,294
They're in the dope business
with the Hogans.

268
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:54,030
Hey, what do you say we do
a little ''divide and conquer''?

269
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,040
Like we used to in the old days.

270
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:59,305
They're making life pretty miserable
for the good people around here.

271
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:09,943
Hear that coyote?
You and him are a lot alike.

272
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:14,549
Coyote's got courage, wisdom,
a sense of mischief.

273
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,992
And he's got a small dick,
just like you.

274
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,927
- I'm gonna take a piss.
- lt's windy up here.

275
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:29,564
This ain't windy.
lt's Oki.

276
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:32,633
He's glad you're feeIing better.

277
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:44,353
Good morning, Mr. Early.

278
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,256
Ah. Good morning, Rhonda.

279
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:51,091
What has got you up
at the crack of dawn?

280
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,859
Well, l had a dream last night.

281
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,424
Oh, a dream.
What was it about?

282
00:23:57,502 --> 00:24:00,699
Well, I dreamed that l heard the sound
of the coyote...

283
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:04,264
and that today was going
to be a glorious day.

284
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:07,402
- Oh, a glorious day, huh?
- Very glorious.

285
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,071
Well, I would Iike to hear
more about that.

286
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:10,910
Why don't you come in
and help me make the coffee.

287
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:14,782
That would be my pIeasure, my dear.
My pleasure.

288
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:24,757
My lucky hat, Eddie.

289
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,196
Thanks.

290
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:29,199
Here. You might need this.

291
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:31,201
I've got a gun...

292
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:34,033
and I'm going to get it back.

293
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:36,039
Which way is town?

294
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,575
Take the game trail
down to the road...

295
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,702
then head west.

296
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,940
Highway Patrol comes through
about once a week.

297
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,048
See you around, lndian.

298
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:51,088
l'm gonna get your gift back, then...

299
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,852
l want your okay
to take a journey.

300
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:02,928
Yo! When you get to town,
head straight for the diner.

301
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:06,402
Some of Rhonda's apple pie
will put a smile on your face.

302
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:02,122
My heavens! What was that?

303
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:05,822
Nothing to worry about, ma'am.
Just the flyboys showing off.

304
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:09,389
- You folks just passing through?
- Yeah. We're looking for some UFOs.

305
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:12,834
We got lost the minute we turned
off the interstate.

306
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,737
- Lost, huh?
- Well, not exactly lost.

307
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:17,900
Oh, Clarence, you've always been lost.

308
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:20,240
You got a map to the interstate?

309
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,576
Don't need no map, lvy.

310
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:25,775
- Well, we're fresh out.
- Choke and die, you old farts!

311
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,114
- What was that?
- Let's go, lvy.

312
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:30,313
- What'd he say?
- I don't know, lvy.

313
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,822
- Come back and see us, hear?
- Oh, you bet ya.

314
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,595
- I'm gonna head to the Pearly Gates.
- All right. l'll meet you there.

315
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:51,540
See you in a few.
Check up on that .45.

316
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,073
You two jackasses
ain't sold that gun yet?

317
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:58,081
Does it look sold to you?

318
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:00,913
Man, that's pitiful.

319
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:03,216
Come on, give me the envelope.
l ain't got all fucking day.

320
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:11,824
You inbreds. You're real good
at running credit card scams...

321
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:14,626
and ripping off oId folks
looking for space ships.

322
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,997
That's reaI cute, but if my father
has to come down here...

323
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:20,231
you two lowlifes are gonna pee
your Iittle SWAT team pants.

324
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,709
Isn't that right?

325
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:34,515
Thought so.

326
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,853
Oh, my God.

327
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:16,151
Rhonda, you remember
about the time l told you...

328
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:19,822
when me and Vern saw that guy
getting all beat up by the Hogans?

329
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,832
That's him.

330
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,836
- Dottie, l talk to you for a minute?
- Not--

331
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,701
l thought I told you
to keep your mouth shut.

332
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:29,740
Keep your mouth shut!

333
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:08,205
Hey! lf you're looking for UFOs,
take a fucking hike.

334
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:12,910
That guy on the bike--
who is he?

335
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,680
Hey, scumbag, you want information,
dial 411.

336
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,688
Now get the fuck out.

337
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:23,320
That .45--
where did you get it?

338
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,367
From your grandma.

339
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:35,672
Oh, yeah, my grandma.

340
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:41,807
Yeah, she's-- she's dead.

341
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,314
l've been taking shit all day.

342
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:56,454
Catch!

343
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:03,132
- That a gunshot, Pop?
- lt's probably Lester and Leon...

344
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:06,034
shooting ground squirrels
out in back.

345
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:09,767
There hasn't been any ground squirrels
around here since l was a baby.

346
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,138
I bet it's him.

347
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,820
Praise the Lord!

348
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:32,522
Praise His everlasting glory!

349
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:35,191
Save us, Jesus!

350
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:39,259
Save us--
Henry, what are you doing out there?

351
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:44,365
Not five minutes ago l saw a man
in a straw hat go into Eli's Emporium.

352
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,501
Then l just heard a gunshot.

353
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,637
- We'd better call the State Police.
- Why?

354
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:51,739
lt takes them an hour to get out here
even when they know where they're going.

355
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:55,479
What if the man in the straw hat
is a robber? A rapist?

356
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:58,044
What do we do if he comes in here?

357
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:01,557
We could rent him a room.

358
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:09,296
- Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
- Rent him a room?

359
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:21,967
If there's anybody
still alive out there...

360
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:25,743
l'd sure like you to get me out
of the stink back here.

361
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:37,492
Well, don't just stand there.
Get me out of here.

362
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,292
They keep the key
over the door jamb.

363
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,145
Well, that's better.

364
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:03,085
Now, let's get out of the stink.

365
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,760
My whole damn foot's asleep.

366
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:12,762
Follow me.

367
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:22,101
Where's the tank?
Bring my goddamn tank.

368
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,604
Well, get it out here.
l ain't gonna live forever.

369
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,718
You do Lester like this?

370
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,720
And Leon too?

371
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:43,950
You done them both--
both at the same time?

372
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:49,990
- They left me no choice.
- Well, that sounds like them.

373
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:53,367
Leon looks kind of peaceful,
don't he?

374
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:56,373
- Yeah.
- You got a name?

375
00:32:56,441 --> 00:33:00,673
- Eddie Lomax.
- Boys, meet Eddie Lomax.

376
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:04,647
- Eddie Lomax, meet the boys.
- Hi, boys.

377
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,589
Oh, that feels good.

378
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,288
My name's Eli Hamilton.

379
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:21,924
About two months ago,
when I took ilI...

380
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,370
Lester and Leon come down here
supposedly to help me run the store.

381
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:30,771
The bastards.
Run the store, hell!

382
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,776
They took over.

383
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,571
Well, don't just sit there.
Bring me the tank.

384
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:39,707
They chained me
to that chair back there.

385
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:44,778
Told everybody l was in the hospital.
No visitors allowed.

386
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:07,567
They starved me
and then they beat me.

387
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:13,843
And they was my nephews.
lmagine that!

388
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,287
They hoped l'd die, but I didn't.

389
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,984
And then you come along
and killed them.

390
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:30,628
l know where they hid their money.

391
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,635
Here.

392
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:40,210
- You can have it all.
- Don't want your money.

393
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:41,973
Well, then, take a truck.
Make a run for it.

394
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:46,244
- No. l've got some unfinished business.
- What business?

395
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,615
- You know the Hogans?
- Oh, you gonna kiIl them too?

396
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:51,780
My advice is go ahead and kill them.

397
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:55,383
Yeah. Wipe out the whole
poisonous nest.

398
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,826
- All of them?
- AbsoIutely.

399
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,695
But what about them?
My kin folk?

400
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,067
My mess.
l'll take care of it.

401
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:11,233
Where you going now?

402
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:14,107
- Get a bite to eat.
- Straight ahead.

403
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:17,579
And Rhonda's apple pie is famous
in these here parts.

404
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:20,776
- Thanks.
- Oh, no. Thank you.

405
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:25,983
- He's still alive.
- I figured he would be.

406
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:28,025
Trouble on the hoof,
and it's coming this way.

407
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:30,026
Shut up, Vern.

408
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,645
So, just passing through?

409
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,142
You're just passing through?

410
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:02,351
- More or less.
- Sure is hot today.

411
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,930
What'll you have?

412
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:19,068
l would like a piece
of your famous apple pie.

413
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:24,138
Famous?
And how would you know?

414
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:28,811
Eli just told me. And Johnny said
it would put a smile on my face.

415
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:30,820
Johnny?

416
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,254
- Johnny who?
- Sixtoes.

417
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,717
How do you know Johnny Sixtoes?

418
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:38,853
We go way back.

419
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,195
- Really?
- Yeah.

420
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:47,866
Way back.
How about you?

421
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:53,241
l was ten,
and l got bit by a rattler...

422
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:56,303
on my ankle-- here.

423
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,380
See?

424
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:04,318
Johnny saved my life
and we've been friends ever since.

425
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,323
Johnny was right.

426
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,325
About what?

427
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:15,731
It's a good pie.

428
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,202
Thank you.

429
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:23,829
You know Lester and Leon?

430
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,570
- Not anymore.
- Oh.

431
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:37,282
- So, uh, what brings you to town?
- l'm looking for the Hogans.

432
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,289
- You just missed Jessie.
- Dottie!

433
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:43,726
- You got business with the Hogans?
- They've got something of Johnny's...

434
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:46,820
- and l'm gonna get it back.
- Yeah, right.

435
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:53,961
Well, maybe I could help.

436
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:55,972
Eddie Lomax.

437
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:00,169
Rhonda Lomax--
Uh, Reynolds.

438
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:06,515
Rhonda Reynolds.
And my granddad, Billing Reynolds.

439
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,552
Oh. Sorry. Pie.

440
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:13,618
- Just call me Pop.
- Hi, Pop.

441
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:22,730
Excuse me. l don't mean to be intrusive,
but l'm curious.

442
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,268
Did my Bertie send you?

443
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:31,174
Bertie did send you, didn't she?

444
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,642
She said she was going to get me
a good job...

445
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:37,147
because l'm such a wonderful handyman.

446
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:40,683
A handyman?

447
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:45,585
- l can use a handyman.
- Well, then, l'm your handyman.

448
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,785
Yeah.

449
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:55,121
Oh, no. No.
lt's on the house.

450
00:38:56,901 --> 00:39:00,302
- You're very kind.
- My pleasure.

451
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:03,667
- Let's go, handyman.
- Right-o.

452
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:21,983
See? l told you, Rhonda. lt's gonna be
a gIorious day today. Glorious.

453
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,494
HoId on there.
Hold on.

454
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,827
Gotta fix that door.

455
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:32,392
Hold on there.
My name is Jubal. Jubal Early.

456
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:37,438
- Hi, Jubal. Good to meet you.
- Thank you. And you are?

457
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:41,968
- Eddie Lomax.
- Eddie Lomax. l like that.

458
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,573
Nice to meet you, Eddie.
This your first time though here?

459
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:49,585
- Yes. First time.
- l hope you have a great stay.

460
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,986
HelIo.

461
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,757
What do we have here?

462
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,094
Leon?

463
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:05,602
And Lester?
Did you kill them?

464
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:08,638
Not my business, not my business.

465
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:11,903
As far as l'm concerned,
l won't miss them one iota.

466
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:14,240
Had a beautiful dog once.

467
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:18,441
They shot him dead, and never said
one word about it. Not one word.

468
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:26,954
- Always wanted to do that.
- Oh, you're back Eddie. Good.

469
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:30,425
Hi, Jubal.
l see you've met Eddie Lomax.

470
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,428
Yes, l have.

471
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:35,329
So, Eli, how are you?
l've not seen you in quite a spell.

472
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:39,665
- Quite a spell.
- Yeah, well, l've been tied up.

473
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:43,002
So, Mr. Lomax, what is the job?

474
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:48,234
- Lose the bodies.
- Privacy. That's me motto.

475
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:50,507
No job too big or too small.

476
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,640
l'll tend to it straight away, sir.

477
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,852
Gadzooks!

478
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,514
BIoody well bled all over back here.

479
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:01,080
He bloody well bled all over.

480
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:02,989
However, not to worry.

481
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,255
Some Spic and Span,
a little elbow grease...

482
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:08,696
several yards of Saran Wrap,
and everything will be as good as new.

483
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,927
Good as new.

484
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:14,630
Well, gents, if you'll excuse me,
l'll go fetch me truck.

485
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,945
I won't be long.
Won't be long.

486
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,016
Why does he always repeat himself?

487
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:30,110
l don't know.
l don't know.

488
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:41,790
Those damn hooligans.
Now what are they up to?

489
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:45,632
- The Heathens?
- Yeah. Mangy pieces of shit.

490
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:50,207
Hey, I've got something better
than a .45.

491
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,208
Follow me.

492
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:58,548
Bring my goddamn tank!

493
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,368
l knew you couId do it.

494
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,641
My nephews, them spawns of hell...

495
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,644
they ripped off some of this stuff
from an army depot.

496
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,771
You know how to use them?

497
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,451
Well, l guess you do.

498
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,987
Help yourself.

499
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,989
l just need this for now.

500
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,353
You're very kind.
Thank you.

501
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:46,919
- l owe you a debt of gratitude.
- My pleasure.

502
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:50,592
What are you gonna do now?

503
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:52,602
Take a shower.

504
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:57,271
Good idea.

505
00:42:57,341 --> 00:43:00,640
Bungalow five.
Made up fresh this morning.

506
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,946
Thank you both.

507
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:08,379
Young man? Have you been saved?

508
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:12,178
l'm afraid l'm a bad boy, ma'am.

509
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,656
But it's never too late.

510
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:22,291
l hope you're right.

511
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,702
Oh, ma'am.

512
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:32,469
- l Iove your hair.
- Why, thank you.

513
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:42,911
- Henry, l don't think he's a rapist.
- How would you know?

514
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,653
Night-night, fellas.

515
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,124
Hey, what do you say
we do a little ''divide and conquer''...

516
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:27,129
like in the old days?

517
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,139
- Good evening, Eddie.
- Evening, Eddie.

518
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:38,140
Good evening, boys.

519
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:42,075
You sure smell a lot better.

520
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:44,080
Thank you, Eli.

521
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:47,481
Tell me. The Heathens--
where do they hang out?

522
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:51,146
You got a plan, huh?
Not that you need to tell me what it is.

523
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:55,248
There's a roadhouse about 15 miIes
down the highway--

524
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:57,259
the Bomb Bay Cafe.

525
00:44:57,327 --> 00:45:01,286
Run by a talI, dark fella
by the name of Singh.

526
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,926
But fair warning.
lt can get pretty rough in there.

527
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:06,936
Yeah, it can get very rough
in there, Eddie.

528
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:09,097
But that doesn't worry you,
does it?

529
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:12,540
You'lI need some wheels.
Take that Dodge pickup there.

530
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:14,543
Here. Help yourself.

531
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:18,739
Thank you.

532
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,455
You know, l bet he gets
Iots of pussy.

533
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:28,457
Yeah. l bet.

534
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:52,277
No! No, no, no, no!

535
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,442
No more dancing.
l don't want to dance anymore.

536
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:56,452
- Get out!
- Where the hell you going?

537
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,954
- l can't dance aIl by myself.
- You promised...

538
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:01,047
to take us to the bus depot.

539
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,753
- We want to go home!
- One more dance, please?

540
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:07,729
No more dancing. l want to go home.
l'm not putting--

541
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:11,131
You'll go when l goddamn tell you to go!
Now you dance!

542
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:19,542
No more shooting!
Please, l beg you, pIease!

543
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,511
l teIl you what.
The next round is on the house.

544
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:25,343
- Yeah !
- The next round is in your foot!

545
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:27,076
Now, dance!

546
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:36,188
Hey!
Can't we aIl just get along?

547
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:47,464
- l don't want to get along.
- Ah.

548
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:50,405
Hey, Jack. Your girls here
seem to have a thing...

549
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,999
for this sissy in his sissy hat.

550
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:56,379
What are you looking at?
l own your ass.

551
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:00,542
Hey!
You're a very naughty boy.

552
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:06,383
You're one smart motherfucker,
ain't you?

553
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:08,686
- Thank you.
- Make him dead.

554
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:22,638
Who's next?

555
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:25,004
Drop your guns.

556
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:27,168
Please.

557
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:34,379
Hey, mister,
take us with you.

558
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:44,993
- Okay. Pick up the guns.
- God! Oh, my God!

559
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:50,728
You have just dispatched three
of my best customers. l am a ruined man!

560
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:54,202
Prithee, sir, who is going to pay
for all this damage?

561
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:57,866
- My new boss.
- And who might that person be?

562
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:00,842
- The Hogans.
- Son of a bitch.

563
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:02,538
All of you, inside.

564
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:10,084
Thank you.
Hey girls, did l look tough enough?

565
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:12,087
Yeah. Real tough.

566
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:14,089
You took a big chance for us, mister.

567
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:18,253
Oh, no. I have my own reasons, and they
have nothing to do with you two.

568
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:21,229
Put your guns in the back
and jump in.

569
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:47,220
Maybe he's some kind of gunfighter
or bounty hunter or something, you know?

570
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:50,021
Whoever he is,
he sure finished off that pig Spider.

571
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,890
l mean, he just kiIled him
Iike a bug.

572
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:56,524
Yeah, but Eddie's got
those gentle eyes, you know?

573
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,433
Yeah. He sure does.

574
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:03,305
l wonder if he's circumcised.

575
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:08,835
Henry?
Henry, you should be in bed.

576
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:11,574
Marge. Marge.

577
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:14,446
Good Lord.
I can't help wondering...

578
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:17,578
about those two poor, innocent girls.

579
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:19,884
- What's he gonna do to them?
- l don't know, dear.

580
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,949
But l have to go to the store.
We're out of Depends.

581
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:26,587
And you should be asleep.
Take your pills.

582
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:30,030
You're right.
You're always right.

583
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:42,735
Eddie.
lt's Carol, from next door.

584
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:47,715
What do you want?

585
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:49,809
I want to thank you.

586
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:52,821
You're welcome.

587
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:56,256
No, l really want to thank you.

588
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:13,038
Hi.

589
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:16,841
- Hi.
- May l come in?

590
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:18,847
Sure.

591
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:43,234
Thank you.

592
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,678
You're welcome.

593
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,318
Oh, when the saints

594
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,322
Go marching in

595
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:04,850
Oh, when the saints go marching in

596
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:09,365
Oh, Lord, l want
to be in that number

597
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:13,597
Oh, when the saints
go marching in

598
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:46,701
- Eddie, it's Rose.
- What do you want?

599
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:50,570
l just want to say thank you.
I didn't know you were busy.

600
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,665
Hey, you're next.

601
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:55,677
- Really?
- Praise the Lord.

602
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,014
The door.

603
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:03,786
He's spreading joy to everyone.

604
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:15,425
Wait. Eddie, where are you going?

605
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:17,433
l'm gonna go check on my bike.

606
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:22,370
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

607
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,238
Where is he going?

608
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,800
For a bike ride.

609
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:31,939
Where does he get the energy?

610
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,463
Sweet dreams.

611
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:13,518
You're up early, Eddie.

612
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:16,525
- Sorry l woke you.
- Aw, forget it.

613
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:18,925
At my age
you don't sleep much anyway.

614
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:22,658
- Do you mind?
- Help yourseIf.

615
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:25,929
Okay. Oh, listen.

616
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:28,436
Send Jubal to the Bomb Bay Cafe.

617
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:31,303
He'll know what to do--
cIean-up job.

618
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,138
And l've got two girls
in my bungalow.

619
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,441
Put them on the bus to Cleveland.

620
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:38,981
Two girls. Yeah, sure.

621
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,880
l can take care of both of them.

622
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:45,445
How many of them Heathens
did you get down at the Bomb Bay?

623
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:48,958
- Just three.
- Not bad. Not bad.

624
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:53,860
And are you going after the Hogans?

625
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:05,969
Cowards!
Why the fuck didn't you kill him?

626
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:09,534
- He was outgunned and outnumbered!
- Fuck you, Ives. You weren't there.

627
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:11,945
Who the fuck you talking to, fool?

628
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:14,984
l'll screw this up your ass and splatter
your brains all over the desert.

629
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:17,485
- Do you understand?
- Back the fuck off.

630
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:19,613
lf you had any balls,
you'd take him yourself.

631
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:21,987
You keep talking like that, lrma...

632
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:25,585
you're gonna look funny
sucking my dick with no teeth.

633
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:28,392
We've tried to live in peace
with the Hogans.

634
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:31,525
Ramsey's broken the truce...

635
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,694
by hiring this gunman.

636
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:37,433
- So let's blow up his lab.
- We ain't gonna blow up his lab...

637
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:42,209
'cause we're gonna need it,
brothers and sisters.

638
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,213
We're gonna need it...

639
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:48,445
'cause we're gonna take over
his entire operation.

640
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:50,452
Everything!

641
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,647
Cut off the head of the snake...

642
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,781
the body dies.

643
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:58,692
Let's kill Ramsey.
What do you say? Come on!

644
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:01,128
Hold it!

645
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:03,188
Ramsey's not even in town.

646
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:05,700
- How do you know that?
- 'Cause l know my enemies.

647
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:10,001
First Thursday every month,
the fat pig goes up to Vegas...

648
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:12,473
with his bastard sons.

649
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:14,874
He sees his stockbroker...

650
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:17,412
then over to his hooker
to get his knob waxed.

651
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,584
He usually gets back
between 12:00 and 1:00.

652
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:27,449
We'll be waiting for him!

653
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:44,737
Can l ask you a question?

654
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:47,299
What's the matter now?
You gotta go pee-pee?

655
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:52,639
No, sir. lt's just that, well--

656
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:54,775
Spit it out, weenie boy.

657
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:02,380
l was just wonderin', why are you ridin'
me and Jesse so much and never Petey?

658
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:05,519
- He rides me plenty.
- He does not.

659
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:07,859
- Shut up!
- Yeah, alI right.

660
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:09,865
l love Petey
'cause I loved his mother.

661
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:12,766
She died giving him birth.

662
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:16,237
- He's our love chiId.
- Oh, my God.

663
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:20,676
What about me and Jess?

664
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:22,803
You two are
the unfortunate results...

665
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,473
of some recreational fucking
back when fucking was fun.

666
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,489
Geez.

667
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:37,583
Get over it.

668
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,855
We got company.

669
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:42,420
And they're closing fast.

670
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:47,565
Heathens.
They got us outgunned!

671
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:49,571
As soon as we round the bend, jump!

672
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,253
I'm a chemist.
l'm not a doctor.

673
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:41,017
lt looks like he may have a concussion
and possibly some internal injuries.

674
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:44,025
- He should be in a hospital.
- Okay, Chang, go back to work.

675
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:46,584
- He's your son.
- You're goddamn right he is!

676
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:48,961
- You sure you're okay, boy?
- Yeah, Dad, just a headache.

677
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:52,365
l'm gonna get some real firepower.

678
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:57,202
Wait a minute. Daddy! Think about it.
Why would they attack us?

679
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:59,537
We're in business together.
lt don't make no sense.

680
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:02,510
A man shoots at me and mine,
l shoot back and ask questions later.

681
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:06,572
l'm paying 500 bucks a head, and that
weaselly little rat-fuck lves is mine!

682
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:09,948
- l want you to stay in and rest.
- l'll rest when l'm dead, Daddy.

683
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:12,180
Hell, they tried to kill me too.

684
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:17,688
WelI, ain't you a block
off the old chip.

685
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,853
We're going pig hunting tonight.

686
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:42,574
Sixtoes?

687
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:46,144
Always forget how easy it is
to sneak up on a white man.

688
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:48,782
I've been thinking
about your problem.

689
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:51,349
You been wanting to die
for how Iong now?

690
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:53,588
A year? You're not dead yet?

691
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:58,091
lt's easy to come up with 100 reasons
to take the journey...

692
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:00,465
but you only need one
to go on living.

693
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,901
l don't have one.

694
00:59:05,975 --> 00:59:08,341
WeIl, what about Rhonda?
She's a nice girl.

695
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:11,539
Ought to marry her,
have some kids.

696
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:17,042
Hey, there's something
moving down there.

697
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,611
Looks Iike a bunch of white guys
with bushes on their heads.

698
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,218
Old ''divide and conquer'' working, huh?

699
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:32,626
Should we even the odds?

700
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:53,012
Bastards!

701
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,580
- Thought we got rid of you!
- Think again!

702
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,754
Answer me one thing!

703
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:01,922
- How come you tried to kill us tonight?
- Stop firing!

704
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:05,430
Stop firing!

705
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:08,095
- Forgot, huh?
- Forgot what?

706
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:10,401
Your hired gun
wasted three of mine!

707
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:13,169
At the Bomb Bay!
l don't take that laying down !

708
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:16,678
- What hired gun?
- Ramsey, you piece of shit.

709
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:19,544
You know.
Your man with the Colt .45.

710
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,176
Matt, that's the guy
from the dry lake.

711
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:23,775
lt's gotta be!

712
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:27,414
- You toId me you killed him.
- l did!

713
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,788
- What the hell is he talking about?
- Stop firing!

714
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:32,453
The guy with the motorcycle.

715
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:34,223
Motorcycle?

716
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:37,289
- lt ain't my fault!
- You told me it would be no trouble!

717
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:40,803
lt ain't my fault! Petey was supposed
to cap him. He told me he would.

718
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:43,202
There you go, screwing up again!

719
01:00:43,272 --> 01:00:45,672
- You just keep screwing up!
- Lay off me, man !

720
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:50,406
- When are you gonna learn, weenie boy?
- Get off me, old man !

721
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:09,354
l said it wasn't me!
I didn't do it!

722
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:18,238
- Think you're tough enough?
- Yes, l do!

723
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:29,876
You killed him.

724
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:36,291
You killed him, Matt.
You killed him!

725
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:39,624
You killed him, Peter,
'cause you didn't shoot that guy...

726
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,755
like you said you did!

727
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:46,598
You lied to me, boy.
And that's why Gunney's dead!

728
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:49,331
You're one of us!
You're family!

729
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:52,431
l'm glad l ran away from home
when l was a kid.

730
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:54,339
You understand?

731
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:57,641
lt's getting a little too cozy
down there, don't you think?

732
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,648
- You Iike barbecue?
- I love it.

733
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,479
l'm sorry, man!

734
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,883
l told you we didn't hire
no gunman !

735
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:10,983
Up in the tower!
It's the guy from the Bomb Bay!

736
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:15,224
l'll get the cable.
Get their attention. Then you beat it.

737
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:18,199
lt's a good plan,
but one thing's wrong.

738
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,828
There he is!

739
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:26,673
He's going up the side!

740
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:47,018
Get him!
Get that bastard!

741
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:55,370
That ain't him!

742
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:59,105
Where did you get the hat?

743
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:03,703
- Do you Iike it?
- You damn smart-ass!

744
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,682
l guess it's my hat now.
You like it? Damn it!

745
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:11,345
Wait, wait, wait. Maybe it's that
spooky lndian we always heard about.

746
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:14,412
No, he never was for real.

747
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:17,357
The guy with the Colt .45, you don't
know nothing about him neither?

748
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:22,087
- Who is he, Chief?
- Tell me!

749
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:24,929
- He's a coyote.
- Coyote my ass!

750
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:28,596
- String him up.
- Somebody get me a rope, huh?

751
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:33,472
Coyote my ass. Coyote man!
Where you at? You hear me, boy?

752
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:37,274
Stick around, we'll have
a little fun with your friend here.

753
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:39,280
A little puppet show!

754
01:03:51,761 --> 01:03:53,729
How many cowboys does it take
to find a stray dog?

755
01:03:53,796 --> 01:03:55,320
Eddie!

756
01:03:57,633 --> 01:03:59,726
Shut up!
He's over there!

757
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:31,864
This journey ain't over
for you or for her!

758
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,982
Stand him up!

759
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:58,955
Say sayonara to your lndian friend!

760
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:01,657
There he is! Get him!

761
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:07,127
Name your first kid after me!

762
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:21,406
You rejects can't do nothing right!

763
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,889
Home, sweet home.

764
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:23,940
Cigareets and whiskey

765
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:26,481
And wild, wild women

766
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:29,347
They'll drive you crazy

767
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:31,818
They'll drive you insane

768
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,351
ls everything alI right, Mr. Early?

769
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:07,651
No, Rhonda, I'm quite upset.

770
01:07:07,723 --> 01:07:10,214
Oh, well, what's the matter?

771
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:15,491
l had a dream again last night,
and it was quite troubling.

772
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:17,828
l heard the howl of the coyote...

773
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:23,770
but this time there was violence
and blood and death.

774
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:27,366
But that was just a bad dream.
That's nothing to worry about.

775
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:40,619
Gather around, now.
We all hanged that lndian!

776
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:44,318
And l'm offering a $10,000 reward for
anybody that gets me that Eddie Coyote!

777
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:48,022
Dead or alive.
You understand?

778
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:49,496
Now, Beserko, you go take--

779
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:52,932
- l gotta go.
- Good luck, my dear.

780
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:55,869
Petey, come with me.
We're gonna check out Pearly Gates.

781
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:28,804
Sixtoes, is he okay?

782
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:33,437
He's gone.

783
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:59,898
You gotta listen to me.
They're looking aIl over for you.

784
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:03,370
You got a $10,000 reward
on your head.

785
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,373
It's okay.

786
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:53,512
- l'm going back to town.
- l'm gonna go with you.

787
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:57,849
Forget it.

788
01:09:57,927 --> 01:10:01,522
Johnny was my friend too.

789
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:42,682
You all hold up.

790
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:44,851
- Hey, we're closed!
- ReIax, Pop.

791
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:46,485
Can't you read?

792
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:48,530
- You're on deck!
- Just shut up!

793
01:12:48,597 --> 01:12:50,531
Shut the hell up!

794
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:53,295
- l'm not gonna thank you for shit!
- Shut up!

795
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,996
l'm telling you, we are not--

796
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:58,039
Shut your pie hole!

797
01:12:58,107 --> 01:13:01,099
- l get a share of the reward, right?
- Sure you do.

798
01:13:01,176 --> 01:13:03,041
Just show us where he is.

799
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:05,876
- Oh, Vern--
- lt's all right, Pop.

800
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:09,008
He's at the motel.
Right there, the blue one.

801
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:11,348
Let's go see if he needs
room service.

802
01:13:16,191 --> 01:13:18,989
Let me go!

803
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:21,552
Leave her alone!

804
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:24,531
- You can't do that!
- l just did!

805
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,625
Come on !

806
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:29,899
- You want to dance?
- Yeah!

807
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:32,668
Your dancing days are over,
old man!

808
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:34,208
l'm sorry, Pop!

809
01:13:40,382 --> 01:13:43,215
Stick around, Dottie.
You and me got a date.

810
01:13:48,123 --> 01:13:50,421
- Why'd you shoot Pop?
- Put a lid on it!

811
01:13:50,492 --> 01:13:54,360
You want your reward?
Shut the fuck up!

812
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,661
He's in bungalow three. The third one
in the middle. The bIue one.

813
01:13:57,733 --> 01:14:00,099
Remember,
he's a damn cold-blooded killer.

814
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:02,535
All right?
Joe Bob, head over to Eli's.

815
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:04,663
Quick, let's get some ammo!

816
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:14,515
- How's this?
- No, that's a .38.

817
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:16,778
- There.
- No, that's a .45.

818
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:20,117
- And this?
- No, that is a suppository!

819
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:23,784
Get your frickin' hands up
wh-wh-where l can see them!

820
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:28,925
What the hell was that?

821
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:37,430
l gotta talk to you.

822
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:42,102
This is getting way out of control !
Someone could get hurt, even kilIed.

823
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:45,772
Sounds Iike it should mean
something to me, but it just don't.

824
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:48,078
That's it! l quit!
Get off me!

825
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:51,586
l ain't crossin' this line untiI
l get a piece of that ten grand.

826
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:54,816
Jess, go turn that chicken-ass tenor
into a soprano for me.

827
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:56,687
- Back off, Petey.
- Jessie, it's me.

828
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:59,226
We went to high school together.
l signed your yearbook.

829
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:02,491
- l thought l recognized you.
- Okay, l'm coming.

830
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:09,063
That wasn't funny!

831
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,001
Good Lord!

832
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:18,069
Why, you cleaved him open
from collarbone to belly button.

833
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:20,740
You don't see that every day.

834
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:41,536
You got back doors
to these shacks?

835
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:46,107
- No, just windows.
- All right, we'll cover them.

836
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:48,233
- All right, then.
- Come on. Let's go!

837
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:50,301
Let's get this coyote man.

838
01:15:59,021 --> 01:16:01,319
Mine eyes have seen the glory

839
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:04,723
- Patience, Elijah.
- Of the coming of the Lord

840
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,509
Hey, mister!
They got the place surrounded!

841
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:23,738
Give yourself up!
They're serious about this!

842
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:25,837
- Get the hell out of there, Vern!
- Come on out!

843
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:29,145
- Get out of the way, punk!
- They'll kill you if you don't!

844
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:50,498
My God!

845
01:16:50,572 --> 01:16:52,665
Nobody could live through that,
right? He'd dead.

846
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:56,802
- That's right. Now, go check it out.
- Yeah, right!

847
01:16:56,878 --> 01:17:00,075
- You go in there and make for sure.
- But he's dead!

848
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:02,616
- He's dead.
- Get your ass in there.

849
01:17:02,684 --> 01:17:04,117
He's dead!

850
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:07,053
Stick your head in the door!

851
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:09,920
Make sure he is!

852
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:13,118
Go on!

853
01:17:14,896 --> 01:17:17,558
Mister, are you there?

854
01:17:22,437 --> 01:17:25,736
There's nobody in there.
It's empty and it's full of holes.

855
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:28,776
lrma, go check it out.

856
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:31,779
Buck, go with her.
We got your back.

857
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:39,453
lt's a booby trap
that didn't go off.

858
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:42,285
Circle around, men.
We gotta find him.

859
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:44,723
We can't let him get away!
Y'aIl see anything?

860
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:47,660
- No, Matt, nothing.
- Y'all search over here?

861
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:58,934
What in the hell
are you doing over here, boy?

862
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:01,305
- Backing you up.
- Backing me up.

863
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:02,900
Yeah.

864
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:10,542
You didn't even fire
one damn shot, did you?

865
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:12,246
Did you?

866
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:20,919
Man, that's just weak, man.

867
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:22,588
Real weak.

868
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:29,164
Shit! Can't even count
on your own blood.

869
01:18:33,408 --> 01:18:33,442
Quit your fussin' over that booby trap.
Let's get out of here!

870
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:36,605
Quit your fussin' over that booby trap.
Let's get out of here!

871
01:18:36,678 --> 01:18:39,704
- I got me a new shotgun.
- No, you didn't. l saw it first.

872
01:18:39,781 --> 01:18:42,477
Buck, lrma,
help us find the coyote!

873
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,644
- lt's caught on something.
- Yeah, your greedy hand.

874
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,984
No, it's not.
I feel something over here.

875
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:57,621
- You okay?
- EIi was right.

876
01:18:57,699 --> 01:19:01,635
- You get good mileage to a full tank.
- You did a good job.

877
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:06,405
Go check on Pop, huh?

878
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:09,410
- Be careful.
- Go get him then, big King Kong!

879
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:13,312
- Take your ten grand and shove it!
- Petey, you alI right?

880
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:15,349
- Beserko! Shark!
- Jess, you okay?

881
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:18,614
No, l'm pissed off!
Now what?

882
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:21,247
Y'aIl head over to Eli's,
check on Joe Bob.

883
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:25,089
This is your last chance to be a man.
Are we straight?

884
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:26,855
- Yeah.
- You sure?

885
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:28,759
I'm gonna check out
that gas station.

886
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:31,492
l won't let you down, okay?

887
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:37,603
l'm gonna kill him!
Come on, you son of a bitch !

888
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:57,558
All right, Mother Theresa,
where is he?

889
01:19:57,626 --> 01:20:00,459
Repent! Repent, you sinner!

890
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:02,554
Take him, Lord!
Take him now!

891
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:05,930
- What's going on?
- The Lord's will.

892
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:08,128
- Get it off me!
- Again?

893
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:21,982
You got a coyote, huh?

894
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:23,642
Right hat.

895
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:26,879
Wrong guy.

896
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,905
What the hell is this?

897
01:20:46,975 --> 01:20:50,911
You know what the Bible says:
''Live by the sword, die by the sword.''

898
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:54,506
That's funny.
Where's the dude with the .45?

899
01:20:56,251 --> 01:20:59,414
Don't you joke with me, little chink!
l am not joking with you !

900
01:20:59,487 --> 01:21:02,047
- l'm gonna ask you one more time!
- He ain't gonna know where is.

901
01:21:02,123 --> 01:21:04,921
- Let's go find him, bro.
- You are not my brother!

902
01:21:04,993 --> 01:21:07,587
You are a liar and a coward...

903
01:21:07,662 --> 01:21:10,495
and you do not tell me
what to do!

904
01:21:10,565 --> 01:21:13,295
We would not be in this mess
if you had just shot that guy...

905
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:15,427
when you had the chance,
you Iittle coward!

906
01:21:15,503 --> 01:21:17,698
Now's your chance.

907
01:21:25,647 --> 01:21:28,878
He's a Iong bugger, this one.
We'll need another one of these.

908
01:21:37,192 --> 01:21:40,025
Get out of here.

909
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:10,057
You should've killed him...

910
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:12,320
'cause l'm gonna kiIl him
as soon as l'm done kiIlin' your ass.

911
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:15,090
Now, drop it. Drop it!

912
01:22:16,898 --> 01:22:19,924
Now, turn around,
nice and slow, like.

913
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:31,172
What's the matter?
That hurt?

914
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:33,339
Where are all
your Iittle friends now?

915
01:22:33,415 --> 01:22:36,782
This is what happens
when you mess with my town !

916
01:22:41,856 --> 01:22:46,122
Last chance to see the coyote!
l said get up, boy!

917
01:22:46,194 --> 01:22:48,355
Get up! Get up!

918
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:51,365
Stand up, little one!

919
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:54,101
You're pissing me off, you mutt!

920
01:22:55,203 --> 01:22:58,570
Come here, baby.
Say adios, baby.

921
01:22:59,774 --> 01:23:01,366
Checkout time.

922
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:06,574
Come on. Get up. Need a little hand?
You need a hand?

923
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:09,617
You've been causing too much hell
around my town!

924
01:23:09,684 --> 01:23:13,780
Stand up!
l don't want to kill you laying down.

925
01:23:13,855 --> 01:23:16,050
Come on !

926
01:23:17,025 --> 01:23:18,617
Teach you a damn lesson.

927
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:23,755
You gonna pay for what
you done to my family.

928
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:27,097
Knock it off, old man!

929
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:29,432
Everybody see this?

930
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:31,406
ls everybody watching?
lt's a beautiful day to die.

931
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:32,930
ls everybody watching?
lt's a beautiful day to die.

932
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:10,233
l got the bastard!

933
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:11,932
You? No!

934
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:13,940
lt was me.

935
01:25:14,008 --> 01:25:18,843
Army didn't give me a sharpshooter
medal for nothing, you know.

936
01:25:18,913 --> 01:25:21,575
What the hell you talkin' about?
You're all blind!

937
01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:23,913
- l got him!
- l love you.

938
01:25:24,986 --> 01:25:26,578
l love you.

939
01:25:30,758 --> 01:25:34,057
lt has never missed a shot!
Never missed a shot!

940
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:39,294
I beg your pardon, but my grandfather
was close to Rudyard Kipling...

941
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:41,392
another excellent marksman.

942
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:44,063
They were very close, like this.

943
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:46,300
You didn't even have
a bullet in your gun.

944
01:25:46,374 --> 01:25:50,208
- Oh, prithee, sir. What was in my gun?
- A suppository!

945
01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:23,777
- Cream, no sugar.
- This is a gold mine.

946
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:26,746
They're gonna start running busses here
every two hours.

947
01:26:26,814 --> 01:26:28,941
I know. It's a Iifesaver for us too.

948
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:31,747
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, ma'am.

949
01:26:33,821 --> 01:26:38,190
I don't want to be forward,
but do you like Samurai movies?

950
01:26:38,259 --> 01:26:40,489
l don't know.
l've never been to one.

951
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:44,498
Well, they're like Westerns,
only Japanese.

952
01:26:45,366 --> 01:26:48,631
Anyway, there's a special showing
on in Sun City...

953
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:50,637
one of my favorites,
calIed Yojimbo.

954
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:54,937
l'd sure love it if you'd
see it with me on Friday night.

955
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:57,534
Well, that sounds real nice, Buddy.

956
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:02,675
l could just drive down.
What time should l meet you?

957
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:05,844
Oh, no, no. l'll come pick you up.
Say around 5:00?

958
01:27:06,788 --> 01:27:09,985
- l'll be ready.
- Great.

959
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:12,583
My God, that must be Bertie.

960
01:27:17,365 --> 01:27:20,562
- King me, sir, please.
- AIl right.

961
01:27:20,635 --> 01:27:23,604
Very lucky day for you,
Mr. Singh.

962
01:27:23,671 --> 01:27:27,129
And a very lucky day, indeed,
for us all. Very lucky.

963
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:30,609
Our town is experiencing
a genuine renaissance...

964
01:27:30,678 --> 01:27:33,408
and we owe it all to Eddie.

965
01:27:33,481 --> 01:27:36,973
A hell of an idea of his,
telIing the tabloids...

966
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:40,214
about all the alien activity
around here.

967
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:44,520
Whoever knew there were so many
nuts in the world with money.

968
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:49,293
- That's a good one.
- l made you boys some brownies.

969
01:27:49,364 --> 01:27:51,457
Thank you very much.

970
01:27:51,532 --> 01:27:54,831
- Now, Bertie, you must sit and rest.
- Thank you.

971
01:27:54,902 --> 01:27:59,066
- And Eli, you must stop smoking.
- Why?

972
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:03,406
Because my Bertie and l
are having a baby.

973
01:28:04,812 --> 01:28:06,905
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

974
01:28:06,981 --> 01:28:08,915
Congratulations, my friend.

975
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:22,225
Hey, look who's here!

976
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:29,966
You see hi m too?
I do now.
