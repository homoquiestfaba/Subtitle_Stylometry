1
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:27,118
- So, how do you like this rain, Danny?
- I'm sick of it, Jim.

2
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:30,788
Well, it seems Mr. Sunshine should be
peeking through those early morning clouds.

3
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:33,365
- Yeah, promises, promises.
- Folks, tell you what.

4
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:36,663
We have a question for you, and
the first caller with the right answer wins...

00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,864
An orthopedic tractor seat cushion

6
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:43,340
- Okay, he was a recent two-term president.
- Of the Moose Lodge?

7
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,343
No, no, little buddy.

8
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:49,049
The ex-president of the United States
and, many say, the most popular in history.

9
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:51,647
The first president
to be divorced in office.

10
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:54,379
- And he's moving right here to...
- Mooseport.!

11
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,614
- Okay, we got a caller here.

12
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,089
- Judy Dunkle, can you name him?
- Would that be Eagle Cole?

13
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,285
- Monroe "Eagle" Cole.!

14
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,294
Hey, congratulations.!
You're a winner, Judy.!

15
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,830
- Good morning, Handy.
- Morning, Kent. Hey, looks good.

16
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:08,093
Yeah, yeah. Mornin', Harve.

17
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,499
- Mornin', Kent.
- Mornin', Harve.
- Morning, Handy.

18
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:13,163
- Morning, Harve.
- Morning, Morris.
- Morning, Handy.

19
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,468
Morning, Morris.
Morning, Reuben.

20
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,271
- Good morning, Handy!
- Morning, Stu. Morning, Fern.

21
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,609
- Good morning, Handy.
- Morning!

22
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:24,615
- New socks, Harve?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:27,151
I like 'em.
They go well with... each other.

24
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,778
- Thanks.
- Good morning, Handy!

25
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:33,347
- Oh, hi, Mandy. I didn't see you there.
- Oh.

26
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,587
Ready, boys? Get it together, now.

27
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:38,289
- One, two. Yeah!

28
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,866
Nice. Good job.

29
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:49,739
- Mornin'!

30
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,141
Mornin', Irma.

31
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:56,841
Hey. What you eating?
Hey, Bruce.

32
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,181
- Hey, Daddy's home.

33
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,186
Come on, Plunger. Get going.

34
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,256
- Hey, baby!
- Martha, good morning.

35
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,291
6:30 is too damn early.

36
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,587
It's not too early for Bruce, right?

37
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,822
Bruce doesn't care what time it is.

38
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,195
- Bruce got a little morning breath going.
- Do you believe this?

39
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,670
I mean, he decides to come a week early,
and they expect us to get all that work done?

40
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:22,332
Well, he's the president.
He's kinda used to gettin' what he wants.

41
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,342
We'll get it done.

42
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:28,141
Do you know what I like about Bruce?
When he's here, my nose looks normal.

43
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:31,706
Yeah, but his nose fits his face, boss.

44
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,686
- You're not funny, Bob. Let's go.

45
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,052
Who do we have writing
the speech for Tuesday?

46
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,058
Yeah. No, I don't like him.

47
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,090
- Hold, please.
- Hold on one second. Hold on one second.

48
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,073
Copy that. Go!

49
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,405
Lucky bounce, Mr. President.!

50
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,346
You know what they say...
I'd rather be lucky than good.

51
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,084
So, Mr. President,
what are you gonna do next?

52
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,589
Oh, so many offers, Chi Chi.
It's an embarrassment of riches.

53
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,818
First there's the Farewell World Tour.

54
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:17,727
Chance for me to say good-bye
and thank you to all my wonderful friends.

55
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,855
Writing my memoirs.

56
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:23,333
Then I'm doing something I haven't done
in 26 years... putting my feet up...

57
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:26,132
reading a newspaper
without interruptions.

58
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,902
Sounds good. Settle back in that
beautiful place you have in Baltimore.

59
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:33,069
Uh, afraid the First Lady
got that one...

60
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,443
in the divorce.

61
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:39,006
- Oh, right.
- She got the best years of my life.

62
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,780
But the one thing
she won't get is my title.

63
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,822
To the house?

64
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,414
No, the title, "Mr. President."

65
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,460
Ohh!

66
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,529
Unless donkeys fly...

67
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,599
they'll be calling me "Mr. President"
for the rest of my life.

68
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,000
She can have Baltimore. I'm fine
with my lovely little summer place...

69
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,572
Mooseport.

70
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,297
Four-tango-x-ray,
hold short of runway 1-2.

71
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:34,100
Sorry, Sally. We have the former president
of the United States on final.

72
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,334
We've got orders to let him land first.

73
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,342
- Hold short.
- Damn it.

74
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,118
Everybody, here we go.! Stay sharp.!

75
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:25,515
- Welcome to the Mooseport
White House, Mr. President.
- Thank you.

76
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,991
- All secure.
- Ahh!

77
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,562
Home, sweet home.

78
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:35,123
Uh, it gets more magnificent
every year. Ahh!

79
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:39,068
- Take the dog for a pee, Grace.

80
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:45,073
Oh, Jesus.
It looks like Tiger Wood’s funeral.

81
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,646
I'd like to go over some of these
speaking engagements...

82
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,215
Hold on, Bullard. I have to take
a quick cabinet meeting.

83
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,553
- Get in there.!
- Oh, hey!

84
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,357
Oh, sir.! I'm sorry.! Sorry.

85
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,364
Handy Harrison.

86
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,457
- It's an honor to meet you, sir.
- Get his weapon.! Back off!

87
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,297
- I got it.
- You all right, sir?

88
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:13,031
- I didn't realize one of the workers was here.
- I'm just one of the workers.

89
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,630
- I'm sure he's been checked out.
- I've been... I checked out. L...

90
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,767
Oh, yes, sir.
Everybody's been totally cleared.

91
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,243
I'll get out of here.
I'll... Let me... Yeah.

92
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,712
- Boy. I'm sorry.
- All clear.

93
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:26,546
I just want to say it's an honor
to work for you, really.

94
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,746
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

95
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,949
Well, uh...

96
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,420
I did come in here for a reason.

97
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,157
Oh! Right. Sure.
Go right ahead. Yeah.

98
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,165
- Sorry.
- Sure.

99
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,462
- Aah!

100
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,538
- I'll get that. I'll fix all that.

101
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,937
All that will be fixed.

102
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,945
The president.

103
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:58,016
At last!

104
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:01,086
Everyone, let's give the president
a little privacy, shall we?

105
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:04,520
Absolutely. We can go over
these offers anytime, Mr. President.

106
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,457
Hold on. Hold on.
How's it coming?

107
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,460
We're finalizing dates
this week, sir.

108
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,588
Twenty-six speaking engagements,
14 days, 120 thou per.

109
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:16,134
- And?
- Clinton got a hundred thousand, sir.

110
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:19,204
- And my autobiography?
- Random House is offering 14 mil.

111
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:22,433
HarperCollins is at 13,
but is offering a better ghostwriter.

112
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,010
- Ohh. Excellent. Keep working it.
- Here you go.

113
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,375
We're up to 147 honorary doctorates...

114
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,108
93 offers to be on the boards
of Fortune 500 companies.

115
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,481
Soova Motors is offering you five million
dollars to do a car commercial...

116
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,486
to air only in Norway.

117
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:38,182
And of course, the big enchilada.

118
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,493
The Monroe "Eagle" Cole
Presidential Library.

119
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,723
I like it!

120
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:50,462
European rationalism interwoven
with American modernism...

121
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,596
a metaphor of organic growth...

122
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:57,665
a man-made mountain
over which soars the Eagle.

123
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:01,372
It's fantastic.
Is it big enough?

124
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,746
- It's, uh, 40,000 square feet, sir.

125
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,911
- And?
- Clinton's is 20,000, sir.

126
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,885
Excellent.

127
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,356
It's the former first lady, sir.
Shall I tell her you're out?

128
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,359
No, no, no.

129
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,725
Will you excuse me?

130
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,798
Here he is, Mrs. Cole.

131
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,267
And the problem is?

132
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:28,170
As the man who has just gotten the most
lucrative speaking fees, the biggest book deal...

133
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,835
the most board offers in history,
I would think you'd know.

134
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,777
Come on, honey lamb.
You don't believe all that nonsense, do you?

135
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,714
No, Eagle. I believe
it's just the tip of the iceberg.

136
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,580
Charlotte, lamb, we settled.

137
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,051
Pioneers settle.

138
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,054
We rested.

139
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:47,125
- Seven million.
Don't forget... you're selling Mooseport.
- Charlotte!

140
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,126
It's a vacation home, Monroe.

141
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,355
You thieving, conniving, ungrateful...

142
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,797
It's been a pleasure speaking with you,
Mrs. Cole. He'll call you back.

143
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:58,735
Yeah, you too.
Try to talk some sense into him.

144
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,174
- Seven million.
- It's a negotiation.

145
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,870
You've handled dictators.
You've handled terrorists.

146
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:09,470
Terrorists were easier,
I swear to God!

147
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:15,047
Breathe.

148
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:19,215
Let the lawyers handle it. Breathe.

149
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,816
Ohh!

150
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:25,420
- Oh, Grace, you're a miracle.
- Oh!

151
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,558
Oh. Sorry.

152
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,570
No, no, no. Come on in.
Can I help you?

153
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:36,335
Well, I don't mean to disturb you.
I'm all done in here.

154
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,045
I mean, I'm done fixing it.

155
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:43,809
That flushing you heard...
that's work-related, not personal.

156
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,248
Oh.

157
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,479
Hey, we're done.

158
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,853
- What? Plunger!

159
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,418
Plunger! Plunger, stop it!

160
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,657
- Come here!

161
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,892
What are you doing, huh?

162
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,868
- Hey, you trying to get us both shot?

163
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:08,930
How many times I gotta tell you...
keep that thing in your... body.

164
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,032
Bad dog!

165
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:16,977
- You just let him do that right in front of you?
- I don't have cable, man.

166
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,260
Come on, boy. Come on.

167
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,599
Get up, get up, get up!

168
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,105
- Sally!

169
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,909
Spit it up, froggy. Thank you.

170
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,980
Sally!
You stay off her couch, Plunger!

171
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,174
Sally! Sally, hey! You up here?

172
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,148
- Guess what.!
- Downstairs.

173
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,686
- Hey, hey. Guess what came.
- Shh.

174
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,688
- Jane Ellen's delivering.

175
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,849
- Already? Wow. How's she doing?
- Sally?

176
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,018
- Here comes another one.!
- She's up to sextuplets.

177
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,494
Sextuplets?

178
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,861
Seven, right? Six. Seven!

179
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,866
No, six, six.

180
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,769
Chester! Huh?

181
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,781
Ah, you did it, boy. Yeah.

182
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,712
Oh, boy. Oh, look at those paws.
It's gonna be a giant.

183
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,722
I know.

184
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,723
Hey. So guess who I saw today.

185
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,301
- Who?
- Take a guess.

186
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,233
- Handy.!
- Come on. Take one guess.

187
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:47,237
The president.

188
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,433
Oh, that's right, because
everybody knows he's here. Okay.

189
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,569
But not everybody gets a check
for 17,000 big ones.

190
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,376
- Really?
- Seventeen thousand.

191
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,816
Man, you know what? I just, uh...

192
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,820
I think I'm finally ready.

193
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,227
Where are those towels?

194
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,335
- You're ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

195
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,969
- Ready to...
- To get the new truck.

196
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,310
A big one. A big one. You know, no more
three trips to the lumberyard for me.

197
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,351
- It's gonna be great.
- Dina, false alarm!

198
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,921
I'll take him.

199
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,583
I'm not sensing any enthusiasm.

200
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,161
I'm thrilled...
about your new truck...

201
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,423
really.

202
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:51,462
Hey, look, you know what?
Tonight, after the party thing?

203
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,334
Let's do something to celebrate.

204
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,170
Let's just go out, me and you.
A little romantic dinner.

205
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,245
- Sure.
- Yeah, it'll be great.

206
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,680
Okay. All right.
Dina, say hi to Fred and the kids.

207
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,812
All right. See you later.

208
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:13,619
- Plunger, let's go.!
- Well, he needs a new truck...

209
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,718
- So he can load all that crap that he's full of.

210
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,444
Here he is.!

211
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,781
You look great, sir!

212
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,789
Glad you're here, sir.

213
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,791
Good to see you, sir.

214
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:51,158
- Over here!
- Right here, Mr. President!

215
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:54,460
We're happy to have you here, sir.!

216
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,660
Glad you're back home, sir.

217
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,046
Here we are. Mmm!

218
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,584
- Morris! Morris!
- What?

219
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,813
- He's here. He's here.
- Al, "Hail to the Chief." "Hail to the Chief."

220
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,652
Welcome, Mr. President!

221
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,191
- Sir, welcome.!
- Welcome back.!

222
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:24,023
- Fifteen minutes.
- An hour.

223
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,256
- Thirty.
- Forty-five, and it's a deal.

224
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,061
- Okay.
- Whoo!

225
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,897
Yea.!

226
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:40,269
- Sorry.

227
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,348
Good evening.
I'd like to thank everybody for coming.

228
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:46,907
Tonight is a very special night
for Mooseport.

229
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:51,956
In the words of Hunt Langley, who put it
so eloquently in The Moose Call...

230
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,423
"The Eagle Has Landed!"

231
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,762
How original.

232
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:01,355
On behalf of the town council,
let's give a big Mooseport welcome...

233
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,367
to our newest citizen...

234
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:07,530
Monroe "Eagle" Cole!

235
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,935
- Whoo.!
- Yea!

236
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:16,173
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

237
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:20,116
As you all know, it's been over a year
since I vacationed up here.

238
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,119
So, first off...

239
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,019
to the rumor
that I'm only here because...

240
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:28,389
I lost my Baltimore house
in my divorce...

241
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,394
absolutely true.

242
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,659
- I am a Mooseport resident...

243
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,725
and even though I didn't get a chance to meet
many of you when I was up here as president...

244
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:41,431
- I certainly hope to...

245
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,340
I certainly would, uh...

246
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:50,779
- Hope to get to know you all a lot better.

247
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:55,013
Maybe we could, uh,
hit a few birdies or, uh, eagles...

248
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,452
- At your local golf links.

249
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:00,787
Anyway, since I'm not here
to ask for money...

250
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:04,852
I don't know what else to say...

251
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,864
except to thank you so much...

252
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,434
for your hospitality...

253
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,129
and see you around the burg.

254
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,228
Hear! Hear!

255
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,675
- Let's go.
- Thank you, Mr. President. That was great.

256
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,007
- Let's go.
- Thank you, Mr. President. That was great.

257
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,739
Uh, could a few of us
have a word with you in private?

258
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,315
The president has
a limited amount of time. Sorry.

259
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:28,318
- This'll take just a second. It's kind of urgent.
- Certainly.

260
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,718
- Right this way.
- Excuse me.

261
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,959
Mr. President,
I'm sorry the timing isn't better...

262
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:41,157
but it seems that your arrival
has coincided with something of a crisis.

263
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:44,997
Folks, I'm the Crisismeister.
Shall I call the marines?

264
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:51,537
- Would you care to sit down, please?
- Thank you.

265
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,203
Mr. President, Amos Harmon...

266
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:57,646
our beloved mayor of 24 years,
just passed away.

267
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,480
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
- Anyway, sir...

268
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:04,044
the town council met an hour ago
in an emergency session...

269
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:07,785
and voted unanimously
to beseech you, sir...

270
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,827
to be our mayor.

271
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,055
Your mayor?

272
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,830
- Mayor!
- That's good.

273
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,837
Yes, sir.

274
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:25,399
You see, before he died, Mayor Harmon
was running, as always, unopposed.

275
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,775
And with the filing deadline
tomorrow...

276
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,008
we were having a dilly of a time
trying to find a replacement.

277
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:34,176
And then Reuben here pipes up
and says, "Why not get the president? '"

278
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:37,187
I said, "Get the president!"

279
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,849
In our 240-year history, there would be
no greater honor bestowed on our town.

280
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,426
To have as our mayor
the most popular president in history.

281
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,793
Popular,
with approval ratings in the 70s.

282
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,366
- Eighties, actually.
- Uh, 85.

283
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,935
- Eighty-five.
- Eighty-five? Unbelievable.

284
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:54,233
Mr. President,
you simply must say yes.

285
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:58,571
Well, folks, uh, even though I'm not
in the Oval Office any longer...

286
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:01,578
I do have plans.

287
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,080
Sally, please.
We're in the middle of something here.

288
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:08,950
Sorry.
L... I was just... getting my coat.

289
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:12,615
- I'll come back.
- Uh, hold on a second. Sally, is it?

290
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:16,125
- Yes.
- Sally, you seem like an engaged citizen.

291
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,890
Uh, what would you think
about my being mayor?

292
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,056
Mayor? Really?

293
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,657
It was my idea!

294
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,294
Um, I think you should do it.

295
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:31,502
And then maybe you could do something
about that landing situation.

296
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,306
- The landing situation?
- Uh, yeah.

297
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,847
I'm a veterinarian...

298
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,316
and I had a critically ill donkey
in my helicopter this morning...

299
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,115
and I almost lost her because...

300
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:45,690
the president just had to land first.

301
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,955
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
That must have been a procedural thing.

302
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,929
- Standard security protocol.
- Standard security.

303
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:56,125
Maybe if you were mayor,
you could do something about that.

304
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,003
Hmm. Absolutely.

305
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,938
Things like that shouldn't happen.
I appreciate your opinion.

306
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,670
- It's really, really nice
to meet you, Mr. President.
- Nice to meet you too, Sally.

307
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,938
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

308
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:16,045
Well, Mr. President?

309
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,784
- I'm sorry, gentlemen.
- Hold on a second there, Bullard. Maybe...

310
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:23,692
Excuse me, Mr. President. I suggest
that we give them an answer tomorrow.

311
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:27,390
- Gentlemen, he'll sleep on it.
- Yes, l-I'll sleep on it.

312
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,024
So we'll hear from you
in the morning, sir?

313
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:33,229
You have my word.
You have the Eagle's word.

314
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,238
Thank you, Mr. President!

315
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,877
By God, that's just the way
he sounds on TV!

316
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:49,079
Hey! Sorry.
Connelly's septic tank broke again.

317
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,214
- Oh. Stood up for a septic tank.
- No. No.

318
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,519
- You look good. Yeah.
- Yeah?

319
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,894
- Eww!
- What?

320
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,191
- You stink!
- Too much cologne?

321
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,995
No, not enough...
Did you think about a shower?

322
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,501
L... Yes, I did, but then
I would have been more late.

323
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,902
I didn't think it was bad.

324
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:11,601
You know how you can't smell your own smell?
That's what we got going on here.

325
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,678
Yeah. So is this thing over?

326
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,077
It's over for me.

327
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,672
Hey, what do you wanna do?
You wanna get something to eat?

328
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:21,150
I'm not that hungry.
I think I'm just gonna go home.

329
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:25,451
What? Is it that bad?
I'll take a shower. We can take a shower.

330
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,684
I already took a shower.

331
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:30,728
- Come on, Sally. What's the problem?
- I don't know.

332
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:34,697
I'm just...
You know, for the past six years...

333
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,937
Today, when you said you were...

334
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:46,305
I don't know, Handy. Why don't you
tell me what the problem is?

335
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,777
I don't have a problem.

336
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,646
Well, that's the problem.

337
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,219
- What do you...
- I'll see you tomorrow.

338
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:03,088
I should've showered.

339
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,230
- Your newspapers.
- Good morning, ma'am.

340
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,630
- Beautiful, Ramona. Beautiful.
- Today's agenda, ma'am.

341
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,761
Thank you, John.
Perfect, Smitty.

342
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:15,669
For God's sakes,
save me from Mooseport, Rod.

343
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,834
- Well, how 'bout a job at the Pentagon.

344
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:23,005
- Gotta go. Good morning, Mr. President.

345
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,988
Good morning,
good morning, good morning.

346
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,556
- Oh, Smitty! Thank you so much.
- Sir.

347
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,752
- What's on tap today?
- Read the paper.

348
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,455
Finally! Grace, you're wonderful.

349
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,861
Then you can take that jog
you've been wanting to take.

350
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,993
Mmm. Fabulous.
Oh, uh, about that mayor thing...

351
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:48,004
Oh, don't worry, Mr. President.
We'll take care of it.

352
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:52,099
While the president is flattered,
he declines. His schedule precludes him...

353
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,645
- Actually, I'm considering it.
- Sir?

354
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,636
- Actually, I'm considering it.
- Sir?

355
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:58,011
Yeah, why not?

356
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,949
Largely ceremonial.
Any work involved you can do.

357
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:04,545
We run everything else we're involved in.
Why not Mooseport?

358
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,556
W-Well, sir, actually...

359
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,422
As your first move out of office,
you become mayor?

360
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:13,191
It's, uh, beneath you.
And from a P.R. Standpoint, it's...

361
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:15,630
Fantastic.

362
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,168
For the love of public service,
Eagle Cole...

363
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,671
the most beloved president
since Jack Kennedy, agrees to help.

364
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:25,539
Perfect. And don't forget
the Wicked Witch of the West Wing.

365
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:28,477
She can't claim this is a vacation house
if I'm the mayor, can she?

366
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,209
- True.
- Wait until the filing deadline.

367
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:35,684
- Then call them with the good news.
- Yes, sir.

368
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:39,587
Mayor.
We're going to run "Turdport".

369
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:57,135
Thank you very much, gentlemen.
I won't let Mooseport down.

370
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:59,506
You have the Eagle's word, okay?

371
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:03,047
- Thank you, Mr. President! Good-bye now!
- Bye!

372
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,673
- It was my idea!
- Congratulations, Kent.

373
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:09,743
- Congratulations, Stu.
- Oh, Morris, you might want to read this.

374
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,717
Holy crap!

375
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:16,453
Thank you so much
for meeting with us again, sir.

376
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,621
When we talked last night,
nobody else had put in for mayor.

377
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:23,064
Unbeknownst to us,
Irma Brisker, our town registrar...

378
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:26,467
took it upon herself
to persuade Harold Harrison...

379
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,869
You might know him
as Handy Harrison, sir.

380
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:32,171
Runs the hardware store. Doing some
construction work on your home, I believe.

381
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,802
- To run for mayor as well.
- Well, okay then.

382
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,541
You've got your mayor.
If he wants it, he can have it.

383
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:41,176
- Sir, it's a touch more complicated than that.
- What's complicated?

384
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:45,723
It's just that, you see, sir, it kind of
got out in the press that you're both in.

385
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,292
- What press?
- Well...

386
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:51,590
When the deadline passed, we called
Hunt Langley down at The Moose Call.

387
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:54,563
He said when this got around,
it would be national news.

388
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:58,227
Of course it will be national news.
Press will say I'm trying to squash a bug.

389
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:01,931
You can rest assured, sir, that not one
of them said anything like that.

390
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,065
- Did they, Stu?
- No, sir. None of them said that.

391
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,111
A couple of them called it "David and Goliath,"
but none of them said that.

392
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:08,975
What do you mean "them"?
Who's "them"?

393
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,980
- NBC.
- CBS.

394
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:13,243
- Fox. It was really exciting!
- Uh-huh.

395
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:16,514
What, are you telling me the entire country
thinks I'm running for mayor...

396
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,521
against the man
installing my toilets?

397
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:22,459
But, sir, you said "Eagle's word."

398
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,995
Ah, hell!

399
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,330
Stop eating the fertilizer.
Go on over there.

400
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,495
- Look.! It's the president.!
- Do you see him?

401
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,505
- Which car is he in?
- Oh, yeah, it's him!

402
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:39,668
- Company's coming, and Bruce is out again.

403
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:42,338
- What is this?
- That's Bruce the Moose, sir.

404
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,608
It's a rescued animal.
Handy's pet.

405
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,809
Shouldn't it be in a zoo?

406
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:55,120
- Afternoon, Mr. President.
- Oh, hello, Handy.

407
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:58,287
- Is everything okay with that water heater?
- Everything is fine.

408
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,762
- I just wondered if you had a minute.
- Hey, I'm Bob.

409
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,993
- I'm working for you too.
- Bob, nice to see you.

410
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,035
I'm sorry, Mr. President.
Bob, Martha and Irma.

411
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:06,626
Martha. Irma.

412
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:08,706
- Paint.
- Pipes.

413
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,674
Wood products, like your last two
cabinet appointments.

414
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:15,507
- Handy, aren't you gonna introduce me?

415
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,514
- Oh, sorry. This is Mandy.
- Hi.

416
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,050
Mandy and Handy. How cute.

417
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:23,211
- Oh!
- Uh, could we speak privately for a moment?

418
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:26,688
Yeah. Sure. Wh...
That's my office right over there.

419
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:29,316
Outstanding.

420
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:35,698
Excuse me. I have a private meeting
with the president.

421
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:45,275
Iguana on your left, sir.

422
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,447
Whoo!

423
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,779
- What a dump.
- Well, sir.

424
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:56,081
- This is it.
- Oh, it's cozy. Nice office, yeah.

425
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:58,747
Thank you.
How can I help you, Mr. President?

426
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,724
Well, Handy, as I'm sure you know,
we've both put in for mayor.

427
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,885
- No, I didn't know that, sir.
- You didn't know that?

428
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:07,487
I knew that I put in. I thought I was
just doin' the town a favor, that's all.

429
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,760
I thought I was running all by myself.

430
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,132
As you can see,
we have a bit of a situation.

431
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,104
Yeah, it's...
We got a bit of a pickle here.

432
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:18,869
Bit of a pickle. Exactly. So I was thinking
that one of us should withdraw.

433
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:20,911
I would be happy if it were me.

434
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:25,642
Lord knows I have nothing left to prove,
much less being the mayor of anything.

435
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,980
But I have a P.R. Problem.

436
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,748
Oh. Ohh. P.R. Prob...
Is it serious?

437
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:34,154
Well, it got out to the press
that I had given my word.

438
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:38,320
- Oh. Right.
- You know, "You have the Eagle's word."

439
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,661
- Right. Like on TV.
- TV. Exactly.

440
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,132
So, um... Well, look, uh... -

441
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,430
You're a golfer, right?

442
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:49,507
- Are you any good?
- I get around. I get around.

443
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,372
- Like a 10 handicap, maybe, on a good day.
- Ten? Me too.

444
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:55,412
- We should knock it around sometime.
- That would be an honor.

445
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:58,971
Well, uh, if you're trying
to make a name for yourself in golf...

446
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,814
you wouldn't, uh, start off by...

447
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,115
Oh. Nice shot.

448
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,019
Challenging Tiger Woods.

449
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,525
No, you'd start small... local tournaments.
Same in politics.

450
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,528
You don't start a political career...

451
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,827
by running against the former president
of the United States.

452
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:17,458
- Fine.
- Fine.

453
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:21,266
It was a privilege to run.
It's a privilege to withdraw.

454
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:26,043
- Well, it's settled.
- What's settled?

455
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,635
It turns out we both put in for mayor,
so I just withdrew.

456
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:31,614
- Chicken!
- I'm glad I could help with that P.R. Problem.

457
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:35,675
Bruce is out of his pen again.
Did anybody happen to notice that?

458
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:39,018
He probably chewed through the rope.
Bob, put him back.

459
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:42,150
I already did it. Oh.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

460
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,491
Sally, the president.
We just had a meeting.

461
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:48,794
We met last night
when I was being stood up.

462
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,529
Look, I'm sorry if I was rude to you.
I'm really embarrassed.

463
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,605
Rude? Don't be silly. No.

464
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:58,699
- What you said helped
convince me to be mayor.
- Really?

465
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,677
You're gonna do it!
You're gonna be our mayor! Great!

466
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,544
It is, isn't it?
I'm so glad I ran into you.

467
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:07,880
You know, I decided to get a dog.

468
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:10,454
- I thought you already had a dog.
- Yes, I do.

469
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,523
- A great animal. A shih Tzu.
- Westie.

470
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:16,185
Westie needs a friend,
and I thought if you were available...

471
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,694
let's say tomorrow night, perhaps...

472
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,595
we could discuss it over, uh, dinner.

473
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,225
- Dinner?

474
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:28,431
Yeah, I could really use
your, uh, professional advice on this.

475
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,633
- Really? My advice?
- Mm-hmm.

476
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:34,007
Uh, okay.
Well, dinner would be fine.

477
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:36,410
Great.! Looking forward to it.

478
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:39,711
- My people will get in touch with your people.
- I don't have people.

479
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,843
But I could give you my number.

480
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:45,684
Well, my people will get your number
and we'll set up a time.

481
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,749
I'm sure whatever time we do set,
you'll be on time.

482
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:54,093
- Absolutely. Looking forward to it.

483
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,534
See you on the links, sir.

484
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:00,035
- And thanks again for being so helpful.
- Yeah. Right.

485
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:05,870
You mean rolling over.

486
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:13,310
- Sally...
- You know, Bruce is a baby.

487
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,886
Babies like to chew things like rope.

488
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,556
- Ooh-ooh.
- Okay, then.

489
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,696
Sally, is it me...

490
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:35,068
or did you just get asked out
by that president guy?

491
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:39,303
Yes, I think I did. Probably couldn't
chew through this, right?

492
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,846
And-And is it me
or did you just say yes...

493
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,847
to the president guy?

494
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,679
Yes, I think I did.

495
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,756
Look, Sally,
I'm sorry that I was late, okay...

496
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,256
but you can't date the president
because of that.

497
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:57,793
- Do you really think that's the reason?
- Why, then?

498
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,830
Why not?

499
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:02,900
Here. Use this.

500
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,970
Shut up!

501
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:17,877
Sally, I wanna talk to you!
Sally, I wanna talk with...

502
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,644
Thank you very much.
It was very nice of you.

503
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,947
- Say bye-bye now.
- It's Irene.

504
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,885
Mr. President!

505
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,787
Yes, Handy. What is it?

506
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,460
- Mr. President!
- Thank you very much.

507
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:35,192
Uh-huh?

508
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:42,700
I can't do it, sir.
I can't drop out of the mayor race.

509
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:44,900
Excuse me?

510
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:49,412
I, uh, I don't have the Eagle thing like you,
but I'm a man of my word too.

511
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:53,177
Every man's word's important.
Isn't that true?

512
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,081
Does he want money?
Wh-What is it?

513
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:59,122
If you stay in this race, then I'm-I'm sure
you're gonna slaughter me, but...

514
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:04,886
I'm runnin' for
the mayor of Mooseport!

515
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,401
Is he losin' his mind?

516
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,596
L... uh...

517
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:24,303
- What just happened?
- You're runnin' against the president.

518
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:27,441
And your girlfriend's datin' him.
Mm-hmm.

519
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,420
I repeat... mm-hmm!

520
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,351
No, Larry,
the president has no comment.

521
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,791
No. No comment. Thank you.

522
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,262
That's all the networks,
60 Minutes and Larry King.

523
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:44,267
The handyman's girlfriend?
His girlfriend? Why didn't you tell me?

524
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:47,736
- I'm gonna look like an idiot.
- I tried to tell you, Mr. President. Remember?

525
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,866
Why didn't you try harder?
What am I supposed to do now, apologize?

526
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:55,036
- Back down?
- You want to call Bert Langdon?

527
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:58,115
For what? I don't need
a campaign manager for this.

528
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:02,277
- Hello? One second. Mr. President.

529
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:05,379
Bert Langdon on line one.

530
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:10,793
Bert, what a coincidence.
What's shakin'?

531
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:13,295
That's what I was gonna ask you,
Eagle.

532
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,298
It's deader than Nixon down here.

533
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,335
I'd be happy to roll up my sleeves
and come up there if you want.

534
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,303
Bert, I'm running against my plumber.
Is there something I don't know?

535
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:24,239
You watching Fox News?

536
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,606
The results are quite interesting.

537
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,679
The poll, of course, is preliminary...

538
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,476
but it does show Harrison
with surprising strength.

539
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:34,415
There's an eight percent margin
of error, and it's still early...

540
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:37,249
but it looks to be very close.

541
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:40,381
Seems to me the president
has got himself in a bit of a horse race.

542
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,516
Eagle, you with me?

543
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,993
Don't you mean moose race?

544
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:49,499
Eagle.! Hey.! Oh-ho.!

545
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,660
- There she is! Hey, come on. Let's go.
- That's her right there.

546
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,295
- Sally.!
- Miss Mannis! Are you Dr. Sally Mannis?

547
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:57,874
- Yeah.
- Just a couple of questions
about Handy Harrison.

548
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,137
- Hey! Watch it.
- Is it true you've been seeing
Mr. Harrison for six years?

549
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:02,644
- Now you're dating the president.
- Oh, no.

550
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:05,580
I'm not dating the president.
It's one date.

551
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:07,651
I'm not even sure
you'd call it a date.

552
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,118
You wouldn't call it a date?
What would you call it exactly?

553
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:13,816
- Just a couple more questions!
- When did he ask you out?

554
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,894
- Have you and the president had sex yet?
- For God's sakes!

555
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,833
Think about it, Handy.

556
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:27,200
For our mayor, we could have
the president of the United States.

557
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:30,206
- What are you trying to do to us?
- You know he's gonna win.

558
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:32,037
Drop out, you bastard!

559
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:34,668
- Come on.!
- Thank you, Reuben.

560
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:38,715
- And you better keep an eye
on your speedometer, Harrison.
- Handy! Handy! Handy!

561
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,580
- What's this? Come on. Ah, what's goin' on?
- Handy! Handy! Handy!

562
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:45,486
What's it look like?
You're campaigning!

563
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,024
- Handy.! Handy.!
- Guys, come on.

564
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,390
Hey, Handy. Do you like it?

565
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:54,158
Uh, that's... yeah. Uh, all right, guys.
Thank you very much.

566
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:56,165
The moose hat and everything.

567
00:33:56,267 --> 00:34:00,431
But, Irma, we discussed this.
I'm not campaigning. I'm not.

568
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,744
- What?
- Do you care about Sally or not?

569
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:14,784
No... Look, her going out
with him is just...

570
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,049
it's a casual...

571
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:20,920
Call it postmenopausal intuition...

572
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:25,223
but just my opinion...
lose this election, lose Sally.

573
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:29,732
- Mm-hmm.
- It's not gonna go anywhere.
He's 20 years older than me.

574
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:33,167
- He's the president!
- So?

575
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,466
Power takes 10 years
off a man, Handy.

576
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,666
Rich, another 10.

577
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:41,336
By the time you figure
he's in great shape and you're not...

578
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,414
he's younger than you are.

579
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:48,417
- Mm-hmm.
- So, you want to campaign or not?

580
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:52,117
- Hmm!
- Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm!

581
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,953
Better shape!

582
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:57,118
I know I can kick your ass!

583
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:00,196
Up and running.
So how do we kick this thing off, Bert?

584
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:03,893
Top priority, obviously,
is to keep him presidential.

585
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:06,333
Just pound
these moose worshippers...

586
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:10,396
with what his unbelievable experience
can bring to them.

587
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:12,976
Look, if they think about it
for half a second...

588
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:16,706
Harrison can't bring even a fraction
of what he brings.

589
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:19,783
- Whatever he is.
- And what exactly is he?

590
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,910
Preliminary research says
that he is something...

591
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:27,013
that actually we've never
faced before, Mr. President.

592
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,686
- And that is?
- He's a genuinely honest man, sir.

593
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:34,788
Oh, come on, Grace. All that means
is he's never run for public office.

594
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:41,530
- What do you got, Bert?
- F.B.I., C.I.A... nothing.

595
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,267
But this turned up in the local paper.

596
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:46,343
And, uh, that's it?

597
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:50,540
That's it. We're running
against the pie-eating champ.

598
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:54,311
- Huh.
- And think about this.

599
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:57,410
He runs for mayor, but only
when he thinks he's unopposed.

600
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:00,047
He dates the same woman
for six years...

601
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,319
but he never pops the question.

602
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:05,327
What's wrong with this picture?

603
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:09,331
He won't take risks.!
He won't make a commitment.

604
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:13,335
And any man who won't make a commitment
shouldn't be mayor of anything.

605
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:17,168
- That's good. How do we get that out?
- Whisper campaign, at first.

606
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:21,302
Then radio, and eventually,
we'll have to have some TV spots.

607
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:23,380
Shouldn't get too expensive, but...

608
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,211
Mr. President, I'm sure
you don't want to hear this...

609
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:29,184
but would the easiest thing be...

610
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:31,881
Should we discuss a withdrawal?

611
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:34,014
Withdrawal? Grace!

612
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,650
He's the Eagle!

613
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:41,255
Eagle Cole has never run away
from anything in his life!

614
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,765
- Not to mention what it
would do to his finances.
- Finances?

615
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:47,736
Book deals, corporate boards,
library fund-raising.

616
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:50,568
You quit or, God help us,
lose to a plumber...

617
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:53,735
we can kiss those deals good-bye
faster than you can say Roto-Rooter.

618
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,903
This is not about Mooseport.
It's about winning.

619
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:58,914
It's about spending three million dollars
to protect 20.

620
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:02,213
Maybe I should commit
to that speaking tour.

621
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,620
L... I, uh...
I had to cancel that, sir.

622
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,749
You... You what?

623
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:12,659
It-It seemed obvious. It was right
in the middle of the campaign.

624
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,628
That was millions of dollars!

625
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,927
Sir, there is still that offer...

626
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:19,127
from the Soova Motors people.

627
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:23,503
- The ex-president cannot do car commercials.
- But have you seen the car?

628
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:26,702
Look at this.
It's snappy styling, snappy president.

629
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,745
- Bullard.!
- It's smooth handling.

630
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:32,577
- Leather interior!
- Bullard! Get out, get out.

631
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:36,813
I'll handle the money, Eagle.
I'm sure that with the library
pledges, something will turn up.

632
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:41,153
- May I stay now, sir?
- Go in the corner, out of my eye line.

633
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,227
Oh, thank you, sir.

634
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,860
- I can still see you.

635
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:50,297
Yes, sir.

636
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:54,667
What about the girl? What about
this Sally-Handy, Sally-Eagle wank-off?

637
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:58,765
- He'll have to cancel the date.
- Whoa, whoa. No. He can't cancel the date.

638
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:02,039
You said it, Bert.
The Eagle doesn't back down.

639
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:06,344
You clear up what I didn't know
and when I didn't know it, I'll be fine.

640
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,975
- Should I draft a press release?
- Uh, yeah.

641
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:12,681
Oh, no. No. Um...

642
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,657
Call the press, have them over here
first thing in the morning...

643
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,661
and then get Handy Harrison here
to fix the toilet.

644
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:21,459
You see where I'm going with this,
or do I have to draw you a picture?

645
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:24,125
I see it, Mr. President. I'm on it.

646
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,669
- Let's get to work.

647
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:31,765
He's comin' in.

648
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:35,209
- Let's go. Let's go. Move on through. Move on.
- Oh, boy.

649
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,077
Uh-huh. Looks like an ambush.

650
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,650
Oh, boy.

651
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:43,515
- Handy, what are your policies?

652
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,150
Mr. President.!
Mr. President.! Comments.!

653
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,388
Folks, I need a word with Mr. Harrison.
Good morning, Handy.

654
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,397
- Good morning, Mr. President.
You got toilet trouble, right?
- Yeah.

655
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:59,060
Handy, uh, I want to make it clear
that when I asked Miss Mannis out...

656
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,037
I had no idea that you two
had a relationship.

657
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:06,200
Even though I find it reprehensible for
any man to interfere in an ongoing romance...

658
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,369
Me too.

659
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:12,415
I also believe that a woman's heart
is hers and hers alone to give.

660
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,451
Ah. Yeah. That's a good point.

661
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:19,114
Mm-hmm.
So, I asked Sally out in ignorance...

662
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:21,691
and she agreed to go.

663
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:26,456
And until she tells me to stand down,
I intend to see her.

664
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:29,590
- Fair?
- Call him a horndog!

665
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,602
- Did she say "horndog"?
- Well, uh...

666
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:37,936
If it's okay with you, sir,
I'd like to chew on that a bit.

667
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,642
Okay. Okay, you chew on that...

668
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:44,214
and, um...

669
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:47,113
if you find that you can't swallow it,
you let me know...

670
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,743
and I'll give you
the Heimlich maneuver, okay?

671
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:51,481
- Very good, sir.

672
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,557
Come on in here
and fix these toilets.

673
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:56,558
- So are we going to
see a date, Mr. President?
- Where are you taking her?

674
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,255
I don't know what you're gonna see.
Thank you so much.

675
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:02,332
- Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

676
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,765
- I'm in a great mood.
Do we have any ice cream?
- Absolutely, sir.

677
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:07,167
And I think we found a way
to solve your money problems.

678
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,171
- Really?
- Yes.

679
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,349
- Voilà.
- That's it?

680
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:25,081
Nothing to it. You save three million dollars,
and look... still beautiful.

681
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:28,750
Excellent, excellent.
Don't even miss it.

682
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:35,191
- Okay, everybody. Let's get back to work.
- Right away, sir.

683
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:39,435
Son of a bitch!

684
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:43,340
Sally!

685
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:50,210
- Plunger, you stay off the couch.!

686
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:52,441
- Hi there.
- Hello.!

687
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,178
Hey. Hey, it's me. What's up?

688
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,380
Uh... what are you doing?
You wanna go do something?

689
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:02,289
- You wanna see a movie or something?
- You know I have plans tonight.

690
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:06,022
L... Oh, that's right.
That's right. I forgot.

691
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,531
Tonight's the night you got a date
with the president of the United States.

692
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,796
- Uh-huh.
- Did you see this?

693
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,972
"Local vet finds romance
with past president."

694
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:21,738
- Eww. Where'd they get that picture?
- Yeah.

695
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:25,145
There it is next to the president
on the front page.

696
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:29,447
So what about later? I mean,
he must go to bed at, like, 8:30, right?

697
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:32,317
So, there's supposed to be a meteor
shower at 11:00. That could be cool.

698
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:36,257
- It'll have to be another time.

699
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,591
It's not gonna happen for 240 years,
but okay, I'll pencil that in.

700
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:43,565
I might, uh... You gotta...
You gotta tighten these.

701
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:48,001
- Look, if you're doing all this
to get me jealous...

702
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,869
it's worked, okay,
so could you stop it, huh?

703
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:54,775
Please? Can you just cancel
the date with the president?

704
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:01,783
So that's Wednesday.
Then Thursday.

705
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,719
- Come in, come in, come in.
- Thank you, sir.

706
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:08,883
Uh, Thursday, I thought you could
interview some of the ghostwriters.

707
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:12,019
- Oh, great, great, great, great.
- Where are you taking her?

708
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:15,758
The Pig and the Whistle,
the only steakhouse in town.

709
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:19,131
Supposed to be quiet, intimate.
Do you know it?

710
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:21,295
Pig 'N' Whistle? No.

711
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:24,238
What do I eat?
I mean, what do I talk about?

712
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:26,809
Do I have anything in common
with this girl?

713
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:30,813
She's a veterinarian. Why don't you
talk about mad cow disease?

714
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:33,713
- Don't, by the way, order meat.
- Why not?

715
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:37,184
It's just a guess, but she might not
appreciate your wolfing down...

716
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:39,722
the animal she spent all day
trying to save.

717
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:42,553
Good point.

718
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,560
Come on.

719
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:48,098
Wh-What, do you...
do you really actually like this guy?

720
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:50,996
He wants to talk to me about dogs.

721
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:54,730
- Why you all dressed up then?
- Because he's the president.

722
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:59,002
Well, then why are you
wearin' black underwear?

723
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:08,248
- Were you lookin' up my dress?

724
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:11,421
Yeah, I was.

725
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:15,185
- Ow!
- Oh, get over yourself. I hardly touched you.

726
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:18,159
How many times do I gotta tell you
how strong you are?

727
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:21,095
You knuckled my bone!

728
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:24,429
Listen, explain to me
the underwear choice.

729
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:27,003
- If you're not attracted...
- I don't believe this!

730
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,971
What difference does it make
what color my underwear is?

731
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:32,668
It's an unconscious indicator...

732
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,301
of your subconscious intentions.

733
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:37,880
Okay. Um...

734
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,650
How do you feel about the pink?

735
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,879
- No.
- No.

736
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:45,888
- Uh... what about these?
- No!

737
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,618
- No? Uh, these?
- All right.

738
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:50,489
Or do you like any of these?

739
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:52,960
I'm going to Sears tomorrow.
I'm telling you right now.

740
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:55,122
Oh! Remember these?

741
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:57,393
Yeah. That we're locking up, okay?

742
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:59,901
Or you know what?

743
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:03,030
I could always go with none at all.
I wonder what that would indicate.

744
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,705
Sally. Sally!
Put some pants on!

745
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:12,512
- Hello!
- Handy's Hardware.

746
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:16,017
- Hello, Pig 'N' Whistle.
- No, this is Handy's Hardware.

747
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,214
Good. I'd like to confirm
a reservation, please.

748
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,087
- You have the wrong number.
- Yes, I know.

749
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:24,524
For President Monroe Cole.

750
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:27,597
- Strictly confidential, of course.
- Confidential?

751
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:30,223
8:00, for two, yes?

752
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,859
Well, I'll be buggered by a bear.

753
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,438
Ah, yes, you will.
Look forward to seeing you there.

754
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,502
Move up a little closer.
Can you move that up?

755
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,510
This feels wrong. And pushy.

756
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:45,070
And him making her
his booty poodle isn't?

757
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,844
You have to stop saying that,
please.

758
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:51,887
- Thank you. To new friends.

759
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,382
Lots of em.

760
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:58,290
- This way, Mr. President!
- Sorry about the gaggle.

761
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:00,795
I just can't believe
they hound you like this.

762
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:03,731
Nah, you get used to it.
They're kind of like pigeons.

763
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:06,860
You throw 'em a crumb
once in a while. Hello!

764
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:09,871
- Thank you, sir!
- Hi, Mom.

765
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:11,873
Out with the president.

766
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:17,078
- Ah, that's great.
- Hmm, hmm, hmm.

767
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:20,981
- Are we ready yet?
- Uh, I hope you're hungry.

768
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:22,985
I could eat a horse... radish.

769
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:26,748
Horseradish. Sally?

770
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:29,883
Uh, I'm not sure yet.
You go first, Mr. President.

771
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:32,291
Monroe, please.

772
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,490
- Monroe.
- Let's see. So much to choose from here.

773
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,057
Um... I'll have the baked potato.

774
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:42,332
- Hmm. All right.
- Sour cream and butter and Baco Bits.

775
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:45,670
Vegetarian... Baco Bits.

776
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:49,769
Uh, I'll have the endive salad
and... a T-bone.

777
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,815
- Sometimes you just want a steak, right?

778
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,407
- Yeah.

779
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:59,615
- No turning back. Get in there.!
- Hey, hold on a minute.

780
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:02,317
- Why can't we go in?
- Ma'am?

781
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,793
- All right. Okay. Okay. All right. All right.
- Go on!

782
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:11,528
Hi. Uh, sorry, everybody.
Sorry to interrupt. I was just...

783
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:15,401
I wanna let everybody know
that I'm gonna be running for mayor.

784
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:17,474
And I'd appreciate your votes.

785
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:20,543
So I'll just hand these out, and I'll
get out of your way. Here you go.

786
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:23,112
I gotta tell you,
I'm voting for the president.

787
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:26,842
- Hi. Good evening, folks.
It's a nice night, isn't it?
- Handy for mayor.

788
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,942
Runnin' for mayor.
Hey, you got yours. Hi. Hi, Shelly. Hi.

789
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:33,489
Hey, just wanna remind people
that I'm running for mayor.

790
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,649
Yeah, we heard you before.

791
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:39,354
Instead of interrupting everybody's dinner,
why don't you two have a debate?

792
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:42,557
- Debate?
- Yeah. Have a debate.

793
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:45,567
We're not gonna have a debate. We're not
gonna bother the president with that.

794
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:48,399
Oh, no, no.
A debate's fine by me.

795
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:51,030
- There. You see? Yeah.
- Now?

796
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:54,508
Well, now is not the time
or place, Handy...

797
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:58,138
but, uh, let's say
the town hall Tuesday night.

798
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:00,148
That's a great idea!

799
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,844
- I'll think about it.
- Of course he will.

800
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:06,912
- Tuesday, town hall. Great.!
- Okay. All right. You're on.

801
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:10,482
Okay, why don't we let everybody
get back to their dinner?

802
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:13,586
All right.
I'm gonna go in the bar.

803
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:17,531
Maybe there's people that are
drunk enough to vote for me in there.

804
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:19,329
Good idea.

805
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:25,441
- What are you mentioning a debate...
- That's all right.

806
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:28,170
- I can't talk. I can't even talk to you.
- You'll be fine.

807
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:30,746
- Oh, come on!
- Look, I'm gonna stay. You go. Go.

808
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:35,581
- Hand these out.
- Take the truck home. Put some gas in it.

809
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,416
Hey. Hi, everybody.
Sorry to interrupt.

810
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:44,892
- Everything all right?
- Uh, yes!

811
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,929
Would you excuse me
for just one minute?

812
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,931
- Yes, certainly.
- Don't get up.

813
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,901
- I kind of know what everybody...
- Handy!

814
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,910
Get the hell out of here.

815
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:04,139
Sally, I have the right to campaign.

816
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:06,773
Campaign?
You're making a fool of yourself.

817
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:10,081
Well, welcome to politics.

818
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:13,155
Discreetly. Discreetly.

819
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,385
What's in it?

820
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:23,262
- They're, uh... It's beyond me, sir.
- What?

821
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:26,131
- Should I get it to the F.B.I.?
- Yes. No, no, no.

822
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,136
Here she comes. Go.
Dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dah.

823
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:32,140
- Mr. President.!
- Watch your step, Mr. President.

824
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:35,211
- It's going well, don't you think?
- Mr. President, sir.

825
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,770
- I've been thinking.
I suggest a handshake, sir.
- What?

826
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:41,680
Yes, sir. It's your first date.
I think that a handshake...

827
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:44,049
Grace, Grace,
I'm doing great here!

828
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:47,385
I think you're underestimating me.

829
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:50,153
Are you going to see her again?

830
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,991
- Sally, is he a gentleman?
- How's the date going?

831
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:57,225
Have you officially
dumped Handy, Miss Mannis?

832
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:59,666
Whoa! Was that a meteor?

833
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:03,103
- There's supposed to be a shower tonight.
- Ahh.

834
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:06,471
- Maybe it's a good omen, huh?

835
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:09,841
I just wanna apologize again
for Handy.

836
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:13,314
I certainly did not tell him
where we were going tonight.

837
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:15,351
I understand totally.

838
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:19,381
Well... good night.

839
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,388
- I, uh... Oops.

840
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:28,828
Ohh!

841
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:31,400
- Yes!
- Just a handshake?

842
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:34,197
That's gotta hurt.!

843
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:40,004
Little rusty there, Mr. President?

844
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:43,739
Mr. President.!
Crash and burn, man.!

845
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:46,577
Ohh.

846
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:50,585
Okay, here it is again.
The president goes in for the kiss.

847
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:54,987
Out comes her hand,
and no, thank you, Mr. President!

848
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:58,493
- Let's get this guy another beer!

849
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,232
Wait! Guys, guys, guys!

850
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,928
He was pushin'.
He missed all her signals.

851
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:08,766
And you, sir?

852
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:11,670
- Look who's on TV.!
- Uh, the president? Loser!

853
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:14,539
That's me! All right!

854
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:17,340
The president got vetoed.

855
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:21,406
Can you believe it?
Definitely the cold shoulder.

856
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:25,386
- Cold shoulder?
The president lost that one.

857
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:29,755
- Do I hear "lame duck"?
- Turn it off, all right? Just turn it off!

858
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,852
- Come on. Turn it off! Turn it off!
- Mr. President.

859
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:35,761
- There. It's off.

860
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,766
- Well, how do we fix this?
- We don't.

861
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,701
We concentrate on substance.
We get rid of this debate.

862
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:43,568
What's wrong with the debate?

863
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:46,198
Putting him on the stage with you
gives him credibility.

864
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:49,642
And he can be funny, sir.
Funny is your weakness.

865
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:52,909
- Huh?
- N-Not weakness.

866
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:56,577
Uh, uh, lesser strength.

867
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,711
- Oh, get out!
- Yeah.

868
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,951
Out of your eye line or...

869
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,256
Just get out! Out!

870
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:08,991
- Dyer, Cloud, break his leg!
- Yes, sir.

871
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:12,227
- They know I'm kidding, don't they?

872
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:16,396
I'm kidding! I'm just kidding!

873
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:22,211
Sally! Sally!

874
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:24,974
Sal!

875
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,346
Uh, I'm coming. Stay there.

876
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:30,147
Froggy. Green boy.

877
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:33,051
What?

878
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:46,434
Sally!

879
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:49,004
Sally.! Come on.!

880
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,870
The frog is empty.

881
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,437
There's nothing in it...

882
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:57,445
except frog.

883
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,949
Got a rock particle in my eye now!

884
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:15,054
My eye hurts.! I need a hug.!

885
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:17,827
Sally, just...

886
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:20,698
For a little bit, we're gonna talk.

887
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:25,741
Ow! Wh... This?

888
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:27,833
This was a joke.

889
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:30,572
It was a bad joke.

890
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,410
It's a little bit... funny.

891
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:38,886
Go to sleep, and maybe...

892
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:42,083
maybe we'll meet in our dreams.

893
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:45,093
Like... Like you can
connect a Nintendo...

894
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:47,163
from one player to the next player.

895
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:52,159
I'm blowing you a kiss.
It's by the window.

896
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:55,397
And you can tomorrow get it...
when you wake up.

897
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,702
Brush your teeth,
and then you go get it.

898
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:01,140
All right.

899
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:04,372
I'm going home. I hurt my eye.

900
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:10,077
Home. See my doggy.

901
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:13,588
- Hey, wait up.!
- See you inside, okay?

902
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,955
- Right. All right.
- See you tomorrow, Sam.

903
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:22,564
Testing, testing. Can you all hear me?

904
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,566
- Sally!
- Hey, Dina.

905
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:27,637
- What took ya?
- Come in directly.

906
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,433
Would you stop sweating?

907
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,512
It goes with hyperventilating.

908
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:41,217
We're all set, Eagle.

909
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:43,946
You'll be stage right,
showing your best side.

910
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,614
Talking points.
Issue cheat sheets.

911
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,692
Wherever possible,
tell 'em about your experience.

912
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:53,126
Demonstrate all the resources
that you can bring to Mooseport.

913
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:59,929
I'm not afraid of you.

914
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:03,403
- I can't feel my feet.
- Your feet are fine.

915
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:06,339
- I can't feel 'em.
- Don't be a weenie. Now, shape up.

916
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:08,911
- Is my hair sticking up?
- Turn around.

917
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:12,641
- Put it down already.
- Okay, shut your eyes, baby. Shut your eyes.

918
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,946
What? Stop it, stop it!

919
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:19,988
Look at us, Handy.
Motels are full. Stores are packed.

920
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:23,753
Do you realize that this is Mooseport's
first traffic jam since... ever!

921
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,158
We gotta have a second debate.
How 'bout it?

922
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,163
- No!
- Mr. President! Hey-yo!

923
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,426
My nose is making a whistling noise.

924
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,550
- Hey, Handy.!

925
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:50,882
- Sorry.

926
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:54,655
My fellow Americans...

927
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:58,626
welcome to the first of two
televised mayoral debates.

928
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:01,288
In the grand old
Mooseport tradition...

929
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:05,300
a game of rock-paper-scissors will
determine who will answer questions first.

930
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:07,302
Gentlemen.

931
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:09,338
- Show 'em how it's done.
- Handy.

932
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:11,168
Mr. President.

933
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:13,242
You know the rules.

934
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:16,938
Rock, paper, scissors.

935
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:18,947
Okay? On the count of three.

936
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:20,949
Go get 'im, Eagle.!

937
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:23,349
One, two, three.

938
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:27,116
- Rock-rock. Tie. Go again.

939
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:30,757
- Paper.!
- I'd do scissors.!

940
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,794
- Back to rock.!
- Come on, focus.!

941
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:34,693
Good luck, Mr. President.!

942
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:36,789
- Come on, Handy.!
- One, two, three.

943
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,027
- Paper-paper. Tie. Go again.

944
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:44,836
- Rock!
- Paper.!

945
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:48,844
Rock.! Rock.! Rock.!

946
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:50,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

947
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:55,617
Focus!

948
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:59,511
One, two, three!

949
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:02,182
- Oh, come on!

950
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:07,295
Rock breaks scissors!
The president wins!

951
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,597
I am now prepared to
entertain questions from the floor.

952
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:15,637
- I got one.
- Clay?

953
00:56:17,807 --> 00:56:19,604
Uh, some of them
environment people...

954
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:25,306
have taken to callin'
Ned Barker's pond a wetlands.

955
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:29,044
I been fishing there for 30 years.
What's gonna happen?

956
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:31,245
- Good question.

957
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:33,254
Clay...

958
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:38,020
I was the most environmentally conscious
president since Teddy Roosevelt.

959
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:42,064
Human population will not threaten
wildlife in this area...

960
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:44,326
for 200 years, if ever.

961
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:46,834
So you go right on fishing
in that pond...

962
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:50,235
and if anybody tries to stop you,
you send 'em to me.

963
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:53,832
Right on, Mr. President!

964
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:59,071
Handy?

965
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,582
Come on, Handy. Come on.

966
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:09,319
That's well put, Mr. President.

967
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:15,455
It sounds good to me.

968
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:18,762
- All right, Handy.

969
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:21,803
All right.! Yeah. Yeah.

970
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:23,600
Oh, Handy, come on.

971
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:25,936
- I got a question.
- My turn.! My turn.!

972
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:28,636
- Morris.! Over here.!
- Uh, Frances?

973
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:31,043
Uh, for 10 years now...

974
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:34,116
we have needed a stop sign
in front of Lucy Decker's house.

975
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:36,310
Nyah, nyah, nyah.

976
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:40,116
She has done everything except
burn down City Hall to stop it.

977
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:43,192
If elected,
what will you do about it?

978
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,887
First off...

979
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:48,930
I would convene a commission
to study the problem.

980
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:51,933
I would appoint a blue-ribbon panel...

981
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:56,438
of traffic specialists, right-of-way attorneys
and the Army Corps of Engineers...

982
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:59,838
to assess the situation
and make recommendations.

983
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:04,573
I would spare no effort to make
our streets the safest in the world.

984
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:06,308
All right!

985
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:10,576
Go get 'im, Eagle.!

986
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:14,123
- Handy, your turn.
- Gotta go for it.!

987
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,855
That's well put, Mr. President.

988
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:27,428
Lucy, let me ask you,
what's the problem?

989
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:29,368
Car headlights.

990
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:32,202
Ten years ago they tried a stop sign.

991
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:36,677
When cars on Bay Street stopped, their
headlights stopped right on my headboard.

992
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:39,714
- Have you tried curtains?

993
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:44,344
- Excuse me?
- You know, blackout curtains
for your windows.

994
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:47,514
- You'd probably sleep better, anyway.

995
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:50,525
Well, I'd try that.
Nobody ever suggested that.

996
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:53,687
Well, you come by the store
and we'll help you out.

997
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:56,094
- Good thinking, Handy.!
- I'll do that.

998
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:59,168
That's it, Handy! You tell 'em!

999
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,372
- That-a-way, Handy.!

1000
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:09,377
- Dad. Dad.
- Mandy Gutman?

1001
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:12,971
Dad, this is a question for Handy.
Is that okay?

1002
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:15,209
Well, if the president has no objection.

1003
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:17,946
I reserve the right to respond,
but no objection.

1004
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:20,522
Okay, Mandy.

1005
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:22,853
Handy, I was just wondering...

1006
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:25,393
now that Sally is dating the president...

1007
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:31,591
Does that mean
that you're available?

1008
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:35,933
Okay, people, can we keep the questioning
to the subject of the election?

1009
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:37,836
I think Joe had a question...

1010
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:41,399
Actually, Morris,
I'd like to address the issue, if I might.

1011
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:43,843
Thank you.
Uh, thanks, Mandy, for that question.

1012
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:47,940
Sally...

1013
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:51,020
I know I might not be
the best boyfriend, but...

1014
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:55,351
I thought we had
a good thing going here.

1015
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:57,426
You gotta know how much
I care about you, right?

1016
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:03,630
Why else do you think I got so mad
about the underwear with the president?

1017
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:06,429
Underwear? Tell us about the underwear!
Was it a thong?

1018
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:08,436
- Mr. President, what about it?
- No, no, no, no.!

1019
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:11,268
No, it's color...
it's a color thing.

1020
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:13,808
- Sally!

1021
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:16,538
What's the deal?
Are you going out with him or me?

1022
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:19,114
- Go for the Eagle.!

1023
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:23,117
- Eagle.! Eagle.! Eagle.!
- Sally, pick the president.!

1024
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:28,156
- Eagle! Eagle! Eagle! Eagle!
- Stop it. Stop it.!

1025
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:32,091
- Come on, Sally.! Choose Handy.!

1026
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:34,959
- Sally, which one is it gonna be?
- Handy.! Handy.!

1027
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:39,228
- Handy.! Handy.! Handy.! Handy.! Handy.!
- Sally!

1028
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:40,996
- Sal...

1029
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:43,163
Excuse me. Excuse me!

1030
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:51,445
Sally. Sally!

1031
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:53,481
- Sally.
- Are you crazy?

1032
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:56,711
You didn't answer the phone,
and you took the key out of the frog.

1033
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,810
- I can't believe you did that.
- What I said up there,
doesn't that mean anything?

1034
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:02,220
I heard you talking about my underwear
in front of the whole town.

1035
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:05,658
The whole country. That's how much I care.
You didn't answer the question.

1036
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:07,992
- What question?
- Is it me or him?

1037
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:13,194
Is it me or your new truck? Don't try
to make this about me. It's about you!

1038
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:15,702
- How is that about me?
- Ohh...

1039
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:18,933
- Miss Mannis! Miss Mannis!

1040
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:21,101
Man, she pushed you right down.

1041
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,940
Yeah, she's stronger than me.

1042
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:27,039
- It's not about me. It's about you!
- How is that about me?

1043
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:31,347
Well, you heard it here first.

1044
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:35,356
It looks like Sally is going to cast
her ballot in favor of the president.

1045
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:37,858
I'm Christy Adams, TVNN News.

1046
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:41,361
Yeah, baby, you're going down.

1047
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:45,264
So, what do you think?
Should I set up another date?

1048
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,859
- Why not?
- Excuse me.

1049
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:49,801
Grace?

1050
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:52,500
Grace? Well, what's her problem?

1051
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:54,906
Maybe she saw the numbers.

1052
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:58,378
You may have done all right with the girl,
but the debate was a disaster.

1053
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:02,110
- What are you talking about?
This is impossible.
- It's a small town, Eagle.

1054
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:05,153
The rules are different here.

1055
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:08,587
Uh, well, you guys are the hotshots.
Brainstorm.

1056
01:02:08,716 --> 01:02:10,445
Well?

1057
01:02:10,551 --> 01:02:13,918
Uh... sir?

1058
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:16,820
- Excuse me. Mr. President?
- Yes?

1059
01:02:16,924 --> 01:02:20,155
- We could eliminate him.
- What?

1060
01:02:20,261 --> 01:02:24,664
You wanna make it look like an accident,
of course. Maybe his brakes could go out.

1061
01:02:24,766 --> 01:02:27,735
- Oh, my God.
- Or he could slip on an oil slick.

1062
01:02:27,835 --> 01:02:29,928
What, are you insane?

1063
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:33,201
Uh, no, sir, I was...
I was just brainstorming.

1064
01:02:35,009 --> 01:02:36,909
Did I misunderstand the question?

1065
01:02:37,011 --> 01:02:39,070
Thank God
you guys are on our side.

1066
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:40,807
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

1067
01:02:46,654 --> 01:02:49,350
- Uh...
- Hello.

1068
01:02:51,125 --> 01:02:54,117
Small-town politics. Oh, boy.

1069
01:02:58,066 --> 01:03:00,261
Well...

1070
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:04,934
- I like three sugars.
- You only need one.

1071
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,803
- I like three.
- Three's unhealthy.

1072
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,207
- What's eating you?
- Eating me?

1073
01:03:10,311 --> 01:03:12,006
Yes. Somehow you seem irked.

1074
01:03:12,113 --> 01:03:15,048
- Irked. Really?
- Really.

1075
01:03:15,149 --> 01:03:18,118
Well, actually, I am a little bit irked,
now that you mention it.

1076
01:03:19,954 --> 01:03:22,422
- Would you like to know why?
- Absolutely.

1077
01:03:22,523 --> 01:03:26,482
Sit down there, Grace,
and tell me all about it. Okay?

1078
01:03:28,529 --> 01:03:30,121
Well...

1079
01:03:30,231 --> 01:03:33,564
when you... when we
first came to live here, l...

1080
01:03:33,668 --> 01:03:35,636
- Yes?
- Excuse me, Mr. President.

1081
01:03:35,737 --> 01:03:38,137
Excuse me.
Could we have a minute here, please?

1082
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:40,833
Sorry, Eagle.
We have an emergency.

1083
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:43,843
- Unless somebody's dying, Bert,
I don't wanna hear about it.
- It's Charlotte.

1084
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:45,537
She's coming here.

1085
01:03:45,646 --> 01:03:48,376
Howdy. Handy for mayor.

1086
01:03:48,483 --> 01:03:50,178
Vote for Handy.

1087
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:53,185
Go to court.
Get a restraining order.

1088
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:55,755
Come on, people.
We gotta do something about this.

1089
01:03:55,857 --> 01:03:59,020
- The sure way, sir?
- Dyer, this is too smart for her.

1090
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:02,187
Who thought of this?
It was him, wasn't it? Yeah.

1091
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:04,196
- Grace, I'll handle this.
- Yes.

1092
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:07,199
Handy Harrison. That's right.
That's who I'm campaigning for.

1093
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:09,201
Vote for Handy.

1094
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:10,861
I had dignity once.

1095
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:14,274
Does anybody remember that?

1096
01:04:17,745 --> 01:04:21,511
- Handy for mayor.

1097
01:04:21,616 --> 01:04:24,779
Why aren't you campaigning for the president?
Did Handy put you up to this?

1098
01:04:24,886 --> 01:04:28,083
Hello, Monroe.
What brought you here?

1099
01:04:28,189 --> 01:04:30,817
Charlotte, hon,
could we talk in private, please?

1100
01:04:30,925 --> 01:04:33,826
This is as private as I got for 20 years.
What's on your mind?

1101
01:04:33,928 --> 01:04:35,862
Well, sweetie,
if we could just talk alone...

1102
01:04:35,963 --> 01:04:39,592
- I'm sure we could work something out.
- Howdy! Handy for mayor!

1103
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:42,396
- Could we go inside, please?
- Fine.

1104
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:45,301
Why do you think
she's here, Mr. President?

1105
01:04:45,406 --> 01:04:47,966
- Okay, Neil. That oughta do it.
- Stand back, please.

1106
01:04:48,075 --> 01:04:50,873
The president's coming.
Hide the payroll benefits.

1107
01:04:50,978 --> 01:04:54,607
- Charlotte, would you step into my office?
- Yes, dear.

1108
01:04:58,119 --> 01:05:00,587
- Charlotte...
- Married couples have a shorthand, Monroe.

1109
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,417
Ours is nine million dollars.

1110
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:05,253
- Nine? I don't have it!
- Twenty-five years.

1111
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:09,090
A quarter of a century I endured,
and now you're pleading poverty?

1112
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:11,097
You took the house, the boat.

1113
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:13,759
You've taken everything but my title.

1114
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:16,132
Hello. This is former First Lady
Charlotte Cole.

1115
01:05:16,237 --> 01:05:19,070
I spent 25 years
with Monroe Cole...

1116
01:05:19,173 --> 01:05:21,232
which is why I'm supporting
Handy Harrison.

1117
01:05:21,342 --> 01:05:24,800
Yes, you heard me.
I'm supporting Handy Harrison.

1118
01:05:24,912 --> 01:05:27,107
Eagle?

1119
01:05:31,953 --> 01:05:34,012
Have I gotten through to you,
lambkins?

1120
01:05:36,324 --> 01:05:39,259
I never thought you'd stoop
this low, Harrison.

1121
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:42,261
I thought this was gonna be a fair fight
between two honorable men...

1122
01:05:42,363 --> 01:05:45,628
but I can see now that I'm up against
somebody who doesn't play by the rules.

1123
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:48,463
- Have you no sense of decency, sir?
- I'm sorry.

1124
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:51,902
Talk about hitting below the belt.
Bringing a man's ex-wife into it.

1125
01:05:52,006 --> 01:05:54,941
You're showing your true colors,
aren't you?

1126
01:05:55,042 --> 01:05:58,978
- Hey! I had nothing to do with this.

1127
01:05:59,113 --> 01:06:01,479
Mr. President! Mr. President!
- Watch your back.

1128
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:06,417
That's it. I've had it. I want 'em both.
Be thinking about a way to do it, Dyer.

1129
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,420
Sir.

1130
01:06:08,522 --> 01:06:10,422
- Is he serious? 'Cause I thought...
- No, no, no!

1131
01:06:10,524 --> 01:06:12,219
Mr. President!
You want a fair fight?

1132
01:06:12,326 --> 01:06:16,262
You just called me dishonorable,
sir, a-a-and I'm not.

1133
01:06:16,364 --> 01:06:18,730
So if it's a fair fight you want...

1134
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:21,063
just you and me...

1135
01:06:21,168 --> 01:06:23,534
I think I know the place.

1136
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:32,473
You're on.

1137
01:06:35,383 --> 01:06:39,217
What are we doing here, Harrison?
What are the stakes?

1138
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:42,221
- Mayor?
- No, sir.

1139
01:06:42,323 --> 01:06:46,020
Sally. Loser backs off of Sally.

1140
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:48,527
- We're both 10 handicaps, sir.
- Sir...

1141
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:51,029
- Fair fight.
- You're on.

1142
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:53,999
- If I could just talk to you
for a quick second...
- Show me the way.

1143
01:06:54,101 --> 01:06:57,593
Sir, there's something I'd like to discuss
with you about your ga...

1144
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:00,573
Eye line.

1145
01:07:03,277 --> 01:07:05,177
Nice shot.

1146
01:07:05,279 --> 01:07:07,270
- Thank you.
- A little bit left.

1147
01:07:07,381 --> 01:07:09,246
Right where I was aiming.

1148
01:07:09,350 --> 01:07:12,410
- I might drive the green.

1149
01:07:17,525 --> 01:07:20,255
Hello! Wait for me!

1150
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:27,896
- What are you doing here?
- Just making sure a fair fight's fair.

1151
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,902
Call them out, Mr. Dyer.

1152
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,938
I'm, uh, sorry, ma'am?

1153
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:42,212
Cloud!
You and your men, come on out!

1154
01:07:43,317 --> 01:07:45,148
Oh, shit.

1155
01:07:45,252 --> 01:07:48,278
Come on!
I know you're there!

1156
01:07:50,758 --> 01:07:52,726
All right, come on out.

1157
01:07:53,828 --> 01:07:55,796
Everyone onto the fairway.

1158
01:07:58,232 --> 01:08:00,462
Let's move. On the fairway.
On the fairway.

1159
01:08:02,069 --> 01:08:04,663
We're securing the perimeter, Mrs. Cole!

1160
01:08:04,772 --> 01:08:07,673
Secure it from there. Okay?

1161
01:08:07,775 --> 01:08:09,675
Yes, ma'am.

1162
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:12,611
Stay in position.

1163
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:15,614
Hit away, lambkins.

1164
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:29,359
Wait... W-Wait for the bounce.

1165
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:36,332
Damn. Take a mulligan.

1166
01:08:36,437 --> 01:08:39,338
We're playing for a woman, sir.
There's no mulligans.

1167
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:42,341
What? What do I do?

1168
01:08:42,443 --> 01:08:45,935
- You've never hit a ball out of bounds before?
- Not since I was governor.

1169
01:08:46,047 --> 01:08:49,608
You hit another one from here,
shooting three.

1170
01:08:49,717 --> 01:08:51,708
- Three?
- Three.

1171
01:08:51,819 --> 01:08:54,811
One, two...

1172
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:56,856
Shooting three.

1173
01:09:00,161 --> 01:09:03,255
- Excuse me, Mr. President.
- What?

1174
01:09:03,364 --> 01:09:05,229
You can't beat him, sir.

1175
01:09:05,332 --> 01:09:07,960
What are you talking about?
We're the same handicap.

1176
01:09:08,069 --> 01:09:10,560
Well, your handicap...
is augmented.

1177
01:09:10,671 --> 01:09:14,607
- What are you trying to say?
- Well, it was really Miss Sutherland's idea.

1178
01:09:14,708 --> 01:09:16,608
She had Dyer and Cloud...

1179
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:19,406
and occasionally me...
uh, we helped you...

1180
01:09:19,513 --> 01:09:22,209
with lucky bounces
and score card fudging.

1181
01:09:22,316 --> 01:09:25,217
Uh, you can't beat him, sir.

1182
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:28,220
Is there a problem?

1183
01:09:28,322 --> 01:09:30,313
No.

1184
01:09:32,193 --> 01:09:35,094
No problem.

1185
01:09:43,337 --> 01:09:45,430
That one's in.

1186
01:09:45,539 --> 01:09:47,769
Didn't quite get it on the green.

1187
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:51,810
No, l-l-I'll take it.

1188
01:09:51,912 --> 01:09:53,880
You two have helped enough.

1189
01:10:01,222 --> 01:10:03,122
Hi, Peggy.
Can I get a black coffee?

1190
01:10:03,224 --> 01:10:05,089
Sure.

1191
01:10:05,192 --> 01:10:07,023
Hello.

1192
01:10:07,128 --> 01:10:09,255
Hello.

1193
01:10:09,363 --> 01:10:11,888
- Here you are, dear.
- Thanks.

1194
01:10:14,301 --> 01:10:17,202
So, I hear they're golfing for mayor.

1195
01:10:17,304 --> 01:10:19,431
Actually...

1196
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:21,531
they're golfing for you.

1197
01:10:21,642 --> 01:10:24,406
- No.
- Yeah.

1198
01:10:24,512 --> 01:10:25,945
- No.
- Mmm.

1199
01:10:27,047 --> 01:10:29,538
Can I make this an Irish coffee?

1200
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:31,618
This okay?

1201
01:10:41,662 --> 01:10:43,630
Just...

1202
01:11:00,881 --> 01:11:02,781
Oh, that's a five.

1203
01:11:08,689 --> 01:11:10,623
- That was a gimme.

1204
01:11:10,724 --> 01:11:12,453
No, no, no.
There are no gimmes.

1205
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,859
- It was inside the leather.
- Yeah, you gotta get it in the hole.

1206
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:25,095
- I'll take a seven.

1207
01:11:25,206 --> 01:11:27,106
Actually, it's 15.

1208
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:29,142
Fifteen?

1209
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:31,541
- No way!
- Yes way.

1210
01:11:31,645 --> 01:11:34,307
- The president is right. It's seven.
- Yeah, it was seven.

1211
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:36,349
Well, let's count 'em.

1212
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:38,680
One, out of bounds.
Two, back on the tee.

1213
01:11:38,786 --> 01:11:40,617
Three, in the rough.

1214
01:11:40,721 --> 01:11:42,985
Four, in the sand.

1215
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:46,651
- Five, you missed completely.
- Oh!

1216
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,991
Six, uh, almost out of sand,
but still in it.

1217
01:11:51,332 --> 01:11:53,698
Seven, finally out of the sand...

1218
01:11:53,801 --> 01:11:55,735
into that sand.

1219
01:11:57,004 --> 01:11:59,734
Eight, out of the sand,
into the rough.

1220
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,332
That's when you threw your club
at the tree. Yeah.

1221
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:04,968
Yeah.

1222
01:12:05,079 --> 01:12:07,343
Nine, you almost hit me.

1223
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:10,212
Ten, you did hit me.

1224
01:12:14,088 --> 01:12:18,286
Eleven, on the green.
Twelve, you putt to six feet past the hole.

1225
01:12:18,392 --> 01:12:22,089
- That's when you said that curse
that I've never heard before.

1226
01:12:22,196 --> 01:12:24,255
Thirteen, you putt to one foot
from the hole.

1227
01:12:24,365 --> 01:12:27,198
Fourteen, you missed the putt.
You said, "That's a gimme. '"

1228
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:29,030
I said,
"No, there are no gimmes. '"

1229
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:31,730
Fifteen, in the hole.

1230
01:12:31,839 --> 01:12:35,172
Fifteen.

1231
01:12:35,276 --> 01:12:39,406
- Oh.! That was so close.!

1232
01:12:39,513 --> 01:12:43,540
All right, now,
through the sugars...

1233
01:12:43,651 --> 01:12:45,551
Mm-hmm.

1234
01:12:45,653 --> 01:12:48,178
And then around the saucer...

1235
01:12:48,289 --> 01:12:50,189
Mm-hmm.

1236
01:12:50,291 --> 01:12:52,191
And through the ketchup tunnel.

1237
01:12:52,293 --> 01:12:55,524
And the winner gets Morris Gutman.

1238
01:12:55,629 --> 01:12:58,462
- Married.
- Oh. Kent.

1239
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:04,198
Are you trying to get me
to throw the match?

1240
01:13:04,305 --> 01:13:07,468
- Mmm. Reuben.
- Who? Who's Reuben?

1241
01:13:07,574 --> 01:13:09,804
"I said, get the president!"

1242
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:13,346
That's a great idea.

1243
01:13:13,447 --> 01:13:15,847
The winner gets Reuben.

1244
01:13:15,949 --> 01:13:17,917
Ready?

1245
01:13:25,426 --> 01:13:27,553
I just need a do-over.

1246
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:32,692
Okay, Handy, you're up
about a million strokes.

1247
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,769
It's the last hole.
How about double or nothing?

1248
01:13:35,869 --> 01:13:38,030
What's "double"?
What's "nothing"?

1249
01:13:38,138 --> 01:13:43,633
Well, "nothing" is, uh,
we're even, tie, status quo.

1250
01:13:43,744 --> 01:13:47,840
Uh, "double" would be, uh, I back off Sally,
drop out of the mayor's race.

1251
01:13:48,949 --> 01:13:52,350
You got it. Okay.
Go ahead. You hit.

1252
01:13:52,453 --> 01:13:54,353
But, you know...

1253
01:13:54,455 --> 01:13:57,686
if I'm gonna risk, uh, all that...

1254
01:13:59,026 --> 01:14:00,926
you gotta give me something.

1255
01:14:01,028 --> 01:14:03,053
You gotta, uh...
Oh, I don't know...

1256
01:14:03,163 --> 01:14:05,063
What?

1257
01:14:05,165 --> 01:14:07,258
One throw.

1258
01:14:07,368 --> 01:14:10,394
- Throw?
- Yeah, I get one throw.

1259
01:14:10,504 --> 01:14:14,065
Because I can't play you even. You got
local knowledge here. You're killing me.

1260
01:14:14,174 --> 01:14:17,541
He can't throw either.
Bury him.

1261
01:14:18,979 --> 01:14:21,539
Okay. You get one throw.

1262
01:14:21,648 --> 01:14:24,776
But if we tie, I win.

1263
01:14:24,885 --> 01:14:28,616
Well, you drive a hard bargain,
but okay.

1264
01:14:38,832 --> 01:14:42,063
Yeah, baby.!

1265
01:14:42,169 --> 01:14:44,069
There's the old form back.

1266
01:14:44,171 --> 01:14:46,139
Okay.

1267
01:14:56,517 --> 01:14:58,451
What?

1268
01:14:58,552 --> 01:15:00,850
Hey, what... what are you doing?

1269
01:15:00,954 --> 01:15:03,252
Hey! What's that?

1270
01:15:04,691 --> 01:15:07,660
I said one throw.
I didn't say whose ball.

1271
01:15:09,596 --> 01:15:12,394
- You're out of bounds.

1272
01:15:12,499 --> 01:15:14,433
Click, click, click.

1273
01:15:19,373 --> 01:15:21,273
Good morning, sir.
Everything all right?

1274
01:15:21,375 --> 01:15:23,275
Oh, just dandy.

1275
01:15:23,377 --> 01:15:26,107
I'm a 10 handicap,
and I shot a 142.

1276
01:15:26,213 --> 01:15:29,842
You and I have to have a serious talk
about my handicap, Miss Sutherland.

1277
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:31,850
Now, Mr. President?

1278
01:15:31,952 --> 01:15:33,510
Later.

1279
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:36,555
I heard you broke even.
At least you didn't lose.

1280
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:38,989
The most humiliating round
of my life.

1281
01:15:39,092 --> 01:15:42,027
Time to take the gloves off, Bert.
Let's bury this guy.

1282
01:15:42,129 --> 01:15:45,292
- Well, sir, he's clean as a whistle.
- Oh, come on.

1283
01:15:45,399 --> 01:15:47,299
Surely he did something.

1284
01:15:47,401 --> 01:15:49,301
Knocked up a local,
grew marijuana.

1285
01:15:49,403 --> 01:15:51,303
Hell, I grew marijuana.

1286
01:15:51,405 --> 01:15:55,501
We'll find dirt, Eagle,
even if we have to make it up.

1287
01:15:55,609 --> 01:15:58,009
- Exactly.
- I don't believe this.

1288
01:15:58,111 --> 01:16:00,238
What?

1289
01:16:01,281 --> 01:16:03,340
Mr. President.

1290
01:16:03,450 --> 01:16:05,850
- I'm giving my notice.
- Your notice?

1291
01:16:05,953 --> 01:16:08,979
Yes. I can't work here any longer.

1292
01:16:09,089 --> 01:16:12,081
Are you drunk, for God's sakes?
We've been together 15 years.

1293
01:16:12,192 --> 01:16:14,092
Yes, exactly.

1294
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:17,095
And in all that time you have
never once gone negative.

1295
01:16:17,197 --> 01:16:19,097
At least not first.

1296
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:23,693
And you have never, ever stooped
to threats or... harassment.

1297
01:16:23,804 --> 01:16:26,068
Grace, he brought in Charlotte.

1298
01:16:26,173 --> 01:16:29,006
Charlotte.
If that's not harassment, what is?

1299
01:16:29,109 --> 01:16:32,840
Mr. President, you have two days...

1300
01:16:32,946 --> 01:16:35,540
two hours and 21 minutes...

1301
01:16:35,649 --> 01:16:37,549
until this election is over.

1302
01:16:37,651 --> 01:16:40,245
And then I'm gone.

1303
01:16:42,956 --> 01:16:44,856
What's that?

1304
01:16:44,958 --> 01:16:47,518
I think she quit, sir.

1305
01:16:47,628 --> 01:16:50,188
Not that. That.

1306
01:16:50,297 --> 01:16:53,061
Oh, this? It's a new poll.
Five points.

1307
01:16:53,166 --> 01:16:55,634
- Five?
- Down.

1308
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:58,068
What's the sample size?

1309
01:16:58,171 --> 01:17:00,969
Come on, Bert.
What's the sample size?

1310
01:17:01,074 --> 01:17:05,374
- Everybody.
- Everybody? This is a disaster.!

1311
01:17:05,479 --> 01:17:09,074
Not to pile on, sir, but I'm worried
about the book deals too.

1312
01:17:09,182 --> 01:17:12,083
Aw, crap. It's like
some mythic Greek puzzle.

1313
01:17:12,185 --> 01:17:15,416
"The riddle of the handyman.
Somewhere, the answer."

1314
01:17:15,522 --> 01:17:17,547
Sir, let's not panic.
This isn't over.

1315
01:17:17,658 --> 01:17:19,751
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1316
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:22,988
- What's wrong with us?
- What?

1317
01:17:23,096 --> 01:17:24,798
- I'll give it to him. It's that simple.
- Wait. You don't mean quit.

1318
01:17:24,798 --> 01:17:26,595
- I'll give it to him. It's that simple.
- Wait. You don't mean quit.

1319
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:28,600
You can't quit, Eagle.

1320
01:17:28,702 --> 01:17:31,136
I wouldn't be quitting.
That's the beauty of it.

1321
01:17:31,238 --> 01:17:34,139
I'll say how qualified he is,
how he's the best man for the job.

1322
01:17:34,241 --> 01:17:37,335
And tonight, at the debate,
I'll throw him my support.

1323
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:39,344
If I win, I win.

1324
01:17:39,446 --> 01:17:43,780
But if I lose, it's because I made the most
magnanimous gesture in political history...

1325
01:17:43,884 --> 01:17:46,512
and people took my advice.

1326
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:49,248
- That's brilliant, sir.
- Thank you.

1327
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:52,950
And then I'd get the girl. Uh...

1328
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:56,427
- Sally.
- Sally! Right.

1329
01:18:02,402 --> 01:18:05,030
- Sally. Hey, hi. I'm... I'm here.

1330
01:18:06,773 --> 01:18:10,300
I'm getting ready for the debate.
You wanna come in?

1331
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:13,868
No, I'm gonna get goin'. See ya.

1332
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:15,846
Hold it. What's going on?

1333
01:18:17,117 --> 01:18:18,948
What's all this stuff?

1334
01:18:19,052 --> 01:18:21,816
Oh. I, um...

1335
01:18:21,922 --> 01:18:24,220
I won Reuben in a putting contest...

1336
01:18:24,324 --> 01:18:26,849
so I have to make room
for some of his stuff.

1337
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:29,895
- You... what?
- I know.

1338
01:18:29,997 --> 01:18:35,060
I mean, can you imagine someone
actually playing golf to win a person?

1339
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:38,365
- Now, look...
- No.

1340
01:18:38,472 --> 01:18:40,372
Don't insult me by trying
to defend this...

1341
01:18:40,474 --> 01:18:43,170
'cause if I let myself dwell on it,
I am really gonna lose it.

1342
01:18:43,276 --> 01:18:45,403
- But, Sally, it wasn't...
- I said don't.

1343
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:49,209
- Easy.
- I just wanna settle this amicably. Okay?

1344
01:18:49,316 --> 01:18:51,807
- There's your stuff.
- My stuff? Wh...

1345
01:18:51,918 --> 01:18:54,443
Hold on, hold on. This is yours.

1346
01:18:56,156 --> 01:18:57,987
Remember?

1347
01:18:58,091 --> 01:19:01,083
From me. Christmas.

1348
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:04,596
Don't you remember?

1349
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:07,929
That was the year the power went out.
We had that big snowstorm.

1350
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:13,098
We were so frustrated.
We couldn't turn this on and watch it.

1351
01:19:14,508 --> 01:19:17,909
Then the power came back
and we turned it on, and...

1352
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,705
and you looked so beautiful...

1353
01:19:22,816 --> 01:19:25,080
by the light of it.

1354
01:19:25,185 --> 01:19:27,278
And then we...

1355
01:19:27,387 --> 01:19:29,548
You know.

1356
01:19:29,656 --> 01:19:32,887
By the light of it.

1357
01:19:32,993 --> 01:19:34,961
I remember.

1358
01:19:36,196 --> 01:19:38,790
And then we stayed up all night
and talked.

1359
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:40,867
Yeah. Yeah.

1360
01:19:42,035 --> 01:19:44,299
Do you remember
what we talked about?

1361
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:48,408
No.

1362
01:19:49,676 --> 01:19:52,076
The future.

1363
01:19:52,179 --> 01:19:54,943
We talked about the future, Handy.

1364
01:20:00,821 --> 01:20:02,652
Sally, wait.

1365
01:20:04,991 --> 01:20:06,959
I don't wanna wait anymore.

1366
01:20:08,161 --> 01:20:10,061
Good luck at the debate.

1367
01:20:10,163 --> 01:20:12,188
Are you coming?

1368
01:20:19,906 --> 01:20:21,874
She's not coming.

1369
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:41,890
All right, guys, that's it.
Two minutes. We go in two minutes.

1370
01:20:44,531 --> 01:20:47,295
Two minutes, Mr. President.
Excuse me, sir.

1371
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:50,301
My hands are shaking. I can't even go
to the bathroom. I'll pee all over the place.

1372
01:20:50,403 --> 01:20:52,303
Relax, honey.

1373
01:20:52,405 --> 01:20:54,305
- I'm not ready for this.
- Two minutes, Handy.

1374
01:20:54,407 --> 01:20:56,705
- Yeah.
- Be on your toes. Be sharp.

1375
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:59,711
You may have won the first debate,
but he's a python.

1376
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:02,543
Gentlemen, I believe we're ready.

1377
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:04,549
It's starting!

1378
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:07,848
Live, from the seaport
town of Mooseport, Maine...

1379
01:21:07,954 --> 01:21:09,854
the mayoral debates...

1380
01:21:09,956 --> 01:21:12,015
with your candidates
Monroe "Eagle" Cole...

1381
01:21:12,125 --> 01:21:14,025
and Harold "Handy" Harrison.

1382
01:21:14,127 --> 01:21:18,223
We take you now to your moderator,
Avery Hightower.

1383
01:21:20,801 --> 01:21:23,361
Good evening.
I'm Avery Hightower.

1384
01:21:26,807 --> 01:21:28,707
I am honored to moderate...

1385
01:21:28,809 --> 01:21:33,746
the second and final
Mooseport mayoral debate.

1386
01:21:36,683 --> 01:21:41,052
As is tradition, we will start
with a game of rock-paper-scissors...

1387
01:21:41,154 --> 01:21:43,748
- Handy! Not scissors.

1388
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:45,984
Gentlemen.

1389
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:50,261
Uh, Mr. Hightower, could l...

1390
01:21:50,363 --> 01:21:52,854
I'd like to make a statement first,
if that's okay.

1391
01:21:52,966 --> 01:21:54,866
Mr. President?

1392
01:21:54,968 --> 01:21:57,562
No, that's fine.
I have a statement also.

1393
01:21:57,671 --> 01:22:00,299
- Just... Okay? Thank you.
- Yes. Gentlemen.

1394
01:22:03,543 --> 01:22:05,238
Hey. Hi, everybody.

1395
01:22:05,345 --> 01:22:09,008
- Hi, Handy.
- I just wanna say one thing.

1396
01:22:09,115 --> 01:22:11,242
I'm a little embarrassed...

1397
01:22:11,351 --> 01:22:13,751
about the way
I've been running my campaign.

1398
01:22:13,854 --> 01:22:16,186
- Ohh!

1399
01:22:16,289 --> 01:22:20,191
An election,
it shouldn't be about personalities.

1400
01:22:20,293 --> 01:22:22,955
You know? Or... Or golf.

1401
01:22:24,397 --> 01:22:27,127
- Or who we're dating.

1402
01:22:28,501 --> 01:22:32,062
Sally, if you're watching this...

1403
01:22:32,172 --> 01:22:36,438
I was wrong to bring
our relationship into this.

1404
01:22:36,543 --> 01:22:38,443
I'm sorry.

1405
01:22:38,545 --> 01:22:40,206
Mmm.

1406
01:22:40,313 --> 01:22:43,214
I guess I did it again. I just brought
our relationship into it again.

1407
01:22:43,316 --> 01:22:45,716
- So I'm sorry for that...

1408
01:22:45,819 --> 01:22:48,253
too.

1409
01:22:48,355 --> 01:22:51,256
I guess what I want to say,
folks, is...

1410
01:22:51,358 --> 01:22:55,488
I think an election should be
about the town, about what we need...

1411
01:22:55,595 --> 01:22:58,758
and how we can work together
to get things done.

1412
01:22:58,865 --> 01:23:01,732
The president can do
great things for us.

1413
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:05,294
- Son of a...
- Bitch.

1414
01:23:05,405 --> 01:23:08,499
Having him as a mayor, that's an
opportunity that we can't pass up, folks.

1415
01:23:08,608 --> 01:23:10,405
Yeah. Right.!

1416
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:15,072
Tomorrow morning
I'm going to the polls...

1417
01:23:15,181 --> 01:23:18,082
and I'm casting my vote
for the president...

1418
01:23:18,184 --> 01:23:20,414
Monroe Cole...

1419
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:23,250
for the mayor of Mooseport.

1420
01:23:28,895 --> 01:23:30,760
Son of a bitch!

1421
01:23:33,166 --> 01:23:35,327
Ladies and gentlemen...

1422
01:23:35,435 --> 01:23:37,335
what you've just seen...

1423
01:23:37,437 --> 01:23:39,337
is a selfless act.

1424
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:43,708
Handy Harrison...

1425
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:46,370
is... Mooseport.

1426
01:23:48,915 --> 01:23:51,475
He... He is Mooseport.

1427
01:23:51,584 --> 01:23:55,315
He knows its problems,
he knows its pulse...

1428
01:23:55,422 --> 01:23:57,390
he knows its plumbing...

1429
01:23:58,959 --> 01:24:01,860
as only a person
who lives here can.

1430
01:24:01,962 --> 01:24:03,930
So tomorrow morning...

1431
01:24:05,565 --> 01:24:07,658
I'm going to the polls.

1432
01:24:07,767 --> 01:24:10,668
I'm walking into that booth
and opening that ballot...

1433
01:24:10,770 --> 01:24:12,670
that simple piece of paper...

1434
01:24:12,772 --> 01:24:15,366
that our forefathers
gave their lives to secure...

1435
01:24:17,844 --> 01:24:20,540
And I'm casting my vote
for Harrison.

1436
01:24:20,647 --> 01:24:23,207
Harold "Handy" Harrison.
Let's hear it.!

1437
01:24:32,425 --> 01:24:34,222
- Man, he's good.
- Mm-hmm.

1438
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:44,202
Well, what you've just seen, ladies
and gentlemen, is politics at its finest.

1439
01:24:44,304 --> 01:24:47,102
- Politics as it should be.

1440
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:50,108
- You did good.
- I felt like I had to do that.

1441
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:53,043
- Harrison.
- Hey. That was something, Mr. President.

1442
01:24:53,146 --> 01:24:56,843
You son of a bitch. You knew I was
gonna do that, so you did it first.

1443
01:24:56,950 --> 01:24:59,248
- I didn't know that. How could I know that?
- You bugged me!

1444
01:24:59,352 --> 01:25:03,186
What we have just witnessed here,
on this rare night...

1445
01:25:03,289 --> 01:25:05,416
- You bugged me!
- I'm not doing anything!

1446
01:25:05,525 --> 01:25:07,686
- Is a show of decency...
- Let me go!

1447
01:25:07,794 --> 01:25:11,423
- A show of inclusiveness...
- Ow.! Let go of my arm.!

1448
01:25:11,531 --> 01:25:13,965
A show of mutual respect.

1449
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:17,366
- Let go of me!

1450
01:25:17,470 --> 01:25:19,961
It's time to follow their example.
It's time to...

1451
01:25:22,709 --> 01:25:24,611
- Let go of me.!

1452
01:25:24,611 --> 01:25:26,044
- Let go of me.!

1453
01:25:26,146 --> 01:25:29,445
Mr. President, are you okay?
I'm gonna get it off!

1454
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:33,246
Oww.! Bullard.! Get it off me.!

1455
01:25:33,353 --> 01:25:36,254
So, Danny,
you see that debate last night?

1456
01:25:36,356 --> 01:25:38,756
- Did I. Was anybody hurt?
- What?

1457
01:25:38,858 --> 01:25:41,383
Miraculously not. Apparently
only minor bruises and abrasions.

1458
01:25:41,494 --> 01:25:44,395
- What happened?
- They're saying it was a freak accident.

1459
01:25:44,497 --> 01:25:46,397
Yeah, very freaky.

1460
01:25:46,499 --> 01:25:48,399
Apparently,
the stage rigging snapped...

1461
01:25:48,501 --> 01:25:51,402
and fell on the candidates
while they were shaking hands.

1462
01:25:51,504 --> 01:25:53,836
- Wow. Well, you know what we say.
- It's Mooseport.!

1463
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:55,908
Polls open in 20 minutes,
Mr. President.

1464
01:25:56,009 --> 01:25:59,274
- How about
a little music to vote by?
- Good idea.!

1465
01:26:06,019 --> 01:26:08,249
Good morning, sir.

1466
01:26:08,354 --> 01:26:11,346
Morning, Mr. President.

1467
01:26:16,796 --> 01:26:19,959
- Cloud, pull over here, will you.

1468
01:26:30,443 --> 01:26:32,411
How's your nose?

1469
01:26:34,247 --> 01:26:37,648
It's okay. How's your lip?
And your back?

1470
01:26:38,751 --> 01:26:41,049
It's just the lip, and, uh...

1471
01:26:41,154 --> 01:26:43,054
it's fine.

1472
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:45,056
Well, I just...

1473
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:47,058
assumed your back hurt...

1474
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,560
with, you know,
Irma jumping on it.

1475
01:26:57,737 --> 01:26:59,637
Well...

1476
01:26:59,739 --> 01:27:01,639
see you at the polls.

1477
01:27:01,741 --> 01:27:04,972
Wanna hit a few?

1478
01:27:05,078 --> 01:27:06,978
What, just hit 'em into the water?

1479
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:08,741
Yeah.

1480
01:27:08,848 --> 01:27:11,578
Martha's into scuba...

1481
01:27:11,684 --> 01:27:14,653
and in the spring she puts on a wet suit
and she goes and gets 'em.

1482
01:27:14,754 --> 01:27:18,485
Somehow or another,
I can't picture Martha in a wet suit.

1483
01:27:18,591 --> 01:27:21,719
Yeah, well, you're lucky.
I can't not picture it.

1484
01:27:21,828 --> 01:27:24,490
All right.

1485
01:27:33,606 --> 01:27:37,702
Oh.! You topped,
pulled and hooked it all in one.

1486
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:40,040
Here. Let me show you...

1487
01:27:40,146 --> 01:27:43,547
Mr. President,
you've shaken a lot of hands.

1488
01:27:46,352 --> 01:27:48,616
- Shake hands with the club.
- Like this?

1489
01:27:48,721 --> 01:27:50,689
Yes.
Now, just look at the ball...

1490
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:54,887
and picture like
it's the former first lady.

1491
01:27:54,994 --> 01:27:56,928
Just whack it.

1492
01:27:59,332 --> 01:28:01,300
Blood-sucking vampire.

1493
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:02,925
Aah!

1494
01:28:03,036 --> 01:28:06,403
Wow.! You two had issues.

1495
01:28:06,506 --> 01:28:08,406
Oh, Jesus!

1496
01:28:10,476 --> 01:28:12,637
So, uh...

1497
01:28:12,745 --> 01:28:15,373
how come you didn't ask her?

1498
01:28:15,481 --> 01:28:18,382
- Ask her what?
- You know.

1499
01:28:18,484 --> 01:28:20,452
Oh. Well...

1500
01:28:21,921 --> 01:28:24,890
I don't know.
I probably should have.

1501
01:28:24,991 --> 01:28:26,822
Scared, I guess.

1502
01:28:26,926 --> 01:28:29,986
Well, marriage is a scary thing.

1503
01:28:30,096 --> 01:28:32,496
I'd be the first one to tell you that.

1504
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:37,229
But once in a while there comes along
that special girl.

1505
01:28:37,337 --> 01:28:41,000
No, I mean, that's just it.
She is special.

1506
01:28:42,408 --> 01:28:44,137
I just figured...

1507
01:28:44,244 --> 01:28:46,576
eventually...

1508
01:28:46,679 --> 01:28:49,580
she'll find somebody else.

1509
01:28:49,682 --> 01:28:54,642
And, you know, you always hope
that next guy will be some loser...

1510
01:28:55,822 --> 01:28:57,790
not the president.

1511
01:29:02,595 --> 01:29:05,860
Handy, on the 16th hole
of our match...

1512
01:29:05,965 --> 01:29:07,865
you laid up.

1513
01:29:07,967 --> 01:29:10,128
Yeah. I remember. I did.

1514
01:29:10,236 --> 01:29:13,501
- You played it safe.
- So? You ended up in the water.

1515
01:29:13,606 --> 01:29:17,064
I never would have been president
of the United States...

1516
01:29:17,176 --> 01:29:19,144
if I'd laid up.

1517
01:29:30,590 --> 01:29:33,559
Sometimes you just gotta
go for the green.

1518
01:29:36,329 --> 01:29:38,297
Let's go vote.

1519
01:29:41,834 --> 01:29:44,234
- Out of the way.!
- Here he is.!

1520
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:47,738
- Hold them back!

1521
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,809
Mr. President, over here.!
Please, we have some questions.!

1522
01:29:52,845 --> 01:29:55,746
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen. Please step back.

1523
01:29:55,848 --> 01:29:58,316
No comments today.
No questions.

1524
01:29:58,418 --> 01:30:00,318
- Okay, thanks.
- Thank you.

1525
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:02,820
- Okay.
- Please.! One question.!

1526
01:30:05,325 --> 01:30:07,725
Kindly walk in over there.

1527
01:30:09,262 --> 01:30:12,493
The pageantry of democracy is working.

1528
01:30:12,598 --> 01:30:14,759
That's why we love Mooseport
so much.

1529
01:30:18,204 --> 01:30:20,365
Once a politician...

1530
01:30:26,679 --> 01:30:29,239
always a politician.

1531
01:30:29,415 --> 01:30:31,747
It's 10 minutes past the hour...

1532
01:30:31,851 --> 01:30:35,082
and there are 20 minutes left before
the polls close in Mooseport, Maine.

1533
01:30:35,188 --> 01:30:37,486
With the former president's campaign
spending millions...

1534
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:40,388
on TV, radio and print advertising...

1535
01:30:40,493 --> 01:30:43,792
it's an amazing feat that Handy Harrison's
grass-roots campaign...

1536
01:30:43,896 --> 01:30:45,796
still has him neck-and-neck...

1537
01:30:45,898 --> 01:30:49,129
It was so beautiful.

1538
01:31:00,346 --> 01:31:02,439
- Hello.
- Oh.

1539
01:31:02,548 --> 01:31:04,448
Spectacular, isn't it?

1540
01:31:04,550 --> 01:31:07,713
- I was thinking about...
- For once don't talk, please.

1541
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:11,256
- What?
- Just listen. Okay? Can you do that?

1542
01:31:13,826 --> 01:31:15,726
A long while back...

1543
01:31:15,828 --> 01:31:18,729
my mom asked me
what I saw in you.

1544
01:31:18,831 --> 01:31:22,392
You probably find it hard to believe
that anybody could ask such a thing...

1545
01:31:22,502 --> 01:31:24,470
but she did.

1546
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:29,538
"I see a man I admire," I told her.

1547
01:31:29,642 --> 01:31:34,170
"A flawed man, certainly,
but a man with principles."

1548
01:31:35,648 --> 01:31:37,616
Since this Handy thing...

1549
01:31:39,118 --> 01:31:41,018
I've seen a man...

1550
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:44,578
who only cares about ego and power...

1551
01:31:44,690 --> 01:31:48,126
a man who will stoop to anything...

1552
01:31:48,227 --> 01:31:51,128
to win a position
he doesn't even want...

1553
01:31:51,230 --> 01:31:54,324
from someone he probably
shouldn't even beat.

1554
01:31:54,434 --> 01:31:58,666
And it angers me, and it upsets me.

1555
01:31:58,771 --> 01:32:01,672
- Oh, and mostly it just makes me sad.
- Grace...

1556
01:32:01,774 --> 01:32:05,642
Because... you used to be
better than that, Monroe.

1557
01:32:05,745 --> 01:32:07,713
You really were.

1558
01:32:18,391 --> 01:32:21,690
And that is no handshake,
you son of a bitch.

1559
01:32:34,073 --> 01:32:35,904
Sugar, Mr. President?

1560
01:32:36,008 --> 01:32:38,408
Oh, uh, three, please.

1561
01:32:38,511 --> 01:32:41,503
No, no, no. One.

1562
01:32:41,614 --> 01:32:43,878
- Good morning, Mr. President.
- Good morning.

1563
01:32:43,983 --> 01:32:45,644
Where's Grace?

1564
01:32:45,751 --> 01:32:48,345
- I don't know, sir.
- Could you find her, please?

1565
01:32:48,454 --> 01:32:50,615
Yes, sir. Let's go.

1566
01:32:53,893 --> 01:32:57,954
Eagle, we gotta get moving. They want you
down in town for the announcement.

1567
01:32:58,064 --> 01:33:02,091
Announcement? I can't expose myself to
an announcement without knowing who won.

1568
01:33:02,201 --> 01:33:04,101
They won't tell me, Eagle.

1569
01:33:04,203 --> 01:33:06,103
I've done everything
short of bribing them...

1570
01:33:06,205 --> 01:33:08,673
with a year's supply
of beer and night crawlers...

1571
01:33:08,774 --> 01:33:11,106
but I'll get down there
and work on it.

1572
01:33:11,210 --> 01:33:14,111
Get on that toga and get down
to that circus, Eagle.

1573
01:33:14,213 --> 01:33:17,444
Please, sir.

1574
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:20,610
Sally, um...

1575
01:33:21,787 --> 01:33:24,779
Handy.! You back here?

1576
01:33:24,891 --> 01:33:26,984
- Uh, hey.
- It's time, man.

1577
01:33:27,093 --> 01:33:31,462
- Yeah, I know.
- Don't you want to find out
if you won or lost... badly?

1578
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:34,158
- I'm gonna... Yeah, go ahead.
- No, I'll wait for ya.

1579
01:33:34,267 --> 01:33:36,064
- I'm gonna meet you there.
- I want to.
- No, go.

1580
01:33:36,168 --> 01:33:38,261
You're my ride, man.
Come on!

1581
01:33:38,371 --> 01:33:40,271
Okay. All right. Let's go.

1582
01:33:49,015 --> 01:33:50,915
In a few moments...

1583
01:33:51,017 --> 01:33:54,316
Former President Cole and Harold
"Handy" Harrison are due to arrive.

1584
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:57,912
Will big politics and big money carry
the day, or will the little man prevail?

1585
01:33:58,024 --> 01:34:00,925
- We shall soon see.
- Testing.! Testing, testing.!

1586
01:34:01,027 --> 01:34:02,927
We're just about ready to start.

1587
01:34:03,029 --> 01:34:05,930
And, uh... Ah! I think I see
the president coming now!

1588
01:34:06,032 --> 01:34:08,432
- Whoo-hoo!

1589
01:34:10,202 --> 01:34:12,466
- And, oh, there's Handy.

1590
01:34:12,572 --> 01:34:14,870
- Hey... Hey, did you see Sally?
- No.

1591
01:34:14,974 --> 01:34:18,375
- Hmm. Well, when you see her,
just let me know. Okay?
- Okay, okay.

1592
01:34:18,477 --> 01:34:21,446
Mr. President, Handy,
just come up here. Okay?

1593
01:34:21,547 --> 01:34:24,448
- Sir, the yellow speech is if you win.
- Okay.

1594
01:34:24,550 --> 01:34:27,451
The blue one is if you, uh...

1595
01:34:27,553 --> 01:34:30,454
Should I get out of your eye line, sir?

1596
01:34:30,556 --> 01:34:32,990
Ah, come on, boy.

1597
01:34:34,093 --> 01:34:36,823
- Hey! How you doing?
- How you doin'?

1598
01:34:36,929 --> 01:34:38,829
They're all here.

1599
01:34:38,931 --> 01:34:40,865
Thank you, sir. Again?

1600
01:34:43,069 --> 01:34:45,833
Yeah!

1601
01:34:47,173 --> 01:34:49,505
- Handy, you're the man.!

1602
01:34:49,609 --> 01:34:51,474
We need you, Mr. President!

1603
01:34:51,577 --> 01:34:54,478
In the 240-year history
of our fair Mooseport...

1604
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:58,072
there has never been
a more exciting mayoral race!

1605
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:04,321
Mr. President? Handy?

1606
01:35:04,423 --> 01:35:08,189
My fellow citizens,
the new mayor of Mooseport is...

1607
01:35:11,797 --> 01:35:13,697
Monroe Cole!

1608
01:35:19,972 --> 01:35:21,940
- Congratulations.
- Oh. Thank you.

1609
01:35:24,677 --> 01:35:29,512
As I'm sure you all know, this was
Mooseport's largest election turnout ever!

1610
01:35:29,615 --> 01:35:32,049
- How big a margin?
- Tight. Real tight.

1611
01:35:32,151 --> 01:35:34,051
But the win's the thing.

1612
01:35:34,153 --> 01:35:36,053
- It was so close.
- Well, that's something.

1613
01:35:36,155 --> 01:35:38,055
- Right?
- Yeah.

1614
01:35:38,157 --> 01:35:40,557
In the end, the president won...

1615
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:42,560
by one vote!

1616
01:35:42,662 --> 01:35:44,562
- You won by one vote.

1617
01:35:44,664 --> 01:35:47,360
One vote? Oh, my God.

1618
01:35:47,466 --> 01:35:49,366
It doesn't get any closer.!

1619
01:35:49,468 --> 01:35:51,868
Wow.

1620
01:35:51,971 --> 01:35:53,871
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- My vote.

1621
01:35:53,973 --> 01:35:57,033
The 23rd mayor of Mooseport...

1622
01:35:57,143 --> 01:35:58,872
Monroe "Eagle" Cole!

1623
01:36:02,415 --> 01:36:05,043
- Thank you, Morris.

1624
01:36:05,151 --> 01:36:07,517
Thank you, everybody.

1625
01:36:08,621 --> 01:36:10,521
Ladies and gentlemen...

1626
01:36:10,623 --> 01:36:12,523
once again...

1627
01:36:12,625 --> 01:36:15,958
the great American electoral process...

1628
01:36:16,062 --> 01:36:18,030
has...

1629
01:36:24,870 --> 01:36:26,770
Folks...

1630
01:36:26,872 --> 01:36:28,931
you know...

1631
01:36:29,041 --> 01:36:32,738
a little while ago a person
who has been with me for years...

1632
01:36:32,845 --> 01:36:35,939
a person who I trust
like no one else...

1633
01:36:36,048 --> 01:36:39,381
reminded me of my principles.

1634
01:36:39,485 --> 01:36:41,385
Shook some sense into me.

1635
01:36:41,487 --> 01:36:43,887
So I have a confession to make.

1636
01:36:43,989 --> 01:36:45,889
I said...

1637
01:36:45,991 --> 01:36:47,891
that I would vote for Handy.

1638
01:36:47,993 --> 01:36:50,587
L-I didn't. I voted for myself.

1639
01:36:50,696 --> 01:36:52,527
- What?

1640
01:36:56,602 --> 01:36:58,502
So my first act as mayor...

1641
01:36:58,604 --> 01:37:02,199
is to turn the job over to
the rightful winner, Handy Harrison.

1642
01:37:02,308 --> 01:37:05,436
Handy, come on over here.
Let's hear it for Handy.

1643
01:37:05,544 --> 01:37:08,274
Go, Handy.! All right.!

1644
01:37:09,548 --> 01:37:11,140
Whoo! All right!

1645
01:37:11,250 --> 01:37:13,184
- Come on.
- Handy.! Handy.!

1646
01:37:13,285 --> 01:37:15,310
- Ah!
- Mr. President, l...

1647
01:37:15,421 --> 01:37:17,321
Attaboy, Handy.!

1648
01:37:17,423 --> 01:37:19,857
Folks, I have a confession
to make also.

1649
01:37:24,930 --> 01:37:27,364
- I voted for myself too.
- What?

1650
01:37:29,935 --> 01:37:33,336
You won this thing fair and square,
Mr. President.

1651
01:37:33,439 --> 01:37:38,638
So my first act as mayor is to turn
the job back over to the rightful winner...

1652
01:37:38,744 --> 01:37:40,905
Mr. Monroe Cole!

1653
01:37:41,013 --> 01:37:42,878
- Yeah! Yeah!

1654
01:37:42,982 --> 01:37:44,847
Hmph!

1655
01:37:44,950 --> 01:37:47,544
There's no beating you, is there?

1656
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:50,247
Not on this one, sir.

1657
01:37:50,356 --> 01:37:53,052
All right, I accept.

1658
01:37:58,597 --> 01:38:00,997
No, he won.

1659
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:04,536
Well, tell HarperCollins
Random House is back up to 20 mil.

1660
01:38:04,637 --> 01:38:07,538
Yes, please do.

1661
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:10,074
And tell them to send me half.

1662
01:38:11,477 --> 01:38:13,945
- See you in D.C.

1663
01:38:18,851 --> 01:38:22,252
- Any sign of her?
- Yes, sir. Agent Cloud found her.
She's at the airport.

1664
01:38:22,354 --> 01:38:25,084
Airport? Come on.
Let's get moving.

1665
01:38:27,193 --> 01:38:30,685
Look, Sally, uh, I don't know...

1666
01:38:30,796 --> 01:38:32,696
- Uh...
- Hey, Handy.

1667
01:38:32,798 --> 01:38:34,698
- Nice try.
- Oh, thank you.

1668
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:37,030
- Hi, Handy.
- Hi, Sophie. Hi.

1669
01:38:40,039 --> 01:38:42,735
Look, Sally...

1670
01:38:42,842 --> 01:38:44,742
How you doin'?

1671
01:38:44,844 --> 01:38:47,813
God, just... just do it.

1672
01:38:47,913 --> 01:38:49,813
- Just...
- Hey, Handy!

1673
01:38:49,915 --> 01:38:52,884
I just saw what you did!
I couldn't believe it!

1674
01:38:52,985 --> 01:38:54,885
Thank you, Reuben. Yeah.

1675
01:38:54,987 --> 01:38:56,887
I voted for you! Ah!

1676
01:38:56,989 --> 01:39:00,049
Oh... Oh, well...
You don't even like me. Sorry.

1677
01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:02,127
Oh, God.

1678
01:39:04,964 --> 01:39:07,262
Huh? What?

1679
01:39:08,734 --> 01:39:11,100
Oh... no.

1680
01:39:11,203 --> 01:39:13,330
No. No.
Please, please, please.

1681
01:39:13,439 --> 01:39:15,600
No!

1682
01:39:16,942 --> 01:39:18,910
Oh, nice!

1683
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:29,920
Ladies and gentlemen...

1684
01:39:30,022 --> 01:39:34,118
Trans Capital Flight 27
to Dulles has been delayed.

1685
01:39:34,226 --> 01:39:35,853
- Please bear with us.

1686
01:39:35,961 --> 01:39:37,826
We'll let you know as soon as we know.

1687
01:39:37,930 --> 01:39:39,795
Grace?

1688
01:39:41,367 --> 01:39:43,494
- Grace.
- Here, Mr. President.

1689
01:39:44,570 --> 01:39:46,629
Is that him?

1690
01:39:46,739 --> 01:39:48,866
What are you doing here?

1691
01:39:48,974 --> 01:39:50,805
I gave my notice. Remember?

1692
01:39:50,910 --> 01:39:52,673
Oh, Grace. Come back.

1693
01:39:52,778 --> 01:39:54,439
No.

1694
01:39:56,615 --> 01:39:58,981
No.

1695
01:39:59,084 --> 01:40:02,542
Grace, look at me.

1696
01:40:02,655 --> 01:40:07,524
I'll never have more than one sugar in my
coffee the rest of my life if you'll have me.

1697
01:40:08,994 --> 01:40:10,621
And no salt.

1698
01:40:12,564 --> 01:40:14,964
The former president
of the United States...

1699
01:40:15,067 --> 01:40:17,035
is down on his knees.

1700
01:40:21,774 --> 01:40:23,366
- Yeah.!
- All right.!

1701
01:40:27,813 --> 01:40:29,906
That's no handshake either.

1702
01:40:31,183 --> 01:40:33,651
- I'll go down on my knees again...
- No. No, no.

1703
01:40:35,988 --> 01:40:38,513
You certainly took your time.

1704
01:40:38,624 --> 01:40:40,524
What if my plane had left?

1705
01:40:40,626 --> 01:40:42,526
Oh, you haven't heard.

1706
01:40:42,628 --> 01:40:44,596
I'm the mayor now.

1707
01:40:45,631 --> 01:40:48,122
This is Cloud. Clear the flight.

1708
01:40:48,233 --> 01:40:51,168
Turns out that I have a little bit
of pull here at this airport now.

1709
01:40:51,270 --> 01:40:54,000
Flight 27 passengers...

1710
01:40:54,106 --> 01:40:57,007
we've now been cleared for takeoff.

1711
01:40:57,109 --> 01:41:00,010
- Congratulations, Mr. President.

1712
01:41:00,112 --> 01:41:03,513
That would be congratulations,
Mr. Mayor.

1713
01:41:06,018 --> 01:41:09,010
- Congratulations, Mr. Mayor!
- Great.

1714
01:41:09,121 --> 01:41:11,248
Thanks, Mr. Mayor.!

1715
01:41:12,658 --> 01:41:14,558
Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.

1716
01:41:14,727 --> 01:41:17,287
Come on!

1717
01:41:17,396 --> 01:41:20,160
- Oh!

1718
01:41:20,265 --> 01:41:22,631
You doing the plumbing
for the whole town now?

1719
01:41:22,735 --> 01:41:24,965
No, I came to see you.

1720
01:41:25,070 --> 01:41:28,528
- Through the drain?
- Just one second.

1721
01:41:31,977 --> 01:41:34,275
Look, Sally...

1722
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:36,610
I was gonna prepare
this whole speech...

1723
01:41:36,715 --> 01:41:39,149
What?

1724
01:41:43,055 --> 01:41:45,455
I was gonna prepare
this whole speech...

1725
01:41:45,557 --> 01:41:48,924
but I think it's better
if I just say this out of the moment.

1726
01:41:49,028 --> 01:41:50,655
All right.

1727
01:41:50,763 --> 01:41:52,754
The truth is, you're beautiful.

1728
01:41:52,865 --> 01:41:55,925
And you're smart and wonderful.

1729
01:41:56,035 --> 01:41:58,196
And...

1730
01:41:58,303 --> 01:42:01,238
And I'm not... I'm not.

1731
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:05,276
- Handy...
- Hang on, 'cause I'm...
I'm in the moment now.

1732
01:42:05,377 --> 01:42:09,438
This whole thing, it's made me take
a pretty hard look at myself.

1733
01:42:09,548 --> 01:42:13,780
And I'm not smart,
a-and I'm not beautiful, but...

1734
01:42:13,886 --> 01:42:18,550
but, hell, I just beat
the most popular president in history.

1735
01:42:18,657 --> 01:42:21,785
So...
Maybe I'm okay.

1736
01:42:21,894 --> 01:42:24,021
Almost.

1737
01:42:24,129 --> 01:42:26,029
You almost beat him.

1738
01:42:26,131 --> 01:42:30,363
Sally, between me and you...
just our little secret... I beat him.

1739
01:42:30,469 --> 01:42:34,428
Do you think I would've voted for myself
after I told the whole town I wouldn't?

1740
01:42:35,541 --> 01:42:37,338
You gave it away?

1741
01:42:38,410 --> 01:42:39,877
Why?

1742
01:42:39,978 --> 01:42:42,310
Because he needs it. I don't.

1743
01:42:42,414 --> 01:42:44,382
L...

1744
01:42:45,584 --> 01:42:47,552
I only need you.

1745
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:51,188
That's...

1746
01:42:51,290 --> 01:42:52,882
That's my speech.

1747
01:42:53,926 --> 01:42:55,894
Oh, Handy.

1748
01:42:57,296 --> 01:42:59,526
Hold on. I got...

1749
01:42:59,631 --> 01:43:01,656
I got you something.

1750
01:43:01,767 --> 01:43:03,291
- Dirt?
- No, it's...

1751
01:43:04,570 --> 01:43:06,731
- It's... It's dirty, but...
- Oh.

1752
01:43:07,773 --> 01:43:09,900
Look, I don't know how you feel...

1753
01:43:18,851 --> 01:43:21,319
- Is that a "yes" kiss?
- Yes.

1754
01:43:23,422 --> 01:43:26,323
It's dirty, but it's...
it's really... it's beautiful.

1755
01:43:26,425 --> 01:43:28,825
- It's beautiful.
- It's, uh, big and...

1756
01:43:28,927 --> 01:43:32,590
That's not just one diamond. There's diamonds
on the side. There's diamonds and mud.

1757
01:43:32,698 --> 01:43:38,034
Oh, did I say in the speech... I forgot
the whole part about how much I love you.

1758
01:43:38,137 --> 01:43:41,038
I didn't say it, but yes... I didn't...
You know, there's no...

1759
01:43:41,140 --> 01:43:44,576
I didn't make a word thing out of it,
but you can't even measure it.

1760
01:43:44,676 --> 01:43:47,577
It's like...
Like, if you take the sun...

1761
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:50,580
You could take the heat
from that sun, and you...

1762
01:43:50,682 --> 01:43:55,619
If you put all of that
in a love container, you'd...

1763
01:43:55,721 --> 01:43:57,245
Got it.

1764
01:43:57,356 --> 01:43:58,914
- Did you get it?
- Yes.

1765
01:43:59,024 --> 01:44:03,017
But you said yes anyway,
so this is all extra, like a bonus.

1766
01:44:03,128 --> 01:44:05,528
- Let's go.
- My heart's beating fast.

1767
01:44:05,631 --> 01:44:07,360
- Plunger, come on!

1768
01:44:07,466 --> 01:44:09,730
- Come on.!
- How'd it get in the sewer?

1769
01:44:09,835 --> 01:44:13,202
- Oh, that's... You know.
Things just happen to me.

1770
01:44:13,305 --> 01:44:16,206
Did I happen to notice
you're wearing a thong?

1771
01:44:16,308 --> 01:44:17,866
- Oh.! Oh.!

1772
01:44:17,976 --> 01:44:20,774
Oh, my God.! Are you okay?

1773
01:44:20,879 --> 01:44:22,744
You did it again.

1774
01:44:22,848 --> 01:44:24,440
I barely touched you.

1775
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:27,451
Okay, look, if this marriage
is gonna work...

1776
01:44:27,553 --> 01:44:30,113
you're gonna have to realize
how strong you are.

1777
01:44:30,222 --> 01:44:32,122
You're stronger than me.
Just accept it.

1778
01:44:32,224 --> 01:44:34,124
- I'm not stronger than you.
- Yes, you are.

1779
01:44:34,226 --> 01:44:36,126
- I'm a girl.
- That's right.

1780
01:44:36,228 --> 01:44:38,662
So it hurts physically and emotionally.
Come on, boys.

1781
01:44:38,764 --> 01:44:40,664
Oh. What about this?

1782
01:44:40,766 --> 01:44:44,167
- Bow on my head.
- A bow on your... In white, I would buy it.

1783
01:44:44,269 --> 01:44:46,897
- No, I'm serious.
- Excuse me, ladies.

1784
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:50,907
- Is Handy around?
- Handy.

1785
01:44:51,009 --> 01:44:52,977
You got company.

1786
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:57,976
Hey. How you doin'?

1787
01:44:58,083 --> 01:44:59,983
Congratulations, Handy.

1788
01:45:00,085 --> 01:45:03,350
You almost beat the most
popular president in history.

1789
01:45:03,455 --> 01:45:07,289
- Oh, well, thank you. No hard feelings, right?
- Are you kidding?

1790
01:45:07,392 --> 01:45:09,292
Let me cut to the chase.

1791
01:45:09,394 --> 01:45:12,124
- What are you doing in about two years?
- What do you mean?

1792
01:45:12,231 --> 01:45:15,098
How does Governor Harrison
sound to you?

1793
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:17,634
Governor?

1794
01:45:18,870 --> 01:45:20,861
No. Thank you.

1795
01:45:20,973 --> 01:45:22,998
We've got a real possibility here.

1796
01:45:23,108 --> 01:45:26,908
Listen, thank you very much.
I appreciate that you're thinking about me.

1797
01:45:27,012 --> 01:45:31,472
But, um, I'm kinda happy
right where I am.

1798
01:45:31,583 --> 01:45:33,517
Well, I'll respect that.

1799
01:45:33,619 --> 01:45:35,280
Okay.

1800
01:45:35,387 --> 01:45:37,378
Have a good day.

1801
01:45:39,891 --> 01:45:41,950
Hey, uh, hold on one second.

1802
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:44,028
Let me just ask you.

1803
01:45:44,129 --> 01:45:46,529
- Can a governor...

1804
01:45:46,632 --> 01:45:48,862
Kinda tell a mayor what to do?

1805
01:45:48,967 --> 01:45:51,595
Oh, yeah.

1806
01:45:52,638 --> 01:45:56,039
- Oww!
