- A plane crashed
in Des Moines Iowa.

12
00:01:33,976 --> 00:01:35,937

hiring, that means jobs!

13
00:02:30,032 --> 00:02:31,659
- Hola, cómo están?

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,910

00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,620
- Bien?
- Yes.

16
00:02:35,496 --> 00:02:36,539
She's doing a thing.

17
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,047
Okay, and I'll have the
pachuga empanalizadas.

18
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:47,884
- Okay.

19
00:02:47,925 --> 00:02:49,886
Flour or corn tortillas?

20
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:52,054
- Uh, flour.

21
00:02:52,096 --> 00:02:54,432
- Chips and salsa?
- Sí.

22
00:02:54,682 --> 00:02:56,142
- Gracias.

23
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,767
- Don't drop the ball on this
thing,

24
00:03:37,808 --> 00:03:41,604
because if it is what I think
it is, it's gonna set us up.

25
00:03:42,897 --> 00:03:44,607
Sweet, new U-Line.

26
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:46,817
We need more shelvage
in the warehouse, stat.

27
00:03:49,987 --> 00:03:50,905
How was it?

28
00:03:50,947 --> 00:03:51,781
- Awesome.

29
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,536
- 2,300 more, with interest.

30
00:03:56,577 --> 00:03:57,912
- Yup.

31
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:03,125
- You ever follow up
with that trampoline guy?

32
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:04,794
- Yeah.

33
00:04:04,794 --> 00:04:06,629
- All right, well don't
let that get away from us.

34
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:07,672
Could be a good one.

35
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:11,968
- Hey, Nana wrote us, man.

36
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:13,219
- Oh yeah? How's she doin'?

37
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:20,643
- My dear boys, I hope all is
going well with your lives.

38
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:22,645
I would say you're moving right
along

39
00:04:22,645 --> 00:04:24,313
and in the right directions.

40
00:04:24,313 --> 00:04:28,568
Life moves on, except now
it is without our Phillip.

41
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:31,862
Last Saturday night he
went out to clean a pool,

42
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:34,782
had a massive heart attack, and
fell in.

43
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:36,993
He never wanted to retire.

44
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:39,287
He wanted to die a working man.

45
00:04:39,328 --> 00:04:41,330
Phil got his wish.

46
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,666
We all should be so blessed.

47
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:48,129
Well dear boys, get yourselves
a hot dog or something,

48
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,257
eat it thinking of me and
I will feel your thanks.

49
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:53,092
Love and hugs, Nana.

50
00:04:54,385 --> 00:04:55,595
- Uncle Phil died?

51
00:04:56,637 --> 00:04:58,180
- He fell in a pool?

52
00:04:58,222 --> 00:04:59,557
- He was a pool cleaner.

53
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,984
- I'll be able to like
3D print myself a new one

54
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:11,027
in like 3 years.

55
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:11,736
- I don't know if
you'd want that, dude.

56
00:05:11,777 --> 00:05:12,612
I couldn't live without my dick.

57
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:14,697
- I mean maybe, but being brain
dead--

58
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:15,531
- Hold on, ask Andy.

59
00:05:15,573 --> 00:05:18,659
- Andy, would you rather have a
lobotomy

60
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:20,036
or get your dick cut off?

61
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:21,871
- A lobotomy?

62
00:05:21,871 --> 00:05:22,913
- See? That's what I
said.

63
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:23,914
- But y'all wouldn't
know what to do with it.

64
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,626
- You don't know what
to do with it anyways.

65
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:27,835
Can I bum a smoke?

66
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:30,129
- Um, yeah.

67
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:32,006
- Yeah!

68
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:33,299
- Hello.

69
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:34,383
Yes.

70
00:05:34,383 --> 00:05:35,843
Yes, ma'am.

71
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:38,721
I will be there ready to go.

72
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:40,056
- Say God bless.

73
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:41,057
- Okay.

74
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:42,725
Okay, God bless.

75
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:44,143
- What the hell was that, dude?

76
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:45,269
- That was the blood
bank telling me I need

77
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,855
to eat a full meal before
my appointment on Tuesday.

78
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:49,649
- Is it for good or for money?

79
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,900
- For money.

80
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,734
- How much?

81
00:05:51,776 --> 00:05:53,069
- Like 30 bucks.

82
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:54,904
We're mostly doing it to
find out our blood type.

83
00:05:54,945 --> 00:05:57,073
Need the blood type to
go to the sperm bank.

84
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:58,115
- How much is that?

85
00:05:58,157 --> 00:05:59,408
- Like $200 a sploosh.

86
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:01,243
- Hey, that's long money, man.

87
00:06:01,285 --> 00:06:02,453
- Yeah!

88
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,872
- You guys have the same blood
type 'cause you're twins?

89
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:06,082
- Same egg, bro.

90
00:06:06,123 --> 00:06:07,958
- You guys have the same penis?

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,918
- Yes.

92
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:10,086
- Hey, did you ever get
that pizza

93
00:06:10,127 --> 00:06:11,045
you were wanting to get, man?

94
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:12,963
- That was yesterday, man.

95
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:13,839
- Oh yeah.

96
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:16,008
Do you still want to get a pizza
though?

97
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:16,842
- I could get a pizza.

98
00:06:16,884 --> 00:06:18,386
- Do you guys want to get a
pizza?

99
00:06:18,427 --> 00:06:19,887
- Nah, I already had pizza
today.

100
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:21,764
- I don't have money for pizza
today, man.

101
00:06:21,764 --> 00:06:24,225
- I think we're gonna go
get a pizza at Pizza Land.

102
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:26,018
- Laters.

103
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,894
- See ya, fellas.

104
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:27,770
- Later.

105
00:06:28,771 --> 00:06:29,939
- So how was it, dude?

106
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,441
- Miguel got paint on
Esteban's favorite CD

107
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:34,193
and then they blamed it on me.

108
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:35,778
I tried to stay out of it

109
00:06:35,778 --> 00:06:38,364
and I think they think
I'm a shitty painter.

110
00:06:38,406 --> 00:06:39,782
- Are you?

111
00:06:39,824 --> 00:06:40,700
- I'm all right.

112
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:43,994
- What did you do all day?

113
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,079
- Man, I hung around here,

114
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:48,249
I took down a few wasps
nests, I ate lunch, pizza.

115
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,460
I did some writing, I
beat off, that's about it.

116
00:06:51,502 --> 00:06:53,212
- Yeah, what'd you do last
night?

117
00:06:53,254 --> 00:06:54,797
- Man, I went to see about this
chick.

118
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,881
- Which one?

119
00:06:55,923 --> 00:06:57,800
- The one I met at the gas
station.

120
00:06:57,842 --> 00:06:59,135
- How was that?

121
00:06:59,135 --> 00:07:00,344
- Weird.

122
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,930
I think I'm just done with this
whole tear I've been on now.

123
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:04,140
- Yeah?

124
00:07:04,181 --> 00:07:07,059
- And I think I'm just done
blowing loads in general too.

125
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:08,811
Maybe like, the emergency ejac

126
00:07:08,853 --> 00:07:11,439
for like maintenance purposes
or to make myself pass out.

127
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,231
- Yeah.

128
00:07:12,273 --> 00:07:13,941
- I gotta keep that shit in,
man.

129
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:15,192
It's good for my work.

130
00:07:16,444 --> 00:07:17,319
- All right.

131
00:07:18,154 --> 00:07:19,113
- Yeah, well.

132
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:21,198
I'm gonna go to the bar.
You want to go?

133
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,116
- I got 20 bucks.

134
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:22,783
- Nice.

135
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:24,827
Should we ask your brother?

136
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:25,494
- No.

137
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,289
No.

138
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,206
- All right!

139
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,207
- Let's go!

140
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:41,469
-Man, if I could do it all over
again,

141
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,721
I think I'd be an OBGYN.

142
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:44,680
- Why?

143
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,347
- Just think about it, dude.

144
00:07:45,347 --> 00:07:46,390
- Like that's an actual job

145
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:49,185
and you're bringing life
into this world every day.

146
00:07:49,226 --> 00:07:50,770
You're like a safecracker.

147
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:52,480
- I mean, you could still do
that.

148
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:57,026
- Nah, it's too late.

149
00:08:09,997 --> 00:08:10,873
- Please don't get a dog.

150
00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:11,540
- Why?

151
00:08:11,582 --> 00:08:12,374
- Please. You don't need one.

152
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,083
- Yes I do.

153
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,043
They'll love me unconditionally.

154
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:16,378
It won't put earplugs in its
ears, dude.

155
00:08:16,378 --> 00:08:17,296
- Yeah, but you can't
take care of yourself.

156
00:08:17,338 --> 00:08:18,380
How are you going to take care
of a dog?

157
00:08:18,422 --> 00:08:19,548
- Oh, good one.

158
00:08:19,548 --> 00:08:20,382
- I'm just saying.

159
00:08:20,382 --> 00:08:22,051
Who are these people in our
spot?

160
00:08:22,092 --> 00:08:23,385
- Hey baby!

161
00:08:23,385 --> 00:08:24,261
How are ya?

162
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,229
I don't think we've met.

163
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:34,146
- Travis.

164
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:35,314
- Remy.

165
00:08:35,356 --> 00:08:36,190
Come, come.

166
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:39,235
This is Rose and...Marlo!

167
00:08:39,276 --> 00:08:40,361
- Rose and Marlo, hello.

168
00:08:40,402 --> 00:08:41,237
I've never seen you girls
before.

169
00:08:41,237 --> 00:08:42,238
You guys come here a lot?

170
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:43,906
We live up the street.

171
00:08:43,948 --> 00:08:44,949
- Us too!

172
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,658
- Awesome,
cheers to being neighbors.

173
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:46,200
- So how you been, man?

174
00:08:46,242 --> 00:08:47,284
What you been up to?

175
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,037
- Not much man, just trying
to figure it all out.

176
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,455
- I hear that.

177
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:52,331
- So what do you do?

178
00:08:52,373 --> 00:08:54,458
- I'm a writer.

179
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,334
- No shit.

180
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:56,502
Like what do you write?

181
00:08:56,544 --> 00:08:58,462
- You know, poetry, short
stories,

182
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,172
I'm also working on a novel.

183
00:09:00,214 --> 00:09:00,881
- No shit!

184
00:09:00,923 --> 00:09:01,757
- What are you doing for money?

185
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:04,093
- I'm just trying to get it
together.

186
00:09:04,134 --> 00:09:06,178
Trying to look for work
actually.

187
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,849
Hey, is that fence dude looking
for people because I could--

188
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,102
- No, no, but I did just get out

189
00:09:13,102 --> 00:09:16,272
of this medical research
facility for the last nine days.

190
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:17,606
Remember how broke I was?

191
00:09:17,648 --> 00:09:19,066
Now I'm flush.

192
00:09:19,108 --> 00:09:20,359
- How much did you make?

193
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:21,318
- Five grand.

194
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,194
- What?

195
00:09:22,236 --> 00:09:23,988
- Yeah, Medico baby.

196
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:25,322
- How do you do it?

197
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:28,534
- Basically, you have to
be like a lab rat.

198
00:09:28,576 --> 00:09:30,452
You take pills, get your blood
drawn,

199
00:09:30,494 --> 00:09:34,999
just sit in this facility
for days and days.

200
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:37,918
- But you just--

201
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,961
- Just show up.

202
00:09:39,003 --> 00:09:40,421
Every morning, 10 a.m.

203
00:09:40,462 --> 00:09:41,881
They do introductions.

204
00:09:41,922 --> 00:09:43,966
- Wow, damn.

205
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:47,261
- You know anybody
renting a room?

206
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:48,137
- Uh, no.

207
00:09:48,178 --> 00:09:49,471
I don't think so.

208
00:09:49,471 --> 00:09:50,598
- I'm sleeping around right now,

209
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,975
I just need to find something
before I take off again.

210
00:09:53,017 --> 00:09:54,268
- Well, I got the RV, man.

211
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,352
- I got money.

212
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:56,228
- It's gonna be hot.

213
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,146
- I got a fan.

214
00:09:58,272 --> 00:09:59,565
- All right, let me ask my
brother.

215
00:09:59,607 --> 00:10:00,399
- My man.

216
00:10:00,441 --> 00:10:02,109
- I think America really hasn't
hit

217
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:03,652
on it right yet, you know?

218
00:10:03,652 --> 00:10:04,486
- Totally.

219
00:10:04,486 --> 00:10:05,905
- And I plan on doing it right,
so,

220
00:10:06,655 --> 00:10:08,449
it's cool, I'm excited to do it.

221
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,408
- Cheers to your novel.

222
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,452
- Yeah, thanks.

223
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,580
- Well ladies, you ready
to get out of here?

224
00:10:15,623 --> 00:10:17,249
- We're gonna hit the bathroom.

225
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,167
- Okay.

226
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,003
- Bye guys, nice to meet
you.

227
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:21,712
- Bye.

228
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,547
See you around the neighborhood.

229
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:24,924
- Yeah, I'll check out
your blog.

230
00:10:24,965 --> 00:10:27,176
- Yeah, do please, definitely.

231
00:10:27,176 --> 00:10:29,011
- Are you still dating, um,
what's her name?

232
00:10:29,053 --> 00:10:30,179
- Don't worry about it.

233
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,472
- Easy baby, easy.

234
00:10:31,513 --> 00:10:32,556
Let me know about that camper.

235
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:33,474
- All right.

236
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,604
- What the hell was that guy?

237
00:10:38,646 --> 00:10:39,521
- That's Remy.

238
00:10:40,397 --> 00:10:42,107
- Remy?

239
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:43,525
He seemed pretty cool.

240
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:45,319
- It's just short for Jeremy
dude.

241
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,280
- Seemed pretty cool to me.

242
00:10:50,574 --> 00:10:52,368
She's still got half a beer,
dude.

243
00:11:10,552 --> 00:11:12,054
- Is that guy really gonna live
in here?

244
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:12,930
- Maybe, man.

245
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,349
- Who is this guy?

246
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:17,226
I gotta know about this guy.

247
00:11:17,267 --> 00:11:19,144
- People say he was raised by
gypsies

248
00:11:19,186 --> 00:11:20,479
in Eastern Europe then they left
him

249
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:22,231
and he taught himself how to
read.

250
00:11:22,272 --> 00:11:22,898
- What?

251
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,400
- Yeah, it's bullshit, man.

252
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,442
- What's he do?

253
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,736
- A whole lot a nothin,
like everybody else, man.

254
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,698
- My kind of dude.

255
00:11:35,077 --> 00:11:37,329
- I gotta get the fuck outta
here dude.

256
00:11:37,371 --> 00:11:38,664
- Yeah? Well where you gonna go?

257
00:11:38,706 --> 00:11:39,748
- Anywhere.

258
00:11:39,748 --> 00:11:42,209
I left home so I wouldn't
become a townie there,

259
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:44,003
I'm not gonna become one here.

260
00:11:44,044 --> 00:11:45,170
No offense.

261
00:11:45,212 --> 00:11:46,755
Ya know, I gotta keep going.

262
00:11:46,755 --> 00:11:49,174
- Yeah, it's the velvet
coffin thing, I get it.

263
00:11:49,216 --> 00:11:51,176
- Yeah, you know it's
a nice place to live,

264
00:11:51,218 --> 00:11:53,178
but I ain't trying to die here.

265
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,015
I'm trying to die a lot farther
away than here, you know?

266
00:11:56,056 --> 00:11:57,641
- Well alright - what are you
gonna do, man?

267
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,768
- I'm gonna fix this RV up and
go,

268
00:11:59,768 --> 00:12:01,520
like me and Haley have been
saying.

269
00:12:01,562 --> 00:12:03,522
She's got money saved up for gas

270
00:12:03,564 --> 00:12:05,607
and once I get this thing going,

271
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:08,318
and I'm gonna, we're out of
here.

272
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:10,070
- Well what are we gonna do
tonight, man?

273
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:11,280
Are we going to that show or
what?

274
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:12,781
- Yeah.

275
00:12:12,781 --> 00:12:14,283
- 'Cause I don't know
if I can drive, dude.

276
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:15,492
- What time is it?

277
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:16,326
- I don't know.

278
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,203
- You wanna take the
train?

279
00:12:18,245 --> 00:12:19,788
- That'll be weird, let's do it.

I think it's pretty awesome.

305
00:14:47,477 --> 00:14:49,521
You got your own styles and
everything.

306
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:53,775
- They can't really talk man.

307
00:14:53,775 --> 00:14:55,652
They're doing this simulation
thing.

308
00:14:56,987 --> 00:14:58,780
and some are actually deaf too.

309
00:15:06,663 --> 00:15:08,248
You want another beer, man?

310
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:09,958
- Yeah, sure.

311
00:15:11,668 --> 00:15:13,295
- Hey, does anyone want a beer?

312
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:19,718
Eight.

313
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,636
Yeah.

314
00:15:29,853 --> 00:15:30,729
Thanks, man.

315
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:35,651
- Alright, man.

316
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:39,571
Stupid car.

317
00:15:39,613 --> 00:15:40,781
- See ya later!

318
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:43,825
- You comin' in?

319
00:15:49,456 --> 00:15:51,416
We could just go to bed.

320
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:16,525
- That party fucking
sucked, man.

321
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:18,568
- Yup.

322
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,654
- And this Trevor guy,
Jesus, what the fuck?

323
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:21,738
Fuck him!

324
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,656
- What?

325
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:27,411
- Did you not, dude, he's
totally
trying to steal your girl.

326
00:16:27,452 --> 00:16:30,038
- No, no, that's how
they communicate, man.

327
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:31,748
They're a very touchy-feely
people.

328
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,750
It's part of the process.

329
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,377
- Did you not just see all that?

330
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:36,878
- He's deaf, dude.

331
00:16:36,878 --> 00:16:38,588
- Yeah well, he's really good
looking.

332
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,548
- So?

333
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:41,341
- And she's like really
into the deaf thing.

334
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:42,175
- I know.

335
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:42,718
- She's like, all about
it.

336
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:44,011
- You just said that!

337
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:53,061
- What are we gonna do?

338
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:54,563
- About what?

339
00:16:54,604 --> 00:16:56,356
- I'm broke.

340
00:16:56,398 --> 00:16:57,274
- You'll be all right.

341
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,233
- No, and the government's not
giving me

342
00:16:58,233 --> 00:16:59,693
any more money until I start
paying back

343
00:16:59,735 --> 00:17:01,028
all these student loans.

344
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:02,863
- Well, didn't you say
that if you didn't finish

345
00:17:02,904 --> 00:17:05,449
that last credit you
wouldn't have to graduate?

346
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,325
- Yeah, fuck it.

347
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:07,576
I just won't graduate.

348
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:10,579
- But doesn't the debt just
keep getting bigger and bigger?

349
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,873
- And how would I go to grad
school?

350
00:17:12,914 --> 00:17:15,292
- You think Fitzgerald
went to grad school?

351
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:19,087
- It's either that or war.

352
00:17:21,048 --> 00:17:21,882
- It's kicked!

353
00:17:21,923 --> 00:17:22,841
- Ah, dude.

354
00:17:27,888 --> 00:17:29,514
- Oh, fuck.

355
00:17:29,556 --> 00:17:31,641
- Oh, there's a hit left in
this, man.

356
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,452
- What the fuck am I
gonna do?

357
00:17:50,494 --> 00:17:51,953
- About what, man?

358
00:17:51,995 --> 00:17:52,913
- I got the school debt

359
00:17:52,954 --> 00:17:56,124
and I gotta pay Ben back like
two grand.

360
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,126
I fuckin' hate living
here with that over me

361
00:17:58,168 --> 00:18:00,629
and him fucking yapping and
shit, man.

362
00:18:03,173 --> 00:18:04,132
- You should just be writing.

363
00:18:04,132 --> 00:18:05,634
You should be focusing on that.

364
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:08,428
You should just write every day.

365
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,137
- Yeah.

366
00:18:09,137 --> 00:18:10,430
- You just don't do it anymore.

367
00:18:10,472 --> 00:18:11,723
Your short stories are good.

368
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:13,767
Your poems are good, man.

369
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:15,977
- What? Which ones?

370
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:19,106
- Like that one, man, about
the lawyers that go to lunch.

371
00:18:19,147 --> 00:18:19,981
- Three Lawyers at Lunch.

372
00:18:20,023 --> 00:18:20,899
- Yeah!

373
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:22,150
- Yeah, I wrote that shit.

374
00:18:22,192 --> 00:18:23,110
- Yeah, it's really good.

375
00:18:23,151 --> 00:18:24,444
And the one about the town

376
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:25,487
that smells like a bathroom

377
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:27,030
and everyone has to drive
through it real fast--

378
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,990
- The Town of a Thousand Urinal
Cakes.

379
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,993
- Yeah, you're really good.
You just don't do it anymore.

380
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:34,454
- I'm just worried about
money right now, all right?

381
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:35,997
- What about the poetry contest,
man?

382
00:18:35,997 --> 00:18:36,998
That's 15 grand.

383
00:18:36,998 --> 00:18:40,001
- Yeah, well I haven't
heard back from them.

384
00:18:40,001 --> 00:18:42,838
Plus that shit goes to
like MFA shitheads in Iowa

385
00:18:42,838 --> 00:18:45,799
or some old lady in New England.

386
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:48,635
People like you and I don't
win that kind of thing man.

387
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:52,514
- What about the Census thing,
man?

388
00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:54,850
That's 18 bucks an
hour - that's good money.

389
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,644
- Yeah, but that's once every
ten years.

390
00:18:57,686 --> 00:18:59,980
- Hey, weren't you gonna be a
notary?

391
00:19:00,021 --> 00:19:00,981
Like I'll do it too, man.

392
00:19:01,022 --> 00:19:02,983
We could put a sign on
the front of the house.

393
00:19:03,024 --> 00:19:04,734
Take this thing, go mobile!

394
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,153
Go town to town signing things,
man.

395
00:19:06,194 --> 00:19:07,821
- You need to know people.

396
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:08,655
- I'm pretty sure you don't.

397
00:19:08,697 --> 00:19:09,531
I'm pretty sure you just go
online--

398
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:10,866
- I'm saying you need to know
people

399
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:12,826
who need shit notarized.

400
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:14,119
Do you?

401
00:19:14,161 --> 00:19:14,995
- No.

402
00:19:15,036 --> 00:19:16,663
- Me neither.

403
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:19,916
- You could do that thing Remy
did.

404
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,543
Be a hamster on a wheel, make
some cash.

405
00:19:21,585 --> 00:19:23,962
- Yeah, maybe I will.

406
00:19:24,004 --> 00:19:25,547
- Yeah, go down there tomorrow.

407
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:28,216
- Yeah, and then Remy
could rent this place out

408
00:19:28,258 --> 00:19:31,052
or my room for like $250,
that's good money man.

409
00:19:31,052 --> 00:19:32,220
- Yeah dude, do it.

410
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,638
- Yeah, I will.

411
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,556
- So go.

412
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:35,474
- Well, yeah.

413
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:40,562
Will you give me a ride?

414
00:19:40,604 --> 00:19:41,730
- Of course.

415
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,565
Maybe I'll do it too.

416
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:45,025
- Alright.

417
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:47,068
- Probably get a lot of writing
done.

418
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,986
- Probably.

419
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:54,784
- Nah man, I'm gonna stick
around here.

420
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,705
I'm really finally getting
to it around here, you know?

421
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:05,670
Someday we'll be so rich, we'll
never die.

422
00:20:10,592 --> 00:20:11,635
- Yeah, well.

423
00:21:04,938 --> 00:21:06,273
- Dude, come on!

424
00:21:06,314 --> 00:21:07,816
- What?

425
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:08,692
What?!

426
00:21:10,151 --> 00:21:11,152
I'm sleeping!

427
00:21:11,194 --> 00:21:12,028
- We gotta go!

428
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,113
- Go where?

429
00:21:13,154 --> 00:21:13,989
What the hell is wrong with you?

430
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:14,823
- To Medico, dude.

431
00:21:14,823 --> 00:21:15,699
I'm late.

432
00:21:16,866 --> 00:21:18,702
- Oh, gross, dude.

433
00:21:19,953 --> 00:21:21,663
- What? It's my snooze booze.

434
00:21:21,663 --> 00:21:23,164
- We gotta go to the place!

435
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,042
- Oh yeah.

436
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,669
- I'll just figure it all out.

437
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,772
- Hey, they got Waffle House up
here, man.

438
00:21:47,814 --> 00:21:48,940
- This is where you turn
in.

439
00:21:48,982 --> 00:21:50,025
- Right here?

440
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:50,942
- Yeah.

441
00:22:00,368 --> 00:22:01,911
How do we get in here?

442
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,913
- I don't know.

443
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:04,789
- Stop, there's a hole.

444
00:22:04,831 --> 00:22:05,665
Stop, stop, stop!

445
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:07,375
I'm getting out.

446
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,378
- Hey, I'll be at that Waffle
House!

447
00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:33,902
- I'm here for the initiation.

448
00:22:33,943 --> 00:22:34,903
- We've already started

449
00:22:34,903 --> 00:22:36,946
and we don't let anyone
in once we've begun.

450
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,740
- I'm only four minutes--

451
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,742
- Yeah, no latecomers.

452
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:41,910
It's our policy, guy.

453
00:22:47,207 --> 00:22:48,416
- You can
come on back tomorrow.

454
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:50,251
We'll get you in if all the
spots aren't filled up, okay?

455
00:22:50,293 --> 00:22:51,795
- Well is there a chance?

456
00:22:51,836 --> 00:22:52,712
- There's a chance.

457
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:54,297
Some people don't pass the
health test.

458
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,131
- And some are late.

459
00:22:57,092 --> 00:22:58,927
- Here, take this
info.

460
00:23:03,098 --> 00:23:03,973
- Thanks.

461
00:23:21,741 --> 00:23:22,742
- Fuck!

462
00:23:23,785 --> 00:23:24,452
Come on!

463
00:23:25,495 --> 00:23:26,371
Fuck!

464
00:23:26,413 --> 00:23:27,789
- You need some help?

465
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:28,456
- What?

466
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:30,375
- Do you need help?

467
00:23:31,292 --> 00:23:33,461
- Do you know how to fix cars?

468
00:23:33,461 --> 00:23:35,463
- No, not really.

469
00:23:35,505 --> 00:23:37,257
- Then why would I need your
help?

470
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:43,847
Ugh.

471
00:24:00,864 --> 00:24:01,906

488
00:26:43,985 --> 00:26:45,486
- Yeah? About what?

489
00:26:45,528 --> 00:26:47,655
- Eh...it's a job.

490
00:26:48,656 --> 00:26:49,490
- A job?

491
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,325
Hang on.

492
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:51,659
Hello?

493
00:26:51,701 --> 00:26:54,370
Yeah, $225.

494
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,956
He didn't even look under
it, fucking jerkoff.

495
00:26:57,665 --> 00:26:59,459
What about that other thing?

496
00:27:00,668 --> 00:27:02,587
All right, that's good, sounds
promising.

497
00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:04,547
Listen, let me go, I got
my brother over here.

498
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:06,215
He's about to lay some shit on
me again,

499
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:07,508
I can see it coming.

500
00:27:07,508 --> 00:27:08,384
Goodnight.

501
00:27:09,344 --> 00:27:11,179
- We got this big deal going
down tomorrow

502
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:14,474
with these coolers, knockoff
Yetis.

503
00:27:14,515 --> 00:27:15,516
Could be a good hit.

504
00:27:16,392 --> 00:27:18,061
So, a job.

505
00:27:18,102 --> 00:27:19,270
What kind of job?

506
00:27:19,312 --> 00:27:21,689
It better not be a weed farm
thing again, I swear to God.

507
00:27:21,689 --> 00:27:25,693
- It's not, it's um, in
pharmaceuticals, so--

508
00:27:25,693 --> 00:27:27,278
- Pharmaceuticals?

509
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,112
Alright.

510
00:27:28,154 --> 00:27:29,989
Well hey, walk with me, talk
with me.

511
00:27:36,704 --> 00:27:37,622
- I only got one.

512
00:27:38,998 --> 00:27:39,666
- It's all right.

513
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:42,085
- So what is it?

514
00:27:42,126 --> 00:27:45,213
- Well, it pays $4,500
for like a week of work.

515
00:27:45,254 --> 00:27:46,130
- Doing what?

516
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:49,050
- I don't know, like testing
pills

517
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,635
and, I don't know, giving blood
and shit--

518
00:27:50,677 --> 00:27:53,012
- Whoa...I heard about this,
man,
you're not doing that.

519
00:27:53,054 --> 00:27:54,055
- Why?

520
00:27:54,097 --> 00:27:55,556
- Because, that's like we
gave this shit to rats,

521
00:27:55,598 --> 00:27:57,058
now we're giving it to
humans kind of shit.

522
00:27:57,058 --> 00:27:58,351
You don't want to do that.

523
00:27:58,393 --> 00:27:59,352
- Yeah, I do!

524
00:27:59,394 --> 00:28:01,646
And that dude Remy has
done it a bunch, man.

525
00:28:01,688 --> 00:28:03,147
- I'm doing it. Tomorrow.

526
00:28:03,189 --> 00:28:04,357
And I'm gonna pay you back!

527
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,066
- Not happening.

528
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:06,651
You're selling me the RV for 15

529
00:28:06,693 --> 00:28:08,403
and giving me six, call it a
day.

530
00:28:08,403 --> 00:28:10,405
- I'm not selling you the
fucking RV, Ben.

531
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:11,239
- It doesn't even run!

532
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,240
- Yes it does!

533
00:28:12,281 --> 00:28:13,116
- It doesn't.

534
00:28:13,157 --> 00:28:13,783
- It will!

535
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:14,492
Same difference, all right.

536
00:28:14,534 --> 00:28:16,160
- "Same difference, all right!"

537
00:28:16,202 --> 00:28:17,036
- Fuck you, man.

538
00:28:17,078 --> 00:28:18,162
- It doesn't run.

539
00:28:18,204 --> 00:28:19,622
- I have to put in a new
carburetor and fix the battery.

540
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:20,999
- Yeah, and I gotta do it for
you.

541
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,666
- Oh, wow!

542
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:23,251
Who cares!

543
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:26,504
- All right, you sell
me the RV for two grand,

544
00:28:26,546 --> 00:28:29,549
I erase your debt, it's a sick
deal.

545
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,384
I sell it to a guy on a deer
lease,

546
00:28:31,426 --> 00:28:33,136
or I rent it to you, you live
back there.

547
00:28:33,177 --> 00:28:34,012
- No!

548
00:28:34,053 --> 00:28:35,388
No fucking way!

549
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,347
- Why not?

550
00:28:36,389 --> 00:28:37,181
- It's the only way I'm gonna
get the fuck

551
00:28:37,223 --> 00:28:38,766
out of here and onto everything
else

552
00:28:38,766 --> 00:28:40,268
I'm ever supposed to do!

553
00:28:40,268 --> 00:28:41,769
- I'd love to know what you've
got to do.

554
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:44,355
What you think you got to do out
there.

555
00:28:44,397 --> 00:28:47,525
I give you a sweet place to
live for 385 bucks a month,

556
00:28:47,567 --> 00:28:49,152
all bills paid, okay?

557
00:28:49,193 --> 00:28:51,279
I let you keep your little
camper back there on the land,

558
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,614
I don't charge you for it,
you're my brother, it's fine.

559
00:28:53,614 --> 00:28:56,284
You eat my food, all the
time, I know you do it,

560
00:28:56,325 --> 00:28:58,453
I buy more because of
you, you little bastard.

561
00:28:58,453 --> 00:29:00,455
I keep fucking toiletries for
you.

562
00:29:00,496 --> 00:29:01,789
You and your little
buddy come in at night,

563
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:03,750
you take my weed, smoke it.

564
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:06,461
I know you do it, you think
I don't notice, I notice!

565
00:29:06,502 --> 00:29:08,087
- Yeah, I'm sure you do.

566
00:29:08,129 --> 00:29:09,338
- What does that mean?

567
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,673
What, like I'm a bad guy?

568
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:11,549
I love that.

569
00:29:11,591 --> 00:29:12,425
I'm the bad guy!

570
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:13,134
- You're not a bad guy.

571
00:29:13,134 --> 00:29:14,719
- That's just human beings, man.

572
00:29:14,761 --> 00:29:16,804
You do, you do, you do
and what do they do?

573
00:29:16,804 --> 00:29:17,889
They resent you.

574
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,475
- I'm just sick of owing
you this fucking money, man.

575
00:29:20,516 --> 00:29:22,060
- What do you want, man?

576
00:29:22,101 --> 00:29:23,311
You want to be like your
little buddy back there,

577
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:26,147
collecting unemployment for
being a waiter for two years?

578
00:29:26,189 --> 00:29:27,315
- No, that's not what I want.

579
00:29:27,315 --> 00:29:28,733
- Dad will slap the shit out of
you.

580
00:29:28,775 --> 00:29:30,651
- That's not what I want.

581
00:29:30,693 --> 00:29:31,486
- I hope not, man.

582
00:29:31,527 --> 00:29:32,737
I didn't set you up here for
that.

583
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:34,739
- And I'm not lazy.

584
00:29:34,781 --> 00:29:37,158
That's why I'm going to this
place.

585
00:29:37,158 --> 00:29:38,493
Alright, so I can pay you back

586
00:29:38,493 --> 00:29:42,163
and finally get going so
I can figure my shit out.

587
00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:50,797
- Beer?

588
00:29:50,838 --> 00:29:52,423
- I can't.

589
00:29:52,465 --> 00:29:53,382
- Why not?

590
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:54,342
- I gotta go in tomorrow

591
00:29:54,383 --> 00:29:56,469
and they said no food or drink
beforehand.

592
00:29:56,511 --> 00:30:00,306
- Cha-ching,
cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching!

593
00:30:00,348 --> 00:30:02,683
- The mediocrity with you is so
thick.

594
00:30:02,725 --> 00:30:05,353
it...it baffles me.

595
00:30:05,394 --> 00:30:07,355
- You don't mean that,
dude.

596
00:30:07,396 --> 00:30:09,774
- Also, that Remy dude is
gonna stay here while I'm gone.

597
00:30:09,816 --> 00:30:10,900
- What? For how much?

598
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:14,195
- $250 to stay in the
RV - that's strong money, man.

599
00:30:15,196 --> 00:30:17,615
- Make it $325, he can stay in
here.

600
00:30:17,657 --> 00:30:18,616
- Alright.

601
00:30:18,658 --> 00:30:20,868
- What? I was gonna try and stay
in the house.

602
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,537
- You're an outside guy, man.

603
00:30:42,515 --> 00:30:45,434
♪ You're gonna die in this room♪

604
00:30:47,728 --> 00:30:51,399
♪ In your twin-size coffin tomb♪

605
00:30:52,692 --> 00:30:56,279
♪ When all your friends have
bailed out ♪

606
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,738
- What is this place?

607
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,282
Is it governmental?

608
00:31:00,283 --> 00:31:01,701
- Probably.

609
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:10,626
- If it sucks or
people are fucking with you

610
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,837
or trying to fuck you,
you're leaving, okay?

611
00:31:13,796 --> 00:31:14,630
- Okay.

612
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:15,506
- I'm serious.

613
00:31:15,548 --> 00:31:16,424
- Alright!

614
00:31:25,975 --> 00:31:27,393
- Later.

615
00:31:27,435 --> 00:31:28,269
- Later.

616
00:31:40,781 --> 00:31:42,283
- Outpatient!

617
00:31:42,283 --> 00:31:43,659
Michael Schlosser.

618
00:31:55,463 --> 00:31:56,923
- Hey, baby.

619
00:31:56,964 --> 00:31:58,424
- What are you doing here?

620
00:31:58,466 --> 00:32:01,928
- My follow-up
blood draw and my check

621
00:32:01,969 --> 00:32:02,637
- Nice.

622
00:32:02,637 --> 00:32:04,847
- Yeah, that's that long money.

623
00:32:05,765 --> 00:32:07,350
What are you doing here?

624
00:32:07,391 --> 00:32:08,059
- Checking in.

625
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,269
- Want me to show you around?

626
00:32:10,311 --> 00:32:11,771
- Are you allowed?

627
00:32:11,812 --> 00:32:12,897
- They love me in here.

628
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:16,484
Denise, I'm gonna give
my little friend here

629
00:32:16,525 --> 00:32:17,610
the nickel tour.

630
00:32:17,652 --> 00:32:18,486
- All right, baby.

631
00:32:18,486 --> 00:32:19,695
- All right, come on!

632
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:34,585
- This is the cafeteria.

633
00:32:34,627 --> 00:32:38,506
Last time, they served this like
barbecue rib sandwich thing

634
00:32:38,547 --> 00:32:40,383
three nights in a row.

635
00:32:40,424 --> 00:32:42,385
People were fucking pissed.

636
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:50,726
- This is the movie room.

637
00:32:51,811 --> 00:32:54,355
They play some pretty
decent stuff sometimes,

638
00:32:54,355 --> 00:32:55,940
usually comedies.

639
00:32:55,982 --> 00:32:57,441
Nothing too exciting.

640
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:02,488
- You can't watch any porn but
it's better than nothing.

641
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,532
This last time, there was
a guy studying for the GRE.

642
00:33:04,532 --> 00:33:06,659
He was taking exams the entire
time.

643
00:33:07,868 --> 00:33:09,370
He was pretty cool.

644
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:14,041
- I suggest you get a top bunk.

645
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:17,503
People fart a lot in
here, especially at night.

646
00:33:17,545 --> 00:33:19,380
I think it's like the meds and
shit.

647
00:33:20,589 --> 00:33:22,550
They don't like you doing
too much physical activity,

648
00:33:22,591 --> 00:33:23,509
but I like to do some push-ups

649
00:33:23,551 --> 00:33:25,720
and sit-ups just to keep it all
together.

650
00:33:26,887 --> 00:33:28,431
Watch your shit.

651
00:33:28,472 --> 00:33:30,016
Some of these dudes are
pre-release from prison,

652
00:33:30,057 --> 00:33:31,934
some of these dudes are
straight up veterans,

653
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:33,644
they've been doing this shit
since 'Nam,

654
00:33:33,686 --> 00:33:35,062
like for the government.

655
00:33:35,104 --> 00:33:37,773
You're not trying to make
any friends in here, man.

656
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,318
It's pretty much bottom
of the barrel here.

657
00:33:41,736 --> 00:33:42,737
But you'll be fine!

658
00:33:42,737 --> 00:33:43,904
Come on.

659
00:33:46,115 --> 00:33:48,617
- And this is the day room slash
rec room,

660
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,870
you can hang out and play games
and shit.

661
00:33:50,911 --> 00:33:53,456
There's this pool table, but
it's
kinda fucked and the sticks
suck.

662
00:33:54,415 --> 00:33:56,083
But...

663
00:34:00,755 --> 00:34:03,799
this, this is the window.

664
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,469
It's good to get your sun.

665
00:34:07,595 --> 00:34:09,555
- Can you go outside at
all?

666
00:34:09,597 --> 00:34:10,431
Ever?

667
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:13,976
- No.

668
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:14,894
Never.

669
00:34:18,647 --> 00:34:20,524
And that, that is the tone of
time.

670
00:34:20,566 --> 00:34:21,776
That is your God.

671
00:34:21,817 --> 00:34:24,862
It's probably your first blood
draw, we should see about it.

672
00:34:24,904 --> 00:34:25,946
Can't be late.

673
00:34:25,946 --> 00:34:27,656
Don't ever be late.

674
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:29,450
- Hey, what's for lunch?

675
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:30,451
- Yeah, when
are we eating, dammit?

676
00:34:30,451 --> 00:34:31,118
I'm starving!

677
00:34:31,118 --> 00:34:31,994
- This is it, man.

678
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:33,954
I'm outta here.

679
00:34:35,414 --> 00:34:36,415
- Thanks, man.

680
00:34:36,457 --> 00:34:37,333
- Good luck, baby.

681
00:34:40,002 --> 00:34:42,546
Hey remember, just do your own
time.

682
00:35:04,485 --> 00:35:05,444
- Oooh.

683
00:35:05,486 --> 00:35:06,404
- You okay?

684
00:35:26,549 --> 00:35:27,842
- One more.

685
00:35:39,186 --> 00:35:40,688
- Treetop.

686
00:35:40,688 --> 00:35:41,522
- Andy.

687
00:35:46,235 --> 00:35:48,112
- Is that fish?

688
00:35:48,154 --> 00:35:50,030
I can't eat fish.

689
00:35:50,072 --> 00:35:50,948
- Why not?

690
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:53,534
- 'Cause they're gross.

691
00:35:53,576 --> 00:35:55,619
I don't want to eat a fish, man.

692
00:35:55,661 --> 00:35:56,787
- You tellin me you're not gonna
eat that?

693
00:35:56,829 --> 00:35:58,706
- No, no way.

694
00:35:58,747 --> 00:36:00,624
- Let me get that then.

695
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:01,500
- Yeah.

696
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:02,209
- All right.

697
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:04,795
- Thank you.

698
00:36:09,049 --> 00:36:10,759
- You're missing out, this is
good.

699
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:11,969
- Oh, I'm sure I am.

700
00:36:14,221 --> 00:36:15,055
- Hey.

701
00:36:16,223 --> 00:36:18,559
- So I know y'all did not
just eat this man's fish?

702
00:36:19,643 --> 00:36:20,936
- Mm-mm.

703
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:21,812
- Nope.

704
00:36:21,854 --> 00:36:22,730
- No.

705
00:36:24,565 --> 00:36:25,566
- Wrong table.

706
00:36:35,242 --> 00:36:38,078
- Okay people, let's listen up.

707
00:36:39,038 --> 00:36:40,748
I bet we're glad to have finally
eaten.

708
00:36:40,748 --> 00:36:41,624
We were hungry?

709
00:36:41,665 --> 00:36:42,917
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

710
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:44,210
- Well good.

711
00:36:44,251 --> 00:36:46,504
I heard there was an
incident with the fish.

712
00:36:46,545 --> 00:36:47,755
I'm not naming names,

713
00:36:47,796 --> 00:36:49,757
but if anything like
that would happen again,

714
00:36:49,798 --> 00:36:51,258
strikes will definitely be
given.

715
00:36:51,258 --> 00:36:54,011
There is to be no sharing of
food.

716
00:36:54,053 --> 00:36:55,179
Do we understand?

717
00:36:55,221 --> 00:36:56,096
- Yeah.

718
00:36:56,138 --> 00:36:57,264
- We're here together for awhile

719
00:36:57,264 --> 00:36:58,432
so let's all get comfortable

720
00:36:58,474 --> 00:37:01,894
and do our work and respect
each other and the process.

721
00:37:01,936 --> 00:37:04,104
In your packets, you will find
all the known side effects

722
00:37:04,104 --> 00:37:05,606
of the drug and you must sign

723
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:07,191
that you understand them
completely.

724
00:37:07,233 --> 00:37:09,818
It's an experimental
medication for syphilis.

725
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,695
The study is to test how the
healthy body

726
00:37:11,737 --> 00:37:12,655
responds to the drug.

727
00:37:12,696 --> 00:37:16,700
Please read your packets
thoroughly and sign.

728
00:37:16,742 --> 00:37:20,120
If you are late for any
meals, you will be docked.

729
00:37:20,162 --> 00:37:22,957
If you are late for any
doses, you will be docked.

730
00:37:22,998 --> 00:37:25,626
If you are late for any
blood draws or ECGs,

731
00:37:25,668 --> 00:37:28,295
you will be docked pay and given
a strike.

732
00:37:28,295 --> 00:37:31,215
Three strikes and you're out,
so watch your time, people.

733
00:37:31,257 --> 00:37:34,176
If for any reason you exit
the study within its duration,

734
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:36,971
you will forego the
$2,500 completion bonus,

735
00:37:36,971 --> 00:37:40,224
you will however retain your
day rate for all days completed.

736
00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:44,603
Your first dose will be in
half an hour, do not be late.

737
00:37:45,854 --> 00:37:47,106
Thank you, people.

738
00:38:23,392 --> 00:38:25,102
- Open your mouth.

739
00:38:26,061 --> 00:38:27,563
Lift your tongue.

740
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:30,107
Now, pull your cheeks like this.

741
00:38:34,153 --> 00:38:35,321
- Good boy.

742
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:04,224
- Hey, anybody ever tell you
you look like the guy

743
00:39:04,266 --> 00:39:05,351
from the show Scrubs?

744
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,227
- No.

745
00:39:07,269 --> 00:39:08,395
- Well you do.

746
00:39:08,437 --> 00:39:09,313
Are you him?

747
00:39:10,397 --> 00:39:11,273
- Nope.

748
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:29,917
- Do you have a beard
trimmer?

749
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:31,752
I gotta get rid of this hospital
beard.

750
00:39:31,794 --> 00:39:32,419
- I do.

751
00:39:32,461 --> 00:39:33,295
- Can I use it?

752
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:34,463
- You can.

753
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:38,133
But I will tell you that I
do use it to shave my pubes.

754
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:39,301
So that's up to you.

755
00:39:40,094 --> 00:39:41,679
- I don't even have one.

756
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,971
- You got a scissor?

757
00:39:43,847 --> 00:39:46,225
- Yo, we're out
of coffee filters, man!

758
00:39:46,266 --> 00:39:47,434
- Use some toilet paper.

759
00:39:47,434 --> 00:39:48,268
- We don't have any of that
either, man.

760
00:39:48,268 --> 00:39:50,229
We've been using the coffee
filters.

761
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:52,272
And I bought both of
those things last time.

762
00:39:52,314 --> 00:39:53,899
- All right, I'll go, dude.

763
00:39:55,234 --> 00:39:56,777
- I'll grab them, don't
worry.

764
00:39:56,777 --> 00:39:57,778
You want to hit this?

765
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,363
- All right.

766
00:39:59,405 --> 00:40:00,614
- What are you so dressed
up for?

767
00:40:00,614 --> 00:40:03,158
- About to go on a date with
this chick I met on Craigslist.

768
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,118
- Oh yeah?

769
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:04,952
- Oh yeah!

770
00:40:04,993 --> 00:40:05,869
- Is she a babe?

771
00:40:05,911 --> 00:40:06,829
- Could be, man.

772
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,747
She's got like piercings
and tattoos and shit

773
00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:09,957
and I'm into it.

774
00:40:09,957 --> 00:40:10,833
- Nice.

775
00:40:13,252 --> 00:40:15,337
- Maybe I'll marry this one.

776
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:20,300
- Man, I really
wish you didn't tell me

777
00:40:20,342 --> 00:40:21,802
about the beard trimmer.

778
00:40:21,802 --> 00:40:22,636
- Why not?

779
00:40:22,636 --> 00:40:24,722
- Well, 'cause I knew it, we
knew it,

780
00:40:24,763 --> 00:40:27,891
and if we hadn't talked about
it, I would have used it.

781
00:40:27,933 --> 00:40:29,143
- Well you can use my brother's,
man,

782
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,978
we don't have to talk about his.

783
00:40:30,978 --> 00:40:32,229
- I just did!

784
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,820
- Morning, gentlemen.

785
00:40:58,338 --> 00:40:59,214
- No man at home.

786
00:41:00,841 --> 00:41:02,009
If you know, it's okay.

787
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,969
You can always come snuggle up
next to Ray.

788
00:41:20,027 --> 00:41:21,028
- You're late.

789
00:41:21,069 --> 00:41:21,695
- Yeah.

790
00:41:21,737 --> 00:41:23,030
- What's your number?

791
00:41:23,864 --> 00:41:26,033
- B-7134.

792
00:41:55,062 --> 00:41:56,855
- Yo Scrubs, you want to shoot
one?

793
00:41:56,897 --> 00:41:59,066
- Nah man, I'm not that good.

794
00:41:59,107 --> 00:42:00,526
- Jesus ain't that good.

795
00:42:00,567 --> 00:42:01,902
- Maybe later, all right?

796
00:42:01,902 --> 00:42:02,945
- Yeah, all right.

797
00:42:02,986 --> 00:42:04,238
You trying to hustle me Scrubs.

798
00:42:04,238 --> 00:42:05,072
- I'll play you!

799
00:42:05,072 --> 00:42:07,157
- Okay everyone, marathon blood
draw

800
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:08,408
starting in 15 minutes.

801
00:42:08,408 --> 00:42:09,910
It'll take about three hours.

802
00:42:09,952 --> 00:42:10,911
Do not be late.

803
00:42:34,101 --> 00:42:36,228
- So, what's your blood type?

804
00:42:39,314 --> 00:42:41,525
- I'm A positive.

805
00:42:42,109 --> 00:42:43,861
- I'm Andy.

806
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,577
- I'm Misty.

807
00:42:57,916 --> 00:42:59,293
What's your blood type?

808
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:03,213
- Uh, A minus, I think.

809
00:43:05,132 --> 00:43:06,383
- You're A positive.

810
00:44:01,521 --> 00:44:02,648
- You want me to talk to her?

811
00:44:02,689 --> 00:44:04,524
- No, no.

812
00:44:05,734 --> 00:44:07,694
- She seems very nice.

813
00:44:07,736 --> 00:44:08,612
- Yeah.

814
00:44:29,216 --> 00:44:32,552
- Alright, would you
guys rather have a lobotomy

815
00:44:32,594 --> 00:44:34,346
or get your dicks cut off?

816
00:44:35,722 --> 00:44:37,349
- Shit, I'd rather blow
my fucking head off

817
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:39,059
than get my dick cut off by some
asshole.

818
00:44:39,101 --> 00:44:39,935
Are you crazy?

819
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:42,187
- Would I have a super evolved
brain?

820
00:44:42,229 --> 00:44:44,064
- Without a dick?

821
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:47,567
- Yeah, yeah probably.

822
00:44:47,567 --> 00:44:49,361
- I need to think about that,
man.

823
00:44:49,403 --> 00:44:52,114
I need to think about that,
that's heavy.

824
00:44:52,155 --> 00:44:53,073
- You're a weird guy, Scrubs.

825
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:40,537
- Hey, that guy probably
had syphilis, man!

826
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:55,427
- Amen.

827
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:16,740
- Hey.

828
00:46:17,824 --> 00:46:19,659
Can I sit with you?

829
00:46:21,787 --> 00:46:22,829
- Okay.

830
00:46:24,498 --> 00:46:25,499
- Okay.

831
00:46:34,841 --> 00:46:37,344
- So do you come here often?

832
00:46:44,226 --> 00:46:45,852
- No, this is my first time.

833
00:46:52,567 --> 00:46:53,693
You?

834
00:46:53,735 --> 00:46:54,653
- Yeah, mine too.

835
00:46:58,573 --> 00:46:59,699
I came for the food.

836
00:47:01,576 --> 00:47:03,370
I'm staying for the money.

837
00:47:03,411 --> 00:47:04,287
- Me too.

838
00:47:05,664 --> 00:47:07,791
- Do you think this is
the guy from yesterday?

839
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:09,584
- That's not funny.

840
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:11,211
- I'm not kidding.

841
00:47:11,253 --> 00:47:12,379
He just disappeared and...

842
00:47:15,757 --> 00:47:16,883
- Are you a vegetarian?

843
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:19,469
- No.

844
00:47:19,511 --> 00:47:21,471
- Well, apparently our bloodline

845
00:47:21,513 --> 00:47:24,599
is really old and our
people only ate like nuts

846
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:26,810
and berries and fruit and stuff,

847
00:47:26,852 --> 00:47:30,564
so we don't have the
proper digestive enzymes

848
00:47:30,605 --> 00:47:32,232
to, you know, digest meat.

849
00:47:32,858 --> 00:47:35,402
- We're kinda like old souls
then?

850
00:47:35,443 --> 00:47:36,736
- Sure.

851
00:47:37,904 --> 00:47:41,533
- So I've been eating the
wrong food every day of my life?

852
00:47:41,575 --> 00:47:42,868
- Are you tired a lot?

853
00:47:42,909 --> 00:47:43,702
- Yeah.

854
00:47:43,743 --> 00:47:45,579
- Feel weighed down all the
time?

855
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:48,206
- Like I have the weight
of the world on me.

856
00:47:48,248 --> 00:47:49,875
- Do you sweat a lot when you
eat meat?

857
00:47:49,916 --> 00:47:51,418
- Yes, meat sweats!

858
00:47:51,459 --> 00:47:52,752
I get em!

859
00:47:52,794 --> 00:47:53,670
- There you go.

860
00:47:58,967 --> 00:48:00,427
This is disgusting.

861
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,811
- So why are you in here?

862
00:48:11,771 --> 00:48:12,898
- For the money?

863
00:48:13,773 --> 00:48:14,941
- I mean you're--

864
00:48:14,941 --> 00:48:15,817
- What?

865
00:48:17,777 --> 00:48:18,612
Pretty?

866
00:48:19,821 --> 00:48:21,448
So?

867
00:48:21,489 --> 00:48:22,574
- I just mean any guy would

868
00:48:22,616 --> 00:48:23,909
be really lucky to take care of
you.

869
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:25,410
- Fuck that!

870
00:48:25,452 --> 00:48:27,662
- Hey, come on, that's not what
I meant.

871
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:29,664
- That's why I'm in this fucking
place.

872
00:48:47,307 --> 00:48:48,308
- Goodnight.

873
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:49,517
- Goodnight.

874
00:49:33,895 --> 00:49:34,938
- You know, there's a part of me

875
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,524
that still says I should go
back and get my PHD.

876
00:49:37,816 --> 00:49:38,817
Ya know?

877
00:49:39,025 --> 00:49:40,777
But I don't know.

878
00:49:40,819 --> 00:49:43,363
With the healthcare game
so volatile right now

879
00:49:43,363 --> 00:49:44,864
I don't know if it makes sense.

880
00:49:44,864 --> 00:49:46,533
I mean, look at this place.

881
00:49:46,533 --> 00:49:47,826
And then there's part of me
again

882
00:49:47,867 --> 00:49:49,911
that wants to go back and be a
golf pro.

883
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:52,580
You know, say I tried it and I
did it.

884
00:49:53,498 --> 00:49:55,583
- Yeah, golf's pretty volatile
stuff.

885
00:50:03,383 --> 00:50:04,968
- What's up?

886
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:06,720
- I just had a bad dream.

887
00:50:08,888 --> 00:50:10,265
- What happened?

888
00:50:11,016 --> 00:50:12,183
- Come on.

889
00:50:12,225 --> 00:50:15,353
Nobody ever really wants to
hear other people's dreams.

890
00:50:16,062 --> 00:50:17,772
- I do.

891
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:19,816
I love dreams.

892
00:50:23,903 --> 00:50:25,655
- Some other time.

893
00:50:44,632 --> 00:50:45,967
- So what do you do?

894
00:50:48,136 --> 00:50:49,054
- About what?

895
00:50:50,513 --> 00:50:51,931
- Everything?

896
00:50:51,973 --> 00:50:54,809
Work, money, work.

897
00:50:58,605 --> 00:50:59,856
- You're looking at it now.

898
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:08,365
- Ugh.

899
00:51:11,618 --> 00:51:13,119
- So what do you do?

900
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:14,579
- About what?

901
00:51:14,621 --> 00:51:16,831
- Money, you know, all of
it?

902
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:18,124
- Well, I don't
want to do any of the things

903
00:51:18,124 --> 00:51:19,584
that I used to do for money.

904
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:22,587
What?

905
00:51:25,465 --> 00:51:26,424
I was a bartender.

906
00:51:29,469 --> 00:51:32,097
And I did...vfoot stuff.

907
00:51:33,139 --> 00:51:34,057
- Okay...

908
00:51:35,558 --> 00:51:36,393
What is that like?

909
00:51:36,434 --> 00:51:37,894
What does that entail?

910
00:51:41,648 --> 00:51:44,109
- Like guys would get a hotel
room

911
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:45,318
or invite me over to their house

912
00:51:45,318 --> 00:51:51,574
and they'd play with my feet
or take pictures of my feet.

913
00:51:58,998 --> 00:51:59,833
- That's weird.

914
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:00,708
- Yeah.

915
00:52:02,627 --> 00:52:05,713
- And sometimes they
would bring these toys

916
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:09,676
or they'd build model towns and
bake cakes

917
00:52:09,676 --> 00:52:13,680
and shit and have me walk all
over them and destroy them

918
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,056
and they'd videotape it.

919
00:52:20,145 --> 00:52:21,938
- How'd you know you wouldn't
get like hurt though?

920
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,857
- It was through a service.

921
00:52:23,857 --> 00:52:26,985
And anyway, my ex would drive me
there

922
00:52:27,026 --> 00:52:28,862
and he'd wait for me and
then he'd take me home.

923
00:52:28,862 --> 00:52:30,196
- Like a pimp?

924
00:52:30,238 --> 00:52:31,114
- No.

925
00:52:34,576 --> 00:52:35,577
- And he didn't care?

926
00:52:35,618 --> 00:52:37,620
- No, in fact he preferred
it to me bartending.

927
00:52:37,662 --> 00:52:38,913
That drove him crazy.

928
00:52:40,748 --> 00:52:42,459
- Well, he sounds like a great
guy.

929
00:52:43,168 --> 00:52:44,043
- Yeah.

930
00:52:48,214 --> 00:52:50,008
- Well what do you want to do?

931
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:52,886
- Well, I write a lot.

932
00:52:53,928 --> 00:52:57,056
And I know everybody says
that, but I actually do.

933
00:52:58,725 --> 00:53:00,185
And I think I'm pretty good.

934
00:53:02,061 --> 00:53:03,897
And I want to travel.

935
00:53:03,897 --> 00:53:04,772
A lot.

936
00:53:07,192 --> 00:53:08,985
And I know everybody says that
too.

937
00:53:16,075 --> 00:53:16,951
What?

938
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,581
- It's just everybody does say
that.

939
00:53:21,581 --> 00:53:22,749
"I want to travel.

940
00:53:22,749 --> 00:53:23,750
I want to travel."

941
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:27,086
I feel like everybody
just does the same shit.

942
00:53:27,128 --> 00:53:30,507
You know, like they go
backpacking through Europe

943
00:53:30,548 --> 00:53:32,217
or they travel to Latin America

944
00:53:32,258 --> 00:53:33,176
and then they come back

945
00:53:33,218 --> 00:53:35,470
and think they're Latin
people or something.

946
00:53:37,263 --> 00:53:38,139
You know?

947
00:53:39,098 --> 00:53:41,726
Or they cheat and carry out
these affairs

948
00:53:41,768 --> 00:53:43,770
just to feel more interesting.

949
00:53:43,811 --> 00:53:46,648
Cause they don't do anything
real at all.

950
00:53:46,689 --> 00:53:49,275
They fuck around and they get
drunk

951
00:53:49,317 --> 00:53:50,902
or they do too many drugs.

952
00:53:50,944 --> 00:53:53,112
Or they try to make a lot of
money

953
00:53:53,112 --> 00:53:57,242
and accumulate wealth like
a bunch of dumb idiots.

954
00:53:57,283 --> 00:53:59,869
And they do it because
they're not good at anything.

955
00:53:59,911 --> 00:54:02,789
So they go on doing
these interesting things

956
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:03,957
and telling everybody about them

957
00:54:03,998 --> 00:54:07,043
as though people actually
care cause they want people

958
00:54:07,085 --> 00:54:08,962
to know about the things they do
more

959
00:54:09,003 --> 00:54:11,548
than they care about actually
doing them.

960
00:54:11,589 --> 00:54:12,715
And it's all the same.

961
00:54:12,757 --> 00:54:18,888
It's just so...desperate,
always, with people. They...

962
00:54:26,187 --> 00:54:27,730
It's just something
I've been thinking about

963
00:54:27,772 --> 00:54:28,815
in here and shit.

964
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:37,073
- You're crazy for thinking
that anything you do

965
00:54:37,115 --> 00:54:39,158
is gonna be some novel thing.

966
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,537
It's just not like that.

967
00:54:44,372 --> 00:54:47,709
- People are alive, Andy, and
they have to do things

968
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:49,919
that they think they should do.

969
00:54:49,961 --> 00:54:52,088
If you don't, you're a dead
person.

970
00:54:55,341 --> 00:54:56,676
And that sucks.

971
00:55:05,184 --> 00:55:08,313
- I want a double-meat,
double-cheese Whopper, man,
fuck!

972
00:55:08,354 --> 00:55:09,939
- Hell yeah, with fries?

973
00:55:09,981 --> 00:55:10,982
- Large fries!

974
00:55:11,024 --> 00:55:12,692
- And a shake!

975
00:55:12,692 --> 00:55:14,319
- I wish I had a pussy to eat
right now!

976
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,321
- That's breakfast, lunch, and
dinner bro!

977
00:55:16,362 --> 00:55:18,156
- After this shit man,

978
00:55:18,197 --> 00:55:20,158
I'm gonna eat all the
fucking pussy in the world.

979
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:22,869
Shit, with this kinda money.

980
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:24,078
Think about it.

981
00:55:27,332 --> 00:55:28,708
- Okay, lights out.

982
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:29,917
Goodnight gentlemen.

983
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:32,086
- Goodnight.

984
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:35,381
- Dios te salve,
Maria, llena eres de gracia

985
00:55:35,381 --> 00:55:39,010
el Señor es contigo. Bendita tú
eres--

986
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,056
- Night Scrubs.

987
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:46,893
- I write too, you know.

988
00:55:48,394 --> 00:55:49,270
- Do you?

989
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:52,815
I haven't seen you write the
entire time you've been in here.

990
00:55:52,857 --> 00:55:57,028
- Yeah, well, I got a
lot going on in here.

991
00:55:59,739 --> 00:56:01,908
- You should write me something.

992
00:56:01,908 --> 00:56:03,242
- What?

993
00:56:03,284 --> 00:56:04,243
Now?

994
00:56:04,285 --> 00:56:05,078
- Yeah.

995
00:56:05,078 --> 00:56:06,204
- Nah...

996
00:56:09,957 --> 00:56:11,834
- Write me a picture.

997
00:56:11,876 --> 00:56:12,919
- A picture?

998
00:56:13,378 --> 00:56:14,754
- A picture of anything.

999
00:56:14,796 --> 00:56:16,089
Whatever you want.

1000
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:21,219
- A picture.

1001
00:56:45,493 --> 00:56:46,452
- Read it.

1002
00:56:46,452 --> 00:56:47,787
- What?

1003
00:56:47,787 --> 00:56:48,663
- Yeah.

1004
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,380
- I'm gonna go home and draw
a picture of two trains.

1005
00:56:57,422 --> 00:57:00,007
One's gonna have pretty eyes.

1006
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:01,384
That one's gonna be you.

1007
00:57:02,802 --> 00:57:05,263
The other is gonna be blue.

1008
00:57:05,304 --> 00:57:07,223
That one's gonna be me.

1009
00:58:06,866 --> 00:58:07,909
- Let's go again.

1010
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:08,785
- Alright.

1011
00:58:08,826 --> 00:58:09,660
- I called winner!

1012
00:58:09,702 --> 00:58:10,745
- Nah, we said best two out of
three.

1013
00:58:13,206 --> 00:58:14,874
- Wake up, man.

1014
00:58:14,916 --> 00:58:16,209
Always sleepin'...

1015
00:58:25,092 --> 00:58:27,553
- I just wanna smoke a fat
bowl and eat tons of shit.

1016
00:58:27,595 --> 00:58:29,138
You know what I mean?

1017
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:31,849
This fuckin' sucks, wake
me when it's bedtime.

1018
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:34,185
- It ain't so bad, man.

1019
00:58:34,227 --> 00:58:36,062
- Yo Scrubs, you want
winner?

1020
00:58:37,063 --> 00:58:37,855
Yo Scrubs!

1021
00:58:37,897 --> 00:58:38,940
- What?

1022
00:58:38,981 --> 00:58:40,274
- You want winner?

1023
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:41,442
- Nah, I'm good.

1024
00:58:45,279 --> 00:58:48,407
- Oh, okay Scrubs, okay, I see
how it is.

1025
00:58:48,449 --> 00:58:49,992
- Man, I will play you!

1026
01:00:02,523 --> 01:00:04,358
- Well look who's late to the
party.

1027
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,276
That's a strike.

1028
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,084
- Get on the bed.

1029
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:31,177
- Shirt off.

1030
01:00:38,517 --> 01:00:40,102
- Now, lay down.

1031
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:53,699
- I told my mama to go get the
gun.

1032
01:00:53,741 --> 01:00:56,452
She was just lying there
on the ground next to him.

1033
01:00:56,494 --> 01:00:58,704
Rocking back and forth, back and
forth,

1034
01:00:58,704 --> 01:01:00,581
all shocked, crying in the
grass.

1035
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:02,083
Couldn't do nothing.

1036
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:05,211
So I had to strangle him to
death,

1037
01:01:05,211 --> 01:01:07,046
'til he stopped his moving.

1038
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:10,049
While my mama she just cried and
cried.

1039
01:01:11,217 --> 01:01:12,051
- Oh my God.

1040
01:01:13,344 --> 01:01:15,721
- And I still miss that dang
cat.

1041
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:18,933
Five, Jimmy.

1042
01:01:30,236 --> 01:01:31,070
- I think the best part is,

1043
01:01:31,112 --> 01:01:32,363
I come  from a small town called
Wynot.

1044
01:01:32,405 --> 01:01:34,073
It's W-Y-N-O-T, if you ever-

1045
01:01:34,573 --> 01:01:35,574
- Goodnight.

1046
01:01:35,616 --> 01:01:37,451
- Hey, can I walk you?

1047
01:01:40,204 --> 01:01:41,497
- Yeah.

1048
01:01:57,596 --> 01:01:58,639
- Shall we?

1049
01:01:58,681 --> 01:01:59,640
- Yeah.

1050
01:02:09,525 --> 01:02:13,988
- Meet me in the movie room
at twenty-four hundred.

1051
01:02:16,282 --> 01:02:17,450
- Goodnight.

1052
01:02:55,529 --> 01:02:56,655
- I'm scared.

1053
01:03:00,242 --> 01:03:01,577
- I think we'll be okay.

1054
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:08,542
I've been thinking a lot
lately about being human.

1055
01:03:11,378 --> 01:03:13,047
- It's a difficult way to live.

1056
01:03:14,757 --> 01:03:16,175
- Yeah, and about how there
really

1057
01:03:16,217 --> 01:03:19,345
isn't any original thing you can
do.

1058
01:03:20,638 --> 01:03:24,225
Yeah, okay, people fall
in love, people travel.

1059
01:03:24,266 --> 01:03:26,435
Or they can live to some
other kind of standard,

1060
01:03:26,477 --> 01:03:28,729
like they could become a
Buddhist monk or something,

1061
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:31,357
but even that's been done to
death.

1062
01:03:31,357 --> 01:03:35,444
That's why, really all there
is to do, is to try and create.

1063
01:03:36,529 --> 01:03:39,698
And I don't mean make babies, or
whatever,

1064
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:40,783
everybody does that too.

1065
01:03:40,825 --> 01:03:45,246
I mean, I mean, you have
to try and make good work.

1066
01:03:46,539 --> 01:03:48,582
Try and make something that's
your own.

1067
01:03:50,167 --> 01:03:50,793
- Personally.

1068
01:03:50,835 --> 01:03:53,129
- Yeah, your own.

1069
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:54,505
Your experiences.

1070
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:01,846
You just gotta make sure your
having the right experiences.

1071
01:04:16,902 --> 01:04:18,195
- Movie time is over.

1072
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,364
Oh, it's Nurse Don.

1073
01:04:20,406 --> 01:04:21,574
Is he gonna give us strikes?

1074
01:04:21,574 --> 01:04:22,408
Yeah, he is.

1075
01:04:22,449 --> 01:04:23,617
Strike, strike.

1076
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:24,827
Come on.

1077
01:04:24,869 --> 01:04:27,663
One more and you're
both out of here, right?

1078
01:04:27,705 --> 01:04:28,747
- Hey, it's my fault.

1079
01:04:28,747 --> 01:04:30,166
- I'm sure it is.

1080
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,417
Goodnight.

1081
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:32,501
Come on, Romeo.

1082
01:05:04,992 --> 01:05:06,702
- So I was thinking...

1083
01:05:06,744 --> 01:05:08,454
- You were thinking?

1084
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:12,458
- We could...

1085
01:07:03,527 --> 01:07:05,988
- What the fuck, man!

1086
01:07:07,781 --> 01:07:08,907
Damnit!

1087
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:33,349
- It's okay, big guy.

1088
01:07:44,068 --> 01:07:45,819
- Good morning,
gentleman.

1089
01:07:54,536 --> 01:07:57,456
- They want our blood again.

1090
01:07:57,498 --> 01:07:58,123
- Okay.

1091
01:07:58,165 --> 01:07:59,041
I'll be right out.

1092
01:08:09,593 --> 01:08:11,512
- That's some good shit, homey.

1093
01:08:11,553 --> 01:08:12,554
Shit.

1094
01:08:14,139 --> 01:08:16,475
Hey, you don't want no
part of this, Scrubs.

1095
01:08:19,812 --> 01:08:20,729
- Hey guys!

1096
01:08:23,607 --> 01:08:25,442
What do we have going on here?

1097
01:08:30,656 --> 01:08:31,698
- Bitchass.

1098
01:08:33,784 --> 01:08:35,619
- It's tropical punch!

1099
01:08:36,829 --> 01:08:38,831
And I'm pretty sure this is
your last strike, huh, guy?

1100
01:08:38,872 --> 01:08:40,707
- Hey, man, chill.

1101
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:41,333
He ain't even hit the
motherfucker, all right?
He didn't even hit the
motherfucker, all right?

1102
01:08:41,375 --> 01:08:42,042
He was just looking at it.

1103
01:08:42,084 --> 01:08:42,918
He ain't never seen one before.

1104
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,838
- Yeah, I ain't ever seen one
before.

1105
01:08:45,838 --> 01:08:47,131
- Right, right.

1106
01:08:47,172 --> 01:08:48,757
You expect me to believe that?

1107
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:51,593
That's all three of you getting
strikes.

1108
01:08:51,635 --> 01:08:53,095
- Hey fool, I said he
didn't hit the motherfucker.

1109
01:08:53,137 --> 01:08:53,971
Alright?

1110
01:08:54,012 --> 01:08:55,848
Look, I'll take the strike, it's
mine.

1111
01:08:55,889 --> 01:08:57,015
You smelling my shit?

1112
01:08:58,058 --> 01:08:59,518
- Yeah, I smell it.

1113
01:09:01,019 --> 01:09:02,146
And you're getting two strikes
for this!

1114
01:09:02,187 --> 01:09:03,188
- That's fine by me!

1115
01:09:09,027 --> 01:09:10,070
- Thanks man.

1116
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:13,907
- That sucks.

1117
01:09:14,658 --> 01:09:16,785
It was like 80 bucks!

1118
01:09:47,065 --> 01:09:49,526
- Wanna go to
the movies again or what?

1119
01:09:50,861 --> 01:09:52,029
- Okay.

1120
01:11:48,687 --> 01:11:49,688
- I'm not...

1121
01:11:52,316 --> 01:11:53,233
- What?

1122
01:11:59,072 --> 01:12:00,157
- Anything.

1123
01:12:05,037 --> 01:12:05,871
Don't.

1124
01:12:33,315 --> 01:12:35,734
- Hold that
there, I'll be right back.

1125
01:13:00,425 --> 01:13:02,761
Okay, one more.

1126
01:13:07,432 --> 01:13:09,184
Huh...Two more.

1127
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:40,382
- That's really nice.

1128
01:13:41,258 --> 01:13:42,300
- Thank you.

1129
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,177
It's come a long way.

1130
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:45,095
It's...

1131
01:13:52,811 --> 01:13:53,478
- Totally.

1132
01:13:55,021 --> 01:13:56,940
- I do them all over the
country.

1133
01:13:58,024 --> 01:13:59,860
It's a landscape.

1134
01:13:59,901 --> 01:14:01,945
I do ones outside too.

1135
01:14:01,987 --> 01:14:03,488
I do all kinds.

1136
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:06,324
- That's nice.

1137
01:15:03,381 --> 01:15:04,216
- Go to her.

1138
01:15:04,216 --> 01:15:05,217
- Hey, fuck that!

1139
01:15:06,593 --> 01:15:08,220
Hey, man, you look like shit.

1140
01:15:08,261 --> 01:15:09,888
- I feel like shit, man!

1141
01:15:09,888 --> 01:15:12,808
It's this fuckin' medicine
and the air in here, man.

1142
01:15:12,849 --> 01:15:14,392
I can't fuckin' breathe it
anymore.

1143
01:15:14,434 --> 01:15:16,436
I need to go outside or
something, man.

1144
01:15:16,478 --> 01:15:18,814
- Well listen, you can't act
sick in here.

1145
01:15:19,439 --> 01:15:20,899
If the screws find out,

1146
01:15:20,899 --> 01:15:22,150
they gonna kick you out of the
program

1147
01:15:22,192 --> 01:15:24,319
and you're gonna lose that money
you been working so hard for.

1148
01:15:24,361 --> 01:15:26,071
You smellin' my shit?

1149
01:15:26,112 --> 01:15:26,905
- What do I do?

1150
01:15:26,905 --> 01:15:29,032
- Keep your fuckin' mouth
closed.

1151
01:15:29,074 --> 01:15:29,908
Put on a good face.

1152
01:15:29,908 --> 01:15:31,243
Go get cleaned up.

1153
01:15:31,243 --> 01:15:34,246
Look we got one day left
in this shit and that's it.

1154
01:15:34,287 --> 01:15:36,081
So eat your fucking breakfast,
man.

1155
01:16:31,636 --> 01:16:33,054
- Drink it all.

1156
01:16:34,306 --> 01:16:36,558
Make sure you get some more.

1157
01:16:58,455 --> 01:17:01,333
- Ladies and gentlemen, it is
almost time

1158
01:17:01,333 --> 01:17:03,668
for your final dose.

1159
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:05,170
You did it.

1160
01:17:05,462 --> 01:17:06,504
Congratulations.

1161
01:17:36,076 --> 01:17:37,953
- Ain't my fault your wife
went and got pregnant.

1162
01:17:37,994 --> 01:17:39,371
I'm going to Myrtle.

1163
01:17:39,412 --> 01:17:40,538
The Masters, baby!

1164
01:19:02,328 --> 01:19:04,289
- The hell are you doing in
here?

1165
01:19:06,291 --> 01:19:07,500
You're sick, man.

1166
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:08,334
I'm tellin'.

1167
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:10,295
- I wouldn't do that if I were
you.

1168
01:19:10,336 --> 01:19:11,796
I saw you, you fuckin perv.

1169
01:19:11,838 --> 01:19:12,672
- Saw what?

1170
01:19:12,714 --> 01:19:14,174
- What you just did.

1171
01:19:14,215 --> 01:19:15,175
In here.

1172
01:19:15,216 --> 01:19:15,800
- Who cares?

1173
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,260
- I care.

1174
01:19:17,302 --> 01:19:18,261
- Bro.

1175
01:19:18,303 --> 01:19:21,139
- Don't you dare fucking
'bro' me man, or else.

1176
01:19:22,515 --> 01:19:23,433
- Excuse me?

1177
01:19:24,809 --> 01:19:25,852
Or else what?

1178
01:19:25,894 --> 01:19:29,189
- Or else this isn't gonna
look to pretty for you.

1179
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:30,815
And this whole weird place.

1180
01:19:30,857 --> 01:19:34,319
I don't think it needs any bad
light shining on it, do you?

1181
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:36,237
- What do you want?

1182
01:19:36,279 --> 01:19:37,822
- Erase all our strikes.

1183
01:19:37,822 --> 01:19:40,325
Mine, hers, and all the guys.

1184
01:19:40,366 --> 01:19:43,495
And see to it that none of
our wages get docked at all.

1185
01:19:44,704 --> 01:19:47,082
Got it, bro?

1186
01:19:51,503 --> 01:19:53,713
And clean this shit up.

1187
01:19:53,755 --> 01:19:54,839

1214
01:22:04,636 --> 01:22:05,678
- And good luck out there, man.

1215
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,347
In all this shit.

1216
01:22:07,388 --> 01:22:09,307
- Thanks, you too.

1217
01:22:09,307 --> 01:22:10,391
- Alright.

1218
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:18,733
- No.

1219
01:22:18,775 --> 01:22:19,651
Don't do that!

1220
01:22:20,485 --> 01:22:21,694
- Chester!

1221
01:22:22,278 --> 01:22:23,738
- No don't, please!

1222
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:24,614
- Chester!

1223
01:22:24,656 --> 01:22:25,907
Hey! Hey.

1224
01:22:27,033 --> 01:22:28,493
It's all over.

1225
01:22:33,915 --> 01:22:35,333
- Hey Andy.

1226
01:22:37,669 --> 01:22:39,462
I'd get my dick cut off, man.

1227
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:43,424
I need this shit.

1228
01:22:44,509 --> 01:22:45,718
Everybody else will be walking
around

1229
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,470
like zombies with their dicks
still on.

1230
01:22:47,512 --> 01:22:50,390
But I'll be running shit.

1231
01:22:52,850 --> 01:22:53,935
- Alright.

1232
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:20,378
Has a girl named Misty
checked out of here already?

1233
01:23:20,378 --> 01:23:21,421
- Misty?

1234
01:23:25,550 --> 01:23:29,846
I don't have a record of
a Misty with us at all.

1235
01:23:31,055 --> 01:23:32,724
- What?

1236
01:23:32,765 --> 01:23:33,891
Are you sure?

1237
01:23:35,018 --> 01:23:35,893
- I'm sure.

1238
01:23:36,978 --> 01:23:37,854
Nope.

1239
01:24:24,442 --> 01:24:25,943
- Hey, little buddy.

1240
01:24:41,125 --> 01:24:43,836
A guy owed me a favor and I took
it.

1241
01:24:43,878 --> 01:24:46,464
It was the carburetor - I was
right.

1242
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:47,632
- Thanks.

1243
01:25:32,009 --> 01:25:33,136
- Hey, bud.

1244
01:25:34,887 --> 01:25:36,097
Good to see ya.

1245
01:25:41,894 --> 01:25:43,855
You movin' back in there?

1246
01:25:45,148 --> 01:25:46,899
- Nope.

1247
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:06,544
- Hey, I got this power
I ran you from the house.

1248
01:26:06,544 --> 01:26:07,545
Where are the holes?

1249
01:26:07,545 --> 01:26:09,881
- There's a thing, it's right
around there.

1250
01:26:21,934 --> 01:26:23,728
- Alright, you're all set.

1251
01:26:25,271 --> 01:26:26,856
- Thanks, man.

1252
01:26:26,898 --> 01:26:28,065
- You hungry?

1253
01:26:28,065 --> 01:26:29,233
- No, not really.

1254
01:26:29,233 --> 01:26:30,902
I think I'm gonna take a nap.

1255
01:26:30,902 --> 01:26:31,819
- Alright, well,

1256
01:26:31,861 --> 01:26:33,988

anything, alright?

1257
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:47,251
- Hey man, let's go to this

1258
01:26:47,251 --> 01:26:48,461
It's gonna be huge.

1259
01:26:50,922 --> 01:26:53,925
- Nah man, I'm
not trying to do that.

1260
01:26:53,925 --> 01:26:56,844
- Come on man, we'll find some
chicks, get em to love us.

1261
01:26:57,845 --> 01:26:59,263
- I got one foot out the door,
man,

1262
01:26:59,263 --> 01:27:02,183
I'm just trying to mind my
own business, alright?

1263
01:27:02,225 --> 01:27:03,643
- What do you mean?

1264
01:27:04,227 --> 01:27:05,811
- I mean I'm not
trying to see people.

1265
01:27:05,853 --> 01:27:06,979
I'm leaving, alright?

1266
01:27:07,021 --> 01:27:09,190
Just go by yourself, dude.

1267
01:27:12,193 --> 01:27:14,070
- I don't wanna go by myself,
man.

1268
01:27:15,863 --> 01:27:18,866
Hey, you got third place

place?

01:27:24,121 --> 01:27:25,289
- Nothin'.

01:27:26,249 --> 01:27:27,208

1285
01:27:52,942 --> 01:27:55,236
- I mean I chill, I write,
I do a little this and that.

1286
01:27:55,278 --> 01:27:57,238
- Oh yeah? What kind of writing
- You're a writer?

1287
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:01,325
- Yeah, I mean, you know, I
don't like to
talk about it much, but--

1288
01:28:10,001 --> 01:28:15,006
♪ I want to buy a condo downtown♪

1289
01:28:16,841 --> 01:28:20,928
♪ I want to buy a condo downtown♪

1290
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:27,184

01:28:27,184 --> 01:28:28,686
but I'm gonna miss you.

1292
01:28:28,728 --> 01:28:29,687

1293
01:28:29,729 --> 01:28:31,606
We hung out like every day.

1294
01:28:32,857 --> 01:28:33,524

You'll be all right.

They want to see more of your

1300
01:28:43,284 --> 01:28:45,703
I haven't gotten third place in
anything.

1301
01:28:46,203 --> 01:28:48,706
- Well do you submit your stuff
to places?

1302
01:28:49,707 --> 01:28:50,750
- No.

1303
01:28:50,791 --> 01:28:52,835

1304
01:28:52,877 --> 01:28:55,004
- Nah, I gotta get better first,
man.

1305
01:28:55,046 --> 01:28:57,298
I think I'm gonna go to grad
school.

1306
01:28:57,340 --> 01:28:59,717
I'm gonna get that
financial aid going again

1307
01:28:59,759 --> 01:29:01,135
and, depending on the MFA
program,

1308
01:29:01,177 --> 01:29:02,928
that's like another three years.

1309
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:04,889
You know, I just gotta take the
G.E.D.

1310
01:29:06,057 --> 01:29:08,392
- I think you mean G.R.E., man.

1311
01:29:08,392 --> 01:29:10,936
- Yeah, right, whatever, G.R.E.

1312
01:29:10,978 --> 01:29:12,897
- You ever heard of a J-O-B,
bro?

1313
01:29:15,191 --> 01:29:16,233

From the party?

1315
01:29:25,701 --> 01:29:27,745
- What the hell, man, when
did you learn to speak sign?

1316
01:29:27,787 --> 01:29:30,164
- Dude, my Aunt's deaf.

1317
01:29:30,748 --> 01:29:32,083
Second language.

1318
01:29:32,124 --> 01:29:33,417
- My number one hire.

1319
01:29:34,293 --> 01:29:36,879
I never stop learning new
things about this guy.

1320
01:29:36,921 --> 01:29:37,963

- Alright, I'm gonna stick
around, dude.

1328
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,906
I think this chick over
here is feeling on me.

1329
01:30:03,948 --> 01:30:05,116
- Which one?

1330
01:30:05,116 --> 01:30:08,411
- The one with the half shaved
head and the neck tattoo.

1331
01:30:09,286 --> 01:30:10,121
- All right, do you.

1332
01:30:10,121 --> 01:30:10,996
I gotta go.

1333
01:30:11,497 --> 01:30:13,290

- Oh, thank you, man.

1338
01:31:03,466 --> 01:31:05,259
- Scumbag.

1339
01:31:40,544 --> 01:31:41,837
- What?

1340
01:31:41,879 --> 01:31:43,547
- Did you just throw up in that
cactus?

1341
01:31:43,589 --> 01:31:44,799
- No.

1342
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:45,508
Why?

1343
01:31:46,342 --> 01:31:48,469
What are you doing, are you
crying?

1344
01:31:48,511 --> 01:31:49,386
- No.

I'll give you a ride.

Thank you.

1349
01:31:54,141 --> 01:31:54,809

- What?

1351
01:31:55,392 --> 01:31:57,311
- Please, just let me.

1352
01:32:10,574 --> 01:32:11,408
- Hey.

1353
01:32:11,450 --> 01:32:12,910
Hey.

1354
01:32:12,910 --> 01:32:14,912
Hey, listen.

1355
01:32:14,912 --> 01:32:15,788
Hey.

1356
01:32:18,958 --> 01:32:21,252
Look you're not deaf, okay?

1357
01:32:22,211 --> 01:32:23,295
You're not.

1358
01:32:23,337 --> 01:32:24,421
You're just not deaf.

1359
01:32:24,463 --> 01:32:25,923
It's okay.

1360
01:32:25,965 --> 01:32:28,050
You're probably never gonna be
deaf.

1361
01:32:29,093 --> 01:32:30,427
You're gonna be all right.

1362
01:32:32,596 --> 01:32:34,557
You're gonna move past all of
this.

1363
01:32:34,598 --> 01:32:35,516
And me.

1364
01:32:37,351 --> 01:32:39,311
I mean, you're gonna do better
than me.

1365
01:32:40,187 --> 01:32:41,480
Not to me, but to you.

1366
01:32:41,522 --> 01:32:43,315
And people like you.

1367
01:32:44,441 --> 01:32:46,193

01:38:14,771 --> 01:38:16,773
I gotta do some more
organizing around here.

1400
01:38:54,019 --> 01:38:55,687
- Go away.

1401
01:38:55,729 --> 01:38:56,980

01:38:56,980 --> 01:38:57,981

01:38:57,981 --> 01:39:00,692
I'm leaving tomorrow.
So just go, all right?

1404
01:39:00,734 --> 01:39:02,361
- I'm leaving tomorrow
too.

1405
01:39:02,402 --> 01:39:03,820
- Cool, well, you can leave now.

1406
01:39:03,820 --> 01:39:04,821
Thanks, see ya!

1407
01:39:06,615 --> 01:39:07,616
- Can I please come in?

1408
01:39:07,658 --> 01:39:08,325
- No!

1409
01:39:08,367 --> 01:39:09,451
- Why not?

1410
01:39:10,410 --> 01:39:11,954
- Cause I don't need
the emotional overhead

1411
01:39:11,995 --> 01:39:13,664
of all of that right now.

1412
01:39:13,664 --> 01:39:14,498
- Of what?

1413
01:39:14,539 --> 01:39:15,916
- Of you, all right?

1414
01:39:15,958 --> 01:39:17,417
Of all of this.

1415
01:39:17,459 --> 01:39:19,503
I need me and this RV.

1416
01:39:19,503 --> 01:39:20,587
That's it.

1417
01:39:20,629 --> 01:39:22,881
And maybe a dog that we
find somewhere along the way

1418
01:39:22,923 --> 01:39:23,715
to love us.

1419
01:39:23,757 --> 01:39:24,758
- Andy.

1420
01:39:26,510 --> 01:39:28,345
- Of all the beds you
could have ended up in

1421
01:39:28,345 --> 01:39:30,722
in this town, you had to end up
in mine.

1422
01:39:31,848 --> 01:39:33,600
- Look, I'm just glad that I
found you.

1423
01:39:33,642 --> 01:39:34,518
Aren't you?

1424
01:39:37,729 --> 01:39:40,649
- Look, I went back with my
boyfriend,

1425
01:39:40,691 --> 01:39:44,027
my ex-boyfriend, and it
was a huge mistake, okay?

1426
01:39:44,027 --> 01:39:45,070
So I fled.

1427
01:39:45,112 --> 01:39:48,365
And then I met him out and
we just started talking

1428
01:39:48,365 --> 01:39:51,410
and he was being really
nice and I was exhausted.

1429
01:39:51,451 --> 01:39:53,328
So yes, I went home with him.

1430
01:39:53,370 --> 01:39:54,496
I did.

1431
01:39:54,538 --> 01:39:55,956
I did that.

1432
01:40:02,004 --> 01:40:03,880
Look, I'm leaving tomorrow.

1433
01:40:05,590 --> 01:40:06,717
Where are you going?

1434
01:40:07,801 --> 01:40:08,593
- I don't know.

1435
01:40:08,635 --> 01:40:10,429
Anywhere that's not fucking
here.

1436
01:40:13,432 --> 01:40:14,975
- Can I please come in?

1437
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:19,021
I won't hurt you or anything.

1438
01:40:20,897 --> 01:40:22,733
- Yeah, okay, Misty.

1439
01:40:23,775 --> 01:40:24,693
Oh wait.

1440
01:40:24,735 --> 01:40:26,737
That's not your real name.

1441
01:40:26,778 --> 01:40:28,780
You gave me some fake stripper
name

1442
01:40:28,822 --> 01:40:32,492
or something like the whole
thing was a fake thing for you.

1443
01:40:32,534 --> 01:40:33,452
- No, no, no it wasn't.

1444
01:40:33,493 --> 01:40:34,453
It was real.

1445
01:40:34,494 --> 01:40:36,079
That's why.

1446
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:38,290
That's why I got scared.

1447
01:40:39,124 --> 01:40:41,418
And because I didn't want to let
you down.

1448
01:40:48,759 --> 01:40:49,676
- I'm Sarah.

1449
01:40:52,971 --> 01:40:54,097
- Sarah?

1450
01:40:55,515 --> 01:40:56,516
- Yeah, Sarah.

1451
01:40:58,518 --> 01:40:59,394
What?

1452
01:41:00,604 --> 01:41:03,899
What? That doesn't fit your
whole weird idealization of me?

1453
01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:04,983
You can't do that.

1454
01:41:05,025 --> 01:41:05,567
- Do what?

1455
01:41:05,609 --> 01:41:07,444
- Idealize me like that.

1456
01:41:07,444 --> 01:41:08,487
Like you did.

1457
01:41:08,528 --> 01:41:09,446
- I can't help it.

1458
01:41:09,446 --> 01:41:12,115
- Well, it isn't fair.

1459
01:41:12,157 --> 01:41:15,869
It's like I'm this
sacred, virgin lovething,

1460
01:41:15,911 --> 01:41:18,080
or something, that I'm not.

1461
01:41:18,121 --> 01:41:20,624
I will never live up to it,
Andy,

1462
01:41:20,624 --> 01:41:25,003
cause I'm just a person,
like you, who likes you.

1463
01:41:32,844 --> 01:41:36,640
And I loved your poem, so much.

1464
01:41:40,102 --> 01:41:41,144
And your blood.

1465
01:41:44,147 --> 01:41:45,899
And, not like this matters,

1466
01:41:45,941 --> 01:41:46,983
because I'm not your girlfriend

1467
01:41:46,983 --> 01:41:49,027
and you don't have any
claim over me or anything,

1468
01:41:49,069 --> 01:41:50,821
but nothing happened with him.

1469
01:41:52,155 --> 01:41:53,156
- What?

1470
01:41:53,156 --> 01:41:56,576
- He just cried a lot and--

1471
01:41:58,203 --> 01:41:59,162
and I cried too.

1472
01:41:59,204 --> 01:42:00,997
And we -- I don't know, we just
cried together

1473
01:42:01,039 --> 01:42:02,582
until we fell asleep.

1474
01:42:06,169 --> 01:42:07,629
And so what if I fucked him?

1475
01:42:07,671 --> 01:42:09,423
I've fucked a lot of guys!

1476
01:42:11,716 --> 01:42:13,176
Can I please come in?

1477
01:42:13,885 --> 01:42:15,178
- What's the point?

1478
01:42:16,179 --> 01:42:17,180
- 'Cause I heard about this
thing

1479
01:42:17,222 --> 01:42:18,849
and we should go do it,
together.

1480
01:42:19,933 --> 01:42:21,017
- What thing?

1481
01:42:22,018 --> 01:42:25,730
- It's a sleep study in Paris.

1482
01:42:25,772 --> 01:42:28,817
And they just want to monitor
our dreams.

1483
01:42:28,859 --> 01:42:30,193
And our brain activity.

1484
01:42:31,194 --> 01:42:32,737
It's 10 grand!

1485
01:42:32,779 --> 01:42:33,780
Per person.

1486
01:42:33,822 --> 01:42:35,157
For two weeks.

1487
01:42:35,198 --> 01:42:37,200
And they fly you out there

1488
01:42:37,242 --> 01:42:38,952
and you could stay up to like a
month

1489
01:42:38,994 --> 01:42:39,953
before they fly you back.

1490
01:42:39,995 --> 01:42:41,538
And they want couples.

1491
01:42:41,538 --> 01:42:44,791
And I don't know, maybe
it will work between us,

1492
01:42:44,833 --> 01:42:48,879
maybe it won't, but at
least we'll get to see

1493
01:42:48,879 --> 01:42:51,465
about each other and see some of
the world

1494
01:42:51,506 --> 01:42:55,010
and it'll be an adventure.

1495
01:42:56,219 --> 01:42:58,889
We just gotta get to Florida.

1496
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:05,604
I like you.

1497
01:43:06,938 --> 01:43:08,899
And I want to go on an adventure

1498
01:43:08,940 --> 01:43:10,567
with you.

1499
01:43:16,031 --> 01:43:17,908
So what do you say?

1500
01:43:19,951 --> 01:43:21,536
Can I come in?

1501
01:43:22,078 --> 01:43:23,914
Or what?

1502
01:43:31,838 --> 01:43:33,673
- What's that? My money?

1503
01:43:33,715 --> 01:43:34,841
- Yeah.

1504
01:43:34,883 --> 01:43:36,176
- Keep it.

1505
01:43:36,218 --> 01:43:37,177
- Really?

1506
01:43:37,761 --> 01:43:39,137
- Ah, gimme half.

1507
01:43:39,179 --> 01:43:40,013
- Really?

1508
01:43:40,055 --> 01:43:40,764
- No, man.

1509
01:43:40,764 --> 01:43:41,598
Definitely not.

1510
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:42,807
It's the real world. Gimme my
money.

1511
01:43:45,018 --> 01:43:46,102
And what's up with her car over
there?

1512
01:43:46,102 --> 01:43:48,855
Is it going to sit there
the rest of my life or what?

1513
01:43:48,897 --> 01:43:50,273
- I don't know.

1514
01:43:50,273 --> 01:43:51,983
- I'll give ya $250 for
it.

1515
01:43:53,652 --> 01:43:54,986
- What do you think?

1516
01:43:55,028 --> 01:43:55,862
- About what?

1517
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:56,530
- About the car?

1518
01:43:56,571 --> 01:43:57,989
I'll give you three for it.

1519
01:43:58,031 --> 01:43:58,782
- Three what?

1520
01:43:58,782 --> 01:43:59,908
- $300.

1521
01:43:59,950 --> 01:44:00,867
- For my car?

1522
01:44:00,909 --> 01:44:01,785
- Yeah.

1523
01:44:02,869 --> 01:44:03,995
- It's all yours, man.

1524
01:44:06,831 --> 01:44:08,792
- Make it four and we'll call it
a day.

1525
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:11,628
- Deal.

1526
01:44:21,638 --> 01:44:22,514
Here.

1527
01:44:24,891 --> 01:44:27,310
For some food and gas and
stuff for you and her,

1528
01:44:27,352 --> 01:44:28,645
you're gonna need it.

1529
01:44:29,229 --> 01:44:30,063
- Really?

1530
01:44:30,105 --> 01:44:30,981
- Yeah.

1531
01:44:31,815 --> 01:44:33,942
'Cause you came through on that
too.

1532
01:44:33,984 --> 01:44:35,026
And I like ya.

1533
01:44:36,027 --> 01:44:37,737
- I love you too, man.

1534
01:44:39,155 --> 01:44:40,156
- You're a good boy.

1535
01:44:40,198 --> 01:44:41,908
She seems all right.

1536
01:44:41,950 --> 01:44:43,076
Be careful.

1537
01:44:45,203 --> 01:44:46,037
- Alright.

1538
01:44:46,079 --> 01:44:47,289
- Later, man.

1539
01:44:47,330 --> 01:44:48,707
- Later.

1540
01:44:52,711 --> 01:44:56,006
- Don't be takin any wooden
nickels
out there while you're sellin'
your soul.

1541
01:44:56,047 --> 01:44:56,965
- I won't.

1542
01:44:58,174 --> 01:44:59,593
- Oooh, yeah.

1543
01:45:01,678 --> 01:45:02,887
- Ah.

1544
01:45:02,929 --> 01:45:03,805
- God.

1545
01:45:06,099 --> 01:45:08,059
Y'all be good, alright?

1546
01:45:08,101 --> 01:45:09,185
- We will.

1547
01:45:13,857 --> 01:45:15,108
- Bye guys.

1548
01:45:18,069 --> 01:45:19,279
- Hang on, Andy.

1549
01:45:24,909 --> 01:45:26,661
Hey man, you let me know when
you get

1550
01:45:26,703 --> 01:45:28,330
wherever the hell you're going,
alright?

1551
01:45:29,205 --> 01:45:30,665
- I will, man.

1552
01:45:35,378 --> 01:45:36,588
Later.

1553
01:45:37,255 --> 01:45:38,840
- Later.

1554
01:46:23,301 --> 01:46:24,761
- Here we go.
