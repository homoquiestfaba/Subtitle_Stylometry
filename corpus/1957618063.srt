[tires squeal]

8
00:00:34,137 --> 00:00:34,965
- Oh, boy.

9
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:37,934
- Woo!

10
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:40,557
[Chad chuckles]

11
00:00:41,903 --> 00:00:44,251
- Come on, Monty, step on it!

12
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:45,045
- Ralphie!

13
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:52,362
[tires squeal]

14
00:00:54,226 --> 00:00:57,471
- Why won't you guys
 just leave me alone?

15
00:00:57,471 --> 00:01:00,025
[tires squeal]

16
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,752
- Go, Monty!

17
00:01:02,752 --> 00:01:03,580
Woo!

18
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,656
[tires squeal]

19
00:01:14,557 --> 00:01:15,385
Yeah!

20
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:18,975
- Woo!

21
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:22,599
- Don't.

22
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:32,506
- Come on, Ralphie
 boy. [chuckles]

23
00:01:32,506 --> 00:01:33,334
- Yeah!

24
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:39,961
Whoa!

25
00:01:40,928 --> 00:01:43,482
[Lance laughs]

26
00:01:55,253 --> 00:01:57,738
[birds chirp]

[tires squeal]

28
00:02:08,852 --> 00:02:13,098
- Hey, come here, little
 Ralph, come here, Ralphie.

29
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:25,697
Come here!

30
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:45,993
- You're dead, Ralph!

31
00:02:57,246 --> 00:03:00,145
[breathes heavily]

32
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,531
- Why don't you
 guys pick on someone

33
00:03:06,531 --> 00:03:08,567
in your own income bracket?

34
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:09,396
- Chad.

35
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:14,642
[Ralph groans]

36
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:17,714
- I bet you're real sorry
 you opened your mouth, huh?

37
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:18,577
- Shove it, Chad.

38
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:23,064
- Hey, I haven't cracked
 anybody's skull in a week.

39
00:03:24,307 --> 00:03:25,860
- You seem to be
 having a hard time

40
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,966
understanding the order of
 things around here, Ralph.

41
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:29,312
See, I'm like

42
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:31,487
God,

43
00:03:31,487 --> 00:03:33,213
and you're like, I don't know,

44
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,802
dirt.

45
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:38,666
So when I want
 something from you,

46
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:42,222
lunch money, car,
 kidney, whatever,

47
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,464
you give.

48
00:03:43,464 --> 00:03:44,845
'Cause if you don't give,

49
00:03:44,845 --> 00:03:46,674
I got a whole set of
golf clubs in my locker

50
00:03:46,674 --> 00:03:48,193
I can use on you.

51
00:03:48,193 --> 00:03:50,644
You ever get whacked
with a nine iron, Ralph?

52
00:03:50,644 --> 00:03:52,232
It hurts.

53
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,819
Just ask my stepdad.

54
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,166
- You hit your stepdad
 with a golf club?

55
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,720
- Hey, what can I say?

56
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,342
I really wanted that sports car.

57
00:04:00,826 --> 00:04:02,242
See you around, loser.

58
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:08,627
[Ralph groans]

59
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,428
- Man, I hate those
 preppy buttheads.

60
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:20,225
[soft music]

61
00:04:24,712 --> 00:04:26,921
- And because of this agreement,

62
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:28,992
North America was plunged into

63
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:32,410
several hundred years
 of bloody civil unrest

64
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,758
that has stayed a part of
 our culture to this very day.

65
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:39,071
Now, can anyone else
 contribute something

66
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:42,247
on the Oglethorpe-Bratwurst
 Accord of 1791?

67
00:04:46,596 --> 00:04:48,080
How about you, Ralph?

68
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,497
You seem to be busy as
 a beaver over there.

69
00:04:52,015 --> 00:04:52,844
Ralph?

70
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:56,848
Ralph?

71
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:58,919
- Ralph.

72
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,509
- Um--

73
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:05,305
- Ralph, you know while I
appreciate the pretty pictures,

74
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:09,688
I have to remind you,
 this is not art class.

75
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:11,414
- Sorry, Mrs. O'Houlihan.

76
00:05:12,622 --> 00:05:14,797
- I suppose you're
 safe for the day,

77
00:05:14,797 --> 00:05:16,316
but take it to heart when I say

78
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,835
that those who do
 not remember the past

79
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:20,803
are doomed to repeat it.

80
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:24,151
Next year, that is.

81
00:05:24,151 --> 00:05:26,705
Bear that in mind and I
 will see you all tomorrow,

82
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:29,743
[bell rings]
 toodles.

83
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:32,228
- Oh, man, can you
 believe this crap?

84
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:35,231
We've got our Introduction
 to Manual Labor class next.

85
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:36,439
We have to go down
 to the basement

86
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,578
and help the construction guys

87
00:05:37,578 --> 00:05:39,269
dig up the new teachers' lounge.

88
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:41,202
If you ask me,
 it's a total scam.

89
00:05:41,202 --> 00:05:42,894
- So why did you take the class?

90
00:05:42,894 --> 00:05:44,344
- What?

91
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,138
You don't believe a woman's
 capable of manual labor?

92
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:47,623
- [chuckles] Why is
 it that every time

93
00:05:47,623 --> 00:05:48,900
I get under your skin a little,

94
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,557
you bring up the whole
 women's rights issue?

95
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:52,593
- I don't know, easy out maybe.

96
00:05:52,593 --> 00:05:53,801
- Mm-hmm.

97
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:55,078
- And, uh, speaking
 of women, Ralph,

98
00:05:55,078 --> 00:05:56,321
when are you gonna
 find you somebody?

99
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:58,012
- Oh, don't start
 again, okay, Baxter?

100
00:05:58,012 --> 00:05:59,289
- Hey, I'm just trying
to give you some credit.

101
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:01,464
I mean, you're
 not a monk, right?

102
00:06:01,464 --> 00:06:05,157
- Well, maybe there
 is one person.

103
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:06,055
- No kidding? Who?

104
00:06:07,643 --> 00:06:08,644
- Oh, somebody.

105
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,612
- Felicia St. Clair?

106
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:13,994
Dude, forget it, she's
 head cheerleader.

107
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:15,236
And she's popular,

108
00:06:15,236 --> 00:06:18,481
and she's dating about
250 pounds of bad meat.

109
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:21,070
- Flash Gunderson. [chuckles]

110
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,589
He's not so great.

111
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:26,731
I mean, you take away
his money, his nice car,

112
00:06:26,731 --> 00:06:29,043
his muscles, and his good looks,

113
00:06:29,043 --> 00:06:30,631
and what do you got?

114
00:06:30,631 --> 00:06:31,839
- You?

115
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,840
[Baxter fake chuckles]
 [Baxter chuckles]

116
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,360
[tense music]

117
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:38,950
- Oh, no.

118
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,090
- Oh. [sighs]

119
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,299
- You staring at my
girlfriend again, Ralph?

120
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:45,819
- Just stop it, Flash,

121
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:47,786
I am tired of you picking
 on people all the time.

122
00:06:47,786 --> 00:06:50,030
- This is my battle, sweet pea.

123
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,170
You just stand back and
dodge this geek's guts

124
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,171
when they start flying.

125
00:06:53,171 --> 00:06:54,172
- You don't own me.

126
00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:56,381
- I wasn't looking, Flash.

127
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:58,107
- I saw you, butthead!

128
00:07:00,316 --> 00:07:01,766
Next time,

129
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:04,424
I'm gonna rip off your head
 and spit down your neck!

130
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,425
Got it, geek?

131
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:08,669
Keep your eyes on
 your comic books!

132
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:09,877
- I'm real sorry, Ralph.

133
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,846
- Stop talking to that freak.

134
00:07:14,572 --> 00:07:16,021
Honey?

135
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:17,229
What?

136
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,058
What did I say?

137
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,993
- That wasn't so good, Ralph.

138
00:07:21,993 --> 00:07:23,615
- [chuckles] You don't say?

139
00:07:23,615 --> 00:07:25,134
[bell rings]

140
00:07:25,134 --> 00:07:26,929
Oh, crap, we got about five
 seconds to get to the basement

141
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:29,000
before Lipkis has
 one serious freakout.

142
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,591
- I want you to pay close,
 particular attention

143
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:37,146
to that pickax operator working
on that wall over there.

144
00:07:37,146 --> 00:07:40,839
There will be a quiz tomorrow
 on the use of the pickax.

145
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:43,428
I expect every one of
you to demonstrate to me

146
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:45,016
the proper use and handling

147
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:48,260
of a Hirsch model-P
 titanium-tipped
 rock-breaking device.

148
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,469
[clears throat]

149
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,195
Those of you who have
notes from your mommies

150
00:07:52,195 --> 00:07:54,784
will be excused
 from the exercise.

151
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,822
The rest of you, listen up,

152
00:07:57,822 --> 00:08:00,480
this class is Introduction
 to Manual Labor,

153
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,620
not Introduction to Needlepoint.

154
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,862
Now I wanna start seeing

155
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:06,140
some serious sweat
 and blood around here!

156
00:08:09,074 --> 00:08:11,042
Hold it right there!

157
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,978
Well, what do we have
here? A couple of AWOLs?

158
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:17,945
Not on my watch, no, sir.

159
00:08:17,945 --> 00:08:20,120
- Um, sorry we're late, sir.

160
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,054
Uh, but we have a
 really good reason.

161
00:08:23,054 --> 00:08:26,609
- Uh, yeah, see, Ralph
 here's a hemophiliac, right?

162
00:08:26,609 --> 00:08:28,128
And his nose started to bleed,

163
00:08:28,128 --> 00:08:29,750
so we had to staunch
 the blood flow

164
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,511
before he went into a coma.

165
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,373
Right?

166
00:08:32,373 --> 00:08:34,721
- Um, a coma, right.

167
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:36,654
- I'll just bet.

168
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:37,896
This is the third time

169
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:39,795
you two have been late
 for class this week.

170
00:08:39,795 --> 00:08:41,521
- We're awful sorry,
 Mr. Lipschitz.

171
00:08:42,487 --> 00:08:43,661
[Ralph chuckles]

172
00:08:43,661 --> 00:08:47,837
- That's Lipkis, young
 lady, Mr. Lipkis.

173
00:08:47,837 --> 00:08:51,531
- Right, Lipkis, uh,
 we're real sorry.

174
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,739
- You're sorry?

175
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:54,361
I'm sorry.

176
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:58,158
I'm sorry I wound up with
 two sad sacks of silly putty

177
00:08:58,158 --> 00:08:59,608
who can't find it
 in their hearts

178
00:08:59,608 --> 00:09:01,679
to show up to my class on time!

179
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,854
- Look, whatever we have
to do to make it up,

180
00:09:04,854 --> 00:09:05,683
we'll do it.

181
00:09:06,891 --> 00:09:10,032
- Well, I'm glad to
hear you say that, son,

182
00:09:10,032 --> 00:09:12,413
'cause the two of you are
 gonna stay after school

183
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:15,278
and clean every brick in
the old boundary wall,

184
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:17,867
with these!
 [gong]

185
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:19,386
- Oh, you and your big mouth.

186
00:09:21,284 --> 00:09:22,113
- But, Mr. Lipkis--

187
00:09:22,113 --> 00:09:23,632
- No buts!

188
00:09:23,632 --> 00:09:26,082
Now I wanna see you
 down here after school

189
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:29,016
busting your tailbone
 on that brick wall!

190
00:09:29,016 --> 00:09:31,881
And if I find you
 being late for that,

191
00:09:31,881 --> 00:09:35,989
I'm gonna put you on
 sewer-pipe detail, comprende?

192
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:38,198
- Yes, sir.

193
00:09:38,198 --> 00:09:39,026
- Sure.

194
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:40,821
- Carry on.

195
00:09:44,031 --> 00:09:45,308
[Baxter sighs]

196
00:09:45,308 --> 00:09:47,000
- It's not even a
 Reach toothbrush.

197
00:09:51,798 --> 00:09:53,006
Well, if you're tired

198
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:53,869
of getting pushed
 around by those guys,

199
00:09:53,869 --> 00:09:55,871
you gotta push back.

200
00:09:55,871 --> 00:09:58,736
- And get the crap beaten
 out of me by Flash?

201
00:09:58,736 --> 00:09:59,875
No, thanks.

202
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,117
- Well, you're already getting

203
00:10:01,117 --> 00:10:02,774
the crap beat out of
 you anyway, right?

204
00:10:02,774 --> 00:10:03,948
- Well, there's degrees of crap

205
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:06,053
that can be beaten out of you.

206
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:08,538
I mean, you hit back,
 you up the ante.

207
00:10:08,538 --> 00:10:09,678
- So what do you wanna do?

208
00:10:09,678 --> 00:10:10,817
You wanna be afraid
 of those guys

209
00:10:10,817 --> 00:10:13,992
the rest of your life?
 [tense music]

210
00:10:22,173 --> 00:10:24,106
- There's something on the
 other side of this wall.

211
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:26,211
- Ew, I bet it's
 that old sewer pipe.

212
00:10:26,211 --> 00:10:27,868
Best we don't go
there, you know?

213
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,286
[taps on brick]

214
00:10:32,286 --> 00:10:33,184
- It's hollow.

215
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,636
Maybe it's an old bomb shelter?

216
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,258
- Or maybe it's a secret passage

217
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:41,123
to the boys' locker
 room, huh? [chuckles]

218
00:10:41,123 --> 00:10:42,400
Hey, I can dream, can't I?

219
00:10:53,307 --> 00:10:56,000
It's definitely a
 door to something.

220
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,518
- Yeah.

221
00:10:57,518 --> 00:11:00,383
But it doesn't have any knobs,
 or keyholes, or anything.

222
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:01,902
- Well, I bet that's the
 way you open it right there.

223
00:11:01,902 --> 00:11:03,490
It's kinda shaped like a hand.

224
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,423
- Yeah, but it only
 has three fingers.

225
00:11:05,423 --> 00:11:06,907
- Maybe it's the
Bugs Bunny lock.

226
00:11:06,907 --> 00:11:09,910
- Or maybe it's the universal
 sign for keep the heck out.

227
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,705
- Man, I bet it's just one
 of those old bomb shelters

228
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:12,982
they used to make.

229
00:11:12,982 --> 00:11:13,914
I heard my grandpa
 talking about 'em,

230
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:15,398
you know, back in the old days,

231
00:11:15,398 --> 00:11:17,469
when they used to make those
 record player thingies.

232
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:20,024
- This doesn't look like it
 was made in the old days.

233
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,717
I do not think this
 is a good idea.

234
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,408
- Take a Xanax, okay, Ralph?

235
00:11:27,548 --> 00:11:30,897
[door whooshes]

236
00:11:30,897 --> 00:11:33,347
[door opens]

237
00:11:37,938 --> 00:11:40,354
- What do you think?

238
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:43,116
[dramatic music]

239
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,728
[tense music]

240
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,530
Maybe we should
 see what's inside?

241
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,531
- You first.

242
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:21,430
- Okay.

243
00:12:22,845 --> 00:12:24,813
- What? Are we gonna,
 like, brush 'em to death?

244
00:12:24,813 --> 00:12:26,538
- Hey, you know,

245
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,023
you can put someone's
 eye out with one of these

246
00:12:28,023 --> 00:12:29,265
if you try hard enough.

247
00:12:33,476 --> 00:12:34,926
[Ralph gasps]

248
00:12:34,926 --> 00:12:35,755
- The lights came on when
 you stepped in there.

249
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,928
- Yeah, not a good sign.

250
00:12:40,035 --> 00:12:40,829
- Whoa.

251
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:43,935
This is totally trippy.

252
00:12:43,935 --> 00:12:45,488
- Yeah.

253
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:46,869
What in the hell is it?

254
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:53,807
- Wow.

255
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,119
- These look like guns.

256
00:13:00,158 --> 00:13:00,952
Big guns.

257
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,060
It's like a storeroom
 or something.

258
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,302
- Yeah, but for what?

259
00:13:06,302 --> 00:13:08,028
I mean, these things
 don't even look real.

260
00:13:11,894 --> 00:13:13,896
- Maybe they were props
 for a movie or something.

261
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:17,589
Or toys.

262
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:21,455
- Maybe it's a secret
government stockpile, you know,

263
00:13:21,455 --> 00:13:24,424
like where they keep all that
 crazy stuff from Area 54?

264
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,499
- Studio 54, and we are
nowhere near Area 51.

265
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:31,914
- See?

266
00:13:31,914 --> 00:13:33,640
That's what makes it
 such a good hiding place.

267
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:48,482
Oh, wow.
 - These feel like plastic.

268
00:13:54,903 --> 00:13:56,628
- That's definitely the
 weirdest football uniform

269
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:57,595
I ever saw.

270
00:13:57,595 --> 00:13:59,355
- It's not a football uniform.

271
00:13:59,355 --> 00:14:00,356
- Lacrosse?

272
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:06,155
- Whatever it is,
 it's mechanical.

273
00:14:06,155 --> 00:14:08,640
See, the power supply's in the
 back, kinda like a spacesuit.

274
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,538
[Baxter gasps]

275
00:14:09,538 --> 00:14:10,573
- Spacesuit?

276
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,442
[taps glass]

277
00:14:17,442 --> 00:14:19,928
- What the heck is this thing?

278
00:14:19,928 --> 00:14:22,792
- I don't know, but whatever
 it is, it doesn't look good.

279
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:27,728
- Hmm.

280
00:14:27,728 --> 00:14:29,730
[computer beeps]

281
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,422
- [scoffs] Nice clock.

282
00:14:32,975 --> 00:14:34,390
[computer beeps]

283
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,322
Whoa, you see that?

284
00:14:37,324 --> 00:14:40,189
- 75, 76, 77, 78 slashes.

285
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:41,984
- Why are you counting them?

286
00:14:41,984 --> 00:14:43,883
- I don't know, it
 might be important.

287
00:14:45,608 --> 00:14:46,540
- Hey, what are you doing now?

288
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,371
- I'm serious, I'm taking notes.

289
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:51,304
That's the first rule you
 learn in journalism class,

290
00:14:51,304 --> 00:14:52,926
you gotta take notes
of every little detail,

291
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,721
so I'm gonna write
 this stuff down.

292
00:14:56,205 --> 00:14:58,828
- Wonder who all this
 stuff belongs to?

293
00:14:58,828 --> 00:15:01,072
- Well, chances are
 it won't be cool

294
00:15:01,072 --> 00:15:03,661
if somebody finds out we've
 been in here, you know?

295
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:14,396
- We don't tell anybody
about this, okay?

296
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:17,364
- Okay, you think this
 will fool Mr. Lipkis?

297
00:15:17,364 --> 00:15:19,297
- Just as long as he
 doesn't come back to reality

298
00:15:19,297 --> 00:15:21,196
for any length of time,

299
00:15:21,196 --> 00:15:22,128
sure.

300
00:15:22,128 --> 00:15:23,957
- All right, let's go.

301
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:37,902
[Flash chuckles]

302
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:39,455
- Nice trip.

303
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:40,525
See you next fall.

304
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:44,357
- Ralph, you're
 going the wrong way!

305
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:46,497
- Why don't you leave
 me alone, Flash?

306
00:15:46,497 --> 00:15:48,809
- Oh, you're ready
 to rumble now, geek?

307
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:50,501
- I'm really getting
 tired of this, Flash!

308
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:52,192
What are you, eight?

309
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:53,642
- Hey,

310
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:56,058
I'm just playing with
 the little bookworm.

311
00:15:56,058 --> 00:15:57,163
Get off my case.

312
00:15:57,163 --> 00:15:58,440
- If you don't knock it off,

313
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,751
you're gonna get off
 my case for a while,

314
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:00,683
do you know what I mean?

315
00:16:00,683 --> 00:16:01,961
- Come on, Ralph, time to go.

316
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,447
- What do you mean?
 - What is wrong with you?

317
00:16:05,447 --> 00:16:07,483
- I told you to watch out for
 the old hallway leg sweep,

318
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:09,313
it's Flash's favorite move.

319
00:16:09,313 --> 00:16:10,935
- Why did you pull me away, huh?

320
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:13,041
I thought you were the one

321
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:13,973
telling me to stand
 up for myself?

322
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,422
- Well, start smaller, okay?

323
00:16:15,422 --> 00:16:16,837
Look, Ralph, you're
 my best friend,

324
00:16:16,837 --> 00:16:18,184
but I'm gonna be
 straight with you,

325
00:16:18,184 --> 00:16:20,117
Flash Gunderson
 could snap your spine

326
00:16:20,117 --> 00:16:22,533
like a Slim Jim at a
 Weight Watchers convention.

327
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:27,710
[tense music]

328
00:16:32,094 --> 00:16:32,957
What's wrong?

329
00:16:46,143 --> 00:16:48,455
Whoa, what's up
 with the new kids?

330
00:16:48,455 --> 00:16:50,112
And I thought I had problems.

331
00:16:50,112 --> 00:16:50,975
- You do.

332
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:59,535
We got our next class
 with them, so don't stare.

333
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:23,042
[tense music]

334
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,564
[clock ticks]

335
00:17:34,122 --> 00:17:35,640
- God,

336
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,091
it's like looking at another
 fucking race or something.

337
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:38,954
Creepy.

338
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,301
- Maybe they're triplets.

339
00:17:42,406 --> 00:17:44,822
- Hola, everyone.

340
00:17:44,822 --> 00:17:45,754
Today,

341
00:17:45,754 --> 00:17:47,169
we will be continuing the lovely

342
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:49,447
and infinitely-fascinating saga

343
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:53,624
of the Bloombottom-Spattlesgore
Tariff of 1897.

344
00:17:53,624 --> 00:17:55,660
So if we can all just
 open our text to...

345
00:17:58,146 --> 00:17:59,595
Well, my goodness,

346
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:02,978
it seems as if we have picked
 up a few new passengers

347
00:18:02,978 --> 00:18:04,980
on our journey to knowledge.

348
00:18:06,706 --> 00:18:09,364
Well, allow me to
 introduce myself,

349
00:18:09,364 --> 00:18:12,332
I am your teacher,
 Mrs. O'Houlihan,

350
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:14,783
and I will be your tour guide

351
00:18:14,783 --> 00:18:16,992
through American history
class, third period,

352
00:18:16,992 --> 00:18:19,443
a most rewarding
 human experience.

353
00:18:19,443 --> 00:18:20,513
And you are?

354
00:18:20,513 --> 00:18:21,445
- Phil.

355
00:18:21,445 --> 00:18:22,377
- Bill.

356
00:18:22,377 --> 00:18:23,274
- Jill.

357
00:18:23,274 --> 00:18:24,965
- Well, isn't that nice?

358
00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:26,967
You all rhyme. [chuckles]

359
00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:29,246
- We are foreign
 exchange students.

360
00:18:29,246 --> 00:18:32,007
- Do you have last
names to share with us?

361
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:32,835
- No.

362
00:18:34,423 --> 00:18:35,735
- I see.

363
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:38,393
- Well, I suppose
 all oogly stuff

364
00:18:38,393 --> 00:18:40,291
is for Student Admissions
 to worry about.

365
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,775
In the meantime,

366
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:44,709
sit back and enjoy the
 wonderful little day trip

367
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:48,161
we are about to take
 through American history.

368
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:57,412
[tense music]

369
00:18:58,654 --> 00:19:00,829
- Maybe they're from
New Jersey or something.

370
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,874
[upbeat music]

371
00:19:11,874 --> 00:19:12,841
Man, can you believe
 those new kids?

372
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:13,842
Total creepazoids.

373
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:16,569
- They're, like, the least of
 our problems right now, okay?

374
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:18,467
Hey, did you bring
 those big duffle bags?

375
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:21,608
- Yeah, but what are we
 gonna do with all the stuff?

376
00:19:21,608 --> 00:19:23,058
- We'll put what we can
in our lockers for now

377
00:19:23,058 --> 00:19:24,922
until we can figure
 out a safer place.

378
00:19:24,922 --> 00:19:27,856
- Great plan, so what if it's
 radioactive or something?

379
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:29,961
- Then, uh, we'd
 be dead right now.

380
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,136
Where did you think
 we were gonna put it?

381
00:19:32,136 --> 00:19:34,069
- I don't know, your room?

382
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:35,622
- Thanks.
 [door opens]

[tense music]

384
00:19:45,322 --> 00:19:47,565
Can you believe those
 guys? [chuckles]

385
00:19:47,565 --> 00:19:48,911
- We would like to sit here.

386
00:19:48,911 --> 00:19:49,843
- Alone.

387
00:19:49,843 --> 00:19:50,672
- Thank you.

388
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,295
- Hey, listen here, blondie,

389
00:19:53,295 --> 00:19:54,814
I don't know where you're from,

390
00:19:54,814 --> 00:19:57,334
but around here, it's first
 come, first serve, all right?

391
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:04,203
[electricity buzzes]
 [glass shatters]

392
00:20:04,686 --> 00:20:05,100
Enjoy.

393
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,333
- Secure the perimeter
 before you close up tonight.

394
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,300
They're everywhere.

395
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:37,822
- That guy's crazy.

396
00:20:37,822 --> 00:20:41,688
[construction worker chuckles]

397
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:50,076
[tense music]

398
00:20:50,076 --> 00:20:51,871
- Gee, that was close.

399
00:20:53,528 --> 00:20:55,150
- Looks like the wall's
held up pretty good.

400
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:55,944
- Yeah.

401
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,641
[drops brick]

402
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:06,161

[tracker beeps]

405
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:46,615
- What is it?

406
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:51,068
- Someone has opened the
 arsenal for a second time.

407
00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:51,862
We're close.

408
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,556
It's somewhere
 inside this building.

409
00:22:05,393 --> 00:22:06,255
- Okay,

410
00:22:07,498 --> 00:22:09,638
two pistol thingies,

411
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:14,125
and two sets of
 aluminum long johns.

412
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,130
[computer beeps]

413
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:19,993
- I don't get it,

414
00:22:21,201 --> 00:22:24,135
everything else in this
room is out in the open,

415
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:25,067
except this thing.

416
00:22:26,206 --> 00:22:28,277
- Hey, what happened
with that clock thingy?

417
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:31,453
There's only 54 slashes.

418
00:22:31,453 --> 00:22:33,938
Oh, just what I thought,
yesterday there were 78.

419
00:22:35,457 --> 00:22:36,700
- So?

420
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:41,256
- So, we were here at
five o'clock yesterday,

421
00:22:41,256 --> 00:22:43,223
78 slashes,

422
00:22:43,223 --> 00:22:45,847
so now, 5:15 today,

423
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:49,540
roughly the same time we were
 here yesterday, 54 slashes.

424
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,611
This is why you don't read
 comics in class, braino,

425
00:22:51,611 --> 00:22:53,061
you gotta do the math.

426
00:22:53,061 --> 00:22:55,891
24 slashes gone, 24 hours,

427
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:58,100
it is some kinda clock,

428
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,757
it runs by hours, not minutes.

429
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,311
- Pretty weird clock,
 don't you think?

430
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:03,278
- It makes about as much sense

431
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:04,762
as anything else in this room.

432
00:23:07,627 --> 00:23:09,491
Oh, maybe we should
 pick that up too.

433
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,771
- Hey, I do not think
that's such a hot idea.

434
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:16,395
We should just leave this here.

435
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,017
- Well, what if
somebody else finds it?

436
00:23:18,017 --> 00:23:19,190
- [Ralph] If we can't open,

437
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,675
the chances are
 whoever else finds it

438
00:23:20,675 --> 00:23:21,883
won't be able to either.

439
00:23:23,885 --> 00:23:27,544
- Oh, wow, man, I'm
definitely taking this.

440
00:23:27,544 --> 00:23:29,269
This'll look pretty
 cool in my room.

441
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:30,754
- Oh, no.

442
00:23:30,754 --> 00:23:33,412
You are not using any of this
 stuff as a lava lamp, okay?

443
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,862
Let's just get what we
 can into our lockers

444
00:23:35,862 --> 00:23:36,863
and be done with it.

445
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:54,329
- Uh-oh.

446
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:57,919
- Hey, baby doll.

447
00:23:59,368 --> 00:24:01,094
Looks like you're having some
 problems with your locker.

448
00:24:01,094 --> 00:24:03,614
- Uh, yeah, Chad, I was just
 cleaning some stuff out.

449
00:24:03,614 --> 00:24:07,204
You know, it was starting to
scare me to open it. [chuckles]

450
00:24:07,204 --> 00:24:08,205
- What do we have here?

451
00:24:08,205 --> 00:24:09,378
- Oh, that's just some stuff

452
00:24:09,378 --> 00:24:11,035
I had sitting
 around in my locker.

453
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:12,347
- Let's take a look and see.

454
00:24:12,347 --> 00:24:14,901
[Baxter sighs]

455
00:24:16,903 --> 00:24:18,491
[Chad chuckles]

456
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:21,011
You have a bag full of
 toys in your locker?

457
00:24:21,011 --> 00:24:23,254
- Yeah, it's just
 a bag full of toys,

458
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:27,742
that's me, I'm a big, fat
 baby, goo-goo. [chuckles]

459
00:24:27,742 --> 00:24:29,364
- Stupid toy guns?

460
00:24:34,852 --> 00:24:35,681
Pow!

461
00:24:36,889 --> 00:24:39,547
[Chad chuckles]

462
00:24:41,307 --> 00:24:42,239
Zap!

463
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:44,793
[Baxter sighs]

464
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,729
- Chad...

465
00:24:49,729 --> 00:24:50,937
- What?

466
00:24:50,937 --> 00:24:52,180
You're afraid I'm
 gonna pull the trigger

467
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,837
and you're gonna get squirted?

468
00:24:53,837 --> 00:24:56,909
- Mm-hmm.
[Chad chuckles]

469
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:59,670

[Baxter breathes heavily]

472
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:26,421
I guess you were holding
 it the wrong way, polo boy.

473
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,733
Ralph?

474
00:25:27,733 --> 00:25:28,561
Ralph?

475
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,223
- [Ralph] Are you gonna
 tell me why we're out here?

476
00:25:35,223 --> 00:25:37,259
- Yeah, because this part
 of town's pretty much empty,

477
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:39,261
and I don't think we wanna
 attract attention right now,

478
00:25:39,261 --> 00:25:40,331
okay?

479
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:42,368
- Well, all I'm saying is,

480
00:25:43,818 --> 00:25:45,854
I think I saw this place on
 last week's episode of Cops.

481
00:25:45,854 --> 00:25:47,891
- [chuckles] Man, you shoulda
 seen what happened to Chad,

482
00:25:47,891 --> 00:25:49,409
it was awesome.

483
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:50,928
Well, not the part about him
 getting all shot up and stuff,

484
00:25:50,928 --> 00:25:52,412
but the rest of it. [chuckles]

485
00:25:52,412 --> 00:25:53,241
- Yeah?

486
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:54,173
- Yeah.

487
00:25:54,173 --> 00:25:55,588
- Well, now it's serious.

488
00:25:55,588 --> 00:25:57,486
Somebody got killed, okay?

489
00:25:57,486 --> 00:25:58,729
So maybe we should just go
 to the police or something.

490
00:25:58,729 --> 00:26:00,455
- I don't think he got killed.

491
00:26:00,455 --> 00:26:02,561
- You said he just
 vanished, Baxter,

492
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,734
I don't think they can cure that

493
00:26:03,734 --> 00:26:05,253
with a bandaid and
some hydrogen peroxide.

494
00:26:05,253 --> 00:26:06,875
- No, I said he got shot,

495
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:08,359
but some, I don't know,

496
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,775
thing opened up behind him

497
00:26:09,775 --> 00:26:11,708
and sucked him away
 like he was smoke.

498
00:26:12,743 --> 00:26:14,227
- What kind of thing?

499
00:26:15,332 --> 00:26:17,127
- A swirly thing.

500
00:26:17,127 --> 00:26:17,955
I'll show you.

501
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:24,617
Oh.

502
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:27,620
Oops, that woulda sucked.

00:26:29,518 --> 00:26:32,418

505
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,908
- Wow. [chuckles]

506
00:26:39,908 --> 00:26:41,220
This is really serious.
[Baxter chuckles]

507
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,704
- It's a zap gun.

508
00:26:42,704 --> 00:26:45,120
- What I think it is is some
 kind of teleportation device,

509
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,191
you know, like Star Trek.

510
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:48,710
You shoot something with it,

511
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:51,644
and whatever it is you shoot
 gets taken to another place.

512
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:52,749
- Yeah, but where?

513
00:26:52,749 --> 00:26:53,922
- I don't know.

514
00:26:53,922 --> 00:26:54,958
Another dimension?

515
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:56,994
May be a time machine.

516
00:26:58,444 --> 00:27:00,032
But whatever it is,

517
00:27:00,032 --> 00:27:02,759
it's definitely not something
 our guys could've made up.

518
00:27:03,898 --> 00:27:05,554
Or any guys.

519
00:27:05,554 --> 00:27:06,901
- But who?

520
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:07,729
- I don't know.

521
00:27:17,256 --> 00:27:19,154
It doesn't weigh a lot.

522
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,714
[gun charges]

523
00:27:26,714 --> 00:27:27,646
- You hear that?

524
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,233
I think it's gonna blow up.

Wow.

528
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,839
- [chuckles] I hate to say this,

529
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:51,670
but this is incredibly
 freaking cool.

530
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,912
- [chuckles] Yeah.

531
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,503
- Oh, man.

532
00:28:09,826 --> 00:28:11,655
What do you think this does?

533
00:28:11,655 --> 00:28:12,483
- I don't know.

00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,683
- It's a super suit.

538
00:28:39,683 --> 00:28:41,789
You put it on, it gives
you super strength.

539
00:28:44,412 --> 00:28:46,138
Do you know what this means?

540
00:28:46,138 --> 00:28:48,727
- Um, you can try out for
 the football team now?

541
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,626
- This is like superhero stuff,

542
00:28:51,626 --> 00:28:54,422
space cannons, war
 beams, super strength.

543
00:28:55,423 --> 00:28:57,183
It really is like a comic book.

544
00:28:57,183 --> 00:28:58,909
- Yeah, well, that's
all fine for you, Ralph,

545
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:00,600
but I kind of like
 living here on Earth,

546
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,568
you know, with real
 people and stuff.

547
00:29:02,568 --> 00:29:04,535
- That rock was real,
 and I crushed it.

548
00:29:06,296 --> 00:29:09,230
- You look really ridiculous
 in that outfit, you know?

549
00:29:10,162 --> 00:29:10,990
- Your turn.

550
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:25,004
[electricity buzzes]

551
00:29:26,695 --> 00:29:29,906
- I feel really
 stupid in this outfit.

552
00:29:29,906 --> 00:29:31,114
- I think it looks neat.

553
00:29:33,495 --> 00:29:36,602
[tense music]

554
00:29:36,602 --> 00:29:38,190
The new kids.

555
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,122
- Who are you?

556
00:29:39,122 --> 00:29:41,193
Return our arsenal at once.

557
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:43,678
- Uh, arsenal?

558
00:29:43,678 --> 00:29:44,748
- This, Ralph.

559
00:29:52,445 --> 00:29:55,069
[gunfire]

560
00:29:55,069 --> 00:29:56,070
Did you see that?

561
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,623
The new kids have guns.

562
00:29:57,623 --> 00:29:58,520
- I heard about this
 when I was, like...

563
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,695
[gunfire]

564
00:30:04,457 --> 00:30:05,769
Like kids who attack other kids

565
00:30:05,769 --> 00:30:07,115
for their shoes or
 jackets and stuff.

566
00:30:07,115 --> 00:30:07,944
[gunfire]

567
00:30:07,944 --> 00:30:09,048
- Are you insane?

568
00:30:09,048 --> 00:30:11,154
They're after the weapons.

569
00:30:11,154 --> 00:30:15,986
[gunfire]
[fire crackles]

570
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:21,129
[gunfire]

571
00:30:21,129 --> 00:30:23,718
[Ralph groans]

572
00:30:26,203 --> 00:30:27,273
That should've killed me.

573
00:30:27,273 --> 00:30:29,448
[gunfire]

574
00:30:44,739 --> 00:30:46,672
This is a dream, it's gotta be.

575
00:30:46,672 --> 00:30:48,708
- There were people
 shooting at us, Ralph.

576
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:50,676
Is that registering with you?

577
00:30:50,676 --> 00:30:53,368
We have to take this to
the police or something.

578
00:30:53,368 --> 00:30:54,853
It's getting way outta hand.

579
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,614
- Well, maybe we
 shouldn't be so hasty.

580
00:30:57,614 --> 00:31:00,859
- Oh, no, uh-uh, no, we
cannot keep this stuff.

581
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,343
I mean, this isn't like,

582
00:31:02,343 --> 00:31:04,172
"Wow, I found 20 bucks
 in a library book," okay?

583
00:31:04,172 --> 00:31:06,761
I mean, we found some
 freaky space gizmos

584
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:08,349
in a secret room
 under the school,

585
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:10,489
and now people are
 getting zapped,

586
00:31:10,489 --> 00:31:12,008
and we almost got shot up

587
00:31:12,008 --> 00:31:14,424
by three rejects from The
 Sex Pistols Reunion Tour.

588
00:31:14,424 --> 00:31:16,529
How about a little reality
 with that coffee, huh?

589
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:18,531
Don't you remember
 what happened to Chad?

590
00:31:18,531 --> 00:31:21,569
- Right, something
 happened to Chad,

591
00:31:21,569 --> 00:31:24,296
but he pretty much brought
 that upon himself, didn't he?

592
00:31:24,296 --> 00:31:26,470
Now, for whatever reason,

593
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,645
we find these things after
they've been buried underground

594
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:31,441
for maybe hundreds of years,

595
00:31:31,441 --> 00:31:34,064
and I doubt whoever,
 or whatever,

596
00:31:34,064 --> 00:31:36,895
made them is gonna be around
 to come looking for them.

597
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,276
- Are you even listening
to what you're saying?

598
00:31:39,276 --> 00:31:40,899
I mean, this is
 right out there with,

599
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,005
like, Bigfoot and
 Amityville Horror.

600
00:31:44,005 --> 00:31:45,282
- Like I told you before,

601
00:31:45,282 --> 00:31:47,526
the weapons and stuff,
 they're ours now,

602
00:31:47,526 --> 00:31:49,735
and we could use 'em
if we really wanted to.

603
00:31:49,735 --> 00:31:50,598
- For what?

604
00:31:52,151 --> 00:31:55,327
- How would you like to get
 even with Monty, and Flash,

605
00:31:55,327 --> 00:31:57,881
and all those guys who
 keep picking on us?

606
00:31:57,881 --> 00:32:00,573
[dramatic music]

607
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:19,696
[doors open]
 [tense music]

608
00:32:50,382 --> 00:32:51,831
- What the crap?

609
00:32:51,831 --> 00:32:52,763
- Silence!

610
00:32:54,248 --> 00:32:55,249
- Look, I don't know what
 you clowns are doing here,

611
00:32:55,249 --> 00:32:57,182
but Halloween's a way off,

612
00:32:57,182 --> 00:32:58,252
so why don't you
get your stupid,

613
00:32:58,252 --> 00:33:00,081
dumb robot costumes outta here?

614
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:03,015
- No, Flash Gunderson
 of Earth, we will not.

615
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,949
- All right, well,

616
00:33:05,949 --> 00:33:07,606
then how's about a knuckle
 sandwich from fist city?

617
00:33:07,606 --> 00:33:08,434
[punches metal]

618
00:33:08,434 --> 00:33:11,023
[Flash groans]

619
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:15,027
[Flash groans]

620
00:33:15,027 --> 00:33:16,995
[knuckles crack]

621
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,445
- As you can see, Earth boy,

622
00:33:19,445 --> 00:33:23,691
your puny muscles are no match
 against our superior might.

623
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:25,037
- You almost broke my hand.

624
00:33:27,695 --> 00:33:29,317
Who are you?

625
00:33:29,317 --> 00:33:33,632
- We are alien terminators
 from the planet Mandark.

626
00:33:33,632 --> 00:33:36,393
- We are here to render
 final judgment against you,

627
00:33:36,393 --> 00:33:40,363
Flash Gunderson, for your
 crimes against humanity.

628
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:43,021
- What crimes?

629
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:43,883
- Silence!

630
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,095
It is we who ask the
 questions around here,

631
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:50,269
if, uh, we have any,

632
00:33:51,788 --> 00:33:52,961
which we don't.

633
00:33:53,893 --> 00:33:54,825
At any rate,

634
00:33:56,241 --> 00:33:59,416
you have preyed upon the
 weak and smaller around you,

635
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:02,143
you've also abused your
 position on the football team

636
00:34:02,143 --> 00:34:03,869
to terrorize the innocent,

637
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:06,872
and also to date all of
the really hot chicks,

638
00:34:06,872 --> 00:34:08,908
so nobody else gets a shot.

639
00:34:08,908 --> 00:34:11,877
- Hey, I got needs
 too, you know?

640
00:34:11,877 --> 00:34:13,292
- Because of these crimes,

641
00:34:13,292 --> 00:34:14,673
we have decreed to sentence you

642
00:34:14,673 --> 00:34:18,021
to a life of repenting
 your evil ways.

643
00:34:18,021 --> 00:34:19,885
You will give up
 your life as a jock

644
00:34:19,885 --> 00:34:21,783
and spend your remaining
years in high school

645
00:34:21,783 --> 00:34:24,027
maintaining a 4.0 average.

646
00:34:24,027 --> 00:34:26,374
- You will stop drinking.

647
00:34:26,374 --> 00:34:28,169
- You will do homework.

648
00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:30,689
- You will only date girls
 on the yearbook staff,

649
00:34:30,689 --> 00:34:33,416
and you will only
 wear button-up shirts.

650
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:35,694
- You will become
 a caring nurturer.

651
00:34:35,694 --> 00:34:38,248
- Studying will
 become your life.

652
00:34:38,248 --> 00:34:40,216
- This is a load of bull.

653
00:34:40,216 --> 00:34:43,357
Nobody's gonna make
 me study, nobody.

654
00:34:43,357 --> 00:34:44,427
- You will.

655
00:34:44,427 --> 00:34:46,601
- Oh, yeah, and if I don't?

656
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:48,914
[fires gun]

657
00:34:48,914 --> 00:34:51,330
[Chad moans]

658
00:34:57,474 --> 00:34:59,442
That sounded like Chad Garrison.

659
00:34:59,442 --> 00:35:00,995
- Yes,

660
00:35:00,995 --> 00:35:04,378
Chad was being what you Earth
 people refer to as a butthead,

661
00:35:04,378 --> 00:35:07,622
so we had to banish
 him to Dimension X.

662
00:35:07,622 --> 00:35:08,899
- Dimension X?

663
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:11,005
- That's where the
 bad people go, Flash.

664
00:35:11,005 --> 00:35:13,318
And that's where you'll go,

665
00:35:13,318 --> 00:35:15,320
unless you change your attitude

666
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,082
and do everything which we
 have instructed you to do.

667
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:22,465
- You don't want to be a
butthead, do you, Flash?

668
00:35:22,465 --> 00:35:23,811
- No.

669
00:35:23,811 --> 00:35:26,227
- Good, then we will
 be watching you,

670
00:35:26,227 --> 00:35:28,747
every minute, every day,

671
00:35:28,747 --> 00:35:30,507
to make sure that you
 are living the life

672
00:35:30,507 --> 00:35:31,922
of a complete bookworm

673
00:35:33,096 --> 00:35:35,478
and maintaining a 4.0 average.

674
00:35:35,478 --> 00:35:37,169
Fail us

675
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:39,654
and you will be
spending a long vacation

676
00:35:39,654 --> 00:35:42,140
with your friend Chad.

677
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,279
- Yes.

678
00:35:43,279 --> 00:35:44,901
I mean, no, I won't
 fail you guys.

679
00:35:44,901 --> 00:35:48,076
- Zantar of Mandark has spoken.

680
00:35:48,076 --> 00:35:50,838
[tense music]

681
00:35:50,838 --> 00:35:52,909
- Uh, thanks.

682
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:05,646
[doors open]

683
00:36:09,063 --> 00:36:11,548
Man, they really hurt my hand.

684
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:23,560
[Baxter chuckles]

685
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,803
- [chuckles] Can
 you believe that?

686
00:36:24,803 --> 00:36:27,185
I mean, Flash was
 almost in tears.

687
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,393
- Yeah, I don't even care

688
00:36:28,393 --> 00:36:29,911
if he goes through with
that studying jazz,

689
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:31,741
because it was worth it just
 to see that look on his face.

690
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:33,329
[Ralph chuckles]

691
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:35,676
- I mean, this is really
 gonna change things, Baxter.

692
00:36:35,676 --> 00:36:37,747
I mean, all of these
 years in school,

693
00:36:37,747 --> 00:36:39,197
and for once,

694
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,543
we're not gonna have to worry
 about getting picked on.

695
00:36:40,543 --> 00:36:41,889
- Well, maybe we
 shouldn't get too excited

696
00:36:41,889 --> 00:36:43,615
about this stuff, Ralph.

697
00:36:43,615 --> 00:36:45,099
It's insane,

698
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:46,031
I mean, there's gotta be a
 bigger purpose for this stuff

699
00:36:46,031 --> 00:36:47,550
than just to scare the life

700
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,000
out of a lunkhead
 football player, you know?

701
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,692
And what about those
 three new kids?

702
00:36:51,692 --> 00:36:54,764
- Well, as long as
 we have this stuff,

703
00:36:54,764 --> 00:36:56,524
nobody's gonna mess with us.

704
00:36:56,524 --> 00:36:58,077
- I don't know, call me crazy,

705
00:36:58,077 --> 00:36:59,769
but getting shot at's messing
 with me pretty good, you know?

706
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:02,116
[bell rings]

707
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:10,504
[tense music]

708
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:21,549
- Nice curves.

709
00:37:21,549 --> 00:37:22,930
- Oh, hi, Lance.

710
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:25,795
Sorry, I was so busy
 painting, I didn't notice you.

711
00:37:25,795 --> 00:37:27,590
Say, where's Monty and Chad?

712
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,868
You three are usually
 always together.

713
00:37:29,868 --> 00:37:31,352
- I thought I'd take
 this opportunity

714
00:37:31,352 --> 00:37:33,320
to spend a little
 alone time with you.

715
00:37:34,804 --> 00:37:37,393
- I always thought of myself
 as more of a people person.

716
00:37:37,393 --> 00:37:41,120
You know, big groups,
 lots of exit doors.

717
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,226
- Hot little ticket like you?

718
00:37:43,226 --> 00:37:46,264
No, see, I'm thinking
 quiet dinner for two,

719
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,957
candles, wine, nice
music, just you and, uh,

720
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:53,167
me.

721
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:55,859
- Nice cologne.

722
00:37:57,067 --> 00:38:00,485
- I'm not wearing any
 cologne, it's Vitalis.

723
00:38:00,485 --> 00:38:02,625
- Okay, Lance, you know what?

724
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:03,902
This slick act might work

725
00:38:03,902 --> 00:38:06,145
with some of your
 junior high girls,

726
00:38:06,145 --> 00:38:07,975
but I usually make a
 rule of not dating anyone

727
00:38:07,975 --> 00:38:11,530
whose nails spend more time
 in the salon than mine do.

728
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:14,878
- You want I should do
 neanderthal thing like Flash?

729
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:19,780
Me so sweaty, me take hot
 cheerleader after big game.

730
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,643
You like that better?

731
00:38:20,643 --> 00:38:22,300
- No means no!

732
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,785
A kick in the pants
 means no too, got it?

733
00:38:24,785 --> 00:38:26,580
I'm not interested!

734
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,272
Anyway, Flash will probably
 show up in about five seconds

735
00:38:29,272 --> 00:38:31,032
to walk me to
 cheerleading practice,

736
00:38:31,032 --> 00:38:32,310
so if I were you, I'd jet.

737
00:38:33,794 --> 00:38:36,486
- Mm, nope, I don't
 see Flash anywhere.

738
00:38:37,936 --> 00:38:40,697
Anyway, it's not like I'm
 asking you to marry me.

739
00:38:40,697 --> 00:38:41,974
I just want a chance

740
00:38:41,974 --> 00:38:43,976
to see you in action
 after the big game.

741
00:38:43,976 --> 00:38:48,084
Nothing sleazy, just you,
 me, your cheerleader outfit.

742
00:38:48,084 --> 00:38:49,534
- Sounds like a blast,

743
00:38:49,534 --> 00:38:52,399
let me get back to you in
 about four years or so, okay?

744
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:53,814
I think you should go now.

745
00:38:53,814 --> 00:38:56,610
- You know, the more you say no,

746
00:38:58,197 --> 00:39:01,511
the more I'm thinking
 you really wanna say yes.

747
00:39:02,409 --> 00:39:03,271
- Great.

748
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:09,036
[communicator beeps]

749
00:39:09,036 --> 00:39:11,072
- Breaker 1-9, breaker
 1-9, this is Big Red,

750
00:39:11,072 --> 00:39:13,834
Smokey's coming up on
 your back door, over.

751
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:15,663
They're walkie-talkies,
just like on Star Trek.

752
00:39:15,663 --> 00:39:17,251
You know, you get
 one, I get one,

753
00:39:17,251 --> 00:39:18,632
and then we can call each other.

754
00:39:18,632 --> 00:39:20,461
- Gee, if it wasn't for these,

755
00:39:20,461 --> 00:39:23,947
I mighta done something
 crazy, like use the phone.

756
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:25,742
[Baxter scoffs]

757
00:39:25,742 --> 00:39:27,019
- I wonder what these do?

758
00:39:27,019 --> 00:39:28,296
- I don't know.

759
00:39:29,263 --> 00:39:32,784
[goggles power up]

760
00:39:32,784 --> 00:39:35,511
[tense music]

761
00:39:35,511 --> 00:39:36,443
[Baxter gasps]
 What?

762
00:39:36,443 --> 00:39:37,409
- Dude, they're X-ray goggles.

763
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:38,376
- No way?

764
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,792
Let me see those. [chuckles]

765
00:39:42,863 --> 00:39:44,658
I don't see anything
 any different.

766
00:39:45,555 --> 00:39:48,386
[tense music]

767
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,525
- Hola.

768
00:39:49,525 --> 00:39:51,423
- Oh, god. [chuckles]

769
00:39:51,423 --> 00:39:52,493
That was horrible.

770
00:39:54,115 --> 00:39:56,152
You know, I bet if you
 adjust the knobs and stuff,

771
00:39:56,152 --> 00:39:58,188
you'd be able to
 see through walls.

772
00:39:58,188 --> 00:39:59,189
- You think so?

773
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:00,121
- Mm-hmm.
 - Oh, wow,

774
00:40:00,121 --> 00:40:01,053
I bet we could make a fortune

775
00:40:01,053 --> 00:40:02,469
playing poker with those things.

776
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:03,918
- Yeah. [Baxter chuckles]

777
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:06,818
[goggles power up]

778
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:11,478
[tense music]

779
00:40:13,376 --> 00:40:17,000
- You think you're the first
date I had to get the hard way?

780
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,932
- [Baxter] Where are you going?

781
00:40:17,932 --> 00:40:19,417
- To kick some serious butt.

782
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,489
[Baxter scoffs]

783
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:23,766
- Lance, I don't think you know

784
00:40:23,766 --> 00:40:25,319
how much trouble you
 can get in for this.

785
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:27,045
- What? With school?

786
00:40:28,253 --> 00:40:30,220
A rich kid like me gets
a slap on the wrist,

787
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,775
and it doesn't even go
on my permanent record.

788
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:36,088
- What happens when I tell my
 very jealous, jock boyfriend?

789
00:40:36,088 --> 00:40:39,402
- If there's one thing guys
 like Flash are afraid of,

790
00:40:39,402 --> 00:40:41,024
it's guys like me.

791
00:40:41,024 --> 00:40:42,336
Anything else you wanna try?

792
00:40:42,336 --> 00:40:44,442
- What about a set
 of sharp scissors?

793
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:47,928
- Bring it on.

794
00:40:47,928 --> 00:40:50,206
I like a broad with a
 little spunk to her.

795
00:40:52,588 --> 00:40:55,073
[tense music]

796
00:40:56,971 --> 00:40:59,457
- Class dismissed, punk.

797
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,699
- What's this crap?

798
00:41:01,942 --> 00:41:03,150
- Leave the girl alone,

799
00:41:04,185 --> 00:41:06,187
or I might have to show you.

800
00:41:06,187 --> 00:41:07,016
- Yeah?

801
00:41:07,016 --> 00:41:08,500
Say, I'm real scared.

802
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,398
Tell you what, Tin Man,

803
00:41:10,398 --> 00:41:11,883
maybe I'll stomp
 the life outta you

804
00:41:11,883 --> 00:41:15,611
and your mighty dork and
 powder-puff ranger outfit.

805
00:41:15,611 --> 00:41:18,199
Then I'll get down to business
 with her while you watch.

806
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:19,442
Sound like a plan?

807
00:41:40,877 --> 00:41:43,535
I'm not messing around anymore.

808
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:46,262
If you don't clear outta
 here, I'm gonna cut her open.

809
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,403
I mean it!

810
00:41:49,403 --> 00:41:50,266
- I believe you.

811
00:41:51,647 --> 00:41:53,959
[fires gun]

812
00:42:12,495 --> 00:42:13,807
Are you okay?

813
00:42:13,807 --> 00:42:15,463
- I'm fine.

814
00:42:15,463 --> 00:42:16,603
I hope I'm fine.

815
00:42:17,707 --> 00:42:18,777
Am I gonna be fine?

816
00:42:20,123 --> 00:42:21,262
- I won't hurt you.

817
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,782
- What happened to Lance?

818
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:26,992
- Let's just say Lance
 is gonna have a long time

819
00:42:26,992 --> 00:42:29,477
to think about working
 on his social skills.

820
00:42:29,477 --> 00:42:30,306
- Hm.

821
00:42:31,514 --> 00:42:33,240
So I guess, um, you
 saved my life, huh?

822
00:42:34,275 --> 00:42:35,104
Who are you?

823
00:42:36,588 --> 00:42:38,279
The Masked Adventurer?

824
00:42:38,279 --> 00:42:39,108
Superteen?

825
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,386
- Just a friend.

826
00:42:45,459 --> 00:42:46,494
- Thanks, friend.

827
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:05,790
[tense music]

828
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:08,068
- So, the Earth creature
 that has stolen our arsenal

829
00:43:08,068 --> 00:43:09,517
is a student at this school.

830
00:43:09,517 --> 00:43:11,692
- And we have determined
that the arsenal itself

831
00:43:11,692 --> 00:43:13,487
is somewhere in this building.

832
00:43:13,487 --> 00:43:15,282
I say we disintegrate
 the creature now

833
00:43:15,282 --> 00:43:16,663
and possess our property.

834
00:43:16,663 --> 00:43:18,975
- We no longer have the
element of surprise,

835
00:43:18,975 --> 00:43:20,943
the creatures know our faces.

836
00:43:20,943 --> 00:43:23,117
Either we act now
 or we stay hidden.

837
00:43:23,117 --> 00:43:26,086
- If we strike now, it will
 draw too much attention to us.

838
00:43:26,086 --> 00:43:28,571
We must wait for
the proper time.

839
00:43:28,571 --> 00:43:30,815
And we must find the arsenal.

840
00:43:30,815 --> 00:43:33,507
[tracker beeps]

841
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,858
It appears someone
 has found it for us.

842
00:43:41,066 --> 00:43:42,827
- I wish I knew who
 was under that mask.

843
00:43:42,827 --> 00:43:45,277
[door opens]

844
00:43:58,808 --> 00:44:00,741
- Sweet creamery butter.

[tracker beeps]

846
00:44:33,084 --> 00:44:35,914
There's not supposed to
be a bomb shelter here.

847
00:44:41,644 --> 00:44:43,681
Now I don't know
 what kinda wacky weed

848
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,993
you three juvenile
 delinquents have been smoking,

849
00:44:45,993 --> 00:44:48,720
but this here is, A,
 a construction site

850
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,549
and, B, my classroom,

851
00:44:50,549 --> 00:44:52,724
you do not waltz
 your butts down here

852
00:44:52,724 --> 00:44:53,932
anytime you feel like it!

853
00:44:53,932 --> 00:44:56,452
- We require access
 to this chamber.

854
00:44:56,452 --> 00:44:57,764
- Please step aside.

855
00:44:58,661 --> 00:45:00,698
[Mr. Lipkis scoffs]

856
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,527
- Step aside?

00:45:02,527 --> 00:45:03,942
[Mr. Lipkis chuckles]

858
00:45:03,942 --> 00:45:06,324
I am gonna slap
 you three hooligans

859
00:45:06,324 --> 00:45:08,119
in detention for so long,

860
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:09,327
by the time you get out,

861
00:45:09,327 --> 00:45:11,709
you'll be able to
collect social security!

862
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,883
What do you think of
 them little green apples?

863
00:45:13,883 --> 00:45:16,575
- The time for conversing
 with this creature is over.

864
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,621
- Who in the Wide World
of Sports are you?

865
00:45:38,114 --> 00:45:40,013

[fires gun]

869
00:46:01,241 --> 00:46:02,690
- The weapons are gone,

870
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:05,176
the miserable Earth creatures
 have stolen everything.

871
00:46:05,176 --> 00:46:06,625
- Not everything.

872
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:08,179
- [Phil] The Armageddon device.

873
00:46:08,179 --> 00:46:10,353
- But they have stolen
 its power source.

874
00:46:10,353 --> 00:46:11,769
And the retrograde counter shows

875
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,701
we have little over
 a day to retrieve it

876
00:46:13,701 --> 00:46:14,944
before the stars are aligned

877
00:46:14,944 --> 00:46:17,050
for the force download
 from our home planet.

878
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:18,914
- It is of no concern.

879
00:46:18,914 --> 00:46:20,743
We will retrieve
 our property shortly

880
00:46:20,743 --> 00:46:22,227
and commence with our plans.

881
00:46:22,227 --> 00:46:23,263
- But how?

882
00:46:23,263 --> 00:46:24,436
- Leave that to me.

883
00:46:35,206 --> 00:46:36,552
- Captain Cosmo.

884
00:46:38,554 --> 00:46:41,039
Now I really am Captain Cosmo.

885
00:46:45,078 --> 00:46:47,597
[tense music]

886
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:51,567
And here's my
 chance to prove it.

887
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,018
- Fill it up!

888
00:46:54,018 --> 00:46:54,950
And I don't mean with
 that chump change

889
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,399
you got in that register.

890
00:46:56,399 --> 00:47:01,163
- We only have a couple
 hundred dollars in the diner,

891
00:47:01,784 --> 00:47:02,785
it's policy.

892
00:47:02,785 --> 00:47:04,269
- Don't lie to me!

893
00:47:04,269 --> 00:47:06,824
- Just do what he says, I
 think he means business.

894
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,964
- You guys got a secret wall
 safe behind the counter,

895
00:47:08,964 --> 00:47:09,827
I seen it!

896
00:47:10,931 --> 00:47:12,760
Now either you start
going for the real cash

897
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,486
or I'm gonna fix it

898
00:47:14,486 --> 00:47:16,799
to where you never need
to use Clearasil again,

899
00:47:16,799 --> 00:47:17,593
got me?

900
00:47:19,215 --> 00:47:21,735
[tense music]

901
00:47:24,496 --> 00:47:25,739
What the?

902
00:47:25,739 --> 00:47:27,396
- Pay for your corn
 dogs and get out.

903
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:29,916
It's closing time.

904
00:47:31,503 --> 00:47:33,126
- You're asking
 for it, dipstick!

905
00:47:34,748 --> 00:47:37,061
[fires gun]

906
00:47:44,102 --> 00:47:47,174
[electricity buzzes]

907
00:47:50,488 --> 00:47:53,077
[thug screams]

908
00:48:07,229 --> 00:48:09,887
- Call the police, he'll
be out for a while.

909
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,303
- I don't know who
 you are, mister,

910
00:48:12,303 --> 00:48:14,477
but you just saved my life.

911
00:48:14,477 --> 00:48:16,548
That creep was gonna kill me.

912
00:48:16,548 --> 00:48:18,343
- You're a real
 hero, you know that?

913
00:48:19,275 --> 00:48:20,104
- A hero.

914
00:48:39,986 --> 00:48:41,919
Guess I won't be
 needing you anymore.

915
00:48:54,862 --> 00:48:56,002
- Where is he?

916
00:49:02,146 --> 00:49:04,942
[dramatic music]

917
00:49:31,313 --> 00:49:32,141
- Hey.

918
00:49:33,453 --> 00:49:35,869
- What the hell happened to you?

919
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:37,112
- I sold some of my comic books,

920
00:49:37,112 --> 00:49:39,804
I decided it was time to
get some decent clothes.

921
00:49:39,804 --> 00:49:41,150
And I got contacts too.

922
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:42,669
- You sold your comic books?

923
00:49:42,669 --> 00:49:43,497
- Yeah.

924
00:49:43,497 --> 00:49:44,464
Pretty cool, huh?

925
00:49:44,464 --> 00:49:45,948
- [scoffs] Ralph,

926
00:49:45,948 --> 00:49:47,225
tell me you didn't really
 sell your comic books?

927
00:49:47,225 --> 00:49:48,778
I mean, you don't really
think that your problems

928
00:49:48,778 --> 00:49:51,057
stem from the fact that you
 didn't have any cool clothes?

929
00:49:51,057 --> 00:49:52,541
- No, I mean,

930
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:53,921
I just decided it was
 time to grow up a little.

931
00:49:53,921 --> 00:49:55,406
Anyway, you were
right, you know?

932
00:49:55,406 --> 00:49:57,097
I mean, the comic books
 were just holding me back.

933
00:49:57,097 --> 00:49:58,581
- Holding you back from what?

934
00:49:58,581 --> 00:50:01,584
From dressing like one of those
guys off of Dawson's Creek?

935
00:50:01,584 --> 00:50:02,413
- Hi, Ralph.

936
00:50:02,413 --> 00:50:03,931
- Hey, how's it going?

937
00:50:03,931 --> 00:50:05,761
[Baxter sighs]

938
00:50:05,761 --> 00:50:07,590
Girls notice me, Baxter.

939
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:10,455
I mean, I've spent three
years in this school,

940
00:50:10,455 --> 00:50:11,698
and none of these
girls would've given me

941
00:50:11,698 --> 00:50:13,562
the time of day in
 a watch factory.

942
00:50:13,562 --> 00:50:15,357
- Yeah, but this isn't you,

943
00:50:15,357 --> 00:50:18,015
it's like something you'd
 see on TV or in a magazine.

944
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,326
- Well, what do you
 want me to be, huh?

945
00:50:19,326 --> 00:50:20,603
A dork?

946
00:50:20,603 --> 00:50:23,054
If I was a dork, would
 that be okay with you?

947
00:50:23,054 --> 00:50:23,917
Hey, girls.

948
00:50:25,332 --> 00:50:26,782
[Ralph chuckles]

949
00:50:26,782 --> 00:50:28,956
Anyway, I mean, do you
honestly think I was better off

950
00:50:28,956 --> 00:50:30,372
when Monty, and Flash,

951
00:50:30,372 --> 00:50:31,787
and all those other
 clowns were picking on me?

952
00:50:31,787 --> 00:50:32,995
Or how about when I was

953
00:50:32,995 --> 00:50:34,065
sitting in the corner
 reading Spider-Man

954
00:50:34,065 --> 00:50:35,618
instead of asking somebody out?

955
00:50:35,618 --> 00:50:37,068
- No, see, I'm glad,

956
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:38,725
if you really wanna go out
there and make your life better,

957
00:50:38,725 --> 00:50:40,244
but this isn't
 making you better,

958
00:50:40,244 --> 00:50:42,729
it's just making you
some kind of big phony.

959
00:50:42,729 --> 00:50:43,764
I mean, do you want that?

960
00:50:43,764 --> 00:50:45,007
Do you want some
girl to like you

961
00:50:45,007 --> 00:50:47,044
because of some
 overpriced clothes?

962
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,493
- It's a start.

963
00:50:48,493 --> 00:50:51,117
- This is because of that
stupid stuff we found, isn't it?

964
00:50:52,428 --> 00:50:53,705
You know, I've been thinking,

965
00:50:53,705 --> 00:50:54,810
and if we're gonna
 use that stuff

966
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:56,018
just to make ourselves popular

967
00:50:56,018 --> 00:50:56,984
at Mount Limbaugh High School,

968
00:50:56,984 --> 00:50:58,365
then we're pretty pathetic.

969
00:50:58,365 --> 00:50:59,677
I mean, there's a
 whole world out there

970
00:50:59,677 --> 00:51:01,127
that could use this stuff,

971
00:51:01,127 --> 00:51:03,198
we could do really great things
with the suits and the guns.

972
00:51:03,198 --> 00:51:04,061
- Pathetic?

973
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,062
- Hi, Ralph.

974
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:05,993
- Hey.
 - Looking good, Ralph.

975
00:51:05,993 --> 00:51:06,925
- Thank you.
[Baxter scoffs]

976
00:51:06,925 --> 00:51:08,341
- Yeah, you're being pathetic.

977
00:51:08,341 --> 00:51:10,170
I mean, do you really think
 that Flash, and Monty,

978
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,689
and whoever else is
 popular around here

979
00:51:11,689 --> 00:51:14,485
got that way because of
 some magical superpowers?

980
00:51:14,485 --> 00:51:15,693
I hate to say it,

981
00:51:15,693 --> 00:51:16,832
but they got that way
 all by themselves.

982
00:51:16,832 --> 00:51:18,316
- Yeah?

983
00:51:18,316 --> 00:51:21,630
Well, I wasn't born with money
 or muscles like them, okay?

984
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:22,769
So if I gotta find another way

985
00:51:22,769 --> 00:51:25,392
to be somebody
 special or important,

986
00:51:25,392 --> 00:51:26,945
then so be it.

987
00:51:26,945 --> 00:51:28,671
- You can't use the weapons to
 make yourself popular, Ralph,

988
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:29,845
that's crazy.

989
00:51:29,845 --> 00:51:31,018
- Why is it so crazy?

990
00:51:31,018 --> 00:51:32,641
- Because first of
all, they're not yours.

991
00:51:32,641 --> 00:51:34,021
I mean, they're not toys,

992
00:51:34,021 --> 00:51:35,299
somebody made these
 things for a reason,

993
00:51:35,299 --> 00:51:36,783
and I don't think
 that the reason

994
00:51:36,783 --> 00:51:39,130
was for you to get a date
 with Felicia St. Clair, okay?

995
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:41,995
- Like I told you
 before, Baxter, the
 weapons are ours now,

996
00:51:41,995 --> 00:51:43,445
we can do whatever
 we want with them.

997
00:51:43,445 --> 00:51:45,032
- Well, you know what?

998
00:51:45,032 --> 00:51:46,241
You can keep mine, because I
 don't even want 'em anymore.

999
00:51:46,241 --> 00:51:47,794
- Why not?

1000
00:51:47,794 --> 00:51:49,071
- Because I don't wanna
 screw over Monty and Flash

1001
00:51:49,071 --> 00:51:51,384
and then turn out to be
just like them, okay?

1002
00:51:51,384 --> 00:51:52,385
- Hey, wait a minute!

1003
00:51:53,351 --> 00:51:54,490
Is that what you think?

1004
00:51:55,767 --> 00:51:57,424
- Just leave me
 alone, okay, Ralph?

1005
00:51:57,424 --> 00:51:59,012
Ah, oh, Monty, I'm really sorry,

1006
00:51:59,012 --> 00:52:00,876
I didn't see you there, I swear.

1007
00:52:00,876 --> 00:52:02,809
- Well, today's your
 lucky day, Thumbelina,

1008
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:04,293
'cause I'm gonna fix it

1009
00:52:04,293 --> 00:52:06,019
so you never have to worry
 about bumping into me again.

1010
00:52:06,019 --> 00:52:07,469
- Really?
 [tense music]

1011
00:52:07,469 --> 00:52:09,126
- What do you want, freak?

1012
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,265
You want me to give you a little

1013
00:52:10,265 --> 00:52:12,301
of what your dopey
friend here's gonna get?

1014
00:52:12,301 --> 00:52:14,131
- Where's your friends, Monty?

1015
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,444
It's funny, I don't see
'em around anywhere.

1016
00:52:17,444 --> 00:52:19,136
- All right, Ralph,
 you first then.

1017
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,655
- Yeah, go ahead
 and do it, Monty!

1018
00:52:21,655 --> 00:52:23,174
You might be able to
beat the stuff outta me,

1019
00:52:23,174 --> 00:52:24,451
but on the other hand,

1020
00:52:24,451 --> 00:52:27,178
I might end up beating
 you to a bloody pulp.

1021
00:52:27,178 --> 00:52:29,560
- You got a lotta
 nerve, dork boy.

1022
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,388
- Do I?

1023
00:52:32,287 --> 00:52:35,117
Let's get one thing
 straight, you preppy psycho,

1024
00:52:35,117 --> 00:52:39,535
if you ever even talk to
me or my friend again,

1025
00:52:39,535 --> 00:52:41,503
I will erase you.

1026
00:52:41,503 --> 00:52:42,745
I'm gonna do the world a favor

1027
00:52:42,745 --> 00:52:45,127
and take you right out
of the freaking program,

1028
00:52:45,127 --> 00:52:46,818
just like Chad and Lance.

1029
00:52:46,818 --> 00:52:48,406
Do you understand me?

1030
00:52:48,406 --> 00:52:49,373
- Yes.

1031
00:52:49,373 --> 00:52:50,236
- Yes what?

1032
00:52:50,236 --> 00:52:51,616
- Sir, yes, sir.

1033
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:54,067
- Good.

1034
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,346
- Ralph.

1035
00:52:57,346 --> 00:53:00,522
- That one, he spoke of
erasing his classmates.

1036
00:53:00,522 --> 00:53:01,661
Notice how he has changed

1037
00:53:01,661 --> 00:53:03,801
within the space
of a single day.

1038
00:53:03,801 --> 00:53:06,183
He has our arsenal,
 I am certain of it.

1039
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,046
It is time to obtain our ally.

1040
00:53:09,082 --> 00:53:11,567
[tense music]

1041
00:53:17,297 --> 00:53:20,438
- What? You three space cadets
 wanna take a poke at me too?

1042
00:53:20,438 --> 00:53:22,751
- We have been watching you
 for a couple of days now.

1043
00:53:22,751 --> 00:53:24,235
- We think you have potential.

1044
00:53:25,132 --> 00:53:26,996
- Great potential.

1045
00:53:26,996 --> 00:53:28,343
- Potential for what?

1046
00:53:28,343 --> 00:53:29,723
- It has come to our attention

1047
00:53:29,723 --> 00:53:32,139
that your comrades
 have disappeared.

1048
00:53:32,139 --> 00:53:35,488
- Lance and Chad, yeah,
 they just, like, vanished.

1049
00:53:35,488 --> 00:53:37,421
Their folks don't even
 know where they went.

1050
00:53:37,421 --> 00:53:38,663
- Your comrade
 Ralph has sent them

1051
00:53:38,663 --> 00:53:41,045
into a transdimensional
gateway flux.

1052
00:53:41,045 --> 00:53:43,289
- It is a low-grade
 anti-personnel weapon.

1053
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:45,429
It is highly effective
 with an enemy.

1054
00:53:45,429 --> 00:53:46,671
- You guys are
 nuts, you know that?

1055
00:53:46,671 --> 00:53:49,226
What do you want from me?

1056
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,848
- We may be able to
 offer you a chance

1057
00:53:50,848 --> 00:53:53,057
to exact revenge upon
 your comrade Ralph,

1058
00:53:53,057 --> 00:53:54,472
for disintegrating your friends.

1059
00:53:54,472 --> 00:53:56,543
- Disintegrating my friends?

1060
00:53:56,543 --> 00:53:57,786
- Yes.

1061
00:53:57,786 --> 00:53:59,822
- Well, what if I
don't believe you guys?

1062
00:54:01,755 --> 00:54:03,930
[buzzing]

1063
00:54:08,452 --> 00:54:09,970
- Ordinarily,

1064
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:11,696
we reserve such manual tasks
 as this combat and murder

1065
00:54:11,696 --> 00:54:13,422
to our worker subordinate class,

1066
00:54:13,422 --> 00:54:15,355
however, in this case,
 you will do perfectly.

1067
00:54:15,355 --> 00:54:18,600
- Oh, man, this is crazy.

1068
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,981
- We require your help,
we need a warrior.

1069
00:54:22,569 --> 00:54:23,674
- Where do I sign up?

1070
00:54:27,919 --> 00:54:29,611
- Hey, not bad.

1071
00:54:29,611 --> 00:54:30,819
- Thanks.

1072
00:54:30,819 --> 00:54:33,960
- When did you, uh, get
into comic-book art?

1073
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,926
- Comic-book art?

1074
00:54:36,134 --> 00:54:38,240
- Hey, have you seen
 Flash yet today?

1075
00:54:39,068 --> 00:54:40,760
- Nope, not yet, why?

1076
00:54:42,693 --> 00:54:44,004
- [chuckles] No reason.

1077
00:54:46,421 --> 00:54:47,870
- I wish I knew who you were.

1078
00:54:51,046 --> 00:54:52,772
- Sayonara.

1079
00:54:52,772 --> 00:54:54,705
Don't forget to read chapter 78,

1080
00:54:54,705 --> 00:54:57,570
on the Hogglespog-Scotch
Accord of 1817.

1081
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:59,572
It's just fascinating stuff.

1082
00:54:59,572 --> 00:55:01,953
And also, don't forget to
 get out those telescopes

1083
00:55:01,953 --> 00:55:05,681
for tonight's appearance
 of Jagalon Beta in the sky.

1084
00:55:05,681 --> 00:55:08,132
The Farmers' Almanac says
 it will reach perihelion

1085
00:55:08,132 --> 00:55:09,616
at exactly 11 o'clock,

1086
00:55:09,616 --> 00:55:11,169
so be sure to stay up for it.

1087
00:55:19,971 --> 00:55:21,456
Flash Gunderson?

1088
00:55:21,456 --> 00:55:23,216
What in Betsy's name
 are you doing here?

1089
00:55:23,216 --> 00:55:25,114
You're not in my class.

1090
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:26,530
- Uh,

1091
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:27,427
can I start?

1092
00:55:28,877 --> 00:55:32,225
- Well, while I can appreciate
 your newfound fashion sense,

1093
00:55:32,225 --> 00:55:33,985
I'm afraid it's highly
 against school policy

1094
00:55:33,985 --> 00:55:36,954
just to take a class for
 the gosh darn golly of it.

1095
00:55:36,954 --> 00:55:38,024
- But...

1096
00:55:38,024 --> 00:55:39,266
[Mrs. O'Houlihan sighs]

1097
00:55:39,266 --> 00:55:41,096
I need the grades,
 Mrs. O'Houlihan.

1098
00:55:41,096 --> 00:55:42,615
I need them.

1099
00:55:42,615 --> 00:55:43,788
- But why?

1100
00:55:43,788 --> 00:55:45,894
Aren't you on the football team?

1101
00:55:45,894 --> 00:55:46,722
- I quit.

1102
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:49,967
And you gotta help
 me with my grades!

1103
00:55:49,967 --> 00:55:51,209
- Oh, my goodness.

1104
00:55:51,209 --> 00:55:52,797
- Teach me.

1105
00:55:52,797 --> 00:55:56,629
I'll do my homework, I'll read
 stuff, I'll raise my hand,

1106
00:55:57,837 --> 00:55:59,045
just put me in the game.

1107
00:56:00,874 --> 00:56:03,360
- Have you been playing
without a helmet again?

1108
00:56:16,165 --> 00:56:17,650
- Thought I'd find you here.

1109
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:19,997
- Thought you didn't wanna
 have anything to do with me?

1110
00:56:19,997 --> 00:56:21,378
- Mind if I sit here?

1111
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,240
- Sure.

1112
00:56:25,071 --> 00:56:27,211
- Hey, Ralph, you
 got a light, huh?

1113
00:56:27,211 --> 00:56:28,419
[Ralph chuckles]

1114
00:56:28,419 --> 00:56:30,007
See, I knew you'd
 snap out of it.

1115
00:56:30,007 --> 00:56:31,491
I've known you for
 too many years,

1116
00:56:31,491 --> 00:56:33,942
and who else is gonna
 put up with you?

1117
00:56:33,942 --> 00:56:35,184
- You know, in the comic books,

1118
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:37,428
some guy gets bit by
 a radioactive spider,

1119
00:56:37,428 --> 00:56:39,741
or he shows up from
another planet, and bam,

1120
00:56:39,741 --> 00:56:41,294
you know, he's
 automatically a superhero.

1121
00:56:41,294 --> 00:56:44,055
He's fighting crime, he's
 got a secret identity,

1122
00:56:44,055 --> 00:56:45,332
it's all set in stone.

1123
00:56:45,332 --> 00:56:46,575
- Yeah, but this is real life,

1124
00:56:46,575 --> 00:56:49,233
things don't get set in
stone, they just happen.

1125
00:56:49,233 --> 00:56:50,717
And you get lucky
 and you're somebody

1126
00:56:50,717 --> 00:56:52,443
or you bust your
 hump your whole life

1127
00:56:52,443 --> 00:56:53,410
and then you're somebody,

1128
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,964
but nobody's a superhero.

1129
00:56:55,964 --> 00:56:57,724
You're always gonna be
some schmo with problems

1130
00:56:57,724 --> 00:56:58,967
just like the rest of us.

1131
00:57:00,106 --> 00:57:02,073
- I think we should
get rid of the weapons.

1132
00:57:02,073 --> 00:57:03,281
- Yeah, maybe we should.

1133
00:57:13,809 --> 00:57:15,086
- Hey, Ralph, Baxter.

1134
00:57:16,605 --> 00:57:17,986
- Flash, what are you doing?

1135
00:57:17,986 --> 00:57:20,298
- What you guys up
 to, eating lunch?

1136
00:57:20,298 --> 00:57:22,991
- Uh, hi, Flash.

1137
00:57:22,991 --> 00:57:24,510
- Wow.

1138
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:25,994
- Well, hey,

1139
00:57:25,994 --> 00:57:27,340
I just wanted to come
 over and say hi, you know?

1140
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:28,824
Oh, hey,

1141
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:29,791
I just started an essay on
 the life of the dung beetle

1142
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:31,896
for biology class.

1143
00:57:31,896 --> 00:57:34,071
Bet you 10 bucks
 I'm gonna get an A.

1144
00:57:36,176 --> 00:57:37,661
- Flash?

1145
00:57:37,661 --> 00:57:39,490
- Hey, I just wanna say
 hi to the guys, you know?

1146
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:41,009
- Sure.

1147
00:57:41,009 --> 00:57:44,012
- Hey, I just got Dungeon
 Master 4 on my PC, it rocks.

1148
00:57:45,185 --> 00:57:46,290
And if you think you
 maybe wanna come over

1149
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:47,118
and check it out...

1150
00:57:47,118 --> 00:57:47,947
- Uh...

1151
00:57:50,777 --> 00:57:52,503
Not today, but thanks, Flash.

1152
00:57:53,711 --> 00:57:55,195
- Well, hey, that's cool.

1153
00:57:55,195 --> 00:57:56,231
I'll catch you later.

1154
00:57:58,647 --> 00:57:59,786
- Are you feeling okay?

1155
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:04,066
[tense music]

1156
00:58:04,066 --> 00:58:07,000
- Ralph, I'm scared.

1157
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,865
- Yeah, we definitely
 gotta take the stuff back.

1158
00:58:09,865 --> 00:58:12,143
Let's just put it back in
 the room in the basement

1159
00:58:12,143 --> 00:58:13,213
and forget we ever saw it.

1160
00:58:13,213 --> 00:58:15,112
- Yeah, sounds like a plan.

1161
00:58:20,186 --> 00:58:22,429
- We will execute
 our plans tonight.

1162
00:58:22,429 --> 00:58:24,293
I want our ally to
 follow these two

1163
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:26,261
and retrieve our power source.

1164
00:58:26,261 --> 00:58:29,402
- And it must be done
 discreetly, after school.

1165
00:58:30,472 --> 00:58:31,887
- You know,

1166
00:58:31,887 --> 00:58:33,993
I was watching The Phenomenon
 Factor on TV last night,

1167
00:58:33,993 --> 00:58:35,788
and the main guys
 found this spaceship

1168
00:58:35,788 --> 00:58:36,996
in a secret government vault

1169
00:58:36,996 --> 00:58:39,343
in a mountain in Sweet
 Valley, Wisconsin.

1170
00:58:39,343 --> 00:58:40,793
This could be the same thing.

1171
00:58:42,001 --> 00:58:43,623
- You think this stuff
 came from outer space?

1172
00:58:43,623 --> 00:58:45,591
- That's what I'm
 saying, maybe it is.

1173
00:58:45,591 --> 00:58:47,109
I mean, maybe, like,

1174
00:58:47,109 --> 00:58:48,870
the Incas buried it under
 the school or something.

1175
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:50,492
- But the Incas weren't aliens.

1176
00:58:50,492 --> 00:58:53,495
- No, but they, like,
 hung out with aliens.

1177
00:58:53,495 --> 00:58:55,877
Remember Chariots of the Gods?

1178
00:58:55,877 --> 00:58:58,914
- I think I can safely say that
the Incas were not involved.

1179
00:58:58,914 --> 00:59:00,640
- [sighs] Well, I was thinking,

1180
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,124
what if it was aliens,

1181
00:59:02,124 --> 00:59:03,401
and what if they
 were upset with us

1182
00:59:03,401 --> 00:59:04,575
'cause we took their stuff

1183
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,301
and they were coming
 back to get it?

1184
00:59:06,301 --> 00:59:07,889
- Whoa.

1185
00:59:07,889 --> 00:59:08,821
[tense music]

1186
00:59:08,821 --> 00:59:09,822
- [Baxter] I'm just asking.

1187
00:59:11,064 --> 00:59:12,376
- Well, I don't know.

1188
00:59:12,376 --> 00:59:14,551
Okay, one thing at a time.

1189
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:19,970
What's he doing here?

1190
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:21,454
- [Baxter] I don't know,

1191
00:59:21,454 --> 00:59:23,214
but I'm gonna guess he's
 not here for the nice view.

1192
00:59:23,214 --> 00:59:24,181
- Hi, kids.

1193
00:59:24,181 --> 00:59:25,113
How's it going?

1194
00:59:25,113 --> 00:59:26,701
- What do you want, Monty?

1195
00:59:26,701 --> 00:59:28,772
- You know, you two
 Kentucky-fried morons

1196
00:59:28,772 --> 00:59:30,221
had me going for a minute.

1197
00:59:30,221 --> 00:59:32,430
Ralph here slams me up against
 a tree and I'm thinking,

1198
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:35,951
"Geez, this guy's grown
himself some guts,"

1199
00:59:35,951 --> 00:59:38,954
but guys like you don't have
 any guts, do you, Ralph?

1200
00:59:38,954 --> 00:59:40,956
- I'm not afraid of
 you anymore, Monty,

1201
00:59:40,956 --> 00:59:42,958
so you can just deal with it.

1202
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:44,304
- Oh, I'll deal with it,

1203
00:59:44,304 --> 00:59:45,512
and while I'm at it,

1204
00:59:45,512 --> 00:59:47,135
I'm pretty much planning
on using your head

1205
00:59:47,135 --> 00:59:48,550
as a freaking skull keg.

1206
00:59:53,003 --> 00:59:56,075
[electricity buzzes]

1207
00:59:58,353 --> 01:00:00,320
You should see the
 look on your faces.

1208
01:00:01,321 --> 01:00:03,220
Big surprise, huh?

1209
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:06,119
Looks like I found out what
 made you a tough guy, Ralph.

1210
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:07,534
- That's not one of ours.

1211
01:00:07,534 --> 01:00:08,984
- See, I also found out

1212
01:00:08,984 --> 01:00:11,538
what you two little wimps
 did to Lance and Chad,

1213
01:00:11,538 --> 01:00:13,644
and I'm not happy, mm-mm.

1214
01:00:13,644 --> 01:00:15,163
- And what are you
 gonna do to us?

1215
01:00:15,163 --> 01:00:16,405
- Well, my new bosses told me

1216
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:18,580
I had to get a little
 info outta you two,

1217
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,961
and once I do that,

1218
01:00:19,961 --> 01:00:21,134
then I'm pretty much free

1219
01:00:21,134 --> 01:00:22,826
to make you wish
 you'd never been born.

1220
01:00:23,965 --> 01:00:25,552
When are you two gonna learn?

1221
01:00:25,552 --> 01:00:27,969
Nobody messes with me, nobody.

1222
01:00:32,145 --> 01:00:34,492
[fires gun]

1223
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,945
[fires gun]

1224
01:00:47,574 --> 01:00:48,645
- You okay, Baxter?

1225
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:49,473
- Yeah.

1226
01:00:53,753 --> 01:00:56,376
- Where are you buttheads
 hiding the alien arsenal?

1227
01:00:56,376 --> 01:00:57,170
- What?

1228
01:00:58,068 --> 01:00:59,069
Alien arsenal?

1229
01:00:59,069 --> 01:00:59,932
- You heard me.

1230
01:01:01,105 --> 01:01:02,659
- We don't know what
 you're talking about.

1231
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:03,660
- Yeah, right.

1232
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,316
Listen up, sports fans,

1233
01:01:05,316 --> 01:01:07,077
you don't tell me
 where the arsenal is,

1234
01:01:07,077 --> 01:01:08,319
then I guess I'm gonna have to

1235
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:10,287
string your guts
 all over this lot.

1236
01:01:10,287 --> 01:01:11,668
You like?

1237
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,084
- Hey, say hi to Chad
 and Lance for me.

1238
01:01:14,084 --> 01:01:15,188
[fires gun]

1239
01:01:15,188 --> 01:01:17,535
[beam ricochets]

1240
01:01:17,535 --> 01:01:20,124
[siren blares]

1241
01:01:22,644 --> 01:01:24,128
Oh, boy.

1242
01:01:24,128 --> 01:01:26,717
- Guess your little space gun
 doesn't work on this armor.

1243
01:01:29,755 --> 01:01:32,550
[siren nears]

1244
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:33,759
You got lucky.

1245
01:01:33,759 --> 01:01:36,209
Bring the arsenal to
 school at 10 tonight,

1246
01:01:36,209 --> 01:01:39,626
they want their stuff back,
 especially their crystal ball.

1247
01:01:39,626 --> 01:01:42,181
You try anything stupid
or if you don't show up,

1248
01:01:42,181 --> 01:01:43,527
I'm coming out to get you.

1249
01:01:50,879 --> 01:01:53,364
- We gotta split, Ralph, cops.

1250
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:57,817
- This is bad.

1251
01:01:59,336 --> 01:02:00,578
I haven't even seen Mr. Lipkis

1252
01:02:00,578 --> 01:02:02,408
and all the bricks
 are outta place,

1253
01:02:02,408 --> 01:02:03,581
so I'm gonna go
 out on a limb here

1254
01:02:03,581 --> 01:02:05,722
and assume that somebody
found this place.

1255
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,585
- So the stuff was
 made by aliens,

1256
01:02:07,585 --> 01:02:09,104
Monty has superpowers,

1257
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:11,589
and our secret room has
pretty much been busted,

1258
01:02:11,589 --> 01:02:13,143
did I miss anything?

1259
01:02:13,143 --> 01:02:14,661
[chuckles] Oh, yeah,

1260
01:02:14,661 --> 01:02:16,733
that part about us being up
 a creek without a paddle.

1261
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,424
[computer beeps]

1262
01:02:18,424 --> 01:02:21,496
Oh, and even better, there's
 only five slashes left.

1263
01:02:24,533 --> 01:02:28,296
Look, we figured out that
 slashes mean hours, right?

1264
01:02:28,296 --> 01:02:29,504
So if this is a clock,

1265
01:02:29,504 --> 01:02:31,437
especially one
 that runs by hours,

1266
01:02:32,645 --> 01:02:33,957
then it should turn
 over and start again

1267
01:02:33,957 --> 01:02:35,406
after 24 slashes, right?

1268
01:02:35,406 --> 01:02:37,167
- Maybe it's on alien time.

1269
01:02:37,167 --> 01:02:39,825
- No, it's on our time,
and it goes by hours,

1270
01:02:39,825 --> 01:02:41,827
and there's only
five hours left.

1271
01:02:41,827 --> 01:02:43,690
So if it's six o'clock now,

1272
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:46,141
then at 11, all the
 slashes are gone.

1273
01:02:46,141 --> 01:02:48,765
Dude, this isn't a
clock, it's a countdown.

1274
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,628
- What happens at 11?

1275
01:02:50,628 --> 01:02:53,390
- Well, remember what Mrs.
 O'Houlihan was talking about?

1276
01:02:54,563 --> 01:02:56,289
Jagalon Beta is
 supposed to be visible

1277
01:02:56,289 --> 01:02:58,395
in the night sky at 11 o'clock,

1278
01:02:58,395 --> 01:02:59,603
so whatever's going down

1279
01:02:59,603 --> 01:03:00,707
probably has something
 to do with that.

1280
01:03:00,707 --> 01:03:02,882
- So what do we do about Monty

1281
01:03:02,882 --> 01:03:04,401
and whoever gave
Monty the armor?

1282
01:03:04,401 --> 01:03:07,714
- It has to be those
 weird new kids.

1283
01:03:07,714 --> 01:03:08,957
- We're gonna have to
 come out of retirement

1284
01:03:08,957 --> 01:03:11,408
and use the weapons
 to fight these guys.

1285
01:03:11,408 --> 01:03:14,100
- No, Ralph, we have to call
 in the Army or something,

1286
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:15,722
we are so out of our league.

1287
01:03:15,722 --> 01:03:17,310
- We don't have a choice.

1288
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:20,520
If we don't stop Monty and
 whoever those new kids are,

1289
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:24,455
I don't even wanna think
 about what's gonna happen.

1290
01:03:34,293 --> 01:03:39,229
- "The financial structure and
 a pre-industrial democracy."

1291
01:03:42,232 --> 01:03:43,923
I just don't get it.

1292
01:03:49,032 --> 01:03:49,826
- Flash?

1293
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:54,485
What on earth are
 you doing here?

1294
01:03:54,485 --> 01:03:56,936
- Felicia. [chuckles]

1295
01:03:56,936 --> 01:03:57,799
Uh, hi.

1296
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:01,147
- Do you realize it's
 almost 10:30 at night?

1297
01:04:01,147 --> 01:04:03,184
I've been looking
 for you everywhere.

1298
01:04:03,184 --> 01:04:07,188
- I was, um, catching
 up on some studying.

1299
01:04:07,188 --> 01:04:08,706
[Felicia chuckles]

1300
01:04:08,706 --> 01:04:10,743
- You're in school instead
 of a party on Friday night?

1301
01:04:12,572 --> 01:04:13,988
Flash, what's going on?

1302
01:04:13,988 --> 01:04:15,679
- Can't you see how important

1303
01:04:15,679 --> 01:04:19,096
the political climate
 of the 1800s is to me?

1304
01:04:19,096 --> 01:04:21,754
- Listen, I think it's
 time you and I had a talk.

1305
01:04:23,066 --> 01:04:23,998
I don't know what
 happened to you

1306
01:04:23,998 --> 01:04:26,276
in the past couple of days,

1307
01:04:26,276 --> 01:04:28,105
and I'm really not
 sure I wanna know.

1308
01:04:30,107 --> 01:04:32,075
- I'm just getting
 my act together.

1309
01:04:32,075 --> 01:04:35,872
You know, knowledge is
 power, and all that stuff.

1310
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:39,392
[tense music]

1311
01:04:43,845 --> 01:04:45,467
- No sign of Monty.

1312
01:04:45,467 --> 01:04:47,228
- Maybe he's downstairs
where the weapons were.

1313
01:04:47,228 --> 01:04:51,749
- No, he's waiting up here
 somewhere for us, bet on it.

1314
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:55,546
- I think now would be a good
 time to check your locker.

1315
01:04:59,309 --> 01:05:00,551
- But I guess I realize

1316
01:05:00,551 --> 01:05:02,450
that we're just not
 right for each other.

1317
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,281
And there's someone else--

1318
01:05:06,281 --> 01:05:07,765
- You know what?

1319
01:05:07,765 --> 01:05:10,458
I am so glad that
 you said that, honey,

1320
01:05:10,458 --> 01:05:12,149
because I've been
 wanting to tell you

1321
01:05:12,149 --> 01:05:14,324
that I've sort of been
 looking for somebody

1322
01:05:14,324 --> 01:05:16,602
who fulfills my
 intellectual needs.

1323
01:05:16,602 --> 01:05:18,984
- Your intellectual needs?

1324
01:05:18,984 --> 01:05:21,365
- Hey, don't take
 this bad, okay?

1325
01:05:21,365 --> 01:05:23,850
I mean, we can
 still have a caring,

1326
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:25,922
nurturing, platonic
 relationship.

1327
01:05:27,026 --> 01:05:28,510
You know?

1328
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:29,753
- Right.

1329
01:05:29,753 --> 01:05:31,824
[tense music]

1330
01:05:31,824 --> 01:05:33,032
- Is the device ready?

1331
01:05:33,032 --> 01:05:34,827
- We have set it up in
 the arsenal chamber.

1332
01:05:34,827 --> 01:05:36,933
- When the two thieves
 arrive with our power source,

1333
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,556
we should eliminate them before
they cause us more trouble.

1334
01:05:39,556 --> 01:05:41,247
- That is what our
 warrior is for.

1335
01:05:48,737 --> 01:05:49,566
- Felicia?

1336
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:52,879
- I just heard somebody
 walking down the hallway.

1337
01:05:52,879 --> 01:05:54,329
- Oh, don't worry about it,

1338
01:05:54,329 --> 01:05:55,710
it was probably the night
 janitor, he let me in earlier.

1339
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:56,953
- It didn't sound like it,

1340
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,713
I'm gonna go check
 it out real quick.

1341
01:06:00,128 --> 01:06:01,026
- I'll go with you.

1342
01:06:08,205 --> 01:06:10,725
[tense music]

1343
01:06:18,767 --> 01:06:19,976
- No sign of him.

1344
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:20,977
- Maybe he forgot.

1345
01:06:26,568 --> 01:06:28,156
- No, [Baxter sighs]

1346
01:06:28,156 --> 01:06:29,847
he didn't forget.

1347
01:06:29,847 --> 01:06:30,676
- Oh, god.

1348
01:06:32,505 --> 01:06:35,370
- You buttheads hid the
stuff in your lockers?

1349
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:36,268
No imagination.

1350
01:06:37,752 --> 01:06:39,892
So now that my bosses
 have what they want,

1351
01:06:39,892 --> 01:06:42,791
I guess it's time for me
 to get what I want, blood,

1352
01:06:44,345 --> 01:06:45,346
lots of blood.

1353
01:06:46,485 --> 01:06:49,039
[Monty grunts]

1354
01:06:54,941 --> 01:06:57,599
[Baxter groans]

1355
01:07:01,396 --> 01:07:02,225
[Ralph grunts]

1356
01:07:02,225 --> 01:07:04,848
[Monty groans]

1357
01:07:06,608 --> 01:07:08,265
[Monty fires gun]

1358
01:07:08,265 --> 01:07:10,888
[Ralph groans]

1359
01:07:14,651 --> 01:07:17,240
[Ralph groans]

1360
01:07:30,667 --> 01:07:35,258
- Oh, my god, I think that
 alien looks just like Monty.

1361
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,403
[fires gun]

1362
01:07:49,996 --> 01:07:52,792
- [Phil] Now, bring us
 the power source now.

1363
01:07:52,792 --> 01:07:53,793
- You got it, boss.

1364
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:05,909
Don't even think about following
me, you freaking losers,

1365
01:08:05,909 --> 01:08:08,670
or I'm gonna fry the jock and
 your little girlfriend here.

1366
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:11,294
- Hey, I swear, I'll
 do that extra credit.

1367
01:08:11,294 --> 01:08:12,122
- Move it!

1368
01:08:12,122 --> 01:08:13,089
Come on, let's go!

1369
01:08:26,274 --> 01:08:27,241
- You okay, Ralph?

1370
01:08:51,437 --> 01:08:53,819
[punches locker]

1371
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:55,648
- My arm has lost
 its superpowers.

1372
01:08:55,648 --> 01:08:58,237
- Oh, that's okay, I think
 I'm still good to go here.

1373
01:09:02,966 --> 01:09:03,794
[sighs] Uh-oh.

1374
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:07,971
- Monty must've damaged your
 power supply during the fight.

1375
01:09:10,042 --> 01:09:11,250
- What are you doing?

1376
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:13,218
- It's 10:40 now,

1377
01:09:13,218 --> 01:09:16,117
that star thing we were talking
about happens in 20 minutes,

1378
01:09:16,117 --> 01:09:17,601
so I gotta find Monty

1379
01:09:17,601 --> 01:09:18,878
before he does something
 bad to Flash and Felicia.

1380
01:09:18,878 --> 01:09:21,157
- Yeah, well, we're
about an hour past bad.

1381
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:23,642
[tense music]

1382
01:09:34,929 --> 01:09:37,380
- Why have you brought
 these two humans with you?

1383
01:09:38,553 --> 01:09:40,176
- Who are you guys?

1384
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,868
- I had to take these two
 pep-squad rejects hostage.

1385
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,840
[goggles power up]

1386
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,188
- Anyway, this still works.

1387
01:09:53,603 --> 01:09:54,914
We're gonna have to use
 these to find those guys.

1388
01:09:54,914 --> 01:09:57,503
They could be anywhere
 in the building.

1389
01:09:59,229 --> 01:10:01,162
- Man, we're totally tapped.

1390
01:10:02,888 --> 01:10:06,581
- Listen, you go one way
and I'll go the other,

1391
01:10:06,581 --> 01:10:07,962
we can use the goggles

1392
01:10:07,962 --> 01:10:09,205
to look through the
 classrooms to find those guys,

1393
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,034
and we'll keep in touch
on the communicators.

1394
01:10:11,034 --> 01:10:12,277
- What about the two thieves?

1395
01:10:12,277 --> 01:10:13,485
Did you eliminate them?

1396
01:10:13,485 --> 01:10:16,073
- Hey, you guys told
me to get my butt here.

1397
01:10:16,073 --> 01:10:17,868
Anyway, I ripped
 'em up pretty good,

1398
01:10:17,868 --> 01:10:20,043
their weapons and stuff
don't work anymore.

1399
01:10:32,849 --> 01:10:35,748
[goggles power up]

1400
01:10:40,995 --> 01:10:43,860
[goggles power up]

1401
01:10:45,758 --> 01:10:48,244
[tense music]

1402
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:03,017
- [communicator beeps] Ralph,

1403
01:11:03,017 --> 01:11:04,018
I've been up and down
 this part of the hall

1404
01:11:04,018 --> 01:11:05,261
and I don't see anything.

1405
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,780
- [communicator
 beeps] Me either.

1406
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:08,816
- What should we do?

1407
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,508
- Well, they probably
 went this way,

1408
01:11:11,508 --> 01:11:13,303
so chances are I'll
 see them first.

1409
01:11:15,926 --> 01:11:18,308
- [communicator beeps]
 Listen, I've got a hunch.

1410
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,621
- We only have a few minutes

1411
01:11:20,621 --> 01:11:22,519
until our home world
 is aligned with Earth

1412
01:11:22,519 --> 01:11:25,039
and we can download
 the Armageddon beam.

1413
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:26,489
- Give us the power supply.

1414
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:42,505
[communicator beeps]

1415
01:11:42,505 --> 01:11:44,230
- Ralph, we only have
 about five minutes

1416
01:11:44,230 --> 01:11:45,818
before Jagalon Beta's in view.

1417
01:11:49,581 --> 01:11:52,066
[tense music]

1418
01:11:57,865 --> 01:12:00,868
[electricity buzzes]

1419
01:12:08,634 --> 01:12:11,534
[goggles power up]

1420
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,161
[communicator beeps] I see them.

1421
01:12:18,161 --> 01:12:20,094
- [communicator
 beeps] Where are they?

1422
01:12:20,094 --> 01:12:21,233
- [communicator beeps]
 My hunch was right,

1423
01:12:21,233 --> 01:12:23,062
they're all in the arsenal.

1424
01:12:23,062 --> 01:12:24,270
[goggles power up]

1425
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:27,032
Monty, Flash, Felicia,
 and the new kids.

1426
01:12:27,032 --> 01:12:29,724
- At last, we may
 fulfill our destiny.

1427
01:12:29,724 --> 01:12:30,967
- [communicator
 beeps] And guess what,

1428
01:12:30,967 --> 01:12:32,762
something bad's
 about to go down.

1429
01:12:32,762 --> 01:12:33,935
- [communicator beeps]
 I'll be right there.

1430
01:12:33,935 --> 01:12:35,005
- We don't have time.

1431
01:12:36,248 --> 01:12:37,732
[exhales] I'm gonna go for it.

1432
01:12:59,236 --> 01:13:02,378
- Prepare for the elimination
 of all life on your planet.

1433
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:03,448
- Hey, wait a minute,

1434
01:13:04,897 --> 01:13:06,209
you guys didn't tell me you
 were gonna use this stuff

1435
01:13:06,209 --> 01:13:08,004
to kill everything
 on the planet.

1436
01:13:08,004 --> 01:13:10,524
- We are only interested
 in destroying human beings.

1437
01:13:10,524 --> 01:13:12,871
Since you lack any
 characteristics
 of a human being,

1438
01:13:12,871 --> 01:13:14,666
your life will be spared.

1439
01:13:14,666 --> 01:13:16,909
- Oh, well, that's cool then.

1440
01:13:24,503 --> 01:13:25,366
- Oh, hi.

1441
01:13:27,299 --> 01:13:28,783
Did I already miss everything?

1442
01:13:29,612 --> 01:13:30,647
- Have no fear,

1443
01:13:30,647 --> 01:13:32,166
in approximately three minutes,

1444
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:34,237
you will never have
 to see us again.

1445
01:13:34,237 --> 01:13:36,412
- Aww, you guys
 going on a long trip?

1446
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:39,484
- No, but you and the
rest of mankind will be.

1447
01:13:39,484 --> 01:13:41,831
[fires gun]

1448
01:13:49,528 --> 01:13:51,012
- Oh, boy.

1449
01:13:51,012 --> 01:13:53,463
- Comrade Monty, please
 take care of this creature.

1450
01:13:57,363 --> 01:13:58,157
- No.

1451
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:03,300
- Two minutes until our home
 world is aligned with Earth.

1452
01:14:05,579 --> 01:14:07,097
- [communicator beeps] Baxter?

1453
01:14:09,997 --> 01:14:10,825
Shoot.

1454
01:14:33,261 --> 01:14:34,331
- Comrade Ralph,

1455
01:14:35,747 --> 01:14:38,197
do you honestly believe
you can stop us now?

1456
01:14:38,197 --> 01:14:40,821
- Ralph, you saved me
in art class yesterday?

1457
01:14:40,821 --> 01:14:44,825
- Wait a minute, this Ralph
guy is from the planet Mandark?

1458
01:14:44,825 --> 01:14:46,343
- Let me handle this loser.

1459
01:14:46,343 --> 01:14:47,793
- Go ahead, Monty,

1460
01:14:47,793 --> 01:14:49,726
I already told you I'm
 not afraid of you anymore.

1461
01:14:54,559 --> 01:14:55,836
- You don't have any superpowers

1462
01:14:55,836 --> 01:14:57,354
to save your butt now, Ralph.

1463
01:15:00,737 --> 01:15:03,119
Guess you're gonna,
like, I don't know, die.

1464
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:15,096
Yeah, this feels great,

1465
01:15:15,096 --> 01:15:17,098
I haven't strangled
 anybody all week.

1466
01:15:19,135 --> 01:15:21,689
[Monty groans]

1467
01:15:25,728 --> 01:15:27,523
- You may have
 stopped Comrade Monty,

1468
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,663
but your fate is still sealed.

1469
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:32,389
It's time, activate
 the Armageddon device.

1470
01:15:34,806 --> 01:15:37,912
[whooshing]

1471
01:15:37,912 --> 01:15:39,465
- Not so fast.

1472
01:15:40,639 --> 01:15:42,883
- Foolish creature, that
device will not harm us.

1473
01:15:42,883 --> 01:15:44,436
- Maybe not,

1474
01:15:44,436 --> 01:15:46,611
but it'll do a number on your
 old crystal ball thingy there.

1475
01:15:46,611 --> 01:15:48,958
[fires gun]

1476
01:15:55,792 --> 01:15:58,795
[lightning strikes]

1477
01:16:05,181 --> 01:16:07,666
[aliens moan]

1478
01:16:20,023 --> 01:16:21,300
- I'll be back!

1479
01:16:32,415 --> 01:16:35,004
[upbeat music]

1480
01:16:36,177 --> 01:16:39,180
[computer beeps]

1481
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:41,320
[Ralph exhales]

1482
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:44,945
- Am I nuts, or did I
 just save the world?

1483
01:16:47,879 --> 01:16:49,156
- Yeah, you're nuts,

1484
01:16:50,329 --> 01:16:52,366
but you did sorta
 save the world.

1485
01:16:52,366 --> 01:16:53,609
- Wow.

1486
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:55,334
- I cannot believe it
was you the whole time.

1487
01:16:56,957 --> 01:16:58,234
You shoulda said
 something earlier.

1488
01:16:58,234 --> 01:16:59,718
- Why?

1489
01:16:59,718 --> 01:17:01,720
- 'Cause we coulda gotten to
 this part a whole lot sooner.

1490
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,140
- You know,

1491
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:10,764
that was a messed-up trick you
 and your buddy pulled on me,

1492
01:17:10,764 --> 01:17:12,662
I should just stand
 here for six hours

1493
01:17:12,662 --> 01:17:15,009
and beat your face into
a new, exciting shape,

1494
01:17:16,252 --> 01:17:19,082
but, that's the old me,

1495
01:17:20,083 --> 01:17:21,188
the new me has to get ready

1496
01:17:21,188 --> 01:17:22,776
for the big
 Math-A-Thon next week.

1497
01:17:22,776 --> 01:17:24,778
I'm gonna cream West
 Side High's butt.

1498
01:17:26,745 --> 01:17:27,608
See ya.

1499
01:17:29,403 --> 01:17:30,231
Oh, yeah,

1500
01:17:31,405 --> 01:17:32,648
you two are still
 invited to come over

1501
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:35,616
and play Dungeon
Master 4, if you wanna.

1502
01:17:35,616 --> 01:17:36,548
You too, Felicia.

1503
01:17:38,412 --> 01:17:39,240
See ya.

1504
01:17:44,073 --> 01:17:44,970
- You know,

1505
01:17:47,766 --> 01:17:50,666
I don't think I'm ever
gonna get used to that.

1506
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:53,599
[Felicia chuckles]

1507
01:17:56,085 --> 01:17:58,535
[bell rings]

1508
01:18:21,386 --> 01:18:23,077
- What do you suppose that is?

1509
01:18:25,493 --> 01:18:26,287
- I don't know.

1510
01:18:27,323 --> 01:18:28,704
Maybe an old bomb shelter?

1511
01:18:29,808 --> 01:18:31,914
If it ain't in the
plans, we tear it down.

1512
01:18:35,538 --> 01:18:36,781
- [chuckles] Hey,

1513
01:18:36,781 --> 01:18:37,989
[tense music]

1514
01:18:37,989 --> 01:18:39,507
here's a neat little doohicky.

1515
01:18:40,957 --> 01:18:41,786
Ain't it neat?

1516
01:18:43,995 --> 01:18:45,479
Ah, the kids will love it.

1517
01:18:45,479 --> 01:18:47,205
[construction worker chuckles]
 - Yeah.

1518
01:18:47,205 --> 01:18:48,620
- All right, guys,
let's get to work, huh?

1519
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:49,759
Let's get started.

1520
01:18:49,759 --> 01:18:52,762
- [claps] Let's go.

1521
01:18:58,595 --> 01:19:01,253
[computer beeps]

1522
01:19:05,982 --> 01:19:08,502
[tense music]

1523
01:19:24,587 --> 01:19:27,245
[intense music]
