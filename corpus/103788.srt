1
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,791
If anyone finds this letter..

2
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:19,796
it means that my plan didn't work..

3
00:01:20,421 --> 00:01:23,132
and that I'm already dead.

4
00:01:25,426 --> 00:01:30,431
But if I can somehow go back to the beginning of all this

5
00:01:30,515 --> 00:01:42,944
I might be able to save her.

6
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,196
Evan!

7
00:02:32,035 --> 00:02:33,912
We're going to be late again.

8
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:36,331
Since when do you care about going to school on time?

9
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:41,753
Don't worry, we've plenty of time.

10
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:45,924
Is dad going to come?

11
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:48,092
You know the answer to that.

12
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:49,886
Can he just come out for one day?

13
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:52,180
We've been over this a hundred times.

14
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:54,140
It's too dangerous for him.

15
00:02:54,057 --> 00:02:56,142
But Lenny said his dad is coming..

16
00:02:54,057 --> 00:02:58,228
and Tommy's and Kelly's Dad.

17
00:02:58,228 --> 00:03:00,313
Ok I get the point!

18
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:03,525
I'm not so bad, am I?

19
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:04,484
No.

20
00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:21,167
Ok! Have a good day.

21
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:24,379
I will pick you up later. Got to go.

22
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:26,464
Bye!!

23
00:03:29,926 --> 00:03:30,760
bye!!

24
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:35,765
Mrs. Treborn, I need to speak to you.

25
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,934
Can we just wait till tonight?
I'm already late for work and I...

26
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,727
I think you really need to see this.

27
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,107
Tommy! Leave Lenny alone!

28
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:47,652
Don't let me send you to Mr Voyteck office!

29
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,780
I was going to show this to the principal..

30
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:51,906
but I thought I'll talk to you first.

31
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:53,157
What is it?

32
00:03:53,074 --> 00:03:56,828
Yesterday, I had the child to draw whatever they wanted
to be when they grow up.

33
00:03:56,911 --> 00:04:01,291
Most of them made drawings of their parents.
But this..

34
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:13,386
I don't understand?

35
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,222
Evan did this?

36
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:19,142
Can I keep this drawing?

37
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:21,227
Of course.

38
00:04:21,102 --> 00:04:24,439
Umh..there is one more thing Mrs Treborn
I feel bad even mentioning.

39
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:25,607
What?

40
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:29,652
When I asked Evan about the drawing..

41
00:04:29,777 --> 00:04:32,071
well.. he couldn't remember doing it.

42
00:04:40,288 --> 00:04:41,956
I don't wanna go.

43
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:48,755
I don't like this place Mom,
it's creepy.

44
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:52,300
I promises I won't make any bad pictures.

45
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,514
We'll be fine OK.
He just want to do a couple to tests. That's all.

46
00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:58,765
You'll like him.

47
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,395
You're doing great.

48
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,815
Just tell me he has not
inherited his father's illness.

49
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,652
I'm sure the results will come back negative.

50
00:05:10,735 --> 00:05:13,863
But there is something else
you can do to monitor his memory.

51
00:05:13,988 --> 00:05:15,031
Anything.

52
00:05:14,906 --> 00:05:15,740
A journal.

53
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,034
Just get him to write down everything that he does.

54
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,202
And what would that do?

55
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,079
It could help to jock his memory.

56
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,873
..See if he could remember anything new the next day.

57
00:05:23,998 --> 00:05:26,501
This test result will come back in a few days

58
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:27,835
..and then we’ll take it from there.

59
00:05:27,752 --> 00:05:28,795
OK

60
00:05:29,003 --> 00:05:32,966
Today, mommy is taking me to play with Kelly and Tommy.

61
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:37,136
I’ll meet their father and see what a real dad is like.

62
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,307
Great! See you soon.

63
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,863
Evan!

64
00:05:54,737 --> 00:05:55,780
Evan.

65
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,700
What are you doing with that knife?

66
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,918
What happened?

67
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,086
Honey..

68
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:14,757
..what were you doing with that knife?

69
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,468
I don’t remember.

70
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:29,689
Hey Andre.

71
00:06:29,564 --> 00:06:31,232
George!

72
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:33,526
Hello little man.

73
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:35,945
Watch your steps.

74
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:41,451
Thanks George.

75
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:42,493
Not a problem.

76
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,287
Here’s my number at the hospital

77
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:46,372
..if there is any problem.
You know.

78
00:06:49,584 --> 00:06:52,712
You’re kidding! We’re gonna have a
great time today. Right sport?

79
00:06:53,254 --> 00:06:55,548
OK! Be good kiddo.

80
00:06:55,423 --> 00:06:56,466
I love you.

81
00:06:56,674 --> 00:06:57,300
Bye bye.

82
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,676
Bye George.

83
00:06:59,594 --> 00:07:00,637
Go..go on.

84
00:07:00,845 --> 00:07:01,888
Right at the back yard.

85
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,973
Here it comes.

86
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:08,561
Evan, Evan guess what? Dad got a new video camera

87
00:07:08,686 --> 00:07:10,355
..and we’re all gonna be in the movie.

88
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,732
That’s right Evan

89
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:13,900
..and you

90
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,360
..got to be the star.

91
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,903
I thought I was the star!

92
00:07:17,028 --> 00:07:19,113
Hey! What did I tell you?

93
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:22,325
Now Evan.

94
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,701
..you have to promise

95
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:27,247
..you’re the bestest super-doper promise

96
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:31,417
..that this will be our little secret.

97
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:33,586
Huh huh.

98
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,046
My boy…

99
00:07:43,721 --> 00:07:44,764
Where am I?

100
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,682
Where did we all go?

101
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,350
Calm down kid and stand still.

102
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,352
I was just somewhere else.

103
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:51,229
How did I get here?

104
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:54,649
Stop acting like some retard
or I’ll call your mother

105
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,820
..to tell her how a naughty
little shit you have been.

106
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,322
Kelly?

107
00:08:01,322 --> 00:08:02,991
Kelly>

108
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,119
What happened?

109
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,840
The good news is, the result is negative.

110
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,885
I found no evidence of legends,
hemorrhages, tumors..

111
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:23,761
There must be sometime you can work on?

112
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,013
If I were to guess

113
00:08:24,888 --> 00:08:28,016
..I’ll say the blackouts are stress related.

114
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,601
But he’s seven years old.

115
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,978
What kind of stress a seven year old can have?

116
00:08:32,103 --> 00:08:33,146
Plenty.

117
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:36,482
Maybe he has severe coping problem
of not having a father.

118
00:08:36,357 --> 00:08:41,571
You said the last time the blackout occurred
he was visiting his friend’s dad.

119
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,199
Well..

120
00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:46,576
he has been pushing me
to meet his father

121
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,161
..and I’ve been putting it off.

122
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,246
It’s worth a short Andrea.

123
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:53,041
We can arrange controlled meeting.

124
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,960
..some security,

125
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:59,297
Evan comes for a quick visit,
and with a little luck,

126
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:02,217
..no more missing father complex.

127
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:07,555
April fifteen.

128
00:09:08,598 --> 00:09:10,058
Today I got to meet my father.

129
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:13,061
His name is Jason and he’s crazy.

130
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,688
I hope he’ll let me call him Dad.

131
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:20,068
Dad lives here?

132
00:09:19,943 --> 00:09:22,445
Not in this wind. Actually no.

133
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:26,741
If you seems a little sleepy
it’s because of the medicine, OK?

134
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:28,201
OK.

135
00:09:31,412 --> 00:09:33,915
It’ll just be a moment.

136
00:10:03,653 --> 00:10:07,407
It’s OK I’ll won’t bite.

137
00:10:08,658 --> 00:10:10,535
You’ve seen pictures of me, right?

138
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,329
Uh huh. Mom says I have your smile

139
00:10:13,454 --> 00:10:15,748
..and your hair.

140
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:19,919
I’ll kill you!

141
00:10:22,213 --> 00:10:23,047
He’ll have to die!

142
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,132
It’s the only way!

143
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:26,050
Jason! No!

144
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:27,218
No!

145
00:10:31,181 --> 00:10:33,474
It’s gonna be alright
it’s gonna be alright.

146
00:10:33,474 --> 00:10:38,271
Come on. Let’s get him outta here.

147
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:39,522
I'm sorry Evan.

148
00:10:39,397 --> 00:10:48,364
..in certain hope the resurrection to eternal life
we command our mighty God, our brother Jason.

149
00:10:48,489 --> 00:10:52,660
May Lord bless him and keep him
The Lord make light to shine upon him,

150
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,248
..and be gracious onto him
..and give him peace.

151
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,499
Amen.

152
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:38,748
Come on, where is it?

153
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,500
I know it’s down here somewhere.

154
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,211
Tell me what shit, it’s so boring.

155
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:45,004
Ya, what are you looking for anyway?

156
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:45,922
Shutup loud ass.

157
00:11:46,256 --> 00:11:48,967
You hold your fucking horses.

158
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,301
It’s here somewhere.

159
00:11:51,469 --> 00:11:53,555
We should go though.

160
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:55,932
If Dad catch us smoking down here,
we’re dead.

161
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:57,308
Lets go.

162
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,313
I knew Dad has a blockbuster down here.

163
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:05,859
Lets blow the shit out of something.

164
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:17,620
Here you go buddy.

165
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:20,248
What dreaming man,
I’m not touching this thing.

166
00:12:20,331 --> 00:12:24,502
Anyone else would piss out, and nuts for sure.

167
00:12:24,502 --> 00:12:28,256
It can’t work this time buddy,
Look how small this fuse is. I’ll get killed.

168
00:12:28,256 --> 00:12:30,341
Not necessary.

169
00:12:33,469 --> 00:12:37,849
Here you go.
That’ll buy you two minutes, at least

170
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:40,059
Gee, thanks friend.

171
00:12:48,193 --> 00:12:51,946
Oh for Chris sake Lenny you moron
just do it.

172
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,045
You have balls man.

173
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,255
Shouldn't took you long enough.

174
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:38,243
What the hell, come on!

175
00:13:38,326 --> 00:13:39,786
Evan, you want to help me get him up?

176
00:13:39,994 --> 00:13:42,914
Evan, get your ass back here
and help me get him up!

177
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,290
What happened?
Where are we?

178
00:13:44,374 --> 00:13:45,833
Oh my God.
What are we going to do?

179
00:13:46,376 --> 00:13:49,712
Evan, come on! Help me!

180
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:50,839
Oh my God. How could we?

181
00:13:50,755 --> 00:13:52,423
Come on, lets go.

182
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:53,675
Lenny, what happened to you?

183
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,678
Fine, he’s going to be OK.
Everything is going to be fine.

184
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:59,722
What’s wrong with him?
Why is he not speaking?

185
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:01,057
Shock mdm.

186
00:14:06,187 --> 00:14:07,647
What is it? What happened?

187
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:11,192
We were just in the wood
building a fire when Lenny freak out.

188
00:14:11,192 --> 00:14:14,946
One minute he was OK and
then he just froze up. Right guys?

189
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:16,698
What happened Evan?
The truth.

190
00:14:16,614 --> 00:14:19,325
I dunno, I..I don’t remember.

191
00:14:19,409 --> 00:14:22,120
Something must have happened.
Something set him up.

192
00:14:22,036 --> 00:14:24,122
I blanked out.

193
00:14:24,205 --> 00:14:28,585
Don’t try to get your
blackout to get out of this one.

194
00:14:34,215 --> 00:14:36,926
You’re not making it up?

195
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,268
Breath in

196
00:14:45,268 --> 00:14:47,353
..and breath out

197
00:14:47,478 --> 00:14:48,521
..and relax.

198
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:51,524
You are completely asleep.

199
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:53,735
Relaxed.

200
00:14:54,652 --> 00:14:59,032
I want you to take me to the time when
you are in the woods with Lenny.

201
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,117
Think of it like a movie.

202
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:03,119
You can pause,

203
00:15:02,994 --> 00:15:04,037
..rewind

204
00:15:04,245 --> 00:15:07,582
..or slow down any details you wish.

205
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,878
Yes.

206
00:15:13,004 --> 00:15:14,881
Where are you now?

207
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:20,428
I’m standing next to Kelly,
my hands are over her ears.

208
00:15:20,428 --> 00:15:22,514
Are you hurting her?

209
00:15:22,805 --> 00:15:24,891
No, I’m protecting her.

210
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:29,604
OK. Lets move forward in time.

211
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:31,147
What do you see?

212
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:38,571
I see a car.

213
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:41,991
Yes Evan..tell me about the car.

214
00:15:43,034 --> 00:15:45,119
Go on

215
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:47,205
..nothing can hurt you

216
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,333
Remember, it’s only a movie.

217
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,335
You’re completely safe.

218
00:15:52,544 --> 00:15:53,795
I can’t.

219
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:58,800
The car vanishes, all of a sudden
I’m on the ground in the woods.

220
00:15:58,883 --> 00:16:03,888
The car isn’t varnished Evan.
The movie in your head is broken, that’s all.

221
00:16:03,888 --> 00:16:05,974
Tell me about the car.

222
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:06,933
I can’t.

223
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:09,018
It’s coming...

224
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:14,649
Hurry Evan, hurry!
It’s coming!

225
00:16:14,732 --> 00:16:15,567
Oh my God!

226
00:16:15,483 --> 00:16:18,611
On the count of ten, you’re going to wake up,

227
00:16:18,695 --> 00:16:20,154
..feeling your flesh,

228
00:16:20,071 --> 00:16:21,322
..and everything you talked about.

229
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:24,659
Make it stop!
One..you’re feeling awake.

230
00:16:24,534 --> 00:16:32,667
Two..you’re eyes are not feeling as heavy.
Five..six..come on Evan wake up! Nine..ten..

231
00:16:33,918 --> 00:16:35,587
God!

232
00:16:38,715 --> 00:16:41,009
What happened?

233
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:43,011
Did it work?

234
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,019
Thanks mom, see you later.

235
00:16:59,777 --> 00:17:03,531
Wake that sad eyes off your face
before you get busted.

236
00:17:03,531 --> 00:17:05,825
Did you see how Lenny’s mom
is looking at you?

237
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,619
Sorry.

238
00:17:12,207 --> 00:17:15,960
(Sign)…alright.
Does someone tell me what happened at the mailbox?

239
00:17:18,755 --> 00:17:22,300
Don’t you ever bring that shit up again
..not ever!

240
00:17:28,556 --> 00:17:29,599
Let’s go.

241
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:34,812
Are you OK?

242
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,539
Holly shit! Look at that fat fuck!

243
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:55,667
...

244
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,086
Shut up baggard.

245
00:17:57,961 --> 00:18:00,463
Who’s talking to you?

246
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:26,865
I’m sorry Kelly this is a really bad idea.

247
00:18:26,865 --> 00:18:31,035
You don’t really remember anything that happened?

248
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,329
You’re so lucky.

249
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:37,584
Look, everything is going to be OK.
Lenny will be fine..you’re see.

250
00:18:40,003 --> 00:18:41,045
Sorry.

251
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,339
It’s not your fault.

252
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:46,968
It’s Kagan called Dad and blamed
us for what happened to Lenny.

253
00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:48,344
Your Dad did that?

254
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:50,305
I deserve a lot worst.

255
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,681
What are you talking about?

256
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:58,146
What you deserve is a better father and brother.
What they do is make you feel like shit.

257
00:19:00,231 --> 00:19:03,985
You have no clue as to how beautiful you are,
do you?

258
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,747
What the fuck are you doing?

259
00:19:15,872 --> 00:19:19,209
Buying popcop, what the fuck are you doing?
Ops.....

260
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:38,895
Stop it!

261
00:19:38,895 --> 00:19:40,980
Stop hitting him!

262
00:19:41,105 --> 00:19:44,442
What’s wrong with you?

263
00:19:45,276 --> 00:19:46,736
Will somebody please help us?

264
00:19:46,736 --> 00:19:51,324
Now OK kid..you’re outta here.

265
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:04,754
Now another story. The peaceful town of BrayerVille
was rocked this afternoon
in the wake of an horrible act of vandalism.

266
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:10,927
While the police of upstate New York believes
this could be a simple case of
act of mischief gone array

267
00:20:10,927 --> 00:20:14,055
..the tragedy has definitely devastated the community.

268
00:20:14,138 --> 00:20:20,395
Now this is the grisly aftermath of an powerful explosion
believed to have been caused by an unknown quantity of dynamite.

269
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:24,691
Police has no leaks, no suspects,
and no motive for the...

270
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:43,543
Good night.

271
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:56,181
We’re moving.

272
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:18,995
Even Tommy is so pissed at me.
He knows I’m moving right?

273
00:21:18,995 --> 00:21:23,166
He’s acting real strange lately.
He don’t even look me at the eyes anymore.

274
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:26,419
Dart, here he comes.

275
00:21:31,716 --> 00:21:35,470
Did you mom says that Lenny is OK?

276
00:21:36,513 --> 00:21:40,058
It must be..I mean,
they let him out right?

277
00:22:04,374 --> 00:22:07,502
Welcome home.
Though you might to have some fresh air for a change.

278
00:22:07,377 --> 00:22:09,671
Tommy with you guys?

279
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:12,090
No..it’s cool.

280
00:22:21,975 --> 00:22:24,894
So what did you do in there?

281
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:28,773
It’s awful! Can’t sleep cause
everybody screaming all night long.

282
00:22:30,441 --> 00:22:32,527
I don’t want to go back.

283
00:22:33,027 --> 00:22:34,195
Did you see that?

284
00:22:34,195 --> 00:22:36,489
Ya...what’s with the smoke?

285
00:22:59,637 --> 00:23:03,183
Croquette!!
What are you doing with my dog?

286
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:09,647
Look at what you make me do!?

287
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:12,150
What the hell’s wrong with you?

288
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:28,833
Kelly! Come on, please wake up!

289
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:32,378
Wake up please!
Wake up!

290
00:23:32,462 --> 00:23:36,216
What don’t you fucking kiss her
you Price Charming.

291
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,650
How long was I out?

292
00:23:55,527 --> 00:23:58,238
Kelly, what’s wrong?

293
00:24:00,949 --> 00:24:04,494
ooh Croquette!!!

294
00:24:55,378 --> 00:24:57,672
I’m sorry.

295
00:25:26,951 --> 00:25:32,999
And time..put your pencils down and place
your blue books on my desk before you leave.

296
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:36,753
You too Mr. Nelson,
we’re all on the same time-zone here.

297
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:39,255
So how did do Evan?

298
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,091
I don’t know,
may get some names sorted out.

299
00:25:41,966 --> 00:25:45,720
Was it Pavlov that conditioned his dog to lick his nuts?

300
00:25:47,597 --> 00:25:50,099
You’re a major, wise-ass.

301
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:53,978
And how’s you project been coming?
You still planning to change

302
00:25:54,187 --> 00:25:56,481
..the way we humble scientists view memory differently?

303
00:25:56,356 --> 00:25:58,441
Don’t really have a choice.

304
00:26:27,971 --> 00:26:30,265
Jesus, must be truly an ass.

305
00:26:30,265 --> 00:26:34,227
Arlette, this is my well-mannered roommate, Evan.

306
00:26:34,227 --> 00:26:36,104
Ya..

307
00:26:36,187 --> 00:26:39,941
You’re the man that fuck up the grade
of a man at the anthropology final.

308
00:26:39,858 --> 00:26:41,109
See you later Tombeur.

309
00:26:41,192 --> 00:26:43,486
Bye.

310
00:26:44,445 --> 00:26:46,322
Ah...sweet girl.

311
00:26:46,197 --> 00:26:48,491
Here’s you shirt bro.

312
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:50,493
Sick fuck.

313
00:26:50,368 --> 00:26:55,582
Alright man, get dressed.
You’re taking me out.

314
00:26:55,373 --> 00:26:57,667
Why, you just make another mid-term?

315
00:26:57,876 --> 00:27:05,175
No. Better than that!
Seven years no blackouts.

316
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:09,053
Fuck you bro, let do this.

317
00:27:11,222 --> 00:27:12,265
Be gentle with me, be gentle.

318
00:27:21,024 --> 00:27:22,066
Nice.

319
00:27:24,694 --> 00:27:26,571
Look at that fucking guy.

320
00:27:27,697 --> 00:27:29,782
Fuck out of my bar.

321
00:27:29,282 --> 00:27:31,993
So which one of you have the pet worm?

322
00:27:31,868 --> 00:27:35,413
Worms..pural.

323
00:27:35,413 --> 00:27:37,499
Ah...that’s so gross.

324
00:27:37,499 --> 00:27:40,418
Talk to him about it.
He got the fetish.

325
00:27:40,418 --> 00:27:45,840
Watch it. That psychoon project
actually study how memory lost.

326
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,011
That’s explain for all the excitement that I had.

327
00:27:51,471 --> 00:27:53,348
Ten bucks says he’ll eat it out of the floor.

328
00:27:53,264 --> 00:27:59,521
Well, like to figure out how the
memory in the simple worm functions

329
00:27:59,521 --> 00:28:04,734
to help me understand the complexity
of the human brain.

330
00:28:06,903 --> 00:28:08,780
Let me take a shot.

331
00:28:16,287 --> 00:28:18,373
What the fuck weirdo?

332
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:29,008
Well, this not your game.

333
00:28:40,895 --> 00:28:42,355
Smell like a sex in here.

334
00:28:42,355 --> 00:28:46,109
Yeah..Tomber has a busy day today.

335
00:28:47,902 --> 00:28:51,447
You kidding. This is so big.

336
00:28:51,739 --> 00:28:56,536
Yeah? Well I guess charisma and I let it go all the way.

337
00:28:58,121 --> 00:28:58,955
You want a beer?

338
00:28:58,955 --> 00:29:00,415
Ya.

339
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:05,920
You got any incest or scent candles or anything?

340
00:29:05,503 --> 00:29:06,963
Wo..no..

341
00:29:15,096 --> 00:29:19,684
Most guys just put porn books under their bed
all you got are comp books?

342
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:22,937
Yeah..they’re my journals.
Something I begin since I was seven.

343
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,903
Read me something.

344
00:29:30,945 --> 00:29:35,116
Maybe I’ll get some fun out of this.

345
00:29:37,535 --> 00:29:38,786
Here we go…

346
00:29:38,786 --> 00:29:44,000
Looks like my mind refuses to believe what I’m seeing.

347
00:29:48,171 --> 00:29:51,508
..hearing Croquette make those awful screams.

348
00:29:58,181 --> 00:30:00,892
Just writing about it gives me the shivers.

349
00:30:04,729 --> 00:30:06,606
Come on. Go on.

350
00:30:09,943 --> 00:30:15,156
It was kinda like Tommy was possessed
or something.

351
00:30:15,365 --> 00:30:18,076
There was a hate in his eyes and…

352
00:30:24,749 --> 00:30:25,375
Are you OK?

353
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,093
Where am I?

354
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:38,930
What’s the hell is going on?

355
00:30:49,065 --> 00:30:50,525
I can’t get it opened.

356
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,068
Drop it!

357
00:30:52,068 --> 00:30:56,239
Or I’ll slick your mother’s throat
while she’s asleep.

358
00:30:59,993 --> 00:31:02,912
I get hold of Tommy...save Croquette!

359
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,462
Listen to me Evan

360
00:31:11,462 --> 00:31:12,714
..you listen to me good.

361
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:17,218
There is a million other sisters in the world
why do you have to fuck with mine?

362
00:31:21,472 --> 00:31:23,766
It’s OK, it’s just a dream.

363
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,897
Didn’t feel like a dream.

364
00:31:29,105 --> 00:31:32,025
Maybe because it never do.

365
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:36,404
So Gift Juan, you pass out on all your dates?

366
00:32:11,856 --> 00:32:12,899
Lenny?

367
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:14,776
I got a surprise for you.

368
00:32:14,859 --> 00:32:16,736
Never guess who’s here.

369
00:32:16,736 --> 00:32:19,239
Hey, it’s me.

370
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:20,907
Evan

371
00:32:56,568 --> 00:32:57,610
You’re working on

372
00:32:57,527 --> 00:33:00,446
..a model?

373
00:33:02,115 --> 00:33:07,745
Look ur..see that you’re busy so
I’ll try to make this quick.

374
00:33:07,745 --> 00:33:14,836
Remember that day at the junkyard
when we were kids?

375
00:33:15,753 --> 00:33:19,299
All I was hoping was you
can help me remember it.

376
00:33:22,343 --> 00:33:25,680
Just some details on how

377
00:33:26,723 --> 00:33:30,894
I couldn’t cut the robe.

378
00:33:30,768 --> 00:33:32,228
Ya.

379
00:33:33,188 --> 00:33:35,481
..that’s good.

380
00:33:36,524 --> 00:33:39,652
Anything else?

381
00:33:42,572 --> 00:33:46,117
Drop it or I’ll cut your mother’s throat when she’s asleep!

382
00:33:55,168 --> 00:33:57,670
Jesus Christ.

383
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:02,467
It really happened.

384
00:34:06,554 --> 00:34:08,431
Wow..er

385
00:34:09,766 --> 00:34:11,643
Make one peek,

386
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:16,773
..and I’ll swear you be last one fucker.

387
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:55,019
The last thing I remember before the blackout
I cup my hands over Kelly’s ears.

388
00:34:55,019 --> 00:35:01,276
I think I was more focused on her hands on mine
than on the mailbox

389
00:35:02,235 --> 00:35:04,737
..across the street.

390
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:19,335
Maybe it went out.
Someone check it?

391
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:22,338
Yeah, you do that Lenny.

392
00:35:30,471 --> 00:35:34,225
Be cool peek to be the last one fucker.

393
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:58,958
How is my sweet girl?

394
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,587
How is my sweet girl? You got the hic don’t you?

395
00:36:02,712 --> 00:36:04,797
You want to open it?

396
00:36:04,672 --> 00:36:06,758
You want to...

397
00:36:10,094 --> 00:36:10,929
Oh my God!

398
00:36:11,054 --> 00:36:13,139
Shit! Come on!

399
00:36:13,348 --> 00:36:15,642
Fuck, Lenny come on!

400
00:36:16,267 --> 00:36:17,727
Lenny come on!

401
00:36:17,727 --> 00:36:19,812
Come on Lenny lets go!

402
00:36:34,911 --> 00:36:38,873
Please man..fucking brutal.

403
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:43,044
Whata?

404
00:36:46,089 --> 00:36:47,131
Hello?

405
00:36:47,131 --> 00:36:49,008
Hello, who’s this?

406
00:36:49,092 --> 00:36:52,637
Ms Kagan, it’s Evan..Trebon

407
00:36:52,554 --> 00:36:54,639
I hope you know how much you upset Lenny.

408
00:36:54,722 --> 00:36:58,476
Yeah..I’m..look I’m really sorry about that..

409
00:36:58,476 --> 00:37:01,604
It took me over an hour to
clean up the mess you made.

410
00:37:01,521 --> 00:37:03,815
Can..can I just talk to Lenny?

411
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,401
Don’t call here.

412
00:37:13,283 --> 00:37:14,742
Mom.

413
00:37:16,953 --> 00:37:19,247
I can’t help it,
I’m just so proud of you.

414
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,790
Dad er..

415
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:23,918
Did Jason get good grades?

416
00:37:24,752 --> 00:37:28,089
He got straight As without touching the books.

417
00:37:28,214 --> 00:37:31,134
It’s one area where memory never fails him.

418
00:37:31,134 --> 00:37:36,764
Did he ever say like he figured out
a way to recall his lost memories?

419
00:37:36,764 --> 00:37:39,893
Years after the blackout happened?

420
00:37:40,935 --> 00:37:41,769
Why you asked?

421
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:45,940
No, I just figured being just a brain and all.

422
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:50,320
Looks like I would think that he would figure out
a way to remember stuff that he forgot.

423
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:53,448
Well, he was at your age,

424
00:37:53,323 --> 00:37:55,825
almost exactly at your age..come to think of it.

425
00:37:55,742 --> 00:37:59,287
..he said he figured out a way
he could remember his past.

426
00:37:59,162 --> 00:38:03,124
I could tell if they were real memories
or just his imagination.

427
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:11,257
Then, just before he got so bad,
he..um..has to be institutionised.

428
00:38:12,217 --> 00:38:14,511
He said he could...

429
00:38:15,762 --> 00:38:17,222
What?

430
00:38:17,222 --> 00:38:18,264
What?

431
00:38:21,392 --> 00:38:23,269
Look
What did he do?

432
00:38:23,144 --> 00:38:26,064
Forget it. It’s nothing.

433
00:38:27,232 --> 00:38:29,108
He was far to sick by then.

434
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:42,747
I didn’t want to be in the movie anyway.

435
00:38:43,164 --> 00:38:46,709
I was cold so I want to wear my clothes.

436
00:38:46,835 --> 00:38:48,294
But Mr. Miller took my shirt off..

437
00:38:48,169 --> 00:38:49,838
What the fuck are you doing?

438
00:38:50,046 --> 00:38:53,174
Shh..I need quiet for this.

439
00:38:53,383 --> 00:38:56,094
Are you stupid or what man?

440
00:38:56,219 --> 00:39:02,684
Maybe there is a reason why you repressed some pervert
who had you in his tidy-widy.

441
00:39:03,601 --> 00:39:05,687
I think twice about what you are doing.

442
00:39:05,603 --> 00:39:08,731
You could wake up a lot more fuck up than you are now.

443
00:39:08,815 --> 00:39:14,654
I’m fuck up than I already am.
You think you know me? I don't know me!

444
00:39:55,862 --> 00:39:58,364
No, it's my fault.

445
00:39:58,448 --> 00:40:02,827
Can you get through one damn day
without breaking something?

446
00:40:30,563 --> 00:40:32,232
Hey!

447
00:40:34,734 --> 00:40:36,402
Evan!

448
00:40:38,071 --> 00:40:41,616
Oh my God, it's been a long time.

449
00:40:42,575 --> 00:40:44,869
How've you been?

450
00:40:45,286 --> 00:40:46,746
Same know, you know..

451
00:40:46,746 --> 00:40:48,623
No, I don't know.

452
00:40:48,498 --> 00:40:50,792
Fill me in.

453
00:40:53,503 --> 00:40:56,005
Well..go on the state now.. all's good

454
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:59,467
..my mom's good.

455
00:40:59,551 --> 00:41:00,593
You want some?

456
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:03,638
No, now since I was kid.

457
00:41:03,721 --> 00:41:06,015
I quit like a hundred times.

458
00:41:10,103 --> 00:41:12,605
Are you walking home?

459
00:41:12,897 --> 00:41:14,148
Can I walk you?

460
00:41:14,148 --> 00:41:16,025
Sure.

461
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:19,153
My God.

462
00:41:19,362 --> 00:41:21,447
So

463
00:41:23,324 --> 00:41:25,618
..how's Tommy?

464
00:41:27,704 --> 00:41:31,875
Well they kept him in the Juville for a few years, but

465
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,502
..now he is working over at Dell's Autobody.

466
00:41:34,377 --> 00:41:36,462
That's cool.

467
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:40,842
Still live in with your Dad?

468
00:41:40,967 --> 00:41:41,801
No

469
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:45,555
I pay for myself at fifteen.

470
00:41:47,432 --> 00:41:49,726
Must have taken alot of courage.

471
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:52,520
Not if you remember my Dad.

472
00:41:55,565 --> 00:41:58,693
Can't you just move in with your Mom?

473
00:41:59,402 --> 00:42:02,947
No, she had a new family,
wasn't enough room.

474
00:42:02,947 --> 00:42:04,616
...whatever.

475
00:42:04,949 --> 00:42:08,703
Look, the reason why I came back is to talk to you.

476
00:42:08,786 --> 00:42:09,829
To me?

477
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:11,915
Why?

478
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:15,043
Well,

479
00:42:16,628 --> 00:42:20,590
..remember we were kids and
I used to have those blackouts?

480
00:42:21,007 --> 00:42:22,675
Ya, of course.

481
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:27,555
Some of those memories-
they're coming back to me.

482
00:42:28,598 --> 00:42:31,726
..and I just want to talk to you about just one particular.

483
00:42:31,851 --> 00:42:34,354
I try to remember.

484
00:42:38,608 --> 00:42:42,987
When we were kids, your Dad was making a movie

485
00:42:42,987 --> 00:42:46,324
..about Robin Hood, or something...

486
00:42:46,241 --> 00:42:48,326
What do you want to know Evan?

487
00:42:52,372 --> 00:42:58,211
Did he...what happened at the basement?

488
00:42:58,211 --> 00:43:00,296
Look, it was a long time ago.

489
00:43:02,382 --> 00:43:04,050
I know.

490
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:07,595
Is that why you came all the way back here?

491
00:43:07,387 --> 00:43:09,889
To ask about lots of
stupid questions about Robin Hood?

492
00:43:09,806 --> 00:43:10,849
No.

493
00:43:13,226 --> 00:43:16,145
I just think that something really bad might happen.

494
00:43:16,271 --> 00:43:18,356
Was there a point in any of this?

495
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:22,735
Look, whatever that happened wasn't your fault.

496
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:25,947
We were kids, and there is nothing we can do
to deserve what he has done.

497
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:28,032
Shut up Evan!!

498
00:43:28,032 --> 00:43:30,326
You're wasting your breath.

499
00:43:30,451 --> 00:43:33,580
You can't hate yourself because
your Dad is a twisted freak.

500
00:43:33,663 --> 00:43:37,208
Who are you trying to convince Evan?

501
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,919
You came all the way back here
to stir my shit just

502
00:43:40,044 --> 00:43:41,921
..because you have a bad memory?

503
00:43:42,005 --> 00:43:43,464
What? You want me to just

504
00:43:43,464 --> 00:43:46,593
..cry on your shoulder and
everything is all better now?

505
00:43:46,718 --> 00:43:49,429
Well fuck you Evan!

506
00:43:49,304 --> 00:43:53,474
Nothing is all better OK.
Nothing ever gets better.

507
00:43:57,437 --> 00:43:59,939
You know? If I were so wonderful Evan,

508
00:44:00,064 --> 00:44:01,733
..why don't you call me?

509
00:44:01,733 --> 00:44:04,861
Why did you leave me
here to rot?

510
00:44:21,753 --> 00:44:24,672
Well, he was at your age,
almost exactly at your age..come to think of it.

511
00:44:24,464 --> 00:44:28,635
..he said he figured out a way
he could remember his past.

512
00:44:31,346 --> 00:44:33,014
Some dude left a message for you.

513
00:44:32,889 --> 00:44:36,434
You can smoke all you want at the bathroom.

514
00:44:38,937 --> 00:44:40,605
Hi Evan this is Professor Carter.

515
00:44:40,522 --> 00:44:44,275
Just wondered why you didn't hand in your essay
this afternoon I was concerned.

516
00:44:44,275 --> 00:44:47,403
Call me to schedule a makeup.

517
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,617
What did you say to my sister
you mother fucker?

518
00:44:52,492 --> 00:44:56,037
Last night she cried on the phone for over an hour.

519
00:44:56,162 --> 00:44:58,665
She said you came and saw her last night.

520
00:44:59,707 --> 00:45:00,750
She...

521
00:45:00,959 --> 00:45:04,504
She fucking kill herself last night.

522
00:45:04,712 --> 00:45:06,172
She's dead.

523
00:45:06,589 --> 00:45:08,466
..and so are you.

524
00:46:27,587 --> 00:46:31,132
If the scar on my stomach
did'nt come out of nowhere

525
00:46:31,466 --> 00:46:35,220
..maybe my father wasn't
as crazy as I thought.

526
00:46:36,262 --> 00:46:41,059
If I can make scars,
do I have the power to heal them?

527
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:45,438
What about Kelly's scars?

528
00:46:49,609 --> 00:46:52,320
I wan't wanting to be in the movies anyway

529
00:46:52,403 --> 00:46:54,489
It was cold.

530
00:46:54,405 --> 00:46:57,534
So I wanted to wear my clothes.

531
00:46:59,202 --> 00:47:01,496
..but Mr Miller

532
00:47:01,371 --> 00:47:03,873
..took my shirt off.

533
00:47:14,843 --> 00:47:17,345
I got an idea.
Lets go down to the basement.

534
00:47:17,428 --> 00:47:21,599
Looked more like a dungeon down there.

535
00:47:22,642 --> 00:47:26,396
A little light here.

536
00:47:30,275 --> 00:47:32,360
Hey, what did I tell you about keeping the door shut?

537
00:47:32,235 --> 00:47:33,278
But I wanted to see.

538
00:47:33,486 --> 00:47:37,657
See the back of my fist in two seconds
if you don't do as I tell you.

539
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:46,749
Now, and this part of the story
Robin Hood had just married Maid Mariane.

540
00:47:46,624 --> 00:47:51,629
..and they have to kiss
and stuff like growups do.

541
00:47:52,046 --> 00:47:54,757
So, take off you clothes Kelly.

542
00:47:57,677 --> 00:48:00,180
Come on, like we take a bath.

543
00:48:00,096 --> 00:48:03,850
Don't make a big deal out of it.
You too Evan.

544
00:48:04,684 --> 00:48:08,021
Come on lets go, lets go!
We're making a movie here.

545
00:48:08,104 --> 00:48:11,649
Puts your hands on your ears Kelly.

546
00:48:13,526 --> 00:48:14,777
Which time is it?

547
00:48:14,694 --> 00:48:19,908
It's time for you
to do what I tell you to do.

548
00:48:19,908 --> 00:48:22,202
Wrong answer fuckbag!

549
00:48:22,076 --> 00:48:24,579
This is the very moment of your reconing.

550
00:48:24,704 --> 00:48:28,041
In the next thirty seconds
you're gonna open up one of two doors.

551
00:48:28,124 --> 00:48:32,086
The first door,
you forever traumatise your own fresh and blood.

552
00:48:32,086 --> 00:48:36,883
What's happending?
How are you doing this?

553
00:48:36,883 --> 00:48:42,722
It will change your daughter
from a beautiful child into an empty shell.

554
00:48:42,931 --> 00:48:48,561
..was her only trust was being
betrayed by her own sick pedophil father.

555
00:48:48,478 --> 00:48:50,146
Ultimately

556
00:48:50,772 --> 00:48:52,649
it will lead to her suicide.

557
00:48:52,732 --> 00:48:54,400
Nice work Daddy.

558
00:48:54,317 --> 00:48:55,360
Who are you?

559
00:48:55,568 --> 00:48:59,322
Lets say you are being closely watched George.

560
00:48:59,322 --> 00:49:02,450
Your other option is to treat Kelly like...

561
00:49:02,534 --> 00:49:05,453
..say a loving father treats her daughter.

562
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:07,664
So is that OK with you Papa?

563
00:49:09,123 --> 00:49:09,541
Yes.

564
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:13,503
Listen close you fuckbag.

565
00:49:13,503 --> 00:49:17,674
You screw this up again,
I swear I'll castrate you.

566
00:49:18,925 --> 00:49:24,973
What you need to do, is to discipline your son Tommy
cause the kid is one sadistic pop.

567
00:49:26,516 --> 00:49:29,227
A last thing.

568
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,154
Do'nt ever touch me again.

569
00:49:39,154 --> 00:49:41,447
No, I won't.

570
00:50:02,177 --> 00:50:04,053
Faster, faster..

571
00:50:06,764 --> 00:50:08,224
Croquette!!

572
00:50:08,224 --> 00:50:09,267
I will return to look for you

573
00:50:09,184 --> 00:50:11,686
Kelly I can't believe you came!

574
00:50:13,021 --> 00:50:15,315
..you got that one..

575
00:50:15,231 --> 00:50:17,317
Check out our new house..

576
00:50:25,658 --> 00:50:28,369
Honey, are you alright?

577
00:50:30,246 --> 00:50:32,540
Oh my god Evan, your bleeding!

578
00:50:32,624 --> 00:50:36,169
Kelly! it's..you.

579
00:50:38,588 --> 00:50:39,631
Incredible!

580
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,508
Thanks, go get clean up

581
00:50:41,382 --> 00:50:45,553
..and come back to bed.

582
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:49,098
Where are my clothes?

583
00:50:49,015 --> 00:50:51,935
These are your clothes silly.

584
00:50:59,025 --> 00:51:01,319
Bathroom?

585
00:51:05,073 --> 00:51:08,618
Hurry up, I want to get a picky before school starts.

586
00:51:46,447 --> 00:51:48,116
What?

587
00:51:50,118 --> 00:51:52,412
Unbelievable!

588
00:51:53,663 --> 00:51:58,042
I did'nt know you can get
so fascinated over a nose bled?

589
00:51:58,042 --> 00:52:02,005
Sorry, eh...I didn't see you.

590
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:06,801
Wait.. you're the girl

591
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:11,055
..with those guys that throw popcorn at Tumeour.

592
00:52:11,055 --> 00:52:12,098
What?

593
00:52:13,057 --> 00:52:17,437
..and your name is Gwen!
I know you.

594
00:52:19,314 --> 00:52:22,859
Seriously Evan, we have a go.

595
00:52:26,488 --> 00:52:27,530
Hi.

596
00:52:36,498 --> 00:52:39,209
Don't freak out if I ask you this but

597
00:52:39,751 --> 00:52:44,756
..did you remember the day your father
got that video camera?

598
00:52:45,256 --> 00:52:46,716
Ya..em..

599
00:52:47,675 --> 00:52:51,846
I think he had it like the first day,
and then he gave it away.

600
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:55,058
Why would that freak me out?

601
00:52:55,683 --> 00:52:57,143
I don't know.

602
00:52:58,102 --> 00:53:00,188
It's being weird.

603
00:53:00,271 --> 00:53:02,357
You are such a goofese.

604
00:53:04,776 --> 00:53:06,653
So I see you tonight.

605
00:53:06,528 --> 00:53:07,570
OK.

606
00:53:29,175 --> 00:53:30,844
Come on mom.

607
00:53:30,718 --> 00:53:35,098
Andrea, Evan and Chuck aren't home right now.
You know what to do.

608
00:53:36,766 --> 00:53:42,188
Hey mom, it's me...n Chuck.

609
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:45,650
I just called to say hi
I may call back.

610
00:53:49,904 --> 00:53:52,615
Hey Tumeour you know what time is now?

611
00:53:52,949 --> 00:53:55,660
What's the matter, you lost your Rolex?

612
00:53:55,743 --> 00:53:58,663
Fuck you frag boy!

613
00:54:01,791 --> 00:54:07,005
Remember everyone, there is only two more weeks
until your psy project is due.

614
00:54:07,213 --> 00:54:10,133
About the essay that I missed last week

615
00:54:10,133 --> 00:54:12,427
..you're still OK with the extension right?

616
00:54:12,427 --> 00:54:14,304
And you are?

617
00:54:14,429 --> 00:54:16,931
Evan...Treborn

618
00:54:17,015 --> 00:54:22,645
The answer is no Mr Treborn, please take your seat,
the exam is about to begin.

619
00:54:27,233 --> 00:54:31,613
Settle down everyone.
The exam will begin in 1 minute.

620
00:54:36,826 --> 00:54:40,788
Stop it asshole,
you got started on that shit.

621
00:54:40,997 --> 00:54:43,291
Evan you're hesterical.

622
00:54:44,459 --> 00:54:46,544
Did you study for this?

623
00:54:51,007 --> 00:54:52,675
We'll find out.

624
00:54:52,592 --> 00:54:55,929
Me neither.

625
00:55:05,605 --> 00:55:08,107
Holy shit. Are these the answers?

626
00:55:07,607 --> 00:55:11,569
Damn Evan, keep it on the down!

627
00:55:19,077 --> 00:55:23,456
I want to do something special
for Kelly tomorrow night.

628
00:55:23,456 --> 00:55:28,878
So if I said I need some help from you,
we're brothers.

629
00:55:28,878 --> 00:55:30,547
that didn't bother me.

630
00:55:32,423 --> 00:55:34,926
..it's a pleasure to do it!

631
00:55:35,218 --> 00:55:37,929
Ya...

632
00:55:38,054 --> 00:55:41,391
You may begin now!

633
00:55:58,074 --> 00:56:01,202
That was so good.

634
00:56:01,494 --> 00:56:03,163
Oh my God.

635
00:56:04,539 --> 00:56:08,501
Where did you learn that new trick?

636
00:56:09,127 --> 00:56:14,757
Why? It wasn't weird, was it?

637
00:56:14,632 --> 00:56:19,012
Ya if you call multiple orgasm is weird.

638
00:56:26,102 --> 00:56:27,979
Hello?

639
00:56:30,899 --> 00:56:33,610
Fuck em.

640
00:56:44,162 --> 00:56:47,499
What do you think it is about us

641
00:56:53,129 --> 00:56:55,215
I mean

642
00:56:56,341 --> 00:57:01,554
..why did you sneak out
to visit me after I moved away.

643
00:57:01,554 --> 00:57:03,640
Because I missed you.

644
00:57:06,142 --> 00:57:09,687
Why? You think my Dad
might stop me from seeing you?

645
00:57:09,687 --> 00:57:13,233
What you're going to do?

646
00:57:14,192 --> 00:57:17,529
Oh my god, my toes are numb.

647
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:22,742
Do you think that
we'll be together forever?

648
00:57:25,328 --> 00:57:28,039
That is the plan, isn't it?

649
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:31,376
Hell over high water?

650
00:57:31,584 --> 00:57:32,627
Ya.

651
00:57:33,586 --> 00:57:37,757
Ya. I was just making sure.

652
00:57:40,134 --> 00:57:43,680
Ya..that's the plan!

653
00:57:51,938 --> 00:57:52,981
Alright.

654
00:57:56,192 --> 00:57:59,320
All you rushes know what you need to do for me.

655
00:57:59,112 --> 00:58:01,197
Pleaches,

00:58:01,197 --> 00:58:04,742

00:58:09,122 --> 00:58:11,833
Are you kidding me?

660
00:58:13,835 --> 00:58:16,129
What? What did you say me?

661
00:58:16,004 --> 00:58:19,549
Give me the Greek alphabet.

662
00:58:20,592 --> 00:58:26,222
Alpha, silly, gamma, delta,.....

664
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:31,561
Do'nt fucking look at me.

665
00:58:38,026 --> 00:58:40,945

672
00:59:12,644 --> 00:59:14,938
I am not telling you.

673
00:59:22,862 --> 00:59:25,365
Oh my God!

674
00:59:33,081 --> 00:59:35,375
Wow.. it's beautiful.

675
00:59:36,084 --> 00:59:38,378
Go on, sit down.

676
00:59:38,503 --> 00:59:40,380
Thank you.

677
00:59:51,099 --> 00:59:53,810
Why are you doing this for me?

678
00:59:54,018 --> 00:59:56,729
When I woke up this morning

679
00:59:58,106 --> 01:00:00,024
..I saw your smile.

680
01:00:00,066 --> 01:00:03,194
..that smile.

681
01:00:03,528 --> 01:00:05,405
And I knew

682
01:00:05,697 --> 01:00:08,408
..that I want to spend the rest of my life

683
01:00:08,533 --> 01:00:10,827
..with you.

684
01:00:23,339 --> 01:00:25,425
I've been looking all over for you man.

685
01:00:25,508 --> 01:00:28,428
Someone trashed your car!
