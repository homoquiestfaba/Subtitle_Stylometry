00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,734
I never believed in

a cargo boat with hundreds
of smuggled Chinese migrants

20
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:10,084
was intercepted by the FBI
off of Rockaway Beach, Queens.

21
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:13,087
Chinese human smugglers,
often known as snakeheads,

22
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,622

Ah, so you think I'm unfair?

No.

He came here for the
same reasons you did.

95
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:19,473
But he betrayed me, my family,

she was adopted in New York.

You know, America
is tough, but look,

at least we have jobs here.

187
00:22:32,953 --> 00:22:35,256
Import-export
companies, truck drivers

188
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:38,259
and employment agencies
all depended on her.

189
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:40,727
For them, smuggling
was harmless.

190
00:22:41,896 --> 00:22:43,264
But everyone knew
this wouldn't last.

191
00:22:44,465 --> 00:22:46,367
If they kept quiet,
they got to eat.

192
00:22:47,401 --> 00:22:49,136
Even Rambo's girlfriend Sinh

193
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,071
got closer to the
operation every day.

194
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,275
Pai Gwut remained loyal.

195
00:22:57,278 --> 00:22:58,846
And no matter how mad he got,

196
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:00,014
no wrong respect Rambo.

197
00:23:03,284 --> 00:23:04,784
Everyone knew who fed them.

198
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:10,291
Alright, y'all
better put your hands,

199
00:23:10,324 --> 00:23:11,992
put your motherfucking hands up!

200

201
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:17,831
Shut up!

202
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:19,699
Shut up!

203
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:24,737
Thank you for coming.

204
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:29,043
My first birthday party
I've ever had in my life.

205
00:23:30,411 --> 00:23:32,112
I hate all of you fuckers!

206
00:23:32,146 --> 00:23:35,115
Not one of you visited
me when I was locked up!

207
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:36,116
So fuck you!

208
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:43,924
I wanna dedicate this
evening to the one woman

209
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:46,894
that means everything to me.

210
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:50,231
I love you, Ma.

211
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:53,334
That's my mom!
[guests applaud]

212
00:23:56,904 --> 00:23:58,505
I'm gonna sing you a song, Ma.

214
00:24:00,241 --> 00:24:01,542

- What the fuck?

215
00:24:01,575 --> 00:24:03,043
- You don't get to touch her!
- What the fuck?

[Zareeb] Your soba better.

223
00:24:18,592 --> 00:24:19,493
Let me help.

224
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:21,095
[Tse] No, I don't need help.

225
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:23,831
Come on, Sister Tse,
everybody needs help sometime.

226
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:27,034
[Tse] How long have you
been working for them?

227
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:28,869
[Zareeb] About
three years now.

228
00:24:28,902 --> 00:24:30,537
I was here before Rambo got out.

229
00:24:34,108 --> 00:24:35,409
What did he do?

230
00:24:35,442 --> 00:24:36,343
You didn't hear?

231
00:24:38,078 --> 00:24:39,413
His father was a drunk.

232
00:24:39,446 --> 00:24:42,583
Used to come home and
beat Dai Mah every day.

233
00:24:42,616 --> 00:24:45,185
One day Rambo grew
up, killed him.

234
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:48,922
Killed him?

235
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:51,425
The rest of the family's fine.

236
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:53,427
He's got a brother
on Wall Street.

237
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,429
Rambo's just the
black sheep, you know?

238
00:24:56,463 --> 00:24:58,065
So how much do you owe them?

239
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,302
53,200.

240
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:03,203
Wow!

241
00:25:03,237 --> 00:25:05,939
So when you were dreaming
of coming to America,

242
00:25:05,973 --> 00:25:07,908
did you think it was
gonna be this way?

243
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:11,578
I didn't think, I just came.

244
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:28,962
Hey yo.

245
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:31,098
Feed the pair fish with this,

246
00:25:31,131 --> 00:25:33,200
and then wipe down
all the condensation.

247
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:35,402
Our friends don't
like condensation.

248
00:25:37,338 --> 00:25:39,173
Hey, I know Ma wants
us to work together,

249
00:25:40,341 --> 00:25:42,276
so as long as you
listen to me...

250
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:43,143
Fuck!

251
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:45,346
Damn it.

Hey babe.

253
00:25:59,593 --> 00:26:01,195
Sup baby.

254
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:02,529
What's going on?

255
00:26:03,697 --> 00:26:06,033
So can you tell
me why she's here?

256
00:26:08,268 --> 00:26:10,003
I just needed some help.

257
00:26:10,037 --> 00:26:11,038
She needs the money.

258
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:15,409
Ma says she wants
her here anyway.

259
00:26:16,677 --> 00:26:17,478
Really?

260
00:26:19,346 --> 00:26:21,582
You see, this is
exactly what I mean.

Fuck you talking about, huh?

262
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,352
You know what the
fuck I'm talking about.

263
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:28,322
You should be a man.

264
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:32,359
Well you should
shut the fuck up.

265
00:26:34,995 --> 00:26:37,598
I ain't got time for this
bullshit today, all right?

266
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:40,534
This ain't fucking bullshit.

at, ding dong?

274
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:12,566
Yeah, getting better?

275
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:14,067
Good, good.

276
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:15,569
Where do you need to go?

277
00:27:15,602 --> 00:27:17,404
All right, no problem.

278
00:27:17,438 --> 00:27:18,705
Five minutes?

279
00:27:18,739 --> 00:27:20,207
Yeah.

280
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,443

281
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:23,343
Let's go.

[foreboding music]

283
00:27:25,012 --> 00:27:26,980
Are you not gonna get that?

284
00:27:27,014 --> 00:27:28,715
I like to hear it ring.

285
00:27:28,749 --> 00:27:30,317
It's the sound of making money.

286
00:27:37,357 --> 00:27:38,659
[Tse] People love Dai Mah.

287
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:41,094
For a price, she brought
their family here.

288
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:43,430
- Hey.
- Hey.

289
00:27:43,464 --> 00:27:45,432
[Dai Mah] Oh, oh, ah.

290

[speaking foreign language]

291
00:27:51,205 --> 00:27:53,373
But Dai Mah loved
money more than people.

292
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:57,144
Everyone knew where she was,

293
00:27:57,177 --> 00:28:00,080
because all roads through
Chinatown flow through Dai Mah.

294
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:11,425
[speaking foreign language]

295
00:28:19,233 --> 00:28:20,334
Everyone knows you.

296
00:28:21,735 --> 00:28:23,136
Yeah.

297
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,339
They know me and
they know my family.

298
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:26,206
They trust me.

299
00:28:27,608 --> 00:28:29,676
They're afraid
of you and Rambo.

300
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,345
Afraid?

301
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:34,114
There's a difference
between fear and respect.

302
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:36,383
Everybody loves Rambo.

303
00:28:38,318 --> 00:28:39,253
Whatever you say.

304
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:47,628
You know your firstborn
is always special.

305

I love all my sons, but

306
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:55,369
when Rambo was a little
boy, he saved me.

307
00:28:57,204 --> 00:28:58,238
What'd he do?

308
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:03,310
I was weak, he was strong.

309
00:29:03,343 --> 00:29:06,280
[somber music]

310
00:29:06,313 --> 00:29:07,815
Went to jail when he was 12.

311

He's spent more than
half his life there.

312
00:29:14,388 --> 00:29:18,225
What Rambo is
today, I'm to blame.

313

You know what it's
like to be a mother.

314
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:32,439
You see your faults
in your children.

You just wish you
had done better.

special, don't you, hm?

You're not.

00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:18,685
I need to get back.

320
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:20,320
Your mother hates
it when I'm late.

errand rat, you understand?

to clear my debt,

328
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:38,632
I had to find a
place in her family.

she doing here?

00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:46,239
[Dai Mah] She's gonna
deliver the food from now on.

333
00:31:46,273 --> 00:31:46,874
Trust her?

I got it, Ma.

337
00:31:54,681 --> 00:31:56,349
[Tse] There were
three safe houses.

338
00:31:56,383 --> 00:31:59,553
Each one had 10 to 20
migrants awaiting release.

339
00:32:00,721 --> 00:32:03,891
When a friend or relative
came to pay, they were free.

340
00:32:09,696 --> 00:32:12,299
There was always a lot of
cash at Eldridge House.

341
00:32:16,336 --> 00:32:18,605
The black Arowanas are a
little bit more aggressive

342
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:21,708
than the silver ones
because they like the PH

343
00:32:21,742 --> 00:32:23,310
more on the acidic side.

344
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:26,346

You think I'm weak, don't you?

You survive your way,

00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:15,649
I hate Diet Coke.

368
00:35:15,682 --> 00:35:19,053
Hey, I lost two girls
to Fathead in Los Angeles.

369
00:35:19,086 --> 00:35:20,720
Think I can get
another shipment soon?

370
00:35:20,754 --> 00:35:22,890
Don't worry about it,
we'll take care of it.

371
00:35:22,924 --> 00:35:26,961
You know I can't earn
if I ain't got no product.

372
00:35:28,062 --> 00:35:29,729
- Piece of shit.
- Hey.

373
00:35:29,763 --> 00:35:31,665
When we eat, we eat in peace.

374
00:35:31,698 --> 00:35:34,035
Tse-jia, what you
doing this weekend?

375
00:35:35,836 --> 00:35:37,838
- Are you serious?
- What?

376
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:41,266
You would crush her, Fat Boy.

377
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:43,844
Ma.

378
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:54,121
Go ahead.

379
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:58,125
You earned it.

380
00:36:08,803 --> 00:36:10,137
[Dai Mah] Smoking
in my restaurant?

381
00:36:10,171 --> 00:36:11,538
Nah.

382
00:36:11,571 --> 00:36:14,108

[singing in foreign language]

384
00:36:34,594 --> 00:36:35,495
[Rambo] Yo Jack!

385
00:36:37,131 --> 00:36:38,665
[Tse] Who are we meeting here?

386
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:41,035
[Rambo] Hey, your
place is not to ask,

387
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:43,703
your place is to follow, okay?

388
00:36:43,737 --> 00:36:46,639
[foreboding music]

389
00:36:48,142 --> 00:36:51,778
[Tse] Dai Mah was so rich
that Rambo never had to work,

390
00:36:51,812 --> 00:36:54,148
but he was a man, and
after 20 years in jail,

391
00:36:54,181 --> 00:36:55,782
he still had to prove it.

392
00:36:59,987 --> 00:37:01,155
[Jack] My man Rambo.

393
00:37:02,223 --> 00:37:03,858
- And you are?
- Oh, she's the help,

394
00:37:03,891 --> 00:37:05,725
don't fuck with her.

395
00:37:05,759 --> 00:37:06,894
We good?

396
00:37:06,927 --> 00:37:09,063
Got that red Arowana special.

397
00:37:10,264 --> 00:37:12,333
That's what I'm talking about.

398
00:37:12,366 --> 00:37:13,600
What do you say, huh?

399
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:16,703
You up?

400
00:37:23,944 --> 00:37:25,179
All right, every
three to four weeks

401
00:37:25,212 --> 00:37:27,348
you're gonna pick up
20 cases from Jack.

402
00:37:27,381 --> 00:37:30,117
Five boxes go to the
safe house on Eldridge,

403
00:37:30,151 --> 00:37:32,619
three in Flushing, and
the rest to Richie.

404
00:37:32,652 --> 00:37:33,320
It's easy money.

405
00:37:35,222 --> 00:37:36,756
Hey, where you going?

406
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,325
You better get one
of those boxes!

407
00:37:41,228 --> 00:37:43,797
Am I gonna have some
problem with you?

408
00:37:43,831 --> 00:37:45,698
This is stupid,
I'm not doing that.

409
00:37:47,168 --> 00:37:48,701
I'm not gonna smuggle drugs.

410
00:37:50,805 --> 00:37:52,306
The people are better, hm?

411
00:37:53,407 --> 00:37:55,810
At least I give people hope.

412
00:37:55,843 --> 00:37:57,178
You kill them.

413
00:37:57,211 --> 00:37:59,779

[child chatters]

415
00:38:28,675 --> 00:38:31,879
[Tse] When I clear my debt,
I will go to her.

416
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:39,086
But it felt like
I'd never get there.

417
00:38:48,262 --> 00:38:51,798
Even though I was close,
I was nothing to her.

418
00:39:15,956 --> 00:39:17,657
Zareeb, forgot the rice.

419
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:20,161
Can you get it?

420
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:21,228
Thanks.

421
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,751
Can you help me?

422
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:37,211
I need to get in touch with my cousin.

423
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:39,171
Do they have the money?

424
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:41,548
They are trying to get the loan.

425
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,966
Here. Call now.

426
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:44,009
Thank you.

427
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:47,787

00:39:47,821 --> 00:39:50,324
[tense music]

429
00:39:51,192 --> 00:39:52,092
- They shot Jin.
- Who?

430
00:39:52,126 --> 00:39:53,227
- Get the guns!
- Who?

431
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,428
[gun fires]

432
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:05,406
[gun fires]

433
00:40:15,015 --> 00:40:18,819
[Sinh] You survive your
way, and I survive mine.

434
00:40:19,954 --> 00:40:22,056
In the end, it's all the same.

435
00:40:23,524 --> 00:40:25,226
Hurry the fuck up,
go to the other room!

436
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:26,961
Hurry up, hurry the fuck up!

437
00:40:27,995 --> 00:40:28,629
Hurry up!

438
00:40:30,164 --> 00:40:30,998
[Sinh] Where's the money at?

439
00:40:31,031 --> 00:40:33,133
[Thug] Where the
fucking money at?

440
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:34,835
Where's the fucking money?

441

[grunts]

445
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:23,951
[Dai Mah] You okay?

446
00:41:25,286 --> 00:41:26,186
I'm okay.

447
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:39,166
[Rambo] How?

448
00:41:40,868 --> 00:41:41,568
Too loud.

449
00:42:10,431 --> 00:42:11,365
Chopsticks.

450
00:42:19,306 --> 00:42:20,307
Mm, watch.

451
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:26,213
[foreboding music]

452
00:42:31,585 --> 00:42:33,587
[sighs]

453
00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:38,092
[suspenseful music]

454
00:43:10,357 --> 00:43:11,358
Get rid of it.

455
00:43:13,193 --> 00:43:14,628
[Pai Gwut] B.B.'s dead.

456
00:43:14,661 --> 00:43:15,864
He was in the next run.

457
00:43:15,896 --> 00:43:19,333
[Dai Mah] We need another
snakehead for the Taiwan job.

458
00:43:21,001 --> 00:43:21,602
I'll go.

459
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:26,473
You're crazy.

460
00:43:28,475 --> 00:43:30,344
Why do you wanna go?

461
00:43:30,377 --> 00:43:33,247
Do you think I want to
fold dumplings forever?

462
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,349
I've done it once,
I can do it again.

463
00:43:38,018 --> 00:43:40,254
[ominous music]

464
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:41,622
Ma, she's not family.

465
00:43:54,201 --> 00:43:56,403
[Tse] If I go, she'll
cut my debt in half.

466
00:43:58,205 --> 00:44:00,140
You know they don't
really care about you.

467
00:44:00,174 --> 00:44:01,575
To them you're just like a cook.

468
00:44:01,608 --> 00:44:04,311
You cook bad, they'll hire
somebody else to do it.

469
00:44:05,746 --> 00:44:08,348
If you know a fast way
how to make money, show me.

470
00:44:09,616 --> 00:44:11,718
But is it worth the risk?

471
00:44:11,752 --> 00:44:14,321
Every day we're
here, we're at risk.

472
00:44:14,354 --> 00:44:17,057
We could go to jail,
we could get deported.

473
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:19,626
We could get killed
and no one would know.

474
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:22,296
So you tell me, is
it worth the risk?

475
00:44:33,307 --> 00:44:36,009

480
00:46:30,223 --> 00:46:30,858
Hey.

481
00:46:32,726 --> 00:46:34,829
So you are the
snakehead from New York.

482
00:46:47,015 --> 00:46:48,225
Where's my cargo?

483
00:46:50,435 --> 00:46:51,603
What's the rush?

484
00:46:51,645 --> 00:46:53,188
You are a long way from home.

485
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:54,439
Have a drink.

486
00:46:56,859 --> 00:46:58,986
I'm here to do a job.

487
00:46:59,027 --> 00:47:03,991
I miss New York. How's
Dai Mah? Paigwut?

488
00:47:04,032 --> 00:47:06,201
Is Rambo out of jail yet?

489
00:47:06,243 --> 00:47:08,954
He must be all grown up.

490
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:15,043
There's a typhoon coming
and we need to leave.

491
00:47:15,878 --> 00:47:17,087
Where are my people?

492
00:47:19,473 --> 00:47:20,474
[chuckles]

493
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:40,068
They all paid and are ready to go.

494
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:42,863
Hey! When are we leaving?

495
00:47:42,905 --> 00:47:44,865
We've been here for over three months!

496
00:47:44,907 --> 00:47:45,866
Shut up!

497
00:47:47,075 --> 00:47:48,035
Why do you talk so much?

498
00:47:48,076 --> 00:47:49,494
Whatever I tell you
to do, you do.

499
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,042
The ports will shut down
the ports tomorrow.

500
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:56,877
You can't afford to keep them
here another month.

501
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:00,130
Don't you think I know that?

502
00:48:03,091 --> 00:48:04,676
No. We leave tonight.

503
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:05,719
How?

504
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:11,058
If you follow me, I will
deliver you safe.

00:48:33,747 --> 00:48:38,544
From here, we take a container boat
from Taishan to Guatemala.

508
00:48:40,128 --> 00:48:43,757
There, a Coyote will smuggle
us north to America.

509
00:48:46,927 --> 00:48:51,932
Watch out for Cartel and Militia.
They own the border.

511
00:49:32,874 --> 00:49:34,674
Is that border patrol?

512
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:37,410
I don't know, but
it's time to run.

513
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,415
- Vamanos!
- Come on!

514
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:43,084

[Eagle] Eagle one here, I've
located about 20 illegals.

517
00:49:47,989 --> 00:49:49,924
They see the drone
and heading north.

518
00:49:49,957 --> 00:49:51,691
Can you handle them at
the river, Scorpion?

519
00:49:51,725 --> 00:49:53,828
[Scorpion] In my vehicle,
you can just guide me in.

520
00:49:53,861 --> 00:49:55,629
[Eagle] Look at them
all scatter like ants.

522
00:50:07,842 --> 00:50:10,077
[Eagle] Looks like they close
the doors into an old barn.

523
00:50:10,111 --> 00:50:12,312
[Scorpion] Copy
that, ETA five minutes.

524
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,487
Is this illegal shit?

525
00:50:21,155 --> 00:50:21,989

527
00:50:30,932 --> 00:50:32,834
- Time to go.

moving, group is moving.

[tense music]

530
00:50:44,678 --> 00:50:45,779
[Tse] Go, go, go!

531
00:50:45,813 --> 00:50:46,981
I see it to the right!

532
00:50:48,715 --> 00:50:50,483
Watch right there, go!

533
00:50:50,517 --> 00:50:51,919
Go faster!

534
00:50:51,953 --> 00:50:53,353
[Eagle] I see
them, I see them.

535
00:50:59,927 --> 00:51:01,361
It's militia.

536
00:51:04,932 --> 00:51:06,466
[Eagle] They're
gonna hit the riverbed.

537
00:51:10,204 --> 00:51:11,638
We gonna get them this time.

538
00:51:11,671 --> 00:51:13,773
Patriots Defense Recon, go!

539
00:51:13,808 --> 00:51:14,876
Drone needs charge.

540
00:51:17,611 --> 00:51:20,780
Copy that, Scorpion
engaging target.

541
00:51:21,816 --> 00:51:22,917
Easy, hands up.

542
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:24,085
Get your fucking hands up.

543
00:51:25,485 --> 00:51:26,954
What is this?

544
00:51:26,988 --> 00:51:29,190
Fucking chink and a wetback?

545
00:51:29,223 --> 00:51:31,691
This some kind of

00:51:35,462 --> 00:51:37,064
Get on the fucking grown now!

549

All the way!

550
00:51:39,666 --> 00:51:41,468
Open the fucking door.

You fucking open the...

Don't you talk
back, head down.

553
00:51:45,572 --> 00:51:48,541
Head down, don't look at me.

555
00:51:56,516 --> 00:51:57,517
Where's everyone?

556
00:51:58,585 --> 00:52:00,487
Where the fuck is everyone else?

557
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,655
[Coyote] They went back.

558
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:04,859
[Eagle] Scorpion, do you copy?

559
00:52:04,892 --> 00:52:05,960
We got nothing here.

560
00:52:07,094 --> 00:52:08,461
There's no one else.

00:52:17,171 --> 00:52:18,538
[Eagle] Scorpion.

562
00:52:21,175 --> 00:52:22,143

Ah, family.

570
00:53:53,633 --> 00:53:55,735
They never talk about family.

571
00:54:01,175 --> 00:54:02,709
I don't have family.

572
00:54:08,282 --> 00:54:10,284

Hello?

00:54:53,127 --> 00:54:55,329
Oh, Zareeb, I think
it's your cousin.

Hello?

580
00:54:58,298 --> 00:54:59,925

Thank you very much!
Thank you!

Come.

588
00:55:22,948 --> 00:55:26,285
Sister Tse, I know this
payment isn't enough.

589
00:55:26,326 --> 00:55:27,536
My daughter's been sick.

590
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:29,705
I promise I won't run.

591
00:55:29,746 --> 00:55:30,956
Can you give me more time?

592
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,801
Pay when you can,
you're not going anywhere.

593
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:37,963
Thank you, Sister Tse.
Thank you! Thank you!

594
00:55:42,968 --> 00:55:44,720
Do you like lobsters?

[Rosie's Mom] They wanna
know how you're doing there.

601
00:56:07,401 --> 00:56:09,736
[Rosie] I don't
wanna be on it.

602
00:56:09,769 --> 00:56:11,338
Then I told them just
because we live in Chinatown

603
00:56:11,372 --> 00:56:13,440
doesn't mean we
should burn our trash.

604
00:56:13,474 --> 00:56:15,876
[Rosie's Mom] Stop
being such a gentrifier.

605
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:18,412
Yeah, stop being a gentrifier.

606
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:25,386
They wanna talk to Rosie too.

607
00:56:25,419 --> 00:56:27,321
It'll be good exposure
for my clients.

608
00:56:28,822 --> 00:56:31,025
Oh shoot, I forgot the brie.

609
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:32,226
Gotta go back.

610
00:56:59,628 --> 00:57:03,590

Also, these guys I trust.

and daughter here.

620
00:57:45,674 --> 00:57:47,259
You should talk to Dai Mah.

621
00:57:47,301 --> 00:57:49,636
I don't trust Dai Mah.

622
00:57:49,678 --> 00:57:52,556
People are just cargo to her.

623
00:57:55,309 --> 00:57:57,728
This is my wife and child.

624
00:58:01,106 --> 00:58:04,568
I can help you, but Dai Mah can't know.

625
00:58:05,694 --> 00:58:06,695

think about Sister Tse?

Uh, I don't know.

631
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:33,881
She's cool.

632
00:58:36,617 --> 00:58:38,619
Why, you like her?

633
00:58:38,652 --> 00:58:39,553
[Rambo] Nah.

Okay, I got you.

[Tse] Where you taking them?

644

money, you did your job.

You're done here.

picking up your phone?

Ma, you know what
this bitch is doing?

You talking about
the massage parlor?

Hey, something funny, huh?

01:00:00,734 --> 01:00:02,236
She's fucking with my money, Ma.

Hey, you think
you're in charge?

I said do you think
you're in charge?

660
01:00:11,445 --> 01:00:14,281
Ma, I'm gonna kill
this bitch right here.

Refugees.

675
01:02:19,373 --> 01:02:21,675
Another country, higher
risk, more money.

676
01:02:24,778 --> 01:02:26,313
I want you to do it.

I don't think so.

I need to make sure
nothing goes wrong.

I want you to do it.

It'll be good for both of you.

684
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:19,433
Do it for me.

been following Tse-jia

What's she doing there?

691
01:03:56,503 --> 01:03:57,337
I'm not sure.

692
01:03:59,339 --> 01:04:00,307
[Rambo] Just
keep following her.

Hey ding dong!

[Rambo] White sting hauler can
go anywhere you want.

702
01:04:40,247 --> 01:04:41,314
I'll go check on them first.

703

What? No, no, no, we don't
got time for that shit.

We gotta drive all
night, let's go.

You have no idea
what it's like

706
01:04:46,687 --> 01:04:48,388
to be in a shipping container.

707
01:04:49,857 --> 01:04:51,291
Maybe we could
just go check, Bo.

708
01:04:51,324 --> 01:04:53,293
Maybe they gotta
pee or something.

709
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:57,397
Bullshit.

What is it, some bullshit?

Oh shit.

01:06:04,564 --> 01:06:05,732
Look at all the fucking
dead bodies, Bo.

728
01:06:05,766 --> 01:06:06,901
Man, get the fuck out of here!

729
01:06:06,934 --> 01:06:07,734
You come here.

730
01:06:12,339 --> 01:06:13,373

733
01:06:22,116 --> 01:06:24,518
There's 50 more kilos in here,
we'll find them in New York.

734
01:06:25,786 --> 01:06:27,354
[Pai Gwut] Bro, somebody
left the freezer on.

735
01:06:27,387 --> 01:06:29,957
Hey, we stick to the plan
and we drive back tonight.

736
01:06:29,991 --> 01:06:31,058
[Pai Gwut] How we
gonna drive back

737
01:06:31,092 --> 01:06:32,059
with all these things
back here, bro?

Fuck!

741
01:06:38,532 --> 01:06:41,002
Every single fucking
time because of you.

742
01:06:41,035 --> 01:06:42,904
Get your fucking
drugs, let's go.

743
01:06:42,937 --> 01:06:45,472
They showed up like this.
This ain't my fucking fault.

744
01:06:46,439 --> 01:06:47,440
Yeah it is.

745
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:52,079
You gonna fucking stand there?

746
01:06:52,113 --> 01:06:52,947
Let's go!

747
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,035
Hey.

748
01:07:18,072 --> 01:07:19,439
It's your cut.

01:07:29,783 --> 01:07:32,053
[Newscaster] 38 bodies
were found frozen dead

751
01:07:32,086 --> 01:07:34,554
in an abandoned
refrigerated smuggling truck

752
01:07:34,588 --> 01:07:36,123
in Queens today.

753
01:07:36,157 --> 01:07:38,159
Authorities have not
determined the origin

754
01:07:38,192 --> 01:07:40,560
of the immigrants,
but the DEA suspects

755
01:07:40,594 --> 01:07:41,996

756

[Anchor] The truck originated
from Toronto, Canada,

757
01:07:44,131 --> 01:07:46,533
and normally transports
frozen lobsters

758
01:07:46,566 --> 01:07:48,970
for Uncle Beth's Seafood
Company in Chinatown.

759
01:07:49,904 --> 01:07:51,906
The suspects are still at large.

01:08:10,724 --> 01:08:11,826
All my debts are paid.

763
01:08:13,127 --> 01:08:14,694
I can't work for you anymore.

764
01:08:16,898 --> 01:08:18,398
You know you're special.

765
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:26,573
Look, I didn't work this hard
for Rambo to fuck it all up.

766
01:08:28,109 --> 01:08:29,911
You saved me a fortune.

767
01:08:30,811 --> 01:08:32,746
I didn't do that for you.

768
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:33,881
I did that to survive.

769
01:08:33,915 --> 01:08:34,781
I respect that.

770
01:08:37,051 --> 01:08:39,519
What if I can offer
you something better?

771
01:08:41,188 --> 01:08:42,622
I'll double your pay.

772
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,062
And give you the dumpling house.

773
01:08:54,135 --> 01:08:55,002
People depend on me.

774
01:08:57,671 --> 01:08:59,840
When I'm gone, people
can depend on you.

Sister Tse, I'm worried about my family.

779
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:32,084
Last I heard they were in Montreal.

780
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:34,628
Don't worry. The van will come soon.

781
01:11:35,128 --> 01:11:36,463
Thank you.

782
01:11:36,505 --> 01:11:40,467
Dai Mah doesn't know about this.
Let's keep it that way.

783
01:11:40,509 --> 01:11:41,510
No problem.

What's going on here?

789
01:12:08,028 --> 01:12:09,029
They just traveled 8,000 miles

790
01:12:09,063 --> 01:12:10,131
and you're gonna
bring them here?

791

The fuck is wrong with you?

- No English.

794

Mei-Ying Tse?

795
01:12:30,151 --> 01:12:31,185
That is your name, right?

796
01:12:32,386 --> 01:12:35,156
I wanna ask you
about a snakehead.

797
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:36,723
Pearl Ho.

[foreboding music]

01:12:41,262 --> 01:12:45,266
It turns out your fingerprints
are all over the truck.

801
01:12:46,967 --> 01:12:49,303
You're gonna tell me all
about the frozen bodies.

802
01:12:51,138 --> 01:12:55,409
Or we can talk
about your daughter.

803
01:13:04,518 --> 01:13:08,189
Is your survival more
important than hers?

804
01:13:30,878 --> 01:13:31,879
All right then.

805
01:13:35,049 --> 01:13:39,153
Sister Tse, let's start
from the beginning.

806
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:48,761
When I was three, my
mother sold me for $1,000.

807
01:13:49,964 --> 01:13:50,965
I never blamed her.

808
01:13:51,932 --> 01:13:52,833
What could she do?

809
01:13:54,068 --> 01:13:56,203
How could anyone
blame a prostitute?

810
01:13:58,205 --> 01:14:00,507
I grew up hard
learning one thing.

811
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:01,741
Survival.

812
01:14:05,012 --> 01:14:06,380
My name is Tse Mei-Ying.

813
01:14:07,348 --> 01:14:09,283
But people call me Sister Tse.

814
01:14:13,053 --> 01:14:14,955
I never believed in
the American dream.

815
01:14:16,023 --> 01:14:17,825
All I knew was how to survive.

816
01:14:20,261 --> 01:14:21,962
For me and my family.

817
01:14:27,301 --> 01:14:28,869
Thank you, Dai Mah.

818
01:14:28,902 --> 01:14:29,970
We protect our own.

819
01:14:31,972 --> 01:14:34,908
Sorry we didn't get to you
earlier. These things take time.

820
01:14:50,624 --> 01:14:52,559
You've nothing to worry about.

821
01:14:52,593 --> 01:14:53,861
We're family.

Come on, I gotta
show you something.

824
01:15:08,075 --> 01:15:09,510
All right, this
better be good.

825
01:15:11,345 --> 01:15:13,113
There you go.

826
01:15:13,147 --> 01:15:13,981
Wait.

827
01:15:16,216 --> 01:15:17,051
Me?

828
01:15:17,084 --> 01:15:18,285
It's all yours.

829

Oh, Tse, you're amazing.

Wow.

01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:31,065
What?

833
01:15:34,134 --> 01:15:36,070
You know I worry
about you sometimes.

834
01:15:37,504 --> 01:15:38,972
What's there to worry about?

835
01:15:41,408 --> 01:15:43,377
You have more
than enough money.

836
01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:45,045
Why are you still doing this?

837
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:50,351
Enjoy this, okay?

838
01:15:58,359 --> 01:16:00,361
Did you hear what
Sister Tse did?

839
01:16:00,394 --> 01:16:01,995
She started
smuggling on the side

840
01:16:02,029 --> 01:16:04,164
and got caught by
the FBI, dumb bitch.

No, I need some leverage.

844
01:16:10,604 --> 01:16:12,639
Get me that little
girl she's been seeing.

845
01:16:13,974 --> 01:16:15,409
You want me to
kill the little girl?

846
01:16:15,442 --> 01:16:16,243
No!

847
01:16:16,276 --> 01:16:17,344
Just bring her to me.

856
01:18:25,339 --> 01:18:26,740
You might need a new job soon.

857
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:29,543
Work for you?

858
01:18:30,344 --> 01:18:31,612
Huh?

wanna play, huh?

I gave you everything and
treated you like a daughter

from the beginning.

883
01:22:41,561 --> 01:22:44,798
You mean a life of
slavery and violence?

884
01:22:44,832 --> 01:22:47,034
Or all your bullshit
about family and loyalty?

885

886
01:22:50,071 --> 01:22:53,040
You wanna know why
I am like I am?

887
01:22:53,074 --> 01:22:54,809
Because I have to be.

888
01:22:56,010 --> 01:22:58,411
That's what makes America work.

889
01:22:58,445 --> 01:23:00,413
You lied and cheat
your own people.

890
01:23:03,450 --> 01:23:05,685
I didn't force you to do shit.

891
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:09,389
You cheated those
migrants just like me.

892
01:23:10,124 --> 01:23:11,691
I'll never be like you.

893
01:23:12,592 --> 01:23:15,395
We're the same, and the why?

894
01:23:15,428 --> 01:23:16,063
Guilt.

895
01:23:17,764 --> 01:23:20,034
It eats your heart
out from the inside.

896
01:23:22,003 --> 01:23:24,071
It takes a lot to
give up a child

897
01:23:26,073 --> 01:23:27,574
for your own survival.

898
01:23:30,845 --> 01:23:33,647
Like I said before,
the past is the past.

899
01:23:35,749 --> 01:23:38,085
We make our own fate here.

900
01:23:42,089 --> 01:23:44,524
Shooting me does you nothing.

901
01:23:46,626 --> 01:23:48,562
When I'm dead, the money's gone.

902
01:23:52,499 --> 01:23:54,035
Or you could have it all.

903
01:23:56,871 --> 01:23:58,940
I'll get your daughter back.

904
01:24:12,086 --> 01:24:14,721
What about the FBI,
the delivery truck?

905
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:18,692
Rambo killed the gweilo driver

906
01:24:18,725 --> 01:24:20,995
and the Flushing crew is gone.

907
01:24:21,028 --> 01:24:23,663
The only thing tying us
to frozen bodies is you.

908
01:24:27,068 --> 01:24:28,002
What about Rambo?

909
01:24:29,036 --> 01:24:31,738
Rambo's my son. He'll obey.

910
01:24:31,771 --> 01:24:33,440
But you have to
make up with him.

911
01:24:33,473 --> 01:24:35,442
He's still sour about Pai Gwut.

912
01:24:41,082 --> 01:24:44,051
You come to the
wedding, bring lobsters.

913
01:24:44,085 --> 01:24:46,386
My good son's finally
getting married.

914
01:24:58,032 --> 01:25:00,968
[foreboding music]

915
01:25:19,854 --> 01:25:22,756
[Tse] What about the
FBI, the delivery truck?

916
01:25:24,825 --> 01:25:26,459
[Dai Mah] Rambo
killed the gweilo driver

917
01:25:26,493 --> 01:25:28,195
and the Flushing crew is gone.

918
01:25:29,230 --> 01:25:31,698
The only thing tying us to
the frozen bodies is you.

919
01:25:48,515 --> 01:25:49,683
Leave Rosie alone.

920
01:25:52,585 --> 01:25:54,989
And why would I wanna
hurt a little girl, huh?

921
01:25:56,157 --> 01:25:57,490
Killing Zareeb?

922
01:25:58,826 --> 01:26:00,828
Yeah, that was
payback for Pai Gwut.

923
01:26:03,931 --> 01:26:04,731
I get it.

924
01:26:08,635 --> 01:26:10,470
And you don't
answer to Ma anymore.

925
01:26:12,106 --> 01:26:13,606
You're my pet now.

926
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:16,210
[tense music]

927
01:26:16,243 --> 01:26:19,479
[thunder rumbles]

928
01:26:23,217 --> 01:26:24,784
[Derek] Mom, come on up here!

929
01:26:26,187 --> 01:26:28,722
I just wanted everyone
to raise a glass

930
01:26:28,755 --> 01:26:31,658
to the woman who made me
the man that I am today.

931
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:35,096
A woman who raised me
when we had nothing.

932
01:26:39,166 --> 01:26:40,968
[Rambo] But killing Zareeb?

933
01:26:41,002 --> 01:26:42,970
That was payback for Pai Gwut.

934
01:26:55,016 --> 01:26:56,017
Here's to you, Mom.

935
01:26:58,085 --> 01:27:00,754
[guests murmur]

936
01:27:17,204 --> 01:27:19,073
Where's Rambo?

937
01:27:19,106 --> 01:27:20,141
[Rambo] The fuck is this?

938
01:27:20,174 --> 01:27:21,541
I didn't do shit!

939
01:27:22,143 --> 01:27:24,278
[gun fires]

940
01:27:31,952 --> 01:27:34,687
[dramatic music]

941
01:28:43,224 --> 01:28:45,658
[Tse] I didn't come
for the American dream.

942
01:28:46,793 --> 01:28:47,694
I came for family.

943
01:29:04,278 --> 01:29:06,280
I left her once for my survival.

944
01:29:07,815 --> 01:29:11,085
This time, I leave her for hers.

945
01:30:01,335 --> 01:30:04,205
[upbeat disco music]

946
01:30:21,255 --> 01:30:25,092
[singing in foreign language]

947
