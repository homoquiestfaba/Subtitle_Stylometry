1
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,771
In the early '30s,

2
00:01:04,845 --> 00:01:08,941
Adolf Hitler and his inner circle
became obsessed with the occult,

3
00:01:09,015 --> 00:01:13,179
believing that the black arts were key
to their plan for world domination.

4
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:14,845
Nazi agents travelled the globe

5
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:18,584
in search of ancient Nordic relics
known as rune stones.

6
00:01:18,658 --> 00:01:21,650
They believed if they harnessed
the power of these stones,

7
00:01:21,728 --> 00:01:24,094
nothing could stop the march
of the Master Race.

8
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:28,857
The symbols inscribed in these stones
were said to describe the path...

9
00:01:31,905 --> 00:01:33,998
...to immortality.

10
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:37,296
''Dear Mr. Wollner,

11
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,431
I write you on behalf
of a society of scholars

12
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:45,842
researching Germany's heritage
throughout North America.

13
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:51,176
We chose your family
with care, Mr. Wollner.

14
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,351
We ask you to consider
hosting Herr Richard Wirth

15
00:02:58,425 --> 00:03:00,950
as he conducts work in your region.

16
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:03,495
He requires only a private room

17
00:03:03,563 --> 00:03:06,657
and modest accommodations
within your home.

18
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:10,965
A gratuity will be provided
each month for your pains.

19
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:14,473
Find enclosed an advance
of this amount.

20
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,135
$150.

21
00:03:18,645 --> 00:03:21,113
I think we should discuss.

22
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:26,579
$150, Mama.

23
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:15,094
Liese!

24
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:44,328
Who's there?

25
00:05:07,854 --> 00:05:10,982
Liese, we will clear the table now.

26
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:28,398
Annaliese.

27
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:30,102
Yes.

28
00:05:30,176 --> 00:05:31,700
She goes to school where she must.

29
00:05:31,778 --> 00:05:33,541
All of us practice.

30
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:35,581
And for in town when we go to sell.

31
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:39,051
Naturally.

32
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:40,882
Forgive me.

33
00:05:40,954 --> 00:05:42,581
I'm old-fashioned now.

34
00:05:42,656 --> 00:05:44,851
At any rate, l needn't bother.

35
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:47,415
The whole world will speak German
in a matter of years.

36
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:51,157
We were told you were a historian.

37
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,789
Yes.

38
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:56,059
Did you know...

39
00:05:56,136 --> 00:05:57,831
our Viking ancestors

40
00:05:57,904 --> 00:05:59,337
discovered this land?

41
00:06:00,774 --> 00:06:02,571
Columbus was, of course, a fraud.

42
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:06,776
Finlandic parties
scouted up these rivers

43
00:06:06,846 --> 00:06:09,007
300 years before the Spanish arrived.

44
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:10,709
They were repelled by Indians,

45
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:12,752
but they left their rune stones behind.

46
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:18,088
Like the ancient stone you dug up
when you built this farm.

47
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:21,259
How did you know that?

48
00:06:24,397 --> 00:06:26,194
What became of the stone?

49
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:28,860
We used it in the foundation
when we built the barn.

50
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:30,300
It's in the root cellar.

51
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,668
We faced it inward. You can still see it.

52
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:36,233
How forward-thinking of you.

53
00:06:37,744 --> 00:06:40,338
We should have asked more questions.

54
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:42,313
We can ask in the morning.

55
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:45,917
I mean, weeks ago.

56
00:07:45,578 --> 00:07:47,512
Show me the stone.

57
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:11,767
They were here.

58
00:08:13,072 --> 00:08:14,835
The Nordic gods.

59
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:17,001
Our ancestors.

60
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:20,269
Don't cry.

61
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:21,643
Bring her here to me.

62
00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:25,077
They tell me you're in school.

63
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:27,415
You like to study, then.

64
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:28,977
Find things.

65
00:08:29,055 --> 00:08:30,079
Challenge your mind.

66
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:32,283
Study this.

67
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,386
Look at your birdie now.

68
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:15,334
See? She's winking at you.

69
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:19,297
And with practice,

70
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:22,170
I will be able to make
her live even longer.

71
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:27,444
That's all I can do for now.

72
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:31,676
But I have my books.

73
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:33,742
I have time.

74
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,811
I have this stone.

75
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,764
Those who came before rule the blood.

76
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:52,996
And when you rule the blood,
death is no longer the end.

77
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:56,632
You love your family, yes?

78
00:09:58,478 --> 00:10:00,969
You'd do anything for them.

79
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:03,880
Don't want them to end up
like your little birdie, do you?

80
00:10:09,455 --> 00:10:11,514
You'll be a good little helper.

81
00:10:15,228 --> 00:10:19,358
Your part will hurt
only a little bit each time.

82
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:32,841
Airways are clear.
Get that oxygen over here.

83
00:10:32,912 --> 00:10:35,380
- Can you hear me?
- Get them to all stand back!

84
00:10:35,448 --> 00:10:36,346
Sir, can you hear me?

85
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,883
Look at me, sir.

86
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,441
- Put the gun down.
- How about not do that, ma'am?

87
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,350
Sir, can you hear me?

88
00:10:41,421 --> 00:10:42,615
Can you hear me, sir?

89
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:44,680
Don't go to sleep.
Watch me now, sir.

90
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:46,790
- Calm down.
- Don't do that, ma'am.

91
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:47,917
Put your gun on the ground.

92
00:10:47,994 --> 00:10:49,757
Put your gun on the ground, ma'am.

93
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:50,818
Coronary!

94
00:10:50,897 --> 00:10:52,694
Here, look at me, ma'am.

95
00:10:52,765 --> 00:10:54,494
Put your gun on the ground.

96
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:56,501
- Larry, open that compress.
- Stand back.

97
00:10:57,603 --> 00:10:58,797
Larry! Come on, get it open!

98
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:01,467
Larry, put pressure on that.

99
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:05,169
Put your gun on the ground!

100
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:07,337
Sir, look at me.

101
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:08,641
We're losing him.

102
00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:10,940
Look here, ma'am.

103
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:12,416
Nobody will hurt you. Look at me.

104
00:11:12,485 --> 00:11:13,417
Larry, we lost him.

105
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:14,817
Just put the gun down.

106
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:16,377
Put it down.

107
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,050
Look at me, ma'am.

108
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:22,321
They're cooking meth
in here! Get down!

109
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,989
Is everyone okay?

110
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:16,713
Is that tank turned off?

111
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:19,741
I know who you are.

112
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:22,184
Somebody out in the yard?

113
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:24,280
I heard somebody.

114
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:25,984
You bring the boys over?

115
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:28,027
The boys are at home with Barb.

116
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:29,026
What are you doing?

117
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:30,460
Just trying to help, Dad.

118
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,054
If you want to help, rake the yard.

119
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:33,120
It looks like shit.

120
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:35,565
Just finished a 15-hour shift, Dad.

121
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:37,330
Don't worry.

122
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:39,428
Your brother will do it. Is he with you?

123
00:12:39,505 --> 00:12:42,167
Dad? He's been gone two years.

124
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:44,106
He's back from Iraq. I saw him.

125
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:48,179
It ain't easy.

126
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:49,771
I know, Dad.

127
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,048
What do you know?
You weren't there.

128
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,247
Your brother had to go
and kill the sons of bitches.

129
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:58,381
You weren't in Iraq, were you?

130
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,948
He comes home a hero.

131
00:13:00,026 --> 00:13:02,051
You take him fishing
up near Town Creek,

132
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:04,028
his family never sees him again.

133
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:06,156
Why didn't you save your brother?

134
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:11,930
- I'll make your dinner.
- Why didn't you tell me

135
00:13:12,004 --> 00:13:13,869
you put up a stone for him
at the cemetery?

136
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,307
- I did tell you, Dad.
- I had to read it in the goddamn paper.

137
00:13:18,878 --> 00:13:20,243
I should have been there for that.

138
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:23,879
We all should have
been there for that.

139
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,076
What the hell do you think

140
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:26,709
I’m hanging around here for, you?

141
00:13:26,786 --> 00:13:28,344
You don't tell your father shit.

142
00:13:30,423 --> 00:13:31,947
I took you to the ceremony myself.

143
00:14:05,057 --> 00:14:06,183
- Yeah.
- I want to go trick-or-treating.

144
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:09,023
Uncle Evan, you forgot.
You were gonna take us trick-or-treating.

145
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:10,722
It’s almost dark out.

146
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:13,321
- You promised.
- I love Daddy.

147
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,593
Hey.

148
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:16,635
So you think I forgot?

149
00:14:16,702 --> 00:14:18,397
Well, I’m on my way.

150
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:32,580
Trick or treat!

151
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:34,176
Thank you!

152
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:10,050
Guys, come on.

153
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,119
Didn't plan on it, Barb.
We just ended up there.

154
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:15,319
You know how I feel about it.

155
00:15:15,394 --> 00:15:17,624
I just thought the boys
needed a place to go.

156
00:15:17,697 --> 00:15:19,528
But he's not there. He's missing.

157
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:22,227
Why do you keep trying to bury him?
I don't understand.

158
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:24,826
It just seemed like it was time
to make some kind of decision.

159
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:26,531
It’s not yours to make.

160
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:31,874
I’m sorry.

161
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:37,305
Don't make these boys give up hope.

162
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:39,715
It’s all they have.

163
00:15:39,785 --> 00:15:41,252
It’s cruel, okay?

164
00:15:42,588 --> 00:15:44,351
We're all just living on hope and faith.

165
00:15:44,423 --> 00:15:47,859
If I could go back there
and switch places with him,

166
00:15:47,927 --> 00:15:49,326
I would in a minute.

167
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:51,758
I need you to know that.

168
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:53,992
I know.

169
00:15:57,536 --> 00:15:58,434
Good night.

170
00:16:04,777 --> 00:16:06,108
...and Jefferson County

171
00:16:06,178 --> 00:16:08,669
with temperatures
in the low to mid-50s.

172
00:16:08,748 --> 00:16:10,773
The wet weather should
ease off by Saturday morning,

173
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,477
despite cloudy conditions.

174
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:14,917
West Virginians may be in store
for a treat tomorrow night--

175
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:17,854
the first lunar eclipse of the year.

176
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:19,652
So step outside tomorrow night

177
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:21,920
and head down
to the county observatory

178
00:16:21,994 --> 00:16:23,723
which will be holding a public star party

179
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:25,127
on the grounds
of Greenwood Elementary--

180
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:44,913
Evan, wake up.

181
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:46,315
Evan.

182
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:47,443
Evan, wake up.

183
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,646
Evan.

184
00:16:48,721 --> 00:16:49,881
Evan, wake up.

185
00:16:49,955 --> 00:16:51,718
Evan, wake up!

186
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,960
Evan!

187
00:16:56,028 --> 00:16:57,791
Help me!

188
00:16:57,863 --> 00:16:59,091
Vic, where are you?

189
00:16:59,165 --> 00:17:00,359
Evan!

190
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:02,526
He comes home a hero.

191
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:04,330
You take him fishing up near Town Creek,

192
00:17:04,403 --> 00:17:06,530
his family never sees him again.

193
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:08,368
Why didn't you save your brother?

194
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:10,306
Evan, help me!

195
00:17:10,376 --> 00:17:11,468
Vic!

196
00:17:11,544 --> 00:17:13,876
Victor, I can't find you!

197
00:17:13,946 --> 00:17:16,073
Help me, Evan!

198
00:17:17,383 --> 00:17:18,611
Evan!

199
00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:25,017
Evan, wake up.

200
00:17:25,091 --> 00:17:26,058
Wake up.

201
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,251
Evan, wake up.

202
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:29,323
It’s me. Wake up.

203
00:17:29,395 --> 00:17:30,726
Evan, wake up.

204
00:17:31,997 --> 00:17:33,362
It’s me, Victor.

205
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:37,698
It’s me. It’s me.

206
00:17:41,474 --> 00:17:42,463
Who?

207
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:49,809
I need your help tonight.

208
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:51,179
I need your help. No questions.

209
00:17:53,285 --> 00:17:54,411
Load the boat on the truck

210
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:55,920
and bring enough gear
for two days out.

211
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:57,353
Bring the guns
and plenty of ammo.

212
00:17:57,423 --> 00:17:58,913
- Why?
- Don't tell Dad.

213
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:01,357
No one's to know I’m back
till this is done.

214
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:03,054
- Barbara and the boys--
- I--

215
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:04,721
I said no one.

216
00:18:04,797 --> 00:18:05,786
Now hurry.

217
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:08,163
Wait. No. Let me check you out.

218
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:09,166
- Go.
- Are you hurt?

219
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:10,361
Go.

220
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:11,903
They know I've gone by now.

221
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:13,404
Who? Vic, who knows you're gone?

222
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:15,201
Go.

223
00:18:18,144 --> 00:18:19,634
Just hurry.

224
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:27,571
Evan, what's up, buddy?

225
00:19:27,646 --> 00:19:30,444
I need you to come over right now
and look after my dad while I’m gone.

226
00:19:30,516 --> 00:19:31,642
Sure.

227
00:19:31,717 --> 00:19:32,945
For how long?

228
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:44,762
Let's go.

229
00:19:50,803 --> 00:19:52,737
Head to Town Creek.
We'll put in there.

230
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:55,438
Are we going after somebody?

231
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:00,712
To shoot?

232
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:14,952
You want out of this,

233
00:20:15,027 --> 00:20:16,892
you tell me now
before it's too late.

234
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,530
You do this with me,
nothing will ever be the same.

235
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:23,466
You'll never be the same.
You ought to know that.

236
00:20:23,536 --> 00:20:26,630
It wouldn't be right
if I didn't tell you that.

237
00:20:26,705 --> 00:20:27,933
It’s your call.

238
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:36,403
Let's go.

239
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,978
I haven't been here

240
00:21:49,054 --> 00:21:51,352
since I came back
with the sheriff in Paw Paw.

241
00:21:51,423 --> 00:21:52,856
This where you ended up?

242
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:55,416
That night, you see anything?

243
00:21:55,494 --> 00:21:57,689
I didn't know if you were
ahead of me or behind me.

244
00:21:57,763 --> 00:21:58,821
I did call it out.

245
00:21:58,897 --> 00:22:00,057
Doesn't matter.

246
00:22:00,132 --> 00:22:02,191
No. I want you to know I tried.

247
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:04,326
We got an hour or two
on foot up Creek Valley.

248
00:22:05,704 --> 00:22:08,229
We searched every inch of ground
within 10 miles of here.

249
00:22:08,307 --> 00:22:09,569
Well, you missed me.

250
00:22:37,636 --> 00:22:40,230
Okay. Keep it quiet. There's a dog.

251
00:23:23,716 --> 00:23:27,015
The father is leaving.
He's not going to be back until after dark.

252
00:23:27,086 --> 00:23:28,644
Are you ready to do this?

253
00:23:30,622 --> 00:23:32,385
You didn't say anything
about a family.

254
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,050
You want to worry about a family,

255
00:23:34,126 --> 00:23:35,991
worry about ours.

256
00:23:36,061 --> 00:23:37,756
You got to give me some kind of reason.

257
00:23:44,837 --> 00:23:46,304
I’m the reason.

258
00:24:18,871 --> 00:24:19,838
You okay?

259
00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:21,532
All right, I’m going in.

260
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:23,438
The minute they see me,
all hell's gonna break loose.

261
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:25,306
I want you to cover the back porch.

262
00:24:25,377 --> 00:24:27,402
Okay? You got it?

263
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:29,242
All right. Come on.

264
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:18,411
Where is he?

265
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:55,190
Evan, shoot!

266
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,811
- Vic!
- In here.

267
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:19,948
Watch her.

268
00:27:20,018 --> 00:27:21,645
There's a girl upstairs.

269
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,914
Liese, run!

270
00:27:22,988 --> 00:27:24,455
Run, Liese!

271
00:27:24,523 --> 00:27:26,013
Liese, run!

272
00:28:27,452 --> 00:28:30,319
It’s okay. Don't be scared.

273
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:31,447
Just hide.

274
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:34,253
I’ll go calm him down.

275
00:28:52,244 --> 00:28:53,302
Where is he?

276
00:28:53,378 --> 00:28:54,845
Fuck! Vic, put the gun down!

277
00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:56,505
Where is he?

278
00:28:59,351 --> 00:29:00,477
Out front!

279
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,710
Run, Liese! Run!

280
00:29:09,795 --> 00:29:11,490
Do it!

281
00:29:11,563 --> 00:29:13,531
Get her inside.

282
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:15,088
Where is he?

283
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:23,836
- Karl!
- Don't look.

284
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:25,604
If you're going to kill him, then kill him.

285
00:29:25,677 --> 00:29:27,269
Try to be quiet now.

286
00:29:27,345 --> 00:29:28,403
Go to hell.

287
00:30:53,632 --> 00:30:55,293
Why did you come here?

288
00:30:56,868 --> 00:30:58,665
We're all going to pay for this now.

289
00:31:01,606 --> 00:31:03,801
You saw everything,
and you did nothing.

290
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:05,365
Don't you touch her.

291
00:31:05,443 --> 00:31:06,740
Shut her up!

292
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:11,379
Every time you stood at this sink

293
00:31:11,449 --> 00:31:13,747
and looked out
at that black container,

294
00:31:13,818 --> 00:31:15,911
you knew, and you did nothing!

295
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:18,586
- Nothing!
- I don't understand.

296
00:31:18,657 --> 00:31:20,124
Why would these people
keep you here?

297
00:31:20,192 --> 00:31:22,183
Dinner time, Liese.

298
00:31:24,229 --> 00:31:26,060
He'll wonder why no one comes.

299
00:31:30,402 --> 00:31:31,835
Where is he?

300
00:31:32,904 --> 00:31:35,498
Jesus! Vic! Stop it!

301
00:31:35,574 --> 00:31:37,098
This is my family.

302
00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:39,075
My brother.

303
00:31:39,144 --> 00:31:41,942
You have no idea
what you've started.

304
00:31:43,315 --> 00:31:45,579
Tonight we'll see him weeping, too.

305
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,750
Tie them up.

306
00:31:49,821 --> 00:31:50,845
What's in the container?

307
00:31:50,922 --> 00:31:51,854
Just tie them up!

308
00:31:51,923 --> 00:31:54,721
Stop ordering me around
and tell me what the hell is going on!

309
00:31:54,793 --> 00:31:57,660
These people took
two years of my life.

310
00:31:57,729 --> 00:31:58,718
My life.

311
00:32:03,235 --> 00:32:04,725
You want to get sympathetic, Evan?

312
00:32:04,803 --> 00:32:06,202
Don't shoot someone in the stomach.

313
00:32:06,271 --> 00:32:07,932
It hurts like hell,
and it takes too long to die.

314
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:10,939
Go tie them up.

315
00:33:02,093 --> 00:33:03,560
What is in that black container?

316
00:33:08,733 --> 00:33:10,997
Look, I’m not here to hurt you.

317
00:33:11,069 --> 00:33:12,229
I’ll figure this out.

318
00:33:47,505 --> 00:33:48,904
This is his doing.

319
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:54,711
Time doesn't touch us.

320
00:33:59,984 --> 00:34:01,076
You're lying.

321
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:10,620
I’ve been 17 longer
than you've been alive.

322
00:34:19,437 --> 00:34:20,904
What's in that container?

323
00:34:31,015 --> 00:34:32,448
What you got today, Mr. Wollner?

324
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:33,643
Five crates.

325
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:35,083
Yeah, we can do that.

326
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:38,282
Cash or trade?

327
00:34:38,356 --> 00:34:39,345
Trade.

328
00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:46,587
I don't know how you keep it running,
but she sure is pretty.

329
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:52,325
What's she, about 1929?

330
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:56,131
1930, maybe?

331
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:41,085
Evan! Evan!

332
00:35:41,152 --> 00:35:43,177
You got no reason to look in there.

333
00:35:45,423 --> 00:35:46,981
I thought you were the reason.

334
00:35:48,393 --> 00:35:49,985
Don't.

335
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:30,793
It’s okay. I’m not with them.

336
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:32,336
I’m getting you out of here.
It’s okay.

337
00:36:33,771 --> 00:36:35,671
My name is Evan Marsh.
I’m a paramedic.

338
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,798
Look, man, they...

339
00:36:38,843 --> 00:36:41,311
they jumped me in the woods
about a week ago.

340
00:36:41,379 --> 00:36:43,745
I think I saw your wife and kids
look for you in the woods.

341
00:36:43,815 --> 00:36:45,806
It’s okay. I got you now.

342
00:36:45,884 --> 00:36:46,908
Just do it.

343
00:36:46,985 --> 00:36:48,612
Look, I can't do it with my hands.

344
00:36:48,686 --> 00:36:50,586
- Be right back.
- No!

345
00:36:50,655 --> 00:36:51,713
Hurry.

346
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:55,350
Hurry.

347
00:37:12,677 --> 00:37:13,837
Take him down the river to Paw Paw.

348
00:37:13,912 --> 00:37:14,936
Call an ambulance from there.

349
00:37:15,013 --> 00:37:16,480
We can take him with us
when we're done.

350
00:37:16,548 --> 00:37:18,709
- We're going now.
- We ain't finished yet!

351
00:37:18,783 --> 00:37:20,216
We ain't gonna leave him
strung up in there.

352
00:37:20,285 --> 00:37:21,946
We could do this.
Set up an ambush--

353
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,317
You inside, me in the yard.

354
00:37:23,388 --> 00:37:24,548
He doesn't need to be
involved in that.

355
00:37:24,622 --> 00:37:25,953
That man's got family somewhere.

356
00:37:26,024 --> 00:37:27,821
All those times you asked me
what I did in the war--

357
00:37:27,892 --> 00:37:28,916
what it was like--

358
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:30,722
Don't throw that goddamn war at me.

359
00:37:30,795 --> 00:37:32,888
I said I was gonna enlist.
You signed up behind my back.

360
00:37:32,964 --> 00:37:34,864
And I had to stay here
and take care of Dad every day

361
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:36,560
and have him tell me
how you're his fucking hero.

362
00:37:36,634 --> 00:37:38,932
I signed up because I thought
I could make it back alive!

363
00:37:39,938 --> 00:37:40,905
And I couldn't?

364
00:37:40,972 --> 00:37:43,270
You here are killing
old women and girls.

365
00:37:43,341 --> 00:37:45,536
Oh, yeah, big fucking war hero.

366
00:37:47,178 --> 00:37:49,146
You ever stop to think
how this could have been you?

367
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:52,877
That's all I ever think about!

368
00:37:52,951 --> 00:37:54,612
That's why I’m here!

369
00:37:54,686 --> 00:37:56,449
Now we're gonna cut
that poor bastard loose,

370
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:57,920
take him in the house
out of the way,

371
00:37:57,989 --> 00:37:59,456
and take care of this!

372
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:02,483
Then take you back to your boys.

373
00:38:06,197 --> 00:38:07,721
Don't forget about your boys, Vic.

374
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:42,819
Someone's coming!

375
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:55,302
Hurry. We got to hurry.

376
00:39:55,373 --> 00:39:57,432
- He's coming.
- Just try to hold steady.

377
00:40:22,934 --> 00:40:23,992
Put him inside.

378
00:41:18,723 --> 00:41:19,712
Get up!

379
00:41:21,325 --> 00:41:22,417
Where the hell is he?

380
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:25,692
Where is he?

381
00:41:25,763 --> 00:41:27,321
Where is he?

382
00:41:27,398 --> 00:41:29,923
What have you done to my son?

383
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:31,400
Where's the rest of my family?

384
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:33,266
Where the hell is he?

385
00:41:35,206 --> 00:41:36,400
You don't know what you've done.

386
00:41:36,474 --> 00:41:37,668
You must go!

387
00:41:37,742 --> 00:41:39,801
Go now, while there's still time!

388
00:42:01,632 --> 00:42:03,429
Your bullets won't hurt him!

389
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:04,627
Run!

390
00:42:06,904 --> 00:42:09,498
He can't come into the house!
He's barred!

391
00:42:11,542 --> 00:42:12,668
He's out!

392
00:42:55,987 --> 00:42:57,249
Where the hell is it?

393
00:42:57,321 --> 00:42:59,516
He can't come in!

394
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:04,059
I’m going to keep him tied--

395
00:43:43,034 --> 00:43:44,365
He can't come into the house.

396
00:43:44,435 --> 00:43:45,595
He's barred.

397
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:46,830
What do you mean, barred?

398
00:43:46,904 --> 00:43:48,394
He can't come in.

399
00:43:48,472 --> 00:43:50,497
The painting on the doors
and the windows keep him out.

400
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,773
What is that out there?

401
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:27,607
Wirth-- Richard Wirth.

402
00:45:26,504 --> 00:45:28,995
The door! Get the door!

403
00:45:36,514 --> 00:45:38,072
What the hell are you doing?

404
00:45:38,149 --> 00:45:40,549
The window.

405
00:45:40,618 --> 00:45:43,212
He can come in through the window.

406
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:44,345
Come on.

407
00:45:46,323 --> 00:45:49,486
This rune is the only reason
he has not killed us all!

408
00:46:03,774 --> 00:46:04,832
Come on!

409
00:46:08,879 --> 00:46:10,107
- You got it?
- Yeah.

410
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:13,948
Fuck!

411
00:46:19,223 --> 00:46:21,054
He can be controlled.

412
00:46:22,793 --> 00:46:24,886
Somewhat.

413
00:46:24,962 --> 00:46:27,624
We know some things.

414
00:46:27,698 --> 00:46:29,563
Maybe enough.

415
00:46:55,626 --> 00:46:56,888
The Nazis sent him.

416
00:46:58,229 --> 00:47:00,459
It was 1936.

417
00:47:00,531 --> 00:47:04,160
We thought Wirth was a scholar,

418
00:47:04,235 --> 00:47:06,465
but he was here
to practice the occult.

419
00:47:06,537 --> 00:47:08,198
Rune stones.

420
00:47:08,272 --> 00:47:10,536
Blood rituals.

421
00:47:10,608 --> 00:47:12,667
We didn't know.

422
00:47:12,743 --> 00:47:16,179
And then the war started,
and they couldn't retrieve him.

423
00:47:16,247 --> 00:47:17,874
So we imprisoned him.

424
00:47:17,948 --> 00:47:19,176
Liese did.

425
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:21,184
She put runes around the yard.

426
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:22,719
The symbols on the fences

427
00:47:22,786 --> 00:47:24,811
keep him on the farm
and out of the house.

428
00:47:24,889 --> 00:47:26,379
She was only 12 at the time.

429
00:47:26,457 --> 00:47:28,755
Five years passed.

430
00:47:28,826 --> 00:47:32,193
But by then,
we were his prisoners.

431
00:47:32,263 --> 00:47:34,754
Just tell me how to kill him.

432
00:47:34,832 --> 00:47:36,732
Take your brother and leave now.

433
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,394
If you can make it outside
the fences, you can get out.

434
00:47:40,704 --> 00:47:42,035
We'll take you with us.

435
00:47:42,106 --> 00:47:45,303
No. We have to stay.

436
00:47:45,376 --> 00:47:47,708
We let him into our lives.

437
00:47:47,778 --> 00:47:49,245
We can't leave here.

438
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:39,351
Evan!

439
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:57,002
No.

440
00:51:56,627 --> 00:51:57,992
Where's my father? Where's Karl?

441
00:51:58,061 --> 00:51:59,653
They're dead.

442
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:01,095
They're lucky.

443
00:52:01,165 --> 00:52:02,359
They're free now.

444
00:52:04,568 --> 00:52:05,796
She's having trouble breathing.

445
00:52:05,869 --> 00:52:07,131
Does she take any medicine
for her heart?

446
00:52:07,204 --> 00:52:09,229
- Do you have any aspirin?
- No.

447
00:52:15,179 --> 00:52:16,806
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I gotta get my bag.

448
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,348
- That woman needs help now.
- These people can't be trusted.

449
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:46,205
Run!

450
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:08,127
Here, chew these. It'll help.

451
00:53:21,912 --> 00:53:23,436
He's killed the generator.

452
00:53:23,514 --> 00:53:24,538
Guns.

453
00:53:28,085 --> 00:53:29,677
- How do I kill him?
- Victor, enough.

454
00:53:29,753 --> 00:53:31,345
- I'm trying to save our lives.
- So am I.

455
00:53:31,421 --> 00:53:33,048
Either way, we all die.

456
00:53:34,758 --> 00:53:36,350
You're not the only one who's suffered.

457
00:53:45,702 --> 00:53:47,795
He started with me.

458
00:54:07,658 --> 00:54:09,592
I was 12 when he came to our farm.

459
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,389
That's when he first fed on me.

460
00:54:11,461 --> 00:54:13,793
When my brother saw
what he'd done to me,

461
00:54:13,864 --> 00:54:16,924
he tried to kill Wirth,
but it was too late.

462
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,026
He was already too strong.

463
00:54:20,103 --> 00:54:23,072
All he could do was take my place.

464
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:26,109
He gave his own blood for a while.

465
00:54:26,176 --> 00:54:28,269
Wirth, he almost killed us,

466
00:54:28,345 --> 00:54:29,812
but he needed our help,

467
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,609
so he froze us in time like this.

468
00:54:31,682 --> 00:54:34,207
I think it was the fifth year.

469
00:54:34,284 --> 00:54:37,310
A vagrant who came here
looking for work.

470
00:54:37,387 --> 00:54:39,252
We'd put him up in the trailer.

471
00:54:39,323 --> 00:54:40,756
First victim?

472
00:54:40,824 --> 00:54:42,655
We were also victims.

473
00:54:46,463 --> 00:54:48,795
Over the years, I've stolen
many of his books and journals.

474
00:54:48,865 --> 00:54:51,527
Everything I’ve learned,
I’ve learned from these.

475
00:54:54,871 --> 00:54:58,170
At first, my father thought
it was a harmless superstition.

476
00:54:58,241 --> 00:55:00,368
But I’ve seen what he can do.

477
00:55:00,444 --> 00:55:02,844
At first, he raised small things.

478
00:55:02,913 --> 00:55:05,711
My bird, the pigs, dogs.

479
00:55:05,782 --> 00:55:07,181
He'd kill them
and bring them back.

480
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:09,047
But he needed blood for the ritual.

481
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,053
Human blood.

482
00:55:11,121 --> 00:55:13,555
Blood of the living.

483
00:55:13,624 --> 00:55:17,526
What happened to the poor fucks
you strung up in the trailer?

484
00:55:17,594 --> 00:55:19,221
What happened to them?

485
00:55:19,296 --> 00:55:22,561
A few have died, yes.

486
00:55:22,633 --> 00:55:24,328
But to save how many?

487
00:55:24,401 --> 00:55:25,834
You've seen what he can do.

488
00:55:25,902 --> 00:55:27,836
Can you imagine if he got out?

489
00:55:27,904 --> 00:55:30,202
We had him contained
until you came here.

490
00:55:31,942 --> 00:55:35,708
The next time he kills,
it'll be on your conscience, not mine.

491
00:55:35,779 --> 00:55:37,906
He's barred from the house. We'll just
hole up here and starve him out.

492
00:55:37,981 --> 00:55:40,415
We'll starve well before he will.

493
00:55:46,289 --> 00:55:48,917
He's going back to his pit. Let's go.

494
00:55:48,992 --> 00:55:50,823
Wait. He's going back to the stone.

495
00:55:50,894 --> 00:55:52,088
It gives him more strength.

496
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:42,410
You said you contained him. How?

497
00:56:42,479 --> 00:56:45,209
The runes. Like the windows.

498
00:56:45,282 --> 00:56:47,341
We painted barring runes
on the perimeter fence.

499
00:56:47,417 --> 00:56:49,351
Okay, now, what are the runes?

500
00:56:49,419 --> 00:56:51,046
Ancient Nordic alphabet.

501
00:56:51,121 --> 00:56:53,521
He believes he's descended
from the Vikings.

502
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:57,993
We gave him blood,
but just not enough to finish the ritual.

503
00:56:58,061 --> 00:57:01,497
Once it ends, no one
will be able to contain him.

504
00:57:01,565 --> 00:57:03,931
- How does it end?
- All I have to go on

505
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,264
are a few drawings in this book.

506
00:57:06,336 --> 00:57:08,634
But I do know this
is his ultimate goal.

507
00:57:08,705 --> 00:57:10,400
This. This drawing right here.

508
00:57:10,474 --> 00:57:13,170
- This is what he's after.
- What the hell is it?

509
00:57:13,243 --> 00:57:15,040
A third eye.

510
00:57:15,112 --> 00:57:17,410
The members of Hitler's
society who sent him here

511
00:57:17,481 --> 00:57:20,382
thought you could
develop one over time.

512
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:22,145
It's released during a lunar eclipse,

513
00:57:22,219 --> 00:57:23,982
making you all powerful.

514
00:57:24,054 --> 00:57:26,852
I don't know what it will be exactly,

515
00:57:26,923 --> 00:57:30,450
but I do know he needs blood,
a lot of it.

516
00:57:30,527 --> 00:57:32,757
Just not his own.
That would be poison to him.

517
00:57:32,829 --> 00:57:36,060
Once his third eye is released,
he'll cross over.

518
00:57:36,133 --> 00:57:37,725
Nothing will be able to contain him,

519
00:57:37,801 --> 00:57:39,666
not even the runes.

520
00:57:39,736 --> 00:57:41,328
How do you stop him
from crossing over?

521
00:57:41,404 --> 00:57:42,803
There has to be a way.

522
00:57:42,873 --> 00:57:44,431
The bones.

523
00:57:50,747 --> 00:57:52,578
The bones.

524
00:57:56,853 --> 00:57:58,320
Maybe.

525
00:58:02,726 --> 00:58:05,354
But someone
will have to go outside.

526
00:58:20,377 --> 00:58:22,572
He brought his ancestors'
bones from Germany

527
00:58:22,646 --> 00:58:24,511
and made them into a kind of armor.

528
00:58:24,581 --> 00:58:26,378
He wore it at rituals until I stole it.

529
00:58:26,449 --> 00:58:28,474
Yeah, I’ve seen it.
It’s in the back of the barn.

530
00:58:28,552 --> 00:58:30,782
In those bones
is the blood of his family.

531
00:58:30,854 --> 00:58:32,446
He can't trace or hunt against them.

532
00:58:32,522 --> 00:58:34,149
And after I put it on?

533
00:58:34,224 --> 00:58:36,658
You need to break the link
between his blood and his mind.

534
00:58:36,726 --> 00:58:38,887
If you can keep him
from getting any more blood,

535
00:58:38,962 --> 00:58:40,862
maybe you can stop him
from crossing over.

536
00:58:40,931 --> 00:58:42,592
Just get him in the front yard.

537
00:59:16,933 --> 00:59:18,457
Hey, Wirth, your books!

538
00:59:28,278 --> 00:59:30,940
Come on, you fuck!

539
01:00:08,885 --> 01:00:10,648
Run!

540
01:00:37,814 --> 01:00:39,679
- Shoot him!
- Bullets don't work.

541
01:00:39,749 --> 01:00:42,775
Not Wirth.
He can't feed off the dead.

542
01:00:47,324 --> 01:00:48,791
Do it, or I'll do it!

543
01:01:06,343 --> 01:01:08,038
Now you're like us.

544
01:02:06,803 --> 01:02:08,270
It’s begun.

545
01:02:57,487 --> 01:02:58,818
Luke?

546
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:15,961
I need you to help me.

547
01:03:21,811 --> 01:03:23,802
Can you do that?

548
01:03:25,482 --> 01:03:28,212
I need you to put me somewhere...

549
01:03:29,219 --> 01:03:31,312
where I can't hurt you.

550
01:03:37,427 --> 01:03:39,418
Just do it.

551
01:03:48,905 --> 01:03:51,135
My family, my children.

552
01:03:51,207 --> 01:03:54,472
My family, they're gonna come
and get me, bring me home, right?

553
01:03:54,544 --> 01:03:56,136
They will, won't they?

554
01:04:04,554 --> 01:04:07,455
Evan, open the door!

555
01:04:16,599 --> 01:04:18,362
That's mine.

556
01:04:18,434 --> 01:04:20,231
I'm gonna kill you.

557
01:04:20,303 --> 01:04:21,895
No.

558
01:04:21,971 --> 01:04:24,098
You're going to feed me.

559
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:30,743
I've known men like you all my life.

560
01:04:30,813 --> 01:04:33,680
Tiny men with your tiny ambitions.

561
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:37,550
Kill the enemy.

562
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:40,020
You all end up the same--

563
01:04:40,089 --> 01:04:43,957
making death with your own hands
and calling others monsters.

564
01:07:51,347 --> 01:07:54,874
Evan, get the bones!

565
01:08:38,027 --> 01:08:40,086
You said Wirth can't drink
his own blood, right?

566
01:08:40,163 --> 01:08:41,425
Yes.

567
01:08:41,497 --> 01:08:43,965
Give me your scarf.
Tell me how you fed him every night.

568
01:08:44,033 --> 01:08:47,901
After dark, we'd prepare
who was in the trailer,

569
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:49,699
make the incision,

570
01:08:49,772 --> 01:08:51,364
then I'd ring the bell.

571
01:08:51,441 --> 01:08:53,671
My father would put on the bone tunic,

572
01:08:53,743 --> 01:08:55,540
open the cellar, and let him out.

573
01:08:55,611 --> 01:08:58,478
Who made the incisions?

574
01:08:58,548 --> 01:09:01,574
They had to be done
a certain way with a certain knife.

575
01:09:01,651 --> 01:09:03,983
You did it.

576
01:09:08,124 --> 01:09:10,718
You're gonna have to do
the same thing to me tonight.

577
01:09:13,396 --> 01:09:15,364
Please, no. I can't.

578
01:09:15,431 --> 01:09:17,524
Yes, you can.

579
01:09:20,503 --> 01:09:22,027
We do this.

580
01:09:22,104 --> 01:09:24,629
We poison him with the blood
of his own family.

581
01:09:29,245 --> 01:09:30,542
Come on. Let's go.

582
01:09:32,181 --> 01:09:34,172
Don't go.

583
01:09:36,786 --> 01:09:38,720
Love you.

584
01:10:19,562 --> 01:10:23,089
You ever wonder
how you managed to escape?

585
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:30,103
The only one after all these years.

586
01:10:32,975 --> 01:10:34,909
Very simple.

587
01:10:34,977 --> 01:10:36,877
I let you.

588
01:10:37,914 --> 01:10:39,779
I could feel your hatred.

589
01:10:39,849 --> 01:10:42,340
I knew you'd come back.

590
01:10:46,222 --> 01:10:49,749
Tonight, we'll make this possible.

591
01:10:49,825 --> 01:10:52,760
You released me from the family.

592
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:18,844
Blood is blood, right?
He is his family.

593
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:22,954
Do it.

594
01:11:26,329 --> 01:11:27,421
Finish it.

595
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,831
Now ring the bell.
Go back in the house.

596
01:11:39,909 --> 01:11:41,274
It’s not finished.

597
01:11:47,049 --> 01:11:49,017
It will protect you.

598
01:11:49,085 --> 01:11:52,111
Otherwise he'd bleed you dry in no time.

599
01:11:52,188 --> 01:11:54,383
Go.

600
01:11:55,992 --> 01:11:57,857
Go.

601
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,607
Wirth!

602
01:14:07,623 --> 01:14:10,353
Your reward for helping me--

603
01:14:10,426 --> 01:14:12,326
you get to see your brother die.

604
01:14:12,394 --> 01:14:14,419
I’m waiting for you, Wirth!

605
01:14:23,272 --> 01:14:24,330
Evan.

606
01:14:25,441 --> 01:14:26,840
Evan.

607
01:14:45,127 --> 01:14:48,062
Evan! Evan!

608
01:16:36,872 --> 01:16:38,737
You poisoned me!

609
01:16:48,717 --> 01:16:50,651
This is our time.

610
01:16:51,887 --> 01:16:54,549
Should have happened long ago.

611
01:16:55,958 --> 01:16:58,791
When Mr. Wirth come in now.

612
01:17:39,568 --> 01:17:42,503
Wirth!

613
01:17:53,549 --> 01:17:56,347
Wirth!

614
01:19:11,727 --> 01:19:13,285
Liese!

615
01:19:32,381 --> 01:19:33,541
Liese!

616
01:19:46,228 --> 01:19:48,458
Liese?

617
01:20:27,569 --> 01:20:30,970
Himmler sent eight others like Wirth

618
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:35,066
to other families, other farms

619
01:20:35,144 --> 01:20:38,944
where ancient rune stones
had been found.

620
01:20:50,859 --> 01:20:53,521
I was expecting this.

621
01:20:56,298 --> 01:20:58,528
All those years,

622
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:02,297
all at once, like an avalanche.

623
01:21:03,472 --> 01:21:06,032
Well, what can I do?

624
01:21:06,108 --> 01:21:09,077
Stay with me until it's over.

625
01:21:22,191 --> 01:21:24,284
Don't hate us.

626
01:22:23,418 --> 01:22:26,012
Okay, here are more buns.

627
01:22:26,088 --> 01:22:28,022
Here's the mustard.

628
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:29,352
Mustard?

629
01:22:40,168 --> 01:22:41,635
Hey, baby.

630
01:22:41,703 --> 01:22:43,398
You okay?

631
01:22:43,472 --> 01:22:45,997
Yeah.

632
01:22:46,074 --> 01:22:48,167
I’ll be right there.

633
01:22:55,717 --> 01:22:59,050
Himmler sent eight others like Wirth

634
01:22:59,121 --> 01:23:02,784
to other families, other farms

635
01:23:02,858 --> 01:23:06,294
where ancient rune stones
had been found.

636
01:24:10,826 --> 01:24:11,918
In the early '30s,

637
01:24:11,993 --> 01:24:16,089
Adolf Hitler and his inner circle
became obsessed with the occult,

638
01:24:16,164 --> 01:24:21,124
believing that the black arts were key
to their plan for world domination.

639
01:24:21,203 --> 01:24:23,535
Nazi agents travelled the globe in search

640
01:24:23,605 --> 01:24:27,701
of ancient Nordic relics
known as rune stones.

641
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:31,610
They believed if they harnessed
the power of these stones,

642
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:35,810
nothing could stop the march
of the Master Race.

643
01:24:35,884 --> 01:24:37,818
The symbols inscribed in these stones

644
01:24:37,886 --> 01:24:42,653
were said to describe the path
to immortality.
