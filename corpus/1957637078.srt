1755
01:33:36,978 --> 01:33:39,747
JAY, I'VE BEEN SHOT.

1756
01:33:57,031 --> 01:34:01,235
WHATEVER DOESN'T KILL US
ONLY MAKES US STRONGER.

1757
01:34:04,872 --> 01:34:06,741
TREVOR!

1758
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:10,177
DAD!

1759
01:34:10,945 --> 01:34:12,079
ARE YOU TWO OK?

IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

1763
01:34:18,052 --> 01:34:19,453
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

1764
01:34:19,487 --> 01:34:21,389
MOVE IT OUT,

1765
01:34:21,422 --> 01:34:22,857
YOU OK, PAL?

1766
01:34:22,890 --> 01:34:24,258
YEAH.

1767
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:27,461
IT'S GOING TO BE
ALL RIGHT NOW.

1768
01:34:27,495 --> 01:34:30,398
OH, I LOVE YOU.

1769
01:34:36,437 --> 01:34:37,471
COME ON.

1770
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:40,207
WE'RE GOING HOME.

1771
01:34:40,975 --> 01:34:41,575
HELLO?

1772
01:34:41,609 --> 01:34:43,844

MORE OFTEN.

1773
01:34:43,878 --> 01:34:45,379
HELLO?

1774
01:34:45,413 --> 01:34:47,048
HOLD YOUR FIRE.

1775
01:34:47,081 --> 01:34:49,216
IS IT OVER?
IS HE GONE?

1776
01:34:49,917 --> 01:34:52,319
[COUGHS]

1777
01:35:00,561 --> 01:35:02,063
MARTIN?

1778
01:35:02,096 --> 01:35:04,298
MARTIN MESSERMAN?

1779
01:35:04,565 --> 01:35:06,901
I'M ROBERT SIKES,

AN INCREDIBLE JOB.

DO ME A FAVOR,
WOULD YOU?

1786
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:21,449
THE NEXT TIME YOU LAND
A PLANE ON MY STRIP,

1787
01:35:21,482 --> 01:35:25,052
BONE UP
ON YOUR MORSE CODE.

1788
01:35:25,853 --> 01:35:28,022
[LAUGHS]

1789
01:35:28,055 --> 01:35:30,257
WELL, IT WAS A PLEASURE
MEETING YOU.

1790
01:35:30,291 --> 01:35:32,927
YOU, TOO.

OH, MY GOD,

1795
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:45,940
GO, DAD.

1796
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:50,211
SORRY.

1797

THIS IS MY GOOD FRIEND
JESSICA.

MY VERY GOOD FRIEND.

1800
01:36:00,855 --> 01:36:04,258
YOU REALLY LANDED THE PLANE
BY YOURSELF?

1801
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:06,427
WERE YOU SCARED?

1802
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:10,464
HEY, IS YOUR DAD
SCARED OF ANYTHING? HUH?

1803
