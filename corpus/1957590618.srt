00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:16,711
Oh, I slept kind of well.

20
00:02:22,948 --> 00:02:23,781
I'm gonna go pick up Stacey.

00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:24,717
Do you wanna come?

22
00:02:24,717 --> 00:02:26,768
- Stacey? Why?

23
00:02:27,619 --> 00:02:28,452
- School finished today.

24
00:02:28,452 --> 00:02:29,769
She's coming with.

25
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:31,341
- I thought her parents
wouldn't let her go.

26
00:02:31,341 --> 00:02:33,331
- Well they wouldn't, but

27
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:36,501
they are going on a spiritual
retreat to San Lucia

28
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:39,159
to find their inner selves.

29
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,117
- How's that even gonna work?

30
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:41,550
Do we even have room?

31
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,512
- Calm down, Bray.

32
00:02:43,512 --> 00:02:45,131
I got a bigger tent.

33
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,629
- I thought this was just
gonna be the two of us.

34
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:47,504

35
00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:49,190
last festival before you have to go back.

36
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,247
- What, so you can ditch me for some guy

37
00:02:51,247 --> 00:02:52,326
as soon as we get there?

38
00:02:52,326 --> 00:02:54,006
No fucking way.

00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:55,488

41
00:02:58,827 --> 00:03:00,948
- Oh, so you're just
gonna make me one instead.

42
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,129
- You've never met this guy.

43
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:07,347
For all you know, he's a chick.

44
00:03:07,347 --> 00:03:08,614
- He sent me videos.

inviting my girlfriend.

honestly I just wanna spend

00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:43,783
I've been waiting an hour.

00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:47,903
Where's your car?

84
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:51,653
- We had a slight hiccup.

85
00:04:58,009 --> 00:04:59,668
- Absolutely not.

86
00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:01,135

Stacey.

88
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,526
The only reason you were
able to do the road trip

89
00:05:07,526 --> 00:05:09,088
in the first place was
because they were gone

90
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:10,045
for the whole month.

91
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:10,878
- That's different.

92
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:11,967
We can't just steal their RV.

93
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:13,365
Rick will kill me.

94
00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:14,916
- You hate your stepdad.

95
00:05:16,928 --> 00:05:19,306
There is no way that they
would be able to find out.

96
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:20,319
They're out of the country.

97
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,456
How are they gonna know?

98
00:05:21,456 --> 00:05:23,327
- Look Oliver, it's clear
she doesn't wanna go

99
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,268
and that's fine.

100
00:05:24,268 --> 00:05:25,101
- No, I wanna go.

101
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:27,097
I just don't wanna take the RV.

102
00:05:27,097 --> 00:05:29,379
- Stacey, you said
yourself that the one thing

103
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:30,824
that you wanted to do when you left school

104
00:05:30,824 --> 00:05:32,214
was a road trip.

105
00:05:32,214 --> 00:05:34,059
Babe, this is our chance.

106
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:35,801
We just need the RV.

107
00:05:37,363 --> 00:05:38,933
I can drive.

108
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:40,431
I drove that truck that one time.

109
00:05:40,431 --> 00:05:41,463
- That was a pickup truck.

110
00:05:41,463 --> 00:05:43,462
- Yeah, it was a big one though.

111
00:05:43,462 --> 00:05:45,005
How much harder can an RV be?

112
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:46,169
- A lot harder.

113
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:48,000
- [Oliver] Hey Bray, you've
driven trucks before.

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,105
- [Bray] No, not this big.

115
00:05:49,105 --> 00:05:50,722
- Dude, whose side are you on?

116
00:05:52,924 --> 00:05:54,699
(sighs) Stacey.

117
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:56,738
- They would kill me
if I even scratched it.

118
00:05:56,738 --> 00:05:58,582
- We won't!

119
00:05:58,582 --> 00:05:59,934
We could teach you too.

120
00:05:59,934 --> 00:06:01,804
My car would have been
too cramped anyways.

121
00:06:01,804 --> 00:06:04,124
I mean it's gonna be for one week.

122
00:06:04,124 --> 00:06:05,441
- No, it's too risky.

123
00:06:05,441 --> 00:06:08,036
- But think of all the
places we could have sex!

124
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:09,985
- Forget it dude, let's find another way.

125
00:06:11,068 --> 00:06:12,515
- Give me one second, all right?

126
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:13,540
I've got this.

127
00:06:20,277 --> 00:06:24,511
(phone ringing)

128
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:27,053
- Hello?

129
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,685
- You're going to Summerland.

130
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:30,058
- What?

131
00:06:30,058 --> 00:06:31,534
Taylor, I could barely hear you.

132
00:06:31,534 --> 00:06:33,016
- Summerland.

133
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:34,188
I just heard, you're going.

134
00:06:34,188 --> 00:06:35,508
Why are you going?

135
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:37,444
- The bands?

136
00:06:37,444 --> 00:06:38,635
- Is that a question?

137
00:06:38,635 --> 00:06:39,991
You hate music.

138
00:06:39,991 --> 00:06:41,146
- [Bray] No I don't.

139
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:43,700
- It's that guy, isn't it?

140
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,262
- No, I just really wanna go.

141
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,006
- [Taylor] It's not gonna work out.

142
00:06:50,006 --> 00:06:52,867
- [Bray] Yes it is, we have a connection.

143
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:54,457
- What?

144
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:56,407
He's into girls.

145
00:06:56,407 --> 00:06:58,318
- No, he's gay, trust me.

146
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,491
He wears a promise ring.

147
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:03,579
- (scoffs) You weren't kidding.

148
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:06,976
- Yeah like what kind of 18 year old jock

149
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:09,776
hasn't slept with a dozen cheerleaders?

150
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:11,361
- [Taylor] So what girl are you using?

151
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:15,328
- [Bray] Oliver's girlfriend.

152
00:07:15,328 --> 00:07:17,277
- [Taylor] You fucking idiot.

153
00:07:18,235 --> 00:07:20,270
- All right, fine, we'll do it.

154
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,811
But full tank when we return it

155
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:23,698
and you guys are also cleaning it.

156
00:07:23,698 --> 00:07:26,393
Oh, and we're driving up to
Fossil Falls and camping.

157
00:07:26,393 --> 00:07:27,559
Tonight.

158
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,338
- What did you say to her?

159
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:43,421
- You owe me.

160
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,024

161
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:11,237
We're gonna get so fucked!

162
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,172
- Hey, stop!

163
00:08:47,758 --> 00:08:50,668
- Look, we were always
gonna stop along the way.

164
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:53,018
We weren't just gonna drive
straight there, were we?

165
00:08:53,018 --> 00:08:54,353
- The festival starts on Thursday.

166
00:08:54,353 --> 00:08:56,094
We're going literally
the opposite direction.

167
00:08:56,094 --> 00:08:58,637
- Yeah, all right, you fucking fun sponge.

168
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:00,859
So we'll leave early in the morning.

169
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:02,176
Is that okay with you?

170
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:08,071
She just really wants to see this place.

171
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:09,695
Means a lot to her.

172
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,742
We wouldn't even be doing this road trip

173
00:09:12,742 --> 00:09:14,915
if it weren't for her.

174
00:09:14,915 --> 00:09:16,133
I'm just saying.

175
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:17,974
- All right, only for one night though.

00:09:23,902 --> 00:09:25,444
What's with the cassette?

177
00:09:25,444 --> 00:09:26,949
- Uh, Audio books.

178
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:29,741
I think her dad gave
them to her or something.

179
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,047
Still talking to your man?

180
00:09:36,047 --> 00:09:36,880

186
00:10:02,325 --> 00:10:04,047
- Who are you most excited for?

187
00:10:04,047 --> 00:10:05,655
- For what?

188
00:10:05,655 --> 00:10:07,088
- The festival.

189
00:10:07,088 --> 00:10:08,463
- Oh, um.

190
00:10:08,463 --> 00:10:09,477
I'm not really sure.

191
00:10:09,477 --> 00:10:11,645
Just, you know, the experience.

192
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:12,895
- Got it, yeah.

193
00:10:14,015 --> 00:10:15,490
- Where's this guy?

194
00:10:17,931 --> 00:10:19,835
- Oliver said that you're
meeting a guy there.

195
00:10:20,693 --> 00:10:22,414
- Yup.

196
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:23,247
- That's so cool.

197
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,850
So you two met online, right?

198
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,029
- Yeah, on a dating website.

199
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:27,862
- Nice.

200
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,204
You guys have like, never met before?

201
00:10:32,204 --> 00:10:33,517
- No.

202
00:10:33,517 --> 00:10:34,812
I mean we will though.

203
00:10:34,812 --> 00:10:35,902
Just not yet.

204
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:38,150
- Oh my god I'm so excited to meet him.

205
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,475
Are you nervous?

206
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:42,786
- Yeah you could say that.

207
00:10:42,786 --> 00:10:45,802
(phone ringing)

208
00:10:45,802 --> 00:10:47,469
- Yo, where are you?

209
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,610
- (laughing) Oliver my boy, how are you?

210
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,214
- I'm on the 90, that road you told me

211
00:10:53,214 --> 00:10:54,158
to pull onto.

212
00:10:54,158 --> 00:10:55,674
- Yeah I know.

213
00:10:55,674 --> 00:10:57,089
We're right behind you.

214
00:10:58,631 --> 00:11:00,331
Yeah, you're in the RV.

215
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,320
- Wait, how did you find us?

216
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,600
Where do you wanna stop and meet?

217
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,126
- Ah, we don't do that anymore.

218
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:09,084
- What, meet?

219
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:11,642
- Nah, we don't stop.

220
00:11:11,642 --> 00:11:12,859
You don't get my emails?

221
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:14,511
- Dude, what does that mean?

222
00:11:14,511 --> 00:11:16,762
- Hah, can't get caught
if you're going fast.

223
00:11:16,762 --> 00:11:18,198
International waters.

224
00:11:18,198 --> 00:11:20,948
Nothing's illegal at 90
miles an hour! (laughing)

225
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:24,043
Hey pull up around here.

226
00:11:24,043 --> 00:11:25,726
Looks like we got a break ahead.

227
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:32,643
- [Stacey] What's going on?

228
00:11:33,768 --> 00:11:34,994
- Oliver, who is that?

229
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,919
- Nothing, I'm just hooking us up.

230
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,723
- Hey Oliver, what's up?

231
00:11:46,723 --> 00:11:47,691
- What are you doing?!

232
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:50,468
- Just driving fast. (laughing)

233
00:11:50,468 --> 00:11:52,476
Got you a little bit of everything.

234
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:53,614
Plus a little extra,

235
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:54,964
'cause I know you're leaving and all.

236
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,313
(laughing)

237
00:11:57,598 --> 00:11:58,616
I'm gonna miss ya.

238
00:11:58,616 --> 00:11:59,670
- Yeah.

239
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,670
Fuck!
(car honking)

240
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,865
- So you guys going to like
a festival or something?

241
00:12:07,865 --> 00:12:08,957
- Hey dude!

242
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:13,637
- All right, throw the money.

243
00:12:13,637 --> 00:12:14,677
- Wait, what?

244
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:16,081
- Throw me the money!

245
00:12:16,923 --> 00:12:18,675
Throw me the money!

246
00:12:18,675 --> 00:12:20,072
Throw me the money!

247
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,710
- Come on!

248
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,037
- Throw it, throw me the money.

249
00:12:23,037 --> 00:12:24,408
Throw, throw, throw, throw!

250
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:25,907
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

251
00:12:25,907 --> 00:12:26,740
Ugh!

252
00:12:28,572 --> 00:12:29,991
- Sorry!

253
00:12:29,991 --> 00:12:32,024
- Ugh, Oliver you fucker!

254
00:12:32,024 --> 00:12:33,966
- You fucker!

255
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:35,803
- Shit!

256
00:12:40,275 --> 00:12:42,475
- I don't even know what half these are.

257
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:44,112
- [Oliver] Try one, see what happens.

258
00:12:46,687 --> 00:12:48,104
- What are these?

259
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:51,325
- Are these poppers?

260
00:12:51,325 --> 00:12:53,350
- You're welcome.

261
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,518
- What are poppers?

262
00:12:54,518 --> 00:12:56,760
- They're like an aphrodisiac.

263
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:01,859
- What is this?

264
00:13:01,859 --> 00:13:03,633
- Uh.

265
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:05,305
- Oh, I actually don't know.

266
00:13:05,305 --> 00:13:08,021
Christian always throws
in extra shit for me.

267
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,668
He said don't take that
unless you have at least

268
00:13:10,668 --> 00:13:12,401
a solid 12 hours to burn.

269
00:13:14,157 --> 00:13:15,423
Or was it 24?

270
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:24,068
(chill hip hop music)

271
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,240
- It's this right here.

272
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,905
It's been like four years

273
00:14:09,905 --> 00:14:11,583
since I was here last with my family.

274
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,606
We used to come up every spring.

275
00:14:13,606 --> 00:14:15,332
- Why don't we just stay in the RV?

276
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:16,724
- I mean you can.

277
00:14:19,103 --> 00:14:20,540
Nice catch, idiot.

278
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,373
- Fuck RVs.

279
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:24,143
Rick always bring that
massive house into the woods.

280
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:26,127
Defeats the entire purpose.

281
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:37,363
- So salmon can only swim upstream.

282
00:14:38,803 --> 00:14:41,289
Whoa, they can swim up that waterfall.

283
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:43,179
- Ollie, no, what the hell
is that book telling you?

284
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:45,453
They can't swim from
up that, it's massive.

285
00:14:45,453 --> 00:14:47,226
You can cliff jump over there though.

286
00:14:47,226 --> 00:14:49,237
My cousin used to give me so
much shit for not jumping.

287
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:50,070
- Oh yeah?

288
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,185
You're doing it with me
this time though, right?

289
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,383
Damn, I haven't even
seen a waterfall before.

290
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:01,858
We could swim with the salmon!

291
00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:04,133
- Don't they have waterfalls in England?

292
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:06,091
- No, not really.

293
00:15:06,091 --> 00:15:08,119
- Isn't it an island though?

294
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:10,108
- I mean technically,
everything's an island.

295
00:15:10,108 --> 00:15:11,918
- Oliver, no.

296
00:15:11,918 --> 00:15:13,052
- Are you still thinking of going back

297
00:15:13,052 --> 00:15:14,656
to visit this summer?

298
00:15:14,656 --> 00:15:16,720
- Uh, Yeah.

299
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,012
Yeah, I think so.

300
00:15:18,012 --> 00:15:19,173
- Man, I'd love to come with you.

301
00:15:19,173 --> 00:15:20,839
I've never seen Europe before.

302
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:22,273
- Europe's cool.

303
00:15:25,506 --> 00:15:26,756
I have an idea.

304
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:32,996
Well I was gonna save
them for the festival but

305
00:15:32,996 --> 00:15:35,578
I think we should do them right now.

306
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:37,901
- I don't know dude,
those are pretty crazy.

307
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:39,596
- [Oliver] Nah, it's just like weed.

308
00:15:39,596 --> 00:15:41,973
- It doesn't look like weed.

309
00:15:41,973 --> 00:15:42,860
- Well I'll roll them in a joint

310
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,329
and it'll look just like weed.

311
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:46,459
- You know that doesn't work, right?

312
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:48,367
- Right, why don't we save
them for the festival?

313
00:15:58,473 --> 00:16:00,365
- I guess we're doing them then.

314
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:07,574
- All right, fuck it.

315
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:12,864
- Mmm.

316
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:18,562
(light guitar music)

317
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:48,323
(Oliver hooting)

318
00:17:55,754 --> 00:17:56,587
- Oliver?

319
00:17:59,421 --> 00:18:00,721
Oliver!

320
00:18:02,406 --> 00:18:04,489
Bray, I can't find Ollie.

321
00:18:08,177 --> 00:18:11,414
(phone ringing)

322
00:18:11,414 --> 00:18:12,247
- [Oliver] Hello?

323
00:18:12,247 --> 00:18:13,622
- [Stacey] Ugh, Oliver, where are you?

324
00:18:13,622 --> 00:18:15,140
- [Oliver] Oh, fuck it,
just leave a message.

325
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,983
(beeping)
- God dammit.

326
00:18:18,574 --> 00:18:19,761
- You gotta admit this is pretty funny.

327
00:18:19,761 --> 00:18:20,631
- No it's not.

328
00:18:20,631 --> 00:18:22,348
He's always pulling this shit.

329
00:18:27,921 --> 00:18:30,535
- I am the Salmon King!

330
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:33,285
(water crashing)

331
00:18:46,216 --> 00:18:48,880
I'm coming up the
waterfall to be with you!

332
00:18:50,238 --> 00:18:52,271
Wait for me, salmon brothers!

333
00:18:53,271 --> 00:18:54,379
Wait for me!

334
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:56,451
- Let's go up.

335
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:05,327
I can't do it.

336
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:07,371
It's higher than I remember.

337
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:10,658
- No, you're just taller.

338
00:19:10,658 --> 00:19:12,078
You'll be fine.

339
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:13,113
The falling's the easy part.

340
00:19:13,113 --> 00:19:14,596
All you have to do is jump.

341
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,597
- No, I don't wanna get
hurt before the festival.

342
00:19:18,597 --> 00:19:19,847
I'm going down.

343
00:19:21,554 --> 00:19:22,827
(screaming)

344
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:25,160
(splashing)

345
00:19:27,947 --> 00:19:29,981
Fuck you, Oliver!

346
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,586
- Now tell me that wasn't fun!

347
00:19:38,605 --> 00:19:40,013
- What are you doing?

348
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,713
- What does it look like?

349
00:19:49,778 --> 00:19:50,611
(screaming)

350
00:19:50,611 --> 00:19:52,861
(splashing)

351
00:19:52,861 --> 00:19:54,353
- All right, fuck it.

352
00:19:58,784 --> 00:20:00,005
(screaming)

353
00:20:00,005 --> 00:20:02,338
(splashing)

354
00:20:51,863 --> 00:20:54,446
(mystic music)

355
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:02,696
- Thanks for opening up my new world bray.

356
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:03,872
Come to me.

357
00:21:29,156 --> 00:21:31,259
(Oliver snoring)

358
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:32,934
- Dude, what the fuck?

359
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:53,656
We should get going.

360
00:21:53,656 --> 00:21:55,132
It's almost 10 already.

361
00:21:57,007 --> 00:22:00,785
- (sighing) I always forget
how much those do you.

362
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:03,393
Fucking great.

363
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:10,624
Oh fuck.

364
00:22:10,624 --> 00:22:12,632
- Isn't that Stacey's phone?

365
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:14,381
- Yeah, I thought it was mine.

366
00:22:15,648 --> 00:22:17,180
- What are you doing?

367
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,205
Damn.

368
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,200
I won't say anything.

369
00:22:37,044 --> 00:22:39,017
- Hey, have you seen my phone?

370
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:40,223
I can't find it anywhere.

371
00:22:40,223 --> 00:22:42,473
I know I had it when I came back though.

372
00:22:42,473 --> 00:22:43,489
- Yeah.

373
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:46,215
You left it by the water.

374
00:22:47,331 --> 00:22:48,381
- Weird.

375
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,996
- We should get going.

376
00:22:58,739 --> 00:23:01,156
- Shotgun, not doing the tent.

377
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,863

382
00:23:25,482 --> 00:23:27,133
I missed a call from Rick.

383
00:23:29,739 --> 00:23:31,396
- Well I wouldn't freak out about it.

384
00:23:31,396 --> 00:23:32,949
He's probably just checking in.

385
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:35,649
- No, I feel like he knows.

386
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:37,958
- [Oliver] How would he know?

387
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,062
He's out of the country.

388
00:23:40,062 --> 00:23:42,502
- You're being paranoid, you're fine.

00:23:46,703 --> 00:23:49,253
- Hey, I know what will
get your mind off of it.

390
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,242
It's just like a car.

391
00:23:54,242 --> 00:23:55,982
Just a little bit bigger.

392
00:23:55,982 --> 00:23:57,468
- I'm gonna crash this thing.

393
00:23:57,468 --> 00:23:59,738
- No, all you have to worry
about is your turn radius.

394
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,012
If you turn too sharp,
you'll hit something.

395
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:01,845
- I don't know.

396
00:24:01,845 --> 00:24:04,065
Maybe you guys should just keep driving.

397
00:24:04,065 --> 00:24:06,171
- You have to learn sometime.

398
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:07,702
Come on.

399
00:24:07,702 --> 00:24:09,035
Put it in drive.

400
00:24:11,214 --> 00:24:13,305
Whoa whoa whoa, foot on the brake!

401
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:19,687
Okay, Okay, see?

402
00:24:19,687 --> 00:24:21,313
Easy, you have this.

403
00:24:37,505 --> 00:24:38,505
- Not today.

404
00:24:39,606 --> 00:24:42,093
- The idea of picking up
a hitchhiker is so scary.

405
00:24:42,093 --> 00:24:43,103
- It is.

406
00:24:43,103 --> 00:24:45,484
You should never pick up a hitchhiker.

407
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,603
I did once and I ended up
doing crack by accident.

408
00:24:48,603 --> 00:24:51,477
- How do you do crack by accident?

409
00:24:51,477 --> 00:24:53,752
- Well nobody ever does crack on purpose.

410
00:25:18,658 --> 00:25:20,142
- Yo, Bray, what's up?

411
00:25:20,142 --> 00:25:21,246
- Hey.
- Bray, right?

412
00:25:21,246 --> 00:25:22,079
- Yeah, how's it going?

413
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:23,103
- [Man] Oh, is that her?

414
00:25:23,103 --> 00:25:24,778
- No it's not her, it's her friend.

415
00:25:24,778 --> 00:25:27,369
It's good, we're just still driving

416
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:28,373
crammed in the back here.

417
00:25:28,373 --> 00:25:30,073
- That looks awful.

418
00:25:30,073 --> 00:25:33,649
- Where's Victoria, still driving?

419
00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:35,206
- Yeah, she hasn't crashed yet.

420
00:25:35,206 --> 00:25:36,623
- Let me see her.

421
00:25:39,334 --> 00:25:40,417
- Yeah, okay.

422
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:47,709
Yo, say hi.

423
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:48,777
- What?

424
00:25:48,777 --> 00:25:50,363
- Yo, what's up!?

425
00:25:50,363 --> 00:25:52,332
- [Man] Yo, she's hot!

426
00:25:52,332 --> 00:25:53,922
- Dude, she's driving!

427
00:25:53,922 --> 00:25:55,005
- Okay, okay.

428
00:25:56,572 --> 00:25:57,536
See what I mean?

429
00:25:57,536 --> 00:25:59,302
Safety hazard behind that wheel.

430
00:25:59,302 --> 00:26:01,660
- Cool, well, just tell Vic to text me

431
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,122
when she's not driving, okay?

432
00:26:03,122 --> 00:26:04,140
- Yeah, for sure.

433
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:04,973
- Sweet.

434
00:26:04,973 --> 00:26:06,577
Hey, I'm stoked to meet you too, man.

435
00:26:06,577 --> 00:26:09,521
Summerland's gonna be sick!

436
00:26:09,521 --> 00:26:11,112
- See you soon, Shawn.

437
00:26:16,717 --> 00:26:20,259
- [Oliver] Holy shit, it
just keeps going and going.

438
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:22,242
- What did you expect, it's a huge bus.

439
00:26:25,486 --> 00:26:26,467
- Are you sure you're gonna be all right

440
00:26:26,467 --> 00:26:27,968
paying all of this?

441
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,779
- I don't care, it's Rick's money.

442
00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:31,021
For someone who loves Ram Dass so much

443
00:26:31,021 --> 00:26:32,979
he should be happy I'm getting rid of it.

444
00:26:35,891 --> 00:26:38,738
- [Oliver] God, you're beautiful.

445
00:26:38,738 --> 00:26:40,229
What?

446
00:26:40,229 --> 00:26:42,726
Is this my jumper, did you steal this?

447
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,886
- She still doesn't know.

448
00:26:44,886 --> 00:26:46,619
- She can't know.

449
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:48,101
- Well that's the plan.

450
00:26:48,101 --> 00:26:49,499
- Well, Bray, if that's the plan,

451
00:26:49,499 --> 00:26:51,896
you have both of them going
to the same music festival.

452
00:26:51,896 --> 00:26:54,304
- Yeah and I'm working
on a way to tell Shawn

453
00:26:54,304 --> 00:26:56,294
that Victoria died on the way there.

454
00:26:56,294 --> 00:26:58,140
- Yeah, that'll work perfectly.

455
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,070
- Look, I'll break off on my own

456
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,086
and I'll find him before she does.

457
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:06,510
- Bray, you're in so deep.

458
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,190
So deep, deep, deep down in your own

459
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,581
dark moist hole.

460
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:13,044
I mean listen!

461
00:27:13,044 --> 00:27:14,882
You, pretending to be Stacey.

462
00:27:14,882 --> 00:27:16,567
Stacey going to the festival.

463
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:19,242
Shawn looking for Stacey at the festival.

464
00:27:19,242 --> 00:27:20,620
- I get it, Taylor.

465
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,746
- I don't know if you do.

466
00:27:22,746 --> 00:27:23,941
I mean how are you not a ball

467
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:26,570
of complete anxiety right now?

468
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:28,552
I mean what even is it about this guy?

469
00:27:28,552 --> 00:27:29,707
- He's special.

470
00:27:29,707 --> 00:27:32,556
Even if he's not gay, we
really have something.

471
00:27:32,556 --> 00:27:34,566
I'm Victoria, not Stacey.

472
00:27:34,566 --> 00:27:38,067
- Are you fucking listening to yourself?

473
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:38,900
- I know.

474
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:43,975
I have a plan.

475
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:52,545
- You sure you don't want one?

476
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,378
- I can't.

477
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:56,744
- So you've never had meat?

478
00:27:56,744 --> 00:27:57,675
- I wasn't allowed it growing up

479
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:58,550
so don't really miss it.

480
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,575
- Can't miss something you've never tried.

481
00:28:03,154 --> 00:28:05,038
- I'm gonna go see if they have salad.

482
00:28:11,308 --> 00:28:12,408
- This ain't bad.

483
00:28:12,408 --> 00:28:15,070
- I couldn't live without meat.

484
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,011
Don't say anything.

485
00:28:17,011 --> 00:28:17,844
Don't.

- So, Seattle?

498
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:19,762
- There was a science fair

499
00:29:19,762 --> 00:29:24,048
and a bunch of different schools
stayed at the same hotel so

500
00:29:24,048 --> 00:29:26,983
you know naturally there
are a couple of parties.

501
00:29:26,983 --> 00:29:30,765

00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:32,331
that's about it.

503
00:29:34,213 --> 00:29:35,188
- Great.

504
00:29:40,295 --> 00:29:42,395
- I mean this was years ago!

505
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:51,888
Should we go up?

506
00:29:51,888 --> 00:29:53,376
- I'm a little tired.

507
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:55,027

- What does that have to do with anything?

511
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:15,483
- [Bray] That just surprises me.

512
00:30:15,483 --> 00:30:16,511
- Why?

513
00:30:16,511 --> 00:30:18,236
- It's kind of a big deal.

515
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,515

- That was Khephra, new friend.

529
00:31:05,586 --> 00:31:08,648
- I'm not going to some
weird Grindr party.

530

- Why are we getting her the beer?

533
00:31:19,508 --> 00:31:21,601
- Because I pissed her off.

534
00:31:21,601 --> 00:31:23,262
I have to make it up to her somehow.

535
00:31:23,262 --> 00:31:24,399

She didn't say anything.

00:31:59,437 --> 00:32:01,328
I tried it but it was not for me.

549
00:32:01,328 --> 00:32:02,161
- Mmm.

550
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:05,719
I believe it is the
best way to meet people.

551
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:09,840
How else are you going
to be able to connect

552
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,831
with other boys?

553
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:19,194
I met half the people here on Grindr.

554
00:32:19,194 --> 00:32:20,419
- Called it.

555
00:32:21,463 --> 00:32:22,746
Okay, well.

556
00:32:22,746 --> 00:32:24,866
- Yeah I just thought the
party could use some beers.

557
00:32:24,866 --> 00:32:26,956
- [Stacey] That was so thoughtful of you.

558
00:32:26,956 --> 00:32:29,434
What's the wood for?

559
00:32:29,434 --> 00:32:30,674
- It's a useful tool.

560
00:32:30,674 --> 00:32:32,299
- I will be right back.

561
00:32:34,045 --> 00:32:35,378
- [Stacey] Okay.

562
00:32:36,365 --> 00:32:37,298
- Hey man.

563
00:32:39,601 --> 00:32:41,232
- And you?

564
00:32:41,232 --> 00:32:42,065
- Me what?

565
00:32:43,481 --> 00:32:45,237
- How do you connect?

566
00:32:45,237 --> 00:32:47,434
- I don't know, I believe
in just meeting people

567
00:32:47,434 --> 00:32:48,738
in real life,

568
00:32:48,738 --> 00:32:50,260
finding something real.

569
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,856
- (chuckling) Bray.

570
00:32:53,856 --> 00:32:55,443
Welcome to the 21st century.

571
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:57,641
There are much faster ways.

572
00:32:57,641 --> 00:33:01,791
And believe me, I've had my fair share of

573
00:33:02,974 --> 00:33:05,734
real experiences.

574
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:08,458
- No, see, I don't just
want some experience.

575
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:10,266
I want a real connection.

576
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,865
- Bray, look into my eyes.

577
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,193
(whooshing)

578
00:33:20,855 --> 00:33:25,855
There is connection in experience, Bray.

579
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:29,935
You just have to let loose.

580
00:33:29,935 --> 00:33:33,331
Trust yourself, Bray.

581
00:33:33,331 --> 00:33:36,146
You'll find your connection.

582
00:33:36,146 --> 00:33:38,538
Just don't try so hard.

583
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:41,768
- What are you doing to me?

584
00:33:46,737 --> 00:33:48,870
- You're a gay man, Bray.

585
00:33:51,283 --> 00:33:53,070
So gay.

586
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,469
Gay, Bray.

587
00:33:57,021 --> 00:33:58,604
Gay Bray, gay Bray.

588
00:34:01,092 --> 00:34:01,925
Gay.

589
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:05,158
Gay.

590
00:34:05,158 --> 00:34:06,566
So gay.

591
00:34:07,896 --> 00:34:08,729
- Yeah.

592
00:34:09,683 --> 00:34:10,874
Gay Bray.

593
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:17,432
- You're finally free, Bray.

594
00:34:19,885 --> 00:34:21,085
- Oh, no.

595
00:34:31,744 --> 00:34:35,052
(Stacey moaning)

596
00:34:38,424 --> 00:34:40,382
Oh god I'm going to spunk.

597
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:43,456
You guys just left me.

598
00:34:44,401 --> 00:34:45,600
- Oh, hey Bray.
- What's wrong?

599
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,639
Thought you were gonna fuck that dude.

600
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,936
- No, I'm a bottom.

601
00:34:48,936 --> 00:34:51,620
And it turned out he's a
magical gay wizard or something.

602
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,422
- Oh wow.
- Sounds cool.

603
00:34:53,422 --> 00:34:55,063
- What, no!

604
00:34:55,063 --> 00:34:57,198
I mean yeah it's kinda cool but

605
00:34:57,198 --> 00:34:59,836
I don't wanna lose my
virginity to a wizard.

606
00:34:59,836 --> 00:35:01,752
- Wait, you're a virgin?

607
00:35:01,752 --> 00:35:03,369
- Yeah, so?

608
00:35:04,488 --> 00:35:06,071
Look, I don't wanna have sex with a guy

609
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:08,222
who only cares about my body.

610
00:35:08,222 --> 00:35:09,304
Why does it seem like every guy

611
00:35:09,304 --> 00:35:11,091
just wants sex?

612
00:35:11,091 --> 00:35:12,883
You know, nobody wants to just talk

613
00:35:12,883 --> 00:35:16,958
or take me out, get to know me.

614
00:35:18,813 --> 00:35:21,384
It's like nobody wants a
meaningful relationship.

615
00:35:23,068 --> 00:35:24,460
(snoring)

616
00:35:32,616 --> 00:35:35,273
- [Stacey] I don't understand,
how would they reach?

617
00:35:35,273 --> 00:35:36,858
- [Oliver] Well they have such long necks.

618
00:35:36,858 --> 00:35:39,258
- Yeah but they just
like swing them around.

619
00:35:39,258 --> 00:35:41,690
- No, no, no, they open
their legs super wide

620
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,332
and then they lower their
heads all the way down

621
00:35:43,332 --> 00:35:44,736
to the ground.

622
00:35:44,736 --> 00:35:45,844
Bray, you know this.

623
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:47,824
There's more gay giraffes
than there are straight ones.

624
00:35:47,824 --> 00:35:50,499
- Like they don't even care
about repopulating the species,

625
00:35:50,499 --> 00:35:51,462
and still have sex with their bros?

626
00:35:51,462 --> 00:35:52,718
- Oliver, you know you have to let me.

627
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:54,540
- That's amazing.
- Write this one down.

628
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,672
- Whoa, okay.

629
00:35:55,672 --> 00:35:56,521
Bed time?

630
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:57,379
- Yeah.

631
00:35:57,379 --> 00:35:58,431
- Come on.

632
00:35:58,431 --> 00:36:00,297
Move that leg, that would help me.

633
00:36:00,297 --> 00:36:02,280
Bray, maybe some help?

634
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:04,613
Let's do bedtime.

635
00:36:04,613 --> 00:36:05,446
How does bedtime sound?

636
00:36:05,446 --> 00:36:07,015
Hello.
(thudding)

637
00:36:07,015 --> 00:36:08,282
- I'm fine.

638
00:36:09,915 --> 00:36:12,282
- If you're drunk in this bed,

639
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,345
I'm gonna kick your ass.

640
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,350
Go to bed, babe, you're drunk.

641
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,766
The ingredients of a one gram tube

642
00:36:21,766 --> 00:36:24,082
of Oscillococcinum are listed as

643
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:26,201
- I want my audiobooks.

644
00:36:26,201 --> 00:36:28,148
- Stacey, you're drunk.

645
00:36:28,148 --> 00:36:29,981
- I wanna learn stuff.

646
00:36:31,734 --> 00:36:32,833
- Just fucking give them to her.

647
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:33,666
- Okay.

648
00:36:35,644 --> 00:36:36,994
I'm going to bed.

649
00:36:42,715 --> 00:36:45,489
- So is everything all
right with your guy?

650
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:46,489
- Yeah, why?

651
00:36:48,484 --> 00:36:49,901
- Just wondering.

652
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,832
I'll see you tomorrow then.

653
00:36:57,832 --> 00:36:58,915
- Good night.

654
00:37:00,741 --> 00:37:02,199
- Good night, Bray.

become the gay capital of America?

693
00:40:29,001 --> 00:40:30,885
- Since the military
discharged all the gays

694
00:40:30,885 --> 00:40:31,822
from Vietnam here.

695
00:40:31,822 --> 00:40:33,060

696
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,298
- This was the closest port.

697
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:35,410
So if they found out you were gay,

698
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:36,288
they just leave you here and

699
00:40:36,288 --> 00:40:37,960
nobody wanted to go back to their families

700
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,168

- Really?

706
00:40:50,538 --> 00:40:51,898
- Yeah, when you grow up your whole life

707
00:40:51,898 --> 00:40:54,899
in a small town thinking
you're the only one,

708
00:40:54,899 --> 00:40:56,561
suddenly there's a parade of us.

709
00:40:57,562 --> 00:41:00,221
- (laughing) Gayborhood.

710
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:05,180

711
00:41:19,669 --> 00:41:21,598
60 pillars.

714
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:52,800
- [Bray] Should we get going?

715
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,633
- Why?

716
00:41:54,507 --> 00:41:56,023
Why are you in such a rush?

717
00:41:56,023 --> 00:41:57,490
- [Bray] Well, sun's going down soon and

718
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:59,344
I wanna be there for early check-in.

719
00:41:59,344 --> 00:42:02,253
- Why are you always in such a hurry?

720
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:05,470
Just enjoy this insane view.

721
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,448
- Bray's right, babe,

722
00:42:06,448 --> 00:42:07,493
it's gonna fill up soon.

723
00:42:07,493 --> 00:42:09,253
Everyone's going there today.

724
00:42:09,253 --> 00:42:10,637
- Dude, all we need is a parking spot.

725
00:42:10,637 --> 00:42:13,082
It's not like we're setting
up some massive camp.

726
00:42:13,082 --> 00:42:14,765
There'll be enough room.

727
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:16,828
- Yeah, well you wanna get
there at like four a.m.

728
00:42:16,828 --> 00:42:19,265
I'd rather not sleep in on the first day.

729
00:42:19,265 --> 00:42:21,718
- Why is this such an issue?

730
00:42:21,718 --> 00:42:24,177
We have an RV, just sleep on the way.

731
00:42:25,235 --> 00:42:28,335
Can we just enjoy this
trip for one minute?

732
00:42:28,335 --> 00:42:29,476
Fucking hell.

733
00:42:45,784 --> 00:42:48,352
- Hey, you sure you're okay to drive?

734
00:42:48,352 --> 00:42:50,010
- Yeah, of course.

735
00:42:51,273 --> 00:42:52,864
It's only seven or eight hours.

736
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:59,712
You two should go sleep.

737
00:42:59,712 --> 00:43:02,321
Especially him, he needs his beauty rest.

738
00:43:03,712 --> 00:43:04,962
- You're right.

739
00:43:06,306 --> 00:43:07,270
- I'm fine.

740
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:08,488
- I know.

741
00:43:08,488 --> 00:43:09,715
I love you.

742
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:11,572
- I know.

743
00:43:17,747 --> 00:43:20,247
- A few more hours but we're almost there.

744
00:43:20,247 --> 00:43:21,080
(sighing)

745
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,320
- We should go back sometime.

746
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,847
I really like it there.

747
00:43:23,847 --> 00:43:25,860
- Yeah, you seem to know a lot about it.

748
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,628
- Yeah, to be honest I was
kind of obsessed with it

749
00:43:27,628 --> 00:43:29,031
for a while.

750
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:31,562
After I stopped caring
what my parents thought.

751
00:43:31,562 --> 00:43:32,800
- Do they not support you?

752
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,004
- No, not at all.

753
00:43:35,004 --> 00:43:37,075
My mom knew, 'cause moms
just know everything.

754
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:37,908
- Yeah.

755
00:43:37,908 --> 00:43:40,331
- My dad did not take it well at all.

756
00:43:40,331 --> 00:43:41,164
- No?

757
00:43:41,164 --> 00:43:43,778
- No, he sent me to a gay conversion camp.

758
00:43:43,778 --> 00:43:46,901
- My god, I always wondered
what those were like.

759
00:43:46,901 --> 00:43:48,152
- I don't know whose idea it was

760
00:43:48,152 --> 00:43:49,519
to send a bunch of sexually confused boys

761
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:50,788
to camp together,

762
00:43:50,788 --> 00:43:52,063
but I had a great time.

763
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:55,521
- [Stacey] Oh my god. (laughing)

764
00:43:55,521 --> 00:43:58,579
- I met my first boyfriend there, Tracy.

765
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:00,428
- My god, what happened with that?

766
00:44:00,428 --> 00:44:02,698
- He broke up with me after we got out.

767
00:44:04,581 --> 00:44:07,626
- Do you think that camp had
anything to do with that?

768
00:44:07,626 --> 00:44:08,645
- I don't know.

769
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:11,145
I mean he has a girlfriend now so,

770
00:44:12,788 --> 00:44:14,178
- I'm sorry.

771
00:44:14,178 --> 00:44:16,293
- It wouldn't have worked out anyway.

772
00:44:16,293 --> 00:44:17,770
Long distance does not work.

773
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:19,992
- Yeah I don't see how two
people can make it work

774
00:44:19,992 --> 00:44:21,643
if they live in different cities.

775
00:44:21,643 --> 00:44:23,641
It just seems too difficult.

776
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:24,939
- Yeah.

777
00:44:24,939 --> 00:44:27,014
Are you guys gonna try and stick it out?

778
00:44:27,014 --> 00:44:29,609
- Oh yeah, like Oliver can
be a shithead sometimes, but,

779
00:44:29,609 --> 00:44:30,442
- Sometimes?

780
00:44:30,442 --> 00:44:32,071
(giggling)

781
00:44:32,071 --> 00:44:33,538
- But he means well.

782
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,881
He helped me a lot when
my mom married Rick.

783
00:44:37,881 --> 00:44:39,275
- Now, you really hate that guy.

784
00:44:39,275 --> 00:44:40,108
- Yeah.

785
00:44:41,489 --> 00:44:45,203
My mom used to be so happy
when my dad was around but

786
00:44:45,203 --> 00:44:47,802
I don't know she just seems so fake now.

787
00:44:47,802 --> 00:44:50,198
- What happened to your dad?

788
00:44:50,198 --> 00:44:52,248
- He passed away when I was 12.

789
00:44:54,163 --> 00:44:55,313
- I'm sorry.

790
00:44:57,402 --> 00:45:00,463
- I just need to get out
of that house, you know?

791
00:45:00,463 --> 00:45:01,396

804
00:45:36,264 --> 00:45:38,078
I often feel like I have a mask on

805
00:45:38,078 --> 00:45:40,889

people expect me to be.

my mom's gonna let me

895

move in with you after this?

896
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:19,623
- What?

897
00:49:20,896 --> 00:49:23,295
Dude, you still haven't told her?

898
00:49:23,295 --> 00:49:24,128
- What?

899
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:26,579
- His visa expired.

900
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:28,429
He has to move home in like two weeks.

901
00:49:31,622 --> 00:49:32,588
- What?

902
00:49:38,948 --> 00:49:40,755
- I was gonna tell you.

903
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:43,029
- What?

904
00:49:44,755 --> 00:49:46,705
- I mean it was gonna happen eventually.

905
00:49:48,456 --> 00:49:52,048
After I dropped out, they
wouldn't let me renew it.

906

difficult than I'd expect.

00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:01,264

909
00:50:02,331 --> 00:50:03,422

910
00:50:09,528 --> 00:50:11,278

00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:35,316
Why would you do that?

912
00:50:38,403 --> 00:50:40,617
You can't just drop shit on her like that.

913
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:45,409
You've kept your mouth
shut this entire time.

914
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:48,551
And now you choose to
just tell her everything?

915
00:50:50,192 --> 00:50:52,193
I didn't fucking rat you out.

916
00:50:52,193 --> 00:50:53,558
Pretending to be Stacey?

917
00:50:53,558 --> 00:50:55,600
Oh I'm sorry, Victoria?

918
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,555
This was never gonna fucking work.

919
00:51:02,824 --> 00:51:05,470
What did she think was gonna happen?

920
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:07,439
What, we're gonna get
married and fucking have kids

921
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:09,818
and live happily ever after?

922
00:51:09,818 --> 00:51:11,343
I'm on a visa!

923
00:51:13,522 --> 00:51:14,764
Why would she wanna live with me anyway?

924
00:51:14,764 --> 00:51:16,542
She lives in a big fuck off mansion.

925
00:51:16,542 --> 00:51:18,131
Know what, I actually don't give a fuck.

926
00:51:18,131 --> 00:51:20,248
She can just go and live with her stepdad.

927
00:51:22,907 --> 00:51:24,407
This is so unfair.

928
00:51:26,577 --> 00:51:30,205
I'm the one keeping this
entire trip together

929
00:51:30,205 --> 00:51:34,052
and I'm the one who's getting
kicked out. This country.

930
00:51:34,052 --> 00:51:36,135
This country is bullshit!

931
00:51:40,236 --> 00:51:44,521
(cars honking in distance)

932
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:47,104
(somber music)

933
00:51:48,492 --> 00:51:49,909
I don't wanna go.

934
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:52,979
I don't wanna leave.

935
00:51:57,427 --> 00:51:58,852
I wanna live with her.

936
00:52:03,805 --> 00:52:04,638
Fuck.

937
00:52:10,793 --> 00:52:13,591
(train horn blaring)

938
00:52:14,475 --> 00:52:16,727
Dude, I swear I parked it here.

939
00:52:16,727 --> 00:52:19,001
I mean I don't remember.

940
00:52:19,001 --> 00:52:20,809
You guys were here last.

941
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:24,284
Hey babe hey, it's Oliver.

942
00:52:25,409 --> 00:52:27,716
I can't see the RV, did you find it?

943
00:52:27,716 --> 00:52:29,475
- Dude, she ditched us.

944
00:52:33,076 --> 00:52:34,326
- Call me back.

945
00:52:35,882 --> 00:52:36,882
I'm sorry.

946
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,060
- What are we gonna do?

947
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,535
- It's fine, it's fine.

948
00:52:44,585 --> 00:52:47,115
We're not gonna be stuck here forever.

949
00:52:47,115 --> 00:52:49,015
- What if Shawn finds her?

950
00:52:51,955 --> 00:52:54,291
- Yeah, that's bad.

951
00:52:54,291 --> 00:52:56,325
- Do you know anyone in Vegas?

952
00:52:57,175 --> 00:52:58,808
- Bray, I'm from England.

953
00:53:04,775 --> 00:53:07,734
- [Oliver] I can't see
the RV, did you find it?

954
00:53:12,884 --> 00:53:14,067
Call me back.

955
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:16,533
I'm sorry.

956
00:53:25,409 --> 00:53:27,742

963

- What a mess.

964
00:53:53,479 --> 00:53:55,434
You probably should have told her.

965
00:53:55,434 --> 00:53:57,284
- You're the one that told me not to.

966
00:53:57,284 --> 00:53:59,243
- Yeah, but in this situation

967
00:53:59,243 --> 00:54:00,343
it would probably help if she knew

968
00:54:00,343 --> 00:54:01,849
what she was getting into.

969
00:54:02,857 --> 00:54:03,910
And you shouldn't have been in any

970
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:05,691
of their business, man.

971
00:54:05,691 --> 00:54:07,831
- Oliver's the one
straight up lying to her.

972
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:09,377
- You're lying to her.

973
00:54:09,377 --> 00:54:10,515
- That's different.

974
00:54:10,515 --> 00:54:11,348
- Is it?

975
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:12,181
- What?

976
00:54:12,181 --> 00:54:13,831
- Is it any different?

977
00:54:13,831 --> 00:54:16,549
- Yes, Oliver told her
they'd move in together.

978
00:54:16,549 --> 00:54:17,561
- What?

979
00:54:17,561 --> 00:54:18,789
- Move in together.

980
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:21,202
- You wanna move in together?

981
00:54:21,202 --> 00:54:22,268
- What?

982
00:54:22,268 --> 00:54:24,897
- I mean, sure, I guess.

983
00:54:24,897 --> 00:54:25,974
I haven't thought about it

984
00:54:25,974 --> 00:54:27,158
but I can start packing.

985
00:54:27,158 --> 00:54:28,580
I can pack my stuff right now.

986
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:32,483
(psychedelic music)

987
00:54:32,483 --> 00:54:33,359
- Where you going?

988
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:34,647
- To Summerland.

989
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:38,043
- Oliver?

990
00:54:38,043 --> 00:54:39,355
- Fuck off.

991
00:54:39,355 --> 00:54:41,333
- Haha, my man!

992
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:42,586
- [Oliver] Dude, what are you doing?

993
00:54:42,586 --> 00:54:44,653
- You know, we never really
got a chance to catch up

994
00:54:44,653 --> 00:54:46,522
so I figured.

995
00:54:46,522 --> 00:54:48,689
- You two know each other?

996
00:54:48,689 --> 00:54:50,639
The earth is so convenient.

997
00:54:51,709 --> 00:54:53,533
- This is Oliver, man.

998
00:54:53,533 --> 00:54:54,843
You guys still going to that festival?

999
00:54:54,843 --> 00:54:56,132
- Yeah, Summerland.

1000
00:54:56,132 --> 00:54:57,400
We got stranded.

1001
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,085
- Oh man, we'll take you.

1002
00:54:59,085 --> 00:55:01,732
Dude, they just said
they're going to Summerland.

1003
00:55:01,732 --> 00:55:02,855
Everyone's going to Summerland.

1004
00:55:02,855 --> 00:55:04,227
- Oh, no, man.

1005
00:55:04,227 --> 00:55:06,216
I told you, man.

1006
00:55:06,216 --> 00:55:08,718
I don't go public, I'm not doing--

1007
00:55:08,718 --> 00:55:10,906
- [Christian] These are the
guys I was telling you about.

1008
00:55:10,906 --> 00:55:11,952
- They threw your money?

1009
00:55:11,952 --> 00:55:12,785
- Yeah it was.

1010
00:55:12,785 --> 00:55:14,726
It's money under the bridge.

1011
00:55:17,077 --> 00:55:19,452
- You guys really have to go, don't you?

1012
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,261
All right, fuck it, get in.

1013
00:55:25,261 --> 00:55:26,263
Let's do this.

1014
00:55:26,263 --> 00:55:27,096
- Yes!

1015
00:55:27,096 --> 00:55:27,950
- Yes!

1016
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,825
- [Christian] Road trip!

1017
00:55:32,544 --> 00:55:33,798
(door shutting)

1018
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:34,715
Here we go!

(chill electronic music)

1021
00:56:48,577 --> 00:56:51,221
- Going to Summerland, woo!

1022
00:56:51,221 --> 00:56:53,755
- Yeah, Summerland!

1023
00:56:53,755 --> 00:56:55,696
You ever done crack?

1024
00:56:55,696 --> 00:56:57,404
- Woo!

1025
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,578
- She's at the festival.

1026
00:57:02,578 --> 00:57:04,014
- [Christian] Oh who's that, Stacey?

1027
00:57:04,014 --> 00:57:05,292
- Yeah.

1028
00:57:05,292 --> 00:57:07,126
Well, I mean.

1029
00:57:07,126 --> 00:57:08,143
It's complicated now.

1030
00:57:08,143 --> 00:57:09,732
She knows I have to go back.

1031
00:57:10,724 --> 00:57:12,180
- I left a girl once.

1032
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:13,189
For the road.

1033
00:57:13,189 --> 00:57:14,022
You should join us.

1034
00:57:14,022 --> 00:57:15,214
On the road.

1035
00:57:15,214 --> 00:57:17,194
Can't get deported if you're moving.

1036
00:57:17,194 --> 00:57:19,476
- Oliver, are you from under the Earth?

1037
00:57:20,509 --> 00:57:22,594
- No, I'm from London.

1038
00:57:22,594 --> 00:57:25,516
- Okay, and you're going to
the festival to reconcile.

1039
00:57:25,516 --> 00:57:27,327
Bray, what about you?

1040
00:57:27,327 --> 00:57:29,395
- I'm supposed to meet a guy.

1041
00:57:29,395 --> 00:57:30,756
- Mm, I see you.

1042
00:57:30,756 --> 00:57:32,867
You both are going for
the love, that's cool.

1043
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:33,983
I like that.

1044
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:37,862
- Oliver, it's super easy to
get over a girl, all right?

1045
00:57:37,862 --> 00:57:40,776
All you gotta do is say, whip it!

1046
00:57:40,776 --> 00:57:41,851
(can hissing)

1047
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:53,724
- I love that you don't do drugs, Oliver.

1048
00:57:53,724 --> 00:57:56,155
We need more people like that.

1049
00:57:56,155 --> 00:57:58,633
It's bad for your body.

1050
00:57:58,633 --> 00:58:00,758
(can hissing)

1051
00:58:09,222 --> 00:58:10,105
- [Bray] Do you want us to help pitch?

1052
00:58:10,105 --> 00:58:11,021
I've got some money.

1053
00:58:11,021 --> 00:58:12,904
- No, Bray, don't even
worry about it, bro.

1054
00:58:12,904 --> 00:58:14,552
I got this.

1055
00:58:14,552 --> 00:58:16,654
- You know, I really love this van.

1056
00:58:16,654 --> 00:58:19,978
I could actually see
myself in one someday.

1057
00:58:19,978 --> 00:58:21,611
- Bray, you was just in one.

1058
00:58:26,539 --> 00:58:29,325
You know Bray, I'm a little
whipped up right now.

1059
00:58:29,325 --> 00:58:33,942
But you seem nervous, I'm
sensing something from you.

1060
00:58:35,832 --> 00:58:38,832
- I just don't think
I'm what he's expecting.

1061
00:58:38,832 --> 00:58:40,091
- Oh, the guy.

1062
00:58:41,378 --> 00:58:43,376
Just be yourself, Bray.

1063
00:58:43,376 --> 00:58:44,567
Love is love.

1064
00:58:48,033 --> 00:58:50,800
Man, you know, I was gay once.

1065
00:58:51,817 --> 00:58:54,325
And I was seeing this guy.

1066
00:58:54,325 --> 00:58:58,402
And I was acting and pretending to be

1067
00:58:58,402 --> 00:59:01,727
what I thought he wanted me to be.

1068
00:59:03,229 --> 00:59:06,802
But uh, it turns out,

1069
00:59:06,802 --> 00:59:08,444
he just wanted the real me,

1070
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:10,121
the person he met initially.

1071
00:59:11,346 --> 00:59:15,941
And then things ended quickly.

1072
00:59:15,941 --> 00:59:20,141
And now, whenever I see
anyone relationshiply,

1073
00:59:21,404 --> 00:59:23,821
I just be myself.

1074
00:59:25,093 --> 00:59:27,087
I be me, Bray.

1075
00:59:27,087 --> 00:59:31,987
Because people want to be
with you, the real you,

1076
00:59:31,987 --> 00:59:33,366
you know?

1077
00:59:33,366 --> 00:59:34,199
- Yeah.

1078
00:59:35,608 --> 00:59:36,859
- Yeah.

1079
00:59:36,859 --> 00:59:39,476
Bray you just gotta live
the best life you can be.

1080
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:44,459
If you can't love yourself,

1081
00:59:44,459 --> 00:59:46,113
how can you love somebody else?

01:00:14,546 --> 01:00:15,604
Get out of my van.

1092
01:00:24,504 --> 01:00:26,444
- Stacey has the tickets, doesn't she?

1093
01:00:28,019 --> 01:00:29,069
- Yup.

1094
01:00:32,828 --> 01:00:33,911
- Perfect.

1095
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,823
So, we jump the fence, we find Stacey

1096
01:00:40,823 --> 01:00:42,290
before Shawn does.

1097
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:45,492
And you know what, you can
just do whatever you want.

1098
01:00:45,492 --> 01:00:46,859
- [Bray] Sounds good.

1099
01:00:49,629 --> 01:00:53,972
- [Oliver] So I have to ask,
why a Christian dating website?

1100
01:00:53,972 --> 01:00:56,342
- [Bray] I don't know man,
it started as a joke at first

1101
01:00:56,342 --> 01:00:58,842
and then Shawn messaged me.

1102
01:00:59,987 --> 01:01:00,820
- Right.

1103
01:01:02,349 --> 01:01:03,989
- He's different, you know?

1104
01:01:03,989 --> 01:01:05,189
He likes me for who I am.

1105
01:01:06,988 --> 01:01:08,380
- Except the part where he thinks

1106
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:09,697
you have a vagina.

1107
01:01:18,369 --> 01:01:20,677
I guess this is as good as it's gonna get.

1108
01:01:28,972 --> 01:01:30,047
All right.

1109
01:01:33,291 --> 01:01:37,405
Okay, so she was at the main
stage about an hour ago.

1110
01:01:37,405 --> 01:01:38,938
- [Bray] This place is weird.

1111
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,336
- Oh wait!

1112
01:01:43,336 --> 01:01:44,549
She's at the,

1113
01:01:44,549 --> 01:01:46,398
what does that say?

1114
01:01:46,398 --> 01:01:47,306
Boogaloo.

1115
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:51,987
What the fuck's a boogaloo?

1116
01:02:00,066 --> 01:02:00,930
- Hey.

1117
01:02:01,905 --> 01:02:03,192
- Hi.

1118
01:02:03,192 --> 01:02:06,051
- Wow, you're even more
beautiful in person.

1119
01:02:15,011 --> 01:02:17,594
(somber music)

1120
01:02:34,946 --> 01:02:36,329
- Very forward.

1121
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:41,165
- I was getting nervous that
you weren't gonna make it.

1122
01:02:42,765 --> 01:02:43,598
- What?

1123
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:45,923
- [Bray] Oliver!

1124
01:02:45,923 --> 01:02:46,963
- Fuck off.

1125
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:48,192
- We could fix this.

1126
01:02:48,192 --> 01:02:49,508
- Fix it?

1127
01:02:49,508 --> 01:02:50,933
There's nothing left to fix.

1128
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,926
You fucked this whole thing up.

1129
01:02:52,926 --> 01:02:53,863
- What?

1130
01:02:53,863 --> 01:02:54,765
- She wouldn't have run away

1131
01:02:54,765 --> 01:02:56,464
if you hadn't fucking told her!

1132
01:02:56,464 --> 01:02:57,465
- That is not fair.

1133
01:02:57,465 --> 01:02:58,858
You weren't even gonna tell her.

1134
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:01,652
You gotta stop just
ignoring all your problems.

1135
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:04,652
- Righteous advice, coming
from you, don't you think?

1136
01:03:07,098 --> 01:03:08,781
You're a piece of shit, Bray.

1137
01:03:37,042 --> 01:03:37,875
- Bray.

1138
01:03:40,171 --> 01:03:41,326
It's Bray, right?

1139
01:03:41,326 --> 01:03:42,443
- Uh, yeah.

1140
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:45,001
- Shawn from Denver.

1141
01:03:45,001 --> 01:03:46,955
- Yeah, from the phone.

1142
01:03:46,955 --> 01:03:48,013
- Yeah.

1143
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:55,332
I have had the strangest day.

1144
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:56,633
- Yeah?

1145
01:03:56,633 --> 01:03:57,466
- Yeah.

1146
01:03:58,398 --> 01:04:01,564
Did she ever like, mention me, Victoria?

1147
01:04:02,979 --> 01:04:05,792
- Yeah, she said she
really wanted to meet you.

1148
01:04:05,792 --> 01:04:07,257
- Really?

1149
01:04:07,257 --> 01:04:09,409
That's weird because she acted like

1150
01:04:09,409 --> 01:04:11,517
she didn't even know who I was.

1151
01:04:15,252 --> 01:04:16,321
- I know what you mean.

1152
01:04:16,321 --> 01:04:18,413
Some people just seem different over text.

1153
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:23,342
- Yeah I guess so, but it's like

1154
01:04:23,342 --> 01:04:25,050
we talked for so long.

1155
01:04:27,477 --> 01:04:28,727
- Yeah, I know.

1156
01:04:32,355 --> 01:04:33,997
- Before, there was something

1157
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,819
so real about her.

1158
01:04:37,819 --> 01:04:39,243
Like I was talking with somebody

1159
01:04:39,243 --> 01:04:41,477
who really understood who I was.

1160
01:04:42,352 --> 01:04:45,286
And I've never really had that before.

1161
01:04:47,794 --> 01:04:49,292
- Sometimes you just gotta
be real with yourself

1162
01:04:49,292 --> 01:04:51,423
before you can be real with other people.

1163
01:04:53,024 --> 01:04:55,903
But you can't project that
onto others, you know.

1164
01:04:55,903 --> 01:04:59,328
You just gotta know who
and what you are deep down.

1165
01:05:01,005 --> 01:05:02,760
- It's weird, I feel I can't be myself

1166
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,643
around anybody back home.

1167
01:05:05,972 --> 01:05:10,172
Like I really don't like any
of the girls in my hometown.

1168
01:05:11,122 --> 01:05:11,955
- Really?

1169
01:05:11,955 --> 01:05:12,788
- Yeah.

1170
01:05:14,687 --> 01:05:18,437
I guess I'm doomed. (chuckling)

1171
01:05:21,496 --> 01:05:22,329
- Shawn.

1172
01:05:23,741 --> 01:05:25,666
I need to tell you something.

1173
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:37,026
- Oh, it's Victoria.

1174
01:05:54,522 --> 01:05:56,522
- [Oliver] Fucking hell.

1175
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,562
- God, I'm an idiot!

1176
01:06:21,562 --> 01:06:22,684
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

1177
01:06:22,684 --> 01:06:24,021
- [Christian] You're an asshole.

1178
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:25,047
- I can explain.

1179
01:06:26,205 --> 01:06:27,713
- What were you expecting?

1180
01:06:27,713 --> 01:06:30,014
- I thought it wouldn't
matter if I was a guy.

1181
01:06:31,364 --> 01:06:32,198
(bashing)

1182
01:06:33,106 --> 01:06:34,102
- Be real with yourself

1183
01:06:34,102 --> 01:06:36,138
before you're real with other people.

1184
01:06:36,138 --> 01:06:38,980
What kind of advice is
that to give someone?

1185
01:06:51,284 --> 01:06:52,964
- Damn, Bray.

1186
01:06:52,964 --> 01:06:55,031
You got knocked the fuck out.

1187
01:06:59,386 --> 01:07:00,994
I'm guessing Shawn took it well.

1188
01:07:00,994 --> 01:07:02,439
- [Bray] Yup.

1189
01:07:02,439 --> 01:07:04,047
- Did you tell him that?

1190
01:07:04,047 --> 01:07:05,166
- [Bray] Yup.

1191
01:07:06,215 --> 01:07:07,307
- Oh, yikes.

1192
01:07:17,434 --> 01:07:21,131
You know what, this guy
actually seems pretty cool.

1193
01:07:21,131 --> 01:07:22,907
Maybe you did have something.

1194
01:07:26,137 --> 01:07:28,749
I mean it doesn't change
the fact that you lied.

1195
01:07:30,541 --> 01:07:32,274
- I was trying to be myself.

1196
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:37,991
- You know, you can be
a real moppet sometimes.

1197
01:07:39,982 --> 01:07:42,547
- Yeah, I guess I thought
that wouldn't matter.

1198
01:07:42,547 --> 01:07:45,806
- It might matter to some
people though, you know?

1199
01:07:48,008 --> 01:07:49,333
I'm sorry.

1200
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:50,863
You'll find someone.

1201
01:07:50,863 --> 01:07:52,664
You could come to England.

1202
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:57,743
There are plenty of you
motherfuckers out there

1203
01:07:57,743 --> 01:07:58,985
prancing about.

1204
01:08:02,147 --> 01:08:03,314
- Yeah, maybe.

1205
01:08:07,643 --> 01:08:08,538
- Well what do you wanna do?

1206
01:08:08,538 --> 01:08:11,327
We could stick around and
catch some more of the bands.

1207
01:08:12,685 --> 01:08:14,642
- No, I think I'm ready to go home.

1208
01:08:14,642 --> 01:08:16,083
- What?

1209
01:08:16,083 --> 01:08:18,032
Why, we just got here.

1210
01:08:20,877 --> 01:08:22,727
I don't even know how
we're gonna get home.

1211
01:08:26,409 --> 01:08:28,017
- What are you gonna do about Stacey?

1212
01:08:31,298 --> 01:08:33,648
- It's pretty clear I'm
not the best for her.

1213
01:08:37,795 --> 01:08:41,445
(ducks quacking)

1214
01:08:41,445 --> 01:08:43,853
You know male ducks don't quack?

1215
01:08:44,945 --> 01:08:46,125
Pretty gnarly.

1216
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:48,913
- [Announcer] Finally
returning to the stage,

1217
01:08:48,913 --> 01:08:51,968
motherfucking Count Jermaine

1218
01:08:51,968 --> 01:08:55,528
and the Carpet Cleaners!

1219
01:08:55,528 --> 01:08:58,303
- This song goes out to
my boys Oliver and Bray.

1220
01:08:58,303 --> 01:08:59,995
I love you and I hope you find the love

1221
01:08:59,995 --> 01:09:01,587
that you've been searching for.

1222
01:09:01,587 --> 01:09:02,643

01:19:41,147 --> 01:19:42,314
- Really, why?

1444
01:19:43,388 --> 01:19:45,439
- I fucked a traffic cone.

1445
01:19:45,439 --> 01:19:47,476
So it was either that
or six months of rehab.

1446
01:19:47,476 --> 01:19:48,931
- Wait, so are you even allowed to go?

1447
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,385
- To the festival?

1448
01:19:51,385 --> 01:19:52,683
Yeah dude, I don't care.

1449
01:19:52,683 --> 01:19:53,728
This is gonna be the best festival

1450
01:19:53,728 --> 01:19:54,970
in the whole of Europe.

1451
01:19:57,327 --> 01:19:59,194
We're gonna get so fucked.
