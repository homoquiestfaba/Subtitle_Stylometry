1
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,600
Oh, shut up, June,

2
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,680
you stupid
whining, bitch!

3
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,080
Enid Pearly,

4
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,280
I really do not know where
you learned such language.

5
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,040
Shame on you.

6
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,880
You know the Lord
doesn't like it

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,960
when little girls
talk like that.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,840
Come to Momma.

9
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,200
Shh.

10
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,960
And I'm sure that Harry's
mother would not allow it.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,520
Now would she,
Harry?

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,280
No, ma'am,
she wouldn't.

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,520
She wouldn't.

14
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,680
Damn right.

15
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,080
No, ma'am,
she wouldn't.

16
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
Move it.

17
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,920
Oh, Lord, there
is no rest for the weary.

18
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,360
Shit.

19
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,520
Harry, that will
be your mother.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,960
Enid, be a dear and watch
your sister for a sec.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh, my God.

22
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,240
There, there, June baby.

23
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,200
What's the matter?

24
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,160
Are you cold?

25
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,840
Is that it?

26
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,480
Is my little sister
Junie-wunie cold?

27
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,000
Enid, what are you doing?

28
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,120
None of your business,
butt face.

29
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,480
You're gonna
get it, Enid.

30
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,320
You really are.

31
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,600
Uh-oh.

32
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,360
Hurry up, Harry.

33
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,080
Come on back to
the kitchen, Mrs. Hopper.

34
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,600
Say hello
to Mrs. Hopper, Enid.

35
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,280
Hi, Mrs. Hopper.

36
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,120

Tell me something, June.
have you been able

75
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,840
to get anything out of
Mr. Peewee over here?

76
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,600
Enid.

77
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,040
Ahh!

78
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,240
Now I want you
to fess up

79
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,760

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,800
Now just cool it, okay?

83
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,960
We just have to--

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,720
we're
all adults, right?

85
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,240
Well, we just
have to... be adult.

86
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,400
God, are you just
completely brain dead?

87
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,120
Adult?

88
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,000
You want me
to be an adult?

89
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,720
I think you're right.

90
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,360
I think I should
be an adult, I do.

91
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,080
At your funeral.

92
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,960
Oh, God.

93
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,280
- Give me the gun.
- Dick head.

94
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,760
Wait.

95
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,360
Get up.

96
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,160
You dickless wonder!

97
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,680
I killed her.

98
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,400
Don't be stupid.
She's not dead.

99
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,800
- My own sister.
- She's just unconscious.

100
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,360
- My own flesh and blood.
- Enid?

101
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,880
Dead.

102
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,120
Enid.

103
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,400
Enid.

104
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,480
She's dead.

105
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,720
Are you sure?

106
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,720
I'm sure.

107
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,640
Oh, my God.

108
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,920
Don't you think you better
go get the door, Harry?

109
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,280
Oh, shit.

110
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,760
This is a .357 Magnum,

111
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,680
the most powerful
handgun in the world.

112
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,960
You make one move,
asshole, you're history.

113
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,760
Floyd, so help me,
one of these days.

114
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,240
Where did you
get that thing?

115
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,320
I just got it
in the mail.

116
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,960
She's a beauty,
isn't she?

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,680
Um, did I hear
a gunshot just now?

118
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,520
- Gunshot?
- Yeah.

119
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,040
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

120
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,480
Oh, me and Enid,
we're having a little fight.

121
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,440
And you shot her?

122
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,280
- Good thinking.
- Don't be ridiculous.

123
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,760
No.

124
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,000
My gun
fell off the table,

125
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,920
and there is one in
the chamber, you know.

126
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,560
Um, we got to go now?

127
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,640
Yeah, well,
I gotta stop

128
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,080
and get some ammo
for this monster.

129
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,640
Look,
I'll get Enid to drive me.

130
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,120
I'll see you
later, Floyd.

131
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,360
Are you okay?

132
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,360
Yeah, sure, I'm fine.

133
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,680
- I'll see you in a while.
- Are you sure?

134
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,120
I'm okay, really.
I'll see you later.

135
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,040
What are we gonna do?

136
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,560
What are we gonna do?

137
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,680
Come on, Harry,
you're a cop.

138
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,200
You're supposed to know
about these things.

139
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,560
Oh, God.
Oh, mother of Jesus.

140
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,280
Oh, God.

141
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,920
I'm going down for this.

142
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,200
I know it.

143
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,800
I can feel it
in my bones.

144
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,000
- What?
- Nothing.

145
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,000
Come on, Harry,
this is serious.

146
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,600
I can
feel it in my bones.

147
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,840
- I said this is serious.
- I'm going down.

148
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,320
No shit.

149
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,080
No shit.
It's all your fault.

150
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,640
My fault?
My fault?

151
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
You are the one that
cracked her over the head.

152
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,280
Why did you have
to hit her so hard, June?

153
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,920
God!

154
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,400
You're the one that came
on to me in the first place.

155
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,240
What?

156
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,000
You came on
to me

157
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,480
over that Christmas party
down at Ronnie's Pizza.

158
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,080
It was 2 years ago.

159
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,320
Yeah, well, if you hadn't
started hitting on me,

160
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,120
we wouldn't be in this mess,
now, would we?

161
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,840
Am I really
hearing this?

162
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,920
Well, you did come on
to me first, didn't you?

163
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,880
Admit it.

164
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,760
Okay, I admit it.

165
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,480
It's my fault, all right?
So what?

166
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,320
Does that change anything?
You feel better now?

167
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,560
I'm sorry, honey.

168
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,880
Really.

169
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm sorry, okay?

170
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,960
I gave her that clown
for her birthday last year.

171
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,720
She hated it.

172
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,600
What do you mean?
She said she loved it.

173
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,560
She lied.

174
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,320
Really?

175
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,680
Yeah.

176
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,760
It's been hell, June,
I swear.

177
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,120
Your sister was driving me
to an early grave.

178
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,240
Oh, please stop
bawling, honey.

179
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,280
I can't help it.

180
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,000
I mean, I just
killed my sister.

181
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,320
I got a right, don't I?

182
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
I mean, even if
she was a bitch,

183
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,080
I got a right, don't I?

184
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,600
Yes, you do, sweetheart.
You have every right.

185
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,240
What are we gonna do?

186
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,040
Well, you know...

187
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,840
I mean...

188
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,920
We could own up,

189
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,520
take the rap,
plead self-defense.

190
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
The problem there is,

191
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
folks ain't gonna take to
a woman killing her own sister

192
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,840
'cause she found out
she's screwing her husband.

193
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,120
I guess
I'd be an accomplice

194
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,040
'cause I was the one
doing the screwing.

195
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,040
Life in prison, is that
what you're trying to say?

196
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,880
Like life.

197
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,000
Well, no,
just hang on.

198
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,800
We could get off
for good behavior after...

199
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,800
I don't know,
20 years?

200
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,040
Great.

201
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,960
Or--

202
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,720
I know this is gonna
sound illegal.

203
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,200
Maybe we could make it
look sorta like an accident.

204
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,160
I can't believe
she hated this clown.

205
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,320
A car accident.

206
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,200
Cost me a fortune.

207
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,640
If we could just get her out
to the car with no one seeing.

208
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,560
I was gonna
buy it for myself.

209
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,560
What do you think?

210
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,600
About what?

211
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,320
Making it look like
an accident, June.

212
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,000
A car accident.

213
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,640
Look, if we play
our cards right,

214
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,240
we got to be real
careful, baby,

215
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,400
I think
we can pull it off.

216
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,240
Wait a few months,

217
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,600
stay away from each other
till things calm down.

218
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,680
We could be together.

219
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,080
Just like we always
talked about.

220
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,000
Huh?

221
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,000
Not now, Harry.

222
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,880
Well, June, what do you
think about what I just said,

223
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,680
about disposing of
the body?

224
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,160
No, no, Harry.

225
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,960
It sounds so terrible.

226
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,400
I mean, I never thought
of Enid as a body before.

227
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,960
Honey, she's never
been dead before.

228
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,160
Yeah, not like that.

229
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,440
Seems like we don't have
much of a choice, sweetheart.

230
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,640
Why did you have
to be such a bitch, Enid,

231
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,040
always giving me
a hard time,

232
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,800
giving everybody
a hard time?

233
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,800
We don't really have
a choice, do we?

234
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,920
Well, this is
a dumb idea, Harry.

235
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,200
I feel so stupid.

236
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,920
No, no, it's good.

237
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,080
You and Enid sort of
look the same.

238
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,280
Oh, thanks.

239
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,520
From a distance, honey,
I meant from a distance.

240
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,480
Anybody sees us, they'll
just think you're Enid.

241
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,280
Head up 301 to
the mountains.

242
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,520
There's a road
that goes to El Rado.

243
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,120
- Do you know it?
- Yeah.

244
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,520
Go about 200 yards
past that road,

245
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,760
there's a real sharp curve,
you pull over,

246
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,680
you put Enid
into the driver's seat.

247
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,920
Are you listening to me?

248
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,160
- Yes.
- Pour some whisky on her,

249
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,720
you know, make her
look like she was drunk.

250
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,080
And then, well,
just let her go.

251
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,600
She's got a bump
on her head, right?

252
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,400
No one will ever know.

253
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,720
It's gonna work, honey.
It's gonna work perfect.

254
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,200
Do you really like
this lipstick color?

255
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,560
I don't.

256
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,840
Listen, honey, as soon
as you dump the car,

257
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,440
mess yourself up a little, you
know, roll around in the dirt.

258
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,320
Why the hell would
I want to do that?

259
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,400
Well, get the dust out
of the attic, honey.

260
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,680
You're gonna have to say
you jumped out of the car

261
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,680
just before
it went over.

262
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,640
Watch out!

263
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,600
- Jesus.
- No need to yell at me.

264
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,120
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm sorry.

265
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,400
I'm just a little
nervous, all right?

266
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,680
Never had a murder
on my hands--

267
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,560
God, don't say
murder, Harry.

268
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,480
It sounds so...

269
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,480
Well, Harry.

270
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,720
Yeah.

271
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,640
If I push the car
over the cliff,

272
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,360
how am I supposed
to get back home?

273
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,960
You're gonna have
to hitchhike.

274
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Hitchhike?

275
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,040
Pull over there.

276
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,880
Oh, shit,
there's Floyd.

277
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,400
Okay, you understand?

278
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,880
You got
everything clear?

279
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,040
- Oh, Enid.
- Bye.

280
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,600
Oh, God.

281
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,360
Oh, she's in a hurry.
What's up?

282
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,920
Oh, she's going to Santa Fe
to see her parents, Floyd.

283
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,800
She's real late.

284
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,200
She looks different.

285
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,520
She's taking better
care of herself, right?

286
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,800
You got that right.

287
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,240
I finally put
my foot down.

288
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,080
Oh, God, I know
that I sinned.

289
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:02,000
I know that you're punishing
me for what me and Harry done.

290
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,600
Shit, God,
give me a break.

291
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,080
Please, please,
just give me a break.

292
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,000
How the hell's Jasper?

293
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,080
Yeah.
Just told me he had to have

294
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,120
his leg cut off,
amputated.

295
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,480
Honey, you just
listen to Mavis now.

296
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,080
I'd put him out of his misery.
I really would.

297
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,440
They get real nasty

298
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,160
when they get
a handicap like that.

299
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,280
I'd just put him
right out of his misery.

300
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,160
You're such a card.

301
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,640
Oh.

302
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,880
Police station.

303
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,880
Hi, Mavis.

304
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,960
This is, uh...

305
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,120
Doreen Waverly.
Is Harry there?

306
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,600
Harry?
Hey, go tell Sherlock

307
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,880
his Aunt Doreen's
on the phone.

308
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,720
He's in the can.

309
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,880
- We playing bingo Friday?
- Well, I don't know,

310
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,360
but I will certainly
let you know, okay?

311
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,840
Charlene's gonna be there.

312
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,720
No one's seen
her new thighs yet.

313
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,840
It's your Aunt Doreen.

314
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,360
He's coming.
Hold on.

315
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,280
Doreen, how are you?

316
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,200
Harry, she's stuck
in the door.

317
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,040
Uh, w-w-what's that
you say, Doreen?

318
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,240
Enid is stuck
in the goddamn door,

319
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,760
so you're gonna have
to come back over here

320
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,520
and help me get her
into the goddamn car.

321
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,800
How in the hell, June...

322
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,720
Well, you don't say.

323
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,840
Uh, well, I don't know
if I can do that, Doreen.

324
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,720
You see, me and Floyd here,
he's right here, see,

325
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,880
and we have to go
out on a call.

326
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,400
Harry Lee Hopper,

327
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,000
if you do not get your ass
back here right now,

328
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,320
so help me,
I'll shove your plan

329
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,720
where the sun don't shine.
You hear me?

330
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,800
Sure do, Auntie, I sure do.

331
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,800
I'll see what I can...

332
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,400
...can do, Doreen.
I'll see you soon.

333
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,920
Problem, Harry?

334
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,240
No, no, no problem.

335
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,840
Just got to swing by the house
and pick something up.

336
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,880
My Aunt Doreen.

337
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,480
I'll be right back.

338
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,440
Oh, my God, look at this.

339
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,320
Come on, I only got
a couple of minutes.

340
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,760
Floyd's waiting in the car.

341
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,360
Why can't you come by
and pick me up?

342
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,800
What?

343
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,480
Well, I'm gonna be
standing out there

344
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,440
in the middle of nowhere
with my thumb stuck out,

345
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,560
covered in dirt.

346
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,720
What if I know the person
who picks me up?

347
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,360
I just don't see why I have
to do all the disposing.

348
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,960
Honey, if I don't get back
to that car in 2 minutes,

349
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,520
you are not gonna have to
worry about the way

350
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,960
you look for the next 20 years.

351
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,080
You'll pick me up then?

352
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,520
Yes. Yes, yes, come on.

353
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,040
- Harry.
- What?

354
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
Do you love me?

355
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,920
Yes.
Yes, June, I do.

356
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,400
Then say it.
Say that you love me.

357
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,720
I love you, June.
I do.

358
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,080
I love you with all my heart.
Goddamn, I love you.

359
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,200
Now come on, honey,
for Christ sakes.

360
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,440
Oh, God.

361
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,760
God.

362
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,640
All right, get her
strapped in.

363
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,720
Make sure she's sitting
upright. I gotta go.

364
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,920
But, Harry...

365
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,480
Ah!

366
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,840
- Floyd.
- Harry.

367
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,520
Come on, let's go.

368
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,560
Uh, you're dripping
with sweat, Harry.

369
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,000
I'll be damned.

370
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,240
I must be coming down
with a cold or something.

371
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,400
Let's stop by the store
and get some aspirin.

372
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,800
Come on, let's go.

373
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,080
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

374
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,440
No, everything is fine,
partner.

375
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,160
Come on,
let's get out of here.

376
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,960
You sure?

377
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,840
Okay, Floyd,
there is something.

378
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,880
I'll tell you in the car.

379
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,360
Babs called.

380
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,160
Charlene wants you to
come in early on Monday

381
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,280
because Mrs. Chambers
needs a perm for the wedding.

382
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,960
Okay?

383
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,960
You know, maybe
I wouldn't get 20 years.

384
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,480
I mean, maybe the judge
would have pity on me.

385
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,520
Wait a minute.

386
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,880
I could plead insanity.

387
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,560
No, they'll not believe me.

388
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,040
Oh.

389
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,200
You were even ugly
as a child.

390
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,880
You know, you always laughed 
when you hurt me.

391
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:08,400
You hurt me 
all the time, all the time.

392
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,720
You hated me from the moment 
I was born.

393
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,640
All right, why don't you
tell your Uncle Floydie here

394
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,080
what's going on.

395
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,160
Well, it's like this, see...

396
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,120
Me and Enid--

397
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,240
Well, me and Enid
haven't been

398
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,800
getting on
too well lately, Floyd.

399
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,080
You know, Floyd,
she may be having an affair.

400
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,000
- What?
- Yeah.

401
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,880
She says she's going up to
Santa Fe to see her folks,

402
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,840
and I don't know.

403
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,520
I think she's going up
to see her lover.

404
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,720
Enid has a lover?

405
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,280
Oh, Harry, you got
to be kidding.

406
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,640
I mean, who in their
right mind would ever--

407
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,920
You're all tied in now.

408
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,200
There you go.

409
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,280
You know, I cannot
remember the last time

410
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,040
we went for
a little drive together.

411
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,680
Can you?

412
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,080
Here we go.

413
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,480
Oh, geez.
Oh.

414
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,120
Get off of me.

415
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,240
God, the Lopez'
trailer.

416
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,720
A big-city cop would
probably shoot himself

417
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,320
if he had to wash
his own patrol car.

418
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,280
I can't help it, Harry.

419
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,600
- I just envy those guys.
- I know you do, buddy.

420
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,800
They haven't got time for this
in New York or Chicago.

421
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,960
They're too busy
fighting crime, real crime.

422
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,880
Armed robbery,
murder, gang warfare,

423
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,280
your dope-crazed terrorists,
they got it all.

424
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,000
I don't know, Floyd,
you could say hello

425
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,480
to a bullet
any day of the week.

426
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,960
God, you really like
scarin' me, don't you?

427
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,440
You remember that Halloween

428
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,320
when you put that
pig's head in my lap?

429
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,800
Blood everywhere all over
my pretty white costume,

430
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,360
and you couldn't
stop laughing.

431
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,880
Oh, now we're out of gas.

432
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,560
I suppose you think
that's funny, too, huh?

433
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,480
What have we got?

434
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,960
We got Sam pluggin' rabbits
in the middle of Main Street

435
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,440
during
the lunch rush.

436
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,840
It's not enough
to keep us sharp.

437
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,200
I need crime,
Harry, real soon.

438
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,160
You know what I mean?

439
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,480
Floyd, I know
what you mean.

440
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,080
Shit.

441
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,920
Oh, my God.

442
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,680
Ah!

443
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,920
Is this what
you're looking for?

444
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,800
Wasn't locked.

445
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,560
So the guy just stands there
with a daiquiri in one hand,

446
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,720
and a gun like a cannon
with eight barrels in the other.

447
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,400
He puts the daiquiri
down on the tray.

448
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,480
He smiles, and then,
boom, boom, boom, boom,

449
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,640
he mows them down,
40 people chopped in half...

450
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,160
You filled it
with unleaded gas.

451
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,400
This car takes leaded.

452
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,880
It will ruin the engine.

453
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,520
That will be 20 bucks.

454
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,880
Why didn't you
tell me that before?

455
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,520
You didn't ask.

456
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,800
Oh, that's great.

457
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,720
Thanks a lot.

458
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,080
Hey, 20 bucks.

459
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,440
My money
is in my purse.

460
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,960
Glad to hear it.

461
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,800
Yeah, well, I've locked
the keys in the car.

462
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,200
What about
your friend here?

463
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,960
Why don't you just ask
her to open the door?

464
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,040
She's sleeping.

465
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,640
He's only got
one bullet left in his .45,

466
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,160
right smack
in the forehead.

467
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,360
Boom!

468
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,000
Right between the eyes,
one shot, real clean.

469
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,000
- That was it.
- Floyd.

470
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,040
Yeah.

471
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,520
I'll be right back.

472
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,120
I got to make
a phone call.

473
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,360
Enid.

474
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,440
Hey, come on,
hurry up.

475
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,440
She's been drinking.

476
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,680
I think she just passed out.

477
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,080
Lady,
I don't care.

478
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,600
Ah!

479
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,680
What's going on, June?

480
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,880
Harry, I've locked
the keys in the car.

481
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,040
Enid is...
well, you know.

482
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,400
No, I don't know.

483
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,080
Well, she's sleeping.

484
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,400
I mean, you know,
she's been drinking a lot,

485
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,240
and you know how she
is when she drinks.

486
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:25,960
You know this lady, Harry?

487
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,840
Yeah, sort of.

488
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,640
She owes me 20 bucks.

489
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:34,160
Hey, it looks like we're just
gonna have to wake her up.

490
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,720
Oh, thank God.

491
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,960
Hey, what's
the hold up?

492
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,600
- Oh!
- Shit.

493
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,920
Haven't been getting on
too well lately.

494
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,520
It's a family
thing, you know.

495
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,000
You okay, honey?

496
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,080
Come on, let's go.

497
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,360
Geez,
she's shit faced.

498
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,880
You got that right.

499
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,600
You know,
I do not know why

500
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,800
I got involved with him
in the first place.

501
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,360
Must've been crazy.

502
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,720
You know, those cops just
love telling people what to do.

503
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,400
June, do this.
June, do that.

504
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,920
I don't know,
Enid, really don't.

505
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,520
I mean, my life
has been a tragedy, Enid.

506
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,840
A tragedy.

507
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,920
What did I do to deserve
a sister like you?

508
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,840
From day one, nothing
but hell on earth.

509
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,560
A tragedy.

510
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,840
Dangerous curve.

511
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,960
Well, here we are.

512
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,320
It'll will be
over soon, Enid.

513
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,440
Oh, my God.

514
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,360
Shit.

515
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,760
Shit!

516
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,040
Shit. Shit.

517
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,160
Great idea,
Harry, real great.

518
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,280
Just drive her over the edge.
Now what?

519
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,920
Do you have any other
bright ideas?

520
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,040
Damn it.

521
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,280
That's it.

522
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,280
Thank you.

523
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,120
Now what am I
gonna do with you?

524
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,280
What are we gonna do?

525
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,680
I'll be right back.

526
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,400
Bottle of Jack Daniel's.

527
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,440
That will be $6.49.

528
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,680
Hey, how you doing?

529
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,760
You want to party there,
little lady?

530
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,600
You from around here?

531
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,160
Not very friendly, huh?

532
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,800
You got a pay phone?

533
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,920
Hey, put out the flags.
She talked.

534
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,040
There's a pay phone
outside by the cage.

535
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,680
Hey there, sweet cakes,
you want to party?

536
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,680
I got some beers,
you got some JD.

537
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,480
What do you say?

538
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,360
Mavis, hi, this
is Lucy Stark, cousin.

539
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,640
Lucy, is Harry there?

540
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,480
Well, could you--
could you radio him,

541
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,960
and get him
to call me at 555-2219?

542
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,840
Yeah, no,
it's a pay phone.

543
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,400
I'm gonna be 
waitin' here, okay?

544
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,840
Uh-huh.

545
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,040
Yes, yes, thank you.

546
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,840
How about it,
Cousin Lucy?

547
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,200
You and me
get down and party?

548
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,240
Name's George,
friends call me Jim.

549
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,480
Listen, George,
I am not in the mood.

550
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,560
All right?

551
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,640
So why don't you just get
in your truck and truck off?

552
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,040
You got an attitude
problem there, lesbo.

553
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,480
Maybe your friend
there wants some.

554
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,360
I doubt it.

555
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,640
Shit, you never know
till you ask, right?

556
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,520
No, believe me,
she is not in the mood.

557
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,920
- She is sleeping, okay?
- Hey, I got a mood right here.

558
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,640
- Hey, baby.
- Harry?

559
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,000
Oh, God,
Harry, it's me.

560
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,000
There was an accident
at that place.

561
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,200
What are you
talking about, honey?

562
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,960
There was an accident
there already.

563
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,360
I mean, there's cops,
there's a road block.

564
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,560
Now what am I
gonna do?

565
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,840
Oh, Jesus.

566
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,840
Uh, where
are you now?

567
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,040
I'm at Jake's liquor store
on the El Vayo Road.

568
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,120
Okay, listen.

569
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,480
There's another place further
up the mountains,

570
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,480
up at the lookout.

571
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,920
You can do it there.

572
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,960
Harry, I don't know.

573
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,560
I mean,
this whole thing

574
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,160
it's getting really
weird, all right?

575
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,680
I mean,
I am freaking out here,

576
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,120
and there is this guy
hitting on me,

577
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,680
and right now, he
is over with Enid.

578
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,520
Hey, I like your outfit,
swear to God, no kidding.

579
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,800
Hey!

580
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,400
I said that she
was not interested,

581
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,000
so just
leave her alone.

582
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,520
Come on, sweetheart, let's
play "strike the monkey."

583
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,120
June.

584
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,880
God.

585
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,120
What do you mean
he's over there with Enid?

586
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,240
Who is over there
with Enid?

587
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,720
George.
He's drunk.

588
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,720
Hey!
Whoo!

589
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,280
Come on, baby.

590
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,920
How would you like to sit on
my big eight and twirl, huh?

591
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,560
Listen, I've got to go.

592
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,040
I will call you
later, all right?

593
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,000
June.

594
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,680
- Hey!
- Wake up in there.

595
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,360
Hey, what's the matter?
You look sick.

596
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,560
Get off of the car.

597
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,000
Don't get off the car,
I don't care.

598
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,480
What is the matter
with you?

599
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,600
Whoa!

600
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,280
Please help me.

601
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,840
Get off my car,
you son of a bitch.

602
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,200
Whoo!
Whoo!

603
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,160
My rodeo.

604
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:05,360
My car! What did I ever do to
you, I don't even know you.

605
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,920
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

606
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,040
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.

607
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,920
Sit up, Enid, please.

608
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,760
I mean, we are in some really
deep shit now, Enid,

609
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,400
you know that?

610
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,920
Oh, God.
Great ride.

611
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,280
Look, Harry, there's something
I got to get off my chest.

612
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,240
Can I ask you a question?

613
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,320
Sure.

614
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,880
Now don't get this wrong.

615
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,280
I mean, just don't take it

616
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,720
the wrong way
or anything, all right?

617
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,680
You've been acting
pretty strange lately,

618
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,040
and I was wondering...

619
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,080
Are you on the take?

620
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,280
On the take?

621
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,400
Floyd, we're in Las Moscas,
New Mexico,

622
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,880
not the fucking Bronx!

623
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,040
- Jesus, Floyd, sometimes.
- All right. All right.

624
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,280
So I'm off base there.
I'm sorry, okay?

625
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,480
You have been
acting pretty weird.

626
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,640
I told you, Floyd, it's Enid.

627
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,560
She's two-timing me.

628
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,600
I find that really
hard to believe,

629
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,600
I got to be honest.

630
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,320
Number 2, number 2,

631
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,240
we got a disturbance 
at Jake's liquor store

632
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,600
on the El Vayo road.

633
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,360
Some woman's gone crazy 
with the car.

634
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,120
Require assistance. Over.

635
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,000
Oh, I'm glad
you're not on the take.

636
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,640
Okay, now, let's get
out there, right.

637
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,280
We're on our way, Mave.

638
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,680
Momma
used to bring you,

639
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,520
me and Harry up to this lookout
when we were kids.

640
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,040
You'd creep up behind me,

641
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,480
and pretend to push me
over the edge.

642
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,560
Been scared
of heights ever since.

643
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,240
I think it's kind of fitting

644
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,720
that this is gonna be your
final resting place, don't you?

645
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,920
So beautiful.

646
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,320
Isn't that romantic, Enid?

647
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,440
You remember those days?

648
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,640
Seems like 100 years.

649
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,400
You remember Bobby Ellis?

650
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,200
God, what a hunk he was.

651
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,600
Football team, senior prom.

652
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,840
He asked me to
marry him, you know?

653
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,200
Yeah, he did,
night of the prom.

654
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,720
I thought he asked me

655
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,240
'cause he just
wanted to get laid.

656
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,720
The thing was, that's all
I wanted to do.

657
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,680
So we did it.

658
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,920
Boys' locker room,
behind the gym.

659
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,920
It was wonderful.

660
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,400
Then Mr. Higgins, the math
teacher, walked in

661
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,640
just as he was
havin' his orgasm.

662
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,520
Bobby fell off the table
and broke his elbow.

663
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,080
He said that ruined
his pro-ball career.

664
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,320
Now he's selling insurance
over in Albuquerque.

665
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,400
Magic goes, don't it?

666
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,840
The sparkle.

667
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:38,200
I mean, everything just gets
so complicated, difficult.

668
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,680
Rotten.

669
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,600
Life just whizzes by.

670
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,040
Before you know it,
you're old.

671
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:56,320
Fed up, ready to meet
your Maker.

672
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:05,040
You know, I bet

673
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:09,480
if Bobby had not
fallen off that table...

674
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,440
that he would have become
a pro and married me.

675
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,640
But God said
let's see what would happen

676
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,640
if Mr. Higgins walked in.

677
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,000
How are they gonna
deal with that?

678
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,240
You know, she would never have
said it to my face,

679
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,800
but I knew that Mom
could not stand the way

680
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,800
that you were always
going on about Harry

681
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,360
not making enough money.

682
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,200
You made him feel worthless
sometimes, you know that?

683
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,560
He told me.

684
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:52,560
He said, "Enid makes me
feel worthless sometimes."

685
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,000
He did, he said that.

686
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,400
You know,
Susie over at the salon says

687
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:07,040
that you are having an affair
with Mr. Suarez.

688
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:11,960
God, I just cannot imagine you
with Mr. Suarez.

689
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,800
Of course, I can't
imagine you with anybody.

690
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,120
I mean, why would any man
ever want to have any--

691
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,400
Well, see, Officer,

692
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,080
me and Enid
pulled over for a little drink

693
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,360
to watch the sun go down.

694
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,880
Now I-- I got out,
and I went for a stroll,

695
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,160
you know, to get
some fresh air

696
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,040
as the sun was going down.

697
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:04,120
Now Enid must have
been trying

698
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,920
to pull the car
around or something.

699
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,440
Because,
before I knew it,

700
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,800
the car was rolling down
into the barrel pit.

701
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,800
I mean, there was nothing
that I could do, just nothing.

702
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,800
We better go find
this little lady.

703
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,840
- She sounds like a maniac.
- God, the guy was drunk.

704
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,080
- Look at him.
- Guys, I only want the beer.

705
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,800
She was probably just
protecting herself.

706
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,160
Come on, Harry,
let's check it out.

707
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,000
She's dangerous.
She could kill somebody.

708
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,000
Floyd, whoever she was,

709
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,480
she's just pissed off
at the guy.

710
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,920
Why did you do this to me?

711
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:46,080
Do you know that 75%
of all Mafia hit men are women?

712
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,760
- What?
- No shit, it's a fact.

713
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,720
- So?
- So you never know.

714
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,120
Let's go.

715
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,200
Floyd.

716
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,080
Floyd.

717
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,080
Come on, let's go.

718
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,720
She's gone.

719
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,560
You look like shit, Enid.

720
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,480
I can't take you into town
looking like that.

721
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,000
I'm really sorry
about this, honey,

722
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,400
but I think
that you're just gonna

723
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,800
have to rot in the trunk.

724
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,360
Sorry, Lord, I really am.

725
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,880
I swear I didn't mean
to hit her so hard.

726
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,440
I mean, she was gonna
shoot Harry.

727
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,760
If she did, there'd be nobody
around to take care of me.

728
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,560
We were going to tell you

729
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,280
just as soon as you
got back from Santa Fe.

730
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,240
I swear to God, we were.

731
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,160
We were gonna get married
right after the divorce.

732
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,880
I know
that it was wrong

733
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,920
for me and Harry to be doing
what we did,

734
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,480
but these things happen,
don't they?

735
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,840
God.

736
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,240
I mean, you read about it
all the time, don't you?

737
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,680
I do, all the time.

738
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:07,360
Well, you see, Officer,
me and Enid,

739
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,160
we were staying here
at this motel,

740
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,040
and, I mean, I was sleeping.

741
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:17,400
And when I woke up,
she was gone.

742
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,400
I mean, she must
have just wandered out

743
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,120
into the desert
or something for sort of,

744
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,000
I don't know, what, a stroll?

745
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,160
And I don't know. Why?

746
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,360
What do you mean,
she's dead?

747
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,320
That's impossible.

748
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,680
Oh, my God,
how did it happen?

749
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,040
Shit.

750
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,960
Look, I know--

751
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,560
I know it's gonna
be lonely out here

752
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,960
and everything,
and I'm sorry.

753
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,160
I really am, I swear.

754
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,840
Just think that this is--
this is for the best, okay?

755
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,360
Bye, Enid.

756
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,320
Shit.

757
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,600
Oh, please.

758
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,560
Come on,
you son of a bitch.

759
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,680
Oh, God.

760
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,920
What the hell do you
think you are doing?

761
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,520
Well, I--
I came off the road

762
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:33,520
to relieve myself,
if you must know.

763
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,760
All right.

764
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,720
This is an old Indian
burial ground, you know.

765
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,640
- It's sacred.
- Really?

766
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,400
I'm sorry,
I didn't know.

767
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,160
Yeah, well, Indians
don't appreciate people

768
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,640
who defecate on
their burial grounds.

769
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,400
What do you think
this is, a public john?

770
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,040
Look, I said I was
sorry, didn't I?

771
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,840
Ugh.

772
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,320
Excuse me.

773
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,800
I seem to be stuck
in the sand here.

774
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,040
Do you think
that you could

775
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,880
give me a tow
back to the road?

776
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,800
Please.

777
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,200
There was a storm,
and I slipped in the mud.

778
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,120
All right, come on.

779
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,760
Boom! Head explodes
like a cantaloupe.

780
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,320
Then the wife walks in.

781
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,600
The guy turns around
and opens up on her.

782
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,360
Psshh.

783
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,000
Covers her
from head to toe.

784
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,000
She flies out the window,
lands on a passing car,

785
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,320
goes right through
the windshield,

786
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,080
the car hits
a fire hydrant,

787
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,880
and then right into
the clothing store window.

788
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:57,760
Dummies flying everywhere.

789
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,280
Man, it was just crazy.

790
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,720
Number 2? Number 2?

791
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,280
Hello, are you there?

792
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,440
Yeah, Mave, it's Floyd.
What's up?

793
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,200
It's Enid for Harry.

794
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,640
Wants him to call her back
at 555-8870.

795
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,520
It's a pay phone.

796
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,520
Enid?

797
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,000
Hi there.

798
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,880
Hello?

799
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,880
Excuse me?

800
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,000
Yes, ma'am.

801
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,400
It's my car.

802
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,840
Fill 'er up.

803
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,760
No, I think
that it's-- it's--

804
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,880
the radiator,
it's overheating.

805
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,680
I don't know, it could
be a, what, hose?

806
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,560
Leaded or unleaded.

807
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,360
No, no.

808
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,200
It's the radiator.

809
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,320
We don't have unleaded.

810
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,880
No, it's the radiator.
The radiator.

811
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,920
Could be the radiator.

812
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,520
God.

813
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,440
Hello.

814
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,760
Enid.

815
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,600
Harry.

816
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,760
June.

817
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,080
Harry, thank God.

818
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,520
Listen, we got
to get Enid.

819
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,520
June, do you realize

820
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,240
you almost gave me
a fucking heart attack?

821
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,240
Give me a break here.

822
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,320
What exactly do you mean,
"We got to go get Enid"?

823
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,400
Well, she's buried.

824
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,280
I mean, she's not
really buried.

825
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,880
She's sort of half buried
somewhere in the desert

826
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,680
in this Indian burial
ground or something.

827
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,520
June, I'm supposed
to be on duty here.

828
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,040
I can't just drive
over there with Floyd.

829
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,480
What am I gonna tell him?

830
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,440
Enid is buried?

831
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,160
Half buried
in the desert somewhere,

832
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,600
and I got to go
look for her? God!

833
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,280
This guy saw me out there
already, Harry, okay.

834
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,200
The shit
is about to hit the fan.

835
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,240
Okay, where are you?

836
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,440
I'm at this gas station
on the 301.

837
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,360
It's about 5 miles north
of that El Vayo sign.

838
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,320
Harry, please hurry up.

839
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,040
He picks up
this machine gun

840
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,680
and throws it away
right through the door.

841
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,520
Ugh, blood everywhere--

842
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,080
- Floyd.
- Yeah.

843
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,720
Would you stop at the store?
I want to pick up

844
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,520
- some chocolates for Enid.
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

845
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,920
Anyway, so the guy
is standing there

846
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,360
at his dead
brother's feet.

847
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,000
His brother's blood
all over him.

848
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,760
He's holding this kitchen
knife in his hand.

849
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,880
Cars are funny things.

850
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,960
I reckon they
come off the assembly line

851
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,280
looking pretty much alike,

852
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,120
but I believe those cars
come off the assembly line

853
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,520
with a kind of soul.

854
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,240
They come out of there with
a destiny, same as you and me.

855
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,480
Floyd, you mind going in and
getting the chocolates for me?

856
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,240
I owe some money
from the last time,

857
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,560
and, well, I'm
a little short tonight.

858
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,480
I don't know, Harry.

859
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,040
You've been piss poor
company tonight, you know?

860
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:46,120
Hey, I'm sorry, man.

861
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,360
Really.

862
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,840
Something in a box
with flowers on it.

863
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,040
She likes flowers.

864
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,520
Hi, Henry.
Where's the chocolate?

865
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,400
I got to get
chocolate for him.

866
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,280
Shit.
My ass is grass, man.

867
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,120
I don't go down for murder,

868
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,360
I sure as hell
am gonna lose this job.

869
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,640
All right, open the cash box,
nice and easy.

870
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,360
Do as the man said,
motherfucker,

871
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,880
or I'll blow your
fucking head off.

872
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,280
I'm not playing
with you, shit head.

873
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,280
Five seconds,
open up that cash box.

874
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,480
Come on, come on.

875
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,760
You want to be dead meat,
motherfucker?

876
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,160
- Come on.
- Just a second.

877
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,520
One, two, three.

878
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,720
The dude's a fucking asshole.

879
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,640
Come on, motherfucker.

880
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,360
Do as the man says or I'll blow
your fucking head off.

881
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,480
Okay.

882
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,480
One two, three, four, five.

883
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:15,640
Here. Here. Here.

884
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,280
Freeze!

885
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:21,840
Shit.

886
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,280
Is everything okay?
You all right?

887
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,400
Yeah.

888
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,760
Harry?

889
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,480
Harry!

890
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,640
Harry!

891
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,160
Number 2,
number 2, Harry, you there?

892
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,200
Over.

893
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,920
Harry, there's been a hold up 
at the 7-Eleven over on Maple.

894
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,480
One guy is dead. 
The other one got away.

895
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,840
What?

896
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,440
Are you in pursuit 
or what?

897
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,360
We require 
assistance here.

898
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,840
Over.

899
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,560
Uh, yeah, Mave,
this is Harry.

900
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,560
I'm in pursuit.

901
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:17,520
Is Floyd okay?
Over.

902
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,360
Yeah, Floyd's okay, but he is 
shittin' himself, Harry.

903
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,440
He says that one guy 
saw the getaway car.

904
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,080
It's a yellow or orange 
Oldsmobile.

905
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,680
Is that the one, Harry? 
Over.

906
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,080
It's difficult to say, Mave.

907
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,080
It could be.

908
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,040
Over and out.

909
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,800
I believe those cars
come off the assembly line

910
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:40,600
with a kind of soul,
soul of their own.

911
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,360
They come out of there
with a destiny,

912
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,040
same as you and me.

913
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:48,520
Their lives are sort of
predestined if you get my drift.

914
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:51,160
You know what?

915
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,200
I think I'm just gonna fix
this thing when I get home.

916
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,720
No, you never know.

917
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,440
You could be right.

918
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,280
It could be--
she was just a little thirsty.

919
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:03,400
You got to learn how
to communicate with your car.

920
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,760
Well, take your time,
why don't you?

921
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,440
I've been waiting here
for hours.

922
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,000
You won't believe
what just happened.

923
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,680
I left Floyd
at the 7-Eleven.

924
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,400
Oh, never mind.
Come on, I'll follow you.

925
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,080
He was the one
who got me into this thing

926
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,760
in the first place.

927
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,360
If he didn't come on to me
at that party,

928
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,200
I would not be here 
right now, would I?

929
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,080
What a damn fool I was.

930
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,680
Her goddamn sister.

931
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,000
The same goddamn family.

932
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,600
I was lonely.

933
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,280
I was getting back at Enid.

934
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,040
That's it.

935
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,840
I was getting back at Enid.

936
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,200
Jesus H. Christ.

937
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,320
How can anybody be
so goddamn stupid?

938
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,680
How could you bury
someone accidentally?

939
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,800
Mother of God.

940
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,080
Sorry, I didn't know
you were gonna stop.

941
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,440
Jesus.

942
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,240
She looks so weird.

943
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,240
How did she get like this?

944
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,720
Listen, Harry, I'm tired,

945
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:45,800
I'm freezing, I'm fed up,

946
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:49,560
I'm sacred shitless,
and I think I'm going crazy,

947
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,760
so don't you ask me
any more stupid questions.

948
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,920
Okay?
I've had enough.

949
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,600
Well, that's a pretty
obvious question, June.

950
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,600
I think I've got every
right to ask you.

951
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,520
I can't take it
anymore, Harry, I can't.

952
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,680
I can't take it anymore.

953
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,280
Number 2, number 2,

954
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,640
Harry, you there? 
Over.

955
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,280
Okay.
Okay, don't get upset.

956
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:16,640
Number 2, number 2, what the hell is going on here?

957
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,720
Goddamn that Mavis.
You know, she drives me crazy.

958
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,120
Goddamn it, Harry, 
what's going on? Over.

959
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:24,040
Shit.

960
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,040
Stop playing with yourself 
and pick up the goddamn--

961
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,880
Uh, this is Harry, Mave.
Over.

962
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,040
Did you apprehend 
the suspect, Harry?

963
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,400
Uh, no, I didn't, Mave.

964
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,880
He got away about
10 miles north of town.

965
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,160
I'm on my way back.

966
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,640
Did you hear that?

967
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,400
There's been a robbery.

968
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,840
Floyd killed the guy.

969
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,720
Honey, if I don't
get back there,

970
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,320
they are gonna know
something's going on.

971
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:51,040
God. Okay.

972
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,560
Why don't you get
a motel for the night?

973
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,240
As soon as things
have calmed down,

974
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,400
I'll come out
and pick you up.

975
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,120
We can do it together.

976
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,960
Maybe take
a little nap, too.

977
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,280
Sort of freshen up.

978
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,120
I guess we better
get her in the trunk.

979
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:21,960
Just in case.

980
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,840
It'll be safer.

981
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,560
Oh.

982
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,400
Jesus Christ, June,
what happened here?

983
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,960
The bumper's hanging off.

984
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,240
Harry, you are
standing here

985
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:59,920
in the middle of
goddamn nowhere

986
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,800
with your dead wife
in your arms,

987
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:04,320
and you are worried about
your fucking bumper.

988
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,640
Well...

989
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,440
Just put her in the
trunk, Harry.

990
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,000
You know something, June.

991
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,480
You sounded just like Enid
when you said that.

992
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,240
Yeah.

993
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:21,000
And sometimes you just
piss me off so bad.

994
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:23,640
Yeah, well, I didn't used to.

995
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,080
Yeah, you're right.
You didn't used to.

996
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,200
Shit.

997
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,440
God.

998
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,800
What the hell
happened to you?

999
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,760
Do you have any vacancies?

1000
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,440
Come by way of
the sewer or something?

1001
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,200
What is with
the third degree?

1002
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,320
I just want a room.
It's a simple request.

1003
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,240
It's $25 tonight.

1004
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,200
Pay in advance.

1005
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,480
All right.

1006
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,640
You know, no guests.

1007
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,040
Room 10.

1008
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:00,200
I couldn't leave you out
in the cold, now could I, Enid?

1009
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,080
At least
it's warmer in here.

1010
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,760
So get ready

1011
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,920
for the most dazzling 
extravaganza of all.

1012
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,960
We proudly present 
the best of

1013
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,800
Lifestyles 
of the Rich and Famous.

1014
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:31,040
On our 100th edition, 
we are privileged

1015
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,760
to present a portrait 
of our own Queen Elizabeth.

1016
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,480
Come behind the glittering 
public image...

1017
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,200
Ah!

1018
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,240
Incoming!

1019
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,480
Oh, now look here.

1020
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,720
Thank you, Jesus.

1021
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,800
Hey!
Woo-hoo.

1022
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,520
Woo-hoo.

1023
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,120
Oh, God.

1024
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,600
Oh.

1025
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:47,480
Yes.

1026
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,200
Oh.

1027
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,080
I know you want me.

1028
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:02,040
You've just been
playing hard to get.

1029
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,320
I bet you can't
believe your luck,

1030
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,200
because I'm gonna ride you

1031
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:23,520
like a Harley
on a bad road.

1032
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,960
Stuck in this motel.

1033
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Harry is pissing
me off so bad.

1034
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,640
Just as much his fault
as it was mine.

1035
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,600
It's all gonna be over
soon, Enid, I swear.

1036
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,280
Harry is gonna
come over here

1037
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,840
and deal with this like he
should have in the first place.

1038
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:46,920
Okay?

1039
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,680
Ahh!
God.

1040
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,040
Hello?

1041
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:07,760
Excuse me?

1042
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:20,360
I cannot leave you alone
for one second, can I?

1043
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,160
Harry, I killed that man.

1044
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,960
You know,
it was him or me though.

1045
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,560
There's no question.

1046
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,480
He looked surprised.

1047
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,080
I heard the shots.

1048
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,080
I was about to come in when
I saw the guy running out.

1049
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,960
I figured I better
go after him.

1050
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,160
You know, well,
you did the right thing,

1051
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,920
there's no question.

1052
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,160
That's what
I would have done.

1053
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:04,480
Except
it makes me want to go.

1054
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:07,000
Ahh! Ahh!

1055
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,520
What are these people
doing here?

1056
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,960
I told you
no guests.

1057
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,360
Well, Enid was--
she was sleeping in--

1058
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,760
I don't care,
rules is rules.

1059
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,080
Now you
and your friends

1060
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,080
are gonna have to get
the hell out of here.

1061
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,480
But you don't understand.

1062
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,400
Well, I don't care
but, you know.

1063
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,840
TV set blaring,
throwing parties.

1064
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,000
You're fucking crazy,
you know that?

1065
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:28,480
Phew.

1066
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,560
Well, if you're not out
of here in 5 minutes,

1067
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:31,760
I'm calling the cops.

1068
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,200
Well, this
is just great, Enid.

1069
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:46,160
You are starting
to really piss me off.

1070
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,240
Oh, my God.

1071
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:02,920
Let's just--

1072
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:11,600
I cannot take it anymore.

1073
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:15,280
Do you hear me?

1074
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,640
No more!

1075
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:18,840
Okay?

1076
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:33,440
Thank you very much,
I appreciate it.

1077
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:36,400
Really appreciate it from
the very bottom of my soul.

1078
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,600
Exactly what
I needed today.

1079
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,440
Exactly
what I needed.

1080
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:12,480
Well, you see,
Officer, we were--

1081
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:15,520
we were crossin'
this bridge here,

1082
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:20,840
and, uh, this tree
just fell across the road,

1083
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,640
and she swerved and...

1084
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,520
I mean, Enid had had
a hell of a lot to drink.

1085
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,720
And she just sort of...

1086
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,640
...missed the bridge.

1087
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,840
She must have hit
her head on something,

1088
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,880
like, the window
or the dashboard, maybe.

1089
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:54,080
Luckily, I managed
to jump out just in time.

1090
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:04,840
Bye, Enid.

1091
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,600
Oh, God.

1092
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:48,360
Oh, I think I got it.

1093
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,720
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

1094
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,480
Joe.

1095
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,560
Wait a minute.

1096
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:59,720
Look,
over on the road.

1097
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,160
Thank you.
Thank you, God.

1098
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,560
Thank you.

1099
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,440
Holy shit,
there's a dead body.

1100
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:05,640
There's a dead body.

1101
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:17,400
All right, all right,
now calm down, honey.

1102
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:20,400
Just hold your tiny
horses here.

1103
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,760
Would you mind
repeating that?

1104
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,160
Uh-huh.

1105
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,640
Oh, boy.

1106
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:31,000
All right, where
are you now, honey?

1107
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,400
All right,
just, um,

1108
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,240
we're gonna send the car
out there right away.

1109
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:37,120
You wait right there by
the phone, right where you are.

1110
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:38,480
All right.

1111
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:40,080
That was a couple of kids.

1112
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:44,800
They say they just witnessed
a murder out by Sanchez River.

1113
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:55,360
Harry, it's your cousin
Annabelle.

1114
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,720
God, where
the hell is Floyd?

1115
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:58,720
There's been a murder
by Sanchez River.

1116
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,360
Hello.

1117
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:03,720
Harry, you are gonna
be so proud of me.

1118
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:06,800
I did it. 
I finally did it.

1119
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,160
Did what?

1120
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:09,920
Dumped her.

1121
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:12,040
Oh, God.

1122
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,480
That's great.

1123
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:17,480
God, honey, that's the best
news I heard all night.

1124
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:19,600
- Where?
- Sanchez River.

1125
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:23,880
- Where?
- Sanchez.

1126
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:27,320
About three miles 
north--

1127
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,480
You dumped her
in the Sanchez River?

1128
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,200
Yeah. 
I'm so relieved.

1129
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:34,400
I can't believe 
it is finally over.

1130
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:36,200
I mean, I thought I was 
startin' to lose it, Harry.

1131
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:37,360
I mean, for a minute 
there, I thought--

1132
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,760
Oh, my God.

1133
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,960
Holy shit.
Come on, Harry, let's go.

1134
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,600
I'll be right there.

1135
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,440
- Wait for me in the car.
- All right. Now hurry up.

1136
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:48,080
Harry, what's wrong?
What's going on?

1137
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:51,640
Honey, someone
saw you dump the car.

1138
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:54,040
They just called.

1139
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:57,280
June, you have to try 
to get the car out.

1140
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:58,760
Do you hear me?

1141
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,400
Get the car out fast.

1142
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,280
We're on our way 
out there now.

1143
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,400
I dream of nights like this.

1144
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:23,960
Yeah.

1145
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,120
Come on.

1146
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,400
Floyd,
for Christ sake,

1147
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:55,800
we're only going to talk
to a couple of witnesses.

1148
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,640
Harry, the guy
might still be hanging around.

1149
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:00,640
After dumping a body?
Give me a break.

1150
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,360
God, Harry,
when are you gonna start

1151
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,280
to learn to think
like a criminal?

1152
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,400
Goddamn it!

1153
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,160
Get up!

1154
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,040
Get up!

1155
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,040
Ahh!

1156
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,320
God shit.

1157
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,720
- Zip it up.
- You called us?

1158
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:30,160
Ugh.
I got to go, Floyd.

1159
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:32,680
I'm going to the river,
you stay with them.

1160
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,040
No.

1161
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,920
Harry, come back.

1162
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:40,200
What did he
do that for?

1163
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:41,920
Goddamn it.
Move over.

1164
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:44,160
I'm commandeering
this vehicle

1165
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,200
in the name
of the Las Moscas police force.

1166
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:51,360
I've been having a little
trouble with the starter.

1167
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,920
She will start
if you're a little patient.

1168
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:55,560
Son of a bitch.

1169
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:10,240
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

1170
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,200
Sir, can I--

1171
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,080
God Almighty.

1172
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,120
June.

1173
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,680
June.

1174
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:16,640
Is this it, Harry?

1175
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:17,880
Am I arrested?

1176
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,680
No, honey.

1177
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:22,160
But you will be if we don't
get this car out of here fast.

1178
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,600
Floyd's gonna
pull up any minute.

1179
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:26,560
Now look,
you stay here,

1180
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:27,920
I'm gonna get
a rope down to you.

1181
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,320
We're gonna tow it out.

1182
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,960
Mavis, it's not
my damn fault.

1183
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,920
Harry just
took off in the car.

1184
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,280
What
do you mean took off, Floyd?

1185
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,040
- Whose car?
 - My car!

1186
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,400
I don't get it, Floyd. 
Your patrol car?

1187
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:40,400
Oh, Mavis, you're so dumb.
Would you listen to me?

1188
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,760
Oh, my God.

1189
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,800
Are you okay, Harry?

1190
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:16,680
Harry?

1191
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:30,120
Tie the rope
to the rear axle, June.

1192
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,400
Where's that?

1193
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:41,640
In between
the rear wheels, June.

1194
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,560
No, no, no, no.

1195
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,240
What are you doing?

1196
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,200
We're gonna have
to torch the car.

1197
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:03,040
We?
What do you mean "we"?

1198
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:05,120
I'm not gonna have anything
more to do with it, Harry.

1199
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,400
- I'm going home.
- Well, go on then.

1200
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,960
We'll put her
in the trunk.

1201
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:36,200
- Oh, God.
- Been doing that a lot.

1202
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:44,080
I'm off duty
in an hour.

1203
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:47,880
Go back to the house,
I'll meet you there.

1204
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:50,520
We're gonna figure
something out.

1205
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:51,840
June?

1206
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,840
- Harry.
- What?

1207
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:02,560
Nothing.

1208
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:04,520
Hurry up, June,
for Christ sakes.

1209
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:20,440
You don't understand.

1210
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:28,200
Didn't mean to do it.
It was a mistake.

1211
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:30,720
She made me do it.

1212
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:42,280
She's the one
that's doing this to me now.

1213
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,720
It's just weird
or something.

1214
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,880
And it isn't you
at all, God, is it?

1215
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,200
It's her.

1216
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:11,120
It's her playing
the games.

1217
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:04,000
Oh, God.

1218
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,360
Ahh!

1219
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:15,960
Shit.

1220
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,440
Looks like you got yourself
a little problem here.

1221
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:08,800
Oh, why don't you
just arrest me?

1222
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,960
Get it over with.

1223
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,280
For what?

1224
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,320
For killing my sister.

1225
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:20,280
What?

1226
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:23,760
What difference
does it make?

1227
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:28,520
Come on.

1228
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:33,160
I'll show you.

1229
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:48,400
Ma'am.

1230
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:07,840
Holy shit, you're alive.

1231
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:31,400
Get your feet.

1232
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:32,800
Get your feet in here.

1233
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,520
Jesus Christ!

1234
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:07,760
I only hit you
with that clown.

1235
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:11,120
You tried to hit me
with that tire iron.

1236
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:13,000
You tried to kill me,
didn't you?

1237
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,200
You thought that it was
me opening that trunk.

1238
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,880
Harry's just not
gonna believe this.

1239
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,440
Oh.

1240
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:28,520
Oh, he has been going crazy.

1241
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:29,600
He really has.

1242
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:34,960
I mean, he--

1243
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,840
he's gonna be so overjoyed
that you are not dead.

1244
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:44,960
I'm sorry I hit you
with the clown.

1245
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,880
He's gonna be so happy.

1246
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:53,280
You know something?

1247
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:55,800
So am I.

1248
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:58,200
Harry's just not
gonna believe this.

1249
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:06,400
Jesus.

1250
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,440
Oh, Harry.

1251
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,640
You can move your car.

1252
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:34,840
I ran out of gas.

1253
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:38,480
So you're my taxi cab, got it?

1254
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,240
Taxi cab?
Why am I his taxi cab?

1255
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:41,720
And drive me
back to your house

1256
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,120
before these scumbags
track me down.

1257
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:44,720
I'm not going anywhere,

1258
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:46,720
I'm gonna stay
right here, that's it.

1259
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,400
- I'm not taking this anymore.
- Honey, don't get me ugly.

1260
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:50,240
- Now drive!
- I'm not just doing anything.

1261
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:52,680
I ain't feeling
too charitable, chicky.

1262
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,160
You step on it or you die.

1263
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,480
You got that?
Do you copy, huh?

1264
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,080
Will you shut the fuck up?

1265
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,080
Lady, you just
ran out of luck.

1266
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,080
Oh, God.

1267
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:10,520
You're all out to get me,
aren't you?

1268
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,360
Every single goddamn
one of you.

1269
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:18,880
Well, I am not gonna
take it anymore.

1270
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:22,680
Will you stop
this fucking car?

1271
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:24,080
I'm gonna get out of here.

1272
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:25,600
I'm getting out of here.

1273
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:29,040
Where the fuck
are you going?

1274
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:51,840
Harry.

1275
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:53,120
Listen, buddy, I got
some bad news for you.

1276
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:58,000
It's Enid. We found this.

1277
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:02,400
Body was burned
beyond recognition.

1278
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:05,600
It's cinder, Harry.

1279
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:07,840
I'm talkin'
Cajun style, man.

1280
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:09,680
I mean,
completely burned up.

1281
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:10,800
Leave out the graphic detail,
will ya?

1282
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:16,080
Oh, Harry,
I'm so sorry, buddy.

1283
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:17,280
Oh, my God.

1284
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,280
I'm sorry, Harry.

1285
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:45,200
Harry, you want
some company?

1286
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:47,160
Oh, no, Floyd.

1287
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,160
I think I'd rather be alone.

1288
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,320
Oh, June.

1289
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:50,360
Is June sleeping
or is she just pretending?

1290
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,640
Hey, Jackson.

1291
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:04,280
Goddamn.

1292
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,560
Setting fire to the car
in the middle of town

1293
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:09,000
wasn't exactly
what I had in mind, honey.

1294
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:09,680
It's a little risky, you know.

1295
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,120
It's okay.

1296
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:14,800
We made it.

1297
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:16,120
It's all over now.

1298
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:23,800
Hey, you still mad at me?

1299
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Come on.

1300
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:33,520
Oh, baby,
you must be exhausted.

1301
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:06,280
Oh, God.

1302
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:11,200
He really loved that woman.
