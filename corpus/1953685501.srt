1
00:00:56,683 --> 00:00:59,436
It is the biggest cash robbery
in U.S. history--

2
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:01,438
$8 million taken

3
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:03,690
from an armored-car company
office in New York City.

4
00:01:03,857 --> 00:01:04,858
There may have been close

5
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,693
to $30 million here yesterday,

6
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,863
all in cash,
mostly 50s and hundreds.

7
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:11,865
A task force of FBI agents

8
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:14,492
and New York City detectives
are trying to solve

9
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:16,870
the biggest cash robbery
in U.S. history.

10
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:19,539
FBI and New York City
police investigators

11
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:22,459
swarmed over the roof
of a Bronx armored-truck company

12
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,419
after thieves cut a hole in the roof

13
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:27,213
and made off with the largest
cash theft in U.S. history.

14
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,049
Police also said that a television
camera pointed at the vault

15
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:31,885
had been moved,
leading to speculation

16
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:33,720
that the burglars
had inside help.

17
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:36,222
At this point not one penny
has been recovered.

18
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:39,392
But FBI officials say they're
working on a number of good leads

19
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:42,103
and are optimistic
about finding the money.

20
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,565
If I knew, I would be out there
with a shovel looking for it.

21
00:01:45,732 --> 00:01:48,443
We really don't know
right at the moment.

22
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:53,406
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

23
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:55,909
Two questions for you, Eddie:

24
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,746
Where's Chris?

25
00:02:06,336 --> 00:02:08,505
And where's the money?

26
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:23,269
I quit.

27
00:02:23,436 --> 00:02:24,854
Fucking douchebags.

28
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:27,398
<i>-</i> Naw, you're fired.
- What?

29
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:29,234
- You're fired.
<i>-</i> No, bro, I quit.

30
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,778
You can't quit. You quit every week
from somewhere different.

31
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:33,404
- You're fired.
<i>-</i> Yeah, that's right.

32
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,615
- Yeah, I fucking quit, all right?
<i>-</i> Oh, shut up.

33
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:37,992
- You're fired.
<i>-</i> What? What's that?

34
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,578
Yo, you want me to pick up trash?
What fucking color do I look like?

35
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:42,622
<i>-</i> You are the trash, you little fuck.
- Motherfucker.

36
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:44,165
Yo yo yo Yo Y°-

37
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:46,209
What, you want some?

38
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:48,753
- Get going, get outta here.
<i>-</i> How about that, you fat fuck?

39
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,296
- Come on.
<i>-</i> Get outta here, get going.

40
00:02:50,463 --> 00:02:52,090
<i>-</i> Come on, let's go.
- And you're fired!

41
00:02:52,257 --> 00:02:54,384
- You're fired!
<i>-</i> I quit, motherfucker.

42
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:57,345
No no no, you're fired!

43
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,144
Yo, what the fuck?

44
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:07,021
<i>-</i> That was your boss?
- Yeah.

45
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:08,898
Yeah, he wants me
to clean up garbage.

46
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:11,568
I'm like, "Yo, what color
do I look like to you again, asshole?"

47
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,486
I hate Italians, bro.

48
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:16,322
Nothing's worse than working
for Italians, let me tell you.

49
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:18,825
Only thing worse than working
for Italians is working for the Greeks,

50
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:21,661
and I have to go back and work
at that stupid diner again.

51
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:25,665
Bullshit. The guy's
a straight-up douche, bro.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,460
He's telling me he thinks
I'm stealing and stuff.

53
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:31,087
You said you were.

54
00:03:32,589 --> 00:03:35,133
I was, but he's still a dick.
How about that?

55
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,510
Only thing worse is the Greeks.

56
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:39,637
Hey, what's up, ladies?

57
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:41,347
Yo, any of you girls

58
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:42,849
wanna do me right now, I'm down.

59
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:45,226
Eleni must be real stupid
marrying you, idiot!

60
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:46,853
- Suck it!
<i>-</i> Douchebag!

61
00:03:48,313 --> 00:03:51,357
There's a rainbow
over my shoulder

62
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:56,321
When you came,
my cup runneth over

63
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:59,908
You gave me your heavenly love

64
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:04,203
And if one night
you hear crying from above

65
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,205
'Cause heaven

66
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:10,043
Must be missing an angel

67
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:14,005
Missing one angel child

68
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:17,634
Because you're here
with me right now

69
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:21,804
Your love is heavenly

70
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:24,057
Bab)!

71
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:28,019
Heavenly to me, baby

72
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:30,647
Oooh, heaven

73
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:35,610
- Oooh, heaven...
- Enough with the chickens, Karen.

74
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:38,071
You gotta stop with the chickens.

75
00:04:39,072 --> 00:04:40,823
She's crazy about the chickens.

76
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,543
- Eh, fucking bit my lip.
- Hey, give me a hand with this.

77
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,545
Son of a bitch.
Bit my lip.

78
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:57,340
Hey, are you really
gonna marry Eleni?

79
00:04:57,507 --> 00:05:00,510
<i>- You sound like my mother.
- You're not gonna marry nobody.</i>

80
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:03,763
Not for nothing, bro, but if they make
a statue of me, I want big balls.

81
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,224
- Know what I'm saying?
<i>-</i> Hey, Ma!

82
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:08,267
<i>- We come bearing gifts.
- What's this?</i>

83
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:10,311
I got you a statue--
the statue you wanted.

84
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:11,813
<i>-</i> Nice.
- Hey.

85
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,190
Do I get a kiss?
Thank you.

86
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:16,818
<i>- Where did you get this?
- You could put a plant in it.</i>

87
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:18,444
<i>- What, you don't like it?
- It's nice, it's nice.</i>

88
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:19,988
- Put it right there.
- Put it over here?

89
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:22,073
<i>-</i> Yeah, right there against the wall.
- Okay.

90
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,117
- Nice.
<i>-</i> I'm just saying if you don't like it,

91
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,661
<i>-</i> we can take it back.
- I like it, I like it!

92
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:28,121
- It's nice.
<i>-</i> Where, over here?

93
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,331
<i>-</i> You want it on this thing?
- Mrs. Potamitis--

94
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:32,208
- Hey, Ma.
<i>-</i> Please be careful with those plants.

95
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,793
- Stand it up, stand it up.
<i>-</i> You want it somewhere...

96
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,169
<i>-</i> You like that?
- That's good.

97
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:37,088
<i>-</i> There we go. How about that?
- You like that?

98
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:39,924
- Ma!
<i>-</i> It's good, I like it. It's beautiful.

99
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:41,259
What do you want me
to do with the turtle?

100
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:42,927
Would you like me to tell you
what to do with the turtle?

101
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:44,762
<i>- Put it down and don't break it.
- You don't like it?</i>

102
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:46,973
- Put that over there.
- Thank you, Chris. It's very nice.

103
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,766
<i>- You like that, Ma?
- Thank you, yes, thank you.</i>

104
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:51,102
<i>- We got presents for you.
- Good good good.</i>

105
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:53,813
You be good today, all right?
Be careful, all right?

106
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,732
You want me to move it,
I move it again.

107
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:57,650
You don't like it, we'll take it back.

108
00:05:57,817 --> 00:05:59,318
- Go go go.
<i>-</i> You don't have to do it, you know?

109
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:01,404
All right, enough! Go.

110
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:03,197
Okay, love you, Ma.

111
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:37,607
Hey, Spiro.
My father around?

112
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:40,443
In the shitter, kid.

113
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:51,287
- H6Y-
- H6Y-

114
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:53,372
Chris.

115
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:56,834
They got you doing everything
around here, huh, Pop?

116
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:58,086
Yeah.

117
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,799
You know, this is what happens
when you have too many skills, right?

118
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:05,343
So where's the girl?

119
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,636
Uh, I don't know.

120
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:08,638
I was just seeing
if you need a ride home.

121
00:07:08,805 --> 00:07:10,723
<i>-</i> You know, checking up on you.
- Come in here on a Friday night

122
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,226
<i>-</i> to give me a ride home?
- No no, I didn't say--

123
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:14,852
I'm worried about you.
What are you doing?

124
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:16,562
Just stopping bY

125
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,446
What, I come in,
everybody goes quiet?

126
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,073
No no, we were just talking.

127
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,408
You don't like that fat asshole

128
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:31,536
talking that way about your father.

129
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:34,163
Chris doesn't need
to worry about his father.

130
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,666
No no, you're right, Tommy.
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:40,002
But we agree
he's a fat asshole though.

132
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,171
I come here with respect.
He should do the same.

133
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:44,590
Respect. Bravo.

134
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:47,301
Respect-- who gives a shit?
You sound like your father now.

135
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,971
- Hey, Spiro.
<i>-</i> Now, Tommy, I understand him.

136
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:52,682
<i>- I know what you're saying.
- Get your hands off him, okay?</i>

137
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:55,601
What the hell are you doing?
What the hell is that?

138
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:56,936
- Wow.
<i>-</i> I'm sorry, okay?

139
00:07:57,103 --> 00:07:58,104
You don't need to touch him.

140
00:07:58,271 --> 00:08:00,398
Are you kidding me?
Is he kidding me right now?

141
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:02,275
Okay, just-- you don't
need to touch him.

142
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,610
I just want to know, so you don't
want me to touch your father?

143
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:06,737
<i>-</i> You don't need to fucking touch him.
- Spiro!

144
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,781
<i>-</i> Get him outta here.
- Stop it, enough!

145
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:10,950
<i>-</i> Who you want me to touch?
- Enough! Spiro!

146
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:12,201
<i>- No, it's okay, it's okay.
- What are you doing?</i>

147
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:13,953
I just want to know
who it is that I can touch.

148
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,872
<i>- Just calm down, take it easy.
- Whoa whoa whoa.</i>

149
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,416
It's okay, we're fine.
The kid's just excitable.

150
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,418
He's all right.
It's okay, just got excited.

151
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:22,295
<i>- He'll be okay.
- Go.</i>

152
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:23,921
Go. I said go now.

153
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:25,715
I said go! Go 90!

154
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,348
Spiro, listen,
you're a powerful man.

155
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,809
You gave me a job that I need,
but you don't speak with me

156
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:38,978
like that in front
of my son again, hmm?

157
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:41,272
Cr?

158
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:43,858
Or you just don't.

159
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:47,904
Let's hope it doesn't
come to that, okay, Tommy?

160
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:53,075
We'll be fine, no problems.
That's kids, right? They're excitable.

161
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:11,969
How you doing? Okay?

162
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,389
Yeah, I'm all right.
Are you okay?

163
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,850
Me? Yeah sure, fine. I'm fine.

164
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:22,438
Yo, Vicky, put some clothes on.
What's wrong with you?

165
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,690
- Hey.
<i>-</i> Shut up, just checking the mail.

166
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,692
- Hey.
<i>-</i> Ma, you see what Vicky's wearing?

167
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:28,736
- Mind your business.
<i>-</i> Shut your fucking face, Chris.

168
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:30,696
Hey, Victoria,
watch your mouth.

169
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,990
<i>-</i> Looks like a tramp dressed like that.
- Hey.

170
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:35,409
Chris, don't talk to your sister
like that, come on.

171
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,370
Vicky, go upstairs,
put on a dress or something nice.

172
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:38,871
None of the girls wear
dresses any more, Daddy.

173
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:41,290
I don't care if the other girls
dress like tramps.

174
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:43,376
<i>- Thomasos, please.
- Gotta dress like a decent person.</i>

175
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,044
<i>- It's too early for this.
- I want her to dress nice.</i>

176
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:47,046
- Leave her alone. And you.
<i>-</i> She's got no clothes on, Mom.

177
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:50,716
What'd I say?
I can't win. Unbelievable.

178
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:52,969
In my own house.

179
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:56,847
I know you hate working

180
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,766
for those jerks at the club, Pop.

181
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,977
It's okay. Everything's good.

182
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:04,397
<i>- You gotta do what you gotta do.
- Yeah.</i>

183
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,649
I know.
But I want to help.

184
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:08,734
You know?
And when I get this job with the police,

185
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:10,945
I can put the whole family
on the insurance, you know?

186
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:13,739
Yeah. My son the giant.

187
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:15,658
Come on, Dad.
I'm being serious.

188
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:18,995
You know, when I was
a policeman back in Greece,

189
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:21,998
my first arrest was
a man beating a chicken.

190
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:24,125
That's a true story.

191
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:26,335
Made you feel good though, right?

192
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:28,546
<i>- What, the chicken?
- Come on, I'm serious.</i>

193
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:31,090
<i>- It made you feel good though, right?
- I felt good.</i>

194
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:33,467
That's good.

195
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,928
It's what I wanna do, you know?
I wanna be a cop.

196
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:38,556
I wanna do what you did, Pop.

197
00:10:38,723 --> 00:10:42,601
- It's all I wanna do.
- Okay.

198
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:46,522
You concentrate on that.
That's good. You'll get that.

199
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:48,607
That's nice.
See, now you're wearing...

200
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:50,443
some clothes. This is good.

201
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,611
<i>-</i> Like a decent gir-- young lady.
- Nothing!

202
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,947
That's a beautiful, uh, shirt.

203
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:56,699
<i>- Yeah.
- That's nice-- Vicky!</i>

204
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:58,367
Oh shit.

205
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:02,621
- What is this?
<i>-</i> It must be the date to take the test.

206
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,999
Ah, see, good things.
This is good.

207
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,671
You gotta be kidding me.

208
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:16,135
Officer Potamitis,
when's the big test?

209
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:18,304
- I don't know. Jerk-offs here?
- In the back.

210
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:21,474
<i>- Smells like an open asshole back here.
- Hey, shut the fuck up, Eddie.</i>

211
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,434
Maybe you should be
keeping your old job,

212
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:25,144
if you don't like
how it smells here, eh?

213
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,063
It smells like dogshit.
What's up, bro?

214
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,981
Yo, you see Mike's
new DeVille outside

215
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:31,108
with the hydraulic system and shit?

216
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:32,985
Stereo cassette?
Fuck him.

217
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:35,363
<i>- Yeah, it's a pussy magnet.
- A lot of pussy.</i>

218
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,656
<i>-</i> I gotta talk with you.
- Me?

219
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:39,784
- Come on.
<i>-</i> Hey, where'd you get that?

220
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:43,162
Smith and Weston's.

221
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:45,164
You gonna turn us in,
Officer Potamitis?

222
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:48,376
Huh? Don't worry, we only use it
for Colombian insurance.

223
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,544
Yeah, tell him the shit you got
with the Puerto Ricans.

224
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,339
<i>-</i> There's-- it's fucking-- I'm serious.
- Colombians, okay?

225
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:55,674
And when you have money,
Eddie, you're serious.

226
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:58,052
Until then, here.
Have some more fries.

227
00:11:58,219 --> 00:11:59,678
Shit.

228
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:01,680
- Time?
<i>-</i> Yeah, speaking of Colombians.

229
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,349
We gotta go to Papagalo's.

230
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:05,184
Oh yeah? Cool.

231
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:06,769
All right, boys.

232
00:12:08,104 --> 00:12:09,605
See you boys later, all right?

233
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,364
What?
What, they got fries.

234
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:20,366
Those assholes are
swimming in money, bro.

235
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:23,494
Look at us looking for bullshit jobs--
you studying to become a cop. For what?

236
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:25,079
I'm trying
to do something with my life.

237
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:28,165
Now a waste of time
'cause you're a stupid shit.

238
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:31,335
- What did I do?
<i>-</i> The fucking Black Sabbath concert.

239
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,838
Now 'cause of that
I can't even apply to be a cop no more.

240
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,382
Black Sabbath concert was
like a million years ago, bro.

241
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:38,717
It stayed on my record.
I should fucking kill you for it.

242
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,886
<i>-</i> It's a fucking joint, bro.
- You think I don't know that?

243
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:42,388
Yo, that sucks, bro.
I'm sorry.

244
00:12:42,555 --> 00:12:44,306
Let me take you to Papagalo's,
buy you a drink.

245
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:47,226
<i>-</i> You ain't got no money.
- I got money, come on.

246
00:12:47,393 --> 00:12:48,727
I'm gonna go do a piss.

247
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:51,355
<i>-</i> Yo, I'm sorry bro.
- Yeah.

248
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:52,940
Honestly, that sucks, bro.

249
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:55,901
- Come on, drinks on me.
- You ain't got no money.

250
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:59,196
Call me later.

251
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:13,294
The rain is miserable.

252
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:15,212
Sorry I'm late, Mr. L.

253
00:13:17,173 --> 00:13:19,133
<i>-</i> Hey, Nance.
- Hey.

254
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:24,430
I saw Vicky. She said you're not
taking the cop test no more?

255
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:26,849
- Uh...
<i>-</i> Because of Eddie?

256
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:28,100
Yeah, you know.

257
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:30,019
And my mother got
a thing for him, so.

258
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:32,605
<i>- Yeah, he's an idiot.
- Yeah.</i>

259
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,774
All right, well,
if you need anything,

260
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,068
an umbrella or whatever, I'm here.

261
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,571
Okay, thanks, Nance.

262
00:13:57,463 --> 00:13:59,507
All I can say is I've already
got a weapons permit.

263
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:02,009
I can work nights, weekends,
whatever you want.

264
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:05,137
I've been studying to be with the force
since I was old enough to read.

265
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:07,973
Yeah, I'm sure the boss would
be real impressed with that.

266
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:10,893
Look, my friend,
this ain't the NYPD.

267
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,353
I hope you can understand that.

268
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,396
Yeah yeah, I understand that.

269
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:17,191
And are you okay
with the $200 a week?

270
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:21,320
Yuh... I was making
50 a night working at a club.

271
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:24,406
Well, you've already got a job!
How lucky are you?

272
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,825
Hey, Mary, let's send
somebody else up here, okay?

273
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,827
Uh, the club closed,
so I'll take it.

274
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:30,579
Oh.

275
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:32,414
I thought so.

276
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:34,166
Okay then.

277
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:37,169
Welcome aboard.

278
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:48,097
Is it hot enough for you here, huh?

279
00:14:48,264 --> 00:14:50,349
Frigging air conditioner
ain't working.

280
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:52,768
They're gonna fix it. They keep
telling me they're gonna fix it,

281
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:54,603
but who the hell knows?

282
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,065
You keep playing with that thing,
you're gonna blow your balls off, man.

283
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:00,067
Or worse-- mine.

284
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,152
Yeah, sorry. I just, uh--

285
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:04,989
You can't believe they gave you
a gun on your first day, huh?

286
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,491
Yeah, I mean I never even shot
anything before, you know?

287
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:11,287
Just remember, the vest is
for your heart, not your balls, so.

288
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:14,832
You're Chris, right?

289
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,834
- Yeah.
<i>-</i> Yeah, that's right, yeah yeah.

290
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:19,336
I'm Tony.
Well, I told you that already.

291
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:22,715
And this--
Marie and Giana.

292
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:25,050
That's my wife and little girl.

293
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:28,887
They're the only thing keeping me
from driving this over the border.

294
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:32,850
So anyways, we do about
eight to 10 pick-ups a day.

295
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:35,227
Then we drive around and drop it off,

296
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:36,937
drive some more, get some more,

297
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,731
the owners take some off the top,

298
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,066
and then Wednesday morning
we go back to the Reserve.

299
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:44,194
Done. Beautiful. Brain surgery.

300
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,322
Wait, the owners are taking money?

301
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,240
Yeah well,
it's the bosses' rule,

302
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,701
but hell, they can do whatever
the hell they want in here.

303
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:52,953
A lot of monkey business
all I know is going on.

304
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,581
Knowing too much will
drive you crazy, anyway.

305
00:15:55,748 --> 00:15:59,001
Just keep it simple, do your job,

306
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:01,462
find a girl, buy a house. Okay.

307
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:02,963
So this is how it goes.

308
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,591
We pick the money up,
we lock it in the back here with you.

309
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:07,468
<i>- Lock in the back.
- We're only talking</i>

310
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:09,053
83 grand or so.

311
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:12,222
That's it. One of these bags
can hold 250 easy.

312
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,808
Biggest load I ever had
was six million.

313
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,852
- It's crazy, huh?
<i>-</i> Hey, you want to shut the--

314
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,729
No no no, it's fine.
Just stay on your toes.

315
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:20,606
You stay out here.
I'll be in and out quick.

316
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:23,067
- Hey, Sal!
<i>-</i> Yeah yeah.

317
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,652
Oh what, did you get a haircut?

318
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:26,862
Hey, officer.

319
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:28,489
- Hey, kid.
<i>-</i> Whoa whoa whoa!

320
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:30,074
<i>-</i> What, are you crazy?
- Whoa whoa.

321
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,159
What the hell's the matter with you?

322
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,119
Wait till I tell your father about this.

323
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:36,789
<i>-</i> You could have gotten yourself killed.
- Hey, partner.

324
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,457
Try and not let
somebody sneak up on you.

325
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:40,959
<i>-</i> Yeah yeah. Sorry sorry.
- Yeah, all right.

326
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:44,129
When we're hauling loot, you're gonna
be on shotgun duty back here.

327
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:45,839
<i>- All right, back here.
- You got that?</i>

328
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,299
- All right.
<i>-</i> All right, good.

329
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:50,636
All right, so guard it like
it was your mother's 83 grand.

330
00:16:50,803 --> 00:16:53,138
<i>-</i> Want me to stay back here?
- Yeah, do what you want.

331
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:55,724
- Okay.
<i>-</i> A lot of salami in those bags, huh?

332
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:58,102
- Yeah, no kidding.
<i>-</i> Trust me when I say

333
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,312
I know what
you're thinking back there.

334
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,647
Trust me, I do.

335
00:17:01,814 --> 00:17:04,191
Cash makes people
do some crazy shit.

336
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:06,860
<i>-</i> You gotta keep your head about you.
- Okay.

337
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,445
It's hot as hell back there, right?

338
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,406
Uh, no shit.

339
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:15,411
Yeah well,
you'll get used to it, buddy.

340
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:22,042
Listen,
it's my daughter's birthday,

341
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:24,044
so I gotta get out
of here early, okay?

342
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,797
- Okay, sounds good.
<i>-</i> While they sort through the bags,

343
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:28,173
do whatever the hell they do,

344
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,800
I'll walk you through the process.

345
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:32,094
Coming in!

346
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:35,222
Wait, they're not gonna care that you're
leaving me alone to put away the money?

347
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,975
Who, the boss?
A bunch of criminals up there.

348
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:39,768
Don't worry yourself over it.

349
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:41,687
We just do our thing up here.

350
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:43,856
Okay,

351
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,816
so the keys to the lock up

352
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,610
<i>-</i> are kept right here.
- Whatever you say.

353
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,154
Minimum wage.

354
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:54,158
Come on,
I'll show you the good stuff.

355
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:58,370
Anyway, this-- this is okay?

356
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:01,290
I don't know. Ask him.

357
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:04,042
One, two, three, four.

358
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:06,336
They're not very creative here.

359
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,547
Yeah, no shit.

360
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:10,174
And there it is.

361
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:13,093
$25 million.

362
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,597
- That's $25 million?
<i>-</i> Give or take a couple of 'em.

363
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:18,557
Of a million?!

364
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:21,101
Hey, whoa whoa whoa.

365
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:23,103
Watch out.
There's a camera right there.

366
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,355
<i>-</i> Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

367
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,900
Okay, so after
they're done upstairs

368
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:31,195
we drop it in here,
it piles up until it's full.

369
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:34,072
Half the time the drivers
don't even bring it upstairs first.

370
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,949
So how do they know
how much is in there?

371
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,202
They don't.

372
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,578
<i>-</i> They don't?
- No.

373
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:41,997
<i>-</i> So if some goes missing--
- If some goes missing,

374
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:44,041
it wouldn't be the first time
around here, pal.

375
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,751
Oh hey hey!

376
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:47,586
- Hey, come on.
<i>-</i> There's a dog in there?

377
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:49,880
Yeah, there's a dog.
Come here, this is Barney.

378
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:52,424
I forgot to--
he's deaf as a doornail,

379
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:53,926
- the poor old guy.
- What, he lives in that?

380
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,969
He lives in there with the money.
Come on, go ahead.

381
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,055
<i>-</i> It's crazy. No shit.
- Go back to bed.

382
00:18:58,222 --> 00:18:59,431
Oh.

383
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,517
Hey, that's Maria now.
Come on.

384
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:02,768
I gotta lock this up.

385
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:07,940
Now remember, your partner here
came down with a severe head cold.

386
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,274
- Got it.
- All right?

387
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,401
- Yeah.
<i>-</i> You gotta get my back on this one.

388
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,906
- You got it.
<i>-</i> Put those keys back behind the desk.

389
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:18,617
<i>-</i> I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

390
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,746
Fucking dog.

391
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,976
Boy, what, are you taking
a night off, Pop?

392
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:45,978
Hey.

393
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:49,064
No, I was just taking
a little break.

394
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:51,775
Well, good for you.

395
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:56,321
<i>- What's going on here?
- They let your father go.</i>

396
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:59,783
- What?
<i>-</i> After 10 years, no warning.

397
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,160
<i>-</i> Enough, dear. Enough, dear.
- Nice people, huh?

398
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,538
What, because of that thing
in the bathroom the other night?

399
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:06,999
<i>-</i> Mm-hmm, of course that's why.
- It's fine, really, enough.

400
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,126
- That's it.
<i>-</i> No no, it's not fine.

401
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:11,670
- He had no right.
<i>-</i> He's the boss, he has the right.

402
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:14,673
No. Why? Because you stood up
to that jerk-off, that's why?

403
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,009
Of course that's why.
The bunch of hoodlums

404
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,303
- living their lives like criminals.
<i>-</i> Enough.

405
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,847
<i>- Enough, both of you.
- No, that's not enough!</i>

406
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:23,348
You've been there 10 years and what?

407
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:24,933
He's just gonna say,
"That's it, no more"?

408
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,727
- Mm-hmm.
<i>-</i> That's exactly what they're gonna say.

409
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,478
And they can and they did.

410
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:31,440
And that's all.

411
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:38,071
10 years my father's
working for these people.

412
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,032
And what has he got
to show for it? Nothing.

413
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:41,658
No retirement, no insurance.

414
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:44,202
You know what?
I worry about that stuff, you know?

415
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:46,747
Yeah well,
we all worry about that, kid.

416
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:49,458
What are you gonna do?
Come on, let's get to work.

417
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,383
Oh, your date was good?

418
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,552
It's the circus.
What are you gonna do?

419
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:06,141
Giana loved it.
There were clowns and things.

420
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:08,644
You know, they had a unicorn
and some craziness.

421
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,354
<i>- You know?
- Oh yeah?</i>

422
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,356
Hey, so what's the deal at Empire?

423
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:14,691
You know,
far as insurance or retirement?

424
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:18,236
Again with the retirement? You're
too young to worry about retirement.

425
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,614
Especially with those hoodlums,
believe me.

426
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:22,532
Ahh, you keep saying that.
What's the deal?

427
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,910
They're crooked, right?
Huh, always in that room?

428
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:27,871
Yeah. They ain't playing
Tiddlywinks in there, pal.

429
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:29,790
You just wait out here, okay?

430
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:32,042
You're like that cartoon thing--
you worry too much.

431
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,836
Hey, guys, how you doing?

432
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:48,725
Trust me, from here out
you'll be doing the heavy lifting,

433
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:51,103
I guarantee you that.
They don't pay me enough to do--

434
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:55,774
Get your hands up!

435
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,693
It's okay, whoa whoa whoa.

436
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:00,570
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

437
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,447
Shut the fuck up!

438
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:04,408
Come on, come here,
you motherfucker!

439
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:07,953
<i>-</i> Motherfucker, motherfucker!
- I'll kill you, no!

440
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,871
Get the fuck--

441
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,251
No no, hey!

442
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,462
No!

443
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:19,256
Yo yo, hey!

444
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:24,428
Marie...

445
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,472
Get the fuck outta here.
Let's go!

446
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:29,975
Fuck the money!

447
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:34,771
Let's get the fuck outta here.

448
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,654
Kid's lucky
he was wearing a vest.

449
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:44,489
If not, game over.

450
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:47,325
<i>- No doubt.
- The kid's named Potami or something.</i>

451
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:49,703
He's right over there.

452
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:54,416
I'm gonna go talk to him.

453
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:06,470
Mr. "Potami."

454
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,722
I'm Jerry Ransone, cop...

455
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:10,849
detective, you know.

456
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:14,144
Is he dead?

457
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:21,651
Yeah. High probability.

458
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:24,529
Listen, Mr. Potami--

459
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:27,866
hey hey. Whoa whoa.

460
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,534
Easy,okay?

461
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:32,871
Listen, if you had anything to do

462
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:35,624
with this whole whatever-just-
went-down-- listen to me,

463
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,794
now's a better time than later
if you want to shoot straight with me.

464
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,796
I'm giving you a chance.

465
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:44,216
Sound fair to you?

466
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:46,176
Listen, I'm not gonna
waste your time,

467
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:48,178
I don't want you to waste my time.
I got a life too.

468
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:50,639
<i>-</i> I got a lot of shit to do, okay?
- I already told the other cops.

469
00:23:50,806 --> 00:23:52,808
Okay? I had nothing
to do with this.

470
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:56,311
He's a good guy.
I liked him. He had a family.

471
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:00,982
Fucking break already, okay?

472
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,155
It's all right.
The kid's clean.

473
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:10,575
What?

474
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:13,078
He's clean.
The kid's clean. Let him go.

475
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,596
All right, I'm gonna go.
My motherjust wanted me

476
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:33,557
to stop by,
make sure you were alive.

477
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:35,851
<i>-</i> You should stay.
- I'm still here.

478
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:37,519
You Okay?

479
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:39,187
Yeah, I-- you know.

480
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:42,107
Feels like I got kicked
in the ribs or something.

481
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:43,942
Yeah, except it was a gun.

482
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:46,278
Yeah, thank God
for that gun-protector thing.

483
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:47,863
All right, I'm gonna go.

484
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:50,240
- No, don't.
<i>-</i> Don't you want to eat?

485
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:53,160
<i>-</i> Sit down, eat something.
- I've gotta go to work.

486
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:55,787
I'll see you guys later.
Glad you're okay, Chris.

487
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:58,331
<i>- Thanks, Nance.
- Good night.</i>

488
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:01,585
<i>- She's a good girl.
- Yeah.</i>

489
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:04,296
- Very nice girl. I like her.
<i>-</i> Like a sister that I like.

490
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:05,797
<i>-</i> Shut up.
- Hey.

491
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:07,757
The main thing is
that you're safe, thank God.

492
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:09,676
<i>-</i> That's the main thing.
- And your partner?

493
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:11,761
The job will take care
for his family?

494
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:15,473
- That's what they said.
<i>-</i> Then that's what they'll do, right?

495
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,517
That's what they said.

496
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,144
Good.

497
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:20,770
Oh hey!

498
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,147
Fucking-a, malaka.

499
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:24,149
I thought your dad was
the man of steel, right?

500
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:26,401
- With the mouth.
<i>-</i> Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse my language.

501
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:28,153
What happened?
I mean a fucking bomb?!

502
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,655
<i>- His friend was just killed, Eddie.
- I know, that sucks.</i>

503
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:33,366
- Are you kidding? I mean--
<i>-</i> None of this would have happened

504
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,994
if it wasn't for that thing
with you smoking pot and all that.

505
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:37,662
<i>-</i> In the Led Zeppelin show.
- No, I know.

506
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:40,165
<i>-</i> Chris would be a police officer now.
- I know, I feel terrible.

507
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:42,167
Yeah, you're talking about
Black Sabbath, by the way.

508
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:44,085
Trust me,
I wish we saw Zeppelin.

509
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:48,173
What the fuck happened, bro?

510
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,425
- Oop.
<i>-</i> I'm gonna go.

511
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,677
<i>- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go lay down or something.</i>

512
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:55,680
Going to lay down?
Why would everybody--

513
00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:58,016
everybody leaves when I show up?

514
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:02,771
Yo, what channel's cable?

515
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:07,692
A botched attempt
at an armored-car robbery

516
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:10,028
left one man dead
and a slew of questions,

517
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:12,447
as a pipe bomb was detonated
in broad daylight

518
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:15,033
at 125th and Lennox Avenue
in Manhattan.

519
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,744
Police are investigating
the robbery as two suspects,

520
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:19,746
both wearing masks, fled the scene

521
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:22,040
in what's being described
as a blue van.

522
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:00,287
Potamis!

523
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,755
- Yeah?
- So you'll be working nights here now.

524
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:12,549
What? Why?

525
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,634
We give our guys
on the streets guns

526
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,012
to shoot people
who show up with other guns.

527
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:20,056
I had Tony's back, okay?

528
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:23,310
Great. So you'll be
working nights now.

529
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:27,439
You can go.

530
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:17,030
There he is.

531
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:19,324
Dirty Harry-

532
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:21,368
Yeah, good job with that.

533
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:24,996
Aren't you supposed to bring
the money inside at night?

534
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:27,540
I don't know, are we?

535
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:30,001
<i>- I'm just asking.
- So are we.</i>

536
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:32,545
The money will be fine out there.

537
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:36,007
Exactly. Just keep an eye
on the monitors and we'll all be fine.

538
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:37,467
Got that?

539
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:39,010
Good.

540
00:28:39,177 --> 00:28:40,678
Let's go.

541
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:43,848
The bosses don't give a shit.
Why should we?

542
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:45,892
Exactly. Fuck that.
I got kids at home.

543
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:30,330
The fuckers are giving
Tony's wife 5,000

544
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:32,957
instead of 50. I know
they're stealing it, trust me.

545
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:35,084
- What, the owners are?
<i>-</i> Fuck yeah, the owners.

546
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:36,461
Everybody's up to shit in there.
Everybody.

547
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:38,588
Yeah, everyone except you, bro.

548
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:41,049
Yeah well, the place is a joke.

549
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:43,843
Oh, let's cross. Fucking--
I don't want to deal with those guys.

550
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,346
<i>- Let's cross.
- What, your father working today?</i>

551
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:48,598
<i>-</i> No, he--
- What?

552
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:50,517
- They let him go.
<i>-</i> What?

553
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:52,352
After 10 years
they fucking let him go.

554
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,812
<i>- Fucking assholes.
- That's it, no more. Fucking--</i>

555
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:57,065
Thinking they're big shits
in their Cadillacs, right?

556
00:30:57,232 --> 00:30:58,900
<i>-</i> Fucking big shots.
- Excuse me?

557
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,861
I'm just saying you fire this guy's
fucking father after 10 years?

558
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:03,613
Sorry, I'm not sure
I'm hearing you right.

559
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,989
I think the least
you could do is be a little loyal.

560
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:06,157
Let's go.

561
00:31:06,324 --> 00:31:08,535
<i>-</i> I don't know what you're saying.
- Fucking big shots

562
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:10,078
in their Cadillacs, right?
Big shit.

563
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:13,081
<i>- I take the trains, yo.
- Asshole.</i>

564
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:22,549
You know what? You should rob
that place where you work.

565
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:25,843
You say the place
ain't got no security, so.

566
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,512
Yeah, you're right. I should.

567
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,181
Yeah, I am right! What,
you don't think they'll screw it over?

568
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:32,350
They screwed your friend over.
Look at him.

569
00:31:32,517 --> 00:31:34,394
Fucking widow.

570
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:37,313
Think about that.
Think about his kids, bro.

571
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,732
Yeah, I should rob them.

572
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:41,693
Yeah, you should.

573
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:48,408
We'll fix them, right? Yeah.

574
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:57,625
Fuck.

575
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:03,149
Shit.

576
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:21,125
This is Chris. Code 18249.

577
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:23,961
Yo, this is Honeywell.
Got a reading the gate's open there?

578
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,382
Yeah, I don't know. The--

579
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:30,009
the light was blinking,
but it looks good now.

580
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:32,512
All right. Cops say we get
a signal, we've gotta call.

581
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:34,514
No worries.
Call if there's a problem.

582
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:35,890
- Okay.
- All right.

583
00:34:37,577 --> 00:34:39,203
All right, bro, just let me--

584
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,330
<i>- show it to me one more time.
- Just keep your fucking voice down.</i>

585
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:43,166
<i>- Let me see one more.
- Cut the shit, all right?</i>

586
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:45,251
Holy shit!
And they won't know?

587
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:46,878
They don't even
count it half the time.

588
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:48,463
Jesus, holy shit.

589
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:51,924
The camera doesn't even see the door
when it opens. The place is a joke.

590
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:53,509
Like I even want to fucking take it.
- You know, fuck it, right?

591
00:34:53,676 --> 00:34:55,720
Do you understand?
You gotta get me a job at this place.

592
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:57,680
Do you know what I could
do with $25,000?

593
00:34:57,847 --> 00:34:59,640
I could pay for my fucking wedding,
my fucking car.

594
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:01,893
Shh, keep your fucking mouth down.
Calm down, okay?

595
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:03,728
Trust me,
I did this for a reason.

596
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:06,063
<i>- Yeah, to take the money!
- No, it's just fucked up,</i>

597
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,524
what they did to Tony's family.
The guy had a fucking wife,

598
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:11,277
- a little girl.
<i>-</i> Yeah listen, I feel terrible too,

599
00:35:11,444 --> 00:35:13,905
but you know what?
Can we go out and party already?

600
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,077
<i>- All right, yeah. Fuck it.
- Thank you. Jesus.</i>

601
00:35:20,244 --> 00:35:23,122
<i>- Have a bit of fun every once--
- I gotta make one stop before we go.</i>

602
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:26,667
Hey, let's go.
Get your fucking eye--

603
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:28,085
- Why?
<i>-</i> Let's fucking go!

604
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:29,587
Why, you leaving $100?

605
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:40,348
Why are you stopping?

606
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:48,231
I don't wanna be a dick, but really?

607
00:35:49,732 --> 00:35:51,150
Really.

608
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:13,881
<i>-</i> Mrs. Cappolitti?
- Yes.

609
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:16,968
I, uh--

610
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:18,928
I was a good friend of Tony's.

611
00:36:20,263 --> 00:36:22,139
I wanted to give this to you.

612
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:24,267
<i>- Excuse me?
- Please just take it.</i>

613
00:36:25,977 --> 00:36:27,687
I'm really sorry.

614
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:45,830
We, uh, good to go now?

615
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,666
Yeah, let's do it.

616
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:01,304
All right!

617
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,639
In my dreams...

618
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:06,767
This place reeks of Aqua Net.

619
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:08,019
Ugh.

620
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:12,189
Hey, right here.
This is our spot right here.

621
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:14,400
- All right.
<i>-</i> Can we get four kamikazes

622
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:16,861
and a bottle of your most
expensive champagne, all right?

623
00:37:17,028 --> 00:37:19,530
<i>-</i> And a round of Long Island ice teas.
- I want a white Russian, Eddie.

624
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:22,158
<i>-</i> A white Russian for the beauty queen.
- Everyone should chill tonight.

625
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:23,409
<i>- Just chill.
- Just do it!</i>

626
00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:25,036
And where the fuck
did you get all this money?

627
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:27,538
<i>-</i> Chris stole it from the money place.
- Hmm?

628
00:37:27,705 --> 00:37:30,166
Relax, bro. Everybody knows
I'm just fucking around.

629
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,251
Come on, who thinks
you stole from where you work?

630
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:33,586
<i>-</i> Shit, I need smokes.
- Right?

631
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:35,129
<i>- Let's go to the bar.
- Where are you going?</i>

632
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:37,298
<i>- I'm going to get cigarettes.
- Get me some, all right?</i>

633
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:39,759
<i>-</i> Fuck you, Eddie, get your own.
- You smoke all my cigarettes.

634
00:37:39,926 --> 00:37:41,469
Fuck off.

635
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:45,389
Yo, this place is the shit
when you got cash, right?

636
00:37:45,556 --> 00:37:48,559
You know, you really gotta learn to keep
your mouth shut, you know that?

637
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:52,772
<i>-</i> It is a lot of cash though, right?
- Fuck yeah, it is!

638
00:37:52,939 --> 00:37:54,565
<i>-</i> A lot of fucking cash.
- Fuck yeah, it is.

639
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:58,069
Yo, look who it is, bro.
Mike and Jimmy, look at them.

640
00:37:58,235 --> 00:38:01,197
Yeah, big shots in the bullshit room
thinking who they are, right?

641
00:38:01,364 --> 00:38:02,865
<i>- Couple of jerk-offs.
- Who are they with?</i>

642
00:38:03,032 --> 00:38:05,242
Puerto Ricans from Jackson Heights.
Thank you, sweetheart.

643
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,578
<i>- I know what that is, right?
- Puerto Ricans, huh?</i>

644
00:38:07,745 --> 00:38:09,872
Coke.
Gonna say what's up.

645
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:11,916
Yo, where are you going?

646
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:13,626
Where are you going?

647
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:15,753
- Yo, it's VIP only.
- Yeah, exactly.

648
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,672
Whatever you guys need too,
just talk to me, Jimmy.

649
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:19,131
<i>- We'll take care of you.
- Ho ho!</i>

650
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:20,883
Big shit, nice!

651
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:23,386
You can see the whole
fucking room from this place.

652
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:25,513
- Look, I can see Chris!
<i>-</i> What the fuck you doing here, Eddie?

653
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,765
What, I'm just here, bro.
I'm just hanging out.

654
00:38:27,932 --> 00:38:30,059
¢'.Qué pasa, amigo?
H°W are YOU guys doing?

655
00:38:30,226 --> 00:38:31,978
- Okay?
<i>-</i> We were discussing business,

656
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:34,772
<i>- uh, you know. So can you go, please?
- Yeah yeah yeah, what?</i>

657
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:36,232
What?
I'm not a businessman?

658
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:38,609
I don't look
like I can conduct business myself?

659
00:38:38,776 --> 00:38:41,320
What?
I'm all business, bro.

660
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:42,738
That's what I am.
I'm here to party.

661
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:44,365
Are you guys here to party,
you know what I mean?

662
00:38:44,532 --> 00:38:46,075
I got the champagne,
you guys got the coke.

663
00:38:46,242 --> 00:38:48,119
Come on, let's make a deal.
What do you want me to do?

664
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:51,247
Right? These are the guys you were
telling me about at the diner.

665
00:38:51,414 --> 00:38:53,249
<i>-</i> The Puerto Ricans, right?
- Colombians.

666
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:55,042
- Who?
- Syrians.

667
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:57,294
You fucking have
a funny guy here, huh?

668
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:01,173
Who?
What'd you say?

669
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,468
I said you think you're
the funny guy here, huh?

670
00:39:04,635 --> 00:39:06,178
All my--
I'm the funny guy?

671
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:08,764
I'm sorry, bro. I can't understand
a fucking word you're saying.

672
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:10,808
Holy shit.
Yo, you actually talk like that?

673
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:12,518
<i>- Like for real?
- Eddie, Eddie, come here.</i>

674
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:14,311
<i>- Somebody tell me who this idiot is.
- Shut up, come here.</i>

675
00:39:14,478 --> 00:39:16,731
- I like this funny guy.
- Thank you.

676
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:18,274
Eddie! Come here.

677
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:19,984
<i>- What?
- C'mere, here.</i>

678
00:39:20,151 --> 00:39:22,069
<i>- You can pay me later.
- Oh, come on!</i>

679
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:24,196
I'm not that kind of--
who do you think I am?

680
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:25,614
Come on, bro.
This guy.

681
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:27,366
He thinks he can fucking
just pay me off.

682
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:28,993
<i>-</i> You want the champagne?
- Just go.

683
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,828
Here.
Enjoy that, guys, all right?

684
00:39:30,995 --> 00:39:31,996
<i>-</i> Thank you.
- All right,

685
00:39:32,163 --> 00:39:33,664
I'm gonna go take care of this.
You know what I mean?

686
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:34,832
<i>-</i> I'll be right back.
- Yep.

687
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:37,418
Fucking room--
fancy shit, wow.

688
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:42,298
<i>- The guy's an idiot, you know?
- Retarded.</i>

689
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:45,176
Since when do these jerk-offs
have so much money?

690
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:48,220
I was just thinking
the same exact shit.

691
00:39:49,722 --> 00:39:51,390
Chateau de Shit.

692
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:53,601
Asshole blows enough lines,
he'll be talking all night.

693
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:54,769
All right!

694
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:04,653
There's like $25,000 in each bag.

695
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,239
And each bag is locked
behind this fucking gate.

696
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:09,033
The camera doesn't even look,

697
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,327
and he's the only fucking security guy
in the whole place at night.

698
00:40:11,494 --> 00:40:13,162
Uh, yeah.

699
00:40:15,164 --> 00:40:16,874
<i>-</i> Where the fuck were you?
- Chris.

700
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:20,669
You know, Eddie was just
telling us about the 25Gs.

701
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:23,089
That true you're
the only guy there at night?

702
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:25,049
We were just talking, bro.

703
00:40:25,216 --> 00:40:27,885
Yeah, so, you know,
I'm just curious,

704
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:31,180
you know, how can-- how can you take
that much and they don't know nothing?

705
00:40:31,347 --> 00:40:32,973
- Hmm?
<i>-</i> Tell them how they leave

706
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,266
the truck outside overnight
with the fucking money in it.

707
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:37,561
<i>- Enough, Eddie, okay?
- Tell them that.</i>

708
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:39,438
Whatever you guys
are thinking, forget it.

709
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:41,774
Guys, he doesn't know
what he's talking about.

710
00:40:44,193 --> 00:40:47,738
<i>-</i> Chris, it's-- it's a simple 1-2-3--
- Enough, okay? Enough.

711
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:54,078
Eddie, why would you say
anything to those people?

712
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:56,163
I mean, it's like
you're retarded. Mike--

713
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,040
I mean, he's a maniac,
you know that.

714
00:40:58,207 --> 00:40:59,834
We were just talking, bro, relax.

715
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,044
You already said that.

716
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:03,963
Besides the fact,
they work for Spiro!

717
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,423
Fuck Spiro.
They don't give a shit about Spiro,

718
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,509
nobody does.
You know you didn't tell me

719
00:41:08,676 --> 00:41:10,928
that they leave the truck
outside overnight for no reason.

720
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:13,013
You know you wanted me
to put it in action, bro.

721
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,559
Put what into action?
Listen, you idiot,

722
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:19,186
get whatever stupid idea is
in your head out of your head.

723
00:41:19,353 --> 00:41:21,939
Seriously, let me ask you, what's
the worst that could happen, what?

724
00:41:22,106 --> 00:41:24,984
What did Georgie get that
one time for auto theft, a year?

725
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:27,278
And a year ain't worth
a chance at a million dollars?

726
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:29,446
We're not talking about
robbing a car, Eddie.

727
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:31,740
I'm not cleaning lambjizz
the rest of my life, bro.

728
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:33,951
My father died when he was 42.

729
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:36,328
Your father-- no offense,
but he just got canned

730
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:38,497
<i>-</i> for cleaning Spiro's toilets.
- Watch your mouth.

731
00:41:38,664 --> 00:41:39,665
All right,
I'm sorry. Look,

732
00:41:39,832 --> 00:41:41,876
all I'm saying is think about it, okay?

733
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:44,461
Just think about it when you go
to your house tonight, okay?

734
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:47,631
Worst-case scenario, I go to jail
for robbing a fucking truck,

735
00:41:47,798 --> 00:41:49,967
you know, for a year.

736
00:41:50,134 --> 00:41:51,719
Anything else, we're set.

737
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:54,305
We're set.

738
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:55,973
Fucking think about it.

739
00:41:58,392 --> 00:41:59,810
We're set, bro.

740
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:59,912
Hamilton Bohannon, 1978.

741
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,498
Have a great night, New York.

742
00:43:02,665 --> 00:43:04,083
Look at you, buddy.

743
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:08,003
Sitting in there with $25 million.

744
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:13,133
That's a lot of money.

745
00:43:44,206 --> 00:43:47,376
Okay, Eddie, the diner, tonight.

746
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:54,091
Look, Chris, I just gotta know that
this asshole can keep his mouth shut.

747
00:43:54,258 --> 00:43:56,093
Okay?
If Spiro finds out, we're dead,

748
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,095
<i>- me and Jimmy.
- Why, you don't trust me?</i>

749
00:43:58,262 --> 00:43:59,513
No!

750
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,515
Listen, no more bullshitting, okay?

751
00:44:01,682 --> 00:44:03,434
This is serious.
And Mike's right.

752
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,936
Nobody but us knows anything
about anything, okay?

753
00:44:12,109 --> 00:44:13,777
What's his problem?

754
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:19,241
I just-- I just think

755
00:44:19,408 --> 00:44:22,161
if we're going to do this,
we should let Spiro in on it, no?

756
00:44:22,328 --> 00:44:24,371
You tell Spiro, he'll want it all.

757
00:44:24,538 --> 00:44:26,790
Yeah, but we don't have
to give it to him all.

758
00:44:26,957 --> 00:44:28,417
See what I'm saying?

759
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,086
Eddie's right.

760
00:44:31,253 --> 00:44:33,088
He's trélos, but he's right.

761
00:44:33,255 --> 00:44:34,965
Spiro can't know nothing.

762
00:44:35,132 --> 00:44:37,718
What, you don't think
he's gonna find out?

763
00:44:37,885 --> 00:44:38,927
No, I don't.

764
00:44:40,137 --> 00:44:41,305
Okay.

765
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:44,391
Okay, Jimmy.

766
00:44:44,558 --> 00:44:47,227
I'm serious.
We're serious.

767
00:44:48,312 --> 00:44:50,147
Are you good with that?

768
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:53,984
Hey.

769
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:56,320
He's asking you a question.

770
00:44:59,573 --> 00:45:01,033
Eh, I'm out.

771
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,618
- Fuck it.
<i>-</i> You're out.

772
00:45:02,785 --> 00:45:05,120
You don't need me for this.
You got two guys anyway.

773
00:45:05,287 --> 00:45:08,082
I was going to do construction
at the movie theater this weekend.

774
00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:10,501
All right?
I'm gonna go.

775
00:45:17,508 --> 00:45:20,052
Look, I'm still in
for the Colombian deal.

776
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:21,762
All right?
However that goes down,

777
00:45:21,929 --> 00:45:23,138
but this...

778
00:45:23,305 --> 00:45:25,099
it's-- no.

779
00:45:25,265 --> 00:45:26,683
No, I'm gonna go.

780
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,143
<i>- You sure?
- Yeah.</i>

781
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,314
Fuck him.
More money for me then, right?

782
00:45:33,399 --> 00:45:34,983
Okay.

783
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,527
Don't worry, all right, Chris?

784
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:38,946
Don't worry.
He knows I'd kill him.

785
00:45:39,988 --> 00:45:40,989
We're good.

786
00:45:41,156 --> 00:45:42,908
Right.

787
00:45:44,576 --> 00:45:46,078
Okay okay.

788
00:45:49,873 --> 00:45:52,084
Okay, this...

789
00:45:52,251 --> 00:45:53,752
is Empire.

790
00:46:04,513 --> 00:46:07,391
Okay, Thursday night
I'll be the only one there.

791
00:46:09,726 --> 00:46:12,062
Eddie, off Boston Road
there'll be a fence.

792
00:46:13,564 --> 00:46:15,232
At the top of the fence,
there'll be a camera.

793
00:46:16,233 --> 00:46:17,359
I want you to break it.

794
00:46:20,237 --> 00:46:21,947
The next night-- Friday night--

795
00:46:22,114 --> 00:46:24,616
<i>-</i> the guards will be out by 8:00.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

796
00:46:26,702 --> 00:46:29,580
Nobody gets overtime, so believe me,
they'll be out like clockwork.

797
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,043
8:00 sharp.

798
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:38,005
There's a phone booth
two blocks away on Jerome Avenue.

799
00:46:38,172 --> 00:46:40,424
You and Mike will go there
and you'll wait.

800
00:46:42,426 --> 00:46:44,845
I'll go inside,
so I'll make sure everything's cool.

801
00:46:45,012 --> 00:46:47,806
But I'm serious,
you stay out there and you'll wait.

802
00:46:49,475 --> 00:46:52,186
And nothing happens until I call you.

803
00:46:54,271 --> 00:46:56,523
Nothing... until I call.

804
00:47:02,905 --> 00:47:03,906
Hey, whoa whoa whoa, hey!

805
00:47:04,072 --> 00:47:07,117
He's okay, he's okay, he's okay,
he's okay. Anyone else here?

806
00:47:08,285 --> 00:47:10,370
<i>-</i> Is anyone here?!
- What? No.

807
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:14,500
- All right.
<i>-</i> What's going on?

808
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:17,794
We got a tip a crew's coming in here.
You know anything about it?

809
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:19,588
<i>-</i> Do you know anything about it?
- No no.

810
00:47:19,755 --> 00:47:22,382
All right, get up on the roof.
Staircase's right there.

811
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:24,760
Secure that door.
Check the perimeter.

812
00:47:32,267 --> 00:47:33,977
Everyone, move!

813
00:47:44,363 --> 00:47:46,949
I've been upstairs,
downstairs, all over the place.

814
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:48,367
Nothing in here.

815
00:47:48,534 --> 00:47:50,327
Camera look like it's out of order,

816
00:47:50,494 --> 00:47:52,246
but hey,
what you gonna do, huh?

817
00:47:53,497 --> 00:47:55,749
Other than that,
not a mice stirring.

818
00:47:57,834 --> 00:48:00,587
Do you have any idea how many
violations are going on in this place?

819
00:48:00,754 --> 00:48:01,838
- It's crazy.
<i>-</i> Yeah yeah,

820
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:03,507
it's about as secure
as a candy shop.

821
00:48:03,674 --> 00:48:06,635
- Hey, it's only money, right?
<i>-</i> Yeah, exactly.

822
00:48:08,387 --> 00:48:11,181
All right, I'll take one
last look around the premises.

823
00:48:11,348 --> 00:48:13,225
<i>-</i> Just holler.
- For sure.

824
00:48:15,477 --> 00:48:17,729
Mind if I do a few sets
on your thing over there?

825
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:20,274
You know,
knock yourself out.

826
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:22,901
'Cause it's Nautilus by the gym

827
00:48:23,068 --> 00:48:24,820
over by my place.

828
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,447
You know what they say?

829
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:29,199
Dead weight,
that's the only way

830
00:48:29,366 --> 00:48:31,368
to really get
that size on, you know?

831
00:48:31,535 --> 00:48:33,078
Gotta feel that burn.

832
00:48:33,245 --> 00:48:35,414
<i>- Yeah.
- Little hard work,</i>

833
00:48:35,581 --> 00:48:36,873
no big shirts.

834
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,667
You know how it is.

835
00:48:47,551 --> 00:48:49,011
Yo?

836
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:50,178
The fucking cops are here,
you hear me?

837
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:51,888
- Are you fucking kidding me?
<i>-</i> Fucking cops--

838
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:53,890
<i>-</i> they're already inside and I fucking--
- Yo!

839
00:48:55,434 --> 00:48:58,562
Hey hey hey,
what was that there?

840
00:49:04,276 --> 00:49:05,736
- That?
<i>-</i> Yeah, what was that?

841
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:08,238
Naw, I was just, uh--

842
00:49:08,405 --> 00:49:10,532
you know,
I was talking to my mother.

843
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:12,367
<i>- That was your mother?
- No, she was--</i>

844
00:49:12,534 --> 00:49:14,286
I don't know, she was doing
some cooking or something.

845
00:49:14,453 --> 00:49:16,705
<i>-</i> I'm gonna go use the bathroom, okay?
- Yeah, it's right down there.

846
00:49:16,872 --> 00:49:17,873
You sure you don't
want to call her back?

847
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,166
No no, that's okay.

848
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:20,834
That's what I'm talking about.

849
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:23,420
I think we got
something out here, boss.

850
00:49:23,587 --> 00:49:24,880
Roger that.
On the move.

851
00:49:25,047 --> 00:49:26,673
Let's roll.
Enough with the weights.

852
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,384
<i>- Everyone move!
- Let's go. Move!</i>

853
00:49:29,551 --> 00:49:31,386
Fuck.

854
00:49:31,553 --> 00:49:33,805
How are things going out there?
Come on, talk to me.

855
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:36,433
Two perps,
both armed, masks on.

856
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,894
<i>- One just slipped the fence.
- Anyone else?</i>

857
00:49:39,061 --> 00:49:40,812
Negative.

858
00:49:40,979 --> 00:49:42,606
Roger that.

859
00:49:42,773 --> 00:49:44,441
<i>- You ready?
- Ready.</i>

860
00:49:46,485 --> 00:49:47,527
You stay.

861
00:49:49,237 --> 00:49:50,781
<i>-</i> You ready?
- I'm ready.

862
00:49:52,658 --> 00:49:53,742
Let's do this.

863
00:49:53,909 --> 00:49:56,536
Freeze! I said freeze,
drop your weapons!

864
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,794
Ah shit, get back.
Stay down, stay down. Don't move.

865
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,380
Johnson, call for backup.
Call for backup.

866
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:08,507
There's shots fired down here!

867
00:50:08,674 --> 00:50:10,258
<i>- We need backup!
- What do you see, Ronny?</i>

868
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:12,135
Talk to me, buddy.
Talk to me.

869
00:50:12,302 --> 00:50:13,887
The bald perp's behind the trucks.

870
00:50:14,054 --> 00:50:16,056
No eyes on him.
If they move, I got 'em.

871
00:50:16,223 --> 00:50:18,600
Okay, you see anything,
you talk to me, you got it?

872
00:50:18,767 --> 00:50:20,769
Roger that.

873
00:50:22,521 --> 00:50:25,023
<i>-</i> Johnson, get to the back.
- Roger. I got it.

874
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,358
Stay here, don't move.
You hear?

875
00:50:26,525 --> 00:50:28,318
<i>- What are you--
- Don't move, stay there!</i>

876
00:50:28,485 --> 00:50:30,570
Any visuals, Ronny?

877
00:50:30,737 --> 00:50:32,280
Huh-uh, nothing yet.

878
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:34,741
Dispatch,
we've got guns fired here.

879
00:50:34,908 --> 00:50:37,536
We're gonna need backup at Empire.
Situation just got real.

880
00:50:37,703 --> 00:50:40,664
10-71, code two Jerome Avenue.

881
00:50:40,831 --> 00:50:43,500
<i>- Yeah.
- We need backup! We need backup here!</i>

882
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:46,211
Got eyes on one.

883
00:50:46,378 --> 00:50:48,171
By the gate, by the gate!

884
00:50:50,716 --> 00:50:52,843
No hits, sir.
One's still behind the truck.

885
00:50:53,009 --> 00:50:54,553
Roger. Stay the course.

886
00:50:56,847 --> 00:50:58,890
Two cars headed over.
On their way.

887
00:50:59,057 --> 00:51:00,475
Roger that.

888
00:51:00,642 --> 00:51:02,477
We've got a real situation here.

889
00:51:02,644 --> 00:51:04,980
Tommy, what's your 10-39?

890
00:51:05,147 --> 00:51:07,524
Turning onto Jerome Avenue now.
Hold tight.

891
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:11,111
Talk to me, boss.
What do you need?

892
00:51:12,863 --> 00:51:14,614
What do you need?
Talk to me, what do you need?

893
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:16,199
Still no visual on the perp, sir.

894
00:51:16,366 --> 00:51:18,034
Still no visual.

895
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:22,372
Boss, I'm getting
no response here.

896
00:51:22,539 --> 00:51:25,584
Lost eyes on the one
behind the truck, sir.

897
00:51:25,751 --> 00:51:27,210
He's definitely armed.

898
00:51:29,713 --> 00:51:32,591
Ronny, talk to me.
Do you have eyes on the situation?

899
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:36,261
Backup, we're gonna
need some backup here!

900
00:51:37,721 --> 00:51:39,598
Somebody's gotta give me
something out there.

901
00:51:39,765 --> 00:51:41,391
Talk to me! Talk to me!

902
00:51:41,558 --> 00:51:43,393
What do you
need me to do, boss?

903
00:51:44,728 --> 00:51:46,730
Shots fired, shots fired.

904
00:51:46,897 --> 00:51:50,150
Backup, we need backup,
we need backup!

905
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:53,236
Shots fired, shots fired!

906
00:51:53,403 --> 00:51:55,989
Shots fired, we need backup!

907
00:51:56,156 --> 00:51:59,075
We need backup! We've got officers
engaged in gunfire here.

908
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:01,119
What's the ETA?

909
00:52:01,286 --> 00:52:03,038
Coming into Empire now.

910
00:52:03,205 --> 00:52:05,248
Boss, what's
the situation out there?

911
00:52:05,415 --> 00:52:08,418
<i>- We've got cars arriving.
- All clear, everything's all clear.</i>

912
00:52:08,585 --> 00:52:10,879
10-26 all clear.

913
00:52:12,339 --> 00:52:14,090
Backup arriving
on the scene right now.

914
00:52:14,257 --> 00:52:16,092
Roger that.

915
00:52:17,761 --> 00:52:19,679
Move!

916
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,566
What the fuck was that about?

917
00:52:31,733 --> 00:52:34,277
It's about somebody with a big fucking
mouth I'm gonna have to shut.

918
00:52:34,444 --> 00:52:37,072
<i>- F-- there he is.
- It could have been a coincidence.</i>

919
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:39,032
Ain't no such thing
as a coincidence, Eddie.

920
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:44,663
Mike, what the fuck
you doing here?

921
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:46,414
<i>- What's up, Jimmy?
- Mike, wait--</i>

922
00:52:48,124 --> 00:52:50,210
Want to rat me out,
you fucking scumbag?

923
00:52:52,379 --> 00:52:54,464
- Mike, I didn't--
- Fucking do it.

924
00:52:54,631 --> 00:52:56,466
Get up.
We ain't calling quits

925
00:52:56,633 --> 00:52:58,885
on that Empire place neither, okay?
Get the fuck in!

926
00:53:17,821 --> 00:53:20,073
Yeah, he shot the guy.
He's a hero.

927
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,826
He saved the cop's life.
He could've died.

928
00:53:22,993 --> 00:53:25,412
MY 5°", my son...

929
00:53:26,705 --> 00:53:28,665
There he is, there he is!

930
00:53:28,832 --> 00:53:30,709
My hero.

931
00:53:30,876 --> 00:53:31,960
<i>-</i> Say hello.

932
00:53:32,127 --> 00:53:33,169
I'm gonna go talk
to Eddie for a minute.

933
00:53:33,336 --> 00:53:34,796
- Eddie.
<i>-</i> I'll come back, I'll come back.

934
00:53:38,466 --> 00:53:40,802
Oh, now he's a hero
he has no time for his mother.

935
00:53:40,969 --> 00:53:43,221
Where you been?
I was calling you all morning.

936
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:45,015
Where was I?
Where the fuck were you?

937
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:48,018
How crazy was that shit last night?

938
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:50,353
Another crew comes to do
the same fucking shit?

939
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:55,442
What? What's up with you?
Where were you?

940
00:53:55,609 --> 00:53:58,153
Well, Mike killed Jimmy
last night.

941
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,529
That's where I was.

942
00:53:59,696 --> 00:54:01,531
<i>- What?
- Yeah.</i>

943
00:54:01,698 --> 00:54:04,784
Thought he ratted us out, now he wants
to go back in and rob Empire again.

944
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:07,037
<i>- What, are you fucking crazy?
- It's not me, it's him!</i>

945
00:54:07,203 --> 00:54:09,414
Jimmy had nothing to do
with what went down last night, okay?

946
00:54:09,581 --> 00:54:11,458
<i>-</i> It was a fucking coincidence.
- I know. You know what?

947
00:54:11,625 --> 00:54:13,418
It's too late.
Killed him, so.

948
00:54:13,585 --> 00:54:16,254
What the fuck's Spiro gonna do when
he finds out about this?

949
00:54:16,421 --> 00:54:18,381
You know he's gonna
fucking kill us, right?

950
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:20,717
That's why I say
we gotta go back in there

951
00:54:20,884 --> 00:54:22,427
and take the money
for ourselves before Mike,

952
00:54:22,594 --> 00:54:24,095
<i>- before him, before anybody else does.
- What?</i>

953
00:54:24,262 --> 00:54:25,722
Are you fucking crazy?

954
00:54:25,889 --> 00:54:27,515
- No.
<i>-</i> They're not gonna leave the money

955
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:29,809
<i>-</i> on the street any more anyway, okay?
- So we go inside and get it!

956
00:54:29,976 --> 00:54:31,686
Just fucking forget it.
Forget everything.

957
00:54:31,853 --> 00:54:33,271
There's cameras
at every door, okay?

958
00:54:33,438 --> 00:54:35,398
So why am I even talking?
I'm not even-- I'm not--

959
00:54:35,565 --> 00:54:37,192
Cops won't expect it.
Nobody will.

960
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,402
Shut your fucking mouth.
Will you please shut your fucking mouth?

961
00:54:39,569 --> 00:54:40,946
<i>-</i> I'm doing it with or without you.
- Oh really?

962
00:54:41,112 --> 00:54:42,530
<i>- You gonna do it without me?
- Yeah yeah, really.</i>

963
00:54:42,697 --> 00:54:44,950
And when I get there, you can call
the cops, you can fucking shoot me

964
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:47,911
or you can say "Fuck yeah, Eddie,
I'm with you." But you know what?

965
00:54:48,078 --> 00:54:49,871
I'm doing it.

966
00:54:50,038 --> 00:54:52,958
And I'm not doing this shit any more,
bro. I'm fucking done with this.

967
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:55,085
- I'm done.
<i>-</i> Watch your mouth, okay?

968
00:54:55,251 --> 00:54:56,920
You watch it.

969
00:54:57,087 --> 00:54:58,755
I'm doing it, Chris.

970
00:54:59,923 --> 00:55:01,549
I know it's just you after 8:00.

971
00:55:11,685 --> 00:55:14,813
...And it was sayonara
New York for sunny California.

972
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:16,773
Albert Hammond in 1972.

973
00:55:19,025 --> 00:55:24,572
Got on board a westbound 747

974
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:29,744
Didn't think before...

975
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:33,498
What to do

976
00:55:34,791 --> 00:55:39,004
Oooh, that talk
of opportunities

977
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:42,799
TV breaks and movies

978
00:55:42,966 --> 00:55:46,469
Rang true

979
00:55:46,636 --> 00:55:49,014
Sure rang true...

980
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:05,530
He's fucking crazy, right?

981
00:56:05,697 --> 00:56:07,574
You know that Chris

982
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:13,496
Fucking crazy,
I'm always fucking crazy.

983
00:56:13,663 --> 00:56:15,248
Well, here I am, right?

984
00:56:15,415 --> 00:56:18,626
- You know how many fucking times--
- Fucking Eddie.

985
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:21,796
Fucking unbelievable.
Say I'm fucking coming, right?

986
00:56:21,963 --> 00:56:23,673
Totally won't split it.

987
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,091
How about that?

988
00:56:25,258 --> 00:56:27,969
Nobody around wants to
fucking believe me, right?

989
00:56:31,514 --> 00:56:33,016
What the fuck?

990
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,150
I told you I was
coming, right? Yeah.

991
00:56:42,317 --> 00:56:43,902
No one ever wants
to believe me, right?

992
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:46,196
Well, here I am, boys. Whoo!

993
00:56:46,362 --> 00:56:48,531
Whoo yeah!

994
00:56:49,657 --> 00:56:51,576
<i>- What the fuck?
- Whoa!</i>

995
00:56:53,661 --> 00:56:55,538
What, are you fucking crazy?!

996
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,874
Well...

997
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,466
I told you
I was fucking coming, bro.

998
00:57:06,633 --> 00:57:08,218
How about that?

999
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:10,220
What'd I tell you, right?

1000
00:57:10,386 --> 00:57:12,222
I told you.

1001
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,476
Where's it at, huh?

1002
00:57:17,685 --> 00:57:18,895
I ain't leaving without it.

1003
00:57:19,062 --> 00:57:20,980
Brother, I'm not leaving
till I get that money.

1004
00:57:21,147 --> 00:57:22,565
I ain't leaving without it, okay?

1005
00:57:22,732 --> 00:57:24,734
Look at you,
you look like a lunatic!

1006
00:57:24,901 --> 00:57:26,694
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

1007
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:28,196
Answer the phone, go ahead.

1008
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:29,948
Answer the--
you answer the phone right now!

1009
00:57:30,115 --> 00:57:32,242
You might as well shoot me
dead right now, okay?

1010
00:57:32,408 --> 00:57:35,203
I'm not going to jail.
I'm not going to jail, bro!

1011
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:37,747
<i>-</i> I am not going to my shitty life--
- Shut up, shut the fuck up!

1012
00:57:37,914 --> 00:57:39,040
<i>- Shut up!
- I'm not going to jail.</i>

1013
00:57:39,207 --> 00:57:41,000
- Shut up, shut up.
<i>-</i> I'm not going to fucking jail.

1014
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:43,378
I'm not going back
to my shitty life right now!

1015
00:57:43,545 --> 00:57:45,922
<i>-</i> Answer the phone, go ahead.
- Shut your mouth. Shut it.

1016
00:57:50,218 --> 00:57:52,262
Yeah, this is Chris. 18249.

1017
00:57:52,428 --> 00:57:54,514
Hey, it's Honeywell.
What's going on over there?

1018
00:57:54,681 --> 00:57:56,933
We got a reading. There's some kind
of a disturbance or what?

1019
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,310
You fucked me.

1020
00:57:59,477 --> 00:58:01,437
We can fucking do this right now.
We can fucking do this.

1021
00:58:01,604 --> 00:58:03,398
Hey, are you out there or what?

1022
00:58:03,565 --> 00:58:05,567
Yo, you want me to call this in?

1023
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:08,111
- Chris, Chris?
<i>-</i> Yeah, it's okay, Duffy.

1024
00:58:08,278 --> 00:58:10,446
My-- my lights on here.
Everything's fine.

1025
00:58:10,613 --> 00:58:12,240
- Fuck!
<i>-</i> All right, go back to sleep.

1026
00:58:12,407 --> 00:58:14,742
<i>-</i> I'll try not to wake you up again.
- Yeah, okay.

1027
00:58:18,621 --> 00:58:20,957
Open this. Come on,
I know you've got the keys.

1028
00:58:21,124 --> 00:58:23,293
Open this right now.
Where's the key right now?

1029
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:25,211
Give me the key, come on.

1030
00:58:26,296 --> 00:58:27,797
Chris, gimme the key!

1031
00:58:29,132 --> 00:58:30,675
<i>- What the fuck am I doing?
- Open it.</i>

1032
00:58:30,842 --> 00:58:32,844
<i>-</i> Open it, open it.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1033
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:35,597
Fuck.

1034
00:58:40,185 --> 00:58:41,978
How do you open this?
Open this right now.

1035
00:58:42,145 --> 00:58:44,314
How do you open it? Open it.

1036
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,149
Come on, open it!

1037
00:58:48,234 --> 00:58:50,486
Come on, open it!

1038
00:58:53,781 --> 00:58:55,825
Un-fucking-believable.

1039
00:58:55,992 --> 00:58:58,870
- Un-fucking-believable.
<i>-</i> Holy shit.

1040
00:59:00,163 --> 00:59:02,332
Put your fucking mask on.

1041
00:59:04,334 --> 00:59:06,044
What the fuck am I doing?

1042
00:59:09,005 --> 00:59:10,590
Fuck shit!

1043
00:59:10,757 --> 00:59:13,176
What the fuck?

1044
00:59:14,219 --> 00:59:15,845
You shot the fucking dog?

1045
00:59:16,012 --> 00:59:18,264
Yeah, thanks for telling me
there was a dog, asshole!

1046
00:59:18,431 --> 00:59:19,474
<i>-</i> Fuck.
- Dick!

1047
00:59:19,641 --> 00:59:21,267
Un-fucking-real.

1048
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,022
What am I gonna fucking
tell people, huh?

1049
00:59:26,189 --> 00:59:28,816
You gonna help me
carry this shit out or what?

1050
00:59:28,983 --> 00:59:30,526
There's a fucking camera, you idiot!

1051
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:32,028
Where?

1052
00:59:35,114 --> 00:59:37,492
Oh, what are you doing?
That's fucking great, Eddie.

1053
00:59:37,659 --> 00:59:39,494
What am I gonna tell people, huh?

1054
00:59:39,661 --> 00:59:41,829
You tell me, what am I gonna
fucking tell people now?

1055
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:44,666
You're on the camera and you're
talking to me, you fucking idiot!

1056
01:00:04,394 --> 01:00:07,897
Damn, we got clowns
in every room here.

1057
01:00:09,983 --> 01:00:11,609
Aww shit.

1058
01:00:11,776 --> 01:00:13,987
Hey, you might want
to go holler at your boy there

1059
01:00:14,153 --> 01:00:16,281
before these FBI clowns
take over from him.

1060
01:00:23,746 --> 01:00:26,416
Looks like your party got
a little out of whack here.

1061
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:29,919
Look at this place, huh?

1062
01:00:30,086 --> 01:00:31,754
God, look at you.

1063
01:00:31,921 --> 01:00:34,340
Yeah, I, uh--
I was on the phone

1064
01:00:34,507 --> 01:00:36,551
- and then--
<i>-</i> You were on the phone?

1065
01:00:36,718 --> 01:00:38,761
You were on that phone
right there?

1066
01:00:39,971 --> 01:00:41,806
<i>- You make a call there?
- No no.</i>

1067
01:00:41,973 --> 01:00:43,766
- I, uh...
<i>-</i> Not that.

1068
01:00:45,184 --> 01:00:47,228
I don't know.
My head's all messed up.

1069
01:00:49,355 --> 01:00:51,190
Three times in a month is crazy.

1070
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:53,443
Man, what are the odds of that, huh?

1071
01:00:53,609 --> 01:00:55,320
Three times.
What are the odds

1072
01:00:55,486 --> 01:00:57,613
that the guy knew exactly
where the keys were too, huh?

1073
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:59,240
Unbelievable.

1074
01:00:59,407 --> 01:01:00,825
The dog passed out from fear.

1075
01:01:00,992 --> 01:01:03,619
9mm must have scared
the shit out of him.

1076
01:01:03,786 --> 01:01:06,289
They found it unconscious.
They thought it was dead.

1077
01:01:06,456 --> 01:01:07,957
They thought the dog was dead.

1078
01:01:08,124 --> 01:01:10,752
- I'm Detective Ransone.
<i>-</i> Yeah, I know who you are.

1079
01:01:10,918 --> 01:01:13,296
Listen, so what have we got here?

1080
01:01:13,463 --> 01:01:16,883
We've got three break-ins
on the same premises,

1081
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:19,844
we've got two men dead,
we've got no arrests.

1082
01:01:20,011 --> 01:01:22,180
Does anybody here
have any idea how many

1083
01:01:22,347 --> 01:01:25,141
dollars that disappeared
from this spot?

1084
01:01:25,308 --> 01:01:26,934
Uh, Detective Ransone

1085
01:01:27,101 --> 01:01:28,644
or Mister--
how do you pronounce it?

1086
01:01:28,811 --> 01:01:30,313
--Patemi, is it?

1087
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,481
Potamitis.

1088
01:01:31,647 --> 01:01:34,817
Yeah.
See, now you know why

1089
01:01:34,984 --> 01:01:36,861
the FBI is rolling up in here.

1090
01:01:37,028 --> 01:01:40,156
Yeah, so.

1091
01:01:40,323 --> 01:01:43,159
Mr. Potamias,
you got Santa Claus

1092
01:01:43,326 --> 01:01:45,328
coming through
your ceiling, right?

1093
01:01:45,495 --> 01:01:46,996
They break in your gate,

1094
01:01:47,163 --> 01:01:49,457
shooting a 9mm
within proximity of your dog

1095
01:01:49,624 --> 01:01:51,626
and you're unconscious.

1096
01:01:51,793 --> 01:01:53,669
Yeah. No, I, uh...

1097
01:01:55,171 --> 01:01:57,131
I don't know. I was making
the rounds. I come back

1098
01:01:57,298 --> 01:01:58,633
and I guess somebody hit me.

1099
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,551
You weren't on the phone?

1100
01:02:00,718 --> 01:02:03,763
No phonecall? Didn't you tell me
you were on that phone?

1101
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:07,600
Honeywell called and you said
everything was okay.

1102
01:02:07,767 --> 01:02:10,311
<i>- Was it okay?
- Yeah, like I said--</i>

1103
01:02:10,478 --> 01:02:12,814
no, I was making the rounds.
I come back and some--

1104
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:14,941
Somebody hit you.

1105
01:02:16,025 --> 01:02:17,360
Yeah.

1106
01:02:17,527 --> 01:02:18,736
Nothing caught your eye?

1107
01:02:18,903 --> 01:02:21,614
Nothing seemed out
of the ordinary at that time?

1108
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:23,408
The camera outside's broke,

1109
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:26,035
so the only visuals I had were
on the money room and the doors.

1110
01:02:26,202 --> 01:02:28,287
Yeah, and somebody's
coming through your ceiling.

1111
01:02:28,454 --> 01:02:30,331
That's a brilliant move.
Whew.

1112
01:02:30,498 --> 01:02:32,834
- Very clever.
<i>-</i> It's really clever.

1113
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,794
Very clever,
very tricky.

1114
01:02:34,961 --> 01:02:36,838
Wow, these guys are
something else, huh?

1115
01:02:37,004 --> 01:02:39,048
<i>- Excuse me, sir.
- So you got anything else for us,</i>

1116
01:02:39,215 --> 01:02:41,050
<i>-</i> Mister...
- Potami.

1117
01:02:41,217 --> 01:02:42,260
Potami?

1118
01:02:42,427 --> 01:02:45,179
Detective Ransone,
any more questions?

1119
01:02:45,346 --> 01:02:47,223
No, I think you guys
covered everything.

1120
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:49,392
No? Good.
So we're done here, right?

1121
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:52,228
Somebody get this kid to a hospital.

1122
01:02:53,938 --> 01:02:55,898
<i>-</i> Unbelievable.
- Mmm.

1123
01:03:19,589 --> 01:03:22,049
Mr. Potamatis,
Ernie Anastos.

1124
01:03:22,216 --> 01:03:24,594
It's been reported that
over $9 million were taken

1125
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,846
in last night's heist.
Do you have anything to say about that?

1126
01:03:27,013 --> 01:03:28,014
No.

1127
01:03:28,181 --> 01:03:29,765
Can I just ask you
a couple of questions?

1128
01:03:29,932 --> 01:03:31,100
Five minutes?

1129
01:03:34,353 --> 01:03:35,938
Keep shooting.
Keep shooting.

1130
01:04:00,087 --> 01:04:01,631
God damn it, Eddie.

1131
01:04:10,806 --> 01:04:11,849
Hey hey-

1132
01:04:12,016 --> 01:04:14,310
- Hey.
<i>-</i> What's going on?

1133
01:04:14,477 --> 01:04:17,146
Nothing, I was--
I need to go for a walk.

1134
01:04:17,313 --> 01:04:19,899
Go for a walk?
Where are you gonna go for a walk, huh?

1135
01:04:21,275 --> 01:04:22,944
Hmm?
Where are you gonna go?

1136
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:25,196
Nowhere.
I'm just going for a walk.

1137
01:04:25,363 --> 01:04:28,491
Where you gonna go? The police
are out there looking for you.

1138
01:04:28,658 --> 01:04:31,077
<i>-</i> You okay?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

1139
01:04:31,244 --> 01:04:33,204
<i>- I just-- I'm sorry.
- What's going on?</i>

1140
01:04:33,371 --> 01:04:36,040
- I gotta go for a walk.
<i>-</i> What's going on? What's going on?

1141
01:04:36,207 --> 01:04:37,833
- Nothing. I'm fine.
<i>-</i> You're not fine.

1142
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,503
You're not fine.
Come on.

1143
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:43,714
You were out all night. The police are
here all day looking for you.

1144
01:04:43,881 --> 01:04:46,008
Your face--
come on, tell me.

1145
01:04:46,175 --> 01:04:47,385
Tell me, tell me.

1146
01:04:47,552 --> 01:04:49,095
- Talk to me.
- Nothing. No, I--

1147
01:04:49,262 --> 01:04:51,180
<i>-</i> I'm gonna go for a walk.
- No.

1148
01:04:51,347 --> 01:04:53,266
<i>-</i> I'm gonna come back. I'm okay.
- You're not okay. Listen--

1149
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:55,017
- You're not okay.
- I'm okay, Pop. I'm all right.

1150
01:04:55,184 --> 01:04:56,644
Don't walk away! Listen to me.
I'm talking to you. Chris!

1151
01:04:56,811 --> 01:04:58,521
<i>-</i> Chris, listen to me!
- I'm sorry.

1152
01:04:58,688 --> 01:05:00,439
If goddamn Eddie has
something to do with this

1153
01:05:00,606 --> 01:05:03,067
to make the police come for you again,
I'm gonna kill him, you hear me?

1154
01:05:03,234 --> 01:05:05,236
Listen to me!

1155
01:05:14,412 --> 01:05:16,914
U.S. District Attorney Giuliani,
welcome.

1156
01:05:17,081 --> 01:05:19,208
<i>- Agents Nugent, Marichal.
- Hey, how you doing?</i>

1157
01:05:19,375 --> 01:05:20,793
<i>-</i> Hot enough for you or what?
- Good to see you.

1158
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,044
How are you doing, fellas?

1159
01:05:22,211 --> 01:05:24,046
So how much are
we talking about being taken here?

1160
01:05:24,213 --> 01:05:26,299
Yeah well, the newspapers
are downplaying it,

1161
01:05:26,465 --> 01:05:29,093
but we think
it's upwards of $10 million.

1162
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,429
- Jesus Christ.
<i>-</i> The largest one in history.

1163
01:05:31,596 --> 01:05:33,889
And the security guard,
there was only one?

1164
01:05:34,056 --> 01:05:36,392
Only one guard, but he doesn't
really seem that capable

1165
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:38,894
- of much of anything, sir.
<i>-</i> Well, seemed capable of shooting

1166
01:05:39,061 --> 01:05:41,606
a would-be robber two nights prior
according to this report here.

1167
01:05:41,772 --> 01:05:44,233
You're right about that,
sir, but listen,

1168
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,153
we think that whole thing
might have been a decoy.

1169
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:50,740
Because we've got the guy
on surveillance tape, right?

1170
01:05:50,906 --> 01:05:56,078
Two nights prior, he's disabling
a video camera in the back.

1171
01:05:56,245 --> 01:05:58,122
So you think the two are connected?

1172
01:05:58,289 --> 01:06:01,417
Yeah, but talking about
details, manpower--

1173
01:06:01,584 --> 01:06:03,586
there's no doubt about it--

1174
01:06:03,753 --> 01:06:05,254
we're talking Cosa Nostra.

1175
01:06:05,421 --> 01:06:07,965
And the detective who's been
on since the beginning--

1176
01:06:08,132 --> 01:06:09,759
Detective J. Ransone?

1177
01:06:09,925 --> 01:06:11,844
Yeah, he's setting up
a makeshift interrogation

1178
01:06:12,011 --> 01:06:14,221
over at Empire right now.

1179
01:06:14,388 --> 01:06:17,767
- You find that funny?
<i>-</i> Mr. Giuliani, there's no way in hell

1180
01:06:17,933 --> 01:06:20,811
that that greaseball guard could
pull off this job on his own.

1181
01:06:20,978 --> 01:06:23,606
It's just too big for him.
I'm willing to put my badge on it.

1182
01:06:23,773 --> 01:06:27,276
Well, no harm in letting him follow
through with the workers,

1183
01:06:27,443 --> 01:06:29,779
but I tend to agree
with Marichal here.

1184
01:06:29,945 --> 01:06:31,822
This thing stinks of organized crime.

1185
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:34,659
- Agreed.
- Go after all five families.

1186
01:06:34,825 --> 01:06:36,702
Someone's gonna talk.

1187
01:06:39,455 --> 01:06:42,291
Under District Attorney
Rudolph Giuliani's orders

1188
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:44,794
members of all five
of New York's crime families

1189
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,838
have been arrested to be questioned
in regard to the Empire heist.

1190
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:49,048
You missed some shit on your upper lip.

1191
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:50,424
<i>- You should shave that off.
- Now believed to be the largest</i>

1192
01:06:50,591 --> 01:06:52,301
since Lufthansa.

1193
01:06:52,468 --> 01:06:54,345
War...

1194
01:06:54,512 --> 01:06:57,223
- $8 million, 9 million, how much is it?
- Hey, how you doing?

1195
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:59,308
<i>-</i> No one seems to know anything...
- Hey, back off!

1196
01:06:59,475 --> 01:07:01,394
- ...Other than this is...
<i>-</i> Where's the money, Giuseppe?

1197
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,562
...The biggest heist in U.S. history.

1198
01:07:03,729 --> 01:07:08,359
Ladies and gentlemen,
someone out there has a lot of cash.

1199
01:07:08,526 --> 01:07:10,361
It's your half right there,
every penny.

1200
01:07:10,528 --> 01:07:13,155
<i>- Told you we could pull that off.
- You fucking ass!</i>

1201
01:07:13,322 --> 01:07:16,075
That's for breaking
my fucking face.

1202
01:07:17,201 --> 01:07:18,828
How else were you
gonna say you had

1203
01:07:18,994 --> 01:07:21,497
nothing to do with it, huh? Fuck!

1204
01:07:21,664 --> 01:07:23,791
I talked to Mike.
He wants to, uh--

1205
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:25,668
Mike wants to meet with us.

1206
01:07:27,002 --> 01:07:28,003
You fucking--

1207
01:07:29,672 --> 01:07:31,549
What was I supposed to do?
He called me.

1208
01:07:31,716 --> 01:07:34,218
He said we go in with
the Colombian deal on him and that's it.

1209
01:07:34,385 --> 01:07:36,512
He won't say nothing
to anybody, so that's it.

1210
01:07:36,679 --> 01:07:38,681
<i>- There it is.
- I'm gonna get in my car.</i>

1211
01:07:38,848 --> 01:07:40,933
You come around me again,
and I'm gonna fucking kill you.

1212
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:43,394
<i>-</i> What else was I supposed to say?
- I will fucking kill you.

1213
01:07:43,561 --> 01:07:45,855
<i>- You understand me?
- I just handed you $8 fucking million!</i>

1214
01:07:46,021 --> 01:07:47,898
You didn't hand me fucking shit,
you understand me?

1215
01:07:48,065 --> 01:07:49,859
- Get the fuck--
- Didn't hand me fucking shit.

1216
01:07:50,025 --> 01:07:51,402
And you walk the fuck away

1217
01:07:51,569 --> 01:07:53,320
and you tell Mike to do
the same or I'll kill you both.

1218
01:07:53,487 --> 01:07:55,030
- I'll fucking kill you.
- Yeah, fuck you!

1219
01:07:55,197 --> 01:07:57,366
I should have shot you when
you came through that fucking roof.

1220
01:07:57,533 --> 01:07:58,826
Fucking prick.

1221
01:08:24,769 --> 01:08:26,228
This fucking cocaine.

1222
01:08:33,736 --> 01:08:35,738
You know I should kill you, right?

1223
01:08:36,864 --> 01:08:38,783
Slit your throat...

1224
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:41,076
for backstabbing me like you did.

1225
01:08:43,788 --> 01:08:45,873
I mean,
that's why I'm here right now.

1226
01:08:47,124 --> 01:08:48,542
I'll pay you back.

1227
01:08:48,709 --> 01:08:50,669
And your friend?

1228
01:08:51,879 --> 01:08:54,048
He had nothing
to do with it. He just...

1229
01:08:54,215 --> 01:08:56,008
didn't rat me out, so.

1230
01:08:56,175 --> 01:08:58,719
That's it.

1231
01:09:00,179 --> 01:09:02,139
I'm not an asshole, Eddie.

1232
01:09:03,349 --> 01:09:05,518
Fucking look at me, okay?

1233
01:09:07,353 --> 01:09:08,938
Listen, I'm in.

1234
01:09:09,104 --> 01:09:11,232
I'm all the way in, so.

1235
01:09:11,398 --> 01:09:14,276
But Chris stays out of it
and that's the way it's gonna be.

1236
01:09:14,443 --> 01:09:15,778
You could shoot me, you could do
whatever you want to do,

1237
01:09:15,945 --> 01:09:17,321
but you know what?

1238
01:09:20,157 --> 01:09:22,451
Kill me, you don't find out
where the money is, and...

1239
01:09:22,618 --> 01:09:25,663
you know, and I'll tell
Spiro about Jimmy, so.

1240
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:28,123
You know?

1241
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:29,959
Okay.

1242
01:09:31,335 --> 01:09:33,170
It goes down tomorrow then.

1243
01:09:33,337 --> 01:09:35,464
Good.

1244
01:09:35,631 --> 01:09:37,967
Don't disappear.

1245
01:09:38,133 --> 01:09:40,469
- Not going anywhere.
- Yeah.

1246
01:09:40,636 --> 01:09:42,972
Good.
Now get the fuck out.

1247
01:09:43,138 --> 01:09:44,932
All right.

1248
01:09:55,651 --> 01:09:58,612
<i>-</i> You got something?
- Somewhere in here.

1249
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:05,327
Got it.

1250
01:10:05,494 --> 01:10:07,830
- Let's get outta here.
<i>-</i> What, we stepping out?

1251
01:10:07,997 --> 01:10:09,456
<i>- Yeah.
- Okay, let's do this.</i>

1252
01:10:14,295 --> 01:10:18,090
Michael, where's, um...

1253
01:10:20,259 --> 01:10:22,428
- Where's what?
<i>-</i> Where's Jimmy?

1254
01:10:22,595 --> 01:10:24,763
Where's he been lately?

1255
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:27,766
- Jimmy's working.
<i>-</i> No, I know, he hasn't been here in--

1256
01:10:27,933 --> 01:10:29,226
it's been like almost a week.

1257
01:10:29,393 --> 01:10:31,061
He's always with you.
I'm just wondering.

1258
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:32,521
I'm just wondering where he is.

1259
01:10:32,688 --> 01:10:34,398
I think he's got the--
the construction thing.

1260
01:10:34,565 --> 01:10:36,317
<i>- Oh yeah yeah.
- He's been working at that movie house.</i>

1261
01:10:36,483 --> 01:10:38,110
- Mm-hmm.
<i>-</i> So it's been real busy over there.

1262
01:10:38,277 --> 01:10:40,362
Yanni, that looks good. Can you
turn it on? You can't turn it on?

1263
01:10:40,529 --> 01:10:42,323
There's a lava
in the back I think.

1264
01:10:42,489 --> 01:10:43,574
It looks good anyway.

1265
01:10:43,741 --> 01:10:44,992
Where the hell are you going?

1266
01:10:45,159 --> 01:10:47,494
Use the bathroom.

1267
01:10:56,337 --> 01:10:57,880
Hey, I'm looking for a...

1268
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,882
Spiro Stravakis.

1269
01:11:00,049 --> 01:11:02,384
- Stavrakis.
<i>-</i> Stavrakis!

1270
01:11:02,551 --> 01:11:04,678
That's good.
Are the police asking?

1271
01:11:04,845 --> 01:11:07,723
- What, that obvious?
<i>-</i> Only if you're the police.

1272
01:11:09,058 --> 01:11:11,727
Yeah, we came here
about the Empire heist.

1273
01:11:11,894 --> 01:11:14,104
Just curious if anybody
knew anything about it.

1274
01:11:14,271 --> 01:11:16,065
The Empire heist in the Bronx?

1275
01:11:16,231 --> 01:11:17,858
- Mm-hmm.
<i>-</i> And you're here looking?

1276
01:11:18,025 --> 01:11:20,945
I thought the papers said
that was the Guineas.

1277
01:11:21,111 --> 01:11:23,197
<i>-</i> You know, the real mob.
- Ah, you know.

1278
01:11:23,364 --> 01:11:25,324
Big-time lowlifes,
small-time lowlifes--

1279
01:11:25,491 --> 01:11:27,868
it's all the same to me.

1280
01:11:29,078 --> 01:11:31,080
Ain't that right there, Michael...

1281
01:11:31,246 --> 01:11:33,874
Dimitriu?
Did I say that right?

1282
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:36,418
You come into my place
and you start saying people's names,

1283
01:11:36,585 --> 01:11:38,879
<i>-</i> but you never said your name.
- You're right.

1284
01:11:39,046 --> 01:11:41,507
- We didn't.
<i>-</i> And what are you insinuating?

1285
01:11:41,674 --> 01:11:44,426
That maybe Michael here had
something to do with this robbery?

1286
01:11:44,593 --> 01:11:47,304
Just want to ask your boy
if he have any ideas on it, that's all.

1287
01:11:47,471 --> 01:11:50,599
My boy, detectives,
has the good fucking sense to know

1288
01:11:50,766 --> 01:11:53,602
that if he or anyone around me had
anything to do with something like this

1289
01:11:53,769 --> 01:11:55,938
without my knowledge,
that they'd lose their balls.

1290
01:11:56,105 --> 01:12:00,067
So no, you can be certain
he has no ideas on this.

1291
01:12:00,234 --> 01:12:02,361
So you're answering for him?

1292
01:12:02,528 --> 01:12:05,030
<i>-</i> I just did.
- He's answering for you.

1293
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:12,121
Okay. Well, we got nothing else.

1294
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:17,334
- Yassou?
<i>-</i> Yassou, yeah.

1295
01:12:17,501 --> 01:12:18,836
All right.

1296
01:12:21,296 --> 01:12:22,423
Yassou.

1297
01:12:28,053 --> 01:12:29,096
Michael, have a seat.

1298
01:12:42,568 --> 01:12:45,779
Look at him,
he's talking to someone.

1299
01:12:47,656 --> 01:12:50,284
<i>- Son of a bitch.
- You sure?</i>

1300
01:12:50,451 --> 01:12:52,286
I'm positive.
He's looking right at the camera.

1301
01:12:52,453 --> 01:12:54,204
I've been looking
at this thing all afternoon.

1302
01:12:54,371 --> 01:12:56,540
Ah, here he is.

1303
01:12:56,707 --> 01:12:58,500
Son of a bitch.

1304
01:13:02,046 --> 01:13:03,672
Hey, Chris.
Hey, man.

1305
01:13:03,839 --> 01:13:05,340
- Hey.
<i>-</i> How you doing?

1306
01:13:05,507 --> 01:13:07,968
Come on in.
Hey, guys, give me the office for a sec.

1307
01:13:08,135 --> 01:13:09,928
<i>- Sure.
- Hey, listen, I never got the chance</i>

1308
01:13:10,095 --> 01:13:12,056
to properly thank you
for saving my life out there.

1309
01:13:12,222 --> 01:13:13,807
So thank you.

1310
01:13:13,974 --> 01:13:15,851
Yeah, I'm glad to see
you're doing okay.

1311
01:13:16,018 --> 01:13:17,603
Yeah, me too.
Here, grab a--

1312
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:19,271
grab a seat, sit down.

1313
01:13:21,523 --> 01:13:23,859
Listen, uh, thanks
for coming down, man.

1314
01:13:24,026 --> 01:13:26,028
You know, any time something
like this happens

1315
01:13:26,195 --> 01:13:28,322
we gotta bring you down,
we gotta talk to people.

1316
01:13:28,489 --> 01:13:31,116
It's all the procedural bullshit.
You know the drill.

1317
01:13:31,283 --> 01:13:33,202
<i>-</i> Yeah, for sure.
- Okay.

1318
01:13:33,368 --> 01:13:35,245
So I gotta ask you...

1319
01:13:35,412 --> 01:13:37,748
nothing seemed out
of the ordinary? Not a thing?

1320
01:13:37,915 --> 01:13:40,042
Uh, I know it sounds crazy,

1321
01:13:40,209 --> 01:13:42,127
but, you know,
I was making the rounds,

1322
01:13:42,294 --> 01:13:45,714
I went to the bathroom.
I didn't hear anything. I come back.

1323
01:13:47,049 --> 01:13:49,218
That's it.

1324
01:13:51,887 --> 01:13:53,639
You know these guys?

1325
01:13:55,516 --> 01:13:57,726
That guy's a Michael Dimitriu

1326
01:13:57,893 --> 01:14:00,145
and another guy's
Eddie Papastratos.

1327
01:14:00,312 --> 01:14:03,649
They're small time criminals,
but I wanted to know if you knew them.

1328
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:09,071
- Yeah, why?
<i>-</i> I was just checking, that's all.

1329
01:14:13,492 --> 01:14:15,828
I mean I haven't spoken
to them in a while, you know, if--

1330
01:14:17,162 --> 01:14:18,622
SO...

1331
01:14:18,789 --> 01:14:20,582
you know, I'm sure they had
nothing to do with this

1332
01:14:20,749 --> 01:14:23,210
<i>- if that's what you're saying.
- I didn't say that.</i>

1333
01:14:24,419 --> 01:14:25,712
But okay.

1334
01:14:28,757 --> 01:14:30,425
Okay, so,

1335
01:14:30,592 --> 01:14:32,594
you have any more questions
or is that it?

1336
01:14:32,761 --> 01:14:34,805
You said that there was
only one guy, right,

1337
01:14:34,972 --> 01:14:37,182
<i>-</i> who broke in, the robber?
- No no, I didn't.

1338
01:14:37,349 --> 01:14:39,476
You know,
I didn't see anyone, so.

1339
01:14:39,643 --> 01:14:41,562
Huh.

1340
01:14:41,728 --> 01:14:43,105
You know we got this video here

1341
01:14:43,272 --> 01:14:46,275
and, uh, near the money room

1342
01:14:46,441 --> 01:14:48,277
right before the guy
with the ski mask

1343
01:14:48,443 --> 01:14:50,612
looks up and he smashes
the surveillance camera,

1344
01:14:50,779 --> 01:14:52,447
it's like he's talking to someone.

1345
01:14:52,614 --> 01:14:53,615
Then he looks up

1346
01:14:53,782 --> 01:14:56,118
like someone told him
where the camera was.

1347
01:14:56,285 --> 01:14:57,744
It's the weirdest thing.

1348
01:14:57,911 --> 01:15:01,081
Like I told you,
I didn't see anyone, so.

1349
01:15:01,248 --> 01:15:03,625
Yeah, you said that already--
a few times.

1350
01:15:03,792 --> 01:15:06,086
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1351
01:15:06,253 --> 01:15:08,005
Okay, you don't know nothing.

1352
01:15:13,051 --> 01:15:14,595
Okay, are we good?

1353
01:15:14,761 --> 01:15:16,471
Yeah yeah yeah.
We're done.

1354
01:15:16,638 --> 01:15:18,098
Okay, great.

1355
01:15:18,265 --> 01:15:20,350
I thanked you
for saving my life, right?

1356
01:15:20,517 --> 01:15:22,644
- Yeah.
<i>-</i> Okay, good.

1357
01:15:24,605 --> 01:15:26,315
But that don't mean
for a goddamn second

1358
01:15:26,481 --> 01:15:28,358
that I won't hesitate
to drag your ass in

1359
01:15:28,525 --> 01:15:30,819
if I find out you've been lying
to me about all this shit.

1360
01:15:32,321 --> 01:15:33,989
Do you understand?

1361
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:37,242
Yeah, I got it.

1362
01:15:39,161 --> 01:15:40,329
All right, we're cool.

1363
01:15:42,539 --> 01:15:43,957
Now you can go.

1364
01:16:09,399 --> 01:16:11,193
Whoo!

1365
01:16:20,327 --> 01:16:21,703
Hey!

1366
01:16:24,539 --> 01:16:25,707
Spiro wants to talk.

1367
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:28,377
Get in.

1368
01:16:46,561 --> 01:16:48,105
Yo, Orlanda.

1369
01:16:59,324 --> 01:17:01,576
Please, sit down, yeah?

1370
01:17:01,743 --> 01:17:03,203
Here.

1371
01:17:12,087 --> 01:17:13,422
You're late, huh?

1372
01:17:18,385 --> 01:17:20,929
So this is where
we hang out, huh?

1373
01:17:21,096 --> 01:17:23,098
The big time.

1374
01:17:26,101 --> 01:17:28,812
Please, no secrets.

1375
01:17:30,355 --> 01:17:32,441
Put your bag down
right next to ours.

1376
01:17:34,901 --> 01:17:36,570
It's cool.

1377
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:47,789
Eight mill, all there.

1378
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:51,460
The coke pure?

1379
01:17:51,626 --> 01:17:53,462
Why do people always
ask that, huh?

1380
01:17:53,628 --> 01:17:56,214
It's the movies, yeah?
Of course.

1381
01:17:59,176 --> 01:18:00,302
Clean?

1382
01:18:00,469 --> 01:18:01,970
Of course.

1383
01:18:08,143 --> 01:18:10,645
Now you must have
serious financing

1384
01:18:10,812 --> 01:18:13,523
for Mike to make you his partner
instead of Jimmy.

1385
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:15,609
- Right?
- Yeah well,

1386
01:18:15,776 --> 01:18:17,819
listen, Jimmy ain't
a part of this no more.

1387
01:18:17,986 --> 01:18:19,404
Okay?

1388
01:18:23,825 --> 01:18:25,327
Okay.

1389
01:18:26,453 --> 01:18:28,163
Let's count it.

1390
01:18:33,877 --> 01:18:35,545
And now we wait, huh?

1391
01:18:35,712 --> 01:18:38,173
It's a lot of money to count.

1392
01:18:56,108 --> 01:18:57,401
Christo Christara.

1393
01:18:57,567 --> 01:19:00,529
Wow, you've been through
a lot lately, huh?

1394
01:19:00,695 --> 01:19:03,115
Some couple of fucking days.

1395
01:19:04,324 --> 01:19:05,867
We got something for you.

1396
01:19:06,034 --> 01:19:07,786
Where's--
where's our special guest?

1397
01:19:07,953 --> 01:19:09,371
Anybody know where
our special guest is?

1398
01:19:09,538 --> 01:19:12,207
- Taking a piss.
<i>-</i> He's taking a piss?

1399
01:19:14,376 --> 01:19:15,877
He's taking a piss.

1400
01:19:16,962 --> 01:19:19,005
Hey, he's taking a piss.

1401
01:19:20,966 --> 01:19:22,676
Okay, so.

1402
01:19:22,843 --> 01:19:25,720
Before you tell me where the money
from the robbery is in the Bronx--

1403
01:19:25,887 --> 01:19:27,848
and you're gonna fucking tell me,
which is the only reason

1404
01:19:28,014 --> 01:19:29,724
we don't bash your
fucking head in right now--

1405
01:19:29,891 --> 01:19:32,018
but before you do,
there's somebody I want you to meet

1406
01:19:32,185 --> 01:19:34,563
who's been telling me about a robbery
you didn't want to include me in on.

1407
01:19:34,729 --> 01:19:35,939
Spiro, listen,

1408
01:19:36,106 --> 01:19:37,899
I don't know what
you're talking about, okay?

1409
01:19:38,066 --> 01:19:40,235
Hey, I understand. I understand!
That's why I'm saying

1410
01:19:40,402 --> 01:19:42,112
I just want you
to meet somebody first.

1411
01:19:42,279 --> 01:19:44,114
It's not a big fucking deal!

1412
01:19:44,281 --> 01:19:46,575
And here he comes.
We don't have to wait any longer.

1413
01:19:46,741 --> 01:19:48,410
Our fucking special guest--

1414
01:19:48,577 --> 01:19:50,704
Mr. Jimmy back
from the fucking dead.

1415
01:19:50,871 --> 01:19:52,914
Unbelievable, right?

1416
01:19:53,081 --> 01:19:56,042
Next time you want to kill somebody,
make sure you fucking kill him!

1417
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:02,466
How you doing now, Christo, huh?

1418
01:20:10,015 --> 01:20:12,601
Now go get my fucking money.

1419
01:20:25,947 --> 01:20:27,282
Two?

1420
01:20:27,449 --> 01:20:28,783
Yeah.

1421
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:30,869
Eddie Papastratos
working tonight?

1422
01:20:32,162 --> 01:20:33,622
Not tonight.

1423
01:20:33,788 --> 01:20:35,540
How about his friend, Chris Potami?

1424
01:20:35,707 --> 01:20:37,751
Who's asking?

1425
01:20:37,918 --> 01:20:39,461
Cops.

1426
01:20:40,587 --> 01:20:43,173
How about some menus?

1427
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:46,510
Naw, it's all right, honey.
We really are cops though.

1428
01:20:46,676 --> 01:20:48,845
If it's okay,
we'd like to look in Eddie's locker.

1429
01:20:49,012 --> 01:20:50,764
Is that all right?

1430
01:20:51,806 --> 01:20:54,309
Eleni, come here.

1431
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:56,728
These guys say they're cops

1432
01:20:56,895 --> 01:20:59,356
and they want to look
in Eddie's locker or something.

1433
01:20:59,523 --> 01:21:01,733
You're cops, the two of you?

1434
01:21:03,652 --> 01:21:05,570
<i>- Those real?
- Yes ma'am.</i>

1435
01:21:05,737 --> 01:21:07,906
- Yeah.
<i>-</i> What'd he do?

1436
01:21:08,073 --> 01:21:09,824
Well, we're hoping nothing.

1437
01:21:11,368 --> 01:21:13,203
All right then.
Come on.

1438
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:15,330
<i>-</i> Just follow you?
- Yep.

1439
01:21:20,335 --> 01:21:22,170
Go ahead,
do what you want.

1440
01:21:22,337 --> 01:21:23,964
<i>-</i> Which one?
- Middle.

1441
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:26,424
<i>-</i> It's okay?
- Mmm.

1442
01:21:28,510 --> 01:21:30,971
Find any shit about another girl
in there, you hand it over to me.

1443
01:21:31,137 --> 01:21:32,847
Yeah, you got it.

1444
01:21:43,858 --> 01:21:45,777
No goddamn way.

1445
01:21:45,944 --> 01:21:47,612
Wow.

1446
01:21:54,828 --> 01:21:56,496
Is eight.

1447
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:00,292
Eight million.

1448
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:02,377
It's all there.

1449
01:22:02,544 --> 01:22:04,713
Here's 400 extra.

1450
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:08,091
It's yours.

1451
01:22:10,385 --> 01:22:12,220
Okay,

1452
01:22:12,387 --> 01:22:14,222
you can go now.

1453
01:22:15,557 --> 01:22:17,851
<i>- What are you talking about?
- Stand up,</i>

1454
01:22:18,018 --> 01:22:20,437
turn around and walk
out that door.

1455
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:23,315
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1456
01:22:24,566 --> 01:22:25,942
It's not hard.

1457
01:22:26,109 --> 01:22:28,069
Stand up...

1458
01:22:28,236 --> 01:22:29,821
turn around

1459
01:22:29,988 --> 01:22:31,448
<i>-</i> and walk out the door.
- Sit still.

1460
01:22:31,615 --> 01:22:33,325
What the fuck are you
talking about, walk out?

1461
01:22:33,491 --> 01:22:35,410
<i>- Whoa whoa whoa, relax relax.
- I said turn around,</i>

1462
01:22:35,577 --> 01:22:37,287
<i>- and walk out the door, yeah?
- What's going on?</i>

1463
01:22:37,454 --> 01:22:39,205
<i>-</i> Turn around and walk out the door.
- Okay, chill.

1464
01:22:39,372 --> 01:22:40,749
Put the gun down,
put the gun down.

1465
01:22:40,915 --> 01:22:42,959
- I said do yourself a favor.
<i>-</i> What the fuck is going on?

1466
01:22:43,126 --> 01:22:44,753
Walk out the door.

1467
01:22:44,919 --> 01:22:47,714
<i>-</i> Go!
- You shot me in my fucking mouth?

1468
01:22:47,881 --> 01:22:49,174
Get the fuck out!
Go now!

1469
01:22:49,341 --> 01:22:51,217
Get the fuck out of here now!

1470
01:22:51,384 --> 01:22:53,595
- Get the fuck out now!
<i>-</i> Are you fucking serious, huh?

1471
01:22:53,762 --> 01:22:55,764
- In the fucking mouth!
- Heavenly Father

1472
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,769
Save the people

1473
01:23:00,935 --> 01:23:03,229
Save their souls

1474
01:23:03,396 --> 01:23:05,607
- Save our father...
- Come on, come on, come on.

1475
01:23:05,774 --> 01:23:07,984
Save our mother...

1476
01:23:08,151 --> 01:23:09,944
Oh! Fuck!

1477
01:23:10,111 --> 01:23:12,781
<i>- Save the people...
- Get us our fucking money!</i>

1478
01:23:12,947 --> 01:23:14,866
Save their souls...

1479
01:23:51,653 --> 01:23:53,029
Eddie?

1480
01:23:55,156 --> 01:23:57,117
It's over.

1481
01:24:01,496 --> 01:24:02,497
I'll talk to him.

1482
01:24:04,374 --> 01:24:07,001
Eddie, Eddie.

1483
01:24:10,463 --> 01:24:11,673
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

1484
01:24:13,258 --> 01:24:15,844
My DA's got half
the Italian mob on lockdown,

1485
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:20,348
my lieutenant's wondering how
half the missing Empire money

1486
01:24:20,515 --> 01:24:24,269
landed in the lap of some
mid-level Colombian cocaine dealer

1487
01:24:24,436 --> 01:24:27,689
and I'm thinking you and your friend
know where the other half is.

1488
01:24:27,856 --> 01:24:30,024
So before I let you go--

1489
01:24:30,191 --> 01:24:32,152
and unfortunately I have to--

1490
01:24:32,318 --> 01:24:34,654
I've got two questions
for you, Eddie:

1491
01:24:36,197 --> 01:24:37,615
Where's Chris?

1492
01:24:41,870 --> 01:24:43,621
And where's the money?

1493
01:25:04,768 --> 01:25:07,604
Chris, Chris, what is going on?

1494
01:25:07,771 --> 01:25:10,356
I'm being serious right now.
You need to tell me what happened.

1495
01:25:10,523 --> 01:25:12,233
Shit, my father.

1496
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,736
- Fuck, come on.
<i>-</i> Chris, I'm being serious.

1497
01:25:14,903 --> 01:25:16,696
You need to look at me
and you need to tell me what's going on.

1498
01:25:16,863 --> 01:25:18,698
Whatever happens, you check
the fucking statue, okay?

1499
01:25:18,865 --> 01:25:20,116
<i>-</i> You check the statue.
- Chris, what?!

1500
01:25:20,283 --> 01:25:22,243
<i>-</i> The money's in the fucking statue.
- Chris!

1501
01:25:23,244 --> 01:25:24,829
Chris.

1502
01:25:35,298 --> 01:25:36,883
Chris!

1503
01:25:38,092 --> 01:25:39,844
Yo, Chris!

1504
01:25:41,596 --> 01:25:43,556
What the fuck are you doing here?

1505
01:25:43,723 --> 01:25:46,184
They know everything.
They fucking know everything.

1506
01:25:46,351 --> 01:25:48,102
- What, who?
<i>-</i> The cops know everything.

1507
01:25:48,269 --> 01:25:51,022
<i>- They got the fucking map.
- You come to me?!</i>

1508
01:25:51,189 --> 01:25:52,732
- Oh fuck.
<i>-</i> What do you want me to do?

1509
01:25:52,899 --> 01:25:54,859
It ain't that easy, bro.
It ain't that easy.

1510
01:25:55,026 --> 01:25:56,778
Hey, you told me Jimmy was dead.

1511
01:25:56,945 --> 01:25:58,613
He ain't fucking dead, Eddie!
He's alive.

1512
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:01,366
What are you talking about?
I saw Mike kill him with my own eyes.

1513
01:26:01,533 --> 01:26:03,326
Well, he ain't dead, okay,
and we're fucked!

1514
01:26:03,493 --> 01:26:05,328
All my money's gone.
All my money's gone right now.

1515
01:26:05,495 --> 01:26:06,955
<i>- I need some money.
- Oh, you need some money?</i>

1516
01:26:07,121 --> 01:26:09,082
- I need some money, ple--
<i>-</i> I thought you said the cops need it?

1517
01:26:09,249 --> 01:26:10,500
- Now get the fuck outta here!
<i>-</i> You gotta give me that money

1518
01:26:10,667 --> 01:26:13,711
right now. I know
it's in here somewhere, bro.

1519
01:26:13,878 --> 01:26:15,088
<i>- I don't want to do anything.
- I'm not gonna give you</i>

1520
01:26:15,255 --> 01:26:16,256
any fucking money, Eddie!

1521
01:26:16,422 --> 01:26:18,466
I don't want to do anything
right now, okay? Don't make me do

1522
01:26:18,633 --> 01:26:20,635
<i>-</i> anything I don't want to fucking do.
- The fuck are you doing?

1523
01:26:20,802 --> 01:26:22,762
Don't make me fucking do
anything right now, okay?

1524
01:26:22,929 --> 01:26:25,348
I'm so fucking serious right now.
Just show me where it is right now.

1525
01:26:25,515 --> 01:26:27,350
Just show me where
the fucking money is, okay?

1526
01:26:27,517 --> 01:26:29,310
- My money's for my family.
- I'm fucking sorry!

1527
01:26:29,477 --> 01:26:31,312
<i>-</i> For my parents to get a house.
- I don't want it all!

1528
01:26:31,479 --> 01:26:33,857
You could buy 10 fucking houses
with that fucking money!

1529
01:26:34,023 --> 01:26:36,276
What about me, okay?

1530
01:26:37,986 --> 01:26:39,153
Don't think I won't do it.

1531
01:26:41,364 --> 01:26:43,324
Don't think I won't fucking shoot!

1532
01:26:43,491 --> 01:26:44,659
Oh fuck!

1533
01:26:46,828 --> 01:26:49,497
<i>- Fuck.

1534
01:26:49,664 --> 01:26:51,165
Get up, Eddie.

<i>- The next one kills you, Eddie.

<i>- Yeah yeah.

<i>-</i> This is over! You stay right there!

1554
01:27:36,753 --> 01:27:38,713

1559
01:27:49,933 --> 01:27:51,309
It's clear!

Hey, you fuck!
Hey, you fuck, hey, watch it!

1561
01:27:53,561 --> 01:27:55,730
Off off, hands off!
Hands off him, hands off.

1562
01:27:55,897 --> 01:27:58,024
Hey, he's my father,
don't you fucking hurt him!

1563
01:27:58,191 --> 01:27:59,901
Hey hey hey, Chris, no!

1564
01:28:00,068 --> 01:28:02,195
- Ow! Fuck! Ow!
<i>-</i> Hey! Fuck, Johnson!

1565
01:28:02,362 --> 01:28:04,864
Take it easy, take it easy.

1566
01:28:05,031 --> 01:28:06,074
Oh fuck!

1567
01:28:07,241 --> 01:28:09,077
It's okay.
It's okay, Christo.

1568
01:28:10,745 --> 01:28:12,455
It's over now.

1569
01:28:12,622 --> 01:28:15,708
- I'm sorry, Father. I'm sorry.
<i>-</i> It's over now.

<i>-</i> Let's go.

1571
01:28:23,758 --> 01:28:25,259
I'm fucking--
I'm fucking sorry.

1572
01:28:25,426 --> 01:28:27,178
<i>-</i> It's okay, Christo.
- I fucked up.

1573
01:28:28,262 --> 01:28:29,847
It's over now.

1574
01:28:36,104 --> 01:28:38,439
Ah fuck. I fucked up.

1575
01:28:38,606 --> 01:28:41,359
Yeah. Yeah, you did, Chris.

1576
01:28:42,402 --> 01:28:43,653
Yeah, you did.

1577
01:29:11,639 --> 01:29:14,767
Hey, boss, still got a lot
of money unaccounted for here.

1578
01:29:14,934 --> 01:29:16,936
And don't you know it.

1579
01:29:18,229 --> 01:29:20,523
You think your boy's gonna talk?

1580
01:29:20,690 --> 01:29:23,526
Yeah.
I think he'll come to his senses.

1581
01:29:25,153 --> 01:29:26,612
The FBI said today

1582
01:29:26,779 --> 01:29:28,823
that the man whose job
it was to protect the money

1583
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:31,492
stole it:
Christos Potamitis.

1584
01:29:31,659 --> 01:29:33,995
We spoiled his vacation
where he's been

1585
01:29:34,162 --> 01:29:36,664
sunning himself by the pool
most of the afternoon.

1586
01:29:36,831 --> 01:29:39,208
It was a matter of me trying to get

1587
01:29:39,375 --> 01:29:41,753
a bag to come to me.

1588
01:29:41,919 --> 01:29:44,005
The building's landlord
said he was amazed

1589
01:29:44,172 --> 01:29:46,007
the burglars could get
through the roof.

1590
01:29:46,174 --> 01:29:47,800
Uh, we specifically made this roof

1591
01:29:47,967 --> 01:29:50,720
to have steel construction
because we wanted to have

1592
01:29:50,887 --> 01:29:52,180
the security in there.

1593
01:29:52,346 --> 01:29:54,348
Just dollar signs,
you know, coming at me.

1594
01:29:54,515 --> 01:29:55,850
You know? "Here we are."

1595
01:29:56,017 --> 01:29:58,144
More arrests are
expected says the FBI,

1596
01:29:58,311 --> 01:30:00,438
as is recovery of the 11 million,

1597
01:30:00,605 --> 01:30:02,398
which is still missing.

1598
01:30:02,565 --> 01:30:04,525
And the money still to this day is gone?

1599
01:30:04,692 --> 01:30:06,569
<i>-</i> That's correct.
- Vanished?

1600
01:30:06,736 --> 01:30:08,321
Just vanished.

1601
01:30:08,488 --> 01:30:11,741
- Into thin air?
- Into thin air.

1602
01:30:11,908 --> 01:30:14,285
The way it disappeared
out of the money room,

1603
01:30:14,452 --> 01:30:16,037
it disappeared out of our hands.

1604
01:30:16,204 --> 01:30:18,206
You looked like you were
about to say something.

1605
01:30:18,372 --> 01:30:19,373
No.

1606
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:21,084
Okay.

1607
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:24,212
Seems it never rains

1608
01:30:24,378 --> 01:30:28,382
In southern California

1609
01:30:30,009 --> 01:30:32,345
Seems I've often heard

1610
01:30:32,512 --> 01:30:36,557
That kind of talk before

1611
01:30:36,724 --> 01:30:41,729
It never rains in California

1612
01:30:41,896 --> 01:30:46,192
But, girl, don't they warn ya

1613
01:30:46,359 --> 01:30:49,403
It pours

1614
01:30:49,570 --> 01:30:54,158
Man, it pours

1615
01:30:54,325 --> 01:30:57,912
Out of work,
I'm out of my head

1616
01:30:58,079 --> 01:31:01,707
Out of self-respect,
I'm out of bread

1617
01:31:01,874 --> 01:31:05,586
I'm underloved, I'm underfed

1618
01:31:05,753 --> 01:31:09,132
I wanna go home!

1619
01:31:09,298 --> 01:31:14,345
It never rains in California

1620
01:31:14,512 --> 01:31:18,516
But, girl, don't they warn ya

1621
01:31:18,683 --> 01:31:21,936
It pours

1622
01:31:22,103 --> 01:31:25,690
Man, it pours

1623
01:31:42,999 --> 01:31:46,711
Will you tell the folks back home

1624
01:31:46,878 --> 01:31:49,797
I nearly made it?

1625
01:31:51,799 --> 01:31:54,760
Had offers, but don't know

1626
01:31:54,927 --> 01:31:57,680
Which one to take

1627
01:31:57,847 --> 01:31:59,891
Please

1628
01:32:00,057 --> 01:32:03,686
Don't tell them
how you found me

1629
01:32:03,853 --> 01:32:07,148
Don't tell 'em how you found me

1630
01:32:07,315 --> 01:32:10,526
Gimme a break

1631
01:32:10,693 --> 01:32:14,071
Give me a break

1632
01:32:15,531 --> 01:32:21,996
Seems it never rains
in southern California

1633
01:32:23,706 --> 01:32:30,755
Seems I've often heard
that kind of talk before

1634
01:32:30,922 --> 01:32:36,427
It never rains in California

1635
01:32:36,594 --> 01:32:40,181
But, girl, don't they warn ya

1636
01:32:40,348 --> 01:32:43,768
It pours

1637
01:32:43,935 --> 01:32:47,230
Man, it pours.
