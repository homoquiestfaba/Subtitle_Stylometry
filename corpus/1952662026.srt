1
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,670
That's a dead end.

2
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,631
Come on, Shrek, who needs a map,
when you got animal instinct.

3
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:54,054
Damn bugs! Stupid...

4
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,850
Come on here!
- Shrek, a little help here!

5
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:59,892
What are you...
- I say we take 10-th in 305

6
00:00:59,992 --> 00:01:03,689
and get off at the Fairy-tale Falls.
- What are you talking about?

7
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,357
Or we can fly!

8
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,651
Is there an off button on you?

9
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,490
What's wrong, princess?

10
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:16,159
You shouldn't be this unhappy
until years into the marriage.

11
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,912
It's the happiest day of my life!

12
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,832
Let me guess.
You're overwhelmed by love.

13
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,000
No!

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,251
I mean, yes...

15
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,962
But that's not why...
- A shrimp part was bad?

16
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,005
No, Donkey!

17
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,548
Wait, wait!
I got it! I got it!

18
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:32,467
You always wanted a puppy,
but all you got was tosters!

19
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,093
No!

20
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,970
I'm sitting in an onion!

21
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:38,724
This carriage is one big onion.

22
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,477
Why didn't you say so?
I'll turn on the air.

23
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,231
Much better.

24
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,816
Noble steed at your survice!

25
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,859
Would you look at that.

26
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,236
Donkey, I found a shortcut.

27
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:54,781
Are you crazy?

28
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:57,075
That's a big one.

29
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,869
I hate spiders!

30
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,915
Stop that!

31
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,041
Where did it go?

32
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,005
You are too easy to scare.
Come on.

33
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,882
That forest could be anything!

34
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,967
I ain't going in there!

35
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,844
Listen, I'm an ogre.

36
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,930
I'm the one that does the scaring.

37
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,224
What's there to be scared of?

38
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,059
That!

39
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:23,727
Telonious?

40
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,396
Hey, what are you doing?

41
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,690
I'm sorry, princess.
Honey moon is over.

42
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,158
Let go!

44
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,244
Fiona!

45
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,203
Shrek!

46
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,746
Fiona!

47
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,289
Let me go!

48
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,208
To the carriage!

49
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,459
Shrek!

50
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,879
We got a donkey driving a carriage
made from an onion.

51
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,756
It's dark and our horses
are wearing sunglasses.

52
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,007
Cut to the chase, Donkey!

53
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,260
Just cut to the chase!
- Hit it, boys!

54
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,766
Fiona!

55
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,894
Shrek!

56
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:09,857
Watch out!

57
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,985
This 3-D is pretty cool.
- Donkey!

58
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,696
I saw it in another dimension.

59
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,864
Oh, for the love of Pete!

60
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:17,990
I'll poke your eyes out!

61
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,867
Help!

62
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,369
All done.

63
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,914
No, no, no!

64
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:28,959
No!

65
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:32,921
That was close.

66
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,256
That's sweet!

68
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:36,341
Shrek!

69
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,384
Watch out!

72
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:48,979
Hey, Shrek!

73
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,731
I hope you're insured!

74
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,067
That house cost me a lot of do...

75
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,655
Is there a doctor in the house?

76
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,698
Sorry about that, Gingy!

77
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:00,741
That's gross.

78
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,542
Oh, no!

79
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:19,843
I can see! I can see!

80
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,221
Never mind.

81
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,226
Fiona!

82
00:04:28,145 --> 00:04:31,939
Shrek, this isn't another one
of those shortcuts, is it?

83
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,732
Just get a move on!

84
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:35,817
Okay. I'm not afraid.

85
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:37,945
Fiona!

86
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:38,862
I can do this.

87
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:40,531
I'm a noble steed.

88
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:45,407
It's all right. It's just a park
with no children and no playground.

92
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,038
Shrek!

93
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,999
I feel dead people!

94
00:04:54,753 --> 00:05:02,261
Are you getting the willies, the trembles,
the shakes, the heebie-jeebies...

95
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:05,305
Stop messing with me, Shrek!
This place is already creeping me out.

97
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,100
Don't tell me you are
afraid of ghosts.

98
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:09,893
I'm not afraid.

99
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,147
What a crack up.

100
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:16,149
Shrek!

101
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:17,317
Shrek, wait up!

102
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,614
Talk about rewriting history.

103
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,664
Well, looks like Farquaad is still trying
to compensate for something.

104
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:32,165
I wander what that could be.

105
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,294
I don't know.
This is just playing freaky.

106
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,504
I wander if he is behind all this.

107
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,173
That's just crazy talk.

108
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,476
Now I'm seeing things!

109
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,562
Can we get out of here? Please!

110
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,647
Sure! Of course!

111
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,109
You wouldn't happen to have another
carriage in your pocket, would you?

112
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,236
Donkeys don't have pockets.

113
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,322
But some of us have wings.

114
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,289
Wrong dragon!

115
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,416
Wrong whistle!

116
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:16,460
Farquaad?

117
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,754
What have you done with my wife?

118
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,047
Your wife?

119
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,257
Don't you mean your widow?

120
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,927
I know I seeing you die
in the first movie!

121
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,094
Fools!

122
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,305
This time is your turn to be antre.

123
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,683
Okay, my sweet, take care of them.

124
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,685
Bon apeti!

125
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,064
Will you stop that?!

126
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,236
Shut it!

127
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,322
You can go first.
I'll be the dessert.

128
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:49,368
Oh, great!
- That's my girl!

129
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,542
Hey, baby,
I was hoping you'd show up!

130
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,794
Princess at 3 o'clock!

131
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,087
Shrek!

132
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,297
Hi, princess!
- Fiona!

133
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:18,355
Oh, no! Shrek!

134
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,485
Oops! Sorry.

135
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:26,864
Coming in!

136
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,117
Dive! Dive!
- Got it. Dive! Dive!

137
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,578
This is Red Dragon.
We're going in.

138
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,504
Defensive action!

139
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,591
Lack and load!

140
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,845
Stay on target!
Stay on target! Stay on target!

141
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,181
Fire'em out!

142
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,558
On my mark, retract wings!

143
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:55,684
Now!

144
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,278
Smooth move, Exlax!
- Like I always say:

147
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:11,575
Behind every successful donkey
there's a fire-breathing dragon!

148
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,963
You might as well
stop struggling princess.

149
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,466
Soon you and I will be together forever.

150
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,010
With you as my spirit queen,

151
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,012
I'll be king of the underworld!

152
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,764
Over my dead body!

153
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:34,973
Exactly.

154
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,726
Over she goes, Telonious!

155
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:44,066
Telonious?

156
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,151
Sorry, princess.

157
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,655
No! Nitwit!
Not with you on it!

158
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:50,614
What?

159
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,035
I deserved that.

160
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,245
And that too.

162
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:09,132
Sorry, Telonious.
- Never mind him.

163
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,051
See you on the other side,
princess!

164
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:11,927
Never!

165
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,059
Stop playing hard to get.

166
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,270
Stop it!
- You know I'm irresistible.

167
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,896
Fiona!
- Shrek!

168
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,189
Impossible!

169
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,233
I thought they were dragon food!

170
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,359
We'll save you!

171
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,654
Are you okay?

172
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:31,905
I think so.

173
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,616
I don't think so!

173
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:36,616
On, no!

174
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:42,541
Splendid!

175
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,711
They all fall for me
sooner or later.

176
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:00,851
Fiona!

177
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,144
Yes, Shrek?!

178
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:04,813
My short life is flashing
before my eyes!

179
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:09,818
I love You!
- I love you too!

180
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:24,538
Fiona, my ghostly queen,
where are you?

183
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,127
Right over here, sweety.

184
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,172
My angel!

185
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,759
Oh, no! Not again!

186
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,304
We've got a loaded dragon here...
- ...and we're not afraid to use it!

187
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:38,889
It was just a joke!

188
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:39,891
Stay away!
- Fire!

189
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,891
No!

190
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:18,637
Thanks, Dragon.

191
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,641
And thank you, Donkey.
You truly are a noble steed.

192
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:26,103
Look at you, Donkey, all covered with fur!
I love you!

193
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,356
Shucks!
I think I'm gonna cry.

194
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:30,774
Come on, baby.
Let's go home.

195
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,318
Let's go home and make some waffles!

196
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:37,155
Have I told you lately
that I love you?

197
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,699
