00:00:52,884 --> 00:00:55,254

00:01:05,663 --> 00:01:07,132

00:01:16,307 --> 00:01:19,144
MAN VOICE-OVER: Are you paying attention?

7
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,348
Good.

8
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:26,017
If you're not
listening carefully,

9
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:31,156
you will miss things,
important things.

10
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:32,857
I will not pause.

11
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,259
I will not repeat myself,

12
00:01:34,292 --> 00:01:37,296
and you will not interrupt me.

13
00:01:38,696 --> 00:01:42,267
You think that because
you are sitting where you are

14
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,035
and I am sitting where I am

15
00:01:44,068 --> 00:01:47,105
that you are in control
of what is about to happen.

16
00:01:47,138 --> 00:01:49,841
You're mistaken.

17
00:01:49,874 --> 00:01:51,910
I am in control.

18
00:01:51,943 --> 00:01:57,683
Because I know things
that you do not know.

19
00:01:58,683 --> 00:01:59,884

20
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:03,388
Manchester Police Department,
please hold.

21
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:05,156

22
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:06,758
CONSTABLE THROUGH RADIO: Windows broken.

23
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,226
Home's been ransacked.

24
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:10,261
Send a detective down, will you?

25
00:02:10,294 --> 00:02:12,731
MAN VOICE-OVER:
What I will need from you now

26
00:02:12,764 --> 00:02:15,100
is a commitment.

27
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:18,069
You will listen closely,
and you will not

28
00:02:18,102 --> 00:02:20,372
judge me until I am finished.

29
00:02:20,405 --> 00:02:22,340
If you cannot commit to this,

30
00:02:22,373 --> 00:02:24,109
then please leave the room.

31
00:02:24,142 --> 00:02:25,643
MAN 2: Come in.

32
00:02:25,676 --> 00:02:26,945
But if you choose to stay,

33
00:02:26,978 --> 00:02:29,047
remember you chose to be here.

34
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,615
What happens

35
00:02:30,648 --> 00:02:34,119
from this moment forwards
is not my responsibility.

36
00:02:34,152 --> 00:02:35,787
It's yours.

37
00:02:38,856 --> 00:02:42,160
Pay attention.

38
00:02:45,596 --> 00:02:47,666

39
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:54,973
DETECTIVE: What's all this, then?

40
00:02:55,006 --> 00:02:56,908
SERGEANT: Turing, Alan.

41
00:02:56,941 --> 00:02:58,977
Professor at King's.

42
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,678
Seems there's been a burglary.

43
00:03:00,711 --> 00:03:02,113
Oh? What of?

44
00:03:02,146 --> 00:03:04,315
Well, that's just it.
Nothing missing, really.

45
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:05,350

46
00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:07,819
What's he doing in Manchester?

47
00:03:07,852 --> 00:03:11,156
Something with machines.

48
00:03:14,692 --> 00:03:16,762

49
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:19,664
The project at the NPL.

50
00:03:19,697 --> 00:03:22,234
I checked, but he won't
say what it's on.

51
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:26,037
Professor Turing?

52
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,306
Detective Nock,
Manchester Police.

53
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:35,647
Sergeant Staehl here tells me
you had a burglary last night.

54
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,049
Professor Turing?

55
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:41,986
Take a step back, and
don't breath heavily.

56
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:44,355
- Breathe?
- Undiluted cyanide.

57
00:03:44,388 --> 00:03:45,924
It-it wouldn't take

58
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:49,093
more than a thimbleful
to kill you.

59
00:03:49,126 --> 00:03:51,196
Ah.

60
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:52,897
Disappointing.

61
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,232
Pardon?

62
00:03:54,265 --> 00:03:57,268
I-I had hoped for a bit more.

63
00:03:57,301 --> 00:03:59,204
Sergeant Staehl, is it just me,
or do you get the sense

64
00:03:59,237 --> 00:04:00,238
that we're being insulted?

65
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:02,040
Last night, you had a break-in.

66
00:04:02,073 --> 00:04:05,109
Your neighbor, Mr. Springborn,
called to report the noise.

67
00:04:05,142 --> 00:04:07,145
He said there was
quite a ruckus.

68
00:04:07,178 --> 00:04:08,613
Only you say nothing was taken.

69
00:04:08,646 --> 00:04:10,682
It's odd.
So how about you tell us

70
00:04:10,715 --> 00:04:12,884
what happened, and we'll find
the chap who did this.

71
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:14,319
Gentlemen,

72
00:04:14,352 --> 00:04:15,687
I-I don't believe

73
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,555
that you could find the chap
that did this

74
00:04:17,588 --> 00:04:20,091
if, uh, he walked up to you
and spat in your face.

75
00:04:20,124 --> 00:04:21,826
Uh, what I could us right now

76
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:25,163
is not a bobby,
but a really good cleaning lady.

77
00:04:25,196 --> 00:04:27,232
So unless one of you
has a-an apron

78
00:04:27,265 --> 00:04:28,566
in your car, I suggest

79
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:31,803
you file your reports
and leave me alone.

80
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,874
As you say, Professor Turing.

81
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:41,613
Best of luck with your cyanide.

82
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:43,348
STAEHL VOICE-OVER: I'll give you a quid

83
00:04:43,381 --> 00:04:45,283
if you can name me
a more insufferable sod.

84
00:04:45,316 --> 00:04:47,151
Seemed a bit forced,
though, didn't it?

85
00:04:47,184 --> 00:04:48,486
Don't know what you mean.

86
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,255
Well, if you didn't want
a pair of bobbies

87
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:51,990
digging around in your
personal affairs,

88
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:55,159
that'd have been a stellar way
to make sure they don't.

89
00:04:55,192 --> 00:04:57,295
Tell me you don't think
this is suspicious.

90
00:04:57,328 --> 00:04:58,630
I don't think
this is suspicious.

91
00:04:58,663 --> 00:05:00,765
A mysterious professor
who won't admit

92
00:05:00,798 --> 00:05:03,235
he's had something stolen
from his house?

93
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:07,772
I think Alan Turing's
hiding something.

94
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:15,747

95
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,849

96
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:18,983
War declared!

97
00:05:19,016 --> 00:05:21,085
800,000 children evacuated!

98
00:05:21,118 --> 00:05:22,987
German bombs on their way!

99
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,289
Get your papers here!

100
00:05:24,322 --> 00:05:25,623
Fresh off the press!

101
00:05:25,656 --> 00:05:26,457
War declared!

102
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,927
800,000 children evacuated!

103
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,062
German bombs expected soon!

104
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:33,365

105
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:51,216

106
00:05:56,687 --> 00:05:58,423
NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN: This morning,

107
00:05:58,456 --> 00:06:00,959
the British Ambassador in Berlin

108
00:06:00,992 --> 00:06:02,560
handed the German government

109
00:06:02,593 --> 00:06:05,430
a final note stating that

110
00:06:05,463 --> 00:06:09,300
unless we heard from
them, by 11:00,

111
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,804
a state of war would
exist between us.

112
00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:13,938

113
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:15,707
I have to tell you now

114
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,543
that no such undertaking
has been received.

115
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:20,945
And that, consequently,

116
00:06:20,978 --> 00:06:25,617
this country is at
war with Germany.

117
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,420

118
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:36,328

119
00:06:47,071 --> 00:06:49,007

120
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:52,644
KING GEORGE VI: For the second time

121
00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:58,082
in the lives of most
of us, we are...

122
00:06:58,115 --> 00:06:59,784
at war.

123
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:04,789
To find a peaceful way out...

124
00:07:07,858 --> 00:07:09,928
Papers, please.

125
00:07:26,644 --> 00:07:28,747

126
00:07:40,324 --> 00:07:42,594

127
00:07:46,263 --> 00:07:47,732
What are you doing here?

128
00:07:47,765 --> 00:07:50,268
Oh, uh,
the lady told me to wait.

129
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:51,836
In my office?

130
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:54,138
She tell you to help
yourself to tea

131
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:55,273
while you were here?

132
00:07:55,306 --> 00:07:58,142
Uh, no, she didn't.

133
00:07:58,175 --> 00:07:59,410
She obviously didn't tell you

134
00:07:59,443 --> 00:08:01,079
what a joke was, then,
either, I gather.

135
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:03,147
Was she supposed to?

136
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,749

137
00:08:04,782 --> 00:08:06,250
Who are you?

138
00:08:06,283 --> 00:08:08,319
Alan Turing.

139
00:08:08,352 --> 00:08:10,555
Ah, Turing.

140
00:08:10,588 --> 00:08:11,956
The mathematician.

141
00:08:11,989 --> 00:08:13,424
Correct.

142
00:08:13,457 --> 00:08:14,792
- However could I have guessed?
- Well, you didn't.

143
00:08:14,825 --> 00:08:17,062
You just read it on
that piece of paper.

144
00:08:18,996 --> 00:08:20,498
King's College, Cambridge.

145
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:22,333
Now, it says here you were
a bit of a prodigy

146
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:23,601
in the maths department.

147
00:08:23,634 --> 00:08:26,704
I-I'm not sure I can
evaluate that, Mr...

148
00:08:26,737 --> 00:08:28,873
- How old are you, Mr. Turing?
- Uh, 27.

149
00:08:28,906 --> 00:08:31,409
And how old were you when you
became a Fellow at Cambridge?

150
00:08:31,442 --> 00:08:33,711
- 24.
- And how old were you

151
00:08:33,744 --> 00:08:35,480
when you published
this paper that has a title

152
00:08:35,513 --> 00:08:36,614
I can barely understand?

153
00:08:36,647 --> 00:08:39,250
- Uh, 23.
- And you don't think

154
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:41,552
that qualifies you
as a certified prodigy?

155
00:08:41,585 --> 00:08:43,554
Well, Newton discovered
binomial theorem aged 22.

156
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:47,024
Einstein wrote four papers
that changed the world

157
00:08:47,057 --> 00:08:48,292
by the age of 26.

158
00:08:48,325 --> 00:08:50,962
As far as I can tell, I've...

159
00:08:50,995 --> 00:08:52,563
I've barely made par.

160
00:08:52,596 --> 00:08:54,132
My God, you're serious.

161
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:55,566
Would you prefer I made a joke?

162
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:57,602
Oh, I don't think you know
what those are.

163
00:08:57,635 --> 00:08:59,370
Hardly seems fair that
that's a requirement

164
00:08:59,403 --> 00:09:00,638
for employment here, Mr...

165
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,740
Commander Denniston, Royal Navy.

166
00:09:02,773 --> 00:09:04,242
All right,
Mr. Turing, I'll bite.

167
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:06,944
Why do you wish to work
for His Majesty's government?

168
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:08,713
Oh, I don't, really.

169
00:09:08,746 --> 00:09:11,716
Are you a bleeding pacifist?

170
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:14,285
I'm... agnostic about violence.

171
00:09:14,318 --> 00:09:15,586
Well, you do realize

172
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:17,488
that 600 miles away from London

173
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:19,557
there's this nasty little chap
called Hitler

174
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,692
who wants to engulf Europe
in tyranny?

175
00:09:21,725 --> 00:09:23,928
Politics isn't really
my area of expertise.

176
00:09:23,961 --> 00:09:25,296
Really?

177
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:27,698
Well, I believe
you've just set the record

178
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:28,800
for the shortest job interview

179
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,468
in British military history.

180
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:31,903
Oh, uh...

181
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:33,971
Mother says I can be off-putting
sometimes on account

182
00:09:34,004 --> 00:09:36,240
of being one of the best
mathematicians in the world.

183
00:09:36,273 --> 00:09:38,142
In the world?

184
00:09:38,175 --> 00:09:39,710
Oh, yes.

185
00:09:39,743 --> 00:09:42,246
Do you know how many people
I've rejected for this program?

186
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,549
- No.
- Well, that's right,

187
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:46,050
because we're
a top-secret program.

188
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,486
But I'll tell you,
just because we're friends,

189
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,921
that only last week,

190
00:09:49,954 --> 00:09:52,924
I rejected one of our
great nation's top linguists.

191
00:09:52,957 --> 00:09:55,426
Knows German better
than Bertolt Brecht.

192
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:56,794
I don't speak German.

193
00:09:56,827 --> 00:09:58,396
What?

194
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:01,532
I don't... speak German.

195
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:03,406
Well, how the hell
were you supposed to decrypt

196
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:04,936
German communications
if you don't...

197
00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:07,004
I don't know, speak German?

198
00:10:07,037 --> 00:10:09,674
Well, I'm really quite excellent
at crossword puzzles.

199
00:10:09,707 --> 00:10:12,443
- Margaret!
- The German codes are a puzzle.

200
00:10:12,476 --> 00:10:14,145
A game, just like
any other game.

201
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:16,214
- Margaret, where are you?
- I'm really very good at games.

202
00:10:16,247 --> 00:10:17,648
Uh, puzzles.

203
00:10:17,681 --> 00:10:20,384
And this is the most difficult
puzzle in the world.

204
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:22,220
Margaret!

205
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:23,621
For the love of God.

206
00:10:23,654 --> 00:10:24,889
This is a joke, obviously.

207
00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:27,725
I'm afraid I don't know
what those are,

208
00:10:27,758 --> 00:10:29,694
Commander Denniston.

209
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:32,496
Have a pleasant trip
back to Cambridge, Professor.

210
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:33,664
Enigma.

211
00:10:33,697 --> 00:10:35,967
You called for me?

212
00:10:38,469 --> 00:10:40,104

213
00:10:43,274 --> 00:10:45,042
That's what you're doing here.

214
00:10:45,075 --> 00:10:47,912
The top-secret program
at Bletchley.

215
00:10:47,945 --> 00:10:51,449
You're trying to break
the German Enigma machine.

216
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:53,818
What makes you think that?

217
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:56,187
It's the greatest
encryption device in history,

218
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,657
and the Germans use it
for all major communications.

219
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,460
If the Allies broke Enigma,

220
00:11:02,493 --> 00:11:04,262
well,

221
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:06,397
this would turn
into a very short war, indeed.

222
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,166
Of course that's what
you're working on.

223
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:12,036
But you also haven't got
anywhere with it.

224
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:13,671
If you had, you wouldn't
be hiring cryptographers

225
00:11:13,704 --> 00:11:15,606
out of university.

226
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:17,808
Y-You need me a lot
more than I need you.

227
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:21,646
I-I like solving
problems, Commander.

228
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,549
And Enigma is the most
difficult problem in the world.

229
00:11:25,582 --> 00:11:27,985
No, Enigma isn't difficult;
It's impossible.

230
00:11:28,018 --> 00:11:30,488
The Americans, the Russians,
the French,

231
00:11:30,521 --> 00:11:32,957
the Germans,
everyone thinks Enigma

232
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,125
is unbreakable.

233
00:11:34,158 --> 00:11:35,393
Good.

234
00:11:35,426 --> 00:11:37,528
Let me try,
and we'll know for sure,

235
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:39,063
won't we?

236
00:11:40,564 --> 00:11:42,901
DENNISTON: Welcome to Enigma.

237
00:11:44,601 --> 00:11:47,538
The details of every
surprise attack,

238
00:11:47,571 --> 00:11:51,042
every secret convoy

239
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:53,577
and every U-boat in
the bloody Atlantic

240
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,546
go into that thing.

241
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:59,016
And out comes gibberish.

242
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:01,619
It's beautiful.

243
00:12:01,652 --> 00:12:04,388
DENNISTON: It's the crooked
hand of death itself.

244
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:08,859
Our Wrens intercept thousands
of radio messages a day,

245
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:10,928
and to the lovely young ladies

246
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:12,997
of the Women's Royal Navy,
they're nonsense.

247
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,334
It's only when you feed
them back into Enigma

248
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:18,636
that they make any sense.

249
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:19,804
But we have an Enigma machine.

250
00:12:19,837 --> 00:12:21,272
Yes, Polish Intelligence

251
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:22,506
smuggled it out of Berlin.

252
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:23,574
So what's the problem?

253
00:12:23,607 --> 00:12:24,742
Just put
the intercepted messages

254
00:12:24,775 --> 00:12:26,043
back into the Enigma
and you'll...

255
00:12:26,076 --> 00:12:28,980
Look, it's not
that simple, is it?

256
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:31,215
Just having an Enigma machine

257
00:12:31,248 --> 00:12:32,917
doesn't help you to decode
the messages.

258
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,987
DENNISTON: Very good, Mr. Turing.

259
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,856
To decode a message, you need to
know the machine's settings.

260
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:41,592
Now, the Germans switch settings

261
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,861
every day promptly at midnight.

262
00:12:43,894 --> 00:12:45,096
We usually intercept

263
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:47,365
our first message
around 6:00 a.m.,

264
00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:48,966
which gives you exactly

265
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:53,004
18 hours every day
to crack the code

266
00:12:53,037 --> 00:12:55,539
before it changes,
and you start again.

267
00:12:55,572 --> 00:12:57,174
Five rotors.

268
00:12:57,207 --> 00:12:59,076
Ten plugboard cables.

269
00:12:59,109 --> 00:13:00,711
- That's... -One million...
- A thousand million...

270
00:13:00,744 --> 00:13:02,380
No, no, it's, uh, I've got it.

271
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:04,882
- It's million, million.
- It's in the millions, obviously.

272
00:13:04,915 --> 00:13:08,219
It's over 150 million million
million possible settings.

273
00:13:08,252 --> 00:13:09,420
Very good.

274
00:13:09,453 --> 00:13:11,922
159.

275
00:13:11,955 --> 00:13:14,492
If you want to be
exact about it. 1-5-9

276
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:16,761
with 18 zeroes behind it.

277
00:13:16,794 --> 00:13:18,496
Possibilities.

278
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:20,231
Every single day.

279
00:13:20,264 --> 00:13:23,000
DENNISTON: Gentlemen, meet Hugh Alexander.

280
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:24,802
I personally selected him

281
00:13:24,835 --> 00:13:27,138
- to run this unit.
- Didn't you...

282
00:13:27,171 --> 00:13:29,507
Mr. Alexander won Britain's
national chess championship.

283
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,975
Twice.

284
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:32,329
DENNISTON: You're not the only one

285
00:13:32,342 --> 00:13:33,844
who's good at games
around here, Turing.

286
00:13:33,877 --> 00:13:36,647
Are-are we
to work together, then?

287
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,883
I prefer to have my own office.

288
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,851
You're a team,
and you will work as one.

289
00:13:40,884 --> 00:13:43,487
I-I-I don't have time
to explain myself as I go along,

290
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,089
and I'm afraid these men

291
00:13:45,122 --> 00:13:47,358
- would only slow me down.

292
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,761
play together, then I'm afraid
we can't let you play at all.

293
00:13:50,794 --> 00:13:52,363
This is Stewart Menzies, MI6.

294
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:54,799
There are only five divisions
of military intelligence.

295
00:13:54,832 --> 00:13:57,034
There is no MI6.

296
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,469
Exactly.

297
00:13:58,502 --> 00:14:00,805
That's the spirit.

298
00:14:00,838 --> 00:14:03,007
Mr. Turing, do you know
how many British servicemen

299
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,208
have died because of Enigma?

300
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:06,277
Uh, no, I don't.

301
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,313
Three... while we've been having

302
00:14:09,346 --> 00:14:11,449
this conversation.

303
00:14:12,749 --> 00:14:15,019
Oh, look, there's another.

304
00:14:15,052 --> 00:14:17,254
I rather hope he
didn't have a family.

305
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:20,858
This war Commander Denniston's
been going on about,

306
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:22,793
we're not winning it.

307
00:14:22,826 --> 00:14:27,631
Break the code, at least
we have a chance.

308
00:14:27,664 --> 00:14:30,501
Shall we leave
the children alone

309
00:14:30,534 --> 00:14:32,269
with their new toy?

310
00:14:32,302 --> 00:14:33,504
Hm.

311
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,611
All right, gentlemen...

312
00:14:40,644 --> 00:14:43,748
- Let's play.

313
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,987
TURING VOICE-OVER:
The game was quite a simple one.

314
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:55,359
Every single German message,
every surprise attack,

315
00:14:55,392 --> 00:14:57,027
every bombing run,

316
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,763
every imminent U-boat assault...

317
00:14:59,796 --> 00:15:02,100

318
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:08,372
They were all floating
through the air.

319
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:15,179

320
00:15:17,748 --> 00:15:19,650
Radio signals that...

321
00:15:19,683 --> 00:15:22,820
well, any schoolboy
with an AM kit

322
00:15:22,853 --> 00:15:24,588
could intercept.

323
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:26,290

324
00:15:26,323 --> 00:15:30,194
The trick was
that they were encrypted.

325
00:15:40,237 --> 00:15:43,941
There were 159 million
million million possible.

326
00:15:43,974 --> 00:15:45,843
Enigma settings.

327
00:15:45,876 --> 00:15:48,446
All we had to do
was try each one.

328
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:55,352
But if we had ten men checking
one setting a minute

329
00:15:55,385 --> 00:15:59,056
for 24 hours every day
and seven days every week,

330
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:02,860
how many days do you think
it would take to, uh,

331
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:06,564
to check each of the settings?

332
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:11,535
Well, it's not days, it's years.

333
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:13,070
Good morning.

334
00:16:13,103 --> 00:16:17,007
It's 20 million years.

335
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,943
- To stop a coming attack,
- Thank you.

336
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:22,446
We would have to check
20 million years' worth

337
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:26,884
of settings in 20 minutes.

338
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:45,069

339
00:16:47,938 --> 00:16:51,042

340
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:54,245
I'm famished.

341
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:56,080
Lunch?

342
00:16:56,113 --> 00:16:57,748
ALEXANDER: Good Lord. What is it

343
00:16:57,781 --> 00:17:00,017
about women with little hats?

344
00:17:06,356 --> 00:17:10,394
The boys, we're going
to get some lunch.

345
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,299
Alan?

346
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:16,767
Yes?

347
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,603
I said we're going
to get some lunch.

348
00:17:21,238 --> 00:17:22,706
Alan?

349
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:23,774
Yes?

350
00:17:23,807 --> 00:17:25,242
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.

351
00:17:25,275 --> 00:17:28,579
I said we're off to get some lu...

352
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:30,948
This is starting to get
a little bit repetitive.

353
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:32,383
- What is?
- I had asked

354
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,051
if you wanted to come
to lunch with us.

355
00:17:34,084 --> 00:17:35,486
Um, no, you didn't.

356
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:37,955
You said you were going
to get some lunch.

357
00:17:37,988 --> 00:17:40,057
Have I offended you in some way?

358
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,325
Why would you think that?

359
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:43,994
Would you like to come to lunch
with us?

360
00:17:44,027 --> 00:17:46,030
- What time's lunchtime?
- Christ, Alan,

361
00:17:46,063 --> 00:17:47,164
it's a bleeding sandwich.

362
00:17:47,197 --> 00:17:49,166
- What is?
- Lunch.

363
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:51,068
Oh, I don't like sandwiches.

364
00:17:51,101 --> 00:17:52,569
Never mind.

365
00:17:52,602 --> 00:17:54,171
You know,

366
00:17:54,204 --> 00:17:56,473
to pull off
this irascible genius routine,

367
00:17:56,506 --> 00:17:58,509
one actually has to be
a genius, Alan.

368
00:17:58,542 --> 00:17:59,843
And yet we're the ones

369
00:17:59,876 --> 00:18:01,312
making progress here, aren't we?

370
00:18:01,345 --> 00:18:02,579
Oh, you are?

371
00:18:02,612 --> 00:18:04,481
Yes, we are.

372
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:08,085
We have decrypted a number
of German messages

373
00:18:08,118 --> 00:18:11,422
by analyzing the frequency
of letter distribution.

374
00:18:12,055 --> 00:18:14,724
Oh, even a broken clock
is right twice a day.

375
00:18:14,757 --> 00:18:16,760
That-That's not progress;
That's just blind luck.

376
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:17,795
I'm designing a machine

377
00:18:18,428 --> 00:18:20,964
that will allow us
to break every message

378
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:25,002
every day instantly.

379
00:18:26,102 --> 00:18:27,638
Who's hungry?

380
00:18:28,338 --> 00:18:29,773
Let's go.

381
00:18:29,806 --> 00:18:31,041
I'm hungry.

382
00:18:32,142 --> 00:18:33,577
What?

383
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,679
TURING: Peter asked who was hungry.

384
00:18:35,712 --> 00:18:37,314
Can I have some soup, please?

385
00:18:37,347 --> 00:18:39,683

386
00:18:41,151 --> 00:18:42,953

387
00:18:42,986 --> 00:18:44,421

388
00:18:44,454 --> 00:18:46,056

389
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,703

390
00:19:15,785 --> 00:19:17,988

391
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,550
Another break
in the circuit there.

392
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,703
What do you mean, "classified"?

393
00:20:06,736 --> 00:20:09,706
No, I'm aware of the literal
meaning of the word classified.

394
00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:11,775
What I'm asking is why would
a maths professor

395
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:14,745
have his military records
classified?

396
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:18,449
Yeah, well, I will come down.

397
00:20:21,684 --> 00:20:25,723
WPC: Sorry, can I get you
to hold for a minute, please?

398
00:20:34,063 --> 00:20:36,800

399
00:20:38,468 --> 00:20:41,104
Pardon me, I'd like to see
some documents, if I may.

400
00:20:41,137 --> 00:20:44,674
Service records of a Mr. Turing.

401
00:20:44,707 --> 00:20:45,642
Alan.

402
00:20:45,675 --> 00:20:48,445
Foreign Office sent me.

403
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:52,182

404
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,720
This is unacceptable.

405
00:20:56,753 --> 00:20:58,755
If you wish to discuss
the complaint,

406
00:20:58,788 --> 00:21:00,257
I suggest you make
a proper appointment.

407
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,559
Alexan... Complaint?

408
00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:03,960
No, no, Hugh Alexander

409
00:21:03,993 --> 00:21:06,696
has denied my requisition
for parts

410
00:21:06,729 --> 00:21:08,865
and-and equipment that I need to
build the machine I've designed.

411
00:21:08,898 --> 00:21:10,901
Your fellow code-breakers
are refusing to work with you,

412
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:12,469
and they filed
a formal complaint.

413
00:21:12,502 --> 00:21:14,304
It's is inspired
by an old Polish code machine.

414
00:21:14,337 --> 00:21:17,240
Only this one is
infinitely more advanced.

415
00:21:17,273 --> 00:21:18,608
If you don't respond
to the complaint,

416
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:20,477
I shall have to take it up
with the Home Office.

417
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,812
Put those files by my desk.

418
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:23,513
Fine, my response is
they're all idiots.

419
00:21:23,546 --> 00:21:25,582
Fire them and use the savings
to fund my machine.

420
00:21:25,615 --> 00:21:28,819
I only need
about 100,000 pounds.

421
00:21:29,886 --> 00:21:31,155
100,000...

422
00:21:32,522 --> 00:21:34,090
Why are you building a machine?

423
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:37,594
You wouldn't understand.

424
00:21:37,627 --> 00:21:40,497
I suggest you make
the effort to try.

425
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,500
Enigma is...

426
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:45,235
an extremely
well-designed machine.

427
00:21:45,268 --> 00:21:48,471
Our problem is that we're only
using men to try to beat it.

428
00:21:48,504 --> 00:21:50,540
No, what if only a machine

429
00:21:50,573 --> 00:21:53,176
can defeat another machine?

430
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:54,678
Well, that's not very technical.

431
00:21:54,711 --> 00:21:56,012
Hugh Alexander is in charge

432
00:21:56,045 --> 00:21:58,615
of your unit; He said no,
and that is that.

433
00:21:58,648 --> 00:22:00,383
I simply don't have time
for this.

434
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:03,386
Have you ever won a war, Turing?

435
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,422
I have.

436
00:22:05,455 --> 00:22:07,290
Do you know how it's done?

437
00:22:07,323 --> 00:22:10,026
Order, discipline,
chain of command.

438
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:11,862
You're not at university
any longer.

439
00:22:11,895 --> 00:22:15,332
You are a very small cog
in a very large system.

440
00:22:15,365 --> 00:22:18,335
And you will do as your
commanding officer instructs.

441
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,303
Yes.

442
00:22:20,336 --> 00:22:21,938

443
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:25,442
Who-who is
your commanding officer?

444
00:22:25,475 --> 00:22:27,444
Winston Churchill,

445
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:30,513
Number 10 Downing
Street, London, SW1.

446
00:22:30,546 --> 00:22:32,415
You have a problem
with my decision,

447
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,918
you can take it up with him.

448
00:22:39,722 --> 00:22:41,524
TURING VOICE-OVER: Mr. Menzies!

449
00:22:41,557 --> 00:22:44,794
Mr. Menzies!

450
00:22:44,827 --> 00:22:48,365
A-A-Are you going to London?

451
00:22:48,398 --> 00:22:50,300
Possibly.

452
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:54,037
Would you deliver
a letter for me?

453
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:00,644
ALEXANDER VOICE-OVER: Look, I'm sorry,

454
00:23:00,677 --> 00:23:02,279
but are you joking?

455
00:23:02,312 --> 00:23:04,147
Churchill's put Alan in charge?

456
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,917
- This is a terrible idea.
- No, no, no, no, no.

457
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,619
So I can give these
men orders now?

458
00:23:09,652 --> 00:23:11,621
I hate to say it, but yes.

459
00:23:11,654 --> 00:23:13,924
Excellent. Keith and Charles,
you're both fired.

460
00:23:14,757 --> 00:23:16,293
- Excuse me?
- What?

461
00:23:16,326 --> 00:23:17,594
You're mediocre linguists,

462
00:23:17,627 --> 00:23:20,030
and positively
poor code-breakers.

463
00:23:20,063 --> 00:23:21,731
Alan, you can't just
fire Keith and Charles.

464
00:23:21,764 --> 00:23:23,400
Well, he just said I could.

465
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:24,701
No, I did no such thing.

466
00:23:24,734 --> 00:23:26,670
But Churchill did.

467
00:23:33,576 --> 00:23:36,012

468
00:23:36,045 --> 00:23:38,148
Go to hell.

469
00:23:42,452 --> 00:23:46,489
Well, this is inhuman.

470
00:23:46,522 --> 00:23:48,292
Even for you.

471
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:55,198
Popular at school, were you?

472
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,439
TURING VOICE-OVER:
The problem began, of course,

473
00:24:02,472 --> 00:24:04,574
with the carrots.

474
00:24:04,607 --> 00:24:06,609
Carrots are orange.

475
00:24:06,642 --> 00:24:09,512
And peas are green.

476
00:24:09,545 --> 00:24:11,748
They mustn't touch.

477
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:24,761

478
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,530

479
00:24:28,531 --> 00:24:30,367

480
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,269
I got it.

481
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:36,718
TURING VOICE-OVER: Do you know why people

482
00:24:36,739 --> 00:24:37,941
like violence?

483
00:24:37,974 --> 00:24:42,312
It is because it feels... good.

484
00:24:42,345 --> 00:24:46,750
Humans find violence
deeply satisfying.

485
00:24:46,783 --> 00:24:50,553
But remove the-the satisfaction,

486
00:24:50,586 --> 00:24:53,523
and the act becomes...

487
00:24:53,556 --> 00:24:56,326
- Hollow.

488
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:58,662

489
00:25:01,564 --> 00:25:04,067
STUDENT: Turing?

490
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,002
Come on.

491
00:25:06,035 --> 00:25:07,604
Don't be such a kike about it.

492
00:25:07,637 --> 00:25:09,739

493
00:25:09,772 --> 00:25:11,942
STUDENT 2: Leave him to bloody rot.

494
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:19,149
TURING VOICE-OVER:
I didn't learn this on my own,

495
00:25:19,182 --> 00:25:20,617
of course.

496
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,851
I had help.

497
00:25:21,884 --> 00:25:25,789
Christopher helped.

498
00:25:26,756 --> 00:25:28,291
Alan, are you all right?

499
00:25:28,324 --> 00:25:29,726

500
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:32,996

501
00:25:34,864 --> 00:25:36,533
It's not my fault.

502
00:25:36,566 --> 00:25:39,469
The carrots got in
with the peas and...

503
00:25:39,502 --> 00:25:40,703
I'm sorry.

504
00:25:40,736 --> 00:25:41,971
I won't let them do it again.

505
00:25:42,004 --> 00:25:43,540
They're getting worse.

506
00:25:43,573 --> 00:25:46,242
They only beat me up because
I'm smarter than they are.

507
00:25:46,275 --> 00:25:48,778
No, they beat you up
because you're different.

508
00:25:48,811 --> 00:25:51,181
Mother says
I'm just an odd duck.

509
00:25:51,214 --> 00:25:53,316
And she's right.

510
00:25:53,349 --> 00:25:55,051
But you know, Alan,

511
00:25:55,084 --> 00:25:58,188
sometimes it's the very people
who no one imagines anything of

512
00:25:58,221 --> 00:26:00,957
who do the things
no one can imagine.

513
00:26:07,363 --> 00:26:10,033
So, what do we do now?

514
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:12,368
We're short on staff.

515
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:13,837
TURING: Well, we, uh, we get

516
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,071
more staff then.

517
00:26:15,104 --> 00:26:17,407
And how do you propose
to do that?

518
00:26:38,594 --> 00:26:40,931

519
00:26:51,974 --> 00:26:53,910

520
00:26:53,943 --> 00:26:55,778

521
00:26:55,811 --> 00:26:58,415

522
00:27:12,828 --> 00:27:15,432

523
00:27:23,673 --> 00:27:25,509

524
00:27:37,386 --> 00:27:39,389

525
00:27:39,422 --> 00:27:41,525

526
00:27:59,575 --> 00:28:01,912

527
00:28:18,494 --> 00:28:20,530

528
00:28:36,912 --> 00:28:39,249

529
00:28:45,621 --> 00:28:49,492
Um, Alan Turing to
see Stewart Menzies.

530
00:28:49,525 --> 00:28:50,860
Very good, sir.

531
00:28:50,893 --> 00:28:52,996
MENZIES VOICE-OVER: So who are they?

532
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:54,564
Oh, all sorts, really.

533
00:28:54,597 --> 00:28:56,432
Teacher, an engineer,

534
00:28:56,465 --> 00:28:57,934
a handful of students.

535
00:28:57,967 --> 00:28:59,469
And you think they're
qualified for Bletchley

536
00:28:59,502 --> 00:29:01,304
'cause they're good
at crossword puzzles?

537
00:29:01,337 --> 00:29:03,673
Well, they say they're good,
and now we shall find out,

538
00:29:03,706 --> 00:29:05,108
won't we?

539
00:29:05,141 --> 00:29:06,743
VOICE-OVER: In order to aid your efforts,

540
00:29:06,776 --> 00:29:09,646
there is, to the right of you,
a green scratch card book.

541
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:10,447
You are to make notes in that.

542
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,015
Gentlemen, you have six minutes

543
00:29:12,048 --> 00:29:14,351
in which to complete the
puzzle, at which point,

544
00:29:14,384 --> 00:29:15,719
I will...

545
00:29:18,288 --> 00:29:19,389
Pardon, ma'am,
this room's restricted.

546
00:29:19,422 --> 00:29:21,058
Oh, apologies for my tardiness.

547
00:29:21,091 --> 00:29:22,192
The-the bus caught a flat tire.

548
00:29:22,225 --> 00:29:24,661
Uh, may I continue, please?

549
00:29:24,694 --> 00:29:26,630
Thank you. -You're not
allowed in here, ma'am.

550
00:29:26,663 --> 00:29:28,498
Oh, but I'm only
a few minutes late.

551
00:29:28,531 --> 00:29:30,367
The secretaries are
to head upstairs.

552
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,835
This room's for the candidates.

553
00:29:31,868 --> 00:29:34,204
May I get on with
this now, please?

554
00:29:34,237 --> 00:29:36,540
I-I am a candidate.

555
00:29:36,573 --> 00:29:37,773
- For what position?

556
00:29:37,774 --> 00:29:39,209
The letter didn't say precisely.

557
00:29:39,242 --> 00:29:40,544
Yeah, so secretaries
are to head upstairs.

558
00:29:40,577 --> 00:29:42,412
It did say
that it was top secret.

559
00:29:42,445 --> 00:29:44,181
What is going on?

560
00:29:44,214 --> 00:29:45,415
I-I solved

561
00:29:45,448 --> 00:29:47,150
a-a crossword puzzle
in the newspaper,

562
00:29:47,183 --> 00:29:48,685
and I-I got this letter saying

563
00:29:48,718 --> 00:29:51,154
that I was a candidate for
some sort of mysterious job.

564
00:29:51,187 --> 00:29:52,689
My name's Joan Clarke.

565
00:29:52,722 --> 00:29:56,860
Miss, did you really solve
this puzzle yourself?

566
00:29:58,228 --> 00:30:00,430
What makes you think I couldn't
solve the puzzle myself?

567
00:30:00,463 --> 00:30:01,983
- I-I'm really very good at...
- Ma'am,

568
00:30:01,998 --> 00:30:03,533
- I'll have to ask you to...
- Miss Clarke,

569
00:30:03,566 --> 00:30:04,968
I-I find tardiness

570
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:10,040
under any circumstance,
um, unacceptable.

571
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:15,546
Take a seat so that
we may continue.

572
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,683
SOFTLY: Thank you.

573
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,518
TURING: Now, um,

574
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:23,687
as I was saying,
you-you have six minutes

575
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,023
to, uh, complete the task
in front of you.

576
00:30:27,056 --> 00:30:32,730
Uh, gentlemen and lady, begin.

577
00:30:50,413 --> 00:30:52,750

578
00:30:59,355 --> 00:31:02,125
Six minutes.

579
00:31:02,158 --> 00:31:03,426
Is that even possible?

580
00:31:03,459 --> 00:31:05,595
No, it takes me eight.

581
00:31:05,628 --> 00:31:07,564
This isn't about
crossword puzzles.

582
00:31:07,597 --> 00:31:08,932
It's about how one, uh,

583
00:31:08,965 --> 00:31:10,834
approaches solving an
impossible problem.

584
00:31:10,867 --> 00:31:14,070
Do you tackle the whole thing
at once or divide it

585
00:31:14,103 --> 00:31:18,241
into small... You've finished?

586
00:31:18,274 --> 00:31:20,611
Yes.

587
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:36,159
Five minutes and 34 seconds.

588
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:39,429
You said to do it in under six.

589
00:31:39,462 --> 00:31:41,164
MENZIES VOICE-OVER: Congratulations.

590
00:31:41,197 --> 00:31:44,267
My warmest welcome to
His Majesty's service.

591
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,770
If you speak a word
of what I'm about to show you,

592
00:31:46,803 --> 00:31:49,072
you will be executed
for high treason.

593
00:31:49,806 --> 00:31:51,374
You will lie to your friends,

594
00:31:51,407 --> 00:31:53,443
your family
and everyone you meet

595
00:31:53,476 --> 00:31:56,046
about what it is you really do.

596
00:31:57,046 --> 00:31:59,950
And what is it
that we're really doing?

597
00:31:59,983 --> 00:32:02,219
We're going to break
an unbreakable Nazi code

598
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:04,020
and win the war.

599
00:32:04,053 --> 00:32:06,356
Oh.

600
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:08,391

601
00:32:08,424 --> 00:32:10,661

602
00:32:15,331 --> 00:32:18,134
What's that you're reading?

603
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:20,470
It's about cryptography.

604
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:22,205
Like secret messages?

605
00:32:22,238 --> 00:32:24,441
Not secret.

606
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:26,209
That's the brilliant part.

607
00:32:26,242 --> 00:32:29,679
Messages that anyone can see,
but no one knows what they mean

608
00:32:29,712 --> 00:32:32,015
unless you have the key.

609
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,023
How's that different
from talking?

610
00:32:40,056 --> 00:32:42,292
- Talking?
- When people talk to each other,

611
00:32:42,325 --> 00:32:43,593
they never say what they mean.

612
00:32:43,626 --> 00:32:44,995
They say something else,

613
00:32:45,028 --> 00:32:47,664
and you're expected to
just know what they mean.

614
00:32:47,697 --> 00:32:50,333
Only I never do.

615
00:32:50,366 --> 00:32:54,171
So, how's that different?

616
00:32:55,238 --> 00:32:56,640
Alan, I have a funny feeling

617
00:32:56,673 --> 00:32:58,942
you're going to be
very good at this.

618
00:33:14,424 --> 00:33:16,260

619
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,236
Good night, Alan.

620
00:33:30,606 --> 00:33:32,910
Good night.

621
00:33:44,587 --> 00:33:46,923
WOMAN: Hold on,
Marion, I'm coming!

622
00:33:46,956 --> 00:33:48,992
Coming round the lesser settings
and then route back through...

623
00:33:49,025 --> 00:33:50,760
- Back to those ones...

624
00:33:50,793 --> 00:33:52,729
Uh, careful, will you?

625
00:33:52,762 --> 00:33:54,431
Um, it-it's not a toy.

626
00:33:54,464 --> 00:33:56,099
ALEXANDER: Funny.

627
00:33:56,132 --> 00:33:57,000
Looks like a toy.

628
00:33:57,033 --> 00:33:59,636
Bloody great 100,000-pound one.

629
00:33:59,669 --> 00:34:01,471
Your new minion's arrived.

630
00:34:01,504 --> 00:34:02,739
Jack Good. We met...

631
00:34:02,772 --> 00:34:05,375
Well, where's Miss Clarke?

632
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,512
Lovely, isn't he?

633
00:34:09,545 --> 00:34:14,718
TURING: It's not just a-a usual
humdrum production mill factory.

634
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:15,986
I mean, well,
as-as I was saying,

635
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:19,556
it's a very important,
uh, radio factory.

636
00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:21,858
I-It's not, actually.
Uh, well, um,

637
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:24,527
on the spectrum of,
uh... radio factories,

638
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,631
this-this one
is-is particularly...

639
00:34:31,134 --> 00:34:33,069

640
00:34:33,102 --> 00:34:35,072

641
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,976
Why are you not at Bletchley?

642
00:34:40,009 --> 00:34:43,046
Thank you... so much for
your visit, Mr. Turing.

643
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:45,281
Was your trip pleasant? -Gather
your things and let's go.

644
00:34:45,314 --> 00:34:48,551
I'm sorry, but I'm unable
to accept your offer.

645
00:34:48,584 --> 00:34:50,620
We feel that such a position

646
00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:52,188
would hardly be appropriate.

647
00:34:52,221 --> 00:34:54,457
You earned a double first
in mathematics.

648
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:57,660
But sadly wasn't granted the
opportunity to become a Fellow.

649
00:34:57,693 --> 00:34:59,662
You belong at Bletchley.

650
00:34:59,695 --> 00:35:02,399
JOAN: I'm sorry,
but for someone in my position

651
00:35:02,432 --> 00:35:04,634
to live... to...

652
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:07,670
to work in a radio factory
so far from home,

653
00:35:07,703 --> 00:35:12,308
with all your men, um...
it-it would be...

654
00:35:12,341 --> 00:35:14,277
indecorous.

655
00:35:15,278 --> 00:35:18,348
What in the world
does that even mean?

656
00:35:19,182 --> 00:35:22,852

657
00:35:22,885 --> 00:35:25,255
We have a group of,
uh, young ladies

658
00:35:25,288 --> 00:35:26,923
who tend to all of our

659
00:35:26,956 --> 00:35:29,826
CLERICAL TASKS: Assistants, translators.

660
00:35:29,859 --> 00:35:32,262
Uh, they live,
um, together in town.

661
00:35:32,295 --> 00:35:36,733
W-W-Would that be a more,
uh, suitable environment?

662
00:35:36,766 --> 00:35:41,004
Hm. So-so I would be working
amongst these women?

663
00:35:41,037 --> 00:35:42,739
Yes.

664
00:35:44,574 --> 00:35:47,610
Wonderful ladies. Uh, they
even organize social events

665
00:35:47,643 --> 00:35:50,013
at St. Martin's Church
down the road.

666
00:35:50,046 --> 00:35:52,515
Uh, really, the whole thing
is-is quite, uh...

667
00:35:52,548 --> 00:35:56,453
uh, um... decorous.

668
00:35:58,855 --> 00:36:00,323

669
00:36:00,356 --> 00:36:02,192
Now, you won't have proper
security clearance,

670
00:36:02,225 --> 00:36:05,428
of course, so, uh, we'll have
to improvise things a bit.

671
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:06,796
Why are you helping me?

672
00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:08,865
Because there is only
one thing that matters

673
00:36:08,898 --> 00:36:11,067
in this entire world right
now... do you understand?...

674
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,769
and that is breaking Enigma.

675
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:15,872
But-but, Mr. Turing...

676
00:36:15,905 --> 00:36:18,241
why are you helping me?

677
00:36:18,274 --> 00:36:21,244
Oh. Um...

678
00:36:21,277 --> 00:36:24,781
sometimes it's the very people
who no one imagines anything of

679
00:36:24,814 --> 00:36:28,885
who do the things that
no one can imagine.

680
00:36:30,086 --> 00:36:32,255

681
00:36:46,636 --> 00:36:48,438
Sir.

682
00:36:48,471 --> 00:36:52,909
What's this? -Alan Turing's
classified military file.

683
00:36:52,942 --> 00:36:56,079
- It's bloody empty.
- Exactly.

684
00:36:56,112 --> 00:36:59,249
- It's an empty manila envelope.
- Yeah.

685
00:36:59,282 --> 00:37:02,285
Well, you've cracked the case
wide open, then, haven't you?

686
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:04,821
Alan Turing's war records
aren't just classified,

687
00:37:04,854 --> 00:37:06,656
they're nonexistent.

688
00:37:06,689 --> 00:37:08,725
That means someone's
got rid of them.

689
00:37:08,758 --> 00:37:10,293
Erased them. Burned them.

690
00:37:10,326 --> 00:37:14,064
And that same person broke into
his house and stole nothing?

691
00:37:15,097 --> 00:37:17,267
Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean.

692
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,968
What, the spies from the papers?

693
00:37:19,001 --> 00:37:20,336
The Soviet spies.

694
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:23,973
But first they were
professors, weren't they?

695
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:26,009
Radicalized at Cambridge,

696
00:37:26,042 --> 00:37:27,377
then they joined
the Communist Party,

697
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,479
then Foreign Office,
then leaked information

698
00:37:29,512 --> 00:37:31,214
to Stalin during the war... now,

699
00:37:31,247 --> 00:37:33,683
can you think of anyone else
we know who was at Cambridge,

700
00:37:33,716 --> 00:37:36,953
then took up something murky and
top secret when war broke out?

701
00:37:36,986 --> 00:37:40,256
You think this Alan Turing
might be a Soviet agent?

702
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:41,291
I think...

703
00:37:41,324 --> 00:37:43,660
something very serious
is happening

704
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:46,229
right here under our noses.

705
00:37:46,262 --> 00:37:49,499
Wouldn't you like to find out what it is?

706
00:37:51,767 --> 00:37:54,137

707
00:38:09,852 --> 00:38:13,223

708
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,665
Welcome, ladies.

709
00:38:22,698 --> 00:38:24,400
If you'd like to follow me.

710
00:38:24,433 --> 00:38:27,303
TURING VOICE-OVER: Some
people thought we were at war

711
00:38:27,336 --> 00:38:29,872
with the Germans... incorrect.

712
00:38:29,905 --> 00:38:32,208
We were at war with the clock.

713
00:38:32,241 --> 00:38:35,044
Britain was literally
starving to death.

714
00:38:35,077 --> 00:38:36,713
The Americans sent over

715
00:38:36,746 --> 00:38:40,516
100,000 tons of food every week,
and, uh, every week

716
00:38:40,549 --> 00:38:43,519
the Germans would send
our desperately needed bread

717
00:38:43,552 --> 00:38:45,088
to the bottom of the ocean.

718
00:38:45,121 --> 00:38:49,325
Our daily failure was announced
at the chimes of midnight.

719
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:53,596
And the sound would haunt
our unwelcome dreams.

720
00:38:53,629 --> 00:38:57,400
Tick... tock... tick.

721
00:38:57,433 --> 00:39:00,170

722
00:39:02,872 --> 00:39:04,641
Damn it!

723
00:39:06,876 --> 00:39:09,412
- What just happened?
- CAIRNCROSS: Midnight...

724
00:39:09,445 --> 00:39:11,914
all the work we've done
today is useless.

725
00:39:11,947 --> 00:39:14,284
Oh, but don't worry,
we've a few hours

726
00:39:14,317 --> 00:39:16,819
before tomorrow's messages
start flooding in...

727
00:39:16,852 --> 00:39:19,356
and we start all over again.

728
00:39:20,556 --> 00:39:21,991
From scratch.

729
00:39:22,024 --> 00:39:23,293
ALEXANDER: I'm so sick of this.

730
00:39:23,326 --> 00:39:26,095
Four hours rewiring
his plugboard matrix.

731
00:39:26,128 --> 00:39:27,563
Three hours yesterday

732
00:39:27,596 --> 00:39:29,432
on his rotor positions!

733
00:39:29,465 --> 00:39:32,368
- Don't go over there.
- Look, John, no.

734
00:39:32,401 --> 00:39:34,237
If this job wasn't
already impossible before,

735
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:37,340
- it bloody well is now.
- Hugh, don't.

736
00:39:37,373 --> 00:39:39,409

737
00:39:39,442 --> 00:39:41,211

738
00:39:44,914 --> 00:39:47,684
Damn you and your
useless machine.

739
00:39:47,717 --> 00:39:51,654
My machine is how we are going to win.

740
00:39:51,687 --> 00:39:53,089
Really?

741
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:56,592
This machine? Hmm?

742
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:59,162
Are you talking about
this bloody machine?!

743
00:39:59,195 --> 00:40:00,997
- Hugh! Hugh! Hugh, don't!
- Hugh! Hugh! Stop!

744
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,533
ALEXANDER: You arrogant bastard.

745
00:40:03,566 --> 00:40:04,967
You could help us.

746
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,503
You could make this go
faster, but you won't.

747
00:40:07,536 --> 00:40:09,272

748
00:40:09,305 --> 00:40:11,007
Get off.

749
00:40:13,008 --> 00:40:16,012

750
00:40:16,045 --> 00:40:18,581
He's right, Alan.

751
00:40:18,614 --> 00:40:20,516
There are...

752
00:40:20,549 --> 00:40:23,920
actual soldiers out there
trying to win an actual war.

753
00:40:23,953 --> 00:40:25,121
My brother

754
00:40:25,154 --> 00:40:27,857
protects food convoys
in the Navy.

755
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:30,626
My cousins fly RAF patrols.

756
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:33,262
All my friends,
they're all making a difference,

757
00:40:33,295 --> 00:40:37,133
while we just...
while away our days

758
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:39,569
producing nothing.

759
00:40:39,602 --> 00:40:42,339
Because of you.

760
00:40:43,172 --> 00:40:48,177
PANTING: My machine...
will work.

761
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,613
Come on, Peter.

762
00:41:10,499 --> 00:41:13,403

763
00:41:16,906 --> 00:41:20,209

764
00:41:20,242 --> 00:41:22,512

765
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:32,389
Okay.

766
00:41:33,622 --> 00:41:35,792

767
00:41:39,695 --> 00:41:42,298

768
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,772

769
00:41:49,805 --> 00:41:51,775

770
00:42:00,649 --> 00:42:02,819
WHISPERS: Joan?

771
00:42:05,921 --> 00:42:08,191

772
00:42:13,162 --> 00:42:15,231
SOFTLY: Oh.

773
00:42:16,098 --> 00:42:17,867

774
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:25,741
- Uh, will you...

775
00:42:25,774 --> 00:42:27,310

776
00:42:27,343 --> 00:42:30,079
- Could you make

777
00:42:30,112 --> 00:42:31,314
a bit more noise?
I'm not quite sure

778
00:42:31,347 --> 00:42:32,782
- my landlady woke up.
- Oh, sorry.

779
00:42:33,215 --> 00:42:34,951
Oh, uh, look.

780
00:42:34,984 --> 00:42:37,019
I think that's the
best I can do.

781
00:42:37,052 --> 00:42:38,688
No male visitors after dark.

782
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:42,892
So... what did you bring me?

783
00:42:42,925 --> 00:42:44,560
There you go.

784
00:42:44,593 --> 00:42:46,028
Here.

785
00:42:46,061 --> 00:42:48,698
Some men try flowers, you know.

786
00:42:48,731 --> 00:42:51,701
These are actual
decrypted Enigma messages

787
00:42:51,734 --> 00:42:53,202
direct from Nazi.

788
00:42:53,235 --> 00:42:54,737
High Command.

789
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:56,105
"0600 hours.

790
00:42:56,138 --> 00:42:57,974
"Weather today is clear.

791
00:42:58,007 --> 00:42:59,642
"Rain in the evening.

792
00:42:59,675 --> 00:43:00,843
Heil Hitler."

793
00:43:00,876 --> 00:43:02,945
Well, clearly,
that vital piece of information

794
00:43:02,978 --> 00:43:04,580
is going to win us the war.

795
00:43:04,613 --> 00:43:06,749
It's the relationship
between the encrypted

796
00:43:06,782 --> 00:43:09,652
a-and decrypted messages
that interests me.

797
00:43:09,685 --> 00:43:13,723
Can we find a clue here that
we can build into Christopher?

798
00:43:13,756 --> 00:43:14,924
Who's Christopher?

799
00:43:14,957 --> 00:43:17,093
Oh, he's, uh, he's my machine.

800
00:43:17,126 --> 00:43:18,794
You named him?

801
00:43:18,827 --> 00:43:21,497
Is that a bad name?

802
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,233
No.

803
00:43:24,266 --> 00:43:26,436
No, never mind.

804
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,911
Are you trying to build
your universal machine?

805
00:43:36,211 --> 00:43:37,713
I read your paper

806
00:43:37,746 --> 00:43:40,182
- at university.
- Is it already being taught?

807
00:43:40,215 --> 00:43:42,685
LAUGHS: No. No. No, I was precocious.

808
00:43:42,718 --> 00:43:46,289
So... you-you theorized
a machine that

809
00:43:46,322 --> 00:43:47,757
could solve any problem.

810
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,759
It didn't just do one thing,
it did everything.

811
00:43:49,792 --> 00:43:52,194
It wasn't just programmable,
it was reprogrammable.

812
00:43:52,227 --> 00:43:53,362
Mm.

813
00:43:53,395 --> 00:43:55,631
Is that your idea
behind Christopher?

814
00:43:55,664 --> 00:43:59,936
Well, human brains can compute
large sums very quickly...

815
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:03,406
even Hugh can do that... but I
want Christopher to be smarter.

816
00:44:03,439 --> 00:44:06,242
To make a calculation
and then, uh...

817
00:44:06,275 --> 00:44:08,844
to determine what to do next.

818
00:44:08,877 --> 00:44:11,147
Like a person does.

819
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,982
Think of it.

820
00:44:13,015 --> 00:44:14,917
Electrical brain.

821
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:17,753
A digital computer.

822
00:44:17,786 --> 00:44:19,856
Digital computer.

823
00:44:21,123 --> 00:44:23,025
Hmm.

824
00:44:23,058 --> 00:44:24,360

825
00:44:24,393 --> 00:44:27,697

826
00:44:34,637 --> 00:44:38,307
- What's going on?

827
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,775
What's happening?

828
00:44:39,808 --> 00:44:42,211
No. No, no. No, no, no!
Don't touch that!

829
00:44:42,244 --> 00:44:44,013
- Stay back.
- That's my desk.

830
00:44:44,046 --> 00:44:45,414
DENNISTON: Thank goodness.

831
00:44:45,447 --> 00:44:47,049
I'd hate to think
we were searching

832
00:44:47,082 --> 00:44:49,919
the wrong one. -What are
you doing? What's going on?

833
00:44:49,952 --> 00:44:53,255
There is a spy in
Bletchley Park.

834
00:44:53,288 --> 00:44:54,657
The Navy thinks that one of us

835
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,092
is a Soviet double agent, Alan.

836
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:57,994
Uh... why?

837
00:44:58,027 --> 00:45:01,831
Our boys intercepted this
on its way to Moscow.

838
00:45:01,864 --> 00:45:03,933
Look familiar?

839
00:45:07,169 --> 00:45:08,604
It's a Beale cipher.

840
00:45:08,637 --> 00:45:13,409
Encrypted with a phrase
from a book or a poem or...

841
00:45:17,379 --> 00:45:19,382

842
00:45:19,415 --> 00:45:23,085
You don't seriously think
I did this, do you?

843
00:45:23,118 --> 00:45:25,388
Double agents are such bastards.

844
00:45:25,421 --> 00:45:27,356
Isolated loners.

845
00:45:27,389 --> 00:45:30,092
No attachments to
friends or family.

846
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:32,361
Arrogant.

847
00:45:32,394 --> 00:45:34,631
Know anybody like that?

848
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:41,003
I... Hm, I know you
don't like me,

849
00:45:41,036 --> 00:45:45,408
but that does not
make me a Soviet spy.

850
00:45:45,441 --> 00:45:48,711
POLICEMAN: Nothing
out of the ordinary, sir.

851
00:45:48,744 --> 00:45:50,413
Really.

852
00:45:50,446 --> 00:45:51,914
Mm, all right.

853
00:45:54,316 --> 00:45:56,385
The Home Office may be
protecting you now,

854
00:45:56,418 --> 00:45:57,953
but sooner or later

855
00:45:57,986 --> 00:45:59,321
you will make a mistake.

856
00:45:59,354 --> 00:46:02,291
And I needn't bother firing you.

857
00:46:02,324 --> 00:46:05,795
They will hang you for treason.

858
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:16,472

859
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,517
Hello.

860
00:46:28,751 --> 00:46:31,320
I heard about what happened.

861
00:46:31,353 --> 00:46:35,291
It's all the girls in
Hut 3 can talk about.

862
00:46:35,324 --> 00:46:39,195
I have an idea
of what might cheer you up.

863
00:46:39,228 --> 00:46:41,130

864
00:46:41,163 --> 00:46:42,865
JOAN: So because no letter

865
00:46:42,898 --> 00:46:44,967
can be encoded as itself,
there's already a handful

866
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,670
of settings that can be
rejected at the outset.

867
00:46:51,907 --> 00:46:53,676
Is that your team?

868
00:46:53,709 --> 00:46:55,544
- Y-Yes.
- Shall we say hello?

869
00:46:55,577 --> 00:46:57,447
- No.
- Hello.

870
00:46:58,347 --> 00:47:00,450
I-I told you not t-to do that.

871
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:03,786
- Alan.
- Uh, Hugh, h-hello.

872
00:47:03,819 --> 00:47:05,721
- Didn't know you drank.
- He doesn't, really.

873
00:47:05,754 --> 00:47:07,523
He just sort of sips
at the foam.

874
00:47:07,556 --> 00:47:09,759
Well, I'll let you into a
little secret, Miss...?

875
00:47:09,792 --> 00:47:10,593
Clarke.

876
00:47:10,626 --> 00:47:12,161
- Miss Clarke.
- Please.

877
00:47:12,194 --> 00:47:14,096
Foam's my favorite part, too.

878
00:47:14,129 --> 00:47:15,331
Is it really?

879
00:47:15,364 --> 00:47:16,999
Come and join us for a drink?

880
00:47:17,032 --> 00:47:18,400
We'll be there in a moment.

881
00:47:18,433 --> 00:47:20,803
Miss Clarke.

882
00:47:22,704 --> 00:47:25,341

883
00:47:25,374 --> 00:47:27,309
Well, he likes you.

884
00:47:27,342 --> 00:47:33,115
- Yes.
- You... g-got him to like you.

885
00:47:33,148 --> 00:47:34,750
Yes.

886
00:47:34,783 --> 00:47:35,818
Why?

887
00:47:35,851 --> 00:47:37,887
Because I'm a woman
in a man's job,

888
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,823
and I don't have the luxury
of being an ass.

889
00:47:40,856 --> 00:47:42,591
Alan...

890
00:47:42,624 --> 00:47:45,127
it doesn't matter
how smart you are,

891
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,263
Enigma is always smarter.

892
00:47:47,296 --> 00:47:50,299
If you really want to
solve your puzzle,

893
00:47:50,332 --> 00:47:52,434
then you're going to need
all the help

894
00:47:52,467 --> 00:47:54,570
you can get,
and they are not going

895
00:47:54,603 --> 00:47:58,274
to help you
if they do not like you.

896
00:47:58,307 --> 00:48:00,643

897
00:48:04,713 --> 00:48:08,117
- What are those?
- Apples.

898
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:10,219
- No.
- Oh, they really are.

899
00:48:10,252 --> 00:48:14,557
Um, I... well, Miss Clarke,
Joan actually, um...

900
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:16,525
said that it would be...

901
00:48:16,558 --> 00:48:19,295
nice if I was to, uh,
bring you all something.

902
00:48:19,328 --> 00:48:22,231
So here we are. I... Thank you.

903
00:48:22,264 --> 00:48:24,066
I like apples.

904
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:25,835
My best to Miss Clarke.

905
00:48:25,868 --> 00:48:28,170
Uh, there are two people
in a wood,

906
00:48:28,203 --> 00:48:30,139
and, um, they run into a bear.

907
00:48:30,172 --> 00:48:32,708
The first person
gets down on his knees to pray.

908
00:48:32,741 --> 00:48:34,743
The second person
starts lacing up his boots.

909
00:48:34,776 --> 00:48:36,545
The first person
asks the second person,

910
00:48:36,578 --> 00:48:38,280
"My dear friend,
what are you doing?

911
00:48:38,313 --> 00:48:39,849
You-you-you
can't outrun a bear."

912
00:48:39,882 --> 00:48:42,117
Uh, to which
the second person responds,

913
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:43,352
"I don't have to.

914
00:48:43,385 --> 00:48:46,756
I only have to outrun you."

915
00:48:55,764 --> 00:48:58,834
I'll be w-with Christopher,
if anyone needs me.

916
00:48:58,867 --> 00:49:01,937
MAN VOICE-OVER: If we assume
that the square root of two

917
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:05,441
is a rational number,
then we can say

918
00:49:05,474 --> 00:49:10,346
that the square root
of two is A over B...

919
00:49:10,379 --> 00:49:12,548
where A and B

920
00:49:12,581 --> 00:49:16,051
are whole numbers
and B is not zero.

921
00:49:16,084 --> 00:49:18,487
Mr. Turing,
passing notes, are we?

922
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,256
No, sir.

923
00:49:24,293 --> 00:49:29,632
Only Turing would pass notes
written in gibberish.

924
00:49:29,665 --> 00:49:31,534

925
00:49:34,736 --> 00:49:36,005
- All right, gentlemen,

926
00:49:36,038 --> 00:49:38,774
do not forget your algebra
over the break.

927
00:49:38,807 --> 00:49:42,578
Have a pleasant holiday,
and we'll resume

928
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:45,981
your irrationals
when you return.

929
00:49:46,014 --> 00:49:48,317

930
00:49:58,827 --> 00:50:01,964

931
00:50:06,168 --> 00:50:08,571

932
00:50:17,379 --> 00:50:19,048
Mm.

933
00:50:19,081 --> 00:50:20,683

934
00:50:20,716 --> 00:50:23,452
But Euler's Theorem
gives you that immediately.

935
00:50:23,485 --> 00:50:27,356
Um...

936
00:50:27,389 --> 00:50:29,658

937
00:50:29,691 --> 00:50:31,794

938
00:50:34,563 --> 00:50:36,732
Here. Look at this.

939
00:50:38,033 --> 00:50:41,704
If you run the wires across
the plugboard matrix diagonally,

940
00:50:41,737 --> 00:50:44,773
it will eliminate rotor
positions 500 times faster.

941
00:50:44,806 --> 00:50:47,009
That's, uh...

942
00:50:47,042 --> 00:50:50,012
actually not an entirely
terrible idea.

943
00:50:51,747 --> 00:50:54,250
I think that was Alan
for "thank you."

944
00:50:57,886 --> 00:50:59,521
Uh, th-that's my sandwich.

945
00:50:59,554 --> 00:51:02,057
You don't like sandwiches.

946
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:03,259

947
00:51:15,137 --> 00:51:17,340
You nervous?

948
00:51:23,378 --> 00:51:26,515

949
00:51:26,548 --> 00:51:28,817

950
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:31,954

951
00:51:39,861 --> 00:51:42,231
What happens now?

952
00:51:42,264 --> 00:51:46,435
It-it should work out the
day's Enigma settings.

953
00:51:47,602 --> 00:51:50,272

954
00:51:56,144 --> 00:51:59,181

955
00:52:01,416 --> 00:52:03,719
How long?

956
00:52:09,624 --> 00:52:13,162

957
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:20,135
CROWD VOICE-OVER: Sieg Heil!
Sieg Heil!

958
00:52:20,168 --> 00:52:23,072
NEWSMAN: The German Army
has fanned out across Europe,

959
00:52:23,105 --> 00:52:26,241
from Poland to Serbia,
Lithuania to Denmark,

960
00:52:26,274 --> 00:52:27,376
Norway to France.

961
00:52:27,409 --> 00:52:30,579
The Nazi flag now flies
from more than two dozen

962
00:52:30,612 --> 00:52:32,381
national capitals.

963
00:52:32,414 --> 00:52:34,083
Their campaign mounts in fury

964
00:52:34,116 --> 00:52:36,218
as a free Europe crumbles.

965
00:52:36,251 --> 00:52:39,488

966
00:52:39,521 --> 00:52:42,291

967
00:52:53,668 --> 00:52:56,505

968
00:53:05,547 --> 00:53:07,283

969
00:53:16,258 --> 00:53:18,961
MAN VOICE-OVER: Oh, it's still going.

970
00:53:18,994 --> 00:53:20,963
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning, Margaret.

971
00:53:20,996 --> 00:53:23,198
Gears keep spinning on and on.

972
00:53:23,231 --> 00:53:25,134
Rotors on and on.

973
00:53:25,167 --> 00:53:26,735
It's endless.

974
00:53:26,768 --> 00:53:29,538
With no result in sight?

975
00:53:29,571 --> 00:53:31,307
- No.

976
00:53:33,375 --> 00:53:36,311
Ow.

977
00:53:36,344 --> 00:53:39,515

978
00:53:39,548 --> 00:53:41,450

979
00:53:44,419 --> 00:53:46,088
Turing.

980
00:53:50,392 --> 00:53:53,496

981
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:00,802
- Turing, - open the bloody door.
- Uh, no.

982
00:54:00,835 --> 00:54:02,538
No.

983
00:54:03,772 --> 00:54:05,474
Open the door or
we'll break it down.

984
00:54:05,507 --> 00:54:09,578
I can't let you in! I-I...
I cannot let you interfere.

985
00:54:09,611 --> 00:54:11,247
Go on, then.

986
00:54:18,386 --> 00:54:19,888
Turn that thing off.

987
00:54:19,921 --> 00:54:22,758
No. Don't, please. Please.

988
00:54:22,791 --> 00:54:24,593
Please! Please!

989
00:54:24,626 --> 00:54:25,694
No!

990
00:54:25,727 --> 00:54:26,828
N-No. No!

991
00:54:26,861 --> 00:54:28,430
Don't!

992
00:54:28,463 --> 00:54:31,266

993
00:54:31,299 --> 00:54:33,902
Well, then, it seems
that your great big

994
00:54:33,935 --> 00:54:36,572
expensive machine doesn't work.

995
00:54:36,605 --> 00:54:37,839

996
00:54:37,872 --> 00:54:39,474
WHISPERS: It does.

997
00:54:39,507 --> 00:54:40,742
Wonderful.

998
00:54:40,775 --> 00:54:42,945
So you've broken Enigma, then?

999
00:54:42,978 --> 00:54:48,016
It was just... s-still working.

1000
00:54:48,049 --> 00:54:50,285
This is my associate
from the Home Office.

1001
00:54:50,318 --> 00:54:52,154
You see, a hundred
thousand pounds

1002
00:54:52,187 --> 00:54:54,089
is rather a lot of money,

1003
00:54:54,122 --> 00:54:57,259
and he's here to see what
you have to show for it.

1004
00:54:57,292 --> 00:55:00,796
You... will never understand

1005
00:55:00,829 --> 00:55:05,133
the importance of what
I-I am creating here!

1006
00:55:05,166 --> 00:55:08,670
Have you decrypted
any German messages?

1007
00:55:08,703 --> 00:55:11,273
A single one?

1008
00:55:11,306 --> 00:55:15,177
Can you point to anything
at all that you've achieved?

1009
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:18,647
Hmm. Your funding is up,

1010
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,983
and our patience is expired.

1011
00:55:21,016 --> 00:55:22,784
It's with such great pleasure

1012
00:55:22,817 --> 00:55:25,187
that I am finally
able to say this.

1013
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:28,824
Alan Turing, you're fired.

1014
00:55:28,857 --> 00:55:32,861
Please escort Mr. Turing
from the premises.

1015
00:55:32,894 --> 00:55:35,931
ALEXANDER: No.

1016
00:55:35,964 --> 00:55:38,601
DENNISTON: I beg your pardon?

1017
00:55:42,137 --> 00:55:46,074
If you fire Alan...

1018
00:55:46,107 --> 00:55:48,577
well, then you'll
have to fire me, too.

1019
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:51,213
What on earth are you saying?

1020
00:55:51,246 --> 00:55:52,648
ALEXANDER: Trust me when
I tell you there is no one

1021
00:55:52,681 --> 00:55:56,518
who would rather say this
less than I do, but...

1022
00:55:57,052 --> 00:55:58,052
he's right.

1023
00:55:58,053 --> 00:56:00,155
Alan is right.

1024
00:56:00,188 --> 00:56:02,391
His machine can work,
and it's probably

1025
00:56:02,424 --> 00:56:04,726
the best chance that we've got.

1026
00:56:04,759 --> 00:56:06,995
God, it's beyond belief.

1027
00:56:07,028 --> 00:56:09,197
CAIRNCROSS: If you fire them...

1028
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:11,867
you'll have to fire me, too.

1029
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,635
PETER: And me.

1030
00:56:13,668 --> 00:56:17,105
ALEXANDER: We're the best
cryptographic minds in Britain.

1031
00:56:17,138 --> 00:56:19,141
Are you going to fire us all?

1032
00:56:19,174 --> 00:56:21,610
Commander, at least
give us some more time.

1033
00:56:21,643 --> 00:56:24,379
Six months, and if the
machine doesn't produce

1034
00:56:24,412 --> 00:56:26,281
any results that we need,
then we'll go back

1035
00:56:26,314 --> 00:56:29,084
to doing things the old way...
how about that?

1036
00:56:35,523 --> 00:56:37,726
One month.

1037
00:56:37,759 --> 00:56:41,430
And then, so help me
God, you're all gone.

1038
00:56:41,463 --> 00:56:43,365
Oh, leave him.

1039
00:56:45,633 --> 00:56:47,469

1040
00:56:48,536 --> 00:56:50,505

1041
00:56:50,538 --> 00:56:52,774
Thank you.

1042
00:56:52,807 --> 00:56:54,410
You're welcome.

1043
00:56:55,443 --> 00:56:57,713
Oh, and, Alan, your machine...

1044
00:57:00,815 --> 00:57:02,718
it better bloody work.

1045
00:57:02,751 --> 00:57:05,587

1046
00:57:06,521 --> 00:57:09,425

1047
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:12,528
TURING: Hugh.

1048
00:57:13,094 --> 00:57:15,030
I swear...

1049
00:57:15,563 --> 00:57:18,700
I'm not a spy.

1050
00:57:18,733 --> 00:57:21,770
Oh, for God's sake, of course
you're not a bloody spy.

1051
00:57:21,803 --> 00:57:22,971
What?

1052
00:57:23,004 --> 00:57:24,673
Denniston gave me
the Beale cipher,

1053
00:57:24,706 --> 00:57:25,941
and guess what?

1054
00:57:25,974 --> 00:57:27,175
I cracked it.

1055
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:29,478
"Ask, and it shall
be given to you;

1056
00:57:29,511 --> 00:57:32,180
Seek and ye shall find."
Matthew 7:7.

1057
00:57:32,213 --> 00:57:34,483
That was the key.

1058
00:57:34,516 --> 00:57:38,053
Far too simple
for the likes of you.

1059
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:42,091
Pity Denniston disagrees.

1060
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:47,129

1061
00:57:50,865 --> 00:57:53,569
- Come in.

1062
00:57:55,403 --> 00:57:58,140
Sir, I think I've got Turing.

1063
00:57:58,173 --> 00:57:59,541
I tailed him

1064
00:57:59,574 --> 00:58:02,144
to a pub last night,
where he met a bloke.

1065
00:58:02,177 --> 00:58:03,258
They exchanged an envelope.

1066
00:58:03,278 --> 00:58:05,113
So I follow this other fella,

1067
00:58:05,146 --> 00:58:07,182
pick him up,
give him a good shake.

1068
00:58:08,316 --> 00:58:10,919
He's a poofter. He confessed.

1069
00:58:10,952 --> 00:58:12,287
What?

1070
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,589
The man admitted it.
Arnold Murray.

1071
00:58:14,622 --> 00:58:17,492
Hangs around that pub;
Men pay him for a go.

1072
00:58:17,525 --> 00:58:19,694
Turing's one of
the men that paid.

1073
00:58:19,727 --> 00:58:20,896
Only Mr. Murray here

1074
00:58:20,929 --> 00:58:22,564
then has the bright idea

1075
00:58:22,597 --> 00:58:25,834
of robbing Turing's house
after, with a friend.

1076
00:58:25,867 --> 00:58:27,335
That's what Turing's hiding.

1077
00:58:27,368 --> 00:58:29,738
Well, he's a poof, not a spy.

1078
00:58:29,771 --> 00:58:31,106
- No.
- What's the matter?

1079
00:58:31,139 --> 00:58:32,908
We can charge a
university professor

1080
00:58:32,941 --> 00:58:34,342
- with indecency.
- No, this is...

1081
00:58:34,375 --> 00:58:35,710
it's bloody rubbish.

1082
00:58:35,743 --> 00:58:37,112
Turing's up
to something important...

1083
00:58:37,145 --> 00:58:38,246
He's committed a crime

1084
00:58:38,279 --> 00:58:39,381
and he's broken the law.

1085
00:58:39,414 --> 00:58:41,316
And with a bloke. Jesus Christ,

1086
00:58:41,349 --> 00:58:43,118
- it's bloody disgusting.
- This isn't

1087
00:58:43,151 --> 00:58:44,920
the investigation
I was conducting.

1088
00:58:44,953 --> 00:58:47,355
Bring him in.

1089
00:58:47,388 --> 00:58:48,457
Wait.

1090
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:49,224

1091
00:58:49,257 --> 00:58:50,358
L-Let me interrogate him.

1092
00:58:50,391 --> 00:58:52,561
Please. Give me
half an hour alone,

1093
00:58:52,594 --> 00:58:54,529
and then I swear,
I'll spend the next month

1094
00:58:54,562 --> 00:58:57,065
running errands on as many
rubbish cases as you like.

1095
00:58:57,098 --> 00:59:00,101
Fine. Now,
will someone get me a warrant

1096
00:59:00,134 --> 00:59:02,504
for the arrest of Alan Turing.

1097
00:59:09,043 --> 00:59:12,448

1098
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,155
Alan?

1099
00:59:20,188 --> 00:59:23,258
Christopher's simply
not moving fast enough.

1100
00:59:23,291 --> 00:59:26,294
We should talk. -And even
with the diagonal board,

1101
00:59:26,327 --> 00:59:27,796
he's still not eliminating
settings as quickly

1102
00:59:27,829 --> 00:59:29,965
- as we need him to in order...
- I'm leaving.

1103
00:59:29,998 --> 00:59:31,833
But you've just walked in.

1104
00:59:31,866 --> 00:59:33,068
No.

1105
00:59:33,101 --> 00:59:35,003
No. Bletchley.

1106
00:59:35,036 --> 00:59:36,238
What?

1107
00:59:36,271 --> 00:59:37,472
It's my parents.

1108
00:59:37,505 --> 00:59:40,108
I'm 25, I'm unmarried,
I'm living alone,

1109
00:59:40,141 --> 00:59:41,409
and they want me home.

1110
00:59:41,442 --> 00:59:43,812
That's ridiculous.

1111
00:59:43,845 --> 00:59:45,347
That's my parents.

1112
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:49,084
You... you can't leave...
I-I won't let you.

1113
00:59:49,117 --> 00:59:51,920
"I'll miss you.
" That's what a normal person

1114
00:59:51,953 --> 00:59:55,023
- might say in this situation.
- I-I don't care what is normal.

1115
00:59:55,056 --> 00:59:59,694
What am I supposed to do, Alan?

1116
00:59:59,727 --> 01:00:01,229
I-I will not...

1117
01:00:01,262 --> 01:00:03,665
give up my parents.

1118
01:00:03,698 --> 01:00:06,334
You... you have
an opportunity here

1119
01:00:06,367 --> 01:00:08,303
to make some actual use
of your life.

1120
01:00:08,336 --> 01:00:11,139
And end up like you?
No, thanks.

1121
01:00:11,172 --> 01:00:13,441
- I'm sorry you're lonely.

1122
01:00:13,474 --> 01:00:16,678
But Enigma will not save you.

1123
01:00:16,711 --> 01:00:19,481
Can you decipher that,
you fragile narcissist?

1124
01:00:19,514 --> 01:00:20,649
Or would you like me
to go and fetch

1125
01:00:20,682 --> 01:00:22,651
your precious Christopher
to help?

1126
01:00:25,653 --> 01:00:28,623

1127
01:00:28,656 --> 01:00:29,891
I'm sorry.

1128
01:00:29,924 --> 01:00:32,227
Mm...

1129
01:00:33,027 --> 01:00:35,364

1130
01:00:36,564 --> 01:00:39,935
I want you...
I want you to stay because I-I like you.

1131
01:00:39,968 --> 01:00:43,271
I like... talking to you.

1132
01:00:43,304 --> 01:00:45,974
I like talking to you,
too, Alan.

1133
01:00:51,112 --> 01:00:53,515
And what if you weren't alone?

1134
01:00:53,548 --> 01:00:55,784
What if you had a husband?

1135
01:00:55,817 --> 01:00:57,252

1136
01:00:57,285 --> 01:00:59,521
Do you have one in mind?

1137
01:00:59,554 --> 01:01:00,989
I do.

1138
01:01:01,022 --> 01:01:02,524
Hugh?

1139
01:01:02,557 --> 01:01:04,626
Hugh's terribly attractive,
I'll give you that,

1140
01:01:04,659 --> 01:01:06,861
but I don't really think
he's the marrying kind.

1141
01:01:06,894 --> 01:01:10,298
No, I-I wasn't thinking of Hugh.

1142
01:01:10,331 --> 01:01:12,067
Or Peter.

1143
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,469
Peter's so quiet.

1144
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:20,542
Oh, my God.

1145
01:01:20,575 --> 01:01:22,143
But this makes sense.

1146
01:01:22,176 --> 01:01:23,612
Did you just propose to me?

1147
01:01:23,645 --> 01:01:26,481
Well, it is
the logical thing to do.

1148
01:01:26,514 --> 01:01:27,782
This is ridiculous.

1149
01:01:27,815 --> 01:01:28,850
This is your parents.

1150
01:01:28,883 --> 01:01:32,788
I-I can't... believe
that this is happening.

1151
01:01:34,355 --> 01:01:37,926
Mm. Joan...

1152
01:01:37,959 --> 01:01:40,528
Is your middle name
Caroline or Catherine?

1153
01:01:40,561 --> 01:01:43,932
- Elizabeth.
- Um, Joan Elizabeth...

1154
01:01:43,965 --> 01:01:45,934
Clarke, um...

1155
01:01:47,969 --> 01:01:51,039
will you marry me?

1156
01:01:52,073 --> 01:01:55,310

1157
01:01:59,247 --> 01:02:01,216
WOMAN: It's beautiful.

1158
01:02:01,249 --> 01:02:05,420
Well, I know
it isn't ordinary, but...

1159
01:02:05,453 --> 01:02:08,423
whoever loved ordinary?

1160
01:02:08,456 --> 01:02:10,625
- ALEXANDER: She had it in both hands...

1161
01:02:10,658 --> 01:02:13,595
and she looked up at me
with her doe eyes and said,

1162
01:02:13,628 --> 01:02:15,730
"Am I supposed
to put that in my mouth?"

1163
01:02:15,763 --> 01:02:19,934
And I said, "Yes.
You know, the French way."

1164
01:02:19,967 --> 01:02:21,636
So she pops it in,

1165
01:02:21,669 --> 01:02:23,471
clamps her lips around it,

1166
01:02:23,504 --> 01:02:26,775
and starts humming
the bloody Marseillaise.

1167
01:02:26,808 --> 01:02:28,510

1168
01:02:30,378 --> 01:02:31,613
Come have a dance.

1169
01:02:31,646 --> 01:02:33,081
ALEXANDER: No, no,
no, you can dance

1170
01:02:33,114 --> 01:02:34,082
with your fiance
anytime you like.

1171
01:02:34,115 --> 01:02:35,383
Right now, this moment...

1172
01:02:35,416 --> 01:02:37,318
- My turn.

1173
01:02:37,351 --> 01:02:40,021

1174
01:02:40,054 --> 01:02:41,657

1175
01:02:52,967 --> 01:02:55,136

1176
01:02:55,169 --> 01:02:58,874

1177
01:03:05,146 --> 01:03:06,948
What's the matter?

1178
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,456
Wh-What if...

1179
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:22,263
Wh-What if I don't
fancy being...

1180
01:03:22,296 --> 01:03:25,834
with Joan I-in that way?

1181
01:03:27,668 --> 01:03:30,372
Because you're a homosexual?

1182
01:03:34,041 --> 01:03:36,277
I suspected.

1183
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:37,846
Well, should-should I tell her

1184
01:03:37,879 --> 01:03:41,382
that I've had...
affairs with men?

1185
01:03:41,415 --> 01:03:43,351
You know, in my...

1186
01:03:43,384 --> 01:03:46,354
admittedly limited experience,

1187
01:03:46,387 --> 01:03:48,723
women... tend to be a bit touchy

1188
01:03:48,756 --> 01:03:51,860
about accidentally
marrying homosexuals.

1189
01:03:51,893 --> 01:03:54,362
Perhaps not spreading
this information about might be

1190
01:03:54,395 --> 01:03:55,663
in your best interest.

1191
01:03:55,696 --> 01:03:58,333

1192
01:03:58,366 --> 01:04:01,703
TURING: I care for her, I truly do.
I...

1193
01:04:05,006 --> 01:04:06,608
I-I... I just don't know

1194
01:04:06,641 --> 01:04:10,145
if I can, um... pretend.

1195
01:04:10,178 --> 01:04:12,814
You can't tell anyone, Alan.

1196
01:04:12,847 --> 01:04:14,783
It's illegal.

1197
01:04:14,816 --> 01:04:17,952
And Denniston is looking
for any excuse he can

1198
01:04:17,985 --> 01:04:19,387
to put you away.

1199
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:20,655
I know.

1200
01:04:20,688 --> 01:04:22,457
This has to stay a secret.

1201
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:24,893
JOAN: Come on, it's your turn.

1202
01:04:24,926 --> 01:04:26,795
Ah. Okay.

1203
01:04:26,828 --> 01:04:29,965

1204
01:04:44,512 --> 01:04:46,981

1205
01:04:47,014 --> 01:04:49,518

1206
01:04:55,189 --> 01:04:57,993

1207
01:05:04,932 --> 01:05:07,169

1208
01:05:13,241 --> 01:05:15,944

1209
01:05:21,782 --> 01:05:24,519

1210
01:05:39,834 --> 01:05:42,137

1211
01:05:48,509 --> 01:05:50,078
Cup of tea?

1212
01:05:50,111 --> 01:05:53,148
No, thank you.

1213
01:05:58,185 --> 01:06:00,222

1214
01:06:04,992 --> 01:06:07,896
Mr. Turing, can I
tell you a secret?

1215
01:06:07,929 --> 01:06:09,697
I'm quite good with those.

1216
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:12,067
I'm here to help you.

1217
01:06:14,368 --> 01:06:16,204
Oh, clearly.

1218
01:06:16,237 --> 01:06:18,573

1219
01:06:22,843 --> 01:06:24,846
Can machines think?

1220
01:06:24,879 --> 01:06:28,182
Oh, so you've read some
of my published works?

1221
01:06:28,215 --> 01:06:30,218
What makes you say that?

1222
01:06:30,251 --> 01:06:32,987
Well, because I'm sitting
in a police station,

1223
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:36,224
accused of entreating
a young man to touch my penis

1224
01:06:36,257 --> 01:06:40,195
and you just asked me
if machines can think.

1225
01:06:41,529 --> 01:06:44,332
Well, can they?

1226
01:06:44,365 --> 01:06:49,203
Could machines ever think
as human beings do?

1227
01:06:49,236 --> 01:06:51,172
Most people say not.

1228
01:06:51,205 --> 01:06:53,842
You're not most people.

1229
01:06:55,376 --> 01:06:59,147
Well, the problem is you're...
asking a stupid question.

1230
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:01,115
I am?

1231
01:07:01,148 --> 01:07:02,884
Of course machines...

1232
01:07:02,917 --> 01:07:06,254
can't think as people do.

1233
01:07:06,287 --> 01:07:10,625
A machine is different...
from a person.

1234
01:07:11,625 --> 01:07:14,062
Hence, they think differently.

1235
01:07:17,164 --> 01:07:20,601
The interesting question is,
just because something, uh,

1236
01:07:20,634 --> 01:07:22,036
thinks differently from you,

1237
01:07:22,069 --> 01:07:25,240
does that mean
it's not thinking?

1238
01:07:26,674 --> 01:07:29,744
Well, we allow for humans
to have such divergences

1239
01:07:29,777 --> 01:07:31,680
from one another.

1240
01:07:34,248 --> 01:07:36,851
You like strawberries,
I hate ice-skating,

1241
01:07:36,884 --> 01:07:39,687
you... cry at sad films,

1242
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:43,558
I... am allergic to pollen.

1243
01:07:43,591 --> 01:07:46,394
What is the point
of-of different tastes,

1244
01:07:46,427 --> 01:07:48,663
different... preferences

1245
01:07:48,696 --> 01:07:51,733
if not to say that
our brains work differently,

1246
01:07:51,766 --> 01:07:55,636
that we think differently?

1247
01:07:55,669 --> 01:07:57,338
And if we can say that
about one another,

1248
01:07:57,371 --> 01:08:01,409
then why can't we say
the same thing for brains...

1249
01:08:01,442 --> 01:08:04,545
built of copper and wire, steel?

1250
01:08:04,578 --> 01:08:08,750
And that's... this
big paper you wrote?

1251
01:08:08,783 --> 01:08:10,084
What's it called?

1252
01:08:10,117 --> 01:08:13,454
"The Imitation Game."

1253
01:08:13,487 --> 01:08:15,556
Right, that's... that's
what it's about?

1254
01:08:15,589 --> 01:08:19,394

1255
01:08:21,395 --> 01:08:22,630
Would you like to play?

1256
01:08:22,663 --> 01:08:24,532
Play?

1257
01:08:24,565 --> 01:08:25,833
It's a game.

1258
01:08:25,866 --> 01:08:28,069
A test of sorts.

1259
01:08:28,102 --> 01:08:31,439
For determining
whether something is a...

1260
01:08:31,472 --> 01:08:33,641
a machine or a human being.

1261
01:08:33,674 --> 01:08:35,610
How do I play?

1262
01:08:35,643 --> 01:08:37,745
Well, there's a judge
and a subject, and...

1263
01:08:37,778 --> 01:08:40,148
the judge asks questions,

1264
01:08:40,181 --> 01:08:42,517
and, depending
on the subject's answers,

1265
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:44,952
determines who
he is talking with...

1266
01:08:44,985 --> 01:08:49,757
what he is talking with,
and, um...

1267
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:52,994
All you have to do
is ask me a question.

1268
01:08:57,998 --> 01:08:59,901
What did you do during the war?

1269
01:08:59,934 --> 01:09:02,404
I worked in a radio factory.

1270
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:06,607
What did you really do
during the war?

1271
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,810

1272
01:09:10,778 --> 01:09:13,181
Are you paying attention?

1273
01:09:13,981 --> 01:09:17,218

1274
01:09:28,229 --> 01:09:31,699

1275
01:09:31,732 --> 01:09:34,069
Damn it!

1276
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:40,808

1277
01:09:40,841 --> 01:09:44,112
CAIRNCROSS:
We're soon out of time. A month.

1278
01:09:44,145 --> 01:09:46,147
PETER: So that's it, then, is it?

1279
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:48,883
Oh, the trouble is, it doesn't
matter how much we improve it.

1280
01:09:48,916 --> 01:09:50,451
The machine's never
gonna be able to process

1281
01:09:50,484 --> 01:09:53,488
159 million million million
possibilities in time.

1282
01:09:53,521 --> 01:09:55,756
It's just bloody hopeless.

1283
01:09:55,789 --> 01:09:58,159
It's searching. It's just...

1284
01:09:58,192 --> 01:10:01,863
It... doesn't know
what it's searching for.

1285
01:10:01,896 --> 01:10:03,865
If we knew what the messages
were going to say...

1286
01:10:03,898 --> 01:10:05,166
If we knew what the messages
were going to say,

1287
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:06,968
we wouldn't have
to decrypt them at all.

1288
01:10:07,001 --> 01:10:09,403

1289
01:10:09,436 --> 01:10:12,240

1290
01:10:12,273 --> 01:10:14,041
Who's Alan's friend?

1291
01:10:14,074 --> 01:10:17,245
Hugh. He's a bit
of a cad, actually.

1292
01:10:17,278 --> 01:10:19,113
So my type, then?

1293
01:10:19,146 --> 01:10:21,449
- Well, I'll introduce you.
- No.

1294
01:10:21,482 --> 01:10:23,551
He'll come over.

1295
01:10:23,584 --> 01:10:25,486
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1296
01:10:25,519 --> 01:10:27,088
I smiled at him 15 minutes ago

1297
01:10:27,121 --> 01:10:28,523
and haven't looked back since.

1298
01:10:28,556 --> 01:10:30,925

1299
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:32,360
Who's that with Joan?

1300
01:10:32,393 --> 01:10:33,728
Hmm?

1301
01:10:33,761 --> 01:10:36,297
TURING: Uh, Helen. Works with her.

1302
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:37,832
She's really pretty.

1303
01:10:37,865 --> 01:10:39,300
She wants me to come over.

1304
01:10:39,333 --> 01:10:41,969
What? H-How on earth
can you know that?

1305
01:10:42,002 --> 01:10:43,971
She smiled at me a while back

1306
01:10:44,004 --> 01:10:46,207
and she hasn't
looked again since.

1307
01:10:51,345 --> 01:10:52,346
And got him.

1308
01:10:52,379 --> 01:10:55,016
Now, why is this,
that when I was single

1309
01:10:55,049 --> 01:10:57,285
I found it very boring,
but now that I'm engaged,

1310
01:10:57,318 --> 01:10:59,287
I just find it dreadfully fun.

1311
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,422

1312
01:11:01,455 --> 01:11:03,391
Bingo. She's in.

1313
01:11:03,424 --> 01:11:05,326
Alan, introduce us.

1314
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:07,495
What?
Wh-Why me?

1315
01:11:09,129 --> 01:11:11,032
Because there's nothing
like a friend's engagement

1316
01:11:11,065 --> 01:11:12,967
to make a woman want to do
something she'll later regret

1317
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,369
with the fiance's
better looking chum.

1318
01:11:15,402 --> 01:11:17,005
Let's go.

1319
01:11:21,408 --> 01:11:24,679
Half a crown says Alan
bollixes this up entirely.

1320
01:11:24,712 --> 01:11:26,147
- No bet.

1321
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:28,816
- Alan Turing has a theory.
- JOAN: He has many.

1322
01:11:28,849 --> 01:11:30,551
He believes that the regulations

1323
01:11:30,584 --> 01:11:33,988
against men and women working
side by side are sound

1324
01:11:34,021 --> 01:11:36,057
because such proximity will
necessarily lead to romance.

1325
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:38,859
What? No, I don't.
I... However...

1326
01:11:38,892 --> 01:11:39,961
I disagree.

1327
01:11:39,994 --> 01:11:41,529
- You do?
- Yeah.

1328
01:11:41,962 --> 01:11:44,398
I think that if I were working
beside a woman all day long,

1329
01:11:44,431 --> 01:11:47,267
I could appreciate her
abilities and intellect

1330
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:49,870
without taking her to bed.

1331
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:51,839
I'm sorry, have we met?

1332
01:11:51,872 --> 01:11:54,675
I don't recall.
But let's assume we haven't.

1333
01:11:54,708 --> 01:11:56,477
Helen Stewart. Hugh Alexander.

1334
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:57,745
So who do you agree with,

1335
01:11:57,778 --> 01:11:59,947
- Alan or myself?
- Well, Alan, of course.

1336
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:03,050
I-I'm very flattered, really,
but I-I don't think...

1337
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:06,286
- ALEXANDER: Rubbish.
-HELEN: Well, I work beside a man

1338
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:07,855
every day, and I can't help

1339
01:12:07,888 --> 01:12:09,568
but have developed
a bit of a crush on him.

1340
01:12:09,589 --> 01:12:11,558
Well, who is this man?
So I can kick his arse.

1341
01:12:11,591 --> 01:12:13,761
Well, there's no need
to worry... it's been chaste.

1342
01:12:13,794 --> 01:12:16,463
We've never even met.
He's a German.

1343
01:12:16,496 --> 01:12:19,700
- Now I really want to kill him.

1344
01:12:19,733 --> 01:12:23,303
How-how do you mean
you work alongside a German?

1345
01:12:23,336 --> 01:12:25,172
Well, each of us
intercepts messages

1346
01:12:25,205 --> 01:12:26,907
from a specific
German radio tower.

1347
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:28,442
So we have a counterpart
on the other side

1348
01:12:28,475 --> 01:12:30,077
who's tip-tapping out
the messages.

1349
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:31,812
Everyone types
a touch differently,

1350
01:12:31,845 --> 01:12:34,048
so you get to know the rhythm
of your counterpart.

1351
01:12:34,081 --> 01:12:35,749
It's strangely intimate.

1352
01:12:35,782 --> 01:12:38,085
I feel as if I know him so well.

1353
01:12:38,118 --> 01:12:39,486
It's a pity he has a girlfriend,

1354
01:12:39,519 --> 01:12:41,822
but that's why I disagree
with you, Mr. Alexander.

1355
01:12:41,855 --> 01:12:44,158
Because I'm in love
with a coworker of sorts,

1356
01:12:44,191 --> 01:12:45,592
and we've never even met.

1357
01:12:45,625 --> 01:12:47,428
Well, allow me to buy
you another pint,

1358
01:12:47,461 --> 01:12:49,329
and I'll tell you
why you're wrong.

1359
01:12:49,362 --> 01:12:50,964
Let's.

1360
01:12:50,997 --> 01:12:52,599
Excellent.

1361
01:12:52,632 --> 01:12:54,502

1362
01:12:54,968 --> 01:12:56,704
Thanks.

1363
01:12:56,737 --> 01:13:00,908
ALEXANDER: Um, pints.
Have you got any sloe gin?

1364
01:13:03,677 --> 01:13:06,146
In case you were wondering,
that's what flirting looks like.

1365
01:13:06,179 --> 01:13:07,581
TURING LOUDLY: Helen...

1366
01:13:07,614 --> 01:13:08,916
Really, no cigarettes?

1367
01:13:08,949 --> 01:13:11,218
Alan... Yes, Alan?

1368
01:13:11,251 --> 01:13:12,653
Wh-Why do you think

1369
01:13:12,686 --> 01:13:15,122
your German counterpart has a girlfriend?
It's just

1370
01:13:15,155 --> 01:13:18,626
- a stupid joke; Don't worry.
- No, no, no, no. Tell me.

1371
01:13:19,459 --> 01:13:20,594
Well, each of his messages

1372
01:13:20,627 --> 01:13:22,229
begins with the same
five letters:

1373
01:13:22,262 --> 01:13:23,997
C-I-L-L-Y.

1374
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:25,866
So I suspect that Cilly
must be the name

1375
01:13:25,899 --> 01:13:27,601
- of his amore.
- But that's impossible.

1376
01:13:27,634 --> 01:13:30,037
The Germans are instructed
to use five random letters

1377
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:31,205
at the start of every message.

1378
01:13:31,238 --> 01:13:32,639
HELEN: Well, this bloke doesn't.

1379
01:13:32,672 --> 01:13:36,009
Love will make a man do
strange things, I suppose.

1380
01:13:36,042 --> 01:13:39,813
In this case, love just lost
Germany the whole bloody war.

1381
01:13:39,846 --> 01:13:41,148
Oh!

1382
01:13:41,181 --> 01:13:42,583
Go, Peter.

1383
01:13:44,050 --> 01:13:45,653
Sorry.

1384
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:50,724
JOAN: Alan!
Alan!

1385
01:13:50,757 --> 01:13:54,394
GUARDS: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey! -Alan!

1386
01:13:54,427 --> 01:13:56,964
- I just want...

1387
01:13:56,997 --> 01:13:59,133

1388
01:13:59,166 --> 01:14:01,034
Hugh Alexander. John Cairncross.

1389
01:14:01,067 --> 01:14:02,402
Peter bloody Hilton.

1390
01:14:02,435 --> 01:14:06,474
Alan?
What-wha...?

1391
01:14:08,108 --> 01:14:09,777
PANTING: What...

1392
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:12,513
what if... what if Christopher

1393
01:14:12,546 --> 01:14:15,883
doesn't have to search
through all of the settings?

1394
01:14:15,916 --> 01:14:17,818
What if he only has
to search through

1395
01:14:17,851 --> 01:14:20,721
ones that produce words
we already know will be

1396
01:14:20,754 --> 01:14:23,457
in the message? -Repeated
words; Predictable words.

1397
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:24,358
Exactly.

1398
01:14:24,391 --> 01:14:26,927

1399
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,395
JOAN: Look, look, like this one.

1400
01:14:28,428 --> 01:14:30,397
"0600 hours. Weather
today is clear.

1401
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:32,432
Rain in the evening.
Heil Hitler."

1402
01:14:32,465 --> 01:14:34,268

1403
01:14:34,301 --> 01:14:36,236
Well, that's it.

1404
01:14:36,269 --> 01:14:37,671
Exactly.

1405
01:14:37,704 --> 01:14:40,707
They send a weather report
every day at 6:00 a.m.

1406
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:44,044
So that's-that's three
words we know will be

1407
01:14:44,077 --> 01:14:46,947
in every 6:00 a.m. message...
"weather," obviously,

1408
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:49,316
- a-and...
- Heil bloody Hitler.

1409
01:14:49,349 --> 01:14:51,084
Heil bloody Hitler.

1410
01:14:51,117 --> 01:14:54,021
Here's the 6:00 message from this morning.

1411
01:14:55,255 --> 01:14:57,024

1412
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:01,795
TURING: Hugh, the, uh,

1413
01:15:01,828 --> 01:15:03,697
the right-hand letter wheel,
set them to...

1414
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:05,250
I know, I know.
"Weather" and "Hitler."

1415
01:15:05,265 --> 01:15:07,935
Peter, John, run voltages
through those letters,

1416
01:15:07,968 --> 01:15:10,304
- through the back scramblers.
- PETER: So we'll use the loops?

1417
01:15:10,337 --> 01:15:13,106
- TURING: Yes. Joan, what was
- the last 6: 00 a.m. message?

1418
01:15:13,139 --> 01:15:15,742
- L...

1419
01:15:15,775 --> 01:15:20,214
- H... - TURING: H...
- W... TURING: W...

1420
01:15:20,247 --> 01:15:23,818
- JOAN: A... - A... - Q.
- Q.

1421
01:15:25,352 --> 01:15:26,954
Done.

1422
01:15:27,888 --> 01:15:30,290

1423
01:15:30,323 --> 01:15:32,927

1424
01:15:44,537 --> 01:15:46,240
QUIETLY: Come on.

1425
01:15:46,273 --> 01:15:48,843
Come on. Come on, Christopher.

1426
01:15:53,046 --> 01:15:55,249

1427
01:15:59,352 --> 01:16:01,555

1428
01:16:03,924 --> 01:16:05,693
Oh, my God.

1429
01:16:07,661 --> 01:16:10,030

1430
01:16:12,365 --> 01:16:14,067
Wh-What happened?

1431
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:15,335

1432
01:16:15,368 --> 01:16:17,604
- Did it work?
- Alan?

1433
01:16:17,637 --> 01:16:19,907
ALEXANDER: Alan!
Alan!

1434
01:16:22,208 --> 01:16:24,278
I need a new message.

1435
01:16:24,311 --> 01:16:26,680
The latest intercept.

1436
01:16:29,683 --> 01:16:32,286
SOFTLY: Thank you.

1437
01:16:35,488 --> 01:16:38,659
- O... T...
- JOAN: Ready? - Yes.

1438
01:16:38,692 --> 01:16:40,693
- M... - M... - Y...
- Y...

1439
01:16:40,694 --> 01:16:43,363

1445
01:16:55,775 --> 01:16:58,812
- TURING: I.

1446
01:17:01,948 --> 01:17:03,850
"KMS Jaguar is auf punkt...

1447
01:17:03,883 --> 01:17:06,687
"is directed to 53 degrees
24 minutes north

1448
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:11,224
and auf punkt one...
degree west."

1449
01:17:11,257 --> 01:17:14,261
TURING&ALEXANDER QUIETLY: Heil Hitler.

1450
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:20,367
Turns out that's the only German
you need to know

1451
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,003
to, uh, break Enigma.

1452
01:17:25,038 --> 01:17:27,574

1453
01:17:27,607 --> 01:17:30,043

1454
01:17:30,076 --> 01:17:32,246
Yes!

1455
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:36,416

1456
01:17:36,449 --> 01:17:39,286

1457
01:17:44,491 --> 01:17:47,327

1458
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,596

1459
01:17:49,629 --> 01:17:52,132

1460
01:18:07,714 --> 01:18:10,084

1461
01:18:12,786 --> 01:18:14,621

1462
01:18:14,654 --> 01:18:15,922
Oh!

1463
01:18:15,955 --> 01:18:17,557

1464
01:18:17,590 --> 01:18:19,960

1465
01:18:24,397 --> 01:18:26,099
- JOAN: M...
- TURING: M...

1466
01:18:26,132 --> 01:18:26,833

1467
01:18:26,866 --> 01:18:29,336
- A... - A... - Y...
- Y...

1468
01:18:29,369 --> 01:18:32,105
- I... - I... - T...

1469
01:18:32,138 --> 01:18:35,308
- R... - R... - O...

1470
01:18:35,341 --> 01:18:38,745
- T... A... - A... - H...
- H...

1471
01:18:38,778 --> 01:18:45,752
- Q... - Q... - TURING: U...
- U...

1472
01:18:45,785 --> 01:18:49,790
- R.
- R.

1473
01:18:51,691 --> 01:18:54,027
ALEXANDER: My God, you did it.

1474
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:58,098
You just defeated Nazism
with a crossword puzzle.

1475
01:18:58,131 --> 01:18:59,900
There are five people
in the world who know

1476
01:18:59,933 --> 01:19:01,435
the position of every
ship in the Atlantic.

1477
01:19:01,468 --> 01:19:02,803
They're all

1478
01:19:02,836 --> 01:19:04,671
- in this room.
- Oh, good God.

1479
01:19:04,704 --> 01:19:06,224
Oh, I don't think
even He has the power

1480
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,674
- that we do right now.
- JOAN: No.

1481
01:19:07,707 --> 01:19:09,176
There's going to be an attack

1482
01:19:09,209 --> 01:19:11,078
on a British passenger convoy.

1483
01:19:11,111 --> 01:19:12,179
Right there.

1484
01:19:12,212 --> 01:19:14,614
God, you're right.
All those U-boats are only

1485
01:19:14,647 --> 01:19:16,183
- 20, 30 minutes away.
- JOAN: Civilians.

1486
01:19:16,216 --> 01:19:18,018
Hundreds of them.
We can save their lives.

1487
01:19:18,051 --> 01:19:19,719
ALEXANDER: I'll phone
Denniston's office so that

1488
01:19:19,752 --> 01:19:20,987
- he can alert the Admiralty.
- Do you think

1489
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:22,155
there's enough time
to save them?

1490
01:19:22,188 --> 01:19:23,557
There should be,
if we can get...

1491
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:24,558
Commander Denniston's office,

1492
01:19:24,591 --> 01:19:25,959
please. It's urgent.

1493
01:19:25,992 --> 01:19:26,760
No.

1494
01:19:26,793 --> 01:19:28,428
What the hell are you doing?

1495
01:19:28,461 --> 01:19:30,163
You-you can't call Denniston.

1496
01:19:30,196 --> 01:19:32,265
You-you can't tell him
about the attack.

1497
01:19:32,298 --> 01:19:34,134
- What are you talking about?
- CAIRNCROSS: We can have

1498
01:19:34,167 --> 01:19:35,836
air support over that
convoy in ten minutes.

1499
01:19:35,869 --> 01:19:36,970
Let the U-boats...

1500
01:19:37,003 --> 01:19:38,171
- sink the convoy.
- Look, it's been

1501
01:19:38,204 --> 01:19:39,539
a big day... maybe you're...

1502
01:19:39,572 --> 01:19:43,043
- We don't have time...
- No!

1503
01:19:43,076 --> 01:19:44,845
JOAN: Oh! Hugh! Hugh!
That's enough!

1504
01:19:44,878 --> 01:19:46,480
- That's enough!
- CAIRNCROSS: Stop, Hugh!

1505
01:19:46,513 --> 01:19:47,814
John, the attack is in minutes.

1506
01:19:47,847 --> 01:19:49,349

1507
01:19:49,382 --> 01:19:51,251
Yes, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1508
01:19:51,284 --> 01:19:53,720
I'm fine.

1509
01:19:53,753 --> 01:19:57,724
You know why people
like violence, Hugh?

1510
01:19:57,757 --> 01:20:00,393
It's because it feels good.

1511
01:20:00,426 --> 01:20:04,164
TURING: Sometimes we can't do
what feels good.

1512
01:20:04,197 --> 01:20:06,233
We have to do what is logical.

1513
01:20:06,266 --> 01:20:07,934
What's logical?

1514
01:20:07,967 --> 01:20:09,336
Hardest time to lie to somebody

1515
01:20:09,369 --> 01:20:11,605
is when they're expecting
to be lied to.

1516
01:20:11,638 --> 01:20:13,240
Oh, God.

1517
01:20:13,273 --> 01:20:14,641
What?

1518
01:20:14,674 --> 01:20:15,914
If someone's waiting for a lie,

1519
01:20:15,942 --> 01:20:17,711
you can't just,
uh, give them one.

1520
01:20:17,744 --> 01:20:19,412

1521
01:20:19,445 --> 01:20:21,148
Damn it, Alan's right.

1522
01:20:21,181 --> 01:20:22,883
What?

1523
01:20:22,916 --> 01:20:25,652
TURING: What would
the Germans think if we destroy

1524
01:20:25,685 --> 01:20:27,487
their U-boats?

1525
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,256
Nothing. They'll be dead.

1526
01:20:29,289 --> 01:20:30,657
No.

1527
01:20:30,690 --> 01:20:32,626
No, you can't be right.

1528
01:20:32,659 --> 01:20:33,793
TURING: So our convoy

1529
01:20:33,826 --> 01:20:36,596
suddenly veers off course...

1530
01:20:36,629 --> 01:20:38,598
a squadron of our air bombers

1531
01:20:38,631 --> 01:20:42,602
miraculously descends on the
coordinates of the U-boats...

1532
01:20:42,635 --> 01:20:46,807
what will the Germans think?

1533
01:20:47,473 --> 01:20:49,643
The Germans will know

1534
01:20:49,676 --> 01:20:51,645
that we have broken Enigma.

1535
01:20:51,678 --> 01:20:55,982
JOAN: They'll stop all
radio communications by midday,

1536
01:20:56,015 --> 01:20:57,775
and they'll have changed
the design of Enigma

1537
01:20:57,784 --> 01:21:00,854
- by the weekend.
- ALEXANDER: Yes.

1538
01:21:00,887 --> 01:21:02,822
Two years' work.

1539
01:21:02,855 --> 01:21:05,358
Everything that we've done here

1540
01:21:05,391 --> 01:21:07,260
will all be for nothing.

1541
01:21:07,293 --> 01:21:09,796
CAIRNCROSS: There are 500
civilians in that convoy.

1542
01:21:09,829 --> 01:21:13,800
Women... children.

1543
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:16,002
We're about to let them die.

1544
01:21:16,035 --> 01:21:17,470
TURING: Our job I-is

1545
01:21:17,503 --> 01:21:20,273
not to save one
passenger convoy, it is to win

1546
01:21:20,306 --> 01:21:24,044
- the war.
- Our job was to crack Enigma.

1547
01:21:24,077 --> 01:21:26,079
We've done that.

1548
01:21:26,112 --> 01:21:28,549
Now for the hard part.

1549
01:21:29,549 --> 01:21:32,319
- Keeping it a secret.
- PETER: Carlisle.

1550
01:21:32,352 --> 01:21:34,888
What?

1551
01:21:34,921 --> 01:21:37,123
The convoy you're about to...
it's, uh...

1552
01:21:37,156 --> 01:21:40,561
The HMS Carlisle
is one of the ships.

1553
01:21:41,861 --> 01:21:44,464
We can't act
on every piece of intelligence.

1554
01:21:44,497 --> 01:21:46,433
So fine, we won't.

1555
01:21:46,466 --> 01:21:48,034
Just this one.

1556
01:21:48,067 --> 01:21:51,004
Peter, what's
the matter with you?

1557
01:21:51,037 --> 01:21:53,707
My-my brother's...

1558
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:56,343
well, he's on the Carlisle.

1559
01:21:57,777 --> 01:22:00,614
A gunnery ensign.

1560
01:22:02,615 --> 01:22:08,388
I'm... I'm so sorry.

1561
01:22:10,223 --> 01:22:13,093
Who the hell
do you think you are?

1562
01:22:13,126 --> 01:22:15,428
This... this is my brother.

1563
01:22:15,461 --> 01:22:17,564

1564
01:22:17,597 --> 01:22:19,317
He's my big brother,
all right, and you have

1565
01:22:19,332 --> 01:22:20,967
a few minutes
to call off his murder.

1566
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,003
We can't.

1567
01:22:23,036 --> 01:22:24,404

1568
01:22:25,204 --> 01:22:27,907
CAIRNCROSS: He's right.

1569
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:30,176
Alan.

1570
01:22:30,209 --> 01:22:33,513
Joan.

1571
01:22:33,546 --> 01:22:35,215
Hugh.

1572
01:22:35,248 --> 01:22:37,550
John.

1573
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:40,053
CRYING: Please, I...

1574
01:22:40,086 --> 01:22:41,821
The-the Germans, they
won't get suspicious

1575
01:22:41,854 --> 01:22:43,623
just because we stop one attack.

1576
01:22:43,656 --> 01:22:46,059
No one will know.

1577
01:22:46,092 --> 01:22:50,597
I'm asking you...
as your friend.

1578
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:52,366
Please.

1579
01:22:55,068 --> 01:22:57,037
I'm so sorry.

1580
01:22:57,070 --> 01:23:00,173
You're not God, Alan...
you don't get to decide

1581
01:23:00,206 --> 01:23:02,475
who lives and who dies.

1582
01:23:02,508 --> 01:23:05,112
Yes, we do.

1583
01:23:06,946 --> 01:23:08,815
Why?

1584
01:23:08,848 --> 01:23:12,185
Because no one else can.

1585
01:23:12,218 --> 01:23:15,989

1586
01:23:25,965 --> 01:23:28,535

1587
01:23:39,912 --> 01:23:41,781

1588
01:23:41,814 --> 01:23:44,217

1589
01:23:58,731 --> 01:24:00,667
Why are you telling me this?

1590
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:04,838
We need your help to keep
this a secret from...

1591
01:24:04,871 --> 01:24:08,575
Admiralty, Army, RAF.

1592
01:24:08,608 --> 01:24:12,145
Uh, no one can know
we broke Enigma.

1593
01:24:12,178 --> 01:24:14,147
Not even Denniston.

1594
01:24:14,180 --> 01:24:17,016
Who's in the process
of having you fired.

1595
01:24:17,049 --> 01:24:18,718
You can take care of that.

1596
01:24:18,751 --> 01:24:21,788
While we develop a system
to help you determine

1597
01:24:21,821 --> 01:24:23,323
how much intelligence

1598
01:24:23,356 --> 01:24:26,092
to act on...
which a-attacks to stop,

1599
01:24:26,125 --> 01:24:27,125
which to let through.

1600
01:24:27,126 --> 01:24:29,829
Statistical analysis.

1601
01:24:29,862 --> 01:24:31,398
The minimal number of actions

1602
01:24:31,431 --> 01:24:34,134
it would take for us
to win the war...

1603
01:24:34,167 --> 01:24:36,803
but the maximum number
we can take

1604
01:24:36,836 --> 01:24:39,239
before the Germans
get suspicious.

1605
01:24:39,272 --> 01:24:43,376
And you're going to trust
all this to statistics?

1606
01:24:43,409 --> 01:24:46,112
- To maths?
- Correct.

1607
01:24:46,145 --> 01:24:48,214
And then MI6 can come up
with the lies

1608
01:24:48,247 --> 01:24:49,682
that we tell everybody else.

1609
01:24:49,715 --> 01:24:52,552
You'll need a believable
alternative source for all

1610
01:24:52,585 --> 01:24:55,422
the pieces of information you use.
A false story

1611
01:24:55,455 --> 01:24:57,991
so that we can explain
how we got our information

1612
01:24:58,024 --> 01:24:59,659
that has nothing to do
with Enigma.

1613
01:24:59,692 --> 01:25:03,129
And then you can leak those
stories to the, uh, the Germans.

1614
01:25:03,162 --> 01:25:05,465
And then to our own military.

1615
01:25:10,269 --> 01:25:12,472
Maintain a conspiracy of lies

1616
01:25:12,505 --> 01:25:15,409
at the highest levels
of government.

1617
01:25:23,015 --> 01:25:26,219
Sounds right up my alley.

1618
01:25:29,021 --> 01:25:31,724
Alan, I so rarely
have cause to say this,

1619
01:25:31,757 --> 01:25:36,329
but you are exactly the man
I always hoped you would be.

1620
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:47,441

1621
01:25:49,242 --> 01:25:52,712
TURING VOICE-OVER:
They code-named it "Ultra."

1622
01:25:52,745 --> 01:25:55,715
It became the largest store

1626
01:26:05,825 --> 01:26:10,129

The Soviets and us,
we're on the same side.

1645
01:27:45,324 --> 01:27:48,361
What I'm doing
will help Britain.

1646
01:27:48,394 --> 01:27:51,230
I-I have to tell Denniston.

1647
01:27:51,263 --> 01:27:54,367
No, you don't.

1648
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,836
Because if you tell
him my secret...

1649
01:27:56,869 --> 01:27:59,406
I'll tell him yours.

1650
01:28:00,606 --> 01:28:04,277
Do you know what they
do to homosexuals?

1651
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:06,312
You'll never be able
to work again,

1652
01:28:06,345 --> 01:28:08,381
never be able to teach.

01:28:46,318 --> 01:28:48,721

1663
01:28:48,754 --> 01:28:53,159
It's a lot easier if you don't
know them in the first place.

1664
01:28:53,192 --> 01:28:57,464
Were they steaming my letters,
tapping my telephone?

1665
01:28:58,464 --> 01:29:01,367
Trailing my nervous walks?

1666
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:06,305
You know, I... I
never did find out.

1667
01:29:06,338 --> 01:29:08,641
Joan?

1668
01:29:08,674 --> 01:29:10,877

1669
01:29:11,844 --> 01:29:13,279
Joan?

1670
01:29:13,312 --> 01:29:15,482
What's...

1671
01:29:17,183 --> 01:29:20,486
Uh... where's Joan?

1672
01:29:20,519 --> 01:29:22,922
Military prison.

1673
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:26,059
What have you done?

1674
01:29:26,092 --> 01:29:29,095
Decoded Enigma intercepts.
I found a pile of them

1675
01:29:29,128 --> 01:29:32,865
- in the bedside table.
- No, no. I-I gave those to her

1676
01:29:32,898 --> 01:29:35,468
over a year ago when
I was trying to figure out

1677
01:29:35,501 --> 01:29:37,670
- a link between...
- I'm sure you did.

1678
01:29:37,703 --> 01:29:39,739
Denniston's been looking
for a Soviet spy.

1679
01:29:39,772 --> 01:29:42,676
He's been looking inside Hut 8.

1680
01:29:43,409 --> 01:29:45,111
I know who the spy is.

1681
01:29:46,445 --> 01:29:52,018
It's not Joan. It's...
it's Cairncross.

1682
01:29:52,051 --> 01:29:56,355
I-I found the Beale
cipher, the Bible.

1683
01:29:56,388 --> 01:29:59,392
God, I wish you'd been a spy.

1684
01:29:59,425 --> 01:30:02,495
You'd be so much better
at this than he is.

1685
01:30:02,528 --> 01:30:05,364
You knew it was him?

1686
01:30:05,397 --> 01:30:07,433
Of course I bloody knew.

1687
01:30:07,466 --> 01:30:09,669
I knew before
he came to Bletchley.

1688
01:30:09,702 --> 01:30:12,438
Why do you think
I had him placed here?

1689
01:30:12,471 --> 01:30:15,007
But we have an Enigma machine.

1690
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,743

01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:24,450
It's really quite useful
to be able

1694
01:30:24,483 --> 01:30:26,052
to leak whatever
we want to Stalin.

1695
01:30:26,085 --> 01:30:29,288
MENZIES VOICE-OVER:
Churchill's too damn paranoid.

1696
01:30:29,321 --> 01:30:31,524
He won't share a shred
of intelligence

1697
01:30:31,557 --> 01:30:33,693
with the Soviets.

1698
01:30:33,726 --> 01:30:36,896
Not even information that will
help them against the Germans.

1699
01:30:36,929 --> 01:30:40,467
SIGHS: There's...
so much secrecy.

1700
01:30:41,467 --> 01:30:44,570
Cairncross has no idea
we know, of course.

1701
01:30:44,603 --> 01:30:48,307
He's really not
the brightest bulb.

1702
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:49,709
Which is why I need your help.

1703
01:30:49,742 --> 01:30:52,145
I want to know
what to leak to John,

1704
01:30:52,178 --> 01:30:53,412
what to feed to the Soviets,

1705
01:30:53,445 --> 01:30:55,381
as well as the British.

1706
01:30:55,414 --> 01:30:58,851
SOFTLY: I... I'm not a spy.

1707
01:30:58,884 --> 01:31:02,522
I'm... I'm just a mathematician.

1708
01:31:03,289 --> 01:31:05,992
I know a lot of spies, Alan.

1709
01:31:06,025 --> 01:31:09,829
You've got more secrets
than the best of them.

1710
01:31:13,732 --> 01:31:17,603
You... you have to promise me
that you will release Joan.

1711
01:31:17,636 --> 01:31:19,505
Yes, Joan's at the market.

1712
01:31:19,538 --> 01:31:22,575
She's gonna be back
in an hour. I lied.

1713
01:31:23,309 --> 01:31:26,312
I better hold on to these.

1714
01:31:26,345 --> 01:31:27,713
If anybody finds out about them,

1715
01:31:27,746 --> 01:31:30,950
prison will be
the least of her worries.

1716
01:31:32,852 --> 01:31:34,720
Oh, Alan...

1717
01:31:34,753 --> 01:31:38,525
we're gonna have such a
wonderful war together.

1718
01:31:44,563 --> 01:31:46,532

1719

- Do you think it's any safer

1724
01:32:05,584 --> 01:32:06,986
- anywhere else?
- You need to get away.

1725
01:32:07,019 --> 01:32:08,754
You need to get
very far away from me.

1726
01:32:08,787 --> 01:32:11,257
Alan, what's happened?

1727
01:32:13,926 --> 01:32:15,962
We can't be engaged anymore.

1728
01:32:15,995 --> 01:32:18,331
You... your parents
need to take you back

1729
01:32:18,364 --> 01:32:20,934
and find you
a husband elsewhere.

1730
01:32:21,667 --> 01:32:24,003
What's wrong with you?

1731
01:32:25,437 --> 01:32:28,507
I have something,
uh, uh, to tell you.

1732
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:30,844
I'm...

1733
01:32:33,178 --> 01:32:35,582
I'm a homosexual.

1734
01:32:37,516 --> 01:32:39,385
All right.

1735
01:32:39,418 --> 01:32:44,123
No, no. M-Men, Joan...
uh, not women.

1736
01:32:44,156 --> 01:32:47,560
- So what?
- Well, I-I just told you.

1737
01:32:47,593 --> 01:32:49,863
So what?

1738
01:32:50,596 --> 01:32:51,764

1739
01:32:51,797 --> 01:32:54,500
I had my suspicions;
I always did.

1740
01:32:54,533 --> 01:32:56,636
But we're not like other people.

1741
01:32:56,669 --> 01:32:58,771
We love each other
in our own way,

1742
01:32:58,804 --> 01:33:01,240
and we can have the life
together that we want.

1743
01:33:01,273 --> 01:33:03,976
You-you... you won't be
the perfect husband.

1744
01:33:04,009 --> 01:33:05,611
Well, I can promise you,

1745
01:33:05,644 --> 01:33:07,980
I have no intention of
being the perfect wife.

1746
01:33:08,013 --> 01:33:10,716
I'll not be... fixing
your lamb all day

1747
01:33:10,749 --> 01:33:13,085
while you come home
from the office.

1748
01:33:13,118 --> 01:33:14,987
I'll work.

1749
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:17,056
You'll work.

1750
01:33:18,157 --> 01:33:21,360
And we'll have
each other's company.

1751
01:33:21,393 --> 01:33:23,095
We'll have each other's minds.

1752
01:33:23,128 --> 01:33:26,666
a better marriage than most.

1753
01:33:28,834 --> 01:33:32,138
Because I care for you.

1754
01:33:32,171 --> 01:33:35,775
And you care for me.

1755
01:33:35,808 --> 01:33:37,643
And we understand one another
more than...

1756
01:33:37,676 --> 01:33:40,647
more than anyone else ever has.

1757
01:33:42,047 --> 01:33:43,950
I don't.

1758
01:33:45,951 --> 01:33:49,622
- What?
- Care for you.

1759
01:33:49,655 --> 01:33:51,123
I never did.

1760
01:33:51,156 --> 01:33:53,993
I-I just needed you
to break Enigma.

1761
01:33:54,026 --> 01:33:57,664
I've done that now,
so... so you can go.

1762
01:34:02,768 --> 01:34:05,004
I'm not going anywhere.

1763
01:34:05,037 --> 01:34:07,573
I've spent entirely
too much of my life

1764
01:34:07,606 --> 01:34:09,642
worried about what
you think of me,

1765
01:34:09,675 --> 01:34:11,143
or what my parents think of me,

1766
01:34:11,176 --> 01:34:13,779
or the boys in Hut 8
or the girls in Hut 3.

1767
01:34:13,812 --> 01:34:15,581
And do you know what?
I'm done.

1768
01:34:15,614 --> 01:34:19,752
This is the most important
work I will ever do,

1769
01:34:19,785 --> 01:34:22,388
and no one is going to stop me.

1770
01:34:22,421 --> 01:34:24,157
Least of all, you.

1771
01:34:26,425 --> 01:34:29,562
You know what, they were right.

1772
01:34:29,595 --> 01:34:32,865
Peter, Hugh, John.

1773
01:34:35,501 --> 01:34:38,004
You really are a monster.

1774
01:34:40,205 --> 01:34:42,709

1775
01:34:49,281 --> 01:34:52,919

1776
01:34:54,853 --> 01:34:58,457
The war dragged on
for two more...

1777
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:01,827
solitary years...

1778
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:04,263
and every day we performed

1779
01:35:04,296 --> 01:35:07,867
our blood-soaked calculus.

1780
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:12,571
Every day we decided
who lived and who died.

1781
01:35:12,604 --> 01:35:13,906
Every day we...

1782
01:35:13,939 --> 01:35:18,311
helped the Allies to victories,
and nobody knew.

1783
01:35:19,678 --> 01:35:20,980

1784
01:35:21,013 --> 01:35:24,283
- Stalingrad.

1785
01:35:24,316 --> 01:35:25,584
The Ardenne.

1786
01:35:25,617 --> 01:35:27,053
The invasion of Normandy.

1787
01:35:27,086 --> 01:35:29,922
All victories that
would not have been possible

1788
01:35:29,955 --> 01:35:33,026
without the intelligence
that we supplied.

1789
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:35,561
And people...

1790
01:35:35,594 --> 01:35:40,166
talk about the war as
this epic battle between, um...

1791
01:35:40,199 --> 01:35:44,603
civilizations... freedom
versus tyranny,

1792
01:35:44,636 --> 01:35:49,542
democracy versus Nazism,
armies of millions

1793
01:35:49,575 --> 01:35:51,177
bleeding into the ground,

1794
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:55,214
fleets of ships
weighing down the oceans,

1795
01:35:55,247 --> 01:35:57,116
planes dropping bombs
from the sky

1796
01:35:57,149 --> 01:36:00,119
until they obliterated
the sun itself...

1797
01:36:00,152 --> 01:36:01,420

1798
01:36:01,453 --> 01:36:05,291
The war wasn't like that for us.

1799
01:36:06,425 --> 01:36:08,494
For us, it was just...

1800
01:36:09,862 --> 01:36:11,964
half a dozen
crossword enthusiasts

1801
01:36:11,997 --> 01:36:15,201
in a tiny village
in the South of England.

1802
01:36:15,234 --> 01:36:19,572
WINSTON CHURCHILL: This is...
your victory.

1803
01:36:19,605 --> 01:36:22,975
- Victory...

1804
01:36:23,008 --> 01:36:26,912
of the cause of freedom
in every land.

1805
01:36:26,945 --> 01:36:29,115

1806
01:36:31,150 --> 01:36:35,087
PRESIDENT TRUMAN: This is
a solemn but glorious hour.

1807
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:38,491
I wish that
Franklin D. Roosevelt

1808
01:36:38,524 --> 01:36:40,659
had lived to see this day.

1809
01:36:40,692 --> 01:36:42,294
TURING: Was I God?

1810
01:36:42,327 --> 01:36:47,266
No. Because... God
didn't win the war.

1811
01:36:47,299 --> 01:36:49,435
We did.

1812
01:36:53,338 --> 01:36:56,509

1813
01:36:56,542 --> 01:36:58,978

1814
01:37:01,813 --> 01:37:05,217
ALEXANDER: So, what happens now?

1815
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:09,455
Is it... back to university
for us, I suppose?

1816
01:37:09,488 --> 01:37:11,056
Yes, pretty much.

1817
01:37:11,089 --> 01:37:12,358
But you've one thing left to do

1818
01:37:12,391 --> 01:37:13,792
before your service
to your government

1819
01:37:13,825 --> 01:37:16,262
- in concluded.
- What's that?

1820
01:37:16,295 --> 01:37:17,997
Burn everything.

1821
01:37:18,030 --> 01:37:20,132
- Burn? Why?
- You were told when you started

1822
01:37:20,165 --> 01:37:25,070
this was a top-secret program...
did you think we were joking?

1823
01:37:25,103 --> 01:37:27,072
- But the war is over.
- TURING: This war is.

1824
01:37:27,105 --> 01:37:28,974
But there'll be others.

1825
01:37:29,007 --> 01:37:31,210
And we know how to break a code

1826
01:37:31,243 --> 01:37:34,747
that everybody else believes
is unbreakable.

1827
01:37:34,780 --> 01:37:37,183
MENZIES: Precisely.

1828
01:37:37,216 --> 01:37:39,785
Tear it down. Light it up.

1829
01:37:39,818 --> 01:37:40,886
Sweep away the ashes.

1830
01:37:40,919 --> 01:37:42,321
None of you have
ever met before.

1831
01:37:42,354 --> 01:37:44,256
None of you have ever even heard

1832
01:37:44,289 --> 01:37:46,893
the word Enigma.

1833
01:37:47,926 --> 01:37:51,130
Have a safe trip home.

1834
01:37:52,998 --> 01:37:56,302
MENZIES: Behave. With a bit
of luck, you'll never have

1835
01:37:56,335 --> 01:38:00,306
to see me or one another again
for the rest of your lives.

1836
01:38:14,953 --> 01:38:18,524
That's unbelievable.

1837
01:38:19,524 --> 01:38:25,264
SIGHS: Now, Detective,
you get to judge.

1838
01:38:26,698 --> 01:38:32,905
So, tell me... what am I?

1839
01:38:33,605 --> 01:38:36,709
Mm, am I... a machine?

1840
01:38:36,742 --> 01:38:39,311
Am I a person?

1841
01:38:39,344 --> 01:38:42,048
Am I a war hero?

1842
01:38:43,782 --> 01:38:46,586
Am I a criminal?

1843
01:38:49,688 --> 01:38:52,191
I can't judge you.

1844
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:57,263
Well, then...

1845
01:38:59,364 --> 01:39:03,135
you're no help to me at all.

1846
01:39:04,236 --> 01:39:06,705
VOICE-OVER: Come in.

1847
01:39:06,738 --> 01:39:09,075

1848
01:39:11,143 --> 01:39:13,712
You wanted to see me, sir?

1849
01:39:13,745 --> 01:39:15,514
Turing. Sit down.

1850
01:39:15,547 --> 01:39:19,118

1851
01:39:20,552 --> 01:39:22,622

1852
01:39:27,259 --> 01:39:29,828
Something the matter?

1853
01:39:29,861 --> 01:39:32,898
You and Christopher Morcom
are quite close.

1854
01:39:32,931 --> 01:39:34,166
I wouldn't say that.

1855
01:39:34,199 --> 01:39:35,567
Well, your mathematics teacher

1856
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,970
says the two of you
are positively inseparable.

1857
01:39:38,003 --> 01:39:40,306
We're the best students
in the class.

1858
01:39:40,339 --> 01:39:42,708
He caught you passing notes
the other day.

1859
01:39:42,741 --> 01:39:46,145
Cryptography, to pass the time.
The class is too simple.

1860
01:39:46,178 --> 01:39:49,848
You and your friend solve maths
problems during maths class

1861
01:39:49,881 --> 01:39:52,051
because the maths class
is too dull?

1862
01:39:52,084 --> 01:39:54,053
He's not my friend.

1863
01:39:54,086 --> 01:39:56,622
Well, I'm told
he's your only friend.

1864
01:39:56,655 --> 01:39:58,491
Who said that?

1865
01:40:00,392 --> 01:40:04,063
Something's come up
concerning Morcom.

1866
01:40:04,096 --> 01:40:06,732
Why am I here?

1867
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:12,204
Christopher is dead.

1868
01:40:12,904 --> 01:40:15,574

1869
01:40:18,510 --> 01:40:20,312
I don't understand.

1870
01:40:20,345 --> 01:40:22,448
His mother sent word
this morning.

1871
01:40:22,481 --> 01:40:25,418
The family were
on holiday, you see.

1872
01:40:29,054 --> 01:40:31,023
I don't understand.

1873
01:40:31,056 --> 01:40:33,826
Well, he had
bovine tuberculosis,

1874
01:40:33,859 --> 01:40:36,095
as I'm sure he told you.

1875
01:40:36,128 --> 01:40:38,731
So this won't come
as a shock, but...

1876
01:40:38,764 --> 01:40:43,736
still, all the same, I'm sorry.

1877
01:40:43,769 --> 01:40:46,839
You're mistaken.

1878
01:40:46,872 --> 01:40:49,308
Did he not tell you?

1879
01:40:49,341 --> 01:40:52,144
Well, he's been sick
for a long time.

1880
01:40:52,177 --> 01:40:54,913
He knew this was coming soon.

1881
01:40:54,946 --> 01:40:57,716
But he had a stiff
upper lip about it.

1882
01:40:57,749 --> 01:41:00,185
Good lad.

1883
01:41:00,218 --> 01:41:03,021
- Are you all right, Turing?
- Yes. Of course.

1884
01:41:03,054 --> 01:41:05,991
Like I said,
I didn't know him very well.

1885
01:41:06,024 --> 01:41:08,761
Ah. I see.

1886
01:41:08,794 --> 01:41:11,063
Very well.

1887
01:41:13,732 --> 01:41:16,469
May I leave, Headmaster?

1888
01:41:17,669 --> 01:41:20,039

1889
01:41:30,782 --> 01:41:33,419
Congratulations, sir.

1890
01:41:41,660 --> 01:41:43,829

1891
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:51,670

1892
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:57,276

1893
01:41:59,478 --> 01:42:01,213
Sorry.

1894
01:42:05,183 --> 01:42:07,186
I would have come.

1895
01:42:07,219 --> 01:42:09,087
I would have testified.

1896
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:11,890
And what would you have said,
that I, uh...

1897
01:42:11,923 --> 01:42:14,092
I wasn't a homosexual.

1898
01:42:14,125 --> 01:42:16,195
Alan... this is serious.

1899
01:42:16,228 --> 01:42:17,863
They could send you to jail.

1900
01:42:17,896 --> 01:42:20,265
Damn it.

1901
01:42:20,298 --> 01:42:23,068
Your hands. You're twitching.

1902
01:42:23,101 --> 01:42:25,571
No-no, I'm not.

1903
01:42:25,604 --> 01:42:27,239
- Alan.
- Uh...

1904
01:42:28,807 --> 01:42:31,577
It's the medication.

1905
01:42:31,610 --> 01:42:33,378
The medication?

1906
01:42:33,411 --> 01:42:36,915
Uh, well, the judge
gave me, um, a choice...

1907
01:42:36,948 --> 01:42:39,985
uh, ei-either
two years in prison

1908
01:42:40,018 --> 01:42:42,888
or... ho-hormonal therapy.

1909
01:42:42,921 --> 01:42:44,523
Oh, my God.

1910
01:42:44,556 --> 01:42:45,858
Oh, my God.

1911
01:42:45,891 --> 01:42:47,860
Yes, yes, that's right.

1912
01:42:47,893 --> 01:42:49,595
Chemical castration.

1913
01:42:49,628 --> 01:42:52,364
Um, to, uh, to cure me
of my, um...

1914
01:42:52,397 --> 01:42:54,833
CHUCKLES: Homosexual predilections.

1915
01:42:54,866 --> 01:42:57,102
Well, of course I chose that.

1916
01:42:57,135 --> 01:42:59,872
I mean, I... couldn't...

1917
01:42:59,905 --> 01:43:03,876
work in prison, and, uh...
All right.

1918
01:43:05,744 --> 01:43:07,613
Now, I-I'm going to
speak to your doctors.

1919
01:43:07,646 --> 01:43:10,816
I'm going to speak to your lawyers.
I'm... I'm fine.

1920
01:43:10,849 --> 01:43:14,253
Please let me help you. -No,
I, uh, don't need your help,

1921
01:43:14,286 --> 01:43:15,521
thank you.

1922
01:43:15,554 --> 01:43:18,190
Alan, you do not have
to do this alone.

1923
01:43:19,124 --> 01:43:21,527
I'm not alone.

1924
01:43:24,362 --> 01:43:27,633
Never have been.

1925
01:43:30,035 --> 01:43:33,539
Christopher's become so smart.

1926
01:43:36,041 --> 01:43:38,944
If-if I don't continue
my treatment,

1927
01:43:38,977 --> 01:43:41,547
then they'll, um...

1928
01:43:43,448 --> 01:43:46,552
they'll take him away from me.

1929
01:43:47,752 --> 01:43:49,555
You...

1930
01:43:51,423 --> 01:43:55,628
CRYING: You-you can't let
them do that. You can't.

1931
01:43:56,661 --> 01:44:00,399
You... you can't let
them leave me alone.

1932
01:44:01,666 --> 01:44:04,570
SOBBING: I don't...
I don't want to be alone.

1933
01:44:04,603 --> 01:44:08,040
- I don't want to be alone.
- All ri... all right, all right.

1934
01:44:08,073 --> 01:44:09,575
All right.

1935
01:44:10,609 --> 01:44:13,679
It's all right.
Come and sit down.

1936
01:44:13,712 --> 01:44:15,714

1937
01:44:15,747 --> 01:44:17,215
It's all right.

1938
01:44:17,248 --> 01:44:19,518
Come and sit down.

1939
01:44:20,685 --> 01:44:23,789
- It's all right.

1940
01:44:26,625 --> 01:44:29,261

1941
01:44:34,899 --> 01:44:36,668
Oh, well, that's a...

1942
01:44:36,701 --> 01:44:38,870
that's a much nicer ring

1943
01:44:38,903 --> 01:44:41,873
- than the one I-I made you.

1944
01:44:41,906 --> 01:44:44,242
Yes. His name's Jock.

1945
01:44:44,275 --> 01:44:47,779
He's an Army man, if
you can believe it.

1946
01:44:47,812 --> 01:44:51,617
- We work together.

1947
01:44:51,650 --> 01:44:52,718

1948
01:44:52,751 --> 01:44:56,455
Why don't we do
a crossword puzzle.

1949
01:44:56,488 --> 01:44:59,491
It'll only take us five minutes.

1950
01:44:59,524 --> 01:45:01,493
Or, in your case, six.

1951
01:45:06,231 --> 01:45:08,534
There.

1952
01:45:11,302 --> 01:45:13,905

1953
01:45:13,938 --> 01:45:16,542
Uh...

1954
01:45:22,013 --> 01:45:23,749

1955
01:45:23,782 --> 01:45:25,417
Uh...

1956
01:45:31,056 --> 01:45:33,458
Uh, p... perhaps later.

1957
01:45:33,491 --> 01:45:35,928
Yes, of course.

1958
01:45:40,632 --> 01:45:44,136
You-you got what
you wanted, didn't you?

1959
01:45:44,169 --> 01:45:47,172
Work, a husband.

1960
01:45:47,205 --> 01:45:50,342
Normal life.

1961
01:45:54,145 --> 01:45:55,447

1962
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:58,017

1963
01:45:59,484 --> 01:46:02,888
No one normal could
have done that.

1964
01:46:05,523 --> 01:46:07,459
Do you know, this morning...

1965
01:46:07,492 --> 01:46:10,662
I was on a train

1966
01:46:10,695 --> 01:46:13,465
that went through a city
that wouldn't exist

1967
01:46:13,498 --> 01:46:16,101
if it wasn't for you.

1968
01:46:16,134 --> 01:46:19,471
I bought a ticket from a man

1969
01:46:19,504 --> 01:46:23,275
who would likely be dead
if it wasn't for you.

1970
01:46:23,308 --> 01:46:27,312
I read up on my work...

1971
01:46:27,345 --> 01:46:31,116
a whole field of
scientific inquiry

1972
01:46:31,149 --> 01:46:34,687
that only exists because of you.

1973
01:46:37,122 --> 01:46:42,060
Now, if you wish you
could have been normal...

1974
01:46:42,093 --> 01:46:45,431
I can promise you I do not.

1975
01:46:46,831 --> 01:46:49,668
The world is an
infinitely better place

1976

precisely because you weren't.

1977
01:46:56,141 --> 01:47:00,746
Do you... do you
really think that?

1978
01:47:01,513 --> 01:47:05,584
I think... that sometimes
it is the people

1979
01:47:05,617 --> 01:47:08,286
who no one imagines anything of

1980
01:47:08,319 --> 01:47:14,226
who do the things that
no one can imagine.

1981
01:47:14,259 --> 01:47:16,628

1982
01:47:33,378 --> 01:47:35,714

1988
01:49:26,591 --> 01:49:29,027

1989
01:49:39,604 --> 01:49:42,007

1990
01:49:47,078 --> 01:49:50,282

1991
01:50:19,610 --> 01:50:22,281
