1
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:10,165
<i>For some, time passes slowly. </i>

2
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:13,467
<i>An hour can seem an eternity. </i>

3
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:17,306
<i>For others, 
there's never enough. </i>

4
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:20,972
<i>For the Tucks, it didn't exist. </i>

5
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:34,322
<i>Time is like a wheel... </i>

6
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,820
<i>turning and turning, 
never stopping</i>

7
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:45,497
<i>and the woods are the center, 
the hub of the wheel. </i>

8
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:00,644
<i>It began the first week
of summer</i>

9
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:06,454
<i>a strange and breathless time, 
when accident, or fate</i>

10
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:09,290
<i>bring lives together</i>

11
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:11,626
<i>when people are led
to do things</i>

12
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:14,132
<i>they've never done before. </i>

13
00:02:16,335 --> 00:02:21,136
<i>On this summer's day, 
not so very long ago</i>

14
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:26,805
<i>the wheel set lives in motion
in mysterious ways. </i>

15
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,178
<i>It set Mae Tuck out
in her wagon</i>

16
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,149
<i>for the village of Treegap</i>

17
00:02:31,183 --> 00:02:36,348
<i>to meet her two sons as she did
once every ten years. </i>

18
00:03:30,242 --> 00:03:32,176
Ma!

19
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,473
Miles!

20
00:03:33,512 --> 00:03:34,809
Jesse!

21
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,144
Oh...!

22
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:38,316
Oh, I missed you.

23
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,476
What are you doing here?

24
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:40,815
Oh, I couldn't wait to see you.

25
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:41,820
I missed you, Jesse.

26
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,321
Oh, wait,
I got something for you.

27
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:44,322
Oh, look at you.

28
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:45,323
I got something.

29
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:46,324
Here, look.

30
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:47,689
The Eiffel Tower.

31
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,955
Would you look at that.

32
00:03:48,994 --> 00:03:50,291
Got it in Paris, France.

33
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:51,762
Oh, Mom,
you've never seen anything

34
00:03:51,797 --> 00:03:53,128
- So tall in your life.
- Hello...

35
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:55,156
Oh, I got something else.
I got something else.

36
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,168
How are you, old friend?

37
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:57,499
Your favorite... chocolates.

38
00:03:57,536 --> 00:03:59,163
Oh, I've died
and gone to Heaven.

39
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,502
Oh, Jesse.

40
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:03,064
Miles...

41
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,568
Miles.

42
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,342
Give your mother a hug.

43
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:16,277
Ten years.

44
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,153
You're as cozy as barbed wire.

45
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:24,587
I have you back.

46
00:04:27,165 --> 00:04:30,601
Winifred!

47
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:32,797
Winifred!

48
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:35,170
Yes, Mother?

49
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:39,803
I need a new name.

50
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:42,575
One that's not all worn out
from being called so much.

51
00:04:44,883 --> 00:04:46,748
Come inside this instant.

52
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:48,013
You're getting filthy!

53
00:04:54,326 --> 00:04:55,816
Ow! I can scarcely breathe.

54
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:00,157
"You must suffer
to be beautiful."

55
00:05:00,198 --> 00:05:01,665
So say the French.

56
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,463
The French are crazy.

57
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,813
<i>For Winnie Foster
one thing was true: </i>

58
00:05:15,847 --> 00:05:18,873
<i>the heat of summer was not
nearly as stifling</i>

59
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:20,908
<i>as the formality of her life. </i>

60
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:29,456
<i>With every passing day</i>

61
00:05:29,494 --> 00:05:32,054
<i>the feeling grew stronger. </i>

62
00:05:32,097 --> 00:05:34,930
<i>She was coming closer
to the end of something</i>

63
00:05:34,966 --> 00:05:38,129
<i>and moving towards
the beginning of something new. </i>

64
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:52,314
<i>Change was in the air. </i>

65
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:58,152
<i>It was only a question of when. </i>

66
00:06:09,634 --> 00:06:11,363
Wait for me in the car.

67
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:12,927
I won't be a minute.

68
00:06:12,971 --> 00:06:15,439
In the car, Mrs. Foster.

69
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:19,038
Throw it home! Throw it home!

70
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:20,544
Come on, throw it home!

71
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:21,603
- Go!
- Run to me!

72
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:22,613
Yay!

73
00:06:22,647 --> 00:06:24,239
No, no, no, no, no.

74
00:06:24,282 --> 00:06:26,341
Too large for tea cakes.

75
00:06:26,384 --> 00:06:28,284
None of these will do.

76
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,845
I prefer petit fours.

77
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:33,858
What kind of a funny hat
is that?

78
00:06:33,892 --> 00:06:35,450
Well, look'ee here.

79
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:39,258
If it's not Miss Moneybags
in her fancy car.

80
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,325
What's the matter?

81
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,460
Don't want
to get your feet dirty?

82
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:48,463
Well, I'm sorry, Mrs. Foster.

83
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:50,634
Not much call
for such treats out here.

84
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:53,337
Well, I could just make them up
for you, special.

85
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:54,436
Winnie Foster?

86
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,946
You've got to be kidding!

87
00:06:55,981 --> 00:06:57,141
Wow!

88
00:06:57,182 --> 00:06:58,444
Winnie, run!

89
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:01,384
Run, Winnie, run!

90
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:03,717
Throw it! Throw it!

91
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:05,222
Throw it home! Come on!

92
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:06,952
Slide, Winnie, slide!

93
00:07:07,993 --> 00:07:09,620
Winifred!

94
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:37,148
Oh, and they had
their arms crossed

95
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:40,124
and you see, the lines
were perfectly square.

96
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:41,216
Come here, come here.

97
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:42,453
I want to teach you. Come on.

98
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:43,789
Oh, all the way from France.

99
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:44,989
How about that?

100
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,395
Oh, look. Look-Look at this one.

101
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,796
I want to see, Pop. Let me see.

102
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:48,800
Look it.

103
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:51,325
Oh! Aah, he shot me!

104
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:53,200
Oh, I'm dead!

105
00:07:53,238 --> 00:07:55,399
Oh, oh, my!

106
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,805
- Oh, my!

107
00:07:56,842 --> 00:07:58,810
Oh, you'll have to see this one.

108
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:00,471
Miles, look at this!

109
00:08:01,513 --> 00:08:04,073
Oh... let's see.

110
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:05,673
Okay, come here,
I want to show you.

111
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:06,911
I want to show you.

112
00:08:06,952 --> 00:08:08,112
All right.

113
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:14,217
Good to have you home, son.

114
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:16,921
I'm glad to see you.

115
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:21,592
And the family together.

116
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:24,295
But don't get used to it.

117
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:26,600
War's coming, I hear.

118
00:08:26,638 --> 00:08:29,266
I'm joining up.

119
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:32,765
I'm going to fight the Huns.

120
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:36,144
Get as far away
from this place as I can.

121
00:08:44,322 --> 00:08:49,954
Oh, you think
that'll solve things, do you?

122
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:54,830
You haven't had enough killing
for two lifetimes?

123
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:06,239
Somebody's on to us.

124
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:09,770
I know it.

125
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:17,378
<i>There's a man who's been
following us</i>

126
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:19,617
<i>and we've lost him
several times, but... </i>

127
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,857
<i>he keeps coming back. </i>

128
00:09:30,468 --> 00:09:35,667
<i>I think he knows something. </i>

129
00:09:39,311 --> 00:09:41,108
This man...

130
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:44,443
Jesse...

131
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:45,972
- Whoo!

132
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:49,043
We're being tracked.

133
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:53,455
Oh, Miles, we lost him.

134
00:09:53,558 --> 00:09:55,822
Don't go spoiling everything.

135
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,125
Yeah, we lost him, Jess...

136
00:09:59,164 --> 00:10:02,793
but he keeps coming back.

137
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:06,463
It was only a matter of time
before someone found us.

138
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:08,903
The world is closing in.

139
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:16,140
Entire forest is almost gone.

140
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:19,878
All except this little wood.

141
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:28,158
I saw tire marks down
on the lower wash...

142
00:10:28,193 --> 00:10:31,219
a few weeks ago.

143
00:10:31,262 --> 00:10:34,823
There'll be more.

144
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:37,232
I don't want anyone going
to town.

145
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:39,668
Not for anything,
and that's that.

146
00:10:39,704 --> 00:10:41,103
Tuck.

147
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:44,040
You see any strangers
in the woods getting too close

148
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:45,201
you know what to do.

149
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:48,041
No exceptions.

150
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:56,043
Our time here is almost done.

151
00:10:58,556 --> 00:11:02,754
I can feel it.

152
00:11:19,611 --> 00:11:22,580
You'll never catch one that way.

153
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,484
Do you know
about catching fireflies?

154
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:29,986
Afraid not, never tried.

155
00:11:30,021 --> 00:11:31,488
I prefer... bigger game.

156
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:33,150
Though I suspect the strategy

157
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:34,590
is much the same.

158
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:35,991
Strategy?

159
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:39,155
One must never announce
one's presence to the prey.

160
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:41,324
One must become part
of the scenery...

161
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:42,663
invisible...

162
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,261
almost disappear.

163
00:11:45,303 --> 00:11:48,272
And be patient

164
00:11:48,306 --> 00:11:51,070
until the exact, right moment

165
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:53,134
arrives...

166
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:59,008
Take a prisoner.

167
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,347
For you?

168
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:02,683
No, thank you.

169
00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:05,854
You're quite right.

170
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,451
A girl of your age
should find...

171
00:12:08,526 --> 00:12:09,993
trapping suitors
more interesting

172
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:11,427
than trapping insects, anyway.

173
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:14,955
Far easier, I might add.

174
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,232
Have you lived here long?

175
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,466
Forever. Why?

176
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:25,669
I'm... looking
for some old friends

177
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,144
who live hereabouts.

178
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:29,646
Thought you might
help me find them.

179
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:32,047
My father
practically built Treegap.

180
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,311
He knows everyone.

181
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:34,978
Perhaps he can help you.

182
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,146
Perhaps.

183
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:38,815
I quite like talking to you.

184
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:41,325
Winifred?

185
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:43,486
Winifred, who are you talking to
out there?

186
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:45,155
I don't know.

187
00:12:46,898 --> 00:12:49,833
He hasn't told me his name.

188
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:52,461
Good evening, madam.

189
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:54,472
Please forgive my intrusion.

190
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:57,100
This young lady tells me
you've lived here forever.

191
00:12:57,142 --> 00:12:59,406
I thought you might know
of a certain family

192
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:00,706
goes by the name of...

193
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:03,077
I hardly know everyone,
nor do I want to.

194
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:05,947
And I don't stand outside
discussing such a thing

195
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:07,576
with... strangers.

196
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:11,146
Then I beg your pardon.

197
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:12,713
Good evening, young lady.

198
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:14,748
Madam.

199
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:21,855
This is why I worry
about you, Winifred.

200
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:26,132
You don't have the sense
not to talk to a man like that.

201
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:34,205
<i>A proper education gains one
entré into society. </i>

202
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:37,908
<i>Your mother and I have given
this a great deal of thought. </i>

203
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:39,746
Middlehouse Academy for Girls

204
00:13:39,784 --> 00:13:42,582
in Pensford,
has an excellent reputation.

205
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,613
Middlehouse?

206
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:50,594
But that's a terrible place,
everyone says so.

207
00:13:50,628 --> 00:13:51,959
It's like a jail.

208
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:52,964
Nonsense.

209
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,831
Girls emerge from there
as refined young ladies

210
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:58,131
well-versed in etiquette
and manners,

211
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:00,296
both of which
you are sorely lacking.

212
00:14:00,338 --> 00:14:02,806
But I don't want to be
one of those girls.

213
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,309
Which is precisely why
you must go.

214
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:08,437
I cannot let
your unbridled nature

215
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,573
ruin your chances
for a respectable future.

216
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:13,209
Winifred... I'm sorry...

217
00:14:13,251 --> 00:14:17,312
but we have to do
what's best for you.

218
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:23,120
I won't do it.

219
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:24,753
I'm not like those girls.

220
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:25,763
I won't go!

221
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:26,855
Winifred!

222
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:28,991
I won't go!

223
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:44,475
<i>Winnie Foster was to be sent
500 miles away to be educated. </i>

224
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:47,950
<i>But what her parents didn't
understand</i>

225
00:14:47,986 --> 00:14:51,581
<i>was she only wanted to step
just outside her fence... </i>

226
00:14:51,623 --> 00:14:54,319
<i>so she did. </i>

227
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:06,763
<i>What in these quiet woods
should be so forbidden? </i>

228
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:11,839
<i>Winnie had always sensed
a mystery</i>

229
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:14,106
<i>waiting for her there. </i>

230
00:15:16,114 --> 00:15:22,849
<i>It was a place so entirely
different from what she knew</i>

231
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:26,254
<i>so far away from her tight, 
pruned world. </i>

232
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:29,586
Ah!

233
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:33,780
Ah...

234
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,150
How long have you been
standing there?

235
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,482
Not long at all.

236
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,681
I was only walking past,
and I...

237
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,658
Well, you shouldn't...

238
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:11,184
be in these parts of the woods.

239
00:17:11,229 --> 00:17:14,824
It's best you turn around
and go home.

240
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:21,969
Well, go on, now, get!

241
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:26,409
Excuse me,
but I own these woods, and...

242
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:29,106
I'll go on and get
when I want to.

243
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,374
You own these woods?

244
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:34,442
Yes, I do.

245
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:41,319
What's your name?

246
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,090
Winifred.

247
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,791
Winnie... Foster.

248
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:50,096
A Foster?

249
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,659
Well, I'll be.

250
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:54,672
Is that a fact?

251
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:58,233
Well... Winnie Foster,
like I was saying

252
00:17:58,276 --> 00:18:01,473
you need to turn around
and go home.

253
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:04,607
It just so happens
that I was on my way home

254
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:06,207
before you made
your rude suggestion

255
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,151
and I would be happy
to continue on my way

256
00:18:08,186 --> 00:18:11,519
if I only knew which way to go.

257
00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:14,047
In other words, you're lost?

258
00:18:16,227 --> 00:18:18,388
I'll point you home.

259
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,694
I'd be much obliged.

260
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,700
But I want a drink first.

261
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,201
Wait... no!

262
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:25,224
No!

263
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,396
What?

264
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,338
You don't want that water.

265
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:29,567
Uh, it's poisoned.

266
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:31,268
I saw you drink some.

267
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:33,334
Well, now I'm feeling sick.

268
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,278
You don't look ill.

269
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:36,439
I'm dry as dust.

270
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:39,608
I said, leave it alone!

271
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,085
Let go of me! My father
will have you arrested!

272
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,588
You're not going to go
and tell him, now, are you?

273
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:47,090
Hey! Come back!

274
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,786
Don't run away!

275
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,099
Come back!

276
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,234
Where you going so fast, Miss?

277
00:19:01,272 --> 00:19:03,399
Miles, wait!

278
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:05,703
- No! No!
- You know what Tuck said, Jesse.

279
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:06,937
- No exceptions.
- Help!

280
00:19:06,978 --> 00:19:08,639
You can't do this.

281
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,910
Stop! Let go!

282
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:11,916
We can't.

283
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,259
Miles!

284
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,875
Miss Foster!

285
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:22,281
Miss Foster!

286
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:27,889
Miss Foster!

287
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,486
Where are you?!

288
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:47,371
Ho.

289
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:51,337
We're stopping here.

290
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:55,051
- Not a word out of you, hear me?

291
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:57,077
Miles!

292
00:20:57,121 --> 00:20:58,713
- What are you doing?
- No!

293
00:20:58,756 --> 00:21:00,223
Let the poor girl go.

294
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:02,783
There's no reason
to be frightened, young lady.

295
00:21:04,028 --> 00:21:06,155
I caught her at the spring
with Jesse.

296
00:21:06,197 --> 00:21:07,255
She's a Foster.

297
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:09,960
Oh, Lord.

298
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:12,435
It's finally happened.

299
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,664
I want to go home, please.

300
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:14,865
I want to go home.

301
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:17,431
There, there, child.
Please don't cry.

302
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:19,568
We're not bad people.

303
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,340
We'll take you home
just as soon as we can.

304
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:23,040
I promise.

305
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,673
Miles, go find your father.

306
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,081
He's across the lake.

307
00:21:26,117 --> 00:21:28,176
He'll know what to do with her.

308
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:32,553
Tell Jesse I'm going to fix
that mouth of his.

309
00:21:53,711 --> 00:21:55,804
I've heard that.

310
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,041
Have you?

311
00:21:57,081 --> 00:22:01,381
It's, it's my little music box.

312
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:04,445
I found it
in the forest one day.

313
00:22:04,555 --> 00:22:06,819
Just waiting for me, I expect.

314
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:10,419
I've had it a long, long time.

315
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,227
Oh!

316
00:22:16,267 --> 00:22:19,430
I put my baby boys
to bed with it every night.

317
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,871
Gave 'em such sweet dreams.

318
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:34,942
I'm sure my boys
didn't mean you any harm.

319
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:38,353
Then why did they bring me here
this way?

320
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:39,583
Why am I here?

321
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,718
You have every right
to be upset.

322
00:22:43,761 --> 00:22:45,422
And I know your family
must be...

323
00:22:45,463 --> 00:22:46,657
worried sick about you.

324
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:50,966
Where's the child?

325
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:58,335
She's no child... Angus.

326
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:26,096
Does she know?

327
00:23:26,137 --> 00:23:27,365
Why do you think
I brought her...?

328
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:30,465
Yeah, but now she knows
about us, thanks to you.

329
00:23:30,508 --> 00:23:31,475
Shh! Shh!

330
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:32,907
She's a Foster,
she only knows...

331
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,707
Know what?

332
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,453
Miss Foster,
this is my husband, Angus Tuck.

333
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:50,154
Angus, meet Miss Foster.

334
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,233
Hello, Miss Foster.

335
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:03,563
She's the most important event

336
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,906
that's taken place in this house
in 80 years.

337
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:14,077
You hungry?

338
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:16,052
Oh, well, let's, let's all eat.

339
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,247
Yeah.

340
00:24:19,957 --> 00:24:21,925
Jesse, pass your mother
a plate, please?

341
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:23,358
Mmm, where's the fish?

342
00:24:23,394 --> 00:24:25,385
Oh, they weren't biting
for some reason.

343
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:27,158
'Cause Pa can't fish?

344
00:24:27,198 --> 00:24:29,166
Don't matter. There's plenty.

345
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,929
I catch fish.

346
00:24:30,968 --> 00:24:33,198
If there's no fish,
there's no fish

347
00:24:33,237 --> 00:24:35,432
if you keep scaring
the fish away.

348
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:38,131
Mmm, this looks good.

349
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,643
Oh! Isn't this nice?

350
00:24:39,677 --> 00:24:43,272
Everybody sitting down together
and having Miss Foster here.

351
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:45,407
It's just like having a party.

352
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:49,718
My father will come looking
for me.

353
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:54,748
Your father... will cut down
the entire forest

354
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:56,987
the way things are changing
around here.

355
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,655
Make himself a very rich man.

356
00:24:58,696 --> 00:25:01,995
Oh, now, let's not ruin
a perfectly good meal

357
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,432
with a lot of talk.

358
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,765
My father has plenty of money.

359
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:07,634
He'll pay.

360
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,934
Anything you want.

361
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:12,272
We don't want your father's
money, Miss Foster.

362
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,006
Then let me go home.

363
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,377
We will.

364
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:19,747
We'll let you go home...
just like I promised.

365
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:20,978
Directly.

366
00:25:21,018 --> 00:25:22,747
We'll need to be able
to trust her first

367
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:25,654
before we're sending her
back to her folks.

368
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,920
Trust her? We can't trust her.

369
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,551
Or any normal people.

370
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,858
She'll turn on us in a second.

371
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:34,023
No, she won't.

372
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,667
You're a fool.

373
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,868
You don't even realize
what you've done here.

374
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,982
Him.

375
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:28,008
It's him.

376
00:26:28,052 --> 00:26:30,020
Robert!

377
00:26:30,054 --> 00:26:31,715
I expect you to find her, Henry.

378
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,087
That's your job.

379
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,456
I've already wired her
description down the main line.

380
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:36,460
They'll keep a lookout

381
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,462
and we'll get up a search party
come morning.

382
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,828
My wife is certain that this man
wearing a yellow suit

383
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:43,026
has something to do
with Winifred's disappearance.

384
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:45,194
And Miss Foster says so
based on...?

385
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:47,803
Her instincts.

386
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,067
Hmm.

387
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,541
Well, maybe you better step
in here, Mr. Foster.

388
00:27:01,285 --> 00:27:04,049
Am I whom you're looking for?

389
00:27:04,088 --> 00:27:06,147
I do believe I fit
the description.

390
00:27:07,758 --> 00:27:11,159
My wife said she saw you
talking to my daughter.

391
00:27:11,195 --> 00:27:12,321
Yes, I did.

392
00:27:12,363 --> 00:27:15,423
She's a charming girl,
full of fire.

393
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:17,194
Perhaps too much.

394
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:19,828
She's gone, is she?

395
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:22,635
Looks like she... ran away.

396
00:27:22,673 --> 00:27:23,833
Did she now?

397
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,308
Somehow I'm not surprised.

398
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,971
My daughter did not... run away.

399
00:27:28,012 --> 00:27:30,742
And I'm not interested
in what surprises you, sir.

400
00:27:30,781 --> 00:27:33,181
I want to know
if you know anything

401
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:34,184
of her whereabouts.

402
00:27:34,218 --> 00:27:35,185
No, Mr. Foster.

403
00:27:35,219 --> 00:27:37,016
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I do not.

404
00:27:37,054 --> 00:27:41,013
I am quite coincidentally here
in search of someone myself.

405
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:42,184
I'm seeking a family

406
00:27:42,226 --> 00:27:43,853
that used to live
in these environs.

407
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,260
I thought the constable could

408
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,321
help me locate them,
but ironically, Mr. Foster

409
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:50,095
your daughter thought
you could help.

410
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:53,360
Name of Tuck.

411
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:55,031
Long lost relatives.

412
00:27:55,072 --> 00:27:57,506
l-I can't help you.

413
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:00,934
Nor I you.

414
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:06,174
At least not now.

415
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:11,748
However, I'd be happy

416
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:13,780
to search your woods
for you, Mr. Foster.

417
00:28:13,824 --> 00:28:15,689
I'm rather talented
at finding people.

418
00:28:15,726 --> 00:28:17,284
I just might meet with success.

419
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:18,590
Good evening, Constable.

420
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,032
Find out what happened
to her, Henry.

421
00:28:24,068 --> 00:28:26,866
Please.

422
00:28:26,904 --> 00:28:30,203
She's our only child.

423
00:28:34,078 --> 00:28:36,342
Angus made that cradle.

424
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,280
Brought it all the way
from Scotland.

425
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,841
Oh, it's rocked a few Tucks.

426
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,182
There you go.

427
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,587
The breeze off the lake
will keep you cool all night.

428
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:48,057
The boys sleep up in the loft
when they're home

429
00:28:48,092 --> 00:28:49,616
so you'll have your privacy.

430
00:28:50,828 --> 00:28:52,693
Oh, that corset looks painful.

431
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,561
May I help you off with it?

432
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:09,640
Oh, honestly, I can't understand

433
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,875
why women torture themselves
this way.

434
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,612
It's no way to live.

435
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,643
Do you have a daughter?

436
00:29:18,155 --> 00:29:19,747
A granddaughter.

437
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,382
And a grandson.

438
00:29:21,425 --> 00:29:25,088
Anna and Beau.

439
00:29:25,129 --> 00:29:27,962
Oh, Miles loved them so.

440
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:32,429
What happened?

441
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,903
They died.

442
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,338
Their mother, too.

443
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,968
I'm afraid the good parts
of Miles died along with them.

444
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,740
You'll have to forgive
what's left of him.

445
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:46,875
I'm sorry.

446
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:50,409
Well, it's... it's the way
things are, Miss Foster.

447
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:55,017
Can I call you Winnie?

448
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:59,790
Do you have brothers
and sisters?

449
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,458
No, it's only me.

450
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:03,465
My mother...

451
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,576
There.

452
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,771
So where do they go?

453
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:17,838
Oh, they go different places,
do different things.

454
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:21,079
Miles can do carpentry
and he's good with his hands.

455
00:30:21,118 --> 00:30:23,848
Jesse, now, he seems
to have settled himself.

456
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:25,378
Of course, then, he's...

457
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,414
he's young yet.

458
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,067
Well...

459
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,228
I hope you will be
comfortable here.

460
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:45,572
It's a good feeling
having another woman here.

461
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,979
Try and get some sleep now.

462
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,471
Hello?

463
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:20,672
Have you lost your way, friend?

464
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:23,111
Not hardly, Reverend.

465
00:31:25,182 --> 00:31:27,480
I'm looking
for a family name... Tuck.

466
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,212
Are you familiar with it?

467
00:31:29,253 --> 00:31:31,483
Tuck. Tuck?

468
00:31:31,555 --> 00:31:33,489
I'm afraid I can't help you.

469
00:31:33,557 --> 00:31:35,889
There are no Tucks
in this cemetery that I know of.

470
00:31:35,926 --> 00:31:36,984
No, I wouldn't think so.

471
00:31:37,027 --> 00:31:38,995
Ha!

472
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:40,656
Or in any other.

473
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:43,993
Tell me, Reverend

474
00:31:44,034 --> 00:31:46,832
you who have attended
so many deathbeds...

475
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,998
what is it people most desire

476
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,202
as they face the end
of their lives?

477
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,677
More time?

478
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:55,838
Well, I suppose.

479
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,745
Exactly.

480
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:01,775
They'd give almost anything,
I imagine, for one more year.

481
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:04,720
Imagine what they'd give
for all eternity.

482
00:32:04,755 --> 00:32:06,723
Sir, I don't quite understand
what...

483
00:32:06,757 --> 00:32:08,748
You will.

484
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:14,430
Reverend, are you prepared
to die right now, this instant?

485
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:15,830
If it's God's will.

486
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:17,197
What if it is my will?

487
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:23,799
What if you could be eternal?

488
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,833
Right now, this instant?

489
00:32:26,877 --> 00:32:29,038
Without having to face
the uncertainty of death?

490
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,239
Hmm?

491
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,112
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

492
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:33,377
No muss, no fuss.

493
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:36,580
Invincible to disease.

494
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:40,750
Never having to suffer
the stench and rot of old age.

495
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:43,021
Forever young.

496
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:48,088
You speak blasphemy, sir.

497
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,657
Fluently.

498
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,934
Good night, Reverend.

499
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:32,673
Hey, Winnie Foster, you asleep?

500
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:38,279
Not anymore.

501
00:33:38,315 --> 00:33:40,783
Good.

502
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:43,582
Hey.

503
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:45,589
Listen.

504
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:49,684
How would you like
to see the Eiffel Tower?

505
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,695
What?

506
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:52,923
Someday.

507
00:33:52,963 --> 00:33:54,931
No, now.

508
00:33:54,965 --> 00:33:57,525
While the day is still ours.

509
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:04,834
Get those dogs over there.

510
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:06,001
Yes, sir.

511
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:07,442
Come on, boys, let's go.

512
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,105
Henry, this is
Winifred's nightgown.

513
00:34:09,146 --> 00:34:10,443
Give it to the dog handlers.

514
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:11,539
Start in the north end.

515
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,345
Let's split up
when we get to the lake.

516
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,578
We'll find her.

517
00:34:14,618 --> 00:34:15,812
I know we will.

518
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,286
Winifred!

519
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:19,881
Miss Foster!

520
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:21,084
Winnie!

521
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:24,117
Winifred Foster!

522
00:34:24,161 --> 00:34:25,458
Miss Foster!

523
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,623
Winifred!

524
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:33,097
Over here!

525
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,162
I found something!

526
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:53,950
There it is.

527
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:56,585
This is the Eiffel Tower?

528
00:34:57,761 --> 00:35:00,924
The one in Paris,
it's pretty tall.

529
00:35:00,964 --> 00:35:03,626
Mine's two feet higher.

530
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:11,341
Here.

531
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,969
Come on.

532
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,070
Have you really seen
the real one in Paris?

533
00:35:16,113 --> 00:35:17,341
Yes, I have.

534
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:20,441
And climbed 1,652 stairs
to the top.

535
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,108
Much easier than this.

536
00:35:22,152 --> 00:35:23,278
Yes.

537
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,446
You doing all right?

538
00:35:24,488 --> 00:35:25,614
I think so.

539
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:26,782
You're doing great.

540
00:35:26,823 --> 00:35:29,724
Here.

541
00:35:31,628 --> 00:35:33,892
If I went to the Eiffel Tower

542
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,454
I would take
one of those elevators.

543
00:35:35,499 --> 00:35:36,659
Not with me.

544
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,065
You'd take off your shoes

545
00:35:38,101 --> 00:35:40,262
and walk up
every single solitary step.

546
00:35:42,005 --> 00:35:44,599
How old are you?

547
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:47,474
Do you really want to know?

548
00:35:47,511 --> 00:35:51,277
Yes.

549
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,748
104.

550
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,876
I'm serious.

551
00:35:54,918 --> 00:35:57,682
So am I.

552
00:35:57,721 --> 00:36:00,519
Let's just call it 17.

553
00:36:06,463 --> 00:36:09,261
There's my Paris.

554
00:36:09,299 --> 00:36:14,760
The view from the Eiffel Tower
can't be better than this.

555
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:21,472
I've seen a lot of views,
and this is one of the best.

556
00:36:59,983 --> 00:37:01,951
Come on.

557
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:11,715
<i>Winnie Foster was beginning
to lose track of time. </i>

558
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:18,527
<i>Had she been there a day, 
a week, a month? </i>

559
00:38:22,098 --> 00:38:26,125
<i>It seemed to Winnie
that the Tucks lived in a way</i>

560
00:38:26,169 --> 00:38:28,899
<i>the rest of the world
had forgotten. </i>

561
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:35,309
<i>They were never in a hurry
and did things the slow way. </i>

562
00:38:48,158 --> 00:38:50,456
<i>For the first time</i>

563
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:57,093
<i>Winnie felt free to explore, 
to ask questions, to play. </i>

564
00:39:24,294 --> 00:39:26,421
Me?

565
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:29,261
I'm going to see the world.

566
00:39:29,299 --> 00:39:30,596
Every speck of it.

567
00:39:30,633 --> 00:39:35,161
Heck, I may even find some
new continents or something.

568
00:39:37,974 --> 00:39:41,432
I mean, I've been
to a lot of places

569
00:39:41,511 --> 00:39:45,504
but the world is huge!

570
00:39:48,685 --> 00:39:51,449
Jesse Tuck,
what-what are you doing?

571
00:39:51,488 --> 00:39:56,983
What does it look like?

572
00:40:04,434 --> 00:40:06,368
Woo-hoo!

573
00:40:10,006 --> 00:40:12,998
Woo! Ah, whoo.

574
00:40:17,213 --> 00:40:18,908
Come on!

575
00:40:18,948 --> 00:40:20,142
I can't!

576
00:40:20,183 --> 00:40:21,480
Why?

577
00:40:21,518 --> 00:40:23,816
You're not afraid of a little
cold water, are you?

578
00:40:23,853 --> 00:40:25,150
No.

579
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:26,485
<i>Are you afraid of me? </i>

580
00:40:26,523 --> 00:40:28,286
No.

581
00:40:28,324 --> 00:40:30,224
Well, what then?

582
00:40:33,363 --> 00:40:35,160
I can't swim.

583
00:40:35,198 --> 00:40:37,166
You're joshing me.

584
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,895
I wish I were.

585
00:40:38,935 --> 00:40:41,733
So, you're afraid you'll drown,
right?

586
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:47,869
Swallow too much water,
sink to the bottom and die.

587
00:40:47,911 --> 00:40:50,004
Thank you for putting it
so vividly.

588
00:40:50,046 --> 00:40:52,514
And, yes,
considering I'd sink like a rock

589
00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:54,176
drowning is a fair concern.

590
00:40:54,217 --> 00:40:58,517
Well, I guess I'm just going
to have to enjoy this

591
00:40:58,555 --> 00:41:01,183
all by myself.

592
00:41:01,224 --> 00:41:02,953
Hmm...

593
00:41:02,992 --> 00:41:04,425
Hmm!

594
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,306
Ah, Jesse!

595
00:41:25,348 --> 00:41:26,315
Hey, hey, it's okay.

596
00:41:26,349 --> 00:41:27,976
Come here, come here, come here.

597
00:41:28,017 --> 00:41:30,315
I've got you, I've got you.

598
00:41:30,353 --> 00:41:32,480
I've got you, relax.

599
00:41:32,522 --> 00:41:33,989
Relax against me.

600
00:41:34,023 --> 00:41:35,149
You all right?

601
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:37,318
I think so.

602
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,157
Whoo!

603
00:41:39,195 --> 00:41:41,322
You did it!

604
00:41:41,364 --> 00:41:43,491
I did it!

605
00:41:43,533 --> 00:41:45,330
Ah, it feels wonderful.

606
00:41:45,368 --> 00:41:47,996
I'm weightless.

607
00:41:48,037 --> 00:41:50,335
That's 'cause we're
carrying you, see?

608
00:41:50,373 --> 00:41:52,841
The water and me.

609
00:41:52,876 --> 00:41:55,504
We're both carrying you.

610
00:41:55,545 --> 00:41:56,842
You like the feeling?

611
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,212
I love it.

612
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:03,280
Jesse, don't let go!

613
00:42:03,319 --> 00:42:05,617
It's okay, it's okay.

614
00:42:05,655 --> 00:42:08,283
There's no chance of that,
Winnie Foster.

615
00:42:08,324 --> 00:42:12,818
I'm never going to let you go.

616
00:43:33,843 --> 00:43:36,778
You know, I don't like
being laughed at by a cheat.

617
00:43:40,516 --> 00:43:42,609
Now "cheat" is a nasty word,
sir.

618
00:43:44,287 --> 00:43:47,450
I much prefer "card sharp."

619
00:44:00,737 --> 00:44:03,763
You are looking for trouble,
aren't you, mister?

620
00:44:03,806 --> 00:44:05,433
Yes, sir, I sure am.

621
00:44:05,475 --> 00:44:06,703
Going outside!

622
00:44:06,743 --> 00:44:07,710
Come on!

623
00:44:07,744 --> 00:44:09,109
Perhaps next time...

624
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,469
Come on!

625
00:44:13,816 --> 00:44:16,876
He can't hurt me!

626
00:44:19,355 --> 00:44:21,448
Whoo!

627
00:44:28,665 --> 00:44:29,791
Thank you.

628
00:44:29,832 --> 00:44:33,165
Thank you very much.

629
00:44:40,176 --> 00:44:41,666
Excuse me, citizen.

630
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:02,324
You hear that?

631
00:45:02,365 --> 00:45:04,765
Tuck says
it's the most melancholy sound

632
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:06,428
in all of nature.

633
00:45:06,469 --> 00:45:08,437
Listen.

634
00:45:08,471 --> 00:45:11,099
Just listen.

635
00:45:18,014 --> 00:45:21,142
They're playing for you.

636
00:45:57,553 --> 00:45:58,747
Whoo! Yeah!

637
00:47:05,788 --> 00:47:10,418
I wish this moment
could last forever.

638
00:47:10,459 --> 00:47:14,088
Forever?

639
00:47:14,129 --> 00:47:16,427
You want to spend forever
with me, Winnie?

640
00:47:16,465 --> 00:47:19,798
I do.

641
00:47:23,138 --> 00:47:27,268
You know, we could see
the world together.

642
00:47:27,309 --> 00:47:31,268
We could do
everything together.

643
00:47:31,313 --> 00:47:34,771
Have a million moments
like this one that...

644
00:47:34,817 --> 00:47:37,650
never, never stop.

645
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:46,291
There's a part about us
you don't know...

646
00:47:46,328 --> 00:47:49,627
the part I've sworn
not to tell you.

647
00:47:49,665 --> 00:47:51,292
The secret?

648
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:55,702
The reason you don't want anyone
to find out about you?

649
00:47:55,738 --> 00:47:56,864
I knew it.

650
00:47:56,906 --> 00:48:00,865
You're... you're bank robbers
or grifters.

651
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:03,401
You are the first human
I've ever met

652
00:48:03,445 --> 00:48:05,310
I wanted to know the truth.

653
00:48:05,848 --> 00:48:10,911
Jesse Tuck, you're the first
human I've ever met

654
00:48:10,953 --> 00:48:14,582
that I've ever wanted to...

655
00:48:14,623 --> 00:48:16,454
to...

656
00:48:19,628 --> 00:48:22,529
...to do that.

657
00:48:34,877 --> 00:48:37,869
Winnie, listen.

658
00:48:37,913 --> 00:48:39,141
Remember the giant oak tree

659
00:48:39,181 --> 00:48:40,978
at the center of the wood
where we met?

660
00:48:41,016 --> 00:48:46,955
The little spring bubbling up
you saw me drink from?

661
00:48:46,989 --> 00:48:50,425
You remember when I told you
I was 104 years old?

662
00:48:51,827 --> 00:48:53,385
Well...

663
00:48:53,429 --> 00:48:56,865
it's the honest truth.

664
00:49:03,405 --> 00:49:06,067
I'm going to live forever.

665
00:49:06,108 --> 00:49:07,871
I'm never going to change.

666
00:49:09,778 --> 00:49:11,746
The same with Miles
and Tuck and Mae.

667
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,577
Something happened to us.

668
00:49:13,616 --> 00:49:16,551
As far as I know, I'm...
I'm going to be 17

669
00:49:16,585 --> 00:49:18,576
until the end of the world.

670
00:49:18,621 --> 00:49:21,681
It's the spring, Winnie.

671
00:49:21,724 --> 00:49:24,420
The water,
something's wrong with it.

672
00:49:24,493 --> 00:49:26,859
It stops you
right where you are.

673
00:49:26,895 --> 00:49:29,887
If you had a drink of it today,
you'd stay just like you are.

674
00:49:36,138 --> 00:49:40,268
Don't you wish he'd told you...

675
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:42,300
before you kissed him?

676
00:49:42,344 --> 00:49:44,369
Did he tell you

677
00:49:44,413 --> 00:49:47,348
immortality isn't all the
preachers crack it up to be?

678
00:49:47,382 --> 00:49:49,714
Hey, leave her alone, Miles.

679
00:49:49,751 --> 00:49:53,118
Oh, now... you want her
to hear it, Jesse boy.

680
00:49:53,155 --> 00:49:57,091
She's the first person
you want to tell the truth to.

681
00:49:57,125 --> 00:50:00,458
You just don't want me
to have what you lost.

682
00:50:00,496 --> 00:50:02,225
Stop this...

683
00:50:03,098 --> 00:50:05,794
...both of you

684
00:50:05,834 --> 00:50:07,631
and tell me the truth.

685
00:50:07,669 --> 00:50:08,931
I want to know.

686
00:50:15,177 --> 00:50:17,873
We all had a drink...

687
00:50:19,748 --> 00:50:24,185
...except for the cat...
that's important.

688
00:50:28,257 --> 00:50:32,318
<i>The water tasted like... </i>

689
00:50:32,361 --> 00:50:34,989
<i>Heaven. </i>

690
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:38,124
<i>Floated over your tongue
like a cloud. </i>

691
00:50:40,135 --> 00:50:43,434
<i>Tuck carved a "T" in the trunk, 
to mark where we'd been. </i>

692
00:50:43,472 --> 00:50:46,407
<i>We moved on west, looking
for a place to settle down. </i>

693
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:50,644
<i>Put up a house for Mae and Tuck</i>

694
00:50:50,679 --> 00:50:53,910
and a little shed
for Jesse and me.

695
00:50:56,652 --> 00:51:02,454
That was the first time we
figured there was something...

696
00:51:03,825 --> 00:51:05,793
peculiar.

697
00:51:07,195 --> 00:51:10,892
Jesse fell 30 feet,
landed right on his neck.

698
00:51:12,434 --> 00:51:14,163
He was up on his feet again

699
00:51:14,202 --> 00:51:16,432
before Mae could work up
a good cry.

700
00:51:16,471 --> 00:51:19,702
Didn't hurt him a bit.
No broken bones... nothing.

701
00:51:21,777 --> 00:51:23,870
That's not all.

702
00:51:25,914 --> 00:51:28,678
Not by a long shot.

703
00:51:29,918 --> 00:51:32,443
Things began to happen.

704
00:51:34,189 --> 00:51:35,679
Some brushpoppers mistook

705
00:51:35,724 --> 00:51:38,420
<i>Mae's horse for a deer. </i>

706
00:51:38,527 --> 00:51:41,291
Thing is,
the bullets didn't kill him.

707
00:51:42,497 --> 00:51:45,796
Barely even left a mark.

708
00:51:45,834 --> 00:51:47,392
<i>Then Tuck got bitten</i>

709
00:51:47,436 --> 00:51:50,166
by a rattlesnake,
and you know what?

710
00:51:50,205 --> 00:51:52,002
He didn't die...

711
00:51:53,942 --> 00:51:55,933
...but the cat did

712
00:51:55,978 --> 00:51:58,139
of old age.

713
00:52:12,827 --> 00:52:14,886
And Miles got married.

714
00:52:16,998 --> 00:52:20,229
Daddy!

715
00:52:39,187 --> 00:52:40,518
Beau.

716
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:46,451
<i>Little Anna. </i>

717
00:52:48,463 --> 00:52:50,363
Tuck figured it early on.

718
00:52:50,398 --> 00:52:53,333
It's the spring.

719
00:52:53,368 --> 00:52:57,702
<i>We all drank from it, 
even the horse. </i>

720
00:53:00,041 --> 00:53:06,446
<i>Had to be... the source
of our changelessness. </i>

721
00:53:12,987 --> 00:53:15,251
I begged her to come back...
for me

722
00:53:15,289 --> 00:53:17,780
and find the spring
and drink from it.

723
00:53:17,825 --> 00:53:19,452
The children, too.

724
00:53:19,494 --> 00:53:22,088
It was our only hope
to be together.

725
00:53:34,876 --> 00:53:36,366
<i>She made up her mind</i>

726
00:53:36,411 --> 00:53:38,845
<i>I'd sold my soul
to the Devil... </i>

727
00:53:40,615 --> 00:53:42,606
<i>... and she left me. </i>

728
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:45,619
<i>She took my babies with her. </i>

729
00:53:53,628 --> 00:53:57,064
Everyone...
pulled away after that.

730
00:53:57,098 --> 00:54:02,331
<i>There was talk of witchcraft... 
black magic. </i>

731
00:54:24,325 --> 00:54:27,692
I went looking for wars
to fight...

732
00:54:27,728 --> 00:54:33,257
and I saw brave men die
at Vera Cruz...

733
00:54:33,301 --> 00:54:35,826
and then Gettysburg...

734
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:40,204
thousands,
in the blink of an eye...

735
00:54:43,211 --> 00:54:46,510
...but not me.

736
00:54:46,547 --> 00:54:48,538
I couldn't die...

737
00:54:51,552 --> 00:54:53,076
...like little Anna.

738
00:54:56,124 --> 00:55:01,084
The influenza took her
before she's 15.

739
00:55:01,129 --> 00:55:03,029
And Beau.

740
00:55:03,064 --> 00:55:05,259
<i>He'd be almost 80 now</i>

741
00:55:05,299 --> 00:55:07,290
if he were still alive.

742
00:55:16,811 --> 00:55:18,369
And my sweet...

743
00:55:22,483 --> 00:55:25,384
...my sweet young bride.

744
00:55:28,489 --> 00:55:31,617
She died in an insane asylum...

745
00:55:33,594 --> 00:55:35,926
...old and alone.

746
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:41,625
But I'm still here.

747
00:55:43,638 --> 00:55:44,935
I'm still here.

748
00:56:40,428 --> 00:56:43,886
Winnie Foster, you're the only
other person in the world

749
00:56:43,932 --> 00:56:45,923
who knows about us.

750
00:56:49,938 --> 00:56:51,735
We'll have to have a talk.

751
00:56:51,773 --> 00:56:53,240
Pa.

752
00:56:53,274 --> 00:56:54,935
Come on.

753
00:57:20,368 --> 00:57:22,529
Look around you.

754
00:57:25,673 --> 00:57:27,641
It's teeming life.

755
00:57:27,675 --> 00:57:30,974
It's flowers and trees
and frogs.

756
00:57:31,012 --> 00:57:34,573
It's... it's all part
of the wheel.

757
00:57:34,616 --> 00:57:37,585
It's always changing;
it's always growing

758
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:39,086
like you, Winnie.

759
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:43,352
Your life is never the same.

760
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:47,691
You were once a child.

761
00:57:47,729 --> 00:57:51,392
Now, you are
about to become a woman.

762
00:57:51,499 --> 00:57:53,091
One day, you'll grow up

763
00:57:53,134 --> 00:57:55,398
and you'll do
something important.

764
00:57:55,503 --> 00:57:58,631
You'll have children,
maybe, and then one day

765
00:57:58,673 --> 00:58:01,972
you'll go out...

766
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:03,978
just like the flame of a candle.

767
00:58:04,012 --> 00:58:05,843
You'll make way for new life.

768
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,177
That's a certainty.

769
00:58:07,215 --> 00:58:10,082
That's the natural way
of things.

770
00:58:10,118 --> 00:58:12,018
And then, there's us.

771
00:58:12,053 --> 00:58:16,012
What we Tucks have,
you can't call it living.

772
00:58:16,057 --> 00:58:19,026
We just... are.

773
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:23,053
We're like rocks,
stuck at the side of a stream.

774
00:58:24,966 --> 00:58:25,955
Listen to me.

775
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,730
Winnie, you know
a dangerous secret.

776
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:30,260
If people find out
about the spring

777
00:58:30,304 --> 00:58:31,828
they'll trample
all over each other

778
00:58:31,873 --> 00:58:32,840
to get to that water.

779
00:58:32,874 --> 00:58:35,741
There's one thing I've learned
about people.

780
00:58:35,777 --> 00:58:38,678
<i>Many will do anything,
anything not to die</i>

781
00:58:38,713 --> 00:58:42,342
and they'll do anything
to keep from living their life.

782
00:58:42,383 --> 00:58:47,150
Do you want
to stay stuck as you are

783
00:58:47,188 --> 00:58:50,180
right now, forever?

784
00:58:53,194 --> 00:58:56,061
I've just got
to make you understand.

785
00:58:58,066 --> 00:59:00,159
I don't want to die.
Is that wrong?

786
00:59:00,201 --> 00:59:02,499
No.

787
00:59:02,537 --> 00:59:06,166
No human does...

788
00:59:06,207 --> 00:59:09,506
but i-it's part of the wheel...

789
00:59:09,544 --> 00:59:12,308
the same as being born.

790
00:59:12,346 --> 00:59:16,578
You can't have living
without dying.

791
00:59:16,617 --> 00:59:20,781
Don't be afraid of death,
Winnie.

792
00:59:20,822 --> 00:59:24,815
Be afraid of the unlived life.

793
01:00:00,994 --> 01:00:02,985
Your tea, sir.

794
01:00:11,338 --> 01:00:12,805
She's with them now.

795
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:14,807
I came directly here,

796
01:00:14,841 --> 01:00:17,139
knowing how tormented
you must be.

797
01:00:17,177 --> 01:00:19,145
We-we just want her back safely.

798
01:00:19,179 --> 01:00:20,578
Course you do.

799
01:00:20,614 --> 01:00:22,912
Dreadful business, kidnapping.

800
01:00:22,949 --> 01:00:25,918
Fortunate I was witness.

801
01:00:25,952 --> 01:00:28,921
I'm perhaps the only person...

802
01:00:28,955 --> 01:00:30,946
who knows where to find her.

803
01:00:34,895 --> 01:00:38,126
Just what is your game, sir?

804
01:00:38,165 --> 01:00:39,826
What is my game?

805
01:00:41,835 --> 01:00:43,769
<i>You detect in me a playful mood?</i>

806
01:00:43,804 --> 01:00:46,500
"Playful" is not
the word I had in mind.

807
01:00:48,809 --> 01:00:52,267
What I have in mind
is a simple, clear-cut trade.

808
01:00:52,312 --> 01:00:54,872
You see,
I very much like your woods

809
01:00:54,915 --> 01:00:58,942
not for their timber, mind you

810
01:00:58,985 --> 01:01:01,818
but for their natural assets.

811
01:01:01,855 --> 01:01:03,880
Wh-What is it you want?

812
01:01:03,924 --> 01:01:06,893
<i>You want your daughter.</i>

813
01:01:06,927 --> 01:01:09,760
I want your woods.

814
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:14,733
You're involved in this,
aren't you?

815
01:01:14,768 --> 01:01:16,292
If you have touched
my daughter...!

816
01:01:17,704 --> 01:01:20,002
I have my faults, Mr. Foster.

817
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,167
Kidnapping is not amongst them.

818
01:01:24,177 --> 01:01:27,044
These are rough people,
the ones who took her.

819
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,014
No telling what they might do.

820
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:37,148
Unless we do what you say.

821
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:40,182
Give the man whatever he wants.

822
01:01:51,137 --> 01:01:52,604
Done and done.

823
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:55,802
Nice to have things legal
and tidy, don't you agree?

824
01:01:55,842 --> 01:01:58,902
You're an intelligent,
reasonable man, Mr. Foster.

825
01:01:58,945 --> 01:02:01,470
I'm seldom wrong
as a judge of character.

826
01:02:03,483 --> 01:02:05,678
Have your friendly constable
on hand

827
01:02:05,719 --> 01:02:07,687
to make
the appropriate arrests.

828
01:02:07,721 --> 01:02:10,281
Your terrible ordeal is
as good as over.

829
01:02:10,323 --> 01:02:12,018
I'll get there before you.

830
01:02:12,058 --> 01:02:13,821
We have to move quickly.

831
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,919
They were packing to leave.

832
01:02:18,498 --> 01:02:22,025
<i>What kind of horrible people
must these kidnappers be? </i>

833
01:02:22,068 --> 01:02:24,696
<i>HENRY:
There is evil in the world, 
Mr. Foster. </i>

834
01:02:24,738 --> 01:02:27,468
<i>There aren't fences high enough
to keep it out. </i>

835
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:30,065
<i>Bring your men
directly to my house. </i>

836
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:31,441
<i>I'm going with you. </i>

837
01:02:57,537 --> 01:02:59,596
It isn't fair, Tuck.

838
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:01,106
No, it isn't...

839
01:03:01,141 --> 01:03:03,803
but when has life
ever been fair?

840
01:03:08,815 --> 01:03:10,806
How am I going to take you home

841
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:13,819
when I can't make my feet move
from this spot?

842
01:03:16,489 --> 01:03:19,151
If I could die tomorrow,
I'd do it...

843
01:03:19,192 --> 01:03:21,956
just to spend one more night
with you.

844
01:03:21,995 --> 01:03:24,759
Forgive me for interrupting
such a tender moment.

845
01:03:29,269 --> 01:03:32,033
Hello, Winifred.

846
01:03:32,072 --> 01:03:35,974
Everyone's been so worried
about you.

847
01:03:36,009 --> 01:03:38,807
I'm relieved
to find you so well.

848
01:03:38,845 --> 01:03:40,540
You know this man?

849
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:42,070
I met him once.

850
01:03:50,423 --> 01:03:53,984
Hello, Mr. Tuck.

851
01:03:54,027 --> 01:03:58,691
You have no idea what a pleasure
it is to meet you.

852
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:03,292
You're the man
who's been following my boys.

853
01:04:07,107 --> 01:04:08,734
Been expecting you.

854
01:04:08,775 --> 01:04:11,744
Yes, and here I am.

855
01:04:11,778 --> 01:04:15,680
Tell me, is it a relief...
to finally be discovered?

856
01:04:15,715 --> 01:04:20,345
Over a century of hiding out
must have taken its toll on you.

857
01:04:20,387 --> 01:04:22,048
Who are you?

858
01:04:24,057 --> 01:04:26,423
And how do you know so much
about us?

859
01:04:26,459 --> 01:04:30,725
I first heard about your family
from my grandmother.

860
01:04:30,764 --> 01:04:33,756
She knew a woman
in a mental facility

861
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:37,497
who used to...
rant and ramble about a family

862
01:04:37,537 --> 01:04:40,301
who never grew old
and never died.

863
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:43,605
This woman,
she used to call out a name.

864
01:04:43,643 --> 01:04:45,270
What was it, now?

865
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,608
Anna.

866
01:04:46,646 --> 01:04:48,238
Crazy old woman.

867
01:04:48,281 --> 01:04:51,682
Kept on talking
about a music box.

868
01:04:51,718 --> 01:04:55,313
It seems the melody had a
calming effect on her children.

869
01:04:55,355 --> 01:04:57,414
I'm sure you know it, Mrs. Tuck?

870
01:05:09,469 --> 01:05:11,960
You have no right...

871
01:05:12,005 --> 01:05:16,567
to come to our home...
and bring us such pain.

872
01:05:16,609 --> 01:05:19,100
There, good mother.

873
01:05:19,145 --> 01:05:21,170
I mean no harm.

874
01:05:22,882 --> 01:05:26,943
Tell us, sir.

875
01:05:26,986 --> 01:05:29,284
What is it you want?

876
01:05:29,322 --> 01:05:33,452
Well, you see, the Fosters
have given me these woods

877
01:05:33,493 --> 01:05:35,825
in exchange
for bringing young Winifred

878
01:05:35,862 --> 01:05:36,954
back home to them.

879
01:05:36,996 --> 01:05:39,396
I have the papers,
all signed and legal.

880
01:05:39,466 --> 01:05:41,400
Gives me the rights
to the forest

881
01:05:41,501 --> 01:05:42,798
and everything in it.

882
01:05:42,836 --> 01:05:44,133
Don't be alarmed.

883
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:47,139
I'll let you stay here...
on my land

884
01:05:47,173 --> 01:05:49,300
if you prove cooperative.

885
01:05:49,342 --> 01:05:51,401
Cooperative?

886
01:05:51,444 --> 01:05:54,106
I want you to take me
to the spring.

887
01:05:58,218 --> 01:06:00,345
I don't know what you mean.

888
01:06:00,386 --> 01:06:02,047
Don't insult me, Mr. Tuck.

889
01:06:02,088 --> 01:06:03,919
It's immediately clear to me

890
01:06:03,957 --> 01:06:06,926
that the water's powers
have been wasted on...

891
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,928
unimaginative people like you.

892
01:06:08,962 --> 01:06:10,930
I intend to make

893
01:06:10,964 --> 01:06:13,990
this fountain of youth,
as the simpletons would call it

894
01:06:14,033 --> 01:06:16,024
available to those
who deserve it...

895
01:06:16,069 --> 01:06:18,037
for a price, of course.

896
01:06:18,071 --> 01:06:23,634
You'll die of old age
before I'll take you.

897
01:06:23,676 --> 01:06:25,109
Is that so?

898
01:06:25,145 --> 01:06:26,669
Then, perhaps Winifred will!

899
01:06:26,713 --> 01:06:27,645
No!

900
01:06:28,848 --> 01:06:30,008
Jesse!

901
01:06:47,233 --> 01:06:49,224
Yes!

902
01:06:49,269 --> 01:06:51,260
Bravo!

903
01:06:57,443 --> 01:06:58,910
Come now, Winifred.

904
01:06:58,945 --> 01:07:00,037
I'm feeling thirsty.

905
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:01,637
Show me where the spring is.

906
01:07:01,681 --> 01:07:03,740
Perhaps I'll let you have
a drink.

907
01:07:03,783 --> 01:07:05,273
After all...

908
01:07:06,386 --> 01:07:10,322
...then we can spend...
eternity together.

909
01:07:29,309 --> 01:07:31,106
Winnie, Winnie, come here.

910
01:07:31,144 --> 01:07:34,409
It's okay. It's okay, I gotcha.

911
01:07:46,226 --> 01:07:47,887
Pa.

912
01:08:00,807 --> 01:08:03,571
There they are!

913
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:05,510
Winnie Foster!

914
01:08:05,545 --> 01:08:06,944
I see her!

915
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:08,880
I got her!

916
01:08:08,915 --> 01:08:11,110
Circle around to the right!

917
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:12,117
Watch the water!

918
01:08:12,151 --> 01:08:13,209
Go!

919
01:08:13,253 --> 01:08:14,277
Don't let anyone get away!

920
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,753
Jesse, come on.

921
01:08:15,788 --> 01:08:16,755
Winnie!

922
01:08:16,789 --> 01:08:17,778
Block that trail!

923
01:08:17,824 --> 01:08:18,791
It's my father.

924
01:08:20,693 --> 01:08:22,991
Keep them alive!

925
01:08:24,931 --> 01:08:27,263
Be careful of the girl!
Winnie!

926
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:28,961
Let's go!

927
01:08:30,937 --> 01:08:32,871
Wait...

928
01:08:36,276 --> 01:08:37,243
Get on.

929
01:08:37,277 --> 01:08:38,972
Behind the house, men!

930
01:08:39,012 --> 01:08:41,674
He's setting the house on fire!

931
01:08:41,714 --> 01:08:43,341
Winnie!

932
01:08:43,383 --> 01:08:45,374
You're all right.
You're all right.

933
01:08:46,452 --> 01:08:48,249
We found you. You're safe.

934
01:08:48,288 --> 01:08:49,380
You're safe now.

935
01:08:49,422 --> 01:08:51,014
Everything's all right.

936
01:08:51,057 --> 01:08:52,024
Winnie.

937
01:08:53,059 --> 01:08:54,549
Hyah!

938
01:09:23,122 --> 01:09:27,422
<i>The hall clock chimed the hour. </i>

939
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:31,089
<i>Outside, the wind was still. </i>

940
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:34,429
<i>Everything, it seemed, 
was waiting. </i>

941
01:10:12,571 --> 01:10:15,563
We just want to understand
what happened.

942
01:10:16,609 --> 01:10:20,978
Winnie... try, please.

943
01:10:26,852 --> 01:10:29,821
They didn't kidnap me.

944
01:10:29,855 --> 01:10:32,483
I was with them
because I wanted to be.

945
01:10:32,525 --> 01:10:34,891
- She doesn't know

946
01:10:34,927 --> 01:10:36,554
what she's saying.

947
01:10:36,595 --> 01:10:38,927
The Tucks were kind to me.

948
01:10:38,964 --> 01:10:40,932
They're my friends.

949
01:10:40,966 --> 01:10:42,866
If they didn't kidnap you,
why on earth

950
01:10:42,902 --> 01:10:45,735
did that woman club that man
over the head with a shotgun?

951
01:10:45,771 --> 01:10:48,035
Because Mae Tuck
was protecting me.

952
01:10:48,074 --> 01:10:49,769
Doesn't matter anyway.

953
01:10:49,809 --> 01:10:52,573
That fella died.
It's a murder charge now.

954
01:10:52,611 --> 01:10:54,306
I didn't much like the man

955
01:10:54,346 --> 01:10:57,543
but that won't stop
that poor woman from hanging.

956
01:10:57,583 --> 01:11:00,746
Miss is an eyewitness.

957
01:11:00,786 --> 01:11:03,084
She'll have to testify.

958
01:11:03,122 --> 01:11:04,646
Oh, my God.

959
01:11:10,496 --> 01:11:12,691
<i>I figured you might want this. </i>

960
01:11:12,731 --> 01:11:15,461
Doesn't exist,
far as I'm concerned.

961
01:11:16,669 --> 01:11:19,638
I sure am sorry about all this.

962
01:11:19,672 --> 01:11:20,639
Good day.

963
01:11:20,673 --> 01:11:22,334
Thank you, Henry.

964
01:11:56,876 --> 01:11:58,867
Winnie.

965
01:12:01,147 --> 01:12:03,115
Jesse!

966
01:12:03,149 --> 01:12:05,640
Oh, it's you.

967
01:12:05,684 --> 01:12:08,346
I was afraid
I would never see you again.

968
01:12:08,387 --> 01:12:09,877
I need you to help me.

969
01:12:09,922 --> 01:12:12,550
<i>I need you to help us. </i>

970
01:12:12,591 --> 01:12:15,219
Mae can't go to the gallows.

971
01:12:15,261 --> 01:12:16,888
She won't die.

972
01:12:16,929 --> 01:12:18,954
She can't die.

973
01:12:18,998 --> 01:12:22,593
They're going to find out
our secret.

974
01:12:22,635 --> 01:12:25,069
We have to get them out.

975
01:12:42,788 --> 01:12:43,755
Help me!

976
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:45,757
Please, help me!

977
01:12:45,791 --> 01:12:46,758
Somebody, help me!

978
01:12:46,792 --> 01:12:48,657
Please, someone help!

979
01:12:49,795 --> 01:12:50,762
Please! Help!

980
01:12:50,796 --> 01:12:51,922
All right.

981
01:12:51,964 --> 01:12:53,591
Help me, please!

982
01:12:53,632 --> 01:12:54,690
All right!

983
01:12:54,733 --> 01:12:55,700
Help!

984
01:12:55,734 --> 01:12:57,759
PI... Please!

985
01:12:57,803 --> 01:12:59,668
Help me! You have to stop them!

986
01:12:59,705 --> 01:13:00,729
They're after me!

987
01:13:00,773 --> 01:13:03,037
<i>Miss F... Miss Fo...
Who's after you?</i>

988
01:13:03,075 --> 01:13:04,133
The people who kidnapped me!

989
01:13:04,176 --> 01:13:05,541
They're going
to take me away again!

990
01:13:05,578 --> 01:13:06,738
My parents couldn't stop them!

991
01:13:06,779 --> 01:13:08,406
They're right outside!

992
01:13:08,447 --> 01:13:10,711
You have to stop them, please!

993
01:13:10,749 --> 01:13:11,716
Help!

994
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:13,342
They'll kill me if they find me!

995
01:13:13,385 --> 01:13:15,410
Please, they're going
to kill me, please!

996
01:13:15,454 --> 01:13:16,580
Stay right there!

997
01:13:16,622 --> 01:13:17,782
I'll handle this.

998
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:19,120
Hurry!

999
01:13:20,659 --> 01:13:23,389
Help!

1000
01:13:39,478 --> 01:13:41,412
Come out and meet your doom!

1001
01:13:42,948 --> 01:13:44,142
Hell is upon you!

1002
01:13:48,153 --> 01:13:50,485
Stop right there!

1003
01:13:52,491 --> 01:13:54,118
You're under arrest!

1004
01:13:57,463 --> 01:13:59,988
Come on, we have to hurry.

1005
01:14:00,032 --> 01:14:02,262
The boys are outside.

1006
01:14:02,301 --> 01:14:03,928
Stay back, now!

1007
01:14:03,969 --> 01:14:06,301
I'll shoot!

1008
01:14:57,156 --> 01:14:59,124
My dear, sweet Winnie.

1009
01:14:59,158 --> 01:15:02,025
What I wouldn't do to keep you.

1010
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:09,196
I wish you were ours...
for Jesse.

1011
01:15:09,234 --> 01:15:12,533
For all of us.

1012
01:15:12,571 --> 01:15:16,439
You have to hurry
and get away from here.

1013
01:15:16,542 --> 01:15:19,170
Winnie...

1014
01:15:19,211 --> 01:15:21,202
Winnie, come with me.

1015
01:15:21,246 --> 01:15:22,440
There's nothing for you here.

1016
01:15:22,514 --> 01:15:23,674
We can be together forever.

1017
01:15:23,716 --> 01:15:26,708
If she comes with us,
they'll hunt us down.

1018
01:15:26,752 --> 01:15:28,686
They'll never stop looking.

1019
01:15:28,721 --> 01:15:29,779
Tuck is right.

1020
01:15:29,822 --> 01:15:31,084
If I go with you

1021
01:15:31,123 --> 01:15:34,092
it'll be too dangerous
for all of you.

1022
01:15:36,729 --> 01:15:39,493
I can't go without you.

1023
01:15:46,872 --> 01:15:48,863
You have to.

1024
01:15:52,745 --> 01:15:54,770
Go back to the spring.

1025
01:15:54,813 --> 01:15:56,405
Drink from it.

1026
01:15:56,482 --> 01:15:59,781
When it's safe...
I'll come back for you.

1027
01:15:59,818 --> 01:16:01,410
Will you?

1028
01:16:01,453 --> 01:16:03,785
I have to show you
the Eiffel Tower, don't I?

1029
01:16:03,822 --> 01:16:08,259
1,652 steps to the top.

1030
01:16:08,293 --> 01:16:09,590
Winnie...

1031
01:16:09,628 --> 01:16:12,529
until we're together again...

1032
01:16:12,564 --> 01:16:14,794
wake up with the dawn.

1033
01:16:14,833 --> 01:16:17,563
I will.

1034
01:16:17,603 --> 01:16:20,697
We got to go...
before it's too late.

1035
01:16:33,652 --> 01:16:35,847
Winnie Foster...

1036
01:16:36,955 --> 01:16:39,947
I will love you
till the day I die!

1037
01:17:26,672 --> 01:17:28,936
She's going fast

1038
01:17:28,974 --> 01:17:31,636
but you can have a couple
of minutes with her.

1039
01:17:35,547 --> 01:17:36,946
How are you?

1040
01:18:13,652 --> 01:18:15,711
"...and to Almighty God

1041
01:18:15,754 --> 01:18:18,689
"we commend the soul
of our sister

1042
01:18:18,724 --> 01:18:22,057
"and we commit her body
to the ground.

1043
01:18:22,094 --> 01:18:29,057
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust..."

1044
01:18:31,437 --> 01:18:33,701
"...Resurrection

1045
01:18:33,739 --> 01:18:35,832
"through our Lord Jesus Christ;

1046

"at whose coming in glorious

01:18:39,645 --> 01:18:42,876

1052
01:19:09,108 --> 01:19:11,099
Mother?

1053
01:19:13,112 --> 01:19:15,080
I was just wondering

1054
01:19:15,114 --> 01:19:18,106
what it is about these woods
you love so much.

1055
01:19:23,989 --> 01:19:26,287
Mother, are you all right?

1056
01:19:35,134 --> 01:19:37,932
I'm going to miss her, too.

1057
01:19:39,471 --> 01:19:41,939
Oh...

1058
01:19:41,974 --> 01:19:45,933
Every time I look at you,
you're different.

1059
01:19:47,646 --> 01:19:49,307
I'm losing you, too.

1060
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:03,151
I'm right here.

1061
01:20:08,267 --> 01:20:10,258
Forgive me, Winnie.

1062
01:20:12,337 --> 01:20:15,465
I just wanted to keep you
my little girl forever.

1063
01:20:47,105 --> 01:20:49,972
<i>Go back to the spring. </i>

1064
01:20:50,008 --> 01:20:53,774
<i>When it's safe, 
I'll come back for you. </i>

1065
01:21:00,152 --> 01:21:04,111
<i>ANGUS:
What we Tucks have, 
you can't call it living. </i>

1066
01:21:04,156 --> 01:21:07,455
<i>We just... are. </i>

1067
01:21:07,492 --> 01:21:12,657
<i>We're like rocks stuck
at the side of a stream. </i>

1068
01:21:30,515 --> 01:21:34,007
<i>The first weeks of summer
were long over. </i>

1069
01:21:36,455 --> 01:21:38,082
<i>There was a feeling</i>

1070
01:21:38,123 --> 01:21:40,455
<i>that the wheel
was turning again... </i>

1071
01:21:42,794 --> 01:21:45,786
<i>... slowly now, 
but soon to go faster. </i>

1072
01:21:52,804 --> 01:21:56,467
<i>Winnie and her family
left Treegap to see the world. </i>

1073
01:22:02,481 --> 01:22:06,440
<i>She wasn't certain
what herjourney might bring</i>

1074
01:22:06,485 --> 01:22:08,453
<i>but this much she knew... </i>

1075
01:22:08,553 --> 01:22:12,148
<i>it would be something
of her own choosing. </i>

1076
01:22:52,797 --> 01:22:56,893
<i>For some, time passes slowly. </i>

1077
01:22:56,934 --> 01:23:01,030
<i>An hour can seem an eternity. </i>

1078
01:23:01,072 --> 01:23:05,771
<i>For others, 
there's never enough. </i>

1079
01:23:05,810 --> 01:23:10,247
<i>For Jesse Tuck, 
it didn't exist. </i>

1080
01:24:27,491 --> 01:24:32,451
<i>Tuck said it to Winnie
the summer she turned 15:</i>

1081
01:24:32,496 --> 01:24:37,729
<i>Do not fear death, 
but rather the unlived life. </i>

1082
01:24:37,768 --> 01:24:40,828
<i>You don't have to live forever. </i>

1083
01:24:40,871 --> 01:24:43,066
<i>You just have to live. </i>

1084
01:24:43,107 --> 01:24:45,439
<i>And she did. </i>
