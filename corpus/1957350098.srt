guys on those two homicides.MEYER. Go.

685
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:00,066
KLING: Ice.

686
00:41:03,156 --> 00:41:05,854
There are already too many
people in this city

687
00:41:05,898 --> 00:41:08,161
who are afraid to go out
after dark.

688
00:41:08,204 --> 00:41:11,512
And then when you have a murder
right outside the theater,

689
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:14,036
really sends a negative message.

690
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,170
So you were in Philadelphia
at the time of the homicide?

691
00:41:17,213 --> 00:41:18,606
CARTER: Yes, I was.

692
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,608
CARELLA: Philadelphia'’s only
an hour train ride away.

693
00:41:20,652 --> 00:41:23,393
Have you got witnesses
to put you there at
nine o'’clock?

694
00:41:23,437 --> 00:41:25,874
I was in the rear of
the Majestic Theater

695
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:28,790
with my staff, taking notes.

696
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:30,575
We'’re trying out
a new comedy.

697
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:33,360
Unfortunately we'’re not going to
be able to bring it in.

698
00:41:33,403 --> 00:41:35,623
Well, that'’s too bad. Then
there won'’t be any "ice."

699
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,625
CARTER: Pardon me?

700
00:41:37,669 --> 00:41:40,019
CARELLA: Is that word unfamiliar
to you, Mr Carter?

701
00:41:40,062 --> 00:41:41,281
"Ice?"

702
00:41:41,324 --> 00:41:43,196
Look, let'’s not waste
each other'’s time.

703
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:46,286
We both know that Sally
was acting as a courier
for your bootleg tickets.

704
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:48,375
CARTER: I think
I'’d better speak
to my lawyer.

705
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:49,985
You gentleman can leave now.

706
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:52,292
CARELLA: Sure.

707
00:41:52,335 --> 00:41:54,686
Then we'’ll talk to someone
from the IRS.

708
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,079
And then we'’ll come back.

709
00:41:57,123 --> 00:41:59,386
CARTER: Look! Humph, come on.

710
00:41:59,429 --> 00:42:01,344
Let'’s not make a big issue
out of this, huh?

711
00:42:01,388 --> 00:42:04,130
It'’s the old law
of supply and demand. No one
gets harmed by it.

712
00:42:04,173 --> 00:42:08,613
Yeah but seeing as it was
illegal, that would leave
somebody open to blackmail.

713
00:42:08,656 --> 00:42:11,964
CARTER: The way you just
threatened me by invoking IRS.MEYER: Mm-hmm.

714
00:42:12,007 --> 00:42:14,053
CARELLA: Is that what happened
Mr. Carter?

715
00:42:14,096 --> 00:42:17,317
CARELLA: Did Sally threaten to
blow the whistle on you?CARTER: Absolutely not.

716
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,712
The girl took a very modest
commission and never caused me
any trouble at all.

717
00:42:20,755 --> 00:42:23,410
MEYER: What about drugs?
Ever see her do any cocaine?

718
00:42:23,453 --> 00:42:25,281
Never.

719
00:42:25,325 --> 00:42:27,762
I have very strict rules about
the use of drugs in
all of my shows.

720
00:42:27,806 --> 00:42:29,590
MEYER: Admirable.

721
00:42:29,634 --> 00:42:31,766
Of course I can'’t vouch for,
what goes on backstage
every night.

722
00:42:33,246 --> 00:42:35,553
Why don'’t you ask the gypsies?

723
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:36,858
You know, the chorus kids.

724
00:42:36,902 --> 00:42:39,382
Oh, they love to tell tales
out of school.

725
00:42:39,426 --> 00:42:41,428
CARELLA: That'’s our
very next stop.

726
00:42:41,471 --> 00:42:44,953
CARTER: Well, since you'’re going
to the theater you might as well
enjoy the show.

727
00:42:44,997 --> 00:42:47,608
I'’d be pleased to offer you
complimentary house seats.

728
00:42:47,652 --> 00:42:49,262
MEYER: Hmm, very nice of you.

729
00:42:49,305 --> 00:42:52,308
My wife and I, we don'’t get out
much. Kind of addicted to TV.

730
00:42:52,352 --> 00:42:55,007
But, what about you? You could
take Teddy, for your
anniversary.

731
00:42:57,444 --> 00:42:59,402
Yeah, uhm...

732
00:42:59,446 --> 00:43:01,579
Is it too late to get tickets
for tonight?

733
00:43:01,622 --> 00:43:05,017
CARTER: Not a problem at all.
They'’ll be at the box office,
in your name.

734
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,280
I'’d have to pay for,
the tickets.

735
00:43:07,323 --> 00:43:08,847
Whatever makes you happy,
Detective.

736
00:43:09,674 --> 00:43:10,675
Please, pay for them.

737
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:16,768
CARELLA: Let'’s say little Sally
needed seed money

738
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:18,857
to buy all this
high grade stuff.

739
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,989
Shakes down the sleazy producer,

740
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:22,817
threatens to turn him into
Uncle Sam.

741
00:43:22,861 --> 00:43:25,646
Thereby, acquiring her
venture capital.

742
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:28,997
Yeah, naturally if Paco
found out he'’d try
shaking down Mr. Carter,

743
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:31,217
giving Carter motive
to kill the both of them.

744
00:43:32,784 --> 00:43:34,176
Smug son of a bitch!

745
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,962
CARELLA: I'’d like to nail him.MEYER: Me too.

746
00:43:42,054 --> 00:43:45,274
Mind if I stop by the
art gallery, tell Teddy about
the theater tickets?

747
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:47,799
Nah, uh...
how does she uh...

748
00:43:47,842 --> 00:43:49,452
get the play? Does she read
the lips?

749
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,977
If we'’re sitting close enough.

750
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,240
Otherwise I sign it to her.

751
00:43:54,283 --> 00:43:57,460
You must be getting
pretty good at that, uh?

752
00:43:57,504 --> 00:44:00,942
We communicate better
than people talk out loud.

753
00:44:00,986 --> 00:44:03,031
I guess it'’s like
being married
twenty years.

You get inside

to anybody.

That'’ll be a hundred and fifty
dollars.

763
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:30,537
Seventy five each.

I can get a lower price for the

of us about the murder.

I'’ve been busting my butt
to get on TV.
