Oh, man.

Well, I'ma get me
something to eat.

Lots of things inside.

184
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,631
Hot dogs, barbeque.

185
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:02,635
No, I'ma get me
something fresh.

186
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,471
Something right
off the vine.

Need some changes
around here.

WP 273645.

I got into my place okay

like you told me to do.

I'll see you Monday morning.
Bye.

Hey!

Good little radio, isn't it?

205

Yes, ma'am.

206
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,409
How about that rabbit?

207
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,581
Dollar.

208
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:30,283
How 'bout 50 cents?

Okay.

00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,633
Candy here?

213
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,568
Nope, she don't
live here no more.

214
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,804
Damn, she got
$10 I loaned her.

215
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,673
I got these shoes
on layaway...

216
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:56,309
She really cleaned
the place out, didn't she?

217
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,777
Mm-hmm.
Who are you?

218
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,545
Oh, I'm Ruby from next door.

219
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,846
We share that wall.

220
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,848
Oh.

221
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:06,852
You, uh,
Candy's sister, Arlie?

222
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,421
Arlene.

223
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,856
She didn't leave you
no sheets or nothing?

224
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,459
Nope, took everything.

You just got out.

227
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,666
I-I seen them
dresses before.

228
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,702
Yep, prison issued.

229
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:26,372
But they're clean.
(laughing)

230
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:27,740
You sure there ain't
no envelope

231
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,575
laying around here with
my name on it or nothin'?

232
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,777
I ain't seen none.

233
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,379
She didn't have much,
you know.

234
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,648
She didn't do nothin'
here except sleep.

235
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:38,351
Well, I was thinking
she might come by.

236
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:40,519
I ain't seen her since
she was a scrawny little kid

237
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,522
in seventh grade.
Honey, she ain't
coming back.

238
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,191
He keeps all hi...

239
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:48,561
I mean, his place
is far away from here.

240
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,563
But...

241
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,331
But what?

242
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,567
Well, she had a lot
of friends, you know?

243
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:55,901
And some of them might
be stopping by.

244
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,471
Men, you mean?

245
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,473
Yeah.

246
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,842
Aw, Candy...

247
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,911
Well, I-I shouldn't
have said nothing.

248
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,314
But I didn't want you surprised
if some John came by here

249
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,249
with his tongue
hangin' out and all.

250
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,155
I wouldn't
have been surprised.

251
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,860
You need anything,
you just knock.

252
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,896
Okay,
thank you.

253
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,664
Nice meeting you.

254
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,277
(knocking on door)

255
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:41,213
(mother)
Arlie? You in there?
Open the door.

256
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,284
Arlie, what's taking
you so long?

257
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,420
(dog barking,
knocking continues)

258
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,855
I'm coming, Mama!

259
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,590
(mother)
I brung you
a bunch of stuff.

260
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,859
I ain't gonna stand here
holding it all day.

261
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,499
I didn't know
if you'd come.

262
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,435
Ain't I always?

263
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,878
How are you, Mama?

264
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,814
About the same.

265
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,617
I'm glad to see you.

266
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:19,819
You look tired.

267
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:23,823
Well, I ain't woke up yet.

268
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:27,693
Wish I could sleep
till 10:00.

269
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:31,430
(sighs)

270
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,766
Filthy dirty.

271
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,734
Well, I brought you
all kinds of stuff.

272
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,603
It's just like Candy
to go away

273
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,638
and leave you nothing.

274
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:42,007
Here, I brought you some
pickle loaf and bologna.

275
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,776
Oh, thanks, Mama.

276
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,583
Did you know...

277
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,519
Candy was hookin'?

278
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,920
(scoffs)

279
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,457
She'd been doing it
since day one.

280
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,960
Don't worry about it.

281
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,562
You got three weeks
free rent, don't you?

282
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,599
(fridge shuts)

283
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:17,376
You still making that pot roast
like you used to, Mama?

284
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,912
Them little potatoes
with no skins?

285
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:23,082
You always made
the best pot roast.

286
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:25,451
Everybody said so.

287
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,487
Well, I do
on special occasions.

288
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,857
Me coming home, Mama?
Ain't that special?

289
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:37,029
I got no time to
make fancy meals for you.

290
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,464
Your daddy's sick.

291
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:50,609
He wadn't a mean man,
your daddy.

292
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:01,720
I said, your daddy
wasn't a mean man.

293
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,359
Hey, they cut out
your tongue or something?

294
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,004
Can I fix you
something, Mama?

295
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,639
No, I ain't gonna
be here that long.

296
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,509
Why, I thought we co--
Well, I gotta work.

297
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:27,479
Somebody in this family's
gotta work, Arlie girl.

298
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,716
Mama...

299
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,986
I ain't Arlie no more.

300
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:37,590
I'm Arlene now.
That's what people call me.

301
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:45,497
Bible says be humble.

302
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,435
Meek.

303
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:51,070
Patient.

304
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,205
Bearing with
one another in love.

305
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,140
Chaplain taught me that.

306
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:07,019
You done the best you could
by my boy Joey, Mama.

307
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,955
You took care of him
for three years.

308
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,625
Driving cab,
and cooking and cleaning,

309
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,793
and taking care
of Daddy, too.

310
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,096
I didn't have...

311
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:20,766
No cause for gettin' mad
like I did, but--

312
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,702
Givin' up a kid
ain't the end of the world.

313
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:26,839
Now, June and Candy put out
two kids that way.

314
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:36,949
It wasn't your fault
I lost him, it was mine.

315
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:38,150
I was the one in prison.

316
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,852
I was the one who'd done
what I done.

317
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,887
I did it, and that's that.

318
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,623
You didn't never get
attached to him, anyway.

319
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,897
Anyways,
I ain't mad no more.

320
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,268
I just wanna know why...
(faucet running)

321
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,936
(faucet stops running)

322
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,739
... you didn't tell me
you was gonna give him up.

323
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:03,075
I done what was best for him.

324
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:05,511
Now, it wasn't gonna do
anybody any good

325
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:06,779
for you to raise a fuss.

326
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,213
It would've done me
some good.

327
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:11,517
Me writin' all them letters,
and him not even there.

328
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:13,085
Well, I wrote you,
didn't I?

329
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:14,620
A year after you
give him up.

330
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,088
Yeah,
and what did you do, huh?

331
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:19,191
Go and try and burn
yourself up, didn't you?

332
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,660
Try and beat
the devil to it.

333
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:25,197
Now you got nothin'
to worry about.

334
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,766
No kids, no worry.

335
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:34,273
Where is he, Mama?

336
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,709
Now your sister June
is out to here.

337
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,677
Doesn't know when
to stop, that girl.

338
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,012
'Course, I ain't one to talk.

339
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:42,114
Mama--
I bought you
these dish towels.

340
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:45,250
Bet they didn't have no colored
dish towels where you been--

341
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,152
Mama, I asked you
a question.
Where is he?

342
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,254
I don't know
where he is!

343
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:56,261
I saw him about a year ago.

344
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,897
You seen him?

345
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,232
Well, what'd he look like?

346
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,201
Just a skinny little thing.

347
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:04,603
I don't know,
I didn't stop.

348
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:07,873
I was takin' my cab back
and he was waitin' for a bus.

349
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,911
What bus?

350
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,013
I don't know.

351
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,982
It was over to, um,

352
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,184
Rollingwood somewheres.

353
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:26,625
Will you just forget it?!

354
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,026

00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,425
That's nice,
but not easy

531
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,828
to actually
get paid for that.

532
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:31,329
A neighbor friend of mine
gave me a lead

533
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:34,499
on a dishwashing job.
Oh, good.

534
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:35,867
Let me know if that
doesn't work out.

535
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,936
We have an arrangement
with some employers in town.

536
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:39,504
I can put you
on the waiting list.

537
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,306
Pays minimum wage.

538
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,941
Thank you, ma'am.

539
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:44,409
Okay, this is the fun part.

540
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,845
Sign here for your work money.

541
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:49,414
Where?
Right here.

542
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:51,316
This booklet shows you how
to budget your shopping,

543
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,285
cook nutritious meals,
balance your checkbook,

544
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:56,688
conduct a successful
job search,
that sort of thing.

545
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,990
A lot of the girls
find it very helpful.

546
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,292
I'm sure they do, ma'am.

547
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:04,362
$782.23.

548
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:08,233
You heard the saying
easy come, easy go?

549
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:09,901
Oh, this wasn't
easy come, ma'am.

550
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,836
I worked eight, long years
for this money.

551
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:16,674
(smooth jazz playing
over speakers)

552
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,455
(woman chuckles)

553
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:05,690
(children chattering)

554
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,759
Arlene, is that you
under there?

555
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:10,595
Oh, Ruby, could you help me
with this thing?

556
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,797
Okay, okay.
I got it.
That's it.

557
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,332
Okay. Whoa.

558
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,938
(both chuckling)
Oh, man.

559
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:22,707
Ooh!
Oh, my God.

560
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:25,743
Phew! Ten bucks at
a Salvation Army

561
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,945
and now I don't
have to sleep on

562
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:29,380
Candy's mattress no more.

563
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,715
Eww!

564
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,318
You know what? I got me
my own checking account.

565
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:37,055
I'ma have special ones made
with my name on it

566
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:38,656
and a beautiful sunset
and everything.

567
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:39,958
And I got one
of them cards,

568
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:42,527
you just stick it in
and money comes out.

569
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:43,928
Sometimes.

570
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,364
(both laughing)

571
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,866
So l-- Let's get rid
of this thing.

572
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:51,469
Oh, great.
(grunts)

573
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:54,706
Oh, Lord,
I just remembered.

574
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:55,907
My parole agent told me
I ain't supposed

575
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:57,542
to associate
with no ex-felons.

576
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:59,811
Cool with me.

577
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:05,850
(laughing)

578
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,585
Come on, Ruby.

579
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,621
Since when do we
ever listen?
Mm-hmm.

580
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,523
Hey, I set up
that job interview

581
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:12,857
about that dishwashing job.

582
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:15,426
Oh, thanks!

583
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:19,030
(knocking on door)

584
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,665
(man)
Open up, Candy!

585
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,901
Candy don't live here
no more, she moved!

586
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:24,569
Goodbye and good night.

587
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:26,437
(man)
Arlie girl,
is that you in there?

588
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:33,111
Open up.
Let me in, girl.
(pounding on door)

589
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:35,580
Who is that?
Who do you think it is?

590
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,315
Come on, let me in.
(pounding continues)

591
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,553
Just a minute,
I ain't decent.

592
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:43,621
I know, girl,
that's what I like about you.

593
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:46,591
Come on,
I seen it all before.
(knocking)

594
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:48,059
Quiet!
Oh, come on!

595
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,727
I'm coming!
(man laughing, knocking)

596
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:58,636
Hi, baby.

597
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,040
Hey, Carl.

598
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:09,447
What're you, mad at me,
Arlie girl?

599
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,416
People call me Arlene now.

600
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,720
How'd you find out
where I was?

601
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,524
Damn, your hair's different.

602
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:22,527
It's kinda, I don't know,
something.

603
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:28,032
It's hard to tell what's
going on with the rest of you...

604
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,667
Arlie.
Arlene.

605
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,536
(laughing)

606
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:34,072
Would you watch
where you lean?

607
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:36,374
I just got done
scrubbing that trim.

608
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:40,745
Don't be flickin' no ashes
on the floor neither.

609
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,525
They been messing with
your head, ain't they?

610
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,634
Who's the kid?

611
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:09,507
That's my sister
June's boy Joey.

612
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,047
I like to knit.

613
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:22,220
See, Johns, they don't, uh,
they don't like

614
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,623
looking at pictures
of family and bibles.

615
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,492
Jesus.

616
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:28,760
Kind of makes them
uncomfortable, you know?

617
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,864
They just might lose
their, uh, enthusiasm.

618
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:35,066
There ain't gonna
be no Johns.

619
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,836
And I ain't supposed
to be hangin' around

620
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:40,872
with no ex-cons.

621
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:45,777
So you just
better go, Carl.

622
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:46,978
Leave me alone.

623
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:48,179
This your new boyfriend?

624
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,849
Chaplain give me that.

625
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,851
Ooh.

626
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,791
Jesus love you, Arlene?

627
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,193
Yeah. He does.

628
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:03,928
Not the way I can.

629
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:05,863
Oh...

630
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:12,203
I-I'm getting me
a respectable job.

631
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:14,906
Doing what?
Something that pays good.

632
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:17,809
Arlie, you know three things.
Hookin', runnin', and shootin'.

633
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:20,611
Now, two of 'em pays good,
neither one of 'em respectable.

634
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:26,951
I got me a real job
right now if I want it.

635
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:30,088
All's I gotta do
is say so.

636
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:31,489
Doing what?

637
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,796
Huh?

638
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:41,566
Dishwashing.
Dishwashing? My!

639
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:46,604
What kinda big bucks
you gonna make dishwashing, huh?

640
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,039
I don't know,
they ain't told me yet.

641
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:49,874
I gotta find out when I go
for my interview.

642
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:52,710
You'll make 150 a week.

643
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:57,682
150, standing over a sink
of greasy, gray water,

644
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:00,084
pluckin' out blobs
of bread and lettuce.

645
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:03,354
People puttin' pieces
of chewed up meat
in the napkins,

646
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,890
and you gonna pick it out
eight hours a day,
six days a week,

647
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:09,093
150 lousy pictures
of Big Daddy George.

648
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:12,296
Now, how long it
gonna take you

649
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:14,632
to make 150 workin'
for me, huh?

650
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,871
A night.

651
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:23,775
Less than a night.
Two... hours--

652
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:25,042
You ain't stayin'.

653
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,744
(buttons popping)

654
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,746
You keep
your clothes on, Carl.

655
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:32,683
Two hours, baby.
Two hours.

656
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,786
You sleep all morning,

657
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:36,721
you spend the rest
of the day shoppin',

658
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,857
tryin' on... perfume.

659
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,294
You stay here,
you work eight hours a day,

660
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:47,331
your hands get all wrinkled,
your feet swell up like...

661
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:48,966
blood sausage.

662
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:52,136
I'm tellin' you,
Carl, to go.

663
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,571
I'm tellin' you git.

664
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:01,045
I don't wanna
go back to prison.

665
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:02,246
(laughing)
Prison?

666
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,681
I ain't talkin' about prison.

667
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:06,217
It ain't prison
I'm thinkin' about, honey.

668
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,657
That gun, Carl.

669
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:17,428
It-- It went off.

670
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:21,299
I know, Arlie.
I know.

671
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:23,901
See, that's what guns do.

672
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:28,105
They just,
uh... go off.

673
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,609
Bam... Bam...

674
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:36,013
Ow!
There she is!

675
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:38,716
There she is.
Hello, Arlie girl.

Who the hell you
kidding, kiddo?

677
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:45,456
You out now.
Arlie, you don't have

678
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:49,093
to fool nobody.

679
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:51,729
I said for you to go.

680
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,339
You need clothes.

681
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:04,342
I don't want nothin'
of yours.

682
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:05,977
You're gonna come
lookin' for me.

683
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,445
You know that, don't you?

684
00:44:07,445 --> 00:44:09,046
Arlene.

685
00:44:11,716 --> 00:44:12,917
You tell the bartender
who you are.

686
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:16,921
Who you really are.
(whimpering)

687
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:19,257
And you just wait till
I get there, okay?

Hi, Arlene.

Mr. Collins should be here
in a little while.

701
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,502
Um, Ruby, I was wondering,

702
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,871
how much that
dishwashing job pay?

703
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,806

00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:25,149
scraping chewed-up food
off people's plates?

706
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:29,053
Yeah, that's right.

707
00:46:29,053 --> 00:46:30,388
Go on, take a look around.

708
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,360
(plates clattering)

709
00:46:57,882 --> 00:46:59,316
Without any office skills

710
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:04,255
and, um, given your recent
experience in...

711
00:47:04,255 --> 00:47:08,159
Prison.
Yes.

712
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,593
I think your best bet
for a job

713
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:11,195
is with your parole agent.

714
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,330
Oh.

715
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,934
Thanks for coming by,
sorry we can't help.

716
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:20,137
No, okay, thank you.

717
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:21,339
(coin rattles)

718
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:22,940
(sighs)

719
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,241
(mutters)

720
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,389
"Earn $50,000 a year.

721
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:42,860
Chance of a lifetime,
call now."

722
00:47:48,499 --> 00:47:52,236
(man)
No, that's great,
Mary June.

723
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:53,671
Mm-hmm. (chuckles)

724
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:57,274
Well, 5,000 in one month
is your best yet, right?

725
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:59,143
Mm-hmm.

726
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:01,612
Right. (chuckling)

727
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:03,581
Okay.
And I'm proud of you.

728
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:05,382
I'll send the check
over today, okay?

729
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:08,085
Good.
No, it's no problem.

730
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:09,653
Bye.

731
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:12,223
Hi, I'm Brian Craig.

732
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,325
My name is Arlene Holsclaw--

733
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:16,127
And you'd like
to change your life,

734
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,328
right, Arlene?

735
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:21,732
Can you feel the healing
properties of Regal?

736
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:25,069
Mm-hmm.

737
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:26,403
Do you know what's
more important

738
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:29,240
to our company than
these special products?

739
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,442
Mmn-mm.

740
00:48:31,442 --> 00:48:32,910
You are.

741
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:38,282
I am?
Mm-hmm.

742
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:41,519
Now, open your eyes, Arlene.

743
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:43,587
I want you to see something.

744
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,994
Oh.

745
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:53,364
What did you do?

746
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:55,466
Regal did it.

747
00:48:55,466 --> 00:48:59,036
Regal uncovered
your beauty.

748
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:01,438
Now it's going to uncover
your intelligence.

749
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:11,115
Where you been, Arlene?

750
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,750
Mr. Collins, the boss,
waited 'round here

751
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,518
half an hour for you.

752
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:16,787
I went and got me
a respectable job

753
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,422
that pays good.

754
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:20,391
What you talkin'
'bout, Arlene?

755
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:23,260
How would you like to make
money while you're sleepin'?

756
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,629
And have soft hands too?

757
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:31,235
Bible says ask
and it will be given.

758
00:49:31,235 --> 00:49:33,204
Seek and you will find.

759
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:35,072
Knock and it will
be opened for you,

760
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:36,373
and that's what I done.

761
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:38,342
I asked the Good Lord
for a job that pays good

762
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:40,277
so I can get my Joey back.

763
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:44,815
And now, you are looking
at a future distributor

764
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,084
of Regal beauty products.

765
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:49,687
Hand lotion, shampoo,

766
00:49:49,687 --> 00:49:53,557
you feel the good
that's doing you?

767
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:58,329
The big money ain't
in your door-to-door.

768
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:01,665
See, I go out
and sign people up

769
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,300
just like Brian
done to me.

770
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,703
And they give me
the $500

771
00:50:05,703 --> 00:50:07,805
and I get 20%
of everything they sell.

772
00:50:07,805 --> 00:50:10,441
I'm sleepin',
I'm takin' a bath,

773
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:14,211
I got people workin' for me,
makin' me rich.

774
00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:20,618
You can see why I couldn't
take that dishwashing job.

775
00:50:20,618 --> 00:50:22,453
Did this Brian pop
you for 500?

776
00:50:22,453 --> 00:50:26,123
Uh-huh, and now I got me
my own busi--

777
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:27,625
It's a con, girl.

778
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,499
Ruby...

779
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:38,269
I been in his fancy office.

780
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:40,738
I seen his big car,

781
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:43,674
and his parking place
with his name on it.

782
00:50:43,674 --> 00:50:47,711
And his own
commission check, $20,000.

783
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,147
You go back down
to his fancy office,

784
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:52,316
he won't be there,
I guarantee it.

785
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:59,423
Why do you say that?

786
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:01,692
Trust me, girl,
I been there.

787
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:04,395
Now, I know a con
when I smell one.

788
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:08,866
Oh, man.

789
00:51:08,866 --> 00:51:11,535
Oh, man...

790
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:14,305

00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:15,806
Um...

792
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:20,511
Oh, Ruby.

793
00:51:22,613 --> 00:51:26,216
That is all the money
I had in the world.

794
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:30,220
What am I gonna do?

795
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,556
Well, you gotta
do something.

796
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:35,359
Can't nobody do it for you,

797
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,628

is long gone.

Is this an

Everything's original, ma'am.
That's the fun part.

I been feelin' good
ever since.

824
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:50,954
Anyway, she looked
at every one twice

825
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,556
and then asked me
about my Fair Isle,

826
00:54:52,556 --> 00:54:54,491
about my Aran,
about my intarsia.

827
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:58,462
And then she said
she'd love some

828
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:00,864
and she wants to put
my sweaters in her windows

829

I always paid Candy 50.

838
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:36,833
You here for
the knitting class?

839
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,835
Knitting class?
Ruby, we got a man
who wants to be

840
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,771
in the knitting
and Bible study class.

841
00:55:40,771 --> 00:55:42,940
Praise the Lord!
Tell him to come
on in here!

842
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,409
He bring his Bible and his
knitting needles with him?

843
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:47,010
Did you?

844
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,012
You see Candy,

845
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:53,483
you tell her I stopped by
to say hello, hear?

846
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:56,086
You have
a nice evening.
You too.

847
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:02,993
(both laughing)

848
00:56:02,993 --> 00:56:04,761
Go on, go on,
finish telling me.

849
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:08,465
So she says she wants me
to teach a class

850
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,701
to women who wanna
learn how to knit.

851
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:14,071
And when I ain't teaching,
I'm working in her store

852
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:16,873
and I'm earning
$6.30 an hour.

853
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,444
Now, that ain't bad.

854
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:25,716
Ow!

855
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,784
Pot roast.

856
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:29,820
I made potatoes
with no skins.

857
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,021
My, my, my.

858
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:33,490
Now, all this
just for me and you?

859
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,125
Well, I-I gotta
practice cookin'

860
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:38,795
so I can cook decent
when my boy gets home.

861
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:40,897

862
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,834
I might get him
a bicycle too.

863
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:45,902
I always wanted
to have a bicycle.

864
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,105
Except for my mama...

865
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:52,709
Anyway, I'm gonna go
to county people tomorrow.

866
00:56:56,213 --> 00:56:57,614
Let me try.

867
00:56:58,849 --> 00:57:00,050

Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

877
00:57:52,703 --> 00:57:55,639
Well, what can
we do for you?

878
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:58,975
I've come to see about
getting Joey back.

879
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:04,815
Um, Miss Holsclaw,
we do have your file but...

880
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:07,217
I got a good job now
and a place to live,

881
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:09,319
and I'm fixing
it up real nice.

882
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:12,289
I can make a good home
for him now.

883
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:14,157
Didn't your mother write
to you about--

884
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,293
I know she put him out
to foster care,

885
00:58:16,293 --> 00:58:19,029
but I'm back now.

886
00:58:19,029 --> 00:58:22,065
Miss Holsclaw,

887
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:24,735
your mother didn't put
Joey in foster care.

888
00:58:24,735 --> 00:58:26,937
Yes, she did.

889
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:28,839
She put him up
for adoption.

890
00:58:31,775 --> 00:58:33,577
How could she do that?

891
00:58:33,577 --> 00:58:37,147
She had that right.
She adopted Joey from you.

892
00:58:37,147 --> 00:58:39,583
Didn't you
agree to that?

893
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:40,851
No.

894
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:44,888
No, I-I...

895
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:49,292
I-I-I signed some papers,
but I thought that was

896
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:52,028
just to keep him
in the family.

897
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,698
I-I thought that was
just temporary.

898
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:57,067
There's nothing temporary
about adoption.

899
00:58:57,067 --> 00:59:00,937
And once your mother
became Joey's legal mother,

900
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:03,907
she could make the same decision
about adoption that you did.

901
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:06,209
Without asking me?
Yes.

902
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,211
Why didn't nobody tell me?

903
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,846
Once legal rights
are terminated,

904
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:12,949
we cease all contact
with the terminated parent.

905
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:15,051
My boy and I,
we ain't seen each other

906
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:17,988
in a long time.

907
00:59:17,988 --> 00:59:21,792
Now, I know it's gonna
take time to work this out.

908
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:24,194
But I been waiting
eight years.

909
00:59:24,194 --> 00:59:25,929
I can't wait no more.

910
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:28,665
I wanna see my Joey
this weekend.

911
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:32,369
I wanna start gettin' on
a regular schedule with him.

912
00:59:32,369 --> 00:59:34,104
I'm sorry.

913
00:59:34,104 --> 00:59:38,408
You are legally prohibited
from all contact with the child.

914
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:41,945
When the child comes of age--
You're telling me

915
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:43,780
that I can't
even see Joey?

916
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:46,283
No.
He is my son.

917
00:59:46,283 --> 00:59:49,920
How do I know they're
treating him right?

918
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,721
He's fortunate to
have been adopted

919
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:54,891
by a very fine couple
who love him very much.

920
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:56,793
Oh.
I placed him,
so I know.

921
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:58,929
Oh, well, I'd like
to see that for myself,

922
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:00,130
if you don't mind.

923
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:03,099
If you attempt contact
with the child,

924
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,602
you will be subject
to revocation of parole.

925
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:09,206
He's no longer your child.

and the gartering.

935
01:00:45,242 --> 01:00:50,046
But, uh... my feeling is

936
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:53,717
is stitches ain't
the most important thing.

937
01:00:53,717 --> 01:00:57,053

I started knitting

01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:14,137
Knitting is a kind of...

It's a kind of
healing thing for me.

It's-- It's a comfort.

944
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:23,880

empty out my mind,

945

when I was in school and I got
in that fight with them girls?

988

And you had
to come pick me up?

989

I was always picking
you up someplace.

police stations, jail.

01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:21,084

you done after?

into my head today.

Oh, my, yes.
I remember him.

Wasn't he a good looker?

997
01:05:38,635 --> 01:05:41,704
You went in that bar
and left me waiting in the cab.

998
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:44,574
Well, wasn't gonna take
a child of mine

999
01:05:44,574 --> 01:05:47,010
in a dump like that.
Well, you went.

1000
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:48,978
Whadn't no harm in it.

1001
01:05:51,648 --> 01:05:55,618
I was wondering why you
left me waiting in the cab

1002
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:58,488
instead of taking me
home first.

1003
01:06:08,064 --> 01:06:11,134

that men liked, you know.

What?

I was 12 years old, Mama.

What men are you
talking about?

1009
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,161
I wish I talked
to you, Mama.

1010
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,299
I wish I'd
told you things.

1011
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:46,703
What things?
Thank God I didn't know

1012
01:06:46,703 --> 01:06:49,539
most of what you done,
anymore would've killed me.

1013
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:56,279
You-- You didn't used to like
the way Daddy looked at me.

1014
01:06:56,279 --> 01:06:59,249
Hard as you tried
to get his attention?

1015
01:06:59,249 --> 01:07:03,186
Sashaying around
shameless like you did.

1016
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:04,420
That's why I told him
to go ahead

1017
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:06,089
and put you
in that school.

1018
01:07:08,658 --> 01:07:10,693
You what?

1019
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:16,132
You told them to put me
in reform school?

1020
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:18,601
Had to get you out
of my house, didn't I?

1021
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:22,772
Well, it's a good thing
they got reform schools
in prisons, huh, Mama?

1022
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:27,210
What did I ever do to get
such a hateful child?

1023
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:30,813

leave it anyway.

if you needed anything.

1040
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:22,932
Forgot to pay
your light bill?

1041
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:25,601
I like it better
in the dark.

1042
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,305
Why don't you come over
and watch some TV with me?

1043
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:31,174
Get out of this place
for a while?

1044
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:36,546

there's only three schools
in Rollingwood.

1046
01:08:39,549 --> 01:08:42,218
And my boy's
at one of 'em.

1047
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:45,154
Arlene, you ain't thinkin' about
doing something stupid, are you?

1048
01:08:46,723 --> 01:08:48,191
Look, you don't know nothin'
about them people

1049
01:08:48,191 --> 01:08:49,959
that's adopted your boy.

1050
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:53,463
They might be m--
Well, you don't know
nothing about 'em.

1051
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:55,965
That's right,
I don't know nothing.

1052
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,334
I don't know where he is,

1053
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:00,603
I don't know how
they're treating him.

1054
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:02,405
He could be alone
right now.

1055
01:09:02,405 --> 01:09:05,575
And he could be
