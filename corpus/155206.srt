1
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:26,528
(door opens)

2
00:00:36,253 --> 00:00:39,325
- Whenever you're ready.
- I don't recommend it.

3
00:00:39,413 --> 00:00:43,645
It's too soon to use psychoactives on him
again. His system hasn't had time to recover.

4
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:46,691
Your concerns are noted. Now let's proceed.

5
00:00:46,773 --> 00:00:50,083
Just give me a day or two
to stabilise his condition.

6
00:00:50,173 --> 00:00:53,290
Maybe you don't understand what's at stake.

7
00:00:53,373 --> 00:00:55,762
He knows where the X5s are.

8
00:00:55,853 --> 00:00:59,448
He's got it locked in his brain,
but I'm gonna get it out.

9
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:03,208
- You're not gonna get anything if he's dead.
- I'll take that risk.

10
00:01:08,613 --> 00:01:10,763
Do it.

11
00:01:11,373 --> 00:01:13,967
Do it, or I'll find someone else who will.

12
00:02:12,373 --> 00:02:14,887
Where are they, Zack?

13
00:02:14,973 --> 00:02:17,009
Where's Jondy?

14
00:02:17,653 --> 00:02:19,883
Where's Max?

15
00:02:22,093 --> 00:02:24,163
Tell me, and all this will be over.

16
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:20,646
Zack.

17
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:24,164
Max! How... how did you...?

18
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:27,730
Sh. I'll explain later.
We gotta get outta here.

19
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:35,090
- Max, you shouldn't have come here.
- After what you did for me, I had to.

20
00:03:35,613 --> 00:03:37,888
Can you make it over the perimeter fence?

21
00:03:37,973 --> 00:03:40,282
If I can't, you go on without me.

22
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:57,684
The guards will be changing shifts soon.
We'll make a break for it then.

23
00:03:59,253 --> 00:04:02,689
Did you tell them anything?
About me or... the others?

24
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:05,648
- If they've been compromised...
- I didn't.

25
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:09,203
- Tell me where they are so I can warn them.
- I didn't say anything.

26
00:04:09,453 --> 00:04:11,603
You sure?

27
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:17,845
- What's the matter, Zack?
- I don't know. You tell me.

28
00:04:22,573 --> 00:04:24,325
- You're not Max.
- Zack!

29
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:26,404
- Who are you?
- Zack!

30
00:04:28,013 --> 00:04:30,004
No...

31
00:04:36,213 --> 00:04:38,283
Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

32
00:04:44,093 --> 00:04:46,482
I'm tellin' you, he can't take this.

33
00:04:47,293 --> 00:04:53,084
I'll... never... tell... you... anything.

34
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:48,727
- Hey.
- (Bling) Hey.

35
00:05:48,813 --> 00:05:51,407
- Check it out.
- Haven't seen one of those in a while.

36
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:57,450
Scored it at the market. Thought Logan
might whip up one of his culinary miracles.

37
00:05:57,533 --> 00:06:00,001
He around?

38
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,084
He went for a walk.

39
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:05,770
- A walk?
- Down by the waterfront.

40
00:06:17,013 --> 00:06:20,483
Hey. No trespassing. Can't you read?

41
00:06:21,373 --> 00:06:23,728
Take off your shoes and come here.

42
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:32,806
I left you a little present back at your place.

43
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,771
- A fresh chicken.
- Oh, wow.

44
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:39,926
I see a poulet chez Cale in your future,
with a bottle of pre-Pulse Nuit-St-Georges.

45
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:42,243
Say around... eight o'clock?

46
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,048
I was hoping you'd say that.

47
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:47,283
It's beautiful, isn't it?

48
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,962
And it's funny.
For the first time in a long time,

49
00:06:53,053 --> 00:06:56,966
I feel like anything
and everything is possible.

50
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:07,373
Aren't you cold?

51
00:07:07,453 --> 00:07:09,648
Freezing.

52
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:12,372
But it feels great.

53
00:07:19,693 --> 00:07:21,763
This is a restricted area.

54
00:07:21,853 --> 00:07:24,367
Repeat: This is a restricted area.

55
00:07:25,253 --> 00:07:27,403
I hate those things.

56
00:07:27,493 --> 00:07:30,326
Yeah. We'd better go.

57
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,722
I guess so.

58
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:41,688
See you tonight?

59
00:07:41,773 --> 00:07:43,764
- Eight o'clock.
- Sharp.

60
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:46,490
- I should get to work.
- I gotta head home.

61
00:07:46,573 --> 00:07:48,564
- Bye.
- Bye.

62
00:07:59,373 --> 00:08:00,965
(both) Wrong way.

63
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:06,123
How many times have I told you? You don't
have a signature, you don't get paid.

64
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,405
- 225 Carrington.
- Signature.

65
00:08:09,493 --> 00:08:12,690
- Right there.
- Robert Marley. That's more like it.

66
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:18,003
- Doesn't seem fair.
- It's not fair.

67
00:08:18,093 --> 00:08:22,928
But what could Original Cindy do? They
turned off my electricity, heat, even my water.

68
00:08:23,013 --> 00:08:24,810
Uh, you're late.

69
00:08:24,893 --> 00:08:27,248
Back off, or I'll put a smackdown on your ass.

70
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:31,531
Hey, cut her a little slack, man.
She just got evicted from her apartment.

71
00:08:31,613 --> 00:08:34,923
I'm really sorry, girl.
I can't help feelin' responsible.

72
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:38,801
Not your fault you've got some hopped-up
killin' machines gunnin' for you.

73
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,361
I can't believe they killed your super.

74
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:47,369
Me neither. Not that he didn't deserve it.
I mean, he was a slum lord and a weasel.

75
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:52,690
I can't blame the folks for wantin' me outta
the building for bringin' in a bad element.

76
00:08:52,773 --> 00:08:57,005
First you lose yourjob
because of me, and then your crib.

77
00:08:57,093 --> 00:08:59,084
Gig was a bust, crib was a dump.

78
00:08:59,813 --> 00:09:03,601
Original Cindy just gotta
stay strong with the struggle.

79
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:07,481
- Why don't you crash at my place?
- Thanks, but I don't wanna impose.

80
00:09:07,573 --> 00:09:10,963
You're not. Kendra moved
into her cop boyfriend's love nest,

81
00:09:11,053 --> 00:09:13,408
so there's plenty of room.

82
00:09:13,493 --> 00:09:15,882
- You sure?
- We'll move you in at lunch.

83
00:09:16,893 --> 00:09:20,442
Just one question.
Those superfreaks still lookin' for you?

84
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:22,763
After the way I kicked their butt?

85
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,003
What about those black helicopter boys?

86
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,848
That whole situation's
pretty much chilled out.

87
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:31,083
- A'ight. I'm in.
- Cool.

88
00:09:31,173 --> 00:09:33,164
At lunch.

89
00:10:03,093 --> 00:10:06,085
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

90
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:10,362
- Why?
- Tearin' through like you lost somethin'.

91
00:10:10,453 --> 00:10:15,322
- Just tryin' to find somethin' to wear.
- Where you goin', anyway?

92
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:18,166
- Over to Logan's.
- Oh. So you got a date?

93
00:10:18,253 --> 00:10:21,404
It's not a date.
She's just comin' over for dinner.

94
00:10:21,493 --> 00:10:23,609
Uh-huh.

95
00:10:23,693 --> 00:10:27,527
- We have dinner all the time.
- Yeah, but things are different now.

96
00:10:27,613 --> 00:10:31,208
The... gun is loaded. If you know what I mean.

97
00:10:31,293 --> 00:10:33,682
No, I don't know what you mean.

98
00:10:33,773 --> 00:10:38,051
I've seen the way you two look at each other.
With him up and around,

99
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:41,887
- Maybe you two can do somethin' about it.
- We're not like that. Besides...

100
00:10:41,973 --> 00:10:46,285
Just because I was in a wheelchair, doesn't
mean I couldn't have gone there if I wanted.

101
00:10:46,373 --> 00:10:47,362
I understand.

102
00:10:47,453 --> 00:10:51,082
But it doesn't matter if the obstacle
between you and him gettin' busy

103
00:10:51,173 --> 00:10:54,483
was physical or psychological, it's gone now.

104
00:10:54,573 --> 00:10:56,564
And your point is?

105
00:10:57,413 --> 00:10:59,608
That it's a whole new ball game.

106
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:02,491
Which is why you're a nervous wreck.

107
00:11:02,573 --> 00:11:04,564
I'm not nervous. Ow!

108
00:11:04,653 --> 00:11:06,644
Yeah, right.

109
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:10,248
This is just one more reason
I'm glad I'm a lesbian.

110
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,893
We don't put ourselves
through all this drama.

111
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:16,170
After the second date, we move in together.

112
00:11:16,253 --> 00:11:18,687
We're just friends gettin' together for dinner.

113
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:24,769
Anything more than that is a sure-fire way...
to ruin a nice friendship.

114
00:11:26,293 --> 00:11:29,763
Whatever you say.
But I'm clearin' out of here just the same.

115
00:11:29,853 --> 00:11:34,051
If you're not comin' home,
could you just call, so I don't worry?

116
00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:01,290
Are you all right?

117
00:13:01,373 --> 00:13:03,443
I'm sorry.

118
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,524
It was the only way to get you out.

119
00:13:06,773 --> 00:13:10,083
Here. Put these on.

120
00:13:11,493 --> 00:13:15,566
- Why are you helping me?
- So maybe I can live with myself.

121
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:35,329
I'll get you to the state line.
Then you're on your own.

122
00:13:38,813 --> 00:13:40,849
Just take it.

123
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:51,409
(helicopter flies over)

124
00:13:52,453 --> 00:13:54,250
(machine-gun fire)

125
00:13:58,813 --> 00:14:01,247
Run! Run!

126
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,884
Get out!

127
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,604
Halt! Halt!

128
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:12,724
Go! Go!

129
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:20,282
All teams, he's on foot,
headed southeast from rally point seven.

130
00:14:28,093 --> 00:14:30,084
(doorbell)

131
00:14:44,853 --> 00:14:46,764
- Hey.
- Hey.

132
00:14:49,373 --> 00:14:51,364
Come on in.

133
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:09,244
(phone rings)

134
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,010
- Yeah?
- Max?

135
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:18,212
Who is this?

136
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,244
(both) So...

137
00:15:33,893 --> 00:15:35,884
(both) So...

138
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,844
- (buzzer)
- Dinner.

139
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,208
Oh, no!

140
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,684
Chicken tartare?

141
00:16:05,893 --> 00:16:08,282
Oh, that's... That's so wrong.

142
00:16:08,373 --> 00:16:10,648
(phone rings)

143
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:12,724
- Can... can you get that?
- Yeah.

144
00:16:12,813 --> 00:16:14,849
- Turn the oven on.
- OK.

145
00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:20,171
- Hello.
- Max!

146
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,888
Zack?

147
00:16:23,213 --> 00:16:25,204
I need you.

148
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:33,125
He's hiding near Manticore.
I have to get to him before they do.

149
00:16:33,213 --> 00:16:35,852
No. Those woods will be
crawling with Lydecker's men.

150
00:16:35,933 --> 00:16:38,572
I'm going, Logan. I owe it to him.

151
00:16:38,653 --> 00:16:40,530
OK.

152
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:44,083
Say you make it past the sector checkpoint.
Say you even get to him.

153
00:16:44,173 --> 00:16:46,892
You think you can slip out
through a Manticore dragnet?

154
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:50,124
We did it once, and we were just kids then.

155
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:52,681
What if it's a trap?
What if Zack's been turned?

156
00:16:52,773 --> 00:16:55,810
Zack, turned?
You don't know him at all, do you?

157
00:16:56,413 --> 00:17:00,167
- I am not letting you do this.
- Nobody's gladder than me you're walking.

158
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:03,689
But-reality check - I could still kick your ass.

159
00:17:48,853 --> 00:17:52,732
Contraband check. Shut her down.
We gotta search the whole rig.

160
00:18:57,373 --> 00:18:59,091
Zack!

161
00:19:01,013 --> 00:19:03,083
Zack?

162
00:19:03,173 --> 00:19:06,165
- Zack! It's me.
- What are you doin' here?

163
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:08,448
- You're hurting me!
- He sent you.

164
00:19:08,693 --> 00:19:13,084
- What are you talking about? You called me.
- You're trying to trick me.

165
00:19:13,973 --> 00:19:15,964
I'm not trying to trick you.

166
00:19:16,933 --> 00:19:19,686
Lydecker's men are all over.
We gotta get outta here.

167
00:19:19,773 --> 00:19:22,207
He sent you to bring me back,
but it won't work.

168
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:24,648
You were turned.
You're a threat to the others.

169
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:26,485
Zack!

170
00:19:29,693 --> 00:19:32,844
- Don't move.
- I knew it. I knew you were one of them.

171
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:38,451
If that were true, this'd be the part where I call
in a TAC team and turn you over to Lydecker.

172
00:19:39,293 --> 00:19:42,808
But it's not true.
I'm here because you asked me to come.

173
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,528
Max.

174
00:19:53,613 --> 00:19:56,685
Shhh. It's OK.

175
00:19:57,133 --> 00:19:59,522
Everything's gonna be all right.

176
00:19:59,853 --> 00:20:04,165
We'll stay here till it gets dark,
then I'm gonna get you outta here.

177
00:20:06,693 --> 00:20:09,287
What did they do to you?

178
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:12,843
I didn't tell them anything, Max,
about you or any of the others.

179
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:17,051
If they used psychoactives on you,
you can't be sure of anything.

180
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:21,331
I couldn't have said anything, Max,
because I don't know anything.

181
00:20:22,493 --> 00:20:25,769
I made myself forget,
the way that they taught us to.

182
00:20:25,853 --> 00:20:29,084
No one can resist torture indefinitely.
Not even you.

183
00:20:29,573 --> 00:20:32,485
The mind is infinitely pliable.
You will tell what you know.

184
00:20:32,573 --> 00:20:36,486
- 54974235694...
- Memories can be buried. Obfuscated.

185
00:20:36,573 --> 00:20:40,168
- 73711...
- You can learn to forget what you know.

186
00:20:40,253 --> 00:20:43,689
- Your own name. Your bar code number.
- 54974235694...

187
00:20:43,773 --> 00:20:48,164
By deliberately filling
your mind with disinformation,

188
00:20:48,253 --> 00:20:52,883
you can so confuse your memory
that you can't reveal the truth.

189
00:20:52,973 --> 00:20:57,091
Is this your bar code? Answer me!

190
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,607
I made myself forget...

191
00:21:00,813 --> 00:21:03,168
to protect you.

192
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:05,562
To protect all of you.

193
00:21:05,653 --> 00:21:09,726
- It's OK. It's over.
- No. No, it's not.

194
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:13,247
I'm the only one who knew.

195
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:17,724
The only one. I've gotta remember
so that I can protect them.

196
00:21:17,813 --> 00:21:20,885
You will. You called me, right?
You remembered my number?

197
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,530
- It's not the same.
- Yes. You can do it if you try.

198
00:21:24,773 --> 00:21:27,890
No, it's different with you!

199
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,244
I mean, how could I forget...

200
00:21:40,853 --> 00:21:43,811
a single thing about you?

201
00:21:46,653 --> 00:21:48,769
How could I?

202
00:21:48,853 --> 00:21:50,844
(helicopter flies overhead)

203
00:21:52,973 --> 00:21:55,692
Better check it out,
make sure we're OK in here.

204
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,764
You stay put.

205
00:22:28,493 --> 00:22:30,484
It's me.

206
00:22:35,613 --> 00:22:41,245
It's been a long time since I've been able
to let my guard down long enough to sleep.

207
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:45,121
Probably wouldn't bother you.
You never slept much anyway.

208
00:22:45,373 --> 00:22:50,766
Me and Jondy. We must have shark DNA
in us or something. Just don't need to sleep.

209
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:53,647
It's why she doesn't mind working nights.

210
00:22:57,333 --> 00:23:00,211
In a bar. In Portland.

211
00:23:01,053 --> 00:23:04,090
No, wait. That's Tinga.
Jondy lives in San Francisco.

212
00:23:04,173 --> 00:23:07,165
- Go on.
- She lives right near the Golden Gate.

213
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:10,609
What about Tinga?
You said she lives in Portland.

214
00:23:10,693 --> 00:23:14,322
Works at... a bakery.
You should see how long her hair's gotten.

215
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:18,642
- It's like she hasn't cut it since the escape.
- Zane? Where does he live?

216
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:21,452
In LA. He's a mechanic.

217
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,093
He's got a dog. A German shepherd.

218
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:29,085
Scary-looking. Like we had
back in Manticore. But sweet.

219
00:23:29,173 --> 00:23:31,243
Keep going. You're doing great.

220
00:23:31,613 --> 00:23:35,288
The subscriber you're trying
to page is out of service range.

221
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:37,807
- Still can't get ahold of her, huh?
- No.

222
00:23:38,813 --> 00:23:41,168
I'm heading to the market.
You need anything?

223
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,244
No thanks.

224
00:24:14,213 --> 00:24:16,568
Tell me about Krit. What's he up to?

225
00:24:16,653 --> 00:24:19,213
Krit?

226
00:24:23,573 --> 00:24:24,642
- I don't know.
- It's OK.

227
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:27,850
- I... I can't remember.
- It's all right. It'll come back.

228
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,801
I saw Brin back at Manticore.

229
00:24:33,133 --> 00:24:36,842
We're gonna get her
out of there someday, you and me.

230
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:41,085
You should get some rest.
It won't be dark for a while yet.

231
00:24:44,373 --> 00:24:47,683
Thanks, Maxie. For comin' to get me, I mean.

232
00:24:47,773 --> 00:24:50,731
It's the least I can do
after what you've done for me.

233
00:24:50,813 --> 00:24:53,930
Lydecker tried to trick me
into thinkin' you came for me before.

234
00:24:54,013 --> 00:24:56,846
What do you mean? Trick you how?

235
00:24:57,333 --> 00:25:02,282
Shot me up with God knows what. Sent
someone in pretending to be like you.

236
00:25:02,373 --> 00:25:04,364
Really messed with my head.

237
00:25:05,573 --> 00:25:09,168
- So tired.
- It's OK. Sleep.

238
00:25:16,213 --> 00:25:20,047
I'm gonna head up the road.
There's a gas station nearby.

239
00:25:20,973 --> 00:25:22,964
I'll get us some food.

240
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:26,247
If I don't come back by sundown, keep going.

241
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:28,684
Find the others.

242
00:25:48,933 --> 00:25:52,369
(man) We're in position and standing by.
Still no sign of her.

243
00:26:14,213 --> 00:26:16,283
- Has she shown yet?
- Negative.

244
00:26:19,213 --> 00:26:21,727
What do you think he'll do
when she doesn't show up?

245
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:25,010
He'll do as he should do.
Assume she's been captured,

246
00:26:25,093 --> 00:26:27,653
- Move along and try to find the others.
- (static)

247
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:30,406
- What's wrong with the audio?
- Shouldn't break up.

248
00:26:30,493 --> 00:26:32,802
I'm still gettin' a strong GPS signal.

249
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:35,851
- He's movin'.
- (Lydecker) Any sign of her yet?

250
00:26:35,933 --> 00:26:41,007
- (radio) Negative.
- This is takin' too long. Something's wrong.

251
00:26:41,093 --> 00:26:44,608
All units, this is Command.
We're bringin' them in.

252
00:26:45,093 --> 00:26:48,244
He's movin'south, along the stream.

253
00:27:04,853 --> 00:27:06,923
He's stopped.

254
00:27:07,013 --> 00:27:11,928
Delta, this is Control. Target is
south of your position, 175 degrees.

255
00:27:12,013 --> 00:27:14,083
Roger, Control. We're movin' in.

256
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:20,524
Control, this is Delta team.
We're in the target area. No sign of them.

257
00:27:20,613 --> 00:27:22,763
- Over.
- That's impossible.

258
00:27:23,693 --> 00:27:25,490
He's right where you are.

259
00:27:25,773 --> 00:27:27,286
Sir?

260
00:27:37,053 --> 00:27:39,726
- The transmitter.
- Say again.

261
00:27:39,973 --> 00:27:43,090
He's ripped it out of his head.
Used it as a decoy.

262
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:49,764
Max. They were listening
to us the whole time...

263
00:27:49,853 --> 00:27:52,048
They heard about where the others are.

264
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:55,762
- We've gotta warn them.
- We've gotta get outta here first.

265
00:28:03,573 --> 00:28:05,564
It was a trick.

266
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:10,843
Lydecker let him escape
so he'd lead him to the others.

267
00:28:12,133 --> 00:28:14,852
I compromised the others.
I jeopardised everything!

268
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:16,924
What do you mean? How?

269
00:28:18,293 --> 00:28:20,602
By opening...

270
00:28:22,813 --> 00:28:25,202
my big mouth.

271
00:28:26,053 --> 00:28:27,930
It's a long story.

272
00:28:28,413 --> 00:28:32,770
(Zack) Works at... a bakery.
You should see how long her hair's gotten.

273
00:28:32,853 --> 00:28:35,606
It's like she hasn't cut it since the escape.

274
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,164
He's gonna try to warn 'em.

275
00:28:40,933 --> 00:28:43,322
Let them know they've been compromised.

276
00:28:43,413 --> 00:28:47,122
We're gonna have to move on this,
and we're gonna have to move fast.

277
00:28:49,573 --> 00:28:53,168
You said Tinga worked
at a bakery in Portland. Which one?

278
00:28:55,973 --> 00:28:59,522
- I don't know.
- What about Zane? Where did he work?

279
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:04,731
- How did you stay in touch with them, Zack?
- Contact number.

280
00:29:04,813 --> 00:29:07,611
I set up a voicemail box
so they could check in with me.

281
00:29:07,693 --> 00:29:11,083
- And if you needed to reach one of them?
- I'd call.

282
00:29:11,173 --> 00:29:14,006
Jondy. Did you call her?

283
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:18,686
- What was her number?
- I don't know.

284
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:21,412
Think, Zack. Her life depends on it.

285
00:29:25,093 --> 00:29:27,561
Don't you think I know that by now?!

286
00:29:37,493 --> 00:29:39,290
- Give him time.
- We don't have time.

287
00:29:39,373 --> 00:29:41,887
It could already be too late to save them.

288
00:29:50,813 --> 00:29:52,883
Sorry. It's not your fault.

289
00:29:52,973 --> 00:29:54,964
It's just...

290
00:29:55,733 --> 00:29:59,931
- There has to be a way to warn them.
- Maybe there is.

291
00:30:00,013 --> 00:30:02,004
(sirens on television)

292
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:06,203
- What's up?
- What happened to your knee?

293
00:30:06,293 --> 00:30:09,251
- I fell chasin' the guy.
- Yeah, right, you sissy freak.

294
00:30:11,773 --> 00:30:14,731
Arrest him already. He's a reprobate.

295
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,044
Don't you turn your back
on a police officer, you weenie.

296
00:30:18,613 --> 00:30:20,968
- Do not attempt to adjust your sets.
- Agh!

297
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:23,772
This is a Streaming Freedom video bulletin.

298
00:30:23,853 --> 00:30:27,243
This cable hack is being
beamed to you right across America.

299
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:30,006
It cannot be traced. It cannot be stopped.

300
00:30:30,733 --> 00:30:33,645
This is a message for those known as X5.

301
00:30:34,013 --> 00:30:36,732
You have been compromised.
You are in danger.

302
00:30:36,973 --> 00:30:38,770
Hand me that three-sixteenth.

303
00:30:38,853 --> 00:30:42,243
- Your locations have been compromised.
- Zane?

304
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:44,244
- You know what to do.
- Zane?

305
00:30:44,613 --> 00:30:49,448
This message will repeat every hour on
the hour until each of you has checked in.

306
00:30:50,493 --> 00:30:52,882
Now we wait to see
who calls the contact number.

307
00:30:53,173 --> 00:30:57,246
- Eyes Only just made another enemy.
- It was gettin' a little quiet around here.

308
00:30:57,853 --> 00:31:01,289
This Eyes Only is a pain in the ass
do-gooder. But smart.

309
00:31:02,373 --> 00:31:07,322
But the question is,
why is he trying to help my kids?

310
00:31:07,413 --> 00:31:10,485
I don't know. It's not
the sort of thing he usually gets into.

311
00:31:10,573 --> 00:31:14,805
When all this is over,
I want you to find out who this clown is.

312
00:31:16,893 --> 00:31:20,363
Zane, Syl and Krit have all called in.
They're already on the move.

313
00:31:20,453 --> 00:31:23,126
Thatjust leaves Tinga and Jondy.

314
00:31:26,173 --> 00:31:28,562
You sure I didn't blab about the others?

315
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,167
Believe me, I'd remember.

316
00:31:31,253 --> 00:31:35,132
How come you didn't give me this contact
number so I could find you if I needed to?

317
00:31:35,213 --> 00:31:38,603
- You know why.
- I wasn't a good soldier, following orders?

318
00:31:38,693 --> 00:31:41,287
Somethin' like that.

319
00:31:41,373 --> 00:31:44,285
Guess I won't be invited
to the next X5 reunion.

320
00:31:45,973 --> 00:31:49,329
You're too reckless, Max.
I couldn't risk givin' it to you.

321
00:31:49,413 --> 00:31:53,804
- What if you got caught and Lydecker got it?
- I'm too much of a liability to be trusted?

322
00:31:53,893 --> 00:31:57,044
If you wanna get on board
with the way I do things, it's not too late.

323
00:31:57,133 --> 00:32:00,045
First step, though, is leaving Seattle.

324
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:05,645
I didn't think so. Especially not now.

325
00:32:05,733 --> 00:32:10,204
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talkin' about Miracle Boy over there.

326
00:32:23,453 --> 00:32:25,762
We got a lead on the girl in Portland.

327
00:32:25,853 --> 00:32:29,243
Good. Have 'em send us a chopper ASAP.

328
00:32:30,453 --> 00:32:32,523
I'll take care of this one myself.

329
00:32:35,093 --> 00:32:37,971
A message from Tinga.
Lydecker's on to her. She needs help.

330
00:33:05,053 --> 00:33:07,123
Come on, come on, come on! Move it!

331
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:24,247
- What's the secret?
- She was seen heading here.

332
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:27,370
We've secured the area
and I've got men along the perimeter.

333
00:33:27,453 --> 00:33:30,251
- She's here somewhere.
- Do you know what she looks like?

334
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:33,086
From when she
applied for work at the bakery.

335
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:39,326
All right. I want a point-to-point search,
with Tasers only. I want her alive.

336
00:33:47,733 --> 00:33:49,724
Come on, Zack.

337
00:33:49,853 --> 00:33:51,844
Where are you?

338
00:34:00,973 --> 00:34:03,441
- We're lookin' for this girl.
- Uh-uh.

339
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:11,608
- Seen this girl?
- No. I haven't seen her.

340
00:34:11,693 --> 00:34:13,923
- Do you recognise her?
- No.

341
00:34:18,173 --> 00:34:20,164
(soldier) All clear.

342
00:34:30,853 --> 00:34:32,366
There she is!

343
00:34:34,093 --> 00:34:36,368
(radio) She's movin' west!

344
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:40,487
Delta team, converge on target.
Alpha team, establish a perimeter.

345
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:43,322
Alpha team copy.

346
00:34:57,853 --> 00:34:59,650
- Delta team to Command.
- Go ahead.

347
00:34:59,733 --> 00:35:05,046
- We have the subject in sight. Will subdue.
- All right. Just remember I want her alive.

348
00:35:52,613 --> 00:35:54,604
(groaning)

349
00:35:55,813 --> 00:35:58,281
(footsteps)

350
00:36:24,653 --> 00:36:27,292
Is everybody in your family a thief?

351
00:36:30,413 --> 00:36:32,404
- Hit it.
- (engine starts)

352
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:39,170
- How much in the tank?
- Three-quarters.

353
00:36:39,253 --> 00:36:42,290
Oughta be enough
to get us to the Canadian border.

354
00:36:49,813 --> 00:36:51,883
Should I even ask?

355
00:36:53,773 --> 00:36:55,764
Let's go.

356
00:36:55,853 --> 00:36:58,367
- What about you?
- She's goin' back to Seattle.

357
00:36:59,213 --> 00:37:01,886
- You're not coming with us?
- Don't bother.

358
00:37:02,613 --> 00:37:04,843
- Lydecker...
- I said don't bother.

359
00:37:11,133 --> 00:37:13,931
You take care of yourself, baby sister.

360
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:16,004
You too.

361
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,212
Thanks for gettin' me out.

362
00:37:25,293 --> 00:37:27,284
Guess this makes us even.

363
00:37:28,893 --> 00:37:32,602
I guess so. Let's hope miracles come in twos,

364
00:37:32,693 --> 00:37:36,606
because you're gonna need one
to keep from gettin' caught.

365
00:37:52,493 --> 00:37:54,563
Still smokin'?

366
00:37:54,653 --> 00:37:57,690
- You lost him, Deck.
- It was a calculated risk.

367
00:37:57,773 --> 00:38:02,369
The information we got on the other X5s
more than made up for losing him.

368
00:38:02,453 --> 00:38:05,809
- If you say so.
- They were underground. We got them out.

369
00:38:06,133 --> 00:38:09,682
Made 'em go on the run.
No one on the run can avoid leaving a trail.

370
00:38:10,093 --> 00:38:12,209
Not even my kids.

371
00:38:12,653 --> 00:38:17,010
The committee has decided that
the X5 situation needs to be resolved.

372
00:38:17,693 --> 00:38:21,766
You're hereby authorised to use
whatever means necessary to see that it is.

373
00:38:21,853 --> 00:38:25,289
Am I to understand
that you include using deadly force?

374
00:38:26,693 --> 00:38:29,207
- If that's what it takes.
- We wanted them alive.

375
00:38:29,293 --> 00:38:31,682
The committee wants
this situation resolved.

376
00:38:31,773 --> 00:38:34,128
You know I'm gonna have
to go up the line on this?

377
00:38:34,213 --> 00:38:38,286
Don't bother. She signed the directive.

378
00:38:38,373 --> 00:38:40,329
(scoffs)

379
00:38:40,413 --> 00:38:42,768
She asked me to pass on a personal message.

380
00:38:43,933 --> 00:38:46,527
Do you have a problem executing the order?

381
00:38:48,813 --> 00:38:50,804
She'll find somebody else to do it.

382
00:38:52,893 --> 00:38:55,248
That won't be necessary.

383
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,922
I didn't think it would be.

384
00:39:00,893 --> 00:39:05,887
She looks just like I remember. I wish I could
have spent more time with her, though.

385
00:39:05,973 --> 00:39:09,283
Find out what her life's been like,
what she's been up to.

386
00:39:09,373 --> 00:39:12,809
Maybe after everything settles down
you two can hook up.

387
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:16,852
- How?
- Last number dialled. Zack's contact number.

388
00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:20,884
Oh!

389
00:39:21,573 --> 00:39:26,249
I can't believe it. He usually
covers his tracks way better than this.

390
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:28,722
- You'd think, huh?
- Thanks.

391
00:39:29,853 --> 00:39:31,844
You got anything to eat?

392
00:39:31,933 --> 00:39:34,003
Why don't you go see for yourself?

393
00:39:42,653 --> 00:39:45,292
You got a half a poulet chez Cale,

394
00:39:46,493 --> 00:39:48,484
leafy green stuff,

395
00:39:52,213 --> 00:39:54,886
mashed potatoes.

396
00:39:54,973 --> 00:39:58,648
What do you say we have that dinner?
Promise I won't bail on you this time.

397
00:39:58,733 --> 00:40:01,770
Uh... I have to take a rain check.
I've got some work to do.

398
00:40:01,853 --> 00:40:03,844
Oh. OK.

399
00:40:05,973 --> 00:40:08,123
You can take it with you if you want.

400
00:40:16,053 --> 00:40:18,806
No, I'll get something on the way home.

401
00:40:20,093 --> 00:40:22,129
OK. Night.

402
00:40:39,893 --> 00:40:42,123
(ringing tone)

403
00:40:42,213 --> 00:40:45,205
The number you have reached
is not in service at this time

404
00:40:45,293 --> 00:40:47,284
and there is no new number.

405
00:40:47,373 --> 00:40:50,683
Please be sure you have checked
the directory for the right number,

406
00:40:50,773 --> 00:40:52,764
and you are dialling correct...

407
00:40:56,653 --> 00:41:00,646
I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
I mean, it's like I said.

408
00:41:00,733 --> 00:41:03,645
Zack usually covers his tracks pretty good.

409
00:41:03,733 --> 00:41:06,691
I just didn't think he'd cover them from me.

410
00:41:06,773 --> 00:41:10,732
Must be a guy thing,
cos Logan can cover pretty good, too.

411
00:41:11,653 --> 00:41:16,329
Maybe it's me. Maybe there's something in
the way I'm made that turns people away.

412
00:41:16,413 --> 00:41:18,881
All I know is, it was easier before,

413
00:41:18,973 --> 00:41:21,806
when I just didn't
give a damn about anything.

414
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:52,126
