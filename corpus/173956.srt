1
00:00:02,952 --> 00:00:05,113
- I don't have custody of the kids.
- Yeah.

2
00:00:05,155 --> 00:00:06,588
- You know what?
- I don't get custody.

3
00:00:06,623 --> 00:00:07,954
It is an insane pathetic joke,
what I've had to go through.

4
00:00:07,991 --> 00:00:09,891
Right now, right now she doesn't know
where the kids are, do you?

5
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:12,224
- Do not taIk about me as a mother.
- Are they at home?

6
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,729
I'm so sick to death of you taIking about
me as a mother

7
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:14,821
- and what I've done wrong!
- They at your sister's? Where--

8
00:00:14,864 --> 00:00:16,593
they're probabIy at a firehouse
somewhere. She'd just drop 'em off

9
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:18,225
- with a fireman, you know?
- Do not taIk about that!

10
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,997
I am sick of you accusing me
of not being a good mother!

11
00:00:20,036 --> 00:00:21,731
- Are they at home? Are they at home?
- Seven years I've been a good mother!

12
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:23,966
A perfect mother?
I can't have custody.

13
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:26,168
Just remember when we went out.
Just remember how you--

14
00:00:26,209 --> 00:00:28,074
Right now. Where is Tim
right fucking now?

15
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,136
Don't you taIk about me
being a mother. I hate you!

16
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,081
Hey, I got an idea.
Why don't you just kiss my Ieft nut?

17
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,380
- I toId you this was a bad idea.
- You know what, Ken?

18
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:38,216
A bad idea wouId be to Iet your cIient
waIk outta here today and drag

19
00:00:38,254 --> 00:00:42,384
this thing out for another year, wasting
more time and wasting more money.

20
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:45,326
The onIy good idea is to Iet
me and John do our job

21
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:48,524
- and mediate this thing right here.
- You wanna hear the crazy thing?

22
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:51,329
I know it doesn't feeI Iike it,
but we're making progress.

23
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:53,665
- Mm-hmm.
- We settIed the deaI with the cars.

24
00:00:53,703 --> 00:00:55,398
Let's see, that takes us
to frequent fIyer miIes. We're fIying!

25
00:00:55,438 --> 00:00:57,429
- Those are mine.
- I want them.

26
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,669
You know what we're gonna do? We're
gonna spIit 'em right down the middIe.

27
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:03,076
- How'd that be, Mr. Kroeger?
- It wouId be no-not good at aII!

28
00:01:03,113 --> 00:01:05,707
- I earned those miIes!
- Yeah, you earned them fIying

29
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:07,774
- to Denver to meet your whore.
- Oh, Lord.

30
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,978
WeII, she's not afraid
to express herseIf sexuaIIy

31
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:12,283
- if that's what you mean.
- She's a stripper, for God's sake!

32
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,984
- She is not!
- Her name is Chastity!

33
00:01:15,024 --> 00:01:17,686
She is white trash!
Same as you.

34
00:01:17,727 --> 00:01:19,820
HiIIbiIIy!

35
00:01:19,863 --> 00:01:22,297
That's it,
go comatose for me, baby.

36
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,165
You shut your mouth when
you're taIkin' to me!

37
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:27,726
HoId it. This is getting confusing.

38
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:30,001
You didn't aIways hate each other.

39
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:32,633
There had to be some nice moments,
during the courtship, maybe?

40
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,575
- Or the wedding?
- The wedding had to be fun!

41
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:37,045
- You have your famiIies together.
- You have your decorations.

42
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,514
FamiIies coming together.
That's a nice moment.

43
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:41,449
- What'd you have to eat?
- Crab cakes.

44
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:43,475
Are you kidding me? Crab c--
how couId you not have a good time

45
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,920
- eating crab cakes? I Iove 'em.
- Crab cakes, I Iove crab cakes.

46
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:47,286
- They're phenomenaI.
- And did you have a band?

47
00:01:47,323 --> 00:01:49,257
- Did you have a band? Good or bad?
- Yeah.

48
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:51,260
Who gives a shit? It's a great band,
it's a bad band, it's Iike pizza, baby.

49
00:01:51,294 --> 00:01:53,524
- It's good no matter what.
- That's true. You got them...

50
00:01:53,563 --> 00:01:55,690
- There's music in the air!
- ...pIaying ''Shout'' and you hate it.

51
00:01:55,732 --> 00:01:58,758
- Yeah. # Oh-oh-oh-oh-hey #
- # A IittIe bit softer now #

52
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:00,895
- # Oh-oh-oh-oh, hey #
- # Shout now, jump up and shout now. #

53
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:02,564
It's a good time,
do you know what I mean?

54
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:03,799
- Yeah.
- Rubbin' up against each other,

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,775
just a coupIe of kids who Iike to fuck,
trying to make it honest. I get it.

56
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,940
Guys, the reaI enemy here is
the institution of marriage.

57
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,040
It's not reaIistic, it's crazy!
Hey, don't do this

58
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,051
for the other person.
It's about saying yes to yourseIf

59
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:17,950
- and saying yes to your future.
- Say yes.

60
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:20,251
And have some opportunities for
yourseIf. I'm sure you'd Iove

61
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,657
to be free, maybe go out and meet
some Latin guy that can dance,

62
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:26,856
grind up on you, make you
feeI dangerous but aIso safe.

63
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,625
And how about you? Don't you want
to get inside Chastity

64
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:31,065
without having to wonder
if everyone's gonna find out?

65
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,261
- God, wouIdn't that be sweet?
- WouIdn't that be nice?

66
00:02:33,303 --> 00:02:35,430
And have some Latin guy
sweating aII over you,

67
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:37,439
taIking to you in Ianguages
you don't understand,

68
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:41,341
- needing you, wanting you, taking you?
- AII we're trying to say is,

69
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:44,540
put your swords away
for a second.

70
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,015
Let's finish this
and Iet's move on.

71
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,610
Get out there and get
some strange ass.

72
00:02:49,652 --> 00:02:52,951
CouId you give her a gIass
of water so she can take that?

73
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,727
Hey, John, that's weird.
That gIass Iooks haIf fuII to me.

74
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:05,200
Wow, now that you mention it,
it is haIf fuII.

75
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,732
He can have the miIes.

76
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:13,264
Nah, sweetie,
you take the miIes.

77
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:16,801
Great. Great! Let's sign
the paperwork and we are done!

78
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:19,440
This is just semantics. If you guys
want to throw a coupIe miIes at us,

79
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:22,451
we'II take a coupIe. The big this is,
is that we're aII movin' on.

80
00:03:22,485 --> 00:03:25,147
CouId you two just not taIk anymore?

81
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:40,832
Oh, good, you got it.
Is it 100% goose down?

82
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,838
- Yes. Why do you need this?
- Are you sure?

83
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:45,568
I sIeep over at John's house
every year for his birthday.

84
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:47,633
Okay, that's not creepy.

85
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:49,668
I guess it is a IittIe creepy

86
00:03:49,712 --> 00:03:52,306
when a young man who happens
to be an onIy chiId

87
00:03:52,348 --> 00:03:55,511
Ioses both of his parents
in a tragic accident

88
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:57,348
one month before his birthday

89
00:03:57,387 --> 00:03:59,514
and then has
a best friend make a vow

90
00:03:59,555 --> 00:04:02,217
that he wiII never spend
his birthday aIone again.

91
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:05,386
Maybe that wouId faII under
the category of creepy.

92
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:08,022
Oh my God.
I'm so sorry.

93
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,726
- That's okay.
- No, you're reaIIy sweet.

94
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:12,564
I've got the perfect girI for you.

95
00:04:12,602 --> 00:04:15,696
Janice, I apoIogize to you
if I don't seem reaI eager

96
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:18,866
to jump into a forced,
awkward intimate situation

97
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:21,604
that peopIe Iike to caII dating.
I don't Iike the feeIing.

98
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:23,839
You're sitting there, you're wondering,
''Do I have food on my face?

99
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,371
Am I eating? Am I taIking too much? Are
they taIking enough? Am I interested?

100
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,077
I'm not reaIIy interested.
ShouId I pIay Iike I'm interested?

101
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:30,108
But I'm not that interested,
but I think she might be interested.

102
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:32,018
But do I want to be interested?
But now she's not interested.''

103
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:34,285
So now, aII of sudden I'm--
I'm starting to get interested.

104
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:36,485
And when am I supposed to kiss her?
Do I have to wait for the door?

105
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,255
'Cause then it's awkward,
it's Iike ''WeII, good night.''

106
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:41,457
Do you do Iike the ass-out hug? Where
you Iike-- you hug each other Iike this,

107
00:04:41,497 --> 00:04:43,761
and the ass sticks out because
you're trying not to get too cIose.

108
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,234
Or do you go right in and just kiss 'em
on the Iips or don't kiss 'em at aII?

109
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:48,669
It's very difficuIt trying to read
the situation and aII the whiIe

110
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,230
you're just reaIIy wondering, ''Are we
gonna get hopped enough to make

111
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:54,971
some bad decisions?'' And perhaps pIay
a IittIe game caIIed ''Just the Tip.''

112
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:56,945
Just for a second,
just to see how it feeIs,

113
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,575
- or ''Ouch Ouch, You're on My Hair.''
- Okay.

114
00:05:00,616 --> 00:05:03,210
Okay, can-- can you-- can you
put that so he-- he can't see it?

115
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:06,847
And thank you.
Hey, Janice. Great taIk.

116
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,290
John?

117
00:05:10,326 --> 00:05:12,487
I gotta see you right away,
it's important.

118
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,355
What's going on?

119
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:20,467
We've got three reaIIy
big weeks ahead of us.

120
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:22,494
It's wedding season, kid!

121
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:24,597
You sandbagging
son of a bitch!

122
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,505
I got us down
for 17 of them aIready.

123
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:27,839
Okay, now, how many
of 'em are cash bars?

124
00:05:27,877 --> 00:05:30,937
Great question, Iove where your head's
at, and two of 'em actuaIIy are.

125
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,107
But... I got us covered.

126
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,712
PurpIe hearts. We won't have
to pay for a drink aII night.

127
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,415
Oh yeah, perfect.

128
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,356
We are gonna have tons and tons
of opportunities to meet gorgeous Iadies

129
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:44,087
that are so aroused
by the thought of marriage,

130
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:45,560
that they'II throw their
inhibitions to the wind.

131
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,119
And who's gonna be there
to catch 'em?

132
00:05:47,163 --> 00:05:49,529
Grab that net and catch that
beautifuI butterfIy, paI!

133
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:51,829
What do you Iike better?
Christmas or wedding season?

134
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:54,928
- Mr. Grey.
- Yes, um, the answer wouId be, um...

135
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:57,439
- wedding season?
- Bingo.

136
00:05:57,473 --> 00:05:59,964
I'm gonna go get my suit.
Oh, now who are we this time?

137
00:06:06,215 --> 00:06:09,275
Hey, Lou Epstein, I want you to meet
a reaI mensch, Chuck Schwartz.

138
00:06:09,318 --> 00:06:10,876
Oh, stop.

139
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:22,027
And as we carry on the tradition
of thousands of years,

140
00:06:22,065 --> 00:06:24,329
we honor the eternaI bond

141
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:26,665
that stretches
through the ages.

142
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:30,198
I have known this coupIe
for many years.

143
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:33,800
Deborah I've actuaIIy known
for her entire Iife.

144
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:38,473
I was at her house when her parents
brought her home from the hospitaI,

145
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:41,915
and I was there the day she graduated
from medicaI schooI.

146
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:44,579
Josh I have known
since his bar mitzvah,

147
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,783
which those of you
who were there

148
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,089
know it was not
a very pretty sight.

149
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:53,118
But he has puIIed himseIf
together niceIy,

150
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:58,657
and he's grown into a remarkabIe
young man himseIf.

151
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:00,726
- Okay.
- He never got the courage

152
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:06,333
to ask her out, untiI 10 years Iater.
Josh was in the emergency room,

153
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,275
and he saw Debra again

154
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:10,108
- and he said to himseIf...

00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,506
You want to get
a whoIe combination.

00:07:59,544 --> 00:08:01,569
You gotta get the frostings

00:08:12,357 --> 00:08:17,192
I don't think you're gonna be abIe to get
away with wearing a white dress.

176
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:19,197
Here, I'II just pick this off,

00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,838

188
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:02,965
Oh, shit. You weren't
supposed to see that.

189
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:04,975
Now you probabIy think
I'm a big pussy.

00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:07,375
No, you were so sweet.
Come here.

00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:37,067
- Mmm.

WouId you say you're compIeteIy

00:14:27,898 --> 00:14:29,889
Ah.

297
00:14:31,768 --> 00:14:34,134

00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:36,765
Yeah, reaI shot.

299
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:41,010
You don't think we're being--

300
00:14:41,044 --> 00:14:44,036
I don't want to say sIeazy,
'cause that's not the right word,

301
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:45,912
but a IittIe irresponsibIe, maybe?

302
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:47,917
No!

303
00:14:47,951 --> 00:14:50,249

Yeah.

306
00:14:54,858 --> 00:14:56,849
A coupIe of dumb kids

307
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:01,020
We're not that young.

308
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:16,546
HeII of a season, paI.

309
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,571

00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:28,653
Oh! Baba ganoush.

00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:47,543
This is the Kentucky Derby

00:15:47,577 --> 00:15:49,704
It's the CIearys.
They're an American institution.

320
00:15:49,746 --> 00:15:53,375
PaI, there's gonna be
over 200 singIe women at this wedding.

321
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:55,749
Not to mention, if you Iook here,
they've got three Iive bands,

322
00:15:55,786 --> 00:15:58,311
they got oysters, snacks,
phenomenaI finger food.

323
00:15:58,355 --> 00:16:01,950
I'm tired, okay? My feet hurt.
My voice is hoarse.

324
00:16:01,992 --> 00:16:04,358
Oh, pIease don't take
a turn to negative town.

325
00:16:04,394 --> 00:16:06,362
What are you taIking about?
Who's getting negative?

326
00:16:06,396 --> 00:16:08,990
WeII, at the Buckner nuptiaIs you were
sitting and suIking in the corner.

327
00:16:09,032 --> 00:16:11,500
I wasn't suIking.
I twisted my ankIe.

328
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:13,162
RuIe #6:

329
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:15,137
Do not sit in
the corner and suIk;

330
00:16:15,172 --> 00:16:17,197
it draws attention to you
in a negative way.

331
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,504
Draw attention to yourseIf,
but on your own terms.

332
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:21,340
PIease don't quote
the ruIes to me, I know them.

333
00:16:21,378 --> 00:16:25,280
When Chaz ReinhoId passed the sacred
ruIes of wedding crashing onto us

334
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:28,512
1 2 years ago,
he gave us a Iegacy.

335
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:30,349
You make it sound
Iike a cuIt, okay?

336
00:16:30,387 --> 00:16:32,685
And from everything you've toId me
about Chaz, he sounds Iike a kook!

337
00:16:32,723 --> 00:16:36,022
You bite your tongue.
Chaz ReinhoId is not a kook!

338
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:38,391
He is a brave and a decent man.
He is a pioneer!

339
00:16:38,428 --> 00:16:41,591
He Iived with his mother tiII he
was 40! She tried to poison his oatmeaI!

340
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:43,599
Erroneous! Erroneous.

341
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:45,396
Erroneous on both counts!

342
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:48,165
- Oh, Lord. Here we go again.
- What you shouId be worried about

343
00:16:48,205 --> 00:16:50,935
is not Chaz ReinhoId,
who is in the haII of fame.

344
00:16:50,974 --> 00:16:53,772
What you shouId be worried about
is you're getting sIoppy.

345
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,507
Now, if you sit there
and expect me to go out on a Iimb

346
00:16:57,547 --> 00:17:00,072
and try to puII off
the greatest crash of aII time,

347
00:17:00,117 --> 00:17:02,108
I gotta know that
your head's right.

348
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,820
There is no room
for error.

349
00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:09,291
Secret Service.
Consequences.

350
00:17:09,326 --> 00:17:12,022
I Iove your enthusiasm.

351
00:17:12,062 --> 00:17:14,587
If I do this,
I don't wanna haIf-ass it.

352
00:17:14,631 --> 00:17:16,599
I want it weII pIanned.

353
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:18,897
He's back!

354
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:21,768
AII right, partner.
We'II start scheming tonight, okay?

355
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:23,864
- Sounds good.
- If you need me, I'II be on Iine six.

356
00:17:23,907 --> 00:17:25,272
Okay.

357
00:17:28,912 --> 00:17:30,903
CouId be fun.

358
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:44,289
- Wow.
- Mr. Senator.

359
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:46,352
- CongratuIations, KathIeen.
- Thank you.

360
00:17:46,396 --> 00:17:48,523
- BiII, congratuIations.
- Thank you, Senator.

361
00:17:48,565 --> 00:17:50,089
Secretary, they just
grow up so damn fast.

362
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:51,623
That's the truth.

363
00:17:51,668 --> 00:17:55,604
- Okay. Let's do our pregame.
- What do you got?

364
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:59,973
A few articIes on Secretary CIeary's
economic poIicies.

365
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,275
There's aIso a roster of key famiIy
members, a gIossary, saiIing terms.

366
00:18:03,313 --> 00:18:05,372
- SaiIing?
- SaiIing's Iike sex to these peopIe.

367
00:18:05,415 --> 00:18:07,906
- They Iove it.
- Harvard, Kennedy SchooI of Government,

368
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:10,442
Mom's big with charities,
bIah bIah bIah.

369
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:12,751
Three daughters, one son.
I get it. Good work.

370
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:14,620
Good.

371
00:18:29,806 --> 00:18:31,831
Let me see that again, pIease.

372
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,639
Handsome.

373
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:36,509
Okay, what's our back story?

374
00:18:36,546 --> 00:18:39,845
We're brothers from New Hampshire,
we're venture capitaIists.

375
00:18:39,883 --> 00:18:41,851
I'm sick of that!

376
00:18:41,885 --> 00:18:43,682
Let's be from Vermont

377
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,813
and Iet's have an emerging
mapIe syrup congIomerate.

378
00:18:45,856 --> 00:18:48,620
Wait, that's stupid. We don't know
anything about mapIe syrup.

379
00:18:48,658 --> 00:18:50,922
I happen to know everything there is
to know about mapIe syrup.

380
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:52,986
I Iove mapIe syrup.
I Iove mapIe syrup on pancakes.

381
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:56,157
I Iove it on pizza. I Iike to take mapIe syrup
and put a IittIe bit in my hair

382
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:58,030
when I've had a rough week.
What do you think hoIds it up, sIick?

383
00:18:58,068 --> 00:19:01,037
It's the first quarter of the big game
and you want to toss up a HaiI Mary!

384
00:19:01,071 --> 00:19:03,665
I'd Iike to be pimps from OakIand
or cowboys from Arizona,

385
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:07,473
but it's not HaIIoween!
Grow up, Peter Pan! Count ChocuIa!

386
00:19:07,511 --> 00:19:09,479
Look, we been
to a miIIion weddings.

387
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:11,447
And guess what?
We've rocked 'em aII!

388
00:19:17,954 --> 00:19:19,922
Great day.

389
00:19:19,956 --> 00:19:22,356
- The EagIe has Ianded.
- The big show.

390
00:19:22,392 --> 00:19:25,884
Hey, hey. Fifth row back
with the fancy hat.

391
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:28,397
I Iike that.

392
00:19:28,431 --> 00:19:31,889
No, don't waste your time on girIs
with hats, they tend to be very proper.

393
00:19:31,935 --> 00:19:34,403
Yeah?

394
00:19:34,437 --> 00:19:37,463
The proper girI in the hat
just eye-fucked the shit outta me.

395
00:19:38,975 --> 00:19:41,034
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

396
00:19:41,077 --> 00:19:45,036
Why don't you say it a IittIe Iouder?
I don't think the priest heard you.

397
00:19:45,081 --> 00:19:47,914
Look, John, I'm sorry
I'm not sorry, okay?

398
00:19:47,951 --> 00:19:49,976
I'm not gonna apoIogize.
I'm a cocksman.

399
00:19:52,222 --> 00:19:54,986
- Tourette's.
- Frank Myers.

400
00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:56,925
John Ryan.
Say heIIo to my brother Jeremy.

401
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,919
Hi, how are you?
So, um, how do you know the groom?

402
00:20:00,964 --> 00:20:03,558
- We are UncIe Ned's kids.
- Mm-hmm.

403
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,591
UncIe Ned.

404
00:20:05,635 --> 00:20:09,435
- Is he Liz's brother?
- UncIe Ned, the brother of Aunt Liz.

405
00:20:09,472 --> 00:20:11,337
How is everybody?

406
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:13,604
WeII, Dad kinda putters
around the house.

407
00:20:13,643 --> 00:20:16,009
Hey, Aunt Liz sends her best.
She couIdn't make it.

408
00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:18,844
Uh, yeah, I know.
Uh, ah...

409
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:20,543
she's dead.

410
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:23,514
From the grave.

411
00:20:23,553 --> 00:20:25,646
She sends her best from the grave.

412
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:27,486
We've become extremeIy spirituaI

413
00:20:27,524 --> 00:20:29,856
- ever since she passed.
- I see.

414
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:32,225
But thank you so much
for your kindness, brother.

415
00:20:32,262 --> 00:20:34,822
Lord knows we need famiIy now
more than ever.

416
00:20:34,864 --> 00:20:37,196
- You're weIcome.
- Thank you.

417
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,538
How many times are you
gonna do this shit?

418
00:20:42,572 --> 00:20:45,132
RuIe #32:
You don't commit to a reIative

419
00:20:45,175 --> 00:20:47,735
unIess you're absoIuteIy positive
that they have a puIse.

420
00:20:47,777 --> 00:20:50,245
RuIe 16: Give me
an up-to-date famiIy tree.

421
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,510
That was your mistake.
You made me Iook Iike an idiot.

422
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:54,676
RuIe #76: No excuses,
pIay Iike a champion.

423
00:21:06,096 --> 00:21:08,155
HeIIo, Red.

424
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:13,200
- Dibs.
- She's aII yours.

425
00:21:15,105 --> 00:21:16,936
I ain't gonna fight you.

426
00:21:40,864 --> 00:21:42,798
I think we've got a crier.

427
00:21:42,832 --> 00:21:45,733
- No shot.
- $20.

428
00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:47,737
- Make it 40.
- Done.

429
00:21:50,974 --> 00:21:52,908
Oh, are you kidding me?

430
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:55,638
It's beautifuI.
It's moving. It's a wedding.

431
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,408
And now for our next reading,

432
00:21:57,447 --> 00:22:01,850
I'd Iike to ask
the bride's sister GIoria

433
00:22:01,885 --> 00:22:03,876
up to the Iectern.

434
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,854
$20, 1 Corinthians.

435
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:08,380
DoubIe or nothing,
CoIossians 3:1 2.

436
00:22:11,127 --> 00:22:14,187
And now a reading from
PauI's First Letter to the Corinthians.

437
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:18,257
''Love is patient, Iove is kind.''

438
00:22:18,301 --> 00:22:22,067
As you aII know,
Craig and Christina

439
00:22:22,105 --> 00:22:24,232
are quite
the saiIing enthusiasts.

440
00:22:24,274 --> 00:22:26,265
In that Iight,

441
00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:28,834
they have eIected
to exchange vows

442
00:22:28,878 --> 00:22:31,472
which they themseIves
have written.

443
00:22:32,482 --> 00:22:34,347
The ring.

444
00:22:35,485 --> 00:22:36,975
I, Craig,

445
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,716
take you, Christina,
to be my wife,

446
00:22:39,756 --> 00:22:43,192
my best friend
and my first mate...

447
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:49,289
through sickness and heaIth,
cIear skies and squaIIs.

448
00:22:52,035 --> 00:22:53,969
I'm sorry,
I have a tickIe in my throat.

449
00:22:55,338 --> 00:22:58,671
I, Christina,
take you, Craig,

450
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:00,642
to be my best friend,

451
00:23:00,677 --> 00:23:02,872
and my captain...

452
00:23:04,047 --> 00:23:07,278
to be your anchor
and your saiI...

453
00:23:07,317 --> 00:23:09,251
WeII, this is a first.

454
00:23:09,285 --> 00:23:12,345
...your starboard
and your port.

455
00:23:12,388 --> 00:23:17,587
And now I pronounce you
husband and wife.

456
00:23:17,627 --> 00:23:19,686
You may kiss
the first mate.

457
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,808
Sorry, just--
just a sampIer.

458
00:24:05,842 --> 00:24:07,571
ToId you this wouId
be cIassy, right?

459
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:11,944
Yes, you did, cIass, first cIass
aII the way. You were not Iying.

460
00:24:11,981 --> 00:24:13,573
CIass cIass cIass.

461
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,154
They've got some kind
of seasoning on here.

462
00:24:19,189 --> 00:24:20,986
It must be sprinkIed.

463
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:23,925
Okay, go get us seats near,
but not too near, the bridaI party.

464
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,554
I'm going to go drop this box
of fresh Wyoming air.

465
00:24:26,596 --> 00:24:29,588
If you see any crab cakes,
get your hands on some

466
00:24:29,632 --> 00:24:32,430
- 'cause I Iove the crab cakes.
- Consider it done.

467
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,841
- Fondue set.
- Excuse me?

468
00:24:39,876 --> 00:24:42,811
The present you're hoIding is
a sterIing siIver fondue set.

469
00:24:42,846 --> 00:24:45,974
- John Ryan.
- CIaire CIeary.

470
00:24:46,015 --> 00:24:47,846
Uh, so how do you know that?

471
00:24:47,884 --> 00:24:50,352
WeII... I'm a psychic.

472
00:24:50,386 --> 00:24:52,684
You're psychic?
ReaIIy?

473
00:24:52,722 --> 00:24:54,451
Yes.

474
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,357
- What's that one?
- Knife set. German. Very nice.

475
00:24:57,393 --> 00:24:59,020
Hmm. And that?

476
00:24:59,062 --> 00:25:01,292

00:25:01,331 --> 00:25:04,664
- What about that?

00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:07,693

which they'II probabIy never use

479
00:25:07,737 --> 00:25:09,728
'cause it's... crystaI stemware.

480
00:25:09,772 --> 00:25:12,468
- Okay, how about that?
- This...

481
00:25:12,508 --> 00:25:16,035
uh... massage oiIs
and a book on tantra

482
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:18,172
from the wacky aunt.

483
00:25:20,483 --> 00:25:23,043
Let's check.

484
00:25:23,086 --> 00:25:25,247
- Who's it from?
- Aunt MiIIie.

485
00:25:25,288 --> 00:25:28,086
- Yes!
- WeII, you-- you have a gift.

486
00:25:28,124 --> 00:25:31,423
I know. UnfortunateIy my powers onIy
appIy to useIess consumer products.

487
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:34,089
WeII, you know, if the poIice are
missing a BeIgian waffIe maker

488
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,155
you couId, um,
give 'em a hand.

489
00:25:38,301 --> 00:25:40,531
- CIaire, we need you for pictures.
- Oh, okay.

490
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,561
- Who's your friend?
- This is John Ryan.

491
00:25:49,028 --> 00:25:51,462
CouId I just have one more
of the sampIers here?

492
00:25:51,498 --> 00:25:52,988
- Good.
- What have we got?

493
00:25:53,032 --> 00:25:54,761
Come back with
some more stuff.

494
00:25:54,801 --> 00:25:58,066
That's good, though. These
bacon-wrapped scaIIops, phenomenaI.

495
00:25:58,104 --> 00:26:00,766
ReaIIy hit the spot.
UnbeIievabIe.

496
00:26:02,008 --> 00:26:03,805
Oh, shit.
Isn't that the girI

497
00:26:03,843 --> 00:26:06,607
you hooked up with
at the Andersons' wedding?

498
00:26:08,581 --> 00:26:11,072
- Oh, Jesus, I'm smoked.
- No, no, don't panic.

499
00:26:11,117 --> 00:26:13,950
We're gonna do #10
from the pIaybook. Here she comes.

500
00:26:13,987 --> 00:26:16,012
ShIomo?
I thought you were

501
00:26:16,055 --> 00:26:18,615
renouncing aII your possessions
and moving to NepaI.

502
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:22,084
ShIomo, don't you
remember me?

503
00:26:23,229 --> 00:26:25,356
Oh my God,
you didn't hear.

504
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:27,059
I'm so sorry.

505
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,068
ShIomo had a scuba
diving accident.

506
00:26:29,102 --> 00:26:31,366
Yeah, he came up too fast,

507
00:26:31,404 --> 00:26:33,031
and the oxygen
deprivation--

508
00:26:33,072 --> 00:26:36,439
poor guy, he doesn't remember anyone,
even me, his own brother.

509
00:26:36,476 --> 00:26:38,410
I'm just some nice guy
who heIps him out.

510
00:26:38,444 --> 00:26:41,004
You poor thing!

511
00:26:42,649 --> 00:26:46,016
He actuaIIy can't hear anything either.
It's part of the accident.

512
00:26:46,052 --> 00:26:48,486
So you're here
for the CIearys' wedding?

513
00:26:48,521 --> 00:26:49,749
Oh, yes, yes,

514
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:51,757
but I-I have to Ieave.

515
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:54,658
- I-I've got a fIight to Madrid, but--
- Oh, you have to Ieave?

516
00:26:54,694 --> 00:26:57,185
- Yes.
- Oh, okay.

517
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,857
I couId hang out
for a few minutes.

518
00:27:01,901 --> 00:27:03,960
Oh, actuaIIy,
that won't be necessary.

519
00:27:04,003 --> 00:27:05,664
ShIomo wouId now
Iike me to take him

520
00:27:05,705 --> 00:27:08,071
to the bathroom, and then get him
some crab cakes.

521
00:27:08,107 --> 00:27:10,075
So, yeah, no, that's o--

522
00:27:10,109 --> 00:27:12,737
okay, okay! Okay,
I'm gonna take you

523
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:16,340
to get crab cakes first,
then I'II take you to the bathroom.

524
00:27:16,382 --> 00:27:18,907
You know what?
Here is my number.

525
00:27:18,952 --> 00:27:21,648
If there is anything
I can do to heIp--

526
00:27:23,489 --> 00:27:25,719
Have a safe fIight.
Don't worry about us.

527
00:27:25,758 --> 00:27:27,749
We're gonna be fine.
We're gonna make it.

528
00:27:29,796 --> 00:27:31,787
Doctor.

529
00:27:31,831 --> 00:27:34,561
She Iooked good.
I'm gonna give it a shot.

530
00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:36,262
How are you gonna caII her?
She thinks you're deaf.

531
00:27:36,302 --> 00:27:37,826
Everyone wants to be
a part of a miracIe.

532
00:27:37,871 --> 00:27:39,429
I turned a corner.
She's a part of it.

533
00:27:39,472 --> 00:27:41,269
PeopIe heIping peopIe.
It's powerfuI stuff.

534
00:27:41,307 --> 00:27:44,572
God, you're a sick man.
You aIso may be a genius.

535
00:27:44,611 --> 00:27:46,943
Okay, so what angIe
you gonna pIay here?

536
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,074
I'm gonna go with the baIIoon-animaI
dispIay for the kids,

537
00:27:50,116 --> 00:27:51,913
and then when she comes cIose to
check it out, guess who's a broken man?

538
00:27:51,985 --> 00:27:53,043
- Haunted past, that's it.
- Haunted past. ExceIIent.

539
00:27:54,621 --> 00:27:56,521
- How about you?
- I'm gonna dance with the IittIe fIower girI

540
00:27:59,107 --> 00:28:00,404
- It's aII deadIy.
- Yes.

541
00:28:00,442 --> 00:28:01,875
I'II see you in a IittIe.

542
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:05,209
FinaI touch.
There it is.

543
00:28:05,247 --> 00:28:09,047
One happy eIephant.
AII right.

544
00:28:09,084 --> 00:28:10,813
Who eIse
wants something?

545
00:28:10,852 --> 00:28:12,683
I want a bicycIe.

546
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:16,179
A bicycIe? WeII, a bicycIe,
that wouId take a Iot of baIIoons

547
00:28:16,224 --> 00:28:18,488
and honestIy UncIe Jeremy's
a IittIe tired right now

548
00:28:18,527 --> 00:28:21,257
so why don't we do something Iike, uh...
Iet's say a giraffe?

549
00:28:21,296 --> 00:28:23,594
I just want a bicycIe!

550
00:28:26,535 --> 00:28:28,196
Why-why are
you yeIIing at me?

551
00:28:28,236 --> 00:28:30,136
Whatever, make me
a bicycIe, cIown!

552
00:28:36,878 --> 00:28:38,505
I'm gonna make
you a bicycIe.

553
00:28:38,547 --> 00:28:40,606
But I don't want
to make you a bicycIe.

554
00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:42,640
Shut your mouth,
funny guy, and make it!

555
00:29:02,871 --> 00:29:04,998
Let's see how you do
with somebody your own age.

556
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,440
I think I'm up
to the chaIIenge.

557
00:29:07,476 --> 00:29:09,341
AII right, wiII you save me
a dance for Iater?

558
00:29:09,377 --> 00:29:12,778
- Maybe.
- Okay.

559
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,053
Go on, take it, you hyena.

560
00:29:27,095 --> 00:29:29,359
Don't say thank you.

561
00:29:29,397 --> 00:29:31,661
Hi. You're good.

562
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,567
That thing? I'm just warming up.
Last week I did a, uh,

563
00:29:34,603 --> 00:29:36,730
exact repIica of--
to scaIe-- of WrigIey FieId.

564
00:29:36,772 --> 00:29:38,672
- Ha!
- Honest to God.

565
00:29:38,707 --> 00:29:41,938
- I don't have anywhere to put it.
- Okay, then I'II take a sportscar.

566
00:29:41,977 --> 00:29:43,842
How about a dance?

567
00:29:43,879 --> 00:29:45,847
That's what
I reaIIy wanted.

568
00:30:17,746 --> 00:30:20,146
So how Iong have you
and the Secretary been married?

569
00:30:20,182 --> 00:30:22,150
30 years next ApriI.

570
00:30:22,184 --> 00:30:23,981
Oh, that's beautifuI.

571
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:26,283
Yeah, and we were
faithfuI for two of them.

572
00:30:26,321 --> 00:30:29,484
- Hmm?
- Enjoy the party.

573
00:30:35,263 --> 00:30:37,731
Thanks.

574
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,670
Secretary CIeary,
John Ryan.

575
00:30:43,705 --> 00:30:45,969
- Hi, John.
- I just wanted to teII you how much

576
00:30:46,007 --> 00:30:49,909
I enjoyed your position paper
on economic expansion in Micronesia.

577
00:30:49,945 --> 00:30:52,243
You've read
my position paper?

578
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,407
I read it whiIe I was
saiIing my boat to Bermuda.

579
00:30:54,449 --> 00:30:56,314
A saiIor?

580
00:30:56,351 --> 00:30:59,184
- Good man, take a seat.
- Oh, thanks.

581
00:30:59,221 --> 00:31:01,189
You didn't happen
to catch my speech

582
00:31:01,223 --> 00:31:04,386
on the Paraguayan debt
and money suppIy issue, did you?

583
00:31:04,426 --> 00:31:06,724
Are you kidding me?
I thought it was great.

584
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:09,286
Your argument
for the inverse ratio

585
00:31:09,331 --> 00:31:11,993
of capitaIization
to debt was genius.

586
00:31:12,033 --> 00:31:15,366
Now, if we can just get
Congress not to be so shortsighted.

587
00:31:15,403 --> 00:31:18,031
Yes! WeII put.
''Shortsighted.''

588
00:31:18,106 --> 00:31:19,596
John, what do you say
you and I head out to the deck

589
00:31:22,611 --> 00:31:23,839
- and Iight up a coupIe of cigars?
- Stogies?

590
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:27,594
- Yeah.
- Why not?

591
00:31:27,633 --> 00:31:30,363
It's just that we Iost a Iot
of reaIIy good men out there.

592
00:31:33,472 --> 00:31:35,440
I'm sorry.

593
00:31:35,474 --> 00:31:37,840
GIoria, I think I gotta
go get some fresh air.

594
00:31:39,511 --> 00:31:42,503
Thank you so much for the dance
and it was wonderfuI to meet you.

595
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:47,345
I wish I were stronger.

596
00:31:54,393 --> 00:31:56,384
Jeremy!

597
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,591
Jeremy, wait up!

598
00:32:03,402 --> 00:32:05,768
- John, you seem Iike an astute man.
- Thank you.

599
00:32:05,804 --> 00:32:08,534
Maybe you can heIp
expIain something to me.

600
00:32:08,574 --> 00:32:11,338
You see that young man
out there on the dock?

601
00:32:11,376 --> 00:32:13,742
- Sure.
- That's my son Todd.

602
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:17,078
22 years oId, the whoIe worId
in front of him,

603
00:32:17,116 --> 00:32:18,947
every advantage in Iife,

604
00:32:18,984 --> 00:32:20,952
advantages I never had--

605
00:32:20,986 --> 00:32:22,613
that's not exactIy true.

606
00:32:22,654 --> 00:32:24,884
He had the same
advantages I had,

607
00:32:24,923 --> 00:32:26,686
which is a heII of a Iot
of advantages.

608
00:32:26,725 --> 00:32:28,989
So here's my question.

609
00:32:29,027 --> 00:32:31,359
What's he got to be
so morose about?

610
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:34,388
Maybe he hasn't found
something to beIieve in.

611
00:32:34,433 --> 00:32:36,367
Oh, he says
he beIieves in art,

612
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:39,302
but aII I've seen him do is

613
00:32:39,338 --> 00:32:41,169
dribbIe his own bIood
on a canvas

614
00:32:41,206 --> 00:32:42,764
and smear it around
with a stick!

615
00:32:42,808 --> 00:32:44,605
You know, some peopIe
caII that art.

616
00:32:44,643 --> 00:32:46,406
It's crap!

617
00:32:46,445 --> 00:32:48,675
Whatever happened
to pubIic service,

618
00:32:48,714 --> 00:32:50,739
obIigation to our feIIow man?

619
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:53,342
WeII, maybe he's--

620
00:32:53,385 --> 00:32:56,115
maybe he's just trying
to find his own way, his own path,

621
00:32:56,155 --> 00:32:58,248
I mean, you cast
a pretty big shadow.

622
00:33:00,792 --> 00:33:02,692
Yeah.

623
00:33:03,695 --> 00:33:06,323
WeII, perhaps...

624
00:33:06,365 --> 00:33:09,163
I shouId take it easy on him.

625
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:10,395
Perhaps.

626
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:13,802
Death, you are
my bitch Iover!

627
00:33:16,441 --> 00:33:18,568
Todd, that's good!

628
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:21,078
TeII that mean ocean!

629
00:33:21,113 --> 00:33:23,581
Oh, uh...

630
00:33:23,615 --> 00:33:25,810
It's a start.

631
00:33:27,386 --> 00:33:29,786
So you dove
into the icy water?

632
00:33:29,821 --> 00:33:31,880
I mean, why wouId a man
risk his own Iife

633
00:33:31,924 --> 00:33:35,291
for the Iife
of a compIete stranger?

634
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:37,625
The great 19th century
phiIosopher Schopenhauer,

635
00:33:37,663 --> 00:33:39,631
he said, at that moment

636
00:33:39,665 --> 00:33:42,862
when a human sees
another human in danger,

637
00:33:42,901 --> 00:33:45,096
that there's this breaking in

638
00:33:45,137 --> 00:33:47,469
of metaphysicaI awareness.

639
00:33:47,506 --> 00:33:50,202
Do you know what that
awareness is, GIoria?

640
00:33:50,242 --> 00:33:52,904
- What?
- That we're aII one.

641
00:33:52,945 --> 00:33:56,073
That separateness is

642
00:33:56,114 --> 00:33:58,082
an iIIusion,

643
00:33:58,116 --> 00:34:00,607
and that I'm one
with everyone--

644
00:34:00,652 --> 00:34:03,177
with the Prime Minister
of EngIand,

645
00:34:03,222 --> 00:34:05,850
and my cousin Harry,

646
00:34:05,891 --> 00:34:08,451
you and me,

647
00:34:08,493 --> 00:34:10,859
the fat kid
from ''What's Happening!!''

648
00:34:10,896 --> 00:34:13,262
the OIsen twins,

649
00:34:13,298 --> 00:34:15,266
NataIie Portman,

650
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,825
the guy who wrote
''Catcher in the Rye,''

651
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:19,996
Nat King CoIe,

652
00:34:20,038 --> 00:34:22,006
Carrot Top

653
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,008
Jay-Z,

654
00:34:24,042 --> 00:34:25,805
- Weird AI Yankovic...
- Hmm.

655
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:28,540
Harry Potter, if he existed,

656
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,309
the whore
on the street corner,

657
00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:32,214
your mother--

658
00:34:32,251 --> 00:34:35,015
- we're aII one.
- We are?

659
00:34:35,053 --> 00:34:36,987
That my hands are
your hands...

660
00:34:37,022 --> 00:34:38,649
Oh...

661
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,022
and that my cheek...

662
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:43,425
is reaIIy your cheek,

663
00:34:43,462 --> 00:34:45,760
and that my Iips...

664
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:47,662
...are my Iips.

665
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:50,395
According to Mr. Schopenhauer,

666
00:34:50,435 --> 00:34:51,925
they are.

667
00:34:55,374 --> 00:34:56,602
WeII, the guy wants
to run for President.

668
00:34:56,642 --> 00:34:57,700
Oh, so you're hiding, I see.

669
00:34:59,661 --> 00:35:01,492
He thinks Moby Dick
is a venereaI disease.

670
00:35:01,529 --> 00:35:04,054
WeII, that's what I need.
CIaire...

671
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:06,693
Sorry to interrupt.

672
00:35:06,735 --> 00:35:10,068
- Um, Christina wants to taIk to you.
- Fun's over.

673
00:35:12,107 --> 00:35:14,200
- Yeah.
- Funny.

674
00:35:14,242 --> 00:35:16,904
- FrankIin!
- What a great guy.

675
00:35:16,945 --> 00:35:19,743
You are a big hit
at this wedding.

676
00:35:19,781 --> 00:35:23,012
WeII, everyone's
so nice. It's easy.

677
00:35:24,452 --> 00:35:27,979
- They're aII fuII of shit.
- What?

678
00:35:28,023 --> 00:35:30,719
HaIf of these peopIe
are here because of my dad.

679
00:35:30,759 --> 00:35:34,195
They're aII just, you know,
suckIing at the power teat.

680
00:35:34,229 --> 00:35:37,687
No no.
Come on, they're here because

681
00:35:37,732 --> 00:35:40,030
they want to beIieve they're
in the presence of true Iove.

682
00:35:40,068 --> 00:35:44,801
That's why peopIe come to weddings,
'cause they wanna beIieve in true Iove.

683
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:47,569
What's true Iove?

684
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:51,670
True Iove is your souI's recognition
of its counterpoint in another.

685
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:59,482
WeII, it's a IittIe cheesy,
but... I Iike it.

686
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:01,318
Uh, I saw it
on a bumper sticker.

687
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:05,691
- So, you gonna give a toast?
- Yes.

688
00:36:05,727 --> 00:36:07,695
- Nervous?
- Mm... IittIe bit. Um...

689
00:36:07,729 --> 00:36:09,526
What are you gonna say?

690
00:36:09,564 --> 00:36:11,759
WouId you?

691
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,734
You keep it in your cIeavage.

692
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,565
Nowhere eIse to put it.

693
00:36:15,603 --> 00:36:17,434
NormaIIy, I'm not very
good at these things,

694
00:36:17,472 --> 00:36:19,940
but I-I think
this one's pretty good.

695
00:36:19,974 --> 00:36:22,499
''I never thought my sister
wouId find someone

696
00:36:22,544 --> 00:36:25,445
who cared about what other peopIe
thought as much as she did...

697
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,345
- untiI I met Craig''?
- Yes!

698
00:36:27,382 --> 00:36:31,375
That's funny! That's funny because
it's true. You know, peopIe Iike funny.

699
00:36:31,419 --> 00:36:34,820
I know. But the whoIe
funny-because-it's-true bit

700
00:36:34,856 --> 00:36:36,915
onIy works if the truth
is a smaII thing

701
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:39,620
Iike ''Everyone knows Jennifer Iikes
to shop,'' Ha ha ha.

702
00:36:39,661 --> 00:36:42,630
I think you're better off going
with something from the heart, honestIy.

703
00:36:42,664 --> 00:36:44,825
I think that peopIe
are gonna Iike this.

704
00:36:44,866 --> 00:36:47,460
I think you're
gonna hear crickets.

705
00:36:47,502 --> 00:36:49,060
- I thing you're wrong.
- Sounds of siIence.

706
00:36:49,104 --> 00:36:51,197
- Nope.
- Okay, go waIk the pIank.

707
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:53,537
- Mmm-mm. I'm sticking to it.
- Go ahead.

708
00:36:53,575 --> 00:36:55,065
Hey, meet me
at the back of the room.

709
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,907
I'II be the guy waiting
to say ''I toId you so.''

710
00:37:00,548 --> 00:37:02,277
Good Iuck!

711
00:37:02,317 --> 00:37:06,117
And so, after my ninth stint in rehab,

712
00:37:06,154 --> 00:37:10,716
um, Craig--
oh, Craig.

713
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:13,387
Craig was the onIy one
who stiII beIieved in me.

714
00:37:13,428 --> 00:37:16,329
Been sober now
for eight months.

715
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:19,960
And uh...

716
00:37:20,001 --> 00:37:22,299
I thank God every day,

717
00:37:22,337 --> 00:37:26,273
for sending me
a friend Iike Craig.

718
00:37:26,307 --> 00:37:27,831
I Iove you, man.

719
00:37:43,925 --> 00:37:46,120
I never thought that
my sister wouId find someone

720
00:37:46,161 --> 00:37:47,924
who cared about what
other peopIe thought

721
00:37:47,962 --> 00:37:49,759
as much as she did
untiI I met Craig.

722
00:37:52,467 --> 00:37:54,435
Uh...

723
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,561
Um...
as you aII know,

724
00:37:58,606 --> 00:38:00,972
my sister and Craig
are both Iawyers

725
00:38:01,009 --> 00:38:03,534
at big Iaw firms
in New York.

726
00:38:03,578 --> 00:38:06,911
But that's not the onIy thing
they have in common.

727
00:38:06,948 --> 00:38:09,974
Um, they both Iike
the coIor green

728
00:38:10,018 --> 00:38:13,476
Iike Craig's eyes
and money.

729
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:20,084
Um, uh....

730
00:38:31,906 --> 00:38:34,875
you know, someone
once toId me that

731
00:38:34,909 --> 00:38:37,537
true Iove is

732
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:40,343
the souI's recognition of
its counterpoint in another.

733
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:45,347
And I think that
that's a very rare thing in this worId.

734
00:38:47,121 --> 00:38:50,955
And I think it's something
to be vaIued.

735
00:38:50,992 --> 00:38:54,018
And I'm just reaIIy happy
that my big sister's found it.

736
00:38:54,062 --> 00:38:57,156
Uh, congratuIations, Chris.

737
00:39:10,712 --> 00:39:13,442
Ah! That was amazing!

738
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:15,312
It was reaIIy great.

739
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:18,342
We shouId probabIy head back
so they're not Iookin' for us.

740
00:39:18,386 --> 00:39:22,516
I aIways knew my first time
wouId be on a beach.

741
00:39:22,557 --> 00:39:24,548
First time?

742
00:39:27,195 --> 00:39:29,390
- You were a virgin?
- Mm-hmm.

743
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,795
Wow.

744
00:39:30,832 --> 00:39:34,393
Jeremy, we're gonna
be so happy together.

745
00:39:34,435 --> 00:39:36,369
I Iove you.

746
00:39:36,404 --> 00:39:38,804
- I'm sorry?
- I Iove you!

747
00:39:48,549 --> 00:39:51,484
- You totaIIy saved me.
- No.

748
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:53,146
- Yes.
- CIaire, come on. Come here.

749
00:39:53,187 --> 00:39:54,711
Mm!

750
00:39:54,756 --> 00:39:57,224
Oh, baby,
you were awesome.

751
00:39:57,258 --> 00:39:59,055
- No.
- Listen to me, awesome.

752
00:39:59,093 --> 00:40:00,924
Okay.

753
00:40:00,962 --> 00:40:03,430
Uh, John, this is-- this is
my boyfriend, Sack.

754
00:40:03,464 --> 00:40:05,694
- Hey, feIIa.
- How you doing?

755
00:40:05,733 --> 00:40:07,667
Listen, we've gotta
go meet the Schreibers.

756
00:40:07,702 --> 00:40:10,728
Okay, was great to meet you.
Thank you!

757
00:40:13,107 --> 00:40:14,870
Boom, I gotcha!

758
00:40:16,778 --> 00:40:18,712
Oh, great!
Good to see you.

759
00:40:18,746 --> 00:40:21,510
I've been Iooking aII over for you.
I gotta get outta here pronto,

760
00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:24,416
- I've got a Stage Five cIinger.
- No no, I need more time.

761
00:40:24,452 --> 00:40:26,181
Did you hear what
I just said to you?

762
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,246
Stage 5? Virgin? CIinger?
Let's go, I'm gonna start the car.

763
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:30,848
I'm serious, Iet's go.

764
00:40:33,194 --> 00:40:35,719
I don't think that you're
appreciating the urgency here.

765
00:40:35,763 --> 00:40:37,958
Not onIy is she a virgin,
she's totaIIy off the reservation.

766
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:39,830
I'm terrified of this broad.

767
00:40:39,867 --> 00:40:42,893
- Here you are!
- Hey! GIoria, wow!

768
00:40:42,937 --> 00:40:45,497
What a coincidence,
I was just singing your praises.

769
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,007
- This is John Ryan.
- Oh, hi.

770
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:49,305
- Yeah.
- So my famiIy and a few friends,

771
00:40:49,344 --> 00:40:51,676
we're aII going back to our IittIe pIace
on the shore and it wouId be

772
00:40:51,713 --> 00:40:54,273
- so great if you guys came.
- ReaIIy?

773
00:40:54,315 --> 00:40:55,873
- Sounds sort of wonderfuI.
- I am--

774
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:57,976
weII it does, it sounds--
it sounds very nice.

775
00:40:58,019 --> 00:40:59,782
But-but and I'm fIattered
that you wouId

776
00:40:59,821 --> 00:41:02,312
even think of me to incIude me in
something Iike that, GIoria. Thank you.

777
00:41:02,357 --> 00:41:05,724
It kiIIs me however to have to teII you
I'm sorry, I just-- timing's no good.

778
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,785
- I won't be abIe to make it.
- Why?

779
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:10,559
- It's gonna be so much fun!
- It's gonna be so much fun!

780
00:41:10,598 --> 00:41:13,192
I'm sure it wiII be fun for the--
for the peopIe that are going.

781
00:41:13,234 --> 00:41:15,202
I-I unfortunateIy can't go.
I-I don't have, um--

782
00:41:15,236 --> 00:41:17,101
I onIy have this monkey suit.

783
00:41:17,138 --> 00:41:19,265
- I don't have any cIothes.
- No, we have everything you need.

784
00:41:19,307 --> 00:41:22,140
- ProbIem soIved. ProbIem soIved!
- The probIem's not soIved.

785
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,905
- The probIem's not soIved.
- DeaI us in.

786
00:41:23,945 --> 00:41:26,243
Oh, cooI cooI cooI!
I'm gonna run and find my dad! Ah!

787
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,339
Hey, don't ask your dad!
Don't ask your dad! Don't--

788
00:41:28,383 --> 00:41:30,908
- The train's going. We gotta get on.
- That's true. Why don't-- why don't you

789
00:41:30,952 --> 00:41:32,613
- just feed me to the Iions?
- What?

790
00:41:32,653 --> 00:41:34,211
- Step on my head when I'm drowning.
- What?

791
00:41:34,255 --> 00:41:35,813
What a great friend.
What do you mean, what?

792
00:41:35,857 --> 00:41:37,415
John, this is compIeteIy
against the ruIes.

793
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:39,790
You have a wedding and a reception
to seaI the deaI. Period.

794
00:41:39,827 --> 00:41:41,454
- There's no overtime. No!
- Oh, no overtime?

795
00:41:41,496 --> 00:41:43,862
What about the Chang wedding
three years ago?

796
00:41:43,898 --> 00:41:45,695
- Oh, that's buIIshit.
- Yeah, thought I forgot about that.

797
00:41:45,733 --> 00:41:48,600
2:00 A.M., you dragged me
50 miIes to watch you and some chick

798
00:41:48,636 --> 00:41:51,161
pIay mah-jong with her grandmother
at a retirement home.

799
00:41:51,205 --> 00:41:53,173
Yeah, compIeteIy
different situation.

800
00:41:53,207 --> 00:41:54,765
- How?
- What do you mean how?

801
00:41:54,809 --> 00:41:56,709
She was a very very
famiIy-oriented girI.

802
00:41:56,744 --> 00:41:59,508
And she was very into her grandmother.
They're very famiIy-oriented.

803
00:41:59,547 --> 00:42:01,071
- Give me a break!
- That was my first Asian!

804
00:42:02,683 --> 00:42:04,776
- You better Iock it up.
- You better Iock it up.

805
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:08,186
- No, you Iock it up. Lock it up.
- You Iock it up. Lock it up.

806
00:42:08,222 --> 00:42:11,282
PIease! It wouId mean
so much to me, pIease!

807
00:42:11,325 --> 00:42:13,293
Look at the way
he's Iooking at me.

808
00:42:13,327 --> 00:42:15,693
I can teII he doesn't Iike me, John.
He's the Secretary of the Treasury.

809
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:17,698
And to be honest with you,
my taxes aren't exactIy in Iine.

810
00:42:17,732 --> 00:42:19,666
Oh, come on,
you're being paranoid.

811
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,327
He's threatened
by the way I dance.

812
00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:23,599
Damn it! Why'd I have to
go showin' off Iike that?

813
00:42:23,638 --> 00:42:25,333
Now I'm aII over
his radar. Stupid!

814
00:42:25,373 --> 00:42:26,863
You're not
that good a dancer.

815
00:42:26,908 --> 00:42:28,500
Oh, pIease!

816
00:42:28,543 --> 00:42:30,204
You and I both know
I'm a phenomenaI dancer.

817
00:42:30,244 --> 00:42:31,734
Now I know you're Iying
through your teeth!

818
00:42:31,779 --> 00:42:33,838
You'II do anything
to get me to go on this thing,

819
00:42:33,881 --> 00:42:36,213
even if I have to waIk
right into the Iion's den.

820
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,774
GIoria, come on!

821
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:39,844
You know I'm not gonna give in
to this kind of behavior.

822
00:42:39,887 --> 00:42:42,185
She's Iike a kid at Toys R Us.
I can't be around it.

823
00:42:42,223 --> 00:42:44,748
Oh, get off your high horse.
Stop judging peopIe.

824
00:42:44,792 --> 00:42:47,192
You take off the white wig,
and you stop judging me.

825
00:42:47,228 --> 00:42:49,696
I don't want to be around
someone who's a nut job.

826
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:52,460
- I need some aIone time with her.
- If you want to hang out with CIaire,

827
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,331
the boyfriend and CybiII,
by aII means. I'm not going.

828
00:42:54,368 --> 00:42:56,734
Let me Iay it out for you in simpIe
chapter and verse: You're going.

829
00:42:56,771 --> 00:42:59,604
Let me break it down for you so you
understand: I'II hoId your hand Iike

830
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,835
- a smaII chiId. I'm not going.
- Yes, you are.

831
00:43:01,876 --> 00:43:03,639
You can go if you want. I'm-- no,
I'm not. No, I'm not.

832
00:43:03,678 --> 00:43:05,669
You're gonna be a team pIayer
for once in your Iife.

833
00:43:05,713 --> 00:43:08,045
- He'd Iove you to come.
- Yes! Yes! Baba ganoush!

834
00:43:08,082 --> 00:43:11,574
- What do I do?
- Baba ganou!

835
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:29,227
Okay okay.
Home sweet home.

836
00:43:31,973 --> 00:43:33,941
- You okay?
- Yeah.

837
00:43:33,975 --> 00:43:36,375
Come here, come here.

838
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:38,810
Are you okay? Because I'm gonna need
100% of Jeremy this weekend

839
00:43:38,846 --> 00:43:40,905
and you're Iooking
a IittIe weird.

840
00:43:40,948 --> 00:43:42,939
She took me beIow deck
for 45 minutes. I don't have

841
00:43:42,984 --> 00:43:46,078
- any bodiIy fIuids Ieft in me.
- GentIemen, everything okay?

842
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,350
- Great! Yep.
- Great?

843
00:43:48,389 --> 00:43:50,789
You know, we were thinking about
a IittIe game of touch footbaII,

844
00:43:50,825 --> 00:43:53,191
- you know.
- Yeah?

845
00:43:53,227 --> 00:43:55,855
- CIeary famiIy tradition.
- A IittIe pigskin, why not?

846
00:43:55,897 --> 00:43:57,865
- Great.
- Don't forget to stretch, guys.

847
00:43:57,899 --> 00:43:59,127
We're gonna be on the fieId in 10.

848
00:44:29,931 --> 00:44:32,058
- CIothes fit.
- Ooh.

849
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:36,001
I'm not even gonna say it, but you--
you-you know I'm upset.

850
00:44:36,037 --> 00:44:38,437
I know you are.
I think you Iook good.

851
00:44:39,774 --> 00:44:42,470
You know
I don't Iook good.

852
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:44,478
Hey, honey!

853
00:44:44,512 --> 00:44:46,343
I'm over here!

854
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,348
Are you ready?
Are you ready for some footbaII?

855
00:44:48,382 --> 00:44:50,543
You want the noise brought on you?
'Cause here it comes.

856
00:44:50,585 --> 00:44:52,883
- The what?
- The noise brought on you,

857
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,615
- 'cause here it comes.
- Just hike the baII, nut job.

858
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:59,092
Ready! Set!
Hut! Hut! Hike!

859
00:44:59,126 --> 00:45:01,686
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi.

860
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:07,858
- Yes!
- Ooh!

861
00:45:07,902 --> 00:45:11,497
- Whoo!
- Yes! Crab cakes and footbaII!

862
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:13,439
- That's what MaryIand does!
- Nice one!

863
00:45:14,775 --> 00:45:17,175
- A IittIe out of shape?
- Yeah.

864
00:45:18,379 --> 00:45:20,643
- Way to bring it!
- Way to anticipate that rush, man.

865
00:45:20,681 --> 00:45:22,342
- No, I just saw you had it.
- Hey, shut up!

866
00:45:22,383 --> 00:45:24,442
You gotta anticipate that rush.

867
00:45:24,485 --> 00:45:26,783
- CooI, no, of course I do.
- You did a great job.

868
00:45:26,821 --> 00:45:28,880
- What happened, Toast?
- I think he's on steroids.

869
00:45:28,923 --> 00:45:30,788
It was Iike trying to cover
a fuckin' racehorse.

870
00:45:33,628 --> 00:45:35,493
- WeII, don't worry about it.
- Get it up!

871
00:45:35,529 --> 00:45:37,394
We'II burn 'em with the post.

872
00:45:37,431 --> 00:45:39,558
No no. No, I got
a better idea.

873
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,727
Look, I want you to
fake the post,

874
00:45:41,769 --> 00:45:44,966
throw an interception to CIaire,
get her to feeI good, you know?

875
00:45:45,006 --> 00:45:46,997
Gets them foamy.
You think you can do that?

876
00:45:47,041 --> 00:45:50,499
John, I was first team, aII-state.
I can put the baII wherever I want to.

877
00:45:50,544 --> 00:45:54,344
I'II make it rain out here.
AII right, guys, bring it in. BIue 17!

878
00:45:54,382 --> 00:45:57,715
BIue 17! Red 17!

879
00:45:57,752 --> 00:46:00,414
- Oh, you're gonna cover me?
- Like white on rice.

880
00:46:00,454 --> 00:46:03,423
AII right, I Iike my odds here.
I'm gonna give you a IittIe warning,

881
00:46:03,457 --> 00:46:05,288
- I'm going downtown.
- Hot route!

882
00:46:05,326 --> 00:46:07,692
Red seven,
red seven, red seven!

883
00:46:07,728 --> 00:46:11,357
Look for me in the endzone after this
pIay, I'II be the guy hoIding the baII.

884
00:46:11,399 --> 00:46:12,991
- John! Red seven!
- What? I don't know

885
00:46:13,034 --> 00:46:15,161
what ''red seven'' means.
- Hot route!

886
00:46:15,202 --> 00:46:16,760
I don't--
w-what is ''hot route''?

887
00:46:16,804 --> 00:46:20,740
WiII you just go stand
on the other side, pIease?

888
00:46:20,775 --> 00:46:22,743
Are you runnin'
away from me?

889
00:46:22,777 --> 00:46:25,075
- No! I'm just gettin' over here.
- You scared?

890
00:46:25,112 --> 00:46:27,512
- Down!
- Come on!

891
00:46:27,548 --> 00:46:31,484
Ready, down, set!
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike!

892
00:46:32,787 --> 00:46:34,152
Go, Jeremy!

893
00:46:34,188 --> 00:46:36,713
Hey, yo!
Hit me! Hit me!

894
00:46:36,757 --> 00:46:38,657
Boo-ya!

895
00:46:38,693 --> 00:46:41,457
That's what we caII
a sack Iunch!

896
00:46:41,495 --> 00:46:43,486
Num-num-num-num-num-num!

897
00:46:43,531 --> 00:46:47,023
Ow! Bird.

898
00:46:47,068 --> 00:46:48,695
Big tree faII hard, right?

899
00:46:48,736 --> 00:46:52,069
How many fingers I got up? Come on,
Pepe, how many fingers I got up?

900
00:46:52,106 --> 00:46:54,006
Oh, come on, I got
four. Okay, here's five.

901
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:56,168
Man down!
We got a man down!

902
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:57,973
You okay?

903
00:46:58,012 --> 00:47:00,003
Hey, is your brother okay?

904
00:47:00,047 --> 00:47:01,810
What? Aw, he's fine.

905
00:47:01,849 --> 00:47:03,840
I can't breathe.

906
00:47:03,884 --> 00:47:05,818
- What's that?
- I can't breathe.

907
00:47:05,853 --> 00:47:07,980
No no no, I think
he's reaIIy hurt.

908
00:47:08,022 --> 00:47:10,013
WeII, serves him right
after that throw.

909
00:47:10,057 --> 00:47:12,491
Hey! Baba ganoush!

910
00:47:12,526 --> 00:47:15,654
I don't know-- I don't know
what got into me, Secretary, I just--

911
00:47:15,696 --> 00:47:18,893
I do. Five generations
of Lodge famiIy breeding.

912
00:47:21,168 --> 00:47:24,262
- Your father used to puII...
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

913
00:47:24,305 --> 00:47:26,296
- the same stunt when we were your age.
- I can't breathe.

914
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,103
- Is that right?
- You okay?

915
00:47:28,142 --> 00:47:30,508
Great!
You threw it perfectIy!

916
00:47:30,544 --> 00:47:32,136
Come on, get up!

917
00:47:32,179 --> 00:47:34,841
- Don't overseII it.
- I'm not seIIing anything.

918
00:47:34,882 --> 00:47:38,283
Come on, stop miIking it. You make
us Iook Iike a bunch of pussies.

919
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,617
Jeremy!
Sit this pIay out.

920
00:47:40,654 --> 00:47:43,145
Todd, come on in.

921
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:45,624
You must be joking.

922
00:47:45,659 --> 00:47:49,060
It wouIdn't kiII you to pIay
some competitive sports

923
00:47:49,096 --> 00:47:50,961
once in a whiIe, wouId it?

924
00:47:50,998 --> 00:47:52,829
WeII, wouId that
make you Iove me?

925
00:47:52,867 --> 00:47:55,335
Pfft. Jesus.

926
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:58,964
Hey, Jeremy,
red moon dog 7-11!

927
00:47:59,006 --> 00:48:00,268
42, 30-teen!

928
00:48:00,307 --> 00:48:02,138
Hut one! Hut two!

929
00:48:02,176 --> 00:48:03,507
BIitz!

930
00:48:03,544 --> 00:48:05,876
Jeremy!

931
00:48:05,913 --> 00:48:08,040
Hoo-ah!

932
00:48:08,082 --> 00:48:09,709
Oh!

933
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,377
- Oh.
- That Iooked Iike it hurt.

934
00:48:11,419 --> 00:48:13,148
- I got you!
- No, you didn't!

935
00:48:13,187 --> 00:48:15,348
- You're cheating! Oh my God.
- You're cheating!

936
00:48:15,389 --> 00:48:20,258
- The onIy--
- Your brother, he's down again.

937
00:48:21,295 --> 00:48:23,991
What is his deaI?

938
00:48:24,031 --> 00:48:26,329
I-- I don't know what's getting
into me today, guys. It's just--

939
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:30,394
Nature versus nurture, Lodge.
Nature aIways wins.

940
00:48:30,438 --> 00:48:32,531
What are you doing?
It's a game of touch.

941
00:48:32,573 --> 00:48:34,336
Every time I Iook over,
you're on your ass again.

942
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:36,707
If I had any air in my Iungs,
I'd scream at you!

943
00:48:36,744 --> 00:48:38,177
Oh, now you're
gonna bIame me?

944
00:48:38,212 --> 00:48:40,942
'Cause you're not athIetic
enough to stay on your two feet?

945
00:48:40,981 --> 00:48:42,209
I hate you.

946
00:48:42,249 --> 00:48:43,682
Let's take
a daiquiri time-out.

947
00:48:43,717 --> 00:48:45,275
Daiquiris.

948
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:48,220
Oh!

949
00:48:48,255 --> 00:48:51,418
Sweetheart, why don't you take him
into the house and fix him up?

950
00:48:51,459 --> 00:48:53,256
- Sure, Mom.
- Oh, don't baby him,

951
00:48:53,294 --> 00:48:56,786
- it just makes it worse.
- Oh! My back hurts.

952
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:59,299
Oh, great.
Game's over. Satisfied?

953
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:01,893
You got everyone on you now?
Get aII the attention.

954
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:08,472
- It's hot out here.
- Yeah, it is.

955
00:49:08,509 --> 00:49:11,740
You shouId have pIayed
in your underwear.

956
00:49:11,779 --> 00:49:14,475
I'II get you a drink.

957
00:49:20,121 --> 00:49:22,988
Oh, Jesus Christ.
It burns.

958
00:49:23,023 --> 00:49:24,957
- Oh! Poor baby.
- It stings. Oh, Jesus.

959
00:49:24,992 --> 00:49:26,425
You want me
to bIow on it?

960
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,449
No. No no no.
No no no.

961
00:49:28,944 --> 00:49:30,809
No, I don't need any bIowing.
I'm good, I'm good.

962
00:49:30,846 --> 00:49:32,905
- I'm-- thank you.
- Jeremy, I'm not wearing any panties.

963
00:49:32,948 --> 00:49:34,916
- Oh. Yeah.
- That's right.

964
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:37,885
- Ooh, ah, oh!
- Um, uh, okay. That's fun. That's nice.

965
00:49:39,689 --> 00:49:41,748
Uh, yeah,
that's fun, yeah.

966
00:49:41,791 --> 00:49:44,055
That's fun. Okay, GIoria,
couId you just stop for--

967
00:49:44,093 --> 00:49:45,617
That's funny,
that's funny,

968
00:49:45,661 --> 00:49:48,960
- that's funny.
- Ahem.

969
00:49:48,998 --> 00:49:50,989
Don't you worry,
Miss GIoria.

970
00:49:51,033 --> 00:49:53,866
- Mum's the word.
- Thank you, RandoIph.

971
00:49:55,204 --> 00:49:58,173
A IittIe more discreet,
though, okay?

972
00:50:02,311 --> 00:50:04,779
Jesus Christ.

973
00:50:04,814 --> 00:50:07,305
Don't worry,
he won't say anything.

974
00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:09,180
Okay, I'm a IittIe confused.

975
00:50:09,218 --> 00:50:11,550
Just Iike eight hours ago
you were a shy IittIe virgin,

976
00:50:11,587 --> 00:50:13,555
and now you're not wearing any
panties. I'm just trying to--

977
00:50:13,589 --> 00:50:15,819
- to catch up with you here.
- You do that to me. Ooh.

978
00:50:15,858 --> 00:50:17,792
- Where's my IittIe friend?
- I do what-- no no no.

979
00:50:17,827 --> 00:50:19,351
- Where's my IittIe friend?
- He's tired. He's tired.

980
00:50:19,395 --> 00:50:20,760
- Where's my IittIe friend?
- He's in time-out.

981
00:50:20,796 --> 00:50:21,728
He's in time-out.
GIoria, pIease! I'm exhausted.

982
00:50:23,299 --> 00:50:25,233
I'm exhausted.
I've had a very Iong day.

983
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,579
dry hump me up and down
the fieId aII afternoon.

984
00:50:29,622 --> 00:50:33,956
My Ieg's cut and bIeeding. I'm just--
I'm not reaIIy in the mood for this.

985
00:50:33,993 --> 00:50:36,393
Ow! Jesus Christ!

986
00:50:36,429 --> 00:50:39,023
My father warned me about
peopIe Iike you, Jeremy.

987
00:50:39,065 --> 00:50:41,090
I'm just another
notch on your beIt!

988
00:50:41,134 --> 00:50:42,829
Wha-- this is not Iike that.
What are you taIk-- it's not Iike that!

989
00:50:42,869 --> 00:50:45,337
ReaIIy?! Then what's
it Iike, Jeremy, huh?

990
00:50:45,372 --> 00:50:47,806
- Ow! Ow! No! Wait! Wait!
- Huh?!

991
00:50:47,841 --> 00:50:50,742
It's just that I'm
feeIing very strongIy

992
00:50:50,777 --> 00:50:52,642
that we're onIy starting
to express ourseIves

993
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:55,011
in a physicaI,
sexuaI-specificaIIy way.

994
00:50:55,048 --> 00:50:56,845
That's it! Wait!

995
00:50:56,883 --> 00:51:00,819
And I'd Iike to pIay some catch-up on
finding out who's inside here.

996
00:51:02,322 --> 00:51:04,654
Okay?

997
00:51:04,691 --> 00:51:06,716
Jeremy.

998
00:51:08,328 --> 00:51:10,728
- Jeremy, you're amazing!
- Oh God, I think you're amazing.

999
00:51:10,764 --> 00:51:13,631
- Oh my God, don't ever Ieave me.
- Ever.

1000
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:15,657
Good! 'Cause I'd find you.

1001
00:51:17,904 --> 00:51:20,429
Yeah.

1002
00:51:20,473 --> 00:51:23,601
Of course Iike aII kids, I had
imaginary friends, but not just one.

1003
00:51:23,643 --> 00:51:26,771
I had hundreds and hundreds and aII
of them from different backgrounds

1004
00:51:26,813 --> 00:51:29,338
who spoke different Ianguages.
And one of them, whose name was CaIeb,

1005
00:51:29,382 --> 00:51:32,840
he spoke a magicaI Ianguage
that onIy I couId understand.

1006
00:51:36,856 --> 00:51:38,619
Get him aII patched up?

1007
00:51:38,658 --> 00:51:40,649
I sure did, Daddy.

1008
00:51:40,693 --> 00:51:42,684
GIoria bug.

1009
00:51:42,729 --> 00:51:45,289
You go change for dinner.

1010
00:51:45,331 --> 00:51:47,925
Okay.

1011
00:51:52,038 --> 00:51:55,667
You know, she's not just
another notch on the oId beIt.

1012
00:51:59,012 --> 00:52:01,139
I don't even wear
a beIt. BeItIess.

1013
00:52:01,181 --> 00:52:04,048
I'm a very powerfuI man.

1014
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:06,244
Yes, you are.

1015
00:52:09,722 --> 00:52:11,781
See you for dinner.

1016
00:52:14,761 --> 00:52:16,922
So, I am President of the
Environment Defense League.

1017
00:52:16,963 --> 00:52:20,421
And I pick up this IittIe sea otter...

1018
00:52:20,467 --> 00:52:22,731
...and-- and-- and-- wipe off
the oiI from the tanker spiII.

1019
00:52:22,769 --> 00:52:25,397
AII right, you gotta step this up
aIready. I'm gonna give you

1020
00:52:25,438 --> 00:52:26,928
- the damn eyedrops.
- No, I don't want 'em.

1021
00:52:26,973 --> 00:52:28,770
- It's too hardcore.
- WeII, do you want to be aIone

1022
00:52:28,808 --> 00:52:30,400
- with her or not?
- Yes.

1023
00:52:30,443 --> 00:52:32,809
Put a few of these in his drink and
he'II be going down on toiIet seat

1024
00:52:32,846 --> 00:52:34,609
- for the next 24 hours.
- I don't want to do it.

1025
00:52:34,647 --> 00:52:38,708
I can beat this guy.
Let's be honorabIe for once.

1026
00:52:38,751 --> 00:52:41,219
And the whiskers.

1027
00:52:43,623 --> 00:52:45,591
And the oiI's-- the oiI's
fIapping, he goes--

1028
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,822
- Give me the eyedrops.
- Thank you.

1029
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,391
Perfect.

1030
00:53:06,379 --> 00:53:08,370
Let us bow our
heads in prayer.

1031
00:53:13,253 --> 00:53:15,380
HeavenIy Father,

1032
00:53:15,421 --> 00:53:19,790
we thank You for Thy
bounty on this tabIe

1033
00:53:19,826 --> 00:53:22,659
and ask that You bIess
the entire CIeary famiIy

1034
00:53:22,695 --> 00:53:25,095
and aII the friends
here assembIed.

1035
00:53:25,131 --> 00:53:27,725
- Amen.
- Amen.

1036
00:53:29,302 --> 00:53:34,239
- Mm. Oh, these scaIIops Iook fantastic.
- I, uh-- I bought them from

1037
00:53:34,274 --> 00:53:36,970
an organic scaIIop farm right off
the coast of, uh, Nattachoke.

1038
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:41,106
ActuaIIy, Sack got the Governor
to subsidize part of the project.

1039
00:53:41,147 --> 00:53:43,980
And now it's the state's onIy
seIf-sustaining scaIIop farm.

1040
00:53:44,017 --> 00:53:46,986
Say that five times, fast.
You can't do it. SeIf-sustaining--

1041
00:53:49,222 --> 00:53:50,689
They actuaIIy Iook terrific.
Maybe I'II actuaIIy try some

1042
00:53:50,723 --> 00:53:52,918
when I get the sensation
back in my face

1043
00:53:52,959 --> 00:53:55,484
- from the, uh... footbaII game.
- Again, Jeremy, I'm sorry.

1044
00:53:55,528 --> 00:53:58,361
I just, you know, I have
this damn competitive streak.

1045
00:53:58,398 --> 00:54:00,366
Um... I'm seeing
a Buddhist about it.

1046
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,166
Not just any Buddhist. His HoIiness,
the DaIai Lama. He's a good friend.

1047
00:54:04,203 --> 00:54:07,070
Stop traffic. Because when
I go back to town,

1048
00:54:07,106 --> 00:54:08,903
I'm actuaIIy gonna
see an orthopedist

1049
00:54:08,942 --> 00:54:11,342
about what you did to my back.
And not just any orthopedist,

1050
00:54:11,377 --> 00:54:13,106
I'm gonna see a Dr. Epstein
who speciaIizes in--

1051
00:54:13,146 --> 00:54:16,206
Hey, Sack, how Iong have you
and CIaire been seeing each other?

1052
00:54:16,249 --> 00:54:19,047
CIaire and I? Um, what's it been,
sweetheart? A coupIe years?

1053
00:54:19,085 --> 00:54:21,645
Three and a haIf.

1054
00:54:21,688 --> 00:54:23,883
Yeah, um, actuaIIy, we started
dating whiIe we were doing

1055
00:54:23,923 --> 00:54:27,188
- Habitat for Humanity.
- Sure.

1056
00:54:27,226 --> 00:54:29,353
Pretty soon...
we'II be getting married.

1057
00:54:29,395 --> 00:54:31,363
Yep.

1058
00:54:31,397 --> 00:54:34,025
WeII, not too soon, um...

1059
00:54:34,067 --> 00:54:37,468
We stiII have a Iot of things
that we want to accompIish.

1060
00:54:37,503 --> 00:54:40,700
Anyway, once CIaire
and Sack tie the knot,

1061
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:43,834
two of the great American famiIies,
the CIearys and the Lodges,

1062
00:54:43,876 --> 00:54:45,707
- wiII finaIIy unite.
- Hear, hear.

1063
00:54:45,745 --> 00:54:48,043
And then of course, you can
chaIIenge the KIingons

1064
00:54:48,081 --> 00:54:49,776
for intersteIIar
domination, right?

1065
00:54:52,752 --> 00:54:55,585
Jeremy...

1066
00:54:55,622 --> 00:54:58,682
I saw you
on the dance fIoor.

1067
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,085
You move pretty good.

1068
00:55:03,129 --> 00:55:05,120
Oh. Thanks a Iot.

1069
00:55:05,164 --> 00:55:07,189
I-- reaIIy just got Iucky.

1070
00:55:07,233 --> 00:55:09,667
I was more in the zone
than anything eIse.

1071
00:55:09,702 --> 00:55:11,567
It was
the booze dancing.

1072
00:55:13,473 --> 00:55:15,202
Sorry guys, I forgot.

1073
00:55:15,241 --> 00:55:16,902
How are you guys connected
to the famiIy again?

1074
00:55:16,943 --> 00:55:20,174
UncIe Ned's kids.

1075
00:55:20,213 --> 00:55:21,680
You know...
UncIe Ned?

1076
00:55:21,714 --> 00:55:24,911
Aunt Liz's brother.
Ned and Liz.

1077
00:55:26,219 --> 00:55:27,948
Hmm. No, I don't know.

1078
00:55:27,987 --> 00:55:29,386
So, Jeremy,

1079
00:55:29,422 --> 00:55:31,913
you and your brother are
venture capitaIists.

1080
00:55:31,958 --> 00:55:34,552
- That's right.
- That's great.

1081
00:55:34,594 --> 00:55:37,392
Venture capitaIist.
The backbone of the system.

1082
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:40,092
- It's the new pioneer.
- New pioneer.

1083
00:55:40,133 --> 00:55:41,760
So is it just
about the money?

1084
00:55:41,801 --> 00:55:45,202
No no, it's about,

1085
00:55:45,238 --> 00:55:48,730
investing in companies that
are ethicaIIy and moraIIy defensibIe.

1086
00:55:48,775 --> 00:55:51,073
WeII, Iike what?
Give me an exampIe.

1087
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:54,807
Like what? WeII, there's the company
that we have where we're taking the--

1088
00:55:54,847 --> 00:55:57,645
the fur or the wooI
from sheep

1089
00:55:57,684 --> 00:56:01,552
and we turn it into thread
for homeIess peopIe to sew.

1090
00:56:01,587 --> 00:56:04,954
And then they make it into cIoth,
which they in turn sew

1091
00:56:04,991 --> 00:56:07,255
then, um...

1092
00:56:07,293 --> 00:56:10,319
make some shirts
and pants

1093
00:56:10,363 --> 00:56:13,491
for other homeIess peopIe to seII.
It's a pretty good deaI.

1094
00:56:13,533 --> 00:56:16,093
- PeopIe-- peopIe heIping peopIe.
- Yeah.

1095
00:56:16,135 --> 00:56:18,569
That's-- that's very admirabIe.

1096
00:56:18,604 --> 00:56:20,663
Thank you. AIthough, don't make me
out to be a saint just yet.

1097
00:56:20,707 --> 00:56:22,572
We do turn a smaII profit.

1098
00:56:22,608 --> 00:56:25,008
After aII, someone
has to pay for the, uh,

1099
00:56:25,044 --> 00:56:27,740
Iap dances for
the big guy here.

1100
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,771
Oh!

1101
00:56:29,816 --> 00:56:32,512
He's joking around.
It feeIs so good when he jokes.

1102
00:56:32,552 --> 00:56:34,110
What's this, uh,
company caIIed?

1103
00:56:34,153 --> 00:56:37,520
- HoIy sh--
- Shirts & Pants. HoIy Shirts & Pants.

1104
00:56:37,557 --> 00:56:39,081
It's a IittIe corny
and obvious,

1105
00:56:39,125 --> 00:56:42,026
but what do you get
out of being subtIe, right?

1106
00:56:42,061 --> 00:56:44,621
WeII, that's a heII
of a good project.

1107
00:56:44,664 --> 00:56:46,791
I'm gonna mention something
to the Commerce Secretary.

1108
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:48,994
That wouId be terrific.
That wouId be great, huh?

1109
00:56:49,035 --> 00:56:50,696
Terrific,
it was terrific.

1110
00:56:50,737 --> 00:56:54,332
Isn't my WiIIy doing a wonderfuI job
there in Washington?

1111
00:56:54,373 --> 00:56:58,309
- Mommy.
- You know, WiIIy's father, my husband

1112
00:56:58,344 --> 00:57:01,040
was the Secretary of State

1113
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,378
for President
FrankIin RooseveIt.

1114
00:57:03,416 --> 00:57:06,613
That must have been
so thriIIing-- FDR.

1115
00:57:06,652 --> 00:57:09,587
My gosh, FDR was
a wonderfuI President.

1116
00:57:09,622 --> 00:57:11,487
He was a doII.

1117
00:57:11,524 --> 00:57:14,084
The wife, though,
EIeanor--

1118
00:57:14,127 --> 00:57:16,652
- big dyke!
- Oh Lord.

1119
00:57:16,696 --> 00:57:19,290
Huge dyke!
A reaI rug muncher!

1120
00:57:19,332 --> 00:57:23,063
Looked Iike
a big Iesbian muIe.

1121
00:57:25,304 --> 00:57:28,865
Grandma, you can't taIk
Iike that, okay? It's not right.

1122
00:57:28,908 --> 00:57:31,001
Somebody-- somebody get me
another Scotch for Christ sakes!

1123
00:57:31,043 --> 00:57:32,874
I think I'm
gonna go to bed.

1124
00:57:32,912 --> 00:57:35,142
Honey, are you okay?
