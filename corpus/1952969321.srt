1
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,212
My town is probably
a lot like yours.

2
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:09,344
You know, plenty of manicured
lawns and Volvos on the outside.

3
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:12,652
And some very special friends
on the inside.

4
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:16,626
Not to mention the never-ending
search for enlightenment.

5
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,596
Businessmen begging
for their promotions.

6
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:21,325
I-- I'd kill for it.

7
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,061
Whoo! Yeah!

8
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,000
While the jocks
and cool kids

9
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:27,402
look after
those less popular.

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,497
It can be quite touching.

11
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:32,202
Or not... depending on
your perspective.

12
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:35,178
I mean, everyone has
their breaking point, right?

13
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:39,081
Meet mine.

14
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,312
No, I don't think
we're dysfunctional.

15
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,012
You don't?

16
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,953
I mean,
we have our quirks,

17
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:48,288
but what family doesn't?

18
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,225
Your family, Mr. Burnett--

19
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:53,093
Jack-- Why don't you call me
Jack, Rachel?

20
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,291
Oh.

21
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,197
You can't call her Rachel.

22
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,667
- Why not?
- Because she's our therapist.

23
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,203
Here we go.

24
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,000
It's fine.
You can call me Rachel.

25
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,940
Absolutely not.

26
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,034
You deserve respect.

27
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,306
Call her "Doctor."

28
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,972
- She's not a doctor.
- What?

29
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,913
- How do you know that?
- Googled her.

30
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:16,450
You're not a doctor?

31
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,614
Well, I have my master's,
but not my PhD.

32
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:20,658
No PhD?

33
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:23,626
- That's just great.
- What does it matter?

34
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,185
We're supposed to tell her
every intimate detail

35
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,321
about our family life.

36
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,332
Yeah, like how
fucked up we are.

37
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,163
- Kelly--
- She comes highly recommended.

38
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:31,600
I assure you
I'm very qualified.

39
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,638
Might as well be talking
to the plumber.

40
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,138
Why are we even here?

41
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,640
Because your father said

42
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,107
we were on the verge
of a nervous breakdown.

43
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:41,270
- I did not say that.
- Yes, you did!

44
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,371
Actually, it was
an "emotional breakdown"--

45
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,940
- Shut it.
- Shut up.

46
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,917
I bet we're the first
family to ever be fired

47
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,318

Yeah, good.

81
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,048
Yeah, come on.

00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:12,154
Good.

83
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,459
Yeah.

84
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,658
Shit!

85
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,071
Not a chance, Jack.

86
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,418
( click }

87
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,312
Nice job.

88
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,195
Damn it.

89
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:52,313
But, mother, I think we
should have the AIDS triathlon

90
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:55,450
at least two weeks after
Bicycling for Breast Cancer.

91
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,495
Be-- no-- but--

92
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,552
Because everyone's
gonna be exhausted.

93
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,156
- Cut your ear again, Dad?
- Very observant.

94
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:05,395
Grandma's not really coming to
live with us, is she?

95
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,563
- No.
- Uh, yes, she is.

96
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,005
No, I'm back.

97
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:13,009
Right, what about a marathon
for manic depression?

98
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,511
Or, uh,
sculling for scoliosis.

99
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,309
Shut up, Jack.

100
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,873
Rollerblading
for rectal itch?

101
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,145
Luging for lumbago?

102
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,051
Yes, I know that
they're rude.

103
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,454
Good, mm-hmm.

104
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,458
Well, I just can't
wait to see you.

105
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,655
Leave this under
my pillow again,

106
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,323
and I'll shove it
up your ass.

107
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,992
I'm just trying to help.

108
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,036
I don't need
your fucking help.

109
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,298
Don't talk to
your brother that way.

110
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,670
Is that my blouse?

111
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,009
Yeah, you gave it to me,
remember?

112
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,346
Uh, I think it shows a little
too much nipple.

113
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,113
Bunnie.

114
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,085
Well, if you want
every boy in school

115
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,554
thinking you're
a little slut...

116
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,217
- which you may be.
- Fine.

117
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,155
- Oh, my God.
- Kelly--

118
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,392
There's your blouse back.

119
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,935
She's definitely
a little slut.

120
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,381
I hate school.

121
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,646
I hate it almost as much
as I hate that old bitch.

122
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,483
That's no way to talk
about your mother.

123
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,454
I was talking
about Grandma.

124
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,423
Oh, well, that's no way
to talk about her, either.

125
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,357
Oh, please, you hate her
almost as much as I do.

126
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:37,485
I don't hate her.

127
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,052
You hate her almost
as much as--

128
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:40,961
I do not hate anybody.

129
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,590
God said, "Honor your
father and your mother--"

130
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,066
- Shut up, Eric.
- Please shut up.

131
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:45,625
I'm driving.

132
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,075
Honor thy father--
get in the back.

133
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,877
Wait, um...
what is this for?

134
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,782
Oh... oh, God.

135
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:06,153
Well, maybe it ought to be
200 a plate, then.

136
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,886
What'?!

137
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,155
Pancreatic cancer
kills that many?

138
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,992
That's great!

139
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,828
No, let me get right on it.

140
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,028
Yeah, okay,
I'll call you later.

141
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,002
What?

142
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,904
Ha! You're so bad.

143
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,965
Okay, bye.

144
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,611
Reminder to self--
call Grace,

145
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,274
check pancreatic cancer
death rate.

146
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:35,012
If accurate,
up per-plate fee.

147
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,087
Aah!

148
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,788
Aah! Aah!

149
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,160
Come here!

150
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,234
Aah!

151
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,816
- Oh, shit.
- What?

152
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,322
That doorknob
was made in Italy.

153
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,983
Oh.

154
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,685
I'm sorry.

155
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,751
I mean, the window
I can fix.

156
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,764
But the doorknob...

157
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,692
it's irreplaceable.

158
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,794
Oh, I'm--

159
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:29,066
Babe, I just--
I don't know.

160
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,200
I was just so... into it.

161
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,699

Huh?

167

Your ear is bleeding.

168
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,948
Oh.

169
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,897
Nina.

170
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,837
Is that the best
you can do?

171
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,898

Oh, this is gonna
be fun, Jack.

173

174
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,144
You mean, we're--

175
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,947
Firing people together.

176
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,351
Um...

177
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,946
Yeah.

00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,254
Nina? She's back?

180
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,095
I hired her yesterday.

181
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,631
The company's
hemorrhaging money, Jack.

182
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,694
You and Nina will stem
the flow of blood.

183
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,140
You'll get your raise,

184
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,940
your own Secretary.

185
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,313
You're the best boss ever,
Mr. Burnett.

186
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,082
Of course,
a position like this

187
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:28,284
comes with a certain amount
of responsibility, Jack!

188
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:31,021
You can definitely
count on me, Harv.

189
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,791
Your first priority
will be cutting costs.

190
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:34,991
Fantastic.

191
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,897
Yeah! Ohh!

192
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,129
Good, yeah.

193
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,761
- Yeah!
- Ohh!

194
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,669
Oh, I like that.

195
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,674
- Stop!
- Oh! Mmm.

196
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,040
- Hammer time.
- Ohh.

197
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,271
Yeah.

198
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,779
Oh! Oh!

199
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,315
- Watch your head, baby.
- Ohh! ohh!

200
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,078
Ohh! Yeah!

201
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,619
Ooh! Yeah!

202
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,711
- Let's ring the bell, baby.
- No.

203
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,688
No, no, ring my bell.

204
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,055
- Ring the bell, baby.
- Don't ring the bell.

205
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,684
Ohh! Ohh!

206
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:06,093
Ding! Whoo!

207
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,324
Ding!

208
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,627
Oh!

209
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,224
Oh, shit.

210
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,867
Bunnie?

211
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,770
Bunnie?

212
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,845
You rushed it.

213
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,321
Sorry, Reverend.

214
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,657
Everything all right?

215
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,857
You know those guys I told you
about-- Andy and Roy?

216
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:45,027
Andy Porter--
religious club.

217
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,763
I joined.

218
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,772
Excellent.

219
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,843
Shit.

220
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,622
Hey, Jack...

221
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,057
- How is she?
- She's, um--

222
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,094
I don't know.

223
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,565
Cops said someone
broke into the house.

224
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,600
She might've been raped,
for God's sake.

225
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,161
Raped?

226
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:25,571
Is she conscious?

227
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,110
Mr. Burnett?

228
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:31,342
Oh, Doctor.

229
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,781
- We've had some complications.
- Oh, complications.

230
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,614
She's confused,
short-term memory loss.

231
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,711
- Confused, short-term...
- Yes.

232
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,153
Short-term memory loss?

233
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,815
Yes, quite a mess,
actually.

234
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,855
Bunnie?

235
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,191
Jack?

236
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,998
You remember me.

237
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,267
Oh, of course I remember you,
snookie-pie.

238
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,938
You haven't called me
that in awhile.

239
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,536
I haven't'?

240
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,143
Mmm.

241
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,217
Mmm.

242
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,555
What?

243
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,152
Nothing.

244
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,293
Do you feel up to
seeing Eric and Kelly?

245
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:28,099
Sure.

246
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,733
Who are Eric and Kelly?

247
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,608
She doesn't
remember either of us?

248
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,909
She only remembers up until
we first got married.

249
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,041
Shouldn't we go in there
and at least see her?

250
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,745
What's the point if she doesn't
even know who we are?

251
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,118
Maybe you guys
should just let her rest.

252
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,747
Yeah, Simon's right.

253
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,190
That's probably the best thing
for her now.

254
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:52,058
I wonder if she
can bake again.

255
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,119
Well, you always said

256
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,063
how good her
fudge brownies used to be.

257
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,030
If she decides
to whip up a batch,

258
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,539
send them over
to the church.

259
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,776
You guys were out shooting
again, weren't you?

260
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,543
Your boy has a God-given
talent, Mr. Burnett.

261
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,710
- What, killing and maiming?
- Dad--

262
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,720
Eric, you're weird
enough as it is

263
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,655
without being some kind of
gun nut to top it off.

264
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,920
- Dad, hey.
- Josh, what are you doing here?

265
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,586
How's Mrs. Burnett?

266
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,220
She's got amnesia.

267
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,731
- Amnesia.
- That's the good news.

268
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,789
Short-term memory loss.

269
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,665
She should probably
get it back soon.

270
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,671
And that's the bad news.

271
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,263
Kelly, you know what?
I've just about had it.

272
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,899
I'm fed up to here-- I only
wanted to be fed up to here.

273
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,739
What's the problem, Dad?

274
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,779
Simon, do you mind
taking the kids home?

275
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,213
- Seriously.
- I can do it.

276
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,341
Great, why don't you pick off
a couple of deer on your way?

277
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,313
- I'll take them.
- Thanks, Josh.

278
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,015
Come on.

279
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,426
Your son's very talented,
Mr. Burnett.

280
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,594
Yeah.

281
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,796
You should come out
and watch him sometime.

282
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,802
I'll pray for your wife.

283
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,673
You do that.

284
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,146
Gun-toting nut job.

285
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,841
I really gotta thank you
for coming out.

286
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:24,945
I can't tell you
how much it means to me.

287
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,616
Oh, hey, man,
it's the least I could do.

288
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,989
- It's amazing, right?
- What's that?

289
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,790
In a world full of
racial bullshit,

290
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,761
here's a black man
and a white man,

291
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,095
and, uh, we've just
risen above all this crap

292
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,157
to actually be able to
call each other "brother."

293
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,703
Uh, you know,
I don't mean "brutha,“

294
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,602
like maybe one of those
ghetto black guys.

295
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,732
I can say "black guy" to you,
I don't have to say--

296
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,777
I understand,
I know what you mean.

297
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,869
Yeah, you know-- sorry.

298
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,607
- Ah, hell.
- it's all right.

299
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,250
I love you, buddy,
really, l-- really.

300
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:57,014
Um, I was gonna get a cup of
joe, if you want to join me.

301
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,749
You know what?
I need to get home.

302
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,085
- Oh, all right.
- Yeah, yeah.

303
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,954
Well, I--

304
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,290
I love you, buddy,
I do, yeah.

305
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,556
Couldn't ask for
a better neighbor.

306
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,063
- All right.
- All right.

307
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,861
Right on, I'll holler
at you later, then...

308
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,629
My man.

309
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:18,775
Paging Dr. Bender,
paging Dr. Bender, please.

310
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,259
Hi, Bunnie.

311
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,885
How are you feeling?

312
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,658
Good.

313
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,562
How are you?

314
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,895
Me? I'm-- I'm fine.

315
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,270
It's nice
to see you again.

316
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:54,001
You don't have any idea
who I am, do you?

317
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,773
Mm-mm.

318
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,677
Hold on.

319
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,445
What about now?

320
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,715
Not a clue, sorry.

321
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,915
No, no, don't be sorry.

322
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,720
Just, um--

323
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,889
- You get some rest.
- Mmm.

324
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,636
Just great.

325
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,251
License and registration.

326
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,449
Here you go.

327
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,753
You know your car
registration's expired?

328
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,815
No.

329
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,862
Is this vehicle yours, sir?

330
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,228
No, I stole it.

331
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,494
- Step out, please.
- Oh, come on, that was--

332
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,627
Sir, I need you to
step out of the car.

333
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,896
- Ohh!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

334
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,374
- Freeze! Right there!
- Hey, take it easy!

335
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:00,808
What are you doing?

336
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,609
- He looks black.
- Right.

337
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,852
- He stank black.
- Right.

338
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,253
Okay.

339
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,655
Yeah.

340
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,590
Motherfucker
tastes black.

341
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,958
Is he delicious, cuz?

342
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,793
Don't ask me
no shit like that!

343
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,526
We should cut this
motherfucker open

344
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,330
and see if he's black
through and through.

345
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,700
I say you cut
this motherfucker--

346
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,739
Whoa, he just woke up.

347
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,537
Wake up.

348
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,412
What's up... my brother?

349
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,414
You ain't
my brother, cuz.

350
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,881
Right, sorry.

351
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,383
What the fuck
you in here for, huh?

352
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,283
I really don't know.

353
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:46,380
Where the hell was you at
when they picked you up?

354
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,015
I was in my car.

355
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,718
His car, shh.

356
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,455
Okay, shit, what kind of
car you drive, huh?

357
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,326
Um, I drive a Jag.

358
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,798
- Oh, Jag!
- Oh, big shit.

359
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:59,699
But you don't know why you in
here, though, huh?

360
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,635
Simon Krebs.

361
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,001
Yeah, that's me.

362
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:04,938
- You made bail.
- Deepak...

363
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,273
- Later, guys.
- Search this motherfucker!

364
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,312
What's in your
pockets, nigga?

365
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,541
Shit, what kind of fuckin' name
is Simon Krebs?

366
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,674
What kind of name
is that for a black man?

367
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,047
I don't know, but I know crabs
are supposed to

368
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,916
make your dick itch
or something.

369
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,859
Do you really buy that
some guy busted in here

370
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,791
and attacked Mom?

371
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,831
Uh... why else would
the window be broken?

372
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,797
Give me some.

373
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:38,034
That was, uh, nice of Josh
to show up like that.

374
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,702
Um, yeah, I guess.

375
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:48,009
- Do you think Mom blows Dad?
- What?!

376
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,576
Maybe if she did, they wouldn't
be getting a divorce.

377
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,588
They're not
getting a divorce.

378
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,385
Sure they are.

379
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:57,484
But maybe a little oral sex
would spice up--

380
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:58,994
Shut up!
You're disgusting.

381
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,997
What, there's nothing
wrong with it.

382
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,691
Yes, there is.

383
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:05,928
They talk about it
on TV all the time.

384
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,995
The Bible forbids it.

385
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,234
Yeah?

386
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:13,902
Tell me, where does it say
“no blow jobs"

387
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,740
in the Bible, Eric?

388
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:18,714
I couldn't tell you,
I don't know the exact--

389
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,750
But I know it's in there.

390
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:24,413
What do you think
the word is on rim jobs?

391
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,752
Jesus Christ, Kelly!
Why do you do this?

392
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,450
What, what do I do?

393
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,790
You say stuff just to
piss people off, why?

394
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,488
Because when people
are mad,

395
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,828
it shows you
who they really are.

396
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,366
- Really?
- Yeah.

397
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:38,696
Okay, then who am I?

398
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:43,471
You're a Bible-thumping
hypocrite

399
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,634
who really doesn't know shit
about the Scriptures.

400
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:47,938
Fuck you.

401
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,612
Heh.

402
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,980
That's the first real thing
you've said to me in months.

403
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:19,832
She was pretty.

404
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,571
She's still pretty.

405
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:40,826
I got a promotion today.

406
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:44,695
Really?

407
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:48,803
That's good.

408
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,881
You guys really look like you
used to be in love back then.

409
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,682
Yeah.

410
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,551
Yeah.

411
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,667
Why do you think
she hates me so much?

412
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:27,741
She doesn't hate you.

413
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:36,746
You think she's
gonna be okay?

414
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,257
Don't know.

415
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,755
I hope so.

416
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:50,896
Is Eric upstairs?

417
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:54,996
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

418
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:01,300
You know, you probably shouldn't
have called him a weirdo.

419
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,852
Yeah, heh.

420
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,650
Even though he is.

421
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,915
Ah, what the hell
are you doing?

422
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,289
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

423
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:52,919
You call pointing a gun
at somebody "nothing"?

424
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,294
- Give me the gun.
- it's not even loaded.

425
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:56,957
Goddamn it, Eric,
give me the gun!

426
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,792
If anyone's
seen Bobby Overmeir,

427
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,831
will they please report
to the principal's office.

428
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:32,698
You need some help?

429
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,600
Um...

430
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,297
Yeah, sure, yeah.

431
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,999
They can be
kind of tricky.

432
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:40,236
Yeah, uh--

433
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:44,246
- it's, um, 15-1-36.
- I know--

434
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:45,940
I know it already.

435
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:49,577
My locker's here,
so, I mean, I've seen it.

436
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,518
- Cool.
- Yeah.

437
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,785
Thanks, that's awesome.

438
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:56,757
I need to
get some stuff.

439
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,556
Praise the Lord!

440
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,995
Yeah, yeah, prai--

441
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:03,293
Uh, praise the Lord.

442
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,198
We got something.

443
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:06,860
Right now?

444
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,905
Yeah, right now.

445
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,873
Unless you want to
hang out with the skank.

446
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,352
What the hell, man?

447
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:30,620
Can't you see I'm busy?

448
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:33,526
- And God said unto thee...
- Let go of me!

449
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:36,395
“Smite the sinner!"

450
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:38,957
- Come on, man!
- Are you crazy?

451
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,435
Hey, piss on him.

452
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,494
What?

453
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,335
You want to get stoned
in the house of the Lord?

454
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,000
What the hell's your problem?
It's a bathroom!

455
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:48,476
Do it!

456
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:51,509
Whatcha doin', a-holes?

457
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:02,018
You know, you shouldn't
interfere with God's work.

458
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,253
God told you to put Johnson's
head in the urinal?

459
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,556
Yeah.

460
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,757
Whispered it
right into my ear.

461
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,561
Hmm.

462
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,902
Then God's as big a dick
as you are, Porter.

463
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,311
Gentlemen!

464
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,317
Have any of you seen
Bobby Overmeir?

465
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,649
Coach is looking for him.

466
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,814
What's a Bobby Overmeir?

467
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,948
Oh, you know--
star football player,

468
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:37,687
National Merit scholar,
all-around great kid.

469
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,456
Everything you're not,
Mr. Stukey.

470
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,793
Never hoped to be,
Vice Principal Carnes.

471
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,730
Get to class.

472
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,994
It was after Benedict Arnold was
cleared at the court-martial

473
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,336
that Washington issued
a reprimand,

474
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,866
when Benedict Arnold
almost gave up what?

475
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:57,879
Miss Burnett?

476
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:00,473
Uh...

477
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:02,518
I'm not sure
about that one.

478
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,349
Hmm.

479
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,446
And that would be because
you weren't listening?

480
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:09,754
And that would be because
you're so incredibly boring.

481
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,655
You, out.

482
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,872
Mitzy, do you know
the answer?

483
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,929
Um, West Point?

484
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:26,475
Thank you.

485
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,780
So, I'd say you owe me one.

486
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:37,342
You can...
spank me later.

487
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,251
Sp-- spank?

488
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,347
I am a connoisseur
of spanking!

489
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:43,585
Your parents must be
so proud, Mr. Stukey.

490
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,970
Oh, my gosh.

491
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:02,841
Anything look
familiar at all?

492
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:08,010
- In here, not so much.
- No?

493
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:10,279
Well, um...

494
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:12,343
I like it, though.

495
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,912
- Heh heh.
- Yeah.

496
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,514
It's pretty.

497
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,287
Yeah.

498
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:18,827
Yeah.

499
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,835
We have a cat?

500
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:33,366
Bunnie, seriously,
we need to talk, I--

501
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,638
Yeah, I know,
but it can wait.

502
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,441
Didn't the doctors
tell you?

503
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,610
Yeah, yeah.

504
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,652
Yeah, I have a little
bit of memory loss.

505
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:45,347
Yeah, like not remembering your
children and where you live--

506
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,481
But you know what, the idea of
having children

507
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:50,617
is starting to feel
really familiar to me.

508
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,787
That's a relief.

509
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,894
What's with this
belt buckle?

510
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,797
Honey, there are other things
we need to talk about

511
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,927
- other than your memory loss.
- That's great.

512
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:02,335
Let's talk about
the good things first.

513
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:03,599
Um--

514
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,599
Mmm.

515
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:08,302
Look, I know you don't
want me to lie--

516
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,868
- Wrong.
- You want me to lie?

517
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:11,914
Jack, just say that
everything is wonderful,

518
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,849
and if you say it enough,
it will be.

519
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,943
Who always
used to say that?

520
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,652
Your mother.

521
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,783
Oh, yeah.

522
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,793
Last thing I remember--

523
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:29,798
She and I weren't--
we weren't talking.

524
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,294
Tell me that we're
still not talking.

525
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,735
I gotta take this--
get off, get off.

526
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:37,272
It's Harv, it's Harv.

527
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:38,932
Harv, yeah, I just got her
back from the hospital.

528
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,772
Jack, what is it?
Are we talking?

529
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:43,642
She's moving in in two weeks,
you figure it out.

530
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:53,378
Ohh.

531
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:54,889
I'm sorry.

532
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:56,584
That's okay.

533
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,026
Oh, no, no,
no, it isn't.

534
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,560
Is all that stuff mine?

535
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:05,862
Sure as hell ain't mine.

536
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:09,903
Ohh.

537
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,567
I invited her, didn't I?

538
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,940
Uh, are we still
doing the lying thing?

539
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:18,845
Yeah.

540
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:20,940
Okay.

541
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,315
I invited her.

542
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,415
This is good.

543
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,750
I need to go to work.

544
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:05,925
We'll talk more later.

545
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:16,027
- Morning, Barbara.
- Good morning.

546
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,675
Morning, Alicia,
is there anything I--

547
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:28,149
Eunice, what's going on?

548
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,584
Up yours, Jack.

549
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:52,236
- What are you doing--
- How's the wife?

550
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:53,707
Wow, what did you--

551
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,938
- Still having memory problems?
- What?

552
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,673
Bet you like her
better that way.

553
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:58,679
Why was--

554
00:33:58,736 --> 00:33:59,714
She's a new woman,
so to speak.

555
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,614
- Did you fire...
- Hmm?

556
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:03,015
Eunice?

557
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,486
- No, she quit.
- Because... ?

558
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,614
Her department's
quarterly profits are down,

559
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:11,922
and her managerial
skills suck.

560
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,291
You told her that?

561
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:16,332
Didn't I tell you
this would be fun?

562
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,968
Anybody in here?

563
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,131
It's okay.

564
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:33,914
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

I knew Delbo
was a dyke.

00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,708
Are you
gonna report it?

575
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,539
Why should I give a shit?

576
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,408
It's weird about
Overmeir, huh?

577
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,547
Totally.

578
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,279
It's so unlike him
to just split like that.

579
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:11,979
You think?

580
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:14,455
Wouldn't know.

581
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:18,119
'Cause I heard you two hooked up
at Wailer's party last week.

582
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,065
Heh, whatever.

583
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,964
Oh, we gotta go.

584
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:39,177
I'll catch you guys later.

585
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:47,052
Hey-

586
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:49,216
Hey-

587
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,587
Want a better look?
Here.

588
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,598
Thanks.

589
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:03,861
It's, uh, kind of
weird looking.

590
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,532
No shit.

591
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,576
You're Eric's sister, right?

592
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,614
You're Delbo's bitch,
right?

593
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,910
I was in
one of the stalls

594
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:16,451
while you guys
were going at it.

595
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,919
I got a nice shot.

596
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,053
I'm not her bitch.

597
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,495
Eric talks about you
sometimes.

598
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,557
Yeah?
What does he say--

599
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:36,093
That I'm the gimp
at the locker next to his?

600
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,333
Something like that.

601
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:39,636
Actually, he said
you were nice.

602
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:42,339
Really?

603
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,073
Yeah.

604
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:48,244
But why would you care
what Eric thinks?

605
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:50,149
I don't.

606
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,921
What?

607
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,484
You're straight.

608
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,156
- No, I'm not.
- Bullshit.

609
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,927
- Fuck you.
- No, I don't think so.

610
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,468
I think you want
to fuck my brother.

611
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,197
Yeah?

612
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,102
Sorry.

613
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:12,607
Not my brand.

614
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:16,042
I'd rather eat pussy
than suck cock any day.

615
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,944
Well, how do you know
if you never tried?

616
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,561
Uhh!

617
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:00,055
Ask the Lord
for forgiveness.

618
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,920
Fuck you!

619
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:03,617
- Give me your pot!
- I don't have any!

620
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:08,187
Lying to me is like
lying to the Lord.

621
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:10,630
Now, give me your pot!

622
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,193
I knew it.

623
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,334
See?

624
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,272
You probably feel
better already.

625
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,968
Ohh!

626
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,945
Come on, get him off,
get him off!

627
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,639
- Get him off me!
- Son of a bitch!

628
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,081
Uhh! Fuck!

629
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,914
Oh, fuck!

630
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,455
Ohh, my God!

631
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:37,186
Holy shit! Fuck!

632
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,660
Oh, my God!
Holy shit!

633
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:41,492
Uhh!

634
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,030
Fuck.

635
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,036
Is he dead?

636
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:51,004
Come on, let's get
out of here.

637
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:54,009
Where are you guys going?
Give me some fucking help!

638
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:55,601
Fuck!

639
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:58,374
Fuck!

640
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:03,913
Fuck!
He's not breathing!

641
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,149
Your hair is broken.

642
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,658
That's great.

643
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,522
Mohawk's a bit retro,
don't you think?

644
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:49,496
Like you'd fuckin' know.

645
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,897
I know you shouldn't
have spit on me.

646
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,526
We're just doing
God's work.

647
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:56,800
That's bullshit-- you're using
God as an excuse

648
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,670
to beat up on people--
you're fanatics.

649
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,640
I know he doesn't
like dope dealers.

650
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:04,271
I'm not a fucking dealer--
that's my personal stash, man.

651
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,679
It's still a sin.

652
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,047
Dude, I need to sit down.

653
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:13,247
Where does it say
in the Bible

654
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,256
that smoking pot is a sin?

655
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:22,491
It doesn't actually talk about
marijuana in the Bible because--

656
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:25,466
because it wasn't
around back then.

657
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:27,935
How do you know
God doesn't like it?

658
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,635
Look, why didn't you
just leave me here?

659
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:41,377
Because killing
is a sin, too.

660
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:50,123
You should check out what your
buddy Andy does with my weed.

661
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,038
I was defending God.

662
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:12,444
And losing.

663
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:14,039
You didn't see
the other guy.

664
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,674
I bet he looked
much worse.

665
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:19,981
- Kitty--
- Kelly.

666
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:23,651
Kelly-- Kelly, would you pass
the salad, please?

667
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:26,126
- You hate salad.
- I do?

668
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,993
You used to like it when
we first got married.

669
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:31,226
So, why don't I
like it now?

670
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:32,926
You had it at one of
your charity things

671
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,401
and got sick on it.

672
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,062
At least,
you said you did.

673
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:37,662
Charity thing?

674
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:39,537
That's what you do.

675
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:42,168
You put on functions
for charity with Grandma.

676
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:45,043
Really? I do?

677
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:47,480
Do I get paid?

678
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:49,142
No.

679
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:51,083
You sort of do charity
for charity's sake.

680
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:52,381
Kelly.

681
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,081
She doesn't even
remember my name, Dad.

682
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:56,420
I'm-- I'm trying,
darling, I really am.

683
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,391
I'm sorry, it's just--

684
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:00,656
Everything is just
so damned hazy.

685
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:07,362
Maybe if we tried to do some
things together as a family,

686
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:09,927
that would help
to bring things back.

687
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:11,371
Yeah, that'll work.

688
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:13,101
Kelly.

689
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:15,302
She doesn't
need the attitude.

690
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,573
The town carnival
is tomorrow.

691
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,945
Really?
I love a carnival!

692
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,824
- I don't?
- Not really, no.

693
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,085
What do I like?

694
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:34,322
- Diseases.
- Mm.

695
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,661
Yeah, you like
diseases a lot.

696
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,926
Yeah, diseases.

697
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:39,626
- That's your thing.
- Mm-hmm.

698
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,363
You do that a lot.

699
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:43,962
With Grandma and stuff.

700
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:48,335
Oh, Nina called.

701
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,905
She said she wanted to see
how I was doing.

702
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:00,349
Nothing's going on.

703
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,119
I-- I didn't say
that there was.

704
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:09,186
I'm surprised
you remember Nina.

705
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,970
Your memory seems
to be getting better.

706
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:18,563
That's good.

707
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:25,702
I'm thinking maybe
we should...

708
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,306
go see some kind
of therapist.

709
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:31,216
As a-- as a family.

710
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,152
We don't do well
with therapists.

711
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:48,897
My mother-- did she
buy us this house?

712
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,032
She bought it for you.

713
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:58,908
I let her?

714
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,647
- Yes.
- Why?

715
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,245
Because we couldn't afford this
neighborhood otherwise.

716
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,953
I couldn't afford
this neighborhood.

717
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:21,034
We've let her buy us a lot of
things, haven't we?

718
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:25,965
Yes.

719
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,293
Bunnie.

720
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:28,803
I'll be right there.

721
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,347
Is Mom coming, or--

722
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,281
Oh, there she is.

723
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,148
She's wearing
my blouse.

724
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:46,347
Nice tits, Mom.

725
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:50,615

00:45:56,186 --> 00:46:00,191

Dude, that's so sick.

731
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:19,218
Where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

732
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,846
I don't know.

733
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:22,549
No, no, I'll take
two of those.

734
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,720
Who's your sister with?

735
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,092
No clue.

736
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:30,098
She seems to know you.

737
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,263
Your sister's not the
friendliest chick in the world,

738
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:36,861
is she?

739
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:38,634
Eric.

740
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:39,935
Reverend.

741
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:42,102
Who's your friend?

742
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:45,613
This is Paul Stukey.

743
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:47,615
- Nice to meet you, Paul.
- Pleasure.

744
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,618
Wax, I wax it.

745
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:55,679
Wax holds it up.

746
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,726
Uh-huh.

747
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:03,729
We'd better get going.

748
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:07,667
Um, Reverend.

749
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:08,964
Uh, see you, Reverend.

750
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:10,300
Yep-

751
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:28,088
60 bucks? You said 80.

752
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:29,624
Told you.

753
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:33,554
Let's get out of here.

754
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:43,902
So, how much did you
really hang out with Overmeir?

755
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:45,599
How'd you know about that?

756
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:47,664
He wrote about it
on his blog.

757
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:49,733
I didn't know
he had one.

758
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,575
Yeah, he wrote
really bad poetry.

759
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:52,978
Yeah, he read me some.

760
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,845
We were
at this party,

761
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:57,010
and he really started
laying on the moves,

762
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:59,680
like trying
to kiss me and shit.

763
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,848
There was no way.

764
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:05,860
So, I told him I'd give him
a quick B.J. if he laid off.

765
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,658
Really?

766
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,596
Yeah.

767
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:12,895
We were headed up
to his bedroom.

768
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:15,129
The loser
got so excited,

769
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:17,672
halfway up the stairs,
he creams himself,

770
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,607
and I get home in time
to watch Rachael Ray.

771
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:25,908
You cold?

772
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:27,846
I'm fine.

773
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:31,045
- Oh, that's a first.
- What?

774
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:32,849
You're smiling.

775
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,754
Oh, yeah.

776
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:37,758
Is that better?

777
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:39,657
I'm serious,
you haven't smiled once

778
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:41,320
since I came home
from the hospital.

779
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:43,126
Well... I was
worried about you.

780
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:46,133
I know, but I'm gonna
be fine.

781
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:48,726
I'm even starting
to remember some things.

782
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:50,794

783
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,568

Hmm, whoa.

788
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:02,212
Are you still
afraid of heights?

789
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,808
Well, yeah, when it, um--

790
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:05,751
When I look down
or up or--

791
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:10,689
- Ha ha!
- Wow.

792
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:13,057
- That's ridiculous.
- He must really like you.

793
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:16,621
What happened
to your nose?

794
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,064
Uh, vigorous picking.

795
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,067
Hmm, one of your
better traits, I'm sure.

796
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,933
I remember us being in love.

797
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:24,802
S-- something's
happening here.

798
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:26,807
I remember when you couldn't
keep your hands off me,

799
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:28,274
no matter where we were.

800
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:30,312
Yeah, Bunnie,
but, um... something's wrong.

801
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,971
Very wrong.

802
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:34,276
What's this guy--
oh, Jesus.

803
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,249
- Tell me.
- Ohh.

804
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,286
Honey, tell me what
happened to us.

805
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:40,788
No, I--
You know what, um...

806
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:42,687
Can't you see that
something's going--

807
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:44,885
Yeah, you don't even want to
kiss me anymore.

808
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:46,655
But, Bunnie, I'm having--

809
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:48,719
there's some sort of
major malfunction

810
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:50,731
going on down here.

811
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:52,289
I think
I'm gonna be sick.

812
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:55,565
What are you--
Jesus, Bunnie.

813
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:58,902
Oh, wait-- but--

814
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:01,169
You know, you used to love it
when I'd do this.

815
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:03,177
In front of
all kinds of people.

816
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:05,110
Yeah, but l-- Bunnie!

817
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,671
Bunnie, Bunnie.

818
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:09,240
Dude.

819
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:13,278
So gross.

820
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,823
Maybe their marriage
will survive.

821
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:22,057
You think that Mom's
having a nervous breakdown?

822
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:26,966
No, I just think she's nuts.

823
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,630
Were you nuts when you
ripped off your blouse?

824
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,936
Yeah, that was different.

825
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:37,843
How about giving blow jobs
to any guy that asks?

826
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:39,244
Does that mean you're nuts?

827
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:41,373
No, it means
I'm generous.

828
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:43,111
Hmm.

829
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,081
You know I don't
really do that.

830
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:54,727
Yeah, I know,
I know you don't.

831
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:56,787
You just want people
to think that you do.

832
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:01,269
Good morning.

833
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:03,861
- Uh...
- Good morning.

834
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:05,736
Uh... heh.

835
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:07,571
Can we ask you a question?

836
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:09,804
Does it have anything
to do with yesterday?

837
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:11,174
Yes.

838
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,043
Then no, you can't.

839
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:15,174
Did anybody get the paper?

840
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,184
- No.
- Nope.

841
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,313
Fine, let's get
ready to go, okay?

842
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:30,127
Hi.

843
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:31,860
Josh.

844
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,924
I'm surprised
you remember my name.

845
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:36,231
Oh, little things are
starting to come back to me.

846
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:38,967
- SO, you're feeling better?
- Much.

847
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:42,340
Good, I just thought
I'd do something for Bobby.

848
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:44,345
Oh, sure, sure, sure.

849
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:48,645
Do you smell that?

850
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:50,207
Yeah, a little.

851
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:01,753
You know, Dad and I have been
praying for you.

852
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:03,627
Well, thanks.

853
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:06,993
Josh.

854
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:10,668
Time to go for church.

855
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,589
I swear, Reverend.

856
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,130
It wasn't
what you think!

857
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:38,962
Look at me and swear
to the Almighty.

858
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,604
I swear.

859
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,165
You wouldn't lie to me right
beside the house of the Lord?

860
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:49,869
No.

861
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:51,708
You use your faith
as a guise

862
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:53,748
to hide your evil.

863
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:55,908
Give it to me.

864
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:57,144
Now.

865
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,750
Get out of my sight.

866
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:25,842
Not bad.

867
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:28,907
Thank you
for coming, dear.

868
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:30,645
You're welcome,
can we go home now?

869
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,186
No.

870
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:34,848
- Morning, Mrs. Burnett.
- Morning.

871
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:36,288
What are you doing here?

872
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,019
Oh, I'll see you inside.

873
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:40,925
Nice to see you got
all spruced up.

874
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:42,793
I did it all
for you and God.

875
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,828
Dude, I can't stop thinking
about your sister.

876
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,099
- Forget it.
- Why?

877
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:53,732
- You're dead, Stukey!
- Up yours, Porter.

878
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:56,038
You ratted me out.

879
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:58,045
Dude, you almost
killed me.

880
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:03,214
What the hell are you
doing with him, Eric?

881
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,717
Um...

882
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:08,881
We're friends.

883
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,097
Then ye shall reap
what thou sows.

884
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:29,304
What a dick.

885
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:34,844
We're friends?

886
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,577
Yeah.

887
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:48,262
Thank you, Jesus,
thank you.

Excuse me?

898
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:13,675
Fuck is
your problem, Jack?

899
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:15,341
Jack?
Do we know each other?

900
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:17,885
Man, fuck off, huh?!

901
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:19,784
Do that.

902
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:44,378
Hey-

903
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:46,641
Josh-- hey, hey.

904
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:48,546
- I need to talk to you.
- What's the matter?

905
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:50,448
- I need help.
- Is there a problem?

906
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:51,918
I can't talk
about it right now.

907
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:53,352
What's the problem,
what is it?

908
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,855
Can we talk about it
tonight, okay?

909
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,720
- Tonight? With me?
- Please.

910
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,953
I can't--
Josh, I can't.

911
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:01,291
7:30, please... please.

912
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:03,262
Lookout Park,
7:30, okay?

913
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:05,321
Okay.

914
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:06,867
You okay?

915
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:31,425
- Morning, Barbara.
- Morning.

916
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:47,506
You want to come?

917
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:49,566
Excuse me?

918
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:50,667
Lunch?

919
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:52,269
Not really hungry.

920
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:54,645
You and Bunnie finally
having sex again?

921
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:56,377
Oh, I don't--
I don't think--

922
00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:58,817
You know, I think
about us sometimes.

923
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:03,918
She knew, Nina.

924
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,721
Knew what?

925
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:07,318
Nothing ever happened.

926
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:09,727
Well, I told her
it might.

927
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:17,800
We probably should've had
our little bump and grind.

928
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:21,331
That way, the two of you
would've got over it by now.

929
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,656
Keep those
profit margins up, Jack.

930
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:40,820
You and Nina--
doing a terrific job.

931
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:43,262
Thanks, Harv.

932
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:57,937
What are you doing?

933
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:00,811
- I got fired.
- What? Why?

934
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,975
Ask Nina.

935
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:09,780
Sit tight,
I'm gonna handle this.

936
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,857
I knew you had balls, but you
can't fire Alicia like that.

937
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,922
You're so busy
looking at her tits,

938
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:21,195
you didn't even know
if she could type.

939
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:23,237
Know what I'm gonna do?

940
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:25,364
I'm gonna hire her back.

941
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:27,339
Yeah?

942
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,673
You'll have to hire yourself
back first, won't you?

943
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,336
What?

944
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,347
Harv finally came
to the conclusion

945
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:36,247
that one hatchet person was
more than enough.

946
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:38,479
I just saw him!

947
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:41,488
He was just telling me what
a great job I'm doing.

948
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:44,491
See how quickly
you get to see him again.

949
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:56,397
Harv?

950
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:58,268
Harv, I know
you're in there.

951
00:59:58,328 --> 01:00:00,899
Open the goddamn door!
Son of a bitch.

952
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:03,675
Ow!

953
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:12,384
Don't have time
to talk now, Jack.

954
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,716
Make the time, Harv.

955
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,380
It wasn't personal.

956
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,322
Fuck you!
And that is personal.

957
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:18,825
If we're not gonna
discuss this civilly--

958
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:20,417
You're a dick, Harv!

959
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:21,928
I'm gonna have
to call security

960
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:23,862
if you don't get
hold of yourself.

961
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:28,802
Thank you.

962
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:36,409
What--

963
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:39,809
Son of a bitch!

964
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:47,419
Yeah, yeah, and you're boning
Nina, too, aren't you?

965
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,616
- Did she tell you that?
- She didn't have to!

966
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,556
I still got
the dildo, Harv.

967
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:53,321
And I bet I could take it
into a lab

968
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:55,021
and get your DNA off it, too.

969
01:00:57,754 --> 01:01:01,327
What's your DNA doing
on a dildo, Harv?

970
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:06,571
It's a...
prostate problem.

971
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:22,786
Quack, quack, quack,
quack, quack, quack.

972
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:24,916
Yeah.

973
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:26,927
You diggin' it, dude?

974
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:28,724
Yeah.

975
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:30,662
That's good, good.

976
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:37,696
I gotta show you
something.

977
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,467
Yeah.

978
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:43,944
Oh, shit.

979
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:48,006
Where'd you get that?

980
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:50,278
Reverend Diggs.

981
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:51,943
Bullshit.

982
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:54,955
He-- he wants me
to enter

983
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:59,016
this U.S. target-
shooting contest.

984
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:01,619
Says it's my
God-given gift.

985
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:06,229
Is it loaded?

986
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:07,632
Nah.

987
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:15,576
It's-- it's heavy.

988
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:17,508
Switch with me, man.

989
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:29,416
- Here.
- Yeah.

990
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:30,924
I gotta take a piss.

991
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,653
You do that.

992
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:36,725
Ohh, yeah.

993
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:38,527
All right.

994
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,431
There's all these ants.

995
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,534
Look, I'm gonna
pee on the ants.

996
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,801
Do you think God
really gives a shit

997
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:49,275
whether you can shoot
this thing or not?

998
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:55,407
Fuck!

999
01:02:57,006 --> 01:02:58,883
Eric?

1000
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,887
Eric, man, are you okay?

1001
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:07,384
Oh, fuck, oh.

1002
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,895
Hey, man.

1003
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:11,955
Oh, hey.

1004
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:13,500
Oh, shit.

1005
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:15,763
Eric, hey man,
are you all right?

1006
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:17,668
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

1007
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:19,570
- Blow me-- ha ha ha ha ha!
- Fuck!

1008
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,370
Shit, dude!

1009
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:22,773
Fuck you, dude!

1010
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:24,402
You were freakin' out
so bad.

1011
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,946
Dude, I thought
you were fuckin' dead!

1012
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:27,640
No.

1013
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:28,977
I'm high.

1014
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:33,379
No, I'm fine, Mom, really.

1015
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:37,915
Yes, I got your check,
thank you.

1016
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:43,594
Still divorcing Jack?

1017
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,564
No! What--

1018
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:48,864
I mean, we're fine,
we're fine.

1019
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:52,395
Well, I don't think
it's a mistake.

1020
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:54,668
I'm not being
belligerent, Mom.

1021
01:03:56,866 --> 01:03:58,743
Oh, come on!

1022
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:01,941
She said
she's in love with me.

1023
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:03,677
Delbo?

1024
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:05,616
Shit, get out!

1025
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,916
What, you don't think someone
could love me 'cause of this?

1026
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:10,617
Oh, stop being
a drama queen.

1027
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,956
So, what'd you say?

1028
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:16,622
I told her I was in love
with somebody else.

1029
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,292
Cool.

1030
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:20,766
Who?

1031
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:22,632
Does it matter?

1032
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,229
I'm going to her apartment
tonight to break it off.

1033
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:27,240
Yeah, I think that's
the right thing.

1034
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:29,276
Well, you're coming with me.

1035
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:32,644
- What? No.
- Yeah, dude.

1036
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,443
No, there's no way
I'm doing that.

1037
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:36,449
- Seriously, broheim.
- That's not my thing.

1038
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:39,577
Like, I don't do confrontation,
I don't do that shit.

1039
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:41,519
My old man
doesn't like me.

1040
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:43,284
Bullshit.

1041
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,257
He like Kelly?

1042
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:50,795
Yeah, he likes her.

1043
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:54,526
I guess it's understandable.

1044
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:59,596
In a way, he's kind of got more
control over her.

1045
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:02,404
Well, my pops
always says...

1046
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:05,641
that being in control

1047
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:07,544
is always having a plan "B."

1048
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,685
Reverend Diggs
says that...

1049
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:14,415
religion should give you
all the control you need.

1050
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:19,287
Yeah, but what the fuck
else is he gonna say?

1051
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:50,590
Whatever this is about--

1052
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:52,319
Listen to me, okay?

1053
01:05:52,381 --> 01:05:55,590
Okay, no, no, no, no,
you listen to me.

1054
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:59,121
I don't remember what
happened between us.

1055
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:02,533
But whatever it was,
it will never happen again.

1056
01:06:02,591 --> 01:06:04,969
- Do you understand?
- I love you.

1057
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:06,563
And you love me, too.

1058
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,540
'Cause what we did,
we couldn't do unless--

1059
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,412
I-- I don't love you.

1060
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,141
But what about
what me and you--

1061
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:16,547
- You get out of this car.
- You can't--

1062
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:19,415
- Go on, get out right now.
- NO, no.

1063
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:21,216
You get out of
this car right now!

1064
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:22,585
You love me.

1065
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,420
I'm sick,
this is sick.

1066
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,221
Say it!
Say that you love me.

1067
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:28,319
Do you understand that?
Get out of the car.

1068
01:06:28,384 --> 01:06:30,261
Go on, get out
of this car now.

1069
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,890
Conversation's over,
go home.

1070
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:43,506
Close that door.

1071
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:47,440
Here I go--
close that door, now.

1072
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:13,437
This is the house
right here,

1073
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:15,407
but ain't nobody out there,
it's dead as hell.

1074
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:23,615
The motherfucker from jail

1075
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:25,549
is following this
white bitch over here

1076
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:27,019
to this house, cuz.

1077
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:28,885
Simon.

1078
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:30,582
What the hell is going on
between you and Josh?

1079
01:07:30,646 --> 01:07:32,057
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?

1080
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:33,422
Don't lie to me!

1081
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:35,223
- Well, I don't really know.
- What?

1082
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:37,025
- Okay? I don't know.
- Bullshit!

1083
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:38,360
These mothers
is crazy, cuz.

1084
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:40,059
Where'd you find
this fool anyway?

1085
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:41,328
Google's a wonderful
thing, dawg.

1086
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,336
Ah! Ah, shit!

1087
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:45,030
- Shit! Shit!
- Simon--

1088
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:47,040
- Simon.
- Shit! Shit!

1089
01:07:47,096 --> 01:07:48,575
- You ready to do this shit?
- You ready?

1090
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:50,611
- Let's roll.
- Creep low, creep low.

1091
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:52,577
Simon, what's happening?

1092
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:55,908
What's happening-- I'll tell
you, your wife here--

1093
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:57,450
We almost had an accident.

1094
01:07:57,506 --> 01:07:59,110
Remember us, homeboy?!

1095
01:07:59,175 --> 01:08:00,620
I don't like them
fuckin' things!

1096
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:02,986
How the fuck else I'm gonna
get 'em in the house?

1097
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:07,992
What's wrong with you?

1098
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:10,496
Why you always talkin' shit,
nigga, always talkin' shit.

1099
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:12,260
Fellas, I don't know
what you're after,

1100
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:14,392
- but there's a brand-new XBox--
- Shut up!

1101
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:15,936
Take whatever you want!

1102
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:17,334
Shut up, white boy,

1103
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:19,031
before I bust a cap
on you right now!

1104
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,597
He's just trying
to explain--

1105
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:23,041
Who said you could talk?
Sit your ass down on the couch!

1106
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,136
Oreo-lookin' motherfucker!
Sit down!

1107
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:32,283
Why'd you have
to bring her?

1108
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:37,490
- What do you want?
- Hmm?

1109
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:39,321
Money, apologies,

1110
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:41,952
a passing grade
in history?

1111
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:43,428
Excuse me?

1112
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:45,363
You're not here
to blackmail me?

1113
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:47,298
No, she's not.

1114
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:50,565
Fine, then why
is she here?

1115
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:53,232
I want an "A" in history.

1116
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:56,037
What?

1117
01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:58,942
I refuse to be blackmailed by
a lowlife student

1118
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:01,345
who doesn't even know
who Benedict Arnold was.

1119
01:09:01,403 --> 01:09:03,212
Look who's talking
about lowlifes.

1120
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:05,912
At least I've never tried to
steal another woman's woman.

1121
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,386
She--

1122
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:09,389
She doesn't care
about the "A."

1123
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:11,982
She was just joking.

1124
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:15,153
I'll give you a "C", but this
all stays between us.

1125
01:09:15,217 --> 01:09:17,254
I want a "B."

1126
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,992
- C-plus.
- B-minus.

1127
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:20,465
- Fine.
- Okay, great.

1128
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:22,059
Let's go.

1129
01:09:22,124 --> 01:09:25,128
No, you... tell her
what you came for.

1130
01:09:25,194 --> 01:09:26,434
No, come on, let's go.

1131
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:27,997
Okay, she doesn't
love me.

1132
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:30,475
She has a crush
on my brother Eric.

1133
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:32,137
No, I don't.

1134
01:09:33,536 --> 01:09:35,413
You don't?

1135
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:37,542
No, I'm--

1136
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:41,582
I'm gay, and I love you.

1137
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:43,555
Well...

1138
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:48,357
that's just...
fan-fucking-tastic.

1139
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:56,461
Are you--
are you serious?

1140
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,505
Yeah.

1141
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:01,904
Kind of wish I wasn't.

1142
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,372
Where'd she go?

1143
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:09,343
Yeah-- oh.

1144
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:13,247
Hey, you--

1145
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:15,050
Where do you keep
your jewels and shit?

1146
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:18,182
- The jewels?
- Yeah, the jewels.

1147
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:20,625
- I can't remember.
- I don't know.

1148
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:22,663
Y'all got jewels, and neither
one of you know where they at?

1149
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:24,595
Well, it's kind of
complicated,

1150
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:27,031
because we weren't
getting along for awhile--

1151
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:28,591
Where are the fucking
jewels, cuz?!

1152
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:30,637
- I would tell you--
- I'm countin' to three,

1153
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:32,536
and I'm gonna blow
your fuckin'--

1154
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:34,074
What the fuck
are you doin', man?

1155
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:35,073
Give me this shit!

1156
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:36,939
You just gonna snatch
my piece, cuz?

1157
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:39,138
- You're damn right!
- Fuck you, cuz.

1158
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:45,149
I gotta get this--
it's my mama.

1159
01:10:45,207 --> 01:10:47,653
Mrs. Johnson?

1160
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:50,213
Shh!

1161
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:52,623
Hey, Mama! Hey!

1162
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:57,019
Hey, nigga, tell Mrs. Johnson
I say what--

1163
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,656
Uh-huh?

1164
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:00,359
Yeah, I know.

1165
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:02,026
Thomas Jefferson,
yeah, yeah.

1166
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:05,095
Right, no,
it's due Friday.

1167
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:08,073
Huh? I know.
I couldn't believe it.

1168
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:09,609
You said we might be
related-- that's crazy!

1169
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:12,043
Heh! Okay.

1170
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:14,047
I love you, too,
Mama, mwah!

1171
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,310
All right,
okay, bye, bye.

1172
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:18,978
Love my mama, ha ha!

1173
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:23,649
What-- I got a book report
for school.

1174
01:11:23,712 --> 01:11:25,953
You're in school?

1175
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:28,256
Hell yeah, my nigga is
a straight-A student.

1176
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:29,318
Trey!

1177
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:30,864
And his old man's
a dentist out in Cali.

1178
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:31,920
Shut up!

1179
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:33,489
Please, man!

1180
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:35,592
You hate when I talk
about your daddy.

1181
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:36,932
Now, listen,
you're gonna tell me

1182
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:38,665
where you keep your jewels,
all right?

1183
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:41,071
Or I'm gonna beat the fuck out
of you, you hear me?!

1184
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,542
I'm gonna bust your
fuckin' head wide open!

1185
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:45,203
I'm not fuckin' playin'!

1186
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:47,474
They're in
the master bathroom.

1187
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:50,380
Uh, go under the sink.

1188
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:52,612
They're in a douche bag.

1189
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:00,661
You ever think about
doing yourself?

1190
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:04,355
All the time.

1191
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,957
- How would you do it?
- How?

1192
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:09,969
With my hand,
how else am I gonna do it?

1193
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,139
Would you, like,
choke yourself?

1194
01:12:13,195 --> 01:12:16,733
I don't want to choke it,
bro, I mean--

1195
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:19,109
I want to... stroke it.

1196
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:22,783
Nah, I--

1197
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:24,977
I mean, you know--

1198
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,247
You ever think about--

1199
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:29,721
about doing yourself?

1200
01:12:29,778 --> 01:12:31,314
Oh.

1201
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,859
No.

1202
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:36,253
You?

1203
01:12:36,318 --> 01:12:38,127
Nah.

1204
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:42,168
Why do you look
so familiar?

1205
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:46,796
I jacked you before
or something?

1206
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:49,138
This would be
my first jacking.

1207
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,145
That nigga knew
right where it was at.

1208
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:55,307
How the hell do you know where
my wife hides her jewelry?

1209
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:58,750
I think he knows where
she hides a lot of things.

1210
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:05,013
Hey, go grab that.

1211
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:15,092
Hey, cuz!
We got a visitor.

1212
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:17,637
Nina?

1213
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:21,072
Mm, ugh-- what is
going on here, Jack?

1214
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:23,303
A little get-together,
that's all, ha ha!

1215
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:24,901
Bitch, get on the couch!

1216
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:26,844
What you think we doin'--
we got guns and shit.

1217
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:28,711
What is she doing here?

1218
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:31,581
I don't know-- what are you
doing here, Nina?

1219
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,745
You got me fired, asshole.

1220
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:35,720
- You got me fired first.
- Oh!

1221
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:36,916
You got fired?!

1222
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:38,754
Look what else I got, cuz.

1223
01:13:38,814 --> 01:13:40,191
- Well...
- Jack!

1224
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,593
She got transferred
into the--

1225
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:44,130
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

1226
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:45,722
Oh, yeah.

1227
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:51,227
Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.

1228
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:53,864
Oh, yeah, I like that.

1229
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:55,067
Stop!

1230
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:56,939
Hammer time.

1231
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:59,912
Ohh! Yeah.

1232
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:01,879
Ohh-- Let's ring
the bell, baby.

1233
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:04,781
- No.
- Come on, ring my bell.

1234
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:07,116
Ding! Ding!

1235
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:09,087
Whoo!

1236
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:11,715
Ohh! Ohh! Ding! Whoo!

1237
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:13,555
Ding!

1238
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:15,617
Oh!

1239
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:17,721
it's not like
it sounds, man.

1240
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:20,699
You know, they alter
them tapes all the time.

1241
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:23,999
Simon, cuz--
the ding-dong man!

1242
01:14:24,059 --> 01:14:25,970
A nerd name,
but it gets the--

1243
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:27,974
- We're done.
- Jack-- Jack, please!

1244
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:30,840
If we make it through this
alive, we're done-- done.

1245
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:32,572
- Sit your ass down.
- Fuck off.

1246
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:34,170
You were supposed
to be my friend.

1247
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:35,579
Sit your ass down.

1248
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:37,981
You see, actually, Jack,
all of your pseudo-liberal,

1249
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,781
ain't-it-great-being-friends-

1250
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:41,287
with-the-black-folk-
next-door shit...

1251
01:14:41,343 --> 01:14:43,118
never really cut it with me.

1252
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:44,350
Oh.

1253
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:47,724
So you fucked my wife
to get back at me?

1254
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:49,319
And if you think
I was the only one--

1255
01:14:49,384 --> 01:14:50,727
Well, yeah.

1256
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:52,857
- Only one?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

1257
01:14:52,921 --> 01:14:54,992
Yeah, ask her who else, hmm?
Ask her.

1258
01:14:55,057 --> 01:14:56,297
What the fuck
is he talking about?

1259
01:14:58,227 --> 01:14:59,900
Yeah, what am I
talking about?

1260
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:03,676
Josh.

1261
01:15:06,134 --> 01:15:08,842
So, you think
your sister's home?

1262
01:15:08,904 --> 01:15:10,884
Tsk, forget about it, dude,
it's weird.

1263
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:13,943
You're weird.

1264
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:15,682
No, man, that's weird.

1265
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:17,553
Nice parking job.

1266
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:19,684
Ha ha.

1267
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:21,728
Yeah.

1268
01:15:21,783 --> 01:15:24,127
I think that's
Josh's dad's car.

1269
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:25,722
Veronica, what the hell
are you doing?!

1270
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:27,733
I read your
space things, you know!

1271
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:29,166
Myspace?

1272
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:32,171
All you kids-- what
a bunch of narcissistic,

1273
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:34,138
whining little scumbags!

1274
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:37,006
Especially you.

1275
01:15:37,065 --> 01:15:38,567
Oh, really?

1276
01:15:38,634 --> 01:15:40,045
What does that
make you, then?

1277
01:15:40,102 --> 01:15:42,844
Broken-hearted.

1278
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:45,010
Bullshit.

1279
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:46,780
I'm out of here.

1280
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:50,119
Fine, go-- take your
girlfriend with you!

1281
01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:52,317
- I'm not her girlfriend!
- Right, we got it, Kelly.

1282
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,156
You'll give it up
for any asshole

1283
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:55,889
because you can't have
real feelings for anyone.

1284
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:57,589
I have real feelings.

1285
01:15:57,653 --> 01:16:00,259
Yeah? For who?

1286
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:02,734
I'm out of here.

1287
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:04,668
Mitzy!

1288
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:09,132
Eric, run!

1289
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:11,837
- Trey, shut that down!
- Can't go, either.

1290
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,548
- Let's rush 'em.
- What? What?

1291
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:21,554
- Shit!
- He's not so tough.

1292
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:23,214
His father's a dentist,
for God's sake.

1293
01:16:23,278 --> 01:16:25,849
- Yeah.
- Come to think of it...

1294
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:27,951
you ain't really no blacker
than I am, are you, boy?

1295
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:29,689
He doesn't even
have a gun.

1296
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:32,589
Oh, shit.

1297
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:34,258
What you call this, huh?

1298
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:36,860
He gets one of us,
the others take him down.

1299
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:38,268
You talkin' real crazy
right now.

1300
01:16:38,327 --> 01:16:40,864
No, I'm not,
I don't think so.

1301
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:42,169
- I don't think so, either.
- Ouch!

1302
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:45,972
( gunshot }

1303
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:48,844
Oh, shit!
They shootin' at me!

1304
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:51,111
Oh, shit! My ankle.

1305
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:52,584
- Eric.
- Oh, my God.

1306
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:54,143
Yo, we gotta bounce, cuz.

1307
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:55,847
- Did you get 'em?
- I couldn't get 'em.

1308
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:57,151
Man, they had guns
and everything.

1309
01:16:57,212 --> 01:16:58,850
Dodging bullets and shit.

1310
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:00,291
Just get the shit
and let's go, man.

1311
01:17:00,349 --> 01:17:02,260
Get on the goddamn couch!

1312
01:17:02,317 --> 01:17:04,729
We're not playin', man!

1313
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:06,527
- This shit never happened.
- You's a freak.

1314
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:10,202
- I gotta get my gun.
- Dude, forget the gun!

1315
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:11,828
We gotta get
the fuck out of here.

1316
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:13,566
Watch out!

1317
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:15,006
I'll go first.

1318
01:17:15,063 --> 01:17:16,565
- Right there!
- Where? Where?

1319
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:18,202
Ohh!

1320
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:19,677
Man, you shot my shit!

1321
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:21,112
- I'm sorry!
- You can't even shoot!

1322
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:23,547
No, I should probably be
the one to go first.

1323
01:17:23,605 --> 01:17:25,676
- Bunnie, would you--
- Oh, shit!

1324
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:27,220
Oh, crap!

1325
01:17:27,275 --> 01:17:28,948
Jesus!

1326
01:17:29,011 --> 01:17:30,820
Oh, my God!

1327
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:33,223
- I'm Simon.
- Nina.

1328
01:17:33,281 --> 01:17:36,558
You know, maybe she
doesn't even mean it.

1329
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:39,565
You know, maybe she just needs
time to think about it.

1330
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:40,964
Know what I mean?

1331
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:43,697
Yeah, it doesn't even
matter anymore.

1332
01:17:43,759 --> 01:17:46,968
Don't say that-- whoa.

1333
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:48,838
Shit!

1334
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:52,970
What the fuck?!
What the fuck?!

1335
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:55,037
- What the hell is this comin'?
- What is this?

1336
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:58,877
What's up, homeboys?

1337
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:01,250
Back your ass up.

1338
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:03,983
- Son of a bitch!
- Back the hell up!

1339
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:05,252
Fuckers!

1340
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:07,520
No!

1341
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,829
Oh, shit!

1342
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:20,796
What the fuck?

1343
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:27,204
Ohh, you broke my wallet.

1344
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:29,215
You're insane!

1345
01:18:35,277 --> 01:18:37,223
Whoa.

1346
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:39,850
Doesn't that kind of
look like Overmeir?

1347
01:18:39,915 --> 01:18:43,692
Yeah, just kind of
a bloated Overmeir.

1348
01:18:43,752 --> 01:18:47,256
Yeah, with, like,
a stretched-out neck.

1349
01:18:47,322 --> 01:18:49,563
Eric?

1350
01:18:49,624 --> 01:18:51,228
I'm all right.

1351
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:55,141
Jack...

1352
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:23,969
I don't want
the rubber chicken again.

1353
01:19:24,025 --> 01:19:25,629
Let's go with
the roast beef.

1354
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:26,934
Roast beef's too expensive.

1355
01:19:26,995 --> 01:19:28,531
We'll go with the chicken.

1356
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,975
Oh, my mother just walked in--
let me call you back.

1357
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:32,670
Heh heh.

1358
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:36,946
Another job interview?

1359
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:38,678
Yep-

1360
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:40,947
Your ear's bleeding.

1361
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:43,819
How the hell does he always
cut himself like that?

1362
01:19:43,879 --> 01:19:45,688
Nice to have you
here, Ilene.

1363
01:19:45,747 --> 01:19:47,226
Good luck, honey.

1364
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:51,221
He's never gonna get a job.

1365
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:57,727
Oh, you are wearing
your mother's blouse.

1366
01:19:57,793 --> 01:20:00,000
L-- I gave that
to her, Mom.

1367
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:03,138
You can see--

1368
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:04,871
it's fine, Mom.

1369
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:07,880
She looks really
beautiful in it.

1370
01:20:20,682 --> 01:20:22,628
What is a hero?

1371
01:20:22,684 --> 01:20:25,290
A hero is someone that you'd
want to be like,

1372
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:27,629
someone that you
look up to.

1373
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:30,033
Especially if they're hanging in
a tree outside your house.

1374
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:32,765
Bobby Overmeir was
that kind of kid.

1375
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:39,174
Even in death,
Bobby was able

1376
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:42,078
to tackle
a no-good gang banger.

1377
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:47,643
And there's another
hero here today,

1378
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:49,689
one who saved many lives

1379
01:20:49,744 --> 01:20:52,918
the night that Bobby's
poor body was discovered.

1380
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:54,892
That's Josh Krebs.

1381
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:56,691
Josh,
come up here, son.

1382
01:21:02,123 --> 01:21:03,761
It's loaded.

1383
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:06,604
It's beautiful.

1384
01:21:06,661 --> 01:21:07,969
You deserve it.

1385
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:11,110
On your way home,
stop at a range,

1386
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:12,611
try that baby out.

1387
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:14,772
What the hell
are you doing?

1388
01:21:14,836 --> 01:21:16,315
You gave him a gun?

1389
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:19,284
Yes.

1390
01:21:19,341 --> 01:21:20,945
Are you insane?

1391
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:22,613
After what our family's
been through?

1392
01:21:22,677 --> 01:21:25,248
Please-- Eric,
just give me the gun.

1393
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:28,624
- Give me the gun, Eric.
- it's up to me.

1394
01:21:28,683 --> 01:21:30,594
- Give me the fucking gun!
- No! Okay?

1395
01:21:30,652 --> 01:21:32,928
This is the only thing
that I'm good at.

1396
01:21:32,988 --> 01:21:38,802
The only thing you're good at
is being an idiot.

1397
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:40,203
Jack.

1398
01:21:40,262 --> 01:21:42,902
What? Look.

1399
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:46,036
How dare you talk
to him that way?

1400
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:48,012
“How dare you"?
You want to do “how dare you"?

1401
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:50,879
How about... how dare you do
what you did to me?

1402
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:55,884
Jack, a lot of things
are starting to come back to me.

1403
01:21:55,944 --> 01:21:58,823
A lot of things--
I didn't sleep with Josh.

1404
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,325
He wanted to,
but I didn't.

1405
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:03,261
That's a relief,
I feel a lot better.

1406
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:05,628
Well, I don't.

1407
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:06,961
This has always
been about you

1408
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:08,695
and the career that
you didn't have

1409
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:10,634
and the money that
you didn't make

1410
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:12,228
and the fact
that my mother

1411
01:22:12,294 --> 01:22:13,864
bought us that
fucking house!

1412
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:19,711
Let me talk to him--
Jack.

1413
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:23,115
I'm sorry.

1414
01:22:23,171 --> 01:22:25,276
I'm sorry, Kel.

1415
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:28,014
You're dead, Stukey!

1416
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:29,749
Andy!

1417
01:22:47,929 --> 01:22:51,638
Everything pretty much
happened in a rush after that.

1418
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,680
There was a funeral,

1419
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:56,045
and the Krebs decided
to move across town.

1420
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:01,885
Don't you forget
I paid for this house.

1421
01:23:01,943 --> 01:23:04,014
Yes, I won't forget that.

1422
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:05,922
But you put it in my name,

1423
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,756
and that makes it
legally mine.

1424
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:10,922
Fine-- why would I want to stay
in a place that I'm not wanted?

1425
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:13,796
It's not that
you're not wanted.

1426
01:23:13,855 --> 01:23:16,631
But, actually,
you're not wanted.

1427
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:18,568
And I'll tell you why.

1428
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:23,500
Because you're
a very selfish woman,

1429
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:25,442
and you've always
used your money

1430
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,275
to manipulate
anyone you can,

1431
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:28,643
but especially me!

1432
01:23:32,974 --> 01:23:35,511
Grandma never knew
what hit her.

1433
01:23:39,447 --> 01:23:40,653
It's time.

1434
01:23:43,718 --> 01:23:47,393
Ladies
and gentlemen,

1435
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:50,664
I'd like to introduce you
to a real hero tonight,

1436
01:23:50,725 --> 01:23:53,433
a young man we can all
be proud of.

1437
01:23:53,495 --> 01:23:55,532
So, what exactly
happened that day?

1438
01:23:55,597 --> 01:23:57,577
I'm not even sure myself.

1439
01:23:57,632 --> 01:23:59,543
Eric Burnett.

1440
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:10,620
It was pure instinct,
I guess.

1441
01:24:10,678 --> 01:24:14,216
The reverend probably would've
called it divine intervention.

1442
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:18,488
Also in the audience,

1443
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:22,626
we're very lucky to have with
us... two other heroes.

1444
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:26,228
Others might've
called it blind luck.

1445
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:38,374
Either way, even Dad
would have to admit--

1446
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,545
It was a hell of a shot.

1447
01:24:40,608 --> 01:24:43,646
Jack Burnett and his very
brave wife Bunnie--

1448
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:45,247
Eric's father and mother.

1449
01:24:46,648 --> 01:24:48,559
Let's face it.

1450
01:24:48,616 --> 01:24:50,653
The fact that this family
is still together

1451
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:53,790
is almost as much of a miracle
as those two bullets colliding.

1452
01:24:56,124 --> 01:24:57,694
I mean, my mom and dad

1453
01:24:57,759 --> 01:25:01,798
will never have
the perfect marriage...

1454
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:04,434
maybe not even close.

1455
01:25:06,534 --> 01:25:08,480
But they're still here.

1456
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:12,646
We all are.

1457
01:25:12,707 --> 01:25:15,210
That must say something.

1458
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,396
I don't know.

1459
01:25:24,452 --> 01:25:26,363
Maybe it takes
almost losing someone

1460
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:29,766
before you know how much
you're going to miss them.

1461
01:25:29,824 --> 01:25:33,397
Hey, I'm sure we'll
still have our moments.

1462
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:38,768
I mean, you have
parents, right?

1463
01:25:41,603 --> 01:25:43,776
The man's entitled
to his opinion.

1464
01:25:43,838 --> 01:25:45,579
