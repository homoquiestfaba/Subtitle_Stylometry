1
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:38,880
Alice!

2
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,760
Alice!

3
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,560
Alice. Oh, God, there you are.

4
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,460
Are you all right? Huh?

5
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,530
What happened?

6
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,100
Jakey Snyder came a calling,

7
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,940
on account of that debt
he says you owe him

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,070
for the rustling job in
Colorado last spring.

9
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,140
I don’t owe him a goddamn dime.

10
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,840
Well, it don’t matter,
because he says he’s going

11
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,780
to burn down this
house with us in it.

12
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,350
Our boy stopped him,
and he went and said

13
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,950
he’d wrangle the money and
get it to Jakey tomorrow.

14
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,320
I tried to stop him, Mike,

15
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,930
But you know, our boy
is getting to the age

16
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,330
where he thinks he can
handle things by himself.

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,800
Yeah, and he’s stubborn,
too, just like you.

18
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,970
Where’d you say he was going?

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,370
The bank in Sweetwater.

20
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,870
Oh...

21
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,040
I’ll handle that. I’ll
take care of this.

22
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,880
If that little prick comes back
here, you know how to use it.

23
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,650
Lock the doors.

24
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,250
You bring our boy back safe.

25
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,760
I will.

26
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,360
Madame, you got my word.

27
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,030
Put that goddamn thing away.

28
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,960
What are you doing, Robert?

29
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,236
Jakey Snyder said
he’s going to kill us

30
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,730
if we don’t settler your debt.

31
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,600
Jakey Snyder’s full of
shit, and you know that.

32
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,270
We got no other choice, Mike.

33
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,080
I did not ask you to do this.

34
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,250
The fact that you drag
your little friend in there

35
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,210
-into our business? -Yeah.

36
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,520
I can take care of Jakey
Snyder, believe me.

37
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,420
If you’d done any
kind of preparation

38
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,960
or homework on
this goddamn thing,

39
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,090
you would understand
that that bank

40
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,900
has been robbed seven times
in the last six months.

41
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,300
They brought Pinkertons in.

42
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,270
They brought railroad
detectives in.

43
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,140
Every other man on the
street is some kind of lawman

44
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,010
waiting for one thing: for
someone to cross the line.

45
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,040
-I don’t really care.
-Oh, really?

46
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,540
This isn’t cattle rustling.

47
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,040
This isn’t grifting.

48
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,150
This isn’t all that
petty little bullshit.

49
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,750
You rob a bank and you’re done.

50
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,550
Your picture is going to
be on every goddamn poster

51
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,160
from here to Fort Worth.

52
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,360
-I don’t... -Hear me.

53
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,460
Lost time is never found again.

54
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,270
Get your hands off me, old man.

55
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,640
Oh, sure, go ahead
and kill yourself.

56
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,570
You’re making a mistake.

57
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,610
You’re gonna regret it.

58
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,360
-All right, nobody move!
-Jesus Christ.

59
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,740
Chaz.

60
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,440
You wait till they come out.

61
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,570
Hurry up, you’ve got 30 seconds.

62
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,610
No, please!

63
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,120
Mister, get out of my way.

64
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,650
Otherwise, I’m going to assume

65
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,490
you’re a member of this
gang and treat you as such.

66
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,160
No, please. One of those
kids in there is my son.

67
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,490
Give me a chance to
just talk to him.

68
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,660
Do you understand?

69
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,560
Please.

70
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,300
Everybody deserves a second
chance, for Christ’s sake,

71
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,400
Not him.

72
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,410
[women screaming]

73
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,610
Detective Schumacher, move up!

74
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,650
[groans]

75
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,090
Throw your guns out and
come out with your hands up.

76
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,030
And I promise you,

77
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,300
your punishment will be
just and appropriate.

78
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,770
If you go against me,

79
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,640
it will be a death sentence
for the both of you.

80
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,740
Run!

81
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,750
Dolly! I dropped Dolly!

82
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,920
[grunts]

83
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,420
Son, you’re all alone now.
The law’s all around you.

84
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,720
[gunfire]

85
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,210
Jolena!

86
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,020
[woman screams]

87
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,620
Oh, God no! My baby!

88
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,440
You want to end up like
your friend or that old man

89
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,580
who got in my way bleeding
out in the street?

90
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,480
Or that little girl who got
caught in the crossfire?

91
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,720
Please, no!

92
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,250
Let’s make this easy!

93
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,820
[panting]

94
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,560
[gunshot]

95
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,430
[gunfire]

96
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,700
[groans]

97
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,040
[grunts]

98
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,980
Who was that with you?

99
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,580
No one.

100
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,680
Name.

101
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,580
Butch.

102
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,190
Last name.

103
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,790
Cassidy.

104
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,820
Good afternoon.

105
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,950
I understand you have a
safe aboard this train.

106
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,490
Yeah. We do.

107
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,710
It’s in the mail car.

108
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,630
[chuckles]

109
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,540
Ha!

110
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,570
That was one hell
of a rehearsal.

111
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,880
-What do you think, Butch?
-Good.

112
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,250
Except that last part where
you ran up like an idiot

113
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,580
and said my name, Bob.

114
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,550
Yeah, yeah. Sorry about that.

115
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,050
Questions? Everybody
knows their job?

116
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,350
You bet, Butch.

117
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,790
Good.

118
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,790
You do have a conductor
uniform, don’t you?

119
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,460
Of course I do.

120
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,830
All right.

121
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,730
Last thing we do
before we ride out is

122
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,930
Isom goes and cuts the telegraph
wires at the ticket office.

123
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,270
Ben, Laura, this being
your first job with us,

124
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,600
on account of being down a man

125
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,140
with Will Carver
still locked up,

126
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,216
we’re only here for the loot.

127
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,210
Not to kill nobody.

128
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,940
You’re only going to use your
guns if the plan goes to hell.

129
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,780
But no shooting.

130
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,010
-Understood? -Got it, Butch.

131
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,850
Understood.

132
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,290
Half for today and
half for tomorrow.

133
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,730
Thank you, Butch.

134
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,830
See y’all tomorrow at the
Northern Pacific Rail.

135
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,130
Didn’t he say the Southern
Pacific rail the other day?

136
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,770
Yeah, yeah, he did say that.

137
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,370
He’s your boy, Elzy.

138
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,686
I mean Northern, Southern, I
don’t think it matters too much

139
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,740
as long as train comes
in 9:00 A.M., right?

140
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,710
As long as he’s on it.

141
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,710
I mean, he wants the
second half of his money.

142
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,126
He don’t want to be
looking over his shoulder

143
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,680
the rest of his life.

144
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,980
There won’t be much life
left if he doesn’t show up.

145
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,860
We better get out of here.

146
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,390
Got a big day ahead
of us tomorrow.

147
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,910
[neighs]

148
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,690
All right, boy. We’re going.

149
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,350
Train’s early.

150
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,050
Gonna have to catch up to it.

151
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,460
Let’s get it. Hyah!

152
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,800
[train whistle blows]

153
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,090
[train whistle blows]

154
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,550
Let me help you
with that, Ma’am.

155
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,460
You sure it’s wise to
team up with these kids?

156
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,890
They’re a bit soft for my taste.

157
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,960
Uh-huh.

158
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,630
Butch Cassidy.

159
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,460
Breaking all them young hearts.

160
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,000
Butch Cassidy is a good scout

161
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,730
when it comes to robbing
banks and trains.

162
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
Always has a solid plan,
always gets the loot.

163
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,640
Nothing ever goes wrong.
There’s nothing to worry about.

164
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,340
I’m reckon that’s all true.

165
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,610
I just don’t see why he’s
so against killing someone.

166
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,750
To each his own, Ben.

167
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,950
As long as Butch
can hold his own.

168
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,750
If it comes to a gunfight.

169
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,020
That’s my girl.

170
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,820
You two knock it off.

171
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,290
-[train whistle
blows] -All aboard!

172
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,660
Wait, wait, who the
hell is that with Bob?

173
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,860
Hold on now.

174
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,740
Hold on.

175
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,110
Elzy?

176
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,140
Let’s just give it a minute.

177
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,326
I mean, maybe this guy’s shift’s
ending and then Bob’s coming in.

178
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,710
He would have said something
if that was the case.

179
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,620
Just give it a minute, okay?

180
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,290
Sheriff!

181
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,260
Butch Cassidy and the Wild Bunch
is robbing the Union Flyer.

182
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,360
We got this. Come on!

183
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,670
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Union Flyer’s

184
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,270
9:00 A.M. departure for Durango.

185
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,220
Please have your tickets
prepared for boarding.

186
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,910
The Union Flyer?

187
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,346
It’s not even the
same train, Butch.

188
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,310
What are we gonna do?

189
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,950
I’m calling it.

190
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,220
What’s that mean?

191
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,050
We ain’t robbin’ the train now?

192
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,720
Hell, no.

193
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,620
I saw we do this kid.

194
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,860
I need that money.

195
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,036
All these trains
come from Dubois

196
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,390
got a company safe on them.

197
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,760
They’re all headed west
on that rail expansion.

198
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,500
And there will be
something on board.

199
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,230
And we take whatever they got.

200
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,300
Yeah.

201
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,610
Follow me.

202
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,140
Damn it, Curry.

203
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,310
Last call aboard 9:00 a.m.
Union Flyer. Thanks, sir.

204
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,650
Greeting. Tickets, folks.

205
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,560
Don’t do anything
dumb, Mr. Conductor.

206
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,360
We do as planned.

207
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,360
Butch, you sure we
should be doing this?

208
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,030
We don’t know nothing
about this train.

209
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,000
Isom, I’m need you to
calm down and focus.

210
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,610
What we doing, Elzy?

211
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,840
We’re going.

212
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,920
And who might you be, sir?

213
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,350
Name’s Edward. My
friends call me Eddie.

214
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,860
Well, Eddie, wait here a moment
with my friends won’t ya?

215
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,790
-Don’t do nothing stupid. -Yeah.

216
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,990
You, too.

217
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,830
Good morning, everyone.

218
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,330
Now, I’m not
looking to hurt you,

219
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,300
and I’m not after
your possessions.

220
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,310
Just need a little bit of
time and then you’re back

221
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:47,080
on your way to Durango,
is it? It’s a nice town.

222
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,780
Y’all look like a smart bunch,

223
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,250
so don’t nobody go
trying to be a hero.

224
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,050
Your lives ain’t worth it.

225
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,830
Schofield?

226
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,730
That’s a nice gun, old timer.

227
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
Sit tight now.

228
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,840
I got a dilemma I was hoping
you could help me out with.

229
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,110
Which one of these coaches
has a safe on it, Eddie?

230
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,180
Oh, they don’t tell us that.

231
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,220
[gun clicks]

232
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,190
It’s just a few cars back.

233
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,190
Kindly take us there, won’t you?

234
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,030
Yeah.

235
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,670
Knew that seed spitting
sack of shit Bob Meeks

236
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,840
couldn’t be trusted.

237
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,680
Working this shift
all da, Eddie?

238
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,140
-What? -You heard me.

239
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,610
Just you supposed to be the
only one working here today?

240
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,720
I don’t understand what
you’re saying, son, but yeah,

241
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,290
I’m working all day if
that’s what you’re asking.

242
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,160
You’re going to help us
out today, huh, Eddie?

243
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,760
Yeah. This is the car
with the safe in it.

244
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,560
Ain’t going to be no
surprises on there. No guards?

245
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:15,530
No, No, uh-uh, just the
safe in there, I promise.

246
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,170
Unlock that door and slide
it open for us, won’t you?

247
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,540
Yeah.

248
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:31,350
Climb up in there and open the
safe for us, will you, Eddie?

249
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,320
I can’t.

250
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,250
No, I can’t. I promise.

251
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,760
Wells Fargo, they don’t
give us the key no more.

252
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,830
Liar.

253
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,190
What he’s saying is true.

254
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,536
Throw some gunpowder
in that keyhole.

255
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,560
-We’ll blast it open.
-Sure thing.

256
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,350
Hey, boss, that
door is real thick.

257
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,130
I’m going to have to
use all the gunpowder.

258
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,880
We’re already here.

259
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,120
We ain’t walking
away from this one.

260
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,160
How big a blast are we talking?

261
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,630
I mean... it ain’t
gonna go beyond the car.

262
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,990
Make sure.

263
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,760
There’s kids and
parents on the train.

264
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,570
I want nobody getting hurt.

265
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,830
You got it.

266
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,840
Ha!

267
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,240
You’re Butch Cassidy.

268
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,270
Yeah. You all the
wild bunch, ain’t ya?

269
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,180
Of course, I should have
figured that one out.

270
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,480
See, Butch Cassidy
don’t kill nobody.

271
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,050
There’s always a first.

272
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,980
Ain’t nobody getting killed.

273
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,180
He knows who we are.

274
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,620
And you won’t say
nothing will ya, Eddie?

275
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,550
No, I ain’t going
to say nothing.

276
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,330
Hey, you know, it
was them Daltons.

277
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,960
Dalton gang done did it. Yep.

278
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,176
I’m ready to blow
this thing, boss.

279
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,370
All right, let’s clear the door.

280
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,730
Where do you think you’re going?

281
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,670
-Nowhere. Nowhere.
-Get over there.

282
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,340
All right.

283
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,020
[explosion]

284
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,990
It’s the Wild Bunch.
We’re being robbed.

285
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,030
Woo-hoo!

286
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,270
Get.

287
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,040
[cheering]

288
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,180
Look at all that money!

289
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,280
You wanted to walk a
couple minutes ago.

290
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,850
-I’m glad we didn’t.
-What’d y’all find?

291
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,350
Oh, it’s a good thing we
didn’t walk on this one.

292
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,820
Plenty of money
for everyone, baby.

293
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,390
Pretty good take, boys.

294
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,410
Let’s get it packed up,
let’s get it out of here.

295
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,970
[gunshot]

296
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,080
What the hell did you do?

297
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,750
He made a run for it.

298
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,250
You couldn’t have ran after him?

299
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,990
I warned him the first time.

300
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,020
I told you there was
to be no killing.

301
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,260
Get that loot packed
up and let’s go.

302
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,430
[laughs]

303
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,550
They shot Eddie.

304
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,320
[laughing]

305
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,860
Oh, yeah, baby!

306
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,060
[laughing]

307
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,330
All right, let’s split up.

308
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,470
Curry, Ben, Laura, you
had east. We’ll ride west.

309
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,140
Meet up at the Hole
in the Wall tonight.

310
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,710
I’ve had enough of this.

311
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,650
I’m going to send a
wire to Charles Siringo

312
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,420
at the Pinkertons.

313
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,750
[telegraph clicking]

314
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,230
Chaz, bring that to me.

315
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,440
What is it, Charlie?

316
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,450
Butch Cassidy.

317
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,250
And his Wild Bunch.

318
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,460
They’ve robbed a train.

319
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,760
And killed a man.

320
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,070
Want me to hold off on
the McCarty’s, help ya?

321
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,800
No, I’ll handle this.

322
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,390
What’s wrong, Butch?

323
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,260
Need to make sure no
one is following us.

324
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,860
Looks like we’re clear.

325
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,300
Sheriff!

326
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,040
Sheriff, you just missed him.

327
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,340
They killed Eddie.

328
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,840
Aw, shit. Which way
did they go, Bart?

329
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,680
Kid Curry headed
east with two of them

330
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,750
and Butch and the other
two, they gone west.

331
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:40,450
Nobody seems to be able
to stop the Wild Bunch.

332
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,550
We’ll handle it.

333
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,560
You think Elzy’s going to be
all right riding off on his own?

334
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,576
Yeah, he’ll be all right. He
had to lead them off trail,

335
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,200
make sure they don’t tail us.

336
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:58,770
We should’ve never join up
with Curry and them other two.

337
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,200
They’re crazy.

338
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,370
Killing that old
man wasn’t right.

339
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,210
No, no, it wasn’t.

340
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,140
Ain’t nothing we
can do about it now.

341
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:11,450
I’ll tell you what we can do.
We never work with them again.

342
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,480
Yeah, when Will Carver
gets out of prison,

343
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,850
we can think about it.

344
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,760
For now, we got to work
with the folks we got.

345
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,390
Otherwise, there ain’t no sense
in calling us the Wild Bunch.

346
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,890
Well, here they come.

347
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,860
Got to get going here.

348
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,540
-Come on, get ’em! -[gunshots]

349
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,370
Gunshots! Hey, hey!
Where are you going?

350
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,510
Someone’s shooting at us!

351
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,730
Come on, Sheriff.

352
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,460
Pick up that gun. Pick it up.

353
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,030
Shame.

354
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:08,400
[gunshot]

355
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:21,580
[harmonica playing]

356
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,560
Shouldn’t they have
made it by now?

357
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,800
Maybe they camped out.

358
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,830
Maybe they got caught.

359
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:40,970
Doubtful.

360
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,710
Or maybe they ain’t coming.

361
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,310
Why wouldn’t they show up?

362
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,586
Because they got a bigger
share of the loot than we did.

363
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,580
No, that ain’t Curry’s style.

364
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,450
He’s violent, but
always keeps his word.

365
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,520
He’ll show.

366
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,990
Yeah. Bob ain’t show.

367
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,090
Let it go, Isom.

368
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,520
Come on, fellas.
What’s with the faces?

369
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,700
I’m not too hungry
right now, Maude.

370
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,030
You don’t know what
you missing, Butch.

371
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,500
Ah, just take it.

372
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,970
Maybe you’ll be hungry in a bit.

373
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,750
Would you look at that?

374
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,890
Sitting around a
campfire, singing songs.

375
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,690
You save some food
for us, Maude?

376
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,660
Yeah, I got some leftovers, Kid.

377
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,070
What about Bob?

378
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,770
He didn’t show. Something
must have happened.

379
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:48,000
-Anyone follow you? -No.

380
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,040
-You? -No.

381
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,680
Better wipe that look
off your face, Butch.

382
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,980
You killed someone at
one of my jobs today.

383
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,820
I told all y’all there
was to be no killing.

384
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,450
If you hadn’t trusted Elzy to
bring on that bum Bob Meeks,

385
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,220
nobody would have died.

386
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:07,790
I’m sorry, Butch. I don’t know
what happened, but I trust Bob.

387
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,530
He’s a straight shooter.

388
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,890
As the leader of this gang,

389
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,930
I should have checked
Bob out personally.

390
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,470
Especially after you
and Laura saw him

391
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,800
confuse the name of the rail.

392
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:22,000
If there’s anyone
to blame, it’s me.

393
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,640
It’s my fault that
he died today.

394
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,610
I’m glad we agree on something.

395
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,780
So we going to split
this money up or what?

396
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,150
All right, then. Isom.

397
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:46,130
[laughing]

398
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,860
-Yeah! -Woo!

399
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,730
[cheering]

400
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,370
What’ll you buy me?

401
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,100
Ooh, whatever you want, baby.

402
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:55,610
I’m gonna spend a whole summer
drowning in women and tequila!

403
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,180
♪ I’ve been traveling ♪

404
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,290
♪ All night long

405
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:14,190
♪ I’ve been traveling ♪

406
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,130
♪ Singing my song

407
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,830
What you going to do with
your share of the loot, Butch?

408
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,070
Retire?

409
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,346
You know ain’t nobody
live long enough

410
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,740
to retire from this, Isom.

411
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,670
Still ain’t answering
my question.

412
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:35,280
Remember Mike and Alice Cassidy?

413
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,710
Yeah, of course I do. Them
the folks that adopted you.

414
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:42,350
Well, you know, Mike
has since passed on.

415
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,390
Thinking about buying me a
small ranch near their property

416
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,060
outside of Dubois.

417
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,760
I help Alice out a little on
account of she’s all alone now.

418
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:54,400
That’s... That’s might
kind of you, Butch.

419
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,130
What you going to do on a ranch?

420
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,470
Someone got killed today, Isom.

421
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,140
I don’t want no more of what
happened today on my conscience.

422
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:09,710
I mean, it was bound to
happen sooner or later.

423
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,550
Just come with the job.

424
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,056
Feeling guilty
for that conductor

425
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,550
ain’t going to bring him back.

426
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,196
So now that you got
your share of the money,

427
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,790
it don’t matter that
Eddie was killed today?

428
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,620
I didn’t mean it
like that, Butch.

429
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,830
I’m sorry that we killed him.

430
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:32,640
I’m talking about you,
anyways. This ranch of yours.

431
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,870
Being a rancher.

432
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,040
Chicken, cattle, you
know, cows, all that.

433
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,510
That’s really what you want?

434
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,780
I want to be like Mike Cassidy.

435
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,650
Wake up, do the same
thing every day.

436
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,420
Chores, tend to the animals.

437
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,520
Have real work to do.

438
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:53,320
Growing up with him, I liked
that things had to get done.

439
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:56,630
Work had to get done every day.

440
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:00,230
Every day, I had
responsibilities.

441
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:04,030
Don’t sound too bad, really.
Owning you’re own land.

442
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,240
My daddy and his daddy,

443
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,610
they spent their whole
lives on the plantation.

444
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:19,920
I was lucky, I guess.
I got emancipated.

445
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:27,190
Hell, I might buy a
ranch right next to you.

446
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,130
Gonna have to do a
couple more jobs first.

447
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,030
Remember those numbers.

448
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:41,040
I got a safe at the Dubois Bank.
It’s the combination to it.

449
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,740
You’re welcome to
what’s in there.

450
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,080
That’s much appreciated, Butch,

451
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,180
but I don’t want no handouts.

452
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,950
That’s... That’s your money.

453
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,820
If you’re serious about
buying some property,

454
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,180
consider it a loan.

455
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:57,750
Get out now and pay
me back when you can.

456
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:01,060
I don’t know if I’m ready
for something like that yet.

457
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,730
Suit yourself.

458
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,830
Money’s there if you
change your mind.

459
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,110
Go ahead and hold onto that
for me, won’t you, Elzy?

460
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,480
Where you going?

461
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,880
Go check out some property.

462
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,950
- Y’all gonna be here, right?
- Hell yeah, we’ll be here.

463
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,726
We ain’t going nowhere. We
drank too much last night.

464
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,450
Yeah, we did, babe.

465
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,760
What are your plans?

466
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,560
Ride out to Robber’s
Roost, maybe.

467
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:17,470
We’re going to help
Harry Tracy on a job.

468
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,830
Careful on them trails.

469
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,740
They’ll be looking
harder for us now.

470
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,210
-Ready? -It’s a new day, Butch.

471
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,350
Get out.

472
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,850
[grunts]

473
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,890
Hold this a minute.

474
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,330
Hey, Karl.

475
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,130
Am I to understand you
got money to buy whiskey

476
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,770
but not pay for a chicken?

477
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,700
Huh?

478
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,670
I said I’d pay him next week.

479
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,180
That doesn’t answer my question.

480
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,410
[grunting]

481
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,450
Okay, I’m sorry. I promise.

482
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,450
[groaning]

483
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,720
I won’t do it ag...

484
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:17,190
No. You won’t.

485
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:24,870
Theft will not be
tolerated in Cheyenne.

486
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:28,470
And I don’t give a
damn if it’s a chicken,

487
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,770
a hog, or a herd of cattle

488
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,450
Now get.

489
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,620
All of you, get.

490
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,880
Come on, let’s go.

491
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,320
You hard of hearing, mister?

492
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,770
So this Karl fella,

493
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,800
is he a big problem
here in Cheyenne?

494
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:03,310
No. That was his first offense.

495
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,510
[chuckles]

496
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:11,510
-Did I say something funny?
-No. No.

497
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,890
I just admire your brand
of justice, Mr. Horn.

498
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:21,720
It’s called the law around here.

499
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:22,960
Fair enough.

500
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,530
Is there something
you want, Mr. Siringo?

501
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,530
I’m bringing in Butch
Cassidy and his Wild Bunch.

502
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,400
Dead or alive.

503
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,940
You may have heard
that they killed

504
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:41,140
an elder conductor
over in Wilcox.

505
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,450
Shot him in the back.

506
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:48,350
They also murdered
some local lawmen.

507
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,120
Yeah, I heard
something about that.

508
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:57,560
But it was Kid Curry that did
most of the killing, was it not?

509
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,900
Nonetheless.

510
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,870
Wild Bunch needs to
be brought to justice.

511
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:09,410
Hung by their necks,
every last one of them.

512
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,280
And I wanted to see if
I could recruit you,

513
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:18,280
Mr. Horn, in my endeavors.

514
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:21,050
I’m pretty settled in
here at the moment.

515
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,620
Understood.

516
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,120
You know...

517
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:33,160
The bounty is up to $30,000
for the whole Wild Bunch.

518
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,970
And I would be
willing, Mr. Horn,

519
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,370
to split that reward with you.

520
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,170
50/50.

521
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,510
That’s a lot of money.

522
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,610
It’s a lot of money.

523
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,106
We’re awfully close to
where we did that job

524
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,500
in Wilcox, ain’t we?

525
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,330
You know I want to be
close to Alice Cassidy.

526
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,270
Yeah. I keep forgetting
about Miss Cassidy.

527
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:16,610
What’s the local law like here?

528
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,310
They know me, on
account of Mike.

529
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,780
As long as I don’t
do nothing wrong

530
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,310
in Dubois, they
look the other way.

531
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,880
And I intend to
keep it like that.

532
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:27,080
Plus another banker here helped
Mike with all his affairs.

533
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,600
Isom.

534
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,270
You want that money
that’s in my safe,

535
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,576
why don’t you go on and get it?

536
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,240
I told you, I don’t
want no handout.

537
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,510
Ain’t a handout, it’s a loan.

538
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,210
I don’t want no loan, either.

539
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,210
I told you I make
the money myself.

540
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,950
Do it just like you.

541
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,950
When I’m ready.

542
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:01,420
You gotta learn to
commit to things, Isom.

543
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,826
Going back and
forth all the time,

544
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,326
don’t make up your
head about nothing.

545
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,710
Gonna be the death
of you one day.

546
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,630
Mr. Santiago
Maxwell, how are you?

547
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:11,830
Good.

548
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:15,330
I’m Fred Boone. No
relation to Daniel Boone.

549
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,600
-How are you? -I’m good, sir.

550
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:21,240
I’m Ted... Hiddlebottom.

551
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,070
So we are purchasing
the Bartlett ranch

552
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,240
just on the outskirts
of our little town.

553
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:28,116
- Correct, Mr. Maxwell?
- Yes, sir, that’s right.

554
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,180
I imagine we’ll be paying
cash for this transaction?

555
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,980
Or will it be in gold?

556
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:37,520
-Cash. -Cash is still good.

557
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,290
Oh, missing a few pages.

558
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,260
I’ll be right back.
Please, excuse me.

559
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:46,160
How much does this man
know about you, Butch?

560
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:49,060
Asking if you’re
paying in cash or gold?

561
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,100
Relax. He’s only asking about...

562
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:53,400
Don’t tell me to
relax. All right?

563
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:56,010
Does he or does he
not know who you are?

564
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,570
He knows who I am.

565
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,340
Just like the local law.

566
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:03,410
Fred altered Mike’s cattle
and horse paperwork.

567
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,580
Never steered him wrong
in all them years.

568
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,750
Here we go. If you
gentlemen follow me,

569
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,050
I can take care of you.

570
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,030
This is the title and the deed,

571
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,800
and I just need your
signature here, here,

572
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:28,340
here, and here.

573
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,510
How is Alice these days?

574
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,780
I’m hoping to help her out some.

575
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:40,380
That explains why you wanted
to purchase land there.

576
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,420
You have a generous heart.

577
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,120
Always in the right place.

578
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:49,190
Now there’s just the
actual money transfer.

579
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:55,560
Wonderful. I won’t even
bother to count it.

580
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,800
Just kidding.

581
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,740
I’m gonna get some fresh air.

582
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,450
Your friend seems
of the nervous sort.

583
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,320
The money’s all there.

584
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:17,790
You are now the proud
owner of the Bartlet Ranch.

585
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,290
Congratulations.

586
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,590
- Thank you, Fred.
- You’re welcome, as always.

587
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:25,130
And please, give my
regards to Mrs. Cassidy.

588
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,730
One more thing for you.

589
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:33,000
Some cookies from the "wife".

590
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:35,170
Oh, thank you.

591
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,310
I can’t wait to eat them.

592
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,840
Oh, Mr. Maxwell...

593
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,890
Just a little note
about a gold mine.

594
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,760
Wait until you’re out
of town to read it.

595
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:14,280
That man is the craziest banker
I’ve ever seen in my life.

596
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,710
Yeah, he might be strange,
but he is helpful.

597
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,680
What do you say we grab
a drink to celebrate?

598
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:23,920
-You buying? -Of course I am.

599
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,220
I could use a drink.

600
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,090
Hey!

601
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,490
-Sorry, sir. -Watch it.

602
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,900
Thought you said everyone
in this town was friendly.

603
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:39,370
Don’t know him.

604
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,900
Hey, isn’t that that
fella, Isom Dart?

605
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,310
I think so.

606
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:44,870
There’s a reward out for him.

607
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,980
Excuse me, sirs.

608
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,880
Hey, get back here!

609
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:08,030
You say you never
seen them guys before?

610
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,460
Never.

611
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:12,370
Hey, guess I gotta buy you
that drink another time.

612
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:14,276
Best to be clear out of
here before they come to.

613
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,270
Yeah, I agree with that.

614
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,810
You want to come back
to my ranch with me?

615
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:20,710
I got to get back to
the Hole in the Wall and

616
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,056
make sure Elzy and ain’t get
off with my share of the loot.

617
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,880
Be careful now. We’ll
all meet up again, soon.

618
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,120
Of course, Butch.

619
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:33,020
Hey, I appreciate you
bringing me along today.

620
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:34,460
It’s been real exciting.

621
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,890
Think about what I
said about the loan.

622
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,460
I will.

623
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,330
Get out of here.

624
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,630
I’ll see you, Butch.

625
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,130
Are you sure it was Isom Dart?

626
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,930
Come on, Sheriff.

627
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,370
Look who it is.

628
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:20,740
♪ Lord have mercy...

629
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,740
Excuse me, sir. We
need to talk to you.

630
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,610
God damn.

631
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,620
Turn around slowly.

632
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:39,860
Don’t make any moves for
that gun on your hip.

633
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,490
Now, that’s Isom Dart.

634
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,100
He’s wanted for cattle rustling.

635
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:02,310
Isom Dart was
arrested in Dubois.

636
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,510
Well, well.

637
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,060
Looks like we’re
going to have to pay

638
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:07,880
a little visit to Dubois.

639
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,420
You look parched.

640
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,820
Thank you, Alice.

641
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:49,490
Why don’t you take a break?

642
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,260
You know, it’s
been a while since

643
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:53,030
you’ve done this kind of work.

644
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:59,300
I sure wish Mike
could see you now.

645
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:01,900
He’d be so proud of you.

646
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,640
Oh, you still have
his old pocket watch?

647
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,780
Yeah, I do.

648
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:17,520
There’s something else going
on with you, ain’t there?

649
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:21,720
Mike made all this look so easy.

650
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:28,130
Mike made everything look easy.

651
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,470
But answer me this.

652
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,840
Why, after all them years,

653
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,640
do you want to come
back to what you left?

654
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:39,510
Alls I know is I
want something more

655
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:40,980
than robbing banks and trains.

656
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,080
If that makes sense.

657
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:44,850
Sure it does.

658
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:47,826
Kid Curry killing
that poor conductor

659
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:49,850
didn’t help none either.

660
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,150
Mike never killed nobody.

661
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:54,160
No, he didn’t.

662
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:59,830
But he sure came close
a couple of times.

663
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,870
Excuse me.

664
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:07,240
Did either of you lose a horse?

665
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:11,640
I found a wild one over yonder
hill grazing on my property.

666
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:14,040
Wouldn’t let me near it.

667
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,450
Must be old Billy.

668
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:20,250
Let him wander
from time to time.

669
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,750
You’re not worried
someone’s gonna snatch him?

670
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,050
I do apologize for
the inconvenience.

671
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:30,230
He usually manages to
find his way back home.

672
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:33,090
Well, I see you’re
working on a fence.

673
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,760
That’s a start.

674
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:37,900
I’m Alice, miss.

675
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:40,670
-And you are? -Etta. Etta Place.

676
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:43,070
-Pleasure to meet you. -And you.

677
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:49,110
Well, your horse has a name.
I reckon you have one, too.

678
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:54,320
Robert Parker, miss.

679
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,650
Nice to meet you, Robert Parker.

680
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,220
Could be straighter.

681
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:04,630
Yeah. Guess I don’t got such a
great eye for straight lines.

682
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,260
That’s an easy fix.
Got some twine?

683
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:09,970
Rope?

684
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:11,130
Thin rope.

685
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:16,170
-No. -I’ll be back.

686
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,850
Think I’m in love.

687
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:30,650
Robert Parker, you don’t
even know what it’s like

688
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,250
to be in love.

689
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,100
This town smells of shit.

690
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:48,440
Do you ever say anything
pleasant, Mr. Horn?

691
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,610
How do you want
to go about this?

692
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:53,280
What I want is to find
out where they are.

693
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,780
No matter what it takes.

694
00:48:56,410 --> 00:49:00,120
I hold now status of law outside
of Cheyenne, Mr. Siringo.

695
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,390
I noticed you don’t wear badge.

696
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:06,660
So how is it that you attained
your position of authority

697
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,090
in Cheyenne, exactly, Mr. Horn?

698
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,900
Understood.

699
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,900
This is your lucky day.

700
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,770
Oh...

701
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,280
It’s official.

702
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,780
You’re a Pinkerton now.

703
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:34,350
Thank you for your
help today, Etta.

704
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,120
It was my pleasure.

705
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:39,250
Always happy to lend a helping
hand to a new neighbor.

706
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,560
As long as I don’t find his
horse on my property again.

707
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,060
That’d be such a bad thing?

708
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:49,030
How did you get so handy?

709
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,200
Well, my dad was a cattle
man and I was an only child.

710
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:55,940
He wasted no time putting
me to work on that ranch.

711
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,210
You know, there
was this one time

712
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,850
when Mike was trying
to teach Robert

713
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:06,780
how to saddle a horse,
all proper and all.

714
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:09,820
And Robert wasn’t
having none of it.

715
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,820
And Mike was trying to tell him,

716
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:14,720
a horse keeps air in its belly,

717
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:18,160
so you got to wait to
cinch those straps.

718
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:22,630
And Robert snaps back, "I know
how to ride a horse, Mike.

719
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,070
I ain’t no kid."

720
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:27,370
And he was like 16
years old, mind you.

721
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:31,070
And what happened?

722
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:35,040
Well, he spurred ol’
Cinco and he took off.

723
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:39,010
And sure enough, that
saddle slid to the right

724
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:43,850
and Robert fell off over
the fence into the pig slop.

725
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:47,260
It was a mess.

726
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,360
Mike wouldn’t let him come
in the house for a week.

727
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:52,590
Made him sleep in the barn.

728
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:54,200
I would’ve done the same thing.

729
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,200
Get out.

730
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:00,840
[grunting]

731
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,310
[gunshot]

732
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:17,320
Hey, hey! Watch
where you’re going.

733
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:19,220
Bob! Bob!

734
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:21,490
Who you running from, mister?

735
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:24,790
Move on.

736
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:34,770
Mr. Horn, Isom’s been sentenced.

737
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,000
He’s going to serve his time.

738
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,370
Leave him be, Sheriff.

739
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:47,450
You were seen with Butch
Cassidy and the Wild Bunch

740
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,980
at the Wilcox train robbery.

741
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,090
[screams]

742
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,400
I ain’t going to ask you again.

743
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:07,200
I ain’t telling you nothing,
you goddamn Pinkerton.

744
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:10,840
I could put a few more
bullets in that leg of yours.

745
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:13,410
And you will never
use that leg again.

746
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:17,580
Or you can tell me
what I want to know.

747
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:19,550
Go to hell, you son of a bitch.

748
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:24,190
Mr. Horn, no!

749
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:29,120
[gunshot]

750
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,140
I was hoping Isom
Dart would give up

751
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:47,010
Butch Cassidy’s location.

752
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:50,880
But...

753
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,550
I guess I should
have just asked you.

754
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:08,160
You see, a reliable
source informed me...

755
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:13,900
that the local
law, that’d be you,

756
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:17,240
looks the other
way here in Dubois.

757
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:21,280
That Butch Cassidy
frequents Dubois.

758
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,110
And has for some time.

759
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:32,920
I’d really hate to
start killing off

760
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:37,130
fellow law enforcement
to get what I need.

761
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:39,230
There’s no need for
that, Detective.

762
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:42,730
Butch used to stay out at Mike
and Alice Cassidy’s ranch.

763
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,570
But if you want the whole gang,

764
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:47,540
your best bet is to find
them at the Hole in the Wall.

765
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,210
The Hole in the Wall.

766
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:53,410
That pass out there
in Big Horn mountains?

767
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:55,940
Yes, sir. I hear that’s
where the Wild Bunch meet up

768
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:58,180
after a robbery.

769
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:01,080
You’re likely to
find them all there.

770
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:02,850
That’s what I hear.

771
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,520
You know where that place is?

772
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:06,050
Yes, I do.

773
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,990
You know...

774
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:17,800
I don’t take kindly to the
law overlooking fugitives.

775
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:21,140
Butch Cassidy never created
no problems here, Mr. Siringo,

776
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,440
Never conducted no
illegal activities.

777
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:28,180
I would have locked
him up if he had.

778
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,350
I mean, in his defense...

779
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,680
he kind of helped
out around here.

780
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:36,580
Picking up a hammer
to fix a leaky roof

781
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:38,650
or give money to poor folk.

782
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:44,030
He never created no trouble
here in Dubois, I promise.

783
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:48,960
He sounds like a real saint.

784
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:55,470
Pick up that trash
off the street.

785
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:56,540
Yes, sir, I will.

786
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,480
Were those stories Alice was
telling embarrassing you?

787
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:07,520
Because they shouldn’t.
They’re cute.

788
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,720
No, it just makes you
miss Mike, is all.

789
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:15,120
Yeah, I miss my parents, too.

790
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:21,160
Why do you call them Mike and
Alice and not mom and dad?

791
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:23,000
They ain’t my real parents.

792
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,870
Ran away from home
when I was young,

793
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,900
and I met Mike when I got caught

794
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:32,040
stealing food from
the grocery store.

795
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:34,040
He offered to pay for it and

796
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:36,580
asked me if I wanted
a job on his ranch.

797
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:41,920
Kind of ended up being
like a father to me.

798
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,420
Guess they sort of adopted me.

799
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,590
Well, that’s mighty generous.

800
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:54,600
So you live alone?

801
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,100
I live with my man.

802
00:55:57,530 --> 00:55:58,770
Oh.

803
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,240
Where’s he at? When
do I get to meet him?

804
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,740
Well, he’s out of
town for a spell.

805
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:07,980
I don’t even know
if you’d like him.

806
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,180
Probably wouldn’t get along.

807
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,110
He’s different from
you, that’s for sure.

808
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:18,020
-How so?
-Well, he’s loud. Very loud.

809
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:21,460
And he dresses fancy.

810
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,920
Fancy?

811
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:25,360
Don’t seem like you’d be with
a kind of fella like that.

812
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,630
Yeah, well, I like fancy.

813
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,630
What about you?

814
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,570
-What about me?
-Why don’t you have a girl?

815
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:39,170
Yes. I guess I just
haven’t made time for it.

816
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,340
Maybe I haven’t met
the right one yet.

817
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,100
[panting]

818
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:15,310
I say we take our
chances and go in.

819
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:18,350
Patience, Mr. Horn. Patience.

820
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:22,220
-Hey, Maude? -Yeah, baby?

821
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,120
I’m through with patience.

822
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,260
[grunts]

823
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:40,740
You got him.

824
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,400
She’s still moving.

825
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:56,550
Hole in the Wall. I heard
stories about this place.

826
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:59,890
Yeah, it looks like someone
was here, but left in a hurry.

827
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:02,590
Yeah, who knows?

828
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:05,560
Gunshots look like they
echoed pretty good in here.

829
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:07,800
I should have
thought about that.

830
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,670
Who is she?

831
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:18,040
This is Maude Davis,
the woman to the now

832
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:21,140
deceased William
"Elzy" Ellsworth here.

833
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:22,580
[Maude groans]

834
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:27,350
She’s not going to make it.

835
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:39,260
Now we have to find
this Alice Cassidy.

836
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:44,400
How do you wish to proceed?

837
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:46,200
With extreme caution.

838
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:02,250
Butch... Butch!

839
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,450
I got a visit from

840
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,890
the U.S. Marshal’s
Office this morning.

841
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:09,820
They said Mike owes
years of back taxes

842
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:13,060
and they’re going to seize
the ranch for payment.

843
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:15,800
I can’t lose his ranch. I can’t.

844
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,676
Nobody’s going to take
your ranch from you, Alice.

845
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,230
All right? What’s all this?

846
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,640
It’s all them papers
they handed me

847
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:25,910
about how Mike owes the
state money and such.

848
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:32,080
I can’t understand
all this law talk.

849
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:35,380
Is Etta around? Maybe she can
make some sense out of it.

850
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:37,520
No, I ain’t seen
her in a few days.

851
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:40,320
I don’t know what
I’m going to do.

852
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:43,290
Go see Fred at the bank.

853
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,960
He’ll know what to
do. He always does.

854
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:49,900
Maybe it’s too soon for
you to go back into town.

855
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,830
You let me worry about that.

856
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:54,970
I’m a mother, I worry
about everything.

857
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:18,890
Hello, Alice.

858
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,560
Hello, Fred. So nice
to see you again.

859
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:23,230
Mr. Maxwell. What’s
all this about?

860
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,646
Alice has a little
paperwork problem

861
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:25,870
she’d like you to look at.

862
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:27,570
Let me see what you got.

863
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:33,370
Our government at times
can be so perverse.

864
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,880
Robbing a widow of
all she has left.

865
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:36,940
It’s despicable.

866
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:42,280
And there you go.

867
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:44,550
These papers officially
state that all

868
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:46,690
back taxes have
been paid in full.

869
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:50,630
But I didn’t pay you anything.

870
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:53,860
These papers say you
did. Right there.

871
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:56,700
But somehow the funds were lost

872
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,400
in transit to the
governor’s office.

873
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:04,010
But that’s not what happened.

874
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:05,710
It won’t be a problem.

875
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:07,940
You and Mike have
been customers here

876
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:10,750
since I was a kid,
sweeping up the floors.

877
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:13,750
You deserve to live
out life peacefully

878
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:17,020
and not be constrained by
our money-hungry government.

879
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,490
Thank you, Fred.

880
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,940
Hands where I can see them.

881
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:16,880
Make a move with your gun,

882
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:19,580
it’ll be the last thing
you do, I assure you.

883
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:24,520
Place it on the table
for me, won’t you?

884
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:33,390
Do I know you?

885
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,130
Nope.

886
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:42,140
I heard a story about a man once

887
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:45,510
carved a combination to
a safe into his pistol.

888
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:46,840
You know something about that?

889
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,510
I reckon a lot of men done
that one time or another.

890
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:57,490
Ooh, careful now.

891
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:59,850
Our government will
take you for everything.

892
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,060
Howdy, señor.

893
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:06,806
Would you mind filling
up a bag for me, please?

894
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:08,400
You know what? Make it two.

895
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:11,730
Oh, and go easy on the coins,
would you? They get heavy.

896
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,370
What are you looking at?

897
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,970
Your bank’s getting robbed.

898
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:24,350
Thank you very much, sir.

899
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:26,310
Have yourself a nice
rest of your day.

900
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:30,680
And as for the rest of you,
have yourself a good day, too.

901
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:34,660
It is a beautiful day
outside. The sun is shining.

902
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,560
It’s good to be alive.

903
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:50,000
Whoo!

904
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:51,840
That was exciting.

905
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:55,410
Well, I do have a
claim to file now.

906
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,180
And alert the sheriff.

907
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:01,050
And those back property
taxes you’ve paid,

908
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:03,380
they were just stolen.

909
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:06,090
You see? Everything works out.

910
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:11,960
Thank you for taking
me to see Fred.

911
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:15,800
He’s always been
such a nice man.

912
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:19,230
Are you sure you didn’t know
who that bank robber was?

913
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:20,970
No, never seen him before.

914
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:28,110
Are you okay?

915
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:31,350
Go get on your
horse and ride home.

916
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:32,650
I’ll catch up to you.

917
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:33,980
What is it?

918
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,590
Trouble.

919
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:39,120
You be safe.

920
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:15,620
Hands up.

921
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:17,020
Hold it right there.

922
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:22,130
That’s far enough.

923
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,240
You’re that fella that
robbed that bank, ain’t you?

924
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:27,800
Why are you following me?

925
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:30,840
Would you believe me if I
said I wasn’t following you?

926
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:32,970
No, sir, I would not.

927
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,656
You really ought to think
about removing those

928
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,080
numbers from your
gun, Butch Cassidy.

929
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:42,680
You told my girl your
name was Robert Parker.

930
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:45,120
Who’s your girl?

931
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:46,190
Etta Place.

932
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,036
Should have used that other
name you throw around.

933
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:54,330
What is it? Maxwell Sanchez.

934
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:57,130
I’m Harry Longbaugh.

935
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,830
You can call me
Sundance. Sundance Kid.

936
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:05,070
I know I’m not as famous as
you yet, but I aim to be.

937
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,840
I have some information to
give you. It’s important.

938
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:13,810
But first, would you mind
putting that gun down?

939
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,220
I can be a lot more useful
to you alive than dead.

940
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,960
Thank you.

941
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:25,730
Well, what do you
got to tell me?

942
01:06:25,790 --> 01:06:29,200
I have been told from
a reliable source

943
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:32,870
that the Pinkerton Detective
Agency is looking for you.

944
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:35,400
Fellow by the name
of Charlie Siringo

945
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:38,870
and a no good gun for hire,
Tom Horn out of Cheyenne.

946
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:42,010
-You heard of them?
-Yeah, who hasn’t?

947
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:45,210
Word is Siringo and
Horn killed Elzy Lay and

948
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,080
Maude Davis at the
Hole in the Wall.

949
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:49,620
Who told you all this?

950
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,450
There’s an old fella in
the town of Cody keeps me

951
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,790
informed of things,
seeing as how the town

952
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:56,460
is just yonder of
the Hole in the Wall.

953
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:59,060
And I’m sorry to
keep on as such,

954
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:00,566
but I don’t know if you
heard about what they did

955
01:07:00,590 --> 01:07:02,700
to Isom back in Dubois.

956
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,130
What about Isom?

957
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,030
Siringo and Horn dragged
him out of his cell

958
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:09,770
asking questions about you.

959
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,910
Isom wouldn’t give anything up.

960
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:14,040
Horn shot him dead. Cold blood.

961
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:20,210
Heard old Bob Meeks
had a hand in it, too.

962
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:23,150
Bob Meeks? You sure about that?

963
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:26,720
From what I hear, he
handed Isom right to him.

964
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:34,090
You’ve been so holed up
with your new ranch life,

965
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,730
you don’t even know
what’s going on

966
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,040
out there in the world, do you?

967
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,940
You need to be looking over your
shoulder from now on, Butch.

968
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,970
But if you need anything,

969
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,140
you know where to
find Etta and me.

970
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:48,910
Alice.

971
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:18,870
Mrs. Cassidy.

972
01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:30,580
Is there by any chance,
anyone with you?

973
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:32,820
If you’re with the
U.S. Marshal’s office,

974
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:36,620
I got the paperwork there.

975
01:08:36,690 --> 01:08:39,990
Now leave me alone. You
ain’t taking my land.

976
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:43,160
We’re not here about
your land, ma’am.

977
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:46,400
We’re with the Pinkerton
Detective Agency

978
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:49,670
and we’re looking
for a known fugitive.

979
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:51,270
[gasps]

980
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:56,440
A fugitive we were told by
a reliable source was here.

981
01:08:57,540 --> 01:08:58,710
Who?

982
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:00,210
Butch.

983
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:03,380
Cassidy.

984
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:09,220
Butch Cassidy, the bank robber?

985
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:14,390
Same last name, gentlemen,
but no relation.

986
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:17,260
Yes, yes, we know that,

987
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:21,030
but are you expecting
him anytime soon?

988
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:23,000
I don’t. Why would I?

989
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:24,910
Then tell us where
we can find him.

990
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:29,610
I think I already
answered that question.

991
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:32,250
Mrs. Cassidy...

992
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:35,120
Just tell us where we
can find him, ma’am,

993
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:36,650
and we’ll be on our way.

994
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:37,850
Don’t...

995
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:41,590
Please don’t make
this difficult.

996
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:46,360
Is this what you
detectives do now?

997
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:48,630
Come into little
old ladies homes,

998
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:52,270
a huffing and a puffing
and making up stories

999
01:09:52,330 --> 01:09:55,000
that make you feel bigger
than you really are?

1000
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:01,880
Huffing and puffing.

1001
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:06,980
Have you ever heard of a man

1002
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:10,620
named Elmer McCurdy,
Mrs. Cassidy?

1003
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:16,190
No, I ain’t heard of
him neither. Excuse me.

1004
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:20,460
Would either one
of you gentlemen

1005
01:10:20,530 --> 01:10:22,660
like some tea or coffee?

1006
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:24,430
No, ma’am.

1007
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:27,130
Coffee, Please.

1008
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,840
Well, truth be told,

1009
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:31,470
I’d be surprised if you
said you had heard of him.

1010
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:37,310
Elma McCurdy was a lowlife
bank and train robber,

1011
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:40,210
much like your Butch, in fact.

1012
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,480
Though not nearly as well known.

1013
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:48,490
And as is the usual fate of men
in McCurdy’s chosen profession,

1014
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:53,560
the day came that he was
shot down in the street

1015
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:59,370
like a rabid dog in a violent
gunfight with the law.

1016
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:02,640
Justice served.

1017
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,440
Then the strangest
thing happened.

1018
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:10,680
A man arrived in
town professing to be

1019
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:14,110
McCurdy’s long lost brother.

1020
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:17,990
Identified him as
such, claimed the body.

1021
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:20,490
Took it away.

1022
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:25,130
Ah, but it was soon
learned that man had lied

1023
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:29,200
because, in fact,
McCurdy had no brother.

1024
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:34,300
And that stranger,
he was, in fact...

1025
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:40,070
the owner of a little
traveling carnival show.

1026
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:45,880
You know, the kind that
likes to put on display

1027
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:49,750
dead outlaw’s mummified remains.

1028
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:54,890
Gruesome business, but
no doubt a profitable one

1029
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,290
for that little traveling show.

1030
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:01,760
But as a mother, I’m
sure you’ll agree,

1031
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:06,570
such an undignified end to the
life of young Elmer McCurdy.

1032
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:11,810
I cannot imagine how...

1033
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:15,710
ashamed and heartbroken

1034
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:17,880
his mother must have been

1035
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:20,650
when she found out
about all that.

1036
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:24,320
Tell me, Mrs. Cassidy,

1037
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:29,420
do you like.
carnival attractions?

1038
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,390
No,

1039
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:36,630
I don’t.

1040
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:39,200
Ah!

1041
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:47,770
Now, if you’ll
excuse me, gentlemen.

1042
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:53,350
Mr. Horn.

1043
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:03,320
[gunshot]

1044
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:33,320
Oh!

1045
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:37,590
Alice! Alice! Are you all right?

1046
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:38,730
What happened?

1047
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:44,060
This is all my fault.

1048
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:48,240
No...

1049
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:58,180
I love you with all my heart.

1050
01:15:46,390 --> 01:15:48,790
Hey. Who’s there?

1051
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:52,690
Answer me.

1052
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,800
Show yourself.

1053
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:08,810
Mike?

1054
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,580
I watched you die
out there, Mike.

1055
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:15,980
I get that, son.

1056
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:18,420
And you better get this.

1057
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:22,660
Charlie Siringo didn’t
want me. He wanted you.

1058
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:26,090
Alice never forgave herself
for not stopping you that day.

1059
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,660
Not stopping the both of us.

1060
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:31,830
Her thinking that
you were dead...

1061
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:35,670
I watched her die a little
bit every single day.

1062
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:36,740
Blaming herself.

1063
01:16:36,770 --> 01:16:40,870
And laying on the
street dying, almost...

1064
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:43,240
bleeding.

1065
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:46,680
I was sharp enough
to give him an alias

1066
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:51,520
so he couldn’t track
me back to you and her.

1067
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:54,220
I’m not sure they believe me.

1068
01:16:54,290 --> 01:16:55,760
They didn’t think
I was reliable.

1069
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:58,960
So you know what they
did? Lock him up.

1070
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:03,960
Put him in the goddamn prison.
Five years. I did my time, son.

1071
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:07,430
Three weeks ago,
they let me out.

1072
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:12,270
I was still afraid that Siringo

1073
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:14,910
would follow me to you.

1074
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:17,540
Siringo still killed
Alice, didn’t he?

1075
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:20,650
Yes.

1076
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:26,690
So why are you here now?

1077
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:31,960
I regretted never being
able to go back to her.

1078
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:33,730
To hold her, to comfort her.

1079
01:17:33,790 --> 01:17:38,400
I let her down. That’s on me.

1080
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:44,040
You still ain’t
answered my question.

1081
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:46,810
Why are you here?

1082
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:51,110
You’re the same kid as you
were when you were real young.

1083
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:52,980
Turd-headed big time.

1084
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:55,150
You can get it done.

1085
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:57,280
You still in love with that.

1086
01:17:57,350 --> 01:18:00,290
That’ll get you
one day or another.

1087
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:02,420
You go after
Siringo by yourself,

1088
01:18:02,490 --> 01:18:03,890
you know what’s going to happen?

1089
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,506
You’re going to end up
just exactly like me.

1090
01:18:05,530 --> 01:18:07,990
You’ll be in prison.
You’ll do time.

1091
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,230
And if that doesn’t happen,

1092
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:15,600
he will find you and
you will be dead.

1093
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,770
That’s a chance I’m
willing to take.

1094
01:18:20,310 --> 01:18:21,810
So are you with me or not?

1095
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:28,180
No, son. I’m not.

1096
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:30,350
You’re going to let
them get away with it?

1097
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:34,390
They took Alice from us.

1098
01:18:34,450 --> 01:18:36,260
Yes, they did.

1099
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,130
I’ll handle it again myself.

1100
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:40,890
Just like I did in Sweetwater.

1101
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:58,140
Who’s there?

1102
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:05,020
Reckon I might find you here.

1103
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:08,690
Where’s Ben and Laura?

1104
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:10,490
Away.

1105
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:14,690
Who’s that there?

1106
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:18,030
Some fellow thought
he could cross me.

1107
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:20,930
A couple of Pinkerton
detectives are looking for us.

1108
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,140
Ain’t nothing can’t be handled.

1109
01:19:25,210 --> 01:19:26,646
I wanted to see if
you and the others

1110
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:28,880
were up for another job.

1111
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:31,080
Yeah, like last time
with your pal, Bob?

1112
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:32,450
No, thank you.

1113
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:34,010
Siringo and Horn
are coming for us

1114
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:37,080
and they ain’t going to
stop until they kill us.

1115
01:19:37,150 --> 01:19:39,520
I say we get to them first.

1116
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:42,490
Rob the Southern
Rail down in Folsom.

1117
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:45,090
Ambush and kill them
at the same time.

1118
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,730
What happened to
your no killing rule?

1119
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:52,530
They tortured Isom
before killing him.

1120
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:56,070
Bob Meeks had a
hand in that too.

1121
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:58,410
Where did you hear this?

1122
01:19:58,470 --> 01:20:01,640
Outlaw I ran into.
Calls himself Sundance.

1123
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:03,310
Never heard of him.

1124
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:06,480
They killed Elzy and
Maude. They murdered Alice.

1125
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:11,520
They killed Alice?

1126
01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:16,990
They left a note telling me
that I couldn’t hide from ’em

1127
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:20,190
and I’m gonna kill ’em
with or without you.

1128
01:20:20,260 --> 01:20:21,660
Let me see your gun.

1129
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:39,150
So you really got it
in you to do this?

1130
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:41,180
I’ve never raised my
gun to kill a man,

1131
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:45,020
but I’d shoot the devil
between the eyes if I could.

1132
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:48,220
The Great Train robber Butch
Cassidy out for revenge.

1133
01:20:48,290 --> 01:20:50,520
I like that.

1134
01:20:50,590 --> 01:20:54,160
You can’t let them get away
for what they did to Alice.

1135
01:20:54,230 --> 01:20:55,436
But how do you
know they’re going

1136
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:57,360
to show up at the train station?

1137
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:59,730
There’s a banker at the
Wyoming National Bank

1138
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:03,300
in Dubois, handled all of
Mike and Alice’s affairs.

1139
01:21:03,370 --> 01:21:05,170
Mine, too. Fred.

1140
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,210
He’s a good man.

1141
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:10,040
He won’t readily give
anything up to him,

1142
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:12,480
but we’ve all heard
of Horn’s methods

1143
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:15,110
on getting fellows to talk.

1144
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:17,250
Except for Isom.

1145
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:19,790
So how do you know they’re
going to go to the bank?

1146
01:21:19,850 --> 01:21:22,120
Because that note they left me

1147
01:21:22,190 --> 01:21:25,990
written on one of Alice’s
property papers from the bank.

1148
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:29,930
Fred gives up the location of my
ranch, which he definitely will,

1149
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,636
I’ll make sure to leave
something there for them

1150
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:33,970
that’ll lead them
straight to Folsom.

1151
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:39,170
Whether they show up or not,
you can have all the money.

1152
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,410
All right.

1153
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:48,210
You let him go, let’s
you and I get to it.

1154
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,580
He ain’t going nowhere.
He’s counting worms.

1155
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,820
Come on, I’ll take you to them.

1156
01:22:06,430 --> 01:22:08,100
[grunts]

1157
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:18,850
Please. I don’t understand.
What have I done, detectives?

1158
01:22:23,650 --> 01:22:25,590
Is that blood?

1159
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:28,660
Now Butch Cassidy

1160
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:31,220
came into your bank here

1161
01:22:31,290 --> 01:22:32,730
with Alice Cassidy,

1162
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:35,930
and they had you
forge that document.

1163
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,530
I’m sorry. He threatened me.

1164
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:39,776
-I was afraid he was... -[thud]

1165
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,530
Ah! I was afraid he
was going to kill me.

1166
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,700
That’s not the way he works.

1167
01:22:43,770 --> 01:22:45,970
You and I both know
that, don’t we?

1168
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:51,410
Now, you’re not in trouble
for the forged document.

1169
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:56,020
You sold some land at
Butch Cassidy a while back.

1170
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,920
I did. But that was a
perfectly legal transaction.

1171
01:22:58,990 --> 01:23:00,220
Where’s it located?

1172
01:23:03,490 --> 01:23:07,290
Where the road comes to a fork.

1173
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:10,100
Alice Cassidy’s house is on
the eastern trail, right?

1174
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:15,100
So, Butch Cassidy’s
house is off the western.

1175
01:23:15,170 --> 01:23:17,300
It’s called the Bartlet Ranch.

1176
01:23:17,370 --> 01:23:21,410
You follow the western trail
around down through some

1177
01:23:21,470 --> 01:23:24,140
small hills, and it sits at
the base amongst the trees.

1178
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,680
It’s a small house.

1179
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:29,250
You can’t miss it.

1180
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,350
You wouldn’t lie
to us, would you?

1181
01:23:33,650 --> 01:23:36,890
No, sir. Absolutely not.

1182
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,960
I would consider
him a friend, but...

1183
01:23:40,330 --> 01:23:42,930
Sometimes you have to think
about yourself, right?

1184
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,600
One last thing, sir.

1185
01:23:45,670 --> 01:23:48,970
Do you happen to
know if Butch Cassidy

1186
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:52,940
has any company right now?

1187
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:56,840
Every time I’ve seen
him, he’s always

1188
01:23:56,910 --> 01:23:59,210
been in the presence of Alice.

1189
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:02,420
Sirs...

1190
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:06,890
Whose blood is on the paper?

1191
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:09,290
Just be thankful
that it isn’t yours.

1192
01:24:11,490 --> 01:24:12,890
Appreciate your help.

1193
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:24,600
We riding out to
Cassidy’s place?

1194
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:26,210
Not just yet.

1195
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:29,210
Let’s pay a little
visit to Sheriff Beck.

1196
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:32,910
See if he and his men
can atone for their sins.

1197
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,490
Please, don’t shoot.

1198
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:46,490
Not to worry, ma’am.
We mean you no harm.

1199
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:50,060
We’re looking for a known
fugitive. Butch Cassidy.

1200
01:24:50,130 --> 01:24:54,100
This... This is his
residence, is it not?

1201
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:57,570
Robert Parker lives here.

1202
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:01,010
Mr. Parker and Mr. Cassidy
are one and the same.

1203
01:25:02,810 --> 01:25:05,710
I did not know that.

1204
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:08,510
-So is he inside? -No, he’s not.

1205
01:25:11,850 --> 01:25:13,490
Move aside, ma’am.

1206
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:16,360
Step down for me.

1207
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,560
What is your name?

1208
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:26,930
Ethel. Ethel Porter.

1209
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:31,500
You don’t mind me asking, what
is your relationship to Butch?

1210
01:25:31,570 --> 01:25:34,040
Or should I say Mr. Parker.

1211
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:38,540
House is empty.

1212
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,450
Your relationship, ma’am?

1213
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:46,650
He’s my neighbor.
I live over yonder.

1214
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,220
We met a while back.

1215
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:51,990
He asked me to look in on
the place and tidy up a bit.

1216
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:53,790
And do his laundry?

1217
01:25:55,190 --> 01:25:57,230
That’s neighborly of you.

1218
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:01,200
Did he happen to
mention where he went?

1219
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:03,740
He was riding on down to Folsom

1220
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,240
to meet up with
some old friends.

1221
01:26:07,810 --> 01:26:09,340
Don’t move.

1222
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:15,550
-Do you believe her? -I do.

1223
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:18,450
Only because the
Southern Pacific Railroad

1224
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:21,950
stops there to
distribute payroll.

1225
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:24,720
To the rail construction sites.

1226
01:26:24,790 --> 01:26:27,230
That would be a
big take for them.

1227
01:26:27,290 --> 01:26:30,960
And she mentioned he was
meeting up with old friends.

1228
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,700
It could be Curry and his crew.

1229
01:26:33,770 --> 01:26:35,330
Very well could be.

1230
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:38,470
Which means we’re going
to need a little help.

1231
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:43,580
Am I in trouble, sirs?

1232
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:44,910
No, ma’am, you’re not.

1233
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:47,010
Thank you for the information.

1234
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:52,320
Oh, just a little suggestion.

1235
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:58,520
I strongly advise you not to
fraternize with no criminals.

1236
01:26:58,590 --> 01:27:03,600
It’s not particularly
good for your health.

1237
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,300
Good day.

1238
01:27:14,610 --> 01:27:16,310
[chuckles]

1239
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:45,070
Looks like they fell for it.

1240
01:27:47,610 --> 01:27:48,670
You okay, darlin’?

1241
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:50,540
Yeah.

1242
01:27:50,610 --> 01:27:52,610
Come here, come here.

1243
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:53,680
I’m here.

1244
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:56,380
I’m here. What happened?

1245
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:03,020
I for sure thought
Butch was wrong about

1246
01:28:03,090 --> 01:28:05,360
two lawmen killing
Alice Cassidy, but...

1247
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:08,830
Now I believe him.

1248
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:10,430
Yeah, and they’re gonna get

1249
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:13,570
what’s coming to
’em, I promise you.

1250
01:28:13,630 --> 01:28:16,200
But now I got to go saddle
up and let Butch know

1251
01:28:16,270 --> 01:28:19,810
- they’re on their way.
- I don’t want you to go.

1252
01:28:19,870 --> 01:28:22,910
-Why? -I just don’t trust it.

1253
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:25,610
You wanted me to help Butch
out in the first place.

1254
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:28,810
I know, I know, but
you didn’t see them.

1255
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,420
They have a devil in their eyes.

1256
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:34,220
I’ve seen them. I’ve seen them.

1257
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:39,060
I just don’t...

1258
01:28:39,130 --> 01:28:41,570
I don’t want you getting killed
over his personal vendetta...

1259
01:28:42,930 --> 01:28:46,700
No matter how wrong it was
them killing Alice Cassidy.

1260
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,370
I just don’t trust it.

1261
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:52,000
I know. I know you don’t.

1262
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:56,580
But I’m not a fan of
giving someone my word

1263
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:59,250
and not following
through on it, Etta.

1264
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:03,080
We may need his help one day.

1265
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:09,190
I’ll come back to you.

1266
01:29:11,490 --> 01:29:14,030
[bell ringing]

1267
01:29:19,630 --> 01:29:20,630
Bank guards.

1268
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:22,270
Yeah, I see ’em.

1269
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:24,100
I don’t see Sundance.

1270
01:29:25,710 --> 01:29:26,870
Don’t need him, anyway.

1271
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:28,546
Horn and Siringo show,
there’s four of us.

1272
01:29:28,570 --> 01:29:30,380
I like them odds.

1273
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:34,210
That’s a good score.

1274
01:29:40,490 --> 01:29:42,120
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

1275
01:29:44,290 --> 01:29:45,490
We’ll take it from here.

1276
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:53,230
I’d drop those guns to
the ground. Nice and slow.

1277
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:54,570
Nice and slow.

1278
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:56,800
Good.

1279
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:01,310
Get out of here.

1280
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:05,310
[laughing]

1281
01:30:06,950 --> 01:30:08,810
Ooh-wee.

1282
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:14,820
Where are these Pinkertons?

1283
01:30:14,890 --> 01:30:16,596
If they ain’t here by the
time that money’s loaded up,

1284
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:18,320
Butch, you’re on your own.

1285
01:30:18,390 --> 01:30:20,390
We’re here for the money.
You’re here for revenge.

1286
01:30:25,970 --> 01:30:27,770
[trains whistle blows]

1287
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:35,980
[grunts]

1288
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:37,640
This is heavy.

1289
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:52,290
[gunfire]

1290
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:10,710
[horse whinnies]

1291
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:13,610
[grunts]

1292
01:31:27,790 --> 01:31:28,890
Whoa.

1293
01:31:33,870 --> 01:31:36,240
[gunfire continues]

1294
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:02,760
[grunts]

1295
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,250
Ah!

1296
01:32:20,310 --> 01:32:21,850
I’ve been shot!

1297
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:28,520
Get over here.

1298
01:32:33,490 --> 01:32:35,360
Die, you son of a bitch.

1299
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:36,900
-No. -What are you doing?

1300
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,600
I told you I want him alive.

1301
01:32:38,660 --> 01:32:40,730
You shoot that girl, you’re
going to jail with ’em.

1302
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,330
Do you understand me, Mr. Horn?

1303
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:44,440
Drop that gun or
I’ll put a bullet

1304
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:45,670
in this little girl’s head.

1305
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:47,840
Put ’em down.

1306
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:49,380
Son of a bitch.

1307
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:53,710
Butch!

1308
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:56,350
He’s not gonna shoot.

1309
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:07,490
-[grunting] -Butch!

1310
01:33:15,830 --> 01:33:17,770
[laughing]

1311
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:18,840
Don’t you do it.

1312
01:33:21,110 --> 01:33:23,010
Don’t!

1313
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:24,680
Oh, shit!

1314
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:29,950
I got him. I got him.

1315
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:35,920
Butch, get out of here, go.

1316
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:38,190
I ain’t leaving you.

1317
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:41,160
You’re worth more to us
alive than dead, Butch.

1318
01:33:41,230 --> 01:33:42,390
We’ll get ’em another day.

1319
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:44,530
-Go. -I ain’t leaving you.

1320
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:46,800
Go on. Get.

1321
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:48,870
-Go! -Go.

1322
01:33:50,570 --> 01:33:52,370
I’ll draw him away
from us, all right?

1323
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:59,680
[groans]

1324
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:01,550
No, I’ll handle this.

1325
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:07,420
[gunfire]

1326
01:34:14,660 --> 01:34:17,400
Take that hand off your
wound and raise it up.

1327
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:24,570
Do you think you can get it?

1328
01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:30,440
Get your back up
against the wall.

1329
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:33,080
Now get.

1330
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:40,450
Sheriff Beck,
retrieve their guns.

1331
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:51,530
- What about these three?
- They’re not going anywhere.

1332
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,800
Sheriff Beck, watch
them, if you please.

1333
01:35:09,650 --> 01:35:10,850
Where the hell were you?

1334
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:11,850
With Etta.

1335
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,650
-Is she okay? -She’s fine.

1336
01:35:15,850 --> 01:35:16,860
[gunshot]

1337
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,360
Ah!

1338
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:24,630
-I got him. -They shot me.

1339
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:26,400
Come on. Come on. Get up.

1340
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:28,930
Well, well, well.

1341
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,840
Look at this. This is
a most prosperous day.

1342
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:34,570
Two of the most dangerous
outlaws in the West

1343
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:37,010
at the same time.

1344
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:38,616
Only difference between
the two of you and us

1345
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:40,510
is them fake badges you wear.

1346
01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:42,780
Tie them up, Mr. Horn.

1347
01:35:42,850 --> 01:35:45,380
-Give me your hands. -Stop.

1348
01:35:46,620 --> 01:35:48,350
Holster that gun, Mr. Siringo.

1349
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:50,090
Or you’re a dead man.

1350
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:52,490
Oh, you wouldn’t like
her when she’s mad.

1351
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:58,660
Drop them, boys.

1352
01:36:03,770 --> 01:36:06,370
Thought you two could
need a little help.

1353
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:08,440
Turns out I was right.

1354
01:36:08,510 --> 01:36:10,240
That’s my girl.

1355
01:36:10,310 --> 01:36:12,340
I told you she was lying to us.

1356
01:36:12,410 --> 01:36:14,110
I heard about your
methods, Horn.

1357
01:36:15,350 --> 01:36:16,850
Is it you who killed Alice?

1358
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:20,620
Yes.

1359
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:25,560
But if it’s any
consolation to you,

1360
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:28,330
at least she died
with some dignity.

1361
01:36:28,390 --> 01:36:31,460
Unlike your yellow
belly friends.

1362
01:36:31,530 --> 01:36:35,500
Ellsworth, Maude and Isom Dart.

1363
01:36:35,570 --> 01:36:36,870
She was shot in the back.

1364
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,970
What difference does it make?

1365
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:41,740
She was just
another filthy whore

1366
01:36:41,810 --> 01:36:44,480
that had what was coming to her.

1367
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:58,960
Well, so much for the legend
that you never killed a man.

1368
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:02,060
Now question is, what do we do
with Detective Siringo here?

1369
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,670
Is it true what Horn said?

1370
01:37:06,730 --> 01:37:07,746
You didn’t have
nothing to do with

1371
01:37:07,770 --> 01:37:09,300
killing Alice or them others?

1372
01:37:09,370 --> 01:37:10,840
Don’t matter, Butch.

1373
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:13,310
He used Horn. He’s
got just as much blood

1374
01:37:13,370 --> 01:37:17,040
on his hands even if he
didn’t pull the trigger.

1375
01:37:17,110 --> 01:37:18,656
I say we kill him right
now and be done with it.

1376
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:20,680
No, no, no.

1377
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:22,410
Take off your belt, Mr. Siringo.

1378
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:24,450
-Nice and slow. -What? Why?

1379
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:26,820
-Then what? -We tie him up.

1380
01:37:26,890 --> 01:37:28,090
And then what, Butch?

1381
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:39,800
What the hell did you do?

1382
01:37:39,870 --> 01:37:42,600
He’s going for his holdout gun.

1383
01:37:42,670 --> 01:37:44,100
It was either us or them, Butch.

1384
01:37:44,170 --> 01:37:46,100
And good damn riddance.

1385
01:37:46,170 --> 01:37:48,040
Nothing but a bunch
of filthy cockroaches.

1386
01:37:48,110 --> 01:37:49,210
The both of them.

1387
01:37:49,270 --> 01:37:51,210
He’s a Pinkerton
detective, Sundance.

1388
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:54,210
Only gonna have more
coming looking for us now.

1389
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:56,350
Well, then we better get
going now, shouldn’t we?

1390
01:37:56,420 --> 01:37:58,350
What about all that money
from the Folsom train?

1391
01:37:58,420 --> 01:38:00,820
Back at the station.

1392
01:38:00,890 --> 01:38:03,020
You didn’t even
get the damn loot?

1393
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:05,166
There’s no way I could have
loaded it up on my horse,

1394
01:38:05,190 --> 01:38:07,490
all them bullets flying.

1395
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:11,300
Well, it’d be kind of a shame
to leave all that money behind.

1396
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:14,230
We can go back and get it.

1397
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:15,700
Now we’re making sense.

1398
01:38:18,870 --> 01:38:20,910
Thank you for saving
the day, darling.

1399
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:40,560
Whoa.

1400
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:47,200
Put that down.

1401
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,770
I’m sorry.

1402
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,710
Charlie Siringo threatened
to kill all of us

1403
01:38:57,780 --> 01:38:58,940
if we didn’t help him.

1404
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:15,360
You go on and get out of here.
Make sure I don’t see you again.

1405
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,740
Didn’t think you’d
come back for us.

1406
01:39:28,940 --> 01:39:30,080
Yeah, I came back.

1407
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:32,740
Let’s get you on
our of here now.

1408
01:39:32,810 --> 01:39:34,056
Let’s get out share of
the loot and split up

1409
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:36,080
before any more of
the law shows up.

1410
01:39:39,990 --> 01:39:42,150
What about Siringo and Horn?

1411
01:39:42,220 --> 01:39:43,460
Counting worms.

1412
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,790
Killed ’em?

1413
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:47,890
You don’t got to worry
about them no more.

1414
01:40:07,410 --> 01:40:09,150
Your take.

1415
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:14,450
What? That’s it?

1416
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:18,160
Come on, fellas. The three of
us make a pretty good bunch.

1417
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:21,290
Yeah, I reckon.

1418
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:24,360
Did you want to come with me?

1419
01:40:26,570 --> 01:40:29,170
I mean, it’s not a bad idea.

1420
01:40:29,230 --> 01:40:30,570
It’s only a matter of time

1421
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:32,270
before the law comes
looking for us.

1422
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:33,540
Yeah.

1423
01:40:33,610 --> 01:40:35,510
They’re going to find
our home sooner or later.

1424
01:40:35,570 --> 01:40:36,980
True.

1425
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:40,450
They might even be waiting
for us when we get back.

1426
01:40:43,250 --> 01:40:44,980
This ain’t going
to get us too far.

1427
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:47,190
Yeah, we’ll probably have

1428
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:49,350
to pull a few more
jobs along the way.

1429
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:53,060
You up for it?

1430
01:40:56,630 --> 01:40:58,500
Oh, yeah.

1431
01:40:58,560 --> 01:40:59,900
Well, you know I’m in.

1432
01:41:01,830 --> 01:41:03,300
Let’s ride.
