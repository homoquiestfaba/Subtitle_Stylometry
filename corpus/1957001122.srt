(Flash bulb popping)

00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,759
(Flash bulb popping)

4
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,517
(Flash bulb popping)

5
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,521
(Telephone rings)

6
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,029
(Telephone rings)

7
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,370
(And rings)

8
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,226
(Rings loudly)

9
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,420
(Answering machine picks up)

10
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,232
- [Woman] Good morning
Mr. Mochin, this is

11
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,217
the doctor's office.

12
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,487
Your test results
are in and we'd

13
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:43,324
like to see you right away.

14
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,409
We'Ve penciled you in for 12.

15
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,018
Please let US know
if that's a problem.

16
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,105
(Water running)

17
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,442
(Faucet shutting)

18
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:01,115
(Shufflng footsteps)

19
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,876
(Distant shoveling)

20
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:36,693
(Ambient industrial melody)

21
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,120
(Elevator button pressing)

22
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,018
(Loud crash)

23
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,436
-[Woman] Careful with that.

24
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,854
(Man laughing)

25
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,648
- [Woman] Stop laughing
like an imbecile

26
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,149
and put it in the corner.

27
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,759
(Telephone rings)

28
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,280
(Heels walk across floor)

29
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,823
(Man laughing)

30
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:06,657
-[Woman] Quiet.

31
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,640
(Elevator door opens)

32
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,184
-[Woman] Good morning, doctor.

33
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,437
Yes, of course.

34
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,315
He's just leaving now.

35
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:17,918
I understand.

36
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,736
(Train whistles by)

37
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,529
- [Shem] The soul,
as we'Ve explained,

38
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,532
permeates throughout
the entire body.

39
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:52,328
And yet an argument
regarding which of the limbs

40
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,372
serves as the soul's
primary location,

41
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:58,232
does exist between
the philosophers.

42
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:04,238
-[Bum] (Singing in
foreign language)

43
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,159
(Train horn)

44
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,264
- [Train conductor]
Next stop, braintree.

45
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,165
Braintree is next.

46
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:19,045
- [Older woman] Excuse me
dear, is this seat taken?

47
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,495
Such a glorious day.

48
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:38,165
Wonderful for a country
outing, is it not?

49
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,084
- Sorry?
- A private renedzvous

50
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,984
for two?

51
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:46,656
Perfect, just perfect.

52
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:52,412
But it is terribly
hot on this train.

53
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,517
I don't see how you can sit
there in that awful coat.

54
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,519
- I'm okay, thanks.

55
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,105
- But it's like a
Turkish bath in here.

56
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,256
- I'm fine, really.

57
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,091
-Well,

58
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,053
have it your way then.

59
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,931
(Train rolling on tracks)

60
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,496
- [Bum] (Laughing and singing)

61
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,084
I imagine you must be on route
to meet a sweetheart, yes?

62
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:26,213
A rendezvous for two, no?

63
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,489
- I have an appointment.

64
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,635
A doctor's appointment.

65
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,805
- A doctor? Oh dear.

66
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,432
It's nothing serious I hope.

67
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,643
- No, no it's just a
checkup, a routine checkup.

68
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:43,021
- Thank heavens, you
should never trust a

69
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:46,132
doctor when it comes
to something serious.

70
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,802
Most of them do go
to hell after all.

71
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,722
(Door creaks)

72
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,077
- The doctor will be with
you in just a minute.

73
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,145
Okay sweetie?

74
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,195
(Distorted tenebrous music)

75
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:22,251
(Music builds)

76
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,529
(Door opens)

77
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,181
- Well, let's see
what we have here.

78
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:41,872
So, this is your first
visit with US Mr. Mochin?

79
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,208
Wait a minute, mochin?

80
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,359
Not shem mochin?

81
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,253
(Laughs)

82
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,507
Well I'll be, it
is you. Man alive.

83
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,760
It's me.
Bentzi.

84
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,180
Bentzi spinowitz, the spinster.

85
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,891
- Bentzi, sure.
Hey.

86
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,518
- [Bentzi] Wow, this is some
surprise, it's been what,

87
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,561
like ten years?

88
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,146
- [Shem] Something like that.

89
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,421
- [Bentzi] So,

90
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,067
talk to me man, how you been?

91
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,986
Well, I guess I have the
answers to that little quiz.

92
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,571
But seriously, tell me
what you'Ve been up to.

93
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,157
Thought I heard something
about you becoming a rabbi?

94
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:20,643
- Yeah, I was studying but...

95
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,456
- Oh (chuckles), you married?

96
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,251
- No, no I'm not, are you?

97
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,253
- Maintaining my
mobility old friend.

98
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,837
I'm too young to give up on fun.

99
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,965
I like my lovin' on the go.

100
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,552
We should hand out sometime,
I know some sweet places.

101
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,787
Women that'll knock that
yamaka clear off your head.

102
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,455
(Heels clicking)

103
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,433
(Knocking on door)

104
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,227
- Sorry for interrupting
doctor but those packages

105
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,437
you were asking
about just arrived.

106
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,731
- Excellent, good, you
can just bring them on in.

107
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,173
- Of course.

108
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,222
- All right, let's
see what we have here.

109
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,644
- [Bentzi] Okay.

110
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,917
Do you mind if I ask you
something a little personal?

111
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,794
- I don't think so.

112
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:15,114
- Have you been somewhat
depressed lately?

113
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,467
- Lately?

114
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,595
- [Bentzi] How about work,
how's that been going?

115
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,763
- I'm not really
working at the moment.

116
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,640
- [Bentzi] So what
do you do all day?

117
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:28,228
- I don't know, I
read, study mostly.

118
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:32,256
- Tell me shem, are you active?

119
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,359
Sexually I mean.

120
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,761
(Heels clicking)

121
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,158
- I'm sorry bentzi,
but I really don't see

122
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,351
what this has to do with my leg.

123
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,622
- [Bentzi] Let me
put it this way shem.

124
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,874
We'Ve all experienced
this on some level, right?

125
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,251
Let's say someones holding a...

126
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:54,421
I don't know, a
fabergÃ© egg, right?

127
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,173
While holding the egg,
someone shocks them

128
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,425
with some really bad news,
heart wrenching stuff.

129
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,885
And all of the sudden
the hand just goes limp.

130
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:00,844
(Pen clanks on floor)

131
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,304
Lifeless.

132
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,056
The egg slips from the dead
flesh, shatters on the floor

133
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,350
like one damn expensive
humpty dumpty.

134
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,851
-A conversion reaction?

135
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,686
You're talking about
a conversion reaction.

136
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,979
- Exactly shem, that's just it.

137
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,273
Only in your case,
unlike in our example,

138
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,108
the hysterical
effects have lingered.

139
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,110
But now, for some
reason, the past is

140
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:20,471
rearing it's ugly head in
the guise of your dead leg.

141
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,098
(Heels clacking)

142
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:27,120
- This is crazy, I mean...

143
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,330
I've led...

144
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,541
My life has been fine, nothing
traumatic, nothing like that.

145
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,694
You know me, do I seem
hysterical to you?

146
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,839
- Look, shem, the truth is
I've never found much use

147
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,217
for this freudian
mumbo-jumbo myself.

148
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,011
It all smells of witch
doctoring and necromancy.

149
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,763
As far as I'm concerned,
your leg problems and all

150
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,224
these so called psychological
problems, they can all be

151
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,851
traced back to a
biological cause.

152
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:54,398
However, we physicians
face certain restrictions

153
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,899
and currently we have
neither the means nor

154
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,776
the equipment to perform
the necessary tests.

155
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,861
So, for the time being
anyway, I have no choice

156
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,614
but to categorize your
case a disease of the mind.

157
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,765
(Train rolling on tracks)

158
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,513
(Train rolling on tracks)

159
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:57,109
(High heels clicking)

160
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:12,958
(High heels approach)

161
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:27,389
(Train rumbles rythmically)

162
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,545
(Train whistles)

163
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,344
- [Train conductor] Ticket?

164
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,640
Your ticket, sir.

165
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,060
- Yes, of course, of course.

166
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:23,004
Just a moment, sorry I've
got it here somewhere.

167
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,197
- [Train conductor]
If you'd please, sir.

168
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,248
- I'm sorry but I
can't seem to find it.

169
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,977
- [Train conductor] A difficulty
that may be easily remedied

170
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,212
as you may purchase a
substitute ticket from me.

171
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,859
- Right, but here's the thing.

172
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:48,470
My wallet, where I'd been
keeping my ticket, is gone.

173
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,764
- [Train conductor] I see.

174
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,873
- There was a woman.

175
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,332
- [Train conductor] A woman?

176
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,544
- Yes, yes a woman, she was
sitting right over there.

177
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,962
You must have seen her.

178
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,214
My bag spilled over
near her feet.

179
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,382
- [Train conductor] The woman's?

180
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,093
- [Shem] Yes, the woman's or...

181
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:14,455
Wait, there was another.
- Another?

182
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,268
- [Shem] Yeah, an old
lady on the train earlier,

183
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,936
she held my coat.

184
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,190
- And this old woman you say,
absconded with your wallet?

185
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,133
- And my ticket.

186
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,099
(Train brakes screech)

187
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,190
(Crickets chirping)

188
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:46,320
(Cane banging)

189
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,881
(Car approaching)

190
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,093
- Hello.

191
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,012
- Well, howdy do stranga?

192
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,014

- Out for a bit of a stroll,

193
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,599

194
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,184
Nice night for it.

195
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,186
- Yeah, well actually i'm...
- [Man] Yep.

196
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,522
Used to walk up and
down this country road

197
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,191
just kicking stones
and bones, ya know?

198
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:52,696
Now they gimme this here
transport cause of my swollen feet.

199
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,573
Sure do envy you and
your walk, young fella.

200
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,659
- Would you like to trade?

201
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,369
- A trade?

202
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,204
Oh now I get it.

203
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,124
A trade.
How could we?

204
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,209
Unless you got some way
of trading up your youth.

205
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,670
- I just meant...
- Nope.

206
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,464
No way no how, can't
trade up your youth.

207
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:14,300
Would do nothin' about this
here swollen feet of mine.

208
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:17,077
(Laughs) Trade, I tell you.

209
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:21,081
Suppose you take the
missus off my hands too.

210
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,796
Wait a minute.

211
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,091
So that's your game, is it?
- [Shem] Game?

212
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,196
- You eyeballing
my old lady buddy?

213
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,657
You're one of them roadside
perverts, ain't you?

214
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,577
Yeah, that's what you are.

215
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:44,438
Huh, bet you like to cut em up
into little pieces, don't ya?

216
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,543
Like to hear em scream.
- No, god no.

217
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,046
I just need a lift,
I'm not some psycho.

218
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,529
I just...

219
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,283
I need some help.

220
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:03,475
- Easy there fella,
now that's different.

221
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,644
You need help, yep.

222
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:10,631
A stranger in need,
in need indeed.

223
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,984
What do ya think, sugar pie?

224
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,111
Should we help this
young fella out?

225
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,613
- I won't cause any trouble.

226
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,890
- Okay woman, I can handle it.

227
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:24,103
So, uh, where's ya headed?

228
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,147
(Car door dinging)

229
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,446
Name's Herman.

230
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,802
- Shem, shem.
Thanks Herman.

231
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:42,329
- Charmed, I'm sure.
Shit.

232
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,626
(Door slams)

233
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,046
(Car engine revs)

234
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,010
(Coffin rattles)

235
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,225
- [Herman] Tell me
something, stranga.

236
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,478
Why was you kicked
off that train?

237
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,731
- The train? Ummm.

238
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,128
Did I mention the train?

239
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,506
- [Herman] So you saying you
wasn't kicked off no train?

240
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,366
- No, I just meant that
I didn't get how you...

241
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,847
Look, my ticket
was stolen by some

242
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,664
woman who sat down next to me.

243
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,142
I'd never seen her
before and she...

244
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,936
- [Herman] You mean you say
you was robbed by a woman?

245
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,146
Shit.

246
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,064
- Well I can't
actually be sure but...

247
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,150
- [Herman] Ain't
that the end all?

248
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,402
I mean there ain't no justice.

249
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,697
There you was minding your
own business, am I right?

250
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:45,535
When some tramp waltzes in
and robs you blind and then

251
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,539
they go and throw you off like
you was some kind of vagrant.

252
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,541
Leave you to die like some...

253
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,609
What d'ya call them things?

254
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,361
No, that ain't it...

255
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,464
One of them...

256
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,508
(Man laughing)
(Water running) (Box creaking)

257
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,886
-[Herman] The shame of it all.
It's embarrassment.

258
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,179
-[Woman] Sweet.

259
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,723
(Film projector running)
(Box creaking)

260
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,748
(Woman breathing)

261
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,208
(Man laughing)

262
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,667
(Woman moaning)

263
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,544
(Loug bang)

264
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,217
(Shoveling)

265
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,596
(Dirt landing)

266
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,682
(Shoveling)

267
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,565
(Crickets chirping)

268
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,029
(Dog barking in distance)

269
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,247
(Foot dragging)

270
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,253
(Distant train horn)

271
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,384
(Foot dragging)

272
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:12,479
(Ambient industrial tones)

273
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,260
- [Bum] Hey, buddy.

274
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,202
Got any dough?

275
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,582
- No, sorry.
I lost my wallet.

276
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,043
(Feet dragging)

277
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,880
(Laughing)

278
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,429
- Sorry, I lost
my grip (laughs).

279
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,230
(Sings in foreign language)

280
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,067
(Foot dragging)

281
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,241
(Elevator button pressed)

282
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,707
(Elevator button pressed)

283
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:19,022
-[Super]Well, hello shem,
how do you do?

284
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,983
- Hey doc, I'm okay.

285
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,110
- Still with the
doctor business, huh?

286
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:28,156
Enough, my doctoring
days are over young man.

287
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,327
I've retired to a life of drainage
pipes and frozen boilers.

288
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,163
Look at my hands.
Covered in filth.

289
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,831
- Yeah, I've been
meaning to ask you about

290
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,541
that shovel and the digging?

291
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:41,669
- Well, let's just call
that my pet project.

292
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:46,049
The shovel and I are allies
in our struggle with the earth.

293
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:49,010
The Clay tends
relentlessly towards chaos.

294
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,762
So, we must be vigilant.

295
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:54,748
Always work to be done shem
and more work after that.

296
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,936
Hmm, I see you'Ve acquired
an ally of your own.

297
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,439
- Oh, this.
Yeah, honestly I don't

298
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,608
know if it's a friend or a foe.

299
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,759
The doctor thinks...

300
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:10,097
- It can't be as
awful as all that.

301
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,475
- He says it's psychological.

302
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,978
- I see, yes...

303
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:24,379
Would you be so kind as
to lend an old man a hand?

304
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,881
- [Shem] Yeah, sure, of course.

305
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,759
- Have I ever told
you shem of my

306
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,136
great affinity for letters?

307
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,596
- [Shem] I don't think so.

308
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,224
- They are truly
remarkable things.

309
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,227
The most basic of
all the elements.

310
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:43,189
The stuff of planets and
stars, oceans and rocks,

311
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,108
of darkness and light.

312
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:48,194
The subatomic
ingredients used by god,

313
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,947
in his cauldron of creation.

314
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,157
The letters hover,
suspended somewhere

315
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,618
between space and no space.

316
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:59,622
Anchoring all there is to
the source of all there is,

317
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:02,959
so we were never set
adrift into nothingness.

318
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,420
The mind comprehends
the letters.

319
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,672
The letters expand the mind.

320
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,007
The mind moves the body.

321
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:13,970
The body makes manifest tools
for the minds exploration.

322
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,304
- [Shem] That's interesting.

323
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:18,474
- But these letters are
only representations...

324
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,017
Signifiers of pure abstraction.

325
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:23,604
It's the meaning behind the
letters that give them purpose.

326
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:27,066
Just as you, the soul that
is you, is an abstraction

327
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,902
that finds expression
in your body.

328
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:34,824
This mind shem is inextricably
linked to this body.

329
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:38,327
To sever that connection,
well young shem,

330
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,353
that spells death.

331
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,817
Well I thank you
for your help shem.

332
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:50,572
Now then, I better
rest these old bones.

333
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:56,345
Oh, somewhere I buried a
book I think you'd enjoy.

334
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,723
Stop by tomorrow and
you can pick it up.

335
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,041
- Thanks doc, I will.

336
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,020
- Make peace with
your body shem,

337
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:08,065
and it will be as oil fueling
the flame of your soul.

338
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,359
(Thunder in the distance)

339
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,487
Sounds like rain.

340
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:16,181
Well that's good, it's
good for the Clay.

341
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:21,102
Rest well shem and do mind
yourself on the stairs.

342
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,745
(Thunder crackling)

343
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,795
(Footsteps on stairs)

344
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,343
(Door slams shut)

345
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,536
(Door swings open)

346
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,979
(Seductive music pours out)

347
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,452
- [Woman] Hi neighbor.

348
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,457
- Hi.

349
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,003
- [Woman] Shame
about the elevator.

350
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,257
- Yeah, it is.

351
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,844
Did, ah...
Did you just move in?

352
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,682
(Seductive music)

353
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,998
- [Woman] Would you
mind coming closer?

354
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:50,025
It's so hard to hear
you over the music.

355
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,466
- I asked if you'd
just moved in.

356
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,057
- [Woman] Your name
is shem, isn't it?

357
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,769
- Shem, yes.

358
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,980
How did you know that?

359
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:32,859
- (Laughs) I didn't silly,
that's why I asked.

360
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,403
- Right.

361
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,909
- Well, yes it is.

362
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,916
-Tell me something, shem.

363
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,337
Are you by any chance dead?

364
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:58,677
- I'm sorry, I
thought you said dead.

365
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,323
- That's right sweet stuff.

366
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,016
You're not dead, are you?

367
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:10,730
- Well, not yet apparently.

368
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,710
- [Woman] I put little
faith in appearances.

369
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:18,756
And besides, the police
seem to think you might be.

370
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,049
- [Shem] The police?

371
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,200
- [Woman] Detectives, yes.

372
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,120
- The police are looking for me?

373
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:28,248
What did they say?

374
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:30,959
- Just that you might be dead.

375
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,172
- Was that all?
- That's all I can recall.

376
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,388
- Well, um...

377
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,434
- I guess I'll be going then.

378
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,020
- I guess you will.

379
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,028
- Right.

380
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,161
Should I close the door?

381
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,792
- I'm expecting someone.

382
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,771
- Right, okay.

383
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:18,548
So, goodnight.

384
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:24,387

(Drawer sliding)

397
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,128
- [Bentzi] Okay, shem
there is one possibility.

398
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,148
It's a long shot, it's still
in the experimental stage.

399
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,758
(Thunder cracking)

400
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:31,764

real life mad scientist type.

(Storm raging outside)

402
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,751
- [Doc] The names, the letters.

403
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,795
They are the keys of
communication between

404
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:47,655
the intellectual
and the physical.

405
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,408
(Heavy rainfall)

406
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,346
To sever that connection,

407
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,916
well, young shem,
that spells death.

408
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,145
- [Benzti] He's been
obsessing over proprioception,

409
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,189
the whole mind body
connection and all that.

410
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,633
(Storm raging outside)

411
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,972

testing on human subjects.

413
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,209

- [Shem] Hello?

428
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,542
Doc?

429
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,879
Hello?

430
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:14,594
Doc, it's shem are you home?

(Footsteps)

434
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,150
- Who are you?
What are you doing here?

435
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,861
- Excuse me, I'm sorry.

436
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,946
I live here, in the building.

437
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:24,891
I'm doc's friend,
the super, sorry.

438
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,412
I came to pick up a
book and I knocked

439
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,314
but the door was open so I...

440
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,483
I'm shem.

441
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:42,408
- So you're the shem that my
uncle keeps going on about?

442
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:47,455
Sorry, I didn't
hear you come in.

443
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:51,959
Wow, how embarrassing.

444
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,586
Were you...

445
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,297
Have you been
standing there long?

446
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:04,013
- I should have
waiting outside, sorry.

447
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,205
- Well, where are my manners?

448
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,540
Can I get you
something to drink?

449
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:17,836
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

450
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,588
- I'm in desperate need
of a glass of water,

451
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:22,531
so it really wouldn't
be any bother.

452
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,576
- Okay, thanks.

453
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,430
- I thought you looked
thirsty, now wait here...

454
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:31,350
No, have a seat, make
yourself comfortable

455
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:34,228
and I'll be back in
a flash (laughs).

456
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,504

embarrassing.

460
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,570
Now that's not a man who
looks very comfortable.

461
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:28,389
Didn't I tell you to make
yourself comfortable?

462
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,952
- Sorry, I was just...

463
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,728
- Come, let's sit.

464
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,214

Do you mind if I
ask about your leg?

468
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,704
I'm sorry, that was rude.

469
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,600
- Oh, my leg, right.

470
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:40,211
No, I don't mind,
it's just kind of

471
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,982
it's hard to explain, really.
You probably...

472
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,401
- Right, it's none of
my business, I'm sorry.

473
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,528
- No, no don't apologize.

474
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,930
It's just that it's, it's

475
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:54,433
it's hard for me to...

476
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,229
I'm not used to talking with...

477
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,693
- Are you always this shy?

00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:07,988
- Shy?

479
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,325
No, I mean...

480
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:16,330
Only around other people.

481
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:21,752
- (Laughs) That's funny.

482
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,967
(Laughter)

483
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,229
Seriously though.

484
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,315
You seem like...

485
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,569
- What?

486
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,548
- Nothing, it's
none of my business.

487
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,341
I mean, I don't even know you.

488
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:54,136

- What?

489
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,847
No, of course not.

490
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,622
It's just...

491
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:03,311
You seem, well, depressed.

492
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:06,839
Kind of weighed down, like
you're guilty of something?

493
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,652
I don't know, like
you're sitting around

494
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,637
waiting for a piano
to fall on your head.

495
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:19,119

496
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,354
Really colorful.

497
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:26,293
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't
say things like that.

498
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,713
I just blurt stuff
out sometimes.

499
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:33,657
- No, no it's good
to hear it, you know

500
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,846
objectified like that, just...

501
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:41,373
Not a piano, you know?

502
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,060
Too comical.

503
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:48,714
- (Laughs) Oh, I see, so
you're a true tragedian?

504
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,801
- Oh, I don't know if
I'm truly anything.

505
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,138
- [Tiferet] See now,
what does that even mean?

506
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,768
- Nothing.

507
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,938
Sorry, just some...

Ticket.

516
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,002
- [Shem] Of course.

517
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,424
- Thank you sir.

518
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,696
What is this?
- A ticket.

519
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,241
- Yes it is, only
not for this train.

520
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,785
As you can see, we are
in the middle of the day.

This ticket is for
the midnight train.

- Is it?

523
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:31,585
I mean, I didn't know
there was a difference.

524
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,254
- And yet, there is.

525
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,089
- [Shem] Is there
anything that can be done?

526
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:39,241
- What would you suggest, sir?

527
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:44,705
- Listen, I'm late
for an appointment.

528
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,725
At least, I think I am.

529
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,293
Maybe that's later too.

- For me?
- [Train conductor] For you.

533
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:21,843
- [Shem] Hello.

534
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:24,119
- [Bentzi] Hey, rabbi.
What's up?

535
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,309
- Bentzi?

536
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,269
- [Bentzi] That's
right, old pal.

537
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:34,064
- How did you know I was here?

538
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,316
- [Bentzi] I have
your number, remember?

539
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,443
Anyway, Nicole and I
are heading out tonight.

540
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,654
You should come with US.

541
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,322
- Who's Nicole?

542
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,115
- [Bentzi] That hot little
number from my office.

543
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,599
You'Ve gotta remember her.

544
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,227
She's great, really
wants to hang out.

545
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,855
So come on, don't tell me you
got something better to do.

546
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,004
Shem, you still there dude?

547
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,048
- [Shem] Yeah bentzi, I'm here.

548
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:02,592
- [Bentzi] So, what d'ya say?

549
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:06,137
- [Shem] I don't know,
where would we go?

550
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:07,555
- [Bentzi] There's this
place I heard about just over

551
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:11,166
the bridge, some club or
something called the fringes.

552
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,502
I hear it's something else.

553
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,940
- [Shem] Do you mean
the mysterious show?

554
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,943
- [Bentzi] Looky, looky
even the rabbis heard of it.

555
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,261
So, come on it'll be a blast.

556
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:30,352
Hey, mochin, you there?

557
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,605
- Yeah, bentzi okay.

558
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,710
Let's see what all
the fuss is about.

559
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,402
(Match striking)

560
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,659
(Industrial undertone)

561
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,181
- [Tiferet] I want
you to dance with me.

562
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:52,642
- [Shem] What?
- [Tiferet] Dance with me.

563
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:55,061
- [Shem] Oh, no
no, I've never...

564
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,604
I don't think i'd
be any good at it.

565
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:59,065
- [Tiferet] Oh nonsense,
come right this instant.

566
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,300
- [Shem] But tiferet,

567
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,653
I'm not supposed to...

568
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:06,740
- [Tiferet] Come
on, it'll be fun.

569
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,200
You can learn a lot about a
person from how they dance.

570
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:11,477
Maybe you'll even
surprise yourself.

571
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,400
- [Woman] (Whispers) Shem.

572
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,531

00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,426
Shem?

582
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,762
Shem?

583
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:32,307
Come on shem, it's
time to go in.

584
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,228
Hey, are you okay?

585
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:39,690
What's wrong with
your friend Ben?

586
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,504

- Cool your heels.

592
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,696

And burnin', huh (laughs)?

(Laughter)

601
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,845

(Laughter)

603
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:26,213

614
00:50:57,637 --> 00:51:00,307
[Bum] - This one,

- [Doc] If you think
of your body as a prison,

625
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:37,779
then that's what it will be,

626
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:40,263

to levitate yourself

630
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:55,028
out of your body.

631
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:58,132
Try instead to elevate
your body with your head.

632
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:00,117
- Bum (laughing)

633
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:03,370

(Door opens and creaks)

660

- Say doc, you got
any food lying around?

You should get
some rest, and again

- Yeah, hi. How's
it going? Look,

712
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,078
sorry to bother you, I just...

713
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,271
- (Laughs) Are you now?

714
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,918
- Yeah, look I
live down the hall

715
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:33,128
and I just got mugged
in the stairwell.

716
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,046
I'm okay but...

717
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:37,198
- [Woman] Oh, you're not hurt?

718
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,327
- No, I mean nothing serious.

719
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,622
I banged my head but...

720
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:48,143
The point is, my keys
fell and this guy,

721
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:50,354
the one who hit me,
this total maniac or

722
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:52,314
his dog maybe, I don't know.

723
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:55,150
Either way, they took them.
My keys.

724
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:58,595
- (Chuckles) Oh my.

725
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:01,222
That's quite a tale.

726
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:03,909
- Yeah, I know.
Crazy, right?

727
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:06,686
But I swear it's all true.

728
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:10,499
So now I can't get into my
apartment, I'm locked out.

729
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:14,044
I saw your door was open, so
I thought you must be awake.

730
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:17,614
Maybe I could use your
phone to call the super.

731
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:28,708
- The phone?
The super?

732
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:34,148
I see but uh, tell me something.

733
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,215
Mr. Neighbor.

734
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:39,028
How do I know you're not
just trying to get into a

735
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:41,697
defenseless naked
woman's apartment

736
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:44,390
in the dead of night, hmm?

737
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:49,979
Who knows what dreadful things
you might try to do to me.

738
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:57,904
- Look, your door was
open, I just thought...

739
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:02,760
You know what,
forget it, thanks.

740
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:05,703
- Oh stop it.
(Chuckles)

741
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,223
You're just
precious, aren't you?

742
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:10,333
Such a child.

743
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:13,503
Get your silly self in here.

744
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:18,591
- Should I...

745
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:23,304
Do you wanna put something on?

746
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,936
- I'm perfectly comfortable.

747
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,165
- Right.

748
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,316
(Door creaks)

749
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:41,447
- Be a doll and close
the door, would you?

750
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:48,263
(Door slams shut)

751
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:50,957
(Music gets louder)

752
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:11,787
- Well sailor, take
off your coat,

753
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,747
have a seat.

754
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:15,523
Stay a while.

755
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:26,617
(Seductive music)

756
01:03:02,528 --> 01:03:04,173
- You mind if I smoke?

757
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:06,866
- Is that how you introduce
yourself to a lady?

758
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,872
- Sorry.

759
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:16,417
I'm aver, I live down the hall.

760
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:20,546
- [Woman] Aver.

761
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:24,550
Aver (laughs).

762
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,554
How do I know that name?

763
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,826
- It's biblical.
- [Woman] Is it?

764
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:36,312
- That's what they
tell me, and you are?

765
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:38,648
- [Woman] Who am I?

766
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:42,151
Who am I, indeed?

767
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:46,239
I am ancient, I am new.

768
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:49,700
I am hidden from plain view.

769
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:53,329
I am darkness before light.

770
01:03:53,746 --> 01:03:57,583
I whisper secrets in the night.

771
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:05,550
- So you're a poet.

772
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:08,427
- [Woman] (Laughs)

773
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:13,224
No.

774
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:16,561
But I've known my share.

775
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,916
- Any I may have read?

776
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,836
- Oh poo, you'll
bore me to tears

777
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:27,029
with all that
dreadful small talk.

778
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:30,592
- Sorry.

779
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:33,160
- Don't be sorry silly.

780
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,122
Weren't you about to smoke?

781
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:42,062
- But I still don't
know your name.

782
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:46,090
- Ooohhh. Okay,
Mr. Smarty pants.

783
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:49,427
You can call me Lila.

784
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:53,973
Now please, do enjoy
that cigarette.

785
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:07,820
(Matchsticks rattle)

786
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:13,242
(Hookah bubbling)

787
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,080
(Match striking)

788
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:26,505
- Would you like a hit?

789
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:32,303
- No thanks.
- Suit yourself.

790
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:37,200
Tell me, aver.

791
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:40,186
Do you know much
about the human brain?

792
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,525
- The brain?

793
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:51,173
No, not really.

794
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:55,177
- [Lila] Oh, but it's such a
fascinating piece of equipment.

795
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,535
- Okay.

796
01:05:58,162 --> 01:06:01,666
- [Lila] Did you
know, for example,

797
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:05,854
that there's a
place, a dark place,

798
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:08,523
buried deep inside
the limbic system that

799
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:12,527
the doctors deliciously refer
to as the pleasure center?

800
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:14,751
The doctors deliciously refer
to as the pleasure center?

801
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:26,899
- [Lila] Imagine, Mr. Man.

802
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,550
Inside that little
head of yours,

803
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:38,428
lies an electrochemical
wonderland.

804
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:42,915
Of all worldly delights
such as eating and

805
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:48,129
drinking and

806
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:53,759
fucking.

807
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:55,761
(Music stops)

808
01:06:56,721 --> 01:07:01,350
- Umm, that's interesting.

809
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:04,162
Maybe, I umm, should...

810
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:07,148
- How's about turning
over that record, big boy?

811
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:12,611
(Record needle bumping)

812
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,577
- Sure.

813
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:45,770
(Lever cicks)

814
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:08,084
So, I think I've
bothered you enough.

815
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:11,212
I really should be going.

816
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,648
If I could just
use your phone...

817
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:15,716
- Who's stopping you?

818
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:20,679
(Mystical music)

819
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:33,859
You know, it is rather late.

820
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:37,988
Do you think it's wise
to wake the super now?

821
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:45,013
- What time is it?

822
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:48,165
- [Lila] It's late
aver, it's very late.

823
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:54,130
If you want, you could
spend the night here.

824
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,550
With me.

825
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:03,865
- I don't know, I
wouldn't want to impose.

826
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:06,868
- Oh, it's no imposition.

827
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:09,246
On the contrary,
you'll be giving

828
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:12,231
me a chance to do my
good deed for the day.

829
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:16,753
- [Aver] Are you sure?

830
01:09:16,777 --> 01:09:18,672
It's an awful lot to ask.

831
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:21,133
- Oh, I'm quite certain cutie.

832
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:24,386
We should let that
poor old man sleep.

833
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:27,913
He must be tired after
his long days work.

834
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:37,256
After all aver, what
are neighbors for?

835
01:09:46,056 --> 01:09:49,435
(Mystical music)

836
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,220
- [Lila] (Heavy breathing)

837
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:32,978
(Moaning)

838
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:45,741
(Wheels squeaking)

839
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:54,833
(Moaning)

840
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:17,648
(Moaning echoing)

841
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:40,713
Shem.

842
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,305
Shem.

843
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:54,935
Sweet shem.

844
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:58,522
(Moaning in distance)

845
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:09,116
(Exhaling)

846
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:26,342
- [Detective m] You noga?

847
01:12:28,218 --> 01:12:30,596
- [Detective w]
We're the detectives.

848
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:36,352
We found something
that belongs to you.

849
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:42,959
- [Aver] Hey, that's my
wallet, where'd you find that?

850
01:12:42,983 --> 01:12:45,778
- [Detective m] We'll get
to that in just a minute.

851
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:51,343
- [Detective w] So Mr. Noga,
we hear you like the country.

852
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,094
- [Aver] The country?

853
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:56,806
- Yeah the country, you know
trees, birds, bees, cows.

854
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:58,624
All that shit.

855
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,602
- Not really.

856
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,812
- [Detective w] But you were
just there, weren't you?

857
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:05,631
About say, two nights ago.

858
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:07,758
(Coffin lid creaking)

859
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,612
Name's Herman Walker.

860
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,947
But then you're old
buddies, aren't ya?

861
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:15,641
He told US you guys go way back.

862
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:18,644
- [Detective m] Games up, noga.

863
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,790
He told US all about it.

864
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:23,291
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

865
01:13:23,315 --> 01:13:26,294
- Did you know your
chauffeur is a grave robber?

866
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:29,130
- [Detective m] You sure
know how to pick 'em noga.

867
01:13:29,154 --> 01:13:30,882
- I didn't pick him, okay?

868
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:32,884
I was lost in the
woods and this guy

869
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:34,844
shows up offering me a ride.

870
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:36,388
It's not like I
could just jump on

871
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,681
the next bus into
town, now could I?

872
01:13:38,705 --> 01:13:41,643
- Why don't you tell
US about your roommate?

873
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:44,336
- Cause I don't have one.
- [Detective m] No?

874
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:47,047
Explain this then.

875
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:54,513
- [Detective w] Pay close
attention to the address.

876
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:56,908
- [Aver] (Thinking)
Same as mine.

877
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:57,975
That's weird.

878
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:00,328
Must be a clerical
error or something.

879
01:14:00,352 --> 01:14:02,414
- [Detective w] Could be,
but then we can't explain

880
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,666
the fact that Mr.
mochin's wallet was found

881
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:07,127
in the same place
as we found yours.

882
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:08,586
- Yeah, where's that?

883
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:11,864
- In this poor
bastards coat pocket.

884
01:14:17,661 --> 01:14:20,014
- [Aver] Where's...
He's got no...

885
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:24,144
- [Detective m] Head.
Yeah we noticed that too.

886
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:27,045
Maybe you can tell
US where to find it.

887
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:31,151
- What?
You think I did this?

888
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:32,902
- Tell me something, noga.

889
01:14:32,926 --> 01:14:35,280
Why aren't you
wearing your yamaka?

890
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:36,573
- What?

891
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:38,658
- Bet he's not wearing
his tzitzit either.

892
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:40,642
- No tefillin this
morning neither.

893
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:44,247
You spill your seed
last night, noga?

894
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:45,457
- My seed?

895
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,542
- She really got
to you, didn't she?

896
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:51,695
Got inside you, it's just
a matter of time now.

897
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:55,008
You fucked her, am I right?

898
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:57,635
You did, didn't you?

899
01:14:57,659 --> 01:14:59,804
Goddamn, grave digger.

900
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:02,599
She's got you good now,
just tickling those nodes

901
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:05,667
all over that little
head of yours.

902
01:15:08,086 --> 01:15:12,567
Kids a goner, lost in the woods.

903
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:14,319
Let's blow.

904
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:15,987
- What about the girl?

905
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:19,991
- [Detective m] Out of our
jurisdiction, nothing we can do.

906
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:22,952
Your day of reckoning
is gonna come, noga.

907
01:15:22,976 --> 01:15:24,787
We're gonna find that head.

908
01:15:24,811 --> 01:15:27,415
And when we do, I
know the whole thing

909
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:29,667
is gonna be tied to you.

910
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:32,253
Why don't you hold onto
that picture for awhile.

911
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:34,905
May get ya thinkin' for once.

912
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,827
(Train breaks whining)

913
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:43,747
(Birds chattering)

914
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:47,876
(Low hum)

915
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:51,463
(Pipes groaning)

916
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:06,562
(Eerie rattling)

917
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:19,032
(Telephone rings)

918
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:21,952
(Telephone rings)

919
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:25,014
(Telephone rings)

920
01:16:25,038 --> 01:16:27,833
(Answering machine picks up)

921
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,812
- [Doc] Hello,
aver. Doc here.

922
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:34,315
Just want to make sure
everything is still on for tonight.

923
01:16:34,339 --> 01:16:35,775
My niece is...

924
01:16:35,799 --> 01:16:37,193
You didn't here this from me.

925
01:16:37,217 --> 01:16:39,946
But she is simply bubbling
over with excitement.

926
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:42,156
You'll take her somewhere
nice, of course.

927
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:46,452
And, it goes without saying,
be on your best behavior.

928
01:16:46,476 --> 01:16:49,730
Well, that's all,
just making sure.

929
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:53,167
Oh, I nearly forgot.

930
01:16:53,191 --> 01:16:55,336
There is one thing.

931
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:58,131
A pair of detectives
dropped by earlier.

932
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:00,991
They seemed quite eager
to find out if you...

933
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:06,055
Actually, it would be best
to discuss this in person.

934
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:08,516
I'll drop by a
little later, yes?

935
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:11,418
Well, until then, then.

936
01:17:15,672 --> 01:17:18,091
(Knocking on door)

937
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:29,102
(Chopin's nocturne op. 27 no.1)

938
01:17:49,539 --> 01:17:51,166
(Floor creaks)

939
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:57,089
- Aver, hi.

940
01:17:58,256 --> 01:18:00,133
You're late.

941
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:04,596
- Yeah, I know.

942
01:18:05,555 --> 01:18:07,432
Something came up.

943
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:10,995
Time, I just lost track of it.

944
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:15,107
- (Chuckles) You
and my uncle both.

945
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:17,776
You're both very late.

946
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:23,115
- Look I'm really, truly sorry.

947
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:25,992
I brought you these.

948
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:44,553
- Mmm, lilies.
I just love lilies.

949
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,347
Did you know that?

950
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:50,410
Of course not, how
could you know that?

951
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:53,287
Okay, I'll tell you what.

952
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:55,498
I'll just go put these
in some water and

953
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:58,150
think about maybe forgiving you.

954
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:11,246
- [Tiferet] So.

955
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:15,834
You didn't happen to
see him today, did you?

956
01:19:16,501 --> 01:19:18,003
- Who?

957
01:19:19,212 --> 01:19:21,214
- [Tiferet] My uncle.

958
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,386
- No, I didn't.

959
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,849
- [Tiferet] Well that's funny.

960
01:19:32,559 --> 01:19:34,019
- [Aver] Is it?

961
01:19:36,354 --> 01:19:37,999
- [Tiferet] Well, before
he left he said that

962
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:40,692
he wanted to talk to you.

963
01:19:41,401 --> 01:19:43,820
And I haven't seen him since.

964
01:19:45,655 --> 01:19:47,824
- Well, he never came by.

965
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:52,078
Maybe something else came up.

966
01:19:59,544 --> 01:20:01,880
- [Tiferet] What
are you looking at?

967
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:05,050
- Nothing.

968
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:11,723
- Nothing?

969
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:16,978
- Now you on the other
hand, are somethin' else.

970
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:21,542
- Okay, charmer.

971
01:20:21,566 --> 01:20:26,112
Speaking of things, there's
still something that you owe me.

972
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:29,741
- Really?
What's that?

973
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:33,888
- [Tiferet] Why, aver noga?

974
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:36,456
You still owe me a dance.

975
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:39,626
- What?

976
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:42,438
You mean here?
Now?

977
01:20:42,462 --> 01:20:45,191
Before I've even had a chance
to consume any alcohol?

978
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:48,844
- [Tiferet] (Giggles)
Absolutely, immediately.

979
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:55,016
(Jazzy music)

980
01:21:01,731 --> 01:21:03,084
- [Aver] I'm really
not any good.

981
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:06,862
- [Tiferet] Hush, silly.
Just do what feels natural.

982
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:16,246
You're getting it.

983
01:21:16,454 --> 01:21:18,623
Just follow the music.

984
01:21:24,754 --> 01:21:31,761
(Music continues)

985
01:21:43,148 --> 01:21:44,876
- [Aver] What?

986
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,253
Why are you looking
at me like that?

987
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:51,156
- It's just...
I don't know.

988
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:54,075
There's something
different about you.

989
01:21:56,369 --> 01:21:58,371
- [Aver] Is there?

990
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:01,917
- Yes.

991
01:22:03,668 --> 01:22:05,503
Something.

992
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:09,591
I can't put my finger on it.

993
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:12,010
What is it?

994
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:16,014
- Well. Tiferet.

995
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:19,851
I was hoping you
wouldn't notice.

996
01:22:22,145 --> 01:22:26,358
(Trumpet solo)

997
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:07,208
- May I show you to your table?

998
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:09,526
- [Aver] Sure, that
would be great.

999
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:20,221
- Would you like to start
with some wine, sir?

1000
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:21,889
- Yes, thank you.

1001
01:23:21,913 --> 01:23:23,915
Is white okay?

1002
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:26,710
- Yes, of course.

1003
01:23:27,627 --> 01:23:29,397
- An excellent choice, monsieur.

1004
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:31,423
Mademoiselle.

1005
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:43,560
- This is a nice place.
Have you been here before?

1006
01:23:45,562 --> 01:23:50,275
- I don't know.
- (Laughs) You don't remember?

1007
01:23:51,317 --> 01:23:54,005
- No, I think I was
here recently but

1008
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:57,490
it looks different now,
they must have remodeled.

1009
01:24:00,618 --> 01:24:02,930
- Do you know that woman?

1010
01:24:02,954 --> 01:24:04,265
- What woman?

1011
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:06,291
- That woman at the bar?

1012
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:13,357
- No, I don't think so.
Why do you ask?

1013
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:16,051
- Cause she keeps
looking over here.

1014
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:17,969
- [Aver] Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1015
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:24,851
- [Avert] Well,
I don't know her.

1016
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:29,564
(Faint moan)

1017
01:24:31,107 --> 01:24:33,335
- I apologize for
the intrusion sir,

1018
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:35,046
but I regret to
inform you that we

1019
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:37,298
have run out of white wine.

1020
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:40,468
Would you care to try
one of our reds instead?

1021
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:42,827
Compliments of the
house, of course.

1022
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:47,082
- Sure, thanks.
- [Waiter] Very good, sir.

1023
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:52,003
(Dog barking in distance)

1024
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:54,547
- Are you okay, aver?

1025
01:24:57,550 --> 01:25:02,097
- Yeah, I'm just surprised
they let a dog in here.

1026
01:25:02,222 --> 01:25:04,075
- What dog?

1027
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:06,535
- The dog.
You didn't hear that?

1028
01:25:06,559 --> 01:25:09,104
- No, I didn't aver.

1029
01:25:09,687 --> 01:25:10,831
(Dog barking in distance)
- [Aver] There.

1030
01:25:10,855 --> 01:25:12,500
You must have
heard it that time.

1031
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:16,319
- No, I don't hear any dog.
Are you sure?

1032
01:25:19,697 --> 01:25:22,408
Do you know her?
Do you know that woman?

1033
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:25,513
(Dog barking in distance)

1034
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:27,247
- I can't.

1035
01:25:28,998 --> 01:25:30,518
The dog.

1036
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:33,270
- Aver, are you okay?
Aver.

1037
01:25:33,294 --> 01:25:36,214
(Dog barks echoing)

1038
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:40,301
- Your wine, sir.

1039
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:44,222
(Wine trickling)

1040
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:58,236
(Distant barking echoes)

1041
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:12,208
(Laughter)

1042
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:15,729
- I see it.
Aver.

1043
01:26:15,753 --> 01:26:17,964
I see it.

1044
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:20,258
(Loud barking)

1045
01:26:20,758 --> 01:26:23,178
Aver, I see it.

1046
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:29,184
- Tiferet.
- Stop, make it stop.

1047
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:33,563
- Hey, stop it, hey.

1048
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:35,231
(Laughter)

1049
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:37,734
Hey, stop it!

1050
01:26:38,735 --> 01:26:40,570
(Dog barking loudly)

1051
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:42,405
(Moaning)

1052
01:26:44,407 --> 01:26:45,992
(Barking wildly)

1053
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:49,829
(Gasping for air)

1054
01:26:52,123 --> 01:26:55,293
(Dog barking in distance)

1055
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:23,029
- [Lila] (Moans)

1056
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:28,660
Hello lover.

1057
01:27:34,165 --> 01:27:37,502
(Laughs) Where ya
runnin' off to sweetie?

1058
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:42,900
- [Shem] Who are you?

1059
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:46,362
- Don't be silly lover,
come back to bed.

1060
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:47,905
- [Shem] What are
you doing here?

1061
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:51,659
What do you want?
- (Laughs) Such a silly child.

1062
01:27:51,683 --> 01:27:53,827
You know what I want.

1063
01:27:53,851 --> 01:27:55,829
