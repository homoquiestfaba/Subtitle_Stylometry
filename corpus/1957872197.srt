Blow out the candles.

185
00:08:58,206 --> 00:08:59,827
Okay.

186
00:09:05,172 --> 00:09:06,482
Whoo!

187
00:09:06,551 --> 00:09:07,965
Whoo!

188
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:11,862
I'll go get the presents.

189
00:09:11,931 --> 00:09:13,620
This looks fantastic, Kristin.

190
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:16,206
I'll say. Where's
everyone else's piece?

191
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:18,172
Here you go.

192
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:19,689
Whoa.

193
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:22,206
Okay, open them.

194
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:23,586
Okay.

195
00:09:23,655 --> 00:09:26,310
Do I see a gift here
from Kristin?

196
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:28,482
Mine is the one
with the green bow.

197
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:33,344
You know, I'm sure
it's a wonderful present,

198
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:36,310
but it's not the one
I'm looking for.

199
00:09:39,689 --> 00:09:42,586
Scoot your chair back a little
from the table.

200
00:09:44,724 --> 00:09:46,586
Okay.

201
00:09:46,655 --> 00:09:48,241
Like this?

202
00:09:50,344 --> 00:09:52,620
A little more, I think.

203
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:58,137
Okay.

204
00:09:58,206 --> 00:09:59,689
Great.

205
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:02,379
Are you okay, bill?

206
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:04,275
Oh, yeah, yeah.

207
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:08,310
Now, the gift
that I'm looking for from you

208
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:12,551
is...is really just one word,

209
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,413
just "yes."

210
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:23,517
I'm asking you to marry me,

211
00:10:23,586 --> 00:10:25,586
and by "me," I mean "we,"

212
00:10:25,655 --> 00:10:27,413
obviously.

213
00:10:30,344 --> 00:10:32,275
Oh, bill.

214
00:10:35,103 --> 00:10:37,448
It's beautiful.

215
00:10:37,517 --> 00:10:39,310
Did you two know about this?

216
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:41,103
I helped pick out the ring.

217
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:46,413
It's wonderful...

218
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:52,448
And you two...

219
00:10:52,517 --> 00:10:55,931
Oh, I love you so much.

220
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,448
I love you, bill.

221
00:10:57,517 --> 00:10:59,758
Am I going to get the gift
that I'm looking for?

222
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:03,413
I'm sorry, bill.

223
00:11:03,482 --> 00:11:08,482
No, I...I can't.

224
00:11:14,034 --> 00:11:16,827
Excuse me.

225
00:11:16,896 --> 00:11:19,000
Well, who wants cake, huh?

226
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:31,724
You don't want
to be our mom?

227
00:11:33,586 --> 00:11:35,172
Of course I do,
sweetheart.

228
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:37,344
I don't want anything
else in the world.

229
00:11:37,413 --> 00:11:39,172
Then tell me why,
Kristin,

230
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,655
because
I don't understand.

231
00:11:40,724 --> 00:11:42,206
It's me.

232
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:43,517
Don't you know

233
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:45,862
how much I've wanted
this moment?

234
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:49,137
How can I be your wife
and be here for the kids

235
00:11:49,206 --> 00:11:51,586
if I don't know who I am?

236
00:11:51,655 --> 00:11:52,724
Okay, so maybe

237
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:54,241
I'll try to call
the nanny agency again

238
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,379
and see
what happens.

239
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,689
I've called them again,

240
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,034
and they still have no record

241
00:11:58,103 --> 00:11:59,896
of me
ever being registered there,

242
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:02,517
and I don't know
who else to call.

243
00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:04,517
I have no information
to start with,

244
00:12:04,586 --> 00:12:08,103
no hometown, no anything.

245
00:12:08,172 --> 00:12:12,068
We know everything
we need to know about you now.

246
00:12:12,137 --> 00:12:15,689
You are a warm, wonderful,
loving woman

247
00:12:15,758 --> 00:12:16,758
who I love,

248
00:12:16,827 --> 00:12:18,206
who we love,

249
00:12:18,275 --> 00:12:20,275
and who we need,
Kristin,

250
00:12:20,344 --> 00:12:21,931
and want in our lives
forever,

251
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,862
and, you know,
you don't have a memory

252
00:12:23,931 --> 00:12:26,310
of who you were
when you came in our front door,

253
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,862
and I don't care,

254
00:12:27,931 --> 00:12:30,379
and whatever you were
before then,

255
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:32,241
it just doesn't make
a difference

256
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:35,448
to me or the kids.

257
00:12:35,517 --> 00:12:36,931
Yeah, we don't care
who you are.

258
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,172
He means

259
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:39,000
that we know you
and love you

260
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:39,965
already.

261
00:12:40,034 --> 00:12:44,862
But it makes a difference to me.

262
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:48,034
I mean, tonight,
you had a birthday,

263
00:12:48,103 --> 00:12:50,379
and, Kyle, you have one,

264
00:12:50,448 --> 00:12:52,379
August 24th,

265
00:12:52,448 --> 00:12:54,758
and Brittany,
march 11th.

266
00:12:54,827 --> 00:12:58,758
Can you tell me
when my birthday is?

267
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:02,344
I don't even know
how to drive a car.

268
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:04,551
I mean,
how is that possible?

269
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,655
Where did I live

270
00:13:05,724 --> 00:13:07,586
that I never learned
how to drive?

271
00:13:07,655 --> 00:13:09,241
Hey, I'll be learning
in a couple of years.

272
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,586
I'll drive you around.

273
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:12,275
Everything here is so wonderful,

274
00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:13,793
but, lately,

275
00:13:13,862 --> 00:13:15,310
finding out

276
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:18,068
has seemed
more and more important.

277
00:13:18,137 --> 00:13:20,000
I mean, face it.

278
00:13:20,068 --> 00:13:21,793
Have you ever met
anyone like me,

279
00:13:21,862 --> 00:13:24,448
someone who knows nothing
about her past?

280
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:26,034
Let's just
make a deal.

281
00:13:26,103 --> 00:13:26,793
A deal?

282
00:13:26,862 --> 00:13:27,655
A deal.

283
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,172
You give me
my "yes,"

284
00:13:30,241 --> 00:13:32,034
and I promise you

285
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:35,310
that before we get married,
we'll find out all about you.

286
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:38,448
What if we don't like
what we find?

287
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:39,896
I can't imagine that.

288
00:13:39,965 --> 00:13:41,413
You know,
I haven't told you this before,

289
00:13:41,482 --> 00:13:42,620
but, somehow, I feel

290
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:44,344
like there's
something different,

291
00:13:44,413 --> 00:13:47,517
but what if it turns out
that I have a really weird past?

292
00:13:47,586 --> 00:13:49,000
What if I did
something terrible,

293
00:13:49,068 --> 00:13:52,586
and that's why
I can't even remember who I am?

294
00:13:52,655 --> 00:13:56,551
Kristin,
I promise you, we won't.

295
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,310
There's no way that you could be
the person you are now

296
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:01,724
and then to have been
something completely different

297
00:14:01,793 --> 00:14:02,965
before,

298
00:14:03,034 --> 00:14:05,551
and no matter what,

299
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,896
nothing will ever change
the way I feel about you.

300
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:10,965
It's not going to happen.

301
00:14:14,448 --> 00:14:16,000
Is that my "yes"?

302
00:14:17,517 --> 00:14:18,862
Yes.

303
00:14:18,931 --> 00:14:20,206
Oh...

304
00:14:21,931 --> 00:14:24,551
We're going to get married,

305
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,379
and we're going to live
happily ever after.

306
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,655
Just like in the fairy tales?

307
00:14:28,724 --> 00:14:30,206
Oh, yeah,

308
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:31,862
just like in all the stories
of make-believe.

309
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:33,137
Oh.

310
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:39,896
If you want
driving lessons,

311
00:14:39,965 --> 00:14:41,379
I'll make them

312
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:43,448
one of your
Christmas presents.

313
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:51,551
Wow.

314
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,689
We'd better go finish dessert
before uncle Johnny does.

315
00:14:54,758 --> 00:14:56,241
I heard that.

316
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,862
Too late.

317
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:00,931
We have find out, Kyle.

318
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,793
We have to help her.

319
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,379
Wahoo, are you in there?

320
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:16,275
No. I'm not here.

321
00:15:16,344 --> 00:15:18,655
We have work to do.

322
00:15:18,724 --> 00:15:19,724
All the elves
that helped you out last time

323
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,379
got into too much trouble.

324
00:15:21,448 --> 00:15:22,931
No cookies for three months!

325
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,620
Do you know what I've suffered?

326
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:26,586
Do you know
what I've been through?

327
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:29,758
Making reindeer-poo pies?

328
00:15:29,827 --> 00:15:32,413
Close enough,

329
00:15:32,482 --> 00:15:34,758
and now
I'm going to get my revenge.

330
00:15:34,827 --> 00:15:36,724
Ooh, I don't think
revenge is allowed

331
00:15:36,793 --> 00:15:38,310
at the north pole.

332
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:40,620
I'll make it
worth your while.

333
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,379
Get a hammer and a chisel
and come with me.

334
00:15:43,931 --> 00:15:46,413
All those years
of trying to get rid of her,

335
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:48,379
and she did it on her own.

336
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,344
She left of her own free will,

337
00:15:50,413 --> 00:15:52,586
went to be with that family,
the morgans.

338
00:15:52,655 --> 00:15:54,551
Well, goodbye, Ms. Perfect.

339
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,896
You're now Ms. Mortal,

340
00:15:55,965 --> 00:15:59,275
and that is going to make it all
so much easier.

341
00:15:59,344 --> 00:16:00,827
Well, do you know what makes it
even better?

342
00:16:00,896 --> 00:16:01,896
Somebody is finally

343
00:16:01,965 --> 00:16:04,517
going to buy US
some snowblowers?

344
00:16:04,586 --> 00:16:06,655
She doesn't even remember
that she ever lived here,

345
00:16:06,724 --> 00:16:09,068
or that Santa's her father,
I'm her sister,

346
00:16:09,137 --> 00:16:11,517
or that she has any powers.

347
00:16:11,586 --> 00:16:14,551
She's not going to save
the pole.

348
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,931
No, not this year.

349
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,379
Santa wants me to help him.

350
00:16:19,448 --> 00:16:20,827
I'm going to help him,
all right.

351
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,517
The old man is losing it,

352
00:16:22,586 --> 00:16:24,793
and I'm going to
help him lose it for good.

353
00:16:24,862 --> 00:16:26,206
Yes.

354
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:27,758
This will do.

355
00:16:27,827 --> 00:16:29,793
This is where we'll start.

356
00:16:34,931 --> 00:16:37,517
Here it is.

357
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,344
Good as new...Almost.

358
00:16:54,724 --> 00:16:55,620
It's even better than new.

359
00:16:55,689 --> 00:16:56,689
Yeah.

360
00:16:58,724 --> 00:17:00,206
Kristin...

361
00:17:00,275 --> 00:17:01,000
Yeah?

362
00:17:01,068 --> 00:17:02,793
Would you put it on?

363
00:17:02,862 --> 00:17:06,034
Oh, I'd be honored.

364
00:17:25,137 --> 00:17:26,724
It's our tree now.

365
00:17:26,793 --> 00:17:28,275
Yeah.

366
00:17:28,344 --> 00:17:31,310
We all have so much
to be thankful for,

367
00:17:31,379 --> 00:17:35,517
and Christmas gives US
a moment to remember that,

368
00:17:35,586 --> 00:17:38,551
and to remember
how beautiful it is

369
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,689
that we have each other.

370
00:17:40,758 --> 00:17:43,310
Last Christmas was so great,
Kristin,

371
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:45,655
because
we got you as our present.

372
00:17:45,724 --> 00:17:47,724
Which is not bad,
as far as presents go.

373
00:17:47,793 --> 00:17:49,793
It's a shame Kristin's
stuff got destroyed.

374
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:52,827
There was probably some I.D.
That would help US find out

375
00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:54,206
where to start looking
for her past.

376
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:55,793
You know, Johnny...

377
00:17:55,862 --> 00:17:57,413
What, what, what?
I know, my big mouth...

378
00:17:57,482 --> 00:17:59,413
No, actually,

379
00:17:59,482 --> 00:18:01,655
this time, I think
your big mouth is right.

380
00:18:01,724 --> 00:18:03,275
We all have to do
whatever we can

381
00:18:03,344 --> 00:18:06,172
to help Kristin figure out
where she comes from.

382
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:07,620
That includes you, right?

383
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:09,137
Yeah.

384
00:18:09,206 --> 00:18:11,689
I happen to have
some spare time now.

385
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,137
I could launch
an all-out attack

386
00:18:13,206 --> 00:18:14,137
on the cause.

387
00:18:14,206 --> 00:18:15,137
Then go for it.

388
00:18:15,206 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm all over it.

389
00:18:17,068 --> 00:18:19,689
This is
the most important thing now.

390
00:18:31,517 --> 00:18:34,482
Remember this?

391
00:18:34,551 --> 00:18:36,344
Kristin's.

392
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:38,034
Yes.

393
00:18:38,103 --> 00:18:40,275
She was so young when
you gave that to her.

394
00:18:40,344 --> 00:18:41,862
It seems so long ago.

395
00:18:41,931 --> 00:18:43,862
It was
a long time ago.

396
00:18:43,931 --> 00:18:45,758
What do you think she's doing
right now?

397
00:18:45,827 --> 00:18:47,310
Probably the same thing
we're doing,

398
00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:48,793
decorating the tree.

399
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:52,724
Here's rudolfa's doll.

400
00:18:52,793 --> 00:18:56,620
I'm still not quite sure
why she did that to it.

401
00:18:56,689 --> 00:18:58,241
You know,

402
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:02,034
it's amazing how two children
can be so completely different.

403
00:19:02,103 --> 00:19:12,517
Yes, isn't it?

404
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:14,620
Can't we let Christmas be
this year?

405
00:19:14,689 --> 00:19:15,551
Let it be?

406
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,655
Why should I let it be?

407
00:19:16,724 --> 00:19:18,413
Go.

408
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:20,931
I was never any good
at Christmas, anyway,

409
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,206
and look,
it's everywhere.

410
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:23,344
I'm drowning
in it.

411
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,379
Go.

412
00:19:25,448 --> 00:19:28,034
What else is there to do
at the north pole

413
00:19:28,103 --> 00:19:30,241
if you're no good
at Christmas?

414
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:33,379
Can't you go
any faster?

415
00:19:33,448 --> 00:19:34,620
Not by myself.

416
00:19:34,689 --> 00:19:36,172
I'd be happy
to help,

417
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,206
but my hands
have been worked to the bone

418
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:40,586
by Santa
and all the chores.

419
00:19:40,655 --> 00:19:41,310
Look at that nail.

420
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:42,689
Go.

421
00:19:44,206 --> 00:19:45,758
Smaller pieces,
wahoo.

422
00:19:45,827 --> 00:19:47,862
They have to fit
into the mail.

423
00:19:47,931 --> 00:19:49,413
Go.

424
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:52,689
Keep going.

425
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,206
You're getting there.

426
00:19:54,275 --> 00:19:55,689
Where is "there"?

427
00:19:55,758 --> 00:19:58,241
Did she live there?

428
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,310
Did she live--

429
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:02,931
yeah. Did she ever live there?

430
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,931
Yeah, I can send you
a picture.

431
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,310
Yeah, I'm looking for a Kristin.

432
00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:09,551
K-r-i-s...

433
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,931
No, no, no, not Kathy, not Kyla,
not Karla.

434
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,241
No, Kristin claus.

435
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,827
Well...

436
00:20:16,896 --> 00:20:20,758
No, I'm not trying
to sell anything.

437
00:20:47,103 --> 00:20:48,586
Are you sure?

438
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:50,206
This is really important.

439
00:20:50,275 --> 00:20:53,206
She's going to be our mom.

440
00:20:53,275 --> 00:20:55,172
Okay. Thanks.

441
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,931
Well,
I'd better check my list...

442
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,517
Twice.

443
00:21:35,482 --> 00:21:37,413
Oh, I could have sworn

444
00:21:37,482 --> 00:21:41,000
there was a professional
video camera here.

445
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:44,758
Perhaps over here...

446
00:21:47,517 --> 00:21:49,172
But I'm sure
there was a camera here

447
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,827
somewhere.

448
00:21:53,517 --> 00:21:55,206
Well, he said he would be here.

449
00:21:55,275 --> 00:21:58,000
Before or after
my hernia?

450
00:21:59,931 --> 00:22:01,172
Wahoo,
turn that thing on

451
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:03,275
and see if it works.

452
00:22:08,379 --> 00:22:10,275
Oh, Mr. Glitch,

453
00:22:10,344 --> 00:22:12,413
I'm delighted you came.

454
00:22:12,482 --> 00:22:15,034
You got me here. What?

455
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:18,862
Well, you're the absolute best
at electronics,

456
00:22:18,931 --> 00:22:21,413
and we need your expertise.

457
00:22:21,482 --> 00:22:24,689
Normally, I fix them
so they don't work.

458
00:22:24,758 --> 00:22:27,517
Yes,
and you do that so wonderfully,

459
00:22:27,586 --> 00:22:28,793
but doesn't that mean

460
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:30,448
that you know
how to make things work

461
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:32,413
as well?

462
00:22:32,482 --> 00:22:35,689
If there was something in it
for you...

463
00:22:35,758 --> 00:22:38,275
Like what?

464
00:22:38,344 --> 00:22:40,172
Oh, I know--

465
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:42,275
a no-money-back guarantee.

466
00:22:42,344 --> 00:22:44,275
Ooh, ooh,

467
00:22:44,344 --> 00:22:48,655
or a nice
nasty little static shock.

468
00:22:48,724 --> 00:22:52,206
Yes, well,
something like that...

469
00:22:54,344 --> 00:22:56,310
Yes, yes, yes.

470
00:22:56,379 --> 00:22:57,965
Ouch.

471
00:22:59,448 --> 00:23:02,000
Are we ready?

472
00:23:02,068 --> 00:23:03,655
Yes, yes.

473
00:23:03,724 --> 00:23:05,241
Cue Rudolf.

474
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,275
Rudolf!

475
00:23:10,137 --> 00:23:14,379
Oh, go see what happened
to that stupid reindeer.

476
00:23:19,586 --> 00:23:22,068
Yes!
I love when things go wrong.

477
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:30,517
Rudolf won't come out
of the barn.

478
00:23:30,586 --> 00:23:32,068
Never work with animals...

479
00:23:32,137 --> 00:23:33,551
[ Banging ]

480
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,034
Ow, ow, ow!

481
00:23:35,103 --> 00:23:36,344
No, stop, Rudolph.
Please, stop.

482
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:37,517
Ow, ow, ow.

483
00:23:37,586 --> 00:23:38,896
Or elves.

484
00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:40,551
Wahoo, get back in here

485
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,000
so we can get this
thing finished.

486
00:23:46,724 --> 00:23:49,068
He won't come out.

487
00:23:51,586 --> 00:23:53,931
All right, everybody.
Can we do this?

488
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,689
Okay, okay.

489
00:23:55,758 --> 00:23:57,344
Roll it.

490
00:23:57,413 --> 00:23:58,172
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

491
00:23:58,241 --> 00:24:00,655
What about the snow?

492
00:24:06,034 --> 00:24:07,862
Great.

493
00:24:13,482 --> 00:24:16,448

That would be so perfect

535
00:26:40,482 --> 00:26:41,931
What would?

536
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,931
I just saw
the weirdest commercial.

537
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,103
Yeah? What?

538
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:46,586
They're selling off
real pieces

539
00:26:46,655 --> 00:26:48,103
of the north pole.

540
00:26:48,172 --> 00:26:49,931
You send in
what you want,

541
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,103
and they send you
a chunk of brick,

542
00:26:52,172 --> 00:26:53,655
it looked like.

543
00:26:53,724 --> 00:26:55,620
It's a perfect gift for Kristin,

544
00:26:55,689 --> 00:26:57,448
and she hasn't really
been into it this year,

545
00:26:57,517 --> 00:26:59,103
like something's wrong
with Christmas.

546
00:26:59,172 --> 00:27:00,965
I know.

547
00:27:01,034 --> 00:27:03,344
She was so into Christmas
last year...

548
00:27:04,931 --> 00:27:08,310
So these are authentic pieces
of the north pole?

549
00:27:08,379 --> 00:27:09,517
Maybe dad will want one.

550
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,275
Probably.

551
00:27:11,344 --> 00:27:12,965
Hey, maybe
we should get a bunch.

552
00:27:22,793 --> 00:27:25,724
So I guess I'm wondering

553
00:27:25,793 --> 00:27:28,758
that even though we haven't
turned up anything yet,

554
00:27:28,827 --> 00:27:30,586
maybe can go ahead,

555
00:27:30,655 --> 00:27:32,724
make some plans
for the wedding.

556
00:27:32,793 --> 00:27:36,137
Mm. Yeah.

557
00:27:36,206 --> 00:27:38,275
That would be good.

558
00:27:38,344 --> 00:27:40,137
Um...

559
00:27:40,206 --> 00:27:41,896
What?

560
00:27:41,965 --> 00:27:43,655
I can't ever remember
being at one.

561
00:27:43,724 --> 00:27:45,172
I might need help.

562
00:27:45,241 --> 00:27:46,655
That's okay.

563
00:27:46,724 --> 00:27:47,965
We can hire
a wedding planner--

564
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:49,827
call around, find out
who some people have used.

565
00:27:49,896 --> 00:27:51,931
It will take the pressure off.

566
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,517
Okay.

567
00:27:53,586 --> 00:27:56,482
You know, there is one thing
we have to be able to tell him.

568
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:58,000
Mm?

569
00:27:58,068 --> 00:27:59,482
The date.

570
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:01,000
For the wedding?

571
00:28:01,068 --> 00:28:01,793
We're going to
have to be able

572
00:28:01,862 --> 00:28:03,482
to tell him that.

573
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:06,172
It could be any time.

574
00:28:06,241 --> 00:28:09,172
I'd like to do it
as soon as possible.

575
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:13,482
As long as we find out
what we need to find out,

576
00:28:13,551 --> 00:28:15,413
me too.

577
00:28:15,482 --> 00:28:17,896
Okay, so pick.

578
00:28:17,965 --> 00:28:20,551
My favorite day
is Christmas.

579
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,551
That's soon.

580
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,655
Okay.

581
00:28:25,724 --> 00:28:28,896
Lady,
you've got a date.

582
00:28:43,827 --> 00:28:45,655
Good morning, guys.

583
00:28:56,965 --> 00:28:59,517
Oh, yes,

584
00:28:59,586 --> 00:29:01,793
we'll be able to get rid
of a lot of the north pole

585
00:29:01,862 --> 00:29:03,862
this way.

586
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:07,551
You know, maybe there's a way
to do even better...

587
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,931
Or worse.

588
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,758
How?

589
00:29:10,827 --> 00:29:14,241
Well,
why stop with the buildings?

590
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:17,896
Why not sell
everything about the north pole?

591
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:19,517
Santa's own artifacts,

592
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:21,482
Santa's own possessions,

593
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,275
his clothes...

594
00:29:24,344 --> 00:29:25,758
Get rid of it all.

595
00:29:25,827 --> 00:29:27,379
There'll be nothing left.

596
00:29:27,448 --> 00:29:29,758
There'll be no chance
for a Christmas then.

597
00:29:29,827 --> 00:29:31,413
Santa's going
to notice.

598
00:29:31,482 --> 00:29:34,413
Well, he might.

599
00:29:36,655 --> 00:29:38,310
I have to come up with something

600
00:29:38,379 --> 00:29:39,827
to make him believe

601
00:29:39,896 --> 00:29:42,827
that it's all disappearing
for a reason.

602
00:29:48,034 --> 00:29:49,448
I have it.

603
00:29:49,517 --> 00:29:50,896
But I'm going to need

604
00:29:50,965 --> 00:29:54,172
at least five million
Teddy bears.

605
00:29:54,241 --> 00:29:56,310
Yes, five,

606
00:29:56,379 --> 00:30:00,551
and could you put them
in a bottomless bag, please?

607
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:04,275
Because they take up less space.

608
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,793
No, that's not all.

609
00:30:06,862 --> 00:30:11,344
What do you have
in the penguin line?

610
00:30:11,413 --> 00:30:13,413
Because I think
they're going to be popular

611
00:30:13,482 --> 00:30:15,206
this year.

612
00:30:15,275 --> 00:30:19,172
Why? Because I'm Santa.
That's why I know.

613
00:30:19,241 --> 00:30:22,310
Why do we have to
go through this every year?

614
00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:24,275
Don't you believe in me?

615
00:30:40,034 --> 00:30:42,379
[ Honking ]

616
00:30:42,448 --> 00:30:43,724
He must be in a hurry.

617
00:30:43,793 --> 00:30:46,241
The light
has been green.

618
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,379
For quite
some time now.

619
00:30:48,448 --> 00:30:49,827
You don't have to
put it in park

620
00:30:49,896 --> 00:30:52,517
every time you stop.

621
00:30:52,586 --> 00:30:55,344
A little Patience, please.

622
00:30:55,413 --> 00:30:57,068
I'm just learning.

623
00:30:57,137 --> 00:30:58,758
Well, learn
how to use the gas pedal!

624
00:30:58,827 --> 00:31:01,034
Hurry up!
Christmas is coming!

625
00:31:01,103 --> 00:31:04,896
All the more reason
for some understanding.

626
00:31:10,965 --> 00:31:12,724
Shall we
try to park?

627
00:31:12,793 --> 00:31:14,793
Ooh, well, that should be fun!

628
00:31:14,862 --> 00:31:19,758
Just put in in reverse
and we'll back into the space.

629
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,482
Just back in.

630
00:31:22,551 --> 00:31:25,068
Good!
You're doing good.

631
00:31:25,137 --> 00:31:28,413
Hey...

632
00:31:28,482 --> 00:31:30,068
Not so fast!
Not so fast!

633
00:31:35,724 --> 00:31:37,965
That wasn't right, was it?

634
00:31:40,206 --> 00:31:41,206
Have you ever

635
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:43,862
driven anything
before?

636
00:31:43,931 --> 00:31:45,862
A reindeer sleigh.

637
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:48,689
Okay...okay.

638
00:32:13,103 --> 00:32:14,620
I lost my pen.

639
00:32:14,689 --> 00:32:15,931
Oh, I'll get you one.

640
00:32:30,827 --> 00:32:32,517
Thank you.

641
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,000
Parallel parking, fail.

642
00:32:47,931 --> 00:32:49,896
Beautiful!

643
00:32:49,965 --> 00:32:52,448
These will go so quickly.

644
00:32:52,517 --> 00:32:54,000
You've done well.

645
00:32:54,068 --> 00:32:54,862
And remember,

646
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,965
every elf that helps

647
00:32:57,034 --> 00:32:58,482
gets a vacation

648
00:32:58,551 --> 00:32:59,724
anywhere
on the equator,

649
00:32:59,793 --> 00:33:01,482
where it's warm.

650
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:02,896
Santa never did
that for you,

651
00:33:02,965 --> 00:33:04,206
did he?

652
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:07,068
My, my, my.

653
00:33:07,137 --> 00:33:09,172
Well, lookee here.

654
00:33:09,241 --> 00:33:12,172
It's Kristin's doll
from when she was a little girl.

655
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:13,931
It's a shame
she isn't here

656
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,517
to see me dismantle
the pole.

657
00:33:17,586 --> 00:33:19,034
It would make it all
so much more delicious

658
00:33:19,103 --> 00:33:20,482
to see the look of horror
in her eyes

659
00:33:20,551 --> 00:33:22,896
when it's all gone...

660
00:33:22,965 --> 00:33:25,000
Just like she is--gone.

661
00:33:26,793 --> 00:33:28,586
Bye-bye.

662
00:33:39,965 --> 00:33:40,758
Before I begin,

663
00:33:40,827 --> 00:33:41,862
I'd like
to thank bill

664
00:33:41,931 --> 00:33:43,551
for giving me
the opportunity

665
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,000
to really run
with this thing.

666
00:33:45,068 --> 00:33:46,413
That's fine, Johnny.

667
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:49,000
What we really want to know now
is what you found out.

668
00:33:51,793 --> 00:33:53,413
I went the usual avenues--

669
00:33:53,482 --> 00:33:55,103
social security applications,

670
00:33:55,172 --> 00:33:56,655
hospitals in the area

671
00:33:56,724 --> 00:33:58,517
who might have had a record
of an accident victim

672
00:33:58,586 --> 00:33:59,551
who had lost her memory.

673
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,000
Claus as a surname here,

674
00:34:02,068 --> 00:34:03,275
in the state,

675
00:34:03,344 --> 00:34:07,724
and, in fact,
across the country.

676
00:34:07,793 --> 00:34:10,448
And, of course,
we know it's claus with a "c"

677
00:34:10,517 --> 00:34:13,517
instead of a "k,"
or a final "e."

678
00:34:13,586 --> 00:34:15,551
There's the final "e".

679
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,448
I checked with missing persons

680
00:34:17,517 --> 00:34:19,482
at the local
and federal level.

681
00:34:19,551 --> 00:34:22,275
There was a claus in Portland
that fit the profile,

682
00:34:22,344 --> 00:34:24,896
and a claus in Ohio
that looked pretty good,

683
00:34:24,965 --> 00:34:26,620
but those didn't pan out

684
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:29,068
as ever having
a Kristin claus in the clan.

685
00:34:29,137 --> 00:34:30,103
They didn't?

686
00:34:30,172 --> 00:34:31,827
No.

687
00:34:31,896 --> 00:34:33,724
So you didn't stop there,
did you, uncle Johnny?

688
00:34:33,793 --> 00:34:35,724
Of course not.

689
00:34:35,793 --> 00:34:38,586
It turns out there is
a whole group of claus's

690
00:34:38,655 --> 00:34:40,379
in a small town in Alaska.

691
00:34:40,448 --> 00:34:42,206
Claus after claus
after claus.

692
00:34:42,275 --> 00:34:43,827
So that's where
you found me?

693
00:34:46,724 --> 00:34:48,103
Well...

694
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:51,482
Johnny, please, please
what did you find out?

695
00:34:53,413 --> 00:34:55,931
Nothing.

696
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,482
I didn't find one lead
for a Kristin claus.

697
00:34:58,551 --> 00:34:59,655
No school records,

698
00:34:59,724 --> 00:35:01,344
no social security,

699
00:35:01,413 --> 00:35:02,758
no medical records.

700
00:35:02,827 --> 00:35:05,758
It's like the Bermuda triangle
fell into a black hole.

701
00:35:05,827 --> 00:35:08,206
I mean,
if she wasn't sitting here,

702
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:10,793
I'd tell you
Kristin claus doesn't exist.

703
00:35:10,862 --> 00:35:12,793
In fact, I'll tell you
what I'm going to do,

704
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:14,275
and I know it sounds crazy,

705
00:35:14,344 --> 00:35:15,896
but I'm going
to investigate this

706
00:35:15,965 --> 00:35:19,379
because I think
Kristin is a clone.

707
00:35:19,448 --> 00:35:21,758
It would really explain so much.

708
00:35:21,827 --> 00:35:23,241
No parents.

709
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:25,448
No records.

710
00:35:25,517 --> 00:35:28,000
I think she may be
a government experiment....

711
00:35:28,068 --> 00:35:30,103
Or maybe an alien.

712
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:31,620
It's enough.
That's enough.

713
00:35:31,689 --> 00:35:34,241
Oh...oh, oh.

714
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,172
I don't know why
everyone can't see it.

715
00:35:36,241 --> 00:35:39,206
It's so plain.

716
00:35:39,275 --> 00:35:40,448
What's that, Brittany?

717
00:35:40,517 --> 00:35:42,551
I know who you are.

718
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,482
Ah! You do?

719
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:45,275
Sure.

720
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:46,586
It's obvious.

721
00:35:46,655 --> 00:35:49,137
Kristin is Santa's daughter.

722
00:35:49,206 --> 00:35:50,241
Kristin claus.

723
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,931
Santa claus's daughter.

724
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,689
That's why we can't find
any reference of her here.

725
00:35:53,758 --> 00:35:55,275
That's why her favorite colors
are red and green.

726
00:35:55,344 --> 00:35:56,862
She wasn't even born here.

727
00:35:56,931 --> 00:35:58,172
She was born at the north pole.

728
00:35:58,241 --> 00:36:00,034
She lived there
until she came to live with US.

729
00:36:00,103 --> 00:36:03,172
Sweetheart, that's...

730
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:04,551
That's going to be
pretty hard to prove.

731
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,241
It's just like

732
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:08,000
uncle Johnny's
clone theory.

733
00:36:08,068 --> 00:36:11,275
Yeah, well,
at least cloning is real.

734
00:36:11,344 --> 00:36:12,586
Who's ever seen Santa claus,

735
00:36:12,655 --> 00:36:14,793
let alone
his daughter?

736
00:36:18,068 --> 00:36:19,793
Oops. Sorry.

737
00:36:23,344 --> 00:36:25,275
Brittany?

738
00:36:37,034 --> 00:36:39,172
It is simple, isn't it?

739
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:42,379
Christmas is almost
the only thing I know.

740
00:36:42,448 --> 00:36:45,413
And why wouldn't I be
Santa's daughter?

741
00:36:45,482 --> 00:36:46,655
So you believe me?

742
00:36:46,724 --> 00:36:51,000
Everything you said made sense.

743
00:36:51,068 --> 00:36:52,241
I knew you would.

744
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:55,724
Some things you can't prove.

745
00:36:55,793 --> 00:36:58,103
You've just got to believe.

746
00:36:58,172 --> 00:37:01,241
If you have proof,
you don't need faith.

747
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,448
That's what you mean, right?

748
00:37:03,517 --> 00:37:08,689
Brittany,
I need to be honest with you.

749
00:37:08,758 --> 00:37:12,241
I want to believe you,

750
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:14,896
but I guess the truth is

751
00:37:14,965 --> 00:37:19,827
that when it comes to something
as important to me as this is,

752
00:37:19,896 --> 00:37:24,586
even for me to believe,
I need some proof.

753
00:37:24,655 --> 00:37:27,793
So you don't believe me either?

754
00:37:27,862 --> 00:37:31,517
The important thing is
is for you to keep believing,

755
00:37:31,586 --> 00:37:34,586
no matter who else
believes or not.

756
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:37,172
It's the people who believe

757
00:37:37,241 --> 00:37:39,620
who are always
rewarded with the truth.

758
00:37:39,689 --> 00:37:42,241
So you go on believing,
Brittany.

759
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:46,793
There isn't anything
more important in the world.

760
00:37:48,793 --> 00:37:50,758
Kristin?
Yeah?

761
00:37:50,827 --> 00:37:52,655
You aren't going to leave US,
are you?

762
00:37:52,724 --> 00:37:55,310
Leave?

763
00:37:55,379 --> 00:37:57,862
What gave you that idea?

764
00:37:57,931 --> 00:37:59,413
Because I don't know
what would happen

765
00:37:59,482 --> 00:38:02,931
if we didn't find out
who you are.

766
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,344
You might leave...

767
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,931
And I don't want to lose
my mom again.

768
00:38:20,655 --> 00:38:22,931
Oh, no. That's not right.

769
00:38:25,448 --> 00:38:27,172
What happened to my glasses?

770
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:29,931
Oh, well.

771
00:38:36,724 --> 00:38:38,827
Don't tell me.

772
00:38:38,896 --> 00:38:40,931
Where did I put the key?

773
00:38:43,172 --> 00:38:45,413
I'm losing everything
these days.

774
00:38:46,965 --> 00:38:48,103
Hello, dad.

775
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:50,241
Oh, rudolfa.

776
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,379
Did you get the
letters organized?

777
00:38:51,448 --> 00:38:52,862
Oh, yes, dad. I'm on it.

778
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,068
Working all the time.

779
00:38:54,137 --> 00:38:55,551
Constantly.

780
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,344
Relentlessly.

781
00:38:58,413 --> 00:38:59,862
Were you going into
the present room?

782
00:38:59,931 --> 00:39:01,310
I would,

783
00:39:01,379 --> 00:39:03,482
but I seem to have misplaced
the key.

784
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:06,965
Oh, that isn't like you, dad.

785
00:39:07,034 --> 00:39:08,896
Yes. I know.

786
00:39:08,965 --> 00:39:10,103
I seem to
have misplaced

787
00:39:10,172 --> 00:39:11,206
a number
of things lately--

788
00:39:11,275 --> 00:39:12,034
all kinds
of things.

789
00:39:12,103 --> 00:39:14,034
Mm.

790
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:15,344
What does that mean?

791
00:39:15,413 --> 00:39:16,379
Oh, I don't know.

792
00:39:16,448 --> 00:39:17,413
Listen, pop,

793
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:18,689
far be it
for me to say.

794
00:39:18,758 --> 00:39:20,827
Spit it out, rudolfa.

795
00:39:20,896 --> 00:39:22,448
Well, you know,

796
00:39:22,517 --> 00:39:24,827
I remember that I was talking
with father time once

797
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:27,689
at the summer solstice
barbecue...

798
00:39:27,758 --> 00:39:29,551
Now, what was it he said?

799
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,689
Yes, what did he say?

800
00:39:31,758 --> 00:39:33,275
Oh, yes!

801
00:39:33,344 --> 00:39:34,068
That if Santa
starts to lose things

802
00:39:35,931 --> 00:39:39,862
and the north pole as we know it
kind of begins to disappear...

803
00:39:39,931 --> 00:39:41,827
Yes?

804
00:39:41,896 --> 00:39:46,068
Well, it means
that Santa is being replaced.

805
00:39:46,137 --> 00:39:49,517
Replaced?

806
00:39:49,586 --> 00:39:51,206
Well, I'm Santa claus.

807
00:39:51,275 --> 00:39:53,862
I've been
Santa claus forever.

808
00:39:53,931 --> 00:39:56,620
Yes, well...

809
00:39:56,689 --> 00:39:58,206
Nothing goes on forever.

810
00:39:58,275 --> 00:40:01,586
Well, it has been a long time.

811
00:40:01,655 --> 00:40:03,275
Oh, it couldn't
be, dad.

812
00:40:03,344 --> 00:40:06,551
I mean,
they wouldn't replace you.

813
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,827
Why would they?

814
00:40:08,896 --> 00:40:11,620
I've done
nothing wrong.

815
00:40:11,689 --> 00:40:14,241
Well, you've done
a great job.

816
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:16,620
Of course you have.

817
00:40:16,689 --> 00:40:18,448
Of course, it is

818
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:19,931
down to the wire
every year,

819
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,172
rushed,
hanging by a thread,

820
00:40:24,241 --> 00:40:26,931
no, it couldn't be.

821
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,379
It's just
our imagination.

822
00:40:29,448 --> 00:40:31,344
Well, sorry
to interrupt.

823
00:40:31,413 --> 00:40:33,000
I'll see you later.

824
00:40:40,103 --> 00:40:42,241
I've been waiting 15 minutes.

825
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,034
You were 20 minutes early.

826
00:40:44,103 --> 00:40:47,310
I like to be
on time.

827
00:40:47,379 --> 00:40:50,172
You will be
in five more minutes.

828
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,862
He said it won't be
much longer now.

829
00:40:57,931 --> 00:41:00,379
You think this is
going to work?

830
00:41:00,448 --> 00:41:03,275
I know that
this all seems crazy.

831
00:41:03,344 --> 00:41:05,000
I mean, it seems crazy,

832
00:41:05,068 --> 00:41:06,896
but I don't know
what else to try...

833
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:11,275
I will try anything
that might help.

834
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:13,241
But you're going to do it, too,
right?

835
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,758
Yeah. Oh yeah.

836
00:41:14,827 --> 00:41:18,034
We are in this together.

837
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:20,793
Look, the thing is
just to keep an open mind.

838
00:41:20,862 --> 00:41:24,310
I heard about this doctor
from this friend...

839
00:41:24,379 --> 00:41:27,482
Ex-friend of mine...

840
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:28,862
And it kind of
worked for her.

841
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:32,034
What do you mean kind of?

842
00:41:32,103 --> 00:41:35,896
Well, my ex-friend,
she went through it,

843
00:41:35,965 --> 00:41:38,241
and found out
more about her real self,

844
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:43,241
and now she has devoted
the rest of her life to saving

845
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:45,137
the two-toed
pygmy newt of Borneo

846
00:41:45,206 --> 00:41:47,206
from extinction.

847
00:41:52,413 --> 00:41:54,586
Bill?

848
00:41:54,655 --> 00:41:56,379
Harley?

849
00:41:56,448 --> 00:41:59,103
It's been
a long time.

850
00:41:59,172 --> 00:42:01,344
I've been
out of the country.

851
00:42:01,413 --> 00:42:03,758
Borneo.

852
00:42:03,827 --> 00:42:06,655
And Kristin...How are you?

853
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:09,068
It's good
to see you, Harley.

854
00:42:09,137 --> 00:42:10,137
Thank you.

855
00:42:10,206 --> 00:42:12,586
You look wonderful.

856
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,655
You both do.

857
00:42:14,724 --> 00:42:17,275
Well, I've got to go.

858
00:42:17,344 --> 00:42:19,172
Oh, are you here to see...

859
00:42:21,068 --> 00:42:22,724
Oh, excellent.

860
00:42:22,793 --> 00:42:25,103
She changed my life.

861
00:42:25,172 --> 00:42:26,103
Bye.

862
00:42:28,689 --> 00:42:30,931
The doctor will see you now.

863
00:42:31,241 --> 00:42:34,724
Well, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

864
00:42:34,793 --> 00:42:36,551
Well, actually,
there's lots to be afraid of.

865
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,758
That's why
I don't leave this room.

866
00:42:37,827 --> 00:42:40,620
But there's nothing
to be afraid of

867
00:42:40,689 --> 00:42:42,000
as far as hypnotism
is concerned.

868
00:42:42,068 --> 00:42:44,482
Now, I believe
we're doing a double?

869
00:42:44,551 --> 00:42:46,551
Yes.

870
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,448
Excellent.

871
00:42:48,517 --> 00:42:49,655
I must warn you

872
00:42:49,724 --> 00:42:51,344
that no one can be sure

873
00:42:51,413 --> 00:42:52,551
what he will find
under past-life hypnosis,

874
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,172
but rest assured

875
00:42:54,241 --> 00:42:57,172
that what you find
is sure to be enlightening.

876
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,689
Shall we begin?

877
00:43:00,655 --> 00:43:01,310
Sure.

878
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:02,724
Okay.

879
00:43:02,793 --> 00:43:06,241
Now, I'd like you
to just sit back...

880
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:09,586
And relax.

881
00:43:09,655 --> 00:43:12,206
Gaze at the crystal,

882
00:43:12,275 --> 00:43:17,344
and listen only
to the sound of my voice.

883
00:43:17,413 --> 00:43:20,655
Hear only the sound of my voice.

884
00:43:20,724 --> 00:43:22,758
Hear just my voice

885
00:43:22,827 --> 00:43:29,517
and notice that your feet
and legs are feeling heavy...

886
00:43:29,586 --> 00:43:33,034
And your shoulders
are heavy also,

887
00:43:33,103 --> 00:43:34,551
and let them just rest,

888
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:37,172
and relax
as you hear my voice...

889
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:41,344
And even close your eyes
as you listen.

890
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:43,206
Your eyelids feel heavy.

891
00:43:45,724 --> 00:43:48,241
Relax.

892
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:51,241
Just relax...

893
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:54,758
And now you are sleeping...

894
00:43:54,827 --> 00:43:59,827
And you feel free.

895
00:43:59,896 --> 00:44:02,689
It feels like a dream.

896
00:44:02,758 --> 00:44:08,793
And you are free
to look within...

897
00:44:08,862 --> 00:44:10,448
And see...

898
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,275
Well, that's enough for today.

899
00:44:20,344 --> 00:44:24,137
Welcome back.

900
00:44:24,206 --> 00:44:26,172
Well, who'd like
to begin?

901
00:44:26,241 --> 00:44:28,103
Do you want to go?

902
00:44:28,172 --> 00:44:30,241
It was...

903
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:32,137
It was great.

904
00:44:32,206 --> 00:44:33,034
It was really interesting.

905
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,068
I was...

906
00:44:35,137 --> 00:44:37,862
I was a Roman.

907
00:44:37,931 --> 00:44:38,862
Then I was a...

908
00:44:38,931 --> 00:44:40,068
I was a knight.

909
00:44:40,137 --> 00:44:43,172
And I was a farmer.

910
00:44:43,241 --> 00:44:44,275
I was a pioneer.

911
00:44:44,344 --> 00:44:45,793
And I was this...

912
00:44:45,862 --> 00:44:46,793
Businessman--

913
00:44:46,862 --> 00:44:48,034
old, old-fashioned businessman.

914
00:44:49,655 --> 00:44:52,655
You didn't waste any time,
did you, you busy boy?

915
00:44:52,724 --> 00:44:56,344
Kristin,
did you experience any insights?

916
00:44:56,413 --> 00:45:01,068
I saw myself in the snow.

917
00:45:01,137 --> 00:45:03,344
You saw yourself in the snow?

918
00:45:03,413 --> 00:45:05,068
Yes.

919
00:45:05,137 --> 00:45:07,241
And what else?

920
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:08,379
Nothing else.

921
00:45:08,448 --> 00:45:09,931
I was in the snow.

922
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,655
Playing in the snow.

923
00:45:11,724 --> 00:45:14,172
It was white
all around me.

924
00:45:14,241 --> 00:45:16,931
I played in the snow.

925
00:45:18,965 --> 00:45:21,758
Well, I must say,

926
00:45:21,827 --> 00:45:25,034
I've never had a reading
like this before.

927
00:45:25,103 --> 00:45:28,379
In terms of an interpretation
of what that is,

928
00:45:28,448 --> 00:45:35,896
I think we can say that snow
is important to your identity.

929
00:45:38,137 --> 00:45:40,689
Ms. Lilly,
if a person has no past,

930
00:45:40,758 --> 00:45:43,827
not just can't remember,
but has none...

931
00:45:43,896 --> 00:45:45,896
Is that possible?

932
00:45:45,965 --> 00:45:51,068
Well, it would be very unusual.

933
00:45:51,137 --> 00:45:54,413
Can a person
just appear out of nowhere?

934
00:45:56,448 --> 00:45:58,896
You have to come
from somewhere.

935
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:01,620
We just don't know where yet.

936
00:46:01,689 --> 00:46:02,896
Here you are.

937
00:46:02,965 --> 00:46:04,172
You're a real person,
aren't you?

938
00:46:04,241 --> 00:46:07,034
Yes.

939
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,724
Yes, she is.

940
00:46:08,793 --> 00:46:11,827
She is a real person.

941
00:46:11,896 --> 00:46:16,034
Perhaps another session
might reveal more.

942
00:46:16,103 --> 00:46:19,896
Or you might try praying.

943
00:46:35,586 --> 00:46:38,172
Keep moving.

944
00:46:38,241 --> 00:46:40,482
Faster. Faster.

945
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,931
[ Cellphone ringing ]

946
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,344
What?

947
00:47:00,413 --> 00:47:02,034
Well, hello, Donald?

948
00:47:02,103 --> 00:47:03,206
May I call you Donald?

949
00:47:03,275 --> 00:47:04,206
You just did.

950
00:47:04,275 --> 00:47:07,344
Who is this?

951
00:47:07,413 --> 00:47:09,034
You're going to like
what you're about to hear.

952
00:47:09,103 --> 00:47:10,551
What? Like the sound
of me hanging up?

953
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:11,931
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

954
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,206
You know the
"piece of the pole" campaign?

955
00:47:14,275 --> 00:47:15,413
It's been a huge success...

956
00:47:15,482 --> 00:47:17,413
Yeah, I've heard that.

957
00:47:17,482 --> 00:47:19,655
Well, that's me,

958
00:47:19,724 --> 00:47:20,896
and at the rate
things are selling,

959
00:47:20,965 --> 00:47:22,689
by Christmas Eve,

960
00:47:22,758 --> 00:47:25,344
the north pole will just be
one big vacant lot...

961
00:47:25,413 --> 00:47:27,517
With a tremendous amount
of real estate potential.

962
00:47:27,586 --> 00:47:29,137
I know where you're heading.

963
00:47:29,206 --> 00:47:31,103
You do?

964
00:47:31,172 --> 00:47:32,655
Why would you call me

965
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:34,517
if you weren't
interested in...

966
00:47:34,586 --> 00:47:37,275
High-rise,
time-share condos.
High-rise,
time-share condos.

967
00:47:37,344 --> 00:47:38,793
Exactly!

968
00:47:38,862 --> 00:47:40,344
Two weeks of Christmas
any time...Year round.

969
00:47:40,413 --> 00:47:42,586
I like it.

970
00:47:42,655 --> 00:47:43,862
You do?

971
00:47:43,931 --> 00:47:45,034
I said that.

972
00:47:45,103 --> 00:47:46,517
Oh, of course you do.

973
00:47:46,586 --> 00:47:48,000
We'll call it

974
00:47:48,068 --> 00:47:50,689
"rudolfa's north pole hotel
and casino".

975
00:47:50,758 --> 00:47:53,172
You mean
"trump's north pole tower".

976
00:48:15,413 --> 00:48:18,206
Something doesn't feel
quite right this year.

977
00:48:18,275 --> 00:48:19,551
What's that?

978
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,068
Christmas.

979
00:48:25,965 --> 00:48:28,310
You know,
something's missing.

980
00:48:28,379 --> 00:48:31,310
Something about it
feels wrong.

981
00:48:31,379 --> 00:48:32,344
Like I feel

982
00:48:32,413 --> 00:48:34,103
something about me
is wrong.

983
00:48:34,172 --> 00:48:36,689
Kristin, I think--
I really think--

984
00:48:36,758 --> 00:48:39,517
it's just--
just the situation.

985
00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:42,482
No, I've been thinking, bill.

986
00:48:42,551 --> 00:48:45,172
I don't want to hurt anyone...

987
00:48:45,241 --> 00:48:46,931
But I don't know
if it good for any of US

988
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,448
for me to be here right now.

989
00:48:49,517 --> 00:48:54,413
Maybe the best thing is
for me to get away for a while.

990
00:48:54,482 --> 00:48:57,517
Kristin, what for?

991
00:48:57,586 --> 00:48:59,068
I don't know.

992
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:01,862
I seem to know less about myself
than ever before.

993
00:49:01,931 --> 00:49:04,275
I have absolutely
no idea who I am.

994
00:49:04,344 --> 00:49:06,586
I'm beginning to wonder
if I exist at all.

995
00:49:06,655 --> 00:49:10,241
Hey, hey, you exist.

996
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:12,448
You're here.

997
00:49:12,517 --> 00:49:14,620
I can touch you.

998
00:49:14,689 --> 00:49:16,241
You're real.

999
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:19,034
We have to face it.

1000
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,172
Something
is wrong, bill.

1001
00:49:21,241 --> 00:49:22,103
Something is wrong

1002
00:49:22,172 --> 00:49:23,551
when uncle Johnny

1003
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,275
thinks I'm a clone
or an alien,

1004
00:49:25,344 --> 00:49:27,137
and he might
be right.

1005
00:49:27,206 --> 00:49:28,344
Maybe if I get away,

1006
00:49:28,413 --> 00:49:30,793
I can find out
something about myself,

1007
00:49:30,862 --> 00:49:32,620
if that's all
I'm concentrating on.

1008
00:49:32,689 --> 00:49:34,862
No, Kristin.

1009
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:37,379
That is not
the answer.

1010
00:49:37,448 --> 00:49:39,862
Come on, let's not give up.

1011
00:49:39,931 --> 00:49:40,724
Something's going to break.

1012
00:49:40,793 --> 00:49:42,137
I know it will.

1013
00:49:42,206 --> 00:49:44,793
Leaving's
not going to solve anything.

1014
00:49:44,862 --> 00:49:47,965
Stay, okay?

1015
00:49:48,034 --> 00:49:49,931
We love you.

1016
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,137
And we want you here.

1017
00:49:51,206 --> 00:49:52,896
I want you here.

1018
00:49:52,965 --> 00:49:55,586
I promise you.

1019
00:49:55,655 --> 00:49:56,862
We'll find out

1020
00:49:56,931 --> 00:49:59,793
exactly who you are
before Christmas.

1021
00:49:59,862 --> 00:50:01,620
I'm trying to believe that.

1022
00:50:01,689 --> 00:50:03,137
So believe it.

1023
00:50:03,206 --> 00:50:07,103
Where is all this faith
you are always talking about?

1024
00:50:07,172 --> 00:50:10,344
Maybe it's time
you had a little faith yourself.

1025
00:51:04,413 --> 00:51:06,827
We don't care about the price.

1026
00:51:06,896 --> 00:51:08,517

Well,

00:51:49,275 --> 00:51:52,275
but my glasses aren't here,

1039
00:51:52,344 --> 00:51:54,000
nor are
any of the writing utensils

1040
00:51:54,068 --> 00:51:55,344
in my office.

1041
00:51:55,413 --> 00:51:57,241
And that's not all.

1042
00:51:57,310 --> 00:52:00,482
Many of the gifts
from the present room are gone,

1043
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:05,310
and several of my books
are missing.

1044
00:52:05,379 --> 00:52:07,724
Well, that is strange.

1045
00:52:07,793 --> 00:52:09,862
It would help to explain
some of the other things.

1046
00:52:09,931 --> 00:52:11,275
I've noticed

1047
00:52:11,344 --> 00:52:12,448
some of the things
from Kristin's room

1048
00:52:12,517 --> 00:52:14,241
are missing also.

1049
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:15,241
Kristin's room?

1050
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:16,862
Yes.

1051
00:52:16,931 --> 00:52:17,827
And whole sides of buildings
are missing.

1052
00:52:17,896 --> 00:52:20,448
So the pole
is disappearing.

1053
00:52:20,517 --> 00:52:23,000
Let's not jump
to any conclusions.

1054
00:52:23,068 --> 00:52:24,793
But I don't understand

1055
00:52:24,862 --> 00:52:25,758
why they don't
want me

1056
00:52:25,827 --> 00:52:29,448
to be Santa anymore.

1057
00:52:29,517 --> 00:52:31,689
It's true I've been
tardy on occasion,

1058
00:52:31,758 --> 00:52:35,896
but I've always
got the job done.

1059
00:52:35,965 --> 00:52:37,517
There is something
else as well.

1060
00:52:37,586 --> 00:52:39,275
What's that?

1061
00:52:39,344 --> 00:52:41,931
Most of your underwear
seems to be missing.

1062
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,482
They would do that?

1063
00:52:45,551 --> 00:52:46,689
And that's really how I work,

1064
00:52:46,758 --> 00:52:48,241
which I guess is a hold-over

1065
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:49,689
from when I was
a junior high school principal.

1066
00:52:49,758 --> 00:52:51,172
Which I had to stop.

1067
00:52:51,241 --> 00:52:52,448
This just seemed like
the most logical transition.

1068
00:52:52,517 --> 00:52:56,379
So, shall we get started?

1069
00:52:56,448 --> 00:52:58,275
Of course, you know

1070
00:52:58,344 --> 00:53:00,793
that everything
depends upon your colors.

1071
00:53:06,586 --> 00:53:08,344
Well, we're getting married
on Christmas day,

1072
00:53:08,413 --> 00:53:11,034
so I guess it's pretty much
all about red and green.

1073
00:53:11,103 --> 00:53:15,793
Yes, that would be
the "traditional" way to go...

1074
00:53:15,862 --> 00:53:17,413
Of course, there are

1075
00:53:17,482 --> 00:53:18,931
many different shades
of those colors.

1076
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:19,931
Okay.

1077
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,344
How about
one of the shades

1078
00:53:21,413 --> 00:53:24,862
that people usually
associate with Christmas?

1079
00:53:24,931 --> 00:53:26,379
Yes...

1080
00:53:26,448 --> 00:53:28,310
You are the client.

1081
00:53:28,379 --> 00:53:32,206
It is you two who are
getting married?

1082
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:33,172
Yeah.

1083
00:53:33,241 --> 00:53:34,137
We hope.

1084
00:53:34,206 --> 00:53:35,172
You hope?

1085
00:53:35,241 --> 00:53:36,344
The retainer is binding.

1086
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:37,827
Can we just
continue, please?

1087
00:53:37,896 --> 00:53:39,482
Of course.

1088
00:53:39,551 --> 00:53:41,206
Now, how many bridesmaids
are you planning?

1089
00:53:41,275 --> 00:53:43,620
Bridesmaids?

1090
00:53:43,689 --> 00:53:46,931
I really don't know
that many people.

1091
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,448
There's Brittany,
naturally.

1092
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:52,758
And no other
family or friends?

1093
00:53:52,827 --> 00:53:58,206
We always planned,
like, a small wedding.

1094
00:53:58,275 --> 00:54:00,379
My son, Kyle,
will be the best man.

1095
00:54:00,448 --> 00:54:02,068
My mom and dad,

1096
00:54:02,137 --> 00:54:03,620
maybe the kids'
uncle Johnny.

1097
00:54:03,689 --> 00:54:04,896
No one else on your side?

1098
00:54:04,965 --> 00:54:06,206
No family or friends?

1099
00:54:06,275 --> 00:54:08,413
No.

1100
00:54:08,482 --> 00:54:10,413
Well, why don't we

1101
00:54:10,482 --> 00:54:12,172
go into
the social hall?

1102
00:54:12,241 --> 00:54:15,620
I'm sure there is something
hat could be done in there.

1103
00:54:15,689 --> 00:54:17,379
Great.

1104
00:54:17,448 --> 00:54:18,413
Come with me.

1105
00:54:18,482 --> 00:54:19,586
Just kind of
go with me here.

1106
00:54:19,655 --> 00:54:20,931
I'm seeing
red and white,

1107
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,137
maybe a Christmas
tree here.

1108
00:54:22,206 --> 00:54:24,000
Kristin?

1109
00:54:24,068 --> 00:54:25,896
Bill, if you don't mind
just going ahead,

1110
00:54:25,965 --> 00:54:27,310
I'll be right in.

1111
00:54:27,379 --> 00:54:29,551
I just need a moment.

1112
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,517
Bill?

1113
00:54:31,586 --> 00:54:33,448
Coming.

1114
00:54:33,517 --> 00:54:34,655
Yes?

1115
00:55:03,448 --> 00:55:06,482
Lord, I ask for your help.

1116
00:55:06,551 --> 00:55:09,413
I pray for your guidance.

1117
00:55:09,482 --> 00:55:11,758
Please show me.

1118
00:55:11,827 --> 00:55:14,793
Help me know who I am.

1119
00:55:26,689 --> 00:55:29,551
Kristin?

1120
00:55:31,172 --> 00:55:33,275
Kristin?

1121
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:38,655
Hey.

1122
00:55:38,724 --> 00:55:40,206
I thought you were
going to come help me

1123
00:55:40,275 --> 00:55:41,310
in the social hall.

1124
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:42,965
I am. I'm ready.

1125
00:55:43,034 --> 00:55:44,310
That's good.

1126
00:55:44,379 --> 00:55:46,965
Did something happen?

1127
00:55:47,034 --> 00:55:48,551
Did you remember something?

1128
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:51,241
I remembered to have hope.

1129
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:52,827
I remembered to trust.

1130
00:55:52,896 --> 00:55:58,517
You know, Christmas is coming,
and I intend to marry you.

1131
00:55:58,586 --> 00:56:00,137
I intend to marry you very much.

1132
00:56:00,206 --> 00:56:02,172
Then we'd better hurry.

1133
00:56:02,241 --> 00:56:04,551
Um...

1134
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:07,206
Did I mention that my parents
are coming in a few days?

1135
00:56:07,275 --> 00:56:10,034
No, but I can't wait
to meet them.

1136
00:56:13,586 --> 00:56:14,586
Okay.

1137
00:56:22,482 --> 00:56:25,620
Very good. Very good.

1138
00:56:25,689 --> 00:56:27,827
Here's the contract
from Donald.

1139
00:56:34,344 --> 00:56:35,896
Outrageous!

1140
00:56:35,965 --> 00:56:38,310
This is not
what I agreed to.

1141
00:56:40,965 --> 00:56:42,275
Oh...

1142
00:56:42,344 --> 00:56:43,344
Oh, glitch.

1143
00:56:43,413 --> 00:56:44,379
What a surprise.

1144
00:56:44,448 --> 00:56:46,448
I wasn't expecting
to see you.

1145
00:56:46,517 --> 00:56:48,275
Give me a moment
to go fix myself.

1146
00:56:48,344 --> 00:56:50,068
No, no, no, no.
Don't bother.

1147
00:56:50,137 --> 00:56:52,482
I just came by
to give you my bill.

1148
00:56:52,551 --> 00:56:55,310
Bill?

1149
00:56:55,379 --> 00:56:56,517
I thought you and I

1150
00:56:56,586 --> 00:56:58,655
meant so much more
to each other than that.

1151
00:56:58,724 --> 00:57:00,310
I mean, we have
so much in common.

1152
00:57:00,379 --> 00:57:01,413
Destruction.

1153
00:57:01,482 --> 00:57:03,034
Megalomania.

1154
00:57:03,103 --> 00:57:05,206
We both love

1155
00:57:05,275 --> 00:57:07,448
to see other people
miserable.

1156
00:57:07,517 --> 00:57:10,620
It's true,
you're a fun date,

1157
00:57:10,689 --> 00:57:13,206
but I'm global.

1158
00:57:13,275 --> 00:57:14,896
You can't keep up.

1159
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,379
But can't we try?

1160
00:57:22,068 --> 00:57:23,862
Hurry up.

1161
00:57:23,931 --> 00:57:25,137
We're running out of time
before Christmas.

1162
00:57:25,206 --> 00:57:27,379
Oh, glitch? Glitch?

1163
00:57:30,068 --> 00:57:32,517
Whoa. Look at this stuff.

1164
00:57:32,586 --> 00:57:34,068
This is really cool.

1165
00:57:34,137 --> 00:57:36,379
She's going to love
this stuff.

1166
00:57:39,103 --> 00:57:40,896
This is beautiful.

1167
00:57:51,275 --> 00:57:53,034
"From daddy to Kristin,

1168
00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:54,517
"those who believe

1169
00:57:54,586 --> 00:57:55,896
are always rewarded
with the truth."

1170
00:57:55,965 --> 00:57:58,000
That's funny.

1171
00:57:58,068 --> 00:57:59,482
What?

1172
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,862
What's on this doll.

1173
00:58:00,931 --> 00:58:02,137
It's the exact same thing

1174
00:58:02,206 --> 00:58:04,413
Kristin said to me
the other day,

1175
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:05,551
and it's inscribed "to Kristin."

1176
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:09,310
Yeah, right.

1177
00:58:09,379 --> 00:58:12,241
"From daddy
to Kristin."

1178
00:58:13,965 --> 00:58:15,310
You know
something weird?

1179
00:58:17,758 --> 00:58:20,275
You think I'm right,
don't you?

1180
00:58:20,344 --> 00:58:21,931
You know it.
You feel it, too.

1181
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,758
Santa's daughter
is in the house.

1182
00:58:23,827 --> 00:58:25,068
I'm right, I'm right.

1183
00:58:25,137 --> 00:58:26,655
My brother believes me.
It's a miracle.

1184
00:58:26,724 --> 00:58:27,758
Right.

1185
00:58:27,827 --> 00:58:29,586
Oh, my god,
I'm right!

1186
00:58:29,655 --> 00:58:31,379
Calm down.

1187
00:58:31,448 --> 00:58:33,241
Let's just say
for a second that I do.

1188
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:34,517
Here's the problem.

1189
00:58:34,586 --> 00:58:35,517
What?

1190
00:58:35,586 --> 00:58:38,068
We can't tell anybody.

1191
00:58:38,137 --> 00:58:39,206
Why not?

1192
00:58:39,275 --> 00:58:40,724
Why not?

1193
00:58:40,793 --> 00:58:42,068
'Cause everybody
will think we're crazy.

1194
00:58:42,137 --> 00:58:43,034
That's why not.

1195
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:45,862
You're probably right.

1196
00:58:45,931 --> 00:58:47,241
No, I'm definitely right.

1197
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:49,448
You swear
you won't tell anybody?

1198
00:58:53,275 --> 00:58:54,379
Okay.

1199
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:56,034
It's for everybody's
own good.

1200
00:58:56,103 --> 00:58:57,896
I mean, I'm going
to high school next year.

1201
00:58:57,965 --> 00:58:59,413
I've got to start planning
my survival,

1202
00:58:59,482 --> 00:59:00,724
and telling people

1203
00:59:00,793 --> 00:59:02,241
that I live
with Santa's daughter

1204
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:04,137
probably not going to get me off
to the start I need.

1205
00:59:04,206 --> 00:59:05,586
But still...

1206
00:59:05,655 --> 00:59:08,137
It's the coolest secret
in the history of the world.

1207
00:59:18,724 --> 00:59:21,862
You two
are up early.

1208
00:59:21,931 --> 00:59:24,034
We have an early
Christmas present for you.

1209
00:59:24,103 --> 00:59:26,896
Well,
I think it's better to wait.

1210
00:59:26,965 --> 00:59:28,586
We think you'll
want to see this.

1211
00:59:28,655 --> 00:59:30,034
Okay.

1212
00:59:34,793 --> 00:59:36,482
"To the Kristin
we know and love.

1213
00:59:36,551 --> 00:59:38,206
Brittany and Kyle."

1214
00:59:39,793 --> 00:59:43,275
That is so sweet,
you guys.

1215
00:59:43,344 --> 00:59:45,482
I love you so much.

1216
01:00:33,724 --> 01:00:36,172
I'm Kristin.

1217
01:00:36,241 --> 01:00:39,758
Kristin claus.

1218
01:00:39,827 --> 01:00:42,000
I am Santa's daughter.

1219
01:00:42,068 --> 01:00:46,000
I was born and raised
at the north pole.

1220
01:00:46,068 --> 01:00:48,068
I'm in charge
of the mail department.

1221
01:00:48,137 --> 01:00:50,275
All the letters
from children all over the world

1222
01:00:50,344 --> 01:00:52,689
come to me.

1223
01:00:52,758 --> 01:00:54,620
I have...

1224
01:00:54,689 --> 01:00:56,000
I have powers.

1225
01:00:59,551 --> 01:01:01,172
♪ Don't think twice ♪

1226
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:03,413
♪ we don't care
about the price... ♪

1227
01:01:03,482 --> 01:01:06,793
I have a sister named "rudolfa".

1228
01:01:06,862 --> 01:01:11,241
♪ Buy a piece of the pole ♪

1229
01:01:11,379 --> 01:01:13,586
It's not too late.

1230
01:01:13,655 --> 01:01:15,517
You can still get
your piece of the pole,

1231
01:01:15,586 --> 01:01:18,000
though at this late date,
there isn't much left.

1232
01:01:20,206 --> 01:01:21,586
Who knows,

1233
01:01:21,655 --> 01:01:23,068
maybe Santa
will have to deliver

1234
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:24,689
your piece or artifact
himself.

1235
01:01:24,758 --> 01:01:27,000
After all,
what else is he doing?

1236
01:01:29,793 --> 01:01:32,103
Did this come from her?

1237
01:01:34,413 --> 01:01:35,344
Yeah.

1238
01:01:35,413 --> 01:01:36,724
It came with

1239
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:38,586
a few other pieces
of the pole.

1240
01:01:38,655 --> 01:01:40,482
We thought it would be
the perfect gift for you.

1241
01:01:40,551 --> 01:01:42,068
Everybody has them.

1242
01:01:42,137 --> 01:01:43,586
They're like
the hottest thing.

1243
01:01:43,655 --> 01:01:47,655
There must be thousands
of pieces of the pole here...

1244
01:01:47,724 --> 01:01:49,000
All over the world.

1245
01:01:49,068 --> 01:01:50,586
More like millions.

1246
01:01:50,655 --> 01:01:52,068
But what about
the north pole...

1247
01:01:52,137 --> 01:01:55,068
If all this stuff is here,
what's left there?

1248
01:01:55,137 --> 01:01:57,551
What about my mom and dad?

1249
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:59,413
It's almost Christmas Eve.

1250
01:01:59,482 --> 01:02:03,655
How can there be a Christmas
if there is no north pole?

1251
01:02:03,724 --> 01:02:05,413
I've got to get back
to the pole.

1252
01:02:05,482 --> 01:02:08,034
We have to go now.

1253
01:02:08,103 --> 01:02:09,034
We?

1254
01:02:09,103 --> 01:02:09,827
Of course "we".

1255
01:02:09,896 --> 01:02:11,275
We're a family, right?

1256
01:02:11,344 --> 01:02:12,758
We're going together.

1257
01:02:12,827 --> 01:02:13,724
Don't you want to go?

1258
01:02:13,793 --> 01:02:14,827
Are you kidding?

1259
01:02:14,896 --> 01:02:15,862
Go to the north pole?

1260
01:02:15,931 --> 01:02:17,620
Let's go!

1261
01:02:17,689 --> 01:02:19,172
This is great.

1262
01:02:19,241 --> 01:02:20,482
How do we get there?

1263
01:02:20,551 --> 01:02:22,827
I remember now.

1264
01:02:22,896 --> 01:02:24,137
I remember everything.

1265
01:02:24,206 --> 01:02:26,482
I know how to get US there.

1266
01:02:26,551 --> 01:02:29,172
Brittany, I am sorry
that I doubted you.

1267
01:02:29,241 --> 01:02:30,275
You were right.

1268
01:02:30,344 --> 01:02:31,827
It's not proof,
it's faith.

1269
01:02:31,896 --> 01:02:34,137
I just needed
more faith.

1270
01:02:34,206 --> 01:02:35,827
Oh, but we have to
tell your dad.

1271
01:02:35,896 --> 01:02:37,137
I can't wait to tell him.

1272
01:02:37,206 --> 01:02:39,172
I know who I am!

1273
01:02:44,896 --> 01:02:45,827
Bill!

1274
01:02:45,896 --> 01:02:46,931
Honey? Honey, wake up.

1275
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,448
Dad, we have
something to tell you.

1276
01:02:48,517 --> 01:02:49,551
What, what, what?

1277
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:50,896
What's wrong? What is it?

1278
01:02:54,551 --> 01:02:56,310
Hey, did you remember something?

1279
01:02:56,379 --> 01:02:58,137
I know, bill.
I know who I am.

1280
01:02:58,206 --> 01:02:58,965
That's great.

1281
01:03:01,827 --> 01:03:03,034
Who?

1282
01:03:03,103 --> 01:03:04,586
Brittany was right
all along.

1283
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:05,931
I'm Kristin claus.

1284
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,551
I'm Santa's daughter.

1285
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:08,724
I really am.

1286
01:03:08,793 --> 01:03:09,827
That's great.

1287
01:03:09,896 --> 01:03:11,448
It all came back to me

1288
01:03:11,517 --> 01:03:13,241
when the kids gave me the doll
they got from the north pole.

1289
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:14,689
It's my doll
from when I was small.

1290
01:03:14,758 --> 01:03:16,241
That's something.

1291
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:18,482
I'll tell you all about it,
but we have to go.

1292
01:03:18,551 --> 01:03:20,137
Okay.

1293
01:03:20,206 --> 01:03:21,103
And where are we going?

1294
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:23,137
The north pole.

1295
01:03:23,206 --> 01:03:25,000
The place is being sold off
by Kristin's sister, rudolfa.

1296
01:03:25,068 --> 01:03:26,068
And we have to
help Kristin

1297
01:03:26,137 --> 01:03:27,551
figure out what to do
to save it.

1298
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:28,931
With my sister

1299
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,206
selling off millions
of pieces of the place,

1300
01:03:30,275 --> 01:03:31,551
who knows what's left?

1301
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:32,310
Can you imagine?

1302
01:03:32,379 --> 01:03:34,206
I'm trying.

1303
01:03:34,275 --> 01:03:35,241
Everybody
has to get dressed.

1304
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:36,724
We've got to get going.

1305
01:03:36,793 --> 01:03:38,137
There's not
a moment to lose.

1306
01:03:38,206 --> 01:03:40,724
You don't know my sister.

1307
01:03:44,172 --> 01:03:47,137
Bill, Brittany,
are you guys ready?

1308
01:03:47,206 --> 01:03:50,689
Okay, okay, okay.

1309
01:03:50,758 --> 01:03:52,448
Here I am.

1310
01:03:52,517 --> 01:03:54,137
Are you all right?

1311
01:03:54,206 --> 01:03:56,206
Yeah, I'm fine.

1312
01:03:56,275 --> 01:03:57,758
I'm better
than all right.

1313
01:03:57,827 --> 01:03:59,206
We're getting married
for sure, right?

1314
01:03:59,275 --> 01:04:00,758
We know who you are.

1315
01:04:00,827 --> 01:04:02,344
I'm great.

1316
01:04:02,413 --> 01:04:05,758
You don't believe
I'm Santa's daughter, do you?

1317
01:04:07,758 --> 01:04:09,551
If that is who you say you are,

1318
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:12,034
then that is
who I believe you are.

1319
01:04:12,103 --> 01:04:14,275
Okay. Let's go.

1320
01:04:14,344 --> 01:04:15,448
Now we're going
to be back

1321
01:04:15,517 --> 01:04:16,827
in time for
the wedding, right?

1322
01:04:16,896 --> 01:04:19,068
'Cause my parents
are in town.

1323
01:04:19,137 --> 01:04:21,689
We're trying to save Christmas
right now, bill.

1324
01:04:21,758 --> 01:04:23,965
I want to be married to you
more than anything,

1325
01:04:24,034 --> 01:04:25,448
but at this moment,

1326
01:04:25,517 --> 01:04:27,655
there is something very serious
happening to my home,

1327
01:04:27,724 --> 01:04:30,931
and because my home
is the north pole,

1328
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,068
it's important to everybody.

1329
01:04:33,137 --> 01:04:34,689
We're going,

1330
01:04:34,758 --> 01:04:37,448
and if you believe
I am who I know I am,

1331
01:04:37,517 --> 01:04:38,413
you'll be going with US.

1332
01:04:38,482 --> 01:04:43,241
Okay. All right.

1333
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:45,413
I believe you.

1334
01:04:45,482 --> 01:04:47,758
Okay.

1335
01:04:47,827 --> 01:04:49,206
Brittany?

1336
01:04:52,379 --> 01:04:53,758
Okay, everybody,

1337
01:04:53,827 --> 01:04:57,448
ow, close your eyes,
and believe.

1338
01:04:57,517 --> 01:05:00,620
Believe.

1339
01:05:00,689 --> 01:05:02,517
Believe...

1340
01:05:03,517 --> 01:05:05,379
Believe.

1341
01:05:18,965 --> 01:05:21,655
Okay, Kristin?

1342
01:05:21,724 --> 01:05:22,758
Come on, guys.

1343
01:05:22,827 --> 01:05:25,758
The game is up, all right?

1344
01:05:25,827 --> 01:05:27,896
Guys?

1345
01:05:35,241 --> 01:05:38,517
Snow.

1346
01:05:47,413 --> 01:05:49,724
"From daddy to Kristin,

1347
01:05:49,793 --> 01:05:53,034
"those who believe

1348
01:05:53,103 --> 01:05:55,896
are always
rewarded with the truth."

1349
01:06:15,724 --> 01:06:16,896
This is
the north pole?

1350
01:06:16,965 --> 01:06:17,896
Forget merry.

1351
01:06:17,965 --> 01:06:19,344
This is
scary Christmas.

1352
01:06:19,413 --> 01:06:22,068
Where's dad?

1353
01:06:22,137 --> 01:06:23,448
Maybe my power

1354
01:06:23,517 --> 01:06:25,620
wasn't strong enough
to get US all here.

1355
01:06:25,689 --> 01:06:29,000
Well, I'm going
to remember everything

1356
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:30,172
so I can tell him
about it

1357
01:06:30,241 --> 01:06:31,724
when we get back.

1358
01:06:31,793 --> 01:06:33,655
Me too,

1359
01:06:33,724 --> 01:06:35,448
although I may leave
this part out.

1360
01:06:35,517 --> 01:06:38,137
Yeah.
It's worse than I thought.

1361
01:06:38,206 --> 01:06:39,206
Dad?

1362
01:06:39,275 --> 01:06:41,103
Mom?

1363
01:06:41,172 --> 01:06:43,586
Come with me.

1364
01:06:50,034 --> 01:06:52,310
Dad!

1365
01:06:52,379 --> 01:06:53,551
No, no it couldn't be.

1366
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:55,448
Dad, it's me.
It's Kristin.

1367
01:06:55,517 --> 01:06:56,379
Kristin.

1368
01:06:56,448 --> 01:06:57,482
Are you back?

1369
01:06:57,551 --> 01:06:58,586
Have you come back?

1370
01:06:58,655 --> 01:06:59,620
Yes, dad. I'm here.

1371
01:06:59,689 --> 01:07:01,551
What can I do?

1372
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:04,034
There's nothing
that can be done.

1373
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:05,655
But where's mother?

1374
01:07:05,724 --> 01:07:07,413
She's packing what little
they've left US.

1375
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:09,241
We're leaving.

1376
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:11,310
Everyone else
has already gone...

1377
01:07:11,379 --> 01:07:15,206
I guess I knew this
would happen one day.

1378
01:07:15,275 --> 01:07:17,965
The new Santa is
out there right now,

1379
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:21,275
getting the gifts ready,

1380
01:07:21,344 --> 01:07:22,517
making people happy,

1381
01:07:22,586 --> 01:07:23,413
just like I used to do.

1382
01:07:23,482 --> 01:07:25,034
What new Santa?

1383
01:07:25,103 --> 01:07:28,206
When they don't want you,
it's cruel,

1384
01:07:28,275 --> 01:07:30,517
even for Santa,

1385
01:07:30,586 --> 01:07:32,655
but I had a long run,

1386
01:07:32,724 --> 01:07:34,517
but you lose a step...

1387
01:07:34,586 --> 01:07:36,931
And they push you
down the stairs.

1388
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,413
Dad, that's not true.

1389
01:07:39,482 --> 01:07:41,448
Is that what you think
is going on?

1390
01:07:41,517 --> 01:07:43,965
It isn't.

1391
01:07:44,034 --> 01:07:44,965
Dad, it's...

1392
01:07:45,034 --> 01:07:46,206
It's rudolfa...

1393
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:48,034
I know she's done

1394
01:07:48,103 --> 01:07:50,206
her fair share of mischief
in the past.

1395
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:51,931
But, no, this time, it's me.

1396
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,896
I've done something
to deserve this,

1397
01:07:53,965 --> 01:07:57,862
but i--
I don't know what it is.

1398
01:07:57,931 --> 01:08:01,344
Ooh!

1399
01:08:03,448 --> 01:08:04,655
Dad, I'd like you to meet--

1400
01:08:04,724 --> 01:08:06,310
Kyle and Brittany.

1401
01:08:06,379 --> 01:08:10,206
Beautiful children.

1402
01:08:10,275 --> 01:08:11,827
Oh, dear.

1403
01:08:11,896 --> 01:08:13,896
I don't have
the littlest thing

1404
01:08:13,965 --> 01:08:15,758
to give them
for Christmas.

1405
01:08:15,827 --> 01:08:17,000
It's so embarrassing.

1406
01:08:17,068 --> 01:08:18,655
Dad, now, don't you worry.

1407
01:08:18,724 --> 01:08:20,206
It's not even
Christmas Eve yet.

1408
01:08:20,275 --> 01:08:23,448
I want you to do
what you always taught me--

1409
01:08:23,517 --> 01:08:24,482
have hope.

1410
01:08:24,551 --> 01:08:26,000
Have faith.

1411
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:29,103
"Those who believe
are rewarded with the truth."

1412
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:30,344
What you're saying is

1413
01:08:30,413 --> 01:08:32,310
that even I
don't believe in Santa

1414
01:08:32,379 --> 01:08:35,379
if this is my reward.

1415
01:08:35,448 --> 01:08:37,827
Dad, you are Santa claus.

1416
01:08:37,896 --> 01:08:40,103
Don't ever forget who you are.

1417
01:08:40,172 --> 01:08:41,413
And it isn't because

1418
01:08:41,482 --> 01:08:44,172
you have a white beard
and wear a red suit.

1419
01:08:44,241 --> 01:08:46,379
It's because in your eyes

1420
01:08:46,448 --> 01:08:48,862
are the hopes
of millions of children.

1421
01:08:48,931 --> 01:08:50,103
On your shoulders

1422
01:08:50,172 --> 01:08:52,000
is the weight
of millions of dreams

1423
01:08:52,068 --> 01:08:53,344
waiting to be delivered.

1424
01:08:53,413 --> 01:08:58,137
You are so important
to the world, dad,

1425
01:08:58,206 --> 01:09:00,137
not only because you give,

1426
01:09:00,206 --> 01:09:04,068
but because you show others
what it is to give.

1427
01:09:04,137 --> 01:09:07,758
That's who Santa claus is
and that's who you are,

1428
01:09:07,827 --> 01:09:12,827
and that's why we have to get
the north pole back for you.

1429
01:09:12,896 --> 01:09:17,034
Oh, Kristin.

1430
01:09:17,103 --> 01:09:18,068
Don't worry, dad.

1431
01:09:18,137 --> 01:09:19,758
I'll take care of it.

1432
01:09:19,827 --> 01:09:23,517
I'm so glad we've been able
to come to an agreement, Donald,

1433
01:09:23,586 --> 01:09:26,344
finally.

1434
01:09:26,413 --> 01:09:27,965
I've got to go.

1435
01:09:28,034 --> 01:09:29,965
Kristin!

1436
01:09:30,034 --> 01:09:32,310
How surprising
to see you.

1437
01:09:32,379 --> 01:09:35,103
New year. Same you.

1438
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:38,896
Have you taken up haiku
since you abandoned US?

1439
01:09:38,965 --> 01:09:41,517
You won't
get away with this.

1440
01:09:41,586 --> 01:09:43,517
That old song.

1441
01:09:43,586 --> 01:09:45,068
Take a look around,
Kristin.

1442
01:09:45,137 --> 01:09:46,551
I've already gotten
away with it.

1443
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:48,482
Did you notice?

1444
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:52,241
There's almost nothing left
of your precious pole.

1445
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:54,655
I saw it.

1446
01:09:54,724 --> 01:09:55,551
So perfect.

1447
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:57,068
Everybody wanted

1448
01:09:57,137 --> 01:09:59,034
his or her own
piece of the pole.

1449
01:09:59,103 --> 01:10:00,896
"Believe this, believe that."

1450
01:10:00,965 --> 01:10:03,068
It's all talk, really.

1451
01:10:03,137 --> 01:10:04,620
What they care about

1452
01:10:04,689 --> 01:10:06,551
is having something
they can hold in their hands.

1453
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:07,827
Right, kids?

1454
01:10:07,896 --> 01:10:10,275
Makes you feel good?

1455
01:10:10,344 --> 01:10:12,827
Then brick by brick, bye-bye.

1456
01:10:12,896 --> 01:10:13,724
We just thought

1457
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:15,068
it would be
a nice gift.

1458
01:10:15,137 --> 01:10:18,448
Santa claus isn't going anywhere
this year.

1459
01:10:18,517 --> 01:10:20,586
The sleigh
is in a hundred pieces

1460
01:10:20,655 --> 01:10:22,965
spread out
in the grubby little hands

1461
01:10:23,034 --> 01:10:24,068
of half a dozen countries.

1462
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:25,620
And the reindeer?

1463
01:10:25,689 --> 01:10:28,551
I sold them
to a collector in Ohio.

1464
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:29,931
Bought the whole set.

1465
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,586
The reindeer are gone?

1466
01:10:31,655 --> 01:10:33,172
Filthy animals.

1467
01:10:33,241 --> 01:10:34,931
I say "good riddance."

1468
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,482
It's all been sold.

1469
01:10:37,551 --> 01:10:38,862
Why not?

1470
01:10:38,931 --> 01:10:40,103
People greedy
for Christmas

1471
01:10:40,172 --> 01:10:41,724
bought it all,

1472
01:10:41,793 --> 01:10:46,172
and while they were buying it,
they destroyed it.

1473
01:10:46,241 --> 01:10:47,758
So now...

1474
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:51,655
Rudolfa and Donald's
hotel and casino is going up.

1475
01:10:53,655 --> 01:10:56,000
We're paving paradise
and putting up a parking lot--

1476
01:10:56,068 --> 01:10:57,862
several, in fact.

1477
01:10:57,931 --> 01:10:59,689
My guess is

1478
01:10:59,758 --> 01:11:02,620
the same people that bought
the pieces of the pole

1479
01:11:02,689 --> 01:11:04,655
will be the ones
that will make the trek here

1480
01:11:04,724 --> 01:11:07,551
to stay at the hotel.

1481
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:09,034
By the way, do you know
who owns the south pole?

1482
01:11:09,103 --> 01:11:11,206
Because
at this point in my career,

1483
01:11:11,275 --> 01:11:12,344
I don't know,

1484
01:11:12,413 --> 01:11:16,724
I feel the need
to go...Really global.

1485
01:11:16,793 --> 01:11:18,379
Well, I can find out.

1486
01:11:18,448 --> 01:11:20,137
Because when
you're hot in this business,

1487
01:11:20,206 --> 01:11:21,655
you have to keep on the move.

1488
01:11:21,724 --> 01:11:24,965
They've got
all those penguins up there.

1489
01:11:25,034 --> 01:11:27,000
I can probably
sell those off like chickens.

1490
01:11:27,068 --> 01:11:29,965
Once the birds are gone,
the building begins.

1491
01:11:33,379 --> 01:11:34,931
Wow. That was
your sister?

1492
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:35,896
Good ol' sis.

1493
01:11:35,965 --> 01:11:38,310

Where are the Kristin

1503
01:12:10,241 --> 01:12:11,551
Gone.

1504
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:16,310
"Gone" as in shopping?
Or gone as in..."Gone"?

1505
01:12:16,379 --> 01:12:20,931
Gone as in...

You know what?

1507
01:12:22,586 --> 01:12:24,379
I'm not even sure
that "gone" really covers it.

01:12:24,448 --> 01:12:26,172
Boy, that's bad.

1509
01:12:26,241 --> 01:12:28,172
"Gone" covers a lot.

01:12:28,241 --> 01:12:29,379
I don't know
how this could be...

1511
01:12:29,448 --> 01:12:30,689

Do you mind if I sit?

01:12:34,413 --> 01:12:36,551

1527
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:41,896
We're going to broadcast
one last time.

1528
01:13:41,965 --> 01:13:44,724
Standby for transmission.

1529
01:13:48,068 --> 01:13:52,724
There is one thing
we might be able to do.

1530
01:13:54,241 --> 01:13:55,586
Oh, wahoo?

1531
01:13:57,724 --> 01:13:59,172
Kristin?

1532
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:16,310
We have to figure
this thing out,

1533
01:14:16,379 --> 01:14:17,310
and fast.

1534
01:14:17,379 --> 01:14:18,310
That's right.

1535
01:14:18,379 --> 01:14:19,827
For a limited time,

1536
01:14:19,896 --> 01:14:23,827
you too
can own a piece of the pole.

1537
01:14:23,896 --> 01:14:25,241
I love her.

1538
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:27,517
I know that.

1539
01:14:27,586 --> 01:14:31,172
And I was here when they...

1540
01:14:31,241 --> 01:14:32,517
When they disappeared in that...

1541
01:14:32,586 --> 01:14:34,827
That swirl of snow.

1542
01:14:34,896 --> 01:14:36,275
I saw that.

1543
01:14:36,344 --> 01:14:39,827
So...that must be...

1544
01:14:39,896 --> 01:14:41,344
Some kind of proof

1545
01:14:41,413 --> 01:14:46,034
that Kristin is...

1546
01:14:46,103 --> 01:14:48,000
That Kristin
is Santa's daughter.

1547
01:14:48,068 --> 01:14:51,172
What?

1548
01:14:51,241 --> 01:14:53,344
That's the only thing
that makes sense.

1549
01:14:53,413 --> 01:14:55,862
That makes sense
and cloning doesn't?

1550
01:14:55,931 --> 01:14:57,620
Johnny, she comes
out of nowhere, right?

1551
01:14:57,689 --> 01:14:59,344
She shows up here

1552
01:14:59,413 --> 01:15:03,068
with a big red velvet bag
for her luggage.

1553
01:15:03,137 --> 01:15:05,586
She's an expert
on Christmas.

1554
01:15:05,655 --> 01:15:07,448
Her favorite colors
are red and green.

1555
01:15:07,517 --> 01:15:11,655
I mean, her favorite song
is "silent night".

1556
01:15:11,724 --> 01:15:14,241
She's the most loving,
the most forgiving person

1557
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:16,620
I've ever met...

1558
01:15:16,689 --> 01:15:19,965
And her name is Kristin claus.

1559
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:25,724
You lucky...

1560
01:15:25,793 --> 01:15:27,206
And you know what?

1561
01:15:27,275 --> 01:15:28,827
Now that I know it,

1562
01:15:28,896 --> 01:15:29,689
I know I've known it
all along.

1563
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:31,413
I just--

1564
01:15:31,482 --> 01:15:33,000
I was afraid
to admit it.

1565
01:15:33,068 --> 01:15:34,862
You're losing me.

1566
01:15:34,931 --> 01:15:36,413
Well, I love her.

1567
01:15:36,482 --> 01:15:38,000
But to be married
to Santa's daughter?

1568
01:15:38,068 --> 01:15:39,310
That's a little strange,
don't you think?

1569
01:15:39,379 --> 01:15:44,620
Yeah, that is strange...

1570
01:15:44,689 --> 01:15:47,896
Think of the story
in the tabloids.

1571
01:15:47,965 --> 01:15:51,103
Johnny, if you want
to spend another minute

1572
01:15:51,172 --> 01:15:52,551
under this roof,

1573
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:55,758
don't even
think that again.

1574
01:15:58,034 --> 01:15:59,344
Oh, my god, you're right.

1575
01:15:59,413 --> 01:16:01,689
If we get married,

1576
01:16:01,758 --> 01:16:02,931
then Kristin

1577
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,034
could never even
breathe a word

1578
01:16:04,103 --> 01:16:07,517
of who she really is...

1579
01:16:07,586 --> 01:16:09,413
Please stand by what?

1580
01:16:09,482 --> 01:16:11,206
The thing is

1581
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:12,517
that the north pole

1582
01:16:12,586 --> 01:16:14,517
doesn't belong
to any one person.

1583
01:16:14,586 --> 01:16:16,448
It can't,

1584
01:16:16,517 --> 01:16:18,206
because it already belongs
to everyone--

1585
01:16:18,275 --> 01:16:20,793
to everyone who believes,

1586
01:16:20,862 --> 01:16:22,413
and it can only exist

1587
01:16:22,482 --> 01:16:25,413
if everyone believes
in the whole thing together.

1588
01:16:25,482 --> 01:16:28,931
That's what makes
the north pole powerful.

1589
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,310
That's what makes it important.

1590
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:35,482
It's everyone believing
together.

1591
01:16:35,551 --> 01:16:37,827
But now with people having

1592
01:16:37,896 --> 01:16:40,724
their own little
"piece of the pole,"

1593
01:16:40,793 --> 01:16:43,517
wanting it for themselves,

1594
01:16:43,586 --> 01:16:45,448
it's been lost.

1595
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:48,241
There is only one hope.

1596
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:51,413
It's going to take everyone
believing with me.

1597
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:54,931
Everyone who has
a piece of the north pole,

1598
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,689
you have to get
your piece of the north pole

1599
01:16:57,758 --> 01:16:59,655
and put it in your hand,

1600
01:16:59,724 --> 01:17:04,379
and you have to believe
very hard.

1601
01:17:04,448 --> 01:17:06,344
You have to believe

1602
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:09,482
with everything
you have in you.

1603
01:17:09,551 --> 01:17:11,551
You have to believe
in the north pole

1604
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:14,172
and Santa claus and Christmas.

1605
01:17:14,241 --> 01:17:22,206
You have to close your eyes
and see with your heart,

1606
01:17:22,275 --> 01:17:25,482
and maybe a miracle
will happen.

1607
01:17:25,551 --> 01:17:28,379
Believe.

1608
01:17:28,448 --> 01:17:31,689
Believe...

1609
01:17:31,758 --> 01:17:37,206
Believe...

1610
01:17:37,275 --> 01:17:39,034
Believe...

1611
01:17:39,103 --> 01:17:44,206
Believe...

1612
01:17:44,275 --> 01:17:46,379
Believe very hard.

1613
01:17:48,896 --> 01:17:52,620
Believe with me...

1614
01:17:52,689 --> 01:17:55,241
Believe with all your heart...

1615
01:18:01,413 --> 01:18:02,965
Thank you.

1616
01:18:06,103 --> 01:18:09,793
She's the world's
most incredible person,

1617
01:18:09,862 --> 01:18:12,344
and she loves me,

1618
01:18:12,413 --> 01:18:16,448
and I'm sitting here
wondering about what?

1619
01:18:16,517 --> 01:18:18,586
This doesn't matter.

1620
01:18:18,655 --> 01:18:19,551
'Cause we're going to get
through this,

1621
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:21,206
no matter what,

1622
01:18:21,275 --> 01:18:22,241
because we're all
going to have each other,

1623
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:24,241
and that's what matters.

1624
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:26,448
That's the only thing
that counts.

1625
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:37,827
Okay...

1626
01:18:37,896 --> 01:18:39,965
I believe.

1627
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:49,827
Bill!

1628
01:18:49,896 --> 01:18:50,379
Daddy!

1629
01:18:50,448 --> 01:18:51,965
Dad!

1630
01:18:54,724 --> 01:18:56,275
Oh, guys!

1631
01:18:56,344 --> 01:19:00,172
I'm sorry
I didn't believe before,

1632
01:19:00,241 --> 01:19:01,655
but I do now.

1633
01:19:01,724 --> 01:19:04,413
I believe in you,
and in US, and in this,

1634
01:19:04,482 --> 01:19:05,586
more than I ever
thought I possibly could.

1635
01:19:05,655 --> 01:19:06,896
I know you do.

1636
01:19:06,965 --> 01:19:09,724
You couldn't have gotten here
if you didn't.

1637
01:19:12,344 --> 01:19:14,689
Well, nice try, Kristin.

1638
01:19:14,758 --> 01:19:16,241
Too bad it didn't work.

1639
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:19,034
Bill...

1640
01:19:19,103 --> 01:19:22,931
This is my sister, rudolfa.

1641
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:27,068
Are you kidding?

1642
01:19:27,137 --> 01:19:28,689
It's nice
to meet you.

1643
01:19:31,413 --> 01:19:33,172
Hey, look.

1644
01:19:41,655 --> 01:19:42,620
What is it?

1645
01:19:42,689 --> 01:19:44,034
The pieces
of the pole.

1646
01:19:44,103 --> 01:19:45,068
They're
coming home.

1647
01:20:04,655 --> 01:20:05,862
No, no, no, no!

1648
01:20:51,724 --> 01:20:54,482
Oh, no, no, no, no!
I don't believe this!

1649
01:20:54,551 --> 01:20:56,862
When am I ever going to
catch a break?

1650
01:21:07,586 --> 01:21:09,172
Kristin!

1651
01:21:09,241 --> 01:21:11,896
What happened?

1652
01:21:11,965 --> 01:21:15,103
We don't even have time
to tell you right now, dad.

1653
01:21:15,172 --> 01:21:16,379
Christmas is saved.

1654
01:21:16,448 --> 01:21:18,000
You have to
get going.

1655
01:21:21,241 --> 01:21:23,137
Well, this is
wonderful!

1656
01:21:25,310 --> 01:21:26,620
Even better.

1657
01:21:26,689 --> 01:21:29,103
Rudolfa!

1658
01:21:29,172 --> 01:21:30,689
The reindeer
aren't back yet.

1659
01:21:30,758 --> 01:21:32,655
I know.

1660
01:21:32,724 --> 01:21:35,000
I'll go get in the harness.

1661
01:21:39,965 --> 01:21:42,137
I thought I burnt this.

1662
01:21:42,206 --> 01:21:45,896
Merry Christmas, dad.

1663
01:21:45,965 --> 01:21:50,551
It will be now--
a merry Christmas for US all.

1664
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:51,896
You've done it, Kristin.

1665
01:21:51,965 --> 01:21:57,034
Dad, this is bill.

1666
01:21:57,103 --> 01:21:58,827
Hello, bill.

1667
01:21:58,896 --> 01:22:00,551
Welcome to the family.

1668
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:03,000
Thank you, Santa.

1669
01:22:03,068 --> 01:22:06,068
I just said that,
didn't I?

1670
01:22:06,137 --> 01:22:07,965
Quickly!
Help me fill up the sleigh.

1671
01:22:08,034 --> 01:22:09,931
We've got the presents
in the present room.

1672
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,655
Come on, let's go.

1673
01:22:14,241 --> 01:22:16,137
[ Santa ]: Merry Christmas!

1674
01:22:19,206 --> 01:22:21,137
Lead the way, rudolfa.

1675
01:22:25,034 --> 01:22:27,137
Merry Christmas!

1676
01:22:29,862 --> 01:22:32,724
You have committed
to each other

1677
01:22:32,793 --> 01:22:34,103
to share,

1678
01:22:34,172 --> 01:22:35,103
to listen,

1679
01:22:35,172 --> 01:22:36,586
to love.

1680
01:22:36,655 --> 01:22:40,655
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1681
01:23:38,275 --> 01:23:40,413
Do you want to make
these introductions

1682
01:23:40,482 --> 01:23:42,310
or should I?

1683
01:23:42,379 --> 01:23:43,827
Maybe both of US.

1684
01:23:43,896 --> 01:23:45,724
Together.

1685
01:23:48,068 --> 01:23:49,862
Mom, dad?

1686
01:23:49,931 --> 01:23:51,137
Come here.

1687
01:23:51,206 --> 01:23:53,965
I want you
to meet someone.

1688
01:23:54,034 --> 01:23:55,862
These are
Kristin's parents.

1689
01:23:55,931 --> 01:23:57,586
Hamilton and Joan,

1690
01:23:57,655 --> 01:23:59,655
this is my father,
Santa claus,

1691
01:23:59,724 --> 01:24:02,137
and my mom,
Clara claus.

1692
01:24:02,206 --> 01:24:02,724
Hi.

1693
01:24:02,793 --> 01:24:03,689
Hello.

1694
01:24:03,758 --> 01:24:05,896
Very pleased to meet you, Santa.

1695
01:24:05,965 --> 01:24:10,034
Pleasure to meet you, Hamilton.

1696
01:24:10,103 --> 01:24:13,896
That's a very pretty dress
you're wearing, Clara.

1697
01:24:13,965 --> 01:24:15,448
Thank you.
I've had it forever.

1698
01:24:15,517 --> 01:24:18,068
Oh.

1699
01:24:23,241 --> 01:24:25,034
So...

1700
01:24:25,103 --> 01:24:27,034
Why don't we go eat?

1701
01:24:27,103 --> 01:24:29,517
Sounds like a good idea.

1702
01:24:29,586 --> 01:24:31,137
I have a complaint.

1703
01:24:31,206 --> 01:24:32,586
I didn't get
what I wanted

1704
01:24:32,655 --> 01:24:35,724
for Christmas
this year, Santa.

1705
01:24:35,793 --> 01:24:37,862
Well, don't be
too surprised.

1706
01:24:37,931 --> 01:24:39,551
You weren't
very nice this year...

1707
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:41,482
Not very nice at all,
I'm afraid.

1708
01:24:41,551 --> 01:24:43,620
What do you mean by that?

1709
01:24:43,689 --> 01:24:45,931
Now, dad...

1710
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,724
Well, he asked me.

1711
01:24:47,793 --> 01:24:49,206
The man comes
to his own daughter's wedding

1712
01:24:49,275 --> 01:24:50,586
dressed in a Santa suit.

1713
01:24:50,655 --> 01:24:51,724
What is that?

1714
01:24:51,793 --> 01:24:53,241
Some kind
of a joke?

1715
01:24:53,310 --> 01:24:55,000
I assure you, sir, it is not.

1716
01:24:55,068 --> 01:24:57,551
I don't think I like your tone.

1717
01:24:57,620 --> 01:24:58,724
It's people like you

1718
01:24:58,793 --> 01:24:59,724
that make my job
so difficult.

1719
01:24:59,793 --> 01:25:01,413
People like me?

1720
01:25:01,482 --> 01:25:02,793
You don't even know
people like me, I'm sure.

1721
01:25:02,862 --> 01:25:04,310
Dad...

1722
01:25:04,379 --> 01:25:06,517
Can talk
about this later?

1723
01:25:06,586 --> 01:25:11,344
Well, now,
isn't this going to be fun?

1724
01:25:11,413 --> 01:25:13,413
We could all
do better.

1725
01:25:13,482 --> 01:25:16,586
That's what I meant.

1726
01:25:16,655 --> 01:25:18,689
Thank you.

1727
01:25:18,758 --> 01:25:19,793
Ahem.

1728
01:25:21,758 --> 01:25:25,275
Yes, well, I suppose we could.

1729
01:25:25,344 --> 01:25:27,034
Come on, dear.

1730
01:25:29,655 --> 01:25:32,862
How about a final photo
with your favorite uncle?

1731
01:25:40,344 --> 01:25:41,551
You okay?

1732
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:42,620
Yeah.

1733
01:25:44,137 --> 01:25:46,137
This is our best
Christmas ever.

1734
01:25:46,206 --> 01:25:48,206
Merry Christmas to all of US

1735
01:25:48,275 --> 01:25:50,344
and for all the Christmas's
to come.
