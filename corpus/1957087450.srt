 Shit.

 You okay, man?

 What took you so long?

   - It's better now.

14
00:01:35,494 --> 00:01:37,963

15
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,064
  - I don't know, man.

16
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:41,433
 It's like an old mine
 shaft or something.

17
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,768
 - No.

18
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:43,902
   Not way out in the middle,

00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:45,370
   holy shit!

20
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:50,442
- That thing is awesome.

21
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,843
 What is that?

22
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:56,949
   It's like a real dead guy.

23
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,522
 - What the hell is this place?

24
00:02:07,092 --> 00:02:08,360
- Oh my.

25
00:02:08,427 --> 00:02:10,462
 Look at the tits on that one.

26
00:02:10,529 --> 00:02:12,631
  - No seriously,
  what is this place?

27
00:02:12,698 --> 00:02:14,900
   - It's pretty spooky, man.

28
00:02:19,838 --> 00:02:21,373
  Woah, man. Get your
  light over here.

29
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,841
Check this out.

30
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:25,611
  Let's see if we can
  move this thing.

31
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:26,745
- Hey, hey, hey.

32
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:28,814
I wouldn't be moving
that door if I were you.

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,382
- You're such a pussy sometimes.

34
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:32,684
   Come on, man. Help me out.

35
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:37,589
   - Hey, watch out!

36
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:39,558
   (rumbling)

37
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,569
   (screams)

38
00:02:56,441 --> 00:03:00,445
   (screams)

39
00:03:03,715 --> 00:03:07,552
   (suspenseful exotic music)

40
00:05:24,723 --> 00:05:29,161
  (rock music)

41
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,037
   - [Sam] The victim died of
   massive internal trauma.

42
00:06:12,103 --> 00:06:14,239
  How do you even know
  this site is safe?

43
00:06:14,306 --> 00:06:15,841
  - [Swartek] Because it's my
  job to know how to secure

44
00:06:15,907 --> 00:06:17,843
 an archaeological find, okay?

45
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:20,178
 Now, if I need to ever
 conduct an autopsy,

46
00:06:20,245 --> 00:06:22,113
I'll be sure to give you a call.

47
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,915
   - I'm the coroner in this!

48
00:06:23,982 --> 00:06:25,016
   You see what I'm
   dealing with here?

49
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,117
 - Sam.

50
00:06:26,184 --> 00:06:28,019
   Sam, it's alright.

51
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,856
 Now look, the last
 thing any of us wants

52
00:06:30,922 --> 00:06:32,190
  is another accident.

53
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:33,592
   I just think you should
   consider stopping the work

54
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:36,862
  here until we can be assured
  that your kids will be safe.

55
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:40,332
 - Sheriff, this is a sensitive
 historical discovery.

56
00:06:40,398 --> 00:06:42,968
 Okay, I will not allow
 untrained personnel

57
00:06:43,034 --> 00:06:44,803
to disturb any of the artifacts.

58
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,138
   - Where do you get
   the authority?!

59
00:06:47,205 --> 00:06:48,306
- The governor's office,

60
00:06:48,373 --> 00:06:49,507
 National Park Service,

61
00:06:49,574 --> 00:06:51,977
   Secretary of the
   Interior, take your pick.

62
00:06:52,043 --> 00:06:53,812
Need I remind either one of you

63
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,948
 that we're discussing
 federal land here?

64
00:06:57,015 --> 00:06:59,317
  - No sir, you don't
  need to remind me.

65
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:01,686
   This ain't my first rodeo.

66
00:07:01,753 --> 00:07:04,222
   But let's be clear
   about something.

67
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:06,157
  Federal jurisdiction or not.

68
00:07:06,224 --> 00:07:09,828
   If I decide that this site
   is a danger to the public,

69
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:12,631
including you and your students,

70
00:07:12,697 --> 00:07:14,766
 I'm shutting you down.

71
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,601
 - Got it. Understand.

72
00:07:18,436 --> 00:07:20,005
- Good.

73
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:23,575
 Come on, Sam.

74
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:27,979
  Take care of yourself, miss.

75
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:29,347
  Be careful.

76
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:31,616
- Molly.

77
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:33,685
  - Professor Swartek.

78
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:34,953
 - Hey.

79
00:07:36,454 --> 00:07:38,890
   - What was that all about?

80
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:40,258
 - Oh, nothing.

81
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:42,360
   You know, just the usual.

82
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:45,030
 Dealing with the bureaucracy.

83
00:07:46,831 --> 00:07:49,668
   So'd you have any trouble
   finding the place?

84
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:50,335
 - No.

85
00:07:50,402 --> 00:07:52,370
No, not really.

86
00:07:52,437 --> 00:07:54,039
 Signs would've been nice, but.

87
00:07:54,105 --> 00:07:55,440
 - Yeah. Right.

88
00:07:55,507 --> 00:07:58,843
Well, we don't actually want
anyone else to find this place.

89
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,911
  So.

90
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:01,947
- Why? What's going on?

91
00:08:02,013 --> 00:08:03,815
- Well,

92
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:05,383
  I'm gonna show you.

93
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,218
 - Why all the secrecy?

94
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:08,920
 - You'll see.

95
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:10,789
- Oh my.

96
00:08:10,855 --> 00:08:12,023
Is that?

97
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,358
   - Come on.

98
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,328
   Careful going down though.

99
00:08:16,394 --> 00:08:19,164
   This first step, a
   little difficult.

100
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:25,370
   (light apprehensive music)

101
00:08:36,781 --> 00:08:39,484
- This can't be.

102
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:41,086
  - Pretty great, huh?

103
00:08:41,152 --> 00:08:42,487
  - [Dr. Ben-David] Be
  careful. All of you.

104
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:44,756
There may be more traps.

105
00:08:53,832 --> 00:08:55,100
  - Is that who I think it is?

106
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,801
   - Mm-hmm.

107
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:13,818
 - Axel, help me with the door.

108
00:09:16,154 --> 00:09:17,822
  - Look out!

109
00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:22,260
   - Carter.

110
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:45,083
   It is safe. Just,

111
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,317
Axel, get some lights in there.

112
00:09:46,384 --> 00:09:47,852
 Do not touch anything.

113
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,522
 Once we get some
 lights, we begin work.

114
00:09:50,588 --> 00:09:51,823
  - Professor.

115
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,125
   Professor, I'd like to
   introduce you to someone,

116
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:55,360
   Mrs. Molly Kirnan.

117
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:56,995
   Remember, the grad
   student I told you about?

118
00:09:57,062 --> 00:09:58,263
Molly, this is,

119
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:00,832
   - Professor Ari Ben-David
   of Cairo University.

120
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,034
  I am a great admirer
  of your epigraphy

121
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:05,103
  of the sacara in Necropolis.

122
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,472
  - Kara, we need the CCS let
  out by the end of the day.

123
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:08,673
- [Kara] Not a problem.

124
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,443
- Molly is a historical
linguistics specialist.

125
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:13,445
Her work in
pre-dynastic phonograms

126
00:10:13,511 --> 00:10:15,447
is pretty remarkable, actually.

127
00:10:15,513 --> 00:10:18,850
   - Ah, so what do you think
   of our little discovery.

128
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:21,386
  - It can't be real.

129
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:24,422
  - Preliminary electrocarbon
  analysis dates this site

130
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:27,459
  at 2654 BCE.

131
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:29,461
 - What is a Third
 Dynasty burial chamber

132
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:31,463
 doing in southern California?

133
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:32,530
 - Well, 10 years ago,

134
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:34,599
 Balabanova discovered
 arithrozylin coca

135
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,035
 and nicotiana tobacum
 in the hair shafts

136
00:10:37,102 --> 00:10:38,536
  of ancient Egyptian mummies.

137
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:39,904
   - Yeah, nicotine, cocaine.

138
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:42,107
   - Plants that only existed
   in the western hemisphere

139
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:44,142
during the age of the pharaohs.

140
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:45,543
- And Professor
Ben-David's long theory

141
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,245
 is that the Egyptians
 must have formed

142
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:49,981
  some kind of
  trans-Atlantic trade route.

143
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:51,449
- And now I believe my theories

144
00:10:51,516 --> 00:10:52,750
 have been proven fact.

145
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:56,287
 There are far too many
 similarities between Egyptian

146
00:10:56,354 --> 00:11:00,158
 and Inca step pyramids for it
 just to be mere coincidence.

147
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:01,626
 - [Axel] Ready doctor.

148
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:04,162
  - Ah. Please, come.

149
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:10,201
Everybody. Come.

150
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:23,047
(light intriguing music)

151
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,128
 When I discovered the Mustavas

152
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:39,397
  at Tamadosan Sacara,

153
00:11:39,464 --> 00:11:41,633
I discovered an execration text

154
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:43,968
that described a young priestess

155
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:45,570
  banished from Egypt

156
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:48,907
  because she claimed
  to be a living god.

157
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:51,075
   The name of that priestess

158
00:11:51,142 --> 00:11:53,545
  is the same as the
  one that is in here,

159
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:55,079
   Aneh-Tet.

160
00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:01,186
Aneh-Tet was a priestess of Zet,

161
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:05,390
   the god of chaos and evil.

162
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:08,259
  Zet members believed
  they would be given

163
00:12:08,326 --> 00:12:11,362
the great power to cast spells,

164
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:13,698
   to raise the dead,

165
00:12:13,765 --> 00:12:16,267
 and to be given eternal life.

166
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:19,037
 But Aneh-Tet's powers
 threatened Josier,

167
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:21,940
the ruling pharaoh at the time,

168
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:24,676
   and so he had her banished

169
00:12:24,742 --> 00:12:28,980
across the great water.

170
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:32,350
Egyptologists assumed
this meant the Red Sea.

171
00:12:35,053 --> 00:12:38,957
It appears the truth
written on these walls.

172
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:42,360
   It is a mystery that will
   take much to unravel.

173
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:46,264
I see symbols predate
heiroglyphs that we know

174
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:48,666
by 2,000 years.

175
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:52,503
  So,

176
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,606
   let's have a look
   at her, shall we?

177
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:58,343
(suspenseful drum music)

178
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,469
   - How did she die?

179
00:13:24,535 --> 00:13:26,571
- The Egyptians believed
that when they passed

180
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:29,240
   to the underworld,

181
00:13:29,307 --> 00:13:32,677
  they would become
  powerful and mighty,

182
00:13:32,744 --> 00:13:35,713
   and Aneh-Tet had
   herself mummified,

183
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,683
so that when she is resurrected,

184
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,553
she will return as a living god.

185
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,555
  - What happens then?

186
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:49,060
- It says here,

187
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:52,730
   that the ka or the spirit

188
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:55,333
  of Aneh-Tet

189
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,103
   shall return to
   her rightful place

190
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,073
as the pharaoh of Egypt.

191
00:14:03,474 --> 00:14:04,776
  - Excuse me, but I,

192
00:14:04,842 --> 00:14:07,712
   I think that this actually
   says that she who's name

193
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:10,048
 brings terror,

194
00:14:10,114 --> 00:14:13,151
   shall rise up from
   the underworld,

195
00:14:13,217 --> 00:14:17,488
   and bring forth those who
   will destroy her enemies,

196
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:25,096
   and take her place
   as supreme ruler

197
00:14:25,463 --> 00:14:28,166
of both the living and the dead.

198
00:14:28,232 --> 00:14:31,302
  - Yes. Well,

199
00:14:31,369 --> 00:14:34,238
  what say we all
  take a quick lunch.

200
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:36,708
We have much work to do.

201
00:14:44,248 --> 00:14:46,050
  It is Molly, right?

202
00:14:49,854 --> 00:14:53,424
  It is very important that
  nobody know about this site

203
00:14:53,491 --> 00:14:55,393
until we have finished our work.

204
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,694
   Do you understand?

205
00:14:56,761 --> 00:14:58,696
   - Yeah, of course.

206
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:01,833
 - If this turns out to
 be what I think it is,

207
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:06,104
it will be the
discovery of a lifetime.

208
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,173
- I understand.

209
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,844
  - Your skills will
  be very useful here.

210
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,645
 - I'll do what I can.

211
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,822
   - I don't care
   (unrecognizable) Imratep,

212
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:26,724
  not Imsatep.

213
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,359
- That's totally right.

214
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:29,193
 - No it's not.

215
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,328
   You read it totally wrong,

216
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:33,231
   'cause I was right
   there next to you.

217
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:41,639
- Come on, baby.

218
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:51,616
(light intriguing music)

219
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:11,836
 (reading wall)

220
00:16:11,903 --> 00:16:15,540
(intense music)

221
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:30,655
   - Oh shit. Bryan.

222
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:32,290
 - Good, Molly.

223
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:33,958
Now we can talk about el-Amarna.

224
00:16:34,025 --> 00:16:35,960
- There's nothing to talk about.

225
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:37,428
   - How could you say that?

226
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:38,596
 I mean, we were just,

227
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:40,832
  - Professor Edwards.

228
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:42,633
 - What is it, Carter?

229
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,902
   - How do I get
   back to the motel?

230
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:46,871
   - What happened to Santos?

231
00:16:46,938 --> 00:16:47,905
   - I heard he left.

232
00:16:47,972 --> 00:16:48,739
   Everybody's gone.

233
00:16:48,806 --> 00:16:51,309
  - Ah, shit.

234
00:16:53,744 --> 00:16:56,347
   Carter, you can
   take Molly, okay?

235
00:16:56,414 --> 00:16:57,081
   - Well no.

236
00:16:57,148 --> 00:16:58,716
I don't wanna, I wanna.

237
00:16:58,783 --> 00:16:59,550
  - It's fine.

238
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:00,618
  You have to check in anyway,

239
00:17:00,685 --> 00:17:02,320
   and Carter knows
   how to get there.

240
00:17:02,386 --> 00:17:05,389
Problem solved.

241
00:17:05,456 --> 00:17:07,492
   It's fine.

242
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:09,327
- Okay.

243
00:17:10,628 --> 00:17:14,499
(light rock music with singing)

244
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:17,502
 Is this the right way?

245
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:27,712
  Is this how it's
  gonna be between us?

246
00:17:27,778 --> 00:17:30,748
 - What did you expect?

247
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:34,919
- I thought we could be friends.

248
00:17:34,986 --> 00:17:39,023
Carter, we weren't even dating.

249
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,859
- You know how I felt about you.

250
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:43,861
   And I thought you
   felt the same way.

251
00:17:43,928 --> 00:17:44,929
- I did.

252
00:17:44,996 --> 00:17:46,631
  - Then why?

253
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:52,737
  - It was a mistake.

254
00:17:52,803 --> 00:17:54,705
  His wife had just left him.

255
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:58,276
 He reached out to me.

256
00:17:58,342 --> 00:18:01,679
  I was drunk.

257
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:03,948
  Haven't you ever
  slept with somebody

258
00:18:04,015 --> 00:18:05,883
 and then regretted it?

259
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:11,322
  - Hope you got a
  good grade at least.

260
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:17,428
   - Fuck you Carter.

261
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:24,735
 Home.

262
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:28,973
   (light jazzy rocky music)
   (phone ringing)

263
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,041
 - Yo.

264
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:31,676
  - [Molly] Hey Kev, it's me.

265
00:18:31,742 --> 00:18:32,610
 Is mom there?

266
00:18:32,677 --> 00:18:33,344
 - No.

267
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:35,479
She's working a double.

268
00:18:35,546 --> 00:18:36,747
 Where are you?

269
00:18:36,814 --> 00:18:38,849
- I'm headed to a hotel.

270
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,619
 - Are you with a guy?

271
00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:43,487
- I'm on a dig.

272
00:18:43,554 --> 00:18:44,822
- [Kevyn] Yawn.

273
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:46,657
   - Listen, I didn't think
   it was gonna be anything,

274
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:48,559
 so I didn't bring any clothes,

275
00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:50,728
and I was gonna ask mom
to bring a bag tomorrow,

276
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:51,562
  but if she's

277
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:52,396
 - I'll do it.

278
00:18:52,463 --> 00:18:53,464
  - [Molly] What about school?

279
00:18:53,531 --> 00:18:54,532
   - Do you want your
   clothes or not?

280
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:56,867
  - [Molly] Yeah.
  Yeah, okay. Alright.

281
00:18:56,934 --> 00:18:59,370
   - Cool. Where am I going?

282
00:19:01,672 --> 00:19:03,274
  - Is that...

283
00:19:23,594 --> 00:19:27,565
- Alright, got a pen and paper?

284
00:19:27,632 --> 00:19:29,767
  Okay, it's the Tropic Motel.

285
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:36,407
It's at 49001 Route 72.

286
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:39,777
- I'll see you at noon.

287
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:41,879
   - [Molly] I wanna
   be on site at six.

288
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:43,514
  - Dream on.

289
00:19:43,581 --> 00:19:45,016
 - [Molly] Okay, eight.

290
00:19:45,082 --> 00:19:47,918
  - Cool. I'll see you at 10.

291
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:04,101
   (foreboding music)

292
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:17,481
   (crickets)

293
00:20:27,992 --> 00:20:32,596
  (apprehensive music)

294
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:58,422
 (reading wall)

295
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:18,843
   (thunder)

296
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:23,581
(strange deep whispering voices)

297
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:49,840
  (intense apprehensive music)

298
00:21:49,907 --> 00:21:51,275
   - What are you doing here?

299
00:21:51,342 --> 00:21:53,711
  Who are you?

300
00:21:53,778 --> 00:21:55,913
 - I'm one of Professor
 Swartek's students.

301
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,782
 I was just, I was
 making a translation.

302
00:21:57,848 --> 00:21:59,116
 - Not now, you aren't.

303
00:21:59,183 --> 00:22:02,052
   No one is supposed to be
   in the tomb unsupervised.

304
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,888
  - But, they didn't.

305
00:22:03,954 --> 00:22:07,725
  - Don't you know there was
  a death here five days ago?

306
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:08,893
- No, I didn't.

307
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:10,561
 - I think we need to
 talk to the professor.

308
00:22:10,628 --> 00:22:12,129
  - No, that's not necessary.

309
00:22:12,196 --> 00:22:13,230
I'll just go back to the hotel.

310
00:22:13,297 --> 00:22:15,166
 - You don't wanna see
 Professor Swartek?

311
00:22:15,232 --> 00:22:17,201
I thought you were his student.

312
00:22:17,268 --> 00:22:18,569
  - It's complicated.

313
00:22:18,636 --> 00:22:20,805
   - Come on.

314
00:22:40,891 --> 00:22:41,992
- Molly.

315
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:43,093
- [Dennis] I found her
in the tomb, professor.

316
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,862
   She said she was a
   student of yours.

317
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:47,198
  - She is. It's fine, Dennis.

318
00:22:47,264 --> 00:22:48,332
- [Dennis] You said that
no one goes in the tomb

319
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:50,167
without yours or Dr.
Ben-David's permission.

320
00:22:50,234 --> 00:22:51,535
  - And that's right.

321
00:22:51,602 --> 00:22:52,837
   That's right. That's fine,
   but I'll take care of it.

322
00:22:52,903 --> 00:22:54,638
   Thank you.

323
00:22:55,706 --> 00:22:57,942
Thanks.

324
00:22:58,008 --> 00:23:00,177
 Well,

325
00:23:00,244 --> 00:23:01,779
 this is good.

326
00:23:01,846 --> 00:23:03,214
   Now we can finish
   our conversation.

327
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,150
 Bryan, don't.

328
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:07,418
  - What's the matter?

329
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:09,086
   You didn't have a problem
   with it last summer?

330
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:11,722
  - Last summer was a mistake.

331
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:16,794
  - Oh, I see.

332
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:21,699
 - No, that's not what I mean.

333
00:23:21,765 --> 00:23:23,067
  I was drunk.

334
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:25,636
  - So that means you don't
  have to take responsibility

335
00:23:25,703 --> 00:23:26,804
   for what happened?

336
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:27,738
  Is that what you're saying?

337
00:23:27,805 --> 00:23:30,074
- No, that's not
what I'm saying.

338
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,109
   Please don't be this way.

339
00:23:33,944 --> 00:23:34,945
 Listen, Bryan.

340
00:23:35,012 --> 00:23:36,113
 I respect you so much,

341
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,414
and you've done so much for me,

342
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:41,185
but I just want our relationship
to stay professional.

343
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:42,653
  That's all.

344
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,355
- Fine.

345
00:23:44,421 --> 00:23:47,191
   - I really want
   us to be friends.

346
00:23:47,258 --> 00:23:49,126
  - Good night Molly.

347
00:23:54,865 --> 00:23:55,866
 - I'm gonna be a
 little late tomorrow.

348
00:23:55,933 --> 00:23:58,035
  My sister's bringing
  me some clothes.

349
00:23:58,102 --> 00:23:59,336
   - Look, obviously
   you're gonna do

350
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:00,905
what you wanna do. Okay?

351
00:24:00,971 --> 00:24:02,373
 So just do it.

352
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:04,341
 Just try and get back
 here when you can.

353
00:24:04,408 --> 00:24:07,044
 Aneh-Tet's not going anywhere.

354
00:24:32,036 --> 00:24:33,070
- Kara.

355
00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:34,805
Hey, it's Bryan Swartek.

356
00:24:34,872 --> 00:24:36,340
  How are you?

357
00:24:36,407 --> 00:24:37,541
  Good, good.

358
00:24:37,608 --> 00:24:38,876
I was just wondering if
maybe you could come up

359
00:24:38,943 --> 00:24:43,914
  to the site tonight and
  help me finish the typology

360
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:45,916
   for the artifacts.

361
00:24:48,886 --> 00:24:50,154
Why not?

362
00:24:59,763 --> 00:25:03,901
   (apprehensive wind sound)

363
00:25:18,015 --> 00:25:20,818
   (thunder)

364
00:25:20,884 --> 00:25:24,121
(sparks)

365
00:25:29,226 --> 00:25:32,429
   (thunder)

366
00:25:49,847 --> 00:25:53,884
  (apprehensive music)

367
00:26:16,206 --> 00:26:20,144
   (intense rumblings
   and wind sound)

368
00:27:11,095 --> 00:27:12,763
 - Who's there?

369
00:27:15,032 --> 00:27:16,800
 You're naked.

370
00:27:20,938 --> 00:27:24,007
   (groaning)

371
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:38,122
 (string music)

372
00:27:44,561 --> 00:27:46,897
  - Kara, is that you?

373
00:27:57,441 --> 00:28:00,210
  (screaming)

374
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:24,101
 (intense wind)

375
00:28:31,975 --> 00:28:33,911
   - I'll go wake
   Professor Swartek.

376
00:28:33,977 --> 00:28:36,313
- Oh, is that what you call it?

377
00:28:40,984 --> 00:28:41,585
- Not cool, man.

378
00:28:41,652 --> 00:28:42,486
   Not cool.

379
00:28:42,553 --> 00:28:44,021
  - I mean...

380
00:28:47,324 --> 00:28:48,926
  - Professor?

381
00:28:58,468 --> 00:29:02,439
  (screaming)

382
00:29:18,622 --> 00:29:21,258
 - Where is my mummy?!

383
00:29:55,225 --> 00:29:56,994
- Piece of shit.

384
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,002
- Kevyn.

385
00:30:05,702 --> 00:30:08,572
- You so owe me.

386
00:30:14,611 --> 00:30:18,615
  (apprehensive music)

387
00:30:33,563 --> 00:30:36,166
   - Oh, I really appreciate
   you doing this Kev.

388
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:38,535
 - You could buy me some beer.

389
00:30:38,602 --> 00:30:40,570
 - I'm kidding.

390
00:30:41,872 --> 00:30:43,140
   - What's the wait?

391
00:30:43,206 --> 00:30:44,574
   I gotta get going.

392
00:30:44,641 --> 00:30:46,543
  - [Motel manager] Hey, you!

393
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,145
   Get out of there!

394
00:30:48,211 --> 00:30:49,279
 - What's that?

395
00:30:49,346 --> 00:30:51,214
- I don't know.

396
00:30:55,752 --> 00:30:58,155
- Come here. Come here.

397
00:30:59,756 --> 00:31:01,258
 - Is everything okay?

398
00:31:01,325 --> 00:31:03,627
 - Is she one of yours?

399
00:31:03,694 --> 00:31:05,629
 Well get some clothes on her.

400
00:31:05,696 --> 00:31:07,597
   This is a family business.

401
00:31:07,664 --> 00:31:09,266
 - Okay, okay.

402
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:10,634
 Here.

403
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,739
  Come with us, okay?

404
00:31:26,383 --> 00:31:28,452
   - [Molly] I'll get
   some more towels.

405
00:31:28,518 --> 00:31:29,653
- Okay.

406
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:34,424
My name's Kevyn.

407
00:31:34,491 --> 00:31:38,195
   Yeah, I know, I've already
   heard all the jokes.

408
00:31:39,396 --> 00:31:42,299
Kevyn. My name's Kevyn.

409
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:45,669
  - Aneh-Tet.

410
00:31:45,736 --> 00:31:49,573
- Annette? Your name's Annette?

411
00:31:53,343 --> 00:31:55,078
  Let's cover you up.

412
00:31:55,879 --> 00:31:57,114
 Here.

413
00:32:08,392 --> 00:32:10,360
  What are you doing?

414
00:32:18,335 --> 00:32:19,403
- How we doing?

415
00:32:19,469 --> 00:32:22,739
- Well, I found out that
her name is Annette.

416
00:32:22,806 --> 00:32:24,608
 And she's gay.

417
00:32:31,515 --> 00:32:33,116
   - Annette?

418
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:35,252
   (speaking French)

419
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,122
   (speaking Spanish)

420
00:32:43,326 --> 00:32:45,162
   (speaking Hebrew)

421
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:53,537
  (speaking unknown language)

422
00:32:57,541 --> 00:32:58,942
- What was that?

423
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:00,243
Did you understand that?

424
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,178
  (speaking unknown language)

425
00:33:07,717 --> 00:33:09,619
  - What did she say?!

426
00:33:11,488 --> 00:33:13,523
   - It's impossible.

427
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:16,293
- What?

428
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:17,961
   - She's speaking a
   language that's been dead

429
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:20,363
for 3,000 years.

430
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:38,081
  You guys stay here.

431
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:39,416
I'm gonna go find
Professor Swartek, okay?

432
00:33:39,483 --> 00:33:41,585
 - I'm calling Mom and telling
 her I'm staying with you

433
00:33:41,651 --> 00:33:43,553
for the weekend.

434
00:33:44,621 --> 00:33:46,289
Stay here, okay?

435
00:33:54,865 --> 00:33:56,833
  - Yeah, we won't be able to
  properly identify the bodies

436
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,269
 until we get some DNA testing.

437
00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:00,737
   - My god.

438
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:07,010
   - She's not one of yours?

439
00:34:07,077 --> 00:34:08,512
 - No.

440
00:34:11,781 --> 00:34:13,316
   - Excuse me, miss.

441
00:34:13,383 --> 00:34:16,653
   Miss. Miss, just
   stop right there.

442
00:34:18,388 --> 00:34:19,823
  Who are you?

443
00:34:21,525 --> 00:34:22,592
Did you hear me?

444
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:24,961
I asked you a question.

445
00:34:25,028 --> 00:34:27,564
You don't wanna listen, do you?

446
00:34:27,631 --> 00:34:31,835
 (rumblings, wind,
 unrecognizable voices)

447
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:45,475
- What's wrong?

448
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:48,678
  - Professor Swartek is dead.

449
00:35:48,745 --> 00:35:51,982
  - Oh my god, no way.

450
00:35:52,048 --> 00:35:55,685
  - I just saw him last night.

451
00:35:55,752 --> 00:35:56,886
 - It was bad.

452
00:35:56,953 --> 00:35:58,088
 - What are you talking about?

453
00:35:58,154 --> 00:36:00,590
 What happened?

454
00:36:00,657 --> 00:36:02,926
   - I've gotta go find out.

455
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:11,434
   Stay here.

456
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:28,551
 - Wow.

457
00:36:28,618 --> 00:36:31,054
 - I told you to wait outside.

458
00:36:31,121 --> 00:36:32,922
   - Please.

459
00:36:40,063 --> 00:36:42,565
   - Dr. Ben-David? Annette?

460
00:36:42,632 --> 00:36:45,535
- Molly.

461
00:36:45,602 --> 00:36:48,071
   - What's going on?

462
00:36:48,138 --> 00:36:50,874
   - I see that you have met

463
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,778
my assistant from Cairo.

464
00:36:54,844 --> 00:36:56,513
   - Your assistant?

465
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:57,881
 - Yes.

466
00:36:57,947 --> 00:37:02,385
 I believe she can be very
 helpful with the translations.

467
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:06,056
  Why? What were you thinking?

468
00:37:09,025 --> 00:37:11,194
 That Aneh-Tet,

469
00:37:11,261 --> 00:37:13,563
   High Priestess of Setekh,

470
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,498
had risen from the dead?

471
00:37:15,565 --> 00:37:17,901
(laughs)

472
00:37:17,967 --> 00:37:20,570
  - No, of course not.

473
00:37:20,637 --> 00:37:22,138
   It's not possible.

474
00:37:22,205 --> 00:37:24,541
 - No, it isn't, is it?

475
00:37:28,812 --> 00:37:30,847
 - North wall.

476
00:37:30,914 --> 00:37:32,849
  Grids seven, eight, and nine

477
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:35,518
  depict the life symbol ankh,

478
00:37:35,585 --> 00:37:37,721
   surrounded by six
   warrior figures,

479
00:37:37,787 --> 00:37:40,457
  and six upside down figures,

480
00:37:40,523 --> 00:37:44,561
  unattested in any
  known translations.

481
00:37:44,627 --> 00:37:47,130
   The six warriors
   probably represent

482
00:37:47,197 --> 00:37:49,899
   the six mummies
   found in the tomb,

483
00:37:49,966 --> 00:37:53,636
 but I don't understand
 the other figures.

484
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:56,973
  They could be
  representations of something

485
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,075
they'll become.

486
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:03,880
Something more powerful.

487
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:11,488
 (playing and laughing)

488
00:38:11,554 --> 00:38:15,592
  (rap music)

489
00:38:27,937 --> 00:38:30,039
(laughs)

490
00:38:30,106 --> 00:38:32,208
  - You're drinking this time.

491
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:33,810
  - I told you, I don't drink.

492
00:38:33,877 --> 00:38:36,646
  - Oh, shut up. Do it again.

493
00:38:37,814 --> 00:38:39,883
 - Oh!

494
00:38:39,949 --> 00:38:41,851
 - Don't mess with the reflex.

495
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:43,520
 - Drink dude!

496
00:38:44,821 --> 00:38:46,089
- Kevyn!

497
00:38:46,156 --> 00:38:47,157
- Molly.

498
00:38:47,223 --> 00:38:48,958
 - What are you doing?

499
00:38:49,025 --> 00:38:51,294
   - Do you know what
   this guy can do?

500
00:38:51,361 --> 00:38:54,764
Show my sister what you can do.

501
00:38:54,831 --> 00:38:57,567
  - I don't think
  she'll be impressed.

502
00:38:57,634 --> 00:39:01,204
 - Hey, come back here!

503
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:02,872
 - Hey, you know what?

504
00:39:02,939 --> 00:39:04,741
   I think you've had enough?

505
00:39:04,808 --> 00:39:07,310
 - Your sister was cool, Molly.

506
00:39:07,377 --> 00:39:09,045
  - She's 17.

507
00:39:11,981 --> 00:39:13,716
 Give me that.

508
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:17,587
  - Head rush.

509
00:39:17,654 --> 00:39:18,755
  - Alright, come on.

510
00:39:18,822 --> 00:39:21,090
   Let's get you to the room.

511
00:39:26,062 --> 00:39:28,698
 - Hey Axe, we're
 going to bed too man.

512
00:39:28,765 --> 00:39:30,033
  - You okay?

513
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:31,968
   - Oh yeah, as long as the
   bill holds out, I'm all,

514
00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:33,636
   "Y'all have fun!"

515
00:39:33,703 --> 00:39:35,171
  - We will, we will.

516
00:39:35,238 --> 00:39:37,106
 - Go have fun.

517
00:40:01,164 --> 00:40:02,866
- Howdy.

518
00:40:02,932 --> 00:40:06,603
   You Dr. Ben-David?

519
00:40:06,669 --> 00:40:08,104
 - Yes.

520
00:40:08,171 --> 00:40:09,606
   - I'm J.L. Jones.

521
00:40:09,672 --> 00:40:11,741
  I'm the county
  sheriff around here.

522
00:40:11,808 --> 00:40:15,945
You wouldn't happen to
know where my deputy is?

523
00:40:16,012 --> 00:40:18,815
  - No, he left us hours ago.

524
00:40:18,882 --> 00:40:21,117
  Why?

525
00:40:21,184 --> 00:40:22,886
- He hasn't checked in.

526
00:40:22,952 --> 00:40:24,921
   I found his car abandoned
   at the county line

527
00:40:24,988 --> 00:40:26,823
  20 miles from here.

528
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,892
   - I'm sorry to hear that.

529
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:31,027
- He didn't happen to
say where he was going,

530
00:40:31,094 --> 00:40:32,896
did he?

531
00:40:32,962 --> 00:40:35,298
- No sheriff. I'm sorry.

532
00:40:37,433 --> 00:40:40,837
  - It's okay, I'm just
  trying to retrace his steps.

533
00:40:40,904 --> 00:40:44,007
   You'll call if you or your
   students hear anything.

534
00:40:44,073 --> 00:40:45,975
  - Of course.

535
00:40:48,711 --> 00:40:51,180
 - Oh.

536
00:40:51,247 --> 00:40:53,182
  That original call.

537
00:40:53,249 --> 00:40:56,219
  Something to do with
  a missing person,

538
00:40:56,286 --> 00:41:01,124
  or a stolen mummy
  or something, right?

539
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,725
 - Yes.

540
00:41:04,327 --> 00:41:06,296
But everything is all right now.

541
00:41:06,362 --> 00:41:08,331
   We have found her.

542
00:41:08,398 --> 00:41:10,733
 - Good, good.

543
00:41:13,369 --> 00:41:15,104
 Good evening.

544
00:41:28,117 --> 00:41:30,253
   - Finish that water, Kev.

545
00:41:42,465 --> 00:41:47,003
  - That Carter guy
  is in love with you.

546
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:49,172
   - I know.

547
00:41:49,238 --> 00:41:52,775
   - What's wrong? He's cute.

548
00:41:52,842 --> 00:41:54,777
  You both like boring stuff.

549
00:41:54,844 --> 00:41:56,879
 You're perfect for each other.

550
00:41:56,946 --> 00:41:58,815
- It's not gonna happen.

551
00:41:58,881 --> 00:42:01,017
   - Why not?

552
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:04,821
   - Because I did something
   that really hurt him.

553
00:42:04,887 --> 00:42:08,057
   - So. It's not like
   either one of you is dead.

554
00:42:08,124 --> 00:42:09,792
 If you care about him,

555
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:12,395
  like do something about it.

556
00:42:15,331 --> 00:42:18,267
  - And everyone says
  I'm the smart one.

557
00:42:18,334 --> 00:42:20,403
(laughs)

558
00:42:21,537 --> 00:42:22,739
- Jones.

559
00:42:22,805 --> 00:42:24,107
 - [Sam] Sheriff, Sam.

560
00:42:24,173 --> 00:42:25,808
   - What do you have for me?

561
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:29,412
 - Both victims died of
 massive dehydration.

562
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:32,348
  - Look, I admit I'm not the
  sharpest tool in the shed,

563
00:42:32,415 --> 00:42:35,151
   but I know those two guys
   didn't die of thirst.

564
00:42:35,218 --> 00:42:37,020
  - [Sam] Talking
  about 80% water loss

565
00:42:37,086 --> 00:42:40,757
  in less than what I
  count at one minute.

566
00:42:40,823 --> 00:42:42,792
- What could cause that?

567
00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:44,227
   - I have no idea,

568
00:42:44,293 --> 00:42:45,561
 but you haven't heard
 the best part yet.

569
00:42:45,628 --> 00:42:49,966
  I found foreign skin and
  hair samples on both bodies.

570
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:52,135
   - [Sheriff] So,
   we have a suspect?

571
00:42:52,201 --> 00:42:54,337
  - No, no, no. Not there yet.

572
00:42:54,404 --> 00:42:57,940
  Cannot figure a way a human
  being could have done this.

573
00:42:58,007 --> 00:43:00,910
  I've extracted DNA,
  analyzing it now.

574
00:43:00,977 --> 00:43:02,812
  - Well, I need answers, Sam.

575
00:43:02,879 --> 00:43:04,380
  - I'm doing what I can, Jim.

576
00:43:04,447 --> 00:43:06,215
  But this is two deaths now.

577
00:43:06,282 --> 00:43:08,317
   Isn't that enough
   to shut 'em down?

578
00:43:08,384 --> 00:43:10,887
   - I've been calling the
   governor's office all day,

579
00:43:10,953 --> 00:43:14,023
  but this character Ben-David
  seems to have some juice.

580
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,191
  I need more.

581
00:43:15,258 --> 00:43:17,994
 - [Sam] I'll call you
 when I have something.

582
00:43:18,061 --> 00:43:20,897
  - Let's hope that's
  just soon enough.

583
00:43:27,303 --> 00:43:28,504
   - Oh man.

584
00:43:28,571 --> 00:43:31,140
  I'm gonna get me something.

585
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:10,246
   Hey, wait for me!

586
00:44:16,452 --> 00:44:19,021
Yes. Thank you.

587
00:44:20,056 --> 00:44:22,892
 Hey, where'd you go?!

588
00:44:27,163 --> 00:44:29,165
  Shit, you scared me.

589
00:44:34,203 --> 00:44:35,404
 Stop.

590
00:44:40,009 --> 00:44:40,910
 Shit.

591
00:44:40,977 --> 00:44:42,345
   You like it rough.

592
00:44:42,411 --> 00:44:44,647
  That's cool.

593
00:44:44,714 --> 00:44:47,650
  Oh, hey baby.
  Let's take it slow.

594
00:44:47,717 --> 00:44:49,619
 Take it, yeah.

595
00:44:49,685 --> 00:44:52,388
(drums)

596
00:45:34,597 --> 00:45:36,332
- Ah, Molly. Good, you are here.

597
00:45:36,399 --> 00:45:38,201
  You can help me with
  these translations.

598
00:45:38,267 --> 00:45:39,535
  - No, I need to talk to you.

599
00:45:39,602 --> 00:45:41,571
 - About what?

600
00:45:41,637 --> 00:45:42,738
- Something isn't right.

601
00:45:42,805 --> 00:45:44,707
These heiroglyphics are
unlike anything anyone

602
00:45:44,774 --> 00:45:46,475
 has ever seen before.

603
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:48,010
  - That is because
  they are older texts

604
00:45:48,077 --> 00:45:50,613
   than anything we
   are familiar with.

605
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,381
  - But, it's more than that.

606
00:45:52,448 --> 00:45:54,717
 They're darker, more,

607
00:45:54,784 --> 00:45:57,019
   I don't know, aggressive.

608
00:45:57,086 --> 00:45:58,287
  See.

609
00:46:01,624 --> 00:46:04,527
   A priestess from the West

610
00:46:04,594 --> 00:46:08,397
 shall speak the
 coming forth into day

611
00:46:08,464 --> 00:46:12,034
   and shall awaken
   the Hemet Netsher.

612
00:46:12,101 --> 00:46:14,303
She who is all-powerful.

613
00:46:17,573 --> 00:46:19,575
  Ankh is never
  depicted like this.

614
00:46:19,642 --> 00:46:21,110
 It's the life symbol,

615
00:46:21,177 --> 00:46:22,645
but here it seems to me,

616
00:46:22,712 --> 00:46:24,747
  more like a weapon.

617
00:46:24,814 --> 00:46:27,617
 Most Egyptian funerary
 texts are about

618
00:46:27,683 --> 00:46:29,919
  rebirth and

619
00:46:30,686 --> 00:46:32,722
   democratization
   of the afterlife.

620
00:46:32,788 --> 00:46:36,425
   These all seem to be about
   conquest and destruction.

621
00:46:55,344 --> 00:46:58,014
 She will bring death and pain,

622
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,417
 destruction and fear.

623
00:47:01,484 --> 00:47:04,320
   World domination.

624
00:47:04,387 --> 00:47:06,522
   - Does it say how
   this will happen?

625
00:47:06,589 --> 00:47:09,358
- Well, I think,

626
00:47:09,425 --> 00:47:11,694
   I think that's over here.

627
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:28,377
- Get out of here Molly.

628
00:47:28,444 --> 00:47:29,211
  - What did she say?

629
00:47:29,278 --> 00:47:30,046
  Something about a priestess,

630
00:47:30,112 --> 00:47:31,247
  I couldn't quite understand.

631
00:47:31,314 --> 00:47:33,282
- I told you not to tell
anyone about this site.

632
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:34,617
  I do not want you back here.

633
00:47:34,684 --> 00:47:35,284
 - But I need to know.

634
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:37,420
   - I said get out!

635
00:47:37,486 --> 00:47:41,457
  (apprehensive music)

636
00:48:03,646 --> 00:48:07,516
- Carter, I need to talk to you.

637
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:09,352
 - I'm a little busy right now.

638
00:48:09,418 --> 00:48:10,786
 - This isn't about us.

639
00:48:10,853 --> 00:48:13,089
   I need your help.

640
00:48:13,155 --> 00:48:14,824
  It's about Annette.

641
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:16,525
- Ben-David's assistant.

642
00:48:16,592 --> 00:48:18,227
   - She's not his assistant.

643
00:48:18,294 --> 00:48:20,363
   She doesn't speak
   Hebrew or Arabic.

644
00:48:20,429 --> 00:48:22,398
- What do you think she,

645
00:48:22,465 --> 00:48:24,266
come on.

646
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:26,535
  - The mummy of
  Aneh-Tet disappears

647
00:48:26,602 --> 00:48:29,805
 and some girl shows up
 speaking Old Kingdom Egyptian.

648
00:48:29,872 --> 00:48:32,241
   Nothing else makes sense.

649
00:48:32,308 --> 00:48:33,309
   She's planning something.

650
00:48:33,376 --> 00:48:34,443
   I don't know what,

651
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:35,745
  but the answer is in
  those heiroglyphics.

652
00:48:35,811 --> 00:48:37,046
   I can translate the text,

653
00:48:37,113 --> 00:48:39,382
   but I can't interpret the
   religious significance.

654
00:48:39,448 --> 00:48:41,083
  I need you.

655
00:48:43,753 --> 00:48:44,620
  - I can't help you.

656
00:48:44,687 --> 00:48:48,190
   - Carter.

657
00:48:48,257 --> 00:48:49,859
I don't know how many
times I could apologize

658
00:48:49,925 --> 00:48:53,429
 for what I did to you.

659
00:48:53,496 --> 00:48:55,464
   - How about once?

660
00:49:07,443 --> 00:49:09,078
- Housekeeping.

661
00:49:10,379 --> 00:49:12,348
   - Come back later!

662
00:49:56,725 --> 00:49:58,594
   (screams)

663
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:09,338
(birds chirping)

664
00:50:19,381 --> 00:50:23,619
  (apprehensive music)

665
00:50:38,367 --> 00:50:41,337
   (thunder)

666
00:50:55,017 --> 00:50:56,652
- What the fuck?

667
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:57,887
   Oh my god!

668
00:50:57,953 --> 00:50:59,755
  (screaming)

669
00:51:25,881 --> 00:51:27,583
 - Need a break, babe?

670
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:28,884
   - I'm gonna run
   back to the motel,

671
00:51:28,951 --> 00:51:29,952
 check on Axe,

672
00:51:30,019 --> 00:51:31,754
 make sure he didn't pass out,

673
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,789
  drown in his own
  vomit or something.

674
00:51:33,856 --> 00:51:34,623
- Nice.

675
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:35,824
- See you later?

676
00:51:35,891 --> 00:51:37,893
  - Hell yeah.

677
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:38,694
 - Bye.

678
00:51:38,761 --> 00:51:40,462
 - Bye.

679
00:51:43,933 --> 00:51:47,336
  (suspenseful music)

680
00:51:47,403 --> 00:51:51,373
   (banging)

681
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,517
  - Professor?

682
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:05,654
   Professor?

683
00:52:05,721 --> 00:52:07,489
   - Kara, I.

684
00:52:07,556 --> 00:52:11,427
 - I don't understand.

685
00:52:11,493 --> 00:52:15,798
 - You should not have
 come in here Kara.

686
00:52:15,864 --> 00:52:18,767
 - Professor. I

687
00:52:19,768 --> 00:52:22,605
  (screaming)

688
00:52:22,671 --> 00:52:25,841
 - No! No! No!

689
00:52:30,779 --> 00:52:33,682
   - I'm sorry Kara.

690
00:52:33,749 --> 00:52:35,784
  (screaming)

691
00:52:49,465 --> 00:52:50,866
   (screams)

692
00:52:51,533 --> 00:52:53,035
 - Shit Molly!

693
00:52:53,102 --> 00:52:54,436
- Are you okay?

694
00:52:54,503 --> 00:52:55,938
- You scared the shit out of me!

695
00:52:56,005 --> 00:52:58,874
   - God, I'm sorry.

696
00:52:58,941 --> 00:53:01,777
 Here, I brought you ice cream.

697
00:53:01,844 --> 00:53:03,679
   - All is forgiven.

698
00:53:07,082 --> 00:53:09,418
 - So, how do you feel?

699
00:53:09,485 --> 00:53:11,153
  - I'm never drinking again.

700
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,422
- Good.

701
00:53:13,489 --> 00:53:15,991
   Kev, I need you
   to do me a favor.

702
00:53:16,058 --> 00:53:17,092
- What?

703
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:19,128
- I want you to go home.

704
00:53:19,194 --> 00:53:20,129
 - Why?

705
00:53:20,195 --> 00:53:23,499
 - It's too complicated
 to explain.

706
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,171
  - It's mummy chick isn't it?

707
00:53:29,238 --> 00:53:31,073
   - What makes you say that?

708
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,108
- I don't have to be a
nerd to figure out that.

709
00:53:33,175 --> 00:53:34,576
   Bitch is bad news.

710
00:53:34,643 --> 00:53:35,911
   - Oh, Kev. Please.

711
00:53:35,978 --> 00:53:37,613
  Just do me this favor, okay?

712
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,847
 - No, I can help you.

713
00:53:38,914 --> 00:53:40,149
   - No, you cannot help me.

714
00:53:40,215 --> 00:53:41,750
- How do you know that?

715
00:53:41,817 --> 00:53:43,585
  You think you've
  got all the answers

716
00:53:43,652 --> 00:53:46,121
  just because you're
  Miss Cumma Sum Laude

717
00:53:46,188 --> 00:53:48,157
   - Summa cum laude.

718
00:53:48,223 --> 00:53:49,491
  - Whatever.

719
00:53:49,558 --> 00:53:52,027
  You never think about things
  until after you do them.

720
00:53:52,094 --> 00:53:55,464
 Like coming to the desert
 without bringing any clothes.

721
00:53:55,531 --> 00:53:56,732
  - I'm not discussing
  this anymore.

722
00:53:56,799 --> 00:53:58,067
   I want you to get dressed.

723
00:53:58,133 --> 00:53:59,601
   I want you to get
   out of here, okay?

724
00:53:59,668 --> 00:54:00,736
 - Where are you going?

725
00:54:00,803 --> 00:54:01,970
  I wanna go with you.

726
00:54:02,037 --> 00:54:04,506
 - Kev, please!

727
00:54:04,573 --> 00:54:08,010
I don't want anything
to happen to you, okay?

728
00:54:08,077 --> 00:54:10,012
  Just please go home.

729
00:54:13,949 --> 00:54:17,686
   - I'm not going anywhere.

730
00:55:39,201 --> 00:55:41,703
 - I'm such an asshole.

731
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:54,550
  What are you doing?

732
00:55:59,755 --> 00:56:01,657
Oh my god, stop.

733
00:56:22,344 --> 00:56:23,912
   (screams)

734
00:56:26,148 --> 00:56:29,952
  (suspenseful drums)

735
00:56:38,393 --> 00:56:42,965
  (speaking ancient language)

736
00:56:57,212 --> 00:57:01,083
  (suspenseful drums)

737
00:57:01,917 --> 00:57:03,819
  - Carter, oh my god.

738
00:57:06,121 --> 00:57:07,389
  Carter, what's going
  on? You're hurt.

739
00:57:07,456 --> 00:57:08,957
 - Just drive.

740
00:57:09,024 --> 00:57:10,325
 Drive!

741
00:57:24,273 --> 00:57:25,240
 - I gotta take a shit.

742
00:57:25,307 --> 00:57:27,409
  I need some fucking
  toilet paper.

743
00:57:27,476 --> 00:57:29,177
   - Hey, you just get back?

744
00:57:29,244 --> 00:57:30,646
  - Yeah, just like
  a half an hour ago.

745
00:57:30,712 --> 00:57:31,947
   - Did Kara come with you?

746
00:57:32,014 --> 00:57:33,081
   - Na, I haven't seen her.

747
00:57:33,148 --> 00:57:34,283
   Maybe she came with Jill.

748
00:57:34,349 --> 00:57:35,751
 - I already asked her.

749
00:57:35,817 --> 00:57:37,052
 Shit.

750
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,921
I better get out there.

751
00:57:42,758 --> 00:57:45,427
   - What the fuck?!

752
00:57:45,494 --> 00:57:48,297
  - I have a first
  aid kit in my room.

753
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:52,301
  - Sit down.

754
00:57:52,367 --> 00:57:53,702
   Where's your kit?

755
00:57:53,769 --> 00:57:55,904
   - In my bag, the dresser.

756
00:57:55,971 --> 00:57:58,307
 - Take off your shirt.

757
00:58:02,411 --> 00:58:04,012
We should get you to a hospital.

758
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:05,280
 - We don't have time.

759
00:58:05,347 --> 00:58:06,348
   - Why not?

760
00:58:06,415 --> 00:58:09,685
   - Because we have
   to stop Aneh-Tet.

761
00:58:11,253 --> 00:58:13,422
 - Did she say anything
 when she attacked you?

762
00:58:13,488 --> 00:58:18,093
 - She said (ancient language)

763
00:58:20,395 --> 00:58:22,264
- Are you sure?

764
00:58:22,331 --> 00:58:24,399
  - Positive.

765
00:58:24,466 --> 00:58:29,204
- Why would she say six?

766
00:58:29,271 --> 00:58:31,306
   Oh my god!

767
00:58:31,373 --> 00:58:33,842
I am so stupid!

768
00:58:33,909 --> 00:58:36,712
   Of course!

769
00:58:36,778 --> 00:58:39,448
In the tomb, there's a
picture of six warriors

770
00:58:39,514 --> 00:58:41,883
 and six shadow figures
 surrounding an ankh.

771
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:44,152
   - I saw it, the
   ankh. She has it.

772
00:58:44,219 --> 00:58:46,755
   - Professor Swartek, Axel,

773
00:58:46,822 --> 00:58:48,023
 somebody we don't know about,

774
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:50,125
  the deputy, security guard,

775
00:58:50,192 --> 00:58:51,426
   you were supposed
   to be the sixth.

776
00:58:51,493 --> 00:58:52,995
 - Sixth what?

777
00:58:53,061 --> 00:58:54,830
  - Offering.

778
00:58:54,896 --> 00:58:58,266
 - What's significance of six?

779
00:58:58,333 --> 00:58:59,301
   Of course.

780
00:58:59,368 --> 00:59:01,937
She needs a victim's ka.

781
00:59:02,004 --> 00:59:05,273
- We have to stop her
before she gets a sixth.

782
00:59:05,841 --> 00:59:07,976
(phone ringing)

783
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,315
 - What do you got for me, Sam?

784
00:59:13,382 --> 00:59:16,852
- I've got the
preliminary DNA results.

785
00:59:16,918 --> 00:59:18,387
  - It's Ben-David, isn't it?

786
00:59:18,453 --> 00:59:20,022
  - I don't think so.

787
00:59:20,088 --> 00:59:22,257
Your suspect is female.

788
00:59:22,324 --> 00:59:23,825
- [Sheriff] One of the students?

789
00:59:23,892 --> 00:59:24,960
- Nope.

790
00:59:25,027 --> 00:59:29,698
 These DNA samples are
 over 4,000 years old.

791
00:59:37,539 --> 00:59:40,008
Sheriff?

792
00:59:40,075 --> 00:59:43,111
   - Never mind. Never mind.

793
00:59:48,417 --> 00:59:52,721
 (light drum and string music)

794
01:00:06,601 --> 01:00:08,937
- Kara!

795
01:00:13,975 --> 01:00:15,177
 Kara!

796
01:00:22,984 --> 01:00:25,053
  Professor Ben-David.

797
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:27,055
   Your hair.

798
01:00:27,122 --> 01:00:30,092
   - Sem priest must be pure
   if he wishes to serve

799
01:00:30,158 --> 01:00:31,593
   the Hemet Niswah.

800
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:34,496
  - What the fuck are
  you talking about?

801
01:00:38,133 --> 01:00:41,970
  (strong wind sound)

802
01:01:02,991 --> 01:01:04,392
  (screaming)

803
01:01:21,443 --> 01:01:25,313
   (rumbling)

804
01:01:56,611 --> 01:02:00,048
- Here, let me help you.

805
01:02:00,115 --> 01:02:02,050
Careful.

806
01:02:09,658 --> 01:02:12,160
 I think I know how we
 can stop her, okay?

807
01:02:12,227 --> 01:02:13,428
  I'll be right back.

808
01:02:13,495 --> 01:02:16,331
  - Hey Molly.

809
01:02:16,398 --> 01:02:18,366
  Thanks for the note.

810
01:02:36,151 --> 01:02:39,020
  (apprehensive music)

811
01:02:42,224 --> 01:02:45,227
  - Hey, what's
  going on out there?

812
01:02:45,293 --> 01:02:46,361
 Hey, hey, hey.

813
01:02:46,428 --> 01:02:48,630
  What are you doing?

814
01:03:02,811 --> 01:03:04,045
   - Carter!

815
01:03:04,112 --> 01:03:05,413
 - Molly. Are you okay?

816
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,482
  - Carter! Oh my god!

817
01:03:12,687 --> 01:03:14,055
   (screams)

818
01:03:18,627 --> 01:03:20,228
   - Molly, you okay?

819
01:03:20,295 --> 01:03:22,130
- They're in your room.

820
01:03:22,197 --> 01:03:25,166
   I'm not leaving
   without my sister.

821
01:03:27,402 --> 01:03:29,137
   (screams)

822
01:03:32,374 --> 01:03:35,944
  (deep unrecognizable voices)

823
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,762
 - [female TV actor]
 Un-fucking-believable,
 this is amazing.

824
01:03:53,828 --> 01:03:54,863
   - [male TV actor]
   What is it, Jen?

825
01:03:54,929 --> 01:03:55,597
 - [female TV actor]
 These are the tunnels

826
01:03:55,664 --> 01:03:58,433
that our dads went into.

827
01:04:00,168 --> 01:04:03,571
  (speaking unknown language)

828
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:06,741
- Kevyn, Kevyn.

829
01:04:06,808 --> 01:04:11,146
  (intense drums with strings)

830
01:04:17,852 --> 01:04:19,287
 Fuck!

831
01:04:26,294 --> 01:04:27,195
  (speaking unknown language)

832
01:04:27,262 --> 01:04:29,130
   - Carter!

833
01:04:55,423 --> 01:04:57,092
  - You okay?

834
01:04:57,158 --> 01:04:58,860
- We have to get Kevyn.

835
01:04:58,927 --> 01:05:00,495
   - We will.

836
01:05:00,562 --> 01:05:02,630
- We have to go to the tomb now.

837
01:05:02,697 --> 01:05:06,167
   - No, we need to figure
   out how to stop her first.

838
01:05:13,308 --> 01:05:16,444
   What does it say?

839
01:05:16,511 --> 01:05:17,746
   - Oh god. Kevyn was right.

840
01:05:17,812 --> 01:05:19,247
  It was right there in
  front of me the whole time,

841
01:05:19,314 --> 01:05:20,849
and I missed it.

842
01:05:20,915 --> 01:05:24,452
The dark ones will bring
destruction and chaos

843
01:05:24,519 --> 01:05:27,622
 on all mankind and place
 Aneh-Tet in her rightful place

844
01:05:27,689 --> 01:05:28,823
  as almighty.

845
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:31,559
   - Does it say the
   becoming will take place?

846
01:05:31,626 --> 01:05:34,829
How to stop her?

847
01:05:34,896 --> 01:05:38,366
- The ankh of life when
wedded with pure blood

848
01:05:38,433 --> 01:05:41,503
  will have the power of life
  or death over any being,

849
01:05:41,569 --> 01:05:43,338
   mortal or divine.

850
01:05:43,405 --> 01:05:44,806
  What does that mean?

851
01:05:44,873 --> 01:05:45,673
 - Oh.

852
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:48,309
- What?

853
01:05:48,376 --> 01:05:50,845
- She has to sacrifice a virgin.

854
01:05:51,546 --> 01:05:54,616
   (thunder)

855
01:05:54,682 --> 01:05:58,620
  (apprehensive music)

856
01:06:48,436 --> 01:06:50,738
  - Yeah, Sam.

857
01:06:50,805 --> 01:06:53,942
 I need you to meet me
 at the Tropic Motel.

858
01:06:54,008 --> 01:06:58,313
   (suspenseful string music)

859
01:07:08,323 --> 01:07:09,624
 - This is it.

860
01:07:13,895 --> 01:07:18,466
  (whimpering)

861
01:07:18,533 --> 01:07:20,635
 (deep voices)

862
01:07:27,075 --> 01:07:28,943
   - Leave me alone!

863
01:07:29,878 --> 01:07:33,715
  (speaking unknown language)

864
01:07:41,856 --> 01:07:43,324
- Stop!

865
01:07:47,896 --> 01:07:50,665
 (deep voices)

866
01:07:59,541 --> 01:08:00,441
  Let her go.

867
01:08:35,977 --> 01:08:38,246
 (deep voices)

868
01:08:54,162 --> 01:08:55,697
   - Kevyn, get out of here.

869
01:08:55,763 --> 01:08:56,731
- I'm staying with you.

870
01:08:56,798 --> 01:08:58,967
   - No, no. Get out
   of here please.

871
01:08:59,033 --> 01:09:00,735
 Go. Your car is right outside.

872
01:09:00,802 --> 01:09:01,936
 Call the police. Call anybody.

873
01:09:02,003 --> 01:09:03,004
  Go, please.

874
01:09:03,071 --> 01:09:05,073
  - You know I love you right?

875
01:09:05,139 --> 01:09:06,641
   - I know, I love you too.

876
01:09:06,708 --> 01:09:08,042
  Go!

877
01:09:27,495 --> 01:09:29,464
   (screams)

878
01:09:32,967 --> 01:09:35,837
  (speaking unknown language)

879
01:09:43,611 --> 01:09:45,813
 - [Carter] The
 mummies, they're gone.

880
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:46,814
- Kevyn!

881
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:48,516
 - Molly, stop.

882
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:52,353
 (deep voices)

883
01:10:53,214 --> 01:10:56,050
- Just hear me out, Sam.

884
01:10:56,117 --> 01:10:57,952
   An ancient tomb is opened,

885
01:10:58,019 --> 01:11:02,190
  and people start to
  mysteriously die.

886
01:11:02,256 --> 01:11:04,692
  - And you think it's
  some sort of curse?

887
01:11:04,759 --> 01:11:06,127
- Maybe.

888
01:11:06,194 --> 01:11:09,597
Maybe this missing mummy
isn't really missing.

889
01:11:09,664 --> 01:11:11,666
- Jim, I'm a scientist.

890
01:11:11,733 --> 01:11:12,767
  - And I'm a cowboy,

891
01:11:12,834 --> 01:11:14,602
   but just because a
   chicken has wings

892
01:11:14,669 --> 01:11:16,571
doesn't mean it can fly.

893
01:11:16,637 --> 01:11:17,905
  If you have a
  better explanation,

894
01:11:17,972 --> 01:11:19,107
I'd sure as hell
love to hear it.

895
01:11:19,173 --> 01:11:20,675
 - No, I don't.

896
01:11:20,742 --> 01:11:22,043
   But I know for a
   fact that mummies

897
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:25,847
  don't suddenly come to life
  and start killing people.

898
01:11:48,336 --> 01:11:50,872
   Jesus Christ, what
