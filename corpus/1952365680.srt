1
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:04,379
John F. Kennedy:
The very word "secrecy" is repugnant

2
00:00:04,418 --> 00:00:06,818
in a free and open society.

3
00:00:06,853 --> 00:00:10,516
Lyndon B. Johnson:
All I have I would have given gladly

4
00:00:10,557 --> 00:00:13,082
not to be standing here today.

5
00:00:13,126 --> 00:00:14,855
Kennedy:
... opposed to secret societies.

6
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:18,262
Richard Nixon: But when the president
does it, that means that it is not illegal.

7
00:00:18,298 --> 00:00:21,062
Lyndon B. Johnson: The world
will not be the same for our children.

8
00:00:21,101 --> 00:00:24,070
Gerald Ford: You have not chosen me
by secret ballot.

9
00:00:24,104 --> 00:00:26,095
Ronald Reagan:
We welcome change.

10
00:00:26,139 --> 00:00:28,630
We believe that freedom...

11
00:00:28,675 --> 00:00:30,734
George Bush Sr.:
I thank you for the wonderful things

12
00:00:30,777 --> 00:00:32,677
that you have done for America.

13
00:00:32,713 --> 00:00:34,806
Bill Clinton: Never before
has our nation enjoyed at once

14
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:37,749
so much prosperity
and social progress...

15
00:00:37,784 --> 00:00:41,447
George W. Bush:... the brightest beacon
for freedoms and opportunity in the world

16
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:44,924
and no one will keep
that light from shining.

17
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:49,019
Reporter:
Barack Obama took the railroad

18
00:00:49,062 --> 00:00:50,859
from Philadelphia
to Washington today.

19
00:00:50,897 --> 00:00:53,730
And it's not just the folks along the way
who were cheering him on.

20
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:56,895
A "CBS News"- "New York Times"
poll out this evening

21
00:00:56,937 --> 00:01:00,930
says 79% of Americans are optimistic
about his new administration.

22
00:01:00,974 --> 00:01:04,137
That's the highest level
for any modern president.

23
00:01:08,682 --> 00:01:10,877
Woman: Excuse me.
Do you mind if I sit here?

24
00:01:10,917 --> 00:01:14,409
- All the other tables are full.
- Man: No. Go right ahead.

25
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:36,106
I wish it was Sunday.

26
00:01:40,914 --> 00:01:44,680
How do I know for sure
you are who I think you are?

27
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,615
Well, for one, we were
just speaking in code.

28
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,426
And two...

29
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,952
I currently have a Para Carry 9mm
pointed squarely at your crotch.

30
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:04,502
I'm High Priestess.
Nice to meet you.

31
00:02:35,802 --> 00:02:39,329
- Well well well.
- Meet Chariot.

32
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:40,430
Your new boss.

33
00:02:40,474 --> 00:02:42,533
Man:
Uh, wait are all you guys

34
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:45,101
- named after Tarot cards?
- Yeah.

35
00:02:45,145 --> 00:02:47,272
Dumb fuckin' idea
if you ask me.

36
00:02:47,314 --> 00:02:49,839
- It's not that bad.
- Chariot: Jesus.

37
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:52,750
Great. One more goofy fuck.
That's all we need.

38
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:54,913
So you're some master thief
or something, huh?

39
00:02:54,955 --> 00:02:57,321
- I wouldn't say master thief-
- I tried to read your file

40
00:02:57,357 --> 00:03:00,292
but it bored the shit out of me.
"Thomas Crown" without the pussy.

41
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:01,919
Where'd you steal that suit?
Marshall's?

42
00:03:01,962 --> 00:03:05,454
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Don't even answer that question.

43
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:07,729
I got a kidney stone
passing through me right now.

44
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:09,462
And I don't want to murder you
on your first day.

45
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:13,064
Uh, okay. So do I get
to pick a Tarot card now?

46
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:14,266
Mmn.
The Fool.

47
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:15,797
The Fool?

48
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:18,902
Um, I was under the impression
we could choose our own code names.

49
00:03:21,114 --> 00:03:24,413
- So am I replacing somebody or-
- Strength.

50
00:03:24,451 --> 00:03:27,147
Yeah.
Apparently wasn't strong enough.

51
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:30,156
When God created Alpha and Omega.

52
00:03:34,394 --> 00:03:37,022
As of this moment you're
officially hired by The Factory-

53
00:03:37,063 --> 00:03:38,894
an elite espionage cell
ostensibly unacknowledged

54
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:42,493
by the U.S. government and staffed
by unofficial covert operatives.

55
00:03:42,536 --> 00:03:45,767
Chariot: The company was created
in 1962 by the DOD and the JCS

56
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:47,636
for the sole purpose
of false flag operations.

57
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:51,440
In 1967 LBJ implemented
the two-team system-

58
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:54,174
- Alpha and Omega.
- For what reason?

59
00:03:54,214 --> 00:03:56,774
To balance the power.

60
00:03:56,816 --> 00:03:58,681
Let's put it this way:
If it weren't for Omega-

61
00:03:58,718 --> 00:04:00,618
- Which is who?
- Us.

62
00:04:00,654 --> 00:04:02,588
- the middle east would be
a cloud of dust right now.

63
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:05,216
Uh, isn't the middle east
already kind of a cloud of dust?

64
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:08,159
- He meant literally.
- What does Alpha do?

65
00:04:08,194 --> 00:04:09,593
You know, the usual.

66
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:11,756
Some president, UN official,
American politician

67
00:04:11,798 --> 00:04:13,823
wants to talk shit about
the military industrial complex,

68
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:17,826
wants to stop spending $600 billion
on a war with no fucking end,

69
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:21,705
well, whether it be 1963 or now,
they intervene.

70
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:24,710
- And that's the least of it.
- And what about us? Omega.

71
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:27,975
We try to stop them
from bringing forth the apocalypse.

72
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:30,505
What's the need for any of it?
Don't you guys just negate each other?

73
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,247
Ha ha. Sweet nothing.
The black heart of our democracy.

74
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:36,881
So does anyone
oversee the two teams?

75
00:04:36,923 --> 00:04:38,220
- The Devil.
- The who?

76
00:04:38,258 --> 00:04:41,022
The Devil. It's not really
as ominous as it sounds.

77
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:43,791
He's a portly bastard
with manicured nails,

78
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,094
no real field experience
and the sharp wit

79
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:48,157
of a six-year-old autistic boy.

80
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:51,693
He's called The Devil because,
you know, it's spooky.

81
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:03,247
Oh. Company policy.
Boss is afraid one of us is gonna kill him.

82
00:05:03,283 --> 00:05:06,741
Though I could just as easily
snap his neck as shoot him,

83
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:08,947
it's all for show.

84
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:12,888
Plus it looks really cool
when we unload our weapons.

85
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,441
Oh, come on, fucking-
who works the Monday morning shift?

86
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,641
Is it Neil?
It's Neil, isn't it?

87
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:37,206
That fucking-

88
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,718
I once waited here
for 20 minutes.

89
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:41,653
Oh, come on, people.
Let's go!

90
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:43,656
Open the door, fuckhead!

91
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,558
Here we go.

92
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:50,620
Oh, you fucking retard,
open the door.

93
00:05:50,664 --> 00:05:53,531
Open the fucking
door right now.

94
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:55,625
Who is that?
Get down here.

95
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:59,628
Get down here 'cause I wanna see
your stupid handicapped fucking face

96
00:05:59,673 --> 00:06:03,234
in front of mine
while I gut you like a fucking piglet.

97
00:06:03,276 --> 00:06:04,607
So get the fuck down here...

98
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:07,408
Chariot is so drunk
he doesn't even know it's Tuesday.

99
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:09,039
Are you gonna let him in?

100
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:10,640
No, let him wait.

101
00:06:10,684 --> 00:06:13,312
It's my favorite time of the day.

102
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:17,084
I'm gonna eat your fucking heart
and your brain-

103
00:06:17,123 --> 00:06:20,115
I'm gonna fucking
rape your soul.

104
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,721
You have to admit,
he's pretty good at those insults.

105
00:06:23,763 --> 00:06:25,355
Oh, he's an asshole.

106
00:06:25,398 --> 00:06:28,094
I used one the other day
on my ex-wife.

107
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:29,829
What did you say to her?

108
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:32,702
Remember when he told you
that he was gonna peel your skin off

109
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:35,037
and dry it in the sun

110
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:37,805
and use it as a condom
and fuck your mother?

111
00:06:37,844 --> 00:06:39,812
You said that
to your ex-wife?

112
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:41,313
Well, I was mad.

113
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:44,475
You better watch out. She's gonna
end up keeping Bobby all the time.

114
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:45,745
- Should we let him in?
- Chariot: I'm gonna snap

115
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:48,345
- my fucking fingers, okay?
- I guess, yeah.

116
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:51,050
I hope you die
of testicular cancer.

117
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:53,753
You fucking mongoloid.

118
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:56,193
Open the-
oh, thank you.

119
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:59,756
- Chariot: Never mind.
- You do this every morning?

120
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:03,428
No, I drink as much as I do
because every day is Christmas.

121
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:14,244
All right, so what happens
if that door malfunctions?

122
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,544
How do we get out?

123
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,483
You don't.

124
00:07:18,518 --> 00:07:21,544
Shut the door, bitch.
You live in a barn?

125
00:07:25,225 --> 00:07:27,989
Rude.

126
00:07:29,896 --> 00:07:31,124
You wanna do
the introductions?

127
00:07:31,164 --> 00:07:33,257
No, my fucking feet hurt.

128
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:36,666
Great, I'll do it.
Thank you. I'll keep talking.

129
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,001
If we're heading up Omega Team,

130
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:41,370
Emperor spent over
30 years in the field on active duty.

131
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:47,145
See that Cro-Magnon fuck
right there?

132
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,707
That's Judgement.
Deals solely with IT and Demolitions.

133
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,718
A real piece of work.

134
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:54,583
The rest of his energy's
spent saying shit like,

135
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:57,351
"It's Judgement time, baby. "

136
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,484
But he can take down
a 747 using only his iPhone.

137
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:04,523
Basically,
he's like a black MacGyver,

138
00:08:04,564 --> 00:08:05,758
but without the fancy mullet.

139
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:09,394
Hey!
Where the fuck is Alpha Team?

140
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:13,831
Shit, man.

141
00:08:13,873 --> 00:08:15,670
Something's up.

142
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,938
Empress walked in here
and the skirt wrapped up her hips

143
00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:19,968
like a motherfucking ligature.

144
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:22,208
Now the last time
she donned an outfit

145
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:24,239
so damn libidinous

146
00:08:24,284 --> 00:08:26,514
was the day they whacked
Benazir Bhutto.

147
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:28,180
Who's Empress?

148
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:29,779
Who the fuck are you?

149
00:08:29,823 --> 00:08:33,122
I- I um-

150
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,559
You're about as smooth
as a three-month-old bikini wax.

151
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:38,189
Yeah, he is.
He's endearingly retarded.

152
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:42,863
Chariot: I love you.

153
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:46,303
Ah, Alpha Team!

154
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:49,433
Whee!

155
00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:52,205
That's Magician.
Alpha's econo-terrorist.

156
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:53,974
Let me just tell you this.
The reason the third world

157
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:56,072
is still the third world
is 'cause of that asshole.

158
00:08:56,115 --> 00:08:59,050
CD of Alpha Team occupies
my slot on the other side.

159
00:08:59,085 --> 00:09:02,486
His work in Florida in 2000
really put him on the map.

160
00:09:02,522 --> 00:09:03,887
Queen of Spades.

161
00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:06,153
That's Tower.

162
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:08,490
Our youngest recruit,
straight out of college.

163
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:12,487
No-sock-loafer-wearing
Georgetown-educated-black-Republican,

164
00:09:12,532 --> 00:09:14,500
most likely still a virgin.

165
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:16,502
Not a fan of Osama.

166
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,904
Hierophant-
conceived in the bowels

167
00:09:23,943 --> 00:09:25,672
of a megachurch laboratory.

168
00:09:25,712 --> 00:09:28,237
Giggly, cute,

169
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:29,441
fucking nut.

170
00:09:29,482 --> 00:09:30,574
Watch out.

171
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:36,051
Very dramatic.
Watch this. That was for us.

172
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:38,785
She knows we're watching.

173
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:40,190
Nice.

174
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:43,627
All right, everybody's back
from Virginia and accounted for.

175
00:09:43,663 --> 00:09:46,188
Check it out.
It's all over the news.

176
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:48,359
Woman: Government authorities
have no further comment

177
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:51,268
about the warehouse fire
that killed three civilians

178
00:09:51,304 --> 00:09:53,363
and an unidentified fourth man,

179
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:55,340
whose name has not
been released.

180
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:58,708
Apparently that's where all
the Cheney death squad files are kept.

181
00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:01,043
Yeah, I told you that.

182
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,547
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

183
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:04,880
- When?
- Two weeks ago.

184
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:06,317
Woman:
... to the adjacent parking lot.

185
00:10:06,352 --> 00:10:08,820
Authorities have confirmed
that the cause of the fire

186
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:12,154
was an explosion that occurred
because of a gas leak.

187
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:14,022
Gas leak, right.

188
00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:17,119
Woman: The warehouse,
dubbed a safe house

189
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:19,495
by the Department of Defense,
was a storage facility

190
00:10:19,532 --> 00:10:22,797
for government documents
reaching back 50 years.

191
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:30,036
Look, Empress, we all know
Project Safe House was messy.

192
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:32,909
Messy?
You think it was messy?

193
00:10:32,946 --> 00:10:34,413
I talked to Emperor.

194
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:37,814
I talked to Chariot.

195
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,613
What do you want me say?

196
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:42,212
Nothing. You look too fucking good
with your mouth closed.

197
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:45,224
- Come on.
- Let me tell you something, Devil.

198
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:47,522
We, I,

199
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,687
this entire fucking office

200
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:52,823
can smell pussy
right where pussy sits.

201
00:10:52,865 --> 00:10:56,665
Glad to see menopause
hasn't affected your mood.

202
00:10:56,703 --> 00:10:59,729
Yeah, and I don't have to worry
about getting pregnant anymore, either.

203
00:10:59,772 --> 00:11:02,832
Yeah, what?

204
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:06,367
Oh, wow! Look at you.

205
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:07,777
You vixen.

206
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:10,408
What are you,
entering a slut contest?

207
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,475
Why don't you find
a nice little bathroom stall

208
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:14,679
to go fuck yourself in?

209
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:17,656
All right, all right,
language, please.

210
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,989
- Is this the new addition to Omega?
- Yeah.

211
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:24,724
Wow! What was wrong
with the redhead?

212
00:11:24,764 --> 00:11:28,632
She was nice.
She was tall, stately, affable.

213
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:30,636
No, she was nice.

214
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,900
Way to welcome
the new boy, asshole.

215
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:35,874
I was gonna let the walls
of your vagina do that.

216
00:11:35,908 --> 00:11:37,876
What's that awful smell?
Did you just shit yourself again?

217
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,242
- Come on, come on, come on.
- I'm wearing a diaper.

218
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,577
Empress:
Oh, Jesus Christ.

219
00:11:42,615 --> 00:11:44,207
You fucking reek.

220
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,377
Yeah. Oh, by the way,
this 50-year-old firecracker-

221
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:49,582
- 49.
- 49-year-old firecracker right here-

222
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:53,581
- Well, I am 49
- I get it, okay?

223
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:55,059
This is the Empress.

224
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:57,085
Most notorious agent
1980s America

225
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,394
never knew anything about.

226
00:11:59,432 --> 00:12:01,457
Currently the exec
of Alpha Team.

227
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:05,460
Be a gentleman.
Introduce yourself, come on.

228
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:07,564
The Fool, I'm a-

229
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:09,632
Charmed, I'm sure.

230
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:12,508
And there's the Devil.

231
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:13,944
Pleasure to meet you
too, sir.

232
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,005
I'm sorry about the redhead.

233
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:17,846
No need to worry.

234
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:20,717
We'll get you a little wig.
Anyway, come over here.

235
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:22,186
I wanna show you something.

236
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:24,655
Now this, my friend,

237
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,658
it's a rather rare item.

238
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:29,957
It was awarded to me
for a little job I did in Prague

239
00:12:29,996 --> 00:12:31,725
- a couple of decades back.
- You oversaw, sir-

240
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:33,322
a job you oversaw.

241
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:36,460
Oversaw. Semantics,
you know, this is just semantics.

242
00:12:36,502 --> 00:12:40,302
I mean, I just prefer
that my accomplishments resonate

243
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:41,829
in a more tangible-

244
00:12:41,874 --> 00:12:44,399
Something's not right.

245
00:12:44,444 --> 00:12:46,173
The Devil's acting weird,
even for him.

246
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:48,180
I know.

247
00:12:48,214 --> 00:12:50,341
I heard he has a thing
for phone sex.

248
00:12:50,383 --> 00:12:54,319
He's been calling 1-900 numbers
on Uncle Sam's dime?

249
00:12:54,353 --> 00:12:56,548
- No, it's someone he knows.
- What?

250
00:12:58,224 --> 00:13:00,784
I accidentally overhead a call.

251
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:03,853
- Carl.
- I know. I know.

252
00:13:03,896 --> 00:13:07,332
I wonder who it is.
She sounds Slovakian.

253
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:10,335
So I keep that
as a reminder of my 12 co-workers.

254
00:13:10,369 --> 00:13:13,304
Oh, and as a little reminder

255
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:14,738
of teamwork.

256
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:20,737
What are you laughing at?

257
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,407
What did I just say?

258
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:25,474
- Teamwork, sir.
- You see, no one questioned authority.

259
00:13:25,518 --> 00:13:27,952
Hey, Carl, look.

260
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:29,818
No one questioned

261
00:13:29,856 --> 00:13:32,552
the decisions of management.

262
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,660
Each one of us did our job,

263
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:39,722
because to do otherwise...

264
00:13:39,765 --> 00:13:41,426
What the hell
are you doing, old man?

265
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:43,059
Is that thing loaded?

266
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,733
Oh! Fucking nutbag.

267
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:52,107
He is just out
of his mind.

268
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:55,444
Now...

269
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:57,676
it's a good thing that
this baby hasn't been fired

270
00:13:57,717 --> 00:13:59,207
in a hundred years.

271
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:02,585
Otherwise, well, my brains
would just be on the carpet.

272
00:14:02,622 --> 00:14:04,385
- Yes!
- Sorry to bother. I just-

273
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:10,226
Was-

274
00:14:12,098 --> 00:14:14,726
Do you find sometimes
a pregnant pause

275
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:17,895
- just says it all?
- Yes, sir, the tension's palpable.

276
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:19,700
Empress: I'm hot.

277
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:23,436
Yes. Yes.
Do you care to fill us in?

278
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:27,242
- Me and-
- Temperance.

279
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:34,117
Temperance, we-

280
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:36,383
- Trained together.
- Right.

281
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:37,889
Oh, I love to train.

282
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:40,620
- A couple of years ago.
- Right, a couple of years ago.

283
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,719
Well, let's hope that
fluorescent lighting

284
00:14:42,762 --> 00:14:44,923
will rekindle your romance,

285
00:14:44,964 --> 00:14:46,955
but we have a briefing

286
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:50,833
in 30 minutes, 10:10.
Leave.

287
00:14:57,109 --> 00:14:59,805
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Hey! We'll talk.

288
00:14:59,845 --> 00:15:02,541
- You gonna order out today?
- Did you just vomit in your mouth?

289
00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:08,784
Man, Temperance is hot
to trot, my man.

290
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:12,188
She's built
like a fucking thoroughbred. Uhh!

291
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:16,127
Body is a well-oiled machine.

292
00:15:16,162 --> 00:15:19,131
I want the details, dude,
all the fucking details.

293
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:21,030
There's nothing to be said.
We dated. We broke up.

294
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:23,900
Dude, I don't give a shit
about your relationship.

295
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:25,665
I wanna know
what she's like in bed.

296
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:28,936
Man, what do her
insides feel like? Tell me.

297
00:15:28,975 --> 00:15:31,409
All right, look,
let's just leave it, okay, all right?

298
00:15:31,444 --> 00:15:35,107
- Okay.
- What does she do here anyway?

299
00:15:35,147 --> 00:15:37,411
Seduction mostly.

300
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,918
I mean, yeah, she gathers a little intel
after the deed is done,

301
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:41,920
but mostly she just
fucks dudes.

302
00:15:41,954 --> 00:15:45,515
All right, well, who?

303
00:15:45,558 --> 00:15:48,356
- Which ones?
- Oh my God.

304
00:15:48,394 --> 00:15:50,362
You ever heard of Bill Clinton?

305
00:15:50,396 --> 00:15:52,455
- Oh, you're kidding.
- Yeah, fucked that guy.

306
00:15:52,498 --> 00:15:55,934
Vladimir Putin
put it in her bum.

307
00:15:55,968 --> 00:15:58,061
That's what I hear.

308
00:15:58,104 --> 00:16:00,436
- She fucked Putin?
- That's what I heard.

309
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:02,964
She wasn't working.
She just did that.

310
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:04,340
Okay, all right.

311
00:16:04,377 --> 00:16:08,006
- Ever heard of the Dalai Lama?
- Yeah.

312
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:10,379
Relax, she's fucked
a lot of old dudes in the ass.

313
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,611
- Okay, all right, all right.
- Everywhere. Mao.

314
00:16:12,652 --> 00:16:14,483
Now leave it alone.

315
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,047
- In the face.
- Okay, all right, leave it.

316
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,955
Voilà.

317
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:22,426
That's French.

318
00:16:22,461 --> 00:16:25,055
Am I smaller
than everyone else is?

319
00:16:25,097 --> 00:16:27,224
And there's a column
in the middle.

320
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:30,633
Yeah, well,
it's 'cause it's your first day.

321
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,695
And you're a fucking loser.

322
00:16:44,784 --> 00:16:46,342
Neil:
Who the hell is this guy?

323
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:49,616
His background data file
is corrupted. I can't open it.

324
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:52,215
Call Susan in Human Resources.
Have her send some guy down

325
00:16:52,258 --> 00:16:54,385
with a hard copy
of his file.

326
00:16:54,427 --> 00:16:57,021
- You call Susan.
- You call her.

327
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:59,088
- You call her. You call her.
- You call her.

328
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:00,792
Just be a man and call her.

329
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,131
- I think you're afraid of her.
- I think you're afraid of her too.

330
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:06,036
Well, no shit.
She freaks me out.

331
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:08,700
I'll call her.

332
00:17:08,741 --> 00:17:11,539
Thank you, Neil.

333
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:14,407
I'll tell you right now,
Empress is planning something.

334
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:16,608
She's been talking to Corporate.
I know that.

335
00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:18,742
What does that even mean?

336
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:20,274
I just don't trust her.

337
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,117
Safe House went south.
Corporate's livid. That's a big deal.

338
00:17:23,155 --> 00:17:25,385
Well, Safe House
wasn't our fault.

339
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:27,392
The outside hire screwed it

340
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:29,792
and we're not to blame.

341
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:32,161
I say we watch her
and we watch Alpha Team.

342
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:34,166
I got a bad feeling
about this.

343
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,328
You sure that's just
the DTs talking?

344
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,770
I'm still drunk,
so it can't be the DTs.

345
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:41,773
There you go.
You corrected me.

346
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:05,623
Excuse me, Tower.

347
00:18:05,664 --> 00:18:09,259
Do you know where
the meeting is today?

348
00:18:17,176 --> 00:18:20,145
You're bewilderment level
is here.

349
00:18:21,614 --> 00:18:23,809
It should come down
to there.

350
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:25,976
Cool?

351
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:36,795
Putin?

352
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:39,627
- What? What are you talking about?
- You slept with Putin?

353
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:42,327
Really?
Is this who you've become?

354
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:45,633
- Go to hell.
- Oh, really?

355
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:47,969
- I thought I knew you.
- We don't exactly work at Walmart.

356
00:18:48,007 --> 00:18:51,067
Deception comes
with the territory and plus,

357
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,078
what the fuck
do you think you're doing here?

358
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:54,909
- What am I doing here?
- Is this your plan?

359
00:18:54,947 --> 00:18:56,915
Is this some kind
of sick plot?

360
00:18:56,949 --> 00:18:58,746
- No.
- Huh?

361
00:18:58,784 --> 00:19:01,719
No.

362
00:19:25,644 --> 00:19:29,580
Barack Obama: I thank President Bush
for his service to our nation.

363
00:19:33,118 --> 00:19:35,416
As well as the generosity...

364
00:19:35,454 --> 00:19:38,548
Oh, God damn it! Now the entire
surveillance system has a bug.

365
00:19:38,591 --> 00:19:40,081
We're gonna crash.

366
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,616
Just reboot the system.

367
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:45,186
- Are you legs broken?
- No, but come on, I'll do it.

368
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:47,722
- I'll do it. I'll be happy to do it.
- Okay, well, chop-chop.

369
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:56,600
You better pray that we
didn't lose anything on the hard drive.

370
00:19:56,642 --> 00:19:58,269
Are you blaming this on me?

371
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,211
No, I'm just saying I hope
we didn't lose anything.

372
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:03,340
Well, I hope we didn't
lose anything, either, Carl.

373
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:06,909
Well, good, Neil.
Then we're all in agreement.

374
00:20:06,952 --> 00:20:09,250
Yeah, come in.

375
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:14,182
What do you want?

376
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,062
I knew it would be you.

377
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:22,465
All right, it's half up.

378
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:25,800
Jesus, why's it so slow?

379
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:33,944
He's good. He's good,
but that black-haired girl.

380
00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:36,846
When she sang that
Captain & Tennille song last night,

381
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:39,578
I was floored.
I just had to vote for her.

382
00:20:39,618 --> 00:20:42,451
- You vote?
- Every single frickin' time.

383
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:44,149
I love that show.

384
00:20:44,189 --> 00:20:47,090
Judgement: I love it too.
I like that guy Enrique.

385
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:48,491
Now Enrique,
he's good.

386
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:51,018
I would have voted for him.
I would have given him a 10

387
00:20:51,063 --> 00:20:53,531
if I was a judge.

388
00:20:56,368 --> 00:20:59,769
What the fuck is wrong with you? Did your
mother put mercury in your milk bottle?

389
00:20:59,805 --> 00:21:02,467
Baby, you keep talking
to me like that,

390
00:21:02,508 --> 00:21:04,840
I'm gonna pound you
with my gavel.

391
00:21:04,877 --> 00:21:06,640
The fat part
or the skinny part?

392
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:11,812
Oh, God.

393
00:21:13,018 --> 00:21:16,977
Are we waiting for something
to happen here, huh, Chariot?

394
00:21:17,022 --> 00:21:18,853
Ah! Finger, finger, finger,

395
00:21:18,891 --> 00:21:20,654
finger, finger,

396
00:21:20,693 --> 00:21:22,854
Where is the Devil?
It's 10:17 already.

397
00:21:22,895 --> 00:21:25,659
I'll go find him. Be back
in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

398
00:21:25,698 --> 00:21:28,292
The Hermit,
we're missing the Hermit.

399
00:21:29,768 --> 00:21:32,464
Back online.

400
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:37,039
Oh, fuck!

401
00:21:37,076 --> 00:21:39,874
Someone crashed the system
on purpose.

402
00:21:46,385 --> 00:21:49,354
Does that alarm mean
what I think it means?

403
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:51,322
Project Endgame.

404
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,887
Fuck.

405
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:03,168
Carl, he's dead.

406
00:22:05,304 --> 00:22:07,704
Well well well,
and pencils too.

407
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,368
Nicely sharpened, not bad.

408
00:22:16,281 --> 00:22:18,408
What the fuck happened here?

409
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,850
This must be the work
of the Hermit.

410
00:22:20,886 --> 00:22:23,719
- Oh, shit.
- What?

411
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:26,190
He activated
Project Endgame.

412
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:28,785
Sorry, what?

413
00:22:28,827 --> 00:22:31,125
Project Endgame
is The Factory's be-all,

414
00:22:31,163 --> 00:22:33,131
end-all contingency device.

415
00:22:33,165 --> 00:22:35,827
It activates a physical
and communicative lockdown

416
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:38,962
before setting a timer
that will vaporize this place

417
00:22:39,004 --> 00:22:40,699
at the end of two hours.

418
00:22:40,739 --> 00:22:42,639
I guess Judgement Day
is upon us.

419
00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:46,236
Oh my God. We get it.
Your name is Judgement.

420
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:48,542
Hey, you know what?
You guys have been great.

421
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,707
- I'm gonna go drink myself to death.
- Shut the fuck up, Chariot!

422
00:22:50,749 --> 00:22:53,149
Chug my cock.

423
00:22:53,185 --> 00:22:55,210
Why would the bomb be on
a timer when the whole place

424
00:22:55,254 --> 00:22:57,222
is locked down and nobody can get out?
Doesn't make sense.

425
00:22:57,256 --> 00:23:00,248
Well, the man in charge
had access to some emergency exits.

426
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:02,260
That's the rumor anyways.

427
00:23:02,294 --> 00:23:05,855
The timer gave him a chance to collect
his things and tie up any loose ends.

428
00:23:05,898 --> 00:23:08,594
- Man, this is bullshit.
- No movement recorded

429
00:23:08,634 --> 00:23:11,000
in the elevators
in the last hour.

430
00:23:11,036 --> 00:23:14,597
Oh my God. That means
that the killer is among us.

431
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,437
What about the surveillance tapes?

432
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:19,273
There's no way to review 'em from here.
They go directly to Corporate.

433
00:23:19,311 --> 00:23:22,769
Who gives a shit?
We're gonna die. Let's all fuck!

434
00:23:22,815 --> 00:23:25,181
Well, can we disarm it?

435
00:23:25,217 --> 00:23:27,185
- I would assume.
- None of us has the code.

436
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:29,244
- Of course.
- Where would it be?

437
00:23:29,288 --> 00:23:32,189
How many fucking questions
are you gonna ask?

438
00:23:32,224 --> 00:23:34,385
God damn it!
Can we just deal with the situation?

439
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:37,725
Thank you, Temperance.
We've all seen far worse than this.

440
00:23:37,763 --> 00:23:39,253
Back to the conference room.

441
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:41,960
Today's staff meeting
means something a little different.

442
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,861
Do you think we're safe?

443
00:23:49,074 --> 00:23:51,406
Yes, we're safe.

444
00:23:51,443 --> 00:23:52,910
We're safe.
We're not down there.

445
00:23:52,945 --> 00:23:54,936
I'm glad we're up here.

446
00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:00,049
Sorry, assholes.

447
00:24:06,892 --> 00:24:09,360
Priority one is a top to bottom sweep
of this facility.

448
00:24:09,394 --> 00:24:12,124
We're looking for hollow walls,
secret doorways,

449
00:24:12,164 --> 00:24:14,655
tunnels and-or elevators.

450
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,668
Secondly,
we need to find Hermit.

451
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:19,569
He knew this place
better than anyone.

452
00:24:19,605 --> 00:24:22,403
I'm sure he had
an escape route.

453
00:24:22,441 --> 00:24:25,308
The Fool:
Who's the Hermit?

454
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,608
Hermit used
to do assassinations

455
00:24:27,646 --> 00:24:30,877
until he got diabetes.
Fat fuck.

456
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,441
He's a good agent, though.

457
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:36,386
Sounds like one
of the only people you respect.

458
00:24:36,421 --> 00:24:39,049
No, I'm just afraid of him.

459
00:24:39,091 --> 00:24:41,059
I'm gonna find that little
gummy ass bitch, and when I do,

460
00:24:41,093 --> 00:24:42,754
I'm gonna blow his ass up.

461
00:24:42,795 --> 00:24:45,161
Good to hear your enthusiasm,
Judgement.

462
00:24:45,197 --> 00:24:48,928
I say we pair up,
one Alpha, one Omega.

463
00:24:48,967 --> 00:24:51,800
I agree.
We each pair up with our mirror agent

464
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:53,429
on the opposing team.

465
00:24:53,472 --> 00:24:55,440
Keep an eye on each other.

466
00:24:55,474 --> 00:24:57,408
Alpha and Omega are working
together on this one.

467
00:24:57,442 --> 00:25:00,434
Keep in mind the Hermit
is an incredibly skilled agent.

468
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:02,845
If you need a weapon,

469
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:04,906
you can commandeer anything
you can find

470
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,941
in and around the office.

471
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:12,648
The most powerful weapon

472
00:25:12,691 --> 00:25:15,251
is the human soul on fire.

473
00:25:15,294 --> 00:25:16,454
Oh my God.

474
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:19,225
Motherfucker,
did you just quote Nietzsche?

475
00:25:19,264 --> 00:25:22,563
Finally! We've been
calling you for 10 minutes.

476
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:25,866
- Calm down, calm down.
- They activated Project Endgame.

477
00:25:25,904 --> 00:25:27,303
Buck up.
I was on a phone call.

478
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:29,534
- What do you mean "buck up"?
- Shut up!

479
00:25:29,575 --> 00:25:31,543
My God, you two.

480
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:33,636
There's the file
on the new recruit, aka the Fool.

481
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,137
He's nobody. What happened?
You couldn't get into the mainframe?

482
00:25:37,182 --> 00:25:38,649
No, it wouldn't let us.

483
00:25:38,684 --> 00:25:42,586
That is so odd.
Let me try my security code.

484
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:46,148
- Did you reboot?
- Of course.

485
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:49,217
Hmm. Hmm.

486
00:25:49,261 --> 00:25:50,888
Look at that.

487
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:58,136
Very clever.

488
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,297
What do you mean?

489
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:04,241
Secret Service changes
the security codes today at noon.

490
00:26:04,276 --> 00:26:06,005
Now it doesn't matter.

491
00:26:06,044 --> 00:26:09,707
They'll all burn
in a flood of napalm.

492
00:26:09,748 --> 00:26:12,512
Poor psychopaths.

493
00:26:20,692 --> 00:26:21,954
This is about Safe House.

494
00:26:21,994 --> 00:26:25,623
It was Devil's operation.
He fucked up. He's fucked up before.

495
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:29,657
The Factory's never been squeamish
about civilian casualties.

496
00:26:29,701 --> 00:26:33,159
However, Corporate
has never been fond

497
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:34,866
of loose ends,

498
00:26:34,907 --> 00:26:37,171
and Safe House had
plenty of those.

499
00:26:37,209 --> 00:26:40,201
You know,
before you opened your mouth,

500
00:26:40,245 --> 00:26:43,806
I actually entertained
the possibility of fucking you one last time.

501
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:45,544
It was that fleeting, huh?

502
00:26:45,584 --> 00:26:47,017
I know.
It's unfortunate, right?

503
00:26:47,052 --> 00:26:49,680
- It's too bad.
- Yeah.

504
00:26:49,721 --> 00:26:52,121
Hey, you remember that night

505
00:26:52,157 --> 00:26:54,182
in London
when it was raining?

506
00:26:54,226 --> 00:26:56,023
You were wearing
those high heels.

507
00:26:56,061 --> 00:26:59,121
We were walking down
the cobblestone streets

508
00:26:59,164 --> 00:27:01,223
and a fog rolled in

509
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:04,497
and we ducked down
that alley?

510
00:27:04,536 --> 00:27:06,697
One of us didn't finish.

511
00:27:06,738 --> 00:27:08,399
Yeah,
you didn't finish.

512
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,034
I think it was-

513
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:13,067
You killed the Devil,
didn't you?

514
00:27:19,184 --> 00:27:20,913
Oh!

515
00:27:39,638 --> 00:27:41,833
- Ew! Ew!
- Carl: Oh!

516
00:27:41,873 --> 00:27:44,364
- Oh.
- Oh my God!

517
00:27:58,156 --> 00:27:59,714
Jesus Christ,
I know they hate each other,

518
00:27:59,758 --> 00:28:02,056
but what the fuck?

519
00:28:09,768 --> 00:28:11,827
Let me ask you a question.

520
00:28:15,073 --> 00:28:17,200
5'3".

521
00:28:18,443 --> 00:28:20,968
99 and a quarter pounds.

522
00:28:21,013 --> 00:28:24,608
Skin like a porcelain mug

523
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:26,981
full of lactate.

524
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,152
Nipples...

525
00:28:31,189 --> 00:28:34,784
size of a baby's fingernails.

526
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:38,393
What's the question?

527
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:43,560
You be the judge.

528
00:28:46,405 --> 00:28:49,431
Can I ask you a question?

529
00:28:49,474 --> 00:28:52,068
I'm nine and a half.

530
00:28:53,178 --> 00:28:55,078
Uncut.

531
00:28:55,113 --> 00:28:56,580
Ew! No!

532
00:28:56,615 --> 00:28:59,914
I was gonna ask if, like,
you believe in heaven and hell,

533
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:01,646
and all that stuff.

534
00:29:05,891 --> 00:29:08,587
Okay, I'm gonna
check these files.

535
00:29:08,627 --> 00:29:11,425
You check these bookshelves. Look for
any clues as to what the phrase may be.

536
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,565
Where the answer is yes,
we intend to move forward.

537
00:29:22,607 --> 00:29:26,338
Where the answer is no,
programs will end.

538
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:28,471
And those of us who manage
the public's dollars

539
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:30,105
will be held to account

540
00:29:30,148 --> 00:29:32,412
and do our business
in the light of day

541
00:29:32,451 --> 00:29:35,477
because only then can we restore
the vital trust

542
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,454
between a people
and their government.

543
00:29:37,489 --> 00:29:41,323
Can you believe this?

544
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:43,691
70 years of government fuckups
all in one room.

545
00:29:43,728 --> 00:29:46,561
I bet you half of these
are from the past eight years.

546
00:29:46,598 --> 00:29:49,533
I don't see why we have to
stand by and watch a country

547
00:29:49,568 --> 00:29:52,731
befall to Communism due
to the irresponsibility of its people.

548
00:29:54,506 --> 00:29:56,974
Do you ever wonder
if you've chosen the right profession?

549
00:29:57,008 --> 00:29:58,305
Right.

550
00:29:58,343 --> 00:30:02,302
I mean, I feel like I have
some pretty serious skills.

551
00:30:02,347 --> 00:30:06,147
I'm highly organized.
I'm motivated.

552
00:30:06,184 --> 00:30:08,812
I'm attractive.

553
00:30:08,854 --> 00:30:10,845
I am.

554
00:30:10,889 --> 00:30:13,824
I could be running
News Corp right now.

555
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:16,350
Or I could be a chef.

556
00:30:16,394 --> 00:30:19,420
Or a sous chef.

557
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:21,625
You know, instead,
I kill people for a living,

558
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:23,634
and you know, I don't know.

559
00:30:23,668 --> 00:30:26,330
I feel like I might have made

560
00:30:26,371 --> 00:30:27,998
a bad career choice.

561
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:31,133
You know what I mean?

562
00:30:31,176 --> 00:30:33,235
Tower?

563
00:30:41,753 --> 00:30:44,187
It's a hollow area.
You hear that?

564
00:30:44,222 --> 00:30:46,281
No, my ears are shot.

565
00:30:46,324 --> 00:30:48,292
I'm going right through the wall.

566
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:50,055
Let me see that leg.

567
00:30:56,968 --> 00:30:58,993
Oh, God!

568
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:01,704
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

569
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,765
- Susan: Oh my God.
- Neil: Oh my God.

570
00:31:03,808 --> 00:31:05,639
What is happening?

571
00:31:05,677 --> 00:31:08,043
Judgement,

572
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:12,072
I kind of sort of
have to confess something to you.

573
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:16,817
The real reason that
I asked you

574
00:31:16,855 --> 00:31:19,187
about heaven and all that stuff

575
00:31:19,224 --> 00:31:22,523
is because I totally knew
this time was coming.

576
00:31:22,561 --> 00:31:25,724
And really makes me upset
that you haven't accepted Christ

577
00:31:25,764 --> 00:31:27,789
as your lord and savior.

578
00:31:27,832 --> 00:31:31,165
Because I think you're,
like, really sweet

579
00:31:31,203 --> 00:31:35,003
and I just don't wanna think
of you melting

580
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,907
in Satan's lake of fire
for all eternity.

581
00:31:37,943 --> 00:31:41,743
I mean, that's just
fucking depressing, you know?

582
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,771
So, like,

583
00:31:43,815 --> 00:31:46,010
do you wanna take
these last couple of seconds

584
00:31:46,051 --> 00:31:48,576
to accept Christ as your
lord and savior?

585
00:31:50,855 --> 00:31:53,187
What? I can't...

586
00:31:53,225 --> 00:31:56,888
I can't...

587
00:32:00,131 --> 00:32:02,691
What? I can't...

588
00:32:08,373 --> 00:32:10,773
I can't believe I once
applied for his job.

589
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:12,208
What?

590
00:32:12,244 --> 00:32:15,042
Five years ago,
I applied to join Omega.

591
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,048
Were you too crazy?

592
00:32:17,082 --> 00:32:18,913
No, not crazy enough.

593
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:22,545
On the third interview,
they make you kill a puppy.

594
00:32:24,322 --> 00:32:27,450
You mean all those
people killed puppies?

595
00:32:39,838 --> 00:32:41,703
I couldn't do it.

596
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,732
I could kill a cat.

597
00:32:51,116 --> 00:32:53,277
Tower.

598
00:32:59,257 --> 00:33:01,248
Tower.

599
00:33:04,863 --> 00:33:07,627
You know, I was just thinking.
Remember that time we drove down

600
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:09,395
to Bethany Beach

601
00:33:09,434 --> 00:33:11,402
and you wouldn't get
on the ferris wheel?

602
00:33:11,436 --> 00:33:13,996
I kept begging you
and begging you

603
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:17,008
to where you started to scream
so loudly that those cops showed up

604
00:33:17,042 --> 00:33:19,442
on those little scooters.
You remember that?

605
00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:23,277
What are you,
getting all sentimental?

606
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:26,116
No.

607
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:28,881
No, I was just thinking about it.
That's all.

608
00:33:30,388 --> 00:33:33,516
I guess I was

609
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:35,287
thinking that you're
a lot more confident

610
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:38,353
than you used to be.

611
00:33:38,396 --> 00:33:40,523
Well, maybe I am.

612
00:33:40,565 --> 00:33:43,125
That's a gun?

613
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,533
You have a gun?

614
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:46,537
Firing pin, cartridge, primer,

615
00:33:46,571 --> 00:33:50,098
end cap.

616
00:33:50,141 --> 00:33:52,803
Bang bang, cowboy.

617
00:33:52,844 --> 00:33:54,539
It's very funny.

618
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:57,070
You've grown up too,
you know?

619
00:33:57,115 --> 00:33:59,379
You lost that stupid grin
of yours.

620
00:34:00,518 --> 00:34:02,543
Maybe that's because I'm looking
at you right now thinking about

621
00:34:02,587 --> 00:34:04,782
in an hour,
none of this will matter.

622
00:34:04,823 --> 00:34:06,791
Yeah, and if
you knew for sure

623
00:34:06,825 --> 00:34:09,055
that there was no escape,

624
00:34:09,094 --> 00:34:12,222
how would you spend
that last hour?

625
00:34:12,263 --> 00:34:15,699
- Honestly?
- Honestly.

626
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:36,314
Bang.

627
00:34:36,354 --> 00:34:38,652
You're dead.

628
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,352
That's hilarious.

629
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:46,123
Hey, just out of curiosity,

630
00:34:46,164 --> 00:34:49,190
what happened to you?

631
00:34:49,234 --> 00:34:51,759
I mean, when I first got here,

632
00:34:51,803 --> 00:34:53,668
you were the shit.

633
00:34:53,705 --> 00:34:56,833
I wanted to be you.

634
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,809
Now, you know,
you're like-

635
00:34:58,843 --> 00:35:00,538
I don't know.

636
00:35:00,578 --> 00:35:04,241
You're borderline homeless.

637
00:35:04,282 --> 00:35:08,218
You're a fucking deadbeat.

638
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:13,949
Yeah, well,
look on the bright side.

639
00:35:13,992 --> 00:35:15,755
My poetry's
really coming along.

640
00:35:15,794 --> 00:35:18,957
Oh, okay, so everything is
just a joke for you, right?

641
00:35:20,598 --> 00:35:24,056
Does that make you
feel better?

642
00:35:24,102 --> 00:35:26,570
No.

643
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:30,030
No, it doesn't.

644
00:35:37,982 --> 00:35:40,177
You know, Chariot,

645
00:35:40,218 --> 00:35:44,018
always wondered,

646
00:35:44,055 --> 00:35:45,818
who would win a fight
between you and me?

647
00:35:49,527 --> 00:35:51,495
First, I'm gonna take those
fucking scissors from you.

648
00:35:51,529 --> 00:35:52,757
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

649
00:35:52,797 --> 00:35:55,698
I might throw 'em down
the air duct.

650
00:35:55,733 --> 00:35:57,860
I can't wait to see that.
Ahh!

651
00:35:57,902 --> 00:35:59,494
Ha.

652
00:35:59,537 --> 00:36:01,505
Then I'm gonna beat you to death
with my bare fucking fists.

653
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:03,530
Oh!

654
00:36:03,575 --> 00:36:05,600
What's going on
with the scissors?

655
00:36:05,643 --> 00:36:07,736
Where are they?
Keep your eye on the scissors.

656
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:09,838
There they are, right there.

657
00:36:12,484 --> 00:36:15,749
All right, scratch that.

658
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:22,251
Sure you don't wanna concede?

659
00:36:22,293 --> 00:36:24,056
I guess you killed
the Devil, huh?

660
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:26,063
- I didn't kill the Devil.
- So what's this then?

661
00:36:26,097 --> 00:36:27,587
Little baby dick
grew some balls?

662
00:36:27,632 --> 00:36:30,624
Just orders, man.
Just following orders.

663
00:36:30,668 --> 00:36:32,795
Your subservience
will be the death of you.

664
00:36:37,876 --> 00:36:40,367
Hey, check this out.

665
00:36:53,858 --> 00:36:55,587
Why was the Devil killed?

666
00:36:55,627 --> 00:36:58,061
Somebody had to take responsibility
for Safe House.

667
00:36:58,096 --> 00:37:01,429
- Who killed him?
- Temperance.

668
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:03,832
Aha-ha,
sneaky little bitch.

669
00:37:19,584 --> 00:37:21,142
Ow!

670
00:37:21,185 --> 00:37:23,983
Pussy.

671
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,094
Oh, no, hang on.
Wait, wait, wait.

672
00:37:39,137 --> 00:37:41,332
Oh my God.

673
00:37:41,372 --> 00:37:43,363
What happened?

674
00:37:47,845 --> 00:37:50,177
Tower.

675
00:38:00,224 --> 00:38:02,192
- Tower.
- This heretic on our native soil.

676
00:38:02,226 --> 00:38:04,217
Tow-

677
00:38:04,262 --> 00:38:06,457
Isn't Comm closed?

678
00:38:25,183 --> 00:38:27,174
You might need those,
motherfucker. Let's go!

679
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:17,767
Get him! Get him!

680
00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:13,914
Really?

681
00:41:15,286 --> 00:41:17,049
Get the fuck off.

682
00:41:27,598 --> 00:41:30,863
I'm gonna find a way out
of here.

683
00:41:30,902 --> 00:41:33,132
Fuck.

684
00:41:37,275 --> 00:41:39,243
Do you think now
that I'm single,

685
00:41:39,277 --> 00:41:41,745
someone like Temperance
would ever date me?

686
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:44,680
Not unless you pay for it.

687
00:41:44,715 --> 00:41:46,512
Listen to this.

688
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:48,644
Woman:
Yes, my darling,

689
00:41:48,686 --> 00:41:51,154
I want you
to fuck me right now.

690
00:41:51,189 --> 00:41:53,487
The Devil:
Oh, you are a naughty girl.

691
00:41:53,524 --> 00:41:55,082
- I'm going to have to spank you.
- I told you.

692
00:41:55,126 --> 00:41:57,253
That's the Devil having
phone sex.

693
00:41:57,295 --> 00:41:59,229
Yeah,
but who's the woman?

694
00:41:59,263 --> 00:42:01,595
Woman:
Spank me, Satan.

695
00:42:01,632 --> 00:42:04,362
You look guilty.

696
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:08,136
What are you children up to?

697
00:42:08,172 --> 00:42:10,140
Just getting everything back
in order.

698
00:42:10,174 --> 00:42:12,574
Yeah-

699
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:15,738
it was out of order,

700
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:19,216
and so we're just concentrating
on trying to get it back-

701
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,775
- Back in order.
- Yeah.

702
00:42:49,447 --> 00:42:51,415
Shit! Fuck!

703
00:42:51,449 --> 00:42:53,417
Are you all right?

704
00:42:53,451 --> 00:42:56,147
You okay?

705
00:42:56,187 --> 00:42:58,781
I'm never gonna see
her face again.

706
00:42:58,823 --> 00:43:00,984
Who? Who?

707
00:43:01,025 --> 00:43:04,017
Just she was
always there for me.

708
00:43:04,061 --> 00:43:07,087
Hierophant, who?
Who was there?

709
00:43:07,131 --> 00:43:10,623
Penny. Penny.
I just wanted to say goodbye to her.

710
00:43:10,668 --> 00:43:12,761
Who's Penny, Hierophant?

711
00:43:12,803 --> 00:43:16,603
She had the most beautiful
yellow eyes you'd ever seen.

712
00:43:16,641 --> 00:43:18,506
Are you talking
about a fucking cat?

713
00:43:18,542 --> 00:43:20,669
You don't listen to me.
I'm from a small town.

714
00:43:20,711 --> 00:43:22,838
My life was not supposed
to turn out like-

715
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,713
This fucking place is gonna blow.
We need to find a way out of here.

716
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,342
Listen to me.

717
00:43:27,385 --> 00:43:29,910
- Listen to me! Listen to me!
- We've gotta get the fuck out of-

718
00:43:29,954 --> 00:43:32,286
Stay there.
Stay there.

719
00:43:35,693 --> 00:43:37,388
Ha!

720
00:43:39,397 --> 00:43:42,855
Fuck you! Fuck!

721
00:43:44,168 --> 00:43:46,227
Fuck!

722
00:43:52,043 --> 00:43:53,738
I don't think we've met.

723
00:43:58,149 --> 00:44:00,174
You think that's unworthy
of a response?

724
00:44:00,217 --> 00:44:02,481
You're the Hermit?

725
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:07,084
Okay, I see.

726
00:44:07,124 --> 00:44:08,853
Oh, I see.

727
00:44:08,893 --> 00:44:11,589
To think I was gonna come
shake your hand.

728
00:44:11,629 --> 00:44:13,688
Hierophant:
You fucker!

729
00:44:15,466 --> 00:44:17,263
Hierophant:
Oh my God!

730
00:44:21,872 --> 00:44:23,567
Shit!

731
00:44:23,607 --> 00:44:25,598
Fuck!

732
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,017
Ha.

733
00:45:11,856 --> 00:45:14,381
Ew!

734
00:45:19,697 --> 00:45:21,528
She's already fucking dead!

735
00:45:21,565 --> 00:45:24,466
Are you fucking done?
She's fucking dead!

736
00:45:24,502 --> 00:45:27,733
Are you in any way
turned on by this?

737
00:45:27,772 --> 00:45:30,764
Are you fucking kidding me?

738
00:45:30,808 --> 00:45:33,971
I know. Me, neither.

739
00:45:34,011 --> 00:45:36,946
It is gross.

740
00:45:38,482 --> 00:45:40,143
She's fucking dead!

741
00:45:40,184 --> 00:45:42,846
- Now I'm done.
- Fuck!

742
00:45:45,222 --> 00:45:48,749
Well, are you gonna come out
from under her or what?

743
00:45:48,793 --> 00:45:51,023
How the fuck do I know
you're not gonna hurt me?

744
00:45:51,062 --> 00:45:54,862
I found something.
I need your help.

745
00:45:54,899 --> 00:45:56,924
Unless it's a way out of here,
then fuck you.

746
00:45:56,967 --> 00:45:58,332
- I'm very happy here.
- Well, I think maybe.

747
00:45:58,369 --> 00:46:00,200
Oh, really?
Oh, fuck.

748
00:46:00,237 --> 00:46:03,638
Get the fuck off me,
you psycho bitch.

749
00:46:09,914 --> 00:46:12,405
How about you explain to me
what the fuck is going on.

750
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:14,179
Keep your voice down.
I will not hesitate to kill you.

751
00:46:14,218 --> 00:46:16,311
All right, fine,
but what the fuck is going on?

752
00:46:16,353 --> 00:46:18,344
You never knew
when to stop talking, did you?

753
00:46:18,389 --> 00:46:20,357
- You wanna get into it?
- No, I don't.

754
00:46:20,391 --> 00:46:21,790
Cassie, listen to me.

755
00:46:21,826 --> 00:46:23,794
Don't fucking call me that.

756
00:46:23,828 --> 00:46:25,523
You have no right
to call me that.

757
00:46:25,563 --> 00:46:27,394
You don't know me.
You don't care about me.

758
00:46:27,431 --> 00:46:29,626
- Oh, come on.
- Hey!

759
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:31,692
Let me tell you something.

760
00:46:31,735 --> 00:46:35,136
Every single moment
that I ever spent with you is over

761
00:46:35,172 --> 00:46:36,969
and done and gone.

762
00:46:37,007 --> 00:46:39,373
It's as if I read it
in a dime store novella

763
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:42,675
because honestly,
it feels like it never happened.

764
00:46:42,713 --> 00:46:45,307
It's just information.
Nothing more.

765
00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:48,045
Do you fucking understand me?

766
00:46:48,085 --> 00:46:50,053
Yeah, but you're lying.
You wanna know how I know?

767
00:46:50,087 --> 00:46:51,782
'Cause you never
broke eye contact,

768
00:46:51,822 --> 00:46:54,313
which means you really wanted me
to believe it, because if it were true,

769
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:57,384
Cassie,
you wouldn't give a fuck.

770
00:46:59,697 --> 00:47:03,428
Never address me
by my real name again.

771
00:47:05,503 --> 00:47:07,698
Because I will kill you.

772
00:47:16,647 --> 00:47:18,638
You are still hot.

773
00:48:08,832 --> 00:48:11,858
The fucking Hermit hasn't
left the bunker since election day.

774
00:48:19,877 --> 00:48:22,505
Have you thought about what happens
if we don't find a way out of here?

775
00:48:22,546 --> 00:48:24,707
What happens
is the bomb explodes.

776
00:48:24,748 --> 00:48:27,080
Well, yeah, obviously.

777
00:48:27,117 --> 00:48:29,517
- Then what's your fucking question?
- I don't know.

778
00:48:29,553 --> 00:48:31,748
God.
I don't know.

779
00:48:31,789 --> 00:48:35,589
I can't imagine
not waking up tomorrow, you know?

780
00:48:35,626 --> 00:48:38,060
I can.

781
00:48:38,095 --> 00:48:40,928
All right, well, never mind.

782
00:49:00,017 --> 00:49:03,316
Carl: Six dead so far.

783
00:49:03,354 --> 00:49:05,720
- Three from each team.
- Jesus.

784
00:49:21,038 --> 00:49:23,006
No, don't,
she's on our team!

785
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,099
Drop the fucking weapon!
Shut the fuck up!

786
00:49:25,142 --> 00:49:27,406
- She's on our fucking side.
- The fuck she is.

787
00:49:27,444 --> 00:49:29,071
I'm not here
to kill you.

788
00:49:29,113 --> 00:49:31,411
- She killed the Devil.
- No, just let me explain.

789
00:49:31,448 --> 00:49:35,248
You got 10 seconds before I put
a memo spike in your fucking brain stem.

790
00:49:35,286 --> 00:49:36,913
It's a little more complicated
than 10 seconds.

791
00:49:36,954 --> 00:49:38,922
- You better start talking then, huh?
- Okay.

792
00:49:38,956 --> 00:49:40,821
We were called in
early this morning.

793
00:49:40,858 --> 00:49:42,985
Corporate has spoken.

794
00:49:43,027 --> 00:49:47,020
The Omega Team
gets eliminated now.

795
00:49:47,064 --> 00:49:49,692
Jesus Christ,
this is just my luck.

796
00:49:49,733 --> 00:49:51,360
On my first fucking day.

797
00:49:51,402 --> 00:49:53,893
Well, there may be a reason
as to why you were called in today.

798
00:49:53,937 --> 00:49:55,427
- Like what?
- I don't know.

799
00:49:55,472 --> 00:49:58,669
I'm just saying I somehow doubt
this was all just a coincidence.

800
00:49:58,709 --> 00:50:01,542
So you knew?

801
00:50:01,578 --> 00:50:04,138
- You knew you had to kill me?
- What?

802
00:50:04,181 --> 00:50:07,150
You fucking heard me.
When we first saw each other today,

803
00:50:07,184 --> 00:50:08,446
in this office,

804
00:50:08,485 --> 00:50:10,851
did you or did you not already
know that you had to kill me?

805
00:50:10,888 --> 00:50:12,515
Who cares?
I didn't kill you.

806
00:50:12,556 --> 00:50:14,615
Answer the fucking question,
Cassie.

807
00:50:14,658 --> 00:50:17,593
- Cassie. Your name's Cassie?
- Shut up, Chariot.

808
00:50:17,628 --> 00:50:19,892
I need to know.
Did they give you a photo?

809
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:21,397
- Did you really want to know?
- Yes, I need-

810
00:50:21,432 --> 00:50:24,401
Yes!
I knew I was gonna kill you.

811
00:50:24,435 --> 00:50:27,461
I saw your picture,
and I knew I was gonna kill you.

812
00:50:27,504 --> 00:50:30,701
Let me go!

813
00:50:30,741 --> 00:50:33,574
Fuck.
That's some heavy shit, huh?

814
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:36,579
Honeymoon's over.
What about the bomb, huh?

815
00:50:36,613 --> 00:50:38,080
I didn't see that coming.

816
00:50:38,115 --> 00:50:40,106
Oh, good work.

817
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:42,948
I basically signed
my own death warrant

818
00:50:42,986 --> 00:50:44,954
when I decided
to hack up Hierophant,

819
00:50:44,988 --> 00:50:46,956
so do you think
you can take that

820
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,958
as an apology of sorts
and move on?

821
00:50:48,992 --> 00:50:50,892
- Okay.
- Okay.

822
00:50:53,297 --> 00:50:55,527
Interested in this?

823
00:50:59,436 --> 00:51:02,405
Okay.

824
00:51:02,439 --> 00:51:05,067
44 minutes.

825
00:51:05,109 --> 00:51:08,943
44 minutes,
39 seconds, 38, 37,

826
00:51:08,979 --> 00:51:10,412
36- is this helping?

827
00:51:10,447 --> 00:51:11,607
- Temperance: Shut up
- 35.

828
00:51:17,821 --> 00:51:20,415
Fool is "Eric Allen Gaines,

829
00:51:20,457 --> 00:51:23,483
born in New York,
November 3, 1976,

830
00:51:23,527 --> 00:51:24,994
of British parents,

831
00:51:25,028 --> 00:51:27,929
dual citizenship in the U.K."

832
00:51:27,965 --> 00:51:30,160
Hmm. I thought he
was hiding an accent.

833
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,065
You can tell.

834
00:51:32,102 --> 00:51:35,469
Dual citizenship?
The Factory would never hire somebody

835
00:51:35,506 --> 00:51:37,303
with dual citizenship.

836
00:51:37,341 --> 00:51:41,277
Well, they'd never do a lot
of things they're doing today.

837
00:51:41,311 --> 00:51:43,074
I am not going to get
into the vent.

838
00:51:43,113 --> 00:51:44,444
Someone went in there.

839
00:51:44,481 --> 00:51:45,948
- Probably Hermit.
- God damn it!

840
00:51:45,983 --> 00:51:49,043
If there's an exit or a way out,
he found it. Find it!

841
00:51:49,086 --> 00:51:50,849
- Fuck!
- Go ahead, go ahead.

842
00:51:50,888 --> 00:51:53,516
Now I'm gonna walk across the hall,
and I'm gonna do a body count.

843
00:51:53,557 --> 00:51:57,015
Hey, listen, why don't we just
go find a fucking way out of here?

844
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,755
Everybody's gonna die anyway.

845
00:51:58,796 --> 00:52:01,856
Oh my God. Did your mother
take a shit in your frontal lobe?

846
00:52:01,899 --> 00:52:03,867
- If Omega survives,
- What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

847
00:52:03,901 --> 00:52:06,392
and we get out,
Corporate will kill us

848
00:52:06,437 --> 00:52:08,701
by nightfall.
Get in the vent.

849
00:52:08,739 --> 00:52:11,230
- Go, disappear.
- What's the time? What time?

850
00:52:11,275 --> 00:52:13,675
You have 38 fucking minutes.

851
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:16,076
- Great, thank you so much.
- Be gone, you're still not gone.

852
00:52:16,113 --> 00:52:18,343
I can't believe
you're not fucking gone.

853
00:52:18,382 --> 00:52:20,247
- God damn it.
- Now you're gone.

854
00:52:20,284 --> 00:52:22,650
You are so fucking gone.

855
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,941
The Magician:
Hey!

856
00:52:51,982 --> 00:52:55,213
What the fuck's going on?

857
00:53:01,492 --> 00:53:04,393
What the fuck was that?

858
00:53:04,428 --> 00:53:06,794
- Letters to numbers. Letters to numbers.
- What?

859
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:09,731
"Heaven.
Heaven, Heaven. "

860
00:53:09,766 --> 00:53:12,758
Heaven equals 8-5-1-22-5-

861
00:53:12,803 --> 00:53:16,102
- Shh!
- 5 and 14.

862
00:53:16,139 --> 00:53:18,130
Temperance, go make a sweep
of the main floor.

863
00:53:18,175 --> 00:53:20,575
Find out where
that noise came from.

864
00:53:20,611 --> 00:53:23,978
- Go, now! Come on!
- Jesus.

865
00:53:24,014 --> 00:53:26,881
Kids.
No respect for authority.

866
00:53:26,917 --> 00:53:30,318
I was in Beirut,
motherfucker.

867
00:54:26,176 --> 00:54:29,009
"Never Hints"- you think
this might be the de-activation code?

868
00:54:29,046 --> 00:54:31,014
I don't know.

869
00:54:31,048 --> 00:54:33,744
My life's a wreck.

870
00:54:33,784 --> 00:54:36,014
So tired

871
00:54:36,053 --> 00:54:38,453
of this job.

872
00:54:38,488 --> 00:54:40,513
So tired.

873
00:54:42,893 --> 00:54:45,327
My name is Tony.

874
00:54:45,362 --> 00:54:48,661
I'm from Reading,
Pennsylvania.

875
00:54:50,801 --> 00:54:54,430
Was my high school
valedictorian.

876
00:54:55,472 --> 00:54:57,599
I'm an Eagle Scout.

877
00:54:59,176 --> 00:55:02,509
And now how am I supposed
to have a relationship?

878
00:55:06,049 --> 00:55:07,516
Supposed to be anonymous.

879
00:55:07,551 --> 00:55:09,985
Nice to meet you.
I'm the Chariot.

880
00:55:12,856 --> 00:55:15,086
That's why I go
to strip clubs.

881
00:55:18,762 --> 00:55:22,721
And I don't care
if die today.

882
00:55:22,766 --> 00:55:26,566
- It's okay.
- Don't you fucking touch me, Fool.

883
00:55:26,603 --> 00:55:29,538
Don't you fucking-

884
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:41,345
And I'm back.

885
00:55:55,232 --> 00:55:58,429
Temperance, my angel.

886
00:56:00,303 --> 00:56:02,931
Where have you been?

887
00:56:05,509 --> 00:56:07,602
It's getting closer.

888
00:56:23,427 --> 00:56:25,952
You want me to enter the code?

889
00:56:25,996 --> 00:56:28,226
- You sure it correlates the numbers?
- Shut up.

890
00:56:28,265 --> 00:56:30,597
- What happens if it blows?
- Shut up!

891
00:56:30,634 --> 00:56:32,397
What the fuck
do you want me to do?

892
00:56:32,436 --> 00:56:34,301
- Do you want me to enter the code-
- Enter the fucking code.

893
00:56:34,337 --> 00:56:36,100
- Okay, but what if it's wrong?
- Enter the code.

894
00:56:36,139 --> 00:56:37,504
- What if it's wrong?
- Shut the fuck up.

895
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:40,999
- Okay, fuck.
- Hey, give me that can.

896
00:56:41,044 --> 00:56:42,978
Give me that can, right there.
Right there.

897
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:50,080
Never hints. Never hints.

898
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,021
It's the same type font
as the safe.

899
00:56:53,056 --> 00:56:55,456
"Heaven,"
"Never hints. "

900
00:56:55,492 --> 00:56:57,585
Heaven never hints.

901
00:56:57,627 --> 00:56:59,891
Heaven never hints
makes sense, right?

902
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:01,898
'Cause he's the Devil.
heaven never hints.

903
00:57:01,932 --> 00:57:03,900
Fuck it. I'm just gonna do it.

904
00:57:05,836 --> 00:57:07,861
It's not my fault.
It's my first fucking day.

905
00:57:07,904 --> 00:57:10,372
They're all dead.

906
00:57:10,407 --> 00:57:12,272
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

907
00:57:12,309 --> 00:57:14,300
Would you mind telling me
where the bodies are?

908
00:57:25,489 --> 00:57:27,684
What the fuck was that?
Was that you?

909
00:57:27,724 --> 00:57:31,160
The fucking code-

910
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:35,891
What is that?

911
00:57:35,932 --> 00:57:37,297
- There's the Magician.
- Where?

912
00:57:37,334 --> 00:57:40,030
In an air vent,
over the bullpen.

913
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:42,368
Do you smell that?

914
00:58:03,426 --> 00:58:05,917
Hey, we need to go now.

915
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:12,500
Neil:
What the fuck is going on?

916
00:58:14,638 --> 00:58:16,367
Fool still alive?

917
00:58:16,406 --> 00:58:17,839
As far as we can tell.

918
00:58:19,409 --> 00:58:22,037
Has anyone been
in the Devil's safe?

919
00:58:22,078 --> 00:58:25,707
I don't know. It's hard to see
what's going on in there. It's too dark.

920
00:58:25,749 --> 00:58:28,718
Show me everything that's gone on
in the Devil's office in the last 20 minutes.

921
00:58:28,752 --> 00:58:31,050
Okay.

922
00:58:49,706 --> 00:58:53,005
Temperance?
Temperance, baby.

923
00:58:56,847 --> 00:58:59,372
- Temperance, where are you?
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

924
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:09,122
Rumor has it Empress
fucked Dick Cheney

925
00:59:09,159 --> 00:59:11,821
at a Halliburton retreat
back in 1996.

926
00:59:11,862 --> 00:59:14,990
- Ew!
- Stop saying "Ew!"

927
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:26,573
Hell is everything
beyond these walls.

928
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:29,443
I think she's suffering
from post-menopausal madness.

929
00:59:29,479 --> 00:59:32,642
You can put on makeup,
but you can't hide crazy.

930
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:03,707
Where the answer is yes,
we intend to move forward...

931
01:00:03,747 --> 01:00:06,011
Carl: All of the data's
being destroyed.

932
01:00:06,049 --> 01:00:07,573
There's nothing else
we can do.

933
01:00:07,617 --> 01:00:11,018
Those of us who manage
the public's dollars will be held to account.

934
01:00:11,054 --> 01:00:13,113
I don't care what you say.

935
01:00:13,156 --> 01:00:15,624
You can fire me if you want to.
I'm having a drink.

936
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:21,123
It's in a big black toolbox.

937
01:00:25,969 --> 01:00:27,960
Got it.

938
01:00:28,004 --> 01:00:29,801
Whoa-ho-ho-hey!

939
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:32,706
Look what daddy found,
kids.

940
01:00:32,742 --> 01:00:35,336
Got it.
Everybody relax.

941
01:00:35,378 --> 01:00:38,176
Temperance:
Come on, just focus. All right.

942
01:00:38,214 --> 01:00:40,205
Oh my God.
I missed you.

943
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:42,480
So we're right here.

944
01:00:42,519 --> 01:00:44,714
- Right, the storeroom.
- Hey, what's this door right here?

945
01:00:44,754 --> 01:00:46,722
Right here in the cooler,
you ever see that door?

946
01:00:46,756 --> 01:00:48,747
- Temperance: I don't know.
- This leads to the door.

947
01:00:48,792 --> 01:00:50,316
Yeah, well,
where does it lead?

948
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,588
The Fool: I don't know.
Doesn't say.

949
01:00:51,628 --> 01:00:53,061
- Is that an exit?
- No.

950
01:00:53,096 --> 01:00:55,758
What the fuck was that? What was that?

951
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,095
- Hey, guys, you hear that?
- I didn't hear anything.

952
01:00:59,135 --> 01:01:00,762
- No, there's something there.
- What? No one's in here.

953
01:01:00,804 --> 01:01:03,102
They would have to
come through that door.

954
01:01:03,139 --> 01:01:05,505
- Just get your shit together and go!
- There's something over there!

955
01:01:05,542 --> 01:01:08,340
There's something, man.

956
01:01:36,272 --> 01:01:38,240
Where the fuck did he go?

957
01:01:38,274 --> 01:01:40,105
Screw it.
Come on, let's go.

958
01:01:40,143 --> 01:01:42,111
- How much time do we have?
- About 19 minutes.

959
01:01:42,145 --> 01:01:45,137
- Come on, let's go, Chariot.
- I'm gonna really fuck him for that.

960
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:04,826
We must-

961
01:02:04,868 --> 01:02:07,632
and dust ourselves off
and begin again.

962
01:02:10,006 --> 01:02:11,564
Carl: Mmm!

963
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:15,700
Chariot:
What the fuck you looking at?

964
01:02:15,745 --> 01:02:18,009
These photographs I found
in the Devil's safe.

965
01:02:18,048 --> 01:02:20,448
- Temperance: Jesus!
- It's fucking Safe House,

966
01:02:20,483 --> 01:02:22,007
the reason we're
in this godforsaken mess.

967
01:02:22,052 --> 01:02:24,077
- Well, what's Safe House?
- It's a mission that got fucked

968
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,088
because of an outside hire.

969
01:02:26,122 --> 01:02:27,612
Guy tripped the wires
cracking a safe.

970
01:02:27,657 --> 01:02:30,023
Long story short,
my best man's dead.

971
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:33,655
Only solace is they chased his ass
down a city street at 4:00 in the morning.

972
01:02:33,696 --> 01:02:37,632
Shot him two inches
above his fucking heart. Hmm.

973
01:02:39,335 --> 01:02:42,793
Fucker's lucky
I started drinking again.

974
01:02:42,839 --> 01:02:44,431
What?

975
01:02:44,474 --> 01:02:46,339
Nothing. Come on.

976
01:02:46,376 --> 01:02:50,142
- Wait!
- Fuck!

977
01:02:51,314 --> 01:02:53,441
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

978
01:02:53,483 --> 01:02:55,474
Get the fuck off!

979
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:58,481
You're the outside hire?

980
01:02:58,521 --> 01:03:00,955
You?
You're the reason

981
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:03,390
we're in this fucking mess
right now?

982
01:03:03,426 --> 01:03:05,792
And that's why today
was your first day

983
01:03:05,829 --> 01:03:07,490
because they wanted-

984
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:10,624
- No, Chariot, let him go!
- No!

985
01:03:10,667 --> 01:03:13,295
No no no,
he fucked our mission!

986
01:03:13,336 --> 01:03:17,067
Not me, not Omega,
not the Devil, bullshit!

987
01:03:17,107 --> 01:03:19,007
Bullshit!
You did it on purpose.

988
01:03:19,042 --> 01:03:21,135
- You set it up.
- The fuck I did, Chariot.

989
01:03:21,177 --> 01:03:23,645
It was supposed
to be a simple crack job.

990
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,979
- Will you just fucking drop it! Who cares?
- I care!

991
01:03:27,016 --> 01:03:29,484
I fucking care.
My best fucking man

992
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:31,316
died because of him.
I care.

993
01:03:31,354 --> 01:03:34,983
And he fucking killed Strength.
You killed Strength.

994
01:03:35,024 --> 01:03:37,822
Chariot, let him go.
Drop the weapon.

995
01:03:37,861 --> 01:03:39,829
- No!
- I said

996
01:03:39,863 --> 01:03:42,423
drop the motherfucking weapon!

997
01:03:42,465 --> 01:03:46,094
- Do not sidestep your responsibility.
- Temperance: Three...

998
01:03:46,136 --> 01:03:49,663
two, one.
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

999
01:03:49,706 --> 01:03:53,164
- Okay! Fuck!
- Jesus.

1000
01:03:58,448 --> 01:04:01,212
Who hired you?

1001
01:04:01,251 --> 01:04:03,116
Who fucking hired you?

1002
01:04:06,256 --> 01:04:08,588
Oh, shit!

1003
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:11,617
Get up, let's go.

1004
01:04:23,339 --> 01:04:25,899
No, go on!
He's coming.

1005
01:04:25,942 --> 01:04:28,240
Go!

1006
01:04:28,278 --> 01:04:31,042
We gotta get
to the water cooler room.

1007
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,570
There's a secret door in there.
I'll fight him off.

1008
01:04:32,615 --> 01:04:34,879
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Just go now!

1009
01:04:37,053 --> 01:04:40,420
Ha ha, bring it on,
you short bearded faggot.

1010
01:04:44,427 --> 01:04:46,657
You know,
that really hurts my feeling

1011
01:04:46,696 --> 01:04:48,891
when you say stuff
like that.

1012
01:04:54,003 --> 01:04:56,335
Okay, what am I looking for?

1013
01:05:07,684 --> 01:05:10,676
Well, well, someone's entered
the cooler room.

1014
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:13,416
Are you looking
for something, baby?

1015
01:05:18,394 --> 01:05:20,089
I don't think so.

1016
01:05:21,464 --> 01:05:24,092
Shit.

1017
01:05:27,036 --> 01:05:29,129
What stake
do you have in this?

1018
01:05:29,172 --> 01:05:30,969
Oh, God, Temperance.

1019
01:05:31,007 --> 01:05:33,669
Does everything have to
be open for discussion here?

1020
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:35,871
Why are you siding
with Alpha, huh?

1021
01:05:35,912 --> 01:05:38,506
I don't feel well.
I have a headache.

1022
01:05:38,548 --> 01:05:41,608
I feel woozy,
and I've got a nervous stomach,

1023
01:05:41,651 --> 01:05:45,314
and my I.B.S. is kicking in,
and it's gonna look bad in this suit.

1024
01:05:45,355 --> 01:05:47,823
So please,
can we discuss this later?

1025
01:05:47,857 --> 01:05:50,985
Later? What do you mean later?
There is no later!

1026
01:05:51,027 --> 01:05:53,188
Yeah, I'd rather do things
without-

1027
01:05:53,229 --> 01:05:56,198
I'd rather do things without yelling.

1028
01:05:56,232 --> 01:05:59,030
What the fuck is wrong
with you?

1029
01:05:59,068 --> 01:06:01,366
Okay, here we go.

1030
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:04,607
This is why I don't do teams.

1031
01:06:04,641 --> 01:06:07,269
I don't have good people skills.

1032
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:09,278
I don't want-
why do we have to talk?

1033
01:06:09,312 --> 01:06:11,940
Why do we have to talk
all the time?

1034
01:06:11,981 --> 01:06:14,074
I don't have people skills!

1035
01:06:14,117 --> 01:06:16,449
You think it's easy
to look like a bearded tampon?

1036
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,911
I don't wanna do this.

1037
01:06:21,257 --> 01:06:24,454
You keep your mouth shut.
It's always about talking!

1038
01:06:24,494 --> 01:06:26,724
What are you,
Sally Jessy Raphael?

1039
01:06:35,738 --> 01:06:39,037
I'm sorry.
Did I give you a fright?

1040
01:06:45,048 --> 01:06:46,606
Honestly, I didn't mean to.

1041
01:06:46,649 --> 01:06:50,585
I mean, I do understand how
you might be a little jumpy

1042
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:54,556
in light
of the circumstances.

1043
01:07:08,905 --> 01:07:10,873
What circumstance?

1044
01:07:10,907 --> 01:07:12,738
Well, it's your first day.

1045
01:07:12,775 --> 01:07:15,209
You've witnessed a lot
of blood.

1046
01:07:15,244 --> 01:07:17,371
And now you've got,
like, what?

1047
01:07:17,413 --> 01:07:19,210
You got 10 minutes left

1048
01:07:19,248 --> 01:07:23,082
searching for safe haven,
and now I show up

1049
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:25,178
with the pretty clear intention

1050
01:07:25,221 --> 01:07:27,382
of squandering any
and all hope

1051
01:07:27,423 --> 01:07:29,550
by beating you to death

1052
01:07:29,592 --> 01:07:31,560
with a flaming putter.

1053
01:07:40,837 --> 01:07:43,465
Get your chin up.

1054
01:07:43,506 --> 01:07:45,235
Chin up.

1055
01:07:50,113 --> 01:07:52,946
That's what they used
to say to me at fat camp.

1056
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:56,418
"Get your chin up. "
You know what the counselor would say?

1057
01:07:56,452 --> 01:07:58,181
He'd say,
"Get your chins up. "

1058
01:07:58,221 --> 01:08:01,622
Get your chin up.

1059
01:08:05,795 --> 01:08:07,786
It's just...

1060
01:08:09,799 --> 01:08:12,495
Pert Plus.

1061
01:08:12,535 --> 01:08:16,198
We could have been buddies.

1062
01:08:17,407 --> 01:08:20,638
We could have been buddies!

1063
01:08:25,415 --> 01:08:28,942
Open...

1064
01:08:28,985 --> 01:08:30,612
mouth!

1065
01:08:31,687 --> 01:08:34,952
You want me
to open my mouth.

1066
01:08:36,759 --> 01:08:39,887
Gonna put some lipstick
on first.

1067
01:08:42,131 --> 01:08:45,294
- What color is it?
- Guess.

1068
01:08:46,569 --> 01:08:48,127
Red.

1069
01:08:48,171 --> 01:08:50,639
Mnh-mnh.

1070
01:08:50,673 --> 01:08:54,006
Okay, what color is it?

1071
01:08:57,447 --> 01:09:01,247
The color of your dick

1072
01:09:01,284 --> 01:09:04,412
after this bullet goes in you.

1073
01:09:06,722 --> 01:09:08,314
God damn it!

1074
01:09:10,693 --> 01:09:12,217
Not again.

1075
01:09:12,261 --> 01:09:15,628
The Devil: Oh, my darling,
I'm so afraid I will never live

1076
01:09:15,665 --> 01:09:19,328
- to see your face.
- Woman: Be still, my dear Satan.

1077
01:09:19,368 --> 01:09:21,336
There must be a layout
of your dungeon.

1078
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:24,396
- We can find a way out together.
- No!

1079
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:27,568
There is no escaping this place.

1080
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:30,101
Oh, my penis!

1081
01:09:30,146 --> 01:09:32,740
- Where's the exit door?
- You shot me right in the shaft!

1082
01:09:32,782 --> 01:09:34,682
- Where's the exit door?
- I don't know.

1083
01:09:34,717 --> 01:09:36,947
Don't bullshit me, Hermit.
I know you know where the exit door is.

1084
01:09:36,986 --> 01:09:39,216
You would have never been
as cool as you were.

1085
01:09:39,255 --> 01:09:41,382
Where is it?

1086
01:09:41,424 --> 01:09:43,358
I- I- I don't know.

1087
01:09:43,392 --> 01:09:46,987
God! Jesus, Temperance!

1088
01:09:47,029 --> 01:09:50,487
Where's the exit door, Hermit?

1089
01:09:50,533 --> 01:09:52,660
It's- it's-

1090
01:09:52,702 --> 01:09:54,693
It's on a button.
There's a button.

1091
01:09:54,737 --> 01:09:56,762
Yeah, where's the button,
Hermit?

1092
01:09:56,806 --> 01:09:59,206
Under the water cooler,
Temperance.

1093
01:09:59,242 --> 01:10:00,732
You need to listen to me.

1094
01:10:00,776 --> 01:10:03,609
I am so not listening to you,
Fool.

1095
01:10:03,646 --> 01:10:06,911
You have no idea how
to get out of here.

1096
01:10:06,949 --> 01:10:10,316
So I may as well spend the next
four and a half minutes staring

1097
01:10:10,353 --> 01:10:14,050
into your dreamy blue eyes
while I watch you die.

1098
01:10:15,958 --> 01:10:17,926
Make sense, no?

1099
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,053
Look, under the water cooler!

1100
01:10:35,177 --> 01:10:38,169
Woman:
You must trust me, Satan.

1101
01:10:52,562 --> 01:10:54,530
Temperance: Only one of us is
gonna make it out of here alive.

1102
01:10:54,564 --> 01:10:56,532
Well, I sure hope the afterlife

1103
01:10:56,566 --> 01:10:58,659
lives up to your standards.

1104
01:10:58,701 --> 01:11:01,226
Shit.

1105
01:11:03,673 --> 01:11:07,370
This is so distressing.
We have a connection.

1106
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:09,344
You look up to me, sweetie.

1107
01:11:09,378 --> 01:11:12,609
Why the fuck would I look up
to a vile cunt like you?

1108
01:11:12,648 --> 01:11:16,641
Aghh! Horribly offensive thing
to say to another woman.

1109
01:11:16,686 --> 01:11:20,679
No shit.

1110
01:11:20,723 --> 01:11:23,658
Shit, shit, shit.

1111
01:11:23,693 --> 01:11:26,719
Woman:
Confess your sins to me.

1112
01:11:26,762 --> 01:11:29,230
Heaven never hints.
Heaven never hints.

1113
01:11:41,911 --> 01:11:43,003
Shit.

1114
01:11:54,523 --> 01:11:56,514
Come on.

1115
01:12:02,765 --> 01:12:05,393
Woman: I will lead us
to paradise.

1116
01:13:06,328 --> 01:13:09,263
Okay, I've extracted
the entire audio file

1117
01:13:09,298 --> 01:13:12,233
- that caused the shutdown.
- More phone sex?

1118
01:13:12,268 --> 01:13:14,828
It's a voicemail the Devil left
just before he was killed.

1119
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:17,430
9:46 a. m.

1120
01:13:17,473 --> 01:13:19,441
The Devil:
If you are listening to this recording,

1121
01:13:19,475 --> 01:13:21,568
it is in all likelihood
that I am dead.

1122
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:23,669
Project Endgame
has been executed,

1123
01:13:23,713 --> 01:13:26,978
and Barack Obama has taken
office as the 44th president

1124
01:13:27,016 --> 01:13:28,984
of our glorious nation.

1125
01:13:29,018 --> 01:13:31,418
It is regrettable that
the dedicated men and women

1126
01:13:31,454 --> 01:13:34,912
of The Factory
had to burn in this charade.

1127
01:13:34,957 --> 01:13:38,723
Hopefully, the salvation of these
files will expose all our misdeeds.

1128
01:13:38,761 --> 01:13:41,821
to the light of day
and begin the healing process

1129
01:13:41,864 --> 01:13:45,061
towards restoring
the clandestine services

1130
01:13:45,101 --> 01:13:46,966
to their full glory.

1131
01:13:47,002 --> 01:13:50,369
Onward and upward we go.

1132
01:13:50,406 --> 01:13:53,967
And farewell,

1133
01:13:54,009 --> 01:13:56,978
my beloved Susan.

1134
01:13:58,981 --> 01:14:01,506
"My beloved Susan"?

1135
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:03,142
It was you.

1136
01:14:03,185 --> 01:14:06,211
You were having phone sex
with the Devil.

1137
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:11,413
We were lovers

1138
01:15:11,453 --> 01:15:12,920
of New Age-

1139
01:15:12,955 --> 01:15:16,391
an age of technology
and wonder,

1140
01:15:16,425 --> 01:15:20,122
an age of sexual freedom
and tolerance,

1141
01:15:20,162 --> 01:15:22,426
an advanced middle age.

1142
01:15:22,464 --> 01:15:25,024
Yeah.

1143
01:15:25,067 --> 01:15:28,366
The intimacy of two lovers

1144
01:15:28,404 --> 01:15:30,372
can be whispered across

1145
01:15:30,406 --> 01:15:32,738
the soft fiberoptic

1146
01:15:32,775 --> 01:15:34,800
channels of the heart.

1147
01:15:37,112 --> 01:15:40,741
This is our moral reparation.

1148
01:15:40,783 --> 01:15:42,808
You brought the Fool here
to retrieve the files

1149
01:15:42,852 --> 01:15:45,377
before they're all destroyed.

1150
01:15:46,922 --> 01:15:49,413
What's on the disc, Susan?

1151
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,321
It's a greatest hits package.

1152
01:15:55,364 --> 01:15:58,856
Everything they don't want
the new administration to know about.

1153
01:16:12,581 --> 01:16:15,414
- Yes.
- Susan, it's me.

1154
01:16:15,451 --> 01:16:17,476
Do you have the disc?

1155
01:16:17,519 --> 01:16:20,420
Yes, Mom, every single one
of their fuckups right here.

1156
01:16:20,456 --> 01:16:23,289
There's a cab waiting
for you on Figueroa

1157
01:16:23,325 --> 01:16:26,317
and a first class ticket
at the airport. Good luck.

1158
01:16:26,362 --> 01:16:28,523
And Godspeed.

1159
01:16:35,237 --> 01:16:38,468
I'm sorry, Carl.

1160
01:16:38,507 --> 01:16:40,532
No!

1161
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:47,640
And more united. We cannot help
but believe the old hatreds

1162
01:16:47,683 --> 01:16:49,412
shall someday pass.

1163
01:16:49,451 --> 01:16:52,648
That the lines of tribes
shall soon dissolve,

1164
01:16:52,688 --> 01:16:54,019
that as the world grows smaller,

1165
01:16:54,056 --> 01:16:56,217
our common humanity
shall reveal itself

1166
01:16:56,258 --> 01:16:58,749
and that America
must play its role

1167
01:16:58,794 --> 01:17:00,785
in ushering in a new era
of peace.

1168
01:17:55,551 --> 01:17:58,315
# No, I'm not running #

1169
01:17:58,354 --> 01:18:01,118
# But this time
I won't back down #

1170
01:18:01,156 --> 01:18:03,681
# I'm ready
for a fight now #

1171
01:18:03,726 --> 01:18:07,253
# And I'm gonna burn
this whole place down #

1172
01:18:07,296 --> 01:18:09,264
# I'm not running #

1173
01:18:09,298 --> 01:18:12,199
# But this time
I won't back down #

1174
01:18:12,234 --> 01:18:14,327
# I'm ready
for a fight now #

1175
01:18:14,370 --> 01:18:18,363
# And I'm gonna burn
this whole world down #

1176
01:18:29,852 --> 01:18:33,845
# I'm told you
you'll never stop me #

1177
01:18:35,524 --> 01:18:39,153
# But now I just stand still #

1178
01:18:41,163 --> 01:18:44,860
# I tried to hold on
to fame #

1179
01:18:46,301 --> 01:18:48,826
# But now I need #

1180
01:18:48,871 --> 01:18:50,896
# To kill #

1181
01:18:50,939 --> 01:18:53,373
# No, I'm not running #

1182
01:18:53,409 --> 01:18:56,310
# But this time
I won't back down #

1183
01:18:56,345 --> 01:18:58,870
# I'm ready
for a fight now #

1184
01:18:58,914 --> 01:19:02,748
# And I'm gonna burn
this whole place down... #

1185
01:19:02,785 --> 01:19:05,811
Hey, Corporate,

1186
01:19:05,854 --> 01:19:08,982
how are you?

1187
01:19:09,024 --> 01:19:11,288
I just wanted to say thank you
for the Christmas card this year

1188
01:19:11,326 --> 01:19:14,784
and for the bottle of wine.
So nice.

1189
01:19:14,830 --> 01:19:17,697
This is Emperor.

1190
01:19:17,733 --> 01:19:20,793
Someone initiated Project Endgame
so if this line is still working,

1191
01:19:20,836 --> 01:19:22,531
it won't be for long.

1192
01:19:22,571 --> 01:19:25,972
In life, I haven't been too big
on personal relationships,

1193
01:19:26,008 --> 01:19:28,670
but I do have some business
to attend to.

1194
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:30,439
So just a-

1195
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:33,346
just a quick note.

1196
01:19:33,382 --> 01:19:36,681
I'm gonna come back
from the dead.

1197
01:19:36,718 --> 01:19:40,176
I'm gonna eat
your fucking hearts.

1198
01:19:40,222 --> 01:19:43,680
To the widows of the many men
who I murdered,

1199
01:19:43,725 --> 01:19:46,353
I leave my entire wine collection,

1200
01:19:46,395 --> 01:19:49,387
one bottle of Lafitte, 1802.

1201
01:19:49,431 --> 01:19:52,025
Ladies, you'll just
have to split that.

1202
01:19:52,067 --> 01:19:53,762
I'm gonna find you,

1203
01:19:53,802 --> 01:19:57,067
and I'm gonna
corral you together

1204
01:19:57,106 --> 01:19:59,040
and one-by-one,

1205
01:19:59,074 --> 01:20:01,304
I'm going to slowly

1206
01:20:01,343 --> 01:20:03,038
eat your hearts

1207
01:20:03,078 --> 01:20:05,376
throughout eternity.

1208
01:20:05,414 --> 01:20:07,279
To my dog in Belgium,

1209
01:20:07,316 --> 01:20:09,511
I leave my chalet in Gdansk.

1210
01:20:09,551 --> 01:20:11,712
And then I'm gonna haunt
your families.

1211
01:20:11,753 --> 01:20:15,018
I'm gonna haunt your families.

1212
01:20:15,057 --> 01:20:18,083
I'm not talking about
just like a "boo!"

1213
01:20:18,127 --> 01:20:21,654
I'm gonna be
a really fucking creepy ghost.

1214
01:20:21,697 --> 01:20:24,461
I'm gonna be a real
evil bastard.

1215
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:27,765
And I can't wait actually.

1216
01:20:27,803 --> 01:20:31,534
I wish there was less time

1217
01:20:31,573 --> 01:20:33,905
for the bomb to go off.
I can't wait.

1218
01:20:33,942 --> 01:20:37,901
Oh, someone please return
all the books I checked out

1219
01:20:37,946 --> 01:20:40,278
of the public library in Iran.

1220
01:20:40,315 --> 01:20:43,910
I don't want them
coming after me.
