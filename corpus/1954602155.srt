00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:11,729
##

2
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,543
<i>Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

3
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:39,089
<i>We have just landed at Queen Alia
International Airport in Amman.</i>

4
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:43,385
<i>The outside temperature 38 degrees
Celsius which is equivalent to...</i>

5
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:45,470
<i>Hi, you've reached Ziad.</i>

6
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,066
<i>Leave me a message,
I'll call you back.</i>

7
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,183
Hey, it's me, I'm here,
missing you already.

8
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:52,970
<i>New York.!</i>

9
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,896
Course, there was an empty
seat next to me on the plane,

10
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,521
so I thought about you
the entire flight.

11
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,193
I'm about to go meet my
mom and sisters so...

12
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:01,987
I'll let you know what happens.

13
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,735
Call me when you can.

14
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:05,817
I love you.

15
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,568
Bye.

16
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,234
##

17
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:29,799
May!

18
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,178
Hi!

19
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,264
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

20
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:37,814
- Hi.
- Hi.

21
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:38,936
I missed you.

22
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,017
I missed you, too.

23
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,352
. Okay, okay.

24
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,187
Can you share?

25
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:45,989
Hi, what's going on?

26
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,067
Ziad didn't come...

27
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,535
Oh, it's all... no,
it's good, actually.

28
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:53,197
He had to teach, but, um, he's
gonna be here in a few weeks.

29
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,284
And it's actually better this way because
we'll get more time on our honeymoon.

30
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,618
Hmm.

31
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,494
Where's Mom?

32
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:00,750
She's cooking for you.

33
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,627
You didn't tell her that he
changed his plans, did you?

34
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:03,958
No, I didn't.

35
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,675
Is this it'?

36
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:06,798
Can I see it?

37
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,470
- Can we wait till we get...
- No, I wanna see it now.

38
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,513
Okay, okay, okay...
Just be careful.

39
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,136
- Tah-dah.
- I love it.

40
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,808
- You like it?
- It's really nice.

41
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,886
Yeah, I never thought
I'd go so conventional

42
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,471
but, you know, it
fits the wedding...

43
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,648
- I can't wait to see it on you.
- It's very simple.

44
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,066
Okay, can we get
to the reception?

45
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,984
Don't tell me you're
bored, you just got here.

46
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,609
What were we thinking coming a
whole month before the wedding.

47
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,064
We haven't all been
here together in years.

48
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,273
I know, I keep telling her.

49
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,917
Dalia thinks that just because she
loves it here, I have to, too.

50
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:31,943
- I never said that.
- That's not how it works.

51
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,574
And even if I did, there's
nothing wrong with it.

52
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,452
- It's a part of me.
- Oh, my God, congratulations.

53
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,874
- On what?
- You got your certification.

54
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,244
- I'm so proud of you.
- No, I didn't.

55
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,204
You know, massage wasn't for me.

56
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,727
Touching people's
bodies all the time

57
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:47,092
and I was absorbing all of
their bad energy, it was so...

58
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,760
But you were almost
done, weren't you?

59
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,133
- Yeah, but, it's...
- Hold that, hold that.

60
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:54,308
I could go back if I want to.

61
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:57,387
Maybe I'll move here or
someplace, you know like...

62
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,139
So, yeah.

63
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,850
Wow.

64
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,110
- That's you?
- Yeah.

65
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,563
It's gotten bad.

66
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,195
I thought she'd try to
convert me this morning.

67
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,995
Yeah, didn't work,
though did it?

68
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,072
What does that mean?

69
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,372
Honestly, you can't
blame her, though.

70
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,542
I'm sorry, there weren't
this many ninjas growing up.

71
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,178
You shouldn't call
them ninjas, Yasmine.

72
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,963
- Dalia, in your face, look.
- Don't... stop pointing.

73
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,212
I'm sorry, if my mom dressed like
that, I would be terrified of her.

74
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,964
You're just...
you're, you're rude.

75
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,216
So what, um, why
were you laid off?

76
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,421
What happened exactly?

77
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:34,677
It wasn't just me.

78
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,758
It was whole round of people.

79
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,771
Some of them had been there for 20 years...
it was really, really terrible.

80
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,231
But what about you?

81
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,310
Yalla, tell us things,
come on, how's it going?

82
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,441
- It's going well.
- Yeah?

83
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,524
Ziad's mom's... been amazing.

84
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,279
She's planned all of it.

85
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,110
Does that annoy you?

86
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,413
No, not at all, she
consults me on all points.

87
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,660
That's great.

88
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,492
I forgot, what does
Ziad teach again?

89
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,918
Contemporary Islamic
Civilization.

90
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,207
Um-hmm.. Important.

91
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,082
I think so.

92
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,556
Mom?

93
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,603
Oh, my God, it smells so good!

94
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,648
Your favorite.

95
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,525
Hi, Mom.

96
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,860
Come here, May.

97
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,288
How are you?

98
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,619
I'm good, I missed you.

99
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,166
Me too,.

100
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,834
Wow, I'm so glad you're here.

101
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,503
Me too, you look great.

102
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,885
Oh, it's all good.

103
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:55,629
How was your flight?

104
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,055
It was... you know.

105
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,765
I ate, I slept.

106
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,139
I froze my butt off.

107
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,012
You look pale.

108
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,813
Your eyes are red.

109
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,274
Do you want a nap before
everybody gets here?

110
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,317
I will never fall asleep.

111
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,065
Why do I keep forgetting?

112
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,446
You're exactly like me.

113
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,490
You can't even nap.

114
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,282
I know, me too.

115
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,709
Who's all coming over?

116
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,790
Hmm.

117
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,510
This is great, no, but I
would love some coffee.

118
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,766
- Amazing.
- Oh, I would love some, too.

119
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,770
Did I tell you guys that my
paperback is finally coming out?

120
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,101
That's great.

121
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,269
- Some time this fall.
- That's amazing.

122
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,608
I'm so proud of you.

123
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,108
Thank you.

124
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,696
- Really?
- Hmm.

125
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,156
They can't wait to meet you.

126
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,284
That's so nice.

127
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:17,920
So...

128
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,721
Everything else is okay?

129
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,257
Yeah.

130
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,340
It's good.

131
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,721
Are you sure?

132
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,052
Yeah.

133
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,514
I got worried when I heard
Ziad wasn't coming.

134
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,142
Never mind how I find out.

135
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:33,727
I felt it.

136
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,562
I felt that you were
having some problems.

137
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,988
I swear to you.

138
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,155
I told you, May.

139
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,576
Marrying outside your religion,
your culture, it's all the same.

140
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,449
It never works.

141
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,201
We're better than ever, Mom.

142
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,449
We're getting married.

143
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,003
- I just thought...
- He was just delayed.

144
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,756
He'll be here in a few weeks.

145
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,799
Don't worry, I know you're
not coming to the wedding.

146
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,130
Of course not.

147
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,644
What did we talk about?

148
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:13,976
What?

149
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,729
Have you talked to dad?

150
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,699
And why do you call him that?

151
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,321
What am I supposed to call him?

152
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,572
Anything but that.

153
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,700
It's been almost ten years, Mom.

154
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:26,826
He had a heart attack.

155
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,532
It barely qualified
for a heart attack.

156
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,037
Even the doctors say so.

157
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,665
He invented the whole thing
just to get attention.

158
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,872
Still, when I found
out, I called him.

159
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,548
And you know why?

160
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,466
Because I am better than him.

161
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,701
You shouldn't have done that.

162
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,006
I mean, he made you
miserable for years.

163
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,338
20 years.

164
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,931
As if his affairs weren't
enough humiliating,

165
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,849
he went and he married
a woman half his age.

166
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,222
She's not half his age.

167
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,554
May, she is your age, okay?

168
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,486
Are you going to see him?

169
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,812
- No
- Maybe.

170
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,331
You could've warned me.

171
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,917
I asked you not to tell her.

172
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,712
She said something already?

173
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,414
You're surprised?

174
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,379
I'm sorry.

175
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,921
I forgot.

176
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,257
Hmm.

177
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:30,018
And I... I didn't think
it was a big deal.

178
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,250
Can we clear some of your clothes
so I can have some room?

179
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,648
They're silk, they
need to be hung.

180
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,721
Issam!

181
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,845
How do they know that it
hasn't already been opened?

182
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,001
Hi, my love.

183
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,133
I wanted to tell you
about my fun-filled day.

184
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:32,887
Well, first, my mom confirmed
she's not coming to the wedding.

185
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,765
You know, in case
we had any doubt.

186
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:40,475
And... then my cousin in
front of the whole family

187
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,230
announced I'm going to hell.

188
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,404
Ah, but you'll be there too, so
don't worry, we'll rot together.

189
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,402
That's something to
look forward to.

190
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,733
<i>Hello?</i>

191
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,402
Auntie?

192
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,735
<i>May?</i>

193
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,492
I'm... I'm on the phone.

194
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,245
I am here, I'm on the phone.

195
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,044
Can you please hang up?

196
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,543
<i>I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, okay, okay.</i>

197
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,179
Oh, my God, see what it's like?

198
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,976
Oh, my God, okay, I'm
gonna go to bed now.

199
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:20,351
Um, call me tomorrow, please.

200
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,766
<i>Okay.</i>

201
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,268
I love you.

202
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:24,975
##

203
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,011
No.

204
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,015
Mom!

205
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,067
Hello?

206
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,321
Hello? Ziad?

207
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,617
Shit... Hello?

208
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,499
Oh, my God, why do
I never have...

209
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,297
Z, are you there?

210
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:30,546
Ziad, let me call you back, if you can
hear me, I'll call you back, okay?

211
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,298
This traffic is ridiculous.

212
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,800
Shit.

213
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,738
On, my God.

214
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:52,985
Wow.

215
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,700
- Is it too much?
- No.

216
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,120
Oh, my God, you
look so beautiful.

217
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,656
On.

218
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,582
Get over here.

219
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:09,047
Mom is totally gonna regret not
being here for this moment.

220
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,795
She might still come around.

221
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,834
Yeah, right.

222
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,678
Uh...

223
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:31,395
When can we, uh, go
shopping for our dresses?

224
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,987
I don't wanna wear a dress.

225
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,360
Hello? Dalia, you
have to wear a dress.

226
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,158
- Uh, no, I don't.
- May, tell her.

227
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,359
May, do I have to wear a dress?

228
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,696
- She has... tell her.
- You can wear whatever you want.

229
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,156
- Exactly.
- No, she has to wear a dress.

230
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,319
That's what people do at
weddings, it won't kill you.

231
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,372
Oh, is it your wedding?

232
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,491
No, it's not your wedding.

233
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,582
No one wants to marry you.

234
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,459
It's May's wedding and she said
I could wear whatever I want.

235
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,664
Fine, whatever?

236
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,421
Yasmine, can you grab
my phone, please?

237
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,500
<i>Uh, yeah, where is it?</i>

238
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:55,631
It's in... ifs in
the dressing room.

239
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,462
No, I got it, stay
right where you are.

240
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,546
In your bag?

241
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,631
Yeah, yeah, in my purse.

242
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,137
Here.

243
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,804
Thank you, thank you.

244
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,890
Oh, my God, on, my God.

245
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,058
Finally.

246
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,233
<i>I know.</i>

247
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,561
- <i>My God,</i> we <i>speak.</i>
- <i>Can you believe it?</i>

248
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,066
No, why does it
gotta be so hard?

249
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,023
- I miss you.
- <i>I miss you, too.</i>

250
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,779
- How are you?
- I'm good.

251
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,152
I'm at-I'm at my fitting.

252
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:22,829
I'm actually wearing my dress.

253
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,156
<i>Nice.</i>

254
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,699
<i>How do you look?</i>

255
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,126
<i>I mean, is it okay to ask?</i>

256
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,370
- Um...
- <i>It's not unlucky or anything.</i>

257
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,539
No.

258
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,797
It's weird, I don't... you know,
I don't feel like myself.

259
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,806
<i>Oh, of course, you know,
that makes sense.</i>

260
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,259
What do you mean it makes sense?

261
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,765
<i>Well, you said, you weren't sure
you wanted to go through with it.</i>

262
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,973
<i>So it makes</i> sense <i>that you wouldn't
feel comfortable in your dress.</i>

263
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,275
May, Issam wants to
take us out tonight.

264
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,023
Oh, come on, come on.

265
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,319
Um, Ziad, hang on one second.

266
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,272
- Yeah, okay.
- That's great, you should go.

267
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,698
No, all of us.

268
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,775
Cool, yeah, I'll be right back.

269
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,747
Ziad, I freaked out.

270
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,998
I'm sorry, it was the planning,
it was the book tour.

271
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,876
It was... it was
all of it at once.

272
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,207
I got scared.

273
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,297
- <i>Okay, I</i> mean...
- I love you so much.

274
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:22,301
Can we please just chalk this
up to some pre-wedding cliché

275
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,382
and get on with our lives?

276
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,843
<i>Yeah.</i>

277
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,896
<i>Yeah, that's what we're
doing, but okay.</i>

278
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:33,646
Okay, but you haven't called me since I...
I got here.

279
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,069
<i>You were with your
family, you needed time.</i>

280
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,193
Why do you always think
you know what I need?

281
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,617
<i>Because I know you, May,
better than you know yourself.</i>

282
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,862
Yeah... Well, if that were
true, you'd be here right now.

283
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,071
<i>We talked about this.</i>

284
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,578
<i>We agreed I should</i> teach
<i>and you said it was okay.</i>

285
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,580
Of course, I said it was okay,
what else was I gonna say?

286
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,457
<i>Well, how about what you meant?</i>

287
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,881
<i>That would be a start and
it would be helpful.</i>

288
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,925
May?

289
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,343
May, can we go?

290
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,300
I have to get back out there.

291
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,006
Can I call you back later?

292
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,341
<i>Sure.</i>

293
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,180
This is awesome.

294
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,320
Oh, God, my body is like
physically rejecting this place.

295
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,024
I'm gonna... I'll-I'll
see you later.

296
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,462
I didn't think I'd see
you till the wedding.

297
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,536
I moved back.

298
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,746
What happened to Paris?

299
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,251
I'll go back one day.

300
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,611
I'm working with my brother now.

301
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,838
No way, we're all together?

302
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,261
Just like old times.

303
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,138
Where did Dalia go?

304
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,509
Her body didn't like the place.

305
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,927
- Yalla, cheers.
- Cheers.

306
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,596
Cheers?

307
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:56,809
##

308
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,139
- Oh, shit.
- Oh.

309
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,472
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

310
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,313
Can I bum one?

311
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,723
Yeah.

312
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,480
Thank you.

313
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,159
Oh, my God, that's disgusting.

314
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,115
Take it away.

315
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,372
Why'd you give me that?

316
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,707
You asked for it.

317
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,709
Oh, shit, I feel nauseous.

318
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,759
- Oh...
- Okay, okay.

319
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,336
Oh, my God,
everything's spinning.

320
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,841
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

321
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,390
Okay, just-ooh, take it easy.

322
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,466
Can you walk with me?

323
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,802
- Mmm.
- Yeah?

324
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:18,849
Okay, just, oh, no, no,
no, that way, yeah.

325
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,604
Okay, sit on the hood.

326
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,686
Okay, okay.

327
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,949
Whoa, whoa, whoa, just wake up,
wake up, open your eyes, okay?

328
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,276
Hey, okay.

329
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,579
What are you doing?

330
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,740
What? You were about to faint.

331
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,451
- No, I wasn't.
- Yeah, you were.

332
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,673
You don't know me.

333
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:48,260
Yeah... well, you needed help so
I was just trying to be nice.

334
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,723
You can't be nice to
people you don't know.

335
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,391
Whoa... uh... okay, boss.

336
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,519
Can I sit here?

337
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,104
- Yeah?
- I don't care.

338
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,067
Just tell me something
about yourself.

339
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:06,896
I'm drunk.

340
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,323
"I'm drunk," yeah,
okay, I gathered that.

341
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,942
On.

342
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,112
I don't know where
my sisters went.

343
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:17,495
Oh, God, so drunk and lost.

344
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,825
2

345
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,495
I'm May.

346
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,914
I'm Karim.

347
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,582
Karim.

348
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,839
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

349
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,511
Where are you from?

350
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,510
I live in New York.

351
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,633
Nice, New York, I love it.

352
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,185
You're May, yeah?

353
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,013
Yeah, I'm May.

354
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,104
You're-you're, you're
Issam's cousin, May?

355
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,814
Yeah, you're the one who wrote that
book about the Proverbs and... yeah?

356
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,033
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's you.

357
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,035
I love that book.

358
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:56,075
- Really?
- I love it, yeah.

359
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,033
You're here to get married
or something like that?

360
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,377
How'd you do that?

361
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,213
Oh, Amman's not
that big, you know.

362
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,086
There you are!

363
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,004
We're gonna go, um, get the car.

364
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,016
That is my sister.

365
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,269
So you're not that
lost after all.

366
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,483
I got something I
wanna give you, okay?

367
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,813
This is not for you so don't
take it the wrong way.

368
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,897
This is for your wedding guests.

369
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,279
In case they felt adventurous.

370
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,448
You do tours?

371
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:39,497
Yup, like hiking,
scuba diving and...

372
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,249
four-wheeling in the desert.

373
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,245
- Cool.
- Yeah.

374
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,754
Have some water
when you get home.

375
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:51,834
Okay?

376
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,169
- Yeah.
- Okay.

377
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,879
Bye-bye! May'

378
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,548
- Bye.
- Bye.

379
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,850
- Hey.
- Where have you been?

380
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,021
Falafel place.

381
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,144
Had enough fun in there?

382
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,270
Can I have some.

383
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,441
Yeah.

384
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,769
Whoa, big bite.

385
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:11,888
Oh, wow, you're pretty drunk.

386
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,194
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

387
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,274
No, I'm not.

388
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,236
##

389
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,337
##

390
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,460
What are you doing up?

391
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,717
- I couldn't sleep.
- Me neither.

392
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,719
I thought you'd be sleeping in.

393
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,472
No such luck.

394
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:07,869
1J1 a

395
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,704
What?

396
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,177
Oh, nothing, it's silly.

397
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,590
What for?

398
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,721
I'm supposed to untie it.

399
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:24,636
But it's impossible.

400
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,977
You know Aunt Hanan
with her crazy ideas.

401
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,242
It kind of binds it altogether,
it's like a theme.

402
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,413
Binds it altogether.

403
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,661
It's really essential
to have a theme.

404
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,742
Why did she come with us?

405
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,416
I didn't tell her we were
going dress shopping.

406
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,496
Yasmine?

407
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,878
She has to be here, May,
she's gotta get used to it.

408
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:58,211
Let's keep in mind, I'm
looking for a nice pant suit.

409
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,716
You can drop the
pant suit, please.

410
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:00,796
That sounds wrong.

411
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,080
There's no getting used to it.

412
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,716
She's praying we break up.

413
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:04,800
No.

414
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,512
This morning, I caught her
untying this huge knot.

415
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:10,269
I swear to God, it's some kind
of freaky breakup voodoo.

416
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,691
When are we planning
your bachelorette party.

417
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,106
How about... never.

418
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,983
How about, that's not an option.

419
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,817
How about no scavenger hunts
or stripper telegrams.

420
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,076
Do they have strippers here?

421
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,620
Let's not find out.

422
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:27,824
May, was it a knotted rope?

423
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,124
Yeah... why?

424
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,667
What if we take you to Hammam.

425
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,963
- Or we could go to the Dead Sea, huh?
- That sounds nice.

426
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:38,635
They say that if you untie
two pieces of knotted rope,

427
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:41,713
you're trying to break the
bond between two people.

428
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,674
Who says that?

429
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,636
I don't remember, but
it's some kind of spell.

430
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:57,020
She's got too much
time on her hands.

431
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:01,153
Do you think she'd ever
consider getting remarried?

432
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,942
- No.
- No.

433
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,746
Do you think May
would like this?

434
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,543
Are you kidding, that's trashy.

435
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,872
- I don't think so.
- No, it's too sexual.

436
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,375
What are you guys
whispering about?

437
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,675
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

438
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,003
No secrets.

439
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,592
I'm the bride, you have
to tell me everything.

440
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:25,924
. Okay-

441
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,685
Mom, you ever think about
getting remarried?

442
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,603
Why, I'm already married.

443
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,556
- Please don't say to God.
- Why not?

444
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,312
- Oh, Jesus.
- Him too.

445
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,236
And don't you poke fun just
because you have no faith.

446
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,654
Who says I don't have any faith.

447
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,821
I have so much faith.

448
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,491
Mom, I hate to break it to you, but
you married another lousy husband.

449
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,658
He's never around.

450
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,370
You can't see Him.

451
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,740
But He's here.

452
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,700
Everywhere.

453
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,377
That's right, I
forgot, He's a ghost.

454
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:58,956
Why is it so difficult for
you to respect my beliefs?

455
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,919
You're throwing a fit over my wedding
and you wanna talk to me about respect?

456
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:06,006
May, you don't know what
you're getting yourself into.

457
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,933
Your kids will automatically
considered Muslims, do you know that?

458
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,596
Do you know that if you divorce, you
will never have the right over them?

459
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,353
- We live in the U.S., Mom.
- So what!

460
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,392
He's from here, okay?

461
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,069
Well, then, I guess, I should just
maybe think about converting to Islam

462
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,451
because I'll have
more fights that way.

463
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,614
He's not even practicing,
he's secular.

464
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,997
You don't have to listen to
me if you don't want to.

465
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,205
But I think I have more experience
in the matter than you do.

466
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,961
Mom, you married
the imperialist.

467
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:44,881
And just because your marriage
crumbled, doesn't mean mine will.

468
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,962
Let's say God doesn't exist.

469
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:52,143
Do you think you would ever
consider remarrying a human being?

470
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,225
Even if I do, and it's a big if,

471
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,979
where in the world I'll
find someone at my age?

472
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,360
Mom, you're still young.

473
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:03,779
You don't look anything
like your age.

474
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,861
Plus, we can help, right?

475
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:08,200
Don't look at me.

476
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,911
Aren't there any single
guys at your church?

477
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,829
I don't go around asking them.

478
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,498
I can ask them.

479
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:21,706
. Maybe-

480
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,545
Okay...

481
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:28,463
I'm good, thanks.

482
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:29,838
I'll come.

483
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:30,923
Really?

484
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,849
Yes, but only because
I'm curious.

485
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:36,475
And I'm only gonna go to find you a
husband so don't get your hopes up.

486
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,896
Find me a husband.

487
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:41,150
And find Jesus at the same time.

488
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,240
##

489
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:49,918
##

490
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:45,933
I don't wanna do it.

491
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:49,020
Come on.

492
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,154
You can't just wait out
here, you'll roast.

493
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,482
I'm fine.

494
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,775
Dalia, get out of the car.

495
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,654
Open the door.

496
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,072
No.

497
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,417
Come on, he called
like six times.

498
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:05,745
He wants to see us.

499
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,706
Good for him, let's give him an
award, he remembered that we exist.

500
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,541
He had a heart attack, Dalia.

501
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:11,921
Just because he has a
re-awakened conscience,

502
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,844
it doesn't mean that I am
obligated to forgive him.

503
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,173
No one is asking you
to forgive him.

504
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:21,261
No, but it's even worse, you're
asking me to meet his whore.

505
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:22,978
Here they are.

506
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:25,727
Oh, my God, look at you, girls.

507
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:28,150
I can't believe I'm
finally meeting you.

508
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,309
Get out of the car.

509
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:32,067
I'm Anu, I think
you all know that.

510
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,359
- I'm May.
- May.

511
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,781
Yes, oh, my God.

512
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:36,484
Ooh.

513
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,403
I've heard so much about you.

514
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,200
Your dad's so proud of you.

515
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,281
On.

516
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,616
And, um, Dalia?

517
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,747
Come on out.

518
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:48,170
I've seen so many
pictures of you, come on.

519
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,246
Yeah.

520
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,672
- How are you?
- Good.

521
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,420
You're a grown-up girl now.

522
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,712
Um, Yasmine, Yasmine, oh.

523
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:59,385
- You're done.
- You're so beautiful.

524
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,808
Prettier than the
pictures, all of you.

525
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,556
Thank you for coming,
girls, come on in... come.

526
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,308
Of course.

527
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:09,225
Sorry, your dad had to be in Jerusalem
with Ambassador Williamson,

528
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:10,588
but he should be
here any minute.

529
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,486
- So we'll get to hang out and, um...
- He's not even here.

530
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,401
Fruit salad?

531
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,110
Yasmine?

532
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,195
- Yes, thank you.
- There you go.

533
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,373
- Thanks.
- Dalia?

534
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:25,745
Unh-unh.

535
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,076
I'll have hers.

536
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:28,535
. Okay-

537
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,961
Just something... for you.

538
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,251
I guess...

539
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,583
<i>Okay.</i>

540
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,505
So...

541
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,223
Where are you from in India?

542
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,851
Oh, I'm originally
from North India.

543
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,474
But I grew up in Mumbai.

544
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,355
I actually lived
in New York, too.

545
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:53,606
I studied there.

546
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,814
I did not get my work permit
so I decided to move to Dubai.

547
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:59,776
And that's great, because
that's where I met your dad.

548
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,361
He was living in the
hotel I was managing.

549
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:06,415
He's got a real foreign
fetish, don't you think?

550
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:17,134
Um... I hear you have a fiancé
who's Palestinian, right?

551
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,426
Yeah.

552
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:19,845
- Okay.
- He is.

553
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,213
And?

554
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,716
Does he live here?

555
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,223
Um... he grew up here.

556
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,606
But he's been in New
York for 15 years now.

557
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,731
I actually saw an interview
of him on the internet.

558
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:39,031
He is quite a good-looking guy.

559
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:41,108
And very well-spoken, too.

560
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:45,654
He actually reminded me of
Edward the first time I saw him.

561
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,911
I'm sorry, I'm so
sorry I'm late.

562
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,338
I can't believe how
crazy it's gotten.

563
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,757
There's a complete bottleneck.

564
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,215
I'm so happy you're here.

565
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,297
It started with a
heaviness in my chest.

566
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,803
I thought I maybe had heartburn
or something like that.

567
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,884
Spiciest chicken biryani does
not give him a heartburn.

568
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,767
Ana's the one who insisted
that I go to the hospital.

569
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,520
I come from a family of doctors.

570
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:17,944
And they say that there's nothing
wrong with me, so, I'm... I'm good.

571
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:19,487
Thank God.

572
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:20,564
Yeah.

573
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,240
So tell me about
how you girls are.

574
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,692
I wanna hear about that, so...

575
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,448
You're writing
another book, May.

576
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:26,912
- Yeah, I am.
- Good.

577
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,247
- It's a novel.
- What's it about?

578
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:33,247
Well, it's maybe historical
fiction, I really don't knew yet.

579
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,829
But it's, um, it's set
in 1948 Palestine.

580
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:39,257
Ed, did you tell her about
how we read her first book?

581
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,584
Oh, that's right.

582
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,211
Anu brought it to me, she
read it before I did.

583
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,638
And I read it twice.

584
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:45,714
And loved it.

585
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,219
You read it twice?

586
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:50,929
I didn't quite finish it the
second time but I still intend to.

587
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:53,639
Because I love it,
it's really clever.

588
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:57,477
But the real achievement is the
way you have put a human face

589
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,813
on so many of the conflicts in the
region, that's rare, that's...

590
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,148
- It's beautiful.
- I'm so proud of you.

591
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,573
- Thank you.
- Yes.

592
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:06,197
As I am of you, Dalia,
because I understand

593
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,620
that you're gonna be
finishing massage school.

594
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:10,114
Actually, no.

595
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,158
I dropped out.

596
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,581
I'm a massage school dropout.

597
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:19,753
Uh, well, that's probably for the
best because I imagine there isn't

598
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,584
a lot of money in-in
that massage business.

599
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:26,422
You know, I'm thinking that since your
Mom's here and Anu and I are here,

600
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,849
and you're both looking
for work, huh?

601
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,347
- How do you know that?
- What?

602
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:34,475
Oh, your mom called when
he was in the hospital.

603
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,558
Yeah, what... she just
said you were laid off.

604
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,400
All's I'm saying is that, you know,
you might wanna consider moving here,

605
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,356
because there's a lot
of opportunity here.

606
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,567
There is, and we'd love to
help you out in any way.

607
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,211
You could work with
refugees in the U.N.

608
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:51,079
or you could do capacity
building with the embassy.

609
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:54,454
There's a couple of spots in the
office that I think would be great.

610
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,331
And you'd really might like it.

611
00:33:56,409 --> 00:34:00,255
I think, I personally would
rather shoot myself in the head

612
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,332
than represent U.S.
foreign policies.

613
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:05,089
Especially in a Middle
Eastern country, I mean...

614
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:08,630
Tell me about the wedding.

615
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,799
Your mom is still
boycotting this?

616
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:15,145
Well, we'll support you, no
matter what, with everything.

617
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,563
- Right, lobster?
- That's right.

618
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,642
We went through something
really very similar.

619
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,398
It all works out.

620
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,193
And don't let anyone
tell you any different.

621
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:27,941
Dalia, how about some more lamb?

622
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,242
Um...

623
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,663
- Oh, Dalia doesn't...
- Dalia doesn't eat lamb.

624
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,241
Oh, come on, you're just...
teasing me.

625
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,951
Come on, you love lamb, Dalia.

626
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,377
I love lamb, Dad.

627
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:42,957
Dalia's a vegetarian.

628
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,751
Yup.

629
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,257
How about your dad and I
take you guys somewhere?

630
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:51,306
Uh, we came here every
summer growing up so...

631
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:52,724
We've been all over.

632
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,350
There's gotta be someplace
you want to see,

633
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,428
- how about Dami mountains?
- Been there.

634
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:59,978
You really haven't said
very much about Ziad.

635
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,600
You haven't asked.

636
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,022
All right, let's see.

637
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,105
He is, uh, professor at
Columbia, I know that.

638
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,278
Yeah, he's their
Palestinian expert.

639
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:10,241
That's impressive.

640
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:12,317
He's written two books on
the economy of Palestine.

641
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,033
He's working on his third.

642
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:17,245
He's written all kinds of
articles, essays, op-eds.

643
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,496
He's doing pretty
well for himself.

644
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:20,668
Yeah.

645
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,417
You sure he's the one?

646
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,833
That's why I'm
marrying him, Dad.

647
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,930
So he must be a pretty
special guy, right?

648
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,228
You still playing tennis?

649
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,397
It's been a while.

650
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,857
Good, that's the way
I like to play you.

651
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,275
You wanna play tomorrow?

652
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,984
I can't tomorrow, but
I'd love to play.

653
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,663
You could've told me you'd
be gone for the whole day.

654
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:02,085
I needed the car.

655
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:03,712
- We didn't know.
- Sorry.

656
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,760
You must be hungry.

657
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,254
- Yes.
- No.

658
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,844
We stopped at Uncle Waleed's...

659
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,388
Maram fed us a little.

660
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,813
What's wrong?

661
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:31,614
It's not good?

662
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,488
- No, it's really good.
- Thank you, Mom.

663
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,909
Mm-hmm.

664
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,657
So what did Maram cook?

665
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,824
Leg of lamb.

666
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,459
It was really dry.

667
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:02,392
##

668
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,525
That's so cute.

669
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,461
I'm not thinking holy thoughts.

670
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:40,545
Okay.

671
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,380
I never thought I
would hook up here.

672
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,182
Yesterday, we made out in
the elevator for two hours.

673
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,539
- Does he live with his parents?
- Yeah, they all do here.

674
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,555
Now I know why they get married
so young so they can get laid...

675
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,890
- Shh.
- Hmm?

676
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,725
What about him?

677
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,269
He's married.

678
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,568
He's cute.

679
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,199
That could come right off, Mom.

680
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:04,073
If I'm gonna do it again,
I better do it right.

681
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,870
He has to be a
Palestinian Christian.

682
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:09,290
And he has to know how
to cook and do laundry,

683
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:13,711
And if he has to travel, he better
travel for fun and not for work.

684
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,335
All right, well, you're gonna have
better luck at the second coming.

685
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,008
But Jesus has facial hair so
that's gonna be a problem.

686
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,670
We don't make fun of Jesus.

687
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,200
One minute.

688
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:18,995
Hello?

689
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,079
<i>- May?</i>
- Yeah.

690
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,881
- It? A878.
- Hi.

691
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:25,293
Oh... I-I can't talk right now.

692
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,254
<i>Oh, that's okay.</i>

693
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,131
I...

694
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:30,841
I just, uh...

695
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,635
Is everything okay?

696
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:36,938
<i>I promised I was not gonna cry.</i>

697
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,774
<i>Yeah, um... May, can I...</i>

698
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:42,853
<i>Can I just take you
out for a coffee?</i>

699
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,650
Something wrong with Dad?

700
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:47,949
I have this terrible feeling,
May, the same one I had when,

701
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:50,368
when my first husband
left me and...

702
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:52,866
He wanted more children,

703
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:55,039
<i>and I couldn't give that
to him so he left me.</i>

704
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,634
- Uh, uh, uh...
- So <i>I</i> understand that,

705
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,957
<i>but Ed doesn't want any more children
and-and we're having great sex</i>

706
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:01,413
<i>so I don't understand why.</i>

707
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,498
Why are you telling me that?

708
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,551
<i>I think he's having
an affair, May.</i>

709
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:11,222
<i>You're playing tennis with him
day after tomorrow, aren't you?</i>

710
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,972
<i>I really want you to talk
to him and tell him...</i>

711
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:20,141
##

712
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,577
Shit.

713
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,211
- May.
- You need to tell your wife

714
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,968
she can't call me with
your marital problems.

715
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,717
Hi.

716
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,640
Black Label on the rocks.

717
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,104
Anything for you, sir?

718
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,479
He'll have the same,
he's gonna need it.

719
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,903
Uh, I guess we're
not gonna play.

720
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,981
She thinks you're
having an affair.

721
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:11,741
All right, look, uh...

722
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:14,194
Anu can be dramatic...

723
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:15,745
You're not doing
this to me again.

724
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,993
Dad, you are not putting me
in the middle of your shit.

725
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,244
- Please.
- It is not okay.

726
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,121
Will you just sit down, please.

727
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,544
I am sorry that she called you.

728
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,248
Sit down.

729
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:31,048
Anu is lonely, Anu doesn't
have a lot of friends here.

730
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:33,046
She is not like you.

731
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:34,506
She can be like a kid sometimes.

732
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:35,789
She can get a little insecure.

733
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:36,799
Maybe because you're
cheating on her.

734
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:37,884
No, it's not like that.

735
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:39,139
You think I wanna go
through that again.

736
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,391
Do you think that's something I'm
prepared to, kind of, relive.

737
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,814
It was...

738
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,190
Trust me.

739
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:55,239
I'm not that person anymore.

740
00:44:56,986 --> 00:45:00,115
I used to think the grass was
greener, you know, but then you...

741
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,997
You get there and you look
closer and it's just...

742
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:05,077
it's not greener,
it's just different.

743
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:06,504
What does that mean?

744
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,623
You're not cheating?

745
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,464
It means that I learned
from my mistakes.

746
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,387
I think it's important for you to
understand what I've been through.

747
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:16,760
Oh, my God, I'm not gonna
sit here and listen...

748
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,386
Would you just
stop for a second.

749
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:21,310
I know I'm not who
you wanted me to be.

750
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,683
But I'm your father and
I'm not gonna go anywhere

751
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:26,687
and I just think that you
and I deserve to figure out

752
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:30,111
how we can have some kind of
relationship that's real.

753
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:33,773
Is that what you wanted, Dad, when you
didn't bother calling on our birthdays?

754
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,529
All right, you have every
right to be angry with me...

755
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,048
Yeah, I have every
right to be angry.

756
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,827
I spent years of my life
trying to fill your shoes

757
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:42,373
so don't sit here and tell me
you want a real relationship.

758
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:49,448
Just... trying to say that I'm here
now and making an effort... now.

759
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,020
I, um...

760
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:18,697
And I would completely understand
if you continue to hate me.

761
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,792
I don't hate you, Dad.

762
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,001
Dalia hates me.

763
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:38,676
Dalia doesn't hate
you, no one hates you.

764
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:42,801
She was 12 when you and Mom started
throwing dishes at one another.

765
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:46,228
Your mother threw the dishes,
I never threw any dishes.

766
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,436
All right, one dish, once.

767
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:53,152
And it wasn't aimed
at your mother.

768
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:55,905
It's mind-boggling that the two
of you even ended up together.

769
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,653
You have nothing in common.

770
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,442
That's not true.

771
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,485
We had a lot in common.

772
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:04,243
And then we just drifted
apart, I guess.

773
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,583
Your mother's a very hard person
to please, you know that.

774
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:12,004
No matter what I did, you know, she...
I couldn't make her happy.

775
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:13,957
Are you happy?

776
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,751
I...

777
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:21,927
I think the mere that I figure out
about myself, the easier it gets.

778
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:33,567
<i>Hi, you've reached Ziad.</i>

779
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,235
<i>Leave me a message,
I'll call you back.</i>

780
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:36,984
Hey, it's me.

781
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,157
You will never believe
what just happened.

782
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,569
I had a conversation
with my dad.

783
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,656
Like, an actual conversation
for the first time in-

784
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,206
I don't even know
in how many years.

785
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:54,168
That just made me
think about so much.

786
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,249
Anyway, I'm seeing
your mom tomorrow.

787
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,502
It's sort of like seeing you.

788
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,887
Call me, bye.

789
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,814
Hmm.

790
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:22,651
Interesting.

791
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:40,460
TIME'!

792
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,576
Un-huh.

793
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,713
You said you suck!

794
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:19,874
I haven't played in a while.

795
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,959
Yeah, I see how you are.

796
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:25,839
Come on.

797
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:28,348
- Okay.
- Come on.

798
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,468
##

799
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:39,561
. Oh!

800
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:40,937
Yes.

801
00:49:58,329 --> 00:49:59,581
<i>Yeah.</i>

802
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:04,635
So who do I have to blame
for this humiliation?

803
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,802
<i>'</i> My dad.

804
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:07,130
Yeah?

805
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:10,516
He's very good and he knows it.

806
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,477
Modesty is not exactly
his strong suit.

807
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,105
Sol made it my mission
in life to beat him.

808
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,181
. And?

809
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,516
Never happened.

810
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:20,439
Well, you kicked my ass.

811
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,527
So how did you get into
adventure tourism?

812
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:28,158
I was 20, I was
studying engineering.

813
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,241
I was lost, miserable <i>so...</i>

814
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:36,076
I took a tour to Thailand.

815
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:39,162
It was an adventure
tour and it changed me.

816
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:44,001
I discovered that this is
what I wanna do with my life.

817
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:47,428
I wanna do that for people
who come to Jordan.

818
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:52,725
And it's fun, you know, every
day, all day, I get to have fun.

819
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,805
You on the other hand, you would
never get to understand it,

820
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,898
- Oh.
- Because you're too much busy

821
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:02,602
being ambitious, yeah?

822
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:04,646
- Right.
- Yeah.

823
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:06,231
- Yup.
- Yeah.

824
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,316
That's me.

825
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:11,323
I am working on my
second book, so...

826
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:14,534
Putting me to shame.

827
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:15,739
Good.

828
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:18,576
How do you have the time
to write, I mean...

829
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:21,128
Aren't you busy planning
for your wedding stuff?

830
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,546
It's soon, isn't it?

831
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:23,622
Less than two weeks.

832
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:25,708
So how does it feel like?

833
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:30,421
Good, better feel good, it's
too late to back out now.

834
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:42,395
I'm sorry, I don't know
why I just said that.

835
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,600
It's never too late to back out.

836
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:44,936
No, I didn't mean it,
I didn't mean it.

837
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:47,099
I don't want to back out, I
don't know why I said it.

838
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,942
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

839
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,611
Wow, I'm a...

840
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,073
TIFF-II

841
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,992
Um...

842
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:03,003
I'll tell you something,
it's not you, okay, it's me.

843
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,881
I am exceptionally
easy to talk to.

844
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:10,302
People tell me things all the
time so it's not a big deal.

845
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:11,838
Seriously.

846
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:18,595
If you need someone to be an
idiot with, I'm here, okay?

847
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:30,944
Thanks for the ride.

848
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:32,275
You're welcome.

849
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,193
. <i>See Ya'</i> . <i>Bye-</i>

850
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,195
Bye.

851
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:37,904
##

852
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:48,878
<i>Hey, babe, it's me.</i>

853
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:51,255
<i>I can't believe you
ended up with your dad.</i>

854
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:52,837
<i>That was a long time coming.</i>

855
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,264
<i>Um, call me when you can, okay?</i>

856
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,758
<i>I'll be up late grading papers.</i>

857
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,184
<i>I really wanna talk to you.</i>

858
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:03,605
<i>Uh... I hope your writing's
going well and, uh,</i>

859
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:06,066
<i>okay, um, love you, bye.</i>

860
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,073
Hi.

861
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:21,789
Hi.

862
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,867
I was gonna brush my teeth.

863
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,703
It can wait.

864
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:33,757
You haven't been around much.

865
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,422
I know, I've been really busy.

866
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,215
Writing a lot.

867
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,231
We're going for my
bachelorette party, Mom.

868
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:48,067
Why, you wanna come?

869
00:53:58,402 --> 00:53:59,745
Who dropped you off?

870
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,572
A friend.

871
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,491
What friend?

872
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:06,665
His name's Karim.

873
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,009
I don't know his last name, Mom.

874
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,086
He could be Muslim or Hindu.

875
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,717
For all I know, he's Jewish.

876
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,469
Would that make you happy?

877
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:21,221
That's not why I asked.

878
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,385
And it wouldn't make me happy.

879
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:25,478
I don't believe in
these religions.

880
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:27,556
They don't believe
in yours either.

881
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,683
I don't have a religion, May.

882
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:31,110
I have the truth.

883
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:37,649
##

884
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,738
I'd like to take a moment
to explain about the hotel

885
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:27,371
and the facilities of the
hotel, if it's okay.

886
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:30,077
We're right now in the main
building called Zara building?

887
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,504
The room will be
located over here.

888
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:33,831
<i>On, my em!</i>

889
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:00,403
##

890
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,360
Isn't it crazy that
that's Palestine?

891
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,695
Yeah.

892
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:06,747
We could swim there.

893
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,330
If we wanted to die.

894
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:11,994
What?

895
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:13,959
There are landmines in here.

896
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:15,998
No way.

897
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,625
If you swim out too far.

898
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:22,054
How do you think they
keep the refugees out?

899
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:23,802
God, that is messed up.

900
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:27,556
Here we are with all
our petty problems.

901
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,602
Do we choose tall centerpieces
or short centerpieces?

902
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,440
Should we hire a band or a DJ?

903
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:38,771
Band.

904
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:43,572
Should we spend the entire
lifesavings or only half of it.

905
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:44,902
All of it.

906
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:47,655
Yeah...

907
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:49,957
It is pretty ridiculous.

908
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,462
Why do people even
do it anymore?

909
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,419
I don't know.

910
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,210
You would think that the
50 percent divorce rate,

911
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:03,967
people would not
wanna do it as much.

912
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,174
At least keep it simple.

913
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,509
Geez.

914
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:14,523
I mean, wouldn't it be nice to
just exchange vows in a garden?

915
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,772
Drink a glass of champagne?

916
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:21,480
Shove cupcakes into
each other's faces?

917
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,982
And just go on a honeymoon?

918
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,359
That sounds great.

919
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,403
Why don't you guys do that?

920
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,369
Ziad wanted the
traditional thing.

921
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,042
Mostly for his family.

922
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:37,713
Couldn't you make some
kind of compromise?

923
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,425
I didn't wanna make a
big deal out of it.

924
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:46,297
Then how is it a big deal
if it's what you want?

925
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:53,770
You're having doubts, May?

926
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:55,431
No.

927
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,434
I don't know.

928
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:03,030
I hear myself say it and I
think, "What is wrong with me?"

929
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:05,107
Why can't I just be happy?

930
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,114
He's so good to me.

931
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:10,780
Do you know how many
drafts of my book he read?

932
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:14,537
How many times he made me
dinner when I was writing.

933
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,911
He brings me breakfast in bed.

934
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:19,997
<i>Who does that'?</i>

935
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:23,588
He makes the best egg
white frittata ever.

936
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:27,338
But that doesn't mean
you have to marry him.

937
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,600
What are you doing out here?

938
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,932
Where's Tamer?

939
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:39,566
Having a work crisis.

940
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:41,394
That sucks.

941
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:45,481
Well, at least we get to spend
some time to ourselves, right?

942
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:48,108
We always have
time to ourselves.

943
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,027
. Okay-

944
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,321
Uh, hey, uh...

945
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:04,417
[AMP-IE

946
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:07,173
You sound like an obnoxious
American, that's all.

947
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:08,591
At least I speak Arabic.

948
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:12,015
You speak just as shitty
Arabic as I do, Yasmine.

949
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:15,268
I do not speak
shitty Arabic, okay?

950
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,182
I took two years in college.

951
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:18,263
So what?

952
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:19,467
I taught myself how to read.

953
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:21,016
You have to sound things
out like a child.

954
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,396
Which is more than you can say.

955
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:23,773
- Excuse me?
- I understand the meanings

956
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:25,729
- of the words...
- Doesn't matter if you can't speak it.

957
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,655
You don't even understand
the origin of the word...

958
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:29,733
Guys, you speak equally
shitty Arabic.

959
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:34,113
Let's relax.

960
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,291
# Let me get on in it #

961
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:45,294
# I wanna make love
with you, you, you #

962
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,750
# Come on let me get it #

963
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,380
# Let me get up in it #

964
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,883
# I wanna make love
with you, you, you... #

965
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,214
Men are retarded.

966
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:57,390
##

967
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:12,735
No.

968
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,532
Dalia... Stop it!

969
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:23,746
Perfect.

970
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:26,961
##

971
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,752
Yasmine, stop it.

972
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:32,846
It's in my nose.

973
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:42,098
Hey!

974
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:50,815
Hello.

975
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:52,358
Hi.

976
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:55,861
- HEY
- Hey.

977
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:57,279
Where have you been?

978
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,330
Stupid clients can't
make up their minds.

979
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:02,535
At the last minute, they wanted
some changes on their website.

980
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:04,619
I had to do it, Yasmine.

981
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,038
Yeah, of course.

982
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:08,749
We're glad you could join us.

983
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:10,175
Please, don't be mad.

984
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:12,836
I'm not, you're blocking my sun.

985
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,509
I wanna have a good time.

986
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:20,936
No one's stopping you.

987
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,602
I wanna have a good
time with you.

988
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:29,152
Come on, Yasmine, he
couldn't help it.

989
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,021
Excuse me?

990
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,606
You're defending him?

991
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:35,109
You're being unfair.

992
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,453
What do you know?

993
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:40,572
Just trying to help.

994
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,453
Well, I don't need
your help, okay?

995
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:45,126
Why don't you go flirt with
the bartender some more?

996
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:46,419
Okay, I think I should go.

997
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:47,746
No, no, stay.

998
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,516
What the hell was that
supposed to mean?

999
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,089
It means you seem a
little confused, lately.

1000
01:01:53,168 --> 01:01:56,297
Why, because I'm actually friendly
to people and not bitchy, like you.

1001
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,131
Is that what you call
that, being friendly?

1002
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,717
Well, maybe you should
stop being so friendly.

1003
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,767
I mean, people might get
the wrong impression.

1004
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,845
You are getting
married, aren't you?

1005
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,647
That's right, run away
like you always do.

1006
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,728
Run and hide, that's the answer.

1007
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:15,574
Hi, my name is May and
my life is perfect.

1008
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:17,492
And you're all the
fucked-up ones.

1009
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,240
What do you want, Yasmine?

1010
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:21,492
I wanna know why
Ziad isn't here?

1011
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,869
And I wanna know why you don't
give a shit about your wedding?

1012
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:25,872
Because I don't know that I
wanna go through with it.

1013
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:27,272
Well, then why
didn't you tell us?

1014
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,328
Tell you what?

1015
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,913
I don't even know
what to tell myself.

1016
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,464
Wouldn't it help
to talk about it?

1017
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:33,462
And risk the whole
world finding out?

1018
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,509
- No.
- Come on, that is such bullshit.

1019
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,337
Yasmine, Yasmine?

1020
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,640
Did you tell Tamer that I'm gay?

1021
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:42,468
Dalia, now's not the time.

1022
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:46,054
His friend Chati just outed himself
to me because he thinks that I'm gay.

1023
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,184
Aren't you?

1024
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:48,607
That's not the point.

1025
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,314
Are you going around and
just telling everybody?

1026
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:54,067
What am I supposed
to do, okay, lie?

1027
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:57,316
Who I do or do net sleep with
is rue-body's business, okay?

1028
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:58,525
See big mouth?

1029
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,155
So, what, you think
I can't be trusted.

1030
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:01,236
- You can't be.
- You can't be.

1031
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:02,366
I wasn't talking to you.

1032
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:04,243
How could you tell people
that, how can I trust you?

1033
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,539
You are always telling
people things.

1034
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,788
If you knew something was wrong,
why didn't you say anything?

1035
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:08,914
Don't blame us?

1036
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:11,668
How were we supposed to know you're
thinking of calling the whole thing off.

1037
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:12,747
Wait, What?

1038
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:13,832
I thought you were gonna
wait till Ziad got here.

1039
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,588
I'm not calling it off.

1040
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:17,344
You told Dalia?

1041
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:20,218
You told Dalia and
you didn't tell me.

1042
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:25,385
I told Dalia this morning while
you were busy making out

1043
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,095
with your boyfriend,
thank you very much.

1044
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:29,647
But I'm really glad to know
that that's all you care about.

1045
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:31,316
You wonder why I
can't talk to you?

1046
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:32,859
You have never
been happy for me.

1047
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,186
- Excuse me?
- Either of you.

1048
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:35,270
Whoa, what?

1049
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:38,197
No, you wish you were the one
getting married and you...

1050
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:39,866
don't think anyone
should get married.

1051
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:40,942
I never said that, May.

1052
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:42,744
Gays don't have the
same rights, I get it.

1053
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,662
Gays, what is wrong
with you people.

1054
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:46,160
Why do you think I'm gay?

1055
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,119
'Cause you haven't had a
boyfriend in ten years.

1056
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:50,911
So what... I'm so sorry
to disappoint all of you.

1057
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:54,248
And you know what, even if someone
is, I mean, there's nothin wrong...

1058
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:55,753
I never said there was!

1059
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:59,006
I only told Tamer because I was proud
to have a sister who was a lesbian.

1060
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:00,758
I am not a lesbian!

1061
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,037
I saw your mom.

1062
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,316
We went to the wedding planner

1063
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:34,042
and he was showing us
the reception hall.

1064
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:39,293
And I just kept thinking I
don't know how to do this.

1065
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:40,919
<i>You're-you're upset, okay.</i>

1066
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:43,718
Just listen to me, Ziad.

1067
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,307
<i>You need a break
from your family.</i>

1068
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:51,730
<i>They're making you crazy.</i>

1069
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:53,519
Well, then, we're all crazy.

1070
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:57,068
<i>Okay, I'm gonna he there
in a few days, all right?</i>

1071
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,736
<i>We'll figure all of this out.</i>

1072
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:00,064
. May?

1073
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:04,777
Mom called.

1074
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:07,738
<i>May?</i>

1075
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:16,080
Edward.

1076
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:17,623
On.

1077
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:19,041
Oh, my goodness.

1078
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:20,333
. Dad?

1079
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:21,669
Hey, Dad, hi.

1080
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:24,045
Was it another heart attack?

1081
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:28,175
Well, they did some tests and
we'll hear in a little bit.

1082
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,101
Good to see you...

1083
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:33,054
Nice to meet you.

1084
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:35,140
I heard so much about you.

1085
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:36,600
No, you too.

1086
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:39,894
Not all bad things, I hope.

1087
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,272
No.

1088
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:46,326
Girls, it's so nice
to see you again.

1089
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:49,075
I only wish it was under
different circumstances.

1090
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:53,830
That's right, you had lunch together
and you cooked a leg of lamb, right?

1091
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:57,788
It's hard to make it
tender, don't you think?

1092
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:02,300
Dad, uh, when did it happen,
exactly, like what happened?

1093
01:06:02,834 --> 01:06:04,177
I was playing tennis.

1094
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:07,471
It was way too hot to
be playing tennis.

1095
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:09,470
Do you remember when
you two used to play?

1096
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:11,347
Yeah, you hated it
when we played.

1097
01:06:11,426 --> 01:06:12,928
'Cause you got so competitive.

1098
01:06:13,011 --> 01:06:15,264
I thought you were going
to kill each other.

1099
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:20,443
Oh, you know, it was... I guess I was
sweating a little bit more than usual.

1100
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:24,239
I kept playing and then all of
a sudden, I got really cold.

1101
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:25,566
Everything went white.

1102
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:27,697
I wasn't feeling any pain.

1103
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:30,245
Could it be, this is the end?

1104
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:33,077
Not too bad way to go.

1105
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:35,409
Wham, chest pains kicked in.

1106
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,706
I was at home when
I got the call.

1107
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:43,462
I don't know what I
would have done.

1108
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:44,918
Are you hungry?

1109
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:46,799
Are they feeding you well?

1110
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:49,594
Anu brought me some chicken
soup from the cafeteria.

1111
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:54,849
Which was very good, because I got my
first meal, and what was it: Salmon.

1112
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,021
- Oh, God.
- Oh, no.

1113
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,148
I can't believe they
brought you salmon.

1114
01:06:59,224 --> 01:07:00,567
I'll talk to them.

1115
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,026
- Okay.
- I already did.

1116
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:06,148
Well, that's good.

1117
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:10,823
##

1118
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:37,183
##

1119
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:36,204
I was looking for my... my rope.

1120
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:39,749
Have you seen it?

1121
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:41,834
No.

1122
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:56,133
You're awake too?

1123
01:08:56,758 --> 01:08:59,102
- I am now.
- Me too.

1124
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:01,517
I need a cigarette.

1125
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:12,115
Do you know what
you're gonna do?

1126
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:14,734
Please, don't ask me that.

1127
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:19,197
All rig ht.

1128
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:23,418
I forgot, no one in this
family tells me anything.

1129
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:26,838
He gets here tomorrow,
Yasmine, and I have no clue.

1130
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,594
Why can't we talk
like normal people?

1131
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:36,264
It's just like when Mom
and Dad got divorced.

1132
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:38,971
No one told me
what was going on.

1133
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,347
You think I wanted to know?

1134
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:41,973
I wish no one had told me.

1135
01:09:42,053 --> 01:09:43,305
Come on, May.

1136
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:47,521
Here we are, always
saying we're so close.

1137
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,274
What do we actually
know about each other?

1138
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:56,360
When were you actually gonna tell us
that you were fired and not laid off?

1139
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,703
When are you gonna
tell us you're gay?

1140
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,296
You know, I don't...

1141
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:10,586
I don't need labels, okay?

1142
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:14,378
I don't.

1143
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:17,004
But if it makes you happier...

1144
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:19,841
Then, yes.

1145
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:25,475
I like women.

1146
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:36,358
It took you years to tell us.

1147
01:10:36,441 --> 01:10:39,411
I know, but I just need
to do it at my own speed.

1148
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:41,158
I couldn't do it just...

1149
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,489
Okay.

1150
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,173
Why were you fired?

1151
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:55,635
'Cause I opened my...

1152
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:58,221
'Cause I opened my big mouth.

1153
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:03,184
And the agency lost a major
account because of me.

1154
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:08,397
I have no idea what to do.

1155
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:11,856
I haven't been able
to write in months.

1156
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:16,655
May, you just need to take
some time off, man, I mean,

1157
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:18,404
you're just, like,
going non-stop.

1158
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:23,113
Here.

1159
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:29,748
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

1160
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:32,505
I didn't mean to, you know...

1161
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:34,006
I'll be right back.

1162
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:35,253
How am I gonna tell Mom?

1163
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:36,755
I have no idea.

1164
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:39,132
- She's going to freak out.
- Well, I'm here.

1165
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:43,804
I'm exhausted, but I
need to see you too.

1166
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:48,020
<i>Hi, you've reached Ziad.</i>

1167
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:51,599
Yeah, yeah, okay.

1168
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:55,736
I'm on my way.

1169
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,398
<i>Okay.</i>

1170
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:01,905
Whoa, patience, I'm
on my way, bye.

1171
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:07,408
##

1172
01:12:23,381 --> 01:12:24,724
Dude, what are you doing?

1173
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:26,051
Mom left.

1174
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:27,340
What do you mean, she left.

1175
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:30,017
I don't know, she just...
she... snuck out.

1176
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,015
Holy shit.

1177
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:36,895
##

1178
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,691
- Guys, wait up.
- What's she doing?

1179
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:45,119
- Guys, just slow down.
- We need a taxi.

1180
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:47,618
Take it easy, guys,
I'm in my slippers.

1181
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:48,949
Taxi!

1182
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:53,287
- Where is she?
- I don't see her.

1183
01:12:54,996 --> 01:12:56,043
- We lost her.
- Right there, she's right there.

1184
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:57,123
Turn, turn, turn.

1185
01:12:58,624 --> 01:12:59,967
- Okay.
- Ow.

1186
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,136
- You heard right?
- Positive.

1187
01:13:03,254 --> 01:13:05,131
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

1188
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,591
I knew that Mom was a bad girl.

1189
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:08,597
You should've seen the lingerie
I found in her drawer.

1190
01:13:08,676 --> 01:13:10,178
I don't wanna know about that.

1191
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:11,387
Maybe she has a lover.

1192
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,814
Maybe she met someone at church.

1193
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:16,442
What is she doing?

1194
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:22,315
She just pulled in...
stop, stop, stop.

1195
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,650
Stop, pull over.

1196
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,087
Wait, wait, I'm scared.

1197
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:37,835
Shh... Okay, now, go.

1198
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,499
<i>Shh.</i>

1199
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,058
Let's go, come on.

1200
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:05,366
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.
- Mom?

1201
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:06,863
What are you doing here?

1202
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:07,944
Okay.

1203
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:09,907
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing?

1204
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:10,993
Did you follow me?

1205
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:12,619
You're having an
affair with Mom?

1206
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:14,291
Affair? We were married first.

1207
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:15,994
L-I wanted to tell
you, believe me.

1208
01:14:16,077 --> 01:14:17,545
And I think we should
talk about it now.

1209
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,918
- There is nothing to tell.
- Wait, you knew about this?

1210
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:20,998
What do you mean, there's
nothing to tell?

1211
01:14:21,082 --> 01:14:22,425
Anu called me crying.

1212
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:24,260
Since when Anu calls you?

1213
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:25,712
You're having an
affair with Dad?

1214
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:26,796
Please lower your voice.

1215
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:28,506
All right, I don't think
you should go right now.

1216
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:31,310
- No, no, you have to rest...
- I think we should talk, girls, quiet,

1217
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:32,594
- we need, stay, don't go.
- Edward, we will talk.

1218
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:34,020
Where are my shoes?

1219
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:38,099
After everything he
put you through?

1220
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:40,182
- He put us through.
- I don't wanna talk about it.

1221
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:42,399
No, Mom, you are not
gonna get off that easy.

1222
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,151
Listen, I didn't plan it.

1223
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:46,107
It just happened.

1224
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:47,863
Mom, affairs don't just happen.

1225
01:14:47,942 --> 01:14:49,489
How long as this
been going on for?

1226
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:51,115
- None of your business.
- None of our business?

1227
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:52,697
We were there to
pick up the pieces.

1228
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:56,159
So am I just supposed to
stop loving him like that?

1229
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:58,336
I was married to the
man for 20 years.

1230
01:14:58,411 --> 01:15:01,085
You have no idea
what it means to...

1231
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:03,716
just live with
someone for so long.

1232
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:05,752
<i>So you're getting back together?</i>

1233
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:07,883
How can you ever trust
him again, Mom?

1234
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:09,259
Who says I trust him.

1235
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:12,057
- Then what are you doing?
- Besides being a hypocrite?

1236
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:14,601
- Excuse me?
- A hypocrite, Mother.

1237
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:16,304
Someone who pretends to be holy.

1238
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:19,106
You're so holy you can't go to
your own daughter's wedding.

1239
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:21,855
For your information,
I was planning to go.

1240
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:24,479
<i>Oh... oh, I'm so happy.</i>

1241
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:26,364
You've changed your mind.

1242
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:28,817
Do you think I'm happy?

1243
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:30,867
There's nothing for
me to live for.

1244
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:33,913
There's nothin to do but sit
around and wait to die.

1245
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:36,616
That is bullshit, Mom, do not try
to make us feel sorry for you.

1246
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:37,825
Why are you so angry?

1247
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:40,081
Have I ever stopped you
from marrying him?

1248
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:41,561
You have been trying
to break us up.

1249
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,497
You think I don't know what
that whole knot thing is about?

1250
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:45,254
It's about your father!

1251
01:15:49,336 --> 01:15:52,010
I never planed on missing
your wedding, May.

1252
01:15:52,465 --> 01:15:54,138
Even if I don't approve.

1253
01:15:57,887 --> 01:16:01,357
You... you want me to believe you've
been planning to come this entire time?

1254
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:04,602
Yes.

1255
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:12,777
<i>May-</i>

1256
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:19,118
##

1257
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:47,896
Hi.

1258
01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:50,440
Everything okay?

1259
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:55,991
I don't wanna go home.

1260
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:57,413
Can we go somewhere?

1261
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,826
Okay, let's go.

1262
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:02,409
##

1263
01:17:40,698 --> 01:17:42,371
Wake up, sleepy head.

1264
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:45,036
Hello?

1265
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:48,793
- Okay, Zidan, please.
- Where are we?

1266
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:51,467
Uh, it's a surprise.

1267
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:54,003
You okay?

1268
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:55,679
- Yeah.
- You up?

1269
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:06,474
##

1270
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:17,034
Can you see that one?

1271
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:18,452
It's speaking to you.

1272
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:20,280
What's it say?

1273
01:18:21,405 --> 01:18:24,079
I don't know, I
don't speak star.

1274
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,952
Then what good are you?

1275
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:28,876
My parents are fucking.

1276
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:35,844
Is that unusual?

1277
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:40,090
They've been divorced
for eight years.

1278
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:43,303
My dad's remarried.

1279
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:45,972
Oh, shit.

1280
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:49,400
What does it mean?

1281
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:53,320
What does it mean!

1282
01:18:57,816 --> 01:19:00,820
This is where speaking
star would come in handy.

1283
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:04,244
Maybe it means they
still love each other.

1284
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:09,753
All those years of
misery for nothin.

1285
01:19:17,378 --> 01:19:21,428
Sometimes it takes
losing someone

1286
01:19:21,507 --> 01:19:24,181
to really know what
they mean to you.

1287
01:19:35,145 --> 01:19:39,696
Maybe if we worked harder, we could
actually hold onto something.

1288
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:44,656
Yeah, sure.

1289
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:50,168
Assuming that what you
have is right for you.

1290
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:57,756
It's amazing how cold
it gets out here.

1291
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:03,007
Come here.

1292
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:06,803
Come on.

1293
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:54,892
I'm sorry.

1294
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:56,519
I... I can't.

1295
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:25,982
##

1296
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:07,574
I'm calling it off.

1297
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:10,570
I know that makes you happy.

1298
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:11,904
May.

1299
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:32,099
##

1300
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:33,426
. May?

1301
01:23:33,634 --> 01:23:34,886
I'm sorry.

1302
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:39,556
##

1303
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:22,064
Oh, Jesus.

1304
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,392
Shh.

1305
01:25:00,721 --> 01:25:02,394
I know he loves you.

1306
01:25:05,267 --> 01:25:06,519
He always has.

1307
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:11,232
There's nothing I
can do about it.

1308
01:25:21,575 --> 01:25:23,919
Nadine, I really
need him right now.

1309
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:27,839
He needs me too.

1310
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:00,572
. May?

1311
01:26:06,787 --> 01:26:08,039
I'm not hungry.

1312
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:29,185
I'm fine.

1313
01:26:38,568 --> 01:26:41,868
I know it's not what you want to hear,
May, but it does make me happy.

1314
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:45,500
He's a good person
and I like him.

1315
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:47,577
But he's not right for you.

1316
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:49,876
And it's not his religion.

1317
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:54,214
I don't get you, Mom.

1318
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:57,470
You act like you don't
know what it's like

1319
01:26:57,546 --> 01:26:59,389
when you ran off and
married an American.

1320
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:01,683
I'm reminded of it
every single day.

1321
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:04,432
If it weren't for you
and your sisters,

1322
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:07,102
I would say it's the worst
mistake of my life.

1323
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:09,148
Am I supposed to believe that when
you're having an affair with him?

1324
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:11,818
You think I'm happy the
way my life turned out?

1325
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:17,282
He and I should be traveling
now, seeing the world.

1326
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:22,075
Instead, I'm sneaking like
a desperate teenager.

1327
01:27:27,284 --> 01:27:29,127
I have no idea what I'm doing.

1328
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:38,383
It's like I'm scared to end up
alone for the rest of my life.

1329
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:41,131
When I just have to
know that I will.

1330
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:42,636
You don't have to, Mom.

1331
01:27:42,716 --> 01:27:44,468
People don't fall
in love at my age.

1332
01:27:44,551 --> 01:27:45,552
Yes, they do.

1333
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:46,887
No, they don't.

1334
01:27:47,179 --> 01:27:48,431
Not here.

1335
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:56,655
Don't you go thinking that I
am happy to see you in pain.

1336
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:58,403
Since you were a baby...

1337
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:03,074
every time you cried, I cried.

1338
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:07,453
Especially you, because
you never cried.

1339
01:28:09,743 --> 01:28:11,871
I'm sorry you're
sneaking around.

1340
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:17,960
I gave the bastard
20 years of my life.

1341
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:20,504
And now...

1342
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:23,510
I'm the other woman.

1343
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:25,592
You were the only woman, Mom.

1344
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:27,803
He knows it.

1345
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:35,940
Let me talk to him.

1346
01:28:36,186 --> 01:28:38,188
They released him
from the hospital.

1347
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:41,942
Is he gonna stay with her?

1348
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:43,319
I don't know.

1349
01:28:58,583 --> 01:28:59,926
It's all my fault.

1350
01:29:03,088 --> 01:29:04,340
No, May.

1351
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:07,017
You did nothing wrong.

1352
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:13,182
You'll be okay.

1353
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:14,941
You know that, right?

1354
01:29:18,979 --> 01:29:20,981
Can I have some soup now?

1355
01:29:36,705 --> 01:29:37,205
##

1356
01:30:28,006 --> 01:30:29,258
<i>AN</i>

1357
01:30:29,716 --> 01:30:30,968
ET!

1358
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:35,772
All right, don't rub it in.

1359
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:37,190
Did I just win?

1360
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:38,733
You've gotten so good.

1361
01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:40,644
It's not me.

1362
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:44,523
How's your mother?

1363
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:47,776
She misses you.

1364
01:30:49,402 --> 01:30:50,745
Did she say that?

1365
01:30:52,822 --> 01:30:54,165
She didn't have to.

1366
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:57,953
Sure you don't
wanna stay longer?

1367
01:30:58,036 --> 01:31:00,380
- No, I can't, I can't.
- All right.

1368
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:03,382
What's gonna happen to you?

1369
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:04,710
I don't know.

1370
01:31:04,834 --> 01:31:05,835
Everything-

1371
01:31:05,919 --> 01:31:06,920
. Everything.

1372
01:31:07,003 --> 01:31:08,380
I hope, what about you?

1373
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:10,136
I'm gonna get my license.

1374
01:31:10,215 --> 01:31:12,013
I'm just gonna do it just
to make some extra cash

1375
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:13,719
to figure out what
I really wanna do.

1376
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:15,054
- Good.
- Yeah.

1377
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:16,267
- Cool.
- You ready?

1378
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:18,019
I can't believe you're
staying, this is so weird.

1379
01:31:18,098 --> 01:31:19,099
I know.

1380
01:31:19,182 --> 01:31:21,105
I'm never gonna have
sex ever again.

1381
01:31:23,353 --> 01:31:25,026
I'm excited to be
living with you.

1382
01:31:25,105 --> 01:31:26,106
You should be.

1383
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:27,486
You should all come
and live with me.

1384
01:31:27,565 --> 01:31:29,238
Yes, Oh... thank you.

1385
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:34,577
You know I hate good-byes.

1386
01:31:34,656 --> 01:31:35,999
I know, it's okay.

1387
01:31:36,116 --> 01:31:37,117
Okay, let's go.

1388
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,326
Yeah, I don't want
you to be late.

1389
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:39,411
You got your passport?

1390
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:40,495
You got your Buddha?

1391
01:31:40,578 --> 01:31:41,921
I got my Buddha.

1392
01:31:42,706 --> 01:31:43,958
Thank you.

1393
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:48,545
- Love you.
- Love you more.

1394
01:31:49,713 --> 01:31:50,714
Bye.

1395
01:31:50,797 --> 01:31:52,197
- Fly safe.
