1
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,949
Come on.

2
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,996
Come on, you stupid boy.

3
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,480
OK now, Charlie.

4
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,189
I'm going to show you the most
beautiful thing in the world.

5
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,874
- Do you know what it is?
- A shoe.

6
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,873
A lot of people would say
it'd be an oak tree in spring.

7
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,393
It's a shoe.

8
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,950
Lot of people would say
it'd be a field of flowers.

9
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,837
Do you know what I think it is?

10
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,989
A shoe.

11
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,752
I think it's a shoe.

12
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,596
Every machine. You'll learn how
to work every machine, Charlie.

13
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,638
And by the time you're old enough,
and married probably,

14
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,792
taking over the factory from me,
believe me,

15
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,715
first thing you'll notice
about a person is their shoes.

16
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,709
Come on.

17
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,594
You know, it's funny.
It's always struck me

18
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,913
that in terms of love, strength
and attention to detail,

19
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,719
marriage is pretty much like...

20
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,233
A pair of shoes.

21
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,550
And today again, I'm not wrong...

22
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,316
They take you to places,
perhaps, you weren't expecting.

23
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,549
My son. Off to London.

24
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,589
His fiancée been transferred
to an even bigger estate agents.

25
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,989
Young Charlie,
what have you decided

26
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,071
to try your hand at down there?

27
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,669
Marketing.

28
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,589
Marketing.

29
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,030
To my future daughter-in-law.

30
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,677
And to my wonderful son.

31
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,714
- Charlie.
- Charlie.

32
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,753
Ah, Mr Price.

33
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,717
Do let me show you around.

34
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,713
This is the new layout designed
with the young couple in mind.

35
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,552
As you see,
one good size bedroom,

36
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,870
with en-suite shower room.

37
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,033
And through here,
a fully-furnished lounge.

38
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,511
Oh, and best of all, Mr Price,
best of all...

39
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,438
The view.

40
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,918
It's not Northampton.

41
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,149
It's not Northampton.

42
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,275
No.

43
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,509
<i>Not Northampton</i>

44
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,158
<i>Not Northampton</i>

45
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,754
<i>We're not in Northampton anymore</i>

46
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,794
<i>- We're going where...
- Hello?</i>

47
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,314
<i>... sky is blue</i>

48
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,676
<i>Cos the best thing
about London is</i>

49
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,638
<i>No more bloody shoe...</i>

50
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,598
Yeah, this is his son.

51
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,909
Mr Price.

52
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,515
He'd have been proud of you
coming back, Mr Price.

53
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,749
Charlie.

54
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,550
Price factory has to have a Mr Price,
Mr Price.

55
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,555
George...

56
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,433
Bugger.

57
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,991
Dad always used to say that...

58
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,351
And in a sense...

59
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,231
He ain't pressed the button.

60
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,749
- My heart is...
- Press the red button.

61
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,357
That's a good start.

62
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,316
Right.

63
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,873
I'm not my dad. OK.
You shouldn't expect that.

64
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,077
But I've spent my life with
each one of you at some point,

65
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,835
training on these machines.

66
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,393
- I was bloody useless.
- Too right.

67
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,277
Thanks, Don.

68
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,880
Listen. Dad believed

69
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,590
there would always be a place
for craftsmanship.

70
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,434
And whether you realise it or not,
that is what you all are.

71
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,750
Craftsmen.

72
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,511
So let's make shoes.

73
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,030
Let's make shoes?

74
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,637
Don't worry, love.
Don't get it on your jacket.

75
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,154
I'll get some roll.

76
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,872
Pat, what order is the company
working on at the moment?

77
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,317
It's a big one, love.
Chambers Wholesale. Why?

78
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,640
What the hell was he playing at?

79
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,757
I mean, why didn't he...

80
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,876
Why did he carry on making 'em?

81
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,475
This happened before. 1992.

82
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,391
Customer went into receivership

83
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,756
and your dad got stuck
with 600 Oxfords.

84
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,875
And?

85
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,359
Bill Sampson in London

86
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,919
took 'em at cost.

87
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,472
Right. Pat, I'm going to London.

88
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,638
I just happen to find myself

89
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,678
with 1,200 pairs of brogues,
and I know, a few years back,

90
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,479
your dad took some at cost
off my dad and I thought...

91
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,109
That was a few years back, Charlie.
Things have changed a bit.

92
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,355
But look, I'll tell you what.

93
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,352
I'll take 200 pairs off your hands.
For old time's sake.

94
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,715
Hey, and this hurts.

95
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,997
Being a Forest fan giving
charity to a Northampton...

96
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,915
I mean, when I say charity
I'm not... you know.

97
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,796
Imported from Slovakia.
Wanna know how much?

98
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,269
Harry. A Price's shoe
will last a man a lifetime.

99
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,636
Poor sod that buys these will be back
in ten months for new ones.

100
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,076
I know. And isn't that great?

101
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,511
Spare some change, guv?

102
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,797
Here. This is a Price's shoe.

103
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,908
And it'll last a man a lifetime.

104
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,911
You got it in a size ten?

105
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,633
- Slow yourself down a bit.
- Wanna come to a party?

106
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,711
All right, gorgeous?

107
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,790
Come here.

108
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,791
Covering something, princess?

109
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,391
Where do you think you're going?

110
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,552
Don't worry, I'm not gonna harm you.
Just want a chat.

111
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,629
All right, lads?

112
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,195
I think you should just leave
her alone now, don't you think?

113
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,794
- Yeah? Come on then.
- Don't you?

114
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,758
Very sweet.
You riding to my rescue.

115
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,150
Very Prince Charming.

116
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,231
Pass me my boobs, will ya?

117
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,795
Here.

118
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,348
Didn't look like you
needed much rescuing.

119
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,718
Well, a girl has to know
how to look after herself these days.

120
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,837
There are some
very funny people out there.

121
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,278
How's that wound?
Let's have a look.

122
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,231
Don't flatter yourself.

123
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,517
Vodka. Helps you forget pain.

124
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,718
Well, it does me.

125
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,999
God. Clean off, again.
Like most things in life,

126
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,957
it cannot stand
the weight of a man.

127
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,953
Here we go. Oh. God love us.

128
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,917
Hold on.

129
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,552
Thank you again, Mr...

130
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,189
Sorry to be presumptive.
Are you a Mr?

131
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,635
I'm a Charlie. From Northampton.

132
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,870
Well, I rather thought you might be.

133
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,632
<i>... my unspoiled gender</i>

134
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,280
<i>Prim and proper</i>

135
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,989
<i>The girl who's never been cased</i>

136
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:32,074
<i>I'm tired of being pure and not chased</i>

137
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,598
<i>Like something that
seeks its level</i>

138
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,749
<i>I wanna go to the devil</i>

139
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,512
<i>I wanna be evil</i>

140
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,909
<i>I wanna spit tacks</i>

141
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,558
<i>I wanna be evil</i>

142
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,551
<i>And cheat at jacks</i>

143
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,835
<i>I wanna be wicked</i>

144
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,512
<i>I wanna tell lies</i>

145
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,276
<i>I wanna be mean
and throw mud pies</i>

146
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,590
<i>I want to wake up
in the morning</i>

147
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,636
<i>With that dark brown taste</i>

148
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,679
<i>I wanna see some dissipation
in my face</i>

149
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,716
<i>I wanna be evil</i>

150
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,836
<i>I wanna be mad</i>

151
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,558
<i>But more than that</i>

152
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,234
<i>I wanna be bad</i>

153
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,995
<i>I wanna be evil
and trump an ace</i>

154
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,437
<i>Just to see my partner's face</i>

155
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,795
<i>I wanna be nasty</i>

156
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,359
<i>I wanna be cruel</i>

157
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,431
<i>I wanna be daring</i>

158
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,431
<i>I wanna shoot pool</i>

159
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,318
<i>And in the theatre</i>

160
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,470
<i>I want to change my seat</i>

161
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,759
<i>Just so I can step on
everybody's feet</i>

162
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,278
- Oh, no.
- Trish.

163
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,679
Thing is...

164
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,035
No, love, please. Please.

165
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,951
They've just started school.

166
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,634
They just started school
this month, Charlie.

167
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,190
This is their uniforms, love.
This is their dinners.

168
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,953
We lost the contract
with Chambers, Trish.

169
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,679
Thing is, we lost the
contract with Chambers...

170
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,910
Actually, don't.

171
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,719
This is like apologies
for your train running late.

172
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,155
- It means nothing...
- It's not like that...

173
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,435
...so I'd rather not hear it.

174
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,359
<i>I do mean it.</i>

175
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,993
<i>Bernie Taylor to the office.</i>

176
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,115
Please.

177
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,998
This is not what I want, Bernie.

178
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,473
I don't want to be sitting here
doing this, but you know...

179
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,554
Nine out of ten shoe factories
have shut down...

180
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,631
What can I do?

181
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,159
I am sorry it's come to this, Anthony.

182
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,229
Daphne.

183
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,355
Janice.

184
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,998
- Derek?
- Eric.

185
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,274
Yes, Eric.

186
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,315
What can I do?

187
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,913
Change the product.

188
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,468
- Sorry?
- Like Liptons.

189
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,551
Start making equestrian boots.

190
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,077
Browns. They're making...
Whatever, climbing boots.

191
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,789
All them other sods, they went out
looking for their niche markets.

192
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,158
They just didn't sit back
in their offices going, "What can I do?"

193
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,749
Sorry.

194
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,714
I was just really, really
looking forward to a Chinese tonight.

195
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,477
Now I'm not sure if I can afford it.

196
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,191
In a sense it was lucky, they hadn't
got round to advertising your job.

197
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,036
Yeah, lucky.

198
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,111
Listen, Nic.

199
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,033
That's the kind of shoe, isn't it?
Don't you think?

200
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,192
- What?
- The wedding. At the altar.

201
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,714
Is that the kind of thing
you were thinking of?

202
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,472
On my foot.

203
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,950
Well, it needs to be a Jimmy Choo,
doesn't it? To work.

204
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,315
We might have to think
about the wedding.

205
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,395
Not the wedding, wedding, but...

206
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,589
It doesn't have to be all live band
and shoes at the altar, does it?

207
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,590
I mean, at the end of the day
it's about the two of us, isn't it?

208
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,479
I've made 15 people redundant today.

209
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,873
Lauren.

210
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,520
Lauren, you haven't heard
what I was gonna say.

211
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,114
Well, does it involve the words,
"job back"?

212
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,313
Potentially.

213
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,789
OK, brace yourself.

214
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:22,399
Ladies, gentlemen and those
who are yet to make up your mind.

215
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,554
<i>Whatever Lola wants</i>

216
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,108
<i>Lola gets</i>

217
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,792
<i>And little man</i>

218
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,792
<i>Little Lola wants you</i>

219
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,434
<i>Make up your mind to have</i>

220
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,193
<i>No regrets</i>

221
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,872
<i>Recline yourself</i>

222
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,473
<i>Resign yourself</i>

223
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,834
<i>You're through</i>

224
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,791
<i>I always gain</i>

225
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,077
<i>What I aim for</i>

226
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,435
<i>And your heart and soul</i>

227
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,479
<i>Is what I came for</i>

228
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,314
<i>Whatever Lola wants</i>

229
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,630
<i>Lola gets</i>

230
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,597
<i>Take off your coat</i>

231
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,752
<i>Don't you know you can't win</i>

232
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,712
<i>You're no exception to the rule</i>

233
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,156
<i>I'm irresistible you fool</i>

234
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,435
<i>Give in</i>

235
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,239
Lola.

236
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,796
All me, sweetheart.
I design everything in that club.

237
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,989
It's my costumes, my lighting,
my dancers, my show, love.

238
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,036
I mean, it's me.

239
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,839
Bit of a dark horse, your boyfriend.

240
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,353
He's my boss.

241
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,273
Well, he was my boss.
I got laid off.

242
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,909
But now he seems to think
I'm his business analyst or...

243
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,036
Look, you'll have to excuse Charlie.

244
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,839
We don't have many transvestites
in Northampton.

245
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,275
I'm not merely a transvestite,
sweetheart.

246
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,999
I'm also a drag queen.
It's a simple equation.

247
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,356
A drag queen puts on a frock,
looks like Kylie.

248
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,671
A transvestite puts on a frock,
looks like...

249
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,115
Boris Yeltsin in lipstick.
There, I said it.

250
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,919
Ta. Whatever. Don't kid yourself.

251
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,470
You're never more than ten feet away
from a transvestite.

252
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,599
You made her redundant?
You miserable sod.

253
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,596
Things aren't very good
in men's shoes.

254
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,636
Well, I'm not, certainly.

255
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,280
Yes. Precisely.

256
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,351
How much do you weigh?

257
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,750
The right amount.
How much do you drink?

258
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:06,439
I mean... They're women's boots,
are they, that you buy?

259
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,274
You have to buy women's boots
because you...

260
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,235
You see, the distribution of pressure
on a conventional female heel

261
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,039
cannot be expected
to support a man's weight.

262
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,875
And if trans... you know, whatevers,

263
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,715
drag queens are everywhere,
like you said, then, not in a...

264
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,113
<i>Living Dead kind of way but...</i>

265
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:38,673
Then, do you think there is
a niche market for proper, good,

266
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,672
decent, built-to-last boots

267
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,912
for women... that are men?

268
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,394
All this way for my advice.
I feel like Oprah.

269
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,711
I'd like to measure you for it,
go home, make a pair.

270
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,278
Who gets to keep the boots?

271
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,115
A little warning.
The answer is, "You do, Lola."

272
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,839
You do, Lola.

273
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,310
Where do I come to pick it up?
What, Prices of Northampton, is it?

274
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,789
Yeah, but I'll come to you.

275
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,793
Oh, no. As they say, a good
pair of boots is worth walking for.

276
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,589
No, you see,
I come here all the time, and so...

277
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,670
I'll come to you.

278
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,954
Right.

279
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,350
Look behind you.

280
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,919
What? What is it?

281
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,036
It's your niche market, Charlie.

282
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,353
Big niche.

283
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,034
Ladies, gentlemen

284
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,112
and those of you
who are yet to make up your mind,

285
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,192
our very own Lola.

286
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,995
<i>He walked into my life</i>

287
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,952
<i>And now he's taking over</i>

288
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,917
<i>And it's beautiful</i>

289
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,432
<i>Yes it's beautiful</i>

290
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,232
<i>I've gone with better looking guys</i>

291
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,193
<i>He's gone with prettier looking girls</i>

292
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,595
<i>But now we're beautiful</i>

293
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,629
<i>I think we're beautiful</i>

294
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:33,480
<i>I don't need love affairs anymore</i>

295
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,993
<i>I don't need love affairs anymore</i>

296
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,038
<i>Can't you see</i>

297
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,395
<i>It's the chemistry</i>

298
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,793
<i>You really must agree
together we are beautiful</i>

299
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,033
<i>We are beautiful...</i>

300
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,954
Well?

301
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,988
Cool.

302
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,236
I was thinking, we should...

303
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,880
If you haven't got anything else on

304
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,872
then maybe you could come back to...

305
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,075
To your house?

306
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,511
The factory.

307
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,075
I'm gonna need someone on
the web to research markets and...

308
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,277
If Pat got on those websites
she'd have a heart attack.

309
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,078
Yeah.

310
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,799
Besides, you started it,
being in that strop.

311
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,112
Oh, well.
I mean, I just had the strop, Charlie.

312
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,395
You saw the idea.

313
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,996
And that is why some of us end up
with our names above the factories

314
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,674
and others just on
the clocking-in cards.

315
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,429
Right.

316
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,511
Well, as someone
with their name on a factory,

317
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,036
can I invite you to have your name
on one of my clocking-in cards?

318
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,472
They say, calm down,
they say whatever life throws at you,

319
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,471
whatever emotions you feel,

320
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,120
somebody somewhere
has written a song about it.

321
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,555
Now, I hope that'll be true.

322
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,551
Until somebody writes a song called

323
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,313
<i>No One Stays Young Forever And
One Day I Hope You Get Dumped</i>

324
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,834
<i>For A Younger Model,
You Whiny Little Welsh Bastard,</i>

325
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,150
I'm just gonna have
to sing your memory.

326
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,798
Show us your tits.

327
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,959
Certainly. Ladies and Gentleman,
there they are.

328
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,837
Give 'em a round of applause.

329
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,835
Are they as wrinkly
as your arms, love?

330
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,433
- Is there a man in there?
- Good one.

331
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:28,355
I have to tell you, sweetheart,
my breasts are as smooth and beautiful

332
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,271
as the day that I bought them.

333
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,555
Bastard.

334
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,831
Hey.

335
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,511
Forget it, Don. Out of your league.

336
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,670
Nah. You seem to forget,

337
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,752
women get turned on
by the sight of the working man.

338
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,315
Morning, Charlie.

339
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,435
Lola.

340
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,629
Come in.

341
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,071
Sorry it's a bit messy. We...

342
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,429
I thought we agreed
that I'd come to London.

343
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,511
I warn you, Charlie from Northampton,

344
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,513
I have a terrible habit of doing
the opposite of what people want.

345
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,068
Some might say
that attempts of certain people

346
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,869
to make a man out of me as a child
is the reason that I now wear a frock.

347
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,669
If I get the feeling somebody
didn't want me to come to Northampton...

348
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,591
- No.
- Also, I can tell

349
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:41,753
from years of experience when I'm
being smuggled in through a rear door.

350
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,956
- That's the rough-stuff room.
- Is it?

351
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,077
It's where we dump
all the offcuts and misshapes.

352
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,469
There you go.
I wondered why I was drawn to it.

353
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,788
- Pardon?
- Nothing.

354
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,711
I'll raise.

355
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,671
That's George.

356
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,435
Listen, Mel, all I say is,
when it comes to attracting women

357
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,511
some men don't have to speak.

358
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,551
This is cosy.

359
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,630
All right.

360
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,711
Here we are.

361
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,749
Well?

362
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,031
What do you think?

363
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,995
Burgundy.

364
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,798
Please, God, tell me
I've not inspired something burgundy.

365
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,713
Red.

366
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,629
Red.

367
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,073
Red.

368
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,030
Red. Charlie boy.

369
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,156
Rule one. Red...

370
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,593
<i>... is the colour of sex.</i>

371
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,877
Burgundy is the colour
of hot water bottles.

372
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,270
Red is the colour
of sex and fear and danger

373
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,911
and signs that say, "Do Not Enter."

374
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,639
<i>All of my favourite things in life.</i>

375
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,235
- Who's that?
- He's got your new girlfriend in there.

376
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,675
- But they're comfy.
- Comfy?

377
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,876
Sex shouldn't be comfy.

378
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,952
Thank God.
I thought it was just me.

379
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:08,192
I don't know what you're used to makin',
but now you're making sex.

380
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,989
Two-and-a-half feet
of irresistible tubular sex.

381
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,389
I mean, that heel. For God's sake.

382
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,675
It won't break.
That's what you wanted.

383
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,354
Not if it means looking like
a Ukrainian peasant.

384
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,795
It's better than flouncing around
like a...

385
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,316
You wanna show your niche market
a little more respect, Charlie.

386
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,072
- Let's ask your girls.
- No.

387
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,879
Girls. Would you wear
something like this to go out?

388
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,951
No.

389
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,270
You'd look all right in 'em, sweetheart.

390
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,919
You've pulled.

391
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,077
Oh, yeah.

392
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,999
Ladies.

393
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,872
Well, I'm very flattered.

394
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,919
But frankly,
if you can't get women to wear 'em,

395
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,195
you'll never get blokes like me
to wear 'em.

396
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,275
Do we still have a workforce?

397
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,793
Don'll come around.

398
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,791
Once he's stopped...

399
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,396
...walking up and down, swearing.

400
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,711
- Well, that's his problem.
- No, it's our problem, Lola.

401
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,509
This is Northampton.
You have no idea what it's like, OK?

402
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,034
- It's not Soho.
- Amen.

403
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,278
Look to the heel, young man.

404
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,311
The sex is in the heel.

405
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,354
What's that supposed to mean?

406
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,670
Sex is in the heel.

407
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,038
Stilettos require constant balance
from the upper leg

408
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,634
causing the muscles
of the backside to tense

409
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,553
and appear pert and ready for mating.

410
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:32,115
It's physically impossible.
I mean, am I missing something?

411
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:37,274
To make a stiletto, something that thin,
bear the weight of a man is just...

412
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,828
Steel shank.

413
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,239
What?

414
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,596
A steel shank, cut thinly,

415
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,229
then moulded in a continuous section,

416
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,675
from toe to heel without pinning.

417
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,228
Not even Don would crush that.

418
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,549
Lola.

419
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,990
Lola, we might be able to do it.

420
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,548
Steel shanks without underpinning.

421
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,756
We might be able
to make those boots.

422
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,195
If you could just...
If you're willing to...

423
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,999
I think Don would have
something to say about that.

424
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,550
I gave up the provinces years ago,
and I've just been reminded why.

425
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,676
Lola doesn't do North.

426
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,194
- Northampton's the Midlands.
- No, Charlie.

427
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,396
Tottenham Court Road is the Midlands.

428
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,233
If you'll excuse me,
I have a show tonight.

429
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,154
Look, I'm stood here, trying
to save a factory of four generations.

430
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,515
Of my father,
and his father's father...

431
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,149
- Tell me when it applies to me.
- And how it applies to you.

432
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,754
I'm about to take
an almighty fucking gamble.

433
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,070
And in one afternoon, in one drawing,

434
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,549
you've said more about
these boots than...

435
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,868
I mean, I just...

436
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,556
Five weeks, Lola. That's it. I mean,
if I don't have a new collection ready

437
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,553
for the Milan shoe fair in five weeks,
I've blown it. I'll have to sell up.

438
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,272
All right, I'll tell you what.
Don't hang around.

439
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,033
It's never gonna apply to you.

440
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,639
What you don't realise, Lola,
is this is not my world either.

441
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,514
Where you going, darling?

442
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,591
By the sound of it...

443
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,319
Milan.

444
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,840
I see this as a very positive step
for a company,

445
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,037
who spent the last century
making a range of shoes for men,

446
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:54,150
to start the next century
making shoes for a range of men.

447
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,279
Any questions?

448
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,948
Sorry, love. I thought you were
going in to work at nine.

449
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,429
No, I did, Mrs Cobb, I was.

450
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,273
- I am.
- Sorry.

451
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,909
Don.

452
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,875
Have you got
any toilets down here?

453
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,428
I'm afraid we've only got
men's and women's.

454
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,153
Charlie.
She's locked herself in the loo.

455
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,958
- What?
- Come on.

456
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,477
Right. Go in there. Tell her...

457
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,358
- No, the gent's loo.
- Right.

458
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,551
What's up, Mel?

459
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,959
Lola, it's Charlie. Are you OK?

460
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,159
Are you ill?

461
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,151
Yeah, I'm sick.

462
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,312
- Ask your boys.
- Oh, God. Is this Don?

463
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,151
Has he nicked your dress?

464
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,871
I came like this.

465
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,515
God. Put on a frock,

466
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,593
<i>and I can sing Stand By Your Man
in front of 500 strangers.</i>

467
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,229
Put on a pair of jeans, and I can't even
sodding well say hello.

468
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:06,956
I have to say,
I was going to suggest dressing down.

469
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,951
Well, thank you for your concern.

470
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,235
Come on, tell me.

471
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,351
- Boxer.
- Get out of here.

472
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,591
I'm serious.
He had me doing training.

473
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,639
Weights. I could bench-press 93 kilos.

474
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,872
I owe all my spectacular
muscle definition to my father.

475
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,793
What, he never...
The whole wearing frocks thing...

476
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,472
Well, he wasn't stupid.

477
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,519
He knew there'd be few cross-dressing
heavyweight champions of the world.

478
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,431
Yeah.

479
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,356
No, he disowned me.

480
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,516
Wouldn't see me.

481
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,473
Even when he got lung cancer,
he wouldn't.

482
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,076
So, it's ironic really.

483
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,830
Fags got him in the end.

484
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,950
I mean, that's what it was all about.

485
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,196
Fitting in.

486
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,238
Melding in. Not standing out.

487
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,193
As far as he was concerned, if you're
big, black and a boxer you are sorted.

488
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,158
If you're big and you're black
and you're in a...

489
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,119
you know... strapless cocktail dress,
that's not so good.

490
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,634
That's what my dad wanted, an' all.

491
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,676
A strapless cocktail dress?

492
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,912
No. For me to fit in.
To this place.

493
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,952
You know, it should be me
that's hiding in here, not you.

494
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,271
I'm the one who doesn't know
what he's doing.

495
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,716
God, it'd kill him
to hear me say that, too.

496
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,031
Although he probably knew,
and that's probably what did.

497
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,075
Well.

498
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,757
Perhaps we just have to pretend
we do know what we're doing.

499
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:27,478
Charlie from Northampton,
Simon from Clacton.

500
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,831
Come on, let's make boots.

501
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,908
Cover me, girls. I'm going in.

502
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,634
For...

503
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,110
<i>While tearing off</i>

504
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,589
<i>A game of golf</i>

505
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,071
<i>I might make a play
for the caddie</i>

506
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,276
<i>But when I do</i>

507
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,920
<i>I don't follow through</i>

508
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,313
<i>Cos my heart belongs to Daddy</i>

509
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,709
<i>If I invite</i>

510
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,109
<i>A boy some night</i>

511
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,159
<i>To dine on my fine finnan haddie</i>

512
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,834
<i>Though I just adore</i>

513
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,832
<i>His asking for more</i>

514
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:07,948
<i>But my heart belongs to Daddy</i>

515
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,030
That's where you applaud, Charlie.

516
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,913
Don't you have a show tonight?

517
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,270
Sore throat.

518
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,271
<i>But my heart...</i>

519
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:40,832
You know you don't have to work
in the rough-stuff room.

520
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,831
But I feel at home here.

521
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,515
They're my friends.

522
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:52,311
Besides, one never knows what joy
one might find amongst the unwanted.

523
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,349
And abandoned.

524
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,233
Charlie boy.

525
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,111
Morning, stranger.

526
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,638
Nic, look, about last night.

527
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,989
Things got a little bit crazy
at work and...

528
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,799
It won't always be like that.
I promise.

529
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,351
- No, really, it won't be.
- OK.

530
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,671
See, I think I've found
a solution for the factory.

531
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:47,276
Well, that makes two of us.
Come on.

532
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,590
One second, Mrs Cobb.

533
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,189
God.

534
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,474
Come in.

535
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,319
- There we go.
- Thank you.

536
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,119
And the room's all right
for you then, love, is it?

537
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:10,159
Absolutely lovely, Mrs Cobb, yes.
Lots of...

538
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,798
Lots of trinkets.

539
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,759
Now, the little pottery shoes,
they're good luck, you see?

540
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:19,230
You know, like Whitby
has lucky glass ducks,

541
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,754
Northampton has lucky pottery shoes.

542
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,229
Can I just ask, are you a man?

543
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,989
I am, love, yes.

544
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:32,789
That's fine. Just so's I know
how to leave the toilet seat.

545
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,075
I'll get some biscuits.

546
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,468
Mr Price.

547
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,312
Charlie, this is Richard Bailey

548
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,914
I was sorry to hear about your dad.

549
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,672
Shall we?

550
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,876
The beauty is the building.

551
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,430
For us developers,
it's more a case of what we don't do.

552
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,318
- Isn't it?
- And if you look in here,

553
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,437
you will see the bedroom.

554
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,034
So, what do you think?

555
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,032
We... I mean, one day, Nic,

556
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:44,513
if this is what you want, but isn't it
slightly out of our price range?

557
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,673
Not all buildings deserve
a second life, Mr Price,

558
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:58,471
but factories like this,
like yours, they're special.

559
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,036
Sorry?

560
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,237
Are you under the illusion
that Prices is for sale?

561
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,392
I know you're trying to help
but if you hang in there a bit,

562
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,799
I make you this promise.

563
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,030
A promise like the Jimmy Choo shoes?

564
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,078
Hang on. You're talking about
the history of my family.

565
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,549
But isn't this the future of it
right here?

566
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,358
I don't know, Nicola. Is it?

567
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,079
I mean, if I can't get you
to summon up some faith...

568
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,870
OK, give me it, Charlie. Come on.
What have I got to have faith in?

569
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,155
Now, I've suggested selling the factory

570
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,674
to a brilliant developer
who's interested.

571
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,274
And who's done all that.
You know?

572
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:42,114
Made all that happen.
What's your plan?

573
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,519
Charlie boy.

574
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,034
I've found Soho.

575
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,112
A little corner of Soho in Northampton,
that brasserie.

576
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,509
We're not talking Hoxton,
but never mind.

577
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,957
Sorry, I'm Lola. I'm the one designing
his range of transvestite boots.

578
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:07,398
There's a slight chill in the air.

579
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,471
Isn't there?

580
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,115
That is the...

581
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,270
- Plan.
- Yeah.

582
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,954
Listen, Nic,
I have not gone into this lightly.

583
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,712
And there is a market...

584
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,110
Can I just say
before you make a fool of yourself

585
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,875
trying to save the factory because,
"It's the history of my family",

586
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,748
the reason Richard came to see me,
OK, not you,

587
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,593
was because your dad approached him
about selling.

588
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,557
You see, you owe your father nothing,
Charlie Price.

589
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,275
You are free.

590
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,032
To walk.

591
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,158
Right. That's it.

592
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,755
We've terminated production
on all Derbys, brogues and Oxfords.

593
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,991
From now on, the factory
is 100 percent on the new range.

594
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,479
Or we will not hit Milan.

595
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,791
So, we need at least
fifteen new designs from Lola.

596
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,996
And at least six samples of each.

597
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,638
And remember.

598
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,393
You are not making footwear.

599
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,789
You are not making boots.

600
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:30,228
You are making two-and-a-half feet
of irresistible, tubular sex.

601
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,357
None of the major firms
just take a stand.

602
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,149
All the big boys hire the main runway,
so we will need that.

603
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,596
I mean, we need Milan to go like, pow.

604
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,274
Like the two of did
that night at The Angel, yeah?

605
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,033
I mean we need to take
The Angel Club to Milan.

606
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,680
We will take
The Angel Club to Milan.

607
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,036
Well, you wouldn't put a frock on.

608
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:01,317
If you don't want to get off
with blokes, why put a frock on?

609
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,756
Thing is, Mike, ask any woman
what she likes most in a man.

610
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:10,198
Compassion, tenderness, sensitivity.
Traditionally the female virtues.

611
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:15,638
Perhaps what women secretly desire
is a man who is fundamentally a woman.

612
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,876
- He's coming.
- Right.

613
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,038
Hello, Don. Tell me,
what do you think I could do

614
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,429
that would make me more of a man?

615
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,397
Look, a piece of paper down here.

616
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,677
Why not write down what you think
would make me more of a man

617
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,230
and I'll write down what I think
would make you more of a man?

618
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,153
If I do what's on yours,
you do what's on mine, right?

619
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,953
Piss off.

620
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,555
Fine.

621
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,919
So, is our Don a man, do you think?

622
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,036
Well, he dresses like one.

623
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,550
- Good answer.
- I was pleased with it.

624
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,631
Great, love. Go home.

625
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,916
Come on, Don. Be a man.

626
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,389
- You don't have to do this.
- I do. You know why?

627
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,916
Cos what Don's written on my paper
is a bloody walk in the park

628
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,638
compared to what I've written.

629
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,598
We've 24 hours.
I could do without industrial unrest.

630
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,716
Calm down, it's not boxing.

631
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,919
Sorry.

632
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,873
Play.

633
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,273
So, the...

634
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,351
Yeah, well...

635
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,518
Why'd you stop?

636
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,115
I wouldn't want you
to walk into the factory

637
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:35,237
and feel that people
didn't respect you, Don.

638
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:38,551
I wouldn't want anyone else
to know what that feels like.

639
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,195
Change your mind about someone.

640
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,831
Nice one, champ.
Get the beers in?

641
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,512
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

642
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,236
Oh, Christ.

643
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:36,277
How much does that buy us?

644
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:39,397
The main runway,
from between 4.30 to 5.00.

645
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,835
After Closerie and before Tricker's.

646
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:53,758
OK. Hi. Listen, I'm sorry.
We can't afford it.

647
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,910
Just...

648
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,198
- How much for the dancers?
- Well all this is Lola's estimate

649
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,271
for the Blue Angel boys and expenses.

650
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,237
Could you get it for under 20,000?

651
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,515
- Well, why 20?
- Could you?

652
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,989
- Why 20?
- Because that is what the bank

653
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,116
will give me against my house.

654
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,474
<i>Hello?</i>

655
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,189
What?

656
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:21,192
<i>- Take it.
- Pronto.</i>

657
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,831
At least one Mr Price didn't sit around
saying, "What can I do?"

658
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:26,909
Take it.

659
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,629
Come on.
Tea break finished five minutes ago.

660
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,711
Come on, you know where that goes.

661
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,318
How are you getting on, George?

662
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:46,077
Why, it's surprisingly easy
if I just imagine Pat wearing 'em.

663
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,438
Is it?

664
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:54,231
George. There's an indentation
in the leather. Bin it. Do it again.

665
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,436
I don't care, redo it.

666
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:59,114
- What if they're not assembled?
- They will be.

667
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,872
It's four o'clock.

668
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,679
They'll have to work over.
This is bloody Milan.

669
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,751
You don't get marks for effort.

670
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:12,359
Caffeine. Give us a hand, would you?

671
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,590
I needed a break
from Mr Shouty back there.

672
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,432
He's just tense, all right?

673
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:21,149
What?

674
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,117
Are you aware that you do that?

675
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,395
That you instinctively defend him?

676
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,511
Look at those puppies.

677
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:34,518
You know,
Charlie's dad used to have this theory

678
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:37,910
that you could tell everything
about a person from their shoes.

679
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,918
- Right. Come on, then.
- Oh, no.

680
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,555
Cheap but happy.

681
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,358
Very eager to please.

682
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,908
All right, all right.
Those, those, look.

683
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,197
Shiny but dull.

684
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,228
Oh, my God.

685
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,914
- Hello, Lauren.
- Hello, Nicola.

686
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,991
I love those shoes.

687
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,954
- Charlie's treat?
- Yeah, once upon a time.

688
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,359
What?

689
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:15,000
A girl can live with so many
once-upon-a-times

690
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:17,355
before she finally
has to buy them herself.

691
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,635
It's not like that with the factory,
is it?

692
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,153
- Sorry?
- Well, Charlie.

693
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:24,277
He said he was gonna save it.
Most guys would have gone,

694
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,316
"Hey, what can I do?"

695
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,756
Fallen at the first hurdle,
let alone remortgage their house.

696
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,796
You should see him in that factory.

697
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,189
It's like it's made him
twice as determined.

698
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,670
I'm sorry. Remortgaged the... what?

699
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,516
How are we?

700
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,672
No.

701
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,672
For God's sake, Melanie.
This is Milan.

702
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,752
These seams aren't straight.
You're rushing it.

703
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,235
Pardon?

704
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:03,153
You're gonna have to unpick
all this and start again.

705
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:06,312
Thought that might...
This is Saturday.

706
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,392
- You've got enough completed.
- No, I haven't.

707
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,948
Some of us have got
a life outside this factory.

708
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,713
You're gonna have
a bloody lot more of it in a bit.

709
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:20,273
Mel, you don't understand.
This is Milan.

710
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:24,911
It's Mil...
How do you know what Milan is?

711
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,912
You don't know. You're guessing.

712
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,070
Perhaps you'd have it finished by now

713
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:35,518
if you hadn't made us
undo every single bloody stitch.

714
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,556
But, Mel, they weren't good enough.

715
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,757
- They were good enough for your dad.
- But I'm not my dad.

716
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,479
Hey. I'll tell you what, Charlie Price.

717
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:46,472
Never a bloody truer word.

718
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:50,519
Mel. We have to leave
at six in the morning. Please.

719
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,591
A word, Charlie.

720
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,917
I'm actually in a bit of a crisis here.

721
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,199
I think so.

722
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,319
Is it not bad enough
you're making this kind of crap

723
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,231
thinking you'll save the factory?

724
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:09,515
But the fact
you remortgaged the house...

725
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,319
- What?
- Charlie, Lauren didn't realise.

726
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:17,875
Our house. No one will ever say
I didn't stand by my man, Charlie.

727
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:22,988
I've done it. I'll stand by you now.
Just... a reason.

728
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,913
- Nicola.
- Give me a reason.

729
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,798
- Down there.
- Looking at you, Charlie Price.

730
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,950
Give me a reason. Standing here.

731
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,510
Making porn-wear for hermaphrodites.

732
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,717
Hermaphrodites have both sets
of reproductive organs.

733
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,233
Get out.

734
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:51,668
Where was it for London?
All this money?

735
01:09:55,440 --> 01:10:00,116
Don't. Flat the size of a postage stamp,
because we have to be careful, Nic,

736
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,795
- but hey bloody presto...
- London was for you.

737
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:06,712
London was for us.

738
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,598
You wouldn't spend
another five grand on us,

739
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:13,753
but you'll bloody remortgage the house
to keep people we don't know in a job.

740
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,354
I do know them.
It's you that doesn't know them.

741
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,635
Because you never come in here.

742
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:24,590
I've already had to fire 15 of them and
they were the 15 worst times of my life.

743
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,272
- So sell it.
- Nicola.

744
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,555
I don't...

745
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,438
<i>Do they know
your dad was gonna sell up?</i>

746
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,274
You know? Even your dad.
Have you told them that?

747
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,351
I don't care what he was gonna do.

748
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:40,000
I don't care
that he was gonna sell the place.

749
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,036
OK. I, here, me, now. Charlie Price,

750
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,953
doesn't actually enjoy
making people redundant.

751
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,635
<i>And if you can't hear a reason yet,
then maybe you won't ever get it.</i>

752
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:50,995
Maybe you won't ever get me.

753
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:55,039
Maybe Nicola Marsden
will never ever quite get Charlie Price.

754
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:02,317
Maybe I won't.

755
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,315
Oh, sod it.

756
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:09,155
It's probably my fault. Putting Dad up,
making some hero out of him.

757
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,629
You shouldn't do that.

758
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:16,350
I suppose I just didn't wanna be
the last photo in the line, you know?

759
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,079
The Price who left nothing.

760
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:22,277
Maybe you shouldn't
judge it in bricks, Charlie.

761
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:24,954
Maybe you judge
what you leave behind

762
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,156
by what you inspire in other people.

763
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:41,869
Charlie?

764
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,275
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me please.

765
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,351
Coming through.

766
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,871
Coffee? Cup of tea?

767
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:01,753
Charlie.

768
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,308
Did you get them to do this?

769
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:08,154
Rather rose to the challenge
of changing his mind about someone.

770
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:09,309
You?

771
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:12,073
No, Charlie. You.

772
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,511
Here we go.

773
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:29,676
My God.

774
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:35,312
Hey, everyone.
The man from Milan, he say yes.

775
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,076
Cheers.

776
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:41,594
- Come on, Lauren.
- No.

777
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,960
He's had quite an impact
on us girls, hasn't he?

778
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,791
Charlie Price.

779
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,711
I saw a documentary once.

780
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:12,475
Potholers. They'd have a celebration
the night before they went down

781
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,471
in case they never came out.

782
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,233
Of course, now Northampton
is the perfect venue.

783
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:20,357
- I...
- A little warning.

784
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,396
The answer is, "I'd love to, Lola."

785
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,593
Stop it.

786
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,718
- Table for one?
- For two.

787
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,519
- Two. Right here.
- I'll just use your toilet.

788
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:43,194
Toilets, yes,
just down the stairs on the left.

789
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:53,595
Richard.

790
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:54,749
Oh, Christ.

791
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,239
It's Charlie Price.

792
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:59,118
Oh, no. Absolutely. From Prices, yeah.

793
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,836
Didn't expect to see you at La Conceria.

794
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,354
Not one of your normal haunts this,
is it?

795
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,829
We're having a meeting.
It's about business.

796
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:12,356
Business? God.
Never lets up, does it? Same with me.

797
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,596
They're running away.

798
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,916
Charlie boy.

799
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,991
Sorry I'm late.
You know how it is.

800
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,878
I'm sitting with all my dresses
on my bed, thinking,

801
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,839
"Is it hot in Milan? Is it cool?
Does it get cold at night?"

802
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:20,430
Thank you.

803
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:23,273
You couldn't get me a Bloody Mary,
could you?

804
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,713
Bloody Mary for the lady.

805
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:27,109
The whole potholing thing,
I didn't mean it.

806
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:30,397
I don't think it will go tits up.
I mean, the show. The routine.

807
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,278
Wait till you see what
I have planned for the catwalk.

808
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,191
- If we market it...
- Lola.

809
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,795
It's not just us who'll go for 'em.
There's a whole club scene...

810
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,713
- Stop.
- What?

811
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,519
People are staring.
Come on, what do you want?

812
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,670
I don't think anybody's staring.

813
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:49,718
You are a man in a frock in Northampton.
They're staring.

814
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:52,394
Even if they're not looking,
they're staring.

815
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,834
I'm a Northampton shoe designer,
Charlie.

816
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:01,833
Yeah, You're that as well.
You're also a man in a dress.

817
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,753
You make it sound as if I put this on

818
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:08,549
because of the lack
of a pair of trousers.

819
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:11,916
Is there a part of you
that actually believes that, Charlie?

820
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,709
I don't know why you wear dresses
and I don't think you do either.

821
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,829
I didn't realise
I was causing you trouble.

822
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,912
Forget it. All right.
You are a very good designer.

823
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,037
You'd like me to come and design
then disappear when I'm me.

824
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:33,557
You is the designer. This is not you.
This is you in a dress, looking daft.

825
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:36,029
You don't have to.
I don't know what you think.

826
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,634
If this is about dodging
what sex you get off on...

827
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:41,154
If you think you are
somehow being mystical,

828
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:45,233
being the best of either sex,
I have to tell you, Simon...

829
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,911
Simon.

830
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,949
Stood there in a frock right now
you look like the worst bits of both.

831
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:13,119
Stop hiding. Be brave.
Decide one way or the other.

832
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,231
For my sake, tomorrow, please,

833
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,118
turn up looking like
the picture on your passport.

834
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,468
I can't change what I want, Charlie.

835
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,549
I cannot change what I want.

836
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,192
I can't do that.

837
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,154
George.

838
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,629
Hey. No Lola.

839
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:28,992
- George.
- Mr Price.

840
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,593
Are we all set?

841
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,511
Did she say she was gonna be late?

842
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:37,549
No, actually she said
she was gonna fly out with the girls.

843
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:40,598
- What, from London?
- Lola.

844
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:44,630
Funny, isn't it?
They look quite dead like this.

845
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:48,110
Don't worry, George.
It'll be a different story tomorrow.

846
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:55,352
Look. That's us.
The Milan main catwalk.

847
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:59,834
The Angel girls
wearing our boys, eh, Charlie?

848
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:24,033
You know, as Lola would say, there's
a slight chill in the air, Charlie.

849
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:31,071
- And I'm getting worried...
- I had an argument with her.

850
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:33,310
- What?
- With Lola.

851
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:36,198
Last night in the restaurant. See...

852
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:40,592
She turned up in a dress and I just...

853
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:49,072
She didn't go to London, did she?

854
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,511
She didn't get on a plane at all.

855
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:58,230
Lauren. There was a bloke
that wanted to buy the factory.

856
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,835
Richard Bailey. He was with Nicola
at the restaurant and I just...

857
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:03,592
All that does not apply to me.

858
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:06,717
What applies is that there is
nobody here to wear our boots

859
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,837
that we have worked our arses off
to get here, Charlie.

860
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,070
OK. I... Yes, I am sorry,

861
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:15,197
but it's just I felt
somehow useless as a man.

862
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:25,229
Sitting there in the restaurant,
I felt somehow useless as a man.

863
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,319
So here we are again.

864
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:35,313
Charlie Price, standing in front of me,

865
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:41,037
saying, "It's not my fault.
What can I do?"

866
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,471
<i>- Hello, this is Lola.
- Lola.</i>

867
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,916
<i>I'm not here now. Well, I am
here, but you know what to do.</i>

868
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:11,916
Lola, when you pick this up,
this is a Charlie from Northampton.

869
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:58,034
OK, we have the exhibitors, please?
For Prices?

870
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,114
That's me.

871
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,316
And the dressers?

872
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:04,435
That's me.

873
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,033
The models?

874
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,720
That's you as well, isn't it?

875
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:20,992
George. OK, he's all set.
He looks fantastic.

876
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,755
<i>- ... Prices.
- Go.</i>

877
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:28,992
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen, please take
your seats for the Prices collection.</i>

878
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:31,116
Does he look sexy?

879
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,398
He does to me, George.

880
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:49,274
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen, please take
your seats for the Prices collection.</i>

881
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:58,398
OK? OK.

882
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,190
This is it, it's you, Mr Price.

883
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:21,548
Shit.

884
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:00,309
<i>You keep lying</i>

885
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,709
<i>When you oughta be truthin'</i>

886
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,949
<i>And you keep losin'
when you oughta not bet</i>

887
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:13,636
<i>You keep samin'
when you oughta be changin'</i>

888
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:15,039
<i>Now what's right is right</i>

889
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:17,554
<i>But you ain't been right yet</i>

890
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:21,320
<i>These boots are made for walking</i>

891
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:24,073
<i>And that's just what they'll do</i>

892
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:28,631
<i>One of these days these boots
are gonna walk all over you</i>

893
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:37,752
<i>I once met a man
with a sense of adventure</i>

894
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:39,353
<i>He was dressed to thrill</i>

895
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,078
<i>Wherever he went</i>

896
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:45,153
<i>He said,
"Let's make love on a mountain top"</i>

897
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:47,834
<i>"Under the stars, on a big hard rock"</i>

898
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,512
<i>I said, "In these shoes?"</i>

899
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:52,158
<i>"I don't think so"</i>

900
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:53,719
<i>Here I am looking for crime</i>

901
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,392
<i>I'm looking for some action</i>

902
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:57,436
<i>What I have a million times</i>

903
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:59,556
<i>Will give you satisfaction</i>

904
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:01,358
<i>So don't you mess around with me</i>

905
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:02,998
<i>You won't know what to do</i>

906
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:04,672
<i>Cos I'll put on my cha cha heels</i>

907
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:06,591
<i>And walk all over you</i>

908
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:09,911
<i>Gimme gimme cha cha heels</i>

909
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:14,039
<i>All I want is cha cha heels</i>

910
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:17,715
<i>Gimme gimme cha cha heels</i>

911
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:22,078
<i>If I don't get my cha cha heels
I'll walk all over you</i>

912
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:26,633
<i>Zippin' up my boots</i>

913
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:31,637
<i>Goin' back to my roots, yeah</i>

914
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:34,476
<i>To the place of my birth</i>

915
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:38,316
<i>Back down to earth</i>

916
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:46,392
<i>I'm homeward bound
Got my head turned around</i>

917
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:48,118
<i>Zippin' up my boots</i>

918
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:51,915
<i>Goin' back to my roots</i>

919
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,597
Come on, Lauren.

920
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:25,478
Stand by your man, Lauren.

921
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:29,037
Thank you.

922
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:13,396
<i>Lola, this is a Charlie
from Northampton.</i>

923
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:18,031
<i>I'm looking at a shoe fair programme
with a big gap where you should be.</i>

924
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:20,076
<i>But I have to say,
unlike most people,</i>

925
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:22,310
<i>wherever you leave,
you leave a gap, Lola.</i>

926
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:26,916
<i>You will in Northampton.
You have in Milan.</i>

927
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,833
<i>Listen, if people ever tell you,
you look half a man,</i>

928
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,956
<i>you gotta remember, that's fine.</i>

929
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:34,031
<i>I mean,
I don't know what half a man is.</i>

930
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:36,873
<i>I don't know what the hell a man is.</i>

931
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:40,191
<i>But I know that
if it involves being brave,</i>

932
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:45,274
<i>you are more of a man than
I will ever be. Goodbye, Lola.</i>

933
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:58,998
Don't think that's why I came.

934
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:00,957
I came for the adulation.

935
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:21,436
Why am I leaving you?

936
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:25,390
I'm afraid in life,

937
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:29,155
Lola has always been drawn
to the most exciting,

938
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:31,754
the most daring,

939
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:35,355
the most sexy.

940
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:41,228
There is tell of a mystical place,
far north of here,

941
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:43,880
called Northampton.

942
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:48,549
Exciting, because
it contains a shoe factory

943
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:51,996
struggling to survive
against all the odds.

944
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:57,029
Daring, because it's run
by a man brave enough to recognise

945
01:35:57,120 --> 01:36:01,272
that a factory is its people,
not its bricks.

946
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:06,480
And sexy,
well, because now I work there.

947
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:10,388
And the craftsmen of fantasy,

948
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:15,508
for ladies, gentleman,
and those of you who are yet...

949
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:17,591
...to make up your minds.

950
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:22,754
Tonight I give you,
the Kinky Boot Factory.

951
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:40,711
<i>Yes sir I can boogie</i>

952
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:44,349
<i>If you stay you can't go wrong</i>

953
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:46,317
<i>I can boogie</i>

954
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,231
<i>Boogie woogie</i>

955
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:52,677
<i>All night long</i>

956
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:59,393
<i>No sir, I don't feel
very much like talking</i>

957
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:02,472
<i>No neither walking</i>

958
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:05,677
<i>You want to know if I can dance</i>

959
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:14,319
<i>Yes sir,
already told you in the first verse</i>

960
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:17,437
<i>And in the chorus</i>

961
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:20,796
<i>But I will give you
one more chance</i>

962
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:26,237
<i>Yes sir I can boogie</i>

963
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:29,869
<i>But I need a certain song</i>

964
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:31,757
<i>I can boogie</i>

965
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,637
<i>Boogie woogie</i>

966
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:38,191
<i>All night long</i>

967
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:41,078
<i>Yes sir I can boogie</i>

968
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:44,869
<i>If you stay you can't go wrong</i>

969
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,951
<i>I can boogie</i>

970
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,632
<i>Boogie woogie</i>

971
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:53,191
<i>All night long</i>

972
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:56,317
<i>Yes sir I can boogie</i>

973
01:37:56,400 --> 01:38:00,188
<i>But I need a certain song</i>

974
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:01,952
<i>I can boogie</i>

975
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:03,837
<i>Boogie woogie</i>

976
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:08,118
<i>All night long</i>
