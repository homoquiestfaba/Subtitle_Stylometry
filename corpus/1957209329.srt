1
00:00:49,086 --> 00:00:51,253
(sighing)

2
00:03:21,544 --> 00:03:22,377
- Thanks.

3
00:03:26,947 --> 00:03:29,190
- What the hell is she doing fishing?

4
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,050
- It's okay.

5
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,063
Leave her alone.

6
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,300
- It's your daughter.

7
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,153
Let's go!

8
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,360
- [George] Mornin'.

9
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,160
- [Tom] Mornin', George.

10
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,093
- Hey, I wanted to say
sorry again, for your loss.

11
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,850
He was a great man, he was great to me.

12
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,683
- How's Reese?

13
00:04:14,683 --> 00:04:16,440
- He's a good baby, good kid.

14
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,600
Come by and see him, huh?

15
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,750
- Yeah, we oughta get
a beer some time, man.

16
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,803
It's been way too long.

17
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,293
- Let's do that.
- All right.

18
00:04:44,657 --> 00:04:48,269
(baby vocalizing)

19
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:49,102
- Hey.

20
00:04:50,446 --> 00:04:51,380
Hey.

21
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,774
Oh, you got my hair. (laughs)

22
00:04:53,774 --> 00:04:55,450
- [George] Hey, I got breakfast.

23
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,861
- [Kim] Okay, thank you.

24
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:57,916
(laughing)

25
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,250
You're so silly.

26
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,460
- [George] You sure you
don't want me to take you?

27
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,745
- No, Dad, no special treatment, okay?

28
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:06,960
(shouting playfully)

29
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,670
I left a list on the fridge with

30
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,891
feeding times and nap times.

31
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:13,203
- Hey, hey, I raised two kids.

32
00:05:14,037 --> 00:05:16,046
We got this, right?

33
00:05:16,046 --> 00:05:17,610
We got this.

34
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,495
- Bye, time for Mommy to go.

35
00:05:19,495 --> 00:05:24,495
Bye, I love you. (laughs)

36
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,209
(grunting)

37
00:06:26,977 --> 00:06:28,549
- Combine's clean.

38
00:06:28,549 --> 00:06:30,542
- (sighs) I'll be in my studio.

39
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:33,060
- Aub, can you pick me up some new gloves?

40
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,460
- Yeah, they're on the list.

41
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,533
- Thanks.

42
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,280
- You stink.

43
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,630
Did you sweep up the chaff?

44
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,053
- No.

45
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,390
I'll do it in the morning.

46
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,290
- All we need is for someone
to slip and break their neck.

47
00:06:59,147 --> 00:07:00,998
You see the paper?

48
00:07:00,998 --> 00:07:02,143
- No, why?

49
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,830
- Our greedy township supervisors

50
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,283
have started issuing drilling permits.

51
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:27,683
- Hey, Jill.

52
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,290
We need a little help
with these hospital bills.

53
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,883
Yes, we, me and Kim, your daughter.

54
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,670
Well, the garage has just
been, will you let me talk?

55
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,950
- Why do you even bother calling her, Dad?

56
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,460
- [George] Okay, the garage
has been a little bit slow.

57
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,293
No.

58
00:07:44,293 --> 00:07:45,580
- She doesn't give a shit.

59
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,120
- Right, yeah, no, of course not.

60
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,953
'Cause we all just can't get up

61
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:52,208
and leave whenever we
fucking want, can we, Jill?

62
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:55,041
(baby vocalizing)

63
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,137
(sighing)

64
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,570
- Okay, so that's five.

65
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,550
Here ya go.

66
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,520
- Okay.
- Thank you.

67
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,710
Have a great day.

68
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,543
- Thank you.

69
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,560
- Hey, George.

70
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,700
- Hey.

71
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,211
I got you all finished up.

72
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:43,142
Here.

73
00:09:43,142 --> 00:09:44,659
You know what, if you wanna pay cash

74
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:47,040
I'll knock another 10% off that.

75
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,873
Yeah.

76
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,590
- George, what the hell?

77
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,280
- Oh, yeah, I noticed that your
rear brakes needed replaced.

78
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,970
- Okay, but you told me $25.

79
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,650
- Well, yeah, for the inspection.

80
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,210
But then I have to do the emissions,

81
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,750
that's 35, that's outta my hands,

82
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,103
and, like I said, your
rear brakes were low.

83
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,563
- Okay.

84
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,000
Low enough to not pass inspection?

85
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,410
- Practically.

86
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,200
Look, I charged you 100 bucks for that,

87
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,340
and that's a big discount,
and I saved you a trip.

88
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,490
You woulda been back here in two months.

89
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,740
- You know what, George?

90
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,163
Just cut the bullshit.

91
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:29,153
I can do $50 cash, that's it.

92
00:10:31,412 --> 00:10:32,343
- I got a family.

93
00:10:33,826 --> 00:10:35,073
- Take it or leave it.

94
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,330
Or I'm gonna report you.

95
00:10:55,818 --> 00:10:57,985
(sighing)

96
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,763
- Let me try.

97
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,233
- Make sure it's good and tight.

98
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,333
That cover comes loose in the field,

99
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,770
and you're gonna lose another

100
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,330
whole day of work.
- I've done this before.

101
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,253
- Yeah, you have.

102
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:23,060
Up and down the back 40
all night searching for it.

103
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,184
- [Tom] Fuck!

104
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,650
- Weather reports say
we're not gonna get a break

105
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,223
from this heat any time soon.

106
00:11:35,586 --> 00:11:36,550
(sighs)

107
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,263
God help us if we get another
weak yield this season.

108
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,203
- God ain't gonna do shit, Mom.

109
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,274
I'm telling you, we gotta
go big or we gotta get out.

110
00:11:54,274 --> 00:11:56,560
(Kathryn sighs)

111
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,553
More field corn, maybe even soybeans,

112
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,085
otherwise we're gonna have a For Sale sign

113
00:12:02,085 --> 00:12:03,413
on our field next.

114
00:12:03,413 --> 00:12:04,773
- Don't you dare say that!

115
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,220
If your Daddy heard you say that he'd--

116
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,360
- Dad wouldn't have
driven by George's farm

117
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,163
every day without making an offer.

118
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,870
- Make an offer, with what?

119
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,459
We haven't even recouped our losses

120
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:19,020
from shuttin' down dairy production.

121
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:22,550
- Sellin' the cows was
the best idea we ever had!

122
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,903
And it's not enough!

123
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,073
It's still not enough!

124
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,227
- If you spent as much time
workin' as you did bitchin'!

125
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,160
- Wait.

126
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,110
Stay in that light.

127
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,733
- I always wanted to be a model.

128
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:50,133
Isn't that silly?

129
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,190
I wonder what Joe wanted to be?

130
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,010
- He told me when he
got out of the service

131
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,810
buying this land was the first
thing he and Kathryn did.

132
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,313
I guess farming was in their DNA.

133
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,053
Not so much for others.

134
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,903
- Every family has its problems.

135
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,980
Tom and his folks were really good

136
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,653
to us when we needed it most.

137
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,900
But we're just in a rough patch, is all.

138
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,660
- Mom, I've given a lotta
years of my life to this farm.

139
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,023
I stayed and I took care of Joe.

140
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,520
But you're the one that
married Tom, not me.

141
00:14:42,194 --> 00:14:43,027
Thanks.

142
00:15:21,642 --> 00:15:23,225
- Need a ride home?

143
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,900
- [Heather] Hey, Dad.

144
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,350
- Hey!

145
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,910
About gave me a heart attack.

146
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,100
You gonna stay for the weekend?

147
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,280
- Yeah, I had a friend drop me off.

148
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,550
I wanted to see Reesey.

149
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,000
- Great, glad you're here.

150
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,250
Just grabbed some bagels.

151
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,350
- Gotta catch the bus!

152
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,489
Good thing Heather was
here, where were you?

153
00:16:20,489 --> 00:16:24,630
- I was just up at the garage working.

154
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,660
Here, you wanna grab
a bagel before you go?

155
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,930
Here.

156
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,363
- Say bye to Mama.

157
00:16:31,812 --> 00:16:33,950
- Hey, you want one of these?

158
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:34,867
- I'm good.

159
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,520
- Hey, Billy, George Lomack callin'.

160
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,370
Hope, uh, hope this finds you guys well.

161
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,313
I was looking through my book,

162
00:17:17,313 --> 00:17:18,990
and I saw that you're a little behind

163
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,630
on your annual auto inspection.

164
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,610
Thought you might wanna get out here

165
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,560
and get somethin' on the books.

166
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,750
So give me a call if you do.

167
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,950
Again, hope you're well.

168
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,340
- [Recording] We're sorry, your call.

169
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,663
- DJ, hey, how you guys doin', huh?

170
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,214
She did, yeah, yeah, she's doin' good.

171
00:17:49,214 --> 00:17:50,864
Oh, he's great, yeah, it's a boy.

172
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,220
Reese. (chuckles)

173
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,289
Yeah, well, hey listen I
was goin' through my book,

174
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:59,370
and I see that you're about
due for your inspection

175
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,900
so do you want to make an
appointment and get in here,

176
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,250
and get that taken care of?

177
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,483
You did.

178
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,940
Hey, DJ, it's a pretty
big chain, you know.

179
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,390
They're not gonna give
you the personal service

180
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,223
that I would.

181
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,693
Yeah.

182
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:23,430
All right, well, if that
doesn't work out then...

183
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,553
I'll be here.

184
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,960
All right.

185
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,910
Yep, I'll tell her.

186
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,419
(baby crying)

187
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,577
- I'm home!

188
00:18:57,491 --> 00:18:59,158
Only 175 days to go.

189
00:19:01,925 --> 00:19:03,623
Jesus, Dad, wake up!

190
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,050
What are you doing?

191
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,410
What happened?

192
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,220
- Nothing, nothing, I just
closed my eyes for a second.

193
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,490
- No, it's not nothing, Dad.

194
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,050
Reese could have fallen on the floor

195
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,410
or gotten a hold of something or like--

196
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,780
- He can't even crawl yet, honey.

197
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,960
- Why weren't you watching him?

198
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,060
- I was right in the kitchen.

199
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,323
He didn't do it on purpose, Kim.

200
00:19:20,323 --> 00:19:21,743
- Are you okay?

201
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,340
- Hey, what time is it?

202
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,740
Is it three o'clock already?

203
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:35,250
- Eddie Drake, Patriot Exploration.

204
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,083
- Thanks for coming out.

205
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,670
- Well, this is a beautiful
property you have here.

206
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,190
I notice your land for sale sign.

207
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,433
Have you had any takers?

208
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,343
We could pay up to $1200 an acre.

209
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,970
Plus a percentage of proceeds

210
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,380
from gas production, of course.

211
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,933
Does that sound like something
you might be interested in?

212
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,197
- Here you go.

213
00:20:21,924 --> 00:20:22,757
Thank you.

214
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,460
- Hello, Ma'am.

215
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,112
Eddie Drake, Patriot Exploration.

216
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:37,850
- Not interested.

217
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,167
- I'm just lookin' for
a moment of your time

218
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:41,660
to talk about some
natural gas opportunities.

219
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,140
- Is that right?

220
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,100
Well, I'd like to talk to
you about the opportunities

221
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,520
inside the barrel of my shotgun.

222
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,890
Why don't you stay here?

223
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,510
I'll go get it.

224
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,410
- You have yourself a good day, Ma'am.

225
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,583
- Christina!

226
00:21:00,782 --> 00:21:02,763
I need you to do me a favor.

227
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,853
- [George] Hey.

228
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:16,247
- Late night? (chuckles)

229
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:17,410
(gasps)

230
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,243
Heather!

231
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:20,610
When did you get home?

232
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,876
- Last night.
- Oh.

233
00:21:23,876 --> 00:21:26,141
Well, Kathryn wanted me to invite you guys

234
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:28,040
over for dinner tonight.

235
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,974
- Oh, that sounds fun, Dad?

236
00:21:29,974 --> 00:21:31,950
- Yeah, of course.

237
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,150
Tell her we'll be there.

238
00:21:35,131 --> 00:21:36,330
- Well, you look good.

239
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,703
Very farmer chic.

240
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,813
- Thanks.

241
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,148
How long you home for?
- Just the weekend.

242
00:21:42,148 --> 00:21:43,800
- Oh, bummer.

243
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,633
- Yeah.

244
00:21:44,633 --> 00:21:46,028
- Okay, well, I'll see you in a bit.

245
00:21:46,028 --> 00:21:47,195
- 'Kay.
- Yeah.

246
00:21:57,582 --> 00:22:00,415
(baby vocalizing)

247
00:22:02,303 --> 00:22:05,220
- You working on that portfolio?

248
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,020
- Not as much as I'd like to lately.

249
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,660
- How's college goin', Heather?

250
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,593
- It's good.

251
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:14,060
- Oh, come on, tell 'em.

252
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,840
She's doin' great, she's
at the top of her class.

253
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,323
And she just made the softball team.

254
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,693
- How's things with the garage, George?

255
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,000
- Don't see much goin' on over there.

256
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,833
- Kathryn.

257
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:35,703
You want a beer?

258
00:22:35,703 --> 00:22:36,871
- Yeah, I'm due.

259
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,423
- George, I know you're in a tough spot.

260
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,530
Now that business with your
wife was surely a heart break,

261
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:54,530
but I gotta tell ya, her leaving
you and the girls the land

262
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:01,280
that is a blessing, a real opportunity.

263
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,259
- But the longer you wait,

264
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:04,129
the longer it's gonna take you

265
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:07,520
to get that earth producin' again.

266
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,210
- We've been outta the farm
business for a long time.

267
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,043
- Well, then.

268
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,820
You could lease me the land.

269
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,610
You know I'll get it back to health.

270
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,150
- How much?

271
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,200
- We'd give you a fair
price for it, George.

272
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,050
- Well, how much?

273
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,523
- 200 an acre.

274
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,890
- Let's take the baby inside.

275
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,523
- George, I know you had a visitor today.

276
00:23:41,736 --> 00:23:44,550
(baby vocalizing)

277
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,900
- Is he havin' a hard time?

278
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,383
May I?

279
00:23:49,385 --> 00:23:50,387
Oh.

280
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:53,220
(baby vocalizing)

281
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,653
See?

282
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,570
- I just hate pumping.

283
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,965
I mean, I feel like a cow or something.

284
00:24:14,965 --> 00:24:17,560
- Well, you could always give him formula.

285
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,070
- Really, it's safe for him if I switch?

286
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,163
- Absolutely.

287
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,940
If I had it to do over again,
I'd give Christina formula.

288
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,000
There's a lot of things I'd do differently

289
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,730
if I had another one.

290
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,357
Here you go. (tongue clicking)

291
00:24:31,357 --> 00:24:32,933
You know, if you ever need anything

292
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:34,533
you give me a call, all right?

293
00:24:35,426 --> 00:24:36,933
I was about your age when I had Christina

294
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,800
so I know how hard it can be.

295
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,743
- Thanks, Aubrey.

296
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,453
- So you and his daddy?

297
00:24:46,728 --> 00:24:48,563
- His dad's a teenager.

298
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,560
- You're a teenager.

299
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,560
- Well, not anymore.

300
00:24:56,484 --> 00:25:00,143
Did, um, did Christina ever meet her dad?

301
00:25:01,616 --> 00:25:02,449
- Ngh-ngh.

302
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:18,320
- I don't think you guys
are seeing the full picture.

303
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,683
Kathryn, look around you.

304
00:25:19,683 --> 00:25:22,970
You got a highway at the
back of your field now.

305
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:26,113
And where's your dairy
business, and my farm?

306
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,010
The world is leaving us behind.

307
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:34,147
- But if you make a tree
good, its fruit will be good.

308
00:25:34,147 --> 00:25:37,288
You make a tree bad, its
fruit's gonna be bad.

309
00:25:37,288 --> 00:25:39,500
- We don't need fuckin' fruit.

310
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,583
We need a miracle.

311
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,660
Yeah.

312
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,493
- George!

313
00:25:45,493 --> 00:25:48,131
- Hey, Kathryn, you make the decisions

314
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:49,563
that's best for your family.

315
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,623
I'll make the decisions
that's best for mine.

316
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,840
Not much goin' off over there.

317
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,673
Really?

318
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,363
Who does she think she is?

319
00:26:16,363 --> 00:26:17,823
- They're just concerned.

320
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,860
To be honest, so am I.

321
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,560
Why didn't you tell me the
garage was going under?

322
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,853
- What do you mean, the
garage isn't going under.

323
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:31,900
What, are you going
through all my bills now?

324
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,703
- Yeah, 'cause your lying them
on every table in the house.

325
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:39,160
Okay, this gas company.

326
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,427
What, you said it's a check
at signing for the lease

327
00:26:42,427 --> 00:26:44,000
and then it's royalties?

328
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,470
- As far as I understood.

329
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,500
- Okay, and then we see
what Kathryn can offer.

330
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,220
- Well, she can't offer shit, okay?

331
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,200
It's not exactly the
Garden of Eden over there.

332
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,121
- Okay, Dad, I know you're pissed,

333
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:56,600
but we have to consider every option.

334
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,100
- They can't help us, Heather.

335
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,437
- Okay, whatever.

336
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:05,360
We can cut costs over here,
I mean, we don't need cable.

337
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,566
- Fine.

338
00:27:06,566 --> 00:27:08,934
- And we'll turn the lights off.

339
00:27:08,934 --> 00:27:09,767
- Great.

340
00:27:09,767 --> 00:27:12,128
Let's just be Amish now.

341
00:27:12,128 --> 00:27:13,780
- I'm serious, Dad.

342
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,660
You know my school?

343
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,693
- No, no.

344
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,580
- Oh, great, welcome to
the conversation, Kim.

345
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,713
While we're here, we don't need these.

346
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,490
- What, you're not gonna
cancel my phone, are you?

347
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,820
- Jesus!

348
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,170
Kim, you know they're a
fuckin' waste of money.

349
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,206
And that's all you have to say, seriously?

350
00:27:32,206 --> 00:27:34,623
While Dad's drowning
in your medical bills?

351
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:45,787
(breathing heavily)

352
00:28:51,613 --> 00:28:53,946
(sniffling)

353
00:30:41,059 --> 00:30:43,226
(moaning)

354
00:30:53,527 --> 00:30:55,110
- Oh, don't stop!

355
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,277
(moaning)

356
00:31:01,845 --> 00:31:03,428
- [George] Oh yeah.

357
00:31:06,758 --> 00:31:09,008
(laughing)

358
00:31:12,186 --> 00:31:13,995
(laughing)

359
00:31:13,995 --> 00:31:15,245
- That was fun.

360
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,580
- Did you do some more
submissions this week?

361
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,460
- Mm-hm.

362
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,767
Some in New York.

363
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:32,017
One in Chicago.

364
00:31:33,005 --> 00:31:35,005
- Where do you wanna go?

365
00:31:37,525 --> 00:31:38,358
- MoMA.

366
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:42,166
Yancey or Guggenheim.

367
00:31:43,261 --> 00:31:44,678
- Is that Europe?

368
00:31:54,991 --> 00:31:58,658
You told me that when
Joe dies, you'd leave.

369
00:32:09,948 --> 00:32:10,781
When?

370
00:32:26,116 --> 00:32:28,783
(lips smacking)

371
00:33:12,347 --> 00:33:14,597
(grunting)

372
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,090
- Good Lord, that's a lotta food.

373
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,183
- [Vendor] Breakfast of champions.

374
00:35:36,183 --> 00:35:37,016
(laughing)

375
00:35:37,016 --> 00:35:38,230
- Thanks, man, appreciate it.

376
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,503
- [Vendor] What can I get ya?

377
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:04,823
- Christina!

378
00:37:35,218 --> 00:37:38,051
(baby vocalizing)

379
00:37:42,204 --> 00:37:43,037
- Okay.

380
00:37:46,354 --> 00:37:49,187
(baby vocalizing)

381
00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:52,922
It's okay.

382
00:37:54,761 --> 00:37:58,531
- You're gonna have to go home now, Kim.

383
00:37:58,531 --> 00:38:00,198
- Okay, I got it go.

384
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:02,448
- Okay.
- Okay.

385
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:04,960
I got you.
- Bye.

386
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,793
- Okay.

387
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:07,086
(coughing)

388
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,150
- [Heather] Still forbidden to talk to us?

389
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:58,093
- [Christina] Of course. (laughs)

390
00:41:11,012 --> 00:41:12,076
Remember when Tom and George used

391
00:41:12,076 --> 00:41:14,160
to bring us out here hunting with them?

392
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,872
(laughing)

393
00:41:15,872 --> 00:41:17,465
- (coughs) Yeah.

394
00:41:17,465 --> 00:41:19,558
You guys are gonna love this.

395
00:41:19,558 --> 00:41:21,423
- Camo'ed up head to toe.

396
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,087
And then you.

397
00:41:24,087 --> 00:41:26,198
- Would fall asleep.
- Like every single time.

398
00:41:26,198 --> 00:41:28,365
- Every single time, yeah.

399
00:41:30,202 --> 00:41:34,490
He used to get so upset when
I didn't see the turkey.

400
00:41:36,033 --> 00:41:37,819
(laughing)

401
00:41:37,819 --> 00:41:42,390
Like as if I didn't see
them every single day

402
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,723
running across the field.

403
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,430
I always loved that shirt.

404
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:51,113
It's so soft.

405
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,350
- Get your mitts off
my weed pocket, Lomack.

406
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,990
- Tom and Aubrey still come up here?

407
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,290
- No, I highly doubt that.

408
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:08,866
Ah, no, give me that.

409
00:42:08,866 --> 00:42:09,699
Give me that!

410
00:42:09,699 --> 00:42:11,949
(laughing)

411
00:42:15,076 --> 00:42:16,710
(groaning)

412
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:19,543
(camera clicking)

413
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,343
You know, I started
submitting to galleries.

414
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,630
- That's great.

415
00:42:28,517 --> 00:42:30,513
I mean, did you hear anything back or?

416
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,910
- Not yet.

417
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:34,743
- You will.

418
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,003
- How about you?

419
00:42:37,946 --> 00:42:39,620
I can't believe Kim graduated.

420
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,563
- Yeah, thank the maker.

421
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,533
- So?

422
00:42:48,982 --> 00:42:51,240
(sighing)

423
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,740
- I lost my grant and,
yeah, we could never really

424
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,463
afford college anyway so.

425
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,250
- The gas well is not?

426
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,383
- It's helping, it's just,

427
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:03,310
we were in so much debt after everything

428
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:05,553
and just kinda crossing fingers

429
00:43:05,553 --> 00:43:07,503
for that first royalty check, you know?

430
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:11,053
I'm looking into online courses.

431
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,743
But, you know, our
fuckin' internet's shit.

432
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:21,693
- You are a brilliant,
beautiful badass woman,

433
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,320
and you are gonna figure
this shit out, right?

434
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,829
- Yes.

435
00:43:26,829 --> 00:43:27,662
- Huh?

436
00:43:30,788 --> 00:43:31,621
- Yes.

437
00:43:38,693 --> 00:43:39,603
- Holy shit.

438
00:43:40,765 --> 00:43:45,765
This is good weed. (laughs)

439
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:05,242
(spitting)

440
00:45:13,485 --> 00:45:14,318
- Fishin'?

441
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,110
I bought us a couple hours.

442
00:45:23,677 --> 00:45:25,927
(coughing)

443
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,508
You know, this never woulda happened

444
00:45:45,508 --> 00:45:47,123
if Joe were still around.

445
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:49,153
- You know, Kathryn, the
Lomacks didn't really

446
00:45:49,153 --> 00:45:50,423
have a choice.

447
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,590
- There's always a choice.

448
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,500
And pretty soon, your
step-daddy's gonna have a choice.

449
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:03,500
God knows I love my son, but
when I'm gone, he's gonna sell.

450
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:09,650
Unless I leave the farm to you.

451
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:12,120
- What, no, no, Kathryn,
I didn't sign up for that.

452
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,310
- You're a farmer, Christina.

453
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:15,920
- No, I'm not and I don't wanna be.

454
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,493
- Then what do you wanna
be, a photographer?

455
00:46:21,401 --> 00:46:23,651
(coughing)

456
00:46:29,024 --> 00:46:33,810
(sighs) You know, years ago,
when Joe and I used to travel

457
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:39,663
we'd go to the bullfights, and
there's a place in the ring,

458
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:45,563
querencia, it's a place,
of sanctuary for the bull,

459
00:46:45,563 --> 00:46:50,563
where the bull feels safe
and strong and protected.

460
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:56,630
And you may think your
photographs are separate,

461
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:00,440
but there is a love of the
land that shines through.

462
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,483
This farm is your querencia.

463
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:10,213
And if you leave it,
you're gonna lose yourself.

464
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:14,600
And your pictures aren't
ever gonna be as good.

465
00:47:21,451 --> 00:47:23,160
- That's right.

466
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,783
Tell you over and over and over.

467
00:47:26,745 --> 00:47:27,828
Jesus Christ.

468
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,466
Okay, try it!

469
00:47:36,466 --> 00:47:37,299
Try it!

470
00:47:48,483 --> 00:47:50,816
(screaming)

471
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:57,556
(crying)

472
00:49:18,815 --> 00:49:21,313
- [Aubrey] I'm not sure, Tom.

473
00:49:21,313 --> 00:49:22,650
- What do you mean you're not sure?

474
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:25,468
- I mean, I'm not sure I
can work, it really hurts.

475
00:49:25,468 --> 00:49:29,420
- Aubs, come on, it's, it's not that bad.

476
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:33,060
Look, grab my hand, squeeze my hand.

477
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,250
Tighter!
(groaning)

478
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:37,300
Come on!
- I am squeezing, Tom, god!

479
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,900
- Well, maybe the bandage
needs to be tighter.

480
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,790
- My fingers are numb, just stop it.

481
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:42,623
- Hey, Mom.

482
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,060
How ya doin'?

483
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:48,620
- Oh, just trying to figure
out somethin' for tomorrow.

484
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,140
- Why don't you take the day to rest?

485
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:52,483
- Yeah, sure, take your sick leave.

486
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:57,940
Look, her hand got pinched.

487
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:59,620
Christ Almighty, it's
the end of the world?

488
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,440
- I'm sure it's gonna be fine by tomorrow.

489
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,910
- Mom, you can take a goddamn day.

490
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:05,070
- No, she can't.
- Yes, she can.

491
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,140
You slammed her hand
in the hood of a truck!

492
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,730
- [Tom] This is the worst damn timing.

493
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:11,280
- I know, I'm sorry, I'll be fine.

494
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,990
- You're sorry?

495
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:14,133
I'm going into town.

496
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:16,643
- Bright and early tomorrow!

497
00:51:12,275 --> 00:51:15,108
(baby vocalizing)

498
00:51:28,049 --> 00:51:28,882
(water splashing)

499
00:51:28,882 --> 00:51:31,132
(sneezing)

500
00:51:41,355 --> 00:51:45,355
(humming "Ring Around A Rosey")

501
00:52:25,986 --> 00:52:28,236
(retching)

502
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:51,033
- [Kathryn] Yes, I know.

503
00:52:54,663 --> 00:52:55,733
I will.

504
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:57,683
I promise.

505
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:01,143
She will.

506
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,516
She will.

507
00:53:04,516 --> 00:53:06,766
(coughing)

508
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:13,600
- Are you goin' to bed?

509
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,410
- Yeah, are you okay?

510
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:16,990
- I should get some water for this cough.

511
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:18,508
I think it's allergies.

512
00:53:18,508 --> 00:53:20,758
(coughing)

513
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,593
- Well, if it isn't the
housewife without a husband.

514
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,790
- I didn't catch that.

515
00:53:57,790 --> 00:54:00,063
- Your daddy's cash cow
starting to produce?

516
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,513
What's that?

517
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:05,400
More drinkin' money?

518
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,490
- Screw you, Kathryn.

519
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:10,607
- Heather, what are you doin'?

520
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,406
Your sister's gonna be
gone just like your Mom

521
00:54:14,406 --> 00:54:18,630
and once some moron falls
in love with George,

522
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,930
where does that leave you?

523
00:54:21,044 --> 00:54:22,524
You got so much potential--

524
00:54:22,524 --> 00:54:25,191
(loud coughing)

525
00:54:27,648 --> 00:54:29,823
You got so much potential, girl.

526
00:54:32,938 --> 00:54:36,433
I could teach you how
to manage the business.

527
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,940
You and Christina could run it together.

528
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:45,790
I've seen how you look at her.

529
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:57,663
You think about it, young lady! (coughs)

530
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,810
- We got something from Patriot.

531
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:08,386
- What is it?

532
00:55:08,386 --> 00:55:10,186
It might be our first royalty check.

533
00:55:19,088 --> 00:55:19,921
- Well?

534
00:55:23,447 --> 00:55:25,000
- That can't be right.

535
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,073
- [Heather] Let me see.

536
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:29,860
- Wait, that's it?

537
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:35,690
- Transportation fees, processing fees.

538
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:37,743
It's not right, I'll give 'em a call.

539
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:41,250
- Does that mean there's no gas?

540
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,083
- [George] I don't know.

541
00:55:42,083 --> 00:55:44,337
I don't know, she's callin'.

542
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,013
- [Heather] Hello, is this
the billing department?

543
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,990
My family just received
a check and, yeah, yes.

544
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:56,990
1-0-0-8-7-4-5-9.

545
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,480
Last name, Lomack.

546
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,396
- [Kim] I mean, there has to be a mistake.

547
00:56:00,396 --> 00:56:01,530
- [Heather] Yeah, we
were wondering if you can

548
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:02,363
explain these fees.

549
00:56:02,363 --> 00:56:04,280
- Or maybe the first
one's lower or something.

550
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,860
- [Heather] No, no, the
fees that are on the.

551
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:11,033
Yeah, yes, the ones that are
on the check we received today.

552
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:15,773
Yeah, I don't understand
what that means, can you.

553
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:18,962
No, our contract didn't
state we were paying for...

554
00:56:18,962 --> 00:56:21,879
(muffled speaking)

555
00:56:26,228 --> 00:56:28,411
Dad?

556
00:56:28,411 --> 00:56:29,373
Dad?

557
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:33,670
- What did they say?

558
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:37,113
- Well, it is stated in our contract

559
00:56:37,113 --> 00:56:42,113
that they can charge us
for transportation fees

560
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:50,320
and, um, cleaning fees,

561
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:55,034
and also marketing fees,

562
00:56:55,034 --> 00:56:56,473
which, which,

563
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,400
which is really blowing my mind.

564
00:57:01,566 --> 00:57:05,433
And then to top it all off
there's the market price

565
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:08,670
of natural gas or something.

566
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:11,220
You know how natural gas
is really cheap right now.

567
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:13,180
- So basically we're fucked.

568
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,640
- Kim.
- No, this is bullshit

569
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,593
and you know it!

570
00:57:16,453 --> 00:57:19,900
All that dirt and that noise,
and we don't get shit from it!

571
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,260
Are you serious?

572
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:22,920
- Kim!
- What?

573
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,926
- [Heather] Why don't
you let me talk to Dad?

574
00:57:24,926 --> 00:57:25,843
- Assholes!

575
00:57:30,091 --> 00:57:31,424
- [Heather] Dad.

576
00:57:35,991 --> 00:57:38,574
- This was supposed to save us.

577
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:52,716
(breathing deeply)

578
00:58:15,496 --> 00:58:18,413
(breathing deeply)

579
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,791
(whimpering)

580
00:59:22,384 --> 00:59:25,384
(breathing painfully)

581
00:59:41,086 --> 00:59:43,336
(coughing)

582
00:59:45,532 --> 00:59:48,249
- Make it stop, Joe!

583
00:59:48,249 --> 00:59:49,806
Make it stop!

584
00:59:49,806 --> 00:59:52,056
(groaning)

585
00:59:55,767 --> 00:59:58,100
(screaming)

586
01:00:48,066 --> 01:00:48,899
- Kathryn!

587
01:00:50,999 --> 01:00:51,832
Kathryn!

588
01:00:57,368 --> 01:01:00,368
(breathing heavily)

589
01:01:47,584 --> 01:01:50,417
(baby vocalizing)

590
01:01:56,831 --> 01:01:58,011
- Hey.

591
01:01:58,011 --> 01:01:59,344
Hey, Reesey, hi.

592
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:04,347
Oh, come here, come here, hi.

593
01:02:06,992 --> 01:02:08,075
Good morning.

594
01:02:11,032 --> 01:02:13,282
(coughing)

595
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:28,853
- Kathryn?

596
01:02:34,449 --> 01:02:36,699
(coughing)

597
01:02:41,946 --> 01:02:43,033
Jesus, Mom.

598
01:02:44,476 --> 01:02:45,753
Oh my god, you should go to the doctor.

599
01:02:45,753 --> 01:02:49,323
- It's gonna be fine, just. (coughs)

600
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:12,623
- [Heather] I got it!

601
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:17,063
Hello?

602
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:18,853
What's wrong?

603
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:25,600
I'll come right after dinner then.

604
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,273
Christina needs me!

605
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:29,713
Kathryn's missing.

606
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:57,263
- [Tom] Mom?

607
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:06,807
- It's just a sheet.

608
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:26,520
- Please, for Mama, please.

609
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,990
Please.

610
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:29,348
A little bit, little bit?

611
01:04:29,348 --> 01:04:30,181
Oh.

612
01:04:33,506 --> 01:04:36,423
Come on, please, just a little bit.

613
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:41,034
Come on.

614
01:04:41,034 --> 01:04:42,072
No.

615
01:04:42,072 --> 01:04:43,905
It's really good, see?

616
01:04:48,921 --> 01:04:49,754
Oh my.

617
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,780

618
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:36,346
- [Christina] Kathryn?

619
01:05:41,353 --> 01:05:42,186
- Oh, hey.

620
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:50,638
What's goin' on?

621
01:05:50,638 --> 01:05:51,721
Are you okay?

622
01:05:56,535 --> 01:05:58,094
Okay.

623
01:05:58,094 --> 01:05:59,427
Okay, come here.

Hey.

628

Come on, come on, come on.

Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

(groaning)

637
01:08:13,223 --> 01:08:15,056

638
01:08:25,357 --> 01:08:28,107
(women grunting)

639
01:08:42,157 --> 01:08:42,990
Let go!

Mama?

655
01:12:38,701 --> 01:12:39,534

Tom, back away now!

No!

667
01:13:27,029 --> 01:13:27,862
Daddy!

Okay, hey.

676
01:14:03,037 --> 01:14:04,537

677
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:07,374
- Ring around the rosey.

678
01:14:08,753 --> 01:14:10,843

686
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:39,394
Reesey?

Is that you?

688

huddled altogether.

690
01:14:55,881 --> 01:15:00,130
Ashes, they all.

691
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:02,563
Where are you, you little bastard?

692
01:15:04,335 --> 01:15:06,302

We gotta go.

702
01:15:41,125 --> 01:15:42,708
- [Christina] Help!

703
01:15:43,546 --> 01:15:44,379
No, no!

704
01:15:45,794 --> 01:15:46,711
Wait, stop!

705
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:49,640
- [George] Kim.

706
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:50,793
- Dad, I'm staying.

707
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:55,160
When you're safe, call me
at the Dolan's. - I love you.

708
01:16:10,801 --> 01:16:13,218

(man choking)
(man grunting)

713
01:17:02,174 --> 01:17:03,007

715
01:17:12,918 --> 01:17:15,918
(breathing heavily)

716
01:17:47,968 --> 01:17:49,801
- Whose blood is that?

717
01:17:52,330 --> 01:17:53,413
- Kim's hurt.

718
01:17:56,544 --> 01:17:57,461
Reese is...

719
01:18:01,972 --> 01:18:02,805
- Kathryn.

720
01:18:04,062 --> 01:18:04,895
Tom, too.

721
01:18:13,073 --> 01:18:14,823
Have you seen my mom?

722
01:18:31,537 --> 01:18:32,370
Listen.

723
01:18:41,743 --> 01:18:43,160
Do you hear that?

724
01:18:46,626 --> 01:18:47,555
There's nothing.

725
01:18:47,555 --> 01:18:50,388
There's no birds, there's no bugs.

726
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:56,215
(shouting)

727
01:19:56,215 --> 01:19:59,632
