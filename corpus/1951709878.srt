22
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,900

00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:22,300
I just was remember a rhyme...

35
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,300
There was a very pregnant woman...

36
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,100
she had three kind, named:
Nat, Pat and Tat...

37
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,800
she said that it was amusing
to make them...

38
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,800
But it was a hell to breastfeed them...

39
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Because she didnt have any teat for Tat...

40
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,400

00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,300

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,700

After the woman escape,
we trup her here...

65
00:08:56,935 --> 00:08:59,100
The guy was siting on a
bus stop in the dark...

66
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,000
Then he jumped toward to
us and he helped the woman

67
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,200
He took a gun, He start
shooting us and then you came...

He saw me a couple of times
when I offered normal sex

136
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,200

137
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,100
I don't believe you

138
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,800

00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,400
Did you see that?
I hate that...

183
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,727
what? This car is changing lines
without the warning signal

184
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,100
So difficult it is, to use the blink?

185
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,800
Did you start shooting them?

186
00:25:00,835 --> 00:25:02,700
No, I don't carry gun

187
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,165
I was with the woman.
She had a gun

188
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,400
They began to shoot me,
and I shoot them back!

189
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,700
I move my fingers 2
cm to use the blink

190
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,400
Why is so hard for him to do the same...

191
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,500
That they cannot move the finger
some cm to drive safe?

192
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,000
Do you want to know why?
Not especially

193
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,444
Because These rich bastards

194
00:25:23,445 --> 00:25:25,898
they can kill even their own mother
in order to make more money...

195
00:25:25,933 --> 00:25:26,965
So when they are driving,
they cannot help them selves..

196
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,200
they have the same attituded,
are incosiderable drivers too..

197
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,200
Why you didnt takes the baby to the police?

198
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,600
No, I cant go to them

199
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,800
Why not?

200
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,300
I Am "Unabomber"

201
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,100
They already caught "Unabomber"...

202
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,800

203
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,100

230
00:27:52,035 --> 00:27:53,400
Making money?

231
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,500
To buy something for the baby...

232
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,000
To buy something to the baby?

233
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,400
A bullet proof jacket is the beter
investment for this baby...

234
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,000
That make me think, what you are thinking
to put on him when he will go to school?

235
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,100
So, this is it...

236
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,600

Say hallo to Mickey

240
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,100
Maybe, I should take the baby
to the police

241
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,900
No, you will never make it...

242
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,856
They might have a Van to be watching over there and
they should have a policemen in their pocket...

243
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,800
already joined 50 men...

244
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,900

WEAPONS

246
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,100
Stop the car.
It was here...

247
00:29:19,135 --> 00:29:21,065
What makes you think he was here?

248
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:25,100
Trust me, I know what people think,
I always do..

249
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,400
Even When I was a kind i had this gift...

250
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,600
You had to see me playing arround the
"Paper, Stone and Scissors"...

251
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,400
Stop the car!

252
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Do you think who wants this baby dead?

253
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,200
I have no idea who wants to kill it

254
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,500
Don't call it "that"...

255
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,600
For me it is an object

256
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,100
Tell me, Smith,
Is there something that you like?

257
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,300
Yes, my privacy

258
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,800
Tell me something that I dont know for once,
You son of bitch, bastard

259
00:30:01,835 --> 00:30:03,900
I love you to speak this way to me...

260
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,600
Can I offer you something?

261
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,500
A carrot?

262
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,100
They are good for your eyes

263
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,200
From all of the places in the city,
He knows that Smith is here..

264
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,100
Did have a lucky guess?

265
00:30:23,135 --> 00:30:24,600
No, He doesnt guess...

266
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,500
Thinks, things that we don't,
he was an investigator of the FBI

267
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
"Forensic behavior adviser"

268
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,700
How many times I have to say?

269
00:30:35,735 --> 00:30:37,900
The details...

270
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,500
They are to important
in this business.

271
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,700
Hear, but...

272
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,800
Dont you think that he should ne bag soon?

273
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,900
the leader that stays
behind, He take it from the behind.

274
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,000
Also...

275
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,600
...it is very amusing to see violence.

276
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,165
No, baby, no...

277
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,665
We can call it Oliver.

278
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,400
Oliver?
yea, as Oliver Twist

279
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,965
For that is orphan?

280
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,165
For that I like the book.

281
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,800
Do you like it?
I Dint hate it.

282
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,100
That is a miracle

283
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,700
That birthday card,
you think that you can go with it?

284
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,400
Pretty and adorable...

285
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,900
Or... you are already a man

286
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,500
Sr. Hertz, how old is your son?

287
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,700
8 years...

288
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,300
Can you believe it? Not there is anything
in the TV about this

289
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,900
A bomb hurt...

290
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,900
Did you notice that?

291
00:31:58,935 --> 00:32:00,100
That yea I noticed that?

292
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
look.

293
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,100
The politicians speak for gun control

294
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,200
...and it cries

295
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,200
We can change it to this hard Rock music...

296
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,500
...and he is quiet

297
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,900
That is strange

298
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,000
It should comfort him

299
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,400
Mr.?

300
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,000
The men are in the roof

301
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,400
That well

302
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,500
Anybody knows what
James cagney love scene, is?

303
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,800
It is when Cagney leaves
the good guy to live.

304
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,300
And when that happends in the show...

305
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,700
...I want alot more, in order not
to aks my money back

306
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:49,500
Let's kill this mother. Go!

307
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I am not surprised that He likes Rock

308
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,000
You look like a substitute parents

309
00:32:58,035 --> 00:33:00,800
No, I tell you, this means...

310
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,600
Go back!

311
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,300
My God, they are so bad
or this guy is very good?

312
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,200
Let us go boys!
They Still not safe

313
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,500
Kill the dog!
No.

314
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,900
why not?
I like dogs.

315
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,700
Give me a minute

316
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,200
That unfortunate rat

317
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,500
What it is?

318
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,600
the babies diaper

319
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,500
It is a terrible idea, Smith

320
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,265
It is the only one that we have

321
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:06,700
Your you believe that Oliver's mama
she lived near to a club..

322
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,365
...and that the baby could hear the
music from the club?

323
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,700
yea, for that reason he doesn't cry when
he listens rock music..

324
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,300
This is a ridiculous idea

325
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,500
He is not crying now

326
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,100
This is the only club
near where I saw his mom.

327
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,600
It is a very crazy hunch

328
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,100
yea, Can you explain all those
boxes of diapers?

329
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,000
Somebody needed those supplies

330
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,000
Lets find, who

331
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,800
Are you the owner?

332
00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:53,100
Who asks?

333
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,400
I ask

334
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,100
Can I invite you for a drink?

335
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,800
No, I already imagined it...

336
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,800
This covered with hoops

337
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,500
Who occupies the room up stares?

338
00:38:11,535 --> 00:38:12,500
go to hell!

339
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,765
Don't mess with me

340
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,800
You dont have the balls.

341
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,000
My God!

342
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,000
Who are those guys?

343
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,800
I Rent the room to a
businessman, 11 months ago

344
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,300
they pay for an entire year, cash

345
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,700
I never saw them again.
I believe that they entered from behind.

346
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Open up.

347
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,300
This is very strange.

348
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,400
Sir.,There is nowhere to go this guy.

349
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,900
All the mothers have been killed.

350
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,800
Only one have escaped, temporarily.

351
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,800
We find the body, and
we confirm that she gave a birth

352
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,965
The child births suposed it was secret,

353
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,800
They start an manufacture
maternity, above a club...

354
00:39:50,835 --> 00:39:52,400
...and it wasnt remain secret

355
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,200
We killed all the baby siters we find here.

356
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,465
When it happens, go to the left.

357
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,600
I Already made the call, they
must coming in any minute.

358
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,800
We will clean everything and we will try
to discover what happen

359
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,600
Thank you Mister,
I appreciate your trust.

360
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,800
Gentlemen, let find some answers.

361
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,500
Mind where you step.

362
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
The ice cream is melting.

363
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,565
What?

364
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,800
Your specialty is not
the donated sperm.

365
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,200
This this full with samples

366
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,900
That strange.

367
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,400
Seems to be only one donor

368
00:40:33,435 --> 00:40:34,400
One donor?

369
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,400
yea, and is a very generous.

370
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,700
It is bone marrow blood, it should
to be for some cure.

371
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,300
How do you know that, Smith?

372
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,800
Youd didnt hear about my Nobel prize?

373
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,300
It is difficult to find compatible marrow
with that of the receiver

374
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,500
The possibilites improved if the
donors one has the same DNA with the receivers.

375
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,650
They were taking babys organs for
some guys transplante?

376
00:41:17,685 --> 00:41:21,800
Exactly. And somebody didnt want
to avoid the transplante.

377
00:41:21,835 --> 00:41:24,200
For that reason they want to kill Oliver.

378
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,000
No, baby, no.

379
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,200
So, I Called a guy that
I knew in NBC.

380
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,600
And I started to think,
Do you know what I hate?

381
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,300
Oh... there we go again

382
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:07,200
The movies that the good guy become 
to betrayed by some one that he trust.

383
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,100
yea, it is as serious as
to kill baby seals

384
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,100
Call to ABC, CBS...

385
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:17,200
The Post, the Times, the local
news chanel and the FBI.

386
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,100
And what you ll do next?

387
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:25,700
I ll wait to see the news, and if the story
goes in publin, maybe we will be safe.

388
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,000
look. He finally get to sleep.

389
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,800
You just wait. As soon are closings
their eyes so soon they began to scream.

390
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,100
Your you are not able to pleasure
anything, realy?

391
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,000
You hate everything.

392
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,400
I don't hate you.

393
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,450
For that reason you bring it to me?

394
00:42:45,485 --> 00:42:47,000
you know that I didnt picked you.

395
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,700
you dont have any idea
what you have done to me.

396
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:51,300
We can get out of this.

397
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,300
It is that you don't understand.

398
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,600
what?

399
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:01,700
You bring me this boy so I can feed him
and take care of him.

400
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,700
And the baby could be die
in any moment.

401
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:10,500
And you are not even asked me what
happed to my own son.

402
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,400
You are right.

403
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,500
It is unforgivable.

404
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,900
I have the blame.

405
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,500
He didnt even called me mama...

406
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,700
If I ll ask you for forgiveness,
will you translate that to me?

407
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
The eggs must not
dance with the stones.

408
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,000
You Know, Smith...

409
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:11,014
I think I know what you hate most...

410
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:13,579
yourself.

411
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,036
What killed your baby?

412
00:44:18,311 --> 00:44:19,726
Forget it

413
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:21,328
Tell me...

414
00:44:23,049 --> 00:44:25,772
My "Pimp" stick me in the stomach...

415
00:44:26,266 --> 00:44:27,901
My baby...

416
00:44:28,746 --> 00:44:31,450
He was borned dead.

417
00:44:35,229 --> 00:44:36,728
Get off of me...

418
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:55,610
You like this, hey...

419
00:44:59,877 --> 00:45:01,573
It is a gun...

420
00:45:02,528 --> 00:45:08,474
Fist, sliding bar,
it embroidered, canyon, trigger.

421
00:45:08,713 --> 00:45:11,141
This is the side that
it make it work.

422
00:45:11,176 --> 00:45:15,783
You should never point this in
anything that you don't want to kill.

423
00:45:16,431 --> 00:45:19,772
This is important.
This is the insurance.

424
00:45:20,616 --> 00:45:24,484
You have to have in safety mode
in order not to shot alone.

425
00:45:24,674 --> 00:45:25,859
But in fact...

426
00:45:26,714 --> 00:45:29,393
...this it is your best insurance.

427
00:45:34,462 --> 00:45:36,598
Are you hungry?

428
00:47:37,216 --> 00:47:39,483
Speaking of a complete discharge.

429
00:47:46,174 --> 00:47:47,516
looks at this.

430
00:47:48,005 --> 00:47:50,088
This is a Hammerson Nite Tac.

431
00:47:50,374 --> 00:47:52,687
They will leave it for sale in 6 months.

432
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,305
That strange.

433
00:47:57,049 --> 00:47:58,780
All have one of these.

434
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,900
Dont even tell me

435
00:48:05,516 --> 00:48:08,131
Do you know how many
men of ours had liquidated?

436
00:48:08,229 --> 00:48:11,556
Why to weast my beautiful mind
for things like that?

437
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,997
Doesnt make you a little angry?

438
00:48:14,117 --> 00:48:17,512
When getting angry you loose one
enzyme, triptofan hidroxilasa...

439
00:48:17,633 --> 00:48:20,356
...that they can reduce
temporarily the intelligence

440
00:48:20,458 --> 00:48:22,564
Not I can give myself the luxury
of making that.

441
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,073
How do you know of that?

442
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:26,752
My boy is trapped with
the Discovery channel.

443
00:48:27,168 --> 00:48:28,126
Take me to the West side.

444
00:48:28,161 --> 00:48:32,615
I need to report him in,
I think I PE-d on who our Mr. Hero is.

445
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,336
We will no longer discuss.

446
00:48:37,532 --> 00:48:41,145
I need to do this alone. And
to know that you are safe.

447
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:45,870
This is the only place
that you will be safe.

448
00:48:46,278 --> 00:48:47,506
In a tank?

449
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:51,905
A tank M24. They are safe
from bullets and other explosive.

450
00:48:52,122 --> 00:48:53,230
You are crazy

451
00:48:53,265 --> 00:48:53,846
I am

452
00:48:54,347 --> 00:48:56,121
I also speak seriously.

453
00:48:56,403 --> 00:48:58,059
Is forbidden to get in.

454
00:48:58,132 --> 00:49:01,992
Don't worry... I will create
a diversion and you'll climbe inside.

455
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:05,544
There is enough food
for the baby for two days.

456
00:49:05,773 --> 00:49:08,907
The puree of carrots
it is the best.

457
00:49:09,536 --> 00:49:11,726
Do you know how to use this... really?

458
00:49:12,736 --> 00:49:16,104
yea, but what if you dont come back?

459
00:49:16,139 --> 00:49:17,587
That won't happen

460
00:49:17,736 --> 00:49:19,807
we can be sure.

461
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:22,784
Yes there is.

462
00:49:42,681 --> 00:49:44,768
But mama I want to go home!

463
00:49:44,803 --> 00:49:45,900
Stop to complain!

464
00:49:45,935 --> 00:49:48,374
Behave well or I give you a spanking!

465
00:49:48,409 --> 00:49:50,813
I want to leave!
Stop to complain!

466
00:49:52,507 --> 00:49:54,711
I hate that hit a boy.

467
00:49:54,746 --> 00:49:57,140
Leave alone!
No if you dont stop hit the boy.

468
00:49:57,175 --> 00:50:01,753
I can disiplina my kind like want.
Do you like to spanking to you?

469
00:50:03,816 --> 00:50:06,910
Do you go?, it doesn't feel very well, does it.

470
00:50:16,206 --> 00:50:16,223
Its not funny!

471
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:16,258
Not it is funny!

472
00:50:33,761 --> 00:50:37,488
What you know about this
so spectacular soldier?

473
00:50:37,523 --> 00:50:40,441
Anybody so good
he had to start very young.

474
00:50:40,476 --> 00:50:43,360
And usually their papa
it was also good.

475
00:50:43,395 --> 00:50:45,587
The papa of MacArthur was general

476
00:50:45,622 --> 00:50:48,031
And Mickey's dad Mantle
juice baseball.

477
00:50:48,066 --> 00:50:51,568
My son dominates the games of
videos, and I was good for Pong.

478
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:55,570
Please follow me, Sr. Hammerson.

479
00:50:55,605 --> 00:50:59,646
In 1967 the Englishmen put on
hard the control of weapons.

480
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:02,936
Many makers of
you arm they moved in U.S.

481
00:51:02,971 --> 00:51:05,718
I have a man in immigration.

482
00:51:05,753 --> 00:51:07,789
...seeing how many of them had sons...

483
00:51:07,824 --> 00:51:10,614
...and yea some of those boy was a great hardshoot...

484
00:51:10,649 --> 00:51:15,585
I believe that have been affecting from the "factor men".
You dont have anything for this man!

485
00:51:17,003 --> 00:51:19,635
yea, Duchess was a good girl.

486
00:51:19,637 --> 00:51:20,613
Sit!

487
00:51:21,193 --> 00:51:23,525
yea. Now you ll play for your cookie.

488
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,823
My man that his been looking for him...

489
00:51:25,858 --> 00:51:29,502
...he remembered the son
of one guns maker...

490
00:51:30,705 --> 00:51:33,673
that was a National Champion of guns
in age of 10..

491
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:36,041
Candidate for the Olympiads,
and He recruit it by the army

492
00:51:38,105 --> 00:51:41,893
But after that the kind never come back again.
Kisses...

493
00:51:41,928 --> 00:51:44,203
It seems that operations
quarter trained him.

494
00:51:44,238 --> 00:51:47,085
That which takes me to a theory...

495
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,897
Theory?
That sounds as a gossip!

496
00:51:49,932 --> 00:51:53,121
The only thing that you know about him,
its.. is a man without a name.

497
00:51:53,156 --> 00:51:59,446
...who arrived to town on a
white horse to give justice.

498
00:52:18,454 --> 00:52:20,258
I LOVE THE CATS

499
00:52:30,663 --> 00:52:34,114
Do You know for the people
of this country, why they love the guns?

500
00:52:34,149 --> 00:52:39,430
Not because they like the word "discharge"

501
00:52:39,892 --> 00:52:42,410
No, people love the guns...

502
00:52:42,445 --> 00:52:45,501
For that USA is the land
of the opportunities

503
00:52:45,536 --> 00:52:48,558
...where a poor person he can become rich...

504
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:53,576
...and a pussy can
be a hard type...

505
00:52:53,611 --> 00:52:56,443
...if he's got a gun in his hand.

506
00:52:58,814 --> 00:53:02,582
I Hope you are not just a pusy
with a gun in your hand.

507
00:53:02,617 --> 00:53:05,210
No, Mister,
I am not

508
00:53:05,245 --> 00:53:09,323
I am a tough guy, with
that pussy in my hand.

509
00:53:13,721 --> 00:53:19,528
I want you to put this guy
and the kind to a deardbag.

510
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:21,161
yea Mister...

511
00:53:23,927 --> 00:53:26,716
Right away, Sir...

512
00:53:29,747 --> 00:53:34,162
Don't worry,
dad will return soon.

513
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,978
Hold it! Hold it!

514
00:53:57,921 --> 00:54:02,344
Well-well-well, Mr. Bunny, you just
keep going-going-going, dontcha.

515
00:54:02,379 --> 00:54:04,017
You also

516
00:54:04,052 --> 00:54:08,515
I promise you not to kill you, if you say to me
where this girl and the baby are.

517
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:09,654
Forget it!

518
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,100
Oh

519
00:54:23,877 --> 00:54:25,357
Who trained you?

520
00:54:26,315 --> 00:54:29,995
NSA, Black-ops, CIA, the Army?

521
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:33,789
What who ever is the sme. It seems that
you lost your aim, champion.

522
00:54:33,824 --> 00:54:36,937
You should see me write
my name in the snow.

523
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:44,667
Hey ya know my boss here thinks such
you're the lone rangers or sumtin...

524
00:54:44,668 --> 00:54:49,445
But I believe I've a better
idea bout who you are.

525
00:54:50,327 --> 00:54:53,563
I found out how your
wife and son were killed.

526
00:54:53,598 --> 00:54:55,882
My God, what a tragedy!

527
00:54:55,883 --> 00:55:00,574
Some guy walks into the BurgerJoy,
he starts shooting up the police...

528
00:55:00,575 --> 00:55:04,842
Oh my God, what a shame,
that your wife and son were there...

529
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:10,507
...having chicken nuggets...

530
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:16,634
What's the matter,
you dont like that story?

531
00:55:19,756 --> 00:55:23,430
I want you to tell me one.
Children story, please...

532
00:55:24,355 --> 00:55:29,456

533
00:55:30,167 --> 00:55:32,125
Maybe later.

534
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:34,955
When I will put you to sleep.

535
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:38,236
Go go go!

536
00:56:49,545 --> 00:56:52,258
So What you are you thinking
about the right to carry weapons, now?

537
00:56:52,293 --> 00:56:53,519
Fuck you!

538
00:56:54,645 --> 00:56:57,705
Ok buddy, drop your weapon.

539
00:57:07,497 --> 00:57:09,425
You think we kill him?

540
00:57:33,035 --> 00:57:36,881
God Dammit, Smith!

541
00:57:37,216 --> 00:57:40,103
So I found out who tried to kill the baby.
Who?

542
00:57:40,244 --> 00:57:44,583
A certain Hammerso, was born with one
tablespoon of the silver in the bottom.

543
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,748
It inherited a corporation
of firearms

544
00:57:47,317 --> 00:57:49,454
It wins millions manufacturing weapons

545
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:54,341
Do You have any idea of who
needs Oliver's "death"?

546
00:57:54,376 --> 00:57:57,517
Its ok, Oliver.

547
00:57:58,187 --> 00:58:02,959
Rutledge wins in New Hampshire
Shit!

548
00:58:03,612 --> 00:58:05,632
It Is the Senator Rutledge.

549
00:58:05,667 --> 00:58:07,618
THE CONTROL OF WEAPONS KEY

550
00:58:07,653 --> 00:58:10,455
If he select the presided he will
make that Hammerson business

551
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,088
Ok, but how are you sure?

552
00:58:13,158 --> 00:58:15,862
The Mr. right "Arm"
I call to their men nannies.

553
00:58:15,897 --> 00:58:18,849
The Secret Service calls to those
protective of VIP, nannies

554
00:58:20,213 --> 00:58:23,078
The Senator Rutledge is
the one that needs the baby

555
00:58:23,463 --> 00:58:27,337
We will contact this man and there will
be no danger anymore. And its over

556
00:58:27,372 --> 00:58:28,076
You are crazy?

557
00:58:28,111 --> 00:58:31,404
Hammerson and the whole government
of the USA are after us

558
00:58:31,627 --> 00:58:33,710
We have to leave the city

559
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:36,157
Until I have the answers you are not safe.

560
00:58:36,277 --> 00:58:39,459
They watch over all the buss stations,
trains and airports

561
00:58:39,494 --> 00:58:41,290
TRAVEL IN THE GREEN BUS
This is safe

562
00:58:43,221 --> 00:58:44,775
I will investigate well.

563
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:47,328
I will reach you before
get on the bus

564
00:58:47,363 --> 00:58:52,296
And if you don't arrive before we leave?
Where should I get off?

565
00:58:53,256 --> 00:58:55,042
Honey, It's better
if I don't know.

566
00:58:55,077 --> 00:58:56,700
What?
trust me

567
00:58:57,686 --> 00:58:59,667
I cannot know it

568
00:59:06,121 --> 00:59:08,857
Smith, you Believe that this
will work?

569
00:59:08,892 --> 00:59:11,438
Attempt to the plan,
and everything will be alright.

570
00:59:13,486 --> 00:59:14,619
Run!

571
01:01:40,624 --> 01:01:43,142
You can forget the belt
of security

572
01:02:09,372 --> 01:02:11,684
What in hell is that?

573
01:02:12,925 --> 01:02:15,570
My God they twisted.

574
01:02:15,826 --> 01:02:18,097
That sick sunova'bitch.

575
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,699
Oh that sick son of a bitch
stuck at us again!

576
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:29,768
It is time to go boy.

577
01:02:33,186 --> 01:02:35,827
I call for the guy that he
protects the Senator Rutledge

578
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:41,194
Just Tell him, that the man with baby calling

579
01:02:43,238 --> 01:02:45,423
Hello, Does Smith Speak?

580
01:02:45,497 --> 01:02:48,158
Your man they try to clean the place of your
hide hatchery with babies in down town

581
01:02:48,243 --> 01:02:50,198
But nothing will you succeed if I wont give the baby

582
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:53,322
Only in Washinton they have
so much influence

583
01:02:53,824 --> 01:02:55,798
We are in the same side.

584
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:58,750
We can make it with the easy way
or with the hard way.

585
01:02:59,636 --> 01:03:01,638
I want to see the Senator

586
01:03:02,268 --> 01:03:05,816
Good. he also wants to see you too

587
01:03:06,198 --> 01:03:08,810
I will go to North Carolina.
There are elections in three days

588
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:12,909
You can go in the airplane with him.
Track 7 in two hours

589
01:03:12,944 --> 01:03:18,078
If I see something that I don't like
everybody will know about it

590
01:03:30,291 --> 01:03:32,950
what you were doing here inside?

591
01:03:34,239 --> 01:03:35,618
I was cleaning my gun.

592
01:03:36,231 --> 01:03:37,732
Seriously?

593
01:03:38,814 --> 01:03:41,207
We never realy trying to kill you.

594
01:03:41,242 --> 01:03:43,142
We only wanted to make
you surrendered.

595
01:03:43,434 --> 01:03:46,362
That explains the bad aim.

596
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:49,741
The Senator Rutledge, continues
to the head of the Democrats...

597
01:03:49,776 --> 01:03:52,356
...before the elections
primary of Tuesday.

598
01:03:57,582 --> 01:03:59,127
I owe you my life.

599
01:03:59,162 --> 01:04:01,789
Here is the place that you were gave
all those orders...

600
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:05,156
I heard about you

601
01:04:05,191 --> 01:04:06,951
It is worse than in television

602
01:04:07,917 --> 01:04:10,607
It is incredible what
a little make-up can do

603
01:04:10,642 --> 01:04:12,452
And a lot of morphine

604
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:16,601
So...

605
01:04:17,465 --> 01:04:19,344
...You realy discovered us.

606
01:04:20,461 --> 01:04:23,544
You are very clever Mr. Smith.
Very clever.

607
01:04:24,265 --> 01:04:27,784
It was easy. You are a candidate
important for the Presidency

608
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:32,777
With Your proposal of weapons control,
you made mad the wrong people

609
01:04:32,818 --> 01:04:36,590
yea they are angry now,But wait
I until be the president

610
01:04:36,775 --> 01:04:39,539
There are so many lobbyists of weapons...

611
01:04:39,574 --> 01:04:41,920
...that we will have
to establish many commissions

612
01:04:42,002 --> 01:04:44,635
And maybe we do this way
our first law of the year

613
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:47,233
Those of the weapons
they informed about your illness.

614
01:04:47,268 --> 01:04:50,871
They discovered the incubator
of your babies and they resolved the problem

615
01:04:50,897 --> 01:04:52,826
They killing you by killing the babies

616
01:04:52,858 --> 01:04:54,023
Correct

617
01:04:54,993 --> 01:04:56,622
Where this my savior?

618
01:04:57,567 --> 01:04:59,250
My God a he/she arms!

619
01:05:02,247 --> 01:05:05,259
Do you know that the most I hate are the lies..
What In Hell are you doing?

620
01:05:05,294 --> 01:05:07,811
You made a deal with Hammerson.
You are crazy!

621
01:05:07,846 --> 01:05:11,307
When you went to bed, you filed with
their dogs hairs

622
01:05:11,342 --> 01:05:14,793
And judging by the hair in your
pants, Duchess likes you alot

623
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:16,630
I dont know what are you talking about

624
01:05:16,665 --> 01:05:18,433
I would say that he
wont be a president

625
01:05:18,468 --> 01:05:20,177
If he ends up here...

626
01:05:20,212 --> 01:05:22,782
Do you know what I hate most?
the hypocrites

627
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:24,726
And you are bigest of them all

628
01:05:24,761 --> 01:05:26,683
That accusation doesnt have been sold?

629
01:05:26,847 --> 01:05:30,742
Our operation is to find the baby

630
01:05:31,206 --> 01:05:34,578
You see, Rutledge calls us
and offered us a proposetion...

631
01:05:35,037 --> 01:05:37,466
...with the something that we had never dreamt

632
01:05:38,057 --> 01:05:41,206
In exchange of his life, he promised us
to protect our rights

633
01:05:41,241 --> 01:05:43,067
To go hunting deers with an "Uzi"

634
01:05:43,245 --> 01:05:47,086
Please, Smith. The guns
they don't kill people.

635
01:05:47,121 --> 01:05:48,938
But yea they help

636
01:05:49,997 --> 01:05:51,650
Back off, back off.

637
01:05:52,042 --> 01:05:54,195
Back of or I will kill him
Please!

638
01:05:54,722 --> 01:05:58,344
I have to do it!
I must be a president

639
01:05:58,379 --> 01:06:01,160
To put your self
before the people

640
01:06:01,195 --> 01:06:03,450
I can still do good, in other areas.

641
01:06:03,485 --> 01:06:05,706
Are you gonna squeal
with the public?

642
01:06:05,789 --> 01:06:08,523
It is a Constitutional right

643
01:06:08,558 --> 01:06:09,796
Back off! Get back!

644
01:06:09,831 --> 01:06:11,672
Finally they convinced me

645
01:06:11,707 --> 01:06:14,003
They convinced you just saying "Hello"

646
01:06:14,745 --> 01:06:16,454
Allow me to give you an advice

647
01:06:16,663 --> 01:06:20,787
Never trust people that try to benefit
against the peoples life, they are bad

648
01:06:20,822 --> 01:06:24,771
Dont be silly. The game is over,
you throw the dice and you lost.

649
01:06:54,065 --> 01:06:56,133
Let him go, Smith!
There is no escape.

650
01:06:56,223 --> 01:06:58,466
Maybe for me not, but
for the woman and the baby, yes

651
01:06:58,501 --> 01:07:00,174
For your assasination, Rutledge...

652
01:07:00,209 --> 01:07:02,544
...will be a lot of anger and
the will support your proposal.

653
01:07:02,681 --> 01:07:04,156
They will vote in the Congress...

654
01:07:04,191 --> 01:07:08,762
...for law antiarms,
go by an overwhelming majority.

655
01:07:09,242 --> 01:07:12,291
Their legacy... will live on.

656
01:07:12,406 --> 01:07:13,901
Don't do it!

657
01:07:14,809 --> 01:07:19,198
Don't do it. Allow to recover
some my honor with my...

658
01:07:25,343 --> 01:07:26,867
son of bitch...

659
01:07:27,776 --> 01:07:29,344
You son of bitch!

660
01:07:33,463 --> 01:07:35,212
God Dammit!

661
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:45,400
Don't move Mr. hero...

662
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:51,000
Not I can speak sweethaerd now...
I am halfway something

663
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:52,800
Good-bye.

664
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,200
Don't worry, Duchess...

665
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:23,700
It won't gona happendto you.
At least for some years

666
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,136
Well well well well well.

667
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:32,926
Somebody gets to be smart
and somebody gets to be dumb.

668
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:37,172
Looks like you and I are finally
changing places, boy?

669
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,000
Yes, indeed.

670
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,300
The circle of life

671
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:46,200
the cirle a jerk of life

672
01:10:47,067 --> 01:10:49,723
You are very good with the words

673
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,600
Now

674
01:10:55,621 --> 01:11:01,535
I want you to tell me where
the woman and the boy are

675
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:06,169
Tell me, or I will be forced to
cause you considerable agony.

676
01:11:06,204 --> 01:11:07,337
Believe me..

677
01:11:07,372 --> 01:11:12,117
...nothing can be more
painful than hear you jerk talking.

678
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:21,719
I ll ask you... Again.
Where the woman and the boy are?

679
01:11:23,782 --> 01:11:26,421
Thats is the last time that
you be doing that

680
01:11:29,044 --> 01:11:33,018
Tell me what I want to hear. You decide when
pain will stop.

681
01:11:33,053 --> 01:11:36,427
Why you doing this?
Its over

682
01:11:36,462 --> 01:11:39,071
Sortly we will be finished for sure...

683
01:11:40,371 --> 01:11:42,246
No, I should thank you...

684
01:11:42,911 --> 01:11:46,210
They gave me a biger contract
because of you

685
01:11:46,875 --> 01:11:50,576
I wasnt just Hammerson hominate

686
01:11:50,611 --> 01:11:52,875
what are you babbling now?

687
01:11:53,066 --> 01:11:55,732
You realy believe that
people that hires me...

688
01:11:55,767 --> 01:12:00,013
...they will accept not to
kill the sun of Senator

689
01:12:00,048 --> 01:12:01,960
you can hide all this...

690
01:12:03,369 --> 01:12:05,391
you didnt have heard the news?

691
01:12:05,542 --> 01:12:08,267
The senator's airplane
crash at the river

692
01:12:08,302 --> 01:12:10,031
And they havent been able to find
the body of Senator

693
01:12:10,566 --> 01:12:14,812
Since I will silent you and
the woman, nobody will know anything

694
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:18,901
Again I ask you,
Where the woman and the boy are?

695
01:12:18,936 --> 01:12:22,058
You know what will happend if you break me
another one of my fingers?

696
01:12:22,093 --> 01:12:24,879
My son told me.
That You ll hit me in the nose

697
01:12:24,914 --> 01:12:26,346
I ll Kick you in the ass.

698
01:12:27,467 --> 01:12:31,993
I ll do something funny, I
ll brake one of that...

699
01:12:34,866 --> 01:12:36,801
What if don't arrived before?

700
01:12:37,091 --> 01:12:39,621
I know all of your story

701
01:12:39,656 --> 01:12:42,062
The man that began to
shoot in the restaurant

702
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:45,839
He visited the store of weapons
that you inherited from your papa

703
01:12:46,324 --> 01:12:52,052
Your you sold him the shotgun that
killed your wife and son

704
01:12:52,598 --> 01:12:55,884
I won't tell you anything,
you God damned fucker

705
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,064
Where are you, Smith?

706
01:13:03,428 --> 01:13:05,172
