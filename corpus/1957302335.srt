You must listen to me because
I am a vampire slayer.

1464
01:03:25,364 --> 01:03:27,366
The vampires
are very dangerous.

1465
01:03:27,399 --> 01:03:29,401
They will kill you.

1466
01:03:29,435 --> 01:03:32,639
He will suck your blood.
He could be after your wife.

1467
01:03:32,672 --> 01:03:35,007
You have a wife. I know that.
I've seen her.

1468

She have a nice ass.
No disrespect.

01:03:36,676 --> 01:03:38,610
Tell me about these niggas,
please. What did he look like?

1470
01:03:38,645 --> 01:03:40,612
He's bite-size,
he's real short.

1471
01:03:40,647 --> 01:03:42,147
How short is he?

1472
01:03:42,181 --> 01:03:44,116
He's short. He's... he's,
you know, he's...

1473
01:03:44,149 --> 01:03:45,617
Between you and this nigga,
where is he?

1474
01:03:45,652 --> 01:03:47,219
Like this way? This way?
That way? Under the table?

1475
01:03:47,252 --> 01:03:48,987
- Pocket size.
- Pocket size nigga?

1476
01:03:49,021 --> 01:03:50,556
He got like a little perm.

1477
01:03:50,589 --> 01:03:52,759
He looked like that
little man on the dime.

1478
01:03:52,792 --> 01:03:54,493
- What dime?
- The dime.

1479

1484
01:04:05,537 --> 01:04:07,573
I would take Donald Trump.

1485
01:04:07,606 --> 01:04:11,410
The question is now he's trying
to take your family away,

1486
01:04:11,443 --> 01:04:13,512
- what are you are gonna do?
- [both] Hey, hey, hey!

1487

We're not the vampire.
You don't have to keep putting that on us.
