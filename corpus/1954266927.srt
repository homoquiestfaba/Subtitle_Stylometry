EVERYTHING TO LOSE

2
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,176
Welcome to Bickleton, New Jersey. 

3
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,450
Bickleton occupies less than 7km ², 

4
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,253
but is home 
for more than 26,000 people. 

5
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,894
We have the typical Main Street, 
 Lions Club 

6
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,456
 and reputable schools, 
 of the nursery. 12 years. 

7
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,698
But the great attraction of Bickleton 
 is the proximity of the city. 

8
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,459
In 35 minutes I can go 
 of my living room 

9
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,730
Times Square, 
 depending on traffic. 
10
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,532
. I have lived here all my life.

11
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,332
Fuck you, clown!

00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,894
part of the furniture I already do 
 this community. 

13
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,932
My name is Adam  Harris
 and this was my life. 

14
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,899
My grandfather served in U.S.S. Missouri 
 in World War II. 

15
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,779
He told me stories 
 whenever we visited. 

16
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,688
 Stories of pain and triumph 
 and leaving the country proud.
17
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,131
 it means to be a hero. 

18

32
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:46,571
. As we lived at home, income, and .

33
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:50,294
. Life was beautiful, since each .
 do their part. .

34
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:54,052

. and it was always in front .
 an open window, .

43
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:18,971
. so we could see. .

44
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:25,974
. After high school, Chico would .
 to California to make movies, .

45
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:30,138
. and fornicating with models. If anyone .
 in the city was able, he was. .

46
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:33,649
Pay attention, guys.
Unfortunately, the hearing is over ..

47
00:03:33,779 --> 00:03:35,735
. But after ten unsuccessful auditions, .

48
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:38,851
. Chico returned to work .

. my other friends started .
 to have full time jobs. .

50
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:45,656
. I do not. I was accepted at a school .
 in New York. .

51
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:48,335
. What I wanted was to meet girls. .

52
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:51,848
I already have a drink
and she will pay the next round.

53
00:03:52,778 --> 00:03:56,168
. When not apparent, .
 had to go to plan B. .

54
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,811
Were you drinking?

55
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:29,093
A bit.

56
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:34,091
This is it, dear.

57
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:38,771
You know you want to come
for me, Adam.

58
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:44,571
., without more, .
 was hooked. .

59
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:47,011
Another 10 seconds.

60
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:52,488
Campus security!
Open the door!

61
00:04:52,618 --> 00:04:55,178
Hope you money
for bail.

62
00:04:55,298 --> 00:04:56,526
. Well, did not. .

63
00:04:56,738 --> 00:05:00,492
. She went to jail .
 and I was expelled from university. .

64
00:05:04,258 --> 00:05:05,532
. Okay. .

65
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:09,094
. was again with my friends, .
 to live the dream in Jersey. .

66
00:05:09,338 --> 00:05:12,057
- Don, you will come or not?
- How's the water?

67
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,567
- Wet. Come in, geek.
- Okay.

68
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:22,693
- I know Chico fornicate?
- No. What have you been doing this chrome?

69
00:05:22,818 --> 00:05:26,288
- Now it does nothing. He killed himself.
- Chico's dead?

70
00:05:26,418 --> 00:05:29,490
He was caught by a train.
They say it was an accident.

71
00:05:29,618 --> 00:05:32,496
How? The train was his home
and picked it up?

72
00:05:32,618 --> 00:05:36,293
Everyone knows that the trains
spend all hours. Think!

73
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:38,693
I saw him at a party a few weeks ago.

74
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,691
He said that his life
was in chaos.

75
00:05:42,858 --> 00:05:45,088
Fuck it, we are still
all alive, right?

76
00:05:45,218 --> 00:05:47,686
As we did not catch him
with trains.

77
00:05:47,818 --> 00:05:48,773
To us.

78
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:51,969
- At undercooked hamburger.
- And to smoke weed.

79
00:05:52,097 --> 00:05:54,247
Gentlemen, to pornography.

80
00:05:55,217 --> 00:05:58,414
To a group of normal types,
fighting the good fight,

81
00:05:59,577 --> 00:06:02,410
they do not give up
nor allow themselves to fall.

82
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:04,847
We have seen our dose
Scene sanded,

83
00:06:04,977 --> 00:06:07,332
but we have come this far.
- It's true.

84
00:06:07,457 --> 00:06:10,096
Malta, the better that this is impossible.

85
00:06:10,217 --> 00:06:11,650
To our boys.

86
00:06:11,977 --> 00:06:15,208
- Who is in my pool?
- Shit! Let's go!

87
00:06:15,337 --> 00:06:18,488
- Bring the beer!
- It's my grill? Pirem from here!

88
00:06:18,617 --> 00:06:19,606
Come here!

89
00:06:20,817 --> 00:06:22,296
You know the problem?

90
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:25,295
Too many people believe
in certain institutions

91
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:27,692
unconditionally.
As the university.

92
00:06:27,817 --> 00:06:31,446
Do not say it is not good,
but it is not unconditionally good.

93
00:06:31,577 --> 00:06:35,729
Walking in college means nothing,
if you do not know why there stilts.

94
00:06:35,857 --> 00:06:38,291
Everyone says that you have
to go to college

95
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:41,966
because the system does
brainwashing people.

96
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:45,009
However, the price of tuition
rises every year.

97
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:47,890
It is big business
that perpetuates itself.

98
00:06:48,017 --> 00:06:50,451
- Do you know what the saddest part?
- What is it?

99
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,694
Have customers
to advertise for them.

100
00:06:54,657 --> 00:06:56,807
"You have to go to university."

101
00:06:56,937 --> 00:06:58,052
Fuck you!

102
00:06:59,097 --> 00:07:01,657
You're the stupid type
smartest I know.

103
00:07:01,777 --> 00:07:04,132
. That's what I wanted .
 No, not really. .

104
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,610
. But it could be worse. .

105
00:07:08,017 --> 00:07:10,850
- How are you, Adam?
- Hello, Mrs. Primrose.

106
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:14,447
.- What would you like today?
- How about a muffin  . blueberry?</i>

107
00:07:14,777 --> 00:07:15,926
Sounds good.

108
00:07:19,697 --> 00:07:20,766
Thanks.

109
00:07:22,497 --> 00:07:24,772
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

110
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,774
- Bye.
- Have a nice day.

111
00:07:43,217 --> 00:07:47,654
Adam! Call an ambulance
quickly, the old lady got hit!

112
00:07:47,777 --> 00:07:49,653
Ambulance calls soon!

113
00:07:53,096 --> 00:07:54,085
. 112. .

114
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:56,684
I'm in Ami's Bagels,
196, Main Street.

115
00:07:56,816 --> 00:07:59,376
Send an ambulance,
a lady was hit.

116
00:07:59,496 --> 00:08:01,327
Forget it.
Has no head.

117
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:03,415
Has no head.

118
00:08:03,696 --> 00:08:05,209
You gotta see this.

119
00:08:05,576 --> 00:08:07,567
. I worked for the Israelis. .

120
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:11,291
. That beast was Uri, .
 the younger brother of my boss. .

121
00:08:11,776 --> 00:08:14,006
. Working with Uri .
 was plotted. .

122
00:08:14,136 --> 00:08:17,970
I was in a bar last night
where some girls were dancing.

123
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:21,566
They were so beautiful.
They had breasts the size of babies.

124
00:08:21,696 --> 00:08:23,607
. Uri was very arrogant. .

125
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,170
.Just wanted to know  women .
 and money. .

126
00:08:26,296 --> 00:08:28,014
. He did anything for them. .

127
00:08:28,136 --> 00:08:31,287
Hundred dollars to go to bed
with the next customer.

128
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,849
Go away, Uri.

129
00:08:32,976 --> 00:08:36,685
.Hundred dollars as the next customer
asks  bagel . with poppy seeds.</i>

130
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,410
Hundred dollars to kill you
before the end of turn.

131
00:08:39,536 --> 00:08:41,845
Fuck you!
I am Israeli, I kill you!

132
00:08:41,976 --> 00:08:45,571
Stop eating the egg salad.
Ami is losing money with you.

133
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:48,335
Fuck you, I have to see
it is good.

134
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:50,851
I think I see a rat.

Two hours, no butter
and without cream cheese.

143
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,054
As a ham for 70.

144
00:09:16,176 --> 00:09:18,895
No, the ham is too expensive,
Ami was killing me.

145

- And if you drink this oil?
- Still die, man.

152
00:09:37,136 --> 00:09:38,535
The salary of a week.

153

What? You bet I ate,
I have not eaten, so I'm not paid.

158
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,971
A bet does not work like that!

159
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:05,574

- Shit!
- What?

164

00:11:06,335 --> 00:11:09,611
Why must bad things happen
to good people?

173
00:11:27,095 --> 00:11:28,813
. I was fascinated. .

174
00:11:29,535 --> 00:11:32,732
.The knowledge was  .
 stored in this piece .

175
00:11:32,855 --> 00:11:36,370
. What can know about someone .
 from a piece of brain .

176
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,850
. Brain is equal to many questions. .

177
00:11:38,975 --> 00:11:41,250

You're disrespecting the memory
and her whole life, you idiot!

. Uri was Ami's brother, ie, .
 I would be fired and ready. .

199
00:13:14,174 --> 00:13:16,529
. But Uri was illegal in this country. .

00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:39,568
- Any idiot does that job.

00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,845
Do not pay bills with ham,
your asshole!

209
00:13:42,974 --> 00:13:45,009

210
00:13:45,173 --> 00:13:46,686

Me and your father talked and let you
live here without pagares income

216
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:05,167
You're not helping.

- So now I have to pay rent?
- No, you have to leave home.

- Do not believe it!
- Woe to you?

222
00:14:21,573 --> 00:14:24,929

You're welcome.

282
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,880
Carlson heard of Frankie?

283

He was working at Sizzler ..

284
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,928
- Not Sizzler, Steak and Ale is.
- Does it matter?

285
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,769
Anyway, was closed
and were clean.

286
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:09,609
Two types knocking at the door
and ask to go to the bathroom.

287
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:13,200
Frankie let them enter
and lean on him a gun to his head.

288
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:17,084
Frankie forced to open the safe and
put us in the fridge.

289
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,600
- Were there girls?
- Man, could have died frozen.

290
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,643
- Well done, went into the fridge!
- What were you doing in relation to the gun?

291
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,681
Did I say what I should do it.

292
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:31,123
Spim, lay your hand to me,
as if you were targeting me. Come on!

293
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,322
What you have to do is grab
this hand, twisting it

294
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,680
and using the elbow as well.
- Okay.

295
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,278
Caught in the gun
and you give him on the face.

296
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,321
Okay, my! Stop!

If they bite me,
bite up to you.

300
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,482
- The dog is outside.
- Don 't be clever with me.

301
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:55,683

Whats there to drink?

The sweetener does not cause cancer?
Your curtains do not match.

No girls?
This is some Greek orgy?

316
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:42,526
We're just playing cards.

317
00:21:42,649 --> 00:21:44,844

But it is by 235.

. that began two years ago. .

341
00:22:56,489 --> 00:22:58,241
He looks like a cockroach.

342
00:22:59,649 --> 00:23:03,528
The problem is that when there
an infestation of cockroaches,

343
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:09,963
a crush and there are a hundred more
hidden in the shadows.

344
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:16,168
What this city needs
is an exterminator.

345
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:28,397
. The more I thought about it, .
 did I realize more. .

00:23:50,808 --> 00:23:52,878
Wait just a moment, okay?

353
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,959
Where can I get the uniform?
My size is S.

Thinks it can
Police make it?

355

You must go to school,
in academia

356
00:24:03,848 --> 00:24:05,839
and then can become police.

357
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:09,161

. ate a dozen eggs, bacon, .
 sausages, frozen waffles. .

. But it was impossible to find them. .

383
00:26:56,327 --> 00:26:58,363
Hello Mona is?

384
00:26:59,687 --> 00:27:00,756
No.

385
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:04,282
Okay.

386
00:27:06,287 --> 00:27:07,720
Can tell you ..

You got that monster, the Pope.

389
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,525
Mona came out with a friend.

390
00:27:20,927 --> 00:27:22,076

You should have killed that bastard.

Father?

394
00:27:57,526 --> 00:27:59,164
Can you teach me to fight?

395
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:04,964
Even a strong man has
their limitations.

396
00:29:05,726 --> 00:29:07,079
Go to the phone.

397
00:29:07,886 --> 00:29:08,955
It is Mona.

398
00:29:21,286 --> 00:29:22,924
An important meeting?

399
00:29:23,486 --> 00:29:24,760
It is not important.

400
00:29:25,286 --> 00:29:26,514
Not a date.

401
00:29:28,246 --> 00:29:30,282
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:35,840
Hello

Sorry for having to bring the car.
My mother had to go to work.

404
00:29:40,765 --> 00:29:41,993
No problem.

405
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:45,000
Where are we going?

406
00:29:49,005 --> 00:29:51,644
- With the phone is bigger the tip.
- Thanks.

407
00:29:51,765 --> 00:29:53,403
How is it, boy?

408
00:29:54,005 --> 00:29:56,883
Where have you been? Do not have time
to call me, fool?

409
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:59,963
I always have time
to call you fool.

410
00:30:00,285 --> 00:30:03,038
Greek, this is Mona.
Mona, this is George the Greek.

- Yes.

414
00:30:09,925 --> 00:30:10,880
Come on.

415
00:30:11,005 --> 00:30:12,233
Here you are.

416
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:23,876
- I was happy to connect.
- My dad said you spent there.

417
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:25,199
And passed.

418
00:30:25,525 --> 00:30:28,323
I know I did not think
he was lying.

419
00:30:28,645 --> 00:30:29,873
Well, of course.

420
00:30:35,205 --> 00:30:36,604
Tell me about yourself.

421
00:30:40,765 --> 00:30:43,279
Okay. I have 25 years e. .

422
00:30:46,325 --> 00:30:48,793

I measure 1.80m, but sometimes I say
I measure 1.77 m.

424
00:30:58,525 --> 00:30:59,480
Okay.

425
00:30:59,725 --> 00:31:01,841
Want to know the dishes of the day?

426
00:31:02,285 --> 00:31:04,435
It's a lie, no dishes of the day.
What do you want?

427
00:31:04,565 --> 00:31:07,682
.- Do me a favor, do not ask  gyros .
- Okay.</i>

428
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:12,764
- Why not ask for me?
- Okay.

429
00:31:14,325 --> 00:31:18,398
We want two hamburgers
with cheese and baked potato

430
00:31:18,805 --> 00:31:21,160
with cream sauce
and extra butter.

431
00:31:21,285 --> 00:31:24,357
Cream of broccoli
toasted bread with extra ..

432
00:31:25,205 --> 00:31:28,197
And for the girl,
a tuna sandwich.

433
00:31:32,365 --> 00:31:33,480
You got it.

434
00:31:36,564 --> 00:31:38,122
Are you a social worker?

435
00:31:38,484 --> 00:31:42,841
I am taking a master's degree at Brown.
I came to the funeral of my Aunt Grace.

436
00:31:42,964 --> 00:31:44,875
My condolences for your aunt.

437
00:31:45,044 --> 00:31:46,193
Thank you.

438
00:31:47,524 --> 00:31:49,242
She went to my grocery store.

439
00:31:50,364 --> 00:31:52,355
It seemed like a good person.

440
00:31:57,404 --> 00:31:58,439
Are you okay?

441
00:32:01,204 --> 00:32:03,877
Question to my children
in 20 years.

442
00:32:18,484 --> 00:32:19,473
Father

443
00:32:21,684 --> 00:32:23,914
The mother says that you want to talk to me.

444
00:32:25,324 --> 00:32:27,235
I want to show you something.

445
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:43,394
We started the night patrols
on April 69.

446
00:32:44,284 --> 00:32:46,752
There was nobody
to take care of us.

447
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:50,320
Fuck it. Invent.
We take care of each other.

448
00:32:51,564 --> 00:32:56,115
But the jungle was the hole
more dark and scary

449
00:32:56,244 --> 00:32:58,838
I've never seen.

450
00:33:00,404 --> 00:33:04,363
Sometimes we spent weeks
without seeing a bastard of a chino.

451
00:33:05,044 --> 00:33:07,877
But we always knew
they were there.

452
00:33:08,924 --> 00:33:10,152
Everywhere.

453
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:12,552
Nowhere.

00:33:20,524 --> 00:33:22,833
.It's a radio scanner  .</i>

455
00:33:23,524 --> 00:33:26,914
The police use the 477.16 channel.

456
00:33:32,364 --> 00:33:34,831
I thought it might help you, son.

457
00:33:46,963 --> 00:33:48,191
How is it, man?

458
00:33:49,003 --> 00:33:50,152
What is this?

459
00:33:51,043 --> 00:33:53,796
It's for my new job ..
Security.

460
00:33:53,923 --> 00:33:56,676
Really? You must tell us
where you work,

461
00:33:56,803 --> 00:33:59,112
for us to go plunder the site.

462
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:13,798
You know ..

Well .

467
00:34:24,643 --> 00:34:26,918
This is difficult to explain, but ..

468
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:30,320
.. 've been having some ideas.

469
00:34:30,963 --> 00:34:32,316
What kind of ideas?

470
00:34:35,563 --> 00:34:36,712
Say ..

471
00:34:38,123 --> 00:34:42,833
.. I look around me
and feel that someone should do something.

472
00:34:45,203 --> 00:34:46,522
Compared to what?

473
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,113
Compared .. things.

474
00:34:50,203 --> 00:34:51,238
In the city.

475
00:34:53,643 --> 00:34:54,837
I do not know, man.

476

've Been having some crazy ideas.

477
00:34:57,843 --> 00:34:59,959
You have always been weird, man.

478
00:35:01,723 --> 00:35:03,634
Shit, I love this song.

479
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,116
I'll turn up the volume.

480
00:35:07,603 --> 00:35:10,197
You're great, man.
I was talking with Don

481
00:35:10,323 --> 00:35:13,679
He meets a kind
who knows of a party in Lodi.

482
00:35:13,803 --> 00:35:15,998
There must be women. Will you?

483
00:35:19,443 --> 00:35:21,115
I will not go to parties.

484
00:35:22,323 --> 00:35:23,517

00:36:03,122 --> 00:36:06,831
- Can I help with anything?
- Stand back, please.

489
00:36:07,242 --> 00:36:09,198
It's just a criminal or is there more?

490
00:36:10,362 --> 00:36:13,274
Thanks,
but we have everything under control.

491
00:36:13,402 --> 00:36:15,154

496
00:36:28,202 --> 00:36:29,840
Not in this car.

497
00:36:33,682 --> 00:36:35,240
Are you kidding or what?

498
00:36:41,202 --> 00:36:42,760
Hands behind your back.

499
00:36:44,442 --> 00:36:46,751
They arrested me for starting the car?

500
00:36:47,002 --> 00:36:49,596
No, hold up
for being an asshole.

501
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:53,034
Is that a crime?
What is the police code for this?

502
00:36:53,162 --> 00:36:54,880
And to be tattooed on their forehead?

503
00:36:55,002 --> 00:36:57,562
Can you give us a few seconds;
please?

504
00:36:58,322 --> 00:36:59,437
Thanks.

505
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:07,201
I think he can not
deal with the stress of this job.

506
00:37:07,322 --> 00:37:10,155
- I on the other side ..
- Stop! Shut up.

507
00:37:10,282 --> 00:37:12,716
I see what you are
going, Adam.

508
00:37:12,842 --> 00:37:16,073
You helped us to hold
a very dangerous predator.

509
00:37:16,202 --> 00:37:19,160
And you became excited.
I understand that.

510
00:37:20,002 --> 00:37:22,960
But that does not make you
a professional law.

511
00:37:23,682 --> 00:37:24,831
That's what makes.

512
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:26,834
So give me one of those.

513
00:37:26,962 --> 00:37:31,000
It is dangerous and illegal to walk around
chasing criminals.

514
00:37:31,921 --> 00:37:34,958
I am willing to forget this
If you promise

515
00:37:35,081 --> 00:37:38,437
do not you put the laps
in the affairs of the police.

516
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:42,520
I appreciate what you're doing,
but the city is small.

517
00:37:42,641 --> 00:37:44,199
We do the trick.

518
00:37:45,921 --> 00:37:48,481
- Can I go?
- Yes, you can go.

519
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:05,918
- What the ..?
- Damn!

520
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:08,713
What are you doing here?

521
00:38:08,841 --> 00:38:10,672
We are your friends, remember?

522
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:14,591
Let the house of Don Get dressed.
The car is on, you have 5 minutes.

523
00:38:14,721 --> 00:38:17,110
You can not refuse.
Coming with us.

524
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:19,076
Anda.

525
00:38:31,161 --> 00:38:34,597
Shit! How is it, guys?
Where have you been, bro?

526
00:38:34,721 --> 00:38:35,995
I've been there.

527
00:38:36,121 --> 00:38:39,238
I know, do not you walk with us,
but you walk around.

528
00:38:39,361 --> 00:38:43,274
- I do not want to know of your friends?
- You started without me?

529
00:38:44,801 --> 00:38:46,678
What the hell are you doing?

530
00:38:46,881 --> 00:38:50,112
Adam told me about a club
in Jersey City ..

531
00:38:50,481 --> 00:38:51,596
How do I look?

532
00:38:51,721 --> 00:38:54,110
.You okay,
taking that shirt  gay .</i>

533
00:38:54,241 --> 00:38:57,199
.- What about the shirt?
- It's the shirt more  gay . I've seen.</i>

534

.The two types is less  fornicate gay .
this shirt!</i>

535
00:39:00,241 --> 00:39:03,039
Guilt is the mother of Don,
it was she who bought ma.

536
00:39:03,161 --> 00:39:06,790
- We went to school or what?
- Yes, taking the cocaine.

537
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:09,911
Who you got it? The Vic?

538
00:39:10,201 --> 00:39:11,919
Someone told me?

539
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:14,072
Look, it's the "G Squad"!

540
00:39:14,481 --> 00:39:18,474
Nice shirt, Greek. Bet
that engages many guys with that

541
00:39:19,081 --> 00:39:21,675
They brought their wallets, their pussies?

542
00:39:22,521 --> 00:39:23,590
No.

543
00:39:24,481 --> 00:39:26,437
No, I'll go crazy.

544
00:39:26,561 --> 00:39:28,472
- No!
- Do not!

545
00:39:28,681 --> 00:39:31,194
Try it.
Vic, you get yourself a bit?

546
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,675
Sure.
Try before you buy.

547
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,268
- I do not want.
- This is it.

548
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,437
- Come on, man! You do lose.
- Pressure from friends ..

549
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,676
Do not be a woman

550
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,190
Do not touch it. If you can not
to fornicate, do not want.

551
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,629
Good thing you never do.

552
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,993
.What's your excuse,  cowboy .?
Be a man.</i>

553
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,399
Walk to train.

554
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,473
For the Paralympic Games?
No, just kidding.

555
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,398
It is obvious that you exercise.
How much lift?

556
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,194
How much lift?
110? 130 pounds?

557
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,315
Just trying to help you, dude.

558
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,194
Do not be ashamed, we are only
two men talking about bench press.

559
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,519
.Thus, get you steroids.
 Andro, The Clear. .

560
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,791
Get you depressed,
if you have fear of injecting.

561
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,397
You like porn?
I know you love to hit one.

562
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,439
He's laughing.

563
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,438
I got sick shit bro.

00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,630
I have a Cuban

565
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,749
What?

566
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,111
I'm kidding, it's a horse
painted zebra.

567
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,189
What is yours, mine?

568
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,273
That is $ 80.

569
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,351
Calm down.
He is cool, Vic.

570
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,789
Fuck you, do not tell me
to relax.

571
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,672
It is I who decide who is cool.

572
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,711
Come on, Vic, was an accident.

573
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,752
.- So are you, papa gyros  . of shit!

574
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,472

- Vic, we're friends.
- Fuck, this is business.

576
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,076
Pay me $ 80 now!

577
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,835

Not having to go ask
at your mothers.

579
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,033
Tell her that spilled
cocaine throughout.

580
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,515
Now!

581
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,598
Okay. My God, Vic,
speaks softly.

582
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,915
Shit!

583
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,190
Don 't be clever with me.

584
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,515
My God!

585
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,437
- Where you going?
- Let him go.

586
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,832
. My father was right, .
 this city is full of cockroaches. .

587
00:41:29,399 --> 00:41:31,674
. But Vic was more than a cockroach, .

588
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,638
. he was a cancer. .

589
00:41:33,919 --> 00:41:35,716
. consume this city. .

590
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:56,668
. He went from Manhattan to Brooklyn, .
 returned to the Bronx. .

591
00:43:57,558 --> 00:43:59,037
. stretch of line. .

592
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:03,677
. would pick the 7 to Queens .
 or J to Bed Stuy and Brownsville. .

593
00:44:03,998 --> 00:44:06,592
.The worst neighborhoods  .
 to remember me. .

594
00:44:07,118 --> 00:44:10,394
. Night after night, .
 this became my routine. .

595
00:44:14,158 --> 00:44:16,467
Sir, sir!

596
00:44:17,518 --> 00:44:20,078
I think you missed
your stop.

597
00:44:54,478 --> 00:44:56,070
Die, motherfucker!

598
00:44:59,118 --> 00:45:02,315
You have to be prepared
for anything.

599
00:45:05,118 --> 00:45:06,790
Got your mail here.

600
00:45:15,918 --> 00:45:19,706
Not finished your story.
Why you out of school?

601
00:45:20,638 --> 00:45:23,072
Apparently they have
something called "rules."

602
00:45:23,198 --> 00:45:26,109
- I think I broke them.
- Hellion.

603
00:45:27,277 --> 00:45:30,394
- Have you ever thought you reapply?
- No.

604
00:45:31,037 --> 00:45:33,153
I was not done for the university.

605
00:45:33,277 --> 00:45:37,156
Not everyone can be doctors,
lawyers, social workers.

606
00:45:37,277 --> 00:45:39,837
Some people have to do
the dirty work.

607
00:45:39,957 --> 00:45:41,754
This is a total coward.

608
00:45:43,397 --> 00:45:45,547
I wish I could stay in school.

609
00:45:45,717 --> 00:45:48,789
- How so?
- I'll stop for a few semesters.

610
00:45:49,637 --> 00:45:50,752
My father ..

611
00:45:52,837 --> 00:45:54,907
My dad needs me at home.

612
00:45:56,237 --> 00:45:58,353
And he was able to ask you this?

613
00:45:58,837 --> 00:46:00,111
He is my father.

614
00:46:00,837 --> 00:46:03,476
Do not want to deal with it,
but I have to do.

615
00:46:03,597 --> 00:46:05,553
My God, how old are you?

616
00:46:05,917 --> 00:46:08,750
.How long does it take to put
 a wonton . on a plate?</i>

617
00:46:08,877 --> 00:46:10,276
Let me help you.

618
00:46:10,397 --> 00:46:13,992
Yeah, right. There should be laws
against people like you.

619
00:46:14,117 --> 00:46:18,269
First Law, out of my way!
Second law, learn English. Say:

620
00:46:18,397 --> 00:46:22,151
"The Vic makes my nipples
Yellow hard. "Can you?

621
00:46:25,517 --> 00:46:28,509
What made you decide to go
the funeral of my aunt?

622
00:46:29,197 --> 00:46:31,347
I was the last person
with whom she spoke.

623
00:46:31,477 --> 00:46:33,035
What did she say?

624
00:46:35,117 --> 00:46:36,266
She said ..

625
00:46:37,997 --> 00:46:39,396
"Thank you, Adam."

626
00:46:44,957 --> 00:46:47,346
You were there when my aunt died

627
00:46:47,477 --> 00:46:50,833
and two days later you got
the guy who attacked me.

628
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,633
It's a great coincidence, is not it?

629
00:46:54,717 --> 00:46:56,833
Yes, maybe I should give chance.

630
00:46:57,437 --> 00:47:00,509
No, I think that was
destined to happen.

631
00:47:01,797 --> 00:47:02,946
Be right back.

632
00:47:03,517 --> 00:47:06,156
- Where you going?
- Search for the duck sauce.

633
00:47:09,077 --> 00:47:13,195
- Sorry, I need sauce.
- Take, dear, they do more.

634
00:47:23,557 --> 00:47:25,512
What? She is with you?

635
00:47:27,796 --> 00:47:30,071
- Hello, my name is Vic.
- I'm Mona.

636
00:47:30,196 --> 00:47:31,470
Are you?

637
00:47:33,516 --> 00:47:34,949
You're going to the movies?

638
00:47:35,076 --> 00:47:38,273
It's just that I have everything on DVD,
with good quality.

639
00:47:38,596 --> 00:47:40,985
- Good. Thanks.
- Whatever.

640
00:47:41,116 --> 00:47:44,870
- I go to the bathroom.
- It's back there, baby, on the left.

641
00:47:45,636 --> 00:47:48,025
Mona .. Look at that.

642
00:47:49,156 --> 00:47:50,908
It is good to "mona"?

643
00:47:52,516 --> 00:47:56,794
Fuck that this is a chick raped?
Uncle Vic never experienced before.

644
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:58,395
It recreates the situation?

645
00:48:01,876 --> 00:48:02,991
Well ..

646
00:48:03,556 --> 00:48:07,674
Anyway, I would not put her
where Richard Pope has been.

647
00:48:08,596 --> 00:48:10,188
Nutty bastard.

648
00:48:10,316 --> 00:48:13,547
- Eight dollars? Keep the change.
- Enjoy.

649
00:48:14,996 --> 00:48:16,315
See you, dude.

650
00:48:19,036 --> 00:48:20,310
What a freak!

651
00:48:21,676 --> 00:48:22,791
My God!

652
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:25,265
Thank you.

653
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:32,314
- Thanks for dinner.
- It was a pleasure. Thanks for the ride.

654
00:48:32,436 --> 00:48:35,712
My mother needed the car
to go bowling.

655
00:48:35,836 --> 00:48:37,906
Are you 25 years, get a car.

656
00:48:38,956 --> 00:48:40,947
That guy knocked on your door!

657
00:48:41,076 --> 00:48:42,794
Forget it, it was just a touch.

658
00:48:50,076 --> 00:48:53,227
Look, hit the car of my friend
with the door.

659
00:48:53,396 --> 00:48:54,875
We're sorry.

660
00:49:08,036 --> 00:49:09,947
What are you doing?
Save it.

661
00:49:10,076 --> 00:49:12,988
Have you paid the dinner,
not have to pay for petrol.

662
00:49:13,356 --> 00:49:15,631
Ten dollars from 95 normal, please.

663
00:49:15,756 --> 00:49:18,634
Do not fill the tank
with better gasoline.

664
00:49:18,836 --> 00:49:20,667
Adam, what are you doing?

665
00:49:23,196 --> 00:49:24,230
Why?

666
00:49:26,795 --> 00:49:28,467
Has the dirty windshield.

667
00:49:29,235 --> 00:49:30,714
Lazy shit.

668
00:49:37,955 --> 00:49:39,434
They are 36.18 dollars.

669
00:49:46,755 --> 00:49:49,633
- As was said?
- 36.18.

670
00:49:51,035 --> 00:49:52,150
How much?

671
00:49:52,275 --> 00:49:54,550
38.18, has a hearing problem?

672
00:49:54,675 --> 00:49:57,633
No. You have a hearing problem,
clown?

673
00:49:57,755 --> 00:49:59,711
Shit, are you!

674
00:50:04,675 --> 00:50:07,314
Spim, this is Mona.
Mona, this is Spim.

675
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:12,504
- Never seen you.
- We were at the Chinese Buffet.

676
00:50:12,995 --> 00:50:14,587
What a fine!

677
00:50:16,715 --> 00:50:18,910
I'm still waiting for the 36.18.

678
00:50:19,915 --> 00:50:21,826
Are you charging me gasoline?

679
00:50:21,955 --> 00:50:24,867
This is a bomb,
where people buy gasoline.

680
00:50:24,995 --> 00:50:27,953
You see those prices?
Is the price of gasoline.

681
00:50:28,075 --> 00:50:30,384
Do not talk to me
as if three years.

682
00:50:30,515 --> 00:50:34,064
Okay, I speak as if you had
36.18, as it is you owe.

683
00:50:34,195 --> 00:50:36,231
This is because the other night?

684
00:50:36,435 --> 00:50:38,346
It is because of several things.

685
00:50:38,475 --> 00:50:42,832
You're out, Adam. Do not work,
you have nothing to offer,

686
00:50:42,955 --> 00:50:45,788
why should I risk being fired
only to help you?

687
00:50:45,915 --> 00:50:47,428
What I gain from this?

688
00:50:47,835 --> 00:50:49,314
We have no money.

689
00:50:51,595 --> 00:50:54,393
So you can not leave out of here.

690
00:51:18,355 --> 00:51:20,744
- How much do you owe?
- 36.18.

691
00:51:22,515 --> 00:51:25,551
$ 36 and 18 cents.
He filled the tank?

692
00:51:26,314 --> 00:51:28,111
Sorry that happened.

693
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:32,951
Borrowed money.
Want to go with dessert?

694
00:51:33,474 --> 00:51:35,066
I am very tired.

695
00:51:35,794 --> 00:51:38,149
You can catch a ride with your mother?

696
00:51:39,914 --> 00:51:41,029
Yes, of course.

697
00:51:43,314 --> 00:51:44,713
See you there.

698
00:51:45,834 --> 00:51:46,903
Great.

699
00:51:59,634 --> 00:52:02,387
. Don, can you confirm a price .
 box 2 .

700
00:52:02,514 --> 00:52:05,312
- Here's your change. Thanks.
- Thanks.

701
00:52:08,634 --> 00:52:09,669
CASE CLOSED

702
00:52:17,354 --> 00:52:19,345
Hello, Greek. Want a ride?

703
00:52:21,114 --> 00:52:22,547
- Yes.
- Come on.

704
00:52:25,354 --> 00:52:29,142
Thanks, man. Next time
that you come here, dinner is free.

705
00:52:30,954 --> 00:52:32,103
Agreed.

706
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:35,543
Do not exit properly out of his pocket.

707
00:52:41,874 --> 00:52:45,389
We no longer know where I live?
You should have turned left.

708
00:52:46,474 --> 00:52:48,430
You know what makes a good cop?

709
00:52:49,514 --> 00:52:50,629
Resources.

710
00:52:51,274 --> 00:52:53,265
You have many resources.

711
00:52:55,674 --> 00:52:58,984
Did you know that TJ Buck works
the Directorate General for Traffic?

712
00:52:59,114 --> 00:53:01,389
Good for him.
Where are we going?

713
00:53:01,634 --> 00:53:03,750
With that then I'm off, is not it?

714
00:53:04,554 --> 00:53:07,705
What do you think said Spim
I'm out.

715
00:53:16,154 --> 00:53:18,145
Adam, what the hell are you doing?

716
00:53:19,234 --> 00:53:20,428
My work.

717
00:53:36,793 --> 00:53:38,067
Hello, how are you?

718
00:53:39,033 --> 00:53:40,989
I'm fine. I know you?

719
00:53:41,913 --> 00:53:43,904
- Hello!
- Hello

720
00:53:44,753 --> 00:53:46,630
Your friends want a drink?

721
00:53:46,753 --> 00:53:50,712
We're not friends. Her husband
hit the car from my friend.

722
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:53,188
- And then freaked out.
- Really?

723
00:53:54,513 --> 00:53:55,866
Are the police or what?

724
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,712
I'm like a cop.

725
00:53:58,393 --> 00:53:59,508
Okay ..

726
00:54:00,073 --> 00:54:03,224
I'm busy.
Back to the car Mom

727
00:54:03,353 --> 00:54:05,708
and go away,
before they get hurt.

728
00:54:05,913 --> 00:54:07,107
I think not.

729
00:54:07,593 --> 00:54:08,787
Do not you think?

730
00:54:09,553 --> 00:54:13,387
- Maybe I can help.
- His tattoos do not scare me.

731
00:54:14,233 --> 00:54:16,588
You bastard!

732
00:54:17,033 --> 00:54:18,671
I'll call the police!

733
00:54:18,793 --> 00:54:22,468
This is what happens when
it is a beast in my town.

734
00:54:28,273 --> 00:54:30,343
You know what, Adam?
I walk.

735
00:54:33,513 --> 00:54:36,232
Tell them, Greek.
Tell others.

736
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:39,631
I have a function.
I'm not out.

737
00:54:44,153 --> 00:54:46,223
The Greek was the cry of the city.

738
00:54:46,353 --> 00:54:50,062
He had other and they decided
if they wanted to be part of the solution

739
00:54:50,193 --> 00:54:51,672
or part of the problem.

740
00:54:51,793 --> 00:54:55,149
God knows Bickleton
had enough problems.

741
00:54:55,633 --> 00:54:58,591
Hydroponics,
just want organic.

742
00:54:59,073 --> 00:55:02,463
I do not want anything that has to do
with the pharmaceutical industry.

743
00:55:04,273 --> 00:55:05,342
Adam!

744
00:55:06,233 --> 00:55:07,382
Telephone!

745
00:55:31,312 --> 00:55:33,143
Thanks for coming with me.

746
00:55:35,032 --> 00:55:36,147
Okay.

747
00:55:54,152 --> 00:55:56,586
Do not want to return for trial.

748
00:55:58,472 --> 00:56:01,862
The idea of ??returning to see his face
makes me sick.

749
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:05,506
Do not worry,
I'll be there with you.

750
00:56:05,912 --> 00:56:10,030
Sometimes I do not believe
that this happened to me.

751
00:56:11,032 --> 00:56:12,101
You know?

752
00:56:12,832 --> 00:56:16,347
It seems so distant and vague,

753
00:56:17,112 --> 00:56:19,945
who could swear
it was just a dream.

754
00:56:22,232 --> 00:56:23,426
A dream ..

755
00:56:24,752 --> 00:56:26,265
.. very realistic.

756
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:31,143
And then I become the victim.

757
00:56:32,672 --> 00:56:34,902
I'll always be that girl.

758
00:56:40,232 --> 00:56:42,746
Is not that what people
think of you.

759
00:56:44,272 --> 00:56:46,422
Not people like you.

760
00:58:46,071 --> 00:58:47,424
My wallet!

761
00:58:48,431 --> 00:58:51,628
Thief! Get him!
Someone who grabs!

762
00:59:10,791 --> 00:59:12,144
Put the wallet.

763
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:36,623
It's okay.

764
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:39,228
I'm a good Samaritan.

765
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:42,782
Have you got your wallet.

766
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:05,620
. There are casualties in all wars. .

767
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:07,783
. war my grandfather, .

768
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,619
. the war my father .
 and now, .

769
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:12,663
. in my war. .

770
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:24,502
VIGILANTE THE METRO
THIEF KILLS

771
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:27,908
We have a great country.

772
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:33,743
Even know how to treat
their heroes.

773
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:51,664
Gather round.

774
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:56,140
Seriously, take two more steps.

775
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:59,069
Why do you look for it?
I have what you want.

776
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:02,660
Are you afraid that you hurt?
If you wanted to, were already hurt.

777
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:05,589
I'm here every day.
Okay?

778
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:08,302
Why do you want to go there?

779
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:11,189
Because it is less
300 m of school

780
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:14,347
going to jail five years, Bronco.
Come here.

781
01:01:17,269 --> 01:01:18,497
They need?

782
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:22,745
- Two bags of grass.
- They are $ 20. It's simple.

783
01:01:26,069 --> 01:01:27,058
Toma.

784
01:01:30,629 --> 01:01:31,778
Go away.

785
01:01:33,229 --> 01:01:34,264
It looks good.

786
01:01:35,229 --> 01:01:36,457
Yes, it is good.

787
01:01:36,989 --> 01:01:38,627
Chaval disappears.

788
01:01:39,789 --> 01:01:41,825
There she is. Hello, dear.

789
01:01:43,509 --> 01:01:45,227
Here, let me see.

790
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:46,907
I love the equipment.

791
01:01:47,749 --> 01:01:49,102
Take a spin.

792
01:01:49,269 --> 01:01:50,827
Show me that ass.

793
01:01:50,949 --> 01:01:53,543
- You use this for me tonight?
- You know me.

794
01:01:53,669 --> 01:01:55,864
You'll not be able to ride more.

795
01:01:56,189 --> 01:01:58,657
- Are you good?
- How is it, dude?

796
01:01:59,589 --> 01:02:03,867
I thought you wanted to be
with someone your own age for once.

797
01:02:03,989 --> 01:02:05,104
Yes .

798
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:06,742
Kids, pirem up.

799
01:02:06,869 --> 01:02:09,906
Go do your homework.
Stay in school.

800
01:02:17,949 --> 01:02:19,462
Not owe me money.

801
01:02:21,269 --> 01:02:22,748
No, do not owe you anything.

802
01:02:23,829 --> 01:02:26,059
I'm not asking,
I'm saying.

803
01:02:26,189 --> 01:02:30,102
Not owe me, which is bad for me.
Everyone has a price and a vice.

804
01:02:30,229 --> 01:02:33,426
What do you need? I have detectors
radar, mobile phones ..

805
01:02:33,749 --> 01:02:34,864
Do not smoke weed?

806
01:02:36,109 --> 01:02:37,144
Smoked.

807
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:38,903
But I never bought it.

808
01:02:39,269 --> 01:02:40,497
Are these?

809
01:02:41,469 --> 01:02:42,458
Well ..

810
01:02:42,589 --> 01:02:46,707
I heard that you like prostitutes.
I know a brothel in Jersey City.

811
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:48,626
I can get you there.

812
01:02:49,069 --> 01:02:50,297
No thanks.

813
01:02:51,909 --> 01:02:52,978
Okay.

814
01:02:56,629 --> 01:02:58,426
We need to talk.

815
01:03:00,069 --> 01:03:01,138
Yes .

816
01:03:04,589 --> 01:03:06,500
I want you to miss the traffic.

817
01:03:08,429 --> 01:03:13,025
Dude, I'll just stop when you can
herb buy at the supermarket.

818
01:03:13,149 --> 01:03:14,741
I'm serious.

819
01:03:14,869 --> 01:03:18,543
Traffic is not cool,
especially with these kids.

820
01:03:20,228 --> 01:03:22,867
I think that would be of interest to stop.

821
01:03:27,388 --> 01:03:29,026
You know who was my father?

822
01:03:31,748 --> 01:03:33,625
It was the bookies.

823
01:03:34,428 --> 01:03:36,896
He had a client very stupid.

824
01:03:37,028 --> 01:03:41,226
The kind with some 30,000 lost
Betting stupidest ever made.

825
01:03:41,348 --> 01:03:44,704
Nobody told him to bet,
not much to bet,

826
01:03:44,828 --> 01:03:48,104
but how well it was stupid,
continued to bet.

827
01:03:48,508 --> 01:03:53,218
And instead of paying, as a man,
shot my father in the chest nine times.

828
01:03:53,348 --> 01:03:56,579
I saw my father die in the street,
in front of my house.

829
01:03:58,308 --> 01:04:00,219
This also is not right.

830
01:04:02,548 --> 01:04:04,425
These people to fuck off.

831
01:04:05,748 --> 01:04:07,420
And fuck you are you.

832
01:04:31,348 --> 01:04:33,100
I was not going to town ..

833
01:04:34,948 --> 01:04:36,620
.. if this type.

834
01:04:49,548 --> 01:04:53,223
. No problem, no need .
 back to town. .

835
01:04:54,428 --> 01:04:57,226
He had unfinished business
here.

836
01:05:35,587 --> 01:05:37,976
Adam, how's it going?

837
01:05:39,067 --> 01:05:42,503
Your friends are there.
Have you made peace?

838
01:05:42,747 --> 01:05:43,975
Where's Vic?

839
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:46,743
I do not know.
He walks around.

840
01:05:47,787 --> 01:05:49,982
Are you all right?

841
01:05:51,427 --> 01:05:54,225
Question to my children
in 20 years.

842
01:05:56,907 --> 01:05:58,659
Your turn, I have nothing.

843
01:05:58,787 --> 01:05:59,936
I have nothing.

844
01:06:00,067 --> 01:06:01,182
Give me.

845
01:06:01,387 --> 01:06:03,139
Look into it. Shit!

846
01:06:03,987 --> 01:06:05,022
What the hell!

847
01:06:06,107 --> 01:06:07,665
What a nice party!

848
01:06:10,227 --> 01:06:14,459
Come on, guys,
we are friends since childhood.

849
01:06:16,747 --> 01:06:20,626
- I need your help.
- Would you believe that you need help.

850
01:06:21,427 --> 01:06:24,385
See, this is what I have
been doing,

851
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:32,736
- This clown are you?
- I told you, he passed up!

852
01:06:33,387 --> 01:06:35,662
We should think this is cool?

853
01:06:37,267 --> 01:06:40,100
Listen, I know you like
Vic's,

854
01:06:40,547 --> 01:06:43,903
but it is bad wave,
sells drugs to kids.

855
01:06:44,427 --> 01:06:46,861
He is ruining our city.

856
01:06:47,787 --> 01:06:50,096
Let's take him out tonight.

857
01:06:55,627 --> 01:06:57,583
Okay, I get it.

858
01:06:58,667 --> 01:07:00,464
It was, to do the same.

859
01:07:02,307 --> 01:07:03,865
Useless crap.

860
01:07:07,467 --> 01:07:08,502
Vic!

861
01:07:12,747 --> 01:07:13,701
Vic!

862
01:07:19,746 --> 01:07:20,781
Vic!

863
01:07:22,466 --> 01:07:24,297
Who is calling me?

864
01:07:29,066 --> 01:07:30,624
Come outside with me.

865
01:07:31,226 --> 01:07:34,377
- What did you say, dude?
- Come with me out there.

866
01:07:34,946 --> 01:07:37,744
Sorry, honey,
only go out with women.

867
01:07:38,386 --> 01:07:39,705
Are you scared?

868
01:07:40,386 --> 01:07:45,255
Yes, I am afraid to kill you
and spend the rest of his life in jail.

869
01:07:45,746 --> 01:07:48,021
- Clown.
- A chicken shit!

870
01:07:48,546 --> 01:07:50,184
What did you say?

871
01:07:51,266 --> 01:07:52,494
You heard right.

872
01:07:52,666 --> 01:07:54,497
Its a chicken shit!

873
01:08:02,186 --> 01:08:03,744
Okay, let's go.

874
01:08:05,106 --> 01:08:07,540
In my house there.
Go outside.

875
01:08:21,506 --> 01:08:25,545
- Want to bet money?
- This has nothing to do with money.

876
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:28,943
You want to fight for the title?

877
01:08:35,466 --> 01:08:37,184
Tae kwon do, three years.

878
01:08:39,026 --> 01:08:40,220
Purple Belt.

879
01:08:42,546 --> 01:08:44,980
I was in the best 11 percent.

880
01:08:46,386 --> 01:08:48,377
Back up. Back up.

881
01:08:50,346 --> 01:08:51,779
Get back, damn it!

882
01:08:53,786 --> 01:08:55,014
My God!

883
01:08:56,306 --> 01:08:57,864
.Let's do it,  hippie .</i>

884
01:08:58,426 --> 01:08:59,541
Anda.

885
01:09:10,066 --> 01:09:11,465
Attacks, attacks.

886
01:09:34,465 --> 01:09:37,457
There, there, enough!

887
01:09:40,185 --> 01:09:42,460
Enough! Enough already!

888
01:09:43,665 --> 01:09:44,859
Enough.

889
01:09:48,585 --> 01:09:51,657
They go indoors
or disappear from here.

890
01:09:52,065 --> 01:09:54,135
I'm not kidding, seriously.

891
01:09:54,625 --> 01:09:55,694
Come on.

892
01:09:58,225 --> 01:10:00,580
I spent all this time to ask:

893
01:10:01,185 --> 01:10:04,382
"Why bad things happen
to good people? "

894
01:10:06,145 --> 01:10:07,737
Because we have left.

895
01:10:10,705 --> 01:10:11,854
Idiot!

896
01:10:12,865 --> 01:10:14,537
Shut up!

897
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:18,581
What are you talking about?

898
01:10:19,865 --> 01:10:21,583
You have mental problems.

899
01:10:28,905 --> 01:10:31,419
What?
You saved the world, hero?

900
01:10:32,305 --> 01:10:34,819
I tell you one thing,
not saved anything.

901
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:39,936
You think I'm a bad person?

902
01:10:41,785 --> 01:10:43,821
I provide a service.

903
01:10:47,425 --> 01:10:51,134
Let me tell you something,
this city needs me.

904
01:10:53,185 --> 01:10:54,857
Your father needs me.

905
01:10:57,905 --> 01:10:59,975
Then you are out, kid.

906
01:11:01,305 --> 01:11:04,263
Want to save someone?
Save thyself.

907
01:11:04,625 --> 01:11:05,740
Clown!

908
01:11:11,864 --> 01:11:13,820
He's crazy.

909
01:11:46,184 --> 01:11:48,982
He loved this city
was in Kansas,

910
01:11:49,224 --> 01:11:52,739
to be able to see a tornado
that takes everything ahead.

911
01:11:53,424 --> 01:11:54,539
Why?

912
01:11:55,384 --> 01:11:57,818
Not everything is bad.

913
01:12:00,184 --> 01:12:01,936
Tell me something good.

914
01:12:08,984 --> 01:12:10,781
I do not even know.

915
01:12:13,064 --> 01:12:15,419
I could tell you some stories.

916
01:12:16,064 --> 01:12:17,383
Trust me.

917
01:12:21,064 --> 01:12:22,702
You inspire me, Adam.

918
01:12:28,304 --> 01:12:31,296
The way you live the life
one day at a time.

919
01:12:32,984 --> 01:12:34,815
You play with the hand that you leave.

920
01:12:36,224 --> 01:12:37,543
Never get complaints.

921
01:12:40,744 --> 01:12:43,258
Seedlings things about you
you do not like.

922
01:12:44,664 --> 01:12:47,303
You leave behind
This does not take control.

923
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:51,141
You're stronger than you think.

924
01:12:53,184 --> 01:12:54,583
Stronger than me.

925
01:12:59,864 --> 01:13:00,979
And you're right.

926
01:13:03,024 --> 01:13:06,778
I can not let what happened
control my life.

927
01:13:07,424 --> 01:13:09,176
I was a victim, but ..

928
01:13:10,943 --> 01:13:12,740
.. I'm more than that.

929
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:21,412
The other day I was thinking,
while writing in my journal,

930
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:24,491
what people are like plants.

931
01:13:24,623 --> 01:13:28,775
Sometimes catching too much sun,
or too much shade,

932
01:13:29,463 --> 01:13:30,976
or too much rain.

933
01:13:31,383 --> 01:13:33,738
Then they are plucked,

934
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,017
cut

935
01:13:36,343 --> 01:13:37,742
footsteps.

936
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:42,541
But therein must appear
a gardener.

937
01:13:43,063 --> 01:13:44,815
To fix things.

938
01:13:46,943 --> 01:13:50,731
Even in the worst circumstances
something good can come.

939
01:13:53,143 --> 01:13:54,895
You also inspire me.

940
01:13:59,023 --> 01:14:01,662
Since our first night together.

941
01:14:17,943 --> 01:14:19,171
What is this?

942
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:25,378
I decided to return to university.

943
01:14:26,543 --> 01:14:28,101
That's great, Adam.

944
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:45,815
I am very happy for you.

945
01:15:12,542 --> 01:15:14,294
I know you need a flyer.

946
01:15:14,422 --> 01:15:17,653
It will be the biggest party
the university's history.

947
01:15:17,782 --> 01:15:19,898
Sorry, today I'm going to New Jersey.

948
01:15:20,022 --> 01:15:22,377
You'll see family
or girlfriend?

949
01:15:22,502 --> 01:15:25,938
The trial of rape
a friend of mine starts tomorrow.

950
01:15:27,702 --> 01:15:29,613
Next time.

951
01:15:31,622 --> 01:15:32,737
See you soon.

952
01:15:59,662 --> 01:16:00,936
Wait.

953
01:17:52,461 --> 01:17:53,689
Sorry.

954
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:21,060
I love you, honey.
Daddy loves you very much.

955
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:22,932
You are my precious angel.

956
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,738
Now you are safe.

957
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:59,257
. Why bad things happen .
 to good people? .

958
01:19:59,380 --> 01:20:03,259
. And when they happen, who will be there .
 to correct .

959
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:07,253
 I'll be there. .
