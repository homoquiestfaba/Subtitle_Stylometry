2
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:27,179
i've got to quit smoking.

3
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:30,949
So much for
new year's resolutions.

4
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,651
You really
fucked everything up,

5
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,386
didn't you, m.j.?

6
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:36,822
Amanda,
quit attacking me.

7
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:39,491
You have no idea
what i've been going through.

8
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,162
Fighting isn't getting us
anywhere, you guys.

9
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,465
Don't you think maybe
we should go look for her?

10
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:49,234
Maybe. I don't know.

11
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,303
What time is it anyway?

12
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:53,338
Just after 2:00.

13
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,240
And it looks like we're
gonna be here for a while.

14
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:57,442
Does anybody want
more coffee?

15
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,479
You certainly know how
to clear out a party.

16
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:03,549
Give it a rest, amanda.

17
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,317
Let's face it.

18
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:07,152
This isn't
the first time

19
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:09,121
you've ruined one of
our little soirées.

20
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,923
Oh, yeah?

21
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,591
For instance...

22
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,494
for instance,
your birthday.

23
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:19,765
Come on, everybody.
Let's surprise her.

24
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,767
1, 2, 3!

25
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:23,435
Surprise!
Happy birthday!

26
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:25,037
Happy birthday!

27
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:26,838
Happy birthday, m.j.

28
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:31,677
uh, henry,
meet my roommates.

29
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,111
My best friend
frankie...

30
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,446
hello, henry.

31
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:36,048
And her boyfriend
taylor.

32
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:37,583
And this is banks
and amanda.

33
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,084
Hi, henry.
How you doing?

34
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:42,287
Uh... i'm late.

35
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:44,223
I've got to get ready
for work.

36
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,391
Hey,
good morning, los angeles!

37
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,627
It's 7 a.m., september 1,

38
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:50,862
and a cloudy 68 degrees.

39
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:53,632
And here's the new one
from rain on fire...

40
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,636
called <i>here we are.</i> Yeah.

41
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:01,139
What?!

42
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,475
Amanda, it's dan.

43
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:04,643
Willie has
disappeared again.

44
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:06,478
I'm damn sure he's not
on his way to school.

45
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:08,647
I found all of his books
under his bed.

46
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:11,650
If he shows up, will you
please redirect him,

47
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:14,987
and try to stress the importance
of an education to him?

48
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,255
That brother of yours

49
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,991
won't make it out of the
eleventh grade at this rate.

50
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:23,895
Good morning!

51
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,666
I can't go back there.

52
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:30,002
I just left
that place...

53
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,504
oh, 6 hours ago.

54
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,108
Hey...

55
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:38,910
let's both
call in sick today.

56
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,013
Come on.
We can go sailing,

57
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,348
and we can do it
all day long.

58
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:44,950
Please.

59
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,385
You know i can't,
and neither can you.

60
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,719
Why?

61
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,988
Because mario
starts the mural today.

62
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:52,524
It's a big day.
He needs me.

63
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,693
I need you, too.

64
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:56,595
Come on back to bed.

65
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:58,397
Taylor, get up.

66
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,698
I refuse to move

67
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:02,200
until you come back here
and kiss me now.

68
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,375
Oh!

69
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:12,210
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

70
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,212
Mmm.

71
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:21,653
Morning.
Mm.

72
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:23,455
Morning.

73
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,560
Who the fuck finished off
my captain crunch?

74
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,829
Amanda, please.

75
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,898
Hey, baby,
what's for breakfast?

76
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,900
Oh! Willie!
Nice going.

77
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,069
Good morning.

78
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,570
Hey, banks.
Morning.

79
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,072
I've got a big
audition today.

80
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,106
Oh, hey.

81
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,909
You may be looking at
the future...

82
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,744
mr. Cat chow.

83
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:47,646
Right on, brother.

84
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:49,214
Everybody owes me
rent money.

85
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:50,782
The shower's
fucked up again.

86
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,351
Then somebody has to
call the landlord.

87
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:53,452
Not it.
Not it.

88
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,586
Not it.
Not it.

89
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:57,622
Has anybody seen
my white silk shirt?

90
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,624
Now what?

91
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,360
Ah, henry!

92
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:02,861
Um, i'm late.

93
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,797
I--i'll call you.

94
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,099
So, you guys,

95
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,600
what time is this
birthday dinner tonight?

96
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:09,668
About 8:30.

97
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:10,936
Sounds a little early
for m.j.

98
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,037
bye.
See ya.

99
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:14,106
Oh, amanda, you're gonna
make the cake, right?

100
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,108
One of your special
4-layers

101
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:19,177
with pretty roses
and stuff?

102
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,546
Taylor, toast.

103
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,448
Don't get on me tonight.

104
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:26,685
Aw, it would mean a lot
to m.j. if you were there.

105
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,554
Oh...

106
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,289
i'll see what i can do.

107
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:32,958
Well, bye.

108
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,309
So who's the guy?

109
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,678
Just a guy.

110
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,983
Well, i hope
you're being careful.

111
00:06:58,051 --> 00:06:59,584
Yes. Thank you.

112
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,086
I'm using condoms.

113
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:03,422
I hate them,
but i'm using them.

114
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,224
I'll see you tonight,
<i>mother.</i>

115
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,660
See you tonight, dear.

116
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:11,730
And try not to be
too late.

117
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:26,678
You are going to school.

118
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:28,547
Forget school.

119
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,348
Look at it outside!

120
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:31,616
Come on,

121
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,852
let's go to the beach
and eat cheeseburgers.

122
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:35,587
Will, dad called
this morning, ok?

123
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:36,855
He's pissed.

124
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:38,457
Yeah, well, fuck him.

125
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:41,460
I mean, school's whack.
Really, minx.

126
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:44,529
You wouldn't believe what
they had us doing yesterday.

127
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:46,531
We spent
the entire health class

128
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,467
putting rubbers
on bananas.

129
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:49,901
It's totally bogus.

130
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,205
I mean, besides,
my band is kickin' ass.

131
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:56,308
I want to be famous
like my big sister.

132
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,877
Yeah, well,
i'm hardly famous.

133
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,612
Yet.

134
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:03,548
Yet.

135
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:04,783
Yet.

136
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,386
Hey, boss, it's me.

137
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:09,888
Yeah, i'm sorry i'm late.

138
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,156
I had a little
problem this morning

139
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:12,891
that i couldn't get rid of.
Uh-huh.

140
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,659
Yeah, i did hear about
that takeover bid.

141
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:17,062
What's the reaction
in the market?

142
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,730
Really?

143
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,398
Uh-huh.

144
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,834
Well, i spoke to
my infamous c.p.a. friend,

145
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,003
and i'm gonna see him
at 4:00 for drinks,

146
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:28,673
then i'm on to my stinky rich
gold and oil friends, yeah.

147
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:31,743
Yeah, i think they're ready
to close the deal.

148
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:33,512
Oh, and david?

149
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,081
I'm sorry, but this will
never happen again.

150
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,583
Ok? Right.

151
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:41,419
Right. Bye.

152
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:44,756
Now 30-year
treasuries are eight...

153
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,094
oh, shit.

154
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,295
Fuck.

155
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,271
Hey, you got
another hole in your ear.

156
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,039
Yeah,
stacey made me do it.

157
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:02,941
Stacey? Who's stacey?

158
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,442
My woman.

159
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,610
Wait a minute.

160
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,445
I thought jocelyn
was your girlfriend.

161
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:08,613
That ended weeks ago.

162
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:10,882
Hi, mr. Solomon.
Hiya!

163
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,817
What is this,
mr. Rogers' neighborhood?

164
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,121
Who the hell knows their
neighbors in los angeles?

165
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:17,956
Hey, can i come to
the birthday party tonight?

166
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:20,292
In the car.
You are late for school.

167
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,695
Please?

168
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,731
Oh, stuart,
this is all my fault,

169
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,634
but let's not get the insurance
company involved, ok?

170
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:32,137
I mean, they can be
such a hassle.

171
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,072
Let me level with you.

172
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,374
Today's my 25th birthday,

173
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:39,077
and if i don't get to work
in 5 minutes,

174
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,313
i'm gonna lose my job.

175
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,815
Ok, ok.
Calm down.

176
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,155
You look like
a smart man.

177
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,823
Yeah.
What do you do?

178
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:53,758
No, let me guess--
hollywood.

179
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:55,660
You make great movies.

180
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,495
No, actually,
real estate.

181
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,497
That was my second guess.

182
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,232
Commercial, definitely.

183
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,168
How'd you know?

184
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,003
Your style.

185
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:06,671
The armani suite.

186
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,940
A man who enjoys
the finer things in life.

187
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,176
You're good
at what you do.

188
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,577
And so am i.

189
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:15,013
And what is it
that you're so good at?

190
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:17,449
Making intelligent people
terrifyingly rich.

191
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,852
You know, we should
get together and talk business.

192
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:23,254
And then we can clear up
this matter about the car.

193
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,690
Eh, it's...

194
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,926
actually not that bad.

195
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:32,364
I know a mechanic
who owes me a favor.

196
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,366
Perfect.

197
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,202
Let me give you
my number.

198
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:44,442
My business cards
are being reprinted,

199
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:47,779
so i'll give you
my home number.

200
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:53,985
Call me, stuart.

201
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,389
Ok... linda.

202
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,392
Hey, linda.

203
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,894
Yes, stuart?

204
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,829
Happy birthday.

205
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:07,899
Thank you.

206
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,567
Jesus, hallelujah.

207
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:11,302
Oh, mario.

208
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,971
I thought
we'd use the whole wall,

209
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,240
and we'd have, like,
this vibrant blue color

210
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:16,741
and these huge eyes

211
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,543
that are just, like,
piercing down at you.

212
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:19,577
Mm-hmm.

213
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:20,645
And then, um,

214
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:22,247
it'd be kind of like
an abstract thing

215
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:23,915
with this aztec style.

216
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:25,750
You know, like,
with the little, um, shapes,

217
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,419
and then they make up
the whole picture.

218
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:28,687
And then, of course,

219
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,255
we'd sign my name
at the bottom,

220
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,924
like that, in big letters.

221
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,426
6-foot letters.

222
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:38,897
So typical of m.j.
to miss her own party.

223
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,199
You guys,
this is ridiculous.

224
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:42,767
Why don't we just
go home?

225
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,369
Oh, come on.

226
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,938
I'm sure she just got
caught up with work.

227
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:49,274
You know how she tries
to do everything at once.

228
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:50,942
Ooh, sounds
seamy to me.

229
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,111
I'm sure she's got
a perfectly fine reason

230
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,446
for not being here.

231
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:55,780
Now, can we just relax?

232
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,115
Probably some guy.

233
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,550
Named jose cuervo?

234
00:11:58,618 --> 00:11:59,951
Who's that?

235
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,287
Great idea!
Shots for everybody.

236
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,456
All right, then.
Yo, bartender!

237
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,625
Why didn't you
tell us earlier

238
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:08,893
it was your birthday?

239
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,962
Oh, because
it's no big deal.

240
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:13,631
You know, i should
probably be going.

241
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,033
Nonsense.

242
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:16,968
Aren't you guys exhausted?

243
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:19,471
What year were you born,
young lady?

244
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:22,807
My mother taught me
never to reveal my age.

245
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:26,644
Well, how does
1969 sound?

246
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:29,147
Close enough.

247
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:31,249
All right, one more.

248
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:32,817
I'll drink to that.

249
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:36,321
They kept me sitting there
for 3 1/2 hours

250
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:39,324
with these screaming felines
crawling all over my body

251
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,760
just to see
if i was a cat person.

252
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:44,162
I've got fleas and scratches
all over me.

253
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:45,663
I hate cats.

254
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,165
Hey, waiter?

255
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:48,767
Well, guys,
i just called the house,

256
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:50,668
and she's not there.

257
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:02,413
Ah, a sucker is born
every minute.

258
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:06,251
Wait till you see
mario's sketch for the mural.

259
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,353
It's so beautiful.

260
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:09,721
Really?

261
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,456
Oh, that's great.
That's really cool.

262
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,024
I can't wait
to see it.

263
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,692
Yeah, me, too.
That would be--

264
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:17,028
ok, ok, ok. Chill out.

265
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:19,697
Oh, this is
bullshit.

266
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,366
You know something?
You guys can sit here

267
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:22,967
and wait all night long
if you want to,

268
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,536
but i'm gonna go
play some pool.

269
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:25,870
Great idea, minx.

270
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,639
What exactly
is in cat chow?

271
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:29,874
I don't exactly know,

272
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,877
but it tastes mostly
like cardboard...

273
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:35,880
with this touch
of gross fish guts.

274
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,549
Mmm.

275
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:52,730
So the director says,

276
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,666
"i like what you do
with the acting,

277
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:56,935
but i don't feel the connection
between the cat."

278
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,303
I was like, no, i love cats.

279
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,538
I--i've had cats
all my life. I--

280
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:03,241
well,
look who showed up.

281
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,343
Hi, guys.

282
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:07,912
I'm really sorry.

283
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,414
By the time
i got to the restaurant,

284
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:10,849
you guys had already left.

285
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,050
She's bombed.

286
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,519
I totally lost track
of time.

287
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:15,653
You know, m.j.,

288
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,989
you're one lucky bitch
you got friends like us,

289
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:20,592
'cause nobody else would
put up with your shit.

290
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,861
I know.

291
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:25,597
I'm really sorry,
you guys.

292
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:27,932
But i brought ice cream--

293
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,568
toffee heath bar crunch,

294
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:33,171
new york super fudge chunk,

295
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,939
chocolate burnt almonds...

296
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,211
aw, come on, you guys.

297
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,947
I'm gonna
take everybody out big time

298
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:45,783
when i collect my commission
on these clients.

299
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,621
You should've seen the money
that was flying.

300
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:53,625
We had 3 $500 bottles
of champagne.

301
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,126
So?

302
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:56,794
We were
drinking longnecks

303
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,830
for, what,
2.50 a bottle?

304
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,031
Had to be,
at least.

305
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,232
Oh.

306
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:02,734
Anybody want anything?
I'm getting a beer.

307
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:03,735
No, i'm fine.

308
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:05,136
I'll have a beer.

309
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:06,971
Yeah, me, too.

310
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,139
Listen, willie.

311
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,807
16-year-olds who
drink too much to be cool

312
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:13,378
end up on the bathroom floor
throwing up.

313
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,979
She speaks
from experience.

314
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,314
No way, minx.

315
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:17,815
I'm not drunk.

316
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,250
I am not.

317
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:20,818
I'm just happy.

318
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:22,487
I mean it.

319
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,823
Happy birthday.

320
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:28,226
Oh, thanks, banks.

321
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,331
I'll get it.

322
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,332
Not here.

323
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:35,333
I am not here.

324
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:36,668
Not here.

325
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,002
Hello?

326
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,504
Yeah, hi, this is henry.

327
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:40,672
Is m.j. there?

328
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,273
Oh, hang on a minute.

329
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:44,342
M.j., it's henry.

330
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:46,411
I'm not here.

331
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,448
Oh, silly me!

332
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:52,617
M.j.'s still out.

333
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:55,253
Yeah, all right,
i'll have--

334
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:57,355
i've called
2 times before--

335
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:58,690
fine. Bye.

336
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:00,425
Well, make sure--

337
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,695
that's the third time
he's called today.

338
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,163
Tell me about it.

339
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,698
Fuck 'em once,

340
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:09,567
they want to put a goddamn
leash around your neck.

341
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,370
Did you by chance grow up
in a truck stop, amanda?

342
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,839
Banks,
why are you a fag?

343
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:16,207
Willie!

344
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:18,009
<i>Why?</i>

345
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:19,978
Uh...

346
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:23,281
it's a long
and complicated story

347
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,216
that i--

348
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,220
oh, brother.

349
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,223
Anybody want to help me

350
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,858
put this little
nightmare to bed?

351
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:35,893
Let's take him out back
and shoot him first.

352
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:37,362
Little shit.

353
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,064
I'm gonna go to bed, too.
You coming?

354
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,233
Uh, in a minute.

355
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:44,369
Ready?

356
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:52,076
Happy birthday, m.j.

357
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:55,813
really just a pleasure
spending the evening with you.

358
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:58,750
Ok.

359
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:02,253
♪ Oh, we have
something for you ♪

360
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,588
oh!

361
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,423
Happy birthday.

362
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,693
Oh, god.

363
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:11,662
It's really
from everyone, so...

364
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,268
oh, my god.

365
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:19,837
Oh, frankie,
this is so beautiful.

366
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:21,839
It's from indonesia.

367
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,274
Watch his head.

368
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:26,944
Yeah, i like this.

369
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:30,381
Frankie...

370
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,383
i'm sorry about tonight.

371
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,786
It's ok. I understand.

372
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:37,021
Happy birthday, girlfriend.

373
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,527
I love you, frankie.

374
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:48,900
Mmm.

375
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,536
Well, i'm going to bed.

376
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,307
Hey, m.j., um...

377
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:57,942
i thought henry
was kinda cute.

378
00:17:58,011 --> 00:18:00,812
Why didn't you
want to talk to him?

379
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,582
Because there are
200,000 henrys in l.a.,

380
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:07,151
and i just
haven't found one

381
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,821
that i want to spend
the rest of my life with.

382
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,089
Hmm.

383
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:14,158
Well, don't give up.

384
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:17,028
It happened to me.

385
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,663
All right,
well, good night.

386
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,498
Good night, frankie.

387
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,168
Taylor.

388
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:42,887
You know when i realized
i was turning into an adult?

389
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,056
I was driving
really fast one day,

390
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:50,928
and i could visualize
being in a car accident--

391
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:53,097
the crunching metal,

392
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:56,234
being pinned against
the steering wheel.

393
00:18:56,302 --> 00:19:00,571
Maybe that was just
a message to slow down?

394
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,507
You know, like
cracking the mercedes.

395
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:03,708
Oh, please.

396
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,611
I got out of that one,
no problem.

397
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,980
Besides, you've gotta move
really quick

398
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:11,182
to get what you need
in this lifetime.

399
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:13,251
Even if that means
hurting people?

400
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,619
Come on, banks.

401
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,255
You both want it
just as badly as i do.

402
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,224
Miss metropolitan museum,

403
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:22,994
and you, the aspiring actor.

404
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:25,830
Yeah, well, at least
we're not self destructive.

405
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:27,498
I mean, come on, m.j.,

406
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:29,033
where's your sense
of self worth?

407
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:31,035
I mean, you are always
taking advantage of people

408
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:32,303
and you know it.

409
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:37,275
I really don't need
a lecture on morals.

410
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,676
You know,
sometimes i wonder

411
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,244
if you even have any.

412
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:13,211
Want to try it on?

413
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:16,847
I didn't hear you come in.

414
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,324
It's gettin' too crazy.

415
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,326
What are you talking about?

416
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:32,263
Things are becoming
serious with frankie.

417
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:35,366
Oh, i'm so happy for you.

418
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:38,603
I just have
one question, though.

419
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:42,106
Why are you still
sleeping with me?

420
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:44,508
It can't happen anymore.

421
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,611
I just wanted
to tell you that.

422
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:01,492
So these women really
put on gorilla masks

423
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,394
and protest sexism
in the arts?

424
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,563
Yeah.

425
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:07,398
Somehow i can see you

426
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:08,532
slinking through
the streets

427
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,701
in a fake black fur.

428
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,270
Yeah, well,

429
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:14,305
at least they're making
a statement

430
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:17,141
about the white male domination
in the art world.

431
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,143
I mean, you walk into
any art gallery

432
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:21,879
and you look at the ratio...
i mean, it's pitiful!

433
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,881
It's the same
white male artists

434
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,150
over and over
and over again.

435
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:28,986
You know, i swear,
i am going to start

436
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:30,254
the l.a. chapter
of the guerilla girls.

437
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:32,223
Watch me, i will.

438
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,758
I know.

439
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:35,493
It's like every time
i turn on the tv,

440
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:37,094
it's the same faces

441
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:39,697
getting the same
bad tv roles.

442
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:41,198
You know, sometimes
i really wonder

443
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:42,767
what the hell i'm doing.

444
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:44,468
Like today,
i have this audition.

445
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:46,270
The casting director's
all smiles,

446
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:47,271
"that was
a perfect delivery,

447
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,439
banks, that was
wonderful!"

448
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:49,707
And then
she shuffles me out

449
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:51,375
and shuffles in
6 other guys

450
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:53,844
who look just like me.

451
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:56,113
I just feel like
i'm wasting my time.

452
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:57,648
No, you are not.

453
00:21:57,717 --> 00:22:00,017
Hey, you've got
2 national commercials.

454
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:01,619
I mean, that is great.

455
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:03,487
Any horse's ass
can drink a soft drink

456
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:04,889
and sell ketchup.

457
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,457
Nuh-uh.

458
00:22:06,526 --> 00:22:09,460
I'm thinking of getting
back into the theater.

459
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:10,761
Yeah?

460
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,797
Back east somewhere.

461
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,666
My agent
keeps telling me

462
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:17,635
that a movie
will happen soon,

463
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,904
but yada, yada, yada.

464
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:24,275
It's like i keep waiting
for something out there

465
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:30,581
to make me feel whole
and complete, but...

466
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,250
but maybe
that's my problem.

467
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,454
Come on, banks.

468
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,923
Ok, you--
you have to have

469
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:41,058
those dreams,
you know?

470
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:43,060
And those
goals, too.

471
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:44,562
I don't know.

472
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,131
I think the future's
overrated, anyway.

473
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,734
I mean, whatever happened
to living in the present?

474
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:52,603
You know, being happy
day by day.

475
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,338
How often do you
find yourself thinking

476
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:56,140
"as soon as i get
that job,

477
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:59,009
"or meet that person
or sell that painting,

478
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:01,078
then i'm gonna be happy."

479
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:02,747
You know, i think
there's something

480
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:04,782
inherently wrong
with that way of thinking.

481
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:07,284
I think we constantly
set ourselves up

482
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:08,552
for dissatisfaction. I--

483
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:10,154
hey, hey.

484
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:12,523
I'm sorry.

485
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:15,059
I'm just in
a piss of a mood.

486
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:17,094
I had a lousy audition,

487
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:18,896
i don't have enough money
for rent.

488
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:20,131
Hey, listen,

489
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:21,332
you know i sold
a painting last week

490
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:22,800
so it's no problem
if you need the money.

491
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:24,135
Ok?

492
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:25,803
Thanks.
You're welcome.

493
00:23:25,872 --> 00:23:27,371
Thanks.

494
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:30,808
I might have
to take you up on that.

495
00:23:30,877 --> 00:23:32,443
We'll do it.

496
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:37,581
I really like that one.

497
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,150
I think it's gonna be great.

498
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:40,851
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

499
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,287
Well, maybe someday

500
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:45,956
it'll hang in the museum
of contemporary art.

501
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:48,292
You hang onto
those dreams, girlfriend.

502
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:51,395
That's why we stay
in this smog-infested city.

503
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:53,030
Come on, i gotta change
for an appointment,

504
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,832
and then i'm gonna
buy you some breakfast.

505
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:56,000
Come on, joey,
hurry up, man!

506
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:57,234
Hey, frankie?

507
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:58,602
Yeah?

508
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:01,038
Did you hear about
george's brother?

509
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:02,807
No.

510
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,775
E.s.g. got him.

511
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:06,444
His first night
out of jail,

512
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:08,012
they shot him.

513
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,649
Oh, my god.

514
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,551
You're staying out of it,
aren't you?

515
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,019
Mario?

516
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,754
Yeah, yeah.

517
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:18,556
I'm not stupid.

518
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:21,292
Give it to me,
give it to me!

519
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,594
Give it back! Come on!

520
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:25,729
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

521
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,299
Hey! Hey! All right,
you, sit down.

522
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:29,700
You, sit down.

523
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:31,902
Now you just sit here
until you're ready

524
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,270
to behave, ok?

525
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:35,206
I got plenty of other kids
that want to paint.

526
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:38,442
I'm really sick of you
picking on people, george!

527
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:40,344
Why don't you mind
your own business?

528
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:43,414
Because it is my business.

529
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:48,252
You could have called
to tell me this,

530
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:51,822
but you didn't.
You came here.

531
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:54,291
I know why you're here,
and so do you.

532
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,860
M.j., it's
over with now.

533
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:57,127
I just wanted
to see you

534
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:58,596
face to face
and be done with it.

535
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:02,099
Now, taylor, wouldn't you miss
our little rendezvous'?

536
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,300
Stop it.

537
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:04,702
I know you want me.

538
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,470
How can you go on
doing this?

539
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:07,671
You know, i thought
she was your friend.

540
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,307
Same way you can.

541
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:11,909
I know how
you feel about me.

542
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:13,410
I can see it
in your eyes.

543
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:16,180
I don't feel
that way anymore.

544
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:20,551
Touch me, taylor.

545
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,120
I want you
to touch me.

546
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:28,959
Touch me.

547
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:33,197
Please?

548
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:39,136
Taylor, your heart's
beating fast.

549
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:41,438
So is mine.

550
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:43,774
So fast.

551
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:04,695
Don't stop, don't stop,
don't stop, don't stop,

552
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:06,230
don't stop.

553
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,806
Well, you see, in this
painting here,

554
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,775
she's holding his head
out of the window

555
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:21,011
because she's deciding
whether or not to keep him,

556
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,113
and the monkey
around her neck

557
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:24,615
symbolizes the relationship

558
00:26:24,684 --> 00:26:26,483
which--which doesn't
go beyond the physical.

559
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:28,986
Hmm. That's,
uh, interesting.

560
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:31,455
What size is that?

561
00:26:31,524 --> 00:26:33,557
Uh, this one's 6 by 8.

562
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:35,025
Do you have
anything smaller?

563
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,961
No.

564
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,129
Yeah, to be honest.

565
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:42,032
I'm not sure i have any
openings for some time,

566
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,868
but, uh,
maybe over dinner

567
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,403
you could
convince me

568
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:48,539
to rearrange
my schedule.

569
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,574
What do you say?

570
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:52,142
Um...

571
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,612
thanks...

572
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,214
but no thanks.

573
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:11,528
Oh! Oh, god, what if
somebody comes home?

574
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,700
Nobody's coming home
for hours.

575
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:24,375
Hello!

576
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:25,743
Is anybody home?

577
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,578
Oh, shit, somebody's here!

578
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:30,581
Grab my jacket,
get my jacket!

579
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:51,935
Ahh.

580
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:00,978
Mm-mmm.

581
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:02,813
Nectar.

582
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:04,114
Hey, will.
Hey.

583
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,016
Are you coming
to my boss' party today?

584
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:07,584
Absolutely.

585
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:08,952
Where is it?
Malibu.

586
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,821
Free beer?

587
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,922
All you can drink.

588
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:13,924
I suppose i can
check it out.

589
00:28:33,646 --> 00:28:34,645
Amanda, on answering machine:
speak!

590
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:35,946
The car
has been stolen.

591
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:37,181
Before i call the police,
i thought your brother

592
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:38,615
might have an idea about--

593
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:39,883
hi, dad. Hi, dad.

594
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:41,318
Yeah, amanda,
willie wouldn't be there

595
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:42,352
by any chance,
would he?

596
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:43,520
Yeah, yeah,
he's here.

597
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:46,023
Did you know he's supposed
to be grounded?

598
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:47,458
No, no, that was
my fault.

599
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:48,692
I asked him
to come over

600
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:49,993
and help me
hang some stuff.

601
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,395
Well, it would have been nice
if he'd let me know he was--

602
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:52,863
no, no, no,
you're right.

603
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:54,064
He should have
left a note.

604
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:55,432
All right, well, make sure
he doesn't drink anything.

605
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:57,234
No, i promise.

606
00:28:57,303 --> 00:28:58,302
And be sure he gets home ok,

607
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,536
would you?
Ok.

608
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:00,537
All right, bye, honey.

609
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:01,538
Speak to you soon.

610
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:02,773
Ok. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

611
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:04,808
You're busted!

612
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:07,978
Will, you gotta stop
stealing dad's car!

613
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:11,048
Come on, i can't face
all those gonads on the bus!

614
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:13,183
And besides, the car's
just sitting there.

615
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,886
He's never around anyway.

616
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:17,955
What's with all the beer?

617
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:20,657
Oh, god.

618
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:22,459
Thanks for
covering for me.

619
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:23,694
Yeah.

620
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:25,462
Yeah.

621
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,466
So, uh, what time's
that party today?

622
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:30,834
You are not going
to the party.

623
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:32,202
You are going home.

624
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,370
But m.j. invited me!

625
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,738
No!

626
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:36,740
Besides, you owe banks
an apology,

627
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:39,576
and until he gets one,
this house is off-limits, ok?

628
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:41,011
Banks?
I meant it!

629
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,680
Anybody home?

630
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,249
Oh. Hi, guys.

631
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:46,917
Banks, dude, look.
I'm sorry about asking

632
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:48,552
why you're a butt pirate.

633
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:50,254
Oh, my god. Willie!

634
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:52,489
Ok, no hard feelings,
all right, man?

635
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,893
What?!

636
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:02,232
What?

637
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,134
M.j.

638
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:07,004
m.j., your boss has
a nice little beach house.

639
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:09,206
This is just for weekends.

640
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:10,808
It's the biggest place
in town.

641
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:12,409
Oh, my god.

642
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:13,443
Divine.
Wow.

643
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:22,586
Nervous, frankie?

644
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:23,720
Mm-hmm.

645
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:25,756
All right, let's go.

646
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:27,090
Thank you.

647
00:30:30,563 --> 00:30:32,996
Hey. Thanks.

648
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:40,938
Oh, my god.
David!

649
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,907
I'm going to the bar.

650
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:55,619
Excuse me.

651
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,421
Oh, champagne.

652
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:03,961
Cheers.

653
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:09,066
M.j., it's about time.

654
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:10,901
And of course
you know julia.

655
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:11,902
Julia.

656
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:13,036
Nice to see you, m.j.

657
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:15,639
you look so--so skinny.

658
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,574
The house is great.
Everything looks--

659
00:31:17,643 --> 00:31:18,942
it's nice of you
to say so.

660
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:20,878
Would you excuse me
for a minute?

661
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:23,046
I need to have a word
with the caterer.

662
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:24,381
All right.

663
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,616
Bye--bye, honey.

664
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:27,484
Oof, your wife hates me.

665
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:28,852
Well, of course.

666
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:30,053
But for all
the right reasons.

667
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:32,522
I'd take it
as a compliment.

668
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:55,712
It's good
to see you again.

669
00:31:57,316 --> 00:31:58,715
Sorry, but...

670
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:00,884
i don't know you.

671
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,788
Yes, you do.

672
00:32:04,857 --> 00:32:07,257
But you might not
remember.

673
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:09,927
It wasn't
in this lifetime.

674
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:12,529
But i'm sure it's you.

675
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:16,500
Apparently,
you're mistaking me

676
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:20,470
for somebody who just might
buy into this shit.

677
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:21,905
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

678
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:23,974
I want to talk to you.

679
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:27,010
Every thought,
every feeling,

680
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:30,514
every action of my life,
my pasts...

681
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:33,617
has led me to this moment.

682
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:36,219
You are the other half.

683
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,927
Spare me, ok?

684
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:45,162
The more you know,

685
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:48,632
the less you'll understand.

686
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:52,102
Alexander.

687
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:54,237
Alexander midnight.

688
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:57,140
When did you
make that one up?

689
00:32:57,209 --> 00:33:01,445
I come from a long lineage
of midnights.

690
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:02,980
Let me guess.

691
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:04,581
When you're not,
um, you know,

692
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,183
passing out
the cocktails,

693
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:07,951
i bet...

694
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,220
that you are an actor.

695
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:13,156
And if i said yes,
what does that mean?

696
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:15,258
Do you so easily
define people

697
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:18,095
by their--
by their occupations?

698
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:20,897
Don't we measure
a person's strength

699
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:23,266
on what we call
"distinction"?

700
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:26,536
True individuality?

701
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:29,039
Everyone wants
to make their mark,

702
00:33:29,108 --> 00:33:30,507
but the buddhists say,

703
00:33:30,576 --> 00:33:34,778
"that is only the pursuit
of a phantom."

704
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:38,682
You're not one of those

705
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:40,317
chanting buddhists,
are you?

706
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:42,185
But this--this identity,
this label,

707
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:43,653
it's merely a thought,

708
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:45,989
it's a picture
of who we are,

709
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:48,925
what we can be.

710
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:52,062
It's an illusion.

711
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,167
Do you want
to take a walk?

712
00:33:57,236 --> 00:34:00,871
Well, i thought you were
working this party.

713
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:07,811
Not anymore.

714
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:13,483
Whoa! Windy!

715
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:14,951
Heh. How are you?

716
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,253
Fine.

717
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:17,754
Vic. Vic montana.

718
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:19,556
Hello.

719
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:23,026
Pleasure's all yours.

720
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:26,363
Excuse me, i have to...
get a--my--

721
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,798
excuse me.

722
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:29,666
You know, you remind me
of someone.

723
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:32,669
So, is there anything
you want to confess?

724
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,805
You seem like
the type of person

725
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:36,406
who has a lot of secrets.

726
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:39,242
Why would i tell you?

727
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:41,945
Because you like me.

728
00:34:42,014 --> 00:34:43,046
No, i don't.

729
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:44,247
Yes, you do.

730
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:46,083
No, i don't.
Yes, you do.

731
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:47,617
I do not!

732
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:50,087
You're lying!

733
00:34:50,155 --> 00:34:51,288
How can you tell?

734
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:52,956
'Cause your nostrils
are flaring.

735
00:34:53,025 --> 00:34:54,124
No, they're not.

736
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:56,259
Yes, they are.
They're not!

737
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:57,861
They are.

738
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:00,263
They're not.

739
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:02,499
You're very cute.

740
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:03,867
Hey!

741
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:05,469
Hi, honey.
Hello.

742
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:07,070
I just met the fruit
of the loom grape.

743
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:09,639
He's actually a hell
of a nice guy.

744
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:11,908
Hey...

745
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:13,710
that guy,

746
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,479
he's really cute.

747
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:17,280
Very cute.

748
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:18,815
You're not shopping.

749
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:20,717
Oh, yeah.

750
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,152
Where is taylor anyway?

751
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:24,654
I don't know.

752
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:26,623
Probably working.

753
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,726
Everything ok
with you guys?

754
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,428
Yeah.

755
00:35:31,497 --> 00:35:34,030
You know what, banks?

756
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:37,400
I think i'm gonna
marry him.

757
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:40,270
Really?

758
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:42,239
Someday.

759
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,307
Well, i'm happy for ya.

760
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:46,710
Thank you.
That's great.

761
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:52,549
So why are you so quiet
all the time?

762
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:55,185
Why do you ask so many
questions all the time?

763
00:35:55,254 --> 00:35:58,455
I want to know
everything about you.

764
00:35:58,524 --> 00:36:01,091
Well, maybe i'm resting
my brain.

765
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,193
You have this
goddess thing

766
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:04,427
about you,
you know that?

767
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,596
Really?

768
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,633
You remind me
of aphrodite.

769
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:11,801
Well, maybe
i should have been

770
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,104
a statue
in somebody's garden.

771
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,510
What are you
so angry about?

772
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:27,083
I admire you social workers
for doing something

773
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:30,687
so selfless in this town
full of egomaniacs.

774
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:32,822
And i'm no exception.

775
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:35,492
Banks, yes, you are.

776
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,430
Listen, honey, you're wasting
your time with tinkerbelle here.

777
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:42,365
Call me.

778
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:45,535
Hey, loved your shampoo spot.
It worked.

779
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:47,404
Yeah.

780
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:50,807
Don't ask.

781
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,109
Having fun
at your party?

782
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:54,377
No. You?

783
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:55,779
I love your parties.

784
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:57,881
Yeah, well,
you have to say that.

785
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,616
You work for me.
No.

786
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:01,251
I mean, look at all these
dreadful people

787
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,654
i'm forced to entertain,
pretending to like each other.

788
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,557
At least in new york,
people hate each other openly.

789
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:11,127
Although, there is one person
i'd like you to meet, mm-hmm.

790
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:14,764
Over there, see him?
Paul knowles.

791
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:19,402
Major venture capitalist,
recently divorced.

792
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:30,013
Aphrodite.

793
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,084
You want to take a dip?

794
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:36,920
What, you think i'm gonna
get in this thing with you?

795
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:38,722
Why not?

796
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,024
Well, what if somebody
comes in?

797
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:43,059
I mean, i usually
don't make a habit

798
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:44,594
of getting into hot tubs
with people

799
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:45,762
i just met at a party.

800
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:47,130
But we didn't
just meet.

801
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,765
Ok, the other life,
i completely forgot,

802
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:50,133
i'm sorry.

803
00:37:50,202 --> 00:37:51,534
Hey, it's just a tub.

804
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,037
Plus, look what i found.

805
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:56,006
♪ Bum bum bum ♪

806
00:37:58,277 --> 00:37:59,909
ok, ok, but, um...

807
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:01,778
just leave your underwear on.

808
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:04,080
Oh. I wouldn't have it
any other way.

809
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:06,049
Here, you can wear
my t-shirt.

810
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:08,918
I'll just, uh,
i'll wait under here...

811
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:12,822
until you've
changed.

812
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:14,291
All right.

813
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:15,992
Ahh.

814
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:22,165
Ahh.

815
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:25,602
Hey, come on,
hurry up, all right?

816
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:27,103
And don't look.

817
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:38,515
Actually,
i just got back

818
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:40,050
from spending a month
in kenya.

819
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:41,318
Ooh. How wonderful.

820
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:43,019
Yeah, it was.

821
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:44,421
People there say

822
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,090
it's the soul
of the universe.

823
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,559
I think so.

824
00:38:49,628 --> 00:38:53,363
Good place to get away,
clear your mind.

825
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:55,098
Ah.

826
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,702
But enough
about that stuff.

827
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,171
David tells me
you're the new fireball

828
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:03,139
down at the brokerage.

829
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:06,076
I love my job.

830
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:07,777
Maybe we should
get together and, uh--

831
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,079
talk money?

832
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:12,982
Well, i had thought about
a little dinner first.

833
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:15,018
That would be great.
Let me give you my card.

834
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:16,186
Great.

835
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:17,654
My home number's on it.

836
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:19,322
Call me.

837
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:21,324
Perfect.
Thanks.

838
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:25,762
My brother and i used
to pretend we were in <i>seahunt</i>

839
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:27,564
and stay under water
for 45 minutes

840
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:29,165
and really
freak our mother out.

841
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:30,333
How amusing.

842
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:33,236
Stop it.

843
00:39:33,305 --> 00:39:34,704
Hey, how come
you're so worried

844
00:39:34,773 --> 00:39:36,706
about being miss perfect
all the time, huh?

845
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:38,308
Stop it!

846
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:39,743
Don't you realize

847
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:41,911
that is it precisely
our imperfections

848
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,981
that makes each human
individually loveable?

849
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,816
Do you ever
take some time

850
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,218
and actually listen

851
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:49,486
to the shit
that you say?

852
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,087
Do you?

853
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:54,991
I am a firm believer
in love at first sight.

854
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,894
And few people are fortunate
enough to experience it.

855
00:39:57,963 --> 00:40:00,864
So why are you
telling me this?

856
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:04,901
When i saw you earlier,

857
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,003
i knew that we had
been together before.

858
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:10,340
That's what love
at first sight is.

859
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:15,211
It's a reconnection
of 2 old, intertwined souls.

860
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,316
It's snowing.

861
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,487
Hey man, thanks a lot
for the party.

862
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:25,755
Oh, yes.

863
00:40:25,824 --> 00:40:27,290
We'll really have to
have you over next time.

864
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,793
Thank you very much.
Thank you, betty.

865
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:31,060
Hey, wait a second!

866
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:33,263
Wasn't that guy
working for us?

867
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,301
I know,
i should have called.

868
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,569
Are you mad?

869
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:41,271
No, i was
just worried

870
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:42,572
when you never
showed up.

871
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:44,040
I know, i'm sorry.

872
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:46,209
But i...

873
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:49,078
i'm just not in the mood
to be at a party tonight.

874
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:52,048
Taylor, what's
going on?

875
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:01,257
I woke up this morning
wondering...

876
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:05,328
how much of my life
am i going to spend

877
00:41:05,397 --> 00:41:07,430
working on cases that...

878
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:09,866
i don't care about?

879
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:14,237
So i quit.

880
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:17,907
Do you think i'm crazy?

881
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:21,177
No.

882
00:41:21,246 --> 00:41:24,080
I mean...

883
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,549
i don't know
what i'm gonna do,

884
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:29,886
but somehow that just
doesn't seem...

885
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:32,822
very important right now.

886
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,757
Boy, i knew
you were unhappy.

887
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,059
I had no idea
it was this extreme.

888
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:37,560
Yeah.

889
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:38,862
Well, i kinda wish

890
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,196
you had talked to me
about it.

891
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:42,465
Well, uh--

892
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:48,304
it's just something
i needed to work out alone.

893
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:51,741
But why don't you
let me help you?

894
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,512
I love you, taylor.

895
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,047
I just want us
to be happy.

896
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:03,987
Pphttt.

897
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:19,903
I gotta go to bed,
you guys.

898
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:21,037
Yeah.

899
00:42:21,106 --> 00:42:22,272
I'm sorry.
I'm tired.

900
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,473
I'll see you tomorrow.

901
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:24,541
Ok, honey.
It was fun.

902
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:26,175
Good night.
Bye.

903
00:42:26,244 --> 00:42:27,710
Mmm.

904
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:30,280
I think i'm gonna
turn in, too.

905
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:31,948
Amanda?
Yeah?

906
00:42:32,017 --> 00:42:34,384
Who was that guy
that you disappeared with?

907
00:42:34,452 --> 00:42:38,154
Oh, he's just
another lunatic

908
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:40,056
who's convinced
we were lovers

909
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:42,458
in a past life.
Oh, dear.

910
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:44,027
It's very
frightening.

911
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,563
Good night, honey.

912
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:48,431
Good night.

913
00:43:07,786 --> 00:43:09,385
Henry, on answering machine:
hi, this is henry's machine.

914
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:10,620
I'm not home right now--

915
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:13,122
hello, i'm here!
Don't hang up! Hello!

916
00:43:29,374 --> 00:43:31,841
Like, one minute
you can't stand the guy,

917
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,142
and then you're
picking up the phone

918
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:34,477
and you're calling him.

919
00:43:34,546 --> 00:43:36,045
Oh, you're one to talk.

920
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,181
Hopping into hot tubs
with total strangers.

921
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:40,183
M.j., nothing happened.

922
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:42,585
Of course, i understand
why that's so difficult

923
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:43,987
for you to believe,

924
00:43:44,055 --> 00:43:45,755
because you probably
would have fucked him.

925
00:43:45,824 --> 00:43:48,358
Just because
some of us enjoy sex

926
00:43:48,426 --> 00:43:50,860
doesn't imply
that i'm a slut.

927
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:53,229
Henry wasn't
your type anyway.

928
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:54,631
Neither were
half the other guys

929
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:56,799
i've ever dated.

930
00:43:56,868 --> 00:44:00,370
Do you guys know that
i lost my virginity

931
00:44:00,438 --> 00:44:03,072
to a kleptomaniac?

932
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,675
His name was bobby rose.

933
00:44:05,744 --> 00:44:08,778
Seriously, after he took
my virginity,

934
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:12,115
he stole my father's watch.
A total klepto.

935
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:16,252
Well, at least
you remember his name.

936
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:20,189
I lost my virginity
to doris becker,

937
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:23,092
and i've never been
the same since.

938
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,994
Boris becker?

939
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:29,399
Boris becker, my god!

940
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:33,169
So, uh, banks,

941
00:44:33,238 --> 00:44:35,838
have you ever thought
that, i don't know,

942
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:37,006
maybe you just
haven't been

943
00:44:37,075 --> 00:44:38,441
with the right
woman yet?

944
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:40,943
Well, that's definitely
not the issue here,

945
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,179
but thank you
for the offer.

946
00:44:43,248 --> 00:44:45,248
Oh, you're welcome.

947
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:46,883
Look, i haven't lost
my virginity yet,

948
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:48,351
but i'll be sure
to share it with you all

949
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,421
in great detail when i do.

950
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:53,756
Oh, jeez, isn't anybody
tired in this house?

951
00:44:53,825 --> 00:44:57,393
It's 4 a.m.!

952
00:44:57,462 --> 00:44:59,595
You know what's
the really weird thing?

953
00:44:59,664 --> 00:45:02,031
Is that the only thing
i can remember

954
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,767
is that it was in
my parents' house

955
00:45:04,836 --> 00:45:07,003
behind the couch.

956
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:10,139
It's so scary how our brains
let us remember

957
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,875
only isolated memories.

958
00:45:12,944 --> 00:45:14,377
I think it's all
still in there,

959
00:45:14,446 --> 00:45:16,279
but as we get older,

960
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:17,447
our brain, you know,
sorts through

961
00:45:17,515 --> 00:45:19,148
all those ideas
and memories

962
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:20,450
and feelings
and philosophies.

963
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:21,984
And it's like
it's all compacting

964
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:23,686
and compressing down.

965
00:45:23,755 --> 00:45:24,987
But you know, like,
a diamond is formed?

966
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,390
Ok, so we're forming
a diamond in our minds

967
00:45:27,459 --> 00:45:29,859
of who are we are
and what we need to know.

968
00:45:29,928 --> 00:45:31,961
Sometimes i think
it's best just to forget

969
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,063
certain things that have
happened to us.

970
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,503
So, where
are we going tonight?

971
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:42,672
He's making me dinner.

972
00:45:42,741 --> 00:45:45,208
Oh, how nineties.

973
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:47,744
Oh, honey,
you can't wear that.

974
00:45:47,812 --> 00:45:50,079
So, what--who's
making you dinner?

975
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:52,849
The man i met
at david's house.

976
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:55,051
The older one?

977
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,186
Uh-huh.

978
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:59,388
Oh!

979
00:45:59,457 --> 00:46:01,023
Ugh, i do look fat.

980
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,192
Oh!

981
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:04,460
Yeah, you--
she's really fat.

982
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:05,962
She's huge.

983
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,964
At least 10 pounds overweight
on the hips.

984
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:12,368
I haven't seen much
of you or taylor lately.

985
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:16,806
Taylor quit his job,
you guys.

986
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:20,076
Really?

987
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:21,210
Wow.

988
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,446
He didn't want me
to say anything.

989
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:27,150
Been in a really
weird mood lately.

990
00:46:27,218 --> 00:46:28,518
What an idiot.

991
00:46:28,586 --> 00:46:29,819
He was making
so much money.

992
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:30,753
So what is he
gonna do now?

993
00:46:30,822 --> 00:46:32,855
I don't know.

994
00:46:32,924 --> 00:46:37,226
Tonight's our
one year anniversary.

995
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:42,899
Oh, god,

996
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,200
i hope he remembers.

997
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:45,635
Doubtful.

998
00:46:45,703 --> 00:46:47,970
I'm just kidding!

999
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:51,908
Amanda, mr. Midnight's
been calling

1000
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,709
an awful lot lately.

1001
00:46:53,778 --> 00:46:55,945
Not interested.

1002
00:46:56,014 --> 00:46:58,080
I mean, as friends.
You know, he's helping me

1003
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,448
put together
a show and stuff.

1004
00:46:59,517 --> 00:47:01,184
I think
he's good looking

1005
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:03,219
and i think you guys
make a fabulous couple.

1006
00:47:03,288 --> 00:47:04,487
Listen, you can't
wear underwear with that.

1007
00:47:04,556 --> 00:47:05,555
You have major v.p.l.

1008
00:47:05,623 --> 00:47:07,790
then i'm not gonna go.

1009
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:10,493
Christ, will you just
put anything on?!

1010
00:47:10,562 --> 00:47:12,094
You'll take it off,
anyway.

1011
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:14,363
It's different
with paul.

1012
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:16,566
He's older,
sophisticated.

1013
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:18,634
Besides, he's
a potential client,

1014
00:47:18,703 --> 00:47:21,037
and i have never
slept with a client.

1015
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:22,839
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1016
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:26,275
The opera man!

1017
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:56,272
Taylor...

1018
00:47:56,341 --> 00:47:58,474
i'm really glad
you remembered.

1019
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:01,711
I thought for sure
you'd forget.

1020
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,117
You don't know what
i'm talking about.

1021
00:48:08,186 --> 00:48:09,719
Of course i do.

1022
00:48:11,756 --> 00:48:13,990
What, then?

1023
00:48:20,265 --> 00:48:22,598
Jesus, taylor.

1024
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:32,808
Hi.
- Hi.

1025
00:48:32,877 --> 00:48:35,011
Wow, you look great.

1026
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,145
Thanks.

1027
00:48:36,214 --> 00:48:37,513
Come on in.

1028
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:39,048
Thank you.

1029
00:49:01,072 --> 00:49:02,505
Hello?

1030
00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:04,040
Hey,
is amanda there?

1031
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:05,708
She's not here
at the moment.

1032
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:07,310
Can i take a message

1033
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:08,377
and ask who's
calling, please?

1034
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:10,112
This is alexander midnight.

1035
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:11,414
Hi, alex,
how you doing?

1036
00:49:11,482 --> 00:49:12,848
Is there something wrong
with your voice?

1037
00:49:12,917 --> 00:49:14,317
No, there's nothing
wrong with my voice.

1038
00:49:14,385 --> 00:49:15,518
What are you doing tonight?

1039
00:49:15,586 --> 00:49:16,686
Tonight?
Yeah.

1040
00:49:16,754 --> 00:49:18,054
I'm painting.

1041
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:19,288
Well, can you go out?
I want to show you something.

1042
00:49:19,357 --> 00:49:20,823
I don't think so.

1043
00:49:20,892 --> 00:49:22,458
Oh, come on, why not?

1044
00:49:22,527 --> 00:49:24,226
Because.

1045
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:25,561
Your nostrils are flaring.

1046
00:49:26,731 --> 00:49:27,863
Your nostrils are flaring.

1047
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:29,598
No, my nostrils
are not flaring, ok?

1048
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:30,967
Yes, they are.

1049
00:49:31,035 --> 00:49:32,468
I'm gonna come over, ok?

1050
00:49:32,537 --> 00:49:33,903
Ok. Ok, fine.

1051
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:35,204
Ok, but just
for an hour.

1052
00:49:35,273 --> 00:49:37,239
No problem, no problem,
just an hour.

1053
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,941
Ok. Bye.

1054
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:44,814
What a piece of work
is man?

1055
00:49:44,882 --> 00:49:47,316
How noble in reason?

1056
00:49:47,385 --> 00:49:52,355
Of infinite and faculties,
in form and moving.

1057
00:49:52,423 --> 00:49:55,124
How express and admirable.

1058
00:49:55,193 --> 00:49:58,794
In action,
how like an angel...

1059
00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:01,063
in apprehension.

1060
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:03,766
How like a god.

1061
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:06,869
The beauty of the world,

1062
00:50:06,938 --> 00:50:10,506
the paragon of animals.

1063
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:15,244
♪ My kitty, your kitty,
everybody's little kitty ♪

1064
00:50:15,313 --> 00:50:16,746

00:50:22,653 --> 00:50:25,321
Thanks, i'm glad
you like it.

1069
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:27,023
I find it attractive

1070
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:29,625
when a woman appreciates
a good wine.

1071
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:31,994
My ex-wife always
used to complain

1072
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,796
that it gave her a headache.

1073
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:36,265
Well...

1074
00:50:36,334 --> 00:50:38,100
so what happened?

1075
00:50:38,169 --> 00:50:40,236
If you don't mind
my asking.

1076
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:42,271
No, that's all right.

1077
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:45,741
I found out that she'd been
having an affair.

1078
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:48,077
For quite a long time.

1079
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,813
How awful.

1080
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:52,481
Yeah, it broke my heart.

1081
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:56,886
I'm just glad we didn't
have any kids.

1082
00:50:56,954 --> 00:50:59,855
But it's been a while now.

1083
00:50:59,924 --> 00:51:02,291
Since then i've been having
love affairs

1084
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,627
with french burgundies
from the seventies.

1085
00:51:04,695 --> 00:51:06,862
Cheers.

1086
00:51:19,544 --> 00:51:21,310
All right,
hold on.

1087
00:51:21,379 --> 00:51:22,778
I know what
this place is.

1088
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:25,014
I didn't come up here
to fuck you,

1089
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:27,149
so don't even think
about it, all right?

1090
00:51:27,218 --> 00:51:29,118
Whoa.

1091
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:31,587
Who hurt you so bad?

1092
00:51:33,024 --> 00:51:36,692
I'd never fuck you, ok?

1093
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:39,595
I just wanted to show you
one of my favorite places.

1094
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:44,767
Look...

1095
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:49,071
i really need you
right now...

1096
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,740
to be patient with me.

1097
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:55,111
It's not that i don't care,
because...

1098
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:56,779
i do.

1099
00:51:56,848 --> 00:51:58,981
I--i--

1100
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,585
i'm sorry.

1101
00:52:17,568 --> 00:52:20,302
God, you smell great.

1102
00:52:20,371 --> 00:52:23,205
Where did you take
this photo?

1103
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:25,007
Oh.

1104
00:52:25,076 --> 00:52:26,742
Well, i spent
a lot of time

1105
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:28,344
exploring
the serengeti,

1106
00:52:28,412 --> 00:52:30,579
and i took this shot
from the taita hills

1107
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:33,149
at about, uh,
7,000 feet.

1108
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:35,651
You can see for hundreds
of miles from this spot,

1109
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,319
and at night,
there'd be these

1110
00:52:37,388 --> 00:52:38,687
incredible
lightning storms

1111
00:52:38,756 --> 00:52:40,789
that just ignite
the entire plane.

1112
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,928
Beautiful, isn't it?

1113
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:48,597
Yeah.

1114
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:56,539
You know, heh,

1115
00:52:56,607 --> 00:52:58,374
we've talked about food.

1116
00:52:58,442 --> 00:53:00,242
Why don't we
talk about money?

1117
00:53:29,774 --> 00:53:31,840
What are you
thinking about?

1118
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:36,579
About the different ways
looking up at the stars

1119
00:53:36,647 --> 00:53:38,247
can make me feel.

1120
00:53:38,316 --> 00:53:41,250
Like how?

1121
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:43,252
Well...

1122
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:47,556
when you read things like...

1123
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:49,491
we're just one galaxy

1124
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,795
of some hundred thousand
million galaxies,

1125
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:54,563
and each galaxy itself

1126
00:53:54,632 --> 00:53:58,701
contains some hundred thousand
million stars.

1127
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:00,236
I mean...

1128
00:54:00,304 --> 00:54:02,137
how are you supposed
to get out of bed

1129
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:03,973
in the morning?

1130
00:54:07,211 --> 00:54:09,011
You know?

1131
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:14,016
It wasn't until...
last week that i realized...

1132
00:54:15,853 --> 00:54:18,921
i'd been afraid to look up
at the night sky.

1133
00:54:20,124 --> 00:54:24,093
You know, instead of being
in awe of it all

1134
00:54:24,161 --> 00:54:26,662
or amazed...

1135
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:29,398
at the mystery
and the beauty.

1136
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:34,103
That was terrifying.

1137
00:54:34,171 --> 00:54:37,606
Everything felt
unbearably huge.

1138
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:45,281
But then last night...

1139
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:48,517
i stayed up all night
just sittin' right here

1140
00:54:48,586 --> 00:54:50,352
thinkin'...

1141
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:56,859
and i was overcome
by the sense that...

1142
00:54:56,927 --> 00:54:59,128
everything was gonna be ok.

1143
00:54:59,196 --> 00:55:02,364
Even if i didn't really
understand why.

1144
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:14,243
And despite how fucked up
or chaotic things may seem,

1145
00:55:14,312 --> 00:55:15,778
it...

1146
00:55:15,846 --> 00:55:18,080
well, maybe there is
some order to it all.

1147
00:55:18,149 --> 00:55:22,985
I mean, it can't
just be coincidence.

1148
00:55:24,455 --> 00:55:26,922
There are the smallest
of perfections

1149
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:30,726
in the most...
unlikely places.

1150
00:55:30,795 --> 00:55:32,961
Like...

1151
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:37,566
the swell of your lips.

1152
00:55:40,438 --> 00:55:43,238
Or the curve of your breast.

1153
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:55,017
I want you to come, frankie.

1154
00:56:00,391 --> 00:56:02,891
I want to watch you come.

1155
00:56:18,409 --> 00:56:20,709
You know, i really should
get going.

1156
00:56:20,778 --> 00:56:21,877
Why?

1157
00:56:21,946 --> 00:56:23,145
Because i just don't think
we should be doing this.

1158
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:24,413
Why not?

1159
00:56:24,482 --> 00:56:27,082
Well, um, ow. Wait.

1160
00:56:27,151 --> 00:56:28,851
Wait a second.

1161
00:56:28,919 --> 00:56:30,586
You know, i don't--

1162
00:56:30,654 --> 00:56:33,455
wait, paul! No!

1163
00:56:33,524 --> 00:56:35,591
No, wait, please,
i don't want this.

1164
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:37,092
Why don't you
want this?

1165
00:56:37,161 --> 00:56:38,360
Because!

1166
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:39,962
No, no!

1167
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,431
No, paul, stop it!

1168
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,167
No! No!

1169
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:46,168
No!

1170
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:48,871
No!

1171
00:56:49,807 --> 00:56:51,340
Aah!

1172
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:58,981
I want to travel.

1173
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:01,583
Hmm, where to?

1174
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:05,487
I don't know.

1175
00:57:06,824 --> 00:57:08,457
It just seems like
the only thing

1176
00:57:08,526 --> 00:57:12,494
holding me to this down
are these dock lines and you.

1177
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:22,204
How the hell is that

1178
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:23,939
supposed
to make me feel?

1179
00:57:25,242 --> 00:57:27,109
What--

1180
00:57:27,178 --> 00:57:29,478
it means that i love you.

1181
00:57:33,684 --> 00:57:35,083
I want to go.

1182
00:57:35,152 --> 00:57:36,718
Will you
take me home?

1183
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:01,877
I'm sorry.

1184
00:58:01,946 --> 00:58:03,846
Tonight was such
a disaster.

1185
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:11,920
Do you want me
to come inside?

1186
00:58:12,857 --> 00:58:14,223
No, it's late.

1187
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:15,524
I have to get up
really early.

1188
00:58:23,534 --> 00:58:25,834
So...

1189
00:58:25,903 --> 00:58:28,570
tell me 3 images
from your childhood.

1190
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:29,505
Quick.

1191
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:31,907
Don't even think about it.

1192
00:58:31,976 --> 00:58:33,609
Cats,

1193
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,744
lime jell-o, and...

1194
00:58:35,813 --> 00:58:37,246
baseball games.

1195
00:58:37,314 --> 00:58:39,081
Good.

1196
00:58:39,149 --> 00:58:40,415
And you?

1197
00:58:40,484 --> 00:58:42,651
Me?
Mm-hmm.

1198
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,786
Kneeling, snow,

1199
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:47,789
and my twin brother.

1200
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:49,591
You have a twin brother?

1201
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,792
Mm-hmm.

1202
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:52,294
Charlie.

1203
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:54,263
Charlie midnight.

1204
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:55,564
He's excellent.

1205
00:58:55,633 --> 00:58:57,065
Oh, god.

1206
00:58:57,134 --> 00:58:59,368
Not another one of you.

1207
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:05,240
I gotta go.

1208
00:59:08,479 --> 00:59:10,579
So you'll remember me.

1209
00:59:15,753 --> 00:59:18,453
See you around, kid.

1210
00:59:28,566 --> 00:59:30,332
Are you mad at me?

1211
00:59:32,469 --> 00:59:34,503
No, i'm not mad at you.

1212
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:36,104
I'm just tired.

1213
00:59:39,343 --> 00:59:42,077
I'll see you tomorrow, ok?

1214
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:02,364
H-hey--

1215
01:00:16,046 --> 01:00:18,113
oh, my god.

1216
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:33,762
M.j.

1217
01:00:33,831 --> 01:00:36,365
w-wait--what--

1218
01:00:36,433 --> 01:00:37,733
what happened
to you?

1219
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:40,235
Hey. What
happened to you?

1220
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:41,870
My god.

1221
01:00:58,489 --> 01:00:59,988
It makes you wonder
what the word "no"

1222
01:01:00,057 --> 01:01:03,191
means to some
people, doesn't it?

1223
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:05,394
God.

1224
01:01:05,462 --> 01:01:07,229
I wonder how many
other women

1225
01:01:07,297 --> 01:01:08,897
this has happened to.

1226
01:01:08,966 --> 01:01:09,998
Tons.

1227
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:13,902
I offer no excuse
for those of my sex.

1228
01:01:15,305 --> 01:01:17,839
I mean, half the male ego
problem stems from the fact

1229
01:01:17,908 --> 01:01:20,909
that we can't have children.

1230
01:01:20,978 --> 01:01:23,412
Women are--are--
are so much more grounded

1231
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,480
because they can give
a child life.

1232
01:01:27,418 --> 01:01:30,652
Whereas men, they're in
this constant battle,

1233
01:01:30,721 --> 01:01:33,588
whether blatant or subtle,

1234
01:01:33,657 --> 01:01:36,858
to make their mark
in the world.

1235
01:01:36,927 --> 01:01:39,094
Well, he certainly
made his mark.

1236
01:01:39,163 --> 01:01:41,963
So why didn't you
nail his ass?

1237
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:43,765
M.j., it was like
you just let him

1238
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:45,100
get away with it.

1239
01:01:45,169 --> 01:01:47,602
Amanda, i really wish

1240
01:01:47,671 --> 01:01:50,605
you would stop
throwing this in my face.

1241
01:01:50,674 --> 01:01:52,340
Do you know
what i went through?

1242
01:01:52,409 --> 01:01:54,776
Do you have any idea?

1243
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:57,379
Have you ever been raped?

1244
01:01:57,448 --> 01:02:00,782
Well, if you're not gonna
deal with it legally,

1245
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:02,451
you know,
like pressing charges,

1246
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:05,754
i think maybe you should
work it out emotionally.

1247
01:02:06,924 --> 01:02:09,391
What are you talking about--

1248
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:10,625
emotionally?

1249
01:02:10,694 --> 01:02:12,194
Get in touch
with my feelings?

1250
01:02:12,262 --> 01:02:14,763
You're the ice princess
of the world

1251
01:02:14,832 --> 01:02:17,466
and you're telling me to get
in touch with my feelings.

1252
01:02:17,534 --> 01:02:20,135
I am talking about using it
as a fucking excuse

1253
01:02:20,204 --> 01:02:21,837
for treating the other
people in your life

1254
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:23,939
like shit.

1255
01:02:24,007 --> 01:02:26,341
Ohh...

1256
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:28,110
you know...

1257
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:32,948
whew. I thought
you understood.

1258
01:02:49,733 --> 01:02:51,166
What...

1259
01:02:51,235 --> 01:02:52,601
what time is it?

1260
01:02:52,669 --> 01:02:53,869
It's early.

1261
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:56,304
It's very early
and i'm sorry.

1262
01:02:56,373 --> 01:02:57,606
It's ok.

1263
01:02:57,674 --> 01:03:00,542
I've been up all night
fighting a panic attack.

1264
01:03:00,611 --> 01:03:04,079
Sometimes i just feel like
i'm--i'm so dried up inside

1265
01:03:04,148 --> 01:03:06,314
and that there's
something...

1266
01:03:06,383 --> 01:03:09,117
sucking the life
out of me and...

1267
01:03:09,186 --> 01:03:10,852
i don't know what--

1268
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:12,587
i try to fight it,
but...

1269
01:03:12,656 --> 01:03:13,855
come here.

1270
01:03:15,092 --> 01:03:17,025
Honey...

1271
01:03:17,094 --> 01:03:18,894
i'm sorry.

1272
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:22,030
Just think of what
you've been through.

1273
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:24,866
You know, i really think
that you should press charges

1274
01:03:24,935 --> 01:03:26,201
against this bastard.

1275
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:29,271
No. No, i just want to
put it all behind me.

1276
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:32,340
M.j., this fucker
raped you.

1277
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:35,377
You can't expect those
feelings just to disappear

1278
01:03:35,445 --> 01:03:37,712
3 weeks later.

1279
01:03:37,781 --> 01:03:41,216
Yeah, but, you know...

1280
01:03:41,285 --> 01:03:42,951
maybe--maybe i--

1281
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:44,619
maybe i brought it on
myself.

1282
01:03:44,688 --> 01:03:47,823
Don't you dare say that.

1283
01:03:47,891 --> 01:03:50,425
It's your body.

1284
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:53,128
He had no business forcing you
into doing something

1285
01:03:53,197 --> 01:03:54,896
that you did not want to do.

1286
01:03:54,965 --> 01:03:56,698
Yeah,
and then david said

1287
01:03:56,767 --> 01:03:58,433
that paul totally
lied to me,

1288
01:03:58,502 --> 01:04:00,101
that--that
it was his wife

1289
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:02,771
that caught him in bed
with another woman.

1290
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,539
I am such an idiot.

1291
01:04:04,608 --> 01:04:08,243
I can't believe
i fell for his crap.

1292
01:04:09,246 --> 01:04:11,079
He's a pig.

1293
01:04:11,148 --> 01:04:13,615
But, hey,

1294
01:04:13,684 --> 01:04:16,818
how are you
supposed to know?

1295
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:18,553
God, i...

1296
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:21,623
i just can't get it
out of my head.

1297
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:32,167
I'm sorry.

1298
01:04:44,748 --> 01:04:46,514
How you doin'?

1299
01:04:49,286 --> 01:04:51,686
Who's bones?

1300
01:04:51,755 --> 01:04:54,456
Frankie? Why her?

1301
01:04:54,524 --> 01:04:57,158
'Cause she's
so damn skinny.

1302
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:00,695
That's a good call.

1303
01:05:02,766 --> 01:05:04,966
I heard there was
a shooting last night.

1304
01:05:05,035 --> 01:05:06,034
What happened?

1305
01:05:06,103 --> 01:05:08,103
I don't know.

1306
01:05:08,171 --> 01:05:09,638
Mario, what happened?

1307
01:05:09,706 --> 01:05:10,839
A few of the boys

1308
01:05:10,908 --> 01:05:12,707
from the hood
did a drive-by

1309
01:05:12,776 --> 01:05:15,477
and wasted
some of the e.s.g.

1310
01:05:15,545 --> 01:05:17,178
were you there?

1311
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:18,313
No.

1312
01:05:18,382 --> 01:05:19,481
Mario.

1313
01:05:19,549 --> 01:05:21,416
No way.

1314
01:05:21,485 --> 01:05:26,421
I can't believe
2 kids are dead over graffiti.

1315
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:28,323
Yeah, well,
people get shot down here

1316
01:05:28,392 --> 01:05:29,891
for all sorts of reasons.

1317
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,027
That's just the way it is.

1318
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:33,662
Hey! What's you doin'?

1319
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:34,829
Cut it out.

1320
01:05:34,898 --> 01:05:36,164
I got you.

1321
01:05:36,233 --> 01:05:37,098
Hey, hey, hey.

1322
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:38,333
You're a menace.

1323
01:05:38,402 --> 01:05:39,734
Come over and help us paint.

1324
01:05:39,803 --> 01:05:41,836
I don't give a fuck
about your stupid mural.

1325
01:05:41,905 --> 01:05:44,439
You lied. You said you were
gonna take us to the beach.

1326
01:05:44,508 --> 01:05:45,440
Hey, hey, hey.

1327
01:05:45,509 --> 01:05:47,509
Come on, man,
chill, ok?

1328
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:48,677
You be cool.

1329
01:05:48,745 --> 01:05:51,646
Look. She's down
with us, homeboy,

1330
01:05:51,715 --> 01:05:53,782
so why don't you stop
causing scenes like this

1331
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:56,184
or we're not getting
any more paint,

1332
01:05:56,253 --> 01:05:58,353
do you understand?
Huh?

1333
01:05:58,422 --> 01:06:01,089
Ok, go on.
Go finish your work.

1334
01:06:02,225 --> 01:06:03,825
By the way, i lined up
the next space.

1335
01:06:03,894 --> 01:06:05,427
They're gonna pay you.

1336
01:06:06,596 --> 01:06:08,863
Cool.

1337
01:06:08,932 --> 01:06:10,031
Um...

1338
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,200
who's your friend
with the hair?

1339
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:14,369
That's my housemate.
Amanda?

1340
01:06:14,438 --> 01:06:16,371
Yeah?

1341
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:17,539
Mario.

1342
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:18,640
Mario, amanda.

1343
01:06:18,709 --> 01:06:19,841
How you doin'?

1344
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:21,409
Hi.

1345
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,011
I really like your work.

1346
01:06:24,281 --> 01:06:25,146
Uh, thank you.

1347
01:06:25,215 --> 01:06:26,247
You're welcome.

1348
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:28,917
Can i help you paint?

1349
01:06:28,986 --> 01:06:31,553
Yeah. Yeah,
that'd be great.

1350
01:06:31,621 --> 01:06:33,288
It'd be an honor.

1351
01:06:33,357 --> 01:06:34,556
Cool.

1352
01:06:36,793 --> 01:06:39,995
You can start over here
and, uh...

1353
01:06:57,781 --> 01:06:59,881
i'm famished.

1354
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:02,250
I'm always starving
before a show.

1355
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:05,387
I need more fuel
for maximum energy.

1356
01:07:05,455 --> 01:07:07,922
Oh, by the way,
did i mention

1357
01:07:07,991 --> 01:07:10,592
that i made a manikin
of you out of papier-mache?

1358
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:13,428
She sits in my bathtub
sipping a martini.

1359
01:07:13,497 --> 01:07:15,430
I tell her all my secrets,

1360
01:07:15,499 --> 01:07:16,965
and she just smiles.

1361
01:07:17,834 --> 01:07:19,434
Who is this guy?

1362
01:07:19,503 --> 01:07:21,036
Radical board, dude.

1363
01:07:21,104 --> 01:07:23,104
You been half-pipin' it
lately?

1364
01:07:23,173 --> 01:07:24,806
Alex,
this is willie.

1365
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:25,840
Willie, the little bro.

1366
01:07:25,909 --> 01:07:28,777
What's happenin'?
How's it hangin', slim?

1367
01:07:28,845 --> 01:07:29,778
Pretty good.

1368
01:07:29,846 --> 01:07:30,779
Cool.

1369
01:07:30,847 --> 01:07:32,447
I got baseball cards, minx.

1370
01:07:32,516 --> 01:07:33,548
Thanks, little bro.

1371
01:07:33,617 --> 01:07:34,883
Where you guys goin'
with this thing? Whoa.

1372
01:07:34,951 --> 01:07:36,451
We're gonna go hang these
at the club where alex

1373
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,952
is doing his performance
art piece tonight.

1374
01:07:38,021 --> 01:07:39,054
You gonna come, dude?

1375
01:07:39,122 --> 01:07:40,622
Well, if it's ok
with minx.

1376
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:42,257
Sure it is.

1377
01:07:42,325 --> 01:07:44,692
Yeah, you can get
a ride with m.j.

1378
01:07:44,761 --> 01:07:46,294
bye.

1379
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:47,295
Sexy.

1380
01:07:47,364 --> 01:07:48,296
Whoo!

1381
01:07:48,365 --> 01:07:50,231
Oh, i gotta show you
my place.

1382
01:07:52,102 --> 01:07:53,768
I hear you've been having

1383
01:07:53,837 --> 01:07:56,337
some sort of existential
meltdown.

1384
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:59,908
May i recommend
a bottle of wild turkey,

1385
01:07:59,976 --> 01:08:02,210
a copy of sartre's
<i>la nausee,</i>

1386
01:08:02,279 --> 01:08:03,545
and a double-barreled
shotgun

1387
01:08:03,613 --> 01:08:05,346
to cure this affliction.

1388
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:08,616
Come on, it's a joke.

1389
01:08:09,486 --> 01:08:10,885
Yeah.

1390
01:08:10,954 --> 01:08:13,455
I'm--i'm glad
you're here.

1391
01:08:13,523 --> 01:08:15,223
I've been wanting
to talk to you.

1392
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:16,357
About?

1393
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:19,627
About what happened to me
a couple weeks ago.

1394
01:08:19,696 --> 01:08:21,262
I want to say thank you.

1395
01:08:21,331 --> 01:08:24,232
You don't have to thank me.

1396
01:08:24,301 --> 01:08:27,635
No. It really meant a lot,
you being there like that,

1397
01:08:27,704 --> 01:08:29,504
and i just wanted to say...

1398
01:08:29,573 --> 01:08:31,673
thank you.

1399
01:08:31,741 --> 01:08:33,508
You just tell me
where he lives,

1400
01:08:33,577 --> 01:08:36,344
i swear i'll kick
the shit out of him.

1401
01:08:36,413 --> 01:08:39,581
Oh, no. I'm just trying
to put it behind me.

1402
01:08:41,351 --> 01:08:45,653
I'm just sorry
that it happened to you.

1403
01:08:45,722 --> 01:08:47,055
Friends?

1404
01:08:51,228 --> 01:08:54,362
You know what
the really sad part is?

1405
01:08:54,431 --> 01:08:56,431
For a minute there,
it felt like somebody

1406
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,633
was out there for me.

1407
01:09:01,338 --> 01:09:02,704
Yeah, right.

1408
01:09:06,276 --> 01:09:07,475
Sometimes i wonder

1409
01:09:07,544 --> 01:09:09,911
if there's any hope
for romance.

1410
01:09:12,949 --> 01:09:14,983
This is it.

1411
01:09:15,952 --> 01:09:17,185
Oh, wow.

1412
01:09:17,254 --> 01:09:18,319
This is great.

1413
01:09:18,388 --> 01:09:20,788
Yes, i'm into
organized chaos.

1414
01:09:20,857 --> 01:09:21,890
I can see that.

1415
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:23,391
Oh, wait.

1416
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:24,392
What?

1417
01:09:24,461 --> 01:09:25,994
I have something
for you.

1418
01:09:26,062 --> 01:09:27,328
I'll get it.

1419
01:09:31,301 --> 01:09:33,768
So, um, finish telling me

1420
01:09:33,837 --> 01:09:36,404
about this--this crazy
theory of yours.

1421
01:09:36,473 --> 01:09:39,374
What did you call it--
accessible...

1422
01:09:39,442 --> 01:09:42,010
happiness. My theory
of accessible happiness.

1423
01:09:42,078 --> 01:09:44,312
And it's not crazy.

1424
01:09:44,381 --> 01:09:48,416
See, if you can think
of 3 accessible things,

1425
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:50,351
little things
that make you happy,

1426
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:52,420
that you can
always count on,

1427
01:09:52,489 --> 01:09:55,089
because they are
immediately attainable.

1428
01:09:55,158 --> 01:09:57,125
It works.

1429
01:09:57,194 --> 01:09:58,593
Like for me.

1430
01:09:58,662 --> 01:10:01,262
I have my motorcycle,

1431
01:10:01,331 --> 01:10:02,764
led zeppelin,

1432
01:10:02,832 --> 01:10:04,766
and my third thing is--

1433
01:10:04,834 --> 01:10:06,100
oh, god.

1434
01:10:06,169 --> 01:10:08,603
Big sandwiches.

1435
01:10:10,006 --> 01:10:10,939
All right.

1436
01:10:11,007 --> 01:10:11,940
Good as mine.

1437
01:10:12,008 --> 01:10:13,274
Ohh!

1438
01:10:13,343 --> 01:10:14,275
Oh!

1439
01:10:14,344 --> 01:10:15,443
Oh, god!

1440
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:17,245
Ohh!

1441
01:10:17,314 --> 01:10:19,147
Damn.

1442
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:21,149
You broke my nose,
you creep!

1443
01:10:21,218 --> 01:10:22,450
Good.

1444
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:26,254
So, in the 12th century

1445
01:10:26,323 --> 01:10:28,289
there was this radical
mutation in human feelings

1446
01:10:28,358 --> 01:10:29,624
and consciousness.

1447
01:10:29,693 --> 01:10:34,162
It was then that the origins
of romantic love can be found.

1448
01:10:34,231 --> 01:10:35,863
People finally
began saying fuck you

1449
01:10:35,932 --> 01:10:37,098
to prearranged marriages,

1450
01:10:37,167 --> 01:10:38,533
going against
the church's will,

1451
01:10:38,602 --> 01:10:41,803
willing to risk
burning in hell for love.

1452
01:10:41,871 --> 01:10:44,205
It was the time of those
crazy troubadours

1453
01:10:44,274 --> 01:10:47,542
who wore tight velvet pants
and sang songs of love

1454
01:10:47,611 --> 01:10:49,944
to ladies who tested
and tortured them

1455
01:10:50,013 --> 01:10:51,980
and made them wait.

1456
01:10:52,048 --> 01:10:53,648
But they waited...

1457
01:10:53,717 --> 01:10:56,384
because it was for true love.

1458
01:10:56,453 --> 01:10:58,953
Do you ever stop talking?

1459
01:10:59,022 --> 01:11:01,689
So, after fighting
many silly battles--

1460
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:02,690
whoo--

1461
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,159
and standing around
and guarding

1462
01:11:05,228 --> 01:11:06,394
unnecessary bridges

1463
01:11:06,463 --> 01:11:07,829
and waiting in the rain

1464
01:11:07,897 --> 01:11:10,498
reciting endless poetry...

1465
01:11:10,567 --> 01:11:12,200
the ladies

1466
01:11:12,269 --> 01:11:13,835
would either refuse
the troubadours

1467
01:11:13,903 --> 01:11:15,803
or accept them as lovers,

1468
01:11:15,872 --> 01:11:17,538
by saying...

1469
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:20,208
<i>merci.</i>

1470
01:11:20,277 --> 01:11:22,076
<i>Merci beaucoup, mon amour.</i>

1471
01:11:29,386 --> 01:11:31,919
Isn't that incredible?

1472
01:11:31,988 --> 01:11:33,921
You have to read this book.

1473
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:35,356
All of these books.

1474
01:11:35,425 --> 01:11:37,392
Do you know what
they all have in common?

1475
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:39,193
I have no idea.

1476
01:11:39,262 --> 01:11:41,029
They all have something
interesting to say

1477
01:11:41,097 --> 01:11:43,064
on page 36.

1478
01:11:43,133 --> 01:11:44,065
Page 36.

1479
01:11:44,134 --> 01:11:44,966
Yes.

1480
01:11:45,035 --> 01:11:46,200
It's a 9 number.

1481
01:11:46,269 --> 01:11:47,535
The number 9 represents

1482
01:11:47,604 --> 01:11:49,671
contact with the inner soul,

1483
01:11:49,739 --> 01:11:51,039
greater self-expression,

1484
01:11:51,107 --> 01:11:52,707
the order of the angels.

1485
01:11:52,776 --> 01:11:53,841
Ok.

1486
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:55,209
It's a little trick
i picked up

1487
01:11:55,278 --> 01:11:56,978
from granny midnight.

1488
01:11:57,047 --> 01:12:01,049
You'd be surprised.
She also gave me black panthie.

1489
01:12:01,117 --> 01:12:04,185
And my pet
emperor scorpion sufi.

1490
01:12:04,254 --> 01:12:05,887
Would you like to meet him?

1491
01:12:05,955 --> 01:12:07,722
No.

1492
01:12:07,791 --> 01:12:08,890
Sufi.

1493
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:10,725
Come here. Su--

1494
01:12:10,794 --> 01:12:12,060
no, stop it.

1495
01:12:12,128 --> 01:12:12,994
Wait a minute.

1496
01:12:13,063 --> 01:12:14,529
Oh! Don't do that.

1497
01:12:21,137 --> 01:12:22,403
This looks like fun.

1498
01:12:22,472 --> 01:12:25,640
Yeah, it looks
flea-infested to me.

1499
01:12:25,709 --> 01:12:26,941
Yeah.
Am i nervous?

1500
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:28,476
Well, no, now that
your paintings are here,

1501
01:12:28,545 --> 01:12:30,845
i think everything's
gonna work out fine.

1502
01:12:30,914 --> 01:12:31,946
It's gonna be great.

1503
01:12:32,015 --> 01:12:32,947
Yeah?

1504
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:33,948
Amanda.

1505
01:12:34,017 --> 01:12:34,949
Hey.
Hi.

1506
01:12:35,018 --> 01:12:35,950
It looks great.

1507
01:12:36,019 --> 01:12:36,951
Hi, m.j.

1508
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:37,919
it looks fantastic.

1509
01:12:37,987 --> 01:12:39,687
Oh, my god,
you're gonna be so famous.

1510
01:12:39,756 --> 01:12:41,122
I'm so proud of you.

1511
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:44,892
Willie's stuck at the door.
The bouncer won't let him in.

1512
01:12:44,961 --> 01:12:46,427
Bubba won't let him in?

1513
01:12:46,496 --> 01:12:47,362
No.

1514
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:50,331
Ok, i'm gonna
take care of it.

1515
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,966
Hi, ladies.

1516
01:12:54,971 --> 01:12:56,404
Forrest walrath.

1517
01:12:56,473 --> 01:12:57,839
I'm 24 years old.

1518
01:12:57,907 --> 01:12:59,107
I'm a virgo.

1519
01:12:59,175 --> 01:13:02,276
Uh... i was born
in 19...

1520
01:13:02,345 --> 01:13:03,845
i come here--
i come here a lot.

1521
01:13:03,913 --> 01:13:05,947
Uh... i do.
I really--

1522
01:13:06,015 --> 01:13:06,848
bubba. Bubba,
uh, listen,

1523
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:08,583
this guy's
a special visitor...

1524
01:13:13,223 --> 01:13:14,155
ok, thanks.

1525
01:13:14,224 --> 01:13:15,156
Thanks, big, uh...

1526
01:13:15,225 --> 01:13:16,824
uh, bubba.

1527
01:13:27,303 --> 01:13:28,569
Where's frankie?

1528
01:13:28,638 --> 01:13:30,571
That's a good question.

1529
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,907
I'm starting to get
worried about her.

1530
01:13:32,976 --> 01:13:35,910
I don't like the idea
of her downtown this late.

1531
01:13:35,979 --> 01:13:37,512
It's not really safe.

1532
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:38,613
Yeah, i know.

1533
01:13:38,681 --> 01:13:40,281
But she knows
what she's doing.

1534
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:42,817
She's been doing it
for a long time.

1535
01:13:42,886 --> 01:13:44,652
Look, if you're
really worried,

1536
01:13:44,721 --> 01:13:47,155
you can take my car.

1537
01:13:47,223 --> 01:13:49,490
Ah--

1538
01:13:49,559 --> 01:13:51,659
yeah, i mi--
yeah, i will.

1539
01:13:51,728 --> 01:13:52,593
Yeah.
Thank you.

1540
01:13:52,662 --> 01:13:54,362
I'll see you later.

1541
01:13:56,366 --> 01:13:57,432
You gotta stay,
because all the guys

1542
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,666
will be coming down
and we'll be going down--

1543
01:13:58,735 --> 01:13:59,667
i gotta go.

1544
01:13:59,736 --> 01:14:00,568
No, come on, please?

1545
01:14:00,637 --> 01:14:02,770
It'll be live.

1546
01:14:02,839 --> 01:14:04,739
We'll be jamming.

1547
01:14:04,808 --> 01:14:05,807
I don't know.

1548
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:07,208
Boom box.

1549
01:14:07,277 --> 01:14:08,409
Noise.

1550
01:14:08,478 --> 01:14:09,610
Dancing.

1551
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:10,611
Hey, what's up?

1552
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,847
Hey, man,
what's up, homes?

1553
01:14:12,916 --> 01:14:14,248
The mural looks great, <i>ese.</i>

1554
01:14:14,317 --> 01:14:15,516
Doesn't it look nice?

1555
01:14:15,585 --> 01:14:17,752
You like the colors?

1556
01:14:17,821 --> 01:14:19,520
Man, all that work...

1557
01:14:19,589 --> 01:14:21,522
work, you know?

1558
01:14:22,592 --> 01:14:23,458
Ladies and gentlemen,

1559
01:14:23,526 --> 01:14:25,526
let's give a big
round of applause

1560
01:14:25,595 --> 01:14:29,764
to mr. Alexander midnight!

1561
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:43,110
When i think about my life,

1562
01:14:43,179 --> 01:14:46,547
it seems to be composed
of random images,

1563
01:14:46,616 --> 01:14:48,382
all stored in my brain

1564
01:14:48,451 --> 01:14:51,419
like pictures
in a photo album.

1565
01:14:51,488 --> 01:14:54,155
Often, for no reason at all,

1566
01:14:54,224 --> 01:14:57,792
i'll think of some lost part
of my childhood.

1567
01:14:57,861 --> 01:15:00,161
The smell
of my mother's hair.

1568
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:01,896
My dad's big hands,

1569
01:15:01,965 --> 01:15:04,732
coarse and callused.

1570
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:07,535
Lime jell-o
in the afternoon.

1571
01:15:07,604 --> 01:15:08,569
Waah!

1572
01:15:08,638 --> 01:15:10,938
Lightning bugs
in thick glass jars.

1573
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:12,773
Aaaahhh...

1574
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:14,575
sometimes,
if i think hard enough,

1575
01:15:14,644 --> 01:15:19,313
i can see myself
a child again.

1576
01:15:19,382 --> 01:15:28,322
Aaaahhhh!

1577
01:15:28,391 --> 01:15:36,264
Aaaahhhhh!

1578
01:15:46,075 --> 01:15:47,675
When i was about 12,

1579
01:15:47,744 --> 01:15:49,076
i remember
lying awake in my bed

1580
01:15:49,145 --> 01:15:51,145
on a quiet, dark night,

1581
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:53,948
feeling my heart pulse,

1582
01:15:54,017 --> 01:15:55,650
pulse, pulse,

1583
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:57,785
pulse, pulse,

1584
01:15:57,854 --> 01:15:59,787
throughout my whole body.

1585
01:15:59,856 --> 01:16:01,188
For the first time,

1586
01:16:01,257 --> 01:16:03,791
i understood that someday

1587
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:05,459
it would be still.

1588
01:16:05,528 --> 01:16:06,994
I became petrified,

1589
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:08,963
and i stayed awake
all night sweating,

1590
01:16:09,032 --> 01:16:10,965
with my eyes wide,

1591
01:16:11,034 --> 01:16:13,367
for i knew
if i fell asleep,

1592
01:16:13,436 --> 01:16:15,336
i would die!

1593
01:16:15,405 --> 01:16:16,337
Whoo!

1594
01:16:16,406 --> 01:16:17,638
Whoo-hoo.

1595
01:16:17,707 --> 01:16:19,807
Yeah!

1596
01:16:19,876 --> 01:16:20,808
Whoo, yeah!

1597
01:16:20,877 --> 01:16:21,976
I have since
come to terms

1598
01:16:22,045 --> 01:16:23,678
with the fact
that i will die.

1599
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:28,416
I tell myself that death
is just a part of life,

1600
01:16:28,484 --> 01:16:30,484
and many people
have done it before me.

1601
01:16:30,553 --> 01:16:33,654
Still i wonder,
where do we go?

1602
01:16:33,723 --> 01:16:37,325
From here to there
and back again.

1603
01:16:37,393 --> 01:16:38,859
An entrance

1604
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:41,862
into infinite
possibilities...

1605
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:45,533
ssssss!

1606
01:16:48,571 --> 01:16:50,738
There are times
when i wake up early,

1607
01:16:50,807 --> 01:16:53,674
perhaps on
a saturday morning,

1608
01:16:53,743 --> 01:16:56,844
with sunlight
pouring through the window.

1609
01:16:56,913 --> 01:16:58,512
And i blink a few times,

1610
01:16:58,581 --> 01:17:01,716
maybe rub my eyes,

1611
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:03,017
and i put my feet

1612
01:17:03,086 --> 01:17:04,752
on the cool...

1613
01:17:04,821 --> 01:17:06,754
wood... floor.

1614
01:17:06,823 --> 01:17:08,656
And i look outside,

1615
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:11,659
and i see a slow blur
of color and motion,

1616
01:17:11,728 --> 01:17:15,863
which discriminates
into cars and bicycles,

1617
01:17:15,932 --> 01:17:19,100
young couples with strollers
and shopping bags,

1618
01:17:19,168 --> 01:17:22,269
sea gulls--awk! Awk! Awk!

1619
01:17:22,338 --> 01:17:24,038
Old men on benches.

1620
01:17:24,107 --> 01:17:26,207
I drink a cup
of cuban coffee

1621
01:17:26,275 --> 01:17:29,543
and make a list
entitled "today."

1622
01:17:29,612 --> 01:17:31,245
On these mornings,

1623
01:17:31,314 --> 01:17:33,247
everything is clear
and sharp,

1624
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:35,583
and i often marvel
at how beautifully

1625
01:17:35,652 --> 01:17:37,051
everything is put together.

1626
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,186
The laws of physics
and chemistry

1627
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:43,791
that have somehow interacted
to maintain this world.

1628
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:45,726
What is your contribution,

1629
01:17:45,795 --> 01:17:49,463
i ask myself in the mirror?

1630
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:57,705
Whoo!

1631
01:18:25,868 --> 01:18:27,902
I am alone, floating,

1632
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:30,771
seeking the rapture
of being alive,

1633
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:33,774
my mind
fragrant with memories.

1634
01:18:33,843 --> 01:18:36,477
I do not try to figure out
where i am going.

1635
01:18:36,546 --> 01:18:40,147
I simply live my life
from day to day

1636
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:43,584
and let the strange
forces of destiny

1637
01:18:43,653 --> 01:18:44,919
take me where they may!

1638
01:18:44,987 --> 01:18:46,120
Look out!

1639
01:18:51,861 --> 01:18:54,428
I am a happy man.

1640
01:19:00,203 --> 01:19:01,202
Yeah!

1641
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:02,203
All right!

1642
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:03,204
Whoo!

1643
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:08,709
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

1644
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:12,680
Whoo-hoo!

1645
01:19:12,749 --> 01:19:15,182
Boy, did you miss
a hell of a show, man.

1646
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:16,650
Hey there, buddy,
what are you doing

1647
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:17,752
sitting in the dark?

1648
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:19,220
She's still not back.

1649
01:19:19,288 --> 01:19:22,256
No call, no message,
nothin'.

1650
01:19:22,325 --> 01:19:24,291
I'm, like, ready
to call the police.

1651
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,327
Relax. They're probably
celebrating

1652
01:19:26,395 --> 01:19:27,394
because they just
finished the mural.

1653
01:19:27,463 --> 01:19:29,396
I wouldn't alert the lapd.

1654
01:19:29,465 --> 01:19:31,665
That's a long time
to celebrate.

1655
01:19:33,236 --> 01:19:35,469
Well, i wish
frankie was here

1656
01:19:35,538 --> 01:19:37,671
because i have something
kind of important

1657
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:39,006
to tell everybody.

1658
01:19:39,075 --> 01:19:40,775
Um...

1659
01:19:43,513 --> 01:19:45,846
i've been accepted
into steppenwolf.

1660
01:19:45,915 --> 01:19:47,181
Hey, congratulations!

1661
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:49,383
Oh, that is so cool.

1662
01:19:50,753 --> 01:19:52,353
What the hell
does that mean?

1663
01:19:52,421 --> 01:19:53,521
It means i'm moving
to chicago january 1st

1664
01:19:53,589 --> 01:19:54,722
to get back
into the theater!

1665
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:58,025
Score! Then i can move
into your room, bro.

1666
01:19:58,094 --> 01:19:59,193
Congratulations, honey.

1667
01:19:59,262 --> 01:20:00,461
Thank you so much.

1668
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:01,862
I'm really proud of you.

1669
01:20:01,931 --> 01:20:03,330
We're gonna miss you.

1670
01:20:03,399 --> 01:20:05,432
I'm gonna miss you, too.

1671
01:20:05,501 --> 01:20:07,535
Well, here's to
the windy city

1672
01:20:07,603 --> 01:20:09,370
and to getting the fuck
out of los angeles.

1673
01:20:09,438 --> 01:20:10,471
You know, there's
a few things about l.a.

1674
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:11,539
you're gonna miss.

1675
01:20:11,607 --> 01:20:13,274
Yeah, like, uh,
not getting a seat

1676
01:20:13,342 --> 01:20:14,708
at a restaurant
unless you've been

1677
01:20:14,777 --> 01:20:17,578
in the arts and entertainment
section recently, like, uh--

1678
01:20:17,647 --> 01:20:19,046
trapped on the 405
on friday.

1679
01:20:19,115 --> 01:20:20,080
Yeah. Like, uh--

1680
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:21,382
meeting new
and interesting people

1681
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:22,583
who have something
to talk about

1682
01:20:22,652 --> 01:20:24,451
other than film
and who's fucking who.

1683
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,720
Exactly my point.

1684
01:20:26,789 --> 01:20:27,721
Congratulations.

1685
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:28,989
Thank you very much.

1686
01:20:29,058 --> 01:20:29,990
Let's go party.

1687
01:20:30,059 --> 01:20:31,225
Let's party.

1688
01:20:31,294 --> 01:20:32,393
To chicago.

1689
01:20:32,461 --> 01:20:33,828
No, i don't drink,
thank you.

1690
01:20:33,896 --> 01:20:35,496
That's cool.

1691
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:37,698
Great job, alex.

1692
01:20:37,767 --> 01:20:40,968
I'll be in in a second. Ok?

1693
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,472
Oh.

1694
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:47,842
Hey, minx. Want a cheese
and pickle sandwich?

1695
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:49,343
Cool it with the beer.

1696
01:20:52,381 --> 01:20:53,814
Here.

1697
01:20:53,883 --> 01:20:54,915
Unh.

1698
01:20:54,984 --> 01:20:56,183
So this is great.

1699
01:20:56,252 --> 01:20:58,052
I get to move
into banks' room.

1700
01:20:58,120 --> 01:20:59,220
Finally!

1701
01:20:59,288 --> 01:21:00,588
Willie, you can't
move in here.

1702
01:21:00,656 --> 01:21:02,523
Willie.
Sure i can.

1703
01:21:02,592 --> 01:21:04,191
You are 16 years old.

1704
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:05,759
You have to go
to high school,

1705
01:21:05,828 --> 01:21:07,194
and you have to live
with dad.

1706
01:21:07,263 --> 01:21:09,096
Well, maybe i don't
want to live with dad.

1707
01:21:09,165 --> 01:21:10,531
And if you don't
want me here,

1708
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,099
i'll just find
someplace else.

1709
01:21:12,168 --> 01:21:13,968
Sweetie,
listen to me, all right?

1710
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:16,437
It's not that
we don't want you here. Ok?

1711
01:21:16,505 --> 01:21:19,540
You just gotta slow down
a little bit.

1712
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:25,179
Besides, dad and sharon
want you with them, so--

1713
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,280
yeah, right.

1714
01:21:26,349 --> 01:21:28,749
I think they'd be thrilled
if i wasn't there.

1715
01:21:28,818 --> 01:21:30,718
I mean, you don't--you don't
know what it's like.

1716
01:21:30,786 --> 01:21:32,553
You haven't lived at home
for years.

1717
01:21:32,622 --> 01:21:35,122
Maybe you're right.

1718
01:21:35,191 --> 01:21:37,691
But you know something,
willie?

1719
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:40,461
Mama's been dead
a long time.

1720
01:21:40,529 --> 01:21:43,530
And dad, i don't know,
he's...

1721
01:21:43,599 --> 01:21:46,600
he's just trying
to live his life.

1722
01:21:48,037 --> 01:21:50,137
And i understand completely

1723
01:21:50,206 --> 01:21:51,839
why you are angry at him,

1724
01:21:51,908 --> 01:21:53,340
but trust me,

1725
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:56,644
in time, you will learn
to forgive him.

1726
01:21:56,712 --> 01:21:58,646
I doubt that.

1727
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:11,258
I know you're gonna think
i'm a queer for saying this.

1728
01:22:12,561 --> 01:22:15,663
But i love you.

1729
01:22:15,731 --> 01:22:19,099
And i would absolutely do
anything in the world for you.

1730
01:22:22,338 --> 01:22:24,471
But you can't move in here.

1731
01:22:32,315 --> 01:22:33,881
Mmm...

1732
01:22:44,927 --> 01:22:48,896
want some potato chips
with your sandwich?

1733
01:22:48,965 --> 01:22:51,198
No.

1734
01:22:51,267 --> 01:22:52,433
Ok.

1735
01:22:57,206 --> 01:22:59,373
There's some pillows
and blankets on the couch.

1736
01:22:59,442 --> 01:23:01,041
You can sleep there tonight.

1737
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:03,243
All right?

1738
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:05,045

sorry.

1803
01:27:08,457 --> 01:27:10,991
I don't know
what to say.

1804
01:27:12,595 --> 01:27:15,495
You just gotta
keep in mind, frankie...

1805
01:27:16,966 --> 01:27:19,166

Mario's dead,

1809
01:27:31,547 --> 01:27:34,681
and, um... mm...

1810
01:27:37,386 --> 01:27:40,420
i really would have liked
to have saved him.

1811
01:28:32,107 --> 01:28:34,174
Ohh...

1812
01:28:44,119 --> 01:28:45,952
ohh...

1813
01:28:46,021 --> 01:28:46,953
oh, god.

1814
01:28:47,022 --> 01:28:48,889
The one day
i get to sleep in.

1815
01:28:48,957 --> 01:28:50,424
Oh, god--

1816
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:52,893
oh.

1817
01:29:13,315 --> 01:29:15,816
Goddamn it.

1818
01:29:15,884 --> 01:29:17,551
Great.
There's no ginger ale.

1819
01:29:17,619 --> 01:29:19,619
Is it my imagination
or do these guys

1820
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:21,988
just blow leaves
from one pile to another?

1821
01:29:22,057 --> 01:29:24,825
What is willie doing
in your bed?

1822
01:29:24,893 --> 01:29:27,661
I really can't believe
that a 16-year-old is--

1823
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:31,331
amanda, i didn't sleep
with your brother.

1824
01:29:44,747 --> 01:29:48,281
Bet you can't catch me!
Bet you can't catch me!

1825
01:29:48,350 --> 01:29:50,951
I bet i can! I bet i can!

1826
01:29:51,019 --> 01:29:52,619
Banks, i need you
to make sure

1827
01:29:52,688 --> 01:29:54,621
all the christmas lights
are plugged in.

1828
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:55,622
Already done.

1829
01:29:55,691 --> 01:29:57,224
This is my last cigarette
of the year.

1830
01:29:57,292 --> 01:29:58,625
Good new year's
resolution,

1831
01:29:58,694 --> 01:30:01,628
but according to the paper,
out of the last 365 days,

1832
01:30:01,697 --> 01:30:04,631
the air in l.a.
was found unfit to breathe

1833
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:05,732
189 days.

1834
01:30:05,801 --> 01:30:07,968
That's ridiculous.
189 days?

1835
01:30:08,036 --> 01:30:10,670
Why would anybody
live here?

1836
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:11,805
Tell me about it.

1837
01:30:11,874 --> 01:30:13,039
I think we should all
move to bali.

1838
01:30:13,108 --> 01:30:16,042
That's totally screwed up.
Willie, keys.

1839
01:30:16,111 --> 01:30:17,544
All right, guys,
we gotta concentrate,

1840
01:30:17,613 --> 01:30:19,813
just gotta breathe,
just gotta concentrate.

1841
01:30:19,882 --> 01:30:20,981
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1842
01:30:21,049 --> 01:30:25,552
These guys gotta cool out
with this party anxiety.

1843
01:30:26,789 --> 01:30:27,954
Oh!

1844
01:30:29,625 --> 01:30:30,757
Right here?

1845
01:30:30,826 --> 01:30:32,492
You want to know the key
to my sister's heart?

1846
01:30:32,561 --> 01:30:33,493
Mm-hmm.

1847
01:30:35,230 --> 01:30:38,231
Orange marshmallow
peanuts.

1848
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:42,669
If 75 people don't show up,
my reputation's ruined!

1849
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:47,174
Trust me,
she loves these.

1850
01:30:48,777 --> 01:30:51,211
I could owe you big
on this one, bud.

1851
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:52,345
Yes, you could.

1852
01:30:52,414 --> 01:30:54,681
Yes, you could.
Ha ha.

1853
01:31:04,026 --> 01:31:05,258
How we doin', sweetie?

1854
01:31:05,327 --> 01:31:07,093
Well, i think
this party's a smash

1855
01:31:07,162 --> 01:31:09,196
as long as more of
the hollywood elite show.

1856
01:31:09,264 --> 01:31:10,964
And you wonder why nobody
entertains in l.a.

1857
01:31:11,033 --> 01:31:13,767
one lousy party
and your life can be shattered.

1858
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:16,770
Lots of chicks.

1859
01:31:16,839 --> 01:31:18,538
Oh, you saw <i>backlash.</i>

1860
01:31:18,607 --> 01:31:19,706
Thanks.

1861
01:31:19,775 --> 01:31:22,642
Barbara eden really went
the distance on that one.

1862
01:31:22,711 --> 01:31:23,977
Hey, how are you?

1863
01:31:25,881 --> 01:31:27,481
Alex.

1864
01:31:29,618 --> 01:31:32,052
Why are you always
grinning?

1865
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:34,120
Copious amounts
of wild sex

1866
01:31:34,189 --> 01:31:36,723
and fine hallucinogens.

1867
01:31:38,694 --> 01:31:40,727
So help me god!

1868
01:31:42,297 --> 01:31:43,730
Having a little
trouble, amanda?

1869
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,066
Come on! Come on!

1870
01:31:46,134 --> 01:31:47,534
Oh!

1871
01:31:48,704 --> 01:31:50,937
I didn't invite him.

1872
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:52,639
Hey, guys,
can i come in?

1873
01:31:52,708 --> 01:31:54,074
Close the door,
already!

1874
01:31:54,142 --> 01:31:55,909
Oh!

1875
01:31:57,513 --> 01:31:59,346
My face is crooked.

1876
01:31:59,414 --> 01:32:00,347
Oh, ok.

1877
01:32:00,415 --> 01:32:01,948
You worry way too much.

1878
01:32:02,017 --> 01:32:04,417
I can't believe
either one of you told me

1879
01:32:04,486 --> 01:32:06,152
i have this thing
in my teeth.

1880
01:32:07,222 --> 01:32:10,290
Everyone having fun?

1881
01:32:10,359 --> 01:32:12,058
Yeah, except
the one guy i like.

1882
01:32:12,127 --> 01:32:13,760
He's more interested
in banks.

1883
01:32:13,829 --> 01:32:15,862
Henry keeps following me
around.

1884
01:32:15,931 --> 01:32:17,964
I'm sorry,
henry bugs me.

1885
01:32:18,033 --> 01:32:20,233
What about you?
What about your boyfriend alex?

1886
01:32:20,302 --> 01:32:21,668
He's not my boyfriend.

1887
01:32:21,737 --> 01:32:23,770
Nuh-uh.

1888
01:32:23,839 --> 01:32:26,106
So, frankie,
how was the funeral?

1889
01:32:26,174 --> 01:32:28,074
It was pretty depressing.

1890
01:32:28,143 --> 01:32:29,910
Uch. It must have
been a nightmare.

1891
01:32:29,978 --> 01:32:32,412
Was it really sad
being down there?

1892
01:32:32,481 --> 01:32:35,048
You know,
mario was a real good guy.

1893
01:32:35,117 --> 01:32:36,783
Yeah, he was.

1894
01:32:37,786 --> 01:32:39,519
There's so much
going on, you guys.

1895
01:32:39,588 --> 01:32:41,187
I got offered a job,

1896
01:32:41,256 --> 01:32:44,391
with the van horne
foundation in san francisco.

1897
01:32:44,459 --> 01:32:45,492
San francisco?

1898
01:32:45,561 --> 01:32:46,726
Frankie, that's great.

1899
01:32:46,795 --> 01:32:48,895
I don't know.
I love my life here, you know?

1900
01:32:48,964 --> 01:32:50,263
Why should i
give this all up?

1901
01:32:50,332 --> 01:32:51,631
Because
it's a career move,

1902
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:53,266
an opportunity.
Money.

1903
01:32:53,335 --> 01:32:55,969
Taylor talked you
out of it, didn't he?

1904
01:32:56,038 --> 01:32:58,238
He doesn't even know yet.

1905
01:33:01,543 --> 01:33:02,576
Come on!

1906
01:33:02,644 --> 01:33:04,778
Keep your pants on!

1907
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:10,317
God! Oh, henry.

1908
01:33:10,385 --> 01:33:11,318
Hi, henry.

1909
01:33:11,386 --> 01:33:12,552
Hello, henry.

1910
01:33:12,621 --> 01:33:14,154
What the hell you suppose
they've been doing in there?

1911
01:33:14,222 --> 01:33:16,856
Women--they have this thing
about pissing in packs.

1912
01:33:26,802 --> 01:33:29,669
Smoking is for the weak.

1913
01:33:29,738 --> 01:33:30,670
Um, excuse me.

1914
01:33:30,739 --> 01:33:32,105
I need to borrow them
for a minute.

1915
01:33:32,174 --> 01:33:35,408
We're doing a group
photo thing, so...

1916
01:33:35,477 --> 01:33:37,043
what--
what are you doing?

1917
01:33:37,112 --> 01:33:38,545
Group photo!

1918
01:33:39,982 --> 01:33:41,715
Hey, you guys, where's--

1919
01:33:41,783 --> 01:33:42,716
m.j.!

1920
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:44,150
Aah!

1921
01:33:44,219 --> 01:33:45,185
M.j.!

1922
01:33:45,253 --> 01:33:46,853
I'm coming,
i'm coming!

1923
01:33:46,922 --> 01:33:48,521
Whoo! Yes!

1924
01:33:48,590 --> 01:33:50,023
1... 2... 3...

1925
01:33:50,092 --> 01:33:51,791
smile.

1926
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:53,860
Thank you!

1927
01:33:53,929 --> 01:33:55,028
Hey.

1928
01:33:55,097 --> 01:33:56,563
Want something to drink?

1929
01:33:56,632 --> 01:33:57,964
I'll have a little bubbly.

1930
01:33:58,033 --> 01:33:59,132
Whoo...

1931
01:33:59,201 --> 01:34:00,533
it's wonderful news
about frankie.

1932
01:34:00,602 --> 01:34:01,701
What are you
talking about?

1933
01:34:01,770 --> 01:34:03,703
Her job offer
in san francisco.

1934
01:34:03,772 --> 01:34:05,639
I think she should
take it.

1935
01:34:10,078 --> 01:34:11,745
Could you excuse us
for a second? Thanks.

1936
01:34:11,813 --> 01:34:13,780
Could i talk to you?

1937
01:34:17,219 --> 01:34:19,619
So what's this
about san francisco?

1938
01:34:20,789 --> 01:34:21,721
You heard.

1939
01:34:21,790 --> 01:34:22,922
Yeah. I--

1940
01:34:22,991 --> 01:34:24,624
i can't believe you haven't
said anything to me.

1941
01:34:24,693 --> 01:34:25,892
I mean, that's--

1942
01:34:25,961 --> 01:34:27,027
i was planning on
telling you tomorrow

1943
01:34:27,095 --> 01:34:28,161
when we had time
to discuss it.

1944
01:34:28,230 --> 01:34:30,397
I don't understand.

1945
01:34:30,465 --> 01:34:33,600
Frankie, are you...

1946
01:34:36,038 --> 01:34:37,804
do you love me?

1947
01:34:40,375 --> 01:34:41,307
Yes.

1948
01:34:41,376 --> 01:34:43,009
I really do.

1949
01:34:43,078 --> 01:34:45,412
Good, good. That's good.

1950
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:47,681
I--i mean...

1951
01:34:47,749 --> 01:34:49,315
it's good because
i've been thinking

1952
01:34:49,384 --> 01:34:51,251
about all these plans
for us.

1953
01:34:51,319 --> 01:34:53,787
I... i mean,
i kind of thought that

1954
01:34:53,855 --> 01:34:56,156
we would get married.

1955
01:34:58,994 --> 01:35:01,761
Do you want to marry me?

1956
01:35:01,830 --> 01:35:03,630
I mean...

1957
01:35:05,934 --> 01:35:08,201
will you marry me?

1958
01:35:11,006 --> 01:35:13,039
Yeah?

1959
01:35:13,108 --> 01:35:15,008
Yeah?

1960
01:35:17,579 --> 01:35:19,212
Ohh...

1961
01:35:23,185 --> 01:35:25,852
look at you.

1962
01:35:26,888 --> 01:35:28,655
You can open up
your eyes now.

1963
01:35:34,730 --> 01:35:37,030
I made this for you.

1964
01:35:37,933 --> 01:35:40,567
It's called <i>ride 'em, cowboy.</i>

1965
01:35:43,105 --> 01:35:44,771
Amanda, i love it.

1966
01:35:46,208 --> 01:35:48,141
Oh, god.

1967
01:35:48,210 --> 01:35:49,576
Oh...

1968
01:35:49,644 --> 01:35:51,077
i'm gonna miss you.

1969
01:35:51,146 --> 01:35:53,813
I'll come visit you.

1970
01:35:54,883 --> 01:35:56,483
Hey...

1971
01:35:56,551 --> 01:35:57,817
hey.

1972
01:35:57,886 --> 01:35:58,752
I like alex.

1973
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:01,054
He's great.

1974
01:36:01,123 --> 01:36:02,489
Yeah?
Yeah.

1975
01:36:02,557 --> 01:36:04,758
He is pretty cool.

1976
01:36:16,838 --> 01:36:20,240
It's like the two long-lost
brothers over here.

1977
01:36:20,308 --> 01:36:22,876
At least i'm leaving you
in good hands.

1978
01:36:22,944 --> 01:36:25,512
Oh, please.

1979
01:36:27,816 --> 01:36:29,349
This guy is so cool.

1980
01:36:29,417 --> 01:36:32,552
He says he's gonna get me
a tattoo.

1981
01:36:32,621 --> 01:36:34,120
No tattoos.

1982
01:36:34,189 --> 01:36:35,355
I can't wait.

1983
01:36:35,423 --> 01:36:36,356
First of all,
straighten up.

1984
01:36:36,424 --> 01:36:37,390
Straighten up.

1985
01:36:37,459 --> 01:36:38,858
Look, like there's--
like there's a string

1986
01:36:38,927 --> 01:36:39,826
coming from the ceiling.

1987
01:36:39,895 --> 01:36:41,194
From the sky.
That's right.

1988
01:36:41,263 --> 01:36:42,195
Straighten up.

1989
01:36:42,264 --> 01:36:43,129
Come on, will, ok?

1990
01:36:43,198 --> 01:36:45,465
You're very tense.

1991
01:36:46,401 --> 01:36:50,270
I want to dance
at your wedding.

1992
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:01,314
Can you believe
he asked me to marry him?

1993
01:37:01,383 --> 01:37:03,950
M.j., i'm so happy.

1994
01:37:17,365 --> 01:37:19,032
You want to dance, baby,
or what?

1995
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:21,100
Eew.

1996
01:37:21,169 --> 01:37:23,303
Later. Ok.

1997
01:37:31,646 --> 01:37:35,515
I've been doing
a lot of thinking lately.

1998
01:37:35,584 --> 01:37:38,284
Do you think it's possible
to find someone to love?

1999
01:37:40,121 --> 01:37:41,154
You're drunk,

2000
01:37:41,223 --> 01:37:42,822
and i don't want
to hear it.

2001
01:37:42,891 --> 01:37:46,626
No, it seems that
everybody's either

2002
01:37:46,695 --> 01:37:49,462
getting divorced
or fucking around these days.

2003
01:37:49,531 --> 01:37:51,931
Most of the couples
i know, they're miserable,

2004
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,367
trapped.

2005
01:37:54,436 --> 01:37:57,670
No. I think marriage
is doomed. I really do.

2006
01:37:57,739 --> 01:38:00,473
You know, you are
truly unbelievable.

2007
01:38:00,542 --> 01:38:02,542
I just asked frankie
to marry me

2008
01:38:02,611 --> 01:38:03,776
and now
you're out here

2009
01:38:03,845 --> 01:38:05,011
talking about
divorce.

2010
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:06,346
I'm not in the mood

2011
01:38:06,414 --> 01:38:08,181
for one of your
games tonight, m.j.

2012
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:09,849
no, taylor.

2013
01:38:09,918 --> 01:38:11,751
I'm not playing any games.

2014
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:14,420
I'm just confused.

2015
01:38:14,489 --> 01:38:17,423
I don't think i'll ever
find anyone to love.

2016
01:38:17,492 --> 01:38:19,025
I know
a hundred guys

2017
01:38:19,094 --> 01:38:20,059
that are in love
with you.

2018
01:38:20,128 --> 01:38:22,195
Soon as you decide
you want someone...

2019
01:38:22,264 --> 01:38:24,864
yeah, look what happened
the last time

2020
01:38:24,933 --> 01:38:26,466
i thought i found someone.

2021
01:38:26,534 --> 01:38:28,101
And even if i did
find someone,

2022
01:38:28,169 --> 01:38:29,802
how do i make it work?

2023
01:38:29,871 --> 01:38:31,471
How do i make it last?

2024
01:38:31,539 --> 01:38:33,373
Do you really think
it's possible

2025
01:38:33,441 --> 01:38:35,708
to be with one person
your whole life?

2026
01:38:35,777 --> 01:38:37,076
Do you?

2027
01:38:37,145 --> 01:38:39,212
Yeah.

2028
01:38:39,281 --> 01:38:40,947
What has it been,
2 months?

2029
01:38:41,016 --> 01:38:42,548
Let's give this guy
a medal!

2030
01:38:42,617 --> 01:38:44,751
Shut up!

2031
01:38:45,787 --> 01:38:48,688
And what happens
after you're married?

2032
01:38:48,757 --> 01:38:50,056
You go to a party,
and there,

2033
01:38:50,125 --> 01:38:52,225
sitting right there,
is the woman of your dreams.

2034
01:38:52,294 --> 01:38:55,128
Imagine never having sex
with anybody else,

2035
01:38:55,196 --> 01:38:57,597
never exploring a new body.

2036
01:38:57,666 --> 01:38:58,865
What do you do?

2037
01:38:58,934 --> 01:39:00,667
Do you suppress
those feelings?

2038
01:39:00,735 --> 01:39:02,902
I think you come
to realize

2039
01:39:02,971 --> 01:39:06,306
that such...
momentary satisfaction

2040
01:39:06,374 --> 01:39:08,341
doesn't outweigh

2041
01:39:08,410 --> 01:39:11,945
the pain you cause
in someone else.

2042
01:39:12,013 --> 01:39:14,180
Or your own guilt.

2043
01:39:16,184 --> 01:39:19,052
You can't suppress
those feelings, taylor.

2044
01:39:20,355 --> 01:39:22,288
You just don't
get it, do you?

2045
01:39:22,357 --> 01:39:23,456
There has been
nothing between

2046
01:39:23,525 --> 01:39:26,292
you and i
for months now.

2047
01:39:26,361 --> 01:39:28,995
At one point i thought
maybe i could love you

2048
01:39:29,064 --> 01:39:31,731
because behind
all of your bullshit,

2049
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:36,703
there really is this
warm, loveable woman.

2050
01:39:36,771 --> 01:39:39,372
And maybe it's possible
to love 2 people

2051
01:39:39,441 --> 01:39:41,641
at the same time...

2052
01:39:41,710 --> 01:39:43,643
i don't know,
but i made a decision.

2053
01:39:43,712 --> 01:39:44,978
And in the process,

2054
01:39:45,046 --> 01:39:46,279
i've fallen in love
with frankie,

2055
01:39:46,348 --> 01:39:48,281
and i'm gonna
marry her.

2056
01:39:49,384 --> 01:39:50,817
Oh.

2057
01:39:50,885 --> 01:39:53,219
Oh...

2058
01:39:53,288 --> 01:39:55,688
we had some good times,
didn't we, taylor?

2059
01:39:55,757 --> 01:39:57,323
No.

2060
01:39:58,660 --> 01:40:00,259
Yeah.

2061
01:40:01,529 --> 01:40:03,863
But it was
just sex, m.j.

2062
01:40:03,932 --> 01:40:05,398
i mean, i always
got the feeling

2063
01:40:05,467 --> 01:40:06,632
that you thought
being with me

2064
01:40:06,701 --> 01:40:09,002
meant mediocrity.

2065
01:40:09,070 --> 01:40:11,270
Why am i even
talking about this?

2066
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:12,472
I'm going back
inside.

2067
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:14,640
Everything's all fucked up!

2068
01:40:14,709 --> 01:40:17,143
God, why can't you just
be happy for us, huh?!

2069
01:40:17,212 --> 01:40:20,646
Is that so goddamn
hard for you?

2070
01:40:23,351 --> 01:40:25,151
It--

2071
01:40:25,220 --> 01:40:26,753
it really
doesn't matter.

2072
01:40:26,821 --> 01:40:29,255
It's all
over with now.

2073
01:40:29,324 --> 01:40:31,858
You know, the only times
i've ever felt safe

2074
01:40:31,926 --> 01:40:33,559
is when i'm having sex.

2075
01:40:33,628 --> 01:40:35,661
I felt that way
with you, you know.

2076
01:40:35,730 --> 01:40:38,297
Like i could block out
all the other shit,

2077
01:40:38,366 --> 01:40:42,268
and then he took
even that away from me!

2078
01:40:42,337 --> 01:40:44,771
You know how terrible
everyone felt

2079
01:40:44,839 --> 01:40:46,839
when that happened
to you.

2080
01:40:46,908 --> 01:40:48,975
Deep down inside,
i know how you guys felt,

2081
01:40:49,044 --> 01:40:51,110
that i brought
everything on me.

2082
01:40:52,180 --> 01:40:55,415
M.j., that's not true.

2083
01:40:58,219 --> 01:41:00,620
Sometimes i think...

2084
01:41:00,688 --> 01:41:02,488
that i really did
love you,

2085
01:41:02,557 --> 01:41:04,624
and that i still do.

2086
01:41:05,593 --> 01:41:07,326
What are you doin', huh?

2087
01:41:07,395 --> 01:41:09,362
I'm not gonna fall for this.

2088
01:41:09,431 --> 01:41:12,765
You don't really
want me, m.j.

2089
01:41:12,834 --> 01:41:16,102
you just want to know
you can have me.

2090
01:41:17,172 --> 01:41:19,539
Then why do i want
to kiss you so badly?

2091
01:41:23,078 --> 01:41:25,311
Ugh.

2092
01:41:30,952 --> 01:41:34,053
You think we should go
pry my brother

2093
01:41:34,122 --> 01:41:36,322
off that poor girl's face?

2094
01:41:38,059 --> 01:41:41,894
Ah! Where'd you get these?

2095
01:41:41,963 --> 01:41:43,496
Mmm.

2096
01:41:43,565 --> 01:41:44,931
I can't believe
you actually

2097
01:41:44,999 --> 01:41:47,066
eat these things.

2098
01:41:47,135 --> 01:41:49,368
Mmm, tasty.

2099
01:41:49,437 --> 01:41:51,304
Right?

2100
01:41:51,372 --> 01:41:52,638
Do you know many
muscles there are

2101
01:41:52,707 --> 01:41:54,407
in the trunk
of an elephant?

2102
01:41:54,476 --> 01:41:55,708
No.

2103
01:41:55,777 --> 01:41:57,677
100,000.

2104
01:41:57,745 --> 01:41:58,911
Liar!

2105
01:41:58,980 --> 01:42:00,880
On my mother's eye.

2106
01:42:00,949 --> 01:42:03,216
Oh.

2107
01:42:11,593 --> 01:42:13,993
<i>Merci, beaucoup.</i>

2108
01:42:14,996 --> 01:42:16,829
I love the way
you look

2109
01:42:16,898 --> 01:42:19,332
right before
i kiss you.

2110
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:21,834
Happy new year.

2111
01:42:37,051 --> 01:42:38,251
Ah!

2112
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:40,520
M.j.! God!
Why are you here?

2113
01:42:40,588 --> 01:42:41,787
I know you want it.

2114
01:42:41,856 --> 01:42:43,523
What does it take
to get through to you, huh?

2115
01:42:43,591 --> 01:42:44,557
Come on!

2116
01:42:44,626 --> 01:42:46,826
M.j., don't do this.
Please don't do this.

2117
01:42:48,496 --> 01:42:51,097
Excuse me.
Has anyone seen taylor?

2118
01:42:51,166 --> 01:42:53,332
It's almost
midnight, right?

2119
01:42:53,401 --> 01:42:56,135
Yeah, no. No, i haven't
seen him lately.

2120
01:42:56,204 --> 01:42:57,670
Oh.

2121
01:42:59,007 --> 01:43:01,073
Ok, everybody,
it's almost midnight!

2122
01:43:01,142 --> 01:43:03,276
Ready?!

2123
01:43:03,344 --> 01:43:06,812
10, 9, 8,

2124
01:43:06,881 --> 01:43:09,582
7, 6,

2125
01:43:09,651 --> 01:43:11,884
5, 4,

2126
01:43:11,953 --> 01:43:13,352
3, 2--

2127
01:43:13,421 --> 01:43:14,787
come on.
One!

2128
01:43:17,559 --> 01:43:19,258
Oh, my god!

2129
01:43:20,461 --> 01:43:21,827
Oh, shit!

2130
01:43:21,896 --> 01:43:23,062
Frankie, wait, wait!

2131
01:43:23,131 --> 01:43:24,463
Frankie, please!

2132
01:43:24,532 --> 01:43:26,165
What's going on here?

2133
01:43:26,234 --> 01:43:28,568
Frankie!

2134
01:43:28,636 --> 01:43:30,703
Frankie!

2135
01:43:33,408 --> 01:43:35,007
You know what, amanda,
i'm really sick of you!

2136
01:43:35,076 --> 01:43:36,809
Well, fine! Be sick!
I don't give a shit!

2137
01:43:36,878 --> 01:43:38,411
You guys, you guys,
i'm sick of both of you.

2138
01:43:38,479 --> 01:43:40,446
Please? My plane leaves
in 4 hours.

2139
01:43:40,515 --> 01:43:41,847
Can't we just...

2140
01:43:41,916 --> 01:43:43,216
pretend to get along
for a little while?

2141
01:43:43,284 --> 01:43:45,585
Taylor, what happened?
Did you guys find her?

2142
01:43:45,653 --> 01:43:47,453
Talk to me! Hello!

2143
01:43:47,522 --> 01:43:49,021
Taylor!

2144
01:43:49,090 --> 01:43:51,624
No, we didn't
find her anywhere.

2145
01:43:51,693 --> 01:43:52,925
This is really
not good.

2146
01:43:52,994 --> 01:43:54,260
No, this is
really fucked up.

2147
01:43:54,329 --> 01:43:55,528
But, you know,
you really

2148
01:43:55,597 --> 01:43:56,829
can't blame the girl
for not wanting to be here.

2149
01:43:56,898 --> 01:43:58,231
Boy, that really
helps, amanda.

2150
01:43:58,299 --> 01:43:59,232
That really helps,

2151
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:00,299
especially
coming from you

2152
01:44:00,368 --> 01:44:01,567
sitting on your ass.

2153
01:44:01,636 --> 01:44:02,768
Oh, fuck you!

2154
01:44:02,837 --> 01:44:04,437
She's out there
all alone!

2155
01:44:04,505 --> 01:44:05,805
She is all alone!

2156
01:44:08,977 --> 01:44:12,111
Frankie, frankie
will be here

2157
01:44:12,180 --> 01:44:15,248
when she'll be here.

2158
01:44:15,316 --> 01:44:16,816
Now, i think
we should all

2159
01:44:16,884 --> 01:44:18,384
just take a look
at the anxiety

2160
01:44:18,453 --> 01:44:21,087
flying around
this room.

2161
01:44:21,155 --> 01:44:23,256
Darling?
Yes?

2162
01:44:23,324 --> 01:44:24,390
I'm gonna
go upstairs

2163
01:44:24,459 --> 01:44:26,425
and have a relax.
You wanna come?

2164
01:44:27,562 --> 01:44:29,362
No.

2165
01:44:41,409 --> 01:44:43,309
Frankie...

2166
01:44:43,378 --> 01:44:45,044
frankie, let me explain.

2167
01:44:45,113 --> 01:44:46,512
There's nothing
to say.

2168
01:44:46,581 --> 01:44:47,747
No, just listen to me.

2169
01:44:47,815 --> 01:44:48,781
Get your hands
off of me.

2170
01:44:48,850 --> 01:44:49,815
No.

2171
01:44:49,884 --> 01:44:50,816
Get your hands
off of me!

2172
01:44:50,885 --> 01:44:52,151
No! Not until you--

2173
01:44:52,220 --> 01:44:54,887
get your fuckin'
hands off of me!

2174
01:44:54,956 --> 01:44:56,789
Ow! You're
hurting me!

2175
01:45:00,161 --> 01:45:03,763
All right, i just want
to explain to you what--

2176
01:45:03,831 --> 01:45:05,097
aah!

2177
01:45:06,601 --> 01:45:09,168
Have you ever thought
about anyone else

2178
01:45:09,237 --> 01:45:11,070
beside yourself?

2179
01:45:13,474 --> 01:45:14,607
God, for all
these years,

2180
01:45:14,676 --> 01:45:17,576
i have put up with
so much bullshit!

2181
01:45:18,846 --> 01:45:21,347
I'm such an idiot.

2182
01:45:21,416 --> 01:45:24,517
Ok, m.j., now you're gonna
tell her what happened.

2183
01:45:24,585 --> 01:45:26,919
God damn it, you tell her
what i said to you

2184
01:45:26,988 --> 01:45:28,954
in that room now!

2185
01:45:29,991 --> 01:45:31,991
He, um...

2186
01:45:33,194 --> 01:45:37,663
he told me that--
that he didn't love me.

2187
01:45:37,732 --> 01:45:40,032
That he loved you.

2188
01:45:40,101 --> 01:45:41,567
I was the one
that climbed

2189
01:45:41,636 --> 01:45:44,070
into bed with him.

2190
01:45:44,138 --> 01:45:45,905
I wasn't invited.

2191
01:45:46,841 --> 01:45:50,276
And it--it never
happened before?

2192
01:45:55,550 --> 01:45:57,116
Oh, god!

2193
01:45:57,185 --> 01:45:59,618
Oh, god, you both
are so fucked up!

2194
01:45:59,687 --> 01:46:01,487
You really
deserve each other.

2195
01:46:01,556 --> 01:46:04,056
I--i need help!

2196
01:46:04,125 --> 01:46:06,125
Please!

2197
01:46:07,195 --> 01:46:10,162
I need you.

2198
01:46:10,231 --> 01:46:12,498
I used to think
that was important,

2199
01:46:12,567 --> 01:46:13,733
that people needed me.

2200
01:46:13,801 --> 01:46:16,769
And look what i have
to show for it.

2201
01:46:19,107 --> 01:46:21,707
I'm moving out
of this house.

2202
01:46:21,776 --> 01:46:23,342
You can't go
to san francisco.

2203
01:46:23,411 --> 01:46:25,945
Come on, we can
work this out.

2204
01:46:27,982 --> 01:46:29,715
Please.

2205
01:46:30,818 --> 01:46:33,819
I'm not leaving l.a.
i belong here.

2206
01:46:33,888 --> 01:46:35,488
But you are getting
the fuck out of this house

2207
01:46:35,556 --> 01:46:37,456
right now.

2208
01:46:55,543 --> 01:46:57,410
I have to go.

2209
01:46:57,478 --> 01:46:59,044
Ok.

2210
01:47:01,516 --> 01:47:03,349
Well, anybody hungry?

2211
01:47:03,418 --> 01:47:05,584
Definitely, dude.
Let's get out of here!

2212
01:47:05,653 --> 01:47:08,154
I mean, everybody's acting
like somebody died.

2213
01:47:08,222 --> 01:47:10,156
This is new years day.

2214
01:47:10,224 --> 01:47:12,725
That means cheesy parades,
bloody marys,

2215
01:47:12,794 --> 01:47:14,193
football.

2216
01:47:14,262 --> 01:47:15,728
Breakfast is on me.

2217
01:47:15,797 --> 01:47:17,463
Oh, where'd
you get this?

2218
01:47:17,532 --> 01:47:19,632
Um, minx, now that you
have 2 rooms open,

2219
01:47:19,700 --> 01:47:21,066
you're definitely
gonna need a roommate.

2220
01:47:21,135 --> 01:47:22,301
Willie's there's not
going to be

2221
01:47:22,370 --> 01:47:24,069
anybody living here
after a while.

2222
01:47:24,138 --> 01:47:25,805
I love you.

2223
01:47:25,873 --> 01:47:27,039
I love you.

2224
01:47:27,108 --> 01:47:28,707
I'm gonna
miss you.

2225
01:47:30,311 --> 01:47:32,578
Who's gonna take me
to the airport?

2226
01:47:32,647 --> 01:47:34,747
Mmm.

2227
01:47:34,816 --> 01:47:36,048
