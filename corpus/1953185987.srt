1
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,760
Wait!

2
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,440
Somebody told me,
love is like waiting for a bus.

3
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,520
The one that arrives isn't
the one you expected.

4
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,400
And when the one
you expected arrives,

5
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,280
there will be obstacles blocking
the way to get on it.

6
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,360
This happens all the time.

7
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,040
I've had a crush on Ohm
since elementary school.

8
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,160
This love seems impossible,

9
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,400
but I still had hope,

10
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,360
no matter how many years pass by.

11
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,920
However, our story finally ended,

12
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,920
because Ohm went out with Pam.

13
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,840
They decided to study abroad together.

14
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,400
But my life has to go on.

15
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,160
I later moved to study in Bangkok,

16
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,120
Hoping that I could fall in love
with someone.

17
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,680
But I don't have any feeling toward any.

18
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,080
Maybe,

19
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,040
I'm still waiting for Ohm.

20
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,240
Jane

21
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,640
Jane

22
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,720
Get out of your meditation.
Our shop is crowded.

23
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,800
What's going on, you two creatures?

24
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,720
While you were meditating,

25
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,200
did you see that

26
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,320
the executive presiding
at the party tonight

27
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,400
is damn...

28
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,400
hot.

29
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,080
Stop it.

30
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,960
I'm in hibernate mode,

31
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,680
on "male" diet.

32
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,400
Here he comes.

33
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,160
He's cool!

34
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,280
Ohm.

35
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,600
I know this is ridiculous,

36
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,080
but it's not anymore.

37
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,400
Now, he comes back to my life again.

38
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,040
I've never imagined this moment before,

39
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,440
but now it's real.

40
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,720
Sa, right?

41
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,680
I thought you still live in London.

42
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,800
After I finished BA from Harvard.

43
00:05:12,835 --> 00:05:15,800
I went for MA at Oxford.

44
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,480
Then I came back to Thailand

45
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,880
Urgent,

46
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,520
- and...
- And you're alone?

47
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Yes. I'm alone.

48
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,680
I've just come back and
too busy to make new friend.

49
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,360
I just arrived.

50
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,000
Can I have your number?

51
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,400
If love is like waiting for a bus

52
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,280
I think it's worth every minute.

53
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,440
It may takes years,

54
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,240
but my bus arrives now.

55
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,040
I'll get on this bus and begin my journey.

56
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,600
"First Kiss"

57
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,400
Focus on your work,
I'll call you later.

58
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,640
Yes.

59
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,120
Bye-bye.

60
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,720
There is dog hair on your shirt.

61
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,320
I told you this dog is losing hair
and you still wanted to hold it.

62
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,400
Where?

63
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,240
Over there.

64
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,520
Let me help.

65
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,920
Kiss?

66
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,520
Concentrate on your work.

67
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'll give you a call.

68
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,440
Go to work.

69
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,760
When he dropped you off,

70
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,720
I saw everything.

71
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,000
Guilty as charged!

72
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,000
Bitch! Slut!
You seduced him.

73
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:24,520
True.

74
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:25,680
But I like it.

75
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:26,400
You slutty!

76
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,120
You know first kiss is very important.

77
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,760
It foresees the future
between you and your lover.

78
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,000
I broke up with my ex-boyfriend
because of the first kiss.

79
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,800
His tongue is so big

80
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,360
When I pressed my lips with his,

81
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,600
his saliva was all over my mouth.

82
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,880
It made me feels like
kissing a bulldog.

83
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,560
The point is if your first kiss is good,

84
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,960
it's possible that
your relation would went well.

85
00:09:12,995 --> 00:09:13,920
That's right.

86
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,080
Good luck.

87
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,720
Let's go to work.

88
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,800
I'm glad you're with me here
at Phu Thab Berg.

89
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,720
I'd love to be with you anywhere.

90
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,360
Sa...

91
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,040
I love you.

92
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,600
Accident!

93
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,160
I gave a signal.
Don't you see?

94
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,920
You ruined my Phu Thab Berg.

95
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,640
What Phu Thab Berg, auntie?

96
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,040
What's wrong with you?

97
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,840
Pull over, I'll get off here.

98
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,840
We need to talk.

99
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,320
You punk.
Hope I never see your face again, psycho!

100
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,280
Stop, please!
I'll get off this stop.

101
00:10:45,315 --> 00:10:48,120
No passenger allow to leave
outside bus stop, auntie.

102
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,720
What did you...?!

103
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,960
What did you call me?
A psycho?

104
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,960
Do I really look psycho to you?

105
00:10:58,995 --> 00:10:59,880
You are the one who...

106
00:10:59,915 --> 00:11:02,680
Hey, stop it!

107
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,560
Shut up, you punk!

108
00:11:05,595 --> 00:11:06,760
...Kiss me.

109
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,880
I didn't intend to kiss you.
I'm sorry.

110
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,040
You didn't intend to?
Then, why do you say sorry?

111
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,000
I don't know.

112
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,120
OK. That's s my bad.

113
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,800
But I didn't intend to do that.

114
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,320
I did nothing.

115
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,200
Nothing?
Obviously, you kissed me.

116
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,320
Quiet!

117
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,680
We did have a kiss.

118
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,520
What else could I say?

119
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,040
You kissed me.
Kissed me. Kissed...

120
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,520
Hi.

121
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,600
Excuse me.
Did you have my cell phone?

122
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,840
Well...

123
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,160
Why did you kiss me?

124
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,880
Why did you steal my phone?

125
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,600
Why did you steal my cell phone,
you rascal?

126
00:13:07,635 --> 00:13:10,600
You threw it to me, remember?

127
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,320
And then you ran away.

128
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,640
How could I give it back to you?

129
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,560
Whatever.

130
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,000
You better give it back to me now.

131
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,800
No!

132
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,120
You can't keep it.
It's mine!

133
00:13:26,155 --> 00:13:29,880
Yes, I can.
I'll keep it as a compensation,

134
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,160
for you stole kiss me.

135
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,200
You have to pay me a lot more,
if there were any compensation.

136
00:13:41,235 --> 00:13:43,000
Because you stole my first kiss.

137
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,720
What?

138
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,480
Am I really your first kiss?

139
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,360
How old are you?

140
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,000
You asshole.

141
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,920
If you won't give my phone back,

142
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,640
I'll meet you at you school and we'll see!

143
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Anytime.

144
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,640
If you can find out where I study,
then, see me there.

145
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,520
Paramee with whatever surnames,

146
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,560
Please come to the disciplinary office.

147
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,200
Paramee with whatever surnames,

148
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,080
Please come to the disciplinary office.

149
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,000
What did you do?

150
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,680
Trouble.

151
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,920
Paramee Jindanin

152
00:14:45,955 --> 00:14:47,280
Paramee Yiam ngamkul

153
00:14:47,315 --> 00:14:48,600
Paramee Un Ruean

154
00:14:48,635 --> 00:14:49,880
Paramee Opanunt

155
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,960
What am I doing wrong?

156
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,920
I've never been to the disciplinary office.

157
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,120
I always submit my homework.

158
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,160
What are you mourning for?

159
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,000
Huh?

160
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,200
That's him!

161
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,120
Paramee...

162
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,440
Do you steal her cell phone?

163
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,800
Yes, ma'am.

164
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,600
I caught him but
he refused to give it back.

165
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
Why did you do that?

166
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,600
Indeed.

167
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,840
I can't believe this kid dare stealing.

168
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,880
You must give her phone back now.

169
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,320
I got to say sorry for my student.

170
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,560
Never mind.

171
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,040
Paramee, for what you have done,

172
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,720
you have to be punished.

173
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,560
Come here.

174
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:53,120
Ma'am.
I don't think you have to do this.

175
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,160
I already get my phone back.
Everything's intact.

176
00:16:56,195 --> 00:16:56,960
No.

177
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,720
He should be punished
for what he has done

178
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,040
So he won't do it again.

179
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,680
Well...

180
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,600
Just sit and still hurt?

181
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,440
Haven't you been punished
when you were young?

182
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,720
Oh... you can't remember, right

183
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,600
because it's a long long time ago.

184
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,200
Cut it off!
I'm not that old.

185
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,720
Here.

186
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,800
What is it?
Herbal drug for old maid?

187
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,400
You dog breath!

188
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,080
Use it.

189
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,040
Auntie, how do you know my name?

190
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,280
and where I study?

191
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,160
Do you think I'm blind?

192
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,960
I just couldn't catch your last name.

193
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
By the way, stop calling me auntie!

194
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,000
Then, what do you want me to call?

195
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,720
Call me sister Sa.

196
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,680
Why I have to call you sister?

197
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,720
Can I call you Miss Sa?

198
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,760
No!
Call me sister.

199
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,360
I don't want to.

200
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,080
Between auntie Sa and Miss Sa,

201
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,520
what do you prefer?

202
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,880
All right! Miss Sa then!

203
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,480
- You're unbelievable, stupido!
- Bass.

204
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,520
My name is Bass.

205
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,120
Hello, Ohm.

206
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,320
Tomorrow?

207
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,560
I'm available.

208
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,280
The Chinese restaurant on Sukhumvit?

209
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,000
Yes, I remember that place.

210
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,160
What are you doing here?

211
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,240
What a small world?

212
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,760
Are you sure?

213
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,640
Such a coincidence.

214
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,440
I'll come and get it. Punk!

215
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,960
Yes,

216
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,400
I'll take care of it.

217
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,760
Thank you.

218
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,480
Sorry. It was my customer calling.

219
00:20:19,515 --> 00:20:21,720
What is this, Bass?
Why this restaurant?

220
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,240
Don't you think it's too old?

221
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,360
But I think it fits your face.

222
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,240
How is it?

223
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,240
Why you call us to this restaurant?

224
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,880
I want to celebrate.

225
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,120
I've just realized that luck is on my side.

226
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,320
Peanut tastes great
if you pick it with love.

227
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,440
Thank you very much.

228
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,800
Sa...

229
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,680
I'm so glad that we've met again.

230
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,520
Garland?

231
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,920
Do you want it or not?

232
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,280
I think you should go to your room.

233
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,080
And I'll call you later.

234
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,400
All right.

235
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,520
- Thanks, Ohm.
- Yes.

236
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,080
Hey!
Garland, ma'am?

237
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,400
It's you?

238
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,440
Why you keep getting on my nerve?!

239
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,920
- How much do you want?!
- Stop!

240
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,560
Someone like me money can't buy.

241
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,240
So, what do you want?

242
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,840
Tomorrow, meet me here at ten.

243
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,360
and dress beautifully.

244
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,840
You'll go to the cinema with me because...

245
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,680
Are you crazy?

246
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,080
What kind of dress?

247
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,320
I said dress beautifully, didn't I?

248
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,160
This is the best I can.

249
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,600
The best dress for dating with you.

250
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,480
Look at that!
He's so cute.

251
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,520
Is he with his mom?

252
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,000
No way.
They don't look alike.

253
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,880
I don't think they're relative.

254
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,800
What do you think?
His girlfriend?

255
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,920
Gosh!
I'm sure she is his mother.

256
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,600
- They might have been Art & Craft Center.
- I guess.

257
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,920
That's why I told you to dress properly.

258
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,640
Do you want to change?

259
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,560
You'd better dress appropriate next time.

260
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,240
Next time? There is no next time.
This is the only last time with you.

261
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,120
- So cute!
- Shouldn't have come with his mom.

262
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,640
What? What are you doing, huh?

263
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,280
I want to show you the trailer
before we enter a theatre.

264
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,960
Wait, darling.

265
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,160
- This is better?
- Well, yes, it looks all right.

266
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,240
- Let me help.
- Let's go.

267
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,480
Pam?

268
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,480
What's wrong?

269
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,320
Nothing

270
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,640
I know Pam.

271
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,800
I see you date with her boyfriend,

272
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,480
So I brought you here to see it by yourself.

273
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,120
They are getting married.

274
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,560
Married?

275
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,160
Ohm is getting married?
I can't believe.

276
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,000
He seems really love you, Sa.

277
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,680
Have you talked to him?

278
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,480
Someone brings you this, Sa.

279
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,200
Who sent it?
Damn cheesy.

280
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,240
It's me.

281
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,080
Who are you?

282
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,200
- Go to lunch with me?
- Yes, sure!

283
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,480
Follow me.

284
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,040
Hey!

285
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,360
Make sure that
they won't catch you, all right?

286
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,560
You sneaky...

287
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,480
Bitch

288
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,080
I've just seen you cry for Ohm,

289
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,240
in a blink,

290
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,560
you get a new one.

291
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,800
- Food will be served at your table.
- Thank you.

292
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,320
- Evil!
- Slut!

293
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,240
Devil!

294
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,320
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

295
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,160
Lady first.

296
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,720
Here you are.

297
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,280
Strong coffee.

298
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,560
Hey, you!

299
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,240
Why don't you introduce your friends?

300
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,200
This is Jane and Mham.

301
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,800
- Hello.
- Good to see you.

302
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,200
My colleagues

303
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,000
This is Bass.

304
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,360
Bass?

305
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,840
He is just a friend.
See him nearby.

306
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,280
Why didn't I discover him first?

307
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,360
- You're Bass?
- Yes.

308
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,000
Can I play?

309
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,320
Well, yes.

310
00:28:04,355 --> 00:28:05,640
Stop it.

311
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,680
Excuse me.

312
00:28:09,715 --> 00:28:12,800
Give it to me. Over here.
Big wings indeed.

313
00:28:12,835 --> 00:28:13,800
Cock-a-hoop.

314
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,360
- Let's eat!
- Thank you.

315
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,480
Thank you.

316
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,320
Please.

317
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,720
I want some.

318
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,160
Wicked!
He doesn't let her pick up the phone.

319
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,360
Great!

320
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,320
Don't even let her read his message.

321
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,080
Can I ask?
Is that my phone?

322
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,840
What are you doing?

323
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,680
Nothing.

324
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,920
It's not necessary to get that.
It's nonsense.

325
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,160
Was that Ohm?

326
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,880
She really makes me envy.

327
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,200
Why nobody fight for me?

328
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,840
Look at you face...

329
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,680
and decide why men would fight for you?

330
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,120
Just ignore it.
Finish your food, okay?

331
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,320
I got to go now.

332
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,760
Have something to do.

333
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,720
Hey!
My cell phone is with him.

334
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,240
Yes.

335
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,120
He's gone.

336
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,200
Don't act innocent,

337
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,200
I know you lure him.

338
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,000
So deep.

339
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,280
Her scheme.

340
00:29:48,315 --> 00:29:49,840
Out of my league.

341
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,040
They are just girls.
I'll hit on a woman like Khru Dao.

342
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,280
Who is she?

343
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,960
A new intern teacher.

344
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,080
She resembles my mom.
That's my type.

345
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,920
How come are you here?

346
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,080
Hello. I'm Sa.
I'm a senior in high school.

347
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,880
Oh I mean grade 12/4

348
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,080
What did you say?
Senior?

349
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,920
Se.. Se.. See you there!

350
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,200
Is she study at our school?

351
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,560
She doesn't look familiar.

352
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,480
She looks too old.

353
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,520
Look who's talking.

354
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,920
I've nurtured my skin
since I was a kid.

355
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,040
Damn!

356
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,480
By the way,
I'm not familiar with her.

357
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,120
How can you familiar?

358
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,640
She's not studying in our school.

359
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,360
Actually, she's already got a job.

360
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,240
But I'm hitting on her.

361
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,720
That's why she follows me here.

362
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,040
You the man.

363
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,120
See?
She's shy.

364
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,240
You pretty face boy!

365
00:31:47,275 --> 00:31:50,600
Anyway, let me introduce,

366
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,400
Here is Sa.

367
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,720
This is Win and Art, my friends.

368
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,760
Hello.

369
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,360
Is he your uncle?
Why is he here?

370
00:32:04,395 --> 00:32:06,240
Does he help you steal things?

371
00:32:06,275 --> 00:32:07,280
How long have you been here?

372
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,920
What?
What long?

373
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,400
Pre-class assembly!
Go! Hurry!

374
00:32:13,435 --> 00:32:15,280
- Yes.
- Hurry.

375
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,280
Run!

376
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,080
Hey!
Get it back to me.

377
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,560
Don't be so hurry.

378
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,680
Since you are here,

379
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,960
Let's have some fun.

380
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,480
Back in high school,
have you ever broken school's rule?

381
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,440
Do you want to try?

382
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,720
Well...

383
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,960
Let's start from bulling you.

384
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,040
All right!
Let see then.

385
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,760
Sa... I'm sorry.

386
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,760
You... die!

387
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,000
Why did you hit me?

388
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,960
Have you ever skipped class?

389
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,120
What are you two doing?

390
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,560
Why don't you go to class?

391
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,160
Where you think you're going?

392
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,200
This way!
This way!

393
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,680
Where are you going?

394
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,040
I loved to spend time

395
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,840
in science lab during free class.

396
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,600
Why?

397
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,800
I don't think
it's a good place for relax.

398
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,640
- You're not afraid now?
- Acting.

399
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:52,240
Where do you love to go
when you skip class?

400
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,640
Mostly, I spent my time at music room.

401
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,640
Practicing with my band.

402
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,680
I don't want to brag,

403
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,840
but I'm a member of school band.

404
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,600
Are there any band's fans?

405
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,320
No, I just play for fun.

406
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,080
Is that what you want to hear?

407
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:21,680
Oh... poor little boy.

408
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,400
If there's no one listen
to your song, tell me

409
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,920
I'll go listen to it.

410
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,360
Really?

411
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,360
Oh, by the way...

412
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,240
you haven't told me
why you liked a science lab

413
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,200
I loved a science lab...

414
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,880
because at my school,

415
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,000
if you looked down from the lab's window,

416
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,080
you saw the whole basketball court clearly.

417
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,720
Paramee!

418
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,600
Don't let me catch you.

419
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,640
Are you hiding?

420
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,080
You hiding from me?

421
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,120
Where are they?

422
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,600
Let's go!

423
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,080
Paramee, don't let me catch you!

424
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,680
Should be somewhere in there.

425
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,440
Your wallet...

426
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,600
you better look for it yourself.
I'll wait here.

427
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:43,920
Hey, wait.
Will you come with me?

428
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,400
No, I won't.

429
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,120
You go find it by yourself.

430
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,080
Here.

431
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,280
No matter what happens, don't call me.

432
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,680
At this moment you better call an exorcist.

433
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,240
Did you find it?

434
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,160
If you want me to find it quickly,
come and help.

435
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,920
I thought you said you like science lab.

436
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,960
I like watching view from my science lab,

437
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,760
not here.

438
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,880
Don't you want to know

439
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,000
looking from this lab's window,

440
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,000
what will you see?

441
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,040
Would you love me
if you don't have anyone?

442
00:40:32,075 --> 00:40:35,920
Please open your heart for me

443
00:40:35,955 --> 00:40:44,120
I promise you with my life that
I won't let you down

444
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,080
Would you love me, please?

445
00:40:49,115 --> 00:40:53,480
I don't want to see anyone have you.

446
00:40:53,515 --> 00:41:01,160
How do I live without you beside me?

447
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,280
I don't want to compare myself with Ohm.

448
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,160
I just want you to forget him.

449
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,080
Is that it?

450
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,080
I want to be your boyfriend.

451
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,880
I just want a chance to take care of you.

452
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,960
Friend can take care of friend.

453
00:42:29,995 --> 00:42:31,320
I don't want to be just friend.

454
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,200
Have I told you love is
like waiting for a bus?

455
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,120
I've found that...

456
00:43:23,155 --> 00:43:24,880
it's not just about waiting.

457
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,080
Also, I've learned that,

458
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,440
once the bus arrives,

459
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,800
you have to decide if you get on it.

460
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,800
You looks very blossom
since you were in love.

461
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,320
Putting on makeup,

462
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,080
do you want to compete
the beauty with me?

463
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,720
She can't.
You are way ahead of.

464
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,760
- Who is it?
- Ohm.

465
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,240
Give me.

466
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,360
Don't talk to him.

467
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,800
Coffee, ma'am.

468
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,480
Here it is!

469
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,080
"Love you"

470
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,480
"Tutorial School"

471
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,960
Drop off your younger brother?
That's sweet.

472
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,200
Would you love me, please?

473
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,520
He forgets to bring his wallet.

474
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,920
Ouch!
My eyelash!

475
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,320
"Love me?"

476
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,960
Sa... You old crone.

477
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,760
I know everything now.

478
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,280
Bass's friend is my face book’s friend.

479
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,480
I thought it's his old photo.

480
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,560
Bass?

481
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,560
Are you serious with this relation?

482
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,040
Well.
He's good in everything.

483
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:39,720
What important is you two like him.

484
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,120
No high school boy would
take any love seriously.

485
00:46:48,155 --> 00:46:49,520
This is serious.

486
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,480
Though you don't care anything,

487
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,360
at least you think about moral.

488
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,760
We're 26.
We should think about marriage.

489
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,520
It takes many years
before your boyfriend graduates.

490
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,440
Don't you think
he might meet a younger,

491
00:47:04,475 --> 00:47:06,440
and prettier woman than you.

492
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,560
It might takes 10 years
before he's ready for marriage.

493
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,920
And 10 years from now,

494
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,800
you womb might be
dysfunctional by then.

495
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,720
Come on. Let me help.

496
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,000
Fine, if you don't need my help.

497
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,840
Now my friends know that
you are high school boy.

498
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,760
So?

499
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,080
They told me that,

500
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,400
I should have thought more
about future and reality.

501
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,080
What do you mean?

502
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,040
Our age gap is too wide.

503
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,600
We think differently.

504
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:12,600
How do we feel to each other,
I don't think

505
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,960
it's enough to carry our relationship.

506
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,920
Since you might not even,
think about our future.

507
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,040
I guess we could make it together.

508
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,480
I've thought about our future for a while.

509
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,320
Our future is,

510
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:41,800
when I graduate,
I will take over my dad's business.

511
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,320
Then we'll getting married.

512
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,360
We'll have two children.

513
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,400
By that time, I will be 28.

514
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,800
You will be 36.

515
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,040
But nobody will care about that
when the time's comes.

516
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,400
Sa.

517
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,840
Do you know, in my life,

518
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,920
I've chosen everything by myself.

519
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,560
It's just a few thing that I couldn't.

520
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,800
I couldn't choose my birthday.

521
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,840
But now I've chosen that,

522
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,200
for the rest of my life,

523
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,720
I will be with you forever.

524
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:51,720
Every morning, before I go to work,

525
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,000
I want you to tie a tie for me.

526
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,320
Why you crying?

527
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,760
You don't like my planned future.

528
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,840
Hey, Sa...

529
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,720
Do you want to come in
and wash your face?

530
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,840
Come on.

531
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,440
Come.

532
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:52,920
Stop!

533
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,040
What are you doing?

534
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:58,480
- Want me to hit his head? Let go of me!
- Stop!

535
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,000
Sa... this is my father.

536
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,680
Hello, sir.
I'm sorry...

537
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,880
for that extreme greeting.

538
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,760
Who is this woman?

539
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:27,800
She's my friend.

540
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,520
Look all you have done!

541
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,920
Someone called me
you went to practice with your band.

542
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,200
Did I order you not to play music?

543
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,080
You should stop misbehave
and hang out late.

544
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,320
I won't live forever to teach you.

545
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,720
- Go upstairs!
- I will but let me send my friend back home first.

546
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,720
I'm all right.

547
00:52:11,755 --> 00:52:13,640
By the way, you were great.

548
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,880
If nobody had stopped you,

549
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,680
my father should have been knocked down.

550
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,200
Come on, let's go home.

551
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,680
And don't bother to give me a ride back.

552
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,640
Wait a minute.

553
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,560
Don't tell me that your...?

554
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:49,160
No need.

555
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,000
I'll get some more when I go back.

556
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,760
I'm going to do it once at a time.

557
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:01,000
Why did your dad do this to you?

558
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,680
He always mad at me since my mom died.

559
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,440
Every activities I can do
when my mom's alive,

560
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,840
I couldn't do any now.

561
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,520
My dad only wants me to stay home.

562
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,520
But while I was there,

563
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,280
he always be with another woman.

564
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,040
That's why I go out
and practice music with my band

565
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:27,360
Somebody had asked
my band to play in the pub.

566
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,000
Can you?
I think you are underage for such place.

567
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,160
Well...

568
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,800
What about your dad?

569
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,600
Age is not a problem.

570
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,280
But my dad...

571
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,640
Forget it.
For him, I always do things wrong.

572
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,560
I have to go.

573
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,680
He has been waiting for too long.

574
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,480
Bass!

575
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,480
Nice place.

576
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,160
Who are they?!

577
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,920
My brothers.

578
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,680
Tle and Tik,

579
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,200
The turbulence twin.

580
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:17,280
They do nothing but arguing
who was born before.

581
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:21,960
Sit here.

582
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,520
I'll give you bandage.

583
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,440
Live by yourself, aren't you feel lonely?

584
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,440
How can you go to school in this condition?

585
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,440
I think you'd better rest here.

586
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,440
If you are hungry,

587
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,640
there are foods in the fridge.

588
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,320
And in the evening,

589
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,720
I'll cook for you.

590
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,480
Here.

591
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,640
Is it good?

592
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,880
Do you want a lie or a truth?

593
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:00,920
Listen...

594
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,000
You ran away from home like this.
Where will you stay?

595
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,440
Can I stay here?

596
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,880
Please... just for a while.

597
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,360
I'll move out when
I can find a new place.

598
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,120
- Please, please, please.
- All right.

599
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,080
Then...

600
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,040
Go take a shower,

601
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,040
I'll prepare the bed for you.

602
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:58,720
Hey, go to bed.

603
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:02,160
- You have to go to school tomorrow.
- I haven't done my homework yet.

604
01:00:02,195 --> 01:00:02,880
What?

605
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,880
Pervert!

606
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,400
What's pervert?

607
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:12,200
I meant homework as a school assignment.

608
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,080
What do you think it is?

609
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:17,880
Well.. homework as it is.

610
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,560
All right. Forget it.

611
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,400
Come on. What subject?
Let me help.

612
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,200
What is that?

613
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,280
Not so smart now?

614
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:49,880
It's the 'Diff'

615
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:51,640
Diff?

616
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:53,960
What's Diff?

617
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,440
Is it like 'Dib Boy scout' the singer?

618
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,040
Who's he?

619
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,640
It's Diff Integration.

620
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,400
It's Calculus.
It goes like this.

621
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:13,920
Get it?

622
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,600
How could you be this stupid?

623
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,800
I studied language arts, not maths.

624
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,160
Don't make an excuse.

625
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,440
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

626
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:32,120
You're just a kid!
Show me some respect!

627
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:37,000
How could you mess up my head?

628
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,800
You should go sleep in your bed.

629
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,040
What key did you give to the boy?

630
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,640
My room's key

631
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,880
You did it with the boy, didn't you?

632
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,480
You're now immortal!

633
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,280
Are you nuts? Huh?

634
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,840
He's running away from home.

635
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,400
You invite him to stay with you?

636
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,480
You're such a big bad bitch!

637
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,920
You're ruining his future.

638
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,680
Nonsense!
I'm not ruining his future.

639
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:21,680
We are actually planning
our future together.

640
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:23,960
When he graduates..

641
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,600
He'll take over the family business

642
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,960
Then, we'll get married.

643
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,600
- Come here.
- Wait!

644
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,000
If he's going to take over
the family business

645
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:38,160
How come he's staying
in your apartment?

646
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:39,320
What's your logic?

647
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:42,960
Sa, I think you should reconcile with Ohm.

648
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,520
He's a married man.

649
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,360
Not that he can't get divorced

650
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,600
But the age gap of almost 10 years...

651
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,400
can't be reduced to a couple of years

652
01:03:53,435 --> 01:03:55,840
Can't you just keep
your feet on the ground?

653
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,720
A high school kid dreams
as big as he can.

654
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,280
You guys live in two different worlds.

655
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,880
Whoa, I'm starving.

656
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:33,880
Are you all right?

657
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,760
How's your work today?

658
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:48,000
Meeting with the client today
made me so exhausted.

659
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,080
They changed the plan
again and again.

660
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:53,800
When I said I couldn't finish it
by the last quarter.

661
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,560
My boss simply told me

662
01:04:55,595 --> 01:04:57,040
find a subcontract to beat the deadline.

663
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,760
If I can't carry out this project,

664
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,520
I won't get bonus this year.

665
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,840
What should I do?

666
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,280
Seriously..

667
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,800
What is 'the last quarter'?

668
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:30,320
Well, now that you're escaping home...

669
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,040
What did your dad say?

670
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,280
He doesn't know it yet.

671
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,680
For how long do you expect?

672
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,840
- I'm not going back.
- What?

673
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,400
But don't worry about my future plan,

674
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,480
I have plan B.

675
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:49,160
I'll work as a pub musician.

676
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,680
Totally, 5,000-6,000 baht a month.

677
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,400
I'll be able to feed you well.

678
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:56,720
Right.

679
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:03,080
Yes, meeting is set
at 10 o'clock tomorrow.

680
01:06:03,115 --> 01:06:04,520
Wait a sec. Sorry.

681
01:06:04,555 --> 01:06:06,240
Hello?
Yes. Wait a moment please.

682
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,400
Excuse me?
All right, I've found it.

683
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,600
Of course, I can do it.

684
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:17,480
How can I possibly finish all the work?

685
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,720
Hire some freelance to do the work.

686
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:26,640
I think subcontracting is worth investment.

687
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,520
And you'd be able to wrap up the project
before last quarter deadline.

688
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,880
What would you say?

689
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,840
Want me to find you a contact list?

690
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:36,240
Ohm

691
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,720
I already solved my problem.

692
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,960
From now on, I can take care of you.

693
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,440
You've come back to me...

694
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,960
Wouldn't Pam mind at all?

695
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,160
She doesn't care about me.

696
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:56,920
We get married

697
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,200
because she's pregnant and left alone

698
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,200
We don't really love each other.

699
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,200
The one I do love...

700
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:10,560
...is you.

701
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:21,280
Although I'm with Pam,

702
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:24,680
I always think about you.

703
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,200
Pam and I don't get along well

704
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:37,640
I think we fit together so well

705
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,040
Don't you think so?

706
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:01,600
"Ohm is back"

707
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,120
Can I stay with you for a while?

708
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:37,880
All right.

709
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,920
But don't let your dad know
where you are.

710
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,800
I saw your dad's henchmen the other day.

711
01:08:45,835 --> 01:08:48,840
They looked like bandits.
I'm scared for you.

712
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,880
I don't think you can escape this time, Bass.

713
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,600
My dad is forcing me to study abroad.

714
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,320
You'd better keep a low profile.

715
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:01,720
Don't wander off for a while.

716
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,160
Got your fake ID card yet?

717
01:09:07,195 --> 01:09:08,840
I've got mine.

718
01:09:08,875 --> 01:09:11,120
So that we can play a gig at that pub.
Got yours?

719
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,200
They told me I didn't need one.

720
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,080
Believe me, you can blend in easily.

721
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,800
- With a face like me?
- it’ll be a breeze.

722
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,200
I look so young.
How could I pass?

723
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:22,280
Are you crazy?

724
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,000
Ohm is back.

725
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,320
I knew it!

726
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,360
By the way, who's Ohm?

727
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:33,200
Right.

728
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,680
He's my girlfriend's ex-boyfriend.

729
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,240
And he's her first love.

730
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:44,120
So?
You're a hotshot.

731
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:47,800
Although your dad...
constantly beats you up.

732
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,400
- How come is he better than you?
- Right.

733
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,560
He's got a house..
a car...

734
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:54,600
and a high paying permanent job.

735
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,160
I'll go for Ohm.

736
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,880
Come on. Come on.

737
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,600
"Incoming Call - Bass"

738
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:20,480
Oh, god!
The clash of boyfriends!

739
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,240
The doomsday is falling on us, Mham.

740
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,240
We should flee right now.

741
01:11:27,275 --> 01:11:28,360
Let's go.

742
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,600
Hey, Jane.. Mham

743
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,200
- Hi, Ohm.
- Hi there.

744
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,280
Is Sa here?
I've been calling her several times.

745
01:11:42,315 --> 01:11:43,840
She doesn't answer the phone.

746
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:47,560
She said she'd be out running
some errands.

747
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:50,400
- She might not come back today.
- That's right.

748
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,440
You shouldn't wait.
It's a waste of time.

749
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:57,240
I'm bringing her the freelance contact list.

750
01:11:57,275 --> 01:11:58,680
Here it is.
Please give it to her.

751
01:11:58,715 --> 01:11:59,360
Sure.

752
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:03,600
Splendid.
She's using her ex-boyfriend.

753
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,320
You have any plans
for your next vacation?

754
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,840
No, we haven't.

755
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,640
Good.
I've booked a hotel package in Phuket.

756
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,280
I'm taking Sa and
her family on a vacation.

757
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,800
If you don't have any plan, join us.

758
01:12:17,835 --> 01:12:19,600
Well, I..
Thank you.

759
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:20,960
I think you'd better go.

760
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,360
Or rush into the emergency room.

761
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,560
Be smacked by the boy.

762
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,360
You'd better go.

763
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,240
Please handle that for me.

764
01:12:30,275 --> 01:12:31,400
- I will.
- Sure.

765
01:12:31,435 --> 01:12:33,680
- Thank you very much.
- Bye bye.

766
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:43,120
That's it.
There he goes.

767
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,720
We'll bring you a sympathy gift basket, Ohm.

768
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:53,960
Thank you.

769
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:06,000
Thank you.

770
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:11,640
Hey, Bass.

771
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,920
She couldn't find you at the school.

772
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:15,320
So she's been waiting for you here.

773
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,360
Why didn't you go to school?

774
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:26,280
You could be expelled for skipping school.

775
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:34,040
Hey..

776
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:35,600
Hey, look.

777
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,840
I bought a maths books today.

778
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,400
So you would stop calling me stupid.

779
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,680
Let's see what it's all about.

780
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:49,480
Here!
Calculus.. Integration.

781
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,960
Probability... Oh?

782
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,080
Do you have a lot of free time?

783
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,560
You don't have to try this hard.

784
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,720
No need to understand what you don't.

785
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,560
I won't try to understand...

786
01:14:05,595 --> 01:14:07,520
what 'last quarter' is either.

787
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:13,800
But I..
I finished the first chapter.

788
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:18,480
And now I can solve this kind of equation.

789
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,920
- Hey!
- Huh? What?

790
01:14:21,955 --> 01:14:23,320
What song are we going to play?

791
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:25,600
Ah.. well..

792
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,960
I told you that the rich boy...

793
01:14:27,995 --> 01:14:29,000
.. is damn self-willed.

794
01:14:29,035 --> 01:14:29,880
You'd better go back.

795
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,880
"You are my love - Ohm"

796
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:10,960
Ohm?

797
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:18,920
Wise choice that you are now dating Ohm.

798
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,800
Sorry, I'm late.

799
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,400
I have an urgent thing to do.

800
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,560
She doesn't care about her baby.

801
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:37,920
I took pity on this little one.

802
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,760
So I'm taking care of him for now.

803
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,320
Well, you're such a good guy.

804
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:48,760
So much love for women,
children, and everyone.

805
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,480
So much, very much!

806
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,000
You two might have a long conversation.

807
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:57,440
We will take care of your baby.

808
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:00,040
- It'd be better.
- Come with me, sweaty.

809
01:17:00,075 --> 01:17:01,320
Please take care of her.

810
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,240
How cute!

811
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:06,520
Here.

812
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:15,640
Sa...

813
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,720
You wouldn't mind, would you?

814
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:21,560
Not at all.

815
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:36,680
Ohm...

816
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:40,200
Pam

817
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:42,520
Where are you?

818
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:47,000
You sound so drunk.
Where are you?

819
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,440
Park right there.
Don't drive.

820
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,480
I'll pick you up in an hour.

821
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:54,560
Just park right there.

822
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,560
Sa, let's order some food.

823
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,400
- Don't you have to pick...
- Order some food.

824
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:19,560
Well.. I'd like to..

825
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:25,080
thank you for bringing me the contact list.

826
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:29,040
Pardon me?

827
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:32,720
I said...

828
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:36,480
thank you for bringing me the contact list.

829
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:41,880
Jen and Mham would love
to join our trip to Phuket.

830
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:45,640
That's all right.

831
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,880
Good. Good.
The more, the merrier.

832
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,920
You'd better go seeing Pam.

833
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:14,200
Sa, today is all about you.

834
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,200
But all

835
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,840
You are thinking of is Pam, right?

836
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:24,680
Sa...

837
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,280
I understand.

838
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:30,400
It happens to me as well.

839
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,520
I'm trying to be with you.

840
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,000
But what really happens is that...

841
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,440
All the time that we're sitting here,

842
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:44,760
my mind is on someone else.

843
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:48,440
I think we feel the same thing.

844
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,440
We thought it's wiser

845
01:19:51,475 --> 01:19:53,440
to be with someone in a league of our own.

846
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:55,880
But what really happens...

847
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,840
What we are doing is against our hearts.

848
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:15,240
Sa...

849
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:20,480
Thank you.

850
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,760
Hey, Sa.
Are you going to work?

851
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:41,560
- I'll give you a ride.
- That's OK. I can go to work myself.

852
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,280
Come on, Sa.

853
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:46,120
Think of it as a ride with a brother.

854
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:52,160
I want to thank you for understanding me.

855
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:55,840
You made me realize
what I really need to do.

856
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,840
To show you how grateful I am,

857
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:03,760
I'll take you out for a treat tonight.

858
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,400
Invite as many friends as you'd like.

859
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:09,280
All right?

860
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,000
Hello, everyone!

861
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,280
All single ladies, put your hands up!

862
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,320
Did anyone here sneak out from boyfriend?

863
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:09,000
All single and not-so-single ladies,

864
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:12,760
On this special night, we'll have a fun activity.
We're going to have...

865
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:16,320
An auction for a kiss with our hot singer!

866
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:22,520
Give me some noise!

867
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,760
Even a frog like him
can make girls scream.

868
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:35,920
If they put my kiss on an auction,
girls will go gaga over it.

869
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:37,400
Right.

870
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,800
I can't imagine that day.

871
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:43,000
Whoo!
Look yummy!

872
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:46,040
Watch me.
His kiss must be mine.

873
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:50,120
First bid... 500 baht!

874
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:53,240
Wow, haven't started bidding yet
but we already got 500.

875
01:22:53,275 --> 01:22:55,200
Do I hear a higher bid?

876
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:56,360
800!

877
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:57,680
1,000!

878
01:22:58,120 --> 01:22:59,560
2,000!

879
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:05,000
Jane, don't you think 2,000 baht
is too expensive?

880
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,360
- C'mon.
- Just sit there.

881
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,360
I want him.

882
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:08,560
5,000!

883
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,680
Ready to drop the hammer
and announce that I win?

884
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,000
Sa, can I borrow your money?

885
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:24,360
Jane..

886
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:27,000
Take this.

887
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:28,640
Thank you, Ohm.

888
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,480
5,500 baht!

889
01:23:33,515 --> 01:23:36,280
5,500 baht, going once.

890
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:40,040
5,500 baht, going twice.

891
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:41,360
And...

892
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:42,920
And..

893
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:46,320
5,500 baht... Sold!

894
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:51,240
To Table R3!

895
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,840
Well, excuse me.

896
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:59,000
I have my own rule to kiss only real girls.

897
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,440
We won the auction.

898
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,640
If I don't get the kiss,

899
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:07,040
One of the girls at my table must get it.

900
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:12,000
Sa, it's you.

901
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:13,600
Go on.

902
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:17,160
- Hurry up, otherwise it'll be our lost.
- Yes, it's you.

903
01:24:17,195 --> 01:24:20,080
May the winner come up here.

904
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:23,160
- Hurry up!
- Go on.

905
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,000
Hurry up.
It's your chance. So cute.

906
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:29,480
Go on.

907
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:33,760
- Wow, if you're ready..
- Go on.

908
01:24:33,795 --> 01:24:35,800
Prepare to be kissed.

909
01:24:35,835 --> 01:24:37,480
- You guys!
- Sa!

910
01:24:37,515 --> 01:24:40,320
Have you ever cared to ask me first?

911
01:24:40,355 --> 01:24:42,400
Don't play hard to get.
Here's your chance.

912
01:24:42,435 --> 01:24:45,200
Come on!
Look, he's so handsome.

913
01:24:45,235 --> 01:24:46,400
Cute!

914
01:24:46,435 --> 01:24:51,600
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

915
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:36,000
Bass

916
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:42,360
- Let me kiss you instead.
- No, thank you.

917
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:58,440
Bass! Bass!

918
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:06,720
Ohm

919
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,040
That kid...

920
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:14,480
His father is Mr. Kriengkrai?

921
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:18,120
Do you know Bass's father?

922
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:19,920
Kriengkrai...

923
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:22,800
is the father of Pam's baby.

924
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:39,000
- I've got him.
- Get off me! Let me go!

925
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:43,880
Get ready to go to the airport.

926
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,800
All you care about is music
and your girlfriend.

927
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:48,520
You need to learn a lesson.

928
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,240
You need to stop acting like a lunatic.

929
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:58,800
You don't want to see
your girl in trouble, do you?

930
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,840
Sa... good luck.

931
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:29,880
You too, Ohm.

932
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:52,520
If love is like waiting for a bus.

933
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:59,880
Sometimes even we catch the right one,

934
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,080
it doesn't mean
we'd always have a smooth ride.

935
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:14,400
- Pam!
- I used to feel reluctant to get on a bus.

936
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:17,600
- But from now on, I won't be afraid of it.
- Leave me alone!

937
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:18,400
Pam!

938
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:18,920
And if that bus is going to run away from me,

939
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:20,880
I'll run after it. Bass!

940
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,560
Bass! Bass!

941
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,920
Bass! Bass!

942
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:28,160
Bass!

943
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:40,160
Bass!

944
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:42,640
Bass!

945
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:44,000
Bass!

946
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:16,520
Are you out of your mind?

947
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,560
Why are you running after me?

948
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:32,960
You told me once..

949
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:39,080
You wanted to see me tying
your tie every morning.

950
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:44,640
Don't you want to see it anymore?

951
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:11,840
Bass!

952
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:17,680
Bass!

953
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:23,560
Bass!

954
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:12,120
5 years later.

955
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:36,320
Yes, Mom.

956
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,560
Still have a headache, Mom.

957
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:43,880
I'll go to bed soon.

958
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:50,480
Tle and Tik?

959
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:53,360
You don't have to send them over here.

960
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:57,040
I can take care of myself.
I'm fine.

961
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:01,960
I'm going to bed now.

962
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:03,680
Bye bye.

963
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:45,240
Yes, Mom.

964
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,200
Have Tle and Tik arrived there yet?

965
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,240
Tle and Tik?

966
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:58,480
Yes, I send them to check you
out last night.

967
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:02,280
Sa

968
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:03,880
Do you hear me?

969
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:06,920
Yes, Mom.

970
01:36:06,955 --> 01:36:08,480
Call me if you need anything.

971
01:36:08,515 --> 01:36:09,800
Thank you.

972
01:36:09,835 --> 01:36:11,040
Yes, dear.

973
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:05,920
Please sign here, Mr. Janepob.

974
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:16,360
Thank you.

975
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:18,600
Wait.

976
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:20,080
Yes?

977
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:23,840
You're fired.

978
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:36,840
My name is Jeannie.

979
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:39,080
Dare to show off.

980
01:40:39,115 --> 01:40:40,560
Have you tucked and taped yet?
