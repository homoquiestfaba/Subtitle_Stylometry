1
00:01:28,824 --> 00:01:30,628
We are not an established gang yet!

2
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:38,600
My friend, you should be very cautious.

3
00:01:38,601 --> 00:01:42,297
In my opinion,
we should try to make friends with all the gangs,

4
00:01:42,835 --> 00:01:44,498
The Japanese, the Chinese.

5
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:51,861
Al Capone once said,
"There is enough money
to be made in this business for all of us." 

6
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,829
It's all up to Fujiyama.

7
00:01:54,154 --> 00:01:57,644
He wants to make a certain treaty
with the Chinese gangs,
not the Japanese, 

8
00:01:57,678 --> 00:01:59,264
especially the Ginzas. 

9
00:01:59,962 --> 00:02:01,352
 Here comes the boss.

10
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:13,172
What happened, Okamura-san?

11
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,473
No. No deals, no friendships with anybody.

13
00:02:22,422 --> 00:02:26,188
- Right now, I want that old Chinese fox dead. 
- Okay, Boss.

14
00:02:27,588 --> 00:02:31,510
You heard the order?
I do not agree with the fighting.

15
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:37,566
Okamura, it is not for us to decide.
It is up to the boss. 

16
00:02:39,094 --> 00:02:40,671
It's the order of Katana.

17
00:02:43,191 --> 00:02:44,608
We fight.

18
00:03:14,454 --> 00:03:16,854
Good morning, Mr. Li. 

19
00:03:19,923 --> 00:03:21,589
Have you decided to work with us?

20
00:03:27,631 --> 00:03:30,307
In no way we go under Fujiyama's flack.

21
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:35,260
Mr. Fujiyama doesn't want to waste any more time. 

22
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,817
- Come on, come on. Let's get going.
- Move it! 

23
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:01,050
- You did it.
- The job is done. 

24
00:04:07,842 --> 00:04:10,545
I'm responsible for bringing you from San Diego, 

25
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,248
are you sure this is a good bust? 

26
00:04:13,283 --> 00:04:14,228
Yeah, cocaine. 

27
00:04:18,929 --> 00:04:21,304
- Sergeant, how are you? 
- I'm just fine. 

28
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:25,823
- We're going to go catch us some bad guys. 
- Good luck. Call me if you need me. 

29
00:04:25,858 --> 00:04:27,607
- See you.
- See you later.
- All right.

30
00:05:01,143 --> 00:05:04,689
- Who gave you the information? 
- A Chinese gang member. 

31
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:07,690
His boss was killed by the Katana gang. 

32
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:11,585
There's the blue van over there. 

33
00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:13,956
- So the van belongs to the Katana gang? 
- Yeah. 

34
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,530
Let's call for the helicopter. 

35
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,020
- Peggy, where are you? 
- I'm landing.

36
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:27,235
No, no, no, don't land. We need you.
I'll give you the direction. 

37
00:06:07,798 --> 00:06:09,471
I can see the blue van. 

38
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:32,635
- Peggy, Peggy, do you hear me? 
- Yeah, Frank. I can hear you. 

39
00:06:33,456 --> 00:06:34,758
Watch for the boat.

40
00:06:40,544 --> 00:06:44,319
There's lots of boats in the marina.
How am I supposed to know
which one is carrying the coke? 

41
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,602
Just keep an eye on the van, Peggy. 
I'm well-informed there's a large suitcase
full of coke in the back. 

42
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,007
They're going to make the swap somewhere in the marina.

43
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:56,381
- Just stay close to them. 
- Okay, Joe. Keep it up. 

44
00:06:56,602 --> 00:06:59,168
Oh, it's up and ready, you just keep it warm.

45
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:01,403
It's warm and ready. 

46
00:07:25,007 --> 00:07:27,121
Okay guys, I think we're getting close. 

47
00:07:27,122 --> 00:07:31,545
- There's a boat headed full speed towards the van. 
- Good, good. Just follow.

48
00:07:33,326 --> 00:07:37,116
- Try to stay out of sight, Peggy.
I don't want you scaring them off. 
- You got it, Joe. 

49
00:08:07,802 --> 00:08:10,298
- They'll come with the boat? 
- Yeah, yeah. 

50
00:08:13,346 --> 00:08:15,524
You stay here and wait.

51
00:08:24,532 --> 00:08:28,050
Hey Peggy, can you see them?
It seems like we've lost them.


52
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,846
They'll have to come by this way,
it's the only road out. 

53
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:56,748
Shoot! Shoot them!

53
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,600
- Stop!
- Hold on.

54
00:11:05,814 --> 00:11:06,814
I got him! 

55
00:11:08,762 --> 00:11:10,262
Hey, hold on, hold on.
Hold on.

55
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,400
Ow!

56
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:15,825
Hey man, watch it.
Watch it.
Oh, man. 

57
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:24,230
- Hey, let's call for backup.
- We'll call them when we need them.

58
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:35,469
Shoot, shoot them! 

59
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,934
Shoot, shoot them! 

59
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,900
Shoot, shoot.

60
00:11:50,162 --> 00:11:52,662 
- You got him.
- Yeah, I got the bastard.

61
00:12:06,781 --> 00:12:08,181
Let's go. Go! 

62
00:12:20,212 --> 00:12:23,342
Faster. Go, go, faster. 

63
00:13:20,422 --> 00:13:22,254
He's burning! He's burning! 

64
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:26,575
He's on fire! He's on fire!
He's burning! Burning!

65
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,750
Do something!
Man, he's burning!

65
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:33,917
- We got to do something! 
- Man, you grab the blanket.
I'll get the fire extinguisher.

66
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:42,427
Put the blanket on him. 

67
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:45,668
That's it, that's it.
That's enough, he's out. 

68
00:13:52,846 --> 00:13:56,146
Good job guys. This calls for a celebration.

69
00:13:57,825 --> 00:14:01,125
You got it.
I'll see you back at your place. 

71
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:48,032
The boss is coming.

72
00:16:07,873 --> 00:16:13,273
- So they call him samurai, huh? 
- Yes. His real name is Joe Marshall.

73
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:19,274
He speaks fluent Japanese.
He got his martial arts training from the masters in Japan. 

74
00:16:20,687 --> 00:16:24,887
He was brought over here from the police force
in San Diego to fight us. 

75
00:16:25,088 --> 00:16:27,888
To fight us?
To fight me. 

76
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:33,989
To destroy my operation.
To kill you and my other men.
To put handcuffs on me

77
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,990
and put me in the gas chamber.

78
00:16:40,715 --> 00:16:45,515
Samurai, if he is a samurai,
what the hell are you? 

79
00:16:45,716 --> 00:16:49,316
I'll get to know him and then we'll see
who the real samurai is. 

80
00:16:49,317 --> 00:16:51,517
So you know where our man is? 

81
00:16:51,518 --> 00:16:54,518
Yes boss.
I know the hospital and the room. 

82
00:16:54,519 --> 00:17:00,519
And he's burned bad, real bad.
He won't be able to talk.

83
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,720
I want him dead.
I want his head cut off and brought here. 

84
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,060
I want his head on this piano,

85
00:17:07,061 --> 00:17:10,161
so that every man
in my organization understands once more

86
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:14,762
that no Katana gets captured alive or talks.
Got that?! 

87
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:24,465
I will bring you his head
and I will place it on your piano. 

88
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:27,166
I know the real samurai is here.

89
00:17:31,837 --> 00:17:35,837
So, I'm lying there in bed with probably,
the most beautiful woman I've ever met in my life. 

90
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:37,838
Hey, what are you talking about? 

91
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:40,439
I'm just kidding.
You know you're number one. 

92
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,040
- So anyway, this guy-
- I've heard enough of the stories.

93
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:49,041
So anyway, you get on the phone and you tell me that this,
what's his name, Omaha, Yamaha, whatever his face
or his name is right, is after me? 

94
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:53,642
So I figure, I'm going to have to knock a couple
of these guys off and I know I'm going to get the speech
from Captain Roma,

95
00:17:53,643 --> 00:17:57,143
"I've told you guys, I don't want anymore dead bodies."
Well, what am I gonna- 

96
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,744
Frank, come to my office.

97
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:07,379
- Hi Joe.
- Hi Aoki. 

98
00:18:13,408 --> 00:18:16,808
- In trouble again?
- What's it going to be today?

98
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,000
- Hello sir.
- Joe.

99
00:18:27,068 --> 00:18:29,468
- Hey Steve, how are you doing?
- What's going on Steve?

100
00:18:29,969 --> 00:18:33,769
Not much sir.
There's a nurse and they're giving him an injection.
He's burned pretty bad. 

101
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,770
Let's check it out.

102
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:50,105
- Hello.
- Hi.

103
00:18:50,106 --> 00:18:53,606
How is he?
Do you think he'll be able to answer a few questions? 

104
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:56,207
No way. His lips are burned.

105
00:18:56,208 --> 00:19:01,208
- So what? He'll never be able to talk again? 
- Oh, he'll talk again but you just have to
give him a couple of weeks. 

106
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:05,209
- Next time guys, catch him in one piece.
- Thanks, nurse.

107
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,710
- Do you like what you see?
- I love what I see.

108
00:19:10,469 --> 00:19:15,269
- Would you like to touch what you see?
- Yes. Yes, I would.

109
00:19:16,134 --> 00:19:20,834
- Would you like to go out with me?
- Uh-huh. Yes, I would.

110
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:24,367
Would you like to fuck me?

111
00:19:29,363 --> 00:19:32,963
- Bingo.
- Well then let's see what you've got.

112
00:19:35,273 --> 00:19:39,273
- It doesn't interest me. Nothing there.
- Nothing there?

113
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:47,670
Just exactly, what would interest you? 
Something the size of a jumbo jet?

114
00:19:50,024 --> 00:19:53,524
- Have you been circumcised? 
- Yeah, I have. Why?

115
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:57,025
Well, your doctor must have cut a big portion of it off.

116
00:19:57,026 --> 00:20:01,826
- No. He was a good doctor.
- Good doctors make mistakes too.

117
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:07,827
- That's why they buy insurance. 
- Hey, don't worry. I got enough. 

118
00:20:08,228 --> 00:20:11,228
- It's big. 
- I want bigger.

119
00:20:12,203 --> 00:20:13,803
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I have uh...

120
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:19,467
- Have you been circumcised? 
- Shut up.

121
00:20:22,344 --> 00:20:25,344
Okay, Steve, I want you
to watch the room and watch it good. 

122
00:20:26,564 --> 00:20:28,964
You got three more officers coming to assist you. 

123
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:32,245
And remember, no one goes in the room except for
doctors and nurses, got it? 

124
00:20:32,246 --> 00:20:33,946
- Okay, Joe.
- All right, let's go.

125
00:20:47,662 --> 00:20:49,962
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi, Frank. How are you doing? 

126
00:20:49,963 --> 00:20:54,263
Watch the room from all sides.
The burned man is very important to us. 

127
00:20:54,264 --> 00:20:55,264
Okay, sir.

128
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:08,129
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?
- I have to change the trash, is that all right? 

129
00:21:10,175 --> 00:21:11,175
All right. 

130
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
Oh, my God.

131
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:50,669
Call security!

132
00:24:10,864 --> 00:24:12,264
I'm in corridor 2.

133
00:24:20,337 --> 00:24:22,637
Hey, wait a minute, nurse.
Wait a minute.

134
00:24:35,703 --> 00:24:37,003
Get up.

135
00:24:42,012 --> 00:24:43,412
Good job.

136
00:24:52,501 --> 00:24:55,901
No one's around.
Let's go. 

137
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,150
Hey, wait a minute.
I want to talk to you. 

138
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,495
Hey, wait a minute, stop.

139
00:25:38,945 --> 00:25:40,645
Come on, come on, let's get going.
Move it.

140
00:25:49,992 --> 00:25:53,192
Hey, hey, wait a minute.
Hey, wait a minute, doctor.
I'd like to talk to you. 

141
00:25:53,273 --> 00:25:55,573
Can I see some ID?

142
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:25,390
- Captain, what did I do wrong? 
- Everything you did was wrong.

143
00:26:25,903 --> 00:26:29,322
You're the one that talked me into bringing this moron
from San Diego
144
00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:31,969
to fight that Japanese Katana gang.

145
00:26:32,004 --> 00:26:35,904
You know what the results are?
A man in our custody lost his head,

146
00:26:35,905 --> 00:26:40,905
an officer lost his hand,
and there are three police officers
in the hospital right now. 

147
00:26:40,906 --> 00:26:43,812
God damn you guys.
All you've done is cause me

148
00:26:43,847 --> 00:26:45,727
bloodshed and mayhem.

149
00:26:45,762 --> 00:26:47,607
And me, misery in my future.

150
00:26:48,302 --> 00:26:52,302
This man has been here one week and I almost lost my job.

151
00:26:52,303 --> 00:26:54,603
If he's here one more week, I might well end up in jail

152
00:26:54,604 --> 00:26:56,762
and die of a heart attack and I don't like that.

153
00:26:57,005 --> 00:27:00,230
- SHey, I've been here one week.
- And just how long will it take you
to bring him to their knees?

154
00:27:00,388 --> 00:27:02,878
One week? One month?
Next year?

155
00:27:03,092 --> 00:27:05,085
At what cost and how many lives?

156
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,407
With all due respect sir, now I can get these guys.
All I'm asking for is more time. 

157
00:27:09,408 --> 00:27:11,715
But I don't have the time and I don't have the patience.

158
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:15,871
And I don't have much more credit in this department
to have bodies lying around me. 

159
00:27:15,906 --> 00:27:19,709
Fine. You don't want me here anymore?
All you got to do is ship me back to my place in San Diego.

160
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,710
You bet your ass I will.
You're on your way to San Diego and I'll write the order. 

161
00:27:24,617 --> 00:27:26,817
Hey, Joe.
Wait, just wait.

162
00:27:28,736 --> 00:27:32,736
Look, captain, you know it, and they know it themselves.

163
00:27:32,737 --> 00:27:36,137
And what they want is results.
That's what we're going to give them.
We're going to give them the results. 

164
00:27:37,767 --> 00:27:42,744
Now, why don't we give Samurai here a second chance
because I need him, we need him, so why don't we just help him 

165
00:27:43,268 --> 00:27:47,362
and support him, all right?
Well, what do you say huh, cap?

166
00:27:48,109 --> 00:27:52,109
I feel like somebody stuck a big club up my ass and it hurts.

167
00:27:52,911 --> 00:27:56,411
I've got to figure out a way to get it out of there.

168
00:27:56,412 --> 00:28:00,212
God damn it, get the hell out of my office.
Get out of here!
I don't want to see your face. 

169
00:28:04,906 --> 00:28:05,835
Muah!

170
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:09,519
You son of a bitch.
Come back here you motherfucker! 

171
00:28:25,926 --> 00:28:29,726
- What happened? You out or in? 
- Baby, I'm always in.

172
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:35,527
Okay, Mr. Joe Samurai, now that you're in,
I've got some interesting news for you.

173
00:28:35,528 --> 00:28:37,128
What is it? 

174
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:42,529
Well, it seems there's this restaurant,
Blue Lagoon on Third Street near Downtown.

175
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:48,530
Well, Mr. Fujiyama, the head of the Katana gang,
this is where he's been hanging out.

176
00:28:48,531 --> 00:28:51,931
- What does Katana mean?
- It means Japanese sword.

177
00:28:53,304 --> 00:28:57,104
Also, there are two other Japanese gangs,
the Shinjuku and Ginza gangs.

178
00:28:57,105 --> 00:29:00,105
They're both rivals to the Katana.

179
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:03,306
All right, both of those gangs are willing
to cooperate with us. 

180
00:29:03,307 --> 00:29:07,307
They're a small gang, mostly in gambling.

181
00:29:07,308 --> 00:29:11,308
They're afraid of Katana.
That's why they're willing to help us. 

182
00:29:13,194 --> 00:29:15,894
All right, in time,
we'll use their service but not now.

183
00:29:15,895 --> 00:29:19,895
Right now, I say you and I go pay a visit
to this Blue Lagoon Restaurant. 

184
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:27,999
- You want to go? 
- I can't, but I'll be home later on.

185
00:29:29,688 --> 00:29:33,288
I may stop by, so keep it warm.

186
00:29:33,943 --> 00:29:36,143
Come on, Frank, let's go. 

187
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:47,121
Jennifer, I have a small present for you.

188
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:50,254
Thank you Mr. Fujiyama but I don't know
if I should accept that.

189
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,368
Please, take it.

190
00:30:03,891 --> 00:30:06,391
Thank you. It's beautiful. 

191
00:30:09,598 --> 00:30:12,598
Hello, Mr. Fujiyama.
Hi, everybody. 

192
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:15,199
- Hey, Tony. You're late.
- Oh, sorry.

193
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,500
- Please have a seat.
- Thanks.

194
00:30:40,203 --> 00:30:44,703
- Are you Fuj... Fujiyama?
- Yes, I am. Who are you? 

195
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:46,542
I'm a cop.

196
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:53,067
In that case, you'll talk to me.
I am Mr. Fujiyama's attorney. 

197
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:54,468
What do you want?

198
00:30:54,469 --> 00:30:58,169
So you're the infamous boss of this shit Katana gang, huh?

199
00:31:08,822 --> 00:31:10,222
Sit down.

200
00:31:16,067 --> 00:31:20,067
Look. Officer, you have no right insulting my client.

201
00:31:20,068 --> 00:31:23,068
- You have nothing on him.
- And yes we have.

202
00:31:23,069 --> 00:31:27,065
We have many things on him.
And this client of yours is going to need more than a lawyer

203
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,724
to clean up his shit. 

204
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:32,771
Officers,
if you have anything against me, then book me.

205
00:31:32,772 --> 00:31:35,972
Otherwise, as they say, "Get the hell out of my face."

206
00:31:36,473 --> 00:31:39,973
This is America, land of freedom and law.

207
00:31:41,709 --> 00:31:46,309
A man is innocent until he's proven guilty.
You have nothing on me. 

208
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,610
Well, I got a lot of shit on you.

209
00:31:51,071 --> 00:31:56,071
I'll sue you and the department
for this insult to my client.

210
00:31:56,072 --> 00:31:58,872
I'll file a case first thing in the morning.

211
00:31:58,873 --> 00:32:02,873
Hey counselor, 
you still have three or four hours before the courthouse closes.

212
00:32:05,163 --> 00:32:10,163
Now, I'm telling these son of a bitches,
that we respect the Japanese of this country 

213
00:32:10,164 --> 00:32:14,664
who are honest businessmen.
And yeah, this is the land of opportunity 

214
00:32:14,665 --> 00:32:19,065
for legitimate business, not for death merchants

215
00:32:19,066 --> 00:32:23,066
who distribute drugs to our children
through schools and on the streets.

216
00:32:24,355 --> 00:32:29,355
Now, I'm telling these motherfuckers
that if they continue killing our children

217
00:32:29,356 --> 00:32:32,956
to make their precious millions that they deposit
in their secret Swiss bank accounts...

218
00:32:34,602 --> 00:32:38,202
Counselor,
before your lawsuit even gets off the court clerk's desk,

219
00:32:38,203 --> 00:32:41,603
I'll have their stinking bodies in garbage bags

220
00:32:41,604 --> 00:32:44,104
and ship them back to Japan for fertilizer,

221
00:32:44,105 --> 00:32:45,505
got it?

222
00:32:45,906 --> 00:32:47,506
And you, too.

223
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,780
Excuse me, miss. 

224
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:59,481
By the way, what's an all-American girl like you
doing with a geek like this? 

225
00:33:07,713 --> 00:33:09,313
See you around.

226
00:33:16,488 --> 00:33:19,188
Hey, counselor, we'll see you in court.


228
00:33:27,889 --> 00:33:33,689
- Who's that blond girl?
- Oh, her name is Jennifer.
She's the boss.

229
00:33:34,025 --> 00:33:38,725
- The boss? You mean she owns this place?
- Her mother owns the place.

230
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:41,526
- Where is her father?
- Bang.

231
00:33:41,527 --> 00:33:44,527
- Killed? Who shot him?
- He.

232
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:45,728
- Who?
- Him.

233
00:33:45,829 --> 00:33:47,729
- Who's him?
- Himself.

234
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,919
- Oh, he committed suicide?
- Yes.

235
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:58,320
Listen, when you see Jennifer alone,
tell her I think she is very lovely. 

236
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:00,361
I'll do that. 

237
00:34:00,362 --> 00:34:04,962
- Tell her I'll try to see her soon. 
- Good. I'll help you.

238
00:34:05,183 --> 00:34:06,683
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

239
00:34:06,684 --> 00:34:09,984
I like cops.
My cousin's a cop.

240
00:34:10,806 --> 00:34:14,306
- Oh, really? Where?
- In Costa Rica.

240
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,555
Oh, good.

241
00:34:16,936 --> 00:34:21,236
- What's your name? 
- Alfonso Rafael Federico Sebastián.

242
00:34:21,437 --> 00:34:26,437
- This is my first name. 
- Uh, what's your last name?

243
00:34:26,438 --> 00:34:29,938
- Oh.
- Oh, that's all right. We just need your first name.
Thanks a lot. Bye.

244
00:34:29,939 --> 00:34:33,539
Bye, bye.
I'll tell my cousin I know you. 

245
00:34:35,794 --> 00:34:37,532
Why didn't you let me hear his last name?

246
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:41,329
Oh, come on, man.
His last name would have made a book.

247
00:34:41,364 --> 00:34:42,796
Hey, check it out.

248
00:35:12,683 --> 00:35:14,083
You're under arrest! 

249
00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:06,289
Idiots.
Get my men dead or alive.
Move!

250
00:36:13,096 --> 00:36:15,596
So what are you going to do,
fight this guy barehanded? 

251
00:36:27,716 --> 00:36:32,642
Freeze, you motherfuckers, leave him alone!
Uncuff him. I mean it, uncuff him!

252
00:36:43,195 --> 00:36:44,895
Damn.

253
00:36:51,298 --> 00:36:52,998
Frank, look out!

254
00:37:24,607 --> 00:37:26,207
Come on, get out of here! 

255
00:38:37,689 --> 00:38:43,189
- Son of a bitch. He killed his own men. 
- I know. It's called code of silence. 

256
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:48,190
- He doesn't want anybody talking.
- God. And look what they've done to my car.

257
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:52,991
- Captain Rome is going to burn my ass.
- Yeah, he's going to burn it charcoal black.

258
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:56,692
- It is black. 
- Right on.

259
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:00,838
Get the hell out of here. 

260
00:39:02,294 --> 00:39:04,994
Captain, what do you want me to do about the case? 

261
00:39:04,995 --> 00:39:07,795
- What case? 
- The Los Feliz case.

262
00:39:07,796 --> 00:39:11,796
You're the officer in charge of the case, go do it.
Bring me an arrest. 

263
00:39:13,775 --> 00:39:15,275
All right, captain. 

264
00:39:17,497 --> 00:39:24,497
- Mr. Fujiyama is very upset.
- Yes, counselor. I mean, he has every right to be,

265
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:29,670
- but frankly, I don't give a damn.
- But Captain Roma, let me warn you.

266
00:39:29,671 --> 00:39:34,170
Fuck you and your client.
And you get your ass out of my office

267
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,572
or you'll have to go to surgery
to get my foot out of it. 

268
00:39:36,573 --> 00:39:39,573
Get out of here, you asshole!
Leave me alone.

269
00:39:39,574 --> 00:39:42,574
I got more important things than a sheister like you.
Get out of here! 

270
00:39:42,775 --> 00:39:47,175
- I'll see you in court.
- You motherfucker, I'll see you in hell.

271
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,476
Leave me alone.
Get a job! 

272
00:40:06,128 --> 00:40:08,628
Mr. Okamura, the police officer is here.

273
00:40:10,795 --> 00:40:11,795
Come on in.

274
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:22,379
- Hi.
- Hi.

275
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,711
I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd stop by to see you.

276
00:40:25,755 --> 00:40:30,957
- Police questions?
- No, no, just friendly conversation.

277
00:40:31,225 --> 00:40:34,925
You know, rumor has it that, you own the restaurant.

278
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,839
- It's a very nice restaurant.
- Thanks.

279
00:40:39,553 --> 00:40:43,427
You're a police officer,
questioning is the nature of your business, isn't it? 

280
00:40:43,462 --> 00:40:47,489
Yeah. But my visit today is simply social.

281
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:52,329
- Why?
- Well, let's just say, I think you're very pretty.

282
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:56,172
- Thank you.
- Geez, where are my manners,

283
00:40:56,173 --> 00:41:01,630
I haven't even introduced myself.
My name is Joe, Joe Marshall. 

284
00:41:01,631 --> 00:41:06,121
- I know. And they call you samurai?
- It seems you know a lot about me? 

285
00:41:06,937 --> 00:41:10,337
- They talk.
- Who's they, your Japanese friends?

286
00:41:10,338 --> 00:41:14,838
- They're not my friends.
- Well, if they're not your friends,
then how did you get to know them?

287
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,677
I mean, do you know who they are, or where they came from? 

288
00:41:17,712 --> 00:41:22,708
Did you know that Fujiyama is the number one most wanted
criminal on the police list right now?

289
00:41:22,743 --> 00:41:25,495
Well, I don't know him well.
As far as I know, he's just a businessman.

290
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:27,360
And he's been helpful to my mother and I.

291
00:41:28,299 --> 00:41:32,299
- How did you get to know him in the first place? 
- My father passed away.

292
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:37,800
He owned this restaurant.
He left my mother and I buried under 400,000 dollars in debt. 

293
00:41:37,801 --> 00:41:43,801
So Mr. Fujiyama helped us out.
I guess, you could say, he owns the restaurant now. 

294
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:46,302
That's why my mother and I feel indebted to him.

295
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:49,303
You see, whatever he's done for you,
it doesn't mean anything.

296
00:41:49,304 --> 00:41:53,104
And the money that he spent on you
in this restaurant is drug money,

297
00:41:53,105 --> 00:41:54,405
dirty.

298
00:41:54,706 --> 00:41:58,406
You see, guys like Fujiyama make millions of dollars every year 

299
00:41:58,407 --> 00:42:00,707
in this town by selling drugs and destruction.

300
00:42:01,623 --> 00:42:04,623
And I don't know you too well, but...

301
00:42:04,624 --> 00:42:08,424
I think it's pretty safe to say that,
you shouldn't have any interest for what this guy is doing.

302
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:12,125
Well, you're right.
I have no interest at all in their activities.

303
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:17,363
Good. Well,

304
00:42:17,398 --> 00:42:20,220
I suppose being the restaurant owner,

305
00:42:20,255 --> 00:42:21,897
you must be here quite a bit?

306
00:42:21,932 --> 00:42:27,810
- Yeah, day and night, why? 
- How would you like to eat somewhere else for a change?

307
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:32,411
- With me.
- I'm sorry, I can't. I'm really busy. 

308
00:42:34,092 --> 00:42:37,592
Well, you're the boss.
Can't you get somebody else to do it?

309
00:42:37,893 --> 00:42:40,239
Not today.
My bookkeeper is coming by later. 

310
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:45,255
Okay, how about tomorrow?

311
00:42:48,737 --> 00:42:52,237
Tomorrow is Friday and that's one of our busiest days.

312
00:42:52,238 --> 00:42:54,738
All right, Sunday. Sunday it is.

313
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,300
Sunday, I go to church.
Besides, Sunday is my birthday.

314
00:42:59,601 --> 00:43:02,901
- Oh, Sunday is your birthday? Well, happy birthday.
- Thank you.

315
00:43:04,065 --> 00:43:07,365
- What church do you go to? 
- The Episcopal Church in Beverly Hills.

316
00:43:07,866 --> 00:43:11,066
Ah, the Episcopal Church.
That's very nice.

317
00:43:13,342 --> 00:43:16,042
- Well, it was nice meeting you, Jennifer.
- You too.

318
00:43:16,735 --> 00:43:19,135
- See you later.
- Bye.

319
00:43:41,564 --> 00:43:44,464
- Don't move!
- What are you going to do, shoot me?

320
00:43:44,465 --> 00:43:48,665
Maybe a little later.
Right now, I got orders to break both your legs.

321
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:50,366
Come on, let's go. Move.

322
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:00,002
Stay back, this guy is mine.

322
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Oh, my legs, my legs.

323
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:54,859
- Tell me, who hired you?
- I don't know.

324
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:58,860
- Tell me, who hired you to kill a cop?
- I swear, I don't know.

325
00:44:58,861 --> 00:45:02,161
Don't lie to me or I'll break your fucking wrist.
Now tell me!

326
00:45:02,162 --> 00:45:04,662
I can't, they'll kill me.

327
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:07,663
No, they won't.
I'll help you. 

328
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:12,430
Assaulting a police officer
with a deadly weapon will get you 15 years but if you tell me

329
00:45:12,431 --> 00:45:15,431
who hired you, I'll get them.

330
00:45:16,132 --> 00:45:19,132
- Okamura. Okamura sent me. 
- Which one is he?

331
00:45:22,292 --> 00:45:24,692
He's the big bald man.

332
00:45:30,554 --> 00:45:32,754
All right, I need his address.

333
00:45:32,755 --> 00:45:35,755
How do we know that this is the right house?

334
00:45:36,018 --> 00:45:40,718
If Okamura is here, then we'll arrest him.
Then we'll have a solid case against the Katana gang 

335
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:43,719
for hiring four assassins to kill a policeman. 

336
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:47,120
On the other hand, if it's the wrong house,
then we'll apologize to the owner, 

337
00:45:47,121 --> 00:45:48,121
the usual police routine.

338
00:45:48,611 --> 00:45:51,411
- Who's going to answer to Captain Roma on this?
- You.

339
00:45:52,088 --> 00:45:55,088
Shit, man.
He'll burn my ass. 

340
00:45:55,597 --> 00:45:58,797
You don't have to worry about that.
It's already-- 

341
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:03,098
Yeah, yeah, I know it's already black, huh?
This time, he'd probably cut my dick too, huh?

342
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:06,499
You better come to my house
before you report to the captain.

343
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,100
- For what?
- Let's use it before you lose it.

344
00:46:11,821 --> 00:46:15,221
All right guys, listen up.
Peggy, you and Johnson go around the front.

345
00:46:15,222 --> 00:46:17,222
Frank and I are going to go around the back.

346
00:46:17,223 --> 00:46:19,923
If you hear shooting, come running.
Let's go. 

347
00:46:25,343 --> 00:46:29,943
- Hey, preacher?
- Yeah?
- You and I got nothing to do.

348
00:46:29,944 --> 00:46:33,744
- Let's fuck.
- Shut up.

349
00:46:46,571 --> 00:46:47,571
Damn.

350
00:46:50,439 --> 00:46:53,439
But you promised to buy me those Japanese pearls. 

351
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,940
- Did I?
- Yes. You promised.

352
00:46:57,399 --> 00:47:00,149
- A favor is a favor.
- Okay.

353
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:02,900
Can you satisfy me?

354
00:47:17,257 --> 00:47:19,357
- Hey, take a look behind the building.
- All right.

355
00:47:29,418 --> 00:47:30,418
Freeze!

356
00:47:47,123 --> 00:47:50,123
- Do you hear something?
- No. Is that him?

357
00:47:50,124 --> 00:47:54,124
I guess so.
Looks like this is his last fuck.

358
00:47:54,125 --> 00:47:57,525
- Let him finish it then.
- The hell I will.

359
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:05,870
- Hey, look! 
- Police!
Don't move, you're under arrest!

360
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:11,854
- Johnny, get your gun. Quick!
- Hurry! That way!
- Cops are here! Get them off my back.

361
00:48:13,695 --> 00:48:14,995
Freeze, Okamura!

362
00:48:23,475 --> 00:48:24,475
Freeze!

363
00:49:57,915 --> 00:50:02,315
I'm unarmed.
You're going to shoot me or fight me like a man? 

364
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:15,500
He's under arrest.
Watch his arm, I might have broken it.

365
00:53:16,127 --> 00:53:17,527
Looks like you did.

366
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:25,701
You're under arrest.
Come on, get up, get up! 

367
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:45,388
Holy shit. 

368
00:53:46,603 --> 00:53:49,603
Well, this one is dead too.
Not captured alive. 

369
00:53:53,932 --> 00:53:58,532
We have some problems in the police department.
We have several new enemies.

370
00:53:59,623 --> 00:54:06,094
There's Captain Roma, Lieutenant Washington,
Andrew Johnson, Peggy Lee Thomas,

371
00:54:06,129 --> 00:54:09,724
and this kid they call the samurai cop,
Joe Marshall. 

372
00:54:11,109 --> 00:54:16,509
Most important, is Captain Roma.
We buy him, the others don't matter.

373
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:23,707
No way boss, no way.
I tried to set them all up on private business.

374
00:54:23,708 --> 00:54:26,181
They would be financially-secured
for the rest of their lives.

375
00:54:26,535 --> 00:54:28,835
It's a downhill situation.

376
00:54:30,219 --> 00:54:33,172
I say, if we cannot buy them, we kill them.

377
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:39,990
It is a most difficult situation.
If any of those guys are hurt,

378
00:54:39,991 --> 00:54:44,459
they would suspect us,
especially after Okamura's death.

379
00:54:53,353 --> 00:54:58,522
I have an idea.
Let's use an outside source.

380
00:54:59,566 --> 00:55:02,566
I'll call New York and we'll have them all wiped out.

381
00:55:06,786 --> 00:55:11,786
We cannot kill any of them now.
But we should punish them somehow.

382
00:55:13,784 --> 00:55:16,830
Call New York and get somebody to break both

383
00:55:16,831 --> 00:55:19,204
of those samurai cop's legs.

384
00:55:19,491 --> 00:55:23,549
- But don't you or your men get involved.
- It shall be done.

385
00:55:23,807 --> 00:55:26,807
Who could shoot this in a Mafia boss's house?

386
00:55:26,808 --> 00:55:28,808
One of his own men.

387
00:55:30,757 --> 00:55:35,457
Excuse me, where did the tall guy with the ponytail go? 

388
00:55:35,866 --> 00:55:39,566
- He is upstairs with my boss.
- Thank you.

389
00:55:50,129 --> 00:55:54,629
- Can I help you?
- Well, just a little business with him.

390
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,900
- Are you expecting anybody?
- No.

391
00:56:23,901 --> 00:56:26,701
That's the warning bell.

392
00:56:27,202 --> 00:56:30,002
Oh, yeah?
Wait here.

393
00:57:07,421 --> 00:57:08,421
Freeze!

394
00:58:35,977 --> 00:58:38,393
Yeah, boss?

395
00:58:39,228 --> 00:58:40,810
Are they there?

396
00:58:40,845 --> 00:58:42,578
I'll be there right away.

397
00:58:44,282 --> 00:58:46,582
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to a party.

398
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:21,671
- Hi, there.
- Oh, hi. You're going to church too? 

399
00:59:21,672 --> 00:59:24,272
Yeah. I was in there preaching, didn't you see me? 

400
00:59:24,273 --> 00:59:27,573
- No, you weren't. Stop kidding me.
- Nah, I'm just kidding.

401
00:59:31,453 --> 00:59:35,453
Hey, hold on.
I have to ask you some more questions. 

402
00:59:35,454 --> 00:59:40,054
- Police questions?
- Well, let's just say some questions.

403
00:59:42,674 --> 00:59:46,174
- Okay, where?
- In my car. Come on.

404
01:00:00,372 --> 01:00:03,972
So this is the police station where you're interrogating me?

405
01:00:03,973 --> 01:00:06,673
- This is the place.
- Is this your house?

406
01:00:06,974 --> 01:00:11,974
Yeah, I own it, month to month.
Come on, let me show you around.

407
01:00:18,017 --> 01:00:20,017
She left with the cop. 

408
01:00:26,811 --> 01:00:28,811
She left with the cop.

409
01:00:36,311 --> 01:00:40,011
- Kill him! 
- My pleasure.

409
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,500
-Wow!
-Ain't that perfect!
-Boy!

410
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:58,890
- It seems like you went to a lot of trouble.
- You know what, as a matter of fact, I did.

411
01:00:58,891 --> 01:01:03,591
This chicken, I have a neighbor next door,
and she has farm animals.

412
01:01:04,338 --> 01:01:08,138
And what I did was I jumped the fence,
I stole one of her chickens and then killed it.

413
01:01:08,139 --> 01:01:10,939
- Great.
- I mean because I really wanted to impress you.

414
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:16,140
- So I hope you're impressed.
- How did you know I'd come home with you?

415
01:01:18,303 --> 01:01:21,703
Let's just say, I can read eyes.

416
01:01:46,731 --> 01:01:48,931
- My God, oh my God!
- Come here, bitch.

417
01:01:48,932 --> 01:01:51,932
- What are you doing?
- Who the hell are you?

418
01:01:51,933 --> 01:01:56,133
- What the hell do you want?
- My husband, he's a police officer.
You can't do this to us.

419
01:01:56,134 --> 01:01:59,734
Yeah I know.
I want to know where your samurai friend is 

420
01:01:59,735 --> 01:02:04,535
- and I want to know now.
- I don't know. We're not good friends.

421
01:02:09,484 --> 01:02:13,192
John, John help me!
John do something.

422
01:02:14,115 --> 01:02:15,194
Leave her alone.

423
01:02:20,963 --> 01:02:22,841
Leave her alone, damn it!

424
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:27,054
Tell me where he is or I'll hack her throat
out piece by piece.

425
01:02:27,055 --> 01:02:30,755
- I swear, I don't know where he lives.
- Who knows?

426
01:02:30,756 --> 01:02:35,756
Well, please don't do anything foolish.
How about Frank or Peggy, the girl cop?

427
01:02:35,757 --> 01:02:40,073
- You lie.
- They're pretty good friends, maybe they know where he lives.

428
01:02:40,108 --> 01:02:44,390
Please don't hurt my wife.
Damn you!

429
01:02:44,391 --> 01:02:47,074
My God!
Oh my god!

430
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:06,206
This is Washington's address.
Chuck, you and your brother go there,

431
01:03:06,246 --> 01:03:08,861
we'll go to the policewoman's.

432
01:03:08,862 --> 01:03:11,964
He lives alone but sometimes,
his girlfriend is with him.

433
01:03:12,182 --> 01:03:15,563
- You know how I operate.
- We know boss.

433
01:03:15,564 --> 01:03:17,500
Good, good.

434
01:03:17,764 --> 01:03:20,364
- If you get the information,
you give it to me on the car phone.
- All right.

435
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:26,640
- Let's go.
- Sally! Sally!

435
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:33,700
Sally! Oh my God.

436
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,380
Surprise...

437
01:04:28,392 --> 01:04:32,392
- Who the hell are you? What do you want?
- I want information.

438
01:04:32,393 --> 01:04:36,571
What kind of information?
Want information about my butt?

439
01:04:36,615 --> 01:04:37,594
Sit down!

440
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:39,880
We'll shoot you.

441
01:04:41,439 --> 01:04:44,839
I'd love to put a bullet in your head.

441
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,200
Oh, yeah.

442
01:04:48,006 --> 01:04:52,406
Hey, hey take it easy man, come on.
Talk to me, what do you want? 

443
01:04:52,407 --> 01:04:56,807
I could kill you now or I can relieve you of this gift.

444
01:04:57,208 --> 01:05:02,200
This black gift.
In a split second you won't enjoy yourself
for the rest of your life. 

445
01:05:03,109 --> 01:05:09,109
- All I want is samurai's address. His address!
- It's over there in the closet.

446
01:05:10,518 --> 01:05:11,518
- Go get it.
- Yeah.

447
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:21,166
Ain't nothing here.

447
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:27,555
Ain't a damn thing in here.

448
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:33,952
Cop,

448
01:05:33,953 --> 01:05:35,353
ain't nothing here at all.

449
01:05:39,496 --> 01:05:41,196
Leave him alone!

450
01:05:41,797 --> 01:05:43,297
Leave him alone I said!

451
01:05:43,498 --> 01:05:46,498
Drop it!
Or I'll cut his throat!

452
01:05:46,816 --> 01:05:47,816
I said leave him alone.

453
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,600
Shoot him, shoot.

454
01:05:52,116 --> 01:05:53,016
Shoot him in the head.

454
01:05:53,017 --> 01:05:53,800
Leave him alone!

455
01:05:53,999 --> 01:05:54,900
He's dead.

455
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:07,050
You love cutting people, huh?
Now, you're going to get it. 

456
01:06:19,722 --> 01:06:22,102
Now that is real professional.

457
01:06:22,137 --> 01:06:23,381
- I thought so.
- No.

458
01:06:25,988 --> 01:06:27,388
Answer the phone.

458
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:34,800
Oh, God.

459
01:06:50,147 --> 01:06:52,447
- I'm hungry.
- Me too.

460
01:08:06,418 --> 01:08:08,118
Hey, baby.

461
01:08:24,626 --> 01:08:27,026
Get up! Hold her.

462
01:08:27,427 --> 01:08:29,027
Get up! 

463
01:08:32,247 --> 01:08:33,247
Hold her.

464
01:08:43,667 --> 01:08:45,667
This thing burns, you know.

465
01:08:45,668 --> 01:08:48,168
- Fuck you!
- Maybe some other time.

466
01:08:48,169 --> 01:08:51,369
Right now, I want to know where your samurai friend is.

467
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:53,370
I don't know.

468
01:08:56,207 --> 01:09:01,207
Maybe that will help you remember?
Now, you tell me where he his, I want his address now!

469
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:05,208
So foolish.

470
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:14,610
- No! No stop! You're burning me!
- Yes it burns and it's going to burn more.

471
01:09:15,111 --> 01:09:19,106
- Now, you tell me where he is. 
- No! No!

472
01:09:19,441 --> 01:09:25,392
He lives in Zuma Beach,
Number 35. 

473
01:09:28,938 --> 01:09:31,938
Thank you for you cooperation.

474
01:09:41,972 --> 01:09:47,372
Now, I'm going to burn that samurai lover of hers.
Cool down, young one.

475
01:09:56,529 --> 01:10:06,529
Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday dear, Jennifer, happy birthday to you. 

476
01:10:07,351 --> 01:10:10,830
- You thought of everything.
- Well, you can't have a birthday without a cake.

477
01:10:11,131 --> 01:10:13,331
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

478
01:13:22,036 --> 01:13:23,236
Come on, Joe.

479
01:13:30,123 --> 01:13:34,423
- Hello.
- Listen, get out of your house.
I mean fast. Get out fast, man.

480
01:13:34,424 --> 01:13:36,624
Those guys are looking for you.

481
01:13:37,396 --> 01:13:39,396
Oh, yeah? What happened?

482
01:13:56,195 --> 01:13:58,995
Come on. Just get out fast.
I'll explain later, okay?

483
01:13:58,996 --> 01:13:59,996
They're coming after you.

484
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:09,860
Looks like they're already here. Gotta go.

485
01:14:21,175 --> 01:14:22,175
Come on!

486
01:15:21,938 --> 01:15:24,138
Listen, don't worry.
Get back inside.

487
01:15:27,268 --> 01:15:30,468
You can run all you want,
but you'll never get away from me!

488
01:15:43,441 --> 01:15:44,441
Johnny, come on.

489
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:17,315
Hi, mom.

490
01:16:18,043 --> 01:16:20,774
Where the hell have you been?
I've been worried sick about you!

491
01:16:20,775 --> 01:16:24,239
- There's nothing to worry about.
- That's easy for you to say.

492
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:28,240
Mr. Fujiyama was very angry.
He made arrangements for you birthday.

493
01:16:28,241 --> 01:16:29,552
He got you presents.

494
01:16:29,553 --> 01:16:32,471
I don't care!
I don't want him to ever do anything for me again.

495
01:16:32,472 --> 01:16:35,641
What is the matter with you?
The man has been good to you.

496
01:16:35,643 --> 01:16:42,243
I don't give a damn!
And you know why? Because I'm in love.

497
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:52,554
I should fire the both of you.

498
01:16:52,555 --> 01:16:56,434
You never brought me one of those bastards in alive,
so I can nail him with something.

499
01:16:57,709 --> 01:17:00,854
And because of you, I'm about to be fired.

500
01:17:00,855 --> 01:17:04,025
I'm going to lose my pension.
That means my future is gone.

501
01:17:04,988 --> 01:17:08,405
But you know something?
I don't give a fuck!

502
01:17:08,608 --> 01:17:14,240
There's only one thing in this world I want.
I want you to find
that mother-fucking Japanese gangster! 

503
01:17:14,241 --> 01:17:16,699
I want you to kill him, and I want you
to kill every one of his men. 

504
01:17:17,041 --> 01:17:21,334
I want you to burn this house in bloodbath!
Don't leave anybody alive! 

505
01:17:21,411 --> 01:17:27,911
And when they're all dead, you come back to me
and all three of us will turn our badges in.

506
01:17:27,912 --> 01:17:32,212
So if I do it, we'll be off this police force for good.

507
01:17:34,157 --> 01:17:36,457
- Now you're talking. 
- All right.

508
01:17:37,306 --> 01:17:40,906
- See you, captain. 
- See you in hell.

509
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:42,991
Let's go, Frank.

510
01:18:19,834 --> 01:18:23,234
- Why did you come under? 
- 'Cause I'm an undercover cop.

510
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:26,500
Come on.

511
01:18:59,087 --> 01:19:01,587
- They're here, boss.
- Where's the girl? 

512
01:19:01,588 --> 01:19:04,088
- She's down in the basement.
- The mother?

513
01:19:04,089 --> 01:19:07,089
- They kept her in the villa.  
- Use it. Finish him!

513
01:19:07,090 --> 01:19:08,000
Okay, boss.

514
01:19:15,466 --> 01:19:17,666
- Go watch the other door!
- Okay, boss.

515
01:19:26,997 --> 01:19:28,397
We're behind you, get back!

516
01:19:49,564 --> 01:19:50,564
Drop it.

517
01:21:44,291 --> 01:21:48,291
All right Samurai, drop your gun
or your sweetheart will be dead.

518
01:21:50,248 --> 01:21:52,648
All I want to do is get out of this country.

519
01:21:56,618 --> 01:22:00,118
- I thought you were fond of her?
- Yes I was before you came in.

520
01:22:01,206 --> 01:22:04,806
Now that she loves you,
you'd have to worry about her life, not me.

521
01:22:05,107 --> 01:22:06,607
Neither do I.

522
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:12,220
Drop it.

523
01:22:15,027 --> 01:22:18,027
- Drop it or I'll shoot you. 
- Take it easy, Frank. 

524
01:22:18,028 --> 01:22:21,428
Go ahead and shoot.
Her head will be blown off before I go down. 

525
01:22:22,577 --> 01:22:24,740
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute, hold on.

526
01:22:25,503 --> 01:22:28,680
How do I know if I drop my gun you won't shoot me? 

527
01:22:28,761 --> 01:22:31,478
Well, for one thing,
I don't want any more trouble with the police.

528
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:35,379
Bullshit.
The minute we disarm, he's going to shoot. 

529
01:22:47,598 --> 01:22:51,598
Drop the gun Frank.
I don't want Jennifer hurt.

530
01:22:52,099 --> 01:22:56,599
He's not stupid.
He doesn't want to do the killing himself. 

531
01:22:58,251 --> 01:23:00,451
Go ahead and drop it Frank.

532
01:23:07,931 --> 01:23:10,931
You American cops aren't as smart as I thought you were.

533
01:23:10,932 --> 01:23:13,932
Your cinnamon always gets in the way of your intelligence. 

534
01:23:26,198 --> 01:23:28,898
- It's your turn now cop. Say sayonara.
- No!

535
01:23:34,453 --> 01:23:36,653
- Frank, are you all right, man? 
- Yeah.

536
01:23:41,283 --> 01:23:45,934
Well, he was smart in every way except one thing. 

537
01:23:45,969 --> 01:23:49,420
- What's that? 
- With all his money and success,

538
01:23:49,455 --> 01:23:51,577
he's not as smart as I am. 

539
01:23:52,765 --> 01:23:55,970
- To do what? 
- Put on a bulletproof vest, man. 

540
01:23:56,850 --> 01:24:00,850
- Let's go home. 
- I've got one more thing to take care of. 

541
01:24:00,991 --> 01:24:05,791
- What? 
- Yamashita. He's still alive.

541
01:24:05,792 -->01:24:06,792
Oh, God.

542
01:24:21,509 --> 01:24:24,009
- Hey, come on. It's lunch time.
- Gonna be ready!

543
01:25:07,948 --> 01:25:11,548
- Look out, Joe.
- Don't worry.

544
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:16,720
God damn it.

545
01:25:33,069 --> 01:25:36,369
Hey guys, the cops are here.
Come on, come on guys!

546
01:27:47,332 --> 01:27:48,332
Come on.

547
01:27:55,746 --> 01:27:59,146
- Yamashita is here. Watch out. 
- Let's split up. 

548
01:28:56,901 --> 01:28:58,396
Go get my sword.

549
01:28:58,397 --> 01:28:59,376
Hey Joe.

550
01:28:59,411 --> 01:29:01,689
So they call you Samurai? 

551
01:29:01,690 --> 01:29:05,681
Let's see how good you are with a sword,
samurai super cop.

552
01:29:13,739 --> 01:29:15,539
Come on, try me. 

553
01:32:31,428 --> 01:32:35,782
You lost.
You lost face.

554
01:32:42,626 --> 01:32:48,100
You know the code of the Bushita?
Kill me. 

555
01:33:08,995 --> 01:33:10,995
No Joe, you're a cop! 

556
01:33:27,644 --> 01:33:29,244
What is he doing? 

557
01:33:29,578 --> 01:33:35,316
No. Leave him alone. He's a samurai. 

558
01:33:35,351 --> 01:33:38,249
He wants to die with honor.
