A lot of people get it
at that age,

273
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:35,239

274
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:37,441
I was in bed for almost a month

275
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:43,181

was really swollen.

but it was huge.

The swelling just would
not go down

278
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:56,327
and I remember,
after about two weeks of it,

279
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:59,096
I honestly couldn't recall
what it had been like

280
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:02,333

282
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:08,105
Of course, two weeks later,
I was fine

283
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:10,675

what it had been like

284
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:13,144
to feel so sick,

285
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:16,847

I've been waiting

289
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:32,830
to feel healthy again...

290
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:40,771

308
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,076

that you would care

309
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:54,912
to share with us about
how you're feeling or?

310

to sound...

but this whole process,

312
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:06,557
I think I'm at
a different stage or...

313
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,995
Well, the Kubler Ross Model

314
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:14,565

to act as a loose framework

accounting for everything

316
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,771
from the grief of losing
a loved one

317
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:24,809
to the grief of somebody
who's dying himself.

318
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,682
Is there a difference?

319
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,217
Um...

320
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,155

326
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:06,650
I don't know.

327
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:08,152

- You don't say?

331
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:19,997
No, no, it's not that,
I've just...

332
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:24,201
I've found that in
trying to deal with this,

333
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:26,470
the more bad habits
you can avoid,

334
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:29,740
the better you'll feel.

335
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,809
Has that worked for you?

336
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:37,014
I'm still waiting
for it to kick in.

337
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,853

I just needed

338

something to focus my energy on.

339
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,690
And of all the things
you could've chosen,

340
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:48,225
you picked cigarettes?

341
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:50,561
Well, it was this
or learning guitar

342
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:52,763
and nobody wants that.

343
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,498
No, just this and running.

344
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,933

345

346

545
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:55,752
It was a while ago, I think.

546
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,425
You okay?

547
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:04,060
Yeah.

548
00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:05,795
I just didn't know that.

549
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,201
My brother's over there.

550
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:17,340
Really, how long
has he been there?

551
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,442
Well, he did two tours already
and then he was home

552
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:21,678
for about a year,
thought he was done,

553
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,382
but then in December,
he went back.

554
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:26,750
That must be hard.

555
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,985
Yeah, not only because
he's over there,

556
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:32,789
but because, you know,
he's not here

557
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:39,029
and he's the one person
I really wish was right now.

558
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:42,299
I feel that way about
my mom sometimes.

559
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:47,504
She died a long time ago, don't,
and it wasn't unexpected.

560
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:50,840
It's strange how
different they are.

561
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:53,210
I mean, the long, drawn out kind

562
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:58,615
is its own type of animal,
but when it's sudden...

563
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,619
Well, I mean, you know.

564
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:07,157
Which one's worse?

565
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:15,799
Um, I'm sorry.

566
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,604
(beep)

567
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:22,939
Hello, I just wanted to let you
know that I've hired

568
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:25,408
a private detective
to look at your whereabouts.

569
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,878
Had to take a second job,
but hey, you're worth it.

570
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,814
Be on the lookout for
a guy driving a Ferrari,

571
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:33,750
wears a Hawaiian shirt,
has a killer mustache.

572
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,252
Seriously, Rach,
please call me back.

573
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:37,020
There's something I
want to talk to you about.

574
00:37:37,022 --> 00:37:38,388
(beep)

575
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,156
Eric, it's Melissa.

576
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:42,892
This is getting a
little crazy here.

577
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:45,061
It would be really good
if you would call me back

578
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:46,663
one of these days.

579
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:49,232
Sooner rather than later.

580
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:50,700
I'm moving, Eric.

581
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:53,169
I'll be gone at
the end of May, so.

582
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:55,605
We're running out of time here.

583
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,173
Please call me.

584
00:37:57,175 --> 00:38:00,844
Soon.

585
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:05,715
Well, the good news is
it's nothing to worry about.

586
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:09,386
- That's good.
- Yes, but these aren't moles.

587
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:13,790
They're called mollusca,
now, pull down your pants.

588
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:14,891
Um.

589
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:17,394
Come on.

590
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:19,162
Oh, yeah.

591
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:20,664
Yeah, you have a lot
of little ones

592
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,899
running down the inside
of your thighs.

593
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:24,934
Looks like a couple
on the penis.

594
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:26,102
I do?

595
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:29,906
They're small, so
they're harder to spot.

596
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:32,175
Well, what did you say
they're called?

597
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:34,144
Molluscum contagiosum.

598
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:36,479
It's a virus that's transmitted
by sexual contact

599
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:40,617
that produces these painless
little papules all over.

600
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,018
I'm sorry.

601
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:45,221
Is this an STD?

602
00:38:45,223 --> 00:38:48,625
Well, technically,
in your case, yes.

603
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:50,960
The vast majority of adults
contract it from

604
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:52,929
skin to skin contact
during intercourse

605
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:56,199
and judging from the location
of the papules,

606
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:59,602
it's pretty clear
that's where you acquired it,

607
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:02,072
but not to worry.

608
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:05,875
Unlike herpes or HPV,
once the initial symptoms

609
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:08,511
clear up, they don't come back.

610
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:11,214
Now, uh,
are you sexually active now?

611
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,850
No.

612
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,653
When was the last time you were?

613
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:19,489
About two months ago.

614
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:22,625
Or more like three, I guess.

615
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:25,295
Well, these guys sometimes
take a little while to show up

616
00:39:25,297 --> 00:39:26,930
and when they do,
people tend to ignore them

617
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:28,998
since they don't hurt.

618
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,335
Now, I'm going to give
you a cream to apply

619
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:35,105
directly to the penis at home

620
00:39:35,107 --> 00:39:37,807
and then, we'll freeze off
the ones in the surrounding

621
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:40,910
areas every two weeks or so.

622
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:43,847
How long did you say
the incubation period is?

623
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:47,784
Between two and twelve
weeks from exposure.

624
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:51,454
That's it?

625
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:52,889
All right.

626
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,357
Now, just lie back.

When did you know
you wanted to marry him?

655
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,604
Sometime during my senior year.

656
00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:23,673
- Oh, God.
- What?

657
00:42:23,675 --> 00:42:26,643
Nothing, it's just all
I was focused on senior year

658
00:42:26,645 --> 00:42:28,778
of college was fast food
and keg stands.

659
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,481
- Well, so was I.
- Mhm.

660
00:42:31,483 --> 00:42:34,651
Hey, I wasn't born
a second grade teacher.

661
00:42:34,653 --> 00:42:36,352
Oh, okay, well, what about you?

662
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:38,288
Haven't you ever thought you
would marry someone you dated?

663
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:41,124
I mean, didn't you think
you might marry Gretchen?

664
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:49,799
She's the first person I'd ever
even thought about it with.

665
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:52,468
Before that, I don't know.

666
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,637
I just never really saw it
happening with anyone

667
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:59,909
but with her,
it just seemed to make sense.

668
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:08,117
I'd actually started
saving up for a rock.

669
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:11,087
- Really?
- Yeah, well, not a rock.

670
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,189
More like a pebble,
student loans kind of put

671
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:15,458
a damper on the diamond fund.

672
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,194
Why did you drop
out of business school?

673
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:19,662
Technically,
I haven't dropped out.

674
00:43:19,664 --> 00:43:21,931
Thank you very much,
I've simply deferred

675
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,566
my matriculated studies.

676
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:26,736
Okay, well, why did you do that?

677
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:31,274
I don't know, I've been working
in non profit for a few years

678
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:36,346
and it was pretty great,
but it's not exactly lucrative.

679
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:41,784
I just thought getting
an MBA would show initiative

680
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:43,987
and show that
I was serious about her.

681
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:50,326
Then, after, you know...

682
00:43:50,328 --> 00:43:51,828
I don't know, I guess
I just didn't know

683
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:54,330
why I was there anymore.

684
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:02,071
What?

685
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:05,541
Sorry, I don't know, I just...

686
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:08,511
It just seems like you
did a lot for her.

687
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:14,350
I don't know.

688
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:16,886
Never really felt like enough.

689
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:26,362
- Hey, easy with the flipping.
- What?

690
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:27,730
You're only supposed
to flip them once

691
00:44:27,732 --> 00:44:30,867
otherwise, they get dried out.

692
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:33,336
Sorry, I didn't realize
I had the charbroiling queen

693
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:35,905
of Sag Harbor right
here in my backyard.

694
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:38,474
Well, now you know.

695
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:46,649
Hey, did you ever worry
about Bobby, you know...

696
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:48,851
What?

697
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:49,952
Never mind.

698
00:44:49,954 --> 00:44:54,457
Never mind.

699
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:56,592
Being unfaithful?

700
00:44:56,594 --> 00:44:59,228
How'd you go from
grilling techniques to that?

701
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:02,965
What, you don't see the segue?

702
00:45:02,967 --> 00:45:04,267
I'm not saying that he was.

703
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:08,071
I'm just curious if... you know.

704
00:45:08,073 --> 00:45:10,773
I don't know, never mind.

705
00:45:10,775 --> 00:45:12,442
I never worried about it really.

706
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:19,148
It crossed my mind
once or twice.

707
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:22,085
At our first homecoming,
after college,

708
00:45:22,087 --> 00:45:24,921
we were saying hi
to all these people

709
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:27,490
we hadn't seen since graduation

710
00:45:27,492 --> 00:45:32,628
and there was this girl.

711
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:35,398
She had been a couple years
behind Bobby and me

712
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,067
and she lived across the hall
from him our senior year

713
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:39,535
and she and her friends
were always hanging

714
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:44,407
around his place
and I don't know, I just...

715
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:49,312
I always thought she had
a thing for him, you know?

716
00:45:49,314 --> 00:45:54,117
Anyway,
when we saw her that day,

717
00:45:54,119 --> 00:46:00,056
she gave Bobby a hug
and she gave me this look.

718
00:46:00,058 --> 00:46:01,424
I don't know,
it's just this look

719
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:05,294
like she had
something on me, you know?

720
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:11,701
That was the only time really.

721
00:46:11,703 --> 00:46:13,603
Did you ask him about it?

722
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:15,438
About a look?

723
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,506
(mumbles)

724
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,776
Yeah, I just...
it was just probably

725
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:21,511
all in my head.

726
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:24,680
Why'd you ask me that?

727
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:31,621
What's up, dudes?

728
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:32,755
Hey handsome.

729
00:46:32,757 --> 00:46:33,923
Tony, this is Rachel.

730
00:46:33,925 --> 00:46:35,358
Rachel, this is my son, Tony.

731
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,560
I adopted him last month.

732
00:46:37,562 --> 00:46:38,494
Hey, how are you?

733
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:39,629
Hi.

734
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:41,197
I thought you were
playing ball tonight?

735
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:42,965
There's some event
going on at the gym

736
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,834
so we got pushed back an hour.

737
00:46:44,836 --> 00:46:46,002
Fuckin' kids.

738
00:46:46,004 --> 00:46:47,703
Ugh, the worst.

739
00:46:47,705 --> 00:46:48,938
What about you guys?

740
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,473
Little Sunday night
burger action?

741
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:52,842
More like hockey pucks
if this guy has his way.

743

Um, is there a bathroom
I can use?

744
00:46:57,282 --> 00:46:59,982
Yes, upstairs
and through the kitchen.

745
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:02,251
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

746
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:03,519
Remember what I said.

747
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:05,721
Yeah, yeah.

skin is my thing.

what it could be?

845
00:53:40,818 --> 00:53:42,284

it could be a break,

846
00:53:42,286 --> 00:53:44,086
a tear, a sprain, anything.

853

00:54:06,811 --> 00:54:08,143

864
00:54:08,145 --> 00:54:09,378
can head over there now

865
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:12,214

871
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:34,670

00:54:34,672 --> 00:54:35,604
and they just brought him up.

873
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:36,839

874
00:54:36,841 --> 00:54:38,207
What do you mean
I'm not a scout?

875
00:54:38,209 --> 00:54:39,541

876
00:54:39,543 --> 00:54:41,076
You work in the
financial district.

877

885

Called a foot cast, dummy.

886

For who, Paul Bunyan?

887
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:02,364
I'm just kidding man,
you can hardly notice it.

888
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:03,999
Well, why are you wearing it?

889
00:55:04,001 --> 00:55:07,202
Because apparently,
I have a stress fracture.

890
00:55:07,204 --> 00:55:08,204
A stress fracture?

891
00:55:08,205 --> 00:55:09,205
What the hell is that?

892
00:55:09,206 --> 00:55:10,139
Is it from all your stress?

893
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:11,440
Give me those shoulders.

894
00:55:11,442 --> 00:55:12,941
What are you doing
to yourself, buddy?

895
00:55:12,943 --> 00:55:14,343
Doctor says, it's brought on by

896
00:55:14,345 --> 00:55:15,878
an excessive amount of exercise.

897
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:16,945
Apparently,
if I don't wear this,

898
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:18,447
I might wind up needing surgery.

899
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:19,915
Jesus.

900
00:55:19,917 --> 00:55:22,017
How long do you
have to wear it for?

901
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:23,419
Three to six weeks.

902
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:25,921
Sounds like your body's
telling you to ease up, man.

903
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:28,123
Maybe give yourself a break.

904
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:29,191
Excuse me, ma'am.

905
00:55:29,193 --> 00:55:31,593

906
00:55:31,595 --> 00:55:33,495
His bones haven't
formed yet actually.

907
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:35,030
Very brittle.

912

I have to leave this

913
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,541
on your machine
like I'm, I don't know,

917
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:54,083
I wanted to tell you
on the phone,

918
00:55:54,085 --> 00:55:56,552
if not in person, but I just...

919

You're getting married?

920

Ha!

921
00:55:59,357 --> 00:56:00,189
She lives.

922

923

Oh, my God!

924
00:56:03,194 --> 00:56:04,893

Sorry, has everyone

No, you're the first one.

I can't even be annoyed
because I started the trend.

934
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:48,704
I got married first
and they all came to my wedding

935
00:56:48,706 --> 00:56:50,305
and then,
I skipped all of theirs.

936
00:56:50,307 --> 00:56:51,740
Why?

937
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:55,344
They weren't just my friends
and to them,

938
00:56:55,346 --> 00:56:57,613
it's like everything
from before Bobby died,

939
00:56:57,615 --> 00:56:59,381
never happened,
like the person I was

940
00:56:59,383 --> 00:57:01,683
doesn't even exist anymore.

941
00:57:01,685 --> 00:57:04,119
Does she?

942
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:08,123
That can't be the only thing
that defines who I am.

943
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:09,258
It can't be.

944
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,994
But, Carrie,
she is such a good friend.

945
00:57:11,996 --> 00:57:13,996
So, tell her how you feel.

946
00:57:13,998 --> 00:57:15,931
How do you tell someone
that you've been good friends

947
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:17,800
with for 10 years
who has never done a bad thing

948
00:57:17,802 --> 00:57:20,202
to you in her life
that you've avoided hanging out

949
00:57:20,204 --> 00:57:22,905
with her because you're afraid
it will make you feel weird.

950
00:57:22,907 --> 00:57:24,139
Well, I could tell her for you.

951
00:57:24,141 --> 00:57:25,741
I mean,
if you give me her number,

952
00:57:25,743 --> 00:57:28,310
I will straighten
that girl out right quick.

953
00:57:28,312 --> 00:57:29,678

954
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,046
When's the wedding anyway?

955
00:57:31,048 --> 00:57:31,947
October.

956
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:33,749
Oh, do you have to go?

957
00:57:33,751 --> 00:57:36,952
Well, she asked me
to be her maid of honor.

958
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:39,087
Well, maybe you
could compromise?

959
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:42,090
Maybe you could DJ or valet,
can you drive a stick?

960
00:57:42,092 --> 00:57:43,592
You're a huge help
you know that?

961
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:44,960
Okay, okay.

962
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:46,995
I mean, October
is like five months away.

963
00:57:46,997 --> 00:57:49,965
It's plenty of time
to mentally prepare yourself.

964
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:54,102
Actually, I kind of
offered to have them

965
00:57:54,104 --> 00:57:56,338
and a few other people
over to my place

966
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:59,741
next week to celebrate
their engagement.

967
00:57:59,743 --> 00:58:01,043
Well, that was nice of you.

968
00:58:01,045 --> 00:58:03,278
Yeah, well, you know,
it seems selfish

969
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,947
to have a place on the water
and never let

970
00:58:04,949 --> 00:58:06,882
your friends take advantage.

971
00:58:06,884 --> 00:58:08,717
Plus this way,
if you lose your shit

972
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:11,386
and you burn the place down,
at least you're insured.

973
00:58:11,388 --> 00:58:14,756
Yeah.

974
00:58:14,758 --> 00:58:17,493
It's actually next Sunday.

975
00:58:17,495 --> 00:58:19,094
So, I won't be at the meeting.

976
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:24,766
Well, Jules will be crushed,
but I'll break it to her gently.

977
00:58:24,768 --> 00:58:27,803
Do you need any... any help?

978
00:58:27,805 --> 00:58:30,072
Any backup?

979
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:36,778
I think I'm okay.

980
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,448
Well, okay.

981
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:43,085
Cool.

982
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,825
Hey, man, where you...

983
00:58:49,827 --> 00:58:52,427
(horn honks)

984
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,597
Where you coming from?

985
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:56,965
Just out.

986
00:58:56,967 --> 00:58:58,767
With your friend Rachel?

987
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:00,302
Yeah.

988
00:59:00,304 --> 00:59:02,604
Yeah, I meant to tell you
she stopped by yesterday.

989
00:59:02,606 --> 00:59:03,972
- Okay.
- Yeah but she said

990
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:09,111
she'd just see you tonight
at the meeting.

991
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:16,818
Eric.

992
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:23,325
Eric, look.

993
00:59:23,327 --> 00:59:25,027
What are you going
through my stuff now?

994
00:59:25,029 --> 00:59:26,762
I'm worried about you.

995
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:27,829
Look, I'm not judging you

996
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:29,231
for going to this thing.

997
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:31,934
- Maybe it was helpful for you.
- Tony.

998
00:59:31,936 --> 00:59:33,635
But this girl, Eric,
this whole thing,

999
00:59:33,637 --> 00:59:37,573
you gotta to be careful here.

1000
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:40,042
Don't be like Gretchen, man.

1001
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:43,645
You know,
everyone always thought

1002
00:59:43,647 --> 00:59:45,347
she was hot shit.

1003
00:59:45,349 --> 00:59:47,282
Pretty and funny
and whatever else

1004
00:59:47,284 --> 00:59:50,185
but what I mostly saw
was a girl who did

1005
00:59:50,187 --> 00:59:52,788
whatever she wanted
whenever she wanted

1006
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:54,656
regardless of how it
ever made you feel.

1007
00:59:54,658 --> 00:59:58,427
Whatever made her happy
was what always came first

1008
00:59:58,429 --> 01:00:00,362
and you know what,
somewhere along the line

1009
01:00:00,364 --> 01:00:02,831
you started believing
that was okay.

1010
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:04,333
You bought
right the fuck in, man.

1011
01:00:04,335 --> 01:00:06,535
You put aside everything
that was important to you

1012
01:00:06,537 --> 01:00:08,270
and you started trying
to fit into this mold

1013
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:09,738
of what you thought
she wanted you to be

1014
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,840
and she let you do that.

1015
01:00:11,842 --> 01:00:15,410
So, what am I supposed to think?

1016
01:00:15,412 --> 01:00:19,081
And now this whole thing
with this girl.

1017
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:21,049
Eric...

1018
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:26,288

01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:37,979
Yeah, just charge these
to the room, please?

1085
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:40,182
- Oh, you got it.
- Okay, so,

1086
01:03:40,184 --> 01:03:42,050
you're not there anymore though?

1087
01:03:42,052 --> 01:03:43,885
No, helping low income families

1088
01:03:43,887 --> 01:03:45,554
just seems so shallow, you know?

1089
01:03:45,556 --> 01:03:46,621
Yeah, totally.

1090
01:03:46,623 --> 01:03:48,056
So I went
to business school instead

1091
01:03:48,058 --> 01:03:49,991
because the world needs
sell outs right?

1092
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:51,326
(laughing)

1093
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:53,295
I don't think it's selling out.

1094
01:03:53,297 --> 01:03:54,629
I mean, it's not like

1095
01:03:54,631 --> 01:03:56,965
business and non profit
are mutually exclusive.

1096
01:03:56,967 --> 01:03:57,999
Yeah, totally.

1097
01:03:58,001 --> 01:03:59,434
Like, my cousin went to Stern,

1098
01:03:59,436 --> 01:04:01,570
and now she works for this NGO
where she helps

1099
01:04:01,572 --> 01:04:04,005
small business owners
in developing countries.

1100
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:05,140
Wow.

1101
01:04:05,142 --> 01:04:07,475
She sounds like a real bitch.

1102
01:04:07,477 --> 01:04:09,711
(laughing)

1103
01:04:09,713 --> 01:04:10,779
Wow.

1104
01:04:10,781 --> 01:04:14,583
(laughing)

1105
01:04:14,585 --> 01:04:15,951
It was a joke.

1106
01:04:15,953 --> 01:04:17,853
(laughing)

1107
01:04:17,855 --> 01:04:18,987
Hi.

1108
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:21,356
Excuse me.

1109
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:28,163
Okay, so we are stuck
in this airport in Houston

1110
01:04:28,165 --> 01:04:31,132
on like a two hour layover
and Rachel is running

1111
01:04:31,134 --> 01:04:33,435
into the bathroom
like every 30 seconds.

1112
01:04:33,437 --> 01:04:35,470
Hey, I'm standing right here.

1113
01:04:35,472 --> 01:04:37,172
Because this one
thought it was okay

1114
01:04:37,174 --> 01:04:40,308
to drink the water in Cancun
but not bathe in it.

1115
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:42,811
Okay, I see,
Carrie wants to have story time.

1116
01:04:42,813 --> 01:04:44,145
Okay, okay.

1117
01:04:44,147 --> 01:04:46,214
I digress, my lips are sealed.

1118
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:49,351
♪ Keep coming back for more

1119
01:04:49,353 --> 01:04:51,753
It was hilarious,
when we get back to New York

1120
01:04:51,755 --> 01:04:53,622
and Dr. Rice picked us up
at the airport,

1121
01:04:53,624 --> 01:04:56,958
he looks like he wants
to have Rachel quarantined.

1122
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,827
- Dr. Rice?
- Yeah, Rachel's dad.

1123
01:04:58,829 --> 01:05:00,228
He's the sweetest.

1124
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:02,063
He treated me for psoriasis
a few years ago.

1125
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:03,164
It was really gross.

1126
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:04,065
Thank God for doctor/patient

1127
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:06,401
confidentiality, right?

1128
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:10,205
(yelling)

1129
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:15,410
This was supposed
to be your thing, man!

1130
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:17,045
Was this not supposed
to be your thing?

1131
01:05:17,047 --> 01:05:18,346
No kidding, you just got beat

1132
01:05:18,348 --> 01:05:19,714
by a couple of old ladies.

1133
01:05:19,716 --> 01:05:21,583
Oh, my Lord.

1134
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:23,184
Jimmy, it's
a long train ride home,

1135
01:05:23,186 --> 01:05:24,486
you better think about what
you've done.

1136
01:05:24,488 --> 01:05:27,222
Chin chin.

1137
01:05:27,224 --> 01:05:29,357
Speaking of which,
it's time for us to go.

1138
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:30,959
- Boo!
- Oh, I know, I'm lame.

1139
01:05:30,961 --> 01:05:32,694
Would you let me help
you clean up before we go?

1140
01:05:32,696 --> 01:05:34,429
Oh, no, no, no, I got it,
you just catch your train.

1141
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:35,431
- No.
- Oh, come on.

1142
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:36,831
This is a lot of shit here.

1143
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:38,233
Are you sure?

1144
01:05:38,235 --> 01:05:39,901
Is there another train
after this one, or?

1145
01:05:39,903 --> 01:05:41,736
I think the last was 8:43.

1146
01:05:41,738 --> 01:05:43,605
All right, well, you guys go
and I'll help clean up

1147
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:45,674
and catch the next train
after this.

1148
01:05:45,676 --> 01:05:47,976
- Yeah.
- That's good for me.

1149
01:05:47,978 --> 01:05:49,244
All right, cool.

1150
01:05:49,246 --> 01:05:51,813
Well, it was so,
so nice meeting you.

1151
01:05:51,815 --> 01:05:52,814
It was nice to meet you too

1152
01:05:52,816 --> 01:05:54,416

1153
01:05:54,418 --> 01:05:57,152

- Thanks.

It's okay.

Two years, God!

1237
01:14:21,257 --> 01:14:24,859
I know.

1238
01:14:24,861 --> 01:14:29,297
And now, there's...
there's this guy.

1239
01:14:29,299 --> 01:14:32,333
He's a part of that group
I go to sometimes.

1240
01:14:32,335 --> 01:14:34,168
Right?

1241
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:38,739
We've become friends
and I just...

1242
01:14:38,741 --> 01:14:40,908
I don't know, does it...

1243
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:42,877
Does it ever go away?

I don't know, Rachel,
but it'll be different.

1247
01:14:58,595 --> 01:14:59,795
I feel like I might be getting

1248
01:14:59,796 --> 01:15:00,962
a little bit better I just go

1249
01:15:00,964 --> 01:15:02,697

01:15:02,699 --> 01:15:03,865

1251
01:15:03,867 --> 01:15:05,099
That's not true.

1252
01:15:05,101 --> 01:15:08,302

the first six months?

1253
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:12,607
Yeah.

01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:21,115

Actually, I'm thinking
about finding a new place.

Neighborhood's a bit
of a ghost town for me.

1269
01:16:06,428 --> 01:16:09,797
Have any plans for the summer?

1270
01:16:09,799 --> 01:16:11,432
You know, not really.

1271

1273

Every summer I make a lot
of big plans, you know?

Whether or not they happen.

1275
01:16:20,877 --> 01:16:23,277
Yeah, I know what you mean.

Hey sweetie.

01:20:34,864 --> 01:20:36,363
Hi.

1344
01:20:36,365 --> 01:20:38,065
Here they are.

1345
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:40,534
Thank you, thank you.

01:20:40,536 --> 01:20:42,002
Um.

1347
01:20:42,004 --> 01:20:45,706
So, I guess
you already know Eric Battie?

1348
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:47,107
Yes, indeed I do.

1349
01:20:47,109 --> 01:20:50,578
Eric and I, uh...

1350
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:53,547
We both used to go
to that group together.

1351
01:20:53,549 --> 01:20:56,750
Ah, oh.

1352
01:20:56,752 --> 01:20:58,419
Oh.

1353
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:02,456
Well, I have someone waiting.

1354
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:03,858
- Okay.
- Have fun, sweetie.

1355
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:06,260
Thanks.

1356
01:21:10,432 --> 01:21:12,566
Any plans?

1357
01:21:12,568 --> 01:21:14,802
Another wedding.

1358
01:21:14,804 --> 01:21:17,104
Have you been going to the...

1359
01:21:17,106 --> 01:21:19,173
Yeah, me neither, obviously.

1360
01:21:19,175 --> 01:21:21,141
Well, I mean, don't worry.

1361
01:21:21,143 --> 01:21:22,676
No one knows about it.

1362
01:21:22,678 --> 01:21:26,647
I didn't belong there
to begin with.

1363
01:21:26,649 --> 01:21:31,252
Besides, I'm actually
moving back downtown.

1364
01:21:31,254 --> 01:21:32,753
When?

1365
01:21:32,755 --> 01:21:33,988
Today.

1366
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:35,689
Yeah, I think it's more my speed

1367
01:21:35,691 --> 01:21:38,659
and plus it's closer to school.

1368
01:21:38,661 --> 01:21:40,761
Oh, so you decided to go back?

1369
01:21:40,763 --> 01:21:44,798
Yeah, figured I'd give it
another shot.

1370
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:50,604
Well, um, good luck with that.

1371
01:21:50,606 --> 01:21:52,106
Thanks.

1372
01:21:57,479 --> 01:21:59,747
Enjoy the wedding.

1373
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:08,322
Did you talk to her?

1374
01:22:15,864 --> 01:22:19,667
What did she have to say?

1375
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:24,571
Doesn't matter.

1376
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,275
Anyway, she took off again, so.

1377
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:30,110
- She did?
- Yeah, she was just in town

1378
01:22:30,112 --> 01:22:31,912
picking up the rest
of her stuff.

1379
01:22:31,914 --> 01:22:35,783
She's back in Oregon for good.

1380
01:22:35,785 --> 01:22:38,218
Did you say anything to her?

1381
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:44,358
Yeah, I told her to find
a good dermatologist.

1382
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:46,393
Well, I'm gonna go.

1383
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:50,431
It was good seeing you again.

Oh.

1390
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:47,654

01:23:47,656 --> 01:23:49,823

I just...
I couldn't shake it.

1395
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:07,741
I couldn't shake the feeling
that someone had died.

1396
01:24:07,743 --> 01:24:14,348

but I was wrong about who.
