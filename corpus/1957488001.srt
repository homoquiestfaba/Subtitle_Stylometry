1
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:49,189
Hey!

2
00:00:49,213 --> 00:00:51,913
Hey! Come over here,
I think I've found it!

3
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:00,540
<i>Come closer.</i>

4
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:03,509
<i>Do you know what you have found?</i>

5
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:06,133
<i>I'll tell you my story.</i>

6
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,730
<i>This skull was once my mother's.</i>

7
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:17,790
<i>These bones were once my family.</i>

8
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,240
<i>The blood our family spilled,
marked the beginning</i>

9
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,020
<i>of the most violent century
the world has ever known.</i>

10
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,920
<i>Mama,</i>

11
00:01:29,944 --> 00:01:32,744
<i>why did they hate us so much?</i>

12
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,390
<i>And why did they hate our friend,</i>

13
00:01:35,414 --> 00:01:37,914
<i>Father Grigori Rasputin?</i>

14
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,260
<i>He was my saviour,</i>

15
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,840
<i>my Merlin, my wizard.</i>

16
00:01:42,964 --> 00:01:45,964
<i>Father Grigori was magic.</i>

17
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,170
Grigori, what do you see?

18
00:01:56,194 --> 00:01:58,194
I see...

19
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:01,418
a flower.

20
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,400
Grigori,

21
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,500
what do you see?

22
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:14,546
Love?

23
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,980
What did he say?

24
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,680
It's my turn.

25
00:02:34,628 --> 00:02:36,628
Come closer.

26
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,450
--

27
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,990
He has no magic.

28
00:03:00,738 --> 00:03:02,238
Wait.

29
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,340
You stole Yegorov's horse.

30
00:03:08,964 --> 00:03:10,764
This boy is mad.

31
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,390
What are you raising,
a child or a devil?

32
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:19,314
Boy,

33
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,990
come here.

34
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,730
Apologise.

35
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:26,054
Why?

36
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:31,378
Forgive me.

37
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,930
But let him deny it, father.

38
00:03:34,054 --> 00:03:35,754
Let him deny it.

39
00:03:35,778 --> 00:03:36,978
Yes.

40
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,025
Let him deny it!

41
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:40,826
Let him deny it!

42
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,650
It's not true!

43
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:17,330
God is good

44
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,325
There he is.

45
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,660
They say you are a wizard.

46
00:04:47,884 --> 00:04:50,684
They say you're an imbecile.

47
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,480
Tell me, what do I have
behind my back?

48
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:02,404
A coin.

49
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:05,652
A book.

50
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:08,076
A leaf. A pipe. A rock.

51
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,700
The Archbishop's balls.

52
00:05:12,148 --> 00:05:14,648
I told you he's all dried up.

53
00:05:14,972 --> 00:05:16,172


54
00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:23,444
Plough this row to
that hill by nightfall

55
00:05:23,468 --> 00:05:25,568
or lose your pay.

56
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:31,864
-

57
00:05:46,632 --> 00:05:48,032
Enough!

58
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,750
<i>Father Grigori said</i>

59
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,040
<i>the holy mother
asked him to help me.</i>

60
00:06:54,264 --> 00:06:57,294
<i>No matter what people
said about him later,</i>

61
00:06:57,318 --> 00:06:59,118
<i>I know better,</i>

62
00:06:59,124 --> 00:07:01,744
<i>because he came to St. Petersburg</i>

63
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:04,168
<i>and he saved my life.</i>

64
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,910
She became the mother
of God himself.

65
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,060
She carried him in her arms.

66
00:07:23,084 --> 00:07:25,236
She nourished him with her milk.

67
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,220
Who can describe the greatness

68
00:07:28,244 --> 00:07:31,336
of the Virgin Mother of God.

69
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,560
I saw Her.

70
00:07:36,936 --> 00:07:38,836
I saw Her.

71
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,810
First the sky was empty,

72
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:44,534
then silver, then gold.

73
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,090
Her eyes were purple,

74
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,850
and Her skin was ivory,

75
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,780
and She reached out her hand
and blessed me.

76
00:07:54,904 --> 00:07:57,104
Who are you?

77
00:07:58,928 --> 00:08:02,328
Grigori Rasputin,
from Pokrovskoye.

78
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,724
Why are you here?

79
00:08:05,155 --> 00:08:08,355
The mother of God,
she told me to come.

80
00:08:09,493 --> 00:08:13,293
Many have come here claiming
to have seen the virgin.

81
00:08:14,617 --> 00:08:17,217
She touched me...

82
00:08:19,241 --> 00:08:20,841
here.

83
00:08:32,499 --> 00:08:35,529
<i>Some said the bishop was hypnotised.</i>

84
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,590
<i>Some said he had seen the truth.</i>

85
00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:44,580
<i>All of St. Petersburg
was talking about this day.</i>

86
00:08:46,728 --> 00:08:48,528
Bless me.

87
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,779
The Virgin has touched him.

88
00:09:24,876 --> 00:09:27,346
<i>There was little hope for me.</i>

89
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,246
<i>Me, Alexei.</i>

90
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,029
<i>Sovereign heir, Tsarevitch
to the Russian throne.</i>

91
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:35,653
God help me.

92
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:37,677
He will.

93
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:39,755
He will.

94
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:44,129
<i>How much mama prayed
that God would forgive her.</i>

95
00:09:44,153 --> 00:09:48,033
<i>For it was she who carried
my disease in her blood.</i>

96
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,270
Your majesty,

97
00:10:03,294 --> 00:10:06,694
I know of a holy man
who can heal.

98
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,650
What a wretch.

99
00:10:28,322 --> 00:10:29,922
Disgusting.

100
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:04,485
Alexi.

101
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,950
The man from Siberia is here.

102
00:11:10,574 --> 00:11:12,174
Mama.

103
00:11:17,115 --> 00:11:19,115
Don't be frightened.

104
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,289
Christ is with you,

105
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:24,096
don't weep anymore,
everything passes.

106
00:11:24,204 --> 00:11:26,055
Why is your heart so heavy?

107
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,579
Do you have faith?
There's no reason to suffer.

108
00:11:28,603 --> 00:11:31,083
The Lord bless his faithful servant

109
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,607
Alexandra Feodorovna.

110
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,190
This is Father Grigori,

111
00:11:40,214 --> 00:11:42,014
from Siberia.

112
00:11:45,364 --> 00:11:46,764
Papa.

113
00:11:48,289 --> 00:11:50,689
He's come to bless Alexei.

114
00:11:53,165 --> 00:11:55,565
The Tsarevitch is sleeping.

115
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,889
My blessings

116
00:11:58,813 --> 00:12:01,013
are powerful.

117
00:12:08,008 --> 00:12:09,608
Just a moment.

118
00:12:09,632 --> 00:12:11,632
He's sleeping, Father.

119
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,730
Grandpa?

120
00:12:27,754 --> 00:12:29,356
Alexei,

121
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,200
this is Father Grigori,

122
00:12:32,224 --> 00:12:34,924
he has come to bless you.

123
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,200
Father, quickly.

124
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,020
How is your leg?

125
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,144
Did you tell him?

126
00:12:43,968 --> 00:12:45,620
It hurts.

127
00:12:45,744 --> 00:12:47,944
Oh now, that's enough.

128
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,968
Derevenko, lead him out.

129
00:12:49,992 --> 00:12:52,336
No more opiates for this boy.

130
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,920
- Take him!
- No, wait.

131
00:12:55,386 --> 00:12:57,386
Do you like to sail?

132
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,572
Yes.

133
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,960
The sea brings comfort.

134
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:04,784
And the waves...

135
00:13:04,808 --> 00:13:06,908
they talk.

136
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,370
The sun shines on the water
as it gently rises.

137
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,470
You can see the face of God.

138
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,410
You look at the sun...

139
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:25,134
your soul

140
00:13:25,158 --> 00:13:27,572
forgets everything

141
00:13:27,596 --> 00:13:31,986
as you wake from the dream
of life's worries.

142
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:36,560
for the joy lights your heart

143
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:40,864
and your soul sees the wisdom of life

144
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,820
and beauty

145
00:13:42,844 --> 00:13:45,244
indescribable.

146
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,910
Is the pain gone?

147
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:52,534
Yes.

148
00:13:53,058 --> 00:13:54,858
There now.

149
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,330
Go to sleep.

150
00:13:59,778 --> 00:14:01,178
Sleep.

151
00:14:01,802 --> 00:14:03,602
I'm telling you.

152
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,250
Something to drink?

153
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,830
Madeira, if you have it.

154
00:14:52,902 --> 00:14:54,926
Who told you...

155
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,730
about Tsarevich's leg?

156
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,340
The mother of God.

157
00:15:02,464 --> 00:15:05,864
Her voice blooms like a kiss in my ears,

158
00:15:05,888 --> 00:15:08,398
and then grows till it hurts my body,

159
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,680
and tears at my ears until
I want to cry: enough!

160
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,110
She told me how your boy suffered.

161
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,810
I know his blood is diseased.

162
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,890
I don't know why I was chosen.
I'm just a poor, stupid man.

163
00:15:24,814 --> 00:15:27,814
Pray to her, mama, papa.

164
00:15:29,438 --> 00:15:31,438
God is good.

165
00:15:37,134 --> 00:15:39,134
The Prime Minister.

166
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:41,158
The French ambassador is here.

167
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,257
Peter.

168
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:44,682
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know.

169
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,086
This is Father Grigori.

170
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,590
Prime Minister Stolypin.

171
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,980
And, thank you so much
for coming, Father.

172
00:15:58,228 --> 00:16:00,228
Downstairs.

173
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,480
The man's drunk as a boiled owl.

174
00:16:16,352 --> 00:16:18,352
Thank you, Father.

175
00:16:28,596 --> 00:16:31,096
I'll call for a motor.

176
00:16:37,516 --> 00:16:40,516
Does a wretch drink wine
with the Empress?

177
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,640
Does a wretch rest his face
in her lap?

178
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,330
How else would he have known
about Alexei's leg?

179
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,030
Gossip.

180
00:17:00,054 --> 00:17:01,454
Hearsay.

181
00:17:01,878 --> 00:17:04,378
You saw him limp from the bed.

182
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:07,010
He took his pain.

183
00:17:12,455 --> 00:17:14,255
What is it, Nicky?

184
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,339
There has been another bombing.

185
00:17:19,055 --> 00:17:21,926
Stolypin thinks it's the
electrical workers and...

186
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,200
and the way they
want another meeting.

187
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,280
It's a plot to undermine you,

188
00:17:26,304 --> 00:17:29,104
to make you look weak
and start more trouble.

189
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,260
Smile.

190
00:17:46,684 --> 00:17:49,284
I never see you smile.

191
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,360
Do you remember the
little cottage we stayed in

192
00:17:57,384 --> 00:17:59,884
when we visited
your family in Germany?

193
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,270
And the picnics we used to have,

194
00:18:02,294 --> 00:18:04,944
and the songs we sang
under the chestnut tree?

195
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,430
What in the world
made you think of that?

196
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,960
And how those fishermen

197
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,660
splashed us with their oars,
and didn't know who we were.

198
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:14,808
--

199
00:18:15,832 --> 00:18:19,232
And how we never ever
wanted to leave.

200
00:18:22,904 --> 00:18:24,904
#

201
00:18:27,052 --> 00:18:29,052
#

202
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,700
#  #

203
00:18:48,816 --> 00:18:50,616
God

204
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,440
blast

205
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,764
the Tsar!

206
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,509
Do you know the saying
from my youth?

207
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:16,220
"After the last of my flesh
has tormented me

208
00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:19,620
"Lord Jesus Christ do not condemn me,

209
00:19:19,644 --> 00:19:21,444
"therefore."

210
00:19:23,068 --> 00:19:25,168
Do you know it?

211
00:20:07,615 --> 00:20:09,115
Alexei.

212
00:20:11,765 --> 00:20:13,265
Look.

213
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,440
It's a miracle.

214
00:20:28,565 --> 00:20:29,965
Oh.

215
00:20:32,415 --> 00:20:33,815
Papa!

216
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:35,839
Alexei?

217
00:20:35,863 --> 00:20:38,063
How did this happen?

218
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:40,287
The Holy Man did it.

219
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,559
I want to show the girls.

220
00:20:47,883 --> 00:20:49,083
Alexei.

221
00:20:49,107 --> 00:20:50,807
Morning, Dr Botkin.

222
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:55,231
Look! The Holy Man cured me!

223
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,079
It’s all gone. He took it all with him.

224
00:20:58,103 --> 00:21:00,103
- How?
- With magic!

225
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:01,649
Like Baba Yaga?

226
00:21:01,673 --> 00:21:04,473
Like a good wizard.
Like Jesus Christ.

227
00:21:04,874 --> 00:21:06,374
Meprobamate.

228
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:08,999
It’s known to slow the flow of blood
in some haemophiliacs.

229
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,190
I started using it last week.

230
00:21:11,214 --> 00:21:14,414
But Alexei was cured last night,
doctor, not last week.

231
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,150
These things often take times.

232
00:21:18,574 --> 00:21:20,974
--I can walk!

233
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,589
Who are you really?

234
00:21:30,213 --> 00:21:32,413
The infinite.

235
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:37,216
-

236
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,739
Next time your excellency
goes to the palace,

237
00:21:41,389 --> 00:21:45,189
Ask the Tsarina if I might
borrow her crown.

238
00:21:48,637 --> 00:21:51,037
I will see her today.

239
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:57,009
<i>Grigori Rasputin.</i>

240
00:21:57,639 --> 00:21:59,909
Her Imperial Majesty

241
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:04,333
The Empress Alexandra Feodorovna
now wishes to see me.

242
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:05,733
Yes.

243
00:22:08,981 --> 00:22:11,481
Now, call me a liar.

244
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,460
Ah.

245
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:41,070
I spend days on my knees

246
00:22:41,094 --> 00:22:43,653
to heal my son in minutes.

247
00:22:45,377 --> 00:22:47,877
Do you have faith, mama?

248
00:22:48,404 --> 00:22:50,195
I pray, I...

249
00:22:50,219 --> 00:22:52,719
In your heart, do you have it?

250
00:22:52,743 --> 00:22:55,343
- I try.
- Answer the question.

251
00:23:00,615 --> 00:23:02,216
I don't know.

252
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,730
Then get on your knees and beg. Beg like
a peasant with your knees in the dirt.

253
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:07,606
- How dare you!
- Like a beggar

254
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,640
or a sneak or a thief.

255
00:23:09,664 --> 00:23:12,064
You are the reason
the little one suffers.

256
00:23:12,088 --> 00:23:15,535
You doubt the divinity of God.
Your prayers mock his name.

257
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:19,159
Every time the boy screams,
it is your knife in his body.

258
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:21,739
Mama, God cursed your son.

259
00:23:21,763 --> 00:23:23,735
Only He can cure him.

260
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,010
Do doctors listen to God?
Answer.

261
00:23:27,525 --> 00:23:30,686
- No.
- No, the disease will leave him.

262
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,980
The holy mother promised
but only if you believe in her mercy.

263
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,580
Cherish and then, don't you see

264
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,209
God has sent me.

265
00:23:41,257 --> 00:23:43,057
I'm afraid.

266
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:45,181
The child isn't helpless

267
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,820
but he can do nothing
in his weakness.

268
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,590
He doesn't need medicine,
he needs a pony, a sled.

269
00:23:51,614 --> 00:23:53,714
We may pray to God
on our knees

270
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,199
but we also pray in joy,
in laughter and in love.

271
00:23:57,723 --> 00:23:59,223
Father...

272
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,290
I have premonitions.

273
00:24:04,414 --> 00:24:06,214
Of what?

274
00:24:08,262 --> 00:24:10,262
Terrible things.

275
00:24:12,386 --> 00:24:13,986
Tell me.

276
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,440
My husband

277
00:24:20,464 --> 00:24:23,164
does not want to rule.

278
00:24:27,236 --> 00:24:28,636
Wait.

279
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,260
Watch.

280
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:36,360
A miracle is yet to come.

281
00:24:41,832 --> 00:24:43,232
Alexei!

282
00:24:44,156 --> 00:24:45,556
Alexei!

283
00:24:48,628 --> 00:24:51,228
Let him be.

284
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,790
Go.

285
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,510
<i>Father Grigori set me free
with his magic.</i>

286
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:23,926
<i>I could play with my sisters
and teacher-- in the park again.</i>

287
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:28,730
<i>For the first time Mama could believe
in me as the next Tsar of Russia.</i>

288
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,250
<i>I had all that I wanted.</i>

289
00:25:31,374 --> 00:25:33,250
<i>What did others have?</i>

290
00:25:33,274 --> 00:25:35,374
<i>No food, no coal.</i>

291
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:39,180
<i>Some wrap papers on their feet
instead of shoes.</i>

292
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:42,840
<i>Papa said this is how God
has willed it.</i>

293
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,760
<i>I know that some call Papa,
Nicholas the Bloody</i>

294
00:25:46,784 --> 00:25:49,784
<i>but those were his enemies.</i>

295
00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:51,329
Boo!

296
00:25:52,554 --> 00:25:54,154
Who is that?

297
00:25:56,002 --> 00:25:58,202
I wanted to say goodnight.

298
00:25:58,226 --> 00:25:59,426
Come in.

299
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,450
-

300
00:26:02,398 --> 00:26:03,998
So, how are we?

301
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:05,022
Good.

302
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,546
Are you going to be
working all night again?

303
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,736
Probably.

304
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,460
Why do you work so hard?

305
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,800
Because I love Russia
and I love her people.

306
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,330
But they don't love
the revolutionaries.

307
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,790
Olga said so.

308
00:26:19,814 --> 00:26:21,314
No.

309
00:26:21,338 --> 00:26:24,406
They killed granddad, Alexei.

310
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,880
And Uncle Serge.

311
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,290
Why don't you give them
what they want?

312
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,430
Because they want the throne...

313
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:37,420
and God gave that to me and
only God can take it away.

314
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,210
Father Grigori could protect it for us.

315
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,900
Oh, I'll protect it for you, Alexei.

316
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,470
As my father protected it for me.

317
00:26:47,794 --> 00:26:49,794
I promise you.

318
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:09,419
<i>Mama and Papa were so happy on the day
when they could show me to everyone.</i>

319
00:27:09,709 --> 00:27:13,600
<i>We didn't tell them who
we had to thank for this miracle.</i>

320
00:28:16,969 --> 00:28:18,969
For me?

321
00:28:22,241 --> 00:28:24,841
And what do you know about love?

322
00:28:24,865 --> 00:28:26,765
- Olga's in love.
- I'm not!

323
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:28,989
- I saw you flirting.
- So do you.

324
00:28:29,113 --> 00:28:30,513
Who is he?

325
00:28:30,537 --> 00:28:32,937
You can tell me.
I'm an avant-garde.

326
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,750
Well, he's a marine guard
on the Standard.

327
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,710
What do we know about this Rasputin?

328
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,700
He has a fondness for
strong Madeira, cheese cake

329
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:49,224
and gypsy prostitutes.

330
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,720
We don't know if he talks
to God or to the devil.

331
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:03,479
After 12 years of torture

332
00:29:03,503 --> 00:29:05,903
I have peace.

333
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,779
And what if he were to talk to the press
about Alexei's condition.

334
00:29:09,803 --> 00:29:14,263
That the next Tsar to Russia could bleed to
death by pricking his finger on a rosebush.

335
00:29:14,739 --> 00:29:17,590
Handing the revolutionaries
more ammunition.

336
00:29:21,129 --> 00:29:23,629
Nicky, help me.

337
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,080
I love you.

338
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,550
Father Grigori.

339
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,680
A morsel of bread is
more precious to men

340
00:29:45,704 --> 00:29:49,204
than a mountain of
diamonds and gold, amen.

341
00:29:49,728 --> 00:29:51,428
Amen.

342
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,610
Tatiana, pass the bread.

343
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,480
Perhaps our next tsar

344
00:31:19,504 --> 00:31:22,304
will be called Alexei the Terrible.

345
00:31:25,474 --> 00:31:27,274
You know children,

346
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,300
when Father Grigori made his
pilgrimage to St Petersburg,

347
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:33,440
he travelled 1,000 miles all over it.

348
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,409
And I walked and walked

349
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:37,733
and walked, all day.

350
00:31:37,757 --> 00:31:38,957
Sometimes...

351
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:41,381
3 days without food.

352
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,720
I worked with the labourers
and I prayed by the river,

353
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:47,079
and I never once

354
00:31:47,103 --> 00:31:49,503
touched my flesh.

355
00:31:51,351 --> 00:31:53,351
But I was young then,

356
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:55,175
and have since learned

357
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:57,899
that although the soul
may belong to God

358
00:31:57,923 --> 00:32:00,723
and the flesh belongs to us.

359
00:32:03,771 --> 00:32:06,371
Have you been to
Mount Athos in Greece?

360
00:32:06,395 --> 00:32:07,595
Yes.

361
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,800
It's a simple place,
no gold or silver but

362
00:32:10,824 --> 00:32:12,665
for taking on the life.

363
00:32:12,689 --> 00:32:15,576
When I arrived, I went
for a walk through the woods

364
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,840
and suddenly I heard breathing

365
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,646
through the bushes

366
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,540
I saw two monks,

367
00:32:23,564 --> 00:32:25,364
naked as nature,

368
00:32:25,388 --> 00:32:27,588
one behind the other...

369
00:32:28,712 --> 00:32:30,712
Come with me.

370
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,930
Father, the palace is our home,
I insist you treat it with respect.

371
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:56,860
When you spit in the country it lands in
the dirt, here it lands on somebody's head.

372
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:59,040
The Empress likes you

373
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:01,136
a great deal, in fact...

374
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,610
she has opened her heart.

375
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,289
It is a fragile heart,
it is easily broken.

376
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:10,190
Without me, the little one will die.

377
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,420
I see more blood.

378
00:33:12,544 --> 00:33:15,644
I have his pain,
you will need me.

379
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:18,200
I think that that is enough.

380
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,039
I didn't choose to be holy, Papa.

381
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,339
It frightens me through.

382
00:33:25,363 --> 00:33:28,763
You will wait here for an escort.

383
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,539
<i>They came to celebrate</i>

384
00:34:16,563 --> 00:34:19,063
<i>300 years of Romana --.</i>

385
00:34:19,129 --> 00:34:21,210
<i>Our great dynasty</i>

386
00:34:21,234 --> 00:34:23,315
<i>anointed by God.</i>

387
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:27,780
<i>One day I will be Emperor and
autocrat of all the Russians.</i>

388
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:29,770
<i>Tsar of Moscow,</i>

389
00:34:29,794 --> 00:34:33,333
<i>Kiev, Vladimir, Kazan, of Poland,</i>

390
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,850
<i>of Siberia, of Georgia.</i>

391
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:38,374
<i>Grand Duke of Lithuania.</i>

392
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:42,790
<i>But what I thought
was the beginning,</i>

393
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:45,739
<i>turned out to be the
beginning of the end.</i>

394
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,380


395
00:37:33,155 --> 00:37:35,155
Make it stop! Make it stop!

396
00:37:35,179 --> 00:37:36,456
It's useless.

397
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,040
Maria, try to find Father Grigori.

398
00:37:39,064 --> 00:37:40,664
Father Grigori!

399
00:37:40,688 --> 00:37:43,446
- Maria, hurry!
- And a real priest.

400
00:37:47,512 --> 00:37:49,512
Lord have mercy.

401
00:37:49,536 --> 00:37:51,536
Christ have mercy.

402
00:38:04,804 --> 00:38:06,404
Grigori?

403
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:09,928
Grigori Rasputin, wake up.

404
00:38:12,973 --> 00:38:14,673
Father Grigori!

405
00:38:18,148 --> 00:38:19,148
Mama.

406
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:21,372
Please, help him.

407
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:32,040
God hear me now,

408
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:36,210
for the peace and tranquillity
of holy Russia,

409
00:38:36,334 --> 00:38:39,604
for the good of its people,

410
00:38:40,328 --> 00:38:42,128
spare

411
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:45,352
the life of this child.

412
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,230
For the Greek ---

413
00:39:10,102 --> 00:39:12,902
And the sun shining on the water

414
00:39:13,126 --> 00:39:15,926
See the face of God
in the waves.

415
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,070
Remember the pain

416
00:39:21,294 --> 00:39:23,894
as it leaves your body.

417
00:39:25,742 --> 00:39:28,342
Remember the joy

418
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,966
as it leapt in your heart.

419
00:40:00,638 --> 00:40:02,038
Mama.

420
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,760
Alexei.

421
00:40:23,484 --> 00:40:25,684
Open your eyes.

422
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,710
Alexei.

423
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:40,510
Open your eyes.

424
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,790
Alexei.

425
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,630
Open your eyes.

426
00:41:47,802 --> 00:41:49,502
Oh...

427
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,840
Very impressive.

428
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,760
You'll always fail

429
00:42:14,784 --> 00:42:17,584
because your soul is dead.

430
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:21,820
I have performed many
autopsies in my time

431
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,730
but I've never located a soul.

432
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,630
How many memories

433
00:42:27,654 --> 00:42:30,654
or emotions have you found?

434
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:48,079
The future of Russia is in your hands.

435
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:54,580
The man is a first class hypnotist.

436
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:58,330
We were in the same room, doctor?
Did we see the same thing?

437
00:42:58,354 --> 00:43:01,354
By hypnotising the boy,
he lowers his blood pressure,

438
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:03,530
slowing the flow
of the blood itself.

439
00:43:03,554 --> 00:43:05,954
What I saw was a miracle!

440
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:09,740
The mind is capable
of fantastic things.

441
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:12,430
The man is soothing,
the boy likes him.

442
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,090
There's nothing more to it than that.

443
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,330
Sir, forgive me,

444
00:43:21,854 --> 00:43:26,654
I think it's about time the people
knew the truth about your son's health.

445
00:43:26,716 --> 00:43:28,596
People are talking.

446
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:31,250
The papers are making up
all kinds of stories

447
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,820
to explain this man's
presence in the palace.

448
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,910
I don't care, doctor,

449
00:43:35,934 --> 00:43:38,334
he saved my son.

450
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,920
This is his new address.

451
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,060
I want you to post around-the-clock
surveillance and record everything.

452
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:49,284
And begin immediately.

453
00:44:50,985 --> 00:44:52,785
"The story of my life."

454
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:55,300
"Although I am a poor man
with no learning.

455
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:58,360
"I have already performed
great services for the crown."

456
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,110
What services?

457
00:45:00,134 --> 00:45:04,336
The Empress has been under a
great deal of psychological pressure.

458
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,200
So what are you saying?

459
00:45:08,148 --> 00:45:10,148
She's very...

460
00:45:10,272 --> 00:45:12,072
vulnerable.

461
00:45:33,796 --> 00:45:35,596


462
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,250
Father Grigori?

463
00:45:54,998 --> 00:45:57,398
They say you are fool.

464
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:59,430
I'm a believer.

465
00:45:59,654 --> 00:46:02,054
Princess Marisa Ivanovna.

466
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,360
This is for you.

467
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,140
I forgive you.

468
00:46:27,688 --> 00:46:29,288
Sit.

469
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,380
Why are you here?

470
00:46:56,776 --> 00:46:59,276
- My husband...
- Shht!

471
00:47:02,879 --> 00:47:05,710
What's all this noise?

472
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:13,699
You think that you love him
and I see that you do

473
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:17,559
but when night comes and you
climb into bed, he leaves you alone.

474
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:18,849
Yes.

475
00:47:18,873 --> 00:47:20,873
Yet, someone else

476
00:47:20,959 --> 00:47:23,990
who puts her black hair
on his chest

477
00:47:24,014 --> 00:47:26,834
and listens to his heart

478
00:47:26,858 --> 00:47:29,458
beat in her ear.

479
00:47:29,693 --> 00:47:32,193
- How can you know this?
- And I see a tall man

480
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:34,700
with the face of an eagle and

481
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:39,030
a jacket that is covered
in ribbons and gold.

482
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,969
He wants <i>your</i> heart

483
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:49,130
but he has a wife of his own.
What a web we weave.

484
00:47:49,254 --> 00:47:51,554
What else do you know?

485
00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:57,180
The greatest gift in the world is love.

486
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:59,620
Only through love

487
00:47:59,644 --> 00:48:02,144
can we enter the gates of heaven.

488
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:05,290
You understand.
But pride is a sin

489
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,050
and you are so full of pride.

490
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:13,210
What is the greatest sin of pride?

491
00:48:15,558 --> 00:48:17,058
Chastity.

492
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:20,460
Repentance is very pleasing to God

493
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:22,950
but before we can repent

494
00:48:22,974 --> 00:48:25,774
we first have to sin.

495
00:48:26,998 --> 00:48:28,498
What?

496
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:32,380
God has the answers.
He has the key.

497
00:48:33,728 --> 00:48:34,928
No.

498
00:48:34,952 --> 00:48:38,052
A humble soul is a holy soul.
Humble yourself.

499
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:40,389
Kiss me.

500
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:47,290
--means more to me than this.

501
00:48:49,725 --> 00:48:51,325
--

502
00:48:53,573 --> 00:48:56,073
I would cut these wrists,

503
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,590
if it would give you a
single moment of happiness.

504
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,840
Think of God, my angel.

505
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:29,740
He gave us this pleasure.

506
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:33,509
I talk to God.

507
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,570
Kiss me

508
00:49:37,894 --> 00:49:40,294
and you kiss Him.

509
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:45,300
Lay with me and you will lay with Him.

510
00:49:46,948 --> 00:49:49,748
I know you're frightened,
I'm frightened too.

511
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:53,320
But when we kiss holy things

512
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:58,129
we should kiss with
the soul and the heart.

513
00:49:58,753 --> 00:50:01,353
As well as the mouth.

514
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,401
Let me kiss you.

515
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:45,459
God

516
00:50:45,983 --> 00:50:48,183
is love.

517
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:10,390
Father, bless me!

518
00:51:10,414 --> 00:51:12,514
Father, I'm sick. Make me well.

519
00:51:12,538 --> 00:51:14,641
Father, touch me!

520
00:51:14,665 --> 00:51:16,365
Oh, Father.

521
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,910
Certain ladies,
and I use the term loosely

522
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:22,190
have arranged a club whereby
they take turns in his bed.

523
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:24,900
He says it will put them
closer to God.

524
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,480
Princess Marisa Ivanovna,
your own cousin!

525
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:31,140
People say that Tsarina knows peace
only with her head on his shoulders.

526
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,200
This man is doing more
damage to the dynasty

527
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:35,680
than a hundred
revolutionaries ever could.

528
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,490
Why do you need him?

529
00:51:37,514 --> 00:51:38,890
If the Tsarevich—

530
00:51:38,914 --> 00:51:41,414
The Tsarevich has nothing
to do with it.

531
00:51:45,786 --> 00:51:48,186
It's all over the city.

532
00:51:58,585 --> 00:52:00,785
I love my country.

533
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,650
And I love of you.

534
00:52:04,974 --> 00:52:07,374
But this man must go.

535
00:52:08,522 --> 00:52:10,566
Enough is enough.

536
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:14,250
Nicky, don't you see? God is
testing us to see if we are worthy!

537
00:52:14,274 --> 00:52:17,374
Alex, this man is
a danger to Russia!

538
00:52:17,398 --> 00:52:18,498
Oh!

539
00:52:19,754 --> 00:52:21,754
Look... at this.

540
00:52:22,478 --> 00:52:23,926
I'm sorry, Alex.

541
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:26,780
He is a danger to me and to you
and to Alexei.

542
00:52:31,656 --> 00:52:33,056
Nicky,

543
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,340
you do this and you
are spitting at God.

544
00:52:36,364 --> 00:52:38,164
And God well forgive me.

545
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:40,088
But I never will!

546
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:06,460
-

547
00:53:08,908 --> 00:53:10,708
-

548
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,480
#

549
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,180
Hey.

550
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,700
#

551
00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:36,905
--

552
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:41,919
If you won't be decent,
then I have to ask you to leave.

553
00:54:42,643 --> 00:54:43,943
Me?

554
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,167
Yes.

555
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:50,010
The Empress kisses my hand!

556
00:54:51,034 --> 00:54:53,734
I am her saviour!

557
00:54:53,982 --> 00:54:56,436
And her angel!

558
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,960
I am the Empresses nephew!

559
00:55:17,059 --> 00:55:19,119
Very pretty

560
00:55:19,843 --> 00:55:22,043
but I prefer

561
00:55:22,167 --> 00:55:23,667
women.

562
00:55:25,509 --> 00:55:27,319
Are you saying

563
00:55:27,343 --> 00:55:29,843
you sleep with the Empress?

564
00:55:37,463 --> 00:55:39,663
I am

565
00:55:39,887 --> 00:55:42,487
a great man!

566
00:55:46,059 --> 00:55:47,859
A great.

567
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:49,483
Big.

568
00:55:49,507 --> 00:55:51,007
Man.

569
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:23,200
His Majesty will see you now.

570
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,269
I can't be hypnotised,

571
00:56:34,293 --> 00:56:36,293
so don't bother.

572
00:56:55,233 --> 00:56:59,233
Do you realise
what you have done to my family?

573
00:57:02,705 --> 00:57:05,505
All my life I've had nothing.

574
00:57:05,529 --> 00:57:07,405
Now I have too much.

575
00:57:07,429 --> 00:57:10,029
But I never hurt anyone, Papa.

576
00:57:10,053 --> 00:57:12,053
You have hurt me!

577
00:57:12,077 --> 00:57:15,477
Everything I do, I think of God.

578
00:57:15,501 --> 00:57:19,101
I dread to imagine
what He might think of you.

579
00:57:19,849 --> 00:57:23,549
You are ordered to leave
St. Petersburg in 24 hours.

580
00:57:26,397 --> 00:57:28,997
I want to stay here!

581
00:57:29,121 --> 00:57:31,721
There are thieves
all around you, Papa.

582
00:57:31,745 --> 00:57:34,545
They want to rob me of your love!

583
00:57:37,293 --> 00:57:40,493
Did -- come for our country, Papa?

584
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:45,641
We will all drown in blood.
Oceans of tears, oceans of blood.

585
00:57:45,689 --> 00:57:49,089
Millions will die here.
These are not my words.

586
00:57:49,113 --> 00:57:50,813
Leave, or you'll be arrested.

587
00:57:50,837 --> 00:57:54,337
Death is behind him.
There it is! You see it?

588
00:57:54,361 --> 00:57:56,761
It will have him within a month!

589
00:57:56,785 --> 00:57:58,085
This is enough!

590
00:57:58,109 --> 00:58:00,609
There is more than just God, Papa.

591
00:58:00,633 --> 00:58:03,233
I am nothing and everything
but I have seen the infinite!

592
00:58:03,257 --> 00:58:06,257
I walk with Pan, with Eros,
with Brahma,

593
00:58:06,281 --> 00:58:09,681
with Vishnu, with Isis,
with Ansher and Belial.

594
00:58:09,805 --> 00:58:12,805
Why was I chosen?
I don't know!

595
00:58:12,853 --> 00:58:15,253
But I am Russia!

596
00:58:17,701 --> 00:58:20,901
I have taken your pain!

597
00:58:22,949 --> 00:58:26,149
I have your pain!

598
00:58:56,569 --> 00:58:58,569


599
00:59:06,289 --> 00:59:08,289
--

600
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,520
Alex?

601
00:59:50,868 --> 00:59:53,168
You are not alone.

602
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:02,090
I love you.

603
01:00:19,539 --> 01:00:21,539
Where is he?

604
01:00:21,563 --> 01:00:23,065
Prime Minister.

605
01:00:23,289 --> 01:00:24,790
Serge.

606
01:00:25,014 --> 01:00:27,556
I apologise your Majesty

607
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:31,020
but the heir to the Austrian Empire
has been assassinated.

608
01:00:34,046 --> 01:00:35,496
Assassinated?

609
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,096
By a Serb.

610
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,009
In Sarajevo.

611
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,859
The Austrians will
probably invade Serbia.

612
01:00:49,709 --> 01:00:53,390
We cannot be indifferent to
the fate of our Serbian allies.

613
01:00:53,459 --> 01:00:55,600
Make that clear to the Austrians.

614
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:59,389
But if we threaten the Austrians they
will ask the German Kaiser to threaten us.

615
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,090
Does he really?

616
01:01:01,959 --> 01:01:05,250
He would never agree to go to war
against Russia. Against me.

617
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:07,350
I shall ask him to

618
01:01:07,374 --> 01:01:10,174
persuade the Austrians
to calm down.

619
01:01:11,004 --> 01:01:12,704
And if he refuses?

620
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:16,649
I think Your Majesty should put our
forces on the war footing immediately.

621
01:01:16,849 --> 01:01:19,890
I am not prepared to send
hundreds of thousands

622
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:22,370
of Russian soldiers to their deaths.

623
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:24,450
It may not come to that.

624
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:27,950
But your cousin has
long dreamt of war,

625
01:01:27,974 --> 01:01:30,174
now he has an excuse.

626
01:02:25,935 --> 01:02:27,435


627
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:38,770
<i>That was behind him</i>

628
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:41,599
<i>just as Father Grigori had said.</i>

629
01:02:46,389 --> 01:02:49,680
<i>What Papa feared the most, happened.</i>

630
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:54,050
<i>Germany, Mama's own country,
became our enemy.</i>

631
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,130
<i>"Oceans of tears,</i>

632
01:02:56,154 --> 01:02:59,454
<i>"oceans of blood"
Father Grigori said.</i>

633
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:01,830
<i>We would all drown.</i>

634
01:03:11,974 --> 01:03:16,774
110,000 people killed in
the battle of Tannenberg.

635
01:03:18,325 --> 01:03:22,725
110,000 people killed in
the battle of Tannenberg.

636
01:03:23,149 --> 01:03:27,549
110,000 people killed in
the battle of Tannenberg...

637
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:32,130
Your Majesty, how can you
take control of the army?

638
01:03:32,146 --> 01:03:34,906
Your only training
is as a cavalry officer.

639
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:38,340
How can you run both the
army and the government?

640
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:41,740
All military and political blame
will be aimed directly at you.

641
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:44,500
Your Majesty,
the unrest in our streets

642
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:47,540
is as alarming and as dangerous now,

643
01:03:47,564 --> 01:03:49,976
as the problems at the front.

644
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,270
Your Majesty, you must
stay in St Petersburg.

645
01:04:04,384 --> 01:04:06,425
<i>Dear Holy Mother,</i>

646
01:04:06,449 --> 01:04:08,290
<i>I'm so afraid,</i>

647
01:04:08,414 --> 01:04:11,436
<i>please send us Father Grigori.</i>

648
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:13,890
<i>Papa needs him</i>

649
01:04:14,314 --> 01:04:16,866
<i>and I need him, too.</i>

650
01:04:30,595 --> 01:04:32,595
Father Grigori!

651
01:04:33,319 --> 01:04:35,519
Father Grigori!

652
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,520
Father Grigori!

653
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,344
Ohh!

654
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:49,416
--

655
01:04:50,664 --> 01:04:52,664
-

656
01:04:53,888 --> 01:04:56,888
<i>...hear every word.</i>

657
01:04:58,536 --> 01:05:01,036
<i>If you do not,</i>

658
01:05:02,384 --> 01:05:04,584
<i>have no fear.</i>

659
01:05:05,808 --> 01:05:09,308
<i>God has seen your tears</i>

660
01:05:09,332 --> 01:05:12,332
<i>and heard your prayers.</i>

661
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,080
<i>It doesn't hurt</i>

662
01:05:15,104 --> 01:05:16,604
<i>anymore,</i>

663
01:05:16,628 --> 01:05:18,406
<i>does it?</i>

664
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:20,890
<i>Watch the pain</i>

665
01:05:20,914 --> 01:05:22,714
<i>go away</i>

666
01:05:22,738 --> 01:05:25,538
<i>like a white turtledove.</i>

667
01:05:25,862 --> 01:05:29,262
<i>There. See it fly out the window?</i>

668
01:05:29,286 --> 01:05:31,286
<i>It's all gone.</i>

669
01:05:31,310 --> 01:05:33,710
<i>Now go to sleep.</i>

670
01:05:34,758 --> 01:05:36,558
<i>My boy,</i>

671
01:05:36,782 --> 01:05:38,382
<i>sleep.</i>

672
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:42,530
<i>Sleep.</i>

673
01:05:43,454 --> 01:05:44,954
<i>Sleep.</i>

674
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:11,910
How is he?

675
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:15,470
Father Grigori has healed him.

676
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:18,690
- But I thought he was in Siberia.
- Yes.

677
01:06:20,938 --> 01:06:23,538
I spat at God once.

678
01:06:23,862 --> 01:06:25,862
Never again.

679
01:07:12,975 --> 01:07:16,415
I know that all have
desired more of you.

680
01:07:16,439 --> 01:07:18,639
Even the most faithful.

681
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:21,736
You are the Tsar,

682
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,436
the father of the people.

683
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:27,299
Do not let the fools triumph.

684
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,640
Do not let them throw
themselves and us

685
01:07:30,664 --> 01:07:32,664
into the abyss.

686
01:08:06,179 --> 01:08:08,669
<i>My precious darling,</i>

687
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:11,799
<i>I arrived at headquarters
on Tuesday morning.</i>

688
01:08:11,969 --> 01:08:14,950
<i>The situation is worse
than imaginable.</i>

689
01:08:14,999 --> 01:08:17,449
<i>Our men are facing
German machine guns</i>

690
01:08:17,473 --> 01:08:19,426
<i>with sticks in their hands.</i>

691
01:08:19,450 --> 01:08:22,069
<i>They wait for their
fellow soldiers to die</i>

692
01:08:22,093 --> 01:08:24,393
<i>so that they can have a gun.</i>

693
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:29,310
<i>As to the revolutionaries at home,</i>

694
01:08:29,334 --> 01:08:31,534
<i>I say drown them all.</i>

695
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:34,630
<i>How I wish Stolypin was still with us.</i>

696
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:37,540
<i>The Germans have
already struck at Riga,</i>

697
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:40,370
<i>while others marched
towards Galicia.</i>

698
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:43,050
<i>My generals and I cannot agree,</i>

699
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:45,789
<i>unfair to commit our forces.</i>

700
01:08:46,213 --> 01:08:49,026
We could go north, towards Riga,

701
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:50,989
but it's already winter

702
01:08:50,989 --> 01:08:54,250
and that alone should prevent
the Germans from settling in.

703
01:08:54,289 --> 01:08:56,250
South is vulnerable,

704
01:08:56,274 --> 01:08:57,974
especially Galicia.

705
01:08:58,198 --> 01:08:59,198


706
01:09:00,646 --> 01:09:03,246
Should we move north or south?

707
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:07,030
Father?

708
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,420
North.

709
01:09:12,644 --> 01:09:14,844
"Father Grigori

710
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:17,680
"begs you

"towards Riga."

713
01:09:26,109 --> 01:09:28,540
It was seen in the night.

With the help of this Siberian madman!

The Tsarina runs our children into ruin!

722
01:09:58,704 --> 01:10:01,504
How much longer

723
01:10:01,528 --> 01:10:04,928
do we allow these bloodthirsty...

724
01:10:05,552 --> 01:10:08,552
to spit in our faces.

725
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:11,690
Have I done the right thing?

726
01:10:11,914 --> 01:10:14,414
Send me a sign...

727
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:22,010
please.

728
01:10:32,765 --> 01:10:34,165
Mama!

729
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:39,050
The Holy Mother won't answer my prayers.
She’s turned Her back on me. Help me!

730
01:10:40,498 --> 01:10:42,498
I'm so scared.

731
01:10:42,522 --> 01:10:44,722
When did you last see Her?

732
01:10:45,246 --> 01:10:46,846
Weeks.

733
01:10:54,042 --> 01:10:56,042
Here's to traitors!

734
01:10:58,089 --> 01:11:01,189
Down with bloody Nicholas!

735
01:11:02,138 --> 01:11:04,538
And the German bitch!

Do we not as Russians have a duty to...

739
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:22,430
to shut off our monastery

741
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:27,715
and all of Russia!

742
01:11:27,739 --> 01:11:30,399
We can no longer stand by

743
01:11:30,423 --> 01:11:33,913
as this man of God
defiles our nation!

744
01:11:33,923 --> 01:11:37,223
If the name of the Tsar
means anything to you!

745
01:11:37,247 --> 01:11:39,547
If you hope to save Russia

746
01:11:39,571 --> 01:11:42,271
from the revolutionaries
who threaten her,

747
01:11:42,271 --> 01:11:44,671
then Grigori Rasputin

748
01:11:44,695 --> 01:11:46,895
must be stopped!

749
01:11:46,919 --> 01:11:48,519
Hear, hear!

750
01:11:55,015 --> 01:11:57,015


751
01:11:59,063 --> 01:12:01,063
--

752
01:12:08,425 --> 01:12:11,225
I'll do anything to stop him.

753
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:13,390
For my country.

754
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:32,570
Did you see the vision?

755
01:12:33,194 --> 01:12:35,194
Don't lie.

756
01:12:40,995 --> 01:12:42,895
I saw Her.

757
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:45,410
She gave me my power.

758
01:12:45,934 --> 01:12:49,334
How else could I have
known about the boy?

759
01:12:50,226 --> 01:12:52,686
Did you see the vision?

760
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:56,650
I swear!

761
01:12:57,274 --> 01:13:00,274
In your mind or before your eyes?

762
01:13:02,890 --> 01:13:05,900
In your mind or before your eyes?

763
01:13:05,924 --> 01:13:08,986
- It's the same.
- Don't you know the difference?

764
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
I saw her, that's all that counts!

765
01:13:12,050 --> 01:13:14,500
Say where you saw her?

766
01:13:15,624 --> 01:13:17,224
Say it!

767
01:13:19,296 --> 01:13:21,896
I'm not mad!

768
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,820
Where did you see her?

769
01:13:23,844 --> 01:13:25,520
It's the same!

770
01:13:25,544 --> 01:13:27,044
Answer!

771
01:13:37,388 --> 01:13:38,988
Here.

772
01:13:42,136 --> 01:13:44,536
But look what I've done for you!

773
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,360
Oh, look indeed.

774
01:13:46,384 --> 01:13:48,384
I saw Her!

775
01:13:48,708 --> 01:13:51,108
She came to me!

776
01:13:51,432 --> 01:13:53,632
I have magic!

777
01:13:53,656 --> 01:13:55,956
From the devil!

778
01:14:00,028 --> 01:14:01,828
Mama,

779
01:14:02,752 --> 01:14:05,352
look at me, please!

780
01:14:21,696 --> 01:14:23,396
Mama!

781
01:14:29,867 --> 01:14:31,367
Mama!

782
01:14:32,515 --> 01:14:34,015
Mama!

783
01:14:35,842 --> 01:14:37,442


784
01:14:52,179 --> 01:14:53,779
I...

785
01:14:53,803 --> 01:14:55,403
leave

786
01:14:55,427 --> 01:14:57,027
this

787
01:14:59,179 --> 01:15:00,849
behind

788
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:09,850
What?

789
01:15:09,874 --> 01:15:13,506
I'm sorry to bother you at this hour,
this is Prince Felix Yusupov.

790
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:17,160
My wife Irina is very ill and she
asks if you'll come and see her.

791
01:15:17,964 --> 01:15:19,064
No.

792
01:15:19,088 --> 01:15:21,788
Please, Father, I beg you.

793
01:15:23,464 --> 01:15:25,064
<i>I can't.</i>

794
01:15:25,288 --> 01:15:28,088
You won't say no
to the niece of the Tsar?

795
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,220
I will come in 3 days.

796
01:15:34,244 --> 01:15:36,864
But she leaves for Crimea
in the morning.

797
01:15:36,888 --> 01:15:38,788
I'll send a motor.

798
01:15:42,536 --> 01:15:44,036
Father?

799
01:15:45,584 --> 01:15:47,584
Then do it.

800
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:29,159
How many does he have to eat?

801
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:32,779
One of these cakes
will kill him instantly.

802
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,170
I'm so glad you could come.

803
01:16:40,879 --> 01:16:44,929
This is my parents domain,
my rooms are in the basement.

804
01:16:45,153 --> 01:16:48,574
Irina is entertaining some friends,
they will --

805
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:52,649
- I thought she was dying.
- She is, from a headache.

806
01:17:10,699 --> 01:17:12,729
What do you drink?

807
01:17:12,953 --> 01:17:14,753
- Madeira.
- Ah.

808
01:17:14,969 --> 01:17:17,729
We have some from
our very own vineyard.

809
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,130
To Russia.

810
01:17:39,419 --> 01:17:41,200
To Russia.

811
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:13,999
No.

812
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:15,723
More wine.

813
01:19:11,050 --> 01:19:13,470
What are you gaping at?

814
01:19:23,010 --> 01:19:25,260
So, where is she?

815
01:19:28,884 --> 01:19:30,884
I'll be right back.

816
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:45,600
Is he dead?

817
01:19:45,624 --> 01:19:47,224
I can't understand it.

818
01:19:47,248 --> 01:19:49,848
- Did he eat one?
- He ate three!

819
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,229
Pure cyanide.

820
01:19:56,253 --> 01:19:58,053
I swear.

821
01:20:04,225 --> 01:20:06,325
In his wine.

822
01:20:07,773 --> 01:20:09,273
All of it?

823
01:20:09,297 --> 01:20:10,697
Go.

824
01:20:17,293 --> 01:20:19,693
#

825
01:20:29,237 --> 01:20:30,737
Bravo.

826
01:20:30,961 --> 01:20:34,961
I know a brothel that has
only gypsies. We'll go there.

827
01:20:35,209 --> 01:20:39,209
With God in mind
and mankind in the flesh.

828
01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:47,300
I can taste the barrel.

829
01:20:47,324 --> 01:20:48,924
I'm going.

830
01:20:48,948 --> 01:20:50,548
But... Irina is coming.

831
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:53,500
She's coming, she's coming.
Maybe she flew by and I missed her.

832
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:56,320
She leaves in the morning,
she'll be gone for 6 months.

833
01:20:57,744 --> 01:21:00,544
Then get me some more Madeira.

834
01:21:02,616 --> 01:21:04,216
It's upstairs.

835
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:07,540
# Die, die, we're all going to die #

836
01:21:13,765 --> 01:21:16,565
Maybe... he is holy!

837
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:22,820
It's impossible.

838
01:21:22,844 --> 01:21:24,644
He drank it all?

839
01:21:24,868 --> 01:21:26,668
He's dancing.

840
01:21:33,459 --> 01:21:35,390
Let him go then.

841
01:21:35,414 --> 01:21:37,714
He can't leave this house alive!

842
01:21:56,079 --> 01:21:59,079
#

843
01:22:08,229 --> 01:22:10,999
This cabinet is beautiful.

844
01:22:11,023 --> 01:22:13,023
Can I take it?

845
01:22:15,471 --> 01:22:16,971


846
01:22:20,643 --> 01:22:22,143


847
01:22:22,267 --> 01:22:23,767


848
01:23:06,475 --> 01:23:08,275
He's dead.

849
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,830
Get the bag.

850
01:23:25,954 --> 01:23:27,554
Are you crazy!

851
01:23:27,578 --> 01:23:29,378
Get some air!

852
01:24:20,926 --> 01:24:22,926
--

853
01:24:27,198 --> 01:24:28,998
Shoot him!

854
01:24:33,594 --> 01:24:35,394
Kill him!

855
01:25:22,555 --> 01:25:24,255
The pain.

856
01:25:28,530 --> 01:25:30,360
The pain.

857
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:39,933
It's over.

858
01:26:05,110 --> 01:26:07,410
<i>I leave this behind</i>

859
01:26:07,434 --> 01:26:09,934
<i>because I will soon die.</i>

860
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:13,310
<i>Know that if I am killed
by my brother peasants</i>

861
01:26:13,409 --> 01:26:15,860
<i>then you have nothing to fear.</i>

862
01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:19,240
<i>But if I am murdered by nobles</i>

863
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:23,360
<i>if your relatives cause my death,
then no one</i>

864
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:26,700
<i>not you or your children
will remain alive</i>

865
01:26:26,860 --> 01:26:29,889
<i>for more than 2 years.</i>

866
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:34,279
<i>You will all be killed
by the Russian people.</i>

867
01:26:35,003 --> 01:26:36,903
<i>Your friend,</i>

868
01:26:36,927 --> 01:26:38,727
<i>Grigori.</i>

869
01:26:44,249 --> 01:26:45,789
Yes?

870
01:26:51,413 --> 01:26:53,913
Excuse me, your Majesty,

871
01:26:54,429 --> 01:26:57,289
but they just found the body.

872
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:01,200
Who did it?

873
01:27:01,224 --> 01:27:03,724
We're holding Vladimir Purishkevich,

874
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:06,800
vice-president of the Duma.

875
01:27:09,210 --> 01:27:12,930
As well as Prince Felix Yussoupov.

876
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,419
I'm so sorry.

877
01:27:17,543 --> 01:27:19,843
Your own family.

878
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:36,030
<i>From that day on,
Mama never smiled again.</i>

879
01:27:43,290 --> 01:27:45,390
<i>We buried Father Grigori</i>

880
01:27:45,414 --> 01:27:48,114
<i>in a secret place near the palace.</i>

881
01:27:48,790 --> 01:27:51,430
<i>His murderers were exiled.</i>

882
01:27:51,554 --> 01:27:54,356
<i>Mama said they were
not punished hard enough</i>

883
01:27:54,426 --> 01:27:56,906
<i>for what they had done to us.</i>

884
01:27:57,030 --> 01:28:00,670
<i>They took away
the only friend we had.</i>

885
01:28:00,694 --> 01:28:02,694


886
01:28:18,042 --> 01:28:20,042
-

887
01:28:24,114 --> 01:28:25,914
Please, don't.

888
01:28:26,138 --> 01:28:28,138
-

889
01:28:34,834 --> 01:28:36,834
-

890
01:28:39,382 --> 01:28:41,382
-

891
01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:46,630
-

892
01:28:51,402 --> 01:28:53,002
-

893
01:28:57,074 --> 01:28:59,074
-

894
01:29:31,660 --> 01:29:34,180
<i>Papa said what is given by God</i>

895
01:29:34,204 --> 01:29:36,804
<i>cannot be taken away by man.</i>

896
01:29:37,236 --> 01:29:39,456
<i>Why was God looking away</i>

897
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:42,280
<i>when Papa had to give up the throne?</i>

898
01:29:48,376 --> 01:29:50,376
-

899
01:30:38,505 --> 01:30:40,505
Go with me.

900
01:30:42,553 --> 01:30:44,553
This way.

901
01:31:00,255 --> 01:31:02,255
-

902
01:31:17,579 --> 01:31:19,579
Pick them up.

903
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:00,100
-

904
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:30,360
We're all going to die.

905
01:33:34,665 --> 01:33:36,865
<i>They killed Aunt Ella,</i>

906
01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:39,500
<i>Uncle Serge, Igor,</i>

907
01:33:39,524 --> 01:33:42,124
<i>Constantine, Oleg.</i>

908
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:45,560
<i>All our relatives
who could not escape.</i>

909
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:14,570
<i>The new rulers made us prisoners
in a house in Siberia.</i>

910
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:19,390
{\an8}<i>Today it is 18 months
since Father Grigori died.</i>

911
01:34:32,939 --> 01:34:34,439
Mama.

912
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:42,740
Don't be scared.

913
01:34:44,170 --> 01:34:46,639
I'm not scared, Mama.

914
01:34:47,163 --> 01:34:49,463
Then I won't be.

915
01:34:51,111 --> 01:34:53,211
Trust in God.

916
01:34:54,035 --> 01:34:56,035
I trust you.

917
01:35:17,490 --> 01:35:19,890
I made so many mistakes.

918
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:23,190
I'm so sorry.

919
01:35:25,314 --> 01:35:28,514
You always love me
more than anyone.

920
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:32,080
I'll always love you
more than anyone.

921
01:35:38,499 --> 01:35:40,049
Sometimes,

922
01:35:40,199 --> 01:35:43,230
you don't know where
to look for answers.

923
01:35:43,854 --> 01:35:45,254
Sometimes,

924
01:35:45,278 --> 01:35:48,078
you don't know what to believe.

925
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:22,239
Do you remember the chestnut tree?

926
01:36:23,063 --> 01:36:25,163
The fishermen?

927
01:36:26,539 --> 01:36:28,370
With their oars.

928
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:33,109
And how I never, ever wanted to leave.

929
01:36:36,055 --> 01:36:38,055


930
01:36:41,529 --> 01:36:43,229
Get ready!

931
01:37:24,685 --> 01:37:26,485
In here.

932
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:41,610
We're going to take your picture.

933
01:37:42,034 --> 01:37:43,434
Why?

934
01:37:43,489 --> 01:37:45,680
There are rumours in Moscow

935
01:37:45,704 --> 01:37:48,586
which say that you are all dead.

936
01:37:48,610 --> 01:37:50,180
All there.

937
01:37:54,890 --> 01:37:57,590
Can we at least have some chairs?

938
01:37:57,729 --> 01:37:59,290
Chairs.

939
01:38:59,669 --> 01:39:01,979
For crimes against Russia,

940
01:39:02,003 --> 01:39:05,553
the Ural Soviet has hereby
sentenced you to death.

941
01:39:09,129 --> 01:39:11,210
Your life is finished.

942
01:39:11,234 --> 01:39:12,434
What?

943
01:39:55,910 --> 01:39:59,360
<i>Sometimes we have to
believe in something.</i>

944
01:40:05,260 --> 01:40:08,460
<i>Sometimes we have to
believe in magic.</i>

945
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:13,360
<i>Is the pain gone?</i>

946
01:40:14,708 --> 01:40:16,108
<i>Yes.</i>
