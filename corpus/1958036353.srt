1
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,667
[barking]
Whoa!

2
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,133
Jake, where are you going?

3
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:37,833
[barking]
Oh, well. Hello.

4
00:01:37,867 --> 00:01:39,600
How are you?
Oh, hi.

5
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:41,267
Hi!

6
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,367
I see you've met Jake.

7
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,933
Yeah. Not shy, is he?

8
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:46,433
No. I'm Katherine Wright.
I live upstairs.

9
00:01:46,467 --> 00:01:50,100
Hi. I'm Lisa Haynes,
downstairs.

10
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:52,267
Sorry. He just likes
to stick his little nose
into everything.

11
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,600
Don't you, Jake?

12
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:55,367
Well, he probably
smells friends.

13
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,767
Friends?
Yeah.

14
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,367
Oh! Oh.
Goodness, Jakie, look.

15
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,767
Look!
Yeah.

16
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,767
They are so precious.

17
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,067
I know, right? I was
only going to get one,

18
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,533
but then I saw the litter
and there were eight of them.

19
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:12,433
Eight puppies.

20
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:15,067
Yeah. These three
were the closest.

21
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:17,933
This is Mario, Luigi,
and Pasquale.

22
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:20,900
Hello. Hello.
I didn't have the heart
to separate 'em.

23
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,067
Aw!
Oh, Jake.

24
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:24,333
[Jake barks]

25
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:31,667
So, anyway,
she called last week,
and they're engaged.

26
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,900
Oh, wow.
Yeah.

27
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:34,567
Congratulations.

28
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,667
Michael's such
a sweet guy, too.

29
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,533
They're going
this Christmas to be
with his parents in Idaho,

30
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:42,367
so, Rod and me--
Rod's my husband--

31
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,667
it'll be our first
Christmas away from home.

32
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,700
Aw.

33
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:51,200
Well, for me,
home is, um--

34
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:52,667
Hmm...

35
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,700
Home is here. Now.

36
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:57,067
So does that mean you're
spending Christmas here?

37
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,833
Yeah. Yeah.
My mom travels a lot.

38
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:01,633
She's actually in Spain
for a few months.

39
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,500
That's nice.
What does she do?

40
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:08,167
As far as I can tell,
enjoy herself thoroughly.

41
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,067
What about your dad?

42
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:14,100
He, uh-- He passed away
when I was in college.

43
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:16,567
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's okay.

44
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
It was a long time ago.

45
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:22,500
He-- He left my mom and sister
and I when I was a kid,

46
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:25,800
so he was never really
in the picture.

47
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:31,067
Wow! Look at that.

48
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,233
Oh...

49
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:35,233
Wow.

50
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:43,367
You okay?

51
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,800
Yeah.

52
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,133
Yeah, I'm fine.

53
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:51,500
It's just, um...

54
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:52,867
my ex.

55
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:57,933
I thought I threw out
all the pictures.

56
00:03:57,967 --> 00:04:00,400
Guess that one
slipped by you, huh?

57
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:02,467
When you were packing.

58
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:04,933
Maybe.

59
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,633
Maybe you
liked the frame?

60
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,067
Yeah. That's probably it.

61
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:16,367
You know, you want me to just
slip that out of the frame

62
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,733
and throw that picture out?

63
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:19,700
No!

64
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:24,200
No. Thank you. It's...

65
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:26,333
You're not over him.

66
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,333
What? No.

67
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:30,233
No, no, no. It's...

68
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:33,200
No, no, no, no, no.
No, ahh.

69
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:35,633
No, I am, I am.
I'm over him. Trust me.

70
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:37,333
It's just, um...

71
00:04:38,933 --> 00:04:40,467
It's just complicated.

72
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:47,200
We were friends forever.

73
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:49,133
Like, kids?

74
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:51,467
Like five years old.

75
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,900
That's a long time.

76
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:54,100
Yeah.

77
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:59,067
You know, he, um,

78
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:02,467
he didn't work up the courage
to ask me out until college.

79
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,467
We wound up going
to the same school, so...

80
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,800
We dated for a few years
after graduation,

81
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,067
but, um...

82
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,200
I guess we figured something
better would come along,

83
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,267
so we broke it off.

84
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,067
And, um... did it?

85
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,933
[clears throat]
Excuse me?

86
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:32,867
Did something better
come along?

87
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:39,267
I'm sorry.
That is none of my business.

88
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,533
No. No, no, no.
It's fine.

89
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:48,333
You know,
at the end of the day,
he and I were just...

90
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:53,333
Puppy love.

91
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,633
You know, I should probably
get back and make Rod dinner.

92
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:00,367
I want you to come
meet him soon.

93
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,067
Yeah, I'd love that.

94
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:04,100
And hey,
thank you for helping me.
Oh, no problem.

95
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:07,267
If you ever need anyone to
walk Jake, please let me know.

96
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,067
I'll take you up on that.
Perfect.

97
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:11,333
Welcome to
the neighborhood, Lisa.

98
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:13,267
Thank you.
Come on, old man.

99
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,600
Come on.

100
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,933
There you go.
Upstairs. Upstairs.

101
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,567
[door shuts]

102
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:46,967
[ball bouncing]

103
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:00,500
It's all in the wrist.
In the wrist?

104
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:01,667
Yeah.

105
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,800
Thank you.
All right.

106
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:08,567
Helped
my concentration.

107
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,100
[chuckles]
You got a good shot for, um...

108
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:13,200
For what?

109
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,567
Oh, you know.

110
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,433
No, I don't know.
What?

111
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:19,567
Uh, for, for...

112
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,733
An old guy.

113
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:22,600
[both laugh]

114
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:24,767
I don't mean
any disrespect.

115
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,067
I mean, are you 65?

116
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:27,933
Do I look 65?
No!

117
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:33,167
No, no. You look, um...
'Cause your shot is great.

118
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,600
And you...

119
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:37,200
I mean, you're obviously
in good shape. 40.

120
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:38,533
Tops.

121
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:41,267
[laughs]
Thank you. Thank you.

122
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,200
Your age is
none of my business.

123
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:46,600
I've seen you around.

124
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,433
It's just usually
someone of your...

125
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:51,067
My age?

126
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:54,200
No. Wisdom and experience.
Usually on the golf course.

127
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:58,867
Oh, golf.
Well, when I moved here
after I retired,

128
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,833
I thought I'd try golf,
but you know,

129
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:03,900
golf bored...out of me
before I was retired.

130
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:05,633
I couldn't watch it
on television.

131
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:08,700
I used to like basketball.
Figured I'd try that.

132
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,300
May I?
Sure.

133
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,300
Wow.

134
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,300
I played in college.

135
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,933
I'm David Bennett.

136
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,567
Rod Wright, David.
Nice to meet you.
Yeah.

137
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:28,767
Did you go pro?

138
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,667
No. Probably because
I played bench mostly.

139
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,667
Horse?
Sure.

140
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,467
Yeah? All right.

141
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:37,733
Where did you bench,
at Duke?

142
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,600
No, I got a letter from them.
I went to State.

143
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:42,733
State? Why?

144
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:44,567
A girl I knew
went to State.
Oh.

145
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,900
Well, I married
a girl in college, too.

146
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:53,300
Didn't really work out
like that for me.

147
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,667
I'm... I'm sorry.

148
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,733
We haven't talked 
in a couple years.

149
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:01,200
I hear she still
lives in the area.

150
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:03,467
A lot like
my basketball career.

151
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:08,367
Over.

152
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:17,567
Absolutely, Anna.
No. Not at all.

153
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,500
We are fine.

154
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:21,500
We'll be fine.

155
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:24,900
Sweetheart, I love you, too.

156
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:28,200
And be sure to give
Mitch our love, okay?

157
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:31,633
Happy almost Christmas.

158
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:33,600
Yeah. Bye.

159
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:37,133
You okay?

160
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,133
Yeah. Yeah.

161
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:45,500
So, you had a really good day
today with that boy?

162
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:47,633
Uh, huh. David.

163
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:50,467
Yeah, yeah.
Well, he seems
like a nice kid.

164
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,067
I can't remember the last time
I had a pick-up game of horse
with some random kid.

165
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,500
You were probably
a kid.

166
00:09:57,533 --> 00:09:59,400
Yeah, I probably was.

167
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,733
So? Did you win?

168
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,733
This is good.
What was this?

169
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:05,733
[laughs]

170
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:08,467
You know that girl
downstairs? Lisa?
Mm-hmm.

171
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,633
She's a really,
really nice girl.

172
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:15,400
Yeah, is she? Look at us,
making new friends
with young people.

173
00:10:15,433 --> 00:10:18,333
Oh, and Rod.
You should see her puppies.

174
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,500
Yeah, puppies.
She's got puppies.

175
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:22,000
Our puppy's getting
pretty big, isn't he?

176
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:24,533
I wonder why.
Don't feed him.

177
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:26,700
Okay. All right.
Down, Jake.

178
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,633
Anyway, she said she's 
going to look after Jake

179
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:30,567
when we're with
Jim and Patty tomorrow.

180
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,633
That's good.

181
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:38,533
So, um, you say this
David is a nice guy?

182
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:40,367
I think so. I don't know.

183
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,667
He seems to be
from what I could tell,
playing a game of horse.

184
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,800
Is he single?

185
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:49,567
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

186
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,467
It's kind of
a coincidence, isn't it?

187
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,233
You meet a really nice boy.
I met a really nice girl.

188
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:56,533
Today, on the same day.
Yeah.

189
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:58,767
Are you getting bored
with this retirement stuff?

190
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:04,233
No. I'm...

191
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:07,133
I'm having a great time.

192
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,400
You are?
Yeah, you know.

193
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:14,567
Jim and Patty.
The beach. The bikinis.

194
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,267
The, uh, pick-up
basketball games.

195
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,900
Bikinis.

196
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,567
Come on, come on.
Let's go this way.

197
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,100
Let's go this way.
Wait for the other puppy.

198
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:37,100
Hi.

199
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,600
[puppies whining]

200
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,267
David?

201
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,300
[barking]

202
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:04,300
[squeals]

203
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,133
There's, um, there's something
I've been wanting to ask you.

204
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:08,267
Right.

205
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:13,667
No. No, no, no.
Jake. Jake, no.

206
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,500
No, you can't
go out there. 
[barking]

207
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:19,667
There's chocolate and glass
and other bad stuff. No, no!

208
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,233
Jake, stop! Stop!

209
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:22,900
Jake, no. No!

210
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:24,733
No, no, no, no!
Come back here!

211
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:28,300
No. Come back here! Jake!

212
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,567
[screams]

213
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,067
Sorry. Jake, Jake, Jake!
Guys, guys.

214
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:33,200
Hey.

215
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:36,067
[chuckles]
All right. Okay.

216
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:37,200
Oh.

217
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:39,633
Jake. Come on.
Are you okay?

218
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:42,067
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.
I'm okay. I'm okay.

219
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,900
I am so, so sorry, David.

220
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:45,667
Lisa.

221
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,233
Yeah.

222
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,800
Wait, Lisa...

223
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,700
Lisa? Lisa-Lisa?

224
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:53,633
Well, just one Lisa.

225
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,500
Hi.

226
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:58,800
Well, I've heard
so much about you.

227
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,300
Really?

228
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,933
This is Kelly, my, um...

229
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:04,467
Girlfriend.

230
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,967
It's nice to meet you. Hi.

231
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:08,433
Hello.
Where did it go?

232
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:10,633
What?
The bag. A little velvet bag
with the engagement ring.

233
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:11,633
Engagement ring?
Engagement ring?

234
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,100
Aunt Pearl's ring.

235
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:14,900
Aunt Pearl's ring?
Who's Aunt Pearl?

236
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:16,267
I don't see this anywhere.

237
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,567
I'll help you look.
I'll find it.

238
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,433
You've done enough.
Excuse me?

239
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:21,067
Maybe you should just go.
Yeah, maybe.

240
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,400
It's not like I
did this on purpose.

241
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:23,633
[chuckles]

242
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:25,600
Are you serious?

243
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:27,133
I'm about to propose,

244
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,767
and you sic a pack
of wild dogs on me?

245
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,600
Is something going on
between you two

246
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:32,767
that maybe you should
think about telling me?
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,200
I'm just going to go.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go.

248
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:38,767
Yes, go. No! Wait!
You don't go. Her go.
Where are you going?

249
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,400
What is going on?

250
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:44,767
Okay. Mario. Luigi.
Pasquale. Mario?

251
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,967
Mario!

252
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:47,567
Mario!

253
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Mario!

254
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:50,100
Mario!

255
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:58,100
Okay, Aunt Lis, I post this
in my profile, too?

256
00:13:58,133 --> 00:14:00,667
Oh, why was I so stupid?

257
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,667
I should have never
taken my eyes off of him.

258
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,100
He's only a puppy.
I mean, how far could
he have really gotten?

259
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:07,100
Yeah, but I didn't even
get his tags done yet.

260
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:08,700
I'm sure she's right,
sweetheart.

261
00:14:08,733 --> 00:14:11,067
Somebody's probably
found him by now.
[knocking]

262
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,933
Look. See?
Rod.

263
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:16,900
I got your note.
I bumped into David outside.

264
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:19,200
David.

265
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:22,333
Interesting.

266
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:25,067
Yeah. David, this is my wife
Katherine, and, uh...

267
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,067
That's Lisa and Myra.

268
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,067
[barks]

269
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:30,667
And that's Jake.

270
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,600
Yeah, we met.

271
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:35,067
Yeah, you look
kind of familiar.

272
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,067
Um...

273
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:43,100
Oh!

274
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,267
So you didn't bring him.

275
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,600
What?

276
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:49,233
What do you want, Dave?
Myra!

277
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,167
Let me handle this,
please. Thank you.

278
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,700
Unless you have the dog,
you should just go.

279
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:58,067
It's a very
fragile time.
Okay.

280
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,133
Okay, all right. Hi.

281
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:03,233
Why don't you take
Luigi and Pasquale
and go outside and play?

282
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Yeah, we should
get going, too.

283
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,333
I just got here.

284
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:09,100
So, Jake-- Oh.

285
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:10,900
Oh, I'm sorry.

286
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,400
[Katherine]
I'm so sorry.

287
00:15:14,433 --> 00:15:16,667
He's just-- He's really
stubborn sometimes.

288
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,167
Come on, Jake.

289
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,167
Whats going on?

290
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,067
I'll explain
when we get home.

291
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:24,067
Nice to meet you, David.
Yeah, you, too.

292
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:35,600
Um, I guess, uh, you still
haven't found your puppy.

293
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:38,733
No. Look, David,
about this morning, I--

294
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:40,300
No, I was out of line.

295
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,333
That I did it on purpose?
Well, I didn't--

296
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:44,067
I didn't say that exactly.

297
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:46,400
Well, you didn't have to.
You gave me that look.

298
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:48,467
What look?
That look you do. That...

299
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,167
That look right there!
Okay. Okay, look.
To be fair--

300
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,067
I know. I know.
You're right. I know.

301
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:56,400
It seemed like
a planned operation,

302
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:59,067
but as strange as it seems,

303
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,200
my intentions were not
to sabotage your proposal,

304
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:04,567
lose my puppy
and Aunt Pearl's ring.

305
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,167
I had it all planned out.

306
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,233
I was going to
tell her the story,

307
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:12,733
and you of all people know
the story and how important
that ring is to me.

308
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:15,133
When did Aunt Pearl
give you the ring?

309
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:20,067
She died last year.

310
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:21,100
Oh.

311
00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:24,600
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

312
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:27,967
Why didn't you
say something?

313
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:33,533
We hadn't spoke in forever.

314
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:36,067
What was I going to do,
call you up and say,

315
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:39,967
"Hey, how you doin'?
By the way, Aunt Pearl died."

316
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:43,800
Well, if that's how you would
have went about it, then no.

317
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:49,067
Still the same David.

318
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,633
[Lisa]
So... engaged.
Congratulations.

319
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:54,733
I'm assuming the ring's
just a formality.

320
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:56,533
[chuckles]

321
00:16:56,567 --> 00:17:00,867
As huge as a problem as that is,
it's the least of my worries.

322
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:05,100
Kelly still thinks that
there's something between us.

323
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:07,933
What?

324
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:10,100
What in the world
gave her that idea?

325
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:14,267
When you finally
work up the nerve

326
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,567
to propose to a woman
that you want to spend
the rest of your life with,

327
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,533
you expect tears
followed by,

328
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:24,633
"Yes, yes,
a thousand times, yes."

329
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:28,100
You don't expect
your ex-girlfriend's dogs

330
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:30,400
to knock you over and
leave you standing there--

331
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:32,400
Okay, I get it. Uh...

332
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:34,900
Am I going to have
to hire a skywriter
to apologize for this?

333
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:38,767
I just need you
to explain to her
that it's over between us.

334
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,933
What? She doesn't
believe you?

335
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:41,767
She just wants to
hear it from you.

336
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,600
Why?
Because.

337
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:47,400
She doesn't know
all the stuff.

338
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,567
What stuff?

339
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,933
You know, stuff.
Stuff that you said.

340
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:54,933
I don't even remember.

341
00:17:57,733 --> 00:18:00,333
Uh, hmm. All right.

342
00:18:00,367 --> 00:18:02,600
Let's see.

343
00:18:02,633 --> 00:18:03,967
I'm immature.

344
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:07,200
Uh... Oh!
I can't commit.

345
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:09,333
Is that what I said?

346
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:12,100
"You're never
going to change.

347
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,500
We might as well
call this what it is, David.

348
00:18:14,533 --> 00:18:17,700
I love you, but I'm not
in love with you.
Okay, okay! I get it.

349
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:22,467
You should find somebody else."
It's all starting to
come back to me. Thanks.

350
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,467
Lis.

351
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,500
I found somebody else.

352
00:18:32,867 --> 00:18:36,133
Okay. Yeah. I...

353
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,133
I'll talk to her.

354
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:45,100
But I'm super busy this week,
so I don't know.

355
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:50,100
You still working
at Helkin and Meyer?

356
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:52,933
For all your
public relation needs.

357
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:56,067
How about you?
Still trying to figure out
what to do with yourself?

358
00:18:56,067 --> 00:19:00,267
No, I finally
completed my MBA,

359
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,367
and I took a job as
a senior vice president
over at Quantifund.

360
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,167
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Completed your MBA?

361
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:15,267
Gotta grow up sometime, right?

362
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,267
Yeah, I guess so.

363
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,267
Wow.

364
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,533
Congrats. I'm...

365
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:23,800
I'm impressed.

366
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,567
So you'll talk to Kelly.

367
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,233
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.
I'll-- I'll fix it.

368
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:38,467
Yeah.

369
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:45,233
Hey! And, uh...

370
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,267
um...

371
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,067
good luck finding the ring.

372
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,200
And good luck
finding your puppy.

373
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,067
[mouthing]

374
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:31,500
[Lisa] So what's his name?
[Myra]
His name's Freddie Donavan,

375
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:34,100
and he's always following me
and thinks I don't notice,
but I do.

376
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:37,500
And he's always asking me
stupid stuff.

377
00:20:37,533 --> 00:20:39,333
What do you mean,
stupid stuff?

378
00:20:39,367 --> 00:20:41,833
Like, you know,
"What page is this on?

379
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:44,000
What did you think
of that quiz?"

380
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:46,367
I swear to God,
he hit puberty

381
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,900
and forgot how to conduct
a decent conversation.

382
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:51,100
I mean, he's so nervous.

383
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:53,267
Do you like him?
Oh, here you go.

384
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,600
He clearly likes me, right?

385
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:57,833
So what's the problem?

386
00:20:57,867 --> 00:21:00,833
Aunt Lis, come on.
You of all people
should understand

387
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:03,433
how hard it is for me
to think romantically

388
00:21:03,467 --> 00:21:05,633
about a guy I used to
finger-paint with
in kindergarten.

389
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:07,233
Me of all people?

390
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:08,667
Well, from what I gather,

391
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,933
that's ultimately why
you broke up with David.

392
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:13,333
He's a cute, sweet guy,

393
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:15,433
and even though
you tried for a while,

394
00:21:15,467 --> 00:21:17,733
you just see him as a guy
you used to finger-paint with.

395
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:20,333
You know what? I don't even
know what you're talking about.

396
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:22,067
No idea. No clue.

397
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,333
Shoot!

398
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:28,233
Wait. What?
Who's that?

399
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:29,567
Unbelievable.

400
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,800
Lisa-Lisa.
Ruined my engagement Lisa.

401
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,167
It's Kelly.
Who?

402
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,933
It's David's fiancée.
Well, girlfriend.

403
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:41,733
Well, I don't know.
I don't care.

404
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,433
Can she see me?

405
00:21:43,467 --> 00:21:46,467
No. She's kind of
going off to her friends.

406
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,833
[gasps]
She just said
you were a ditch.

407
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:49,833
[gasps]

408
00:21:49,867 --> 00:21:51,133
What does that mean?

409
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:52,467
Yeah, I think she saw you.

410
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,067
Shoot! All right.

411
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,600
You can't blame her, right?
You expect this kind of thing
from a rebound.

412
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:01,833
No, Myra.
She's not a rebound.
They're getting engaged.

413
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:04,967
Well, not without that ring,
they aren't.

414
00:22:05,067 --> 00:22:06,167
Well played, Aunt Lis.

415
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
Well played.

416
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:10,333
Oh, God. Not you, too.

417
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:13,500
I'm not interested in David.
Besides, I'm a grown woman.

418
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,700
Do you really think
I would stoop to
something so immature?

419
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:18,300
Yeah, you are hiding
behind a wall.

420
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:22,100
Okay.
[clears throat]

421
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:28,733
There she is.

422
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:31,167
Okay, so I'll...
I'm gonna do this.

423
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,567
What's the big deal?
She's a little thing.
I think you could take her.

424
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,733
Myra, we're not gonna fight.
David wants me to talk to her.

425
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:40,367
About what?

426
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,067
She thinks I still love him.

427
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,733
Ooh! Do you?

428
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:47,400
He wants to marry
someone else.

429
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:49,667
Right, right.
And he did not
want to marry you

430
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,500
after all those years
of friendship.

431
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:53,700
Ooh, that's gotta sting.

432
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:56,733
Especially since
he's only known that one
for about five minutes.

433
00:22:56,767 --> 00:23:00,567
Okay, you know what?
You're really getting
on my nerves.

434
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,433
I'm gonna stay.
You're not.

435
00:23:02,467 --> 00:23:05,567
I need you to take the puppies
and meet me back at my place.

436
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,700
I kinda like to see
how you handle this.
I get it, but no.

437
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:09,367
Just go. Just go. Thank you.

438
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,700
See ya.
Yeah.

439
00:23:15,467 --> 00:23:17,900
Hi.
Hello. Hey.

440
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,467
Well, I'm glad that
she took those away.

441
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,800
I'd hate for someone else
around here to get attacked.

442
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:29,267
Oh, right. About that,
I'm really sorry.

443
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:33,067
It was such a beautiful morning
until you ruined it.

444
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,633
Yeah. Again,
I'm-- I'm really sorry,

445
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:38,967
but you do have to understand
that it was just an accident.

446
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:43,300
Hmm. After the fact,
I'm not exactly a dog person.

447
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:49,067
You gotta realize how
just conveniently weird 
this whole thing was.

448
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:51,100
No, yeah. Totally.
I guess so.

449
00:23:51,133 --> 00:23:55,500
But I think you're blowing it
a little bit out of proportion.

450
00:23:56,933 --> 00:23:59,400
Look, he told me
how close you two were.

451
00:23:59,433 --> 00:24:03,067
Yeah, but he also must have
also said that we haven't
spoken in a couple years.

452
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,667
He did.

453
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,533
We've moved on,
obviously.

454
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:09,300
Well, it didn't look
like that on the beach.
Oh, no, no.

455
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:12,467
We've totally moved on.
Why would you think that?

456
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,433
Because you're
the ideal, Lisa.

457
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:19,633
You don't have any idea,
do you, how difficult it is

458
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,800
to compete with
a thousand memories?

459
00:24:24,467 --> 00:24:27,367
Kelly, he wants to marry you.

460
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,133
There isn't anything
going on between us.

461
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:31,833
I promise.

462
00:24:31,867 --> 00:24:34,167
So you don't have
any feelings for him?

463
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:39,633
Okay, all right.
He's just the guy
I used to finger-paint with.

464
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:42,967
I don't think I like
the sound of that.
No, no, no!

465
00:24:43,067 --> 00:24:46,667
When you're kids,
like at school.
Look, it's stupid.

466
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,700
Look, we're just friends.

467
00:24:48,733 --> 00:24:49,767
Mm-hmm.

468
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,167
It didn't work out. Okay?

469
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,267
I don't want to be with him.
I want him to be with you.

470
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,333
I'm not in love
with him anymore.

471
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:06,833
I'm cool with everything.

472
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:08,067
You're cool
with everything.

473
00:25:08,067 --> 00:25:10,700
I'm cool with everything.

474
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:14,833
We're over.
He's yours now.

475
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,867
Okay.

476
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,567
Okay.
Yeah.

477
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,267
Okay.
Okay.

478
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,833
All right.

479
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:27,067
I'm going to apologize
to you now.

480
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,900
I'm sorry.

481
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:34,833
I mean,
I really went psycho
on you there. Whoa!

482
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,233
But you understand
where I was coming from.

483
00:25:37,267 --> 00:25:39,267
Yes! No, of course,
of course.

484
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,567
It's like, first of all,
I feel like I know you.

485
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,067
And that's really weird.

486
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:45,400
That is really weird,
because you just hugged me,

487
00:25:45,433 --> 00:25:47,667
and I feel like
I don't know you at all.

488
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,500
Gee whiz.
So we're even-Steven
on the weird.

489
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:53,067
Well, listen.

490
00:25:53,067 --> 00:25:55,167
Truth revealed,
big relief.

491
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,400
Well, I'm-- I'm glad.
[sighs]

492
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:01,100
And between you and I,

493
00:26:01,133 --> 00:26:04,633
regarding the whole
dog attack,

494
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:07,933
listen, I should actually
be thanking you.

495
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:09,733
Thank me?

496
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:12,433
Well, of course
I want to get engaged,

497
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:16,467
but I just,
I feel kind of funny

498
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,133
with the whole Aunt Pearl
ring situation.

499
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:22,633
Kind of funny?

500
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:27,467
Yeah, I mean, after the mess
at the beach that you caused,

501
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,900
David sat me down,
and he told me a story,

502
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:32,333
and it was cute, kind of.

503
00:26:32,367 --> 00:26:34,433
But the truth of it is,

504
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,300
Aunt Pearl's ring is
actually just this old--

505
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,233
Oh, it's a cheap ring.

506
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:41,767
Yeah, well...

507
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,467
Exactly. Well.

508
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,600
And so maybe
now that it's gone,

509
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:49,933
he'll have the sense enough
to get me a real ring.

510
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:51,267
A real ring?

511
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,433
Yes. You know,
something with value.

512
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:58,333
Kelly!

513
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,200
Okay, Lainie's
getting impatient.

514
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:06,567
So, um, I, for one, am glad
that we had this talk.

515
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,667
Yeah, me, too.

516
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,300
Me, too.
Mm-hmm.

517
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:10,767
Mm-hmm.

518
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,667
Can you help me find
my aunt's dog? Please?
Thank you.

519
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,933
Freddie Donovan? Oh, no.
Not happening.

520
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:25,967
Oh, sir! Sir!

521
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:28,100
Can you help me find
my aunt's puppy?

522
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,933
Can you please help me find
my puppy Mario? Thank you.

523
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:57,633
Hey, Jakie boy.

524
00:27:57,667 --> 00:27:59,833
The pups are out with Myra,
looking for Mario.

525
00:27:59,867 --> 00:28:01,767
You haven't seen him,
have you?

526
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,900
All right, well, thanks
for keeping an eye out.

527
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:10,700
Oh! Well, make yourself at home.

528
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:13,200
Can I get you something?
How about kibble?

529
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:16,100
Oh, how about a beer, hmm?

530
00:28:16,133 --> 00:28:18,300
Well, I don't have any beer.

531
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:21,733
Hey. Hey, what do you
have there?

532
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:23,500
Wait, come here.
Where you going?

533
00:28:26,133 --> 00:28:27,500
Jake!

534
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:37,600
Hey, stop. Stop. Stop.

535
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:38,733
What are you doing to me?

536
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:40,367
No, Jake. Stop. Stop.

537
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,867
Jake, stop it!

538
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,067
Come here. Come Back.

539
00:28:45,067 --> 00:28:48,067
Jake! Jake, Jake, Jake.

540
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,733
Jake, Jake.
What are you doing?
Son of a...

541
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:54,400
Ohh! Oh, God,
I'm so sorry.

542
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,367
It's my fault. My fault.

543
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,667
Lis.

544
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,733
David.

545
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,767
Is this your dog?
[whimpering]

546
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,067
Is this your suit?

547
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,267
Yeah. I have
a few of them now.

548
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,833
You're wearing suits now?

549
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:09,067
Yeah, I told you I was
a senior vice president.

550
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,067
Yeah, I guess I didn't
actually believe it.

551
00:29:12,067 --> 00:29:14,600
That sounded a lot
better in my head.

552
00:29:14,633 --> 00:29:15,933
So this is your dog?

553
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:17,833
Rod and Katherine's.
My neighbors. Yeah.

554
00:29:17,867 --> 00:29:20,767
He's a real handful,
that one. Can't sit still.

555
00:29:23,467 --> 00:29:25,467
Yeah, I can see that.

556
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,833
[whimpering]

557
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:29,200
He was rooting
through my stuff and...

558
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,967
[chuckles]
Oh!

559
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:35,467
I always wondered
where this went.

560
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,167
Where did you--
How did you wind up
with it? Oh.

561
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,900
Was it that...
that concert!

562
00:29:40,933 --> 00:29:42,967
That's right.

563
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:45,167
[together]
The Big Swampland
Outdoor Music Fest.

564
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,733
Summer after senior year.
Yeah.
[laughs]

565
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:53,767
Remember? I spilled.
That margarita.
On the front of your shirt.

566
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,933
And this was in
your back seat.

567
00:29:56,967 --> 00:29:58,100
My back seat.

568
00:29:58,133 --> 00:29:59,267
Yeah.

569
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:03,133
That was a fun night.

570
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:07,767
Kelly...
Yeah.

571
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,100
Um, said that you were great.

572
00:30:11,133 --> 00:30:12,433
Oh, she did?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

573
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:13,800
Said you guys had
a good little chat,

574
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,233
told me all about it,

575
00:30:15,267 --> 00:30:17,967
and that you were
cool with everything.

576
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,767
Well, now you can
pop the question.

577
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,633
Really wish
I had that ring.

578
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:26,167
I'm sure she'll say
yes without it.

579
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,733
You think so?

580
00:30:27,767 --> 00:30:30,333
So how'd you two meet,
anyway?

581
00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:32,800
Uh, you know, a work mixer.

582
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,733
A work mixer?

583
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:37,233
Yeah. It's not how I thought
I would meet my wife,

584
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:40,833
but there she was,
very gorgeous and sweet.

585
00:30:40,867 --> 00:30:43,567
Funny.
[car beeps]

586
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,600
Sounds like someone I know.

587
00:30:46,633 --> 00:30:47,900
Except the sweet part.

588
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:49,300
[laughs]

589
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,300
You know, I...

590
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:55,300
We haven't spoken
in a really long time,

591
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:58,733
but I thought now that
I'm marrying somebody else,

592
00:30:58,767 --> 00:31:01,867
maybe we could be
friends again.

593
00:31:03,367 --> 00:31:06,433
David, we were never
not friends.

594
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,867
Great. Then I'll put you
on the invitation list.

595
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,500
You haven't even proposed.
You already have a list?

596
00:31:14,533 --> 00:31:18,200
A list, a floor plan, menus.

597
00:31:18,233 --> 00:31:20,367
Kelly's got wedding fever.

598
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,367
She's been looking
for good spots for years.

599
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,300
Wow. Yeah, you guys are in
quite a hurry, aren't you?

600
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:28,367
We're in love.

601
00:31:30,067 --> 00:31:31,400
It's like you said,
when you know,

602
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:33,800
You know.
you know.

603
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:35,700
I said a lot of stuff there
at the end, didn't I?

604
00:31:35,733 --> 00:31:38,067
Water under the bridge.

605
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,667
Uh, yeah, I should
probably get him back.

606
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,300
Katherine's
probably worried.

607
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:47,367
Yeah.

608
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,467
Come on, Jake.

609
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,133
I think he likes me.
Come on.

610
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:52,967
I don't think
he wants to go.

611
00:31:53,067 --> 00:31:54,200
Huh, yeah.

612
00:31:55,367 --> 00:31:56,767
Hey, Lis.
Yeah?

613
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,400
Thanks.

614
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,267
Hiya, Freddie.

615
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,900
Oh, hey, Myra.

616
00:32:19,933 --> 00:32:21,433
Here, let me
help you with that.

617
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:22,400
Thank you.

618
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:27,300
Hey, guys.
What are their names?

619
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:30,433
Oh. That's Luigi
with the blue collar,

620
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:33,233
and that's Pasquale
with the black collar.

621
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:36,267
Hi, Pasquale.
Hi, Luigi.

622
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,967
I saw you a little earlier.

623
00:32:39,067 --> 00:32:41,233
Wh-What are you
talking about?

624
00:32:41,267 --> 00:32:43,700
When you were following me.

625
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:45,267
I don't know what...

626
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,767
I saw you following me,
Freddie. What's up?

627
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,267
Are these your puppies?

628
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,433
No, they're my aunt's.
She's missing one and--

629
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:55,667
Oh, you haven't seen
another one around, have you?

630
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,467
When you know,
you know, he says?

631
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,933
He's using my own
words against me.

632
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:07,300
He didn't know with me.
That's what he's saying.

633
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:11,067
I don't care. I'm not jealous.
He can marry whoever he wants.

634
00:33:11,067 --> 00:33:12,533
It's the principle
of the thing.

635
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:15,200
And don't you defend him.
I know you like him. Oh.

636
00:33:15,233 --> 00:33:16,800
What a relief.

637
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:21,267
Yeah, I'm sorry.
He came in and just ran off.

638
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,967
He ran off?

639
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,600
Yeah, um...
Jake.

640
00:33:24,633 --> 00:33:28,133
Very weird.
But he's a smart guy.

641
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:31,433
Yeah. I guess it runs
in the family. Come on.

642
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:34,133
Hey, um...

643
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:35,933
Do you have a second?

644
00:33:37,867 --> 00:33:39,633
Hey, Rod.

645
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:42,200
Hey, David.
How are you, man?

646
00:33:42,233 --> 00:33:44,967
Don't look like you're
dressed for basketball.

647
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:47,467
No, going to my girlfriend's.
Fiancée's.

648
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,167
No, girlfriend's house.

649
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,300
You having a little trouble
making up your mind here?

650
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:54,867
Lisa, right?
What?

651
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,600
The girl that
lives downstairs.

652
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:59,100
No. No, no, no. No.

653
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:01,367
She's old--
Well, she's an ex.

654
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,600
She's a lot like
my basketball career thing.

655
00:34:03,633 --> 00:34:05,267
Over.
Exactly.

656
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,167
That's too bad.
Yeah.

657
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,700
You looked like
a nice couple.

658
00:34:09,733 --> 00:34:13,300
Ah. I'm starting to
sound like my wife.

659
00:34:18,067 --> 00:34:21,867
Let me ask you something.
How long you been married?

660
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,833
Forty years.

661
00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:28,667
My Uncle Matt was married
to my Aunt Pearl for 65.

662
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,567
They officially
met in high school.

663
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:36,367
But apparently Uncle Matt
had his eye on Aunt Pearl
since the seventh grade

664
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,333
and had a hard time
working up the nerve
to approach her.

665
00:34:39,367 --> 00:34:41,700
Remember those toy
vending machines?

666
00:34:41,733 --> 00:34:44,167
What, with the claw?

667
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,667
No, no, no claw.

668
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,500
The way he tells it,
it was just a vending machine.

669
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:50,667
And when Uncle Matt
got back from Korea...

670
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,333
He had like
a dime to his name.

671
00:34:54,367 --> 00:34:56,367
He looks into
the vending machine,

672
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,633
and he can just
barely make out the ring...

673
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:05,500
Wedged between a paddle
and one of those, um...

674
00:35:05,533 --> 00:35:07,567
Rubber balls and a top.

675
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,733
And the ring's just,
it's peeking out.

676
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:10,733
It was...

677
00:35:10,767 --> 00:35:11,800
Twinkling.

678
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:13,267
Twinkling?
Twinkling?

679
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,600
Twinkling.
That's what he said.

680
00:35:15,633 --> 00:35:17,567
He said it was...

681
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,467
Calling to him.

682
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,067
So he said...

683
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,067
I'm gonna get that ring
with this dime,

684
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,733
and when I do I'm going to ask
Pearl Nedermarker to marry me.

685
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:30,067
So he drops that dime
in the machine...

686
00:35:30,067 --> 00:35:31,400
And he turns the dial...

687
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:32,733
And out came the ring.

688
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:34,600
It's like a one
in a hundred shot.

689
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,900
Or however many toys
there were in the machine.

690
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:38,967
The point is...

691
00:35:39,067 --> 00:35:40,567
He willed it.

692
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,267
So he took it as a sign

693
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,567
and proposed to Aunt Pearl
that same night.

694
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,933
When Aunt Pearl passed,
she left me the ring.

695
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:01,400
David always loved that story.

696
00:36:01,433 --> 00:36:05,800
You see, Uncle Matt kind of
willed it to himself,

697
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:08,933
and I... I just lost it.

698
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:14,167
So I'm wondering...

699
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,967
You're not sure.

700
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,733
I mean, 40 years is
a long time, right?

701
00:36:20,767 --> 00:36:23,100
It's a blink of an eye, son.

702
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:30,333
What?

703
00:36:30,367 --> 00:36:32,367
My Uncle Matt used
to say the same thing.

704
00:36:34,533 --> 00:36:36,900
Well...

705
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:38,533
good luck.

706
00:36:51,467 --> 00:36:53,700
You know, maybe it's
none of my business,

707
00:36:53,733 --> 00:36:56,267
but I really do think
they're rushing into things.

708
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,633
I mean, I don't know how long
he's known this girl for.

709
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:00,767
Yeah, that is
important criteria.

710
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,167
And then what? All of a sudden
he proposes, just like that?

711
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,433
You trying to take
the finish off that?

712
00:37:07,467 --> 00:37:09,433
I should say
something to him,
don't you think?

713
00:37:09,467 --> 00:37:10,867
Yeah, I think so.

714
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,267
Yeah, I should march
over there and say,

715
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,933
"David, you're making
a terrible mistake.

716
00:37:16,967 --> 00:37:19,700
Aunt Pearl would not
approve of Kelly."

717
00:37:19,733 --> 00:37:21,433
Well, Aunt Pearl--

718
00:37:21,467 --> 00:37:23,067
Obviously he really
loved his Aunt Pearl.

719
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,200
I understand that,
sweetheart, but that's--

720
00:37:25,233 --> 00:37:29,233
And Aunt Pearl
really liked me.

721
00:37:29,267 --> 00:37:30,600
I'm telling you,
Katherine,

722
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:33,600
I don't know about
this Kelly girl.

723
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:36,400
Lisa.
Yeah.

724
00:37:36,433 --> 00:37:39,067
You still
in love with David?
What?

725
00:37:39,067 --> 00:37:42,733
Until the other day,
I hadn't even
thought about him.

726
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:45,567
He must have at least
crossed your mind

727
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,200
when you were packing
that picture.

728
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:50,800
Exactly what happened
with you two?

729
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:56,567
We broke up.
That's what happens.

730
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,233
I understand that you broke up,
but there must have been
a reason.

731
00:37:59,267 --> 00:38:01,400
Okay, so get this.
We're out one night,

732
00:38:01,433 --> 00:38:04,767
and I think-- well, I think--
he's about to pop the question

733
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,300
and then all of a sudden
he starts saying things like,

734
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:10,467
"Well, maybe, sorta,
I don't know.

735
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:15,633
Um, taking a break.
Seeing what's out there."
What?

736
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:18,233
So he broke up with you.

737
00:38:18,267 --> 00:38:20,567
Technically,
it was a mutual thing.

738
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,467
Because you know
what I told him?

739
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,300
"Oh, you want to see
what's out there?
Have at it."

740
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:28,300
That's what I said.

741
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:30,800
And so he found Kelly.

742
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:32,800
Kelly?
Yeah.

743
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:35,567
No. No, no, no, no, no.

744
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,167
He came running back to me
a month after,

745
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,067
saying he'd made
a terrible mistake.

746
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,967
You know what I told him?

747
00:38:42,067 --> 00:38:43,933
"You should've
thought about that
n the first place,"

748
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:46,100
and I didn't take him back.
That's what I said.

749
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:48,433
Oh. So you didn't
take him back.

750
00:38:48,467 --> 00:38:50,067
Well, I mean, I did,
eventually.

751
00:38:50,067 --> 00:38:52,567
Now I'm really
getting confused.

752
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,633
I think maybe you're
leaving something important out.

753
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,800
Well, I just...

754
00:39:00,767 --> 00:39:04,233
I just realized
that it was never
going to work out,

755
00:39:04,267 --> 00:39:09,667
so I told him
to get over me,

756
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,800
that I didn't
love him anymore.

757
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:13,800
Ouch.
I know.

758
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:16,567
It was a bit harsh.

759
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,633
But it was for the best.

760
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:22,067
Is that the way
that you really felt?

761
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,533
I don't know...
how I feel.

762
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:34,300
All I kept thinking
about was my dad.

763
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:36,867
I don't understand.

764
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:41,067
Here we have a guy
that was never around.

765
00:39:41,067 --> 00:39:43,567
Treated my mother terribly.

766
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,133
Obviously they had
some laughs,

767
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:50,067
but at some point,

768
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,867
I just never
saw her laughing.

769
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,833
Not ever?
Not with him. No.

770
00:39:55,867 --> 00:39:59,533
But then when--
when he died,

771
00:39:59,567 --> 00:40:01,300
it was like, whoosh!

772
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,800
Like the dam broke.

773
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:05,867
You should have seen
the way she was crying.

774
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,633
Didn't you cry, too?

775
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:14,300
A little, I guess.

776
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:17,867
I feel kind of bad
about it, but I...

777
00:40:19,267 --> 00:40:21,800
I didn't really know him.

778
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:25,733
But I asked her...

779
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:31,333
"Why in the world are
you crying so hard,
and for him?"

780
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:38,833
And she told me,
with tears in her eyes...

781
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:43,767
"He was my first love."

782
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,633
I guess I'll never
get over that.

783
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:55,000
I love my mom, but I decided
right there and then

784
00:40:55,033 --> 00:40:58,133
that I was not going
to fall hard for David.

785
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:03,067
[sighs]
So you just decided

786
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,867
that you weren't going
to fall in love with him.

787
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,233
Well, yeah.
You know what I mean.

788
00:41:08,267 --> 00:41:13,400
I had to protect myself
from something that was
never going to work.

789
00:41:13,433 --> 00:41:18,200
Well, if you just
decided that...

790
00:41:21,067 --> 00:41:25,167
then why do you care whether
he marries Kelly or not?

791
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:36,933
Freddie,
I don't know what to say.

792
00:41:36,967 --> 00:41:39,100
I mean,
you really came through.

793
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:40,367
I did?

794
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,933
You really did.

795
00:41:47,733 --> 00:41:50,067
Oh, there was something else.

796
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:55,767
What's the matter?
You've never seen
two people kiss before?

797
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,067
[door closes]

798
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:02,700
Whoa. Freddie, slow down.
It was just a kiss.

799
00:42:02,733 --> 00:42:03,833
Shut up.

800
00:42:03,867 --> 00:42:06,367
It was around his neck.

801
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,833
Oh, my God!
That's right!

802
00:42:08,867 --> 00:42:11,833
David lost his ring.
This must be it.

803
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:20,267
Mario, did you take
that ring on purpose?

804
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,333
[whimpers]

805
00:42:23,233 --> 00:42:24,833
I say bury it.

806
00:42:24,867 --> 00:42:26,600
I can't do that.

807
00:42:26,633 --> 00:42:29,200
From what you said,
she won't care, right?

808
00:42:29,233 --> 00:42:30,267
True.

809
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,300
[horn honks]

810
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:33,167
Oh, that's my mom.

811
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,333
Well, thanks so much
for finding Mario.

812
00:42:37,367 --> 00:42:41,100
Oh, that's okay. I'll accept
my reward in installments.

813
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:43,967
Wait. It seems to me

814
00:42:44,067 --> 00:42:46,867
that Freddie should be
the one getting the reward.

815
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,767
Oh! Oh!

816
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,333
I think he already
got his reward, huh?

817
00:42:53,367 --> 00:42:55,700
Are you blushing?
You are.

818
00:42:55,733 --> 00:42:57,667
You're blushing.
You're blushing.

819
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,700
You have to tell me.
Wait! No.

820
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,900
[horn honks]

821
00:43:03,933 --> 00:43:05,067
[door shuts]

822
00:43:34,533 --> 00:43:37,600
42,776 real crystals.

823
00:43:37,633 --> 00:43:39,267
Oh, my God!

824
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,600
Okay! Ohh!

825
00:43:41,633 --> 00:43:44,867
It's like a fantasy!
A fantasy come true!

826
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,700
David, can you imagine?

827
00:43:51,933 --> 00:43:55,233
Yeah, here.
Yes, absolutely.

828
00:43:55,267 --> 00:43:57,900
Of course,
maybe they won't come.
Maybe just...

829
00:44:14,067 --> 00:44:16,967
Tanya, you're gonna
seriously turn it out.

830
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,567
[Jake whines]
[Katherine]
Evening, Lis.

831
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,967
Hey, guys.
Taking the big man
for an evening stroll?

832
00:45:09,067 --> 00:45:10,467
Yeah,
and I'm exhausted.

833
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,233
[laughing]
You mean the dog.

834
00:45:13,267 --> 00:45:15,400
Well, you guys
have a good night.
Okay, you, too.

835
00:45:15,433 --> 00:45:17,067
[Katherine]
Jake, come on, honey.

836
00:45:17,067 --> 00:45:18,833
[whining]
Oh, Jake!

837
00:45:18,867 --> 00:45:20,700
Looks like he doesn't
want to go in.

838
00:45:20,733 --> 00:45:23,333
I'm just going
for a little walk.
I'd be happy to take him.

839
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:25,467
That'd be great.
Thank you.
I could use the company.

840
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,967
Thank you, honey.
Of course. Bye.

841
00:45:29,833 --> 00:45:32,467
You're right.
You're right.

842
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,467
It's not that big a deal.
It's just a stupid
piece of plastic.

843
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,533
It's just that it
means so much to him,

844
00:45:38,567 --> 00:45:42,833
and he wants to give it to her,
and she doesn't even care!

845
00:45:42,867 --> 00:45:44,667
Do you understand?

846
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,700
That's the kind of stuff you
have to take into consideration

847
00:45:46,733 --> 00:45:48,300
when proposing
to someone, right?

848
00:45:49,767 --> 00:45:51,733
Maybe I'm being a little...

849
00:45:51,767 --> 00:45:53,867
Oh, God. I must be
out of my mind.

850
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:56,867
I'm telling a dog I'm still
in love with my ex-boyfriend--
[gasps]

851
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,367
[Jake whines]
Oh, my God.

852
00:46:00,733 --> 00:46:02,667
I'm still in love
with David.

853
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,767
I gotta tell him.

854
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,767
[barks]

855
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,100
I gotta tell him.

856
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:09,867
[barks]
I'm going to tell him.

857
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,767
I'm going to tell him.
Unless you don't think I should.

858
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,233
Okay. Now I've lost it.

859
00:46:35,733 --> 00:46:37,933
Well, it's nice
to see you, too.

860
00:46:37,967 --> 00:46:39,467
[nervous chuckle]
Why are you here?

861
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,600
I was wondering if we can
come in for a minute.

862
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,067
There's something
I have to talk to you about.
"We"?

863
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,433
Did you adopt him?
He's with you more than
he's with your neighbors.

864
00:46:52,467 --> 00:46:55,433
Oh, no. [laughs]
You're cute.

865
00:46:55,467 --> 00:46:57,167
Uh, funny. Funny.

866
00:46:58,567 --> 00:47:00,333
Can we talk
some other time?

867
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:02,600
Kelly's on her way over.
Oh, well,

868
00:47:02,633 --> 00:47:05,800
actually, that's kind of what
I want to talk to you about.

869
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:09,267
David, um-- Wow.

870
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,067
You, uh, you
classed this place up.

871
00:47:12,067 --> 00:47:14,933
Is that a new couch
and coffee table?

872
00:47:14,967 --> 00:47:18,067
[chuckles]
It's new furniture, yeah.

873
00:47:18,067 --> 00:47:21,667
Wow. She, uh--

874
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,500
She really--

875
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,767
You two are really
in love, aren't you?

876
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,433
Well, I wanted to give
my wife Aunt Pearl's ring.

877
00:47:32,467 --> 00:47:34,400
Hmm.
But...

878
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:48,633
Huh. She's, uh--

879
00:47:48,667 --> 00:47:50,600
She's gonna love it.

880
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:54,633
Should.
She picked it out.

881
00:47:54,667 --> 00:47:58,067
What?
She picked it out?

882
00:47:58,067 --> 00:48:02,200
Yeah, she's got this whole
wedding thing memorized.

883
00:48:02,233 --> 00:48:04,367
[chuckles]
Scripted, really.

884
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,733
Really.
It's actually
kind of cute.

885
00:48:08,133 --> 00:48:09,700
She's really excited.

886
00:48:12,133 --> 00:48:13,900
You're really
doing this, aren't you?

887
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:16,667
Yeah. And I'd like
to make it official tonight,

888
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:19,533
unless you have plans
on screwing it up again.

889
00:48:19,567 --> 00:48:22,700
[laughing]
Yeah, well...
Listen, Lis,

890
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,333
she's coming over.

891
00:48:24,367 --> 00:48:27,067
You have to go.
What are you
even doing here?

892
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:34,100
Well, um...
Myra found Mario.

893
00:48:34,133 --> 00:48:36,733
Mario. The puppy. Right.
The puppy.
My puppy. Yeah.

894
00:48:36,767 --> 00:48:38,600
[clattering]
Oh, Jake, no.

895
00:48:38,633 --> 00:48:41,200
No, no, no.
Get down. Oh. Oh.

896
00:48:41,233 --> 00:48:43,267
It's okay.
It's, uh, it's, uh--

897
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,267
Oh, God, it's, um--

898
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,367
I, uh--

899
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,933
I think he knocked it
down the sink.

900
00:48:49,967 --> 00:48:51,700
[David]
I can't believe this!

901
00:48:51,733 --> 00:48:53,833
I'm sorry.
You know what?

902
00:48:53,867 --> 00:48:56,667
Call a plumber.
Propose in the morning.

903
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,333
What is it with you
and these dogs?
I don't know!

904
00:48:59,367 --> 00:49:01,400
Maybe they're--
Oh, we're--

905
00:49:01,433 --> 00:49:04,600
I'm trying to
tell you something.

906
00:49:04,633 --> 00:49:07,567
What does that mean?
I...

907
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,633
[Kelly singing]  
 * Ring ring ring 
 Answer the phone *

908
00:49:09,667 --> 00:49:12,267
* Ring ring ring ring 
 Answer the phone *

909
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,800
That's... her.
 * Ring ring, why haven't you 
 answered the phone by now *

910
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:17,267
Hi. [chuckles]

911
00:49:19,633 --> 00:49:23,267
Oh, no. Yeah,
that's-that's fine.

912
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,067
[chuckling]
Yeah.
[whining]

913
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,067
You're the best.
I love you.

914
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,433
No, I--

915
00:49:33,533 --> 00:49:37,067
I love you, too,
snookums. Okay.

916
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,400
All right. Bye.

917
00:49:41,767 --> 00:49:44,967
She's running late.
Ah. You see?

918
00:49:45,067 --> 00:49:46,600
Everything worked out.

919
00:49:49,467 --> 00:49:51,267
Again with the look.
Lis...

920
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:52,800
I'm sorry. Uh--

921
00:49:54,167 --> 00:49:55,500
I'm going.

922
00:49:55,533 --> 00:49:57,633
Can you take your--
Thank you.
Yes.

923
00:49:57,667 --> 00:50:00,233
Okay.

924
00:50:00,267 --> 00:50:03,033
Jake. Come on! Sorry.
Mm-hmm.

925
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:10,800
How does he even...

926
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:13,133
Well, that didn't go
as I expected.

927
00:50:13,167 --> 00:50:17,700
But what did I expect?
He loves her, not me anymore.

928
00:50:20,167 --> 00:50:22,933
It looks delicious.
[chuckles]
Thank you.

929
00:50:22,967 --> 00:50:25,000
Do you want
some more wine?
Sure.

930
00:50:25,033 --> 00:50:26,667
Okay.

931
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,500
[Michael]
Aw, come on! Ah!
Jiminy Christmas!

932
00:50:29,533 --> 00:50:31,400
[Michael muttering]

933
00:50:31,433 --> 00:50:32,767
[both laugh]

934
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,133
Come on, you!
Son of a Blitzen! Ow!

935
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:39,100
I'm--

936
00:50:39,133 --> 00:50:41,967
Could you
give me a second?
I'm gonna just--

937
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
'Cause he--
I'll be right back.
Righty tighty. [grunts]

938
00:50:47,033 --> 00:50:50,700
Lefty loosey.
Lefty-- [grunting]
Quick little..

939
00:50:53,433 --> 00:50:55,567
Hey. Hey!
Aah! Ah!

940
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,167
Hey!
Ouch! What?

941
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,700
You said this would
take 15 minutes.
That was over an hour ago.

942
00:51:00,733 --> 00:51:02,567
Yeah, well, now
it's personal, okay?

943
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,400
I'm kind of in
the middle of something.

944
00:51:05,433 --> 00:51:06,900
Yeah, she's cute.

945
00:51:06,933 --> 00:51:10,633
Look. If I had known
it was gonna take this long,

946
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:12,700
I would have said
let's do it another time.

947
00:51:12,733 --> 00:51:15,567
I have managed
this building for 26 years.

948
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,467
I know the pipes.
All right?

949
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,833
Could we call it a night?
I can get a real plumber
here tomorrow.

950
00:51:20,867 --> 00:51:22,867
A real plumber
will charge me 500 bucks.

951
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:26,467
A real plumber
might find my ring.
Yeah, but I'm this close!

952
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,367
Come on!

953
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,067
[grunting] Come on.
For heaven's sake.

954
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,067
Just--
[grunting]

955
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,800
Aah!

956
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:45,367
[sighing,
breathing heavily]

957
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,433
[grunts, spits]

958
00:51:48,767 --> 00:51:50,067
Voilà!

959
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,533
[chuckles]

960
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,600
[laughing]

961
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,267
Hey...
[grunting]

962
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,600
What's the matter?
You look like

963
00:52:03,633 --> 00:52:05,800
you want me to put the ring
back in the sink, yeah?

964
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:07,933
What?
Well...

965
00:52:07,967 --> 00:52:10,067
you're gonna pop
the question, aren't you?

966
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:13,433
So... what's the matter?
You can't decide?

967
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,800
[Lisa, David laughing] 
 [David] 
 That's right.

968
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:25,733
[David &amp; Lisa] 
 The Big Swampland 
 Outdoor Music Fest.

969
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:41,433
Hey, let me
ask you something.

970
00:52:41,467 --> 00:52:43,967
Yeah-- Wh-Whoa.

971
00:52:44,067 --> 00:52:46,700
Uh, David--
[chuckles]

972
00:52:46,733 --> 00:52:49,967
Look, you've been
in the building
for a long time,

973
00:52:50,067 --> 00:52:53,900
but, uh...
you're not gonna ask me
to marry you, are you?

974
00:52:53,933 --> 00:52:55,600
What? No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

975
00:52:55,633 --> 00:52:56,800
No, no, look.
Oh, good.

976
00:52:56,833 --> 00:52:58,733
It's a survey I'm taking.

977
00:52:58,767 --> 00:53:01,067
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I-I don't follow.

978
00:53:01,067 --> 00:53:01,967
Are you married?

979
00:53:01,967 --> 00:53:03,667
No!
It's that bad?

980
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,267
Oh... it's worse.

981
00:53:10,067 --> 00:53:12,333
Whoo! Smokin'!

982
00:53:12,367 --> 00:53:16,300
I understand
why she's confusing
the...out of you

983
00:53:16,333 --> 00:53:18,300
just by looking at her.
[giggles]

984
00:53:25,167 --> 00:53:28,333
Say, how did your ring
wind up in the sink, anyway?

985
00:53:28,367 --> 00:53:30,767
My ex-girlfriend's
neighbor's dog

986
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,300
knocked it down there.

987
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:34,267
Oh, wow.

988
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,767
You are really in
over your head, aren't you?

989
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,467
Well, marriage is forever.

990
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,967
[laughing]
Ho ho ho ho ho!

991
00:53:41,067 --> 00:53:43,467
Oh, ho ho ho ho ho!

992
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,300
Terrific.
[laughing]

993
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:48,167
"Marriage is forever."
Yeah, ho ho ho!

994
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,133
Yeah, well, you tell that
to my last two wives.

995
00:53:51,167 --> 00:53:54,067
[laughing]
Good luck.

996
00:53:57,067 --> 00:54:01,167
[door opening,
closing]

997
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,833
I hate that fat man.

998
00:54:04,633 --> 00:54:06,200
I still
don't understand.

999
00:54:06,233 --> 00:54:07,867
What's to understand?

1000
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:11,533
It's just confusing.
Does she love him or not?

1001
00:54:11,567 --> 00:54:13,533
Well, she's known him
for, like, forever.

1002
00:54:13,567 --> 00:54:15,333
So, yes?

1003
00:54:15,367 --> 00:54:17,567
She loves him, but she
doesn't love him that way.

1004
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,867
He's just like a friend.

1005
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,767
Oh.

1006
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,333
Do you get it?
Yeah. I think so.

1007
00:54:27,433 --> 00:54:29,067
No, not really.

1008
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:33,233
She just doesn't
think of him that way.

1009
00:54:33,267 --> 00:54:35,367
They're too good
of friends.

1010
00:54:36,633 --> 00:54:38,367
Kind of like us.

1011
00:54:39,867 --> 00:54:41,533
Oh.

1012
00:54:41,567 --> 00:54:43,700
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1013
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,567
Think so.

1014
00:54:49,533 --> 00:54:51,533
Do you?

1015
00:54:51,567 --> 00:54:53,700
Oh.

1016
00:54:57,067 --> 00:54:58,367
Oh.

1017
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,100
I'm sorry, Freddie. It--

1018
00:55:00,133 --> 00:55:03,833
No, no, no.
It's cool. It's cool.

1019
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,467
Are you sure?

1020
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,267
Yeah.

1021
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:10,800
Yeah, yeah, I'm--
I'm-I'm-I'm fine.

1022
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:13,467
I-I-I gotta go
do something.

1023
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,933
Freddie, are you okay?

1024
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:18,733
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

1025
00:55:18,767 --> 00:55:20,567
I'll talk
to you later, okay?

1026
00:55:30,667 --> 00:55:32,500
Nice move.
Six-four.

1027
00:55:32,533 --> 00:55:33,900
Six-four?

1028
00:55:33,933 --> 00:55:35,167
Six-four moi.

1029
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,867
[sighs]

1030
00:55:40,767 --> 00:55:42,367
Where'd you meet your wife?

1031
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,800
What?
Your wife.

1032
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:46,200
Oh, she was a year
behind me in law school.

1033
00:55:46,233 --> 00:55:49,500
She's a lawyer, too?
Yeah, well, she
practiced for a few years,

1034
00:55:49,533 --> 00:55:52,567
but then when we had kids,
she cut back.

1035
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,233
Only did
the occasional deposition.

1036
00:55:55,267 --> 00:55:58,200
Two girls, right?
Yeah, and...

1037
00:55:58,233 --> 00:56:01,133
[laughing]
Yeah, and two more points.

1038
00:56:01,167 --> 00:56:03,233
You're unreal. What type
of vitamins are you taking?

1039
00:56:03,267 --> 00:56:05,267
Sound mind, sound body.

1040
00:56:07,467 --> 00:56:10,800
[laughing]

1041
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:13,233
Whoo! Ten-four.

1042
00:56:13,267 --> 00:56:16,233
Well, I might add that you're
playing pretty crappy today.

1043
00:56:16,267 --> 00:56:18,400
You feeling all right?

1044
00:56:18,433 --> 00:56:21,367
Got a lot on my mind.
Like what?

1045
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:28,600
You sure about your wife?
When you proposed, I mean.

1046
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,067
Well, I was in college,

1047
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,300
having a good time,
was dating a lot.

1048
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:38,733
And then when
I met Katherine,
I knew for sure.

1049
00:56:38,767 --> 00:56:41,533
That she'd be your wife?
I knew it
was serious.

1050
00:56:41,567 --> 00:56:43,600
When I met her, I knew.

1051
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:46,933
And then, well, it took me
a couple of years to propose.

1052
00:56:46,967 --> 00:56:49,733
Couple years?
Yeah, like I said,

1053
00:56:49,767 --> 00:56:51,900
I was having
a good time in college.

1054
00:56:51,933 --> 00:56:53,567
When I finally did
propose to her,

1055
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,767
I... I was never more sure
of anything in my life.

1056
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,300
Haven't been
to this day.

1057
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,067
You know what?

1058
00:57:04,067 --> 00:57:06,067
She was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1059
00:57:08,867 --> 00:57:10,067
[crash]
Ah!

1060
00:57:10,067 --> 00:57:11,400
Oh!

1061
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,800
What are you
shaking your head about?

1062
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:21,667
You. Could have been
a lot worse, Ro--

1063
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:25,333
Ow. Sorry.
Basketball.

1064
00:57:25,367 --> 00:57:27,967
Why can't you play golf
like everyone else?

1065
00:57:28,067 --> 00:57:30,833
I told you how much
I hate golf. It bores
the...out of me.

1066
00:57:30,867 --> 00:57:33,067
Yeah, but it's safer.
What are you
going to do with that?

1067
00:57:33,067 --> 00:57:34,800
Put it under your knee.
Okay, go ahead.

1068
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:37,367
One, two, three. Ah!

1069
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:40,100
Thank God that doctor
had the sense to tell you

1070
00:57:40,133 --> 00:57:42,133
never to play
basketball again.

1071
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,167
I'm not gonna play
basketball again.

1072
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,533
Well, it's not like you were
going out for the NBA.

1073
00:57:47,567 --> 00:57:49,500
[sighing]

1074
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:53,467
Sweetheart.

1075
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,300
You okay?

1076
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:57,267
[muttering]
Just--

1077
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:01,700
It's this beach life,
you know?

1078
00:58:01,733 --> 00:58:05,833
All of this leisurely stuff,
I'm just not cut out for it.

1079
00:58:05,867 --> 00:58:08,333
It's just--
You mean, "retirement."

1080
00:58:08,367 --> 00:58:11,333
Well, yeah, I'm old,
but I'm not dead.

1081
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:13,567
I mean, I don't want
to be a judge again,

1082
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:19,400
but I could write a book
or teach or something.

1083
00:58:19,433 --> 00:58:25,067
All of this relaxing.
I can't stand being here.

1084
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:30,933
Rod, are-are you saying
what I think you're saying?

1085
00:58:30,967 --> 00:58:34,233
Look, honey, I know you
love it here and the beach,

1086
00:58:34,267 --> 00:58:36,767
and Jim and Patty
and the dogs--

1087
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,267
I hate it here!
What?

1088
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:40,700
I hate it here!

1089
00:58:40,733 --> 00:58:42,867
I thought you, with Jim
and Patty and the dogs--

1090
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:45,400
Jim and Patty
are driving me nuts.

1091
00:58:45,433 --> 00:58:49,067
They hate Jake. They go on
and on about the sun
all the time.

1092
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:52,333
It's gonna be Christmas
next week, and it's 90 degrees!

1093
00:58:52,367 --> 00:58:55,067
Well, it was 79
at home last year.

1094
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:58,567
Home. I miss our home.

1095
00:59:00,067 --> 00:59:02,633
And I miss our girls.

1096
00:59:02,667 --> 00:59:06,133
Why didn't you
say something?

1097
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:09,800
Because I thought
that you loved it here.
[laughing]

1098
00:59:09,833 --> 00:59:12,900
The beach
and the bikinis...
Yeah, and the basketball.

1099
00:59:12,933 --> 00:59:15,267
And I'll never play again.

1100
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:20,133
Well... we could get
exercise in other ways.

1101
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,067
Turn off the light.

1102
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,333
Now?
Mm-hmm.

1103
00:59:25,367 --> 00:59:28,467
You'll be the shepherdess,
I will be the hunter.

1104
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:31,467
[laughing]
[growling]

1105
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,833
Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Ooh! Sorry!

1106
00:59:47,867 --> 00:59:50,867
You know, you and Mom
are nothing alike.

1107
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,500
Thank you.

1108
00:59:52,533 --> 00:59:56,400
She had the tree up 
 before Thanksgiving.

1109
00:59:56,433 --> 00:59:59,533
You know, I love your mom,
and she loves me,

1110
00:59:59,567 --> 01:00:03,200
but we maintain that love
by agreeing to disagree.

1111
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:06,533
Oh, that actually
kind of rhymes.
[chuckling]

1112
01:00:06,567 --> 01:00:09,533
But come on.
You're right
most of the time.

1113
01:00:09,567 --> 01:00:12,500
I would like that
in writing.
Ha, ha, ha.

1114
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:17,200
What I mean is, you know,
the way you are with David.

1115
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:20,400
How am I with David?

1116
01:00:20,433 --> 01:00:22,500
You know, pitch-perfect.

1117
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,833
Wait. Right?

1118
01:00:25,867 --> 01:00:27,667
I don't even know
what you mean.
I guess...

1119
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,500
I've seen the way
you've been with him,

1120
01:00:29,533 --> 01:00:31,567
and I kind of know
you're upset.

1121
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,067
Upset? About what?
He's getting married.

1122
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,667
No, Myra, I'm very--

1123
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:39,967
Happy for him.
I know. I know you are.

1124
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,400
But, Aunt Lis, come on.

1125
01:00:42,433 --> 01:00:45,333
I think your mistake was
dating him in the first place.

1126
01:00:45,367 --> 01:00:47,500
That was my mistake?
Well, yeah.

1127
01:00:47,533 --> 01:00:50,833
If you never dated,
then you wouldn't be
so disappointed by it.

1128
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,133
That doesn't make
any sense, does it?
[knocking]

1129
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:57,133
Merry Christmas.

1130
01:00:57,167 --> 01:00:59,733
Well, hello.
Oh, that is so cute!

1131
01:00:59,767 --> 01:01:01,533
Did you make this?
Yeah.

1132
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:04,200
Well, Jake helped.
[laughs]

1133
01:01:04,233 --> 01:01:06,300
Huh.
He's pretty handy
in the kitchen.

1134
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:08,233
Ha, ha.
There you are.

1135
01:01:08,267 --> 01:01:09,967
Come in, come in.
We're just trimming the tree.

1136
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:11,900
Can I get you anything?
Oh, no, I can't stay.

1137
01:01:11,933 --> 01:01:13,733
I've got to deliver
a few more of those.

1138
01:01:13,767 --> 01:01:16,567
I just wanted to invite
you both to a little--

1139
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,800
and your mom,
if she can--

1140
01:01:18,833 --> 01:01:22,400
Christmas, uh, goodbye party
we're throwing Saturday.

1141
01:01:22,433 --> 01:01:25,400
Wait a minute.
Goodbye party?

1142
01:01:25,433 --> 01:01:28,067
Yeah, Rod and I--

1143
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:32,600
Well, it just turns out
that retirement didn't
really take with Rod.

1144
01:01:32,633 --> 01:01:34,900
And I really miss
my girls.

1145
01:01:34,933 --> 01:01:38,833
Yeah, I'm gonna miss
you little guys, too. You.

1146
01:01:41,233 --> 01:01:43,433
And, uh,

1147
01:01:43,467 --> 01:01:45,967
I'm really gonna
miss you, sweetheart.

1148
01:01:46,067 --> 01:01:48,100
I'm really gonna
miss you, Katherine.

1149
01:01:48,133 --> 01:01:51,200
So, come give us
a proper send-off.

1150
01:01:52,467 --> 01:01:55,400
Rod invited David.

1151
01:01:55,433 --> 01:01:59,067
And, also, if you wanna
invite Freddie, Myra,
that'd be fine.

1152
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,833
Oh, uh, we broke up.

1153
01:02:01,867 --> 01:02:03,867
You what?

1154
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,367
I'm sorry to hear that.

1155
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,567
I hope you're
still friends.

1156
01:02:12,733 --> 01:02:15,200
So, anyway,
hope you both come.

1157
01:02:15,233 --> 01:02:17,100
Yes.

1158
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:18,433
Thank you.

1159
01:02:18,467 --> 01:02:21,100
Come on. Jake.
[whistles, kissing sounds]

1160
01:02:21,133 --> 01:02:22,467
Come on. Good boy.

1161
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:32,667
You broke up with Freddie?
You guys were together
for, what, like a week.

1162
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,433
Oh. I forgot how silly
puppy love can be.

1163
01:02:35,467 --> 01:02:39,433
Exactly. That's what
I've been trying to say.

1164
01:02:39,467 --> 01:02:42,567
I figure, cut it off now
and save myself the heartache.

1165
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,333
Oh, you like him.

1166
01:02:46,367 --> 01:02:49,933
What? No.
He's just a friend.

1167
01:02:49,967 --> 01:02:53,433
Hmm, "just a friend."
You like-him like him.

1168
01:02:53,467 --> 01:02:55,467
It's not like that.
Myra.

1169
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,433
Okay, fine, fine, I like him.
I like him a lot, okay.

1170
01:02:58,467 --> 01:03:01,333
Just... I'm afraid.

1171
01:03:02,767 --> 01:03:05,233
I don't wanna get hurt
like you did.

1172
01:03:05,267 --> 01:03:08,367
I see how much you love David,
and he's marrying someone else.

1173
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,367
You've been in love with him
for like your whole life.

1174
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,567
Why won't you
say anything?

1175
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,067
This might be hard
for you to understand,

1176
01:03:16,067 --> 01:03:20,200
but David deserves
all the happiness in the world.

1177
01:03:20,233 --> 01:03:22,200
Even if it's not with me.

1178
01:03:22,233 --> 01:03:24,100
But aren't you
completely miserable?

1179
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:27,667
Yeah, I know, it sucks,
it hurts, but...

1180
01:03:29,367 --> 01:03:33,200
my mistake wasn't dating him
in the first place.

1181
01:03:33,233 --> 01:03:36,500
My mistake was being so afraid
to lose him that I let him go.

1182
01:03:38,733 --> 01:03:40,700
Wow, major intimacy
issues, Aunt Lis.

1183
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:42,767
Okay.

1184
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:48,733
I guess I'm not
as pitch-perfect as you thought.
Apparently not.

1185
01:03:48,767 --> 01:03:50,600
Hey.

1186
01:03:50,633 --> 01:03:52,467
It's too late for me.

1187
01:03:53,933 --> 01:03:58,800
But I don't think
Freddie's engaged yet.

1188
01:04:02,667 --> 01:04:09,167
* Should auld acquaintance 
 be forgot *

1189
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:15,400
* And never brought to mind

1190
01:04:15,433 --> 01:04:21,667
* Should auld acquaintance 
 be forgot *

1191
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:27,300
* And auld lang syne

1192
01:04:27,333 --> 01:04:34,100
For auld lang syne, my dear *

1193
01:04:34,133 --> 01:04:39,800
* For auld lang syne  
[laughing]

1194
01:04:39,833 --> 01:04:47,433
[yammering]
 * We'll take a cup 
 of kindness yet *

1195
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:54,933
* For auld lang syne

1196
01:04:54,967 --> 01:05:01,167
* For auld lang syne

1197
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,200
Now, try not to knock
the tree o--

1198
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,200
Sweet dreams.

1199
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,867
See you.

1200
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:29,333
Hi. Hi.

1201
01:05:30,567 --> 01:05:32,367
Hey, Mom.
Hi, honey.

1202
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,333
Merry Christmas.

1203
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:39,700
Hey. Hey.
Oh, hey.

1204
01:05:39,733 --> 01:05:41,633
How are ya?
Good. Merry Christmas.

1205
01:05:41,667 --> 01:05:43,800
Merry Christmas
to you, too.
How are you feeling?

1206
01:05:43,833 --> 01:05:46,133
Oh, it's not
as bad as it looks.

1207
01:05:46,167 --> 01:05:47,533
Wow, cane.

1208
01:05:47,567 --> 01:05:49,233
Yeah. One more word about it,

1209
01:05:49,267 --> 01:05:50,233
I'll kick your...

1210
01:05:50,267 --> 01:05:52,300
[laughing]
[laughing]

1211
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:54,467
Rod, Katherine,
this is Kelly, my fiancée.

1212
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:56,067
How do you do?
Fine, thanks.

1213
01:05:56,067 --> 01:05:57,300
I've heard
so much about you.

1214
01:05:57,333 --> 01:05:58,867
Really? Aw.

1215
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,900
I haven't heard
anything about you.

1216
01:06:00,933 --> 01:06:02,400
[laughs]
That's good.

1217
01:06:02,433 --> 01:06:05,700
No, Rod is the guy
that I play basketball with.

1218
01:06:05,733 --> 01:06:08,433
The old guy?
The-- Yes!

1219
01:06:08,467 --> 01:06:11,067
Hello! You've got
great hair.
Yeah, the old guy.

1220
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:13,533
Thank you, thank you.
Would you like a drink?

1221
01:06:13,567 --> 01:06:16,067
Why not?
Follow me.

1222
01:06:27,933 --> 01:06:28,867
Hi.

1223
01:06:34,333 --> 01:06:36,533
Uh, hey!

1224
01:06:36,567 --> 01:06:38,400
I got you
something, yeah.

1225
01:06:38,433 --> 01:06:43,300
Uh, thanks,
but I didn't get you--
No, it's okay.

1226
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:45,100
I don't deserve it.

1227
01:06:45,133 --> 01:06:46,933
That's not true.

1228
01:06:46,967 --> 01:06:48,100
Just open it.

1229
01:06:48,133 --> 01:06:50,433
Like right now?

1230
01:06:50,467 --> 01:06:52,067
[chuckles]
Yeah, now.

1231
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:03,733
Thank you.

1232
01:07:05,533 --> 01:07:08,267
Freddie, you're
such a sweetheart.

1233
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,533
I am?

1234
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:11,167
And I'm such a jerk.

1235
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,967
No, no, you're not.

1236
01:07:13,067 --> 01:07:16,067
I mean, yeah, yeah,
maybe a little, but...

1237
01:07:16,067 --> 01:07:17,267
I'm just kidding.

1238
01:07:18,733 --> 01:07:20,633
Do you wanna go
for a walk?

1239
01:07:20,667 --> 01:07:22,467
Listen to all
these old people.

1240
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:23,767
Sure.

1241
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:27,833
Hey.

1242
01:07:29,133 --> 01:07:30,933
[Kelly]
That's Jenny and Mike.

1243
01:07:30,967 --> 01:07:33,433
They started dating
in junior high school.

1244
01:07:33,467 --> 01:07:35,433
Chrissy and Nate,
that was high school.

1245
01:07:35,467 --> 01:07:38,867
Ah.
But Julia has a place
in the Hamptons.

1246
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:41,067
She's the one,
and you know what they say.

1247
01:07:41,067 --> 01:07:43,767
Anybody who's worth anything
has a place there.

1248
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,667
Well, I--
That's-That's not true.

1249
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,800
I don't have
a place up there.
[laughing]

1250
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:51,067
Anyway, we don't wanna go
all the way up there.

1251
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:54,800
So we're just gonna
do it here, and that's cool,

1252
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:56,800
because all my girlfriends
are here anyway.

1253
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:59,600
Right, and that'll
make it easier to plan
and coordinate.

1254
01:07:59,633 --> 01:08:01,733
Yes! Exactly.

1255
01:08:01,767 --> 01:08:04,167
And then as soon as I find
somebody on the inside,

1256
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:07,167
I mean,
we're pretty much set.

1257
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,767
"Inside"?

1258
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:12,167
I need someone with a connection
to the venue that we want.

1259
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,067
Hi.
Hey.

1260
01:08:14,067 --> 01:08:16,067
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

1261
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,167
How's everybody
doing tonight?
Great.

1262
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:21,933
Well, we are engaged!
Oh.

1263
01:08:21,967 --> 01:08:26,267
Wow. Congratulations.
That's quite a rock.

1264
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:29,367
That's what my girlfriend
Debbie said when she saw it.

1265
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:32,433
It was so sweet
because she got
so jealous.

1266
01:08:32,467 --> 01:08:35,067
She's gonna be
my maid of honor.
That's great.

1267
01:08:35,067 --> 01:08:37,067
Have you guys
set a date?

1268
01:08:37,067 --> 01:08:40,067
Well, as soon as...

1269
01:08:40,067 --> 01:08:42,067
Possible.
possible, really.

1270
01:08:42,067 --> 01:08:45,667
The only hiccup is that,
of course, we want
to have it at The Plaza.

1271
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:49,067
But they said that
they are completely
booked for two years.

1272
01:08:49,067 --> 01:08:50,367
Wow.
Oh.

1273
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,433
I know.
Really.

1274
01:08:52,467 --> 01:08:55,433
Yeah.
Completely booked?

1275
01:08:55,467 --> 01:08:59,267
Well, I'm not making that up.
That's what they said.

1276
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,800
[Lisa]
That's just weird.

1277
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:03,600
But it's just really sad
more than anything.

1278
01:09:03,633 --> 01:09:05,600
I was just writing
in my journal

1279
01:09:05,633 --> 01:09:07,767
that if I don't get
married in that place,

1280
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,633
I would feel like
a bit of my heart died.

1281
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:14,800
Whoa. Someone is
pretty excited.

1282
01:09:14,833 --> 01:09:16,233
[nervous chuckle]

1283
01:09:16,267 --> 01:09:18,733
Well, but anyway,
speaking of dying...

1284
01:09:21,933 --> 01:09:24,067
I just meant--
I was gonna say that I--

1285
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:25,967
my throat
is dying of thirst.

1286
01:09:26,067 --> 01:09:27,433
I didn't mean--
I'm sorry.

1287
01:09:27,467 --> 01:09:29,267
Mm, no, no.
No.

1288
01:09:30,367 --> 01:09:32,467
Why don't-- I'll--

1289
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,433
Yeah, I'll be
right back.

1290
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:49,967
[Kelly]
Now, where are
you guys from?

1291
01:09:50,067 --> 01:09:51,267
Oh!
[screaming]

1292
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:52,800
Sorry. No!
Oh, Jake!

1293
01:09:52,833 --> 01:09:55,067
This is silk.
I'm sorry. No.

1294
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,800
The dog bumped me.

1295
01:09:56,833 --> 01:09:58,067
It was an accident.

1296
01:09:58,067 --> 01:09:59,167
Jake bumped me.
It's ruined.

1297
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:01,667
Who is Jake?
It's their dog.

1298
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:03,067
It was an accident.

1299
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:04,933
I think I could
get that out.

1300
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:07,533
Come with me.
It's all right.
We'll be good.

1301
01:10:21,433 --> 01:10:23,367
I'm gonna get some air.

1302
01:10:59,533 --> 01:11:01,767
Hey.
Hey.

1303
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:06,300
Sorry. She gets
a little...

1304
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:08,533
worked up sometimes.

1305
01:11:08,567 --> 01:11:12,567
Yeah. Yeah, well,
you know, the holidays
make everyone crazy.

1306
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,367
When you throw in a wedding,
it's downright insane, huh?

1307
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,733
[chuckles]
Seems like it, yeah.

1308
01:11:17,767 --> 01:11:19,367
[sighing]

1309
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:22,300
So, um...

1310
01:11:25,267 --> 01:11:26,833
congratulations.

1311
01:11:28,567 --> 01:11:30,067
Really.

1312
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,167
I'm really happy you
finally found somebody.

1313
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,967
Thanks.

1314
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,200
Don't worry. You'll find
someone, too, Lis.

1315
01:11:41,233 --> 01:11:43,167
You're, um...

1316
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,767
one of kind.

1317
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:48,700
Thanks.

1318
01:11:51,733 --> 01:11:53,100
Um... [clears throat]

1319
01:11:56,333 --> 01:12:00,067
Where did you find it?
It was around Mario's neck.

1320
01:12:00,067 --> 01:12:01,767
[laughing]
What?
Yeah.

1321
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,400
When I came by your house
last week,

1322
01:12:03,433 --> 01:12:05,533
I was gonna give it
to you then, and--

1323
01:12:05,567 --> 01:12:09,133
You already had the other ring,
and Kelly seems to really like
the other one.

1324
01:12:09,167 --> 01:12:11,567
I can't argue with you there.
I can't believe you found it.

1325
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,967
Yeah.

1326
01:12:14,067 --> 01:12:15,933
Well, I'm sorry
I kept it.

1327
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:22,500
Now you can give it to
the woman you're gonna spend
the rest of your life with.

1328
01:12:23,933 --> 01:12:26,067
Just like
you always wanted.

1329
01:12:29,433 --> 01:12:31,367
You know,

1330
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,333
I always thought
that, um...

1331
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,400
[Kelly clears throat]
David.

1332
01:12:36,433 --> 01:12:38,867
Oh, there you are.

1333
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:41,767
Ooh.
[chuckling]

1334
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:44,433
Are you ready to go? Michelle
and Eric's party started.

1335
01:12:44,467 --> 01:12:46,533
Michelle and Eric's party.
That's Kelly's friends.

1336
01:12:46,567 --> 01:12:49,300
That we're late for.
I'm sure I'll meet them
at the wedding.

1337
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:50,600
Thanks.

1338
01:12:50,633 --> 01:12:52,333
Of course.

1339
01:12:53,733 --> 01:12:55,800
Congratulations.
And Merry Christmas.

1340
01:12:55,833 --> 01:12:57,867
Merry Christmas.

1341
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,200
Merry Christmas.

1342
01:13:09,267 --> 01:13:11,633
Thanks so much for
helping me clean up, Lis.

1343
01:13:11,667 --> 01:13:15,400
Yeah, of course.
Rod couldn't do it
with that bad knee.

1344
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:17,633
[chuckles]
With or without that knee,

1345
01:13:17,667 --> 01:13:21,300
I think it might have
been the seven drinks
that really did him in.

1346
01:13:23,533 --> 01:13:26,733
You okay?
Yeah.

1347
01:13:26,767 --> 01:13:30,067
Yeah.
Why wouldn't I be okay?

1348
01:13:30,067 --> 01:13:33,867
Oh, oh, you mean because
my first and only love
is marrying someone else

1349
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:38,900
and irrevocably ruining my life
by wrecking the best friendship
I ever had

1350
01:13:38,933 --> 01:13:40,700
because I was afraid?

1351
01:13:40,733 --> 01:13:42,500
Yeah, you know,
I'm actually surprised

1352
01:13:42,533 --> 01:13:44,967
you're letting me help you
clean up your living room

1353
01:13:45,067 --> 01:13:48,167
and you're not worried
that I'm actually burning down
your lovely home to the ground.

1354
01:13:49,533 --> 01:13:52,333
Yeah, uh, good point.

1355
01:14:00,133 --> 01:14:01,900
I screwed up.

1356
01:14:03,433 --> 01:14:06,600
You certainly did.
Thanks.

1357
01:14:06,633 --> 01:14:09,200
What do you want me
to say, sweetheart?

1358
01:14:09,233 --> 01:14:11,933
Seeing David
engaged to that girl
is breaking my heart.

1359
01:14:11,967 --> 01:14:14,800
I was never
in love with him.

1360
01:14:14,833 --> 01:14:16,767
Are you trying
to make me feel better?

1361
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,067
Because you're doing
a terrible job at it.

1362
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:22,300
You just said
that you were afraid.

1363
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:25,267
What exactly
are you afraid of?

1364
01:14:27,167 --> 01:14:29,433
[sighing]
He was...

1365
01:14:30,733 --> 01:14:32,367
He was so good.

1366
01:14:33,833 --> 01:14:37,067
But he wasn't perfect.
But who is?

1367
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:41,900
Oh, but he was pretty good.

1368
01:14:41,933 --> 01:14:45,933
It's just that every time
he veered from "amazing,"

1369
01:14:47,833 --> 01:14:50,300
I got scared.

1370
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:55,067
"Oh, he's going to hurt me.
Oh, he's going to leave me."

1371
01:14:56,900 --> 01:15:00,067
What I felt
was so strong...

1372
01:15:00,067 --> 01:15:02,433
that I figured that
if I cut it off now,

1373
01:15:04,067 --> 01:15:06,967
it wouldn't hurt
as bad later.

1374
01:15:07,067 --> 01:15:10,300
Yeah, I know, but you
kind of told me that already.

1375
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:12,533
Yes, but it
didn't work!

1376
01:15:12,567 --> 01:15:17,867
Don't you see? How could
I have been so stupid!

1377
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:22,367
I mean, look at me.
My life is like
this living room.

1378
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,467
The entire reason
that I broke up with him

1379
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:28,667
was so I would never feel
as terrible as I do right now.

1380
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,633
I...

1381
01:15:33,667 --> 01:15:37,733
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

1382
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,800
When Rod proposed to me...

1383
01:15:43,067 --> 01:15:44,933
you wanna know
what I said to him?

1384
01:15:46,067 --> 01:15:47,467
"Maybe."

1385
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:51,633
"Maybe"?
Yeah.

1386
01:15:51,667 --> 01:15:53,700
Probably the dumbest thing
I ever said,

1387
01:15:53,733 --> 01:15:56,300
but that's just
what came out of my mouth.

1388
01:15:56,333 --> 01:15:58,367
Maybe.

1389
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,867
Why?

1390
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:03,767
I was just out of law school
and working these crazy hours

1391
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:05,833
and had a lot on my mind.

1392
01:16:05,867 --> 01:16:09,667
But I loved him then.
I love him more even now.

1393
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:11,867
But I really loved him.

1394
01:16:15,067 --> 01:16:19,100
I guess...
maybe I was scared, too.

1395
01:16:19,133 --> 01:16:21,067
[sighs]

1396
01:16:21,067 --> 01:16:25,067
The poor guy
was so heartbroken

1397
01:16:25,067 --> 01:16:28,200
that I had to explain to him
and keep explaining,

1398
01:16:28,233 --> 01:16:31,900
"I didn't mean 'maybe,'
I meant 'yes.' Yes!"

1399
01:16:31,933 --> 01:16:34,600
A thousand times, yes, but--

1400
01:16:34,633 --> 01:16:39,067
[sniffles] Yes, yes,
a thousand times, yes.

1401
01:16:39,067 --> 01:16:42,700
Life's just confusing
sometimes, honey,

1402
01:16:42,733 --> 01:16:46,167
and, uh...
you make a mess.

1403
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:49,133
Yeah.

1404
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,667
But at least you
cleaned yours up.

1405
01:16:54,867 --> 01:16:57,467
You and Rod
wound up together.

1406
01:16:59,733 --> 01:17:03,067
I lost David.
[sighing]

1407
01:17:04,367 --> 01:17:06,833
Still, you know, the--

1408
01:17:06,867 --> 01:17:11,867
knowing that at least
one of us will be happy is...

1409
01:17:12,933 --> 01:17:14,367
it's okay.

1410
01:17:16,433 --> 01:17:18,967
And then...
[sighing]

1411
01:17:19,067 --> 01:17:22,400
looking at you and Rod
and seeing that...

1412
01:17:22,433 --> 01:17:26,633
it's actually possible
to love someone the rest
of your life, it...

1413
01:17:28,633 --> 01:17:30,733
it makes it easier,
I guess.

1414
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:36,767
David deserves to be
the... happiest person.

1415
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,200
You're a good soul, Lis.

1416
01:17:40,867 --> 01:17:43,133
You kind of screwed up
with David.

1417
01:17:43,167 --> 01:17:45,100
You did, but...

1418
01:17:45,133 --> 01:17:50,133
but that doesn't mean that
you can't clean up your life.

1419
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:53,367
And you find someone
who's gonna love you someday.

1420
01:17:54,933 --> 01:17:56,367
Okay?

1421
01:18:00,733 --> 01:18:04,600
[sniffling]

1422
01:18:34,067 --> 01:18:36,200
Gonna miss our games.
Don't you ever work?

1423
01:18:36,233 --> 01:18:38,867
Ah, it's quiet
during the holidays.
Yeah, well...

1424
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:41,800
So, you got
any job prospects
lined up back home?

1425
01:18:41,833 --> 01:18:44,467
Yes, as a matter of fact,
the local college

1426
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:47,200
has a spring
professorship open.

1427
01:18:47,233 --> 01:18:49,333
Congratulations,
Professor.

1428
01:18:49,367 --> 01:18:52,067
Well, that'll keep me
off the streets.
[laughing]

1429
01:18:52,067 --> 01:18:54,800
Glad I got that
sorted out.
Yeah.

1430
01:18:54,833 --> 01:18:57,867
How about you?
Your feet still chilly?

1431
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,767
What are you
talking about?
I proposed.

1432
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,900
Yeah, I know.

1433
01:19:02,933 --> 01:19:04,433
Everybody gets cold feet.

1434
01:19:04,467 --> 01:19:07,467
I saw that Kelly
was a little upset
the other night.

1435
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,633
She's nervous.
She's great.

1436
01:19:09,667 --> 01:19:13,067
I mean, she really is.
I mean, she's beautiful.

1437
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:17,067
She's smart and sweet
and she's funny.

1438
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,100
Yeah.
She's funny.

1439
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,067
She doesn't censor
herself sometimes.

1440
01:19:23,067 --> 01:19:26,400
Has a bit of a temper,
but who doesn't, right?
You don't have to sell me.

1441
01:19:26,433 --> 01:19:30,567
I'm not the one
that's gonna have to spend
the rest of my life with her.

1442
01:19:32,633 --> 01:19:36,667
David... if you don't
mind me saying something...

1443
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:44,367
You know,
when all the other stuff
melts away, and it will,

1444
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:47,367
and your knees aren't
what they used to be,

1445
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:50,567
and you're lying in bed
at the end of the night

1446
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,067
and you look over
next to you,

1447
01:19:53,067 --> 01:19:56,067
hopefully, if you're
lucky enough,

1448
01:19:57,067 --> 01:19:58,867
you see your best friend.

1449
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:03,200
Yeah.

1450
01:20:03,233 --> 01:20:03,267
[Rod]
Watch your back.
It's so...

1451
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,000
[Rod]
Watch your back.
It's so...

1452
01:20:06,033 --> 01:20:08,533
Oh, watch your knee.
All right. Thanks, babe.

1453
01:20:08,567 --> 01:20:13,167
Well, I'll be back
in a few weeks for
the rest of our stuff.

1454
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,167
You guys found a house
in a hurry, huh?

1455
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,200
Runs in
the family.

1456
01:20:17,233 --> 01:20:19,833
Yeah, well, we're gonna
stay with our daughter

1457
01:20:19,867 --> 01:20:22,667
until we find something
or she kicks us out.

1458
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:24,667
[Katherine laughs]

1459
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:28,100
Well, I'm really
gonna miss you both.

1460
01:20:28,133 --> 01:20:30,233
We're gonna
miss you, too.
Oh...

1461
01:20:30,267 --> 01:20:32,467
[kissing sounds]
[Katherine]
Sweet girl.

1462
01:20:34,067 --> 01:20:38,900
And you, I am gonna miss you
most of all, Scarecrow.

1463
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:45,900
Don't blame yourself.
You certainly gave
your best shot.

1464
01:20:47,433 --> 01:20:50,533
Thanks for trying.
[whining]

1465
01:20:50,567 --> 01:20:52,067
Mwah!

1466
01:20:56,767 --> 01:21:00,500
Bye, sweetheart.
You're gonna be okay.

1467
01:21:00,533 --> 01:21:03,133
Hmm. Thank you.

1468
01:21:03,167 --> 01:21:04,667
And Merry Christmas.

1469
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:07,300
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

1470
01:21:07,333 --> 01:21:09,433
Bye, Jake.
Be a good boy.

1471
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:21,067
[no audible dialogue]

1472
01:21:21,067 --> 01:21:22,400
David...

1473
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,700
I love you.
Me, too.

1474
01:21:36,467 --> 01:21:39,933
Oh. I can't believe it.
How did you do it?

1475
01:21:39,967 --> 01:21:41,967
I made a couple
of phone calls.

1476
01:21:42,067 --> 01:21:44,300
I know a lot of people
in event planning,

1477
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:46,800
and when you said this place
was booked indefinitely--

1478
01:21:46,833 --> 01:21:49,600
Why would they
say that to me?

1479
01:21:49,633 --> 01:21:53,900
It creates an air
of exclusivity, I guess.
Oh, yeah.

1480
01:21:53,933 --> 01:21:55,500
Seems to work.

1481
01:21:55,533 --> 01:21:58,300
Well, it is exactly
what I wanted.

1482
01:22:00,067 --> 01:22:03,533
I'm having emerald green
table linens.

1483
01:22:03,567 --> 01:22:06,467
The bridesmaids,
of course, will be
in emerald green as well,

1484
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,467
but you should see
my dress.

1485
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:10,567
You already have
a dress?

1486
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,533
Right here.

1487
01:22:13,667 --> 01:22:15,400
In my head.

1488
01:22:15,433 --> 01:22:18,833
Now, the band is gonna go here
with my parents here.

1489
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:21,367
Uh, Chrissy, Jenny,
and Michelle are gonna go here,

1490
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,667
but Aunt Dory I'm gonna
stick in the back.
What about David?

1491
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:25,467
David won't be here.

1492
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:27,867
Now, Dick and Marian
is a whole other--
What?

1493
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:29,833
[sighs]
We broke up.

1494
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:34,700
You what?

1495
01:22:34,733 --> 01:22:36,133
We broke up.

1496
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:39,467
A few days ago.

1497
01:22:40,767 --> 01:22:43,200
What-- Why?
What's going on?

1498
01:22:43,233 --> 01:22:45,867
He told me a long time ago
that the thought of marriage

1499
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:48,233
kind of freaked him out
when you pressed him.

1500
01:22:48,267 --> 01:22:50,900
Of course, he was a lot
more immature back then.

1501
01:22:50,933 --> 01:22:53,133
[chuckles]
So was I.

1502
01:22:54,267 --> 01:22:56,400
Still, I don't know,

1503
01:22:56,433 --> 01:22:59,167
I can't help but
think maybe he rushed
into things with me

1504
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:03,300
because I obviously have
no problem with the idea
of getting married at all.

1505
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:06,567
Yeah, but...
don't you love him?

1506
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:10,433
'Course I do.

1507
01:23:10,467 --> 01:23:12,433
Come on, he's wonderful.

1508
01:23:14,067 --> 01:23:16,067
But nothing would ruin
my perfect wedding

1509
01:23:16,067 --> 01:23:19,067
like marrying someone
who doesn't actually love me.

1510
01:23:22,467 --> 01:23:23,900
I'm sorry.

1511
01:23:26,067 --> 01:23:28,367
Don't be.

1512
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,267
Anyway, he was right.

1513
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:31,933
About what?

1514
01:23:34,067 --> 01:23:36,667
We should all marry
our best friend.

1515
01:23:38,667 --> 01:23:40,800
And someday
I'm gonna do that,

1516
01:23:40,833 --> 01:23:42,633
and you're gonna
help me book this room.

1517
01:23:42,667 --> 01:23:44,533
[chuckles]
Deal?

1518
01:23:44,567 --> 01:23:46,600
Deal.

1519
01:23:46,633 --> 01:23:48,933
I'm gonna give you
a hug now, I am.

1520
01:23:48,967 --> 01:23:51,067
Okay.

1521
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:53,067
So... all right?
Okay.

1522
01:24:32,567 --> 01:24:34,667
Well, I'm glad
you guys got in okay.

1523
01:24:36,867 --> 01:24:39,267
No, I haven't heard
from David.

1524
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:43,067
I'll let you know
if I do, yes.

1525
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:47,267
I gotta go.

1526
01:25:35,133 --> 01:25:36,667
Merry Christmas.

1527
01:25:39,533 --> 01:25:40,867
Merry Christmas.

1528
01:25:43,067 --> 01:25:47,200
Look... I just want
to say that I'm sorry.

1529
01:25:47,233 --> 01:25:51,067
I have some wine here.
For everything
that I said.

1530
01:25:51,067 --> 01:25:53,667
For being too scared...
French and Italian.

1531
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:56,900
and not telling you
how I really felt.
I also have some cheese, too.

1532
01:25:56,933 --> 01:25:58,500
I love you, David.

1533
01:26:03,667 --> 01:26:05,167
There's that look.

1534
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:07,467
"That look."
I don't know what--
No.

1535
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,967
No, it-- This is--

1536
01:26:11,067 --> 01:26:12,600
This is different.

1537
01:26:14,333 --> 01:26:16,500
It's...

1538
01:26:16,533 --> 01:26:19,233
It's just that I haven't
seen it in a long time.

1539
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:24,067
Lisa...
Hmm.

1540
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:25,733
I love you.

1541
01:26:27,333 --> 01:26:29,067
I have a question
for you.

1542
01:26:32,833 --> 01:26:34,733
Yes.
Will you...

1543
01:26:34,767 --> 01:26:36,367
I said yes.

1544
01:26:37,433 --> 01:26:38,967
Yes, yes.

1545
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,200
A thousand times, yes.
