1
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,050
16th Century Russia.

2
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,180
The Templar’s have sent me a great distance...

3
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,930
Father Baleminus.

4
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,170
Don't say... such name.

5
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,300
They know me here as... Bartholomew.

6
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,990
I'm the custodian of the gospel...
of the grandmaster Jacques De Molay.

7
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,170
Dear God...

8
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,210
The Gospel contains his secrets...

9
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,470
of the Order of the Templar’s.

10
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,330
No one except you, should know about it.

11
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:16,320
Before I die, I must give you the
responsibility, to take care of this gospel...

12
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,040
It is your ordained duty.

13
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:51,480
The Order of the Knights Templar’s, was
completely destroyed by Guillaume de Nogaret...

14
00:03:53,100 --> 00:04:00,120
Chancellor executioner and the right hand of the
King of France, however...

15
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,420
the immense treasure of the order was not destroyed...

16
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,350
it completely and utterly vanished.

17
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,070
Jacques De Molay, the grandmaster of the Order...

18
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,870
Was burned at the stake.

19
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:28,810
But before he died, he placed a curse, of sudden death and eternal damn nation...

20
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,560
of all those who were responsible for the destruction of the Order.

21
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,110
So Jacques De Molay's prophesy came true.

22
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,330
On April 20th, 1310, the Roman Pope...

23
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,490
Who was involved in the destruction,
of the Order... suddenly died.

24
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,640
A few days later Guillaume de Nogaret
himself... mysteriously died,

25
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,120
And on Nov. 29th... that very same year,

26
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,860
The king of France Philip IV...
also met his maker.

27
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:23,620
So was Jacques De Malay’s prophesy...
responsible for demise of this men?

28
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,870
That is up to you to decide.

29
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,880
Excuse me, professor...

30
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,470
I was very interested... in your lecture,

31
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,280
I always been fascinated by the 13th
and 14th century...

32
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,010
- Well thank you!
- I am Pierre Seminal.

33
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,400
Michael Nazzaro... I've read all your books.

34
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,100
In fact...

35
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,180
you're the main reason,
I got interested in Russian history.

36
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,410
- It's an honor to meet you Sir.
- You're American?
- Yea.

37
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,050
So, what brings you... to this part of the world?

38
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,050
I... ah...

39
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,710
mystery I guess, what I'm hoping to resolve in Russia.

40
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,430
Russia has a 1000 years... of mysteries.

41
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,870
Oh believe me... I know.

42
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,750
Are you familiar with Bartholomew?

43
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,850
- 16th century I believe, the time of Ivan the Terrible,
- Yea...

44
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,870
- I found... an ancient book, written by him.
- Really?

45
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:06,800
It contains some symbols in there... and...
that resemble those of the Knights Templar.

46
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,670
- I think it could be some kind of a code.
- A code?... Of what?

47
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,170
Well...

48
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,830
I think it might help me, find the missing
treasure of the Knights Templar.

49
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,260
A historian and an adventurer...
you must believe what you teach.

50
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,370
That I do.

51
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,370
So...

52
00:07:32,371 --> 00:07:37,350
what makes you think... that the
treasure is hidden here in... Russia?

53
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,660
Let's call it... instinct.

54
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,460
Well...

55
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:50,760
forgive me for asking but... how can
you afford this kind of research, on a...

56
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,850
professors salary?

57
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,050
I have a little hobby, that
makes a little extra cash.

58
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,360
- Watch where you're going!
- I'm so sorry.

59
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,950
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

60
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,950
I really am sorry.

61
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:56,320
- I told them to use their... imagination.
- Don't waste my time with your stupid ideas.

62
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,920
Now...

63
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,910
- what about transportation?
- I got something a little... special.

64
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,030
- Mike!
- Hey...

65
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,030
- I'm glad you could make it... ready to race?
- Yea man.

66
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,930
Come on.

67
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,100
That is a big man.

68
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,040
- Where is my money?
- Here
- That is my money.

69
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,940
Come on, I'll introduce you.

70
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,660
Wolf, I want to meet professor, from America.

71
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,290
- Welcome to Moscow professor.
- Thank you.

72
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,180
- I heard you're good.
- I try.

73
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,060
Do you know about the entry fee?

74
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,180
- 10,000.00 US... right?
- 10,000.00... but not to me, give it to him.

75
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,810
- That's a lot of money to lose.
- You sure you can afford it?

76
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,910
- I like you professor, nice to meet you, good luck.
- Thanks’...

77
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,020
- good to meet you too.
- Very good.

78
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,070
If he's as good as you say he is,
I have to take care of it...

79
00:10:59,609 --> 00:11:02,920
because we don't wanna chance it...
especially tonight.

80
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,700
- There's a dead man inside.
- I know.

81
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,100
- Why would you steal a corpse?
- Mmm... that I do not know.

82
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,250
Come on...

83
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,850
They're coming, everybody gets ready!

84
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,040
Everyone wait's for my Order!

85
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,590
I've located them... remember stop there.

86
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,440
I'm on my way, get ready to switch cars.

87
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,730
We are ready to roll!

88
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,190
Sir! We have a third party entering
the zone, at a high rate of speed.

89
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,710
- Can I get a description?
- No Sir, he was going too fast.

90
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,310
Just stay put, this guy has no idea,
what he's driving in to.

91
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,660
- Bo!
- Yea?

92
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,660
Put your guns away.

93
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,360
Serge... put your guns away.

94
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,180
- You got the money?
- You want to count it?

95
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,680
Certainly I can't trust you.

96
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,550
- What is that?
- I have no idea.

97
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,250
- This is ridiculous.
- Let us make these transaction.

98
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,420
Just put it on the ground.

99
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,210
Any time now!

100
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,580
What the hell happened?

101
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,190
I said... wait for my Order!

102
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,990
Now...

103
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,040
Now... arrest them all.

104
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,420
Nobody move and nobody gets hurt.

105
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,400
- You're a death man.
- We'll see... have a nice evening, gentlemen.

106
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,400
Yea...

107
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,960
I don't wanna hear any more excuses...

108
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:28,539
Hi boss...

109
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,290
How'd you know, the special forces
weren’t involved in this operation.

110
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,550
These weren’t the Spetsnaz... I just got of the
phone with them, these where imposters...

111
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,390
Well, no Sir... I think somebody (?)
them of, right in front of our eyes.

112
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,710
- You think? Don't talk... get away from me.
- Whatever.

113
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,220
- That was sweet...
- A piece of cake...

114
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,400
Now I've got a race win... get my
double to disappear, and that's it.

115
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,420
Where's he going?

116
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,230
That's impossible.

117
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,190
Beekeeper and Bo's.

118
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,000
I haven't seen you two for ages, you just
can't keep your nose's clean, can you?

119
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,590
- That's just... your personnel opinion.
- Why don't you tell me what happened here?

120
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,650
Well... just a Saturday night get
together, you know... boys will be boys.

121
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,830
The money and the drugs are gone.

122
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,530
- What?
- Vanished.

123
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,210
Did you get a description of the
person in the car?

124
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,270
They all said the same thing,
the guy was big... I mean huge.

125
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,570
Hold them for twelve hours, that's all we can do,
and then don't let them out of your side.

126
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,180
- All right, take'm away.
- Move out.

127
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,980
Wow...
Yea...

128
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,680
Let's go to my club, all of you, we'll celebrate.

129
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,640
This is a tough way, to lose 10.000 dollars.

130
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:47,270
- Yea, tell me about it.
- I just wanna say... you did good.

131
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,130
Don't get upset, nobody beats Wolf.

132
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,830
- Yea, but I just hate a...
- Losing?

133
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,720
Yea.

134
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,220
- I'm ah...
- Michael Nazarro.

135
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,920
- I'm Masha.
- Well, it's nice to meet you.

136
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:13,810
I'm sorry, I... knocked you down,
are you a student?

137
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,930
Yea... post graduate, I have a
masters in economics.

138
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,930
You don't say,

139
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,130
You know, you're pretty famous at the university.

140
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,830
Really... I didn't know my teaching
was that well known.

141
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,610
Um um, it's not your teaching.

142
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,010
- Hey, congratulations man.
- Professor, you were good.

143
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,130
Oh yea... but just not good enough.

144
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,880
Like a lot of racers, talk to talk,
and you my friend walk to walk.

145
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,970
- Let's get a drink, come on.
- Let's go

146
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:25,360
- Elisa... how is the night so far, baby?
- I'm not complaining, what would you like?

147
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,710
Nothing for me, thanks’.

148
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,210
You sure you don't want Vodka?
The best Russia has to offer.

149
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,810
It will make your bad days good,
and your good days even better.

150
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,490
No, I'm okay.

151
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,610
Wolf... what about you? You're usual?

152
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,630
Absolutely... my milk.

153
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,250
- How do you do that?
- Have you ever served in the army?

154
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,600
Yea, but they didn't teach me how to do that.

155
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,070
Well... if you just can imagine, that the can
is your sergeant, you can do it.

156
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,140
We're all going for a ride, you want to come with us?

157
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,450
- No, go ahead, I have things to do.
- Do you mind if I go?

158
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,600
- But be careful okay.
- Of course.

159
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,760
Elisa, take care of the professor,
I'll be back very soon.

160
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,510
- Professor?
- That's what I do, not what I am.

161
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,240
So, how long have you been...

162
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,650
Okay, you guys...

163
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:56,310
Ok, Igor, take one of this box, to each
of the 5 following addresses.

164
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,510
You did a great job guys...
you really looked like special forces.

165
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,370
- What should I do with the drugs?
- Dump it... in the river.

166
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,370
I knew you were gonna say that.

167
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,710
Oh, sorry man

168
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,790
- Hey, back of man.
- You never watch where you going.

169
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:22,119
Get your hands of...

170
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,870
Are you all right Professor?

171
00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:24,199
Yea.

172
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,060
You know... that's really one... intense wolf, Wolf.

173
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,750
Life is intense, my friend.

174
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,730
- Survival.
- Survival.

175
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,750
Oh, no, no, I had plenty.

176
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,280
You don't understand, Vodka is for the inside,

177
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,150
The bottle is for the outside,
take it put it against your eye.

178
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:12,319
You know...

179
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,010
that's a very interesting pendant.

180
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,520
Did you ever had it appraised?
To sell?

181
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,630
Out of the question,
this pendant brings me good luck.

182
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,630
I would never sell it, it's priceless.

183
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,290
Everything has its price.

184
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:43,670
In the next race, I put 50 Grant,
against your pendant.

185
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,710
50 Grant?

186
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,730
Do you really, have this kind of money?

187
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:57,970
I already took 10,000 dollars from you...
why do you want it so bad?

188
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,750
- I'm an archaeologist.
- And if I say no?

189
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:05,810
Then superstition, is taking the place of good sense.

190
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,390
Well good professor... okay...

191
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,990
If you win the next race...
the pendant is yours.

192
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:25,160
But if you lose, and you will,
you will owe me 50,000 dollars... cash.

193
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,990
Deal.

194
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:31,159
- We got a deal.
- Deal.

195
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,180
The operation against the Beekeeper
and his group failed.

196
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,400
- We didn't consider a third party.
- So who was... our uninvited guest?

197
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,800
Sir, we suspect that Serge,
known on the street as Wolf...

198
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,130
- Serge Wolf?
- Yes Sir, do you know him?

199
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,890
Yes, I knew his father Miguel Wolf...
he was a good friend.

200
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,150
He died of a drug overdose,
when Serge was in high-school.

201
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,590
This must be too good to be true,

202
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,540
At 15, Wolf was a member of a car jacking
gang, he left the gang later for sports...

203
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,650
A couple years later, he got in a huge
fight with a couple of drug dealers.

204
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,920
He was just a kid then, kids make mistakes,
so tell me something I don't know.

205
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:35,100
The FSB report states, he fought as a mercenary, spend time in the Balkan mountain.

206
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:41,500
At present he's the leader of a car-racing
gang, he also owns a nightclub.

207
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,920
So what! What does that all have
to do with a drug deal?

208
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:49,120
We think, the FM Beekeeper, was a bid to take
over the drug take here in Moscow.

209
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,970
And Wolf is the man behind the plan,
that's why we have one little problem.

210
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,140
- Which is what?
- Wolf has an alibi.

211
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:05,490
When Beekeeper's deal was going down, Wolf was
in a car race, witnessed by hundreds of spectators.

212
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,230
- How did he do?
- He won.

213
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,920
For centuries people have been fascinated
by the treasures of the Knights Templar.

214
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:31,700
Research has uncovered evidence, that 60
knights, abandon the Orders main temple,

215
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,890
And fled through port La Rochelle...
it is believed...

216
00:27:38,004 --> 00:27:44,970
That they placed the treasure on a ship
leaving France, for an unknown destination.

217
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,990
- Nazarro. - Yes Michael,
these is Pierre Saminault. - Hi.

218
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:09,710
- I was calling, to invite you to lunch.
- Yea, yea that be nice.

219
00:28:09,745 --> 00:28:13,270
Excellent... we could meet at the Amsterdam?

220
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,080
Yea, I know where it is... yea, let's say one o clock?

221
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,360
- I'll meet you then.
- Okay, see you then.

222
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,780
- Vodka for me please.
- Another one? - Sure.

223
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,430
- Thank you for meeting me.
- Oh, it's my pleasure.

224
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,340
Are you having any luck with your... quest?

225
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,380
Well, everything seems to point,
to the treasure being here in Moscow.

226
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Are you quiet sure, it's not just... urban legend?

227
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,030
Look...

228
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,430
If you look at the local monasteries...

229
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:09,980
the outer walls are covered with symbols, which are identical to the insignia of the Knights Templar.

230
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,730
- It doesn't prove anything.
- I don't know.

231
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,130
But... the grave-yards and graves of Russian warriors...

232
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:28,340
have exactly the same symbols,
now that tells me, these are the Knights...

233
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,900
who fled France, and came to Russia
to avoid execution.

234
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,290
Fancy meeting you in the library.

235
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,840
Oh... hi.

236
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,340
- Hi.
- Just... research, you know.

237
00:30:02,447 --> 00:30:05,590
Of course, it looks like you're busy,
I won’t keep you.

238
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:08,960
Oh, no no no, take a seat, I need a break anyway.

239
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:18,470
Rumor has it, you are searching for
the treasure of the Knights Templar.

240
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,800
- Who told you that?
- Like I said, you're famous on campus.

241
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,350
Well anyway, I like to introduce you,
to very interesting friend of mine.

242
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,470
He's the curator at the university museum,
you never know, he might be able to help you.

243
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,170
Do you really think, that I'm going to reveal
to you all the mysteries, I've been trying...

244
00:30:54,171 --> 00:30:56,670
to uncover, my entire life?

245
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:13,220
This is the biography of Bartholomew,
written by Bartholomew himself.

246
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,220
Is this sufficient to convince you, I'm serious?

247
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,270
- Can I see this book?
- Of course, go ahead.

248
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,870
Ohm...

249
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:35,570
It dates the book... at least 500 years old.

250
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,030
Where did you get it?.

251
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:41,480
It's has been passed down, from generation
to generation in my family.

252
00:31:41,481 --> 00:31:43,820
- Tell me...
- Yea.

253
00:31:43,821 --> 00:31:50,690
Have you... come across symbols such
as these, in these margins before?

254
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,990
Ah... only once.

255
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,260
Let's make a deal, you lend me the
biography for a week,

256
00:32:00,261 --> 00:32:05,070
And in return, I'll give you another
very interesting document.

257
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:09,230
I don’t know... I never left it with anyone before.

258
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,230
- I'll need to know, that it was...
- Safe?

259
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,740
It's what I do... look around.

260
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,030
You won't be disappointed.

261
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,270
This is the interrogation list of a French officer...

262
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,925
In...

263
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,725
1812.

264
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,760
He was interrogated by the Emperor
Alexander's special investigators.

265
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,310
The name of the arresting officer was... Nogaret.

266
00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:00,230
- The offspring of Nogaret, the persecutor of the Knights Templar.
- Exactly.

267
00:33:01,499 --> 00:33:04,650
- That's incredible.
- There you have it.

268
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:09,730
But the crucial fact is, on the interrogation
papers, the same symbols.

269
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,630
A... a rose, arrows, bows and arches.

270
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,800
So...

271
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,460
What about the exchange?

272
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,930
- Done.
- Ahh...

273
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:38,640
Today is the 18th, come back on the 23rd.

274
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,440
- For me it's hard.
- One more!

275
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,440
From now on.

276
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,990
- I dumped the cocaine in the Moscow river.
- And?...

277
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,750
Then I send the money to three separate clinic's.

278
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:04,830
How do they make the transaction?

279
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,730
The money is transmitted to the bank
accounts, through the anti drug foundation.

280
00:34:09,731 --> 00:34:16,920
If they try to check out the legal address, they will
come up with an elderly lady in Switzerland.

281
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,530
Nice.

282
00:34:18,531 --> 00:34:23,100
You know it's a shame, we never
get any credit for these.

283
00:34:23,101 --> 00:34:27,760
Remember Brian, it's not about the credit, not at all.

284
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,900
I told you I would find him, and I did.

285
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:42,870
I know he's the biggest man in Russia,
but it's hard to get to him.

286
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,080
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

287
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,840
The document is definitely real.

288
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,800
Maybe the symbols mean some kind of code.

289
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,980
But... how did Bartholomew know the
symbols of the Knights Templar?

290
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:26,570
Well, maybe he was one...
you see this here on these papers...

291
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:33,040
V.D.S.A. are the same letters,
that appear in Bartholomew’s book.

292
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,300
Hey, look here.

293
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:43,450
The translation says: Three feet east,
two feet down, and two stones from the left.

294
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,510
Three feet east of where?

295
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,880
- Dr. Ramirez.
- Michael.
- Welcome.

296
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,080
- Surprised to see me in Russia?
- Surprised... I'm delighted, my friend.

297
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:16,290
I'm here to report on the Colombian health care crises.

298
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,530
Wow... since when have you become infatuated?

299
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,130
Michael, my dear friend, before we
can study archaeology,

300
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,870
We have to save the civilization, that are still among us.

301
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,500
- Touché.
- My wife send you something.

302
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,500
Wow...

303
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,530
Very nice.

304
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:42,890
You look like Snoopy... but it fits.

305
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,490
In Russia we have some very
special drinking ceremonies.

306
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,830
Here we go... it's pretty hard to break a man,
that learned how to drink Tequila in the rainforest.

307
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,610
Well, it's very special to see you here in Moscow.

308
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,800
And these bottle, is a very special Vodka, my friend.

309
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,370
- Processed with milk.
- With milk?

310
00:37:09,565 --> 00:37:10,970
With milk.

311
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,010
- Wow...
- That is not bad.

312
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,950
- Isn't these the symbol of Acuities?
- Yea, you're good.

313
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:40,120
Well, I can't wait to see the Kremlin,
Red Square and Lenin's mausoleum.

314
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,920
And tell me, what cemetery is Lazar buried in?

315
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,290
Cemetery... Ramirez you are a genius.

316
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,500
Cemetery?... I'm a genius?

317
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,770
We're making great progress, young man.

318
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:18,719
Actually, hmm... I was close to the truth myself,
but I wasn't able to decode the symbols...

319
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:25,120
of the Frenchmen's interrogation papers,
because I didn't have your book.

320
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:31,960
I made a copy of it, and I'm giving you back
your rare-ity.

321
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,420
- And I yours.
- Thank you, very much.

322
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,930
I've searched ah... my archives,

323
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,870
And found some very intriguing information.

324
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:54,051
I found passages about a gospel of
De Molay in a 16th century document.

325
00:38:54,151 --> 00:38:57,030
De Molay, the grandmaster of the Knights Templar?

326
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:03,530
I think Bartholomew, somehow got the gospel and hid it.

327
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:11,600
All the Russian cemeteries, during the
14th to 16th century’s, where by churches.

328
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,250
It would make sense for him, to hide it there.

329
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:19,510
I love a good mystery.

330
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:27,850
But of course, I'm aware of that, trust me,
we'll get your money back, if it's the last thing I do.

331
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:33,700
As soon as I find him, I will let you know,
I just need more time.

332
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,790
Yes, I understand.

333
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,890
Yea ok... adios.

334
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,270
I want the money and the cocaine back.

335
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,770
Hey...

336
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,680
I think, we just got a little closer to our goal.

337
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:22,490
- Michael, you always drive like this?
- Yea man, it's one of the many bad habits, I've developed in Moscow.

338
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,070
Bad habits you've developed? This is insanity.

339
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,770
Well listen, if you don't drive aggressively
in Moscow, you just don’t get anywhere.

340
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,360
I've noticed.

341
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:45,490
Michaelito... Michaelito don't let me down, I just
put my entire travel allowance, on this race.

342
00:40:45,491 --> 00:40:49,220
- Yea well don't worry about it, I got a bundle on it too,
- Good.

343
00:40:49,221 --> 00:40:53,420
Besides... it isn’t no fun,
unless you risk more then you can afford.

344
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,160
- So you're still after my pendant, Professor?
- A ha...

345
00:40:57,619 --> 00:40:59,119
Okay...

346
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:04,550
Did you bring any money?
We don't take cheques, you know, only cash.

347
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,880
- Do you accept dollars?
- Will we?

348
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,150
Oh yea, we'll accept dollars.

349
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,125
- We will take your dollars, professor.
- Good.

350
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:17,120
Well, you just look after that thing,
I wouldn't wane leave, without it.

351
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:22,040
Always an optimist,
even if defeat's... staring in your face.

352
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,680
Well, good luck to you, let's see.

353
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,830
I just came out to watch you race.

354
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,780
- Well, how did you know these was going on?
- Well, the races are not exactly a secret.

355
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,090
- Yea, I guess not.
- Who's the big guy.

356
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:49,570
- They call him Wolf.
- And you're racing him for his amulet?

357
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,320
Well,

358
00:41:53,321 --> 00:41:56,160
I just came out, to wish you good luck.

359
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,350
- Hey... what's up professor?
- I don't get it?

360
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,510
- I thought you and Wolf where together.
- We are together.

361
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:27,039
Oh...

362
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,700
You didn't know that Wolf and Masha,
are brother and sister, did you?

363
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:33,339
No, I didn't.

364
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,830
That explains it all.

365
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,230
- There's not a lot you know much about Masha?... huh.
- Yea obviously.

366
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,005
She and her brother are very close,
like he raised her...

367
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:50,020
financed her education, the entire time
he was in the Foreign Legion.

368
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,330
You really should get to know him,
don't... judge a book by its cover.

369
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:57,630
- So anyway.
- You're right.

370
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:04,170
There is one problem though, I mean...
the thing's Masha been dealing with.

371
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,370
- What?
- I think... I think she's fallen in love.

372
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,380
- It doesn't sound like a... bad problem.
- You better focus on the race.

373
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,830
Hey baby... are you alright?

374
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,630
I'm okay, go win the race.

375
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,670
At least, I beat Wolf.

376
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:03,399
Professor!

377
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:08,660
- I guess the pendant is mine.
- No, no, no, it's not yours, you came in 2nd.

378
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,150
What're you talking about? We agreed,
the winner was the one of us, who came in 1st.

379
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,910
No, you had to win the race,
Pretty Boy won the race.

380
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,550
Hey, Pretty Boy, looking good brother.

381
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,870
But don't worry professor, you know...

382
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,440
if you try really hard next time,
you can win this, have a good night.

383
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:36,860
Are you crazy, why did you stop during the race?

384
00:46:38,539 --> 00:46:39,739
You know...

385
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,140
some things are more important than winning, brother

386
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,120
What're doing tomorrow?

387
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,960
Are you asking me out?

388
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,730
Maybe.

389
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:47,880
This is Michael Nazarro, an American,
they spotted him with Wolf.

390
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,910
A (?) from the FSB, it turns out he spent two
years in Colombia before coming to Russia.

391
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:56,570
Where he made a lot of money, after discovering
a site of ancient archaeological artifacts.

392
00:47:57,512 --> 00:48:00,610
- An archaeologist drug trafficker.
- Exactly.

393
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:06,830
Nazarro was a professor at Chicago University, he is
on an exchange program, at the University of Moscow.

394
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:12,230
It's also shown, that he served two years in the
US. army, and is a graduate of West Point.

395
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:19,580
We think he is an operative for the Cartel,
and the final photograph is Pablo Ramirez...

396
00:48:19,581 --> 00:48:21,459
a doctor from Bogota.

397
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:25,790
Now Ramirez just arrived in Moscow,
probably to review the organization.

398
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:30,710
He and Nazarro, were connected in Colombia,
and Nazarro is listed on Ramirez's visa...

399
00:48:30,711 --> 00:48:32,710
as one of the contacts here in Moscow.

400
00:48:32,711 --> 00:48:39,059
Ramirez changed his flight out of Moscow two days
early, we should bring him in now, he's a flight risk.

401
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:46,640
When you connect the dots, let me know, until then, we
don't, we sit out, we don't need any more bad press.

402
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,340
- What do you want?
- Ah... listen real good.

403
00:49:16,341 --> 00:49:20,950
From this point forward, I own you,
your life is in my hands.

404
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:25,670
- But you don't understand.
- No, no, no, I understand.

405
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:30,320
Your boyfriend owes me a lot of money, and in
return, I owe my partner a lot of money...

406
00:49:30,321 --> 00:49:36,300
and it just snowballs from there...
I need him to return to me, what he owes me.

407
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,660
- Wolf will kill you.
- Not if I kill him first.

408
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,710
We found Wolf's garage and he is alone.

409
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,840
- Well then it's time to take him out.
- No problem.

410
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:51,940
- Bo... don't fail me.
- Okay.

411
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:02,630
If you weren't so pretty, I would kill you right now.

412
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,150
Hello.

413
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,150
Wolf! Something has happened.

414
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,870
Hey, my sister, what's wrong? Just calm down.

415
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:31,020
- Lena was kidnapped, - What? - I
called you, but you didn't answer.

416
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,090
Where are you?

417
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,040
- At Karenitze's.
- Stay there.

418
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:41,160
- Wolf, tell me who is this?
- I think, I know.

419
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,680
Give me the phone, fast.

420
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,570
Wolf...

421
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:55,170
You've got some visitors, in the front of the garage.

422
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,310
Sir! Something just went down at Wolf's garage.

423
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,780
Down!

424
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:55,780
Stay down!

425
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,380
- Hello.
- Karenitze.

426
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,080
- Thank God, you're alive.
- What the hell is going on?

427
00:52:26,081 --> 00:52:29,230
Beekeeper has Lena, on top of the Bergman building.

428
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,330
Tell Masha to go to my hideout,
she should wait for me there.

429
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,780
Give me your gun.

430
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,780
Go... go.

431
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,890
Don't worry baby, you're save now.

432
00:53:53,891 --> 00:53:56,190
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

433
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,370
- Just kill him.
- Don't be stupid.

434
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:03,040
Look... on the count of three, I'm gonna
loose my gun, and you will let her go, okay.

435
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:05,450
One...

436
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,310
And two...

437
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,390
And three.

438
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,490
All right, don't worry, it's over now.

439
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:29,110
You can't believe how worried I was.

440
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:35,180
- That was close.
- I thought, I was gonna die.

441
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:53,880
- Oh... Michael.
- I came as fast as I could.

442
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,630
You okay?

443
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,510
- Well, I heard about your garage.
- Aah...

444
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,370
Hey, I thought they destroyed your car too?

445
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,430
Hey, wait a minute...

446
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:16,350
Okay, you got me.

447
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,670
Your 10 Grant.

448
00:55:28,671 --> 00:55:31,840
You know, I thought you came out
of that tunnel a little fast.

449
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,840
This is a special car.

450
00:55:34,841 --> 00:55:40,360
Not as fast as the other, but this baby
has some very unique features.

451
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,690
Yea, but more important than that, what about those guys?
Who did this?

452
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:50,310
If I tell you... of them, I'll have to kill you.

453
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,140
Well, let me explain.

454
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,319
Mr.. Ramirez?

455
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:23,020
Now that I've told you everything, I need you
to be straight with me.

456
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:26,040
Why do you want my pendant so bad?.

457
00:56:28,045 --> 00:56:29,545
Well... ah...

458
00:56:29,546 --> 00:56:32,000
Without boring you with all the history.

459
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:38,330
I am trying to find a treasure, which
I believe to be in Moscow.

460
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:43,030
- Oh, by the way Masha, I think I've located that cemetery.
- Mm...

461
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:47,890
I really think, we should check it out,
hey... we all should.

462
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:51,910
I think we'll find something, that leads
us to the gospel of De Molay.

463
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:56,170
- Why is my pendant come in?
- It decodes the gospel.

464
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:02,950
In other words... if we could find the lost
treasure of the Knights Templar.

465
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:07,400
That my friend... is worth more than money.

466
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:12,080
When I was in the Foreign Legion,
I served with this French soldier.

467
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:16,580
Our unit suffered many casualties one day
on the battlefield.

468
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:25,140
As my French friend was dying, he told me he had
no family left... and want me to have the pendant.

469
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:32,140
He said it was special, but before he could
explain why, he died.

470
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,860
He must have been one of the descendants of the
original knights.

471
00:57:35,861 --> 00:57:37,560
Tomorrow, we take the trip to the cemetery.

472
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,920
- What are you doing here in Russia?
- I'm a physician.

473
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:47,370
I'm here to speak at a the international
symposium on the aid, to 3rd world countries.

474
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:53,260
- Is that what you're calling it now.
- Calling what?

475
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,530
Establishing a drug trafficking network, from Colombia,
you call it an international symposium?

476
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:01,550
Colonel, you have a very distorted view of our country.

477
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:07,080
Just because I'm from Colombia, doesn't mean
I'm a drug dealer... I told you, I'm a doctor.

478
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:12,840
Drugs were invented by doctors...
what about your principles and believes.

479
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:20,660
I believe you are a desperate man,
try to implicate an innocent man.

480
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,580
Excuse me Sir...

481
00:58:23,981 --> 00:58:30,280
We just got a call from the Colombian intelligent
bureau, his record is... clean.

482
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:37,590
You are free to go, doctor.

483
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,770
Colonel.

484
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,040
That's it.

485
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,370
I've never seen anything like this.

486
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:36,230
This is very interesting, this is the cantos,
the symbol of the Knights Templar.

487
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:43,430
Air, water, fire, earth, all united by the holy spirit.

488
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:49,720
What you're trying to do, Michael?

489
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:54,440
Trying to move it, I think... there's got to be
something underneath there.

490
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:56,210
Let me try.

491
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:30,160
- Is this your bell?
- Yea... that's my bell.

492
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,379
Alright.

493
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:40,560
Okay, we can take a look... may I have your pendant?

494
01:00:53,251 --> 01:00:55,150
Well...

495
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:59,150
- I can't see where it fits.
- It says here...

496
01:00:59,151 --> 01:01:06,530
This bell was made by Bartholomew, to the
arches of Spotges Sabina.

497
01:01:06,531 --> 01:01:10,060
That's a huge area, there's hundreds of churches.

498
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:17,040
- Let's go see the curator.
- Who is the curator?

499
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,690
You'll see.

500
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,800
Who would do this? He never hurt anyone.

501
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,710
I've got an idea, but I... I hope, I'm wrong.

502
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,690
Let's get out of here.

503
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,830
Wait a second.

504
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,460
This calendar is different from
the last time we were here.

505
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,260
Why would he change it?

506
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:13,830
That's odd, this calendar says 1999.

507
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:20,510
Look, hand written these are the symbols
of the Knights Templar.

508
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:26,260
I think your curator found the place,
where our bell belongs.

509
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:30,850
I know this place, this is the church of
Michael the Archangel.

510
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,640
Have you lost something?

511
01:02:55,641 --> 01:02:57,830
Ouch... ah...

512
01:02:57,831 --> 01:03:02,930
No, no... oh, well, there you are, we've
been looking for you.

513
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,060
You were looking for me on the ground?

514
01:03:06,561 --> 01:03:08,690
Oh, no, no, ah...

515
01:03:08,691 --> 01:03:13,950
I'm a historian, we were told this church
was pre 16th century.

516
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:17,850
I was just looking for some conformation
of the date, but I found nothing.

517
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:22,630
It's not here, this church is from the 18th century.

518
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,980
We thought the church was here.

519
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:33,640
You know, I'm a historian too, look it this way,

520
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:40,170
There's hundreds of churches in the area,
we're looking for an older one.

521
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:45,230
We do have a church, built in the
16th century, a small one.

522
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:49,330
- Where?
- Next door.

523
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:05,040
So that one, is the church of Michael the
Archangel, right, 18th century.

524
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:09,570
But this one, my friends, is the church
of Spotges Sabina 16th century.

525
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:43,820
- Oh, I don't know guys,
- Michael.

526
01:04:43,821 --> 01:04:46,020
It's just one dead end after another.

527
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:10,540
- This is it, that's what we've been looking for.
- You're sure?

528
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:17,560
Yea... look here now...
According to Bartholomew... we should be...

529
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:21,420
Three steps east, right?

530
01:05:21,421 --> 01:05:23,119
One...

531
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,820
Two...

532
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,620
Three...

533
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:30,260
Two foot down...

534
01:05:30,961 --> 01:05:32,460
And, one...

535
01:05:32,961 --> 01:05:33,960
Two...

536
01:05:34,961 --> 01:05:36,760
And four stones.

537
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,910
Sounds hollow.

538
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:52,470
Okay now, let me see.

539
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:02,980
Wow...

540
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,280
All we needed was a feminine touch.

541
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:26,220
Come on professor, did you find something?

542
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:43,550
Michael.

543
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:47,450
Ladies and gentlemen...

544
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,990
Michael.

545
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,590
The Gospel of De Molay.

546
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,050
- What're doing?
- Bravo, Michael.

547
01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:03,380
Bravo.

548
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,380
I thought something didn't smell quiet right about you.

549
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,870
Let's not make things ugly.

550
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:15,240
Just, give me the Gospel and the amulet,
and we all be on our way.

551
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:23,810
Let's be reasonable, you're a big man,
but not big enough to stop a bullet.

552
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,500
Thank you.

553
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,300
What're you doing, Pierre?

554
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:45,220
Many years ago, my ancestors swore
to the King of France...

555
01:07:45,221 --> 01:07:49,930
that they would find the treasure
of the Order of the Knights Templar.

556
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:54,570
Would you like to know my mother's maiden name?

557
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:59,310
Let me guess... Nogaret.

558
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:04,130
You are smart, too smart for your own good.

559
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:10,720
Ah... or, perhaps not, after all you led me
to the amulet, the gospel...

560
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:13,770
and ultimately to the treasure.

561
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:19,730
There's one thing, you didn't know.

562
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:25,550
If you want to decode the Gospel,
you need two amulets.

563
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:33,590
You never guess who has the other amulet… me.

564
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:35,490
Ah... yes.

565
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:42,270
This is not the real amulet, where is it?

566
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,050
That's all I got.

567
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:47,370
I'm not stupid, this is not the amulet
you have been wearing.

568
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:53,390
I'm telling you the truth, you're in Russia now,
you know our problem...

569
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:56,110
You never put your eggs in one basket.

570
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,250
Let me tell you my problem, take her.

571
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:05,050
You give me the real amulet, and no one will get hurt.

572
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:12,200
If you lay one finger on her, or hurt her in anyway,
I swear, I will kill you with my own hands.

573
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:17,130
You know, it sounds as though you could almost do it, professor.

574
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:22,940
Get me the amulet, if you ever want to see her again.

575
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:28,470
It's alright... all right.

576
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:39,970
You got the real pendant?

577
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:42,530
You still got the real pendant, right?

578
01:09:42,531 --> 01:09:46,550
Yea, I got the real pendant, I switched it at the last moment for safety...

579
01:09:46,551 --> 01:09:51,150
if I hadn't done it, we wouldn't be in this mess,
and Masha would be safe.

580
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:56,210
No you're wrong, if you hadn't made the switch
we all be dead.

581
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:19,830
- That smells good, Pepperoni?
- Cheese.

582
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:24,530
It's open.

583
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:31,180
You can just put it on the table.

584
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:47,300
What you're doing?

585
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:51,250
- Get out of my house.
- Okay.

586
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:58,205
On second thought... I don't think so.

587
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:02,790
You and your friends been (?) my job,
my partner is not happy.

588
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,140
To tell the truth, neither am I.

589
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:15,350
Now... I don't know what else, so tell me,
where is the money and the cocaine.

590
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,450
Oh... where's the money and the coke?

591
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:25,160
The coke is in the river, where it got to be.

592
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:29,990
Really, for your sake, I hope not.

593
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:02,340
I think I just found the big bad wolf.

594
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:22,200
I hope you know what you're doing.

595
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,690
It's a little trick I learned at West Point.

596
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:28,610
I never thought I have to use it, Pierre
is not gonna know what hit him.

597
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:35,270
- Who is this guy Pierre Saminault?
- He's a historian, it's said he's one of the best in his field.

598
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:40,490
But it also appears he's a descendant of the
persecutors of the Knights Templar.

599
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:46,420
One of his ancestors, by royal degree,
arrested the Knights and tortcherd them...

600
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:50,590
in the hopes of finding the treasure.

601
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:52,210
What happened?

602
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:58,650
His great, great, grandson, is about to succeed.

603
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:12,770
Meet me at the old shipyard in 3 hours,
and bring me the amulet,

604
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:14,480
The real amulet.

605
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:18,280
My patience is running thin.

606
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,520
We're on.

607
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:04,110
- Ok, I got what you want.
- It will better fit, this time.

608
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:07,440
It does.

609
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:13,810
Now let her go, or the pendant and your dreams, drown.

610
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:17,470
Don't worry, I'm not a violent man.

611
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,530
Let her go.

612
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,030
Ah... yes.

613
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:46,930
Now, you know, I can't just let you walk away.

614
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,150
Go ahead...

615
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,070
Get after them.

616
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,730
After them.

617
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:27,060
- That's not good.
- Tell me about it.

618
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:40,520
Are you crazy?

619
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:48,400
You wanna play? Let's play.

620
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:14,060
Come on man, that was to close.

621
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,810
The De Molay's curse, again.

622
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,630
Another one of Nogaret's descendants, died in flames

623
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:37,490
I'm glad our descendants didn't have any curses.

624
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,840
- You're a crazy driver, you know that.
- I know that.

625
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:53,790
- These things really work.
- He's got my GPS.

626
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:59,140
Amazing... I have a little surprise for you, I'm sure
you're going to like it.

627
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:03,290
Especially you, Mr. Nazarro.

628
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:12,490
- You need to get better friends.
- This has not been my day.

629
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,500
Pablo why?

630
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:24,430
I come from a struggling nation, I see people
starving, and dying from disease every day.

631
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:30,820
The only way to make a different, money! Lots of money.

632
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:38,320
It's difficult for you to understand, but with
drug sales, I can actually help my people.

633
01:21:38,321 --> 01:21:39,920
Come on, Pablo...

634
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,920
You know as well as I do, drugs are part of the problem.

635
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,280
I like you, Michael,

636
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:50,580
But, I will not let you, or anyone else, stop me.

637
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:03,550
Doctor...

638
01:22:03,551 --> 01:22:07,050
I thought doctors were suppose to cure people not kill them.

639
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:14,290
Got you now, Beekeeper.

640
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:20,410
Maybe yes, maybe no, maybe rain, maybe snow...

641
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:33,080
As for you three, I only have three
months for me to retire.

642
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:36,030
Colonel, what about Wolf?

643
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,610
What about him, he's done more to stop
crime then we have.

644
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:42,740
You want to arrest him? Go ahead.

645
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:49,850
Thank you, Colonel.

646
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,180
- Wait, wait, wait, wait...
- Michael be careful.

647
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:04,570
The Gospel.

648
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:11,140
- Can you imagine, we'd end up with that.
- Everything but the actual treasure.

649
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:21,750
What does it mean?

650
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:24,550
- Job.
- Job?

651
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:29,210
Yea, it's from the Bible, he was the man
who lost everything,

652
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:32,780
His wealth, his family, his friends... just like De Molay.

653
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,770
We need to find out where Job is buried.

654
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:40,330
- Where did he live?
- The Arabian desert.

655
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:47,490
