1
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:32,097
Domesticated fowl.

2
00:03:32,132 --> 00:03:34,859
It's a fuckin' chicken.

3
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:52,234
You remember that old
joke about the chicken crossing

4
00:03:52,254 --> 00:03:53,878
the road?

5
00:03:53,912 --> 00:03:55,086
Well, there's at least one

6
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,916
version where it doesn't end
too good for the chicken.

7
00:04:02,783 --> 00:04:03,991
I don't know about you, but I

8
00:04:04,026 --> 00:04:08,340
don't see anything funny about
dead animals.

9
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:11,343
When I was a boy, I always
wondered if dead animals went

10
00:04:11,378 --> 00:04:13,656
to heaven, but my foster mother

11
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:16,763
told me animals don't got souls.

12
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:19,593
Well, I tend to disagree.

13
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,221
The saddest part of the job are the pets...

14
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:30,777
It just tears my heart out to
see 'em that way.

15
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:34,297
If things were up to me, I'd
give every one of these little

16
00:04:34,332 --> 00:04:37,680
guys a proper burial to help
'em move on to a better place.

17
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:42,996
The county don't see it that way.

18
00:05:19,826 --> 00:05:23,795
Paper or plastic?

19
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,695
Well, Bucky, it sounds like you
got a problem.

20
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:27,868
I didn't say that.

21
00:05:27,903 --> 00:05:29,732
Well, what did you say?

22
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:32,148
Well, it was like I told you,
you know, Becky does want a

23
00:05:32,183 --> 00:05:34,737
family and all, but I want the same thing.

24
00:05:34,772 --> 00:05:39,224
I'm not sure I'm ready to be
a father yet, that's all.

25
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:43,988
And heck, I grew up without a daddy.

26
00:05:44,022 --> 00:05:48,786
Well, have you told Becky how you feel?

27
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,303
Bucky, have you?

28
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:50,546
No!

29
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,321
Damn it, Bucky, the last
thing you need is some little

30
00:05:52,341 --> 00:05:53,722
brat running around your house.

31
00:05:53,756 --> 00:05:55,447
You're still a damn kid yourself.

32
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:57,498
You should've never gotten
married in the first damn place.

33
00:05:57,518 --> 00:05:58,485
But I love her.

34
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:03,421
But that ain't no reason to get married.

35
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:05,803
That's six pounds, two ounces.

36
00:06:05,837 --> 00:06:08,391
Now, if she wants to get
pregnant, how the hell do you

37
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:10,773
plan on stoppin' her?

38
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:11,823
I've done the research and

39
00:06:11,843 --> 00:06:12,843
uh...

40
00:06:13,603 --> 00:06:15,122
Kind of developed a technique.

41
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:16,399
Excuse me?

42
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:19,092
Technique... it's kind of like
a system that I worked out.

43
00:06:19,126 --> 00:06:20,369
O.K.

44
00:06:20,403 --> 00:06:22,854
They say that sperm cells
can't live long under adverse

45
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:23,924
conditions.

46
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:24,925
Go on.

47
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,479
I just created my own adverse conditions.

48
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:29,861
What the hell are you talkin' about?

49
00:06:29,896 --> 00:06:32,154
As little as a 10-degree rise
in body temperature will kill

50
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:34,728
off most of your sperm cells.

51
00:06:34,763 --> 00:06:35,778
So what are you doing, Bucky,

52
00:06:35,798 --> 00:06:42,771
microwaving your nuts every night?

53
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:43,772
Hand warmers.

54
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:45,532
Put two of 'em in my underwear every day.

55
00:06:45,566 --> 00:06:48,224
That's gotta lower my sperm count.

56
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:52,746
Damn, Bucky, I think you done
lowered your brain cell count.

57
00:06:52,781 --> 00:06:53,816
It seems to be working.

58
00:06:53,851 --> 00:06:54,714
How can you tell?

59
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,888
Well, she ain't pregnant yet, we uh...

60
00:06:57,647 --> 00:06:59,788
Pretty much do it all the time.

61
00:06:59,822 --> 00:07:03,792
How much?

62
00:07:03,826 --> 00:07:06,070
How much, Bucky?

63
00:07:06,104 --> 00:07:07,105
Oh, well, yeah.

64
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,486
Six pounds, two ounces.

65
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,076
Yes!

66
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,302
Come in cr-one.

67
00:07:17,322 --> 00:07:18,565
Come in CR-1.

68
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:21,292
Here, Bucky, I'll get that.

69
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,128
Go for Earl.

70
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:31,405
Hey, Earl.

71
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,800
Paul wants you boys to meet him
over on highway six near the

72
00:07:33,822 --> 00:07:35,789
county line.

73
00:07:35,824 --> 00:07:36,825
Now?

74
00:07:36,858 --> 00:07:39,275
Damn straight, and don't be late.

75
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,208
10-4.

76
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:42,520
Shit.

77
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:57,052
Hey, Paul, is the county paying
us to leave critters in the road

78
00:07:57,086 --> 00:07:58,812
now?

79
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,504
Gentlemen, here's the situation.

80
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:04,576
Now, uh, America has more than
four million miles of roads and

81
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:07,821
highways and they're all
littered with road kill.

82
00:08:07,856 --> 00:08:10,997
Modern day wildlife management,
critter control by family

83
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:12,308
vehicle.

84
00:08:12,343 --> 00:08:14,497
And for every dead carcass you
find beside the road, you know

85
00:08:14,517 --> 00:08:17,900
that there's 10 more you can't
see off in the bushes somewhere

86
00:08:17,935 --> 00:08:19,522
and it's getting out of hand.

87
00:08:19,557 --> 00:08:20,558
I don't get it, Paul.

88
00:08:20,592 --> 00:08:21,870
What's this all about?

89
00:08:21,904 --> 00:08:24,024
Well, what it's about, Bucky,
is the world is changing and we

90
00:08:24,044 --> 00:08:25,321
got to change with it.

91
00:08:25,356 --> 00:08:28,497
Now what you boys are about to
witness is a mechanical marvel

92
00:08:28,531 --> 00:08:31,017
of carcass removal technology.

93
00:08:31,051 --> 00:08:35,021
Gentlemen, let me introduce you
to the new CRT-3000.

94
00:08:44,512 --> 00:08:47,965
It's powered by a 10-cylinder
turbo diesel, stacked with a

95
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:50,001
two-cycle afterburner and

96
00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:53,039
muffled exhaust that generates
an environmental friendly

97
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:54,903
S.P.L. of less than 25...

98
00:08:54,937 --> 00:08:55,973
[voice fades, becoming

99
00:09:02,945 --> 00:09:04,395
Bucky!

100
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:13,231
Now wait just a goddamn minute!

101
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,063
There ain't but one son of a
bitch in that thing.

102
00:09:17,097 --> 00:09:21,619
Well, I know, that's
the beauty of the thing...

103
00:09:21,653 --> 00:09:22,654
Or not.

104
00:09:22,689 --> 00:09:24,898
That's what I wanted to talk to
you boys about.

105
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:27,418
See, uh, if the committee goes
with this plan we got no choice.

106
00:09:27,452 --> 00:09:29,213
We cannot justify two salaries.

107
00:09:29,247 --> 00:09:30,559
We just can't do it.

108
00:09:30,593 --> 00:09:32,354
That's a crock of shit, Paul.

109
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:54,307
Did I mention the internal incinerator?

110
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,460
Well, anyway, boys, that's the

111
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,724
way it's got to be and it's
really out of my hands.

112
00:09:57,758 --> 00:09:58,967
I'm sorry.

113
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:00,209
Hey!

114
00:10:00,244 --> 00:10:03,109
First it was those goddamn
biodegradable bags and it's shit

115
00:10:03,143 --> 00:10:06,457
if we don't go computerized, and
we put up with all that crap so

116
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:09,356
you can just go ahead and can our asses?

117
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:11,980
Not "asses" as in plural, Earl.

118
00:10:12,014 --> 00:10:13,636
"Ass" as in one.

119
00:10:13,671 --> 00:10:15,397
Well, that's bullshit, Paul.

120
00:10:15,431 --> 00:10:18,607
O.K., look, now if you want
me to say who's staying and

121
00:10:18,641 --> 00:10:19,711
who's going, I'll do it.

122
00:10:19,746 --> 00:10:21,092
I thought maybe you'd want to

123
00:10:21,127 --> 00:10:25,027
figure it out amongst yourselves.

124
00:10:51,122 --> 00:10:54,090
The job is yours.

125
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,163
Don't even give it a second thought.

126
00:10:57,197 --> 00:11:00,097
I can't just take the job from Earl.

127
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:03,100
He's the one who got me the job
in the first place.

128
00:11:03,134 --> 00:11:04,066
I owe him.

129
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:07,104
Your owe your family more.

130
00:11:07,138 --> 00:11:09,175
Or do I need to remind you,
we're in the family

131
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:11,522
manufacturing business.

132
00:11:11,556 --> 00:11:14,145
We're gonna need some elbow room
once the little one shows up.

133
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,803
I mean, if you're out of a job,
we ain't never gonna get that

134
00:11:16,837 --> 00:11:17,977
double-wide you promised me.

135
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,773
Not to mention a new dress for
the talent competition.

136
00:11:21,808 --> 00:11:26,088
It's gonna be so fantastic, me
up there just a-singin'...

137
00:11:26,123 --> 00:11:29,195
You know, I was thinking of
getting a blue dress, you know,

138
00:11:29,229 --> 00:11:32,681
kind of low-cut and sexy.

139
00:11:32,715 --> 00:11:34,062
I mean, just a little bit...

140
00:11:35,787 --> 00:11:37,065
Sex does sell.

141
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:37,997
And no use

142
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,309
concealing what the good lord gave me.

143
00:11:40,344 --> 00:11:42,035
'Cause remember last year...

144
00:11:53,805 --> 00:11:59,708
Bucky... Honey?

145
00:11:59,742 --> 00:12:04,126
Yeah.

146
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:06,197
I don't know what my
temperature has to do with

147
00:12:06,232 --> 00:12:07,247
making babies, but let's just go

148
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:08,510
make sure.

149
00:12:08,544 --> 00:12:11,616
O.K., I'll be right there.

150
00:12:49,206 --> 00:12:51,415
You know what?

151
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:53,555
I've been thinking about new trucks.

152
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:54,625
Is that right?

153
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:57,835
Yeah.

154
00:12:57,869 --> 00:13:02,253
The way I see it...

155
00:13:02,288 --> 00:13:05,670
You were never much to liking
this job anyway, were ya?

156
00:13:05,705 --> 00:13:09,571
It seems as how Becky and I
got... You know, family plans

157
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:13,471
and all...

158
00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:14,886
I was thinkin' maybe I ought to

159
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:18,235
take the county job.

160
00:13:22,308 --> 00:13:24,310
Seems like the right thing.

161
00:13:24,344 --> 00:13:27,313
Is that so?

162
00:13:27,347 --> 00:13:30,316
Give it a crank.

163
00:13:32,214 --> 00:13:35,217
Jimmy!

164
00:13:35,252 --> 00:13:36,252
Jimmy!

165
00:13:37,737 --> 00:13:39,290
♪ I'd love to

166
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:40,547
♪ have a woman like the one you ♪

167
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:41,361
♪ have...

168
00:13:41,396 --> 00:13:43,881
Eddie, where's Jimmy at?

169
00:13:43,915 --> 00:13:44,916
I don't know.

170
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:46,780
He ain't under here, I can tell
you that much.

171
00:13:46,815 --> 00:13:49,404
Well, if you see him you tell
him to get his skinny little

172
00:13:49,438 --> 00:13:50,819
butt in there and clean up that

173
00:13:50,853 --> 00:13:55,824
mess he made in the living room. Jimmy!

174
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:58,171
How much longer are you gonna be?

175
00:13:58,206 --> 00:13:59,690
Bingo's at six.

176
00:13:59,724 --> 00:14:00,656
You ain't goin' anywhere

177
00:14:00,691 --> 00:14:02,831
unless I get this damn fuel pump fixed.

178
00:14:05,972 --> 00:14:07,056
Well, I see how you see

179
00:14:07,076 --> 00:14:10,632
it, and I know, man, you want
to start a family.

180
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,669
That is if you ain't already
burned your nuts off.

181
00:14:13,704 --> 00:14:17,880
But you gettin' the job would be
the right thing.

182
00:14:17,915 --> 00:14:20,849
But your old buddy here has been
looking after you way too long

183
00:14:20,883 --> 00:14:25,681
to see you do that to yourself.

184
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:26,648
Do what to myself?

185
00:14:26,682 --> 00:14:30,307
You got to confront your problems, Bucky.

186
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:31,480
You want the easy way out.

187
00:14:31,515 --> 00:14:34,518
You want the job just handed to you.

188
00:14:34,552 --> 00:14:37,210
Well, life don't work that way, man.

189
00:14:37,245 --> 00:14:39,661
Besides, man, if I just handed
you the job, what would you

190
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:42,353
learn from that, huh?

191
00:14:42,388 --> 00:14:45,218
What would you learn from that?

192
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:48,290
It's a job, not learning.

193
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:52,398
Man, a job comes, a job goes.

194
00:14:52,432 --> 00:14:54,779
But life's lessons...

195
00:14:59,474 --> 00:15:03,443
Shit!

196
00:15:03,478 --> 00:15:05,445
Jimmy!

197
00:15:45,382 --> 00:15:48,454
What the heck happened here, Ches?

198
00:15:48,488 --> 00:15:51,491
Figure old Ed, he busted the fuel line...

199
00:15:51,526 --> 00:15:54,529
Looks like it sparked off something.

200
00:15:58,774 --> 00:16:01,881
Funny old world, huh?

201
00:16:01,915 --> 00:16:05,298
Well, the work's over here.

202
00:16:20,658 --> 00:16:23,972
Oh, is that Roscoe?

203
00:16:24,006 --> 00:16:27,562
It's all right, Jimmy, you're
gonna be O.K., son.

204
00:16:27,596 --> 00:16:32,360
Sometimes... The good lord, he taketh away.

205
00:16:32,394 --> 00:16:36,364
Looks like he took ol' Roscoe
away with a vengeance.

206
00:16:44,544 --> 00:16:45,338
You get started, all right?

207
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:46,684
I'll be right back.

208
00:16:58,627 --> 00:17:00,388
Hey, Lizzy.

209
00:17:08,396 --> 00:17:10,536
You O.K.?

210
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,470
I'm sorry about Eddie.

211
00:17:20,408 --> 00:17:25,723
It's going to be O.K.

212
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:54,580
You want to hustle it up here, Click?

213
00:17:54,614 --> 00:18:01,207
Don't you see what this poor
kid's going through?

214
00:18:01,241 --> 00:18:04,969
Look at that.

215
00:18:05,004 --> 00:18:07,524
Hasn't been a widow woman an
hour and he's already sniffin'

216
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:10,458
out the territory.

217
00:18:10,492 --> 00:18:14,979
Swear to God.

218
00:18:15,014 --> 00:18:16,429
What's gotten into you?

219
00:18:16,464 --> 00:18:17,652
She's a woman in need,

220
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:20,433
Bucky, I was there to comfort her.

221
00:18:20,468 --> 00:18:22,539
She's a married woman.

222
00:18:22,573 --> 00:18:24,195
Was a married woman.

223
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,611
Earl, what if that little boy

224
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:28,614
walked in and caught you
"comforting" her, huh?

225
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:29,546
Drive, Bucky.

226
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,444
It ain't right, you gotta know that.

227
00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:33,619
Goddamn, look at that.

228
00:18:33,653 --> 00:18:35,621
What do you say let's give her a lift?

229
00:18:35,655 --> 00:18:38,486
No, let's say we don't, huh?

230
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,453
Hey, there, where you headed?

231
00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:42,490
Someplace called Walker Pass Road?

232
00:18:42,524 --> 00:18:43,525
What a coincidence.

233
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,575
We're headed that way too.

234
00:18:44,595 --> 00:18:47,149
No, we're not, we gotta get
back to the pit.

235
00:18:47,184 --> 00:18:54,916
Take it easy, Bucky, that pit
ain't goin' nowhere.

236
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,712
Hey, don't worry, we work for the county.

237
00:18:57,746 --> 00:18:59,817
My name's Earl.

238
00:18:59,852 --> 00:19:01,543
This is my partner.

239
00:19:01,578 --> 00:19:03,718
We call him hot pants.

240
00:19:03,752 --> 00:19:05,202
Hi, hot pants.

241
00:19:05,236 --> 00:19:06,514
I'm Tess.

242
00:19:06,548 --> 00:19:09,482
Well, we can take you down to
Broke Sky Bridge, but we gotta

243
00:19:09,517 --> 00:19:11,553
get back, we're on a tight schedule here.

244
00:19:11,588 --> 00:19:12,638
Here, let me get that for you.

245
00:19:12,658 --> 00:19:13,762
Thanks.

246
00:19:13,797 --> 00:19:15,212
Come on.

247
00:19:15,246 --> 00:19:18,180
I swear to God.

248
00:19:18,215 --> 00:19:19,768
Careful.

249
00:19:47,313 --> 00:19:51,800
So, uh, walker pass road
seems a bit out of the way.

250
00:19:51,835 --> 00:19:56,909
What you got waitin' for you out
there, your boyfriend?

251
00:19:56,943 --> 00:19:58,566
No?

252
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,154
Your girlfriend?

253
00:20:01,189 --> 00:20:03,709
My grandmother.

254
00:20:03,743 --> 00:20:06,090
Are you Bernice's granddaughter?

255
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,989
Apparently so.

256
00:20:08,023 --> 00:20:10,025
Well, you don't seem too sure.

257
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,648
'Cause I never met her.

258
00:20:11,682 --> 00:20:13,733
I mean, I basically bounced
around foster home to foster

259
00:20:13,753 --> 00:20:15,583
home my whole life.

260
00:20:15,617 --> 00:20:17,067
Never really had a family.

261
00:20:17,101 --> 00:20:19,138
So, here I am.

262
00:20:19,172 --> 00:20:20,326
What the hell is this?

263
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:24,557
Ding-a-ling-a-ling.

264
00:20:24,592 --> 00:20:28,837
What else you got here?

265
00:20:28,872 --> 00:20:32,807
Knock it off!

266
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,092
I know you didn't want me in
your truck, but I mean,

267
00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:45,302
sometimes it's a little scary
being on the road alone.

268
00:20:45,336 --> 00:20:50,203
I really appreciate you giving me a ride.

269
00:20:50,238 --> 00:20:51,377
Sure you're gonna be O.K.?

270
00:20:51,411 --> 00:20:54,207
Yeah, I made it all the way
from Akron, didn't i?

271
00:20:54,242 --> 00:20:56,865
Say, how about me and you
hook up a little bit later and,

272
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,936
uh, I could show you all the hot spots?

273
00:20:58,971 --> 00:20:59,834
Yeah, show me all

274
00:20:59,868 --> 00:21:04,839
the hot spots you passed out drunk.

275
00:21:04,873 --> 00:21:07,704
Thanks, Mr. Earl, county worker.

276
00:21:07,738 --> 00:21:09,824
Hey, you know, it's actually
not as late as I thought.

277
00:21:09,844 --> 00:21:12,329
We could run you up there, we could.

278
00:21:12,363 --> 00:21:13,261
No, that's O.K.

279
00:21:13,295 --> 00:21:14,952
Thanks anyway.

280
00:21:27,965 --> 00:21:32,038
Hey, if you change your
mind, I'm in the book!

281
00:21:41,358 --> 00:21:43,947
Damn, Bucky, I don't know why
you waste the Good Lord's time

282
00:21:43,981 --> 00:21:48,814
asking him to bless a dick's
full of rotten meat and bones.

283
00:21:48,848 --> 00:21:50,367
They're god's creatures.

284
00:21:50,401 --> 00:21:51,782
They deserve a proper burial...

285
00:21:51,817 --> 00:21:52,680
Not just thrown out in some

286
00:21:52,714 --> 00:21:54,889
garbage out in the middle of nowhere.

287
00:21:54,923 --> 00:21:56,166
Well, if the county decides

288
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,997
on that mechanical marvel wonder
truck, all this is history.

289
00:22:00,032 --> 00:22:02,828
And you can blame that goddamn Paul.

290
00:22:02,862 --> 00:22:04,795
He thinks he's a damn genius.

291
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,658
He's the worst goddamn partner

292
00:22:05,693 --> 00:22:06,417
I ever had.

293
00:22:06,452 --> 00:22:08,316
He couldn't work worth of shit.

294
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,973
And now he's a supervisor.

295
00:22:37,897 --> 00:22:38,897
78, not bad.

296
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:49,357
132?

297
00:22:50,772 --> 00:22:54,742
Goddamn.

298
00:22:54,776 --> 00:22:56,364
I think I figured it out.

299
00:22:56,398 --> 00:22:57,296
Figured what out?

300
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,607
How to save our asses.

301
00:22:58,642 --> 00:23:01,403
Now, we're gonna have to work
our nuts to the bone for a few

302
00:23:01,438 --> 00:23:04,337
weeks, but we can do it, Bucky.

303
00:23:04,372 --> 00:23:05,649
Now, listen up.

304
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:08,790
Now, the county's gonna vote on
that new truck in a few weeks,

305
00:23:08,825 --> 00:23:10,171
so in the meantime, here's what

306
00:23:10,205 --> 00:23:11,724
we do.

307
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,072
You wanna run that by me again?

308
00:23:15,107 --> 00:23:19,801
Well, basically Earl wants to
make the Burr County mechanical

309
00:23:19,836 --> 00:23:24,944
marvel look bad... So's our own
county supervisors will vote

310
00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:29,017
against buying one for themselves.

311
00:23:29,052 --> 00:23:31,123
And you're gonna do that

312
00:23:31,157 --> 00:23:36,162
by stealing dead animals in the
middle of the night.

313
00:23:36,197 --> 00:23:39,441
Yeah... From Burr County.

314
00:23:39,476 --> 00:23:42,790
So...

315
00:23:42,824 --> 00:23:44,032
We can input all that in the

316
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:47,035
computer logs and take credit for it.

317
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,796
Our numbers go up and their's

318
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,902
go down, so...

319
00:23:51,937 --> 00:23:53,835
Why buy a new truck, right?

320
00:24:01,325 --> 00:24:05,226
Well, that sounds nuts to me.

321
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:08,194
But, if you think it's that
important to try to keep you two

322
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:12,958
together, I guess it's worth a try.

323
00:24:15,961 --> 00:24:17,514
When do you start?

324
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:25,108
I'm supposed to pick him up
at moose's at 11.

325
00:24:25,142 --> 00:24:26,592
Tonight?

326
00:24:26,626 --> 00:24:28,421
That's the plan, pickle.

327
00:24:28,456 --> 00:24:30,803
Oh...

328
00:24:31,908 --> 00:24:36,809

All right, we'll be right there.

349
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,336
What now?

350
00:26:30,371 --> 00:26:32,166
Well water smellin' bad.

351
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,203
Possum might've fallen in there
and drowned or something.

352
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:46,007
We better go check it out.

353
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:48,941
Hold on, Bucky, hold on.

354
00:26:48,976 --> 00:26:49,977
What's up?

355
00:26:50,011 --> 00:26:50,909
Look, this is only about a

356
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,290
half a mile from the Burr County line.

357
00:26:53,325 --> 00:26:55,948
Makes a lot more sense to check
this out tonight after we finish

358
00:26:55,983 --> 00:26:57,329
our rounds.

359
00:26:57,363 --> 00:26:59,124
Gonna put us there awful late, huh?

360
00:26:59,158 --> 00:27:01,471
Dispatch says this guy is all
kind of impatient.

361
00:27:01,505 --> 00:27:02,590
Well, that's all the better

362
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,026
reason to avoid the motherfucker.

363
00:27:05,061 --> 00:27:06,994
Trust me, Bucky, this is better, man.

364
00:27:07,028 --> 00:27:08,996
Take my word for it.

365
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:12,206
Well, are you gonna eat that or what?

366
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,049
Rufus, uh...

367
00:27:28,084 --> 00:27:28,912
Well, this gotta be it,

368
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,777
Bucky, it's the only house out here.

369
00:27:31,811 --> 00:27:35,091
Just pull in, man, let's get
this over with.

370
00:27:53,661 --> 00:27:55,042
Come on, Bucky, get the top off

371
00:27:55,076 --> 00:27:57,147
this thing.

372
00:28:03,636 --> 00:28:04,652
Damn, something crawled up and died here.

373
00:28:04,672 --> 00:28:08,193
God!

374
00:28:08,227 --> 00:28:11,990
Yeah...

375
00:28:26,245 --> 00:28:28,178
You got somethin'?

376
00:28:28,213 --> 00:28:29,421
No.

377
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,499
Hold on, there's something there.

378
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:41,778
Oh!

379
00:28:41,812 --> 00:28:43,814
Come on, Bucky, get the damn
thing out of there.

380
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:47,059
We don't want to be here all goddamn night.

381
00:28:47,094 --> 00:28:49,268
All right.

382
00:28:54,618 --> 00:28:59,175
Hang on.

383
00:28:59,209 --> 00:29:01,073
There's something...

384
00:29:01,108 --> 00:29:02,592
I see...

385
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:11,566
Ain't no possum, that's for sure.

386
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:38,593
It looks like it's weighed or something.

387
00:29:38,628 --> 00:29:39,318
Something kind of heavy.

388
00:29:39,353 --> 00:29:42,287
You want to give me a hand here?

389
00:29:46,532 --> 00:29:51,434
Oh, God!

390
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:13,801
All right, Bucky.

391
00:30:13,835 --> 00:30:16,148
You go to the truck and get that blue tarp.

392
00:30:16,183 --> 00:30:19,151
I'm gonna get that thing out of there.

393
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:22,465
Bucky, are you listening to me?

394
00:30:22,499 --> 00:30:23,515
We gotta go call Chester.

395
00:30:23,535 --> 00:30:24,329
No, no, no, man.

396
00:30:24,363 --> 00:30:30,162
You can forget that shit right now.

397
00:30:30,197 --> 00:30:33,165
Earl, did you hook up with
her the other night?

398
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,926
What?

399
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:38,550
You think I had something to do with this?

400
00:30:38,584 --> 00:30:42,174
- I don't think anything's up.
We gotta go call the sheriff.

401
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:44,901
No, hold on, hold on, Bucky.

402
00:30:44,935 --> 00:30:50,458
Goddamn it.

403
00:30:50,493 --> 00:30:52,564
All right, O.K., I'll tell you,

404
00:30:52,598 --> 00:30:54,186
I'll tell you the gospel truth.

405
00:30:54,221 --> 00:30:56,533
We did hook up the other night.

406
00:30:56,568 --> 00:30:58,984
But she was plenty alive when
she left my house the next

407
00:30:59,018 --> 00:30:59,812
morning, Bucky.

408
00:30:59,847 --> 00:31:02,332
Well, then we got a call to make!

409
00:31:02,367 --> 00:31:03,333
It ain't that simple, Bucky.

410
00:31:03,368 --> 00:31:05,853
My DNA's gonna be all over that.

411
00:31:05,887 --> 00:31:07,579
They're gonna think I killed her.

412
00:31:07,613 --> 00:31:10,306
Not if we tell 'em that you didn't.

413
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,618
Aw, man, with a record like mine?

414
00:31:12,653 --> 00:31:13,964
Go get the fucking tarp!

415
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:15,242
Goddamn it, Earl, we gotta

416
00:31:15,276 --> 00:31:18,383
tell somebody about this!

417
00:31:18,417 --> 00:31:21,662
Bucky...

418
00:31:21,696 --> 00:31:27,219
What, you want to see me fry for
something I didn't do?

419
00:31:27,254 --> 00:31:29,187
Go get the tarp.

420
00:31:50,346 --> 00:31:52,451
Move over, I'm driving.

421
00:31:57,353 --> 00:31:59,009
Where are we takin' her?

422
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:00,597
Where do you think?

423
00:32:00,632 --> 00:32:02,772
Oh, no, Earl, we're not taking her there.

424
00:32:02,806 --> 00:32:04,256
Are you out of your mind?

425
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:05,533
It's not for people!

426
00:32:05,568 --> 00:32:07,673
Exactly, Bucky, and nobody

427
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:09,813
ever goes out there but us.

428
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,399
This ain't right, Earl.

429
00:32:43,433 --> 00:32:46,747
We shouldn't be mixing human
spirits with animal spirits.

430
00:32:46,781 --> 00:32:49,646
It won't seem so bad come morning.

431
00:32:49,681 --> 00:32:53,409
No, she deserves a proper burial.

432
00:32:53,443 --> 00:32:54,064
Were things were different,

433
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:56,481
I'd say she'd have one.

434
00:32:56,515 --> 00:32:57,482
But things ain't like that,

435
00:32:57,516 --> 00:32:58,552
Bucky.

436
00:32:58,586 --> 00:33:01,348
You understand me?

437
00:33:01,382 --> 00:33:02,832
Now, after tonight, we never

438
00:33:02,866 --> 00:33:07,319
tell nobody about this, do you hear me?

439
00:33:07,354 --> 00:33:09,010
I mean nobody.

440
00:33:13,843 --> 00:33:15,638
How'd it go?

441
00:33:15,672 --> 00:33:16,639
It's all right, I guess.

442
00:33:16,673 --> 00:33:17,881
How much longer do you think

443
00:33:17,916 --> 00:33:19,607
you can keep this up?

444
00:33:19,642 --> 00:33:21,540
I mean, you look beat.

445
00:33:21,575 --> 00:33:24,474
You ain't never gonna get any decent sleep.

446
00:33:42,078 --> 00:33:43,528
Here lies the body of

447
00:33:43,562 --> 00:33:46,841
one of christ's beloved creatures.

448
00:33:46,876 --> 00:33:50,051
Fine, decent man...

449
00:33:50,086 --> 00:33:53,365
A leader of the community.

450
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,990
A loving husband and a dedicated father.

451
00:33:58,025 --> 00:34:01,546
Now he is gone and we are here

452
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:05,998
to see that he receives a proper
Christian internment which is

453
00:34:06,033 --> 00:34:12,004
his rightful due as a righteous
citizen of this community and an

454
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:14,972
active member of our parish.

455
00:34:15,006 --> 00:34:20,496
Little Jimmy McClinton,
to step forward now.

456
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:21,910
I'm going to ask you to sprinkle

457
00:34:21,945 --> 00:34:25,501
these rose petals on your father's grave...

458
00:34:26,571 --> 00:34:32,853
A sign of love and a symbol of
a new beginning.

459
00:34:32,887 --> 00:34:35,649
Let's all join in prayer.

460
00:34:35,682 --> 00:34:38,548
Thus says the Lord God,

461
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:42,414
all my people, I will open your
graves and have you rise from

462
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:44,519
them and bring you back to the

463
00:34:44,554 --> 00:34:46,660
land of Israel...

464
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:17,898
Thanks, Chester.

465
00:35:21,867 --> 00:35:23,490
What is the matter with you?

466
00:35:23,524 --> 00:35:24,801
Nothin'.

467
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:26,665
Bullshit, man, you're making a scene.

468
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,873
Now get a hold of yourself,

469
00:35:27,908 --> 00:35:29,096
Bucky, the last thing we need...

470
00:35:29,116 --> 00:35:32,050
Bucky?

471
00:35:32,084 --> 00:35:32,775
Hey, Becky.

472
00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:33,894
That was a beautiful service,

473
00:35:33,914 --> 00:35:36,710
wasn't it?

474
00:35:36,744 --> 00:35:40,438
Come on, Bucky, let's go home.

475
00:36:35,872 --> 00:36:39,151
Hey...

476
00:36:39,186 --> 00:36:44,191
You want to help me with this?

477
00:36:48,713 --> 00:36:52,648
Help me with this?

478
00:36:55,892 --> 00:36:56,686
Damn, Rufus.

479
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:59,965
Why don't you air this place out?

480
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,004
You are a venomous insect.

481
00:37:04,038 --> 00:37:06,282
Get your ass up.

482
00:37:06,316 --> 00:37:09,354
Get that thing on my knee
first, you stupid fuck.

483
00:37:09,388 --> 00:37:10,735
I might hose you off first.

484
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:11,977
Get your ass up.

485
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,112
We better get to work.

486
00:37:43,146 --> 00:37:44,631
Come on.

487
00:37:44,665 --> 00:37:45,839
Yeah, I just gotta clean up

488
00:37:45,873 --> 00:37:47,219
this mess real quick, thanks.

489
00:37:47,254 --> 00:37:48,151
All right, hurry up.

490
00:37:48,186 --> 00:37:50,119
O.K.

491
00:38:02,787 --> 00:38:06,791
That looks like a 12-pack to me.

492
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,079
There's a leg missing.

493
00:38:19,113 --> 00:38:20,321
Uh, it's in there, it's just

494
00:38:20,356 --> 00:38:21,357
kind of twisted around.

495
00:38:39,927 --> 00:38:45,208
Uh... Uh... Earl said that he
wants 15 apiece.

496
00:38:48,211 --> 00:38:49,937
Next time.

497
00:38:52,733 --> 00:38:56,219
So what he say?

498
00:38:58,497 --> 00:39:03,261
I guess that means no.

499
00:39:03,295 --> 00:39:04,780
All right, let's get the hell

500
00:39:04,814 --> 00:39:07,230
out of here.

501
00:39:12,477 --> 00:39:13,823
You're out of a job,

502
00:39:13,858 --> 00:39:14,873
we ain't never gonna get that

503
00:39:14,893 --> 00:39:16,205
double-wide you promised me.

504
00:39:17,413 --> 00:39:20,658
Let's go, Bucky.

505
00:39:28,804 --> 00:39:30,046
Man, he's got this big-ass box

506
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:31,323
of cereal, man, one of these

507
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:35,776
economy five-pound jobs, right?

508
00:39:35,811 --> 00:39:37,019
So he's gonna haul it back to

509
00:39:37,053 --> 00:39:38,241
the fuckin' store where he got

510
00:39:38,261 --> 00:39:40,401
it, and he takes it in and goes

511
00:39:40,436 --> 00:39:41,817
up to the counter and sees

512
00:39:41,851 --> 00:39:43,473
the clerk, and the guy looks in

513
00:39:43,508 --> 00:39:45,821
the box and he says, "well, how

514
00:39:45,855 --> 00:39:47,098
do I know you didn't put them

515
00:39:47,132 --> 00:39:48,237
pack of gnats in there

516
00:39:48,271 --> 00:39:49,410
yourself?"

517
00:39:57,418 --> 00:40:01,043
She wasn't but a kid, Earl.

518
00:40:05,944 --> 00:40:08,015
I mean... Maybe we should've

519
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,223
never put her in that pit.

520
00:40:09,258 --> 00:40:10,397
It's eatin' at me, man.

521
00:40:10,431 --> 00:40:12,882
It's like it's crawlin' under
my skin or somethin'.

522
00:40:12,917 --> 00:40:13,883
Well, what the fuck, do you

523
00:40:13,918 --> 00:40:17,128
think I'm made out of wood?

524
00:40:17,162 --> 00:40:18,750
I mean, what do you want me to

525
00:40:18,785 --> 00:40:19,820
say, Bucky?

526
00:40:19,855 --> 00:40:20,545
It's done.

527
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:21,857
It ain't right what we did,

528
00:40:21,891 --> 00:40:22,581
Earl.

529
00:40:22,616 --> 00:40:23,548
I just keep wondering what it

530
00:40:23,582 --> 00:40:24,929
must be like for her out in

531
00:40:24,963 --> 00:40:25,861
that pit.

532
00:40:25,895 --> 00:40:27,759
Listen to me, Bucky.

533
00:40:27,794 --> 00:40:30,382
Dead is dead, and that's all.

534
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:32,074
It don't make a rat's ass

535
00:40:32,108 --> 00:40:34,145
difference if she's a chicken or

536
00:40:34,179 --> 00:40:34,870
a goose.

537
00:40:34,904 --> 00:40:35,802
It does too.

538
00:40:35,836 --> 00:40:36,768
Goddamn it!

539
00:40:36,803 --> 00:40:38,183
Do you want people to find out

540
00:40:38,218 --> 00:40:39,771
that we put a dead girl in

541
00:40:39,806 --> 00:40:42,878
that pit?

542
00:40:47,952 --> 00:40:50,989
Shit.

543
00:41:38,347 --> 00:41:39,555
What the fuck you think you

544
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:41,384
doing?

545
00:41:41,419 --> 00:41:44,836
Are you trying to kill us both?

546
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:07,617
I'll show you all the

547
00:42:07,652 --> 00:42:11,000
hot spots.

548
00:42:17,213 --> 00:42:19,664
What's wrong?

549
00:42:19,698 --> 00:42:25,946
You didn't finish.

550
00:42:25,981 --> 00:42:26,996
You want to tell me what's

551
00:42:27,016 --> 00:42:30,364
wrong?

552
00:42:30,399 --> 00:42:31,400
I just didn't finish,

553
00:42:31,434 --> 00:42:37,164
that's all.

554
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:39,063
You finding me less

555
00:42:39,097 --> 00:42:40,996
attractive now that I'm talking

556
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:43,964
like a mother?

557
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:49,590
Oh, of course not, baby.

558
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:54,043
I'm just tired, that's all.

559
00:42:54,078 --> 00:42:54,941
Earl's plan's wearing

560
00:42:54,975 --> 00:42:57,150
you out.

561
00:42:57,184 --> 00:43:00,049
Yeah.

562
00:43:00,084 --> 00:43:06,987
And we're going again tonight.

563
00:43:07,022 --> 00:43:08,402
It's all right.

564
00:43:08,437 --> 00:43:09,921
We'll make up for it tomorrow

565
00:43:09,956 --> 00:43:14,926
night.

566
00:43:28,388 --> 00:43:30,424
After tonight, we never

567
00:43:30,459 --> 00:43:34,670
tell nobody about this, you hear me?

568
00:43:34,704 --> 00:43:36,672
I mean nobody.

569
00:44:21,648 --> 00:44:23,098
Shit.

570
00:44:43,463 --> 00:44:44,705
Hey, what are you doing

571
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,155
in there, sleeping?

572
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:47,639
No, just finishing up.

573
00:44:47,674 --> 00:44:49,055
Well, I thought I'd bring you

574
00:44:49,089 --> 00:44:50,312
your check out, save you all the

575
00:44:50,332 --> 00:44:51,643
trip.

576
00:44:51,678 --> 00:44:55,095
Thank you.

577
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,166
So, uh...

578
00:44:57,201 --> 00:44:58,616
This new truck situation, you

579
00:44:58,650 --> 00:44:59,617
guys given that any more

580
00:44:59,651 --> 00:45:03,448
thought?

581
00:45:03,483 --> 00:45:04,622
Well, Paul, I ain't heard

582
00:45:04,656 --> 00:45:06,106
nothing from the county, and

583
00:45:06,141 --> 00:45:08,143
until I do, I guess it's

584
00:45:08,177 --> 00:45:10,145
business as usual.

585
00:45:10,179 --> 00:45:13,079
Ain't that right, Bucky?

586
00:45:19,775 --> 00:45:21,328
Jesus christ.

587
00:45:32,512 --> 00:45:33,685
Looks like a big old damn

588
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,446
crockpot, doesn't it?

589
00:45:38,276 --> 00:45:39,657
Well, see you boys later.

590
00:46:11,792 --> 00:46:15,141
Bucky...

591
00:46:15,175 --> 00:46:18,213
Bucky!

592
00:46:18,247 --> 00:46:23,183
What's this?

593
00:46:23,218 --> 00:46:24,391
Uh, it's something I got at

594
00:46:24,426 --> 00:46:25,461
work.

595
00:46:25,496 --> 00:46:28,292
It was on the side of the road.

596
00:46:28,326 --> 00:46:29,480
Well, what are you planning

597
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,778
on doing with it?

598
00:46:31,812 --> 00:46:32,882
I thought of giving it

599
00:46:32,917 --> 00:46:34,367
to you.

600
00:46:34,401 --> 00:46:36,265
What would I do with just one

601
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,715
earring?

602
00:46:37,749 --> 00:46:39,165
Yeah, I don't know what I was

603
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:42,237
thinking, um...

604
00:46:42,271 --> 00:46:43,321
You know, maybe I'll just give

605
00:46:43,341 --> 00:46:44,549
it to Earl or somebody because

606
00:46:44,584 --> 00:46:46,172
he's got all those kind of weird

607
00:46:46,206 --> 00:46:48,726
girlfriends and stuff.

608
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:00,738
Forgive me father, for I have

609
00:47:00,772 --> 00:47:02,326
sinned.

610
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,742
It's been two years...

611
00:47:04,776 --> 00:47:06,261
2-1/2 years since my last

612
00:47:06,295 --> 00:47:08,159
confession.

613
00:47:08,194 --> 00:47:10,748
Father... Well, first of all,

614
00:47:10,782 --> 00:47:11,901
I've used the lord's name in vain.

615
00:47:11,921 --> 00:47:14,234
Yes.

616
00:47:14,269 --> 00:47:18,756
And I also have been less
than honest with my loving wife.

617
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:19,840
Are you having an affair,

618
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,552
my son?

619
00:47:22,691 --> 00:47:23,933
No, father.

620
00:47:23,968 --> 00:47:25,797
I've just been less than

621
00:47:25,832 --> 00:47:26,882
completely up-front with her

622
00:47:26,902 --> 00:47:27,903
about everything.

623
00:47:27,937 --> 00:47:29,698
Well, that's not good.

624
00:47:29,732 --> 00:47:31,562
I just want to confess all

625
00:47:31,596 --> 00:47:32,770
those sins and any other sins

626
00:47:32,804 --> 00:47:33,992
that I may have forgotten about

627
00:47:34,012 --> 00:47:35,324
up to this point.

628
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:36,394
Hmm.

629
00:47:36,429 --> 00:47:39,777
And... And that's all.

630
00:47:39,811 --> 00:47:42,469
That's it?

631
00:47:42,504 --> 00:47:43,953
You know you can tell me, son,

632
00:47:43,988 --> 00:47:46,197
that's what I'm here for.

633
00:47:46,232 --> 00:47:48,544
Living with sin is like living

634
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:51,202
with the devil.

635
00:47:51,237 --> 00:47:52,962
You don't want to live with the

636
00:47:52,997 --> 00:47:54,688
devil now, do you, son?

637
00:47:54,723 --> 00:47:56,483
No, father, I don't.

638
00:47:56,518 --> 00:47:57,450
All right.

639
00:47:57,484 --> 00:48:00,004
Say five hail Mary's and read

640
00:48:00,038 --> 00:48:01,281
psalm 52.

641
00:48:01,316 --> 00:48:02,524
In the name of the father, the

642
00:48:02,558 --> 00:48:04,802
son and the holy spirit, amen.

643
00:48:04,836 --> 00:48:06,355
Thanks be to God.

644
00:48:10,463 --> 00:48:12,258
Father, would it be O.K. If I

645
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:13,776
asked you a question?

646
00:48:13,811 --> 00:48:16,434
Shoot.

647
00:48:16,469 --> 00:48:17,573
Well, if someone did

648
00:48:17,608 --> 00:48:19,334
something and then someone else

649
00:48:19,368 --> 00:48:20,852
did something else to protect

650
00:48:20,887 --> 00:48:23,476
that person, then would it be a

651
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:24,891
sin to then go...

652
00:48:27,997 --> 00:48:29,378
Damn flies.

653
00:48:29,413 --> 00:48:31,932
I'm sorry, you were saying...?

654
00:48:31,967 --> 00:48:34,383
It's nothing, all right?

655
00:48:34,418 --> 00:48:35,433
Don't worry about it, it's

656
00:48:35,453 --> 00:48:36,592
nothing.

657
00:48:36,627 --> 00:48:37,628
You better make that 10

658
00:48:37,662 --> 00:48:39,423
hail Mary's.

659
00:48:52,298 --> 00:48:54,610
No, no, you keep it, Bucky.

660
00:48:54,645 --> 00:48:55,301
What for?

661
00:48:55,335 --> 00:48:56,888
I want you and Becky to go

662
00:48:56,923 --> 00:48:58,442
down to George's tonight, get

663
00:48:58,476 --> 00:48:59,684
you a couple of chicken fried

664
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:01,721
steaks and margaritas.

665
00:49:01,755 --> 00:49:02,791
It's all right.

666
00:49:02,825 --> 00:49:04,862
I'm serious, Bucky.

667
00:49:04,896 --> 00:49:06,898
Look, I figure we'll take

668
00:49:06,933 --> 00:49:08,417
tonight off and then we'll

669
00:49:08,452 --> 00:49:10,419
hit it again tomorrow.

670
00:49:10,454 --> 00:49:11,524
Come on, partner.

671
00:49:11,558 --> 00:49:12,801
You could use a little break,

672
00:49:12,835 --> 00:49:15,424
man.

673
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:44,108
Hello.

674
00:49:44,142 --> 00:49:45,420
Hey, Becky.

675
00:49:45,454 --> 00:49:46,642
Sounds like you had one too many

676
00:49:46,662 --> 00:49:47,870
margaritas.

677
00:49:47,905 --> 00:49:48,595
Earl?

678
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:49,838
Yeah, let me talk to Bucky.

679
00:49:49,872 --> 00:49:51,460
I want to see if our boy finally

680
00:49:51,495 --> 00:49:52,703
relaxed and had a little bit

681
00:49:52,737 --> 00:49:53,428
of fun.

682
00:49:53,462 --> 00:49:54,394
What are you talking about,

683
00:49:54,429 --> 00:49:55,361
Earl?

684
00:49:55,395 --> 00:49:57,397
He ain't even home yet.

685
00:49:57,432 --> 00:49:58,640
I thought he was with you.

686
00:49:58,674 --> 00:50:01,608
Uh... Yeah, he was but he

687
00:50:01,643 --> 00:50:03,023
just left and said he was gonna

688
00:50:03,058 --> 00:50:06,475
stop and pick up some margaritas

689
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:11,031
and food and shit.

690
00:50:11,066 --> 00:50:12,447
Good night, Earl.

691
00:51:44,573 --> 00:51:48,543
Get your ass out of bed!

692
00:51:58,967 --> 00:51:59,830
Chester?

693
00:51:59,864 --> 00:52:01,901
What are you doing out here, click?

694
00:52:01,935 --> 00:52:04,559
Are you workin' that graveyard shift?

695
00:52:04,593 --> 00:52:05,870
Graveyard?

696
00:52:05,905 --> 00:52:09,529
Becky told me all about it,
you know, you're out here alone.

697
00:52:09,564 --> 00:52:10,910
Where is old Earl?

698
00:52:16,847 --> 00:52:18,055
What are you doing out here,

699
00:52:18,089 --> 00:52:19,263
Chester?

700
00:52:19,297 --> 00:52:19,919
I don't know.

701
00:52:19,953 --> 00:52:20,989
Lannie called me and said

702
00:52:21,023 --> 00:52:25,234
somebody ridin' around in
one of his pastures.

703
00:52:25,269 --> 00:52:27,478
Really?

704
00:52:27,513 --> 00:52:28,790
Yeah.

705
00:52:28,824 --> 00:52:32,172
I'll probably give it a quick
look... It's an election year.

706
00:52:33,553 --> 00:52:35,175
I'll see you later, click.

707
00:52:49,189 --> 00:52:52,917
Did it go all right with you and Earl?

708
00:52:52,952 --> 00:52:53,952
Yeah, yes.

709
00:52:58,854 --> 00:53:03,652
I know what you did tonight.

710
00:53:03,687 --> 00:53:05,654
I want to know what she looks like.

711
00:53:10,659 --> 00:53:14,007
I bet she ain't nothin' but skin
and bones, right?

712
00:53:14,042 --> 00:53:16,216
I know you would've never
met her if it weren't for

713
00:53:16,251 --> 00:53:18,771
Earl Boggs.

714
00:53:18,805 --> 00:53:22,913
Well, if this marriage means
anything to you, you will settle

715
00:53:22,947 --> 00:53:25,571
this thing once and for all.

716
00:53:25,605 --> 00:53:26,882
Tomorrow before you come home,

717
00:53:26,917 --> 00:53:30,714
I want you to go to her and I
want you to tell her that it's

718
00:53:30,748 --> 00:53:34,683
over, that it was a mistake, and
you can't ever see her again.

719
00:53:39,067 --> 00:53:42,173
Honey, it's not what you think.

720
00:53:42,208 --> 00:53:47,178
You best go sleep on the couch.

721
00:53:47,213 --> 00:53:50,181
And in Ezekiel it says, "the
son shall not bear the iniquity

722
00:53:50,216 --> 00:53:51,873
of the Father."

723
00:53:51,907 --> 00:53:53,184
And what this is saying, my

724
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:54,634
friends, is that we are born

725
00:53:54,669 --> 00:53:57,913
with a clean soul, a fresh light.

726
00:53:57,948 --> 00:54:02,090
The sins of those that came
before us are not our burden.

727
00:54:02,124 --> 00:54:03,816
We carve out our own destiny...

728
00:54:05,714 --> 00:54:06,799
Live a life of goodness without

729
00:54:06,819 --> 00:54:11,340
sin, as an example for those
that come after us.

730
00:54:19,694 --> 00:54:23,732
So how was George's last night?

731
00:54:23,767 --> 00:54:26,735
It was fine.

732
00:54:32,016 --> 00:54:35,295
Did Becky enjoy herself?

733
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:36,642
She did, I guess.

734
00:54:36,676 --> 00:54:38,195
You guess?

735
00:54:38,229 --> 00:54:39,279
Well, hell, you should know,

736
00:54:39,299 --> 00:54:42,613
Bucky, you were there, weren't you?

737
00:54:42,648 --> 00:54:44,201
She had a great time.

738
00:54:44,235 --> 00:54:46,755
And you're a goddamn liar.

739
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:48,999
I called your house last night about 11:00.

740
00:54:49,033 --> 00:54:51,657
She tells me you ain't home from work yet.

741
00:54:51,691 --> 00:54:53,900
So where were you, Bucky?

742
00:54:53,935 --> 00:54:55,661
I just needed some time alone.

743
00:54:55,695 --> 00:54:58,905
What, are you getting
a piece of ass on the side?

744
00:54:58,940 --> 00:54:59,872
Oh, no, Earl.

745
00:54:59,906 --> 00:55:02,322
Not everybody's like you, O.K.?

746
00:55:02,357 --> 00:55:05,705
I just need some time by myself,
sort some of these things out.

747
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:08,812
Just what kind of things are
you sortin' out, Bucky?

748
00:55:08,846 --> 00:55:13,092
Things like why you got us
coverin' up a murder here, Earl.

749
00:55:13,126 --> 00:55:14,956
I mean, doggone it, Earl,
it's not too late.

750
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:15,991
We can still fix this.

751
00:55:16,026 --> 00:55:18,028
We go down to the sheriff right
now we can...

752
00:55:18,062 --> 00:55:19,995
Just stop it right there, Bucky.

753
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:22,688
We ain't goin' to nobody,
especially the sheriff.

754
00:55:22,722 --> 00:55:24,828
I gotta know something, Earl.

755
00:55:24,862 --> 00:55:26,795
Why are we protecting this old man, huh?

756
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:30,868
Why don't you tell me that?

757
00:55:30,903 --> 00:55:34,976
We ain't protecting Rufus.

758
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:36,460
How do we know that he didn't

759
00:55:36,494 --> 00:55:40,775
have something to do...

760
00:55:40,809 --> 00:55:42,915
With Tess?

761
00:55:42,949 --> 00:55:46,056
'cause I said so, that's why.

762
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:47,278
That ain't good enough, Earl.

763
00:55:47,298 --> 00:55:49,128
I told you he didn't do nothin'.

764
00:55:49,162 --> 00:55:49,956
Now drop it, Bucky.

765
00:55:49,991 --> 00:55:51,751
What if I don't want to drop it?

766
00:55:51,786 --> 00:55:53,733
He wouldn't have had nothin'
to do with that girl.

767
00:55:53,753 --> 00:55:54,927
Maybe I ought to go over

768
00:55:54,961 --> 00:55:56,825
there and talk to him myself right now.

769
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,137
You stay away from that place.

770
00:55:58,171 --> 00:55:59,379
Well, then he certainly

771
00:55:59,414 --> 00:56:01,865
wouldn't mind answering a few
questions, now, would he?

772
00:56:01,899 --> 00:56:05,040
You don't go near him, you understand me?

773
00:56:05,075 --> 00:56:08,112
You don't need to be steppin'
in that pile of shit.

774
00:56:26,786 --> 00:56:30,859
You got to promise me
you won't go out there.

775
00:56:30,894 --> 00:56:31,826
But Earl...

776
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:32,876
No, Bucky, you gotta promise

777
00:56:32,896 --> 00:56:38,315
me, damn it.

778
00:56:38,349 --> 00:56:41,801
O.K., all right, I promise.

779
00:57:09,139 --> 00:57:13,971
Becky boo...

780
00:57:14,006 --> 00:57:16,836
Pickle?

781
00:57:33,508 --> 00:57:35,924
Hey, Bucky.

782
00:57:35,959 --> 00:57:40,411
Hey, Chester.

783
00:57:40,446 --> 00:57:43,380
Becky here?

784
00:57:43,414 --> 00:57:45,451
Uh, no.

785
00:57:45,485 --> 00:57:46,521
No, she ain't.

786
00:57:46,555 --> 00:57:47,902
Good, come on, I'll show you

787
00:57:47,936 --> 00:57:49,904
something.

788
00:57:49,938 --> 00:57:51,388
Come on.

789
00:58:15,412 --> 00:58:18,864
What do you think?

790
00:58:33,948 --> 00:58:37,503
I don't like to brag, but...

791
00:58:37,537 --> 00:58:39,988
I outdid myself on this one.

792
00:58:42,646 --> 00:58:44,061
Could you just see her up there

793
00:58:44,096 --> 00:58:45,476
on that stage, singing her heart

794
00:58:45,511 --> 00:58:46,926
out, wearing this beauty?

795
00:58:46,961 --> 00:58:48,134
You know how much it means

796
00:58:48,169 --> 00:58:48,721
to her.

797
00:58:48,755 --> 00:58:49,964
I was gonna surprise her

798
00:58:49,998 --> 00:58:51,379
with it.

799
00:58:51,413 --> 00:58:54,278
What time she gonna be home?

800
00:58:54,313 --> 00:58:56,556
I don't know.

801
00:58:56,591 --> 00:58:59,525
Becky, uh...

802
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:02,942
She left me, I think.

803
00:59:02,977 --> 00:59:04,219
Well, hell, I'm sorry to hear

804
00:59:04,254 --> 00:59:05,980
that.

805
00:59:06,014 --> 00:59:07,099
Shoot, you know how much Elaine

806
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:08,327
and I think of y'all and

807
00:59:08,361 --> 00:59:09,224
everything.

808
00:59:09,259 --> 00:59:13,884
Hell...

809
00:59:17,577 --> 00:59:18,889
This ain't got nothin' to do

810
00:59:18,924 --> 00:59:20,649
with the little half-naked gal

811
00:59:20,684 --> 00:59:22,306
I seen you and Earl with a while

812
00:59:22,341 --> 00:59:27,898
back, does it?

813
00:59:27,933 --> 00:59:30,142
Yeah, guess I'll...

814
00:59:30,176 --> 00:59:31,384
Drop it off at her mother's

815
00:59:31,419 --> 00:59:37,632
house.

816
00:59:37,666 --> 00:59:39,013

Well, go on, do it.

It's in pain, for Christ's sakes, Bucky.

You're doing it a favor.

I can't do it.

835
01:02:25,593 --> 01:02:26,594
You fuckin' pussy.

836
01:02:26,628 --> 01:02:29,183
Give me that.

837
01:03:07,255 --> 01:03:09,499
Die, goddamn it!

01:03:20,268 --> 01:03:21,856
Don't you ever make me do your

job for you again.

840
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,204
You hear me?

841
01:03:54,958 --> 01:03:55,855
Hello.

842
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:56,822
I guess congratulations

843
01:03:56,856 --> 01:03:58,237
are in order.

844
01:03:58,272 --> 01:04:00,239
The job's yours, uh, Bucky left

845
01:04:00,274 --> 01:04:01,758
the truck out at the pit, the

846
01:04:01,792 --> 01:04:03,311
keys are in the office.

847
01:04:03,346 --> 01:04:05,417
I'll try and get you some, some

848
01:04:05,451 --> 01:04:07,350
kind of temporary help, but that

849
01:04:07,384 --> 01:04:09,248
won't happen till Monday, so you

850
01:04:09,283 --> 01:04:10,491
might have to hit the road on

851
01:04:10,525 --> 01:04:11,871
your own tomorrow, O.K.?

852
01:04:20,915 --> 01:04:26,403
We gotta talk.

853
01:04:26,438 --> 01:04:27,370
The job's yours.

854
01:04:27,404 --> 01:04:28,371
No, it ain't about the damn

855
01:04:28,405 --> 01:04:30,511
job, Bucky.

856
01:04:30,545 --> 01:04:31,443
Goddamn it!

857
01:04:31,477 --> 01:04:32,858
I ain't gonna let you just walk

858
01:04:32,892 --> 01:04:34,239
away from this mess we're in.

859
01:04:34,273 --> 01:04:38,967
It don't work that way.

860
01:04:39,002 --> 01:04:40,383
Now, I know it's been hard

861
01:04:40,417 --> 01:04:42,764
on you, man.

862
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:45,905
That girl in that pit.

863
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:48,253
And even though I'll probably

864
01:04:48,287 --> 01:04:50,841
live to regret it, I'm willing

865
01:04:50,876 --> 01:04:53,327
to go with you, Bucky.

866
01:04:53,361 --> 01:04:55,398
We'll pull her out of there and

867
01:04:55,432 --> 01:04:56,620
give her the kind of burial you

868
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,298
see fit.

869
01:05:04,821 --> 01:05:07,962
Are you listening to me, boy?

870
01:05:07,996 --> 01:05:09,412
I'm listening.

871
01:05:09,446 --> 01:05:10,462
Well, that's what you want,

872
01:05:10,482 --> 01:05:11,655
ain't it?

873
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:13,278
A proper burial and all?

874
01:05:13,312 --> 01:05:14,969
I do.

875
01:05:15,003 --> 01:05:19,456
Well, all right, then.

876
01:05:19,491 --> 01:05:20,802
Now, tonight everybody in town's

877
01:05:20,837 --> 01:05:22,287
gonna be over watching that damn

878
01:05:22,321 --> 01:05:24,012
talent show.

879
01:05:24,047 --> 01:05:25,428
You meet me in front of Bob's

880
01:05:25,462 --> 01:05:28,845
old place about 8:00, then we

881
01:05:28,879 --> 01:05:30,536
head to the pit and take care of

882
01:05:30,571 --> 01:05:32,366
business, O.K.?

883
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,746
It still leaves a killer out

884
01:05:33,781 --> 01:05:37,957
there on the loose, don't it?

885
01:05:37,992 --> 01:05:41,306
Just be there.

886
01:06:29,526 --> 01:06:33,047
Who in the hell are you?

887
01:06:33,081 --> 01:06:34,842
Bucky click.

888
01:06:34,876 --> 01:06:36,430
County carcass removal.

889
01:06:36,464 --> 01:06:38,915
Yeah...

890
01:06:38,949 --> 01:06:40,710
I'll be damned.

891
01:06:40,744 --> 01:06:41,987
Listen to me, liz, goddamn

01:06:42,021 --> 01:06:43,333

893
01:06:43,368 --> 01:06:44,023
wrong!

894
01:06:44,058 --> 01:06:45,335
All right, all right, just

895
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:47,095
simmer down.

896
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:48,925
You don't have to yell at me.

897
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:50,789
I just want to see you.

898
01:06:50,823 --> 01:06:52,377
I don't want to hear any more

899
01:06:52,411 --> 01:06:53,447
excuses...

900
01:06:53,481 --> 01:06:54,635

901
01:06:54,655 --> 01:06:56,035

01:06:56,967 --> 01:06:59,349
Yeah, I got some shit I gotta do...

904
01:06:59,384 --> 01:07:00,626
So when I finish that...

905
01:07:00,661 --> 01:07:02,835
I'll be over and pick you up, all right?

906
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:03,733
You better.

907
01:07:03,767 --> 01:07:05,838
Don't make me come lookin' for you.

908
01:07:05,873 --> 01:07:08,358
All right. Bye.

909
01:07:18,472 --> 01:07:20,853
Drink up, boy.

910
01:07:20,888 --> 01:07:23,097
It's well water.

911
01:07:23,131 --> 01:07:29,137
Ain't nothin' sweeter.

912
01:07:36,455 --> 01:07:41,564
Might we be able to open up a
window, or two?

913
01:07:41,598 --> 01:07:44,843
Oh, no, no...

914
01:07:44,877 --> 01:07:48,087
Lets flies in.

915
01:07:48,122 --> 01:07:54,611
Hideous, diseased... Creatures.

916
01:07:54,646 --> 01:07:57,407
Vermin.

917
01:08:16,046 --> 01:08:19,601
Yee-ha!

918
01:08:19,635 --> 01:08:22,052
My partner and i, we two came

919
01:08:22,087 --> 01:08:24,572
by the other night to...

920
01:08:24,607 --> 01:08:28,542
Clean out your well.

921
01:08:28,576 --> 01:08:29,474
I was kind of wondering, how

922
01:08:29,508 --> 01:08:33,235
come you called us and not the sheriff.

923
01:08:33,269 --> 01:08:34,927
You have no idea how much

924
01:08:34,962 --> 01:08:37,930
I wanted to.

925
01:08:37,965 --> 01:08:40,760
Ah, the trouble with him,

926
01:08:40,795 --> 01:08:44,868
it's always in his secrets.

927
01:08:44,903 --> 01:08:51,634
Never face the facts,
always denying the truth.

928
01:08:53,049 --> 01:08:56,189
Kept secrets from me.

929
01:08:56,224 --> 01:08:58,951
Kept secrets from you.

930
01:08:58,985 --> 01:09:01,644
You like that, boy?

931
01:09:01,678 --> 01:09:03,508
You like keeping secrets?

932
01:09:03,542 --> 01:09:04,474
No, sir, but who...?

933
01:09:04,509 --> 01:09:11,653
To deny the truth is to deny who you are.

934
01:09:11,688 --> 01:09:14,725
That's what it says in the bible.

935
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:16,590
Yes, sir.

936
01:09:16,624 --> 01:09:19,696
I always told him, never keep
from doing what you know is

937
01:09:19,731 --> 01:09:26,012
right, and hell with
what anyone else thinks.

938
01:09:26,046 --> 01:09:29,292
But he just didn't see it

939
01:09:29,326 --> 01:09:34,228
that way... Nah.

940
01:09:34,261 --> 01:09:39,646
Sir, who is "he"?

941
01:09:39,681 --> 01:09:43,617
My son.

942
01:09:43,651 --> 01:09:45,515
Earl.

943
01:10:05,984 --> 01:10:07,019
Where the fuck are you,

944
01:10:07,054 --> 01:10:08,676
Bucky?

945
01:10:08,711 --> 01:10:10,885
It is unbelievable what
he can do with a rope.

946
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,162
Katch, come on up here.

947
01:10:29,627 --> 01:10:31,596
You don't know much about

948
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:35,669
Earl Boggs, do you?

949
01:10:35,703 --> 01:10:41,606
You see, I needed to raise a boy
to some day be a man.

950
01:10:44,678 --> 01:10:47,612
A man's man.

951
01:10:50,787 --> 01:10:53,341
A man...

952
01:10:53,376 --> 01:10:57,622
Who had a clean soul.

953
01:10:57,656 --> 01:11:02,591
I almost succeeded with...

954
01:11:02,627 --> 01:11:06,631
Earl, but...

955
01:11:06,665 --> 01:11:12,015
He had too many outside influences.

956
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:18,884
Mostly tramps and whores...

957
01:11:18,919 --> 01:11:24,959
Sometimes I think Earl was just jealous.

958
01:11:24,993 --> 01:11:30,171
He had no idea what I needed.

959
01:11:30,206 --> 01:11:37,109
More importantly, he had
no idea what you needed.

960
01:11:37,144 --> 01:11:38,835
Huh, what he knew

961
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:42,701
what I needed?

962
01:11:50,813 --> 01:11:55,162
Get!

963
01:11:55,196 --> 01:11:58,198
Help me!

964
01:11:58,234 --> 01:12:00,685
Don't leave me like this.

965
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:03,791
Help me, help me.

966
01:12:11,247 --> 01:12:13,836
You listen to me, boy.

967
01:12:13,870 --> 01:12:16,321
You listen good.

968
01:12:16,355 --> 01:12:20,221
Earl lied to you.

969
01:12:20,256 --> 01:12:22,671
Earl was a child...

970
01:12:22,707 --> 01:12:25,675
He had all this hatred runnin'

971
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:28,850
through his arteries.

972
01:12:28,885 --> 01:12:35,374
It was my duty to cleanse his soul.

973
01:12:35,409 --> 01:12:37,722
It wasn't easy.

974
01:12:37,756 --> 01:12:39,827
Didn't take to it at first,

975
01:12:39,862 --> 01:12:47,421
and then he saw the path, he
realized it was good for him.

976
01:12:47,455 --> 01:12:50,216
Then you came into the picture.

977
01:12:50,251 --> 01:12:52,702
You distracted him.

978
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:58,009
Earl, we gotta talk.

979
01:13:58,043 --> 01:14:01,184
We need to talk now, O.K.?

980
01:14:01,219 --> 01:14:03,911
So talk, Bucky.

981
01:14:03,946 --> 01:14:08,019
I spoke with Rufus today.

982
01:14:08,053 --> 01:14:10,193
I told you never go out there.

983
01:14:10,228 --> 01:14:11,816
I had to Earl, I had to

984
01:14:11,850 --> 01:14:12,402
find out...

985
01:14:12,437 --> 01:14:13,265
What the fuck did he

986
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:13,921
tell you?

987
01:14:13,956 --> 01:14:14,646
It doesn't matter, O.K.?

988
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,372
What matters is the two of us

989
01:14:16,406 --> 01:14:17,822
going down to sheriff and

990
01:14:17,856 --> 01:14:18,941
straighten things out 'cause I

991
01:14:18,961 --> 01:14:20,169
can't live with what I done.

992
01:14:20,203 --> 01:14:21,204
I can't!

993
01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:22,412
Look, I done a lot of

994
01:14:22,447 --> 01:14:23,930
fucked up things in my life.

995
01:14:23,966 --> 01:14:26,831
I am a fuck-up, but I never

996
01:14:26,865 --> 01:14:28,142
killed nobody!

997
01:14:28,177 --> 01:14:29,385
Goddamn it!

998
01:14:29,419 --> 01:14:32,008
My business is my business!

999
01:14:32,043 --> 01:14:34,252
I told you stay away from Rufus!

1000
01:14:36,392 --> 01:14:37,911
I understand, Earl, but I

1001
01:14:37,945 --> 01:14:38,961
just want my life back, like

1002
01:14:38,981 --> 01:14:40,361
the way it was before we found

1003
01:14:40,396 --> 01:14:41,397
that girl.

1004
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:42,881
But you're flat-out wrong asking

1005
01:14:42,916 --> 01:14:44,434
a man to throw away everything...

1006
01:14:44,469 --> 01:14:46,264

whatever it is you're hiding.

1008
01:14:48,368 --> 01:14:49,923
Now, I'll come by first thing in

1009
01:14:49,957 --> 01:14:50,973
the morning, Earl, and we'll go

1010

01:26:45,707 --> 01:26:48,848
You never told me.

1098
01:26:48,882 --> 01:26:50,296
I told her I'd take good care

1099
01:26:50,332 --> 01:26:53,887
of you.

1100
01:26:53,921 --> 01:26:55,130
It wasn't long before I was

1101
01:26:55,164 --> 01:26:58,651
passed out, drunk.

1102
01:26:58,685 --> 01:27:02,309
When I woke up, I heard Rufus

1103
01:27:02,344 --> 01:27:05,968
in there, prayin'.

1104
01:27:06,002 --> 01:27:07,245
And I knew that goddamn prayer

1105
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,350
by heart.

1106
01:27:12,596 --> 01:27:13,907
I about begged him to open the

1107
01:27:13,942 --> 01:27:16,013
door.

1108
01:27:16,046 --> 01:27:18,602
I begged him, but he just kept

1109
01:27:18,635 --> 01:27:24,573
praying.

1110
01:27:24,608 --> 01:27:25,623
Let the water, the

1111
01:27:25,643 --> 01:27:30,855
blood, cleanse you...

1112
01:27:30,890 --> 01:27:32,098
I could hear you in there,

1113
01:27:32,132 --> 01:27:33,617
Bucky, you were just, you were

1114
01:27:33,651 --> 01:27:35,100
just splashin' around, you was

1115
01:27:35,135 --> 01:27:37,068
laughin' like nothin' was wrong.

1116
01:27:46,802 --> 01:27:51,600
And then it got real quiet.

1117
01:27:51,635 --> 01:27:55,224
Then you...

1118
01:27:55,259 --> 01:27:56,398
Then you started screamin'.

1119
01:27:56,432 --> 01:27:57,606
I tried to break the goddamn

1120
01:27:57,641 --> 01:27:58,711
door, Bucky.

1121
01:27:58,745 --> 01:28:00,747
[thudding on door,

1122
01:28:19,317 --> 01:28:20,767
I tried to kick the goddamn

1123
01:28:20,802 --> 01:28:24,046
door in!

1124
01:28:29,189 --> 01:28:35,748
It was too late, man.

1125
01:28:41,305 --> 01:28:42,996
It was my fault, it was my

1126
01:28:43,031 --> 01:28:44,066
fault.

1127
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:45,653
I let her down, I let your

1128
01:28:45,689 --> 01:28:50,037
mama down, I let you down.

1129
01:28:50,072 --> 01:28:52,972
It was my fault.

1130
01:28:53,006 --> 01:28:54,662
My mama knew what happened

1131
01:28:54,698 --> 01:28:57,734
to me?

1132
01:29:04,846 --> 01:29:08,159
She never saw you again.

1133
01:29:11,473 --> 01:29:12,785
You promised me you wouldn't go

1134
01:29:12,819 --> 01:29:16,028
out there, Bucky!

1135
01:29:16,064 --> 01:29:17,652
Why'd you go out there?

1136
01:29:35,323 --> 01:29:39,743
Get on out.

1137
01:29:39,777 --> 01:29:42,884
Get on down.

1138
01:29:42,918 --> 01:29:46,025
What are you doin', Earl?

1139
01:29:46,059 --> 01:29:47,213
I'm doin' what I'm supposed

1140
01:29:47,233 --> 01:29:48,890
to be doin'.

1141
01:29:48,924 --> 01:29:51,858
I'm takin' care of Bucky click.

1142
01:29:51,893 --> 01:29:54,343
Earl, how come you never told

1143
01:29:54,377 --> 01:29:55,724
me about what Rufus done and

1144
01:29:55,759 --> 01:29:56,414
all that?

1145
01:29:56,448 --> 01:29:57,464
Because you ain't got the

1146
01:29:57,484 --> 01:29:59,383
goddamn constitution to handle

1147
01:29:59,417 --> 01:30:00,867
something like that.

1148
01:30:00,902 --> 01:30:02,109
How come you didn't ever do

1149
01:30:02,144 --> 01:30:03,352
something?

1150
01:30:03,387 --> 01:30:05,078
You know, report him, or...

1151
01:30:05,113 --> 01:30:08,046
It ain't that goddamn easy.

1152
01:30:08,081 --> 01:30:10,463
We talkin' about family.

1153
01:30:10,497 --> 01:30:11,775
I spent my whole goddamn

1154
01:30:11,809 --> 01:30:13,224
childhood runnin' and hidin'

1155
01:30:13,259 --> 01:30:15,364
from Rufus, just hopin' he'd be

1156
01:30:15,399 --> 01:30:18,298
too drunk to find me.

1157
01:30:18,332 --> 01:30:20,542
And some days I was lucky,

1158
01:30:20,576 --> 01:30:21,957
and other days he got what he

1159
01:30:21,992 --> 01:30:25,028
wanted.

1160
01:30:25,064 --> 01:30:26,030
You should've never gone up

1161
01:30:26,064 --> 01:30:27,080
there, you promised me you

1162
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:30,034
wouldn't go.

1163
01:30:30,069 --> 01:30:31,864
And now that you know the truth,

1164
01:30:31,898 --> 01:30:32,914
there ain't no goddamn way I'm

1165
01:30:32,934 --> 01:30:34,555
gonna let you live your life

1166
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:35,937
with the same kind of pain that

1167
01:30:35,971 --> 01:30:37,385
I live mine.

1168
01:30:37,421 --> 01:30:40,769
So turn around.

1169
01:30:40,804 --> 01:30:42,426
Earl, you can't do this.

1170
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:44,841
I said turn around, Bucky.

1171
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:55,577
I should've never left you alone

1172
01:30:55,611 --> 01:30:57,406
with him, buck.

1173
01:30:57,441 --> 01:30:58,925
I'm sorry, Bucky, you gotta

1174
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,271
believe me.

1175
01:31:00,305 --> 01:31:01,548
I do believe you, Earl.

1176
01:31:01,582 --> 01:31:02,929
I just want things back the way

1177
01:31:02,964 --> 01:31:04,412
it used to be.

1178
01:31:04,448 --> 01:31:05,414
You know, me drivin', you

1179
01:31:05,448 --> 01:31:06,899
ridin', the two of us takin'

1180
01:31:06,933 --> 01:31:07,831
care of business.

1181
01:31:07,865 --> 01:31:09,798
I know, Bucky, I know.

1182
01:31:09,832 --> 01:31:11,835
But it can't be that way.

1183
01:31:11,868 --> 01:31:13,284
It's over.

1184
01:31:13,319 --> 01:31:18,151
Don't look at me!

1185
01:31:18,186 --> 01:31:19,981
Here, put this over your head.

1186
01:31:20,015 --> 01:31:21,948
Put it over your head!

1187
01:31:21,983 --> 01:31:23,171
See, I promised your mama that

1188
01:31:23,191 --> 01:31:25,193
I'd take care of you, and I

1189
01:31:25,227 --> 01:31:26,608
can't let her down again like I

1190
01:31:26,642 --> 01:31:28,368
did that day.

1191
01:31:37,205 --> 01:31:38,862
Earl?

1192
01:31:38,896 --> 01:31:41,899
Yeah.

1193
01:31:41,934 --> 01:31:44,937
I gotta know something.

1194
01:31:44,971 --> 01:31:49,251
Are you my father?

1195
01:31:49,286 --> 01:31:50,839
I hoped I'd never cut out to

1196
01:31:50,874 --> 01:31:52,185
be no daddy.

1197
01:32:17,901 --> 01:32:23,009
Earl?

1198
01:32:30,568 --> 01:32:31,880
Oh, Earl!

1199
01:32:31,915 --> 01:32:33,986
God, no, Earl!

1200
01:32:34,019 --> 01:32:39,612
Oh, no!

1201
01:32:39,646 --> 01:32:41,475
Earl...

1202
01:32:45,341 --> 01:32:46,964
I don't know how long it was

1203
01:32:46,999 --> 01:32:48,207
before I finally called the

1204
01:32:48,241 --> 01:32:52,555
sheriff... And I explained to
him as best I could about

1205
01:32:52,590 --> 01:32:59,045
everything, even Tess, like I
should've done a long time ago.

1206
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:06,121
At least now she'll get a
proper burial and be at peace.

1207
01:33:06,156 --> 01:33:07,398
There's a lot of things I

1208
01:33:07,433 --> 01:33:11,609
didn't know about Earl, but
deep down I know he didn't kill

1209
01:33:11,644 --> 01:33:16,683
that poor girl.

1210
01:33:16,718 --> 01:33:20,964
With a new job, Becky got just
about all she ever wanted,

1211
01:33:20,998 --> 01:33:22,689
except for one thing.

1212
01:33:22,724 --> 01:33:23,808
So we decided to petition the

1213
01:33:23,828 --> 01:33:28,661
county and give a home to
little Jimmy McClinton.

1214
01:33:28,695 --> 01:33:30,490
At least this way his childhood

1215
01:33:30,525 --> 01:33:34,115
will be better than mine.

1216
01:33:40,121 --> 01:33:41,260
You know, Earl always said,

1217
01:33:41,294 --> 01:33:43,124
"dead is dead."

1218
01:33:43,158 --> 01:33:46,334
But I know now that's not true.

1219
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:48,336
Some days I can feel him with

1220
01:33:48,370 --> 01:33:51,063
me, just like it used to be...

1221
01:33:51,097 --> 01:33:55,999
Me drivin', Earl ridin'...

1222
01:33:56,033 --> 01:33:57,552
Takin' care of business.

1223
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:11,117
And even though it can't ever
be that way again, I'm sure

1224
01:34:11,152 --> 01:34:14,258
everything will be just right.
