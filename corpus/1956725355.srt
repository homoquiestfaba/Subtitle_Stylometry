No thank you, Tamar.

We are fasting.

581
01:18:37,101 --> 01:18:40,605
Tomorrow, we wives

Selah, only the Shepherd
can tell the stories.

612
01:25:13,665 --> 01:25:16,464
There once was a woman.

613
01:25:16,466 --> 01:25:18,701
A wild woman.

614
01:25:18,703 --> 01:25:22,038
Made of moonlight and teeth.

615
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:25,507
And sometimes,
she would roam in the woods

616
01:25:25,509 --> 01:25:28,077
searching for something.

617
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:29,113

619
01:25:33,417 --> 01:25:37,019
<i>and the water
would speak to her.</i>

620
01:25:37,021 --> 01:25:40,255
<i>Talk to her and tell her tales.</i>

621

<i>There has been a miracle.</i>

627
01:27:03,608 --> 01:27:06,942
The sacred lake of rebirth

628
01:27:06,944 --> 01:27:10,681
has given the wives
the grace of eternal life.

629
01:27:13,184 --> 01:27:15,787

Daughters, this was the path
I had to take..

636
01:27:49,486 --> 01:27:52,790
...for you sisters
to become the wives.

637

I will take you
in my arms, Selah

642
01:28:16,948 --> 01:28:19,416

01:28:28,826 --> 01:28:30,328
Come here.

644
01:28:36,834 --> 01:28:39,036
I'll give you my grace.

645
01:28:45,977 --> 01:28:49,046
You are not our shepherd.
