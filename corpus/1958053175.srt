We haven't seen you in forever.

00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,060
would be to run me
over at 9 A.M.?

17

61
00:05:15,543 --> 00:05:17,024

62
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,110
this game called "The Game"

63
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,071

64
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,031

241
00:13:51,842 --> 00:13:53,373

242
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,167
you were in rehab,
so you started with yourself

243
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:58,587

What do you make of me?
Is my life on the skids?

260
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,334
I give her a fake name.

261
00:14:48,377 --> 00:14:50,597
It doesn't matter.
I still look through the phone book

262
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,973
and there's the fake name.

263
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:53,815
And I just see that,
and I just wanna call that.

264
00:14:54,191 --> 00:14:57,020
What name did you give her?
- What's the point what name I gave her?

265
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,104
It makes no difference.

266
00:14:58,146 --> 00:15:00,398
Tell me.
- Mildred.

267
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,398
I'd get my guitar out
and start jamming,

268
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,781
practicing, good stuff.

269
00:15:08,823 --> 00:15:11,284

270
00:15:11,326 --> 00:15:12,577

271
00:15:12,952 --> 00:15:15,497

and hear it, you know?

272
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:17,624
I don't know.

273
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,627

her out or something,

274

275
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,091

Did you hear how crazy she got?

534
00:29:25,762 --> 00:29:27,972
That just proves that
she didn't steal it. Right?

535
00:29:28,014 --> 00:29:29,682
And how can you think she's boring?

536
00:29:29,724 --> 00:29:30,767
She is boring.

537
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:35,021
We were having a great
talk until you got involved.

538
00:29:35,063 --> 00:29:38,107
Well, look, that just
proves my theory then

539
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:39,817
that people that are non-boring,

540
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:42,695
AKA "suspicious people"

541
00:29:42,737 --> 00:29:44,155
didn't take your computer.

542
00:29:46,783 --> 00:29:47,783
Hey!

543
00:29:48,201 --> 00:29:49,244
Good to see you, Cole!

544
00:29:49,286 --> 00:29:50,620

545
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,163
Yeah, it's weird running into you.

546

You man...
You have it made.

553
00:30:18,481 --> 00:30:20,191
Your life is like an endless party.

554
00:30:20,233 --> 00:30:21,735
Uh well, yeah...

555
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:27,448
I mean, I don't know, you know, I just

556
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:31,494
I mean, I just hustled this job
completely out of the blue.

557
00:30:31,536 --> 00:30:34,831
Yeah.
- Yeah. I just came up to this...

558
00:30:34,873 --> 00:30:38,876
lady, you know, I saw who was at this club

559
00:30:38,918 --> 00:30:42,588
and she was obviously
like way too old to be there.

560
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,799
She was there with
like three other old ladies.

561
00:30:44,841 --> 00:30:45,841
Nice.

562
00:30:46,217 --> 00:30:48,886
So I figured she must be something like

563
00:30:48,928 --> 00:30:50,638
somebody who could do something for me.

564
00:30:51,014 --> 00:30:52,849
Phony people...

565
00:30:52,891 --> 00:30:54,183
Yeah, I don't know.

566
00:30:54,225 --> 00:30:57,228
I just sorta...
it just sorta worked out, ya know?

567
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,814
That's why it was cool when
it was just us,

568
00:30:59,856 --> 00:31:01,899
you know, like, your friends.

569
00:31:01,941 --> 00:31:03,776
But it wasn't phony, really.

570
00:31:03,818 --> 00:31:05,779
Well, I mean, it was, it was...

571
00:31:06,196 --> 00:31:09,949
It was kind of like...
it just unfolded like really naturally.

572
00:31:10,408 --> 00:31:13,453
Those are like
old rich people though, man!

573
00:31:13,495 --> 00:31:16,539
It was like you and
us and your friends and stuff,

574
00:31:16,581 --> 00:31:18,082
that was cool.

575
00:31:18,124 --> 00:31:21,627
That was like the good old days,
or whatever. I don't know.

576
00:31:21,669 --> 00:31:26,549
I know it sounds so cheesy.
- I know what you're saying but,

577
00:31:26,591 --> 00:31:29,719
it was, you know, it was fine.

578
00:31:29,761 --> 00:31:32,472
She gave me a job.
Ya know...?

579
00:31:32,514 --> 00:31:34,890
That's what you gotta do, man!

580
00:31:34,932 --> 00:31:39,958
You just gotta move to
wherever you move to and just

581
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,817
you know, you'll you go out to places
and you'll meet people and you'll

582
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:49,197
make friends and then just things
will happen for you.

583
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:51,319
Know what I mean?
It'll just start happening for you.

584
00:31:52,325 --> 00:31:54,702
I don't know.

00:31:58,456 --> 00:32:02,919
It's not even... it's not that
hard, it's not a big deal. Right?

<b>Dear newspaper...</b>

618
00:34:24,644 --> 00:34:26,354

00:34:26,396 --> 00:34:30,316
if you would please help me send an e-mail

00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:34,695
to those goddamn morons at The Times.

621
00:34:36,614 --> 00:34:37,824
Sure.

622
00:34:40,201 --> 00:34:42,119
I have been reading your paper

623
00:34:42,161 --> 00:34:48,334
regularly for the last 50-some-odd years.
Almost every morning,

624
00:34:48,376 --> 00:34:52,088
browsing through pages,
I come to the same thought

625
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,799
These guys are a bunch of goddamn morons.

626
00:34:57,718 --> 00:35:02,098
All right. I'll just send it
from my e-mail, Ok?

628
00:35:04,433 --> 00:35:07,958

All right. I sent it.

634
00:35:25,913 --> 00:35:28,291

00:35:58,821 --> 00:36:03,117
one minute cold, four minutes hot,

Alright.
- Let me ask you something.

650
00:36:18,507 --> 00:36:21,010
Do you sleep with your window open?

651
00:36:22,845 --> 00:36:25,348
I don't know.

652
00:36:25,932 --> 00:36:28,768
Don't you sleep with your window open?

653
00:36:30,478 --> 00:36:32,021
You know... I'm really not sure.

654
00:36:32,063 --> 00:36:37,295
You must sleep with your window open
and don't trust women.

655
00:36:37,337 --> 00:36:39,612
Grampa!
- You're not a woman!

656
00:36:39,654 --> 00:36:44,450
Your mother was never a woman
and you'll never be a woman!

657
00:36:44,492 --> 00:36:45,993

your Romeo the facts of life.

Yeah, what are you, crazy?

661
00:36:55,503 --> 00:36:57,671
We don't let him use the computer.

662
00:36:57,713 --> 00:37:00,174
Sorry. He seemed innocent enough.

663
00:37:02,802 --> 00:37:05,429
You know what happens when you
let old people use the computer?

664
00:37:06,097 --> 00:37:08,515
It starts with innocent
grandpa sending an email,

665
00:37:08,557 --> 00:37:12,000
and it ends with psychotic mom
killing a girl on MySpace.

666
00:37:13,104 --> 00:37:15,314
I'm sorry, I didn't know your policy.

667
00:37:15,356 --> 00:37:18,401
Yeah. You don't know anything.

668
00:37:19,193 --> 00:37:21,862

669
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,216

- Yes.

Can you just please bring him to me?

683
00:37:54,057 --> 00:37:55,938
Because I have a question to ask him. Ok?

684
00:37:57,106 --> 00:37:58,958
And then you're gonna leave?

685
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Yes. Thank you.

686
00:38:10,578 --> 00:38:12,121
He's black.

687
00:38:14,456 --> 00:38:16,166

688
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:18,002

689
00:38:20,337 --> 00:38:22,297

00:38:28,429 --> 00:38:30,848
he's responsible!

Nice to meet you, I'm Edwin.

708
00:39:22,191 --> 00:39:23,484
Hey, nice to meet you.

709
00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:26,612
You had a question for him.

710
00:39:26,654 --> 00:39:28,322
Did I? Uhh...

711
00:39:28,364 --> 00:39:30,699
Yeah, you did. I went and got him

712
00:39:30,741 --> 00:39:32,826
because you wanted to ask
him something.

713
00:39:32,868 --> 00:39:36,914
I... no... I think... wha...

714
00:39:36,956 --> 00:39:39,416
probably whatever I wanted
to ask Edwin was...

715
00:39:39,917 --> 00:39:42,920
I don't know what I was thinking.
Because obviously

716
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:48,008
Edwin has nothing to do with what
I wanted to ask him about.

717
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:50,344
No, no, please, James. Go right ahead.

718
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,014
No, really, it's Ok.

719
00:39:54,056 --> 00:39:56,892
I'm all cleared up now.

720
00:39:56,934 --> 00:39:59,353
Ok. Very good. Well...

721
00:40:00,479 --> 00:40:02,648

722
00:40:03,148 --> 00:40:04,817

723
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,153

724
00:40:08,195 --> 00:40:09,696
He told you to eat crow.

725
00:40:09,738 --> 00:40:11,073
Crows are really smart.

726
00:40:11,115 --> 00:40:13,325

wanna steal their computer.

Why did you think it would be so easy?

828

But it's not so easy in L.A., is it?

832

Where no one knows you
and no one is your friend.

833
