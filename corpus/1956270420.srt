1
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,254
Fuck, you scared me, man.

2
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:36,755
"You scared me, man."

3
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:38,926
What took you so long?

4
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,389
What's with the cousin?

5
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,205
Your sister is freaking out,
she wants to leave.

6
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,221
Relax. We had trouble finding her.

7
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:00,613
Agustín. Help me!

8
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,471
What a drag.

9
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,610
Relax, bitch...

10
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:22,780
...and I cum!

11
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,522
No wonder...

12
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:29,090
...the pussy...

13
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,695
...is in the dick.

14
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,334
No wonder...

15
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:37,099
...the tits...

16
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,372
...are so milky.

17
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:41,708
One more...

18
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,507
...and I cum.

19
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:53,013
Remember when he performed
in his underwear?

20
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:54,177
I remember.

21
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
Paloma.

22
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,944
Good, so anyway...

23
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,704
Yes, we want them.

24
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,142
Are they dangerous?

25
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:00,277
Any possible complications?

26
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:08,125
Fuck. I saw this coming....

27
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:11,564
Sara has to go back for an exam.

28
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:25,812
Are you crazy?

29
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:15,854
Barbara, slow down!

30
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:18,889
Who is Melda?

31
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,120
The caretaker's wife.
We're picking her up.

32
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,077
Why don't you just call her?

33
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,506
Sir? Do you know where I can find Melda?

34
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,447
Maybe at Lorenza's.

35
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:21,647
- That one?
- Yes.

36
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:22,848
Thanks.

37
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:46,439
Are you Mapuche?

38
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:49,065
Everyone here is Mapuche, right?

39
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,210
But you speak Spanish?

40
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:53,346
Good...

41
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:08,928
How are you doing Melda?

42
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,029
Fine, Agustín.

43
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,497
Hello. I'm Brink.

44
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:12,793
Nice to meet you.

45
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:15,701
Need help?

46
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:57,667
Just leave them.

47
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,309
Melda they are going to die!

48
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,745
That's why they were abandoned.

49
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,711
Are you kidding me?

50
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,124
Fucking dog!

51
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,117
Agustín, give me the dog.

52
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:40,478
Fucking dog... mother fucker.

53
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:23,057
How are you doing?

54
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,689
Come jump on the boat. Careful.

55
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:26,298
I'll help you.

56
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,267
- Hi honey.
- Hi love.

57
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:59,227
Is there a soccer team in this
town Mr. Bernardo?

58
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,299
Yeah!

59
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,052
What happened!?

60
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,483
Relax, Barbara...

61
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,522
Is this the only house around here?

62
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:31,187
No, there's also my cousin's...

63
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:04,190
I'm realistic.
You act so eco-friendly and shit...

64
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:06,723
You knew you'd end up
throwing that fucking dog away.

65
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,727
What was your plan, what was your plan?

66
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:45,789
In the United States...

67
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:22,935
Does this shit work?

68
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:25,996
Is there ammunition?

69
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:08,071
Shut up!

70
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:36,575
Good night.

71
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:52,891
So boring!

72
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,071
C'mon man.

73
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:49,963
Melda, yeah, one loaf a day is fine.

74
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,765
Slave!

75
00:22:52,005 --> 00:22:53,598
Where is my breakfast!

76
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:02,973
Breakfast!

77
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,783
Agustín, your dick! Gross!

78
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:26,672
Sit down, girlfriend.

79
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:12,942
He doesn't understand a thing.

80
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:33,058
You failed, my friend.

81
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:34,132
Mother fucker!

82
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,125
C'mon!

83
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:36,225
C'mon!

84
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:37,702
Are we playing or what?

85
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:44,609
I dare you.

86
00:30:55,955 --> 00:30:57,014
I'm gonna get you!

87
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:20,845
Get out! Out!

88
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:55,774
It's fucking freezing out.

89
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:56,294
Fuck!

90
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:19,043
I'm that dog.

91
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:26,912
I'm that dog.

92
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:31,125
You know she's shy and weird.
And you know she's alone.

93
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:33,497
Apologize, man.
Sara is gonna be pissed.

94
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:37,972
I think she was abused as a child or
she's a lesbian or something.

95
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:39,536
You're the lesbian, man.

96
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,928
Miss Barbara, miss Barbara, do you copy?

97
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:38,960
Miss Barbara...

98
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,505
What's going on Bernardo? Over.

99
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:46,273
Good morning. Miss Sara just arrived,
we are crossing the lake, over.

100
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:21,738
Nice to meet you.

101
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:23,302
Hey beautiful!

102
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:28,410
Thank you.

103
00:42:36,955 --> 00:42:37,995
How do you like my gringa?

104
00:42:45,931 --> 00:42:46,931
Thanks Bernardo.

105
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:10,882
What's with those rocks you told me about?

106
00:44:13,785 --> 00:44:15,665
Can we just not walk,
and take the boat instead?

107
00:44:16,421 --> 00:44:17,616
So c'mon, tell them!

108
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:06,802
Muscle relaxers?

109
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,804
C'mon, man.

110
00:58:19,764 --> 00:58:20,764
Put this on.

111
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:47,416
No offense but she wasn't hypnotized.

112
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:50,950
No way she was going to suck your dick.

113
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:52,223
Impossible.

114
00:58:52,296 --> 00:58:54,527
Yeah, but did you notice
when she grabbed the coal?

115
00:58:54,899 --> 00:58:55,992
Did you see her face?

116
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:00,736
She was in a fucking trance.

117
00:59:14,251 --> 00:59:15,879
Man, you fascinate me.

118
00:59:17,822 --> 00:59:18,846
For real.

119
01:07:07,491 --> 01:07:11,690
No wonder, the fire...

120
01:07:12,963 --> 01:07:15,592
...I don't know what it's made of.

121
01:07:17,334 --> 01:07:19,269
No wonder...

122
01:07:20,437 --> 01:07:21,996
...it burns me...

123
01:07:23,273 --> 01:07:24,832
...I don't comprehend it.

124
01:10:28,492 --> 01:10:30,120
Are you guys on drugs?

125
01:10:30,193 --> 01:10:31,593
I don't know what's wrong with her.

126
01:10:31,628 --> 01:10:33,563
She hasn't been sleeping
and burned her hand.

127
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:35,861
Is it bad? I know a doctor...

128
01:10:36,166 --> 01:10:37,190
If you need one.

129
01:10:37,601 --> 01:10:38,830
Do you have sleeping pills?

130
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:40,446
We don't use those.
I have something better...

131
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:41,768
let's go to the house.

132
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:43,100
- Now!
- Let's go.

133
01:11:04,828 --> 01:11:06,262
Who did this to you?

134
01:11:29,753 --> 01:11:30,812
It hurts?

135
01:11:49,739 --> 01:11:53,141
I gave her some herbs, she has to
drink them with hot water.

136
01:12:03,753 --> 01:12:05,915
Why are you talking to me in English?

137
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:11,225
This shit's a mess.

138
01:12:27,911 --> 01:12:29,937
This idiot had another fight with Alicia.

139
01:19:08,711 --> 01:19:10,270
Agustín, where are you? Over.

140
01:19:15,318 --> 01:19:17,997
Barbara, we're messing around
with the walkie-talkies at Bernardo's...

141
01:19:18,021 --> 01:19:19,853
We're having some of Melda's bread.

142
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:21,290
Over and out.

143
01:22:24,373 --> 01:22:25,671
Take her clothes off.

144
01:22:27,743 --> 01:22:29,644
Bernardo, can we take her to your house?

145
01:22:29,846 --> 01:22:30,846
Please.

146
01:22:42,258 --> 01:22:43,317
Put her on the couch.

147
01:22:43,392 --> 01:22:44,392
What's going on?

148
01:22:45,061 --> 01:22:46,154
Laurita, go to bed!

149
01:23:01,944 --> 01:23:03,344
What's going on Agustín?

150
01:23:03,412 --> 01:23:06,041
She jumped in the lake. She says
she hasn't slept in four days...

151
01:23:06,115 --> 01:23:07,915
I don't know what the
fuck is wrong with her!

152
01:23:08,751 --> 01:23:10,219
Calm down, what's wrong baby?

153
01:23:10,519 --> 01:23:11,817
I have some sleeping pills.

154
01:23:11,888 --> 01:23:13,015
What pills?

155
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:16,359
- Give her two.
- I'm not giving her those things.

156
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:18,560
Let me do this.

157
01:23:21,097 --> 01:23:22,963
Easy, easy...
Open your mouth.

158
01:23:24,901 --> 01:23:25,901
Come on, open your mouth.

159
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:29,361
Open your mouth... there you go.

160
01:23:30,606 --> 01:23:32,074
- Calm down.
- Swallow.

161
01:23:32,642 --> 01:23:34,008
Melda, you said you knew a doctor.

162
01:23:34,443 --> 01:23:36,241
- She is not a doctor!
- Yes she is!

163
01:23:36,412 --> 01:23:37,937
Where you picked me up.

164
01:23:38,047 --> 01:23:39,606
Anything is better than here.

165
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:43,880
Calm down, OK?

166
01:23:44,053 --> 01:23:45,214
Hey, come, come.

167
01:23:57,433 --> 01:24:00,699
She is your friend, OK? She is
going to take care of you.

168
01:24:02,338 --> 01:24:05,058
Look at her, she's going to take
care of you, OK? I'll be right back.

169
01:24:34,904 --> 01:24:36,270
Calm down!

170
01:25:55,284 --> 01:25:56,877
Bernardo gave her sleeping pills.

171
01:25:57,753 --> 01:25:59,016
She is not doing good.

172
01:25:59,555 --> 01:26:01,649
I think she's a bit crazy, look at her.

173
01:26:16,205 --> 01:26:17,639
She is going to get ready now.

174
01:26:17,973 --> 01:26:20,013
Tell your friends that
everything is going to be OK.

175
01:26:55,978 --> 01:26:57,241
Sit over there.

176
01:31:14,136 --> 01:31:15,160
Spanish.

177
01:31:16,905 --> 01:31:18,168
Speak Spanish!

178
01:31:19,341 --> 01:31:20,673
What's going on!

179
01:31:23,212 --> 01:31:24,339
Can you explain!?

180
01:31:25,214 --> 01:31:27,046
She says it's not what it looks like...

181
01:31:27,416 --> 01:31:29,681
Her soul is being purified...

182
01:31:29,752 --> 01:31:32,950
...it will come back to her body
and she will regain consciousness...

183
01:31:33,021 --> 01:31:35,456
- ...but we have to let her finish.
- That's a lie!

184
01:31:35,524 --> 01:31:37,789
She's not breathing! She's not breathing!

185
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:39,988
Call a doctor, please, a doctor!

186
01:31:40,562 --> 01:31:43,555
She's fine! Lower your voice,
