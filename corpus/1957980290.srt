1
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,111
I am exhausted.

2
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,147
I can't wait to get home.

3
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:22,684
Only 30 more minutes to Ocala.

4
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:34,194
Watch out! That looks
like a body on the road!

5
00:01:36,898 --> 00:01:37,832
What--?

6
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:39,968
Aren't you gonna call

7
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,003
-the police?
-No signal.

8
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:46,040
I told you,
nothing good ever happens
when I come through this town.

9
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:51,311
Can't even...

10
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:53,480
Can't even die right.

11
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,227
- <i>The Central</i>
<i>Florida economic news</i>

12
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,030
<i>is not getting any better.</i>

13
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:19,967
<i>From a high of 12,474,</i>

14
00:03:20,101 --> 00:03:23,203
<i>the Dow now sits at 7,500</i>

15
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,372
<i>and experts fear</i>
<i>it could go even lower.</i>

16
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:28,876
<i>2008 is not shaping up to be</i>
<i>a great year economically,</i>

17
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,546
<i>either for Central Florida</i>
<i>or the US.</i>

18
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,782
<i>And if you didn't see it,</i>
<i>viewers, last night,</i>

19
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,518
<i>CBS's</i> 60 Minutes <i>did a profile</i>

20
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:39,921
<i>on the growing problem</i>
<i>of homelessness</i>

21
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:43,356
<i>and they cited Orlando</i>
<i>and Central Florida...</i>

22
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,594
- ...as the epicenter
of homelessness in the nation.

23
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:48,462
Right. And in this segment,

24
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:51,199
members of a downtown
Orlando church

25
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,801
are arrested
for feeding the homeless

26
00:03:53,935 --> 00:03:56,269
So on one hand, we're
the epicenter of homeless...

27
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,305
You're not really 60.

28
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:01,976
You really work
for <i>The Washington Post.</i>

29
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:07,447
You really have 400 000 people
following your blog daily.

30
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,853
You have the body
of a 30-year-old.

31
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:15,790
Okay. Maybe 46 and a half.

32
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,492
Okay.

33
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:21,095
That's enough damage control
for now.

34
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:23,965
You have a mom to check on

35
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:27,568
and an editor to placate.

36
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:31,873
And I love you.

37
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:34,742
Onward.

38
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,514
Okay.

39
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:19,486
What part of responsibility
don't you get?

40
00:05:19,954 --> 00:05:23,356
- It's eleven o'clock
in the morning.

41
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,661
You could have had
three job interviews already.

42
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:32,800
Hey. Hey, stop it.

43
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:35,536
What are you trying to do?
Kill me, woman? Let go.

44
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:41,175
I'm having a very trying day.

45
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:42,910
Don't tempt me.

46
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:46,080
Mercy's never been
their gift, sis.

47
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:48,448
And hard work...

48
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:52,485
-...was never yours.
-Ha, ha, ha.

49
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:02,997
You didn't even make it
to the driveway last night.

50
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,364
Ah!

51
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,301
You don't have a job.

52
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:09,203
I need help with mom.

53
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:11,404
You are not killing it.

54
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:14,575
I got things cooking.
I really do. I...

55
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:18,779
I had, I had two job interviews
last week. Two.

56
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,048
And I don't know
if you've noticed,

57
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:24,484
but there's this,
uh, thing, like a...

58
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,254
...recession...

59
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,156
...e-- everywhere.
It's coming all around, so...

60
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:32,593
You're just gonna have
to get some help.

61
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:35,129
-The alcohol is killing you.
-What?

62
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:39,700
What's going on with you?
Who d-- Who died

63
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,503
and gave you the keys
to the kingdom, Your Majesty?

64
00:06:43,037 --> 00:06:44,605
You see, I am simply a subject,

65
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:46,841
able to travel through
and make my own path.

66
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:56,550
- The only path you're on
is a downward one.

67
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:58,920
Let me get you into a place.

68
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:01,555
You, you need some help,
Tony. Real help.

69
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:03,891
I don't need help.

70
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,494
When I need you I will call you.

71
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:09,597
What I do need...

72
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:14,835
I need some sleep.

73
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,641
I'm meeting Mom and
the Director Devonte at noon.

74
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:22,610
Would love some support.

75
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,145
Meet me there.

76
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:26,881
Okay. Okay.

77
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:28,883
Uh, just gimme a minute.

78
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:31,619
Picking myself together.

79
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:34,121
Noon. Please don't be late.

80
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:36,090
You know me.

81
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,159
Yeah, that's why I said,
"Don't be late."

82
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,766
I know me too.

83
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:52,740
Me is fine.

84
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:55,475
Me just need some sleep.

85
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,044
Okay.

86
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,016
You could have closed
the curtain!

87
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:25,339
Hey.

88
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:27,308
No, no. This no sleeping place.

89
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:28,542
Go. Go.

90
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:29,710
I got customer coming.

91
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:44,992
You don't go?

92
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:47,028
If you don't go, I call police.

93
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:51,799
Give me police.

94
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:05,679
Hey, Sport.

95
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:07,982
Can I get you something?

96
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:10,051
Cup of coffee?

97
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:11,085
Donut?

98
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:16,023
I, I'm powerful hungry
right now.

99
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:19,894
In that case, let me
pick us up some breakfast.

100
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:30,971
Is your brother coming?

101
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,606
Apparently not.

102
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,975
Um, so we'll just go ahead.

103
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:36,010
Certainly.

104
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,179
Dr. Ortiz is recommending

105
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:41,015
a more substantive plan
for your mother's care.

106
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:43,250
Even with increased dosages, her

107
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,386
dementia is worsening.

108
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,223
We had two incidences last week
of your mother trying to leave.

109
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,926
We can no longer
take care of her here.

110
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:57,098
She's going to need to be
transferred to a more secure
memory care unit.

111
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:59,501
We have a couple of suggestions.

112
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,068
One in particular.

113
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:03,704
Grand Vista
is our recommendation.

114
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:06,207
I'll do whatever is necessary.

115
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,476
Give her the best days
you possibly can.

116
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:10,177
Thank you very much.

117
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,641
Claude Anderson.

118
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,679
Sure do appreciate you...

119
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:47,815
...more than you know.

120
00:10:49,584 --> 00:10:50,619
Well, mm.

121
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:53,120
I'm supposed to feed
the hungriest.

122
00:10:53,588 --> 00:10:54,822
Hm. Well...

123
00:10:55,557 --> 00:10:58,159
...pretty good description of me
at the moment, sir.

124
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,963
I'm gonna tell you
probably the first honest thing
I done said all year.

125
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:08,702
It was the first decent meal
I done had in a week.

126
00:11:11,906 --> 00:11:13,908
And I'm addicted to cocaine.

127
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:17,444
And I don't care
whether I live out the day.

128
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,081
Are you open
to me driving you by

129
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,417
and showing you a place
where you can get some help?

130
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:28,389
What kind of help?

131
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,026
The kind you need.

132
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:34,962
Drug rehab.

133
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:38,065
I don't know
whether I'm ready for some help.

134
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,402
Well, truth is,

135
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,004
only you and God know that.

136
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:47,908
You make the first step...

137
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,912
...I think He'll help you
make the next one.

138
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,198
Hey, Mom.

139
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,434
It's your Brandi.

140
00:12:16,671 --> 00:12:18,872
You know, I don't drink.

141
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:27,214
You must be
one of my second graders.

142
00:12:55,543 --> 00:12:58,979
This place here
can be your best trip ever.

143
00:13:07,522 --> 00:13:09,156
You ain't going
in there with me?

144
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:11,225
No. I gotta go back to work.

145
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:14,028
My job is to just
deliver you here.

146
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,465
I'll check in on you later.

147
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:09,350
All right, folks.
Everyone, let me have
your attention, please.

148
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:12,086
Everybody, eyes up.

149
00:14:13,555 --> 00:14:16,524
All right, everyone.
Listen up, please. Listen up.

150
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:20,160
Probably hear some rumors about
what's coming down the p--

151
00:14:20,595 --> 00:14:24,932
Well, well, well, Brandi.
Nice for you to join us
for this cheery meeting.

152
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,768
Aren't they all cheery?

153
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,039
Folks, we used to buy ink
by the barrel,

154
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:34,074
but now we are bleeding it
by the barrel.

155
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:39,079
It's a perfect storm
of growing digital consumption
and falling ad revenue.

156
00:14:39,714 --> 00:14:43,283
The new owners are making
some substantial changes.

157
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,554
It's touching every department,
including Editorial.

158
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:51,258
Senior staff
across all departments
are going to be reassigned

159
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:53,293
or given an early retirement

160
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:55,095
provided for by the paper.

161
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,131
And two of you

162
00:14:57,766 --> 00:15:00,100
will be reassigned
to different bureaus.

163
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:04,138
You know, I hate it.
I don't even know how long

164
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:07,040
my Senior Editing post
is gonna stand.

165
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:11,145
You'll know more as I know more.

166
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,584
- Harry.
- Sit down.

167
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:19,286
We're on our third owner, Brandi

168
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:22,657
They are making the decisions.
They must keep the paper afloat.

169
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:25,125
Sometimes there's
greater forces at work that--

170
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,862
Oh, Harry... Spare me.

171
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:29,764
Are you 12-stepping me?

172
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:31,131
You gonna let me finish?

173
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:34,502
You were
in the first round of cuts,

174
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,003
but I fought hard.

175
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:37,938
The best I can get
was you transferred

176
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,674
to Lake County Bureau.

177
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:43,076
Lake County?
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

178
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,145
My mother is deteriorating,
you know.

179
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,247
That's the assignment
if you wanna stay in the game.

180
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:51,920
-Well, I appreciate
the heart, Harry.
-Oh, all I can do, sweets.

181
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,957
-My blog is, is starting
to post some decent numbers.
-True.

182
00:15:57,792 --> 00:16:00,961
-True, but what?
-Your acerbic wit and comments

183
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,964
- haven't exactly endeared you
to the new management.

184
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,733
Oh, you sound like my ex!

185
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:08,202
The Brass is keeping
you on for the time being.

186
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,204
They're just lowering
your volume a bit.

187
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:15,710
-You get Lake County.
-They might as well have
assigned me to the Everglades.

188
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:16,977
Well, it is what it is.

189
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:20,314
But... I will still be
your editor.

190
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:21,982
Hey, the lotto came up.

191
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:23,050
You won Lake County.

192
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,153
Yeah. I'm a winner.

193
00:16:26,588 --> 00:16:27,789
Big time.

194
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:29,490
Have a good day, Brandi.

195
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:32,827
All right. Thanks.

196
00:17:47,969 --> 00:17:49,871
Mrs. Kapoor,
just to let you know that the,

197
00:17:50,004 --> 00:17:52,974
the church is still
very interested
in purchasing your motel.

198
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,309
My husband and I have
talked about this,

199
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:56,811
and we know
what the church wants.

200
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:58,980
And I also know
that the other Indian families

201
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:01,749
will not be very happy
with us if we sell to you.

202
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:04,251
But...

203
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:06,955
...my husband is not well.

204
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,991
And we want to move
closer to our children.

205
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,094
Do you have the money? 600 000?

206
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:17,097
Um, that's something
I would have to work on.

207
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,601
For sure. But...

208
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:22,937
...how soon would you be
looking to, to, to sell?

209
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:24,072
Soon.

210
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:36,618
I trust you Lord, but...

211
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:41,221
...six hundred thousand dollars
plus repairs...

212
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:43,858
...a million dollars.

213
00:18:58,773 --> 00:19:01,274
This isn't going to hack it.

214
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:04,311
Traveling to see my mom
is exhausting

215
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:07,515
<i>and these small town stories</i>
<i>are killing me.</i>

216
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:09,984
Lake County is part
of our subscriber base,

217
00:19:10,118 --> 00:19:11,786
so they get face time.

218
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,488
<i>Your job, dear,</i>
<i>is to provide content.</i>

219
00:19:14,622 --> 00:19:16,323
Since I've been here,

220
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:20,160
nothing I've written
has risen above page B8.

221
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:22,030
Oh, I got one for you.

222
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,532
A tip I just got
about a church story.

223
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,768
<i>What? Religion news?</i>

224
00:19:26,901 --> 00:19:28,435
You know, that's not me.

225
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:32,305
I know. I want you
to dig on this a little bit.

226
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,242
Church in Leesburg
wants to buy a motel.

227
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:39,681
Am I so low
that you send me to cover
real estate transactions?

228
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,816
It's what they wanna do
with a motel

229
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:43,618
that makes this
a bit more unusual.

230
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:47,588
Harry, I am the last one
to cover this story.

231
00:19:47,722 --> 00:19:50,357
I despise organized religion.

232
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:53,260
This church is a bit different

233
00:19:53,728 --> 00:19:55,830
<i>While back, they voted</i>
<i>not to build a new sanctuary</i>

234
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:57,765
<i>and use their money</i>
<i>to build shelters</i>

235
00:19:57,899 --> 00:19:59,701
<i>and drug treatment</i>
<i>centers instead.</i>

236
00:20:00,134 --> 00:20:02,235
Okay. A bit different.

237
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,838
Now they want purchase a motel

238
00:20:03,971 --> 00:20:06,841
and turn it into a shelter
for homeless families.

239
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:09,677
Listen, editorial
likes local stories

240
00:20:09,811 --> 00:20:11,746
tied in with a national
news cycle.

241
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:14,115
This could be a good time
with the <i>60 Minutes</i> piece.

242
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:15,883
<i>It's worth looking into.</i>

243
00:20:16,017 --> 00:20:19,252
You are not squirming
out of this.

244
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:21,321
First Baptist Leesburg,

245
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:24,357
a Southern Baptist church
on the main thoroughfare.

246
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:27,795
Oh, you mean the group that
created their own denomination

247
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:29,697
so they could keep slavery,
that one?

248
00:20:30,164 --> 00:20:32,967
<i>A jewel piece.</i>
<i>Marvelous. I can't wait.</i>

249
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:35,737
All right, go easy.
I got a good feeling about this.

250
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,772
<i>-Well, you know me.</i>
-I do know you.

251
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:40,508
Listen, that story
you did about the pastor
defrauding a church,

252
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:42,577
that was one thing.
This is another.

253
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:44,045
Do some digging.

254
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:46,446
<i>My gut tells me</i>
<i>there's some kind of story here.</i>

255
00:20:46,581 --> 00:20:49,984
Oh, are you sure
your gut didn't have
too much salsa last night?

256
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:51,986
All right, Brandi. Get on it.

257
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,471
-Thanks for seeing me.
-Chairman of
the Finance Committee?

258
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:13,875
Of course, I'm gonna
see you.

259
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:17,277
Sorry to interrupt your study,
but this is getting urgent.

260
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:19,412
I assume this is
about last night's meeting.

261
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:22,683
We've had some good years,
but now it's...

262
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:27,588
I guess I was
really successful in preaching

263
00:21:27,722 --> 00:21:29,257
in the great recession, huh?

264
00:21:29,724 --> 00:21:31,926
It's the economy.
We all know it.

265
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:33,594
People were afraid,

266
00:21:34,095 --> 00:21:36,496
especially our seniors
on a fixed income.

267
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,101
Right now, we just hunker down
and try to survive.

268
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:44,105
Gene, I don't think
I read anywhere
in the scriptures about

269
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:45,973
hunkering down.

270
00:21:46,641 --> 00:21:48,142
Think they lean more

271
00:21:48,276 --> 00:21:50,845
to stepping out
and, and trusting

272
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:52,914
that God will make a way.

273
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:57,185
I understand cash flow
and right now
we just don't have it.

274
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:00,588
The working capital is negative
and we are borrowing

275
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:04,457
short-term operating capital
from designated funds.

276
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:09,063
Now, with us being
$200,000 below budget...

277
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:13,067
...here's a list
of suggested layoffs.

278
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:17,470
Oh.

279
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:21,309
I hate it, but...
sometimes we just have

280
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:24,078
- to step back
from the needs around us.

281
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:26,881
And sometimes...

282
00:22:27,882 --> 00:22:29,482
...we need to step forward.

283
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:34,822
I am trusting God

284
00:22:34,956 --> 00:22:37,490
and so is every member
of our committee.

285
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,261
However, 200K is 200K

286
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:42,495
and we will live
within our means.

287
00:22:44,732 --> 00:22:47,501
-Anything else?
-All plans are on hold

288
00:22:47,635 --> 00:22:49,737
until we get the ship
in an upright position.

289
00:22:50,805 --> 00:22:53,841
-God's got a plan.
-So does the Finance Committee.

290
00:22:58,746 --> 00:23:02,283
Cec, Chaplain Pete
wants see you in his office.

291
00:23:02,817 --> 00:23:04,719
Okay. All right.
I'll be right in a second.

292
00:23:04,852 --> 00:23:06,754
Let me put my stuff on my bunk.

293
00:23:10,124 --> 00:23:11,192
Am I in trouble?

294
00:23:11,325 --> 00:23:12,860
Not in the least.

295
00:23:12,994 --> 00:23:14,829
<i>Okay, Cecil, this is the deal.</i>

296
00:23:14,962 --> 00:23:17,464
<i>You've made a strong recovery.</i>

297
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:21,068
<i>You finished the first phase</i>
<i>of the program.</i>

298
00:23:21,202 --> 00:23:22,402
<i>You've been A plus.</i>

299
00:23:22,904 --> 00:23:24,705
That's a first.

300
00:23:25,273 --> 00:23:28,441
I can't read.
Ain't never made an A in school.

301
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:32,146
We wanna talk to you
about your next steps.

302
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,115
Mr. Pete, I don't wanna leave.

303
00:23:35,016 --> 00:23:36,751
I'm afraid
I'll just mess it all up

304
00:23:36,884 --> 00:23:39,887
and go right back to living
in the pit I was in before.

305
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:42,023
Is any way I can have
some more time?

306
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:47,028
That's what we want.
We have six beds reserved
for our disciples program.

307
00:23:47,161 --> 00:23:51,132
<i>We feel like you</i>
<i>would be a great asset</i>
<i>to the other men.</i>

308
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:53,334
Arrange it. Set me up.

309
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:57,505
That's what I want.
Sign me up, please.

310
00:23:58,572 --> 00:23:59,707
That's my family now.

311
00:24:00,675 --> 00:24:04,178
And I love my mama,
and I, I look forward
to seeing them all, but...

312
00:24:05,346 --> 00:24:06,647
...I ain't fit to be...

313
00:24:07,381 --> 00:24:08,716
...back on my own again.

314
00:24:12,687 --> 00:24:15,389
-Hey, friend. How are you doing?
-I'm fine, sir.

315
00:24:15,523 --> 00:24:16,791
Cecil Clark.
Glad to have you here.

316
00:24:16,924 --> 00:24:18,826
My name's Cecil too.

317
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,962
Yeah. I stay over
at the Men's Center.

318
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:22,563
-Okay.
-Just been made disciple,

319
00:24:22,697 --> 00:24:24,298
so you probably be
seeing me quite a bit.

320
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,168
- Well, we can never have
too many Cecils around here.

321
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:29,103
-Glad to meet another one.
-All right.

322
00:24:29,236 --> 00:24:30,470
I'll bet a lot
better looking one.

323
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:32,139
Oh, come on now.

324
00:24:32,273 --> 00:24:33,908
Hey, we have
to do lunch sometime.

325
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:37,044
-I'd like that. I'd like that.
Look forward to it.
-Good deal.

326
00:24:37,178 --> 00:24:38,579
-All right.
-Great to meet you.

327
00:24:38,713 --> 00:24:40,081
Oh, likewise. Thank you.

328
00:24:40,982 --> 00:24:43,084
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

329
00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:45,853
-Hi. How can I help you?
-Brandi Michaels.

330
00:24:45,987 --> 00:24:48,656
I'm from the <i>Orlando Sentinel</i>
to see the pastor.

331
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:51,025
Great. He's expecting you.
You can head right in.

332
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:54,695
Ms. Michaels, hi.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

333
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:56,063
Please.

334
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:02,636
Real curious on, uh,
on why you wanted to meet.

335
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:06,640
Well, first off,
I'm not the religion reporter.

336
00:25:06,774 --> 00:25:09,543
I do local news,
community affairs,

337
00:25:09,677 --> 00:25:13,814
opinion, the courthouse,
and some political.

338
00:25:13,948 --> 00:25:17,685
So in the downsizing,
you got Leesburg.

339
00:25:18,486 --> 00:25:19,987
Something like that.

340
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:21,756
My main reason for being here

341
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:24,959
is to learn more about the motel
I've heard you're buying.

342
00:25:25,426 --> 00:25:27,294
And how did you hear about that?

343
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:28,929
It's not a mystery.

344
00:25:29,063 --> 00:25:31,732
We review all the city
commission agendas

345
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:34,635
and we noticed the church's
special use request.

346
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:36,070
Well...

347
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:38,439
...as the news
has repeatedly pointed out,

348
00:25:38,572 --> 00:25:41,742
- homelessness is the real deal
here are in Central Florida.

349
00:25:41,876 --> 00:25:45,679
You know, right now we are
just buried with requests.

350
00:25:45,813 --> 00:25:47,448
We have families
where the mother and father

351
00:25:47,581 --> 00:25:49,417
have lost their job
in the same week,

352
00:25:49,884 --> 00:25:51,886
with single moms and dads
trying to do anything they can

353
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:54,088
to keep their families together.

354
00:25:54,455 --> 00:25:56,057
Lake County has the highest

355
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,893
unemployment rate
in, in the entire state.

356
00:25:59,026 --> 00:26:01,695
-So, I've heard.
-It's like <i>The Grapes of Wrath.</i>

357
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:03,697
You know, we're,
we're thinking about

358
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:06,801
and praying on,
on what we can do.

359
00:26:07,502 --> 00:26:09,603
Well, when you buy this motel,

360
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:13,641
-what exactly are you planning
on doing with it?
<i>-If</i> we get the motel.

361
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:16,343
-There's a question?
-Oh, there's a big question.

362
00:26:16,477 --> 00:26:18,579
A big giant <i>if</i> .

363
00:26:19,213 --> 00:26:21,916
Right now we're underwater
with our budget,

364
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:24,285
and it'll take
about a million dollars

365
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:26,253
to acquire and fix it up.

366
00:26:26,854 --> 00:26:29,323
And it has to happen
very quickly.

367
00:26:29,457 --> 00:26:31,258
So, we are very much
living in the world of <i>if.</i>

368
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:36,330
Why are you pursuing
a piece of real estate
without the resources?

369
00:26:37,331 --> 00:26:39,867
Sometimes you just have
to jump off the boat.

370
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:44,638
I'm hoping the Finance Committee
doesn't fire me.

371
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:49,410
-Well, there are worse reasons
for being terminated, I guess.
-Yes. Yes, ma'am.

372
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:53,647
Well, I look forward
to meeting one of the residents.

373
00:26:53,781 --> 00:26:56,283
Oh, yes, uh,
I have just the man for you.

374
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:57,918
His name is Cecil.

375
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:00,488
You can ask him
anything you want.

376
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:02,189
They're expecting you
over at the Men's Center.

377
00:27:02,323 --> 00:27:05,392
-Great.
-Ms. Michaels, just curious,

378
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:08,295
uh, do you have a church
you attend anywhere?

379
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:10,664
I ask the questions,

380
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:12,933
please remember
and respect that.

381
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:14,835
I'll do my best.

382
00:27:24,078 --> 00:27:25,646
May I help you, ma'am?

383
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:27,414
Yes. The pastor
has arranged for me

384
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:30,585
to tour the facility
and meet one of your residents.

385
00:27:30,718 --> 00:27:34,221
Chaplain Pete has you
set up to meet with, uh, Cecil.

386
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:36,924
He's just finishing up
the dishes from lunch.

387
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:38,359
I'll grab him for you.

388
00:27:39,561 --> 00:27:42,663
Cec, you've got visitor.

389
00:27:45,132 --> 00:27:48,202
Cec, lady from the paper
is here to see you.

390
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:49,303
Okay.

391
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,440
- Brandi Michaels.
- Hey.

392
00:27:53,575 --> 00:27:55,009
I'm from the <i>Orlando Sentinel.</i>

393
00:27:55,142 --> 00:27:57,811
Ms. Michaels, nice to meet you.
I'm Cecil Johnson.

394
00:27:57,945 --> 00:27:59,813
-Pleasure, pleasure.
-Nice to meet you.

395
00:27:59,947 --> 00:28:02,249
Uh, is there a place
we could go sit?

396
00:28:02,383 --> 00:28:06,687
-And d-- do you mind if...
-Oh, everything's fine.
We can...

397
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,956
-Actually, here. Right this way.
-Thank you.

398
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:13,961
This interview
shouldn't take super long

399
00:28:14,094 --> 00:28:16,363
Oh, my time is your time,
Ms. Brandi.

400
00:28:16,497 --> 00:28:19,634
- I always like talking
about what the Lord is doing.

401
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:22,571
I'm working a story
about this church

402
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:24,573
intending to buy
the Big Bass Motel

403
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:27,542
and I asked the pastor
if I could talk with someone

404
00:28:27,676 --> 00:28:30,878
who's, who's been on the streets
and you were the victim.

405
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,915
Well, sure I am not a victim
no longer, Ms. Brandi.

406
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,918
Well, it's just
figure of speech.

407
00:28:38,052 --> 00:28:40,589
Uh, can we start
with your background

408
00:28:40,754 --> 00:28:44,391
and your journey
in getting here?

409
00:28:44,825 --> 00:28:48,762
I grew up in,
in Georgia, around Atlanta.

410
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:50,297
Uh...

411
00:28:50,931 --> 00:28:53,702
Never saw my dad...
until I was 18.

412
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:57,438
And even then,
when I saw him for the first
time, it was in the casket.

413
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,542
<i>My mama primarily did cleaning.</i>

414
00:29:00,675 --> 00:29:01,643
<i>She took up ironing.</i>

415
00:29:01,775 --> 00:29:03,877
<i>But we was, we was always broke</i>

416
00:29:04,011 --> 00:29:06,247
<i>and I just got tired of watching</i>

417
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,848
<i>my mama work herself to death.</i>

418
00:29:07,982 --> 00:29:11,085
So... I always worked to do
what I could do,

419
00:29:11,218 --> 00:29:12,587
whenever I could do it.

420
00:29:13,854 --> 00:29:17,525
You know, when I was 13,
we, uh, ain't had much money.

421
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:19,893
I had cardboard in my shoes.

422
00:29:20,027 --> 00:29:21,462
My momma couldn't
afford me no shoes.

423
00:29:21,596 --> 00:29:25,866
So, so, I hopped the truck
and followed the workers

424
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,703
up to New York
where they was picking apples.

425
00:29:29,336 --> 00:29:32,106
Right away, I started
shacking up with an older woman,

426
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:34,041
worked on one of the crews.

427
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:37,478
It didn't last too long
'cause police came

428
00:29:37,612 --> 00:29:40,582
and picked me up
'cause I was under age.

429
00:29:41,616 --> 00:29:44,985
So when I came back,
I was in school some,

430
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:46,420
but then I quit

431
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:49,423
and I started working again.

432
00:29:50,592 --> 00:29:53,861
But, uh, when I got
introduced to crack...

433
00:29:54,629 --> 00:29:56,130
...I lost everything and..

434
00:29:57,197 --> 00:29:59,133
...ended up homeless in Atlanta.

435
00:30:00,535 --> 00:30:03,904
So, my mama moved
out here to Florida.

436
00:30:04,706 --> 00:30:06,106
<i>And, uh, she was trying to,</i>

437
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,075
you know, keep me
away from the drugs,

438
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:09,843
but that didn't work.

439
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:12,346
I just got deeper into it.

440
00:30:13,113 --> 00:30:15,082
Started dealing myself and...

441
00:30:16,383 --> 00:30:17,885
...got in trouble with the law.

442
00:30:18,018 --> 00:30:19,386
What happened?

443
00:30:24,325 --> 00:30:26,026
-What's happening, bro?
-What's up, troopa?

444
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,395
-Yeah, just killing, my bro.
You all right?
-I'm good, man.

445
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,364
-You'll be here for a minute?
-Yeah, I'll be out
here for a minute.

446
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:31,999
All right. I gotta take care of
something. I'll be right back.

447
00:30:32,132 --> 00:30:33,067
Be right back.

What?

501
00:33:44,826 --> 00:33:45,693
Okay.

502
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:49,731
Cecil, I'm so sorry.
I'm, I'm gonna have to run.

503
00:33:49,864 --> 00:33:52,567
-Well, that's all right.
-I'll, uh, I'll call the Center

504
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,903
and reschedule
for a second interview.

505

to get to the part

507
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,175
where I get to tell you
about the angel that I met.

508
00:34:04,077 --> 00:34:05,245
Angel?

509
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:11,151
As in feathers and wings?

510
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:13,721
I'll let you decide.

511
00:34:14,822 --> 00:34:19,293
- Okay. Well, we'll pick it
back up when we next meet, okay?

512
00:34:19,727 --> 00:34:21,395
-Thank you.
-All right. No problem.

513
00:34:21,529 --> 00:34:23,598
Look forward to meeting
with you again, Ms. Brandi.

514
00:34:29,637 --> 00:34:33,407
And what's happening that you
need to speak to me so badly?

515
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,208
It's just, um...

516
00:34:37,011 --> 00:34:39,881
I, I'm flat busted and I need,
I need to borrow 200 bucks

517
00:34:40,014 --> 00:34:42,550
-or my, my lights
are gonna get shut off.
<i>-Mm.</i>

518
00:34:42,684 --> 00:34:43,785
Forget about it.

519
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,353
How much did you invest
in that hangover?

520
00:34:46,486 --> 00:34:48,556
<i>You need to join the workforce</i>

521
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,892
<i>- and drop the alcohol.</i>
- Great.

522
00:34:51,025 --> 00:34:54,227
I'm the only 52-year-old
in Orlando with two mommys.
Thank you.

523
00:34:54,361 --> 00:34:56,664
<i>Tony, you have a choice to make.</i>

524
00:34:56,798 --> 00:34:58,600
<i>Just because dad</i>
<i>went down this path,</i>

525
00:34:58,733 --> 00:35:00,267
<i>it doesn't mean you need to.</i>

526
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:04,338
When I saw you laid out,
hungover the other day,

527
00:35:04,471 --> 00:35:07,441
it brought dad back, everything.

528
00:35:08,076 --> 00:35:09,911
Great. Great.

529
00:35:10,645 --> 00:35:12,680
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll, I'll go sit,

530
00:35:12,814 --> 00:35:14,481
I'll go stand on, uh, 436

531
00:35:14,616 --> 00:35:16,551
and I'll just beg for money.
How about that?

532
00:35:17,284 --> 00:35:21,923
Oh, good plan.
You can stand out there like
a Vietnam vet with a sign...

533
00:35:22,322 --> 00:35:26,493
...along with
all the others who were,
like, born in 1980.

534
00:35:26,628 --> 00:35:29,030
Uh, you know what?
That's a great idea.

535
00:35:29,162 --> 00:35:30,565
Thank you very much.
You know what?

536
00:35:30,698 --> 00:35:33,166
This conversation is over.
Thank you for nothing.

537
00:35:50,084 --> 00:35:52,620
The Planning and Zoning Director
will see you now.

538
00:35:58,826 --> 00:36:00,360
-Great to see you...
-Yes.

539
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:01,963
-...again, Pastor.
-Yes, yes, yes.

540
00:36:02,096 --> 00:36:04,732
This is Bill Jones.
He's the Director of Operations

541
00:36:04,866 --> 00:36:06,634
and he's the one heading up
this project.

542
00:36:06,768 --> 00:36:09,202
Here are, uh,
some more members of the team.

543
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:11,639
There's the Director
of Community Affairs

544
00:36:11,773 --> 00:36:14,709
-and the Assistant City Manager.
-Pleasure.

545
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:19,312
Our team has taken a look
at the church's proposal

546
00:36:19,446 --> 00:36:22,550
and we're finding it
problematic.

547
00:36:23,618 --> 00:36:25,720
Taking care of the homeless
is problematic?

548
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:28,656
Within current zonings, yes.

549
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,525
We just wanna show you
what you're up against

550
00:36:30,658 --> 00:36:32,727
with the Zoning
and Planning Commission

551
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,062
and the City Commission.

552
00:36:35,063 --> 00:36:38,099
-Okay.
-One, your current zoning
is church use

553
00:36:38,231 --> 00:36:40,935
and this will take
a special exception use permit.

554
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:43,871
- Excuse me?
- This is not church use.

555
00:36:44,005 --> 00:36:46,741
This would fall under commercial
zoning and not church.

556
00:36:47,575 --> 00:36:50,511
Gentlemen, church
is not what happens

557
00:36:50,645 --> 00:36:52,914
on Sunday mornings
from a 11:00 to 12:00.

558
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:55,550
This is... church use.

559
00:36:55,683 --> 00:36:57,518
This is exactly church use. We,

560
00:36:57,985 --> 00:37:01,488
we f-- feed the hungry
and, and house the homeless.

561
00:37:01,622 --> 00:37:03,256
That's what
we're supposed to do.

562
00:37:04,158 --> 00:37:09,262
So, o-- our position
is that this is 100%
church use zoning.

563
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,332
Plus you wanna build this
on a commercial corridor.

564
00:37:12,767 --> 00:37:14,502
The city's cleaning this up
and developing

565
00:37:14,635 --> 00:37:16,904
commercial businesses
for the benefit of the citizens.

566
00:37:17,038 --> 00:37:20,942
T-- T-- This is for the benefit
of the citizens,

567
00:37:21,374 --> 00:37:22,944
only for those who have less.

568
00:37:23,077 --> 00:37:26,346
The church's attitude
is admirable,

569
00:37:26,914 --> 00:37:29,016
but there's
an additional problem.

570
00:37:29,784 --> 00:37:32,486
You're infringing upon
the city's historical district

571
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,689
and there is someone
in the commission who feel

572
00:37:34,822 --> 00:37:37,091
you're exacerbating the
homeless problem in our city.

573
00:37:40,595 --> 00:37:42,764
We're taking
men and women off the streets.

574
00:37:42,897 --> 00:37:45,633
-I'd classify that
as helping solve the problem.
-Yes.

575
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:47,969
One commissioner's comment was,

576
00:37:48,503 --> 00:37:52,240
"If you feed a stray cat,
you're just going to attract
more cats."

577
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,475
Some of the city see you
as contributing
to the homeless problem.

578
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:59,747
And now you wanna purchase
a motel and attract even more
homeless people to Leesburg?

579
00:38:00,748 --> 00:38:03,785
Some of the
commissioners are not excited...

580
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:06,988
-...to put it mildly.
-Speaking of,

581
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:10,057
I understand you don't even own
the property yet.

582
00:38:10,725 --> 00:38:14,228
Yeah, I'm meeting again
with the, the owners
of the motel tomorrow.

583
00:38:14,796 --> 00:38:16,463
Once you get this
fully under contract,

584
00:38:16,597 --> 00:38:18,266
you can make it pass
with the full commission,

585
00:38:18,398 --> 00:38:21,002
but, uh...
don't hold your breath.

586
00:38:25,907 --> 00:38:28,308
Okay. All right.

587
00:38:30,377 --> 00:38:32,412
I, I'm changing
your job title now.

588
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,149
You're now
Director of Stray Cats.

589
00:38:35,283 --> 00:38:38,052
I'll stop by
the pet store on the way home.

590
00:38:38,186 --> 00:38:39,419
Sheesh.

591
00:38:51,966 --> 00:38:55,169
I need the school board's view
on homelessness in Lake County,

592
00:38:55,303 --> 00:38:58,906
uh, and on an organization
attempting to buy a motel

593
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,142
so that they can house
homeless families.

594
00:39:01,576 --> 00:39:05,246
Haven't heard about that.
Who's trying to buy a motel
for the homeless?

595
00:39:05,378 --> 00:39:08,549
A church,
First Baptist, Leesburg.

596
00:39:10,685 --> 00:39:11,853
Why? Is there
a problem with that?

597
00:39:11,986 --> 00:39:14,722
No, no. Not hardly.

598
00:39:14,856 --> 00:39:17,792
Two years ago they adopted
one of our F schools.

599
00:39:17,925 --> 00:39:19,861
They helped raise it
to a C school.

600
00:39:19,994 --> 00:39:20,695
Mm.

601
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:25,132
Well, they're trying
to buy this motel.

602
00:39:25,266 --> 00:39:26,868
<i>And from what I hear, they say</i>

603
00:39:27,001 --> 00:39:30,403
<i>that there's a higher incidence</i>
<i>of homeless families.</i>

604
00:39:30,538 --> 00:39:31,973
Central Florida has been in harm

605
00:39:32,106 --> 00:39:34,275
because construction
and development have sold.

606
00:39:34,407 --> 00:39:37,678
<i>Our county has the highest</i>
<i>unemployment rate in the state,</i>

607
00:39:37,812 --> 00:39:40,748
<i>and it shows most in the kids.</i>
<i>Our last in-house census</i>

608
00:39:40,882 --> 00:39:43,818
<i>showed over 1000 kids</i>
<i>classified as homeless,</i>

609
00:39:43,951 --> 00:39:46,120
either living with a relative
or a surrogate

610
00:39:46,587 --> 00:39:47,889
<i>or even with their family unit.</i>

611
00:39:48,022 --> 00:39:50,091
Which means you have tenants.

612
00:39:50,224 --> 00:39:53,493
-I know, I, I'm going to--
-Well, you're gonna
have them leave today

613
00:39:54,128 --> 00:39:56,764
or I'm gonna terminate
your lease.

614
00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:00,334
They'll be gone today.

615
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:02,036
Uh-huh, good.

616
00:40:10,611 --> 00:40:14,348
<i>So you think</i>
<i>a short-term solution</i>
<i>would make a difference?</i>

617
00:40:14,715 --> 00:40:18,451
My vote would be
to have one in every city
in our county.

618
00:40:18,586 --> 00:40:22,690
We are gonna go
on a new adventure, okay?
And it's gonna be so much fun.

619
00:40:23,124 --> 00:40:24,759
-Come on.
-Okay.

620
00:40:24,892 --> 00:40:27,228
Okay. Okay.

621
00:40:27,929 --> 00:40:31,065
Children and families are
living in pay-by-night hotels.

622
00:40:31,198 --> 00:40:33,100
<i>There are tents,</i>
<i>you name it.</i>

623
00:41:07,101 --> 00:41:09,603
You can imagine
how it affects their education.

624
00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:11,806
Thanks.

625
00:41:12,373 --> 00:41:13,641
This has been helpful.

626
00:41:27,188 --> 00:41:29,489
Hi. I came as soon
as I got your call.

627
00:41:29,623 --> 00:41:30,891
Thank you.

628
00:41:31,025 --> 00:41:32,560
We will still sell to you,

629
00:41:32,693 --> 00:41:34,929
but we can only
give you 30 days.

630
00:41:36,197 --> 00:41:37,565
Th-- Thirty days?

631
00:41:37,698 --> 00:41:41,002
So far,
we have nine cash offers.

632
00:41:45,272 --> 00:41:47,742
I guess if God could create
the Earth in six days,

633
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:50,845
He can buy a motel in 30.

634
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:55,983
And if we don't have the money
in 30 days,

635
00:41:56,117 --> 00:41:58,619
then I guess we're out
on the street, so to speak.

636
00:41:59,186 --> 00:42:02,256
You did get my attention
with the angel thing.

637
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:04,158
Yeah, well...

638
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:06,427
...I'm done for sure
that's what it was,

639
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,462
an angel, pure and simple.

640
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:10,297
Chaplain Pete thinks so too.

641
00:42:11,232 --> 00:42:12,867
Okay. I'm all ears.

642
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:15,836
Okay. Well,
lemme see where I leave off.

643
00:42:19,006 --> 00:42:20,574
My mom was praying
in the other room

644
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:22,176
while I was smoking crack.

645
00:42:24,745 --> 00:42:26,180
Jesus...

646
00:42:28,249 --> 00:42:32,319
...I know we done
talked about this

647
00:42:32,453 --> 00:42:35,489
many a times.

648
00:42:35,656 --> 00:42:37,526
So, I had to get outta there.

649
00:42:50,805 --> 00:42:55,476
I've buried three boys!

650
00:42:56,077 --> 00:42:59,613
I ain't letting this one go!

651
00:43:00,781 --> 00:43:05,453
<i>-The devil has</i>
<i>a strong hold on him!</i>
-Just let me die.

652
00:43:07,254 --> 00:43:11,892
It's gonna have to be you
who break the devil's knuckles!

653
00:43:12,026 --> 00:43:14,628
Can't do this
to my mama no more.

654
00:43:18,432 --> 00:43:19,934
Just let me die.

655
00:43:20,401 --> 00:43:23,370
Please.

656
00:43:23,505 --> 00:43:26,006
Please, Lord.

657
00:43:26,841 --> 00:43:28,109
Can't take it.

658
00:43:31,145 --> 00:43:32,179
Just make me go.

659
00:43:36,518 --> 00:43:37,651
Watch out.

660
00:43:41,055 --> 00:43:42,857
Can't even die right.

661
00:43:44,692 --> 00:43:47,027
<i>Ended up falling asleep</i>
<i>in front of a convenience store</i>

662
00:43:47,161 --> 00:43:49,296
<i>where a man came</i>
<i>and picked me up.</i>

663
00:43:49,864 --> 00:43:51,332
Brought me right here.

664
00:43:52,133 --> 00:43:53,367
I'll check in on you later.

665
00:43:56,237 --> 00:44:00,875
It's nice that he noticed you
and was willing to get out
of his own comfort zone.

666
00:44:01,308 --> 00:44:02,810
<i>Oh, I promise you,</i>

667
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:05,913
<i>he was really</i>
<i>out of his comfort zone</i>

668
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,684
<i>I waited a few days</i>
<i>for Mr. Claude to come back</i>
<i>like he said he would...</i>

669
00:44:12,153 --> 00:44:13,454
<i>...but it never happened.</i>

670
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:15,422
<i>So...</i>

671
00:44:15,557 --> 00:44:17,559
<i>...after he didn't call,</i>
<i>I decided to call</i>

672
00:44:17,691 --> 00:44:20,027
<i>where he work.</i>
<i>I just wanted to tell him</i>

673
00:44:20,161 --> 00:44:22,763
<i>thank you for bringing</i>
<i>me into the Center.</i>

674
00:44:23,797 --> 00:44:25,332
<i>BAHR Construction.</i>

675
00:44:25,866 --> 00:44:28,102
Oh, yes. How you doing?
My name is Cecil Johnson

676
00:44:28,235 --> 00:44:30,639
and I was, uh,
I was hoping to speak

677
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:33,274
to one of your Road Supervisors.

678
00:44:33,707 --> 00:44:34,842
<i>Which one?</i>

679
00:44:35,442 --> 00:44:36,744
Claude Anderson.

680
00:44:38,012 --> 00:44:41,415
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>We don't have a Claude Anderson</i>
<i>that works here.</i>

681
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:45,819
-Well, this is BAHR Construction
on Telebox Road, right?
<i>-Yes, it is, sir.</i>

682
00:44:45,953 --> 00:44:50,024
Yeah, well, see,
a few weeks ago I met a man
named Claude Anderson.

683
00:44:50,157 --> 00:44:53,327
He drove a gray truck
and had one of your signs on it.

684
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,630
Said he was one
of the supervisors
on your road crew.

685
00:44:55,763 --> 00:44:58,399
<i>I'm sorry, sir, but</i>
<i>we don't have any gray trucks.</i>

686
00:44:58,533 --> 00:45:00,234
<i>All of our work trucks</i>
<i>are white.</i>

687
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:02,102
<i>Sir, I don't know</i>
<i>who it is you met</i>

688
00:45:02,236 --> 00:45:04,004
<i>that purported to work for us,</i>

689
00:45:04,138 --> 00:45:06,440
<i>but we don't and never have had</i>

690
00:45:06,575 --> 00:45:09,009
<i>-a Claude Anderson work us.</i>
-That don't make...

691
00:45:10,411 --> 00:45:12,346
I know I met him.

692
00:45:12,479 --> 00:45:13,914
<i>I'm really sorry, sir.</i>

693
00:45:14,048 --> 00:45:15,416
<i>There's no one by that name</i>
<i>who works here</i>

694
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:18,285
<i>and he certainly</i>
<i>wouldn't have had a gray truck.</i>

695
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:23,958
Okay.

696
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:26,493
All right. Thank you.

697
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:38,239
See Chaplain Pete think
that was an angel
that brought me here.

698
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,642
I think so too.

699
00:45:41,208 --> 00:45:43,344
I mean they never
had a Claude Anderson.

700
00:45:43,477 --> 00:45:46,213
Saw the man once,
never saw him again.

701
00:45:46,648 --> 00:45:48,749
And they for sure
didn't have any gray trucks.

702
00:45:49,149 --> 00:45:52,086
I'd like to talk
a little bit about race.

703
00:45:52,853 --> 00:45:56,790
For a mostly
white church to be doing this,

704
00:45:56,924 --> 00:46:00,327
I'm, I'm curious
about how you've been treated.

705
00:46:00,461 --> 00:46:02,863
Like a king, Ms. Brandi.

706
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:09,103
The September 6th meeting

707
00:46:09,236 --> 00:46:10,938
of the City Commission
is called to order.

708
00:46:11,405 --> 00:46:14,041
Let's stand for the pledge
and for the invocation.

709
00:46:17,646 --> 00:46:21,915
I pledge allegiance to the Flag
of the United States of America,

710
00:46:22,049 --> 00:46:24,418
and to the Republic
for which it stands,

711
00:46:24,552 --> 00:46:27,788
one nation under God,
indivisible,

712
00:46:27,921 --> 00:46:30,291
with liberty
and justice for all.

713
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:34,596
The first agenda
on the docket tonight

714
00:46:34,729 --> 00:46:36,397
is First Baptist, Leesburg,

715
00:46:36,531 --> 00:46:40,234
and the request for
a special exception use permit

716
00:46:40,367 --> 00:46:42,403
to purchase the Big Bass Motel

717
00:46:42,537 --> 00:46:45,873
to use as a shelter
for homeless families.

718
00:46:47,374 --> 00:46:50,978
Planning staff,
your observations
and recommendations, please.

719
00:46:53,047 --> 00:46:56,317
All the departments have
reviewed the application,

720
00:46:56,718 --> 00:46:59,219
gas, no comments,

721
00:46:59,353 --> 00:47:01,822
public works, no comments,

722
00:47:02,189 --> 00:47:04,759
electric, no comments,

723
00:47:05,192 --> 00:47:09,196
police, questions
on security and the homeless,

724
00:47:09,664 --> 00:47:12,433
planning, out of zoning approval

725
00:47:12,567 --> 00:47:14,868
can only be approved
with the issuance

726
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:17,471
of a special usage permit.

727
00:47:17,938 --> 00:47:20,207
Pastor, any comments
from the church?

728
00:47:20,675 --> 00:47:22,109
Uh, just, just a few.

729
00:47:32,286 --> 00:47:34,723
We realize our homeless feeding

730
00:47:34,855 --> 00:47:38,092
and drug rehabilitation programs
don't always match

731
00:47:38,626 --> 00:47:41,563
eye to eye
with the dreams and vision

732
00:47:41,995 --> 00:47:45,099
of the city planners
here in Leesburg.

733
00:47:47,401 --> 00:47:48,302
But...

734
00:47:50,304 --> 00:47:52,741
...we believe
they are closely aligned

735
00:47:52,873 --> 00:47:55,943
with the heart and mind of God.

736
00:47:57,712 --> 00:48:00,080
We feel the commission
needs to take note

737
00:48:00,214 --> 00:48:02,282
that in the middle
of a great recession,

738
00:48:02,416 --> 00:48:05,520
<i>that Florida has the highest</i>
<i>unemployment rate in the nation.</i>

739
00:48:05,653 --> 00:48:10,324
<i>And our county has the highest</i>
<i>unemployment rate in the state.</i>

740
00:48:11,024 --> 00:48:12,993
At this moment, right now,

741
00:48:13,394 --> 00:48:15,697
we are sitting on the pinnacle

742
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:19,233
of the unemployment problem
in the nation.

743
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,969
To not acknowledge that,

744
00:48:22,102 --> 00:48:24,338
it's, it's very shortsighted.

745
00:48:25,707 --> 00:48:28,877
Just today we received a call
from a family where both

746
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:32,179
the wife and the husband
lost their jobs

747
00:48:32,814 --> 00:48:33,981
in the same week.

748
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:37,451
Three kids, no backup

749
00:48:38,118 --> 00:48:39,353
and no place to go.

750
00:48:42,624 --> 00:48:45,459
We know this
isn't an end-all solution...

751
00:48:46,694 --> 00:48:47,995
...but it is a big step

752
00:48:48,663 --> 00:48:49,963
in the right direction.

753
00:48:54,134 --> 00:48:55,035
That is all.

754
00:48:55,737 --> 00:48:59,039
Okay. The commission
will hear from the public

755
00:48:59,173 --> 00:49:01,241
and anyone withstanding.

756
00:49:02,476 --> 00:49:06,246
Doreen Norris, 1440 Herndon St.

757
00:49:06,881 --> 00:49:09,116
Speaking for our neighborhood,
we don't think

758
00:49:09,249 --> 00:49:11,485
this is a good idea
in the least.

759
00:49:11,952 --> 00:49:15,456
We are only one block away.

760
00:49:16,089 --> 00:49:18,025
Just one block.

761
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:22,931
A-- And, and,
and while we understand

762
00:49:23,063 --> 00:49:24,732
that this is a very good thing

763
00:49:24,866 --> 00:49:26,668
that the church is doing,

764
00:49:27,234 --> 00:49:31,472
all right, we just feel
in our beautiful,

765
00:49:31,606 --> 00:49:34,809
recently-deemed-historical area

766
00:49:35,543 --> 00:49:38,546
that this is just not right

767
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,782
- to do to a neighbor.
- Yeah,

768
00:49:40,915 --> 00:49:42,483
- great-grandfather
ran the first...

769
00:49:42,617 --> 00:49:45,319
...bootlegging operation
in Leesburg.

770
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,054
-Seriously?
-Mm-hmm.

771
00:49:47,187 --> 00:49:49,223
Next please.

772
00:49:49,724 --> 00:49:52,092
- Hm.
- Don't judge.

773
00:49:52,226 --> 00:49:55,630
John Walderman,
Quality Auto Parts.

774
00:49:57,464 --> 00:50:03,136
Land of days, what is this
commission thinking about
that it's gotten this far?

775
00:50:04,137 --> 00:50:06,006
We've had monthly meetings
with the city

776
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:08,141
to d-- develop this corridor.

777
00:50:08,275 --> 00:50:12,514
Now you wanna put
a homeless center
right in the middle of it!

778
00:50:12,647 --> 00:50:15,082
- I hope you have more
brains than that.

779
00:50:15,215 --> 00:50:18,185
Yeah!

780
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:19,687
Come on, Marge.

781
00:50:20,722 --> 00:50:24,324
Marge Roberts, my husband
and I own Leesburg Pharmacy.

782
00:50:24,726 --> 00:50:27,294
The reason my husband
is not here,

783
00:50:27,427 --> 00:50:30,632
is that he's at our store
fending off the homeless.

784
00:50:31,164 --> 00:50:32,266
Every day...

785
00:50:33,066 --> 00:50:34,702
...the homeless,
they're panhandling

786
00:50:34,836 --> 00:50:36,538
and accosting our customers.

787
00:50:37,005 --> 00:50:38,272
If you vote for this...

788
00:50:39,007 --> 00:50:41,709
...you're only voting to worsen
in the problem in our city.

789
00:50:41,843 --> 00:50:44,077
Yeah.

790
00:50:44,979 --> 00:50:46,280
Next, please.

791
00:50:49,082 --> 00:50:52,587
Jerry, Jer-- Jerry Baker,
809 High Street.

792
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:56,958
One thing no one's mentioned
here is property values.

793
00:50:57,124 --> 00:51:00,695
Far as I'm concerned, ch--
churches are like parasites.

794
00:51:00,828 --> 00:51:02,997
They pay no property taxes

795
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:06,868
and the rest of us have,
have to carry the tax burden.
Isn't that right?

796
00:51:07,001 --> 00:51:08,435
You'll see it! You'll see it!

797
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:11,438
I got 45 signatures
right here, Mayor,

798
00:51:11,573 --> 00:51:14,609
against this proposal
from my neighborhood!

799
00:51:14,742 --> 00:51:16,410
Let's stop this!

800
00:51:21,448 --> 00:51:23,250
Trey Grantham,
King Developments.

801
00:51:23,383 --> 00:51:26,320
For the record,
we have a client interested
in purchasing the motel.

802
00:51:26,453 --> 00:51:28,623
They have a proposal tied
into the city's comp plan

803
00:51:28,756 --> 00:51:31,626
that would be an appropriate
use of the property.

804
00:51:31,759 --> 00:51:33,360
Have you talked
with a property owner?

805
00:51:33,795 --> 00:51:35,763
We have engaged
the Kapoor family.

806
00:51:35,897 --> 00:51:37,497
Uh, they are of course,
honoring the contract

807
00:51:37,632 --> 00:51:39,099
with the church
for the next few days,

808
00:51:39,232 --> 00:51:42,770
but our offer
is substantially higher.

809
00:51:42,904 --> 00:51:45,272
The family will accept our offer

810
00:51:45,405 --> 00:51:47,374
if the church is not able
to acquire the property

811
00:51:47,508 --> 00:51:49,544
or the City Commission

812
00:51:49,677 --> 00:51:51,813
denies the zoning variance.

813
00:51:52,914 --> 00:51:54,916
Well, I see
some others want to speak,

814
00:51:55,049 --> 00:51:59,020
but the commissioners
have a stack of, uh,
emails and letters

815
00:51:59,152 --> 00:52:00,788
in regards to this issue.

816
00:52:01,355 --> 00:52:04,291
Commission members,
what is your pleasure?

817
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,495
I move we table it.
Study the issue a bit further.

818
00:52:09,564 --> 00:52:11,032
I second that.
We don't even know

819
00:52:11,164 --> 00:52:13,668
if the church is gonna be able
to purchase the motel.

820
00:52:15,168 --> 00:52:18,472
I'd favor a development more
in line with our comp plan.

821
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:24,612
The motion is to table
this proposal

822
00:52:24,746 --> 00:52:27,481
until we see if the church
is able to move forward

823
00:52:27,615 --> 00:52:30,585
and we look
at our comp plan more closely.

824
00:52:31,151 --> 00:52:32,854
All in favor to postpone?

825
00:52:35,623 --> 00:52:36,624
Opposed?

826
00:52:38,158 --> 00:52:39,794
Okay, very good. With a,

827
00:52:39,927 --> 00:52:43,131
uh, five-to-zero vote
the proposal is postponed

828
00:52:43,263 --> 00:52:44,932
for city staff
to evaluate this more

829
00:52:45,066 --> 00:52:48,301
in relationship
to the development
in the city comp plan,

830
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:50,270
and to see whether First Baptist

831
00:52:50,404 --> 00:52:53,808
will actually be able
to purchase the motel.

832
00:52:54,709 --> 00:52:56,144
Meeting adjourned.

833
00:53:02,083 --> 00:53:03,785
Welcome to Lake County.

834
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:07,287
Well, if your faith is
supposed to move mountains,

835
00:53:07,421 --> 00:53:08,790
I recommend a steam shovel.

836
00:53:08,923 --> 00:53:11,125
This is not looking good.

837
00:53:11,526 --> 00:53:14,862
Well, encouragement
at every corner.

838
00:53:15,797 --> 00:53:17,665
-Let's regroup.
-Yeah.

839
00:53:25,305 --> 00:53:27,642
<i>Cecil, you all right, man?</i>

840
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,384
<i>Cecil, you all right, man?</i>

841
00:53:37,852 --> 00:53:39,921
Like you swallowed
a handful of stress beans.

842
00:53:40,822 --> 00:53:42,389
Yeah. I'm fine.

843
00:53:48,428 --> 00:53:50,397
Hello, Cec. Let's go.

844
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:55,670
Come on.

845
00:53:57,905 --> 00:54:00,007
First fishing trip
with the pastors.

846
00:54:00,508 --> 00:54:02,375
We'll try not to disappoint.

847
00:54:03,511 --> 00:54:07,115
A report said
that the fish are probably
all up and down channel lakes.

848
00:54:07,247 --> 00:54:08,716
So we are gonna get them.

849
00:54:10,651 --> 00:54:12,419
This is gonna be a good time.

850
00:54:18,492 --> 00:54:20,360
All right.

851
00:54:20,494 --> 00:54:22,897
Time to go knock them dead.

852
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:25,398
Grab that cooler,
uh, behind you there.

853
00:54:26,033 --> 00:54:27,702
I got mine. All right.

854
00:54:31,606 --> 00:54:33,273
Right behind the seat.

855
00:54:38,012 --> 00:54:38,980
Hey, hey.

856
00:54:41,414 --> 00:54:42,583
Where you guys been?

857
00:54:43,184 --> 00:54:45,653
Two boats are already out
of their spot by the spillway.

858
00:54:45,787 --> 00:54:48,656
Bait shop was stacked.
Got here as soon as we could.

859
00:54:49,023 --> 00:54:50,958
Well, hey, we ain't waiting
any longer. Let's go.

860
00:54:51,092 --> 00:54:53,528
- All right.
- Cecil, come on!

861
00:54:53,661 --> 00:54:55,462
We playing this trip around you.

862
00:54:56,664 --> 00:55:00,701
Come on, Cecil!
That cooler's not gonna
put itself in the boat.

863
00:55:02,236 --> 00:55:04,705
You know, maybe he's not
used to being around
certifiables like y'all.

864
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:06,874
Says the guy...

865
00:55:12,947 --> 00:55:14,381
Come on, Cecil!

866
00:55:14,782 --> 00:55:16,884
Cecil.

867
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,862
Cecil, you all right, man?
What's going on?

868
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:39,674
I'm gonna go che--
check on him real quick.

869
00:55:44,645 --> 00:55:45,913
Hey, Cec, are you okay?

870
00:55:46,848 --> 00:55:48,883
Uh, hey, you guys
go on ahead, okay?

871
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:50,751
Just bring the gear
by my place later.

872
00:55:50,885 --> 00:55:53,453
- I'm gonna get Cecil back.
- All right. Take care.

873
00:55:54,522 --> 00:55:55,723
Hey Cecil, you--

874
00:55:56,224 --> 00:55:57,490
Are you okay, man?

875
00:56:02,429 --> 00:56:03,898
Y-- You afraid of the water?

876
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,702
A-- Alligators or...

877
00:56:09,003 --> 00:56:10,972
Why won't we go grab
a cup of coffee?

878
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,948
Cherokee saying...

879
00:56:22,516 --> 00:56:24,417
..."If you listen
to the whispers...

880
00:56:25,887 --> 00:56:27,955
...you don't have
to listen to the screams".

881
00:56:31,325 --> 00:56:32,827
I see the screams.

882
00:56:34,729 --> 00:56:36,597
Would you like
to share the whispers?

883
00:56:38,532 --> 00:56:40,534
You afraid of the water?

884
00:56:50,011 --> 00:56:51,012
White men.

885
00:56:55,983 --> 00:56:59,452
I don't trust any group
of white men.

886
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:08,529
You're afraid
of three white pastors?

887
00:57:10,097 --> 00:57:12,066
I mean, I've had people
walk out on my preaching before,

888
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:15,569
-but never
from a free fishing trip.
-Nothing personal.

889
00:57:18,506 --> 00:57:19,774
It ain't even you.

890
00:57:21,075 --> 00:57:24,578
I don't trust
white guys, period.

891
00:57:28,983 --> 00:57:30,751
Cec, my man.

892
00:57:31,552 --> 00:57:34,555
<i>Really didn't wanna</i>
<i>be out too late that night.</i>

893
00:57:40,094 --> 00:57:42,997
- You got lot in store
for you tonight.
- Yeah, man.

894
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,732
Got some of that new stuff
in from Columbia,

895
00:57:44,865 --> 00:57:46,701
make you think
you can fly there.

896
00:57:47,168 --> 00:57:48,970
<i>Tried to tell them</i>
<i>I just got a job</i>

897
00:57:49,103 --> 00:57:51,105
<i>and had to be there</i>
<i>at 6:00 in the morning.</i>

898
00:57:52,206 --> 00:57:53,607
<i>But they insisted.</i>

899
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:56,410
Huh, it's your call man.

900
00:57:56,544 --> 00:57:58,379
But tonight,
we're gonna light it up.

901
00:57:58,512 --> 00:58:00,247
<i>It ain't like</i>
<i>they had to pull my arm off.</i>

902
00:58:00,381 --> 00:58:04,185
<i>I kind of wanted to go.</i>
<i>So I told them, "Let's go."</i>

903
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:06,153
And for you, my brother...

904
00:58:07,054 --> 00:58:09,390
...we're gonna introduce you
to Charice.

905
00:58:09,523 --> 00:58:12,226
Ooh, yeah, Charice.

906
00:58:13,627 --> 00:58:15,997
<i>Plus I wanted</i>
<i>to meet their Charice.</i>

907
00:59:15,723 --> 00:59:17,925
Where this Charice at, man?
- What you mean?

908
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:19,226
- That's here.
- I mean, it's here.

909
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,028
We're meeting in here?

910
00:59:21,162 --> 00:59:22,063
Yeah.

911
00:59:23,864 --> 00:59:26,067
Y'all convinced her to meet
y'all out here, that's--

912
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,836
Yes. She always
want be on the private jets.

913
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:30,905
Okay.

914
00:59:31,506 --> 00:59:32,706
That's okay, Cecil.

915
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,408
- You'll have fun.
- Yeah, man.

916
00:59:34,543 --> 00:59:35,976
Hey, Charice.

917
00:59:39,847 --> 00:59:41,682
She's around here somewhere.

918
00:59:58,567 --> 01:00:00,167
-Where did it go?
-I don't know.

919
01:00:00,968 --> 01:00:02,870
Why don't you go
look over there?

920
01:00:03,804 --> 01:00:05,773
- Come on, man.
- Okay.

921
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:31,892
Whoa, no! Oh, come on, man!

922
01:01:32,026 --> 01:01:33,595
No. No, come on, man.

923
01:01:38,567 --> 01:01:40,434
Let go!

924
01:01:48,577 --> 01:01:51,478
- Come on, Cecil.
- Let me go, man.

925
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:53,881
Let me go, man! Come on!

926
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,817
Come on, man! Come on.

927
01:01:56,951 --> 01:02:00,888
- I told you, you're gonna
have a good time here, Cecil.

928
01:02:25,513 --> 01:02:28,482
-What do you think?
Beginning to see this coming?
-Yeah, he does.

929
01:02:31,553 --> 01:02:34,221
Ugh, no. Come on.
What did I do, man?

930
01:02:36,591 --> 01:02:37,958
What did I do, man?

931
01:02:39,193 --> 01:02:40,562
I say, he is about done.

932
01:02:41,228 --> 01:02:42,863
We can just, uh,
throw him in the canal,

933
01:02:42,997 --> 01:02:44,064
leave him for the gators.

934
01:02:44,198 --> 01:02:45,799
One more.

935
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:47,669
All right. One more, one more.

936
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,275
Let's go.

937
01:03:57,371 --> 01:03:58,238
You know...

938
01:03:59,373 --> 01:04:01,442
...I wouldn't want to go
fishing with us either.

939
01:04:05,714 --> 01:04:07,247
When I got out that truck...

940
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:10,918
...saw them three guys
down there...

941
01:04:12,286 --> 01:04:14,421
...three white men
waiting on me like that...

942
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:19,159
...everything just came
flooding back.

943
01:04:21,128 --> 01:04:23,798
That's why I couldn't
bring myself to come
down there with you.

944
01:04:28,302 --> 01:04:30,070
You know,
Mr. Claude picked me up

945
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:32,172
and brought me back
to the Men's Center.

946
01:04:32,973 --> 01:04:34,408
That there was an angel.

947
01:04:36,611 --> 01:04:38,312
So really,
this is the first time

948
01:04:38,445 --> 01:04:40,147
I've even gotten in the vehicle

949
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,216
with a white man since then.

950
01:04:44,652 --> 01:04:46,053
I'm honored it was me.

951
01:04:54,428 --> 01:04:57,464
You know you're safe
here, right?

952
01:05:00,802 --> 01:05:02,002
Yeah.

953
01:05:04,138 --> 01:05:05,305
This home.

954
01:05:05,973 --> 01:05:07,107
I know it.

955
01:05:08,676 --> 01:05:09,577
Okay.

956
01:05:10,277 --> 01:05:12,379
Speaking of it,
let's get you home.

957
01:05:12,514 --> 01:05:15,382
And you know what? And if
you wanna talk about this more,

958
01:05:15,817 --> 01:05:17,284
another time we can.

959
01:05:18,385 --> 01:05:21,488
Mind if we don't say anything
to Chaplain Pete about this?

960
01:05:24,024 --> 01:05:25,259
It stays here.

961
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:37,672
- Hey, Cecil.
- Hey.

962
01:05:37,806 --> 01:05:38,972
Hey, thanks for coming out.

963
01:05:39,507 --> 01:05:41,543
-Glad to, Mr. Clark.
-Oh.

964
01:05:41,676 --> 01:05:43,944
You know, I'm always
looking for more work.

965
01:05:44,077 --> 01:05:45,112
Please just call me Cecil.

966
01:05:45,245 --> 01:05:48,015
Ah, can't do that.

967
01:05:48,482 --> 01:05:51,118
You know,
two handsome guys like us,

968
01:05:51,251 --> 01:05:52,419
people might confuse us.

969
01:05:52,554 --> 01:05:54,656
Yeah, folks might.

970
01:05:54,789 --> 01:05:56,056
Uh, would you like a bite?

971
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:57,458
Uh, no, no. I'm fine.

972
01:05:57,592 --> 01:05:59,527
I, I already ate over
at the Center.

973
01:05:59,661 --> 01:06:01,696
-Okay.
-But I rushed
right over 'cause, uh,

974
01:06:02,296 --> 01:06:05,232
-Pastor Cliff said
you wanted to talk with me.
-I do. I do.

975
01:06:05,365 --> 01:06:06,901
I know Ms. Louise
gave you some equipment

976
01:06:07,034 --> 01:06:09,069
to get you set up in
your lawn maintenance business.

977
01:06:09,203 --> 01:06:10,538
She sure enough did.

978
01:06:10,672 --> 01:06:12,707
I already got
a few lawns set up for me.

979
01:06:12,841 --> 01:06:15,543
Well, Cecil,
I admire initiative

980
01:06:15,677 --> 01:06:16,845
and a man that will work.

981
01:06:17,344 --> 01:06:19,279
That is the American way.

982
01:06:19,413 --> 01:06:22,416
There's a reason I have
a 50-foot American flag
flying outside.

983
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:28,021
I love this country,
and the opportunity that God
gave me to build this business.

984
01:06:28,489 --> 01:06:30,023
Mrs. Jackie and I
had been blessed

985
01:06:30,157 --> 01:06:32,660
far more than we ever imagined
when we first got married.

986
01:06:33,795 --> 01:06:35,830
But this business
is not just about me,

987
01:06:36,463 --> 01:06:38,499
but about helping others also.

988
01:06:39,266 --> 01:06:41,903
Pastor Cliff has told me
a little bit about your journey,

989
01:06:42,604 --> 01:06:46,073
and I'm all in for encouraging
a man on the upward path.

990
01:06:46,841 --> 01:06:49,076
Mrs. Jackie and I have
decided to give you

991
01:06:49,209 --> 01:06:51,579
your first truck
through Cecil Clark Chevrolet.

992
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,582
When you go outside,
the keys are waiting for you.

993
01:06:56,518 --> 01:06:59,086
That's it, Cecil.

994
01:06:59,219 --> 01:07:01,154
You're officially
in the lawn business.

995
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:07,227
You got to be kidding me.

996
01:07:18,973 --> 01:07:20,107
I...

997
01:07:24,278 --> 01:07:25,680
I don't know what to say.

998
01:07:29,984 --> 01:07:31,351
Mr. Cecil, that's...

999
01:07:32,286 --> 01:07:33,588
...by far...

1000
01:07:35,155 --> 01:07:37,357
...the nicest thing anybody,

1001
01:07:37,992 --> 01:07:39,293
Black or white...

1002
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:41,629
...ever done for me.

1003
01:07:43,798 --> 01:07:46,300
Listen, Cecil...

1004
01:07:51,438 --> 01:07:53,575
...Mrs. Jackie and I
have quit seeing color.

1005
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:59,013
I grew up in Alabama,
surrounded by racism.

1006
01:07:59,914 --> 01:08:03,483
But you know what?
My surroundings didn't determine
who I was gonna be.

1007
01:08:04,284 --> 01:08:06,086
I judge a man on his character.

1008
01:08:06,521 --> 01:08:10,290
And what he does, Black or
white, makes no nevermind to me.

1009
01:08:11,926 --> 01:08:14,428
Mrs. Jakie and I have
stopped seeing color,

1010
01:08:14,562 --> 01:08:19,000
and the opportunity
that God will let me see
all the colors in his world.

1011
01:08:19,132 --> 01:08:20,133
Oh, man.

1012
01:08:20,802 --> 01:08:22,269
You got me?

1013
01:08:26,473 --> 01:08:28,108
Yes, sir, Mr. Cecil.

1014
01:08:29,209 --> 01:08:30,143
Yeah, I got you.

1015
01:08:30,645 --> 01:08:32,513
Good.

1016
01:08:32,647 --> 01:08:34,649
Now, let's go look
at your new work truck.

1017
01:08:37,018 --> 01:08:38,118
Come on.

1018
01:08:40,354 --> 01:08:42,422
I hope you like blue.

1019
01:08:44,224 --> 01:08:46,126
Hey, Pastor,

1020
01:08:46,259 --> 01:08:47,629
I got something for you.

1021
01:08:49,463 --> 01:08:51,599
-You always got something
for me.
-Yeah, I know.

1022
01:08:51,733 --> 01:08:56,004
But... this time
I really got something for you.

1023
01:08:57,204 --> 01:09:01,509
That there is $300 for my
first job in the lawn business.

1024
01:09:02,275 --> 01:09:03,645
Yeah, God gets it first,

1025
01:09:04,177 --> 01:09:07,347
but we all got to give
if we think
we're gonna get this motel.

1026
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:13,888
Cecil, I can't tell you
how much this gift means.

1027
01:09:14,022 --> 01:09:15,422
Oh, my pleasure.

1028
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:19,226
When I was in need,
church invested in me.

1029
01:09:19,661 --> 01:09:21,495
I just wanna do the same thing.

1030
01:09:23,163 --> 01:09:24,464
When you, uh,

1031
01:09:24,966 --> 01:09:26,067
when you go home tonight,

1032
01:09:26,668 --> 01:09:29,070
I'd love for you
to read Luke 21.

1033
01:09:29,202 --> 01:09:32,073
There's a story about a woman
in there that I think
you'll find interesting.

1034
01:09:32,205 --> 01:09:35,275
Well, I'll do it.
Chaplain Pete done made me
the night watchman.

1035
01:09:35,409 --> 01:09:37,845
So, I got
plenty of time to read.

1036
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:39,246
Yeah.

1037
01:09:39,714 --> 01:09:42,382
-You have a good day, Pastor.
-You too, Cecil.

1038
01:09:58,331 --> 01:09:59,534
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Brandi.

1039
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:00,935
I'm on it.
The piece is finished.

1040
01:10:01,069 --> 01:10:03,437
I think you love it.
It really came together.

1041
01:10:03,571 --> 01:10:08,375
Great. I'm sure it did.
Listen, this is not
the standard get-it-in call.

1042
01:10:09,043 --> 01:10:11,512
Editorial says,
"Hold on the story for now."

1043
01:10:11,646 --> 01:10:13,915
No, you have to run it.

1044
01:10:14,347 --> 01:10:15,950
<i>You didn't wanna do this piece.</i>

1045
01:10:16,084 --> 01:10:18,886
Things change.
You have to run it tomorrow.

1046
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:20,688
No. Not a chance.

1047
01:10:20,822 --> 01:10:22,824
Best would be in back
a local and state.

1048
01:10:24,025 --> 01:10:25,626
Harry, don't do this.

1049
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:28,629
You have to publish
this tomorrow.

1050
01:10:29,262 --> 01:10:30,297
<i>Why tomorrow?</i>

1051
01:10:30,932 --> 01:10:33,167
Well, the City Commission
is having a vote

1052
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:35,703
and I want the community to know
what's really going on here.

1053
01:10:35,837 --> 01:10:39,306
It's a chance for the people
to see beyond their noses

1054
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:41,609
and, and really
make a difference.

1055
01:10:41,743 --> 01:10:42,777
Please.

1056
01:10:43,678 --> 01:10:45,079
All right. Well,
I can't guarantee anything,

1057
01:10:45,213 --> 01:10:48,015
but I'll run it up the flag pole
because you insist.

1058
01:10:48,381 --> 01:10:49,951
<i>Oh, that's all I can ask.</i>

1059
01:10:50,084 --> 01:10:51,519
All right, sweets, email it over

1060
01:10:51,652 --> 01:10:52,920
<i>and I'll take it into editorial</i>

1061
01:10:53,054 --> 01:10:54,555
<i>for a quick look</i>
<i>and final approval.</i>

1062
01:10:55,022 --> 01:10:57,324
Please make it happen?
You're the best.

1063
01:10:57,457 --> 01:11:00,327
<i>-Yeah. Well, tell it to my wife.</i>
-Sure.

1064
01:11:08,569 --> 01:11:10,705
And that was the last
part of it.

1065
01:11:10,838 --> 01:11:12,907
- Uh-oh. Y'all--
- Oh, Cecil.

1066
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,042
-Y'all--
-Come on in and have a seat.
Have a seat.

1067
01:11:15,176 --> 01:11:18,045
Y'all double teaming me. Am I--

1068
01:11:18,179 --> 01:11:21,281
-I ain't in trouble, am I?
-No, you're in big,
big time, big trouble.

1069
01:11:21,414 --> 01:11:22,817
Uh-oh.

1070
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:24,351
Listen, um,

1071
01:11:24,484 --> 01:11:26,120
Cecil, how would you
like to become

1072
01:11:26,554 --> 01:11:28,421
a teacher in the church?

1073
01:11:30,158 --> 01:11:32,093
I'm not sure I can.

1074
01:11:32,226 --> 01:11:33,628
I can barely read.

1075
01:11:34,796 --> 01:11:35,763
Plus, I...

1076
01:11:37,265 --> 01:11:38,933
I don't know when somebody
coming to the church

1077
01:11:39,066 --> 01:11:40,802
and say, "What that scoundrel
doing up there?"

1078
01:11:40,935 --> 01:11:44,304
Well,
i-- if the scripture is true

1079
01:11:44,437 --> 01:11:46,741
and, uh, and I believe it is,

1080
01:11:47,175 --> 01:11:48,142
then everything is,

1081
01:11:48,843 --> 01:11:51,145
Everything's forgiven.
It's in your past. It's gone.

1082
01:11:52,146 --> 01:11:55,616
Chaplin Pete and I
would like you to start up
a 12-step program.

1083
01:11:56,784 --> 01:11:58,451
Look, the most effective teacher
is someone

1084
01:11:58,586 --> 01:12:00,688
who has already
navigated successfully

1085
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:04,625
what they're teaching.
And, and we think
you'd be perfect.

1086
01:12:05,392 --> 01:12:08,162
Okay. Well, what would I do?

1087
01:12:08,296 --> 01:12:13,067
Well, you would just love them
and help them walk
the same journey you walked.

1088
01:12:14,268 --> 01:12:15,570
What do you say?

1089
01:12:17,505 --> 01:12:19,173
Well...

1090
01:12:19,307 --> 01:12:21,576
- I'm gonna have
to pray about that.

1091
01:12:21,709 --> 01:12:25,880
Well, you would also
be the first Black teacher
and leader...

1092
01:12:26,948 --> 01:12:30,450
...in the 152-year history
of this church.
It's about time.

1093
01:12:32,419 --> 01:12:34,822
- Hey, y'all quit looking at me
like that.

1094
01:12:34,956 --> 01:12:37,225
I'm keeping ready to run up
outta here, I'll tell you.

1095
01:12:37,357 --> 01:12:40,761
Think on it. Pray on it.
We think you'd be perfect.

1096
01:12:40,895 --> 01:12:42,630
- And you just let,
let me know in a few days.

1097
01:12:43,164 --> 01:12:46,234
Cecil, everything
you've been through,

1098
01:12:46,366 --> 01:12:48,502
God custom made you for this.

1099
01:13:12,727 --> 01:13:13,895
The funeral home is here.

1100
01:13:14,028 --> 01:13:15,796
Are you okay for them
to take her away?

1101
01:13:16,564 --> 01:13:17,698
Yes.

1102
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:40,655
Wait. Wait.

1103
01:13:41,454 --> 01:13:42,857
Just one second.

1104
01:13:52,033 --> 01:13:53,000
Okay.

1105
01:15:00,801 --> 01:15:01,969
Can I help you?

1106
01:15:03,437 --> 01:15:05,506
I just felt the need to pray.

1107
01:15:06,374 --> 01:15:07,675
College kids just left,

1108
01:15:08,175 --> 01:15:10,644
but I can open the chapel
if you need for a few minutes.

1109
01:15:11,312 --> 01:15:13,647
Look,
you can't imagine...

1110
01:15:14,515 --> 01:15:15,649
Come on in.

1111
01:16:06,734 --> 01:16:08,302
It's a good saying...

1112
01:16:10,438 --> 01:16:12,940
...right now it feels like
an impossibility.

1113
01:16:30,157 --> 01:16:32,726
Okay. It's been a while
since we've talked

1114
01:16:33,327 --> 01:16:35,663
and I'm here
because I need help.

1115
01:16:36,263 --> 01:16:37,665
I'm sorry.

1116
01:16:41,836 --> 01:16:44,405
This is the first time ever,

1117
01:16:44,539 --> 01:16:46,207
I'm gonna trust you.

1118
01:16:49,143 --> 01:16:50,177
I'm a mess.

1119
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:56,750
Well, now you commanded us
to take care
of widows and orphans...

1120
01:16:59,521 --> 01:17:00,955
...I'm trying.

1121
01:17:04,158 --> 01:17:06,327
I need about
a million dollars and...

1122
01:17:07,928 --> 01:17:10,164
...to change five commissioners.

1123
01:17:15,736 --> 01:17:16,904
Help me.

1124
01:17:27,648 --> 01:17:29,116
Thank you for a wonderful mother

1125
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:32,086
who did nothing
but love and support me.

1126
01:17:33,888 --> 01:17:35,089
Forgive me.

1127
01:17:35,723 --> 01:17:38,759
Forgive my... sarcasm.

1128
01:17:38,893 --> 01:17:41,428
Forgive my negative attitude
towards people

1129
01:17:41,563 --> 01:17:45,900
who I suppose
are doing the best they can.

1130
01:17:47,801 --> 01:17:52,239
I have a brother who's
killing himself in a bottle.

1131
01:17:52,907 --> 01:17:54,742
I've done everything I can.

1132
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:58,179
Could you help him?

1133
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:05,252
I just wanna say...

1134
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:08,122
...I see something
different here...

1135
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:11,593
...and my story needs
to be published on time.

1136
01:18:11,725 --> 01:18:12,960
But it's not about me anymore.

1137
01:18:13,093 --> 01:18:15,429
It's about people who need help.

1138
01:18:17,164 --> 01:18:18,098
So...

1139
01:18:20,034 --> 01:18:22,436
So, please...

1140
01:18:28,342 --> 01:18:29,343
Please.

1141
01:18:30,311 --> 01:18:31,312
Please.

1142
01:18:38,352 --> 01:18:39,286
Please.

1143
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:50,831
Please.

- "To Senior Editor,

...in a small
Central Florida town,

1151
01:19:37,144 --> 01:19:39,446
I have a uncovered that story.

1152
01:19:41,448 --> 01:19:46,954
This story is not only about
a desperate need, but was...

1153
01:19:47,888 --> 01:19:51,191
...also, for me, a voyage of...

1154
01:19:53,193 --> 01:19:56,096
...discovery of who I am...

1155

- Oh, not so fast.

Pete just called
and Channel 7 out of Orlando,

1166
01:20:50,017 --> 01:20:52,886
is across the street and wants
to do an interview with you.

1167
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:54,789
-What?
-Yeah! There's an article

1168
01:20:54,922 --> 01:20:56,624
in the paper. I haven't seen it
yet, but apparently,

1169
01:20:56,758 --> 01:20:58,992
there is a front page article
in the <i>Sentinel</i>

1170
01:20:59,126 --> 01:21:02,329
about the motel project
and Channel 7 wants
to do a segment now

1171
01:21:02,463 --> 01:21:04,532
to headline
on the six o'clock news tonight.

1172
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:09,203
Oh, and you have 57 messages and
counting, all about the motel.

1173
01:21:11,105 --> 01:21:14,274
-Uh, uh, could you go get me
a copy of the paper, please?
-Mm-hmm.

1174
01:21:14,408 --> 01:21:15,909
And I'll, and I'll read it
when I get back.

Okay.

-Really?

Uh, yes, ma'am.
We are trying to buy it.

Good.

1188
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:55,983
Here are blankets, comforters

01:22:03,591 --> 01:22:05,459
- Wow.
- This is great.

1193
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:09,096
-All right.
-Oh, maybe come back the rest.

1194
01:22:09,229 --> 01:22:11,432
-Oh, yeah, I will.
See you in a bit.
-Run them into the office.

1195
01:22:11,566 --> 01:22:13,000
-Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you so much.
-Oh, my pleasure.

1196
01:22:13,133 --> 01:22:15,035
-Thank you.
-W-- What?

1197
01:22:15,169 --> 01:22:17,772
Pastor, Pastor. Here.

1198
01:22:18,205 --> 01:22:21,776
I read the article
on the front page today

1199
01:22:21,910 --> 01:22:23,377
and here is a check.

1200
01:22:24,445 --> 01:22:26,681
And I will be back next month
with another one.

1201
01:22:27,214 --> 01:22:29,784
-Janet, I'm sp-- speechless.
-You know what?

1202
01:22:30,317 --> 01:22:34,889
After reading
what that <i>Sentinel</i> writer
wrote about those kids,

1203
01:22:35,022 --> 01:22:37,224
I'm gonna do everything I can

1204
01:22:37,357 --> 01:22:42,095
to treat those homeless children
just like they were
my very own kids.

1205
01:22:43,263 --> 01:22:44,331
God bless you.

1206
01:22:44,465 --> 01:22:45,999
-God bless you.
-Thank you.

1207
01:22:46,133 --> 01:22:47,334
You must be the pastor.

1208
01:22:47,468 --> 01:22:48,937
-Y-- Yes, sir. That's me.
-That's great.

1209
01:22:49,069 --> 01:22:51,205
Listen, Lake County Chopper
is gonna be kicking in.

1210
01:22:51,338 --> 01:22:52,674
We got 5K for you.

1211
01:22:52,807 --> 01:22:54,576
And when the rest
of the brothers hear about it,

1212
01:22:54,709 --> 01:22:56,410
you can count on us
for some more.

1213
01:22:57,444 --> 01:22:58,746
That is amazing.

1214
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,882
-Thank you.
-No, glad we could help. Yeah.

1215
01:23:01,014 --> 01:23:02,082
God bless.

1216
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:03,685
Pastor Lea,

1217
01:23:03,818 --> 01:23:05,452
Wow, what a unique idea,

1218
01:23:05,587 --> 01:23:07,555
buying a motel or the homeless.

1219
01:23:07,689 --> 01:23:09,691
Yeah, I, I guess
that doesn't happen every day.

1220
01:23:10,357 --> 01:23:11,458
What is your motivation?

1221
01:23:11,926 --> 01:23:14,127
Well, our founder
has some pretty clear words

1222
01:23:14,261 --> 01:23:16,631
for us about, um,
those who have less.

1223
01:23:16,764 --> 01:23:19,233
And, and during this recession
it's these homeless families,

1224
01:23:19,366 --> 01:23:21,836
they, they are certainly
the ones who have less.

1225
01:23:22,436 --> 01:23:24,572
Kind of like baby Jesus
needing a place to stay?

1226
01:23:24,706 --> 01:23:27,809
Yeah, that's, that's
one way to look at it, yes.

1227
01:23:27,942 --> 01:23:29,476
Well, I am so enthused.

1228
01:23:29,611 --> 01:23:31,513
Just since our camera crew
started setting up,

1229
01:23:31,646 --> 01:23:33,948
- I've seen several
donations that...

1230
01:23:34,081 --> 01:23:35,817
...for lack of a better word,
drive in.

1231
01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:37,652
Yes, ma'am. It's incredible.

1232
01:23:37,785 --> 01:23:40,755
It, every, every penny is going
towards buying the motel.

1233
01:23:40,889 --> 01:23:44,324
Um, and we, we need
$600,000 by next week.

1234
01:23:44,726 --> 01:23:46,794
Well, the writer beautifully
described the project

1235
01:23:46,928 --> 01:23:48,963
and told the community
to get off their wallets

1236
01:23:49,096 --> 01:23:52,600
and do something
for homeless children
and families in this recession.

1237
01:23:52,734 --> 01:23:55,570
This is
truly inspirational, Pastor.

1238
01:23:55,703 --> 01:23:58,506
A 180 degree turn
from the church fraud story
we ran last month.

1239
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:02,010
-Yeah.
-Shannon Moser reporting
live in Leesburg.

1240
01:24:02,142 --> 01:24:04,344
This story,
we will be following.

1241
01:24:06,079 --> 01:24:07,515
- Pastor Lea?
- Yes.

1242
01:24:07,649 --> 01:24:09,182
-Pastor Paul from All Saints.
-Oh!

1243
01:24:09,316 --> 01:24:10,785
- Great to see you.
- Same here.

1244
01:24:10,919 --> 01:24:12,921
Interesting timing
on the article today.

1245
01:24:13,053 --> 01:24:15,790
We had our parish missions
council meeting this morning.

1246
01:24:15,924 --> 01:24:19,326
The, uh,
article in the paper was

1247
01:24:19,459 --> 01:24:21,295
our main topic of conversation.

1248
01:24:21,663 --> 01:24:23,430
Well, the council was unanimous.

1249
01:24:23,565 --> 01:24:26,968
Here's $25,000 to assist
with the down payment.

1250
01:24:27,936 --> 01:24:30,437
- I, I'm speechless.
- Don't be.

1251
01:24:30,572 --> 01:24:34,141
We share your burden
for the homeless
in our community so...

1252
01:24:35,677 --> 01:24:36,811
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1253
01:24:36,945 --> 01:24:37,946
Take care. Have a great day.

1254
01:24:38,078 --> 01:24:39,112
Wow.

1255
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:55,697
Barry Jones, BB&T,
regional vice president.

1256
01:24:55,830 --> 01:24:58,465
You have no idea
how glad I am to have found you.

1257
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:01,101
-W--
-When <i>60 Minutes</i> ran the special

1258
01:25:01,234 --> 01:25:03,236
on homelessness
in Central Florida,

1259
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:06,173
our executive team decided
to adopt Central Florida

1260
01:25:06,306 --> 01:25:08,475
as a focus for our company
and employees.

1261
01:25:08,610 --> 01:25:12,714
When we saw the piece
in the <i>Sentinel</i> today,
we knew we had found our cause.

1262
01:25:12,847 --> 01:25:15,683
So we estimate
it's gonna take you about
a quarter of a million dollars

1263
01:25:15,817 --> 01:25:19,319
in the initial renovations
when you buy the building.
This check should cover that,

1264
01:25:19,453 --> 01:25:21,923
plus we'll be doing more
as the project progresses.

1265
01:25:22,289 --> 01:25:24,092
Plus we will be offering you

1266
01:25:24,224 --> 01:25:27,227
our lowest commercial loan rate
if you need it for the mortgage.

1267
01:25:27,662 --> 01:25:29,564
I would like to stay longer,
but I got to get back.

1268
01:25:29,697 --> 01:25:31,766
But my assistant will be
following up with you.

1269
01:25:32,299 --> 01:25:33,501
Have a nice day.

1270
01:25:36,704 --> 01:25:37,672
Wha--

1271
01:25:40,642 --> 01:25:43,044
- Do you believe
just what happened?

1272
01:25:43,611 --> 01:25:46,313
I think I just changed banks.

1273
01:25:46,446 --> 01:25:47,682
You got that right.

1274
01:25:48,883 --> 01:25:49,917
Wow.

1275
01:25:50,051 --> 01:25:51,184
Wow.

1276
01:25:55,455 --> 01:25:57,091
Mm. Here you go.

1277
01:25:57,224 --> 01:25:59,159
You have some visitors.

1278
01:26:04,532 --> 01:26:05,967
Well, this is either, uh,

1279
01:26:06,601 --> 01:26:09,436
very good news or very bad news.

1280
01:26:11,271 --> 01:26:12,573
You want the good news?

1281
01:26:13,007 --> 01:26:15,409
Or the very good news?

1282
01:26:16,276 --> 01:26:18,079
Uh, I, I'll take the former.

1283
01:26:18,579 --> 01:26:21,314
Steve Pullum,
personal, uh, representative

1284
01:26:21,448 --> 01:26:23,584
for Bernice Jefko
and her estate.

1285
01:26:23,718 --> 01:26:26,286
Uh, nice to meet you, Steve.

1286
01:26:27,055 --> 01:26:28,923
Mrs. Jefko was adamant

1287
01:26:29,057 --> 01:26:31,693
about what she wanted done
with her estate.

1288
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:34,494
And as, uh, as most people know

1289
01:26:35,029 --> 01:26:38,099
she was a quiet
but a very determined woman.

1290
01:26:38,633 --> 01:26:41,636
Well, I, I honestly
didn't know her that well.

1291
01:26:42,269 --> 01:26:46,040
I mean, whenever
she could make it to church,
she would always, sort of,

1292
01:26:46,741 --> 01:26:49,177
slide in the background
and she was always very quiet.

1293
01:26:49,544 --> 01:26:50,878
But she was always smiling.

1294
01:26:51,012 --> 01:26:54,182
Well, she may have been
quiet in her living,

1295
01:26:54,615 --> 01:26:57,151
but she was not quiet
in her giving.

1296
01:26:57,819 --> 01:26:59,654
Bernice was a dairy farmer and,

1297
01:26:59,787 --> 01:27:01,856
although she never made
what you'd call

1298
01:27:02,355 --> 01:27:04,992
big money,
what she did have was land.

1299
01:27:05,526 --> 01:27:06,694
And lots of it.

1300
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,730
And may I add,

1301
01:27:09,163 --> 01:27:10,598
very valuable land.

1302
01:27:23,644 --> 01:27:24,912
That is correct.

1303
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:27,314
And it is legitimate.

1304
01:27:27,949 --> 01:27:30,383
When she found out that you
gave up building your sanctuary

1305
01:27:30,518 --> 01:27:32,620
to help the needy people
in this community...

1306
01:27:34,188 --> 01:27:35,690
...it made a big impact on her.

1307
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:37,357
She never forgot it.

1308
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:40,494
Her will

1309
01:27:40,862 --> 01:27:42,864
leaves you several
million dollars' worth

1310
01:27:42,997 --> 01:27:45,233
of prime real estate.

1311
01:27:45,365 --> 01:27:48,268
So you can both
build your church...

1312
01:27:49,269 --> 01:27:50,772
...and expand your operation.

1313
01:27:51,539 --> 01:27:52,974
She was of sound mind

1314
01:27:53,373 --> 01:27:55,408
and at full
testamentary capacity

1315
01:27:56,010 --> 01:27:57,879
even though
she was dying of cancer.

1316
01:28:03,151 --> 01:28:04,886
You need to read your own sign.

1317
01:28:08,689 --> 01:28:10,725
Now, there's still a lot of work

1318
01:28:10,858 --> 01:28:13,393
that my office
has to do with her estate,

1319
01:28:13,928 --> 01:28:16,097
but I wanted to come here
and tell you personally

1320
01:28:16,898 --> 01:28:20,701
about her request
and, and, in light of the,
in light of the article.

1321
01:28:24,105 --> 01:28:25,840
Wow.

1322
01:28:47,394 --> 01:28:48,629
I never,

1323
01:28:49,429 --> 01:28:50,832
ever, ever,

1324
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:52,533
never ever thought

1325
01:28:52,667 --> 01:28:55,402
that my religion-mocking sister

1326
01:28:55,536 --> 01:28:57,104
would be driving me

1327
01:28:57,238 --> 01:28:58,639
and dropping me off...

1328
01:28:59,607 --> 01:29:00,842
...at a church.

1329
01:29:01,809 --> 01:29:04,812
Well, I never thought
I'd see you be sober.

1330
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:08,516
But I can see that for you now.

1331
01:29:10,383 --> 01:29:12,753
Do we gotta?

1332
01:29:14,155 --> 01:29:16,423
Yeah, you gotta.

1333
01:29:17,191 --> 01:29:19,994
Just remember I'm the executor
of mom's estate

1334
01:29:20,127 --> 01:29:22,597
so I determine
where every dollar goes.

1335
01:29:28,002 --> 01:29:30,004
Listen, this place
will help you.

1336
01:29:30,905 --> 01:29:32,506
I've seen it with my own eyes.

1337
01:29:35,375 --> 01:29:36,677
It's gonna be awesome.

1338
01:29:39,213 --> 01:29:40,413
Come here.

1339
01:29:42,884 --> 01:29:43,885
Good bye.

1340
01:29:44,285 --> 01:29:46,453
-I love you.
-I love you.

1341
01:29:50,992 --> 01:29:52,260
All right.

1342
01:29:53,027 --> 01:29:55,963
-I'm Cecil.
-Hi. I'm Tony.

1343
01:29:56,564 --> 01:29:57,798
Nice to meet you, Tony.

1344
01:29:58,465 --> 01:29:59,634
Welcome to home!

1345
01:30:00,635 --> 01:30:01,769
Come on, man.

1346
01:30:30,430 --> 01:30:31,766
Are you excited?

1347
01:30:37,505 --> 01:30:38,739
You guys ready?

1348
01:31:00,493 --> 01:31:02,029
Welcome to your new home.

1349
01:31:06,367 --> 01:31:08,402
-Thank you!
-Don't thank me.

1350
01:31:08,536 --> 01:31:10,204
-Thank her.
-Oh.

1351
01:31:10,738 --> 01:31:13,074
Congratulations.

1352
01:31:39,066 --> 01:31:39,967
Hey.

1353
01:31:40,501 --> 01:31:42,103
-Hey, hotdog.
<i>-What's up?</i>

1354
01:31:42,236 --> 01:31:43,237
You're up.

1355
01:31:43,371 --> 01:31:44,271
Your piece on the Samaritan Inn

1356
01:31:44,405 --> 01:31:45,406
lit up the scoreboard.

1357
01:31:45,539 --> 01:31:47,174
Few things for you.

1358
01:31:47,608 --> 01:31:48,743
Thing one,

1359
01:31:49,210 --> 01:31:50,277
<i>The Post</i> called.

1360
01:31:50,411 --> 01:31:51,879
As a follow-up
to the <i>60 Minutes</i> piece,

1361
01:31:52,013 --> 01:31:53,848
they want to do
a series on homelessness,

1362
