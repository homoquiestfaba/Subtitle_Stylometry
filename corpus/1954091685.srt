1
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,919
[man 1 speaking in Arabic]
What happened?

2
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,400
- [man 2] The lights went out.
- [man 1] Why?

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,800
[man 3] This is normal.

4
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,479
[man 1] The lights are
out all over the world.

5
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,959
The lights are
out all over Egypt.

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,639
Everything is like this,
it's not just the electricity.

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,079
Electricity is the least
of our problems.

8
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,240
And all the little kids

9
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:45,399
in the streets say,
"Turn the lights back on, man."

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,759
Who is the "man"?

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,100
The man who's responsible

12
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:52,439
for switching the electricity
back on.

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,440
The regime.

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,119
- [man 1] Are you recording?
- [man 2] Yes.

15
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,000
- Really recording?

16
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:03,879
- Yes.

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,680
OK. Do as you like.

18
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,720
- [Ahmed speaking in Arabic] - Let me
tell you how this whole story began.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,240
Egypt was living
without dignity.

20
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,120
Injustice existed
everywhere.

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,720
Before the revolution,

22
00:01:25,721 --> 00:01:27,799
I lived from one job
to the next.

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,879
I started working
when I was eight years old.

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,439
In fifth grade, I used
to pay my school tuition

25
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,599
by selling lemons
in the street.

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,520
There was no hope for a
better future in this country.

27
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,960
We were tied down by

28
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:54,200
an unjust regime and
its dictator.

29
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,199
Mubarak was the head
of the regime

30
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,319
that forced us to live for
30 years under emergency law.

31
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,039
I lived my entire life
under Mubarak's injustice.

32
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:12,039
The regime always
worked against the people.

33
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,060
They would torture,

34
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:16,079
electrocute, beat the
shit out of people.

35
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,119
No one dared to speak
about politics.

36
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,439
Politics was for
the regime only.

37
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,079
[groaning on video]

38
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,880
Oh, my God, people.

39
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,439
We want to go
to Tahrir Square.

40
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,120
If we have any dignity and

41
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:41,799
want to live as humans
in this country,

42
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,959
then we have to
go to the streets.

43
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,279
We will go down and demand
our fundamental human rights.

44
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,560
I am going down and I will say

45
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:51,840
"no" to corruption, "no" to
this regime.

46
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,260
- [Ahmed] I went to the

47
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:56,880
streets.
- [whistling]

48
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,919
I found everyone around me

49
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,159
- felt just as I did.
- [crowd chanting in Arabic]

50
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,680
[chanting] The people
want to end corruption!

51
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,199
[chanting] Peaceful!

52
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,199
[chaotic shouts]

53
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,959
[Ahmed] The police tried to
divide us with all they had.

54
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,759
- [shouting]
- [gunfire]

55
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,839
[sirens wailing]

56
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,240
[chatter in Arabic]

57
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,879
- [Ahmed] People got angry...
- [indistinct shouts]

58
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,880
- ...and broke their fears.
- [rocks banging]

59
00:00:00,103 --> 00:00:04,302
We were all present.
We were one hand.

60
00:00:04,303 --> 00:00:05,582
[crowd] One hand!

61
00:00:05,583 --> 00:00:07,062
One hand!

62
00:00:07,063 --> 00:00:08,463
One hand!

63
00:00:10,783 --> 00:00:15,022
We will fill the world
with our poetry.

64
00:00:15,023 --> 00:00:17,582
Our words will
stand in the Square.

65
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:21,502
And they will be
like bullets in this war.

66
00:00:21,503 --> 00:00:25,502
- Revolution until victory!
- [crowd chanting]

67
00:00:25,503 --> 00:00:28,182
Revolution on
every street in Egypt!

68
00:00:28,183 --> 00:00:29,862
Leave, Mubarak!

69
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,983
[crowd chanting]

70
00:00:34,543 --> 00:00:37,143
[Ahmed] This is when we

71
00:00:37,144 --> 00:00:39,742
realised that people are
the true power.

72
00:00:39,743 --> 00:00:42,942
Every five seconds,
thousands join the sit-in.

73
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:47,383
We won't leave the Square
until our demands are met.

74
00:00:52,263 --> 00:00:54,142
We've never
had our rights.

75
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:58,342
Finally, we have this piece
of land to call our own

76
00:00:58,343 --> 00:01:01,902
and to claim
our rights on.

77
00:01:01,903 --> 00:01:03,062
And now, it's ours.

78
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,102
It's not too much
to ask for.

79
00:01:05,103 --> 00:01:06,622
Tahrir Square is nothing

80
00:01:06,623 --> 00:01:10,223
compared to the thousands
of acres they stole.

81
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:13,143
Tea, anyone?

82
00:01:13,703 --> 00:01:15,063
Tea, anyone?

83
00:01:17,263 --> 00:01:18,942
Magdy.

84
00:01:18,943 --> 00:01:21,382
I told you we'd have
some tea together.

85
00:01:21,383 --> 00:01:23,182
You, too, have some tea.

86
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:26,502
If I were to talk on behalf
of some of the Islamists...

87
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:30,262
Who's to say who's
an example of Islam?

88
00:01:30,263 --> 00:01:33,662
The ideas we've
adopted since the start

89
00:01:33,663 --> 00:01:36,382
of the revolution
are beautiful.

90
00:01:36,383 --> 00:01:38,622
The idea that
we're one society.

91
00:01:38,623 --> 00:01:41,302
To imagine that one day I would
be standing in Tahrir Square

92
00:01:41,303 --> 00:01:44,423
- in solidarity with all these
- people, I could never have imagined it.

93
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:46,363
[woman speaking English]

94
00:01:46,364 --> 00:01:48,302
At first, we were just
sleeping on newspapers.

95
00:01:48,303 --> 00:01:50,542
And we didn't have any
blankets, only a few.

96
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:51,623
And only a few

97
00:01:51,624 --> 00:01:52,702
people slept in.

98
00:01:52,703 --> 00:01:54,823
Now, it's turning into some

99
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,942
community. It's more tents.

100
00:01:56,943 --> 00:01:59,263
Relationships are
becoming very strong.

101
00:02:00,423 --> 00:02:02,903
We're waiting for him
to resign tonight.

102
00:02:03,863 --> 00:02:05,502
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

103
00:02:05,503 --> 00:02:07,942
I don't know,
we're all very nervous.

104
00:02:07,943 --> 00:02:10,083
- [speaking in Arabic]

105
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:12,222
- [in Arabic] I don't have any
cigarettes left.

106
00:02:12,223 --> 00:02:13,463
Take this one.

107
00:02:16,263 --> 00:02:17,742
[speaks English]
I'm just waiting for the speech.

108
00:02:17,743 --> 00:02:19,462
You don't normally
get so much time

109
00:02:19,463 --> 00:02:21,742
to try and work out where
you're going to be standing

110
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:23,702
when something
historic happens,

111
00:02:23,703 --> 00:02:25,903
and the bastard
is making us wait.

112
00:02:27,623 --> 00:02:29,703
- [Anderson Cooper]
- The protestors I talked to before I left

113
00:02:29,706 --> 00:02:32,062
were very concerned
literally for their lives

114
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:34,142
if they left that Square.

115
00:02:34,143 --> 00:02:37,543
- The Secret Police, - the intelligence
apparatus is still in place,

116
00:02:37,546 --> 00:02:38,883
still taking people and could

117
00:02:38,884 --> 00:02:40,222
pick them off one by one

118
00:02:40,223 --> 00:02:41,043
when they return

119
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:41,862
to their homes.

120
00:02:41,863 --> 00:02:42,683
Khalid, you're

121
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:43,502
a famous actor.

122
00:02:43,503 --> 00:02:45,423
Do you worry about talking

123
00:02:45,424 --> 00:02:47,342
like you have been?

124
00:02:47,343 --> 00:02:48,443
About being in

125
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:49,542
with the protestors?

126
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:50,803
Do you worry that

127
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,063
you could be targeted?

128
00:02:54,223 --> 00:02:56,182
Well, I...

129
00:02:56,183 --> 00:02:57,143
I don't care.

130
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,102
[chuckles]

131
00:02:58,103 --> 00:02:59,363
I mean, I know

132
00:02:59,364 --> 00:03:00,622
why I'm here

133
00:03:00,623 --> 00:03:01,803
and I know why

134
00:03:01,804 --> 00:03:02,982
I want to be here.

135
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,702
I mean, I come from...

136
00:03:04,703 --> 00:03:06,903
- I come from three generations
- who've been fighting

137
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:08,283
for social reform and political

138
00:03:08,284 --> 00:03:09,662
freedoms in this country.

139
00:03:09,663 --> 00:03:12,222
And here we have
the discourse of democracy,

140
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:15,942
of freedom, of social justice,
of political reform

141
00:03:15,943 --> 00:03:19,262
being changed in the
Middle East for all of us.

142
00:03:19,263 --> 00:03:22,222
And I'm extremely proud
to be here for those reasons.

143
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:24,062
[speaking in Arabic]
God be with you.

144
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:27,463
I am telling you,
good things are coming.

145
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:30,903
Good things.

146
00:03:31,783 --> 00:03:33,303
Thank God.

147
00:00:06,647 --> 00:00:09,287
- [speaking English] - Usually, the
Muslim Brotherhood is our biggest fear.

148
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:14,646
But everyone inside
the Square now is different.

149
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:16,887
After the government turned

150
00:00:16,888 --> 00:00:19,126
it into a life or death
situation,

151
00:00:19,127 --> 00:00:21,847
- enough, it didn't matter
- who you are and what you are doing.

152
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,267
And everyone knows that you're

153
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:26,686
here, and if you're here,
you're willing to die.

154
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:30,606
[speaking in Arabic] We are
doing this for our children.

155
00:00:30,607 --> 00:00:33,886
Even if I die,
it's for the future.

156
00:00:33,887 --> 00:00:38,846
So now that Mubarak is gone,
we have to take control.

157
00:00:38,847 --> 00:00:40,687
- [speaking in English]
- The main thing is taking the regime down.

158
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,246
Whoever is negotiating
with them...

159
00:00:42,247 --> 00:00:45,206
[man]
The regime is already down.

160
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:48,006
If you take out people
and put people just like them

161
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:49,686
from the same circle,
from the same regime,

162
00:00:49,687 --> 00:00:51,366
then you didn't take down the
regime, you took down people.

163
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:52,767
You're absolutely right.

164
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:57,766
[man speaking in Arabic]
No one is going to kill you.

165
00:00:57,767 --> 00:01:00,526
- I told you before.
- [chatter in Arabic]

166
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:05,326
The Army will sacrifice
their last drop of blood

167
00:01:05,327 --> 00:01:09,486
before they fire a single
bullet on the people.

168
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:13,246
- Never.
- [crowd applauding]

169
00:01:13,247 --> 00:01:18,167
Now, please pack
your things and go home.

170
00:01:33,007 --> 00:01:35,366
[Ahmed] When Mubarak
stepped down...

171
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:39,087
...the Armed Forces took
over the country's affairs.

172
00:01:41,127 --> 00:01:44,567
They swore to God to meet
the people's demands.

173
00:01:45,767 --> 00:01:48,127
So people went home.

174
00:01:48,887 --> 00:01:51,646
And nothing happened.

175
00:01:51,647 --> 00:01:55,046
We didn't put the killers on
trial or change the government.

176
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:56,967
There is no new constitution,

177
00:01:56,968 --> 00:01:58,886
and the Secret Police are still
in power.

178
00:01:58,887 --> 00:02:01,006
The regime is
not just Mubarak.

179
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:03,366
The regime is all
the country's institutions,

180
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:05,446
and they all have to change.

181
00:02:05,447 --> 00:02:08,647
So we went back
to the Square.

182
00:02:21,527 --> 00:02:26,286
We're entering Tahrir Square,
the place of pride and dignity,

183
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:30,526
where a tent and a blanket
can solve all your problems.

184
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:33,286
[man singing]
? We'll keep protesting! ?

185
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:35,886
[crowd singing]
? We'll keep protesting! ?

186
00:02:35,887 --> 00:02:38,046
[man] ? We're staying here,
we're not going anywhere! ?

187
00:02:38,047 --> 00:02:40,366
[crowd] ? We're staying here,
we're not going anywhere! ?

188
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:42,606
[man] ? We'll continue
our revolution! ?

189
00:02:42,607 --> 00:02:44,806
[crowd] ? We'll continue
our revolution! ?

190
00:02:44,807 --> 00:02:47,487
- [speaking English] - The main way
of communicating is through slogans.

191
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,487
- [singing in Arabic] - ? Our
revolution is a people's revolution! ?

192
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,686
[crowd] ? Our revolution
is a people's revolution! ?

193
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:53,767
- [man] ? Not a coalition's
- revolution nor a party's revolution! ?

194
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,406
[Khalid speaking English]
The expectation at first was

195
00:02:56,407 --> 00:02:59,727
- that he would go and then we'd - all
move on or find a way of doing things.

196
00:02:59,728 --> 00:03:02,166
Now, if he just goes and someone
comes in his place and we have

197
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:03,947
the whole same regime underneath

198
00:03:03,948 --> 00:03:05,726
him, then we have a major
problem.

199
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,827
It just becomes, we did all of

200
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:09,926
this in order to just to remove
him

201
00:03:09,927 --> 00:03:11,886
and put someone exactly
like him in his place.

202
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:15,366
If we still have a police state,
if we still have emergency law,

203
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:16,726
if we still have
the constitution

204
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:18,366
pretty much the
same as it is,

205
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:21,326
then if we had an election
in six months' time,

206
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:22,966
the situation would
pretty much be the same

207
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:25,726
because the tools
of the state remain the same.

208
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:27,766
[slow-tempo song]

209
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:30,566
[Khalid] We're now living
in the state of Tahrir.

210
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:32,446
It has its housing department.

211
00:03:32,447 --> 00:03:38,447
It has its borders,
it has its army.

212
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,869
the Islamist, and the old
regime led by the Army.

213
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,789
The Army has won
part of this revolution.

214
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,470
- [speaking in Arabic] - They wanted to
stop Mubarak's son from inheriting power.

215
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:18,349
Once that happened, they wanted
people to go back home,

216
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:24,109
and the country to go back
to its corrupt ways.

217
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,990
[speaking in Arabic]

218
00:00:25,991 --> 00:00:27,869
I'll tell you again,
I have a responsibility.

219
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,429
I feel it,
as an individual,

220
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,589
that I have to insist
on my point of view,

221
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,269
because there is still one
more centimetre I could gain.

222
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,229
Even if it's just one
centimetre, one inch.

223
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,750
- [Hossam speaking in Arabic] - The Army
are the leaders of the counter-revolution.

224
00:00:42,753 --> 00:00:47,029
[in English] You've already won
a lot, and it is threatened.

225
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,910
- [crowd chattering in Arabic]
- This is a warning.

226
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,029
Leave! Go home.

227
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,429
If you don't leave,
I will shoot you.

228
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,869
Egyptians do not
revolt easily.

229
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,309
For us to revolt, it means
we've had enough. Enough!

230
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,029
We'll free our country,
no matter what.

231
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,829
And we'll take
down the regime.

232
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,309
The people are determined
to continue their revolution.

233
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,909
Do whatever you want to us.

234
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,109
We're staying,
this is our Square.

235
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,589
The people are the source
of authority, not the Army.

236
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,349
[man] You are saying that
it's a peaceful protest.

237
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:25,029
You think you can
do whatever you want

238
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,109
and we won't attack you.

239
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,749
But we will attack
if necessary.

240
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,709
That's how it is.
That's the end of it.

241
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,010
- [man] You're imposing a

242
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,309
curfew?
- Yes, God willing.

243
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,570
- [man] You mean just in

244
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:37,829
the Square?
- No, everywhere.

245
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,349
[man] But, sir...

246
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,589
Mister,
I'm afraid this won't do.

247
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,510
- [man] But they told us - yesterday, we
could continue the sit-in in the Square.

248
00:01:45,513 --> 00:01:47,509
- Off you go. Leave.
- Yes, sir.

249
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,470
- Why the Square in particular?
- [crowd chattering]

250
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,869
[Ahmed] We took these
barricades from the police,

251
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:00,109
so we'd be able
to stop any attack.

252
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:05,909
We do trust the Army. But there
are some leaders in the Army

253
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,509
who are corrupt because
they are part of Mubarak's era.

254
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,829
Everyone's awake.

255
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,070
There might be an
attack at any time.

256
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,870
[low chatter in Arabic]

257
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,389
[horns honking]

258
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,470
[choatic shouting]

259
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,150
[shouting in Arabic]

260
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,829
[man] Where are the tents?

261
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,230
There are no tents,
they're clearing the Square.

262
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,829
What's going on?

263
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,190
[man] Move, move.

264
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,789
[crowd shouting]

265
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,270
- [gunfire]
- [chaotic chatter]

266
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:40,430
[overlapping chatter
in Arabic]

267
00:00:00,733 --> 00:00:03,052
They used to come
in the middle of the night.

268
00:00:03,053 --> 00:00:05,652
They used to
take you away violently.

269
00:00:05,653 --> 00:00:08,113
You were afraid to dream

270
00:00:08,114 --> 00:00:10,572
the wrong dream for fear
of punishment.

271
00:00:10,573 --> 00:00:13,972
They used to search
his computer,

272
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:16,732
looking for anything

273
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:21,452
religious or Islamic.

274
00:00:21,453 --> 00:00:24,612
They used to come,
and no one could say a word.

275
00:00:24,613 --> 00:00:27,893
[Khalid speaking English]
He was electrocuted and beaten.

276
00:00:29,893 --> 00:00:33,852
The Army's in this position,
generally, at the moment

277
00:00:33,853 --> 00:00:37,932
where no one
believes that they

278
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:40,332
could torture people
or could do anything bad

279
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:45,412
and are extremely happy with
them for taking responsibility

280
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:49,132
to return us all to stability
and all of that kind of thing.

281
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:55,492
This is not the right way
to block a facility

282
00:00:55,493 --> 00:00:58,332
that represents
the authority of the nation.

283
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:02,612
Compare it to what
happened in England.

284
00:01:02,613 --> 00:01:05,012
When David Cameron said,

285
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:08,892
I'm going to take licence
to use the ammunition

286
00:01:08,893 --> 00:01:13,892
against anyone trying to make
a kind of demonstration

287
00:01:13,893 --> 00:01:17,012
in front of Downing Street
or any facility.

288
00:01:17,013 --> 00:01:21,212
What happened?
All of them withdraw.

289
00:01:21,213 --> 00:01:24,812
Why? Because they know
the man is serious.

290
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:27,892
And this is according
to the law.

291
00:01:27,893 --> 00:01:32,613
So why do you deny it
from the Egyptian authority?

292
00:01:38,213 --> 00:01:40,252
[Khalid] The battle isn't just
the rocks and stones.

293
00:01:40,253 --> 00:01:42,492
The battle is in the images.

294
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:44,853
The battle is in the stories.

295
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:51,092
[overlapping chatter in Arabic]

296
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:52,813
- Shh!
- [chatter continues]

297
00:01:54,653 --> 00:02:01,292
[speaking in Arabic] We decided
to create a space which supports

298
00:02:01,293 --> 00:02:05,812
those fighting
for the revolution

299
00:02:05,813 --> 00:02:09,092
through video
and various types of media.

300
00:02:09,093 --> 00:02:12,092
It's what's called
"popular media,"

301
00:02:12,093 --> 00:02:14,492
using websites like YouTube.

302
00:02:14,493 --> 00:02:19,372
If you know anyone who
has a digital camera

303
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:21,892
they're not using, tell us.

304
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:24,892
We should film
as much as we can.

305
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:27,972
The truth is that things
are moving quickly.

306
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:31,133
We don't know when this footage
can be used as evidence.

307
00:02:32,893 --> 00:02:37,012
If people are being fooled about
what is really happening here,

308
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:39,652
we must film everything
and show them the truth.

309
00:02:39,653 --> 00:02:43,973
As long as there's a camera,
the revolution will continue.

310
00:02:44,853 --> 00:02:48,292
The problem now with the media

311
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,492
is that they oppose change

312
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:54,652
and turn people
against the revolution.

313
00:02:54,653 --> 00:02:57,332
[Hossam]
So, what will you do?

314
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:01,092
Well, I am going
to keep exposing them.

315
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:02,972
And they'll keep
exposing themselves.

316
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:09,492
Until the corrupt
media falls.

317
00:03:09,493 --> 00:03:12,452
What are you going to do?
Start a television station?

318
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:14,772
Yes, hopefully I will.

319
00:03:14,773 --> 00:03:16,913
Well, you'll have to put it

320
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:19,052
in Cyprus or else they will
destroy it.

321
00:03:19,053 --> 00:03:21,972
[speaking in English] So you'll
need a massive amount of money.

322
00:03:21,973 --> 00:03:26,732
[speaking in Arabic] Yours,
because your people are poor.

323
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:31,933
And who is this democracy
and freedom for?

324
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:38,853
The poor and underprivileged.

325
00:00:01,796 --> 00:00:05,995
- Give others a chance to speak.
- Please go ahead.

326
00:00:05,996 --> 00:00:10,276
- No. Carry on, Ahmed.
- [all chattering]

327
00:00:13,396 --> 00:00:16,715
God give you strength.

328
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:19,716
[overlapping chatter]

329
00:00:27,156 --> 00:00:29,676
[man singing prayer song
in Arabic]

330
00:00:51,956 --> 00:00:55,355
- I missed you.
- I missed you a lot.

331
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:57,155
- How are you?
- Good.

332
00:00:57,156 --> 00:01:00,955
There's a massive
turnout today.

333
00:01:00,956 --> 00:01:03,676
[prayer continues in Arabic]

334
00:01:05,516 --> 00:01:06,856
- But it's a different

335
00:01:06,857 --> 00:01:08,195
crowd today.
- Meaning?

336
00:01:08,196 --> 00:01:12,955
There's a big presence
of Muslim Brotherhood.

337
00:01:12,956 --> 00:01:14,635
- More than the last week?
- For sure.

338
00:01:14,636 --> 00:01:17,436
Yes, the Brotherhood
wasn't here last week.

339
00:01:19,236 --> 00:01:24,395
[Magdy] All the Muslim Brothers
were told to be here today.

340
00:01:24,396 --> 00:01:28,995
It's been said that
the Muslim Brotherhood

341
00:01:28,996 --> 00:01:31,556
made a deal
with the Army.

342
00:01:32,636 --> 00:01:34,395
This is what's
being said.

343
00:01:34,396 --> 00:01:37,035
Honestly, I'm upset about their
political tactics and games.

344
00:01:37,036 --> 00:01:39,395
They should not
be here for

345
00:01:39,396 --> 00:01:44,275
a political agenda
or gains.

346
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:49,515
Some Brotherhood leaders make
secret deals with the Army

347
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:56,715
and use their presence in the
Square as a negotiating tool.

348
00:01:56,716 --> 00:02:00,835
You know I think
this is wrong.

349
00:02:00,836 --> 00:02:03,956
[crowd chanting]

350
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,075
The Quran is
our constitution!

351
00:02:07,076 --> 00:02:10,475
[man] Islamic rule!
Islamic rule!

352
00:02:10,476 --> 00:02:12,916
[Ahmed] The Muslim Brotherhood

353
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:15,355
started yelling, "Islamic rule,
Islamic rule."

354
00:02:15,356 --> 00:02:18,875
What do they mean by Islamic?
Aren't we Muslims too?

355
00:02:18,876 --> 00:02:21,816
The Brotherhood began to use

356
00:02:21,817 --> 00:02:24,755
the Square to negotiate
with the Army.

357
00:02:24,756 --> 00:02:28,075
They're not calling
for the people's demands.

358
00:02:28,076 --> 00:02:31,555
But for their
political demands.

359
00:02:31,556 --> 00:02:34,875
The Brotherhood ruined
the sit-in.

360
00:02:34,876 --> 00:02:38,835
[man] They've created divisions
amongst everyone in the Square.

361
00:02:38,836 --> 00:02:45,156
They are exhausting
everyone with their lies.

362
00:02:46,676 --> 00:02:48,675
Thank you.

363
00:02:48,676 --> 00:02:52,475
- What are you going to eat?
- I have some.

364
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:55,115
When the Brotherhood
are active,

365
00:02:55,116 --> 00:02:59,155
people say they are
hijacking the revolution.

366
00:02:59,156 --> 00:03:00,795
But the Brotherhood existed
long before the revolution.

367
00:03:00,796 --> 00:03:04,795
But you change your statements
based on where you are.

368
00:03:04,796 --> 00:03:07,995
In Cairo, you say you
a want secular state.

369
00:03:07,996 --> 00:03:10,795
In other areas, you say
you want a religious one.

370
00:03:10,796 --> 00:03:12,936
You are the biggest supporters

371
00:03:12,937 --> 00:03:15,075
of the Military Council,
standing against us.

372
00:03:15,076 --> 00:03:16,616
You speak in the name

373
00:03:16,617 --> 00:03:18,155
of religion to get what
you want.

374
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,155
You contradict your
statements all the time.

375
00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:22,835
[chuckling]
Hold on, look at this.

376
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:25,395
[woman] I'm very sorry that
you were beaten in the past.

377
00:03:25,396 --> 00:03:29,355
No, not beaten. We've spent
our lives in prison cells.

378
00:03:29,356 --> 00:03:32,635
The Muslim Brotherhood
has damaged the image of Islam.

379
00:03:32,636 --> 00:03:34,475
I am embarrassed of being
a Muslim because of you.

380
00:03:34,476 --> 00:03:40,476
The Brotherhood has
hijacked the revolution,

381
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,219
OK, where's your film?

382
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,739
No, you did.

383
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,579
Yeah, yeah.

384
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,940
Your ID.

385
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,019
Open the camera.

386
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,819
Show me the camera.

387
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,780
- [man yelling] I want to see
- your ID. - [gunshot nearby]

388
00:00:13,783 --> 00:00:15,580
Don't step outside.

389
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,420
[speaking English] I lived in

390
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,779
the '70s in England when IRA
people or any demonstration

391
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,920
were also beaten up,

392
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:26,059
and electrified

393
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,520
and they twisted their arms

394
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:28,979
and I don't know what.

395
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,779
A special machine
to put their fingers in.

396
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,420
- So, what I'm supposed to

397
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:34,059
accept that?
- No, no, you are not.

398
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,060
- No, you are not supposed to - accept, but
you are supposed to weigh in on things.

399
00:00:38,063 --> 00:00:41,539
I am weighing in things,
I'm weighing in things.

400
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,499
You seem to take
a few things for granted.

401
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,459
[indistinct chatter]

402
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,859
Well, this is why we want to get
rid of them as soon as possible.

403
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,579
And to say that the people
are not ready to vote

404
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,419
is just very condescending
and wrong.

405
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,980
- [Khalid] I'm not against people
- voting however the way they want.

406
00:00:59,983 --> 00:01:04,619
[speaking in Arabic]
Yeah, I know you don't agree.

407
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,140
- [in English] The difference - between me
and you and many of the young people...

408
00:01:08,143 --> 00:01:10,380
- [Khalid in Arabic] You want
- parliamentary elections in two months?

409
00:01:10,383 --> 00:01:13,259
- Yes, I want people to vote.
- In two months?

410
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,819
Yes, yes. [in English]
As soon as possible.

411
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,619
- There are no decent parties.
- OK, so what?

412
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,219
Because you've been living
in a vacuum for 30 years.

413
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,979
OK, you've been living
for the 30 years.

414
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,099
Yet people are complaining that
the Muslim Brotherhood will win.

415
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,739
[speaking in Arabic]
Fuck this.

416
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,139
[in English] And they have been
living in the same vacuum.

417
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,939
Yet they do have a following.

418
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,179
You could only start making
parties a week ago.

419
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,979
Humanity has not discovered
anything better

420
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,579
for representation
than elections.

421
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,339
If we don't have this
as soon as possible...

422
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,659
Elections that happen under
circumstances in which

423
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,379
- you can have proper elections.
- No.

424
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,499
It's about there being
a voice that is there...

425
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,899
Between the ex-regime
as a major power force

426
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,739
and the Brotherhood
as a major power force.

427
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,020
- Where is anything in - the middle? Who
is...? What is there in the middle?

428
00:02:01,023 --> 00:02:04,100
- Who do they vote for? - Who do they
vote for? - [overlapping dialogue]

429
00:02:04,103 --> 00:02:06,219
Tell me at least
who they can vote for.

430
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,219
I believe that the millions
who made this happen,

431
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,259
I believe that the majority
of them were not people

432
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,740
- who wanted the old regime - and were
not people who wanted the Brotherhood.

433
00:02:14,743 --> 00:02:18,619
I am so fucking scared
of the moment

434
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,899
a lieutenant or a brigadier
general or something

435
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,979
will say,
"Enough of this rubbish.

436
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,699
We are back to military
rule completely."

437
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,859
It is in their interest that it
disintegrates into chaos.

438
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,400
It is in their interest to say,

439
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:38,940
"OK, you people.
Enough law and order."

440
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,340
[casual whistling]

441
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,780
[horn honking]

442
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,900
[speaking in Arabic]

443
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:58,619
Enough of this. All the
politicians are failures.

444
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,099
The Muslim Brothers,
the Salafis, the Socialists,

445
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,660
the Liberals,
they're all failures.

446
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,699
I've decided to walk in
the middle of the street.

447
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,659
The cars can do
whatever they want.

448
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,739
What can they do?
Run me over?

449
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,259
They need to curb
to the side, not me.

450
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,260
I will stand my ground.

451
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,019
Go away.

452
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,460
Enough walking cautiously
on the side.

453
00:00:01,643 --> 00:00:04,043
We managed to kick them

454
00:00:04,044 --> 00:00:06,442
out and the prosecutors
left with them.

455
00:00:06,443 --> 00:00:08,522
Now we're waiting for the
families to make a decision,

456
00:00:08,523 --> 00:00:10,922
whether they do the autopsies
or bury the bodies immediately.

457
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:13,922
Without the autopsy evidence,
there'll be a big problem.

458
00:00:13,923 --> 00:00:17,522
They'll be able to say,
"Oh, they died in a stampede."

459
00:00:17,523 --> 00:00:19,962
They have to do autopsies.
They have to be filmed.

460
00:00:19,963 --> 00:00:22,203
Because there are clear

461
00:00:22,204 --> 00:00:24,442
marks that they were
run over by tanks.

462
00:00:24,443 --> 00:00:27,362
They summarised all you wrote,

463
00:00:27,363 --> 00:00:30,042
and said he died from
a bullet in the chest.

464
00:00:30,043 --> 00:00:33,002
Stay here.
I'll get you the report.

465
00:00:33,003 --> 00:00:36,282
[chatter in Arabic]

466
00:00:36,283 --> 00:00:41,722
- [overlapping shouts]
- [shrill whistle]

467
00:00:41,723 --> 00:00:43,682
[Ragia] For a year,
we've been in this mess.

468
00:00:43,683 --> 00:00:46,103
In this shit, in this

469
00:00:46,104 --> 00:00:48,522
country, because of
every time we keep silent.

470
00:00:48,523 --> 00:00:51,562
We can't stay silent.
We have to keep the pressure on.

471
00:00:51,563 --> 00:00:53,602
We might not win this time,
but maybe next time.

472
00:00:53,603 --> 00:00:56,322
People must know
they will be punished

473
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,842
and be afraid of that.

474
00:00:58,843 --> 00:01:01,042
People can't take it anymore.

475
00:01:01,043 --> 00:01:03,882
They're losing their nerves.

476
00:01:03,883 --> 00:01:06,003
The Egyptian regime was

477
00:01:06,004 --> 00:01:08,122
able to fool both Muslims
and Christians.

478
00:01:08,123 --> 00:01:13,442
They want to suffocate us.

479
00:01:13,443 --> 00:01:15,042
If it remains stuck
in our minds

480
00:01:15,043 --> 00:01:18,122
that it's a sectarian problem,
that will be a crisis.

481
00:01:18,123 --> 00:01:20,322
[man]
The Army wants this to happen.

482
00:01:20,323 --> 00:01:21,722
The Army wants to divide us.

483
00:01:21,723 --> 00:01:24,162
There is an old saying:

484
00:01:24,163 --> 00:01:25,562
- "Divide and conquer."
- [man] Exactly.

485
00:01:25,563 --> 00:01:28,883
They want to divide
Muslims and Christians.

486
00:01:33,603 --> 00:01:37,842
[woman] Why, Mina? Didn't I tell
you not to go to protests?

487
00:01:37,843 --> 00:01:41,282
"I won't go.
I'll do as you say, Mom."

488
00:01:41,283 --> 00:01:46,242
But you tricked me and went,
and took your life away from me.

489
00:01:46,243 --> 00:01:49,762
"If I died a martyr, Mom,
would you be sad for me, Mom?"

490
00:01:49,763 --> 00:01:51,922
I'm not sad for
the martyr in you.

491
00:01:51,923 --> 00:01:53,842
But losing you hurts,
my love.

492
00:01:53,843 --> 00:01:58,442
I'm not sad for the martyr
in you, my love.

493
00:01:58,443 --> 00:01:59,723
I'm not sad for the martyr

494
00:01:59,724 --> 00:02:01,003
in you, my love.

495
00:02:02,483 --> 00:02:04,803
[speaking in Arabic]

496
00:02:05,523 --> 00:02:07,802
Our parting hurts, Mina.

497
00:02:07,803 --> 00:02:10,403
[no audible dialogue]

498
00:02:29,803 --> 00:02:32,443
[no audible dialogue]

499
00:02:44,563 --> 00:02:47,203
[no audible dialogue]

500
00:02:59,043 --> 00:03:00,923
[chanting in Arabic]

501
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:09,423
- Our Army is firing at us!

502
00:03:09,424 --> 00:03:11,682
- A new revolution all over
again!

503
00:03:11,683 --> 00:03:13,242
Live free or die heroes!

504
00:03:13,243 --> 00:03:16,202
- [overlapping dialogue]
- Our Army has protected you!

505
00:03:16,203 --> 00:03:18,282
And protected the revolution!

506
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:19,882
The Army didn't protect
the revolution.

507
00:03:19,883 --> 00:03:21,802
The Army protected
their interests,

508
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:23,122
but betrayed
the revolution!

509
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:24,562
- Betrayed the revolution!
- Protected!

510
00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:26,202
Betrayed the revolution!
Betrayed the revolution!

511
00:03:26,203 --> 00:03:28,763
- Betrayed the revolution!
- The Army betrayed the revolution!

512
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:31,122
So you are right
and all of us are wrong?

513
00:03:31,123 --> 00:03:34,243
- [overlapping shouts]
- Betrayed the revolution!

514
00:00:17,466 --> 00:00:20,946
[chanting] The people demand
the fall of the military regime!

515
00:00:25,106 --> 00:00:28,786
[Ahmed] They were firing
live bullets at us.

516
00:00:29,626 --> 00:00:31,786
[overlapping shouts]

517
00:00:35,346 --> 00:00:40,385
[Ahmed] Firing randomly in
every corner of the Square.

518
00:00:40,386 --> 00:00:42,826
[indistinct shouts]

519
00:00:46,586 --> 00:00:48,066
[gunshots]

520
00:00:52,946 --> 00:00:56,186
People were falling one by one.

521
00:00:57,946 --> 00:01:02,266
Just because they were saying,
"Down with military rule."

522
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:05,946
- [chaotic shouting]
- [gunfire]

523
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:11,626
[sirens wailing]

524
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,506
[Ahmed] Revolutionaries.

525
00:01:18,506 --> 00:01:25,865
The good and free people
are being called traitors...

526
00:01:25,866 --> 00:01:30,346
...while the traitors
are called heroes.

527
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:42,226
[sirens wailing]

528
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,666
[all shouting]

529
00:01:50,786 --> 00:01:54,865
It was too much.
Too many bullets.

530
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:56,866
[overlapping gunfire]

531
00:02:01,586 --> 00:02:03,826
[crowd shouting]

532
00:02:06,106 --> 00:02:09,025
Our Army is killing us.

533
00:02:09,026 --> 00:02:10,785
They can't be Egyptians!

534
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:14,106
They forgot Egypt!

535
00:02:17,026 --> 00:02:19,505
[overlapping chatter]

536
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:23,346
[man] He's alive, he's alive!

537
00:02:25,826 --> 00:02:26,986
[gasping]

538
00:02:28,826 --> 00:02:32,425
[Ahmed]
Death always knocks on my door.

539
00:02:32,426 --> 00:02:34,506
Knocking on my head.

540
00:02:43,106 --> 00:02:44,946
[low chatter in Arabic]

541
00:02:46,346 --> 00:02:48,946
[speaking English]
I'm trying to do a daily report.

542
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,906
- [woman] You going to

543
00:02:55,907 --> 00:02:57,346
get it out online?
- Yes.

544
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:01,506
- [man] I think we can

545
00:03:01,507 --> 00:03:03,866
cut into the...
- [low chatter]

546
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:21,786
[crowd chanting in Arabic
in distance]

547
00:03:24,026 --> 00:03:26,906
- [man speaking English] - The Muslim
Brotherhood has not really participated

548
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:28,625
in these protests whatsoever.

549
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:31,145
They want the elections
to go forward as planned

550
00:03:31,146 --> 00:03:33,385
because they stand
to gain the most from them,

551
00:03:33,386 --> 00:03:36,386
and they are being

552
00:03:36,387 --> 00:03:39,386
severely accused by
the revolutionary youth

553
00:00:01,049 --> 00:00:02,889
Hey, kiddo, are you OK?

554
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,208
[loud bangs]

555
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:07,689
[man] Ahmed! Ahmed!

556
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:11,169
[overlapping chatter]

557
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:17,488
[man] Let me pass, let me pass!

558
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:20,089
[chatter in Arabic]

559
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:26,688
Is it a bullet?

560
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:28,249
A bullet?

561
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:33,129
Is it a bullet?
Or a rock?

562
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:36,888
[woman]
Can I have some bandages?

563
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:38,928
[man] Bandages, bandages!

564
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:41,049
- [woman] Why is there all

565
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,169
this blood?
- [man] Why all this blood?

566
00:00:54,369 --> 00:01:00,928
[sniffling] They're gassing the
hospital and people are dying.

567
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:05,168
Even the doctors are dying.

568
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:09,728
I think it's nerve gas.
You collapse and convulse.

569
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:13,528
- Did you film any of this?
- I filmed but then I fell.

570
00:01:13,529 --> 00:01:15,048
You couldn't take it?

571
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:19,688
I was shaking and suffocating.
Everyone was.

572
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:22,608
The patients have to be moved,
or they will die.

573
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:24,249
[overlapping chatter]

574
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,528
[woman 1]
These are being thrown at us.

575
00:01:31,529 --> 00:01:34,729
This is what is making us
fall to the ground.

576
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:39,448
[woman 2] America?

577
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:41,729
[man] A gift.

578
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:48,529
[man speaking English] These

579
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,768
battles have been raging not
for hours, but for days.

580
00:01:50,769 --> 00:01:53,648
[woman] Up to 14 people have
been killed, hundreds injured.

581
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:56,808
A video uploaded yesterday on
YouTube has circulated widely,

582
00:01:56,809 --> 00:02:00,368
provoked outrage at the extent
of police brutality.

583
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:02,929
[speaking in Arabic] General

584
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,488
Tantawi denied that any live
bullets have been fired.

585
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:07,688
Glorious people of Egypt.

586
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:09,729
What we are witnessing

587
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,768
now on the streets
and television

588
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:14,669
are just accusations

589
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,568
attempting to smear the image
of the military.

590
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:22,528
The Armed Forces
will move forward

591
00:02:22,529 --> 00:02:26,528
with parliamentary
elections as planned.

592
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:29,369
Presidential elections

593
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,208
will take place before
the end of June 2012.

594
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:35,969
It's the first time
he dares speak to us!

595
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:40,069
- [overlapping shouts from

596
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,608
crowd]
- [sirens wailing in distance]

597
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:44,328
[speaking English]
Hello, can you hear me?

598
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:46,408
I have no fear about the
future of this country.

599
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:48,209
I have fear for a future of

600
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,008
this country which includes
the military,

601
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:52,568
and a military that wants
to be above the rule of law,

602
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:55,248
a military that wants
to be above the constitution,

603
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:57,488
a military that doesn't want
to tell us how much money

604
00:02:57,489 --> 00:02:59,489
they're stealing from this

605
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,488
country, a military
that is receiving aid

606
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:04,689
- in the millions - and billions
from the US and other governments.

607
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:06,769
[overlapping shouts]

608
00:03:14,649 --> 00:03:16,769
[line ringing]

609
00:03:20,929 --> 00:03:22,288
[woman speaks Arabic]
Hi, Ahmed.

610
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:24,208
[Ahmed]
How did you know it was me?

611
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:26,008
[woman] Of course, honey,
you're my sweetheart.

612
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:29,009
[Ahmed chuckles] So quickly
you said, "Hello, Ahmed."

613
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:32,529
[woman] How are you doing?

614
00:00:00,273 --> 00:00:03,832
A revolution that
removed a regime, OK?

615
00:00:03,833 --> 00:00:06,752
Before the people
destroyed it.

616
00:00:06,753 --> 00:00:08,872
[man] Did the Army protect
the revolution?

617
00:00:08,873 --> 00:00:11,053
We didn't protect

618
00:00:11,054 --> 00:00:13,232
the revolution,
we made it happen.

619
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:16,312
You kids don't
know anything.

620
00:00:16,313 --> 00:00:18,472
[chatter in Arabic on TV]

621
00:00:18,473 --> 00:00:20,912
I was beaten
with boots and sticks.

622
00:00:20,913 --> 00:00:22,912
I'm bruised from being
beaten all over my body.

623
00:00:22,913 --> 00:00:25,512
I've lived in the military
world for 40 years.

624
00:00:25,513 --> 00:00:28,133
I am honestly telling

625
00:00:28,134 --> 00:00:30,752
you the Armed Forces
are not like this. At all.

626
00:00:30,753 --> 00:00:33,273
You've been entrusted

627
00:00:33,274 --> 00:00:35,792
with a nation's security.
It's your duty.

628
00:00:35,793 --> 00:00:37,752
So all I'm asking is,

629
00:00:37,753 --> 00:00:40,913
- how can I entrust a nation
- to those who can't even protect a woman?

630
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,033
Even if I am your

631
00:00:43,034 --> 00:00:45,152
brother, at some point,
I must be tough on you.

632
00:00:45,153 --> 00:00:49,472
I don't understand why.
Why?

633
00:00:49,473 --> 00:00:51,553
When the Army first came

634
00:00:51,554 --> 00:00:53,632
to the streets,
people climbed on tanks

635
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:55,472
and hugged the soldiers
and clapped for them.

636
00:00:55,473 --> 00:01:00,152
What then? Why?
What's wrong with you?

637
00:01:00,153 --> 00:01:03,953
- I swear to you, Ghada, - one day you'll
say you met General Hamdy Bekheit,

638
00:01:03,956 --> 00:01:06,072
and he told you
the following:

639
00:01:06,073 --> 00:01:08,952
None of the guilty
will get away with it.

640
00:01:08,953 --> 00:01:11,913
Whatever happens.
I promise you.

641
00:01:13,593 --> 00:01:17,153
This is a picture of a friend
who took a bullet in his leg.

642
00:01:18,473 --> 00:01:20,272
This is not
an Army bullet.

643
00:01:20,273 --> 00:01:22,113
It doesn't look like one.

644
00:01:24,473 --> 00:01:27,592
The most beautiful thing
about our Square

645
00:01:27,593 --> 00:01:30,472
is that everyone who comes here
follows his conscience,

646
00:01:30,473 --> 00:01:33,432
not some political force.

647
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:36,592
And that's what
makes us strong.

648
00:01:36,593 --> 00:01:38,773
We're here presenting Cinema

649
00:01:38,774 --> 00:01:40,952
Tahrir to remind us why
we are here,

650
00:01:40,953 --> 00:01:44,432
and to show the people who
ask us why we're still here.

651
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:49,433
Because only we
can tell our stories.

652
00:02:08,113 --> 00:02:11,192
[Ahmed] The revolutionaries
who toppled the regime

653
00:02:11,193 --> 00:02:15,433
have died, been injured,
or gone to prison.

654
00:02:16,473 --> 00:02:18,872
And with no constitution,

655
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:22,952
they want to hold elections
stained by revolutionary blood,

656
00:02:22,953 --> 00:02:26,712
supervised by those
who killed the revolutionaries.

657
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,032
And they made two ballot boxes.

658
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:33,072
One for the killer,
and one for the traitor.

659
00:02:33,073 --> 00:02:37,712
Our voices will keep getting
higher and higher,

660
00:02:37,713 --> 00:02:40,953
because the streets
are our ballot boxes.

661
00:02:46,393 --> 00:02:48,273
[horns honking]

662
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:55,273
- [man speaking English] - The next Egyptian
president will either be an Islamist

663
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:58,633
- from the Muslim - Brotherhood
or Mubarak's last prime minister,

664
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:01,553
- and that has left
- many of the so-called revolutionaries

665
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:05,033
with a very tough choice
in a very close race.

666
00:03:08,393 --> 00:03:10,792
[speaking in Arabic]
I don't want either.

667
00:03:10,793 --> 00:03:15,672
We're stuck between
a rock and a hard place.

668
00:03:15,673 --> 00:03:18,592
We'll have to accept
whatever happens.

669
00:03:18,593 --> 00:03:20,392
[chatter on TV]

670
00:03:20,393 --> 00:03:23,792
Everyone keep
your voices down.

671
00:03:23,793 --> 00:03:27,912
[man on TV]
With 51.73 percent,

672
00:03:27,913 --> 00:03:32,432
13 million,
230 thousand and 131...

673
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:38,433
Listen up!

674
00:00:03,896 --> 00:00:06,815
we have the same problems.

675
00:00:06,816 --> 00:00:09,855
It's crazy, we made a revolution
and no new constitution.

676
00:00:09,856 --> 00:00:13,815
We got a president
without a constitution.

677
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:16,455
The most important thing
is the new constitution.

678
00:00:16,456 --> 00:00:18,135
And now it's under
their control.

679
00:00:18,136 --> 00:00:23,295
Religion is the biggest problem
we will face in this next phase,

680
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:26,855
because we have
a new political power

681
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:29,815
that also claims it's
a religious organisation,

682
00:00:29,816 --> 00:00:33,416
a missionary force,
and this is a disaster.

683
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:38,055
[Ahmed] Magdy, I love you.

684
00:00:38,056 --> 00:00:40,335
But I hate
the Brotherhood.

685
00:00:40,336 --> 00:00:44,135
They made shitty decisions,
and we're in a shitty situation.

686
00:00:44,136 --> 00:00:47,935
[Magdy] You elected a president.
You need to be patient.

687
00:00:47,936 --> 00:00:49,735
For how long?

688
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:54,055
The President is a man who
I trust with my religion.

689
00:00:54,056 --> 00:00:57,735
Can't I trust him
with my politics too?

690
00:00:57,736 --> 00:01:02,095
This is the constitution
of the Brotherhood.

691
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:05,215
We are Egyptian citizens.

692
00:01:05,216 --> 00:01:08,975
We are not
Brotherhood citizens.

693
00:01:08,976 --> 00:01:13,615
You were against torture,
and now you're torturing.

694
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:15,935
Against corruption,
and now you're corrupt.

695
00:01:15,936 --> 00:01:18,375
Who brought
Morsi into power?

696
00:01:18,376 --> 00:01:20,175
- [Ahmed] The people.
- The people.

697
00:01:20,176 --> 00:01:22,156
Because they felt

698
00:01:22,157 --> 00:01:24,135
you guys were an
oppressed people.

699
00:01:24,136 --> 00:01:27,215
This document will allow what
happened to you to happen to me.

700
00:01:27,216 --> 00:01:28,735
- Do you accept that?
- Of course not.

701
00:01:28,736 --> 00:01:31,975
OK, then take this constitution.
It doesn't serve me.

702
00:01:31,976 --> 00:01:34,216
I hated what they did

703
00:01:34,217 --> 00:01:36,455
to you. I went to the
streets because of it.

704
00:01:36,456 --> 00:01:38,815
Why did we go to the street?

705
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,855
Wasn't it to protest
against police brutality?

706
00:01:40,856 --> 00:01:45,735
The Secret Police
that tortured you?

707
00:01:45,736 --> 00:01:48,976
You are allowing the

708
00:01:48,977 --> 00:01:52,215
Secret Police to do
the same thing to me.

709
00:01:52,216 --> 00:01:56,255
And you're saying
"yes" to this.

710
00:01:56,256 --> 00:01:59,135
[crowd chanting in Arabic]

711
00:01:59,136 --> 00:02:04,976
The people demand
the fall of the regime!

712
00:02:11,056 --> 00:02:13,175
[Ahmed] This is the third stage
of our revolution.

713
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:17,135
We got rid of Mubarak,
then the military.

714
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:19,375
Now the focus is on
the Brotherhood.

715
00:02:19,376 --> 00:02:23,096
- [speaking English] It is a - bigger
challenge, because it will include more blood.

716
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,256
When you're fighting your

717
00:02:25,257 --> 00:02:27,415
own people, it's different
from fighting the regime.

718
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,876
Because, after all,

719
00:02:29,877 --> 00:02:32,335
even if the regime was
extremely violent and vicious,

720
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:34,336
and if they used all the

721
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:36,335
weapons they had, it's still
not as vicious

722
00:02:36,336 --> 00:02:38,496
as when the people fight each
other. It's very different.

723
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:43,956
[speaking in Arabic]

724
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:46,415
In the name of God, I am
directing this to the people

725
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,956
who have resorted

726
00:02:47,957 --> 00:02:49,495
to violence.

727
00:02:49,496 --> 00:02:53,295
The time has come
for the law

728
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:59,055
to judge them
and punish them.

729
00:02:59,056 --> 00:03:02,636
He's ordering his people

730
00:03:02,637 --> 00:03:06,215
to attack us. That's the
message behind his speech.

731
00:03:06,216 --> 00:03:08,496
Go to the streets and
attack the hell out of them.

732
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,256
[crowd shouting]

733
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:27,816
[horns honking]

734
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,935
[man shouting in Arabic]

735
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:33,535
[honking horn]

736
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:39,536
The Brotherhood has been
fucking with us for two years.

737
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:07,039
I didn't see you
today at all.

738
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,238
[woman] What did Morsi do wrong?
No one has given him a chance.

739
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:18,358
My butcher the other day yelled,
"Goddamn you, Morsi."

740
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,359
- I asked why. He said,
- "Because it is so hot." - [low chuckles]

741
00:00:21,362 --> 00:00:25,399
- Is this a joke? - If there were
alternatives, I wouldn't want Morsi.

742
00:00:25,402 --> 00:00:29,798
Honestly, we don't care
about Mubarak or Morsi.

743
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:33,598
We just want a decent
man to rule with justice.

744
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:35,198
I don't care if he's a Jew.

745
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:39,198
We're afraid that
if Morsi falls,

746
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:43,878
we will be taken
back to prisons.

747
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:45,979
Why all the focus on the

748
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,078
Brotherhood and how
horrible the President is?

749
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,878
The revolutionaries were your
friends. You lived with them.

750
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,278
- There is a fog in the country.
- [woman] No, Magdy.

751
00:00:56,279 --> 00:00:59,398
You abandoned one side
and chose the other.

752
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,318
I didn't abandon.

753
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:03,879
I chose the side that I

754
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,438
grew up with, that I felt
was supporting me.

755
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:12,199
Magdy has five children.
How does he provide for them?

756
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:14,758
The Muslim Brotherhood.

757
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:18,558
All the time Magdy
was playing revolutionary,

758
00:01:18,559 --> 00:01:21,918
being filmed, shot at,
jailed, what did he gain?

759
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:23,598
Where did that get him?

760
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,878
I never thought
we'd all be divided

761
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,798
into the Brotherhood
and other groups.

762
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,158
I'm sad. Nothing has
changed for my dad.

763
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,038
[Magdy] We haven't gained
from the revolution.

764
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,839
I still can't
get health care.

765
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,719
- It's OK.
- [all chuckling]

766
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,679
It's OK.

767
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:58,679
These are the gains
of the revolution.

768
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,078
She's filled
with tears.

769
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,678
It's OK.
Everything will be all right.

770
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:05,158
[man speaking English]
Protests continue in Egypt as

771
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,078
the country's top
opposition leaders

772
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,798
renew calls to topple
the Islamist regime.

773
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:11,838
[woman] The climax
will be an open-ended

774
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:14,398
strike across Egypt
on the 30th of June.

775
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:16,839
A grassroots campaign

776
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,278
has gathered over
18 million signatures.

777
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:21,558
They hope to install
a transitional government

778
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:23,678
and call early
presidential elections.

779
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:25,838
Muslim Brotherhood officials,
for their part,

780
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:27,679
have said that many of

781
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,518
those coming out on
June 30th are thugs.

782
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:32,438
[man speaking Arabic]
Our beloved President,

783
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:37,718
may God make June 30th
a day of pride for Islam

784
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:41,559
- and a day of doom - for the hypocrite
opposition. - [crowd cheering]

785
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:44,358
May you destroy them all.

786
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:46,918
- Defeat them and make us win.
- [crowd shouting] Amen.

787
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,838
- Protect us from their evils.
- [crowd] Amen.

788
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:53,718
President Morsi
is a line you don't cross.

789
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:56,398
- [man] Meaning?
- Meaning, if you threaten him,

790
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:59,878
- we'll spill your blood.
- Meaning?

791
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,758
Meaning, he's the legitimate
elected President.

792
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,918
But they're going to the
streets to take him down.

793
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,718
They can go to hell.

794
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,039
- Why? It's their right.
- No, It's not their right.

795
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:12,758
[crowd chanting] Freedom!

796
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,119
Freedom!

797
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,118
[Ahmed] What is revolution?

798
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:28,318
Revolution is not simply
replacing a regime.

799
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,198
Revolution is a
culture of a people.

800
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:34,558
You give them
ownership of their freedom.

801
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:37,559
That's what we gained.

802
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,559
We were able to introduce
the culture of protesting.

803
00:00:02,183 --> 00:00:04,062
[woman] You don't want to see
your friends, Khalid and Ahmed?

804
00:00:04,063 --> 00:00:07,102
[Magdy] I want to see them,
but I'm assigned here now.

805
00:00:07,103 --> 00:00:09,622
They told me I need to stay.

806
00:00:09,623 --> 00:00:12,942
I don't want to stand with
one side against the other,

807
00:00:12,943 --> 00:00:15,382
and it could result in death.
Understand?

808
00:00:15,383 --> 00:00:17,702
- [woman] Aren't you sad?
- Of course.

809
00:00:17,703 --> 00:00:22,462
That your friends
are on the opposite side?

810
00:00:22,463 --> 00:00:25,942
Who am I attacking? Am I going
to attack Khalid Abdalla?

811
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:29,662
Or Pierre who used
to host me in his apartment?

812
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:34,342
The President's speech
was not satisfactory

813
00:00:34,343 --> 00:00:37,542
to the people's demands.

814
00:00:37,543 --> 00:00:40,822
Early presidential elections
will be held.

815
00:00:40,823 --> 00:00:44,323
The head of the constitutional

816
00:00:44,324 --> 00:00:47,822
court will be the
interim President

817
00:00:47,823 --> 00:00:50,982
until a new President
is elected.

818
00:00:50,983 --> 00:00:52,643
- [crowd cheering]

819
00:00:52,644 --> 00:00:54,302
- Long live Egypt!
Long live Egypt!

820
00:00:54,303 --> 00:00:55,462
Long live Egypt!

821
00:00:55,463 --> 00:00:57,582
[inaudible dialogue]

822
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:01,502
Morsi has fallen.
So did the Army and Mubarak.

823
00:01:01,503 --> 00:01:04,342
We're waiting
for the next one.

824
00:01:04,343 --> 00:01:08,622
This is our life now,
we'll stay in the street.

825
00:01:08,623 --> 00:01:10,182
I want to go home
and sleep.

826
00:01:10,183 --> 00:01:13,303
- [cheering]
- [chattering in Arabic]

827
00:01:30,943 --> 00:01:35,502
[Ahmed] So tell me, Magdy,
what are we going to do now?

828
00:01:35,503 --> 00:01:38,123
[Magdy] Listen, Ahmed, I swear

829
00:01:38,124 --> 00:01:40,743
to God, I'm at the Brotherhood
sit-in.

830
00:01:42,743 --> 00:01:46,502
We may or may not be massacred.
It doesn't matter.

831
00:01:46,503 --> 00:01:48,203
If you're meant to die,

832
00:01:48,204 --> 00:01:49,902
it's going to happen
wherever you are.

833
00:01:49,903 --> 00:01:54,623
The more they kill, the
more we believe in our cause.

834
00:01:57,183 --> 00:02:00,743
[man] The pro-Morsi sit-in

835
00:02:00,744 --> 00:02:04,302
declared that there have been
deaths

836
00:02:04,303 --> 00:02:12,142
after they were shot at
with live bullets.

837
00:02:12,143 --> 00:02:18,302
[man 2]
A massacre by all means.

838
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:24,222
Magdy, as much as I've
been violent in words,

839
00:02:24,223 --> 00:02:26,222
that was just
anger speaking.

840
00:02:26,223 --> 00:02:30,022
[Magdy] Well, you're putting
our religion on the line.

841
00:02:30,023 --> 00:02:32,662
You're challenging our belief
of an Islamic country.

842
00:02:32,663 --> 00:02:36,702
Honestly, I want
to come be with you.

843
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:41,942
After all, this revolution was
for a principle, not for blood.

844
00:02:41,943 --> 00:02:46,222
[Ahmed] What I feared has
started happening.

845
00:02:46,223 --> 00:02:48,622
That we're going
to fight each other.

846
00:02:48,623 --> 00:02:50,543
- [man yelling] - We're all your
soldiers. Morsi! - [crowd chanting]

847
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:52,222
We'll rally beside you.
Morsi!

848
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:54,262
We'll rally beside you. Morsi!

849
00:02:54,263 --> 00:02:56,222
[chanting continues]

850
00:02:56,223 --> 00:03:00,062
[Ahmed] I don't want you
to get hurt or killed.

851
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:04,702
Magdy, when I gave you a hard
time, it was because I was mad.

852
00:03:04,703 --> 00:03:07,662
[Magdy] But we still respect
each other's opinions.

853
00:03:07,663 --> 00:03:10,222
And you and I agree.

854
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,422
We want the best
for our country.

855
00:03:12,423 --> 00:03:14,542
[Magdy]
You shouldn't come here.

856
00:03:14,543 --> 00:03:16,863
- You shouldn't come here.

857
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,182
- [Ahmed]
No, forget it, I'm coming.

858
00:03:19,183 --> 00:03:23,102
What will they do? Kill me?
That's up to God's will.

859
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:27,622
And if I die I'll just
blame it on you, Magdy.

860
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:32,102
[Magdy] You know me.
I'm not here to die or to kill.

861
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:34,342
You know my intentions.

862
00:03:34,343 --> 00:03:40,343
I swear, I know that, Magdy.

863
00:00:32,806 --> 00:00:34,405
[all singing in Arabic]

864
00:00:34,406 --> 00:00:37,085
? Freedom is coming,
that's for sure ?

865
00:00:37,086 --> 00:00:42,245
? "Liberty" was written
in our destiny ?

866
00:00:42,246 --> 00:00:45,006
[singing continues]

867
00:00:52,406 --> 00:00:54,645
? They said, riots are
in our blood ?

868
00:00:54,646 --> 00:00:57,206
? And how dare we claim
our rights? ?

869
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:18,646
[all singing] ? Freedom ?

870
00:01:20,366 --> 00:01:22,605
[shouts] ? Revolution! ?

871
00:01:22,606 --> 00:01:24,806
[crowd cheering]

872
00:01:25,646 --> 00:01:27,206
[chatter in Arabic]

873
00:01:29,246 --> 00:01:31,766
[slow song playing]

874
00:01:38,046 --> 00:01:41,925
[man] ? Oh, the Square ?

875
00:01:41,926 --> 00:01:45,925
? Where were you long ago? ?

876
00:01:45,926 --> 00:01:50,285
? With you we sung
and with you we suffered ?

877
00:01:50,286 --> 00:01:55,205
? We've prayed and
we've been scared ?

878
00:01:55,206 --> 00:01:58,965
? United day and night ?

879
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:03,445
? Nothing is
impossible with you ?

880
00:02:03,446 --> 00:02:07,765
? The sound of freedom
is gathering us ?

881
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:12,165
? And our lives
finally have meaning ?

882
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,285
? No turning back ?

883
00:02:14,286 --> 00:02:16,605
? Our voices are
finally heard ?

884
00:02:16,606 --> 00:02:20,806
? And the dream
is no longer forbidden ?

885
00:02:21,686 --> 00:02:25,645
[woman] ? Oh, the Square ?

886
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:29,805
? Where were you long ago? ?

887
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:34,005
? You've destroyed the walls
and let in the light ?

888
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:38,605
? You gathered the
broken people around you ?

889
00:02:38,606 --> 00:02:43,005
? We've been reborn ?

890
00:02:43,006 --> 00:02:46,925
? And our determined
dream was born ?

891
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:51,365
? We have our differences
but our intentions are pure ?

892
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:55,645
? Even when the picture
wasn't clear ?

893
00:02:55,646 --> 00:03:00,085
? Honouring our country
and our grandchildren ?

894
00:03:00,086 --> 00:03:05,285
? And the rights that have
been stolen from our youth ?

895
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:08,885
[together]
? Oh, the Square ?

896
00:03:08,886 --> 00:03:12,925
? Where were you long ago? ?

897
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:17,245
[man] ? With you we felt
something for the first time ?

898
00:03:17,246 --> 00:03:21,445
? But since then
we grew apart ?

899
00:03:21,446 --> 00:03:25,925
? We have to change ourselves
with our own hands ?

900
00:03:25,926 --> 00:03:30,405
? You gave us so much
and now it's our turn ?

901
00:03:30,406 --> 00:03:36,406
[woman] ? Sometimes I fear
that you become a memory ?
