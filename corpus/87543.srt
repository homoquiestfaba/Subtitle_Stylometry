I always got
what I wished for back then.

wasn't much...

00:00:57,008 --> 00:00:59,499

A lot can happen in a year,

10
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,583
which leaves me here
in New York,

00:01:37,693 --> 00:01:41,960
helping my college roommate
run a webcam pornography site:

00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:04,080
She might live
halfway across the country

19
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,254
or just across the street.

20

There she is.

is that you can see her there.

You know how to find her,

36

but you don't really know
where she is.

37
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:40,247
She's just out there somewhere.

38
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,119

all you know.

and watch her wake up
in the morning.

43
00:04:57,111 --> 00:04:58,578
You piece together
some things,

44
00:04:58,645 --> 00:05:00,306

the rest.

really want to meet her?

00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:40,225
Yes, that's right, Edward.

184
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,056
Now, I do believe

185
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:48,262
that I was training you
to be my cabin boy.

186
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,496
Hmm?

187
00:12:49,572 --> 00:12:51,437
Excuse me, Herr Captain,

188
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:55,535
but didn't you tell me
this was a German vessel?

189

[German accent]
Silence, schweinehund.

190
00:12:57,515 --> 00:13:00,279
Now, I think
that last week

191
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:02,013
I taught you
how to shine

192
00:13:02,088 --> 00:13:07,891
und polish mein boots
mit your miserable tongue.

193
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:10,054
Ahh.

194
00:13:10,131 --> 00:13:14,796
But tonight, I think
that you must learn

195
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,668
how to polish my knob.

196
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:18,605
Oh.

197
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:19,607
Oh, yes, sir.

198
00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:22,702
Yes, yes.

199
00:13:22,813 --> 00:13:28,309
And this is a very,
very fragile tool,

200
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:34,190
so you must polish it
mit the utmost care.

201

her apartment, dies,

369
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:21,874
and gets eaten
by her cats.

370
00:21:21,984 --> 00:21:22,916
What are you
talking about?

371
00:21:22,985 --> 00:21:24,111
I go out all the time.

372
00:21:24,186 --> 00:21:25,278
Yeah, when I drag you.

373
00:21:25,388 --> 00:21:26,946
It's not like I don't
have other friends.

374
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:28,114
Online.

375
00:21:28,926 --> 00:21:29,756
Look,

376
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,192
while I appreciate
your concern,

377
00:21:32,263 --> 00:21:34,197
I'd probably take you
a little more seriously

378
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:36,494
if you weren't sitting there
with your gonads hanging out.

379
00:21:37,637 --> 00:21:38,695
I got a date.

380
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:40,568
Yeah?

381
00:21:40,641 --> 00:21:41,699
With who?

382
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:45,176
That artsy
barking girl?

383
00:21:45,246 --> 00:21:46,838
Absolutely.

384
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:49,178
I thought I'd get me
a little bit more of that strange.

385
00:21:49,251 --> 00:21:49,808
Whoo!

386
00:21:49,885 --> 00:21:50,977
You want some?

387
00:21:51,053 --> 00:21:52,645
Mmm-mmm.

[Moe laughs]

392
00:21:58,663 --> 00:22:00,064
Quick observation:

393
00:22:00,065 --> 00:22:02,158
The thing that sucks
about being single

394
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:04,667
is that everyone wants
to give you advice.

395
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:06,637
Everyone wants
to set you up with somebody.

396
00:22:07,675 --> 00:22:09,370
I used to be
the relationship guy.

397
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:12,146
Things change.

398
00:22:15,384 --> 00:22:17,648
I guess life's a little
tenuous that way.

399
00:22:45,756 --> 00:22:47,087
(Moe)
Hey.

400
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,125
You want to see what me
and John do for a living?

00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:54,959
[Moira laughs]

402
00:22:55,034 --> 00:22:57,332

404
00:22:58,538 --> 00:23:00,165
You guys make porno?

405
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,538
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

406
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,237
We mostly link
people together.

407

[Beeping]

408
00:23:05,147 --> 00:23:06,842
It's kind of like
what you do.

409
00:23:06,915 --> 00:23:07,882
Kind of.

410
00:23:09,018 --> 00:23:10,815
People get off
on this shit.

411
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,755
We can watch them.

412
00:23:15,893 --> 00:23:17,520
They can watch us.

413
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,862
(Moira)
Us?

414
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:25,103
Oh, my God, no, no.

415
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:27,572
[Laughs]
Come on.

416
00:23:27,642 --> 00:23:28,574
No.

[Laughs]
Come on.

418
00:23:29,477 --> 00:23:31,945
No, Moe, please;
I don't want to.

419
00:23:32,014 --> 00:23:32,878
No, look, look, look.

420
00:23:32,948 --> 00:23:34,142
Nobody will know
who we are.

421
00:23:34,216 --> 00:23:34,944
All right?

422
00:23:35,017 --> 00:23:37,577
Look, nobody can
see your face.

423
00:23:37,654 --> 00:23:42,092
Now, you said you were
up for anything, so...

424
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,889
No, Moe, please.

425
00:23:43,962 --> 00:23:45,554
I don't...
I don't want to.

426
00:23:45,631 --> 00:23:46,928
Mmm.

427
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:48,434
Aw.

428
00:23:48,434 --> 00:23:50,336
You know I like you.

429
00:23:50,336 --> 00:23:52,201
Do it for me.

430
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:55,701
Do you love me?

431
00:23:58,213 --> 00:24:00,306
Of course I do.

432
00:24:00,383 --> 00:24:01,816
Now come on;
it'll be fun.

433
00:24:01,884 --> 00:24:03,215
Say it.

434
00:24:06,891 --> 00:24:07,915
I love you.

Oh, baby, yeah.

00:25:15,745 --> 00:25:18,179
Oh, yeah, put it
in your mouth.

00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:20,810
Oh, suck it.

439
00:25:20,884 --> 00:25:22,112
Suck it.

440
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:26,946
Yeah, just like that.

No, wait...
Ahh!

444
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:30,493

Sorry.

Uh...

00:25:34,434 --> 00:25:35,298
Is that my sock?

Oh, God, no...

00:25:37,438 --> 00:25:38,803
No, whatever.

Hi, there.

00:28:18,941 --> 00:28:21,102
I'm Jordan.

the Intercon-X site.

Oh, right.

Um,

Listen, John,

472
00:28:36,697 --> 00:28:40,064
it's kind of late,
so whatever this is about...

473
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,569
No, I thought you
were available.

474
00:28:42,671 --> 00:28:45,606
Yeah, well, I thought
you were a client.

Oh, no, no;
that's okay.

No, I like...

480
00:28:57,823 --> 00:29:00,018
or, I mean,
you look fine.

481
00:29:00,093 --> 00:29:01,219
Or the wig's
fine too.

You know, whatever;
whichever you want.

Okay.

487
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:15,072
You seem pretty nervous

488

for somebody who watches
this stuff all day.

489
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,908
I don't really
watch all day.

I guess you must know
what I do.

I could just...

what I want to do with you yet.

00:30:13,753 --> 00:30:16,278
I could suggest a few things.

Do you want anything?

516
00:30:22,297 --> 00:30:26,291
I was about to have
a glass of wine, actually.

517
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:26,834
Okay, good.

518
00:30:26,903 --> 00:30:28,461
Why don't you get yourself
a glass of wine?

00:30:28,538 --> 00:30:29,766
I'll meet you back here
in a few minutes.

So...

527
00:31:36,257 --> 00:31:37,815
Can I ask you
a personal question?

528
00:31:40,295 --> 00:31:43,093
Not real personal,
but what?

529
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:46,294

right?

531
00:31:48,372 --> 00:31:50,340
Yeah.

532
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,638
That's more or less
what I do for a living.

533
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,574
But do you ever,

534
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:58,378
you know,

535

I mean, for real?

537
00:32:03,224 --> 00:32:05,249
Sometimes.

539
00:32:08,464 --> 00:32:11,297
So tell me how it happened
the first time.

Somewhere around there.

547
00:32:27,755 --> 00:32:34,389
We had this cute
substitute teacher, Mr. Parsons,

548
00:32:34,464 --> 00:32:38,868
and I was sitting
next to him

on the bus
on a class field trip.

550
00:32:43,608 --> 00:32:46,338
And it was really bumpy

551
00:32:48,681 --> 00:32:53,312
and I started getting
that feeling again, you know?

552
00:32:53,387 --> 00:32:55,252

in my cunt.

556
00:33:06,971 --> 00:33:08,939
Are you wet?

557
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,473
Oh, yeah.

558
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:13,305
Say it.

559
00:33:14,881 --> 00:33:15,848
I'm wet.

560
00:33:17,684 --> 00:33:18,708
Show me.

561
00:33:21,789 --> 00:33:23,484
Yes, daddy.

562
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:29,287
[John breathing heavily]

563
00:33:49,324 --> 00:33:51,087
Go on.

564
00:33:52,328 --> 00:33:54,387
What happened
after that first time?

565
00:33:55,866 --> 00:33:57,299
You were on the bus.

566
00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:02,133
And l...

567
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:05,074
I didn't know
what to do.

568
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:07,874
I wanted to get up,
I wanted to run,

569
00:34:10,084 --> 00:34:11,949
but I was afraid
he'd find out.

570
00:34:12,053 --> 00:34:14,715
So I started

571
00:34:14,823 --> 00:34:19,625
crossing and uncrossing
my thighs really tight

572
00:34:19,696 --> 00:34:21,095
to try to make it stop,

573
00:34:21,164 --> 00:34:22,222
but...

574
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,394
[sighs]

575
00:34:26,471 --> 00:34:28,496
That only made it worse.

576
00:34:28,607 --> 00:34:31,132
Mmm.

577
00:34:31,243 --> 00:34:33,234
Are you getting close?

578
00:34:33,313 --> 00:34:36,146
Oh, yeah.

579
00:34:36,216 --> 00:34:39,049
It feels so good.

580
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,417
Are you going to come?

581
00:34:40,488 --> 00:34:41,614
Mmm.

582
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,657
Yeah.

583
00:34:42,725 --> 00:34:43,248
Yeah?

584
00:34:43,325 --> 00:34:44,883
Really?

585
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:45,893
Yeah.

586
00:34:45,962 --> 00:34:47,361
Yeah?

587
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:48,362
Oh, yeah.

588
00:34:48,432 --> 00:34:49,364
Yeah?

589
00:34:49,433 --> 00:34:50,900
Uh-huh.

590
00:34:50,968 --> 00:34:52,526
Then stop.

591
00:34:52,604 --> 00:34:53,832
Huh?

592
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:54,599
Right now.

593
00:34:54,706 --> 00:34:55,764
Put your hands
around the wine glass.

594
00:34:55,841 --> 00:34:56,330
Both hands.

595
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:56,807
Do it.

596
00:34:56,876 --> 00:34:57,968
But...

597
00:34:58,044 --> 00:34:58,942
Do what I tell you.

598
00:34:59,045 --> 00:35:00,137
You can get off
on your own time.

599
00:35:03,283 --> 00:35:05,148
You're a little weird,
you know that?

600
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:05,982
Shh.

601
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:11,157
I like knowing
that you have to come.

602
00:35:11,227 --> 00:35:13,127
Mmm.

603
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:13,685
[Laughs]

604
00:35:13,764 --> 00:35:15,288
I like that look
on your face.

605
00:35:15,366 --> 00:35:16,355
Asshole.

606
00:35:18,102 --> 00:35:20,468
[Breathing heavily]

607
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:21,972
You're doing it now,
aren't you?

608
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:24,168
[Breathing heavily]

609
00:35:24,244 --> 00:35:25,905
Yes.

610
00:35:25,979 --> 00:35:27,344
You're rubbing
your legs together,

611
00:35:27,415 --> 00:35:28,905
but it's just
not enough, is it?

612
00:35:29,684 --> 00:35:30,981
No.

613
00:35:31,086 --> 00:35:32,451
It's never enough,
is it?

614
00:35:36,826 --> 00:35:38,259
No.

615
00:35:38,362 --> 00:35:39,021
No.

616
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:40,996
Poor Jordan.

617
00:35:41,999 --> 00:35:43,762
I watch you.

618
00:35:43,835 --> 00:35:45,894
I see when the clients
sign off,

619
00:35:45,971 --> 00:35:46,960
you don't even notice,

620
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:49,098
because you have
to come so badly.

621
00:35:49,175 --> 00:35:51,006
You need it so much.

622
00:35:51,078 --> 00:35:52,568
Oh.

623
00:35:52,646 --> 00:35:55,308
You're the best lover
you've ever had.

624
00:35:56,317 --> 00:35:58,444
Nobody else can
make you come like you.

625
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,885
No.

626
00:35:59,955 --> 00:36:02,515
Nobody else but me,

627
00:36:02,592 --> 00:36:03,559
right now.

628
00:36:04,894 --> 00:36:06,293
I can let you
squirm all night,

629
00:36:06,363 --> 00:36:08,354
or I can make you
come so hard.

630
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:11,026
[Breathlessly]
Oh, John.

631
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:12,092
You want to
use your hands?

632
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:12,671
John.

633
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:13,330
Your fingers?

634
00:36:13,406 --> 00:36:14,771
Yes, please.

635
00:36:14,874 --> 00:36:16,171
Yeah?

636
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:17,640
Oh, my god;
you're so beautiful.

637
00:36:17,745 --> 00:36:18,939
I want to touch you
so much.

638
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:21,037
Oh, John.

639
00:36:21,149 --> 00:36:22,343
Oh, I'm coming.

640
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,439
Fuck it;
go for it.

641
00:36:24,386 --> 00:36:24,943
[Glass shattering]

642
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:30,483
Oh, John.

643
00:36:45,613 --> 00:36:48,047
[Both gasping]

644
00:36:54,991 --> 00:36:56,515
So when do we meet?

645
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:03,159
She's going to
fuck you in half.

646
00:37:03,269 --> 00:37:03,735
Okay, okay.

647
00:37:03,803 --> 00:37:04,792
She's going to
fuck you to pieces.

648
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:05,962
Okay, shh.

649
00:37:06,038 --> 00:37:07,027
[Laughing]
Oh, son.

650
00:37:07,107 --> 00:37:08,165
I don't know.

651
00:37:08,241 --> 00:37:09,401
You don't know what?

652
00:37:09,476 --> 00:37:10,807
Meeting her.

653
00:37:10,878 --> 00:37:13,176
It just seemed like a good idea
at the time, but now...

654
00:37:13,247 --> 00:37:13,975
What?

655
00:37:14,048 --> 00:37:15,413
Just, I don't know what got
into me that night,

656
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:16,644
but now this girl's
going to be expecting

657
00:37:16,718 --> 00:37:19,687
some weird Mack Daddy, 9 1 /2 Weeks,
sex machine guy and...

658
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:20,380
No, I can't.

659
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:21,252
I can smell the disaster
from here.

660
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:24,293
John, John, John; you have
got to meet this girl,

661
00:37:24,395 --> 00:37:26,329
or I will never, ever
stop giving you shit.

662
00:37:26,431 --> 00:37:27,363
No.

663
00:37:27,465 --> 00:37:27,931
(Moe)
One date.

664
00:37:28,033 --> 00:37:31,264
You, me, Moira,
Internet Chick, Halcyon.

665
00:37:31,337 --> 00:37:31,860
No.

666
00:37:31,971 --> 00:37:32,335
It'll be fun.

667
00:37:32,405 --> 00:37:33,303
Seriously.

668
00:37:33,372 --> 00:37:34,669
Dude, you're acting
really, you know,

669
00:37:34,741 --> 00:37:36,732
weird and dorky
about this.

670
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:37,708
[Laughs]

671
00:37:37,779 --> 00:37:39,371
Look, I know you were
in love with what's-her-name.

672
00:37:39,447 --> 00:37:40,072
Right?

673
00:37:40,148 --> 00:37:40,773
You still are.

674
00:37:40,849 --> 00:37:41,213
Whatever.

675
00:37:41,283 --> 00:37:44,446
But you can't stay faithful
to a chick who left you, right?

676
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,919
And I know you don't
want to think about this,

677
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:48,719
but she's probably
with some other guy right now.

678
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:49,850
No, she's not.

679
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:50,484
Dude.

680
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:51,550
No, I mean
she really isn't.

681
00:37:51,629 --> 00:37:52,960
I know she isn't.

682
00:37:54,299 --> 00:37:55,231
Whatever, man.

683
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,699
We're talking
one fucking date

684
00:37:56,769 --> 00:37:58,896
with a gorgeous fucking chick
who's already hot for you.

685
00:37:58,972 --> 00:38:01,406
I mean, why are we
talking about this?

686
00:38:01,475 --> 00:38:02,134
Huh?

687
00:38:02,209 --> 00:38:04,143
You realize there
are guys in Silicon Valley...

688
00:38:04,211 --> 00:38:06,236
geeks much richer
than you...

689
00:38:06,348 --> 00:38:08,407
who never even
talk to a real woman?

690
00:38:08,517 --> 00:38:09,245
Huh?

691
00:38:09,352 --> 00:38:11,047
Do it for them.

692
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,145
Okay, okay, okay;
all right, yes.

693
00:38:13,223 --> 00:38:13,985
Good, yes.

694
00:38:14,057 --> 00:38:14,921
I don't know
what I was thinking.

695
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:16,715
Seriously.

696
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,194
Yes, a date with a sexy
internet sex girl.

697
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:20,094
This is
a good thing.

698
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:21,154
Yeah, dude.

699
00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:22,666
I'm starting
to worry about you.

700
00:38:22,735 --> 00:38:23,599
Yeah, I know;
I know.

701
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,331
All that sitting
around the computer.

702
00:38:25,405 --> 00:38:27,202
Yes, I have to
get out more; yes.

703
00:38:27,274 --> 00:38:29,105
Two for Tron, please.

704
00:38:29,176 --> 00:38:30,541
Hey, how are you?

705
00:38:30,611 --> 00:38:32,511
$20, please.

706
00:38:32,581 --> 00:38:34,173
My friend's getting
fucked tonight.

707
00:38:34,249 --> 00:38:36,080
[Moe and man laugh]

708
00:38:36,152 --> 00:38:38,017
(John)
I mean, don't get me wrong.

709
00:38:38,121 --> 00:38:40,715
Moe is my friend,
but that same fucking rap...

710
00:38:40,824 --> 00:38:42,883
it just... it's like
a broken record.

711
00:38:42,994 --> 00:38:44,791
And even if it's
all true, you know, fuck.

712
00:38:44,863 --> 00:38:46,057
I don't nag him

713
00:38:46,131 --> 00:38:49,498
about his many, many
bad habits and shortcomings.

714
00:38:50,637 --> 00:38:52,161
At least I know
what mine are.

715
00:38:54,141 --> 00:38:55,506
And the truth is,
you know,

716
00:38:55,576 --> 00:38:57,635
for all the notches
in his belt,

717
00:38:57,712 --> 00:39:00,408
Moe has never been anywhere
near a real relationship.

718
00:39:00,482 --> 00:39:06,149
He doesn't know anything about that intense,
miraculous bond

719
00:39:06,223 --> 00:39:09,192
that comes along once
or twice in a lifetime,

720
00:39:09,293 --> 00:39:10,590
if that...
if you're lucky.

721
00:39:11,863 --> 00:39:13,490
[Sighs]

722
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:14,156
But who knows?

723
00:39:14,267 --> 00:39:16,701
You know, maybe this new girlfriend will
change all that.

724
00:39:16,803 --> 00:39:19,863
She's very attractive...

725
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,265
though I have a feeling

726
00:39:22,344 --> 00:39:25,177
she keeps her shrink's
number on speed-dial.

727
00:39:25,815 --> 00:39:26,782
[Computer chimes]

728
00:39:30,053 --> 00:39:31,577
Hey, Ed.

729
00:39:31,655 --> 00:39:33,145
Hey, girl.

730
00:39:33,224 --> 00:39:34,748
You haven't been
hanging around Final Exit,

731
00:39:34,826 --> 00:39:38,353
so I figured you were either dead
or getting some.

732
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,227
Which is it?

733
00:39:40,299 --> 00:39:41,994
Oh, Ed.

734
00:39:42,068 --> 00:39:43,228
What?

735
00:39:44,538 --> 00:39:46,062
I think I'm in love.

736
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:48,338
Uh-oh.

737
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:50,071
Here it comes.

738
00:39:50,145 --> 00:39:52,909
It's this guy, Moe.

739
00:39:52,982 --> 00:39:55,678
That's his name: Moe.

740
00:39:55,752 --> 00:39:59,017
And he's sweet
and cares about me,

741
00:39:59,123 --> 00:40:01,318
and he has a real job...

742
00:40:01,426 --> 00:40:02,757
sort of...

743
00:40:02,827 --> 00:40:04,192
[laughs]

744
00:40:04,263 --> 00:40:06,663
And I mean,
you're right, you know?

745
00:40:06,732 --> 00:40:09,200
I'm a good person,

746
00:40:09,269 --> 00:40:11,203
and I deserve
somebody good.

747
00:40:11,272 --> 00:40:12,762
[Crying]

748
00:40:16,145 --> 00:40:17,077
Ed?

749
00:40:17,146 --> 00:40:19,239
What's wrong?

750
00:40:19,315 --> 00:40:20,407
Nothing;
it's stupid.

751
00:40:20,483 --> 00:40:21,814
I don't even know
why I'm upset.

752
00:40:21,885 --> 00:40:22,681
Why?

753
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,015
What happened?

754
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,389
Oh, God.

755
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:31,395
Well, my school
had this big party

756
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:35,331
with the worst fucking
music in the world.

757
00:40:35,402 --> 00:40:37,302
And all these jarheads
and debutantes

758
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:41,570
were in their Gap khakis
and baseball caps,

759
00:40:41,643 --> 00:40:44,806
laughing, kissing,
dancing badly.

760
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,075
And I'm thinking
to myself, "Jesus Christ,

761
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,742
"there are
so many of you.

762
00:40:48,819 --> 00:40:52,186
"And all I want is
just one person for me.

763
00:40:52,256 --> 00:40:53,223
But no."

764
00:40:55,461 --> 00:40:56,621
Eventually,
it's too much,

765
00:40:56,695 --> 00:40:58,026
so I leave campus,

766
00:40:58,098 --> 00:41:02,763
and I spend three hours
hitchhiking to the big city...

767
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,735
Akron...

768
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,433
'cause some guy online told me
there was a gay club there.

769
00:41:09,412 --> 00:41:10,344
And?

770
00:41:12,648 --> 00:41:14,878
Have you ever been
to a gay bar in Akron?

771
00:41:14,985 --> 00:41:16,919
Uh, no.

772
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:20,286
The worst fucking music
in the world,

773
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:24,352
same little cliques,
same asinine conversations.

774
00:41:24,464 --> 00:41:26,398
By the end of the night,
I was so depressed,

775
00:41:26,466 --> 00:41:27,899
I wanted to slit
my fucking wrists.

776
00:41:27,968 --> 00:41:30,334
Oh, no, no, no, ;
sweetheart.

777
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,804
Look, you're going
to find somebody.

778
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:34,467
How?

779
00:41:34,543 --> 00:41:35,635
Okay,
what about online?

780
00:41:35,711 --> 00:41:37,702
Who told you
about the club in Akron?

781
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,907
This guy in New York.

782
00:41:39,984 --> 00:41:41,349
Well, what about him?

783
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:42,248
Hello?

784
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,048
I just said
he lives in New York.

785
00:41:44,122 --> 00:41:46,283
So?

786
00:41:46,391 --> 00:41:47,756
Do you like him?

787
00:41:47,827 --> 00:41:49,488
Yeah, but...

788
00:41:49,562 --> 00:41:51,291
Does he like you?

789
00:41:51,365 --> 00:41:54,459
[Laughs]
I don't...

790
00:41:54,535 --> 00:41:55,559
What?

791
00:42:00,009 --> 00:42:01,567
I am so pathetic.

792
00:42:03,513 --> 00:42:04,844
It's amusing, really.

793
00:42:04,915 --> 00:42:05,882
Why?

794
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,585
Forget it.

795
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:13,522
Listen, just...

796
00:42:13,592 --> 00:42:15,560
thanks for listening
to my bullshit.

797
00:42:16,496 --> 00:42:17,963
Ed, are you okay?

798
00:42:19,867 --> 00:42:20,196
Yeah.

799
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:21,393
Yeah, I'm going
to be fine.

800
00:42:21,502 --> 00:42:22,196
[Sniffles]

801
00:42:22,304 --> 00:42:23,794
Good night, Moira.

802
00:42:23,905 --> 00:42:25,338
Good night.

803
00:43:03,488 --> 00:43:05,149
[Computer chiming]

804
00:43:06,225 --> 00:43:07,385
Mmm?

805
00:43:13,134 --> 00:43:14,066
Mm-hmm.

806
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:18,868
[German accent]
Ah.

807
00:43:18,941 --> 00:43:20,203
Herr Edward.

808
00:43:20,277 --> 00:43:22,939
This is not
our usual meeting time.

809
00:43:24,415 --> 00:43:27,782
I am thinking
that perhaps you have been

810
00:43:27,853 --> 00:43:31,186
extra naughty
this week, yes?

811
00:43:31,257 --> 00:43:34,124
No, not really.

812
00:43:34,227 --> 00:43:35,489
No.

813
00:43:35,596 --> 00:43:40,000
Then what do I owe
the pleasure of this visit to?

814
00:43:40,101 --> 00:43:41,033
Hmm?

815
00:43:42,805 --> 00:43:44,796
I just wanted to talk,
if that's okay.

816
00:43:46,643 --> 00:43:48,372
[American accent]
Fair enough.

817
00:43:48,445 --> 00:43:50,037
What would you like
to talk about?

818
00:43:51,683 --> 00:43:54,208
I checked out that club
in Akron you recommended.

819
00:43:56,221 --> 00:43:56,983
[Small laugh]

820
00:43:57,056 --> 00:43:59,081
I recommended
a club in Akron?

821
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:00,626
Well, not exactly.

822
00:44:00,694 --> 00:44:05,428
You told me about a website
that listed gay clubs in Ohio.

823
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,194
When was this?

824
00:44:08,303 --> 00:44:09,964
A couple months ago.

825
00:44:10,073 --> 00:44:11,407
Huh.

826
00:44:11,407 --> 00:44:12,669
Okay.

827
00:44:12,742 --> 00:44:15,540
So how was the club?

828
00:44:15,612 --> 00:44:16,977
Terrible.

829
00:44:17,047 --> 00:44:17,672
Oh.

830
00:44:17,749 --> 00:44:19,273
Sorry to hear
about that.

831
00:44:19,384 --> 00:44:20,544
It wasn't your fault.

832
00:44:20,618 --> 00:44:22,347
No, I shouldn't
think so.

833
00:44:27,828 --> 00:44:29,989
So, uh,

834
00:44:30,064 --> 00:44:31,224
what was it
that you wanted?

835
00:44:31,299 --> 00:44:32,960
Do you ever think about me?

836
00:44:36,171 --> 00:44:37,297
[Laughs]

837
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:38,272
Excuse me?

838
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:41,003
I mean,

839
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:43,444
I know you must talk
to tons of guys every day,

840
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,778
and...

841
00:44:45,851 --> 00:44:48,718
I don't even know
your real name,

842
00:44:48,788 --> 00:44:50,757
but...

843
00:44:50,757 --> 00:44:52,122
Oh, God;
forget it.

844
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,557
Thanks.

845
00:45:00,736 --> 00:45:02,101
(John)
Oh, my God.

846
00:45:02,171 --> 00:45:03,433
(Moira)
Is that her?

847
00:45:03,507 --> 00:45:04,474
(John)
Right.

848
00:45:08,379 --> 00:45:09,107
Hey.
Hey.

849
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,442
Hi, hey.

850
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:14,549
Do you want
to sit down?

851
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:15,245
Yeah.

852
00:45:15,321 --> 00:45:16,447
Yeah?
Yeah.

853
00:45:16,523 --> 00:45:17,581
You must
be freezing.

854
00:45:17,657 --> 00:45:20,592
Hey, don't I know you
from somewhere?

855
00:45:20,661 --> 00:45:22,561
(John)
My roommate, Moe.

856
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:24,257
What are you,
the chaperone?

857
00:45:24,332 --> 00:45:25,356
[Laughs]

858
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:26,958
No, no, he's just
waiting with me.

859
00:45:27,036 --> 00:45:28,560
Am I late?

860
00:45:28,638 --> 00:45:29,605
No.

861
00:45:29,672 --> 00:45:30,604
No, not at all;
no.

862
00:45:44,524 --> 00:45:46,958
So...

863
00:45:47,028 --> 00:45:48,256
What do you
feel like doing?

864
00:45:50,032 --> 00:45:51,761
Hanging out's fine.

865
00:45:51,834 --> 00:45:52,960
I don't care.

866
00:45:53,035 --> 00:45:54,798
Great.

867
00:45:54,871 --> 00:45:56,606
I could go for a drink.

868
00:45:56,606 --> 00:45:57,436
Whatever.

869
00:45:57,508 --> 00:46:00,068
Yeah, right;
I'm sorry, of course.

870
00:46:00,177 --> 00:46:01,769
Uh, what would you like?

871
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:02,869
Do you, uh...

872
00:46:03,748 --> 00:46:04,271
red wine?

873
00:46:04,382 --> 00:46:05,314
[Jordan laughs]

874
00:46:05,384 --> 00:46:06,316
No.

875
00:46:06,385 --> 00:46:09,149
Actually, I'd kill
for a Cosmopolitan.

876
00:46:09,223 --> 00:46:10,155
Right, okay.

877
00:46:10,224 --> 00:46:11,282
Um, Moe?

878
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:13,417
I'm good, man.

879
00:46:13,495 --> 00:46:14,587
I'll be right back.
[Laughs]

880
00:46:19,301 --> 00:46:20,893
Do you have any
peppermint schnapps?

881
00:46:20,971 --> 00:46:22,996
(Moira)
Now, with all the good booze
in the world,

882
00:46:23,073 --> 00:46:24,700
why would you ever
drink that shit?

883
00:46:24,775 --> 00:46:25,867
Okay, what would
you recommend

884
00:46:25,943 --> 00:46:27,877
for a date that's
going up in flames?

885
00:46:27,945 --> 00:46:29,037
Manhattan.

886
00:46:29,114 --> 00:46:30,342
Fuel the fire.

887
00:46:30,415 --> 00:46:31,382
Really?

888
00:46:35,756 --> 00:46:36,688
Mmm, okay.

889
00:46:36,757 --> 00:46:38,622
One of those
and a Cosmopolitan.

890
00:46:41,096 --> 00:46:43,758
I like the butterfly
on your ass, by the way.

891
00:46:43,866 --> 00:46:45,424
Excuse me?

892
00:46:45,535 --> 00:46:47,662
Your tattoo.

893
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:48,760
I noticed it
the other day.

894
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:51,500
You were bending over
for a client, so...

895
00:46:51,576 --> 00:46:54,272
It's really good
ink work.

896
00:46:54,345 --> 00:46:55,312
Gee, thanks.

897
00:46:55,381 --> 00:46:56,348
[Both laugh]

898
00:46:58,852 --> 00:46:59,682
(Moira)
So,

899
00:46:59,753 --> 00:47:02,153
how do you
know Moe, anyway?

900
00:47:02,222 --> 00:47:03,484
College.

901
00:47:03,558 --> 00:47:04,820
And then I helped him

902
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:07,258
set up the technical side
of his business, and...

903
00:47:07,329 --> 00:47:08,728
[laughs]

904
00:47:08,797 --> 00:47:10,697
I saw what you did
for a living.

905
00:47:10,767 --> 00:47:12,462
Oh, Jesus, really?

906
00:47:12,535 --> 00:47:13,661
You saw Intercon-X?

907
00:47:13,736 --> 00:47:15,135
Oh, what?

908
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:18,542
Don't be a prude
about your own porno website.

909
00:47:18,543 --> 00:47:20,909
So Moe.

910
00:47:21,012 --> 00:47:22,036
Mmm?

911
00:47:22,148 --> 00:47:23,809
Is that a nickname?

912
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:26,477
Yeah, my real name's
Lawrence.

913
00:47:28,589 --> 00:47:29,681
Lawrence Curly?

914
00:47:29,757 --> 00:47:30,724
Yep.

915
00:47:33,294 --> 00:47:34,852
Larry Moe Curly.

916
00:47:36,365 --> 00:47:37,798
That's my name.

917
00:47:37,867 --> 00:47:38,834
Perfect.

918
00:47:38,902 --> 00:47:40,995
[Laughs]

919
00:47:41,071 --> 00:47:42,402
How much?

920
00:47:42,473 --> 00:47:44,907
On the house...

921
00:47:44,977 --> 00:47:45,944
prude.

922
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:53,942
All right, here we go.

923
00:47:54,054 --> 00:47:54,986
Thanks.

924
00:47:55,055 --> 00:47:56,420
Cosmo for you.

925
00:47:56,491 --> 00:47:57,253
Yes.

it's ridiculous...

What's the secret?

1153

Well, that's what
you wanted, right?

But what if he turns out to be
a total psycho or something?

1289
01:04:12,786 --> 01:04:15,050
You wouldn't
want that.

1290
01:04:15,122 --> 01:04:17,113
Nobody wants
a psycho.

01:04:17,192 --> 01:04:18,124
Tell me about it.

1292
01:04:18,193 --> 01:04:20,684

01:10:16,711 --> 01:10:17,643
What noise?

1463
01:10:17,712 --> 01:10:19,577
L- I think it's...

1464
01:10:19,648 --> 01:10:21,912
I think it's coming
from the TV...

1465
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:23,815
I can't stop it.

1466
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:25,013
[Clunks]
[Buzzing ceases]

1467
01:10:25,088 --> 01:10:26,555
Is that better?

1468
01:10:26,624 --> 01:10:27,556
Yeah.

1469
01:10:27,858 --> 01:10:28,882
[John sighs]

1470
01:10:28,959 --> 01:10:29,948
Thanks.

1471
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:34,262
[Breathes deeply]

1472

[Clears throat]

1473
01:10:37,003 --> 01:10:37,970
Huh.

1474
01:10:40,374 --> 01:10:42,774
So what did I miss?

1475
01:10:44,245 --> 01:10:47,476
Before or after
they pumped your stomach?

1476
01:10:47,583 --> 01:10:48,982
Ug.

1477
01:10:49,051 --> 01:10:51,485
Forget I asked.

1478
01:10:51,588 --> 01:10:53,055
[Exhales audibly]

1479
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:55,149
Um.

1480
01:10:55,226 --> 01:10:57,456
Moe's down
in the snack bar, so...

1481
01:10:57,529 --> 01:10:59,622
but they told us
you were still asleep.

1482
01:10:59,698 --> 01:11:01,427
Yeah, I just woke up.

1483
01:11:01,501 --> 01:11:02,832
Oh, right.

1484
01:11:02,902 --> 01:11:05,302
Okay, well, I'm going
to go down to the snack bar

1485
01:11:05,373 --> 01:11:06,897
and get him.

1486
01:11:08,409 --> 01:11:09,774
Well, wait.

1487
01:11:09,845 --> 01:11:11,506
I'm...

1488
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:14,549
I'd rather if you stayed
and talked to me for a little bit.

1489
01:11:15,585 --> 01:11:16,609
Oh, okay.

1490
01:11:16,687 --> 01:11:17,676
Sure.

1491
01:11:26,265 --> 01:11:28,426
Look, I don't know
what to say.

1492
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:33,400
Um, you know,
what I did...

1493
01:11:36,044 --> 01:11:38,205
I just never thought that...
I mean, that's just it.

1494
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:39,838
I never thought;
I just... I didn't, you know...

1495
01:11:39,916 --> 01:11:41,349
I didn't think.

1496
01:11:41,418 --> 01:11:43,352
Hey, this is not
your fault.

1497
01:11:44,755 --> 01:11:48,715
I mean, look,
I'm officially crazy.

1498
01:11:48,794 --> 01:11:50,489
Only in the state
of New York.

1499
01:11:52,598 --> 01:11:53,758
Yeah.

1500
01:11:57,471 --> 01:11:59,336
I really am sorry, Moira.

1501
01:12:01,042 --> 01:12:01,974
I know.

1502
01:12:06,149 --> 01:12:09,277
And if, you know,
there's anything...

1503
01:12:09,352 --> 01:12:11,718
anything I can do...

1504
01:12:11,789 --> 01:12:13,154
Thanks.

1505
01:12:13,224 --> 01:12:15,749
Don't be afraid to ask.

1506
01:12:15,828 --> 01:12:17,887
No, it's okay.

1507
01:12:17,964 --> 01:12:19,192
I'm okay now.

1508
01:12:21,067 --> 01:12:21,863
Yeah?

1509
01:12:21,936 --> 01:12:22,903
Mmm.

1510
01:12:29,077 --> 01:12:30,442
Huh.

1511
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:35,378
You know, my dad ended up
in a place like this.

1512
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:40,419
He would have me
sneak him booze

1513
01:12:40,492 --> 01:12:41,982
right here
in the hospital.

1514
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:47,427
Now that was a guy
that didn't want to stick around.

1515
01:12:49,504 --> 01:12:50,903
But that's not you, right?

1516
01:12:52,741 --> 01:12:53,765
No.

1517
01:12:57,313 --> 01:12:58,405
Good.

1518
01:13:00,017 --> 01:13:01,416
I'm glad.

1519
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:20,207
(John)
Okay, so according to this,

1520
01:13:20,276 --> 01:13:23,768
Doofus always takes the biggest slice of pie
for himself,

1521
01:13:23,847 --> 01:13:27,578
whereas Dandy always offers
the best slice to others.

1522
01:13:27,652 --> 01:13:29,813
Tsk; frigging Doofus.

1523
01:13:29,887 --> 01:13:30,819
I hate that guy.

1524
01:13:30,889 --> 01:13:31,913
Yeah.

1525
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:35,759
What... what itches?

1526
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:36,795
Your nose?

1527
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:40,489
How's that?

1528
01:13:40,601 --> 01:13:41,329
Thank you.

1529
01:13:41,402 --> 01:13:42,835
How about my chin does?

1530
01:13:42,904 --> 01:13:45,372
Your chin?

1531
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

1532
01:13:46,676 --> 01:13:48,109
Kind of my ear does too.

1533
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:48,608
Your ear?

1534
01:13:48,711 --> 01:13:49,609
No, other one.

1535
01:13:49,712 --> 01:13:50,770
Inside the ear or,
like, on the...

1536
01:13:50,881 --> 01:13:52,075
No.

01:13:52,182 --> 01:13:52,841
How's that?

1538
01:13:52,916 --> 01:13:54,178
That's good.

1539
01:13:54,252 --> 01:13:56,186
Thanks.

1540
01:13:56,287 --> 01:13:57,982
You know, people pay
good money to be tied up

1541
01:13:58,057 --> 01:13:59,456
and have their ears
scratched like that.

1542
01:13:59,525 --> 01:14:00,014
Oh, yeah?

1543
01:14:00,092 --> 01:14:01,855
Yeah, I saw it
on the internet.

1544
01:14:52,025 --> 01:14:53,492
Oh, shit.

1545
01:15:26,401 --> 01:15:28,335
Oh, yeah.

Hey.

Where's my monitor?

1552
01:16:07,819 --> 01:16:10,185
Oh, it got busted.

1553
01:16:10,256 --> 01:16:11,917
Oh, when you hucked
the bottle at it?

1554
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:16,352
Yeah, uh...

1555
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:19,632
Anyway.

1556
01:16:21,704 --> 01:16:23,331
How's Moira?

1557
01:16:23,405 --> 01:16:24,372
Fine.

1558
01:16:26,743 --> 01:16:28,301
What happened to you?

1559
01:16:28,379 --> 01:16:29,573
I left.

1560
01:16:29,647 --> 01:16:31,080
Yeah, we guessed that.

1561
01:16:32,618 --> 01:16:33,778
I know you're still mad.

1562
01:16:33,852 --> 01:16:35,649
I wasn't mad
until you attacked me.

1563
01:16:36,623 --> 01:16:39,148
Look, I'm sorry.

1564
01:16:39,226 --> 01:16:40,887
All right,
I was pissed off,

1565
01:16:40,961 --> 01:16:44,397
I was drunk,
and I overreacted.

1566
01:16:44,466 --> 01:16:45,433
Okay.

1567
01:16:50,306 --> 01:16:52,035
Still, that was
a shitty thing to do.

1568
01:16:54,077 --> 01:16:55,942
Excuse me?

like that.

talking about?

Hey, don't save it
for your website.

I'm standing right here.

1579
01:17:19,543 --> 01:17:20,510
All right.

1580
01:17:21,947 --> 01:17:24,381
Maybe I think Moira
deserves better than you.

1581
01:17:24,449 --> 01:17:26,246
Better.

1582
01:17:26,319 --> 01:17:27,343
And that would be you?

1583
01:17:29,423 --> 01:17:30,617
Maybe.

1584
01:17:35,096 --> 01:17:37,189
So, if you want
to split up the business

1585
01:17:37,299 --> 01:17:39,597
or buy me out
or whatever,

1586

with the numbers...

What?

1589
01:17:44,976 --> 01:17:47,570
We're potential
millionaires, remember?

1590
01:17:47,645 --> 01:17:48,873
Why fuck that up?

1591
01:17:53,987 --> 01:17:55,386
So we're still partners?

about that.

You got to check
this out, though.

This you will love.

Look, I got
to get us a beer; wait.

1600
01:18:19,219 --> 01:18:21,517
Hey, go pull up
the AngelCam screen.

1601
01:18:24,125 --> 01:18:28,825
Yo, I don't know
if I was hallucinating or what,

1602
01:18:28,897 --> 01:18:30,865
but the last time I checked,

1603
01:18:30,934 --> 01:18:36,703
there was this muffdiver
who looked exactly like Jordan.

1604
01:18:36,774 --> 01:18:39,607
Yeah, this chick
right here.

1605
01:18:41,813 --> 01:18:43,940

my ex-fiancee.

01:18:47,487 --> 01:18:48,419
Her?

1607
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,519
You were going
to marry her?

1608

Dude.

1609
01:19:15,756 --> 01:19:18,384
(John)
And, just like that,
it was over.

1610
01:19:20,128 --> 01:19:22,289
All those endless months
of missing you,

1611
01:19:23,699 --> 01:19:24,893
watching you,

1612
01:19:25,702 --> 01:19:27,169
dreaming about you;

1613
01:19:28,906 --> 01:19:30,271
but never hearing from you,

1614
01:19:31,609 --> 01:19:32,803
never talking with you,

1615
01:19:34,646 --> 01:19:35,840
never touching you.

[Electronic voice]
Are you available?

1618
01:19:59,478 --> 01:20:02,276
(John)
You were the ghost
in my machine,

1619
01:20:02,348 --> 01:20:04,680
and maybe
I was the ghost in yours.

1620
01:20:06,186 --> 01:20:08,984
It's much easier to love
an image than a real person.

1621
01:20:10,191 --> 01:20:13,319
But we all have a moment
where our life is divided,

1622
01:20:13,395 --> 01:20:14,487
like it or not,

1623
01:20:14,564 --> 01:20:17,158
into a before and an after.

1624
01:20:18,201 --> 01:20:20,260
Everything is different
from that moment on,

1625
01:20:21,305 --> 01:20:24,468
and everything before it
fades into the past.

1626
01:20:55,615 --> 01:20:57,845
I don't know how or why
a person stays in love

1627
01:20:57,918 --> 01:20:59,783
with a person who doesn't
love them back.

1628
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:02,821
Maybe it's hope,

1629
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:04,986
maybe it's nostalgia,

1630
01:21:06,429 --> 01:21:08,488
or maybe suckers like me
just have this love

1631
01:21:08,599 --> 01:21:09,964
and we have
to put it somewhere.

1632
01:21:12,102 --> 01:21:13,399
As long as you were alone,

1633
01:21:13,505 --> 01:21:16,338
I could bounce that love
off your image

1634
01:21:16,408 --> 01:21:17,841
like a mirror

1635
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:19,775
and somehow feel it
coming back to me.

1636
01:21:21,481 --> 01:21:23,244
But now I can't
even pretend anymore.

1637
