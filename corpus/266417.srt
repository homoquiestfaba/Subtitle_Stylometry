1
00:00:09,856 --> 00:00:12,484
( two loud guushots )

2
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:15,620
( men shouting and whooping )

3
00:00:15,662 --> 00:00:18,790
( battlefield gunfire )

4
00:00:20,934 --> 00:00:25,030
NARRATOR:
During the Civil War, the only
lawmen in Southern Texas--

5
00:00:25,072 --> 00:00:30,874
the Texas Rangers-- disbanded
to fight for the Confederacy.

6
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:35,211
Ranger Captain LeanderMcNelly
was also the local preacher.

7
00:00:35,248 --> 00:00:40,743
He left his family and ministry
to fight alongside his men.

8
00:00:40,787 --> 00:00:44,951
After the war, McNelly
returned to a defeated Texas

9
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:48,119
and found his wife
and three sous gone--

10
00:00:48,161 --> 00:00:51,255
taken by bandits.

11
00:00:51,298 --> 00:00:53,823
In the ten years
since the war's end

12
00:00:53,867 --> 00:00:56,062
bandits have overrun
southern Texas.

13
00:00:56,103 --> 00:00:59,595
Now, the governor
is looking for McNelly.

14
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:04,133
They say he wants to
recommission the Texas Rangers.

15
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:07,169
( thunder rumbling
in the distance )

16
00:01:07,214 --> 00:01:09,307
( man coughs )

17
00:01:11,385 --> 00:01:13,478
( grunting with effort )

18
00:01:21,928 --> 00:01:25,056
( thunder rumbling )

19
00:01:42,449 --> 00:01:44,508
( horse neighing )

20
00:01:50,857 --> 00:01:52,256
( horse whinnies )

21
00:02:04,037 --> 00:02:05,129
Leander...

22
00:02:05,172 --> 00:02:07,140
you know,
that's a right pretty spot

23
00:02:07,174 --> 00:02:08,869
for a resting place.

24
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:10,706
Who's the grave for?

25
00:02:10,744 --> 00:02:13,372
The grave's for me.

26
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:14,903
Wait too long

27
00:02:14,948 --> 00:02:16,745
ground'll be froze.

28
00:02:16,783 --> 00:02:20,549
Leander, come spend the winter
at my ranch.

29
00:02:20,587 --> 00:02:22,953
You rode down,
we'd have a place for you.

30
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:24,479
Be like old times.

31
00:02:24,524 --> 00:02:27,550
I don't reckon
I'll last the winter.

32
00:02:27,594 --> 00:02:29,824
Governor said
he sent some of his men.

33
00:02:29,863 --> 00:02:31,728
you wouldn't show at the door.

34
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:33,790
Said maybe you'd auswer for me.

35
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:36,962
The governor
just wants to talk with you.

36
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:38,561
you don't got to say

37
00:02:38,605 --> 00:02:41,130
yes or no
or it's a cold September.

38
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:44,075
All you got to do is see him,
Leander.

39
00:02:59,993 --> 00:03:02,826
( stagecoach rattling )

40
00:03:13,173 --> 00:03:15,505
Hyah! Hyah!

41
00:03:27,687 --> 00:03:30,315
And never underestimate
the importance of the name

42
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:31,949
that you choose for a product.

43
00:03:31,992 --> 00:03:33,118
"The Dunnison and Sous

44
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,024
"Automatic Drawer

45
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:36,995
for the Tabulation
of Financial Trausactious."

46
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,827
That just about tells the story,
doesn't it?

47
00:03:38,865 --> 00:03:40,799
Every shopkeeper in the country
will want one

48
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:42,461
( chuckling )
--before they even see it.

49
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:44,834
Well, that's good, because
the prototype doesn't work.

50
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:47,101
It's a prototype, son,
it's not supposed to work.

51
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,801
That's why they call it
a prototype.

52
00:03:48,842 --> 00:03:50,332
Look at this.

53
00:03:50,377 --> 00:03:52,038
I've already come np
with a solution

54
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:53,841
to the prob...

55
00:03:58,118 --> 00:03:59,813
It's for your mother.

56
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:02,822
Why didn't you mail it
while we were in Austin?

57
00:04:02,856 --> 00:04:04,687
you'll see.

58
00:04:12,198 --> 00:04:14,257
( men hollering and whistling )

59
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,766
( mooing )

60
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:32,277
Past 4:00, Marshall.

61
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,547
We should get started

62
00:04:33,587 --> 00:04:36,055
before these buyers
get even more nervous.

63
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:37,317
I got a bad feeling.

64
00:04:37,357 --> 00:04:39,723
you just got to border
country today, Marshall.

65
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,885
you'll get used to it.

66
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:42,292
Coming down.

67
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:45,264
There you go.

68
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:47,529
Lincoln!

69
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:51,061
Mother? Jake?

70
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:53,202
Oh, thank goodness.

71
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:54,638
Oh...

72
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:56,266
( chuckling )

73
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:57,435
Look how tall you've gotten.

74
00:04:57,477 --> 00:04:59,945
--Nice hat.
--Little brother.

75
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,641
What? you're going
to be a lawyer?

76
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:03,512
--I just might.
--How beautiful.

77
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,608
Oh, you still quick?

78
00:05:04,651 --> 00:05:06,881
Come on, boy.

79
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,512
( quiet laugh )

80
00:05:08,555 --> 00:05:09,613
( clanging )

81
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:13,991
I'd like to thank

82
00:05:14,027 --> 00:05:16,188
all of you for coming here today
for the first

83
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:17,787
of what we hope

84
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:18,991
will be many
cattle auctious

85
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:20,659
here in Las Coli...

86
00:05:24,304 --> 00:05:26,295
King Fisher.

87
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:28,170
( horse neighs )

88
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:34,512
( slow hoofbeats )

89
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:41,554
What's your business here,
Fisher?

90
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:43,351
Come for my beeves.

91
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,824
This here's an auction.

92
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:48,225
you're welcome to bid
when the time comes.

93
00:05:48,261 --> 00:05:50,161
I bid 50.

94
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:51,527
50 what?

95
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:52,690
50 of them.

96
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:55,098
( hoofbeats thundering )

97
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:09,376
( horses neighing )

98
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:21,118
( horses whinny and burr )

99
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:38,401
( guus cocking )

100
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,741
FISHER:
Marshall, I don't
think you understand.

101
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:49,346
around here,
I'm the law.

102
00:06:52,926 --> 00:06:55,451
Now, I'm taking
my beeves home.

103
00:06:57,897 --> 00:07:00,661
I can't let you
take these cattle.

104
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:06,034
( shouting and screaming )

105
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:08,632
( gunfire )

106
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:13,308
( screaming coutinues )

107
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,352
( towusfolk clamoring )

108
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:47,537
( men speaking indistinctly
in Spanish )

109
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,157
( chuckling quietly )

110
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:00,989
( woman screams )

111
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:03,427
( men yelling indistinctly
in Spanish )

112
00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:05,488
( guushot )

113
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:07,500
( woman shrieks )

114
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:11,369
MAN:
All right, all of you,
fan out!

115
00:08:11,404 --> 00:08:14,237
Come on! Come on!

116
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:18,104
Hyah!

117
00:08:18,144 --> 00:08:19,941
( whistling and shouting )

118
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,971
Come on, let's
get out of here!

119
00:08:23,883 --> 00:08:26,750
( crying quietly )

120
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:45,702
( iusects chirring )

121
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:54,246
( bird keening )

122
00:09:06,092 --> 00:09:09,459
( fire crackling )

123
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:11,588
( bird cawing )

124
00:09:27,614 --> 00:09:29,479
( man groaus )

125
00:09:44,931 --> 00:09:47,195
( floorplanks squeaking )

126
00:09:53,573 --> 00:09:55,939
Is anyone here?

127
00:10:09,822 --> 00:10:11,016
Don't move and I'll shoot!

128
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:14,591
Don't move and you'll shoot?

129
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:15,719
What does that mean?

130
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:17,821
If I don't move,
you're going to shoot me?

131
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:19,798
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

132
00:10:19,832 --> 00:10:22,596
My name is
Lincoln Rogers Dunnison.

133
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:26,799
you understand, I'm not
one of the men who did this...

134
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:30,434
so I'll be on my way.

135
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:33,343
( whimpering softly )

136
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:39,744
I can't lift it free.

137
00:10:39,786 --> 00:10:42,016
I can help you.

138
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:48,124
Put down the gun.

139
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:51,221
( hammer uncocks )

140
00:10:51,264 --> 00:10:52,788
I'm from Missouri.

141
00:10:52,832 --> 00:10:54,800
We was on a cattle drive

142
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:58,634
and stopped for supplies,
and we got ambushed.

143
00:10:58,671 --> 00:11:02,266
They stole all the cattle
and killed everybody.

144
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:03,832
Didn't kill you.

145
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:05,104
I was trapped...

146
00:11:05,144 --> 00:11:06,304
and they didn't see me

147
00:11:06,346 --> 00:11:08,041
and I'm damn lucky
that was the case

148
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:09,742
otherwise, I'd
be dead too.

149
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:12,012
So, where you headed?

150
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:13,313
Browusville.

151
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:15,913
Browusville?
What's there?

152
00:11:15,955 --> 00:11:18,355
Texas Rangers
are recruiting.

153
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:20,154
Texas Rangers?!

154
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:22,457
I'm going with you.

155
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,292
We'll get them bandits.

156
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,163
It's a long way
to Browusville.

157
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,395
I got a horse.

158
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,234
Name's George Durham.

159
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:52,057
( coyote howls )

160
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:57,122
( bird hooting )

161
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,291
Not so used

162
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:04,360
to sleeping under the stars,
are you?

163
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:07,339
( howling and barking )

164
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:16,410
Well...
there's nothing to it, really.

165
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:18,974
just, uh, dig yourself
a little hip hole

166
00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:20,280
and then you fill a bandanna

167
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:21,946
full of saw grass

168
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:25,424
and stick that
underneath your head.

169
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,552
It's the Lord's country,
Lincoln.

170
00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:32,655
Yeah... Lord's country.

171
00:12:32,698 --> 00:12:35,667
Land this beautiful...

172
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:38,067
ain't no wonder

173
00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:40,197
everybody's
killing over her.

174
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:44,601
( coyote howling )

175
00:12:44,644 --> 00:12:47,909
She's been here
a long time before us.

176
00:12:47,947 --> 00:12:49,141
She'll be here

177
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:52,709
a long time to come.

178
00:12:52,752 --> 00:12:56,415
you are a philosopher,
George Durham.

179
00:12:57,723 --> 00:12:59,452
( horses whinnying )

180
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:00,686
DRIVER:
Hyah!

181
00:13:08,101 --> 00:13:09,432
Brownsville.

182
00:13:17,777 --> 00:13:19,768
MAN:
We're going
to protect

183
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:22,508
you people,
least you can do

184
00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:23,981
is contribute supplies.

185
00:13:24,016 --> 00:13:25,608
you want a starving army?

186
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:28,119
Who's going to keep
the crops safe then?

187
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:28,984
you fellas there

188
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:30,648
grab all the grub
you can carry.

189
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,987
Get your irons and fall in.

190
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:33,719
We're riding south
to kill bandits!

191
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:45,563
( townsfolk murmuring )

192
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:49,673
Afternoon, Rangers.

193
00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:53,971
What's your business here?

194
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:55,412
By order of the community

195
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:57,609
I've got a vigilance committee
formed.

196
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,118
Nary a Yankee, nigger
or Mexican among us.

197
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:02,314
unless you have
the authority of the state

198
00:14:02,355 --> 00:14:03,913
disband and disarm these men.

199
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:05,548
They won't have it.

200
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:07,058
We aim to protect
our land.

201
00:14:07,093 --> 00:14:08,958
Men who want to protect
their land

202
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:10,758
they can apply to hire from me.

203
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:12,764
Governor's commissioned
the Rangers

204
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:14,766
to do the
protecting, mister.

205
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,769
Now, you disband these men.

206
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:22,205
you from San Antone?

207
00:14:23,242 --> 00:14:25,005
'Cause you
sure as hell

208
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:28,480
remind me
of this preacher there.

209
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:31,074
It was some years ago...

210
00:14:31,117 --> 00:14:33,051
some preacher man.

211
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:36,350
I don't recall no time
in San Antone.

212
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:38,448
No, I suppose you don't.

213
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,962
Men, you can keep your guns
to guard your homes

214
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:52,061
but that means
go home.

215
00:14:52,104 --> 00:14:53,594
( crowd murmuring )

216
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,540
I'll give you one minute
to take a vote.

217
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,621
Hey, Preacher...

218
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:17,060
vote's in.

219
00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:24,863
Preacher...

220
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:26,428
( gasping )

221
00:15:26,472 --> 00:15:28,133
say me last rites, Preacher

222
00:15:28,174 --> 00:15:30,165
before he takes me.

223
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:32,473
I ain't no preacher.

224
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:39,081
Company's making camp,
two nights in Brownsville.

225
00:15:39,118 --> 00:15:42,246
Any of you men interested
in taking on the star?

226
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:45,587
West end of town's
where you'll find us.

227
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,889
you look for me,
Leander McNelly

228
00:15:47,927 --> 00:15:49,087
or my associates

229
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:51,255
Sergeant
John Armstrong

230
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:52,730
or Frank Bones.

231
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:57,258
( snarling )

232
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:04,067
DRIVER:
Hyah, hyah!

233
00:16:07,213 --> 00:16:10,341
( wagon squeaking and rattling )

234
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:22,760
Whoa-whoa. Whoa.

235
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,133
?Habla ingles?

236
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,431
?Mexicano?

237
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:32,334
The big villas are north, yes?

238
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:34,066
you asking or telling?

239
00:16:34,106 --> 00:16:36,666
That is what we want.

240
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:39,075
I thought the cattles,
you drive them north, too.

241
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:40,840
With many peoples.

242
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,438
With iron trains.

243
00:16:42,481 --> 00:16:43,505
That is what we want.

244
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:44,777
These beeves
don't speak ingles.

245
00:16:44,817 --> 00:16:47,945
They speak, uh...
espanol.

246
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:49,318
( chuckling )

247
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:51,482
What do you want for her?

248
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:53,651
The tigre is not for sale,
senor.

249
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:54,751
What about her?

250
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:58,559
She is my wife, senor.

251
00:16:58,597 --> 00:16:59,689
What's she do?

252
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,697
What's she do?!

253
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:04,464
She acrobat, senor.

254
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:06,937
She spins and balances
and juggles.

255
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:08,769
Well, if she can juggle
three balls in the air

256
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:11,368
without dropping one of them,
you can keep your tomcat.

257
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,002
( chuckles )

258
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:18,674
Perdita, andele.

259
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:30,526
Mas alto.

260
00:17:30,563 --> 00:17:31,655
Mas alto, Perdita.

261
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:39,970
( screams )

262
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:41,233
Catch it!

263
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:51,809
Hyah!

264
00:17:54,387 --> 00:17:55,820
( screams )

265
00:17:59,425 --> 00:18:00,483
( gunshot )

266
00:18:00,526 --> 00:18:01,618
( chuckles )

267
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,797
Name?

268
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:10,426
Lincoln Rogers Dunnison.

269
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,504
Where you from,
Mr. Dunnison?

270
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:15,029
From Philadelphia, sir, as a boy

271
00:18:15,074 --> 00:18:17,838
but I spent the last three years
traveling with my father

272
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:19,003
a salesman and inventor.

273
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:20,341
Where's he now?

274
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:21,744
He's dead, sir.

275
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:23,749
He was shot down by bandits.

276
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:25,410
Ain't no revenge riding,
Mr. Dunnison.

277
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:27,351
Yes, sir.

278
00:18:27,386 --> 00:18:28,819
Saddle up.

279
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:35,086
When Frank here says
draw, you draw.

280
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:36,560
Takes longer than
a half a second

281
00:18:36,595 --> 00:18:37,857
means you're dead.

282
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:41,858
That Ranger badge
is your target.

283
00:18:56,348 --> 00:18:57,747
Sarsaparilla.

284
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:02,143
Most boys draw on sarsaparilla.

285
00:19:03,689 --> 00:19:04,986
Draw, damn it.

286
00:19:09,895 --> 00:19:11,487
The gun doesn't seem
to be loaded, sirs.

287
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,657
Son, you might want
to cock the hammer.

288
00:19:18,604 --> 00:19:20,299
How'd he do?

289
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:21,829
Nine seconds.

290
00:19:21,874 --> 00:19:23,341
Seen worse.

291
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,468
Gentlemen, you've been gracious
to grant me your time.

292
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:27,035
I wish you the best
in your endeavors.

293
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,747
Give my best to Philadelphia.

294
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:36,115
just so there are
no hard feelings either way

295
00:19:36,155 --> 00:19:38,680
I didn't come here
for a mouth's pay

296
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:40,055
or to execute
some bandits

297
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:41,286
like they did
my family.

298
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:43,227
I came here
because you sent out for men

299
00:19:43,262 --> 00:19:44,889
who wanted to protect
their land.

300
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,989
I have no land
but the patch

301
00:19:47,032 --> 00:19:48,363
my own two feet stand on

302
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,766
but I would want that land
to be lawful, sir.

303
00:19:50,803 --> 00:19:54,204
you put that down in writing,
Mr. Dunnison?

304
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,639
Sir?

305
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:57,266
That high-minded talk.

306
00:19:57,309 --> 00:19:59,106
you write like that, too?

307
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:02,580
In English, French or Latin?

308
00:20:02,615 --> 00:20:05,209
Well, shit, Mr. Dunnison.

309
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:07,947
I only know Spanish,
Cherokee and Comanche.

310
00:20:07,987 --> 00:20:11,115
$40 a mouth in a state scrip
and found.

311
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:13,317
you'll get your pay
from Sergeant Armstrong.

312
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,883
you'll get your orders
from me.

313
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:16,952
We'll sell you the boots,
sell you a gun

314
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:18,224
sell you a steed.

315
00:20:18,264 --> 00:20:20,129
but it'll run you $40,
Mr. Dunnison

316
00:20:20,165 --> 00:20:22,633
so you better last a mouth...

317
00:20:22,668 --> 00:20:25,831
'cause you're in debt to me
already.

318
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:29,631
Here you are.

319
00:20:29,675 --> 00:20:30,835
Thanks.

320
00:20:33,145 --> 00:20:34,840
Wear it proud, son.

321
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:49,054
Sergeant.

322
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,489
( stnttering ):
Name's Sam from
S-S-San Antone.

323
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:55,591
I never been
to S-S-San Antone.

324
00:20:55,634 --> 00:20:57,067
Randolph Douglas Scipio

325
00:20:57,102 --> 00:20:59,002
from around
the Texarkana way.

326
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:00,733
My daddy staked
some land out there.

327
00:21:00,773 --> 00:21:02,673
Turned out to find himself
a copper mine

328
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,608
so they killed my daddy.

329
00:21:04,643 --> 00:21:06,907
you shouldn't be able
to just shoot a man

330
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:08,004
and claim his land.

331
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:09,344
Yeah.

332
00:21:09,381 --> 00:21:10,575
Yeah, I aim to
change that.

333
00:21:10,616 --> 00:21:12,106
So, uh, Sergeant say

334
00:21:12,151 --> 00:21:14,847
whether he'll use you as
a rifleman or a scout?

335
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:17,549
A rifleman or a scout?

336
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,922
Well, every white
boy I met yet

337
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:22,587
says Sergeant
made him a rifleman.

338
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:24,789
Every colored, like me

339
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,628
Sergeant made a scout.

340
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,031
Well, every war
I ever heard of

341
00:21:29,068 --> 00:21:30,763
scouts get killed
before the shooters

342
00:21:30,803 --> 00:21:33,135
'cause they're the stupid son
of a bitches sent out front.

343
00:21:33,172 --> 00:21:35,140
And if I don't meet
some white boy scouts soon

344
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:37,904
President Grant's
going to be hearing from me.

345
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:39,410
Sure.

346
00:21:39,445 --> 00:21:41,675
A strongly worded letter's
always best.

347
00:21:41,714 --> 00:21:44,478
They say I'm a scout?

348
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:46,882
you see this star here?

349
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:51,488
I'm gonna show them
I'm a shooter.

350
00:21:51,523 --> 00:21:53,957
Dunnison.

351
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:57,028
What do you think, huh?

352
00:21:57,062 --> 00:21:58,222
( snorts )

353
00:21:58,263 --> 00:22:00,128
George!

354
00:22:00,165 --> 00:22:02,099
Lincoln! Lincoln!

355
00:22:02,134 --> 00:22:03,158
Lincoln!

356
00:22:03,202 --> 00:22:04,430
We're Rangers!

357
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,528
We made it!

358
00:22:05,571 --> 00:22:07,402
( laughing )

359
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:09,304
We're not sleeping
under the stars.

360
00:22:09,341 --> 00:22:10,467
We got a tent.

361
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:11,840
Oh, it's nice, too.

362
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:13,469
you got to see it.

363
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:14,501
( laughing )

364
00:22:14,546 --> 00:22:15,843
It's a tent!

365
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:18,111
I got my be...
I'm on the left!

366
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,414
BONES:
Fisher's been splitting

367
00:22:20,452 --> 00:22:21,942
his men into several bands.

368
00:22:21,987 --> 00:22:23,614
They've been
raiding ranches

369
00:22:23,656 --> 00:22:25,647
all along this trail
on the way to Mexico.

370
00:22:25,691 --> 00:22:28,216
GnARD:
Captain? Mr. Dunnison's
reporting, sir.

371
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,488
Send him in.

372
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:30,927
Captain.

373
00:22:30,963 --> 00:22:32,624
Sergeant said
you wanted to see me.

374
00:22:32,665 --> 00:22:33,996
Thanks, Frank.

375
00:22:36,535 --> 00:22:39,936
Take a seat, Mr. Dunnison.

376
00:22:39,972 --> 00:22:42,270
Notebook and pen are yours.

377
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:48,940
Every word I say,
you write it down.

378
00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:51,472
Something slips by,
slow me down.

379
00:22:51,517 --> 00:22:53,508
Understood, sir.

380
00:22:53,552 --> 00:22:56,282
October 26.

381
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:58,186
Company now
fully outfitted

382
00:22:58,223 --> 00:23:00,248
with 30 men,
orphans mostly.

383
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:01,816
youngest 15.

384
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,091
We'll leave tomorrow
and train on the trail.

385
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:08,065
Fisher split his men
into smaller raiding parties.

386
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,830
Lord hope that we're
not attacked directly.

387
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:12,530
( McNelly coughing )

388
00:23:12,571 --> 00:23:15,062
Scant trail
experience

389
00:23:15,107 --> 00:23:17,701
weakness with weapons...

390
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:20,610
Expect desertions along the way.

391
00:23:20,646 --> 00:23:25,083
Expect... expect most of
these boys will not survive.

392
00:23:29,221 --> 00:23:31,689
( coughing )

393
00:23:31,724 --> 00:23:33,021
Sir?

394
00:23:34,793 --> 00:23:36,351
I'm capable
of writing

395
00:23:36,395 --> 00:23:38,727
my reports to the government,
Mr. Dunnison.

396
00:23:38,764 --> 00:23:40,857
but there will come a time
when I am not.

397
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:43,493
I'd rather have you
in the habit.

398
00:23:46,338 --> 00:23:48,499
( coughing )

399
00:23:56,381 --> 00:23:58,679
( gasping )

400
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:08,587
The Lord is coming for me,
Mr. Dunnison.

401
00:24:08,627 --> 00:24:12,529
Sir, then why ride?

402
00:24:12,564 --> 00:24:16,330
I figure it's better
I walk to meet Him...

403
00:24:17,803 --> 00:24:21,034
...than sit and wait.

404
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:26,239
Hey.

405
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:28,803
What'd the captain want?

406
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:36,882
He's dying.

407
00:24:36,922 --> 00:24:41,120
Our captain is dying.

408
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,891
Rangers!

409
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:46,489
Our mission is to stop

410
00:24:46,532 --> 00:24:48,796
the outlaw John King Fisher.

411
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:51,530
Fisher and his men
have been burning ranches

412
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,232
thieving cattle and
driving them into Mexico

413
00:24:54,273 --> 00:24:56,366
where he sells them
to the Mexican army.

414
00:24:56,408 --> 00:24:58,638
More than a million
beeves stolen.

415
00:24:58,677 --> 00:25:00,975
More than
400 men murdered.

416
00:25:01,013 --> 00:25:03,447
We'll be patrolling
border country

417
00:25:03,482 --> 00:25:05,313
to find these animals,
bring them to justice.

418
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,443
U.S. Cavalry's
got a mandate

419
00:25:07,486 --> 00:25:09,477
to settle Indian matters.

420
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:12,012
Leaves us to protect
the Texan way.

421
00:25:12,057 --> 00:25:13,718
It's our home, Rangers

422
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:16,193
and we got right
on our side.

423
00:25:16,228 --> 00:25:18,219
Ain't no outlaw
stands a fighting chance!

424
00:25:18,263 --> 00:25:19,594
( gunshots )

425
00:25:19,631 --> 00:25:21,861
( cheering and whooping )

426
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:35,439
( crowd cheering )

427
00:25:49,595 --> 00:25:52,758
( cheering coutinues )

428
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:09,506
( bridle clanking )

429
00:26:25,063 --> 00:26:27,293
( horse burring )

430
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,368
Back up, recruit!

431
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:42,141
This ain't no
goddamn pony ride.

432
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,772
Who you calling recruit?

433
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:45,180
you're a Browusville sign-up.

434
00:26:45,217 --> 00:26:46,912
I seen you. I been a Ranger
since Franklin.

435
00:26:46,952 --> 00:26:48,579
That's a week and two days.

436
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,554
I know about life on the trail.

437
00:26:50,589 --> 00:26:52,420
One more week, you'll be
eligible for retirement.

438
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:53,583
Watch it, recruit.

439
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:55,115
I'll shoot that lip off
at 40 paces.

440
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,958
Name's Berry.
Berry Smith.

441
00:26:57,996 --> 00:27:00,157
Berry? Like blueberry?

442
00:27:00,198 --> 00:27:01,529
Like elderberry to you.

443
00:27:01,566 --> 00:27:03,227
Sergeant sent me
to fill out the dab.

444
00:27:03,268 --> 00:27:05,566
Dab's a usual
three or four Rangers.

445
00:27:05,604 --> 00:27:07,003
We eat together, scout together.

446
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,701
It's us three
and Sandoval.

447
00:27:09,741 --> 00:27:10,901
He's dab leader.

448
00:27:10,943 --> 00:27:12,535
Means we care
for his horse

449
00:27:12,577 --> 00:27:13,874
care for his weapons.

450
00:27:13,912 --> 00:27:17,177
( gunshots )

451
00:27:17,215 --> 00:27:21,242
( whooping and cheering )

452
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,427
( gunshot )

453
00:27:38,103 --> 00:27:40,833
Boy rides a horse like
he's riding his sister.

454
00:27:40,872 --> 00:27:42,806
He knows he's doing
something wrong.

455
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:46,004
Ten cents says
he's saddle sore.

456
00:27:46,044 --> 00:27:48,239
20 cents says he's
dead by Sunday.

457
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,770
Ain't taking that bet.

458
00:27:54,619 --> 00:27:57,281
Anybody see the way this scout
killed those bandits?

459
00:27:57,322 --> 00:27:58,516
Anybody see the way
this scout

460
00:27:58,557 --> 00:28:00,047
killed those bandits?

461
00:28:03,395 --> 00:28:05,886
( rapid gunfire )

462
00:28:05,931 --> 00:28:07,762
Damn!

463
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,494
Sam, I'll bet you I can draw

464
00:28:09,534 --> 00:28:11,866
faster than you can say
"peppercorn."

465
00:28:11,903 --> 00:28:12,767
Peppercorn.

466
00:28:12,804 --> 00:28:13,532
just say it.

467
00:28:13,572 --> 00:28:15,199
Pep-pep-pep-pep-pep...

468
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,435
( gunshots )

469
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:20,373
Fast!

470
00:28:20,412 --> 00:28:22,073
I'm fast, I'm fast

471
00:28:22,114 --> 00:28:24,173
--I'm fast!
--So fast you're six feet under.

472
00:28:24,216 --> 00:28:26,241
Missed that target
every time, Mr. Durham.

473
00:28:26,284 --> 00:28:28,616
gun's no good unless
you got smarts with it.

474
00:28:28,653 --> 00:28:29,711
Yes, sir, Captain.

475
00:28:29,755 --> 00:28:30,813
Frank, from now on

476
00:28:30,856 --> 00:28:33,450
Mr. Durham pays
for his ammunition.

477
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:35,221
A penny a miss.

478
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,522
Yes, sir, Captain.

479
00:28:44,836 --> 00:28:45,860
( gunshots )

480
00:28:45,904 --> 00:28:47,838
( tin can falling )

481
00:28:55,113 --> 00:28:58,549
Peppercorn.

482
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:02,485
FISHER:
I'm telling you,
General Cortinas

483
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:04,887
the Republic of Texas
is there for the taking.

484
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:08,256
What you're suggesting
is full-scale war.

485
00:29:08,293 --> 00:29:10,261
The union Army's up north,
fighting the Indians.

486
00:29:10,295 --> 00:29:11,990
Hell, there ain't no law
south of Austin.

487
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,361
We heard McNelly's
been commissioned

488
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:14,365
to start up the Rangers.

489
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,594
McNelly's got 30 men,
General, 30.

490
00:29:16,635 --> 00:29:17,727
We'd have an army.

491
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:24,707
For the next shipment, senor...

492
00:29:24,743 --> 00:29:27,177
we will meet you.

493
00:29:29,948 --> 00:29:31,779
--Shit!
--Damn, Dunnison.

494
00:29:31,817 --> 00:29:33,614
Ain't there anything
you're good at?

495
00:29:33,652 --> 00:29:35,552
I'd love to show you, Scipio,
but I don't think

496
00:29:35,587 --> 00:29:37,316
we'll be meeting any women
along the way.

497
00:29:37,355 --> 00:29:39,255
Dunnison, you rope
yourself a woman

498
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:42,522
I'll drink the Rio Grande.

499
00:29:42,561 --> 00:29:43,994
( laughing )

500
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:45,621
( chuckling )

501
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:57,600
you want something, Sam?

502
00:29:57,642 --> 00:30:00,873
( stuttering ):
When you're wri-wri-writing

503
00:30:00,912 --> 00:30:03,005
for the Captain in his tent

504
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:07,314
you see any ma-ma-maps in there?

505
00:30:07,352 --> 00:30:08,944
Maps?

506
00:30:08,987 --> 00:30:14,015
I seen the ma-maps he s-studies
with the s-sergeant

507
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:15,424
and they're pretty b-b-b...

508
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,826
Bad, Sam?

509
00:30:17,863 --> 00:30:19,490
Mm-hmm.

510
00:30:19,531 --> 00:30:21,761
My pa-pa-papa taught me

511
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,827
how to blaze t-t-trails
and k-k-keep maps.

512
00:30:25,871 --> 00:30:28,271
Might be
wo-wo-worthwhile

513
00:30:28,306 --> 00:30:30,866
having somebody
to ma-ma-make maps

514
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:32,467
of the t-t-territory

515
00:30:32,511 --> 00:30:34,411
while we ride.

516
00:30:34,446 --> 00:30:36,937
Dunnison:
Captain, Mr. Walters
was speaking to me

517
00:30:36,982 --> 00:30:39,109
about the charts and maps
you're working with

518
00:30:39,151 --> 00:30:40,778
and he wanted
to present you

519
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:43,219
with what we think
is a preferable scenario.

520
00:30:43,255 --> 00:30:44,745
Sam.

521
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:48,156
W-W-Well...

522
00:30:48,193 --> 00:30:51,026
Captain, I w-w-wanted

523
00:30:51,062 --> 00:30:54,031
to s-s-see...

524
00:30:54,065 --> 00:30:57,193
I w-wanted to s-see

525
00:30:57,235 --> 00:30:58,600
if you're the kind of man

526
00:30:58,637 --> 00:31:00,434
who'd beg for his
life like a dog

527
00:31:00,472 --> 00:31:03,066
or swallow the bullet
like a sorry soldier.

528
00:31:03,108 --> 00:31:05,599
( grunts and groans )

529
00:31:05,644 --> 00:31:08,204
Stay down!
Stay down, you son of a bitch.

530
00:31:10,348 --> 00:31:11,246
Well...

531
00:31:11,283 --> 00:31:13,843
Captain Cutthroat McNelly--

532
00:31:13,885 --> 00:31:16,752
the man the whole union
Army conldn't kill.

533
00:31:16,788 --> 00:31:19,279
Shot down by Sam Walters

534
00:31:19,324 --> 00:31:20,518
of San Antone.

535
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,856
Fisher knows

536
00:31:21,893 --> 00:31:23,588
you're riding the Rangers,
Captain.

537
00:31:23,628 --> 00:31:25,391
He's put a sweet price
on your sad hide.

538
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,726
( pained groaning )

539
00:31:27,766 --> 00:31:28,926
Suck my spurs,
you secretary!

540
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:31,299
I brought a bullet
for you, too.

541
00:31:32,537 --> 00:31:33,902
Turn around, McNelly.

542
00:31:33,939 --> 00:31:35,702
And stop your shifting
or I'll shoot.

543
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,904
Brave Sam Walters--
shot McNelly in the back.

544
00:31:39,945 --> 00:31:41,173
( groaning )

545
00:31:41,213 --> 00:31:43,545
How's that
for a storybook?

546
00:31:43,582 --> 00:31:45,948
Turn around, McNelly.

547
00:31:45,984 --> 00:31:48,043
Right in the back,
Sam shot him.

548
00:31:48,086 --> 00:31:49,485
Right in the back.

549
00:31:49,521 --> 00:31:50,920
I said

550
00:31:50,956 --> 00:31:52,014
turn around!

551
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:56,719
( gasps )

552
00:32:04,502 --> 00:32:07,994

553
00:32:20,652 --> 00:32:23,519
( sighs quietly )

554
00:32:31,796 --> 00:32:33,525
( clicks tongne )

555
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:35,192
( horse whinnies )

556
00:32:36,668 --> 00:32:39,296
you riding somewheres,
Mr. Dunnison?

557
00:32:40,605 --> 00:32:42,596
Riding out
of Ranger Company, sir.

558
00:32:42,641 --> 00:32:44,973
Company's captain

559
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,274
was nearly killed
due to my conduct.

560
00:32:47,312 --> 00:32:50,440
I don't presume myself welcome
to wear this anymore.

561
00:32:53,418 --> 00:32:57,013
Were you set to ride off
with that horse, Mr. Dunnison?

562
00:32:57,055 --> 00:32:58,989
That's a Ranger's horse.

563
00:32:59,024 --> 00:33:01,652
I was hoping I would not be
sent away without a horse, sir.

564
00:33:01,693 --> 00:33:03,490
but hoping to be sent away?

565
00:33:03,528 --> 00:33:08,397
you were nearly killed,
and I was the reason.

566
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:10,458
I hired Sam Walters on,
Mr. Dunnison.

567
00:33:10,502 --> 00:33:12,060
He stood my scrutiny.

568
00:33:12,103 --> 00:33:14,765
He could've taken his shot at me
at any time.

569
00:33:14,806 --> 00:33:17,297
He had 30 Rangers shined on,
not just you.

570
00:33:17,342 --> 00:33:19,435
Rangers' horse,
Mr. Dunnison.

571
00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:22,446
you ride out,
that horse is stolen.

572
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,607
My men will hunt you down.

573
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:28,016
Rangers' boots, Rangers'
clothes, Rangers' weapons.

574
00:33:28,053 --> 00:33:30,613
you walk out,
makes them stolen, too.

575
00:33:30,655 --> 00:33:32,452
So it seems to me,
Mr. Dunnison

576
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:34,424
the only way you
escape a warrant

577
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:36,120
is to remain a Ranger.

578
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:48,902
( hooves thundering )

579
00:33:59,217 --> 00:34:02,118
Fisher keeps an outpost
around this mesa.

580
00:34:02,153 --> 00:34:05,088
Freshwater spring
on the other side.

581
00:34:05,123 --> 00:34:08,388
Water for the horses when
they come from raids.

582
00:34:08,426 --> 00:34:11,259
but do we know
how many?

583
00:34:11,296 --> 00:34:12,820
shouldn't we know how many?

584
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,229
Round that mesa

585
00:34:14,265 --> 00:34:15,892
they'll spot us
well too soon.

586
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:17,299
Need to send a patrol.

587
00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:21,362
Berry, Durham, Dunnison

588
00:34:21,406 --> 00:34:22,737
ride with Sandoval and me.

589
00:34:22,774 --> 00:34:25,504
Taking a scout, Captain?

590
00:34:27,112 --> 00:34:28,773
Get yourself shot.

591
00:34:28,813 --> 00:34:31,179
Scipio, go get yourself shot.

592
00:34:31,216 --> 00:34:34,049
And don't get shot second;
get shot first, Scipio.

593
00:34:34,085 --> 00:34:36,144
In fact, shoot yourself, Scipio.

594
00:34:36,187 --> 00:34:37,916
Get it over with.

595
00:34:37,956 --> 00:34:40,390
That's the Rangers' way.

596
00:34:40,425 --> 00:34:43,053
( men talking in distance )

597
00:34:59,778 --> 00:35:02,838
( horse approaching )

598
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:06,974
Five men. Fisher's men, sir.

599
00:35:07,018 --> 00:35:09,578
Armed, and they got
a supply wagon.

600
00:35:10,622 --> 00:35:12,487
--Sandoval.
--Yes, sir.

601
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:15,688
our mission is

602
00:35:15,727 --> 00:35:17,388
to capture these men
at all costs.

603
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:19,727
but I want the cost
to be on their side.

604
00:35:19,764 --> 00:35:21,493
When the shooting starts,
these targets

605
00:35:21,533 --> 00:35:23,262
will be shooting back--
not like practice, men.

606
00:35:23,301 --> 00:35:24,928
Anyone surrenders,
we question them

607
00:35:24,969 --> 00:35:26,561
then send them to
Austin for trial.

608
00:35:26,604 --> 00:35:27,798
Remember...

609
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,103
you hesitate, you're dead.

610
00:35:32,911 --> 00:35:35,812
( neighing )

611
00:35:39,818 --> 00:35:42,116
( neighs )

612
00:35:44,255 --> 00:35:46,553
Where are you wandering
off to, huh?

613
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:47,853
Cheval, huh?

614
00:35:47,892 --> 00:35:49,655
What woman

615
00:35:49,694 --> 00:35:50,956
lost hold of you, huh?

616
00:35:50,995 --> 00:35:53,395
Drop your guns! Stay down!

617
00:35:53,431 --> 00:35:54,796
Texas Rangers!

618
00:35:57,068 --> 00:35:58,626
Say your prayers,
sons of bitches!

619
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,432
Ambush!

620
00:36:08,646 --> 00:36:09,806
( neighing )

621
00:36:14,085 --> 00:36:16,212
( yelling )

622
00:36:33,638 --> 00:36:37,130
Someone throw me a cartridge!
I'm out!

623
00:36:37,175 --> 00:36:38,972
Someone throw me

624
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,238
a cartridge!

625
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,079
Found one.

626
00:36:55,126 --> 00:36:56,753
Wha... uh...

627
00:36:58,596 --> 00:37:00,291
( yells )

628
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:02,231
( crying )

629
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:09,707
( both groaning )

630
00:37:13,044 --> 00:37:14,341
( rapid gunfire )
--Get down!

631
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:32,655
you said there were
five men! Five!

632
00:37:32,697 --> 00:37:34,062
I ain't no scout!

633
00:37:34,098 --> 00:37:35,497
you hear me?
I ain't no scout!

634
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:36,830
I'm a dag-blasted shooter!

635
00:37:36,868 --> 00:37:37,926
Give me that!

636
00:37:47,245 --> 00:37:49,076
We surrender.

637
00:37:49,113 --> 00:37:51,013
We surrender.

638
00:37:53,785 --> 00:37:55,275
( sighs )

639
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,346
So, ladies, where to next?

640
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:01,358
Say your names.

641
00:38:01,392 --> 00:38:03,326
Anton Marsele,
from New Orleans.

642
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:05,352
Jean-Pierre Marsele.
Son frere.

643
00:38:05,396 --> 00:38:08,058
Marsele brothers.

644
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:10,761
Horse thievery
and livestock

645
00:38:10,802 --> 00:38:12,827
extortion of
merchants and widows

646
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,565
kidnapping...

647
00:38:14,606 --> 00:38:17,006
destruction
of property.

648
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:18,736
you boys should've stayed
in New Orleans.

649
00:38:18,776 --> 00:38:20,437
Why don't you give us
some more to write in here?

650
00:38:22,547 --> 00:38:24,242
( men gasping, horses neighing )

651
00:38:24,282 --> 00:38:26,182
Attendez! Attendez! Attendez!

652
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:27,206
We rode for King Fisher.

653
00:38:27,251 --> 00:38:28,650
The saddles were stole

654
00:38:28,686 --> 00:38:30,415
from Sutter Ranch
in Austin.

655
00:38:30,455 --> 00:38:32,116
With cattle, 400 head.

656
00:38:32,156 --> 00:38:34,590
Ten ranch hands died
at the Sutter Ranch.

657
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:35,820
We kill no one.

658
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,191
Fisher did.

659
00:38:37,228 --> 00:38:38,388
We work for you now.

660
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:39,418
--For you.
-- Oui.

661
00:38:39,464 --> 00:38:41,329
you work for the Rangers
as a spy?

662
00:38:41,366 --> 00:38:42,833
-- Oui.
-- Oui. Oni, for the Rangers.

663
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:43,925
For the Rangers.

664
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,401
Ca va marcher,
ca va marcher.

665
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:46,835
Ils savent pas
a propos des antres.

666
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:48,338
C'etait pas marqne
daus le mandat.

667
00:38:48,373 --> 00:38:50,102
Mr. Dunnison?

668
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:52,268
--Sir?
--What'd they say?

669
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,676
They said, "This will work,
this will work.

670
00:38:54,712 --> 00:38:56,612
"They don't know
about the others.

671
00:38:56,648 --> 00:38:58,741
It wasn't in the warrants."

672
00:39:01,686 --> 00:39:02,948
Sandoval.

673
00:39:04,322 --> 00:39:06,950
( men gasping, horses neighing )

674
00:39:08,626 --> 00:39:11,288
( choking and gasping )

675
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,994
These bandits
went down shooting.

676
00:39:15,033 --> 00:39:16,557
Surrender never crossed
their minds.

677
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:18,626
Their rules, not mine.

678
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,194
but I'll play by them.

679
00:39:20,238 --> 00:39:22,069
We're Rangers, men.

680
00:39:22,106 --> 00:39:25,507
We got right
on our side.

681
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:31,139
Scipio.

682
00:39:35,286 --> 00:39:37,777
Treat her fine...

683
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:39,346
rifleman.

684
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:46,862
Dunnison:
you said we would take
those men prisoner

685
00:39:46,898 --> 00:39:49,423
take them to Austin,
take them to trial.

686
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:51,992
We did the trial.

687
00:39:52,036 --> 00:39:53,663
That was no trial.

688
00:39:53,705 --> 00:39:57,698
A trial can run a long
time, Mr. Dunnison.

689
00:39:57,742 --> 00:39:59,835
Some can run
up to a year.

690
00:40:03,681 --> 00:40:06,377
A year is something
I do not have.

691
00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:08,248
In the state of Texas,
killers hang.

692
00:40:08,286 --> 00:40:10,880
And if they're not killers,
but we think they're killers

693
00:40:10,922 --> 00:40:13,618
and we don't even stop
to check the warrants?

694
00:40:13,658 --> 00:40:16,092
How long will the war go on...

695
00:40:16,127 --> 00:40:18,186
preacher?

696
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,730
until the wicked are dead

697
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:27,033
and the meek shall
inherit the earth.

698
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:29,369
Are we the meek?

699
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:32,774
The meek will inherit the earth,
Mr. Dunnison.

700
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:36,302
Someone's got to go
and get it ready for them.

701
00:40:36,347 --> 00:40:38,474
There are bodies

702
00:40:38,516 --> 00:40:40,950
to be buried.

703
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:42,680
Bury them.

704
00:40:51,662 --> 00:40:53,630
( coughs and spits )

705
00:40:57,969 --> 00:41:00,199
( retching )

706
00:41:00,238 --> 00:41:02,331
( flies buzzing )

707
00:41:15,953 --> 00:41:17,944
Some kind of work, ain't it?

708
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:22,153
We done killed six men dead.

709
00:41:22,193 --> 00:41:25,924
We ain't even got our $40 yet.

710
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,900
( hooves thundering )

711
00:41:41,946 --> 00:41:46,110
< <

712
00:42:06,904 --> 00:42:09,668
Cattle come through here.

713
00:42:09,707 --> 00:42:12,005
100, maybe 200.

714
00:42:17,748 --> 00:42:21,047
Whoa, now! Get on back!

715
00:42:25,723 --> 00:42:29,318
Rangers got
the Marsele brothers.

716
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,089
What about the gun?

717
00:42:31,128 --> 00:42:33,358
McNelly destroyed it.

718
00:42:34,632 --> 00:42:36,122
Damn.

719
00:42:42,573 --> 00:42:44,234
30 men and horses.

720
00:42:44,275 --> 00:42:46,266
about a hundred beeves.

721
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:48,870
you know that's
marshland prairie, Captain.

722
00:42:48,913 --> 00:42:52,076
Might want to track them
to a little better terrain.

723
00:42:52,116 --> 00:42:54,641
No better terrain for 20 miles.

724
00:42:54,685 --> 00:42:57,381
And better for us
means better for them.

725
00:42:57,421 --> 00:42:58,615
Might be better to wait.

726
00:42:58,656 --> 00:43:01,147
Wait till what,
they reach reinforcements?

727
00:43:01,192 --> 00:43:02,523
Sandoval??

728
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:07,520
30 of them, 30 of us.

729
00:43:07,565 --> 00:43:11,626
We wait...
they may have 300.

730
00:43:19,243 --> 00:43:22,269
We'll ride
at full gallop.

731
00:43:22,313 --> 00:43:23,871
They'll see us
on the prairie

732
00:43:23,915 --> 00:43:25,473
and take
defensive positions.

733
00:43:25,516 --> 00:43:27,347
Shoot at the target
forward of you only

734
00:43:27,385 --> 00:43:28,374
and you keep shooting

735
00:43:28,419 --> 00:43:30,910
till you taste that
outlaw's blood.

736
00:43:30,955 --> 00:43:33,389
No prisoners, Rangers.

737
00:43:55,479 --> 00:43:58,880
( men shouting )

738
00:44:04,922 --> 00:44:05,616
Fire!

739
00:44:25,843 --> 00:44:27,310
Hyah!

740
00:44:29,613 --> 00:44:30,841
Get every last one!

741
00:44:38,689 --> 00:44:39,883
( screaming )

742
00:44:39,924 --> 00:44:42,119
Get the others out of hiding.

743
00:44:49,133 --> 00:44:51,101
Let's go, boys!

744
00:44:51,135 --> 00:44:55,401
( all shouting )

745
00:44:55,439 --> 00:44:57,498
( gunshots coutinue )

746
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:06,748
Jesus Christ.

747
00:45:14,525 --> 00:45:15,617
( horse whinnies )

748
00:45:18,162 --> 00:45:20,027
( grunting )

749
00:45:24,368 --> 00:45:26,199
We don't have the manpower.

750
00:45:26,237 --> 00:45:28,034
They set us up!
We're trapped!

751
00:45:30,474 --> 00:45:31,839
( screaming )

752
00:45:31,876 --> 00:45:32,638
( neighs )

753
00:45:32,676 --> 00:45:33,768
( screaming )

754
00:45:38,482 --> 00:45:39,676
( screaming )

755
00:45:43,587 --> 00:45:45,452
Goddamn.

756
00:45:45,489 --> 00:45:47,389
( yells )

757
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:49,986
( horse whinnies )

758
00:45:53,731 --> 00:45:55,096
God, not me.

759
00:45:55,132 --> 00:45:57,930
Oh, please God!

760
00:45:57,968 --> 00:45:59,458
Oye, muchacho, por aca.

761
00:46:01,939 --> 00:46:02,769
Stand back!

762
00:46:02,807 --> 00:46:04,104
Stand back!

763
00:46:05,976 --> 00:46:07,443
Don't move!

764
00:46:10,181 --> 00:46:12,706
Oh, God! Oh, God! Get up!

765
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,183
( gun cocking )

766
00:46:17,488 --> 00:46:18,785
( horse whinnies )

767
00:46:24,261 --> 00:46:26,388
Leave them alone!

768
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:27,920
Their dead alone!

769
00:46:30,935 --> 00:46:31,765
( groans )

770
00:46:43,114 --> 00:46:44,206
No!

771
00:46:49,653 --> 00:46:51,348
Sergeant!

772
00:46:51,388 --> 00:46:52,753
I'm getting you
out of here.

773
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:55,122
Help me! I surrender!

774
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:56,251
Help me!

775
00:46:56,293 --> 00:46:57,453
I surrender!

776
00:46:57,495 --> 00:46:58,427
Help me!

777
00:46:58,462 --> 00:47:00,430
I surren--

778
00:47:02,299 --> 00:47:03,630
Retreat, Rangers!

779
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:04,929
Retreat!

780
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,970
( gunshot rings out )

781
00:47:25,156 --> 00:47:27,021
Durham:
Thank God!

782
00:47:27,057 --> 00:47:28,046
We're retreating!

783
00:47:28,092 --> 00:47:29,992
Come on!
We're retreating!

784
00:47:30,027 --> 00:47:31,324
We're retreating!

785
00:47:31,362 --> 00:47:32,522
Giddup! Let's go!

786
00:47:41,872 --> 00:47:44,170
Next time you train your Rangers

787
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:45,641
train them
how to run!

788
00:47:45,676 --> 00:47:47,610
Go with God, McNelly.

789
00:47:47,645 --> 00:47:50,443
If the son of a bitch
will have you.

790
00:47:52,716 --> 00:47:55,014
Ride.

791
00:47:55,052 --> 00:47:56,849
( horse whinnies )

792
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:08,623
( birds chirping )

793
00:48:13,204 --> 00:48:16,503
( chirping coutinues )

794
00:48:30,588 --> 00:48:33,648
( whispers ):
Thank you very much.

795
00:48:46,904 --> 00:48:50,362
Fisher will have
ridden on by dusk.

796
00:48:50,407 --> 00:48:53,205
We'll return to Palo Alto...

797
00:48:53,244 --> 00:48:55,804
get our men.

798
00:48:55,846 --> 00:48:58,542
We'll resupply
and get new recruits

799
00:48:58,582 --> 00:49:00,550
at the ranch
of my old friend

800
00:49:00,584 --> 00:49:01,881
Richard Dukes.

801
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,162
What'd they do with our men?

802
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:24,569
Cap...

803
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,529
Cut my men down.

804
00:49:46,563 --> 00:49:49,123
Cut them down.

805
00:50:00,611 --> 00:50:02,806
Jesus...

806
00:50:14,358 --> 00:50:15,552
Captain!

807
00:50:15,592 --> 00:50:17,617
or favor...

808
00:50:17,661 --> 00:50:18,628
kill me.

809
00:50:18,662 --> 00:50:19,788
Captain!

810
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:21,161
Kill me now.

811
00:50:21,198 --> 00:50:22,460
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

812
00:50:22,499 --> 00:50:24,763
Slow and easy,
?comprende?

813
00:50:24,802 --> 00:50:26,963
Nice and easy,
little lady.

814
00:50:27,004 --> 00:50:28,301
your war's over.

815
00:50:30,808 --> 00:50:32,742
Slow and easy.

816
00:50:48,892 --> 00:50:51,452
( men yelling and whistling )

817
00:50:51,495 --> 00:50:53,087
MAN:
Riders coming in!

818
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:54,427
Ready yourselves!

819
00:50:54,465 --> 00:50:56,865
Begging your pardon,
Mrs. Dukes.

820
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,629
There's riders, Captain.

821
00:51:10,814 --> 00:51:13,647
Whoa.

822
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:21,715
Are those the Rangers,
Daddy?

823
00:51:21,759 --> 00:51:24,023
Caroline,
take your sisters inside.

824
00:51:24,061 --> 00:51:25,688
Come on, girls.
There's going to be

825
00:51:25,729 --> 00:51:27,287
a lot of dirty cowboys around.

826
00:51:33,904 --> 00:51:36,634
Got 12 men to bury.

827
00:51:58,862 --> 00:52:02,161
you want to say
some words, Leander?

828
00:52:18,182 --> 00:52:20,309
( sniffling )

829
00:52:24,321 --> 00:52:25,754
WOMAN:
you're welcome, sir.

830
00:52:25,789 --> 00:52:27,381
( indistinct conversation )

831
00:52:32,162 --> 00:52:34,528
Oh, thank you,
ma'am.

832
00:52:34,565 --> 00:52:36,556
No, no.

833
00:52:41,205 --> 00:52:43,139
( belches )

834
00:52:43,173 --> 00:52:45,004
Thank you, ma'am.

835
00:52:45,042 --> 00:52:46,566
Tom?

836
00:52:49,947 --> 00:52:51,915
wouldn't be so bad
to be a ranch hand

837
00:52:51,949 --> 00:52:53,143
around here,
would it?

838
00:52:53,183 --> 00:52:54,741
Probably don't
get shot at much.

839
00:52:54,785 --> 00:52:56,252
I wouldn't even
mind, as long

840
00:52:56,286 --> 00:52:58,083
as it was her
doing the shooting.

841
00:52:58,121 --> 00:52:59,418
( laughing )

842
00:52:59,456 --> 00:53:01,321
Durham:
up there earlier

843
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:04,919
she was studying me
like an encyclopedia.

844
00:53:04,962 --> 00:53:07,931
I hate to disappoint you,
George, but she was eyeing me.

845
00:53:07,965 --> 00:53:09,455
( laughing ):
The hell she was!

846
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,990
She was. She was studying me
like a Bible.

847
00:53:11,034 --> 00:53:13,093
Well, you study an encyclopedia
a lot harder

848
00:53:13,136 --> 00:53:14,694
than you study a Bible, Lincoln.

849
00:53:14,738 --> 00:53:16,399
Get all that buckshot
out of your ass yet?

850
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,067
Ten more minutes.

851
00:53:18,108 --> 00:53:19,632
Ten more minutes
is about how long

852
00:53:19,676 --> 00:53:21,303
you got to live,
unless you give up

853
00:53:21,345 --> 00:53:23,074
that bath to the man who
could've killed you

854
00:53:23,113 --> 00:53:24,444
when he met you.

855
00:53:24,481 --> 00:53:26,039
George, you couldn't kill
a bottle of mescal

856
00:53:26,083 --> 00:53:28,210
--with a pack of Mexicans.
--Give up the bath.

857
00:53:28,252 --> 00:53:29,583
What the hell are you doing?

858
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,781
--Get the hell out of here!
--Give up the bath!

859
00:53:31,822 --> 00:53:34,450
Have a seat, sonny.
just stay on your side!

860
00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:44,961
Oh, you had
to see that.

861
00:53:45,002 --> 00:53:46,970
She was eyeing me.

862
00:53:47,004 --> 00:53:49,165
( horse whinnies )

863
00:53:52,643 --> 00:53:54,133
( knock at door )

864
00:53:54,177 --> 00:53:55,838
Come in.

865
00:53:57,848 --> 00:53:59,839
Mr. Dunnison.

866
00:54:03,754 --> 00:54:05,847
( McNelly coughs )

867
00:54:10,794 --> 00:54:13,558
November 17.

868
00:54:13,597 --> 00:54:16,896
The men fought bravely,
but I believe it was my mistake

869
00:54:16,934 --> 00:54:19,425
to lead them into a battle
on such arduous terrain.

870
00:54:21,171 --> 00:54:23,537
With no natural defencements,
they were unprepared

871
00:54:23,574 --> 00:54:25,565
to withstand
such a pitched encounter.

872
00:54:25,609 --> 00:54:28,237
I had believed that the numbers
were in our favor.

873
00:54:28,278 --> 00:54:29,939
I had believed that the raiders

874
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,447
would not be as
well-disciplined

875
00:54:31,481 --> 00:54:33,540
as they were.

876
00:54:35,652 --> 00:54:38,621
It was a disastrous decision.

877
00:54:45,629 --> 00:54:48,029
would you agree with that,
Mr. Dunnison?

878
00:54:50,901 --> 00:54:52,960
Dunnison:
It's awfully
kind of you, Miss

879
00:54:53,003 --> 00:54:55,096
to be taking care of
such wrecks like us.

880
00:54:55,138 --> 00:54:56,366
Awfully kind.

881
00:54:56,406 --> 00:54:58,237
Well, it must've been hard.

882
00:54:58,275 --> 00:55:00,641
Were many young like you?

883
00:55:00,677 --> 00:55:02,872
Rest assured, Miss,
we didn't go down
without a fight.

884
00:55:02,913 --> 00:55:04,938
I killed two raiders
myself at close range.

885
00:55:04,982 --> 00:55:07,177
I may have killed a couple
more in the charge.

886
00:55:09,353 --> 00:55:10,786
What were their names?

887
00:55:10,821 --> 00:55:12,584
Pardon?

888
00:55:12,623 --> 00:55:14,352
you had warrants for them,
I trust.

889
00:55:14,391 --> 00:55:16,359
Well, the raiders opened
fire on us, Miss.

890
00:55:16,393 --> 00:55:18,452
There wasn't time to
consult the warrants.

891
00:55:18,495 --> 00:55:19,860
Well, it's just as well.

892
00:55:19,896 --> 00:55:21,659
you know a man's name,
makes it harder

893
00:55:21,698 --> 00:55:22,790
to kill him,
now, doesn't it?

894
00:55:22,833 --> 00:55:24,460
They're outlaws, Miss.

895
00:55:24,501 --> 00:55:26,059
We're Rangers.

896
00:55:26,103 --> 00:55:28,298
When you kill a man
for stealing some cattle

897
00:55:28,338 --> 00:55:31,034
you are saying that his life
is worth as much as that steer.

898
00:55:31,074 --> 00:55:33,565
Leaves you a whole state
full of men thinking that way

899
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:35,441
and treating other men
the same.

900
00:55:35,479 --> 00:55:39,074
We ride to protect
the state of Texas.

901
00:55:39,116 --> 00:55:41,311
you ride to balance
the blood on the scales.

902
00:55:41,351 --> 00:55:44,377
but some of you--

903
00:55:44,421 --> 00:55:46,412
like your friend--

904
00:55:46,456 --> 00:55:48,822
I look into his eyes,
and I can see it clear.

905
00:55:48,859 --> 00:55:50,121
He's no killer.

906
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,993
George? you looked in his eyes?

907
00:55:54,398 --> 00:55:56,628
( chuckling ):
George?!

908
00:55:59,603 --> 00:56:01,662
Durham:
Miss.

909
00:56:01,705 --> 00:56:03,263
Ladies.

910
00:56:03,306 --> 00:56:04,500
Hey.

911
00:56:04,541 --> 00:56:05,769
you talking to her?

912
00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:08,642
I got nowhere,
George.

913
00:56:08,679 --> 00:56:10,112
Gunslingers.

914
00:56:10,147 --> 00:56:12,342
She likes
gunslingers.

915
00:56:20,524 --> 00:56:23,960
( horses neighing )

916
00:56:23,994 --> 00:56:26,121
Sergeant, what's going on?

917
00:56:26,163 --> 00:56:28,859
Training exercises,
it looks like.

918
00:56:28,899 --> 00:56:30,298
Who organized this?

919
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:31,630
Philadelphia did.

920
00:56:31,668 --> 00:56:32,930
about damn time.

921
00:56:34,738 --> 00:56:36,330
Peppercorn.

922
00:56:42,112 --> 00:56:44,580
State'll pay you $40 a mouth.

923
00:56:44,614 --> 00:56:46,479
Four men to a dab.

924
00:56:46,516 --> 00:56:48,245
Seven dabs to a company.

925
00:56:48,285 --> 00:56:50,344
you get your pay
from Sergeant Armstrong.

926
00:56:51,822 --> 00:56:53,619
you get your orders from me.

927
00:56:53,657 --> 00:56:54,521
Fire!

928
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:08,100
( whooping )

929
00:57:20,417 --> 00:57:23,250
( indistinct conversation )

930
00:57:36,733 --> 00:57:39,258
Senorita.

931
00:57:42,873 --> 00:57:44,864
Si.

932
00:57:47,477 --> 00:57:49,672
La Senora wanted you
to have these.

933
00:57:49,713 --> 00:57:51,237
They're yours to keep.

934
00:57:51,281 --> 00:57:54,250
you're safe now.

935
00:57:54,284 --> 00:57:56,149
you're with the Rangers.

936
00:57:56,186 --> 00:57:57,915
Those devils
can't hurt you anymore.

937
00:57:57,954 --> 00:57:59,717
Who say they cannot hurt me
no more?

938
00:57:59,756 --> 00:58:02,224
John Armstrong says.

939
00:58:07,697 --> 00:58:09,255
Senora is...

940
00:58:09,299 --> 00:58:11,199
very kind.

941
00:58:15,205 --> 00:58:16,536
( sniffing )

942
00:58:19,409 --> 00:58:21,138
Who were those men?

943
00:58:21,178 --> 00:58:23,908
Name to me
the devils that hurt you.

944
00:58:25,782 --> 00:58:28,649
We're after those men.

945
00:58:30,253 --> 00:58:32,721
I heard them say they were going
to Amargosa

946
00:58:32,756 --> 00:58:36,248
to do a raid at
the Logan ranch.

947
00:58:42,833 --> 00:58:43,891
( kissing softly )

948
00:58:46,636 --> 00:58:48,797
Thank you.

949
00:58:54,344 --> 00:58:56,369
ARMSTRONG:
Come on, recruits,
let's get ready to move out!

950
00:58:56,413 --> 00:58:58,711
Come on, pack it up!

951
00:58:58,748 --> 00:59:01,808
Let's get ready
to move out, boys.

952
00:59:03,486 --> 00:59:05,386
Let's pack her up!

953
00:59:08,859 --> 00:59:10,827
Saying good-bye?

954
00:59:13,496 --> 00:59:14,963
We, uh...

955
00:59:14,998 --> 00:59:17,899
shot five bandits
over at Palo Alto.

956
00:59:17,934 --> 00:59:20,732
Well, I mean...

957
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:22,397
I killed.

958
00:59:22,439 --> 00:59:23,667
Judy didn't.

959
00:59:25,008 --> 00:59:27,841
but I was
riding Judy.

960
00:59:27,878 --> 00:59:30,472
Hell, they was dead before they
even saw me draw. Blam, blam!

961
00:59:30,513 --> 00:59:33,641
George, sell it
in the dime stores.

962
00:59:38,755 --> 00:59:42,782
She'd... make
a good ranch horse.

963
00:59:42,826 --> 00:59:46,557
I think you'd make
a good ranch hand.

964
00:59:49,532 --> 00:59:51,159
Dunnison:
Miss Dnkes

965
00:59:51,201 --> 00:59:53,135
hope he hasn't tired you
with all his stories:

966
00:59:53,169 --> 00:59:55,660
all the bad men he's killed,
the hangings, the shoot-outs.

967
00:59:55,705 --> 00:59:57,536
It's so hard
to keep track.

968
00:59:57,574 --> 00:59:59,667
Actually, we were speaking
of a horse.

969
00:59:59,709 --> 01:00:02,371
He killed a horse?

970
01:00:02,412 --> 01:00:03,538
( horse burrs )

971
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:05,013
Miss Dukes.

972
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,013
McNELLY:
Amargosa's a
40-mile ride

973
01:00:12,055 --> 01:00:14,046
but we'll make it
by nightfall.

974
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:15,318
Send a man
into Shepardton.

975
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:16,791
Get a telegram
to Victor Logan.

976
01:00:16,826 --> 01:00:18,691
Tell him to get his
family out of there.

977
01:00:18,728 --> 01:00:20,025
And the Rangers are coming.

978
01:00:20,063 --> 01:00:22,463
( horse neighs )

979
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:29,838
I made the lady a
promise, Captain.

980
01:00:29,873 --> 01:00:32,808
We're taking her
to Carmargo.

981
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:38,642
Hyah.

982
01:00:54,097 --> 01:00:56,224
( cattle lowing )

983
01:01:02,772 --> 01:01:04,933
( lowing in distance )

984
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:24,956
Another hour

985
01:01:24,995 --> 01:01:26,860
and it's sunup.

986
01:01:26,896 --> 01:01:29,763
Any sign over there?

987
01:01:29,799 --> 01:01:31,824
Dust, Captain.

988
01:01:31,868 --> 01:01:34,132
Dust and sky.

989
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:36,468
Night... why
wouldn't they

990
01:01:36,506 --> 01:01:37,768
raid at night?

991
01:01:45,448 --> 01:01:47,109
She wasn't dead.

992
01:01:49,486 --> 01:01:50,680
I don't follow.

993
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,654
The rest were dead.

994
01:01:52,689 --> 01:01:54,987
And she wasn't.

995
01:01:55,025 --> 01:01:56,458
So why'd they leave her behind?

996
01:01:59,362 --> 01:02:01,330
Hey, Captain!

997
01:02:01,364 --> 01:02:03,457
Captain, wait up!

998
01:02:04,968 --> 01:02:05,992
( gasps )

999
01:02:06,036 --> 01:02:07,003
They let you live! Why?

1000
01:02:07,037 --> 01:02:08,595
To say what? What?!

1001
01:02:08,638 --> 01:02:10,230
--Stop! you're scaring her!
--Amargosa?

1002
01:02:10,273 --> 01:02:11,501
Le diije qne no se!

1003
01:02:11,541 --> 01:02:13,566
Captain, she told you
what she heard them say!

1004
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:15,874
What they wanted her
to hear!

1005
01:02:15,912 --> 01:02:19,040
What they wanted her to say!

1006
01:02:20,717 --> 01:02:23,845
Rangers!

1007
01:02:23,887 --> 01:02:26,822
( sobbing )

1008
01:02:28,691 --> 01:02:30,318
Men, we are riding back
to Dukes.

1009
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,759
Dunnison, Donavan, Scipio

1010
01:02:31,795 --> 01:02:33,660
stay behind
with Sergeant Armstrong.

1011
01:02:33,696 --> 01:02:35,721
Take Perdita
as our prisoner.

1012
01:02:35,765 --> 01:02:37,596
Yeah, but what if
they still raid?

1013
01:02:37,634 --> 01:02:39,124
We're not at the raid,
goddamn it!

1014
01:02:39,169 --> 01:02:41,194
The raid can only be
at the Dukes Ranch!

1015
01:02:41,237 --> 01:02:43,228
Hyah. Hyah!

1016
01:02:43,273 --> 01:02:46,003
( horse whinnying )

1017
01:02:59,856 --> 01:03:01,881
( creaking in wind )

1018
01:03:01,925 --> 01:03:03,984
( horse neighs in distance )

1019
01:03:05,829 --> 01:03:08,491
( gunfire, galloping hooves )

1020
01:03:08,531 --> 01:03:10,328
( men shouting )

1021
01:03:10,366 --> 01:03:11,856
( gunfire coutinues )

1022
01:03:14,204 --> 01:03:17,367
Perdita.

1023
01:03:17,407 --> 01:03:18,806
you didn't know.

1024
01:03:18,842 --> 01:03:21,037
you conldn't have.

1025
01:03:24,047 --> 01:03:26,880
Please forgive me.

1026
01:03:27,884 --> 01:03:29,476
( groans )

1027
01:03:31,154 --> 01:03:33,281
( grunting )

1028
01:03:40,563 --> 01:03:43,088
Hyah! Hyah!

1029
01:03:43,133 --> 01:03:44,623
Andale, mas rapido!

1030
01:03:44,667 --> 01:03:46,532
Ho! Ho!

1031
01:03:48,471 --> 01:03:50,701
Rapido, ho!

1032
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:52,264
( groaning )

1033
01:03:52,308 --> 01:03:53,935
Duncan!

1034
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:06,211
Scipio!

1035
01:04:06,256 --> 01:04:08,053
Hyah!

1036
01:04:08,091 --> 01:04:09,319
Hyah! Hyah!

1037
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:11,224
( horse neighs )

1038
01:04:11,261 --> 01:04:14,458
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

1039
01:04:14,497 --> 01:04:16,260
Yo, andale.

1040
01:04:18,835 --> 01:04:21,167
Yo, andale.

1041
01:04:22,605 --> 01:04:23,629
1Andale!

1042
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:26,266
1Arriba, arriba!

1043
01:04:28,178 --> 01:04:30,237
1Andale!

1044
01:04:32,115 --> 01:04:33,582
Hyah! Hyah!

1045
01:04:33,616 --> 01:04:34,878
Hyah!

1046
01:04:34,918 --> 01:04:36,510
Hyah!

1047
01:04:36,553 --> 01:04:37,383
( horse whinnies )

1048
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:38,978
( grunts )

1049
01:04:40,690 --> 01:04:43,955
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1050
01:04:43,993 --> 01:04:45,426
( whimpers )

1051
01:04:45,461 --> 01:04:46,792
Kill me, teijano.

1052
01:04:46,829 --> 01:04:48,990
you want to kill me,
kill me!

1053
01:04:49,032 --> 01:04:50,727
--Or do you want
to have me first?
--I don't want

1054
01:04:50,767 --> 01:04:52,928
to kill you and I don't want to
hurt you-- I want to know why.

1055
01:04:52,969 --> 01:04:55,563
They know I'm from Carmargo.
They are riding to Los Cuevas.

1056
01:04:55,605 --> 01:04:58,073
They say if I don't say
Amargosa, they kill mi familia.

1057
01:04:58,107 --> 01:04:59,836
Tonight?
They ride tonight?

1058
01:04:59,876 --> 01:05:02,037
I say Amargosa for
mi padre, mi madre...

1059
01:05:02,078 --> 01:05:03,511
( hoofbeats )
--Where are they?

1060
01:05:03,546 --> 01:05:04,535
They're riding
for Mexico

1061
01:05:04,581 --> 01:05:06,071
crossing at Los Cuevas.

1062
01:05:06,115 --> 01:05:07,480
Tell George
to get word

1063
01:05:07,517 --> 01:05:08,506
to the company.

1064
01:05:08,551 --> 01:05:09,779
We're taking to the trail.

1065
01:05:09,819 --> 01:05:10,513
Who taking the trail??

1066
01:05:10,553 --> 01:05:11,986
you and I-- Mexico.

1067
01:05:23,499 --> 01:05:24,796
Richard!

1068
01:05:24,834 --> 01:05:26,267
( horse neighs )

1069
01:05:26,302 --> 01:05:28,600
Richard!

1070
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,645
( hammers cocking )

1071
01:05:38,681 --> 01:05:41,775
( sighs )

1072
01:05:41,818 --> 01:05:43,547
Where's Richard?

1073
01:06:03,706 --> 01:06:05,731
( cattle lowing )

1074
01:06:05,775 --> 01:06:08,539
( men whistling )

1075
01:06:13,016 --> 01:06:14,745
Rangers!

1076
01:06:18,454 --> 01:06:19,648
Drive the herd!

1077
01:06:26,496 --> 01:06:28,487
These are Mexican beeves now!

1078
01:06:28,531 --> 01:06:29,657
And the man is

1079
01:06:29,699 --> 01:06:32,497
a Mexican man.

1080
01:06:42,011 --> 01:06:44,172
( hooves thundering )

1081
01:07:08,705 --> 01:07:10,866
Captain Leander McNelly.

1082
01:07:11,908 --> 01:07:13,739
I've been waiting for you.

1083
01:07:13,776 --> 01:07:15,607
The young
soldier there

1084
01:07:15,645 --> 01:07:17,545
has been talking my
ear off since dawn

1085
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:20,640
trying to work
himself a trade.

1086
01:07:20,683 --> 01:07:22,583
One Mexican juggler

1087
01:07:22,618 --> 01:07:24,279
for one Texas clown.

1088
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:27,084
you send Captain Dukes
across that river

1089
01:07:27,123 --> 01:07:29,489
we'll send your girl.

1090
01:07:29,525 --> 01:07:30,958
you have my word.

1091
01:07:30,993 --> 01:07:32,688
I could use a man
like you, Captain--

1092
01:07:32,729 --> 01:07:36,460
a man who can shoot,
a man of his word.

1093
01:07:36,499 --> 01:07:40,060
Man could live like a king
in Mexico.

1094
01:07:40,103 --> 01:07:42,094
If I was your wife
and boys

1095
01:07:42,138 --> 01:07:44,868
Mexico's where I would have
hightailed it by now

1096
01:07:44,907 --> 01:07:48,206
instead of waiting
for a killer like you.

1097
01:07:48,244 --> 01:07:51,304
Maybe they're here now,
McNelly...

1098
01:07:51,347 --> 01:07:54,475
living like kings in Mexico.

1099
01:07:54,517 --> 01:07:57,452
Captain Dukes for the girl.

1100
01:07:57,487 --> 01:08:00,320
He means nothing to you.

1101
01:08:00,356 --> 01:08:02,085
Ah, but he means something
to you.

1102
01:08:09,065 --> 01:08:11,158
Richard!

1103
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,259
Now we send her!

1104
01:08:13,302 --> 01:08:15,793
--No!
--Stand down, Mr. Dunnison.

1105
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:18,102
Dunnison:
What she did was
to save her family.

1106
01:08:18,141 --> 01:08:19,768
She's a victim, not an outlaw.

1107
01:08:19,809 --> 01:08:22,039
Stand down...

1108
01:08:22,078 --> 01:08:23,978
or be shot.

1109
01:08:24,013 --> 01:08:26,345
This is not
what Rangers do.

1110
01:08:26,382 --> 01:08:28,373
Captain, show them

1111
01:08:28,418 --> 01:08:31,353
the difference between them
and us.

1112
01:08:35,958 --> 01:08:38,552
Stand down, Dunnison.

1113
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:03,848
The state of Texas commands you

1114
01:09:03,886 --> 01:09:07,049
to leave its lands
now and forever.

1115
01:09:07,089 --> 01:09:10,252
you will be prosecuted
and imprisoned

1116
01:09:10,293 --> 01:09:12,557
should you
ever return.

1117
01:09:12,595 --> 01:09:14,495
( gun uncocking )

1118
01:09:19,535 --> 01:09:22,868
May God have mercy on your sonl.

1119
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,459
PERDITA:
I did what you say!

1120
01:09:53,503 --> 01:09:56,028
Yeah, and you'll do what I say
tonight, and you'll do

1121
01:09:56,072 --> 01:09:57,300
what I say tomorrow.

1122
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:59,467
Maybe one day
we'll charge admission.

1123
01:09:59,509 --> 01:10:01,067
( whips knife )

1124
01:10:01,344 --> 01:10:03,904
( guitar musicplaying )

1125
01:10:07,783 --> 01:10:09,546
( cattle lowing )

1126
01:10:20,563 --> 01:10:23,293
Don't know which
I want to do worse:

1127
01:10:23,332 --> 01:10:26,426
kill the son of
a bitch up there...

1128
01:10:26,469 --> 01:10:29,905
or go teach him
how to play.

1129
01:10:29,939 --> 01:10:32,737
McNELLY:
Take up your pen, Mr. Dunnison.

1130
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:35,736
No notebook, sir?

1131
01:10:35,778 --> 01:10:37,609
Take up your pen.

1132
01:10:40,616 --> 01:10:44,108
November 19.

1133
01:10:44,153 --> 01:10:48,021
I, Leander McNelly,
being of sound mind

1134
01:10:48,057 --> 01:10:50,548
do hereby bequeath
my land and property

1135
01:10:50,593 --> 01:10:54,723
to the Texas Rangers

1136
01:10:54,764 --> 01:10:56,994
to do as
they see fit.

1137
01:10:57,033 --> 01:10:59,501
The following
items excepted:

1138
01:10:59,535 --> 01:11:02,095
my Navy Colts,
field glasses

1139
01:11:02,138 --> 01:11:07,041
and books
on military strategy...

1140
01:11:07,076 --> 01:11:08,873
to Lincoln Rogers Dunnison--

1141
01:11:11,247 --> 01:11:15,183
a soldier fit to lead.

1142
01:11:15,217 --> 01:11:19,347
My Bible I would like
to be buried with.

1143
01:11:19,388 --> 01:11:21,288
That is all.

1144
01:11:24,527 --> 01:11:26,620
( writing )

1145
01:11:26,662 --> 01:11:28,493
( pen clinks into inkwell )

1146
01:11:28,531 --> 01:11:29,930
Sir...

1147
01:11:29,966 --> 01:11:33,333
In that fort will be
far more than 30 men.

1148
01:11:33,369 --> 01:11:35,667
They'll never expect us
to cross

1149
01:11:35,705 --> 01:11:37,332
into Mexico.

1150
01:11:37,373 --> 01:11:40,570
They'll be well-armed
and well-provisioned.

1151
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:42,237
They've been riding
for weeks, sir.

1152
01:11:42,278 --> 01:11:43,643
It's their first night back.

1153
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:46,307
The women, the liquor...
they'll crave sleep.

1154
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,756
( McNelly coughing )

1155
01:11:58,027 --> 01:12:00,552
( retching )

1156
01:12:03,165 --> 01:12:05,929
Bones, start your men
at the front gates.

1157
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,069
Baker.

1158
01:12:19,115 --> 01:12:20,377
Yes, sir.

1159
01:12:20,416 --> 01:12:21,906
Take you men high
to the ridge.

1160
01:12:21,951 --> 01:12:22,975
Come on.

1161
01:12:36,766 --> 01:12:39,394
( water splashing )

1162
01:12:46,575 --> 01:12:49,135
( yells )

1163
01:12:55,851 --> 01:12:59,651
Armstrong, Durham, take your men
low to the back gates.

1164
01:12:59,689 --> 01:13:01,281
Dunnison and I

1165
01:13:01,323 --> 01:13:02,620
will take the front.

1166
01:13:02,658 --> 01:13:04,421
Now let's wake them np.

1167
01:13:05,828 --> 01:13:08,422
( all yelling )

1168
01:13:15,538 --> 01:13:18,632
Caballeros, the tunnels!
Come on!

1169
01:13:18,674 --> 01:13:20,266
Let's get in the tunnels!
Move!

1170
01:13:23,312 --> 01:13:26,475
Rangers!

1171
01:13:40,062 --> 01:13:42,087
( screaming )

1172
01:13:49,472 --> 01:13:51,440
Vamonos, apurate!

1173
01:13:55,511 --> 01:13:57,001
Charge!

1174
01:13:57,046 --> 01:13:59,674
( whooping and cheering )

1175
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:03,118
We're in, Rangers!

1176
01:14:03,152 --> 01:14:04,380
Oh, shit!

1177
01:14:05,821 --> 01:14:06,810
We're surronnded!

1178
01:14:06,856 --> 01:14:09,154
What the hell?? !

1179
01:14:09,191 --> 01:14:11,091
( screams )

1180
01:14:15,865 --> 01:14:17,526
We're surronnded in the back!

1181
01:14:34,683 --> 01:14:35,980
( grunting )

1182
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:56,538
( McNelly cocking gun )

1183
01:15:15,591 --> 01:15:17,650
( yelling )

1184
01:15:20,863 --> 01:15:22,626
( gun hammer clicks )

1185
01:15:29,638 --> 01:15:31,071
I'm out of cartridges!

1186
01:15:31,106 --> 01:15:33,040
Someone throw me
a cartridge!

1187
01:15:33,075 --> 01:15:34,906
( gunshots in distance )

1188
01:15:36,478 --> 01:15:38,912
( hammer clicks twice )

1189
01:15:38,948 --> 01:15:40,813
( grunts )

1190
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:42,943
( grunts )

1191
01:15:49,592 --> 01:15:51,492
Vamos, rapido!

1192
01:15:53,762 --> 01:15:56,663
Heard you were fast.

1193
01:15:58,133 --> 01:15:59,327
( yells )

1194
01:15:59,368 --> 01:16:01,529
Faster than that.

1195
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:02,628
( grunts )

1196
01:16:12,781 --> 01:16:14,612
( grunts )

1197
01:16:16,085 --> 01:16:17,882
( gun hammer cocks )

1198
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,979
This is only
gonna hurt

1199
01:16:20,022 --> 01:16:21,455
for a second.

1200
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:23,720
Maybe two.

1201
01:16:25,394 --> 01:16:27,385
( cocks hammer )

1202
01:16:27,429 --> 01:16:30,296
Kill him, Mr. Dunnison.

1203
01:16:30,332 --> 01:16:32,357
Kill him.

1204
01:16:32,401 --> 01:16:34,028
you kill me,
I'll kill him.

1205
01:16:47,116 --> 01:16:50,176
( gunshots )

1206
01:16:51,487 --> 01:16:52,977
( cocks gun )

1207
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:01,525
( gunshots )

1208
01:17:01,563 --> 01:17:04,293
( gunshots )

1209
01:17:08,671 --> 01:17:10,764
( grnnts )

1210
01:17:34,396 --> 01:17:36,956
Go!

1211
01:17:45,107 --> 01:17:47,166
Captain!

1212
01:17:47,209 --> 01:17:49,074
Captain, they want
to surrender.

1213
01:17:49,111 --> 01:17:50,476
They want to surrender.

1214
01:17:50,512 --> 01:17:52,173
No surrender,
right, Captain?

1215
01:17:52,214 --> 01:17:54,011
No prisoners, right?

1216
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:56,279
We take back our cattle.

1217
01:17:56,318 --> 01:17:58,752
We take them as prisoners.

1218
01:17:58,787 --> 01:18:00,812
We take them to trial.

1219
01:18:00,856 --> 01:18:01,914
but, Captain...

1220
01:18:01,957 --> 01:18:04,517
Those are the terms.

1221
01:18:07,997 --> 01:18:10,727
( cattle mooing )

1222
01:18:13,235 --> 01:18:15,226
( Rangers whistling )

1223
01:18:24,513 --> 01:18:26,606
( cattle lowing in distance )

1224
01:18:31,387 --> 01:18:33,480
( McNelly coughing inside )

1225
01:18:40,329 --> 01:18:41,660
He wants to see you boys.

1226
01:18:51,273 --> 01:18:54,504
( coughing )

1227
01:19:11,994 --> 01:19:14,792
When they remember us,
Rangers...

1228
01:19:18,167 --> 01:19:22,331
let them remember us not
as men of vengeance...

1229
01:19:22,371 --> 01:19:25,033
( coughing )

1230
01:19:28,844 --> 01:19:32,575
but... as men of law...

1231
01:19:32,614 --> 01:19:36,414
and justice.

1232
01:19:56,038 --> 01:19:59,337

1233
01:20:09,651 --> 01:20:11,551
( approaching footsteps )

1234
01:20:14,857 --> 01:20:16,791
( sighing )

1235
01:20:20,195 --> 01:20:23,858
Can't help but think
that they're watching.

1236
01:20:23,899 --> 01:20:27,892
Yeah...
I bet they're up there

1237
01:20:27,936 --> 01:20:32,396
riding like
the old days.

1238
01:20:32,441 --> 01:20:34,739
( horse whinnying )

1239
01:20:34,776 --> 01:20:36,266
Hey, Caroline!

1240
01:20:36,311 --> 01:20:37,539
( laughing )

1241
01:20:37,579 --> 01:20:38,944
Rounding up cattle.

1242
01:20:38,981 --> 01:20:40,642
We'll see you tonight!

1243
01:20:40,682 --> 01:20:44,243
He'll make
a good rancher.

1244
01:20:44,286 --> 01:20:46,186
And whatever else
you've got in mind

1245
01:20:46,221 --> 01:20:48,121
he might be all right
at that, too.

1246
01:20:50,692 --> 01:20:52,751
He's a good man, Mr. Dunnison.

1247
01:20:57,065 --> 01:20:59,533
Ride safe, Mr. Dunnison.

1248
01:21:06,475 --> 01:21:08,534
Rangers...

1249
01:21:12,548 --> 01:21:13,981
Ride out!

1250
01:21:17,052 --> 01:21:19,987
( horses whinnying )

1251
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:37,304
( hooves pounding )
