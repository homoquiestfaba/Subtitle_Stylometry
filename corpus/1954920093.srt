172
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:56,955
           Is it real?

173

       - I'm telling you.

189
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,145
  He didn't have a reflection.

190
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,247
         I didn't see it
        with my own eyes.

191
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:05,083

   Not you, Bon, another Bon.

195
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,035
       He's so mysterious.

196
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:28,473

         I have an idea.

199
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:40,318

       have garlic in it?

200
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,153
             - Yeah.

201
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,823
           - Perfect.

202
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:48,026
        I saw you weren't

203

  You should have this instead.

00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,434

206
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:57,402

208
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:02,874

         and the cheese

209
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,276
       and the yeast and--

210
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,278
   basically the whole pizza.

211
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:10,682
   - Yeah, but one little bite
           can't hurt.

212
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,151
    - Yeah, I mean, one bite
      can't hurt that much.

213
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,520
      I mean, how allergic
        can I really be?

214
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,255
            - Mm-hmm.

215
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,101

216
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,269
             Thanks.

217

          - What, Bon?

219
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,723
   - The poster, I don't like.

220
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:55,126
           - Uh, yeah,
     I don't like it either.

221
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,961
    - Well, I guess you guys
  don't need me here for this.

222
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,596
    I'm just gonna head out.

223

226
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,604
 We can talk about this, right?

227
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,139
 We can talk about this, please.

228
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,308

         to the garlic?

229
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,276
        - Everybody saw!

230
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,513
          What happened
      to Bon and the guys?

231
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,317
             Oh, no!

232
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,073
          - Oh my gosh.

233
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,509
    - O-M-G, he's sparkling.

234
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,779
    Pics or it didn't happen.

235
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,450
 - You have to send that to me.

236
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:59,257
          - Oh my gosh.

237
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,125
             - Wow.

238
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:12,870
 - DAVIS'S THOUGHTS: Oh, please.

239
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,339
          Kill me now.

240
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,040
         - Come with me.

241
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,714
 - DAVIS'S THOUGHTS: Looks like
     I'm gonna get my wish.

242
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,082
  She does plan on killing me.

243
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,084
     Probably leave my body
          in the woods.

244
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,886
          - Do you feel
 like you can be honest with me?

245
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,989
          - Uh...sure.

246
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,058
          - You're pale
    and you dress strangely.

247
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,927
      - Oh, you're starting
        with the honesty.

248
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,429
     - Tell me what you are.

249
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,365
       - What do you mean?

250
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,166
        - You're awkward.

251
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,836
  You really don't say anything
          interesting.

252
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:48,873
       - Oh, you should be
     a motivational speaker.

253
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:52,477
       - But I find myself
          drawn to you.

254
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:55,813
        - What was that?

255
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,148
  - You don't have a reflection
         in the mirror.

256
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,282
   You can't eat normal food.

257
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,618
         And you sparkle
       in direct sunlight.

258
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,253
          - I sparkle?

259
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,693
         I'm sparkling.

260
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:09,594
            - Say it.

261
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,495
           - Say what?

262
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:11,763
     - I know what you are.

263
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:12,630
            - You do?

264
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:13,765
          - Yes, I do.

265
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,067
        Say it out loud.

266
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:20,271

267
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,240
         No reflection.

268
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:27,211
 Uh, sparkling...like a vampire.

269
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:27,812
              - Uh!

270
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,447
           It's true?

271
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:35,787
             - Sure.

272
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,322
    Please promise to meet me
        by the first tree

273
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,625
     at the school entrance
        at 8:30 tomorrow.

274
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,526
             - Okay.

275
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,301
Oh, boy.

276
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,702
            I'm dead.

277
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:17,261
        You look so cool.

278
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:19,864
            - Thanks.

279
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,199
         - Let's go in.

280
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,434
        - We just walk in
   like in front of everyone?

281
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:24,569
            - Mm-hmm.

282
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,170
            Come on.

283
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,016
     - CAITLYN: Oh, hi, Bon.

284
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,985
         - BON: No way.

285
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,635
          - Is it true?

286
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,270
          - Is it true?

287
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,544
       What do you think?

288
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,885
        - This is totally
     the most amazing thing

289
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,154
  to ever happen at this cool.

290
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:21,425
      It's true, Davis Pell
    is a really, actually...

291
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,161
           a vampire.

292
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,337
             - Psst.

293
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,843
 Does this happen to you a lot?

294
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,111
    Do you go to new schools
        and people think

295
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:43,014
 you're a supernatural creature?

296
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:47,285
   Oh, were you Rocky Raccoon
      at your last school?

297
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:51,289
     - What makes you think
    I'm not really a vampire?

298
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,292
    - You act like you're 14,
            not 400.

299
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,461
   You go out during the day,
 which pretty much goes against

300
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,864
      the most basic tenant
        of vampire lure.

301
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:03,201
  And you are in no way suave.

302
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,703
            Oh, yeah,
    and vampires aren't real.

303
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:23,387
          Don't worry,
 I'm not going to say anything.

304
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:24,589
           - Why not?

305
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,658
     - Because you're making
   everybody look like idiots.

306
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,127
      I kind of love that.

307
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,396
        But some advice.

308
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,898
          You're going
  to have to step up your game

309
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,400

   you're terrible at accents.

333

 I'm not the one with an accent.

337
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:39,256
       The modern vampire
   is more of a cross between

00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,926
       a constipated model
  and a freshman poetry major.

339

354
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,231
  So what else is there to know
         about vampires?

355
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,599
           Like I know
      all the regular stuff

356
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,236
 like wooden stakes and sunlight
       and all that stuff.

         But what else?

358
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,507
   - There's a couple things.

359
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:33,544
     For instance, vampires
    are terrified of rabbits.

360
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:36,347
        They're incapable
  of singing "Happy Birthday."

361
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,582
         Oh, and this is
        an important one.

362
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:41,419
      If you beat a vampire
      in a staring contest,

363
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,654
   it renders them powerless.

364
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,756
      - A staring contest?
            - Mm-hmm.

365
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,224
            - Really?
            - Mm-hmm.

366
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:48,492
     - I don't believe you.

367

       have to believe me.

369
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:07,645
             - Doh!

370
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:08,245
              Okay!

   which technically makes me
   a third degree black belt.

463
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:02,072
        And I've defeated
      the game Castlevania,

464
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:07,544
    And I have seen the movie
     "Van Helsing" 47 times!

465
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:09,246
     And I hated that movie.

466
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:10,848
    - That--that's all great,

467
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,649
 but how is it going to help you
          get this guy?

468
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,754
         Mark my words.

469
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:19,423
 I will hunt this creature down
    to the ends of the world.

470
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,825
  There is nowhere he can hide.

471
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:25,362
          - Finding him
       won't be a problem.

472
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:26,930
          - Excellent.

473
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,840
       - Which one is he?

474
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:40,244
       - He's right there.

475
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:42,446
          - Excellent.

476
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,014
     - So, what's your plan?

477
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,316
        - This container
      is filled with water

478
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:49,787
      caught from the base
  of the Carpathian Mountains.

479
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,890
       It is renowned for
 its vampire-killing properties.

480
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:56,593
     When I spill it on him,
    it's going to be poof...

481
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:58,629
      goodbye, vampire boy!

482
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:03,167
      - Sssh, sssh, sh, sh.

483
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,768
              Sssh.

484
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:12,209
             Hello!

485
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,213
        - Can I help you?

486
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,014
             - Yeah.

487
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,883
 I am the water delivery person.

488
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:23,420
          And I'm here
      to deliver the water.

489
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:24,555
    - TEACHER: No water here.

490
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,558
        You probably want
      the teacher's lounge.

491
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:32,963
    - Or perhaps--or perhaps
       it was right here!

492
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:37,467
              - Ah!

493
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:38,869
         Evil creature!

494
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:47,644
    Drink this up you nasty,
    smelly thing from beyond!

495
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:52,983
terror.

496
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:03,126
              Yeah.

497
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,400
              - Mm.

498
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:11,768
 I guess we're gonna need a mop.

499
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,707
           - Hey, Vi.

500
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:20,177
       - So, this is what
      your lair looks like.

501
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,447
   I expected more candelabras
       and flowy curtains.

502
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,249
      - Ha, ha, very funny.

503
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:31,655
      - So...how do I look?

504
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:35,225
   - Not to feed your already
      rapidly growing ego,

505
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:38,629
   but you do look relatively
      presentable tonight.

506
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,364
- You're so sweet.

507
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:41,231
             - Mmm.

508
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:48,605
        So...what's with
       all the telescopes?

509
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:52,442
    - They're kaleidoscopes.

510
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,378
 - Why do you have all of them?

511
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:57,881
 - Oh, well, my mom gets me one
       every time we move.

512
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:00,450
    - Wow, you do move a lot.

513
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:06,723
 Yeah, I know it's weird, but it
    makes my mom happy, so...

514
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:12,396
          and actually,
  I--I kind of like them, too.

515
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,000
       They're pretty much
  the only things I really have

516
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,902
       from all the places
        that I've lived.

517
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,679
         - I don't think
      they're weird at all.

518
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,080
          I like them.

519
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:33,317

            - Thanks.

521
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:41,992
             - So...

522
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,731
 You got your dancing shoes on?

523
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:51,401

         about that one.

524
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:53,737

         Get over here.

526
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,073
          - What? Why?

527
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:59,076
    - I'm going to teach you
       how to slow dance.

528
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:02,646

00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,407
              - No.

618
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:41,010
No, I mean, yes, of course I do.

619
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:41,878
        It's just that--

620
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:42,879
        - No, no, no, no.

621
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,080
        I'm too excited.

622
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:45,415
  I have to go tell the girls.

623
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,885
Come over to my house on Friday,
  and we'll go over everything,

624
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:51,588
              okay?

625
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:52,389
             - Yeah.

626
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,690
          Okay, great.

627
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,107
   - GIRL: Do you really think
         that Caitlyn's

628
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,542
  going to go through with it?

629
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:13,710
       - Why wouldn't she?

630
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:14,711
          Wouldn't you?

631
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:19,382
      It's like the coolest
   thing to happen to anyone.

632
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:23,086
  - I can't believe Davis Pell
 is going to turn Caitlyn Crisp

633
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:25,221
         into a vampire.

634
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,090
         I'm so jealous.

635
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:35,265
 - Caitlyn is telling everybody
  that you're going to turn her

636
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:36,933
    into a vampire on Friday.

637
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:38,168
             - What?

638
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,836
     Oh, come on, she can't
     actually believe that.

639
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,672
   - Uh, you're talking about
 the girl that already believes

640
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,607
   you're a real-life vampire.

641
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:47,644
       She's expecting you
     to bite her on the neck

642
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,746
  and turn her into a vampire.

643
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:50,914
    You can't let this go on.

644
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:51,948
          It's too far.

645
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:53,082
     - I tried to tell her.

646
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:56,186
        - But you didn't.

647
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,354
 - I thought we were having fun.

648
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:02,892
  - Davis, you're the only one
    who's having fun anymore.

649
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:04,594
        - Oh, I see now.

650
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:05,895
         You're jealous.

651
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,631
      You think I'm jealous
           of Caitlyn?

652
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:09,732
              - No.

653
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:12,335
  I think you're jealous of me
       for being popular.

654
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:16,105
    Why would you be jealous
           of Caitlyn?

655
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,208
          - No reason.

656
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,243
        No reason at all.

657
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:22,412
 Have a great time Friday night.

658
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,558
       - DAVIS'S THOUGHTS:
        Okay, here we go.

659
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,228
   - DAVIS'S THOUGHTS: I don't
  know what I'm worrying about.

660
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,863
  I mean, she likes me, right?

661
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,431
       I can just confess,

662
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:43,466
         and we can put
     all of this behind us.

663
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,340
          Hey, Caitlyn.

664
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,643
       I've got something
       to confess to you.

665
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:57,313
    I'm not really a vampire.

666
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:58,748
          - Oh, Davis.

667
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,517
    I don't care about that.

668
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,485
       I like you for you.

669
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:04,120
          Now kiss me.

670
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:13,429
  - DAVIS'S THOUGHTS: Come on,
    Davis, hold it together.

671
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,165
    Just tell her the truth,
  and everything will be fine.

672
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,001
 Besides, she can't really think

673
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,636
      I'm going to turn her
         into a vampire.

674
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:26,109
             Uh-oh.

675
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:38,922
          It looks like
  you've got a nice place here.

676
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,757
           If I could
     actually see anything.

677
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:42,458
             - Come.

678
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,327
           - Caitlyn,
   there's--there's something

679
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:46,563
 I've been meaning to tell you.

680
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,721
           - Bite me.

681
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:14,357
      - Uh, well...you see,

682
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,192
        there's something
 that I really need to tell you.

683
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:18,895
  - Ssh, don't spoil the moment
       with your talking.

684
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:20,363
           Just do it.

685
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:24,500
             - Okay.

686
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:36,746
      Ugh, Caitlyn, there's
  a whole bunch of people here.

687
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:39,882
            - Mm-hmm.

688
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:41,551
     Better not disappoint.

689
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:51,961
        - I have to pee.

690
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:20,256
            - Ready?

691
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:22,659
            - Mm-mm.

692
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:38,141
       - How does it feel?

693
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:40,943
       - It doesn't really
       feel like anything.

694
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:43,079
        - Uh, that's how
     it's supposed to feel.

695
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,380
    That means it's working.

696
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:47,216
    That means it's working!

697
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:50,053

         even bite her.

698
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:52,021
      - He can't turn her.

699
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:53,790
          - May--maybe
      it just didn't take.

700
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:54,557
         I'll try again.

701

        Let me try again.

702
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:07,637

           I knew it.

704
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:10,840

705
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:12,709

         It was a joke.

 We can talk about this, right?

713

     Can't you take a joke?

714
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:32,061

   wasn't a vampire after all.

    I know it's tough on you
            sometimes

727
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:29,418
       with all the moving

             Thanks.

       and it's beautiful.

       even more beautiful

       wanted to tell you

773
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:28,264
   that what I did was wrong,
    and I'm a complete goon.

774
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:33,002
        And...I'm sorry.

775
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:37,773
          - No, Davis,
      I'm sorry...for you.

776
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:40,042
      You're a sad person,
       and you should go.

777
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:46,849
             - Yeah.

778
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:54,590
  - CAITLYN: Get back to work.

779
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:56,292
    I'm gonna check my site.

780
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:57,460
Oh my gosh!

782

       I've gone national!

00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,233
     - Oh, I just lost one.

784
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:23,452
          - Psst, hey.

785
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:25,087
       - What do you want?

786
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,656
     Need more footage of me
       acting like a jerk?

787
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:30,359
 - No, I've got plenty of that.

788
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,861
  I want to give you something.

789
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:37,199
          - What is it?

790
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,300
          - Just watch.

791
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:40,403
   It'll help you, believe me.

792
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:42,338
    - Why are you helping me?

793
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:49,078
I too know what it's like to try
    to be someone you're not

794
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,913
    for a woman's affections.

795
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:53,682
           - For Rita?

796
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:56,385
          - I like her,
    but I hate video cameras.

797
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,273
             - Cut.

798
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:19,208
     - BOY: Yeah, I got it.

799
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:21,677

     I'm not doing it again.

         the ugly truth.

801

         And no daydream
     could ever cover it up.

802
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:30,586
    What I saw in that video
        was so shocking,

803
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:33,289
        so mind blowing,
        so life altering,

804
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:36,692
 if I ever hope to show my face
      at that school again,

805
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:39,628
     I had to show everyone
      what I had just seen.

806
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:42,498
    I had to fix everything.

807

   You know, I just can't stop
 thinking about all these idiots

       you had it in you.

  - Of course all the students
       at school are sheep

878

      who will do anything
          I say anyway.

         The great thing

894
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:05,954
        about high school
  being a popularity contest--

895
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:07,890
          the rules are
     written by the winners.

896
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:09,425
    That's not what I meant.

897
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:13,328
          Oh, stop it!

898
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,031
              Agh!

899
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:27,810
 - I don't know how he did this.

900
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:30,946
 But you guys know I would never
   say anything bad about you.

901
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:35,184
     You're all my friends,
        and I adore you.

902
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:54,470
          - Hey, guys.

903
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:55,170
              Guys!

904
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:55,804
             Listen!

905
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:57,272
          Hey, listen!

906
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:06,381
  - This is high school, okay?

907
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:10,586
       No one really knows
        who they are yet.

908
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:14,423
       And we're all still
  trying to figure things out.

909
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:19,461
    I mean, you guys hated me
      like two minutes ago.

910
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:21,897
     And I don't blame you.

911
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,166
       Because I pretended
    to be something I wasn't

912
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:30,405
   so that you would like me,
        and I'm so sorry.

913
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:33,208
  But take a look at yourselves
          for a second.

914
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:38,247
  Is it any different for you?

915
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:44,052
I mean, Caitlyn Crisp is no more
   Miss Perfect than I am a--

916
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:47,489
         - Bloodsucker!

917
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:52,060
         - Look, that's
     our water delivery guy.

918
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:53,028
         - Who are you?

919
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:54,963
    - I am your arch nemesis.

920
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:57,032
             - Okay.

921
00:58:57,133 --> 00:59:00,002
    - I'm Baron Von Awesome,
        a vampire hunter.

922
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:02,037
       - Dude, that's, uh,
        Stewart's uncle.

923
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:03,572
         He still thinks
        you're a vampire.

924
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:04,840
      He wants to kill you.

925
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:06,575
             - What?

926
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:08,677
        I think it's been
     pretty well established

927
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:11,847
 that I'm not an actual vampire.

928
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:13,715
          I was getting
    way meaningful down here.

929
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:18,620
  It is not wise to ignore me,
            creature.

930
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:22,524
       Especially when...

931
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:25,661
     I have your girlfriend.

932
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:26,828
              - Vi!

933
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:30,432
   - Where does that door go?

934
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:32,134
         - Uh, the roof.

936
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,851
 - Come, demon, face your fate!

937
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:51,153
  - What are you talking about?

938
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,921
         There's no way
      I could get up there.

939
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:55,257
    - Use your dragon wings.

940
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:57,225
  - This whole not really being
         a vampire thing

941
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:59,194
  just isn't sticking with you,
             is it?

942
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:01,129
 - Uh, enough of your treachery,
          bloodsucker.

943
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:05,434
        I am coming down.

944
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,877
         - Bloodsucker!

945
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:19,348
          - I told you,
       I'm not a vampire!

               Ah!

949
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:33,295
  With such speed and agility,

950
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:36,665
        how can you claim
      to not be a vampire?

951
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:49,444
          - You got me.

952
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:53,415
      - I'm the real deal,
     and I'm real dangerous.

953
01:00:53,516 --> 01:00:56,952
  And right now, I'm real mad.

954
01:00:57,053 --> 01:01:00,656
        So I'd advise you
      not to challenge me.

955

          Give up now.

956
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:04,726
         - Arm yourself!

957
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:08,797
             - Okay.

958
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:21,743

              Uh...

962
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:41,229
   this is pointless, slayer.

963
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:43,165
          You know that
      there's only one way

964

 to render a vampire powerless.

965
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:47,969
          - Of course.

966
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:50,505
       A staring contest.

967
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:52,474
           - Exactly.

968
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:54,276
  And I accept your challenge.

969
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:03,885

971
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,261
            - Three!

972
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:03,612
  - You fought bravely, human.

973
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:11,286
            - I see.

974
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:15,357
        There's humanity,
       even in the undead.

     I will spare your life.

976

     I will spare his life!

977
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:29,538
          - Uh, thanks.

978
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,672
               Vi!

979

     going to untie me now?

987
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:14,482
         - Well, maybe.

988
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:16,585
But I'm thinking you're probably
   blaming me for all of this,

989
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,320
       and that you might
        actually hit me.

990
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:19,688
         - That's true.

991
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,926
 - But I might also be grateful
        that you saved me

992
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:26,995
     and give you that kiss
    you've been looking for.

993
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:33,568
 - You don't need arms for that.

    You're not even my type.

1001

1002
