1
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,671
Hey, Layla.

2
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,912
Have you been a good girl?

3
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:51,317
You're just hungry.

4
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,347
Come on, girl.

5
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,049
Yeah, me too.

6
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,838
Come on, Audrey, you can do this.

7
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,174
<i>The patients are beginning to speak
of a presence in the clinic.</i>

8
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,041
<i>Something they can feel.</i>

9
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,344
<i>Something I can feel.</i>

10
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:37,114
<i>Something I don't dare admit
I've felt before.</i>

11
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,859
<i>While I continue to explain away
the Boogeyman's existence...</i>

12
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:47,260
<i>...as nothing but the darkness
within ourselves...</i>

13
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,196
<i>...I'm left to wonder...</i>

14
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,235
<i>...does that make him anything less
than real?</i>

15
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:57,394
Layla, no.

16
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,428
It's time for bed.

17
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,965
Layla?

18
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,501
Layla, are you okay?

19
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,045
What's wrong, girl?

20
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,445
Did you hurt yourself?

21
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,863
And we're back.

22
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,439
<i>You're listening to Headspace
on WZXB...</i>

23
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,075
...Wolfbridge University radio.

24
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:54,804
I'm Sarah Morris and as always,
I'm here with Dr. Roger Kane...

25
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,448
...psychiatrist and head of
Wolfbridge's Psychology Department.

26
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,909
And we've got Liam on the line.

27
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,849
Liam, how can we help you?

28
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,546
<i>Yeah, this is a question for Sarah.</i>

29
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:07,351
Fire away, Liam.

30
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,553
<i>I listen to your show every night.
You have a really sexy voice.</i>

31
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,856
<i>Really.</i>

32
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,657
What exactly is your question?

33
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:18,564
<i>So, what do you say, Sarah?
Can I take you out sometime?</i>

34
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:21,203
Sorry, Liam, my boyfriend
is understanding,

35
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,272
but not that understanding.

36
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,570
<i>So I guess a blowjob's completely out
of the question?</i>

37
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,470
Not necessarily.

38
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,112
Just bend down as far as you can,
open up wide...

39
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:33,683
...and give it your best shot.

40
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,254
Our next call is from Eric.
Eric, how are you tonight?

41
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,983
<i>Okay, I guess.</i>

42
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,025
<i>Actually, not so good.</i>

43
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,197
<i>My girlfriend broke up
with me last week...</i>

44
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,866
<i>...and I've been having a hard time
dealing with it.</i>

45
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,167
Sounds like you really cared
about her.

46
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:51,893
<i>Yeah, I still do.</i>

47
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,537
<i>I think it was all my fault.</i>

48
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,432
<i>Well, I'm a freshman
and I haven't made that many friends.</i>

49
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,077
<i>I guess I just need
someone to talk to.</i>

50
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,214
Well, that's why we're here, Eric.
Fire away.

51
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,363
Hey, you still here?

52
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,999
Hi. Just putting
the finishing touches...

53
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,431
...on my ultimate breakup CD.

54
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,468
You know,
one of the cry-in-your-beer...

55
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,402
...women-are-nothing-but-cray
manipulative-bitches variety.

56
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:30,769
For that last caller?

57
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:34,136
I had Brandon get his info
before he hung up.

58
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,009
- Sarah...
- I know. I just...

59
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:38,547
He seemed so sad.

60
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:42,077
You know, he was blaming himself
for everything he's going through...

61
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,988
...and I knew what that feels like.

62
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:46,853
I'm proud of you.

63
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,754
What you've overcome
this past year...

64
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:52,328
It's gonna make you
a great psychiatrist one day.

65
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:54,926
I don't need to explain...

66
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:58,160
...why a psychiatrist should never
hand-deliver a sappy mix CD...

67
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,135
...to a broken-hearted
patient's bedroom, do I?

68
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,400
It's a good thing
I'm not a psychiatrist yet.

69
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,443
I'm serious.
Never underestimate the influence...

70
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,672
...your words
and actions have on others.

71
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,540
- Okay.
- See you.

72
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,219
Bye.

73
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,670
Thank you very much.

74
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,942
This is more than a spoonful.
This is like a Mama Jug, huh, right?

75
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:51,248
- Well, hello sweet cheeks.
- Don't touch my tits.

76
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,425
That's the property
of Alpha Sigma Theta.

77
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,150
Did you see that guy?

78
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,593
I'm telling you, guys, I fucking aced
my poetry final this morning.

79
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,564
- Poetry? Seriously?
- Yeah, man.

80
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,567
My professor says
I'm the next rock poet in the making.

81
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,967
My very own Jim Morrison.

82
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,472
Who?

83
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,274
What do you got there, Lukas?

84
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,712
It looks like... I don't know.
Grilled shit on a bun?

85
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,980
People actually get paid
to make this shit.

86
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,389
- Should have went to culinary school.
- You're killing in bong hits and games.

87
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,185
You might as well stick to that.

88
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,425
Did you talk to your dad
about winter break yet?

89
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:38,036
Yeah, I told him I was going home
with you and he's fine with it.

90
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:41,172
Really? That is so awesome.
My family's gonna love you so much.

91
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,238
So has anyone heard from Audrey?

92
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,448
I left a message on her cell,
I just haven't heard back yet.

93
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,710
Wow, the murders are all over
the news. It's...

94
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,353
- I didn't realie her dad was a big deal.
- He's huge.

95
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:59,524
He's been published
in every major Psych journal.

96
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,023
Maybe I should try her cell again.

97
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:05,928
Maybe you should give her some time.
She may not wanna talk about it yet.

98
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,234
Yeah, I know.
I'm just worried about her.

99
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,629
Jeremy, Jeremy,
little bit of vitamin C?

100
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,773
That's my tiggity.

101
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,635
I look so stupid without the one.

102
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,274
All right, well, ta-ta.

103
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,541
- Later, Ben.
- Did you see him?

104
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,561
I'm never taking a shower again.

105
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,732
- You showered in your bikini?
- Yeah.

106
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,959
Some perv fraternity is making
their pledges install webcams...

107
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,831
...in the girls' showers.

108
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,335
- Yeah.
- Oh, come on.

109
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,599
- I hear that story twice a semester.
- No.

110
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:53,711
A girl in my theater class told me
that it happened to...

111
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:57,077
It happened to, like, one of her friends
in another dorm.

112
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,411
Hearsay. There's no way that
that's true.

113
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,484
Well, I'm not taking any chances.

114
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:05,316
I'm not ending up on the Internet
like last time.

115
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,667
Your dad left another message.

116
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:21,762
Yeah, I got it.

117
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,611
He thinks you're coming home
for the holidays.

118
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:31,442
I'll call him. Just as soon
as this term paper is out of the way.

119
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,710
- How's it coming?
- Oh, so incredibly slow.

120
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,388
- Yeah?
- Yeah, at this rate, I'll be up all night.

121
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,887
Oh, okay.

122
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,355
Well, in that case...

123
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,861
...I am going to Jeremy's room.

124
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,529
- I will see you in the morning.
- Oh, have some sex for me.

125
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,797
Oh, you know I will. Oh, yeah.

126
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:57,635
That's so unfair. Bye.

127
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,578
Lindsay?

128
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,385
Audrey?

129
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,226
What's going on?

130
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,431
Oh, my God, are you okay?

131
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,491
Hey.

132
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,604
He's trying to kill me.

133
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,274
Who's trying to kill you?

134
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,937
The Boogeyman.

135
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:12,448
He killed my dad
and now he's trying to kill me too.

136
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:16,250
I'm sorry, Sarah.
I didn't know where else to go.

137
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:19,720
Audrey,
the Boogeyman didn't kill your dad.

138
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,649
He did.

139
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,957
I've seen him.

140
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,058
He's everywhere.

141
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,693
I thought I got away...

142
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,392
...but he keeps following me.

143
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,094
Sarah...

144
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,205
...I don't wanna die.

145
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,633
You're not gonna die.

146
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,212
Come here.

147
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:47,574
Hey...

148
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,385
...I'm gonna help you through this,
I promise.

149
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,324
You're gonna sleep here tonight,
okay?

150
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,172
It doesn't matter where I sleep.

151
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,271
He'll still find me.

152
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,553
Where are you going?

153
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,362
I'm just going to get some water,
okay?

154
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,126
Lt'll just take a minute.

155
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,032
Just try and go back to sleep.

156
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,728
I'll be right back.

157
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,781
Sarah?

158
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,061
Sarah?

159
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,267
Are you in here?

160
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,930
Help! Somebody open the door!

161
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,037
Open this door!

162
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,589
Audrey, what's wrong?

163
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:59,002
We have to go. Now.

164
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,865
He's in here.

165
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:05,066
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
There's nobody in here. Look.

166
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,414
Look, everything is gonna be okay.

167
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,439
Stop saying that, Sarah.

168
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,541
Everything is not gonna be okay.

169
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,015
Wait. Audrey.

170
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,357
Audrey, wait. Audrey.

171
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,549
He tried to get me.

172
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,558
Audrey...

173
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,293
Audrey, what happened?

174
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,660
Nothing.

175
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,699
Just go away.

176
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:35,305
Oh, please open the door
and talk to me.

177
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,604
Audrey?

178
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,430
Ben. Hey, is David here?

179
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,798
Hey, morning.

180
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,176
- So you finally cut his tongue out?
- Yeah.

181
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,040
Hell week. He can't talk to anyone
but his pledge brothers.

182
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:20,878
Oh, so the Greek system
truly does provide community service.

183
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:24,113
Bye.

184
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,327
- You look stressed.
- Audrey's back.

185
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:34,654
She thinks the Boogeyman
killed her dad.

186
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:38,129
- What?
- She's convinced he wants to kill her.

187
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,237
Will you check in on her
and make sure she's okay?

188
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:43,306
- I've got finals and the radio show.
- Oh, yeah, no, of course.

189
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,942
Thanks. I left a note for Lindsay.
Gotta go, I'm late.

190
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,236
Well, hey...

191
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,435
...are you okay?

192
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:50,772
Fine.

193
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,180
I promise.

194
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,528
And we're ready for our next caller.

195
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,724
Hi, you're on with Sarah
and Dr. Kane.

196
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,562
Caller, do you have a question?

197
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:16,797
Hi.

198
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,643
I'm being stalked.

199
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,511
<i>- It's Audrey.
- He won't leave me alone.</i>

200
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:30,620
I don't know what else to do.
He just follows me everywhere I go.

201
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,689
<i>Is he a friend, a boyfriend?</i>

202
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,991
I'm afraid we need to know
about your situation fully...

203
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:39,857
...in order to help you.

204
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,492
<i>You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.</i>

205
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,159
Why wouldn't we believe you?

206
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,706
Because you don't believe
in the Boogeyman.

207
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:51,607
What exactly do you mean
by the Boogeyman?

208
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,903
<i>He killed my dad...</i>

209
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,738
<i>...and those other people.</i>

210
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,713
I'm next.

211
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:08,017
Your father was one of those killed
at the Hillridge Clinic. I'm very sorry.

212
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:10,285
You must be experiencing
a great deal of pain.

213
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:14,128
Look, I know you don't believe me...

214
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,597
...but you will.

215
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,864
<i>Once I'm dead,
you'll know I was right.</i>

216
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,676
Call campus security and get
someone over to Hammonds Hall.

217
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:30,780
- Which room?
- 403. Her name is Audrey Allen.

218
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:33,280
Tell them she may be suicidal.

219
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:35,719
Sarah?

220
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:37,445
Sarah?

221
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,821
Hello?

222
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,288
Let's begin
by clarifying a few things.

223
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,135
<i>I understand your father
was killed...</i>

224
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,939
...by a man
who thought he was the Boogeyman.

225
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,910
No. No. Look, it was him.

226
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,111
I've tried to tell Sarah
but she won't listen.

227
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,018
I wouldn't believe me either
but it's the truth.

228
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,420
He's real.

229
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:17,192
I don't know what to do.

230
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,296
<i>You do realize the Boogeyman
is a legend?</i>

231
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:23,332
One that a very sick man used
as an excuse to hurt your father...

232
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,769
<i>...but a legend nonetheless.</i>

233
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,674
I found my dad's journal.

234
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,139
Look, he knew
the Boogeyman was real.

235
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,173
He knew he was gonna die.

236
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,282
Look, my dad was trying to help
those people before they all...

237
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,018
Hello, caller? Are you there?

238
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,128
Caller, are you there?

239
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,289
Hello?

240
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,398
Yeah.

241
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:35,830
I'm still here.

242
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:47,976
Hello, caller? Are you there?

243
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,175
Hello?

244
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,374
- What's going on?
- Someone's attacking Audrey.

245
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,517
- What?
- He's strangling her.

246
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:24,715
Jesus Christ.

247
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:34,090
Look, stay here. Stay here.
I'll call the police.

248
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,830
You sure you're gonna be okay?

249
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:18,033
All right, if we need anything else,
we'll call you.

250
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:32,479
Did you tell them what you saw?

251
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,894
Sarah, are you all right?
What happened?

252
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:44,999
I heard someone say that Audrey...

253
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:48,699
That she...

254
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,606
It's not true, is it?

255
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,079
She hung herself with a belt.

256
00:26:57,482 --> 00:26:58,744
Jee.

257
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:09,825
I think I'm getting sick again.

258
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,730
You feel fine to me.

259
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:21,702
No, I mean sick.
Sick the way I was last year.

260
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:28,710
I saw something in Audrey's room.

261
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:32,806
Something that wasn't really there.

262
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,416
What did you see?

263
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,690
If you don't wanna talk about it...

264
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:46,421
I saw someone standing over Audrey
like they had strangled her.

265
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:50,058
Who was it?

266
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,499
I don't know.

267
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,999
Sarah, you were in shock.

268
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,406
You witnessed one
of your best friends die tonight.

269
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:04,415
- It's probably...
- It's the same way my mom died.

270
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,543
What if it triggered something?

271
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:11,913
Something that I thought
wasn't there anymore?

272
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:13,988
No.

273
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,057
Sarah, listen to me.

274
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:20,027
After what you've been through
tonight...

275
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:25,291
...you could tell me you saw
a herd of pink elephants...

276
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:29,597
...in Audrey's room and I'd still think
you're the sanest girl I know.

277
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,299
Hello?

278
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,165
Hey.

279
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,932
Katie...

280
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:40,268
...hey.

281
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,343
Sorry,
I'm a little jumpy this morning.

282
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:43,775
I think we all are.

283
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,416
They asked me
to pack up Audrey's things.

284
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:50,281
- Already?
- Yeah, dorms close in 48 hours.

285
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,209
You two were pretty close, huh?

286
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:16,276
Yeah, we were.

287
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,580
Hey, where should I send her stuff?

288
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:23,618
The only contact listed was her dad.

289
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,557
He was all she had left.

290
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:42,672
Well, if there's anything of hers
that you'd like to keep...

291
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,768
Yeah, I think there is.

292
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,882
Thanks, Katie.

293
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,490
He ain't here.

294
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,929
- Where is he?
- Study group.

295
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:16,437
Sarah, by the way,
I'm really sorry about your friend.

296
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,269
A bunch of us were listening
to your show when she called in.

297
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:20,739
It was pretty freaky shit.

298
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:23,973
If there's anything I can do...

299
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,980
- Thanks. Tell David I stopped by.
- Yeah, sure.

300
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,835
I just can't stop thinking
about it, man.

301
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,901
She said someone strangled her.

302
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:50,268
Yeah, well, she was confused.

303
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:52,739
I'm just saying it's fucking freaky.

304
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,879
So am I helping you
pack your clothes...

305
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,708
...or am I simply packing them?

306
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:03,978
- Come in.
- Come in.

307
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:13,858
Careful. I got high
just walking down the hallway.

308
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:15,794
Everything okay?

309
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,297
I found something in Audrey's room.

310
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:19,800
Her dad's private journal.

311
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,567
Audrey was right about her dad.

312
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,867
He did believe
the Boogeyman was real.

313
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:28,739
He thought he was some kind
of physical manifestation of our fears.

314
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,142
Well, you said
he was a respected psychologist.

315
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,579
He never told anyone
what he wrote in the journal.

316
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,912
He was afraid
his patients would suffer for it.

317
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,781
More like his career.

318
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,651
His theory was that his patients
were susceptible to the Boogeyman...

319
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:43,292
...because they believed in him.

320
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:45,856
When you said
Audrey was strangled...

321
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:47,258
...who did you think...?

322
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,896
- I mean, you didn't...
- Let's change the subject, okay?

323
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:55,363
I just can't believe her nutjob dad was
in charge of helping those patients.

324
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,298
It's strange. Even though
his theories are illogical...

325
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:01,239
...he doesn't come off
like a raving lunatic in the journal.

326
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,937
He articulates his thoughts clearly.

327
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,172
Come on, Sarah.

328
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:08,784
I mean, if you believe a word
of what was in that journal...

329
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,080
...you're as cray as he was.

330
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,086
What?

331
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:16,890
That's not what I said.

332
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:18,289
Shit, sorry.

333
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,226
- I just meant that...
- Don't worry about it. It's cool.

334
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,597
You're almost all done packing.

335
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,736
I've just been procrastinating.
I should probably get started.

336
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,371
Right this second? Stick around.

337
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:29,870
That's okay.

338
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,042
I'll see you guys later.

339
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,279
Hello? Earth to Captain Oblivious?

340
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:41,316
- It came out the wrong way.
- Yeah.

341
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,962
<i>You have one new message.</i>

342
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:06,075
<i>Sarah, it's your dad.</i>

343
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:09,546
<i>You're probably busy with finals...</i>

344
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,684
<i>...but I was wondering when
you were planning on coming home.</i>

345
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:17,552
<i>I haven't seen you
since the funeral...</i>

346
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:19,713
<i>...and well, anyway...</i>

347
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,784
<i>...I can't wait to see you.</i>

348
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,859
<i>Bye, sweetie.</i>

349
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,865

00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:49,881
Damn it.

351
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,447
Hey, what happened?

352
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:57,392
I just had a fight
with the window shade.

353
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,324
You kick its ass?

354
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,827
No, the other way around.

355
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,499
That's all right.

356
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,167
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

357
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,393
I thought you guys were packing.

358
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,573
Yeah, I was packing.

359
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:12,435
Now we're taking a break...

360
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:15,043
...and you are coming
to grab a bite with us.

361
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,976
I'm not feeling so well
so I think I'm just gonna go to bed.

362
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:19,615
Bed?

363
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,409
There's no bed in finals week.

364
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,686
- I didn't get much sleep last night.
- Yeah, who did?

365
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:26,949
Hey, come on.

366
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,683
You know, it might do us some good
to get out of here.

367
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,727
You guys go ahead. Seriously.

368
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,656
- Come on.
- Okay.

369
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:36,856
See you later.

370
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,133
Okay, have fun.

371
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,436
Lighter, check.

372
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,534
Bong, check.

373
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:57,608
Ignite.

374
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:29,170
Oh, shit.

375
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,514
Shit.

376
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,784
Shit.

377
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:45,286
Oh, shit.

378
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:47,487
I gotta stop smoking.

379
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,004
I gotta stop smoking.
I gotta stop smoking.

380
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:56,703
I gotta go to rehab.

381
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,501
I gotta do something. I gotta stop.

382
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:50,010
Hello?

383
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,259
Lukas?

384
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,366
Lukas.

385
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,497
What the hell is going on?

386
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:18,871
Lukas, answer me.

387
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:21,839
What happened to you?

388
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,233
Sarah, hey.
Whoa, whoa, what happened?

389
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:22,928
We have to find Lukas. He's hurt.

390
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,903
Lukas? How did he get hurt?
I don't...

391
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:27,100
I saw him in the kitchen.
He was bleeding.

392
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:28,869
He had glass in his mouth.

393
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:31,707
Glass? Sarah, are you sure
there was glass in his mouth?

394
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:34,510
Yes, but everything was different.

395
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,881
- Different? How were things different?
- Hey, what are you guys doing?

396
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:40,886
- Have you seen Lukas?
- Lukas? No, we've been at dinner.

397
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:43,150
- Why? What's wrong?
- Can you help me find him?

398
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,023
- Can we look in your room?
- Sure. Come on.

399
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:52,736
He's not here.

400
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:54,905
He's probably just out
studying somewhere.

401
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:56,299
Yeah, or getting smashed.

402
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:58,099
Why are you so worried
about Lukas?

403
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:01,836
I saw him in the kitchen with blood
and glass pouring out of his mouth.

404
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,947
- Well, are you sure it was Lukas?
- Yes, I'm positive.

405
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:07,344
Well, I'll call his mobile.

406
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,519
Did he say anything?
Tell you what happened?

407
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,349
No, he tried to talk but he couldn't.
And then somebody grabbed me...

408
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:14,956
Wait. Who grabbed you?

409
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:16,558
Lukas...

410
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,991
...it's Jeremy. Look, man, give me
a ring when you get this, yeah?

411
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:22,392
- Voice mail.
- Sarah, who grabbed you?

412
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:27,068
It was the same person
I saw in Audrey's room last night.

413
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,738
You mean...

414
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,638
...the Boogeyman?

415
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:36,001
I know how it sounds. I do. But...

416
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:37,874
Sarah.

417
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:43,083
It sounds like you had
a horrible fucking nightmare.

418
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,256
I've had dreams like that before.
I mean, they're so real, they're freaky.

419
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,890
This was different.

420
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:50,253
Sarah,
you're probably just exhausted...

421
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:54,329
...and everything will seem clearer
to you in the morning.

422
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:05,402
Yeah, I don't know. Maybe.

423
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:07,570
Sarah, wait.

424
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,671
- Hey.
- Hey.

425
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:13,179
Yeah, I'm gonna stay
with her tonight.

426
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,284
Yeah, good idea.

427
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,420
- Let me know if you hear from Lukas.
- Yeah.

428
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:18,713
Okay.

429
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:20,184
Bye.

430
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,761
I can only come up
with one logical explanation.

431
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:33,225
- It's happening again.
- What do you mean?

432
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:36,465
Me seeing things that aren't there.

433
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:40,968
You know...

434
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:43,580
...maybe it wouldn't be
such a bad thing...

435
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:45,373
...if you went home for the holidays.

436
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:48,749
This has nothing to do
with where I spend the holidays.

437
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,250
Okay, look.

438
00:44:56,694 --> 00:45:01,358
Yeah, it's been
a fucking rough 24 hours...

439
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,167
...but that's all this means.

440
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:07,000
Two days from now,
you're gonna be away...

441
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,434
...from everything
that's happened here.

442
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,107
Relaxing.

443
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:12,832
I know.

444
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,243
Don't worry about this.

445
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,605
You're fine.

446
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:19,248
I know you are.

447
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,619
Fuck.

448
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,121
Jeremy.

449
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:34,590
Hello?

450
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,390
Is someone there?

451
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:19,465
Lukas? Is that you?

452
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:23,172
Hey, where are you going, man?
Lukas?

453
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,507
Lukas?

454
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,884
What the fuck?

455
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:36,882
Lukas, mate.

456
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:55,798
Shit.

457
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:14,413
What the fuck?

458
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:33,802
What the fuck?

459
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:35,911
Oh, my God.

460
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:41,507
Help!

461
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:43,880
Help!

462
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:07,241
That's the worst sound in the world.

463
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:24,120
Lindsay, where's your cell phone?

464
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,668
Hey, Jeremy never called.

465
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,537
Do you think that means
he didn't hear from Lukas?

466
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:44,744
Or it was late when he did.

467
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,795
Jeremy? Lukas?

468
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:00,854
<i>Hey, it's me. Leave a word, mate.</i>

469
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:40,553
Well, everyone deals with stress
in different ways.

470
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,790
Some people completely lose interest
in sex, while others...

471
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,297
<i>Not my boyfriend.</i>

472
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:49,165
<i>He says sex is the only way
he can relieve stress.</i>

473
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,097
If it's affecting your studies...

474
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:53,367
...you need to tell him
there are other ways...

475
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:55,875
<i>What if he doesn't understand?</i>

476
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:59,880
<i>Sarah,
what do you think I should do?</i>

477
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:03,543
<i>Hello?</i>

478
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:06,446
<i>Hello?</i>

479
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:09,792
Just be open and honest
with your boyfriend.

480
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:12,086
And if he disregards
your concerns...

481
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:15,264
...then there's a much larger problem
with your relationship.

482
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,365
<i>That's what I was afraid of.</i>

483
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:19,865
<i>Okay, well, thanks for the advice.</i>

484
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:23,004
That's what we're here for,
right, Sarah?

485
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,066
That's right.

486
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:30,042
Finals week is stressful so we're doing
extra shows this week to help you out.

487
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:34,246
Great. Thank you for listening.
We'll be right back.

488
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:36,180
Sorry.

489
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:38,855
It's okay. It's all right.

490
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:40,854
- Wanna take a breather?
- Yeah.

491
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:42,581
Come on. Let's take a break.

492
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:44,419
<i>- Yeah.
- They're around somewhere.</i>

493
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:46,459
Yeah, I know.

494
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,790
But, Linds,
will you just check in on them?

495
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,229
Make sure they're okay.
I'm just getting worried.

496
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:54,597
<i>- Yeah, of course I will.
- Thanks.</i>

497
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:57,170
I gotta go. I'll call you back.

498
00:52:58,642 --> 00:52:59,870
I'm sorry.

499
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:02,738
I know I've been distracted.

500
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:05,471
A couple of my friends are missing
and I've...

501
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,843
I've been seeing things again.

502
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:09,916
What kind of things?

503
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:14,182
The night Audrey died was
the first time I saw the Boogeyman.

504
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:16,188
- Sarah...
- I know what you're gonna say.

505
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:17,883
This is not about the Boogeyman.

506
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:20,858
Audrey dying the same way
my mom died, I know.

507
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:23,294
This is about your guilt.

508
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:25,657
It's always been about the guilt.

509
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:29,202
You blame yourself for not preventing
your mother's suicide.

510
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:31,499
You think I blame myself
for Audrey too?

511
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:35,173
A lot of those guilty feelings
came bubbling back up to the surface.

512
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:37,271
What do you think?

513
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,343
I wish I'd taken Audrey
more seriously.

514
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,178
By believing in the Boogeyman?

515
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,820
Validating her fear
by making it your own?

516
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:48,820
Sarah, you're not afraid
of the Boogeyman.

517
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:52,392
You're afraid of the guilt.
Of what it's capable of.

518
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:55,463
Guilt that you've never
completely come to terms with.

519
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:59,461
So I'm going cray
because I'm afraid of going cray?

520
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:03,127
- That's what you're saying?
- You're not cray.

521
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:06,674
Either I'm cray
or the Boogeyman is real.

522
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:09,344
And right now,
I don't know which one is worse.

523
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:10,638
They're the same fear.

524
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:13,248
Sarah, once you face it...

525
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,851
...you'll find that neither of those
things will bother you anymore.

526
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,128
This is ridiculous.

527
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:21,082
Oh, my God.

528
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:27,685
I don't believe in you.

529
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:29,591
You don't exist.

530
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:40,994
I don't believe in you.

531
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:42,899
You don't exist.

532
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,900
I don't believe in you.

533
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:49,568
You don't exist.

534
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:55,943
I don't believe in you.

535
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:57,913
You don't fucking exist.

536
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:14,736
Great.

537
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:18,039
You really are going cray.

538
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:16,497
Oh, my God.

539
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:40,043
Jeremy?

540
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:44,543
Help me. Help me, please.

541
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:47,779
- Help me.
- Tell me what to do.

542
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:52,060
Get me out.

543
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:57,164
I'm gonna go
and I'm gonna find some help.

544
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,732
I'm gonna get you out,
you hear me?

545
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:00,129
No, don't leave me.

546
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:04,797
No.

547
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,877
Sarah. Sarah. Are you okay?

548
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,742
Hey. Come here.
Come here. Come here, Sarah.

549
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:15,440
Are you okay? Come here.

550
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:16,676
My God, what happened?

551
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:22,123
How did...? How did I get...?

552
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:24,350
You were under your bed.
I heard you screaming.

553
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:26,586
Oh, Jesus, Sarah, you're bleeding.

554
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:30,758
- That's not my blood.
- What? Whose blood is it?

555
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:32,992
- That's Jeremy's blood.
- Jeremy? How did...?

556
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:34,464
That's where he grabbed me.

557
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:36,160
That means he's real.

558
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:37,862
David...

559
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,974
...that means
the Boogeyman is real.

560
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:42,610
No, no, come here.

561
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:44,136
Come here.

562
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:50,309
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

563
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:52,385
See, Sarah?

564
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,250
There's no blood.

565
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:56,448
It didn't actually happen.

566
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:03,397
No dead bodies.

567
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,768
But I saw them.

568
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:10,166
I recognied their faces.

569
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,773
They're the people
who live in this dorm.

570
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:14,307
Yeah, it was the Boogeyman.

571
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:18,173
I heard it on the radio.
That's why she killed herself.

572
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:19,908
Do you know what else is weird?

573
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,947
I heard that Jeremy and Lukas
are missing.

574
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:24,984
- Did you hear what they said?
- Yeah.

575
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:29,318
Listen, everyone on campus
listens to your radio show.

576
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:32,961
People are bound to start talking.
It doesn't mean a...

577
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:36,187
Are you okay?

578
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:39,562
It looked like someone
was up there watching me.

579
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:45,230
- I don't see anything.
- There was something up there.

580
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:56,375
- See? They're starting to believe.
- You don't know...

581
01:00:56,586 --> 01:00:59,453
Which is what happened
to the patients at the Hillridge Clinic.

582
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,886
- They started to believe...
- What happened at Hillridge...

583
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:05,288
...won't happen here because
everyone is leaving tomorrow.

584
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,963
The dorms close tomorrow
at noon, right?

585
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:11,759
Oh, my God, the suitcases
all over the hallway.

586
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:14,797
It's gonna happen tomorrow
when everyone's leaving.

587
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,471
Sarah.

588
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:19,468
I think...

589
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:24,809
...maybe you should just spend
winter break with your dad.

590
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:28,310
Are you serious?

591
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:30,308
Yeah.

592
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,686
He called earlier and he said
he hadn't talked to you in months.

593
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:36,655
Why'd you lie to me?

594
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:40,286
I'm sorry. I was gonna tell him.
I just...

595
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,098
You don't want me
to come home with you?

596
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,325
I just don't want you to use me
as an excuse.

597
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,561
I mean, you haven't been home...

598
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,163
...since your mom died.

599
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:55,276
Maybe it'd be good for you.

600
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:57,446
Good for me?
What does that mean?

601
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:00,114
It's disgusting.

602
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:02,648
Ben, what's up?

603
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,749
All right, let's go.

604
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:13,890
I'm just saying it's okay
if you're not completely over it...

605
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:17,328
...just as long as you're still trying
to deal with it.

606
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:30,104
Is that a blueprint
of the women's restroom?

607
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,715
It's true?
You're gonna put a webcam...

608
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,712
...in the women's restroom
for your fraternity?

609
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:35,975
That is so sketchy.

610
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:38,585
Yeah, well, if I don't,
I stay a pledge next semester.

611
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:41,256
Have you any idea
what I've been through?

612
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:44,949
The humiliation? There is no way
I'm going through that shit again.

613
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:47,493
Some guy was supposed to do it,
but he never came back.

614
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:49,995
Probably got caught, fucking idiot.

615
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:54,801
I will give you 50 bucks
to do it for me.

616
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:58,735
- I hope you're kidding.
- No. You can walk into the bathroom.

617
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:01,501
I have to crawl
through the fucking heating ducts.

618
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:03,507
I don't think that's a good idea.

619
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:05,874
Me either.
That's why you should do it for me.

620
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:09,415
- No, Ben, I'm serious. I saw...
- What?

621
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,216
I saw blood
coming out of those vents.

622
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:16,015
Blood.

623
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:21,759
Oh, man.

624
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:26,298
Is this about the Boogeyman?

625
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:29,494
Because that's what everyone
in the cafeteria was talking about.

626
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:31,605
See? That's what I'm talking about.

627
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,572
- Everyone's talking about it because...
- Because it's fucking creepy.

628
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:36,711
No, it's completely irrational.

629
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:48,988
- I'm just trying to help you, Sarah.
- I appreciate your help.

630
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:50,819
Where are you going?

631
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:53,552
Haven't you heard? I'm going cray.

632
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:57,255
I feel really shitty.

633
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:03,495
<i>The patients are beginning to speak
of a presence in the clinic.</i>

634
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:07,608
<i>Something they can feel.
Something I can feel.</i>

635
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:11,678
<i>Something I don't dare admit
I've felt before.</i>

636
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:15,917
<i>While I continue to explain away
the Boogeyman's existence...</i>

637
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:19,485
<i>...as nothing but the darkness
within ourselves...</i>

638
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,850
<i>...I'm left to wonder:</i>

639
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:25,719
<i>Does that make him
anything less than real?</i>

640
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:11,667
Come on, man, let's find those girls.

641
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:24,919
You missed
your Behavioral Genetics final.

642
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:26,712
Dr. Kane, I'm sorry.

643
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,721
I had something important
I had to take care of.

644
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:32,520
More important
than passing my class?

645
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:41,795
<i>"Sociology of Modern Oral Legends. "</i>

646
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:44,063
Thinking about
changing your major?

647
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:47,572
I found this article
in Dr. Allen's journal.

648
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,007
He was trying to find a way
to stop the Boogeyman.

649
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:51,778
We've talked about this.

650
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:54,506
The Boogeyman is not real.
He is a legend.

651
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:56,082
According to this article...

652
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:59,049
...a legend lives or dies
based on its social relevancy.

653
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:01,086
A legend is a fictional story, Sarah.

654
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,884
Not a living, breathing entity.
You do realie that?

655
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:09,597
Sarah, indulge me.

656
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:13,997
Why do we create legends,
from a psychological point of view?

657
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:16,501
We create legends as parables.

658
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:20,938
Stories to help us understand
the world we live in.

659
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:33,513
All right.

660
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:34,985
Okay.

661
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:39,958
This is the most fun I've had
in years.

662
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:42,931
So, what does that say
about the Boogeyman?

663
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:47,759
It says we're trying to define evil
by giving it a face and a name.

664
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:50,234
Yes. And as long as there is evil
in this world...

665
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:52,430
...the Boogeyman remains
socially relevant.

666
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:54,108
- That's all it's saying.
- No.

667
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,244
It's saying
that the legend survives...

668
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:59,778
...because the person
retelling the story believes it.

669
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:02,644
But you're taking that
completely out of context.

670
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,116
Don't you see?
The Hillridge Clinic murders...

671
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:06,618
...they make the legend real.

672
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:11,925
<i>It's as if the legend
has a life of its own.</i>

673
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:17,792
Oh, yeah.

674
01:07:20,936 --> 01:07:23,962
Oh, hello, baby.

675
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:25,800
Oh, what do you want?

676
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:28,442
Yeah, that's right.

677
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:35,775
Let me introduce you...

678
01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:39,315
...to my one-eyed friend.

679
01:07:43,426 --> 01:07:45,360
Did you hear anything?

680
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:56,869
Up there.
You guys, you guys, this is creepy.

681
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,371
What was that? What was that?

682
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:03,678
There was an incident last year.
A man named Tim Jensen...

683
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:05,676
...blamed his murders
on the Boogeyman.

684
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:09,612
- What does that have to do with this?
- Both stories are different variations...

685
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:10,808
...of the same legend.

686
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:13,181
Usually, when a person
retells the legend...

687
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:16,290
...they change it to fit society's needs.
But in this case...

688
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:18,653
Wait, wait, wait.
Listen to what you're saying.

689
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:22,697
- A legend cannot modify itself.
- This one can.

690
01:08:22,898 --> 01:08:25,389
To some people,
the Boogeyman is Tim Jensen.

691
01:08:25,734 --> 01:08:27,998
To other people, it's Henry Porter.

692
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:30,764
But it's the original legend
that gains its strength...

693
01:08:30,973 --> 01:08:33,168
...every time it's reborn.

694
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:37,410
So you missed my final...

695
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:41,811
...because you were trying to stop
a legend from perpetuating itself.

696
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:44,877
You understand
why that worries me?

697
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:46,749
I'm running out of time.

698
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:49,152
Wait a minute, Sarah.

699
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:50,848
Sarah?

700
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:00,728
What the...?

701
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:05,665
Blood.

702
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:27,019
Oh, fuck.

703
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:56,021
What are you saying?
Every time someone buys this crap...

704
01:09:56,225 --> 01:09:59,888
...the Boogeyman gets stronger?
- It keeps the legend alive.

705
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:01,619
It keeps him alive.

706
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:05,960
David, it's about to happen here.
In this dorm.

707
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:07,795
The legend is about to be reborn.

708
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:13,206
- What did I miss?
- Did you talk to Jeremy or Lukas?

709
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:15,001
No. And I've looked everywhere.

710
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:18,647
- See? It's happening.
- Well, Jeremy did have finals all day.

711
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:21,077
They probably went out
to celebrate after.

712
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:22,773
Without calling you?

713
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:25,385
I'm not saying
he won't be punished.

714
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:30,389
I just... I don't think he was killed
by some mythological creature.

715
01:10:30,593 --> 01:10:31,582
Come on, Lindsay.

716
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:34,657
What was the longest Jeremy's
ever gone without calling you?

717
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:36,023
An hour?

718
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:39,623
Sarah...

719
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:42,395
...you're my best friend
and I love you...

720
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:44,129
...but if you honestly think...

721
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,865
...that everyone in our dorm
is gonna die...

722
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:48,805
...why aren't you leaving?

723
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:50,842
Because I can't do that.

724
01:10:51,046 --> 01:10:54,607
I can't just walk away
and let everyone...

725
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:57,684
- I have to get them out of here.
- Sarah, this is ridiculous.

726
01:10:57,886 --> 01:11:01,447
You're not going to convince an
entire dorm full of people to just leave.

727
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:03,750
<i>This is DJ Def Jeff...</i>

728
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:08,555
<i>...and you're listening
to WZXB radio.</i>

729
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:11,491
I'll be with you all night long...

730
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,930
...keeping the energy alive...

731
01:11:14,136 --> 01:11:16,161
...so all those can stay awake.

732
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:19,135
<i>Listen to this.</i>

733
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:28,578
What the hell...?

734
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:32,185
Hi. You're not even supposed
to be here tonight.

735
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:34,015
What are you doing?

736
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,180
Attention.

737
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:39,691
All students living
in Hammonds Hall...

738
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:43,725
<i>...this is Sarah Morris
with an emergency announcement.</i>

739
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:45,661
Shit.

740
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:48,803
Campus security has issued
an emergency request...

741
01:11:49,004 --> 01:11:50,767
...for all students to evacuate...

742
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,134
<i>...Hammonds Hall immediately.</i>

743
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:55,867
<i>Take your belongings
and stay with a friend.</i>

744
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:58,603
<i>Anyone not in Hammonds Hall.</i>

745
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:06,616
<i>I repeat. This is an emergency
announcement...</i>

746
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:10,280
...for students of Hammonds Hall
to evacuate immediately.

747
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:12,790
Take your belongings with you.

748
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:22,765
Several students
are already missing.

749
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:26,771
- It's dangerous for anyone to remain...
- You're listening to WZXB Radio.

750
01:12:26,975 --> 01:12:31,309
Up next, DJ Def Jeff
and the smooth grooves.

751
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:35,676
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm calling campus security.

752
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:37,818
They haven't made
any announcement.

753
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:01,770
Sarah Morris?

754
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:05,174
- Are you Sarah Morris?
- Yes, but listen to me.

755
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:06,575
- I can explain.
- I'm sure.

756
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:09,478
Please. There is a journal in my room,
that will... David.

757
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:12,343
- Hey, back off.
- Just tell me where you're taking her.

758
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:14,613
Go back to your dorm,
she'll call you when she's done.

759
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:18,122
- Don't go back to the dorm. Promise.
- Get in the car.

760
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:20,022
Back off.

761
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:25,200
Please, David. David, don't go back.

762
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:29,135
David.

763
01:13:37,846 --> 01:13:41,111
Hey, David. Is Sarah with you?

764
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:43,011
<i>No, they took her
to the security office.</i>

765
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:46,086
Security office? Why?

766
01:13:46,288 --> 01:13:48,381
<i>- Long story.
- Is she okay?</i>

767
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:50,856
<i>Yeah, but they won't let me
see her.</i>

768
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:52,458
<i>Did you hear from Jeremy?</i>

769
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:56,859
No, I still haven't heard
from Jeremy or Lukas.

770
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:04,302
<i>- I'm starting to wonder if...
- What?</i>

771
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:09,137
Maybe Sarah was right.

772
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:12,172
Yeah, I'm packing up my stuff
and getting out of here.

773
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:15,980
<i>- Try not to worry.
- Okay. Well, just keep me posted.</i>

774
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:18,444
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

775
01:14:55,891 --> 01:14:57,358
Help!

776
01:14:58,293 --> 01:15:00,090
Somebody help me!

777
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:03,363
Help!

778
01:15:20,382 --> 01:15:21,713
Help!

779
01:15:32,628 --> 01:15:35,324
Help! Help!

780
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:39,933
Help! Help!

781
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:50,905
Oh, come on.
Is this totally necessary?

782
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:54,913
I mean, it's a little bit extreme keeping
her locked in a cell on her own.

783
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:58,553
She's claiming everyone in her dorm
is going to die.

784
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:00,551
Dr. Kane.

785
01:16:02,424 --> 01:16:03,789
All right.

786
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:10,659
- What are you doing here?
- Sarah.

787
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:13,926
You have half the student body
in a total panic for nothing.

788
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:15,603
My friends are dead.

789
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:18,532
I saw them.
There was blood all over the hallway.

790
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:20,367
- And then...
- Sarah.

791
01:16:23,045 --> 01:16:25,536
You're relapsing to the time
of your mother's death.

792
01:16:26,214 --> 01:16:27,977
You have to let go.

793
01:16:28,183 --> 01:16:31,380
- Sarah, it is not your fault.
- I know it's not my fault.

794
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,787
This has nothing to do
with how my mother died.

795
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:36,249
Please.

796
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:40,588
I just... I know something horrible
is gonna happen.

797
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:43,390
Why hasn't anyone else
seen this blood?

798
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:46,462
Because it is in your head.

799
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:37,816
<i>- Campus security.
- I just found some girl's body.</i>

800
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:40,250
<i>She's inside the...
God, there's blood everywhere.</i>

801
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:41,683
Hey, calm down.

802
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:44,222
Where are you calling from?

803
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:47,852
<i>I'm in the laundry room
in Hammonds Hall.</i>

804
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:49,223
Okay, stay where you are.

805
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:52,525
I'm gonna call the police and I'm
on my way over there right now.

806
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:57,669
A student's body's been found
in Hammonds Hall.

807
01:17:57,873 --> 01:18:00,103
I gotta go. Come on.

808
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:03,004
No, it's okay. I'll take care of her.

809
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:04,809
All right.

810
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,741
See? I was telling you the truth.

811
01:18:06,948 --> 01:18:08,882
- It's him.
- That's not what this means.

812
01:18:09,084 --> 01:18:12,019
You can't honestly believe
that this was a coincidence.

813
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:13,278
Please.

814
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:18,084
If we don't do something they're gonna
find more bodies in that dorm. Just...

815
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:20,693
You have to believe me.

816
01:18:27,102 --> 01:18:31,038
Oh, my God. You do believe me.

817
01:18:32,808 --> 01:18:35,402
That is not what you think it is.

818
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:37,707
No.

819
01:18:39,581 --> 01:18:42,778
Wait, Dr. Kane. Don't go in there.

820
01:18:48,623 --> 01:18:51,683
See?
Absolutely nothing to worry about.

821
01:18:53,628 --> 01:18:55,357
Dr. Kane.

822
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:01,864
Sarah, get the keys. Get the keys.

823
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:04,467
There. On the desk, Sarah.

824
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:08,341
Oh, my God.

825
01:19:14,216 --> 01:19:15,205
Okay.

826
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:17,642
Oh, God.

827
01:19:18,153 --> 01:19:20,951
- I don't know which one it is.
- Try them one at a time.

828
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:22,487
Hurry.

829
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,554
- Oh, my God.
- For God's sake, Sarah, hurry.

830
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,128
Oh, my God.

831
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:32,060
Kane!

832
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:42,637
No.

833
01:19:55,657 --> 01:19:57,557
I'm sorry.

834
01:19:57,959 --> 01:19:59,893
I didn't mean for you...

835
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:03,661
He used me.

836
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:16,104
<i>- Sarah.
- David.</i>

837
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:18,802
<i>David, I figured it out.
It's all my fault.</i>

838
01:20:19,014 --> 01:20:21,278
Sarah, slow down. Where are you?

839
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:24,712
He wanted me to see Audrey die.

840
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:27,388
He wanted me to tell people about it.
He used me.

841
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:30,649
<i>He used me to convince everyone
he was real.</i>

842
01:20:30,859 --> 01:20:32,349
Sarah, you were right.

843
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:34,825
You were right.
I'm so sorry I didn't believe you.

844
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:37,362
Tell me where to take the journal
and I'll be right there.

845
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:38,992
Wait, where are you?

846
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:41,101
<i>- I'm in your room.
- You're still in the dorm.</i>

847
01:20:41,303 --> 01:20:44,136
<i>David, you have to get out of there.
David.</i>

848
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:45,736
David.

849
01:20:47,475 --> 01:20:49,443
David, you have to get out
of the dorm now.

850
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:53,472
David. David. David...

851
01:21:11,099 --> 01:21:12,896
Go around back.

852
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:15,692
You heard him. Go around back.

853
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:22,299
I'm not kidding, there was someone
hiding under my bed.

854
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:24,569
I swear to God there was.

855
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:29,572
Oh, David.

856
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,810
David, what's wrong?

857
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:36,582
David, please talk to me.

858
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:40,454
David, come on, let's go.
Let's just get out of here.

859
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:43,922
You were right.

860
01:21:44,966 --> 01:21:47,093
The Boogeyman is real.

861
01:21:58,613 --> 01:21:59,602
No!

862
01:22:01,549 --> 01:22:03,176
- Sarah, help me.
- No!

863
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:06,183
- You son of a bitch!
- Please. Don't let go. Don't let go.

864
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:11,056
- No.
- No.

865
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,685
No!

866
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:19,263
No!

867
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:21,094
David.

868
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:23,833
Let him go.

869
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:35,549
No!

870
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:50,828
Oh, my God.

871
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:17,816
Sarah, what's going on?

872
01:23:29,404 --> 01:23:30,928
What the hell happened here?

873
01:23:33,141 --> 01:23:35,735
Sarah, tell them.
Tell them about the Boogeyman.

874
01:23:35,944 --> 01:23:37,639
He's real, isn't he?

875
01:23:43,785 --> 01:23:44,774
Oh, my.

876
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:49,517
It was me.

877
01:23:49,924 --> 01:23:51,949
- I killed him.
- No.

878
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,286
I killed all of them.

879
01:23:53,495 --> 01:23:55,588
There's no such thing
as the Boogeyman.

880
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:57,321
It was me.

881
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:02,393
Start evacuating the building.

882
01:24:03,571 --> 01:24:05,061
Come on.
Everybody out of here.

883
01:24:05,273 --> 01:24:07,002
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

884
01:24:07,809 --> 01:24:09,777
Put your hands behind your back.

885
01:24:20,021 --> 01:24:22,080
- Cut the string.
- Let's go.

886
01:25:33,728 --> 01:25:35,423
So how'd you do it?

887
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:38,531
How'd you get your boyfriend
into all those pieces?

888
01:25:41,035 --> 01:25:44,596
You don't expect us to believe
you actually ripped him apart, do you?

889
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:48,572
It was me. I did it.

890
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:54,871
Okay.

891
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,968
We have to get out of here.

892
01:26:15,403 --> 01:26:16,734
This is Officer Young.

893
01:26:16,938 --> 01:26:19,964
The elevator seems to be stuck
between the first and second floors.

894
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:22,643
Requesting immediate assistance.

895
01:26:23,311 --> 01:26:25,438
<i>Say again, Officer Young.
You're breaking up.</i>

896
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:31,478
We have to get out of here
right now.

897
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:33,381
Just calm down.
They'll get us in a second.

898
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:35,647
This is Officer Young
requesting assistance.

899
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:39,452
The elevator is stuck between the first
and the second floors. We need...

900
01:27:06,454 --> 01:27:08,513
This is DJ Def Jeff...

901
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:14,389
...the voice of Woodbridge
University's radio WZXB.

902
01:27:14,596 --> 01:27:16,962
I hope all of you
freshman listeners...

903
01:27:17,165 --> 01:27:20,191
...managed to survive
the first week of classes.

904
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:22,096
Here we go.

905
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:27,503
Campus radio sucks.

906
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:31,474
Jennifer, did you hear me?

907
01:27:34,582 --> 01:27:36,516
I'm trying to study.

908
01:27:36,718 --> 01:27:39,016
Nobody studies
the first week of classes.

909
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:40,983
You're cray.

910
01:27:42,323 --> 01:27:45,087
So was the last girl who lived here.

911
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:47,992
What are you talking about?

912
01:27:48,396 --> 01:27:49,886
That girl.

913
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:53,226
The one who thought
the Boogeyman was killing everyone.

914
01:27:53,835 --> 01:27:56,065
The RA told me this was her room.

915
01:27:56,504 --> 01:27:59,871
- You're so full of shit.
- I'm serious.

916
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:02,932
It all happened in our building.

917
01:28:03,144 --> 01:28:04,805
Seriously?

918
01:28:05,313 --> 01:28:07,042
They just changed the name...

919
01:28:07,248 --> 01:28:09,842
...so no one would be scared
to live here.

920
01:28:11,386 --> 01:28:13,911
After all, who wants to live
in a building...

921
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:17,387
...where they found bodies
in the heating vents?

922
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:32,034
What's wrong, are you scared?

923
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:33,864
I'm annoyed.

924
01:28:36,544 --> 01:28:38,705
I'm going to the library.

925
01:28:39,881 --> 01:28:41,781
Where it's quiet.

926
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:45,247
Come on, I was just kidding around.
I'll be quiet.

927
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:49,413
I will see you in the morning.

928
01:28:50,358 --> 01:28:52,588
Seriously, I'll be quiet.

929
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:57,628
You don't wanna be in here alone,
do you?

930
01:28:58,366 --> 01:28:59,628
Don't be ridiculous.

931
01:29:06,207 --> 01:29:07,731
Hey, Amy.

932
01:29:07,942 --> 01:29:10,103
Don't let the Boogeyman get you.

933
01:29:17,618 --> 01:29:19,279
Whatever.

934
01:29:38,406 --> 01:29:40,601
Changed your mind, huh?

935
01:29:40,808 --> 01:29:44,039
Too scared to walk
to the library alone?

936
01:30:20,448 --> 01:30:23,315
Jennifer, you're hilarious.

937
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:26,049
Wait.

938
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:28,347
It's not Jennifer.

939
01:30:28,756 --> 01:30:30,656
Who could it be?

940
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:33,287
No.

941
01:30:33,494 --> 01:30:36,395
Is it the Boogeyman?

942
01:30:41,402 --> 01:30:44,735
All right, I admit it.
I was scared, okay?
