1
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,470
Twenty questions. Go.

2
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,902
You're a man. Are you in politics?

3
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,783
Warm beer. Tastes like piss.

4
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,627
It's your turn, babe.

5
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,622
Dead or alive?

6
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:18,098
Don't you think that's
a really stupid question these days?

7
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,874
You know, he's kind of an asshole,

8
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:23,773
but if you need me
to take care of him, I will.

9
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:24,868
I can hear you.

10
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:27,607
He's the one in the family
with all the brains.

11
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,171
Is that right?

12
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,051
All right, the interstate's coming up.
What do we do?

13
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:41,492
Don't get on it. Stay on this back road.

14
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:43,052
How come every time you say that,

15
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,065
we end up in a three-hour scenic tour
in the middle of nowhere?

16
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,725
Look, we agreed on the rules, didn't we?

17
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,894
And by taking it, we're breaking what?

18
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,564
The rule that says
we shouldn't take the interstate.

19
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,803
"I guess we wouldn't want
to break any rules," he said,

20
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:59,311
drinking his beer
as he drove the stolen Mercedes

21
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:03,042
ridiculously over the speed limit,
and, look, no hands!

22
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,912
- Babe, don't!
- Stop!

23
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,652
- Stop it, you moron!
- Don't!

24
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:19,926
- All right, smartass, I'll read the map.
- Can you? It has actual writing on it.

25
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,299
Very funny.

26
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,001
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

27
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,013
Hey, guys.

28
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:40,215
All right, windows, everybody.

29
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,755
What the hell is this guy doing?

30
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,554
My daughter and I, we ran out of gas.

31
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,500
All right, sir,
please move your car out of the road.

32
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:58,902
We left Denver yesterday morning.
Last gas we got was Colorado Springs.

33
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:02,133
I'm sorry, we can't help you.
Now move your car!

34
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,733
Look, all we need
is just a little bit of gas.

35
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,437
Yeah, I'm sure you do.
You and everybody else.

36
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,241
Stay where you are!

37
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,407
We can trade you for it.
We got food and water.

38
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:13,510
- Brian, we have more than enough.
- More than... How do you know that?

39
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,818
- I said do not get any closer!
- Brian, he looks clean.

40
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,881
Or he could be incubating.
Think about it for a second...

41
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,018
Guys! She's got it.

42
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:22,587
Shit!

43
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,259
Come on, come on, come on...

44
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,315
They'll die out there.

45
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:47,843
Everyone dies.

46
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:59,429
<i>The rules are simple.</i>
<i>At least, that's how my brother sees it.</i>

47
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,761
<i>One, avoid the infected at all costs.</i>

48
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,671
<i>Their breath is highly contagious.</i>

49
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:11,537
<i>Two, disinfect anything they've touched</i>
<i>in the last 24 hours.</i>

50
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:16,509
<i>Three, the sick are already dead.</i>
<i>They can't be saved.</i>

51
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,342
<i>You break the rules, you die.</i>

52
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,786
<i>You follow them, you live.</i>

53
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:24,984
<i>Maybe.</i>

54
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,246
Hey. Look what I found.

55
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,810
Great.

56
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:56,151
Hey, if you happen to find a brand-new
factory-issued oil pan, holler.

57
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:05,896
- Are you sure you can't fix it?
- It's blown, lvy Boy.

58
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,539
- Brian.
- What?

59
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,940
All that car needed was gas.

60
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:26,241
Wait, what? No. No, no, no way.

61
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,284
- Lf we sit here, we're just gonna die.
- We won't if we go back?

62
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:33,758
You saw the girl.
You saw the blood, the rashes.

63
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:36,926
Bobby, come on, you saw her.

64
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,295
- Am I the only one here?
- Kate, we do not have a lot of options...

65
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,594
They're your rules!

66
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,828
Danny, tell your girlfriend
to get her shit together.

67
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,100
- I'm not his girlfriend.
- She's not my girlfriend.

68
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:51,338
All right, then tell me, tell me.
Why the hell is she here?

69
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,646
Why didn't we let her sit tight
in her McMansion,

70
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,114
- waiting for the looters?
- Okay.

71
00:06:57,184 --> 00:07:01,416
Could we just calm down and try
and think this thing through? Please.

72
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:05,117
- Yeah.
- So what about the car?

73
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,051
I don't know, Danny. I'm trying to think.

74
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,825
- Well, we need that car...
- I know that!

75
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:16,861
Shit!

76
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,277
All right, put your masks on, guys.

77
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,227
Frank Holloway.

78
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,166
We're gonna need your car.

79
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,471
Yeah, I figured as much.

80
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,720
Do you really want to splatter
your brand-new vehicle

81
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:13,191
with the insides of someone who,
for all you know, may be infected?

82
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,060
We got loads of Clorox.

83
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,265
- Cleanup is not my chief concern.
- Brian, that's all right.

84
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,596
- That's close enough.
- I picked up a radio transmission

85
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,660
from a school outside of Farmington
last week.

86
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,135
People from all over the state
are traveling there.

87
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,469
For what?

88
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,605
The CDC, they set up some kind
of emergency response center.

89
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,646
They've got a new serum.

90
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,941
That's one hell of a story, man.
I don't think I've heard that one yet.

91
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,143
Are they getting results?

92
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,118
No, they're not getting any results, Kate.

93
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:44,247
They've got a new treatment, and I am
taking my daughter there in this car.

94
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:47,521
Now, if you're onboard with that, great.
If not...

95
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,555
This is a fairytale, and he knows it.

96
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,223
It's the Baltimore vaccine all over again.

97
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,927
It's a bunch of retrovirals
that don't work for shit.

98
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,764
So go ahead, Brian.
Shoot him in the head.

99
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,326
Wait! Hey.

100
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,532
I got an idea.

101
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:32,829
Hey.

102
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,009
Want to know a secret? About boys?

103
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,936
Their bark is worse than their bite.

104
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,339
- You know what I mean?
- No.

105
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,112
- It's okay.
- Don't listen to her, kiddo.

106
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:50,514
- Trust me, she loves it when I bite.
- Why don't you eat me, Brian?

107
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,549
- I think we can arrange that.
- Jesus, Brian! She's, like, eight.

108
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:57,395
Yeah, well, mentally, so is he.

109
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,655
<i>Adiós,</i> Road Warrior.
You crap piece of shit.

110
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,896
<i>But Godless governments have fallen,</i>

111
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,165
<i>and the armies of man</i>
<i>have perished by his hand...</i>

112
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,638
Pattycake, pattycake...

113
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:45,872
<i>... for this pandemic is the flail of God</i>
<i>and the world his threshing floor,</i>

114
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,971
<i>and, implacably,</i>
<i>he will thresh out his harvest</i>

115
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:53,611
<i>until the wheat is separated from</i>
<i>the chaff, the righteous from the sinner.</i>

116
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:58,347
<i>And make no mistake about it,</i>
<i>there shall be far more chaff than wheat.</i>

117
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,249
<i>Few chosen...</i>

118
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:04,057
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen much weed around lately.

119
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,429
- Very funny.
- What?

120
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,071
Just show some respect.

121
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,972
For what?
That God's punishing my daughter?

122
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,210
Who's he rewarding? Who, you?

123
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:22,677
- That's not what I'm saying.
- What are you saying?

124
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,910
Some people locked themselves away,
piled up food,

125
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:28,283
didn't even pick up the phone.
They were dead in a week.

126
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,379
Me, I worked at the stadium,
digging those mass graves for 400...

127
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:33,153
- 400 bucks a day!
- That's exactly right.

128
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,322
You can laugh all you want,
but I was up to my knees in that shit,

129
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:37,556
and here I am.

130
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,225
So you're immune or chosen
or something?

131
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,026
I'm here and they're not.

132
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,637
So, then, I guess you won't mind
kissing my daughter good night for me,

133
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,072
huh, Brian?

134
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,005
I didn't think so.

135
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,947
So much for being chosen, huh?

136
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,578
That's hysterical, huh, lvy League?

137
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,321
Where'd you go to school, Danny?

138
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,227
- He got a scholarship to go to Harvard.
- Yale.

139
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:14,391
- It was Yale, actually.
- It doesn't really matter, does it?

140
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:18,597
A little something shut the place down
before freshman orientation.

141
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:22,773
- Watch it, Brian.
- How's that for a knee-slapper?

142
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:26,074
- Why do you have to be such a dick?
- Come on!

143
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:27,943
Watch out! Watch out!

144
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,121
You! You stay in the back, you hear me?

145
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,962
Hey, I will if you keep your eyes
on the goddamn road!

146
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,730
Hey, you can get out anytime!
You can get out right now!

147
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:55,467
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Kate! Kate!

148
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:59,670
The tape held.
You don't have to worry about it.

149
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:04,480
Are you okay? What is it?

150
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:14,157
Damn it.
I think she knocked a filling loose.

151
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:15,751
I weep for you.

152
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,199
It's locked.

153
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,738
Danny, be careful.

154
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:35,278
It's okay.

155
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,717
Shit.

156
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,140
Hey, are you all right? Danny!

157
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,373
What happened?

158
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,845
Jesus!

159
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,251
Just get the gas and let's go.

160
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:35,537
Hey, kids, we'll be back in 20.

161
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,805
Yeah, we'll be back in more like five.

162
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,205
Shit.

163
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,106
Bobby! Baby?

164
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,243
- What's that?
- That?

165
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,748
Well, Brian and I,

166
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,127
we had a dad, too.
He was just like yours.

167
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:02,361
And every summer, when we were little,
he would take us to this place.

168
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,096
It's Turtle Beach.

169
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:09,908
And we could swim and surf,
and we'd fish

170
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:15,009
<i>and eat these soft-shell crab</i>
<i>sandwiches that were soaked in mayo.</i>

171
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,677
Were there lots of turtles?

172
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,814
Lots? God, there were thousands
of them! They were everywhere.

173
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:29,490
<i>I mean, you could barely put your foot</i>
<i>in the water without stepping on one.</i>

174
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:32,861
Sometimes they'd be stacked up
on top of each other.

175
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:36,331
- That's impossible!
- It is possible.

176
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,229
- They were everywhere.
- Can we go to Turtle Beach with them?

177
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,132
Time to sleep.

178
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:49,072
What makes you think
you're gonna be safe there?

179
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,312
It's an old motel.

180
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:57,450
The place has been abandoned
for years. We'll go on scavenging trips

181
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:01,015
and quarantine ourselves
every single time we get back,

182
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:04,055
- and wait.
- Until they come for us.

183
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:08,065
Until... Until the disease dies off.

184
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:11,227
The disease or the people?

185
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,933
It's the same thing, really.

186
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,840
<i>Bobby, I love you,</i>

187
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:24,277
and you know
what a dipshit I can be sometimes...

188
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:27,548
What's the big deal?

189
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:33,114
I think we should see other people.

190
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:38,689
If that's the way you feel.

191
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,496
It is the way I feel.

192
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,333
- You can be such a dipshit sometimes.
- I know!

193
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:55,038
Probably the biggest in the world
at this point.

194
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:19,028
Do you ever think of Yale?

195
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,076
Yeah. Sure.

196
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:30,273
That, and all those things
you think you'll get to do someday.

197
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,350
Jesus!

198
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:42,523
- Put it out! Put the fire out!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

199
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:47,091
Where do you think you're going, boy?

200
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,900
- Hurry up.
- Hurry.

201
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,869
Just keep it down. Keep it down.
Put it out.

202
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:58,662
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- Daddy.

203
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,561
Honey, I'm just going in there

204
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,294
to make sure
there are no monsters under the bed.

205
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,098
If there are monsters, you shouldn't go.

206
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:08,832
Okay, now listen to me.
There's no reason to worry. All right?

207
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,603
I'll be back before you can say
Captain Feathersword.

208
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,473
Captain Feathersword.

209
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,873
You're too smart for me, you know that?

210
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,677
I'll stay with her.

211
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,111
Bobby.

212
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,788
Look, now is not the time, okay?

213
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:26,052
The girls need some alone time
to talk about boys.

214
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:33,127
I am serious.
Do not get too close to her.

215
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:37,735
I'm serious. Just go. It's gonna be fine.

216
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,171
You know, you are always doing
whatever the hell you want.

217
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,143
That's why you love me!

218
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,390
Hello?

219
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:10,495
Hello?

220
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:52,007
Looks like your hospital
ran out of patients, Frank.

221
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,979
Come on. Let's get out of here.

222
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,389
Where's Kate?

223
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:10,852
- What is she doing?
- Kate?

224
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,459
- We have to go. There's nothing here.
- You don't know that.

225
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,330
Kate, they failed. Let's go.

226
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:19,303
There's a whole wing
we haven't checked yet.

227
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,971
You see? There are people here.

228
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:24,701
Wait!

229
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:45,462
No way.

230
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,900
Oh, my God. They did it.

231
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:06,780
- Sir. Sir!
- Yes?

232
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:13,757
- Are you in charge here?
- No, you want Dr. Lindus.

233
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:17,392
His office is on the second floor
of the old math building.

234
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:20,660
But you won't find him there.
He died on Thursday.

235
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,400
Doctor, we've come all the way
from Colorado.

236
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:24,697
We heard that you had a serum here.

237
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,536
It's my daughter, she's...
My daughter is very sick.

238
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:33,876
- How long?
- A little over a week.

239
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:37,578
- Is she bleeding from her ears yet?
- No.

240
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,410
Well, bring her in.

241
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:47,949
Okay, kids, these nice people
are gonna take you to your parents,

242
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,720
who are all waiting outside.

243
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:55,096
So, as soon as we finish our medicine,
we'll all be right as rain.

244
00:23:55,167 --> 00:24:00,298
What are you doing to these kids?
What's that? Where's the serum?

245
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:04,774
The serum? Yes, we had a serum.

246
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:09,975
For three days it stabilized the patients.
A few actually improved.

247
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,417
Three days.
That's the best that we could do,

248
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,111
or anyone else in the world
as far as I know.

249
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,351
Staved off the virus for three days.

250
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:22,155
Prolonged sickness and pain
for 72 hours.

251
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:24,924
Well, I'm not prolonging it anymore.

252
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:28,489
- What's in the punch?
- Potassium.

253
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:31,695
Lots and lots of potassium.

254
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:36,364
Now, if you'll excuse us.

255
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:43,607
No! No, stop! You can't do this!

256
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,276
Kate, they're sick. They're already dead.
Let's go.

257
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:48,513
- Brian, they are kids.
- Who's dead? My daughter's alive!

258
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:49,747
She's not dead!

259
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,756
- There are other places...
- Stop pulling the goddamn curtain!

260
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,054
Please! Please.

261
00:24:56,729 --> 00:25:00,130
- Give me your gun.
- Frank, stay where you are!

262
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,935
- Give me your gun, Brian.
- Frank, you know I can't do that.

263
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,595
Give me the gun!

264
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,600
Danny!

265
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:15,104
Stop. Stop! Stop, goddamn you!
Stop it! Now!

266
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,640
Put that down.

267
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:22,182
- Put it down!
- Look around you.

268
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,182
We lost power two weeks ago.

269
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,960
We sucked the town dry of gas
just to run the generators.

270
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,825
There's nothing left.

271
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:42,500
Don't. Please don't.

272
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:49,381
Sometimes choosing life is just
choosing a more painful form of death.

273
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:42,766
You're telling me your favorite cartoon's
name is Mop-Face Circle-Shirt?

274
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:45,463
- No!
- Brush-Bill Soup-Jeans?

275
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:49,598
No! SpongeBob SquarePants!

276
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:53,207
Spoon-Lips Boxer-Shorts!

277
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,456
Frank! Frank!

278
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:15,890
Okay. You're gonna be okay, just...

279
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,063
Okay, listen. Breathe slow.

280
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:27,810
Okay, okay.

281
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:21,858
We're getting out of here.

282
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,168
What happened?

283
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:35,077
Nothing. She took it off.
She had problems breathing, I think.

284
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:42,150
- Come here.
- Daddy? I have to go.

285
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:47,955
- Number one or number two?
- Number two.

286
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:51,754
Can you hold it?

287
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,500
Well, how about if I get you, like, a potty
or something, can you do it here then?

288
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,060
No.

289
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:07,469
All right, now. I need you to be
a very big girl for me right now.

290
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,705
Okay? I need you to be really brave.

291
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:14,081
You see those little blue huts
over there?

292
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,448
I need you to go over there by yourself,

293
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:19,491
and I'll be waiting
right here for you, okay?

294
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:22,123
- Can you try that for me?
- Okay.

295
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:26,787
- Good girl. You ready?
- Ready.

296
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,228
Come on.

297
00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:35,636
I'll be waiting right here for you, okay?

298
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:54,722
- Okay, honey. It's okay.
- Daddy.

299
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,818
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

300
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:02,997
You did great. I'm very proud of you.
Now Daddy will take you, okay?

301
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:10,531
You strike me as a good man, Daniel.

302
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:20,345
We'll be back in a minute.
Come on, honey.

303
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:34,893
Get in.

304
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:46,408
- Get... Get in the car!
- We can't leave them here. Not here.

305
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:48,207
Look, we brought them here.
That was the deal.

306
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,044
Now, it's time to drop the fairytales
and move on.

307
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:55,450
You heard what that doctor said.
There's nothing here. There's nothing!

308
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,349
You already put us in danger
once back there.

309
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:02,518
Bobby? Bobby, say something.

310
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:25,040
Hey, what was that song... What was
that song Miss Stevens taught you

311
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:27,915
- that you used to sing all the time?
- <i>Itsy Bitsy Spider.</i>

312
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:30,045
<i>The ltsy Bitsy Spider,</i> yeah.
Do you remember how to sing that?

313
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:35,583
<i>Ltsy bitsy spider went up the waterspout</i>

314
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:41,494
<i>Down came the rain</i>
<i>and washed the spider out</i>

315
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:47,571
<i>Out came the sun</i>
<i>and dried up all the rain</i>

316
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:53,910
<i>And the itsy bitsy spider</i>
<i>went up the spout again</i>

317
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:25,439
How long till the beach, Danny?

318
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:31,945
At least two days. Why?

319
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,187
Anyone for 18 holes?

320
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:50,065
If we're gonna stop somewhere
for the night, might as well be high-end.

321
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,295
Right?

322
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:55,604
- What do you say, Bobby?
- Do whatever you want, Brian.

323
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:46,417
Hello!

324
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:49,687
Hello!

325
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:57,128
The service here is for shit.

326
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:09,505
Hey.

327
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,808
Hey.

328
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:22,055
- You all right?
- Yeah.

329
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,459
Hey.

330
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:39,470
Look, what happened back there...

331
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:47,284
I'm just trying
to get us to the beach alive.

332
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:52,384
- You know that, right?
- Yeah, I know.

333
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:58,321
We all agreed on the rules.

334
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:03,366
And the sick, they're dead.
There's nothing we can do for them.

335
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,596
Right.

336
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:10,231
- All right, I should go check the back.
- Okay.

337
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,290
Okay. Knock it off, stupid, you're fine.

338
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,697
Hey, Danny! I found the pool!

339
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:54,411
You want to play Marco Polo?

340
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,632
- Shit!
- Help!

341
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,561
Help!

342
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:17,802
Oh, Jesus Christ! Danny!

343
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,431
Let's play some golf.

344
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:01,716
Jesus! Yeah!

345
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:21,699
Hey, are you okay?

346
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,474
I thought golf was for old people.

347
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:28,642
- Fuck.
- Jerk!

348
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:38,923
Come on down here, baby.

349
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:42,722
- What?
- Help me out of here.

350
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:49,198
Come on, it'll be just like the time
we broke into Forest Oaks.

351
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:53,102
Remember how the groundskeeper
booted us out?

352
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:54,263
Yeah.

353
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:58,334
Well, this time we're members.
They can't touch us.

354
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:02,541
It's nice and soft.

355
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:09,884
Just come out of there. Come on.

356
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,052
Just give me a hand.

357
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:31,304
- Come over here! Get over here!
- Brian! Stop it!

358
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:33,708
Come on! Don't!

359
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:37,439
What?

360
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:41,051
- I'm gonna get all dirty!
- It's sand!

361
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:43,680
Yeah, sand is dirt, asshole!

362
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,735
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

363
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:02,637
it's the 18th hole, and
young Brian Green steps up to the tee.

364
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:06,010
He needs a hole in one here
to get to the Masters,

365
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:10,377
but what he's really worried about
is people finding out that he's gay!

366
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:11,847
God damn it!

367
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:17,752
Dude, my advice to you
is put the club down, wait 10 minutes,

368
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:20,388
and just never pick it up again.

369
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:24,622
If it's so funny, show us what you got.

370
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:27,988
Thanks, but I think I'll use
an actual driver.

371
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,433
It's getting down to the wire, folks.

372
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,670
- Katie, Kate, whatever her last name...
- Shut up!

373
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,275
- All right!
- Nice.

374
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:49,776
Shit, the girl can swing!

375
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:53,253
Fairfield Country Club
Junior Champion three years in a row,

376
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:56,953
thank you very much.
Tiger Woods can kiss my ass.

377
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:00,123
Yeah!

378
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:09,029
Oh, shit.

379
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,141
Yeah!

380
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:39,196
<i>Larry?</i>

381
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,695
<i>Larry, come in.</i>

382
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,134
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

383
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,437
<i>If you're there, pick up.</i>

384
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:57,682
<i>We're coming back. Do you hear me?</i>
<i>We're coming back.</i>

385
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,864
What are you doing?

386
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,265
What the hell are you doing?

387
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:21,134
All day long, every single phone!
The phones are dead.

388
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:26,578
So, I just gotta try
and get in touch with my parents.

389
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:28,379
They're dead, too.

390
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,749
- You don't know that.
- I don't? Where were they?

391
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:37,092
Their cruise ship was quarantined
in Piraeus.

392
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,130
- Then they're dead.
- How do you know?

393
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:45,429
- You don't even know where Piraeus is!
- It doesn't matter where Piraeus is!

394
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:49,667
Everyone, everywhere, is dead,
your parents, my parents.

395
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:52,374
Soon you and I will be dead, too.

396
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:04,517
Kate, what happened?

397
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:06,924
- Leave me alone.
- Please.

398
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,493
What did she say to you?

399
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,689
Brian?

400
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,131
- That's not Brian.
- No.

401
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,236
- Shit!
- <i>We got them!</i>

402
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,039
<i>This way!</i>

403
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:51,878
<i>Up on the second floor!</i>
<i>It's a mess up here!</i>

404
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:16,811
Who are you,
and what the hell are you doing here?

405
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,280
Who are you?

406
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:20,880
Maybe we'll be able to talk
once we get rid of this.

407
00:45:20,952 --> 00:45:23,785
No! Don't touch me!
Please, don't touch me!

408
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:29,685
We've been out a couple of days
scouting for supplies! We just got back!

409
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,125
<i>Let him go!</i>

410
00:45:33,431 --> 00:45:34,489
<i>Now.</i>

411
00:45:41,372 --> 00:45:42,999
<i>We got everybody?</i>

412
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,198
- <i>I think so.</i>
- There's nobody else.

413
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:46,334
<i>Tom!</i>

414
00:45:47,278 --> 00:45:48,905
- <i>My space.</i>
- <i>What?</i>

415
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:52,280
<i>They breached it. It's not safe.</i>

416
00:45:53,151 --> 00:45:55,415
<i>I can't... It's not safe!</i>

417
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:02,217
That's what you get
for living in a condom, man.

418
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:04,124
- You get...
- Screw you.

419
00:46:05,563 --> 00:46:09,363
Hey, leave him alone!
We just wanted to spend the night here!

420
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:13,667
<i>You sons of bitches.</i>
<i>What have you done with Larry?</i>

421
00:46:21,546 --> 00:46:23,673
How the hell do I know, man?

422
00:46:24,215 --> 00:46:25,773
Maybe he got in a fight
with a shower curtain

423
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,875
like the rest of you guys.

424
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,189
<i>Larry. He was guarding the place.</i>

425
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,497
<i>They killed him.</i>

426
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:45,627
- He was like that when we got here.
- <i>Yeah, right.</i>

427
00:46:45,703 --> 00:46:47,933
<i>You expect us to believe that?</i>

428
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:50,039
Why don't you go in the pool,

429
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,905
check out the cause of death
for yourself?

430
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,406
- What, no volunteers?
- <i>Shut up.</i>

431
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:01,975
<i>Tom, he must have been sick</i>
<i>when we left and didn't say anything.</i>

432
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,220
<i>That's impossible.</i>
<i>You know that's impossible.</i>

433
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:05,755
<i>The system is perfect.</i>

434
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:09,190
- <i>Why? Because you thought of it?</i>
- <i>He didn't seal up his suit properly.</i>

435
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:12,252
<i>He made a mistake.</i>
<i>He didn't follow procedure.</i>

436
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,054
Whatever gets you through the night.

437
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:21,069
<i>You know, I just met you</i>
<i>and I'm already sick of you.</i>

438
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:25,000
- I have that effect on people.
- Brian, cut it out! Jesus!

439
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:30,806
<i>I want all of you out of here. Now.</i>

440
00:47:39,924 --> 00:47:40,982
Hey!

441
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:43,457
- Please, we need that.
- <i>So do we.</i>

442
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:45,589
<i>Get in.</i>

443
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:49,692
- <i>Not you.</i>
- What? Danny.

444
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:54,270
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>
<i>Let the girl go.</i>

445
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:57,202
- <i>The girls stay.</i>
- No!

446
00:47:57,742 --> 00:47:59,801
- <i>Yeah, they stay.</i>
- Get your hands off me!

447
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:03,313
- Don't you touch her, you son of a bitch!
- <i>Don't move!</i>

448
00:48:04,015 --> 00:48:05,277
<i>Get back!</i>

449
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,316
<i>If we keep the girls,</i>

450
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:12,447
<i>what are you gonna do with the guys?</i>
<i>Kill them?</i>

451
00:48:12,523 --> 00:48:14,753
<i>We're not that kind of people.</i>

452
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:16,084
<i>Yeah?</i>

453
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:21,460
<i>And what kind of people are we?</i>
<i>The kind that just sits and waits to die?</i>

454
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:24,593
Wait.

455
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:30,231
<i>Screw you, Tom! This isn't the mill.</i>
<i>You're not in charge anymore.</i>

456
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:32,936
<i>Let the girls go.</i>

457
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:50,551
<i>We have to check them out.</i>
<i>Make sure they're clean.</i>

458
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:51,788
<i>Right.</i>

459
00:48:58,336 --> 00:48:59,496
<i>Strip.</i>

460
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:02,465
- Please, no.
- <i>I said strip!</i>

461
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:25,289
<i>Shit, shit, shit, shit!</i>

462
00:49:25,363 --> 00:49:27,695
- <i>What's going on?</i>
- <i>Oh, my God! Back off! Back off!</i>

463
00:49:27,765 --> 00:49:30,700
- <i>Somebody tell me what's going on!</i>
- <i>Stay away from her!</i>

464
00:49:30,768 --> 00:49:33,396
- <i>What the hell is going on?</i>
- <i>I said go!</i>

465
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:34,996
<i>Shit!</i>

466
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:44,605
<i>Get the hell out of here right now!</i>
<i>I said, right now!</i>

467
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,240
This one's locked.

468
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,474
- I'm gonna look inside.
- I'll go check the back.

469
00:51:39,363 --> 00:51:40,523
Danny?

470
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:08,021
Do you want to end up like them?

471
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:15,494
We will if she stays.

472
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:21,136
Talk to him.

473
00:52:26,744 --> 00:52:28,974
- Brian?
- Help me out, will you?

474
00:52:30,848 --> 00:52:32,406
We need to talk.

475
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:35,509
The key to the pump
has to be here somewhere.

476
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:39,317
- Brian, we need to deal with...
- Where the hell is that key?

477
00:52:57,241 --> 00:52:58,765
Get in the car.

478
00:53:10,721 --> 00:53:11,915
Get in.

479
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,262
Any luck?

480
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:47,648
Brian.

481
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:58,629
Get out.

482
00:54:03,874 --> 00:54:05,398
I said get out.

483
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:17,311
- I'll get in the back.
- That's not what I said.

484
00:54:33,237 --> 00:54:35,262
Brian, please let me stay.

485
00:54:38,242 --> 00:54:40,540
Brian, please don't!

486
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,977
Brian, do not do this!

487
00:54:44,148 --> 00:54:46,946
- There's a town down that road.
- These are just bruises.

488
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:48,507
I've been bouncing around
in the back of that

489
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:50,553
- stupid car for days.
- I'm sure there's plenty of water in town,

490
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:54,819
- but here's half a gallon.
- Of course I have bruises, but I am fine!

491
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,525
- Lf you ration it...
- I love you.

492
00:54:58,028 --> 00:54:59,689
...it should last a few days.
- You love me, don't you?

493
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:04,257
- The same goes for the food.
- Brian, I'll wear a mask. I didn't know.

494
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:06,359
Like hell you didn't know!

495
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:09,669
- I...
- Don't you do that!

496
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,070
Don't you lie to me!

497
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:13,966
I wasn't sure.

498
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:20,674
Please don't leave me here!
Please, won't you help me?

499
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:33,156
When you get to town,
you find a comfortable place,

500
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:34,857
you know, with a good bed.

501
00:55:38,102 --> 00:55:41,265
And get yourself a blanket,
even if it feels hot now.

502
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:45,168
And lots of water.

503
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,372
Do it before you're too weak.

504
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:54,980
Brian. Brian!

505
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:57,946
I warned you about the girl.

506
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:00,685
- You...
- I told you to stay away from her.

507
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:03,750
Why the hell
couldn't you have listened to me?

508
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:08,624
She was choking. She couldn't breathe.

509
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,765
- Brian.
- Hey, hand me a beer, will you?

510
00:57:06,657 --> 00:57:07,988
Warm beer.

511
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:11,420
Tastes like piss.

512
00:57:21,872 --> 00:57:23,806
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

513
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:26,172
- It's almost gone.
- I know that!

514
00:57:31,415 --> 00:57:32,473
Car.

515
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:34,983
- I see it.
- We gotta make them stop.

516
00:57:35,052 --> 00:57:37,384
Yeah, we'll just wave politely
and ask for help.

517
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,479
Brian. Brian!

518
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:57,538
Hey! I'll deal with this.

519
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:07,315
- Stay where you are!
- Don't come any closer!

520
00:58:07,384 --> 00:58:11,718
I'm gonna stay right here.
We just need some gas.

521
00:58:12,923 --> 00:58:17,860
- Sorry. We don't have any to spare.
- I know. I understand.

522
00:58:21,632 --> 00:58:24,658
But I was just hoping
that maybe as a fellow Christian,

523
00:58:24,735 --> 00:58:28,102
- you might be able to help us.
- Please don't do that.

524
00:58:29,206 --> 00:58:32,334
You see, my wife in the car,
she's pregnant.

525
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:36,610
We're just looking for a cool place
to have the baby,

526
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:40,711
- see this thing through.
- Go in reverse. Let's go. Let's go.

527
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:42,215
Good luck.

528
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:44,410
- Go, go, go.
- Ma'am.

529
00:58:44,488 --> 00:58:46,353
- No, I can't.
- Please.

530
00:58:46,423 --> 00:58:48,015
I'm begging you!

531
00:58:50,928 --> 00:58:52,259
No, Brian!

532
00:58:56,934 --> 00:58:58,162
Get out!

533
00:59:00,304 --> 00:59:01,532
Get out!

534
00:59:40,377 --> 00:59:41,776
Get the gas.

535
00:59:43,814 --> 00:59:44,906
Oh, God.

536
00:59:57,127 --> 00:59:58,822
What are you doing?

537
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:01,625
They weren't gonna give it to us, Danny.

538
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:03,899
Help her out.

539
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:11,536
You don't talk to me. You hear me?
You don't tell me what to do!

540
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:16,768
Don't walk away from me,
you son of a bitch! I'm talking to you!

541
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,082
- What the...
- I am talking to you,

542
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:23,777
and I'm telling you what to do,
you self-righteous shit!

543
01:00:24,254 --> 01:00:26,916
It must be nice sitting on the sidelines

544
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,958
while your dumb brother
wades in shit for you.

545
01:00:29,026 --> 01:00:31,256
- No, I don't...
- Somebody had to do it.

546
01:00:31,328 --> 01:00:32,989
- Was it gonna be you, Danny?
- You didn't have to...

547
01:00:33,063 --> 01:00:35,759
You remember...
You remember our last day at home?

548
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:39,727
It wasn't you who went up to Mom
and Dad's room to get his gun, was it?

549
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:43,500
It wasn't you! It wasn't you
who had to go up there and lie

550
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:47,134
and tell them not to worry,
that you'd be back real soon.

551
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:50,878
- They were alive? Alive?
- You knew they were.

552
01:00:51,448 --> 01:00:55,179
They were? You... You told me...

553
01:00:55,252 --> 01:01:00,519
- What you wanted to hear.
- You asshole! Asshole!

554
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:05,651
Come here. Come here.
I'm an asshole for what?

555
01:01:05,729 --> 01:01:07,356
Tell me, Danny, asshole for what?

556
01:01:07,464 --> 01:01:08,726
For what?

557
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:12,093
For letting you walk by
with a clean conscience?

558
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:16,438
Well, that's what you like, Danny.

559
01:01:18,442 --> 01:01:19,966
Remember Bobby?

560
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:24,141
You remember Bobby?

561
01:01:24,748 --> 01:01:26,807
I was the one that had to drag her
out of the car

562
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:30,341
while you just sat there
watching me do it!

563
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:40,521
Bobby was right.

564
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,500
You got all the brains.

565
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,560
<i>Danny.</i>

566
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:34,266
Hey. Brian.

567
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:40,780
Stop here.

568
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:44,978
Brian. Brian.

569
01:03:45,722 --> 01:03:46,848
We're gonna stop at this house, okay?

570
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:50,222
We're gonna find something
to dress your wound with.

571
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,225
Whatever you say, Doc.

572
01:04:21,825 --> 01:04:24,521
Danny. There.

573
01:04:34,938 --> 01:04:36,803
A little closer.

574
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:39,707
Keep going. Okay, stop.

575
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:16,839
Hello?

576
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:37,826
Hello!

577
01:05:41,571 --> 01:05:44,768
If you can hear me,
we just need medical supplies.

578
01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:50,102
Someone's hurt.

579
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:56,545
We're not infected,

580
01:05:59,022 --> 01:06:01,320
and we don't mean you any harm.

581
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:03,687
We're...

582
01:06:04,728 --> 01:06:08,755
We're just gonna take what we need,
and we'll leave.

583
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:35,347
What happened? Oh, shit!
What's on you?

584
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:45,125
It's not contagious. It's not human blood.

585
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,288
It's dog blood.

586
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:55,763
- You had me worried, little brother.
- I'm sorry.

587
01:07:58,341 --> 01:07:59,330
Sorry.

588
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:10,481
Hey, don't take this the wrong way.
Can you pull down your pants?

589
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:43,081
Hey, so much for being chosen, huh?

590
01:08:47,891 --> 01:08:49,222
I'm sorry.

591
01:09:20,757 --> 01:09:22,725
He's got it, doesn't he?

592
01:09:28,598 --> 01:09:29,690
Shit!

593
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:38,368
<i>I don't know if there's anybody listening,</i>

594
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:41,940
<i>but my generator is dying.</i>

595
01:09:42,879 --> 01:09:47,441
<i>So, if there is someone out there,</i>
<i>this is my last song.</i>

596
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:52,477
<i>This is Laura Merkin,</i>
<i>last survivor of Corpus Christi, Texas,</i>

597
01:09:53,156 --> 01:09:55,386
<i>saying goodbye.</i>

598
01:10:11,608 --> 01:10:13,200
Can I see those?

599
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:42,001
Bobby had this crazy idea.

600
01:10:45,308 --> 01:10:47,208
She wanted to be a mom.

601
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:53,344
Can you believe that?

602
01:10:55,518 --> 01:10:56,746
Why not?

603
01:10:59,389 --> 01:11:00,617
With me?

604
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:07,788
There are some things
I'm just not good at, man.

605
01:11:11,668 --> 01:11:13,431
Where did she get...

606
01:11:15,672 --> 01:11:16,866
A baby?

607
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:27,105
Who knows?
Maybe I would have been good at it.

608
01:12:32,882 --> 01:12:34,543
Hey, Danny. Danny?

609
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:41,053
I gotta tell you something. It's a secret.

610
01:12:42,892 --> 01:12:44,917
You want to hear a secret?

611
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:49,497
- Sure.
- At the stadium,

612
01:12:54,904 --> 01:12:57,338
some of those people, they were...

613
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:01,870
They were still alive, Danny.

614
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:07,674
We were gonna dump them in the grave
and then...

615
01:13:09,285 --> 01:13:11,253
Some of them would move.

616
01:13:14,157 --> 01:13:16,182
I'd look at the supervisor,

617
01:13:18,194 --> 01:13:20,321
and he'd pretend not to see, so...

618
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:25,297
So we'd pretend not to see them,

619
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:29,002
but we did.

620
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:33,106
We did, and we'd bury them anyway.

621
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:38,042
- There were so many bodies, Danny.
- I know.

622
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:41,145
- So many.
- I know.

623
01:13:44,187 --> 01:13:46,382
How the hell did we get here?

624
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:53,484
- I don't know, Brian.
- You know.

625
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:57,632
We both know.

626
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:01,069
We both know.

627
01:14:03,673 --> 01:14:05,140
We both know.

628
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:08,709
We both...

629
01:14:51,087 --> 01:14:52,987
Where you going, Danny?

630
01:14:59,729 --> 01:15:01,526
Where you going, man?

631
01:15:02,765 --> 01:15:04,562
We're leaving, Brian.

632
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:19,537
- Come on.
- Come on, come on, come on, come on!

633
01:15:23,152 --> 01:15:25,848
- Shit!
- Oh, my God.

634
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:04,849
I need those keys, Brian.

635
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:07,020
Sure.

636
01:16:09,265 --> 01:16:10,926
And I need a ride.

637
01:16:13,636 --> 01:16:16,662
- You know I can't.
- Come on, Danny.

638
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:23,136
The ocean, you and me, one more time.

639
01:16:24,981 --> 01:16:26,949
You remember how it was.

640
01:16:28,351 --> 01:16:31,946
Hitting those waves
before everything turned to shit.

641
01:16:33,489 --> 01:16:35,354
Just give me the keys.

642
01:16:37,193 --> 01:16:38,683
You want them?

643
01:16:39,862 --> 01:16:43,696
Shoot me or take me with you.

644
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:51,338
- Brian, don't do it.
- I'm not gonna end up like them, Danny.

645
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:56,176
Rotting alive, alone.

646
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:00,912
You can't tell whether they're alive
or dead.

647
01:17:00,983 --> 01:17:03,451
Please, Brian. Don't.

648
01:17:06,889 --> 01:17:09,619
- It's what we decided.
- I'm dying, Danny!

649
01:17:12,762 --> 01:17:15,287
I don't give a fuck about the rules.

650
01:17:19,068 --> 01:17:20,558
You made them.

651
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:24,766
My little brother.

652
01:17:26,909 --> 01:17:29,309
I taught him everything he knows.

653
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:28,993
<i>I drive and wait for a storm to come</i>

654
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:32,536
<i>and wash us all away,</i>

655
01:18:34,677 --> 01:18:36,201
<i>but it doesn't.</i>

656
01:18:41,584 --> 01:18:43,381
<i>It's a beautiful day.</i>

657
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:47,612
<i>And it shouldn't be a beautiful day.</i>

658
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:52,254
<i>I wait,</i>

659
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:56,855
<i>but nothing happens to me.</i>

660
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:05,338
<i>And for the first time,</i>
<i>I feel like I am alone in the world.</i>

661
01:19:20,823 --> 01:19:24,987
<i>We made it.</i>
<i>Two strangers with nothing left to say.</i>

662
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:33,024
<i>Brian and I used to love this place,</i>

663
01:19:34,403 --> 01:19:36,837
<i>the hotel, the beach.</i>

664
01:19:41,677 --> 01:19:46,546
<i>They still look exactly the same,</i>
<i>but they're just places now.</i>

665
01:19:57,893 --> 01:19:59,952
<i>Brian! Danny! Come on!</i>

666
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:02,429
<i>I don't know what'll happen next.</i>

667
01:20:03,499 --> 01:20:05,831
<i>I don't know how long I'll live.</i>

668
01:20:15,444 --> 01:20:17,537
<i>But I know I will be alone.</i>
