00:00:16,481 --> 00:00:18,384
<i>Greg, alcoholic.</i>

3
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:20,053
<i>Hi, Greg.</i>

4
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:22,120
<i>You know, I really didn't
want to come today.</i>

5
00:00:22,153 --> 00:00:23,722
<i>My whole drive here
I was thinking,</i>

6
00:00:23,756 --> 00:00:24,990
<i>"This is bullshit.</i>

7
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:27,794
<i>I can skip just one more day."</i>

8
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:31,030
<i>But that's what I got
to tell myself, right?</i>

9
00:00:31,062 --> 00:00:32,798
<i>Because those thoughts,
I mean, that's...</i>

10
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:35,368
<i>that's my fucking disease
talking,</i>

11
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:37,370
<i>that says that I don't need
to be here,</i>

12
00:00:37,402 --> 00:00:39,604
<i>I don't belong here,
I'm not like you.</i>

13
00:00:39,637 --> 00:00:41,973
<i>You people are fucking losers.</i>

14
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:44,743
(melancholy music)

15
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:51,116
Natalie, breaks are
seven minutes.

16
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:52,818
It's been nine already.

17
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:54,019
<i>She was a fucking loser</i>

18
00:00:54,052 --> 00:00:55,754
who just dragged me down,
right?

19
00:00:55,787 --> 00:00:57,522
I was just a sucker
who got caught

20
00:00:57,555 --> 00:00:58,757
acting like a loser.

21
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,425
I don't need to be here.

22
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:04,162
<i>I'm not like you.</i>

23
00:01:04,195 --> 00:01:06,531
<i>And then I look in the mirror,</i>

24
00:01:06,564 --> 00:01:11,471
<i>and I go, "Oh, shit,
that fucking loser is me."</i>

25
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,073
How was the mission trip?

26
00:01:15,106 --> 00:01:16,876
Your mom told me
it was quite an adventure.

27
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:18,978
- Nigeria, right?
- Nicaragua.

28
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,978
Right, that's what you said.

29
00:01:20,012 --> 00:01:21,546
I always get those two confused.

30
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:23,748
Well, good for you
doing the Lord's work.

31
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:25,584
Must have been so depressing,
though.

32
00:01:25,617 --> 00:01:26,952
All those poor people.

33
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,254
I want to do
something like that,

34
00:01:28,287 --> 00:01:29,889
but I just worry
about the mosquitoes.

35
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:32,057
Weren't you worried
about the mosquitoes?

36
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,327
<i>But, today, I know
that the day I actually start</i>

37
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,430
believing that I don't need
this program,

38
00:01:37,462 --> 00:01:40,932
that I don't need other people
to help me stay sober,

39
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:44,970
that's the day
that I take my next drink.

40
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,606
<i>Guess who my roommate was.</i>

41
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,575
- Guess.
- Who?

42
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:52,177
Cassie Rubinec.

43
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,112
If they'd had "most likely
to end up in rehab,"

44
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:57,516
like, I definitely would've
voted for Cassie.

45
00:01:57,549 --> 00:01:59,751
So I have to tell
those thoughts that tell me

46
00:01:59,784 --> 00:02:02,087
that I don't belong here,
that I don't need you people

47
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,355
to shut the fuck up

48
00:02:03,388 --> 00:02:05,290
because that is
my disease talking,

49
00:02:05,323 --> 00:02:07,959
<i>and my disease is trying
to fucking kill me.</i>

50
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:09,528
<i>And it will, I've seen it.</i>

51
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:12,298
<i>It does. It killed her.</i>

52
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:17,402
My sponsor is always saying
that, um,

53
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:19,939
some must die
so that others may live,

54
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:23,376
and that's just
some really heavy shit.

55
00:02:25,477 --> 00:02:26,611
I don't know.

56
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:30,216
I'm just... I'm just gonna
keep coming back,

57
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:33,451
because I didn't end up
in these rooms by accident.

58
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:34,954
Right?

59
00:02:34,986 --> 00:02:37,490
None of us did.

60
00:02:37,522 --> 00:02:39,824
Right?

61
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:42,395
(coughing)

62
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:49,903
(squeaking)

63
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,481
(knocking)

64
00:03:03,514 --> 00:03:05,483
- Nat?
- Yeah.

65
00:03:05,516 --> 00:03:07,919
Can I come in?

66
00:03:07,953 --> 00:03:09,688
- Guess what I found?
- Mm.

67
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,356
- Honey, don't pick.
- I'm not picking.

68
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:13,091
- Now, look, it's all red.
- It's fine.

69
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,092
What did you find, Mom?

70
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:16,229
Well, Anya needs
some photographs

71
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,463
for her campaign,
so I was going through

72
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:22,368
all our old albums
and I found this.

73
00:03:24,068 --> 00:03:26,538
Do you remember this?

74
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:28,007
Mm-hm.

75
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:31,243
That was your last dance concert
in New York.

76
00:03:31,276 --> 00:03:33,878
You were so beautiful.

77
00:03:33,912 --> 00:03:36,048
Makes me wish you hadn't quit.

78
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,783
Yeah? You like me better
with an eating disorder?

79
00:03:38,817 --> 00:03:40,686
Oh, stop it.

80
00:03:40,718 --> 00:03:44,623
You didn't have
an eating disorder.

81
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,492
Okay, Mom.

82
00:03:48,993 --> 00:03:51,463
How was the meeting?

83
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,665
It was fine.

84
00:03:52,698 --> 00:03:53,966
Did you find a sponsor?

85
00:03:53,998 --> 00:03:56,201
Uh, I think, yeah, maybe.

86
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,870
What's her name?

87
00:03:57,902 --> 00:03:59,204
He. Greg.

88
00:03:59,237 --> 00:04:01,606
Greg. I always liked that name.

89
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,707
Yeah, we'll see.

90
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:03,809
Uh, honey, we have some takeout

91
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:04,844
from that place on Main Street.

92
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,078
Can I... can I bring you a tray?

93
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,579
No, I'm tired.
I'm just gonna go to bed.

94
00:04:07,612 --> 00:04:10,716
- Okay. Little soup?
- No. Thanks, Mom. Good night.

95
00:04:10,748 --> 00:04:12,717
- Hot tea?
- No, thank you.

96
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:14,954
Okay, good night.

97
00:04:14,986 --> 00:04:17,522
(intense music)

98
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,595
(music stops)

99
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:27,365
<i>Ooh, I can go all night.</i>

100
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:31,269
<i>Wishin' that you'd know
where to find me.</i>

101
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:35,141
<i>Ooh, I can't hide.</i>

102
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:39,411
<i>Wishin' that you'd know
where to find me.</i>

103
00:04:39,444 --> 00:04:43,516
<i>Feed me lines, feed me lines.</i>

104
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:45,183
<i>Feed me lines.</i>

105
00:04:45,216 --> 00:04:48,520
<i>Go on, feed me lines.</i>

106
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:50,855
(guitar music)

107
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:53,425
(bell jingling)

108
00:04:58,596 --> 00:05:01,866
Oh, hi there,
do you have an appointment?

109
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:04,502
Um, hello?

110
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:05,670
Excuse me.

111
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:07,038
Can I help you?

112
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:09,675
Family dinner tonight,
5:30 at Anya's.

113
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,678
I can't, Mom,
I've got a meeting at 6:00.

114
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:13,679
Excuse me.

115
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:16,514
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

116
00:05:16,548 --> 00:05:18,918
It's time.

117
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:19,985
I'm sorry?

118
00:05:20,017 --> 00:05:21,887
You owe me.

119
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,622
Um...

120
00:05:23,654 --> 00:05:25,957
I'm so sorry,
we don't take walk-ins.

121
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,193
Um, Laurie will take you
back to the desk

122
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:29,227
and make an appointment for you.

123
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:31,831
I have an appointment
with her.

124
00:05:31,863 --> 00:05:33,765
(soft music)

125
00:05:33,798 --> 00:05:37,402
You want to do this
in front of everybody?

126
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:45,144
I... sorry,
that took me a minute.

127
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:47,146
It was a free trial, right?

128
00:05:47,178 --> 00:05:49,814
Like, it was eyebrow threading.

129
00:05:49,848 --> 00:05:52,718
Let's just get you set up
in the pink room, okay?

130
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,286
I'll be right in.

131
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,721
I'm ready to collect.

132
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:58,758
Yeah, no, that sounds great.

133
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,759
Just give me one sec.

134
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,860
(door opening and closing)

135
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:04,997
You guys, her wristband says
"Paradise Lane Nursing Home,"

136
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:07,132
so just look 'em up and see
if they're missing a patient.

137
00:06:07,165 --> 00:06:08,334
Okay. Do you know her?

138
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,902
Of course I don't know her, Mom.

139
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:11,137
She's delusional.

140
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,572
Can you just call them, okay,
and I will keep her company.

141
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:14,907
Are you really gonna give her
free threading?

142
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:16,776
Do we do that?

143
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,646
(dryer whirring)

144
00:06:31,255 --> 00:06:34,225
I know I know you, I just...

145
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,061
I can't place it.

146
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:37,796
Oh, for fuck's sake.

147
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:39,464
You worked for me.

148
00:06:39,497 --> 00:06:42,701
Ramona's Lavender Farm.

149
00:06:45,403 --> 00:06:46,639
Oh.

150
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:47,840
Right, right, right,
right, right, right, right.

151
00:06:47,872 --> 00:06:52,010
Okay, to be fair,
that was, like, high school.

152
00:06:52,043 --> 00:06:53,278
Wait, no, no, no, hold on.

153
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:54,513
It was the summer
after high school

154
00:06:54,545 --> 00:06:57,682
because I was saving up
and I was, like...

155
00:06:57,716 --> 00:06:59,884
God, somebody that I knew
or did ballet with

156
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,055
or something, was it Caitlyn,
did her aunt...

157
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:04,990
Ramona.

158
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:07,927
Ramona. There you go. I got it.

159
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,495
Okay.

160
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:12,163
So...

161
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:14,365
- You owe me...
- I owe you.

162
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,536
- ...and I'm here to collect.
- Uh-huh.

163
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:18,704
Uh-huh.

164
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:21,173
Um, that was, what,
that was 15 years ago?

165
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:23,408
- That's a long time.
- Not to me.

166
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:25,244
Okay, well, it is to me.

167
00:07:25,276 --> 00:07:28,814
And I don't really remember...

168
00:07:31,382 --> 00:07:32,918
...really anything
from that summer

169
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:34,453
or, like, that time of my life.

170
00:07:34,485 --> 00:07:38,022
Um, honestly, I was...

171
00:07:38,055 --> 00:07:39,358
I was really fucked up
back then,

172
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:43,729
so I have no idea
what I could owe you.

173
00:07:48,432 --> 00:07:50,502
"To Eleanor Magnus,

174
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:53,238
I'm sorry I stole your money.

175
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:55,875
I promise to make it right.

176
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,810

178

Oh my God, this is amazing.

00:08:09,654 --> 00:08:12,123
I don't remember signing this.

180
00:08:12,156 --> 00:08:13,959
But you did.

181
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:15,995
This is so funny.

182
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,230
This is so... you know what,
I am really impressed

183
00:08:18,262 --> 00:08:19,564
that you held on to this
this whole time.

184
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:21,667
Like, you might be
the first person

185
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:25,036
in the history of IOUs
to actually collect on an IOU.

186
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:26,906
Are you dim?

187
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:29,775
That's the point.

188
00:08:29,807 --> 00:08:32,311
Read it. IOU.

189
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:34,914
Yeah, no, I get it.
I was just...

190
00:08:36,447 --> 00:08:38,583
That's so funny.

191
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:39,784
Okay.

192
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:40,752
Okay, how much?

193
00:08:40,785 --> 00:08:42,220
And I'm really sorry
about that, by the way.

194
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:43,489
That is fucked up,
but how much?

195
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:45,257
I will pay you back.

196
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:47,659
I don't want the money.

197
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:52,364
What do you want?

198
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:54,867
I want you to help me die.

199
00:08:57,201 --> 00:08:59,739
(chuckles)

200
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:05,577
Wait, wait.

201
00:09:07,211 --> 00:09:08,212
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

202
00:09:08,245 --> 00:09:09,881
Read it, IOU.

203
00:09:09,914 --> 00:09:11,516
Mm-hm, yeah.

204
00:09:11,549 --> 00:09:12,951
No, I know what that says,

205
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,821
but that is not an IOU
kind of thing.

206
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:18,389
Where does it say in that
that you have approval...

207
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:21,961
This is not legally binding,
and I was...

208
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,863
You know what? I was chasing
my Adderall with vodka

209
00:09:24,895 --> 00:09:26,731
when I signed this, like,
that's just not the headspace

210
00:09:26,764 --> 00:09:28,466
one should be in
when promising things.

211
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,868
Well, that's not my problem,
is it?

212
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,669
Wow, God, I think
I'm being really cool

213
00:09:31,702 --> 00:09:33,271
just offering
to pay you back at all.

214
00:09:33,304 --> 00:09:37,809
Are you under the impression
that we're negotiating?

215
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:40,044
Okay, can we just think
about this for a minute?

216
00:09:40,077 --> 00:09:43,115
I have thought about this

217
00:09:43,148 --> 00:09:45,951
for a long time.

218
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:51,523
You want to die?

219
00:09:51,556 --> 00:09:53,725
As soon as possible.

220
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:57,095
You did the right thing,
you did the right thing.

221
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,797
I'm very proud of you.

222
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,499
Hey, hey.

223
00:10:00,532 --> 00:10:01,567
Did you guys call?

224
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,036
Yeah, they're on their way.

225
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:07,572
- She's so old, it's so sad.
- Yeah, it's really sad,

226
00:10:07,605 --> 00:10:08,974
she doesn't even know
who she is.

227
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:10,241
God, if I ever get like that,
promise me

228
00:10:10,274 --> 00:10:12,745
you're just gonna take me
outside and shoot me.

229
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,313
(laughing)

230
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:20,351
<i>I could've kicked you out
when I caught you,</i>

231
00:10:20,384 --> 00:10:23,221
called the cops.

232
00:10:23,254 --> 00:10:25,890
Ramona wouldn't let me.

233
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:28,960
Okay, I'm trying
to remember Ramona.

234
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:31,463
Was she like a real hippie
with lots of freckles?

235
00:10:31,495 --> 00:10:33,499
She wasn't a hippie.

236
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,934
She just had freckles.

237
00:10:35,966 --> 00:10:36,835
Yeah.

238
00:10:36,868 --> 00:10:40,339
Yeah, no,
I totally remember her.

239
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:42,206
She liked you.

240
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,777
Never understood why.

241
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:47,011
That's where we're gonna do it.

242
00:10:47,044 --> 00:10:50,348
The lavender farm.

243
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:52,884
Oh.

244
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,519
Yes.

245
00:10:56,087 --> 00:10:58,389
Okay.

246
00:10:58,423 --> 00:10:59,792
How?

247
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,794
Well...

248
00:11:01,826 --> 00:11:05,431
I figure enough of that
Addall stuff that you do.

249
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:06,865
Adderall?

250
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:08,300
Is that what you meant,
Adderall?

251
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:09,567
Yeah.

252
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,870
Not gonna kill you.

253
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:14,406
Sorry. Big shot of heroin,
that'd do it.

254
00:11:14,438 --> 00:11:16,641
Okay, heroin.

255
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,413
Dude, I haven't done that shit
in a really long time.

256
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:24,850
Okay, like,
I wouldn't even know.

257
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,456
I'm sober.

258
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,424
So, another way.

259
00:11:33,457 --> 00:11:37,096
- How?
- I don't know.

260
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,800
Just not in that horrible place.

261
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:45,971
So, what, you live in,
like, a nursing home?

262
00:11:46,004 --> 00:11:47,706
It's not a home.

263
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:50,075
It's a torture chamber.

264
00:11:50,107 --> 00:11:52,777
They pump me full of pills
to keep my heart beating.

265
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:54,747
For what?

266
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:57,548
They get paid every month
to keep me laying there,

267
00:11:57,581 --> 00:12:00,619
dying slowly.

268
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:07,125
I want to be still

269
00:12:07,158 --> 00:12:09,660
the way I want to get still.

270
00:12:09,693 --> 00:12:12,030
That's all.

271
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:15,900
(knocking)

272
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:17,568
Ms. Magnus?

273
00:12:17,601 --> 00:12:20,004
(tense music)

274
00:12:20,038 --> 00:12:21,373
What did you do?

275
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:23,908
- I...
- What did you do?

276
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:26,144
- Ms. Magnus?
- What did you do?

277
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:27,278
- Hi.
- No.

278
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:28,614
- It's okay.
- No, please!

279
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,115
We're here to take you
back home.

280
00:12:30,148 --> 00:12:31,550
- No.
- It's okay.

281
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:34,019
No! Don't touch me. No!

282
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:35,486
We're here to help you,
it's all right.

283
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,422
No! No!

284
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:39,424
Don't let 'em do this, please!

285
00:12:39,456 --> 00:12:41,058
Please, don't let them take me!

286
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:42,693
It's not gonna be okay!

287
00:12:42,726 --> 00:12:43,828
Don't let them!

288
00:12:43,861 --> 00:12:46,365
(sustained high-pitched tone)

289
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,167
<i>Young lady?</i>

290
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:52,004
<i>Young lady...</i>

291
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,809
Would you like to share?

292
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,947
Young lady?

293
00:13:07,418 --> 00:13:09,954
Um, yeah, sorry.

294
00:13:09,988 --> 00:13:11,156
Um, I'm Natalie.

295
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:14,592
Mm, yeah, alcoholic and addict.

296
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,761
Hi, Natalie.

297
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:19,965
And?

298
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,001
Um...

299
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:28,874
I... I don't know,
I've got, like, um...

300
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:32,578
I mean, like, I think
tomorrow will be, like,

301
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,580
uh, is it like... I think
six weeks,

302
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,648
something like that.

303
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:39,184
Congratulations on six weeks.

304
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:41,986
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

305
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:43,889
Thank you.

306
00:13:43,922 --> 00:13:45,658
Yeah.

307
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,663
Sorry, what?

308
00:13:51,696 --> 00:13:54,066
You can pass if you want to.

309
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,335
Great, yeah.

310
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,204
I want to.

311
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:02,306
Okay.

312
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,043
Andrew.

313
00:14:12,082 --> 00:14:14,620
(birds chirping)

314
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:20,860
(intense music)

315
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,176
(music stops)

316
00:14:48,753 --> 00:14:51,123
I told you
that she would be late.

317
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:52,356
This is ridiculous.

318
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:54,625
(indistinct chatter)

319
00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:57,395
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

320
00:14:57,428 --> 00:15:00,731
Come on, it's weird, right?

321
00:15:00,764 --> 00:15:03,467
Hey, hi, Natalie!

322
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,036
So you found
an earlier meeting, huh?

323
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,739
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, happy to see you.

324
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:09,775
Okay, shoes off.

325
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:11,409
Okay, why are you freaking out?

326
00:15:11,442 --> 00:15:13,412
I just had the floors redone.

327
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,247
Did you not see my note?

328
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,881
What note?

329
00:15:16,914 --> 00:15:18,783
Did you lock the door?

330
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,818
Yes, Anya, we're safe
in the suburbs.

331
00:15:20,851 --> 00:15:22,620
Don't worry.

332
00:15:22,653 --> 00:15:24,789
- Hi, Daddy.
- Oh, hi.

333
00:15:24,822 --> 00:15:26,591
- Hey.
- Hi, guys.

334
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:27,759
It's so good to see you.

335
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:29,461
- How are you?
- I'm good.

336
00:15:29,494 --> 00:15:31,562
Hi!

337
00:15:31,596 --> 00:15:34,298
- Can you say hi?
- Hi, Chloe, hi.

338
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:35,933
Ooh, those look good.

339
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:37,869
Wow, she's gotten so big!

340
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:40,238
Okay, could we just... hi.

341
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,439
There's some things
that we need

342
00:15:41,472 --> 00:15:42,807
to go over, everybody.

343
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:46,010
So, Natalie, we have all
discussed this already.

344
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:48,279
Oh, this is a family meeting.

345
00:15:48,312 --> 00:15:50,115
Mom, I thought you said
it was a family dinner.

346
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:52,017
Oh, it i... it's a family dinner.

347
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:55,553
- It's a family meeting.
- And a dinner, Anya.

348
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:57,755
Which this pizza is getting
pretty cold, everybody.

349
00:15:57,788 --> 00:15:59,256
Come on, let's grab a plate.

350
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:01,793
(clanking)

351
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:05,564
Um, Natalie was telling me
how she, uh,

352
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:07,031
she may have found a sponsor.

353
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:09,801
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah, it's hard work.

354
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:10,868
Uh, Greg?

355
00:16:10,902 --> 00:16:12,336
Greg? Was that it?

356
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,471
I thought that women

357
00:16:13,504 --> 00:16:15,374
were supposed to sponsor
other women.

358
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,775
Well, Anya, it depends.

359
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:18,744
Well, so tell us
all about him.

360
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,912
Actually, I don't think
it's gonna work out with him.

361
00:16:20,945 --> 00:16:23,382
I'm a little bit worried
he might be hitting on me.

362
00:16:23,414 --> 00:16:25,716
That's why women
are supposed to sponsor women.

363
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,284
Do you want to be
my sponsor, Anya?

364
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:29,388
Do you want to go
and fuck yourself, Natalie?

365
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,723
Hey, can we try not to use
F-bombs, please?

366
00:16:31,755 --> 00:16:33,057
- Little ears.
- I'm sorry.

367
00:16:33,091 --> 00:16:36,293
I'm sorry. She's, you know...

368
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:38,663
Am I the only one
eating pepperoni here?

369
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:40,399
Nat, let me fix you a plate.

370
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,100
- I don't eat meat, Daddy.
- Still?

371
00:16:43,134 --> 00:16:44,836
Haven't eaten meat
since I was 13.

372
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:46,571
Oh, he knows that.

373
00:16:46,604 --> 00:16:48,440
Ed, you know that.

374
00:16:48,472 --> 00:16:51,008
I know that.

375
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:53,577
Did you see? We got a whole one

376
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,213
of just mushroom and spinach.

377
00:16:56,246 --> 00:16:57,548
Great, I'm gonna get a piece
in a minute, Mom.

378
00:16:57,581 --> 00:16:58,682
And I have salad.

379
00:16:58,716 --> 00:16:59,817
Do you want me
to make you a plate?

380
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,586
Oh my God, Mom,
she can get her own food.

381
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,791
Okay. Okay, Nat, so is there
like a central sign-up,

382
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,293
or how does
the sponsor thing work?

383
00:17:08,326 --> 00:17:11,529
Uh, Dad, would you like
to join this conversation,

384
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,198
or...

385
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,665
Ed?

386
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:15,967
Are you paying attention?

387
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,234
I'm listening, I'm here.

388
00:17:17,268 --> 00:17:18,836
I'm finishing a message,
thank you.

389
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,771
- Yeah, he's listening.
- Okay.

390
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:22,307
So my campaign is heating up,

391
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:24,308
and I'm going to need
everybody's help.

392
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:27,145
Oh, cool, I can help.

393
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:29,781
No, Natalie, I don't nee...

394
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:31,283
Okay.

395
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,719
I need to know that you are not
gonna fuck this up.

396
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:35,953
Oh, Anya, please.

397
00:17:35,987 --> 00:17:37,456
Mom, I'm serious!

398
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:38,923
How would I fuck it up?

399
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,759
Are you joking? Is she joking?

400
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,793
Let's do that, yeah.

401
00:17:42,826 --> 00:17:44,663
I think what Anya is doing
is huge, right,

402
00:17:44,695 --> 00:17:47,131
and I'm only gonna speak
for myself.

403
00:17:47,164 --> 00:17:48,700
I know that I don't want
to mess it up for her.

404
00:17:48,732 --> 00:17:49,867
- Yeah.
- And I think if we all

405
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:52,204
work together as a family
to do our best,

406
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,171
that it would be good to know

407
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:55,706
that you're doing
the same, right?

408
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,242
What does that mean?

409
00:17:58,276 --> 00:17:59,978
- Maybe I'm not...
- No, what is it?

410
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,546
I'm really asking.
What does that mean?

411
00:18:01,578 --> 00:18:04,382
Mom, go ahead, go ahead.

412
00:18:04,414 --> 00:18:05,517
What?

413
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:08,519
Mom, what?

414
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:17,261
As long as you are
living at home...

415
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:18,964
...and make no doubt about it,

416
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:22,100
you are welcome to live at home
for however long it takes,

417
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:27,072
but, um, as long as you are
living in our house...

418
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:29,641
Weekly drug tests, Natalie.

419
00:18:29,673 --> 00:18:30,975
Are you kidding?

420
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,077
We all feel
like we deserve to know

421
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:35,113
whether or not you are using
or drinking.

422
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:38,782
I have not had a drink
or, like, anything in, I mean...

423
00:18:38,816 --> 00:18:40,152
Tomorrow is gonna be six weeks.

424
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:41,185
- That's great!
- But why

425
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:42,487
isn't that enough for you?

426
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:44,221
Ugh.

427
00:18:44,255 --> 00:18:46,658
Nat...

428
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:48,860
Nat, we are so proud of you.

429
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:51,997
I have to get this, okay?

430
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:53,632
Dr. Grillo.

431
00:18:53,664 --> 00:18:55,099
Uh-huh.

432
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:57,269
- How long?
- Seriously?

433
00:18:57,301 --> 00:19:00,571
- He's on call, honey.
- Oh my God.

434
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:02,641
Just tell me that you get this.

435
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:06,177
If one of those tests
comes back positive,

436
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,378
they are gonna kick you out,
Natalie,

437
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:08,747
and this time it's for real.

438
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:10,248
- Oh, Anya, please.
- What?

439
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,082
Mom, this is what we agreed to.

440
00:19:12,115 --> 00:19:13,884
Oh, no, no, I haven't
agreed to anything.

441
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:15,853
Okay, but, Nat, you have
nothing to hide, right?

442
00:19:15,886 --> 00:19:16,954
- So what is...
- Are you...

443
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:18,823
There's a clinic in the city.

444
00:19:18,855 --> 00:19:19,990
It is very hush-hush.

445
00:19:20,023 --> 00:19:21,192
Jeremy has some connections.

446
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,829
Jeremy. Is that
your fuck buddy?

447
00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:27,298
Jeremy, my campaign manager.

448
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,935
- Who you used to fuck.
- Oh my God!

449
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,436
Natalie, that was in college.

450
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:33,638
- He's gay now.
- He's gay now?

451
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:35,507
No, see, I don't think
that's politically correct.

452
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:38,175
I think the LGBTQ community
would argue

453
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:39,277
that he was always gay

454
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:40,912
and find that statement
offensive.

455
00:19:40,944 --> 00:19:42,646
So, you know,
maybe I'm not the one

456
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,485
you need to worry about
fucking up your campaign.

457
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:53,124
I also need you
to start volunteering.

458
00:19:53,156 --> 00:19:54,792
- Oh, you need me to start.
- Just in case

459
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:57,461
someone gets wind of anything,

460
00:19:57,494 --> 00:19:59,630
we can point out the contrast
in your life

461
00:19:59,663 --> 00:20:02,300
between then and now.

462
00:20:03,768 --> 00:20:05,370
I'm already volunteering.

463
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:07,239
You are? Where?

464
00:20:07,271 --> 00:20:08,740
An old person's home.

465
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:10,274
A geriatric facility.

466
00:20:10,307 --> 00:20:12,810
- Which one?
- Uh, it's called Paradise Lane.

467
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:13,845
Look it up.

468
00:20:13,877 --> 00:20:15,179
Paradise La...

469
00:20:15,212 --> 00:20:16,748
Pa...

470
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,983
Was that the place today
with the lady?

471
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,218
- What lady?
- There was this lady,

472
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,420
this homeless,
yeah, crazy lady,

473
00:20:22,452 --> 00:20:24,388
and she just comes waltzing
into the sal...

474
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:26,825
Mom, she's not crazy
and she's not homeless.

475
00:20:26,857 --> 00:20:28,225
Okay, her name is Eleanor.

476
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:31,596
- So you do know her?
- Yeah, okay, I...

477
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:33,197
I didn't want to make
a big thing of it.

478
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,599
This is why we can't trust you

479
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:38,269
because you are constantly
being caught in lies.

480
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:41,306
- Oh, come on, she...
- Anya, stop. Okay, come on.

481
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:43,340
I just started
volunteering there

482
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:45,876
when I was an inpatient,
it's like this program

483
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,646
where you can choose
where you want to do service.

484
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,480
It's like this huge piece
of recovery.

485
00:20:49,513 --> 00:20:51,750
- That's it.
- That's wonderful.

486
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:53,050
Why didn't you tell us that?

487
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:54,653
I just...

488
00:20:54,685 --> 00:20:56,553
Look, I didn't think you guys
were gonna understand

489
00:20:56,586 --> 00:20:59,557
'cause, like, you know,
I've got to work every day,

490
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:01,358
but I'm supposed to go
to a meeting every day.

491
00:21:01,392 --> 00:21:02,927
And, you know,
according to the program,

492
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,461
like, service is
really important.

493
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:06,397
And Eleanor knows
I work at Bella's.

494
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:10,468
I think she just wandered out
and got lost.

495
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,170
You really expect us
to believe that?

496
00:21:12,202 --> 00:21:14,004
- Jesus Christ, Anya.
- Okay, listen, you know what?

497
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:16,807
This has all been
very productive, okay?

498
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,209
I will let Jeremy know
that he can make arrangements

499
00:21:19,242 --> 00:21:20,644
for the weekly drug tests.

500
00:21:20,678 --> 00:21:22,647
I will tell my team
that you already have

501
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,450
a steady volunteer position
just in case anybody wants,

502
00:21:25,482 --> 00:21:27,117
you know, some proof
that you're no longer

503
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:28,853
a criminal and a drug addict.

504
00:21:28,885 --> 00:21:30,120
- Oh, Anya.
- Hmm?

505
00:21:30,153 --> 00:21:31,323
Great, that was smooth enough.

506
00:21:31,355 --> 00:21:34,224
Yeah. Oh, and, Nat,
if you don't die

507
00:21:34,258 --> 00:21:36,394
from a drug overdose,
but you do die from lung cancer,

508
00:21:36,426 --> 00:21:38,462
that is really gonna
piss me off.

509
00:21:38,496 --> 00:21:41,032
So why don't you just get
a fucking nicotine patch

510
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:42,567
and cut this shit out?

511
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:45,069
- I don't smoke.
- She doesn't smoke.

512
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:48,239
I don't... I have
an early morning.

513
00:21:48,271 --> 00:21:50,008
She doesn't smoke.

514
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,777
She doesn't smoke,
and I can walk on water.

515
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:54,378
Jesus.

516
00:21:54,412 --> 00:21:57,548
Oh my God,
she needs to get laid.

517
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:58,683
All right.

518
00:21:58,715 --> 00:22:00,517
Well, I got to get Chloe back,
so, um...

519
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,920
- Well, I've got to find your...
- This was great.

520
00:22:02,953 --> 00:22:04,556
Real fun.

521
00:22:04,588 --> 00:22:06,256
I got to find your dad.

522
00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:07,459
- Mom, she's...
- You okay?

523
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:09,527
No, she's out of control.

524
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:10,894
Ed?

525
00:22:10,928 --> 00:22:12,931
We have to go now, honey.

526
00:22:12,963 --> 00:22:14,700
Ed?

527
00:22:21,705 --> 00:22:24,241
(distant barking)

528
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:29,548
(drumroll)

529
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:37,588
(intense music)

530
00:22:43,227 --> 00:22:45,764
(music stops)

531
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:57,041
Okay.

532
00:22:57,074 --> 00:22:59,611
(guitar music)

533
00:23:11,689 --> 00:23:13,725
Fuck.

534
00:24:00,904 --> 00:24:03,442
(buzzing)

535
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:07,144
(buzzing)

536
00:24:07,178 --> 00:24:09,714
(telephone ringing)

537
00:24:11,682 --> 00:24:13,284
Can I help you?

538
00:24:13,317 --> 00:24:14,818
Uh, yeah.

539
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:15,954
Hi, Jillian.

540
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:19,123
I'm here to see Eleanor Magnus.

541
00:24:19,155 --> 00:24:21,558
- Are you family?
- Yeah.

542
00:24:21,592 --> 00:24:24,496
Really? I didn't think she had
any family except her son.

543
00:24:24,528 --> 00:24:26,263
- Are you her...
- I'm her son's daughter.

544
00:24:26,297 --> 00:24:28,266
I'm her... so her granddaughter.

545
00:24:28,298 --> 00:24:31,001
Wow, I did not know
she had a granddaughter.

546
00:24:31,035 --> 00:24:32,971
- Mm-hm.
- From Midland, right?

547
00:24:33,003 --> 00:24:34,738
Mm, yeah, it's a good memory.

548
00:24:34,771 --> 00:24:36,374
Well, I remember thinking
it was strange

549
00:24:36,406 --> 00:24:38,175
he put in her a home
so far away,

550
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:40,178
but who am I to judge?

551
00:24:40,211 --> 00:24:41,546
When was that?

552
00:24:41,578 --> 00:24:44,648
Had to have been
about three years ago now.

553
00:24:44,682 --> 00:24:46,683
Wow.

554
00:24:46,717 --> 00:24:48,620
Yeah, no, three years,
that's about right, that's...

555
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,421
Well, she's not the only one.

556
00:24:50,453 --> 00:24:51,788
Tons of them like that.

557
00:24:51,821 --> 00:24:55,225
Nobody comes to visit,
not one single soul.

558
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:58,663
Anyway, what's your name?

559
00:24:58,695 --> 00:24:59,663
Uh, Anya.

560
00:24:59,696 --> 00:25:01,398
- Magnus?
- Yeah.

561
00:25:01,432 --> 00:25:04,434
Hm, I don't see your name
on the visitor list.

562
00:25:04,468 --> 00:25:06,204
- Really?
- But I can add you.

563
00:25:06,237 --> 00:25:09,274
- Okay, that'd be great.
- Can I see your ID, please?

564
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:13,076
Oh, this is so stupid,
but my wallet was stolen

565
00:25:13,109 --> 00:25:14,678
a couple of days ago,
so I don't have anything.

566
00:25:14,711 --> 00:25:16,881
I don't have a bank card or...

567
00:25:16,913 --> 00:25:19,116
Oh, that's okay.
Let me just call your dad

568
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,854
- and he can verify that...
- No, can you not do that?

569
00:25:22,886 --> 00:25:25,490
Um...

570
00:25:25,522 --> 00:25:27,190
Sorry, that's awkward,
but he just doesn't know

571
00:25:27,223 --> 00:25:29,961
that I'm here.

572
00:25:29,993 --> 00:25:32,129
Um...

573
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:35,767
Look, I drove all the way
from Midland to see her.

574
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:40,271
Please?

575
00:25:40,304 --> 00:25:42,641
She's my grandmother.

576
00:25:44,008 --> 00:25:45,109
Nurse?

577
00:25:45,142 --> 00:25:47,578
(telephone ringing)

578
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,214
Nurse?

579
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:51,915
- Nurse?
- No, I'm not...

580
00:25:51,949 --> 00:25:54,285
Let me see if I can...

581
00:25:54,317 --> 00:25:55,853
- Nurse?
- Um...

582
00:25:55,885 --> 00:25:58,021
Oh, hey, hey, I think
she might need something.

583
00:25:58,055 --> 00:26:00,424
Oh, she's fine.

584
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:04,662
Nurse?

585
00:26:08,965 --> 00:26:10,968
Nurse?

586
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:13,538
(beeping)

587
00:26:38,295 --> 00:26:40,264
I'm sorry.

588
00:26:40,297 --> 00:26:41,399
I want you to leave.

589
00:26:41,432 --> 00:26:44,134
I panicked, I just...

590
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:45,869
Look, I didn't mean
for that to happen.

591
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:48,373
You're a monster.

592
00:26:52,742 --> 00:26:56,480
Okay, yeah, that's fair.

593
00:26:58,782 --> 00:27:01,218
Yeah, I'm a monster,
you're absolutely right.

594
00:27:01,251 --> 00:27:02,019
Get out of my room.

595
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,187
Okay, here's the thing.
I can't.

596
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,288
- Nurse!
- Okay, first,

597
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,089
have you met the staff in here?

598
00:27:06,123 --> 00:27:09,594
Like, good luck getting
any attention from them.

599
00:27:11,261 --> 00:27:15,599
Okay, and, second,
I can't leave, okay, I can't

600
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:18,769
because if I leave,
then all I have ever done

601
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:22,073
is just destroy everything
and, like, everyone,

602
00:27:22,105 --> 00:27:24,307
and I haven't followed through
on anything ever,

603
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,977
and that just can't be my life.

604
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:29,346
It can't.

605
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,350
It can't.

606
00:27:32,383 --> 00:27:35,553
And I do realize that...

607
00:27:35,586 --> 00:27:39,990
...that killing you
might not be the best example

608
00:27:40,023 --> 00:27:41,725
of doing good,
but I'm pretty sure

609
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,560
it's better than doing nothing

610
00:27:43,594 --> 00:27:46,931
and, like, leaving you
in here to rot.

611
00:27:52,435 --> 00:27:53,837
And I might also need
some urine.

612
00:27:53,871 --> 00:27:55,673
- Oh, God.
- Hey, look at me.

613
00:27:55,705 --> 00:27:58,475
This is not... this is not
a deal-breaker.

614
00:27:58,509 --> 00:27:59,777
It's not.

615
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:01,178
That is nothing

616
00:28:01,211 --> 00:28:06,183
for breaking you out of here
and murdering you.

617
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:09,387
(dinging)

618
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,423
Come on.

619
00:28:20,163 --> 00:28:23,267
Side door.

620
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:26,169
By the trash cans.

621
00:28:26,202 --> 00:28:27,838
Midnight.

622
00:28:29,306 --> 00:28:31,843
(lively music)

623
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:41,919
What's, uh, what's going on?

624
00:28:41,951 --> 00:28:45,056
Um, so, Mom,
I think I found a s...

625
00:28:45,088 --> 00:28:48,692
I mean, no, I know
I found a sponsor.

626
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:50,495
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah.

627
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:51,895
- Is it a woman?
- Yes.

628
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:52,897
Good, good.

629
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,199
- What's her name?
- Jillian.

630
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:56,834
Oh, I've always liked that name.

631
00:28:56,866 --> 00:28:58,235
Yeah, yeah.

632
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:00,304
So, here's the thing,
she thinks that I need

633
00:29:00,336 --> 00:29:03,540
to, like, immerse myself more
in the program,

634
00:29:03,574 --> 00:29:05,076
and I think she's right.

635
00:29:05,108 --> 00:29:06,144
Okay.

636
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,411
Okay, uh...

637
00:29:08,444 --> 00:29:09,480
What does that mean?

638
00:29:09,512 --> 00:29:11,816
Well, there's this, like,
woman sobriety group

639
00:29:11,848 --> 00:29:13,083
that she thinks
that I should join,

640
00:29:13,116 --> 00:29:14,652
that you, like, meet
once a month

641
00:29:14,684 --> 00:29:15,720
in, like, different places.

642
00:29:15,752 --> 00:29:18,054
It's like this
weekend intensive, I guess.

643
00:29:18,087 --> 00:29:21,558
And this weekend
they're meeting in South Haven.

644
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:24,762
So, I just thought, you know...

645
00:29:24,795 --> 00:29:26,163
I mean, since the condo
is there

646
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:28,465
that maybe I could just go.

647
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:30,867
(soft music)

648
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:33,638
(sighs)

649
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,405
You know, honey,
if this were just up to me...

650
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:38,242
I mean, I...

651
00:29:38,275 --> 00:29:39,644
I'm fine with you missing work,

652
00:29:39,676 --> 00:29:42,146
obviously, but...

653
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:49,954
But your father
and the other kids,

654
00:29:49,987 --> 00:29:53,024
we agreed to these rules,
honey, and we agreed

655
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:55,425
that we are going
to stick to 'em

656
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:57,228
if you want to move back home.

657
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,730
I know, I know.

658
00:29:59,762 --> 00:30:01,531
And the doctor
was the one who...

659
00:30:01,565 --> 00:30:02,933
who helped us with those rules.

660
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,036
I mean, we didn't make them up.

661
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:08,905
And you are not supposed
to spend nights alone, right?

662
00:30:08,939 --> 00:30:11,676
Right.

663
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,945
And, you know, that is why
Jillian suggested

664
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,980
that we both stay
at Campbell's.

665
00:30:17,013 --> 00:30:19,750
Campbell's?

666
00:30:19,782 --> 00:30:21,184
That place is so overpriced.

667
00:30:21,218 --> 00:30:23,888
I know, that is why
I offered up the condo

668
00:30:23,921 --> 00:30:27,325
just because, you know,
it's there.

669
00:30:27,357 --> 00:30:29,493
(sighs)

670
00:30:30,994 --> 00:30:33,263
So, so...

671
00:30:33,297 --> 00:30:36,601
Jillian would be staying
with you at the condo.

672
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:37,934
Yeah, yes.

673
00:30:37,968 --> 00:30:41,739
No, I would be with sober women
the whole time.

674
00:30:41,771 --> 00:30:44,674
Okay, sober, Christian women.

675
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:46,878
It's a church thing.

676
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:48,746
I know.

677
00:30:48,778 --> 00:30:50,548
It's good.

678
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,083
I, uh...

679
00:30:53,116 --> 00:30:54,751
We're gonna talk
about this tonight.

680
00:30:54,785 --> 00:30:56,621
No, I can't, actually,
that's the thing.

681
00:30:56,653 --> 00:30:57,922
I'd have to leave
this afternoon

682
00:30:57,954 --> 00:31:00,124
because they have
this welcome dinner

683
00:31:00,156 --> 00:31:02,425
and this opening prayer,
and it's all tonight,

684
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:06,898
and I guess if you miss that,
then you can't participate.

685
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:09,200
So...

686
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:14,906
Okay. It's okay.

687
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,941
I'm just going to tell Jillian
I can't this weekend

688
00:31:16,973 --> 00:31:18,576
and, um...

689
00:31:18,608 --> 00:31:21,011
Honey, just... just wait, wait.

690
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,980
Uh...

691
00:31:25,782 --> 00:31:28,485
It's just for this weekend,
right?

692
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,020
Yeah.

693
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:34,125
And, like, I'll leave
a urine sample behind for Anya.

694
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:37,662
Could we meet Jillian?

695
00:31:37,694 --> 00:31:39,998
It's anonymous, Mom.

696
00:31:41,298 --> 00:31:42,933
But maybe I could
have her call you,

697
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:46,170
like, I don't know,
she might be willing to do that.

698
00:31:46,202 --> 00:31:48,105
- Maybe?
- Okay.

699
00:31:48,137 --> 00:31:50,573
Uh, that would be
my stipulation.

700
00:31:50,606 --> 00:31:53,344
Okay, she... she has to call us.

701
00:31:53,376 --> 00:31:55,046
Okay.

702
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:02,419
This is, uh, for an emergency.

703
00:32:02,452 --> 00:32:04,888
If you need gas, no,
if you need anything.

704
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:06,324
- It's fine.
- You have been living

705
00:32:06,356 --> 00:32:10,394
on such a tight budget lately,
and, uh, just...

706
00:32:10,426 --> 00:32:11,795
This is...

707
00:32:11,828 --> 00:32:14,698
This is between us, okay?

708
00:32:14,731 --> 00:32:17,999
Okay.

709
00:32:21,571 --> 00:32:24,975
I'm gonna figure this out, Mom.

710
00:32:28,211 --> 00:32:29,747
<i>Run to the storm.</i>

711
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:31,382
<i>Get the wind in your hair.</i>

712
00:32:31,414 --> 00:32:32,582
<i>Let it take you.</i>

713
00:32:32,615 --> 00:32:34,652
<i>Whoa, oh, oh.</i>

714
00:32:34,684 --> 00:32:36,153
<i>Run to the storm.</i>

715
00:32:36,185 --> 00:32:39,189
<i>When the sky falls down,
it will break you.</i>

716
00:32:39,222 --> 00:32:40,890
<i>Whoa, oh, oh.</i>

717
00:32:40,923 --> 00:32:43,360
<i>They might call you a sinner.</i>

718
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:47,498
<i>When the fire hails,
everybody is guilty.</i>

719
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,966
<i>I'll pray for the winter.</i>

720
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,505
<i>You'll be long gone
if the angels see ya.</i>

721
00:32:54,538 --> 00:32:57,575
<i>Ooh.</i>

722
00:32:57,607 --> 00:33:01,077
<i>Run to the storm.</i>

723
00:33:01,111 --> 00:33:04,215
<i>Ooh.</i>

724
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,417
<i>Run to the storm.</i>

725
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:09,819
<i>Run to the storm, don't say
no goodbyes, oh, no.</i>

726
00:33:09,853 --> 00:33:12,656
<i>Run to the storm.</i>

727
00:33:12,689 --> 00:33:16,293
<i>The reaper don't sleep,
don't close your eyes, oh, no.</i>

728
00:33:16,326 --> 00:33:19,063
<i>Run to the storm.</i>

729
00:33:19,096 --> 00:33:22,566
<i>So run to the storm,
don't say no goodbyes, oh, no.</i>

730
00:33:22,598 --> 00:33:25,336
<i>Run to the storm.</i>

731
00:33:25,368 --> 00:33:28,938
<i>Ain't nobody gonna speak,
won't hear no lies no more.</i>

732
00:33:28,971 --> 00:33:31,908
<i>Run to the storm.</i>

733
00:33:31,942 --> 00:33:35,546
<i>So run to the storm, don't say
no goodbyes, oh, no.</i>

734
00:33:35,578 --> 00:33:38,315
<i>No goodbyes.</i>

735
00:33:38,347 --> 00:33:42,853
<i>The reaper don't sleep,
don't close your eyes, oh, no.</i>

736
00:33:42,885 --> 00:33:45,423
(panting)

737
00:33:47,857 --> 00:33:50,394
(crickets chirring)

738
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:57,435
Okay, come on, hi.

739
00:34:01,137 --> 00:34:03,073
Come on.

740
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:07,377
Oh my God.

741
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:09,813
Hey, come on, get in.

742
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:10,881
Jesus Christ.

743
00:34:10,914 --> 00:34:13,451
(car door closing)

744
00:34:16,786 --> 00:34:19,322
(heavy breathing)

745
00:34:27,063 --> 00:34:29,232
Where are your pants?

746
00:34:29,266 --> 00:34:31,402
Laundry day.

747
00:34:31,434 --> 00:34:33,971
(funky music)

748
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,209
Oh my God, you're alive.

749
00:35:12,242 --> 00:35:14,478
You know, I actually started
to wonder if you died.

750
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,614
And if you had, I was gonna be
super happy for you,

751
00:35:16,646 --> 00:35:19,951
like, mission accomplished.

752
00:35:21,418 --> 00:35:23,220
Jesus.

753
00:35:23,253 --> 00:35:27,490
They keep a very tight control
over my fluid intake.

754
00:35:27,523 --> 00:35:28,893
That's all I could get.

755
00:35:28,925 --> 00:35:30,661
Just never seen pee this orange.

756
00:35:30,693 --> 00:35:32,396
No, no, no, it's good,
it's good.

757
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:34,632
It's just... it's gross,
but it's good.

758
00:35:34,664 --> 00:35:37,201
(music resumes)

759
00:35:48,144 --> 00:35:50,748
Oh my God, I wish I could
see her face in the morning.

760
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:54,083
Okay, I would like to have
this finished by tomorrow,

761
00:35:54,117 --> 00:35:56,187
Sunday at the latest.

762
00:35:57,753 --> 00:36:00,423
Okay, uh...

763
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:05,429
Here.

764
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:10,233
Get that thing off.

765
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:18,376
Just let me do it.

766
00:36:20,577 --> 00:36:22,513
(clacking)

767
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,983
Thank you.

768
00:36:27,483 --> 00:36:29,385
You're welcome.

769
00:36:29,418 --> 00:36:31,955
(bluesy music)

770
00:36:33,356 --> 00:36:36,427
<i>Go to the mountain,
we need higher ground,</i>

771
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,197
<i>where rivers and valleys
won't break us down.</i>

772
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:43,534
<i>Mothers and brothers
all gather round,</i>

773
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:46,336
<i>look up to the...</i>

774
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:49,272
So how are we gonna do this?

775
00:36:49,306 --> 00:36:50,441
What?

776
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:52,610
Close my final chapter.

777
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:54,445
Oh, I don't know.

778
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:57,981
Have you thought about,
like, how you want to...

779
00:36:58,014 --> 00:37:00,317
I don't want any surprises.

780
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:01,451
Okay.

781
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:04,021
- I don't want to suffocate.
- Uh-huh.

782
00:37:04,054 --> 00:37:06,257
Or cut my wrists,
anything bloody.

783
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:08,092
- Right.
- And I don't want

784
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:11,295
to be in pain
when it's happening.

785
00:37:12,795 --> 00:37:15,031
- Okay.
- Okay.

786
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,271
Is that it?
Is that all you got?

787
00:37:21,304 --> 00:37:24,474
I'd like to hear your thoughts.

788
00:37:24,507 --> 00:37:27,010
Oh. Um...

789
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:33,083
I think, like, um...

790
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:36,753
I mean...

791
00:37:36,786 --> 00:37:38,955
Illuminating.

792
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:41,257
Look, it's been
a really long day, okay?

793
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:43,059
I mean, my homicidal instincts
would be

794
00:37:43,092 --> 00:37:46,996
way more impressive
over coffee.

795
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,700
<i>Save yourself.</i>

796
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:53,871
<i>Don't hide in the shadows
that hit the room.</i>

797
00:37:53,903 --> 00:37:56,606
<i>Save yourself.</i>

798
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:01,411
<i>Don't run in the shadows,
run to the moon.</i>

799
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:09,186
(music stops)

800
00:38:19,762 --> 00:38:22,299
(drumroll)

801
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,607
(drumroll)

802
00:38:36,012 --> 00:38:38,548
(intense music)

803
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,796
(music stops)

804
00:39:29,632 --> 00:39:32,168
(crickets chirring)

805
00:39:39,141 --> 00:39:41,678
(clicking)

806
00:39:46,148 --> 00:39:48,685
(whooshing)

807
00:40:12,742 --> 00:40:15,278
(wind chimes tinkling)

808
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,876
(upbeat music)

809
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:50,713
<i>He rocks in a treetop...</i>

810
00:40:50,746 --> 00:40:51,848
Oh, make it stop.

811
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:54,751
<i>Hoppin' and a-boppin'
and a-singin' his song.</i>

812
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,688
<i>All the little birds
on Jaybird Street</i>

813
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:00,324
<i>love to hear the robin
go tweet, tweet, tweet.</i>

814
00:41:00,356 --> 00:41:04,126
<i>Rockin' robin,
oh, rockin' robin.</i>

815
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:07,029
- <i>Tweet, tweet.</i>
- <i>Rock, rock, robin.</i>

816
00:41:07,063 --> 00:41:08,097
<i>Tweet, tweet.</i>

817
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,132
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

818
00:41:09,164 --> 00:41:11,701
(coughing)

819
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,840
What the fuck?

820
00:41:22,177 --> 00:41:24,947
Those things will kill ya.

821
00:41:24,981 --> 00:41:26,917
Want one?

822
00:41:29,585 --> 00:41:31,921
(honking)

823
00:41:33,923 --> 00:41:36,626
What does that say? Trudy?

824
00:41:38,327 --> 00:41:40,596
- Truly.
- What does that mean?

825
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,666
You don't know
what "truly" means?

826
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:44,034
No.

827
00:41:44,067 --> 00:41:45,369
Obviously, I know what it means.

828
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:46,702
Why did you get it tattooed
on your arm?

829
00:41:46,735 --> 00:41:47,971
It's none of your business.

830
00:41:48,003 --> 00:41:49,405
Oh my God, what's your problem?

831
00:41:49,438 --> 00:41:51,841
We have no fucking plan.

832
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:53,277
I'm thinking.

833
00:41:53,309 --> 00:41:55,846
(coughing)

834
00:41:58,447 --> 00:42:01,184
(birds squawking)

835
00:42:04,253 --> 00:42:05,556
Oh, shit.

836
00:42:05,588 --> 00:42:07,590
- Oh, I completely forgot.
- What?

837
00:42:07,623 --> 00:42:09,058
Here, put it out,
I need a favor.

838
00:42:09,092 --> 00:42:09,893
Just put it out, please.

839
00:42:09,925 --> 00:42:11,161
It's the last favor,
I promise.

840
00:42:11,193 --> 00:42:12,228
Please put it out,
please put it out.

841
00:42:12,262 --> 00:42:15,032
It's gonna be fast.

842
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:17,099
Okay, so just remember, Jillian,

843
00:42:17,132 --> 00:42:20,303
and we just met yesterday,
and you are very Christian.

844
00:42:20,336 --> 00:42:22,306
Only idiots believe that shit.

845
00:42:22,338 --> 00:42:23,673
Well, my mom believes
that shit.

846
00:42:23,706 --> 00:42:25,842
Well, she must have
a small brain.

847
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:27,610
Can you...

848
00:42:29,878 --> 00:42:31,781
Okay, okay, just please
get it right, okay?

849
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:33,383
Just say that we're here
and it's all good.

850
00:42:33,416 --> 00:42:34,818
- And then...
- What?

851
00:42:34,851 --> 00:42:37,287
Okay, okay, we can kill you
however you want.

852
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,090
- Go.
- <i>Natalie?</i>

853
00:42:40,123 --> 00:42:42,159
Uh, no, this is Jillian.

854
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:43,827
I'm Natalie's sponsor.

855
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,429
<i>Yes, yes, of course!</i>

856
00:42:45,461 --> 00:42:47,396
It is so good to hear from you.

857
00:42:47,429 --> 00:42:49,332
<i>I have been calling Natalie
over and over,</i>

858
00:42:49,365 --> 00:42:51,735
<i>and it just... it goes
to voicemail.</i>

859
00:42:51,768 --> 00:42:54,403
<i>You know, I keep telling her,
"Don't let your phone die,"</i>

860
00:42:54,436 --> 00:42:56,572
but I don't know,
maybe the program feels

861
00:42:56,606 --> 00:42:59,409
differently about that,
I just...

862
00:42:59,442 --> 00:43:01,277
You know, I just always go
to the worst place

863
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:02,278
when I don't hear from her.

864
00:43:02,311 --> 00:43:04,714
<i>I understand.</i>

865
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,317
So, you, uh,
you're at the condo.

866
00:43:07,349 --> 00:43:09,585
Yes, it's beautiful.

867
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:12,722
- Such a lovely home you have.
- Thank you.

868
00:43:12,755 --> 00:43:15,625
I'm so glad
this all worked out.

869
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,327
<i>So, is Natalie there?</i>

870
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,264
She's in the other room,
praying.

871
00:43:21,297 --> 00:43:22,432
- Really?
- <i>Really?</i>

872
00:43:22,465 --> 00:43:24,233
That's wonderful.

873
00:43:24,266 --> 00:43:28,871
I know you must have been
through a lot with her.

874
00:43:28,905 --> 00:43:31,375
Yes. Yeah, we...

875
00:43:31,407 --> 00:43:32,476
<i>We all have.</i>

876
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:35,177
<i>It's been very hard, yes.</i>

877
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:37,613
What was the hardest thing?

878
00:43:37,646 --> 00:43:40,217
Well, I think the hardest part
has been on her.

879
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,019
<i>I can't imagine
what she's going through.</i>

880
00:43:43,052 --> 00:43:45,955
<i>I'm not an addictive person
and neither is her father,</i>

881
00:43:45,989 --> 00:43:48,992
so we're just... we're just
so confused.

882
00:43:49,025 --> 00:43:52,930
<i>Anything you tell me
remains between us.</i>

883
00:44:05,141 --> 00:44:07,510
It's the lies.

884
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:15,217
<i>She lies about so many things.</i>

885
00:44:15,251 --> 00:44:17,254
<i>Maybe not anymore.</i>

886
00:44:17,286 --> 00:44:20,823
<i>Oh my God, that'd be wonderful
for all of us, but...</i>

887
00:44:22,592 --> 00:44:25,762
The hardest part is the lies.

888
00:44:28,364 --> 00:44:30,132
She's my baby.

889
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:32,036
<i>I love her.</i>

890
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:36,807
<i>I want to trust her.</i>

891
00:44:39,509 --> 00:44:42,045
I want to trust her too.

892
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:50,586
(coughing)

893
00:44:57,025 --> 00:44:58,728
You don't have to do this,
you know?

894
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,530
Like, I mean, I sprung you.

895
00:45:00,563 --> 00:45:03,365
You're out of that shithole.

896
00:45:03,398 --> 00:45:05,634
I should just run off
into the sunset?

897
00:45:05,668 --> 00:45:07,304
You're obviously not gonna run,

898
00:45:07,336 --> 00:45:09,773
but, you know, yeah.

899
00:45:12,108 --> 00:45:14,244
My time is almost up

900
00:45:14,277 --> 00:45:18,414
now that I've stopped taking
all that crap.

901
00:45:18,447 --> 00:45:20,783
I'm a dead woman walking.

902
00:45:23,052 --> 00:45:26,890
God, that's a great name
for a band.

903
00:45:26,922 --> 00:45:28,625
Jesus.

904
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:34,431
What's wrong with you?

905
00:45:34,463 --> 00:45:37,666
They say I have
a big, baggy heart.

906
00:45:37,699 --> 00:45:40,803
So, why don't you just wait?

907
00:45:40,836 --> 00:45:43,340
I mean, if your heart
is just gonna give out anyway.

908
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:46,844
Because people are saved.

909
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:52,014
The body might want to go,

910
00:45:52,047 --> 00:45:54,416
but folks intervene.

911
00:45:54,449 --> 00:45:57,019
They can't bear
to let it happen.

912
00:45:57,052 --> 00:46:00,956
So the poor old sucker ends up
in intensive care

913
00:46:00,989 --> 00:46:03,459
on life support.

914
00:46:05,561 --> 00:46:08,798
You ever seen that up close?

915
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:13,103
Well, I have.

916
00:46:15,103 --> 00:46:17,106
With Ramona.

917
00:46:19,541 --> 00:46:22,880
And I'm not letting
that happen to me.

918
00:46:27,416 --> 00:46:29,952
(crinkling)

919
00:46:32,922 --> 00:46:35,692
Okay, um...

920
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,833
Well, what about your son?

921
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:49,139
I don't have a son.

922
00:46:49,172 --> 00:46:50,472
Yes, you do.

923
00:46:50,505 --> 00:46:53,109
- No, I don't.
- Yeah...

924
00:47:05,021 --> 00:47:07,624
So...

925
00:47:07,657 --> 00:47:10,327
You have a son.

926
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,096
And I just feel like...

927
00:47:14,697 --> 00:47:15,999
...like whatever your situation
is with him,

928
00:47:16,032 --> 00:47:18,635
like, I don't know,
but I just think

929
00:47:18,668 --> 00:47:20,202
that he should be me,
you know?

930
00:47:20,235 --> 00:47:22,739
Like, he should be the one
who is with you in the end.

931
00:47:22,771 --> 00:47:25,241
- Absolutely not.
- Well, he should

932
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:26,776
at least get a chance
to say goodbye.

933
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:28,445
He doesn't want to say goodbye.

934
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,914
Are you sure?

935
00:47:30,947 --> 00:47:32,883
I mean, sometimes I worry
that my parents think

936
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,918
I hate them, but I don't.

937
00:47:34,951 --> 00:47:39,623
And I would be
really, really hurt if they...

938
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:49,799
He lives in Midland, right?

939
00:47:51,567 --> 00:47:52,835
I know he lives in Midland.

940
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:55,739
- You manipulative little shit.
- That's three hours...

941
00:47:55,771 --> 00:47:58,741
We are not going to Midland!

942
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:02,112
You are taking me to the farm!

943
00:48:03,346 --> 00:48:04,648
(upbeat music)

944
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,916
<i>Pull the trigger,
draw the line.</i>

945
00:48:06,949 --> 00:48:10,119
<i>Stay on your side,
and I'll lie on mine.</i>

946
00:48:10,152 --> 00:48:11,654
<i>Gun, gun, gun.</i>

947
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:12,722
<i>Whoa.</i>

948
00:48:12,755 --> 00:48:14,557
<i>Gun, gun, gun.</i>

949
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:15,759
<i>Whoa.</i>

950
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:17,860
<i>Pull the trigger.</i>

951
00:48:17,893 --> 00:48:19,561
So what's your son's name?

952
00:48:19,594 --> 00:48:21,430
Stop talking about him.

953
00:48:21,463 --> 00:48:25,034
I can't even ask his name?

954
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,671
Henry.

955
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:30,106
I always liked that name.

956
00:48:35,478 --> 00:48:38,148
So what happened with you guys?

957
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:40,884
Oh, shit, just don't say
anything, okay?

958
00:48:40,916 --> 00:48:43,552
I just got to deal with this.

959
00:48:43,585 --> 00:48:45,120
- Hi, Mom.
- <i>Oh my goodness!</i>

960
00:48:45,153 --> 00:48:48,458
<i>Oh! I am so glad
you answered, honey.</i>

961
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:52,027
Uh, yeah, I'm on speakerphone
here with your dad.

962
00:48:52,061 --> 00:48:54,164
- Hi, Nat.
- Hi, Daddy.

963
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:56,066
<i>We, uh, we wanted
to just check in</i>

964
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:59,803
and see how everything was,
and, uh, is the group good?

965
00:48:59,835 --> 00:49:01,704
<i>Yeah, it's great,
I'm learning a lot.</i>

966
00:49:01,737 --> 00:49:03,672
<i>What's that noise?
Are you driving?</i>

967
00:49:03,706 --> 00:49:06,576
Yeah, we're just driving
to an...

968
00:49:06,608 --> 00:49:08,043
It's an overnight meeting.

969
00:49:08,077 --> 00:49:10,313
<i>Um, at a church
in Grand Rapids.</i>

970
00:49:10,346 --> 00:49:12,048
Well, that sounds like fun.

971
00:49:12,081 --> 00:49:14,517
Yeah, it's kind of like
sleep-away camp

972
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:15,752
but without the alcohol.

973
00:49:15,784 --> 00:49:17,420
But with Jesus.

974
00:49:17,452 --> 00:49:18,554
That's what we say.

975
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:21,091
No to alcohol, yes to Jesus.

976
00:49:21,123 --> 00:49:23,826
<i>I like the sound of that. Ooh!</i>

977
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:28,097
So, Jillian, does this group
have a name?

978
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,833
<i>Oh, we don't believe in labels.</i>

979
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:33,103
Okay, good.

980
00:49:33,135 --> 00:49:35,538
Look, Nat,
I have to take this call.

981
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:37,973
I'll see you soon.

982
00:49:38,007 --> 00:49:40,510
Okay, honey, so I forgot
to tell you,

983
00:49:40,543 --> 00:49:44,146
<i>Anya's campaign is doing
a video about the family,</i>

984
00:49:44,179 --> 00:49:45,848
and they went
to the nursing home

985
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:48,385
because they wanted
to get a sound bite about you

986
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:51,387
<i>and that sad, old lady
you take care of.</i>

987
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,188
Wait, what?

988
00:49:53,222 --> 00:49:56,126
Hey, no, Mom,
she is really private, okay?

989
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,061
That's... can Anya not do that?

990
00:49:58,094 --> 00:49:59,362
Can she just wait
until I get home?

991
00:49:59,394 --> 00:50:01,297
I think she's there already
maybe,

992
00:50:01,329 --> 00:50:03,032
but I know she tried
to call you,

993
00:50:03,065 --> 00:50:05,868
so don't worry about it.

994
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:07,403
<i>Everything is gonna be fine.</i>

995
00:50:07,436 --> 00:50:08,837
<i>Um, all right.</i>

996
00:50:08,871 --> 00:50:09,939
<i>Okay, I love you.</i>

997
00:50:09,972 --> 00:50:11,174
<i>Take care of each other.</i>

998
00:50:11,206 --> 00:50:13,175
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

999
00:50:15,344 --> 00:50:19,715
Am I the sad old lady
you take care of?

1000
00:50:22,217 --> 00:50:24,788
How sweet.

1001
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,356
(intense music)

1002
00:50:31,793 --> 00:50:32,761
Why are we stopping?

1003
00:50:32,795 --> 00:50:35,132
I got to get something.

1004
00:50:48,978 --> 00:50:51,715
(music stops)

1005
00:50:53,014 --> 00:50:54,516
- What are you doing?
- Uh, nothing.

1006
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:57,620
Just hold on one minute.

1007
00:50:57,652 --> 00:51:00,189
(clicking)

1008
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:03,459
- Who are you writing?
- No one.

1009
00:51:03,492 --> 00:51:05,527
Can you just please
give me a minute?

1010
00:51:05,561 --> 00:51:08,731
The only thing you should be
focusing on right now is me.

1011
00:51:08,764 --> 00:51:11,000
Anything else can wait.

1012
00:51:11,032 --> 00:51:12,367
Okay, here's what I don't get.

1013
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,869
Why aren't you just going
to someone

1014
00:51:13,902 --> 00:51:15,270
who can help you die?

1015
00:51:15,304 --> 00:51:17,574
I mean, they have
assisted suicides, right?

1016
00:51:17,606 --> 00:51:22,077
I told you, I am not dying
in the hospital.

1017
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:23,779
- Yeah.
- I am dying

1018
00:51:23,813 --> 00:51:25,414
in the lavender farm.

1019
00:51:25,447 --> 00:51:27,549
All I'm saying
is that the drugs exist.

1020
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:28,851
Not around here they don't.

1021
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:31,121
Um, Oregon.

1022
00:51:31,153 --> 00:51:34,423
You want to take a side trip
to Oregon?

1023
00:51:37,626 --> 00:51:38,827
- Canada!
- What?

1024
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,762
Yeah, Canada.

1025
00:51:40,795 --> 00:51:42,965
Canada. I could steal them
for you.

1026
00:51:42,998 --> 00:51:45,634
And how do you propose
to get us into Canada

1027
00:51:45,668 --> 00:51:48,271
without passports?

1028
00:51:48,304 --> 00:51:49,639
I'm not.

1029
00:51:49,672 --> 00:51:51,673
I'm not proposing that...

1030
00:51:51,706 --> 00:51:52,975
Look, you know what?

1031
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:54,476
We don't even need
to steal them.

1032
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:56,412
I don't even need to steal them
because I know a guy

1033
00:51:56,445 --> 00:51:57,780
and he's...

1034
00:51:57,813 --> 00:51:59,215
He's in Canada,
but I know him

1035
00:51:59,248 --> 00:52:00,782
because I've gotten stuff
from him before

1036
00:52:00,815 --> 00:52:03,352
and he could just, like,
meet us at the border

1037
00:52:03,385 --> 00:52:07,990
and get us the drugs,
so that's just...

1038
00:52:08,023 --> 00:52:11,494
God, I mean,
that's a great plan, right?

1039
00:52:16,932 --> 00:52:18,902
Okay.

1040
00:52:18,934 --> 00:52:20,969
Fine.

1041
00:52:21,003 --> 00:52:23,273
Call your guy.

1042
00:52:29,744 --> 00:52:32,281
(clicking, whooshing)

1043
00:52:38,621 --> 00:52:41,157
All right, I just texted him.

1044
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:47,396
(dinging)

1045
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:54,871
That's him.

1046
00:52:54,903 --> 00:52:57,172
We're all good.

1047
00:52:57,206 --> 00:52:59,009
Good.

1048
00:53:04,847 --> 00:53:07,317
What are you waiting for?

1049
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:09,286
(sighing)

1050
00:53:10,286 --> 00:53:13,255
Okay, here's the deal.

1051
00:53:13,289 --> 00:53:16,526
I will get those drugs for you,
I promise, okay?

1052
00:53:19,161 --> 00:53:20,329
We have to drive
through Midland...

1053
00:53:20,362 --> 00:53:21,931
- No, no.
- ...and see your son.

1054
00:53:21,963 --> 00:53:22,965
- I already said no.
- We have to.

1055
00:53:22,998 --> 00:53:24,067
Come on, and then
we could just like

1056
00:53:24,099 --> 00:53:25,134
- jump over to Canada.
- No!

1057
00:53:25,166 --> 00:53:26,835
It is basically on the way.

1058
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:29,239
Do not ask me again.

1059
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:38,780
Look, I don't wanna
have to play this card,

1060
00:53:38,813 --> 00:53:41,317
okay, but you need me.

1061
00:53:45,353 --> 00:53:46,922
Please?

1062
00:53:55,364 --> 00:53:58,668
<i>And I won't back down
to my father's call.</i>

1063
00:53:58,701 --> 00:54:01,704
<i>Wolves in the valley,
and the furnace on.</i>

1064
00:54:01,737 --> 00:54:04,740
<i>I know...</i>

1065
00:54:04,773 --> 00:54:08,644
<i>I know.</i>

1066
00:54:08,677 --> 00:54:11,213
(vocalizing)

1067
00:54:42,744 --> 00:54:45,281
(breathing heavily)

1068
00:54:48,851 --> 00:54:51,387
(knocking)

1069
00:54:55,557 --> 00:54:56,693
Can I help you?

1070
00:54:58,827 --> 00:55:00,096
Are you Sarah?

1071
00:55:00,128 --> 00:55:02,531
I'm Mrs. Magnus, who are you?

1072
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:04,567
I'm Eleanor,

1073
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:07,536
Henry's mother.

1074
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:09,706
Oh.

1075
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:13,009
Does Henry know
you're here... Henry?

1076
00:55:27,255 --> 00:55:29,326
What are you doing here?

1077
00:55:31,927 --> 00:55:34,064
I came to say goodbye.

1078
00:55:38,567 --> 00:55:39,702
Goodbye.

1079
00:56:00,021 --> 00:56:03,092
What... come on.

1080
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:05,927
(car door closes)

1081
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,696
What happened?

1082
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:10,666
Exactly what
I said would happen.

1083
00:56:10,699 --> 00:56:12,902
Now I've done what you've asked.

1084
00:56:12,934 --> 00:56:14,269
What?

1085
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:19,842
No, no, no.

1086
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:21,143
No, no, no, no, no.

1087
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:23,211
Nope, that's not happening.

1088
00:56:23,244 --> 00:56:24,045
No, no, no.

1089
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:26,615
(knocking)

1090
00:56:31,253 --> 00:56:32,255
Who are you?

1091
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:35,690
Uh, I'm a friend of your Mom's.

1092
00:56:35,724 --> 00:56:37,327
Okay, what do you want?

1093
00:56:39,795 --> 00:56:41,130
Um.

1094
00:56:44,266 --> 00:56:46,536
She's dying.

1095
00:56:46,568 --> 00:56:48,036
Hmm.

1096
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:52,408
And she wants to die
even faster than she's dying,

1097
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,943
and that is really fast.

1098
00:56:54,976 --> 00:56:56,512
I understand.

1099
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:01,284
I thought that...

1100
00:57:03,485 --> 00:57:05,855
...that if I got her here
that you could stop her,

1101
00:57:05,887 --> 00:57:08,290
or that you could
help her, or that...

1102
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:09,692
that you'd just know what to do.

1103
00:57:09,724 --> 00:57:12,894
Hmm, all I can do,
all anyone can do

1104
00:57:12,927 --> 00:57:15,630
is pray for her.

1105
00:57:15,664 --> 00:57:17,834
- Wait, no, no, no.
- No, look.

1106
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,735
I did my part.

1107
00:57:19,768 --> 00:57:20,903
I found her a home.

1108
00:57:20,936 --> 00:57:23,840
Um, that place that you
put her, that's not a home.

1109
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:25,775
If she would rather
die on the streets,

1110
00:57:25,807 --> 00:57:27,943
that's her prerogative.

1111
00:57:27,976 --> 00:57:31,379
How can you...

1112
00:57:31,413 --> 00:57:33,583
I mean, she's your mom!

1113
00:57:36,284 --> 00:57:39,020
My mom died
nearly six months ago,

1114
00:57:39,054 --> 00:57:43,759
and her name was Karen.

1115
00:57:43,791 --> 00:57:44,693
My father married her

1116
00:57:44,726 --> 00:57:49,264
when my biological mother
abandoned me.

1117
00:57:49,297 --> 00:57:50,932
She what?

1118
00:57:50,965 --> 00:57:52,768
She made her choice,

1119
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:56,405
and I have been living
with it my whole life.

1120
00:57:58,106 --> 00:58:01,878
She has to live with it now.

1121
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:04,347
Now please get off my property.

1122
00:58:07,081 --> 00:58:09,618
(door closes)

1123
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:12,822
(drumroll)

1124
00:58:34,376 --> 00:58:37,013
Canada, here we come.

1125
00:58:37,045 --> 00:58:39,581
(uneasy music)

1126
00:59:12,914 --> 00:59:15,451
(wind chimes ringing)

1127
00:59:25,293 --> 00:59:27,829
(car engine humming)

1128
00:59:31,266 --> 00:59:33,802
(engine clunking)

1129
00:59:34,869 --> 00:59:35,670
Oh, shit.

1130
00:59:35,704 --> 00:59:36,472
- What?
- Oh!

1131
00:59:36,505 --> 00:59:37,539
I think we're, like, out of,

1132
00:59:37,572 --> 00:59:40,442
- out of gas.
- You've got what?

1133
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:42,912
Oh, no, oh, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit.

1134
00:59:42,945 --> 00:59:47,650
- You're... you're outta gas?
- I mean, I don't... I have, like...

1135
00:59:47,682 --> 00:59:51,119
- You ran outta gas.
- Shit!

1136
00:59:51,152 --> 00:59:53,722
- How did ya let that happen?
- I didn't let...

1137
00:59:53,755 --> 00:59:55,156
My car stopped working, okay?

1138
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:56,992
I mean, usually there's, like,
this little light that comes on

1139
00:59:57,025 --> 00:59:58,159
that tells me that
it's getting low,

1140
00:59:58,193 --> 01:00:00,363
but it didn't,
or, like, I didn't see it.

1141
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:01,731
You didn't see it.

1142
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,599
No.

1143
01:00:03,632 --> 01:00:06,302
Great, that's just great.

1144
01:00:06,335 --> 01:00:08,871
(railway crossing
bells dinging)

1145
01:00:09,871 --> 01:00:12,407
(train horn blaring)

1146
01:00:29,891 --> 01:00:32,427
(phone ringing)

1147
01:00:35,063 --> 01:00:37,599
(drumroll)

1148
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:45,441
(phone ringing)

1149
01:00:45,474 --> 01:00:47,476
Hey, oh, dude,
where have you been?

1150
01:00:47,509 --> 01:00:49,445
- I'm dying over here.
- Sorry, my bad.

1151
01:00:49,478 --> 01:00:51,380
- Shit's been busy.
- I don't, I don't give a fuck.

1152
01:00:51,413 --> 01:00:52,548
I just need to know
if you know anybody

1153
01:00:52,581 --> 01:00:54,583
in eastern fucking Michigan.

1154
01:00:54,615 --> 01:00:55,751
No, I don't.

1155
01:00:55,784 --> 01:00:59,889
Fuck, fuck, okay, uh, all right,
well, what are you up to?

1156
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:02,124
Can you come, like,
I mean, I don't give a fuck.

1157
01:01:02,157 --> 01:01:03,292
I will, I will do anything.

1158
01:01:03,324 --> 01:01:04,059
I will pay you double.

1159
01:01:04,092 --> 01:01:05,460
I don't care, you tell me.

1160
01:01:05,494 --> 01:01:07,262
Dude, what?

1161
01:01:07,295 --> 01:01:09,297
No.

1162
01:01:09,331 --> 01:01:10,666
Matt?

1163
01:01:13,235 --> 01:01:14,570
Fuck!

1164
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:23,012
What?

1165
01:01:24,378 --> 01:01:26,915
(upbeat music)

1166
01:01:36,824 --> 01:01:39,194
(horn honks)

1167
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:41,764
(upbeat music)

1168
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:48,104
Come on before he
takes off, come on.

1169
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:49,105
Do you know him?

1170
01:01:49,137 --> 01:01:50,706
How would I know him?

1171
01:01:50,739 --> 01:01:53,842
You want us to get into a semi
with a complete stranger?

1172
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,611
Uh, maybe he's a psycho killer,

1173
01:01:55,643 --> 01:01:58,346
and he'll solve our problem
for us, now come on.

1174
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,015
Ah, what a bad idea.

1175
01:02:00,047 --> 01:02:02,717
You are the hardest person
to help, come on, this way.

1176
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:05,454
He's this way.

1177
01:02:05,487 --> 01:02:08,023
(coughing)

1178
01:02:09,324 --> 01:02:11,827
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1179
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:14,396
(truck beeping)

1180
01:02:20,469 --> 01:02:23,539
- Uh, hi.
- Hey, hi, hi.

1181
01:02:23,572 --> 01:02:25,840
Um, our car ran outta gas.

1182
01:02:25,873 --> 01:02:26,808
Oh, shit.

1183
01:02:26,842 --> 01:02:30,311
Yeah, I know,
so we need a gas can.

1184
01:02:30,344 --> 01:02:32,480
And some gas.

1185
01:02:32,514 --> 01:02:34,517
Yeah, both would be good.

1186
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:36,818
I've got a gas can.

1187
01:02:36,851 --> 01:02:39,187
- Really?
- Yeah, where's your car?

1188
01:02:39,221 --> 01:02:40,722
Oh, it's just,
like, a couple miles,

1189
01:02:40,755 --> 01:02:42,090
like, up that way.

1190
01:02:42,123 --> 01:02:45,226
Oh, that's easy,
I can give you guys a lift.

1191
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:46,762
Wow, thanks, um,

1192
01:02:46,795 --> 01:02:49,532
all right, just the gas then.

1193
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:52,101
(phone ringing)

1194
01:02:57,972 --> 01:02:59,407
Here ya go.

1195
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:00,542
Thanks.

1196
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:03,144
So, uh, where you two headed?

1197
01:03:03,177 --> 01:03:06,347
We're, uh, headed to
the Upper Peninsula, actually,

1198
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:08,183
but sort of by way of Canada.

1199
01:03:08,217 --> 01:03:10,719
Whew, that is a long drive.

1200
01:03:10,751 --> 01:03:12,855
What's up in Canada?

1201
01:03:12,887 --> 01:03:14,322
Death.

1202
01:03:14,356 --> 01:03:18,093
Is that some kind of online
thing that I don't know about?

1203
01:03:18,126 --> 01:03:21,163
No, just death.

1204
01:03:21,195 --> 01:03:22,498
Like, death, death?

1205
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:25,034
Yeah, death, death.

1206
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,036
Whose death?

1207
01:03:27,068 --> 01:03:28,538
My death.

1208
01:03:31,172 --> 01:03:33,742
Oh, your death.

1209
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:38,047
Hey, so, uh,
pump nine is good to go.

1210
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:40,181
- Do you, uh, want me to...
- Yeah, yeah, that'd be great

1211
01:03:40,215 --> 01:03:41,150
so I don't soak us all

1212
01:03:41,182 --> 01:03:43,585
- with gasoline.
- Yeah.

1213
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:44,954
Although.

1214
01:03:47,956 --> 01:03:50,693
(railway crossing
bells dinging)

1215
01:03:54,695 --> 01:03:57,232
(coughing)

1216
01:03:58,532 --> 01:04:00,435
Thank you again so much.

1217
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:02,637
My pleasure.
It was nothing.

1218
01:04:04,873 --> 01:04:07,842
Eleanor.

1219
01:04:07,876 --> 01:04:10,778
My mom died about
three years ago.

1220
01:04:10,811 --> 01:04:14,516
We all knew it was coming, but...

1221
01:04:14,548 --> 01:04:17,085
She was a lot like you.

1222
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:21,457
She was ready, unafraid,

1223
01:04:21,489 --> 01:04:22,991
and I was lucky enough

1224
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:25,927
to be there
when she crossed over.

1225
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,596
It was one of the true
miracles of my life

1226
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:31,166
being with her in that moment.

1227
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:33,135
You know, I think,

1228
01:04:33,168 --> 01:04:35,237
I think the way we die

1229
01:04:35,269 --> 01:04:38,673
is just as important
as how we live.

1230
01:04:38,706 --> 01:04:42,243
(gentle music)

1231
01:04:42,277 --> 01:04:46,048
And you have to promise me
to stay strong for her.

1232
01:04:46,081 --> 01:04:50,286
We need to give our
loved ones permission to go.

1233
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:52,487
They stick around for us,

1234
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:56,659
so you just have to tell her
everything's gonna be okay.

1235
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:58,193
I'll take that.

1236
01:04:58,226 --> 01:05:00,596
(train horn blaring)

1237
01:05:00,628 --> 01:05:03,197
(railway crossing
bells dinging)

1238
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,768
(gentle music)

1239
01:05:20,681 --> 01:05:23,218
(coughing)

1240
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:27,956
(phone ringing)

1241
01:05:38,532 --> 01:05:40,368
Hey, listen,
I think that we should,

1242
01:05:40,402 --> 01:05:42,838
uh, get a place for the night

1243
01:05:42,871 --> 01:05:44,639
'cause, you know,
it's just late,

1244
01:05:44,672 --> 01:05:47,175
and, um, we're not gonna get
all the way to the farm tonight.

1245
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:49,544
Like, we can't, so I
just think that we should

1246
01:05:49,577 --> 01:05:50,579
get some sleep, you know?

1247
01:05:50,612 --> 01:05:53,782
Get the drugs in the morning.

1248
01:05:53,815 --> 01:05:56,251
Well, if you think we should.

1249
01:05:56,284 --> 01:05:58,820
(coughing)

1250
01:05:59,721 --> 01:06:01,090
Yeah, I do.

1251
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,097
We need a room.

1252
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:10,565
Fantasy suite?

1253
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:12,334
No, just, like, a regular room.

1254
01:06:12,367 --> 01:06:15,204
All our rooms
are fantasy suites.

1255
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:18,474
Okay, yeah, then,
yes fantasy suite.

1256
01:06:18,507 --> 01:06:20,976
$67.84 with tax.

1257
01:06:23,677 --> 01:06:27,181
Okay, Martina, you got ID?

1258
01:06:27,215 --> 01:06:30,653
- I don't, I...
- We have cash.

1259
01:06:35,222 --> 01:06:37,192
That's $80.

1260
01:06:37,224 --> 01:06:40,128
20, 40, 60, 80.

1261
01:06:42,396 --> 01:06:44,799
Ya got five, ya got ten,

1262
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:50,106
- eleven, twelve, and sixteen.
- That's right, thank you.

1263
01:07:00,648 --> 01:07:03,217
(car alarm blaring)

1264
01:07:03,251 --> 01:07:05,788
(faucet running)

1265
01:07:13,661 --> 01:07:16,197
(door closes)

1266
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:23,005
(breathing heavily)

1267
01:07:24,572 --> 01:07:27,643
You're trying to get us caught.

1268
01:07:27,675 --> 01:07:30,211
(drumroll)

1269
01:07:36,684 --> 01:07:39,387
She can trace us
through that card.

1270
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:44,926
They can find us
if you use the card.

1271
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,795
Oh, my God.

1272
01:07:46,827 --> 01:07:49,731
You are so paranoid
it's ridiculous.

1273
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,135
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1274
01:07:59,807 --> 01:08:04,445
There is no going
to Canada, is there?

1275
01:08:04,478 --> 01:08:05,847
Is there?

1276
01:08:08,182 --> 01:08:11,119
Okay, so.

1277
01:08:11,152 --> 01:08:14,422
What's gonna happen to me?

1278
01:08:14,456 --> 01:08:16,592
You just gonna...

1279
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:18,527
abandon me?

1280
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:23,664
Just one more thing
you didn't follow through with?

1281
01:08:23,698 --> 01:08:26,902
One more big lie?

1282
01:08:26,935 --> 01:08:29,472
(phone ringing)

1283
01:08:34,576 --> 01:08:36,177
God, leave me the fuck alone!

1284
01:08:36,211 --> 01:08:38,780
- Who can blame 'em?
- Oh, don't, don't,

1285
01:08:38,813 --> 01:08:41,083
don't, don't.

1286
01:08:41,115 --> 01:08:44,118
You have no idea how fucked up
everything is right now.

1287
01:08:44,152 --> 01:08:45,554
Okay?

1288
01:08:45,587 --> 01:08:48,957
Oh, you poor little thing.

1289
01:08:48,989 --> 01:08:50,725
You really wanna
antagonize me right now?

1290
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:52,528
- Yes, I do, yes, I do.
- Is that what you wanna do?

1291
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,295
- Really, why?
- Yes!

1292
01:08:54,328 --> 01:08:56,631
Because I am so

1293
01:08:56,664 --> 01:08:59,268
- angry at you.
- At me?

1294
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,904
I am risking everything for you.

1295
01:09:03,537 --> 01:09:05,273
I mean, if this goes bad,

1296
01:09:05,306 --> 01:09:08,644
my family will
literally cut me off.

1297
01:09:08,676 --> 01:09:10,311
And, like, that matters to me!

1298
01:09:10,345 --> 01:09:13,215
Like, you could give
a fuck about your family.

1299
01:09:13,247 --> 01:09:15,416
You don't know anything
about me and my family.

1300
01:09:15,449 --> 01:09:19,453
Except that you
walked out on them.

1301
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:22,123
Get out!

1302
01:09:22,157 --> 01:09:24,393
Get out!

1303
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:26,428
Get the fuck outta here!

1304
01:09:26,461 --> 01:09:27,596
Fine.

1305
01:09:30,765 --> 01:09:33,302
(door slams)

1306
01:09:37,238 --> 01:09:38,373
Fuck.

1307
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:43,579
Fuck!

1308
01:09:51,819 --> 01:09:54,355
(phone dinging)

1309
01:09:55,023 --> 01:09:57,560
(drumroll)

1310
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:09,136
<i>Natalie, it's Mom.</i>

1311
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:10,538
<i>I don't know, I just
thought maybe if I called</i>

1312
01:10:10,572 --> 01:10:13,742
<i>on Dad's phone you'd answer,</i>

1313
01:10:13,774 --> 01:10:15,943
<i>but I don't know
what's going on.</i>

1314
01:10:15,976 --> 01:10:17,011
<i>I don't know where you are.</i>

1315
01:10:17,045 --> 01:10:18,279
<i>I don't know...</i>

1316
01:10:18,313 --> 01:10:20,315
<i>I feel like such a fool.</i>

1317
01:10:20,347 --> 01:10:23,252
<i>No one in that nursing home's
ever heard of you.</i>

1318
01:10:23,284 --> 01:10:25,953
<i>God, I have tried so hard,
but this is it.</i>

1319
01:10:25,987 --> 01:10:27,189
<i>I'm, I'm, I give up.</i>

1320
01:10:27,221 --> 01:10:30,992
<i>I never thought I'd say that,
but I just...</i>

1321
01:10:31,025 --> 01:10:33,394
<i>I won't do this anymore.</i>

1322
01:10:33,427 --> 01:10:35,796
<i>I love you, Natalie,
I'll always love you.</i>

1323
01:10:35,829 --> 01:10:39,033
<i>And I have to...
I'm gonna say goodbye to you.</i>

1324
01:10:39,067 --> 01:10:41,470
<i>But you need to fix yourself.</i>

1325
01:10:41,502 --> 01:10:43,838
<i>And until you do,</i>

1326
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:47,175
<i>I won't be a part of your life.</i>

1327
01:10:47,207 --> 01:10:49,944
(intense drumming)

1328
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:01,557
(car speeding)

1329
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:13,702
(mellow music)

1330
01:11:17,471 --> 01:11:23,978
<i>I spend days in a haze</i>

1331
01:11:25,979 --> 01:11:28,949
<i>cryin' over you, babe.</i>

1332
01:11:28,983 --> 01:11:31,420
<i>Well, those days are gone.</i>

1333
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:37,192
<i>I hope you know
I ain't lonesome no more.</i>

1334
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:44,600
<i>I spend nights wronging rights</i>

1335
01:11:47,601 --> 01:11:50,404
<i>without you by my side.</i>

1336
01:11:50,438 --> 01:11:55,077
<i>So if you stay,
I hope you know</i>

1337
01:11:55,109 --> 01:11:59,414
<i>I ain't lonesome no more.</i>

1338
01:12:01,582 --> 01:12:07,321
<i>Well, I know I'm hasty,
but time is wasting.</i>

1339
01:12:07,354 --> 01:12:11,592
<i>Baby, I've gotta know.</i>

1340
01:12:11,626 --> 01:12:14,730
<i>Oh, if you hear
what I'm sayin',</i>

1341
01:12:14,762 --> 01:12:21,336
<i>'cause darlin' I'll be waitin'
with no tears on the floor.</i>

1342
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:28,643
<i>If you hear, hold me close</i>

1343
01:12:28,676 --> 01:12:33,782
<i>like the way you did
when I was low.</i>

1344
01:12:33,814 --> 01:12:36,283
<i>At least I'll know</i>

1345
01:12:36,317 --> 01:12:42,657
<i>that I ain't lonesome,
lonesome no more.</i>

1346
01:12:42,689 --> 01:12:45,226
(mellow music)

1347
01:13:05,078 --> 01:13:07,615
(energetic music)

1348
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:11,520
<i>These eyes ain't no fool.</i>

1349
01:13:11,552 --> 01:13:14,823
<i>What you do,
I see right through.</i>

1350
01:13:14,855 --> 01:13:17,992
<i>Heart shinin' so
pretty when broken.</i>

1351
01:13:18,025 --> 01:13:21,162
<i>On edge, don't come any closer.</i>

1352
01:13:21,195 --> 01:13:24,131
<i>Call me alley cat,
you wanna take home.</i>

1353
01:13:24,164 --> 01:13:27,101
<i>Make my day, fill up my bowl.</i>

1354
01:13:27,135 --> 01:13:30,204
<i>I'm a bad dog you wanna own.</i>

1355
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:33,642
<i>Everyone asks you
where I bury my bones.</i>

1356
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:36,445
<i>Grip, grip,
I've got you in my grip.</i>

1357
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:40,047
<i>Oh, la la,
now I've gone too far.</i>

1358
01:13:40,081 --> 01:13:42,650
<i>Hey, hey, now
I've got your picture.</i>

1359
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:45,787
<i>Oh, la la,
now I've gone too far.</i>

1360
01:13:45,819 --> 01:13:49,523
<i>Oh, la la, now
I've gone too far.</i>

1361
01:13:49,556 --> 01:13:51,693
Hey.

1362
01:13:51,725 --> 01:13:52,527
It's you, right?

1363
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:53,929
This is crazy,
I thought you guys

1364
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:55,363
- would be long gone by now.
- Oh, yeah, no,

1365
01:13:55,395 --> 01:13:56,931
we decided to get a place
for the night,

1366
01:13:56,965 --> 01:13:57,833
- so.
- Oh, that's cool,

1367
01:13:57,865 --> 01:13:59,134
that's very cool.

1368
01:13:59,167 --> 01:14:02,370
It's kinda cool.

1369
01:14:02,403 --> 01:14:03,438
What are you drinkin'?

1370
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:06,207
Oh, PBR.

1371
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,908
Do you want one?

1372
01:14:07,942 --> 01:14:10,244
(upbeat music)

1373
01:14:10,278 --> 01:14:12,815
(breathing heavily)

1374
01:14:45,345 --> 01:14:46,947
<i>You're in the spotlight.</i>

1375
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:48,617
<i>The night is ageless.</i>

1376
01:14:48,649 --> 01:14:49,784
So...

1377
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:53,654
what's your thing?

1378
01:14:53,688 --> 01:14:54,489
My thing,

1379
01:14:54,521 --> 01:14:56,557
- like?
- Like, I know you work

1380
01:14:56,591 --> 01:15:00,228
- at a gas station.
- Kinda, only on the weekends.

1381
01:15:00,261 --> 01:15:03,532
Okay, wait, oh my...

1382
01:15:03,564 --> 01:15:05,000
Please tell me
you're not in high school.

1383
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:08,503
No, no, no, no,
I'm in college, I'm 21, I'm 21.

1384
01:15:08,536 --> 01:15:11,105
Okay, 21 is, like, slightly
better than high school,

1385
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:12,106
but at least, you know,

1386
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:14,042
flirting with you
is not illegal.

1387
01:15:14,074 --> 01:15:16,778
So, cheers to that.

1388
01:15:18,579 --> 01:15:22,350
You're flirting with me?

1389
01:15:22,382 --> 01:15:23,318
Apparently not very well

1390
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:27,054
- if you have to ask.
- No, no, sorry, I just...

1391
01:15:27,087 --> 01:15:27,855
Cool.

1392
01:15:27,889 --> 01:15:29,224
Cool.

1393
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:51,747
(energetic music)

1394
01:15:55,216 --> 01:15:56,451
Okay.

1395
01:15:56,484 --> 01:15:58,219
Tryin' it again.

1396
01:15:58,252 --> 01:16:00,121
- What's your thing?
- I don't know, I guess I'm,

1397
01:16:00,154 --> 01:16:01,890
I'm just tryin' to...
I guess the thing is, like,

1398
01:16:01,922 --> 01:16:04,358
- I just wanna get outta here.
- You wanna get outta here, okay.

1399
01:16:04,391 --> 01:16:06,427
I really want to, but...

1400
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:08,029
no, I just need to save money.

1401
01:16:08,061 --> 01:16:09,029
I just need to save up,

1402
01:16:09,063 --> 01:16:10,798
and make sure that I can,
like, stay afloat,

1403
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:14,302
and, you know, not end up
falling back over here.

1404
01:16:14,335 --> 01:16:15,671
Yeah.

1405
01:16:17,337 --> 01:16:19,239
What about you,
what's your thing?

1406
01:16:19,273 --> 01:16:21,810
(energetic music)

1407
01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:24,813
I'm a dancer.

1408
01:16:24,845 --> 01:16:27,214
- No way!
- Yeah.

1409
01:16:27,247 --> 01:16:29,951
Like, like a pole dancer?

1410
01:16:29,984 --> 01:16:31,953
No, no!

1411
01:16:31,985 --> 01:16:33,654
Not a pole dancer.

1412
01:16:33,688 --> 01:16:35,023
Well, I shouldn't
say it like that.

1413
01:16:35,055 --> 01:16:38,726
I mean, not professionally,
not a professional pole dancer.

1414
01:16:40,595 --> 01:16:44,065
No, I do modern dance
with this company in New York.

1415
01:16:44,097 --> 01:16:45,332
That's where I live.

1416
01:16:45,365 --> 01:16:47,502
- That is so fuckin' cool.
- Yeah.

1417
01:16:47,534 --> 01:16:50,238
Is it just like, you know,
like in the movies or TV?

1418
01:16:50,270 --> 01:16:53,707
It is the shittiest
place on Earth.

1419
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:56,444
But I am madly in love with it.

1420
01:16:58,512 --> 01:17:01,048
(breathing heavily)

1421
01:17:12,092 --> 01:17:14,461
(groaning)

1422
01:17:14,494 --> 01:17:17,064
(tense music)

1423
01:17:17,097 --> 01:17:19,635
(door handle jiggling)

1424
01:17:21,569 --> 01:17:24,139
(thumping on door)

1425
01:17:24,171 --> 01:17:26,707
(tense music)

1426
01:17:38,653 --> 01:17:43,158
So do you have
anything stronger?

1427
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:45,659
- Like, what?
- Like,

1428
01:17:45,693 --> 01:17:48,563
I don't... like, anything really.

1429
01:17:48,595 --> 01:17:50,364
I mean, I don't
really do that much.

1430
01:17:50,398 --> 01:17:53,435
Like, I'm not that into, like,
coke, coke, or E, or...

1431
01:17:53,467 --> 01:17:55,603
No, no, I know
that shit's disgusting.

1432
01:17:55,636 --> 01:17:58,773
I just, I mean more like, um,

1433
01:17:58,805 --> 01:18:03,143
painkillers,
or like, pills, like Xanax.

1434
01:18:03,176 --> 01:18:04,778
Yeah, actually, my Dad

1435
01:18:04,811 --> 01:18:07,481
he had this
surgery for his knee,

1436
01:18:07,515 --> 01:18:09,484
and they gave him
something for the pain,

1437
01:18:09,516 --> 01:18:14,354
and he didn't
take any of it, so...

1438
01:18:14,387 --> 01:18:15,756
I don't know, I mean,

1439
01:18:15,789 --> 01:18:19,760
I don't know if you wanted
to come back home with me.

1440
01:18:19,793 --> 01:18:22,529
<i>Gettin' high just
to live for the weekend.</i>

1441
01:18:22,563 --> 01:18:24,265
<i>See me live, baby.</i>

1442
01:18:24,297 --> 01:18:28,103
<i>I know what you're thinkin'.</i>

1443
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:29,170
Sure.

1444
01:18:29,203 --> 01:18:32,607
<i>Knockin' at your door.</i>

1445
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,042
<i>You want a winner.</i>

1446
01:18:34,074 --> 01:18:35,309
<i>Well, I'm a winner.</i>

1447
01:18:35,342 --> 01:18:39,514
<i>When you think you know,
you ain't never gonna get her.</i>

1448
01:18:39,546 --> 01:18:44,551
<i>Oh, playin' in your walls.</i>

1449
01:18:44,585 --> 01:18:45,854
Wait a minute,
what about the pills?

1450
01:18:45,886 --> 01:18:47,188
I'll get 'em after,
I'll get 'em after.

1451
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:48,689
Get 'em now,
get 'em now, get 'em now.

1452
01:18:48,722 --> 01:18:49,690
Get 'em now.

1453
01:18:49,724 --> 01:18:52,193
I'll be so much better,
trust me.

1454
01:18:52,225 --> 01:18:54,561
Trust me, okay?

1455
01:18:54,595 --> 01:18:56,530
<i>You want a winner.</i>

1456
01:18:56,564 --> 01:18:58,867
- Okay.
- <i>When you think you know</i>

1457
01:18:58,899 --> 01:19:01,469
<i>you ain't ever gonna get her.</i>

1458
01:19:06,673 --> 01:19:09,511
- Hey, hey.
- I got something.

1459
01:19:14,548 --> 01:19:16,050
What, what?

1460
01:19:16,082 --> 01:19:18,519
Wait.

1461
01:19:18,552 --> 01:19:21,890
Let's take a pill together...

1462
01:19:25,091 --> 01:19:27,362
...and make love,
come with me.

1463
01:19:27,395 --> 01:19:28,263
I'm okay.

1464
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:29,731
No, come on,
I want us to experience

1465
01:19:29,764 --> 01:19:31,967
this whole night together.

1466
01:19:36,237 --> 01:19:38,940
Do it, do it.

1467
01:19:38,972 --> 01:19:40,108
Okay.

1468
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:48,716
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

1469
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:56,157
You're great,
come here, come here.

1470
01:19:56,189 --> 01:19:57,658
How 'bout you close
your eyes for a second?

1471
01:19:57,692 --> 01:19:58,458
Close your eyes for a second.

1472
01:19:58,492 --> 01:20:00,094
Close your eyes

1473
01:20:00,127 --> 01:20:02,397
Okay, okay, okay.

1474
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:04,532
- All right.
- Just trust me.

1475
01:20:04,564 --> 01:20:06,701
Trust me, there you go.

1476
01:20:11,238 --> 01:20:14,007
You just gotta
let it kick in, okay?

1477
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:15,177
Okay.

1478
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:24,119
Feels good.

1479
01:20:29,189 --> 01:20:32,827
My mom used to do this
when she tucked me in.

1480
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:42,037
You're a good guy, Dillon.

1481
01:20:44,505 --> 01:20:46,074
You're good.

1482
01:20:53,581 --> 01:20:55,684
No, I'm not.

1483
01:21:02,555 --> 01:21:05,025
Sorry I lied to you.

1484
01:21:09,663 --> 01:21:13,268
I really wanna stop lying.

1485
01:21:13,301 --> 01:21:15,070
It's just...

1486
01:21:18,439 --> 01:21:21,142
I feel so trapped, you know.

1487
01:21:28,983 --> 01:21:31,319
I guess I just need
to wake up tomorrow morning,

1488
01:21:31,351 --> 01:21:33,054
and just...

1489
01:21:35,155 --> 01:21:38,592
...decide I'm not
gonna lie anymore.

1490
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:43,898
If I could just tell
the truth for a whole day.

1491
01:21:49,670 --> 01:21:52,606
Then maybe for a whole week.

1492
01:21:55,643 --> 01:21:57,311
Then maybe for a whole month.

1493
01:21:57,345 --> 01:21:59,847
Maybe for a whole year.

1494
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:07,088
I could do that.

1495
01:22:12,359 --> 01:22:15,729
Yeah, I could do that.

1496
01:22:15,762 --> 01:22:18,300
(bird cawing)

1497
01:22:28,274 --> 01:22:30,811
(groaning)

1498
01:22:31,878 --> 01:22:34,948
What the fuck?

1499
01:22:34,981 --> 01:22:36,117
Oh.

1500
01:22:43,056 --> 01:22:45,393
(retching)

1501
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:04,145
(mellow music)

1502
01:23:27,801 --> 01:23:29,202
<i>Hey, Eleanor?</i>

1503
01:23:29,235 --> 01:23:31,739
(knocking)

1504
01:23:33,073 --> 01:23:34,742
Eleanor?

1505
01:23:40,613 --> 01:23:42,716
Hey, Eleanor?

1506
01:24:21,421 --> 01:24:23,957
(energetic music)

1507
01:24:30,530 --> 01:24:31,865
Hey.

1508
01:24:33,533 --> 01:24:35,036
Hey!

1509
01:24:35,069 --> 01:24:36,938
- Hey!
- What?

1510
01:24:36,970 --> 01:24:38,205
You know that
woman I came in with?

1511
01:24:38,238 --> 01:24:40,740
- Look who's back.
- Do you know where she is?

1512
01:24:40,774 --> 01:24:43,311
(energetic music)

1513
01:24:46,012 --> 01:24:47,715
I am so sorry.

1514
01:24:47,747 --> 01:24:50,650
I'm so sorry to hear that.

1515
01:24:50,684 --> 01:24:52,220
Well, like I said,
I am so sorry to hear that.

1516
01:24:52,252 --> 01:24:55,622
I need to see Eleanor Magnus,
she was admitted last night.

1517
01:24:55,655 --> 01:24:57,591
I'm so sorry.

1518
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:59,961
I really am so...

1519
01:25:02,863 --> 01:25:04,499
Now, how may I help you?

1520
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:05,800
I need to see Eleanor Magnus.

1521
01:25:05,832 --> 01:25:07,268
- Eleanor, okay.
- Okay, I think she had

1522
01:25:07,301 --> 01:25:08,636
- a heart attack.
- Eleanor, you said?

1523
01:25:08,668 --> 01:25:09,670
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

1524
01:25:09,703 --> 01:25:11,539
Uh-huh.

1525
01:25:11,572 --> 01:25:14,609
I don't see a... what was
the last name again?

1526
01:25:14,641 --> 01:25:15,742
- Magnus.
- Magnus.

1527
01:25:15,775 --> 01:25:18,078
- Are you family?
- I...

1528
01:25:19,979 --> 01:25:24,417
- Oh, fuck me.
- I'm sorry?

1529
01:25:24,451 --> 01:25:26,621
Look, I said I wasn't
gonna lie anymore, okay,

1530
01:25:26,654 --> 01:25:27,755
and I'm really trying not to,

1531
01:25:27,787 --> 01:25:31,258
so just please
don't make me lie.

1532
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:33,194
Just ask me something else.

1533
01:25:33,226 --> 01:25:34,694
- I'm sorry, I...
- Please, just anything else.

1534
01:25:34,728 --> 01:25:36,463
- Okay, I don't know...
- Just ask me anything.

1535
01:25:36,497 --> 01:25:38,032
- You can ask me anything else.
- Okay, I'm sorry,

1536
01:25:38,064 --> 01:25:39,132
I'm afraid I don't understand

1537
01:25:39,166 --> 01:25:40,534
- what you're...
- Hey, that... that is Eleanor.

1538
01:25:40,568 --> 01:25:42,970
- Oh, that's Eleanor.
- Yes, that's Eleanor!

1539
01:25:43,002 --> 01:25:44,005
No, we've been
trying to figure out

1540
01:25:44,037 --> 01:25:45,038
- who she is.
- Wait, is she okay?

1541
01:25:45,072 --> 01:25:48,208
Uh, let's get you
checked in, and you are?

1542
01:25:48,242 --> 01:25:49,677
- Natalie.
- Okay.

1543
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:50,744
Grillo.

1544
01:25:50,778 --> 01:25:52,213
- "l-l-o"?
- Yes.

1545
01:25:52,246 --> 01:25:55,949
- And you said Eleanor Magnus?
- Yes.

1546
01:25:55,983 --> 01:25:58,552
Oh, do you have
her Social, off hand?

1547
01:25:58,586 --> 01:25:59,954
No.

1548
01:25:59,987 --> 01:26:02,088
Okay, she have insurance,
Medicaid?

1549
01:26:02,122 --> 01:26:03,490
I honestly don't know.

1550
01:26:03,524 --> 01:26:04,425
Okay.

1551
01:26:04,457 --> 01:26:07,228
Uh, primary residence?

1552
01:26:08,628 --> 01:26:09,963
Um.

1553
01:26:11,698 --> 01:26:13,433
Does she have a residence?

1554
01:26:16,337 --> 01:26:17,805
Not really.

1555
01:26:17,837 --> 01:26:19,472
Is she homeless?

1556
01:26:19,506 --> 01:26:20,675
Yes.

1557
01:26:20,707 --> 01:26:21,741
- Yes!
- Oh.

1558
01:26:21,774 --> 01:26:22,710
That is not a lie.

1559
01:26:22,743 --> 01:26:23,978
Sorry, I didn't mean
to get that excited,

1560
01:26:24,011 --> 01:26:26,581
but no, yes, she's homeless.

1561
01:26:26,613 --> 01:26:30,584
Uh, and your relationship is?

1562
01:26:30,618 --> 01:26:33,221
She's my friend.

1563
01:26:33,253 --> 01:26:34,689
<i>The bad news is
your friend's heart</i>

1564
01:26:34,721 --> 01:26:37,123
<i>is way too weak on its own.</i>

1565
01:26:37,157 --> 01:26:39,393
What we call cardiomyopathy
with a-fib.

1566
01:26:39,426 --> 01:26:41,128
But if she sticks
to a strict protocol,

1567
01:26:41,161 --> 01:26:44,030
she's got a good shot.

1568
01:26:44,064 --> 01:26:46,534
A good shot at what?

1569
01:26:46,567 --> 01:26:48,101
Time.

1570
01:26:48,135 --> 01:26:50,538
That's what it's all about.

1571
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:52,939
Right.

1572
01:26:52,972 --> 01:26:54,574
You can go in there
for a while if you want,

1573
01:26:54,608 --> 01:26:56,010
but let her sleep, okay?

1574
01:26:56,042 --> 01:26:58,045
She needs to rest.

1575
01:27:03,684 --> 01:27:04,418
Hey.

1576
01:27:04,451 --> 01:27:07,954
- Sorry.
- Get the fuck off me.

1577
01:27:07,988 --> 01:27:09,590
Hey, don't go back to sleep.

1578
01:27:09,622 --> 01:27:11,458
Hey, can you just
open your eyes please?

1579
01:27:11,492 --> 01:27:12,627
Come on.

1580
01:27:16,296 --> 01:27:17,464
Hey.

1581
01:27:17,497 --> 01:27:20,033
(machines beeping)

1582
01:27:28,775 --> 01:27:31,511
You're still here.

1583
01:27:31,545 --> 01:27:33,581
I'm just sort of sitting here
trying to figure out

1584
01:27:33,613 --> 01:27:35,915
how I'm gonna break
you out of this place.

1585
01:27:35,948 --> 01:27:38,485
(chuckling)

1586
01:27:45,225 --> 01:27:46,861
I mean, you know, I could
go get a wheelchair,

1587
01:27:46,894 --> 01:27:48,695
and I could just,

1588
01:27:48,729 --> 01:27:49,664
like, strap you into it,

1589
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:53,266
and just, like,
wheel you outta here,

1590
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:55,770
you know, when
they're all distracted.

1591
01:27:55,802 --> 01:28:00,041
I mean, that probably is,
like, the best plan, but...

1592
01:28:01,641 --> 01:28:03,077
...I mean, you know,
I think they have

1593
01:28:03,109 --> 01:28:06,680
cameras and stuff, and so...

1594
01:28:06,713 --> 01:28:09,382
I'm pretty sure
that's kidnapping.

1595
01:28:09,416 --> 01:28:12,386
And then, and then
they'd be looking for me,

1596
01:28:12,418 --> 01:28:13,988
and then they find me,
and then you're dead,

1597
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:15,021
and I think that,

1598
01:28:15,055 --> 01:28:18,826
I think that's
probably murder, so...

1599
01:28:18,859 --> 01:28:21,295
Just sort of, you know,

1600
01:28:21,328 --> 01:28:23,030
going over
everything in my head.

1601
01:28:23,063 --> 01:28:26,000
- Just trying to figure out...
- Stop.

1602
01:28:26,033 --> 01:28:28,569
(machines beeping)

1603
01:28:29,636 --> 01:28:31,339
It's over.

1604
01:28:32,805 --> 01:28:35,643
What are you talking about,
no it's not.

1605
01:28:35,676 --> 01:28:37,678
- It's over
- No, it's not.

1606
01:28:37,711 --> 01:28:39,713
- It is.
- No, it is not.

1607
01:28:39,747 --> 01:28:42,016
Hey, I got the drugs.

1608
01:28:42,048 --> 01:28:43,516
- What?
- Yeah.

1609
01:28:43,550 --> 01:28:45,152
I got the drugs.

1610
01:28:45,185 --> 01:28:46,520
I mean, I didn't,

1611
01:28:46,552 --> 01:28:48,389
I didn't get the drugs... Fuck!

1612
01:28:48,421 --> 01:28:52,225
You know, this telling the truth
thing is so fucking hard.

1613
01:28:55,162 --> 01:28:57,565
I got drugs...

1614
01:29:01,335 --> 01:29:05,872
...and they'll
definitely do the trick.

1615
01:29:05,905 --> 01:29:07,908
So give 'em to me.

1616
01:29:07,940 --> 01:29:09,909
No!

1617
01:29:09,943 --> 01:29:11,712
No, you're not dying in here.

1618
01:29:11,744 --> 01:29:14,681
You're dying
in the lavender farm.

1619
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:28,529
It's where she is, right?

1620
01:29:32,899 --> 01:29:34,501
Ramona?

1621
01:29:41,507 --> 01:29:42,643
Okay.

1622
01:29:44,211 --> 01:29:46,614
Then that's where
you have to be.

1623
01:29:50,884 --> 01:29:53,253
And I have to get you there.

1624
01:29:58,391 --> 01:30:01,128
It's the only thing
in my life...

1625
01:30:04,131 --> 01:30:06,734
...that means anything.

1626
01:30:08,668 --> 01:30:10,470
Just please.

1627
01:30:18,212 --> 01:30:19,580
What are you doing?

1628
01:30:19,613 --> 01:30:21,816
No, please don't call them,
please don't call them.

1629
01:30:21,849 --> 01:30:23,551
I will just sit here,
I won't talk, okay.

1630
01:30:23,583 --> 01:30:25,618
I won't say anything if you
don't want me to bother you.

1631
01:30:25,652 --> 01:30:27,320
I'm just gonna
sit here with you.

1632
01:30:27,354 --> 01:30:29,789
Hi, Eleanor,
do you need something?

1633
01:30:29,823 --> 01:30:32,693
I'd like to check out.

1634
01:30:32,725 --> 01:30:34,661
Oh, God.

1635
01:30:34,694 --> 01:30:36,296
Oh, okay.

1636
01:30:36,329 --> 01:30:38,097
I'll get the doctor.

1637
01:30:38,131 --> 01:30:39,867
They're not gonna
let you just check out.

1638
01:30:39,899 --> 01:30:43,136
It will be all right.

1639
01:30:43,170 --> 01:30:45,271
Fuck.

1640
01:30:45,305 --> 01:30:48,175
You're awake.

1641
01:30:48,207 --> 01:30:51,911
How are you feeling?

1642
01:30:51,944 --> 01:30:53,847
I wanna check out.

1643
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:57,685
That's not advisable,
Ms. Magnus.

1644
01:30:57,717 --> 01:31:00,587
I wanna check out.

1645
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:02,155
Now.

1646
01:31:02,189 --> 01:31:04,592
Wait, you can do that?

1647
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:05,993
Sorry, I'm sorry,
can she do that?

1648
01:31:06,025 --> 01:31:07,327
Of course she can,

1649
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:09,829
but she'd be leaving
against medical advice.

1650
01:31:09,863 --> 01:31:10,731
Ms. Magnus,

1651
01:31:10,764 --> 01:31:12,833
you have a very
serious condition.

1652
01:31:12,865 --> 01:31:15,836
Even with treatment,
it's tenuous,

1653
01:31:15,868 --> 01:31:19,372
and it would be unethical
to allow you to leave.

1654
01:31:19,405 --> 01:31:20,940
But you just said
she doesn't need

1655
01:31:20,974 --> 01:31:24,345
your permission, right?

1656
01:31:24,377 --> 01:31:26,179
You know what,
why don't we go outside,

1657
01:31:26,212 --> 01:31:28,414
and let's let her
get some sleep.

1658
01:31:28,448 --> 01:31:30,718
I don't need sleep.

1659
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:34,288
I need to get
the hell outta here!

1660
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:38,793
You heard her.

1661
01:31:48,135 --> 01:31:51,305
Okay, put your head back.

1662
01:31:51,337 --> 01:31:53,474
Is that comfortable?

1663
01:31:53,506 --> 01:31:55,308
- It's cozy.
- Okay.

1664
01:31:55,341 --> 01:31:56,777
It's good.

1665
01:31:56,810 --> 01:31:58,179
Okay.

1666
01:32:01,213 --> 01:32:02,550
Here.

1667
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:07,454
I can't take it with me.

1668
01:32:10,623 --> 01:32:14,127
Don't spend that on drugs.

1669
01:32:14,161 --> 01:32:16,931
I mean, this wouldn't
buy me even one drug.

1670
01:32:20,233 --> 01:32:21,569
I won't.

1671
01:32:24,738 --> 01:32:27,307
So...

1672
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:29,677
that's...

1673
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:35,416
$60 and 16 cents
you've taken from me.

1674
01:32:35,448 --> 01:32:37,784
That seems right.

1675
01:32:37,818 --> 01:32:40,154
For everything.

1676
01:32:40,186 --> 01:32:41,521
Yeah.

1677
01:32:45,458 --> 01:32:49,729
Hold up, are you saying
that I only stole $50 from you?

1678
01:32:49,762 --> 01:32:52,533
Only?

1679
01:32:52,565 --> 01:32:56,103
This whole thing
started over $50?

1680
01:32:56,136 --> 01:32:59,773
Well, technically,

1681
01:32:59,805 --> 01:33:05,111
this whole thing
is ending over $50.

1682
01:33:05,145 --> 01:33:07,715
(laughing)

1683
01:33:07,747 --> 01:33:10,283
(hopeful music)

1684
01:33:12,019 --> 01:33:13,487
Okay.

1685
01:33:17,990 --> 01:33:20,527
<i>We are glorious, glorious</i>

1686
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,363
<i>like a burnin' red sky.</i>

1687
01:33:22,395 --> 01:33:25,231
<i>And we are champions,
champions.</i>

1688
01:33:25,265 --> 01:33:27,468
<i>We're gonna dance in the sun.</i>

1689
01:33:27,501 --> 01:33:29,737
<i>There are stories of us</i>

1690
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:32,306
<i>about the fire in our eyes</i>

1691
01:33:32,338 --> 01:33:34,541
<i>and the battles we've won.</i>

1692
01:33:34,573 --> 01:33:37,277
<i>We're forever young,
forever young.</i>

1693
01:33:37,310 --> 01:33:41,749
<i>Oh, we are glorious, glorious.</i>

1694
01:33:46,752 --> 01:33:53,426
<i>Oh, we are champions,
champions.</i>

1695
01:34:00,399 --> 01:34:05,538
<i>When we walk into the light,
I can hear the callin',</i>

1696
01:34:05,572 --> 01:34:09,877
<i>and in my heart
it's like a beating drum.</i>

1697
01:34:09,909 --> 01:34:12,412
<i>When there's nothin'
left to fight,</i>

1698
01:34:12,445 --> 01:34:14,814
<i>even if we're fallin',</i>

1699
01:34:14,847 --> 01:34:20,520
<i>jump in yourself,
they've come to take us home.</i>

1700
01:34:22,521 --> 01:34:27,827
<i>We are glorious, glorious.</i>

1701
01:34:27,860 --> 01:34:33,400
<i>Oh, we are champions,
champions.</i>

1702
01:34:36,403 --> 01:34:38,639
<i>Oh, we are young,</i>

1703
01:34:38,671 --> 01:34:41,474
<i>and we are free.</i>

1704
01:34:41,507 --> 01:34:47,014
<i>We are glorious, glorious.</i>

1705
01:34:47,046 --> 01:34:49,015
<i>Glorious!</i>

1706
01:34:49,048 --> 01:34:51,585
(hopeful music)

1707
01:35:06,432 --> 01:35:08,435
Down there.

1708
01:35:12,972 --> 01:35:15,509
(peaceful music)

1709
01:36:50,871 --> 01:36:51,971
Okay.

1710
01:36:52,005 --> 01:36:53,006
All right.

1711
01:36:53,038 --> 01:36:55,408
Okay, hang on.

1712
01:36:55,442 --> 01:36:57,978
(peaceful music)

1713
01:37:13,326 --> 01:37:15,162
You ready?

1714
01:37:15,194 --> 01:37:16,697
Yes.

1715
01:37:16,729 --> 01:37:19,199
(peaceful music)

1716
01:37:30,510 --> 01:37:33,747
I don't know
how long this will take.

1717
01:37:35,849 --> 01:37:38,552
Well, I've got nowhere to be.

1718
01:37:41,121 --> 01:37:42,288
Okay.

1719
01:37:42,322 --> 01:37:44,859
(peaceful music)

1720
01:38:05,211 --> 01:38:07,247
I don't want you to go.

1721

(peaceful music)

1722
01:38:10,082 --> 01:38:12,786
I'm sorry, I know that
that's selfish.

1723
01:38:12,819 --> 01:38:16,723
It's not selfish.

1724
01:38:16,756 --> 01:38:19,393
And you're not a monster.

1725
01:38:19,426 --> 01:38:22,029
(peaceful music)

1726
01:38:26,899 --> 01:38:29,502
- Okay.
- Okay.

1727
01:38:29,536 --> 01:38:32,072
(peaceful music)

1728
01:38:39,945 --> 01:38:41,113
Okay.

1730
01:38:51,291 --> 01:38:52,458
Okay.

(peaceful music)

1732
01:39:36,502 --> 01:39:39,105
It's okay.

1733
01:39:39,139 --> 01:39:40,708
You can go.

1734
01:39:45,878 --> 01:39:48,414

Hey, um, can people get
addicted to getting tattoos?

1741
01:42:26,773 --> 01:42:28,375
Absolutely.

1742
01:42:30,944 --> 01:42:32,012
Shit.

01:43:42,247 --> 01:43:47,086
<i>Oh, the less my choices cost.</i>

1762
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:51,557
<i>Oh, so it ain't no big loss.</i>

1763
01:43:51,591 --> 01:43:57,664
<i>Oh, 'cause I'm livin' like a,
livin' like a boss.</i>

1764
01:43:57,697 --> 01:44:00,234
(upbeat music)

1765
01:44:10,409 --> 01:44:13,613
<i>Let the will to die
I breathed in,</i>

1766
01:44:13,645 --> 01:44:16,382
<i>I think it's poison.</i>

1767
01:44:16,416 --> 01:44:22,087
<i>Let the will to live, yeah,
pass by a door half open.</i>

1768
01:44:22,121 --> 01:44:25,158
<i>A kiss for an extra
handful of almonds,</i>

1769
01:44:25,190 --> 01:44:28,193
<i>all motives to keep me inside.</i>

1770
01:44:28,226 --> 01:44:30,095
<i>Last bit of lavender picked,</i>

1771
01:44:30,128 --> 01:44:31,698
<i>there is nothing,
there's nothing,</i>

1772
01:44:31,730 --> 01:44:33,432
<i>there's nothing,
there's nothing,</i>

1773
01:44:33,466 --> 01:44:35,702
<i>there's nothing to hide.</i>

1774
01:44:35,734 --> 01:44:38,671
<i>Now some pray to the angels,</i>

1775
01:44:38,704 --> 01:44:41,207
<i>our spirit guides our backs.</i>

1776
01:44:41,239 --> 01:44:44,710
<i>We'll do pirouettes
on train tracks</i>

1777
01:44:44,743 --> 01:44:48,081
<i>and laugh ourselves to death.</i>

1778
01:44:48,113 --> 01:44:51,116
<i>Laugh ourselves to death.</i>

1779
01:44:51,149 --> 01:44:52,851
<i>Laugh ourselves to death.</i>

1780
01:44:52,885 --> 01:44:59,192
<i>I think I spend too much time
lost in thinking.</i>

1781
01:44:59,225 --> 01:45:02,295
<i>We're either
running out of time,</i>

1782
01:45:02,328 --> 01:45:04,998
<i>there's only time left.</i>

1783
01:45:05,030 --> 01:45:07,667
<i>On my way out, I made a plan</i>

1784
01:45:07,699 --> 01:45:11,371
<i>to knock all the doors
to say my goodbyes.</i>

1785
01:45:11,404 --> 01:45:13,239
<i>There is nothing,
there's nothing,</i>

1786
01:45:13,271 --> 01:45:14,640
<i>there's nothing,
there's nothing,</i>

1787
01:45:14,673 --> 01:45:16,242
<i>there's nothing,
there's nothing,</i>

1788
01:45:16,274 --> 01:45:18,377
<i>there's nothing to hide.</i>

1789
01:45:18,411 --> 01:45:21,480
<i>While some pray to the angels,</i>

1790
01:45:21,514 --> 01:45:24,250
<i>our spirit guides our backs.</i>

1791
01:45:24,283 --> 01:45:27,820
<i>We'll do pirouettes
on train tracks,</i>

1792
01:45:27,854 --> 01:45:31,091
<i>and laugh ourselves to death.</i>

1793
01:45:31,123 --> 01:45:34,226
<i>Laugh ourselves to death.</i>

1794
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:36,229
<i>Laugh ourselves to death.</i>

1795
01:45:36,261 --> 01:45:39,298
<i>I don't know who
you think I am,</i>

1796
01:45:39,332 --> 01:45:42,335
<i>but nice to meet you.</i>

1797
01:45:42,368 --> 01:45:48,108
<i>I was about to leave,
but now I think I'll stay here.</i>

1798
01:45:48,140 --> 01:45:51,210
<i>Is this a memory
that we are both making?</i>

1799
01:45:51,243 --> 01:45:54,346
<i>These are the measures
we think about taking.</i>

1800
01:45:54,380 --> 01:45:57,217
<i>Now I am sleeping,
so, darling, don't wake me.</i>

1801
01:45:57,250 --> 01:45:58,685
<i>There's nothing,
there's nothing,</i>

1802
01:45:58,717 --> 01:46:01,720
<i>there's nothing,
there's nothing to hide.</i>

1803
01:46:01,753 --> 01:46:04,757
<i>While some pray to the angels,</i>

1804
01:46:04,791 --> 01:46:07,293
<i>our spirit guides our backs.</i>

1805
01:46:07,326 --> 01:46:10,863
<i>We'll do pirouettes
on train tracks,</i>

1806
01:46:10,896 --> 01:46:14,199
<i>and laugh ourselves to death.</i>

1807
01:46:14,233 --> 01:46:16,235
<i>Laugh ourselves to death.</i>
