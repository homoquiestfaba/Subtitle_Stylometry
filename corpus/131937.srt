1
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,700
Hey!

2
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,400
What makes a man?
Is it the power in his hands?

3
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,000
Is his quest for glory?

4
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,100
Give it all you've got
To fight to the top

5
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,000
So we can know your story

6
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,600
Now you're a man
A man, man, man

7
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,200
Now you're a man
A manny, manny, man

8
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,200
A man, man, man

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,700
You are now a man
You're a man

10
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,200
Now you're a man

11
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,500
Live it, live it

12
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,300
What makes a man?
Is it the woman in his arms?

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,200
Just 'cause she has big titties?

14
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,600
Or is it the way he fights every day?

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,200
... No, it's probably the titties

16
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,100
Now you're a man
A man, man, man

17
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,800
Now you're a man-man
Man-man, man, man-man

18
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,200
Now you're a man

19
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,200
M - A - N, man
Man, man-man, man

20
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,900
Now you're a man

21
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,500
Hello there.
My name is Robert White.

22
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,650
And I'm Joseph Young.

23
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,210
And we're with the Church
of Jesus Christ...

24
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,230
... of Latter-Day Saints.

25
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,000
Who?

26
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:36,911
Let me ask you a question.

27
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:40,012
What would you say if someone
offered you peace and happiness...

28
00:02:40,052 --> 00:02:41,092
... through all of eternity?

29
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
Fuck off!

30
00:02:46,454 --> 00:02:48,695
- Thank you!
- Have a nice day!

31
00:02:56,558 --> 00:03:01,299
Oh... Yeah baby! You make me so horny!

32
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:04,980
Oh, I want it so bad! Ohhh...

33
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:10,702
I bet you do.
And I'm gonna give it to you.

34
00:03:10,782 --> 00:03:14,463
Oh, good... 'cause I'm
so badly wanting it.

35
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:24,507
Hi.

36
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:29,508
Thank you.

37
00:03:30,068 --> 00:03:30,948
Buhbye!

38
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:33,929
- ...Almost.
- Mhm.

39
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:39,752
Oh yeah, harder! Oh, yeh!
Oh, give it to me, you big stud!

40
00:03:40,472 --> 00:03:41,392
I'm not a stud.

41
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,200
Huh?

42
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,632
I'm not a stud!

43
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:44,913
I'm...

44
00:03:46,273 --> 00:03:47,874
... Jizzmaster Zero!

45
00:03:48,835 --> 00:03:53,415
- Aagh! Oh no! Help! Somebody help!
- Ain't nobody gonna help you now, honey!

46
00:03:53,655 --> 00:03:55,676
- Will somebody save me??

47
00:03:58,317 --> 00:04:00,158
Orgazmo!

48
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,479
Unhand her, Jizzmaster Zero!

49
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,480
You can't defeat me, Orgazmo!

50
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,440
Oh yeah I can, too!

51
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:11,761
I'll use my Orgazmorator!

52
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:14,722
Oh, this feels good.

53
00:04:16,784 --> 00:04:20,605
Now, I will kick your ass!

54
00:04:25,086 --> 00:04:26,288
Hello ma'am.

55
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,888
My goodness, you have such an
attractive little garden here.

56
00:04:29,988 --> 00:04:34,569
Why thank you, young man. I just planted
those flowers last week. My, how they grow!

57
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:35,550
Yes ma'am.

58
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,530
We're from the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

59
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,930
Oh, the Mormons.

60
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,092
That's right. I'm... I'm Elder Young,
and this is Elder White.

61
00:04:43,132 --> 00:04:48,294
- Well, you two boys can just fuck right off.
- Ma'am?

62
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:51,015
You heard me.
Take that Book of Mormom and shove it...

63
00:04:51,055 --> 00:04:54,295
... so far up your righteous
asses that you choke,...

64
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,657
... you soul-soliciting pigfuckers!

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Gosh.

66
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:06,939
Eat shit!

67
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:08,981
And you take this!

68
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:13,182
Ow! I jammed my finger! Ow!

69
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:15,700
- Cut!
- Ow! I jammed my finger!

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,800
Danger!

71
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,900
Cut!

72
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,145
Goddamnit, cut!

73
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:23,705
What the hell was that?!

74
00:05:25,186 --> 00:05:26,866
What is your problem Zizinsky?

75
00:05:27,506 --> 00:05:30,987
He blocked! He wasn't supposed to
block and he broke my finger!

76
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:34,709
You told me you knew how to fight.
Orgazmo's supposed to be a badass!

77
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:36,429
He shouldn't block me then!

78
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:42,271
Get back in there and look tough,
you fucking pansy!

79
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:46,112
I can't. My finger is broken.

80
00:05:48,914 --> 00:05:52,394
You listen to me, you cocky prick!

81
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:56,515
If you ever wanna work in porno again,
you'll do exactly what I say!

82
00:05:58,216 --> 00:05:59,596
Get back to work!

83
00:06:00,658 --> 00:06:03,058
Hey, where are you and Lisa
gonna have the wedding?

84
00:06:03,518 --> 00:06:07,059
Well, 'course Lisa wants to get married
in the Temple in Salt Lake City, but...

85
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,420
... it costs a lot of money.
I don't think I can afford it.

86
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,780
Yeah, I know what you mean.

87
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,082
I don't know why the Church makes it
so expensive to have a wedding there.

88
00:06:14,122 --> 00:06:17,003
Hey, don't worry. If you really
want something to happen,...

89
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,363
... the heavenly Father will
probably make it happen.

90
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,000
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

91
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:22,284
Action!

92
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:26,125
- I'm Jizzmaster Zero!
- Oh no. Help.

93
00:06:26,165 --> 00:06:27,766
No one's gonna help you now, honey!

94
00:06:27,806 --> 00:06:29,607
Somebody save me.

95
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:32,727
Orgazmo.

96
00:06:32,828 --> 00:06:34,968
Unhand her, Jizzmaster...

97
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:39,289
- What is that?
- The front door, stupid.

98
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:41,590
Cut! God-damnit!

99
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:42,971
Bilbo!

100
00:06:43,931 --> 00:06:47,932
Go see who that is and KILL them
for disrupting my shoot!!

101
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,400
Okay.

102
00:06:52,293 --> 00:06:55,295
- Hi. My name's Joseph Young.
- And I'm Robert White.

103
00:06:55,335 --> 00:06:57,736
We're with the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-Day Saints.

104
00:06:58,036 --> 00:07:00,196
- Okay. Hold on a second.
- Uh...

105
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:03,017
Uh, boss?

106
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,617
Some guys from... Jesus?

107
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,559
Cut off their balls!

108
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:12,080
- I've gotta cut your balls off now.
- Huh??

109
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,501
Why?

110
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:18,823
Hehey, we can take a hint. Uh... you're not
ready to change faiths right now. We respect that.

111
00:07:20,943 --> 00:07:22,624
- Hah! Come here!
- Waitwaitwait, no!

112
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,389
Now this is how you kick somebody's ass.

113
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,950
That oughta teach those Moonies
to stay away from my house.

114
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:47,592
Please. I don't wanna hurt you.

115
00:07:47,672 --> 00:07:48,672
You don't wanna hurt me, huh?

116
00:07:54,714 --> 00:07:56,754
Guards! More guards!

117
00:07:56,954 --> 00:07:59,556
Uh... Just let me get my buh,
my book and go.

118
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:17,441
Oh... Sorry.

119
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,600
You little pussy!

120
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:37,287
... Sorry... sorry.

121
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:38,689
Holly shit!

122
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:43,290
That was brilliant!

123
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,251
You're terrific, kid! What's your name?

124
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:49,411
Look, ah, ah... I didn't mean to hurt
these people, but they told...

125
00:08:49,451 --> 00:08:53,053
Oh no no no, they had it comin'
to them, the rotten bastards!

126
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:54,974
Why were you trying to hurt this man?!

127
00:08:56,174 --> 00:08:57,774
What is it that you wanted?

128
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,035
Well...

129
00:08:59,335 --> 00:09:02,555
... ah, I'm from the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints

130
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:03,836
Uh-huh.

131
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:07,598
And I wanna share my love
of Jesus with you.

132
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:13,499
Oh, why didn't you say so!
Come on in!

133
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:15,140
- Really?
- Come on!

134
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,061
I say unto you,
"Nay, they are many,...

135
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:20,902
...  yea, and we can witness
of their sincerity,...

136
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:22,783
... because of their love
towards their brethren, and...

137
00:09:22,783 --> 00:09:24,743
and also, towards us."

138
00:09:24,983 --> 00:09:27,784
So you see, Jesus Christ
spoke to prophets...

139
00:09:27,824 --> 00:09:29,224
... right here in the ancient Americas.

140
00:09:29,584 --> 00:09:32,946
- Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, I dig that Jesus guy.
- You do?

141
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:36,787
Oh, sure, the kids love him.
Happy Tart?

142
00:09:37,387 --> 00:09:38,267
Oh, thank you.

143
00:09:39,828 --> 00:09:40,908
Listen, kid,...

144
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:44,350
Have you ever considered acting?

145
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,691
Me? Oh... Yeah. Actually,
I majored in theater at BYU.

146
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:49,671
Go on...

147
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:51,972
Yeah. Are are you making a movie here?

148
00:09:51,912 --> 00:09:56,714
Yeah. And I want you to take over
as the leading man in my film.

149
00:09:57,594 --> 00:10:01,515
Me?? Really? Well. Wow!

150
00:10:02,395 --> 00:10:05,776
I still have another week of,
of mission work to do, but...

151
00:10:05,776 --> 00:10:07,237
... well what kind of movie is it?

152
00:10:07,277 --> 00:10:10,799
It's an action... adventure... porno.

153
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:15,320
Porno?
Like as in porno-graphic?

154
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,620
Well yeah, but it's not like that.

155
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,601
Oh. Oh, I don't do those,
those kind of movies.

156
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:25,923
Look, kid. It's two days' work and
I'll give you five thousand dollars.

157
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:27,954
Hey, you were only giving me three hundred.

158
00:10:27,954 --> 00:10:29,244
How's your finger, Chuchekchesh?

159
00:10:29,284 --> 00:10:31,365
- I think it's better. I'm ready to go.
- Yeah?

160
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:36,807
That's certainly is a lot of money, but I'm afraid
it goes against my beliefs. Thank you, very...

161
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:39,768
Looook, kid. You got me all wrong.

162
00:10:40,128 --> 00:10:42,728
This is not your average porno.

163
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,849
This is a very touching script.

164
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:48,611
It's a poignant story about
some very important issues.

165
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:52,412
About other people having... intercourse?

166
00:10:53,012 --> 00:10:56,713
- Well, this is an adult film.
- Well see, I can't do that.

167
00:10:56,813 --> 00:10:60,054
All right.
Make it seven thousand dollars.

168
00:11:00,214 --> 00:11:02,935
It's very nice of you to offer
me so much money, but...

169
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:04,016
Ten thousand.

170
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:07,217
I can't.
See, I have a fiancée, and if she ever...

171
00:11:07,217 --> 00:11:09,417
I got it! We use a stunt cock.

172
00:11:09,457 --> 00:11:12,218
Any time there's actual penetration,
we'll bring in another penis.

173
00:11:12,258 --> 00:11:17,500
We do it all the time. All you have to concern
yourself with is the crime-fighting, and the acting.

174
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:22,861
But see, I'd still be acting in a
pornographic movie. That's what I...

175
00:11:22,821 --> 00:11:25,062
Twenty thousand dollars.

176
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:28,144
- 'Scuse me?
- Twenty thousand dollars. Are you crazy?!

177
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:31,124
Twenty thousand dollars
for two days' work?

178
00:11:31,164 --> 00:11:33,265
And you don't even have to fuck.

179
00:11:36,226 --> 00:11:39,186
I... I have to think about this.
Can I think about this?

180
00:11:39,226 --> 00:11:42,308
Sure.
We start first thing Monday morning.

181
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:43,629
Wait, I have to think about this.

182
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,469
Yeah. You start at ten o'clock.

183
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:47,389
I'm gonna think about this now.

184
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,070
I don't know. He doesn't seem much
like the porno type to me, boss.

185
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,071
That's why he's so perfect for Orgazmo.

186
00:11:53,431 --> 00:11:55,232
He's so prissy, wholesome.

187
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:57,993
You watch. In a coupld of weeks,...

188
00:11:58,033 --> 00:12:01,474
... I'll make that little momma's boy
the biggest porn star in the country.

189
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,640
- Hello?
- Hi, Lise.

190
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,681
- Hi, honey!
- How are things in Utah?

191
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:24,522
Well Utah isn't as nice
without you, that's for sure.

192
00:12:24,562 --> 00:12:25,482
How are things there?

193
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:29,683
Oh, fine. I uh,...
I had an interesting day.

194
00:12:30,043 --> 00:12:31,523
I got offered a part in a movie.

195
00:12:32,244 --> 00:12:35,525
A movie?
Like... a Hollywood movie?

196
00:12:35,605 --> 00:12:37,846
Yeah. And it, and it pays a lot.

197
00:12:37,886 --> 00:12:39,686
Oh, Joe, that's wonderful!

198
00:12:40,647 --> 00:12:42,547
Is it enough so that we can
get married in the Temple?

199
00:12:42,607 --> 00:12:45,368
Lisa, it's twenty thousand dollars.

200
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,291
Oh, why you're the best, Joe.

201
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:54,071
Well, I don't know if
I'm gonna do it, Lise.

202
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:56,432
Mm, what? Well, why not?

203
00:12:56,992 --> 00:13:00,794
Eh... there's some things in the movie
that are... against God's way, and I...

204
00:13:00,854 --> 00:13:04,255
Joe, even if movies are a little...
crude now and then,...

205
00:13:04,295 --> 00:13:08,075
... I think that the Lord understands that
you need money for your family's future.

206
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,696
Twenty thousand dollars would
get us off to a great start.

207
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:13,258
I know it would.

208
00:13:13,698 --> 00:13:15,298
So what is it?
What are you acting in?

209
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,500
Oh... Uh, it's a... a... a....

210
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,120
"Death of a Salesman".

211
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,620
Oh! Let me guess who you're playing!
You're playing Biff, right?

212
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,181
Biff. Yeah.

213
00:13:27,062 --> 00:13:30,663
Oh, Daddy's here to take me to choir
practice, Joe. Can I call you back later?

214
00:13:30,703 --> 00:13:34,024
- Sure, sure.
- Jesus and I love you, Joe.

215
00:13:34,144 --> 00:13:35,864
Jesus and I love you, too, Lise.

216
00:13:35,944 --> 00:13:37,825
- Bye.
- Bye.

217
00:13:46,268 --> 00:13:49,489
Heavenly Father, please show me the way.

218
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:53,211
I know it would be sinful to act in
a movie that had sexual activity, but...

219
00:13:53,451 --> 00:13:55,631
... Lisa is so important to me,...

220
00:13:55,771 --> 00:13:58,672
... and I need the money for our
wedding and for a place to live.

221
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:04,353
Please, just... give me a sign
if you don't want me to do it.

222
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:20,259
Any sign at all.

223
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,841
Where is that little fucking choir boy?!

224
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:27,561
I don't think he's gonna show up.

225
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,902
Oh, really? Rodgers!

226
00:14:30,682 --> 00:14:33,444
You and pickle-dick here
go find that bastard!

227
00:14:33,484 --> 00:14:36,024
And you tell him, if he
doesn't act in my film,...

228
00:14:36,024 --> 00:14:39,325
... his parents, his friends,
his fuckin' PETS are gonna pay!

229
00:14:39,365 --> 00:14:44,526
You tell him, if he fucks
with me he'll sss... well hellooo!

230
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,300
Hello.

231
00:14:46,888 --> 00:14:49,289
We were just talking about you.
How are you?

232
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:50,529
I'm... fine.

233
00:14:50,569 --> 00:14:55,250
Super! Why don't you would get into
wardrobe and we'll get started right away.

234
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,492
Orbison, who am I fucking in this scene?

235
00:14:57,532 --> 00:15:01,693
Uh, you'll be fucking Jeff and probably Ben...
Have you met our new Orgazmo?

236
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,400
No.

237
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:05,113
- Hi, how you doing?
- Hi. Are we fucking?

238
00:15:05,674 --> 00:15:08,314
...No. You'll be fucking his stunt cock.

239
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,716
And I'm not doing any ass-licking today.
I told you that, right?

240
00:15:11,756 --> 00:15:13,857
Yes, yes. No ass-licking.

241
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,700
Okay. I am... not an ass-licker.

242
00:15:16,997 --> 00:15:18,958
Give 'em an inch, they take a mile.

243
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:23,459
Oh m..., what was I thinking??

244
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,661
There you are. Get in here! Come on!

245
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:28,221
Just get in there and
put this on! Put it on!

246
00:15:28,301 --> 00:15:30,002
- Okay, can I, uh...?
- Put it on now!

247
00:15:30,502 --> 00:15:30,982
Oh...

248
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,982
So you must be the new Orgazmo.

249
00:15:33,022 --> 00:15:36,223
No. I... well maybe. My name's Joe.

250
00:15:37,185 --> 00:15:39,425
Ben Chapleski. I play Choda Boy.

251
00:15:39,865 --> 00:15:42,126
- What's a Choda Boy?
- I'm your sidekick.

252
00:15:42,266 --> 00:15:44,746
- My sidekick? I have a sidekick?
- Yeah.

253
00:15:44,786 --> 00:15:45,300
What do...?

254
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,047
AH!

255
00:15:48,307 --> 00:15:50,029
Uh... I didn't know I had a sidekick.

256
00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:51,449
He didn't even tell you the plot?

257
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:53,750
No, he didn't. He just said I'm a superhero.

258
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,111
Right. You're Orgazmo, and you
fight crime with your Orgazmorator.

259
00:15:58,211 --> 00:15:59,251
And I'm your sidekick, and...

260
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:02,432
... I help you out with my...
specially designed sex toys.

261
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,000
Oh.

262
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,714
I don't think I've seen you before.
Are you new in this business?

263
00:16:07,514 --> 00:16:10,615
Oh. Yeah, this is my first time.
I'm actually a normal person.

264
00:16:11,455 --> 00:16:13,195
Hey, we're all normal people, man.

265
00:16:13,315 --> 00:16:16,237
Hell, I've got Ph.D.s for Physics
and Engineering from MIT.

266
00:16:16,317 --> 00:16:18,238
MIT? In Boston?

267
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:19,718
Naw, it's in Cambridge, actually.

268
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:23,719
...But if you have two Ph.D.s,
why do you do these kind of movies?

269
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,560
See you on set, Choda Boy.

270
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,260
That's why.

271
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:32,322
See, I have what's called a...
an overactive sex drive.

272
00:16:33,322 --> 00:16:36,883
Hey, just between you and me, I don't
get a whole lot of action from women.

273
00:16:38,124 --> 00:16:39,644
They don't seem to take me very seriously.

274
00:16:40,644 --> 00:16:41,484
You don't say...

275
00:16:41,725 --> 00:16:43,806
Yeah, but I get plenty of action here.

276
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,586
And I love every minute of it.

277
00:16:45,927 --> 00:16:47,927
But if you're such a scientific genius,...

278
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:51,408
... don't you think Heavenly Father has something...
more important planned for your life?

279
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,500
Who?

280
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,169
You.

281
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,650
...What??

282
00:17:02,492 --> 00:17:04,252
Stand back, Jizzmaster Zero!

283
00:17:09,054 --> 00:17:12,055
You look good, man.
Let's make some porno.

284
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,897
Hey, man, you need to shave your balls?

285
00:17:17,977 --> 00:17:19,737
What?? Why would I do that??

286
00:17:19,777 --> 00:17:21,498
All men love to shave their balls, Joe.

287
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:23,779
Makes the ol' Johnson look bigger.

288
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,300
- Here, give it a shot.
- Wha... no, I'm not, I'm using a stunt thing.

289
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,200
Oh, kid! You look fucking fabu!

290
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,100
- I see you met Choda Boy.
- Yes.

291
00:17:35,183 --> 00:17:38,584
Hey, that's not the only thing that changed.
I really beefed this script up.

292
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,404
Come on, people! Let's get shooting!

293
00:17:40,404 --> 00:17:41,444
- Mister... Mister Orbison?
- Yeah.

294
00:17:41,444 --> 00:17:43,945
You're not gonna put my name
anywhere in this movie, are you?

295
00:17:43,985 --> 00:17:46,665
Oh, no, kid. You'll get a stage name.
Everybody does.

296
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,227
- Now, let's see. Joe Young, right?
- Right.

297
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,468
Young, Young, Tongue, Bung, Hung. Hung!

298
00:17:51,508 --> 00:17:54,509
- Tom Hung! It's perfect! You like that?
- No.

299
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:57,189
Okay, people, let's go! Come on!
Set things up for me! Huh?

300
00:17:57,789 --> 00:17:59,610
Okay, this is what we're doing.

301
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:05,352
One: Ah... Candi, Saffi, and Jizzmaster Zero,
we're getting busy on the bed.

302
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,500
How busy?

303
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:12,594
Um... both of you are doing oral on him, and then
Two: Orgazmo and Choda Boy break through the wall.

304
00:18:12,914 --> 00:18:16,876
Three: They fight with Jizzmaster
Zero and his henchmen,...

305
00:18:16,956 --> 00:18:20,457
... and Four: you all fuck like nasty pigs.
Got it?

306
00:18:20,497 --> 00:18:22,077
Nasty pigs, got it.

307
00:18:22,398 --> 00:18:25,158
Whoa, whoa, Mr. Orbison, you you said
I wouldn't have to have sex, remember?

308
00:18:25,198 --> 00:18:27,520
You said we'd use a stunt... stunt...

309
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,601
Cock. A stunt cock. Yes, you get a
stunt cock, but only for penetration.

310
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:35,042
Penetration?? Who's gonna be penetrated?

311
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:38,362
Penetration is when the penis enters an orifice, Joe.

312
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:42,765
Penetration you don't do, but you do have
to get nasty with the ladies, that's the deal.

313
00:18:42,965 --> 00:18:47,006
- Muh-
- Okay people, let's go! Lights on!

314
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:50,607
Lights are on. It's stable, Captain.
Woohoo! Let's see some fuckin' action!!

315
00:18:50,647 --> 00:18:52,000
- Dave?
- Yeah?

316
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,128
- Calm down.
- Right. Sorry.

317
00:18:54,168 --> 00:18:58,890
You get me some nice close-ups.
And you, give me a nice slow zoom,...

318
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,970
... starting with a medium
closeup on the cock,...

319
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,091
... and then widening out
to an establishing shot.

320
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:06,332
Genius.

321
00:19:09,373 --> 00:19:10,454
Roll cameras.

322
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,500
And...

323
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,374
We're sucking.

324
00:19:15,775 --> 00:19:17,695
Good. Sucking...

325
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,617
Oh my gosh, I don't know
if I can go through with this.

326
00:19:22,657 --> 00:19:24,258
Oh, sure you can. Just do what I do.

327
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:32,300
That's some hot shit right there!
Check that out, man!

328
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,200
Goood.

329
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,582
We're sucking. We're suck...

330
00:19:35,662 --> 00:19:37,742
Yeah. Suck that cock!!

331
00:19:38,062 --> 00:19:40,343
Damnit Dave! Keep your mouth shut!

332
00:19:40,383 --> 00:19:42,543
Sorry, sorry dude, got a little excited.

333
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:44,584
Cue Orgazmo and Choda Boy!

334
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,906
Orgazmo!

335
00:19:48,946 --> 00:19:50,346
And Choda Boy!

336
00:19:50,386 --> 00:19:53,067
You can't defeat me, Orgazmo!

337
00:19:57,188 --> 00:19:59,710
You can't defeat me, Orgazmo.

338
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,351
That's your line, Hung.

339
00:20:04,391 --> 00:20:06,671
Hey! That's your line, Hung!

340
00:20:08,272 --> 00:20:11,593
Yeah, yeah I can, too!
I'll use my Orgazmorator!

341
00:20:12,314 --> 00:20:15,034
No, not that!
That feels good.

342
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:16,755
Nice shot!

343
00:20:19,996 --> 00:20:22,676
They hurt our evil boss, Jizzmaster Zero!

344
00:20:23,437 --> 00:20:24,758
Now you're gonna get some!

345
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,800
Need a hand?

346
00:20:37,241 --> 00:20:40,403
That's "handy work".
Now lock him up, Choda Boy.

347
00:20:43,604 --> 00:20:44,884
Are you okay, ladies?

348
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:47,765
We're fine, thanks to you, Orgazmo.

349
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:51,266
And Choda Boy.
Now it's time for us to repay you.

350
00:20:51,306 --> 00:20:54,127
Yeah, come on, boys. Let's get it on.

351
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:02,969
Kiss her.

352
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:08,532
Not like that. This is supposed to be erotic.

353
00:21:08,572 --> 00:21:10,252
Use your tongue, for Christ's sake!

354
00:21:10,972 --> 00:21:13,533
How would Christ benefit from me
putting my tongue in someone's mouth?

355
00:21:14,093 --> 00:21:16,654
Do you want your money or not, Hung?!

356
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,320
And cut. Stunt cock!

357
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,640
- Stunt cock!!!
- Stunt cock!

358
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:38,441
Hey, how are you doin'?

359
00:21:41,382 --> 00:21:42,222
Hey, how are you doin'?

360
00:21:44,424 --> 00:21:45,464
Hey, how are you doin'?

361
00:21:47,424 --> 00:21:49,345
I can't believe I'm doing this.

362
00:21:49,805 --> 00:21:52,986
- Hey. You know, you did a good job in there, man.
- Thank you.

363
00:21:53,026 --> 00:21:58,000
- Did you ever see that movie, Clash of the Titans?
- Oh wait, the Greek mythology play. Yeah, I've seen it.

364
00:21:58,028 --> 00:22:00,509
Yeah, I don't wanna sound like a queer or nothin',...

365
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:02,549
... but I think unicorns are kickass!

366
00:22:12,153 --> 00:22:13,033
What's that?

367
00:22:13,973 --> 00:22:17,834
Oh, uh, this is the Book of Mormon.
It's another testament of Jesus Christ.

368
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,800
Oh.

369
00:22:19,294 --> 00:22:20,435
Is it any good?

370
00:22:21,755 --> 00:22:23,436
Okay, people, let's go.

371
00:22:25,037 --> 00:22:25,717
Action!

372
00:22:29,358 --> 00:22:32,679
"For the time is at hand that all men
shall reap a reward of their works."

373
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:37,081
Eheheh, see, when the Mormons arrived
in Missouri, they needed to find jobs.

374
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:38,441
But no one would hire them...

375
00:22:38,481 --> 00:22:39,962
They should have done double anal.

376
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,662
Excuse me?

377
00:22:41,722 --> 00:22:44,242
Ah, you get to be my age,
you gotta do double anal...

378
00:22:44,282 --> 00:22:45,323
... or no one'll hire ya.

379
00:22:45,923 --> 00:22:50,205
Right. Um, see, people wouldn't hire
the Mormons because of their beliefs.

380
00:22:50,225 --> 00:22:52,926
Now, I'm the only one in town...

381
00:22:52,966 --> 00:22:55,966
... who'll do double anal and double
vaginal at the same time.

382
00:22:56,046 --> 00:22:59,247
You know, DVDA.
Well, it's how I still manage to get work.

383
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:03,089
I see, um... I don't I don't think
you quite understand what I'm...

384
00:23:03,129 --> 00:23:06,850
I?? Don't understand?? Hey look, pal,...

385
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,611
...you try havin' four dicks in ya at one time.

386
00:23:09,651 --> 00:23:10,611
No thank you!

387
00:23:11,051 --> 00:23:13,412
Hey lady!
We're ready for the DVDA shot!

388
00:23:14,732 --> 00:23:16,053
Nice talkin' to ya, kid

389
00:23:19,454 --> 00:23:21,295
Okay, let's do it!

390
00:23:21,655 --> 00:23:24,055
C'mon boys, grease 'em up!

391
00:23:28,738 --> 00:23:29,858
And action!

392
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,061
How's it goin' ace?
Oh! DVDA shot, huh?

393
00:23:41,101 --> 00:23:43,222
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
- Yeah, she's good.

394
00:23:44,363 --> 00:23:46,863
Hey, do you wanna get some sushi tonight?

395
00:23:57,267 --> 00:23:59,547
So what do you think of your first
day of porno, Joe?

396
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,800
Joe?

397
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:07,389
I'm a bad, bad Mormon.

398
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:11,191
Yo yo yo, what's up homies?

399
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:12,671
How's it going, G-Fresh?

400
00:24:12,732 --> 00:24:16,292
Oh, jussst kickin' it.
You know what I'm saying, G.

401
00:24:16,313 --> 00:24:20,313
Ohhh yeah.
G-Fresh in the motherfucking house.

402
00:24:20,474 --> 00:24:22,735
Hey G-Fresh, I want you to meet Orgazmo.

403
00:24:22,835 --> 00:24:23,755
I'm not Orgazmo!

404
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,236
I don't want anyone to know.

405
00:24:29,437 --> 00:24:31,717
My name is Joe, Joe Young.
How do yo do?

406
00:24:32,077 --> 00:24:35,879
Oh, jussst kickin' it. The dough prime
and the smooth out ourum bitches.

407
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,480
- You know what I'm saying.
- No...

408
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,920
How are you doin', G-Fresh?

409
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:43,601
You! Get your punk asses out of my sushi bar!

410
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:49,003
Oh, we'll get our punk asses outta your fish bar...
just as soon as you sign this little piece of paper.

411
00:24:49,043 --> 00:24:51,444
I told you I ain't gonna sign!

412
00:24:51,484 --> 00:24:54,045
I ain't gonna givin' up my place!

413
00:24:54,245 --> 00:24:55,485
Who are these guys?

414
00:24:55,605 --> 00:24:58,246
These are the Gs I've been
telling you about from next door.

415
00:24:58,286 --> 00:25:01,007
They are trying to buy out my restaurant...

416
00:25:01,047 --> 00:25:04,048
... so they can make their dance club bigger!

417
00:25:04,248 --> 00:25:06,329
But, homie don't play that!

418
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:07,629
Why don't you guys get lost, huh?

419
00:25:07,689 --> 00:25:09,249
Keep your mouth shut, Tiny Tim!

420
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:12,690
Hey, whoawhoawhoa, I...  ah... I think
we all need to calm down a little bit here.

421
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:16,372
Oh, gee, that man's right. We're real sorry.

422
00:25:16,412 --> 00:25:17,893
We'll leave Mr. Fresh alone.

423
00:25:18,213 --> 00:25:21,093
Oh, yeah. Please excuse the mix-up, please.

424
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,961
You'd better make up your mind real quick, Fresh,...

425
00:25:41,961 --> 00:25:44,581
... because our boss isn't gonna
give you such a good deal next time.

426
00:25:55,145 --> 00:25:57,305
Oh, shouldn't we call the police or something?

427
00:25:58,906 --> 00:26:00,706
Joe, the police can't help.

428
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,827
Geez, where are you from?
Iowa or something?

429
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:08,749
- No, Utah.
- Oh... I'm sorry.

430
00:26:16,513 --> 00:26:25,354
Yeah. Oh, Oh so good! So good!
Oh! Do you like it? Do you like it??

431
00:26:25,995 --> 00:26:31,017
- Ring the bell! Ring the bell!
- Ring the bell! Ding ding dong...

432
00:26:31,017 --> 00:26:34,618
- ... ding ding!
- ... ding ding! You...

433
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,118
... line?

434
00:26:36,118 --> 00:26:38,038
"You guys got me so horny!".

435
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:42,080
Oh, yeah. You guys got me so horny!

436
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,722
Come on, Hung.
You gotta at least look like you're enjoying this.

437
00:26:47,322 --> 00:26:49,300
Rub her breasts or something.

438
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,403
- Come on. Come on, Hung.
- Do I have to?

439
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:54,244
Don't worry, dude. They're not real.

440
00:26:56,684 --> 00:26:59,526
Yeah, there you go, buddy! Get some!

441
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:03,607
We're onto you, Orgazmo!

442
00:27:03,607 --> 00:27:06,408
Yeah. Your days of superherodom are over!

443
00:27:06,448 --> 00:27:07,848
Not so fast, guys!

444
00:27:07,888 --> 00:27:09,808
My Orgazmorator should take care of you!

445
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,630
Your turn, Choda Boy.

446
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,400
Right!

447
00:27:14,931 --> 00:27:17,571
My blue harpoon thang should do the trick!

448
00:27:21,332 --> 00:27:23,013
Looks like they're all tied up at the moment.

449
00:27:24,134 --> 00:27:25,054
Bon soir!

450
00:27:26,935 --> 00:27:28,055
That was... too easy.

451
00:27:28,935 --> 00:27:30,736
Great job, guys.

452
00:27:31,336 --> 00:27:34,977
Now, how about we go really nasty.

453
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:42,219
Cut!!

454
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,300
- Oh...
- Dude! She's dead!

455
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,181
I'm glad you could come over for dinner, Joe.

456
00:27:47,221 --> 00:27:49,941
I'm really excited to show you
my laboratory where I design things.

457
00:27:49,981 --> 00:27:52,783
I think you might find one thing
in particular very interesting.

458
00:27:55,744 --> 00:27:56,904
Did you say something?

459
00:27:58,144 --> 00:27:59,705
Nah, I was just thinkin'.

460
00:28:01,345 --> 00:28:02,385
Come on in.

461
00:28:05,347 --> 00:28:08,148
Goodness gee. Is this all yours?

462
00:28:08,468 --> 00:28:11,029
Yeah. Bought and paid for,...

463
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:12,589
... with all the patents I have.

464
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:16,391
See, when I'm not doin' the flicks, I invent stuff.

465
00:28:16,431 --> 00:28:18,031
I'm makin' some serious cash from it.

466
00:28:18,351 --> 00:28:19,512
Oh, what's this here?

467
00:28:20,952 --> 00:28:22,272
I guess I never told you.

468
00:28:23,873 --> 00:28:24,793
Told me what?

469
00:28:27,634 --> 00:28:28,794
See, when I was a kid,...

470
00:28:29,755 --> 00:28:31,396
... I learned a lot of different kung-fu styles.

471
00:28:32,556 --> 00:28:34,196
One of the styles was hamster.

472
00:28:34,556 --> 00:28:36,737
Hamster style... I don't think
I've seen you do hamster.

473
00:28:37,357 --> 00:28:41,558
No. Well, I vowed to my father
I would never use hamster-style again.

474
00:28:42,078 --> 00:28:45,320
- Why? What happened?
- I don't like to talk about it.

475
00:28:46,341 --> 00:28:48,661
Well, maybe it would help you to talk about it.

476
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,521
You know, get it out.

477
00:28:51,702 --> 00:28:52,842
I don't know if I can.

478
00:28:54,562 --> 00:28:56,244
Well what are you running from, man?

479
00:28:56,804 --> 00:28:58,244
I don't know.

480
00:28:59,965 --> 00:29:01,945
I guess maybe I'm just runnin' from myself.

481
00:29:04,126 --> 00:29:07,407
I mean, it happened several years ago, but
I can remember it like it was just yeasterday.

482
00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:13,129
- Hey Dad?
- Mhm?

483
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:16,610
I don't think I'm going to do hamster-style anymore.

484
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,290
That's nice.

485
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:29,254
And that's the way it went down, man.

486
00:29:30,774 --> 00:29:34,855
Shit. I can still smell that newspaper.

487
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:40,378
You know, it does. It does feel better to get it out.

488
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:45,879
Come on, I wanna show you something.

489
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:53,622
By the time I finally got this ol' momma
to work, it had a lot of parts.

490
00:29:54,182 --> 00:29:57,183
The sucker got pretty heavy.
I could barely even lift it now.

491
00:29:56,983 --> 00:29:57,863
What is it?

492
00:29:58,503 --> 00:30:00,744
It's the Orgazmorator. I made it work.

493
00:30:03,225 --> 00:30:04,626
Golly, it's huge.

494
00:30:04,786 --> 00:30:07,266
Yeah. I could probably
make a compact version,...

495
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,707
... but then I'd have
to use cold fusion...

496
00:30:08,747 --> 00:30:10,867
... instead of the fission
devices inside of it now.

497
00:30:11,488 --> 00:30:14,269
But then, if I could figure out
cold fusion, I'd be a millionaire!

498
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:23,992
Want to give it a shot?

499
00:30:24,592 --> 00:30:25,392
How?

500
00:30:26,892 --> 00:30:27,700
Here.

501
00:30:30,394 --> 00:30:31,915
Stick your arm in this thing here.

502
00:30:33,395 --> 00:30:35,275
Grab hold of the handle
and it should power up.

503
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:42,818
Calm down, dude! Calm down, it's okay.
It's just powering up. It's okay.

504
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:45,319
You can actually hold that thing, huh?

505
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:49,740
- It's... not that heavy.
- That's sweet.

506
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,680
So now what?

507
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:56,363
So now, I mean, it's... you know, I mean, it's like a gun.
I mean, you feel a little trigger on the handle there?

508
00:30:57,403 --> 00:30:58,123
This one?

509
00:31:01,404 --> 00:31:02,764
Oh my gosh, are you okay??

510
00:31:10,207 --> 00:31:11,007
Thanks, man.

511
00:31:12,608 --> 00:31:14,128
Awww, you're puttin' me on.

512
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:16,889
No. I told you it works.

513
00:31:18,689 --> 00:31:20,971
Go ahead. Shoot yourself.

514
00:31:22,211 --> 00:31:23,371
No, I... couldn't.

515
00:31:23,411 --> 00:31:26,952
Go on, give yourself a treat! Just shoot
yourself in the foot or something.

516
00:31:26,992 --> 00:31:28,333
I gotta get cleaned off.

517
00:31:35,255 --> 00:31:36,255
I told ya!

518
00:31:38,016 --> 00:31:41,057
I told ya it works! Do me again!

519
00:31:41,617 --> 00:31:42,697
This is incredible.

520
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:45,658
Come on! Do me again.

521
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,421
Amazing. And you made this thing, huh?

522
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,622
Whooh, yeah.

523
00:31:57,522 --> 00:32:00,744
Hahhh, sure beats jerkin', huh?
Gettin' your arm all tired?

524
00:32:01,524 --> 00:32:05,505
Wow. Heavenly Father has really
given you a gift for science.

525
00:32:05,785 --> 00:32:09,506
Yeah, whatever.
Hey, can you walk around with that thing on?

526
00:32:10,026 --> 00:32:11,386
I think so. Why?

527
00:32:12,107 --> 00:32:13,588
Wanna go have some fun?

528
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:14,907
Get up against the wall. Spread your legs.

529
00:33:15,247 --> 00:33:17,567
Keep your arm up there!
You have the right...

530
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:40,375
-All right, gigolo, this is the last scene for the day.
Are you okay?

531
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:44,057
- No...
- Good. This is the scene where the evil Keena Rexis...

532
00:33:44,097 --> 00:33:47,258
... whisks you back in time to the
Garden of Eden. Nice, huh?

533
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:50,779
Look at me. It's just you
and T Rex in this scene,...

534
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:52,499
...so we're gonna need
a lot of hot action...

535
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:54,980
... before we bring in your
stunt cock. All right?

536
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,060
Go ahead, lay down.

537
00:33:59,462 --> 00:34:01,582
...Why do they call her T-Rex?

538
00:34:08,144 --> 00:34:10,266
Hi fellas, I'm ready to fuck.

539
00:34:10,306 --> 00:34:11,826
Oh my gosh!

540
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:14,867
- You want me on top?
- No! No. Ah, I'll be on top.

541
00:34:15,467 --> 00:34:19,348
You're gonna make my come,
or I'm gonna kick your butt.

542
00:34:20,788 --> 00:34:21,629
Action!

543
00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:30,712
Come on! Come on now! Ah! Oh, baby!
Oh, you make me so hot now! Come on!

544
00:34:30,952 --> 00:34:31,972
Oh, that's great.

545
00:34:32,032 --> 00:34:33,793
Oh, you make me so hot!!

546
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:38,675
Come on! Fudge me now! Fudge me now!
Come on! Come on!

547
00:35:16,287 --> 00:35:18,688
Oohh, come on, lover! Baby!

548
00:35:18,888 --> 00:35:21,248
Damn, dude, that's some
hot shit right there.

549
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:26,410
Hey! Can I get everyone
together for a few photos?

550
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:29,851
- Photos.. photos for what?
- Just some stills for publicity.

551
00:35:30,892 --> 00:35:32,812
You know, I don't wanna sound
like a queer or nothin',...

552
00:35:32,852 --> 00:35:34,933
... but I'm really gonna miss you guys
when the show is over.

553
00:35:35,493 --> 00:35:38,093
Ben, do you think people will see
this video in Utah?

554
00:35:38,494 --> 00:35:39,854
I wouldn't worry about it, dude.

555
00:35:39,894 --> 00:35:42,776
Some of these movies we've made every
month, no one is even gonna notice.

556
00:35:42,856 --> 00:35:45,456
Say... Geddy Lee.

557
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:49,537
- Who's Geddy Lee?
- Geddy Lee! Best bass player ever! Come on!

558
00:35:50,177 --> 00:35:51,138
Geddy Lee.

559
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:23,709
Mr. Orbison, it's Joe Young.

560
00:36:23,749 --> 00:36:25,989
Oh Hung! Joe Hung, how are you?

561
00:36:26,029 --> 00:36:29,030
I wa... I actually haven't received
my money yet, and I was wonderi...

562
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:32,551
Of course, Joe. Your money, you know,
I was just over at the accounting department,...

563
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:35,413
... and I think they were putting the
checks through the big check processor.

564
00:36:44,355 --> 00:36:47,357
No. I got my mail today
and... and it's not there.

565
00:36:47,657 --> 00:36:49,517
Those diry bastards!

566
00:36:49,597 --> 00:36:52,298
Well I need to get it
before I can go home, see? I...

567
00:36:52,718 --> 00:36:54,618
I'll have that fuckin' postman for lunch!

568
00:36:54,618 --> 00:36:57,279
You know, I put that thing in the
mail three times now, Young!

569
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,500
Okay.

570
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,321
An exclusive look at the story...

571
00:37:00,361 --> 00:37:02,762
... behind the crossover success of the decade.

572
00:37:06,843 --> 00:37:09,963
- Stand back, Jizzmaster Zero!
- You can't get me, Orgazmo!

573
00:37:10,243 --> 00:37:12,724
I'll get you with my... Orgazmorator!

574
00:37:14,645 --> 00:37:17,126
How does a movie about a sex superhero...

575
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:19,167
... become a box-office smash?

576
00:37:22,047 --> 00:37:24,768
This year's John Holmes award goes to...

577
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,890
Tom Hung for Orgazmo!

578
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,600
Gosh.

579
00:37:46,495 --> 00:37:47,936
Holy shit!

580
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:49,736
What's the difference between Orgazmo...

581
00:37:49,776 --> 00:37:52,097
... and your previous porn titles,
like Schindler's Fist?

582
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:55,739
I really think history will describe
Orgazmo better than I possibly could.

583
00:38:21,227 --> 00:38:22,187
Hi, Ben.

584
00:38:22,547 --> 00:38:25,548
Hey Georgi. God-damn!
Did your breasts get bigger??

585
00:38:25,548 --> 00:38:27,288
Yeah, I... uh... I upgraded.

586
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:30,349
My doctor says now I have
enough silicone in my body...

587
00:38:30,389 --> 00:38:32,791
... to kill a small elephant.
Isn't that cool?

588
00:38:33,951 --> 00:38:34,951
Hey Orgazmo!

589
00:38:35,151 --> 00:38:38,492
I'm not Orgazmo.
My name is Joe, okay? Not Orgazmo.

590
00:38:38,872 --> 00:38:41,973
Man, you should be psyched to be Orgazmo.
Especially today, I mean...

591
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,874
Look at this party.
Everybody in the business is here today!

592
00:38:44,954 --> 00:38:48,356
I don't know any of these people.
I just came to get the rest of my money and go.

593
00:38:48,556 --> 00:38:49,636
Choda-boy!

594
00:38:53,557 --> 00:38:54,557
Hey! Orgazmo!

595
00:38:54,717 --> 00:38:56,158
- I'm not Orgazmo, okay?
- Yeah.

596
00:38:56,158 --> 00:38:57,358
Have you seen Mr. Orbison?

597
00:38:57,398 --> 00:38:59,680
Oh, yeah. I think he's over
there someplace or something.

598
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,200
- Hey, what do you think of this band?
- Um... fine.

599
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,781
Yeah. I think they kind of sound
like Depeche Mode.

600
00:39:08,202 --> 00:39:09,822
You know, I don't wanna sound
like a queer or nothin',...

601
00:39:09,862 --> 00:39:11,804
... but I think Depeche Mode
is a sweet band.

602
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:14,004
That's nice.

603
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,400
Oh yeah oh yeah. You know my homie
got the bitches and the cheap boca cheap.

604
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,300
Got my jimmy on your tosset
and the rhyme of feelin' ill.

605
00:39:24,768 --> 00:39:27,208
Oh sorry. We are not open yet.

606
00:39:27,568 --> 00:39:30,169
Oh that's okay.
We're not hungry anyway.

607
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:32,330
You get outta here!

608
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,690
Regarding the contract,...

609
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,850
... our boss told us to make
you a better offer.

610
00:39:37,171 --> 00:39:39,572
Now, here's the pen.
Here's the contract.

611
00:39:39,612 --> 00:39:44,534
Bitch! You gonna get popped!
If you keep ridin' me!

612
00:39:44,574 --> 00:39:47,334
Oops. Wrong answer, homie!

613
00:39:49,015 --> 00:39:52,057
Hey Hung, just the man I wanted to talk to!

614
00:39:52,097 --> 00:39:54,377
I actually just came by to collect
the rest of my money.

615
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:56,098
Oh yeah, sure, sure. Here, here.

616
00:39:56,798 --> 00:39:59,978
Hey listen. Joe. That is a lot of money.

617
00:40:00,299 --> 00:40:02,659
That's nothing for a man of your talent.

618
00:40:06,381 --> 00:40:09,262
Heheh. How do you like that, G?!

619
00:40:11,783 --> 00:40:14,543
Oh, you dirty bastard!

620
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:16,664
Come on.

621
00:40:16,785 --> 00:40:20,826
You better check yourself before
you wreck wreck wreck yourself.

622
00:40:21,706 --> 00:40:23,466
One! Two!

623
00:40:26,787 --> 00:40:28,628
Oh, that hurts.

624
00:40:28,628 --> 00:40:30,549
- You gonna sign the papers?
- Your momma!

625
00:40:30,589 --> 00:40:32,590
- Are you gonna sign the papers?!
- Your momma!!

626
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:36,631
Oh no no, not the glass.
I just replaced it.

627
00:40:38,031 --> 00:40:41,552
Oooohhhh! Oh, that hurt so bahahad!

628
00:40:43,172 --> 00:40:44,834
A sequel! You wanna do a sequ...

629
00:40:46,234 --> 00:40:48,795
With the success of this thing,
how could I not wanna make a sequel?

630
00:40:48,975 --> 00:40:53,196
Look, Joe, I know how crucial
you are to Orgazmo's popularity.

631
00:40:53,236 --> 00:40:59,278
That's why... I'm doubling your salary.
Forty... thousand... dollars.

632
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:02,119
Oh, boy.

633
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,922
- Sign the paper!
- Ohohoh. Okay, okay. I will sign it.

634
00:41:09,962 --> 00:41:12,562
Yeah, I know you'd see it our way. Sign it!

635
00:41:21,205 --> 00:41:24,807
Thank you Los Naked Mariachis.

636
00:41:25,207 --> 00:41:28,487
People, I have a very important
announcement to make!

637
00:41:28,607 --> 00:41:34,409
In three days, we will begin principal
photography on "Orgazmo 2".

638
00:41:45,613 --> 00:41:47,213
- Hello.
- Hi honey!

639
00:41:47,253 --> 00:41:50,935
- Oh, Lisa! Oh, hi.
- How are you?

640
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:55,716
Oh I... I'm fine.
I... I have some news.

641
00:41:55,736 --> 00:41:56,736
Good or bad?

642
00:41:56,816 --> 00:42:02,059
Well, good and bad, I guess.
Uh... they want me to do a sequel.

643
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:04,979
- A sequel?
- Yeah.

644
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,680
To "Death of a Salesman"?

645
00:42:09,841 --> 00:42:12,101
What? Wait, doesn't he die
at the end of the first one?

646
00:42:13,622 --> 00:42:20,664
Um... Yes. Yes, he does. But... but he has
a twin brother, who... who wants revenge now.

647
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:24,705
Revenge? But... he kills himself, didn't he?

648
00:42:26,026 --> 00:42:29,988
Nooo. Nooo. That, that's just
what you were led to believe.

649
00:42:30,028 --> 00:42:35,749
He was killed by the CIA
for selling smack... to... Nazis.

650
00:42:37,149 --> 00:42:40,710
Wow! All this time I thought
"Death of a Salesman" was boring.

651
00:42:40,831 --> 00:42:44,872
But Lisa, they're giving me
forty thousand dollars this time.

652
00:42:46,513 --> 00:42:48,073
Oh, you're the best, Joe!

653
00:42:48,393 --> 00:42:52,794
Oh poopie! Forty thousand dollars.
We can almost buy a house.

654
00:42:53,074 --> 00:42:56,636
I know. And that's why I... agreed to do it.

655
00:42:58,017 --> 00:43:01,117
Oh, I have to go, Joe.
Daddy's here to pick me up...

656
00:43:01,157 --> 00:43:05,478
For choir practice, I know.
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

657
00:43:05,478 --> 00:43:08,720
Okay. Jesus and I love you, Joe.

658
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,841
Jesus and I love you, too, cupcake. Byebye.

659
00:43:26,046 --> 00:43:28,326
Hey! You're Orgazmo, aren't you?

660
00:43:28,366 --> 00:43:32,047
No. I mean, yes. My name's Joe.
I play a character named Orgazmo.

661
00:43:32,087 --> 00:43:33,809
- Listen, don't get fancy with me, kiddo...
- No, I wo...

662
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,390
You're not the bad boy around here anymore.

663
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:43,891
The name is A-Cup; I play Neutered Man.

664
00:43:43,971 --> 00:43:44,891
Neutered Man?

665
00:43:44,931 --> 00:43:46,413
Orgazmo's new arch-enemy!

666
00:43:46,893 --> 00:43:50,174
Don't you get it? Neutered Man!
He has no balls!

667
00:43:50,374 --> 00:43:52,614
Orgazmo's little ray won't work on him!

668
00:43:52,854 --> 00:43:55,655
- But... Orgazmo beats him, right?
- How??

669
00:43:56,215 --> 00:43:57,255
Well Orgazmo will find a way...

670
00:43:57,295 --> 00:43:58,500
- How???
- I don't know.

671
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,058
Read the script, duder!
Orgazmo doesn't find a way!

672
00:44:02,058 --> 00:44:03,338
Neutered Man escapes!

673
00:44:04,398 --> 00:44:08,279
You know, it's funny.
You look a lot tougher on the screen.

674
00:44:15,022 --> 00:44:18,463
Maybe I'll show you some real moves sometime.
Asshole.

675
00:44:20,463 --> 00:44:21,723
Hey, whattaya think, Ace?

676
00:44:21,863 --> 00:44:24,624
I don't like it. It doesn't have
the spirit of the first one.

677
00:44:24,864 --> 00:44:25,785
And action.

678
00:44:29,866 --> 00:44:31,827
Now that I have you at the Parthenon,...

679
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:35,068
... I will sacrifice you to the god of lust.

680
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:38,669
You're so evil, Neutered Man!

681
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:41,830
If Orgazmo was here,
he wouldn't let you do this to us.

682
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:44,071
I'm not afraid of Orgazmo!

683
00:44:44,271 --> 00:44:46,031
Did someone say my name?

684
00:44:46,592 --> 00:44:48,512
Orgazmo!

685
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:49,832
And Choda Boy!

686
00:44:51,794 --> 00:44:53,034
Let them go, Neutered Man!

687
00:44:53,074 --> 00:44:55,555
Never! I'll kill you first!

688
00:45:04,397 --> 00:45:07,679
Your little ray has no effect on meeee, Orgazmo!

689
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:14,601
Why doesn't your Orgazmo ray work on him, Orgazmo?

690
00:45:14,641 --> 00:45:17,441
I don't know, Choda Boy. It's all Greek to me.

691
00:45:20,883 --> 00:45:24,564
- Orgazmo, you saved us.
- How can we ever repay you?

692
00:45:24,604 --> 00:45:26,044
I have an idea.

693
00:45:37,088 --> 00:45:39,969
Cut. Stunt cock.

694
00:45:40,009 --> 00:45:41,569
- Stunt cock.
- Stunt cock.

695
00:45:53,693 --> 00:45:55,214
- Rogers?
- Yeah boss.

696
00:45:56,494 --> 00:45:57,695
...Who is that?

697
00:45:58,916 --> 00:46:00,796
Oh, that's Ted, the new stunt cock guy.

698
00:46:02,696 --> 00:46:04,437
...And you don't see a problem with this?

699
00:46:06,737 --> 00:46:07,618
Nope.

700
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,300
All right, fuck it.

701
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,101
Hey, is that a new costume, Joe?

702
00:46:15,701 --> 00:46:18,061
No, I think it's the same one we've always used.

703
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:23,102
You know, I don't wanna sound like a queer or
nothin', but I think you've got a really nice ass.

704
00:46:26,024 --> 00:46:28,785
- Uh... Thanks?
- Sure, dude.

705
00:46:38,108 --> 00:46:42,469
What the hell? G-Fresh, what happened
to you, man? How'd you get that scratch?

706
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:47,471
Oh, I'm sorry, Gs. I'm closing down.
I have to be out in two weeks.

707
00:46:47,591 --> 00:46:48,911
What? Why?

708
00:46:49,111 --> 00:46:52,353
Well the punks from next door got me angry.

709
00:46:52,513 --> 00:46:53,753
You signed the papers?

710
00:46:53,713 --> 00:46:59,775
Well they came in the other day, and
just whupped my sorry black ass. Oh...

711
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,475
Did you call the police?

712
00:47:03,116 --> 00:47:05,757
I make you guys last sushi for half price.

713
00:47:06,117 --> 00:47:07,237
Gozaimasen.

714
00:47:07,518 --> 00:47:10,838
Um.. just give me tuna, salmon, shrimp.

715
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:15,039
We've got to help him, Joe.

716
00:47:16,961 --> 00:47:19,241
Oh, right. What are we gonna do
against a gang of thugs?

717
00:47:19,722 --> 00:47:22,422
Look, you and I are both
great martial artists, right?

718
00:47:22,522 --> 00:47:26,723
I mean, we're pretty good. And I'm willing to bet
that between the two of us we can take these guys.

719
00:47:27,724 --> 00:47:29,705
Those guys probably have guns, Ben.

720
00:47:29,705 --> 00:47:31,005
Martial arts don't stop guns.

721
00:47:31,005 --> 00:47:33,900
Ma do itashimashita. Hai, douzo.
(My pleasure. Here, please.)

722
00:47:37,327 --> 00:47:39,167
- Jesus!
- Where?

723
00:47:39,167 --> 00:47:41,648
Joe! I just got the most amazing idea ever.

724
00:47:41,728 --> 00:47:45,650
The Orgazmorator, Joe!
You can use the Orgazmorator as a weapon!

725
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:47,290
You can stun anybody who has a gun,...

726
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:49,691
... take 'em out of commission!
And we kick their asses.

727
00:47:49,731 --> 00:47:53,172
- Are you nuts?? That... that won't work!
- Why not?!

728
00:47:53,772 --> 00:47:57,094
Well ...Even if we succeded, those guys
would come after us eventually.

729
00:47:57,834 --> 00:47:59,054
We can use disguises.

730
00:47:59,975 --> 00:48:02,115
We can cover ourselves up
so nobody can recognize us.

731
00:48:02,135 --> 00:48:04,376
- That won't work!
- Why not??

732
00:48:04,736 --> 00:48:06,656
Because it won't, gosh darnit!

733
00:48:13,379 --> 00:48:14,919
I'll tell you something, Joe.

734
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:19,740
There's nothing sadder
than a sad Japanese man.

735
00:48:20,141 --> 00:48:21,622
Boy, I'll say.

736
00:48:24,543 --> 00:48:26,023
So what do you say, pal?

737
00:48:27,503 --> 00:48:28,904
We can wear disguises?

738
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:49,031
We look ridiculous.

739
00:48:49,791 --> 00:48:55,192
Dude, listen, it's the way people in this club dress,
awright? We've got to fit in. Here, put this shit on.

740
00:48:56,953 --> 00:48:59,513
- All right, so what's the plan?
- Why are you asking me?

741
00:49:01,555 --> 00:49:04,916
...'kay. We go in the front door,...

742
00:49:04,956 --> 00:49:06,716
... then we walk to the back,
grab the contracts,...

743
00:49:06,756 --> 00:49:10,477
... and if anyone tries to stop us,
we fuck his shit up.

744
00:49:11,357 --> 00:49:13,758
That's a great plan, Ben.
Really well thought out.

745
00:49:13,799 --> 00:49:15,399
Let's kick some ass, baby!

746
00:49:27,963 --> 00:49:29,124
Head to the back!

747
00:49:38,966 --> 00:49:40,768
Come on, Joe! Up the stairs!

748
00:49:46,209 --> 00:49:47,769
Oh, it's locked. Too bad.

749
00:49:47,809 --> 00:49:50,810
Don't worry! I have the Slim Johnson.

750
00:49:58,013 --> 00:49:59,373
What the fuck is this?

751
00:49:59,773 --> 00:50:02,614
You have a contract signed by G-Fresh!
We want it back!

752
00:50:02,954 --> 00:50:04,875
You gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me, right?

753
00:50:07,376 --> 00:50:09,337
- Jimmy, kick their asses.
- You kick their asses.

754
00:50:09,377 --> 00:50:10,238
Jimmy, kick their asses.

755
00:50:10,238 --> 00:50:12,500
I'm tired of kicking everybody's ass.
I'm not kicking their asses.

756
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,438
- Yeah, my heart bleeds for ya...
- Kick their fuckin' asses!

757
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:16,939
Go. Guppy, play.

758
00:50:22,781 --> 00:50:24,661
Com'ere, you little... whatever you are!

759
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,300
Joe!

760
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:51,910
I'll kill you!

761
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,200
Die!

762
00:51:27,002 --> 00:51:29,763
- Where's the contract?!
- What contract?

763
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,004
God-damnit!
I'm not gonna ask you again!

764
00:51:35,044 --> 00:51:37,365
All right! All right already!
It's over there.

765
00:51:39,766 --> 00:51:40,886
Got it!

766
00:51:46,608 --> 00:51:49,208
I strongly suggest you don't
mess with G-Fresh anymore!

767
00:51:49,248 --> 00:51:51,370
You mess with him, we mess with you!

768
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:55,971
Bye-bye. God bless.

769
00:51:58,212 --> 00:51:59,572
Look out, fucker!

770
00:52:02,213 --> 00:52:04,174
Rocco! Stop them!

771
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,400
Yuktuki!

772
00:52:37,424 --> 00:52:38,425
Curses!

773
00:52:41,385 --> 00:52:42,586
Curses?

774
00:52:43,267 --> 00:52:46,788
Woo! Yeah! God, that kicked ass, didn't it?!

775
00:52:46,828 --> 00:52:47,908
No, it was horrible!

776
00:52:48,828 --> 00:52:54,390
What are you talkin' about?! God, we got in there, we
kicked their ass, we got the contract, and we got out!

777
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:56,831
Fuck, dude, it couldn't be
scripted any better than that!

778
00:52:57,771 --> 00:52:59,192
Actually, I take that back.

779
00:52:59,232 --> 00:53:03,193
That guy... was pointing a gun at me.
He could've shot me, Ben.

780
00:53:03,393 --> 00:53:06,874
And all I know...
is that little guys always get stepped on.

781
00:53:06,914 --> 00:53:09,154
Tonight, we did some stepping!

782
00:53:09,194 --> 00:53:11,836
And all I know is I gotta
get the heck out of Los Angeles.

783
00:53:11,876 --> 00:53:14,076
Way too much weird stuff goes on here!

784
00:53:18,037 --> 00:53:18,838
Surprise!

785
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:24,480
- Hi, honey.
- Lisa? What are you doing here?

786
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:28,601
I couldn't take it anymore. Daddy lent me
some money to come out. Isn't that great??

787
00:53:28,641 --> 00:53:31,121
Noo! I mean... I mean...

788
00:53:31,802 --> 00:53:33,282
... bo- Boy, I'll say!

789
00:53:33,322 --> 00:53:34,643
How long you staying?

790
00:53:34,983 --> 00:53:36,204
Until the show's over.

791
00:53:37,944 --> 00:53:42,526
I know! I know. I know. I know. I know.
Living together before we're married is strange.

792
00:53:42,566 --> 00:53:44,606
But I figure, heck, the Lord won't be angry...

793
00:53:44,606 --> 00:53:46,807
... as long as I sleep on the couch, right?

794
00:53:48,347 --> 00:53:50,248
I... actually I don't know, Lise.

795
00:53:50,248 --> 00:53:52,929
The Lord's kinda tricky when
it comes to stuff like that.

796
00:53:54,249 --> 00:53:56,170
Waitwaitwait, hold on, hold on. Ah...

797
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:00,451
Wow, this is a much nicer apartment
than I thought you'd have.

798
00:54:00,851 --> 00:54:02,252
Yeah, I got some new stuff.

799
00:54:03,853 --> 00:54:06,413
Oh, when is your next shoot?
I wanna come and watch.

800
00:54:07,294 --> 00:54:09,694
It's sold out. I mean, it's a closed set.

801
00:54:09,754 --> 00:54:12,015
Oh. Well, I'm sure you can get me in.

802
00:54:12,255 --> 00:54:13,175
I doubt it.

803
00:54:15,175 --> 00:54:17,977
This place is such a mess.
I can't stand for you to see it like this.

804
00:54:17,977 --> 00:54:19,858
What are you talking about? This is spotless.

805
00:54:21,218 --> 00:54:25,979
Joe?? Joe, what is the matter?
Aren't you glad to see me?

806
00:54:26,259 --> 00:54:27,740
Haven't you missed me?

807
00:54:29,861 --> 00:54:32,022
You have no idea how much I've missed you, Lise.

808
00:54:32,462 --> 00:54:36,422
- I've almost forgotten how beautiful you are.
- Oh, Joe.

809
00:54:45,746 --> 00:54:47,387
- Hello.
- Shut up.

810
00:54:47,467 --> 00:54:48,987
How you doin', A-Cup?

811
00:54:49,027 --> 00:54:50,828
Fuck you!

812
00:54:51,868 --> 00:54:55,310
Hey! Come here.

813
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:57,190
Come here.

814
00:55:07,033 --> 00:55:09,074
Now get the fuck out of here!

815
00:55:10,074 --> 00:55:10,914
Action!

816
00:55:11,075 --> 00:55:13,875
I should have known you'd team up
with Neutered Man, Lobstra!

817
00:55:13,915 --> 00:55:15,596
That's right, Choda Boy!

818
00:55:15,716 --> 00:55:19,356
And if you don't tell me where Orgazmo is, I'll...

819
00:55:20,556 --> 00:55:22,438
... screw you to death!

820
00:55:23,079 --> 00:55:25,319
I'd like to see you try!

821
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:26,799
All right.

822
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,480
Just let me get out of these clothes...

823
00:55:39,484 --> 00:55:40,664
Where do you want me?

824
00:55:41,084 --> 00:55:43,365
You're not in the shot yet.

825
00:55:44,005 --> 00:55:45,685
Oh. Oh. Sorry.

826
00:55:46,685 --> 00:55:47,287
Stop it!

827
00:55:48,687 --> 00:55:51,368
- Stop grabbing my ass!
- Momm, baby.

828
00:55:51,408 --> 00:55:53,948
- Knock it off! We're not rolling!
- I'd say we are!

829
00:55:55,008 --> 00:55:57,369
- Hey hey hey, leave her alone.
- Don't you fuckin' tell me what to do!

830
00:55:57,409 --> 00:55:58,929
Just leave her alone.
You don't have any right to...

831
00:56:06,973 --> 00:56:08,933
Oh yeah??? You want some?

832
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:11,400
- You want some of me?
- Hey hey heyhey! Hey HEY hey hey hey!

833
00:56:13,074 --> 00:56:16,216
A-Cup, look what you did here.

834
00:56:16,256 --> 00:56:18,616
He's supposed to work in the next scene.

835
00:56:18,656 --> 00:56:20,777
I'm sorry, Uncle Orbison. He provoked me.

836
00:56:20,817 --> 00:56:23,557
The both of you two better stop scrappin' or else...

837
00:56:23,557 --> 00:56:26,299
... you'll be sleepin' with the fishes. See?

838
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,260
Merry Christmas.

839
00:56:33,501 --> 00:56:37,422
- He totally started it, Mr. Orbison. I...
- Just get to make-up, Hung.

840
00:56:39,463 --> 00:56:40,584
Are you okay?

841
00:56:41,424 --> 00:56:45,585
Yeah. Thanks for trying to help, Joe.
You know, he kinda really hurt me.

842
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:50,466
Action.

843
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:51,800
Oh, yeah.

844
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:52,900
Oh, no!

845
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Oh, yeah.

846
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,100
Oh, no.

847
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:57,469
Do something, Choda Dog!

848
00:56:58,709 --> 00:57:01,550
Quickly, Choda Dog. Bite through these ropes!

849
00:57:24,518 --> 00:57:26,798
Thanks, Choda Boy.
That's just what I need.

850
00:57:26,838 --> 00:57:27,518
Joe?

851
00:57:27,558 --> 00:57:30,879
What has Jizzmaster Zero done
with the little fat retarded kid from Boise?

852
00:57:30,919 --> 00:57:32,241
I don't know.

853
00:57:32,281 --> 00:57:34,361
We must find Jizzmaster Zero!

854
00:57:34,721 --> 00:57:36,001
Here they come, Choda Boy! Duck.

855
00:57:40,002 --> 00:57:42,523
Excuse me. What movie is this?

856
00:57:42,723 --> 00:57:45,845
What movie is this?
Have you been living in a cardboard box, lady?

857
00:57:45,885 --> 00:57:47,365
No, I'm from Utah.

858
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,846
Oh. I'm sorry.

859
00:57:52,527 --> 00:57:56,808
Joe, Joe, these are two of the
hottest porn stars in Japan.

860
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:59,489
Natsuko and Haruko.

861
00:57:59,929 --> 00:58:01,890
- Hi!
- How do you do?

862
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:05,971
Natsuko, you go sit over here.
Right on the bed. Very good.

863
00:58:05,971 --> 00:58:08,412
And Haruko, you sit right here, darling.

864
00:58:09,132 --> 00:58:11,333
Now, when we roll cameras,...

865
00:58:11,373 --> 00:58:16,214
... Natsuko, you say:
"There is no escaping us, Orgazmo."

866
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:20,816
There iz no escaping us, Orugazmo?

867
00:58:20,856 --> 00:58:25,498
Good. And Haruko, you say:
"Prepare to meet your doom!"

868
00:58:25,538 --> 00:58:29,339
Prepare da meet zou doom!

869
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:31,579
Good. Close enough.

870
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:33,660
Joe, you say:

871
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:37,142
"I'll find a way to break free, Assfuck Twins!"

872
00:58:37,182 --> 00:58:41,023
I'll find a way to bre...! Oh...
Ah, wuh. I... I can't say that.

873
00:58:41,063 --> 00:58:42,703
- Say what?
- What are they called?

874
00:58:42,743 --> 00:58:44,023
The Assfuck Twins.

875
00:58:43,943 --> 00:58:46,944
I can't say that. Can we call 'em something else?

876
00:58:46,984 --> 00:58:48,544
But they're the Assfuck Twins.

877
00:58:48,584 --> 00:58:52,466
Well I know, but... couldn't I call them
the Naughty Twins or something?

878
00:58:52,747 --> 00:58:57,508
No, you couldn't just call them the Naughty Twins.
They're the Assfuck Twins.

879
00:58:57,748 --> 00:58:60,248
Why would you call them the Naughty Twins when...

880
00:58:60,488 --> 00:59:02,389
... they get fucked in the ass all the time?

881
00:59:02,549 --> 00:59:04,150
Well, that's pretty naughty.

882
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:08,872
Look Hung! I've been pretty patient
with you, but it's wearing thin!

883
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:12,232
Now my need to kiss your ass is over!

884
00:59:12,472 --> 00:59:16,073
So you'd better shape up, kiddo. Understood?!

885
00:59:16,434 --> 00:59:17,635
Yes sir.

886
00:59:18,035 --> 00:59:20,916
Okay. Let's shoot this.

887
00:59:22,556 --> 00:59:23,676
Roll camera.

888
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:29,439
And action!

889
00:59:31,759 --> 00:59:35,600
There is no escaping us, Orugazmo.

890
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:39,541
Prepare da meet zor doom!

891
00:59:39,781 --> 00:59:41,682
I'll find a way to break free,...

892
00:59:42,443 --> 00:59:44,203
... A... assfucktwins!

893
00:59:47,764 --> 00:59:49,845
Get away from him, Assfuck Twins!

894
00:59:49,885 --> 00:59:52,725
- Chodai Bo!
- That's right!

895
00:59:52,865 --> 00:59:54,506
Let's see how you like my...

896
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,000

897
00:59:59,168 --> 01:00:00,768
Cock rocket!

01:00:10,472 --> 01:00:13,253
Cut cut cut! God-damnit cut!!

899
01:00:13,373 --> 01:00:16,173
You call that an explosing, Chapleski?!

900
01:00:16,573 --> 01:00:18,454
I told you to make it bigger!

901
01:00:18,494 --> 01:00:22,056
All right, mellow out, I'll make it bigger. Jesus.

902
01:00:22,096 --> 01:00:22,816
Where?

903
01:00:23,856 --> 01:00:27,217
The both of you two assholes get off of my set!!

904
01:00:27,737 --> 01:00:32,018
We'll just shoot the fucking sex!
Bring me my stunt cock!

905
01:00:32,578 --> 01:00:35,100
- Stunt cock.
- Stunt cock.

906
01:00:37,581 --> 01:00:38,581
Hey, how're you doin'?

907
01:00:39,581 --> 01:00:41,181
Just get in there and fuck.

908
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:44,942
- I haven't slapped my ass yet.
- Move, fuck boy!

909
01:00:50,985 --> 01:00:52,605
Assfuck Twins!! Wooo!!

910
01:00:53,786 --> 01:00:56,066
Boy, I've never seen Mr. Orbison like that.

911
01:00:56,306 --> 01:01:00,907
Well he's a first-class asshole, that's for sure.
See ya tomorrow.

912
01:01:00,987 --> 01:01:01,629
Good night.

913
01:01:05,209 --> 01:01:07,350
- Oh. Hey, Joe.
- Oh. Hi Dave.

914
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:10,771
- You know, you did a good job in there today, man.
- Thanks. Thanks, man.

915
01:01:10,771 --> 01:01:12,851
You know, I don't wanna sound
like a queer or nothin',...

916
01:01:12,991 --> 01:01:15,213
... but I kinda wanna make love to you tonight.

917
01:01:19,694 --> 01:01:21,194
Goodbye, Choda Boy.

918
01:01:21,234 --> 01:01:23,275
'Night. Whoa, excuse me.

919
01:01:23,975 --> 01:01:26,296
Ey Boss, this guy looks really familiar.

920
01:01:26,996 --> 01:01:29,998
'Course he looks familiar.
He's Choda Boy in the film.

921
01:01:30,838 --> 01:01:34,639
Oh yeah, that's right. Choda Boy. Good stuff.

922
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:37,799
- You work for Orbison?
- Is there a problem, Chapleski?

923
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:44,282
No... There's no problem. Excuse me.

924
01:01:46,003 --> 01:01:47,523
Hi Cupcake, I'm home.

925
01:01:48,403 --> 01:01:51,204
- Orgazmo!
- And Choda Boy!

926
01:01:51,804 --> 01:01:53,565
I'll use my Orgazmorator.

927
01:01:55,006 --> 01:01:55,966
Nice shot!

928
01:01:58,087 --> 01:02:02,127
- Ah... How's it going?
- Joe, how could you?

929
01:02:04,248 --> 01:02:05,448
Lisa, listen to me.

930
01:02:05,728 --> 01:02:08,370
You had your heart so set on
being married in the Temple and,...

931
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:11,551
... and having a nice place to live and...
I wanted to have it all for you.

932
01:02:11,551 --> 01:02:14,111
But you had to know that I didn't want this.

933
01:02:16,773 --> 01:02:20,414
I... it all happened so fast, Lise. But bu...

934
01:02:20,414 --> 01:02:22,655
Fie on you, Satan!

935
01:02:25,895 --> 01:02:28,616
Lise, I... I thought nobody would ever know.

936
01:02:28,656 --> 01:02:30,537
I had no idea it would get this popular.

937
01:02:30,577 --> 01:02:33,418
How could you have sex
with all of those women??

938
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,939
I didn't have sex with them.
It was a stunt cock.

939
01:02:37,999 --> 01:02:40,400
A stunt... cock?

940
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:41,700
Yeah.

941
01:02:42,461 --> 01:02:48,543
So... So you...aren't actually touching
those women's... breasts?

942
01:02:49,623 --> 01:02:52,804
Oh... no, that's all just... special effects.

943
01:02:53,284 --> 01:02:54,524
Really?

944
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,200
No.

945
01:02:58,025 --> 01:02:59,747
Lisa, I love you.

946
01:03:00,087 --> 01:03:03,108
And... and I did this all for you and... for us.

947
01:03:03,148 --> 01:03:06,228
Hey, is this what you think
Heavenly Father has intended for you??

948
01:03:08,149 --> 01:03:11,710
I don't know, Lisa. All I know is that
I'm finally good at something.

949
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:13,511
You have to quit, Joe.

950
01:03:13,911 --> 01:03:17,232
You have to quit, right now,
and get back to Utah.

951
01:03:17,472 --> 01:03:19,713
I can't quit, Lisa, we're still shooting.

952
01:03:19,633 --> 01:03:21,453
But, ehp, what about me?

953
01:03:22,033 --> 01:03:26,996
Lisa, it's two more days. Two more days of shooting,
and then we'll have all the money we need.

954
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:30,076
I don't want the money if
this is how you have to earn it!

955
01:03:30,076 --> 01:03:31,757
Well, I don't know how else I can earn it!

956
01:03:31,757 --> 01:03:33,417
Joe, it is wrong!

957
01:03:33,417 --> 01:03:35,798
Will you just stop hollerin' at me?! Criminy!

958
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,321
I guess we don't have anything else to say.

959
01:03:53,944 --> 01:03:55,885
I don't know what's happened to you, Joe.

960
01:03:57,345 --> 01:03:58,445
But...

961
01:03:59,145 --> 01:04:01,446
... I hope you're happy
in the life you've chosen.

962
01:04:01,726 --> 01:04:03,607
Don't quote Dickens in my apartment!

963
01:04:10,049 --> 01:04:12,470
That's right. My house.

964
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:18,753
Oooo! Come on now! Come on, baby!
Oh-oh yeah! Spank that ass now!

965
01:04:18,753 --> 01:04:25,500
Come on! Come on! Move that ass, baby!
Woo! Ohh yeah! Oh, that's a baby now!

966
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,255
Lisa.

967
01:04:26,255 --> 01:04:29,035
Oh, you feel so good inside me, baby!

968
01:04:29,035 --> 01:04:30,100
Lisa!

969
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,777
Lis... LISA!!

970
01:04:32,777 --> 01:04:38,978
Use your little foam here! That's right, baby! Come on!
Give it to momma now! Give it to momma now!

971
01:04:38,978 --> 01:04:40,339
Awww, heck!

972
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:43,179
- What's your name again?
- I am Sancho.

973
01:04:43,219 --> 01:04:45,701
Look, I get a lot of people
auditioning all the time.

974
01:04:45,741 --> 01:04:47,782
What makes you think
you'd be good at porno?

975
01:04:48,422 --> 01:04:49,362
I am Sancho.

976
01:04:50,462 --> 01:04:53,503
That's great, but... What do you do?

977
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:56,664
What do I do? I am Sancho.

978
01:04:57,765 --> 01:04:58,665
And?

979
01:04:58,705 --> 01:05:02,946
And there are many... Jeffs in the world,
and many Toms as well.

980
01:05:03,907 --> 01:05:05,107
But I...

981
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,100
... am Sancho.

982
01:05:07,668 --> 01:05:08,788
And??

983
01:05:08,828 --> 01:05:12,510
Are you Sancho? No, you are not Sancho.

984
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:14,750
Neither is Scott Baio Sancho.

985
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:16,951
Frank Gifford is not Sancho.

986
01:05:18,311 --> 01:05:19,071
But I...

987
01:05:19,271 --> 01:05:22,912
- You... are Sancho!
- That's right.

988
01:05:24,394 --> 01:05:26,314
- Okay, you're hired.
- Of course.

989
01:05:26,874 --> 01:05:29,915
You get a hundred bucks a scene.
We're shooting one tonight.

990
01:05:29,955 --> 01:05:34,496
It's on the volcano set,
with the Assfuck Twins.

991
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:36,900
Yeah?

992
01:05:36,958 --> 01:05:39,879
Boss, Joe Young is here to see you.
He says it's very important.

993
01:05:39,879 --> 01:05:42,719
God-damnit. Send him in.

994
01:05:47,781 --> 01:05:50,362
Whattaya want, Hung? I'm very very busy.

995
01:05:50,382 --> 01:05:53,803
Well, Mr. Orbison, I just came by
to tell you that... I have to quit.

996
01:05:54,523 --> 01:05:56,244
Oh my God, it's Orgazmo!

997
01:05:56,284 --> 01:05:58,284
- I am not Orgazmo!
- I am Sancho.

998
01:05:58,324 --> 01:06:02,385
You, you see, Mr. Orbison, my my fiancée came in
from out of town and everything just...

999
01:06:02,486 --> 01:06:06,247
... well... dangit,... I just have to
get back to Utah and marry her!

1000
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:08,968
Get outta here! I'll see ya on set tomorrow.

1001
01:06:09,688 --> 01:06:11,248
No, I'm serious. I...

1002
01:06:11,568 --> 01:06:14,249
I appreciate everything you've done
for me, but, I have to say no.

1003
01:06:15,129 --> 01:06:17,691
My contract does state that
I can leave whenever I want.

1004
01:06:18,551 --> 01:06:21,052
- Wait a minute, kid, you're forgetting something.
- What?

1005
01:06:21,412 --> 01:06:24,573
That contracts don't mean shit to me.

1006
01:06:25,093 --> 01:06:28,174
Now you're gonna finish this film.
And then do you know what you're gonna do?

1007
01:06:28,094 --> 01:06:28,655
No.

1008
01:06:29,055 --> 01:06:32,496
You're gonna do Orgazmo 3.
Orgazmo 4, Orgazmo 5,...

1009
01:06:32,536 --> 01:06:35,496
... Orgazmo Twenty-fucking-Seven
if I want you to,...

1010
01:06:35,536 --> 01:06:37,817
... and do you know why?!

1011
01:06:37,817 --> 01:06:38,657
No.

1012
01:06:38,737 --> 01:06:43,200
Because I'm Maxxx Orbison!
And I get what I want!!

1013
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,820
Now... Now hold on a minute, Mr. Orbison!
I said I don't wanna do it!

1014
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:48,901
And you don't... you don't... own me!

1015
01:06:48,941 --> 01:06:51,181
You wanna bet I don't punk?!!!

1016
01:06:51,501 --> 01:06:55,583
Now I'm warnin' you, kid!
Don't fuck with me!

1017
01:06:56,464 --> 01:06:59,864
Now you go home and you tell your
little fiancée that the wedding is off...

1018
01:06:59,904 --> 01:07:04,225
... and you have your ass...
back here tomorrow a.m.!

1019
01:07:04,925 --> 01:07:10,908
Or else, you'll be sleeping
with the fishes. See?

1020
01:07:13,349 --> 01:07:15,309
Send in the next audition.

1021
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:21,192
You know? I have had enough
of your poo, Mr. Orbison!

1022
01:07:21,592 --> 01:07:23,432
Find yourself another Orgazmo!

1023
01:07:23,712 --> 01:07:26,473
- I'm warning you, Hung!
- Good-bye!

1024
01:07:29,474 --> 01:07:32,354
Not so fast, happy-pants.

1025
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:37,957
No. No! It's his decision. Let him go.

1026
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:47,440
You shoulda let me whoop his ass, uncle Orbison!

1027
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:50,301
No, we don't need him all messed up
for the shoot tomorrow.

1028
01:07:52,121 --> 01:07:53,882
There's another way.

1029
01:08:01,725 --> 01:08:02,625
Joe?

1030
01:08:03,885 --> 01:08:05,286
Joe? It's me.

1031
01:08:06,526 --> 01:08:09,207
Joe, come on!
Can we please just talk about this some more?

1032
01:08:13,328 --> 01:08:14,649
- Joe.
- Hi, Ben.

1033
01:08:14,729 --> 01:08:16,609
Man, I just tried callin' ya,
I got some big news!

1034
01:08:16,609 --> 01:08:19,370
No, nono, I've got big news, too.
I just quit.

1035
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:20,170
What??

1036
01:08:20,490 --> 01:08:24,651
I'm going back to Utah to be a normal
Mormon again. I just... came to say good-bye.

1037
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:28,533
I found out who's been beating up G-Fresh.
It's Orbison.

1038
01:08:29,334 --> 01:08:30,854
Those thugs work for him, Joe.

1039
01:08:31,934 --> 01:08:36,110
Orbison, wow. Boy, that guy just thinks
he owns the world, doesn't he?

1040
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:39,817
Yeah he does. And that's why you
and I need to do something.

1041
01:08:39,817 --> 01:08:43,938
Oh nononononono! Look, I might have lost
the only thing that really matters to me!

1042
01:08:43,978 --> 01:08:45,979
I'm...
I'm not staying in this town another hour!

1043
01:08:45,979 --> 01:08:49,460
Hey, you're gonna let Orbison extort money
from somebody like G-Fresh?

1044
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:51,340
Listen to me Joe!!

1045
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:51,380
No no! You...

1046
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:53,822
- You need to...
- No, no! You listen to me, Ben!

1047
01:08:54,142 --> 01:08:57,102
I don't know when exactly I lost control
of my life, but I want it back!

1048
01:08:57,703 --> 01:08:59,663
No, wait a minute. See?
Now you're doin' what they told ya!

1049
01:08:59,663 --> 01:09:02,684
Dog-gonnit Ben! I'm not a superhero!

1050
01:09:02,784 --> 01:09:04,024
I'm a Latter-Day Saint!

1051
01:09:15,548 --> 01:09:16,428
Lisa?

1052
01:09:25,592 --> 01:09:26,312
Hello?

1053
01:09:26,352 --> 01:09:28,672
- Joe? Joe, help me!
- Lisa? Whe...?

1054
01:09:28,672 --> 01:09:29,600
Joe! Joe!

1055
01:09:30,753 --> 01:09:33,154
I told you not to fuck with me, Hung!

1056
01:09:33,654 --> 01:09:34,555
What have you done with her?!

1057
01:09:34,595 --> 01:09:37,996
I'm gonna send her away so you
don't have to worry about her for a while!

1058
01:09:38,156 --> 01:09:40,476
Now you be on set tomorrow a.m.!

1059
01:09:40,716 --> 01:09:44,517
Or else I'm not gonna send her away,
I'm gonna blow her away!

1060
01:09:45,157 --> 01:09:47,279
Do you understand what I mean?!

1061
01:09:47,959 --> 01:09:50,480
You mean she'll be sleeping
with the fishes, see?

1062
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,520
That's right.
Now you just finish this film,...

1063
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:56,201
... then we'll see about getting
you two lovebirds back together!

1064
01:09:56,841 --> 01:09:57,641
Don't hurt... err...

1065
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,400
Her.

1066
01:10:09,886 --> 01:10:11,967
What should we do with her, boss, huh?

1067
01:10:13,847 --> 01:10:15,368
We need some collateral.

1068
01:10:17,168 --> 01:10:19,289
Twins! Take a break.

1069
01:10:19,849 --> 01:10:22,250
Put her... on the set!

1070
01:10:24,571 --> 01:10:25,932
Joe! The hell you doin'?

1071
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:29,052
He took her, Ben! Orbison took my cupcake!

1072
01:10:29,452 --> 01:10:31,973
Shit. I knew it would come to this!

1073
01:10:31,973 --> 01:10:33,813
Where's the Orgazmorator?
I have to get her back!

1074
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:37,174
Whoa. Hold on! Listen: Orbison's
mansion is like a fortress, Joe!

1075
01:10:37,174 --> 01:10:38,576
There's no way you can do this by yourself!

1076
01:10:38,576 --> 01:10:40,656
I know. That's why I need you.

1077
01:10:40,976 --> 01:10:42,817
Damn, Joe. I've never seen you like this.

1078
01:10:43,897 --> 01:10:45,337
I'm pissed off!

1079
01:10:45,977 --> 01:10:49,258
- Help meeee!!
- Will you shut up?!

1080
01:10:49,978 --> 01:10:53,700
You pig! You're the one responsible
for degrading all of those women!

1081
01:10:53,861 --> 01:10:56,941
Hey hey! What about men, huh?
He degrades them too!

1082
01:10:56,941 --> 01:10:59,702
Yeah. Men are equally degraded
in pornographic films.

1083
01:10:59,742 --> 01:11:01,782
The men are always in a position of power!

1084
01:11:01,822 --> 01:11:05,544
The men are the ones who want the product so bad.
They're the victims!

1085
01:11:05,584 --> 01:11:08,905
Well, then, it exploits men
by exploiting women.

1086
01:11:09,385 --> 01:11:11,986
Hence... it exploits... people.

1087
01:11:12,346 --> 01:11:13,426
Shut up!!

1088
01:11:13,586 --> 01:11:14,427
Yeah!

1089
01:11:14,787 --> 01:11:17,228
I do what I do and I make a lot of money!

1090
01:11:17,348 --> 01:11:21,349
And I don't give a shit what I do
to people because they're all idiots!

1091
01:11:21,349 --> 01:11:22,149
Yeah!

1092
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:26,431
Especially you, Clark.
You pig-fucking hunk o' shit!

1093
01:11:26,711 --> 01:11:27,511
Yeah!

1094
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:30,112
Men like you make the Lord sick!

1095
01:11:31,153 --> 01:11:33,473
Jesus is gonna put an end to you!

1096
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:39,755
If Jesus Christ wants
to bring Maxxx Orbison down...

1097
01:11:40,795 --> 01:11:43,037
... he's gonna need a lot of help!

1098
01:11:44,397 --> 01:11:46,878
- Wait! To the Orgazmobile!
- What?

1099
01:11:46,998 --> 01:11:48,598
My Buick Century!

1100
01:12:02,542 --> 01:12:07,004
"He sent his son to die for me."

1101
01:12:07,344 --> 01:12:10,045
"He didn't have to do that."

1102
01:12:10,085 --> 01:12:11,646
Man, this shit has got to go!

1103
01:12:16,407 --> 01:12:19,088
You'd better hope your little
boyfriend finishes my film,...

1104
01:12:19,128 --> 01:12:22,168
... or else I'm gonna release this instead.

1105
01:12:22,609 --> 01:12:25,730
I think we should start
with a close-up of my ass.

1106
01:12:27,811 --> 01:12:30,611
Welcome to Hollywood!

1107
01:12:36,214 --> 01:12:38,494
We can't go through the main gate,
or we'll be spotted.

1108
01:12:38,814 --> 01:12:40,515
Can you climb the wall
with that thing on?

1109
01:12:40,895 --> 01:12:43,316
- I'll sure as Abraham try.
- Right.

1110
01:12:51,219 --> 01:12:53,219
Come on! Get that camera up!

1111
01:12:53,259 --> 01:12:55,620
Don't yell at me!
I'm not used to working like this.

1112
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:58,260
Man, these European videos are kinky!

1113
01:13:04,863 --> 01:13:06,263
- This should be a cake!
- Yeah.

1114
01:13:08,164 --> 01:13:10,164
Aw, shit! Back over the wall!

1115
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:12,600
Joe!

1116
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:17,600
Oh...

1117
01:13:19,348 --> 01:13:21,469
Oh. Hey.

1118
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:22,800
Oh.

1119
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,169
Bad dog.

1120
01:13:25,129 --> 01:13:26,889
I didn't know it worked on animals.

1121
01:13:27,231 --> 01:13:29,631
Ben, could...?
Could you give me a hand here, Ben?

1122
01:13:30,631 --> 01:13:31,832
Bad dog! Shoo!

1123
01:13:32,632 --> 01:13:35,052
That's a bad dog! Oh.

1124
01:13:35,232 --> 01:13:36,633
That's fucked up.

1125
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:38,313
Okay, I'm ready.

1126
01:13:38,673 --> 01:13:42,835
Finally. Okay, people,
let's do this. Roll camera.

1127
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,720
- Drop him.
- Right.

1128
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:04,900
Hey!

1129
01:14:05,122 --> 01:14:06,342
This is private property!

1130
01:14:06,482 --> 01:14:08,364
Where is the woman you kidnapped?

1131
01:14:09,724 --> 01:14:10,484
Hung?

1132
01:14:12,645 --> 01:14:13,825
Hung, is that you?

1133
01:14:14,365 --> 01:14:16,846
Don't you think you're taking
this role a little bit too seriously?

1134
01:14:17,046 --> 01:14:18,766
Where's my fiancée, buttlord?!

1135
01:14:18,806 --> 01:14:21,328
Let's just say your fiancée is getting
an education in the industry.

1136
01:14:21,368 --> 01:14:23,408
Yeah, she's gonna be a star, just like you.

1137
01:14:24,209 --> 01:14:25,609
You dirty so-and-so!

1138
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:31,890
I've been waiting for this.

1139
01:14:34,452 --> 01:14:35,892
Son of a bitch!

1140
01:14:44,655 --> 01:14:45,455
Need a hand?

1141
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,300
Excuse me?

1142
01:14:52,218 --> 01:14:55,018
You dirty girl.
I can do that.

1143
01:14:55,758 --> 01:14:57,459
- Yoktuki!
- Woh!

1144
01:15:01,621 --> 01:15:04,022
Jong kwang doh!

1145
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,500
Hoh?

1146
01:15:26,789 --> 01:15:27,589
No problem.

1147
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:33,600
You twerp!

1148
01:15:41,074 --> 01:15:42,114
Now I got ya!

1149
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:01,820
Sayonara!

1150
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,700
Ohhh, shit!

1151
01:16:13,684 --> 01:16:14,700
Who are you?

1152
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,304
I am Sancho.

1153
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,100
Me estoy mojando.

1154
01:16:26,588 --> 01:16:27,728
Shit, dude.

1155
01:16:30,189 --> 01:16:31,250
Get off of me!

1156
01:16:33,611 --> 01:16:35,851
Boss! We got a problem! He's here!

1157
01:16:35,851 --> 01:16:37,012
Who's here?

1158
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:39,412
Orgazmo. The real Orgazmo!

1159
01:16:39,572 --> 01:16:42,793
There is no real Orgazmo, you dipshit.

1160
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:48,095
Let the woman go! Right now!

1161
01:16:48,595 --> 01:16:50,136
Who the hell are you??

1162
01:16:50,296 --> 01:16:52,216
I said, let her go!

1163
01:16:52,296 --> 01:16:53,977
Get this fuck!

1164
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,500
Show me what you got.
I'm right here. Come on!

1165
01:17:12,904 --> 01:17:15,704
Oh yeah? You think you can do some
of that piece of shit on me, man??

1166
01:17:27,828 --> 01:17:30,709
Get up here. I'm gonna whup your ass!

1167
01:17:30,749 --> 01:17:32,609
And then I'm gonna rape your girlfriend!

1168
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,600
Lisa!

1169
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:42,800
Joe!

1170
01:17:43,113 --> 01:17:44,913
Now it's your turn, Johnny!

1171
01:17:54,817 --> 01:17:57,357
Hawgh, you sonofabitch! Oh!

1172
01:18:15,423 --> 01:18:16,323
Ben!

1173
01:18:16,823 --> 01:18:18,405
Use your hamster style!

1174
01:18:18,765 --> 01:18:19,965
No! I can't!

1175
01:18:22,086 --> 01:18:24,406
Hamster style, Ben. Do it!

1176
01:18:24,786 --> 01:18:25,847
No!!

1177
01:18:29,248 --> 01:18:30,109
Hey Dad?

1178
01:18:31,049 --> 01:18:33,930
I don't think I'm going to do
hamster-style anymore.

1179
01:18:35,930 --> 01:18:36,690
That's nice.

1180
01:18:39,171 --> 01:18:39,971
That's nice.

1181
01:18:40,811 --> 01:18:41,652
That's nice.

1182
01:18:42,733 --> 01:18:43,413
That's nice.

1183
01:19:19,544 --> 01:19:21,184
You're an asshole!

1184
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:36,150
Easy shot.

1185
01:19:41,551 --> 01:19:43,892
Oh shit! We're out of battery power!

1186
01:19:43,992 --> 01:19:44,512
What??

1187
01:19:44,512 --> 01:19:48,834
Hohoh! It looks like you're
up Fucked River now, ey kiddo?!

1188
01:19:50,455 --> 01:19:52,475
One more step and I'll slice her.

1189
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:54,700
No!!!

1190
01:19:54,856 --> 01:19:58,717
Did you really think you could
beat me, you cocky prick?!

1191
01:19:58,757 --> 01:20:02,399
Did you really think that a stupid
little twerp like you...

1192
01:20:02,439 --> 01:20:04,679
... could stop Maxxx Orbison?!

1193
01:20:05,759 --> 01:20:08,240
You've done a lot of
fucking damage here, pal!

1194
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,801
And you're gonna pay me back
every cent of it!

1195
01:20:10,961 --> 01:20:12,881
Please, Mr. Orbison. Don't hurt her.

1196
01:20:13,361 --> 01:20:18,083
I told you not to fuck with me!!
What did I say?

1197
01:20:18,404 --> 01:20:20,364
That I'd be sleeping with the fishes, see?

1198
01:20:20,764 --> 01:20:22,204
That's right.

1199
01:20:22,565 --> 01:20:24,445
I own this town!

1200
01:20:24,645 --> 01:20:28,607
I'm the... mayor, I'm the governor,
I'm the police and the crime!

1201
01:20:29,007 --> 01:20:32,608
AND WHO THE HELL ARE YOU TO CHANGE THAT?!!

1202
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:34,700
Got it!

1203
01:20:36,969 --> 01:20:38,289
I'm Orgazmo.

1204
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:40,471
What?

1205
01:20:59,617 --> 01:21:00,517
No!

1206
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:03,178
He's never gonna have an orgasm again.

1207
01:21:05,978 --> 01:21:07,180
One more for Jesus.

1208
01:21:14,181 --> 01:21:16,382
Looks like he's sleeping with the fishes.

1209
01:21:16,882 --> 01:21:17,742
See?

1210
01:21:20,864 --> 01:21:24,865
Lisa? Are you okay? Did he hurt you?
What? Oh, I'm sorry. Here.

1211
01:21:28,086 --> 01:21:30,656
Oh, Lisa, I'm sorry.
What were you trying to say?

1212
01:21:30,656 --> 01:21:33,047
- "Don't pull the tape off my mouth."
- Oh.

1213
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:34,828
Joe, I was so scared.

1214
01:21:34,788 --> 01:21:38,369
Oh, I know, Lise. I'm sorry, this is all my fault.
I... you were right, I was wrong, and...

1215
01:21:38,369 --> 01:21:40,670
No wait, Joe, Joe. It's okay.

1216
01:21:43,931 --> 01:21:47,153
Oh, Lisa, this is... this is Choda Boy.
I... I mean... deh... Ben.

1217
01:21:47,193 --> 01:21:49,073
- Hello.
- Ma'am.

1218
01:21:49,073 --> 01:21:51,200
Oh... uh... Joe...

1219
01:21:51,594 --> 01:21:53,594
- I'll explain later, Lise.
- Right.

1220
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:06,358
There's one more thing, Orbi.
I did what you asked me.

1221
01:22:10,799 --> 01:22:14,121
Cock Rocket!!!

1222
01:22:25,605 --> 01:22:27,906
That's a heck of a cock rocket, Ben.

1223
01:22:28,606 --> 01:22:31,847
MARK MY WORDS: I'LL GET YOU FOR THIS!!!

1224
01:22:34,707 --> 01:22:37,448
This has really been
a learning experience for me.

1225
01:22:38,409 --> 01:22:41,210
...Yeah. I've learned
a lot about myself tonight.

1226
01:22:41,610 --> 01:22:45,091
Ben, I'm... sorry you had
to use your hamster style.

1227
01:22:47,211 --> 01:22:48,292
No, it's okay.

1228
01:22:50,452 --> 01:22:52,134
In fact, I think it's a good thing.

1229
01:22:54,414 --> 01:22:56,655
All these years I don't know what
I've been running from.

1230
01:22:58,615 --> 01:22:59,656
Maybe I've been running from my...

1231
01:22:59,656 --> 01:23:01,496
From yourself. Right.

1232
01:23:02,096 --> 01:23:02,816
Right.

1233
01:23:05,618 --> 01:23:07,779
Come on, Joe. Let's get out of here.

1234
01:23:08,319 --> 01:23:10,019
We don't have to explain this to the cops.

1235
01:23:10,019 --> 01:23:13,460
You're right. I think we've done enough
damage to this little operation anyway.

1236
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:15,380
Farewell, evildoers!

1237
01:23:21,043 --> 01:23:24,584
Whoa. Bummer, dude. What happened here?

1238
01:23:24,624 --> 01:23:26,984
Some superhero destroyed the house.

1239
01:23:27,425 --> 01:23:29,345
Oh. My name's Dave.

1240
01:23:29,425 --> 01:23:30,746
I am Sancho.

1241
01:23:32,627 --> 01:23:35,027
I don't mean to sound
like a queer or nothing,...

1242
01:23:35,547 --> 01:23:37,788
... but I think fire is very romantic.

1243
01:23:51,913 --> 01:23:53,953
This is the last of the bedroom stuff.

1244
01:23:54,293 --> 01:23:55,113
Oh, great.

1245
01:24:06,637 --> 01:24:09,278
- Hey kids.
- Hi Choda Boy.

1246
01:24:09,939 --> 01:24:11,279
All ready to leave, huh?

1247
01:24:11,639 --> 01:24:14,520
Yeah, I... I... uh... I guess so.

1248
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:20,922
So I... guess there's no more...
Orgazmo and Choda Boy.

1249
01:24:22,842 --> 01:24:24,844
No, I... I don't think so.

1250
01:24:25,044 --> 01:24:28,124
Well, maybe someday I can... come to Utah.

1251
01:24:29,845 --> 01:24:32,766
It was... it was really good
meeting you. Really good.

1252
01:24:32,806 --> 01:24:35,566
Yeah. There was a lot of
good stuff goin' on.

1253
01:24:36,728 --> 01:24:38,048
Whole lot of good stuff!

1254
01:24:38,088 --> 01:24:38,888
Good stuff.

1255
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,700
- Good, good stuff.
- Yeah.

1256
01:24:40,849 --> 01:24:43,249
A lot of stuff that...
makes you feel good.

1257
01:24:43,289 --> 01:24:44,109
It's good.

1258
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:46,400
God, Joe!

1259
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:49,932
Oh Joe, I can't let you do this.

1260
01:24:51,052 --> 01:24:52,492
Oh God!

1261
01:24:52,533 --> 01:24:55,133
Joe, this way is crazy,...

1262
01:24:55,853 --> 01:24:57,374
... but I think you might have been right.

1263
01:24:57,454 --> 01:24:58,114
What?

1264
01:24:58,114 --> 01:25:01,495
Oh, Joe, it is so hard to know what
Heavenly Father wants from us...

1265
01:25:01,535 --> 01:25:02,816
... or what He has in mind.

1266
01:25:03,256 --> 01:25:06,657
This whole thing is just too...
gosh-darned wacky to be coinkidink.

1267
01:25:07,957 --> 01:25:11,738
Maybe this is...
what Heavenly Father has intended for you.

1268
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,700
- Oh Lisa.
- Oh Joe!

1269
01:25:21,562 --> 01:25:23,342
Whoa! They're goin' crazy!

1270
01:25:28,985 --> 01:25:32,145
Ben, L.A. needs us. The world needs us. Heck...

1271
01:25:32,265 --> 01:25:34,066
... I think the whole universe needs us!

1272
01:25:34,106 --> 01:25:35,186
You mean you're gonna stay??

1273
01:25:35,266 --> 01:25:37,387
I think you guys need to clean up Los Angeles!

1274
01:25:38,667 --> 01:25:40,627
Well there's nothing that can stop us!

1275
01:25:40,667 --> 01:25:42,509
Well crime fighting will have a new name!

1276
01:25:42,549 --> 01:25:44,950
From now on, if someone
wants to turn to a life of crime,...

1277
01:25:44,990 --> 01:25:46,750
... he'll have to answer to Orgazmo!

1278
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:48,030
And Choda Boy!

1279
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:50,751
Ah, this is so wonderful! Let's pray.

1280
01:25:50,791 --> 01:25:52,471
Oh boy, look at the time! I've...

1281
01:25:52,511 --> 01:25:55,993
Now, Choda Boy, superheros
that pray together stay together.

1282
01:25:56,273 --> 01:25:57,554
Ah, what the fuck.

1283
01:25:59,274 --> 01:26:02,795
Heavenly Father, may we serve you
in the best way we know how.

1284
01:26:02,835 --> 01:26:04,595
May our decisions be rash,...

1285
01:26:04,635 --> 01:26:07,637
... may we do what's right.
And God bless us.

1286
01:26:08,277 --> 01:26:09,998
God bless us!

1287
01:26:10,878 --> 01:26:12,238
Every one!

1288
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:29,600
Choda Boy!

1289
01:26:39,087 --> 01:26:41,808
Well, Doc? How bad is it?

1290
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:44,048
It isn't good, Mr. Orbison.

1291
01:26:44,088 --> 01:26:46,890
There's a problem...
with your little guy.

1292
01:26:47,490 --> 01:26:49,110
What's wrong... with my little guy?

1293
01:26:49,291 --> 01:26:53,131
Well I'm afraid your testicles have
swollen to the size of Florida oranges.

1294
01:26:53,492 --> 01:26:55,572
Don't you think I noticed that?!

1295
01:26:56,652 --> 01:27:00,414
Tell me something I don't know,
you cocky prick!

1296
01:27:01,595 --> 01:27:04,015
We're gonna have to
amputate your... peepee.

1297
01:27:15,619 --> 01:27:18,140
I've got you now, Joe Young!

1298
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:22,100
Soon, you'll be meeting up with...

1299
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,601
... NEUTERED MAN!!!

1300
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:36,500
Hey!

1301
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:48,200
What makes a man?
Is it the power in his hands?

1302
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:51,800
Is his quest for glory?

1303
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:55,900
Give it all you've got
To fight to the top

1304
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:59,800
So we can know your story

1305
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,400
Now you're a man
A man, man, man

1306
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:07,000
Now you're a man
A manny, manny, man

1307
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:09,000
A man, man, man

1308
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:13,500
You are now a man
You're a man

1309
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:16,000
Now you're a man

1310
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:23,300
Live it, live it

1311
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:35,100
What makes a man?
Is it the woman in his arms?

1312
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:39,000
Just 'cause she has big titties?

1313
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:43,400
Or is it the way he fights every day?

1314
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:47,000
... No, it's probably the titties

1315
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:50,900
Now you're a man
A man, man, man

1316
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,600
Now you're a man-man
Man-man, man, man-man

1317
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:56,000
Now you're a man

1318
01:28:56,300 --> 01:29:01,000
M - A - N, man
Man, man-man, man

1319
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,700
Now you're a man

1320
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:42,200
Onward Latter-Day soldier

1321
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:46,350
Spread the Word of Christ

1322
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:51,300
And Heavenly Father's vision

1323
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:55,600
Of everybody being really nice

1324
01:29:55,900 --> 01:30:00,700
He sent his Son to die for me

1325
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,000
He didn't have to do that

1326
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:09,900
Onward Letter-Day soldier

1327
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:16,700
Spread the Word of Christ

1328
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:40,000
