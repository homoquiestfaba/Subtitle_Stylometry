00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:18,309
Hi. One ticket
for Alice Island, please?

3
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,644
One way or round-trip?

4
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,615
Round. Thank you.

10
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:31,484
I love the smell of books,
don't you?

11
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,921
They should make a perfume
of it.

12
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:39,192
Oh, the new Munro!
How is it?

13
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,192
It's for school.

14
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:42,527
I love Munro,

15
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,762
but the only time I have
for pleasure reading is

16
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,898
when I'm on vacation.

17
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,935
I work for Knightley Press.

18
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,569
I'm their new sales rep.

19
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,206
Uh-huh.

20
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:57,777
I'm here to meet
with A.J. Fikry actually.

21
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,790
[grunts, gasps]

22
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:15,693
[music ends]

00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,727
AJ:
Who the hell are you?

24
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:21,432
Hi. I'm... I'm Amelia Loman.

25
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,937
[AJ groans]

26
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:27,307
AMELIA:
Now, Mr. Fikry,

27
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,674
please ignore the cover.

28
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:33,277
This one
is my absolute favorite.

29
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,278
It is a memoir

30
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,281
by an eight-year-old
first-time writer.

31
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,852
I mean,
don't you just love that?

32
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:46,524
So, Leon Friedman got married
for the first time

33
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,358
at 78 years old.

34
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,394
And his bride died
three years later of cancer.

35
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,563
I know the descriptions sounds
pretty maudlin,

36
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,932
but the prose is precise

37
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,934
and funny, and

38
00:03:56,936 --> 00:04:00,271
I will admit
I wept uncontrollably

39
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:03,343
on the train from New York
to Providence.

40
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,309
I know that this might seem
like a small book,

41
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,577
but readers could fall in love
with this

42
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,380
the same way they fell in love
with "Angela's Ashes"

43
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,452
or "Tuesdays with Morrie."

44
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,956
Is something wrong?

45
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,590
AJ:
This is not for me.

46
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,625
That's exactly what I thought.

47
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,461
But if you just read the first
chapter there, you'll see...

48
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,929
AJ:
This is not for me.

49
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,466
Okay. But maybe for some
of your readers?

50
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,867
Mother's Day is right around
the corner.

51
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:33,539
AJ:
Not. For. Me.

52
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,908
No problem.

53
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,977
Okay, I'll just tell you
about something else.

54
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,548
AJ:
What is the point?

55
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,882
[chuckles]

56
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,350
Mr. Fikry...

57
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,453
it's true we don't really know
each other that well yet.

58
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,290
So, before I try to sell you
on anything else,

59
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,595
why don't you tell me
about what you like?

60
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,632
Like?

61
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,400
Yes.

62
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,038
I'd love to get a sense
of your taste.

63
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:09,409
How about I tell you
what I don't like?

64
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,712
Oh sure, why not?

65
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:19,050
I do not like post-modernism,
post-apocalyptic settings,

66
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:22,086
post-mortem narrators,
or magic realism.

67
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,954
I do not like children's books,

68
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,056
especially those with orphans,

69
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:28,526
and I prefer not to clutter
my shelves with young adult.

70
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,095
I am repulsed
by ghostwritten novels

71
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,830
by reality television stars,

72
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,665
celebrity picture books,
sports memoirs,

73
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,835
movie tie-in editions, and I
prefer not to stock series,

74
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,071
but the demands
of my pocketbooks require me to.

75
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:44,508
Above all, Ms. Loman,
I find slim literary memoirs

76
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,010
about little old men
whose little old wives

77
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,946
have died of cancer
to be absolutely intolerable.

78
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:53,050
No matter how well written
the sales rep claims they are.

79
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,586
No matter how many copies
you promise

80
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,890
I'll sell on Mother's Day.

81
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:01,794
Hmm.

82
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:04,562
Island Books is closing.

83
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:08,501
Please make your
non-existent purchases now.

00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,440
OLD FEMALE CUSTOMER:
Mr. Fikry.

86
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,910
Good evening, Miss Klock.

87
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,814

the toilet.

108
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,819
All right, Mr. Fikry.
Just tell me what happened.

109
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,721
Someone stole Tamerlane.

110
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:51,589
What's a Tamerlane?

111
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,292
It's a... a book.
It's a very valuable book.

112
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:56,927
Okay. To clarify,

113
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,829
someone shoplifted
a book from your store.

114
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:02,032
No, it's my book
from my personal collection.

115
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:06,270
It's an extremely
rare collection of poems

116
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,938
by Edgar Allan Poe.

117
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,306
So, its like your favorite book?

118
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,809
No, I don't even like it.
It's crap.

119
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,110
It's jejune crap.

120
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,678
I'm just trying
to understand here.

121
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,248
So, you don't like the book,
but it has sentimental value?

122
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,149
No sentimental value!

123
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:22,319
It's got great financial value.

124
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,388
I was planning to auction it off

125
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,322
in a couple of years

126
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:27,925
when the economy had had time
to improve.

127
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:31,695
Like I was planning
to close the shop

128
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,764
to retire on the proceeds.

129
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:34,965
If you don't mind me asking, why
did you

130
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,002
have that book at your house and
not in a bank vault?

131
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:42,172
I kept it in
a combination-locked glass case.

132
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,407
I thought it'd be safe enough.

133
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,843
So, did somebody break the case
or... or...

134
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,679
- AJ: No, I...
- Anyone know the combination?

135
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,780
Neither.

136
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:53,786
I wanted to get wasted
last night.

137
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,987
I took the book out
to look at it.

138
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,288
To look at it!

139
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,160
Poor excuse for company, I know.

140
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:03,761
[groans]

141
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,032
Who else knows about this book?

142
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,267
Everyone.

143
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,936
Like everyone.

144
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:15,406
My wife's sister Is may,
she teaches at the high school.

145
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,340
Sure, I know Is may.

146
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,079
Yeah, she... she worries
about me since Nic...

147
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,448
Anyway,

148
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,683
Is may thought it would be good

149
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,685
for business or educational
or some crap

150
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,823
if I put it on display
in the store.

151
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,690
So, I...

152
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,062
so, I put the case in the shop

153
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,463
all... all last summer.

154
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,900
So many people in the store.

155
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,201
[gasps]

156
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,406
- Mr. Fikry?
- I think I'm dying.

157
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,941
DR. ROSEN:
Mr. Fikry.

158
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:54,344
What you experienced today
was a panic attack.

159
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,814
It really felt like I was dying.

160
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:57,314
[chuckles]

161
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,850
Why don't you tell me
something about your lifestyle?

162
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:00,884
Best, uh.

163
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,052
[clears throat]

164
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,821
I'm 39 years old.

165
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,789
I'm not what you'd call
an alcoholic

166
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,357
but I like to drink
until I pass out

167
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,459
at least once a week.

168
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:12,029
I subsist on a diet
of frozen entrees.

169
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,798
I used to be a mediocre
long-distance runner,

170
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,968
but now I don't exercise at all.

171
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,502
I live alone

172
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:22,072
and I lack meaningful
personal relationships.

173
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:26,445
And since my wife died,
I hate my work.

174
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,248
You're going through a bear
of a time.

175
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,348
Start with exercise.

176
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,052
You'll feel better.

177
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,353
Okay.

178
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,956
[indistinct chatter]

179
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,993
Would you mind terribly?

180
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,093
I would be delighted.
What's your name?

181
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,496
Jill, like Jack and Jill
went up the hill.

182
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,964
Macy, like the store.

183
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,398
[Daniel chuckles]

184
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,136
I've read all your books,
but I like this one the best.

185
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,371
Well, that is
the popular opinion,

186
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,839
Jill from the Hill.

187
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:56,974
[chuckles]

188
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,876
I can't even express
how much it meant to me.

189
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,245
It's what made me
want to be a nurse.

190
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,246
Hm.

191
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,783
Dan,

192
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,283
I thought your wife was coming.

193
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,554
Hey, Is may wasn't feeling well.

194
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:10,988
How're you holding up, old man?

195
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,560
I've lost my fortune, and the
doctor says I'm going to die.

196
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,828
Let's get drinks, yeah.

197
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,431
Hm.

198
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,167
Ooh, I love your outfit.

199
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,069
I'll... seriously
I love your outfit!

200
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:26,804
[chuckles]

201
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,406
I mean, come on, did you see
that? That's ridiculous.

202
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,177
Yeah, I did.

203
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,177
Poe's a lousy writer, you know?

204
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,379
And 'Tamerlane', it's the worst.

205
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,947
It's a boring
Lord Bryon rip off.

206
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,082
It'd be one thing
if it was a first edition

207
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,251
of something decent, but...

208
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,586
I think you'd be glad
to get rid of it.

209
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,889
You know I absolutely loathe
collectible books.

210
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:50,961
And people getting all moony
over particular paper carcasses.

211
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,563
It's about the ideas, man.

212
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,898
The words. Huh?

213
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,900
You sir, are an idiot.

214
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,068
Hm.

215
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,572

Yeah, I'm with the Alice Island
Police Department.

218
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,880
We're looking for a copy

221
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,023
I've never used this stuff
before.

222
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,127
Someone get a vacuum.

223
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:25,229
Who would even want
an old book anyway?

224
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,597
Doesn't everyone read an E?

00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:31,969
[indistinct chatter over
police radio]

226
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,337
Am I a suspect?

227
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,007
No, but you are one
of his only friends.

228
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,042
I'm just trying to get a sense
of

229
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,945
A.J. Fikry's state of mind.

230
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,147
Well, I'd say, not good.

231
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,517
He's depressed
and he basically drinks himself

232
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,552
to unconsciousness every night.

233
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,121
People do strange things
when they're drunk.

234
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:54,458
I mean, he could have set
the book on fire.

235
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,626
Do you think he did that?

236
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,595
I'm a novelist, and so it my
business to consider

237
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,931
all possibilities,
not just probabilities.

238
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,233
For instance, in my New York
Times Best selling novel,

239
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,402
The Children in the Apple Tree,
the nurse character...

240
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,437
Wait! Is this a spoiler?

241
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,273
Oh, it's a small one,
but I'm making a point.

242
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,177
I may want to read it someday,
so...

243
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,446
Understood.

244
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,583

That's my maiden name.
Do I know you?

247
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,526
Uh, we went to school together.

248
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:33,365
We didn't really travel
in the same circles.

249
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,267
I'm Officer Lambiase.
Nick Lambiase.

250
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,636
Kids used to call me Nico.

251
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:40,237
Hm.

252
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:44,341
I was talking to your husband
about AJ Fikry about his book.

253
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,476
Well, I can't say
I'm terribly surprised.

254
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,245
- No?
- ISMAY: He's been quite careless

255
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,446
since my sister died.

256
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,215
And he isn't exactly nice
to people in town.

257
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,183
You mean he's got enemies?

258
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,986
ISMAY: I would just say he
doesn't have a lot of friends.

259
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,389
I worry about him.

260
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,059
Daniel and I both do.

261
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,359
When are you due?

262
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,961
January.

263
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,262
[chuckles]

264
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,730
I guess it's pretty obvious.

265
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,667
Well, you look great.

266
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,068
Wait!

267
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,604
Um, what do you think happened
to the book?

268
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:19,209
AJ blacks out when he drinks,
and he's very self destructive.

269
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,645
I don't know
maybe he was sleep walking and

270
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,016
tossed it into the ocean.

271
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,994
LAMBIASE:
Book's gone. Sorry.

272
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:38,161
You want a glass case?

273
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:38,595
What?

274
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,464
I used to keep the book
in there.

275
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,065
Well, maybe you'll find
something

276
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:42,766
better to put in there.

277
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:47,604
Yeah. Another book
worth $650,000? [chuckles]

278
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:49,373
I really doubt that.

279
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,011
I'll walk you out. [grunts]

- What's it gonna be?
- Uh,

283
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,772
$26 seems like a lot.

284
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,541
You know I can get it
cheaper online, right?

285
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,475
Yeah, I do know that.

286
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,144
You should really
lower your prices,

287
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,379
if you want to be competitive.

288
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,315
Lower my prices.

289
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:35,485
I hadn't considered that before.

290
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,753
Are you being cheeky?

291
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:37,654
No, I'm thankful.

292
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,791
And at the next Island Books
shareholders' meeting,

293
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:45,362
I'll definitely raise
this innovative suggestion

294
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:46,063
of yours.

295
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,732
Between you and me, for a time
in the early aughties,

296
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,133
we'd given up on competition.

297
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,201
Which I thought was a mistake,

298
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,837
but my board decided
that competition was best left

299
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,740
to Olympic athletes,
kids in spelling bees,

300
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,408
and soft drink manufacturers.

301
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,545
These days, I'm glad to report
that Island Books is definitely

302
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,347
in the competition business
once again.

00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,397
Two.

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,207
Yes, elephant.

LAMBIASE: To the Owner
of the Bookstore, this is Maya.

321
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,853
She's very smart,
exceptionally verbal

322
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,522
for 25 months,
and a sweet, good girl.

323
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,624
I want her to grow up
in a place with books

324
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:58,562
and among people who care
about those kinds of things.

325
00:19:58,564 --> 00:19:59,829
I love her very much,

326
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,932
but I can no longer take care
of her.

327
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:02,966
Father cannot be in her life,

328
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,569
and I do not have a family
that can help.

329
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:09,472
I am desperate.
Yours, Maya's mother.

330
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,274
Mother left this for you.

331
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:12,809
Not for me specifically.

332
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,478
Like... like, generally.

333
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,913
For the owner of the store.

334
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,951
Which is... you.

335

Here's the thing.
It's 09:00 p.m. on a Friday.

336
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,855

I doubt they'll even make
it here by Monday.

341
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:37,400
Someone will have to watch Maya
over the weekend.

342
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,737
- Me and a couple of cops...
- No, it's fine. It's fine.

343
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,473
Just doesn't seem right
to keep a baby

345
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,843
What do you know
about child care?

346
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,713
Well, it's only for the weekend.

Do you have any idea
what on earth

350
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,468
I should feed

352
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,873
It's the best I could do
on short notice.

Oh, it's perfect.
My kitchen is a fiasco.

354
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,346

00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,529
Why didn't you leave her
at the police station?

360
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,033
That didn't seem right.

361
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,836
You're not thinking
of keeping it, are you?

362
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:49,574
Her, and no, of course not.

363
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,810
I'm only watching her
until Monday.

364
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:57,314
I suppose
the mom could show up by then

365
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,817
and change her mind.

366
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,351
[inhales, exhales]

367
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:02,519
Yeah.

368
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:08,758
[♪]

369
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,329
[sighs]

370
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,419
Cover her up.

371
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,490
Hey!

372
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:41,358
Moustache.

373
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,826
You think I should shave it?

374
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:43,426
No.

375
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,695
I might look more youthful
without it?

376
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,796
No.

377
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,133
Okay.

378
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:52,003
We found her mother.

379
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,007
Who was she?

380
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,108
Harvard kid.

381
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,709
So, smart?

382
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,778
Only a few of them are smart.

383
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,782
I went to Princeton myself.

384
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:08,885
Scholarship.
State Championship Swimmer.

385
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,989
Liked bookstores, liked to read.

386
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,857
Poor. No family.

387
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,592
Foster kid.

388
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:18,497
22, with a 25-month-old.

389
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:22,132
Strange to me is
why she was on Alice Island

390
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,466
in the first place?

391
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:26,705
It's kind of a hassle
to get here, you know?

392
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,005
You really believe
she wasn't coming here

393
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,974
to see someone specific?

394
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,676
I've been thinking
about that, too.

395
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:37,080
Ah, maybe she didn't have a
plan of where she was going?

396
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,884
Come on, Lambiase.

397
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:40,150
You're a cop.

398
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,718
You can't really believe that.

399
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,619
Oh, what's your theory?

400
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,587
AJ:
Well, I don't have a theory.

401
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,091
But I am a reader.

402
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:49,626
As a reader I believe
in narrative construction.

403
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,628
If a gun shows up in act one,

404
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,563
that gun better go off
in act three.

405
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:54,898
There aren't coincidences.

406
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,102
Well, that's in stories.

407
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,871
And in real life,
there's load of them.

408
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:01,037
Hm.

409
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,008
So, the lady from DCF
is coming for Maya on Monday.

410
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,076
And since the mother
didn't have any family

411
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:10,582
and the paternity is unknown,

412
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,750
they'll have to put her
in a foster home.

413
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,855
Oh, you said the mother
went through the foster system?

414
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:21,991
Suppose she thought her kid
stood a better chance

415
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,228
in a bookstore?

416
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,864
It's hard to say.

417
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,132
Well, it's moot, right?

418
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,636
Cause I can't adopt a child.

419
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:34,673
I can barely keep myself
together.

420
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,509
And I haven't slept
in two nights.

421
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:40,011
Hey, she looks nice
but she's a terrorist.

422
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:41,744
She's got bad taste in books.

423
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:44,714
Her conversation skills lack
to say the least.

424
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,618
And even if she were

425
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:48,251
Ira Glass,

426
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,889
it wouldn't matter
cause I'm poor.

427
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:55,093
Can't raise a baby
on books alone.

428
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,728
I don't want to surrender you
to the State of Massachusetts

429
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,900
looking like a miniature
Miss Havisham.

430
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:05,869
Sorry, she's a character
in Dickens.

431
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,103
Dickens.

432
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:09,107
AJ:
Very good.

433
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:12,809
Just so you know, Dickens
was terribly sentimental.

434
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:17,247
Hm, he got paid by the word,
and it shows.

435
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,683
Waw.

436
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:20,986
[grunts]

437
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:25,924
So, tell me, uh Jenny,

438
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:28,892
how does a foster family
get pre approved?

439
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:29,792
Is it as easy as, say,

440
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:32,695
getting a department store
credit card?

441
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,830
No, of course.

442
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,999
There are more steps
to it than that.

443
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,300
Applications, home visits...

444
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,903
What I'm trying to say,

445
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,939
Jenny, is how do you make sure

446
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,707
you aren't placing
an innocent child

447
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,577
in the hands
of a complete psychopath?

448
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:48,278
Mr. Fikry, we certainly

449
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,547
don't start from the point of
view that...

450
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,282
I worry because
Maya is very bright

451
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,753
but she's also very trusting.

452
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,185
All our foster homes
have gone through

453
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:59,155
- an application process...
- I went to a series of

454
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:00,623
competitive Ivy League colleges,

455
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,592
with rigorous application
processes,

456
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:05,728
and it's not as if applications
kept all the idiots out.

457
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,030
And the foster home
is only temporary and...

458
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:11,169
See, the thing is,
the mother left me this note.

459
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:17,609
She really wanted me
to have her, so...

460
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,711
I really think
I should keep her.

461
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:24,914
But Mr. Fikry the letter
doesn't say you specifically.

462
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:28,318
It says, generally,
"the owner of the bookstore".

463
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,689
Who is me.

464
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,289
AJ.

465
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,961
Yes, AJ.

466
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:50,008
Daddy, Daddy.

467
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,677
AJ.

468
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,280
AJ!

469
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:58,781
AJ! AJ! AJ!

470
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,186
Awake! Downstairs!

471
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:05,088
- Oh, yeah.
- [indistinct chattering]

472
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,322
All right, guys.

473
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:07,223
Settle down.

474
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:08,691
You got your drinks?

475
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:10,059
- DANIEL: Hm.
- Okay.

476
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:14,931
We're here to celebrate Maya,
who's officially become a Fikry.

477
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,265
[all cheer]

478
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,701
LAMBIASE:
It's been a long 14 months.

479
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,069
You know, AJ didn't want
to have a party.

480
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,238
I was like, dude,
it's not a big deal.

481
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,641
You go to Costco.
You get some big muffins.

482
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,877
[LAMBIASE: A few bottles
of champagne. No big deal.]

483
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,145
You know, also uh,

484
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,647
I'm the Godfather.
[all chuckle]

485
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,383
So, you know that wasn't going
to happen without a party.

486
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:34,684
[all chuckle]

487
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:37,086
I'd like to raise a glass
to Is may.

488
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,023
She's the Godmother.
Thank you.

489
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:40,957
CROWD MEMBER 1:
Is may.

490
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,426
LAMBIASE: Oh, and since you're
all here, I'm starting a book club.

491
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:44,861
- CROWD MEMBER 2: Ah?
- LAMBIASE: Yeah.

492
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,262
For law enforcement officers.

493
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:49,298
Or people who are just
law enforcement enthusiasts.

494
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:49,999
It's open.

495
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,102
We'll be reading "Out of Sight"
by Elmore Leonard.

496
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,904
So, get a book from the store.

497
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:58,408
AJ's a dad, we need to keep
Island Books in business.

498
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,442
[crowd cheering]

499
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,713
CROWD MEMBER 3:
For Maya!

500
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:06,282
One, two, three, four,

501
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:11,022
five, six, seven, eight, nine!

502
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:15,291
Good morning, cherry tree!

503
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,427
Good morning, magazines!

504
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,364
Good morning, books!

505
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:22,300
Good morning, bookstore!

506
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:34,010
- Hi, Amy.
- AMELIA: Hi.

507
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,745
You're early, Miss Loman.

508
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,046
I brought you
some picture books.

509
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,082
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

510
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,116
I haven't read all of these yet

511
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,318
so I really want to know
what you think, okay?

512
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,820
MAYA:
Okay.

513
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,723
So, ready to chat about
the spring list?

514
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,925
Oh God,
is it spring list time already?

515
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,760
It comes every year.

516
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,028
Yeah, come in.

517
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,865
[both chuckles]

518
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:57,736
Oh.

519
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,205
Read anything good lately?

520
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,807
AJ: Honestly, I haven't
had much time for reading

521
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:06,277
since I became a dad.

522
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,952
[Maya coughing]

523
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:23,928
[sighs]

524
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,074
How did you get up here?

525
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:44,147
LEON FRIEDMAN: The first
time I saw Halley's Comet in 1986,

526
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,284
I was already old.

527
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,223
Halley's Comet
will return in 2061,

528
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:57,160
and scientists predict
it will be a better,

529
00:29:57,162 --> 00:30:00,565
brighter appearance
than in 1986.

530
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:04,367
I will, needless to say,
be dead.

531
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:06,002
It isn't a sad thing.

532
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:08,938
Many of you will be dead, too.

533
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,572
Such is life.

534
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,841
Depending on when you were born,

535
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,544
you have a chance
of seeing Halley's Comet

536
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:15,945
twice in a lifetime.

537
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:19,081
But I was not born
at the right time for that.

538
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,450
Some of us live one-comet lives.

539
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:25,123
And this, I suppose,
must be enough.

540
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:35,198
[AJ crying]

541
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,467
[grunts]

542
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:43,074
Why are you crying?

543
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,911
I was reading.

544
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,547
[♪]

545
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,349
- Hello?
- Oh, hi.

546
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,485
Amelia, this is AJ Fikry
from Island.

547
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,988
I wasn't expecting you
to answer.

548
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,224
Are we still on for two weeks
from now,

549
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,992
or do you have to cancel?

550
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,228
Oh no, nothing like that.
I was um,

551
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,263
planning on leaving you a
message, actually.

552
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:11,367
AMELIA: Hi, you have reached
the voicemail of Amelia Loman.

553
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,135
Beep.

554
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:13,870
Um...

555
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,438
AMELIA:
Beep. Go ahead.

556
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,473
Leave your message.

557
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:20,376
Um okay, hi, Amelia.

558
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,644
This is AJ Fikry.

559
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:26,115
I just finished reading a book
that you recommended.

560
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:28,217
AMELIA:
Oh yeah, which one?

561
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,252
That's odd.

562
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:32,622
Voice mail seems to be
talking back to me.

563
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,891
It was from several years back.

564
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,293
"The Late Bloomer"
by Leon Friedman.

565
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,961
Oh, don't go breaking
my heart, AJ.

566
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:42,465
That was my absolute favorite
from four winter lists ago.

567
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,566
No one wanted to read it.

568
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,037
I don't know if you remember,
but

569
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,338
you gave me "The Late Bloomer"
the first time we met.

570
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,172
AMELIA:
Did I?

571
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:52,909
Would have been around
the time I started at Knightley.

572
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,543
Well, you know,
that literary memoirs

573
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:55,978
aren't really my thing,

574
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,648
but this was spectacular

575
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,350
in its small way.

576
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:02,285
Hm-mm. Go on.

577
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:07,556
Every word the right one
and exactly where it should be.

578
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:08,991
Oh, darn it.

579
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:10,626
What?
[Amelia sighs]

580
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:12,061
Missed my turn.

581
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,062
Oh well, that's all. I'll...

582
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:14,664
I'll let you get back
to the road.

583
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,532
I'm sorry it took me so long
to read it.

584
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:19,101
I begged everyone I knew
to read this book,

585
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,404
and no one would listen to me
except my mother.

586
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:24,008
Even she wasn't an easy sell.

587
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,542
Sometimes books don't find us
until the right time.

588
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:30,212
[chuckles] It's not much
consolation for Mr. Friedman.

589
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:32,250
AJ:
I suppose not.

590
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,954
Hmm, well, Amelia,

591
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,220
I guess I'll see you
in a couple of weeks.

592
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:40,489
AMELIA: Oh, maybe next
time you will listen to me

593
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,591
when I tell you something's the
'best book

594
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:43,492
on the winter list'.

595
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:47,163
AJ: Yeah, probably not. I'm
old, set in my ways, contrary.

596
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,631
You're not that old.

597
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,000
AJ: Not compared to
Mr. Friedman, I guess.

598
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:53,336
Hm, maybe when you're in town
next week,

599
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:57,241
- have dinner or something.
- Sir, I'd like to purchase this.

600
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:00,044
- Just one second.
- Hmph.

601
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:03,012
Sorry, customers.

602
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:03,646
Stores have those.

603
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:07,118
Yeah sometimes.
It's annoying really.

604
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:10,586
So uh, dinner?

605
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,021
Right.

606
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:15,758
We cam discuss
the new winter list.

607
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,525
Of course.

608
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,427
Yes, of course. It's such a long
trip from Alice.

609
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:22,266
You'll be hungry. It's rude that
I haven't suggested it before.

610
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,632
Let's make it a late lunch then.

611
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:27,470
I'll need to catch
the last ferry back to Hyannis.

612
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:31,107
[♪]

613
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:35,680
[indistinct chattering]

614
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:45,256
Pequods, like Moby Dick.

615
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:47,525
Do you like Moby Dick?

616
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,192
I hate it.

617
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,228
I don't say that
about many things.

618
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,764
Teachers assign it,
and there're parents are happy

619
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,732
because their kids are reading
something of quality.

620
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:58,467
But it's forcing kids
to read books like that

621
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:01,103
that makes them think
they hate reading.

622
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:02,138
I'm surprised you didn't cancel

623
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,672
when you saw the name
of the restaurant.

624
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,810
Oh, I thought about it.

625
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,544
Aarghh!

626
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,046
Ahoy, landlubbers.

627
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,381
Care for a themed cocktail?

628
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,117
One Queequeg, please.

629
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,652
Ah, okay.

630
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:17,253
Sir?

631
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:21,659
Just, a glass of whatever
your house red is.

632
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,095
Okay.

633
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,195
That's sad.

634
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,463
I bet you've gone
your whole life

635
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,799
without having a Queequeg
despite the fact

636
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,667
that you live here
and you sell books

637
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:35,073
and you probably even like
Moby Dick.

638
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,573
You're obviously a more
evolved person than I am.

639
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,308
Yeah, I can see that.
[chuckles]

640
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:43,345
And after I have this cocktail,
my whole life's going to change.

641
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,581
One Queequeg for the lady.

642
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,683
- Oh.
- One glass of red

643
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:49,620
for the gentleman.

644
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,525
Thanks.

645
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:59,295
Look, a little shrimp through
a plastic anchor.

646
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:03,167
That is an unexpected delight.

647
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,534
Cheers.

648
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,839
Mm. Cheers.

649
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,576
Ooh.

650
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:14,343
[AJ sighs]

651
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,114
AMELIA:
So...

652
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:19,450
let's talk books.

653
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:23,554
Books.

654
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,327
Well, thank you again for lunch.

655
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,798
Next time it's on me.

656
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,670
Why don't I walk you
to the ferry?

657
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:42,605
All right.

658
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,240
If you don't mind me asking,

659
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:45,441
why was "The Late Bloomer"

660
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:48,212
your favorite book
from the list?

661
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:51,716
- You're a young...
- No, no, no. Not that young.

662
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:56,485
What I mean to say is
you probably haven't experienced

663
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,457
much of what Mr. Friedman
describes.

664
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:02,825
I look at you,
and after reading the book,

665
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,693
I wonder what made you
respond to it.

666
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:09,398
Mr. Fikry, that is a very
personal question.

667
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,399
Sorry.

668
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:11,867
The main reason I loved the book

669
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:15,773
was the quality of the writing,
of course.

670
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:18,374
Of course.

671
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,344
But that isn't enough.

672
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:23,913
Let's just say I'd been
on many, many bad dates

673
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:27,283
by the time "The Late Bloomer"
came across my desk.

674
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,285
I am a romantic person,

675
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:34,458
but these don't always seem
like romantic times to me.

676
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,560
The "Late Bloomer" is a book
about the possibility

677
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:41,599
of finding great love
at any age.

678
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,503
Sounds cliché, I know.

679
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,373
And you?
Why did you like it?

680
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:50,873
Quality of the prose.

681
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,408
No, we're not allowed
to say that, I thought.

682
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,777
[chuckles] You don't want to
hear my sad stories.

683
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:58,583
Sure, I do.
I love sad stories.

684
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,992
My wife died
a couple of years ago,

685
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,994
and Friedman gets
at something specific

686
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,632
about what it is
to lose someone.

687
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,602
How it isn't one thing.

688
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:22,506
He writes about how you lose
and lose and lose.

689
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,578
It could have been
a popular book.

690
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,314
I know.

691
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:35,718
I'm thinking of having someone
read a passage

692
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,722
from it at my wedding.

693
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:41,490
- You're getting married, Amelia.
- [chuckles]

694
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:43,993
Congratulations!
Who's the lucky fellow?

695
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:46,595
- His name is Brett Brewer.
- Hmm.

696
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:50,833
I had just about given up
when I met him online.

697
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:51,600
Tell me more.

698
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:55,304
He's in the military,
serving overseas in Afghanistan.

699
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:58,841
Oh, well done. You're marrying
an American hero.

700
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:00,511
I guess I am.

701
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,711
- I hate those guys.
- [both chuckles]

702
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:04,013
Well, they just make me feel
so inadequate.

703
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:06,448
Tell me something shitty
about him so I feel better.

704
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,750
Well, he's not home much.

705
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,752
Yeah, you must miss him.

706
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,053
I do.

707
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,055
Get a ton of reading done,
though.

708
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,958
That's good. Does he read, too?

709
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,426
No, actually.

710
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:19,628
No, he's not much of a reader.

711
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,863
That's kind of interesting.

712
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:24,600
I just mean, it's interesting
to be with someone whose, um...

713
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,535
whose interests
are so different from mine.

714
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:29,938
I don't know
why I keep saying 'interests.'

715
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,674
The point is, he is a good man.

716
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,509
And he's good to you,
that's what counts.

717
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,012
Hm.

718
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,445
Anyway, no one's perfect.

719
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,781
Someone probably made him
read "Moby Dick" in high school.

720
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:41,717
[chuckles]

721
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:45,321
And your wife, was she a reader?

722
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,989
Mm-hm.

723
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,624
And a writer.

724
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:49,858
Hmm.

725
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,460
I wouldn't worry about it,
though.

726
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:52,761
Reading's overrated.

727
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:55,064
Look at all the good stuff
on television.

728
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,398
Hm.

729
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,004
Oh, darn it!
I think that's my ferry.

730
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:02,404
It was nice talking
with you, AJ.

731
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:03,972
I'll see you in March!

732
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:04,873
Looking forward to it.

733
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:09,712
Hey, don't wait four years
to read my books next time!

734
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:10,446
I won't!

735
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:13,349
AJ. There's something
kind of heroic

736
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,683
about being a bookseller.

737
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,452
There's also something
kind of heroic

738
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,120
about adopting a child!

739
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,855
Thank you, Amelia.

740
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,493
My friends call me Amy!

741
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:25,894
[sighs]

742
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:30,699
[♪]

743
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,101
AJ:
I think I've met someone.

744
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:32,868
Haha, good news.

745
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:36,105
Yeah. The problem is, she's
affianced to someone else.

746
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,639
- Ah, bad timing.
- Yeah.

747
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:40,676
You know, I've been a cop
for over 20 years.

748
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,578
Pretty much every bad thing
in life

749
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,979
is a result of bad timing.

750
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:47,485
And every good thing
is a result of good timing.

751
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:49,485
That seems terribly reductive.

752
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:52,020
Hey, it's good to know
your heart still works.

753
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,789
Want me to set you up
with someone?

754
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:54,456
Nah.

755
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:55,591
Come on, I know everyone
in town.

756
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:58,660
Yeah unfortunately,
it's a very small town.

757
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:06,662
[♪]

758
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:12,875
So Lambiase says
you own the bookstore?

759
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,445
Hm.

760
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:17,613
Oh, do you read?

761
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:18,747
A ton actually.

762
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,449
Oh, great.

763
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:22,586
Mainly sports memoirs.

764
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,887
Yeah, they're my thing.

765
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,924
You know they're all
ghostwritten?

766
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,191
Yeah, so what?

767
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:31,429
These books... they're...

768
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:34,832
Look, my point is
they're essentially lies.

769
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:37,433
All of life's
in a sports memoir.

770
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,734
You practice hard, you succeed,

771
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:42,473
and then eventually your body
gives out and it's over.

772
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,541
Sounds like a latter-period
Philip Roth novel.

773
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:46,108
[both chuckles]

774
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,678
That's one of those things
you say to sound smart, right?

775
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,081
But, really,

776
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:54,218
you're trying to make
someone else feel stupid.

777
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,156
[exhales]

778
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:04,626
I'm not sure
I wanna see you again.

779
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,729
[breathes heavily]

780
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:11,168
I'm sorry if I hurt your
feelings before.

781
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,071
The memoirs thing, I just...

782
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,507
Don't worry about it.

783
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:18,843
You can't help the way you are.

784
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:25,749
- [♪]
- [indistinct chatter]

785
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:28,050
AJ:
Maya, do you know how old I am?

786
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,251
MAYA:
No.

787
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,686
I'm 43.

788
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,122
Oh.

789
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,057
In all these years
I've learned that it's...

790
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,893
it's better to have loved
and lost

791
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:38,894
and it's better to be alone

792
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:42,197
than to be with someone
you don't really fancy.

793
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,868
Do you agree?

794
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:49,271
Sometimes, though,
I get tired of learning lessons.

795
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:54,076
[♪]

796
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,611
I have a question.

797
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:56,645
Yes, beautiful.

798
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,580
Don't you ever go to work?

799
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:00,082
Uh, I'm at work right now.

800
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:01,583
You don't look like
you're working.

801
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:03,552
You look like you're reading.

802
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:06,121
Don't you have a place
that you go

803
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:07,022
where you have a job?

804
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:10,125
Hm mm. Come here,
I wanna show you something.

805
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:11,560
All right, look at this.

806
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:14,763
You see, this right here...

807
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:16,100
Who's that?

808
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:18,634
Daniel Parish.

809
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:19,935
Hm mm.

810
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:21,737
- You're a writer.
- Oh.

811
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:22,771
What is this about?

812
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:24,706
Ah, it's about the follies
of man.

813
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,876
It's a... it's a love story
and a tragedy.

814
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,279
That's very general.

815
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:32,548
Right, okay. It's about um,

816
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,082
a nurse
who has spent her whole life

817
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:35,150
taking care of other people.

818
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:36,184
She gets in a car accident,

819
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:38,220
and now the other people
have to take care of her

820
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,988
for the first time in her life.

821
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:42,758
That does not sound like
something I would read.

822
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,027
Well, it was on the New York
Times Bestseller List

823
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,897
for over a year.

824
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:53,604
Is Daniel Parish a good writer?

825
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:57,308
He is good,
but he's not my favorite.

826
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,743
That's what I thought.

827
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,846
- Let me answer it.
- Yeah.

828
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:05,881
Island Books, Maya speaking.

829
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,282
AMELIA:
Hi, Maya.

830
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:07,916
Hi, Amy!

831
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,052
AMELIA: Did you read
the book I sent you?

832
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:11,053
Hey!

833
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:11,987
Amelia. Amelia, hello.

834
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:15,891
AMELIA: Hi, AJ. I'd like to have
our next meeting over video call.

835
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:17,259
- Is that okay?
- No, it's...

836
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,662
it's not a problem.
Maybe uh, next week?

837
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:23,899
AMELIA:
Great. I'll send over details.

838
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:25,200
What?

839
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:26,668
Summer list time.

840
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,770
Okay, so Knightley has not one

841
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:31,173
but two short-story collections
on the summer...

842
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:32,843
Crutches?

843
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:34,743
Yeah.

844
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:37,279
Yeah, that's we are meeting
this way.

845
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,281
Did this stupid thing
of breaking my ankle

846
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:43,118
and now I'm stuck here
for the next six or seven weeks.

847
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,086
I'm sorry.

848
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,721
That's my own fault.

849
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:49,360
Galoshes are better for rain
than ice.

850
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,761
So, back to the list.

851
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:54,630
When is the wedding?

852
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,934
Or has it already happened yet?

853
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:00,736
It's off actually.

854
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:02,170
Amelia, I'm sorry to hear that.

855
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:05,040
Hm, happened a while ago.
Over Christmas.

856
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:08,278
What happened?
If you don't mind me asking.

857
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:11,179
Brett's a great guy,
but the sad truth is

858
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:14,785
we don't have very much
in common.

859
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:18,822
Shared sensibility does matter.

860
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:22,758
AMELIA:
Okay, so a story I really love.

861
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,193
It has a murder mystery element
but...

862
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:26,028
What is that book?

863
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,829
- AMELIA: Which book?
- That... that book.

864
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:31,299
It's leaning on the lamp,
on the table behind you.

865
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:34,770
Hm, wouldn't you like to know.
It's my favorite.

866
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:38,206
It was a gift from my father
for my college graduation.

867
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:40,075
Huh. So, what is it?

868
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:44,046
If you ever come down
to Providence, I'll show you.

869
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:52,048
[♪]

870
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:58,927
This isn't like a date, is it?

871
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:00,230
Uh...

872
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:04,301
I'm teasing. Come inside.

873
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,843
[grunts]

874
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:19,748
No, please. Sit. Let me.

875
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,085
Mm-hmm.

876
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:26,421
You were so mean to me
the first time we met.

877
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:29,458
I still haven't forgiven you,
you know?

878
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,359
Yeah, I'd hoped
you'd forgotten that.

879
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:32,961
I haven't.

880
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:36,133
My memory is very long, AJ.

881
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:38,467
I was awful.

882
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:43,173
But in my defense,
I was going through a bad time.

883
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:48,779
Told my mother about you.

884
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,747
She said that
you didn't sound like

885
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,282
very good boyfriend material.

886
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:56,952
I know. I'm not.
Sorry about that.

887
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:59,490
Because I like you enormously.

888
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:07,896
[AJ grunts]

889
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:10,098
Do you wanna see
what that book is?

890
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,233
Which book?

891
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:13,935
The book in my office
that you asked me about.

892
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:17,307
Isn't that what you came to see?

893
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:24,148
My office is through my
bedroom, by the way.

894
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,787
Hm.

895
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:44,501
I'll show you the book
in the morning.

896
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:51,239
My ankle hurts, so

897
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:53,175
apologies if my seduction

898
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:56,578
lacks some of the subtlety
it might usually have.

899
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:04,580

[♪]

904
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:25,033
AMELIA: Dear AJ,
my mother likes to say

905
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:28,538
that novels have ruined me
for real men.

906
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,473
I find this insulting
because it implies

907
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:32,474
that I only read books

908
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:35,545
with classically
romantic heroes.

909
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:37,579
I don't mind
the occasional novel

910
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,348
with a romantic hero
but as you know by know,

911
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,652
my tastes are far more varied
than that.

912
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:45,153
One way or round trip?

913
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:45,921
Uh, round.

914
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:49,157
AMELIA: For instance, I adore
Humbert Humbert as a character

915
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,625
while accepting the fact

916
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:52,661
that he would make
an appalling boyfriend

917
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:55,130
or even casual acquaintance.

918
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:57,198
The same is true
for Holden Caulfield

919
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,567
and Misters Rochester and Darcy.

920
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:03,004
But I think where my mother
has a point is,

921
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:04,706
in so far as I tend to take in

922
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:08,209
an overly romantic view
of things.

923
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:10,245
And, this means
I have been known

924
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:14,249
to ignore the signs
that something won't work out.

925
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:16,518
So, while these last months
have been

926
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,289
some of the most romantic...

927
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,290
Ah, you'd been gone too long.

928
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,024
Only a week.

929
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:25,961
AMELIA: So, while I feel
a real connection with...

930
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:29,130
[indistinct chatter]

931
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,634
AMELIA: So, while I certainly
enjoyed our time together

932
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,739
and I loved to getting
to know Maya,

933
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,740
the reality is it takes me
five hours

934
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:41,643
to get to Alice Island,
if the traffic is good,

935
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:42,510
which it rarely is.

936
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:46,550
And, if the ferry is running
which it often is not,

937
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,216
I can't move from Providence,

938
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:51,319
and you can't move
from Alice Island.

939
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:54,257
The situation is irresolvable.

940
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:59,294
And maybe it isn't fair to Maya,

941
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:02,430
or to you, or to me
to continue on, on something

942
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,733
that is doomed to fail.

943
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:08,303
As my mother like to say,
"Amelia, you're 34 years old.

944
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:10,338
You don't have any more time
to waste in

945
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,240
impossible relationships."

946
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:15,779
She doesn't mean herself,
by the way. Ha-ha.

947
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:20,482
I find it difficult to say,

948
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:23,520
any of these things
when we're together.

949
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:34,297
When are you coming back?

950
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:38,533
About that, I probably
won't be able to see you

951
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,602
as much as this summer.

952
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:41,503
I'm traveling for work,

953
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:44,205
my mother is going
to Providence in August.

954
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:47,509
Uh, and I...
I could come and see you?

955
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:50,380
I really won't be around much.

956
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,483
Amelia, I'm sorry.

957
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:55,316
For what?

958
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:57,788
That I can't do more
of the driving.

959
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:00,624
I love you.

960
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:03,760
I love you, too.

961
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:18,273
[♪]

962
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:21,176
MAYA: She's gonna love
it, and I hope she says yes.

963
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:24,446
Well, she'd still be our friend
even if she says no.

964
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:25,480
Why would she say no?

965
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:28,718
Lots of reasons.
Your dad isn't exactly a catch.

966
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,488
Hey.

967
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:33,557
[clears throat]

968
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:36,293
This okay with you, by the way?

969
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:39,561
[Maya chuckles]

970
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:41,865
Okay. Come on.

971
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,837
I'm pumped.
I've never met a writer before.

972
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:49,771
[sighs]

973
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,306
Daniel Parish.

974
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:53,441
Oh, yeah. Daniel Parish.

975
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,812
I always forget he's a writer.

976
00:51:56,313 --> 00:52:00,648
Leon Friedman.
Novelist extraordinaire.

977
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,183
Pleased to meet you.

978
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:04,219
- Oh.
- You must be AJ Fikry.

979
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:07,188
Ah, actually this is AJ Fikry.

980
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,590
You must be AJ Fikry!

981
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:09,491
[AJ chuckles]

982
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:11,392
The gal at Knightley says
you love my book.

983
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:14,829
[AJ sighs] - There's going
to be liquor at this event, yes?

984
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:18,668
Well, it is the afternoon
so we weren't planning on it,

985
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:22,806
but I am sure
I can procure some.

986
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:25,242
[grunts]

987
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:28,478
I thought he'd be different
somehow.

988
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:32,682
Authors never look like
their author photographs.

989
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,854

[sniffles]

991
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:45,226
I'm 81 years old,
and statistically speaking,

992
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:48,796
I should have died
4.7 years ago.

993
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:51,299
[all chuckle softly]

994
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:53,535
My God, this is depressing.

995
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:55,703
[crowd chuckle]

996
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:58,508
You people really like this?

997
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,811
Hmm.

998
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:18,595
- [burps]
- Oh.

999
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,264
OLD CUSTOMER:
Thanks.

1000
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:27,237
Mmm. Aaah.

1001
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:28,970
What's your favorite book?

1002
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,406
Oh, don't know that I have one.

1003
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:32,340
Why don't you tell me

1004
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:34,876
what you'd like
for Christmas instead?

1005
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,946
Christmas? Christmas isn't for
four months.

1006
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,747
[Leon Friedman chuckles]

1007
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:41,918
Well...

1008
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:44,519
Wow, it's really great
to meet you.

1009
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:45,653
My boyfriend
and I would probably

1010
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:49,891
would not have gotten together
if it weren't for your book.

1011
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,360
Ah, give me a hug.

1012
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:55,897
[groans]

1013
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,801
AMELIA:
Oh.

1014
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:02,270
That's the power of fiction
for you.

1015
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:02,904
Yeah, I suppose.

1016
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:07,442
Only it isn't fiction, right?
It actually happened.

1017
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:09,377
Oh yes, sweetheart.
Of course.

1018
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:11,446
Perhaps, Mr. Friedman meant
to say that

1019
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:13,648
that is the power of narrative.

1020
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,817
MARGARET: And perhaps
Mr. Friedman was trying to say

1021
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:18,653
that a relationship based
on loving a book is

1022
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:21,658
not likely to be much
of a relationship.

1023
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:23,625
- Margaret Loman.
- Ah.

1024
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:26,427
My spouse died a couple
of years ago, too.

1025
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:29,030
Amelia, my daughter,
made me read your book

1026
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:31,532
for my Widows
of Charleston Book Club.

1027
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:32,734
Everyone loved it.

1028
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:35,003
Oh, how nice.

1029
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:37,372
How nice.

1030
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:38,840
How...

1031
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:40,310
Yes?

1032
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,679
[vomits]

1033
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:45,949
Oh God!

1034
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,417
- Oh!
- I seem to have had

1035
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,019
too much to drink.

1036
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:52,722
Obviously.

1037
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,593
I'm going to take Friedman
to the airport.

1038
00:54:58,595 --> 00:54:59,494
Is may said she'd do it,

1039
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:00,662
but I think
the only decent thing

1040
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:03,431
- is for me to go with her.
- Hm, good man.

1041
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:06,336
I'll watch Maya
and I'll clean up here.

1042
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,706
I thought today
would be more romantic

1043
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:12,807
than it turned out to be.

1044
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,942
No, it's very romantic.

1045
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:17,812
It's more romantic
than a lecherous old drunk

1046
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,414
looking down my blouse?
[AJ chuckles]

1047
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:20,948
ISMAY:
AJ, we need to go.

1048
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,383
That's me.

1049
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:24,719
Hey uh, I don't think
I made a good impression

1050
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:26,087
on your mother.

1051
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:27,355
No one does.

1052
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:29,793
I wouldn't worry too much
about it.

1053
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:33,061
I love you.

1054
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:34,829
ISMAY:
AJ?

1055
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,866
[clears throat]

1056
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,806
I can help.

1057
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:45,506
Thank you.

1058
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:48,778
You can get all the plastic cups
and napkins.

1059
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:56,486
Was something wrong
with the writer?

1060
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,122
The usual.

1061
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:01,723
Oh, excuse me.

1062
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:06,427
I can't say he was completely
what I was expecting.

1063
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:08,096
What were you expecting?

1064
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:10,565
Someone more intellectual,
I think.

1065
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:12,367
- Hmm.
- That sounds really snobby.

1066
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,435
That's probably not
the right word.

1067
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:15,636
No, no. I...

1068
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:16,904
Um, I know what you mean.

1069
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:19,674
My expectations
were probably too high.

1070
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:22,545
I work for his publisher.

1071
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:26,681
It was my favorite thing
I ever sold, actually.

1072
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:28,651
Why was it your favorite?

1073
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:31,786
AMELIA:
I had lost my dad right before,

1074
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:33,588
and I guess something
in the voice

1075
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:34,889
reminded me of him.

1076
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:38,826
Also, there so many true,
true things in it.

1077
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:42,864
They make the publishers
clean up after the reading?

1078
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:43,798
[chuckles]

1079
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:48,102
No, I'm the bookstore owner's
girlfriend, too.

1080
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:50,004
So, I'm just helping out.

1081
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:51,439
Oh, he must be a huge fan
of the book

1082
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:53,808
to bring Leon Friedman here
after all these years.

1083
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:55,545
AMELIA:
Yeah.

1084
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:59,013
The truth is, he did it for me.

1085
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:02,552
It was the first book
we loved together.

1086
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:03,851
That's cute.

1087
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:05,420
Kind of like
the first restaurant you go to

1088
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:08,122
or the first song you danced to
or something.

1089
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:11,027
AMELIA:
Yeah, exactly.

1090
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:15,532
Why don't you think
the book sold?

1091
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:18,201
- "The Late Bloomer?"
- Hm.

1092
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:21,137
It's competitive out there.

1093
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:23,471
Sometimes even
when a book is good,

1094
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:26,576
it just still doesn't work.

1095
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,913
That must be hard.

1096
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:33,183
Are you writing a book
or something?

1097
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:36,186
I've tried, yes.

1098
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:41,991
Amelia Loman.

1099
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,659
Leon or a Ferris.

1100
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:45,526
Are you from Alice?

1101
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:48,596
No, I just came in for the day.
For the reading.

1102
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:51,866
Oh. You must be a big fan
of the book, too.

1103
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:53,100
I know from experience
that Alice

1104
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:55,803
is not the easiest place
in the world to get to.

1105
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:56,938
[chuckles]

1106
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,641
No, it isn't.

1107
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:02,577
No one travels without purpose.

1108
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:05,849
Those who are lost wish
to be lost.

1109
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:08,918
You're quoting
"The Late Bloomer."

1110
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:10,852
It really was your favorite.

1111
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:12,689
It was.

1112
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:16,691
"When I was young,
I never felt young."

1113
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:17,625
Something like that.

1114
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:20,230
Do you remember the rest
of that quote?

1115
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:22,230
- No.
- Oh,

1116
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:25,500
writers don't remember
everything they write.

1117
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,170
How could they?

1118
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,137
It was nice talking to you.

1119
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:35,178
You're him, aren't you?
You are Leon Friedman.

1120
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:38,045
[sighs]

1121
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:39,849
Not truly.

1122
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,785
What does that mean?

1123
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:45,086
A long time ago,
a girl wrote a novel,

1124
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:49,524
and she tried to sell it,
but no one wanted it.

1125
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,192
So, she thought it would
be easier

1126
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:54,564
if she retitled the book
and called it a memoir.

1127
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:56,631
Who was that man?

1128
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:59,033
I um, called a casting office.

1129
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,769
He usually plays Santa.

1130
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:02,270
[chuckles]

1131
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:04,639
I don't understand.
Why do the reading?

1132
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:06,741
Why go to the bother
and the expense?

1133
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:07,875
Why risk it?

1134
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,611
No, the book
had already flopped.

1135
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:13,216
And sometimes you wanna know...

1136
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,250
to see for yourself
that your work

1137
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:20,156
has meant something to someone.

1138
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:25,028
I feel a little fooled.

1139
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:32,867
You're a good writer, you know?

1140
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:36,039
[inhales, exhales]

1141
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,975
I do now.

1142
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:19,113
[scoffs]

1143
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,848
How was the drive?

1144
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:21,849
The best thing I can say is

1145
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:25,321
Mr. Friedman was passed out
for most of it.

1146
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:29,156
[deep sigh]

1147
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:30,992
I should get back to the hotel.

1148
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:33,094
My mother and I have to leave
early tomorrow.

1149
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:36,797
No. No, stay! Stay a bit.
Just think quick!

1150
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:37,732
- Oh!
- Oh!

1151
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:39,100
Ow! AJ what the fuck?

1152
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:41,268
I'm sorry I was trying
to get you not to leave.

1153
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:42,403
I thought
you were gonna catch it.

1154
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:44,805
Oh... you aimed a little high.

1155
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:48,711
It's uh... it's...
it's for you.

1156
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:57,020
Lets get married.

1157
01:00:58,421 --> 01:01:01,122
I know I'm stuck on this island.

1158
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:03,758
I know I'm poor,
a single father.

1159
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,394
And in a business with somewhat
diminishing returns.

1160
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:07,862
I know
that your mother hates me,

1161
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:10,131
that I'm obviously crap
at hosting author events-

1162
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:11,932
Wait.
This is a strange proposal.

1163
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:15,104
Lead with your strong stuff, AJ.

1164
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:21,177
All I know is
when I read a book,

1165
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:24,213
I want you to be reading it
at the same time.

1166
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:27,081
I want to know
what Amelia would...

1167
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:28,918
would think of it.

1168
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:35,224
Okay.

1169
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:37,894
Okay?

1170
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:40,061
Okay. [chuckles]

1171
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:42,930
Okay. Okay.

1172
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:44,098
[Amelia chuckles]

1173
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,067
[♪]

1174
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:49,704
At the end of the day,
a man feels compelled to share

1175
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,006
what he learned in this life.

1176
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:55,042
It is the secret fear
that we are unlovable

1177
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,310
that isolates us,

1178
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:59,080
but it is only
because we are isolated

1179
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:01,718
that we think
that we are un lovable.

1180
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:05,021
So, here's my wish for you.

1181
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:07,855
Some day, you do not know when,

1182
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:10,191
you will be driving
down the road.

1183
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:13,227
And some day,
you do not know when,

1184
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,929
you will make a wrong turn.

1185
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:19,233
At the end of the road,
when you're least expecting it,

1186
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:21,235
a person will be there.

1187
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:25,274
And this person
will be a city to you.

1188
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:29,310
And in this city,
there will be love.

1189
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:32,346
And in this city,
there will be sorrow.

1190
01:02:32,348 --> 01:02:35,483
And in this city,
there will be sickness,

1191
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:38,419
and health,
and better, and worse.

1192
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:41,255
And everything under the sun.

1193
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:49,257
[♪]

1194
01:02:58,207 --> 01:02:59,876
Is may!

1195
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:02,845
It's a little cold for a swim.

1196
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,352
Yeah, a little. I just...

1197
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:13,356
came up to clear my head.

1198
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:22,163
Must be hard to see
AJ married to someone

1199
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:23,864
other than your sister.

1200
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:28,971
Yeah, but Amelia seems lovely.

1201
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:35,478
The thing about weddings is

1202
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:39,849
it can make a person
feel real lonely.

1203
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:44,585
- Here.
- [breathes heavily]

1204
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:52,587
[♪]

1205
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:59,168
You took that turn
a little fast.

1206
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:01,468
I don't love you anymore.

1207
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:04,006
You always get like this
at weddings.

1208
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,607
You're not a good man.

1209
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:07,341
I'm complex.

1210
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:10,980
Maybe I'm not good, but I'm
certainly not the worst.

1211
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:19,455
Know you're bad.

1212
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:22,990
And what's worse,
is you've made me bad.

1213
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:25,059
Is may, this is an insane place
to park.

1214
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:28,896
Every time I see her
with AJ and Amelia,

1215
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:30,297
I'm sick to my stomach.

1216
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:32,967
Because she should
have been ours.

1217
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:33,467
What?

1218
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:35,905
If you had done the right thing,

1219
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:38,572
she'd be ours.

1220
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:40,443
[Daniel sighs]

1221
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:44,011
I know Marian Wallace
was your girlfriend.

1222
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:44,578
That isn't true.

1223
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:47,214
And I know that she left Maya
for you!

1224
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:50,987
If you thought that was true,
why didn't you do something?

1225
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,890
I was pregnant.

1226
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:58,125
I lost the baby
but I was pregnant.

1227
01:04:58,127 --> 01:04:59,927
And if you had just come to me,

1228
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:01,362
I would have adopted her,
Daniel.

1229
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:04,098
I would have forgiven you
and I would have taken her in.

1230
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,466
And she would have been ours.

1231
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:08,102
But Marian Wallace
was not my girlfriend.

1232
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:10,037
How stupid do you think
that I am?

1233
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:11,572
She was a girl
who came to a reading

1234
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:15,442
and a girl I slept with once.

1235
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:18,948
I mean, how could I even be sure
the child was mine? Hmm?

1236
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:22,685
Every last bit of love
I had for you is gone.

1237
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:25,552
I still love you.

1238
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:27,655
[grunts]

1239
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:29,256
I think I'm okay.

1240
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:30,927
Are you okay?

1241
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:34,295
Oh, my leg!
I think it's broken.

1242
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:36,130
Oh, it's bad...

1243
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:37,298
[Is may groans]

1244
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,535
Is may, you have to drive!

1245
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:42,670
DANIEL: "In The
Children in the Apple Tree,"

1246
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:46,106
the main character
is in a fatal car accident.

1247
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:47,341
I'd struggled writing it.

1248
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:49,576
Everything I knew
about fatal car accidents

1249
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:50,678
came from books I'd read.

1250
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:54,016
And I was never really happy
with what I'd written.

1251
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:57,620
The passage hadn't been
as bad as I thought.

1252
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:03,490
ISMAY:
Oh, Daniel.

1253
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:11,492
[♪]

1254
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:47,103
I thought you were gonna wear
the dress.

1255
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:51,774
Sorry, Amy.
Seemed too fancy.

1256
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:55,342
[audience applauding]

1257
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:59,279
Welcome, my friends and fellow
literature enthusiasts,

1258
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:01,482
to the 55th Annual Island County

1259
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:03,384
High School Short Story Contest.

1260
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:04,351
[audience applauds]

1261
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:06,653
MR. BALBONI: You all
are in for a treat tonight!

1262
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:09,423
I'd like to congratulate
our ten semi-finalists,

1263
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:13,227
who represent the best young
minds of Island County.

1264
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:16,463
Now, onto our three finalists.

1265
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:19,435
From Alice Island High School,

1266
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:21,769
"My Grandmother's Hands"
written by John Furness.

1267
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:26,442
[audience applauds]

1268
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:31,380
"My Grandmother's Hands."

1269
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:35,718
When I was young, I didn't
realize that people got old.

1270
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:37,618
I thought some people
were just born old, and

1271
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,353
some people
were just born young...

1272
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:41,455
[audience chuckle]

1273
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:43,257
"The Journey" by Virginia Kim.

1274
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:47,396
[audience applauds]

1275
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,665
"The Journey."

1276
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:53,133
The girl did not know
that it would be the last time

1277
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:57,406
she would see her mother
until she was on the plane.

1278
01:07:57,673 --> 01:08:01,177
She had never been
on a plane before.

1279
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:03,377
[audience applauds]

1280
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,478
Our last finalist

1281
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,848
is also from Alice Island High
School.

1282
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:09,716
[takes a deep breath]

1283
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:12,419
"A Day at the Beach"
by Maya T. Fikry.

1284
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,321
[audience applauds]

1285
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:18,094
Yeah! That's my goddaughter.

1286
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:20,828
It's actually
"A Trip to the Beach."

1287
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:22,196
MR. BALBONI:
Sorry, what did I say?

1288
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:24,198
You said, "A Day at the Beach,"
which is close,

1289
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,433
but it means something
completely different.

1290
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,537
I stand corrected.

1291
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:33,275
"A Trip to the Beach."

1292
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:35,676
Mary is running late.

1293
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:38,612
She has a private room,
but she shares the bathroom

1294
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:40,247
with six other people.

1295
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:43,383
[♪]

1296
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:46,722
MAYA: It seems like
someone's always using it.

1297
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:50,124
She owed her money.

1298
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:52,862
It terrified her
to think how much.

1299
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:56,663
She felt as if she had
been running

1300
01:08:56,665 --> 01:08:59,368
for the better part
of two years.

1301
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:03,439
Every part of her body
was tired.

1302
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:07,541
And yes, Mary knew
she was a disappointment.

1303
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:10,277
She could see it in
the professor's kind,

1304
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:12,181
disinterested...

1305
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:15,516
What would be left?
Nothing.

1306
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:19,588
The end of some credit cards
could cover the groceries...

1307
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:23,290
To have lowered herself
to return to this place,

1308
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:24,391
to this woman...

1309
01:09:24,393 --> 01:09:26,593
she had barely escaped
the first time.

1310
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:30,733
This dingy gray house
felt like a trap.

1311
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:37,371
The baby, she thought,
had so few things

1312
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:38,739
and so many things.

1313
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:42,478
And every year,
she would need so many more.

1314
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:46,382
She wasn't sure if the credit
card would go through,

1315
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:49,283
but then it did.

1316
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:50,350
It was just before Christmas,

1317
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:52,419
and the train station
was filled with families

1318
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:55,255
- and presents and good cheer...
- Wake up. She's almost finished.

1319
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:56,623
MAYA:
...and Mary had never felt...

1320
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:58,625
I haven't been asleep.

1321
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:02,229
Just imagining.
It's very vivid.

1322
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:04,331
MAYA:
Mary smiles brightly.

1323
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:07,736
"I thought I would take a trip
to the beach," she says.

1324
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:10,506
"The baby loves the beach."

1325
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:14,343
"Isn't it a little cold
for the beach?" the girl asked.

1326
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:15,909
When she gets to Alice Island,

1327
01:10:15,911 --> 01:10:19,680
the first place Mary sees
is a bookstore.

1328
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:22,249
She goes inside
so that she and the baby

1329
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:23,719
can warm up.

1330
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:26,855
A man is at the counter.

1331
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:29,289
That's you!

1332
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:31,592
He has a very grumpy demeanour.

1333
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:34,595
I'm looking for something
to read.

1334
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:35,963
What kind of books do you like?

1335
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:37,397
Oh, all kinds.

1336
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:39,466
I basically like them better
than people.

1337
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:41,468
[both chuckles]

1338
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:42,836
Me too.

1339
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:43,737
My favorite kind of book

1340
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:46,573
is where a character
has hardships

1341
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:48,911
but overcomes them in the end.

1342
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:51,378
It's silly probably.

1343
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:52,846
I know life isn't like that.

1344
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:55,484
Maybe that's why
it's your favorite?

1345
01:10:56,852 --> 01:10:58,420
Maybe.

1346
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:02,825
AJ: Oh, I have the perfect...
It just came in. One sec.

1347
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,569
Miss?

1348
01:11:16,305 --> 01:11:17,638
MAYA: He leaves the
book on the counter

1349
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:21,477
just in case Mary ever decided
to come back.

1350
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:27,781
MAYA: Mary is on the beach,
but the baby is not with her.

1351
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:30,386
She used to swim on a swim team.

1352
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:32,786
She was good enough to win the
state's championship

1353
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:34,721
in high school.

1354
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:37,658
That day, the water is cold,

1355
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:40,329
and Mary is out of practice.

1356
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:44,064
She swims out
past the lighthouse,

1357
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:47,036
and she doesn't swim back.

1358
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:57,544
[audience applauds]

1359
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:59,782
LAMBIASE:
Great job, Maya!

1360
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:08,422
[♪]

1361
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:11,927
I am going to frame
that certificate.

1362
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:15,998
Whatever. It's just third.

1363
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:19,635
And your story was amazing.

1364
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:21,904
Seriously.

1365
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:25,040
Thanks, Amy.

1366
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:28,043
Wasn't it, AJ?

1367
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:31,747
[AJ grunts]

1368
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:45,861
[grunts]

1369
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:55,569
- Just wait.
- Dad, I'm really...

1370
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:56,837
These things are never fair.

1371
01:12:56,839 --> 01:13:00,874
People like what they like,
and that's the great

1372
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:02,743
and terrible thing.

1373
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:04,010
It's about personal taste

1374
01:13:04,012 --> 01:13:06,980
and a certain set of people
on a certain day.

1375
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:10,584
For instance, two out of the
three finalists were women,

1376
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:13,754
which may have tipped
the scales toward the male.

1377
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:16,456
Maybe one
of the judges' grandmothers

1378
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:17,491
died last week,

1379
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:20,460
which made that story
particularly effective.

1380
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:21,895
One never knows.

1381
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:24,133
But here's what I do know.

1382
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:30,439
"A Trip to the Beach"
by Maya Tamerlane Fikry,

1383
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:34,843
that was written by a writer.

1384
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:45,587
I know it's dumb,

1385
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:48,524
just really wanted to win.

1386
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:52,027
I know.

1387
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:08,108
Yeah, okay, but what the heck
happened to the violin?

1388
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:11,180
I mean,
did I miss something here?

1389
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:14,481
A priceless Stradivarius
doesn't just disappear

1390
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:15,849
out of thin air.

1391
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:17,117
Maybe that's the writer's point

1392
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,219
that the violin's not the point?

1393
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:20,487
[chuckles]

1394
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:21,955
Of course, it's the point.

1395
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:23,990
Maybe the point is
how the violin

1396
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:25,759
affects everybody's lives?

1397
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:27,561
Oh, boo.

1398
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:29,663
Boooo. [chuckles]

1399
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:30,997
Back me up here, AJ.

1400
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:33,166
You don't always have to know
who stole the violin.

1401
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:35,902
Man, in my experience,
a book is more satisfying

1402
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:36,803
to readers if you do.

1403
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:37,971
- MAN IN BOOK STORE: Oh!
- Thank you!

1404
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:41,107
Though although I don't mind
ambiguity myself.

1405
01:14:41,109 --> 01:14:42,611
Traitor!

1406
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:46,748
ROSIE: Lambiase, do
you even read the book?

1407
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:48,849
LAMBIASE:
Yeah, I've read this book twice.

1408
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:50,750
Once, I put it on the chief's...

1409
01:14:50,752 --> 01:14:51,685
- Hi!
- Hey.

1410
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:54,554
ISMAY: I'm gonna need
50 copies of "Our Town."

1411
01:14:54,556 --> 01:14:55,655
It's a classic.

1412
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:57,958
- I did like it. Judgment free.
- [Rosie chuckles]

1413
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,594
If you look at her picture,
she's clearly saying,

1414
01:15:00,596 --> 01:15:02,996
"You're never gonna find out
where the damn violin was."

1415
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:04,865
She does have quite a smirk
on her, though.

1416
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:05,966
She does, she does.

1417
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:06,933
[Rosie chuckles]

1418
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:08,602
What group is this again?

1419
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:10,506
Chief's Choice.

1420
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:16,109
[♪]

1421
01:15:16,111 --> 01:15:19,613
So, what are you doing
when you're not being a cop?

1422
01:15:19,615 --> 01:15:21,982
Well, believe it or not,
I read a lot.

1423
01:15:21,984 --> 01:15:26,086
I mean, maybe you
wouldn't think it was that much.

1424
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:27,888
I know you teach English.

1425
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:29,022
What do you read?

1426
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:30,290
A little bit of everything.

1427
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:33,161
I started out with crime novels.

1428
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:36,596
Pretty predictable, that.

1429
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:38,532
I mean I'm a cop.

1430
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:41,001
Did you ever read
any of Daniel's books?

1431
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:43,103
One. The first one.

1432
01:15:43,105 --> 01:15:44,104
Did you like it?

1433
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:46,006
Not my cup of tea.

1434
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:48,710
It was very well written though.

1435
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:52,112
Do you miss your husband?

1436
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:55,684
The best parts of him
were in his books.

1437
01:15:57,252 --> 01:15:58,952
What do you like to read?

1438
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:01,755
Plays, the odd bit of poetry.

1439
01:16:01,757 --> 01:16:04,057
There's the books
that I teach every year.

1440
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:05,825
They're like old friends to me.

1441
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:08,228
But, if I'm choosing something
just for me,

1442
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,865
something new...

1443
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:13,967
...I'd say my favorite
kind of character

1444
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:17,070
is a woman in a faraway place.

1445
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:19,839
Like India, or Bangkok.

1446
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:21,608
She's just left her husband,

1447
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:23,076
or maybe she never had a husband

1448
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:24,711
because she knew, wisely,

1449
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:26,913
that the married life
was not for her.

1450
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:29,718
I like when she has
multiple lovers.

1451
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:32,218
And I like when she wears hats

1452
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:34,988
to shield her fair skin from the
sun.

1453
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:38,126
I like descriptions of hotels
and

1454
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,760
suitcases with stickers on them.

1455
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:44,798
And a little romance,
but not too much.

1456
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,299
The story is period.

1457
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:48,635
Maybe a war,
but in the background.

1458
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:49,903
Not a lot of bloodshed.

1459
01:16:49,905 --> 01:16:53,175
A little sex,
but not too graphic.

1460
01:16:54,076 --> 01:16:55,175
And no children.

1461
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:58,845
Cause they usually spoil
the story for me.

1462
01:16:58,847 --> 01:16:59,679
I don't have any.

1463
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:01,081
[chuckles] For I don't mind them
in real life.

1464
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:03,352
I just don't want
to read about them.

1465
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:06,186
An ending could be happy or sad.

1466
01:17:06,188 --> 01:17:10,292
I don't really care anymore
as long as it's earned.

1467
01:17:10,892 --> 01:17:13,226
And then she can settle down and

1468
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:15,964
open her own little business,

1469
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:20,068
or she can drown herself
in the ocean.

1470
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:35,115
Hey.

1471
01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:37,052
[soft chuckle]

1472
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,856
I'm gonna make you breakfast.

1473
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:50,391
[♪]

1474
01:17:50,732 --> 01:17:52,801
[kisses]

1475
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:57,303
Have you ever considered
not having a moustache?

1476
01:17:57,305 --> 01:18:00,275
If it bothers you, it's gone.

1477
01:18:01,943 --> 01:18:04,913
No, I like it.

1478
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:07,416
[chuckles]

1479
01:18:10,886 --> 01:18:14,189
LAMBIASE: I've been a
cop for almost 30 years.

1480
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:19,893
Sometimes it's hard
to stop being a cop.

1481
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:23,296
I had overly focused
on the details of things.

1482
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:26,232
Writers and cops are the same
that way.

1483
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:27,867
Good book, bad book.

1484
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:30,839
It's the details
that tell the story.

1485
01:18:31,306 --> 01:18:33,239
I'm not bragging but I can
always solve a

1486
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:35,775
solve a story before it's done.

1487
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:38,947
I might be a better reader
than a cop.

1488
01:18:40,015 --> 01:18:41,047
Answer the mysteries.

1489
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:44,219
Usually, the thing
that's out of place.

1490
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:50,490
But sometimes it's the things
in plain sight

1491
01:18:50,492 --> 01:18:53,159
that you don't allow yourself
to see.

1492
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:56,329
ISMAY: It's nice to have
someone to cook for.

1493
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:58,333
Smells great.

1494
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:01,367
LAMBIASE: The difference
between a cop and a writer

1495
01:19:01,369 --> 01:19:04,306
is that cops
have to see everything.

1496
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:08,310
Writers get to choose
what to see

1497
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:11,146
and what to ignore.

1498
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:20,414
[♪]

1499
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:34,503

01:20:10,839 --> 01:20:13,940
AMELIA: Hey, can you stop
at the store on your way home?

1503
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:15,942
We need Drain-o...

1504
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:17,076
- Drain-o.
- AMELIA: Sponges...

1505
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:19,045
- Sponges.
- AMELIA: Grapes, if they have them.

1506
01:20:19,047 --> 01:20:19,846
Grapes.

1507
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:21,381
Yeah, I'll get them
if they have them.

1508
01:20:21,383 --> 01:20:23,016
- AMELIA: Okay.
- I love you.

1509
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:24,586
AMELIA:
I love you, too.

1510
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,322
Oh...

[♪]

1512
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:48,109
Would you mind spelling
that for me?

1513
01:20:49,477 --> 01:20:52,013
I like to Google things.

1514
01:21:07,996 --> 01:21:11,030
[♪]

1515
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:12,532
Tell me a good cop story.

1516
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:14,267
You mean a story about
a good cop

1517
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:17,170
or an interesting story
about a police officer.

1518
01:21:17,172 --> 01:21:18,607
It's up to you.

1519
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:22,876
I wanna hear something amusing
to distract me from my problems.

1520
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:26,045
What problems? You have like the
perfect wife.

1521
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:29,351
The perfect kid.
Good business.

1522
01:21:31,019 --> 01:21:32,888
I'll tell you after.

1523
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:35,255
Let me think.

1524
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:36,990
[clears throat]

1525
01:21:36,992 --> 01:21:38,358
So, about 15 years ago,

1526
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,293
there's this kid,
goes to Alice town.

1527
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:42,428
Hadn't been to school
in a month.

1528
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:44,030
Well, the parents were
at their wits' ends.

1529
01:21:44,032 --> 01:21:46,966
So, I decided to follow the kid
for a day.

1530
01:21:46,968 --> 01:21:48,601
After a while,
we get to this building

1531
01:21:48,603 --> 01:21:50,003
I've never been in before.

1532
01:21:50,005 --> 01:21:52,438
Round the corner up uh,
Main and Parker.

1533
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:53,506
You know where am I?

1534
01:21:53,508 --> 01:21:55,208
You're at the library.

1535
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:56,242
Bingo!

1536
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:58,044
So, I didn't read much
back then.

1537
01:21:58,046 --> 01:22:02,282
I follow him up the stairs
to a library carrel in the back

1538
01:22:02,284 --> 01:22:04,117
and I'm thinking,
he's gotta be doing

1539
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:05,051
drugs back there, right?

1540
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:07,220
It's the perfect place.
Isolated.

1541
01:22:07,222 --> 01:22:08,288
But you know what he's got?

1542
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:11,991
Uh, books I'd imagine.
I mean that's the obvious thing.

1543
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:12,558
One thick book.

1544
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,061
He's in the middle
of reading "Infinite Jest."

1545
01:22:15,063 --> 01:22:16,562
Have you ever read of it?

1546
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:17,697
Now, you're making this up.

1547
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:19,399
He's reading "Infinite Jest."

1548
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:21,401
He says he can't read it at home

1549
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:23,636
because he's got five siblings
to babysit.

1550
01:22:23,638 --> 01:22:25,138
He can't read it at school cause
his

1551
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:26,272
buddies will make fun of him.

1552
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:28,942
So, he skips school
to read in peace.

1553
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:31,311
This book takes a lot
of concentration.

1554
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:32,378
He says. "Listen, hombre,"

1555
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:36,082
he says, "there's nothing
for me in school."

1556
01:22:36,084 --> 01:22:37,250
Everything is in this book.

1557
01:22:37,252 --> 01:22:41,187
I'm guessing, he's Hispanic, by
your use of the word hombre.

1558
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:42,322
So, I haul his ass
back to school.

1559
01:22:42,324 --> 01:22:45,458
And the principal asks
what should his punishment be.

1560
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:47,160
And I ask him how long
is it gonna take him

1561
01:22:47,162 --> 01:22:49,662
to finish his book?
He says, "A couple of weeks."

1562
01:22:49,664 --> 01:22:50,663
So, I suggest,

1563
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:54,502
two-week library suspension
for delinquency.

1564
01:22:56,204 --> 01:22:56,669
You...

1565
01:22:56,671 --> 01:22:59,605
You're definitely
making this up.

1566
01:22:59,607 --> 01:23:01,174
Admit it.

1567
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:02,041
What...

1568
01:23:02,043 --> 01:23:04,143
The troubled youth
did not skip school

1569
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:06,546
to read "Infinite Jest."

1570
01:23:06,548 --> 01:23:09,148
I'm not making it up, AJ.

1571
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:10,717
Yeah, really.

1572
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:12,318
Are you kidding?

1573
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,553
I swear to God.

1574
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:16,589
[laughs]

1575
01:23:16,591 --> 01:23:17,690
Oh, God...

1576
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:18,458
I was just...

1577
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:19,726
I wanted to...
you seemed depressed.

1578
01:23:19,728 --> 01:23:23,363
I wanted to give you a story
with a little uplift.

1579
01:23:23,365 --> 01:23:25,398
AJ:
Ah, thanks man.

1580
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,135
Thanks very much.

1581
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:31,239
So, what did you want
to tell me, by the way?

1582
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:44,450
LAMBIASE: I want
you to know I love you.

1583
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:45,718
And I don't judge you
for anything

1584
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:48,256
you might have done in the past.

1585
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:53,395
I know about the bag
in the closet.

1586
01:23:56,464 --> 01:23:59,234
I know that the book's in there.

1587
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:04,739
I don't know how it got there
and I don't need to know either.

1588
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:08,410
The book is ruined.

1589
01:24:09,511 --> 01:24:15,116
But even a damaged Tamerlane
must still be worth something.

1590
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:18,186
AJ and Amy need the money.

1591
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:23,391
Why do they need the money?

1592
01:24:24,659 --> 01:24:26,628
AJ has cancer.

1593
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:31,566
The way I see it, we wipe the
book of fingerprints,

1594
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,434
put it in an envelope,
and return it.

1595
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:38,206
No one has to know
where or who it came from.

1596
01:24:44,412 --> 01:24:46,514
ISMAY:
How long have you known?

1597
01:24:46,681 --> 01:24:50,218
Since the first time
I came to your house.

1598
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:52,251
And you weren't upset?
You didn't turn me in?

1599
01:24:52,253 --> 01:24:54,823
It's none of my business, Izzie.

1600
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:59,192
I didn't come to your home
as an officer of the law.

1601
01:24:59,194 --> 01:25:01,394
Shouldn't be going through
your stuff.

1602
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:04,232
I figured there must
have been a story.

1603
01:25:05,233 --> 01:25:07,402
[sniffles]

1604
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:13,541
I wanna tell you what happened.

1605
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:16,111
I don't need to know.

1606
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:19,180
I want you to know.

1607
01:25:28,556 --> 01:25:29,822
The first time
that Marian Wallace

1608
01:25:29,824 --> 01:25:33,161
came to see me,
I was five months pregnant.

1609
01:25:33,294 --> 01:25:36,562
ISMAY: She had Maya with
her, the baby was about two.

1610
01:25:36,564 --> 01:25:40,166
And she said that,
"Maya was Daniel's daughter."

1611
01:25:40,168 --> 01:25:43,603
And I said...
And I'm not proud of this...

1612
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:44,770
"How do I know you're
not lying?"

1613
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:46,472
You think you're the first one
to come around here,

1614
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:49,475
and say that
you've had Daniel's child.

1615
01:25:49,477 --> 01:25:51,244
She kept apologizing.

1616
01:25:51,246 --> 01:25:53,513
She said, "The baby
doesn't have to a part

1617
01:25:53,515 --> 01:25:55,348
of Daniel Parish's life."

1618
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:57,683
She kept calling him
by his first and last name.

1619
01:25:57,685 --> 01:25:59,352
Cause she was a fan, you see.

1620
01:25:59,354 --> 01:26:02,321
The baby doesn't have to be
in Daniel Parish's life.

1621
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:04,924
We won't ever bother you again,
I swear to God.

1622
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:06,492
We just need a little money
t[Maya cries]d.

1623
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:07,927
MAYA:
Mama, mama.

1624
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:09,295
To move on.

1625
01:26:09,297 --> 01:26:11,931
He said he would help, and now I
can't find him anywhere.

1626
01:26:11,933 --> 01:26:13,432
Mama, mama, mama...

1627
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:15,303
He's travelling.

1628
01:26:16,271 --> 01:26:19,340
I'll talk to him
and see what I can do.

1629
01:26:19,574 --> 01:26:21,874
I talked to Daniel that night
on the phone.

1630
01:26:21,876 --> 01:26:25,847
It was a good call, and I didn't
bring up Marian Wallace.

1631
01:26:26,247 --> 01:26:30,416
I'm gonna be a changed man
once that baby's here.

1632
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:30,850
[scoffs]

1633
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:32,652
ISMAY: [scoffs] I
had heard that before.

1634
01:26:32,654 --> 01:26:34,320
No, I'm serious.

1635
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:35,955
I'm definitely
gonna travel less.

1636
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:38,391
I'm gonna stay at home,
I'll write more,

1637
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:40,426
ISMAY: I decided right
thenu and and there...

1638
01:26:40,428 --> 01:26:43,831
that I would take care of the
problem with Marian Wallace.

1639
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:47,602
I would find a way
to buy her off.

1640
01:26:48,336 --> 01:26:51,437
Down the hill, my sister had
been dead for over a year,

1641
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:55,575
and her husband was steadily
drinking himself to death.

1642
01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:56,509
Hello, dead wife.

1643
01:26:56,511 --> 01:27:01,616
ISMAY: Out of obligation to her,
I would check on AJ some nights.

1644
01:27:02,617 --> 01:27:03,683
Come on.

1645
01:27:03,685 --> 01:27:06,588
[grunts]

1646
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:13,693
ISMAY: People always
thought we were rich.

1647
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:16,998
But Daniel spent every dollar
we made.

1648
01:27:17,532 --> 01:27:20,868
I saw Tamerlane that night.
And I thought...

1649
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:24,639
this could solve everything.

1650
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:27,940
The next day, everyone
is looking for Tamerlane.

1651
01:27:27,942 --> 01:27:31,012
Oh hey, I'm looking
for Marian Wallace.

1652
01:27:31,846 --> 01:27:33,246
Thank you.

1653
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:35,750
ISMAY:
But I've gone into Cambridge.

1654
01:27:39,454 --> 01:27:40,888
Here.

1655
01:27:43,424 --> 01:27:46,359
You can sell it.
It's worth a lot of money.

1656
01:27:46,361 --> 01:27:46,859
Is it hot?

1657
01:27:46,861 --> 01:27:49,829
No, it belongs to Daniel,
and he wants you to have it,

1658
01:27:49,831 --> 01:27:52,565
but you can never say
where you got it.

1659
01:27:52,567 --> 01:27:54,033
You can take it
to an auction house,

1660
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:55,668
or a rare-books dealer.

1661
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:59,807
Just claim you found it
in a used-books bin.

1662
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:03,442
I don't hear from Marian
Wallace again for a while,

1663
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:07,315
and I think
maybe that's the end of it.

1664
01:28:07,882 --> 01:28:09,382
But of course, it isn't.

1665
01:28:09,384 --> 01:28:11,350
She says she's gone
to every auction house

1666
01:28:11,352 --> 01:28:13,352
and rare book dealer
in the Boston area,

1667
01:28:13,354 --> 01:28:14,887
and none of them want to deal
with the book

1668
01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:17,623
because it doesn't have
a provenance.

1669
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:18,724
And the cops have been calling

1670
01:28:18,726 --> 01:28:21,460
about a stolen copy
of Tamerlane.

1671
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:23,865
What am I supposed to do
with this?

1672
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:28,334
Have you ever read "Tamerlane",
Mrs. Parish?

1673
01:28:28,336 --> 01:28:29,702
It's so sad.

1674
01:28:29,704 --> 01:28:31,904
It's about this
Turkish conqueror who

1675
01:28:31,906 --> 01:28:33,639
trades in the love of his life,

1676
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:36,010
this poor peasant girl,
for power.

1677
01:28:36,444 --> 01:28:38,778
Do you fancy yourself
some poor peasant girl,

1678
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:40,713
and I'm the mean wife
who is keeping you

1679
01:28:40,715 --> 01:28:43,049
from the love of your life?

1680
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:44,485
No.

1681
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:50,024
And the worst of it is,
I knew what I was doing.

1682
01:28:50,792 --> 01:28:53,359
He came to my college
for a reading.

1683
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:56,896
I loved his book,
and when I slept with him.

1684
01:28:56,898 --> 01:29:00,066
I had read his author biography
a hundred times

1685
01:29:00,068 --> 01:29:02,804
and I knew that he was married.

1686
01:29:04,772 --> 01:29:07,408
I've made so many mistakes.

1687
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:11,879
I can't help you.

1688
01:29:13,815 --> 01:29:14,580
[Maya cries]

1689
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:17,616
ISMAY: I'm thinking I'll just
slip into AJ's apartment tomorrow

1690
01:29:17,618 --> 01:29:20,052
or the next day and return it.

1691
01:29:20,054 --> 01:29:22,557
That's when I notice...

1692
01:29:37,839 --> 01:29:39,004
The way I see it,

1693
01:29:39,006 --> 01:29:44,412
you saved AJ Fikry's life
by stealing that manuscript.

1694
01:29:45,646 --> 01:29:47,815
What kind of cop are you?

1695
01:29:49,117 --> 01:29:50,952
The old kind.

1696
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:56,023
AJ:
Hey.

1697
01:29:56,591 --> 01:29:58,624
This was leaning on your door.

1698
01:29:58,626 --> 01:30:00,926
Hmm. Probably another galley.

1699
01:30:00,928 --> 01:30:04,065
Don't say that.
Could be the next big thing.

1700
01:30:04,499 --> 01:30:07,099
So, what's...
what's good in crime?

1701
01:30:07,101 --> 01:30:09,535
I need something new
for Chief's Choice.

1702
01:30:09,537 --> 01:30:11,470
Hmm.

1703
01:30:11,472 --> 01:30:13,808
Maybe this?

1704
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:18,811
Smart, sexy, and spell binding.

1705
01:30:18,813 --> 01:30:20,181
Yeah.

1706
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:22,448
AUCTIONEER:
Lot 2200.

1707
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:24,884
A last-minute addition
to this afternoon's auction

1708
01:30:24,886 --> 01:30:25,918
and a rare opportunity

1709
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,720
for the vintage
books connoisseur.

1710
01:30:27,722 --> 01:30:30,689
Tamerlane and Other Poems
by Edgar Allan Poe.

1711
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:34,627
Written when Poe was 18
and attributed to 'A Bostonian.'

1712
01:30:34,629 --> 01:30:37,129
Only 50 printed at the time.

1713
01:30:37,131 --> 01:30:38,931
Tamerlane
will be the crown jewel

1714
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:41,167
in any serious
rare books collection.

1715
01:30:41,169 --> 01:30:43,035
This copy shows some wear
on the spine

1716
01:30:43,037 --> 01:30:45,171
and some markings of crayon
on the cover.

1717
01:30:45,173 --> 01:30:48,040
This damage should not
in any way spoil the beauty

1718
01:30:48,042 --> 01:30:49,975
or diminish the rarity
of the object,

1719
01:30:49,977 --> 01:30:52,077
and this cannot be overstated.

1720
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:54,780
Let the bidding begin
at $ 20,000.

1721
01:30:54,782 --> 01:30:56,882
Do I see 20,000?
I see 20,000.

1722
01:30:56,884 --> 01:30:59,051
Do I see 25? 25, 25, 25...

1723
01:30:59,053 --> 01:31:00,052
I see 25!

1724
01:31:00,054 --> 01:31:02,657
Do I see 30? 30, 30, 30...

1725
01:31:04,058 --> 01:31:07,962
"The Late Bloomer" really
was a bunch of hokum.

1726
01:31:08,763 --> 01:31:09,929
Do you remember
when Freedman writes

1727
01:31:09,931 --> 01:31:13,534
how you can't truly describe
a hospital room?

1728
01:31:13,935 --> 01:31:15,000
When the person you love
is in it

1729
01:31:15,002 --> 01:31:18,471
that it's too painful
to be described?

1730
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:20,806
How did we ever find
that poetic?

1731
01:31:20,808 --> 01:31:23,642
No, seriously,
I'm disgusted with us.

1732
01:31:23,644 --> 01:31:26,245
At this stage in my life,
I'm with every person

1733
01:31:26,247 --> 01:31:27,713
who never wanted to read
that book.

1734
01:31:27,715 --> 01:31:29,515
I'm with the designer
who put the feet

1735
01:31:29,517 --> 01:31:31,817
and flowers on the cover.
Because you know what?

1736
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,719
You can describe
a hospital room.

1737
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:35,523
It's gray.

1738
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:38,791
And the art is the worst art
that you've ever seen.

1739
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:41,026
And everything smells like
you're trying to cover up

1740
01:31:41,028 --> 01:31:42,895
the smell of piss.

1741
01:31:42,897 --> 01:31:44,632
AJ:
Amy...

1742
01:31:45,132 --> 01:31:48,002
you loved "The Late Bloomer."

1743
01:31:48,603 --> 01:31:51,837
Yeah, but I didn't want to be
in some stupid play version

1744
01:31:51,839 --> 01:31:53,941
of it in my 40s.

1745
01:31:57,678 --> 01:31:59,280
AJ:
Hey.

1746
01:32:04,852 --> 01:32:06,220
[grunts]

1747
01:32:06,287 --> 01:32:09,724
You really think I should have
this surgery?

1748
01:32:10,892 --> 01:32:12,992
Yes, I do.

1749
01:32:12,994 --> 01:32:14,193
But is it worth it

1750
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:17,999
for maybe two more years
that are likely to be crappy?

1751
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:21,836
- It is.
- ATTENDANT: Mr. Fikry...

1752
01:32:22,703 --> 01:32:24,003
Just...

1753
01:32:24,005 --> 01:32:27,172
[indistinct chatter]

1754
01:32:27,174 --> 01:32:28,910
I love you.

1755
01:32:31,746 --> 01:32:32,978
I want to leave you with
something more

1756
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:36,817
cleverer than that,
but it's all I know.

1757
01:32:40,154 --> 01:32:43,190
ATTENDANT:
Mr. Fikry, it's time.

1758
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:51,864
[♪]

1759
01:32:51,866 --> 01:32:53,267
Dad.

1760
01:33:16,624 --> 01:33:19,892
MAYA: In the last days
of the bookseller's life,

1761
01:33:19,894 --> 01:33:22,795
reading became difficult.

1762
01:33:22,797 --> 01:33:25,798
Novels had become impossible.

1763
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:26,999
If he tried very hard,

1764
01:33:27,001 --> 01:33:30,137
he could still make it
through a short story.

1765
01:33:30,638 --> 01:33:34,275
The daughter asked him,
if he was afraid.

1766
01:33:34,809 --> 01:33:36,642
"Not of dying," he said,

1767
01:33:36,644 --> 01:33:39,280
but a little of this part
I'm in.

1768
01:33:40,147 --> 01:33:42,883
Every day there is less of me.

1769
01:33:43,851 --> 01:33:49,090
But you're here right now
and so I am glad to be here.

1770
01:33:50,224 --> 01:33:52,159
Even without books.

1771
01:33:56,097 --> 01:34:00,201
[snoring]

1772
01:34:01,335 --> 01:34:03,270
Shall I read to you, Dad?

1773
01:34:04,338 --> 01:34:06,207
Hm.

1774
01:34:08,909 --> 01:34:12,680
MAYA: Ah, said Dolly,
with soothing gravity.

1775
01:34:12,847 --> 01:34:17,149
Said the night and the morning,
and the sleeping and the waking,

1776
01:34:17,151 --> 01:34:19,385
and the rain in the harvest.

1777
01:34:19,387 --> 01:34:21,820
One goes and the other comes.

1778
01:34:21,822 --> 01:34:25,292
And we know nothing,
how or where.

1779
01:34:32,099 --> 01:34:33,701
Dad?

1780
01:34:35,202 --> 01:34:36,837
Dad...

1781
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:48,247
AJ:
Who the hell are you?

1782
01:34:48,249 --> 01:34:50,284
MAYA:
Maya.

1783
01:34:50,918 --> 01:34:53,821
Good morning, cherry tree!

1784
01:34:54,155 --> 01:34:57,058
Good morning, bookstore!

1785
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:01,694
[AJ crying]

1786
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:04,031
MAYA:
Why are you crying?

1787
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:07,001
AJ:
I was reading.

1788
01:35:12,373 --> 01:35:17,978
"A Trip to the Beach"
by Maya Tamerlane Fikry.

1789
01:35:19,313 --> 01:35:22,149
And that was written
by a writer.

1790
01:35:25,052 --> 01:35:29,123
MAYA: And while I can't
say it was a happily ever after,

1791
01:35:30,357 --> 01:35:32,493
it was the end.

1792
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:51,445
MAYA:
I'm not here.

1793
01:36:01,288 --> 01:36:04,959
I need to ask your opinion
about something.

1794
01:36:07,128 --> 01:36:10,197
I'm thinking about taking
a new job.

1795
01:36:11,532 --> 01:36:14,802
It would mean a lot less travel,

1796
01:36:15,269 --> 01:36:17,371
a little more money.

1797
01:36:17,505 --> 01:36:20,205
And we could spend
more time together

1798
01:36:20,207 --> 01:36:22,977
because I wouldn't be
on the road so much.

1799
01:36:23,377 --> 01:36:25,813
You mean we'll leave Alice?

1800
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,282
It's not that far.

1801
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:30,149
It's just New York.

1802
01:36:30,151 --> 01:36:33,788
We can come back
anytime we want.

1803
01:36:33,988 --> 01:36:37,122
I know it's impossible
to get here.

1804
01:36:37,124 --> 01:36:39,024
It is impossible.

1805
01:36:39,026 --> 01:36:40,528
[chuckles]

1806
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:46,801
I won't take it
if you don't want me to.

1807
01:36:48,002 --> 01:36:51,138
I know how much you love
this place.

1808
01:36:52,306 --> 01:36:54,542
I love this place, too.

1809
01:36:56,177 --> 01:36:57,878
Okay.

1810
01:37:04,285 --> 01:37:06,854
I need to see your face.

1811
01:37:12,393 --> 01:37:14,028
Okay?

1812
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:19,133
What will happen to the store?

1813
01:37:25,206 --> 01:37:27,174
[sniffles]

1814
01:37:31,178 --> 01:37:33,145
End of an era.

1815
01:37:33,147 --> 01:37:34,079
Yeah.

1816
01:37:34,081 --> 01:37:37,418
Amelia said she tried
to get someone to run it but...

1817
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:39,618
Here's a crazy thought.

1818
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:42,056
What if you and I took it over?

1819
01:37:43,457 --> 01:37:47,194
In this economy,
that is a crazy thought.

1820
01:37:48,062 --> 01:37:49,563
Probably so.

1821
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:52,231
You want to get something
to eat?

1822
01:37:52,233 --> 01:37:54,034
Yeah.

1823
01:37:55,069 --> 01:38:00,138
[♪]

1824
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:01,573
But what if we did?

1825
01:38:01,575 --> 01:38:03,141
I mean, I've got savings

1826
01:38:03,143 --> 01:38:05,410
and a pretty good pension
about to come in,

1827
01:38:05,412 --> 01:38:06,311
and so do you.

1828
01:38:06,313 --> 01:38:10,150
AJ said the summer people
bought a lot of books.

1829
01:38:10,351 --> 01:38:14,219
The summer people
have E-readers now.

1830
01:38:14,221 --> 01:38:15,320
That's true.

1831
01:38:15,322 --> 01:38:17,892
- ISMAY: Thank you.
- It is.

1832
01:38:24,064 --> 01:38:26,164
We could open a cafe, too.

1833
01:38:26,166 --> 01:38:29,436
That would probably help
with the bottom line.

1834
01:38:30,037 --> 01:38:32,604
AJ used to talk about that
all the time.

1835
01:38:32,606 --> 01:38:34,973
Turn the basement
into a theatre space.

1836
01:38:34,975 --> 01:38:36,942
That way, the author events
don't have to happen

1837
01:38:36,944 --> 01:38:38,210
right in the middle
of the store.

1838
01:38:38,212 --> 01:38:41,148
Your theater background
would be great for that.

1839
01:38:41,682 --> 01:38:43,484
[chuckles]

1840
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:48,353
Are you sure you're up for this?

1841
01:38:48,355 --> 01:38:50,389
We aren't super young.

1842
01:38:50,391 --> 01:38:53,160
But we're not old yet, either.

1843
01:38:56,096 --> 01:38:57,462
I've lived in Alice
my whole life.

1844
01:38:57,464 --> 01:38:58,964
It's the only place
that I've ever known.

1845
01:38:58,966 --> 01:39:02,503
It's a nice place,
I intend to keep it that way.

1846
01:39:03,504 --> 01:39:07,241
A place ain't a place
without a bookstore, Izzie.

1847
01:39:11,445 --> 01:39:14,148
[chuckles]

1848
01:39:29,697 --> 01:39:37,697
[♪]

1849
01:40:10,604 --> 01:40:13,405
Hi there. Um, one for Alice
Island, please.

1850
01:40:13,407 --> 01:40:15,407
- One-way or round trip?
- JACOB: Round trip.

1851
01:40:15,409 --> 01:40:18,143
- Aw some, thank you so much!
- TICKET SELLER: Thank you.

1852
01:40:18,145 --> 01:40:26,145
[♪]

1853
01:41:03,223 --> 01:41:04,790
LAMBIASE:
Welcome.

1854
01:41:04,792 --> 01:41:06,794
Mr. Lambiase.

1855
01:41:08,629 --> 01:41:11,430
Have I got a book for you!

1856
01:41:11,432 --> 01:41:19,432
