1
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:21,230
ONLY THE BRAVE

2
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,266
Sunday morning, December 7.

3
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:45,272
I was on a weekend training Hawaiian Territorial Defence
in Scofield.

4
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:51,570
Zero Japanese attacked our P-40 at the airport
by up to 7 fleet.

5
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,156
We were an easy target.

6
00:01:55,991 --> 00:02:00,162
Senzaki Steve and I spent the whole night
carrying dead and wounded.

7
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:05,000
On Monday, the FBI
came after my father.

8
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,670
He stood in the doorway,
Best dressed in a suit.

9
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,131
I was still in uniform ...

10
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,592
covered with blood
my colleagues in the Navy.

11
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:15,677
He shook me and said ...

12
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,389
"Never forget
I was born here. "

13
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,100
Then he went away

14
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:29,650
My father came to Hawaii in 1905
and established a Buddhist temple Hongonji.

15
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,027
When I was little ...

16
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,031
I saw him in a room of meditation,
sometimes sitting for several hours.

17
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,118
I asked:
"What are you doing here?"

18
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,456
He replied:
"I look at another world."

19
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,209
"What a world, Dad?"

20
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:53,465
I replied: "Do not worry, Jimmy,
someday you'll know. "

21
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,011
I thought that this day has come
when the army ...

22
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,055
after Pearl Harbor
gave us a chance ...

23
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:03,517
a chance to defend
our homes and country.

24
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,980
I thought it was the day
where we have landed in Africa

25
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,524
where it first stood
against the Third Reich.

26
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:14,236
I thought it was the day
where we have landed in Italy

27
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:17,072
and began to roll
battle for battle.

28
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,075
Only I do not know ...

29
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,744
it is that I have not tried
find another world ...

30
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,622
Another world was gone.

31
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,587
Wahiawa,
HAWAII, 1953

32
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,046
Jimmy? Is this you?

33
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,051
Jimmy?

34
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,097
You came early.
How was work today?

35
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,573
Jimmy ...

36
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,260
I know I've lost ...

37
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,518
I do not know how to find you.

38
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,023
Tell me what I do!

39
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,260
Nome goes too fast.

40
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,942
Prepare for attack
start in a minute.

41
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,112
We need to get to the train station.
YES ...

42
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,281
insures your branch.

43
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,199
Yuk, your squad attacks.

44
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:27,953
Take the left flank,
Catch Nomura and tell him to wait.

45
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,497
Zaki, reserve.

46
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:06,408
1 ... 2 ... 3 ... 4 ...

47
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:12,539
5 ... 6 ... 7 ...

48
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:17,920
8 ... 9 ... 10.

49
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,173
Ready or not, here I come!

50
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,362
Coming.
Hear us!

51
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,251
I've found!

52
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,754
Come here.

53
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:07,386
Always remember
that Daddy loves you, right?

54
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,987
Forward! Go!

55
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,949
-Zaki!
- I protect you, sir!

56
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,286
Excuse me, sergeant,
I thought it was a purely ...

57
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,204
Easy, nome,
Doctor on the road.

58
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,086
-Someone else off an?
-Not everyone survives.

59
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,342
Sergeant ...

60
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,849
Sergeant ... Tell me ...

61
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,226
Nome!

62
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,861
Hide and watch.

63
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,301
-Who is it?
-A local priest.

64
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,054
Francois Jordan.
My sister, Rene.

65
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:15,973
Who are you?

66
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,600
Sao Americans?

67
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,437
He says,
that were waiting for us.

68
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,401
You do not look at Americans.

69
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,529
Doc.
Take them to the rear.

70
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,448
Take care of yourself.

71
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,450
Sure, Sarge.

72
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,458
All right.

73
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:47,546
second, third and fourth platoon
take a position.

74
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:49,464
this will take you 40 minutes.

75
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,095
Yuk, take a left.

76
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,224
Yes, walk around around
and secure the next street.

77
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:01,977
Zaki, take a right.

78
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:06,899
Purify these buildings.
Four teams.

79
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,527
Remember, guests from the station
have friends in town.

80
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,989
Prepare to fight in close contact
Watch out for snipers.

81
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,661
Mue, find a command post
where we can drink.

82
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,249
Forward.

83
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:28,253
Who leads you into battle?

84
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,005
Yuk was a natural leader.

85
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:32,841
He demanded respect and showed it to his subordinates.

86
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,677
Zaki I had known since childhood.

87
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:38,680
He knew what I think
even before I thought about it.

88
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,350
and if I needed more firepower ...

89
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,018
Nobody was better than Yes.

90
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,664
-Jimmy!
-All right.

91
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:48,667
Drop your weapon!

92
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:02,556
Grenade!

93
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,487
Cease fire! Cease fire!

94
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:41,512
Come here. Come on.

95
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,809
Are you hurt?

96
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:51,980
Mom and Dad?

97
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:56,735
Come on, come on.

98
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:35,858
Frank? Frank!

99
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,443
Where is he?

100
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:39,778
Where is he?

101
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,238
at 11 am, third floor.

102
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:52,207
Prepare a machine gun!

103
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,836
Jimmy, we have company!

104
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:56,712
right behind you!

105
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:00,174
I'll come up.
Cover me. Horse.

106
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:08,140
Stay here.
Do not move. Become.

107
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:15,814
Forward!

108
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,589
Sniper!
Third floor.

109
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,927
Left corner, third floor.
Left corner, third floor.

110
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,275
Damn.

111
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:09,952
Shielding Fire!

112
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,708
Forward.
First, go!

113
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:05,716
Panzerfaust!

114
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,844
Take cover!

115
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,515
Take up defensive positions!

116
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,048
Sergeant!

117
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:56,517
Warning!

118
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,999
Everything will be fine.
Everything will be fine.

119
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:46,275
Relax.

120
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,912
-Looks like you got the mascot.
-Yes.

121
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,248
Does not leave it on the step.

122
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,834
-Where are we?
- The best bar in town.

123
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:05,294
How's your head?

124
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:08,005
The new helmet?

125
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:09,965
This helmet Sato.

126
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,634
You're lucky.

127
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,638
You look like
Who wants a drink.

128
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:19,850
Yes, it looks like
dog bite to it.

129
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,394
Say what?

130
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,062
Dog ... dog.

131
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,274
A dog bite you?
When?

132
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:29,067
No, this is ...

133
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:32,070
Forget it.

134
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:36,074
You say strange things.

135
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:40,162
You know, let's drink.
-Hey ...

136
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:43,040
Kauai, bring me one of those bottles.

137
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,082
Wait.

138
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,292
-No.
-No.

139
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:49,296
Because the loser won relaunch?
Fall.

140
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:50,756
Thank you.

141
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,012
Leave all worries to us.

142
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,349
-Where is Skipper?
-Headquarters.

143
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,144
Fukushima looks bad.

144
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:09,066
His brother, Dave, has a scratch.
The doctor took up Watada.

145
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:10,317
A fragment of a grenade fragment.

146
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,945
Minami barely escaped.

147
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:15,864
Rookie off an?

148
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:18,075
Only a fresh wound.

149
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:21,203
Hey, it's called "superficial"
not fresh.

150
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:25,040
Why is it called?
Superficial wound?

151
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,167
Tell him, Doc.

152
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:32,172
As the ball just drasnela skin.
Not damaged artery or internal organs.

153
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:35,050
Thank you, Doc.

154
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:38,846
Better Call the chaplain.

155
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:40,222
Ichi ...

156
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:42,558
Get the chaplain.

157
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,271
You have a hard head.

158
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:49,773
Yes, your helmet adopted
most impact.

159
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,150
That is why I said that you were lucky.

160
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:53,652
How is the situation?

161
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:56,154
They were well prepared.

162
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,616
You were right.
They were waiting for us.

163
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:16,425
Is this not beautiful?

164
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:23,265
Heaven.

165
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,687
When changes from orange
to red ...

166
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:31,899
everything seems like it should be.

167
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,031
All right, Freddy?

168
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:42,993
I love you.

169
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:47,498
I know. I love you too.

170
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,963
All my cousins
are 100 battalion.

171
00:20:56,507 --> 00:20:58,133
I also zaciaglem.

172
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,146
Do you understand me?

173
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,578
when the second and third platoon
occurred from behind ...

174
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:29,998
and the fourth from the west,
did not even realize what hit them

175
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:31,500
Hey, Jimmy, are you okay?

176
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:36,755
What are the losses?

177
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:39,383
The second platoon has two dead,
and seven wounded.

178
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:41,176
The third and fourth without a loss.

179
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:44,847
Germany quickly withdrew today.
They had to go east.

180
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:49,351
Command reports 36 dead enemies
and 12 prisoners.

181
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,696
Let's make some money.
Let's go.

182
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:07,953
-Hey, Yuk ...
"Yes?"

183
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:11,206
The sniper had you
at gunpoint.

184
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:14,501
I could not leave there Fukushima.

185
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:16,795
Podjoles great risk.

186
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:20,007
I was ready to take that risk.

187
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:23,385
He acted the same way you, Jimmy.

188
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:29,391
I'm going to the store,
take the ammunition.

189
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:31,518
-Hey, Yuk ...
"Yes?"

190
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:36,815
We know that you're a tough guy
We do not need to prove.

191
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:40,736
See you soon.

192
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,424
Doc, doc,
stopped breathing.

193
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:13,352
I have seen many times
how my people go.

194
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:18,440
Watched with them
to their last breath.

195
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,070
I tried to hold
flowing guts.

196
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:28,450
The arms and legs hanging
on pieces of skin and muscle.

197
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:32,663
They looked at me knowing
that death is coming ...

198
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:37,584
and everyone was looking for, they thought
or wanted to be with them ...

199
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:39,962
were their relatives.

200
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:44,466
This fear,
look for unforgettable moments of life ...

201
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:49,763
beautiful moments,
The last chance to see life.

202
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:21,712
Do not you tired of reading this over and over again?

203
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:23,964
No.

204
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:27,843
How's the arm?

205
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:32,347
The doctor said
that keep my guardian angel.

206
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,433
It was only a fragment grenade.

207
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:39,354
This is your angel?

208
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:45,027
It must be unique.

209
00:24:58,499 --> 00:25:00,000
I bought in New Jersey.

210
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:05,589
I regret that I did not give her
him before leaving.

211
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:19,311
Do not worry, she'll understand.

212
00:25:21,355 --> 00:25:22,481
You think?

213
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:25,234
Yes.

214
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:41,083
Hey, Sergeant ...

215
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:45,003
All right?

216
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:54,847
Nice ring.

217
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:19,246
Doc ...

218
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:30,799
Are you sure you want to do this?

219
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:35,971
I think so.

220
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:39,141
I leave it exposed the queen.

221
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:43,770
Now you're a doctor.
You are no longer young.

222
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:48,483
Henry Kobayashi went.
Is 37 years old.

223
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,613
How could you decide
without talking to me?

224
00:26:58,035 --> 00:27:00,913
-Good move.
-We need you here.

225
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:08,253
Shah.

226
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:17,387
You have to learn to play
more offensively.

227
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,101
Check mate.

228
00:27:40,744 --> 00:27:43,914
This camp sends
47 volunteers.

229
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:46,333
Many are from Seattle.

230
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:50,921
I saw how they grew up.

231
00:27:51,547 --> 00:27:53,549
Involved with their families.

232
00:27:54,258 --> 00:27:56,051
We're your family.

233
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,559
Who will teach me
play more offensively?

234
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:41,972
Doc.

235
00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:45,559
What happened, Jimmy?

236
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:48,979
Wrong knowledge.

237
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,274
Jesus, I still bleed.

238
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:55,736
Sit down.

239
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:02,493
But, Doctor ...
-Shut up.

240
00:29:05,496 --> 00:29:08,665
Hey Doc, check whether
have a brain.

241
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:12,377
What are you talking about? He is
of Wahiawa, he has no brain.

242
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,963
Shut up.
I have a cousin in Wahiawa.

243
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:16,048
Raise.

244
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:17,799
He also has no brain?

245
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,843
Who said it was "he"?

246
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:23,388
pity that it is stupid and ugly.
Raise.

247
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:26,099
You're talking about my cousin.

248
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:29,144
Sure. Country girl

249
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:30,270
and her cousin.

250
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:32,648
It must also be ugly.

251
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:34,650
As soon as you przywale.

252
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:37,569
Hey, we play poker or not?

253
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:39,238
Sergeant, and you?

254
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:45,285
I lived in the country before I moved
to Kalihi, and I was full of pretty girls.

255
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:48,747
No. I want to know if you enter
or not.

256
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:50,666
I walk.

257
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:56,421
Sergeant, you have a Japanese name,
but do not look Japanese?

258
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,007
My mother is
half Filipina and half hawajka.

259
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:01,218
You are a true hybrid.

260
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:02,886
This is not funny.
My mother is Chinese.

261
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,973
I thought that in this unit
serve only the Japanese themselves.

262
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:11,353
What women do you like? Chinese women, or hawajki FILIPINKI?

263
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:14,064
Glupolu, my wife is Japanese.

264
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:18,026
All taste the same.
To me it makes no difference.

265
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:22,322
Girls! Food!
Who now falls?

266
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:24,116
Now it's your turn.

267
00:30:29,163 --> 00:30:30,664
I forgot whose turn.

268
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:35,794
If you head aches,
Take these two.

269
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:39,256
It's not a headache, Doc.

270
00:30:40,132 --> 00:30:43,177
I'm going to Headquarters,
Check out our supplies.

271
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:46,513
Relax.

272
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:54,396
Check.

273
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:56,523
Good rate. Check.

274
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:59,318
"Check" is not at stake.

275
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:03,906
-Are you in or not?
-I.

276
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:08,076
Do not think too much,
you are no longer in the country.

277
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:11,288
Shut up.
Check.

278
00:31:11,747 --> 00:31:14,333
Full, queen of siódemkach.

279
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:17,753
-Damn, I have two pair.

280
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:19,671
Come to daddy.

281
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:22,966
Pair of tens
and a couple of decades.

282
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:26,094
Skórczybyk!

283
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:30,265
Now who has a brain?

284
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:34,353
What do you think, Sergeant?
It has a brain or just lucky?

285
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:36,396
I've never played
the boys from Kalihi.

286
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,190
You know who does not play, right?

287
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:44,279
New game, five cards
go.

288
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:49,576
Are you ready to confess?

289
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:56,959
in this case
give me a drink?

290
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:01,797
Please reverend.
The treats.

291
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:13,851
Jimmy ...

292
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,521
Jimmy ...

293
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:20,941
Mary?

294
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:31,827
Jimmy.

295
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:43,255
Jimmy.

296
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:50,846
Jimmy.

297
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:01,773
Mary?

298
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:07,029
Mary?

299
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,873
Stay away from me.

300
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:20,667
Why?

301
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:23,545
As long as I do not promise anything.

302
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:25,839
What?

303
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,800
If ever I am lost ...

304
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:31,220
You'll find me.

305
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:39,895
Wait ...

306
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:42,356
Wait!

307
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:56,036
I promise.

308
00:33:57,621 --> 00:33:59,331
I always find you.

309
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:46,086
Celebrities.
The mist gave way.

310
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,931
What do you look, Sergeant?

311
00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:02,519
I hear the planes.
I'm sure it ours.

312
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:12,779
Since when have you
nickname "Falcon's Eye"?

313
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:14,740
Huh?

314
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:17,075
Ah, shit.

315
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,496
Excuse me, Sergeant.

316
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:28,086
Dave, your brother Frank ...

317
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:30,672
was a good soldier.

318
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:35,177
Yes. Always ...

319
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:39,890
I always looked after me with.

320
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:44,186
My other brother, George is ...

321
00:35:45,896 --> 00:35:48,690
somewhere in the Pacific
. I just ...

322
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:01,203
I've just learned
that his ship sank.

323
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:06,708
You have one brother in the house, right?

324
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:12,130
Yeah. How do you know?

325
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,174
Frank told me.

326
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:19,930
His name is Danny.

327
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:27,062
He was very sciekly
because he was not accepted.

328
00:36:28,397 --> 00:36:29,648
He has asthma, so ...

329
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:33,026
Dave ...

330
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,615
See how the moon shines
trees?

331
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:41,076
Yes.

332
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:45,247
So I can see you.

333
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:49,918
Agrees to Sergeant.

334
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:53,255
I know it is hard ...

335
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:57,676
but try to have
head on his shoulders, okay?

336
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:06,268
Yes.
I'll go a little sleep.

337
00:37:10,022 --> 00:37:11,273
Goodnight, Sergeant.

338
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:17,529
Good night, Falcon's eye

339
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:31,627
Hurry. Next.

340
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:37,132
Move!

341
00:37:51,605 --> 00:37:52,814
Is this our planes?

342
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:54,983
Funny, is not it?

343
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:01,657
Jimmy, all right?

344
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,621
Yes.

345
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:15,170
Hina talking to you?

346
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:21,134
With every rising of the moon, you see.

347
00:38:22,511 --> 00:38:25,097
With each sunrise, you are born to relaunch.

348
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:30,811
The rest of the body,
preparing for rebirth.

349
00:38:33,564 --> 00:38:36,525
What is it?
The old Hawaiian beliefs?

350
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:41,989
No. I just invented.
But it sounds good, right?

351
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:47,744
Yes.

352
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,711
23h07.

353
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:06,305
Another world.

354
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:11,226
My dad told me
that this is not something you can see.

355
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:15,856
It is pure, innocent,
everything is good.

356
00:39:17,274 --> 00:39:19,568
It is in us,
ready to leave us.

357
00:39:21,153 --> 00:39:23,197
Do not be afraid to look into the darkness ...

358
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:25,949
to take the next step.

359
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:39,463
Purely.

360
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:19,837
About 4 or 5 km.

361
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:32,349
Guess the name of the ship,
who will take us to the mainland.

362
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:33,851
-What?
-S.S. Maui.

363
00:40:34,518 --> 00:40:35,727
Do not talk.

364
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:37,771
At least one of the gods protect you.

365
00:40:39,857 --> 00:40:42,985
Jimmy, I am mestizo.
Do you think that would be fine if I go too?

366
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,989
What are you talking about?
My father grew up with your father.

367
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:50,159
Which is the same as I am Japanese.

368
00:40:50,534 --> 00:40:53,245
-Thoughts?
-Always.

369
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:55,289
Thank you.

370
00:40:56,498 --> 00:40:59,209
-When the Maui sails?
-In two weeks.

371
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:02,880
You with the Territorial Defence, you are always so funny.

372
00:41:05,883 --> 00:41:09,636
Again, the landing was 900m
east of the landing zone, over.

373
00:41:10,387 --> 00:41:13,390
Command wants to talk to the team leader. Reception.

374
00:41:14,391 --> 00:41:19,146
I refuse. The commander is dead
I am now in command. Reception.

375
00:41:20,314 --> 00:41:22,858
I understood, radio silence
until 6:00. Reception.

376
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:24,902
I understood. The end of the reception.

377
00:41:34,953 --> 00:41:36,371
I think they failed.

378
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:42,836
Send a group inquiry, Lieutenant?

379
00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:46,048
We can not afford to lose more people.

380
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:48,509
I give only a proposal sir.

381
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:52,888
Lieutenant ...

382
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:56,975
These boys would be raised to the Lord
as well as to Captain Ford.

383
00:41:57,768 --> 00:41:58,977
Now you are in command.

384
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:03,398
Thanks, Sergeant.

385
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:06,902
We need to conserve ammunition.
Forward rest.

386
00:42:06,985 --> 00:42:07,778
Command.

387
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:18,413
Germany cut off Battalion
Texas 41st

388
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:20,707
5km to the front line.

389
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:22,584
We got orders to pull them.

390
00:42:23,627 --> 00:42:26,588
Put a medical battalion
in the church in the northern part of town.

391
00:42:26,964 --> 00:42:28,757
This is the closest point
where to get going.

392
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:31,510
Is damaged,
but big.

393
00:42:32,386 --> 00:42:35,264
-What about the opponent?
-There is not an official said.

394
00:42:36,056 --> 00:42:38,433
Texas 141 is nailed
on the hill.

395
00:42:39,977 --> 00:42:42,479
We know only that Germany
surrounded them.

396
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:43,772
What do you suggest?

397
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:46,733
Germany are scattered in the area
several kilometers.

398
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:48,861
Maybe one
or two regiments.

399
00:42:50,654 --> 00:42:52,823
How long 1 41 Battalion, is there?

400
00:42:53,574 --> 00:42:56,785
1 43. trying to reach them from
5 days, to no avail.

401
00:42:57,452 --> 00:43:00,080
Will be withdrawn.
Now our turn.

402
00:43:01,582 --> 00:43:02,833
As head, Jimmy?

403
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:06,086
Why do not you wake me?

404
00:43:06,503 --> 00:43:08,213
I said that I did not.

405
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:11,550
The second battalion went two hours ago.

406
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:14,887
A third battalion will begin at 4:00
and the first set off to 5.00

407
00:43:16,305 --> 00:43:17,472
The whole regiment?

408
00:43:18,307 --> 00:43:20,642
I thought Colonel
gave us two days of rest.

409
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:23,562
-General changed his mind.
-To hear last night.

410
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:25,147
What happened, Jimmy?

411
00:43:25,647 --> 00:43:28,650
They tried to make the discharges.
I heard the aircraft when the fog rose.

412
00:43:29,526 --> 00:43:30,903
Dump failed.

413
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:35,324
It does not give us much time.

414
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:38,494
Doc says he needs rest.
I agree.

415
00:43:39,328 --> 00:43:40,120
All right.

416
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:42,831
Jimmy, you're here
great sergeants

417
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,667
Let them be your eyes.

418
00:43:50,088 --> 00:43:54,051
All right. A command post set here
some 500m away.

419
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:57,012
Each company will have an artillery observer ...

420
00:43:57,137 --> 00:43:58,889
but do not expect the support of artillery.

421
00:44:01,225 --> 00:44:04,394
See you at the assembly point
for 30 minutes.

422
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:13,529
Sorry, Jimmy.

423
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:15,948
But I can see better.

424
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:23,705
Sergeant, this is not the same regiment
with which we trained?

425
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:26,124
No, I think
that these are the guests ...

426
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:27,876
who wanted to fight with us in the city.

427
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,712
Yeah, how is this city called?
Hati, or something like that.

428
00:44:30,754 --> 00:44:34,049
Idiot. This was the second division,
and the town was called Sparta.

429
00:44:34,675 --> 00:44:37,636
How should I know?
All white people look the same.

430
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:41,557
Texas 141 has problems.

431
00:44:42,683 --> 00:44:45,561
These include the U.S. Army
and they need our help.

432
00:44:47,604 --> 00:44:49,106
You have 28 minutes.

433
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:14,756
Hey, Jimmy, this letter came
when I slept.

434
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:27,352
You see this sign?

435
00:45:27,644 --> 00:45:29,980
SERVE NO COLOUR
Only white

436
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:31,773
As for you, Tojo.

437
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:33,734
It Takata.

438
00:45:34,485 --> 00:45:35,235
What?

439
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:37,696
Mistake.

440
00:45:38,113 --> 00:45:40,574
Not Tojo. Only Takata.

441
00:45:41,617 --> 00:45:43,577
I do not think you heard what I said.

442
00:45:50,584 --> 00:45:52,002
We can make them.

443
00:45:55,339 --> 00:45:56,298
Let's go.

444
00:45:57,674 --> 00:46:01,303
But, Sergeant ...
-Zaki, come on.

445
00:46:07,768 --> 00:46:09,561
You were lucky.

446
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:16,652
Lucky,
just as we ...

447
00:46:17,861 --> 00:46:20,864
to fight for freedom
fight their own battles.

448
00:46:21,865 --> 00:46:24,993
Some are worth stoczenia
others do not.

449
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:28,997
Do not worry so.

450
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:34,002
Yes, keep food warm.
- "Aloha Oe."

451
00:46:35,254 --> 00:46:37,548
-What?
-Until we meet again.

452
00:46:47,015 --> 00:46:50,102
One third of our regiment
came from an internment camp ...

453
00:46:50,185 --> 00:46:52,813
Where they were detained
wszyscty the Japanese from the west coast

454
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:57,025
Yuk told me that they lost
houses, jobs ...

455
00:46:58,235 --> 00:46:59,862
everything they had.

456
00:47:00,737 --> 00:47:02,156
The rest of us came from the islands.

457
00:47:03,615 --> 00:47:07,077
No matter where you came from
Hawaii and Mississippi ...

458
00:47:08,078 --> 00:47:09,830
we are all for the same reason ...

459
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:13,834
and together we return home
or we die together.

460
00:47:42,196 --> 00:47:43,363
Hello darling.

461
00:47:44,781 --> 00:47:46,825
Your grandfather is looking for you.

462
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:49,578
Come on, I'll take you to him.

463
00:48:02,925 --> 00:48:04,092
Thank you.

464
00:48:09,973 --> 00:48:11,058
Goodbye.

465
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,238
How are you, Reverend?

466
00:48:24,321 --> 00:48:26,281
Well, Jimmy.
And do you like?

467
00:48:26,824 --> 00:48:28,075
Can I ask you something?

468
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:29,076
Sure.

469
00:48:29,493 --> 00:48:30,869
When someone dies ...

470
00:48:31,954 --> 00:48:34,414
How many days needed
soul to get to heaven?

471
00:48:35,457 --> 00:48:36,959
What kind of Buddhist?

472
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:41,964
49. It lasts 49 days.

473
00:48:44,216 --> 00:48:47,427
Just as I thought.
Thank you, Reverend.

474
00:49:13,203 --> 00:49:16,290
Noszowi brought the dead and wounded
from the first line ...

475
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:19,001
occupy all the beds and stretchers.

476
00:49:20,669 --> 00:49:22,754
Our tanks and trucks
could not reach the scene.

477
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:25,340
Our artillery
could not help us.

478
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:28,844
We learned that
Command was right.

479
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:33,015
Two full regiments, more than
7000 Nazis.

480
00:49:34,057 --> 00:49:36,059
They had more than twice
advantage over us.

481
00:49:36,768 --> 00:49:39,813
Hitler wanted to make
Teksanczyków example.

482
00:49:40,898 --> 00:49:43,525
Too much approached the FATHERLANDU.

483
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:51,158
You were with us a very
long, Takata?

484
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:55,829
10 years.
Time flies.

485
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:08,800
The command of the company.
They think that you ...

486
00:50:09,927 --> 00:50:14,848
Well, I think that all the Japanese
can poison everything.

487
00:50:15,933 --> 00:50:17,643
If you are not exempt.

488
00:50:25,108 --> 00:50:26,360
Sorry, Jimmy.

489
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:36,578
Cease fire!
Cease fire! Cease fire!

490
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:47,214
-Do you think you will repeat the strike?
-I do not know.

491
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:50,968
Give it a rest guys?

492
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:54,054
Not half will go to sleep.
Make sure that everyone got something to drink and eat.

493
00:50:54,054 --> 00:50:54,930
Ok, sir.

494
00:50:54,972 --> 00:50:57,057
Collect ammunition from the dead
and give the money.

495
00:50:58,141 --> 00:50:59,101
Command.

496
00:51:17,995 --> 00:51:20,038
Ends supplies, Lieutenant.

497
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:22,958
Ammunition?

498
00:51:25,752 --> 00:51:28,630
Let us pray that, although
one shot came to us.

499
00:51:32,926 --> 00:51:34,803
What's so funny you, Sergeant?

500
00:51:35,554 --> 00:51:37,139
Well, sir, just a thought ...

501
00:51:38,348 --> 00:51:40,893
You came to the front lines
20 days ago?

502
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:43,145
22 days.

503
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:47,774
The fast track
to take command.

504
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:50,944
When I was in North Africa
18 months ago ...

505
00:51:51,028 --> 00:51:52,863
Was assigned
the Medical Battalions.

506
00:51:53,906 --> 00:51:55,157
It's been so long?

507
00:51:55,824 --> 00:52:00,496
Every day, reported
How many died in battle.

508
00:52:02,706 --> 00:52:09,171
I looked at the body to give
face name.

509
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:13,383
In Italy, I could not do this anymore.

510
00:52:15,052 --> 00:52:18,430
I decided that I want to be part of the living,
and not just dead ...

511
00:52:20,432 --> 00:52:21,808
and so I found myself here.

512
00:52:24,061 --> 00:52:25,646
Are you married, Sergeant?

513
00:52:26,063 --> 00:52:26,980
Yes, sir.

514
00:52:28,232 --> 00:52:32,444
I have 3 beautiful daughters
in San Antonio.

515
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:37,032
Taking care of it
you could still see them.

516
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:38,867
Yes, sir.

517
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:49,503
Sorry.
Sorry!

518
00:52:55,217 --> 00:52:58,387
With a name like Grace,
you're so kind.

519
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:01,974
Do not laugh at me.

520
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:05,143
These are only
two simple steps, right?

521
00:53:05,936 --> 00:53:06,645
I know.

522
00:53:10,023 --> 00:53:12,734
I'm next.
Not broken him all the fingers.

523
00:53:14,194 --> 00:53:16,071
once, twice ...

524
00:53:16,196 --> 00:53:18,699
Well. Way to go.
Finally caught!

525
00:53:19,616 --> 00:53:21,118
So finally I get it!

526
00:53:21,618 --> 00:53:23,579
Yes, Grace, you can get around quite well.

527
00:53:24,913 --> 00:53:27,249
Just because I have a good teacher.

528
00:53:30,127 --> 00:53:31,837
Check the band on his leg!

529
00:53:33,547 --> 00:53:36,300
Do not cut my leg, Doc!
Do not cut my leg!

530
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,218
I need clamps.

531
00:53:40,137 --> 00:53:42,222
Tighten the band!
I have to take care of his breast.

532
00:53:42,222 --> 00:53:43,515
Remove blood, I see nothing.

533
00:53:48,479 --> 00:53:50,564
"God, Jimmy ...
-Hold on Yuk.

534
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:56,528
Jimmy, get bandages.
I think that is the whole artery.

535
00:53:57,446 --> 00:53:58,947
Where is my mother?

536
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:00,699
Corporal, come and help me!

537
00:54:01,033 --> 00:54:02,034
Frances ...

538
00:54:02,284 --> 00:54:03,744
-Lots of debris.
-Gracie ...

539
00:54:13,045 --> 00:54:17,424
This is for you.
I did it.

540
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:27,434
Wow. What is it?

541
00:54:28,268 --> 00:54:30,312
Senninbari.

542
00:54:30,479 --> 00:54:32,189
This is a protective belt.

543
00:54:32,189 --> 00:54:35,776
They did it for the last 6 months
for all our soldiers.

544
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:38,278
Mom took him to all the women in the camp.

545
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:43,158
Each has done a stitch
and provided further until the stitches taken in 1000.

546
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:46,328
Wear it in battle,
around the abdomen.

547
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:48,580
This is for your protection

548
00:54:50,624 --> 00:54:53,544
These are the ghosts of 1000
loving those who are with you.

549
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:06,265
You look like you
went to the funeral.

550
00:55:06,348 --> 00:55:07,683
Do not say that!

551
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:10,477
Just kidding.

552
00:55:12,813 --> 00:55:14,189
Come on.

553
00:55:23,907 --> 00:55:25,367
Through it.

554
00:55:26,827 --> 00:55:29,037
But now really gone.

555
00:55:29,663 --> 00:55:32,374
I have a whole regiment,
who will look after me.

556
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:34,168
Okay?

557
00:55:34,918 --> 00:55:39,381
Promise that you'll wear it.
Please promise.

558
00:55:42,926 --> 00:55:45,387
Return home safely and well?

559
00:56:16,376 --> 00:56:17,711
I promise.

560
00:57:30,325 --> 00:57:31,243
Dad?

561
00:57:34,955 --> 00:57:40,294
Ah, Jimmy.
Nice surprise.

562
00:57:41,378 --> 00:57:43,255
How are you?

563
00:57:45,674 --> 00:57:50,012
What? Worried about me?
Are you afraid it will be?

564
00:57:51,972 --> 00:57:53,098
You do not need.

565
00:57:54,516 --> 00:57:57,769
What can you do for me
Everything has been done already?

566
00:58:00,481 --> 00:58:01,523
You should go.

567
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:10,532
Jimmy, now listen to his father.

568
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:14,536
You must accept your destiny here.

569
00:58:16,997 --> 00:58:20,459
The rest will follow here.

570
00:58:29,218 --> 00:58:30,385
Be strong.

571
00:58:51,824 --> 00:58:54,409
-Time to blackout.
-Right.

572
00:58:59,414 --> 00:59:00,541
It's getting late.

573
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:03,377
I do not want you to go out already.

574
00:59:04,253 --> 00:59:05,420
And your parents?

575
00:59:07,756 --> 00:59:08,841
I thought ...

576
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:16,598
The point is ...
that would spend every day with you.

577
00:59:18,433 --> 00:59:19,434
Me too.

578
00:59:22,604 --> 00:59:26,567
We do not have enough time
or days.

579
00:59:36,451 --> 00:59:38,245
He wants to go blurry.

580
00:59:45,169 --> 00:59:47,004
-We can not.
-What?

581
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:49,590
NANCY ...
-Why?

582
00:59:52,009 --> 00:59:55,888
Nancy, I do not want you to
waiting here ...

583
00:59:57,181 --> 00:59:58,140
to something ...

584
01:00:03,312 --> 01:00:05,647
"I know that you love me.
-Yes.

585
01:00:11,028 --> 01:00:12,279
Yes.

586
01:00:19,203 --> 01:00:20,496
It only counts.

587
01:00:21,663 --> 01:00:22,915
Nancy ...

588
01:00:40,516 --> 01:00:42,476
Stay for a night with me.

589
01:00:50,442 --> 01:00:51,318
Nice dream?

590
01:00:52,736 --> 01:00:55,197
Sergeant?
We get up?

591
01:00:55,989 --> 01:00:56,865
Only me.

592
01:00:58,367 --> 01:00:59,493
I do not understand.

593
01:01:00,202 --> 01:01:04,540
In an hour, say
Suzuki sergeant that I had to leave.

594
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:06,875
Where are you going?

595
01:01:07,668 --> 01:01:09,086
I filed for you.

596
01:01:10,254 --> 01:01:12,339
Rana shoulder will give you a ticket home.

597
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:14,299
You need to provide this ring.

598
01:01:18,595 --> 01:01:20,556
Do not tell the doctor until tomorrow.

599
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:31,233
The world shows what you're small.

600
01:01:32,484 --> 01:01:34,570
War knows the way frogs pick your conscience.

601
01:01:35,612 --> 01:01:38,699
Sometimes, all we are waiting ...

602
01:01:39,449 --> 01:01:43,537
This 3-day rations,
full canteen, clean guns ...

603
01:01:43,954 --> 01:01:45,747
and all the ammunition they can carry.

604
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,250
That taught us.

605
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:50,878
with all of this
Texans went.

606
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:53,338
Time is running out.

607
01:02:13,775 --> 01:02:16,236
-This is the password for today?
-I thought so.

608
01:02:19,156 --> 01:02:20,282
It's just, Sgt.

609
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:22,618
Okay, go.

610
01:02:32,794 --> 01:02:34,880
I thought that you needed help.

611
01:02:34,963 --> 01:02:36,048
And your arm?

612
01:02:37,549 --> 01:02:38,800
Ceased to bleed.

613
01:02:40,844 --> 01:02:41,803
And your leg?

614
01:02:42,679 --> 01:02:43,972
The doctor let me go.

615
01:02:45,682 --> 01:02:47,017
And what's your excuse?

616
01:02:49,603 --> 01:02:51,605
I question the diagnosis?

617
01:02:53,232 --> 01:02:54,733
What are you doing here?

618
01:02:54,983 --> 01:02:57,110
I've always been a member of the company.

619
01:02:58,821 --> 01:03:00,823
Okay.
Watada, on the forehead.

620
01:03:01,615 --> 01:03:02,533
Well, Sarge.

621
01:03:02,616 --> 01:03:03,659
Doctor, for me.

622
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:05,786
Let 's in the column.

623
01:03:23,595 --> 01:03:24,596
What do you have?

624
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:27,141
The position of the machine gun,
90 meters at the 10th hour

625
01:03:27,307 --> 01:03:28,517
So close?

626
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,019
Is directed away from us
in the direction of the hill.

627
01:03:39,528 --> 01:03:42,781
Falcon's Eye, then take with Watada,
left flank.

628
01:03:43,699 --> 01:03:46,034
Minami, fire support.

629
01:03:47,327 --> 01:03:49,705
Shoot and throw grenades
when they are within our reach.

630
01:03:49,705 --> 01:03:53,167
Doctor, I do not want you to be
walking away from here.

631
01:03:53,667 --> 01:03:55,377
Hey what the doctor ...

632
01:03:55,752 --> 01:03:59,256
This gun is able to clean up human
from a distance of 360 meters.

633
01:04:00,924 --> 01:04:02,217
I'll stay here.

634
01:04:08,724 --> 01:04:09,600
Sorry.

635
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:20,903
-Hey, Doc ...
"Yes?"

636
01:04:21,403 --> 01:04:22,613
How is Seattle?

637
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:27,868
Seattle?
I have never been. There are nice?

638
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:30,704
Lots of rain.

639
01:04:31,163 --> 01:04:34,625
But it is green
wherever you look.

640
01:04:35,417 --> 01:04:36,877
Lots of trees?

641
01:04:37,878 --> 01:04:39,379
When the weather is nice ...

642
01:04:39,463 --> 01:04:42,174
view of snowy slopes
Mount Ranier, the blue sky ...

643
01:04:43,884 --> 01:04:45,093
simply breathtaking.

644
01:04:50,098 --> 01:04:50,933
Thank you, doctor.

645
01:04:56,104 --> 01:04:57,356
During the summer ...

646
01:04:58,357 --> 01:05:00,776
watching as the salmon swim
up the river ...

647
01:05:01,485 --> 01:05:05,197
and black bears catching them
in the air ...

648
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:09,868
this must be the most beautiful place on earth.

649
01:05:45,988 --> 01:05:47,948
I think there is more to come.

650
01:05:51,994 --> 01:05:53,745
We only have an hour till dusk.

651
01:05:56,999 --> 01:05:58,709
I think we should relax.

652
01:06:00,294 --> 01:06:01,795
Zabezpieczcie perimeter.

653
01:06:35,078 --> 01:06:36,038
Do you have dreams?

654
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:43,045
Do you have dreams?
You must be dreaming.

655
01:06:45,005 --> 01:06:48,300
You're talking about night dreams
when I sleep?

656
01:06:49,885 --> 01:06:51,011
No, seriously.

657
01:06:54,097 --> 01:06:57,976
Dreaming about us?
About our future?

658
01:07:00,395 --> 01:07:01,522
Future?

659
01:07:05,859 --> 01:07:07,903
Is fulfilled
All your dreams?

660
01:07:10,405 --> 01:07:12,366
I have to think a moment.

661
01:07:14,868 --> 01:07:16,453
Just kidding.

662
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:19,832
I do not.

663
01:07:25,754 --> 01:07:28,215
Which tell you dream?

664
01:07:30,259 --> 01:07:31,385
Choose one.

665
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:34,012
Well ..

666
01:07:35,139 --> 01:07:36,306
Sometimes ...

667
01:07:38,475 --> 01:07:40,018
I dream ...

668
01:07:41,895 --> 01:07:43,105
That we are far away ...

669
01:07:44,982 --> 01:07:46,567
where no one knows ...

670
01:07:48,735 --> 01:07:50,612
and where can we start all over again.

671
01:07:54,992 --> 01:07:56,451
Do you feel lucky?

672
01:07:57,161 --> 01:07:58,537
Sure I am.

673
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:02,082
But sometimes ...

674
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:05,377
I would give you more ...

675
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:09,047
I would like to give you a better life.

676
01:08:13,886 --> 01:08:15,971
Never again do not think so.

677
01:08:17,598 --> 01:08:19,141
I love our life.

678
01:08:24,104 --> 01:08:25,522
Most of the time ...

679
01:08:27,191 --> 01:08:29,067
I dream of you.

680
01:08:30,986 --> 01:08:32,154
Do not you see that?

681
01:08:36,492 --> 01:08:39,578
You're all my life!

682
01:09:14,363 --> 01:09:15,113
Doc?

683
01:09:16,406 --> 01:09:17,991
Excuse me, Doc,
asleep?

684
01:09:18,867 --> 01:09:19,618
No.

685
01:09:20,577 --> 01:09:22,162
I ask you some questions?

686
01:09:22,704 --> 01:09:27,084
It looks like Sgt Tact
and you're friends, right?

687
01:09:27,543 --> 01:09:29,044
I think so.

688
01:09:30,045 --> 01:09:32,339
He served in Battalion 100.

689
01:09:32,589 --> 01:09:35,133
Yes. He and
is a pair of attic timers.

690
01:09:35,926 --> 01:09:38,929
Before the war he served several
Hawaii branch of Territorial Defence.

691
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:43,600
I 100 Battalion suffered
heavy losses in Italy.

692
01:09:44,476 --> 01:09:45,435
Some 900th

693
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:51,859
These boys from Hawaii
lost 900 of 1432 people.

694
01:09:55,779 --> 01:09:57,239
Why is it moved?

695
01:09:57,281 --> 01:10:00,284
Watada and I think that
100 battalion has more experience ...

696
01:10:00,284 --> 01:10:03,620
and it takes experienced NCOs
Regiment will be more efficient.

697
01:10:08,417 --> 01:10:09,251
Or not.

698
01:10:10,085 --> 01:10:11,253
You talk too much.

699
01:10:11,962 --> 01:10:13,672
Sorry.
I was a journalist.

700
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:17,718
Younger brother Jimmy served
in this company.

701
01:10:18,302 --> 01:10:22,598
NCO has done him a favor.
He wanted to keep an eye on his brother, but ...

702
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,602
He died in the first battle.

703
01:10:31,148 --> 01:10:32,441
Thank you, Doc.

704
01:10:44,286 --> 01:10:45,245
You're new, right?

705
01:10:47,164 --> 01:10:49,124
Complement.
I'm here for two weeks.

706
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:50,959
Where are you from?

707
01:10:51,335 --> 01:10:53,128
Camp Butte, Gila River,
Arizona.

708
01:10:55,589 --> 01:10:58,884
You mean before? I'm from Stockton.
This is in California.

709
01:11:01,345 --> 01:11:04,139
Practically the whole city
sent to the camp.

710
01:11:07,309 --> 01:11:09,561
Some good news, sir?

711
01:11:13,273 --> 01:11:14,608
My father died.

712
01:11:16,068 --> 01:11:17,319
This is from my wife.

713
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:20,155
It took almost 2 months
it arrived here.

714
01:11:22,032 --> 01:11:24,618
He was in federal prison
on Terminal Island.

715
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:25,661
Prison?

716
01:11:26,328 --> 01:11:28,497
The FBI arrested him
after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

717
01:11:29,957 --> 01:11:30,958
Why?

718
01:11:32,668 --> 01:11:34,795
They thought he was a spy.

719
01:11:35,838 --> 01:11:37,297
I've heard of such cases.

720
01:11:37,339 --> 01:11:39,842
The FBI arrested the men
throughout the West Coast.

721
01:11:39,883 --> 01:11:43,929
But this is the first case when it comes to Hawaii
. What has been accused?

722
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:48,267
He was a Buddhist priest.

723
01:11:51,228 --> 01:11:53,188
Today 49 days have passed
since he is dead.

724
01:11:58,318 --> 01:12:00,737
I know I should not
record of such things ...

725
01:12:00,821 --> 01:12:03,240
but if you have recorded
I will not remember.

726
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:05,117
Old habit.

727
01:12:08,245 --> 01:12:09,997
Can I ask another question?

728
01:12:10,831 --> 01:12:15,127
-Many say.
-Often I hear it.

729
01:12:18,714 --> 01:12:20,757
Did you ever scared?

730
01:12:24,386 --> 01:12:25,679
Every day.

731
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:27,389
But not death.

732
01:12:28,682 --> 01:12:30,559
I'm afraid to lose
more people.

733
01:12:34,396 --> 01:12:36,690
You were close
Nakajo to Sergeant?

734
01:12:41,195 --> 01:12:42,196
Christmas, Jimmy.

735
01:12:44,698 --> 01:12:47,993
I felt as if someone
I cut off one of his hands.

736
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:58,921
Tomorrow will be a tough day.
Go better rest.

737
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:03,550
I can not sleep.
Insomnia.

738
01:13:11,475 --> 01:13:14,561
100 battalion of heavy fighting takes place.
The second can not move forward.

739
01:13:16,104 --> 01:13:17,773
They will have to dig deeper and the bear.

740
01:13:18,273 --> 01:13:20,192
Germany resist along this road.

741
01:13:20,484 --> 01:13:22,402
We are 500m from the top of the hill.

742
01:13:22,986 --> 01:13:23,821
Which hill?

743
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:29,576
We have to wait until tomorrow.

744
01:13:31,286 --> 01:13:32,788
General wants a frontal attack.

745
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,290
Sergeant, look who we found.

746
01:13:38,293 --> 01:13:39,378
PORSCHE, Please ...

747
01:13:39,795 --> 01:13:40,796
Hi, rascal.

748
01:13:49,471 --> 01:13:50,806
Sergeant King!

749
01:13:53,934 --> 01:13:56,353
"Sir!
-Break our left flank!

750
01:13:56,353 --> 01:13:58,147
Take the machine gun
and strengthen the left flank!

751
01:13:58,188 --> 01:13:58,981
Yes it is.

752
01:14:05,154 --> 01:14:08,282
Ahead of us a strong grouping of the enemy.
We can not rub! Reception.

753
01:14:08,657 --> 01:14:11,285
You can not stop!
You have to rub!

754
01:14:12,536 --> 01:14:16,665
Repeat. Do not stop.
Forward. The end of the reception.

755
01:14:19,501 --> 01:14:22,504
Jimmy, take your platoon
and protects the left flank.

756
01:14:22,796 --> 01:14:25,883
The second platoon will send the right.
I'll take the middle third and fourth

757
01:14:26,341 --> 01:14:30,012
We have orders to attack.
We need to break these lines.

758
01:14:38,937 --> 01:14:39,771
Frontal assault.

759
01:14:41,064 --> 01:14:41,940
Frontal assault!

760
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:51,033
Forward!

761
01:14:56,497 --> 01:14:57,456
Forward!

762
01:15:43,085 --> 01:15:45,838
Cease fire! Cease fire!

763
01:15:46,338 --> 01:15:48,757
Cease fire! Cease fire!

764
01:16:12,573 --> 01:16:13,448
Medic!

765
01:17:01,997 --> 01:17:02,831
Grenade!

766
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:14,736
Fall back! retreat!

767
01:18:34,798 --> 01:18:37,384
Come on! ride with them!

768
01:18:59,656 --> 01:19:00,741
Sergeant King.

769
01:19:39,822 --> 01:19:44,660
Miss Nisei 1939 Takase Eli!

770
01:19:50,874 --> 01:19:52,417
Eli, what are you doing?

771
01:19:53,126 --> 01:19:54,086
I can not believe it!

772
01:19:54,503 --> 01:19:55,879
I knew that you win.

773
01:19:55,879 --> 01:19:58,090
Really?
"You're the prettiest of them all.

774
01:19:58,173 --> 01:19:59,299
You're the best.

775
01:20:00,717 --> 01:20:03,011
Do not cry.
You still need to take some pictures.

776
01:20:06,181 --> 01:20:06,974
I love you.

777
01:20:07,391 --> 01:20:09,351
Go.
The audience wants you.

778
01:20:42,384 --> 01:20:44,261
Wahiawa ...

779
01:20:48,724 --> 01:20:50,726
No. You do not need.

780
01:20:55,689 --> 01:20:56,648
Przebilismy up?

781
01:21:08,952 --> 01:21:11,163
Do not let bury me here.

782
01:21:11,955 --> 01:21:13,749
Too many ghosts.

783
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:29,264
Send my ashes
Eli, right?

784
01:21:48,659 --> 01:21:49,451
Perimeter.

785
01:21:49,993 --> 01:21:51,119
Protected.

786
01:21:54,122 --> 01:21:56,166
We need to get ready for ...

787
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:58,961
Counterattack. I know.

788
01:22:13,142 --> 01:22:13,976
Richard?

789
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:17,563
Dad, is it really you?

790
01:22:17,938 --> 01:22:21,483
Ah, Richard! Richard!

791
01:23:04,818 --> 01:23:05,944
Sergeant Takata?

792
01:23:06,403 --> 01:23:07,029
Sir.

793
01:23:07,446 --> 01:23:09,323
Lt. Terry, 141 Battalion.

794
01:23:12,075 --> 01:23:13,952
You rescued my people.

795
01:23:18,415 --> 01:23:19,958
I would like to thank you.

796
01:23:32,262 --> 01:23:33,847
Do you have done the same for us.

797
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:38,310
Without hesitation.

798
01:23:56,119 --> 01:23:58,914
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil

799
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:02,084
Ba thine is the kingdom, the power and
glory, forever. Amen.

800
01:24:08,132 --> 01:24:11,260
211 rescued
guys ...

801
01:24:12,094 --> 01:24:13,929
with the 275th battalion numbering

802
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:20,561
100 and 442 battalion suffered
loss of 800 soldiers.

803
01:24:22,104 --> 01:24:27,109
The generals seem to orders,
soldiers must be done.

804
01:24:28,152 --> 01:24:29,403
Somewhere between ...

805
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:32,906
the rest of us still hope.

806
01:24:48,630 --> 01:24:49,715
God Almighty.

807
01:25:23,499 --> 01:25:24,583
Who is it?

808
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:27,461
Lt. Teksanczyków.

809
01:25:30,839 --> 01:25:32,090
Tough guy, huh?

810
01:25:41,517 --> 01:25:42,851
What do you think?

811
01:25:46,563 --> 01:25:48,357
I'm glad we did.

812
01:26:14,508 --> 01:26:15,551
Jimmy ...

813
01:26:20,013 --> 01:26:21,640
tell me what to do.

814
01:26:33,235 --> 01:26:35,404
Return to me, Jimmy!

815
01:28:00,572 --> 01:28:01,490
Dad.

816
01:28:26,723 --> 01:28:28,350
Accept your fate.

817
01:28:30,561 --> 01:28:32,354
The rest will follow you.

818
01:28:38,694 --> 01:28:41,280
Freddie wrote to
me every week.

819
01:28:44,533 --> 01:28:47,369
He tried to see me
before leaving ...

820
01:28:49,163 --> 01:28:51,290
but for some reason,
never failed.

821
01:28:54,126 --> 01:28:55,169
I always thought ...

822
01:28:56,545 --> 01:28:59,631
that he does not want to see me.

823
01:29:01,008 --> 01:29:01,884
I think ...

824
01:29:03,218 --> 01:29:07,639
He was afraid that I will
just sit and wait for him.

825
01:29:15,189 --> 01:29:17,441
He asked me to marry him
before he left.

826
01:29:17,441 --> 01:29:19,234
He told you that?

827
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:28,911
It was my favorite
time of day.

828
01:29:31,622 --> 01:29:33,999
I went to the seaside, wherever he was ...

829
01:29:36,251 --> 01:29:38,128
in order to see the sunset.

830
01:29:42,466 --> 01:29:44,551
I imagined that sits next to me ...

831
01:29:46,887 --> 01:29:52,434
On the other side of the world
the sun rose for him.

832
01:29:59,107 --> 01:30:03,570
Joni, this is James Takata.
He is a friend of your father.

833
01:30:07,783 --> 01:30:08,450
Hi

834
01:30:28,428 --> 01:30:29,930
You can go have fun.

835
01:30:35,936 --> 01:30:39,314
... I brought you something.

836
01:30:52,536 --> 01:30:54,746
He wanted to give it to you when you return home.

837
01:30:56,331 --> 01:30:57,332
Freddie ...

838
01:30:58,876 --> 01:31:00,419
gave his life for me.

839
01:31:09,178 --> 01:31:12,181
The last thing I could do
to bring this ring.

840
01:31:19,730 --> 01:31:21,023
Thank you.

841
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:40,000
Everything will be fine.

842
01:31:58,852 --> 01:31:59,812
Whose good?

843
01:32:04,399 --> 01:32:05,067
Yes.

844
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:16,078
My father told me that the Buddhist
considering the whole life ...

845
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:18,580
about how everything that lives is precious.

846
01:32:20,290 --> 01:32:22,709
He also told me
that if you choose to fight ...

847
01:32:23,418 --> 01:32:24,419
accept this decision ...

848
01:32:25,379 --> 01:32:28,173
otherwise you look
the world with compassion.

849
01:32:28,882 --> 01:32:31,426
In Hawaii, we also found that ...

850
01:32:32,553 --> 01:32:34,346
Whatever you do in life ...

851
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:37,516
Do it for the next seven generations.

852
01:33:12,676 --> 01:33:28,901
ONLY THE BRAVE
