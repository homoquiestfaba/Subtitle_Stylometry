1
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,646
How many more do you figure, Captain?

2
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:46,274
A dozen probably, maybe more.

3
00:01:56,785 --> 00:01:59,329
I think air support's getting
a little too close to us, sir.

4
00:01:59,496 --> 00:02:01,414
Is the radio still working?

5
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:02,999
No, sir.
This one's full of sand.

6
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,627
The only radio left
is in the other vehicle, sir.

7
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:07,128
Cover me, Corporal.

8
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:08,963
Yes, sir.

9
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:22,310
Ghost Rider 5, this is Warrior 6.
Come in. Over.

10
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:24,562
This is Ghost Rider 5.
Go ahead. Over.

11
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:27,524
We appreciate the support, Lieutenant,
but I need you to back off that truck.

12
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,317
Otherwise General Thoren
is gonna rip us both a new one.

13
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:31,486
Roger that, sir.

14
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:55,218
Schwalb! C'mon, buddy. Schwalb?

15
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,013
Medic! Medic!

16
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:10,108
Anything I can do, sir?

17
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,142
Ghost Rider 5, this is Warrior 6.
Come in. Over.

18
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:27,352
Go ahead, Warrior 6.

19
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,729
The enemy has stopped firing.
We're gonna move in and check it out.

20
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:31,272
I just need you to stay close.
Copy?

21
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,483
I've got your back, sir.
Over.

22
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,277
All right, Collins, tell the men
we're gonna move out.

23
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:38,029
We're gonna head over there
and see what the hell happened.

24
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:39,364
- Rock 'n' roll, sir.
- All right, Collins,

25
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,115
tell the guys not to get cocky.
I don't want any more casualties.

26
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:43,326
<i>- Copy?
- Copy that.</i>

27
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,436
Anything, sir?

28
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:13,147
No, it's like they packed up their tents
and moved out.

29
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:15,316
What about all that screaming?

30
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,110
You got me, Private.

31
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,237
Do you think it's a trap, sir?

32
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:22,657
I don't know. Let's move in
and check it out. Stay low.

33
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:35,837
Inventory sheets indicate
two crates missing, sir.

34
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:38,089
They're over by the rocks.
Have the guys collect the weapons.

35
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:41,009
- I'll be there in a minute.
- Copy that, sir.

36
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:44,178
<i>- How bad is it?
- A clean exit. You'll live.</i>

37
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:46,681
But it looks like you just
bought yourself a trip back home.

38
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:48,558
Wonderful.

39
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:51,060
What do you think
happened there, Captain?

40
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:53,855
I have no idea. They leave
the weapons truck out in plain view.

41
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:55,648
One minute they ambush us,
the next...

42
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:58,026
Any idea why they left?

43
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,695
I have no clue.
I'm just happy they're gone.

44
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:02,321
Thanks for the Band-Aid.

45
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:03,865
My pleasure.

46
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:06,200
If you don't mind,
I'm going to take a closer look.

47
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,786
Be my guest.

48
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:22,800
Beshbesh...

49
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:26,387
a very large,
very dangerous spider.

50
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:27,805
A spider did this?

51
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:30,558
I've seen plenty of spiders out here,
but none of them could do that.

52
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:32,894
Then you have never seen
a beshbesh.

53
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:34,896
They're extremely deadly

54
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:38,024
and can reproduce
in a matter of days.

55
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:41,235
My people call them
"devils of the sand".

56
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:43,529
Well, whatever
you call 'em,

57
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:46,574
they were angels
for us today.

58
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:52,038
Just get that Humvee
as close as you can, okay?

59
00:06:52,205 --> 00:06:54,082
Yes, sir.

60
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,583
How's it coming, Collins?

61
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,418
Good. Only two rebels
unaccounted for, sir.

62
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:59,087
Well, they might be
up above these rocks.

63
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,922
Why don't you sweep the area?
Take Daniels with you.

64
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:06,511
What the hell was that?

65
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,554
It could be a sand devil.

66
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:10,098
What the hell is
a sand devil, sir?

67
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,433
Unless you want to find out the hard
way, forget sweeping the rocks.

68
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,185
Let's just get these rifles
in the truck.

69
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:16,896
All right, gentlemen, pack it in.
Pack it up. We're moving out.

70
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:18,106
Yes, sir.

71
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,608
You heard the captain.
Move it out.

72
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:25,113
<i>- Captain.
- What is it?</i>

73
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,699
It's Corporal Schwalb, sir.
He didn't make it.

74
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:31,452
Damn it.

75
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:33,746
Send it up, sir?

76
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:37,458
No, pack up his gear. Box him up.
I'll take him home with me.

77
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,001
Yes, sir.

78
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:47,528
You got something to say,
Sergeant?

79
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:49,405
No, sir.

80
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:51,532
All right, just tell me what's
on your mind. It's an order.

81
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:53,534
Permission to speak
freely, sir.

82
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:55,620
Granted. Now spill it.

83
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:58,039
It's just that we've been driving
since 0700

84
00:08:58,206 --> 00:09:00,708
and that's only the third time
you've spoken to me.

85
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,752
You've been keeping track?

86
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,837
It helps me
to stay awake, sir.

87
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:08,132
It's either that or my smokes,
and I quit those a month ago.

88
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:11,177
A smart decision, Sergeant.
Those things will kill you.

89
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:15,056
But I imagine it's better
than a bullet to the head.

90
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:17,058
Were you and
Corporal Schwalb close?

91
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:21,437
Close enough that this isn't
just a responsibility.

92
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:23,397
It's a duty.

93
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,068
I'm sorry for your loss, sir.

94
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:30,488
Thanks. It's not the first time
and I'm sure it won't be the last.

95
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:32,156
Schwalb was a good soldier.

96
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:34,492
They're all good soldiers.

97
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:38,621
I appreciate you letting me
piggyback on your ride here.

98
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:40,915
It's not a big deal.
Not much back there

99
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:43,834
but some M-16$ for the new recruits
coming in from Selby next week.

100
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,921
<i>- Fresh meat.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

101
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,110
Yeah, Jimmy Ray,
I got an eye on him.

102
00:10:09,277 --> 00:10:13,030
Roger that, Sheriff.
Can you pinpoint the location?

103
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:16,325
They're headed east on 181,
gotta be doing 90 mph.

104
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,203
Copy that.

105
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:29,547
Go ahead and call up Mac
over at Cedarsburg

106
00:10:29,714 --> 00:10:31,841
and see if he can't set up a spike strip
or something for us.

107
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:37,722
I imagine we both could use a little bit
of coffee about now.

108
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:39,432
How far did you say
that rest stop was?

109
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,017
Just around the bend.

110
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:42,727
<i>Watch out!</i>

111
00:10:46,022 --> 00:10:47,690
Oh, that ain't good.

112
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:10,755
- Jimmy Ray.
- Go.

113
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,049
We've got a little accident
out here on 181

114
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:15,009
just past
the marker number 12.

115
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:16,719
We're gonna need
some emergency vehicles.

116
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:18,721
Copy that, Sheriff.

117
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:20,681
Just call Abe
out at the garage

118
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,725
and have him send out
a tow truck, okay?

119
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:25,061
And like I said,
gonna need a meat wagon.

120
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,896
Coming to you.

121
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:30,941
Are you okay?

122
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,693
Yeah, I think so.

123
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:37,114
We're gonna have to put you in
for the Purple Heart.

124
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:38,282
Thanks.

125
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,917
Y'all all right?

126
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:49,210
Yeah, I think so.

127
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:52,004
I've got a medic coming.

128
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:55,091
Hell, it looks like you lost
some of your load.

129
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:58,219
I hope it wasn't top secret.

130
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:00,388
I gotta help this one.

131
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,391
Sheriff, Captain Mike Sturges.
I'm gonna have to ask you

132
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,518
to lock down the road till I can
pack up and get out of here.

133
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,854
I'm sorry, Captain. Nobody's
getting out of here anytime soon.

134
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:10,398
Why's that?

135
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,735
Well, I'm no mechanic,
but she looks like

136
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,737
she could use a little work
before she's ready to roll.

137
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,989
I could offer you a ride
back to Cedar Creek

138
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,825
if you want a hotel for tonight
or something.

139
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:23,077
I appreciate it, Sheriff,
but we have to stay with the truck.

140
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:24,912
Well, all right, then.

141
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,747
Go ahead and see
if she'll operate.

142
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:28,874
If she works,
I'll escort you myself.

143
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,918
<i>- All right, thanks.
- Thank you, Sheriff.</i>

144
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:33,003
All right, Sergeant,
see if you can start her up.

145
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,547
Yes, sir.

146
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:00,281
<i>- This is it. What did I say?
- It's gorgeous.</i>

147
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:03,784
<i>- Beautiful, bro. It's awesome.
- Whoo! Let's party.</i>

148
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:07,872
Yo, Erin, get the stuff in the back,
all right, babe?

149
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:11,208
<i>- Nice move, man.
- Whatever.</i>

150
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,615
Hey, you got the bottle?

151
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,867
Oh, yeah. Good call.

152
00:13:47,912 --> 00:13:49,663
Hey, sharing is caring.
Come on.

153
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,332
There you go.
There you go.

154
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:54,001
Hey, I thought we came out here
to go hiking, not drinking.

155
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,336
Yell at him, not me.

156
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:57,630
Come on, Erin,
stop being such a stiff.

157
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,882
You know what?
I know where this is going.

158
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:01,884
I'm out of here.

159
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:04,678
Hey, what's up?
Where are you going?

160
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,805
Back to the car
so you can take me home.

161
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:08,849
But we just got here.

162
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,768
Then I'll drive myself.

163
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:13,270
<i>- Where did you get those?
- Oh, don't you remember?</i>

164
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:16,690
"Don't forget to lock up when you get
the stuff out of the back, babe".

165
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,692
How am I supposed to
get home?

166
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,778
Try hitching a ride
with your drinking buddy.

167
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:23,030
Are you serious right now?

168
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,534
Bitch.

169
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:40,256
You always leave
the sunroof open.

170
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,633
What if it rains, you dope?

171
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,487
He's just making a scene
for Erin.

172
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,615
Ignore him, baby.

173
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,783
See?

174
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,040
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

175
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:59,627
It's just rocks falling.
Rocks fall all the time around here.

176
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:02,129
No, it's Trent.
He's watching us.

177
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:04,298
Ignore him.

178
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:14,850
Trent, knock it off.
Just 'cause you're not getting any

179
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:17,478
doesn't mean you have to ruin
our good time.

180
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:21,106
Trent, this is so not cool.

181
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:23,984
I can't do this.
You gotta go stop him.

182
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,492
Thanks a lot, jerk.

183
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,336
Get out of here!

184
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,002
That's about the size of it, sir.

185
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:26,338
All right, all right,
I'll get a team from the motor pool

186
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:28,549
out to you
by 0600 tomorrow.

187
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:30,884
<i>- Thank you, sir.
- Just keep an eye on that cargo.</i>

188
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:34,138
The last thing we need is some local
yokels getting one of those weapons.

189
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,724
Yes, sir.

190
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,892
Well, he's bringing a new crew
out here at sunup.

191
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,477
Orders are to stay
with the truck.

192
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:42,980
Wonderful. So I guess
I'm camping out tonight?

193
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:45,566
Yeah, I'll see if I can get us
a couple of rooms, split duty with you.

194
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,651
No use you having all the fun
all by yourself.

195
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:49,403
Fun.

196
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,238
Do you think they got
any room service?

197
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:53,490
I doubt it.

198
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:55,993
I'll check with the sheriff,
see if I can get us some chow.

199
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,413
Oh, man, I'm starving. I could go
for a burger and a milkshake, please.

200
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,081
I'll see what I can do.

201
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,083
Appreciate it.

202
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,836
Hey, I just talked to Jed.
He says y'all can park here if you want.

203
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:08,881
He's even got a couple of rooms
for you free of charge if you need 'em.

204
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,258
Thanks, Sheriff. You know where
we might be able to get some chow?

205
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,218
Oh, heck, yeah.
Come on.

206
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:41,622
Freddy.

207
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:44,208
Freddy, I need a fill-up.

208
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:48,337
Freddy.

209
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,634
anybody?

210
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,430
Freddy.

211
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:03,519
Hello.

212
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:21,078
<i>Help.</i>

213
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:22,663
Help us.

214
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:28,043
Help. Help us.

215
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:37,010
Now stay together, everybody.
This isn't a nature hike.

216
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,346
We've got specimens
to examine.

217
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:46,645
Yeah, but what you have to remember
is that all bugs aren't created equal.

218
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:49,356
Which of course presupposes
my original thesis.

219
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:52,484
Will you two give it a rest, please?
You sound like two old ladies

220
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:55,195
trapped in the bodies
of 20-year-old mega nerds.

221
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,573
And by mega nerds you mean
future Nobel Prize winners?

222
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:58,782
<i>- Oh!
- No.</i>

223
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:02,661
Everyone, gather round.
Now this is what we came to see.

224
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:05,956
Monotypic therasaphid,
genus latrodectus,

225
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:08,500
obviously at least
4,000 years old.

226
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:11,461
Now as you can see from
the fossilized impressions on the rock,

227
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:14,089
this bug had
quite an appetite.

228
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:16,258
This is something
you don't see often,

229
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:18,385
because most of the fauna
from this region

230
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:21,013
cannot thrive in the post-arctic
conditions.

231
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,557
Can we get extra extra credit

232
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,767
if we classify the fossil
by genus and species?

233
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:28,270
Certainly. Be my guest.

234
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:42,159
Remarkable.

235
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:44,494
Students,

236
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,246
look at that.

237
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,002
Oh, my God, what is that?

238
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:55,297
<i>- Looks like a spider.
- Count the appendages, Mr. Wilson.</i>

239
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:01,053
<i>- It only has six.
- This is astonishing,</i>

240
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:04,598
and especially this far removed
from its natural habitat.

241
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:14,816
Professor, be careful.

242
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,459
Oh, my God.

243
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:35,796
<i>- We've got to help him.
- No, we've got to help ourselves.</i>

244
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:37,339
Come on.

245
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:46,139
Where's the rest of them?

246
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,183
I don't care. We just have to
get away from that thing.

247
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:55,983
Eddie!

248
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:58,902
Eddie.

249
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:02,531
No!

250
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:08,161
So what are you doing stuck out here
in the middle of nowhere?

251
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:11,331
Well, if they keep electing me sheriff,
I'll keep showing up for work,

252
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:13,709
except I don't expect it
to last much longer.

253
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,669
That's too bad.
Seems like a nice place.

254
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:19,089
Well, it used to be.
It's practically a ghost town now.

255
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:22,509
Thank God for Reba
and that dang pie of hers, boy.

256
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,219
I suppose that's where
we're headed now, I take it?

257
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:25,887
That's it right there.

258
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:48,160
Romeo and Juliet on the rocks,
over easy.

259
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:50,704
- Coming right up.
- All right.

260
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:53,874
Hey, woman.

261
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:57,044
Howdy, Ken. Hey.

262
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,379
<i>- And who's this fine gentleman?
- Captain Mike Sturges.</i>

263
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:01,423
Airborne. Nice.

264
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,760
Hey, Joe, get out here.
We've got a VIP in the dining room.

265
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:05,969
All right, be right there.

266
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:09,264
<i>- Right this way, gentlemen.
- VIP.</i>

267
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:11,391
Bart, will you get your ass up?

268
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:14,561
How many times have I told you
booths are for two or more customers?

269
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,063
Gentlemen.

270
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:21,151
It's good to be sheriff.

271
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:22,861
We've got some great
specials today.

272
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:24,654
Would you like to start
with a drink?

273
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:27,282
Captain Sturges,
this is my husband Joe.

274
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:29,076
It's a real honor to have you here,
Captain.

275
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:30,827
Thank you for your service
to our country.

276
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,370
<i>- Pleasure.
- Can I start you off</i>

277
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:33,914
with an ice tea, coffee?

278
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:36,792
Hi. Can I get you boys
something to drink?

279
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,503
I guess Patty will take it
from here.

280
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:42,255
Hi, Sheriff, Officer.

281
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:44,091
Ma'am.

282
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:46,593
Can I get you started
with something?

283
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:51,431
I think I'll just
get a burger.

284
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,183
I'm not even hungry any more.

285
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,102
Do you want anything,
sweetheart?

286
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:58,105
<i>- A grilled cheese, I guess.
- You want fries with that, sweetie?</i>

287
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,190
How about
a fruit salad instead?

288
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:02,692
Whatever. Can I have a dollar
to go play a video game?

289
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:06,780
Yeah, yeah. Here, take $5.

290
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:08,949
Thanks.

291
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:14,412
I am so sick of you.

292
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:17,124
It's too bad you lost
your appetite.

293
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,626
I hear the huckleberry pie
is out of this world.

294
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:22,462
Do you even care
that you've ruined everything?

295
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:24,297
Of course I care.

296
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:27,134
But I've already apologized to you
more times than I can count

297
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,136
and we're still headed
for Splitsville in Vegas,

298
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:30,929
so I don't know what more
you want me to do.

299
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:33,598
Dropping dead would be
a good start.

300
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:35,892
So here's where
the new freeway will go.

301
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:39,312
And then we'll build the Indian casino
right over the old gypsum plant.

302
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:42,607
But first we've got to get rid
of these parcels, including this dump.

303
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:45,694
The sooner, the better.
Look, I don't want to show up

304
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:47,821
at the next shareholders' meeting
with more bad news.

305
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:51,992
Just relax. It'll all be taken care of
by the end of the week.

306
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,620
Romeo and Juliet!
All right.

307
00:24:57,998 --> 00:25:00,667
Makes me sick how these rednecks
fall over anything in uniform.

308
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:03,170
What'd you expect?
They're stupid.

309
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,255
Stupid people are easily led.

310
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:07,757
Let's finish up
and get the hell out of here.

311
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:10,343
These hillbillies are starting
to make me depressed,

312
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,180
not to mention GI Joe
and Barbie over there.

313
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:15,515
So that's it.

314
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:18,393
<i>- Is it safe to drink?
- If I was gonna kill you, sweetie,</i>

315
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,353
I wouldn't do it in my own
damn restaurant.

316
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,189
It's bad for business.

317
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:24,983
Oh, and by the way,
the answer is still no.

318
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,694
Do you think we need
to increase the offer?

319
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:30,363
She'll crack.
You'll see.

320
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:38,413
Look.

321
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:42,209
<i>- Let's go.
- Come on.</i>

322
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:54,179
<i>- I don't think anybody's home.
- Break in, then.</i>

323
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:58,266
Traci, Carl,
come on, over here.

324
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:01,311
Come here. Come here.

325
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,981
Come on.

326
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:07,776
<i>- Where's Eddie?
- He didn't make it.</i>

327
00:26:07,943 --> 00:26:10,904
Come on.
They're coming.

328
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:13,198
I got it. Come on.
Come on, come on.

329
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:20,830
Damn.
Anybody getting service?

330
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,165
Nothing.

331
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:23,959
What do we do now?

332
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:26,586
First let's figure out
what the hell we're up against.

333
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:28,964
Well, I got a picture of the one
when we were running.

334
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:34,928
That is one hell
of a nasty spider.

335
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:37,347
What are you doing?

336
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:39,182
This phone has
an encyclopedia.

337
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:41,768
I'm searching for
one hell of a nasty spider.

338
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:45,272
<i>- Damn.
- What's it say?</i>

339
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:48,775
Guys, it looks like we're facing what
seems to be a horde of camel spiders.

340
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:50,652
<i>- What?
- Yeah.</i>

341
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:53,613
It says they're indigenous
to the deserts in the Middle East.

342
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,323
What the hell are they doing
here in Arizona?

343
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,367
<i>- I don't know.
- Does it say how to kill them?</i>

344
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:59,619
No, it just says
that their bite

345
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:01,788
is extremely venomous
and almost always fatal.

346
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:03,832
Damn, we're all gonna die.

347
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:05,959
We are not gonna die, okay?

348
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,628
What we're gonna do is we're gonna
secure the doors and the windows

349
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:11,881
and then we're gonna lay low.
Maybe they'll just go away.

350
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:14,634
<i>- Yeah, and what if they don't?
- You can't think like that, Traci.</i>

351
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,053
I suggest we look around the place
for some kind of weapons.

352
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,139
<i>- Good idea.
- I agree.</i>

353
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:23,560
Stay together.
Traci, you're with me.

354
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:28,523
Hey, time for another
trash run.

355
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,151
- I got it. I got it.
- Thanks, Tommy.

356
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:34,321
Don't take all day.

357
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:05,393
What was that?

358
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:14,569
Look.

359
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:19,324
Let's get out of here.

360
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:31,878
Close that door now.

361
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:33,755
<i>Where's my food?</i>

362
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:35,507
Sergeant, I need that truck
at the diner right away,

363
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:37,258
<i>- a quarter mile up on the right.
- What's going on?</i>

364
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:40,929
You got two words:
big spiders.

365
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:42,597
Don't worry.
Help's on the way.

366
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,240
<i>- What happened?
- Tommy's dead. Go.</i>

367
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:02,075
- What?
- Go, go, go

368
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:07,122
Everybody just stay calm.

369
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:09,416
How are we supposed to do that?
Those things are everywhere.

370
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:11,418
Shut up, stupid.
Did you hear what the man just said?

371
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,920
All right, listen up. I'm gonna have
a truck here in about three minutes.

372
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:16,297
We're gonna hop on it
and get the heck out of here, all right?

373
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:18,258
Mom, where are we going?

374
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:20,802
You just stay with me and your father,
okay? We're gonna be all right.

375
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:24,305
The captain and the sheriff are gonna
take care of everything. Right?

376
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:26,433
Right.

377
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,935
All right, the truck
should be here in a minute.

378
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:31,438
I want you all to grab your belongings
and be ready to go.

379
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:35,150
Mom, look.

380
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:48,371
Out, out, out, out.

381
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:51,166
Move, move.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

382
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:53,710
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, come on.

383
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:55,462
Come on, come on, come on.

384
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:00,925
Let's go. Let's go.

385
00:30:09,267 --> 00:30:11,144
Come on, get in.
Come on, get in the truck.

386
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:14,481
<i>- Honey, honey, come on.
' Ups ups up'</i>

387
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:19,486
Brent!

388
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:25,158
<i>- We gotta help him.
- Get in the truck, damn it.</i>

389
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:28,328
Get out of here. Go.

390
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,665
Go.

391
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:36,336
<i>- Go, go, go, go.
- Yes, sir.</i>

392
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:38,505
Come on, go!

393
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:03,363
Ashley, what about this?

394
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:07,242
Sure. It's got a one-time use,
but okay.

395
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:12,956
You know, I can't get
that picture of Eddie out of my mind.

396
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:14,624
It was horrible.

397
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:17,585
And I just keep on thinking
the same thing's gonna happen to us.

398
00:31:17,752 --> 00:31:19,712
We're gonna be just fine,
Traci, okay?

399
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:21,881
Let's just focus on staying alive
until help arrives.

400
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:24,342
No one even knows
that we're here.

401
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:25,969
When we don't go back
to the school tonight,

402
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:28,388
they'll send someone
to find us.

403
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:31,349
Are you sure?

404
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:35,103
Very sure.

405
00:31:37,355 --> 00:31:39,857
Don't worry,
I've got some ideas.

406
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:42,569
Crap.

407
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:52,954
This gives me a warm,
fuzzy feeling.

408
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,839
<i>- The basement.
- Well, let's go down it.</i>

409
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:04,757
It's dark.

410
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:06,843
So? We found some light.
Let's use it.

411
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,886
How about we don't say we did?
Come on.

412
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:10,972
What if that's how
they can get in?

413
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:13,266
I hate to tell you, but if these things
are already in the house,

414
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:14,934
we're dead meat anyway.

415
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:18,771
All right, look, you stay here.
I'll be right back.

416
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:20,398
But that's not a good idea.

417
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:22,442
Just wait right here, okay?

418
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:24,611
I'll be right back.

419
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:47,842
Buddy, are you okay?

420
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:50,303
So far so good.

421
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:13,284
Don't do that.

422
00:33:13,451 --> 00:33:15,870
Sorry. I felt bad about you
coming down here by yourself.

423
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:18,331
Well, maybe next time
like a "Hello, hey, I'm here"...

424
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:19,874
something like that
might be nice.

425
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:22,543
Fine. Did you find
any access?

426
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,921
No, I haven't seen anything.

427
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:27,590
<i>- Let's get the hell out of here.
- All right.</i>

428
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:55,159
God, I hope this old truck
holds together.

429
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:58,037
Do you think these things
are still following us?

430
00:33:58,204 --> 00:33:59,330
I imagine so, ma'am.

431
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:02,208
Well, what the hell are they?
Some military experiment gone wrong?

432
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:04,210
You guys are something else,
you know that?

433
00:34:04,377 --> 00:34:07,004
<i>- My friend's dead thanks to you.
- All right, you need to back off, son.</i>

434
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:09,632
These things are a freak of nature.
I saw something like it in Afghanistan.

435
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:12,135
<i>- So you brought them back with you?
- I don't know how they got here,</i>

436
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:14,220
but we're all in the same boat now.
And if we don't deal

437
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:16,723
with these things fast,
it's gonna get real ugly around here.

438
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:26,691
Hell, we must be going up Wilson's
grade, the way this thing's rattling.

439
00:34:26,858 --> 00:34:28,568
I don't think
she's gonna make it.

440
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:30,069
Any mechanics on board?

441
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:32,280
We might be able to make it
to the gypsum plant.

442
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:34,365
It's about half a mile from here.
We could wait it out there.

443
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:36,409
That's not a good idea.

444
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:38,411
Well, you got a better one?

445
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:40,955
<i>- Got four walls and a roof?
- The place is like a bunker.</i>

446
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:42,832
I mean it's ugly as hell, but...

447
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:44,709
All right, then we're going
to the gypsum plant.

448
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:46,669
All right, well, you're gonna have to
make a right along this road.

449
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:47,879
Just look for the sign.

450
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:51,257
Sergeant, there's a sign up ahead.
We're gonna make a right-hand turn...

451
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:52,800
gypsum plant.

452
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:54,051
Got it, sir.

453
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:56,137
Do you think
we'll be safe there?

454
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:58,181
Anything's better
than this truck.

455
00:34:59,307 --> 00:35:02,685
This is Captain Sturges.
Put me through to Major Kearns.

456
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:05,605
<i>- This is Kearns.
- Major, yes, sir, we're headed north.</i>

457
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:09,484
Unfortunately we're dealing
with some very large spiders.

458
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,861
<i>- Spiders?
- Yes, sir, I said spiders.</i>

459
00:35:12,028 --> 00:35:14,363
Hello?

460
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:18,576
<i>- Damn it.
- Do you think he got that last part?</i>

461
00:35:20,328 --> 00:35:23,122
So much for Vegas, huh?

462
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:43,768
So how do you feel about
an armed populace, Captain?

463
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:46,604
You know how to handle
an M-16?

464
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,817
Hell, I learned how to fire one of them
before I knew how to drive.

465
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:53,194
How about you, Joe?

466
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:56,531
Well, I'm insulted
that you even asked.

467
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:07,416
Now what, Captain?
The gates are chained.

468
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:10,086
We don't have any time to fiddle
with the lock. Drive on through it.

469
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:13,172
You will do no such thing.
This is private property.

470
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:15,007
Give him the keys.

471
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:20,847
Be my guest.

472
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:27,603
Go ahead, Sergeant.
Ram through it.

473
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,522
With pleasure.

474
00:36:59,427 --> 00:37:01,304
Everybody out.
Let's go.

475
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,139
I'll keep an eye
on the perimeter.

476
00:37:03,306 --> 00:37:05,057
Honey, come on.

477
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:07,101
Sharon.

478
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:08,477
Come on.

479
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:10,396
<i>- Are they getting closer?
- Just keep moving.</i>

480
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:12,231
We can stay in the offices
up on the second floor.

481
00:37:12,398 --> 00:37:14,692
There's some water, some
vending machines and a few sofas.

482
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:16,736
All right, I'll hit the breakers.

483
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:19,155
<i>- Hey, take this, will you?
- No, thanks, tough guy.</i>

484
00:37:19,322 --> 00:37:21,240
<i>- You're gonna need it.
- If he doesn't want it, I'll take it.</i>

485
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:23,075
<i>- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Help me get the weapons out, will you?</i>

486
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:25,745
<i>- Go, go.
- Hurry up.</i>

487
00:37:25,912 --> 00:37:27,496
<i>- Who has the damn key?
- Open it, damn it.</i>

488
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:30,708
<i>I got it. I got it.</i>

489
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:33,586
Go, go, go, go, go.

490
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:36,255
- I'll get the lights.
- Come on, hurry up.

491
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:39,258
Come on, come on.

492
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:41,677
<i>- Let's go, come on.
- Make sure you lock that tight.</i>

493
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:43,512
Hurry up.

494
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,222
<i>Let's go.</i>

495
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:46,849
Yeah!

496
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,812
Come with me, honey.
Come here. Come here.

497
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:57,610
This way, everybody.
Come on.

498
00:37:57,777 --> 00:37:59,236
All right, everybody,
this is it.

499
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:06,786
<i>- No reception in here.
- No cell signals, only landlines,</i>

500
00:38:06,953 --> 00:38:08,704
and they were disconnected
last month.

501
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:10,247
Ma, I gotta go.

502
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:12,833
Restrooms are down the hall
to the left, if anyone needs them.

503
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,752
Come on, sweetie,
I'll go with you.

504
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:17,713
You know, it's too bad we don't have
Internet service up here.

505
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,882
It sure would be nice to see
what we're up against.

506
00:38:20,049 --> 00:38:22,301
Well, best I can tell, we brought them
back with us from overseas.

507
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:24,428
As I said, military screw-up
all the way.

508
00:38:24,595 --> 00:38:26,681
Pipe down, slick.

509
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:32,144
I have a question:
How do we get rid of 'em?

510
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:34,563
Kill the queen, right?

511
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:38,109
Spiders don't have queens.
It's not gonna be that easy.

512
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:40,277
Well, good thing
we brought these.

513
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:12,852
Jenny, it's Jimmy Ray.

514
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:15,062
I'm at the general store.
Are you sure about that report?

515
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:18,733
Well, two people
did call in to report about screams.

516
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:20,901
Okay, I'll check it out.

517
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,962
Maybe we could build
a giant spider trap.

518
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:43,257
Really? What would a giant
spider trap look like?

519
00:39:43,424 --> 00:39:46,761
That's not our concern. The army made
this mess. Let them clean it up.

520
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:48,888
You ever seen the army
clean up a mess before?

521
00:39:50,598 --> 00:39:52,641
Just be careful
what you wish for.

522
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:56,645
<i>- This blows.
- Stop being so negative.</i>

523
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:58,564
<i>- Patty's right.
- I am?</i>

524
00:39:58,731 --> 00:40:00,566
Yes, in the morning
we will devise a plan

525
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:02,943
<i>- to get everybody out of here safely.
- Well, that's great,</i>

526
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,571
except that I have a busload of tourists
coming in at dawn.

527
00:40:05,738 --> 00:40:08,157
There's not much we can do for them
now, is there? We hope for the best.

528
00:40:08,324 --> 00:40:10,701
Sheriff, keep an eye on everybody.
I'm gonna get the lay of the land,

529
00:40:10,868 --> 00:40:13,120
check for vulnerabilities.
Let's go, Sergeant.

530
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:14,789
Yes, sir.

531
00:40:20,086 --> 00:40:22,630
I still can't believe this day.

532
00:40:22,797 --> 00:40:26,133
Hey, we're gonna be okay.

533
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:30,054
Did you guys hear that?

534
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:31,764
No, but I'm ready for it.

535
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:34,975
<i>- You checked the basement, right?
- Yeah. Yeah, it was fine.</i>

536
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:38,521
<i>- Is it? Seriously?
- Yeah, nothing.</i>

537
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:54,662
I think it's coming
from behind the grate.

538
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:06,757
Ash, I wouldn't do that
if I was you.

539
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:25,359
I don't hear it any more.

540
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:33,617
See? The basement's probably
the safest room in the house.

541
00:41:33,784 --> 00:41:36,620
Maybe we should just
make a run for it.

542
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:38,372
It might be okay.

543
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:41,000
Think about it, honey.
It's pitch-dark out.

544
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:44,295
If those things are out there,
we wouldn't stand a chance.

545
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:48,340
Oh, my God, why is this
happening to us?

546
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:51,343
Hey, it's okay. I'm here.

547
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:54,513
I should go check things out
upstairs.

548
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:02,021
You guys try to get
some sleep, all right?

549
00:42:02,188 --> 00:42:04,607
I'll take first watch.

550
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:06,817
I'll have a bird's-eye view
from up here.

551
00:42:06,984 --> 00:42:09,653
<i>- Be careful.
- I will.</i>

552
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:14,575
So do you have any plans
for this summer?

553
00:42:14,742 --> 00:42:16,869
Nothing.

554
00:42:17,036 --> 00:42:18,871
We're going to Italy.

555
00:42:19,038 --> 00:42:22,041
On our honeymoon.

556
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:24,376
You guys are
getting married?

557
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:26,712
Congratulations.
When's the big day?

558
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:29,506
- Well...
- April 8th.

559
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:33,469
But that's already past.

560
00:42:33,636 --> 00:42:35,554
We just decided to do it.

561
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:37,723
We're gonna deal with whatever,
when and if.

562
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,225
Best of luck to you both.

563
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:41,227
Thank you.

564
00:42:47,483 --> 00:42:49,568
Look at your beautiful hair.

565
00:42:51,237 --> 00:42:54,156
<i>- Mom.
- Yes, baby?</i>

566
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:56,992
Are we gonna die?

567
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,207
No.

568
00:43:03,374 --> 00:43:05,084
We are not going to die.

569
00:43:05,251 --> 00:43:07,836
We're gonna be just fine.

570
00:43:09,338 --> 00:43:12,758
Well, if we're not gonna die,

571
00:43:12,925 --> 00:43:17,304
then can you and Daddy
get back together?

572
00:43:17,471 --> 00:43:18,555
I don't know.

573
00:43:18,722 --> 00:43:21,558
Okay.

574
00:43:21,725 --> 00:43:23,310
Are you all set?

575
00:43:23,477 --> 00:43:24,520
Yeah.

576
00:43:24,687 --> 00:43:26,563
Let's go get some sleep.

577
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,732
Okay.

578
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,576
So tell me what's worse...

579
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:42,037
the Taliban or these spiders?

580
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:45,541
Technically they're not spiders.
They only have six legs, so...

581
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,918
Okay, thanks for the clarification,
Professor,

582
00:43:48,085 --> 00:43:50,045
but you still didn't answer
my question.

583
00:43:50,212 --> 00:43:52,381
I hate spiders.

584
00:43:52,548 --> 00:43:54,425
They bite.

585
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:56,593
So do I.

586
00:44:02,516 --> 00:44:04,518
Do you think this place
is gonna keep them out?

587
00:44:04,685 --> 00:44:07,938
Who knows? We've still got a lot
of real estate to investigate.

588
00:44:08,105 --> 00:44:10,316
Might be some open doors
in the basement. You never know.

589
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:11,900
Are we gonna go
in the basement?

590
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:13,610
What, are you scared?

591
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:17,364
No. Well, maybe a little.
Aren't you?

592
00:44:17,531 --> 00:44:20,075
That information
is classified.

593
00:44:21,327 --> 00:44:23,662
Yeah, right.

594
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:32,338
You know any Coldplay?

595
00:44:32,504 --> 00:44:34,548
Is that by Hank Williams?

596
00:44:34,715 --> 00:44:37,384
It's the name of a band.

597
00:44:37,551 --> 00:44:40,429
Never heard of 'em.
Guess you're out of luck.

598
00:44:52,358 --> 00:44:54,360
You know, if those two hicks
that own the diner

599
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:56,070
don't make it
out of here alive,

600
00:44:56,236 --> 00:44:58,280
that's one less property
we have to worry about.

601
00:44:58,447 --> 00:45:00,324
We could clear it all up
in probate.

602
00:45:00,491 --> 00:45:04,244
You know, sometimes I don't know
how we ended up business partners.

603
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:08,707
Probably because you didn't
have the guts for the dirty work,

604
00:45:08,874 --> 00:45:10,709
or am I misremembering?

605
00:45:12,336 --> 00:45:14,171
You're really something,
you know that?

606
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:18,217
All I know is that if we end up
with a spider infestation,

607
00:45:18,384 --> 00:45:21,637
we can kiss that
Indian casino goodbye.

608
00:45:21,804 --> 00:45:25,474
"Native American"
is the preferred nomenclature.

609
00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:34,566
Bet you those two over there
ain't gonna want the diner any more,

610
00:45:34,733 --> 00:45:36,610
now it's filled with spiders
and everything.

611
00:45:36,777 --> 00:45:38,737
They don't want the diner, babe.

612
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:40,906
They just want the land.

613
00:45:41,073 --> 00:45:42,908
The land?

614
00:45:43,075 --> 00:45:45,327
There's nothing around
for miles.

615
00:45:45,494 --> 00:45:46,870
Not yet.

616
00:45:47,037 --> 00:45:50,082
I heard people talking.
They've got something up their sleeve.

617
00:45:50,249 --> 00:45:52,626
Really?

618
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:56,004
All right,
let's jack up the price,

619
00:45:56,171 --> 00:45:58,382
take 'em for all they've got,

620
00:45:58,549 --> 00:46:01,051
retire early

621
00:46:01,218 --> 00:46:03,345
and go to Hawaii,

622
00:46:03,512 --> 00:46:06,265
like you said, hmm?

623
00:46:06,432 --> 00:46:08,725
Lots of fishing,

624
00:46:08,892 --> 00:46:12,771
drinks with little umbrellas.

625
00:46:14,398 --> 00:46:16,442
I knew something wasn't right
with those two

626
00:46:16,608 --> 00:46:19,153
the first time I met 'em,
sons of bitches.

627
00:46:22,281 --> 00:46:25,617
All right, let's bleed 'em dry.

628
00:46:27,536 --> 00:46:29,621
I guess I could get used to
beach living,

629
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:32,458
especially if it's
with little old you.

630
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:34,501
Aww.

631
00:46:34,668 --> 00:46:37,045
I love you, pumpkin.

632
00:46:41,133 --> 00:46:42,468
Hmm.

633
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:54,646
- Hi.
- Hi.

634
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:59,193
<i>- How's she doing?
- Pretty well, all things considered.</i>

635
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,236
And you?

636
00:47:01,403 --> 00:47:03,530
How are you?

637
00:47:03,697 --> 00:47:05,908
Let's just say
I wasn't expecting this

638
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:09,161
when we left the house
this morning.

639
00:47:09,328 --> 00:47:11,413
I guess we should have
pulled off

640
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:14,041
and stopped at KFC
when she wanted to, huh?

641
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:16,585
Yeah.

642
00:47:28,514 --> 00:47:29,890
Hey.

643
00:47:31,308 --> 00:47:33,185
Hey.

644
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:37,606
Do you mind?

645
00:47:37,773 --> 00:47:39,691
Be my guest.

646
00:47:39,858 --> 00:47:42,236
Look, I'm sorry
about your friend.

647
00:47:43,445 --> 00:47:45,280
Was he your roommate?

648
00:47:45,447 --> 00:47:47,866
Yeah.

649
00:47:49,743 --> 00:47:52,246
I'm Patty, by the way.

650
00:47:53,497 --> 00:47:55,082
You know how to use
that thing?

651
00:47:55,249 --> 00:47:57,084
This?

652
00:47:57,251 --> 00:47:59,795
Not yet. But I always used to
go hunting with my dad

653
00:47:59,962 --> 00:48:02,965
and I'm sure I can figure it out.
You just aim and like...

654
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:04,591
Whoa, hey, hey, hey.

655
00:48:04,758 --> 00:48:06,969
Watch where you're
pointing that thing.

656
00:48:07,135 --> 00:48:09,096
Sorry. It's just a gun.

657
00:48:09,263 --> 00:48:12,391
Well, how come
you don't want a gun?

658
00:48:12,558 --> 00:48:14,893
I'm a pacifist.

659
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,937
Chicks dig it.

660
00:48:17,104 --> 00:48:19,856
So I don't need a picture of me
holding an M-16

661
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:21,942
showing up on Facebook.

662
00:48:22,109 --> 00:48:24,611
I'm sure that's like the least
of your worries right now.

663
00:48:24,778 --> 00:48:28,156
What do I need a gun for when I have
a real-life GI Joe protecting me?

664
00:48:28,323 --> 00:48:30,200
You know,

665
00:48:30,367 --> 00:48:32,953
if sarcasm worked better
on these bugs than bullets,

666
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,456
then you would be
the first person I'd call.

667
00:48:39,793 --> 00:48:41,295
Thanks.

668
00:48:51,013 --> 00:48:53,307
I wonder what's behind here.

669
00:48:54,683 --> 00:48:56,560
It's locked.

670
00:48:56,727 --> 00:48:59,354
Yeah, I don't think anything
could get through that.

671
00:49:00,814 --> 00:49:03,275
Come on, let's go upstairs
and get some rest.

672
00:49:17,497 --> 00:49:19,041
Anything?

673
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:20,626
Nothing. It's totally quiet.

674
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:22,669
Okay, get some shuteye.
I'll take over.

675
00:49:22,836 --> 00:49:24,504
All right.

676
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:26,673
<i>- Hey, Ash.
- What?</i>

677
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,009
You do good under pressure,
I'll give you that.

678
00:49:29,176 --> 00:49:31,219
Thanks, but it's all a bluster.

679
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:33,347
I'm just as scared
as everybody else.

680
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:35,641
I don't believe that.

681
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:07,047
- Cover me, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

682
00:50:15,222 --> 00:50:18,392
Medic!

683
00:50:29,653 --> 00:50:31,863
Are you okay, sir?

684
00:50:33,448 --> 00:50:35,325
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

685
00:50:35,492 --> 00:50:38,578
Just a... just a bad dream,
I guess.

686
00:50:39,746 --> 00:50:41,123
Do you always have...?

687
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:43,750
No, I don't.

688
00:50:43,917 --> 00:50:45,961
Okay, sir.

689
00:51:16,116 --> 00:51:17,576
Oh, great.

690
00:51:32,883 --> 00:51:33,925
Good morning, sir.

691
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:36,303
Not this morning, Sergeant.
Anyone seen the sheriff?

692
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:38,305
Yeah, I think he went
up to the roof for a smoke.

693
00:51:38,472 --> 00:51:40,640
<i>- How's the coffee?
- It's warm at least.</i>

694
00:52:03,914 --> 00:52:05,499
I'll be damned.

695
00:52:18,595 --> 00:52:20,680
Joe, Reba, grab your weapons.
Sergeant, stay here,

696
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:22,891
<i>- keep everyone safe.
- Yes, sir.</i>

697
00:52:45,372 --> 00:52:48,291
<i>- Ken.
- Stay with me, Sheriff.</i>

698
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:51,086
Oh. There's a truck over there.

699
00:52:51,253 --> 00:52:54,089
Come on, let's get you inside.
Can you stand up?

700
00:52:58,468 --> 00:53:00,053
Damn it.

701
00:53:03,223 --> 00:53:04,724
Let's get him inside.

702
00:53:04,891 --> 00:53:07,185
Come on, help me out.

703
00:53:18,572 --> 00:53:20,448
What the hell was that?

704
00:53:20,615 --> 00:53:22,200
Where's Carl?

705
00:53:22,367 --> 00:53:24,786
The spiders
must have got in.

706
00:53:24,953 --> 00:53:27,581
<i>- Carl? Carl, honey, I'm coming.
- Traci, Traci, stay here. Stay here.</i>

707
00:53:27,747 --> 00:53:29,749
- No!
- Ashley, hold her right here, okay?

708
00:53:29,916 --> 00:53:31,543
<i>- Let me go.
- Stay here. Stay here.</i>

709
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:33,628
<i>- It'll be okay.
- Carl, are you all right?</i>

710
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:37,757
- He is not all right. Carl!
- Will will get him, okay?

711
00:53:37,924 --> 00:53:40,302
Carl? Carl?

712
00:53:40,468 --> 00:53:42,095
He's not saying anything.
Carl!

713
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:51,521
Carl.

714
00:53:53,481 --> 00:53:55,525
This isn't funny, man.

715
00:54:09,623 --> 00:54:11,625
Carl!

716
00:55:03,176 --> 00:55:05,178
They got in.

717
00:55:08,181 --> 00:55:11,226
- Where's Carl?
- I'm sorry. They got him.

718
00:55:11,393 --> 00:55:13,061
No. God, no.

719
00:55:13,228 --> 00:55:15,188
<i>- Where are they?
- In the second bedroom.</i>

720
00:55:15,355 --> 00:55:17,190
They must have come in
through the skylight or something.

721
00:55:17,357 --> 00:55:18,900
I shut the door, but it ain't
gonna hold them for long.

722
00:55:19,067 --> 00:55:20,860
<i>- We gotta get the hell out of here.
- What about her?</i>

723
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:23,029
Drag her along.
I'm gonna check the front door.

724
00:55:23,196 --> 00:55:25,448
<i>- You've got to keep it together.
- No, this isn't happening.</i>

725
00:55:25,615 --> 00:55:27,033
<i>- Come on.
- Carl.</i>

726
00:55:34,374 --> 00:55:36,292
You've got to keep it together, Traci.
Keep it together.

727
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:38,128
<i>- They're all over the porch.
- Damn.</i>

728
00:55:38,294 --> 00:55:39,796
We're all gonna die. Just let me die.

729
00:55:39,963 --> 00:55:41,673
Let's make a run through
the back door.

730
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,717
<i>- We can run for our cars.
- It's worth a shot. Come on.</i>

731
00:55:43,883 --> 00:55:45,885
<i>- Come on.
- Traci, come on.</i>

732
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:54,769
Do you think it's safe?

733
00:55:54,936 --> 00:55:56,813
It's our best bet.

734
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:00,066
If we stay in here longer,
we're gonna be overrun by those things.

735
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:09,909
Traci, I need you
to hang in there for me, okay?

736
00:56:10,076 --> 00:56:12,328
Carl wouldn't want you
to give up now, understand?

737
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:14,914
Are you guys ready?

738
00:56:15,081 --> 00:56:18,043
Okay, let's go.
Come on, come on.

739
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,422
Come on.

740
00:56:28,344 --> 00:56:30,430
Sarge. Hey, Sarge.

741
00:56:30,597 --> 00:56:33,058
<i>- Are we at the motel yet?
- No, Sergeant, but I thought...</i>

742
00:56:33,224 --> 00:56:34,392
Why did you wake me up?

743
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,270
I told you not to wake me up
until we get to the motel.

744
00:56:37,437 --> 00:56:39,147
Well, I know, Sergeant,
but I thought...

745
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:07,842
<i>- Are we there yet?
- No, but there's a diner over there.</i>

746
00:57:08,009 --> 00:57:10,303
I thought we could stop
for some breakfast.

747
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:12,764
On, come on, Sarge.
I can smell the bacon over here.

748
00:57:12,931 --> 00:57:14,307
No, we better
keep moving.

749
00:57:14,474 --> 00:57:17,060
Kearns wants us there as soon
as possible. Come on.

750
00:57:30,198 --> 00:57:31,991
How many more of those
do you think there are?

751
00:57:32,158 --> 00:57:34,410
It's hard to tell,
but we're not safe here any more.

752
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:36,496
Maybe we killed
all those nasty things.

753
00:57:36,663 --> 00:57:38,498
No way.
Those were just scouts.

754
00:57:38,665 --> 00:57:40,583
Pretty soon this place will be
crawling with them.

755
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:43,211
Then maybe we should, like,
leave or something.

756
00:57:43,378 --> 00:57:45,171
If I can make it to that truck,
we might be able

757
00:57:45,338 --> 00:57:46,965
to make it to safer ground
and call for help.

758
00:57:47,132 --> 00:57:48,925
That's a suicide mission.

759
00:57:49,092 --> 00:57:50,802
How else are we supposed
to get out of here?

760
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:53,680
Joe's right. The truck we
came in with has a blown clutch.

761
00:57:53,847 --> 00:57:55,348
It is not safe out there.

762
00:57:55,515 --> 00:57:57,517
College boy
might be right for once.

763
00:57:59,936 --> 00:58:02,522
Is there any way to get to that truck
without marching across that open field?

764
00:58:02,689 --> 00:58:05,108
Well, there's a series of corridors
down in the sub-basement.

765
00:58:05,275 --> 00:58:07,110
They used them to move chemicals
and whatnot around the plant.

766
00:58:07,277 --> 00:58:08,903
They should get you pretty close
to the loading dock.

767
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:10,947
How do we even know
this truck runs?

768
00:58:11,114 --> 00:58:12,824
It ran two weeks ago.
I saw it myself.

769
00:58:12,991 --> 00:58:14,701
All right, well,
I'm willing to take that chance.

770
00:58:14,868 --> 00:58:16,828
Sergeant and I will go down there
and bring the truck around.

771
00:58:16,995 --> 00:58:19,372
The rest of you guys stay put. I don't
want to attract any undue attention.

772
00:58:19,539 --> 00:58:22,000
Gentlemen, do you mind
leading the way?

773
00:58:23,084 --> 00:58:25,170
Sure, I'll take you down.

774
00:58:27,505 --> 00:58:29,883
<i>- Ready, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.</i>

775
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:35,889
Putz.

776
00:58:38,308 --> 00:58:39,851
Here it is.

777
00:58:41,728 --> 00:58:43,062
Are you all right?

778
00:58:43,229 --> 00:58:46,316
Yeah. Just take the stairs down.
It splits off into either direction.

779
00:58:46,482 --> 00:58:48,193
I honestly don't remember
which way to go.

780
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:50,069
All right, I got it.
Any lights down there?

781
00:58:50,236 --> 00:58:51,821
Just emergency lights.
That's all we have.

782
00:58:51,988 --> 00:58:53,114
Okay.

783
00:58:53,281 --> 00:58:55,033
<i>- Good luck.
- Thanks.</i>

784
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,243
<i>- I'll be upstairs.
- Okay.</i>

785
00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:00,079
<i>- Are you ready, Sergeant?
- Ready as I'm ever gonna be.</i>

786
00:59:00,246 --> 00:59:02,123
<i>Okay.</i>

787
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:04,167
Well, looks like we're back
to playing soldier again.

788
00:59:04,334 --> 00:59:06,544
Yeah, an old habit.

789
00:59:06,711 --> 00:59:08,379
I tell you,
if we make it through this,

790
00:59:08,546 --> 00:59:10,256
your first, second
and third rounds are on me

791
00:59:10,423 --> 00:59:12,091
and you can call me
whatever you want.

792
00:59:12,258 --> 00:59:14,510
<i>I'm gonna hold you to that.</i>

793
00:59:15,553 --> 00:59:17,597
What? You see something?

794
00:59:17,764 --> 00:59:19,098
I guess not.

795
00:59:19,265 --> 00:59:21,851
Well, if anything's down there,
we're pretty much screwed.

796
00:59:22,018 --> 00:59:23,061
Yep.

797
00:59:23,228 --> 00:59:25,480
Thank you. That's where
you were supposed to reassure me.

798
00:59:25,647 --> 00:59:29,025
Okay. If we get ambushed
by spiders,

799
00:59:29,192 --> 00:59:31,110
just shoot them all
and everything will be fine.

800
00:59:31,277 --> 00:59:33,696
Thank you.
I feel so much better.

801
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:46,459
Oh, boy,
this looks like fun.

802
00:59:46,626 --> 00:59:48,753
Can't wait.

803
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,922
Ay-yi-yi. They could be
coming in from anywhere.

804
00:59:51,089 --> 00:59:53,549
When was the last time
anyone was even down here?

805
00:59:53,716 --> 00:59:56,135
Okay, let's spread out.

806
00:59:56,302 --> 00:59:57,303
Yes, sir.

807
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:59,639
<i>- Keep your eyes open, eh?
- Do I have to?</i>

808
00:59:59,806 --> 01:00:02,642
Man, this is creepy.

809
01:00:03,726 --> 01:00:05,728
Okay.

810
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:45,078
Captain!

811
01:01:47,997 --> 01:01:49,540
Think they're okay?

812
01:01:49,707 --> 01:01:51,584
Well, there's nothing
we can do about it.

813
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,421
If they're in trouble,
we're in trouble.

814
01:01:55,588 --> 01:01:57,090
I'm going down there
to see if I can help.

815
01:01:57,256 --> 01:01:58,466
Daddy, no, don't.

816
01:02:00,426 --> 01:02:03,888
It's gonna be fine, sweetie.
This is what daddies do.

817
01:02:17,235 --> 01:02:18,903
I'll come with you.

818
01:02:31,124 --> 01:02:33,626
<i>- Spiders?
- And then some. Let's go. Move out.</i>

819
01:02:35,253 --> 01:02:37,255
Go.

820
01:02:41,259 --> 01:02:42,885
<i>- We're here.
- Captain.</i>

821
01:02:43,052 --> 01:02:45,263
We're here. We've got to get back
upstairs. We've got to get out of here.

822
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:47,849
Yes. Oh, jeez, they're here.

823
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:50,059
All right, go, go, go, go, go.

824
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:53,938
Get out of here, Sergeant, go.

825
01:02:55,523 --> 01:02:57,733
No, sir, we haven't been able
to locate Captain Sturges.

826
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,569
No, no sign
of the truck either.

827
01:02:59,735 --> 01:03:01,487
<i>- Keep looking.
- Will do.</i>

828
01:03:01,654 --> 01:03:03,322
What did you find?

829
01:03:03,489 --> 01:03:04,866
Nothing.
There's nobody here.

830
01:03:05,032 --> 01:03:06,742
What do you mean, nothing?
What about the manager?

831
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:08,661
Like I said, no guests,
no manager... nothing.

832
01:03:08,828 --> 01:03:10,246
I don't like this.

833
01:03:10,413 --> 01:03:12,832
<i>- What did the major have to say?
- He said the last message</i>

834
01:03:12,999 --> 01:03:15,334
that he received from Captain Sturges
was a garbled distress call.

835
01:03:15,501 --> 01:03:17,753
Do you think it has anything to do
with this place being deserted?

836
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,465
I don't know, but I don't think we
should sit around and wait to find out.

837
01:03:20,631 --> 01:03:22,675
Let's get back on the road,
trying to find that truck.

838
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:24,635
It couldn't have gotten that far
with a blown clutch.

839
01:03:33,978 --> 01:03:35,521
Come on.

840
01:03:35,688 --> 01:03:38,065
Get her in the back seat.
I'll get her started.

841
01:03:43,696 --> 01:03:46,324
<i>- What's the matter?
- It won't start.</i>

842
01:03:46,491 --> 01:03:48,993
<i>- What do you mean, it won't start?
- I don't know. It won't crank over.</i>

843
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,537
<i>- Well, we're gonna have to check it.
- All right.</i>

844
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:03,716
Oh, my God.

845
01:04:05,301 --> 01:04:06,719
Oh, my God.

846
01:04:12,975 --> 01:04:15,853
Is anyone else starting to freak out?
'Cause I know I'm starting to freak out.

847
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,397
<i>- They've been gone, like, forever.
- All right, let's head downstairs</i>

848
01:04:18,564 --> 01:04:20,191
so we're ready when they
bring the truck around.

849
01:04:20,358 --> 01:04:22,235
I'm just fine right where I am,
thank you.

850
01:04:22,401 --> 01:04:24,237
What the hell happened
down there?

851
01:04:24,403 --> 01:04:26,280
The basement is covered with spiders.
I think it's time for plan B.

852
01:04:26,447 --> 01:04:28,407
<i>- What's plan B?
- I don't know. I'm working on it.</i>

853
01:04:28,574 --> 01:04:30,576
<i>- Well, you'd better work fast.
- How about an overland route?</i>

854
01:04:30,743 --> 01:04:33,037
<i>- That's too dangerous.
- I didn't ask you. Captain?</i>

855
01:04:33,204 --> 01:04:35,373
I think it's our only option. I think
we've got to fight our way out of here.

856
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:36,707
<i>- Count me in.
- Yeah, me, too.</i>

857
01:04:36,874 --> 01:04:39,085
Reba, I want you to stay with us.
Joe, I want you to go on the roof.

858
01:04:39,252 --> 01:04:41,504
If you see any spiders, you let them
have it. Go to channel five.

859
01:04:41,671 --> 01:04:43,422
- Okay.
Anybody else?

860
01:04:44,757 --> 01:04:45,758
I'll go.

861
01:04:45,925 --> 01:04:47,426
I didn't think this was
your type of thing, kid.

862
01:04:47,593 --> 01:04:49,637
Let's just say I'm beginning
to see the light.

863
01:04:49,804 --> 01:04:51,764
I'm coming, too.

864
01:04:51,931 --> 01:04:53,599
Ladies, I'll see you outside.

865
01:05:00,606 --> 01:05:02,692
All right,
everybody listen up.

866
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:04,944
I know nobody has
any combat training,

867
01:05:05,111 --> 01:05:07,405
but we stay together.
We work as a team.

868
01:05:07,572 --> 01:05:10,241
We're gonna get through this okay.
Anything you want to add, Sergeant?

869
01:05:10,408 --> 01:05:12,159
If it gets ugly out there,
just remember,

870
01:05:12,326 --> 01:05:14,078
cover your buddy's
ass,okay?

871
01:05:14,245 --> 01:05:16,831
If you're not sure what to do,
just follow Sturges' lead.

872
01:05:16,998 --> 01:05:18,165
So what are we
supposed to do?

873
01:05:18,332 --> 01:05:20,459
There's guns in the other room.
Use them.

874
01:05:20,626 --> 01:05:22,962
Doesn't sound like much
of a plan to me.

875
01:05:23,129 --> 01:05:26,007
<i>- Everybody ready?
- Okay, let's do it.</i>

876
01:05:26,173 --> 01:05:28,593
<i>- Yes.
- Then let's move out.</i>

877
01:05:31,387 --> 01:05:32,972
<i>- All right.
- Good luck, you guys.</i>

878
01:05:33,139 --> 01:05:34,390
Good luck.

879
01:05:49,447 --> 01:05:52,742
Hey, how does this thing work?

880
01:05:52,908 --> 01:05:54,368
Oh, it's really simple.

881
01:05:54,535 --> 01:05:56,495
See, this is your safety.
See the off position?

882
01:05:56,662 --> 01:05:58,623
You want to turn it,
make sure it's in the off position.

883
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:00,458
<i>- Okay.
- You've got your clip back here,</i>

884
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:02,668
pulls out, tap it, real tight.

885
01:06:02,835 --> 01:06:05,171
And you want to just aim

886
01:06:05,338 --> 01:06:07,506
and shoot.

887
01:06:07,673 --> 01:06:09,008
That's it.

888
01:06:09,175 --> 01:06:11,177
Just make sure you keep your sights
off me, okay?

889
01:06:11,344 --> 01:06:13,304
- Okay.
- All right. You'll be fine.

890
01:06:27,026 --> 01:06:30,363
Major Kearns,
Captain Sturges.

891
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:33,449
Yes, sir.
No, sir.

892
01:06:33,616 --> 01:06:35,409
We're in great danger, sir.

893
01:06:35,576 --> 01:06:38,329
No, sir. We are...

894
01:06:38,496 --> 01:06:41,374
we're being overrun
by camel spiders, sir.

895
01:06:43,042 --> 01:06:44,627
Yes, sir.

896
01:06:44,794 --> 01:06:47,046
Look, I need you to bomb this place
out of existence.

897
01:06:47,213 --> 01:06:49,090
Can you triangulate my signal?

898
01:06:49,256 --> 01:06:51,467
<i>Major Kearns?</i>

899
01:06:51,634 --> 01:06:53,844
Major Kearns.

900
01:06:55,262 --> 01:06:57,056
Damn it.

901
01:07:00,309 --> 01:07:01,894
How does it look
out there, Joe?

902
01:07:02,061 --> 01:07:04,522
You've got a clear path
all the way to the truck,

903
01:07:04,689 --> 01:07:06,357
Captain, for now at least.

904
01:07:06,524 --> 01:07:07,900
Let's hope it stays
that way.

905
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:10,569
I hear that.
I got you covered from up here,

906
01:07:10,736 --> 01:07:12,738
so you just do
what you gotta do.

907
01:07:14,031 --> 01:07:16,450
All right, I'll take the point.
You guys stay close behind me.

908
01:07:16,617 --> 01:07:19,078
Sergeant, bring up the rear.
Don't forget, those things are quick,

909
01:07:19,245 --> 01:07:21,288
<i>- so watch our flank.
- Got it.</i>

910
01:07:21,455 --> 01:07:23,708
<i>- Where's our flank?
- To the side.</i>

911
01:07:25,793 --> 01:07:28,087
Are you all right, soldier?

912
01:07:28,254 --> 01:07:31,215
Yeah. Yeah. I was just thinking about
how much I hate spiders.

913
01:07:31,382 --> 01:07:33,676
Be glad they're not bigger,
or we'd all be screwed.

914
01:07:33,843 --> 01:07:35,594
All right, time to earn
our paycheck.

915
01:07:48,107 --> 01:07:49,942
Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

916
01:07:50,109 --> 01:07:52,945
<i>- Over there.
- Over there.</i>

917
01:07:54,739 --> 01:07:56,782
On your right, Captain.

918
01:08:05,124 --> 01:08:08,002
On your left.
Look out. Keep moving.

919
01:08:14,133 --> 01:08:17,470
Looks like the little devils are trying
some sort of pincer move.

920
01:08:17,636 --> 01:08:20,014
Come on. On your left.
On your left. Go, go.

921
01:08:22,141 --> 01:08:24,310
Hurry.

922
01:08:24,477 --> 01:08:25,478
Move it.

923
01:08:25,644 --> 01:08:27,772
Go! Go, go, go!

924
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,032
Come on!

925
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:41,994
Come on, hop in, hop in, hop in.

926
01:08:42,161 --> 01:08:43,996
Go!

927
01:08:44,163 --> 01:08:46,081
Go, go, go!

928
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:49,335
Come on.

929
01:08:49,502 --> 01:08:50,878
Hurry up.

930
01:08:51,045 --> 01:08:52,630
I thought you said
that thing ran.

931
01:08:52,797 --> 01:08:54,340
<i>- It did.
- Yeah, last week.</i>

932
01:08:54,507 --> 01:08:55,966
Will they get it started?

933
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:59,178
They're working on it, sweetie.
You just wait. Daddy's gonna save us.

934
01:08:59,345 --> 01:09:01,096
I wouldn't count on it.

935
01:09:03,682 --> 01:09:06,018
GO! Go!

936
01:09:10,022 --> 01:09:11,732
Go, go, go, go!

937
01:09:11,899 --> 01:09:13,692
Yeah, baby. Go!

938
01:09:18,531 --> 01:09:20,533
Son of a bitch.

939
01:09:27,414 --> 01:09:29,208
They're everywhere.

940
01:09:46,058 --> 01:09:47,434
Oh, my God,
here they come.

941
01:09:47,601 --> 01:09:50,062
Damn it, you little bastards.

942
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:51,564
Go, go!

943
01:10:01,532 --> 01:10:03,742
Okay, watch our backs.

944
01:10:19,091 --> 01:10:22,428
We made it. I can't believe
that we actually made it.

945
01:10:22,595 --> 01:10:24,597
We're not
out of the woods yet.

946
01:10:27,433 --> 01:10:28,767
Captain.

947
01:10:33,022 --> 01:10:35,232
Let's not try that again,
Sergeant.

948
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:37,401
Yes, sir.

949
01:10:40,779 --> 01:10:43,032
Did you see? They made it.
Can we go now?

950
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:45,159
Not so fast.
The captain said wait here until...

951
01:10:45,326 --> 01:10:47,202
I'm through waiting.
Get out of my way.

952
01:10:47,369 --> 01:10:48,954
I'm going out there
and getting on that truck.

953
01:10:49,121 --> 01:10:50,497
Stan, are you nuts?
You said yourself...

954
01:10:50,664 --> 01:10:52,708
I don't care what I said.
That's our truck

955
01:10:52,875 --> 01:10:55,836
and it's my ticket out of here.
You can stay up here if you want.

956
01:10:57,421 --> 01:10:58,631
Ass.

957
01:10:58,797 --> 01:11:00,966
Is Daddy downstairs, too?

958
01:11:01,133 --> 01:11:03,260
Yes, baby, but we can't
go down there yet.

959
01:11:03,427 --> 01:11:05,346
<i>- When can we?
- Soon.</i>

960
01:11:05,512 --> 01:11:07,640
Okay, we'll get out there.
Your husband's out there.

961
01:11:07,806 --> 01:11:09,642
Everything's okay, all right?
We'll get out there.

962
01:11:09,808 --> 01:11:11,602
Yeah, we've got
enough guns for everybody.

963
01:11:11,769 --> 01:11:13,312
Yeah, we have enough guns
for everyone. You'll have guns.

964
01:11:13,479 --> 01:11:15,689
<i>- Cain, you need something?
- Yeah.</i>

965
01:11:15,856 --> 01:11:17,733
What we'll do is we'll get
the captain on the horn;

966
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:20,152
we'll make some contact;
we'll make a plan, okay?

967
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:22,696
It's okay.
We'll get to your husband, okay?

968
01:11:33,457 --> 01:11:35,417
Hey, wait for me.

969
01:11:35,584 --> 01:11:38,545
Get back inside the building.
Back in the building.

970
01:11:38,712 --> 01:11:41,840
<i>Get back.</i>

971
01:11:59,358 --> 01:12:02,361
Sergeant, turn this
truck around.

972
01:12:02,528 --> 01:12:04,613
Get ready to get out of here.
Everybody watch the perimeter.

973
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:06,782
Yes, sir.

974
01:12:13,288 --> 01:12:15,290
Dad?

975
01:12:17,209 --> 01:12:19,586
Dad, are you in here?

976
01:12:22,047 --> 01:12:24,425
Dad.

977
01:12:28,762 --> 01:12:30,889
<i>- Joe, can you read me?
- Yeah, go ahead, Captain.</i>

978
01:12:31,056 --> 01:12:32,599
We're turning the truck
around right now.

979
01:12:32,766 --> 01:12:34,435
I have reason to believe
there's spiders in the building.

980
01:12:34,601 --> 01:12:36,854
I need you to get everybody down here
as quickly as possible. Copy?

981
01:12:37,021 --> 01:12:39,481
You got it.
Okay, Patty, I'm gonna take point.

982
01:12:39,648 --> 01:12:41,900
I want you to follow up
with Mrs. Mullins and Hayley.

983
01:12:42,067 --> 01:12:43,819
<i>- Now, Cain, I want you to...
- Hayley.</i>

984
01:12:43,986 --> 01:12:46,405
Hayley.
Where's my daughter?

985
01:12:46,572 --> 01:12:49,575
She's not in here. She went to go find
her father. I'm gonna go get her.

986
01:12:49,742 --> 01:12:51,201
<i>- I've got to go. No.
- No, listen. No, you stay here.</i>

987
01:12:51,368 --> 01:12:53,370
<i>- This is my daughter.
- I will take care of it.</i>

988
01:12:53,537 --> 01:12:55,456
<i>- Do you understand?
- Listen, stay here.</i>

989
01:12:55,622 --> 01:12:57,624
<i>- Please.
- Stay.</i>

990
01:12:58,917 --> 01:13:00,919
Ladies, let's uh, grab some guns.
Watch the windows.

991
01:13:01,086 --> 01:13:05,716
Take care of you
to take care of her, okay?

992
01:13:12,848 --> 01:13:14,850
Dad.

993
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:23,192
Dad, help!

994
01:13:25,069 --> 01:13:27,446
Dad, help.

995
01:13:32,076 --> 01:13:34,745
Joe, what the hell is taking so long?
We need to get out of here right now.

996
01:13:34,912 --> 01:13:37,206
It's Cain.
The little girl went missing.

997
01:13:37,372 --> 01:13:39,666
What the hell are you talking
about, went missing? Where'd she go?

998
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:42,211
She went to find her dad.
Joe's out looking for her now.

999
01:13:43,378 --> 01:13:45,380
Hayley, get back.

1000
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:49,593
Joe, can you read me? Come back.
Joe, can you read me? Come back.

1001
01:13:52,763 --> 01:13:55,641
<i>- Underwood.
- I'm going with her.</i>

1002
01:13:55,808 --> 01:13:57,476
No, no, no, you stay here.
We'll go get her.

1003
01:13:59,311 --> 01:14:02,231
<i>- That's my daughter in there.
- The more reason for you to stay here.</i>

1004
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:24,586
Mom, Dad, help!

1005
01:14:33,512 --> 01:14:35,806
Joe. Hayley.

1006
01:14:38,517 --> 01:14:40,727
All right, I need you to get
everybody out of the offices

1007
01:14:40,894 --> 01:14:43,480
down to the back loading dock
as soon as possible. You got it?

1008
01:14:43,647 --> 01:14:44,982
Roger.

1009
01:14:45,149 --> 01:14:46,400
<i>- You heard that, right?
- Yeah.</i>

1010
01:14:46,567 --> 01:14:49,278
<i>- All right, let's go. Come on.
- Ready? Come on.</i>

1011
01:15:05,878 --> 01:15:08,338
Hayley, duck.

1012
01:15:16,263 --> 01:15:18,515
Don't worry, we're gonna
get you out of here.

1013
01:15:18,682 --> 01:15:21,185
Oh, no,
they're not in here.

1014
01:15:21,351 --> 01:15:24,563
Okay,
you're gonna be fine.

1015
01:15:31,987 --> 01:15:32,988
This is Underwood.

1016
01:15:33,155 --> 01:15:35,824
The first floor is completely
infested with spiders.

1017
01:15:35,991 --> 01:15:37,910
I'm held up in a tool shed

1018
01:15:38,076 --> 01:15:40,204
somewhere towards the back end
of the supply dock.

1019
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:43,373
But please tell the others
to get out while they can

1020
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:45,417
and warn them to be careful.

1021
01:15:45,584 --> 01:15:47,753
I'm sorry,
but Joe didn't make it.

1022
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,796
I'm fine for the moment,

1023
01:15:49,963 --> 01:15:52,424
but I'm gonna need some serious cover
to get out of here.

1024
01:15:52,591 --> 01:15:56,053
Oh, and I've got Hayley.

1025
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:58,597
She's okay. Again,

1026
01:15:58,764 --> 01:16:02,309
we're trapped inside the storage area
somewhere on the first floor.

1027
01:16:02,476 --> 01:16:04,436
Hang in there,
Sergeant.

1028
01:16:04,603 --> 01:16:06,480
I'm coming in to get you,
don't worry.

1029
01:16:06,647 --> 01:16:09,399
Yes, sir. Over.

1030
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:11,443
Thank you.

1031
01:16:19,451 --> 01:16:22,496
<i>- Come on, try to keep up.
- What if I fall and break my ankle?</i>

1032
01:16:22,663 --> 01:16:24,665
Too bad.

1033
01:16:28,794 --> 01:16:30,504
Oh, hurry up.

1034
01:16:47,646 --> 01:16:49,106
You can't help him.

1035
01:16:50,941 --> 01:16:53,151
Come on.

1036
01:16:55,487 --> 01:16:57,739
Come on, come on.

1037
01:17:02,077 --> 01:17:04,538
Did they go away?

1038
01:17:04,705 --> 01:17:06,832
I don't think so.

1039
01:17:08,667 --> 01:17:10,877
I don't see anything.

1040
01:17:11,044 --> 01:17:13,380
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
they're gone, honey.

1041
01:17:13,547 --> 01:17:15,424
Don't worry, okay?

1042
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:17,759
The captain's coming
to get us.

1043
01:17:17,926 --> 01:17:19,803
You'll be fine.

1044
01:17:29,771 --> 01:17:31,648
Oh, my God,
they're on the roof.

1045
01:17:31,815 --> 01:17:33,817
Stay back.

1046
01:17:35,694 --> 01:17:37,154
There.

1047
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:40,032
Oh, my God.

1048
01:17:40,198 --> 01:17:42,451
<i>- Where?
- Over there.</i>

1049
01:17:42,617 --> 01:17:45,203
Let's go.

1050
01:17:47,873 --> 01:17:51,209
Well, ladies, what do you say
we get the hell out of here, huh?

1051
01:17:54,296 --> 01:17:56,214
Pick the girl up.
Let's go.

1052
01:17:56,381 --> 01:17:58,383
<i>- Come on.
- Let's go. Let's go. Hurry.</i>

1053
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:00,344
<i>- My gun, sir.
- Just leave it.</i>

1054
01:18:10,062 --> 01:18:11,563
Come on.

1055
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:14,858
Oh, my God, here they come.
Give them some cover.

1056
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:19,237
Come on. Come on.

1057
01:18:21,406 --> 01:18:23,575
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1058
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,922
Sharon, come on, honey.

1059
01:18:40,717 --> 01:18:43,887
<i>- Have they got her?
- I think so.</i>

1060
01:18:47,265 --> 01:18:49,226
Oh, thank God.
She's got her.

1061
01:18:55,524 --> 01:18:57,943
<i>- There you go, sweetie.
- Mom, Mom.</i>

1062
01:18:58,110 --> 01:18:59,945
<i>- Hayley.
- Come on, sweetheart.</i>

1063
01:19:03,782 --> 01:19:05,450
All right, we need to go.

1064
01:19:05,617 --> 01:19:07,494
Get in the truck.

1065
01:19:07,661 --> 01:19:09,913
Let's get out of here.
Give me a hand.

1066
01:19:12,249 --> 01:19:14,251
Everybody hang on.

1067
01:19:45,949 --> 01:19:47,742
<i>- You think they got them all?
- I think they got enough.</i>

1068
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:49,661
We'll bring in another team
and mop up the mess.

1069
01:19:49,828 --> 01:19:52,497
It looks like the state police set up a
perimeter and are out gassing the brush

1070
01:19:52,664 --> 01:19:55,333
to flush out the remaining bugs
and torch the living crap out of them.

1071
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,961
Appreciate the report, Sergeant.

1072
01:20:03,341 --> 01:20:05,552
Are you ready to complete
our mission, Sergeant?

1073
01:20:05,719 --> 01:20:07,637
Affirmative, Captain.

1074
01:20:10,599 --> 01:20:12,350
You know those things
will kill you, right?

1075
01:20:12,517 --> 01:20:14,561
Are you gonna put
a "sir" on that?

1076
01:20:14,728 --> 01:20:17,355
Thanks for the reminder, sir.

1077
01:20:19,941 --> 01:20:23,361
You know, I believe I owe you
a couple of beers, don't I?

1078
01:20:23,528 --> 01:20:27,574
I believe you do, Mike.
