1
00:02:34,162 --> 00:02:36,323
- Paulie, how's it look?
- Snitch says the cop's body's...

2
00:02:36,397 --> 00:02:39,662
about 300 yards down
in the abandoned tunnel.

3
00:02:39,734 --> 00:02:42,100
- Howie?
- Right behind you, Captain.

4
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,604
Keep back till I process the scene.

5
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:03,440
Watch out below!

6
00:05:14,255 --> 00:05:18,487
- So where the hell is the car?
- I don't know.

7
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:22,427
- That's the last time I take a red-eye.
- Maybe we can take a cab.

8
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:25,322
I'm gonna fi re this son ofa bitch.

9
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,264
He's always got an excuse.

10
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,709
Come on, we'll be home
beforeyou know it, hmm?

11
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:37,209
Yeah.

12
00:06:16,717 --> 00:06:20,813
Excuse me. Excuse me,
I thinkyou're going the wrong way.

13
00:06:23,724 --> 00:06:29,162
Honey, honey, wake up. We're lost,
or he's taking us for a ride.

14
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,562
We're in the middle ofnowhere.

15
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:34,157
Where the hell you going?
I said Fifth Avenue.

16
00:06:37,638 --> 00:06:40,163
We're not tourists here, man.

17
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:42,573
Hey, where areyou going?

18
00:06:50,384 --> 00:06:52,318
Let us out.
Stop the car.

19
00:06:53,988 --> 00:06:56,923
- Stop this car, man!
- Stop the car!

20
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:08,527
Shit.

21
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:12,003
- Oh, my God.
- Son ofa bitch.

22
00:07:12,073 --> 00:07:14,473
Stop the goddamn car!

23
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:25,552
- Stop it, please.
- Stop the car.

24
00:07:26,854 --> 00:07:30,346
Stop this car, goddamn it!
Stop this car!

25
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,853
Good morning.

26
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:39,532
You look a little dehydrated.

27
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,797
- How about somejuice?
- How about two fi ngers ofvodka?

28
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,667
Isn't it a little early forvodka?

29
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,805
Time, as you well know,
is a relative consideration, Thelma.

30
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:50,503
-Juice.
- Vodka.

31
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,873
- Coming!
-Join me in a drink, Richard?

32
00:07:56,951 --> 00:08:00,387
I'd love to, but a med tech with
liquor on his breath, I think not.

33
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:03,252
- Thanks.
- So, how areyou?

34
00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:06,225
I'm better than
your heart-pacing gear.

35
00:08:06,293 --> 00:08:09,785
Every time I'm here, it's skewed further
out ofspec. You need a new unit.

36
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,855
I really need a new body.

37
00:08:11,932 --> 00:08:13,866
I'm afraid I can't helpyou
with that.

38
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:16,994
- I'll bring you a new unit tomorrow.
- Okay.

39
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:19,767
- This one'll be stable till then.
- Thankyou, Richard.

40
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,606
- Take it easy.
- I'll take it anyway I can get it.

41
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:27,613
- How's he doing this morning?
- He asked forvodka again.

42
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:30,445
- Give him any?
- No!

43
00:08:30,518 --> 00:08:33,351
- Good morning, Doctor.
- Hi, Richard.

44
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:39,121
Hey, would you look at this!
Peregrine falcon. Am I right?

45
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:42,185
Yep.
He likes cripples.

46
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,199
Yeah, there was a piece about them
in the Times the other day...

47
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:48,201
nesting all over the city.

48
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:51,705
Something to do with architecture
ofall these old buildings.

49
00:08:51,772 --> 00:08:54,536
I thought he liked my company.

50
00:08:58,946 --> 00:09:02,313
They're a little shy.
Don't take it personally, Barry.

51
00:09:02,383 --> 00:09:05,284
- Drink, Doc?
- No, thanks, Thelma, I'm fi ne.

52
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,986
Bed mode.

53
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:19,431
- Got vodka in there?
- No.

54
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,934
You ain't getting any either.

55
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:25,494
All right, I'll letyou guys talk.

56
00:09:27,808 --> 00:09:32,177
So, Linc, you can imagine how much
sleep I've gotten the past few days...

57
00:09:32,246 --> 00:09:33,679
considering your request.

58
00:09:33,747 --> 00:09:37,911
That's funny. Since I made my decision,
I've been sleeping like a baby.

59
00:09:37,985 --> 00:09:41,421
After all you have survived,
beat all the odds...

60
00:09:41,489 --> 00:09:44,049
you know as well as I do, there's work
on nerve regeneration every day.

61
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:49,722
One fi nger, two shoulders and a brain.
That's all I have, Barry.

62
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,930
These dysreflexia seizures
are occurring more frequently.

63
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:58,165
Build-up offluid in my spine
is a degenerative condition.

64
00:09:58,239 --> 00:10:03,142
We both know I'm waiting for the seizure
that's gonna make me a vegetable.

65
00:10:04,378 --> 00:10:06,812
I don't wanna be a vegetable, Barry.

66
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:12,780
I wanna make the fi nal transition
on my own terms.

67
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:17,156
I'll get it done
with orwithoutyou.

68
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,425
Oh, yeah,
I supposeyou would.

69
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:29,494
So?

70
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,801
- Okay.
- Okaywhat?

71
00:10:39,914 --> 00:10:42,178
Okay, I'll assistyou...

72
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:44,308
in your fi nal transition.

73
00:10:44,385 --> 00:10:47,377
- What about today?
- Linc, preparations have to be made.

74
00:10:47,454 --> 00:10:49,046
This is not a flu shot.

75
00:10:49,123 --> 00:10:51,591
My business is in order.
My bags are packed.

76
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:56,187
Besides, I've got a medical conference
to go to. I've got a plane to catch.

77
00:10:56,263 --> 00:10:58,197
You're lying.

78
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:00,261
When doyou get back?

79
00:11:01,902 --> 00:11:03,062
Sunday.

80
00:11:03,137 --> 00:11:06,664
Okay. Sunday.

81
00:11:10,077 --> 00:11:13,774
- I'll seeyou then.
- Get out beforeyou changeyour mind.

82
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,677
Don't bother to get up.
I'll show myselfout.

83
00:11:18,752 --> 00:11:21,118
Yeah, I'll raceyou to the door.

84
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:27,892
You are...

85
00:11:27,962 --> 00:11:30,396
a very good friend.

86
00:12:20,848 --> 00:12:21,940
Amelia.

87
00:12:23,584 --> 00:12:27,782
- Hey.
- Hey. Morning.

88
00:12:28,756 --> 00:12:30,189
You okay?

89
00:12:30,257 --> 00:12:33,192
Yeah, I'm fi ne.
I just couldn't sleep.

90
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:40,027
- What time is it?
- It's early.

91
00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:51,407
I'm gonna be late forwork.
I gotta shower.

92
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:54,879
- No, you don't. Stay here.
- I gotta go.

93
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:12,127
- Hey, I'll make breakfast?
- No, thanks, I'm gonna be late.

94
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:15,168
Another
slam-bam-thank-you-ma'am, huh?

95
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:20,036
Look--

96
00:13:20,974 --> 00:13:22,908
My therapist tells me...

97
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:25,137
I might not be getting what I need
out ofthis relationship.

98
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:30,650
What are we doing here?
I thinkwe make a great couple.

99
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:36,082
You know where I stand on this.
You know what I want.

100
00:13:36,156 --> 00:13:39,421
Steve, we've been through this.

101
00:13:39,493 --> 00:13:43,930
I care aboutyou. You know that.
I can't make a commitment.

102
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:55,837
Go to work then.

103
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:59,003
Go ahead.
You're gonna be late.

104
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,691
So, Amelia, is it true
you're quitting the cops?

105
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:16,321
- No, transferring to Youth Services.
- You lucky fuck.

106
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,388
You must have one hell
ofa rabbi downtown.

107
00:14:18,465 --> 00:14:20,990
- We're gonna miss you here.
- Three-post-eleven here.

108
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:24,526
- FrightenedchildatAmtraksite.
- I'm a block away. I'll take it.

109
00:14:24,605 --> 00:14:27,369
Some kid found something
over at the tracks.

110
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:30,035
- Finish eating. I'll check it out.
- Seeyou, kid.

111
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,971
Three-post-eleven,
anything furtheron that ten-ten?

112
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,473
Nothing yet.

113
00:15:04,044 --> 00:15:05,511
Wait, I think I see him.

114
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,571
Areyou the one
who called the police?

115
00:15:52,426 --> 00:15:53,859
Wait there, okay?

116
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:03,385
- Areyou out ofyour mind?
- Shut off the engine, all right?

117
00:17:03,463 --> 00:17:05,397
There's been a homicide.
I can't letyou through.

118
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:21,043
- My name is Amelia. What's yours?
- Chris.

119
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:25,813
Chris, hey. I got ajob foryou.
Here's some money.

120
00:17:25,886 --> 00:17:30,220
I need you to buy me one ofthose
cheapo cardboard cameras...

121
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,019
the ones you can throw away.

122
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,855
Okay. Fast as you can.

123
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,196
Three-post-eleven to central.

124
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:36,110
Get Amtrak to send a bus over here.
Get these passengers out ofhere.

125
00:19:37,184 --> 00:19:39,118
Captain Cheney, Detective Solomon.

126
00:19:40,287 --> 00:19:42,983
- Anything else?
- First officer on the scene is there.

127
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:47,186
I found strange stuff near the body. I
collected it before it was washed away.

128
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:53,892
- I also took some pictures.
- Thanks.

129
00:19:53,967 --> 00:19:59,064
- You the one who stopped the train?
- I thought it would disturb evidence.

130
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:03,337
So why not shut down Grand Central while
you're at it, hmm, Patrolman Donahue?

131
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,072
- Is that right?
- Donaghy.

132
00:20:06,146 --> 00:20:08,910
- A rookie, I take it?
- No, sir.

133
00:20:08,982 --> 00:20:11,007
Pretty dumb.

134
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,743
Captain, guess who
the vic turns out to be.

135
00:20:14,821 --> 00:20:17,813
- Talk to me.
- Alan fucking Rubin.

136
00:20:21,995 --> 00:20:25,260
Listen, I don't want anybody
in this area except for the crime unit.

137
00:20:25,332 --> 00:20:27,527
- Okay?
- Okay, Detective.

138
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,836
Knight to H-6. Check.

139
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:44,911
- You got company. Cops.
- Tell 'em I'm busy.

140
00:20:44,985 --> 00:20:48,216
- They said it was urgent.
- Tell 'em I'm out running.

141
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,848
She's too polite for that, Linc.

142
00:20:50,924 --> 00:20:52,858
Hey, looky who's here.

143
00:20:56,296 --> 00:21:00,630
- I got a serious situation.
- It's going around, Paulie.

144
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,634
Chief Murphy sent me.

145
00:21:04,538 --> 00:21:06,699
The good chief.

146
00:21:06,773 --> 00:21:11,176
Hear about the couple at the airport,
got in a taxi yesterday morning?

147
00:21:11,244 --> 00:21:13,235
- Never made it home.
- We don't watch the news anymore.

148
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:16,805
He used to read four papers a day,
tape all the news shows.

149
00:21:16,883 --> 00:21:19,044
Yeah, and now I just hit
the rewind button. A-3.

150
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,415
Things never change.

151
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,480
Yeah, well, that was Alan Rubin
and his wife in that taxi.

152
00:21:25,392 --> 00:21:27,917
Found him dead, buried,
shot in the face...

153
00:21:27,994 --> 00:21:31,987
hand sticking out ofthe ground with his
wife's wedding band on his fi nger...

154
00:21:32,065 --> 00:21:33,896
which was skinned to the bone.

155
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:35,832
She's still missing.

156
00:21:35,902 --> 00:21:37,927
Excuse me whileyou catch up, okay?

157
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:43,442
Don't go too far, Thelma. These nice
gentlemen are leaving in 30 seconds.

158
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,604
Sounds likeyou gotyourself
an open-and-shut there, Paulie.

159
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,272
- I don't think so.
- Yeah?

160
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,441
A man worth millions found dead...

161
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:54,419
with his wife's wedding band
on his mutilated hand.

162
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:56,478
What does that tell you?

163
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:59,150
The doer is saying he's got her.

164
00:21:59,226 --> 00:22:02,320
He's probably contacting the family
right now making a ransom demand.

165
00:22:02,395 --> 00:22:05,796
- I would've been paged ifhe had.
- Checkyour batteries.

166
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,194
It's defi nitely a ransom.

167
00:22:10,136 --> 00:22:12,798
Excuse me, Mr. Rhyme,
Kenneth Solomon.

168
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,637
I've read all your books--
Scene ofthe Crime...

169
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,701
at least a dozen times.

170
00:22:18,778 --> 00:22:20,211
It's great to actually meetyou.

171
00:22:21,848 --> 00:22:25,648
- Where doyou fi nd these guys?
- Theywanna workwith the best.

172
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:30,622
I guess nowyou're gonna ask me to
discuss the crime scene with you, huh?

173
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,215
In fact, we got a bunch
ofphysical evidence...

174
00:22:33,293 --> 00:22:35,727
that doesn't exactly make sense.

175
00:22:35,795 --> 00:22:38,730
Some seriouslyweird stuff.
It's in the report.

176
00:22:41,968 --> 00:22:43,196
You okay?

177
00:22:45,872 --> 00:22:47,567
- You okay?
- Out! Now!

178
00:22:47,641 --> 00:22:51,077
- Anything we can do?
- Asses outta here now!

179
00:22:51,144 --> 00:22:54,375
We're gonna getyou some air.
Come on, breathe for me, Linc.

180
00:22:55,982 --> 00:22:57,574
I said, out!

181
00:22:57,651 --> 00:23:01,678
Come on, deep breaths.
Deep breaths, come on.

182
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:05,657
Deep breaths. I'm getting a B.P. on you.
Come on now, breathe.

183
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:08,592
Look at me. Breathe.

184
00:23:11,064 --> 00:23:13,532
Look at me. Deep breaths.

185
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,160
Come on, come on.
You've got to take this oxygen.

186
00:23:16,236 --> 00:23:18,898
Come on, Rhyme,
staywith me.

187
00:23:18,972 --> 00:23:22,635
Come on, you can do it.
Don't go out on me now.

188
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:24,643
Come on, look at me.

189
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:56,532
You okay?

190
00:23:56,609 --> 00:24:01,069
I would be okay ifyour powers
ofresuscitation were less adept.

191
00:24:02,148 --> 00:24:04,548
Not on my shift, all right.

192
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:07,245
Ifyou have a problem with that,
youjust fi re my ass.

193
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,756
You know I provide generously foryou
in mywill. Keep that in mind.

194
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:15,784
Rhyme, I'm not interested
in having this conversation. Okay?

195
00:24:15,862 --> 00:24:19,958
Okay.
Crime scene report Sellitto left--

196
00:24:20,033 --> 00:24:23,298
would you load those photos
in the viewer for me?

197
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,803
View scan.

198
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,779
Okay, let's take a look
at what we got here.

199
00:24:35,248 --> 00:24:39,116
Where it says location--
Now, what's that?

200
00:24:39,185 --> 00:24:41,745
What's it say about that newspaper?

201
00:24:41,821 --> 00:24:46,849
''Newspaper found beneath a coarse-thread
hex bolt with 4:00 p.m. circled on it.''

202
00:24:46,926 --> 00:24:48,018
4:00 p.m.

203
00:24:49,262 --> 00:24:50,854
Zoom.

204
00:24:55,301 --> 00:24:58,828
What about the little piece ofpaper?
What's the number on it?

205
00:24:58,905 --> 00:25:03,399
- Torn book page with 1 1 9 on it.
- 1 1 9, 4:00 p.m.

206
00:25:11,651 --> 00:25:15,087
- What's today's date?
- Today's November 9.

207
00:25:15,155 --> 00:25:19,251
Phone mode. Sellitto, Paulie.
Call.

208
00:25:23,963 --> 00:25:25,453
What?

209
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:31,360
Sad fact is, a huge percentage
ofinner-city kids...

210
00:25:31,438 --> 00:25:36,603
are having their fi rst drug experiences
at the fifth grade level.

211
00:25:36,676 --> 00:25:41,704
Now, here are some ofthe drugs
they'll most likely be offered.

212
00:25:44,651 --> 00:25:46,278
Marijuana.

213
00:25:46,352 --> 00:25:50,254
Wouldn'tyou like to getyour hands
on that briefcase?

214
00:25:50,323 --> 00:25:53,190
Barbiturates, amphetamines.

215
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,360
Cocaine.

216
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,458
Rock cocaine.

217
00:26:08,074 --> 00:26:11,510
- What is this about?
- Doyou know who Lincoln Rhyme is?

218
00:26:11,578 --> 00:26:13,512
- Textbook guy?
- Yeah.

219
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,311
- What does that have to do with me?
- You'll fi nd out.

220
00:26:20,887 --> 00:26:23,856
Come on in.
They're right in there.

221
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,526
A patrol cop took these pictures?

222
00:26:28,595 --> 00:26:31,530
Yeah, fi rst one on the scene.
It started to rain.

223
00:26:31,598 --> 00:26:32,860
Smart guy.

224
00:26:32,932 --> 00:26:36,368
Also had the balls to stop an Amtrak
from running over the crime scene.

225
00:26:36,436 --> 00:26:39,030
Here she is now.
Officer Donahoe...

226
00:26:39,105 --> 00:26:41,198
meet Lincoln Rhyme.

227
00:26:41,274 --> 00:26:42,707
Donaghy.

228
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,678
You took some terrific
photographs, Officer.

229
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,118
- You know who I am?
- I read your manual at the academy.

230
00:26:54,854 --> 00:26:58,187
- What'd you think ofit?
- I'm not a book critic, sir.

231
00:26:59,092 --> 00:27:02,084
- Butyou found it useful?
- Yeah, I guess so.

232
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,596
Guess so? Sure, you did.
You stopped that train.

233
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,598
Photos you took.

234
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,932
I'd sayyou have a natural instinct
for forensics.

235
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,938
So what do we got, Paulie?

236
00:27:14,974 --> 00:27:18,535
We have footprints, size ten,
thanks to Officer Donaghy...

237
00:27:18,611 --> 00:27:21,136
using a dollar bill
to establish scale.

238
00:27:21,214 --> 00:27:24,149
We have asbestos on the track bed
where there shouldn't be any...

239
00:27:24,217 --> 00:27:27,744
and an iron bolt holding down
a piece ofpaper...

240
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,948
with a book page with 1 1 9
written on it.

241
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,925
Decaying oxidation on the bolt's head,
but not on the thread...

242
00:27:33,993 --> 00:27:37,861
which says to me that someone
removed it from somewhere else...

243
00:27:37,931 --> 00:27:39,364
and placed it there recently.

244
00:27:39,432 --> 00:27:42,595
Wouldn'tyou agree, Officer?

245
00:27:48,308 --> 00:27:51,277
Paulie, I'm convinced
that this crime scene was staged.

246
00:27:51,344 --> 00:27:54,142
- Perp's trying to tell us something.
- What the fuckyou saying?

247
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:57,308
Book page 1 1 9.
1 1 /9-- That's today date.

248
00:27:57,383 --> 00:28:00,978
- Newspaper, 4:00 p.m. What time is it?
- 1 2:1 5.

249
00:28:02,522 --> 00:28:03,784
She's alive.

250
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:07,314
- And he's gonna kill her at 4:00.
- P.m.

251
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,424
We haveyour interestyet, Officer?

252
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:19,201
- I wantyou to work the case with us.
- It's not my area.

253
00:28:20,106 --> 00:28:22,506
Areyou being modest...

254
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:25,135
or areyou a little uneasy
about doing some real police work?

255
00:28:26,813 --> 00:28:30,112
- Excuse me?
- What departmentyou work in, Officer?

256
00:28:30,183 --> 00:28:33,619
Youth Services Division.
I picked her up at orientation.

257
00:28:33,686 --> 00:28:35,278
I see, youth services.

258
00:28:35,355 --> 00:28:38,483
I waited over a year to get that
transfer. I'm not gonnajeopardize--

259
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:42,892
Jeopardize what? Cushy deskjob?

260
00:28:42,962 --> 00:28:45,556
- Forensics is not my area.
- I disagree with you.

261
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:48,324
You can't force me
to take this assignment.

262
00:28:51,504 --> 00:28:52,664
I can.

263
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:57,141
- And ifI refuse?
- You'd putyour career at risk.

264
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:00,407
You think, because ofyour condition,
you can push people around?

265
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,573
I'm sorry.
That is truly pathetic.

266
00:29:03,983 --> 00:29:05,780
- Truly?
- Yeah, damn right.

267
00:29:07,253 --> 00:29:10,313
Well, forgive me, truly...

268
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:13,985
ifI insist on having someone with
your brains and a fresh pair ofeyes.

269
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,188
There's a life
at stake here, Officer.

270
00:29:18,097 --> 00:29:20,930
We're gonna need some key people
and tech support.

271
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,264
- I know the guy.
- Okay.

272
00:29:24,037 --> 00:29:26,528
What the hell areyou smiling at?

273
00:29:36,182 --> 00:29:40,676
Pull up a chair. Tell me everything
you know about the crime scene.

274
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:45,086
- You saw my report.
- I read your report.

275
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,092
I wanna know whatyou felt.

276
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,295
Whatyou feel...

277
00:29:50,363 --> 00:29:52,627
in the deepest recesses
ofyour senses.

278
00:29:52,699 --> 00:29:56,430
You are in love with the sound
ofyour own voice, aren'tyou?

279
00:29:56,502 --> 00:29:59,767
It's yourvoice I yearn to hear.
Pull up a chair. I won't biteyou.

280
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,527
The rifling on the .38 slug
they dug out ofthe victim...

281
00:30:31,604 --> 00:30:35,062
is consistent with a Webley, a very
old, turn-of-the-century handgun.

282
00:30:35,141 --> 00:30:37,609
Thankyou, Kenny.
On the big board, please.

283
00:30:37,677 --> 00:30:41,670
- What doyou got on that bolt?
- Three initials on the head: N.S.G.

284
00:30:41,748 --> 00:30:44,649
And the bolt's not steel,
it's iron.

285
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,981
Iron? Iron.

286
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:50,750
Making it old-- like the Webley.

287
00:30:50,823 --> 00:30:54,281
Officer Donaghy,
what doyou know about asbestos?

288
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,523
- It kills hard-working Americans daily.
- Very good.

289
00:30:57,597 --> 00:30:59,758
- You computer literate?
- A little.

290
00:31:02,502 --> 00:31:04,800
- Where's myThelma?
- Guess.

291
00:31:05,872 --> 00:31:07,999
Thelma, meet Amelia.
Amelia, Thelma.

292
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:12,306
Amelia hates my books and computers, but
she's got an A-plus nose for evidence...

293
00:31:12,378 --> 00:31:16,872
so I wantyou to give her a crash course
in how to access D.E.P. fi les.

294
00:31:16,949 --> 00:31:21,181
Check ifthere's any large asbestos
cleanups going on in the city.

295
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,448
A.S.A.P.

296
00:31:24,223 --> 00:31:27,249
- Where the hell is Eddie Ortiz?
- I'm right here!

297
00:31:29,896 --> 00:31:32,296
How's the world's
crankiest criminalist doing?

298
00:31:32,365 --> 00:31:33,957
Playing beat the clock.

299
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:35,933
Everybody's worst nightmare.

300
00:31:36,002 --> 00:31:39,494
You get into a cab, and there's
a psycho fromJersey driving.

301
00:31:39,572 --> 00:31:41,506
We don't know he's fromJersey.

302
00:31:41,574 --> 00:31:44,737
Yeah, Bayonne. It's the toxins
in the water over there.

303
00:31:44,811 --> 00:31:48,178
- What'd you do, bring the whole lab?
- Mama always said be prepared.

304
00:31:48,247 --> 00:31:50,909
- Where doyou want this?
-Just put it in the corner.

305
00:31:50,983 --> 00:31:52,951
How is your mother?

306
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:56,853
She's 76, and she's schtupping some guy
named Morris. Can you believe it?

307
00:31:56,923 --> 00:32:00,415
- God bless her.
- It's Morris I'm worried about.

308
00:32:00,493 --> 00:32:03,951
He's 79, with a tricky ticker
and an active pecker.

309
00:32:12,004 --> 00:32:14,199
Afternoon.
Captain Cheney.

310
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:16,332
What's your address?

311
00:32:16,409 --> 00:32:18,877
There's about a dozen cleanups
scattered across the five boroughs.

312
00:32:18,945 --> 00:32:20,970
Put it up on the viewer for me,
will you, please?

313
00:32:21,047 --> 00:32:23,982
Narrow it down to the oldest location
as soon as you can.

314
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,109
- Howyou doing, Howard?
- Fine, thankyou.

315
00:32:26,185 --> 00:32:29,279
- How's it going?
- Middle ofthe middle, as you can see.

316
00:32:29,355 --> 00:32:33,587
Hey, Linc, lookwhat I found
on the threading ofthat iron bolt.

317
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,629
Look, I was hoping
to grab a minute with you.

318
00:32:37,697 --> 00:32:39,790
- Ifyou don't mind.
- Excuse me, Howard.

319
00:32:39,866 --> 00:32:41,527
Sorry.

320
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:46,061
We got Officer Donaghy to thank here
for photographing the crucial evidence.

321
00:32:46,138 --> 00:32:49,369
Crucial evidence?
We don't know that.

322
00:32:49,442 --> 00:32:53,071
I just stopped by to make sure
you had all the supportyou need.

323
00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:57,707
I'm putting the full resources
ofmy department here atyour disposal.

324
00:32:57,783 --> 00:33:00,149
And I appreciate it, Howie,
thankyou.

325
00:33:00,219 --> 00:33:02,153
But the thing is, Linc...

326
00:33:02,221 --> 00:33:06,988
I've formalized department standard
procedure sinceyou were in charge...

327
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:09,584
Eddie, could you put whatyou got
up on my screen, please?

328
00:33:09,662 --> 00:33:13,223
so I'd appreciate it
ifyou kept me in the loop.

329
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:14,391
Absolutely.

330
00:33:15,268 --> 00:33:16,997
At all times.

331
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:20,800
At all-- Eddie, what the hell
is that we're looking at?

332
00:33:23,709 --> 00:33:25,267
Old paper.

333
00:33:25,344 --> 00:33:27,471
Coarse grade.

334
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:31,176
I say, 80, 90 years old.

335
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,411
Turn ofthe century,
it looks like.

336
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,581
This perp likes old.

337
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:43,356
- I'll be in my office ifyou need me.
- Yeah, okay.

338
00:33:44,096 --> 00:33:45,427
Good.

339
00:33:48,801 --> 00:33:50,234
Old paper.

340
00:33:51,304 --> 00:33:52,771
Old gun.

341
00:33:55,508 --> 00:33:58,636
Buried his victim in a vintage
Civil War railroad bed.

342
00:33:59,979 --> 00:34:01,412
Sand.

343
00:34:03,683 --> 00:34:05,708
Eddie, what doyou got
on the sand?

344
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:10,316
Doesn't really look like sand.

345
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:13,483
- I'm not sure.
- Can you individuate it?

346
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:18,121
- IfI had E.D.X., I could do anything.
- We don't have that, Eddie.

347
00:34:18,197 --> 00:34:22,190
Lookwho forgot their chill pill
this morning. Excuse me.

348
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:25,362
Come on, I'm all over
this thing now.

349
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:29,397
We're talking pearly looking.

350
00:34:30,142 --> 00:34:34,977
Some kind ofshellfish or something.

351
00:34:37,016 --> 00:34:38,574
Oysters shells, maybe?

352
00:34:40,353 --> 00:34:42,082
Could be.

353
00:34:43,422 --> 00:34:47,017
Defi nitely. IfI had to bet on it,
I'd say it was. Sure.

354
00:34:50,062 --> 00:34:52,053
I got it. The oldest asbestos sites
are coming up now.

355
00:35:23,195 --> 00:35:27,859
In 1 91 3, when the Woolworth Building
was being built...

356
00:35:27,933 --> 00:35:31,494
workmen found the body ofthis rich
industrialist, Talbot Soames.

357
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,936
He'd been kidnapped theyear before,
shot in the head and buried...

358
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:38,875
in what they thought was white sand
but turned out to be oyster shells.

359
00:35:38,944 --> 00:35:43,540
Crushed oyster shells-- That's what they
used as landfi ll in lower Manhattan.

360
00:35:43,616 --> 00:35:46,585
That's how Pearl Street got its name.
That's where Ms. Rubin is gonna be--

361
00:35:46,652 --> 00:35:48,745
somewhere downtown.

362
00:35:48,821 --> 00:35:51,255
She's gonna be underground.

363
00:35:51,323 --> 00:35:53,791
She's gonna be in a basement...

364
00:35:53,859 --> 00:35:56,487
near or in the Woolworth Building.

365
00:35:56,562 --> 00:36:01,761
Paulie, call Emergency Services Unit
to meet us at the Woolworth Building.

366
00:36:01,834 --> 00:36:03,768
Tell them to start their search.
Maybe we'll get lucky.

367
00:36:03,836 --> 00:36:06,100
Okay? Eddie,
did you bring yourvan?

368
00:36:06,172 --> 00:36:08,140
- It's downstairs.
- We're gonna need it.

369
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:11,335
Throwyour keys to Amelia.
Paulie, you and Solomon go with her.

370
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:15,141
- Shouldn't I go too?
- You stay. We're gonna work that bolt.

371
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:18,445
- That's the missing piece.
- Should we keep Cheney in the loop?

372
00:36:18,517 --> 00:36:19,779
Fuck him.

373
00:36:26,792 --> 00:36:28,623
Just trust me.

374
00:36:28,694 --> 00:36:33,393
Just follow those instincts
you were born with. I'll be with you...

375
00:36:33,466 --> 00:36:35,434
every step ofthe way.

376
00:36:46,011 --> 00:36:47,945
Jesus, 25 minutes left.

377
00:36:49,515 --> 00:36:54,043
- How did Rhyme get to be that way?
- He was born brilliant. It happens.

378
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,054
I mean the physical part.

379
00:36:57,389 --> 00:37:00,085
About fouryears ago, he was working
the body ofa transit cop...

380
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:02,423
found shot in a subway tunnel.

381
00:37:03,629 --> 00:37:06,063
Beam came down
and damn near cut him in half.

382
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:08,566
Jesus.

383
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:13,797
- Family?
- Married sister in Phoenix.

384
00:37:13,873 --> 00:37:17,172
He never sees her.
Cut himselfoff.

385
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:21,107
Technically, he's still active duty
collecting full pay.

386
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,206
P.B.A. insurance picks up
round-the-clock care and the gadgets.

387
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:27,650
On weekends, always one or two cops
there, lending a hand.

388
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,951
- Tough deal winding up like that.
- You won't hear him complain about it.

389
00:37:31,023 --> 00:37:33,218
He gets too much pleasure
pushing other people's buttons.

390
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,886
In your case,
I'd be complimented.

391
00:37:35,961 --> 00:37:38,259
You gotta learn to relax
around a compliment...

392
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,195
especially one from Rhyme.

393
00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:42,757
- You can be a little grating.
- Me?

394
00:37:42,835 --> 00:37:46,271
Kiddo, ifyou were any more wound up,
you'd be a Timex.

395
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:55,571
He was a human dynamo. Writing books,
lecturing all over the world...

396
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,843
giving expert opinion in trials...

397
00:37:57,917 --> 00:37:59,976
working halfthe crimes scenes
in the city.

398
00:38:00,052 --> 00:38:03,453
- You know what he did on his downtime?
- I can't imagine.

399
00:38:03,522 --> 00:38:06,616
He'd collect things--
dirt, metals, plastics...

400
00:38:06,692 --> 00:38:09,957
hubcaps, plants, musical strings...

401
00:38:10,029 --> 00:38:12,190
medical tools--
anything you could think of.

402
00:38:12,264 --> 00:38:13,526
Obsessive.

403
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,695
He'd have it all analyzed
and catalogued for his database.

404
00:38:19,605 --> 00:38:23,234
Jesus Christ! I'd like to get there
in one piece, ifpossible.

405
00:38:50,169 --> 00:38:52,103
Yeah, fi nd out about that.
That might be good. What else?

406
00:38:52,171 --> 00:38:54,469
Nicholas Steven Gerard,
elevator construction.

407
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,236
- Gotta be underground.
- I got a subway builder here.

408
00:38:57,309 --> 00:39:01,746
- Subway builder's out.
- N.S.G.-- Niagara Steam Generation.

409
00:39:01,814 --> 00:39:04,942
Bought by Eastern Gas and Electric
in 1 928.

410
00:39:05,017 --> 00:39:09,215
The six-inch iron bolt was used
mainly for steam pipe assemblies.

411
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:58,032
Forty-five, yougot 1 1 minutes left.
Where thehellareyou?

412
00:39:58,103 --> 00:40:00,901
Wejusthit the financialdistrict.

413
00:40:00,973 --> 00:40:05,637
There's a steam junction
with big asbestos-coated pipes.

414
00:40:05,711 --> 00:40:10,580
That's where ourvictim's gonna be.
I bet my legs on it-- Wall and Nassau.

415
00:40:12,818 --> 00:40:14,752
Has E.S.U. been notified?

416
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,615
Yeah, they're on their way.

417
00:40:16,689 --> 00:40:20,955
E.S.U. says that steam is released
through thatjunction every day at 4:00.

418
00:40:21,026 --> 00:40:23,824
Shit, what's this asshole up to?

419
00:40:23,896 --> 00:40:26,990
Idon'tknow, butit's gonnahappen
in about tenminutes and30seconds.

420
00:40:28,434 --> 00:40:30,459
All right, Linc, we're here.
We're going down there.

421
00:40:37,176 --> 00:40:38,370
Yeah, I'm here.

422
00:40:38,444 --> 00:40:40,969
It's theirjob to try
and save Mrs. Rubin's life.

423
00:40:41,046 --> 00:40:45,449
It's yourjob to get ready
and work the crime scene ifnecessary.

424
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:50,150
There's some thingsyou're gonnaneed,
solookin theback ofthe truck.

425
00:40:50,222 --> 00:40:55,785
You'll see an aluminum suitcase
and a radio headset.

426
00:40:56,762 --> 00:40:59,663
- See it?
- Yeah, Isee them.

427
00:41:21,253 --> 00:41:23,187
There must be a way in.

428
00:41:24,923 --> 00:41:28,415
- What's the problem here?
- Fucking valves freeze up easy.

429
00:41:29,161 --> 00:41:30,685
Come on, guys, shut it off.

430
00:41:30,763 --> 00:41:33,391
- You there?
- I'm here.

431
00:41:34,466 --> 00:41:36,900
- I'm inside the pipe.
- One, two, three.

432
00:41:42,174 --> 00:41:43,607
Go!

433
00:41:45,778 --> 00:41:49,509
I think I hear something.
I hear something.

434
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:52,744
Whatis it?Someone's in there!
Icanhearhercrying.

435
00:41:53,585 --> 00:41:55,519
Everyone, quiet now.

436
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:07,455
Mrs. Rubin?

437
00:42:16,241 --> 00:42:18,937
She's in there.
Mrs. Rubin!

438
00:42:19,011 --> 00:42:22,777
We're on ourway in now.
Come on, guys.

439
00:42:22,848 --> 00:42:26,113
Let's go.
Let's hurry the fuck up!

440
00:42:26,185 --> 00:42:29,154
-Jesus Christ.
- Get a drill and a tap.

441
00:42:29,221 --> 00:42:31,280
Somebody cut this thing
halfway through.

442
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,320
Let's dig!

443
00:42:56,982 --> 00:42:58,506
Move back!

444
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,152
Linc, she's gone.

445
00:43:44,229 --> 00:43:47,027
The wholeplaceis scaldedin steam.

446
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:47,199
Let's go. Move away.

447
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:48,962
Let's go. Move away.

448
00:43:49,034 --> 00:43:50,467
Nothing to see here.

449
00:43:50,536 --> 00:43:54,233
E.S.U. are gonna blow a hole in the
subbasement wall. No otherway in.

450
00:43:54,306 --> 00:43:58,402
I am working with Chief Murphy's
authorization on this, right?

451
00:43:58,477 --> 00:44:02,174
- Yeah, that's right.
- Idon't wantE.S. U. guys...

452
00:44:02,247 --> 00:44:06,047
rushing in there, trampling the evidence
before we geta chance torun thescene.

453
00:44:06,118 --> 00:44:10,179
- Whatdoyou want?
- I want Donaghy to go in fi rst.

454
00:44:10,255 --> 00:44:12,985
Come on, Linc,
she's not trained for this.

455
00:44:13,058 --> 00:44:14,992
We can get our asses in a sling.

456
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,722
Myass has beenin asling
forfouryears.

457
00:44:17,796 --> 00:44:21,027
Tell Hanson and his beasts
that's what I want. Period.

458
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:23,033
All right, you got it.

459
00:44:31,143 --> 00:44:33,270
Okay, let's move!

460
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:45,220
I'm doing this under protest.

461
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:47,258
The perp could still be in there.

462
00:44:47,326 --> 00:44:50,159
Rhyme's in charge,
and they're his orders.

463
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:53,687
You can't handle it in there,
I wantyou to getyour ass out.

464
00:44:53,765 --> 00:44:56,233
- Amelia, youready?
- Yeah.

465
00:44:56,301 --> 00:44:58,235
You listen to me.

466
00:44:59,304 --> 00:45:01,772
I'm with you every step ofthe way.

467
00:45:03,008 --> 00:45:04,270
Go on.

468
00:45:04,343 --> 00:45:06,277
Good luck.

469
00:45:17,389 --> 00:45:20,290
- I'm in.
- Tell me whatyou see.

470
00:45:26,732 --> 00:45:30,725
Everything's beenboiledtohell.

471
00:45:35,207 --> 00:45:36,640
Oh, God.

472
00:45:36,708 --> 00:45:38,801
Whatis it?

473
00:45:38,877 --> 00:45:41,744
It's an awful smell.

474
00:45:41,813 --> 00:45:43,610
That means you're close.

475
00:46:07,406 --> 00:46:10,807
- I can't believe I'm doing this.
- You're fine.

476
00:46:10,876 --> 00:46:15,677
Just fi ne. You're doing great.
Just remember the academy.

477
00:46:15,747 --> 00:46:19,148
When you walk,
move in a straight line.

478
00:46:19,217 --> 00:46:22,015
We don't want to disturb
any footprints hemight've left.

479
00:46:22,087 --> 00:46:24,021
Yes, assuming he's gone.

480
00:46:32,064 --> 00:46:36,194
There's no footprints.
There's nothingyet.

481
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:53,475
Oh, God.

482
00:46:53,552 --> 00:46:55,019
What?

483
00:46:55,087 --> 00:46:57,021
Talk tome.

484
00:47:00,826 --> 00:47:03,260
I can see her.

485
00:47:08,333 --> 00:47:13,361
The steam pipe was opened, and she's
tied down right in front ofit.

486
00:47:13,438 --> 00:47:16,532
Okay. There's nothing
you can do about that now.

487
00:47:16,608 --> 00:47:20,840
Can't do anything but help her
byworking the crime scene.

488
00:47:20,912 --> 00:47:22,174
That's yourjob.

489
00:47:22,247 --> 00:47:25,182
Openyoursuitcase,
getyour camera.

490
00:48:08,794 --> 00:48:10,056
I can't do this.

491
00:48:10,128 --> 00:48:13,757
You can do it. Yes, you can.
Yesterdayyou stopped a train.

492
00:48:13,832 --> 00:48:16,460
You can do anything you want
when you putyour mind to it.

493
00:48:16,535 --> 00:48:18,969
Don't work me, Rhyme.

494
00:48:24,976 --> 00:48:30,175
- Just tellme what to do next.
- Very slowly, walk the grid...

495
00:48:30,248 --> 00:48:32,682
one footin frontofthe other.

496
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:41,190
I wantyou tolookaroundyounow.
Remember...

497
00:48:41,259 --> 00:48:45,252
crime scenes are three-dimensional--
floors, walls and ceilings.

498
00:48:53,905 --> 00:48:55,839
Yeah, I'm here.

499
00:48:57,242 --> 00:48:59,176
There's something strange.

500
00:49:00,011 --> 00:49:01,945
Things heleftforus?

501
00:49:07,118 --> 00:49:08,449
Yes.

502
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,388
- In a clusteragain?
- There's asmallpiece ofwood...

503
00:49:12,457 --> 00:49:14,982
anditlooks likesomehair.

504
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:17,392
I'm gonna walkyou through
collecting the evidence.

505
00:49:17,462 --> 00:49:19,692
You do everything
exactly as I say.

506
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,375
- Oh,Jesus.
- Talk tome.

507
00:49:34,446 --> 00:49:36,971
- It's a bloody bone.
- Where is it?

508
00:49:38,984 --> 00:49:41,680
It's in my fucking hand.

509
00:49:41,753 --> 00:49:43,243
Human?

510
00:49:46,391 --> 00:49:48,188
I think so, yeah.

511
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,160
Photograph it...

512
00:49:50,228 --> 00:49:52,719
bag it.

513
00:50:09,581 --> 00:50:13,017
Okay, that's it.
I'm outta here.

514
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:16,417
Onemore thing.

515
00:50:16,488 --> 00:50:18,888
We gotta process the body.

516
00:50:20,959 --> 00:50:22,984
What?I'm nomedicalexaminer.
Ican'tdo that.

517
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,619
I'm notaskingyou to do anautopsy.

518
00:50:24,696 --> 00:50:29,360
I just wantyou to--
Just describe the restraints.

519
00:50:43,214 --> 00:50:45,307
They're strange-looking handcuffs.

520
00:50:45,383 --> 00:50:47,817
They look more like
old shackles or something.

521
00:50:52,324 --> 00:50:55,122
Andthere's a chain
across her waist.

522
00:50:55,193 --> 00:50:57,252
And her feet are...

523
00:50:57,329 --> 00:50:59,263
bound with a rope.

524
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,834
Hands above herhead?

525
00:51:04,769 --> 00:51:06,202
Yeah.

526
00:51:10,208 --> 00:51:14,645
There's also a large piece offlesh
missing from her right forearm.

527
00:51:16,348 --> 00:51:19,909
It's right down to the bone,
like it was surgically removed.

528
00:51:21,419 --> 00:51:22,943
This is what I wantyou to do.

529
00:51:23,021 --> 00:51:25,854
We're gonna need those handcuffs.

530
00:51:25,924 --> 00:51:29,451
It'sprobably ourbestchance
forgoodprints.

531
00:51:29,527 --> 00:51:31,586
The M.E. can remove them
when they get here.

532
00:51:31,663 --> 00:51:35,690
The M.E. is all thumbs.
They'll mess up the prints.

533
00:51:35,767 --> 00:51:39,362
Look in the suitcase.
There's a small saw.

534
00:51:48,013 --> 00:51:49,446
Okay.

535
00:51:49,514 --> 00:51:52,847
I wantyou to saw her hands off
at the wrist line.

536
00:51:52,917 --> 00:51:56,444
We gotta have those cuffs
forprints.

537
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:20,370
I can't.

538
00:52:20,445 --> 00:52:23,380
Cut her hands off.
We need the handcuffs.

539
00:52:23,448 --> 00:52:25,143
I can't. No.

540
00:52:25,216 --> 00:52:28,242
Saw off her hands,
take off the cuffs.

541
00:52:30,922 --> 00:52:33,390
Listen to me. Saw off her h--
We need those cuffs.

542
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:34,652
I can't!

543
00:52:34,726 --> 00:52:37,251
- Amelia, we need--
- No, fuckyou!

544
00:52:47,572 --> 00:52:51,702
Ifhe wants that woman's hands cut off,
he can come down and do it himself.

545
00:55:49,053 --> 00:55:50,486
Hello?

546
00:55:51,623 --> 00:55:53,557
Who is it?

547
00:56:26,157 --> 00:56:27,590
Jesus.

548
00:56:49,681 --> 00:56:52,309
- Take it easy.
- Shit, what areyou doing?

549
00:56:53,551 --> 00:56:56,384
- You okay?
- Am I okay? What areyou doing?

550
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:59,355
Rhyme has been trying
to call you for hours.

551
00:56:59,424 --> 00:57:02,154
Your phone's down.
He was concerned.

552
00:57:02,226 --> 00:57:06,629
My phone's fi ne.
I don't need his concern.

553
00:57:06,698 --> 00:57:09,132
He needs you over
at his place right away.

554
00:57:11,202 --> 00:57:14,831
I don't work for Lincoln Rhyme.

555
00:57:14,906 --> 00:57:18,034
Rhyme thinks the evidenceyou collected
indicates there's anothervic in play.

556
00:57:18,109 --> 00:57:21,135
And he's laying that at my feet?

557
00:57:21,212 --> 00:57:23,339
Don't shoot the messenger.

558
00:57:45,303 --> 00:57:49,171
- Youjust move in?
- Yeah, about a year ago.

559
00:57:53,811 --> 00:57:55,244
Really?

560
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:16,527
- You were a model.
- Yeah, when I was a kid.

561
00:58:16,601 --> 00:58:20,401
Kid model to street cop--
there's a leap.

562
00:58:23,641 --> 00:58:25,575
Forwhatever it's worth...

563
00:58:27,478 --> 00:58:29,708
I thought whatyou did today
was pretty damn terrific.

564
00:59:12,723 --> 00:59:14,281
Hey, you guys. I'm outta here.

565
00:59:15,526 --> 00:59:18,086
I'm gonna grab a cab.
I got a paper to fi nish.

566
00:59:18,162 --> 00:59:21,029
- I'm just gonna hang.
- I'll be there in a minute.

567
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:40,712
Taxi!

568
00:59:50,361 --> 00:59:53,228
That bone's defi nitely not human.

569
00:59:53,297 --> 00:59:56,425
- And the hair?
- Not human either.

570
00:59:56,501 --> 00:59:59,937
- Well, what is it?
- Working fast as I can.

571
01:00:02,507 --> 01:00:04,975
Glad to seeyou couldjoin us.

572
01:00:05,042 --> 01:00:08,671
I got Cheney on the line.
He wants you to briefhim.

573
01:00:08,746 --> 01:00:10,680
Tell him I'll call him back.

574
01:00:12,383 --> 01:00:13,816
Two things:

575
01:00:15,386 --> 01:00:17,718
First, you did a hell ofajob
locating the evidence.

576
01:00:17,788 --> 01:00:20,313
There's no question
the perp knows forensics.

577
01:00:21,392 --> 01:00:22,950
Now, as for the other thing...

578
01:00:23,027 --> 01:00:24,289
the--

579
01:00:27,765 --> 01:00:31,667
you know, the victim's hands--
well, maybe--

580
01:00:33,738 --> 01:00:36,036
maybe it was too much to handle,
so we'll just forget it.

581
01:00:37,108 --> 01:00:39,042
Is thatyourversion
ofan apology?

582
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:43,376
An apology?
Is that whyyou came over here?

583
01:00:45,116 --> 01:00:48,574
- You really are a piece ofwork.
- Well, aren't we a pair?

584
01:00:50,888 --> 01:00:53,049
I thinkyou're terrific.

585
01:00:56,727 --> 01:00:58,991
You got a hell ofan arrest record too.

586
01:01:00,064 --> 01:01:04,091
High marks from all your bosses,
defi nite gold shield potential.

587
01:01:04,835 --> 01:01:08,202
Whyyou want to throw it all away
to chaseyouth offenders?

588
01:01:09,507 --> 01:01:11,498
Oh, I don't feel I have any need
to explain that toyou.

589
01:01:11,576 --> 01:01:13,510
Come on, Amelia. Cop to cop.

590
01:01:13,578 --> 01:01:17,378
Cop to cop, let'sjust
leave it at ''personal reasons.''

591
01:01:17,448 --> 01:01:19,814
Okay.

592
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:22,216
Doesn't have anything to do
with your father, does it?

593
01:01:29,794 --> 01:01:31,887
Man, youjust keep
charging at walls, don'tyou?

594
01:01:31,963 --> 01:01:34,022
Stubbornness is something
we both share.

595
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:39,934
They saywe come into this world
with a genetically preordained destiny.

596
01:01:40,004 --> 01:01:41,403
I don't believe it.

597
01:01:41,472 --> 01:01:45,602
For example, neither ofmy parents had
more than an eighth grade education.

598
01:01:45,676 --> 01:01:48,839
Never read more
than one book between them-- not one.

599
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,104
I've read thousands.

600
01:01:51,182 --> 01:01:54,151
- I've written a dozen.
- What's your point?

601
01:01:54,218 --> 01:01:58,552
My point is that destiny is
whatyou make it.

602
01:02:01,225 --> 01:02:04,319
Whatever happened toyour father
doesn't mean it's gonna happen toyou.

603
01:02:04,395 --> 01:02:08,092
You're a great cop.
You'd make a terrific detective.

604
01:02:09,333 --> 01:02:11,824
It's a gift.

605
01:02:12,903 --> 01:02:14,837
Don't throw it away.

606
01:02:21,746 --> 01:02:23,805
Report from the taxi commission.

607
01:02:23,881 --> 01:02:26,315
An NYU student was abducted
late last night.

608
01:02:26,384 --> 01:02:28,318
His girlfriend saw him
struggling to get out...

609
01:02:28,386 --> 01:02:31,981
as the taxi driverwas
bludgeoning him with a flashlight.

610
01:02:32,056 --> 01:02:33,990
No description ofthe driver.

611
01:02:34,058 --> 01:02:36,754
Okay, everybody.
This could be our next victim.

612
01:02:36,827 --> 01:02:39,762
Yeah, Tony. Paulie here.
It looks like we got anothervictim.

613
01:02:42,233 --> 01:02:44,224
Did you get a deadline
off that evidenceyet?

614
01:02:46,337 --> 01:02:49,329
Notyet. Something I was hoping
you'd help me with.

615
01:04:18,028 --> 01:04:20,519
Anyone for some osso buco?

616
01:04:20,598 --> 01:04:22,623
What?

617
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:25,897
The bone we found
at the Wall Street scene--

618
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:27,403
veal shank...

619
01:04:27,471 --> 01:04:29,405
braised and overly salted to boot.

620
01:04:29,473 --> 01:04:31,566
- Cow bone?
- Uh-huh.

621
01:04:31,642 --> 01:04:35,601
And I also found
a piece ofthat old paper...

622
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:37,579
imbedded in the bone.

623
01:04:37,648 --> 01:04:39,240
Take a look.

624
01:04:43,187 --> 01:04:44,814
What's going on here?

625
01:04:44,889 --> 01:04:47,084
Just do whatyou need to do
as quickly as possible, okay, Richard?

626
01:04:47,158 --> 01:04:49,149
It's about the hair follicles.
He says they're not human.

627
01:04:49,226 --> 01:04:51,126
A rodent, probably a rat.

628
01:04:51,195 --> 01:04:52,924
And get this:
Theywere shaved off.

629
01:04:52,997 --> 01:04:55,261
Oh, now we're looking for
a rat that shaves.

630
01:04:55,332 --> 01:04:58,392
- I really like that.
- I've known a few in my time.

631
01:04:58,469 --> 01:05:01,666
- How 'boutyou, Amelia?
- More than a few.

632
01:05:02,406 --> 01:05:05,273
It's consistent with underground,
that's for sure.

633
01:05:05,342 --> 01:05:07,606
What's he trying to say to us?

634
01:05:07,678 --> 01:05:09,407
Defi nitely communicating
in our language...

635
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,744
leaving clues--
forensic clues at that.

636
01:05:11,816 --> 01:05:13,408
Maybe it's a cop.

637
01:05:14,418 --> 01:05:15,680
Maybe.

638
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:19,421
Maybe he's trying to share the
responsibility ofthese murders with us.

639
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:22,618
Ifwe don't figure out the clues
in time, the blood's on our hands.

640
01:05:22,693 --> 01:05:26,789
We don't fi nd the victim in time, we're
as responsible for the murders as he is.

641
01:05:27,531 --> 01:05:29,362
Whatyou got on the dirt
you scraped from the wood, Eddie?

642
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:34,195
I don't have it 1 00% individuated,
but it does appear nitrogen-rich.

643
01:05:34,271 --> 01:05:36,330
- All set, ready to rock and roll.
- All right.

644
01:05:36,407 --> 01:05:38,341
- Thanks for rushing. I appreciate it.
- All right, Thelma.

645
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:40,809
Thankyou, Richard.

646
01:05:40,878 --> 01:05:45,281
Nitrogen rich, explosive carbons--
where doyou fi nd those in New York?

647
01:05:45,349 --> 01:05:48,876
Bomb sites, shooting ranges.

648
01:05:48,953 --> 01:05:51,148
Maybe an old fort or an armory?

649
01:05:51,222 --> 01:05:53,053
Let's not forget
the shit factor, guys.

650
01:05:53,123 --> 01:05:54,454
The what?

651
01:05:55,526 --> 01:05:57,460
Manure becomes a nitrate
when it's aged.

652
01:05:57,528 --> 01:06:00,053
That's true.

653
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:02,064
And you got cow bones, huh?

654
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:07,897
Old cow bones, old manure.
Turn ofthe century, cows, farms...

655
01:06:07,972 --> 01:06:10,805
pastures, rats--

656
01:06:11,609 --> 01:06:13,042
Dead cows.

657
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:16,438
Where doyou fi nd--
In stockyards.

658
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,484
Slaughterhouses,
that's what we want to look for.

659
01:06:20,551 --> 01:06:23,179
Stockyards and slaughterhouses
from the turn ofthe century.

660
01:06:23,254 --> 01:06:25,415
- Let's start there.
- Check the internet.

661
01:06:25,489 --> 01:06:30,392
Okay, I want tax records, sanitation
records and building code inspections...

662
01:06:30,461 --> 01:06:32,395
last hundred years, okay?

663
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:17,598
Man, your blood pressure is
way up.

664
01:07:23,213 --> 01:07:25,147
- You're pushing it too hard, Rhyme.
- I understand, Thelma.

665
01:07:25,215 --> 01:07:27,877
What do we got
on the stockyards over there?

666
01:07:27,952 --> 01:07:30,216
- We're almost there.
- Okay, that one's no good.

667
01:07:30,287 --> 01:07:32,619
- You okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

668
01:07:33,557 --> 01:07:37,254
Can't figure out this damn time line
or these shards ofcardboard.

669
01:07:37,328 --> 01:07:38,795
I don't know what the hell it means.

670
01:07:38,862 --> 01:07:41,092
We got three
defunct stockyards sites.

671
01:07:41,165 --> 01:07:43,759
There's one on the east side,
Lexington and the Harlem Riverviaduct.

672
01:07:43,834 --> 01:07:49,329
Solomon, put the box down, and mark them
on the viewer as she calls them out.

673
01:07:49,406 --> 01:07:52,842
Your blood pressure's gonna
blow a gasket ifyou don't slow down.

674
01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:55,606
My body has a mind ofits own.
It doesn't listen to me.

675
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:56,941
All right?

676
01:07:57,014 --> 01:07:58,606
What else, Amelia?

677
01:07:59,917 --> 01:08:02,351
Yeah, there's another
on the Hudson up at 1 55th.

678
01:08:02,419 --> 01:08:04,080
Mark it down, Solomon.

679
01:08:04,154 --> 01:08:08,318
Look, your stats are going down. You saw
him have a seizure the other day.

680
01:08:08,392 --> 01:08:10,019
What else?

681
01:08:10,094 --> 01:08:11,925
There's one underground
at Greenwich and Houston.

682
01:08:12,663 --> 01:08:15,097
- Mark it down, Solomon.
- Why don'tyou knock it off, Lincoln?

683
01:08:15,165 --> 01:08:17,360
I don't need to knock it off!.

684
01:08:28,112 --> 01:08:30,774
What was the fi rst one
thatyou mentioned?

685
01:08:30,848 --> 01:08:33,180
Lexington and
the Harlem Riverviaduct.

686
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:35,878
- And when did it close?
- 1 91 0.

687
01:08:35,953 --> 01:08:38,945
Okay, what about Houston--
Yeah.

688
01:08:39,023 --> 01:08:41,389
- Houston and Greenwich. When is that?
- 1 898.

689
01:08:41,458 --> 01:08:45,155
And the Hudson and 1 55th was
closed in 1 906.

690
01:08:45,229 --> 01:08:47,094
1 906, 1 898--

691
01:08:50,601 --> 01:08:52,466
All right, let's--
1 898.

692
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:56,706
Houston and Greenwich.
You call emergency services, Paulie.

693
01:08:56,774 --> 01:08:59,299
Tell them...

694
01:08:59,376 --> 01:09:01,310
meet us at Houston and Greenwich,
okay?

695
01:09:01,378 --> 01:09:04,870
Solomon, you get on to Hanson.
He'll need about 20 guys.

696
01:09:04,948 --> 01:09:06,882
We'll take Eddie's van.

697
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:10,078
- You go with them.
- Come on, guys. Let's go!

698
01:09:29,873 --> 01:09:31,397
Linc, areyou there?

699
01:09:32,176 --> 01:09:34,440
- Yeah, ready.
- We're here.

700
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,345
Okay. Amelia?

701
01:09:39,283 --> 01:09:42,946
- Yeah.
- Same drill. I wantyouin first.

702
01:09:45,823 --> 01:09:47,552
Let's do it.

703
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:13,478
Watch yourself, Amelia.

704
01:10:19,723 --> 01:10:21,714
Oh, man, I don't like this.

705
01:10:21,792 --> 01:10:23,692
I don't like this.

706
01:10:27,364 --> 01:10:29,559
Hey, Linc, I got a bad feeling
about this, man.

707
01:10:30,467 --> 01:10:32,867
I thinkall three ofus ought to
getin there together.

708
01:10:32,936 --> 01:10:34,767
Notyet, Paulie.
Just hold back.

709
01:10:41,678 --> 01:10:43,612
Going down somestairs.

710
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:47,612
Cement walls.

711
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:55,819
Wood crates...

712
01:10:55,893 --> 01:10:57,451
large columns.

713
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:02,262
Smells likemanure down here.

714
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,661
Ortizsure knows his shit.

715
01:11:06,036 --> 01:11:08,027
Always has.

716
01:11:09,773 --> 01:11:12,833
Metal hooks...

717
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:14,502
and a pen.

718
01:11:15,345 --> 01:11:16,937
It's a slaughterhouse.

719
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:37,759
- E.S. U. are here.
- Hold them off.

720
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:39,996
Don't let them in there
and contaminate the scene.

721
01:11:41,772 --> 01:11:44,172
All right, hold it.
Hold up. Hold up!

722
01:11:44,241 --> 01:11:45,902
- You're not to go in.
- Why?

723
01:11:45,976 --> 01:11:49,309
- Rhyme's orders.
- Fuck him. Get me Cheney on the line.

724
01:11:50,047 --> 01:11:51,810
Crimescene C. O. onair.

725
01:11:52,549 --> 01:11:54,346
Switch to channel22 forE.S. U.

726
01:11:54,418 --> 01:11:56,249
Fuck Rhyme.

727
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:08,525
Maybe this one's still alive.

728
01:12:08,599 --> 01:12:10,931
Perp didn't leave a deadline.

729
01:12:11,001 --> 01:12:12,866
Whatdoes thatmean?

730
01:12:13,937 --> 01:12:15,666
It means we're probably too late.

731
01:12:15,739 --> 01:12:17,434
You don't know that, Rhyme.

732
01:12:17,507 --> 01:12:19,270
Get off the line.

733
01:12:20,944 --> 01:12:22,434
Let's move on, Amelia.

734
01:12:25,515 --> 01:12:29,281
You know, there's five basic
contaminants to every crime scene.

735
01:12:29,353 --> 01:12:31,014
I'll skip to the worst one.

736
01:12:31,088 --> 01:12:33,022
Othercops.

737
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:41,791
I think I hear something.

738
01:12:46,136 --> 01:12:47,501
I hate this shit.

739
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,648
Iseesomething.
Something's there.

740
01:13:18,302 --> 01:13:19,735
I think Ifoundhim.

741
01:13:19,803 --> 01:13:22,636
Ican't--
Ican't tellifhe's alive.

742
01:13:26,376 --> 01:13:29,140
Oh,Jesus.
He's covered in rats.

743
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,745
They're all overhim.

744
01:13:42,359 --> 01:13:44,919
- We're going in.
- No, you're not!

745
01:13:51,368 --> 01:13:52,835
Go, go!

746
01:13:52,903 --> 01:13:55,667
Central, we have shots fired.
Shots fired.

747
01:14:04,681 --> 01:14:06,512
Oh, God.

748
01:14:12,723 --> 01:14:15,954
You were right.
We neverhadashot.

749
01:14:17,194 --> 01:14:20,561
He cut him up pretty bad
and left him for the rats.

750
01:14:22,132 --> 01:14:24,464
There's also a big cut in his leg,
it's right down to the bone.

751
01:14:25,769 --> 01:14:28,135
Thebloodattractedtherats.

752
01:14:33,477 --> 01:14:35,638
Goddamn son ofa bitch.

753
01:14:44,488 --> 01:14:45,750
You okay?

754
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:56,162
I'm fi ne.

755
01:14:56,233 --> 01:14:58,098
Wanna step aside
so I can walk the grid?

756
01:15:01,304 --> 01:15:03,238
Yeah.

757
01:15:03,306 --> 01:15:05,900
Yeah, all right, let's back 'em up.
Let's give her some room. Come on.

758
01:15:07,411 --> 01:15:10,380
Rhyme, I'm gonna walk thegrid.

759
01:15:10,447 --> 01:15:11,573
Okay.

760
01:15:12,315 --> 01:15:14,283
You know what to do.

761
01:15:34,871 --> 01:15:36,532
I found it.

762
01:15:36,606 --> 01:15:38,699
Another cluster.

763
01:15:39,576 --> 01:15:41,908
It's apiece ofoldpaper,
justlike the othertwo.

764
01:15:41,978 --> 01:15:43,809
Andamatchbox.

765
01:15:44,548 --> 01:15:47,108
Somebody get that black suitcase
and bring it over here, please.

766
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:52,247
Pull out thebrown envelope.

767
01:15:56,426 --> 01:15:58,826
Sounds likeyou're starting
to enjoy this work.

768
01:16:04,734 --> 01:16:06,759
Damn. The press is here.

769
01:16:10,474 --> 01:16:11,736
Right there.

770
01:16:15,445 --> 01:16:19,211
Lincoln Rhyme is no longerworking
this case. I'm taking over. Understood?

771
01:16:19,282 --> 01:16:23,184
You can do whatyou want, Captain, but
you ought to checkwith Murphy fi rst.

772
01:16:23,253 --> 01:16:25,244
Fuck Murphy, and fuck Rhyme.

773
01:16:25,322 --> 01:16:29,281
This has been cleareddowntown.
We gota deadkidin there on ourhands.

774
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:32,089
And I for one am not taking the heat
for that, you understand?

775
01:16:33,497 --> 01:16:37,092
Call Ortiz. Tell him and his crew
to vacate Rhyme's place now, tonight.

776
01:16:37,167 --> 01:16:39,829
Excuse me, but the victim was
already dead when we arrived.

777
01:16:39,903 --> 01:16:43,339
And you-- half-assed patrolman
working a crime scene--

778
01:16:43,406 --> 01:16:45,340
those days are over.

779
01:16:45,408 --> 01:16:47,535
I'll take that evidence bag now,
thankyou.

780
01:16:47,611 --> 01:16:50,341
You can take it
with a chain ofcustodyvoucher, sir.

781
01:16:53,016 --> 01:16:54,745
Areyou out ofyour mind?

782
01:16:59,055 --> 01:17:01,489
Let's go.
You're coming with us.

783
01:17:01,558 --> 01:17:03,185
What, areyouarresting me?

784
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:06,229
Youjustgetin the car,
andkeepyourmouth shut to thepress.

785
01:17:21,478 --> 01:17:24,504
You're not gonna fi nd any prints.
The guy's too good for that.

786
01:17:32,289 --> 01:17:35,053
Well, it looks like we have
a nice clean friction print here.

787
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,687
Unless, ofcourse, it's yours.

788
01:17:39,763 --> 01:17:42,323
No, I was wearing gloves
when I collected it.

789
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:44,230
We'll know soon enough.

790
01:17:45,302 --> 01:17:46,894
Put this through,
highest priority.

791
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:48,562
- You got it.
- Thankyou.

792
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:03,314
You know, I got a feeling this perp's
been in business for a long time.

793
01:18:03,386 --> 01:18:05,946
Yeah, I hearyou,
but that's Cheney's problem now.

794
01:18:07,324 --> 01:18:09,952
That's what scares me.
Do me a favor, will you?

795
01:18:10,026 --> 01:18:13,018
Check ifthere's been any homicides
in the last 1 2 months...

796
01:18:13,096 --> 01:18:15,860
involving surgically-removed flesh
exposing bone.

797
01:18:18,301 --> 01:18:21,737
No problem.
I'll seeyou soon.

798
01:18:21,805 --> 01:18:23,966
- Hope so, Eddie.
- Hey, Thelma...

799
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,634
don'tyou let him
run no circles around you now.

800
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:27,972
Stay right, Eddie.

801
01:18:46,997 --> 01:18:50,524
Oh, that print--
wejust got a positive I.D. on it.

802
01:18:52,002 --> 01:18:55,096
Guy has three
extremelyviolent priors.

803
01:18:56,172 --> 01:18:59,573
Oh, look at that.
Taxi license, no less.

804
01:18:59,643 --> 01:19:01,110
We got him.

805
01:19:01,177 --> 01:19:03,907
Way to go, boys.
Somebody call the E.S.U.

806
01:19:21,631 --> 01:19:23,292
Now slide out...

807
01:19:23,366 --> 01:19:25,095
nice and easy.

808
01:19:38,014 --> 01:19:39,948
That explains your print, Captain.

809
01:19:42,385 --> 01:19:46,321
He's nowthe fourth victim ofakilling
spree thathaspromptedNYPD brass...

810
01:19:46,389 --> 01:19:49,916
tolaunch aspecialtask force
to track thekiller.

811
01:19:49,993 --> 01:19:55,454
This morning's raidin Queens follows
leads foundatan earliermurdersite.

812
01:19:55,532 --> 01:19:57,329
Detectives at thescene--

813
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:58,765
I was hoping you'd show up.

814
01:20:01,705 --> 01:20:04,401
- He's been worried aboutyou.
- Yeah, sure.

815
01:20:04,474 --> 01:20:07,375
Viewers willknowRhyme
from his book, Scene ofthe Crime...

816
01:20:07,444 --> 01:20:10,106
a chronicle ofoldNew York's
mostgrislymurders...

817
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:12,910
that toppedthebest-sellerlist
earlierthisyear.

818
01:20:12,982 --> 01:20:15,143
Didn't expect to seeyou again.

819
01:20:16,753 --> 01:20:18,414
Poor Cheney, huh?

820
01:20:18,488 --> 01:20:21,013
Grabbed the ball with both hands,
scored one for the other team.

821
01:20:21,091 --> 01:20:23,150
- Ican'treally commentat this time.
- Yeah.

822
01:20:23,226 --> 01:20:26,286
Well, I tried to warn him that the perp
was too smart to leave a print.

823
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:29,298
Howyou doing with that stuff?

824
01:20:30,233 --> 01:20:32,497
Not too good.

825
01:20:32,569 --> 01:20:35,299
Two pieces ofthe puzzle
but I don't know what it means.

826
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:40,366
Maybe this'll help.

827
01:20:41,478 --> 01:20:43,639
Cheneywill haveyour badge
for that.

828
01:20:43,713 --> 01:20:46,375
He wouldn't give me a chain ofcustody
voucher, so what could I do?

829
01:20:46,449 --> 01:20:48,349
You could bring it back to him.

830
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:52,153
The man is a living monument
to ineptitude.

831
01:20:52,222 --> 01:20:54,656
True. Let's take a look.

832
01:20:55,892 --> 01:20:57,757
What doyou got there?

833
01:20:59,863 --> 01:21:01,296
Third piece ofthe puzzle.

834
01:21:01,364 --> 01:21:06,199
There's something really strange
about it though, soyou gotta smell it.

835
01:21:08,772 --> 01:21:10,672
Sure.

836
01:21:11,474 --> 01:21:13,533
- Areyou--
- Oh, shit.

837
01:21:19,315 --> 01:21:20,577
Sorry.

838
01:21:20,650 --> 01:21:22,914
Oh, it's okay.
Takeyour time.

839
01:21:33,663 --> 01:21:36,223
You have to put it closer
to my nose.

840
01:21:40,336 --> 01:21:42,065
What doyou think it is?

841
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:45,202
Kerosene?

842
01:21:48,044 --> 01:21:49,773
Possibly.

843
01:21:49,846 --> 01:21:52,280
Okay, thisjust came in
from Eddie Ortiz.

844
01:21:52,348 --> 01:21:55,442
Amelia, could you load these
into the viewer for me, please?

845
01:21:55,518 --> 01:21:57,110
Sorry about that, Thelma.

846
01:21:58,087 --> 01:22:00,885
E.C.U., view scan.

847
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:06,353
''Dear Linc, I'm enclosing photos
offour unsolved homicides...

848
01:22:06,429 --> 01:22:08,863
which took place in the last 1 2 months.

849
01:22:08,932 --> 01:22:12,459
Flesh has been surgically removed
from each ofthe victims' extremities.

850
01:22:12,535 --> 01:22:14,969
I miss you. Love, Eddie.''

851
01:22:15,038 --> 01:22:17,165
I'm gonna spare myselfthe pleasure,
ifyou don't mind.

852
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:18,832
Okay, Thelma.

853
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:22,543
Zoom.

854
01:22:25,014 --> 01:22:26,982
Same mark.

855
01:22:27,717 --> 01:22:28,945
Right.

856
01:22:29,686 --> 01:22:32,746
Zoom. Zoom.

857
01:22:38,862 --> 01:22:40,591
Same messages.

858
01:22:44,534 --> 01:22:46,058
It's him.

859
01:22:47,237 --> 01:22:49,933
The perp was trying to make contact
even then.

860
01:22:51,741 --> 01:22:53,834
But Cheney never put it together.

861
01:23:00,183 --> 01:23:02,583
Dysreflexia seizure, a bad one.

862
01:23:02,652 --> 01:23:05,177
Hang on, hang on.
Breathe, Rhyme.

863
01:23:05,255 --> 01:23:06,813
Come on. Breathe with me.
Breathe!

864
01:23:06,890 --> 01:23:09,188
The damn catheter's blocked.

865
01:23:09,259 --> 01:23:11,352
Just let me get a B.P. on you.
Staywith me.

866
01:23:11,427 --> 01:23:13,952
Staywith me.
Breathe!

867
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:16,965
Hang on, now. Hang on.
Just let me checkyou.

868
01:23:19,102 --> 01:23:22,503
Diastolic's over 1 25.
I gotta get it down now.

869
01:23:28,878 --> 01:23:31,870
Just give it a few seconds to work.
Come on, breathe with me.

870
01:23:31,948 --> 01:23:33,882
Breathe with me, Rhyme.
Rhyme!

871
01:23:38,521 --> 01:23:39,954
Come on, now.

872
01:23:42,692 --> 01:23:44,182
Hang on, Rhyme.
Hang on, man.

873
01:23:44,928 --> 01:23:47,123
Is he gonna make it?

874
01:23:47,196 --> 01:23:49,130
Ifhe does, he won't be happy.

875
01:23:51,067 --> 01:23:53,058
What areyou talking about?

876
01:23:54,404 --> 01:23:57,237
He's already fi nalized arrangements
to self-terminate.

877
01:24:00,777 --> 01:24:05,805
He's got a doctor friend to help with
his ''fi nal transition,'' as he calls it.

878
01:24:07,283 --> 01:24:08,750
But suicide? I mean--

879
01:24:08,818 --> 01:24:10,513
It's the seizures.

880
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:14,751
Any one ofthem could put him
into a vegetative state.

881
01:24:15,692 --> 01:24:18,058
That's what he fears
more than anything.

882
01:24:22,231 --> 01:24:24,995
- Who is it?
- Captain Cheney.

883
01:24:25,068 --> 01:24:26,660
Whatcan Ihelpyou with?

884
01:24:27,704 --> 01:24:29,399
Police business.
Open up, please.

885
01:24:29,472 --> 01:24:31,565
Mr. Rhyme is asleep.

886
01:24:32,342 --> 01:24:35,175
Well, wake him up.
I need to see him now.

887
01:24:38,081 --> 01:24:40,709
Let me deal with this asshole Cheney.
You watch him.

888
01:24:40,783 --> 01:24:43,274
Anything,just call me.
He's all right.

889
01:24:52,128 --> 01:24:53,720
Look, lady.

890
01:24:53,796 --> 01:24:57,527
Now, I hopeyou know that
obstructingjustice is a felony offense.

891
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:00,569
Look, don't ''lady'' me,
and I know my rights.

892
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:02,537
Now, unless you have a warrant,
you can't come in here.

893
01:25:02,605 --> 01:25:03,867
Oh, I'm coming in...

894
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:08,570
'cause I have reason to believe
there's stolen evidence in there.

895
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:11,239
What's your full name?

896
01:25:11,314 --> 01:25:13,282
Thelma what?

897
01:25:15,952 --> 01:25:18,921
Well, what did you say
your name was?

898
01:25:21,958 --> 01:25:24,984
You got a smart mouth, and it's gonna
getyou in trouble one day.

899
01:25:25,061 --> 01:25:28,895
And it may biteyour ass ifyou don't
stop trying to aggravate my patient.

900
01:25:28,965 --> 01:25:31,900
I'm gonna leave now,
but I'll be back.

901
01:25:31,968 --> 01:25:34,937
And when I come back,
it'll be with a warrant.

902
01:25:50,853 --> 01:25:55,654
And I looked everywhere, and I thought
the conductorwas gonna be so angry.

903
01:25:55,725 --> 01:25:57,989
And I kept on searching everywhere.

904
01:25:58,061 --> 01:26:00,757
And fi nally,
it was right on my lap.

905
01:26:05,635 --> 01:26:07,569
Grandma can't wait to seeyou.

906
01:27:02,625 --> 01:27:04,991
- What'd I do?
- First off...

907
01:27:05,061 --> 01:27:06,722
you're carrying a fare,
and your meter's not on.

908
01:27:06,796 --> 01:27:09,230
And number two, your hack license
is not properly displayed--

909
01:28:13,062 --> 01:28:15,656
There's laws against molesting
the handicapped, you know.

910
01:28:18,301 --> 01:28:19,734
Yeah?

911
01:28:23,973 --> 01:28:26,635
I wasn't a pretty sight,
was I?

912
01:28:31,714 --> 01:28:35,150
Thelma told me aboutyour plans
foryour ''fi nal transition.''

913
01:28:39,922 --> 01:28:43,119
Cop to cop, that subject's
not open to discussion.

914
01:28:45,962 --> 01:28:47,486
Why-- would you miss me?

915
01:28:48,564 --> 01:28:50,930
Well, destiny's what we make it,
right?

916
01:28:53,569 --> 01:28:54,866
Touche.

917
01:28:54,937 --> 01:28:56,336
Now, you seem to haveyour reasons
for checking out.

918
01:28:56,405 --> 01:28:58,396
I just--

919
01:28:58,474 --> 01:29:00,601
I would have expected more
from someone likeyou.

920
01:29:00,676 --> 01:29:02,610
Well, I might surpriseyou and...

921
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:05,642
live forever.

922
01:29:05,715 --> 01:29:08,377
Nothing you could do
would surprise me, Rhyme.

923
01:29:08,451 --> 01:29:11,352
Well, lookwho's still
in the land ofthe living.

924
01:29:12,088 --> 01:29:14,022
For the moment.

925
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:15,887
Cheneywas here,
huffi ng and puffi ng.

926
01:29:15,958 --> 01:29:17,892
Promised to return with a warrant.

927
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,894
Sorry I missed him.

928
01:29:20,963 --> 01:29:22,954
Ifthat's him,
tell him I'm...

929
01:29:23,032 --> 01:29:24,932
- Say no more.
- skiing.

930
01:29:26,035 --> 01:29:27,297
Hello?

931
01:29:27,370 --> 01:29:29,338
Oh, hey, Paulie.
Hang on.

932
01:29:30,406 --> 01:29:30,439
Linc, I don't know ifthis is
anything more than a coincidence...

933
01:29:30,439 --> 01:29:33,033
Linc, I don't know ifthis is
anything more than a coincidence...

934
01:29:33,109 --> 01:29:36,840
but a taxi inspectorwas killed today
by a cabbie who was off the meter.

935
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:39,313
Thing about this taxi--
a witness, a male--

936
01:29:39,382 --> 01:29:40,849
wouldn'tgive his name--

937
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:44,819
sawthe taxispeeding away with
an oldmanandalittle girlinside.

938
01:29:44,887 --> 01:29:46,354
Probably the doer that called.

939
01:29:46,422 --> 01:29:49,323
Jesus, he's got a kid.

940
01:29:49,392 --> 01:29:50,757
And an old man.

941
01:29:50,826 --> 01:29:52,851
- Thankyou, Paulie.
- Okay.

942
01:29:54,196 --> 01:29:56,858
We better take a closer look
at that third piece ofthe puzzle.

943
01:29:57,667 --> 01:29:59,066
Close.

944
01:29:59,135 --> 01:30:02,593
Three murders,
three evidence clusters...

945
01:30:04,774 --> 01:30:07,004
three pieces ofpaper.

946
01:30:07,076 --> 01:30:08,543
View scan.

947
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:24,184
Come on, Thelma. You're the queen
ofpuzzles. What doyou see?

948
01:30:25,895 --> 01:30:27,920
I'm looking.

949
01:30:27,997 --> 01:30:30,124
What ifwe lower the little one?

950
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:32,362
That one.

951
01:30:36,706 --> 01:30:39,539
Now twist that big one around.

952
01:30:50,486 --> 01:30:52,750
Now, doesn't that kinda
look like a face?

953
01:30:52,822 --> 01:30:54,881
Mouth, nose, eye.

954
01:30:55,891 --> 01:30:57,324
Enhance.

955
01:30:58,894 --> 01:31:00,486
Fade.

956
01:31:02,298 --> 01:31:03,822
That's a woman's face.

957
01:31:06,569 --> 01:31:08,662
Yes, it is.

958
01:31:09,805 --> 01:31:11,500
It's a logo.

959
01:31:12,375 --> 01:31:16,004
And old, turn-of-the-century...

960
01:31:16,078 --> 01:31:17,943
publisher's logo.

961
01:31:18,014 --> 01:31:20,244
You know it?

962
01:31:20,316 --> 01:31:22,648
I used to own a few ofthe books--

963
01:31:22,718 --> 01:31:24,310
gothic stories...

964
01:31:26,288 --> 01:31:27,778
crime stories.

965
01:31:28,891 --> 01:31:31,451
The killer is pointing us
to an old book.

966
01:31:57,553 --> 01:31:59,487
Can I helpyou?

967
01:32:03,092 --> 01:32:05,458
I called before about
turn-of-the-century crime books.

968
01:32:06,362 --> 01:32:08,728
Around the corner.
Helpyourself.

969
01:32:09,632 --> 01:32:11,065
Thanks.

970
01:33:30,012 --> 01:33:34,472
Aviation two to central. We're taking
a fly-byat the Brooklyn Bridge.

971
01:33:35,217 --> 01:33:37,913
Reportappears unfounded
at this time.

972
01:33:39,321 --> 01:33:42,188
Willproceedto check
EastRivershorelineandadvise.

973
01:33:42,258 --> 01:33:45,284
I need more small boats over here
to search under the pier.

974
01:33:45,361 --> 01:33:48,057
By the heliport, under the pier.

975
01:33:48,130 --> 01:33:51,065
Lincoln, it was the last murder
in the book.

976
01:33:51,133 --> 01:33:53,363
They've got to be
along the shore here somewhere.

977
01:33:53,435 --> 01:33:55,926
Listen, thelabsays
the odor we smelled...

978
01:33:56,005 --> 01:33:59,634
on the third piece ofthe puzzle
is probably diesel fuel.

979
01:33:59,708 --> 01:34:01,471
Now, there's an old boat
refueling station...

980
01:34:01,544 --> 01:34:04,172
at theStaten IslandFerrypier.

981
01:34:04,246 --> 01:34:06,339
Check thepilings underthepier.

982
01:34:53,229 --> 01:34:54,526
Found them!

983
01:34:55,598 --> 01:34:58,465
Over here! Here!

984
01:34:59,802 --> 01:35:01,895
Central, Icanseesomeone

985
01:35:01,971 --> 01:35:05,737
signaling us
from the oldStaten IslandFerrypier.

986
01:35:05,808 --> 01:35:09,073
There appears tobe two bodies
in the waternext to thepilings.

987
01:35:16,218 --> 01:35:20,154
Beadvisedsubjectsignaling
is mostlikely NYPD officerat thesite.

988
01:35:25,527 --> 01:35:27,427
Over here! Here!

989
01:35:35,471 --> 01:35:37,439
Under the pilings!

990
01:35:47,783 --> 01:35:49,410
Come over to the ladder.

991
01:35:52,621 --> 01:35:55,852
Central, beadvisedaideds
are outofthe water...

992
01:35:55,924 --> 01:35:59,087
andE.M.S. is working on them
at this time.

993
01:35:59,161 --> 01:36:03,757
- On standby.
- Clear the airway.

994
01:36:05,534 --> 01:36:07,126
Rhyme, areyou there?

995
01:36:07,202 --> 01:36:09,193
Yeah.

996
01:36:09,271 --> 01:36:10,704
Itlooks like we're toolate.

997
01:36:11,807 --> 01:36:13,365
Naw, forget it. He's dead.

998
01:36:13,442 --> 01:36:15,239
Bring the chopper in.

999
01:36:16,645 --> 01:36:18,272
The old man is gone.

1000
01:36:19,348 --> 01:36:21,976
They're still working on thegirl,
butitdoesn'tlookgood.

1001
01:36:23,786 --> 01:36:26,254
We need a level one
task force mobilization now!

1002
01:36:26,322 --> 01:36:28,950
- Try again. I know she's still there.
- Come on, kid.

1003
01:36:30,059 --> 01:36:31,720
Come on, try.

1004
01:36:33,796 --> 01:36:36,924
Youcan do it. Come on.

1005
01:36:36,999 --> 01:36:38,967
Breathe.

1006
01:36:39,034 --> 01:36:40,433
Breathe.

1007
01:36:43,639 --> 01:36:46,437
- Thereyou go!
- She's breathing.

1008
01:36:46,508 --> 01:36:49,477
I think she's gonna be okay. She's
breathing, Lincoln. Can you hear me?

1009
01:36:49,545 --> 01:36:53,447
- I thinkshe's gonnamakeit.
- Yeah. Good.

1010
01:36:54,783 --> 01:36:57,013
We gotherby the clues
thatheleftforus.

1011
01:36:58,187 --> 01:37:01,554
See whatyou can fi nd
around the fuel tanks.

1012
01:37:01,623 --> 01:37:02,885
Allright.

1013
01:37:26,982 --> 01:37:28,574
Lincoln, I found it.

1014
01:37:29,718 --> 01:37:32,619
It's a map ofsome kind,
some chunk ofa clean bone...

1015
01:37:33,856 --> 01:37:35,790
andapiece ofamedal
orabadge orsomething.

1016
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:40,920
There's some initials engraved.
Looks like...

1017
01:37:40,996 --> 01:37:44,591
a ''P'' and a ''B,'' or a--

1018
01:37:45,868 --> 01:37:47,426
It's a ''D.''
It's defi nitely a ''D.''

1019
01:37:48,303 --> 01:37:50,328
P.D.-- sounds like a cop's badge.

1020
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:53,174
You think he's gonna kill a cop?

1021
01:37:54,510 --> 01:37:56,034
Could be.

1022
01:37:57,212 --> 01:37:59,146
- Thelma?
- Maps?

1023
01:38:01,083 --> 01:38:02,846
Tell me about the map.

1024
01:38:03,719 --> 01:38:05,482
Looks like an old subway map.

1025
01:38:06,422 --> 01:38:08,447
I don't recognize
any ofthe stations.

1026
01:38:10,025 --> 01:38:11,652
You know, when I was scanning
those asbestos sites...

1027
01:38:11,727 --> 01:38:14,662
I came across a lot ofstations
that aren't in use anymore.

1028
01:38:14,730 --> 01:38:17,722
Okay.
There it is-- the oldest station.

1029
01:38:18,867 --> 01:38:22,735
On your map, is there an old station
indicated at the tip of Manhattan?

1030
01:38:26,208 --> 01:38:27,539
Navy Street.

1031
01:38:29,011 --> 01:38:32,344
- It's rightnext to thepier.
- Shit.

1032
01:38:32,414 --> 01:38:33,847
Cheney's here.

1033
01:38:38,854 --> 01:38:41,846
You talking to Rhyme on that thing?
Give me the radio.

1034
01:38:43,759 --> 01:38:47,217
Listen, Linc. This is Cheney, man.
What the hell doyou thinkyou're doing?

1035
01:38:47,296 --> 01:38:50,094
Stealing evidenceis agoddamn felony.
Youknowthat.

1036
01:38:50,165 --> 01:38:52,895
To my understanding,
there's no chain ofevidence voucher.

1037
01:38:52,968 --> 01:38:55,198
Oh, yeah?
Well, Igotsomenews foryou.

1038
01:38:55,270 --> 01:38:57,738
You are not a cop anymore.
You understand that?

1039
01:38:57,806 --> 01:39:00,741
Whatyouare
is a fucking meddling cripple.

1040
01:39:00,809 --> 01:39:03,869
Now, I'm gonna placeyour little
gofer here under arrest.

1041
01:39:03,946 --> 01:39:06,039
Youdon'tmindthat,
doya?

1042
01:39:06,782 --> 01:39:08,477
Lock her up.

1043
01:39:10,819 --> 01:39:12,411
Where'd she go?

1044
01:39:37,079 --> 01:39:39,047
I'm inside the NavyStreet tunnel.

1045
01:39:39,114 --> 01:39:41,605
There's gray dusteverywhere.
It's all overmyshoes.

1046
01:39:48,624 --> 01:39:49,886
There's footprints--

1047
01:39:49,958 --> 01:39:52,188
one set offootprints.

1048
01:39:52,261 --> 01:39:53,751
Amelia?

1049
01:39:53,829 --> 01:39:55,296
Hello, Lincoln, hello.

1050
01:39:55,364 --> 01:39:57,889
Amelia? Hello?

1051
01:39:57,966 --> 01:39:59,957
Themobile unityou've called
is notresponding...

1052
01:40:00,035 --> 01:40:01,627
oris outside the coveragearea.

1053
01:40:01,703 --> 01:40:02,795
Recall.

1054
01:41:04,032 --> 01:41:07,991
No dust--
He changed the numbers.

1055
01:41:08,070 --> 01:41:10,834
78499-- what is it?

1056
01:41:14,743 --> 01:41:16,870
What does it mean?

1057
01:41:36,598 --> 01:41:39,032
Help me, Rhyme. Help me.

1058
01:41:55,517 --> 01:41:57,417
He's gonna kill Rhyme.

1059
01:42:19,941 --> 01:42:21,374
Coming.

1060
01:42:26,848 --> 01:42:29,282
Hey. What areyou doing here?

1061
01:42:53,308 --> 01:42:55,173
Is that Amelia?

1062
01:42:58,046 --> 01:42:59,308
Bed mode.

1063
01:43:18,166 --> 01:43:20,430
Thelma, is thatyou?

1064
01:43:27,476 --> 01:43:29,808
No, it's me, Richard.

1065
01:43:30,846 --> 01:43:32,643
Richard. What's up?

1066
01:43:33,515 --> 01:43:36,951
Thelma asked me to come by,
check the heart-pacing machine.

1067
01:43:48,630 --> 01:43:51,827
- Where is Thelma?
- Out in the hall.

1068
01:44:10,152 --> 01:44:11,676
Phone mode.

1069
01:44:20,061 --> 01:44:24,088
I thought it was time we had a little
quiet moment together, you and I.

1070
01:44:24,166 --> 01:44:27,101
- No interruptions.
- Okay.

1071
01:44:27,169 --> 01:44:29,103
What's on your mind, Richard?

1072
01:44:29,304 --> 01:44:32,239
I think it's time
to set the record straight, Mr. Rhyme.

1073
01:44:33,975 --> 01:44:37,536
Syracuse--
you remember Syracuse, don'tyou?

1074
01:44:39,114 --> 01:44:41,014
You wrote an expert opinion.

1075
01:44:41,082 --> 01:44:43,141
I've written
thousands ofopinions, Richard.

1076
01:44:43,218 --> 01:44:46,847
Don't fucking tell me
you don't remember Syracuse.

1077
01:44:46,922 --> 01:44:49,914
They called it an investigation.
It was a witch hunt.

1078
01:44:49,991 --> 01:44:54,485
There was a forensics cop
up in Syracuse, New York.

1079
01:44:54,563 --> 01:44:56,656
Marcus Andrews.

1080
01:44:56,731 --> 01:44:59,757
Okay, yeah.
That was the cop that was...

1081
01:44:59,835 --> 01:45:01,598
suspected oftampering
with evidence...

1082
01:45:01,670 --> 01:45:03,228
in some homicide cases, right?

1083
01:45:03,305 --> 01:45:06,001
- Nothing was tampered with.
- Six innocent people went tojail.

1084
01:45:06,074 --> 01:45:07,666
- One hung himself.
- No, no. No.

1085
01:45:07,742 --> 01:45:10,575
Theywent tojail because theywere
guilty. Theywere scum.

1086
01:45:10,645 --> 01:45:14,046
- But he doctored the serology reports.
- No. Nothing was doctored.

1087
01:45:14,115 --> 01:45:15,844
He planted blood evidence
at the crime scenes.

1088
01:45:15,917 --> 01:45:18,579
Myworkwas impeccable.

1089
01:45:19,788 --> 01:45:21,722
Where we going with this...

1090
01:45:23,592 --> 01:45:24,889
Marcus?

1091
01:45:29,698 --> 01:45:31,962
Your report destroyed my life.

1092
01:45:32,033 --> 01:45:34,297
You know my report was not
a legal fi nding.

1093
01:45:34,369 --> 01:45:36,564
You never gave me the opportunity
to defend myself.

1094
01:45:36,638 --> 01:45:40,597
- I never even metyou.
- I was sent to prison for sixyears.

1095
01:45:40,675 --> 01:45:43,405
I spent two moreyears
trying to get toyou.

1096
01:45:43,478 --> 01:45:46,208
Doyou know what happens
to a cop injail? Doyou?

1097
01:45:46,281 --> 01:45:49,876
Every day-- every single day--

1098
01:45:49,951 --> 01:45:52,351
over and over, I was brutalized.

1099
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:54,445
I became a human toilet...

1100
01:45:54,522 --> 01:45:56,319
because ofyour expert opinion.

1101
01:45:56,391 --> 01:46:00,327
Well, you will never point the fi nger
ofblame at anyone ever again.

1102
01:46:03,031 --> 01:46:05,556
You were never as good
as they said you were, Mr. Rhyme.

1103
01:46:05,634 --> 01:46:08,125
I played you.
I tested you.

1104
01:46:08,203 --> 01:46:10,194
I gaveyou every clue.

1105
01:46:10,272 --> 01:46:12,706
You and your little helper
couldn't save those people.

1106
01:46:12,774 --> 01:46:15,174
Their blood is on your hands.
You failed.

1107
01:46:15,243 --> 01:46:17,177
You failed, you fuck.

1108
01:46:17,245 --> 01:46:21,011
Game ofchess, Mr. Rhyme.
Some people win, some people lose.

1109
01:46:21,082 --> 01:46:23,915
I win, Mr. Rhyme.
I win, you lose.

1110
01:46:27,923 --> 01:46:30,323
What kind ofvegetable
would you like to be, Mr. Rhyme?

1111
01:46:30,392 --> 01:46:31,916
A carrot?

1112
01:46:35,864 --> 01:46:37,525
How 'bout a zucchini?

1113
01:46:40,035 --> 01:46:42,663
Zucchini?
You wanna be a zucchini?

1114
01:46:44,039 --> 01:46:46,007
I'm sorry.
I didn't hearyou.

1115
01:46:47,042 --> 01:46:48,805
Did you say zucchini?

1116
01:47:25,914 --> 01:47:28,474
You wanna play?

1117
01:47:40,462 --> 01:47:42,692
Shall we cut outyour tongue,
Mr. Rhyme?

1118
01:47:44,399 --> 01:47:46,663
How 'boutyour eye?
Your eye--

1119
01:47:46,735 --> 01:47:48,828
we'll just pop it
right out ofthere.

1120
01:47:48,903 --> 01:47:50,837
No. Let's leave that for now.

1121
01:47:50,905 --> 01:47:55,001
You can watch me.
You can watch me while I gutyou open...

1122
01:47:55,076 --> 01:47:57,010
right down the middle.

1123
01:48:02,317 --> 01:48:03,750
What?

1124
01:48:06,588 --> 01:48:09,113
What? What?

1125
01:48:45,693 --> 01:48:48,958
Can you hear me? Lincoln.

1126
01:48:49,030 --> 01:48:50,463
Oh, God.

1127
01:48:54,903 --> 01:48:56,495
Step aside now.

1128
01:49:49,224 --> 01:49:51,089
I've always loved this view.

1129
01:49:51,159 --> 01:49:53,184
I like it too, Doc.

1130
01:49:54,229 --> 01:49:56,390
It's looking better every day.

1131
01:49:57,132 --> 01:49:59,066
- Hey, howyou guys doing?
- Santa!

1132
01:49:59,134 --> 01:50:00,726
- Good.
- Hi!

1133
01:50:00,802 --> 01:50:03,327
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

1134
01:50:07,075 --> 01:50:09,236
Hey, Linc. You got
an operating license for that?

1135
01:50:09,310 --> 01:50:11,744
I got a learner's permit.

1136
01:50:18,153 --> 01:50:20,883
- How's your boyfriend, Morris?
- Oh, he's in Florida.

1137
01:50:20,955 --> 01:50:23,082
- He play golf. He's okay.
- Playing golf!.

1138
01:50:23,158 --> 01:50:25,888
- Captain Flash on wheels.
- Yo, Paulie. Merry Christmas.

1139
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:27,325
Merry Christmas.

1140
01:50:27,395 --> 01:50:31,058
Hey, Linc, ifyou're gonna be cruisin',
you might as well be amusin'.

1141
01:50:31,132 --> 01:50:33,692
- Thereyou go.
- Thankyou, Eddie.

1142
01:50:33,768 --> 01:50:36,100
It's nice.

1143
01:50:38,406 --> 01:50:40,237
- Come on in.
- Merry Christmas.

1144
01:50:40,308 --> 01:50:41,741
Merry Christmas.

1145
01:50:45,146 --> 01:50:46,909
You're looking real good,
Mr. Rhyme.

1146
01:50:46,981 --> 01:50:48,278
Mr. Rhyme?

1147
01:50:48,349 --> 01:50:50,442
It's Lincoln toyou.
Loosen your shorts.

1148
01:50:54,455 --> 01:50:56,753
Oh, my goodness.

1149
01:50:56,824 --> 01:50:59,884
Oh, my goodness. Merry Christmas.
What areyou doing here?

1150
01:50:59,961 --> 01:51:03,021
- Merry Christmas, Uncle Lincoln.
- Oh, give me a kiss!

1151
01:51:03,097 --> 01:51:05,691
Merry Christmas, Kimmy.
How areyou?

1152
01:51:05,767 --> 01:51:09,567
Howyou doing, Tony? I didn't know
you were gonna make this trip.

1153
01:51:09,637 --> 01:51:11,195
Wouldn't be a surprise ifyou knew.

1154
01:51:11,272 --> 01:51:14,708
Oh, I'm sorry. Amelia, this is
my sister,Janine, her family.

1155
01:51:14,776 --> 01:51:17,370
- Amelia.
- Yeah, I know. Hi.

1156
01:51:17,445 --> 01:51:20,073
- You know?

1157
01:51:20,148 --> 01:51:23,083
On the phone.

Merry Christmas.
