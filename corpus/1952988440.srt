1
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:39,477
Everything worth anything
is both terrifying and beautiful.

2
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,914
Like the first time you do something
that you know is wrong.

3
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:51,256
You know it's wrong
and yet you do it anyway.

4
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,932
There was a ladybug
crawling around my ankle

5
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:03,006
when I saw Victoria let her
grandmother's bird escape from its cage.

6
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:07,111
I watched the bird disappear
into the endless sky like a lonely balloon.

7
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:13,175
It was so sad.

8
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,785
That image left a scar
that never completely healed,

9
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:22,860
because until then
I thought that bad things

10
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,293
could only happen by accident,
never on purpose.

11
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,598
It was Victoria who first
made me confront

12
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,210
that danger existed
on the inside of everybody.

13
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,318
Now she's coming to my school.

14
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,292
Mom, that's so much worse.

15
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,803
Every year my mother hopes

16
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,133
this five-hour drive to school
will be something that it never is.

17
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,077
What I share
with my mother is silence.

18
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:32,259
My heart exists within
the stone walls of that building.

19
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,822
That's where I live.

20
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,293
Tanner Hall is majestic
but crumbling.

21
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,039
It's just a fact,

22
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:47,974
as true as the uncertainty
of the year ahead.

23
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,277
- Fernie!
- Oh!

24
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,508
- Hello!
- Fernie!

25
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,153
- Get up here right now!
- I'm coming!

26
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,907
Fernie!

27
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,342
- Hello!
- I missed you so much!

28
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,310
Oh my God, you look so good!

29
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,187
You're so clumsy, Victoria.

30
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,118
It's not my fault.

31
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,690
He didn't leave me
enough room to get out.

32
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,366
This can't possibly be the school.

33
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:18,901
It looks like the pictures
in the orientation packet.

34
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,430
There was an orientation packet?
I never saw it.

35
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,407
Oh, I spared you, Vicky.

36
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,876
It was boring.

37
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,538
It's not supposed
to read like a magazine.

38
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,878
No wonder Daddy
has a girlfriend.

39
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,781
You're such a moron.

40
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,955
Would you just relax?

41
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,322
You're getting yourself
worked up over nothing.

42
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,592
Olga, hi!

43
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,734
Ah! Roxanne!

44
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:53,403
It's so good to see you.

45
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,408
I've been thinking about
when we were in school together.

46
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:04,983
The jerk driver forgot
to load my bags into the trunk!

47
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,175
I have jack shit to wear!

48
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,321
Hey, you know what?
They'll find your bag, you know.

49
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:14,448
In the meantime you could
maybe borrow some of Fern's clothes.

50
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,294
Fernanda, look at you.

51
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,024
Fern, you remember Victoria, right?

52
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,363
- You knew each other when you were little.
- Yeah, sort of.

53
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,874
You forgot to introduce your friends.

54
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,947
Right, sorry.

55
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,017
- This is Lucasta and this is Kate.
- Hello.

56
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,653
Let's go check in.

57
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,555
Would you two mind
showing me around the school?

58
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,322
Yeah, no problem.
I wanted to smoke a cigarette.

59
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,725
How do you know Fern?

60
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:57,391
So this will allow my friends
to be able to take her off campus

61
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:01,061
- and out to dinner and-- thank you.
- Precisely.

62
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,299
- Please sign here.
- Mom, I really don't want

63
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,703
to spend my weekends
with your friends.

64
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,209
It might be nice
to get off campus for a weekend.

65
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:18,589
- What's in the bag?
- Oh, I borrowed it from my roommate.

66
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:22,192
It stinks.

67
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,526
Uh, what are you doing?

68
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,689
Borrowing clothes, remember?

69
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,426
Oh, right. Uh, let me help you.

70
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,832
- No, that's okay.
- Okay.

71
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,741
Mr. Middlewood, hurry!

72
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,420
Mr. Middlewood,
we need your help!

73
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,183
Kate fell in the shower!

74
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,926
Mr. Middlewood, help!
We need you!

75
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,931
Kate fell in the sho--
Kate fell in the shower.

76
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,468
- She needs you.
- Everybody out of my way.

77
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,369
Kate? Sorry.

78
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,305
Kate!

79
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:15,275
Sorry. Kate!

80
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,539
Kate!

81
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,280
Sorry! God!
Oh my God. Sorry.

82
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,583
- Kate.
- Oh God. Mr. Middlewood.

83
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,656
Oh my God.

84
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,485
Oh my God. Are you all right?

85
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,098
Yes, it's just my leg.

86
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,465
Does that hurt?
Does it hurt when I do this?

87
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,263
A little bit higher.

88
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:43,601
- Higher?
- Higher.

89
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:47,267
- Does it hurt?
- Oh, it just tingles.

90
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:51,746
Higher. Higher. Higher.

91
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:54,511
Oh, this is a new feeling to me.

92
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,250
Higher.
Shh!

93
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,518
Can we have
some privacy, please?

94
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,134
Is that all right?
Does that feel okay?

95
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:18,037
- It's stinging through my pelvic bone.
- What? Am I--

96
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:22,544
Oh my God.

97
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,311
Mr. Middlewood,
it hurts so bad.

98
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,449
Can't you do something for the pain?

99
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,858
What's going on?

100
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,692
You, this isn't your floor.

101
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,801
Get back to your dorm.
Everyone get back to their rooms.

102
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,698
Go!

103
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,172
Hey.

104
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,685
Fern, are you going to eat all that?

105
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:44,455
Breakfast is
the most important meal of the day.

106
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,598
Maybe, but do you have
the metabolism for it?

107
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,030
I'm gonna go get ready for class.

108
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,731
Save me a seat.

109
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:04,441
Who's that boy?

110
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,643
Oh, that's Peter,
the headmistress's son.

111
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,947
He's cute.
What's he doing here?

112
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,614
- He goes to school here.
- He does?

113
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,386
Miss Wallace is too cheap
to pay tuition to another school,

114
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,551
so she makes him go to ours.

115
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,630
To be a boy at an all-girls school.

116
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,636
Yeah, you would think
he would know how to have fun

117
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,331
in his situation.

118
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,575
Why would you even waste
your vision on him?

119
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,806
- Hello.
- Because he has so much access.

120
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,577
- To what?
- His mother's files,

121
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,686
her stationery,

122
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,654
the key to the front door.

123
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:54,023
Hey, can you help?
Can you hold this straight for me?

124
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,133
- Mm-hmm.
- Just so that the under part

125
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:59,759
- doesn't go into this. Yeah.
- Is this my shirt?

126
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:02,304
- No.
- What are you doing to it?

127
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,533
Victoria found these
from the lost and found.

128
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,337
She said they were too plain,
so I'm restyling them for her.

129
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,674
No, these are my shirts.
She borrowed them from me.

130
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,613
Oh shit. Sorry, Fern.

131
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,652
It's not your fault. it's hers.

132
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,516
- Who?
- I'll take it off.

133
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,851
- Victoria.
- Oh, she's awesome.

134
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,651
Hey, Fern Fern,
can you help me with my homework?

135
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,694
At least she's not in our dorm.

136
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,063
Right?

137
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:32,032
Victoria, you know we have
no empty beds upstairs.

138
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,298
Listen, we're negotiating right now.
Let's try to come up with a solution.

139
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,032
I agree!
Get me out of this room

140
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,506
and the problem is solved.

141
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,577
Why should I have to sleep in a pisspot

142
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,907
when I am not the bedwetter?

143
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,550
Bedwetting is not that unusual.

144
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,708
It happens to deep sleepers.

145
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,548
I'm going to be ill.

146
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,553
My recommendation would he

147
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,318
that you wake Margaret up

148
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,757
and take her
to the toilet every three hours.

149
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,989
- It sounds like a plan.
- You must be kidding!

150
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,360
Every three hours.

151
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,508
No.

152
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,877
I don't have to go.

153
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,121
Okay, look up.

154
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,704
Oh my God.
You're not putting that blue on me.

155
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,305
Fern, you have a very tough palate.

156
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,567
I'm just trying to make you
brighten up a little bit.

157
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,870
Thanks, no. it's blue.

158
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:51,142
We'll do-- well, first put this on.

159
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,309
You're welcome.

160
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:01,057
I can't believe I let my mom talk me
into hanging out with her loser friends.

161
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:04,218
- That is such a drag.
- I think the blue looks nice, actually.

162
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,898
Victoria, what are you doing today?

163
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:11,797
- Today is the day.
- What day?

164
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,565
- The day I get Peter to hand over the key.
- To sneak out?

165
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,730
He's never gonna give you the key.
It's not gonna happen.

166
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,309
Do you always have
such little faith in your friends?

167
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,810
No, I have
a lot of faith in my friends.

168
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,449
- I just don't want to get in trouble.
- I fixed it.

169
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:28,017
Thank you.

170
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,519
We're just gonna have a bit of fun.

171
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:34,989
Besides, who sits around
boarding school obeying every rule?

172
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,986
What?

173
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,655
- Jesus.
- Kind of you.

174
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,631
Kate, it's your last year.

175
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,670
Don't you finally want
to have some real fun?

176
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,106
Hmm?

177
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,701
- Yeah yeah. If you get the key...
- We'll sneak out. Totally.

178
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,039
- Yes.
- Consider it done.

179
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,615
Oh my God.

180
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,378
- She's amazing, right?
- She's so cool.

181
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,283
I can't even believe it.

182
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,667
Fernanda?

183
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,000
Yeah?

184
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,234
I'm Gio, Gwen's husband.

185
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,902
Gwen, your mother's friend?

186
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,775
Really?

187
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,677
You wanna get in the car?

188
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,119
Okay.

189
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:23,965
# Your tongue, your transfer #

190
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,036
# Your hand, your answer,
on the bus... #

191
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,139
You like this song?

192
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,366
I've never heard it before.

193
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:35,138
Really?
You like music, don't you?

194
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:39,479
Yeah. it's not my life
or anything though.

195
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,985
Okay, that's it.

196
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,712
How about we make
a detour into town?

197
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,459
Isn't Gwen expecting us?

198
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,484
She's doing her own thing anyway.

199
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,664
- And what's that?
- Decorating the baby's room.

200
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,802
I didn't know you guys had a baby.

201
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,836
We will in a month or thereabouts.

202
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:04,736
That's exciting.

203
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,248
When did you move here?

204
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:15,113
A better question is
why did we move here?

205
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,020
Why did you move here?

206
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:23,126
Oh, uh, well, you're not supposed
to ask 'cause it's a better question,

207
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:24,659
- but...
- But?

208
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,491
...I wanted you to ask me
that 'cause-- yeah.

209
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,691
- No, I'm just kidding. No.
- # Watching us #

210
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:36,102
# Kiss me on the bus... #

211
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,970
George.

212
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,541
George, why don't you put
your book down

213
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:46,513
so we can spend some quality time
together while the girls are in town?

214
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,778
What?

215
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,046
Hmm?

216
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,146
Oh.

217
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,490
Maggie, not-- not now.

218
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,492
I'm-- I'm really not in the mood.

219
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,358
Sometimes you have to push yourself

220
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,023
over the threshold
to get into the mood, okay?

221
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:06,193
Why don't we try some of the tools

222
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,361
that we've been learning in therapy?

223
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,633
Let's get in the cricket stance.

224
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,639
Feel that stretch?

225
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,641
- Um, yeah.
- You're so tight right there.

226
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,802
- You feel that right there?
- Yeah.

227
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,539
- That feel nice?
- Yeah.

228
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,911
There's a smile I like right there.

229
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,882
- Maggie, what are-- what are you doing?
- Shh.

230
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,521
- Mmm.
- That's--

231
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:27,351
- That's nice. Mmm.
- Maggie, what are you doing?

232
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:31,086
George, I just love the way
your hair smells like tobacco.

233
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,026
It's nice. Mmm.

234
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:38,066
Yeah. Oh, there.
Oh, thank you.

235
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,364
Mmm. Ah.
Counterclockwise, George.

236
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,939
- Okay.
- Mmm.

237
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,339
Now let's do
some positive affirmations, all right?

238
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,377
- Your turn.
- Umm,

239
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,610
- Yesterday...
- Yesterday.

240
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:56,117
...The way you looked was so--

241
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:59,017
- you were so committed...
- Mm-hmm.

242
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:03,058
...And very--
you were very pretty.

243
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,790
Go on.

244
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,091
That's-- that's it,
or-- yeah.

245
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,131
Uh-huh. Really good.

246
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,464
That was nice, George.

247
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,572
I think it's working. Feel that?

248
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,544
Okay.

249
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,079
Maggie, this is--
this isn't working for me.

250
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,943
Okay. Shh. it's all right.

251
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,550
- It happens to a lot of men your age.
- Okay.

252
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:30,153
Okay? Just give me a minute.
I'm gonna go get something, okay?

253
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,253
- No, Maggie, I'm just not--
- Shh!

254
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,447
- I just don't think this is the kind--
- I'll be right back.

255
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,719
- It just isn't working for me.
- Be right back. Just relax.

256
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,399
# It's harder than they say
to try to settle down #

257
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:53,635
# You see it in her line,
you look it up and down #

258
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,973
# You see it end to end,
you read it like a book #

259
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,241
# And then for what it is
you take a look #

260
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:02,614
# And when it rains, when it rains,
oh, the sun comes out again #

261
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,915
# Crown of age, crown of age,
it's like it's always been #

262
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:09,082
# And you know and you know,
oh, what you've gotta do #

263
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:12,752
# Crown of age, crown of age,
yeah, it's all up to you #

264
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,332
- # It's harder than you know... #
- Come on, let's go inside.

265
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,964
# To get where you belong,
somehow you're always there... #

266
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,372
So isn't there anything
you like about living up here?

267
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,643
Not one thing.

268
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:36,209
Well, I just haven't
figured it out yet.

269
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,950
I don't know. it's nothing like
my old neighborhood.

270
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,118
It's not important.

271
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,195
It's crazy to get
so attached to a place.

272
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,962
Yeah, I get that.

273
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,068
Don't you have any friends
up here, though?

274
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,069
No, not really.

275
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,866
But it could be
turning around for me.

276
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,683
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

277
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,492
These are precious moments.

278
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:22,599
Oh, Maggie, we talked about that.
That doesn't work. We know that.

279
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,735
How many have you been taking?

280
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,733
- Well, if I take--
- Shh.

281
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,203
- If I take more than one, I get a headache.
- Okay, well, let's take two.

282
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,239
- No. No no no, that's more than one.
- Here. Shh.

283
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,843
Okay, Just take these.
Here you go.

284
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,001
- My head is gonna--
- Just take 'em, George.

285
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,681
Okay, here's some shiitaki tea.

286
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,218
Come on, let's go.

287
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:47,118
There you go. That's nice.

288
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,350
Okay, there you go.

289
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:53,361
- Here we go. Is that nice?
- Yeah, let me-- let me get my hand up.

290
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,693
There you go. Oh, okay.

291
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:57,857
That's better.

292
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,866
It's gonna take
at least 30 minutes to kick in.

293
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,971
I'm gonna wait
for the pills to rescue us, okay?

294
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:05,132
So I want to start with some visualization
that Dr. Adler taught us, okay?

295
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,970
Now I want you to name a country.

296
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,374
Uh, Botswana.

297
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,814
- Germany.
- Okay, I can work with Germany.

298
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:15,213
Home of the sausage, huh?

299
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:19,914
- Maggie.
- You are a navy BMW 750. You like that?

300
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,752
- Okay, George close your eyes.
- Yeah.

301
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:24,417
All right, we've got a full tank of gas.

302
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,893
- I am-- okay.
- Close your eyes. God, I'm so moist.

303
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:30,431
You're gliding
through the smooth pavement

304
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,468
of the Autobahn, hugging...

305
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,163
...every curve. Okay?

306
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,330
You surge forward

307
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,272
like a powerful bullet,

308
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,241
- searching for its target.
- Mr. Middlewood,

309
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:46,144
- my pelvis tingles.
- You find it? A dark tiny black hole.

310
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,981
Right there, George.
Come on, give it to me.

311
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,180
Come on, George.
What is going on down there?

312
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,517
- Maggie, I just--
- It's like boiled shrimp.

313
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,751
I need at least 30 minutes
for it to kick in.

314
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,691
We don't have 30 minutes, George.

315
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,331
I'm not waiting 30 minutes.

316
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:05,162
All right, I'm gonna
show you something, okay?

317
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,099
- You see this, George?
- Yeah, I do.

318
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,500
- You see this? This is a hole.
- Yeah.

319
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,951
Oh, all right.

320
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,384
- I can't--
- Let me see who's at the door.

321
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,684
- Just give me 30 minutes.
- Don't move, all right? Just get it up.

322
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,192
30 minutes.

323
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,357
What happened?

324
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,364
I tripped and fell
into the emergency glass case.

325
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,868
- Are you all right?
- It really hurts, actually.

326
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:45,065
Oh. Well, I guess I should take you
to go see the nurse, right?

327
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:47,905
Yes, okay.
First I wanted to give you this.

328
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,048
To the front door I think.

329
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,048
Oh. Well, we wouldn't want this
to get into the wrong hands.

330
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,015
Thank you.

331
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:58,212
No, don't thank me.

332
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,414
George, I'll be back in five.

333
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,490
I was checking for moles.

334
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:04,594
It's just-- I couldn't view 'em.

335
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,230
I'm so sorry you hurt yourself.
Let's go.

336
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,026
See, Margaret,
the urine comes down here,

337
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:12,601
it goes through the bladder

338
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,534
and the pee comes out
through the urethra

339
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:18,231
and it goes, swoosh,
down the toilet.

340
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,037
Oh God.
Okay, let's go out in the hall.

341
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,541
it's not that difficult.

342
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,705
You can understand that, can't you?

343
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,352
Oh gosh, let's see.

344
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,784
- Oh yeah, that's a gash.
- Mmm.

345
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:33,514
Victoria, would you consider

346
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,785
sleeping on a rollaway cot
on my floor this semester?

347
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:40,260
Ow! You mean
the high school dorm?

348
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,796
Oh yes yes.

349
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:44,127
Fight it, fight it, fight it.

350
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:47,533
Yeah. I just think our little Margaret
there is a little upset.

351
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:51,470
I think she's painfully embarrassed
about her situation.

352
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,938
Mmm, poor Margaret.

353
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,975
Yeah, poor thing. it's tough.

354
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:58,809
You know, Victoria, I'll look forward
to having a girl like you on my floor.

355
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,714
- Huh.
- It'll be nice.

356
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,057
# Playing me what I want to hear... #

357
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,731
Thanks.

358
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:21,662
# Don't make me
have to come down there... #

359
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,608
I kinda have to pee.

360
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:37,578
# I wanna hear,
a few minutes, a few minutes... #

361
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:16,653
- I should get back to school.
- Now?

362
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,056
We have time to visit Gwen,
don't we?

363
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:20,822
No, you guys didn't sign me out
for the weekend,

364
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,023
- just through dinner.
- Oh shit. Really?

365
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:25,362
She's gonna be so upset.

366
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,233
Get in the car.

367
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:36,737
- Okay?
- Okay.

368
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:39,644
All right,
this should be all right for you.

369
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,310
Here you go.

370
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:21,684
Hey, Lu, how come you never put
any male characters in your comics?

371
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:26,125
I don't know.
Girls are more fun to draw, I guess.

372
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,699
Hey, Fern.

373
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,804
I-- I really like this drawing.

374
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,447
- You can have it if you want.
- Really?

375
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:48,073
I will add it to my collection
of Lucasta originals.

376
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,278
Hank, why are you always here?

377
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,481
Oh. I'm sorry.

378
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:56,648
- I was actually just leaving.
- No.

379
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,455
He's just delivering a pizza.
Mind your own business.

380
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,929
Well, I was just returning your jacket.

381
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,962
It's dirty.
You can't return my things dirty.

382
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,971
It was already like that.

383
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,668
No, it wasn't.
What is that anyway, dried blood?

384
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,278
I have no idea.

385
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:21,478
Looks like chocolate.
I can clean it.

386
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,916
There we go.
Crisis solved.

387
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:27,649
You know,
I've got to go back to work.

388
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:30,919
- Bye, Hank.
- Bye.

389
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,324
Hey, by the by,

390
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,363
I got the key from Peter,

391
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:39,696
so you me and Kate
next Saturday night. That'll be great.

392
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:42,839
Oh, and I'm just down the hall now.

393
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:47,505
- What room?
- They gave me the student lounge.

394
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,169
No way. As your bedroom?

395
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,212
What's the big deal?

396
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:54,180
It's like having your own apartment.

397
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,717
Well, why don't you come now
and we'll watch a film?

398
00:27:56,875 --> 00:28:00,345
You are so lucky.
You have a TV.

399
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,392
Actually, you know what?
I'm just gonna stay here.

400
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:08,361
I just started a drawing
that I'd like to finish. You know?

401
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,864
Well, just bring along
your sketch book.

402
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:14,463
Another time.
Thanks, though.

403
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:24,737
I didn't want to tell anyone about Gio.

404
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:27,383
I wanted to keep him for myself.

405
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:22,265
As it turns out, the nights were
keeping Victoria's secrets too.

406
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,906
I didn't know what to do.

407
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,576
The loneliness of Victoria's pain
was unreachable,

408
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,987
so I did nothing.

409
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:45,219
Oh!

410
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:48,126
- Sorry. I'm really sorry, Kate.
- It's okay.

411
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,164
It- it's okay.

412
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:52,427
Here. Are these yours?

413
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:57,429
Oh. Yeah, the nurse gave them
to me for my ankle injury.

414
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,137
Well, you'd better keep up that limp.

415
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,747
Hey, why don't you just take one?

416
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,440
I don't think
a pill would help, somehow.

417
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,281
I think it will. I'm working
a pretty good buzz right now.

418
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:13,445
Come on.

419
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:17,287
A really good book can be an escape

420
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:20,191
and transport the reader

421
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:22,857
even out of his own life.

422
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,332
You're late.

423
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:29,338
Oh.

424
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,269
Kate, could you sit there, please?

425
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,615
Is this gonna be my seat
for the entire semester?

426
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,148
Yes.

427
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,780
That applies-
applies to all of you.

428
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:49,857
Wherever you are seated today

429
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,996
is where you'll be seated
for the remainder of the term.

430
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,693
- We're so close.
- Yes.

431
00:30:58,857 --> 00:30:59,892
We are.

432
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:04,234
Are you wearing cologne?

433
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:08,005
It's witch hazel, actually.

434
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,844
Okay, moving along.

435
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,914
Our reading assignments this term

436
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:16,052
will be decided by you guys.

437
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:20,748
So what books would you
recommend to one another?

438
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:26,020
- Kate?
- "Lolita."

439
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,499
Nabokov.

440
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:32,430
That's a very rich choice.

441
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:33,934
Thank you.

442
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,534
Ugh, cl-- class dismissed.

443
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,905
- Hey, Fern?
- Yeah.

444
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,416
I was wondering
if you could help me write something.

445
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,678
Yeah, sure.

446
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,789
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

447
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,454
This is in first.

448
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,258
- You're gonna ease off the clutch.
- Right.

449
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:45,164
- Fuck! Okay, that was really bad.
- No no no, you're doing great.

450
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,810
I love your style.
I want you to put it back into neutral.

451
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,072
- Where's that? Okay.
- Right here. All right?

452
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:54,342
Now-- good-- start it again.

453
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:56,986
Ready?

454
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,247
Are you ready?
Ease it--

455
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,288
no. Whoa! Whoa!

456
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:07,157
Sorry. I think
we should switch now.

457
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:13,033
Here you go.

458
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,679
Mmm! I'm sorry.

459
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,683
Sorry.

460
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,322
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

461
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:40,558
Okay.

462
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,221
All right.

463
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,538
- It's just not cool.
- What's not cool

464
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,509
is the fact that
we're not going out tonight

465
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:00,013
and tonight is the fair.
This is the only night we can do this.

466
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,987
Guys, what are you doing?

467
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:06,747
You're taking forever.

468
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:10,923
What's going on?

469
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:16,093
Um, apparently we're not going.

470
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:18,666
What? why?

471
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:20,894
Because you can't exclude Fern.

472
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,436
She's our best friend.

473
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:24,335
Huh.

474
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:27,176
Where is she anyway?

475
00:34:27,332 --> 00:34:29,573
She's with Peter right now.

476
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,839
Really? Why?

477
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:34,108
She's helping him write
an essay or something.

478
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,412
I thought you said
Peter kept to himself.

479
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,886
He did, I thought.

480
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:42,855
Obviously I don't know
anything about Peter.

481
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:46,556
I mean I never would've imagined
that he'd help us sneak out.

482
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:49,961
Yeah, how did
you manage that anyway?

483
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:54,037
Let's go get Fern.

484
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,968
- Do you think she'd come with us still?
- Yes.

485
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,301
You guys are right.
I feel really bad.

486
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:01,137
- Can we--
- Yeah.

487
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,301
- Yes, let's go.
- Can we still go? Okay, cool.

488
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:15,591
So, um, Victoria wants you to go.

489
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:19,092
- Who cares?
- We care.

490
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,958
It won't be any fun without you, Fern.

491
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,657
I can't anyway.
I told Peter I'd help him write something.

492
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:26,962
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

493
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,399
He should be here any minute.

494
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,631
Well, you guys figure out
what you wanna do

495
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,797
and I'm going to go use the toilet.

496
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:44,611
- Peter.
- Yeah?

497
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:48,588
Hi. Fern asked me to come say
she can't make it.

498
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:52,194
- What? Why?
- Period. Blech.

499
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,193
Sorry.

500
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,029
- Bye.
- I don't want to get expelled.

501
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,634
We're not gonna get expelled, okay?

502
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:02,169
God! Peter gave Victoria the key.

503
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:05,536
Yeah, even if we do get caught,
Miss Wallace is not gonna expel her son.

504
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,005
Please.

505
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,209
Well, he's not coming,
so can we go?

506
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:19,014
- Hmm?
- Fine.

507
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,884
- So?
- We're going.

508
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:23,151
Come on. Come on.

509
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:24,725
Shh!

510
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,834
Is it really gonna work?

511
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,300
- Hmm?
- Shh shh shh. Shh.

512
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,572
Shh shh!

513
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,216
Okay, are you ready?

514
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,514
Okay. One two-- go!

515
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:11,105
# I don't know where I've been going... #

516
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:13,936
# Or where I have come from #

517
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:19,106
# Everything here looks the same... #

518
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:22,251
Oh my God.
I totally kick ass at this game,

519
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,444
so I am buying for everyone.

520
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:26,111
- Whoo!
- Gimme gimme gimme.

521
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,790
I rule!

522
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:35,693
Whoo!

523
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,396
- A pig.
- One more throw.

524
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,298
Well, I am completely offended.

525
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:44,303
- May I please have the cock?
- The what?

526
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:46,533
- The cock.
- The rooster.

527
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:50,305
Go ahead and look at it.
Look at it. Here we go.

528
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,209
- Yay!
- Yes! You did it! You did it!

529
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,940
Whoo!
Look! I won! I won!

530
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:57,279
- You won?!
- Hey! No, you didn't!

531
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,581
- Yes, I did.
- That was my dart.

532
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,384
- No, it wasn't. What did I win?
- But I popped that balloon.

533
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:05,619
What are you, nuts? I saw the whole thing.
My daughter popped that balloon.

534
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,765
Are you calling me a liar?
Is he calling me a liar?

535
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,331
Okay okay.

536
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:14,061
We're all here to have fun.

537
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:18,738
Thank you.

538
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:25,113
I do hope you've come to kill me.

539
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:29,912
I have a terribly painful-- oh!
--painful painful malady.

540
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:33,612
Yes. How would you like to die?

541
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:37,282
Poisons?
Dagger through the heart?

542
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,325
Strangulation?

543
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,293
Shotgun?

544
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,432
Okay, I'm bored. Let's roll.

545
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:46,501
I want to stay
and watch how she dies.

546
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:53,802
The bone crush--
a wise choice, my dear.

547
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:05,879
I'm gonna get this.
I get this all the time, guys.

548
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:11,226
I've got the eye of the tiger,
eye of the tiger, eye of the tiger.

549
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:16,295
I won!

550
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:23,568
- Don't look.
- What? What?

551
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:25,332
- The Middlewoods are right behind us.
- Oh my God.

552
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:27,407
- Don't look!
- Stop it!

553
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,010
Okay, we have to run away.

554
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,841
One two three.

555
00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:34,540
Whoo!

556
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:38,176
- Surprise!
- Whoa.

557
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:41,415
- What are you doing here?
- We escaped.

558
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,393
I wish we hadn't run into these guys.

559
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,326
Yeah, pick it up.

560
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,660
I have a surprise for you.

561
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:53,393
- A surprise?
- It's a cock hat,

562
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,560
Mr. Cock.

563
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:59,508
Come on, let's go get high
on the Ferris wheel.

564
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:04,340
- Yes!
- I guess it's off to the Ferris wheel.

565
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:07,711
Yeah. Umm...

566
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:11,053
Yeah, actually, I think I'm gonna

567
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:13,052
catch up with you guys later.

568
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:14,519
Wait. Where are you going?

569
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:18,255
Yeah, I just really don't wanna spend
the night babysitting.

570
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,953
- Slices, anyone?
- No thanks, Kenny.

571
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,427
Thanks, Ken.

572
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:31,306
- Where's Kate?
- Getting into trouble on the Ferris wheel.

573
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:34,272
Should probably go look for her.

574
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:38,312
- Oh. Well, I'll come with you.
- Perfect.

575
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,745
- Good. All right.
- Okay.

576
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,907
- You guys have fun.
- Bye.

577
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:46,715
- Bye. Don't be mad. Love you.
- Okay.

578
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:49,324
I think I'm gonna go
check out the produce.

579
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,824
- Do you wanna come?
- Uh, no.

580
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:53,428
- Come on.
- No no no, I'm just--

581
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,222
- Okay. I'll see you later
- Okay.

582
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,438
- Hi.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

583
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,446
Are you here by yourself?

584
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,744
No.

585
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:19,252
I'm with my friends.
We snuck out.

586
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,983
I used to sneak out
of my parents' house all the time.

587
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,524
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

588
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,252
What would happen
when you got caught?

589
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:30,997
The threat of boarding school.

590
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,466
So basically my life
is your worst-case scenario.

591
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:37,868
No, actually, my life right now
is my worst-case scenario.

592
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:41,476
Gio, you wouldn't believe the selection
of cheddars they have here.

593
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,976
They even have one
that's marbleized with beer.

594
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:47,139
- Is that Fernanda?
- Hi.

595
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:49,376
You look just like your mother.

596
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,552
- Hello.
- Hello.

597
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,159
What's your name?

598
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:03,361
- # Cherry lives with a man in Queens... #
- Light it up.

599
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,695
# She wants to get lit
in a limousine #

600
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:10,567
# She locked herself
in the girls' bathroom... #

601
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:13,902
I'm a dragon!
What you looking at?

602
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:16,011
Aren't you supposed
to be keeping a low profile?

603
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:18,340
Lu!

604
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:21,575
- You're my best friend!
- Kate doesn't know how to lay low.

605
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,514
She's gonna get us all expelled.

606
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,381
I love you!

607
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,159
Look at the stars. They--

608
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:36,992
- Come up here! it's amazing.
- They look so close, don't they?

609
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:43,536
When I was little I used to get freckles
on my face every summer

610
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:47,540
and my brother would tell me
that they were a map of the stars.

611
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:52,443
So I would sit in front of the mirror
and search for the Big Dipper endlessly.

612
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:54,879
Stupid.

613
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:01,345
Are-- are-- are they still there?

614
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,423
Maybe.

615
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,926
There might be traces
of a sun-kissed seven-year-old.

616
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:20,868
Oh. I'm-- I'm-- I'm sorry.

617
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:24,777
No, it's fine.

618
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:29,449
It's fine. it's okay.

619
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:33,779
Whoa.

620
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:41,788
Whoo!

621
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:46,927
Harvest Fest!

622
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:49,469
Are they gonna let us off?

623
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,732
So how much for one of these?

624
00:43:51,896 --> 00:43:53,671
Oh, well, that depends.

625
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,505
- On what?
- Well, lots of things, actually.

626
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,408
The wood finish, the hardware,

627
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:00,947
the size, the bedding,
the pillow insert, you know.

628
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:04,814
- Oh. Interesting.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

629
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,148
Well, I really love
this chrome hardware.

630
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:13,523
- Yes.
- Looks almost nautical.

631
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:16,631
I love this cherry wood.

632
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:19,529
- Is this satin?
- Yeah.

633
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,829
Can you have it in different colors?

634
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:25,634
- Mm-hmm.
- What would look best against my skin,

635
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:30,111
red or navy blue?

636
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:33,715
Oh, well, I'd say the red.
It's more festive. Yeah.

637
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,154
I wonder what it must feel like
to lie in one of these.

638
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,961
Gio, the arches.

639
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:58,530
So I take this great Italian cooking class
on Saturday mornings.

640
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,642
When you come over for the weekend,
you're gonna have to join me.

641
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:02,800
- We can do it together.
- Yeah, it'll be fun.

642
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:07,413
Hey, isn't this song
on one of the albums you got me?

643
00:45:07,572 --> 00:45:10,143
- Yes, it is.
- I like this song.

644
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:11,548
You bought records?

645
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,588
I thought Fernanda couldn't hang out
'cause she had a paper due.

646
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:18,659
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I lent-- I lent her records

647
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:21,353
- from the trunk of my car.
- Where have you been?

648
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,729
Where is everyone?

649
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:28,197
Oh, did you know
it was hunting season?

650
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:34,173
Victoria, this is Gwen and Gio.

651
00:45:34,332 --> 00:45:37,176
- Hi.
- Actually, you probably know her mom.

652
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:38,905
She's friends with my mom.
They went to school together.

653
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,708
It's Olga, right?

654
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,612
Wait. Olga de Monet?

655
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:45,617
- Sadly yes.
- You'll have to come over

656
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:47,915
and spend the weekend
at our house as well.

657
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:51,026
That would be great.

658
00:45:51,182 --> 00:45:53,389
So, Gio, do you collect vinyls?

659
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:56,191
I saw you guys clear the shelves
at the record store the other day.
