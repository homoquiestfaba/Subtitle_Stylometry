1
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,703
On this hot and steamy
Fourth of July weekend...

2
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:19,037
...independence is all about the money.

3
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,943
Every grocery store, liquor store,
gas station and corner market...

4
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:24,879
...has long lines out its doors...

5
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:28,077
...as people wait to purchase their
Mondo Millions lottery tickets.

6
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:52,372
Tonight's jackpot:
a record $370 million...

7
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:55,378
... has infected this city
with lottery fever.

8
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:59,006
We asked local residents
what they'd do with all that money.

9
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00,914
I would give half the money to charity.

10
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,486
I would get drunk as hell.

11
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,783
I'd probably feed the whole world.
Enjoy life, you know.

12
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,221
I'd put it in my pocket.

13
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:08,451
I'm gonna go ski diving.

14
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,392
Hello, hello, hello. This is Mutt.

15
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,056
I quit.

16
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,706
What would you buy for yourself?

17
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,811
An all-white Versace suit.

18
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,913
Would you break up with your girlfriend?

19
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,338
Yeah.

20
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,677
I'd do the same thing I'm doing now.

21
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,842
-You wouldn't change a thing?
-Uh-uh.

22
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,648
-I'm sorry, Mom. I wanna shop.
-I'd quit selling fruit.

23
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,268
So would you split the money fifty-fifty?

24
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,736
-Yes.
-I would change everything.

25
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,170
Probably a mail-order bride.

26
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,038
-I would paint for the rest of my life.
-I would lose my mind.

27
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,611
Have more fun.

28
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,749
"Oh, my gosh! I won! Yay!"

29
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:04,941
Okay.

30
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:37,540
Damn.

31
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,446
Is that a home-cooked meal?

32
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:41,953
Yo! Miss Carson!

34
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,581
If you don't come in here
like you got sense...

35
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,350
...I'm gonna knock some into you.

36
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,360
My bad, Miss Carson. I didn't mean
to slam that door like that.

37
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,055
Is Kevin ready yet?

38
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,159
He's in his room.

39
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,995
All right. Cool.

40
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:57,931
You looking exceptionally well today.

41
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,265
What you been using,
cocoa butter and Jesus?

42
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,273
I forgot to tell you,
there's a dude that live down the street...

43
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,967
...he was almost in
The Temptations.

44
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:08,705
You should holler at him. I'm telling you,
you're single, sexy and saved.

45
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,041
Get out my face, boy.

46
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,548
Think about it.
I'm gonna take this to Kevin.

47
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,716
Now, who got more swag than me?

48
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,549
Nobody.

49
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:18,782
You ain't got no swag.

50
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,325
-Man, look at you.
-This is so good.

51
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,519
Why you always come over,
eating all my food?

52
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,093
Why you so stingy?

53
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,096
Be nice. Come on, I'm your best friend.

54
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,867
You need to eat, man.
Gotta buff up a little bit.

55
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,061
Don't put it on my bed, man.

56
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,769
Oh, my God, Kev.

57
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:38,141
-Ooh. So many smuts outside.
-What you talking about, "smuts"?

58
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,108
Dip-offs, scrapes, women.

59
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,771
And they're wearing booty shorts
up to here, looking bad.

60
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,541
That's why I gotta look fly.

61
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,316
Which brings me to my next point.
Let me rock these.

62
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,819
-Hell, no.
-Why not?

63
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,287
I can't look like this?
It's 10,000 degrees outside.

64
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,655
Look at me, man. Look how I look.
I look like a homeless thug.

65
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,557
-No. No. No.
-Fly.

66
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,858
All right, I see how it is.
I'm telling your grandmama you stingy.

67
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,264
-Grown man-- Man, be quiet.
-Miss Carson!

68
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:06,269
Thanks for breakfast, Miss Carson.
Appreciate it. Appreciate it.

69
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,805
Hey, get out the way.
All right, Grandmama.

70
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,636
I love you. I'm out.

71
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,437
You're not gonna eat your breakfast?

72
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,409
No, because I'm gonna be late
for work.

73
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,810
Oh, but you have time
to iron your shoestrings?

74
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,741
I hope the little girls
you trying to impress is worth it.

75
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,781
"Little girls"?
Don't worry, Kevin ain't getting no pu--

76
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:25,583
-Ahem.
-I mean, Kevin doesn't have a girlfriend.

77
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,222
He doesn't let these Jezebels
get near him.

78
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,623
You know the one I'd like
to see you with, huh?

79
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,425
Here we go.

80
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:34,623
Stacie.

81
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,599
Oh, she's a bright girl
and she goes to church.

82
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,905
Grandma, look, we are just friends,
all right? That's it.

83
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,098
Friends.

84
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,072
-All right, dear.
-That would be nasty.

85
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:47,012
Suit yourself.
Now, wait a minute, here.

86
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,607
I want you to play my number for me
on the way home, okay?

87
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:53,047
And don't let nobody copy them
either. All right?

88
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,652
-I won't.
-Those are my numbers.

89
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,722
I dreamt them up last night.
They're out of the Holy Scripture.

90
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,914
Okay.

91
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:03,859
You know something? Last night I dreamt
that I was waiting on the number 17 bus.

92
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,963
You'll never guess who was driving
when the bus pulled up.

93
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,896
-Who?
-Jesus.

94
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,265
And I said, "Jesus, what are
you doing driving this bus?"

95
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,302
-You know what he said to me?
-No, ma'am.

96
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:19,571
He said, "Child, it's a recession.
Times is hard."

97
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,744
-That's what he said.
-You didn't ask me...

98
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,644
...but how did Jesus get a license
without a birth certificate?

99
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,910
-It makes no sense.
-Out. Go.

100
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,020
-Gotta think about that.
-Man, get your ass--

101
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,721
Ah.

102
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,453
-Sorry, Grandma.
-Mm-hm.

103
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,817
-I love you, though. Heh, heh.
-Ha, ha.

104
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,656
Bye, baby.

105
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,695
-Tell your girlfriend, get her panties from me.
-I'm talking about Ashley.

106
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,460
-Smell that.
-Nigga, that's Shaniqua.

107
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:44,660
Ben-Ben. Ben-Ben.

108
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:45,861
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Damn.

109
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,699
What's up? Y'all ain't speaking?

110
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,273
What's up, Semaj? How you doing?

111
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,034
-What y'all up to?
-Going to work.

112
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,369
Going to work.
Going to the court, you know?

113
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,174
Sell some knickknack paddywhacks.
Give a dog a bone.

114
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,613
Why you so fidgety?
You gotta pee-pee or something?

115
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,218
-Huh?
-You gotta pee?

116
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,047
Huh? The bathroom right inside.

117
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,052
I'm just excited about going to work.

118
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:07,654
-I'm really trying to go to work.
-Let's leave.

119
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,158
-Work?
-All right, Semaj.

120
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,956
Hey, yo, you heard
about that girl Ebony?

121
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,389
Up in Building 6?

122
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,233
-That big-booty chick, right?
-Yeah, big booty.

123
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,962
-That one. Okay. Yeah.
-Oh. Big booty. Big booty. All right.

124
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,003
-She bought 50 lottery tickets.
-Fifty?

125
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,368
-Fifty?
-Fifty!

126
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,443
-Damn, are they on sale?
-I need to work where she works.

127
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,909
Hey, hold up.
Listen to what I'm trying to say.

128
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,243
Now, you all could do yourself a favor,
stay up off that court.

129
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,045
Because your boy Lorenzo Mack,
he done got out of jail.

130
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,712
-He got out?
-I seen him and his boys on that court.

131
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,790
Maybe y'all ought not
be hanging out there.

132
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,018
-Semaj, it's 9:00 in the morning.
-Yeah.

133
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,663
How in the hell do you get this gossip?

134
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,957
First of all, it's not gossip.

135
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,833
-It's information.
-All right.

136
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:51,259
Give me a haircut
when you get a chance.

137
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:54,429
You ought to get it cut right about now.
Kind of nappy in the back.

138
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,268
Damn. Let me go to work
with you today.

139
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,636
-You ain't going.
-Hell, no.

140
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,942
-Hey, young blood.
-Yo.

141
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,670
Yo, I need some beef jerky...

142
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,179
...and a Cherry Coke.

143
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,782
Yeah, that's it?

144
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,753
I guess so.

145
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,791
Man.

146
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,961
What's up? What?

147
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:20,888
Why you gotta talk to old dude?

148
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,498
You know he's crazy.

149
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,693
There ain't nothing wrong with
Mr. Washington.

150
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,496
He's a lunatic, Kevin.

151
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,799
He been in that apartment
before my mom was born.

152
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,704
He still got slave dust on him, dude.

153
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:34,476
I'm telling you, man. I think
Mr. Washington a serial killer, for real.

154
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,648
He eats beef jerky?

155
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,046
Who the hell eats beef jerky, Kevin?

156
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:43,917
Telling you, he on some mass-destruction,
Osama bin Laden-type stuff. Seriously.

157
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,224
You need to stop treating people
like that.

158
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,953
You always do that.
Since we was little, you be doing that.

159
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,619
I'm not making "rest in peace" shirts.

160
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,129
-You ain't that creative.
-Don't call me collect from heaven.

161
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,394
Now that, bitches,
is what you call a sports car, man.

162
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,970
Man, check this thing out, man.

163
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,371
Yours for the low, low price of...

164
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,636
...oof, 1.4 mil!

165
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:08,336
So that's what you would get? A car?

166
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,914
Hell, yeah. I'd get a car
with that kind of money.

167
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,483
-You simple son of a bitch. Ha, ha.
-Ha, ha, ha.

168
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,917
I'm simple, but he don't know
how to put lotion on.

169
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,022
But I'm simple, though?

170
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,750
Hey, get your ashy ass up out here, man.

171
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,258
If I won the lottery? If I won?

172
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,828
Boy, I'd get my ass
one of them helicopters.

173
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:29,263
-I'd be flying in one of them choppers.
-What, a helicopter? What the hell?

174
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,764
I hope Semaj was lying
about letting Lorenzo out.

175
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,370
He the last person I wanna see.

176
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,666
Keep the thugs in jail.
You know what I'm saying?

177
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,308
Stacie!

178
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:38,465
Hey!

179
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,872
Boy, you know you're late, right?

180
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,247
What, I'm supposed to wait
for you forever?

181
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,713
Why you always down my back?

182
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,045
You got a watch,
you act like you can't tell time.

183
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,552
Could you stop arguing? Please?
Know what I'm saying? Come down here.

184
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,350
I'll be down in a second.

185
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,551
While you sitting in bumper-to-bumper
traffic in your Brigatti--

186
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,025
-Bugatti.
-Bugatti.

187
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:00,632
Flying over that joint in all
state-of-the-art equipment...

188
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,427
... Ieather interior, GPS.

189
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,935
Even a PlayStation with
the plasma screen with a beat.

190
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:11,304
And I can't forget the feet up with
them 24-inch gold spinners on there.

191
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,499
It would kill y'all!

192
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:16,478
Nigga, you can't put rims on a helicopter.
Ain't got no damn wheels!

193
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:17,979
Broke people. Look at them.

194
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,015
What you talking about, broke?

195
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,781
There's a man that knows something.
Ask Kevin.

196
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:26,618
Tell me, if you won the lottery,
would you rather get a sports car...

197
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,259
...or would you get a helicopter?

198
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,019
I don't even play the lottery.

199
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,788
-Don't answer that.
-Why?

200
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,933
It's designed to keep poor people poor
by selling them false dreams.

201
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,466
Man, y'all know that.

202
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,729
Somebody give him a bow tie
and a bean pie.

203
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,304
-It's Obama in the house.
-What is wrong with you?

204
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,668
Are you serious?

205
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,833
You in Rainbow PUSH yourself?
Come on.

206
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,603
Martin Luther King,
can you pick one?

207
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,509
-Just pick it.
-Just one. Not rocket science.

208
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:50,706
Helicopter.

209
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,180
Oh!

210
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,818
-What?
-That's what I'm talking about.

211
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,648
Why make him think you can have
a helicopter in the projects?

212
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,290
-Can y'all clear the way?
-We're good, we're good.

213
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,789
I am very disappointed in you.

214
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,192
See, there goes chocolate drop,
chocolate drop, chocolate drop.

215
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,229
Look at you, darling. Lookie.

216
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,369
-She turn 18 yet?
-Stop it. Just stop it right now.

217
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,470
-What the hell you hit me for?
-Stop it now.

218
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,205
I'm saying you don't got a job.

219
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:15,635
-And? What--?
-I got a job.

220
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,002
-You got a job?
-Hell, yeah.

221
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,167
Benny, please.
You ain't got no daggone job.

222
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,228
God.

223
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,133
I told you the smuts was out today.

224
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,297
You need to holler at Nikki Swayze
before I do.

225
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,376
-Are y'all coming or what?
-What am I gonna say to Nikki?

226
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,412
I don't know. Ask her for her
Social Security number or something.

227
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,206
-It's your chance.
-All right.

228
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,244
Get it.

229
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,853
Hey. Um....

230
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,255
Nikki.

231
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,896
Hey, um, look. Ahem. Nice dog.

232
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,934
I was just wondering if, like...

233
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,365
...you wasn't doing nothing--

234
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,506
Hello? So now we gotta be late to work
just so he could talk to her?

235
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,868
Yep. Stop hating.

236
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,369
Well, I saw you during graduation.

237
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,205
You might not have saw me.

238
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,405
Because I was sitting in the back.
You know? But I was there.

239
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,381
-You always got me, Stacie.
-You know what? What the hell?

240
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,452
-But I was--
-Do me a favor, Devin?

241
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,780
-Yeah. What you need?
-Throw that away.

243
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,420
Thanks, Devin.

244
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,294
It's-- It's Kevin.

245
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,696
-What's up, baby?
-Hey, how you doing?

246
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,427
Get in the car, baby.

247
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,299
-Come on, girl.
-She gave you doo-doo.

248
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,566
You were supposed to get
the number, not doo-doo.

249
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,742
What's up, now?

250
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,903
Why they keep looking at us like that?
Your baby cousins?

251
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,144
They, like, the same size. That's so cute.

252
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:08,514
K-Ci and JoJo. Hey, man, you can't
get no girl in no Foot Locker shirt.

253
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:09,813
Ooh, yeah

254
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,655
Hey.

255
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,524
Go make the 'hood look good.

256
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,092
Hey, I wear size 12.

257
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:24,999
See, man, she likes this corny-ass Giovanni.
This corny ass.

258
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,038
Dog, there go Lorenzo.

259
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:30,073
-Don't even look at him. Just keep walking.
-All right.

260
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,472
Ain't no thing, we got places to go.

261
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,874
Get your bitch ass over here, slim.

262
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,608
And bring Mr. Foot Locker with you.

263
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:42,185
-I think he saw me.
-Because you looked at him.

264
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,652
-Y'all don't have to go over there.
-Come on, man.

265
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,314
Damn.

266
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,128
What's up, Lorenzo?
How was your vacation?

267
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,496
They got cell phones in prison now.
You should've hit me up.

268
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,631
You know what I'd do to
a bitch like you in my "cellie"?

269
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,635
Huh?

270
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,108
Huh?

271
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,011
I'll make you snuggle up with me
at night.

272
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,274
And I'll squeeze you.

273
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,008
I squeeze you.

274
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:14,445
I squeeze you.

275
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,020
And I squeeze you!

277
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,988
Next time, it's your rib cage.
You feel me?

278
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,191
All right, let's go.

279
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,336
-I'm sorry.
-Bring your ass, let's go.

280
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:32,663
Hey, Foot Locker.

281
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,974
-What's up?
-When them new Jordans drop?

282
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:44,547
-They dropped Wednesday. What's good?
-Oh, word?

283
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,511
-Yeah.
-All right.

284
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,084
Hook us up with three pairs.

285
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:51,012
-Each.
-"Each"?

286
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,658
We'll be by later to pick them up.

287
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,390
Hook you up?

288
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,428
-As in, like, hook you up?
-Just spit it out, Rain Man. What?

289
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,588
-You buying them?
-lf I was gonna buy them...

290
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:01,960
...what I need you for?

291
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,863
He got you. Don't worry about that.

292
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,197
Yo, think before you speak. Okay?

293
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,129
I blame the school systems, really.

294
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,673
No child left behind?
You left behind, Negro.

295
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,375
Close your mouth.

296
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:15,035
-We got all the shoes you need.
-Get off the court.

297
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,680
-We out.
-We got him.

298
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,874
"We"? Dude, that's me.

299
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,076
You don't work at Foot Locker, nigga.

300
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,187
Where my ball at?

301
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:27,950
You just got me killed.

302
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:31,426
You might as well grab the gun,
put it to my head and pull the trigger.

303
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,428
It's too hot to be picking up some shoes.

304
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,591
Lorenzo's a bitch.
He ain't gonna pick up them shoes.

305
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,135
-Free Jordans?
-Oh, yeah, you're right.

306
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,396
And you, you lucky.

307
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:43,006
You get to go off to college
while we're stuck here.

308
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,369
You know what? Don't start.

309
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,977
Man, you need to speak for yourself, bro.
I'll be rich.

310
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,273
I have my business plans
plotted out right now.

311
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,508
You could still apply to design school
if you really wanted to, Kevin.

312
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,778
Yeah, I can,
but design school costs money.

313
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,320
Besides, if I go,
who gonna watch my grandmother?

314
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,923
Other than Jesus, I'm all she got.

315
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,751
And right now Jesus ain't
paying the rent. Straight up.

316
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,453
He ain't gonna show up, Kev.

317
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,330
Fourteen minutes and 32 seconds late
there, Kevin.

318
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,699
That's coming out of your paycheck.
Heh, heh.

319
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,400
Yeah, I figured that.

320
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,635
For someone who has his aspirations
on being assistant manager...

321
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,143
...you're not showing me much.

322
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,747
There's more to the job
than just knowing about shoes.

323
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,173
Remember that.

324
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,884
-Man.
-You like what you see?

325
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,022
Man, them joints is crazy.

326
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,715
-How much are those?
-About 5000.

327
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,190
-Five thousand what? Dollars?
-Yep.

328
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,262
You gotta be kidding me.
For some sneakers?

329
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,523
Hold on. They're not just sneakers.

330
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,361
These are Clark Kent limited-edition
Air Force 1s.

331
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,025
The mesh, that's all original.

332
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,968
From the original Air Force Highs
that dropped in 1982.

333
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,769
Look at the elephant print
from the original Retro Jordan III's.

334
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:54,105
Yeah, he put up big numbers
against Bird in those.

335
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,042
I'll get them one day.

336
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:58,982
Man, they're just shoes.

337
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,585
Yeah, all right. Well, maybe to you...

338
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:02,778
...but not to me.

339
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:10,986
Can I get some help?

340
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,596
Can somebody help me, please?

341
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,960
-Can somebody service this customer?
-I can, sir.

342
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,202
I can service you, sir. How--? Um....
What can I do you for? Heh, heh, heh.

343
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,163
Not you.

344
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,200
Him.

345
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,276
-No.
-Uh, Kevin?

346
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,241
Come here.

347
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,578
Be right with you.

348
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,548
Keep your eye on them.
They look like riffraff.

349
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,952
Man, you have no idea.

350
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,053
Fellas, what can I help y'all with?
Y'all want the T-shirt?

351
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,660
Shut up.

352
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,834
Give me some 12s, some 13s, all right?

353
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,029
Black joints with the swoosh on the side.

354
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:57,937
And I know they got them because I called
to make sure when they was in stock.

355
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,837
Usually I work the register. I didn't--

356
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,844
Will you go get the shoes? Chop-chop.

358
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,282
Hey, check it out, man.

359
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,186
If those don't fit, there's another
Foot Locker you can go to.

360
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,020
-No, they fit.
-All right.

361
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,890
You know, when I was a kid...

362
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,095
... if I wanted some new pairs of shoes...

363
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,098
...used to have to steal them
off niggas' feet. Just rob them.

364
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,366
But thanks to you,
we got new shoes fresh out the box.

365
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,732
That's love, man.

366
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,606
-Got it.
-So how much I owe you?

367
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,237
You gonna pay?

368
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:36,776
Tsh.

369
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,209
Don't you know crime don't pay?

370
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,319
You stupid.

371
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,455
Hey, man, y'all want no socks?
No bag? All right.

372
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,185
Just walk right out the store.

373
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:50,726
-Carry them all like that.
-Where you going?

375
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,095
You little bitch!

376
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,596
Yo, no, I didn't do nothing!

377
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:58,895
Yeah, I know that.

378
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,430
Part of what you didn't do
is pay for the shoes.

379
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,303
Yo, yo, he gave them to us. Ask him.

380
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,569
Ask that brother there.
He said it was a gift.

381
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,170
Is that true?

382
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,606
Um....

383
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,952
Well, did you or did you not?

385
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:21,156
No. I didn't.

386
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,521
Let's go.

387
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,363
You're a dead man. You hear me?
You're a dead man!

388
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,805
Wait a minute. He fired you for that?

389
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:38,966
Yes. Right on the spot.

390
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,338
He didn't even hesitate.

391
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:44,438
-Kevin, I'm so sorry.
-Look, I mean, it is what it is.

392
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,084
I mean, who cares?

393
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:52,189
Like.... It's fine.

394
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,287
What's it say?

395
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,128
-Some nonsense.
-What?

396
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,766
-Don't do that, it's bad luck.
-It don't even matter.

397
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:03,592
You're right.

398
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,128
I don't wanna spoil all the good luck
I've been having.

399
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:10,139
You know what? Just take it, okay?

400
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,038
Come on, Stacie.

401
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:16,605
And eat your food.

402
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:21,116
You can lean in the window a bit
more next time. Don't be scared of me.

403
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,151
And here you go. Appreciate it.

404
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,483
I can transform you

405
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:28,251
-Kev. What's happening?
-You tell me.

406
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:29,689
You came for the lottery too?

407
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,226
-You stood in that line?
-Yup.

408
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,796
-The machine just broke.
-What do you mean, it broke?

409
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,194
I just broke the machine.

410
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:39,197
I'm joking. I know your mama
would beat the black off you.

411
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,134
You gotta come and play them numbers.

412
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,399
-How many tickets you need?
-I just need one.

413
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,401
-Just one?
-Yeah, just one.

414
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,169
Ring me up for this Cherry Coke.

415
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,371
And let me get two beef jerkys.

416
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,108
Nasty combination.
Sure you wanna do that to your stomach?

417
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:55,175
And, yeah, play those numbers for me.

418
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,512
Give me this, give me this, give me this.

419
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:58,847
Here you go.

420
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,523
-All right.
-Enjoy this.

421
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,987
You sure you don't want one
for yourself?

422
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,354
Three hundred and seventy million.

423
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,998
No, man, that's not me. I don't really
do that whole lottery thing, man.

424
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:14,696
Three hundred-seventy million.
You can't be too cool for that.

425
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,635
Ticket?

426
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,441
-All right.
-Do it. There we go.

427
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,011
Give me some numbers.
I need numbers, I need numbers.

428
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,273
I wasn't, but....

429
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,940
People rushing me like I'm
taking a long time. Here you--

430
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,316
Oh, and then you pull out
the fortune cookie. Okay, that's cool.

431
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:31,979
Get your chang-wang numbers.

432
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,887
If you win, you gonna put the money
in that hole in your shirt?

433
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,550
That what you gonna do? Walk safely.

435
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,154
Watch out for the people.

436
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,299
You gonna come here
and ruin everybody day?

437
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,732
Your vibe is just ignorance today.

438
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,471
That's how you spell ignorance: Y-O-U.

439
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,602
-Come on.
-Your house, right now.

440
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:57,476
Hold on. Oh, hold on.
Yo, Kevin. Kevin. Kev!

441
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:00,810
Yo, Kevin, man, you okay? You cool?

442
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,010
Yeah, man, what's up?

443
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,917
I heard what happened with Lorenzo.
The neighborhood's talking.

444
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,820
What you mean, they're--?
Weren't nobody even there.

445
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,894
They said you set him up
and you snitched on him to the cops.

446
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:14,123
-Why'd you snitch on him?
-I ain't snit--

447
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,699
-Everybody think I'm snitching?
-That's what they said.

448
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,832
Man. Damn!

449
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,970
Yeah, damn.

450
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,408
Shake it off, you can find another job.

452
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:29,645
What up, bitches?

453
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:32,841
Who you calling "bitch"?
I'll beat your ass, man.

454
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,249
I don't play that voodoo shit.
You better get up out of here with that.

455
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:37,718
Snitch!

457
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,655
-You just could not wait.
-Come on.

458
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:45,695
Y'all know I ain't no snitch.
When you ever heard me snitching?

459
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,297
Today.

460
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,297
This nigga about to get killed.

461
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,163
Yo.

462
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,205
I got everything for--

463
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:01,139
Man, not even a "thank you."

464
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,448
-Kevin?
-Yes?

465
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:04,946
Oh.

466
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:07,108
Thank God.

467
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,010
I was so worried.

468
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,318
Let me look at your face.
Are you all right?

469
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,653
I'm okay. How'd you even hear about it?

470
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:19,091
Semaj came over.
Borrowed some toilet tissue.

471
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:22,690
Here you go.
I played your numbers for you.

472
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,064
What you gonna do?

473
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,704
Well, I just wanna go to bed.

475
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,680
-Good evening, I'm Bonnie Berry.
-Hey, Miss Bonnie.

476
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:46,722
Here's tonight's Mondo Millions
drawing for a jackpot of $370 million.

477
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:47,984
Come on, Jesus.

478
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,095
To win, all you have to do
is match all five white balls...

479
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,422
...plus the Mondo Ball.

480
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,531
-A whole lot of Mondo.
-Let's get started.

481
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:57,691
We gotta get it. Come on.
Seventeen. Seventeen.

482
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,201
The first number is...

483
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,330
...42.

484
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:05,670
Forty-stinking-two?
I ain't got no 42.

485
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,404
Oh, damn, damn, damn!

486
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,070
Forty-five.

487
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:25,022
I'm standing with
the owner of Junior's Market...

488
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:28,394
...where last night's winning
Mondo Millions jackpot ticket was sold.

489
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,591
Oh, Lord Jesus.

490
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:32,293
We understand the winner
hasn't come forward yet?

491
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,907
That's right. No, they have not.
The thing is, it's killing me...

492
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:40,109
...because I'm supposed to get
$10,000 just for selling the ticket...

493
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:41,711
...you know what I'm saying?

494
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,508
If you're out there watching
and got the winning ticket...

495
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:47,584
...holler at your boy Junior, man.
Daddy got bills to pay, baby.

496
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:50,983
Talking about he got bills to pay?
We all got bills to pay, huh?

497
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,125
-Also, I wanna shoutout--
-Whoever does have that ticket....

498
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:59,389
--a piece of paper worth $370 million.

499
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:01,265
And just in case you missed it...

500
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,958
...here's another look
at the winning numbers.

501
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:06,126
The first winning number is 42.

502
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,135
That ain't nowhere near 17.

503
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:09,933
Followed by 33.

504
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,404
Next we have four.

505
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,606
And 32 and 45.

506
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:22,747
And the all-important Mondo Ball
number is Number 21.

507
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:27,692
Experts say the chances of winning
is 1 in 175 million.

508
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:29,953
-Grandma.
-You okay, boy?

509
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,762
-Get money.
-Hey.

510
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:33,822
We won the lottery.

511
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,367
Ah. Now, come on, Kevin.

512
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,935
No, no. Grandma, look.
Grandma, we won the lottery!

513
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:42,665
Now, let me see here.
Four, 32, 33...

514
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,604
-...42--
-Forty-five!

515
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:47,040
-Twenty-one!
-You got all six numbers.

516
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,304
-Yes. We won.
-Oh!

518
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,474
Grandma!

519
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,315
Grandma, we won!

520
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,924
Ooh! Ooh!

522
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,720
Oh, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!

523
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,826
Just wonderful!

524
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,035
-Oh. Oh.
-Jesus!

525
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:13,227
I gotta call somebody!

526
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:15,668
Call? No! No! Don't! No!

527
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,505
No. Don't you--

528
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,475
No. You can't call people.

529
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:24,842
Look, you gotta keep this between us.

530
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,847
Nobody can know about this, all right?

531
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,246
-Only me and you know.
-Okay.

532
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,353
-That's it. You have to promise me.
-Okay, okay, I promise.

533
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,957
-I just got all excited.
-Oh, shit.

534
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,320
Wait. I can't say "shit"
in my grandmother's house.

535
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,121
-Oh, you sure can't.
-I'm sorry.

536
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,895
-Oh, Lord. Lord.
-Okay. Okay, Grandma.

537
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,192
Settle down, Grandma.

538
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:46,098
I just need to go down to Junior's
and figure out how to turn this ticket in.

539
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,330
No! Don't you leave that house
with this ticket.

540
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,770
-And why?
-Well, what if somebody was to--?

541
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,170
What if you was to get--?

542
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:53,936
-Oh, Lord Jesus. Child.
-What?

543
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,542
Spit it out.

544
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,341
I never thought I'd have to use this.

545
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:58,846
-You got a pistol?
-Wait on it.

546
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,041
Grandma, no!

547
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,686
-What is it, then?
-Holy water. From the Catholic church.

548
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:06,114
-Grandma!
-The Lord here! Be with you!

549
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,054
-Because the Lord is with me!
-It's cold.

550
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:09,625
What you doing?

551
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,092
Here. No!

552
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:13,560
-Grandma.
-I'm sorry, baby.

553
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:17,793
Look, I just wanna go outside
and just go down to Junior's...

554
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,870
-...and just get some information.
-Okay, then. All right.

555
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,973
Nobody knows about this ticket.

556
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,166
I ain't telling nobody.
I wouldn't tell nobody.

557
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:26,708
-You promise?
-I promise.

558
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:28,743
Only me and you know this, now.

559
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:30,278
I could be asleep right now.

560
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:32,109
-Just thank God you woke up.
-Whatever.

561
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:34,751
That's so cliché to say that.
I wanna go to sleep.

562
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,716
-Whatever.
-My job is to sleep in.

563
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,319
-Damn.
-Damn, she's fine.

564
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,387
-You wish you'd get a girl like that.
-Finer than you.

565
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,222
Yeah, good luck. Ha, ha.

566
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,233
This is the same white dude
poking holes in your condoms.

567
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:52,234
-Give me a second, I'll be right back.
-Excuse me, fellas.

568
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,304
Don't steal nothing.

569
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,473
Slow the beat down and feel it like that

570
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,836
Hey, man. Let me talk to you
real quick, all right?

571
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,705
-What?
-Talk to me through this window?

572
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:01,937
Get your ass over there.

573
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:04,604
-What's the difference?
-I don't know, let's go.

574
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,248
-Look, man, quick question.
-Mm.

575
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,909
Right, say it's the person,
whoever wins the ticket.

576
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,679
-They come here to claim it.
-Right.

577
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,449
How does that work?
You write a check for the whole amount?

578
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:18,588
Okay, so you saying that
I got $370 million in here.

579
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:22,324
That's.... I don't have that.
I can write you a check for $600...

580
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,561
...and then you gotta take the Mondo
Millions ticket to the lottery district office.

581
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:27,762
Where's that? Upstate?

582
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:31,008
No, it's downtown.
It's where I get all the tickets from.

583
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,474
Downtown. Come on.

584
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,069
Fix your dreads.

585
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:36,471
Yeah.

586
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,115
You need to steal some Tic Tacs.

587
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,744
Kevin.

588
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:46,080
Let me ask you a question.
Why you acting all suspicious and whatnot?

589
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:48,589
Me? What? I'm not acting suspicious.

590
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,455
I'm just excited.

591
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:52,858
Beep, beep, beep. What?
What are you talking about?

592
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,692
Oh, man.

593
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,405
"Violence Erupts in Downtown."

594
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,976
-No.
-That's great.

595
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,372
Nosy.

596
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,598
-Oh, shi--
-Shut up.

597
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,031
Sit down. See?
That's why I didn't--

598
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:33,329
I'm sorry, ma'am.

599
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:36,100
I'm sorry, sir.

600
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,572
If I move my hands off your mouth,
will you be quiet?

601
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,472
-You won't say a word?
-Mm.

602
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,344
Give me that.

603
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,541
Man.

604
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,912
-Act normal, sit up.
-You act normal. You sit up.

605
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:51,578
-Don't be telling me what to do.
-Don't tell me what to do.

606
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,484
-Kevin.
-What?

607
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,629
-If this is real, right?
-Right.

608
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,731
-Do you know who you are?
-Right. I know.

609
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,457
You like the Moses of the projects.

610
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,157
-Look, no more WIC cards.
-Right.

611
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,166
-You could take Grandma to Vegas.
-Vegas.

612
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:07,599
-Buy her a castle.
-Castle.

613
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:10,605
You could take your girl to Venus
and still have money left over.

614
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,744
Look, the sooner I turn the ticket in,
the safer I'm gonna feel.

615
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,645
It's on. Come on.

616
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,986
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Let's get this money.

617
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,458
I can really smell the money.

618
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,427
-What's up, man?
-My man?

619
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,122
-Ahem.
-Quit mopping for one second.

620
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,328
-This is the lottery district office, right?
-Mm-hm.

621
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,998
-Cool.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey.

622
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,969
Where everybody at?
Everybody at lunch?

623
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,836
-Yeah. Where--?
-Closed.

624
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,499
-Closed?
-Closed.

625
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,407
-What you mean?
-What you talking about?

626
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,945
For the Fourth of July.

627
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:51,911
Be open again Tuesday, 9 a.m.

628
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:53,944
-Tues--?
-I hate Fourth of July.

629
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:55,779
Man, that's three whole days.

630
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,979
Know how much shit can happen
in three days?

631
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,418
Let's just think about this.

632
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,082
Me, you and your grandma
are the only ones who know.

633
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,956
If they knew back home,
you'd have already been shot.

634
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:06,653
-Am I right?
-Yeah, but--

635
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:08,765
You're making this sound real easy
right now.

636
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:11,424
Come on, Kevin.
You tell me, what can go wrong?

638
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:14,961
Oh, happy day

639
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,130
Drop it like it's hot for Jesus!

640
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:21,573
-Oh, happy day
-Oh, happy day

641
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,540
I dropped it like it was hot! Ha, ha, ha.

643
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:29,014
Jesus Christ

645
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,688
-I'm sorry.
-What was that? You scared me.

646
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,883
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

647
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,255
I just was walking by,
I heard all the noise.

648
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:42,155
-What's all the celebrating about?
-No, no celebrating.

649
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,791
I ain't seen you this happy since you
found out shrimp went to 2.99 a pound.

650
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,631
What you doing? Having a fish fry?

651
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:49,636
No.

652
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,737
I don't smell nothing. What's going on?

653
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,571
-What you got?
-I can't say nothing.

654
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,077
-What's that behind your back?
-I can't say nothing.

655
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:59,214
-Come on, you can tell me. You can tell me.
-No.

656
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:00,408
Come on, come on.

657
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:04,253
You know, most of the drug dealers,
like the big ones, shit, the bosses...

658
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,514
...they weigh they money.

659
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,158
-Because they can't count it.
-I heard about that. Right.

660
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:10,487
Man. Somebody stole from them,
they'd know.

661
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:13,495
-"They tried to steal my money!"
-Stop, stop, stop.

662
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:14,996
You gonna be a boss, son.

663
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,066
-Stop. Damn.
-Oh, my gosh.

664
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:19,328
I wonder, does Oprah weigh her money?

665
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,369
-Kevin, where everybody at?
-Good question.

666
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,473
Hey, little man, where everybody at?

667
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:24,665
Oh, you don't know.

668
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:26,867
-Let's spring to my crib real quick.
-Yeah.

669
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:32,207
-Whoa.
-There he is. There he is right there.

671
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,312
-Grandma?
-I'm here, baby.

672
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:39,217
Get out the way! Move out the way!

673
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,290
Y'all move away from here!

674
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,757
Grandma. What's up?
You called everybody?

675
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:47,227
I ain't called nobody.
I ain't called nobody.

676
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,159
Semaj, he come over here. Then he goes out
and come backs with all these people.

677
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:54,271
Hey, come on, Kev, let's go
to the strip club. Make it rain!

678
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,235
-I just wanna touch it. I just wanna touch it.
-Touch what?

679
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:58,807
You ain't gonna touch shit.

680
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,003
I know your daddy. He still owe me
money from a craps game in '89.

681
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,307
-You gotta help pay--
-My medical insurance.

682
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:05,710
Damn your medical insurance.

683
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:08,147
Yo, Kevin, I got an investment idea
that can't miss.

684
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,981
Two words, man: massage toilet.

685
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,952
Now, all I need is the money.

687
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,128
Go!

688
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,370
Come on!

689
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:31,732
Come on! Go, go, go!

690
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:33,436
Come on!

691
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:34,900
Shit!

692
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,706
All right, your crib! Come on!

693
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,911
Kevin!

694
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,078
Come on, my window,
my window, my window!

695
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,383
Come on. Go, go!

696
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:54,523
-Where'd he go?
-Kevin!

697
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,768
Dude. Ain't no way.

698
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:05,466
Ain't no way I'm making it
to Tuesday, dog. Uh-uh.

699
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:08,804
Damn.

700
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:17,281
Kevin. Get up. I got a plan.

701
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:22,886
This here is what we call
the underground railroad, Kevin.

702
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,326
Many slaves have used this to escape.

703
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:27,794
We can escape, Kevin.

704
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:29,398
We can get out the 'hood, right?

705
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,592
We go through lndiana,
go through Michigan.

706
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:33,828
Harriet Tubman did it.
We follow the North Star.

707
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,405
-No.
-Then we sing Negro spirituals.

708
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,304
I always wanted to sing Negro spirituals.
Let me live my dream.

709
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:42,469
We leak that, right?
Turn it into a mix tape, right?

710
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:44,672
A mix tape of Negro spirituals. Let's go!

711
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,111
No.

713
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:50,351
What's wrong with you?

714
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:52,682
Man, get off the floor.

715
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,722
The money's in my head.

716
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:57,122
-Three hundred-seventy million.
-Just listen.

717
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,489
Listen!

718
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:02,258
Look, all we need is something simple.
That's it, something simple.

719
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,662
We'll just pretend like
the ticket's a fake, then.

720
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,565
Ticket's a fake!

721
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,500
That's it. That's it.

722
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,300
-You could say you made it up.
-Right.

723
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:12,670
-Hell, yeah. They already think you a snitch.
-Yes!

724
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,505
They'll think you a snitch and a liar.

725
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,579
Stick to the plan.
The ticket is fake, okay?

726
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,307
Remember when Steve Harvey had hair?
It was what? Fake.

727
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,042
Kim Kardashian's ass is what?

728
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,846
-Fake. Everything, fake.
-There we go.

729
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,385
Kevin!

730
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:28,915
Back up. Back up. Everybody back up.

731
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:32,187
Back up, little mama.
That go for you too, James.

732
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,887
My name is Semaj. "Back up"?

733
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:35,089
Nigga, your name James.

734
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:38,531
Just because you spell it backwards
don't make it different. It's James.

735
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,534
Better move your hair-cutting ass back.

736
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:47,169
-No problem, bro.
-And that go for everybody else out here.

737
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:49,939
Y'all better start showing this man
some respect...

738
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:52,708
...and quit running around
acting like wild-ass animals.

739
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,716
-Thank you.
-Like the way I handled that?

740
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,611
We was thinking that you need,
like, a entourage, yo.

741
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,587
Hell, yeah.
Hey, Kev, anything you want, man.

742
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,989
-Hey, you ever seen my little sister lately?
-No.

743
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,928
-Nigga, she real cute and I hear she a freak.
-Ho.

744
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:11,591
Hey, Tanisha! Operation Lay Down
With a Millionaire is in effect.

745
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:13,066
Everybody listen!

746
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,228
Kevin! Kevin! Kevin!

747
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:17,897
-Wait, wait, wait.
-We love you, Kevin.

748
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:19,337
I wanna have your baby.

749
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,808
I been trying to get you pregnant
for the longest.

750
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,810
I know your mama.

752
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:31,214
Look, just the other day
everybody thought I was a snitch.

753
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:32,879
But the other day you wasn't rich.

754
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:35,423
-So, what you want me to do?
-I say you roll with it.

755
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:41,491
You hear that? "Kevin. Kevin. Kevin."

756
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:47,063
All right, everybody.
Everybody, please, please, please.

757
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,135
What I was trying to say...

758
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:51,871
...was that, Fillmore,
we on now, baby!

760
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:58,980
I'm gonna get a jet!

761
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,141
I'm gonna get a jet!

762
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,017
I'm gonna get a jet!

763
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,181
-Kevin, I just heard. I just heard.
-Hey, hey.

764
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:12,853
Hold up. You just can't be running up
on Mr. Carson like that these days.

765
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,225
Man, what you doing?
Pointing a gun at Stacie?

766
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,333
You know we love Stacie.

767
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:18,900
No. Y'all wrong.

768
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,261
Stop. Stop. Stop.

769
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,872
I'm just saying, she might have something.

770
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,838
-What is all of this?
-What?

771
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:27,610
My entourage?

772
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,707
Look, it's just for protection.

773
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:33,673
Half these cats out here trying to kill me,
you know that.

774
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:36,911
-True.
-Hey, look. Forget that.

775
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,489
You know where I got the numbers?

776
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:41,750
-Where?
-That fortune cookie from your job.

777
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,518
-You're lying.
-No, I swear to God.

778
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:44,991
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

779
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:49,364
Boy, how you gonna win off my fortune
cookie and not tell me? Where is my cut?

780
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,433
Your cut? You don't be hooking me up.

781
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:54,867
-When I come over and I get the kung pao--
-I hook you up all the time.

782
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,063
Yeah, with the sample.

784
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:00,837
You don't even have to go
to design school.

785
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,543
You could start your own shoe company.

786
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:05,675
Yeah, I guess I could.

787
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:10,077
That is all you been talking about
since you were 9 years old. This is it, Kevin.

788
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:14,755
-You okay?
-Yeah, just....

789
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:15,949
I mean....

790
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:22,223
Man, I don't know, Stacie. Man, it's a lot.
It's a lot. I'm not even gonna lie to you.

791
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,528
I know, but trust me, I got you.
You're good.

792
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,728
-Oh. I'm worried now.
-Okay? You know.

793
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:28,894
Hey, Kevin.

794
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,568
Hi.

795
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:39,338
Hold on.

796
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,310
Okay.

797
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,249
-What's up, Nikki?
-I owe you an apology.

798
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:49,387
I was so rude to you yesterday
and I been feeling horrible ever since.

799
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,118
Look, it's cool.

800
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:52,819
You know, I understand.

801
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,624
-I ain't tripping. It's all good.
-No.

802
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:56,892
I don't think you do, Kevin.

803
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:59,559
I've always thought
that you were so fine.

804
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:03,036
Yesterday, when you came up to me,
I guess I just didn't know what to say.

805
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:04,196
What?

806
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:05,535
Wow. Heh.

807
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,937
I was hoping maybe you'd give me
a chance to make it up.

808
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,580
Are you busy tonight?

809
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,113
Hell, no, he ain't.

810
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:14,308
Good.

811
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:17,511
My mother's gonna be gone.
Maybe we can go out somewhere...

812
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:20,987
...and then later you can come back
and keep me company.

813
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:22,850
You'll let me do that?

814
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,451
I-- I mean--

815
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:27,928
Cool. Yeah, we can--

816
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,759
I promise, Kevin, you will never, ever...

818
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,904
...ever forget tonight.

819
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,807
See you later.

820
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:44,106
Later, if you want, you can
leave your panties at my house.

821
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,305
My house.

822
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:47,781
Damn, Kev. Did she touch your face?

823
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,313
Yeah, and my stomach.

824
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,183
That ass is priceless!

825
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:56,182
That's what you like?
That's what you like?

826
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,692
Please tell me you did not
just fall for that.

827
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,524
That bitch is beyond trifling.

828
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,529
-Come on, Stacie.
-I smell jealousy.

829
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,227
-Jealousy is in the air.
-No, no, no. It is so obvious.

830
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,872
Only reason she came over,
she heard about your ticket.

831
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,939
Wait. You saying my boy
ain't good enough...

832
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,235
...to get a girl like Nikki Swayze
without money?

833
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,972
No. What I'm saying is yesterday
she handed you a bag of shit, right?

834
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:20,311
Today, suddenly she wants to screw you.
Is that a coincidence?

835
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:21,709
Come on.

836
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:24,650
-Whatever. Do what you wanna do.
-Stace, don't be like that.

837
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:26,949
-Stacie just being Stacie, man.
-I ain't got time for this.

838
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,649
You need to be thinking about
where you gonna take Nikki.

839
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:32,193
-Already got it covered.
-She gonna bring her friends?

840
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,729
-I already got the spot.
-Okay, where we going?

841
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,032
-Y'all ready?
-Yeah.

842
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:39,101
I'm gonna take her
to that new Waffle House.

843
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,862
-No, man.
-Goddamn Waffle House!

844
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:44,030
You can't take her there.
Not no ghetto spot, man. You a baller now.

845
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,108
You gotta take her to a place like, um....

846
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,904
-What's that joint called?
-Dolce.

847
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:49,670
Dolce Vittoria.

848
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:52,475
Hey, dog.
That's where all the rich people go, man.

849
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:56,245
Y'all forgetting, I ain't got no money.
I'm just as broke now as I was yesterday.

850
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,287
I can't get that money until
I turn in that ticket. You know that.

851
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,391
-That's true, yeah.
-Oh, you need money?

852
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,720
If you need money,
I can get you some money.

853
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:05,486
How are you gonna get me some money?

854
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:07,563
Man, I know a dude
that got stacks of money.

855
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:10,097
I mean, he got packs of money.

856
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,201
-Racks of money.
-Y'all vouch for him?

857
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:13,597
What? That's our boy.

858
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,568
Let's go get this stimulus package,
nigga.

859
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,535
I told y'all I knew where
to get the money from.

860
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:22,838
I know Sweet Tee and them
for years.

861
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:25,538
I know all his brothers and everybody.

862
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:28,512
What's up, Jimmy?

863
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:33,046
-You, you. Come on.
-Huh?

864
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:34,486
Come on.

865
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,286
-This your boy?
-Yeah.

866
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,692
This better not be no bullshit, man.

867
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,691
Did I stutter?

868
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:47,933
-What's up, Jimmy?
-Get off the steps.

869
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,505
-Hold on, big man.
-Broke-ass Cosby kids.

870
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,040
Man, tell Sweet Tee I here, Jimmy.

871
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:57,180
-Jimmy. Jimmy.
-This supposed to be your hookup.

872
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,215
Jimmy always be playing like this.
He like the practical-- Jimmy!

873
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,477
-He don't know you.
-Open the door, man.

874
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:05,051
Jimmy, you crazy as hell, man.

875
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:08,385
You got me this time, Jimmy. Jimmy!

876
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:13,155
Hey, look, if you need me for anything,
I'll be out here chilling.

877
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,762
Hey, fellas. Over here.

878
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:31,709
-Do you know who I am?
-Yeah, I heard of you before.

879
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,543
What have you heard about me?

880
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,947
You know, just stuff like how...

881
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,887
...you're like the Godfather
of the projects. Stuff like that.

882
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:45,624
Well, to my friends I go by Sweet Tee.

883
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,123
And I'd like very much to be
your friend, Kevin.

884
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:52,767
First of all, let me say congratulations
on your newfound wealth.

885
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:57,101
It's always a wonderful feeling
when you make your first few million.

886
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:00,874
I'd also like you to accept this loan
as a token of my friendship.

887
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:06,611
Yeah. Just think of it
as a little business loan.

888
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,242
-How much money is this?
-A hundred G.

889
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,014
I figure that's enough for you boys
to have a good time...

890
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:13,884
...and a special night with your girl.

891
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,218
Look, Mr. Tee....

892
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:16,916
Sweet Tee.

893
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:20,630
Right. Sorry about that. Sweet Tee.

894
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:23,790
Look, I really do appreciate it...

895
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:25,094
...but I can't take this.

896
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:27,933
Are you refusing my friendship?

897
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,299
No.

898
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:32,237
No. No. Not at all.

899
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:34,639
Oh, go on, take that money
and enjoy yourself.

900
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:36,836
This here is Jimmy the Driver.

901
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,409
Now, he's gonna be your chaperone
for the weekend.

902
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:43,815
Now, just to make sure that there
are no problems, you understand?

903
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:45,012
Um....

904
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:47,783
Tee, can I talk to you for a minute, sir?

905
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,119
-Excuse me.
-Please.

906
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,358
Why are you doing this to me, man?

907
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:55,760
You didn't tell me I had to babysit
Bébé's Kids the whole damn weekend.

908
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:57,628
Laquita got her stitches out, come on.

909
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,928
You just make sure
nothing happens to this kid...

910
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:03,596
...or you'll be parking cars
back at the strip club, you get it?

911
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,069
That is, if it's okay with you guys.

912
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:08,935
Deal?

913
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:14,174
-All right.
-There you go.

915
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:17,977
I like that.

916
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:26,323
Just do it.

917
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,357
There go that boy.

918
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:39,568
Oh, okay, I see how it is, Kevin.

919
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,728
You come in with your crew,
you gonna jump me?

920
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:44,504
-What is he talking about?
-I'm not afraid.

921
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:49,078
-I'm from a little town called Whup-Ass.
-Maybe you heard of my hometown.

922
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,313
I'm from the Wish-A-Nigga-Woulds.

923
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,473
Yeah. You ever been there?

924
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,413
-Weather is awesome.
-Carl.

925
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:57,478
-Hey. How are you?
-What's up, man?

926
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:58,746
-Everything good?
-Good.

927
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,584
-We're gonna do a little shopping today.
-All right.

928
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,090
Let me see.

929
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,127
I'm gonna take everything on this wall.
Yeah, everything.

930
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:07,963
And everything on this one too.

931
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:10,066
A couple size 10s.
What, you 10 and a half?

932
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:13,203
-Ten and a half.
-And.... Oh, yeah.

933
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,932
-I'm taking them home with me too.
-Seriously?

934
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,597
Oh, I'm dead serious.

935
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:21,040
Yeah, right, Kevin.

936
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,571
How you gonna afford that?
You rob a bank?

937
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:26,181
-Benny.
-Look, Doug, that's the boss.

938
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,841
You disrespect him, you disrespect me.

939
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:30,350
Now get us some shoes...

940
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:31,779
...bitch.

941
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:34,122
-Make it rain!
-Let's go.

942
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,259
Let's do it. Shopping on me.

943
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:39,793
-All right, dog.
-Hey, don't be a stranger.

944
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:43,293
Thanks, guys. Thank you very much.

945
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,458
Come on back anytime.

947
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:54,707
Let me up in this thing, man.

948
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,306
Hey, Nikki.

949
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:01,815
-That's what I'm talking about.
-Ha, ha.

950
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:05,153
Oh. Heh, heh. Come on in.

951
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,323
-Everything okay?
-You know it.

952
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:26,171
Well, how about you help me out
with this menu?

953
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,503
Sure.

954
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,579
Because I don't understand nothing
that's on here.

955
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:33,079
Well, it's all pretty good.

956
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,912
Their chicken piccata is fantastic,
though.

957
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:38,316
-Maybe you should try that.
-You ate here before?

958
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:40,347
LeBron brought me here a few times.

959
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,548
-"LeBron"?
-Mm-hm.

960
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:45,591
Le-- LeBron James?

961
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:47,320
It was months ago, Kevin.

962
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:50,761
Damn. You just be doing it big, huh?

963
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:54,735
What? What you gonna tell me next,
Jay-Z brought you here too?

964
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:56,270
Please don't go there.

965
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,271
Jay and I don't speak anymore.

966
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:07,444
-Here. He can't pay for that.
-Heh.

967
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:08,744
-How you doing?
-Hi.

968
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:11,752
-I'm Benny. Nice to meet you. Pleasure.
-Yeah.

969
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:15,222
Hey, hey, hey. Let me get some water.

970
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,790
That's good. Mm-hm.

971
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,920
Mm-mm-mm.

972
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,961
You just stand here
till I tell you I'm thirsty.

973
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,865
Mm.

974
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:27,903
Let's get some lemon for that.

975
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,505
Are you crazy?
I like crazy girls, but not like stalker.

976
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:32,869
I need a girl I can take to
church and strip clubs.

977
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:34,840
-Hand me that silverware.
-The silverware?

978
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:36,036
Nigga, are you serious?

979
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:38,841
-Hey, this is phat, baby.
-We can't be doing this.

980
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,475
-We should go.
-You blowing up the spot.

981
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:44,052
Just take the shit
and put it in your purse.

982
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:48,251
Chicken. I'm just gonna try
the piccotto chicken--

983
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,052
Piccata.

984
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:52,718
-I'm gonna have some of that. Um....
-Right.

985
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:56,099
Good choice, though.
That's what Bill always gets.

986
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,762
"Bill"?

987
00:48:58,168 --> 00:49:00,136
Bill who? Clinton?

988
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:03,068
Heh, heh. No, Kevin. Cosby.

989
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,402
Thank you. Lemon in the water, please.

990
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:08,441
Oh, and I dropped my napkin.

991
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,603
Watch cartoons,
Saturday morning cartoons.

992
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,646
-Can I have some of this?
-Yeah, of course.

993
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:16,813
Heh.

994
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:19,512
Seventy-five dollars for this? Wow.

995
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,659
What were you expecting,
some big old ghetto burger?

996
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:24,691
-Well--
-Just try it, Kevin.

997
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:27,489
I just thought it'd be
a big piece of chicken.

998
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:32,530
See? Good, right?

999
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:35,327
It is good. It ain't bad.
It's all right.

1000
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:39,299
Well, if you think that's tender...

1001
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:42,340
...warm and juicy....

1002
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:03,490
Damn.

1003
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:07,603
Just relax and let me do all the work.

1004
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:10,034
Oh, damn.

1005
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:19,912
This condom here.

1006
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:21,875
Put this on.

1007
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:24,448
Get it out.

1009
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,689
You just feisty.

1010
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,059
Let me help you. Here we go.

1011
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:37,928
Violent.

1012
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:41,360
Wait, wait, wait.
Let me put the condom on.

1013
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:44,907
-Yeah, let me--
-You don't need that, baby.

1014
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:49,878
Wait, we can't-- We can't--

1015
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:54,177
Look, it's just I don't think we should do it.
I'm not ready to be a father yet.

1016
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:57,180
You say it like it's the worst thing
in the world.

1017
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:00,689
What, you think you're too good
to give me a baby?

1018
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:02,882
No, it's not that-- Oh!

1019
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,584
It's just, we just young!

1021
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:09,630
Look, what if you get pregnant
or something?

1022
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:13,969
We should use it because
that way we won't have babies.

1023
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:15,434
We don't need babies.

1024
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,138
It's just a lot. It's a lot.

1025
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:18,797
-Tsh.
-What?

1027
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,904
Goddamn it, Kevin.
Soon as y'all get that little money...

1028
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,776
...all I ever hear is,
"Condom, condom, condom."

1029
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:31,553
Every hoodrat in this project gets to be
a baby mama for some baller except me?

1030
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,657
Is that why you called me up here?
So I can get you pregnant?

1031
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:40,889
Sorry to bust your bubble, sweetie,
but a bitch gotta get paid.

1032
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:43,793
And this-- Over here, Kevin.

1033
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:47,268
--right here, is my lottery ticket.

1034
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:53,305
You can let yourself out.

1035
00:52:01,883 --> 00:52:03,510
Hey, youngster.

1036
00:52:03,685 --> 00:52:05,312
Come here for a minute.

1037
00:52:05,487 --> 00:52:07,682
I wanna talk to you about something.

1038
00:52:07,856 --> 00:52:09,881
-Well, can it wait?
-No.

1039
00:52:10,092 --> 00:52:12,993
Not if you care about that lottery ticket
that's in your wallet.

1040
00:52:20,202 --> 00:52:21,863
Might as well come all the way in.

1041
00:52:22,804 --> 00:52:24,965
You done come this far.

1042
00:52:43,659 --> 00:52:46,321
Don't you worry about that lotto ticket.

1043
00:52:46,862 --> 00:52:48,420
If I wanted it...

1044
00:52:48,697 --> 00:52:50,961
... I'd have hit you
with a four-punch combination.

1045
00:52:51,133 --> 00:52:52,828
You'd have never seen it coming.

1046
00:52:56,004 --> 00:52:57,733
Come on in, man. Stop looking scared.

1047
00:52:59,508 --> 00:53:00,770
I won't bite you.

1048
00:53:01,576 --> 00:53:03,908
First I wanna see what you got.
What you got? Come on.

1049
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,274
-Why you fighting me?
-Let's go. What you got?

1050
00:53:06,448 --> 00:53:08,848
-Can you protect yourself at all times?
-Yes.

1051
00:53:09,017 --> 00:53:10,507
-At all times?
-Yes.

1052
00:53:10,686 --> 00:53:11,675
Well, do it!

1053
00:53:20,595 --> 00:53:23,223
Come on in, man.
I'm just playing with you. Damn.

1054
00:53:23,665 --> 00:53:24,723
Come on in, man.

1056
00:53:27,803 --> 00:53:31,170
Why you looking all scared? Huh?

1057
00:53:31,339 --> 00:53:35,571
It's your ugly friend Benny the one
think I'm a serial killer. Right?

1058
00:53:35,744 --> 00:53:37,075
How you know about my ticket?

1059
00:53:37,245 --> 00:53:39,873
Oh, man, I hear everything
that go on around here.

1060
00:53:40,449 --> 00:53:45,386
If I asleep on this couch or taking a dump,
then I don't hear too much.

1061
00:53:45,787 --> 00:53:46,947
But you don't go outside.

1062
00:53:47,622 --> 00:53:49,590
I don't need to go outside.

1063
00:53:49,758 --> 00:53:51,589
You see that vent right there?

1064
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,396
With this vent I can hear everything
going on with y'all right here.

1065
00:53:55,564 --> 00:53:57,429
I listen for hours.

1066
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,157
I just pull this right here.

1067
00:53:59,334 --> 00:54:01,962
-you had a helicopter,
where you gonna park that thing at?

1068
00:54:02,137 --> 00:54:05,470
Man, I'll park it on the roof.
Why is you all in my helicopter here?

1069
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,938
-Y'all gonna be like my peasants around here.
-What?

1070
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:09,509
You gonna go get my Now and Laters.

1071
00:54:09,678 --> 00:54:11,305
I'm the baller.

1072
00:54:11,646 --> 00:54:14,638
-You want some red Kool-Aid?
-Yeah.

1073
00:54:16,284 --> 00:54:17,979
So...

1074
00:54:18,153 --> 00:54:19,518
...why not go outside?

1075
00:54:20,756 --> 00:54:22,485
I don't need to go outside.

1076
00:54:22,657 --> 00:54:24,750
Go out for what?

1077
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:29,463
Ain't nothing around here
but drug dealers shooting each other.

1078
00:54:29,831 --> 00:54:33,028
-Y'all can have it. Here you go.
-Thanks.

1079
00:54:33,268 --> 00:54:35,759
What's up with the gloves?
You used to box or something?

1080
00:54:36,171 --> 00:54:37,604
"Used to"?

1082
00:54:44,446 --> 00:54:46,573
Still got a little something.

1083
00:54:47,783 --> 00:54:50,274
Man, you box anybody I know?

1085
00:54:53,021 --> 00:54:56,081
-You ever heard of Muhammad Ali?
-Have I?

1086
00:54:56,958 --> 00:54:58,482
Larry Holmes.

1087
00:54:59,294 --> 00:55:02,263
Earnie Shavers. Ken Norton.

1088
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:04,557
Ronnie Lyle.

1089
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,034
I even knocked out, uh--
What's that boy's name? Leon Spinks.

1090
00:55:09,204 --> 00:55:11,001
I'm the one knocked them teeth out.

1091
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,335
What, you think I'm lying?

1092
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:17,508
Look, man, I was they sparring partner.

1093
00:55:17,846 --> 00:55:21,407
They used to give me $300 a round
to spar.

1094
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:23,574
That was big money back then.

1095
00:55:25,387 --> 00:55:28,049
I never got my shot, you know?

1096
00:55:28,223 --> 00:55:31,090
I never got a real fight.

1097
00:55:32,327 --> 00:55:33,988
But hey, I'm here.

1098
00:55:34,329 --> 00:55:37,025
So why they call you Thump?
Is it because you hit hard?

1099
00:55:37,933 --> 00:55:40,629
They call me Thump
because I hit the canvas hard.

1100
00:55:42,571 --> 00:55:45,005
But I always got back up.

1101
00:55:45,841 --> 00:55:47,035
Damn.

1102
00:55:47,209 --> 00:55:48,574
You wasn't that good, huh?

1103
00:55:49,077 --> 00:55:51,011
I didn't ever say I was.

1104
00:55:51,213 --> 00:55:53,841
You know? I just love boxing.

1105
00:55:54,049 --> 00:55:57,917
As a little kid, I just wanted to be a boxer,
so I gave it a shot.

1106
00:56:00,222 --> 00:56:02,087
Weren't you nervous
that you would fail?

1107
00:56:02,624 --> 00:56:06,082
Of course.
But that ain't why you don't try.

1108
00:56:07,195 --> 00:56:10,426
What if I was one of the greats? Hm?

1109
00:56:12,133 --> 00:56:14,033
What if it was all about me?

1110
00:56:14,269 --> 00:56:16,567
I wouldn't know if I didn't try.

1111
00:56:16,738 --> 00:56:20,196
I know I could've looked good
on that poster too.

1112
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:23,241
Heh.

1113
00:56:23,411 --> 00:56:25,242
Oh, man....

1114
00:56:26,481 --> 00:56:31,441
Look, man, I wish I could stay longer,
but I gotta get going, you know?

1115
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,679
Hey, wait. Hey, hey.

1116
00:56:34,356 --> 00:56:38,053
Them is some interesting shoes
you got right there on your feet.

1117
00:56:38,226 --> 00:56:40,626
Man, what the hell are those?
I like them.

1118
00:56:40,795 --> 00:56:41,955
-Like them, huh?
-Yes.

1119
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:46,567
Hey, look, when I first got a little money,
it wasn't 300 million...

1120
00:56:46,735 --> 00:56:49,533
...but I got a little jewelry,
you know what I mean?

1121
00:56:49,704 --> 00:56:53,640
I was sharp. I had my leather piece,
I had my Cadillac...

1122
00:56:53,808 --> 00:56:55,605
...I had some girls out front.

1123
00:56:55,777 --> 00:56:57,904
I had everything a man could want.

1124
00:56:58,613 --> 00:57:00,808
Yeah, everything.

1125
00:57:01,449 --> 00:57:04,418
Man. What happened to it?

1126
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,580
I got robbed,
right out here on this stoop.

1127
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:11,254
They shot me in my ass...

1128
00:57:11,593 --> 00:57:14,824
...ended my whole career just like that.

1129
00:57:15,397 --> 00:57:16,625
What can you do, man?

1130
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:20,734
You step on a tent and it bent,
and that's the way it went.

1131
00:57:20,902 --> 00:57:25,703
It's the neighborhood, man.
It's this neighborhood.

1132
00:57:27,008 --> 00:57:28,942
I just wish somebody...

1133
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:32,807
...had the courage to come along
and make a difference.

1134
00:57:36,685 --> 00:57:37,913
Okay.

1135
00:57:38,086 --> 00:57:41,317
I don't know, man.
I ain't gonna hold you, Kevin.

1136
00:57:41,489 --> 00:57:44,322
I just wanted some company, man.
That's all.

1137
00:57:46,695 --> 00:57:50,028
-All right, Kevin.
-Thanks, man. Thanks.

1138
00:57:50,966 --> 00:57:55,027
-See? Protect yourself at all times.
-Gotcha.

1139
00:58:06,581 --> 00:58:09,641
Okay, folks, now
sometimes we get articles come to the club...

1140
00:58:09,818 --> 00:58:12,218
...that are sometimes fun and extravagant.

1141
00:58:12,387 --> 00:58:14,150
Well, we have something
coming up next...

1142
00:58:14,322 --> 00:58:17,223
...that has to do with your health.
This is very--

1144
00:58:20,228 --> 00:58:23,857
Come by here, my Lord
Come by here

1145
00:58:24,032 --> 00:58:27,160
Come by here, my Lord
Come by here

1146
00:58:28,169 --> 00:58:31,661
Come by here, my Lord
Come by here

1147
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:37,904
Oh, Lord, come by here

1149
00:58:48,556 --> 00:58:50,820
Good morning, brothers and sisters.

1150
00:58:51,559 --> 00:58:54,687
I know that you know that miracles
happen every day.

1151
00:58:54,863 --> 00:58:56,023
-That's right.
-Yes.

1152
00:58:56,197 --> 00:59:01,567
And I pray that the heavenly Father
is listening to us right now.

1153
00:59:01,736 --> 00:59:03,260
-Yes.
-He knows what you'll do...

1154
00:59:03,438 --> 00:59:05,565
... before you do it,
what you'd do before you did it...

1155
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:07,867
...and what you'll do
when you leave here.

1156
00:59:10,045 --> 00:59:11,740
When you hear me say "miracles"...

1157
00:59:11,913 --> 00:59:15,940
...I'm not talking about Smokey Robinson
and the four brothers out of Detroit!

1158
00:59:16,117 --> 00:59:18,278
That's right, I'm not talking about
those fellas.

1159
00:59:18,453 --> 00:59:20,284
I'm not talking about...

1160
00:59:20,455 --> 00:59:24,050
...the delicious spread you spread on
the bread called the Miracle Whip!

1163
00:59:30,765 --> 00:59:33,757
Go ahead, Reverend. Heh.

1164
00:59:33,935 --> 00:59:36,165
I, Reverend Taylor,
have had a vision.

1165
00:59:36,337 --> 00:59:37,804
What'd you see, brother?

1166
00:59:37,972 --> 00:59:40,099
-For many, many years.
-Yes.

1167
00:59:40,475 --> 00:59:45,742
And the vision has been for me
to have a brand-new church.

1168
00:59:45,914 --> 00:59:48,815
-Yes.
-So that I can come here on Sunday...

1169
00:59:49,184 --> 00:59:51,982
...and preach the word of God!

1170
00:59:56,291 --> 00:59:58,156
For instance, hit the lights.

1171
00:59:58,693 --> 01:00:00,024
Okay, here we go.

1172
01:00:00,195 --> 01:00:02,220
Let me show you all
what I'm talking about.

1173
01:00:02,397 --> 01:00:03,921
Look.

1174
01:00:04,332 --> 01:00:09,827
This is the church we are currently sitting in
right now, brothers and sisters. Look at it.

1175
01:00:10,672 --> 01:00:12,833
I had some Mexicans
working on that "chimley."

1176
01:00:13,141 --> 01:00:14,768
I got four of them at the Home Depot.

1177
01:00:14,943 --> 01:00:17,104
Jumped in the van
like they was gonna do it right.

1178
01:00:17,278 --> 01:00:19,940
They end up putting masking tape
all on top of the "chimley."

1179
01:00:20,115 --> 01:00:21,309
Help us, Lord.

1180
01:00:21,483 --> 01:00:23,610
Show them my next church.
Look at that! Oh, Lord.

1181
01:00:25,854 --> 01:00:28,914
This is the kind of church make you
wanna come and praise the Lord.

1183
01:00:30,658 --> 01:00:32,626
Make you wanna put something
in the plate.

1184
01:00:32,794 --> 01:00:36,321
And if we ain't got a plate, just put
what you gonna give me in my hand.

1185
01:00:36,498 --> 01:00:38,557
-Yes.
-This is my home.

1186
01:00:38,733 --> 01:00:40,997
Oh, have mercy.

1187
01:00:42,137 --> 01:00:46,801
Many of you brothers and sisters didn't
know that I was living so humble, did you?

1188
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:50,138
I sleep up here.

1189
01:00:51,012 --> 01:00:52,411
In this room right here.

1190
01:00:53,081 --> 01:00:54,810
Grandma, don't you see
what's going on?

1191
01:00:54,983 --> 01:00:56,644
This is my vision. Look at that.

1192
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:02,251
T.D. Jakes. Benjamin and Long.

1193
01:01:02,423 --> 01:01:03,822
Everybody's living like this.

1194
01:01:03,992 --> 01:01:05,857
Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.

1195
01:01:06,027 --> 01:01:07,517
Why come I can't have a Jacuzzi?

1196
01:01:07,695 --> 01:01:10,186
Why come I can't eat shrimps and steak?

1197
01:01:10,365 --> 01:01:11,889
Lord, why come I can't have that?

1198
01:01:12,066 --> 01:01:14,466
-Did he ask you? No.
-Where he gonna get the money?

1200
01:01:19,407 --> 01:01:20,840
-He's not asking.
-That's not right.

1201
01:01:21,009 --> 01:01:25,139
Those sisters who need help,
that want to pray privately with me....

1202
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:27,473
-Private.
-Tell it, pastor.

1203
01:01:27,649 --> 01:01:30,618
-My ex-wife.
-Ooh.

1204
01:01:30,785 --> 01:01:33,549
Goat-smelling ass,
built like a sack of laundry.

1205
01:01:34,789 --> 01:01:35,983
Fake Louis Vuitton purse.

1206
01:01:36,157 --> 01:01:38,284
She done let them Chinese
trick her nine times.

1207
01:01:38,459 --> 01:01:41,326
-Oh, yes.
-This is the wife God want me to have.

1208
01:01:43,932 --> 01:01:47,766
Praise the Lord.
Does she have a twin sister? Ha.

1209
01:01:48,803 --> 01:01:49,827
Tramp.

1210
01:01:50,004 --> 01:01:53,269
Do you get the vision that I'm trying
to tell you, ladies and gentlemen?

1211
01:01:53,441 --> 01:01:56,376
God works in mysterious ways.

1212
01:01:56,544 --> 01:02:00,173
God might not be there when you want him,
but he's always there when you want him!

1213
01:02:00,715 --> 01:02:01,739
Hm?

1214
01:02:01,916 --> 01:02:04,714
We got a miracle in the house today.

1215
01:02:07,088 --> 01:02:08,487
Kevin, please come up here.

1216
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:12,353
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Kevin.
Kevin, come on. Put your hands together.

1217
01:02:12,527 --> 01:02:16,224
-I don't wanna go up there.
-Go up there and talk to the preacher.

1218
01:02:19,133 --> 01:02:20,532
That's my grandbaby.

1219
01:02:22,103 --> 01:02:24,128
Yeah, baby.

1220
01:02:26,574 --> 01:02:27,905
Kevin! Kevin!

1221
01:02:29,377 --> 01:02:30,605
Yo.

1222
01:02:30,778 --> 01:02:32,268
-Yo, he's coming.
-Who's coming?

1223
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,607
-Jesus?
-No, not Jesus!

1224
01:02:34,148 --> 01:02:36,810
Lorenzo, he's out of jail.
He was chasing me and he's coming.

1225
01:02:37,252 --> 01:02:39,379
-What you want me to do?
-Just stand right there.

1226
01:02:39,988 --> 01:02:41,478
-Hey. Thank you.
-You got a gun?

1227
01:02:41,656 --> 01:02:44,216
-Y'all ready for a miracle?
-Yeah.

1228
01:02:44,392 --> 01:02:45,586
That's right.

1229
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,228
Pastor is always talking about a miracle.

1230
01:02:49,631 --> 01:02:54,591
I wanna let y'all know the biggest sinner
of our time is coming to get saved.

1231
01:02:54,769 --> 01:02:56,236
Y'all give it up for Lorenzo.

1234
01:03:02,777 --> 01:03:04,176
Go, go!

1235
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,675
Who let that nigga out of jail?

1236
01:03:08,716 --> 01:03:10,377
Get off me.

1237
01:03:11,185 --> 01:03:13,312
Next person that touch me
about to get stabbed...

1238
01:03:13,488 --> 01:03:15,251
...I swear before God!

1239
01:03:21,596 --> 01:03:23,621
No, no, no!

1240
01:03:24,365 --> 01:03:25,423
Damn!

1241
01:03:25,633 --> 01:03:29,034
Look, man, I'm sorry, all right?
I didn't mean to set you up, I promise.

1242
01:03:29,203 --> 01:03:31,068
-You mean that Foot Locker thing?
-Yeah.

1243
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:33,537
No, no, no, I'm over that, man.
I'm over that.

1244
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:36,506
-You and me, we got different business.
-Okay.

1246
01:03:39,847 --> 01:03:42,543
-I'm gonna need that lottery ticket now.
-Huh?

1247
01:03:44,252 --> 01:03:46,686
If you don't back up off that boy
nice and slow...

1248
01:03:46,854 --> 01:03:49,322
... I'm gonna blow your head off quick.

1249
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,324
You know what I think?

1250
01:04:03,171 --> 01:04:04,638
I think you a little bitch.

1251
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:08,365
Ain't never shot nobody
in your whole life.

1254
01:04:16,784 --> 01:04:19,480
Pull a piece on me, you better use it!

1256
01:04:28,363 --> 01:04:30,558
-What's happening?
-Excuse me.

1257
01:04:32,734 --> 01:04:34,361
Yo, come back here, man.

1259
01:04:40,942 --> 01:04:42,341
Right there, right there!

1260
01:04:44,045 --> 01:04:45,535
Come on, come on!

1261
01:04:47,248 --> 01:04:48,875
-Come on!
-Hey.

1262
01:04:51,052 --> 01:04:52,713
Get out my way!

1263
01:04:54,822 --> 01:04:56,790
-Get out the way, get out the way.
-You okay?

1264
01:04:57,492 --> 01:04:59,084
Move! Move, move, move!

1265
01:05:02,263 --> 01:05:04,356
-Excuse me.
-Get him, get him!

1267
01:05:14,575 --> 01:05:15,803
Shit!

1268
01:05:29,724 --> 01:05:30,748
Oh, shit.

1269
01:05:34,996 --> 01:05:36,987
Leave the little man alone!

1270
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:44,194
Hey.

1271
01:05:45,106 --> 01:05:46,334
Fuck!

1272
01:05:56,717 --> 01:05:58,810
I'll see you when I see you.

1273
01:06:08,396 --> 01:06:12,230
Look, I don't see Lorenzo and his boys,
so it look like you safe to go home now.

1274
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,095
-Safe?
-Yeah.

1275
01:06:14,268 --> 01:06:16,168
You really think we safe? Huh?

1276
01:06:16,337 --> 01:06:20,865
Kevin, look. All you gotta do is
get through the next day and a half...

1277
01:06:21,042 --> 01:06:23,169
-...and we good.
-And then what?

1278
01:06:23,344 --> 01:06:25,005
Then you get your money.

1279
01:06:26,447 --> 01:06:28,779
Is this what having money feels like?
Huh?

1280
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:30,474
Everybody asking me for something?

1281
01:06:30,651 --> 01:06:33,620
People I ain't talked to in years
calling my phone?

1282
01:06:33,921 --> 01:06:35,013
I don't want it, man.

1283
01:06:36,123 --> 01:06:37,681
I heard this quote once:

1284
01:06:37,859 --> 01:06:41,351
"Money don't change you,
it changes the people around you."

1285
01:06:41,529 --> 01:06:42,553
You understand that?

1286
01:06:43,831 --> 01:06:45,924
Come on, Kev. I heard this quote too.

1287
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:48,466
We quoting now? We quoting now?

1288
01:06:48,636 --> 01:06:50,467
I got this quote:
"People gonna be people.

1289
01:06:50,638 --> 01:06:52,970
They gonna lie,
they gonna cheat and they gonna steal.

1290
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:55,540
As long as you get yours,
you keep it moving."

1291
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:59,908
-So let's go home.
-It's not that easy, Benny. It's not.

1292
01:07:06,654 --> 01:07:09,282
-Kev, how about this?
-What?

1293
01:07:09,457 --> 01:07:11,391
Let me hold onto it for you.

1294
01:07:12,493 --> 01:07:13,926
Let you hold onto what?

1295
01:07:14,262 --> 01:07:15,729
The ticket.

1296
01:07:16,097 --> 01:07:20,864
That case, if Lorenzo catches you,
you won't get jacked.

1297
01:07:24,605 --> 01:07:26,436
You too?

1298
01:07:27,241 --> 01:07:30,836
After what I just said to you?
And you hit me with this bullshit?

1299
01:07:31,012 --> 01:07:33,776
-It ain't like that.
-What you mean, "It ain't like that"?

1300
01:07:33,948 --> 01:07:35,939
-It is like that. It is!
-It ain't like that.

1301
01:07:36,117 --> 01:07:38,085
-You losing it, man.
-You got the wrong one.

1302
01:07:38,252 --> 01:07:39,583
-You serious?
-Dead-ass serious.

1303
01:07:39,754 --> 01:07:40,778
Come on, Kev.

1304
01:07:41,656 --> 01:07:44,250
-I been your best friend since fifth grade.
-Act like it.

1305
01:07:44,425 --> 01:07:45,653
-Fifth grade!
-Act like it!

1306
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:48,688
Ain't no way I'll let this money
compromise our friendship.

1307
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,887
Okay.

1308
01:07:50,064 --> 01:07:52,157
You can have it.
You can have this shit, Kev.

1309
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:53,630
You can have the whole thing.

1310
01:07:53,801 --> 01:07:55,291
I don't want it!

1311
01:07:55,469 --> 01:07:57,266
-I don't want none of this!
-What you got?

1312
01:07:57,438 --> 01:08:02,466
I'm up here losing my damn mind,
running up and down the streets for us!

1313
01:08:02,643 --> 01:08:05,635
-Ain't no "us" shit! Ain't no us, nigga!
-lt is us, Kev! It is us!

1314
01:08:05,813 --> 01:08:07,576
-It's everybody!
-What you talking about?

1315
01:08:07,748 --> 01:08:09,375
You ain't in my shoes,
you don't know.

1316
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:11,450
-Look at this, look at us.
-I'm not looking.

1317
01:08:11,619 --> 01:08:15,521
Look at our circumstances, man.
Look where we from!

1318
01:08:16,457 --> 01:08:17,685
I'm tired of this, man.

1319
01:08:18,426 --> 01:08:20,326
I'm sick of worrying about WlC cards!

1320
01:08:20,494 --> 01:08:22,724
I'm sick of worrying
about the government--

1321
01:08:23,731 --> 01:08:25,130
I can't eat!

1322
01:08:25,299 --> 01:08:27,199
I'm broke, nigga! I'm broke!

1323
01:08:27,368 --> 01:08:29,302
And you got the power
to change that, Kev.

1324
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:31,631
Nobody else. You.

1325
01:08:32,573 --> 01:08:34,666
Kevin, if I had the money...

1326
01:08:34,842 --> 01:08:35,866
"If."

1327
01:08:36,043 --> 01:08:38,102
...not only would I give back...

1328
01:08:38,512 --> 01:08:40,742
...I would change lives.

1329
01:08:41,582 --> 01:08:47,316
The sad thing is, you known me
for this long and you still don't get it.

1330
01:08:49,323 --> 01:08:51,291
Bust a move, homey.

1332
01:09:12,313 --> 01:09:14,076
You want me to be honest?

1333
01:09:14,248 --> 01:09:15,977
That's why I'm here, right?

1334
01:09:16,484 --> 01:09:19,282
Look, you know I can't even stand
Benny half the time...

1335
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:22,217
...but he is not a thief, and you know it.

1336
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:24,358
If anything, that boy is too loyal to you.

1337
01:09:25,226 --> 01:09:29,526
You probably hurt his feelings,
and I personally think you acted like an ass.

1338
01:09:29,697 --> 01:09:31,688
-And you need to tell him you're sorry.
-What?

1339
01:09:31,866 --> 01:09:32,992
That's the truth.

1340
01:09:33,167 --> 01:09:34,930
-Central Bank on Wednesday....

1341
01:09:35,536 --> 01:09:38,471
What? You said you wanted me
to be honest, right?

1342
01:09:42,777 --> 01:09:44,768
-Stacie.
-What's up?

1343
01:09:45,746 --> 01:09:48,044
If you won the lottery,
what would you do?

1344
01:09:48,549 --> 01:09:50,016
Me?

1345
01:09:50,518 --> 01:09:51,746
I mean, you know...

1346
01:09:51,919 --> 01:09:55,355
...take care of my family, travel...

1347
01:09:55,523 --> 01:09:57,320
...finish school, all that good stuff.

1348
01:09:57,525 --> 01:10:00,392
But if I had your kind of money,
I'd give back.

1349
01:10:00,561 --> 01:10:03,826
Give people something to live for
instead of just living, you know?

1350
01:10:05,433 --> 01:10:10,302
Like, look at how some of these rappers
always talk about, "Shout out to my 'hood."

1351
01:10:10,471 --> 01:10:13,804
But what are they giving back
other than just shoutouts?

1352
01:10:13,974 --> 01:10:15,498
Thank you.

1353
01:10:17,178 --> 01:10:19,009
It's cool, it's just a grilled cheese.

1354
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:21,842
No, no. Not for the sandwich.

1355
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:25,483
Just thanks for being there for me.

1356
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:32,687
I mean that.

1357
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:37,888
It's cool.

1358
01:10:38,666 --> 01:10:40,065
I got you.

1359
01:10:40,701 --> 01:10:42,601
I appreciate it.

1360
01:10:43,804 --> 01:10:46,864
-But now I need you to tell me something.
-What's up?

1361
01:10:47,041 --> 01:10:49,339
What happened on your little date
with Nikki Swayze?

1362
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:52,070
Say "I told you so."
All she wanted to be was my baby mama.

1363
01:10:52,246 --> 01:10:53,543
Wow, what?

1364
01:10:53,714 --> 01:10:56,649
Nikki, the no-class, gold-digging bitch.

1365
01:10:56,817 --> 01:10:58,512
I'm shocked.

1366
01:10:59,353 --> 01:11:01,685
I mean, but at least
you got what you wanted:

1367
01:11:01,856 --> 01:11:03,551
To tell all your boys you hit that.

1368
01:11:03,724 --> 01:11:05,589
Because I didn't.

1369
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,228
God on my mama,
I ain't touched that girl.

1370
01:11:08,395 --> 01:11:09,692
Mm-hm.

1371
01:11:09,997 --> 01:11:11,965
I'm kind of glad I didn't too.

1372
01:11:12,133 --> 01:11:13,191
What do I look like?

1373
01:11:13,367 --> 01:11:16,598
Swapping swords
with half of the Fortune 500.

1374
01:11:16,971 --> 01:11:18,632
I'm straight.

1375
01:11:19,106 --> 01:11:20,403
And besides...

1376
01:11:21,509 --> 01:11:23,909
...that's not the kind of girl
I need anyway.

1377
01:11:24,111 --> 01:11:27,842
Oh, really? Who is the kind
of girl you need, then?

1378
01:11:30,518 --> 01:11:32,247
Can I be honest?

1379
01:11:32,419 --> 01:11:34,649
Ain't that why you came here?

1380
01:11:40,161 --> 01:11:42,220
The kind of girl I need is you.

1381
01:11:48,769 --> 01:11:50,862
Goodbye, Kevin. Goodbye.

1382
01:11:51,038 --> 01:11:52,266
What, you gonna kick me out?

1383
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:55,203
You know what? I'm not interested
in being your second choice.

1384
01:11:55,376 --> 01:11:57,037
How long have we known each other?

1385
01:11:57,211 --> 01:11:59,145
Why did it take you so long
to tell me this?

1386
01:11:59,313 --> 01:12:02,077
Oh. After you and Nikki,
all of a sudden you wanna be with me?

1387
01:12:02,249 --> 01:12:04,843
Why'd it take you so long?
I'm not that girl, okay?

1388
01:12:05,019 --> 01:12:06,543
Don't get it--

1389
01:12:09,757 --> 01:12:11,384
--twisted.

1390
01:12:33,547 --> 01:12:34,707
-Hold on, hold on.
-What?

1391
01:12:34,882 --> 01:12:35,906
-Wait, hold on.
-What?

1392
01:12:36,083 --> 01:12:37,175
Wait.

1393
01:12:39,286 --> 01:12:42,153
Tst. Damn, girl, how many dudes
you done had up in your bed?

1394
01:12:42,323 --> 01:12:44,348
What? Don't try to play me.

1395
01:12:44,592 --> 01:12:47,925
If you think we're doing this
without a condom, you're tripping.

1396
01:12:48,562 --> 01:12:49,927
What?

1397
01:12:51,432 --> 01:12:52,865
Nothing.

1398
01:13:00,107 --> 01:13:01,131
Stacie!

1399
01:13:01,942 --> 01:13:03,466
-Oh, shit, it's my mama!
-Your mama?

1400
01:13:03,644 --> 01:13:05,771
-You gotta go.
-Damn, your mama?

1401
01:13:06,513 --> 01:13:07,946
-What?
-Come on.

1402
01:13:08,115 --> 01:13:10,310
-You gotta-- Get out! No!
-What? Let me go.

1403
01:13:10,484 --> 01:13:11,951
-Out where?
-Get out.

1404
01:13:12,119 --> 01:13:13,950
-Out the window?
-Sorry. Yes.

1405
01:13:14,321 --> 01:13:16,516
-Careful.
-Goddamn.

1406
01:13:21,195 --> 01:13:22,253
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

1407
01:13:22,429 --> 01:13:24,260
Please be careful. Okay.

1408
01:13:24,431 --> 01:13:25,762
-What?
-I love you.

1409
01:13:26,734 --> 01:13:28,133
I love you too.

1410
01:13:28,302 --> 01:13:30,736
Now go. Get down.

1412
01:14:13,814 --> 01:14:15,509
Where am I?

1413
01:14:16,784 --> 01:14:17,978
Morning.

1415
01:14:21,555 --> 01:14:23,546
Now, relax now, son, relax.

1416
01:14:23,724 --> 01:14:26,591
Don't worry about nothing,
you just got knocked the fuck out.

1417
01:14:28,963 --> 01:14:33,093
Put these black-eyed peas on your jaw.
Take down the swelling.

1418
01:14:39,707 --> 01:14:42,175
What you talking about?
Man, are you crazy?

1419
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:45,175
Ain't nobody knock me out.

1420
01:14:52,553 --> 01:14:54,145
Hold on.

1421
01:14:57,925 --> 01:14:59,222
Wait a minute.

1422
01:14:59,793 --> 01:15:00,953
Where's my ticket?

1423
01:15:02,363 --> 01:15:04,923
I don't know. They probably stole it.

1424
01:15:05,099 --> 01:15:07,499
That's why you was knocked out.

1425
01:15:08,068 --> 01:15:09,092
-Yeah.
-Damn!

1426
01:15:09,269 --> 01:15:11,169
Yeah, that about sums it up.

1427
01:15:14,475 --> 01:15:16,033
Wait a minute.

1428
01:15:16,610 --> 01:15:19,807
How do I know you didn't knock me out
yourself and stole my ticket?

1429
01:15:20,381 --> 01:15:24,875
The fact of the matter is Lorenzo
and his boys was out there walking.

1430
01:15:25,052 --> 01:15:27,452
I heard them talking and laughing.

1431
01:15:27,621 --> 01:15:30,988
I get up,
I look and see you stretched out.

1432
01:15:31,759 --> 01:15:33,556
Now, it wasn't easy...

1433
01:15:33,727 --> 01:15:37,561
...but I pick you up and I tote you in here
and put you on that couch.

1434
01:15:38,132 --> 01:15:39,463
And you talk to me like that?

1435
01:15:39,633 --> 01:15:44,127
I ain't been out this apartment
in 22 years and I did it for you.

1436
01:15:46,607 --> 01:15:48,199
You did that?

1437
01:15:52,146 --> 01:15:55,309
What I wanna know is,
did you sign the back of the ticket?

1438
01:15:55,482 --> 01:15:57,006
Why would I sign the ticket?

1439
01:15:57,751 --> 01:16:01,084
If you didn't sign the back of the ticket,
it's not valid.

1440
01:16:01,255 --> 01:16:03,519
-The cops is not gonna believe you.
-No, no.

1441
01:16:03,690 --> 01:16:05,089
Man, bump that!

1442
01:16:05,259 --> 01:16:07,124
Look, he stole my ticket.

1443
01:16:07,294 --> 01:16:10,354
I should be able to go right back to him
and get it back, straight up!

1444
01:16:11,532 --> 01:16:13,693
Okay, tiger. Okay.

1445
01:16:13,867 --> 01:16:19,464
But look, Lorenzo's a premature
crack-baby felon, okay?

1446
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:20,937
You gotta be careful.

1447
01:16:21,108 --> 01:16:22,666
What other choice do I have?

1448
01:16:22,843 --> 01:16:25,971
Well, I been thinking.

1449
01:16:26,647 --> 01:16:29,548
The same thing got you into this mess...

1450
01:16:29,983 --> 01:16:32,781
-...might just get you out.
-Man, I'm not trying to hear that.

1451
01:16:32,953 --> 01:16:34,079
-Wait, wait, wait--
-What?

1452
01:16:34,254 --> 01:16:36,347
-Where you going?
-I'm out, man.

1453
01:16:38,625 --> 01:16:40,058
Hold up.

1454
01:16:40,727 --> 01:16:41,853
You took my sneakers?

1455
01:16:42,696 --> 01:16:44,425
I was thinking about it.

1456
01:16:44,598 --> 01:16:47,032
But they wasn't on your feet
when I dragged you in here.

1457
01:16:47,835 --> 01:16:49,996
You wouldn't have did nothing.

1458
01:16:51,004 --> 01:16:52,437
Protect yourself at all times.

1459
01:16:52,606 --> 01:16:54,267
Whatever!

1460
01:16:56,477 --> 01:17:00,573
Protect yourself at all times.

1461
01:17:00,747 --> 01:17:03,045
Don't do this with this boy.

1462
01:17:03,217 --> 01:17:04,445
I'm too old for this.

1463
01:17:05,219 --> 01:17:08,450
Whoo! Thank you, Jesus!
Thank you, Jesus!

1464
01:17:08,622 --> 01:17:11,557
Thank you, Jesus! Oh.

1465
01:17:11,725 --> 01:17:14,319
Where the hell you been, boy?
I been worried sick about you.

1466
01:17:14,495 --> 01:17:17,055
Nobody know where you is, you didn't call.
What happened?

1467
01:17:17,231 --> 01:17:18,323
And where are your shoes?

1468
01:17:18,499 --> 01:17:20,660
-I got robbed!
-What?

1469
01:17:20,834 --> 01:17:22,358
Lorenzo took everything, all right?

1470
01:17:22,536 --> 01:17:24,663
Look, he took my ticket,
he took my shoes....

1471
01:17:24,838 --> 01:17:26,931
Oh. No, I'm calling the police.

1472
01:17:27,107 --> 01:17:28,540
Chill out. Don't do that.

1473
01:17:28,709 --> 01:17:31,234
What they gonna do?
I didn't sign the back of the ticket.

1474
01:17:31,411 --> 01:17:35,609
Boy, I told you. You'd given me that ticket,
I'd put it here, wouldn't nobody get to it.

1475
01:17:36,083 --> 01:17:38,745
Look, I got 24 hours to go claim
what's mine, all right?

1476
01:17:38,919 --> 01:17:41,114
And that's what I'm about to go do.

1477
01:17:41,288 --> 01:17:42,380
That's how it is.

1478
01:17:45,292 --> 01:17:47,487
Oh, hell, no. I'm calling somebody.

1479
01:17:50,330 --> 01:17:51,354
Stacie?

1480
01:17:51,532 --> 01:17:53,124
Watch it. Watch.

1481
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:55,928
-Come on, come on. Bet back, bet back.
-What up, B?

1482
01:17:56,803 --> 01:17:58,464
Nothing.

1483
01:17:58,772 --> 01:18:01,297
Chilling with my real friends.
What's up with you?

1484
01:18:01,475 --> 01:18:04,205
That ain't no dirty dice.
That's my money on the ground, fool.

1485
01:18:04,711 --> 01:18:06,906
Let me holler at you real quick, man.

1486
01:18:07,247 --> 01:18:09,943
Your drawers is dirty, not my dice.

1487
01:18:10,117 --> 01:18:11,641
Come on, man.

1488
01:18:13,787 --> 01:18:14,879
What's up, Kev?

1489
01:18:15,055 --> 01:18:16,545
Look, man.

1490
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:19,484
I'm sorry about what happened
on the roof the other day.

1491
01:18:20,294 --> 01:18:21,989
I mean that, man.

1492
01:18:24,598 --> 01:18:28,534
Look, Kev, I know my approach to life
might be a little off...

1493
01:18:30,404 --> 01:18:32,668
... but just know my intentions are good.

1494
01:18:38,345 --> 01:18:40,279
-We boys?
-We boys.

1495
01:18:40,447 --> 01:18:41,812
All day.

1496
01:18:46,053 --> 01:18:49,147
Kevin, you got that Bobby Brown look
in your eyes, man. What you doing?

1497
01:18:49,323 --> 01:18:52,087
Where the hell you been, man?
You harder to find than a job.

1498
01:18:52,259 --> 01:18:55,194
Man, like you would know.
You ain't had a job since Thriller.

1499
01:18:55,362 --> 01:18:56,829
-Where Lorenzo at?
-What?

1500
01:18:56,997 --> 01:18:58,089
Lorenzo Mack?

1501
01:18:58,265 --> 01:19:02,201
I saw him yesterday when he was
racing you up and down the street.

1503
01:19:03,637 --> 01:19:07,232
Man, listen. When y'all see Lorenzo,
let him know I'm looking for his ass.

1504
01:19:07,407 --> 01:19:08,965
-Tell him that.
-Don't say nothing.

1505
01:19:09,142 --> 01:19:10,166
Kevin....

1506
01:19:10,344 --> 01:19:13,313
-Wait-- Is he looking for--?
-He wants to find Lorenzo?

1507
01:19:14,448 --> 01:19:15,472
You seen Lorenzo?

1508
01:19:15,649 --> 01:19:16,843
-Calm down.
-Shut up, man.

1509
01:19:17,017 --> 01:19:19,577
-Little girl, you seen Lorenzo?
-My friend's crazy.

1510
01:19:19,753 --> 01:19:20,777
-This is crazy.
-Move!

1511
01:19:20,954 --> 01:19:22,182
He's not out here.

1512
01:19:22,356 --> 01:19:25,052
-Kev, look, he's bigger than you.
-Y'all seen Lorenzo?

1513
01:19:26,026 --> 01:19:27,550
-Don't mind him.
-Hey, where you at?

1514
01:19:28,195 --> 01:19:29,856
Man, bring your ass outside!

1515
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:32,897
Talking all that shit! Where you at now?

1516
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:34,499
-Kevin, just calm down.
-Shut up!

1517
01:19:37,371 --> 01:19:39,601
-Right there.
-Don't get your ass kicked.

1518
01:19:40,974 --> 01:19:42,464
I got your ass now!

1519
01:19:43,243 --> 01:19:45,643
-Boy, what the hell's wrong with you?
-All right.

1520
01:19:45,846 --> 01:19:48,644
You think because you got money,
you can just knock people down? Huh?

1521
01:19:48,815 --> 01:19:51,079
You want ice cream?
Get in line like everybody else.

1522
01:19:51,251 --> 01:19:54,049
-I don't want no damn ice cream!
-It's good. Look, good as new.

1523
01:19:54,221 --> 01:19:56,621
-What's wrong with you? Get off me!
-Kevin!

1524
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:57,984
Damn.

1525
01:19:58,759 --> 01:19:59,748
Hey.

1526
01:20:01,094 --> 01:20:03,562
Just the man I wanted to see.
Kevin, take a ride with me.

1527
01:20:04,064 --> 01:20:05,497
Few things I wanna talk over.

1528
01:20:07,734 --> 01:20:09,998
-It's all right if I don't?
-No, not really.

1529
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:11,262
Get in the car.

1530
01:20:11,438 --> 01:20:13,736
-Okay, Kevin, I'm coming with you.
-Come on.

1531
01:20:13,907 --> 01:20:15,499
Stay right there.

1532
01:20:18,945 --> 01:20:23,439
First of all, let me apologize for that
incident outside the church the other day.

1533
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:26,642
I mean, that was entirely my fault.

1534
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:28,685
I should've never let you out of my sight.

1535
01:20:28,855 --> 01:20:30,288
From now on...

1536
01:20:30,691 --> 01:20:31,885
...wherever you go...

1537
01:20:32,359 --> 01:20:33,792
...I go.

1538
01:20:34,928 --> 01:20:36,190
Speaking of the church...

1539
01:20:36,797 --> 01:20:39,994
...is Jimmy the Driver gonna be all right?
Is he gonna pull through?

1540
01:20:40,167 --> 01:20:41,657
-He'll live.
-Okay.

1541
01:20:41,835 --> 01:20:44,133
He won't be on solid food for a while...

1542
01:20:44,304 --> 01:20:47,330
...and he probably will never
father children...

1543
01:20:47,507 --> 01:20:49,202
...but, hey, what can you do?

1544
01:20:52,546 --> 01:20:54,309
Ahem. Sweet Tee...

1545
01:20:54,715 --> 01:20:57,707
...how would you feel
if somebody owed you money--

1546
01:20:58,185 --> 01:20:59,447
Not me.

1547
01:20:59,953 --> 01:21:02,649
--and they couldn't pay you back?

1548
01:21:02,923 --> 01:21:04,754
Off the top of my head?

1549
01:21:06,226 --> 01:21:07,853
I'd probably, uh...

1550
01:21:08,462 --> 01:21:11,124
...saw his legs off at the kneecaps...

1551
01:21:11,465 --> 01:21:13,330
...and then grind them
into hamburger meat.

1552
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:17,158
And then I'd feed them to
my two 100-pound bullmastiffs.

1553
01:21:17,337 --> 01:21:20,795
Then I would force that guy
to watch them eat it.

1555
01:21:24,511 --> 01:21:28,242
That's pretty gnarly shit, ain't it?
Yeah, that's dastardly, I know it.

1556
01:21:28,415 --> 01:21:31,145
I saw that in the Philippines,
that's what gave me the idea.

1557
01:21:31,818 --> 01:21:37,586
Yeah, you ain't never heard a man scream
until you've heard him scream like that.

1558
01:21:37,858 --> 01:21:41,954
You've never heard a man throw up
the way I'm gonna throw up right now.

1559
01:21:42,129 --> 01:21:43,687
Not in my Bentley.

1560
01:21:43,864 --> 01:21:45,661
-Damn it, get out!
-All right.

1561
01:21:45,832 --> 01:21:47,197
Close my door.

1562
01:21:49,035 --> 01:21:50,161
Try to feel better.

1563
01:21:50,971 --> 01:21:53,405
I'll be around keeping my eye on you.
And remember...

1564
01:21:53,874 --> 01:21:56,934
...wherever you go, I go.

1565
01:21:59,179 --> 01:22:00,168
Let's go.

1566
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:05,142
-He's gonna kill me.
-He said that?

1567
01:22:05,318 --> 01:22:07,946
No, not exactly.
He said he was gonna cut my legs off...

1568
01:22:08,121 --> 01:22:09,748
...then feed them to the dogs.

1569
01:22:09,923 --> 01:22:12,483
Don't pump it up. He said
he'd cut you off at the kneecaps.

1570
01:22:12,659 --> 01:22:15,492
Kevin, you have to give back
all his money.

1571
01:22:16,496 --> 01:22:18,157
It ain't that simple.

1572
01:22:18,632 --> 01:22:19,860
I spent it.

1573
01:22:20,033 --> 01:22:22,194
-What?
-Yeah.

1574
01:22:22,369 --> 01:22:25,827
How did you spend $100,000
in one day?

1575
01:22:26,406 --> 01:22:27,930
It's not hard as you might think.

1576
01:22:28,108 --> 01:22:29,302
I got some earrings.

1577
01:22:29,476 --> 01:22:32,036
You're just gonna have to return
all that stuff you bought.

1578
01:22:32,212 --> 01:22:34,043
The same way you got into this mess...

1579
01:22:34,214 --> 01:22:36,978
...is the same way you're gonna
have to get yourself out of it.

1580
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:38,674
What?

1581
01:22:38,852 --> 01:22:41,844
Nothing. It's just that that's
the same thing Mr. Washington told me.

1582
01:22:42,022 --> 01:22:44,115
-Mr. Washington, the serial killer?
-Exactly.

1583
01:22:44,291 --> 01:22:46,657
Stop talking to him.
We're already in enough trouble.

1584
01:22:46,827 --> 01:22:49,796
Stop, all right?
Because he's not a serial killer.

1585
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,058
Wait a minute.

1586
01:22:55,735 --> 01:22:57,635
It was Semaj.

1587
01:22:58,004 --> 01:22:59,699
-It was Semaj!
-What about Semaj?

1588
01:22:59,873 --> 01:23:02,307
No. That's why I'm in
this mess right now.

1589
01:23:02,476 --> 01:23:04,740
Because of him.
He told everybody about my ticket.

1590
01:23:04,911 --> 01:23:07,243
I'm not following.
What does Semaj have to do with it?

1591
01:23:07,414 --> 01:23:08,938
Get up! We gotta leave, now.

1592
01:23:10,984 --> 01:23:13,919
Yo, man, if you're trying to do
what I think you gonna do...

1593
01:23:14,087 --> 01:23:15,816
...you must be out your damn mind.

1594
01:23:20,961 --> 01:23:23,259
So if the one he stole was fake...

1595
01:23:24,164 --> 01:23:27,361
...what was your whole nervous
breakdown about earlier today?

1596
01:23:28,735 --> 01:23:31,670
Running all over town,
cursing Lorenzo's name...

1597
01:23:32,072 --> 01:23:33,664
...knocking folks over...

1598
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:36,206
...and ruining ice cream cones?

1599
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:41,875
Had to make it look real, right?

1600
01:23:42,716 --> 01:23:44,707
Even had you fooled.

1601
01:23:46,152 --> 01:23:47,244
You.

1602
01:23:48,622 --> 01:23:49,646
What?

1603
01:23:51,291 --> 01:23:53,953
Slow down and tell me that
one more time.

1604
01:23:54,127 --> 01:23:55,924
He did what now?

1606
01:24:07,874 --> 01:24:09,842
Yeah, baby. Yeah, baby.

1607
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:13,645
Man, that is the aroma of the beef.
Y'all just hating.

1608
01:24:13,813 --> 01:24:15,440
Hell, no. I'm going vegetarian.

1609
01:24:15,615 --> 01:24:17,549
Did you make the potato salad too?

1610
01:24:17,717 --> 01:24:19,548
Kevin, you want something to drink?

1611
01:24:19,719 --> 01:24:21,710
No, I'm all right. I'm cool.

1612
01:24:22,789 --> 01:24:25,690
Hey, this my mama recipe.
Y'all better back off.

1613
01:24:25,859 --> 01:24:27,759
You think you slick?

1614
01:24:27,928 --> 01:24:30,829
You little bitch.
Think you gonna get over on me?

1615
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,434
Oh, man. Oh, come on, Lorenzo.

1616
01:24:35,602 --> 01:24:37,399
You see how big this nigga look
right now?

1617
01:24:37,571 --> 01:24:40,699
It's a family barbecue.
Grab a plate, get something to eat, all right?

1618
01:24:40,874 --> 01:24:44,139
We got potato salad, get you a piece
of chicken. Chill out, you know--

1619
01:24:44,311 --> 01:24:47,371
Oh, it's that type of party? Okay.
It's that type of party.

1620
01:24:50,483 --> 01:24:52,451
-Come on, Kev, throw one on him.
-What's up?

1621
01:24:52,619 --> 01:24:54,883
First, I'm about to tell you
what's gonna go down.

1622
01:24:55,055 --> 01:24:58,422
First, I'm gonna beat your ass
till I get tired.

1623
01:24:58,592 --> 01:25:00,492
And I ain't never gonna get tired.

1624
01:25:00,994 --> 01:25:05,294
Then I'm gonna take that ticket,
the real ticket, and walk up out of here.

1625
01:25:05,465 --> 01:25:07,490
Look, I'm gonna tell you like this, man.

1626
01:25:07,667 --> 01:25:08,691
You want my ticket?

1627
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:12,695
You gonna have to take my ticket, dog.
Straight up.

1628
01:25:12,906 --> 01:25:15,033
Be a man. That's right. That's right, Kev.

1629
01:25:16,009 --> 01:25:18,307
You gonna have to back up, Lorenzo.

1630
01:25:18,478 --> 01:25:20,776
It ain't going down like that today.

1631
01:25:20,947 --> 01:25:24,610
You gonna have to back up, man,
before I bust a cap in your ass, man.

1632
01:25:25,151 --> 01:25:27,346
Shoot me, "man."

1633
01:25:35,629 --> 01:25:37,187
Get over here.

1634
01:25:37,464 --> 01:25:38,488
Cognac, nigga?

1635
01:25:42,369 --> 01:25:43,927
Not the homeboy.

1636
01:25:44,537 --> 01:25:46,232
Kev, I'm gonna let you handle that.

1637
01:25:50,443 --> 01:25:51,967
Look out.

1638
01:25:53,713 --> 01:25:55,146
Oh, what now?

1639
01:25:56,383 --> 01:25:57,907
You know who I am?

1640
01:25:58,084 --> 01:26:00,416
-He don't know.
-Yeah, I know who you are.

1641
01:26:01,488 --> 01:26:03,479
Then you must know I don't play.

1642
01:26:04,057 --> 01:26:05,081
Now, this young man...

1643
01:26:05,258 --> 01:26:08,455
...happens to be my business partner
and a close personal friend of mine.

1644
01:26:08,628 --> 01:26:10,892
I think he's about tired of you
harassing him.

1645
01:26:11,064 --> 01:26:13,191
And frankly, so am I.

1646
01:26:13,733 --> 01:26:16,327
Look, I ain't got no beef with you.

1647
01:26:16,503 --> 01:26:18,027
This is between me and him.

1648
01:26:18,204 --> 01:26:19,432
But you do need to know...

1649
01:26:19,606 --> 01:26:22,404
...that he's gonna get
his ass whupped today.

1650
01:26:22,876 --> 01:26:24,503
And I'm gonna leave with that ticket.

1651
01:26:25,178 --> 01:26:28,670
Now, you see, that's the problem
with young folk today.

1652
01:26:28,848 --> 01:26:30,679
Absolutely no courtesy.

1653
01:26:31,451 --> 01:26:32,475
No respect!

1654
01:26:33,253 --> 01:26:34,845
Ooh!

1655
01:26:36,623 --> 01:26:39,217
Damn! Took all day
to make that potato salad!

1656
01:26:39,392 --> 01:26:41,519
Now, y'all can keep on partying
or go home.

1657
01:26:41,695 --> 01:26:43,788
There ain't gonna be no fight here today.

1658
01:26:44,397 --> 01:26:46,058
That's it.

1659
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,258
Look at this punk ass.

1660
01:26:48,435 --> 01:26:51,268
And y'all said he was supposed to be
some kind of a tough guy.

1663
01:27:00,947 --> 01:27:03,939
You know what I'd do
with a bitch like you in my "cellie"?

1664
01:27:04,117 --> 01:27:06,108
Make you snuggle up with me at night.

1665
01:27:06,286 --> 01:27:09,050
And I squeeze your balls.

1666
01:27:09,222 --> 01:27:10,280
I squeeze.

1667
01:27:11,257 --> 01:27:13,020
And I squeeze!

1668
01:27:14,728 --> 01:27:16,252
Oh, man!

1669
01:27:17,297 --> 01:27:20,994
Oh, hell, no. This nigga's some kind
of goddamn superthug.

1670
01:27:21,167 --> 01:27:25,661
-Tee! Get up, Tee.
-Go home, Lorenzo!

1671
01:27:27,574 --> 01:27:29,201
Now, where were we?

1672
01:27:30,009 --> 01:27:31,033
Oh, snap.

1673
01:27:35,715 --> 01:27:38,878
-Come on, Kev.
-Yeah, man, hit him back!

1674
01:27:39,819 --> 01:27:41,946
My grandmama hit harder than you.

1675
01:27:44,057 --> 01:27:45,217
Get back.

1676
01:27:52,232 --> 01:27:54,359
-That's right, kid. Whup his ass.
-That's right.

1677
01:27:55,235 --> 01:27:58,102
Come on, man. Come on.

1678
01:27:59,405 --> 01:28:00,599
Jesus, I can't--

1679
01:28:00,774 --> 01:28:02,867
-Stay down!
-Just stay down.

1680
01:28:03,076 --> 01:28:04,543
I gotta give it to you.

1681
01:28:04,711 --> 01:28:06,110
You got a lot of heart.

1682
01:28:06,846 --> 01:28:08,541
But heart only gets you so far, son.

1683
01:28:09,115 --> 01:28:12,778
-Don't give it to him, Kevin.
-What say we do this old school?

1684
01:28:14,521 --> 01:28:15,988
Yo!

1685
01:28:17,223 --> 01:28:19,521
Pick a number between one and 10.

1686
01:28:22,529 --> 01:28:24,258
Pick!

1687
01:28:27,167 --> 01:28:28,327
Three.

1688
01:28:28,601 --> 01:28:32,503
All right. That's how many seconds you got
to hand it over before I start blasting.

1689
01:28:32,672 --> 01:28:35,368
-Come on.
-Counting down.

1690
01:28:35,542 --> 01:28:37,669
Three. Two.

1691
01:28:38,945 --> 01:28:40,344
All right.

1692
01:28:46,619 --> 01:28:49,588
-Lorenzo, you should be ashamed!
-I was hoping I'd get to use this.

1694
01:28:59,966 --> 01:29:02,935
You know what?
I'm gonna hold onto both of these.

1695
01:29:03,236 --> 01:29:04,760
Just in case...

1696
01:29:05,171 --> 01:29:07,071
...you got a little funny with the tickets.

1697
01:29:09,142 --> 01:29:12,839
Nice doing business with you.
Oh, before I forget....

1698
01:29:17,283 --> 01:29:18,614
Bitches didn't fit anyway.

1699
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:22,483
Say, young blood.

1700
01:29:32,932 --> 01:29:33,956
You like that, huh?

1701
01:29:36,102 --> 01:29:37,831
That's good work.

1702
01:29:38,738 --> 01:29:40,899
Somebody read him a bedtime story.

1703
01:29:41,741 --> 01:29:43,368
Mr. Washington?

1705
01:29:54,721 --> 01:29:56,450
You're the man, Mr. Washington.

1706
01:29:57,824 --> 01:29:59,485
Yeah, Mr. Washington!

1707
01:29:59,659 --> 01:30:02,423
He's a bad mother-- Shut your mouth.

1708
01:30:04,063 --> 01:30:08,193
Didn't I tell you?
I hear everything. Everything.

1709
01:30:09,903 --> 01:30:13,270
Come on, out of here, Bobby Brown.
I know you got it.

1710
01:30:14,073 --> 01:30:16,837
Now, lookie here, boy.
Keep ahold of these things.

1711
01:30:17,010 --> 01:30:19,308
You put them in a safe place. You hear?

1712
01:30:19,479 --> 01:30:20,503
-All right?
-All right.

1713
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:23,080
Safe place.
There's a lot of crazies around here.

1714
01:30:23,249 --> 01:30:24,273
All right.

1716
01:30:29,422 --> 01:30:31,117
Still got it.

1717
01:30:31,291 --> 01:30:33,691
You let them know I still got it, right?
Let them know.

1718
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:36,522
Any of you young punks
want your ass whupped, step on in.

1720
01:30:37,897 --> 01:30:39,922
-They don't want none.
-No, they don't want none.

1721
01:30:40,099 --> 01:30:41,726
Let them know I still got it.

1722
01:30:49,742 --> 01:30:53,337
Damn. Mr. Washington's pretty cool
for a serial killer.

1723
01:30:53,513 --> 01:30:55,378
Baby. Kevin.

1724
01:30:55,548 --> 01:30:57,846
-Unh. Stacie.
-Are you okay?

1725
01:30:58,017 --> 01:30:59,644
-Kev.
-Damn.

1726
01:30:59,819 --> 01:31:02,151
-Please sign the ticket.
-Yes.

1727
01:31:06,759 --> 01:31:08,522
Well, here it go.

1728
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:11,061
Yes, you heard right.

1729
01:31:11,264 --> 01:31:13,960
He got the numbers from
a fortune cookie at the Hunan Grill.

1730
01:31:14,133 --> 01:31:16,067
So a month after graduating
high school...

1731
01:31:16,235 --> 01:31:19,568
...Kevin Carson is the youngest winner
in the Mondo Millions lottery.

1732
01:31:19,772 --> 01:31:21,467
Asked what he'd do with the money...

1733
01:31:21,641 --> 01:31:23,802
...he said he'd start
his own line of sneakers...

1734
01:31:23,977 --> 01:31:26,207
...and "Give a little something
to the Fillmore."

1735
01:31:27,013 --> 01:31:30,005
People not from here
may not understand.

1736
01:31:30,183 --> 01:31:33,152
This is a community.
This is our community.

1737
01:31:33,987 --> 01:31:35,352
As long as we stay together...

1738
01:31:35,521 --> 01:31:38,388
...no matter how many times
life knocks us down, we can't lose.

1739
01:31:38,825 --> 01:31:42,022
See, that's why I wanna
make this park safe for all kids.

1740
01:31:42,195 --> 01:31:44,425
And to make sure
that it stays that way...

1741
01:31:44,597 --> 01:31:46,758
... I would like to introduce
the head of security:

1742
01:31:46,933 --> 01:31:49,231
Mr. Jerome "Thump" Washington.

1743
01:31:49,402 --> 01:31:50,596
Please, everybody.

1745
01:31:57,844 --> 01:32:01,336
Hey, look, any of you young punks
wanna get knocked out, just let me know.

1747
01:32:06,219 --> 01:32:08,244
Oh, look. You wanna do the honors?

1748
01:32:08,421 --> 01:32:11,686
-Don't mind if I do.
-All right. Here we go.

1749
01:32:13,259 --> 01:32:14,283
There it is.

1750
01:32:18,031 --> 01:32:19,464
All right, all right.

1751
01:32:19,632 --> 01:32:23,762
Now, as you guys already know,
this is just the beginning.

1752
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:25,403
Myself...

1753
01:32:26,205 --> 01:32:27,672
...my CEO...

1754
01:32:28,074 --> 01:32:30,042
...my future attorney...

1755
01:32:30,209 --> 01:32:32,040
...we wanna take this to the next level.

1756
01:32:32,345 --> 01:32:34,939
That's right. That's why we started
the Carson Foundation...

1757
01:32:35,114 --> 01:32:39,881
...which helps fund our own businesses,
grant scholarships, and better yet...

1758
01:32:41,354 --> 01:32:44,289
...help change people's lives.

1759
01:32:44,891 --> 01:32:46,882
-And on another note--
-Yo.

1760
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:49,494
Thank you.
I'm sorry, but we gotta cut out early.

1761
01:32:49,662 --> 01:32:51,960
I gotta get to work so we have to go.
Come on, Kev.

1762
01:32:52,131 --> 01:32:54,725
Let me holler at my grandma.
Grandma, you're not coming?

1763
01:32:54,901 --> 01:32:57,165
Oh, child, please.
After I just got my hair done?

1764
01:32:57,370 --> 01:32:58,735
It's okay, we can get it done.

1765
01:32:58,905 --> 01:33:01,237
I don't see nothing in the Bible
about no helicopter.

1766
01:33:01,407 --> 01:33:03,841
So, wait, no, no, no. Listen.
You duck your head down.

1767
01:33:04,010 --> 01:33:06,171
That thing got them blades on it!
I know about it.

1768
01:33:06,379 --> 01:33:07,437
We really have to go.

1769
01:33:07,613 --> 01:33:09,843
-Go. Take care of your business.
-Love you.

1770
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:11,415
Thank you. Hair looks amazing.

1771
01:33:11,584 --> 01:33:13,814
Oh, hush up, boy. Handle your business.

1772
01:33:13,986 --> 01:33:15,920
-Thanks, everybody. Thank you!
-See you!

1773
01:33:16,522 --> 01:33:17,819
Come on, Kev.

1774
01:33:19,659 --> 01:33:22,253
Kev, don't ever change, baby.
You good. That's right.

1775
01:33:24,097 --> 01:33:26,031
Hey, Mr. Washington.

1776
01:33:28,534 --> 01:33:31,162
Hey there, Miss Carson. How you doing?

1777
01:33:31,337 --> 01:33:32,702
How you doing?

1778
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:35,768
Hm.

1779
01:33:35,942 --> 01:33:37,034
Time is money.

1780
01:33:38,377 --> 01:33:40,038
Let's fly, baby, fly.

1781
01:33:40,213 --> 01:33:41,475
Come on, let's go, let's go.

1782
01:33:41,647 --> 01:33:42,807
It's got everything.

1783
01:33:42,982 --> 01:33:44,506
I'm gonna see y'all Monday at work.

1784
01:33:44,684 --> 01:33:45,708
We don't get to ride?

1785
01:33:45,918 --> 01:33:47,385
-We love you.
-It was my idea.

1786
01:33:47,553 --> 01:33:49,145
-Y'all hold it down.
-It was my idea.

1787
01:33:49,322 --> 01:33:51,415
All right, kid. Do your thing, man.

1788
01:33:51,591 --> 01:33:53,684
-That's what it is.
-We got you. We got you.

1789
01:34:04,704 --> 01:34:07,969
Lord Almighty, them helicopter lights
go off and on like that.

1790
01:34:08,441 --> 01:34:13,071
That's my good wig, man.
Li'l Kim likes this right here, baby.
