PRIME SUSPECT
Episode 4 - Part 2

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,600
Inner Circles

3
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,356
Is that the one we ordered?

4
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,829
Oh, good, yes, thank you very much.
Darling?

5
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:46,476
- Paul.
- James.

6
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,030
- Can I offer you a glass of this?
- Not just at the moment, thanks.

7
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,520
Not again!

8
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,633
Mum...

9
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,870
- Mum, come on!
- No!

10
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,916
Please!

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,676
I need to go to the toilet.

12
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:44,875
I have to go now, Mum.

13
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:47,234
Can´t wait to get away, can you?

14
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,549
I´ve got an appointment.

15
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:51,948
I´ll sort things out, I promise.

16
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,630
You won´t.

17
00:01:54,718 --> 00:01:57,152
Oh, go, go on, go!

18
00:01:57,238 --> 00:01:59,672
I don´t want you here, anyway.

19
00:01:59,758 --> 00:02:01,988
Denis will be along in a minute.

20
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:04,069
Mother...

21
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:06,114
I am Denis.

22
00:02:13,198 --> 00:02:16,395
- The police are on their way.
- There are two of them. I heard voices.

23
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,397
Let´s go roud the back. Come on.

24
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,635
Right? These bastards aren´t going anywhere.

25
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,948
Alan, you go roud the front.

26
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:09,073
Norman, you stay here.

27
00:03:29,717 --> 00:03:31,673
Shit!

28
00:03:36,237 --> 00:03:38,193
- Micky...
- Shut up!

29
00:03:48,317 --> 00:03:50,273
Alan! He´s here!

30
00:03:52,277 --> 00:03:54,268
Alan, he´s coming out.

31
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:03,777
Bastards...

32
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,178
Get your....
hands off me!

33
00:04:06,198 --> 00:04:08,793
- Norman, check inside the house.
- Bastards!

34
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:10,709
- I´ll kill you!
- Listen, you!

35
00:04:10,798 --> 00:04:13,437
We don´t want your type aroud here.
Understand?

36
00:04:13,518 --> 00:04:15,668
Just so you remember...

37
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:18,226
I´d put that away if I was you.

38
00:04:18,318 --> 00:04:20,274
Denis?

39
00:04:36,597 --> 00:04:38,553
Are you there, Denis?

40
00:05:01,396 --> 00:05:03,352
Oh, my God...

41
00:05:34,796 --> 00:05:38,535
Everybody knows who´s doing it.
It´s those kids from the bloody estate.

42
00:05:38,616 --> 00:05:40,906
- Still no word from Raymond?
- Zilch.

43
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:42,747
Typical.

44
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:46,827
- What are we gona do, then?
- Not a lot we can do.

45
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,271
Phone it in, I suppose.

46
00:05:49,356 --> 00:05:52,826
What´s the betting we get lumbered
with some berk from AMIP?

47
00:05:54,076 --> 00:05:57,955
Oh, come on, Mike.
I´m a copper, not a bloody accountant.

48
00:05:58,036 --> 00:06:02,348
Look, I forecast the budget.
Don´t expect me to sell the bloody thing.

49
00:06:03,316 --> 00:06:06,388
Yeah, all right.
All right, 9:00am tomorrow morning.

50
00:06:08,116 --> 00:06:10,107
Thank you and good night.

51
00:06:22,995 --> 00:06:24,713
- Hello?
- Yeah, Tennison.

52
00:06:24,795 --> 00:06:28,026
Oh, yes, ma´am.
Hadley Green have called for help.

53
00:06:28,115 --> 00:06:30,185
- There´s been a murder.
- Where?

54
00:06:30,275 --> 00:06:33,904
- 17 Moss Bank Drive
- Mmm-hmm.

55
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:35,951
That´s EN4.

56
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:39,828
- Right.
- Tearing you away from your desk?

57
00:06:39,915 --> 00:06:42,349
Believe me, it will be a pleasure.

58
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,391
- See you.
- Good night, ma´am.

59
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:52,309
Thank you.

60
00:06:58,154 --> 00:07:00,714
- Where´s Forensic?
- He´s on his way, ma´am.

61
00:07:00,794 --> 00:07:02,705
- What, SO3?
- He was out.

62
00:07:02,794 --> 00:07:04,674
He´s picking his cameras
and his stuff up now.

63
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:05,875
I see.

64
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:11,391
What do you think of that scarf?

65
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:13,430
Fashion victim?

66
00:07:15,114 --> 00:07:17,753
I´m a member of the Neighbourhood Watch.

67
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:20,029
- Denis Carradine lived here alone?
- Yeah.

68
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:22,708
His mum went into a nursing home
about a year ago.

69
00:07:22,794 --> 00:07:25,467
Carradine was the manager
at the Hutingon Coutry Club.

70
00:07:25,554 --> 00:07:27,511
- How did you know that?
- The neighbours.

71
00:07:27,595 --> 00:07:31,031
Very helpful. Concerned about the state
of his garden. That sort of area.

72
00:07:31,115 --> 00:07:33,231
- Who´s your DCI?
- Peter Raymond.

73
00:07:33,915 --> 00:07:37,430
- Do you know him, ma´am?
- Yes, we´re acquainted.

74
00:07:37,515 --> 00:07:40,348
All right, get the male
suspect´s ID circulated.

75
00:07:40,435 --> 00:07:44,110
Keep this area completely sealed off
till Forensic gets here. If ever!

76
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:46,151
Oh, Detective.

77
00:07:48,195 --> 00:07:52,552
Better get the mother informed.
Send someone over. Not a complete plank.

78
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:55,024
- I´ll do it myself.
- See you back at the nick.

79
00:07:58,075 --> 00:07:59,872
Where is the nick?

80
00:08:09,634 --> 00:08:11,271
Sergeant?

81
00:08:13,113 --> 00:08:15,468
Why wasn´t I told she could be uderage?

82
00:08:15,553 --> 00:08:19,102
Listen, if she doesn´t want to talk,
how are you or I supposed to know?

83
00:08:19,193 --> 00:08:21,149
What´s that supposed to mean?

84
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:23,747
All I´m saying is,
she may or may not be uderage,

85
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,869
therefore we may not need a parent or...

86
00:08:25,953 --> 00:08:29,104
I want the duty social worker down
here immediately, please.

87
00:08:29,193 --> 00:08:31,343
You do have an incident room available?

88
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:34,630
Good, I want it up and runing
by 9:00 tomorrow morning.

89
00:08:35,753 --> 00:08:39,507
Get a hold of these two officers from AMIP.

90
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:43,903
That´s tonight, Sergeant.

91
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:47,311
Denis is...

92
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,349
Denis is not coming back, Olive.

93
00:08:50,793 --> 00:08:53,591
I... I don´t uderstand.

94
00:08:55,113 --> 00:08:58,310
Why should anyone want to do that
to my Denis?

95
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:03,265
- They were trying to rob him, Olive.
- He´s dead?!

96
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:07,068
Yeah.

97
00:09:07,153 --> 00:09:09,110
Yeah, I´m afraid he is.

98
00:09:10,354 --> 00:09:12,948
They didn´t hurt him, did they?

99
00:09:18,114 --> 00:09:20,674
It´s good to have you with us, Richard.

100
00:09:20,754 --> 00:09:23,473
- How are the twins?
- Certifiable.

101
00:09:23,554 --> 00:09:25,509
Nothing´s changed, then.

102
00:09:36,953 --> 00:09:40,590
Good morning.

103
00:09:40,673 --> 00:09:43,027
Richard, this is DS Booth, DC Bakari.

104
00:09:43,112 --> 00:09:45,467
- Hiya.
- All right.

105
00:09:46,392 --> 00:09:48,542
- You know Toby from AMIP.
- Yeah.

106
00:09:48,632 --> 00:09:50,224
Find it all right, Rich?

107
00:09:50,312 --> 00:09:52,428
Yeah, with the aid of a Sherpa.

108
00:09:52,512 --> 00:09:56,221
Right, where´s DS Cromwell?
I thought he was supposed to be here.

109
00:09:56,312 --> 00:09:58,303
She is. Morning, ma´am.

110
00:09:58,392 --> 00:10:00,144
DS Christine Cromwell.

111
00:10:01,312 --> 00:10:03,268
You´re late.

112
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,912
Someone took my parking place.

113
00:10:05,992 --> 00:10:07,789
Probably me.

114
00:10:07,872 --> 00:10:10,830
Looking forward to working
with you, Christine.

115
00:10:10,912 --> 00:10:13,028
- Optimist, are you?
- Try my best.

116
00:10:18,712 --> 00:10:20,668
Right...

117
00:10:21,712 --> 00:10:23,782
Denis Arthur Carradine.

118
00:10:25,352 --> 00:10:28,310
Quiet, respectable,
all the middle-class values.

119
00:10:29,832 --> 00:10:32,869
Approximate time of death,
between 8:00 and 9:15pm.

120
00:10:32,952 --> 00:10:35,546
He was strug up with
a piece of electrical flex.

121
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:39,386
Now, we have two suspects,
one in custody, Sheila Bower.

122
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:43,259
She´s not talking. We are treating it
as a drug-related burglary.

123
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,149
However, the way he was strug up
and his clothes

124
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:48,541
suggest some sort of sexual dimensión.

125
00:10:48,632 --> 00:10:52,227
- What, with that filth?
- No, that´s not what I´m suggesting.

126
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:54,985
Hang on a minute,
you´re saying he did it himself.

127
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:58,269
All I´m saying is that the scarf
and the clothes suggest...

128
00:10:59,352 --> 00:11:01,627
- It´s a possibility.
- Oh, come on.

129
00:11:01,712 --> 00:11:05,261
The girl was as high as a kite.
They had the poor bastard strung up.

130
00:11:05,352 --> 00:11:07,327
- They could´ve done anything to him.
- Right!

131
00:11:07,412 --> 00:11:10,988
Let´s not jump to conclusions
till we get Pathology.

132
00:11:11,072 --> 00:11:14,906
Our first priority is to pick up the youth.
Uniform is at the Larchmont Estate.

133
00:11:14,992 --> 00:11:18,541
The description is vague at best,
so what can you do? Check with neighbours.

134
00:11:18,632 --> 00:11:22,067
Also, let´s build up a profile
of Denis Carradine.

135
00:11:22,151 --> 00:11:25,109
Check with his workmates,
friends at the club. What is it?

136
00:11:25,191 --> 00:11:28,501
- The Hutington Coutry Club.
- Right, the Hutington Coutry Club.

137
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:30,900
- Did you get anything from the mother?
- Not a lot

138
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:34,904
The woman who runs the nursing home
said he´d been made redundant.

139
00:11:34,991 --> 00:11:37,221
He was behind with his mother´s fees.

140
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:40,781
Check into that. Come on! Come on!
Let´s get going.

141
00:11:40,871 --> 00:11:45,262
I... understood DCI Raymond
would be runing the investigation.

142
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:47,307
Not from me, you didn´t.

143
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:50,940
Oh, lan. Lan. Larchmont Estate.

144
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:54,467
Tell Uniform it´s door-to-door enquiries,
not mob-handed, OK?

145
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:56,541
- Soflly, Soflly?
- Not The A Team.

146
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,106
Sheila Carol Bower.

147
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,861
Born 25/10/77, Highbury, London.

148
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,943
Catalogue of juvenile offences

149
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,100
In care since ´89.

150
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,823
But you listen to me , we´re not talking
about petty thieving here.

151
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:24,744
Forget about coning some old fart
on a magistrates bench. This is murder!

152
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,064
That means prison. For life.

153
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,741
Not probation on some nice
little holiday camp somewhere.

154
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:37,096
We never done him.

155
00:12:37,808 --> 00:12:40,600
What? You were out collecting
for the elderly?

156
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,986
We never even touched him.

157
00:12:43,071 --> 00:12:45,460
So who pulled his pants down?

158
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,747
You enjoy that, Sheila?

159
00:12:53,991 --> 00:12:55,947
Yeah, of course you did.

160
00:12:56,711 --> 00:12:58,667
Old man like that.

161
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:01,740
Make him squirm.

162
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,627
Have some fun.

163
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,826
- Micky.
- Yes?

164
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,946
- Ask Micky.
- Who´s Micky?

165
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:21,540
Sheila...

166
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:30,220
8:42, DCI Raymond entering interview room.

167
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:36,025
This her, is it, Jane?

168
00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:40,339
- Sheila...
- We never did him, all right?!

169
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:42,340
Liar.

170
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:44,989
- It´s the truth.
- The truth?

171
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:47,981
You wouldn´t know
the truth if you fell on it.

172
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:50,344
Bang her up.

173
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:53,626
DC Raymond,
could I have a word with you for a minute?

174
00:13:55,789 --> 00:13:59,304
8:43, Superintendent Tennison
and DCI Raymond leaving interview room.

175
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:01,584
Another piece of shit from the Larchmont.

176
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:03,625
They´re scum, the lot of them.

177
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,665
Where were you last night?

178
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:08,265
My pager was knackered.

179
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:10,306
- I just handed it in.
- Well...

180
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,387
Well, if it was knackered,
why didn´t you call?

181
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,667
Because I didn´t know it was knackered
until this morning.

182
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,284
Jane, you came here last night
and did us a favour.

183
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:27,140
Thank you very much. But I´m back
on the case so we needn´t detain you, alright..

184
00:14:27,229 --> 00:14:29,868
You´re understaffed.
You asked for assistance.

185
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:31,985
I didn´t ask for anything.

186
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:34,344
This is a straightforward case.

187
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:36,704
- Oh, I´m not of that opinion.
- Bullshit!

188
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:40,464
I´m also not of the opinion that
this nick can handle this investigation.

189
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:43,426
Until I am, DCI Raymond,
I shall be handling things.

190
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,181
And in future,
when I am interviewing a suspect,

191
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:48,224
you do not interrupt.

192
00:14:53,308 --> 00:14:55,617
Soup spoons on the right.

193
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,346
Right.

194
00:14:57,428 --> 00:14:59,384
Outside in.

195
00:15:00,188 --> 00:15:02,144
Do them again.

196
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:10,708
Can I help you?
I take it you are members.

197
00:15:10,788 --> 00:15:12,699
Police, sir. You in charge here?

198
00:15:15,228 --> 00:15:17,184
I´ll get Mr Greenlees.

199
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:19,663
Prat...

200
00:15:24,308 --> 00:15:27,505
Morning. Lords and masters
keeping you at it, are they?

201
00:15:33,188 --> 00:15:36,180
Did you see much of Mr Carradine?

202
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,101
I thought you weren´t going to...
p- press charges.

203
00:15:39,288 --> 00:15:41,940
- How do you mean?
- Isn´t that what you´re here for?

204
00:15:42,027 --> 00:15:43,983
Hamish!

205
00:15:45,547 --> 00:15:47,538
You can wait in Mr Greenlees´ office.

206
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:58,140
They held him on the chair,
then hauled him up and tied him off.

207
00:15:58,228 --> 00:16:01,682
The face of the door is scored and you can see
the upper length of this flex is damaged.

208
00:16:01,768 --> 00:16:05,458
It picked up traces of the paint.
I think we´ll find they match.

209
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,823
So you´re ruling out autostrangulation?

210
00:16:07,908 --> 00:16:11,105
For his own sexual gratification?
No, no semen stains.

211
00:16:11,188 --> 00:16:14,942
- Pathology will tell us definitely.
- Can I get down now?

212
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:17,303
I thought you liked hanging around, Rich.

213
00:16:18,388 --> 00:16:21,697
Yeah, she´s got it written all over her.
No life but the job.

214
00:16:21,787 --> 00:16:26,019
Sounds familiar.
Mind you, nice legs for a superintendent.

215
00:16:27,107 --> 00:16:30,179
Still... No job for a woman, is it?

216
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:33,418
Originality is not your strong point, is it?

217
00:16:33,507 --> 00:16:37,216
Oh, hello. Carradine. Carradine.

218
00:16:39,187 --> 00:16:41,098
- Oh...
- Here, leave it out.

219
00:16:41,187 --> 00:16:43,542
He´s dead. He´s not gona complain, is he?

220
00:16:44,507 --> 00:16:48,341
Good morning. How can I help you, officers?

221
00:16:48,427 --> 00:16:51,544
DS Cromwell. DC Bakari, sir.

222
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:53,857
James Greenlees, managing director.

223
00:16:55,187 --> 00:16:59,782
We´re all obviously totally shocked
and angered by the news.

224
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,419
I understand you´ve already
apprehended the culprits.

225
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:06,703
- Who told you that?
- It´s close-knit commuity.

226
00:17:06,786 --> 00:17:08,902
Bad news travels fast.

227
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:12,944
I also have friends in the force.

228
00:17:13,986 --> 00:17:16,056
I understand these two creatures

229
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:18,421
were found in the house with Denis´s body

230
00:17:18,506 --> 00:17:21,384
and that they´d... defiled it?

231
00:17:21,466 --> 00:17:23,502
I´m afraid I can´t comment on that, sir.

232
00:17:23,586 --> 00:17:27,261
We´re merely gathering background
information on Mr Carradine.

233
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,665
Um...

234
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:30,658
How well did you know him?

235
00:17:30,747 --> 00:17:33,466
Oh, Denis was liked by everybody.

236
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:39,381
- He was a fine man.
- He wasn´t married, was he?

237
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:41,423
Did he have any women friends?

238
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:44,029
What are you suggesting?

239
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,780
We´re just trying to build up
a profile sir.

240
00:17:46,987 --> 00:17:50,184
- Mr Carradine retired?
- Oh, quite recently.

241
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:53,339
His mother was in a nursing home.
He´d been under stress.

242
00:17:53,427 --> 00:17:56,817
- He hadn´t been made redundant?
- On the contrary.

243
00:17:56,907 --> 00:17:59,626
He was a great loss. A great loss.

244
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:04,575
Oh. We understood he was having difficulties
paying his mother´s nursing bills.

245
00:18:05,306 --> 00:18:08,981
Did he have any financial difficulties
you were aware of?

246
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:13,616
No. But then one wouldn´t, of course,
encourage that kind of familiarity.

247
00:18:13,705 --> 00:18:16,742
We´d heard there´d been
some sort of problem with his work.

248
00:18:16,825 --> 00:18:19,100
Something about some charges being dropped.

249
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:22,939
We had a problem with our VAT return,
Constable.

250
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:26,813
Can I ask you on whose authority
you are making these enquiries?

251
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:27,905
- I´m sure DCI Raymond...

252
00:18:28,105 --> 00:18:30,905
DCI Raymond isn´t in charge of the case, Sir.

253
00:18:31,385 --> 00:18:34,457
- Well, who is?
- Superintendent Tennison sir

254
00:18:34,545 --> 00:18:35,978
She´s been seconded in.

255
00:18:36,065 --> 00:18:38,977
- Right, any prints?
- There´s prints all over the shop.

256
00:18:39,065 --> 00:18:42,216
We´ll run them through the computer,
but it´ll take time.

257
00:18:46,345 --> 00:18:48,700
Oh... Did you get this?

258
00:18:50,305 --> 00:18:52,261
Do it, would you? Anything else?

259
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:56,020
Well, it´s probably nothing,
but we didn´t get any off the flex.

260
00:18:56,105 --> 00:18:57,504
Must´ve wiped them.

261
00:18:57,585 --> 00:18:59,303
Hmm, money problems?

262
00:19:04,505 --> 00:19:06,382
Didn´t leave him much, did they?

263
00:19:06,465 --> 00:19:08,421
What they can´t steal, they smash.

264
00:19:09,505 --> 00:19:11,895
Christ, that´s sad.

265
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:15,581
- What´s that?
- His favourite band was Status Quo.

266
00:19:17,386 --> 00:19:19,946
- Who´s that?
- Guv.

267
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,494
I think I´ve got
a more detailed description.

268
00:19:43,704 --> 00:19:45,456
So, have you got that, lan?

269
00:19:45,544 --> 00:19:48,456
Long hair, an earring

270
00:19:48,544 --> 00:19:50,660
Scar on his arm.

271
00:19:50,744 --> 00:19:52,655
It´s not a lot to go on, Guv.

272
00:19:52,744 --> 00:19:56,703
Yeah, right. Right, I´ll tell them
to take it easy. See you later.

273
00:19:56,784 --> 00:20:00,299
We´re making enquiries about somebody
we believe to be in this area.

274
00:20:00,384 --> 00:20:03,342
- I don´t live here?
- What´s going on? Polly?

275
00:20:05,944 --> 00:20:07,900
Dope?

276
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:15,574
Yeah?

277
00:20:15,664 --> 00:20:20,055
He´s up above. Get up the stairs.
I´ll stay this end, cut him off.

278
00:20:23,584 --> 00:20:25,575
Hold it! Stop! Police!

279
00:20:28,424 --> 00:20:32,576
Oi! Get somebody down below!
Block off all the stairwells!

280
00:20:37,624 --> 00:20:39,694
Don´t let him get down!

281
00:20:41,464 --> 00:20:44,341
Shit! We´re gona lose him.
There´s too many exits.

282
00:20:46,903 --> 00:20:48,256
Oi, stop!

283
00:20:50,864 --> 00:20:52,820
- Stay back!
- Just take it easy!

284
00:20:52,904 --> 00:20:54,223
Come here!

285
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:56,260
Come on, don´t just stand there!

286
00:21:21,503 --> 00:21:24,256
You asked for house-to-house enquired
and that´s what you got.

287
00:21:24,343 --> 00:21:26,299
I didn´t want them to go in mob-handed.

288
00:21:26,383 --> 00:21:30,058
The Larchmont, in case you hadn´t realised,
is a hostile environment.

289
00:21:30,143 --> 00:21:34,022
I´m not sending my officers in
without adequate protection.

290
00:21:34,103 --> 00:21:36,378
You asked for Michael Thomas
and you´ve got him.

291
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,579
In a coma, thank you very much.

292
00:21:38,663 --> 00:21:41,018
Whatever happened to community policing?

293
00:21:47,663 --> 00:21:49,871
So where does that leave us
with these kids?

294
00:21:50,371 --> 00:21:52,519
One half-dead,
the other scared shitless.

295
00:21:52,554 --> 00:21:55,016
You´re breaking my heart!
They didn´t need to be in there!

296
00:21:55,103 --> 00:21:56,377
All right, all right!

297
00:21:58,262 --> 00:22:00,412
What else have we got?

298
00:22:00,502 --> 00:22:01,998
We have his correspondence.

299
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:04,266
Looks like he remortgaged
his mother´s house.

300
00:22:04,582 --> 00:22:06,777
I thought the old lady owned it.

301
00:22:06,862 --> 00:22:10,411
More to the point, where´s the money gone?

302
00:22:10,502 --> 00:22:13,016
180,000 quid. That´s a lot of money.

303
00:22:13,102 --> 00:22:16,856
Yeah, and he certainly wasn´t using it
to pay off his debt.

304
00:22:16,942 --> 00:22:19,410
He had final demands all over the shop.

305
00:22:19,502 --> 00:22:22,460
Check his bank statements,
talk to his solicitor,

306
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:26,296
find out exactly when Denis took possessión
of his mother´s house.

307
00:22:26,382 --> 00:22:28,896
A visitor, ma´am.
Superintendent´s Office.

308
00:22:28,982 --> 00:22:30,893
A Mr Greenlees.

309
00:22:35,303 --> 00:22:38,500
Of course, feel free to say anything
you think necessary...

310
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:41,017
Ah, Superintendent. Mr Greenlees.

311
00:22:41,823 --> 00:22:43,336
How do you do, Mr Greenlees?

312
00:22:43,423 --> 00:22:46,301
I´m Chairman
of the Police Consultative Committee.

313
00:22:46,383 --> 00:22:48,339
Well, I´ll leave you to it.

314
00:22:49,463 --> 00:22:51,419
Nice to see you, Bob. Peter.

315
00:22:55,263 --> 00:22:57,823
Well, what can I do for you, Mr Greenlees?

316
00:22:57,903 --> 00:23:00,337
Well, you may not be aware, Superintendent,

317
00:23:00,423 --> 00:23:03,220
but there´s a lot of fear in this community.

318
00:23:03,302 --> 00:23:05,258
Some would say justifiably so.

319
00:23:06,182 --> 00:23:10,733
People here feel police are fighting
a losing battle against crime.

320
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,380
Public confidence is very low.

321
00:23:13,581 --> 00:23:15,378
Well, we do our best.

322
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:16,689
Do you?

323
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:20,334
This morning, Superintendent,
two of your officers,

324
00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:25,097
DS Cromwell and a coloured chap,
came to see me in my office.

325
00:23:25,181 --> 00:23:29,094
I found them rifling through
a pile of the club´s private correspondence.

326
00:23:30,021 --> 00:23:33,650
Really? Did you confront the officers?

327
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:36,492
I didn´t.

328
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,334
To be honest, I couldn´t believe
what was happening.

329
00:23:39,421 --> 00:23:42,254
It´s not the such of behaviour you expect
from police officers.

330
00:23:42,341 --> 00:23:44,411
Quite. I appreciate that.

331
00:23:45,221 --> 00:23:48,770
Well, I assure you, I´ll look into the matter
and speak to the officers.

332
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,294
I do apologise.

333
00:23:50,381 --> 00:23:52,417
Fine. We´ll say no more about it, then.

334
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:57,096
We all want you to apprehend the murderers,
Superintendent, but...

335
00:23:57,181 --> 00:23:59,012
we are not the criminals.

336
00:23:59,101 --> 00:24:01,661
I see no reason
why we should be treated as such.

337
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:03,530
Quite.

338
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:05,498
I wasn´t rifling his office.

339
00:24:05,581 --> 00:24:08,175
- I just picked it up.
- So you don´t deny it, then?

340
00:24:08,261 --> 00:24:10,775
It wasn´t his property.
It was addressed to Carradine.

341
00:24:10,861 --> 00:24:13,092
Do you really think
he´d have given it to us?

342
00:24:13,182 --> 00:24:17,221
- You didn´t give him a chance, did you ?
- He´s the Chairman of the PCC.

343
00:24:17,302 --> 00:24:19,975
- That doesn´t make him God.
- Or make him a criminal either.

344
00:24:20,062 --> 00:24:24,021
are you listen to me, you may behave like this
with DCI Raymond but you do not with me.

345
00:24:24,102 --> 00:24:26,058
- Do you uderstand?
- Yes, Guv.

346
00:24:27,742 --> 00:24:31,416
Lucky he didn´t make a complaint.
Go on, out, the pair of you.

347
00:24:34,061 --> 00:24:36,925
If you´re looking for any favours,
you´re looking in the wrong place.

348
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:38,457
Understand?

349
00:24:38,621 --> 00:24:40,576
One more, you´re out.

350
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,532
Basically, Denis was a very kind man.

351
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,975
He had his problems. But then we all do.

352
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,129
Problems?

353
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,371
Well, he was 46 years old
and still living with his mother.

354
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,772
I think underneath
he was quite a lonely person.

355
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,813
We were actually at school together.
My father was his parents´ solicitor.

356
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,256
It seemed like a natural progressión
that I should take over.

357
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,659
- It´s very sad.
- It is.

358
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,935
Well, thanks for your help, Mrs Henry.

359
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,251
- I won´t keep you any Ionger.
- My pleasure. Let me show you out.

360
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,050
Polly. What are you doing?

361
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:29,735
Borrowing a fiver. You were busy, Mummy.

362
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,892
I´m not supposed to disturb you
when you´re busy, remember?

363
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,609
- Children. Who´d have them?
- Not me.

364
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,656
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

365
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,013
Yes, well, will you make sure

366
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,092
the magistrate understands
we need Sheila Bower in our custody.

367
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,135
Thank you, Constable.

368
00:25:47,219 --> 00:25:49,175
Christ, whose side are they on?

369
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:53,010
Definitely not ours.

370
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,137
I get the distinct impressión
that we´re the bad guys.

371
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,413
Richard.

372
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,456
Do you fancy a drink?

373
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,216
I´ve got to re-tile the bathroom.

374
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,176
Guv, are you all right?

375
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,058
All right? What do you mean?
Of course I´m all right.

376
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,968
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah, see you tomorrow.

377
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:33,167
Micky Thomas, ma´am. He´s dead.

378
00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:41,574
- Thank you, Sergeant.
- Saves us the expense of a trial.

379
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:47,095
Oh, shit!

380
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:15,369
Yes?

381
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:17,255
- A whiskey and soda, please.
- Ice?

382
00:27:17,338 --> 00:27:19,294
No.

383
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,566
I hear young Micky´s turned terminal.

384
00:27:23,658 --> 00:27:25,614
Looks like there´ll be an inquiry.

385
00:27:25,698 --> 00:27:28,895
I´ll manage. No thanks to wallies like you.

386
00:27:28,978 --> 00:27:30,934
You won´t.

387
00:27:31,018 --> 00:27:32,691
A word of advice.

388
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:36,533
Don´t think you can come down here
and teach us how to do our jobs.

389
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:39,816
I´m gona have to go, Pete. Bye.

390
00:27:45,979 --> 00:27:48,971
- It´s not what you think.
- How´s your wife, by the way?

391
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:52,578
She´s fine. Still getting it regularly.

392
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:54,615
Which you´re obviously not.

393
00:28:05,218 --> 00:28:07,652
Large Scotch, Scotch and soda
and a gin and tonic.

394
00:28:07,738 --> 00:28:09,968
Yes, all right, I´m coming.

395
00:28:10,058 --> 00:28:12,618
Large Scotch, Scotch and soda
and a gin and tonic.

396
00:28:12,698 --> 00:28:14,609
There is a queue, you know.

397
00:28:14,697 --> 00:28:17,416
Dad, please. People are complaining.

398
00:28:17,497 --> 00:28:20,375
Who? I own 30% of this club.

399
00:28:20,457 --> 00:28:24,973
I greatly resent being told how to behave
by my son in my own club.

400
00:28:25,057 --> 00:28:27,617
- Now, I´ll have my drinks, please.
- Dad!

401
00:28:27,697 --> 00:28:29,335
P- Please!

402
00:28:31,337 --> 00:28:35,376
PauI´s under enormous stress.
You know, with this inquiry business.

403
00:28:35,457 --> 00:28:37,766
You should stop him drinking.

404
00:28:37,857 --> 00:28:41,054
- I mean, you are his wife.
- What difference does that make?

405
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:49,448
I tell you, I´ve had four months of hell
since he was suspended.

406
00:28:49,537 --> 00:28:52,256
Our sex life is practically nonexistent.

407
00:28:52,337 --> 00:28:55,215
Some nights,
he doesn´t even bother to come home.

408
00:28:55,297 --> 00:28:58,369
Come on, Hamish. Get it right.
For Pete´s sake.

409
00:28:58,457 --> 00:29:01,654
No, no. Your money is no good around here,
Paul. These are on me.

410
00:29:02,497 --> 00:29:04,806
Do the honours, Hamish.

411
00:29:05,617 --> 00:29:08,848
The boys in blue taking a night off,
are they, Pete?

412
00:29:08,937 --> 00:29:12,009
I´m sure that would make
Denis Carradine very happy.

413
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,404
- Oh, hello...
- This is Dr Patrick Schofield.

414
00:30:07,496 --> 00:30:10,090
Could you please leave a message
after the tone?

415
00:30:12,136 --> 00:30:14,775
Hello, Dr Patrick Schofield.

416
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:17,290
This is...

417
00:30:17,376 --> 00:30:19,970
Superintendent Jane Tennison calling.

418
00:30:21,096 --> 00:30:22,893
Um...

419
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,932
I just want...

420
00:30:25,976 --> 00:30:28,809
I was going to leave a message that...

421
00:30:30,736 --> 00:30:33,330
Er... I´ll call you back.

422
00:30:35,096 --> 00:30:37,052
Bye.

423
00:30:41,456 --> 00:30:43,412
You idiot.

424
00:30:45,215 --> 00:30:46,887
I hope he´s not driving tonight.

425
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:49,330
- We´ll get a cab.
- Very wise.

426
00:30:51,055 --> 00:30:54,014
- Good-Iooking man.
- He´s a wanker.

427
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,496
Paul, will you stop using such language?

428
00:30:57,576 --> 00:31:00,534
- I can´t bear it.
- Oh, dear! You can´t bear it?

429
00:31:00,616 --> 00:31:02,174
How infra-dig of me!

430
00:31:09,616 --> 00:31:11,049
If you´ll excuse me, Maria.

431
00:31:12,256 --> 00:31:14,212
Sorry.

432
00:31:15,336 --> 00:31:18,806
- I´m sorry.
- Don´t apologise to me. I´m not your wife.

433
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,658
Do yourself a favour, Paul.

434
00:31:22,808 --> 00:31:27,110
Stop drinking before you really blow it.

435
00:31:28,175 --> 00:31:30,166
- Now, listen.
- I´m sorry.

436
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:33,969
It´s just that Denis being
murdered like that...

437
00:31:34,055 --> 00:31:36,523
Paul, listen. I´ve got to talk to you.

438
00:31:38,575 --> 00:31:41,214
Er... Lyne gone?

439
00:31:41,295 --> 00:31:46,733
She had a headache. Everyone´s upset
about what happened to poor Denis.

440
00:31:46,815 --> 00:31:48,487
I know, I know, it´s beyond belief.

441
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:51,371
Peter Raymond tells me one of the thugs

442
00:31:51,455 --> 00:31:54,652
jumped off a balcony at the Larchmont,
trying to escape.

443
00:31:54,735 --> 00:31:58,933
- Did they catch him?
- Well, he died, ufortuately.

444
00:32:00,095 --> 00:32:02,289
I suppose that´s some sort of justice.

445
00:32:08,814 --> 00:32:12,807
There are two distinct lines
of bruises on the neck.

446
00:32:12,894 --> 00:32:15,044
One upper, one lower.

447
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:18,649
Note the particlary hemorraging
flowering up from the lower contusions

448
00:32:18,734 --> 00:32:20,690
to cover the neck and face.

449
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:24,323
This is absolutely consistent
with death by strangulation.

450
00:32:24,414 --> 00:32:27,087
The pressure of blood
in the vessels above the ligature

451
00:32:27,174 --> 00:32:29,210
is massively increased and they burst.

452
00:32:30,294 --> 00:32:35,528
However, in this case, the flex was found
around the upper area of bruising.

453
00:32:36,335 --> 00:32:39,566
There should be no haemorrhaging below it.

454
00:32:39,655 --> 00:32:42,488
Any significance
to the scarf tied around the flex?

455
00:32:42,575 --> 00:32:46,454
Stops the skin burning.
It´s not ucommon in autostrangulation.

456
00:32:46,535 --> 00:32:50,847
The person wants the sexual stimulation
of the hypoxic state,

457
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:52,926
but he also wants to control the pain.

458
00:32:53,015 --> 00:32:55,768
I thought you said
this wasn´t self-inflicted.

459
00:32:55,855 --> 00:32:57,925
It wasn´t.

460
00:32:58,015 --> 00:33:02,246
Whoever did this was trying
to make it look as though it was.

461
00:33:03,534 --> 00:33:05,889
Scratches and abrasions
to the rear of the neck

462
00:33:05,974 --> 00:33:08,169
and bruising to the shins.

463
00:33:10,214 --> 00:33:12,409
Looks as if he was garrotted from behind.

464
00:33:12,494 --> 00:33:15,566
So the assailant is likely
to have been a man?

465
00:33:15,654 --> 00:33:19,043
That´s a very sexist assumption,
Superintendent.

466
00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:21,089
Well, I´m so sorry.

467
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:24,085
86.7%  likely to have been a man.

468
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:26,368
Hmm.

469
00:33:28,893 --> 00:33:31,930
Ah, Jane, fancy a spot of breakfast?

470
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:36,563
- Do I have a choice?
- No.

471
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:50,682
- Well, I hope you´re paying, Mike.
- I am.

472
00:33:59,613 --> 00:34:01,569
So, to what do I owe this honour?

473
00:34:03,093 --> 00:34:06,768
Michael Thomas... You realise
there is going to have to be an inquiry.

474
00:34:06,853 --> 00:34:10,812
Good. Superintendent Mallory
and his mates deserve all they get.

475
00:34:10,893 --> 00:34:14,682
- You were heading the investigation, Jane.
- That wasn´t down to me.

476
00:34:14,774 --> 00:34:18,369
- That was down to the local plod.
- Not what I hear from DCI Raymond.

477
00:34:20,054 --> 00:34:22,002
DCI Raymond´s an arsehole.

478
00:34:22,003 --> 00:34:24,252
Been transferred out
of every nick he´s been in.

479
00:34:24,287 --> 00:34:28,207
Hold on. Your opinion of him
is totally irrelevant.

480
00:34:28,294 --> 00:34:31,569
He is the local DCI
and you´ve overstayed your welcome.

481
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:36,727
Now, you´ve nicked the culprits,
so let him get on with it.

482
00:34:36,813 --> 00:34:38,929
I´m very sorry to tell you this, Mike,

483
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:41,606
but Micky Thomas
did not kill Denis Carradine.

484
00:34:41,692 --> 00:34:44,570
- What do you mean?
- Look

485
00:34:44,652 --> 00:34:47,610
He wasn´t tortured.
He was not sexually abused.

486
00:34:47,692 --> 00:34:50,411
- Can I help you?
- I´ll have the full breakfast, please.

487
00:34:50,492 --> 00:34:52,005
And for me, please.

488
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:56,882
Whoever did this strangled him,
then made it look like a sex game. Why?

489
00:34:56,972 --> 00:35:00,408
Plus he´s remortgaged
his mother´s house for 180 grand

490
00:35:00,492 --> 00:35:02,926
and he can´t pay his bills.

491
00:35:03,012 --> 00:35:05,446
Where´s that money gone? Doesn´t add up.

492
00:35:05,532 --> 00:35:09,320
All right... All right,
but you´ve got two days, Jane.

493
00:35:09,412 --> 00:35:13,530
- And I want a favour in return.
- What?

494
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,365
The Police Consultative Committee
meet tonight.

495
00:35:16,452 --> 00:35:19,330
I told Mr Greenlees
you would be their guest.

496
00:35:20,332 --> 00:35:22,926
Greenlees? Has he spoken to you?

497
00:35:23,012 --> 00:35:25,003
Someone seems to have got up his nose.

498
00:35:25,092 --> 00:35:27,048
So keep him sweet, all right?

499
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:31,005
Politics, Jane.
It´s what this job´s all about.

500
00:35:31,092 --> 00:35:33,322
Use your social skills.

501
00:35:34,972 --> 00:35:36,928
If you´ve got any.

502
00:35:38,812 --> 00:35:42,885
- I know there´s gona be an inquiry.
- You´re absolutely right there will.

503
00:35:45,412 --> 00:35:49,882
Thomas died whilst you were arresting him.
So get your story straight.

504
00:35:49,971 --> 00:35:52,439
- The van just came out of nowhere.
- Write it down.

505
00:35:52,531 --> 00:35:55,092
Good morning.

506
00:35:55,172 --> 00:35:56,668
Oh, contrary to rumour,

507
00:35:56,669 --> 00:35:58,528
I am still on the case,
so let´s go on with it.

508
00:35:58,692 --> 00:36:03,129
Get off the phone, Christine.
The pathologist has confirmed murder.

509
00:36:03,212 --> 00:36:06,568
He sets the time of death
at approximately 8pm.

510
00:36:06,652 --> 00:36:10,327
now, can we place Sheila Bower
at the scene of the crime at that time?

511
00:36:10,412 --> 00:36:13,882
A woman was seen at the house
earlier that day. Well-dressed, 40ish.

512
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:15,405
So, no, we can´t.

513
00:36:15,492 --> 00:36:18,370
And Micky Thomas does not have
a scar on his arm or an earring.

514
00:36:18,452 --> 00:36:21,329
So, if our witness is to be believed,
it´s not him either.

515
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:24,608
I don´t buy it.
Thomas´s prints were all over the place.

516
00:36:24,691 --> 00:36:27,763
- Yeah, but not on the flex.
- He probably wiped it.

517
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:31,241
And left the rest?
No, my guess is they only just got there.

518
00:36:31,331 --> 00:36:35,165
The pathologist has said he was
strangled first and strung up after,

519
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:37,048
to make it look like some sex game.

520
00:36:37,131 --> 00:36:40,601
Can you imagine a pair of kids doing that?
Might´ve bashed his head in,

521
00:36:40,691 --> 00:36:42,682
but not that, that´s too calculated.

522
00:36:42,771 --> 00:36:45,160
Brilliant. So where does that leave us?

523
00:36:45,251 --> 00:36:48,402
Looking for the real killer, lan.

524
00:36:48,491 --> 00:36:51,210
Not just easy targets.
Novel idea, isn´t it?

525
00:36:54,571 --> 00:36:57,324
Micky Thomas is dead, Sheila.

526
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:01,207
I´m sorry.

527
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:06,365
You bastards! You bloody bastards!

528
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,327
You bastards!

529
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:12,526
You bastards! You bastards!

530
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:16,247
- Put her in the chair. All right.
- You bastards...

531
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:18,969
She´s now sitting in the chair.
Let her go. Let her go.

532
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:22,962
You couldn´t get him one way
so you got him another.

533
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,601
It was an accident, Sheila,
and that´s the truth.

534
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:37,405
You would say that.

535
00:37:37,491 --> 00:37:40,767
And those bastards didn´t do this to my leg,
did they?

536
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:47,728
- Do you want to make a complaint?
- So you can say I fell over a wall?

537
00:37:47,811 --> 00:37:50,086
Forget it, you ain´t stitching me up.

538
00:37:50,171 --> 00:37:52,969
I didn´t see nothing and
I didn´t do anything!

539
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,688
What you looking at?

540
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:09,083
Squatting with Micky, were you, Sheila?

541
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:11,968
Samuel Johston House?

542
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,006
Micky claiming the housing, was he?

543
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:19,764
Yeah, up to your neck in shit and syringes.

544
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:22,124
And hawking your dole cards come Fridays.

545
00:38:22,209 --> 00:38:24,962
- Know it, do you?
- I grew up there!

546
00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:28,200
So stop pissing about
with all this stitch-me-up bullshit.

547
00:38:29,689 --> 00:38:33,204
You were there. Micky was there.
His prints were all over the shop.

548
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:34,438
Bollocks!

549
00:38:35,609 --> 00:38:37,333
You don´t get it, do you?

550
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:39,809
You think these bastards
are stitching you up,

551
00:38:39,844 --> 00:38:41,685
all the time you´re doing it for them!

552
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:44,237
They want you to be guilty, Sheila.

553
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:46,160
They all do, everyone.

554
00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:50,646
You´re just another piece of shit
from the Larchmont.

555
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:53,766
And they´re gona flush you away.

556
00:38:58,089 --> 00:38:59,886
Where were you 8pm Sunday night?

557
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:07,000
Doing a house in Turner St.

558
00:39:08,649 --> 00:39:12,085
Micky got in through the kitchen
but an alarm went off, so we legged it.

559
00:39:12,169 --> 00:39:14,000
That´s why we tried the other place.

560
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:18,609
We were speeding.
We didn´t even know he was there.

561
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:32,878
You knew what you were
talking about in there.

562
00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:34,925
That´s always an advantage.

563
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:39,324
Turner Close.

564
00:39:40,248 --> 00:39:43,206
Uniform confirmed a break-in
at 8:10 on Sunday night.

565
00:39:43,288 --> 00:39:45,244
The alarm was triggered.

566
00:39:46,528 --> 00:39:48,484
I knew it.

567
00:39:49,928 --> 00:39:51,884
Raymond didn´t.

568
00:39:53,408 --> 00:39:56,366
Look, I slept with him, ma´am,
but I´m not in his pocket.

569
00:40:00,168 --> 00:40:02,124
So, do you really believe all that?

570
00:40:03,488 --> 00:40:06,924
To the Country Club lot,
if you´re Larchmont, you´re guilty.

571
00:40:07,008 --> 00:40:09,522
Yeah, but they´re not running  the case.

572
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:10,802
I am.

573
00:40:10,888 --> 00:40:13,686
And do you think
you´re gona get thanked for this?

574
00:40:13,768 --> 00:40:17,158
I´m telling you, these people think
they own the place, and us.

575
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:21,321
I mean, Greenlees complains about
the letter, but is he coming clean?

576
00:40:22,728 --> 00:40:25,765
- About what?
- There was no VAT investigation.

577
00:40:25,848 --> 00:40:27,804
I checked.

578
00:40:29,048 --> 00:40:31,004
- Oh, really?
- Guv?

579
00:40:32,928 --> 00:40:35,123
Come on in, Rich, you´re one of the giris.

580
00:40:36,808 --> 00:40:39,800
Sorry, but there´s something
you should take a look at.

581
00:40:45,168 --> 00:40:49,922
On 23rd June, 180 grand gets paid
into Carradine´s bank account.

582
00:40:50,007 --> 00:40:53,761
Right, and on the very same day,
he writes a cheque for the same amount

583
00:40:53,847 --> 00:40:55,724
to an H Torres.

584
00:40:55,807 --> 00:41:00,598
Hernandez Torres & Partners
are the company that bought Burdett House.

585
00:41:00,688 --> 00:41:02,724
I got the details from the Land Registry.

586
00:41:02,808 --> 00:41:04,480
They´re based in the Bahamas.

587
00:41:04,568 --> 00:41:08,880
Their contact number in this country
is Pitt, Henry, James & Partners.

588
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:13,200
Maria Henry. Denis´s solicitor.
See what she knows.

589
00:41:13,288 --> 00:41:16,564
Get this VAT business sorted out,
once and for all. Not you, Chris.

590
00:41:16,648 --> 00:41:20,925
Not with your sneaky little fingers.
Don´t want another complaint, do we?

591
00:41:21,007 --> 00:41:22,963
Thank you, Jane.

592
00:41:25,447 --> 00:41:29,520
So, you can tell us nothing
of Hernandez Torres & Partners, then?

593
00:41:29,607 --> 00:41:32,838
Other than they use this firm
as a local office, no.

594
00:41:32,927 --> 00:41:34,406
It´s quite a common practice.

595
00:41:34,487 --> 00:41:38,082
Why would it be common practice
for Panamanian lawyers to do that?

596
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:40,556
I´m afraid I can´t answer that, Sergeant.

597
00:41:40,647 --> 00:41:43,366
I´m bound by the Client Confidentiality Act.

598
00:41:43,447 --> 00:41:45,677
You´d get me struck off.

599
00:41:45,767 --> 00:41:48,235
Look, can I ask what all this is about?

600
00:41:48,327 --> 00:41:52,081
Mr Carradine seems to have paid
a large sum of money to this company.

601
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:53,919
- We´d like to know why.
- I´m sorry.

602
00:41:54,007 --> 00:41:57,761
- As I say, I can´t comment on that.
- I don´t follow, Mrs Henry.

603
00:41:59,047 --> 00:42:01,163
You represented Denis and his mother.

604
00:42:01,247 --> 00:42:03,555
You also represent the Torres Partners.

605
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,683
Denis pays Torres £180,000.

606
00:42:07,446 --> 00:42:10,358
And yet you seem to be saying
you knew nothing about it.

607
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:12,437
What I´m actually saying, Sergeant,

608
00:42:12,526 --> 00:42:14,596
is that for me to make any comment at all

609
00:42:14,686 --> 00:42:17,200
would be a breach
of my client´s confidentiality

610
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:19,242
and therefore unlawful.

611
00:42:20,366 --> 00:42:25,121
Look, off the record,
if, as I think you´re suggesting, Sergeant,

612
00:42:25,206 --> 00:42:27,845
Denis chose to buy into an offshore company,

613
00:42:27,926 --> 00:42:31,202
then he probably did so
to keep his investment private.

614
00:42:31,286 --> 00:42:33,925
He´s quite within his rights.
It´s perfectly legal.

615
00:42:34,006 --> 00:42:35,724
I wouldn´t have to know about it.

616
00:42:37,927 --> 00:42:40,680
Well, thank you
for being so frank, Mrs Henry.

617
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:44,123
Could you tell us anything
about the sale of Burdett House?

618
00:42:44,207 --> 00:42:45,765
Not really.

619
00:42:45,847 --> 00:42:50,477
Other than some minor conveyancing,
the office had nothing to do with it.

620
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:53,001
Any idea how much they paid for it?

621
00:42:53,087 --> 00:42:55,396
Somewhere in the region of £300,000.

622
00:42:57,527 --> 00:42:59,482
Jane I said no calls

623
00:43:01,526 --> 00:43:05,075
Look, I´m sorry to be blunt,
and believe me, I´d like to help,

624
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:08,124
but what´s all this
got to do with Denis´s murder?

625
00:43:08,206 --> 00:43:10,162
That´s what we need to find out.

626
00:43:11,726 --> 00:43:15,560
Hamish, either the police
were called in or they weren´t.

627
00:43:15,646 --> 00:43:17,159
Now, which one was it?

628
00:43:17,246 --> 00:43:20,476
Look, I´ve been told
n- not to say anything, all right?

629
00:43:20,565 --> 00:43:22,840
No, it´s not all right.

630
00:43:22,925 --> 00:43:24,563
If no-one is gona talk to us,

631
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:29,480
how the hell are we expected to find
who murdered Denis Carradine?

632
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,521
I thought you already had.

633
00:43:33,525 --> 00:43:35,197
Are you gona tell us?

634
00:43:37,245 --> 00:43:38,963
They treated him like shit.

635
00:43:39,885 --> 00:43:42,718
You know, a bit like me, really.

636
00:43:44,245 --> 00:43:47,362
They used to laugh
and say we´d make a good team.

637
00:43:49,685 --> 00:43:54,475
He showed them, though,
he had his hand in the till for m-months.

638
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,396
They never even knew.

639
00:43:56,485 --> 00:43:59,238
He used to fiddle the accounts to h-hide it.

640
00:43:59,325 --> 00:44:02,078
So, when did they discover this?

641
00:44:03,045 --> 00:44:06,242
Last week. They got Raymond
in to sort it out.

642
00:44:06,325 --> 00:44:07,963
DCI Raymond?

643
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:09,876
- Yeah...
- Hamish!

644
00:44:11,085 --> 00:44:12,916
Look, I´ve g-g...

645
00:44:15,005 --> 00:44:17,679
- Got to go.
- Yo, yo!

646
00:44:19,206 --> 00:44:21,003
These are firing, man!

647
00:44:22,606 --> 00:44:27,043
- You can do this professional.
- Yeah? Tell my old m-man.

648
00:44:27,126 --> 00:44:30,357
He thinks working here is all I´m good for.

649
00:44:30,446 --> 00:44:33,006
Well, he´s wrong. Who is your dad?

650
00:44:35,685 --> 00:44:37,357
P- Paul.

651
00:44:39,804 --> 00:44:42,398
- Paul Endicott.
- Hey, I know her.

652
00:44:42,484 --> 00:44:45,521
That´s... What´s her name? Polly.

653
00:44:45,604 --> 00:44:48,596
- The daughter of that solicitor.
- Hamish!

654
00:44:48,684 --> 00:44:52,393
Maria Henry, yeah. Yeah. Nice woman.

655
00:44:53,444 --> 00:44:55,674
Close friend of my father´s.

656
00:44:59,684 --> 00:45:02,152
No, I´m just her daughter.

657
00:45:02,244 --> 00:45:04,553
I´m not responsible for the telephone bill.

658
00:45:11,484 --> 00:45:14,362
Look, I´m gona have to go, OK?
Yeah, I´ll tell her.

659
00:45:23,484 --> 00:45:27,318
- Your mum not in?
- No. She was.

660
00:45:27,404 --> 00:45:29,201
- She´s gone to work.
- Good.

661
00:45:30,364 --> 00:45:32,320
Hair´s nice.

662
00:45:34,324 --> 00:45:36,280
You gona invite me in, then?

663
00:45:49,003 --> 00:45:50,834
Why wasn´t I told that Carradine...

664
00:45:50,923 --> 00:45:53,562
was caught embezzling funds from the club?

665
00:45:53,643 --> 00:45:55,952
- What?
- You heard me.

666
00:45:56,603 --> 00:45:58,993
You went there last week.
You interviewed him.

667
00:45:59,084 --> 00:46:01,075
He was subsequently sacked.

668
00:46:02,164 --> 00:46:04,120
Who told you that?

669
00:46:09,804 --> 00:46:12,159
They wanted it kept discreet.

670
00:46:12,244 --> 00:46:15,042
- I didn´t think it was relevant.
- Bollocks!

671
00:46:15,124 --> 00:46:18,002
I´m the senior officer.
I´ll decide what´s relevant.

672
00:46:20,163 --> 00:46:22,199
If you´re covering up for someone,

673
00:46:22,283 --> 00:46:25,593
I swear, I´ll mark your card good.

674
00:46:31,123 --> 00:46:35,082
- I´ve got a tener. What is it?
- Speed or something. Who cares?

675
00:46:35,163 --> 00:46:38,872
A tener. We´re not gona get
very much with that, are we?

676
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:41,955
Look, I don´t like him coming here, Poll.

677
00:46:42,043 --> 00:46:45,672
Don´t be stupid. These old farts
will never know the difference.

678
00:46:45,763 --> 00:46:49,358
My old man would.
Any old excuse and I´ll be out on my ear.

679
00:46:49,443 --> 00:46:51,513
Yeah, well, he´s all talk.

680
00:46:51,603 --> 00:46:53,958
One of these days,
he´ll open his lying mouth

681
00:46:54,043 --> 00:46:55,601
and I´m gona put my fist in it.

682
00:46:55,683 --> 00:46:57,913
- Hello?
- Hello?

683
00:46:58,003 --> 00:46:59,561
Er... Yeah?

684
00:46:59,643 --> 00:47:01,599
Hello?

685
00:47:01,683 --> 00:47:04,674
- She was being cagey.
- Come off it, she´s a solicitor.

686
00:47:04,762 --> 00:47:07,834
She has a responsibility
to protect her clients´ interests.

687
00:47:07,922 --> 00:47:10,880
- Fancy her, do you?
- I´d show her the error of her ways.

688
00:47:10,962 --> 00:47:14,079
Richard, Burdett House.
You heard anything from the Coucil?

689
00:47:14,162 --> 00:47:16,995
Ten minutes of Mantovani,
then the line went dead.

690
00:47:17,082 --> 00:47:20,358
- Someone must know something.
- If they do, they´re not saying.

691
00:47:20,442 --> 00:47:23,673
H Torres,
a partnership of Panamanian lawyers.

692
00:47:23,762 --> 00:47:27,471
Totally legit and totally uninterested
in answering questions.

693
00:47:27,562 --> 00:47:30,395
- Surprise
- What about this woman at Denis´s?

694
00:47:30,482 --> 00:47:32,359
- Got a description?
- Not much.

695
00:47:32,442 --> 00:47:34,433
I rechecked.
She could´ve had red hair.

696
00:47:34,522 --> 00:47:37,992
Maria Henry has got red hair.
Denis had been phoning her all week.

697
00:47:38,082 --> 00:47:40,836
- We got a printout from BT.
- Now, that´s interesting.

698
00:47:42,163 --> 00:47:44,154
Richard, let´s pay her a social visit.

699
00:47:44,243 --> 00:47:48,282
Anyone been to Burdett House yet?
For God´s sake. Come on, Richard.

700
00:47:49,043 --> 00:47:50,999
Come on!

701
00:47:55,203 --> 00:47:57,797
They all lock the same
and smell the same.

702
00:47:57,883 --> 00:48:00,191
Know what the Russians call them?

703
00:48:00,282 --> 00:48:03,194
- No what?
- Stack a prole

704
00:48:03,282 --> 00:48:07,161
- What´s this one called again?
- Fort Larchmont.

705
00:48:07,242 --> 00:48:11,474
- Also known as the Larchmont Estate.
- Larchmont Estate...

706
00:48:11,562 --> 00:48:15,271
Makes it sound pretty. Like somewhere
you might actually want to live.

707
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:50,833
300 grand for this lot.
Someone´s having us on.

708
00:48:53,401 --> 00:48:56,473
I think it´s time to have a talk
to Mrs Henry.

709
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:00,474
I understand that for legal reasons,
you feel unable

710
00:49:00,561 --> 00:49:04,236
to comment on this case
or grant us access to any of your files.

711
00:49:04,321 --> 00:49:08,155
That´s correct. I honestly feel
I´ve been as frank as I dare be.

712
00:49:11,681 --> 00:49:13,797
You´re divorced, aren´t you, Mrs Henry?

713
00:49:13,881 --> 00:49:18,591
I´m sorry, but what´s my private life
got to do with this investigation?

714
00:49:18,681 --> 00:49:22,561
Well, we´re trying to build a profile
of Denis Carradine and his friends.

715
00:49:24,682 --> 00:49:27,560
Now, when was the last time
you spoke to Mr Carradine?

716
00:49:29,162 --> 00:49:34,031
Well, I don´t really know.
Over a week ago. It was at the club.

717
00:49:34,801 --> 00:49:36,837
Oh...

718
00:49:36,921 --> 00:49:38,751
We have...

719
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,230
We have a record of Denis Carradine´s
phone calls...

720
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:48,393
that show that he called you three times
on the day he was murdered.

721
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,629
Really?

722
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,039
Do they show I actually spoke to him?

723
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,556
I do have a secretary, you know.
I do have an answerphone.

724
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,349
Messages are all logged in the diary.
Please be my guest.

725
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:10,036
This is just a formality
and I´m sorry to have to ask you this,

726
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,999
but could you tell me where you were
on the night that Denis was murdered,

727
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,514
that is, between about 7:00 and 9:00?

728
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,676
Am I a suspect in this case?

729
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,830
No. I don´t think anyone is suggesting that.

730
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:31,233
Good. Having diner
with Paul Endicott and his wife at the club.

731
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:36,030
20 or 30 people can give us an alibi,
if you really think it´s necessary.

732
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,990
You may find it quaint, Superintendent,

733
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,548
but I have a reputation in this town.

734
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,710
And it´s very important to me.

735
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,675
In future, before you doubt my honesty,

736
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,909
please check your facts first

737
00:50:52,879 --> 00:50:55,393
Now, if you´ll excuse me, I am rather busy.

738
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,117
Are we to understand
that the girl you arrested...

739
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:02,751
in conection with this murder
has been released?

740
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,751
Yes, we couldn´t hold her any longer.

741
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,274
She was charged
with breaking-and-entering.

742
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,839
We all know what that means.

743
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,196
I understand your disappointment
but burglary is not murder.

744
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,669
Now, Michael Thomas is already dead.

745
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:19,154
I´m sure you wouldn´t want us to charge
Sheila with something she didn´t do,

746
00:51:19,239 --> 00:51:21,594
upon which we could get no conviction.

747
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:24,671
It´s easy to ridicule
middle-class values.

748
00:51:24,759 --> 00:51:28,991
But we have rights too.
We want to protect what we worked for.

749
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:32,037
Actually, we´ve been
relatively lucky so far.

750
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:35,873
If we´d have had the Ranleigh Housing
Association right on our doorstep,

751
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:37,472
we´d have been in trouble

752
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:40,278
- Housing association?
- There was a dreadful fuss

753
00:51:40,359 --> 00:51:43,635
There´s been an investigation
into the sale of Burdett House.

754
00:51:43,719 --> 00:51:46,677
The Chief Planing Officer,
Paul Endicott, was suspended.

755
00:51:47,439 --> 00:51:49,669
- Investigation?
- A witchhut, more like!

756
00:51:49,759 --> 00:51:54,958
Ask James Greenlees. He´ll tell you.
He´s Chairman of the Housing Committee.

757
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:59,032
He had to head the damn thing.
It was absurd, do you remember?

758
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:24,229
Burdett House. OK, let´s assume
Denis put his 180 grand into buying it.

759
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:28,470
Thanks. It was 300,000.
Where did the other 120 come from?

760
00:52:28,558 --> 00:52:31,436
- He must´ve had a partner.
- Well done, Sherlock.

761
00:52:31,518 --> 00:52:36,956
- Right. Anything else? Anyone?
- Maybe he offered Denis some deal?

762
00:52:37,038 --> 00:52:40,270
- Maria did the conveyancing.
- Run a financial check on her.

763
00:52:40,359 --> 00:52:44,272
I want to see those office files.
Get a court order. See how she reacts.

764
00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:45,394
Tennison.

765
00:52:45,479 --> 00:52:48,755
Greenlees is chairman of the Housing Committee.
He´s Endicott´s boss.

766
00:52:48,839 --> 00:52:51,717
- He´s got to be involved.
- Chris, you´ve no proof of that.

767
00:52:51,799 --> 00:52:55,474
I want Greenlees interviewed,
here at the nick, not all comfy at home.

768
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:57,868
Christ, being a Tory coucillor is not a sin.

769
00:52:57,959 --> 00:53:01,394
- He lied about Denis getting sacked.
- That don´t mean he killed him!

770
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:03,434
Shut up, please!

771
00:53:03,518 --> 00:53:05,748
Sorry, not you. What did you say?

772
00:53:09,598 --> 00:53:11,554
Well, thank you.

773
00:53:13,678 --> 00:53:15,953
Denis Carradine´s car was found torched

774
00:53:16,038 --> 00:53:18,313
outside Maria Henry´s house last night.

775
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:21,193
I want that court order.

776
00:53:24,757 --> 00:53:27,510
So why should someone
steal Denis Carradine´s car,

777
00:53:27,597 --> 00:53:29,553
park it outside your house

778
00:53:31,997 --> 00:53:33,635
...and then set light to it?

779
00:53:33,717 --> 00:53:37,596
For God´s sake, I keep telling you!
I´ve no idea!

780
00:53:37,677 --> 00:53:40,635
It´s probably those yobs
on the estate that you let go.

781
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,231
It was all a coincidence, was it?

782
00:53:43,317 --> 00:53:46,070
You don´t really expect us to believe that,
do you, Mrs Henry?

783
00:53:46,157 --> 00:53:50,116
Quite frankly, I don´t care what
you believe. It happens to be the truth.

784
00:53:52,557 --> 00:53:55,993
Mrs Henry, I´m obliged to inform you
that we´ve applied for a court order

785
00:53:56,077 --> 00:53:59,911
to search your premises, and impound
any documents relevant to this case.

786
00:53:59,997 --> 00:54:03,307
- Thank you.
- This is outrageous!

787
00:54:03,397 --> 00:54:07,754
Some joyrider leaves a car outside my house
and you raid my office?

788
00:54:07,837 --> 00:54:12,069
You leave us no alternative.
I hope it doesn´t damage your reputation.

789
00:54:13,837 --> 00:54:15,907
- Hello.
- Hello.

790
00:54:15,997 --> 00:54:17,953
What´s going on?

791
00:54:19,477 --> 00:54:21,548
Where the hell were you last night?

792
00:54:21,638 --> 00:54:23,993
With friends.
I told you I was staying over...

793
00:54:24,918 --> 00:54:27,637
You liar!
You were at the Larchmont Estate.

794
00:54:27,718 --> 00:54:30,186
If you´re using drugs, I´ll kill you!

795
00:54:32,598 --> 00:54:35,635
Polly... I´m sorry...

796
00:54:36,677 --> 00:54:38,712
Please, darling...

797
00:54:58,316 --> 00:54:59,874
Sit down, please.

798
00:55:15,836 --> 00:55:16,985
Well...

799
00:55:21,036 --> 00:55:26,064
This is absurd! Good God,
can´t we leave the man some dignity?

800
00:55:33,636 --> 00:55:35,627
All right, all right.

801
00:55:40,876 --> 00:55:42,832
Denis was...

802
00:55:43,836 --> 00:55:44,951
...homosexual.

803
00:55:46,916 --> 00:55:50,670
He was seen at certain pubs and clubs.

804
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:55,346
That´s why he needed the money,
to pay for their services.

805
00:55:57,475 --> 00:56:00,512
Now you know why I would have preferred
to keep this private.

806
00:56:00,595 --> 00:56:04,635
Really? And who saw him at these clubs?

807
00:56:04,716 --> 00:56:07,469
The Chief Inspector
would like a word in his office.

808
00:56:09,676 --> 00:56:13,112
Yeah. When we´re finished.

809
00:56:15,596 --> 00:56:18,826
So? Who saw him, Mr Greenlees?

810
00:56:18,915 --> 00:56:20,314
Now, Inspector.

811
00:56:26,155 --> 00:56:28,191
I´ll be back in five minutes.

812
00:56:29,515 --> 00:56:31,904
I expect Mr Greenlees to be here
when I get back.

813
00:56:38,675 --> 00:56:41,109
Eight quid? You gotta be joking!

814
00:56:41,195 --> 00:56:43,834
It´s all I´ve g-got.

815
00:56:43,915 --> 00:56:45,871
Please, Geoff.

816
00:56:46,835 --> 00:56:49,668
Oh, go on, then. Seeing as it´s you.

817
00:56:50,835 --> 00:56:52,632
Santa´s arrived.

818
00:56:57,355 --> 00:57:01,394
Do the honours, then, Hamish.
Chop, chop, couple of Bacardi and Cokes.

819
00:57:01,475 --> 00:57:03,864
- That all right for you, Poll?
- Yeah, great.

820
00:57:08,474 --> 00:57:11,864
Well, come on, then, Hamish.
Chop, chop, on the double.

821
00:57:12,794 --> 00:57:14,785
Polly. S-She´s underage.

822
00:57:16,554 --> 00:57:19,273
You wana get that s-seen to, mate.

823
00:57:19,994 --> 00:57:23,748
Two B-Bacardi and C-Cokes, all right?

824
00:57:23,834 --> 00:57:26,268
N- No, I c-can´t.

825
00:57:29,394 --> 00:57:33,865
Right, well, I´ll s-serve myself, then.

826
00:57:37,874 --> 00:57:39,227
Fast hands, boy.

827
00:57:39,954 --> 00:57:43,584
- Fast hands.
- Put that b-back!

828
00:57:44,755 --> 00:57:46,746
M- Make me.

829
00:57:56,595 --> 00:57:58,550
Hamish, is your father here?

830
00:58:10,794 --> 00:58:12,750
Mum, this is Geoff.

831
00:58:15,754 --> 00:58:19,747
I don´t believe it. I mean,
look at you two, you could be sisters.

832
00:58:19,834 --> 00:58:22,427
- Can I get you a drink, Mrs Henry?
- No thank you

833
00:58:22,513 --> 00:58:23,992
Polly and I are leaving

834
00:58:25,473 --> 00:58:28,590
Surely you could stop for a drink,
Mrs Henry. I´m buying.

835
00:58:28,673 --> 00:58:31,665
Now, Polly. Please, darling, come on.

836
00:58:31,753 --> 00:58:34,950
Mrs Henry,
I have the police on the phone.

837
00:58:35,033 --> 00:58:37,706
Your secretary gave them the number.
It´s urgent.

838
00:58:39,113 --> 00:58:42,901
Right I´d better be going
See you later Mrs Henry

839
00:58:44,953 --> 00:58:48,184
- Polly.
- Wait, I´ll come with you, Geoff.

840
00:58:48,273 --> 00:58:52,312
Polly, wait, please!
Yes, three o´clock. I´ll be there, OK.

841
00:58:52,913 --> 00:58:54,631
Polly! Polly!

842
00:58:58,593 --> 00:59:01,027
So we´re just coming up
behind the stolen car.

843
00:59:06,073 --> 00:59:08,143
And moving alongside.

844
00:59:11,753 --> 00:59:13,709
This is the frame we´ve got.

845
00:59:15,793 --> 00:59:17,909
That´s it after enhacement.

846
00:59:17,993 --> 00:59:21,110
- Do you recognise him, Mrs Henry?
- No.

847
00:59:21,193 --> 00:59:23,150
I´m sure I´ve never seen him before.

848
00:59:24,034 --> 00:59:26,468
No. I´m positive.

849
00:59:28,234 --> 00:59:30,509
Lyne?

850
00:59:30,594 --> 00:59:34,143
- Lyne?
- Hamish cut his hand.

851
00:59:34,234 --> 00:59:37,384
Well, he´s dropped blood
all over the carpet.

852
00:59:37,472 --> 00:59:40,623
- Hamish!
- Paul! He´s hurt his hand.

853
00:59:40,712 --> 00:59:43,272
- Hamish, why aren´t you at work?
- I...

854
00:59:44,272 --> 00:59:47,708
- Oh, for God´s sake.
...w- was.

855
00:59:48,992 --> 00:59:50,948
You weren´t. I was just there.

856
00:59:51,872 --> 00:59:54,944
I thought you weren´t going
to the club, Paul.

857
00:59:55,032 --> 00:59:58,786
I had to talk to Jimmy Greenlees
about that Coucil meeting tonight.

858
01:00:02,032 --> 01:00:03,988
Hamish!

859
01:00:11,752 --> 01:00:13,185
Mr Endicott?

860
01:00:13,272 --> 01:00:15,024
Superintendent Tennison.

861
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:17,387
This is Detective Sergeant Cromwell.

862
01:00:17,472 --> 01:00:19,940
Well, we didn´t see him socially.

863
01:00:20,032 --> 01:00:23,149
We might occasionally bump into him
at the club. That was all.

864
01:00:23,232 --> 01:00:27,589
- So you had no business conection?
- No why?

865
01:00:28,352 --> 01:00:31,230
You were involved in the sale
of Burdett House

866
01:00:31,312 --> 01:00:35,225
Did you know that Denis was involved
in the development company that bought it?

867
01:00:35,312 --> 01:00:37,268
No, I didn´t.

868
01:00:39,432 --> 01:00:41,627
Was the sale of Burdett House your decisión?

869
01:00:41,712 --> 01:00:43,942
Mine?

870
01:00:44,032 --> 01:00:47,627
You obviously have no idea
how local government works, do you?

871
01:00:47,712 --> 01:00:50,351
Perhaps you should go on
a course, Sergeant.

872
01:00:50,432 --> 01:00:53,025
Do you think people have courses
on things like that?

873
01:00:53,111 --> 01:00:57,423
Or would you like me to lecture on one?
I am tremendously available.

874
01:00:58,951 --> 01:01:03,264
No, a vote was taken. A democratic vote
of the whole Planing Committee.

875
01:01:03,352 --> 01:01:05,661
And who decided the selling price?

876
01:01:08,672 --> 01:01:12,142
Look, you and I both know that
this has got bugger all to do with Denis.

877
01:01:12,232 --> 01:01:15,383
This is an abuse of my privacy
and I´m not gona have it.

878
01:01:15,472 --> 01:01:20,181
Mr Carradine´s solicitor puts
the selling price at around £300,000.

879
01:01:20,271 --> 01:01:22,227
For 200 acres of prime land.

880
01:01:23,111 --> 01:01:26,228
Would you not agree that
that´s well below the market price?

881
01:01:27,511 --> 01:01:31,220
There´s a Coucil meeting tonight.
Why don´t you ask them?

882
01:01:31,311 --> 01:01:34,064
Now, if you will excuse me.

883
01:01:34,151 --> 01:01:37,063
Denis Carradine´s solicitor, Maria Henry.

884
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:40,268
She´s... a friend of yours, isn´t she?

885
01:01:41,591 --> 01:01:46,346
My private life is my own affair.
It´s got sod all to do with you lot.

886
01:01:46,431 --> 01:01:49,104
Lyne, these ladies are leaving.

887
01:01:54,631 --> 01:01:58,590
Once again, Mr Chairman,
we discover a favoured developer

888
01:01:58,671 --> 01:02:01,663
bidding less
and still being awarded the contract

889
01:02:02,871 --> 01:02:07,149
And not because of the efficacy
of its proposal, oh, no.

890
01:02:07,231 --> 01:02:11,189
Because it suits the political aspirations
of this Coucil.

891
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:14,342
Point of order! Point of order!

892
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:18,426
Mr Mason, sit down.

893
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:24,506
It is exactly this climate of witchhunt...

894
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:30,347
...and hysteria, whipped up
by the opposition and the press,

895
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:32,546
that has hampered this internal inquiry.

896
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:39,983
And... And caused the delay
in the publication of our findings.

897
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:43,310
Yet again we are faced with the evidence

898
01:02:43,391 --> 01:02:47,907
of the corrupt and secretive way
this Coucil conducts its business.

899
01:02:49,151 --> 01:02:51,301
Withdraw that remark.

900
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:53,302
Why? It´s the truth.

901
01:02:54,951 --> 01:02:57,510
Order! Point of order!

902
01:02:57,590 --> 01:03:00,741
Mr Mason, if you don´t sit down,
I shall have to have you removed.

903
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:05,069
- You should be removed.
- Point of order!

904
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:10,423
Stewards! Clear the chamber.

905
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:14,823
Out, out!

906
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:17,947
This meeting is now formally adjourned.

907
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:20,624
Out, out, out!

908
01:03:29,709 --> 01:03:31,665
Just sit her down, please.

909
01:03:37,229 --> 01:03:40,141
Police officer!
She´s got a warrant, you pillock!

910
01:03:40,229 --> 01:03:44,381
This is typical of your conduct
sice you arrived in this borough.

911
01:03:44,469 --> 01:03:48,223
From your failure to control your officers
to harrying inocent people.

912
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:51,699
I believe your entire agenda
has been politically motivated.

913
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:57,258
Got any comment to make about that,
Superintendent? Superintendent!

914
01:03:59,789 --> 01:04:01,745
You wanted to see me?

915
01:04:03,789 --> 01:04:06,826
What is this all about?
Democracy in action?

916
01:04:09,229 --> 01:04:12,585
- It didn´t happen like that.
- A politically-motivated witchhunt?

917
01:04:12,669 --> 01:04:15,342
- Greenlees wants us off the case.
- He´s not the only one

918
01:04:15,429 --> 01:04:17,659
Cromwell´s suspended, you´re back here, now.

919
01:04:17,749 --> 01:04:19,501
- Raymond´s taking over.
- Look!

920
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:21,864
No, you look!
You´ve got no bloody case.

921
01:04:21,949 --> 01:04:25,625
- Burdett House is a part of...
- Don´t give me that conspiracy crap.

922
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:27,666
I don´t want to hear it.

923
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:33,948
All right.

924
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:36,305
All right. Well, let me put it this way.

925
01:04:37,389 --> 01:04:41,097
Supposing some hairy leflwing journalist
got hold of the story

926
01:04:41,188 --> 01:04:44,464
that the Met did nothing
about a major Coucil fraud...

927
01:04:44,548 --> 01:04:46,504
associated with a murder?

928
01:04:47,948 --> 01:04:50,303
Conspiracy is exactly what they´d call it.

929
01:04:52,068 --> 01:04:54,423
I don´t know, but the press
do have a funy way

930
01:04:54,508 --> 01:04:57,386
of finding out about these things,
don´t they?

931
01:05:01,028 --> 01:05:02,302
Are you threatening me?

932
01:05:05,708 --> 01:05:08,063
I want Cromwell back on the case.

933
01:05:09,068 --> 01:05:11,536
Politics, Mike. It´s what it´s all about.

934
01:05:12,748 --> 01:05:16,377
- Get a result, Jane.
- Of course, sir.

935
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:25,136
Where´ve you been?
You´ve had me worried sick.

936
01:05:25,228 --> 01:05:28,300
- Drink too much, did he?
- Don´t be so bloody facetious.

937
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:33,023
- I asked you a question.
- With Geoff, all right?

938
01:05:33,108 --> 01:05:35,622
I stayed with Geoff.

939
01:05:35,708 --> 01:05:38,063
You´ve got your lover and I´ve got mine.

940
01:05:38,148 --> 01:05:41,060
You stupid little slut.

941
01:05:41,148 --> 01:05:44,857
Yeah, well, at least mine´s
not cheating on his wife.

942
01:05:44,948 --> 01:05:48,020
Polly! Polly, please!

943
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:56,584
- What are we gona do?
- For God´s sake, stop your snivelling!

944
01:06:08,108 --> 01:06:10,064
Christine.

945
01:06:10,948 --> 01:06:13,701
I want to have a few words
about personal security.

946
01:06:14,828 --> 01:06:19,139
Yeah, you may well laugh, lads,
but it´s better safe than sorry.

947
01:06:19,227 --> 01:06:22,185
Look, about this damage-limitation stuff...

948
01:06:22,267 --> 01:06:24,417
Taken to wearing nappies, Josh?

949
01:06:26,547 --> 01:06:28,503
All right, out, the lot of you.

950
01:06:37,147 --> 01:06:38,819
Sparing my feelings?

951
01:06:38,907 --> 01:06:41,865
Greenlees phoned Kernan,
Kernan saw the newspaper.

952
01:06:41,947 --> 01:06:43,903
So I´m off the case?

953
01:06:44,907 --> 01:06:47,630
Look, Chris, Greenlees has set himself up...

954
01:06:47,665 --> 01:06:50,216
as the unofficial
spokesman of this community,

955
01:06:50,227 --> 01:06:54,584
and this community, for reasons best known
to itself, accepts him as such.

956
01:06:56,747 --> 01:07:00,820
Now, we serve this community,
so regardless of our opinion of him,

957
01:07:00,907 --> 01:07:02,704
he is entitled to our courtesy.

958
01:07:02,787 --> 01:07:05,017
Oh, you were there. Bloody hell!

959
01:07:05,107 --> 01:07:07,715
His sort are so good at yelling
for their courtesy,

960
01:07:07,716 --> 01:07:10,058
there´s sod all lefl for anyone else.

961
01:07:11,226 --> 01:07:14,377
- He´s scared you off.
- You were out of line in his office.

962
01:07:14,466 --> 01:07:16,934
- You were out of line last night.
- You finished?

963
01:07:17,026 --> 01:07:18,903
No, I have not, so shut up and sit down!

964
01:07:25,466 --> 01:07:27,934
I put my job on the line for you
this morning.

965
01:07:29,666 --> 01:07:32,817
Don´t know why. You sure as hell
haven´t earned it. So start.

966
01:07:34,266 --> 01:07:37,224
- I´m not suspended?
- It´s on hold.

967
01:07:38,466 --> 01:07:41,776
I want Denis Carradine´s killers.
Chris, I want them all.

968
01:07:41,866 --> 01:07:44,700
I know you can help us get them.

969
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:49,418
Just don´t let your pride blow it
for us, all right?

970
01:07:53,187 --> 01:07:55,303
Right.

971
01:07:55,387 --> 01:07:58,742
Well, where´s Raymond?
He´s not gona be pleased.

972
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:18,657
You bastards...

973
01:08:21,426 --> 01:08:24,497
Police! Open the door!
Right, in you go.

974
01:08:35,345 --> 01:08:38,018
Get off!

975
01:08:46,025 --> 01:08:47,140
Geoff?

976
01:09:05,145 --> 01:09:07,534
That is why they call them the filth!

977
01:09:15,585 --> 01:09:17,576
Right little slag, ain´t you?

978
01:09:19,265 --> 01:09:21,335
Geoff...

979
01:09:21,425 --> 01:09:23,780
All right. How much?

980
01:09:25,986 --> 01:09:28,978
Come on, you don´t think
I´m gona do it for nothing, do you?

981
01:09:33,866 --> 01:09:37,221
Can´t afford it, eh?
You got your mummy´s problem.

982
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:41,582
Two slags in one family.
I should´ve known.

983
01:09:41,664 --> 01:09:43,780
I don´t understand.

984
01:09:45,384 --> 01:09:47,295
Why are you doing this to me?

985
01:09:47,384 --> 01:09:49,340
Aw...

986
01:09:55,984 --> 01:09:58,373
Does little Polly want to know why?

987
01:10:03,544 --> 01:10:07,139
Denis knew about the Coucil fraud.
We knew he was desperate for money.

988
01:10:08,384 --> 01:10:10,693
We´re still no closer to the actual killers.

989
01:10:10,784 --> 01:10:13,457
Maria and Endicott have both got alibis.

990
01:10:13,544 --> 01:10:15,819
They could´ve paid someone.

991
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:19,780
Yeah, why pay someone
to kill the blackmailer?

992
01:10:19,864 --> 01:10:22,583
- Just pay the blackmailer.
- They couldn´t anyway,  Guv.

993
01:10:22,664 --> 01:10:25,224
She´s skint. We´ve checked her accounts.

994
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:28,660
And Endicott is in the middle
of this inquiry. He´d dare not.

995
01:10:28,744 --> 01:10:30,974
Which puts us back to square one.

996
01:10:31,064 --> 01:10:33,624
Pull Maria in, Guv. What we got to lose?

997
01:10:34,664 --> 01:10:38,373
A lot. She´s been to law school.
She´ll run legal rings around us.

998
01:10:39,264 --> 01:10:42,654
Got a female downstairs, name of Henry.
Doesn´t look too good.

999
01:10:46,944 --> 01:10:50,459
- She´s brought herself in.
- Diner on a plate.

1000
01:11:00,583 --> 01:11:03,222
The doctor´s on his way.

1001
01:11:03,303 --> 01:11:05,579
- Who did this to you, Polly?
- A man.

1002
01:11:05,664 --> 01:11:07,256
Geoffrey Brenan.

1003
01:11:07,344 --> 01:11:08,936
I want him arrested.

1004
01:11:09,024 --> 01:11:10,742
- Bastard.
- All right, OK...

1005
01:11:10,824 --> 01:11:13,941
- Does your mother know you´re here?
- What does she care?

1006
01:11:14,024 --> 01:11:16,379
She wanted this to happen.

1007
01:11:16,463 --> 01:11:20,172
- What are you talking about?
- He got thrown out of the army.

1008
01:11:20,263 --> 01:11:22,140
She kept telling me not to go near him,

1009
01:11:22,223 --> 01:11:24,259
acted like she hated him.

1010
01:11:24,343 --> 01:11:28,052
All right, now, look. Just calm down.

1011
01:11:28,903 --> 01:11:30,859
Tell me what happened.

1012
01:11:31,943 --> 01:11:33,899
She saw us at the club yesterday.

1013
01:11:35,543 --> 01:11:38,580
She freaked. I went back with him.

1014
01:11:39,343 --> 01:11:41,493
Stayed the night.

1015
01:11:41,583 --> 01:11:43,858
When she found out, she went mad.

1016
01:11:43,943 --> 01:11:46,059
Completely mad.

1017
01:11:46,143 --> 01:11:48,498
Called me a slut in front of Paul.

1018
01:11:50,743 --> 01:11:52,540
Paul? Who´s Paul?

1019
01:11:52,623 --> 01:11:55,933
Her boyfriend. Paul Endicott.

1020
01:11:56,823 --> 01:11:59,576
It´s all right for her,
she can do whatever she likes,

1021
01:11:59,663 --> 01:12:02,461
but when it´s me,
she starts screaming and shouting.

1022
01:12:02,543 --> 01:12:03,612
Right...

1023
01:12:03,703 --> 01:12:05,455
So you went back to Geoff?

1024
01:12:07,943 --> 01:12:09,898
I thought he wanted me.

1025
01:12:12,422 --> 01:12:14,378
He called me a slag.

1026
01:12:16,422 --> 01:12:18,811
He kept laughing and sneering.

1027
01:12:20,942 --> 01:12:23,695
He said he´d only done it with me
to get at my mother.

1028
01:12:23,782 --> 01:12:25,773
I wanted to kill him.

1029
01:12:25,862 --> 01:12:27,818
And where did this happen?

1030
01:12:29,462 --> 01:12:32,056
A flat on the Larchmont Estate.

1031
01:12:32,142 --> 01:12:34,656
Dragonda House.

1032
01:12:34,742 --> 01:12:38,178
Polly, can you describe Geoff for me?

1033
01:12:43,822 --> 01:12:46,581
- Got him! Josh, get Maria Henry in.
- What on?

1034
01:12:46,663 --> 01:12:50,078
Nothing. Tell her her daughter´s
been beaten up but keep them apart.

1035
01:12:50,163 --> 01:12:53,057
Lan, you entertain her.
Rest of you come with me.

1036
01:12:53,143 --> 01:12:54,098
Where?

1037
01:12:54,183 --> 01:12:57,652
To arrest Geoffrey Brenan
for the murder of Denis Carradine.

1038
01:12:57,742 --> 01:13:01,212
- Who the hell´s Geoffrey Brenan?
- Bound to be a Tory coucillor!

1039
01:13:13,622 --> 01:13:15,578
Hey, Derek!

1040
01:13:18,942 --> 01:13:22,821
- What´s going on?
- DCI Raymond nicked Sheila Bower.

1041
01:13:22,902 --> 01:13:25,415
- It´s not a great idea.
- Who sanctioned this?

1042
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:30,017
Your chief superintendent felt the squatter
and drug problem was getting out-of-hand.

1043
01:13:30,821 --> 01:13:32,049
Oi!

1044
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:35,099
- Excuse me.
- It´s all a bloody game, isn´t it?

1045
01:13:43,861 --> 01:13:45,817
Guv.

1046
01:13:52,581 --> 01:13:55,254
Mr Brenan! Police.

1047
01:14:03,141 --> 01:14:05,097
Police!

1048
01:14:09,301 --> 01:14:11,257
Anyone?

1049
01:14:15,941 --> 01:14:17,897
Guv.

1050
01:14:35,582 --> 01:14:38,937
It´ll be half an hour soon.
Where the hell is he?

1051
01:14:39,021 --> 01:14:40,738
Oh, it´s all right. Here he is.

1052
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:43,380
Two in a week.
Still, think of the overtime, eh?

1053
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:46,370
Ma´am, looks like
we may have a witness.

1054
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:53,009
Then there was this couple
in this green Jeep-type thing.

1055
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,409
Parked up in the middle of
all the aggravation.

1056
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:58,856
I thought to myself, ´´You leave it there,
you´re asking for trouble. ´´

1057
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:02,979
- Then this bloke gets out.
- This Jeep, was it a Range Rover?

1058
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:05,813
Oh, I don´t know.

1059
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:09,575
And when I came back up again,
he was banging on matey boy´s door.

1060
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:11,776
George, would you recognise this man again?

1061
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:14,055
Well, I was keeping my head down.

1062
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:20,130
- He was tall... Yeah, maybe.
- What about the other person?

1063
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:22,688
No, I only saw her for a second.

1064
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:26,050
- Lovely red hair though
- Long?

1065
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:28,051
No! Only to about here.

1066
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:40,013
If I´ve been dragged down here
under false pretences,

1067
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,216
I shall be making a complaint.

1068
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:43,858
That is your prerogative.

1069
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:51,737
Burdett House. We know Denis Carradine
bought it from the Coucil.

1070
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:55,538
It cost somewhere in the region of £300,000.

1071
01:15:56,259 --> 01:15:58,819
Cheap for such a large property,
wouldn´t you say?

1072
01:15:58,899 --> 01:16:02,175
I wouldn´t really know.
We were only involved in the conveyancing.

1073
01:16:02,259 --> 01:16:06,047
- It was a crumbling heap.
- With planing permissión for luxury homes.

1074
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:09,774
Inside information that you knew.

1075
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:11,976
Paul Endicott told you.

1076
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:15,291
The Coucil had to sell Burdett House
as quickly as possible,

1077
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:18,212
to stop a housing cooperative
from buying it.

1078
01:16:18,299 --> 01:16:20,255
Not the right kind of people.

1079
01:16:21,339 --> 01:16:24,172
The buyers stood to make a fortue.
You and Denis.

1080
01:16:24,939 --> 01:16:27,533
Were you his silent partner, Maria?

1081
01:16:27,619 --> 01:16:31,373
No! That would be both
illegal and unethical!

1082
01:16:31,459 --> 01:16:34,849
Yes, exactly what the Coucil´s
gerrymandering policy was.

1083
01:16:35,779 --> 01:16:39,738
When it blew up in their faces
and they withheld planing permissión,

1084
01:16:39,819 --> 01:16:42,970
you and Denis were left
holding a property worth nothing

1085
01:16:43,819 --> 01:16:46,891
That is pure speculation and you know it.

1086
01:16:48,299 --> 01:16:49,937
Um...

1087
01:16:50,019 --> 01:16:53,568
How would you define your relationship
with Paul Endicott?

1088
01:16:54,579 --> 01:16:57,969
He´s a friend.
Our families meet socially.

1089
01:16:58,779 --> 01:17:02,977
So any suggestion that you are
involved in a sexual relationship...

1090
01:17:03,979 --> 01:17:06,174
would be quite utrue?

1091
01:17:06,259 --> 01:17:09,569
His wife is a friend of mine,
Superintendent.

1092
01:17:11,538 --> 01:17:13,369
I see.

1093
01:17:13,458 --> 01:17:15,369
And when did you last see Mr Endicott?

1094
01:17:16,418 --> 01:17:20,616
- I don´t know. A few days ago.
- Didn´t you see him this morning?

1095
01:17:21,418 --> 01:17:23,932
Absolutely not! Who told you that?

1096
01:17:24,018 --> 01:17:26,452
Your daughter Polly

1097
01:17:26,538 --> 01:17:28,449
You see, she seems to think

1098
01:17:28,538 --> 01:17:31,257
the two of you having been
having an affair for months.

1099
01:17:37,698 --> 01:17:39,017
Mrs Henry?

1100
01:17:41,618 --> 01:17:47,615
Have you interviewed her?
Polly is 15, Superintendent. She´s a minor.

1101
01:17:47,699 --> 01:17:51,408
It is unlawful to interview a minor
without a parent or guardian present.

1102
01:17:51,499 --> 01:17:55,458
- You are aware of that?
- Polly came to us with a complaint.

1103
01:17:55,539 --> 01:17:57,893
We investigated. She wasn´t interviewed.

1104
01:17:57,978 --> 01:18:00,446
I hope not. For your sake.

1105
01:18:01,858 --> 01:18:06,010
- And Mr Endicott?
- Is a friend. That´s all.

1106
01:18:08,258 --> 01:18:09,896
I see.

1107
01:18:13,058 --> 01:18:15,856
We´ve compiled an ID of a man seen earlier

1108
01:18:15,938 --> 01:18:19,613
at Denis Carradine´s house
on the night of the murder.

1109
01:18:19,698 --> 01:18:23,896
The description matches a man
called Geoffrey Brenan. Do you know him?

1110
01:18:23,978 --> 01:18:25,172
No.

1111
01:18:28,897 --> 01:18:30,853
This is Geoffrey Brenan.

1112
01:18:33,857 --> 01:18:37,816
This is the man who stole Denis´s car
and set fire to it outside your house.

1113
01:18:37,897 --> 01:18:40,172
The man we showed you
on the video.

1114
01:18:42,177 --> 01:18:45,214
Do you still maintain
you do not recognise him?

1115
01:18:45,297 --> 01:18:47,527
Yes, I´ve already told you.

1116
01:18:50,377 --> 01:18:53,210
Did you know your daughter
was sleeping with him?

1117
01:18:53,297 --> 01:18:56,892
What are you talking about? She´s 15!

1118
01:18:56,977 --> 01:18:59,127
She says you met them together yesterday.

1119
01:18:59,217 --> 01:19:01,287
Yesterday?

1120
01:19:01,377 --> 01:19:03,333
Yes, at the Huntington Club.

1121
01:19:05,017 --> 01:19:08,692
Yes, I met someone there,
but he didn´t look like that.

1122
01:19:09,577 --> 01:19:12,330
You´re going to have to do
better than that, Maria.

1123
01:19:14,377 --> 01:19:16,447
The only way you could have obtained

1124
01:19:16,537 --> 01:19:20,530
this so-called information,
Superintendent, is illegally.

1125
01:19:21,337 --> 01:19:23,612
If so, you´ll be in a great deal of trouble.

1126
01:19:23,697 --> 01:19:26,655
Your daughter came here
with her face in a mess

1127
01:19:26,737 --> 01:19:28,649
and accused Brenan of attacking her.

1128
01:19:28,738 --> 01:19:30,729
We went to arrest him and found him dead.

1129
01:19:32,978 --> 01:19:36,208
- It´s as simple as that.
- I don´t believe that.

1130
01:19:37,937 --> 01:19:40,610
You believe what you like.

1131
01:19:40,697 --> 01:19:43,574
You see, we have a description
of a man and a woman,

1132
01:19:43,656 --> 01:19:47,649
seen at the time of Brenan´s murder,
that matches you and Paul Endicott.

1133
01:19:53,976 --> 01:19:57,571
I think that you and your lover
conspired to murder Denis Carradine

1134
01:19:57,656 --> 01:20:00,375
and employed Geoffrey Brenan
to do it.

1135
01:20:00,456 --> 01:20:03,289
And subsequently, when he threatened you...

1136
01:20:04,416 --> 01:20:06,976
...the pair of you got rid of him.

1137
01:20:07,056 --> 01:20:10,492
If you really believed that,
you´d charge me.

1138
01:20:25,056 --> 01:20:27,809
Right, so she´s not going
to stick her hand up.

1139
01:20:27,896 --> 01:20:29,932
Maybe there´s something in her office.

1140
01:20:30,016 --> 01:20:32,974
No way, she´s too sure of herself.
Covered her tracks.

1141
01:20:33,056 --> 01:20:36,128
- God, what a bitch.
- So what now?

1142
01:20:36,216 --> 01:20:38,446
Richard, any news from Brenan´s flat?

1143
01:20:38,536 --> 01:20:40,731
Looks like he was attacked with a hammer.

1144
01:20:40,816 --> 01:20:42,454
We should get something off it.

1145
01:20:42,536 --> 01:20:45,255
Forensic reckon he was given
a right whacking.

1146
01:20:45,336 --> 01:20:48,055
Let´s get Maria printed. Get a court order.

1147
01:20:48,136 --> 01:20:50,775
- Where´s Endicott?
- Interview room, Guv.

1148
01:20:50,856 --> 01:20:54,371
- He´s got a solicitor with him.
- Right, let´s have a crack at him.

1149
01:20:55,096 --> 01:20:57,051
Good luck, Guv.

1150
01:21:09,536 --> 01:21:11,821
Geoffrey Brenan was found
murdered at his flat...

1151
01:21:11,822 --> 01:21:14,512
on the Larchmont Estate at 1:15 today.

1152
01:21:17,015 --> 01:21:18,971
God...

1153
01:21:23,615 --> 01:21:25,253
Well, it wasn´t me.

1154
01:21:27,255 --> 01:21:30,133
Maria Henry and you are good friends,
aren´t you?

1155
01:21:31,095 --> 01:21:33,484
Er... Yes, yes, we are.

1156
01:21:33,575 --> 01:21:35,486
Very... good friends.

1157
01:21:38,015 --> 01:21:40,483
- She is a family friend.
- That you sleep with.

1158
01:21:42,855 --> 01:21:46,484
Were the two of you involved in
the fraudulent purchase of Burdett House?

1159
01:21:46,575 --> 01:21:48,008
No, that´s not true.

1160
01:21:48,095 --> 01:21:51,565
Wasn´t it you who recommended the sale
to the Planing Committee?

1161
01:21:51,655 --> 01:21:55,933
- I told you, it was a vote.
- The whole scam was your idea.

1162
01:21:57,455 --> 01:21:59,173
We know there is a conection

1163
01:21:59,255 --> 01:22:03,726
between the sale of Burdett House
and Geoffrey Brenan´s murder.

1164
01:22:03,815 --> 01:22:06,454
Well, it wasn´t me. I didn´t... kill him.

1165
01:22:06,535 --> 01:22:10,244
We have a witness who saw a tall man
and a red-haired woman

1166
01:22:10,335 --> 01:22:14,122
in a green four-wheel-drive
at the time of the murder.

1167
01:22:14,214 --> 01:22:18,048
- My client is under no obligation...
- Your friend Maria has red hair.

1168
01:22:18,134 --> 01:22:20,090
You drive a green Monterey.

1169
01:22:21,374 --> 01:22:24,093
- Look, I wasn´t there!
- Where were you at 12:00?

1170
01:22:26,654 --> 01:22:28,485
I went out for a walk.

1171
01:22:29,294 --> 01:22:31,091
Where? Did anyone see you?

1172
01:22:31,174 --> 01:22:33,130
Um... No.

1173
01:22:34,574 --> 01:22:37,964
My client is under no obligation
to answer these questions.

1174
01:22:38,054 --> 01:22:41,364
That´s right. That´s a very good idea.
Say nothing, Paul.

1175
01:22:42,454 --> 01:22:45,969
Because I think you and Maria paid
Brenan to murder Denis Carradine.

1176
01:22:46,054 --> 01:22:48,807
And whateveryou say
that´s what I´ll charge you with

1177
01:22:49,775 --> 01:22:51,652
We´d better get his prints done.

1178
01:22:51,735 --> 01:22:53,327
- Um!
- I´ll get a court order

1179
01:22:58,294 --> 01:22:59,807
Um...

1180
01:22:59,894 --> 01:23:01,327
Look...

1181
01:23:04,734 --> 01:23:09,444
I didn´t even know this Geoffrey Brenan
even existed until today.

1182
01:23:10,734 --> 01:23:12,690
That´s the truth. Um...

1183
01:23:14,894 --> 01:23:17,203
Maria was frightened.

1184
01:23:17,294 --> 01:23:20,843
She said someone was threatening her
and she asked me to stay over.

1185
01:23:22,214 --> 01:23:23,772
Anyway

1186
01:23:25,454 --> 01:23:27,445
...that was when she told me.

1187
01:23:29,813 --> 01:23:32,008
Maria... That she said she´d done it.

1188
01:23:32,093 --> 01:23:34,049
Done what?

1189
01:23:34,853 --> 01:23:37,845
That she´d hired Brenan to kill Denis.

1190
01:23:38,933 --> 01:23:39,968
Why?

1191
01:23:42,213 --> 01:23:45,649
Because he was going to expose
the Burdett House deal.

1192
01:23:45,733 --> 01:23:49,328
He wanted her to bail him out,
but she didn´t have the money.

1193
01:23:50,893 --> 01:23:54,249
If she didn´t have it,
where did she find the cash to hire Brenan?

1194
01:23:54,333 --> 01:23:55,925
- You?
- No! No!

1195
01:23:56,013 --> 01:24:00,689
I knew nothing about it!
Maria said she was going to pay Brenan.

1196
01:24:00,773 --> 01:24:04,163
She promised him £2,000,
was going to give him half of it up front.

1197
01:24:04,253 --> 01:24:06,721
She did that, but she didn´t have the rest.

1198
01:24:06,813 --> 01:24:11,728
He... Well, he threatened her.
He wouldn´t wait. He was furious.

1199
01:24:12,893 --> 01:24:15,930
Brenan, he was just
completely out of control and um...

1200
01:24:16,653 --> 01:24:20,362
She said that I should pay him off or...

1201
01:24:22,493 --> 01:24:24,484
Or we´d have to get rid of him too.

1202
01:24:24,573 --> 01:24:26,131
Is that what you did?

1203
01:24:29,013 --> 01:24:29,969
No...

1204
01:24:30,894 --> 01:24:32,850
All right.

1205
01:24:33,494 --> 01:24:36,690
Paul, if it wasn´t you driving your car
with Maria Henry...

1206
01:24:37,853 --> 01:24:40,208
...who do you think it was?

1207
01:24:40,293 --> 01:24:43,284
I don´t know. I really don´t.

1208
01:24:45,692 --> 01:24:47,683
Look... The...

1209
01:24:47,772 --> 01:24:50,605
The Coucil inquiry is going to exonerate me.

1210
01:24:50,692 --> 01:24:52,808
So why would I risk all that?

1211
01:24:57,732 --> 01:24:59,723
I think we´d better take a statement.

1212
01:25:01,572 --> 01:25:04,723
You´ve got to hand it to her.
We had the kids marked down for that.

1213
01:25:04,812 --> 01:25:07,167
- You did.
- Is there enough to make it stick?

1214
01:25:07,252 --> 01:25:10,608
- Forensic will sort it out.
- If he ever gets his act together.

1215
01:25:12,412 --> 01:25:16,121
Greenlees is gona exonerate him?
Guv, he´s got to be involved.

1216
01:25:16,212 --> 01:25:20,091
Chris, I know he´s an arrogant shit.
That doesn´t make him an accessory.

1217
01:25:20,172 --> 01:25:23,403
Forget him. We haven´t got
enough to prosecute these two yet.

1218
01:25:23,492 --> 01:25:25,722
- About time!
- Right.

1219
01:25:25,812 --> 01:25:28,280
- The good news or the bad news?
- The good news.

1220
01:25:28,372 --> 01:25:31,648
That hammer we found,
the pathologist thinks it´s a reasonable bet.

1221
01:25:31,732 --> 01:25:34,451
The blood grouping looks good
and it´s covered in prints.

1222
01:25:34,532 --> 01:25:35,726
Yes!

1223
01:25:35,812 --> 01:25:39,009
The bad news is
none of them match Paul Endicott´s.

1224
01:25:42,652 --> 01:25:45,485
- Well... What about Maria Henry?
- Sorry.

1225
01:25:45,572 --> 01:25:49,531
So far, there´s no forensic evidence
to put either of them near that flat.

1226
01:25:55,972 --> 01:25:57,325
Not finished yet.

1227
01:26:11,372 --> 01:26:13,442
This is Detective Sergeant Cromwell.

1228
01:26:13,532 --> 01:26:16,091
A continuation of the interview
with Maria Henry.

1229
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:20,926
The time is 18:32.
Entering the room, Superintendent Tennison.

1230
01:26:21,011 --> 01:26:23,650
Well, it´s not gona work, Maria.

1231
01:26:23,731 --> 01:26:25,642
Paul Endicott has made a statement.

1232
01:26:25,731 --> 01:26:28,291
He says the murders are all down to you.

1233
01:26:29,131 --> 01:26:31,326
- Rubbish.
- He´s signed it.

1234
01:26:37,931 --> 01:26:41,207
´´Brenan strung Denis up
and then pulled down his trousers

1235
01:26:41,291 --> 01:26:43,930
and his underpants to make it
look like some kind a sex game. ´´

1236
01:26:45,851 --> 01:26:48,365
He was your oldest friend.
Was that your idea?

1237
01:26:49,851 --> 01:26:52,445
You even went to see him earlier that day.

1238
01:26:53,531 --> 01:26:55,965
We´ve got an ID, Maria.
Why did you do that?

1239
01:26:57,411 --> 01:27:01,848
The right to remain silent seems to be
a concept you don´t fully understand.

1240
01:27:01,931 --> 01:27:04,286
Why remain silent
if you have nothing to hide?

1241
01:27:04,371 --> 01:27:05,770
Why lie?

1242
01:27:13,131 --> 01:27:14,927
All right.

1243
01:27:15,010 --> 01:27:16,966
I admit I visited Denis.

1244
01:27:19,410 --> 01:27:22,720
Look, let´s try and clear this up
once and for all.

1245
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:29,488
Denis had been caught embezzling money
from the Huntington Club.

1246
01:27:29,570 --> 01:27:31,640
Well. That´s why all the phone calls.

1247
01:27:33,610 --> 01:27:35,840
I didn´t tell you because...

1248
01:27:36,610 --> 01:27:40,046
Well, quite frankly, I was embarrassed.

1249
01:27:40,930 --> 01:27:42,648
I mean, I´ve got friends at the club

1250
01:27:42,730 --> 01:27:47,520
and I didn´t want the police
crawling all over my private affairs.

1251
01:27:47,610 --> 01:27:50,523
I offered to lend him some money.

1252
01:27:50,611 --> 01:27:53,728
Oh, and did Denis accept
your kind offer of help?

1253
01:27:53,811 --> 01:27:56,927
Of course he didn´t,
because you didn´t make one, did you?

1254
01:27:57,010 --> 01:28:00,559
You can´t, Maria. You´re broke.
We know, we´ve checked.

1255
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:03,084
Your money is tied up
in the Burdett House scam.

1256
01:28:03,170 --> 01:28:05,400
You couldn´t even afford to pay Brenan.

1257
01:28:05,490 --> 01:28:09,119
That´s completely untrue.
I know nothing about that.

1258
01:28:09,210 --> 01:28:11,485
It´s all down here in black and white.

1259
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:14,960
Paul Endicott is a drunk and a liar.

1260
01:28:15,050 --> 01:28:17,928
He´s also totally corrupt
and I can prove it.

1261
01:28:18,010 --> 01:28:21,259
He was the one that approached Denis about
Burdett House. I had nothing to do with it!

1262
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:27,043
In Fact, if you check my files, I actually
advised Denis against the purchase.

1263
01:28:29,769 --> 01:28:33,523
Endicott´s been taking kickbacks for years.

1264
01:28:33,609 --> 01:28:38,729
I absolutely deny everything he says
and you can´t prove otherwise.

1265
01:28:38,809 --> 01:28:41,528
Now, I´d like to see my daughter, please.

1266
01:28:49,609 --> 01:28:51,361
It´s all circumstantial.

1267
01:28:51,449 --> 01:28:53,485
And Polly? We have to let her see her.

1268
01:28:53,569 --> 01:28:56,879
- Not yet. Not yet.
- Oh, Superintendent.

1269
01:28:56,969 --> 01:29:00,803
Paul Endicott´s wife phoned me.
She was very upset.

1270
01:29:00,889 --> 01:29:04,086
- She told me he´d been arrested.
- Yes, yes, that´s correct.

1271
01:29:04,169 --> 01:29:06,364
There was a murder on the Larchmont...

1272
01:29:06,449 --> 01:29:08,405
So I understand.

1273
01:29:09,209 --> 01:29:11,962
You´ve got the wrong man, Superintendent.

1274
01:29:12,049 --> 01:29:16,440
I can assure you, Paul wouldn´t be seen dead
on the Larchmont Estate.

1275
01:29:16,529 --> 01:29:18,485
Thank you, we´ll bear that in mind.

1276
01:29:18,569 --> 01:29:24,041
I take it this is just an informal interview,
then, and you´ll be releasing him shortly?

1277
01:29:24,129 --> 01:29:25,881
Mr Greenlees, someone is dead.

1278
01:29:25,969 --> 01:29:28,437
He may not have been part
of your iner circle of friends,

1279
01:29:28,529 --> 01:29:31,124
but he still had rights
and someone caved his head in.

1280
01:29:31,210 --> 01:29:35,122
I´m in charge of this case and I will decide
who gets released and when! All right?

1281
01:29:38,809 --> 01:29:40,765
I knew you´d blow it.

1282
01:29:41,889 --> 01:29:45,119
Yeah... He hums it, you sing it.

1283
01:29:46,048 --> 01:29:48,482
- Dick.
- Guv!

1284
01:29:48,568 --> 01:29:50,365
Hamish Endicott.

1285
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:02,561
I found him down by the canal
behind the estate.

1286
01:30:02,648 --> 01:30:05,082
When I walked up to him,
he turns around and says,

1287
01:30:05,168 --> 01:30:07,841
´´I´ve killed someone.
You better lock me up. ´´

1288
01:30:09,528 --> 01:30:11,758
Why did you want to kill him, Hamish?

1289
01:30:11,848 --> 01:30:15,443
He´s a b-b-b-b...

1290
01:30:15,528 --> 01:30:17,280
He´s a bastard!

1291
01:30:17,368 --> 01:30:23,284
He d-didn´t deserve to live
after what he d-did.

1292
01:30:24,328 --> 01:30:27,161
- What did he do?
- You know, to P-P...

1293
01:30:29,728 --> 01:30:31,684
...Polly.

1294
01:30:33,208 --> 01:30:35,961
- What did he do to Polly?
- He

1295
01:30:38,928 --> 01:30:41,567
...r- raped her.

1296
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:45,762
And I´d do it again.

1297
01:30:48,368 --> 01:30:53,317
Who told you that, Hamish?
Who told you that Brenan raped Polly?

1298
01:30:53,408 --> 01:30:55,364
Was it Maria?

1299
01:30:56,568 --> 01:30:58,320
No.

1300
01:30:58,408 --> 01:31:01,285
- She told me.
- Cos that wasn´t true.

1301
01:31:01,367 --> 01:31:03,483
S- Sh...

1302
01:31:03,567 --> 01:31:05,444
- She told me.
- Hamish, she was lying.

1303
01:31:05,527 --> 01:31:07,563
N- n...

1304
01:31:07,647 --> 01:31:12,005
N... I´m n-not saying any m-more.

1305
01:31:12,088 --> 01:31:16,080
Hamish, who was it in that car with you?
The red-haired woman.

1306
01:31:16,167 --> 01:31:18,123
Who was that? Was that Polly?

1307
01:31:19,047 --> 01:31:21,356
- No!
- Was it Maria?

1308
01:31:23,407 --> 01:31:26,444
I told you, it was m-me!

1309
01:31:26,527 --> 01:31:30,236
I did it! On my own! Me!

1310
01:31:30,327 --> 01:31:32,522
- All right...
- It was me!

1311
01:31:32,607 --> 01:31:35,485
- Yeah, all right. All right!
- It was me!

1312
01:31:35,567 --> 01:31:38,081
- I did it.
- Superintendent Tennison, 7:22.

1313
01:31:38,167 --> 01:31:40,123
I´m suspending this interview.

1314
01:31:40,207 --> 01:31:42,323
Hamish, look, I´m turning the tape off.

1315
01:31:46,847 --> 01:31:48,803
Get him a tea.
Hot tea with lots of sugar.

1316
01:31:57,327 --> 01:31:59,477
Hamish.

1317
01:31:59,567 --> 01:32:01,797
Come and sit down. Come on.

1318
01:32:01,887 --> 01:32:03,605
Come on.

1319
01:32:03,687 --> 01:32:05,643
Come on, it´s all right.

1320
01:32:08,247 --> 01:32:10,203
Come on.

1321
01:32:20,366 --> 01:32:24,120
Look. Denis was a friend of yours,
wasn´t he?

1322
01:32:25,286 --> 01:32:27,402
Yeah.

1323
01:32:27,486 --> 01:32:30,717
- He was all right.
- Hmm.

1324
01:32:32,886 --> 01:32:35,525
He was a friend of Maria´s too.

1325
01:32:35,606 --> 01:32:37,597
Until she had him killed.

1326
01:32:42,166 --> 01:32:44,122
No.

1327
01:32:44,966 --> 01:32:46,922
She couldn´t.

1328
01:32:47,926 --> 01:32:52,557
Listen, you know that Maria and your father
were lovers, don´t you?

1329
01:32:56,606 --> 01:32:59,404
Well, she and your father
were involved in a fraud.

1330
01:33:00,366 --> 01:33:03,358
And Denis was the front man.
We´ve got your father here.

1331
01:33:03,886 --> 01:33:06,354
Hamish, he´s...

1332
01:33:06,446 --> 01:33:08,402
helping us with our enquiries.

1333
01:33:11,446 --> 01:33:13,402
I don´t...

1334
01:33:16,886 --> 01:33:18,558
...b- believe you.

1335
01:33:18,646 --> 01:33:20,602
It´s the truth.

1336
01:33:21,686 --> 01:33:24,803
Maria had Denis killed
to stop him from talking.

1337
01:33:34,685 --> 01:33:36,641
Here.

1338
01:33:41,925 --> 01:33:44,883
You see, she paid Brenan to kill him.

1339
01:33:46,365 --> 01:33:48,595
And then she got you get rid of him.

1340
01:33:50,885 --> 01:33:53,558
Oh, she used you, my love.

1341
01:33:54,125 --> 01:33:58,915
She used you, just like she used Denis,
like she used your father.

1342
01:33:59,005 --> 01:34:01,917
For Christ´s sake,
why are you trying to protect her?

1343
01:34:08,285 --> 01:34:10,276
But she...

1344
01:34:10,365 --> 01:34:13,437
All right! All right, play the martyr.

1345
01:34:14,725 --> 01:34:17,319
Let me tell you,
if you don´t start talking soon,

1346
01:34:17,405 --> 01:34:20,875
Polly is gona go down
as an accessory to murder.

1347
01:34:20,965 --> 01:34:25,436
And do you know what that means, Hamish?
That means, Polly is gona go to prison.

1348
01:34:25,525 --> 01:34:27,402
- Prison.
- It wasn´t her, all right?

1349
01:34:27,485 --> 01:34:29,362
Well, who was it?

1350
01:34:36,805 --> 01:34:38,557
I want to see my daughter.

1351
01:34:38,645 --> 01:34:40,920
I keep telling you, that is not possible.

1352
01:34:41,005 --> 01:34:43,235
Where were you this afternoon?

1353
01:34:44,805 --> 01:34:48,638
Superintendent Tennison
entering the room at 7:42pm.

1354
01:34:48,724 --> 01:34:52,273
At 1:00 today, you were with Hamish Endicott
on the Larchmont Estate.

1355
01:34:52,364 --> 01:34:53,956
I was not!

1356
01:34:54,044 --> 01:34:56,080
You lied about your daughter being raped...

1357
01:34:56,164 --> 01:34:59,600
and then you sent that boy out
to do your dirty work for you.

1358
01:34:59,684 --> 01:35:02,152
He bungled it, Maria. He dropped the hammer.

1359
01:35:02,244 --> 01:35:04,041
Then he got himself arrested.

1360
01:35:04,124 --> 01:35:06,035
He´s here. He´s told us everything.

1361
01:35:06,124 --> 01:35:10,322
Are you saying Hamish murdered
Geoffrey Brenan?

1362
01:35:10,404 --> 01:35:13,794
Well, as if you didn´t know!
Because you were with him.

1363
01:35:13,884 --> 01:35:18,514
You were seen. We have a witness
who saw a red-haired woman with him.

1364
01:35:18,604 --> 01:35:22,279
Did he say it was me?
Did Hamish say it was me?

1365
01:35:24,684 --> 01:35:27,152
- Exactly.
- Who else could it have been?

1366
01:35:27,244 --> 01:35:31,203
I haven´t the faintest idea. It could
just as easily have been my daughter.

1367
01:35:31,284 --> 01:35:33,593
Oh, God, you´d do anything, wouldn´t you?

1368
01:35:34,604 --> 01:35:37,596
I haven´t done anything, Sergeant.

1369
01:35:37,684 --> 01:35:41,962
You´ve manufactureda lot of hearsay evidence
that you know won´t hold up in court

1370
01:35:42,044 --> 01:35:44,000
and you´re panicking.

1371
01:36:01,923 --> 01:36:03,402
Polly!

1372
01:36:10,363 --> 01:36:12,319
Can you come with us, please?

1373
01:36:14,324 --> 01:36:16,518
You too. Come on.

1374
01:36:35,523 --> 01:36:37,991
Geoffrey Brenan is dead Polly

1375
01:36:38,803 --> 01:36:40,759
What?

1376
01:36:42,923 --> 01:36:44,515
No.

1377
01:36:45,203 --> 01:36:47,956
No, he can´t be!

1378
01:36:48,883 --> 01:36:50,839
He was murdered.

1379
01:36:53,283 --> 01:36:55,797
Hamish Endicott killed him.
We know that.

1380
01:36:58,483 --> 01:37:01,634
We also know that there was
a red-haired female with him.

1381
01:37:02,443 --> 01:37:06,038
It wasn´t me! I didn´t do it! I didn´t!

1382
01:37:06,123 --> 01:37:09,593
Darling, they´re just trying
to frighten you. Now, say nothing.

1383
01:37:09,683 --> 01:37:11,913
We want you to answer some questions.

1384
01:37:12,003 --> 01:37:14,119
- Mummy! Help me!
- It´s all right!

1385
01:37:14,203 --> 01:37:17,000
Mummy won´t let them hurt you, darling.

1386
01:37:17,082 --> 01:37:19,915
She´s underage.
You can´t touch her and you know it.

1387
01:37:20,602 --> 01:37:23,070
But I didn´t do it! I didn´t do it!

1388
01:37:23,162 --> 01:37:26,438
Polly! Where were you at 1:00 today, Polly?

1389
01:37:27,322 --> 01:37:30,314
- I don´t know.
- For God´s sake, stop this!

1390
01:37:30,402 --> 01:37:32,836
- Why aren´t you stopping this?
- Where were you?

1391
01:37:32,922 --> 01:37:34,878
Why are you doing this to me?

1392
01:37:34,962 --> 01:37:39,717
You´re under 16, Polly.
They can´t touch you. Say nothing.

1393
01:37:39,802 --> 01:37:42,600
Did you tell Hamish that you´d been raped?

1394
01:37:43,442 --> 01:37:45,160
What?

1395
01:37:45,242 --> 01:37:48,837
Well, who told Hamish
that Geoff had raped you?

1396
01:37:51,642 --> 01:37:53,474
Who knew how much he loved you?

1397
01:37:54,043 --> 01:37:58,399
Who went cut there with him in
his father´s car, this red-haired woman?

1398
01:37:58,482 --> 01:38:01,952
Who gave him a hammer
and who told him to bash Geoff´s head in?

1399
01:38:02,042 --> 01:38:06,194
- It wasn´t me!
- For God´s sake, she´s just a child.

1400
01:38:06,282 --> 01:38:08,671
Mummy, I didn´t do it!

1401
01:38:08,762 --> 01:38:13,472
What sort of a person would lie like that
and let Hamish take the blame?

1402
01:38:13,562 --> 01:38:15,553
Stop this. Leave her alone!

1403
01:38:15,642 --> 01:38:18,281
You know Hamish
is going to go to prison, don´t you?

1404
01:38:18,362 --> 01:38:20,353
You´re going with him.
Do you know why?

1405
01:38:21,002 --> 01:38:24,233
Because the woman who was with him
is going to let you.

1406
01:38:25,682 --> 01:38:27,593
That´s a lie!

1407
01:38:28,242 --> 01:38:30,802
I never said it was her and you know it

1408
01:38:35,241 --> 01:38:39,280
Oh, no... No, they´re lying.

1409
01:38:39,361 --> 01:38:43,593
Darling, I love you.
I wouldn´t let anything happen to you.

1410
01:38:43,681 --> 01:38:47,469
Someone must have made Hamish kill Geoff,
Polly.

1411
01:38:47,561 --> 01:38:50,200
Oh, Polly, please!

1412
01:38:50,281 --> 01:38:53,079
- You slept with him.
- I didn´t

1413
01:38:53,161 --> 01:38:56,198
- Polly, I love you.
- Liar!

1414
01:38:57,641 --> 01:38:59,552
Geoff told me, Mum.

1415
01:38:59,641 --> 01:39:02,792
All right, so if it wasn´t you,
who was that red-haired woman?

1416
01:39:02,881 --> 01:39:04,837
Oh, all right!

1417
01:39:07,721 --> 01:39:09,677
All right...

1418
01:39:11,441 --> 01:39:14,160
I´ll tell you. Just stop this.

1419
01:39:14,241 --> 01:39:16,197
Please

1420
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:50,994
You did it. She´s admitted everything.
Well done.

1421
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:54,231
She used her daughter and we did the same.
What´s the difference?

1422
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:00,393
Another retirement due to ill health?

1423
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:04,109
Give Greenlees a month and it´ll be
as if none of this ever happened.

1424
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:06,634
Well, it´s not our job, is it?

1425
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:10,349
- Should be. He´s as guilty as...
- Politics is what it´s all about.

1426
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:12,590
Politics!

1427
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:15,877
- Give me a cigarette, would you?
- I didn´t know you smoked.

1428
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,956
I don´t.
