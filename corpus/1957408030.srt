00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:32,336
Can you play with me?

2
00:00:33,903 --> 00:00:34,903
No.

3
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:38,038
Diane, play with her!

4
00:00:39,996 --> 00:00:41,954
Talk to the hand.

5
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:43,608
Whatever!

6
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:45,262
Come on, Ruth, come
dance with me.

7
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,249
Come on, show me what you got!

11
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:10,679
What are y'all in here doing?

12
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:12,768
You remember MC Hammer.

13
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:14,596
- Oh my goodness!
- Being annoying!

14
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:23,170
Any particular reason
why none of y'all

15
00:01:23,213 --> 00:01:26,434
can keep that noise down while
I'm trying to get some sleep?

16
00:01:26,477 --> 00:01:27,217
Honey, I'm sorry.

17
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:28,479
You want something to eat?

18
00:01:28,523 --> 00:01:30,243
Well, what I want is
some peace and quiet!

19
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:34,920
Girls, please tell your
father sorry for making noise.

20
00:01:35,573 --> 00:01:36,705
Uh, what?

21
00:01:36,748 --> 00:01:39,447
That's supposed to make
it all better?

22
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,232
That's supposed to get me
through the graveyard shift,

23
00:01:42,276 --> 00:01:45,583
some half-ass apology from
some ungrateful brats?

24
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:48,325
No, honey,
please don't talk like that.

25
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:49,761
What?

26
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:51,241
Bitch, you trying to tell me

27
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:52,895
how I can talk in my own house?

28
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:53,938
No.

29
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:57,117
Oh, oh, oh, so you
calling me a liar?

30
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,249
No, no, I just, no, uh-uh.

31
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:01,773
And what you caught
yourself doing?

32
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:03,993
You not gonna hit her again!

33
00:02:04,036 --> 00:02:04,863
Bitch, you gonna stop me?

34
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:06,169
If I have to!

35
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:08,867
Baby, baby, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

36
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:10,652
Just me and your father,
we're just gonna,

37
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:12,132
we're just gonna talk, okay?

38
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:13,133
It's gonna be all right.

39
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:14,873
Just gonna, just gonna...

40
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:18,573
Don't you disrespect
me in front of them kids.

41
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:20,009
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

42
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:21,508
Now go in there and
get them clothes off.

43
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:22,968
But baby, I don't
wanna do that...

44
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:24,318
Go in and get them clothes off

45
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:26,581
before I take 'em off you.

46
00:02:26,624 --> 00:02:27,624
Okay!

47
00:02:28,713 --> 00:02:31,281
No, no, no, no, what
are you doing?

48
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:32,326
Stop.

49
00:02:35,024 --> 00:02:36,024
Stop.

50
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:46,529
Fuck.

51
00:03:57,193 --> 00:03:59,195
Hey you, good morning.

52
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,677
No, no, no, no,
no, I only get down like that

53
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,069
when it's 2:00 a.m.
and I'm high,

54
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:09,292
and it's morning and I'm sober.

55
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:13,253
Come on, we can pretend
like it's 2:00 a.m.

56
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:16,168
Like I said, 2:00 a.m.
and high.

57
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:19,433
It's morning and you really
shouldn't even be here.

58
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:21,348
- Really?
- Yeah, I need you to go.

59
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:25,439
Come on.

60
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:28,703
Chop chop, get your shoes.

61
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:31,140
I guess that
goes for me too, huh?

62
00:04:31,183 --> 00:04:33,142
That especially
applies to your ass.

63
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:34,665
I need you up and dressed

64
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:36,145
and I need both of y'all out.

65
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:39,496
Come on.

66
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,890
Shoes, come on, chop, chop.

67
00:04:43,457 --> 00:04:44,501
Chop, chop!

68
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:50,899
Any day now.

69
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:57,905
So, um,

70
00:04:58,776 --> 00:05:00,691
so what's up, can I get
your phone number?

71
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:02,171
Why would I do that?

72
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:03,955
You were never here and
we never met.

73
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,000
Really?

74
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:11,588
I been calling you all night.

75
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:13,373
Why haven't you picked
up the phone?

76
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:20,336
I didn't pick up because I
went to the club last night,

77
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:23,861
I picked up two strangers,

78
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:27,169
I snorted everything
that I possibly could,

79
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:32,174
and then engaged in a
filthy one night stand.

80
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,480
Really?

81
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:37,397
I'm kidding, okay?

82
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,485
I was here.

83
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:40,530
I was praying and meditating.

84
00:06:40,574 --> 00:06:42,750
I needed some time to reflect.

85
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:46,057
Yeah, but why would
you even joke like that?

86
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:48,016
You know how my
sense of humor is.

87
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:51,541
But of all times,
like, really?

88
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:54,805
Yes, it's my mother's
funeral and I'm cracking jokes!

89
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:55,850
Fuck, sue me.

90
00:06:57,721 --> 00:06:59,810
Can we go now?

91
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:02,247
I'm waiting on you, as always.

92
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:10,430
Carl, we're gonna be late!

93
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,084
And?

94
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:15,652
Diane, don't look at
me like that!

95
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:16,977
Don't make me keep it
real with you.

96
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:19,439
You know your mama
didn't like me.

97
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:21,179
So what you saying?

98
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:23,355
I think it's pretty
clear what I'm saying.

99
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,836
Your mama didn't like me, so
if I'm late to the funeral,

100
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,534
it's not that big of a deal.

101
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:29,100
What about me?

102
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:30,711
So, let's say you
show up on time,

103
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:33,801
is she suddenly gonna raise up
and everything gonna be cool?

104
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,152
How could you say
something like that?

105
00:07:37,195 --> 00:07:38,501
How could you even
fix your mouth

106
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:39,850
to say something like that?

107
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:42,462
That is a very evil,
mean-spirited thing to say,

108
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:43,505
Carl.

109
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:48,163
When'd you
suddenly get so smart?

110
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:52,080
Man, get your stuff, come on,
let's go.

111
00:07:52,123 --> 00:07:54,952
And I hope your crazy sisters
ain't acting crazy today.

112
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,335
I don't have the
strength for this today.

113
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:31,380
I really don't.

114
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:33,904
Mom, it'll be fine.

115
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:36,124
You said earlier we'll
just do this last part

116
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,167
and we'll be off.

117
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:41,085
Yeah, I know,

118
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:45,394
but we're trying to get the
house sold and mom dying,

119
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:48,136
and then my sister's
foolishness?

120
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:52,836
I just want this to be over.

121
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,446
Oh, don't worry, honey,

122
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,667
it's almost over.

123
00:08:58,712 --> 00:09:00,931
Yeah, I don't even wanna go.

124
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:06,894
But I know this will be
the last time

125
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:10,114
I may very well step
foot in this old house.

126
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:12,421
Well then, let's not go.

127
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:13,988
Let's get ice cream instead.

128
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:16,120
Ooh, ice cream.

129
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:18,601
Yes, I'm down for that.

130
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:23,301
I can't do that.

131
00:09:24,346 --> 00:09:25,477
I gotta be there.

132
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:30,482
I'm the oldest so I
gotta represent.

133
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:34,182
Well, whatever we do,

134
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:35,618
we need to make a decision soon

135
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:37,577
because I gotta use
the bathroom!

136
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:40,928
Ooh, mama gotta tinkle!

137
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:45,280
Look, I made you smile.

138
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:47,412
We got this, you gonna be good.

139
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:52,461
Yeah.

140
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:37,593
I went to the funeral

141
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,900
and I'm coming to your
people's house.

142
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:44,382
I hope they know how to cook.

143
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,407
That was a really
nice service.

144
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:17,328
You really have some
nerve showing up here

145
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:20,114
at my mother's funeral.

146
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:22,072
Look, I don't know what
you think is going on,

147
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:23,508
but I came to support Carl.

148
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:27,034
Well, you can "support
Carl" some other time.

149
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:31,473
You hoes today have no
decency or self-respect.

150
00:11:31,516 --> 00:11:33,693
I'm not gonna beat you
and any of your little hoes,

151
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:35,564
and I'm not gonna go
back and forth with you.

152
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:36,913
Where's Carl?

153
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:38,045
Wait right here.

154
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,136
Oh, you stay out of this.

155
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:42,919
Let them handle it.

156
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:44,225
Your whore is here.

157
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:47,402
You invited her here like
I'm stupid.

158
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:49,380
I'm here to support you
and she here to support me.

159
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:50,448
Chill out, bruh.

160
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:51,643
She not family, why
is she here?

161
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:52,818
Damn, let's keep
your voice down...

162
00:11:52,842 --> 00:11:54,037
No, this is my mother's house,

163
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:55,255
are we clear?
You know what, Carl, Carl?

164
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,779
- Crazy ass sister.
- What is going on here?

165
00:11:56,803 --> 00:11:57,760
It's your sister.

166
00:11:57,804 --> 00:11:59,719
She assuming and she reacting.

167
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:00,894
Nah, nigga, that's you.

168
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:03,810
Because you done came way
too comfortable

169
00:12:03,853 --> 00:12:06,377
with disrespecting my
sister, and you know what?

170
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:07,596
I'm tired of that shit.

171
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:08,747
Hey, I know your mama died

172
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:09,879
but you need to get up
out of my face.

173
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:11,183
Whoa, this is my relationship.

174
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,602
I don't need you injecting.

175
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:15,430
I can handle my own business.

176
00:12:15,473 --> 00:12:16,473
Hey, all right.

177
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:19,694
But I'll tell you what,

178
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:23,655
if Carl don't get Miss Little
Chicky-Poo up outta here,

179
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:26,310
I'm about to be all up in it.

180
00:12:26,354 --> 00:12:27,418
See, I ain't got
time for this.

181
00:12:27,442 --> 00:12:28,660
Let's all go on back, I'm out.

182
00:12:28,704 --> 00:12:29,618
No, wait, just come
back, just come back.

183
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:30,662
Up off of me.

184
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:32,926
Come on, let's go.

185
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:40,324
You see what you did?

186
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:43,806
You pissed him off and
now he's gone!

187
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,332
Bitch, where is your spine?

188
00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:49,594
Get off of me.

189
00:12:49,638 --> 00:12:51,292
'Cause your
ass need to grow one.

190
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:53,120
Come on, come on, let's go.

191
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:54,774
Don't worry about her.
Dumbass.

192
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:57,646
And that dumb ass
Carl, I can't with him.

193
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:00,649
- Yeah.
- Lovely woman, lovely woman.

194
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,519
I'm sorry.

195
00:13:05,045 --> 00:13:07,482
I'm sorry, lovely, lovely woman.

196
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:08,396
Thank you.

197
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:10,137
I'm so glad you flew out here.

198
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:24,891
My sister started that shit.

199
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:27,173
We're just gonna take
them the cake

200
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:29,069
and that'll be it, hear me?

201
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:32,376
I don't know what I'm
gonna do, man.

202
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,291
You got your hands full.

203
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,641
Hey, Anita, glad you came.

204
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:40,254
Hey, Neil, it's good to see you.

205
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:41,733
Hey, unc, I brought a cake.

206
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:43,039
Should I put it back there?

207
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:47,043
Yeah, right
there in the kitchen.

208
00:13:48,566 --> 00:13:49,393
What?

209
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:51,439
What're you talking about?

210
00:13:51,482 --> 00:13:53,267
What are you still doing
with that Carl?

211
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,095
I mean, come on, it's
been since high school.

212
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:57,880
Don't judge me, please,
not today.

213
00:13:57,924 --> 00:13:59,012
Please don't.
Okay.

214
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:01,623
Hey, Niecy!

215
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,625
Oh, dang, she didn't even
look your way.

216
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:04,887
Who?

217
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:07,150
Oh, why do y'all always
gotta act like that?

218
00:14:07,194 --> 00:14:08,301
This is our family.
Girl, I'm not worried

219
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:10,197
about her, I'm just
here for my mama.

220
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,938
I know, but you know.

221
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:13,591
Hey, handsome, how you doing?

222
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:15,071
Good, how are you?

223
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:16,483
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to see you.

224
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:18,031
Nice to meet you.

225
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:21,251
It seems like they can't
get together for nothing, man.

226
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,824
I know you not
just gonna walk past us

227
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,019
and not acknowledge us all day.

228
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:30,826
See what I mean?

229
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,827
Well, that was the plan.

230
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,089
Really?

231
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:34,545
You really need to get
over yourself right now.

232
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:35,700
Hey, Niece.

233
00:14:35,744 --> 00:14:37,354
You seem to have a
problem over there.

234
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:38,486
You good?

235
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:39,313
No, I don't like how
you're talking

236
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:40,227
to my mother, so.

237
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,271
Oh, so it is a problem.

238
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:42,577
What's up?

239
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,578
Hold up, hold up, ladies,

240
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:44,971
hold up, hold up, please.

241
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:47,103
Listen, you not gonna
talk to her like that.

242
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:48,278
What did I do?

243
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:49,149
All I did was walk into
the house and...

244
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:50,150
Go outside, Niece.

245
00:14:50,193 --> 00:14:51,673
You need to sit
down somewhere.

246
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:53,414
Hey, hey, come on,

247
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:54,154
Come on, come on.
Niece,

248
00:14:54,197 --> 00:14:55,024
don't worry about it.

249
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,132
Don't worry, just have a seat.

250
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:57,437
I got this.
Uncle Will, for real?

251
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:59,768
Just have a seat, all right?

252
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:02,162
Really, like wow.

253
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:03,467
What's really going on?

254
00:15:03,511 --> 00:15:04,381
I don't understand.

255
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:05,992
What did I do?

256
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:07,056
We have to find some
way to be nice.

257
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,472
All I did was walk
in the house!

258
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:11,345
I know, I'm not trying
to get involved.

259
00:15:11,388 --> 00:15:12,737
Oh my God!

260
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:14,174
It's so irritating.

261
00:15:14,217 --> 00:15:15,436
You okay though?

262
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:17,394
I'm good but like,

263
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:19,135
why is everybody
starting with me?

264
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:20,397
I don't know.

265
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:24,010
Like, really?

266
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:25,402
What?

267
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:28,318
I mean, what's
wrong, like, can you relax?

268
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:30,451
Try and be a little more
open with me now.

269
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:31,495
No.

270
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:32,366
I really don't understand

271
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:34,368
what's going on here, all right?

272
00:15:34,411 --> 00:15:36,196
I know this is family
matters but...

273
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:46,510
I'm just, I'm ready to
go, honestly, already.

274
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:49,296
I mean, we can if you want to.

275
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:51,646
I'm leaving, I'm not
staying here.

276
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,040
Come on, girl.

277
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,606
Let's go get your baby.

278
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,045
Hey, Niece.

279
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:00,220
Hey, Giselle.

280
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:01,656
I'm getting ready to go.

281
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:03,179
All right, Niece.

282
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:05,660
I'll see you later, all right?

283
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:07,377
Listen, I want y'all to
call me later, all right?

284
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:08,924
All right.

285
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,510
Come by the house, we can
take care of this, all right?

286
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:11,361
I will.

287
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:12,536
All right, take care.

288
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:14,234
Come on.

289
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:15,017
All right, come on.

290
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:15,887
Ooh, you know what?

291
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:18,890
We can get your ice cream now!

292
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:21,806
Gotta get your mind off that,
okay?

293
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:39,823
Can we talk?

294
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:42,978
Well, seeing how you
just sat down there,

295
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,179
it looks like we about to,
so what's up?

296
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,398
Why?

297
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:51,445
Why do you continue to
disrespect me?

298
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:53,316
What on earth are you
blabbering about?

299
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,665
About everything.

300
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,363
The way you talk to me,

301
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:57,799
the other women?

302
00:16:57,842 --> 00:17:01,933
Diane, you starting to
sound like the same old song.

303
00:17:01,977 --> 00:17:04,414
Oh, for Jesus Christ, Carl!

304
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:07,287
For once in our
relationship, just be honest.

305
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:10,159
If I've ever meant
anything to you, ever,

306
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:11,987
just give me one honest moment.

307
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,989
Okay, okay.

308
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:14,816
You want some honesty?

309
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:15,904
Yes!

310
00:17:15,947 --> 00:17:17,775
Go ahead, ask me
whatever you want.

311
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,169
Just remember you
wanted this honesty.

312
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:21,344
Okay.

313
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:22,780
Well, when I see you
with Janita?

314
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:24,869
Man, she's just a friend.

315
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:26,958
Stop playing games, Carl.

316
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:28,873
You said you'd be honest!

317
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:32,659
Okay.

318
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:38,970
Well, when you talk to her,
it's always with respect,

319
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:41,712
but you've never treated
me with anything like that.

320
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:46,065
Hurry up and get to
where you going with this.

321
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,416
What is that you see in her

322
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:51,026
that you don't see in me?

323
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,942
Well, one, there's the fact
that she'd never play herself

324
00:17:53,985 --> 00:17:55,987
to even ask me something
silly like that.

325
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,994
But I love you, Carl.

326
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,128
I love you too, Diane,
but I'm about to do me.

327
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:08,609
You can either accept
it or not, it's on you.

328
00:18:08,652 --> 00:18:10,524
And remember, you
wanted this honesty.

329
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:12,656
But what can I do to
make you love me more?

330
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,288
Well, first, Diane, just plop
yourself down here in front

331
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:19,620
of the TV and try harder
and I'll let you know.

332
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:32,371
Hey.

333
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:34,069
Yeah, man.

334
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,220
I'm gonna slide through there.

335
00:18:35,244 --> 00:18:38,421
She's just getting them
on my nerves.

336
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:39,465
A'ight.

337
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:42,512
Hey, don't wait up, man.

338
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:43,836
I'm about to go shoot some pool.

339
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:46,081
Well, why bother with the lie?

340
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,605
We both know where you're going.

341
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:50,651
Habit, I guess.

342
00:18:50,694 --> 00:18:52,305
Just be ready to uh,

343
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:54,742
perform for daddy when I
get back, a'ight?

344
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:56,546
Ain't you gonna get enough
performance over there?

345
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,417
Hey, don't worry about what
I'm gonna get up over there.

346
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:02,141
You just worry about
handling your business.

347
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:03,751
You gonna be ready?

348
00:19:04,926 --> 00:19:06,319
I can't hear you.

349
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:11,933
All right, then, I'm out.

350
00:19:11,976 --> 00:19:13,456
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

351
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:16,503
I'll do whatever you want.

352
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:18,200
Just come back, okay?

353
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:20,507
Don't I always?

354
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:43,138
Do you think there could be

355
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,923
some important correlation
with your relationships

356
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:50,101
with your, your sisters and
your mother and father that, uh,

357
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:54,932
that's preventing you from
having a successful relationship

358
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:56,630
now with your husband?

359
00:19:56,673 --> 00:19:58,980
At first I didn't
think so, but you know,

360
00:19:59,023 --> 00:20:01,200
looking back in it, uh, yeah.

361
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:02,897
I used to, uh,

362
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,769
well, me and, you know,
my sisters, uh,

363
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:09,338
would sit there and just
watch my dad smack my mom

364
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:12,602
and she would just be helpless.

365
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:13,995
She, she wouldn't do anything.

366
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:15,562
She wouldn't fight back.

367
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:17,825
When you've been with
someone since high school

368
00:20:17,868 --> 00:20:19,672
and you know, they're your
best friend, you know,

369
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:23,352
and as you go down the line,
you know, people change,

370
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:27,226
and you know, things happen,
you know?

371
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,204
I loved him and, you know,
at the time he, you know,

372
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,141
he loved me.

373
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:32,318
I believe it, but you know,

374
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:35,321
after time passes, you
know, you get the subtlety

375
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:38,367
and you know, the mental abuse,

376
00:20:38,411 --> 00:20:40,543
and then it just becomes
blatant disrespect.

377
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:46,332
And I have done everything
that I've can to appeal to him,

378
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,333
to please him,

379
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:50,510
but it just, it won't stop.

380
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:53,556
The disrespect just,
just won't stop,

381
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,731
and that's all I want.

382
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:56,385
I just want it to stop

383
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:58,213
'cause at this point
I'm just tired.

384
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:33,117
Look, I wanted to go
to a nice gym

385
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:37,121
where there is air conditioning
and everything else, okay?

386
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:40,429
Anyway, what you got
planned this weekend?

387
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:45,304
I gotta go
link up with uncle William.

388
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:46,130
Oh, uncle Will?

389
00:21:46,174 --> 00:21:47,480
I love him.

390
00:21:47,523 --> 00:21:49,917
Uh, what y'all got going on?

391
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,721
Well, you know, he cleaning
out my mom's old house.

392
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:53,137
Oh.

393
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:55,966
So he says she got something
that she left for me.

394
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,403
Okay, some
keepsakes and stuff?

395
00:21:57,446 --> 00:21:58,795
That's nice.

396
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:02,233
Well, I wouldn't necessarily
say it's a keepsake.

397
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,671
It's a leather coat.

398
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:06,760
A old leather coat, really?

399
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:07,954
After everything you
done been through,

400
00:22:07,978 --> 00:22:09,023
all you get is a coat?

401
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:10,154
Come on now.

402
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:13,201
It's, it's not just a
leather coat.

403
00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:14,724
It was, it was special.

404
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:17,553
Okay, I get that.

405
00:22:17,597 --> 00:22:18,946
Hell, it may have been

406
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:21,775
one of the only good things
my dad ever gave her.

407
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:25,387
And she would put it on
and you know,

408
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:27,302
she would instantly like,

409
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,696
get out of this depressed
mood that she was having.

410
00:22:30,697 --> 00:22:32,525
Ooh, you just gave me chills.

411
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:34,004
I remember all that.

412
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:35,745
Yeah.

413
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:38,182
And you know my mom
didn't smile much,

414
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:42,143
but, when she, when she did,

415
00:22:43,013 --> 00:22:44,711
it meant something.

416
00:22:46,234 --> 00:22:50,325
So I gotta make sure I go
get it and take care of it.

417
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:52,936
I understand.

418
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,566
Well, I just want to
let you know you've been

419
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,244
so strong through all this.

420
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:57,376
I know I couldn't,

421
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:00,944
I could not do everything
you've been through.

422
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:03,643
You've just been so strong
and I'm so proud of you.

423
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:06,254
Aw, I appreciate that, Sara.

424
00:23:06,297 --> 00:23:07,168
I do.
Yeah, well, you know,

425
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:08,735
you need anything, I got you.

426
00:23:09,562 --> 00:23:10,519
Okay.

427
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:11,757
Well, right now I
need a burrito,

428
00:23:11,781 --> 00:23:12,845
so that's where we need to go.

429
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:15,263
Burritos and cocktails!

430
00:23:15,306 --> 00:23:17,657
Right, you ready?

431
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,745
Yes!

432
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:33,907
Hey, girl.

433
00:24:35,604 --> 00:24:38,912
Yeah, thank you so much
for being there

434
00:24:38,955 --> 00:24:40,609
and helping me with
mom's funeral.

435
00:24:41,784 --> 00:24:43,656
I really appreciate it.

436
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:50,750
No, I haven't heard from
neither one of my sisters.

437
00:24:54,101 --> 00:24:56,277
No, I'm not okay with it.

438
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,800
Well, what am I supposed to do?

439
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:03,806
I've been doing that.

440
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,592
I've been reaching out.

441
00:25:07,593 --> 00:25:09,420
I've always taken initiative,

442
00:25:09,464 --> 00:25:13,512
and when I do it always seems
like they just reject it.

443
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:14,991
I'm tired of that.

444
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:16,645
Still weeping for
your sisters?

445
00:25:21,258 --> 00:25:23,870
Sara, I'm gonna call you back.

446
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,355
Why would you say
something like that?

447
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:34,054
Because every time
I look around

448
00:25:34,097 --> 00:25:35,446
you're either talking about them

449
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,144
or you look like
you're gonna cry.

450
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:40,626
They are my sisters.

451
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:43,300
Well, I don't know
why you're acting

452
00:25:43,324 --> 00:25:44,847
like they're so important.

453
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:46,806
If they're tripping,
forget about them.

454
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,940
I can't
just forget about them.

455
00:25:50,984 --> 00:25:52,507
You can't do that with family.

456
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:55,249
It's easier said than done.

457
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,559
Sometimes I wish you
loved me how you love them,

458
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:02,082
or Ruth at least.

459
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:04,301
That girl could literally
spit in your face

460
00:26:04,345 --> 00:26:06,608
and you'd still do
something to help that girl.

461
00:26:10,351 --> 00:26:11,439
That's not true.

462
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:12,482
Anything.

463
00:26:14,268 --> 00:26:15,268
I wish that were true,

464
00:26:16,357 --> 00:26:18,272
but Ruth has always been
first with you

465
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,580
and she doesn't even
care about you.

466
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,716
Hey, uncle William.

467
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:13,632
Hey, niece, how you doing?

468
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:16,591
- Mhm.
- How you doing, baby?

469
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,418
I'm good, you?

470
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:18,767
You look good.

471
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:21,204
I bet you say
that to all the girls.

472
00:27:21,248 --> 00:27:23,598
Nah, but
with you I really mean it.

473
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,642
So how's it going?

474
00:27:25,078 --> 00:27:26,514
I'm all right.

475
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:29,212
I wasn't feeling what happened
at that repass though.

476
00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:30,518
Yeah, well, you know,

477
00:27:30,561 --> 00:27:32,433
wasn't none of us feeling that

478
00:27:32,476 --> 00:27:34,217
with your sister
chasing after dude

479
00:27:35,523 --> 00:27:36,829
and y'all arguing.

480
00:27:38,221 --> 00:27:39,938
I mean, we gonna have to
really talk about this.

481
00:27:39,962 --> 00:27:40,963
Mhm.

482
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:42,332
Because what y'all
are going through

483
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:44,488
it's gonna have to really
stop, baby, seriously.

484
00:27:44,532 --> 00:27:45,751
Hey, uncle.

485
00:27:45,794 --> 00:27:47,250
- Hey, what's up, niece?
- How are you?

486
00:27:47,274 --> 00:27:49,015
I'm good, it's good to
see you, girl.

487
00:27:49,058 --> 00:27:51,060
- Good to see you.
- Go on, have a seat.

488
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:55,282
Well, look what the
cat drug in.

489
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:58,154
Hello, Diane.

490
00:27:58,198 --> 00:27:59,721
I wasn't expecting to
see you here.

491
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:00,983
And why not?

492
00:28:01,027 --> 00:28:04,160
When my uncle asks me to
be somewhere, I'm there.

493
00:28:04,204 --> 00:28:05,945
Well, I wish you
would've had that mindset

494
00:28:05,988 --> 00:28:07,294
when mama was still living.

495
00:28:07,337 --> 00:28:08,512
Why would I have to?

496
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:10,384
She had her precious
little Giselle.

497
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:11,907
Come on, y'all, come on.

498
00:28:11,951 --> 00:28:13,648
Are these two chicks
arguing again?

499
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:14,780
What's up, Niecy?

500
00:28:14,823 --> 00:28:15,650
Hey.

501
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,956
It's good to see you, baby.

502
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:19,654
So, uncle, if this is
what this is gonna be,

503
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,414
can you just give me the
coat that my mom left me

504
00:28:21,438 --> 00:28:22,178
so I can go?

505
00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:23,136
About that jacket...

506
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:24,615
- Hold on, uncle!
- Coat, what?

507
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:25,897
You said my mother left
a coat for me.

508
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:27,880
Nah, nah, no.

509
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:29,533
You said the coat was for me.

510
00:28:29,577 --> 00:28:31,100
Oh, Jesus.

511
00:28:31,144 --> 00:28:33,929
Now, I done came over here
all the way from where I came

512
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:35,670
from because you said
that coat was for me.

513
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,106
Wait a minute, hold up.

514
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,455
Hold up, calm down.

515
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:39,737
Hey, listen, calm down!
I'm the oldest!

516
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:41,067
I don't care!

517
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,852
Take your old ass...
Calm down, wait a minute!

518
00:28:43,896 --> 00:28:45,288
Wait a minute, please!

519
00:28:45,332 --> 00:28:46,570
I'm trying to tell
you something.

520
00:28:46,594 --> 00:28:47,421
- Old ass, bitch.
- Y'all stop it.

521
00:28:47,464 --> 00:28:48,509
Stop it right now!

522
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:49,660
Girl, that table!

523
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:51,338
- I wish you would.
- Y'all calm down!

524
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:52,576
I wish you would!
Don't make me come

525
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,620
across that table, Ruth!
I wish you would.

526
00:28:53,644 --> 00:28:54,428
I wish you would.
Look.

527
00:28:54,471 --> 00:28:55,690
- Diane.
- Man.

528
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,387
- I wish you would.
- Listen.

529
00:28:57,431 --> 00:29:00,303
When your mother found out
she was finna die, man,

530
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:02,741
she made me make a
promise to get y'all here

531
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:04,481
so we can hash out all
our differences.

532
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:08,703
Uncle, I don't have
no differences.

533
00:29:09,922 --> 00:29:13,708
These are my sisters
and I love 'em,

534
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,275
but I don't like they asses.

535
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:19,758
I don't like they little
funny ass ways.

536
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:23,650
I don't like things
about you either.

537
00:29:23,674 --> 00:29:24,719
Shut up.

538
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,808
I got differences,
plenty of them.

539
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,769
I don't have any
differences at all.

540
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:31,465
I do my own thing.

541
00:29:31,508 --> 00:29:33,075
Always have.

542
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,749
- Ruth, man, I got a question.
- Well, good for you!

543
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,383
Hold on, I got a
question for you.

544
00:29:37,906 --> 00:29:39,362
You say you ain't got no
differences with your sisters.

545
00:29:39,386 --> 00:29:40,866
Nope.

546
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:43,390
But lately you've been seeming
like the most hostile one.

547
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:44,521
What?

548
00:29:44,565 --> 00:29:47,220
Okay, I guess because
I'm the youngest

549
00:29:47,263 --> 00:29:49,222
these two smothered me
my whole life.

550
00:29:49,265 --> 00:29:50,266
Smother?

551
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,921
I just, I'm grown now

552
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:55,881
and I just want my
space from them.

553
00:29:55,924 --> 00:29:56,924
Smothering you?

554
00:29:57,926 --> 00:30:00,581
Chick, I ain't
pay one minute of attention

555
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:02,975
to you since they brought
you home from the hospital.

556
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:06,543
And that's about
how much attention I paid you.

557
00:30:06,587 --> 00:30:09,155
Giselle is the one I'm
talking about.

558
00:30:09,198 --> 00:30:10,373
What?

559
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:11,635
What are you talking about?

560
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:12,767
Wow.

561
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,029
Ever since we were little,

562
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:18,164
you always been all over
me trying to control me.

563
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:20,688
She was so jealous of
me when we were little,

564
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:22,646
anytime I would try to
sit next to mama

565
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,519
she'll wedge herself right
in the middle.

566
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:28,348
I couldn't even have a
relationship with our mother

567
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:30,872
because she was always nearby.

568
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:33,048
Butting in and trying to
influence her.

569
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:36,922
And mama fell for that shit.

570
00:30:36,965 --> 00:30:40,360
Like any decision that she
wanted to make,

571
00:30:40,403 --> 00:30:42,536
she will call Giselle in
order to make it.

572
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:47,758
I just, honestly, I
can't wait to live a life

573
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:49,586
where there's no Giselle in it.

574
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:55,417
Okay.

575
00:30:59,074 --> 00:31:00,074
Okay.

576
00:31:03,644 --> 00:31:04,795
Why you gotta talk like that?

577
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:06,168
What, I'm being honest?

578
00:31:06,212 --> 00:31:07,474
That's what I'm saying.

579
00:31:07,517 --> 00:31:08,755
Y'all are fighting over
here like cats

580
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:11,217
and dogs all the time.
Oh my God.

581
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,087
God.

582
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:13,654
Shouldn't even be here.

583
00:31:13,697 --> 00:31:14,829
Giselle, wait.

584
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:17,005
Get back over here and sit down

585
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:18,528
so we can finish this, please.

586
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:24,317
Does anybody else wanna tell
me how I've ruined they life

587
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:27,233
or how they don't want me in it?

588
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,325
Well, like I said,
I've got issues,

589
00:31:32,368 --> 00:31:34,283
self-esteem issues,

590
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:36,416
because I didn't have the
love and support I needed

591
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:38,244
from my sisters.

592
00:31:38,287 --> 00:31:40,246
Are you about to blame
your shitty life

593
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:42,161
and shitty choices on us?
Ruth!

594
00:31:42,204 --> 00:31:43,727
What?

595
00:31:43,771 --> 00:31:45,338
Go ahead, Diane.

596
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:48,210
Well, this one has
been distant towards me

597
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:50,256
since we were teenagers

598
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:53,694
and this one, just differences.

599
00:31:53,737 --> 00:31:56,479
It's like we're not
even sisters.

600
00:31:56,523 --> 00:31:59,569
I never had the love and
support that I needed from them.

601
00:32:04,531 --> 00:32:05,880
You know what?

602
00:32:08,622 --> 00:32:10,363
Who were you there to support?

603
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:14,541
Who were you ever there for?

604
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:15,890
Certainly not me.

605
00:32:18,197 --> 00:32:20,373
You was in the streets, honey,

606
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:23,550
being this little
weak ass lab doll

607
00:32:23,593 --> 00:32:26,205
behind some little
nigga named Carl.

608
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:29,948
As a matter of fact,
where Carl at?

609
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:32,211
- Who was I ever there for?
- Mhm.

610
00:32:32,254 --> 00:32:35,518
I never had the chance
to be there for anyone.

611
00:32:35,562 --> 00:32:38,043
My life has been ruined
since we were teenagers

612
00:32:38,086 --> 00:32:42,699
because I told someone my
deepest secret

613
00:32:42,743 --> 00:32:44,310
and they avoided me.

614
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,921
Shame to me.

615
00:32:49,184 --> 00:32:50,620
So, no,

616
00:32:50,664 --> 00:32:53,754
I didn't have any strength
to be there for anyone else.

617
00:32:53,797 --> 00:32:56,800
What the hell is this
chick vibing?

618
00:32:56,844 --> 00:32:59,107
- I was raped.
- Oh, no!

619
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:02,981
I was raped at 14 and
I told my big sister

620
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:06,985
and she tried to beat me up.
Jesus.

621
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:09,465
Tried to fight me.

622
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,425
Then she avoided me

623
00:33:14,122 --> 00:33:16,211
because I guess she
didn't wanna see me.

624
00:33:20,346 --> 00:33:21,346
Yeah.

625
00:33:22,826 --> 00:33:24,002
I tried to fight you

626
00:33:28,441 --> 00:33:30,269
'cause I was mad as hell!

627
00:33:31,313 --> 00:33:32,401
You didn't listen!

628
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:37,102
I told you do not go down
to that studio

629
00:33:37,145 --> 00:33:40,888
because all they do is take
advantage of young girls!

630
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:42,063
And what did you do?

631
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:47,155
You took your little stupid
ass down there anyway!

632
00:33:48,765 --> 00:33:50,985
Even though I told you!

633
00:33:53,118 --> 00:33:54,728
Nobody was avoiding you!

634
00:33:56,991 --> 00:33:58,819
I was working.

635
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:00,516
So you wouldn't
have to see me.

636
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,823
Oh my God, girl,
are you stupid

637
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:04,172
or are you blind?

638
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,392
Shit, you probably both!

639
00:34:08,394 --> 00:34:12,224
I was working so that I
could save money

640
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:15,096
to buy a weapon.

641
00:34:16,445 --> 00:34:17,968
A weapon?

642
00:34:18,012 --> 00:34:20,623
There wasn't no school
clothes for me.

643
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:22,712
There wasn't no summertime off.

644
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,586
Every got-damn dime that I saved

645
00:34:27,543 --> 00:34:29,719
went into me buying a gun!

646
00:34:29,763 --> 00:34:32,287
- What?
- Gun?

647
00:34:47,433 --> 00:34:50,175
What's going on, I heard
you was looking for me?

648
00:34:50,218 --> 00:34:51,524
Yeah.

649
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:53,439
I heard you the one to
see about a gun.

650
00:34:56,442 --> 00:34:57,878
No arms sales down to kids.

651
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:00,707
Well, I ain't no kid.

652
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,795
I'm 17.

653
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,102
You got the money?

654
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:07,714
Yeah, I got about a G.

655
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:10,412
That's about the right price.

656
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:14,329
Let's do some work with
me right here.

657
00:35:32,304 --> 00:35:33,566
How do I use it?

658
00:36:11,081 --> 00:36:15,477
So let's just say I did
whatever I needed to do

659
00:36:15,521 --> 00:36:18,437
to get done what needed
to be handled.

660
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:28,142
You remember how the news
said homie died

661
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,275
from some like, gang
beef gone bad

662
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:32,799
or some drug deal shit?

663
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:36,324
Yeah.

664
00:36:36,368 --> 00:36:37,717
Well, it wasn't none of that.

665
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:41,285
It was me.

666
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:49,424
Oh, God.

667
00:36:49,468 --> 00:36:50,468
Mama knew.

668
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,825
But we just never
talked about it.

669
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:20,933
I'm sorry.

670
00:37:25,112 --> 00:37:26,112
I'm sorry.

671
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,554
That was wow.

672
00:37:32,598 --> 00:37:34,426
That was, gotta admit,

673
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:35,688
that was beautiful.

674
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:37,690
Oh my God.

675
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:38,733
You know what?

676
00:37:40,388 --> 00:37:41,694
Take the coat,

677
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:44,131
split it in two,

678
00:37:44,174 --> 00:37:46,002
and enjoy your new
sisterly love.

679
00:37:46,046 --> 00:37:49,571
I am so glad that worked
out for the two of you.

680
00:37:49,615 --> 00:37:50,877
No, Ruth, no.

681
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,202
No, no, Ruth.
Wow, that was amazing.

682
00:37:52,226 --> 00:37:53,183
No, don't, please.

683
00:37:53,227 --> 00:37:55,011
Please don't go.

684
00:37:55,055 --> 00:37:57,318
We can't re-heal from this.

685
00:37:57,362 --> 00:37:58,493
Now, will you just sit?

686
00:37:58,537 --> 00:38:00,800
Unlike you,

687
00:38:00,843 --> 00:38:02,367
nobody killed anyone for me.

688
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:05,195
And to be honest,

689
00:38:06,588 --> 00:38:08,590
I never really had a
relationship with our mother

690
00:38:08,634 --> 00:38:09,939
like the two of you.

691
00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:12,899
I guess because I came
so much later.

692
00:38:14,117 --> 00:38:16,119
I didn't even get to have
a bond with her.

693
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:20,733
All I had was a big
sister to babysit me all day,

694
00:38:20,776 --> 00:38:23,301
every day and a creep of a dad.

695
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:26,216
Creep of a dad?

696
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,957
What the hell is she
talking about?

697
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:30,830
Oh, he skipped you guys' room.

698
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:34,181
Before our dad died,

699
00:38:34,224 --> 00:38:36,705
he used to come into my
room every night

700
00:38:36,749 --> 00:38:37,227
to tuck me in.

701
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:38,533
Or wait,

702
00:38:38,577 --> 00:38:42,407
should I say tuck himself
into my bed every night?

703
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,192
And mama knew what was going on.

704
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:48,282
Her weak ass knew and she
didn't do shit to protect me.

705
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,979
Watch what you say
about my mother.

706
00:38:50,023 --> 00:38:51,329
Yeah, yeah, your mother.

707
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:52,634
She wasn't a mother to me.

708
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,076
That's because she
wasn't your mother.

709
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,600
Giselle!

710
00:39:03,036 --> 00:39:04,385
What are you talking about?

711
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:06,518
Uncle William?

712
00:39:06,561 --> 00:39:07,997
It's time she knows.

713
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:11,305
What is she talking about?

714
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,393
Uncle William?

715
00:39:16,528 --> 00:39:17,703
She, she,

716
00:39:20,096 --> 00:39:21,489
she wasn't your mother!

717
00:39:23,012 --> 00:39:26,276
Why would you even say
something like that, Giselle?

718
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,671
I wasn't just babysitting you

719
00:39:29,715 --> 00:39:30,846
for all those years.

720
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:34,110
I wasn't just keeping
you close to me

721
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:38,332
because I just wanted to
be this perfect big sister.

722
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,812
Could've fooled me.

723
00:39:43,163 --> 00:39:44,382
I'm your mother, Ruth.

724
00:39:48,516 --> 00:39:50,344
Why would you even
say something like that?

725
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,956
I was 13 when I got
pregnant with you.

726
00:39:55,131 --> 00:39:57,569
So the answer is no,

727
00:39:57,612 --> 00:39:59,266
he did not skip my room!

728
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:07,969
You're lying.

729
00:40:10,016 --> 00:40:11,016
You're lying!

730
00:40:13,193 --> 00:40:15,195
She's lying right now.

731
00:40:15,238 --> 00:40:19,417
Listen, mama sent
me down south.

732
00:40:22,071 --> 00:40:23,812
She sent me down south

733
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,774
and when I had you
and I came back,

734
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:34,040
she made sure that I knew

735
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:36,695
that you, you were not
gonna be my daughter!

736
00:40:38,044 --> 00:40:39,785
You were gonna be my sister,

737
00:40:42,222 --> 00:40:45,704
but I was to protect
you at all costs.

738
00:40:55,017 --> 00:40:57,411
So when I heard that he
was creeping in your room,

739
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,805
I had to do what I had to do.

740
00:41:02,242 --> 00:41:05,854
I had to protect you.

741
00:41:07,987 --> 00:41:10,032
What are you talking about?

742
00:41:19,651 --> 00:41:20,651
Giselle?

743
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:23,742
Daddy didn't die of a
heart attack.

744
00:41:23,785 --> 00:41:25,439
Giselle.

745
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,701
Oh, God.
What?

746
00:41:29,661 --> 00:41:31,227
I poisoned him.

747
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:32,271
Jesus.

748
00:41:34,622 --> 00:41:36,189
I poisoned him to protect you.

749
00:42:19,058 --> 00:42:20,058
Ruth?

750
00:42:25,455 --> 00:42:26,455
I'm sorry.

751
00:42:29,372 --> 00:42:31,897
I'm sorry you had to find
out like this.

752
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,159
All of these years

753
00:42:35,944 --> 00:42:37,642
I didn't even know who
my real mom was.

754
00:42:39,121 --> 00:42:41,733
And out of all the time,
you decide to tell me today?

755
00:42:46,389 --> 00:42:47,608
I was a baby!

756
00:42:48,696 --> 00:42:50,611
I didn't know what to do!

757
00:42:50,655 --> 00:42:52,570
And I, I didn't know
what to say!

758
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:57,618
And mom, well, she was,

759
00:42:57,662 --> 00:43:02,101
she was just so clear on
what needed to be done,

760
00:43:02,144 --> 00:43:04,277
so I just...
Clear?

761
00:43:05,713 --> 00:43:08,586
It would've been clear to
know who my mother was.

762
00:43:10,109 --> 00:43:11,632
But I was there.

763
00:43:13,112 --> 00:43:14,592
I was, I was there!

764
00:43:14,635 --> 00:43:18,508
You, you might not have
known who I biologically was,

765
00:43:18,552 --> 00:43:21,033
but I was there!

766
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,341
I don't even like,

767
00:43:25,385 --> 00:43:28,388
know what to say to you
at this point.

768
00:43:28,431 --> 00:43:32,522
I don't even know how to talk
to you besides as a sister.

769
00:43:35,351 --> 00:43:36,744
Wait, what do we even do?

770
00:43:40,748 --> 00:43:42,402
Can I at least have a,

771
00:43:43,925 --> 00:43:45,100
can I at least have a hug?

772
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:48,582
I, I'm sorry.
No, no, don't.

773
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,977
Seriously, don't even touch me
right now, please, just move.

774
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:09,646
Oh, God.

775
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,060
Hello?

776
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:36,499
Hey, Brian, how are you?

777
00:44:38,414 --> 00:44:41,809
Yeah, I'm just at home chilling.

778
00:44:44,116 --> 00:44:45,726
Yes, I am alone.

779
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:48,207
Wow, you are so insecure.

780
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,557
That is a huge turn off.

781
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:56,911
Well, you should
learn to trust me by now.

782
00:44:56,955 --> 00:44:59,697
I would never do anything to
jeopardize our relationship.

783
00:45:03,135 --> 00:45:07,269
Okay, well, can I get
back to chilling then?

784
00:45:09,184 --> 00:45:11,143
All right, I'll talk
to you later.

785
00:45:20,979 --> 00:45:22,458
Yeah.

786
00:45:22,502 --> 00:45:25,374
Well, thank you for taking me
to my first therapy session.

787
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,377
I know,

788
00:45:28,421 --> 00:45:29,814
I know you don't know this,

789
00:45:29,857 --> 00:45:33,339
but Ruth is my daughter.

790
00:45:34,296 --> 00:45:35,384
She's your what?

791
00:45:38,257 --> 00:45:39,562
She's my daughter.

792
00:45:39,606 --> 00:45:43,088
Oh my goodness, oh.

793
00:45:43,131 --> 00:45:45,438
And this, I don't,

794
00:45:45,481 --> 00:45:48,223
girl, what are you talking
about, Ruth is your daughter?

795
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:53,663
There's just some
things that we don't,

796
00:45:53,707 --> 00:45:55,970
we don't talk about
in my family.

797
00:45:56,014 --> 00:45:58,799
Oh.

798
00:45:58,843 --> 00:46:00,453
I'm your best friend.

799
00:46:00,496 --> 00:46:01,802
You can't come and tell me?

800
00:46:01,846 --> 00:46:04,370
I've been knowing you
for 15 years.

801
00:46:04,413 --> 00:46:07,068
I see you every day,
five days a week,

802
00:46:07,112 --> 00:46:09,288
and you couldn't tell me that?

803
00:46:10,419 --> 00:46:13,509
Oh my God, this is,
this is crazy.

804
00:46:13,553 --> 00:46:16,904
I, I, I am just.

805
00:46:16,948 --> 00:46:19,167
- I'm sorry.
- Oh my God.

806
00:46:19,211 --> 00:46:20,168
I couldn't tell you.

807
00:46:20,212 --> 00:46:21,866
It's, it's just, it's,

808
00:46:21,909 --> 00:46:24,912
it's been a lot going on,
you know?

809
00:46:24,956 --> 00:46:26,479
Losing my mom,

810
00:46:26,522 --> 00:46:30,831
having this, this big secret
come out after all this time,

811
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:32,485
it's, it's a lot.

812
00:46:32,528 --> 00:46:34,443
Hi, Giselle, how are
you doing today?

813
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,838
Good, it's really good to
see you again.

814
00:46:38,926 --> 00:46:41,363
Well, why don't you fill me in

815
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,191
on the update about you
and your sisters;

816
00:46:43,235 --> 00:46:44,429
how are you guys getting along,

817
00:46:44,453 --> 00:46:45,803
and your daughter, of course?

818
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:51,547
Well, the relationship
with my daughter is

819
00:46:51,591 --> 00:46:52,722
it's going well.

820
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:58,032
I think we had a chance to, uh,
you know,

821
00:46:58,076 --> 00:46:59,947
really clear the air
on some things,

822
00:46:59,991 --> 00:47:02,994
and, uh, I just
wanted her to know

823
00:47:03,037 --> 00:47:07,128
that regardless of the
decisions that I made,

824
00:47:07,172 --> 00:47:11,437
that I, you know, I didn't
necessarily come forward with

825
00:47:12,351 --> 00:47:13,656
and tell the truth right away,

826
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,573
that, that I always loved her.

827
00:47:17,617 --> 00:47:18,618
That's okay.

828
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:19,661
Um...

829
00:47:21,316 --> 00:47:26,147
As far as Diane is concerned,
we're, we're getting there.

830
00:47:26,191 --> 00:47:26,974
Okay.

831
00:47:27,018 --> 00:47:28,323
It's gonna take some time.

832
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:30,760
Is there anything

833
00:47:30,804 --> 00:47:33,938
that you feel like you
could do to help that,

834
00:47:33,981 --> 00:47:35,113
that time progress?

835
00:47:37,985 --> 00:47:38,985
Um...

836
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,513
I guess I would say patience,

837
00:47:46,472 --> 00:47:51,346
for me to have some patience
for them to come around,

838
00:47:51,781 --> 00:47:52,781
um...

839
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:59,485
and also maybe forgive myself.

840
00:48:49,665 --> 00:48:52,059
So you mean to tell
me, like, you were, well,

841
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:53,669
molested coming up?

842
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,284
That and my sister is
actually my mom.

843
00:49:02,852 --> 00:49:03,941
Wait, what?

844
00:49:05,986 --> 00:49:10,034
Yeah, Giselle told me
that she was raped

845
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:14,211
and my,

846
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:18,041
she's my mom.

847
00:49:18,346 --> 00:49:19,565
She's your mom?

848
00:49:19,608 --> 00:49:22,220
You just got this news, like,
recently or?

849
00:49:22,263 --> 00:49:25,832
Last week when uncle Will
brought us over to talk

850
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:29,009
and hash it out and...

851
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:32,926
That's pretty, that's
pretty crazy right there.

852
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,189
Tell me about it.

853
00:49:35,233 --> 00:49:36,514
I hope this doesn't
get in the way

854
00:49:36,538 --> 00:49:38,540
of you guys coming
together as a family

855
00:49:38,584 --> 00:49:42,240
and just trying to reconnect.

856
00:49:42,283 --> 00:49:43,483
Coming together as a family?

857
00:49:44,938 --> 00:49:48,463
I don't even know
what family is at this point.

858
00:49:48,507 --> 00:49:50,117
I don't even know who
my family is.

859
00:49:51,466 --> 00:49:53,512
But I mean, it's no
time for you to give up.

860
00:49:53,555 --> 00:49:54,861
I mean, it's, this
is a good time

861
00:49:54,904 --> 00:49:56,602
for you guys to come
back together.

862
00:49:57,951 --> 00:49:58,952
Now at this point,

863
00:50:00,693 --> 00:50:01,999
I don't even know how to feel.

864
00:50:03,609 --> 00:50:08,570
I, I don't have a relationship
like that with any of them.

865
00:50:11,486 --> 00:50:12,966
Diane's not actually my sister

866
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,447
and I don't even know what
she is to me at this point.

867
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:18,102
I mean, it's a good
time to figure it out.

868
00:50:18,145 --> 00:50:19,973
I mean, you gotta
start somewhere.

869
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:24,543
No, no, we did that last week.

870
00:50:25,935 --> 00:50:27,285
I'm just, I don't know,

871
00:50:28,634 --> 00:50:30,046
I'm just, not, not,
not gonna talk to them.

872
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:31,376
I don't have to.

873
00:50:31,419 --> 00:50:32,570
Look, well, it's a step
in the right direction.

874
00:50:32,594 --> 00:50:33,465
I know.

875
00:50:33,508 --> 00:50:34,335
I mean, it didn't go as planned.

876
00:50:34,379 --> 00:50:36,163
Forget the right direction!

877
00:50:37,686 --> 00:50:40,385
I pretty much grew up
with no mother!

878
00:50:40,428 --> 00:50:43,301
Well, technically, I didn't
even know who she was.

879
00:50:43,344 --> 00:50:44,867
What am I supposed to do
at this point?

880
00:50:44,911 --> 00:50:47,696
Start all over?

881
00:50:51,396 --> 00:50:52,396
You know,

882
00:50:55,182 --> 00:50:56,792
my sisters, they,

883
00:50:56,836 --> 00:50:58,794
my mom and my,

884
00:51:01,362 --> 00:51:03,234
they wanna go to therapy

885
00:51:03,277 --> 00:51:04,322
and work everything out.

886
00:51:04,365 --> 00:51:06,019
That's good, that's
a good thing!

887
00:51:07,629 --> 00:51:12,112
So, I guess in order to
get our family

888
00:51:12,156 --> 00:51:13,983
back on the right track,

889
00:51:14,027 --> 00:51:17,857
I guess I can go to this
one therapy session.

890
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,641
It's gotta start somewhere.

891
00:51:19,685 --> 00:51:22,427
One is better than none,
trust me.

892
00:51:23,297 --> 00:51:24,777
And I support you.

893
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:27,649
I can sit in the parking lot
and wait on you to come out.

894
00:51:31,523 --> 00:51:33,655
I love you.
I love you.

895
00:51:55,503 --> 00:51:57,636
So, hi, Ruth,
how are you doing today?

896
00:51:57,679 --> 00:51:58,376
I'm good.

897
00:51:58,419 --> 00:51:59,420
It's good to see you.

898
00:51:59,464 --> 00:52:00,615
It's good to see you too,
yeah.

899
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,990
Yes, so fill me in,
let me know, uh,

900
00:52:04,033 --> 00:52:05,098
why don't you tell me a
little bit more

901
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,601
about your, your personal life;

902
00:52:06,645 --> 00:52:07,733
how's that going?

903
00:52:07,776 --> 00:52:09,517
My personal life's
been going good.

904
00:52:09,561 --> 00:52:11,650
Yeah, I'm still with
my boyfriend.

905
00:52:11,693 --> 00:52:13,130
Good, okay.

906
00:52:13,173 --> 00:52:15,219
We've, we've gotten better.

907
00:52:15,262 --> 00:52:16,959
- Better?
- Yeah.

908
00:52:17,003 --> 00:52:18,831
Is there,
uh, anything in particular

909
00:52:18,874 --> 00:52:20,659
that you'd like to
discuss about then?

910
00:52:20,702 --> 00:52:21,702
Um...

911
00:52:24,184 --> 00:52:25,184
During the,

912
00:52:27,796 --> 00:52:30,799
during the thing with my
grandmother passing away,

913
00:52:33,193 --> 00:52:37,328
I kind of released my
stress in ways

914
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:41,070
that other people probably
wouldn't agree with.

915
00:52:41,114 --> 00:52:42,202
Such as?

916
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:48,730
Um, after night
club rendezvous?

917
00:52:50,428 --> 00:52:51,864
Okay.

918
00:52:51,907 --> 00:52:54,867
Uh, does your boyfriend
know about this?

919
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,173
No.

920
00:52:59,045 --> 00:53:01,047
What do you
think he would do if he knew?

921
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,050
Probably leave.

922
00:53:06,531 --> 00:53:08,315
And
how does that make you feel?

923
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,319
Hurt.

924
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,586
So why is it that, uh,

925
00:53:19,718 --> 00:53:21,372
why, why do you do these things?

926
00:53:24,766 --> 00:53:27,639
I didn't anyone to talk
to when I was growing up.

927
00:53:27,682 --> 00:53:29,945
You know?
Mhm.

928
00:53:29,989 --> 00:53:31,686
I didn't have a mother
that I can run to.

929
00:53:33,035 --> 00:53:35,473
I didn't have a sister
that I can confide in.

930
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:38,170
There, that was,

931
00:53:39,172 --> 00:53:41,783
that was the only thing
that I could do

932
00:53:41,827 --> 00:53:46,571
in order to forget what I was
going through for the moment.

933
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:51,401
Okay, okay.

934
00:53:53,012 --> 00:53:56,189
Well, I wanna say that
these individual sessions

935
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,886
are very beneficial.

936
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:01,716
However, it will be
very beneficial for you

937
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,805
and for your sisters if
you guys continue

938
00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:05,416
to come in together.

939
00:54:05,459 --> 00:54:08,245
So I'd, I'd like to set up a,
a time where we can get you

940
00:54:08,288 --> 00:54:10,116
all three in here together.

941
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:11,770
Uh, do you think
that's something

942
00:54:11,813 --> 00:54:13,772
that you'd be open to doing?

943
00:54:13,815 --> 00:54:14,642
Yeah.

944
00:54:14,686 --> 00:54:15,469
Yeah?

945
00:54:15,513 --> 00:54:16,296
Okay, good.

946
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,863
All right, well, um,

947
00:54:18,864 --> 00:54:21,867
let's put that together and, uh,

948
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:23,042
we'll be in touch.

949
00:54:23,085 --> 00:54:24,086
Okay.

950
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,174
- All right?
- All right.

951
00:54:25,218 --> 00:54:26,350
Have a good day, okay?

952
00:54:26,393 --> 00:54:27,742
- You too.
- Thank you!

953
00:54:39,885 --> 00:54:41,626
I'm so glad the
work day is over.

954
00:54:41,669 --> 00:54:44,933
- You and me both.
- God.

955
00:54:46,587 --> 00:54:47,632
Hello, Ruth.

956
00:54:47,675 --> 00:54:50,287
What the hell are
you doing here?

957
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,549
Who is this?

958
00:54:51,592 --> 00:54:53,420
What you
mean what I'm doing here?

959
00:54:53,464 --> 00:54:55,727
You haven't responded to
any of my texts,

960
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:56,771
none of my phone calls,

961
00:54:58,164 --> 00:54:59,924
and you deleted me off
all your social medias.

962
00:54:59,948 --> 00:55:01,428
What you think I'm doing here?

963
00:55:01,472 --> 00:55:03,865
You don't understand what
our arrangement was, do you?

964
00:55:03,909 --> 00:55:04,736
And you're beautiful.

965
00:55:04,779 --> 00:55:06,128
What you mean, what arrangement?

966
00:55:06,172 --> 00:55:07,782
It was a one-time thing!

967
00:55:07,826 --> 00:55:10,132
Of course I'm not gonna
call you and text you back.

968
00:55:10,176 --> 00:55:11,960
How did you find out
where I work at?

969
00:55:12,004 --> 00:55:13,222
What are you doing here?

970
00:55:13,266 --> 00:55:14,398
A one-time thing?

971
00:55:14,441 --> 00:55:15,636
Ruth, how could you do
me like that?

972
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:16,835
I love you.

973
00:55:16,878 --> 00:55:18,291
- You need to leave!
- Hey, you need to go!

974
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,751
Seriously.

975
00:55:19,794 --> 00:55:20,794
Goodbye.

976
00:55:22,841 --> 00:55:26,323
I'll see you later.

977
00:55:31,415 --> 00:55:32,503
I don't even...

978
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,551
How'd he even find out
where I work?

979
00:55:37,595 --> 00:55:41,207
Ruth, I know you got a
man and that wasn't him.

980
00:55:42,774 --> 00:55:43,905
What is going on?

981
00:55:46,081 --> 00:55:49,911
Seriously, it was
just a one-night stand.

982
00:55:49,955 --> 00:55:52,436
I didn't expect him to
pop up at my job.

983
00:55:52,479 --> 00:55:54,612
Like, who does stuff like that?

984
00:55:54,655 --> 00:55:55,743
That was crazy.

985
00:55:55,787 --> 00:55:57,397
That was intense.

986
00:55:58,311 --> 00:56:00,835
If this guy doesn't go away...

987
00:56:00,879 --> 00:56:02,576
Oh, he's gotta go away.

988
00:56:03,621 --> 00:56:04,621
Definitely.

989
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:07,102
So what made you do it?

990
00:56:10,323 --> 00:56:14,327
There's just so much
going on in my personal life

991
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,372
with my family.

992
00:56:15,415 --> 00:56:16,764
I just,

993
00:56:16,808 --> 00:56:18,549
I just needed to get
away from it all,

994
00:56:18,592 --> 00:56:21,552
just like, escape
reality for one day,

995
00:56:21,595 --> 00:56:24,206
and I didn't, I didn't expect it

996
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,383
to turn into anything like that.

997
00:56:27,732 --> 00:56:31,779
So what's going on,
you wanna talk about it?

998
00:56:35,957 --> 00:56:38,525
I just
found out that my sister

999
00:56:38,569 --> 00:56:40,048
is actually my mom.

1000
00:56:40,092 --> 00:56:42,442
And my other sister is
actually my aunt

1001
00:56:42,486 --> 00:56:45,663
and my grandma is not my
grandma either.

1002
00:56:46,794 --> 00:56:48,100
It's just a lot.

1003
00:56:48,143 --> 00:56:49,754
It's a lot to process

1004
00:56:49,797 --> 00:56:52,974
and I'm just,

1005
00:56:53,018 --> 00:56:55,213
I don't even know how to handle
everything at this moment.

1006
00:56:55,237 --> 00:56:56,238
I really don't.

1007
00:56:58,197 --> 00:57:00,547
That is a lot to handle.

1008
00:57:00,591 --> 00:57:01,679
Tell me about it.

1009
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:06,205
But I don't
wanna mess anything up

1010
00:57:06,248 --> 00:57:07,248
on my boyfriend.

1011
00:57:09,034 --> 00:57:11,123
I don't wanna hurt him,
he's a really good guy.

1012
00:57:12,516 --> 00:57:14,605
I just hope whatever
happened today

1013
00:57:14,648 --> 00:57:16,737
just doesn't spiral
out of control.

1014
00:57:18,783 --> 00:57:20,480
I hope not.

1015
00:57:20,524 --> 00:57:22,351
Have you thought about
seeing anybody?

1016
00:57:24,702 --> 00:57:26,573
Yeah, my sisters are talking

1017
00:57:26,617 --> 00:57:30,882
about seeing a therapist or
something, but I don't know.

1018
00:57:30,925 --> 00:57:33,014
That therapy shit, it
rarely works.

1019
00:57:36,148 --> 00:57:37,454
Well, you can talk to me.

1020
00:57:40,631 --> 00:57:44,286
Honestly, I'm just ready
for all of this to be over.

1021
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,616
Hey, honey, what's up?

1022
00:58:55,183 --> 00:58:56,881
Yeah, what time?

1023
00:58:58,665 --> 00:59:01,407
Okay, well, I just have
one more set of clients,

1024
00:59:02,234 --> 00:59:03,104
the Williams sisters,

1025
00:59:03,148 --> 00:59:04,628
and then I can meet you there.

1026
00:59:06,978 --> 00:59:08,109
Okay.

1027
00:59:08,153 --> 00:59:09,546
All right, see you soon, bye.

1028
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,554
Okay.

1029
00:59:21,166 --> 00:59:22,166
All right.

1030
00:59:30,305 --> 00:59:32,394
Hi, ladies, I'm Dr. Roberts.

1031
00:59:32,438 --> 00:59:34,614
Thank you for coming in today.

1032
00:59:34,658 --> 00:59:37,704
Would anyone like to discuss
what brought you here today?

1033
00:59:43,188 --> 00:59:44,188
Um...

1034
00:59:47,192 --> 00:59:50,674
Well, I guess, um,

1035
00:59:52,414 --> 00:59:57,376
for me, um, I would like to
build better relationships

1036
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:05,427
with my sister and, um,
my daughter,

1037
01:00:08,387 --> 01:00:13,348
but I feel like I'm blamed for
a lot of the things that have

1038
01:00:16,743 --> 01:00:20,094
transpired in our family,

1039
01:00:20,138 --> 01:00:23,750
and, um, I don't
think that's fair.

1040
01:00:23,794 --> 01:00:25,186
- Okay.
- I wanna be forgiven.

1041
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:26,424
- What do you mean?
- Be serious.

1042
01:00:26,448 --> 01:00:27,536
Are you kidding me?

1043
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:29,060
Come on now.

1044
01:00:29,103 --> 01:00:34,152
Like, you just
dropped a bomb on us

1045
01:00:34,195 --> 01:00:35,719
a couple weeks ago.

1046
01:00:35,762 --> 01:00:38,809
Okay, but it wasn't
just my bomb.

1047
01:00:38,852 --> 01:00:41,072
I didn't create the bomb.

1048
01:00:42,247 --> 01:00:44,292
Well, she led into it.

1049
01:00:44,336 --> 01:00:46,251
She might as well say it.

1050
01:00:46,294 --> 01:00:47,818
You know what, Diane?

1051
01:00:47,861 --> 01:00:50,777
If your attitude is not
gonna be positive,

1052
01:00:50,821 --> 01:00:52,300
then maybe you
should think twice

1053
01:00:52,344 --> 01:00:53,127
about being here.
Are you gonna tell her

1054
01:00:53,171 --> 01:00:54,302
the story or what?

1055
01:00:55,173 --> 01:00:59,656
Anyway, so our mother

1056
01:01:00,787 --> 01:01:03,485
made a decision when
I was younger

1057
01:01:03,529 --> 01:01:04,835
when I got pregnant...

1058
01:01:09,491 --> 01:01:12,146
To hide me and to pretend...

1059
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:16,324
It wasn't to hide you
or to pretend anything.

1060
01:01:18,152 --> 01:01:21,982
She made a decision that
she felt was, was best.

1061
01:01:22,026 --> 01:01:25,986
She made a decision that she
felt would protect us all.

1062
01:01:27,161 --> 01:01:29,903
And I'm not saying that I
agree with it,

1063
01:01:29,947 --> 01:01:32,471
but I don't think I should
be blamed for it either.

1064
01:01:34,516 --> 01:01:36,146
I don't, I don't blame
you for anything.

1065
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:40,784
It's just, this is just
a hell of a confession.

1066
01:01:41,828 --> 01:01:43,395
It's no wonder why me and her,

1067
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,354
we don't mix.

1068
01:01:46,398 --> 01:01:48,008
It's like oil and water

1069
01:01:48,052 --> 01:01:50,010
'cause she's my niece.

1070
01:01:50,054 --> 01:01:52,926
Anyway, um...

1071
01:01:56,190 --> 01:02:00,238
I was 13 when I got
pregnant with her

1072
01:02:01,413 --> 01:02:05,983
and I didn't know how to
deal with that.

1073
01:02:06,026 --> 01:02:08,637
I didn't know what to do.

1074
01:02:08,681 --> 01:02:13,642
So when mom decided to
send me away to have her,

1075
01:02:14,469 --> 01:02:16,384
I trusted that she,

1076
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:19,953
she was doing what she
felt was best.

1077
01:02:21,912 --> 01:02:25,742
Had I known that it would
cause such a, a, a rift

1078
01:02:27,569 --> 01:02:30,268
and bring us here to
this place today,

1079
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:34,751
then maybe, I don't know,

1080
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:37,144
maybe things could have
been different.

1081
01:02:37,188 --> 01:02:41,540
But I always felt like Diane
has had this unnecessary

1082
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:43,300
animosity against me.
Don't even play me, girl.

1083
01:02:43,324 --> 01:02:45,370
For something that I didn't
have any control over.

1084
01:02:45,413 --> 01:02:48,329
You know damn well why
I felt the way I felt.

1085
01:02:48,373 --> 01:02:50,984
And I told you that when we
were at uncle William's house.

1086
01:02:51,028 --> 01:02:53,813
You know why, you know why.

1087
01:02:53,857 --> 01:02:56,642
The one person that I trusted

1088
01:02:56,685 --> 01:02:59,036
to tell something that
happened to me

1089
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:01,603
just basically just disowned me.

1090
01:03:01,647 --> 01:03:03,214
And then that's what
I felt like.

1091
01:03:04,041 --> 01:03:05,520
Okay.

1092
01:03:05,564 --> 01:03:10,221
Okay, but now you know I
did not, I did not disown you.

1093
01:03:10,917 --> 01:03:12,876
I know that now.

1094
01:03:12,919 --> 01:03:14,984
Yeah, but you were stupid
enough to go down to the studio

1095
01:03:15,008 --> 01:03:15,835
after she told you not to do it.

1096
01:03:15,879 --> 01:03:16,836
I'm not even talking to you

1097
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,272
and I'm still not
talking to you.

1098
01:03:18,316 --> 01:03:19,796
This has nothing to do with you.

1099
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,101
Okay, this is exactly why

1100
01:03:21,145 --> 01:03:22,862
I didn't want to come
here in the first place.

1101
01:03:22,886 --> 01:03:23,906
I'm talking to her.
Then you could

1102
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:24,975
have stayed home.

1103
01:03:25,018 --> 01:03:25,714
Okay, okay, okay, let's,
ladies.

1104
01:03:25,758 --> 01:03:26,759
Nobody forced you here.

1105
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:30,328
Let's, let's bring
it back to us,

1106
01:03:30,371 --> 01:03:33,418
the understanding of the
friction in your relationship,

1107
01:03:33,461 --> 01:03:35,028
in this family.

1108
01:03:35,072 --> 01:03:40,033
So how did you feel having to
go with your mother's decision

1109
01:03:43,384 --> 01:03:46,561
of saying that that was
Ruth was your sister,

1110
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:52,089
instead of saying the
truth, I guess, you know?

1111
01:04:00,488 --> 01:04:02,490
I remember feeling empty.

1112
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:14,981
I remember feeling powerless,
like,

1113
01:04:19,638 --> 01:04:22,641
but at the same time I
remember feeling

1114
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:32,346
cared for, if that
makes any sense?

1115
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:33,739
It's confusing.

1116
01:04:33,782 --> 01:04:34,782
Okay.

1117
01:04:36,742 --> 01:04:40,093
Uh, Ruth, did you have
anything you might want

1118
01:04:40,137 --> 01:04:41,181
to add about?

1119
01:04:41,225 --> 01:04:43,009
How did you feel about
the situation?

1120
01:04:46,099 --> 01:04:47,099
Confused.

1121
01:04:48,275 --> 01:04:49,275
Angry.

1122
01:04:51,452 --> 01:04:55,456
Um, I don't know.

1123
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:58,938
I just, I'm still
wrapping my head

1124
01:04:58,982 --> 01:05:00,262
around everything that happened.

1125
01:05:01,636 --> 01:05:05,379
It's not something that a
blink of an eye

1126
01:05:05,423 --> 01:05:08,165
you can just be like, "Oh,
okay, this is my mother.

1127
01:05:08,208 --> 01:05:09,446
"I have a relationship with her.

1128
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:12,386
"And this is my aunt."
Of course.

1129
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:13,213
"We're gonna get along fine."

1130
01:05:13,257 --> 01:05:14,736
We still don't.

1131
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:15,650
Of course.

1132
01:05:15,694 --> 01:05:16,869
Well, it's only natural.

1133
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,436
I mean, of course it
would take time

1134
01:05:18,479 --> 01:05:22,048
for you guys to have to
build a, a relationship.

1135
01:05:22,092 --> 01:05:23,920
You know, this is all
new information,

1136
01:05:25,138 --> 01:05:27,271
except for, for you, of course.

1137
01:05:28,359 --> 01:05:29,751
So.

1138
01:05:29,795 --> 01:05:32,232
Well, I wanna know, like,

1139
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:36,236
now that the truth is out,

1140
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,456
now that you know why,

1141
01:05:42,329 --> 01:05:43,678
why are you still angry?

1142
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:48,945
I'm not angry.

1143
01:05:48,988 --> 01:05:51,338
It's just, it's, it's
hard to process.

1144
01:05:51,382 --> 01:05:54,385
That's just not something
that when you,

1145
01:05:54,428 --> 01:05:57,562
when you find out the reasons
behind some of the actions

1146
01:05:57,605 --> 01:05:59,346
that were put forth,

1147
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:00,889
it's just not something
overnight you could say,

1148
01:06:00,913 --> 01:06:02,523
"Oh, okay, this is
what happened.

1149
01:06:02,567 --> 01:06:04,066
"I'll go ahead and
adjust my life to that."

1150
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:06,310
That's just not how it works.

1151
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:10,053
This happened, what,
like a week ago?

1152
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:17,408
That's just, all of the events
that transpired up to this,

1153
01:06:17,451 --> 01:06:18,451
it's just, it's,

1154
01:06:20,846 --> 01:06:23,109
it's just a lot to just
take in and just.

1155
01:06:24,502 --> 01:06:26,504
Okay, well, why don't
you tell me more

1156
01:06:26,547 --> 01:06:28,462
about the events
that transpired?

1157
01:06:34,207 --> 01:06:35,730
How my niece came about.

1158
01:06:37,906 --> 01:06:42,302
I mean, I know that our
household wasn't perfect.

1159
01:06:44,696 --> 01:06:46,785
We were dysfunctional as hell.

1160
01:06:46,828 --> 01:06:48,700
I mean, the things that
we had to see.

1161
01:06:51,137 --> 01:06:52,834
Oh, for God's sake, Diane,
just say it.

1162
01:06:52,878 --> 01:06:54,619
Our father was a fucking rapist.

1163
01:06:54,662 --> 01:06:55,794
Oh, okay, there you go.

1164
01:06:55,837 --> 01:06:56,837
There it is.

1165
01:06:58,144 --> 01:07:00,581
But like I said, that's not
anything that you just get over

1166
01:07:00,625 --> 01:07:02,061
and move on with your
life with it,

1167
01:07:02,105 --> 01:07:05,543
especially if you don't see
things like that happening

1168
01:07:05,586 --> 01:07:08,024
until somebody just takes
the pin out and just

1169
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:08,981
throws the bomb and it
automatically entails

1170
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,417
everything,

1171
01:07:10,461 --> 01:07:12,593
and then you expect everything
to be okay after that?

1172
01:07:12,637 --> 01:07:13,942
Well, how...

1173
01:07:13,986 --> 01:07:15,529
We supposed to be all
peanut butter and jelly

1174
01:07:15,553 --> 01:07:17,990
and holding hands and skipping
down the street after that?

1175
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,166
- Not peanut butter and jelly.
- Be real.

1176
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:21,428
I am being real.

1177
01:07:21,472 --> 01:07:23,300
How did you expect for
this shit to come out?

1178
01:07:24,649 --> 01:07:27,434
Did, did, did you expect
a bouquet of flowers?

1179
01:07:27,478 --> 01:07:28,783
Really, that's not cool.

1180
01:07:28,827 --> 01:07:30,350
You've been very
quiet for a while.

1181
01:07:30,394 --> 01:07:32,352
Why don't you tell me
how do you feel

1182
01:07:32,396 --> 01:07:36,748
knowing that your grandfather
was actually your dad?

1183
01:07:41,666 --> 01:07:46,627
I don't even wanna think or
talk about that man, honestly.

1184
01:07:49,891 --> 01:07:52,851
But I do know that
my grandmother

1185
01:07:55,332 --> 01:07:58,465
would hate for us to
be like this,

1186
01:07:59,771 --> 01:08:01,512
especially after
everything that's happened.

1187
01:08:02,861 --> 01:08:07,213
And I know that I haven't
always been

1188
01:08:08,606 --> 01:08:13,437
the one that is the most
talkative or easygoing,

1189
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:18,442
and I've given both of
you, like, a lot of crap,

1190
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:25,057
but uncle Will brought
us here together

1191
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:28,930
and it was for my grandmother.

1192
01:08:32,456 --> 01:08:35,241
So if we're not gonna
fix it today,

1193
01:08:36,982 --> 01:08:39,593
sooner or later something
has to happen.

1194
01:08:50,474 --> 01:08:52,171
I just wanted to be forgiven.

1195
01:08:57,524 --> 01:09:01,311
I think, I think I
could definitely do that.

1196
01:09:03,922 --> 01:09:06,359
Good, we're making progress.

1197
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:10,015
How about you, Giselle?

1198
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:14,367
I, I love my, my sister,
I always have.

1199
01:09:16,108 --> 01:09:18,719
Didn't really have, like, a
close relationship with my mom

1200
01:09:18,763 --> 01:09:21,331
like her and my mom did,
you know?

1201
01:09:21,374 --> 01:09:22,636
So I always looked up to her,

1202
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:25,770
I always went up to her,
always confided in her.

1203
01:09:25,813 --> 01:09:28,338
I just think that one hiccup,

1204
01:09:28,381 --> 01:09:32,994
it, it, it hurt me just
to, to get her reaction.

1205
01:09:33,734 --> 01:09:36,084
But now that I know why.

1206
01:09:36,128 --> 01:09:37,173
I love my sister to death,

1207
01:09:37,216 --> 01:09:39,566
I was just so damn angry at her

1208
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:43,918
because for a while I didn't
know why she did what she did,

1209
01:09:45,224 --> 01:09:47,922
why she reacted towards
me the way she did.

1210
01:09:47,966 --> 01:09:51,578
So for a long time, I, I
internalized it

1211
01:09:53,014 --> 01:09:57,976
and I took it into my, my
relationship, you know?

1212
01:10:00,326 --> 01:10:02,633
And I love her to death
and I love her,

1213
01:10:03,982 --> 01:10:05,201
but that's not gonna change.

1214
01:10:05,244 --> 01:10:06,593
I was just hurt.

1215
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:09,466
And I love my niece.

1216
01:10:11,163 --> 01:10:14,862
I mean, granted, our
relationship was non-existent.

1217
01:10:14,906 --> 01:10:19,824
We were passing in the house,
not even acknowledging,

1218
01:10:19,867 --> 01:10:21,695
and I will take the fall
for most of that

1219
01:10:23,088 --> 01:10:26,004
because it wasn't her
fault how she got here.

1220
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,527
And I didn't know at the time,

1221
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,357
but I always loved her.

1222
01:10:32,837 --> 01:10:33,925
I didn't show it.

1223
01:10:35,056 --> 01:10:36,101
I didn't show it.

1224
01:10:43,326 --> 01:10:46,154
I'm sorry.

1225
01:10:47,939 --> 01:10:48,896
I'm sorry.

1226
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:50,158
I'm sorry too.

1227
01:10:54,075 --> 01:10:56,077
I should've told you
about it sooner.

1228
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:02,867
I mean, it wasn't
really your fault, Giselle.

1229
01:11:05,435 --> 01:11:08,394
But I know why you
did what you did,

1230
01:11:08,438 --> 01:11:09,526
and I thank you for that,

1231
01:11:09,569 --> 01:11:10,938
because for a long
time I thought it

1232
01:11:10,962 --> 01:11:12,485
was just swept under the rug.

1233
01:11:15,532 --> 01:11:16,315
The length that you would go

1234
01:11:16,359 --> 01:11:17,577
to protect your family

1235
01:11:17,621 --> 01:11:20,232
even though we didn't
see what was going on.

1236
01:11:21,451 --> 01:11:22,451
Thank you.

1237
01:11:23,322 --> 01:11:24,322
Thank you.

1238
01:13:05,468 --> 01:13:09,210
This is the first time
I've hugged my mother.

1239
01:13:12,736 --> 01:13:16,957
Ooh.
