00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:42,057
A STAGED ARREST
FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION

369
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:43,217

370
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:46,641

TO DECIDE.

A SUCCESS?

380
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:28,192
IT'S A DEAL.

381
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,198
WHEN THE NECK IS BROKEN,
THERE'S ONLY A SHARP PAIN, FAST.

382
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,201

IT TAKES YOU THERE
TO THE OTHER SIDE.

385

SO DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH.

386

WHEN YOU DIE, YOU'RE GONNA SEE
THE SPIRIT HORSE.

387

PARDON BILLY THE KID!
IMPOSSIBLE!

00:24:18,606 --> 00:24:21,609
I SHOULD HAVE DUSTED
HIS EXCELLENCY'S REGAL ASS

WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

HE DIDN'T EXACTLY
LIE TO ME.

ANOTHER HISTORICAL
AND BIOLOGICAL FACT

454
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,208
WAS THAT
I HAD SMALL HANDS

455
00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:55,768

721
00:37:19,955 --> 00:37:21,956
YOU EVER SHOOT
ANYBODY BEFORE,

722
00:37:21,957 --> 00:37:23,150
HENDRY WILLIAM
FRENCH?

723
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,161
YOU EVER SHOOT
ANYTHING BEFORE?

724
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,163
SAGE HEN.

725
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:32,098
SAGE HEN!

726
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:35,033
AHH...

727
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,158
WELL, TELL ME
SOMETHING, HENDRY.

728
00:37:37,037 --> 00:37:40,174
WHY IS IT YOU WANNA
JOIN MY GANG, HUH?

729
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,041
WELL, I AIN'T--

730
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:45,062
I AIN'T A FARMER
NO MORE.

731
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:47,623
UH...LOST MY WIFE
TO THE POX,

732
00:37:47,624 --> 00:37:50,184
LOST MY LAND
TO THE MONEY MEN.

733
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,085
HEY, BIG CASINO...

734
00:37:52,086 --> 00:37:54,187
WHY DON'T YOU SAW A FOOT
OFF OF THIS THING

735
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:57,123
IN CASE WE RUN INTO
GOVERNOR WALLACE ON THE WAY.

736
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:05,087
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA
MAKE THIS ONE, KID.

737
00:38:10,137 --> 00:38:12,105
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

738
00:38:12,106 --> 00:38:14,124
YOU GOTTA COME WITH US, PAT.

739
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,142
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO,

740
00:38:16,143 --> 00:38:18,144
STAY HERE
AND SCRUB POTS FOR BEEVER?

741
00:38:18,145 --> 00:38:20,147
I MAY HAVE OLD BEEVER
SCRUB THE POTS FOR ME.

742
00:38:20,148 --> 00:38:21,147
I'M BUYING THIS PLACE,

743
00:38:21,148 --> 00:38:23,149
TURNING IT
INTO AN EATING HOUSE.

744
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,152
THERE'S WILDCAT MONEY
COMING IN HERE.

745
00:38:25,153 --> 00:38:27,153
I GOT TO STAKE MY PIECE

746
00:38:27,154 --> 00:38:29,156
WHILE I STILL GOT
A FAIR ENOUGH NAME.

747
00:38:29,157 --> 00:38:30,156
WHAT NAME?

748
00:38:30,157 --> 00:38:32,158
YOU'D BE RIDING
WITH KNOWN MEN, PATSY.

749
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:35,162
YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO BE
A KNOWN MAN IN NEW MEXICO.

750
00:38:35,163 --> 00:38:37,163
HELL,
I'LL BE A KNOWN MAN.

751
00:38:37,164 --> 00:38:38,659
NEXT TIME
YOU RIDE THROUGH HERE,

752
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,155
THERE'LL BE
A BIG OLD SIGN OUT THERE

753
00:38:41,168 --> 00:38:42,169
SAYS "GARRETT'S PLACE."

754
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,169
IT'S TIME
I GOT AN INCOME

755
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,671
THAT AIN'T
FROM STEALING HORSES.

756
00:38:44,672 --> 00:38:46,172
WELL, YOU REMEMBER
SOMETHING, PAT.

757
00:38:46,173 --> 00:38:48,175
I NEVER STOLE A HORSE
FROM SOMEONE I DIDN'T LIKE.

758
00:38:48,176 --> 00:38:50,176
IF I DIDN'T LIKE THEM,

759
00:38:50,177 --> 00:38:52,179
I JUST WOULDN'T
EVEN BOTHER WITH THEM.

760
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,170
NO. HE'D JUST KILL THEM.

761
00:38:57,184 --> 00:38:59,186
HEY, COME ON, PAT!
YOU'RE ONE OF US!

762
00:38:59,187 --> 00:39:02,121
YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN ONE OF US!

763
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:06,115
I ALWAYS WILL BE, BILLY.

764
00:39:11,131 --> 00:39:12,120
WELL, GO ON, THEN!

765
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:16,125
GO ON!
WE DON'T NEED YOU, PAT!

766
00:39:18,138 --> 00:39:20,129
WE DON'T NEED HIM.

767
00:39:28,148 --> 00:39:29,148
AH!

768
00:39:29,149 --> 00:39:31,150
SOAPWEED, I GOT YOU!

769
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:33,153
YOU WANT TO EAT
OUT OF MY ASHCANS?

770
00:39:33,154 --> 00:39:35,144
GO ON. HAVE A CHEW!

771
00:39:37,157 --> 00:39:39,148
GO ON! GO ON!

772
00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:44,153
HOWDY, BEEVER.

773
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:49,169
GO ON.
SIT WITH THE BOYS.

774
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,171
WHAT THE HELL'S THIS?

775
00:39:51,172 --> 00:39:52,171
THIS?

776
00:39:52,172 --> 00:39:56,165
THIS IS THE PRINCE
OF PENNSYLVANIA.

777
00:40:04,184 --> 00:40:06,175
MMM, MMM, MMM.

778
00:40:07,187 --> 00:40:09,183
[SIGHS]

779
00:40:09,184 --> 00:40:11,180
[CLANGING]

780
00:40:14,461 --> 00:40:17,197
THE FIRST STOP
ALONG THE BLACKBIRD

781
00:40:17,198 --> 00:40:19,350
WAS TO RAISE SOMEDINEROS,

782
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:21,501
AND JOHN SIMPSUM CHISUM

783
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:25,199
WAS THE RICHEST MAN
IN THE TERRITORY.

784
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,530
NOT ONLY THAT,

785
00:40:27,207 --> 00:40:29,876
BUT AS ANYONE FAMILIAR
WITH THE LINCOLN WAR KNOWS,

786
00:40:29,877 --> 00:40:32,546
HE WAS A FINANCIAL PARTNER
OF TUNSTALL AND McSWEEN,

787
00:40:32,547 --> 00:40:35,208
WHICH MADE HIM AN ALLY.

788
00:40:41,221 --> 00:40:43,222
OLD JOHN
ADMIRED MY PLUCK

789
00:40:43,223 --> 00:40:46,215
AND LOVED ME
LIKE I WAS HIS OWN SON.

790
00:40:46,627 --> 00:40:48,628
WELL, BY GOD.

791
00:40:48,629 --> 00:40:51,231
YOU REALLY TURNED OUT
TO BE A SNAKE, BILLY.

792
00:40:51,232 --> 00:40:52,632
WHEN THEY CATCH YOU,

793
00:40:52,633 --> 00:40:54,935
THEY'RE GONNA DRY GULCH
YOUR STINKING BONES.

794
00:40:54,936 --> 00:40:57,237
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET
MY FRIENDS TO OLD MEXICO.

795
00:40:57,238 --> 00:40:58,671
WE NEED SOME PESOS.

796
00:40:58,672 --> 00:41:00,606
NOW, I'VE DONE
SOME FIGURING,

797
00:41:00,607 --> 00:41:03,393
AND I FIGURE YOU OWE US,
MR. CHISUM--

798
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:06,021
$25O FOR THE FIGHTING
WE DID LAST YEAR

799
00:41:06,022 --> 00:41:08,649
AND $25O FOR ME
LEAVING YOUR STOCK ALONE.

800
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:10,650
IS THAT
WHAT YOU FIGURED?

801
00:41:10,651 --> 00:41:12,653
YES, SIR.
THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED.

802
00:41:12,654 --> 00:41:14,654
WELL, YOU CAN TAKE
THOSE FIGURES

803
00:41:14,655 --> 00:41:16,690
AND SHOVE THEM UP
YOUR ARROGANT LITTLE ASS

804
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:18,191
AND SET FIRE TO THEM.

805
00:41:18,192 --> 00:41:20,194
I DON'T OWE YOU
A GOD DAMN THING.

806
00:41:20,195 --> 00:41:22,195
NOW GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE!

807
00:41:22,196 --> 00:41:25,199
I'LL BRING MY .5O DOWN
AND GIVE YOU A REAL GAME.

808
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,734
YEAH. WE, UH, WE SAW
SOME OF YOUR MEN

809
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,735
UP THERE
ON THE HIGH RANGE.

810
00:41:29,736 --> 00:41:31,727
PASSED RIGHT BY THEM.
FINE BUNCH.

811
00:41:33,207 --> 00:41:34,708
MR. CHISUM...

812
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:36,209
YOU'RE RIGHT.

813
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:38,212
THE LINCOLN COUNTY WAR
IS OVER.

814
00:41:38,213 --> 00:41:40,214
WE JUST WANT TO
GET OUT OF HERE,

815
00:41:40,215 --> 00:41:41,203
GET DOWN BELOW.

816
00:41:41,782 --> 00:41:44,216
OH, YOU'LL GET DOWN BELOW
ALL RIGHT, DOC.

817
00:41:44,785 --> 00:41:46,219
YOU'LL GET DOWN BELOW.

818
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:49,723
YOU'RE BILLY THE KID,
TOO, YOU KNOW.

819
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:53,227
YOU ALL ARE
DIRTY LITTLE BILLY BASTARDS,

820
00:41:53,228 --> 00:41:57,231
AND I DON'T OWE YOU
ANYTHING, DOC.

821
00:41:57,232 --> 00:41:58,865
OR YOU, CHAVEZ...

822
00:41:58,866 --> 00:42:01,801
YOU TOOK MY FARM,
MR. CHISUM.

823
00:42:04,171 --> 00:42:07,173
YOU TOOK A LOT OF FARMS,
MR. CHISUM.

824
00:42:07,174 --> 00:42:09,843
AS LONG AS BILLY THE KID
IS TAKING SOME BACK,

825
00:42:09,844 --> 00:42:11,174
I'M WITH HIM.

826
00:42:11,845 --> 00:42:14,848
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT,
MR. CHISUM?

827
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:17,368
YES, YES.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

828
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:19,623
UH...GO ON AND BRING
THE MEN IN,

829
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:21,878
AND WE'LL HAVE
A LITTLE FRESH COFFEE

830
00:42:22,189 --> 00:42:23,891
WITH THE BOYS HERE.

831
00:42:23,892 --> 00:42:25,191
YOO-HOO!

832
00:42:25,192 --> 00:42:27,927
I'LL MAKE YOU FAMOUS.

833
00:42:27,928 --> 00:42:29,930
MR. CHISUM, WHICH ONE
OF THESE BOYS

834
00:42:29,931 --> 00:42:31,198
IS THE FASTEST
WITH THE IRON?

835
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:32,927
DON'T YOU DO IT,
BILLY.

836
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,202
THAT BE ME.

837
00:42:35,203 --> 00:42:37,203
YOU.

838
00:42:37,204 --> 00:42:38,972
DROP SAM COLT.

839
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,206
BILLY...

840
00:42:40,207 --> 00:42:41,970
PUT HER DOWN NOW.

841
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,973
STEP AWAY.

842
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:54,220
YOU OWE ME $5OO,
MR. CHISUM,

843
00:42:54,221 --> 00:42:58,225
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
IS KILL ONE OF YOUR MEN

844
00:42:58,226 --> 00:43:00,694
FOR EVERY $5.OO YOU OWE ME.

845
00:43:00,695 --> 00:43:03,162
ONLY I'M GOING TO
DO IT FAIR.

846
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,166
HOW'S THAT FOR SQUARE?

847
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:19,079
NOW, WHEN I GO FOR MY GUN,

848
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,179
YOU START SHOOTING.

849
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:24,082
BUT I PROMISE YOU,
YOU WILL NOT MAKE IT.

850
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,187
READY?

851
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:31,123
YEAH, I'M READY.

852
00:43:33,126 --> 00:43:34,184
DAVE.

853
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,200
OH, MY GOD!

854
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:42,191
495.

855
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,195
HENDRY.

856
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,204
OH, MY GOD!

857
00:43:50,205 --> 00:43:52,201
HENDRY.

858
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,219
49O.

859
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,154
YOU JUST KILLED YOURSELF.

860
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:08,160
BONNEY, YOU ARE A FOOL!

861
00:44:08,161 --> 00:44:12,165
YOU CALL YOURSELF
THE SCOURGE OF NEW MEXICO?

862
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:16,169
WELL, BY GOD,
IAMNEW MEXICO,

863
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:19,172
AND YOU ARE DEAD.

864
00:44:19,173 --> 00:44:21,173
HA HA!

865
00:44:21,174 --> 00:44:23,176
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
MR. NEW MEXICO.

866
00:44:23,177 --> 00:44:25,178
I WOULDN'T GIVE
A BUCKET OF PISS

867
00:44:25,179 --> 00:44:27,169
FOR YOUR FUTURE.

868
00:44:29,182 --> 00:44:30,182
SKIN OUT, BOYS.

869
00:44:30,183 --> 00:44:33,175
YOU HAVE YOURSELF
A GOOD DAY NOW.

870
00:44:41,194 --> 00:44:42,261
I WANT HIM DEAD.

871
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:44,264
WELL, THE PROBLEM IS
HE'S PROTECTED

872
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,266
BY THE SURROUNDING
COMMUNITIES.

873
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,200
THEY'VE
MADE A BLOODY HERO

874
00:44:48,201 --> 00:44:50,203
OUT OF A HALF-WIT
COMMON HORSE THIEF.

875
00:44:50,204 --> 00:44:51,295
THAT'S WHAT I SAY!

876
00:44:52,305 --> 00:44:56,309
LET'S HIRE A THIEF
TO CATCH ONE.

877
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:59,212
NOW BRING HIM IN,
GOVERNOR,

878
00:44:59,213 --> 00:45:00,270
AND MAKE THE OFFER.

879
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:05,149
PENDLETON.

880
00:45:29,376 --> 00:45:31,411
IF I'VE BEEN BROUGHT HERE
TO BE, UH...

881
00:45:31,412 --> 00:45:33,179
IMPLICATED IN ANYTHING,

882
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,182
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M A FAMILY MAN,

883
00:45:35,183 --> 00:45:37,416
FIXING TO SETTLE
AND RUN A BUSINESS.

884
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:40,181
MR. CHISUM HAS INFORMED US
OF YOUR AMBITIONS,

885
00:45:40,454 --> 00:45:41,454
MR. GARRETT.

886
00:45:41,455 --> 00:45:44,191
NOW, WE KNOW THAT YOU'VE
BEEN WITH BILLY BONNEY

887
00:45:44,192 --> 00:45:46,694
SEVERAL TIMES
WHEN HE CUT MY HERD.

888
00:45:46,695 --> 00:45:49,096
NOW, PAT,
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY

892
00:45:57,205 --> 00:46:00,206
YOU SEE, PATRICK...

893
00:46:00,207 --> 00:46:02,476
CERTAIN CHANGES
NEED TO BE STRUCTURED.

894
00:46:02,477 --> 00:46:04,143
WE NEED A SHERIFF

895
00:46:04,144 --> 00:46:06,146
WHO CAN ELIMINATE

00:46:06,147 --> 00:46:07,477
PROBLEM.

897
00:46:09,483 --> 00:46:12,319
I DON'T QUITE FOLLOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

898
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,155
WE'RE SAYING
SHERIFF OF LINCOLN COUNTY.

899
00:46:15,156 --> 00:46:17,156
SHERIFF PAT GARRETT.

900
00:46:17,157 --> 00:46:20,560

TO CARRY OUT
THE EXTERMINATION

907
00:46:36,611 --> 00:46:39,613
OF ONE
WILLIAM H. BONNEY.

908
00:46:39,614 --> 00:46:43,174
IS THAT SATISFACTORY?

909
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:52,191
WHILE PAT WAS THINKING

910
00:46:52,192 --> 00:46:55,194
ABOUT THE SANTA FE RING'S
GENEROUS OFFER,

911
00:46:55,195 --> 00:46:58,164
ME AND THE BOYS WERE BUSY
SORTING OUT OUR FINANCES.

912
00:46:58,165 --> 00:47:01,134
WE FIGURED THAT IF IT WAS
TOO MUCH OF A HARDSHIP

913
00:47:01,135 --> 00:47:03,136
FOR CHISUM
TO GIVE US ANY MONEY...

914
00:47:03,137 --> 00:47:05,137
HOWDY.

915
00:47:05,138 --> 00:47:07,140
WELL,
THEN WE'D HELP HIM OUT

916
00:47:07,141 --> 00:47:09,643
AND JUST TAKE
A FEW OF HIS COWS.

917
00:47:09,644 --> 00:47:12,145
I GUESS WHAT
I'M TRYING TO SAY IS,

918
00:47:12,146 --> 00:47:13,145
YOU'RE CALLED KID,

919
00:47:13,146 --> 00:47:15,148
AND RUDABAUGH'S
CALLED ARKANSAS DAVE,

920
00:47:15,149 --> 00:47:17,149
AND, UH, I DARESAY

921
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:19,152
DOC'S CHRISTIAN NAME
AIN'T DOC.

922
00:47:19,153 --> 00:47:21,153
YOU WANT A NAME.

923
00:47:21,154 --> 00:47:23,155
YES, SIR.
I WOULD LIKE THAT.

924
00:47:23,156 --> 00:47:26,159
I WOULD LIKE THAT
VERY MUCH INDEED.

925
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,160
YOU HAVE TO EARN IT,
HENDRY.

926
00:47:28,161 --> 00:47:31,164
UNTIL THEN, YOU'RE STUCK
WITH PLAIN OLD HENDRY.

927
00:47:31,165 --> 00:47:32,222
SORRY.

928
00:47:34,167 --> 00:47:35,225
[RINGING]

929
00:47:58,191 --> 00:47:59,351
[CLICK]

930
00:48:17,143 --> 00:48:19,379
STILL TRYING TO GET
THIS RAG SHEET

931
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,146
OFF THE GROUND, ASH?

932
00:48:21,147 --> 00:48:24,383
THE COPY IS GOOD.
THE MACHINE IS BAD.

933
00:48:24,384 --> 00:48:26,152
I HEAR YOU'RE GOING TO BE
OPENING UP AN EATING HOUSE,

934
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,141
GARRETT.

935
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:30,156
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SECURE
AN ADVERTISEMENT?

936
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,418
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.

937
00:48:33,426 --> 00:48:35,160
JEEZUM CROW.

938
00:48:35,161 --> 00:48:38,164
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT
THE SANTA FE RING HIRED--

939
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,465
NEVER MIND THAT.

940
00:48:39,466 --> 00:48:41,161
I WANT TO HIRE YOU
FOR A JOB.

941
00:48:41,468 --> 00:48:42,468
YOU DO?

942
00:48:42,469 --> 00:48:45,170
I WANT YOU TO DOCUMENT
THE HUNT

943
00:48:45,171 --> 00:48:47,507
FOR THE MOST FAMOUS MAN
IN NEW MEXICO.

944
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:49,508
I WANT
A BOOK WRITTEN ON IT

945
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:52,178
SO THAT THE PEOPLE WILL
UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION.

946
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,510
I WANT YOU
TO RIDE ALONG WITH ME

947
00:48:55,181 --> 00:48:56,170
AND RECORD THE DANGERS
OF THE EXPEDITION.

948
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:59,552
RIDEALONG WITH YOU?
ON A HORSE?

949
00:48:59,553 --> 00:49:01,120
OH, NO.

950
00:49:01,121 --> 00:49:02,488
THIS I CAN'T DO.

951
00:49:02,489 --> 00:49:07,127
I CAME OUT WEST
TO SAVE MY LAST LUNG.

952
00:49:07,128 --> 00:49:09,128
I'M A JOURNALIST.

953
00:49:09,129 --> 00:49:11,131
YOU'RE
A BROKE JOURNALIST,

954
00:49:11,132 --> 00:49:14,532
AND YOU'RE A DRUNK.

955
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:24,144
THE COUNTRY WAS OVERGROWN
WITH WEED AND BRUSH

956
00:49:24,145 --> 00:49:27,381
AND ENCUMBERED
WITH LOOSE ROCK,

957
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:30,617
MAKING IT
ALMOST IMPASSABLE.

958
00:49:30,618 --> 00:49:32,151
I LIKE THAT.

959
00:49:32,152 --> 00:49:33,619
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

960
00:49:38,158 --> 00:49:39,648
MORNING, SHERIFF.

961
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,650
WE MET AT THE GOVERNOR'S.

962
00:49:42,162 --> 00:49:44,164

963
00:49:44,165 --> 00:49:46,166
THE GOVERNOR SENT ME
AND THESE MEN

964
00:49:46,167 --> 00:49:48,167
TO LEND YOU A HAND.

965
00:49:48,168 --> 00:49:50,159
ENCUMBERED BY IDIOTS,
WE PRESSED ON.

966
00:49:50,704 --> 00:49:52,700
I LIKE THAT.

967
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:54,697
IT'S VERY GOOD.

968
00:50:06,186 --> 00:50:08,788
WHAT DID THEY DO NOW--
SPELL YOUR NAME WRONG?

969
00:50:08,789 --> 00:50:10,490
THEY GOT A NEW SHERIFF
ON US, BOYS.

970
00:50:10,491 --> 00:50:12,192
GOES BY THE NAME
OF PAT GARRETT.

971
00:50:12,193 --> 00:50:13,792
JESUS CHRIST!

972
00:50:13,793 --> 00:50:17,197
WHAT THE HELL
DID HE DO THAT FOR?

973
00:50:17,198 --> 00:50:18,699
MAKE HISSELF FAMOUS.

974
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,267
BE A KNOWN MAN LIKE ME.

975
00:50:20,268 --> 00:50:21,834
HEY, WHAT ABOUT ME?

976
00:50:21,835 --> 00:50:23,203
WHAT DID THEY SAY
ABOUT ME, HUH?

977
00:50:23,204 --> 00:50:24,837
NOTHING, DAVE.

978
00:50:24,838 --> 00:50:27,206
JUST PLAYING THE GAME,
DOC.

979
00:50:27,207 --> 00:50:29,709
WE'LL GIVE HIM A GAME,
ALL RIGHT.

980
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:31,795
ALL RIGHT, DAVE'S BOYS.
WE RIDE NOW.

981
00:50:31,796 --> 00:50:33,879
WE ARE GOING TO GIVE
PAT GARRETT

982
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,882
THE RIDE OF HIS MISERABLE
TWO-FACED STINKING LIFE.

983
00:50:35,883 --> 00:50:37,213
LET'S SKIN OUT! COME ON!

984
00:50:43,223 --> 00:50:44,918
WELL, COME ON!

985
00:50:46,926 --> 00:50:49,963
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS?

986
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,230
OK, TOM.

987
00:50:51,231 --> 00:50:54,968
LAST ONE OUT OF HERE
DRINKS DIRTY DISHWATER.

988
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:56,969
COME ON!

989
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,995
SON OF A BITCH!

990
00:51:22,128 --> 00:51:23,186
HO.

991
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,199
BURIAL GROUND.

992
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,191
WARM SPRINGS PEOPLE.

993
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,204
APACHE.

994
00:51:32,205 --> 00:51:34,207
WE BETTER GET GOING.

995
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:35,709
WE'LL GO AROUND.

996
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:37,209
WHAT IS IT--

997
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:39,212
CHAVEZ, WHY DON'T YOU
GO PECK SHIT

998
00:51:39,213 --> 00:51:41,213
WITH THE CHICKENS, HUH?

999
00:51:41,214 --> 00:51:43,215

00:51:43,216 --> 00:51:45,218
FOR APACHE BONE
IN SILVER CITY RIGHT NOW?

1001
00:51:45,219 --> 00:51:47,219

00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,222
THEY'RE MAKING ASHTRAYS,
THEY'RE MAKING COMBS,

1003
00:51:49,223 --> 00:51:50,222
THEY'RE MAKING
KNIFE HANDLES.

1004
00:51:50,223 --> 00:51:52,214
YOU GET 5O CENTS
FOR A GOOD INDIAN LEG BONE.

1005
00:51:53,226 --> 00:51:54,226

YAH!
