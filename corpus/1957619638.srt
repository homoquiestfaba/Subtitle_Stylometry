[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,150
What do you do when things start looking the same?

3
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:25,819
Sounding the same?

4
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,688
Feeling the same?

5
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:33,726
What do you do when you become tired of pleasing somebody?

6
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,496
How do you get that freedom to say what's really on your mind?

[PHONE RINGING]

8
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,352
Hello?

9
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:00,286
Hi.

10
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,458
I can come directly from work.

11
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:08,761
OK.

12
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,735
OK.

13
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:16,703
Bye bye.

14
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:20,940
Your husband?

15
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,676
No, Donald.

16
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,811
What does he want?

17
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,382
I'm having dinner with him tonight.

18
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:42,962
I was kind of hoping we could spend

19
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,497
some time together tonight.

20
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:45,932
You know, I'm leaving Friday.

21
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:46,966
I know.

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,901
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:48,701
He's making this film soon.

24
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:52,472
This could be my chance to learn.

25
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,840
Has he even raised the money?

26
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:54,774
Yeah.

27
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:57,844
How'd he get it?

28
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:58,778
His family.

29
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,353
What does he want you to do anyway?

30
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,823
I told you, his assistant.

31
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,592
What's the underwear for?

32
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,461
He said I can take a shower at his place.

33
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,331
Why do you need to take a shower?

34
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,933
What do you think?

35
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,034
I need to change.

36
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,469
I would like to take a shower at the end of the day.

37
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,672
So why don't you come back here to shower?

38
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,941
Paul, I'm not driving 40 minutes fighting traffic.

39
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,947
What do you got for me today?

40
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,316
Two.

41
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,550
Videos?

42
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,251
One more.

43
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,619
Videos, videos, three videos.

44
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:40,353
Thank you very much.

45
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,688
- You're welcome. - Bye, sweetie.

46
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,622
Bye.

47
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,993
Beyond me.

48
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:47,860
Why?

49
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,929
I just don't see what men see in men.

50
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:50,897
Hm.

51
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,935
Especially when there are women like you around.

52
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,306
It's too early for that, Randy.

53
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,040
No.

54
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,408
I mean it.

55
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,877
I'm touched.

56
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,613
Is it true that you're leaving us?

57
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:07,547
I don't know yet.

58
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,483
I find out this evening.

59
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:11,884
So you're going to file for divorce?

60
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,852
I don't know.

61
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:15,488
It's only been two months since I left him.

62
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:19,592
A couple of his friends are coming to LA next week.

63
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:24,063
He wants me to go and stay with them while they're here.

64
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,399
Are you going to go?

65
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,668
Things are beyond repair really.

66
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,470
So why didn't you call me after that?

67
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,537
It's been what?

68
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,072
Two months I haven't seen you.

69
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,009
Well, I wanted to settle, find a job.

70
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,043
Oh, yeah, tell me about that.

71
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:40,346
It's a film production company?

72
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,082
They mainly do music videos.

73
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,817
So what exactly do you do for them?

74
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,053
I handle the phone.

75
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,555
Well, don't worry about it.

76
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:50,757
Once we start doing this film, you're

77
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,458
going to be doing much better.

78
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,661
And if you need anything now, all you have to do is ask.

79
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:55,962
I want you to know that. - Thanks.

80
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:57,397
I'm OK.

81
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,598
When do you think we'll start?

82
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,767
Soon.

83
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,036
Very soon.

84
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,837
I'm still having a few problems with the script,

85
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,040
so I want to finish it first.

86
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,042
Hm.

87
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,677
Well, why don't you show it to me?

88
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,578
I mean, I won't judge you or think any less of you

89
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,047
if it's you know--

90
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,583
Well, maybe I should do that finally.

91
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,519
Tell you what, I'll show you the outline

92
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,521
when we come back from dinner.

93
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:22,455
OK.

94
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:26,826
I got to tell you something.

95
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,861
What?

96
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:32,665
I lost one of my main backers for the film.

97
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,866
What happened?

98
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,536
Well, you know how these things go.

99
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,705
I thought it was family money.

100
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:39,772
Well, it is.

101
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:40,707
I mean, not really.

102
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,475
Not all of it.

103
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,510
So you're not going to be able to make it?

104
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:45,878
Oh, yeah, I'm going to be able to make it.

105
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,046
It just might take a couple of weeks

106
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,748
longer to get it in place, that's all.

107
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,052
See, that's why we're having dinner with Max.

108
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:56,422
I want to ask him if you'd be willing to get involved.

109
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,790
Can he raise money?

110
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:58,691
Can he raise money?

111
00:05:58,725 --> 00:05:59,692
Yeah.

112
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,462
He's one of the biggest people in the business.

113
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,530
So what do you want to do in this business, Helen?

114
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,099
I just want to write.

115
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,501
Have you written anything?

116
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,671
I've been working on something for the past couple of months

117
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:15,575
since I finished school, but I have put it aside for now.

118
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,910
Just to gain some perspective.

119
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:21,447
In the meantime, I want to get involved in production.

120
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,583
I'll be helping Don with his film.

121
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,218
Oh, what's it about?

122
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,019
Deception.

123
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,555
What about deception?

124
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,825
Well, you know the lies men and women tell each other.

125
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,861
Is there a story?

126
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,463
A story.

127
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,700
Well, in a nutshell, it's about this guy

128
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,002
who believes that the only way he can win

129
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:46,038
the woman of his dreams is by pretending

130
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,306
to be wealthy and powerful.

131
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,777
So when he finally meets this beautiful woman in the boutique

132
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,782
where she works, he poses as a big time stockbroker,

133
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,884
and she falls for him.

134
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,720
And something begins to develop between them,

135
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,089
but you see, this way he's trapped himself.

136
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:07,493
He doesn't know if she's after him for himself

137
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,862
or for his money.

138
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,265
Why would he think she's after his money?

139
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,801
Well, because he knows that she has a dream.

140
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,837
She wants to establish her own boutique.

141
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,639
Doesn't she realize he's a fake?

142
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:20,573
Not really.

143
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,009
You see, he's very clever.

144
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:25,611
He keeps buying her gifts and taking her places, you know,

145
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,946
to protect his image.

146
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,682
She tells him all kinds of lies too.

147
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,884
Like her family's very wealthy, you know,

148
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,822
so he doesn't get the impression that she's after his money,

149
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:39,225
and she fakes her orgasms.

150
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,728
She fakes her orgasms?

151
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:43,963
Poor darling.

152
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:47,200
Does he know she's faking?

153
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,869
We know, but he suspects.

154
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,671
How does this story resolve itself, Don.

155
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:52,872
I haven't worked out the ending yet.

156
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,006
I don't know if I want to keep them

157
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,141
together or have them part.

158
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,075
I don't know.

159
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,977
Uh-huh.

160
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,280
Well, it sounds interesting.

161
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,015
I think so.

162
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:08,721
It's amazing how much deception there is between men and women,

163
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,189
especially here in LA today.

164
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,291
I mean, there's a lot of sex being sold.

165
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,661
Sometimes just the promise of sex.

166
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,563
You really believe that?

167
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:18,531
Yeah.

168
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:21,200
All this obsession with success and careers.

169
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:25,071
I mean, it's not who a person is anymore.

170
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,206
It's what you can do for me.

171
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,775
You have something I want, fine.

172
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:30,810
If not, I'll get it elsewhere.

173
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:31,777
I don't think that you can--

174
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,246
And people are going for the highest bid.

175
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,113
I don't think--

176
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,781
Love is becoming an old fashioned word.

177
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,116
I don't think you can reduce it to that.

178
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,718
Oh, come on, Gail.

179
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:39,852
Look around you.

180
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,688
If you're not driving a Mercedes or a Jaguar in this town

181
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:43,789
people think you're a loser.

182
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,592
Darling, men are much more obsessed with success

183
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,662
than women, and they're willing to go to any length to make it.

184
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,031
They're willing to lie, cheat, you name it.

185
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,266
They'd sell their mothers for it.

186
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,235
That's because they know it's the only thing women go for.

187
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,036
Oh, please.

188
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,171
All right, guys, listen, listen.

189
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,339
This is just a movie, right?

190
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,812
What do you think about all this, Helen?

191
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:11,918
I think it can be true sometimes.

192
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,120
I think it's more complex than that, not

193
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,621
that you're being simplistic.

194
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,089
Oh.

195
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:20,693
Anyway, we can shoot the whole thing for under a million.

196
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:24,263
No special effects, no car crashes, nothing.

197
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,400
Most of the scenes take place indoors, bedrooms, living

198
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:30,169
rooms, you know, restaurants.

199
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,238
A lot of scenes in restaurants.

200
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,040
It's amazing between men and women

201
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,310
how much action takes place in restaurants.

202
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:38,311
Uh-huh.

203
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,245
Well, I'd like to read it.

204
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,015
Excuse me.

205
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,426
She's very nice.

206
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,861
Very.

207
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,698
So tell me, Don, you and she uh?

208
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,102
Huh?

209
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,236
Huh?

210
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,939
Well, we're good friends really.

211
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,341
I mean, we do have a relationship,

212
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:13,412
but she sees other men, and I'm free to see other women.

213
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,685
He wants to show me the outline.

214
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,420
PAUL: I'll bet he does.

215
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,254
Paul.

216
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,990
PAUL: He might also want you to take

217
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,257
another shower at his place.

218
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,462
Why can't you just--

219
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,164
just say that you have to leave?

220
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,799
Just take a stand for once.

221
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,735
I have to go.

222
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:36,469
PAUL: All right then.

223
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:37,937
I'll be at your place at 1:00.

224
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,009
So you called someone?

225
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:43,943
Uh-huh.

226
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,081
Your husband?

227
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:49,982
I had to call.

228
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,885
Your husband?

229
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:53,686
Uh-huh.

230
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,022
You had to call him at midnight?

231
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,823
Yeah.

232
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,359
I thought you called him today.

233
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,327
He worries.

234
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,464
That's my problem.

235
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,066
I can't seem to take a stand.

236
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,976
Do you want her to lie so much?

237
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,178
Why not?

238
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,947
But do we like her?

239
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,116
Do we have to?

240
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,318
It would help.

241
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,321
Instead of having her tell outright lies,

242
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:36,796
why don't you have her conceal things?

243
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:37,830
That might be better.

244
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,068
Yeah.

245
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,269
Actually, when you finish the first draft,

246
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:46,972
I might have a better idea of what you're trying to say.

247
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,108
I think so.

248
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:50,543
I had a great time.

249
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,510
I'm glad.

250
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,551
You know, you can stay here if you like?

251
00:11:58,584 --> 00:11:59,518
It's tempting.

252
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,356
I should go home.

253
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,859
OK.

254
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,294
Well, I'll walk you down.

255
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,874
Stay with me tonight.

256
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:22,808
I can't tonight.

257
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,202
You know, when you were with your husband,

258
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,505
I didn't want to confuse you.

259
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,941
I was always concerned about our friendship.

260
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,444
You'll always have that.

261
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,880
Let me take you somewhere, a little vacation.

262
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,584
Where?

263
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,519
Hawaii.

264
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,786
Mexico.

265
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,856
Just someplace to get some fresh air, something like five days

266
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,358
maybe?

267
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:15,628
I mean, you need it after this ordeal.

268
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,496
Let's do that.

269
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,233
Can you get off work for five days?

270
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,134
I don't know.

271
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,302
I have to see.

272
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,304
Can you take two days off?

273
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,540
Maybe like Thursday and Friday, then

274
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,075
we can come back Sunday night.

275
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:33,078
It's a possibility.

276
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,381
OK.

277
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:39,084
Well, I'll call my travel agent and let you know then.

278
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,052
OK.

279
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,157
Goodnight.

280
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,091
Goodnight.

281
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,252
- Hey. - Ah!

282
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:14,186
Jesus.

283
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,325
I knew you were going to park here.

284
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,663
So how was dinner?

285
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,265
Dinner was fine.

286
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,433
I don't know why you want to waste

287
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,235
your time working on his--

288
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,303
on other people's projects.

289
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,305
I mean, I think if you should work on your own script.

290
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,642
Don't bug me about my script, OK?

291
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,377
All right, but at least show it to other people,

292
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,245
for God's sake.

293
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,146
I mean, if you don't trust my opinion,

294
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,314
then show it to someone who knows.

295
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,149
I think it's great. - Yeah, right.

296
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:48,420
That's the most self pitying trash ever written?

297
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:52,091
You're never going to let me forget that, are you?

298
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,593
No, I guess not.

299
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,563
You are in a lousy mood tonight, aren't you?

300
00:14:57,596 --> 00:15:00,232
I don't want you waiting for me.

301
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,469
I didn't leave my husband to get in this kind of relationship.

302
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,577
You know, the place is really jammed.

303
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,045
I know the owner. He'll take care of us.

304
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,718
All right. When?

305
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,986
Really?

306
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,254
Uh-huh.

307
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,155
Tonight.

308
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,657
Where is it again?

309
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,294
Santa Monica and 5th.

310
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,228
What's it called?

311
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,162
5th Avenue.

312
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:38,370
By the way, I talked to the travel agent,

313
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:42,775
and we can go to Hawaii on Wednesday for five days.

314
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,677
I really shouldn't do that.

315
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,745
Why not?

316
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,515
All my problems with Ted, I just--

317
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,517
I just don't feel like it.

318
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,584
Well, that's why you should go.

319
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,387
It'll make you feel better.

320
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,423
I don't want to get involved now.

321
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,391
We won't get involved.

322
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,593
We'll sleep in separate beds.

323
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:05,664
I'll wear a chastity belt. I'll give you the key.

324
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,167
What do you think?

325
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,469
I can't afford to leave work now, honestly.

326
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,371
Don't worry about work.

327
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,606
What do you mean, don't worry?

328
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,308
Of course, I worry. - I'll help you out.

329
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,209
You need money?

330
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:19,211
I'm doing OK.

331
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:20,145
No, really, tell me.

332
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,382
I want to help you solve your problems.

333
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:26,085
The problem solver.

334
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,687
Specifically financial problems.

335
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,756
I'm doing OK.

336
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,524
You don't have any financial problems?

337
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,526
No, I mean, I have my credit card debt,

338
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,362
but it's not really a problem.

339
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,563
How much is it?

340
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,299
Like $3,000.

341
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:44,236
$3,000.

342
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,071
I didn't spend it on nothing though.

343
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,777
It's really what I survived on after I left Ted.

344
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,545
I can lend you $1,000.

345
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,447
I don't want to have to do that.

346
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:58,250
Think of it as a long term loan, no interest.

347
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,852
You can pay me back when you can.

348
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,720
When you sell your script.

349
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,122
Wouldn't that ease you off a little?

350
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:06,658
I got my checkbook in the car.

351
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,797
Come on, what are you so scared of?

352
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,832
Nothing.

353
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,635
Well, let's do it.

354
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:17,803
I guess I better tell you.

355
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:18,771
What?

356
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,841
You may have noticed I'm seeing someone.

357
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,716
No, I had no idea.

358
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:31,683
Yeah.

359
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,218
How long's it been?

360
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,186
Almost a year.

361
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,524
You left your husband for him?

362
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,224
No.

363
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,592
I would have left Ted anyway.

364
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:47,132
So how's it going?

365
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,535
Not very well.

366
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,770
We broke up a couple of times.

367
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:52,738
Now it's kind of--

368
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,611
but he's the only one who knows my life

00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,919
That'd be great, but I feel I might be imposing.

740
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:35,853
No.

741
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:36,921
This is like your place.

742
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:40,791
I want you to be comfortable.

743
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:46,697
I mean, I really had to think a lot about this because we're

744
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,632
not distant enough to be roommates,

745
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:51,168
but at the same time, we're not close enough

746
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:53,370
that I would want you to observe my life

747
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,740
like you were my girlfriend.

748
00:42:56,774 --> 00:43:00,210
I mean, not that I have anything to hide, but--

749
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,145
it's really cool with me.

750
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:08,886
OK.

751
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:12,790
Um, here.

752
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:14,158
You can use this closet here.

753
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:26,170
In fact, there's also this one in case

754
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:28,038
the one outside isn't enough.

755
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:29,873
Oh, it should be big enough.

756
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:33,210
I don't have very many things.

757
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:38,115
Oh, and here you have towels, bed sheets, everything.

758
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:40,117
OK.

759
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,152
I'll bring my futon.

760
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:43,087
OK.

761
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:53,764
Hi.

762
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,699
Hi, Gary, let me give you the keys.

763
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:01,171
Thanks.

764
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:03,040
I'll send out that deposit in the mail right away.

765
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:03,874
Yes.

766
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,242
Thanks for being so understanding.

767
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:06,210
No problem.

768
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,784
Wait a minute. Let me help you with that.

769
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:34,138
You know, I'm really glad you got another car,

770
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:37,207
but I still think you should have bought a new one.

771
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:39,410
I know, me too.

772
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:42,446
How much did you put down on it, $500 over the phone.

773
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:43,781
Hey, that's easy.

774
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:06,336
Perfect.

775
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:12,376
What time is the birthday party with Max?

776
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,211
8:00.

777
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:15,879
Where?

778
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:20,317
At [INAUDIBLE] at the Bellage Hotel.

779
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:21,285
Oh, shit.

780
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:23,554
What?

781
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:25,489
That's a formal place, isn't it?

782
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:26,390
Yeah.

783
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:28,492
Why?

784
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:30,194
Ah, you don't have anything to wear.

785
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:38,802
Oh, you've got to buy this one.

786
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,804
I think it's the best so far.

787
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:42,239
Go for it.

788
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:43,173
I can't.

789
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,008
It's too expensive.

790
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,578
Excuse me, how much is this?

791
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:51,949
$950, about $1,000 with tax.

792
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:53,150
That's insane.

793
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:54,051
Why?

794
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,819
It's gorgeous.

795
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:58,388
I can't do that.

796
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,225
Why can't you have one nice piece to wear?

797
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,327
It's better than 10 cheap ones.

798
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,563
Don, this is crazy.

799
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,166
I can't spend that.

800
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:13,103
I've never ever spent more than $100 on anything.

801
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:14,171
We're going to think about it.

802
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:15,472
Take your time.

803
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:16,573
OK.

804
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,908
How much do you want to spend?

805
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,843
I don't want to spend anything.

806
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:22,913
I want to buy something and return it.

807
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:23,947
Let's go to the department store.

808
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:25,349
They're not going to have anything like this.

809
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:26,283
This is so different.

810
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:28,118
It's so classy. - No, no.

811
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:29,186
It's irrational.

812
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:30,354
OK.

813
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:32,156
I'll pay half, just add it to the bill.

814
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,524
I don't want to do that.

815
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:34,558
Just think of it as rent.

816
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:36,960
You're not paying rent anymore.

817
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:40,898
I know, but I have a lot of debt, and what for?

818
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:42,299
Just one evening?

819
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:43,967
It's not going to be just one evening.

820
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:46,470
You're going to be wearing it so many times.

821
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:48,105
We're going to make this movie.

822
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,975
You can wear it to the premiere.

823
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,277
I'm really looking forward to it.

824
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,979
So am I. Come on.

825
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:57,147
Nope.

826
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:58,348
I can't.

827
00:46:58,382 --> 00:46:59,983
Come on, you'll never regret it.

828
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:08,492
Don, I don't know if this is the right time,

829
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:10,561
but I wanted to talk to you anyway.

830
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:11,495
I read the script.

831
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:12,429
Yeah?

832
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:15,999
And frankly, I don't think it's there yet.

833
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:17,367
No?

834
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,303
I don't think the characters are sympathetic.

835
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,604
I think they're flat.

836
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:21,538
We don't like them.

837
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:23,674
I think we've got to like them.

838
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:26,543
[INAUDIBLE],, you know, they're always lying to one another,

839
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:29,580
and he's allowing her to use him because he wants sex from her.

840
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:32,115
That's fine, but it's not enough.

841
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:34,017
It's not enough.

842
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:35,552
How are you going to show she's faking an orgasm?

843
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:42,326
Well, I felt that would be a matter of acting.

844
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,661
I mean, a good actress could do that.

845
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:45,596
No, no, no.

846
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:46,496
That's not the point.

847
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,233
That's not the point.

848
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:54,204
I think that we shouldn't know.

849
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:57,074
We should only suspect, just like he does.

850
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:58,375
Yeah.

851
00:47:58,408 --> 00:47:59,243
That's good.

852
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:01,144
Also, if he's pretending to be wealthy,

853
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:03,080
she should start suspecting earlier.

854
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:04,348
I mean, things got to keep on coming up

855
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:08,151
like maybe the manager of the apartment house

856
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:10,354
keeps on knocking on the door because the rent's always late,

857
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,222
and she sees this.

858
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:16,126
Or collection agency, you know, calling up all the time

859
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:19,229
because, you know, he's late paying for the credit cards.

860
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:20,430
You know, it builds tension that way.

861
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:21,198
You know what to say?

862
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,199
Yeah.

863
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,500
I think it's much more interesting that way.

864
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:24,635
But, you know, Helen and I are going

865
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:27,237
to rewrite the whole thing, so I think the second draft

866
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:29,239
is going to be much better.

867
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:30,173
Good.

868
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,009
Good.

869
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:34,144
I gotta get back to my guests.

870
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:35,212
Hey, happy birthday again.

871
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,513
- Thanks. - Thanks so much.

872
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:37,748
Bye.

Hi.

00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,417
Morning.

882
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:50,620
Here's your breakfast.

883
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:55,792
You're so sweet.

00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,528
It's one time thing only, just to make you feel welcome.

Oh, not every day, huh?

886
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,332
You don't have to do this.

887
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:05,635
Well, I won't if you start behaving like you're at home.

888
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,270
I am though.

889
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:09,272
No, you're not.

You're always hiding in the bathroom.

00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:15,078
Uh-huh.

00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:16,279

What do you do about it?

900
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,264
Nothing at the moment.

901
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:42,506
Oh, here's a duplicate key to the door.

902
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:43,473
Thank you.

Oh, no, no.

It shouldn't take long.

910
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,562
About an hour, hour and a half?

911
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:07,764
Yeah, I may have to wait.

912
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,332
Well, even if I have to wait, it shouldn't

913
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:11,301
take longer than that.

914
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:13,870

You can mail the deposit.

Very talented.

948
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:44,694
And the thing is he wrote a very personal script.

949
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:46,730
I just get the feeling he's not telling the whole story.

950
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:52,302
I get this sense that he's afraid of revealing himself.

951
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,304
It's very hard sometimes.

Oh, I know.

953
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:58,575
But as a writer, he's going to have to open up,

954
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:00,477
otherwise it's not going to work.

955
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,912

Not all women do that.

I feel like I'm being interrogated.

1081
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:16,679
I don't mean to interrogate you.

1082
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:18,915
We just got to find out why these characters are lying.

But then we worked together on a final project at school,

1105
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:04,854
and I started to see how much more there was to him.

1106
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:07,924
We really went through so much together,

1107
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:09,525
and that was exactly at the time Ted

1108
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,261
and I were fighting all the time.

1109
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:16,032
And he cared, you know?

1110
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:19,969
But then after I left Ted, he got so serious

1111
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:23,039
he started talking marriage.

1112
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,373
Would you marry him?

1113
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:27,143
I don't know.

1114
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:29,345
I don't know if he knows what he wants.

1115
01:02:29,378 --> 01:02:32,982
I mean, I don't even know if I know what I want.

1116
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:35,451
And he's changed.

1117
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:40,022
When we were in school, I thought he was so idealistic.

1118
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:42,125
He was always talking about all these great films

1119
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:45,328
that he wanted to make, how he didn't care about the money.

1120
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:48,364
Now all he cares about is the money.

1121
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:49,298
I hate it.

1122
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:54,270
Did Ted know about him?

1123
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:55,204
I told him.

1124
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,376
Why did you tell him?

1125
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:03,913
Because he kept saying, if there's another man,

1126
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:04,847
I'll understand.

1127

1129

It was such a nightmare.

1130
01:03:16,192 --> 01:03:20,429
If I went to the market or if I stayed late at school,

1131
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:24,500
he'd think I went and him-- to see him, even when I didn't.

1132
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:25,468
He'd go.

01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,075
For instance, I like the way that you took the story

1285
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:36,578
behind the breakup of her husband,

1286
01:13:36,612 --> 01:13:39,248
but the ending still isn't right.

1287
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:45,187
If you want us to get a real true sense of her independence,

1288
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:47,790
she's got to learn how to take a stand.

1289
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:49,691
She's got to learn how to say no,

1290
01:13:49,725 --> 01:13:50,893
and I don't mean just to her husband,

1291
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,227
but to all men who try to control it.

1292
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,029
That way, it will make the character richer.

1293
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:57,499
You'll find your ending that way.

1294
01:13:57,533 --> 01:13:58,600
Now, we've com to the best part.

1295
01:13:58,634 --> 01:13:59,568
Are you ready?

1296
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:09,611
This is a check for $5,000.

1297
01:14:09,645 --> 01:14:11,780
It's yours.

1298
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:14,082
And this is a contract.

1299
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,018
Basically, what it says is that you have

1300
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:17,886
to do a rewrite within 30 days.

1301
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,522
If I like it, you get another $5,000.

1302
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:22,991
If you don't finish it in 30 days, or I don't like it,

1303
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:24,760
you still get to keep the first check,

1304
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:26,161
but I own the rights to what you've written,

1305
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:27,729
and then I find someone else to rewrite it.

1306
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:32,668
Is it really that good?

1307
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:33,569
Yes.

1308
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:35,070
You didn't know that?

1309
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:36,271
No.

1310
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:37,973
I mean, I didn't know that it was good enough for people

1311
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:41,543
to put money up for it.

1312
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:43,178
Well, now you do, don't you?

1313
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:26,622
You know, can keep the check and the contract for now.

1314
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:28,056
I need some time to think about this.

1315
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:33,862
Look, if you don't like the deal--

1316
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:36,365
No, no.

1317
01:15:36,398 --> 01:15:42,237
It's just that sometimes I feel like I've been in this maze,

1318
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:44,172
and I kept making the wrong turn.

1319
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:53,015
All right.

1320
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:55,017
I'll give you a week, Helen.

1321
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,752
I think it's about time you made the right turn.

1322
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:02,925
Excuse me, you're will to stay as long as you like, but may

1323
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:03,625
I take this now?

1324
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:04,893
We're closing the cash register.

1325
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:06,128
No problem.

1326
01:16:06,161 --> 01:16:07,062
Let me get half.

1327
01:16:07,095 --> 01:16:08,363
No.

1328
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:09,331
Are you sure?

1329
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:10,299
Uh-huh.

1330
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:24,179
Saw Don again today.

1331
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:25,881
Yeah?

1332
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:26,848
Yeah.

1333
01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:29,685
Can you believe that thing about his friend?

1334
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:30,886
What friend?

1335
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:33,288
He didn't tell you?

1336
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:35,891
No.

1337
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:37,159
I don't know if I should tell you this.

1338
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:37,893
No. What is it?

1339
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:42,965
Well, he was hoping to raise half the money for his film

1340
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:46,668
from his friend, and they had a falling

1341
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:49,805
out apparently over a woman that Don was seeing.

1342
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:53,976
You really didn't know about this?

1343
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:56,345
He did tell me a few weeks ago that he lost his backers,

1344
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:59,982
but he didn't say anything about a woman.

1345
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:00,916
Well.

1346
01:17:04,052 --> 01:17:04,853
So now what?

1347
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:06,121
You're the only one who can help him

1348
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:09,224
it seems, because he can't get money from his family either,

1349
01:17:09,257 --> 01:17:10,926
you said. - What family?

1350
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:11,994
His family's got no money.

1351
01:17:16,031 --> 01:17:17,933
You know, Don hasn't been working.

1352
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:19,368
He's been living off his credit cards.

1353
01:17:24,072 --> 01:17:25,774
Helen, I really want to help him, but unless

1354
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:28,176
he does that rewrite, I'm--

1355
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:30,278
Are you still working together?

1356
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,881
Yeah.

1357
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:36,018
Well, I think you should help him, Helen.

1358
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:04,046
What are you doing out here?

1359
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:06,314
Well, it's such a beautiful day, you know?

1360
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:09,418
I thought we could talk about the script out in the open.

1361
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:11,219
Oh.

1362
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:12,788
I got some great news.

1363
01:18:12,821 --> 01:18:13,755
What?

1364
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:16,358
I got the male character all figured out.

1365
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:17,325
Good.

1366
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:22,431
I think he lies and pretends to have a lot of money

1367
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:24,833
because he feels unworthy.

1368
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:26,768
Why does he feel unworthy?

1369
01:18:26,802 --> 01:18:29,271
We could make him come from a poor background.

1370
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:30,772
But does he have to lie about it?

1371
01:18:30,806 --> 01:18:31,706
Yeah.

1372
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:33,442
What if he was in love with a rich girl

1373
01:18:33,475 --> 01:18:36,178
and her family was always condescending to him,

1374
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:37,179
so now he's hurt.

1375
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:41,116
He thinks that all anyone cares about is money.

1376
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:42,451
That makes sense.

1377
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:45,320
Makes a lot of sense.

1378
01:18:45,353 --> 01:18:47,122
He has to learn something in the end

1379
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:51,193
though, because not all women are after money and success.

1380
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:52,394
I mean, really.

1381
01:18:52,427 --> 01:18:53,962
Alright.

1382
01:18:53,995 --> 01:18:55,530
That's why it's important that you stay

1383
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:59,067
with him when he comes clean.

1384
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:01,336
Yeah, but we don't want to be sentimental here.

1385
01:19:01,369 --> 01:19:04,506
No, but you can have some hope in the end.

1386
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:08,310
Something like a bittersweet ending.

1387
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:10,045
I guess.

1388
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:15,283
You know, and I like this generous quality about him.

1389
01:19:15,317 --> 01:19:17,586
I mean, like always buying her things.

1390
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:19,121
I like that in people.

1391
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:20,055
Don't you?

1392
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:22,491
Oh, sure, just as long as there

1393
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:27,829
are no expectations though, because otherwise it's--

1394
01:19:27,863 --> 01:19:30,832
my father used to do that. - Yeah?

1395
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:35,504
Yeah, bought me a car for my high school graduation.

1396
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:39,107
After my mother died, I wanted to go live with Ted

1397
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:42,410
and he said, yeah, you can go, just leave the car.

1398
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:44,946
And I thought, God, what's that?

1399
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:46,848
I mean, it's a gift.

1400
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:50,152
It's a gift.

1401
01:19:52,988 --> 01:19:57,626
How did we get onto this?

1402
01:19:57,659 --> 01:19:59,161
You cold?

1403
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:00,228
HELEN: Yeah.

1404
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:02,230
You want some coffee?

1405
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:04,599
HELEN: I'm going to take you to dinner tonight.

1406
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:05,634
Really?

1407
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:07,402
HELEN: Yeah.

1408
01:20:07,435 --> 01:20:08,336
OK.

1409
01:20:19,514 --> 01:20:21,116
Paul?

1410
01:20:21,149 --> 01:20:22,217
You remember my name.

1411
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:24,152
That's surprising.

1412
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:26,121
When did you get back?

1413
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:27,889
Last night, like I told you I was going to.

1414
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:28,990
Uh-huh.

1415
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:31,359
Well, do you want to meet or something, because this

1416
01:20:31,393 --> 01:20:33,028
isn't a place for me to be--

1417
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:34,162
No, I don't want to meet you.

1418
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:35,230
I want to talk to you now.

1419
01:20:35,263 --> 01:20:37,365
I want to know what the hell is going on with us.

1420
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:40,001
Why didn't you call me one time the whole time I was gone?

1421
01:20:40,035 --> 01:20:41,236
Paul, I can't do this now.

1422
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:43,238
Where the hell did you move to?

1423
01:20:43,271 --> 01:20:44,072
What is going on?

1424
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:46,107
Just once, one time in your life,

1425
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:48,210
give me one straight fucking answer.

1426
01:20:48,243 --> 01:20:50,979
Excuse me.

1427
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:52,480
Look, I don't mean to be an asshole,

1428
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:54,182
but this doesn't have anything to do with you.

1429
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:55,550
Look, I just want to talk to her.

1430
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:56,651
Randy.

1431
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:57,352
Look, I'm just going to call the cops, all right?

1432
01:20:57,385 --> 01:20:59,187
Well, then, fine, call them.

1433
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:00,155
Randy.

1434
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:02,057
Please, will you answer the phones for me?

1435
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:03,491
Could you go outside?

1436
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:13,668
Jesus, I'm gone barely three weeks,

1437
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:17,138
and it's like a different world now.

1438
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:22,677
You don't want to be with me anymore?

1439
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:25,447
Not as lovers.

1440
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:27,182
As friends.

1441
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:29,584
All right.

1442
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:31,686
Why don't we get married?

1443
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,588
You're being childish.

1444
01:21:33,622 --> 01:21:34,522
Why?

1445
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:37,993
Oh, I'm not good enough?

1446
01:21:38,026 --> 01:21:40,495
It's much deeper than that.

1447
01:21:40,528 --> 01:21:42,631
What is it?

1448
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:44,266
I can't breathe with you.

1449
01:21:44,299 --> 01:21:45,433
You're all over my life.

1450
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:54,442
I want to be in every part of your life.

1451
01:21:54,476 --> 01:21:55,543
I mean, isn't that what you want?

1452
01:22:01,449 --> 01:22:04,719
I guess not.

1453
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:08,390
You know, I think it's finally going to work.

1454
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:10,325
I'm glad.

1455
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:11,293
I owe it all to you.

1456
01:22:13,795 --> 01:22:14,996
I didn't do anything.

1457
01:22:19,301 --> 01:22:22,203
All those probing questions.

1458
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:25,507
I owe you a lot too.

1459
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:30,712
You know, this whole story was based on my relationship

1460
01:22:30,745 --> 01:22:32,047
with Monica.

1461
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,114
Yeah?

1462
01:22:33,148 --> 01:22:34,049
Yeah.

1463
01:22:34,082 --> 01:22:37,052
And Susan before.

1464
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:39,020
What happened?

1465
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:42,691
Well, someday I'll tell you.

1466
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:44,759
Just make sure you put in everything before you

1467
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:46,494
take it to Max again.

1468
01:22:46,528 --> 01:22:50,031
Oh, yeah.

1469
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:54,602
Because I'm not going to be able to work with you on it.

1470
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:55,537
Why?

1471
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:58,506
Just the way that my life is going now.

1472
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:00,041
I thought you liked the new ideas?

1473
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:00,809
I do like them.

1474
01:23:00,842 --> 01:23:01,810
I just can't do it now.

1475
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:03,478
Not at this point in my life.

1476
01:23:07,282 --> 01:23:08,483
You want to move out?

1477
01:23:08,516 --> 01:23:09,451
Yeah.

1478
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:13,455
Where will you go?

1479
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:14,389
I don't know.

1480
01:23:14,422 --> 01:23:18,626
I really want to be alone.

1481
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,762
You don't want to have a relationship with me?

1482
01:23:20,795 --> 01:23:24,199
I can't have a relationship now.

1483
01:23:24,232 --> 01:23:26,101
You can't have a relationship now,

1484
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:28,503
or you can't have a relationship with me?

1485
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:37,545
I can't have a relationship with you.

1486
01:23:37,579 --> 01:23:39,781
It's like I have to come clean.

1487
01:23:39,814 --> 01:23:42,617
I got to take a stand, and I got to make a choice.

1488
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:44,352
I think you're making the wrong choice.

1489
01:23:44,386 --> 01:23:45,620
I'll find out when I'm 50.

1490
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:51,359
Tell me.

1491
01:23:51,393 --> 01:23:53,461
Did you ever think of having a relationship with me?

1492
01:23:53,495 --> 01:23:55,363
Off and on.

1493
01:23:55,397 --> 01:23:57,265
When we would watch movies together, I thought,

1494
01:23:57,298 --> 01:23:59,367
gee, wouldn't it be--

1495
01:23:59,401 --> 01:24:01,102
but then you were with Monica.

1496
01:24:01,136 --> 01:24:03,104
I didn't know that you were interested in me.

1497
01:24:03,138 --> 01:24:04,072
I was.

1498
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:09,577
I kept getting mixed messages.

1499
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:12,147
I'm sorry.

1500
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:14,115
I give out mixed messages?

1501
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:18,153
Yeah, you most certainly do, and you do it on purpose.

1502
01:24:18,186 --> 01:24:19,721
At least, you always did it to me.

1503
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:21,523
Why would I want to do that?

1504
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:22,791
To get wanted and to keep me at bay.

1505
01:24:22,824 --> 01:24:25,693
I don't think you ever had any intention of sleeping with me.

1506
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:30,565
That's a terrible thing to say.

1507
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:35,837
And you don't think you'll change your mind?

1508
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:36,771
No.

1509
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,657
Hey.

1510
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:57,692
If you ever really did think of sleeping with me,

1511
01:24:57,725 --> 01:24:59,594
it's just because you thought I could get you somewhere.

1512
01:24:59,627 --> 01:25:01,830
I am sick of bullshit.

1513
01:25:19,347 --> 01:25:20,348
I'm sorry.

1514
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:16,371
You got to roll this up.

1515
01:26:16,404 --> 01:26:17,305
Watch it.

1516
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:18,239
There's dog shit there.

1517
01:26:18,273 --> 01:26:21,009
Where?

1518
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:22,644
I didn't see that.

1519
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:37,592
Don't be mad at me.

1520
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:38,927
I'm not.

1521
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,963
It's just me.

1522
01:26:41,996 --> 01:26:45,033
You know, I couldn't be there for Ted and he needed me.

1523
01:26:45,066 --> 01:26:46,968
I was everything to him.

1524
01:26:47,001 --> 01:26:48,903
He hates his job.

1525
01:26:48,937 --> 01:26:50,838
He wants me to go up north with him

1526
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:53,041
to see his mom for Christmas.

1527
01:26:53,074 --> 01:26:57,845
Take a little vacation, and that's not going to happen.

1528
01:26:57,879 --> 01:26:59,013
I couldn't be there for Paul.

1529
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:00,715
He also needed me.

1530
01:27:00,748 --> 01:27:05,053
I just don't want to feel that I couldn't be there for you.

1531
01:27:05,086 --> 01:27:06,387
Don't worry about me.

1532
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:28,876
Are you going rewrite the script?

1533
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:31,746
Oh, yeah, definitely.

1534
01:27:31,779 --> 01:27:32,914
Good luck.

1535
01:27:32,947 --> 01:27:33,881
You too.

1536
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:06,614
HELEN: When I left Donald that night,

1537
01:28:06,648 --> 01:28:08,916
I couldn't help wondering about the day

1538
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:12,120
when I would come back to him with enough freedom

1539
01:28:12,153 --> 01:28:13,821
to be his friend.

1540
01:28:13,855 --> 01:28:17,558
