1
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,907
(door opens)

2
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:38,070
(metal scraping)

3
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:04,186
(Romanian)
Tell me more. Tell me more.

4
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:07,289
Tell me how the world ends.

5
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,336
(continues in Romanian)

6
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,372
(Romanian)
No, it can't be.

7
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,745
(ethereal whispering)

8
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,147
lt can't.

9
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,684
Oh!

10
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,329
(thunderclap)

11
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,529
(man groans)

12
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:57,583
- Father Constantin?
- (distant laughter)

13
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,593
Oh, God.

14
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,713
(man) The last chapter of the Bible
is called Revelations.

15
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,944
It promises the end of life
as we know it.

16
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,256
If that's the case,
you might want to ask yourself:

17
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,883
Is that really such a good thing?

18
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,871
(Romanian) - Hello, Maria.
- Hello.

19
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,079
You're very pretty.

20
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,547
- Do you know that?
- l guess.

21
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,119
Would you like to be a sweet angel

22
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,523
and deliver a message for me?

23
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,117
OK.

24
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,856
Good.

25
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,666
Don't forget your ball.

26
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,127
Oh, my God.

27
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,076
(Romanian)
Somebody call an ambulance.

28
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,153
Now!

29
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,558
Can you hear me?

30
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,627
(ethereal voices)

31
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,956
- What's your name?
- Maria.

32
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,198
We're going to get you help, Maria, OK?

33
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:09,766
- Just lie very still.
- l have a message for you, Allison.

34
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:16,741
- What... What is it?
- l can't tell you... yet.

35
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,139
(man) Did you see that, Dylan?

36
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,144
It's begun.

37
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:50,443
He's already made the first move.

38
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:02,356
You see how he took a life,
without even lifting a finger?

39
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,898
That's genius.
Vintage Satan.

40
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,763
lt's all about keeping your hands clean.

41
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,203
That's why we're such a good match,
Dylan

42
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,935
l have to keep up appearances.

43
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,910
And you don't care how dirty you get.

44
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,783
Using the semi-auto this time, are we?

45
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,977
Any objections?

46
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:31,022
(man) l thought you said
it had a nasty pull to the left.

47
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:34,992
- l won't miss. Trust me.
- Good. Because this one's important.

48
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:40,894
- (Dylan) They're all important, aren't they?
- (man) No. This one more than usual.

49
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,959
And remember,
it has to be one clean shot to the head.

50
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:49,030
- After all, she's not your average monkey.
- lt will be.

51
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,270
(man) You've memorized
her morning routine.

52
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:56,312
She wakes at 6:45,
puts on the coffee at 6:50

53
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,247
and showers at 6:53.

54
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:02,287
She soaps herself from the toes up -
which is a little strange, actually,

55
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:05,653
because, when you think about it,
most people lather from the neck down.

56
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,955
(man) A man who relishes his work.

57
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:13,088
At 7:1 0, coffee cup in hand,
she stands by her window

58
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,032
and tosses breadcrumbs to the pigeons,

59
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:20,629
and cries over the little girl
who never deserved to die.

60
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,244
(man) One bullet.
Aren't we being a bit overconfident?

61
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,907
l told you.
l won't miss.

62
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,182
(man) No.

63
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,848
No. You don't wanna do that.

64
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:41,222
Eleven murders topped off by a suicide.

65
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,818
Believe me, Dylan.
You are holding a nonstop ticket

66
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,899
to a place you definitely do not wanna go.

67
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:54,639
l can pull some strings, Dylan.
Save you from a whole world of hurt.

68
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,006
All you have to do is this one last job,
and it'll be over.

69
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,476
l promise.

70
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:11,981
Oh, l mean, l really, really promise
this time.

71
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,554
Good.
l knew you'd see it my way.

72
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,728
As always.

73
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,944
(sighs)

74
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,381
Was it something l said?

75
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,098
Come back.

76
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,303
Come back.

77
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,870
We had a deal. Remember?

78
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,969
That's it.
Yes, that's better.

79
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,071
Short, quick breaths.

80
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,648
Attaboy.

81
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:22,419
Now you're going to do
exactly what l tell you, Dylan.

82
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:27,261
You know why? Because you just had
a brief glimpse of the place you're headed,

83
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,664
and it wasn't pretty, was it?

84
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,461
l didn't think so.

85
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,973
Now. Let's get down
to business, shall we?

86
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,237
She'll be soaping up soon.

87
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,245
Feeling better? OK.

88
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,866
Away from the window.

89
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,667
Sit down.

90
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,741
Not there. There.

91
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,378
Hands on lap.

92
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:24,353
Whatever you're looking for,
you won't find it if l'm dead.

93
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:28,450
l work for a boss who prefers
to extract secrets from corpses.

94
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,428
They tend not to lie so much.

95
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,335
All right.
This is how it works, Allison.

96
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,840
l'm here to kill you.
lt's that simple.

97
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:47,879
l don't know what you're hiding, or why.
l never do.

98
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,381
This is purely a job, an assignment.
Understand?

99
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,679
- Understand?!
- Yes.

100
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,455
For some reason...

101
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,555
l get the feeling you're different.

102
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,101
Like this is all a mistake.

103
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:15,139
Not that it ever mattered before,
but it does.

104
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,210
Somehow it does. lt does matter.
And l don't know why.

105
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,581
lt comes down to this. l need you to tell me
why you're meant to live.

106
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,844
And l need to know right now.

107
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,443
You can't ask me to justify my life to you.

108
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,955
lt's a life.
That should be enough.

109
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:35,789
lt's not enough!
Understand? lt's not enough.

110
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,130
Not if you know...

111
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,330
what's waiting for me on the other side.

112
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:49,567
On the other side.

113
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:55,610
l've been entrusted with something.

114
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,683
What?

115
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,353
lt's a responsibility.

116
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,413
And that's all l can tell you.

117
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,938
Get up.

118
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,414
- Where are we going?
- Just walk.

119
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:01,173
- Who hired you?
- Calls himself Stark.

120
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,908
Except he tells me that's not his real name.

121
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,143
Man or angel?

122
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:09,244
- Man or angel?
- Get in.

123
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,790
- Who does he work for?
- l'm not sure.

124
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,836
- None too choosy about your employers.
- l didn't apply for the job.

125
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,922
(clock chiming)

126
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,005
Where is it, Allison?

127
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,085
Hm?

128
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,124
(grunts)

129
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,040
(sniffing)

130
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,013
So simple-minded.

131
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,069
- Get out.
- Ow!

132
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:18,143
Don't take it out on me just 'cause
you finally had a fit of conscience.

133
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:21,007
We don't have time to play enemies.

134
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:49,907
(speaks Romanian)

135
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,944
- l just need a few things.
- (woman) What are you doing here?

136
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,979
l'm talking to you!

137
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,981
You! What are you doing here?
Huh?

138
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,914
The blond wig, where is it?

139
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,318
The blond wig? You can't just come in here
and take my things.

140
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,255
- Get the hell out of here. Now!
- Da, da, da.

141
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,816
Now! Before l call the police.
Now, Dylan!

142
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,020
(woman continues yelling)

143
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,792
All right,
l'll be out in a minute.

144
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:16,561
(yelling continues in Romanian)

145
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,337
Looks like the latest one.

146
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,440
What are we doing here?

147
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,040
Will you shut up?!

148
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:36,053
- What are you doing?
- Still waiting on the wig.

149
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,591
Waiting on the wig?
This make you happy?

150
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:41,991
Are you happy?

151
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,291
Happy's got nothing to do with it.
Trust me.

152
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,025
And who is your new whore?

153
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,727
Alison, Gabrielle.
Gabrielle, Allison.

154
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,270
Hi.

155
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,465
You look a mess.

156
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,213
You're a real charmer.

157
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,320
What?

158
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:14,383
- (Allison) They're just Gypsies.
- (Dylan) No, they're not.

159
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,531
- Then who are they?
- Thrones.

160
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,293
- How do you know?.
- Gut.

161
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,268
Run!

162
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:21,788
- You still have your gun, right?
- lf l got lucky with the kill shot,

163
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,794
there'd be a dozen more on us in seconds.

164
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:27,696
- What's the kill shot on an angel?
- Right through the third eye.

165
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:31,166
- Third eye?
- The one you use to see God.

166
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,976
- ls he?
- Can't tell.

167
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,918
Go this way.

168
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,257
- What do we do now?.
- Change.

169
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,087
First, put on lots of perfume.
As much as you can stand.

170
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,219
And take at least ten of these pills.

171
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,559
- Why?
- They hunt by taste and smell.

172
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,156
The pills are iron.
They'll change the taste of your blood.

173
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:05,668
The perfume -
most definitely not you.

174
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,864
Do you think
they can be fooled this easily?

175
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,771
To them we're all monkeys.
We all look alike.

176
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,504
What about the thrones?
Do they work for Stark?

177
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:14,977
Yep.

178
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,714
l guess l'm a little rusty
on my celestial hierarchy.

179
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:20,717
You have thrones and powers.
They're heaven's grunts.

180
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,083
Thick, slow-witted,
totally lacking free will.

181
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,588
Not a big threat
if you see them coming first.

182
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,182
Same goes for your dominions and virtues.

183
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,761
The cherubs?
Don't let that Hallmark shit fool you.

184
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:33,831
They'll rip your heart out first
and bless you later.

185
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:37,629
Now, your archs and seraphs.
They're the real deal.

186
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,432
They claim to take their orders
straight from the top.

187
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,406
- Stark?
- Seraph. All the way.

188
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:44,998
Shit!

189
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,543
All right.

190
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:49,614
- Now what?
- This is where we part.

191
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:54,311
- What are you gonna do?
- l'm gonna try and mix it up.

192
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,115
- You're gonna try to find an angel?
- Read your Bible.

193
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,656
Jacob wrestled an angel
for one whole night.

194
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,489
- l'd settle for a good 20 seconds.
- 20 seconds?

195
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,859
That's your head start.
Now get going.

196
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:07,932
That way.

197
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:10,967
Hey.

198
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:14,163
- What's your name?
- Dylan.

199
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,702
lt's a book, Dylan.

200
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,640
A very special book.

201
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,543
lt better be.

202
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,497
Stark wants to see you.
And the girl.

203
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,284
(sniffing)

204
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,197
(shouts in Romanian)

205
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,646
Have a nice day.

206
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,760
You really let me down, Dylan.

207
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,836
But l blame myself,

208
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:28,667
because l never told you
why this job is so important.

209
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,145
So.

210
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:40,211
Let me put this in terms
that a monkey could understand.

211
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,855
The girl that you saved
is going to trigger a genocide,

212
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:48,050
the likes of which
the world has never seen.

213
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,323
And that, my friend, is going
to cause devastating consequences.

214
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,797
Not just for her,
but for your entire kind.

215
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:59,870
You should have killed her
when you had the chance.

216
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,997
But it's not too late to make amends.

217
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:20,719
(Romanian) Wait here.
l'll be just a few minutes.

218
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:28,365
- (breaking glass)
- (baby cries)

219
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,759
Hello?

220
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,327
lt's Allison.

221
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,608
l need to talk to you.

222
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:51,213
l know you're here.

223
00:25:56,187 --> 00:26:00,453
(man) You look remarkably stylish
for a marked woman.

224
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,798
(echoing) How are we sleeping
these nights?

225
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,799
Sleep's not real big
on my to-do list right now.

226
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:20,003
Demagogues, martyrs, schizophrenics,
they all tend to run toward insomnia.

227
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:23,877
Tell me, then.
What do you want?

228
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,576
l want to know who's after me and why.

229
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:31,850
You'd ask the devil himself
to explain the politics of that?

230
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,258
Who better?

231
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,388
You have in your possession a book.

232
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:42,193
lt will not only foretell
the coming of the Antichrist,

233
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,701
but in a matter of hours
it will identify him by name.

234
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:51,265
Now that, Allison, makes you the courier
of a weapon of mass destruction

235
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:55,107
every bit as devastating
as any nuclear bomb.

236
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:57,847
And just as your world governments

237
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,112
fear a nuclear device
falling into the hands of savages,

238
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:02,880
so there are powerful interests in heaven

239
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:06,719
who regard you and that book
with the same concern.

240
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:10,693
The politics of angels, you see,
are not so very different from those of men.

241
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:14,754
Both have rules to follow,
codes of conduct, laws.

242
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:20,003
Both, for example,
have constraints regarding murder,

243
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:23,336
and ways to get around those constraints.

244
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,234
Hired assassins.

245
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:31,304
But it would seem the preferred option
is no longer in play.

246
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:37,286
You have, in the parlance of the ClA,
''turned their chief asset.''

247
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,755
Your new friend,

248
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,826
Dylan.

249
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,631
(sniffing)

250
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,931
So our angel, whosoever he is,

251
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:55,097
has no choice
but to perform this sordid task himself.

252
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,466
Go to ground, so to speak.

253
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:04,145
- l have a weakness for these things.
- Maybe it's the angel food cake.

254
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:08,444
God forbid.

255
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:15,317
l need you to help me.

256
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,528
Are you sure?

257
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,599
You helped me the last time.

258
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,603
l protected you from one of my own
for my own reasons. That's all.

259
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,003
- l thought...
- A word of advice.

260
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:32,008
Don't ever assume you know my motives.

261
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,374
Ever.

262
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,087
Allison.

263
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:47,086
Did you know that
''revelation'' and ''apocalypse''

264
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,922
are the same word in Ancient Greek?

265
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,996
Yes.

266
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,599
Good.

267
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,212
Hey!

268
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,512
(sighs)

269
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:15,677
Shit.

270
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:44,608
God!

271
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:38,754
(recites prayer in Romanian)

272
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,092
(prayercontinues)

273
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,407
(priest chanting)

274
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:10,245
I have a message for you, Allison.

275
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:13,190
(chanting continues)

276
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,485
(chanting continues)

277
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:58,268
Aagh!

278
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,264
Are we clear now?.

279
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:05,638
Why don't you just take her out yourself?.
You already got your hands dirty.

280
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:11,747
(Stark) Because she's in a place
where violence would be unsavory.

281
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,545
Now, if your stomach should fail you again,

282
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:19,783
simply escort her off of church grounds
and we'll handle the rest.

283
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,883
Why me?
Why do l have to do this?

284
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,862
lsn't it obvious?
She trusts you now.

285
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,838
(thunderclap)

286
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,164
Oh, God.

287
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:02,966
(girl whispering)

288
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:23,176
(girl whispers) l'm cold.

289
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,661
(whimpering)

290
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,782
(thunderclap)

291
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:55,379
(girl whispers) l'm cold.

292
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,454
So cold.

293
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,480
(glass shatters)

294
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:56,046
(Allison) Hello?

295
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,335
Hello?

296
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:21,572
ls anybody here?

297
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,549
Who's there?

298
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,727
(speaks in Romanian)

299
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:47,331
(Romanian)

300
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,437
(Romanian)

301
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:06,714
l died for you, Allison...

302
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:11,049
so you could use my funeral
to escape them.

303
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:13,783
Now l have to wait in the cold ground

304
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:17,622
because the bad angels
don't want us in heaven.

305
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,992
- Why?
- They hate us.

306
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:23,692
They want heaven for themselves.

307
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,463
That's why they need the book.

308
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:32,372
Don't give it to them,
even if they tear you apart.

309
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,108
Wait.

310
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,481
Don't go.

311
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:40,550
(birds squawking)

312
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:46,111
(doorcreaks)

313
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:07,506
(man) Allison.

314
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,408
Dylan?

315
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,642
Oh, God.
l'm so scared.

316
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,829
You're hurt.

317
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:36,773
- l'll be all right.
- Your hand...

318
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,741
it's so cold.

319
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,477
How'd you find me, Dylan?

320
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:49,217
They told me you were here.

321
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,532
lf they want me,
they'll get me.

322
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:07,002
l mean, they're not gonna stop.

323
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:09,528
Ever.

324
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:14,035
- Are they?
- No.

325
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,439
No.

326
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:20,642
Glad we got that out of the way.

327
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:33,261
l was surprised to hear you
mention the Bible back there.

328
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:35,059
When?

329
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:39,193
When you were talking about
Jacob fighting the angel.

330
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:43,535
l'm no expert, but l guess you don't find
too many hit men quoting scripture.

331
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:46,132
l wasn't always a hit man.

332
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:55,342
l was a grad student in theology.
University of Chicago.

333
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,586
Three months from a PhD.

334
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,032
You studied theology?

335
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,632
Do you even know
whose side you're on?

336
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:21,438
Or if what you're doing is right?

337
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,209
l don't know.

338
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,479
l mean, l...

339
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:31,453
l think this is where faith comes in.

340
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:36,284
l have a book that alleges to be
the word of God,

341
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:39,055
and l've been chosen to protect it.

342
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,465
Do l really have to know why?

343
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:50,430
l think you always need to know why,
no matter who's doing the asking.

344
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:07,523
- Time to go.
- But aren't we safer in here?

345
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,422
By morning there'll be hundreds.

346
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,894
Just how long do you plan to hold out?
Centuries?

347
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:20,198
- Well, how do we get past them?
- My car's just outside the gate.

348
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:24,206
- When you hear it start up, come running.
- But...

349
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:36,152
(engine starts)

350
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:55,071
(thunderclap)

351
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:13,114
Dylan!

352
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:16,422
Dylan! Dylan!

353
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,856
Dylan!

354
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:20,458
Dylan!

355
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:25,730
(screams) Dylan!

356
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:29,973
No! Dylan!

357
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:36,479
(Allison screams)

358
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,218
Dylan!

359
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,755
Why?

360
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:59,936
(Stark) Welcome to oblivion.

361
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:07,406
l thought you might like a sneak preview
before you take up permanent residence.

362
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:11,311
Don't forget.
l'm an angel, Allison.

363
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:13,246
A seraphim.

364
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,841
l'm on your side.

365
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:18,347
Come on!

366
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:24,451
Tell me Armageddon isn't just about
the worst idea God ever came up with.

367
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:30,124
All that death and damnation
because of one little Antichrist.

368
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:33,601
Even your friend Dylan
finally came around to...

369
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,566
reason.

370
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:42,112
All l want is the last page of the lexicon.

371
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:46,342
- Why do you want it so badly?
- Because, in three hours' time,

372
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:50,784
the name of the child who will
trigger Armageddon will be revealed.

373
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:53,982
We can stop that from coming to pass.

374
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:57,026
''Stop''? As in ''kill''?

375
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:01,323
One child's life versus billions.

376
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:03,593
You do the math.

377
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:23,915
Hey.

378
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:26,253
Uh...

379
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:29,689
You got some kind of stuff
dripping there.

380
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:36,061
Cranial fluid would be my guess.

381
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:39,363
You don't think you ought
to see somebody about that?

382
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,268
You got somebody in mind?

383
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:44,636
lt's your life, buddy.

384
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,510
No, it's not.

385
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,983
You know what l think, Stark?

386
00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:00,384
l think you've got a problem.

387
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:02,925
You know what it is?

388
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:08,693
Please... enlighten me.

389
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:15,194
You hate the fact
that your boss put me up to this.

390
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:19,105
You'd love to kill me.
You'd really get off on ripping me apart.

391
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:20,801
But you're afraid.

392
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:24,077
Afraid?

393
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:27,514
Afraid to have my blood
on your hands.

394
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:32,385
lt's one thing to let
one of your human lackeys do it.

395
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:35,652
There's plenty of deniability there, right?

396
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:39,889
But someone of your stature?
A seraphim?

397
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:46,033
God's right hand? l mean, how's that
gonna look at the next board meeting?

398
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:48,266
(Stark yells)

399
00:46:57,714 --> 00:46:59,875
l don't have to kill you myself.

400
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:04,584
l could whisper a simple suggestion

401
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:08,055
and have you step in front
of a speeding subway train.

402
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:13,360
l could force a neighbor
to hurl you down a flight of stairs.

403
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:26,376
l could put a baby in your belly that would
rip its way out of your womb in three days.

404
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:29,570
Then why don't you?

405
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,944
Because you can't.

406
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:35,348
Because there's something different
about me, isn't there?

407
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:38,114
Something that you can't handle.

408
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:43,691
You're right about
almost everything else,

409
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:48,754
except l will kill you
if l have to.

410
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:55,404
Let's hope it doesn't come to that,
for both our sakes.

411
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,377
lt's a nightmare.

412
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:14,754
A crazy dream.

413
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:18,556
Any minute
you're gonna wake up, Allison.

414
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:23,122
You're gonna wake up
and this whole thing is gonna be over.

415
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,827
Careful, Allison.

416
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:28,598
People might think you're crazy.

417
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:37,312
l love this park.

418
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:41,578
Perverts and lunatics everywhere.
l'm like a kid in a candy store.

419
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:46,853
(Allison) Something tells me you're not
out here trawling for new recruits.

420
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:51,023
Who knows?
Maybe l'm trawling for you.

421
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:56,357
l trust you got my message?
The one from the little girl?

422
00:48:57,334 --> 00:49:00,360
(Allison) You didn't have to kill her.

423
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:03,303
She was going to die anyway.
Eventually.

424
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:08,436
l need to know whose side l'm on.

425
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:12,312
l would think a person of faith
never has to ask that question.

426
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,611
l'm asking now.

427
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:18,080
You're a Jesuit scholar.

428
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:20,383
And so close to your doctorate, too.

429
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:24,224
Let's see
if it's all been worth the effort.

430
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:27,024
What was the title
of your dissertation again?

431
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,997
The Role of Warfare
in Modern Religion.

432
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,001
Ah. A subject very dear to my heart.

433
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:37,005
So... let's go straight to
a personal favorite.

434
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:39,541
Armageddon.

435
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,703
Doomsday, as you call it.

436
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:46,772
- Stark wants to prevent it.
- Yes, but why?

437
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:48,942
l'm asking myself the same question.

438
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:52,112
Think.
What follows Armageddon?

439
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:54,520
The restoration of the faithful
to God's side.

440
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:59,027
So why would certain angels
not want to see that happen?

441
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:02,262
Oh, come on, Allison.

442
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:06,097
God gave you the gift of reason.
Use it.

443
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:09,764
- Jealousy.
- Of whom?

444
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:13,775
Jealousy of those humans
who survive Armageddon.

445
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,642
Jealous that they'll be
the chosen ones,

446
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:21,548
the ones to restore humanity,
the ones most loved by God.

447
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:25,883
Loved even more
than the angels themselves.

448
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:29,186
So Stark's not interested in saving
the lives of billions of people.

449
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:32,625
- He just wants us all...
- Doing what you do best.

450
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:36,756
Degrading yourselves
in the eyes of your Lord.

451
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,700
- So that just leaves you, doesn't it?
- Mm.

452
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:44,433
- What's your agenda?
- Oh, l think you know what l want.

453
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:50,368
Of course.
You want Armageddon.

454
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,883
You get to snatch up
whoever doesn't make the final cut.

455
00:50:57,187 --> 00:51:01,715
A billion corrupt new souls
dancing on my doorstep.

456
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:06,125
Hell looks to be a very busy place
in the next few years.

457
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:12,795
So by protecting the lexicon,
l'm doing the devil's work. Aren't l?

458
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:17,935
Sometimes the interests of heaven
and hell are not so very different, Allison.

459
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:20,672
Get used to it.

460
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:27,173
l'm still on my lunch break.

461
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:29,548
Which lasts how long, precisely?

462
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:33,612
A couple of days, or until l fall apart -
whichever comes first.

463
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:40,857
The girl has proven to be more...
difficult to crack than l anticipated.

464
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:44,627
Sweating her didn't do the trick, huh?
What a surprise.

465
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:47,464
Now l need one small favor from you.

466
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:49,539
And then you can go ahead

467
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:53,302
and take that nice, long dirt nap
that you've been pining for.

468
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:55,708
What do you want from me,
Stark, huh?

469
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:58,804
l just fucking betrayed her for you.

470
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:03,843
But you love that, don't you?
Watching what we do to each other.

471
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:09,458
lt's the only way
you can still feel superior, isn't it?

472
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:13,930
This shit don't even
make me drunk anymore.

473
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:17,464
Think back.

474
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:20,900
You watched her get up, shower,
feed the pigeons. Then what?

475
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:23,802
l don't know. She'd leave for an hour
or two, usually around noon.

476
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:24,931
- To go where?
- Park.

477
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:27,771
- Which one, specifically?
- Does it matter?

478
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:30,745
(Stark) Yeah, a dog never wanders far
from where it buried its bone.

479
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:36,513
Same with people. She'll check her hiding
spot daily to make sure it's still secure.

480
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:14,914
- (Romanian) You're one of them.
- Huh?

481
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:20,086
(Romanian)

482
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:56,055
(man) You're not through yet.
It's time to fight back, Allison.

483
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:49,619
(groans)

484
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,123
(Stark) This one's vacant.

485
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:07,169
No.

486
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:09,363
(Stark) Owner died last year.
Nasty fall.

487
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:12,066
- (Dylan) Was that your doing?
- l don't do accidents.

488
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,487
She's been here.

489
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,998
Open it.

490
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,415
Faster.

491
00:55:55,518 --> 00:56:00,217
- You try it with no feeling in your fingertips.
- l don't do grunt work.

492
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,188
(moans)

493
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:11,282
''And in the last days,
the earth beast shall become known.''

494
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:14,830
''His name is Mykael Paun

495
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:19,300
and he shall bear four
distinct marks upon his face.''

496
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:21,394
(doorcreaks)

497
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,519
(creaking)

498
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:57,800
(sniffs)

499
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:07,868
You can't hide from me, Allison.

500
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,506
(sniffs)

501
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:13,741
l can smell you.

502
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:39,273
(sniffs)

503
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,523
(moans)

504
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:29,456
Just the last page, Allison.

505
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:31,652
That's all l want.

506
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,573
Don't play games with me, Allison.

507
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:53,132
(yells)

508
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:12,623
Agh!

509
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:27,176
He's here, you know.

510
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:33,442
The child that will one day
destroy your world is right here -

511
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:35,975
in this city.

512
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:40,681
We are so close.

513
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:44,655
All we need is the book
to find out who he is,

514
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,093
then this can all be over.

515
01:02:56,672 --> 01:03:00,972
- lt's about time, Dylan.
- Dylan. What did he do to you?

516
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:03,511
(Stark) lt's what he did to himself.

517
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:11,109
Do you still wonder, Allison,
why you were chosen,

518
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,188
and for what purpose?

519
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:18,056
l mean, taking your cues from Satan,
that's a bit risky, isn't it?

520
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:24,893
Come on over here, Dylan.
You might find this interesting.

521
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:28,596
Here we have this delicate young thing

522
01:03:28,704 --> 01:03:34,665
who, for some inexplicable reason,
seems to have a very hard time dying.

523
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:37,041
Look at yourself, Allison.

524
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:40,138
Don't you find it a wee bit odd
that you're still standing,

525
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:42,274
after all you've been through?

526
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:45,548
You are familiar with
the term ''nephilim''?

527
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:49,255
No.

528
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:52,691
- l can't be...
- Child.

529
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:57,095
Born of an angel in a woman -
half of each, but belonging to neither.

530
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,363
lt's an incredibly lonely existence.

531
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:03,632
- lsn't it, Allison?
- You're lying.

532
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:06,207
You were sired
by an angel named Simon

533
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:09,904
who believed that you'd make
an ideal guardian of the book.

534
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:12,708
- l don't believe you.
- Think about it.

535
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:18,378
The resilience of an angel
and the resourcefulness of a monkey.

536
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:25,826
You know, l have to admit,
there is a perverse logic to it.

537
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:29,386
You were bred as a tool
of certain parties in interest in heaven.

538
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:32,160
Nothing more, Allison.
Just a tool.

539
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:35,203
You know when l told you
to shoot her in the head, Dylan?

540
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:38,432
l had my reasons.
lt's the only way she can die.

541
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:43,171
Short of ripping out her heart, of course.
That would be messy.

542
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:46,748
So go ahead.
Do the honors.

543
01:04:48,684 --> 01:04:53,018
Go ahead.
Right in the sweet spot.

544
01:04:53,689 --> 01:04:57,090
And then it's done.
You're off the hook. Finito.

545
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:00,963
Promise?

546
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:04,931
You have my word on it.
Swear to God.

547
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:09,395
Don't do it.
Whatever he's told you is a lie.

548
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:11,473
He doesn't call the shots.

549
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:15,066
And what about you?
Are you a lying nephilim?

550
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:16,269
Hm?

551
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:20,909
Look inside that shapeless thing
that you call a soul

552
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:24,043
and show us the truth, please.

553
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:30,549
Come on, Dylan.

554
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:35,188
You save a few billion lives, and you
spare yourself the fiery depths of hell.

555
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:39,029
lf you act right now, l'll even throw
in a nice shiny gold merit badge.

556
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:42,002
Now, what's not to like here?

557
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:47,299
You've defied him once, Dylan.

558
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:51,506
There must have been a reason.

559
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,582
Aagh!

560
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:58,647
Right. You're gonna shoot me now?.
Human sentiment!

561
01:05:58,754 --> 01:06:02,121
That's really precious.
That's really, really precious, Dylan.

562
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:05,125
(Allison) We have to protect the book.

563
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:09,323
lt's ours to protect.
We just have to believe, Dylan.

564
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:13,398
lt's not up to us to second-guess God.

565
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:17,097
All we have to do is believe.
That's it.

566
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:20,198
Shoot the girl and take the book.

567
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:23,134
Shoot the girl and take the book.

568
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,505
Shoot the girl and take the book!

569
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:29,983
How much simpler
do l have to make it?!

570
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:33,615
All right! l get it.

571
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:39,156
One easy shot in the head.

572
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,657
No!

573
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:14,694
(screams)

574
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:20,702
No!

575
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:25,131
(exasperated screaming)

576
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:44,690
(wailing)

577
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:40,641
(gasps)

578
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:54,329
Simon.

579
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:12,441
You can't imagine
what lies in store for you.

580
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:18,553
And to think of all the good times
l'll be missing.

581
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:02,797
(woman) Mykael!

582
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:05,767
Mykael!

583
01:17:23,555 --> 01:32:05,107
