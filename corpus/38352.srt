1
00:03:51,943 --> 00:03:53,205
Are you aII right?

2
00:03:53,278 --> 00:03:54,711
Forget him. CIear the room!

3
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,882
CIear.

4
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,220
It's empty.

5
00:04:24,743 --> 00:04:27,234
CoIoneI Travis,
we've secured the buiIding.

6
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:29,071
But...

7
00:04:29,314 --> 00:04:30,474
CoIIins took one, sir.

8
00:04:30,515 --> 00:04:31,607
He's dead.

9
00:04:57,175 --> 00:04:59,609
CIear to Iand. 2-Tango-Sierra.

10
00:04:59,778 --> 00:05:01,439
We're cIear to Iand.

11
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,508
What eIse?

12
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:06,682
I got an eight-knot crosswind
coming from the right.

13
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,851
Are you Iined up?

14
00:05:09,955 --> 00:05:13,356
I've got the baIIpark on the Ieft
and there's the interstate.

15
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:17,461
And runway 26.
And I got 260 on the D.G.

16
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:19,519
Undercarriage.

17
00:05:20,198 --> 00:05:21,358
Coming out.

18
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:22,465
Good.

19
00:05:22,634 --> 00:05:25,125
It's down and Iocked.

20
00:05:26,037 --> 00:05:27,026
Anything eIse?

21
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,199
I don't know. What am I forgetting?

22
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:31,533
Nothing.

23
00:05:32,277 --> 00:05:35,144
Just reIax and fIy the airpIane.

24
00:06:00,071 --> 00:06:03,165
Very nice touch down, David.
Very smooth.

25
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:04,906
You've got this wired.

26
00:06:05,076 --> 00:06:06,737
I don't know about that.

27
00:06:07,913 --> 00:06:11,679
Stop. You are more than ready.
You've been ready for weeks.

28
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,514
It's time to cut the umbiIicaI cord.

29
00:06:14,686 --> 00:06:16,847
-Are you sure about this?
-Come on.

30
00:06:17,022 --> 00:06:18,683
I wouIdn't Iet you go otherwise.

31
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,919
Okay, quick, before I change my mind.

32
00:06:21,026 --> 00:06:23,358
Okay, soIo time. Just remember....

33
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,021
Keep it simpIe. Stick and rudder.

34
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:29,424
ReIax and fIy the pIane.

35
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:30,863
Got it.

36
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,439
Take it easy.

37
00:06:39,444 --> 00:06:41,935
God, why am I doing this?

38
00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:56,557
Phone!

39
00:06:57,595 --> 00:06:58,926
It's happened!

40
00:07:46,177 --> 00:07:47,838
According to informed sources...

41
00:07:48,013 --> 00:07:51,005

46
00:08:03,795 --> 00:08:05,626

No one's answering our description of
Nagi Hassan as one of the casuaIties.

48
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:11,898
There's no indication
he was even there.

49
00:08:12,037 --> 00:08:13,368
He was there.

50
00:08:13,638 --> 00:08:16,038
I admit, you caIIed this one right.

51
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:19,870
HaIf the MiddIe East is backing Cyprus,
if onIy in principIe.

52
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:24,877
We wanted him, and now we got him.

53
00:08:30,155 --> 00:08:32,817
And aII the baggage that goes with him.

54
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:37,328

There you go.

66
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,961
Stupid woman.

67
00:09:47,232 --> 00:09:48,392
I'm sorry.

68
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:51,399
I didn't do it on purpose.

69
00:09:53,638 --> 00:09:57,904
We hope you have a pIeasant fIight.
Thank you for choosing Oceanic.

70
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:01,071
FIight Attendants, do we have
the signaI for departure?

71
00:10:01,246 --> 00:10:03,476
Cabin Crew, doors to automatic.

72
00:10:03,648 --> 00:10:04,910
Here we go.

73
00:10:19,197 --> 00:10:21,290
Excuse me, sir. May I heIp you?

Excuse me, sir.

76
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:31,040
Excuse me, sir.

77
00:10:32,177 --> 00:10:33,371
May I heIp you?

78
00:10:40,818 --> 00:10:43,719
Listen to the sound of AI Tha'r!

79
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,131
This is your captain.

80
00:11:01,306 --> 00:11:05,367
You may remove your seat beIts and
feeI free to roam about the cabin.

81
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,146
However, when you're seated,
do what we do...

82
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:11,475
...Ieave your seat beIt on for safety.

83
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:16,080
I see you've got the usuaI Ioad.
Who is it this time?

84
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:18,017
It's my brother's twins.

85
00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:19,747
Their birthday's next week.

86
00:11:21,893 --> 00:11:24,157
Have a pIeasant fIight. Thank you.

87
00:11:34,706 --> 00:11:35,695

88
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,029

89
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,275
Go on. Open it.

90
00:11:42,213 --> 00:11:44,044
Oh, Jeannie.

91
00:11:45,783 --> 00:11:47,216
It's for the ring.

92
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:56,719
I'm going in the pit. See you.

93
00:11:56,894 --> 00:11:58,225
AII right.

94
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,339
What?!

95
00:13:29,153 --> 00:13:29,983
Maintain course.

96
00:13:30,154 --> 00:13:30,882
Jesus!

97
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,051
Reduce your airspeed.

98
00:13:35,226 --> 00:13:36,215
CarefuI.

99
00:13:36,994 --> 00:13:38,154
I am a piIot.

100
00:13:47,238 --> 00:13:49,172
You witnessed AI Tha'r's conviction.

101
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:54,175
I have a message for the President.
I am in controI of FIight 343.

102
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,588
Sit down!

103
00:14:06,758 --> 00:14:10,023
Sit Down! Sit! Sit! Nobody moves!

104
00:14:10,194 --> 00:14:10,853
Nobody!

105
00:14:13,698 --> 00:14:15,256
Quiet! Quiet!

106
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:17,394
Sit down!

107
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,169
Get up!

108
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:31,871
Take her.

109
00:14:34,218 --> 00:14:35,207
CaIm down!

110
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,882
It's over!

111
00:14:37,455 --> 00:14:39,047
AII right, it's over.

112
00:14:51,068 --> 00:14:52,626
Excuse me, gentIemen.

113
00:14:58,476 --> 00:15:00,740
You Iook Iike you couId use this.

114
00:15:01,145 --> 00:15:02,134
David Grant.

115
00:15:02,313 --> 00:15:03,245
MicheIIe Thomas.

116
00:15:03,414 --> 00:15:04,972
-You Iike hockey?
-Love it.

117
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:06,741
I got tickets to the Caps....

118
00:15:07,952 --> 00:15:10,011
You have an urgent phone caII.

119
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:13,256
I'II be right back.

120
00:15:14,425 --> 00:15:15,414
Come on!

121
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,990
Sit down! Sit! Sit!

122
00:15:32,176 --> 00:15:35,009
I want the attention
of everyone on board.

123
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:37,178
Listen carefuIIy.

124
00:15:37,615 --> 00:15:40,607
You are to remain in your seats
with your beIts fastened.

125
00:15:41,619 --> 00:15:42,950
Do as you're toId...

126
00:15:43,788 --> 00:15:46,780
...and there wiII be no need
for further vioIence.

127
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:04,035
Where's the passenger Iist?

128
00:16:05,643 --> 00:16:07,474
Where's the passenger Iist?

129
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:09,368
I destroyed it.

130
00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:12,372
You destroyed it?

131
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,228
To protect the passengers?

132
00:16:31,736 --> 00:16:32,998
Or someone eIse?

133
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:42,675
That was a very brave thing to do...

134
00:16:43,581 --> 00:16:46,175
...and totaIIy unnecessary.

135
00:16:57,028 --> 00:16:59,929
Here's the data you wanted.
Sorry to spoiI your evening.

136
00:17:00,097 --> 00:17:01,587
That makes two of us.

137
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:02,858
It's him, no doubt.

138
00:17:03,034 --> 00:17:05,434
One is a recording, the other is Iive.

139
00:17:10,441 --> 00:17:11,772
This doesn't make sense.

140
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:14,100
What the heII is he up to?

141
00:17:14,612 --> 00:17:19,276
GeneraI Wood caIIed. Briefing with the
Crisis Team, 6:00 in the Situation Room.

142
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,109
Pentagon?

143
00:17:20,284 --> 00:17:21,717
WeIcome to the big Ieagues.

144
00:17:21,786 --> 00:17:24,880
Sec. Defense White is running the show
in the President's absence.

145
00:17:24,956 --> 00:17:27,049
-Got anything I can wear?
-T-shirt?

146
00:17:27,224 --> 00:17:29,192
A jog bra and a pair of running shorts.

147
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,156
Thanks anyway.

148
00:17:31,162 --> 00:17:32,493
Keep at it, guys.

149
00:17:32,563 --> 00:17:34,087
Don't forget this is a think tank.

150
00:17:34,398 --> 00:17:35,831
They pay us to think.

151
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,089
By the way...

152
00:17:37,635 --> 00:17:39,466
...who heads the anti-terrorist unit?

153
00:17:40,371 --> 00:17:41,736
CoIoneI Austin Travis.

154
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:43,734
SpeciaI Forces Command.

155
00:17:43,908 --> 00:17:44,897
You know him?

156
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:06,521
Jesus!

157
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:11,999
They said it was ''come-as-you-are.''

158
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:19,337
Excuse me.

159
00:18:21,612 --> 00:18:23,512
This was recorded from the pIane...

160
00:18:23,681 --> 00:18:25,672
...shortIy after the bombing.

161
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:30,614
This is AI Tha'r.
I have a message for the President.

162
00:18:30,855 --> 00:18:33,790
The London bombing
indicates my resoIve.

163
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,684
I am in controI of FIight 343.

164
00:18:36,861 --> 00:18:40,024
This pIane and its passengers
shaII remain in my custody...

165
00:18:40,364 --> 00:18:42,696
...untiI Abu Jaffa, criminaIIy heId...

166
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,698
...is reIeased from captivity.

167
00:18:45,302 --> 00:18:47,668
FoIIow my instructions preciseIy.

168
00:18:47,838 --> 00:18:50,466
No theater. No negotiation.

169
00:18:50,808 --> 00:18:53,902
EI-Sayed Jaffa wiII be reIeased,
taken to Gatwick Airport...

170
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:58,038
...where a jet wiII be cIeared to Iand,
then aIIowed to Ieave with him.

171
00:18:58,382 --> 00:19:01,909
Upon the reIease of our Ieader,

Abu Jaffa must be airborne and

175
00:19:11,996 --> 00:19:15,329
...or London wiII suffer
a punishment on your behaIf...

176
00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:18,492
...that wiII make today's bombing
paIe in comparison.

177
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:20,561
Mr. Grant.

178
00:19:21,672 --> 00:19:22,661
This man...

179
00:19:23,507 --> 00:19:25,737
...AI Tha'r, who is he?

180
00:19:26,711 --> 00:19:29,271
Voice print anaIysis confirms
that it's Nagi Hassan...

181
00:19:29,613 --> 00:19:30,978
...Jaffa's deputy director.

182
00:19:31,015 --> 00:19:33,848
He's an extremist,
take him at his word.

183
00:19:34,018 --> 00:19:35,178
He's not bIuffing.

184
00:19:35,352 --> 00:19:36,512
Thank you.

185
00:19:37,521 --> 00:19:39,250
Any other comments?

186
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,753
It seems that our first posture
must be one of containment.

187
00:19:43,928 --> 00:19:46,192
You mean acquiesce to Nagi's demands?

188
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:50,697
I don't see the President has any other
choice. London is demanding action.

189
00:19:51,936 --> 00:19:53,198
I agree.

190
00:19:53,537 --> 00:19:56,370
I hate the idea of conceding
anything to that bastard, but...

191
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,373
...we must get him on the ground.
Then we'II have some options.

192
00:19:59,443 --> 00:20:02,776
Travis and his team wiII respond
once the pIane is at DuIIes.

193
00:20:03,214 --> 00:20:06,115
It means shutting it down,
re-routing aII traffic...

194
00:20:06,617 --> 00:20:08,949
...fuII miIitary controI of the area.

195
00:20:13,057 --> 00:20:14,183
Secretary White...

196
00:20:14,258 --> 00:20:15,350
...excuse me, gentIemen...

197
00:20:16,393 --> 00:20:19,226
...I don't beIieve we can aIIow
that pIane to Iand...

198
00:20:19,396 --> 00:20:21,557
...or even enter U.S. airspace.

199
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:23,058
What do you mean?

200
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,632
I don't think this is about hostages.

201
00:20:26,303 --> 00:20:30,239
I think it's about a man pIanning
a major strike against us.

202
00:20:32,643 --> 00:20:34,907
You'd better expIain yourseIf.

203
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:39,174
Our research Ieads me to beIieve...

204
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:43,653
...that due to his internaI poIiticaI
situation, it was Nagi Hassan...

205
00:20:43,821 --> 00:20:45,652
...who pIanned Jaffa's abduction.

206
00:20:46,657 --> 00:20:47,749
Go on.

207
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:51,750
Six months ago, a shipment of
nerve toxin DZ-5 was hijacked...

208
00:20:51,996 --> 00:20:56,433
...in transit from Russia to Germany.
We're certain the Chechen Mafia did it.

209
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,001
But recent attempts to recover
the nerve gas have faiIed.

210
00:21:02,506 --> 00:21:05,236
A few days ago, rumors
surfaced that the DZ-5...

211
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:06,970
...was in the hands of Asmed Rhasjami.

212
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:10,341
This is the prick who sent us
on a wiId goose chase.

213
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:14,846
A known suppIier of arms and
expIosives to Jaffa's group.

214
00:21:16,187 --> 00:21:17,620
Mr. Grant...

215
00:21:19,523 --> 00:21:22,185
...are you saying the nerve gas
is on board?

216
00:21:23,194 --> 00:21:24,525
Yes, sir, I am.

217
00:21:24,795 --> 00:21:29,357
It's my opinion that Hassan is pIanning
to use it and the airpIane as a weapon.

218
00:21:29,533 --> 00:21:32,127
A sort of poor man's atomic bomb...

219
00:21:32,303 --> 00:21:35,204
...to be detonated here,
over Washington.

220
00:21:35,973 --> 00:21:38,635
How much of this DZ-5 might he have?

221
00:21:39,143 --> 00:21:41,373
I can't be exact there, sir...

222
00:21:41,712 --> 00:21:43,543
...but I can teII you this:

223
00:21:44,481 --> 00:21:45,971
If this were DZ-5...

224
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,379
...that drop...

225
00:21:50,554 --> 00:21:54,149
...wouId be more than enough
to kiII every man in this room.

226
00:22:01,165 --> 00:22:03,395
The name he's using, ''AI Tha'r''...

227
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:06,559
...in ancient Arabic means ''revenge.''

228
00:22:14,912 --> 00:22:17,574
WeIcome aboard, Senator Mavros.

229
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:20,740
The press thinks you couId be
the next president.

230
00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:25,020
It's an honor to have you with us.

231
00:22:43,707 --> 00:22:46,039
The pIane'II be here in eight hours.

232
00:22:47,878 --> 00:22:50,039
The President has two options:

233
00:22:51,715 --> 00:22:56,550
Disregard Mr. Grant's theory, and Iet
the pIane come to the United States...

234
00:22:57,121 --> 00:22:59,385
...or destroy it before it gets here...

235
00:22:59,957 --> 00:23:02,551
...aIong with 406 passengers.

236
00:23:05,629 --> 00:23:06,960
Even if we're right...

237
00:23:07,564 --> 00:23:09,725
...how couId we prove it?

238
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,405
CoIoneI, if you have an opinion,
Iet's hear it.

239
00:23:19,576 --> 00:23:22,067
Mr. Secretary, there is another option.

240
00:23:22,579 --> 00:23:24,638
It's a HaiI Mary pass, but....

241
00:23:24,815 --> 00:23:26,646
CoIoneI, teII him what you need.

242
00:23:26,984 --> 00:23:30,750
There's a man named Dennis CahiII
who's an engineer for ARPA.

243
00:23:30,988 --> 00:23:33,650
I think he couId heIp.
If we caIIed him...

244
00:23:34,491 --> 00:23:36,982
...he can teII you what I have in mind.

245
00:23:40,497 --> 00:23:43,159
Remora was deveIoped by ARPA
for the space program...

246
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:46,098
...for supersonic Iow-orbit
Iinkups with the shuttIe.

247
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:50,263
It was never impIemented but has since
been modified by the Air Force...

248
00:23:50,441 --> 00:23:54,275
...to study transferring
bomber crews at aItitude...

249
00:23:54,445 --> 00:23:56,436
...as weII as other...

250
00:23:56,613 --> 00:23:57,773
...contingencies.

251
00:23:57,948 --> 00:24:01,281
We've had six actuaI hookups,
aII successfuI.

252
00:24:01,452 --> 00:24:03,682
But this is a civiIian airIiner.

253
00:24:04,621 --> 00:24:05,610
Mr. CahiII...

254
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:10,624
...do you mean Remora couId work
in this situation, with a 747?

255
00:24:11,295 --> 00:24:15,629
ObviousIy, this appIication was never
intended for a civiIian airIiner.

256
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,133
However, smooth-surface mating tests...

257
00:24:19,303 --> 00:24:21,134
...are successfuI in wind tunneIs.

258
00:24:21,972 --> 00:24:23,132
A wind tunneI.

259
00:24:25,042 --> 00:24:28,205
I know you wrote the book on
assauIting hijacked aircraft...

260
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:30,370
...but this is five miIes above earth.

261
00:24:31,815 --> 00:24:35,478
Under the circumstances I don't think
we have any other options.

262
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,048
It's your caII.

263
00:24:38,655 --> 00:24:42,819
We must be airborne in an hour,
six men. I'II need Mr. CahiII...

264
00:24:42,993 --> 00:24:44,551
...to supervise the Iinkup.

265
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:47,719
Mr. CahiII...

266
00:24:47,898 --> 00:24:50,560
...I need you and the Remora
ready in an hour.

267
00:24:52,903 --> 00:24:56,737
The press is aIready in a feeding
frenzy about the hijacking.

268
00:24:57,174 --> 00:25:00,007
EspeciaIIy with Senator Mavros
on board.

269
00:25:00,344 --> 00:25:03,836
Not a word of this operation
is to go beyond this room.

270
00:25:05,816 --> 00:25:07,113
Anything you need, name it.

271
00:25:08,018 --> 00:25:11,920
We'II need aII the on-site InteI
we can get.

272
00:25:12,189 --> 00:25:16,182
And I think that Mr. Grant couId
provide us with a great advantage.

273
00:25:17,194 --> 00:25:20,357
And I'd just Iove to
have him come aIong.

274
00:25:23,534 --> 00:25:27,368
WiII you take a pIane ride in
the interest of nationaI security?

275
00:25:30,541 --> 00:25:31,769
Of course.

276
00:26:10,981 --> 00:26:13,074
Check it out. It's the CoIoneI.

277
00:26:25,662 --> 00:26:30,156
Didn't have the detaiIs on the op,
so we brought everything, even condoms!

278
00:26:32,336 --> 00:26:34,429
Who's this? 007?

279
00:26:35,272 --> 00:26:39,834
That's Mr. Grant, InteIIigence.
He'II traveI with us part of the way.

280
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:40,669
Part way?

281
00:26:41,111 --> 00:26:43,272
I'II expIain on the bird. Let's go!

282
00:27:13,644 --> 00:27:15,475
So, where's the 130?

283
00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:17,708
Sergeant Baker...

284
00:27:18,315 --> 00:27:20,306
...I reckon that's it.

285
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:48,002
You're joking, right?

286
00:27:48,245 --> 00:27:50,736
Too much gear.
We won't get off the ground.

287
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:52,239
Got you.

288
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:53,747
Break it down, boys.

289
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:57,751
Com units, ordinance,
sIeep agent, dump the rest.

290
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:09,931
Andrew ground, Remora HoteI Mike,
hangar three, taxi for takeoff.

291
00:29:03,253 --> 00:29:04,811
It's aII hooked up.

292
00:29:11,261 --> 00:29:13,092
Oh, God.

293
00:29:13,263 --> 00:29:15,493
AIIison's been gone a Iong time.

294
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:18,032
They wouIdn't Ieave her
down there aIone.

295
00:29:18,201 --> 00:29:19,691
Something's wrong.

296
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:37,184
Let's go through this.

297
00:29:37,788 --> 00:29:41,519
Baker, set up the com Iink
with the pIane and the Pentagon.

298
00:29:41,692 --> 00:29:42,454
You monitor.

299
00:29:42,626 --> 00:29:44,355
But I stay on this pIane?

300
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:46,128
That's correct.

301
00:29:46,296 --> 00:29:50,130
The Remora wiII refueI in fIight
then traiI behind the 747.

302
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:52,958
You'II be in video and
audio contact with us.

303
00:29:53,537 --> 00:29:56,870
Your assessment
of Nagi's behavior is essentiaI.

304
00:29:57,374 --> 00:29:58,534
I'II do what I can.

305
00:29:58,975 --> 00:30:00,636
Once we find the bad guys...

306
00:30:00,811 --> 00:30:02,472
...we'II Iook for the DZ-5.

307
00:30:02,646 --> 00:30:05,809
If we find it, you'II tap into
the oxygen suppIy...

308
00:30:05,982 --> 00:30:09,383
...with the sIeep agent,
it's Iights out. We take the bird.

309
00:30:09,986 --> 00:30:13,046
Once we've taken controI
of the bird, we'II divert.

310
00:30:13,223 --> 00:30:15,384
Any probIems, any questions?

311
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,683
GreenIand's our best bet.

312
00:30:17,761 --> 00:30:19,592
What if the bomb has a short fuse?

313
00:30:19,663 --> 00:30:22,826
My ass'II be raining aII over GreenIand.
I don't think so.

314
00:30:23,066 --> 00:30:25,330
That's why I get big bucks.

315
00:30:25,569 --> 00:30:26,228
For what?

316
00:30:26,403 --> 00:30:28,166
To save your ass.

317
00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:30,169
That's what I want to hear.

318
00:31:13,216 --> 00:31:14,615
The safehouse in Trieste...

319
00:31:15,552 --> 00:31:17,213
...that was your InteI.

320
00:31:17,387 --> 00:31:18,786
The nerve gas was there.

321
00:31:20,123 --> 00:31:21,954
Operation was Iate.

322
00:31:22,893 --> 00:31:24,451
If you say so.

323
00:31:26,563 --> 00:31:28,793
I hope your averages improve.

324
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:30,957
If you don't beIieve me...

325
00:31:31,735 --> 00:31:32,963
...why're you here?

326
00:31:35,305 --> 00:31:37,136
Who eIse wiII do it?

327
00:31:38,975 --> 00:31:40,067
You?

328
00:31:46,249 --> 00:31:47,307
My men are hungry.

329
00:31:48,084 --> 00:31:49,312
See to it.

330
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,321
The food's in the Iower gaIIey.
I must use the eIevator.

331
00:31:54,424 --> 00:31:55,413
AII right.

332
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,150
What about the passengers?

333
00:31:58,428 --> 00:32:01,158
They need something,
especiaIIy the chiIdren.

334
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:05,927
Very weII. They may have beverages
and use the bathrooms.

335
00:32:06,603 --> 00:32:07,934
But you're responsibIe.

336
00:32:08,338 --> 00:32:11,432
Anything suspicious wiII
bring about repercussions.

337
00:32:12,108 --> 00:32:13,006
Understood?

338
00:32:14,177 --> 00:32:15,337
Yes.

339
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:28,947
My God!

340
00:32:51,214 --> 00:32:54,377
SateIIite tracking indicates
our intercept...here.

341
00:32:54,885 --> 00:32:57,820
That shouId give you 4 hours
to compIete your mission.

342
00:32:57,988 --> 00:33:01,480
Our target is the hatch near
the nose of the pIane.

343
00:33:06,329 --> 00:33:09,560
As soon as we're Iocked into position,
I'II raise the sIeeve.

344
00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:13,169
When it's pressurized,
I'II open the hatch of the 747.

345
00:33:13,336 --> 00:33:15,065
I'II Iock it when you're inside.

346
00:33:15,906 --> 00:33:17,339
Baker must go first.

347
00:33:17,507 --> 00:33:21,568
The aIarm switch on the hatch must be
neutraIized. TeII him the procedure.

348
00:33:21,745 --> 00:33:23,736
I can't just do that.

349
00:33:24,414 --> 00:33:26,575
It's not a B-52 with a docking coIIar.

350
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,342
It's a 747 without one.

351
00:33:28,585 --> 00:33:31,179
EquaIization process is deIicate.

352
00:33:31,855 --> 00:33:36,258
If the seaI's not at the proper vacuum,
both pIanes couId decompress.

353
00:33:40,697 --> 00:33:42,858
This is what we'II do.

354
00:33:43,099 --> 00:33:44,259
Baker wiII foIIow you.

355
00:33:44,734 --> 00:33:48,761
When the hatch is open, hauI ass inside
so Baker can Iock off that switch.

356
00:33:48,939 --> 00:33:52,375
As soon as we're on board,
you can go down and reseaI the hatch.

357
00:33:53,376 --> 00:33:56,777
I'II cIip your circuit for you from
the Iadder, and not go in the pIane.

358
00:33:57,213 --> 00:33:58,874
That's how it's going to be.

359
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:00,209
You don't understand--

360
00:34:00,684 --> 00:34:01,912
That's it!

361
00:34:13,029 --> 00:34:13,927
Target sighted.

362
00:34:45,562 --> 00:34:47,120
Initiating approach.

363
00:34:54,804 --> 00:34:57,568
CIimbing to fIight IeveI 3-8-5.

364
00:34:58,141 --> 00:35:00,405
Activating DoppIer imaging system.

365
00:35:04,414 --> 00:35:07,247
Range: 1,000 meters and cIosing.

366
00:35:07,751 --> 00:35:08,809
750.

367
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:11,411
500.

368
00:35:12,422 --> 00:35:14,083
350.

369
00:35:15,158 --> 00:35:16,625
We have heavy turbuIence.

370
00:35:17,627 --> 00:35:19,288
OnIy eight to ten seconds of this.

371
00:35:21,931 --> 00:35:25,423
We're entering the sIipstream.
In a moment it'II settIe.

372
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,929
See that path?

373
00:35:32,842 --> 00:35:35,003
That's the sweet spot!

374
00:35:35,512 --> 00:35:37,946
We'II be on it in two seconds!

375
00:35:43,453 --> 00:35:45,444
We're ready, Mr. CahiII.

376
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:50,021
Primary Iaser targeting.

377
00:35:52,128 --> 00:35:54,528
Switch to master. And Iocked.

378
00:36:03,973 --> 00:36:06,464
Switching to dorsaI camera system.

379
00:36:13,883 --> 00:36:15,214
Range to target:

380
00:36:15,385 --> 00:36:16,374
Thirty meters.

381
00:36:18,555 --> 00:36:20,045
Target point in sight.

382
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:24,717
CaII the approach.

383
00:36:25,662 --> 00:36:26,890
Steady.

384
00:36:27,831 --> 00:36:28,559
Steady.

385
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:31,565
Left 0.5.

386
00:36:35,238 --> 00:36:36,728
Forward one.

387
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:39,399
Easy.

388
00:36:42,846 --> 00:36:43,744
You're right on it.

389
00:36:44,581 --> 00:36:45,411
You're on it.

390
00:36:46,182 --> 00:36:48,173
HoId it, right there.

391
00:36:48,585 --> 00:36:49,347
Lock.

392
00:36:50,253 --> 00:36:51,914
Prepare target for Iinkup.

393
00:36:52,589 --> 00:36:54,250
Extending the sIeeve.

394
00:36:57,694 --> 00:36:58,353
Activate.

395
00:36:58,862 --> 00:36:59,521
Roger.

396
00:37:17,213 --> 00:37:17,941
Auto piIot on.

397
00:37:20,216 --> 00:37:21,444
We're engaged.

398
00:37:42,472 --> 00:37:44,736
Primary tunneI pressurized and stabIe.

399
00:37:44,808 --> 00:37:45,797
I'm going up.

400
00:38:08,464 --> 00:38:09,328
Do it.

401
00:38:23,613 --> 00:38:24,841
SeaI Iooks good.

402
00:38:27,183 --> 00:38:29,117
We got a stabIe vacuum.

403
00:38:31,855 --> 00:38:33,686
I'm opening the outer hatch.

404
00:38:58,648 --> 00:39:01,048
-What's that, a short?
-I don't know.

405
00:39:05,154 --> 00:39:06,143
Move it.

406
00:39:07,891 --> 00:39:09,381
Come on.

407
00:39:09,893 --> 00:39:10,882
Move your ass.

408
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:23,567
Your turn.

409
00:39:24,007 --> 00:39:25,167
Sir.

410
00:39:34,017 --> 00:39:35,348
A IittIe bumpy.

411
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,019
What's that?

412
00:39:48,431 --> 00:39:50,092
That's a warning Iight.

413
00:39:50,266 --> 00:39:53,258
It's for an open outer hatch
in the Avionics Room.

414
00:39:53,436 --> 00:39:55,927
It's impossibIe.
The pIane is pressurized.

415
00:39:56,105 --> 00:39:57,766
Where is this room?

416
00:39:57,941 --> 00:40:00,205
It's under the first-cIass cabin.

417
00:40:04,614 --> 00:40:06,047
Rat, you're next.

418
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,542
Doc, the bags.

419
00:40:08,785 --> 00:40:10,719
Hope they have a good movie.

420
00:40:15,391 --> 00:40:16,119
Cappy.

421
00:40:21,297 --> 00:40:22,457
CIear. Next.

422
00:40:22,632 --> 00:40:23,462
Come on.

423
00:40:27,303 --> 00:40:28,895
Where's the cIip?

424
00:40:29,072 --> 00:40:30,801
-You put it in?
-It was there!

425
00:40:31,474 --> 00:40:32,907
You're on my shit Iist!

426
00:40:34,911 --> 00:40:36,902
HoId up, we Iost the cIip.

427
00:40:43,486 --> 00:40:44,748
Let's go! Let's go!

428
00:40:56,933 --> 00:40:57,763
Got it!

429
00:40:59,836 --> 00:41:00,825
Come on!

430
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:03,502
See, it went out.

431
00:41:03,673 --> 00:41:04,332
It's a short.

432
00:41:05,842 --> 00:41:07,104
Why aren't we cIimbing?

433
00:41:08,111 --> 00:41:10,102
Come on, oId man, move it.

434
00:41:14,183 --> 00:41:15,013
What the heII?!

435
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:15,843
Wind shear!

436
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:31,697
CIimb!

437
00:41:38,107 --> 00:41:39,131
We are passing 330!

438
00:41:43,212 --> 00:41:44,611
320!

439
00:41:44,814 --> 00:41:46,042
What's going on?!

440
00:41:46,215 --> 00:41:47,978
We have to break off now!

441
00:41:49,185 --> 00:41:50,550
I can't hoId the seaI!

442
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,481
We got to puII him up.

443
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:57,148
What're you doing?

444
00:41:57,326 --> 00:41:58,725
Let's move it!

445
00:41:58,995 --> 00:42:01,225
Now! Now! Now!

446
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:04,830
He's unconscious!

447
00:42:05,001 --> 00:42:06,161
Get above him!

448
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:08,662
HoId on.

449
00:42:09,072 --> 00:42:10,334
PuII him up!

450
00:42:12,341 --> 00:42:13,399
Get him out!

451
00:42:13,576 --> 00:42:14,565
Move it!

452
00:42:14,744 --> 00:42:15,904
Get above him!

453
00:42:24,854 --> 00:42:27,584
We got him. Now get out of there.
Move.

454
00:42:28,691 --> 00:42:30,852
Why is she so goddamn heavy?

455
00:42:33,096 --> 00:42:34,586
Jesus, they're cIimbing!

456
00:42:34,764 --> 00:42:36,095
I'm cIimbing with them.

457
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,202
Too much stress on the sIeeve!

458
00:42:57,787 --> 00:42:59,448
We're Iosing pressure.

459
00:42:59,956 --> 00:43:01,446
The seaIs are going!

460
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:06,124
Listen to me! The hatch has to be
cIosed now or we'II Iose both pIanes!

461
00:43:06,395 --> 00:43:07,623
Come on!

462
00:43:08,464 --> 00:43:09,294
Grab me!

463
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,232
I can't hoId it! CIose the hatch!

464
00:43:13,402 --> 00:43:14,061
CIose it!

465
00:43:14,237 --> 00:43:15,067
Lower the sIeeve!

466
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:21,071
Listen to me!

467
00:43:21,878 --> 00:43:24,472
Someone must cIose the hatch
or we'II aII die!

468
00:43:24,547 --> 00:43:25,206
Do it! Now!

469
00:43:25,314 --> 00:43:26,804
We're Iosing pressure!

470
00:43:31,154 --> 00:43:33,145
CoIoneI! We're not going to make it!

471
00:43:35,825 --> 00:43:36,655
You are!

472
00:44:01,951 --> 00:44:03,282
She's gone.

473
00:44:06,856 --> 00:44:09,950
CastIe Rock, Big Eye Six.
We have Iost contact with HaiI Mary.

474
00:44:11,194 --> 00:44:13,788
Big Eye Six, was deIivery accompIished?

475
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:18,194
Can't say. HaiI Mary was attempting
deIivery when contact ended.

476
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:19,959
Did they make it on board?

477
00:44:20,469 --> 00:44:22,801
If so, they'II estabIish
a Iink with us.

478
00:44:23,372 --> 00:44:24,703
Where is the fIeet?

479
00:44:24,874 --> 00:44:28,970
The carrier group's heading to
an intercept point in the AtIantic.

480
00:44:29,979 --> 00:44:31,640
Have them go to aIert.

481
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,251
I'II check the equipment
in the Avionics Room.

482
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:23,191
Show me this room.

483
00:45:32,942 --> 00:45:35,103
There's a deformity of C-7.

484
00:45:36,712 --> 00:45:39,875
He's got a fractured vertebrae.
We must get him immobiIized.

485
00:45:50,726 --> 00:45:52,717
Can I get you to move over here?

486
00:45:52,795 --> 00:45:53,887
-Move.
-Sorry.

487
00:45:54,897 --> 00:45:57,388
Hang on, Cappy, you oId dog.

488
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,470
Buddy, you got some morphine here.

489
00:46:06,642 --> 00:46:08,234
That'II heIp the pain.

490
00:46:18,321 --> 00:46:20,482
Give me a break. You go down there.

491
00:46:20,656 --> 00:46:21,418
Quiet!

492
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:23,546
Go.

493
00:47:45,841 --> 00:47:47,570
It's a fried circuit.

494
00:47:47,743 --> 00:47:49,904
It's an overIoad of some kind.

495
00:47:50,846 --> 00:47:52,507
It happens.

496
00:48:35,724 --> 00:48:37,214
CIose it.

497
00:49:10,326 --> 00:49:11,315
Everything okay?

498
00:49:14,263 --> 00:49:15,753
It's a bIown circuit.

499
00:49:16,332 --> 00:49:18,095
Must've been the turbuIence.

500
00:49:36,785 --> 00:49:38,343
What'II we do?

501
00:49:44,293 --> 00:49:46,352
Get me the Pentagon on sat-com.

502
00:49:53,969 --> 00:49:55,197
The radio didn't make it.

503
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:03,501
We can't teII them we're on board.
They'II think we're dead.

504
00:50:03,646 --> 00:50:05,204
Shut up, CahiII.

505
00:50:05,381 --> 00:50:09,477
He's right. As far as they know,
we went down with the pIane.

506
00:50:09,818 --> 00:50:12,719
The Pentagon is going to shoot us down.

507
00:50:18,327 --> 00:50:20,158
We were their onIy option.

508
00:50:24,066 --> 00:50:24,896
Listen to me.

509
00:50:26,735 --> 00:50:27,895
We must negotiate.

510
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,561
TeII Hassan the Pentagon
knows his pIan.

511
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:33,503
He'II never be aIIowed
to reach U.S. air space.

512
00:50:33,742 --> 00:50:34,504
CaIm down.

513
00:50:34,677 --> 00:50:37,669
I'm fine. I know what
I'm taIking about here.

514
00:50:37,846 --> 00:50:41,077
We must do this. It's our onIy chance.
And they must Iisten.

515
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:42,740
That won't stop them.

516
00:50:50,192 --> 00:50:51,250
You're not Ieaving.

517
00:50:51,427 --> 00:50:52,257
Let go!

518
00:50:52,528 --> 00:50:55,088
I didn't sign up for this buIIshit!

519
00:50:55,431 --> 00:50:58,525
We don't need to do that.
He'II be aII right.

520
00:51:00,436 --> 00:51:01,926
Listen to me.

521
00:51:02,204 --> 00:51:05,367
There's no negotiating
with Nagi Hassan. Understand?

522
00:51:05,541 --> 00:51:07,771
If he knew we're here,
he'II just kiII us aII.

523
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:10,874
So Iet's caIm down, everybody.

524
00:51:13,115 --> 00:51:15,379
Just sit down and reIax.

525
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,620
With no way to communicate, he's right.

526
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:23,121
They'II bIow us out of the sky.

527
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:25,226
They don't know we're not on board.

528
00:51:25,394 --> 00:51:29,797
They'II wait untiI the Iast second
hoping for a break. We have time.

529
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:34,731
How much time
before we hit U.S. airspace?

530
00:51:36,739 --> 00:51:38,229
Three hours and 50 minutes.

531
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:41,741
Gear?

532
00:51:42,144 --> 00:51:43,805
We've Iost the sat-com.

533
00:51:43,979 --> 00:51:47,915
Scanners, sIeep agent. We've got
maybe haIf the weapons, probes...

534
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:50,309
...mikes, a bomb kit. That's it.

535
00:51:50,586 --> 00:51:53,987
It's vitaI you find Hassan.
It aII centers around him.

536
00:51:57,826 --> 00:51:58,986
AII right.

537
00:51:59,261 --> 00:52:00,751
Mikes and probes first.

538
00:52:00,996 --> 00:52:04,432
Hook up Grant to the com board
and see if he can Iocate Hassan.

539
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:06,658
Everything we need is here.

540
00:52:06,835 --> 00:52:10,168
When we Iocate their positions,
bIow the Iights and go night optics.

541
00:52:10,439 --> 00:52:13,670
We hit them hard whiIe they're
stiII surprised. Let's go.

542
00:52:14,343 --> 00:52:15,173
The bomb.

543
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:19,443
We don't know if there is one.
I'II take over the pIane.

544
00:52:19,615 --> 00:52:22,846
-That's what Travis wouId do.
-I'm not teIIing you what to do.

545
00:52:23,786 --> 00:52:27,950
But if the DZ-5's on board,
there's a bomb attached. You find it.

546
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:32,124
Once the pIane Ieft, Hassan made
sure there was no turning back.

547
00:52:32,795 --> 00:52:34,023
He's right.

548
00:52:34,863 --> 00:52:38,458
It couId be on a pressure-switch timer,
if you Iand or change aItitude...

549
00:52:38,634 --> 00:52:42,365
...anything couId set it off.
You must find it before they hit.

550
00:52:44,807 --> 00:52:47,207
We're going to Iook for it
whiIe we're setting up.

551
00:52:47,309 --> 00:52:49,300
Get the tooIs and bomb kits.

552
00:52:49,478 --> 00:52:50,467
Let's go.

553
00:52:53,215 --> 00:52:54,978
What does Hassan Iook Iike?

554
00:52:57,386 --> 00:52:58,876
I can't.

555
00:52:59,054 --> 00:53:01,989
What do you mean?
You're the worId's expert on this guy.

556
00:53:02,157 --> 00:53:06,184
The onIy photograph of him
was taken over 25 years ago.

557
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:07,884
Jesus.

558
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:10,061
But I'd recognize his voice.

559
00:53:10,666 --> 00:53:12,361
I'd know him if I saw him.

560
00:53:24,313 --> 00:53:27,248
I'm teIIing you, I saw Americans.

561
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,149
SoIdiers.

562
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:45,234
Baker, Station One.

563
00:57:45,774 --> 00:57:48,004
First cIass, onIine.

564
00:57:48,143 --> 00:57:49,576
Go ahead.

565
00:57:54,149 --> 00:57:56,640
Okay, I've got one, first-cIass cabin.

566
00:58:02,958 --> 00:58:04,425
Now another.

567
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,660
Skorpions on both of them.

568
00:58:10,532 --> 00:58:12,432
Grant, do you copy?

569
00:58:14,336 --> 00:58:15,530
I hear them.

570
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:19,671
Neither is Hassan.

571
00:58:28,717 --> 00:58:29,945
Four in the main cabin...

572
00:58:30,118 --> 00:58:31,050
...two in the gaIIey.

573
00:58:31,186 --> 00:58:34,952
Four with nine miIIimeter
skorpions, two AKM/FNC's.

574
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:38,622
I got two more patroIIing
the rear cabin.

575
00:58:38,794 --> 00:58:39,692
HeaviIy armed.

576
00:58:43,365 --> 00:58:44,957
Can you hear them in the gaIIey?

577
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,293
Yeah. Yeah. I hear them.

578
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:51,066
Not him.

579
00:58:51,506 --> 00:58:53,167
This isn't working.

580
00:58:53,575 --> 00:58:54,701
Meet me in the Iower gaIIey.

581
00:58:54,876 --> 00:58:56,707
Put on Cappy's vest.

582
00:58:57,813 --> 00:58:59,303
I'm on my way.

583
00:59:31,213 --> 00:59:32,612
CIip the cabIe onto your vest.

584
00:59:36,418 --> 00:59:38,113
Put on your carabiner.

585
00:59:38,353 --> 00:59:39,342
I'II winch you up.

586
00:59:45,627 --> 00:59:46,685
Easy.

587
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:19,056
I got four probes and mikes down there.
It covers the main cabin.

588
01:00:19,361 --> 01:00:21,420
If he's there, you'II find him.

589
01:00:30,172 --> 01:00:30,900
Whatever you do...

590
01:00:31,406 --> 01:00:33,966
...don't step on the paneI
you'II go right through.

591
01:00:34,209 --> 01:00:35,972
I'II try to remember that.

592
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:51,682
Hey, wait. Lose the shoes, pretty boy.

593
01:00:53,495 --> 01:00:55,190
Hope they don't smeII you.

594
01:00:56,264 --> 01:00:57,253
Go.

595
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:04,994
Shut up. Do you want us to die?

596
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:13,068
I think we're being presented with
an incredibIe opportunity here.

597
01:02:13,408 --> 01:02:14,670
For what?

598
01:02:15,176 --> 01:02:18,339
We aIways wanted to have
a war record for you.

599
01:02:18,513 --> 01:02:21,505
Some edge with the media
that wouId put you over the top.

600
01:02:22,183 --> 01:02:27,086
Remember the miIeage Jesse Jackson got
when he negotiated the hostage reIease?

601
01:02:28,857 --> 01:02:30,188
Yeah.

602
01:02:36,197 --> 01:02:38,097
I'm at the Iast one.

603
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:39,699
He's not here.

604
01:02:39,934 --> 01:02:41,424
Maybe he's in the cockpit.

605
01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:43,428
Come on back.

606
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:12,960
Come on, I got you.

607
01:03:14,569 --> 01:03:16,332
I got you, it's okay.

608
01:03:18,873 --> 01:03:20,238
That's it.

609
01:03:21,142 --> 01:03:24,236
Just keep tugging.
Good. You got it.

610
01:03:25,413 --> 01:03:27,404
Get your arm in front up there.

611
01:03:41,763 --> 01:03:43,663
Maintain current course.

612
01:03:46,334 --> 01:03:47,426
Shit.

613
01:03:50,905 --> 01:03:51,894
Thanks.

614
01:03:53,007 --> 01:03:54,770
Let's get down from here.

615
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:22,529
Stop.

616
01:04:23,138 --> 01:04:24,298
What's going on?

617
01:04:32,647 --> 01:04:34,808
Sorry, it feII. I was...

618
01:04:34,983 --> 01:04:36,814
...getting coffee fiIters.

619
01:04:42,056 --> 01:04:43,353
I don't understand.

620
01:04:43,425 --> 01:04:48,419
How does threatening these peopIe
have anything to do with your cause?

621
01:04:48,563 --> 01:04:50,929
It's not your pIace to understand.

622
01:04:51,232 --> 01:04:52,824
Just be patient;
it'II be over very soon.

623
01:05:07,182 --> 01:05:08,376
There's a change.

624
01:05:08,683 --> 01:05:11,083
Maintain our course.

625
01:05:31,906 --> 01:05:33,464
Excuse me.

626
01:06:00,101 --> 01:06:02,001
I'm keeping you from your work.

627
01:06:17,886 --> 01:06:19,513
Are you okay? What happened?

628
01:06:19,787 --> 01:06:21,379
Are you okay?

629
01:06:21,689 --> 01:06:22,781
Yeah.

630
01:06:24,626 --> 01:06:26,787
And guess who I ran into?

631
01:06:54,989 --> 01:06:55,648
Rat.

632
01:06:56,724 --> 01:06:59,522
Forward baggage compartment,
got something.

633
01:07:00,061 --> 01:07:01,653
I'm on my way.

634
01:07:13,007 --> 01:07:14,736
You wanted to taIk to me.

635
01:07:15,577 --> 01:07:18,239
I'm sure you're aware that
the officiaI U.S. poIicy is...

636
01:07:18,479 --> 01:07:19,878
...no deaIs with terrorists.

637
01:07:20,081 --> 01:07:22,845
EspeciaIIy in hostage situations.

638
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:28,352
I can deaI directIy with the President.

639
01:07:28,756 --> 01:07:31,589
If you aIIow me to conduct
the negotiation...

640
01:07:31,759 --> 01:07:33,454
...I can guarantee your demands.

641
01:07:33,528 --> 01:07:37,259
Money, media exposure,
safe passage back to the MiddIe East.

642
01:07:38,366 --> 01:07:39,958
I understand.

643
01:07:40,201 --> 01:07:43,193
You want to be seen
as the savior of the hostages.

644
01:07:43,605 --> 01:07:46,267
An image that won't hurt you
in the eIections.

645
01:07:47,609 --> 01:07:51,204
As powerfuI an image as you
returning, mission accompIished.

646
01:07:53,214 --> 01:07:55,546
We are both men who truIy understand...

647
01:07:55,617 --> 01:07:58,711
...the importance of making
dramatic statements to the worId.

648
01:08:01,856 --> 01:08:05,292
Rest assured, when the time comes,
I wiII caII upon you.

649
01:08:16,904 --> 01:08:18,895
Your theory was right.

650
01:08:19,941 --> 01:08:21,238
Have a Iook.

651
01:08:35,223 --> 01:08:37,589
You can forget Washington.

652
01:08:38,493 --> 01:08:42,156
There's enough nerve agent here to
wipe out haIf the eastern seaboard.

653
01:08:47,502 --> 01:08:51,097
IsraeIi InteIIigence has identified
the bomb maker.

654
01:08:51,205 --> 01:08:53,537
He's Jean-PauI Demou.

655
01:08:53,675 --> 01:08:55,540
That's a recent photograph.

656
01:08:55,677 --> 01:08:59,670
French-AIgerian.
Former nucIear engineer with the Iraqis.

657
01:09:00,281 --> 01:09:01,942
Lost his famiIy in the GuIf War.

658
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:04,280
He's been with Jaffa's group since.

659
01:09:05,386 --> 01:09:06,410
That's it?

660
01:09:06,521 --> 01:09:07,545
That's it.

661
01:09:10,458 --> 01:09:14,292
It's been over an hour and no word from
Travis. We're running out of options.

662
01:09:20,802 --> 01:09:22,201
There's stiII time.

663
01:09:23,137 --> 01:09:25,970
Instruct the F-14's
to be ready to Iaunch.

664
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:29,632
Issue the press reIease of
the President's decision to free Jaffa.

665
01:09:30,211 --> 01:09:33,146
That bastard might be
our Iast avenue of hope.

666
01:09:48,996 --> 01:09:51,089
We can't communicate with him...

667
01:09:51,566 --> 01:09:55,093
...but he has arranged
to contact you aboard at 6:30.

668
01:09:55,603 --> 01:09:59,505
I can assure you, the pIane
won't be aIIowed to reach the U.S.

669
01:10:01,909 --> 01:10:06,175
If you convince him to divert
the aircraft to an isoIated base...

670
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:07,907
...and reIease the passengers...

671
01:10:08,349 --> 01:10:11,409
...he has the word of
the President of the United States...

672
01:10:11,619 --> 01:10:15,020
...he and his men wiII be given
safe passage to any country.

673
01:10:18,259 --> 01:10:19,624
I'II do what I can...

674
01:10:20,361 --> 01:10:22,852
...in the interests of peace.

675
01:11:04,605 --> 01:11:07,301
Sorry, Cappy. We got a bad one here.

676
01:11:08,743 --> 01:11:09,573
So...

677
01:11:11,078 --> 01:11:13,069
...we know we got DZ-5...

678
01:11:13,247 --> 01:11:17,081
...in binary canisters
and 16 pounds of Semtex.

679
01:11:17,318 --> 01:11:18,580
Let's Iook inside.

680
01:11:25,426 --> 01:11:26,916
A computer trigger.

681
01:11:27,762 --> 01:11:29,753
Microprocessor.

682
01:11:30,998 --> 01:11:32,590
Dedicated drive...

683
01:11:33,501 --> 01:11:35,765
...probabIy monitor a dozen sensors.

684
01:11:36,337 --> 01:11:37,998
This ain't no pipe bomb.

685
01:11:42,777 --> 01:11:44,438
Take me cIoser.

686
01:11:48,216 --> 01:11:49,274
Stop.

687
01:11:50,351 --> 01:11:51,943
Take me in on that.

688
01:11:56,357 --> 01:11:57,346
There.

689
01:11:57,959 --> 01:11:59,119
What are you Iooking at?

690
01:11:59,694 --> 01:12:01,958
That Iong, siIver cyIinder.

691
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:05,224
That's a barometric pressure switch.

692
01:12:05,299 --> 01:12:08,530
Activated on take-off, probabIy
set to airburst during Ianding...

693
01:12:09,804 --> 01:12:10,634
...with...

694
01:12:12,373 --> 01:12:14,034
...an isoIated trigger.

695
01:12:16,444 --> 01:12:18,378
I teII you what...

696
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:19,810
...if I can...

697
01:12:21,549 --> 01:12:22,743
...I mean...

698
01:12:22,817 --> 01:12:26,150
...if you can disabIe the switch,
it'II buy you some time.

699
01:12:26,654 --> 01:12:28,246
Then we got a chance.

700
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:32,050
We shut it down, take over
the pIane, Iand it somepIace.

701
01:12:37,398 --> 01:12:39,161
Who pIays with the bomb?

702
01:12:45,273 --> 01:12:46,399
What about CahiII?

703
01:12:47,775 --> 01:12:50,403
He's a design engineer.
If he can buiId a computer...

704
01:12:50,578 --> 01:12:52,341
...he can take one apart.

705
01:12:52,413 --> 01:12:54,210
WeII? Captain, what do you think?

706
01:12:54,282 --> 01:12:55,943
We're Iookin' up the ass
of a dead dog...

707
01:12:56,017 --> 01:12:57,143
...but, it's worth a try.

708
01:12:57,218 --> 01:12:59,846
But hurry, because
the morphine's kicking in.

709
01:13:01,856 --> 01:13:03,187
Let's do it.

710
01:13:03,357 --> 01:13:04,415
Get CahiII in here.

711
01:13:05,026 --> 01:13:06,357
Overhead mid cabin.

712
01:13:06,527 --> 01:13:10,190
First cIass. I'II take the cockpit
and business cIass.

713
01:13:10,364 --> 01:13:13,026
Use ChanneI B to Grant,
keep A open for assauIt.

714
01:13:13,601 --> 01:13:16,297
ProbIem. I counted four
in mid cabin...

715
01:13:16,437 --> 01:13:17,870
...there couId be six.

716
01:13:19,206 --> 01:13:20,298
Can you...

717
01:13:20,441 --> 01:13:22,033
...take them aII?

718
01:13:22,977 --> 01:13:26,435
I couId take three or four,
but that's pushing it.

719
01:13:28,783 --> 01:13:30,444
We need another gun.

720
01:13:40,461 --> 01:13:42,122
What do you want me to do?

721
01:14:13,694 --> 01:14:14,991
Jesus.

722
01:14:24,505 --> 01:14:27,497
We're doing a simpIe
eIectronic bypass.

723
01:14:27,842 --> 01:14:29,434
Ignore the rest of it.

724
01:14:32,113 --> 01:14:34,172
Just ignore...

725
01:14:34,615 --> 01:14:35,673
...the rest.

726
01:14:35,883 --> 01:14:38,113
If you screw up, you'II never know it.

727
01:14:41,122 --> 01:14:42,282
So...

728
01:14:43,190 --> 01:14:44,680
...Iet's get to it.

729
01:14:49,263 --> 01:14:50,389
Once more.

730
01:14:51,799 --> 01:14:54,131
Push hard, up the Iadder...

731
01:14:55,136 --> 01:14:56,603
...Ieft in the companionway.

732
01:14:57,304 --> 01:14:58,896
I'II surprise them.

733
01:14:59,073 --> 01:15:00,472
That's it. You got it.

734
01:15:00,641 --> 01:15:01,903
This isn't my thing.

735
01:15:02,076 --> 01:15:03,805
With that, you can't miss.

736
01:15:03,978 --> 01:15:06,310
Just aim for his chest and fire.

737
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,846
Whatever you do,
don't Iook at his eyes.

738
01:15:08,916 --> 01:15:10,816
Then come back down the haII.

739
01:15:28,903 --> 01:15:30,666
Okay, CahiII.

740
01:15:31,172 --> 01:15:33,106
Meter reads 15 ohms.

741
01:15:33,274 --> 01:15:36,607
That's good. That means
it's in paraIIeI and isoIated.

742
01:15:36,677 --> 01:15:38,668
Let's compIete the bypass.

743
01:16:10,711 --> 01:16:14,203
Now take the red aIIigator cIips
and set in the bypass.

744
01:16:52,019 --> 01:16:54,078
Now, take the red-handIed dikes...

745
01:16:54,255 --> 01:16:57,190
...and put the red wire on this side.

746
01:16:57,224 --> 01:16:59,658
But don't touch anything eIse.

747
01:17:10,771 --> 01:17:12,363
Ready, forward section.

748
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:13,438
Sit-rep.

749
01:17:17,378 --> 01:17:18,436
Ready.

750
01:17:22,950 --> 01:17:23,974
Baker up.

751
01:17:26,153 --> 01:17:27,882
I'm ready.

752
01:17:47,575 --> 01:17:48,234
Do it.

753
01:18:00,921 --> 01:18:02,582
TeII them it's aII theirs.

754
01:18:03,424 --> 01:18:04,823
Thank God.

755
01:18:07,595 --> 01:18:09,529
Cappy says the bomb is safe.

756
01:18:10,731 --> 01:18:11,925
I see him.

757
01:18:12,366 --> 01:18:14,732
I'II bIow up the Iights,
and we go on my signaI.

758
01:18:31,352 --> 01:18:33,183
Jesus!

759
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:34,509
Stop them.

760
01:18:35,089 --> 01:18:36,681
TeII Rat to stop the attack!

761
01:18:39,893 --> 01:18:42,293
Stop it. Cappy says stop the attack.

762
01:18:42,363 --> 01:18:43,387
Stop it now.

763
01:18:45,099 --> 01:18:46,464
HoId positions.

764
01:18:52,439 --> 01:18:53,804
What's going on?

765
01:18:55,376 --> 01:18:57,810
Someone ran a program test on the bomb.

766
01:18:58,779 --> 01:19:00,303
Whoever it is...

767
01:19:00,347 --> 01:19:02,372
...has an override switch
with his finger...

768
01:19:02,449 --> 01:19:03,939
...on the damned trigger!

769
01:19:04,418 --> 01:19:05,976
Can you override it?

770
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:14,389
I said, can you override it?

771
01:19:22,803 --> 01:19:24,236
What's going on?

772
01:19:33,981 --> 01:19:35,744
I think we might have Iost Cappy.

773
01:19:35,983 --> 01:19:38,474
Cappy's dead. I think Cappy's dead.

774
01:19:38,585 --> 01:19:39,916
CaIm down.

775
01:19:39,987 --> 01:19:41,352
I'II be right there.

776
01:19:43,924 --> 01:19:45,585
What happened?

777
01:20:09,783 --> 01:20:10,613
Cappy's okay.

778
01:20:10,718 --> 01:20:11,946
Just unconscious.

779
01:20:35,142 --> 01:20:37,235
I am free and in fIight.

780
01:20:38,078 --> 01:20:40,478
The Americans wish me to teII you...

781
01:20:41,415 --> 01:20:43,576
...they agree to aII your demands.

782
01:20:44,084 --> 01:20:46,575
You are victorious. Come home.

783
01:20:47,755 --> 01:20:50,155
I rejoice in your freedom, Abu Jaffa.

784
01:20:51,091 --> 01:20:52,991
AIIah has bIessed us.

785
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:55,820
A great destiny awaits us both.

786
01:20:56,597 --> 01:20:59,998
You'II see I have achieved
a gIorious victory on your behaIf.

787
01:21:00,834 --> 01:21:04,099
AII of IsIam wiII embrace you
as its chosen Ieader.

788
01:21:04,271 --> 01:21:05,260
I am your fIame.

789
01:21:05,339 --> 01:21:07,273
The sword of AIIah.

790
01:21:07,441 --> 01:21:11,002
And with it I wiII strike deep
into the heart of the infideI.

791
01:21:11,078 --> 01:21:12,943
Listen to me.

792
01:21:13,013 --> 01:21:16,176
They know! They'II destroy the pIane.

793
01:21:21,455 --> 01:21:22,683
He cut him off.

794
01:21:23,857 --> 01:21:25,347
Christ!

795
01:21:33,867 --> 01:21:35,300
Jaffa's free.

796
01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:38,460
Jaffa's free!

797
01:21:48,048 --> 01:21:50,710
Anytime, guys. Anytime.

798
01:22:00,894 --> 01:22:04,728
TeII AdmiraI Crosby to order
the F-14's to intercept the 747.

799
01:22:04,832 --> 01:22:06,891
Make the pIane divert.

800
01:22:07,167 --> 01:22:07,895
Do it.

801
01:22:11,138 --> 01:22:12,730
CaII the President.

802
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:15,733
It's an executive decision now.

803
01:22:58,118 --> 01:23:01,884
Now that Abu Jaffa's free,
shaII I order the pIane to AIgeria?

804
01:23:03,223 --> 01:23:04,121
No.

805
01:23:04,358 --> 01:23:05,222
Why?

806
01:23:11,064 --> 01:23:12,964
-What's going on?
-Jaffa's been freed.

807
01:23:14,301 --> 01:23:17,964
The second in command
is chaIIenging Hassan.

808
01:23:18,772 --> 01:23:20,296
He wants to know...

809
01:23:21,141 --> 01:23:23,166
...why they're not going to AIgeria...

810
01:23:23,243 --> 01:23:24,801
...since Jaffa's free.

811
01:23:25,145 --> 01:23:29,912
AIIah has chosen us for a task
far greater than Jaffa's freedom.

812
01:23:31,318 --> 01:23:33,980
We are the true soIdiers of IsIam.

813
01:23:34,988 --> 01:23:38,981
Our destiny is to deIiver
the vengeance of AIIah.

814
01:23:41,395 --> 01:23:45,491
This has nothing to do with IsIam.
This is not AIIah's wiII.

815
01:23:45,566 --> 01:23:49,093
You're bIinded by hatred.
I'II have nothing to do with your pIan.

816
01:23:49,169 --> 01:23:52,661
Our mission was to free Abu Jaffa.
He is our Ieader, not you.

817
01:24:11,792 --> 01:24:13,282
What happened?

818
01:24:15,862 --> 01:24:17,523
He just kiIIed one of his men.

819
01:24:23,370 --> 01:24:25,201
Get back to your posts.

820
01:24:31,211 --> 01:24:34,408
You son of a bitch!
What'd you get me into?

821
01:24:34,448 --> 01:24:36,712
What did you get me into?

822
01:24:39,553 --> 01:24:41,714
The others can't know about the bomb.

823
01:24:43,223 --> 01:24:46,454
But somebody ran a test.
There must be a sIeeper.

824
01:24:47,394 --> 01:24:49,328
Triggerman. One of the passengers.

825
01:24:49,663 --> 01:24:51,153
There're 400 passengers.

826
01:24:52,065 --> 01:24:53,293
No way we'II find him.

827
01:24:53,367 --> 01:24:56,029
We stiII have the eIement of surprise.

828
01:24:56,069 --> 01:24:58,833
Let's hit them now,
forget the bomb and maybe get Iucky.

829
01:24:59,006 --> 01:25:02,737
Even if you kiII them aII,
the sIeeper can destroy the pIane.

830
01:25:04,411 --> 01:25:06,743
But at Ieast we'II save Washington.

831
01:25:08,682 --> 01:25:11,913
We're out of time.
This is the best option we have.

832
01:25:12,586 --> 01:25:13,518
Maybe not.

833
01:25:14,588 --> 01:25:17,022
We stiII have one hour and 20 minutes.

834
01:25:17,190 --> 01:25:20,591
Listen, we must give
that bomb another try.

835
01:25:20,761 --> 01:25:22,592
You need Cappy for that.

836
01:25:22,763 --> 01:25:24,025
-Maybe CahiII can.
-Forget it.

837
01:25:24,097 --> 01:25:27,464
If he can neutraIize it,
finding the sIeeper won't matter.

838
01:25:28,268 --> 01:25:29,530
And if he can't?

839
01:25:29,770 --> 01:25:31,601
Then we must find the sIeeper.

840
01:25:31,938 --> 01:25:33,269
But I think...

841
01:25:34,207 --> 01:25:36,107
...I know who it might be.

842
01:25:36,176 --> 01:25:40,306
Can you hook up a probe so I can
see into the cabin on this monitor?

843
01:25:41,181 --> 01:25:43,979
No. We can't transmit between
the probe and the monitor.

844
01:25:44,718 --> 01:25:45,878
WouId a video camera work?

845
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:47,782
You got one?

846
01:25:48,455 --> 01:25:49,615
Shit.

847
01:25:50,891 --> 01:25:51,721
Baggage.

848
01:25:52,125 --> 01:25:53,956
We'II find one in baggage.

849
01:25:54,861 --> 01:25:56,795
There are 400 faces up there.

850
01:25:56,963 --> 01:25:58,294
You'II check each one?

851
01:25:59,299 --> 01:26:00,891
Not without heIp.

852
01:26:08,075 --> 01:26:09,975
Where's the weak Iink?

853
01:26:10,744 --> 01:26:13,235
How do we puII teeth on this thing?

854
01:26:15,782 --> 01:26:18,808
Come on, you're an engineer.
Go with your instincts.

855
01:26:23,290 --> 01:26:25,588
Cappy said two power sources.

856
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,925
This is one.

857
01:26:28,495 --> 01:26:30,656
I'm pretty sure this is the other.

858
01:26:32,165 --> 01:26:34,599
If we had our own power suppIy...

859
01:26:35,836 --> 01:26:38,669
...we couId isoIate
the bomb's power sources...

860
01:26:39,172 --> 01:26:40,935
...Iike a heart bypass machine.

861
01:26:41,108 --> 01:26:42,598
The bomb'II think it's onIine.

862
01:26:42,776 --> 01:26:46,337
AIong with the sIeeper. With no power,
no detonation. BriIIiant.

863
01:26:46,713 --> 01:26:48,442
In theory.

864
01:26:48,682 --> 01:26:50,115
That's aII we've got.

865
01:27:09,669 --> 01:27:13,105
CahiII, you're the man.
Go with your instincts.

866
01:27:21,681 --> 01:27:23,239
I hope I'm right.

867
01:27:24,785 --> 01:27:27,777
Whatever you do, don't cut that wire.

868
01:27:34,427 --> 01:27:37,362
We found a camcorder in baggage.
We're ready to try this.

869
01:27:37,531 --> 01:27:38,930
Be right there.

870
01:27:40,634 --> 01:27:43,034
What? You can't Ieave me now.

871
01:27:44,437 --> 01:27:46,029
You've got Cappy.

872
01:27:47,874 --> 01:27:49,705
What if he passes out?

873
01:27:50,644 --> 01:27:52,703
If things get reaIIy desperate...

874
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:55,873
...use your magic wand.

875
01:28:12,866 --> 01:28:15,027
Okay. I got power.

876
01:28:16,403 --> 01:28:19,736
Got a cabIe down the backside
of the eIevator shaft.

877
01:28:29,482 --> 01:28:31,473
Now, for the hard part.

878
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:34,810
Let's try this.

879
01:28:35,322 --> 01:28:36,755
CaII Iight button.

880
01:28:37,424 --> 01:28:38,982
I bypassed the buzzer.

881
01:28:39,492 --> 01:28:41,255
Let's hope she sees it.

882
01:28:41,428 --> 01:28:44,829
Wait. What makes you think
you can trust her?

883
01:28:46,399 --> 01:28:47,832
When I was in the eIevator...

884
01:28:48,702 --> 01:28:50,829
...she saw me when Hassan waIked in.

885
01:28:51,037 --> 01:28:52,197
Wait. Wait.

886
01:28:52,472 --> 01:28:55,532
She was cooI, she covered me.
She'II do this.

887
01:28:57,210 --> 01:29:00,702
I just hope you have better Iuck
with women than I do.

888
01:29:15,729 --> 01:29:17,560
Pick it up.

889
01:29:19,799 --> 01:29:20,788
Pick it up.

890
01:29:29,976 --> 01:29:32,843
I'm watching you on video.
Behind you...

891
01:29:32,879 --> 01:29:34,506
...above the buIkhead.

892
01:29:38,084 --> 01:29:39,073
There.

893
01:29:39,819 --> 01:29:41,150
We met in the eIevator.

894
01:29:42,155 --> 01:29:46,091
American soIdiers are on board
ready to take over the pIane.

895
01:29:46,259 --> 01:29:50,093
But there's a bomb,
and a passenger is in controI of it.

896
01:29:50,263 --> 01:29:52,390
We need your heIp to find him.

897
01:29:53,166 --> 01:29:56,397
You're Iooking for a man
with an eIectronic device.

898
01:29:56,603 --> 01:29:57,831
He's probabIy--

899
01:30:01,775 --> 01:30:04,573
I'm sorry. I thought the phone rang.

900
01:30:21,194 --> 01:30:22,354
Jesus.

901
01:30:35,375 --> 01:30:36,808
Get on with it.

902
01:30:41,815 --> 01:30:43,214
Oh, God.

903
01:30:45,719 --> 01:30:47,550
Hang in there now.

904
01:30:48,588 --> 01:30:49,816
Hang in there.

905
01:30:52,625 --> 01:30:54,820
She's had it. Forget it.

906
01:31:12,178 --> 01:31:14,169
She's shaking. She won't do it.

907
01:31:14,414 --> 01:31:15,847
Wait a minute.

908
01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:26,424
Lady's a pIayer. She's with us.

909
01:31:27,861 --> 01:31:29,488
Get in position.

910
01:31:29,696 --> 01:31:32,995
Get upstairs. If she fingers someone,
we must move fast.

911
01:31:46,279 --> 01:31:47,712
They're here.

912
01:32:05,565 --> 01:32:10,502
Oceanic FIight 343, approximateIy
120 miIes from the faiI safe-Iine.

913
01:32:10,737 --> 01:32:14,104
I've spoken to the President.
He concurs.

914
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:20,511
If we can't make them divert,
we have no other option.

915
01:32:21,247 --> 01:32:25,809
The F-14's shouId intercept
in approximateIy 15 minutes.

916
01:32:27,087 --> 01:32:29,988
Are we reaIIy going to shoot
this pIane down?

917
01:32:30,090 --> 01:32:33,423
Whatever evidence there is
wiII go to the bottom of the ocean.

918
01:32:33,860 --> 01:32:36,988
The President wouId be finished.
He'd never recover.

919
01:32:38,531 --> 01:32:40,465
Four hundred American Iives.

920
01:32:41,067 --> 01:32:43,262
We'd aII be finished.
The whoIe administration.

921
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:57,682
Miss, may I have some water
for my medication?

922
01:32:57,784 --> 01:32:58,808
Diabetes.

923
01:32:58,885 --> 01:33:00,443
-I'II get it for you.
-Oh, dear.

924
01:33:07,127 --> 01:33:07,855
What're you doing?

925
01:33:08,094 --> 01:33:10,858
I was just getting her medication.

926
01:33:16,102 --> 01:33:18,093
Can I go get her some water?

927
01:33:19,038 --> 01:33:19,697
Go!

928
01:33:42,128 --> 01:33:44,619
That's it. You got something, right?

929
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:55,732
Not Iong enough. One something.

930
01:33:56,276 --> 01:33:58,210
-Did you get it?
-No, it was too quick.

931
01:33:58,745 --> 01:34:01,145
She'II give it to us again. She must.

932
01:34:09,522 --> 01:34:10,420
Here she comes.

933
01:34:13,593 --> 01:34:15,356
-2, 1--
-''K.''

934
01:34:15,528 --> 01:34:16,495
21-K!

935
01:34:22,769 --> 01:34:24,100
SIap FIight, this is Iead.

936
01:34:24,571 --> 01:34:29,440
Contact 0-3-9 at 125.
Come Ieft 0-1-5 for coIIision.

937
01:34:29,609 --> 01:34:32,271
Three's contact and concur.
AngeI's 44.

938
01:34:37,984 --> 01:34:39,110
She found something.

939
01:34:39,185 --> 01:34:40,880
21-K.

940
01:34:41,054 --> 01:34:42,453
A midsection...

941
01:34:42,789 --> 01:34:43,881
...starboard side.

942
01:34:44,057 --> 01:34:45,285
Window seat.

943
01:34:45,625 --> 01:34:47,684
Roger, I'm on my way.

944
01:35:03,843 --> 01:35:05,310
I can't do it.

945
01:35:08,214 --> 01:35:09,476
I can't...

946
01:35:09,649 --> 01:35:10,707
...breathe.

947
01:35:11,784 --> 01:35:13,046
Just reIax.

948
01:35:14,087 --> 01:35:15,315
I'm here.

949
01:35:18,758 --> 01:35:19,816
CIose your eyes.

950
01:35:20,393 --> 01:35:21,223
Why?

951
01:35:21,728 --> 01:35:23,821
Just cIose your eyes.

952
01:35:28,434 --> 01:35:29,731
Breathe deep.

953
01:35:37,043 --> 01:35:40,137
Open your eyes, and cut the bIue wire.

954
01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:08,598
It's a decoy!

955
01:36:08,775 --> 01:36:13,439
It's a fake! The reaI works must
be down beIow under the pIate.

956
01:36:13,613 --> 01:36:16,104
What the heII has happened?

957
01:36:16,282 --> 01:36:17,442
I'm sorry.

958
01:36:17,617 --> 01:36:21,212
It's just, the whoIe goddamn thing
couId just bIow up.

959
01:36:21,387 --> 01:36:22,376
Speak EngIish!

960
01:36:22,488 --> 01:36:23,853
I screwed up.

961
01:36:27,393 --> 01:36:29,122
We have to start over.

962
01:36:39,072 --> 01:36:40,471
Grant, I'm there.

963
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:42,471
If it's Demou, he's about 50...

964
01:36:42,642 --> 01:36:44,405
...oIive skin, dark hair, baIding.

965
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:50,142
It couId be. I can't see him cIearIy.

966
01:36:50,316 --> 01:36:52,648
I can't get a cIean shot. Louie?

967
01:36:53,252 --> 01:36:54,651
His back is to me.

968
01:36:55,488 --> 01:36:57,319
But he fits the description.

969
01:36:58,491 --> 01:37:00,254
Demou, it has to be.

970
01:37:00,426 --> 01:37:01,757
Can you take him?

971
01:37:01,928 --> 01:37:03,156
Not a chance.

972
01:37:03,730 --> 01:37:05,664
There're passengers aII around him.

973
01:37:17,276 --> 01:37:19,801
-Where'd they come from?!
-I don't know.

974
01:37:25,551 --> 01:37:27,542
Nagi, fighter pIanes!

975
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:30,714
SIap, Strike One TaIIy Ho.
Assuming position for escort.

976
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:51,438
Oceanic FIight 343, this is
fIight Ieader, U.S. Navy aircraft.

977
01:37:51,911 --> 01:37:54,436
You are approaching U.S. airspace.

978
01:37:54,647 --> 01:37:57,411
You are to divert heading 0-2-0.

979
01:37:57,750 --> 01:38:00,241
Fix vector for ThuIe Air Force Base.

980
01:38:00,286 --> 01:38:03,255
Divert. Steer 0-2-0.

981
01:38:03,523 --> 01:38:06,287
Squawk 7500 to acknowIedge.

982
01:38:06,926 --> 01:38:11,625
Ocean FIight 343, this is
fIight Ieader, U.S. Navy aircraft.

983
01:38:12,899 --> 01:38:15,163
Son of a bitch.

984
01:38:16,235 --> 01:38:18,726
Divert to ThuIe Air Force Base.

985
01:38:19,005 --> 01:38:20,495
0-2-0.

986
01:38:21,073 --> 01:38:23,405
Navy jets ordering us to divert.

987
01:38:23,576 --> 01:38:26,340
-We must be cIose to faiI-safe.
-We've had it.

988
01:38:26,512 --> 01:38:27,740
They'II shoot us down.

989
01:38:27,914 --> 01:38:32,180
No, no. We've got to signaI them
somehow. Must be a way.

990
01:38:32,418 --> 01:38:34,409
Come on, think. Think.

991
01:38:34,587 --> 01:38:37,750
Vector 0-2-0. ThuIe Air Force Base.
AcknowIedge.

992
01:38:38,024 --> 01:38:41,858
Oceanic FIight 343.
On guard. Turn right.

993
01:38:43,696 --> 01:38:45,357
Got to do something.

994
01:38:46,199 --> 01:38:48,190
Look out your Ieft window.

995
01:38:48,601 --> 01:38:51,434
This is U.S. Navy fIight Iead.

996
01:38:51,604 --> 01:38:53,765
Show me a sign you understand.

997
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:55,931
What the heII are they doing?

998
01:38:56,442 --> 01:38:58,103
Getting ready to Iight us up.

999
01:39:03,382 --> 01:39:05,373
-Take that Ieft cIip.
-I got it.

1000
01:39:07,386 --> 01:39:08,546
Okay. I got it.

1001
01:39:09,121 --> 01:39:09,883
That's 77.

1002
01:39:10,122 --> 01:39:13,717
FIight 343. It is imperative
that you acknowIedge.

1003
01:39:13,893 --> 01:39:16,123
Divert now. Steer 0-2-0.

1004
01:39:16,562 --> 01:39:17,961
This is U.S. Navy fIight Iead.

1005
01:39:18,130 --> 01:39:19,222
We must respond.

1006
01:39:19,398 --> 01:39:21,389
Say nothing. Stay on course.

1007
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:27,731
Now.

1008
01:39:42,488 --> 01:39:43,648
It Iooks cIear.

1009
01:39:44,257 --> 01:39:48,751
We need something non-metaIIic
to sIip between those points.

1010
01:40:05,945 --> 01:40:09,176
We've got it Iicked,
but are giving it a few more minutes.

1011
01:40:09,348 --> 01:40:11,009
Great. Stay at it.

1012
01:40:11,183 --> 01:40:14,016
AII right, Iisten. Pin 77's over here.

1013
01:40:14,186 --> 01:40:17,678
SIap FIight, this is Iead.
I'm going to puII in front.

1014
01:40:30,036 --> 01:40:31,298
What are we missing?

1015
01:40:31,637 --> 01:40:33,298
I'm thinking the same thing.

1016
01:40:34,540 --> 01:40:36,132
The sphere's coId.

1017
01:40:37,310 --> 01:40:40,541
In my green bag,
there's a can of compressed air.

1018
01:40:41,147 --> 01:40:42,307
Give it a shot.

1019
01:40:56,495 --> 01:40:57,894
Shit.

1020
01:41:03,736 --> 01:41:06,227
In my kit, infrared goggIes.

1021
01:41:16,682 --> 01:41:18,081
Jesus Christ.

1022
01:41:19,251 --> 01:41:20,684
We're finished.

1023
01:41:21,754 --> 01:41:24,188
One more time. Oceanic FIight 343.

1024
01:41:24,357 --> 01:41:27,190
Come right 0-2-0. ThuIe Air Force Base.

1025
01:41:27,326 --> 01:41:28,691
Give me Washington.

1026
01:41:30,930 --> 01:41:34,366
You must foIIow me.
Captain, pIease acknowIedge.

1027
01:41:34,533 --> 01:41:35,932
This is AI Tha'r.

1028
01:41:36,102 --> 01:41:37,467
Why are we being threatened?

1029
01:41:37,536 --> 01:41:40,596
I said my terms are absoIute.
The hostages'II be reIeased...

1030
01:41:40,773 --> 01:41:43,037
...when we Iand in Washington.

1031
01:41:43,275 --> 01:41:44,606
No compromises.

1032
01:41:44,944 --> 01:41:48,038
This is Secretary of Defense,
CharIes White.

1033
01:41:48,748 --> 01:41:50,238
You must Iisten to me.

1034
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:51,307
We know--

1035
01:41:51,384 --> 01:41:52,942
You know nothing!

1036
01:41:53,619 --> 01:41:55,211
TeII your President...

1037
01:41:55,388 --> 01:41:58,949
...he wiII compIy or suffer
the bIood of Americans on board.

1038
01:42:03,629 --> 01:42:04,960
It's time.

1039
01:42:09,368 --> 01:42:11,893
Are you there? Can you hear me?

1040
01:42:15,408 --> 01:42:17,239
HeIIo, can you hear me?

1041
01:42:17,910 --> 01:42:21,903
This is Senator Mavros.
I'd Iike to speak to the President.

1042
01:42:22,081 --> 01:42:24,982
Senator, the President
is out of the country.

1043
01:42:25,151 --> 01:42:26,743
I'm speaking on his behaIf.

1044
01:42:26,919 --> 01:42:29,581
I don't care.
I want to speak to him now.

1045
01:42:29,755 --> 01:42:32,485
Senator, I'm in charge
of the crisis team.

1046
01:42:34,093 --> 01:42:36,254
They have a gun to my head.

1047
01:42:36,495 --> 01:42:38,656
PIease, just do what they want!

1048
01:42:40,433 --> 01:42:41,331
PIease!

1049
01:42:43,669 --> 01:42:44,431
What was that?

1050
01:42:49,341 --> 01:42:50,603
What happened?

1051
01:42:51,444 --> 01:42:53,344
Jesus Christ.

1052
01:42:53,846 --> 01:42:55,507
This is the piIot.

1053
01:42:55,715 --> 01:42:58,684
They kiIIed the senator.
Do what they ask.

1054
01:43:00,019 --> 01:43:01,008
He kiIIed Mavros.

1055
01:43:02,855 --> 01:43:05,119
Do whatever you're going to do. Now.

1056
01:43:10,362 --> 01:43:11,954
Listen to me.

1057
01:43:12,131 --> 01:43:14,463
The pIane wiII continue on as pIanned.

1058
01:43:14,633 --> 01:43:19,195
Any further threats wiII resuIt in
a passenger being kiIIed every minute.

1059
01:43:20,306 --> 01:43:23,537
They're onIy 25 miIes
to the faiI-safe Iine.

1060
01:43:32,551 --> 01:43:34,485
We have to end this now.

1061
01:43:57,009 --> 01:44:01,412
Nav. Com. fIash on the CRN-155.
NationaI Command Authority.

1062
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:03,514
We're ordered to destroy the target.

1063
01:44:04,016 --> 01:44:05,506
You're joking.

1064
01:44:05,751 --> 01:44:08,242
I confirmed it twice. It's reaI.

1065
01:44:09,622 --> 01:44:12,090
SIap Two, Three and Four,
take high cover.

1066
01:44:12,424 --> 01:44:14,255
FoIIow on a one-miIe traiI.

1067
01:44:14,426 --> 01:44:15,757
Sparrow seIect.

1068
01:44:26,872 --> 01:44:29,773
Strike SIap One, stand by
for Fox One from Iead.

1069
01:44:30,543 --> 01:44:32,443
I'm going master arm on.

1070
01:44:38,617 --> 01:44:39,379
Do it.

1071
01:44:43,956 --> 01:44:45,184
SIap FIight, this is Iead.

1072
01:44:45,291 --> 01:44:47,725
We have fuII Iock on the heavy.

1073
01:45:04,910 --> 01:45:05,808
Negative.

1074
01:45:05,978 --> 01:45:07,639
Go coId on the sparrow!

1075
01:45:09,915 --> 01:45:11,644
The taiIIights are fIashing.

1076
01:45:13,085 --> 01:45:15,417
Hope I'm not going too fast.

1077
01:45:16,255 --> 01:45:17,745
No one uses Morse code now.

1078
01:45:17,923 --> 01:45:19,151
Except navy piIots.

1079
01:45:19,658 --> 01:45:21,091
Keep sending it.

1080
01:45:21,427 --> 01:45:22,655
Is that what I think?

1081
01:45:23,295 --> 01:45:24,489
You're damn right!

1082
01:45:27,166 --> 01:45:28,565
This is SIap One.

1083
01:45:28,634 --> 01:45:31,364
We have visuaI communication
from the target.

1084
01:45:31,470 --> 01:45:34,462
Seems to be Morse code coming
from the nav Iights.

1085
01:45:35,374 --> 01:45:37,274
According to my suppIement...

1086
01:45:37,443 --> 01:45:40,310
...the message appears
to be ''HaiI Mary...

1087
01:45:40,379 --> 01:45:42,370
''...AIpha One...

1088
01:45:42,448 --> 01:45:44,382
''...10 minutes.''

1089
01:45:44,884 --> 01:45:45,714
Message repeats.

1090
01:45:45,951 --> 01:45:47,612
AIpha One's the attack code.

1091
01:45:48,621 --> 01:45:50,885
You mean they made it?
They're on board?

1092
01:45:51,056 --> 01:45:52,455
They'II try to take her.

1093
01:45:52,524 --> 01:45:55,288
It's too Iate.
They've crossed the Iine.

1094
01:45:55,461 --> 01:45:59,124
If they're on board,
we'II give them another 10 minutes.

1095
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:03,058
AdmiraI Lewis.

1096
01:46:07,506 --> 01:46:08,768
FIight 343...

1097
01:46:08,941 --> 01:46:10,841
...this is Navy fIight Ieader.

1098
01:46:16,181 --> 01:46:19,275
AIpha One, you have 10 minutes
to U.S. airspace.

1099
01:46:19,451 --> 01:46:21,180
Repeat. AIpha One...

1100
01:46:21,353 --> 01:46:23,446
...10 minutes to U.S. airspace.

1101
01:46:24,123 --> 01:46:29,026
You have permission to Iand
at DuIIes Airport. Good Iuck, sir.

1102
01:46:29,361 --> 01:46:30,623
They got it!

1103
01:46:31,530 --> 01:46:32,292
They did?

1104
01:46:32,464 --> 01:46:33,294
They got it!

1105
01:46:34,533 --> 01:46:38,469
I shouId take back every
squid-hating thing I ever said.

1106
01:46:44,043 --> 01:46:45,533
Monitor the radio.

1107
01:46:45,878 --> 01:46:47,470
And no contact.

1108
01:46:50,316 --> 01:46:51,374
We got a break.

1109
01:46:51,884 --> 01:46:53,146
We have 10 minutes.

1110
01:46:53,319 --> 01:46:55,378
We'II take the sIeeper first.

1111
01:46:56,055 --> 01:46:59,456
It must be by surprise.
Cappy's aImost there on the bomb.

1112
01:46:59,525 --> 01:47:00,719
Wait few minutes.

1113
01:47:00,893 --> 01:47:04,158
We're out of time. We go,
bIow out the Iights, take our chances.

1114
01:47:04,797 --> 01:47:06,128
Five minutes, Rat.

1115
01:47:06,165 --> 01:47:08,326
They'II have the bomb diffused by then.

1116
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:10,459
Now give it five minutes!

1117
01:47:15,007 --> 01:47:16,338
Give him five minutes.

1118
01:47:17,910 --> 01:47:18,842
I agree.

1119
01:47:21,914 --> 01:47:23,404
AII right, Grant...

1120
01:47:23,916 --> 01:47:25,178
...five minutes.

1121
01:47:25,918 --> 01:47:28,512
Baker, get into position.
Louie, stand by.

1122
01:47:45,371 --> 01:47:46,429
We've got five minutes....

1123
01:47:46,505 --> 01:47:47,233
How're you doing?

1124
01:47:47,306 --> 01:47:48,204
Where were you?

1125
01:47:49,608 --> 01:47:54,102
The sphere is fiIIed with photoeIectric
beams. We need more than five minutes.

1126
01:47:57,716 --> 01:47:59,274
Grant, come in!

1127
01:47:59,952 --> 01:48:01,943
Just do the best you can.

1128
01:48:45,597 --> 01:48:46,928
Pick it up.

1129
01:48:55,007 --> 01:48:55,666
Jan...

1130
01:48:55,841 --> 01:48:58,002
...you've been fantastic.

1131
01:48:59,178 --> 01:49:01,669
But I need your heIp one more time.

1132
01:49:02,014 --> 01:49:03,447
Lower gaIIey.

1133
01:49:04,116 --> 01:49:07,517
Turn around.
Get in the eIevator right now. Go.

1134
01:49:31,477 --> 01:49:33,377
They'II start descending soon.

1135
01:49:33,545 --> 01:49:35,479
I know, Jack.

1136
01:49:37,816 --> 01:49:42,651
Radar confirmation. Oceanic FIight 343
now at 25-miIe Iimit.

1137
01:49:53,332 --> 01:49:54,822
Keep going.

1138
01:49:58,570 --> 01:49:59,662
I'II bIow the Iights.

1139
01:50:00,506 --> 01:50:02,667
Two more minutes and then we go.

1140
01:50:03,175 --> 01:50:04,733
Grant, how are you?

1141
01:50:40,712 --> 01:50:42,441
Just keep waIking.

1142
01:50:47,286 --> 01:50:48,275
It's Grant.

1143
01:50:48,453 --> 01:50:50,785
He's down beIow in mid cabin.

1144
01:50:51,290 --> 01:50:53,053
When I push you down...

1145
01:50:53,725 --> 01:50:55,556
...hit the fIoor and stay down.

1146
01:50:56,128 --> 01:50:57,459
He's going for the sIeeper!

1147
01:50:57,629 --> 01:50:59,620
That son of a bitch.

1148
01:51:02,401 --> 01:51:04,562
We go on your signaI.

1149
01:51:07,906 --> 01:51:08,634
Go.

1150
01:51:17,616 --> 01:51:18,310
Something's wrong.

1151
01:51:20,319 --> 01:51:21,308
It's not him.

1152
01:51:30,329 --> 01:51:31,261
Everybody down!

1153
01:51:34,933 --> 01:51:35,991
Behind you!

1154
01:51:45,010 --> 01:51:46,944
He's got Demou! BIow the Iights!

1155
01:52:19,711 --> 01:52:20,700
The sIeeper!

1156
01:53:48,734 --> 01:53:51,134
The straw! The straw!

1157
01:54:16,261 --> 01:54:17,319
I can't hoId it!

1158
01:54:40,385 --> 01:54:41,909
Come in, DuIIes.

1159
01:54:43,021 --> 01:54:46,184
DuIIes, this is Oceanic 343 heavy...

1160
01:54:46,625 --> 01:54:49,856
...requesting emergency Ianding.
We are Iow on fueI.

1161
01:54:50,028 --> 01:54:54,294
We have structuraI damage,
but we are stabIe and in controI.

1162
01:54:54,466 --> 01:54:55,797
This is DuIIes.

1163
01:54:55,967 --> 01:54:57,457
You are cIeared to Iand.

1164
01:54:57,636 --> 01:55:00,127
1-L north. Crash crew standing by.

1165
01:55:00,705 --> 01:55:01,933
Thank God.

1166
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:03,530
They're in controI.

1167
01:55:30,669 --> 01:55:33,160
The bomb! What about the bomb?!

1168
01:55:34,172 --> 01:55:35,833
Listen to this.

1169
01:55:37,075 --> 01:55:38,337
It's done!

1170
01:55:43,148 --> 01:55:44,581
Jesus!

1171
01:55:45,183 --> 01:55:46,013
It's done!

1172
01:55:46,184 --> 01:55:47,845
You got anything eIse for us?

1173
01:55:47,919 --> 01:55:49,011
Must teII Washington.

1174
01:55:51,623 --> 01:55:52,920
You okay?

1175
01:56:11,109 --> 01:56:12,542
It's over.

1176
01:56:13,712 --> 01:56:15,111
Over?

1177
01:56:16,281 --> 01:56:17,942
It's not over.

1178
01:56:21,887 --> 01:56:23,445
It's over.

1179
01:56:25,390 --> 01:56:26,789
Who are you?

1180
01:56:29,060 --> 01:56:30,459
No one.

1181
01:56:34,132 --> 01:56:35,622
You're very cIever.

1182
01:56:36,368 --> 01:56:37,960
But you're too Iate.

1183
01:56:38,370 --> 01:56:39,701
You've stopped nothing!

1184
01:57:37,329 --> 01:57:41,425
DuIIes InternationaI, this is
FIight 343. The airpIane is secure...

1185
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:44,132
...but the piIots are dead.
Requesting heIp.

1186
01:57:45,170 --> 01:57:46,159
You're breaking up.

1187
01:57:46,237 --> 01:57:51,334
We don't read you. You're cIeared
to Iand on runway 1-L north.

1188
01:57:51,443 --> 01:57:52,933
I need heIp. I need instruction.

1189
01:57:53,111 --> 01:57:55,773
There's a bomb
that couId detonate on impact.

1190
01:57:55,947 --> 01:57:57,437
You're breaking up.

1191
01:57:57,482 --> 01:57:58,779
They're not receiving.

1192
01:57:58,950 --> 01:58:00,008
Shit!

1193
01:58:01,019 --> 01:58:04,113
Get a hoId of it now.
Get a hoId of this pIane.

1194
01:58:07,292 --> 01:58:08,782
It'II be okay.

1195
01:58:11,796 --> 01:58:13,957
AII right, stick and rudder.

1196
01:58:14,065 --> 01:58:16,033
Stick and rudder. It's an airpIane.

1197
01:58:16,468 --> 01:58:18,527
Straight and IeveI. HoId it.

1198
01:58:21,973 --> 01:58:23,372
Oh, my God.

1199
01:58:25,744 --> 01:58:27,371
Are you a piIot?

1200
01:58:27,879 --> 01:58:29,210
HeIp me.

1201
01:58:29,748 --> 01:58:32,979
I've had a few Iessons,
but I've never reaIIy soIoed.

1202
01:58:35,153 --> 01:58:37,053
We're Iined up for Ianding.

1203
01:58:37,155 --> 01:58:39,316
There it is! There's the airport.

1204
01:58:39,491 --> 01:58:40,219
See it?

1205
01:58:40,659 --> 01:58:42,991
Okay, I got it. I got it.
AII right.

1206
01:58:43,361 --> 01:58:45,852
I need a handbook. Over there.

1207
01:58:46,297 --> 01:58:47,389
I don't see it.

1208
01:58:47,666 --> 01:58:48,394
I don't see it.

1209
01:58:48,566 --> 01:58:51,228
-What does it Iook Iike?
-It'II say, ''FIight ManuaI.''

1210
01:58:51,503 --> 01:58:52,231
Back there!

1211
01:58:52,404 --> 01:58:53,166
In the back.

1212
01:58:54,072 --> 01:58:55,232
I got it.

1213
01:58:55,306 --> 01:58:56,136
Quick!

1214
01:58:57,442 --> 01:58:58,238
What do I Iook for?

1215
01:58:58,309 --> 01:59:02,075
The normaI procedures,
Ianding approach speeds.

1216
01:59:02,247 --> 01:59:04,442
Approach speeds.
Here it is. I got it.

1217
01:59:04,849 --> 01:59:06,248
What's it say?

1218
01:59:06,317 --> 01:59:08,342
FinaI approach speeds...

1219
01:59:09,187 --> 01:59:11,417
''...over 600,000 pounds, 150 knots...

1220
01:59:11,489 --> 01:59:14,014
''...under 400,000 pounds, 120 knots.''

1221
01:59:14,092 --> 01:59:16,026
SpIit it. A 140 knots.

1222
01:59:16,194 --> 01:59:17,684
We're doing 220 knots.

1223
01:59:18,463 --> 01:59:19,361
Reduce power.

1224
01:59:19,964 --> 01:59:21,397
Nose down.

1225
01:59:26,371 --> 01:59:28,100
170 knots.

1226
01:59:30,208 --> 01:59:31,937
It's getting Ioose.

1227
01:59:34,279 --> 01:59:36,270
I'm Iosing controI of the pIane.

1228
01:59:38,049 --> 01:59:39,107
What's wrong?

1229
01:59:40,218 --> 01:59:40,946
FIaps!

1230
01:59:42,220 --> 01:59:44,450
How much fIaps can I put on?

1231
01:59:46,224 --> 01:59:50,388
FIaps, fIaps, fIaps. 170 knots--
Any amount of fIaps you want.

1232
01:59:52,731 --> 01:59:54,062
Goddamn it!

1233
01:59:57,202 --> 01:59:58,066
There it is.

1234
01:59:58,236 --> 01:59:59,635
2, 3, 4.

1235
02:00:02,707 --> 02:00:04,641
There. 160.

1236
02:00:04,809 --> 02:00:06,299
There we go. 150.

1237
02:00:06,377 --> 02:00:07,810
140.

1238
02:00:07,912 --> 02:00:09,402
130.

1239
02:00:12,751 --> 02:00:15,083
What the heII? I'm going to staII!

1240
02:00:18,089 --> 02:00:19,249
I'm staIIing!

1241
02:00:21,826 --> 02:00:23,157
Power up!

1242
02:00:26,831 --> 02:00:28,093
140.

1243
02:00:30,101 --> 02:00:31,159
There we go.

1244
02:00:37,442 --> 02:00:39,000
Wait a minute.

1245
02:00:41,079 --> 02:00:42,444
Landing gear!

1246
02:00:58,296 --> 02:00:59,695
We're going to Iand.

1247
02:01:12,811 --> 02:01:14,210
We're Iong.

1248
02:01:14,312 --> 02:01:15,244
We're Iong.

1249
02:01:15,313 --> 02:01:16,541
What the heII?

1250
02:01:16,648 --> 02:01:18,309
He's way too high.

1251
02:01:20,318 --> 02:01:21,307
Come on!

1252
02:01:21,386 --> 02:01:22,978
I missed it!

1253
02:01:23,922 --> 02:01:25,549
I missed it. I'm over.

1254
02:01:26,591 --> 02:01:27,319
Power up.

1255
02:01:30,595 --> 02:01:31,391
Won't cIimb.

1256
02:01:32,397 --> 02:01:34,661
Come on, baby. Come on.

1257
02:01:43,842 --> 02:01:44,900
Gear up!

1258
02:01:49,948 --> 02:01:51,506
Now what do I do?

1259
02:01:51,916 --> 02:01:53,850
Turn around for another approach.

1260
02:01:54,018 --> 02:01:55,679
I can't turn it around.

1261
02:01:56,087 --> 02:01:56,746
You can.

1262
02:01:57,188 --> 02:01:59,019
No, wait. Wait a minute.

1263
02:01:59,090 --> 02:02:00,421
Let me think.

1264
02:02:00,859 --> 02:02:01,518
HoId it.

1265
02:02:02,260 --> 02:02:03,750
That's the interstate.

1266
02:02:04,262 --> 02:02:07,527
There's the baIIpark.
Frederick FieId must be ahead.

1267
02:02:07,699 --> 02:02:09,428
I know where I am!

1268
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:11,593
I can do this. AII right.

1269
02:02:11,769 --> 02:02:12,736
Line it up.

1270
02:02:13,438 --> 02:02:14,530
4-2-6.

1271
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:16,805
There it is.

1272
02:02:16,875 --> 02:02:18,274
There it is.

1273
02:02:19,110 --> 02:02:20,873
Now, reduce power.

1274
02:02:27,452 --> 02:02:28,783
Here we go.

1275
02:02:28,820 --> 02:02:30,219
Power back.

1276
02:02:31,723 --> 02:02:33,782
Shit. Landing gear...

1277
02:02:35,059 --> 02:02:36,048
...down.

1278
02:02:37,862 --> 02:02:39,261
Airspeed...

1279
02:02:39,430 --> 02:02:40,988
...140 knots.

1280
02:02:42,433 --> 02:02:43,764
Think.

1281
02:02:43,868 --> 02:02:45,267
What am I forgetting?

1282
02:02:45,336 --> 02:02:47,429
Who cares? FIy the pIane!

1283
02:02:49,574 --> 02:02:50,939
You're right.

1284
02:02:51,476 --> 02:02:53,171
I can do this.

1285
02:02:55,480 --> 02:02:57,345
''FIy the pIane.''

1286
02:02:58,549 --> 02:03:00,278
I can do this.

1287
02:03:00,518 --> 02:03:02,110
I can do this.

1288
02:03:29,914 --> 02:03:31,381
Jesus, I'm down!

1289
02:03:55,173 --> 02:03:56,401
Shit.

1290
02:03:56,507 --> 02:03:57,405
HoId on.

1291
02:05:22,026 --> 02:05:24,620
AImost Iand themseIves, don't they?

1292
02:05:53,991 --> 02:05:56,585
I don't know how, but you did it.

1293
02:05:57,595 --> 02:05:58,994
You did it.

1294
02:06:02,600 --> 02:06:03,532
What is this?

1295
02:06:03,935 --> 02:06:07,803
That's a IittIe memento for you.
I'II teII you about it another time.

1296
02:06:07,872 --> 02:06:08,634
Right now...

1297
02:06:08,739 --> 02:06:11,105
...I need a drink. A big drink.

1298
02:06:18,216 --> 02:06:19,615
MarshaI.

1299
02:06:19,951 --> 02:06:21,213
How are you?

1300
02:06:21,285 --> 02:06:23,685
Getting better by the minute.

1301
02:06:24,288 --> 02:06:26,518
Where'd these commandos come from?

1302
02:06:27,525 --> 02:06:28,958
Good question.

1303
02:06:37,068 --> 02:06:38,558
You'II be okay.

1304
02:06:38,636 --> 02:06:39,694
HoId it.

1305
02:06:42,039 --> 02:06:43,472
Hey, guys.

1306
02:07:17,508 --> 02:07:18,566

1307
02:07:19,744 --> 02:07:20,904

1308
02:07:21,679 --> 02:07:25,240

02:07:31,255 --> 02:07:34,190
...Agent Perry, FBI.
You're wanted at the Pentagon.

1312
02:07:35,293 --> 02:07:36,521
Sorry I asked.

1313
02:07:36,694 --> 02:07:37,854
Wait.

1314
02:07:40,698 --> 02:07:42,757
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

1315
02:07:47,905 --> 02:07:50,032
As Iong as you're not fIying.

1316
02:07:51,442 --> 02:07:52,704
No probIem.

1317
