1
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,159
<i>I'll tell you the story of my journey.</i>

2
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,908
<i>Where I went, how I got there,</i>

3
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,660
<i>and what I saw along the way.</i>

4
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:32,215
<i>I thought I was going to change the world.</i>

5
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,924
<i>But, of course,</i>
<i>it was the world that changed me.</i>

6
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,968
We need a doctor! Please help!

7
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,887
- You can't be in here.
- Please!

8
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,970
- We need help.
- Here. This way. This way.

9
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,063
- They can't be in here!
- It's all right.

10
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,142
- What happened to him?
- Drill bit broke loose.

11
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,691
- Hang on, Sam.
- Hold on. You're gonna be all right.

12
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,109
- You'll be all right, Sam.
- Help me, please.

13
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,903
- They don't belong here.
- What are you doing?

14
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,027
- He's bleeding to death.
- He can't be in here!

15
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:01,118
Help me!

16
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,363
- What is going on?
- Doctor, he has a deep puncture.

17
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,239
This man is in the wrong hospital.

18
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,991
He doesn't have time for the right one.

19
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,915
- Get him out of here. Quickly!
- He's bleeding to death!

20
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,004
- He's bleeding!
- This isn't right!

21
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,626
Move it! Move it! Get him out!

22
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,213
- What is wrong with you?
- Take him down the back stairs.

23
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,385
This way.

24
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,992
<i>It gives me great pleasure</i>
<i>to introduce our speaker and friend,</i>

25
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,530
<i>Dr Jude Gresham.</i>

26
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:49,663
Thank you.

27
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:57,501
Eastern Anatolia is a rugged country.
Its people are poor but hard-working.

28
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:05,309
For them, modern medicine
is a revolutionary concept.

29
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,392
You might have changed out of that uniform.

30
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,638
- Sorry. I didn't have time.
- Shh!

31
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:13,016
That is why the work of
the American Mission Hospital in Van

32
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,017
is so vitally important.

33
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,403
For many people in the region,

34
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,148
our hospital offers
the only medical care available.

35
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,444
People come from hundreds of miles around.

36
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,455
And the only reason
we are able to provide for them

37
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:32,668
is because of generous donations from
open-hearted Christians like yourselves.

38
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,627
There are impediments, of course.

39
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:43,964
Eastern Anatolia can be a place of
unspeakable violence and transgression.

40
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,719
But it is also a place of fierce spirit.

41
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,848
And the people who have survived there...

42
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:11,666
When I first came to Van
as a newly graduated doctor,

43
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,457
my plan was to stay a year, do my service,

44
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,673
and then come back to the States
and open a prosperous practice.

45
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,421
Well, that was eight years ago.

46
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,055
I didn't intend for it to happen,

47
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:30,427
but once I got to know these people
and live among them,

48
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,394
I knew I would never leave.

49
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,401
Thank you.

50
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,791
- Sounds like a whirlwind.
- It has been a whirlwind.

51
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,002
I've been visiting hospitals
in various cities,

52
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,746
catching up on the latest advancements
in modern medicine.

53
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,341
It's true. Medical science
has been making amazing advances.

54
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,088
If only we could advance
the thinking of the doctors.

55
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,431
- Lillie...
- How do you mean, miss?

56
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,805
Yesterday, a man was turned away
from the hospital where I work

57
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,725
because his skin was the wrong colour.

58
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,473
Dr Gresham, I have to apologise
for our daughter.

59
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,693
I assure you, Miss Rowe, no one has ever
been turned away from our hospital

60
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:24,110
due to the colour of their skin
or their religious beliefs.

61
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,029
That would be against
everything we believe in.

62
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,619
Dr Gresham, I'd like to show you something.

63
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,418
Isn't it beautiful?

64
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:50,640
- It's very handsome.
- It was my brother's.

65
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,935
He was training to be a doctor when he died.

66
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,852
- I'm sorry, Miss Rowe.
- I want to donate it to your mission.

67
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,526
- Hm...
- You can use a truck, can't you?

68
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:05,442
Of course. And I appreciate the offer.

69
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:09,659
But there's no way
to get this to our hospital.

70
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,781
Why not?

71
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:15,031
Well, for one thing, the railroad
only goes a third of the way

72
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:19,035
and the roads are just rough trails
cut through the mountains.

73
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,752
Goat paths, really.

74
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,590
I'll find a way to get it there.

75
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,259
I want it to serve a purpose.

76
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,517
Are you sure it isn't you that wants
to serve a purpose, Miss Rowe?

77
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:38,979
I suppose I'm looking for something,
some way to contribute.

78
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,109
Well, whatever that is,
I'm sure you'll find it.

79
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,155
I hope we meet again one day.

80
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,324
I hope so too.

81
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,239
Europe's on the verge of war.

82
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,610
There's no guarantee that the truck
or the medical supplies

83
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,283
would ever reach Dr Gresham's hospital.

84
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,116
What if I took them myself?

85
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,494
What do you mean?

86
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,246
Sail to Istanbul and make sure
they get the rest of the way.

87
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,253
- What, deliver them in person?
- Yes.

88
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,627
Lillie, your heart's in the right place,

89
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,924
but this journey, it's far too dangerous.

90
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:56,265
Oh, it's unimaginable. Out of the question.

91
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,894
A young woman on her own
in that part of the world.

92
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,058
No.

93
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,818
I've already made the arrangements.

94
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,481
- You did what?
- I've already booked the passage

95
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,699
for myself and the supplies.

96
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,823
I used my inheritance from Grandmother.

97
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:20,414
- Lillie, it's not a matter of money.
- You're 23 years old.

98
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,751
All your friends are married
and raising families.

99
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,542
Now, up until now, we've indulged your whims.

100
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,587
- Whims?
- Nursing school.

101
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,255
Your work with the poor.

102
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:36,301
Lillie, it's time to settle down, not
run away to the other side of the world.

103
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,926
I'm sorry, dear.
We cannot possibly allow this.

104
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,019
Absolutely not.

105
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,810
I love you both.

106
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,065
But this is something I have to do.

107
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,023
Lillie? Lillie?

108
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,794
- Miss Rowe?
- Hm-hm?

109
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,885
- Your goods will be unloaded shortly.
- Thank you, Thomas.

110
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,078
Sir?

111
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,746
Sir? Excuse me?

112
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,542
Ignore him. Keep moving.

113
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,419
I'm sorry?

114
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:21,262
Special "welcome to Istanbul" greeting.
He drops the brush, you pick it up,

115
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,427
and suddenly you're getting the most
expensive shoeshine in the world.

116
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,097
I'm sorry, sir. I'm all right, thank you.

117
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,350
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

118
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,023
- Are you American?
- Yes. I...

119
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:42,025
I wanted to see the mosque.
Could you tell me how to get there?

120
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,120
Well, I could.
It might be easier if I just show you.

121
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:50,161
Come on. You don't want to miss the most
beautiful mosque in Istanbul, do you?

122
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:52,830
Come on!

123
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,833
Take off your shoes and cover your hair.

124
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:17,545
It's like being inside God's thoughts.

125
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:28,051
It appears our time inside
God's thoughts has come to an end.

126
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,558
Goodbye.

127
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,020
Thank you, Mr...?

128
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,107
Lieutenant Ismail Veli
of the Ottoman Imperial Army.

129
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,983
When I'm not playing tour guide
to young American ladies.

130
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,022
Lillian Rowe.

131
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:49,619
Well... I hope your visit to my country
is a pleasant one, Miss Rowe.

132
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,989
Pleasant but brief. There's a war coming.

133
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,803
I'm sorry, Miss Rowe,
but I can no longer guarantee delivery.

134
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,095
The Ottoman Empire may be entering
a state of war any day now.

135
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:16,516
Goods intended for the American missions
are being detained.

136
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,974
Your only choice is to return home.

137
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,148
I didn't come this far
just to turn around now.

138
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:28,240
There may be one way
in which you can obtain permission.

139
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,404
Yes?

140
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,494
You would need to find a military escort.

141
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,909
Uncle, this is ridiculous.

142
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:43,881
The American girl requested you by name.
Think of it as an opportunity.

143
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:48,343
An opportunity? This hospital
is in the middle of nowhere.

144
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:53,683
Once this war begins, Russia will try
to expand its borders into Anatolia.

145
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,521
The question is whether the Armenians
in the region will stand with the empire

146
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,355
or join the Russians against us.

147
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,726
Ah. So you want me to be a spy?

148
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,978
Let us be honest with each other.

149
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:10,066
Your name and your charm
have carried you this far.

150
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,744
But now it's time for you to prove yourself.

151
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:19,579
All right.

152
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,975
I just don't know when I'll be back.
We'll see.

153
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,606
Lieutenant Veli.

154
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,230
I can't thank you enough for your help.

155
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,112
Actually, Miss Rowe, it's I
who should be thanking you.

156
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,608
This is a great opportunity
to put aside my military career

157
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:57,989
and help you drag your boxes and your
ridiculous truck to the edge of nowhere.

158
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:44,914
Lieutenant Veli.

159
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:52,300
I am sorry if this trip interferes
with your grand plans for yourself,

160
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:56,092
but given that your countrymen
are in desperate need of medical help,

161
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:59,262
you might think about their needs
instead of your own.

162
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,555
Erm...

163
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,895
You can't be here.

164
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,002
Miss Rowe!

165
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,467
Miss Rowe! There are customs here.

166
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,178
You need to observe them
if you're going to get along.

167
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,423
Thank you, Lieutenant, for pointing that...

168
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:52,296
- You shouldn't wander off.
- I'm perfectly fine.

169
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:58,423
Is that Mount Ararat where Noah landed?

170
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:03,094
Yes. We call it Agri Dagi.

171
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,182
Agri Dagi.

172
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:09,305
Noah and the Great Flood. Adam and Eve.

173
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,524
You know, it's also
part of the Islamic culture.

174
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,688
- Really?
- Hm-hm.

175
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,606
- Adam and Eve?
- Hm-hm.

176
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:19,482
Only in the Islamic telling,
they weren't driven out of the garden.

177
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,234
They were placed
in different parts of the world,

178
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,487
so they had to search to find each other.

179
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,417
Please stay close.

180
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,773
Wake up. Wake up.

181
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:01,239
Whatever happens, don't show yourself.

182
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,699
Hide!

183
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,720
We're bringing medical supplies
to the American Mission Hospital.

184
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,844
It's just medicine and bandages
and supplies for people in need.

185
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,722
Your boots. Your boots are army.

186
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,106
They're just boots.

187
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,061
Drop the rifle, Turk.

188
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:49,538
I know who you are, soldier.
The question is, am I going to kill you?

189
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,325
Or will my Christian conscience prevent me?

190
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:57,045
Hey! Shall we kill this Turkish dog?

191
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,957
Get in!

192
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,425
Go, go, go!

193
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,177
Let's go! Let's go!

194
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,561
Yah! Yah!

195
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,196
Get him!

196
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,435
I can't control it!

197
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,855
Come on!

198
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,096
Miss Rowe, we are lucky.

199
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,184
- Lucky?
- Yes.

200
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:39,056
I lost the medical supplies.
I lost the truck. My brother's truck.

201
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,399
They would have taken those things anyway.

202
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:45,020
- One more thing they would have taken.
- And what's that?

203
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,612
Our lives.

204
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,848
- You can use this as a pillow.
- Thank you.

205
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,308
There.

206
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:21,273
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- Apologies for the arrangement.

207
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,489
I hope you'll be able to get some sleep.

208
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,754
Hello!

209
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,846
Hello!

210
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,721
How do you say "hello" in Turkish?

211
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,974
<i>Merhaba.</i>

212
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,691
<i>Merhaba.</i>

213
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,295
Is that the mission?

214
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:34,930
No. That's the garrison
where I've been posted.

215
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,094
Your mission hospital is over there.

216
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,397
Come.

217
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:03,283
Well, you made it.

218
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,126
Goodbye, Miss Rowe.

219
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,751
I hope we'll be able to see each other...

220
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,502
Miss Rowe?

221
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,427
What are you doing here?

222
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:23,562
- Really?
- Dr Gresham, it's a long story.

223
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,816
- Are you all right?
- I'm... I'm fine, actually.

224
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,356
And this is my escort, Lieutenant Veli.

225
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,446
- Lieutenant, this is Dr Gresham.
- Doctor.

226
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:39,241
Lieutenant.
Thank you for bringing her safely to us.

227
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,951
My pleasure.

228
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,874
Let's get you out of the sun, shall we?

229
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,956
Thank you, Lieutenant.

230
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,724
So what happened to you?

231
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:08,473
I was... I was bringing your medical supplies

232
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,226
- in my brother's truck, as I promised.
- You brought the truck?

233
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:15,822
Unfortunately it was stolen
in the mountains by bandits

234
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:19,033
along with all the supplies. I'm so sorry.

235
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:24,122
You're here. You're alive.
That's what counts. Come on.

236
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,249
Since I can't deliver the supplies, I...

237
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:35,216
- I'd like to volunteer my services.
- You want to be a nurse here?

238
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:38,178
- Well, you need nurses, don't you?
- Badly.

239
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,593
- That's Dr Woodruff, our founder.
- Could I meet him?

240
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,604
Of course.

241
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,438
Garrett.

242
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:59,028
- What is it? Who's this?
- Her name is Lillian Rowe.

243
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,277
She's come from Philadelphia
to bring us valuable medical supplies.

244
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:05,996
I'm afraid there was a problem with
the supplies, but I'd like to stay...

245
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,744
Stay? You can't stay.

246
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,619
What is she talking about, Gresham?

247
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,038
She's a trained nurse, Garrett.

248
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,917
And she's volunteered her services.
We can't afford to...

249
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,044
Miss Rowe?

250
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,430
Go home.

251
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:25,846
Go home immediately.

252
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,687
Is everyone one around here
losing their mind but me?

253
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,780
This is no place for a woman.

254
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:52,077
I apologise.
Dr Woodruff can be a little blunt.

255
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,713
- Would you like to see the main ward?
- Yes.

256
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,584
As you can see, we have 24 beds active.

257
00:27:58,719 --> 00:27:59,926
- Doctor.
- Two in...

258
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,295
- Doctor.
- Excuse me.

259
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:13,477
Hello.

260
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,690
What's your name?

261
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,151
I'm Lillie.

262
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,237
And you are?

263
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:28,534
Aghavni.

264
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,247
That's a lovely name.

265
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,741
Aghavni.

266
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,250
What's that?

267
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,710
A... A bird?

268
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:45,050
Aghavni means "bird"?

269
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,048
Dove.

270
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,601
Aghavni means "dove".

271
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,846
Oh, oh, oh...

272
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:55,557
Is that malaria?

273
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,402
Malaria?

274
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,773
Pay attention to the symptoms.

275
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,400
The deep bronchial cough.

276
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:09,620
Body completely covered
in bright red rash. Hm?

277
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:13,742
It's typhus.

278
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,296
Not malaria.

279
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:26,259
You can't even recognise typhus.
Where did you get your training?

280
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,473
Dr Gresham! Doctor!

281
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,812
He does not breathe. He does not breathe.

282
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,981
- Take care of him, Zoya.
- He does not breathe.

283
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:52,371
- No respiration. No heartbeat.
- His pupils aren't contracted.

284
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,411
He's still alive.

285
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,580
Pleural abscess upper right quadrant.

286
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,125
It's crushing his heart and lungs.

287
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:01,122
Scalpel.

288
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,466
Gauze.

289
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,887
Gauze.

290
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:16,933
Forceps.

291
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,647
Gauze.

292
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,832
I'm gonna catch you, you little doll!

293
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:39,119
Caught you!

294
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:46,418
Caught you!

295
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,680
Zoya, can you keep an eye on her?

296
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,140
How did this happen?

297
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,645
Lillie. Lillie.

298
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,739
Let us deal with this.

299
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:13,988
Nurse Rowe, I believe you already
know our friend, Christapor.

300
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,742
Friend?

301
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:20,118
He's come here to sell us this fine
equipment, which we need very badly.

302
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,708
You expect to be paid
for what you've already stolen?

303
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,461
I came across these things in the mountains.

304
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,550
That's a lie. He's a thief. He's a bandit.

305
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:33,389
Young woman! Control yourself.
We're trying to conduct business here.

306
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,718
Very fine equipment.

307
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:40,437
But it doesn't matter.
We can't meet your price.

308
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,808
- My price is very reasonable.
- Your price is too high.

309
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:47,153
- I won't be extorted.
- Garrett, let me work something out.

310
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:50,823
We need this equipment.

311
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:53,910
Take Miss Rowe inside. Let me deal with it.

312
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,210
Christapor.

313
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,301
Is there anything else we could do for you?

314
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,591
I hope that's not a letter of resignation.

315
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:20,219
No, it's my parents.

316
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,934
I thought you'd be pleased.

317
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,103
Your brother's truck has finally arrived.

318
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,521
I don't understand making deals with thieves.

319
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,491
In the Armenian community, Christapor
and his men are considered heroes.

320
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:41,958
They're making a stand for Christianity
against the Turkish Muslims.

321
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,752
I thought we were supposed to be neutral.

322
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,961
This war in Europe...

323
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,552
is going to split Anatolia down the middle.

324
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,594
The Armenians on one side
and the Turks on the other.

325
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,849
It's going to be bloody.
A lot of people are going to die.

326
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:10,820
We're going to need your supplies
to help everyone.

327
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,617
Now do you understand why I had to do it?

328
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,072
I'm beginning to.

329
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,330
Good night.

330
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:39,548
<i># We are climbing Jacob's ladder</i>

331
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,185
<i># Soldiers of the cross</i>

332
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:54,153
<i># Every rung goes higher, higher</i>

333
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,617
<i># Soldiers of the cross</i>

334
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:05,538
<i># We are climbing higher, higher</i>

335
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,287
<i># We are climbing higher, higher</i>

336
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,506
<i># Soldiers of the cross</i>

337
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:23,551
<i># Sinners, do you love my Jesus?</i>

338
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:28,014
<i># Soldiers of the cross</i>

339
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,100
Hey!

340
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:40,318
My parents died when I was young.
I was attached to no one.

341
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,536
But you have a family.

342
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:45,657
My brother Frank was the only one
who really understood me.

343
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:51,083
- You told me he passed away.
- Tuberculosis.

344
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,625
I'm sorry, Lillie.

345
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,550
He was training to be a doctor.

346
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:05,351
So when he died,
I knew exactly what I wanted to do.

347
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:08,854
Frank would have loved this.

348
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,441
And you?

349
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:29,163
- Come on!
- What is it? I don't understand.

350
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,911
It's begun. They're killing each other now.

351
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:47,514
<i>Full-scale war was raging in Europe.</i>

352
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:52,898
<i>It became known as the First World War.</i>

353
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:55,518
<i>"The war to end all wars."</i>

354
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,941
<i>We read news about</i>
<i>the horrors and atrocities.</i>

355
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:05,911
<i>Trench warfare. No man's land.</i>

356
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,996
<i>Poison gas.</i>

357
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:11,701
<i>Dogfights in the air.</i>

358
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:16,418
<i>And often the battles took place</i>
<i>weeks or even months</i>

359
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,506
<i>before the news reached us.</i>

360
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:24,388
<i>Though it all seemed so very far away,</i>

361
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:28,476
<i>we knew we wouldn't escape</i>
<i>its bloody reach for long.</i>

362
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,641
At ease, Lieutenant.

363
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:20,107
I believe you are acquainted with Miss Rowe.

364
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:24,357
- Lieutenant Veli.
- Miss Rowe.

365
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:28,702
Miss Rowe will be returning a patient
to a village nearby in two days' time.

366
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,368
And I'm assigning you as her official escort.

367
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,872
It'd be a great honour to accompany you.

368
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,212
I'm pleased to hear it.

369
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:42,546
That'll be all, Lieutenant.
I'll make the proper arrangements.

370
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,413
Aghavni!

371
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,288
Yaya!

372
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:30,922
What happened here?

373
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:36,098
Men came. Many men. With guns and swords.

374
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:40,970
- Were they dressed like him?
- No. They were not soldiers.

375
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:49,900
- Have you any wounded?
- Yes.

376
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:07,542
Your friend, Lieutenant Veli,
isn't here to protect you.

377
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:10,508
He's here to gather information
on the outlying villages.

378
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,004
We can't leave Aghavni here.

379
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,265
We don't have a choice, Lillie.

380
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,391
The children are all they have now.

381
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,753
Is everything all right?

382
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,006
It's all right, but we need to leave soon.

383
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:43,475
Of course. You need to report back
to your superiors.

384
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,433
You have your mission, Doctor,
and I have mine.

385
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,477
My mission is saving lives.

386
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,691
And what? Mine is taking them?

387
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,687
Just because I wear a uniform
and carry a gun, that makes me a killer?

388
00:42:58,326 --> 00:42:59,783
Yes.

389
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,536
This wasn't done by my army.

390
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:08,917
These people are under your protection.

391
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:13,877
If you allow things like this to happen,
then you are supporting their cause.

392
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,044
What cause?

393
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,839
Driving all of the Christians
out of Anatolia!

394
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:22,806
- I would never support that.
- You already are.

395
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:26,344
You're a soldier and soldiers take orders,

396
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:28,846
no matter how many
innocent people are killed.

397
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,563
You don't know who I am.

398
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,567
I know it's men like you that spill the blood

399
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,860
that men like me are expected to clean up.

400
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,779
Please, both of you, stop!

401
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:50,534
We're leaving.

402
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,684
Now that you've seen it up close,

403
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:01,397
the way these people live and die,

404
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,318
no one would blame you
if you wanted to leave.

405
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:09,321
- You think I want to leave?
- No.

406
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:13,663
But now you understand
why the Armenians have to fight.

407
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:20,883
Is that why you're hiding guns for them?
In the chapel?

408
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:26,221
You think it's hypocrisy.

409
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:29,057
I can see you believe
it's the right thing to do.

410
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:30,642
Don't you?

411
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,770
I'm not sure.

412
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,519
Lillie.

413
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:44,235
In the short time you've been here,

414
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,321
I have begun to wonder.

415
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,194
Maybe this is a kind of...

416
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,869
Ah!

417
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,325
I'm interrupting.

418
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:03,341
- Have you had your supper?
- No, I don't suppose I have.

419
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,882
Well, here, sit down. I'll get it for you.

420
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:15,513
You should eat something, Garrett.
I'll take the evening rounds.

421
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:38,831
He's in love with you.

422
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,465
Would that be wrong?

423
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,052
I'd hate to see him disappointed.

424
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,223
I told you the first time I saw you.

425
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:53,888
This is no place for a woman.

426
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:58,264
I'm not afraid, Dr Woodruff.

427
00:46:58,858 --> 00:46:59,894
No.

428
00:47:02,111 --> 00:47:03,477
You're not afraid.

429
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:10,484
Neither was she.

430
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:20,623
I don't know your approach...

431
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:25,796
..to medicine, Miss Rowe.

432
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:34,092
Possibly you overflow with the nobility
of relieving human suffering.

433
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:40,806
You know my approach?

434
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:43,604
It's a game.

435
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:49,232
A bloody game.

436
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:52,451
In which we pit our puny brains and skills

437
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:57,039
against the forces of destruction
and disease and lose.

438
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,871
We are drowning in death.

439
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:09,547
I don't expect you to understand.

440
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,213
But you will.

441
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,377
The shard of glass is close.

442
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:59,430
He'll lose the eye if we're not precise.

443
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:15,988
Dr Gresham.

444
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,329
Garrett, let me finish this.

445
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:23,121
Perhaps, yes.
It's, erm... good training for you.

446
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:31,925
Hold his head.

447
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:37,840
Dr Woodruff?

448
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,492
Don't touch that.

449
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:13,504
Typhus.

450
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,679
I couldn't save them.

451
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:23,181
- I understand.
- You...

452
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:27,018
You... You don't understand.

453
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:34,692
You want to believe in a God
that's good and just.

454
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:39,113
He's not just. He's cruel.

455
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:41,828
He's cruel beyond imagining.

456
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,995
Let's get you to sleep.

457
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,130
All right.

458
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:01,343
What was your wife's name?

459
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,681
Marie.

460
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:12,062
And you started this hospital with her?

461
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:14,694
I did, yes.

462
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:20,275
Would she want you
to punish yourself like this?

463
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,233
- Good.
- Good.

464
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:06,366
How did you find me?

465
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:10,988
- Erm... I saw you from the fortress.
- You were watching me?

466
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:13,740
I was admiring the beauty of the landscape.

467
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:20,126
- Is that an island?
- Yes. It's called Ahtamar.

468
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,169
From here, it looks like a mirage.

469
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:25,760
There's an old church there. It's beautiful.

470
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:29,965
As a Christian, you'd be welcome.
With an official escort, of course.

471
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,309
Of course. Let's go.

472
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:40,896
For a few coins,
he might let us borrow his boat.

473
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:07,173
Being on the water always makes
the rest of the world go away.

474
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:12,966
It's like being inside God's thoughts.

475
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:22,650
It's beautiful here.

476
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,696
Thank you. It's my land.

477
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:32,785
Are you glad you came?

478
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:36,782
- To the island?
- No. To this.

479
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:41,829
- You're very brave.
- I was running away.

480
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:44,751
Why?

481
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:49,844
I couldn't be what other people
wanted me to be.

482
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,472
What about you?
Have you always wanted to be a soldier?

483
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:05,147
Well, I had no choice.

484
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:09,697
It's the family business.

485
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:10,861
You go too.

486
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:13,280
Nice.

487
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:17,785
Wouldn't you like to break free?

488
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:26,207
Freedom is an illusion.
We... we all take the role we're given.

489
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,798
I don't believe that.

490
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:31,094
Do you?

491
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:36,637
Less and less, every time I see you.

492
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:47,440
So much for a homeward breeze.

493
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:51,114
I don't mind floating for a while.

494
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:07,623
I've wanted to touch you
almost from the moment we met.

495
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:13,216
But I'm a Muslim and you're a Christian.

496
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:17,010
We share so little.

497
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,937
Were Adam and Eve Muslim?

498
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:27,559
- Or were they Christian?
- They were neither.

499
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,731
But they shared the same God.

500
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:50,419
How do you say "kiss" in Turkish?

501
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:55,052
<i>Buse.</i>

502
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:59,967
<i>Buse,</i> then.

503
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,893
Ha! It looks like we have wind.

504
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:30,727
- We were worried about you.
- I can assure you I was fine.

505
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:35,145
I'd like a word with Lieutenant Veli,
if I may.

506
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:39,569
Good afternoon, Miss Rowe.

507
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:42,281
Lieutenant.

508
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:47,786
Ah! Thank you.

509
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:51,252
You understand that the young lady
is under our care and protection.

510
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:56,549
Except when she leaves the city,
and then she's under mine.

511
00:59:56,676 --> 01:00:01,546
Let's be clear. Your religion frowns
on socialising with Christian women.

512
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:06,847
Miss Rowe and I are friends. Or is that
something your religion frowns on?

513
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:10,471
- I don't want her misled.
- Misled?

514
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,474
You know what I'm talking about.

515
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:18,522
Don't worry, Dr Gresham.
Her honour is intact.

516
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:20,819
What does that mean?

517
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:19,916
This is unacceptable.

518
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:22,543
I won't have it.

519
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:54,704
I want this dressing changed twice daily.

520
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,754
And watch him closely for signs of fever.

521
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:02,212
Jude.

522
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:04,836
Jude.

523
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,180
You're angry.

524
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,552
Of course I'm angry.

525
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:18,024
But I can't tell you what to do.

526
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,439
That's up to you and your conscience.

527
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:33,869
You and I know each other.

528
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,160
We share the same dreams.

529
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:41,167
The same beliefs.

530
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,337
We could make a life together.

531
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:59,648
I'm sorry, Jude.

532
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:13,613
<i>It was no surprise</i>

533
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:17,788
<i>when the Ottoman Empire joined the fight</i>
<i>on the side of Germany.</i>

534
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:25,382
<i>Or when Russia declared war on the empire</i>

535
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,093
<i>and began a massive invasion from the east.</i>

536
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:34,596
<i>Our village, Van, was directly</i>
<i>in the path of the Russian army.</i>

537
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,812
<i>For some of the local Armenians,</i>

538
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,648
<i>the Russians were their gateway</i>
<i>to liberation.</i>

539
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:49,573
<i>The Ottomans took measures</i>
<i>to stamp out the Armenian rebels.</i>

540
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:52,284
<i>And the rebels fought back.</i>

541
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:56,410
Armenian rebels have taken over
the centre of the city

542
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:57,907
and they plan to hold it

543
01:03:58,043 --> 01:04:00,877
until Russian troops
can cross the border and join them.

544
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:06,625
So, your orders are to penetrate their
defences and assess their strength.

545
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,218
And, Colonel Khalil,
how will we know the difference

546
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:12,009
between the rebels and the ordinary citizens?

547
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:14,723
The rebels will be the ones
trying to kill you.

548
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:53,380
Come on. Go, go!

549
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:54,926
Go, go.

550
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:11,279
Come on!

551
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:21,818
And who is this?

552
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:23,565
This is a patient.

553
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:27,990
More specific. Turkish? Armenian?

554
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:32,495
A patient recovering
from blunt trauma to his left leg.

555
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,163
Dr Woodruff.

556
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:38,585
I insist the use of these beds
be turned over to the Ottoman army.

557
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:45,050
The flag over this mission
is American, not Ottoman.

558
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:49,300
By international protocol, we have
the right to administer as we see fit.

559
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:53,224
I built this hospital to help
those who most need our help.

560
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:57,851
So, when any of your boys are carried here

561
01:09:57,985 --> 01:10:03,777
with a leg missing
or their entrails cupped in their hands,

562
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,570
we will take care of them.

563
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:11,288
Search the entire hospital,
top to bottom. See what they're hiding.

564
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:15,126
- You have no authority to do this.
- It is wartime, Doctor.

565
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:17,119
I have every authority.

566
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:23,592
Let's go in here.

567
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:33,390
This is an outrage.
You cannot just walk in here.

568
01:10:33,521 --> 01:10:36,264
Lieutenant, this is a sanctified chapel.

569
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,687
Please.

570
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:42,902
There's nothing to interest you in here.

571
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,411
Please.

572
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:55,745
Stop.

573
01:10:57,462 --> 01:10:59,249
Go and search the stables.

574
01:11:13,728 --> 01:11:15,185
Thank you.

575
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,857
Lillie.

576
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:23,777
I have to see you.

577
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:38,667
My government will hear about this.

578
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:42,505
The Russians are burning a path
from the east and they'll be here soon.

579
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:46,672
Let's see how you fare with them,
Dr Woodruff. They're savages.

580
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:49,546
You Americans and Europeans,

581
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:55,597
whether you come here to help
or to fight or to make a profit,

582
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:57,720
you'll never be anything but insignificant.

583
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:01,022
We don't pretend to be anything else.

584
01:12:01,776 --> 01:12:04,564
When your countries
were still swamp and forests,

585
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:08,405
culture had already lit up our lands
for thousands of years.

586
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:10,991
And when you're nothing but history,

587
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:15,909
collapsed into darkness
like Rome, like Greece,

588
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,748
we'll still be here.

589
01:12:55,997 --> 01:12:58,580
- Hello.
- Hello.

590
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:04,832
Lillie, I don't how much time we have.
I have to go on a mission soon.

591
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,490
Are you sure?

592
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:14,548
You've been waiting for me?

593
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:19,171
Yeah.

594
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:21,389
Lillie.

595
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:24,263
Lillie.

596
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:34,145
You were with him.

597
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:49,201
Oh, Lillie?

598
01:15:52,048 --> 01:15:53,255
Yes?

599
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:05,426
I'm so sorry.

600
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:09,664
<i>The Russian invasion was upon us.</i>

601
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:15,420
<i>Some Armenian rebels joined the Russian</i>
<i>forces to fight the Ottoman army</i>

602
01:17:15,548 --> 01:17:17,210
<i>and all hell was breaking loose.</i>

603
01:17:18,259 --> 01:17:21,593
<i>Near us, Armenian men</i>
<i>were taken from their homes</i>

604
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,508
<i>and conscripted to serve in the Ottoman army,</i>

605
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:29,886
<i>while the rounding-up of Armenian women,</i>
<i>children and the elderly had begun.</i>

606
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:35,107
<i>Ismail was sent on</i>
<i>what seemed like a suicide mission</i>

607
01:17:35,234 --> 01:17:39,353
<i>to destroy weapons in an armoury</i>
<i>that the Russians had captured</i>

608
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,730
<i>and were heavily guarding.</i>

609
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:44,904
I am your guide.

610
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:48,783
You? Where are all the others?

611
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:53,249
The others were cowards.
They fled when the Russians came.

612
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:56,415
- What's your name?
- My name is Ahmet, Lieutenant.

613
01:17:57,798 --> 01:17:59,039
All right, Ahmet.

614
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:02,171
When did the Russians take the armoury?

615
01:18:02,303 --> 01:18:03,919
Three days ago, Lieutenant.

616
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:06,262
I need to know where the munitions are kept.

617
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:55,016
That's the door where they keep the guns.

618
01:18:57,191 --> 01:19:00,980
- Go back.
- I want to help you.

619
01:19:02,196 --> 01:19:05,655
You're too young. Wait with the horses.

620
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:48,466
- Go!
- Where?

621
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:49,926
I have nowhere to go.

622
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:51,795
You go to the mission hospital

623
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:54,638
and tell the American nurse
Lieutenant Veli sent you.

624
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:56,633
Go!

625
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:45,287
You can take her in here
to the back, please. Thank you.

626
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:49,083
Lillie, the Turks have abandoned
the garrison and they left the city.

627
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:50,546
Russian soldiers are coming.

628
01:23:15,032 --> 01:23:16,773
But you didn't see him?

629
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:18,320
You didn't see him die?

630
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:22,153
I have to find him.

631
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,282
- You can't go. You'll be killed.
- I have to find him.

632
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:29,161
Lillie, you're going out there
to find a dead man.

633
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:31,963
He's not dead.

634
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:48,520
Take this.

635
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:52,983
Thank you, Dr Woodruff.

636
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:55,061
I hope you won't need it.

637
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:00,741
God bless you.

638
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:44,695
<i>I see it more every day.</i>

639
01:24:46,873 --> 01:24:48,990
<i>Villages torn apart.</i>

640
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:52,585
<i>How this war is destroying lives.</i>

641
01:24:52,713 --> 01:24:55,330
<i>Brothers fighting each other.</i>

642
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:57,673
<i>Villagers fleeing their homes,</i>

643
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:00,005
<i>not knowing where to go.</i>

644
01:25:02,139 --> 01:25:05,052
<i>Everyone just running away from the war.</i>

645
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:10,223
<i>Bound only by a common pain.</i>

646
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:02,856
Lillie.

647
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:05,992
Lillie.

648
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:11,664
Lillie.

649
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:21,082
Ismail!

650
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:25,420
I...

651
01:26:25,555 --> 01:26:28,889
Here. Have some water.

652
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:40,894
Mm... Thank you.

653
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:47,033
- I'm gonna take care of you.
- I'm all right. I'm all right.

654
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:54,307
Wait.

655
01:27:54,728 --> 01:27:56,014
- Stop!
- What is it?

656
01:27:56,146 --> 01:27:57,387
Stop the car!

657
01:28:03,069 --> 01:28:06,153
- Oh, God.
- Get us down there.

658
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:28,546
Who's in charge here?

659
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:32,221
Huh?

660
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:34,557
I am.

661
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:41,935
I'm your superior. Salute me!

662
01:28:45,487 --> 01:28:47,729
- What are you doing?
- They're just Armenians.

663
01:28:49,866 --> 01:28:53,485
I'm Lieutenant Ismail Veli,
and these people are coming with me.

664
01:28:57,207 --> 01:28:58,368
For what reason?

665
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:02,039
By order of Colonel Khalil,
for interrogation purposes.

666
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:05,872
- Children, too?
- Yes. All of them.

667
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:08,332
- I'll take full responsibility.
- No.

668
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:10,626
- What?
- No.

669
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:12,469
They're ours.

670
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:15,135
This is not a request.

671
01:29:15,267 --> 01:29:18,226
I'm ordering you to release these people.

672
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:29,525
Release them!

673
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:37,786
Go.

674
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:47,004
Come on. Go, go!

675
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:50,041
Go!

676
01:29:53,847 --> 01:29:54,883
Go!

677
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:58,053
Lillie! Lillie!

678
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:01,681
- Lillie!
- Sh! Sh! Sh!

679
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:04,597
Take her. Go!

680
01:30:05,692 --> 01:30:07,479
- Get in the truck!
- Wait, Lieutenant!

681
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:11,187
When did Colonel Khalil issue this order?

682
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:13,565
Early this morning.

683
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:16,317
Colonel Khalil was killed last night.

684
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:23,540
Don't try to stop us.

685
01:30:36,306 --> 01:30:37,422
Go!

686
01:30:58,244 --> 01:30:59,280
It's all right.

687
01:31:12,968 --> 01:31:14,004
Oh...

688
01:31:14,177 --> 01:31:16,419
It's all right. It's all right.

689
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:34,319
There are two bullets. Internal damage.

690
01:31:35,365 --> 01:31:37,857
You realise the position you put us in
by bringing him here?

691
01:31:37,993 --> 01:31:40,360
- You won't deny him help.
- I told you.

692
01:31:41,955 --> 01:31:43,617
This hospital turns no one away.

693
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:05,141
Gauze.

694
01:32:05,687 --> 01:32:07,428
Russians! The Russians!

695
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:19,614
- Out.
- Gauze.

696
01:32:24,706 --> 01:32:25,742
Gauze.

697
01:32:32,756 --> 01:32:33,792
This is a hospital!

698
01:32:35,425 --> 01:32:37,712
This is a hospital!

699
01:32:37,844 --> 01:32:39,756
If you have wounded, they are welcome!

700
01:32:43,516 --> 01:32:45,098
We will care for your wounded.

701
01:32:48,897 --> 01:32:51,105
But your men with their weapons must leave.

702
01:33:14,297 --> 01:33:16,835
- What are you doing, Ismail?
- No, no, don't come.

703
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:19,709
If the Russians find me,
they'll kill all of you.

704
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:22,462
My army is on the other side of the lake.

705
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:25,055
If I just get there...

706
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:38,060
All right. All right.

707
01:34:06,266 --> 01:34:07,928
Cossacks.

708
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:21,831
Stop.

709
01:35:25,136 --> 01:35:28,049
- Stop rowing.
- No.

710
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:34,014
Look, Ismail. Can't you see?

711
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:36,262
We're almost there where you'll be safe.

712
01:35:36,856 --> 01:35:40,395
Stop. Stop rowing.

713
01:35:40,526 --> 01:35:42,267
But we're so close.

714
01:35:53,790 --> 01:35:55,452
We're so close.

715
01:35:58,419 --> 01:36:00,285
Please, just be with me.

716
01:36:11,891 --> 01:36:14,008
I'm here. I'm here.

717
01:36:18,273 --> 01:36:19,309
I'm here with you.

718
01:36:21,192 --> 01:36:24,105
I'm here with you. I'm here with you.

719
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:28,898
I'm with you.

720
01:36:39,252 --> 01:36:41,835
Look, Ismail.

721
01:36:49,095 --> 01:36:51,178
Inside God's thoughts.

722
01:36:53,433 --> 01:36:55,049
Yes.

723
01:36:56,561 --> 01:36:58,223
I remember.

724
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:04,600
And I'll never forget.

725
01:37:11,075 --> 01:37:12,532
Lillie...

726
01:37:14,287 --> 01:37:15,323
Don't be afraid.

727
01:37:17,874 --> 01:37:19,331
Don't be afraid.

728
01:37:35,641 --> 01:37:37,098
Ismail?

729
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:44,686
Ismail...

730
01:42:35,441 --> 01:42:38,184
<i>When I first came here, I had a mission.</i>

731
01:42:41,197 --> 01:42:43,154
<i>I wanted to make a difference.</i>

732
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:47,693
<i>It took so much from me.</i>

733
01:42:51,707 --> 01:42:54,825
<i>I don't know if I will ever</i>
<i>stop thinking about him.</i>

734
01:42:58,297 --> 01:43:03,167
<i>But now I understand more than ever</i>
<i>why I need to go on.</i>

735
01:43:07,306 --> 01:43:09,013
<i>I am one of them now.</i>

736
01:43:12,353 --> 01:43:17,473
<i>And, like them, I still believe</i>
<i>in a God that is good and just.</i>

737
01:43:20,528 --> 01:43:24,568
<i>And I know that peace will return one day.</i>
