00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:27,911
100 years ago, a deceptively
simple formula was written.

2
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:32,258
It held the key to how our world began
and why it works as it does.

3
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,014
It led to the creation
of the atom bomb

4
00:00:39,115 --> 00:00:42,515
and it uncovered the
darkest secrets of the universe.

5
00:00:45,404 --> 00:00:48,551
Its author was a youthful Albert Einstein.

6
00:00:50,698 --> 00:00:55,206
It's one of the most important and certainly
the most famous equation in the world.

7
00:00:56,306 --> 00:01:02,130
E equals mc squared.

8
00:01:07,696 --> 00:01:09,750
All aboard.

9
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,762
When we think of E = mc2
we have this vision of Einstein

10
00:01:16,863 --> 00:01:18,963
as an old wrinkly man with white hair.

11
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:25,000
E = mc2 is not about an old Einstein.

12
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:31,800
It's actually about a young, energetic,
dynamic, even a sexy Einstein.

13
00:01:34,538 --> 00:01:37,062
But while we've all heard
of young Einstein's equation

14
00:01:37,938 --> 00:01:39,684
very few of us know what it means.

15
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:46,738
In fact, E=mc2 is so remarkable that

16
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:49,739
even Einstein wasn't sure
if it was really true.

17
00:01:55,604 --> 00:01:58,960
Albert, darling, you're later
then I expected tonight.

18
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:05,568
We've only got sausage and
cheese tonight. Which is it?

19
00:02:06,202 --> 00:02:07,518
We need to talk!

20
00:02:07,786 --> 00:02:09,064
Has something happened?

21
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:11,892
Oh, no, nothing, sorry. No.

22
00:02:12,627 --> 00:02:16,703
I spend most of the day staring at
the window at work looking at trains.

23
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:23,130
And I started to think about an object
and how much energy it had.

24
00:02:23,816 --> 00:02:28,187
- Can I explain it to you?
- Of course you can. But first, dinner!

25
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,883
Food, then talk.

26
00:02:34,065 --> 00:02:37,050
I think the gods are laughing at me.

27
00:02:37,096 --> 00:02:41,348
But the gods were not laughing at Einstein.

28
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:46,403
What he'd done has combined
in one stunning insight,

29
00:02:46,504 --> 00:02:49,404
the work of many great visionaries.

30
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:55,796
This is the story of Einstein and all
the scientists who went before.

31
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,001
Who'd fought and even died to create
each part of the equation.

32
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,532
It's a tale of ambition, betrayal,
heartache and deceit.

33
00:03:17,956 --> 00:03:23,648
And the story of E=mc2 starts long before
the birth of its creator, Einstein,

34
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,935
with the discovery of E, for energy.

35
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:44,438
In the early 19th century,
scientists didn't think in terms of energy.

36
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:49,582
They thought in terms of
individual powers or forces.

37
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:52,566
These were all disconnected,
unrelated things:

38
00:03:53,513 --> 00:03:57,917
the power of the wind,
the force of a door closing,

39
00:03:57,998 --> 00:03:59,918
the crack of lightning.

40
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:05,179
The idea that there might be some sort of
overarching, unifying energy

41
00:04:05,752 --> 00:04:08,771
which lay behind all these forces
had yet to be revealed.

42
00:04:10,694 --> 00:04:15,090
One poor, hungry man's drive
to understand the hidden

43
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:18,091
mysteries of nature
would begin to change all that.

44
00:04:23,715 --> 00:04:25,463
Young Michael Faraday hated his job.

45
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:29,226
He was uneducated;
the son of a blacksmith,

46
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:32,227
he'd been lucky to become
a bookbinder's apprentice.

47
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:36,051
But Faraday craved one thing,
he craved knowledge.

48
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,916
He read every book that passed
through his hands.

49
00:04:38,383 --> 00:04:39,874
He developed a passion for science.

50
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,250
All of his free time and his meager wages
were poured into his self-education.

51
00:04:45,926 --> 00:04:49,843
He was on the threshold of an incredible
journey into the invisible world of energy.

52
00:05:04,797 --> 00:05:07,337
Faraday had impressed one
of his master's customers

53
00:05:07,438 --> 00:05:11,338
and was rewarded with a ticket
that would change his life.

54
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:14,103
Can I pass, please?

55
00:05:15,637 --> 00:05:17,351
Can I pass?

56
00:05:18,546 --> 00:05:21,038
Some of us are trying to improve ourselves,
if people will let us.

57
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:25,540
Of course, of course. Pass, pass.
This way to a better life.

58
00:05:27,962 --> 00:05:31,022
In the early 1800s, science was
the pursuit of gentlemen

59
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:33,693
something Faraday was clearly not.

60
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:36,565
He had a rudimentary education,

61
00:05:37,353 --> 00:05:38,565
he'd read widely

62
00:05:38,993 --> 00:05:42,139
he'd gone to public lectures, but in 1812,

63
00:05:42,448 --> 00:05:45,063
he was given tickets to hear
Sir Humphry Davy,

64
00:05:46,058 --> 00:05:48,034
the most prominent chemist of the age.

65
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:59,348
Nineteenth century scientists were
the pop stars of their day.

66
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:02,626
Their lectures were hugely popular,

67
00:06:03,718 --> 00:06:05,096
tickets were hard to come by,

68
00:06:06,014 --> 00:06:08,544
and Davy reveled in his status.

69
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:11,595
- They're waiting.
- I know.

70
00:06:13,642 --> 00:06:17,071
He was also a
keen follower of the latest fashion:

71
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:20,072
nitrous oxide, or "laughing gas".

72
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,445
He said it had all the benefits of alcohol
without the hangover.

73
00:06:28,392 --> 00:06:30,354
Electricity, ladies and gentlemen,

74
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:34,050
a mysterious force that
can unravel the confusing mixture

75
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,969
of intermingled substances
that surround us and produce pure,

76
00:06:39,437 --> 00:06:41,060
pure elements. How do we do this?

77
00:06:41,204 --> 00:06:42,958
Davy was an absolutely first-rate scientist

78
00:06:43,506 --> 00:06:47,871
however, many will come to say that
his greatest discovery is Michael Faraday.

79
00:06:48,254 --> 00:06:49,873
...unknown metals.
Unknown that is until I,

80
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:53,437
I isolated potassium from
molten potash and sodium,

81
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,884
as I showed you last time,
from common salt.

82
00:06:56,287 --> 00:06:57,755
That same metal...

83
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:01,712
Faraday may not have
been born a gentleman,

84
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:06,007
but he wasn't going to let class barriers
stop him from pursuing a career in science.

85
00:07:08,514 --> 00:07:13,284
He worked for nights on end to bind his
lecture notes into a book for his new hero.

86
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:19,473
Lord, help me to think only of others,

87
00:07:20,156 --> 00:07:22,889
to be of use to mankind.

88
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:28,398
Help me be part of the Great Circle
that is your work and love.

89
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:32,270
Lord, I am your servant.

90
00:07:39,271 --> 00:07:40,889
This is excellent work, Faraday.

91
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,958
So, what is it you aim
to do with your life?

92
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:49,616
My desire, sir, is to escape from trade

93
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:51,736
which I find vicious and selfish

94
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:53,720
and to become a
servant of science,

95
00:07:54,084 --> 00:07:59,295
which I imagine makes its pursuers
amiable and liberal.

96
00:08:02,185 --> 00:08:05,236
Really? Well, I shall leave it to
the experience of a few years

97
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:07,011
to set you right on that score.

98
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:09,707
Look, I haven't anything at the moment.

99
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:11,609
I'll send a note if anything comes up.

100
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:19,913
Despite this humiliating setback,

101
00:08:20,444 --> 00:08:23,568
Faraday was determined
to break free from his daily toil.

102
00:08:25,894 --> 00:08:28,774
His patience was rewarded.

103
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:53,731
Newman, meet Mr. Michael Faraday,
he's going to be my helper while I recover.

104
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,232
He assures me he is
a Christian fellow.

105
00:08:58,011 --> 00:08:59,781
Perhaps with God and Faraday
in charge of the chemicals

106
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,044
you and I will be safe in our place of work.

107
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:04,787
Thank you, Professor Davy.
Welcome Faraday.

108
00:09:05,352 --> 00:09:08,034
Oh, no, thank you.
And thank you, Sir Humphry.

109
00:09:08,124 --> 00:09:11,793
Just stick to your job and do as you're
told, and you'll be fine, Faraday.

110
00:09:18,514 --> 00:09:20,479
Faraday became the laboratory assistant,

111
00:09:20,905 --> 00:09:25,425
eagerly absorbing every scrap of
knowledge that Davy deigned to impart.

112
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:29,495
But in time the pupil would
surpass the master.

113
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:38,658
The big excitement of
the day was electricity.

114
00:09:39,134 --> 00:09:40,563
Another charge, Newman.

115
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,296
The battery had just been invented

116
00:09:44,426 --> 00:09:48,136
and all manner of experiments
were being performed.

117
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:52,600
But no one really understood what
this strange force of electricity was.

118
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,052
The academic establishment, at the time,
thought that electricity was

119
00:09:59,663 --> 00:10:03,821
you know, like a fluid flowing through
a pipe, pushing its way along.

120
00:10:04,005 --> 00:10:07,885
But, in 1821, a Danish researcher showed
that when you pass an electric current

121
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,977
through a wire and place a compass near it,

122
00:10:11,516 --> 00:10:13,792
it deflected the needle at right angles.

123
00:10:15,526 --> 00:10:19,610
This was the first time researchers
had seen electricity affect a magnet:

124
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:21,784
the first glimpse of two forces,

125
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,319
which had previously been seen
as entirely separate,

126
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,566
now unified in some inexplicable way.

127
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,474
Faraday, come look at this.
You're the bright spark around here,

128
00:10:30,475 --> 00:10:31,475
perhaps you can work it out.

129
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:33,896
Oersted's reported an amazing finding.

130
00:10:34,436 --> 00:10:36,248
We're just replicating it here.

131
00:10:36,843 --> 00:10:38,519
Let's try the compass
on the other side.

132
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,191
Now, that is remarkable.

133
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,572
But if the electrical force
is flowing through the wire,

134
00:10:47,943 --> 00:10:50,777
why does the needle not move in
the same direction, parallel to the wire?

135
00:10:51,537 --> 00:10:52,799
Quite.

136
00:10:53,221 --> 00:10:55,929
Let's try turning the whole apparatus round.

137
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:01,735
Again, Newman.

138
00:11:05,034 --> 00:11:08,605
So, the electrical force goes this way,

139
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:11,724
the compass points that way.

140
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:15,068
How can one affect the other?

141
00:11:17,526 --> 00:11:22,187
Perhaps the electricity is throwing out
some invisible force as it moves along?

142
00:11:22,308 --> 00:11:23,068
What?

143
00:11:23,588 --> 00:11:28,812
Perhaps some sort of electrical force
is emanating outwards from the wire.

144
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,164
Oh, my dear boy, let me tell you that
at the University of Cambridge,

145
00:11:32,607 --> 00:11:35,962
electricity flows through a wire,
not sideways to it.

146
00:11:36,186 --> 00:11:38,003
Well, that may be what they teach
at Cambridge, but it doesn't explain

147
00:11:38,104 --> 00:11:39,604
what's happening before our eyes.

148
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:43,569
Now, now. Let's just get on. Let's swap
the compass to below the wire.

149
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:47,593
Why the compass was deflected
at right angles,

150
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,383
why the electricity was affecting
the compass at all,

151
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,774
dumbfounded Davy and many others.

152
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,633
As we celebrate the marriage
of Michael and Sarah...

153
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,123
For Faraday, however,
the problem became an obsession.

154
00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:06,697
It was a fascination
inspired by his religion.

155
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:10,570
For him this was a way
to understand God's hidden mysteries.

156
00:12:14,356 --> 00:12:17,081
There is a small, almost persecuted group
in London called the Sandemanians.

157
00:12:17,755 --> 00:12:19,465
They were religious...
not really a sect,

158
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:21,535
they were just a small sub-sect,
sort of like Quakers.

159
00:12:21,883 --> 00:12:24,917
Faraday was a member of that group.
It was a very gentle, decent group.

160
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:27,575
They believed that underneath
the whole surface of reality,

161
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,206
everything was created
by God in a unified way

162
00:12:30,554 --> 00:12:32,588
that if you opened up one little part of it

163
00:12:32,689 --> 00:12:34,389
you could see
how everything was connected.

164
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:41,354
Michael Faraday was someone who,
like Einstein,

165
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:43,398
thought in terms of pictures.

166
00:12:45,801 --> 00:12:48,379
Faraday was different from anybody else.

167
00:12:48,664 --> 00:12:50,556
He had a flair for understanding
his experiments,

168
00:12:50,976 --> 00:12:53,364
for understanding what was
really going on inside them.

169
00:12:56,918 --> 00:13:00,594
By methodically placing a compass
all around an electrified wire,

170
00:13:00,825 --> 00:13:03,456
Faraday started to notice a pattern.

171
00:13:09,494 --> 00:13:11,374
What everyone else at
the time had been taught

172
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:12,875
was that forces
travel in straight lines.

173
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:14,937
Faraday was different.

174
00:13:15,205 --> 00:13:17,264
Faraday imagined that
invisible lines of force

175
00:13:17,685 --> 00:13:18,984
flowed around an electric wire.

176
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:23,498
And then he imagined that a magnet
had similar lines emerging from it

177
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:26,593
and that those lines would
get caught up in this flow.

178
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,105
It was a bit like a flag in a wind.

179
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:35,401
But Faraday's great leap
of the imagination

180
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:37,702
was to turn this experiment on its head.

181
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:41,822
Instead of an electrified
wire moving a compass,

182
00:13:42,211 --> 00:13:45,773
he wondered if he could get a static
magnet to move a dangling wire.

183
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:48,405
I've never seen you like this, Faraday.

184
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:51,315
You look like a happy child.

185
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:52,852
I'm shaking, Newman.

186
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,819
Underneath I'm shaking.

187
00:14:04,317 --> 00:14:07,266
You see, John, you see?

188
00:14:07,398 --> 00:14:09,073
Yes.

189
00:14:19,045 --> 00:14:21,359
This is the experiment of the century.

190
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,573
It's the invention of the electric motor.

191
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:28,770
Scale up the magnets and the wires;
make them really big.

192
00:14:29,496 --> 00:14:33,380
Attach heavy weights to them
and they'll be dragged along.

193
00:14:34,368 --> 00:14:35,645
But almost more importantly,

194
00:14:36,312 --> 00:14:38,593
he's inventing a new kind of physics here.

195
00:14:39,736 --> 00:14:41,832
Although he didn't realize it at the time,

196
00:14:42,436 --> 00:14:46,492
Faraday had also just demonstrated
the overarching principle of energy.

197
00:14:47,675 --> 00:14:52,558
The chemicals in the battery had been
transformed into electricity in the wire,

198
00:14:53,081 --> 00:14:56,499
which had combined with
the magnet to produce motion

199
00:14:57,713 --> 00:15:01,725
Behind all these various forces
there was a common energy.

200
00:15:13,218 --> 00:15:14,726
A couple of months earlier,

201
00:15:15,074 --> 00:15:17,293
Davy had been elected
President of the Royal Society,

202
00:15:17,755 --> 00:15:19,589
which was the elite body of English science.

203
00:15:21,081 --> 00:15:23,331
But then he saw this great
discovery published in

204
00:15:23,332 --> 00:15:24,332
the Quarterly
Journal of Science.

205
00:15:24,911 --> 00:15:26,074
I don't know if he was envious,

206
00:15:26,456 --> 00:15:28,796
but he certainly saw that this young man
who had been his assistant,

207
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:30,690
this mere blacksmith's son,

208
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,856
had come up with one of the greatest
discoveries of the Victorian era.

209
00:15:40,197 --> 00:15:44,883
Davy accuses Faraday of
plagiarizing similar work

210
00:15:45,287 --> 00:15:48,806
from another eminent British scientist,
William Wollaston.

211
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:53,185
So Faraday, what does
Wollaston make of all this?

212
00:15:53,224 --> 00:15:56,164
He's written to me and assures me
that he's taken no offense,

213
00:15:56,669 --> 00:16:00,274
and he acknowledges that what
I published was entirely my own work.

214
00:16:00,313 --> 00:16:03,406
Quite, quite.
Davy is just being an ass.

215
00:16:03,851 --> 00:16:05,597
But will Davy now retract his allegation?

216
00:16:05,938 --> 00:16:08,452
Sadly, no. In fact,
he is still vehemently opposed

217
00:16:08,744 --> 00:16:10,756
to you being elected
a member of the Society.

218
00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:12,994
Really? And what do you think?

219
00:16:13,383 --> 00:16:15,835
- Faraday, my dear boy, you have my vote.
- And mine.

220
00:16:16,202 --> 00:16:21,420
- And I believe you even have Wollaston's.
- Oh, what a mess.

221
00:16:21,475 --> 00:16:24,366
Well, no matter, no matter.
It's the science that counts.

222
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,897
So, tell me, how does this wire of yours
spin round its magnet?

223
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,026
What mysterious forces are at play?

224
00:16:31,768 --> 00:16:35,531
There seems to be
an electro-magnetic interaction.

225
00:16:36,758 --> 00:16:39,832
In my mind, I see a swirling
array of lines of force

226
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:44,865
spinning out of the electrified wire,
like a spiraling web.

227
00:16:45,876 --> 00:16:49,055
But invisible lines of force?
It's all a bit vague, isn't it?

228
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,614
Faraday, might I have a word in private?

229
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:55,063
Certainly.

230
00:17:06,282 --> 00:17:08,362
Listen, Faraday,
let's stop this nonsense.

231
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:11,272
I want you to take down your
ballot paper from the notice board.

232
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:15,356
Sir Humphry,
I see no reason to take it down.

233
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:19,484
My friends have proposed me.
It is they who put the paper up.

234
00:17:19,903 --> 00:17:22,035
I will not take it down.
Good day.

235
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:29,130
Faraday was elected
to the Royal Society.

236
00:17:29,662 --> 00:17:34,321
Davy died five years later,
a victim of his puncheon for laughing gas.

237
00:17:35,877 --> 00:17:39,912
In time, Faraday's world
of invisible forces would lead

238
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:41,999
to a whole new understanding of energy.

239
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:48,405
He'd started what Einstein would like
to call "The Great Revolution".

240
00:18:04,486 --> 00:18:09,206
Albert Einstein grew up in an industrial
society obsessed with energy.

241
00:18:18,037 --> 00:18:20,640
All the forces of nature had been unified

242
00:18:20,741 --> 00:18:24,041
and man taught he was the master
of this new power.

243
00:18:25,141 --> 00:18:28,848
Young Einstein was going to pull
this cosy world view apart.

244
00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:32,072
My father and uncle wanted
to make their fortune

245
00:18:32,173 --> 00:18:35,173
by bringing electric light
to the streets of Germany.

246
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:40,193
From an early age I loved
to look at machines,

247
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,570
understand how things work.

248
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:49,450
He's going to kill himself.

249
00:18:50,522 --> 00:18:52,345
Albert, stay there.

250
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:06,143
I experienced a miracle when
my father showed me a compass.

251
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:10,062
I trembled and grew cold.

252
00:19:12,057 --> 00:19:16,197
There had to be something
behind objects that lay deeply hidden.

253
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,310
At high school, they had their ideas
about what I should learn,

254
00:19:25,692 --> 00:19:29,993
I had my own. I was merely
interested in physics, maths,

255
00:19:30,476 --> 00:19:34,534
philosophy and playing the violin.
Everything else was a bore.

256
00:19:34,895 --> 00:19:37,900
Einstein, on your feet.

257
00:19:41,174 --> 00:19:45,168
As you obviously know everything
about geology, tell me

258
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:49,760
how do the rock strata run here?

259
00:19:50,808 --> 00:19:55,004
It's pretty much the same to me
whichever way they run, Herr Professor.

260
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:05,992
Einstein's teachers tried to drum into him,
as Faraday had shown,

261
00:20:06,427 --> 00:20:10,038
that energy could be converted
from one form into another.

262
00:20:10,762 --> 00:20:13,894
They also believed that all forms of
energy had already been discovered.

263
00:20:14,802 --> 00:20:16,493
Einstein was going to prove them wrong.

264
00:20:17,602 --> 00:20:20,524
He would discover a new,
vast reservoir of energy,

265
00:20:20,937 --> 00:20:23,636
hidden where no other scientist
had ever thought of looking,

266
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,234
deep in the heart of matter.

267
00:20:40,074 --> 00:20:42,293
A hundred years before Einstein's birth,

268
00:20:42,738 --> 00:20:46,397
King Louis the XV was on the throne
of France, but the ancient,

269
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:51,052
absolute power of the monarchy over
the people was starting to be challenged.

270
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,020
Jacques, leave the windows,
forget the rain, we need air.

271
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:59,750
The French Revolution was
just around the corner.

272
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:06,239
This was the era of the Enlightenment,

273
00:21:06,595 --> 00:21:10,886
when intellectuals believed very firmly
that the way forward lay in science.

274
00:21:11,513 --> 00:21:14,333
And they felt that one of the first
tasks that lay ahead of them

275
00:21:14,705 --> 00:21:17,990
was to rationalize and to classify
every single kind of matter

276
00:21:18,352 --> 00:21:20,693
so they could see how it
all interacted together.

277
00:21:22,135 --> 00:21:25,115
Antoine Lavoisier, a wealthy,
aristocratic young man

278
00:21:25,726 --> 00:21:29,545
decided to take up this task to see
if there was some basic connection

279
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:34,775
between all the stuff of everyday life,
all the different substances in the world.

280
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:44,454
But what worked for Lavoisier
as a scientist,his meticulous,

281
00:21:44,818 --> 00:21:49,629
even obsessive attention to detail,
was also to be his downfall.

282
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:55,456
Monsieur Lavoisier, you are,
if my eyes do not deceive me,

283
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:57,600
consuming only milk this evening.

284
00:21:57,907 --> 00:22:01,630
First you had a glass of milk,
now you are "eating" a bowl of milk.

285
00:22:02,138 --> 00:22:05,221
Will you move on to a plate of milk?

286
00:22:06,636 --> 00:22:10,036
Your precise observations commend you
as a lady of scientific curiosity,

287
00:22:10,576 --> 00:22:12,633
Mademoiselle, most unusual.

288
00:22:13,063 --> 00:22:14,633
As you seek knowledge,
so I shall dispense it.

289
00:22:15,118 --> 00:22:19,937
For the last five weeks
I have taken nothing but milk.

290
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:25,991
Good god, man, I would rather die
than fast on milk for five weeks.

291
00:22:26,068 --> 00:22:28,784
Are you in the grip of
some horrendous ailment?

292
00:22:29,193 --> 00:22:34,643
On the contrary. I am investigating
the effects of diet on health.

293
00:22:35,911 --> 00:22:39,715
Monsieur, with the greatest of respect to
a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences,

294
00:22:40,142 --> 00:22:43,122
your gut must think
your throat has been slit.

295
00:22:50,856 --> 00:22:53,391
Whereas your gut,
Count, is, no doubt,

296
00:22:53,492 --> 00:22:56,192
petitioning the Academy for
a widening of your throat.

297
00:22:56,275 --> 00:23:00,622
Marie Anne, how dare you insult the Count?

298
00:23:02,954 --> 00:23:05,342
Don't forget what the Count offers.

299
00:23:05,946 --> 00:23:11,180
Not just marriage, but think of how you
will be introduced to all the Salons.

300
00:23:13,816 --> 00:23:16,515
You will be the toast of Paris.

301
00:23:18,996 --> 00:23:23,153
Would it not be a shame, Madame,
to burden you with the duties of matrimony

302
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:27,734
before you have had a chance
to experience your curiosity for nature?

303
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:35,556
Shall we all go through?
It's getting rather hot in here.

304
00:23:43,732 --> 00:23:45,264
Do you really plan to marry de Amerval?

305
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:49,926
- There is a plan, but it is not mine.
- Then I must contrive to save you.

306
00:23:54,936 --> 00:23:57,313
Lavoisier wasn't a scientist by profession.

307
00:23:58,026 --> 00:24:00,404
He was the head of tax enforcement in Paris.

308
00:24:01,646 --> 00:24:04,096
His great idea was to build
a huge wall around the city

309
00:24:04,197 --> 00:24:06,997
and to tax everything
that came and went.

310
00:24:08,507 --> 00:24:12,966
But his taxes on the simple things
in life-bread, wine and cheese

311
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,653
did not endear him to
the average Parisian.

312
00:24:16,085 --> 00:24:20,459
However, this scrupulous,
fastidious young man

313
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,460
did still allow himself
the occasional act of passion.

314
00:24:28,295 --> 00:24:32,402
In 1771, Lavoisier married
Marie Anne Paulze,

315
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,017
the daughter of his
colleague in the tax office.

316
00:24:36,901 --> 00:24:39,959
Thus he saved her, as he had promised,
from an arranged marriage

317
00:24:40,156 --> 00:24:43,295
to a count 40
years her elder.

318
00:24:48,042 --> 00:24:49,605
Allow me to show you something.

319
00:24:54,907 --> 00:24:58,672
Lavoisier, I think, found his job
as a tax collector really rather tedious,

320
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,838
and the times he looked forward
to were the evenings and the weekends

321
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,526
when he could indulge his passion
for chemical experimentation.

322
00:25:06,482 --> 00:25:10,526
And he called those times his "jours
de bonheur", his "days of happiness".

323
00:25:11,312 --> 00:25:13,050
Madame.

324
00:25:17,051 --> 00:25:23,051
What will happen if I take
a bar of copper or iron

325
00:25:24,087 --> 00:25:27,606
and leave it outside in the rain
for months on end,

326
00:25:27,607 --> 00:25:30,507
Madame Lavoisier?

327
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,275
Mmmm, Monsieur Lavoisier?

328
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,969
The metals what will become of them?

329
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:41,082
Is this a verbal examination prior
to an examination proper, sir?

330
00:25:43,117 --> 00:25:44,906
I merely seek the truth.

331
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:48,096
Then you toy with me, Monsieur,
for you know the truth.

332
00:25:48,732 --> 00:25:51,505
The copper will become covered
in a green verdigris

333
00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:58,074
and the iron will rust.
I believe the term is "calcined".

334
00:25:58,898 --> 00:26:02,979
Most impressive, my charming wife.
But let me press you further.

335
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,980
Mmmm.

336
00:26:04,714 --> 00:26:09,117
When the metal rusts,
does it get heavier or lighter?

337
00:26:09,162 --> 00:26:12,573
Why, sir, I think you mean to trap me.

338
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:13,429
Ooooohhh...

339
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,028
Then perhaps this little butterfly
should land

340
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:17,987
and allow me take a closer look.

341
00:26:18,646 --> 00:26:21,955
Every last citizen in France of sensible age

342
00:26:22,286 --> 00:26:24,354
knows that when a metal
rusts it wastes away,

343
00:26:24,718 --> 00:26:26,736
it gets lighter and eventually disappears.

344
00:26:26,825 --> 00:26:30,123
- Ah, but...
- Huh? Stop. I have not finished.

345
00:26:31,145 --> 00:26:33,979
Contain yourself, sir.
There is more.

346
00:26:35,543 --> 00:26:39,555
In a recently published pamphlet
by a brilliant young chemist,

347
00:26:40,094 --> 00:26:44,217
Antoine Lavoisier demonstrates
that the iron combines with the air.

348
00:26:44,652 --> 00:26:46,313
It, in fact, becomes heavier.

349
00:26:47,374 --> 00:26:49,378
Most impressive. I intend...

350
00:26:49,957 --> 00:26:53,800
Now whatever you intend, Monsieur,
I intend to be by your side.

351
00:26:54,442 --> 00:26:57,336
I will learn all I can about your science
and become your worthy colleague.

352
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,425
Then let me show you how the iron
combines with the air

353
00:27:01,339 --> 00:27:02,877
to form such a delicate union.

354
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,117
Tomorrow, Monsieur, tomorrow.

355
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:24,203
Marie Anne learned chemistry
at her husband's side,

356
00:27:24,806 --> 00:27:27,873
but soon sought other ways
to contribute to his work.

357
00:27:30,188 --> 00:27:34,584
She learned English so that she could
translate contemporary scientific works.

358
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:37,360
She took drawing lessons so that
she could record in forensic

359
00:27:37,725 --> 00:27:41,479
detail the minutiae of their work together.

360
00:27:43,274 --> 00:27:47,518
She ran their laboratory and was
the public face of "Lavoisier Enterprise".

361
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:51,221
She was central to the whole
research effort.

362
00:27:52,196 --> 00:27:57,566
Monsieur, that is a terrible thing to say.
You are a cheeky man.

363
00:27:58,496 --> 00:27:59,547
This way please, gentlemen.

364
00:28:10,194 --> 00:28:14,790
Messieurs, it is my great ambition
to demonstrate

365
00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:19,296
that nature is a closed system,

366
00:28:20,123 --> 00:28:24,766
that in any transformation,
no amount of matter, no mass,

367
00:28:25,507 --> 00:28:29,128
is ever lost, and none is gained.

368
00:28:30,658 --> 00:28:31,557
Over here, please.

369
00:28:36,975 --> 00:28:41,467
This precise amount of water
is heated to steam.

370
00:28:42,086 --> 00:28:45,200
This steam is brought into contact

371
00:28:45,301 --> 00:28:49,801
with a red hot iron barrel
embedded in the coals.

372
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:55,344
From this end, we cool the steam,
but, interestingly,

373
00:28:56,179 --> 00:28:59,327
we collect less water than we started with.

374
00:29:01,202 --> 00:29:04,437
So clearly we lose a
certain amount of water.

375
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,764
However, we also collect a gas,

376
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:14,924
and the weight of the iron barrel increases.

377
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:19,364
Now, when we combine these two increases,

378
00:29:19,816 --> 00:29:22,682
the new weight of the iron barrel
and the gas we have collected,

379
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:28,338
they are exactly equal to
the weight of the lost water.

380
00:29:29,925 --> 00:29:33,399
Aha! But is it atmospheric air,
Monsieur Lavoisier?

381
00:29:33,858 --> 00:29:36,936
No, no because I am measuring it,
to the very last grain,

382
00:29:37,563 --> 00:29:40,961
I can see that it is lighter
than the air around us,

383
00:29:41,298 --> 00:29:44,982
and moreover,

384
00:29:45,682 --> 00:29:49,276
it is flammable.

385
00:29:49,345 --> 00:29:51,299
Voila.

386
00:29:53,017 --> 00:29:54,957
Water is made out of hydrogen and oxygen.

387
00:29:55,353 --> 00:29:57,831
So what he had done is
get the oxygen to stick

388
00:29:57,932 --> 00:30:00,032
to the inside of a red
hot iron rifle barrel.

389
00:30:00,376 --> 00:30:01,999
He was basically just making rust,
which is oxygen iron,

390
00:30:02,063 --> 00:30:04,187
but he was making the rust really quickly.

391
00:30:04,726 --> 00:30:06,816
Now that left the hydrogen-what
he called combustible "air"

392
00:30:07,198 --> 00:30:08,757
and that was just floating around as a gas.

393
00:30:10,646 --> 00:30:12,779
No mass had been lost, it had
merely been transformed,

394
00:30:13,164 --> 00:30:16,713
and now he wanted to transform
it all back into water.

395
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,280
This is only the beginning.

396
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:25,415
In the next few months,
I hope to demonstrate that I can

397
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:29,940
recombine this combustible
air with vital air

398
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:33,493
and transform them both back into water.

399
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:38,194
I will recreate exactly
the same amount of water

400
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:41,195
that was lost here in this process.

401
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:44,481
It is my hope to complete the cycle,

402
00:30:45,005 --> 00:30:48,265
water into gas into water,

403
00:30:51,293 --> 00:30:53,046
and not a drop lost.

404
00:30:55,513 --> 00:30:58,848
For a long time, Lavoisier had suspected
that the exact amount of matter, the mass,

405
00:30:58,937 --> 00:31:01,794
involved in any transformation
was always conserved.

406
00:31:03,408 --> 00:31:05,949
But to prove this he had to perform
thousands of experiments,

407
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:09,386
and he had to do the measurements
with incredible accuracy.

408
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:13,977
That's where his great wealth
from being a tax collector came in.

409
00:31:15,381 --> 00:31:18,640
He could afford to commission
the most sensitive instruments ever built.

410
00:31:21,035 --> 00:31:23,856
He became obsessed with accuracy.

411
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:32,445
But Lavoisier's exacting methods
were also starting to anger

412
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:36,523
the growing mob of hungry,
disenchanted Parisians.

413
00:31:39,945 --> 00:31:43,924
Antoine, Antoine. Oh, wake up, Antoine.

414
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:50,761
I'm sorry. What time is it?

415
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,762
It is almost time to receive Monsieur Marat.

416
00:31:54,517 --> 00:31:56,313
The Academy asked you to assess his designs.

417
00:31:58,484 --> 00:32:00,408
He claims to have made a great discovery.

418
00:32:01,412 --> 00:32:03,865
Oh Antoine, have you forgotten?

419
00:32:05,115 --> 00:32:07,862
My god, another charletan
with an idea to peddle!

420
00:32:08,832 --> 00:32:10,422
God give me patience.

421
00:32:19,302 --> 00:32:21,094
Well, Monsieur Marat.

422
00:32:21,362 --> 00:32:25,349
Monsieur, I have invented
a device which projects

423
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:29,350
an image of the substance
of fire onto a screen.

424
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:34,284
You see, when a lantern is
shone through a flame

425
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:37,243
we see a shimmering pattern above the flame.

426
00:32:37,911 --> 00:32:42,689
My device renders the substance
of fire visible.

427
00:32:44,766 --> 00:32:46,891
Have you collected it,
this substance of fire?

428
00:32:47,414 --> 00:32:49,040
Have you trapped it and measured it?

429
00:32:49,646 --> 00:32:52,601
Well, no, but, but one can see it.

430
00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:56,511
I'm sorry, in the absence
of exact measurements,

431
00:32:56,897 --> 00:33:00,434
of precise observations,
without rigorous reasoning,

432
00:33:01,117 --> 00:33:04,586
one can only be engaging in conjecture.
So this is not science.

433
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:07,668
I am not given to conjecture, Monsieur.

434
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:13,161
No. If you will you excuse me,
I am extremely busy today

435
00:33:13,502 --> 00:33:16,209
Thank you. Thank you.

436
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,863
So that is all? Then, good day, Monsieur.

437
00:33:40,392 --> 00:33:41,979
Let me guess, Marat.

438
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,476
The King's scientific despot
has decreed that your invention

439
00:33:46,862 --> 00:33:49,338
does not conform to the version of the truth

440
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,625
as laid down by the Academy.

441
00:33:53,216 --> 00:33:56,499
Lavoisier, he talks about facts;

442
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,500
he worships the truth.

443
00:34:00,535 --> 00:34:04,331
Listen to me, my friend.
They are all the same, the Royal Academies.

444
00:34:04,933 --> 00:34:06,921
They insult the liberty of the mind.

445
00:34:08,597 --> 00:34:12,255
They think they are the sole
arbiters of genius.

446
00:34:13,404 --> 00:34:18,839
They are rotten to the core,
just like every other tentacle of the King.

447
00:34:20,938 --> 00:34:26,316
The people, it is they who will determine
right and wrong.

448
00:34:26,738 --> 00:34:30,758
Don't worry. In my next pamphlet,

449
00:34:30,799 --> 00:34:32,759
I will expose this persecutor of yours.

450
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:47,954
For years the Lavoisier's burned,
chopped, melted and boiled

451
00:34:48,272 --> 00:34:50,396
every conceivable substance.

452
00:34:50,737 --> 00:34:54,019
They'd shown that as long as one is
scrupulous about collecting all the vapors,

453
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,810
liquids and powders created
in a transformation

454
00:34:57,327 --> 00:34:59,027
then mass is not lost.

455
00:34:59,527 --> 00:35:01,042
Liquids might become gases,

456
00:35:01,454 --> 00:35:04,257
metals may rust,
wood may become ash and smoke,

457
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:07,954
but matter, the tiny atoms that make up
all substances,

458
00:35:08,741 --> 00:35:10,223
none of it is ever lost.

459
00:35:11,596 --> 00:35:13,759
The crowning glory of this opus

460
00:35:14,148 --> 00:35:16,479
was their remarkable use
of static electricity

461
00:35:16,802 --> 00:35:21,783
to cause oxygen and hydrogen
to recombine back into water.

462
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,680
What is happening?

463
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:48,613
As the French Revolution exploded,

464
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:51,412
the royal family and whole
swathes of aristocrats

465
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,875
lost their heads on the guillotine.

466
00:35:58,605 --> 00:36:00,921
To the French revolutionaries of 1790,

467
00:36:01,301 --> 00:36:03,777
Lavoisier meant one thing
and one thing only:

468
00:36:04,157 --> 00:36:07,847
he was the despised tax collector
who'd built the wall around Paris.

469
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:13,085
Lavoisier's job as a tax collector
brought him under suspicion.

470
00:36:13,691 --> 00:36:15,637
He was denounced by a failed scientist

471
00:36:15,937 --> 00:36:19,718
turned radical journalist, Jean-Paul Marat.

472
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:40,694
- Ou est Lavoisier?
- Je ne sais pas!

473
00:36:40,795 --> 00:36:42,695
Lavoisier? Lavoisier?

474
00:36:56,397 --> 00:36:58,922
Lavoisier?

475
00:37:41,697 --> 00:37:45,543
What Lavoisier did was absolutely central
to science and especially to E = mc2,

476
00:37:45,985 --> 00:37:47,852
because what he said is if you take
a bunch of matter,

477
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,908
you can break it apart, you can
recombine it, you can do anything to it,

478
00:37:50,948 --> 00:37:53,995
and the stuff of the matter
won't go away.

479
00:37:55,225 --> 00:37:56,725
If the mob burned Paris to the ground,

480
00:37:57,057 --> 00:38:00,293
utterly raised it, shattered the
bricks into rubble and dust,

481
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,244
and burned the buildings
into ashes and smoke,

482
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,930
it turns out if you put
a huge dome over Paris

483
00:38:05,271 --> 00:38:08,146
and weighed all the smoke
and all the ashes and all the rubble,

484
00:38:11,934 --> 00:38:14,529
it would add up to the exact
same weight as the original

485
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:17,130
city and the air around it before.

486
00:38:17,153 --> 00:38:18,297
Nothing disappears.

487
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:43,658
By the time Einstein enrolled
as a physics student

488
00:38:44,024 --> 00:38:45,156
the first two parts of the equation

489
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:50,427
E and m, energy and mass,
were in place.

490
00:38:52,046 --> 00:38:55,878
They were reveiled as the
two great domains of nature.

491
00:38:55,989 --> 00:39:00,781
Everything that existed fell
into one of these classifications.

492
00:39:01,896 --> 00:39:05,198
The laws that governed one,
did not apply to the other.

493
00:39:07,352 --> 00:39:10,436
But, of course, young Albert
didn't care much for laws.

494
00:39:13,538 --> 00:39:16,430
Good grief, Einstein,
what happened to you?

495
00:39:16,453 --> 00:39:18,268
It is more than a little ironic,
having been

496
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:21,608
reprimanded yesterday
by that idiot Professor Pernet

497
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:24,593
for poor attendance, that I should,
in fact, attend a practical lesson

498
00:39:24,964 --> 00:39:26,556
which was as long as it was boring,

499
00:39:27,007 --> 00:39:28,371
and utterly pointless by the way,
only to be

500
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:30,963
the victim of an explosion
of my own apparatus.

501
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:33,811
- And so it was your own fault then?
- Thank you.

502
00:39:34,608 --> 00:39:37,564
And how are you today, Fraulein Maric?

503
00:39:38,014 --> 00:39:39,419
Extremely well, Herr Einstein.

504
00:39:40,192 --> 00:39:43,282
All the better for seeing you have escaped
the physics laboratory with your life.

505
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:46,773
Well, in order not to alarm you any further,
I pledge to forever

506
00:39:46,874 --> 00:39:49,074
continue my studies here
at the Cafe Bahnhof,

507
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:52,559
reading only the great masters
of theoretical physics

508
00:39:52,956 --> 00:39:55,713
and eschewing the babbling nonsense
of the polytechnicians.

509
00:39:56,017 --> 00:39:58,188
Hah. That's about all you ever do.

510
00:39:59,081 --> 00:40:01,364
It's getting a little stuffy in here,
Fraulein Maric.

511
00:40:02,463 --> 00:40:04,112
Would you care to take a walk with me?

512
00:40:04,915 --> 00:40:07,305
There's something
I'd like to discuss with you.

513
00:40:07,811 --> 00:40:11,967
Why, Herr Einstein?... of course...

514
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:19,068
...perhaps, you'd like me to tell you what
you have missed in lectures this week?

515
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:28,993
Einstein wasn't exactly a model student.
He excelled in certain subjects,

516
00:40:29,353 --> 00:40:33,116
especially physics and math, but he wasn't
very diligent in a lot of his other classes.

517
00:40:34,657 --> 00:40:36,548
He was undoubtedly very questioning,
which seems

518
00:40:36,649 --> 00:40:39,549
to have annoyed most of
his professors throughout his life.

519
00:40:39,877 --> 00:40:42,915
He would pursue his fascinations
with just incredible determination.

520
00:40:45,618 --> 00:40:49,870
We know from his letters that Einstein,
even from the age of 16,

521
00:40:50,466 --> 00:40:53,469
was literally obsessed
with the nature of light.

522
00:40:57,945 --> 00:41:00,733
Everyone he could speak to,
his friends, his colleagues,

523
00:41:01,342 --> 00:41:03,888
even his then girlfriend, Mileva Maric,
who would become his wife

524
00:41:03,943 --> 00:41:08,356
everyone he badgered with
the question, "What is light?"

525
00:41:16,701 --> 00:41:19,777
What would I see if
I rode on a beam of light?

526
00:41:21,165 --> 00:41:22,983
What?
A beam of light?

527
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:27,368
By what method do you propose
to ride on this beam of light?

528
00:41:27,543 --> 00:41:29,035
The method is not important.

529
00:41:29,831 --> 00:41:32,994
Let us just imagine we two
are young, radical,

530
00:41:34,063 --> 00:41:37,746
bohemian experimenters,
hand in hand,

531
00:41:38,405 --> 00:41:41,168
on a journey to the outer
reaches of the universe,

532
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:46,354
and we are riding on
the front of a wave of light.

533
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:49,616
I really don't know what you are suggesting,
Herr Einstein.

534
00:41:50,066 --> 00:41:52,054
Do you wish to hold my hand or ridicule me?

535
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,998
Ridicule you? No, never.

536
00:41:56,849 --> 00:41:58,998
I merely want you to help me to understand.

537
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:03,972
What would we see, do you think,
if we were together,

538
00:42:04,664 --> 00:42:10,137
and we sped up and up until we caught up

539
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:14,848
to the front of a beam of light?

540
00:42:22,188 --> 00:42:24,676
It was Einstein's relentless
pursuit of light,

541
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:28,042
which would bring about
a revolution in science.

542
00:42:28,726 --> 00:42:30,705
With light he would reinvent the universe

543
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:35,273
and find a hidden pathway
that would unite energy and mass.

544
00:42:45,241 --> 00:42:48,277
The term "c" in E=mc2

545
00:42:48,647 --> 00:42:51,773
stands for "celeritas".
It's Latin for "swiftness".

546
00:42:52,343 --> 00:42:55,418
It's a recognition of light's
incredible speed,

547
00:42:55,875 --> 00:43:01,798
faster then any other known substance,
670 million mph.

548
00:43:14,502 --> 00:43:19,026
Long before the 19th century,
scientists had computed the speed of light,

549
00:43:19,884 --> 00:43:22,177
but no one knew what light actually was.

550
00:43:22,916 --> 00:43:28,407
Back in England, a man we've already met
was willing to make an educated guess.

551
00:43:31,397 --> 00:43:35,977
After Sir Humphry Davy's death,
Michael Faraday became Professor Faraday,

552
00:43:36,436 --> 00:43:39,375
one of the most important
experimenters in the world.

553
00:43:41,883 --> 00:43:45,127
The scientific establishment still
found it hard to accept

554
00:43:45,228 --> 00:43:47,428
that electricity and magnetism

555
00:43:47,594 --> 00:43:50,142
were just two aspects
of the same phenomenon,

556
00:43:50,601 --> 00:43:54,182
which Faraday called
"electromagnetism".

557
00:43:54,996 --> 00:44:00,937
But now he has an even more
outrageous proposal for his audience.

558
00:44:01,747 --> 00:44:04,824
...invisible lines that can

559
00:44:04,925 --> 00:44:08,025
emanate from electricity

560
00:44:08,185 --> 00:44:12,265
in a wire, from a magnet, or

561
00:44:12,366 --> 00:44:15,366
even from the sun.

562
00:44:16,759 --> 00:44:21,306
For it is my contention that light itself

563
00:44:21,696 --> 00:44:25,122
is just one form of these

564
00:44:25,223 --> 00:44:30,123
vibrating lines of electromagnetism.

565
00:44:32,054 --> 00:44:34,636
For 15 years, Faraday struggled
to convince the skeptics

566
00:44:35,327 --> 00:44:37,498
that Light was an electromagnetic wave,

567
00:44:38,374 --> 00:44:41,489
but he lacked the advanced
mathematics to back up his idea.

568
00:44:42,524 --> 00:44:44,979
Eventually, someone came to his rescue.

569
00:44:46,888 --> 00:44:51,162
Professor James Clark Maxwell believed
in Faraday's farsighted vision,

570
00:44:51,768 --> 00:44:54,636
and he had all the mathematical
skill to prove it.

571
00:45:03,924 --> 00:45:08,256
Maxwell and the aging Faraday
became close friends.

572
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:18,110
James, James, forgive me.

573
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,450
A word of advice: don't get old.

574
00:45:23,823 --> 00:45:25,267
Michael, how are you?

575
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:26,742
Oh, I'm fine.

576
00:45:26,878 --> 00:45:28,546
Memory isn't too good though.

577
00:45:29,245 --> 00:45:31,337
Well, I thought you might like
to see what I've just published.

578
00:45:31,797 --> 00:45:36,426
Oh, yes, yes, splendid.

579
00:45:43,439 --> 00:45:46,475
So your results show that when
electricity flows along a wire

580
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:50,226
what it actually does is
create a little bit of magnetism.

581
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:56,143
As that magnetic charge moves
it creates a little piece of electricity.

582
00:45:56,244 --> 00:45:57,505
Electricity?

583
00:45:57,884 --> 00:46:00,015
Electricity and magnetism are interwoven,

584
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:05,615
like a never-ending braid,
so it is always pulsing forward.

585
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,198
That's wonderful.

586
00:46:10,513 --> 00:46:14,948
Michael, Michael.

587
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,235
There's something very crucial in the math.

588
00:46:17,607 --> 00:46:20,842
This electricity producing magnetism
and magnetism producing electricity,

589
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:24,417
it can only ever happen at a
very particular speed.

590
00:46:25,142 --> 00:46:27,108
The equations are very clear about it.

591
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:29,936
They come up with just one number,

592
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:35,037
670 million miles per hour.

593
00:46:35,488 --> 00:46:36,661
I'm not sure I...

594
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,156
It's the speed of light.

595
00:46:38,655 --> 00:46:40,988
That is the speed of light.

596
00:46:41,814 --> 00:46:43,563
You were right all along,

597
00:46:43,918 --> 00:46:47,874
light is an electromagnetic wave.

598
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:53,355
Maxwell had proven Faraday right.

599
00:46:53,899 --> 00:46:58,702
Electricity and magnetism are just
two aspects of a deeper unity,

600
00:46:59,084 --> 00:47:02,118
a force, now called electromagnetism,

601
00:47:02,512 --> 00:47:06,270
which travels at 670 million
miles per hour.

602
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:12,481
In its visible form it is nothing
other than light itself.

603
00:47:15,116 --> 00:47:20,576
And nothing fascinated the young
Einstein more than light.

604
00:47:40,327 --> 00:47:42,370
We have lectures in half an hour.

605
00:47:42,767 --> 00:47:45,675
Oh, let me think: Professor Weber
and his life-draining monologue

606
00:47:46,157 --> 00:47:51,554
or you, Mozart and James Clark Maxwell?

607
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,334
We can't. We'll get a warning.

608
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,205
Our project is too precious to waste
time listening to those dullards.

609
00:47:57,884 --> 00:48:02,800
Come with me. We'll read Maxwell and think
about the electromagnetic theory of light.

610
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:08,754
Oh, why, my dear little Johnnie,
how you enchant a lady.

611
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:33,254
She's very pretty.

612
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:40,813
Yes, but can she soar and dance
like our dark souls do?

613
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:47,036
Maxwell's equations contained
an incredible prediction.

614
00:48:47,469 --> 00:48:49,426
They said you could never catch up
to a beam of light.

615
00:48:50,348 --> 00:48:53,113
Even if you were traveling at
670 million miles an hour,

616
00:48:53,709 --> 00:48:57,872
you would still see light squiggle
away from you at 670 million miles an hour.

617
00:49:00,498 --> 00:49:02,136
Do you see how she stares at that wave?

618
00:49:02,507 --> 00:49:03,887
Yes.

619
00:49:04,011 --> 00:49:05,894
- You see how, for her, it is static?
- Yes.

620
00:49:07,763 --> 00:49:09,746
She and the wave are traveling
at the same speed.

621
00:49:10,671 --> 00:49:13,208
We see the moving through the water.

622
00:49:14,147 --> 00:49:16,216
But relative to her it just sits there.

623
00:49:17,828 --> 00:49:19,754
So is light like that?

624
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,657
Common sense would say that
if you caught up to a light beam,

625
00:49:23,035 --> 00:49:25,887
there would be a wave of light,
just sitting there.

626
00:49:26,234 --> 00:49:30,201
Maybe it would be shimmering,
a bit of electricity and a bit of magnetism.

627
00:49:30,673 --> 00:49:34,156
So, if she was traveling alongside
the light wave it wouldn't be moving.

628
00:49:34,614 --> 00:49:38,977
It would be static. But Maxwell says
you can't have static light.

629
00:49:39,571 --> 00:49:43,265
Maybe Maxwell is wrong. Maybe if you
catch up to light it is static,

630
00:49:43,818 --> 00:49:47,406
Albert, like a wave next to a boat.

631
00:49:48,275 --> 00:49:51,799
Imagine if I were sitting still and
holding a mirror to my face.

632
00:49:52,682 --> 00:49:55,859
And the light travels from my face
to the mirror, and I see my face.

633
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,760
Yes.

634
00:49:57,898 --> 00:50:01,356
However, if I and the mirror

635
00:50:01,407 --> 00:50:05,007
were traveling at the speed of light?

636
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:07,019
You're going at the same speed
as the light leaving your face?

637
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,020
Exactly.

638
00:50:09,103 --> 00:50:12,508
The light never reaches the mirror?

639
00:50:13,015 --> 00:50:16,107
So would I be invisible?

640
00:50:18,604 --> 00:50:20,121
That doesn't make sense.

641
00:50:23,736 --> 00:50:28,780
Young Einstein was starting to realize that
light was unlike any other kind of wave.

642
00:50:33,886 --> 00:50:37,849
Einstein was about to enter a surreal
universe where energy,

643
00:50:38,246 --> 00:50:40,801
mass and the speed of light
intermingled in a way

644
00:50:41,237 --> 00:50:43,274
no one had ever suspected.

645
00:50:44,852 --> 00:50:48,912
But there was one last mathematical
ingredient that Einstein would need,

646
00:50:50,059 --> 00:50:53,959
the everyday process of squaring.

647
00:51:05,497 --> 00:51:07,141
Long before the French Revolution,

648
00:51:07,242 --> 00:51:11,000
scientists were not sure
how to quantify motion.

649
00:51:11,136 --> 00:51:14,708
Equations that explained how objects moved

650
00:51:15,215 --> 00:51:17,147
and collided were in their infancy.

651
00:51:22,486 --> 00:51:27,359
A crucial contribution to this subject would
come from an unusual source.

652
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:34,624
Meet the aristocratic, 16-year old daughter

653
00:51:35,075 --> 00:51:39,990
of one of King Louis the XIV courtiers,
Emilie Du Chtelet.

654
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:51,916
Quickly, father's coming.

655
00:51:55,369 --> 00:51:58,237
Emilie du Chtelet would have a
huge effect on physics

656
00:51:58,592 --> 00:52:00,651
in her tragically short lifetime.

657
00:52:01,193 --> 00:52:03,656
Unheard of, for a woman
in the eighteenth century,

658
00:52:04,315 --> 00:52:05,750
she would publish many scientific works,

659
00:52:06,107 --> 00:52:09,478
including a translation of
Sir Isaac Newton's Principia,

660
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:12,300
the greatest treatise on
motion ever written.

661
00:52:13,668 --> 00:52:18,897
Du Chtelet's translation is still
the standard text in France today.

662
00:52:19,894 --> 00:52:23,076
Musa, mihi causas memora?

663
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:25,603
Muse, my memory causes...?

664
00:52:26,061 --> 00:52:27,714
"O Muse. The causes and the crimes relate;

665
00:52:28,381 --> 00:52:30,627
what goddess was provok'd,
and whence her hate;

666
00:52:31,092 --> 00:52:36,505
For what offence the Queen of Heav'n began
to persecute so brave, so just a man".

667
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:40,009
Do not be cross with your sister because
she persecutes many a just man.

668
00:52:40,412 --> 00:52:43,281
Only the other night Emilie
silenced the Duc du Luynes

669
00:52:43,588 --> 00:52:45,735
when she divided a ridiculously long number

670
00:52:46,091 --> 00:52:47,527
in her head in a matter of seconds.

671
00:52:47,916 --> 00:52:49,719
You should have seen the
incredulity on their faces

672
00:52:50,186 --> 00:52:52,527
when they realized Emilie was correct.

673
00:52:53,154 --> 00:52:56,541
Was it my sister's astounding
intelligence or her boundless beauty

674
00:52:56,945 --> 00:52:58,629
that made their mouths gape, I wonder?

675
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,875
Ah well, yes, you have a point, Monsieur.

676
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:03,269
Messieurs, I thank you for your kindness.

677
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,853
I fear, however, that my wit is
only a curiosity to others.

678
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,979
If only my mind was permitted opportunity.

679
00:53:10,352 --> 00:53:13,777
My dearest, Emilie. You are blessed
with intellect and courage.

680
00:53:14,143 --> 00:53:16,957
Use them both and the world
will fall at your feet.

681
00:53:22,767 --> 00:53:26,116
In one sense, she is a woman utterly
out of her true time and place.

682
00:53:27,094 --> 00:53:31,250
She is a philosopher, a scientist,
a mathematician, a linguist.

683
00:53:31,661 --> 00:53:35,795
She demands a freedom that women didn't
begin to enjoy until over 150 years later,

684
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:41,244
a freedom to study science,
to write about it and to be published.

685
00:53:45,073 --> 00:53:47,517
Du Chtelet married a general
in the French army

686
00:53:47,919 --> 00:53:50,627
at age nineteen and had three children.

687
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:55,587
She ran a busy household, all the
while pursuing her passion for science.

688
00:53:56,341 --> 00:53:59,496
She was 23 when she discovered
advanced mathematics.

689
00:53:59,917 --> 00:54:02,577
She enthusiastically took
lessons from one of

690
00:54:02,598 --> 00:54:04,978
the greatest mathematicians
of the day,

691
00:54:04,995 --> 00:54:06,769
Pierre de Maupertuis.

692
00:54:07,132 --> 00:54:10,368
He was an expert on Newton,
and she was his eager young student.

693
00:54:10,859 --> 00:54:12,494
It seems they had a brief affair.

694
00:54:12,986 --> 00:54:15,462
But then he set off on a Polar Expedition.

695
00:54:16,487 --> 00:54:19,396
Du Chtelet then fell passionately
in love with Voltaire,

696
00:54:19,855 --> 00:54:21,603
France's greatest poet.

697
00:54:21,999 --> 00:54:24,418
A fierce critic of the King and
the Catholic Church,

698
00:54:24,965 --> 00:54:28,161
Voltaire had been in prison twice
and exiled to England,

699
00:54:28,685 --> 00:54:31,826
where he became enthralled
by the ideas of Newton.

700
00:54:32,541 --> 00:54:36,040
Back in France, it wasn't long
before he again insulted the King.

701
00:54:36,603 --> 00:54:39,358
Du Chtelet hid him in her country home.

702
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:43,248
The poor little creature is devoted to him.

703
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:47,234
Isolated far from Paris, Du Chtelet
and Voltaire turned her chateau

704
00:54:47,285 --> 00:54:50,235
into a palace of learning and culture

705
00:54:50,974 --> 00:54:52,747
complete with its
own tiny theatre

706
00:54:53,318 --> 00:54:56,201
and all with the apparent
blessing of her husband.

707
00:54:57,486 --> 00:55:00,467
There is a great deal of myth surrounding
Du Chtelet and her love life.

708
00:55:01,061 --> 00:55:03,225
And most of it is very exaggerated.

709
00:55:03,636 --> 00:55:06,552
But her husband did accept
Voltaire into his household,

710
00:55:06,892 --> 00:55:09,288
and he often went to Paris
on behalf of Voltaire.

711
00:55:09,635 --> 00:55:11,655
He went to his publisher
to plead Voltaires' case,

712
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:13,303
to keep Voltaire out of jail.

713
00:55:14,723 --> 00:55:18,078
And it is also true that Emilie Du Chtelet
did have several affairs

714
00:55:18,498 --> 00:55:20,653
of a fleeting nature.

715
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:30,771
She created an institution to rival that
of France's Royal Academy of Sciences.

716
00:55:31,538 --> 00:55:36,206
Many of the great philosophers,
poets and scientists of the day visited.

717
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,922
Ah, Monsieur you are young.

718
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:45,977
I hope that soon you will judge me
for my own merits or lack of them,

719
00:55:46,533 --> 00:55:49,717
but do not look upon me as an
appendage to this great general

720
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:51,459
or that renowned scholar.

721
00:55:52,752 --> 00:55:54,620
I am, in my own right, a whole person,

722
00:55:55,649 --> 00:55:58,355
responsible to myself alone
for all that I am,

723
00:55:59,262 --> 00:56:02,938
all that I say, all that I do.

724
00:56:07,325 --> 00:56:09,603
Du Chtelet learned from the
brilliant men around her,

725
00:56:10,213 --> 00:56:12,289
but she quickly developed ideas of her own.

726
00:56:12,997 --> 00:56:16,697
Much to the horror of her mentors,
she even dared to suspect

727
00:56:16,853 --> 00:56:20,039
that there was a error in the great
Sir Isaac Newton's thinking.

728
00:56:21,355 --> 00:56:23,598
Newton stated that the energy of an object,

729
00:56:23,986 --> 00:56:26,538
the force with which it collided
with another object,

730
00:56:27,142 --> 00:56:30,986
could very simply be accounted for
by its mass times its velocity.

731
00:56:32,293 --> 00:56:34,426
In correspondence with
scientists in Germany,

732
00:56:34,869 --> 00:56:38,609
Du Chtelet learned of another view,
that of Gottfried Leibniz.

733
00:56:39,623 --> 00:56:43,062
He proposed that moving objects
had a kind of inner spirit.

734
00:56:43,743 --> 00:56:47,427
He called it "vis viva",
Latin for "living force".

735
00:56:47,774 --> 00:56:52,692
Many discounted his ideas,
but Leibniz was convinced

736
00:56:52,793 --> 00:56:54,093
that the energy of an object

737
00:56:54,164 --> 00:56:58,673
was made up of its mass times
its speed, squared.

738
00:57:01,281 --> 00:57:03,524
Taking the square of something
is an ancient procedure.

739
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:05,596
If you say a garden is "four square,"

740
00:57:05,951 --> 00:57:08,763
you mean that it might be built up by
four slabs along one edge and four

741
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:12,321
along the other so the total number of
paving slabs is four times four, is 16.

742
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:15,555
If the garden is eight square,
eight by eight,

743
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,658
well eight squared is 64,
it'll have 64 slabs in it.

744
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,290
This huge multiplication,
this building up by squares

745
00:57:21,676 --> 00:57:24,149
is something you'd find
in nature all the time.

746
00:57:25,301 --> 00:57:28,674
Emilie, Emilie, you are being absurd.

747
00:57:29,068 --> 00:57:34,368
Why ascribe to an object a vague and
immeasurable force like vis viva?

748
00:57:34,829 --> 00:57:38,585
It is a return to the old ways.

749
00:57:38,638 --> 00:57:40,982
It is the occult.

750
00:57:43,436 --> 00:57:46,954
When movement commences, you say
it is true that a force is produced

751
00:57:47,316 --> 00:57:48,560
which did not exist until now.

752
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:52,119
Think of our bodies, to have free will
we must be free to initiate motion.

753
00:57:52,482 --> 00:57:55,600
So, all Leibniz is asking is,
"Where does all this force come from"?

754
00:57:55,938 --> 00:57:58,659
In your case, my dear, the force,
I'm sure, is primeval.

755
00:57:59,073 --> 00:58:02,338
Aaah, you're infuriating.
You hide behind wit and sarcasm.

756
00:58:02,828 --> 00:58:04,353
You only think you understand Newton.

757
00:58:04,757 --> 00:58:06,281
You are incapable of understanding Leibniz.

758
00:58:07,676 --> 00:58:09,305
You are a provocateur.

759
00:58:09,683 --> 00:58:11,608
Everything you do is about something else
and makes trouble for you.

760
00:58:12,112 --> 00:58:14,799
Criticize this, denounce that.

761
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:17,800
Are you capable of discovering
something of your own?

762
00:58:21,796 --> 00:58:23,969
I discovered you.

763
00:58:30,302 --> 00:58:32,153
Despite the overwhelming support for Newton,

764
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:34,870
Du Chtelet did not waver in her belief.

765
00:58:42,792 --> 00:58:46,682
Eventually, she came across an
experiment performed by a Dutch scientist,

766
00:58:47,309 --> 00:58:50,216
Willem 'sGravesande that
would prove her point.

767
00:58:52,255 --> 00:58:56,149
'sGravesande, in Leiden, has been
dropping lead balls into a pan of clay.

768
00:58:56,583 --> 00:58:58,083
Dropping lead balls into clay?

769
00:58:59,495 --> 00:59:01,433
How very imaginative.

770
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:05,064
Using Newton's formulas, Monsieur Voltaire

771
00:59:05,165 --> 00:59:07,665
he then drops a second ball
from a higher height,

772
00:59:07,688 --> 00:59:11,980
calculated to exactly double
the speed of the first ball on impact.

773
00:59:12,542 --> 00:59:14,763
So, Messieurs, care for a little wager?

774
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:19,690
Newton tells us that by doubling
the speed of the ball,

775
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:22,969
we will double the distance
it travels into the clay.

776
00:59:23,619 --> 00:59:26,657
Leibniz asks us to square that speed.

777
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:31,472
If he is correct the ball will travel
not two, but four times as far.

778
00:59:32,571 --> 00:59:34,383
So who is correct?

779
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:39,985
Messieurs, I feel Mister Newton's
reputation dwindling, ever so slightly.

780
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:43,078
Oh, Maupertuis, do not succumb to her.
There is no earthly reason

781
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:48,079
to ascribe hidden forces to this
Dutchman's lead balls.

782
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:56,088
Well, the ball travels
four times further.

783
00:59:58,187 --> 01:00:01,017
Turns out Leibniz is the one who is right.

784
01:00:01,443 --> 01:00:03,567
It's the best way to express
the energy of a moving object.

785
01:00:04,163 --> 01:00:06,167
If you drive a car at twenty miles an hour,

786
01:00:06,546 --> 01:00:08,760
it takes a certain distance to stop
if you slam on the breaks.

787
01:00:09,114 --> 01:00:10,366
If you're going three times as fast,

788
01:00:10,714 --> 01:00:13,252
your going sixty miles an hour, it won't
take you three times as long to stop,

789
01:00:13,649 --> 01:00:16,204
it'll take you nine times as long to stop.

790
01:00:16,974 --> 01:00:21,723
Oh. Well, it does seem worth consideration.

791
01:00:22,198 --> 01:00:24,353
Perhaps we might look over his calculations?

792
01:00:24,909 --> 01:00:26,211
I have already checked his figures.

793
01:00:27,781 --> 01:00:29,418
I am sure Leibniz is correct on this point.

794
01:00:30,484 --> 01:00:32,985
I intend to include a section
on this matter in my book.

795
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:37,383
Really? Do be careful, Madame.

796
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:41,447
Do you think the Academy
is ready for such an opinion?

797
01:00:41,501 --> 01:00:44,081
Quite, quite. We really should be careful...

798
01:00:44,749 --> 01:00:50,550
"We?" I see no reason to delay.
There is no right time for the truth.

799
01:00:53,514 --> 01:00:57,175
Emilie du Chtelet published her
Institutions of Physics in 1740,

800
01:00:57,584 --> 01:01:00,326
and it provoked great controversy.

801
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:07,556
Voltaire wrote that "she was
a great man whose only

802
01:01:07,975 --> 01:01:10,317
fault was being a woman".

803
01:01:10,903 --> 01:01:13,883
In her day that was a great compliment.

804
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:29,943
I am with child.

805
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,460
You are sure?

806
01:01:37,896 --> 01:01:41,956
Undoubtedly. Two to three months.

807
01:01:42,911 --> 01:01:45,795
- I'm afraid...
- You are afraid?

808
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:49,098
Well you should have...

809
01:01:55,221 --> 01:01:56,890
Oh, well, this child is obviously not mine,

810
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:01,800
nor is it your husband's.

811
01:02:06,962 --> 01:02:09,718
Oh, Emilie, Emilie.

812
01:02:12,053 --> 01:02:14,628
Emilie Du Chtelet knew
that in the 18th century,

813
01:02:15,053 --> 01:02:17,008
for a woman to become pregnant
at the age of forty-three

814
01:02:17,388 --> 01:02:19,833
was really very dangerous, and all
the while she was pregnant

815
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:23,553
she had terrible premonitions
about what was going to happen.

816
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:30,122
All her life Du Chtelet had tried to rise
above the limitations placed on her gender.

817
01:02:31,397 --> 01:02:35,328
In the end it was an affair with a young
soldier that led to her demise.

818
01:02:36,428 --> 01:02:38,575
Six days after giving birth
to her fourth child

819
01:02:39,346 --> 01:02:42,478
she suffered an embolism and died.

820
01:02:47,574 --> 01:02:49,876
Emilie du Chtelet's unwavering belief,

821
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:53,882
that the energy of an object is a function
of the square of its speed,

822
01:02:54,358 --> 01:02:57,401
sparked a debate that was
as long as it was fierce.

823
01:02:58,093 --> 01:03:01,760
After her death it took a hundred years
for the idea to be accepted

824
01:03:03,053 --> 01:03:06,415
just in time for Einstein to use
this brilliant insight

825
01:03:06,892 --> 01:03:11,680
to finally bring energy and mass
together with light.

826
01:03:20,919 --> 01:03:25,556
After the University Einstein had
all the parts of E=mc2.

827
01:03:26,214 --> 01:03:31,057
Energy, mass, the speed of light and squared
were now the staples of modern physics.

828
01:03:31,693 --> 01:03:34,377
But Einstein now longer had
an academic position.

829
01:03:34,749 --> 01:03:38,047
He'd upset so many professors that
no one would write him a reference.

830
01:03:38,553 --> 01:03:41,581
He accepted a low paying job in
the Swiss patent office.

831
01:03:41,959 --> 01:03:45,277
He and Mileva married and had a child.
The young family struggled,

832
01:03:45,819 --> 01:03:48,295
but none of it seems to bother Albert.

833
01:03:49,052 --> 01:03:53,281
Einstein, I see you are busy as usual.

834
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:58,919
Look, Einstein,

835
01:04:00,081 --> 01:04:02,821
you have shown some
quite good achievements.

836
01:04:03,185 --> 01:04:06,277
But listen, about your promotion,

837
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:09,740
I really think it would
be better to wait until you have become

838
01:04:09,841 --> 01:04:12,041
more fully familiar
with mechanical engineering.

839
01:04:12,127 --> 01:04:17,931
I'm sorry, perhaps next time.

840
01:04:22,981 --> 01:04:26,106
But I wanted to hire a maid so I can
get back and finish my degree.

841
01:04:26,549 --> 01:04:28,560
Now I'll never pass my dissertation.

842
01:04:29,217 --> 01:04:32,237
Oh, come, come, my pretty little duck.
All will be fine, you'll see.

843
01:04:32,792 --> 01:04:35,988
But how will it be fine Albert? Do I have
to just wait another year,

844
01:04:35,999 --> 01:04:37,989
until you are promoted?

845
01:04:50,575 --> 01:04:55,069
All will be fine. All will be fine.
You'll see.

846
01:04:57,989 --> 01:05:01,842
There really is a very charming, but kind
of a self-centered streak to Einstein.

847
01:05:02,347 --> 01:05:03,914
He focuses only on his
particular obsessions.

848
01:05:04,259 --> 01:05:06,295
If the rest of the world fits in
around him, that's fine,

849
01:05:06,699 --> 01:05:09,008
if they can't, it doesn't bother him.

850
01:05:52,274 --> 01:05:53,942
Albert, Albert, Albert.

851
01:05:54,273 --> 01:05:56,359
A pretty neck and your head spins.

852
01:05:56,712 --> 01:05:59,884
Besso, we must behold and
comprehend the mysterious.

853
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:02,741
Well, that kind of mysterious
is going to get you into trouble.

854
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:07,427
I'll tell you what is truly mysterious,
the secret of a long and happy marriage.

855
01:06:08,231 --> 01:06:12,067
The mathematics are fine,
if a little unconventional.

856
01:06:12,412 --> 01:06:14,392
But this only works for big systems.

857
01:06:14,857 --> 01:06:17,316
It'll fall down when you apply
it to small systems.

858
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:18,571
I disagree.

859
01:06:18,871 --> 01:06:21,769
Oh, no, here we go: another grand
theory by Herr Albert Einstein,

860
01:06:22,141 --> 01:06:23,954
Patent Clerk, Third Class.

861
01:06:25,063 --> 01:06:29,027
What would happen if one applied those
formulae to electromagnetic radiation?

862
01:06:29,374 --> 01:06:32,089
Albert, you can't just borrow one
bit of physics and apply it,

863
01:06:32,412 --> 01:06:34,793
without proper regard,
to a completely different area.

864
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:36,848
Why not?

865
01:06:37,499 --> 01:06:41,815
Albert, I know you like the grand linkages,
the big theories,

866
01:06:42,146 --> 01:06:45,898
but wouldn't things be better
all'round if you just got going

867
01:06:45,999 --> 01:06:47,299
in some small area,
got a university post.

868
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:50,326
Get a decent wage, for God's sake.

869
01:06:50,754 --> 01:06:53,964
At least Mileva could study again. Then
she'd be happy and you'd be happy.

870
01:06:55,162 --> 01:06:57,479
Ah, the vulgar struggle for survival,

871
01:06:57,897 --> 01:07:01,911
food and sex: spoken like a
true bourgeois.

872
01:07:02,812 --> 01:07:07,266
Besso. I want to know how
God created this world.

873
01:07:07,907 --> 01:07:10,234
I am not interested in this
or that phenomenon,

874
01:07:10,715 --> 01:07:12,487
in the spectrum of this or that element.

875
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:18,391
I want to know his thoughts.
The rest are details.

876
01:07:18,977 --> 01:07:22,324
Yes, but you can't feed your children
on his thoughts, Bertie.

877
01:07:34,222 --> 01:07:37,619
So it turns out Einstein was going for walk
with his very close friend Michele Besso.

878
01:07:37,973 --> 01:07:40,297
They'd studied physics together and
talked about physics and philosophy

879
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,954
for years and years.
They were very close.

880
01:07:43,717 --> 01:07:46,552
They had cornered the question of light
from every possible angle.

881
01:07:51,517 --> 01:07:55,402
As Einstein was ruminating on
how long it would take light

882
01:07:55,448 --> 01:07:58,004
to reach him from clocks
at different distances,

883
01:07:58,265 --> 01:08:02,365
he had a monumental insight.

884
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:14,156
Thank you, thank you!

885
01:08:15,429 --> 01:08:19,193
I have completely solved the problem.

886
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:23,833
Albert?

887
01:08:27,847 --> 01:08:30,644
What Einstein did was completely
turn the problem on its head.

888
01:08:32,415 --> 01:08:35,491
Other scientists had found it impossible
to accept Maxwell's idea

889
01:08:35,981 --> 01:08:38,993
that light would always move away
from you at 670 million miles an hour,

890
01:08:39,437 --> 01:08:41,288
even if you, too,
were traveling really fast.

891
01:08:41,604 --> 01:08:43,467
But Einstein just accepted that as a fact:

892
01:08:43,996 --> 01:08:46,800
light's speed never ever changes.

893
01:08:47,338 --> 01:08:49,801
Then what he did was bend everything we know

894
01:08:50,185 --> 01:08:52,166
about the universe to fit
light's fixed speed.

895
01:08:53,169 --> 01:08:57,781
What he discovered was that to do that
you have to slow down time.

896
01:08:59,583 --> 01:09:02,044
His extraordinary insight is that time...

897
01:09:02,815 --> 01:09:05,427
as you approach the speed of light,
time itself will slow down.

898
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:09,351
It's a monumental shift
in how we see the world.

899
01:09:14,677 --> 01:09:18,803
The instant, the very instant when
Einstein had this brilliant insight

900
01:09:19,205 --> 01:09:21,047
that time could slow down,well

901
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:23,906
the floodgates began to open.

902
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:31,568
You see, before then people had assumed
that time was like a wristwatch

903
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:36,011
on God's hand, that it beat at a steady rate

904
01:09:36,112 --> 01:09:39,012
throughout the universe
no matter where you were.

905
01:09:40,102 --> 01:09:41,436
Einstein said no,

906
01:09:41,805 --> 01:09:44,098
that the tick, tick, tick of
this wristwatch

907
01:09:44,309 --> 01:09:48,681
was actually the click, click, click of
electricity turning into magnetism

908
01:09:49,108 --> 01:09:53,448
turning into electricity in other words,
the steady pace of light itself.

909
01:10:03,511 --> 01:10:06,718
1905 was a miraculous year for
Einstein and for physics.

910
01:10:10,183 --> 01:10:12,245
He had an unbelievable
outpouring of creativity.

911
01:10:13,638 --> 01:10:16,890
It starts with his publication of a paper on
how to work out the true size of atoms.

912
01:10:18,364 --> 01:10:21,587
Two months later is the publication of
his paper on the nature of light.

913
01:10:22,068 --> 01:10:23,330
That's what will earn him the Nobel Prize.

914
01:10:23,732 --> 01:10:27,432
The third paper, only a month later is
on how molecules move when heated,

915
01:10:27,803 --> 01:10:30,638
and that finally ends the debate on
whether atoms really exist.

916
01:10:31,363 --> 01:10:33,968
The fourth paper is published
at the end of this half-year period.

917
01:10:34,453 --> 01:10:37,336
In it Einstein sets out his theory of
light, time and space.

918
01:10:38,107 --> 01:10:42,822
It was the "Theory of Special Relativity"
that changed the way we see the world.

919
01:10:43,718 --> 01:10:46,683
In Einstein's new world,
the one true constant

920
01:10:47,214 --> 01:10:51,041
was not time or even
space, but light.

921
01:11:01,536 --> 01:11:03,861
But Einstein's miracle year was not over;

922
01:11:09,718 --> 01:11:12,331
in one last great 1905 paper,

923
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:14,978
he would propose an
even deeper unity.

924
01:11:18,029 --> 01:11:20,801
As he computed all the implications
of his new theory

925
01:11:21,221 --> 01:11:23,529
he noticed another strange connection,

926
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:26,263
energy and mass were being
forced together

927
01:11:26,364 --> 01:11:31,864
by light's incredible but fixed speed.

928
01:11:44,449 --> 01:11:48,086
Einstein realizes that the speed of light is
kind of like a cosmic speed limit,

929
01:11:49,144 --> 01:11:50,645
nothing can go faster.

930
01:11:54,023 --> 01:11:56,803
So imagine we have a train charging along.
And let's say it's getting up to the

931
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:59,088
speed of light, and we're
stuffing more and more energy in

932
01:11:59,444 --> 01:12:01,297
trying to get it to go faster and faster,

933
01:12:02,363 --> 01:12:04,375
but it's still bumping up
against the speed of light.

934
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:07,090
So all this energy, where does it go?

935
01:12:07,524 --> 01:12:09,376
It has to go somewhere.

936
01:12:09,723 --> 01:12:11,327
Amazingly it goes into the object's mass.

937
01:12:12,923 --> 01:12:15,342
From our point of view,
the train actually gets heavier.

938
01:12:16,155 --> 01:12:17,998
The energy becomes mass.

939
01:12:27,628 --> 01:12:29,396
It's an incredible idea.

940
01:12:29,483 --> 01:12:31,373
Even Einstein is amazed by it.

941
01:12:34,518 --> 01:12:39,684
Look. I think I have found a connection
between energy and mass.

942
01:12:40,142 --> 01:12:43,810
If I am right then energy and
mass are not absolute.

943
01:12:44,596 --> 01:12:45,554
They are not distinct.

944
01:12:47,236 --> 01:12:49,426
They can be converted into one another.

945
01:12:50,604 --> 01:12:53,656
Energy can become mass,
and mass can become energy,

946
01:12:54,610 --> 01:12:57,375
and not just energy equaling mass.

947
01:12:58,497 --> 01:13:03,532
Energy equals mass times
the square of the speed of light.

948
01:13:06,989 --> 01:13:09,055
Would you like me
to check your mathematics?

949
01:13:16,394 --> 01:13:21,150
Einstein sent his fifth great
1905 paper for publication.

950
01:13:22,016 --> 01:13:24,308
In three pages he simply stated

951
01:13:24,727 --> 01:13:28,917
that energy and mass were connected
by the square of the speed of light:

952
01:13:29,519 --> 01:13:33,635
E=mc2.

953
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:41,240
With four familiar notes
in the scale of nature,

954
01:13:42,067 --> 01:13:45,512
this patent officer had composed
a totally fresh melody,

955
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:50,408
the culmination of his 10 year
journey into light.

956
01:13:58,102 --> 01:14:00,039
Here we are, for thousands
of years, thinking that

957
01:14:00,408 --> 01:14:02,709
over here is a world
of objects, of matter,

958
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,645
and over there is an entirely
separate world of movement,

959
01:14:06,104 --> 01:14:07,780
of forces, of energy.

960
01:14:08,103 --> 01:14:09,580
And Einstein says "No.
They are not separate.

961
01:14:09,999 --> 01:14:14,107
Energy can become mass. And crucially,
mass can also become energy".

962
01:14:14,509 --> 01:14:17,922
There is a deep unity between energy,
matter and light.

963
01:14:21,336 --> 01:14:22,853
"E = mc2."

964
01:14:23,265 --> 01:14:26,681
That equation shows that every
piece of matter in our universe

965
01:14:27,043 --> 01:14:30,553
has stored within it a
fantastic amount of energy.

966
01:14:30,986 --> 01:14:34,720
The speed of light for example is
about 300 million meters per second,

967
01:14:35,153 --> 01:14:38,999
You multiply that by itself
and you get 90 quadrillion.

968
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:40,918
So, in other words, what is matter?

969
01:14:41,288 --> 01:14:46,596
In some sense, matter is nothing but the
condensation of vast amounts of energy.

970
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:50,802
So, in other words, if you
could unlock, somehow unlock,

971
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:53,803
all the energy stored within my pen,

972
01:14:53,934 --> 01:14:58,449
that would erupt with a force
comparable to an atomic bomb.

973
01:15:07,914 --> 01:15:10,614
After Einstein's fifth great 1905 paper,

974
01:15:11,314 --> 01:15:14,449
physicists no longer spoke
of mass or energy.

975
01:15:15,358 --> 01:15:17,666
They are now the same thing to us.

976
01:15:32,267 --> 01:15:38,008
Probably the most miraculous year
in human science ends in silence.

977
01:15:39,738 --> 01:15:43,415
The articles are published
to resounding... nothing.

978
01:15:45,395 --> 01:15:47,736
I think the Gods are laughing at me.

979
01:15:52,734 --> 01:15:56,476
Then slowly it starts:
a letter here, a letter there.

980
01:15:57,190 --> 01:16:00,714
For four years Einstein answered
each inquiry dutifully,

981
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:06,961
trying to explain his difficult, complex
ideas to a confused physics community.

982
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:13,939
I love the idea that life
just went on as normal.

983
01:16:14,485 --> 01:16:18,240
Here are these universe-changing
papers circling around,

984
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:22,257
and the world is struggling
to come to terms with them.

985
01:16:25,711 --> 01:16:29,331
Einstein had a fan club of just one.
Luckily,

986
01:16:29,879 --> 01:16:33,658
it happened to be the
most important living physicist.

987
01:16:34,382 --> 01:16:36,954
Einstein, Einstein.

988
01:16:37,372 --> 01:16:41,080
Max Planck has sent someone
to see you.

989
01:16:41,565 --> 01:16:43,986
- Max Planck?
- Yes, he has sent his assistant.

990
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:46,908
He's here to see you.

991
01:16:51,755 --> 01:16:55,671
Max Planck encourages the
world's most eminent physicists

992
01:16:55,672 --> 01:16:58,672
to take Einstein seriously.

993
01:16:59,764 --> 01:17:05,167
After four years of waiting he was appointed
Professor of Physics at Zurich University.

994
01:17:06,108 --> 01:17:08,262
From there his career was meteoric.

995
01:17:14,842 --> 01:17:16,870
He was made Professor of Physics in Berlin,

996
01:17:17,266 --> 01:17:20,714
achieved world renown and
became a household name.

997
01:17:22,456 --> 01:17:26,030
He was the undisputed father
of modern physics.

998
01:17:38,288 --> 01:17:42,132
But Einstein's success was
the downfall of his marriage.

999
01:17:46,813 --> 01:17:50,978
In 1919, he divorced Mileva
and married his cousin.

1000
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:58,791
His fame led to numerous affairs.

1001
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:36,563
E = mc2 became the Holy Grail of science.

1002
01:18:37,076 --> 01:18:41,378
It held out the promise of vast reserves
of energy locked deep inside the atom.

1003
01:18:42,171 --> 01:18:46,320
Einstein suspected that it would take
a hundred years of research to unlock it.

1004
01:18:47,235 --> 01:18:51,359
But he hadn't banked on
the Second World War

1005
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:54,360
and the genius of a Jewish woman
in Hitler's Germany.

1006
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:11,672
Einstein had astounded
the world with E=mc2.

1007
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:15,173
It said that every single object
in the Universe is just a piece

1008
01:19:15,274 --> 01:19:17,674
of immensely compressed energy.

1009
01:19:17,832 --> 01:19:20,237
The ammount of energy
in an object is equal

1010
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:23,938
to its mass times c,
the speed of light, squared.

1011
01:19:25,599 --> 01:19:28,042
In other words, its energy is equal
to its mass

1012
01:19:28,143 --> 01:19:31,993
times 90 billion billion.

1013
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:36,620
But it would not be Einstein who
would unlock this vast energy.

1014
01:19:58,079 --> 01:20:02,003
Twenty-eight year old Austrian
Lise Meitner was painfully shy.

1015
01:20:02,696 --> 01:20:06,532
Despite her anxiety, the young
Doctor of Physics arrived in Berlin

1016
01:20:06,846 --> 01:20:11,491
determined to pursue a career in
the exciting, new field of radioactivity.

1017
01:20:13,527 --> 01:20:16,850
Unfortunately, in 1907, German universities

1018
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:20,081
did not employ women graduates.

1019
01:20:23,443 --> 01:20:26,328
Luckily, one man came to her aid.

1020
01:20:28,894 --> 01:20:31,946
- Fraulein Meitner?
- Yes.

1021
01:20:32,059 --> 01:20:36,720
Otto Hahn. I'm a researcher in the Chemistry
Institute. Professor Planck suggested I...

1022
01:20:37,179 --> 01:20:39,623
Ah yes, Herr Hahn. I have read both your
papers on Thorium and on Mesothorium.

1023
01:20:39,914 --> 01:20:41,695
Dr. Planck suggested that I...
Yes, he suggested that

1024
01:20:42,065 --> 01:20:44,159
I speak to you.
I need someone to collaborate with.

1025
01:20:44,538 --> 01:20:46,438
I think I could really help with
the physical analysis.

1026
01:20:46,721 --> 01:20:50,509
And the mathematics?
Yes, yes, and the mathematics.

1027
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:53,661
Studying radioactive atoms
has become so much a

1028
01:20:54,064 --> 01:20:55,824
collaboration between chemistry
and physics these days.

1029
01:20:56,679 --> 01:20:59,611
- Yes, yes.
- I'll ask Fischer for a laboratory then.

1030
01:21:00,214 --> 01:21:04,319
- Excellent.
- I'll speak to you soon.

1031
01:21:06,833 --> 01:21:09,638
Lise Meitner had just taken the
first step on a journey

1032
01:21:09,976 --> 01:21:12,540
that would irrevocably
change world history.

1033
01:21:12,936 --> 01:21:15,996
For her, it would be a road
marked with success and renown,

1034
01:21:16,927 --> 01:21:19,429
but also terror and betrayal.

1035
01:21:25,035 --> 01:21:27,649
At this time, not a lot was
known about the atom.

1036
01:21:29,906 --> 01:21:32,310
At first people thought it was
like a miniature cellular system,

1037
01:21:32,691 --> 01:21:35,759
there's a solid nucleus of the center
and electrons would spin around it,

1038
01:21:36,226 --> 01:21:38,262
sort of like planets
around our sun.

1039
01:21:39,264 --> 01:21:42,275
A little later, some researchers
proposed that the nucleus itself

1040
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:45,084
wasn't a solid chunk but
was made up of separate particles,

1041
01:21:45,416 --> 01:21:46,891
of protons and neutrons.

1042
01:21:47,675 --> 01:21:50,928
But then, in what are called radioactive
metals, things like radium and uranium,

1043
01:21:51,410 --> 01:21:55,062
the nucleus itself seemed to be unstable,
leaking out energy and particles.

1044
01:21:56,153 --> 01:21:58,917
Perhaps this was an example of E = mc2,

1045
01:21:59,255 --> 01:22:01,708
the mass of a nucleus turning into energy?

1046
01:22:07,041 --> 01:22:10,529
Meitner and Hahn's collaboration
to unlock the secrets of the atom,

1047
01:22:10,995 --> 01:22:13,914
started out on an
extremely unequal footing.

1048
01:22:14,548 --> 01:22:18,526
He was given a laboratory.
She was forced to work in a woodshop.

1049
01:22:19,335 --> 01:22:20,996
I see you haven't set your hair on fire?

1050
01:22:22,638 --> 01:22:24,582
- Herr Hahn?
- The boss. He thinks that

1051
01:22:24,601 --> 01:22:27,897
if he lets women into the Chemistry
Institute they'll set their hair on fire.

1052
01:22:28,628 --> 01:22:31,721
Ah, so his beard must be fireproof.

1053
01:22:35,317 --> 01:22:36,795
Good day, Herr Hahn.

1054
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:38,689
Good day.

1055
01:22:41,652 --> 01:22:45,718
You see. I am nonexistent
to this place.

1056
01:22:46,571 --> 01:22:49,832
At least physicists recognize
me for my abilities.

1057
01:22:50,447 --> 01:22:55,316
Ah, yes, where would we chemists be
without the steadying hand of the physicist?

1058
01:23:09,288 --> 01:23:12,525
It took years, but Lise lost her
shyness eventually.

1059
01:23:13,719 --> 01:23:17,420
In 1912, she and Hahn moved to the
brand new Kaiser Wilhelm Institute

1060
01:23:17,878 --> 01:23:20,963
for Chemistry where their status
was really that of equals.

1061
01:23:24,328 --> 01:23:28,066
Lise became the first woman in
Germany to have the title of Professor.

1062
01:23:46,408 --> 01:23:50,142
Lise, I have news.

1063
01:23:53,591 --> 01:23:55,908
You remember the art student I told you of?

1064
01:23:56,774 --> 01:23:57,971
Yes. Edith.

1065
01:23:59,102 --> 01:24:03,545
Yes, well, I have asked her to marry me,

1066
01:24:03,861 --> 01:24:05,089
and she has accepted.

1067
01:24:08,628 --> 01:24:11,945
Ah. Doctor Hahn, congratulations.

1068
01:24:14,189 --> 01:24:19,115
Yes, well, I wanted you
to be the first to know.

1069
01:24:19,778 --> 01:24:22,959
I'm very pleased for you,

1070
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:25,960
very pleased.

1071
01:24:35,283 --> 01:24:39,009
Lise Meitner was warm hearted
by nature, she had many friends,

1072
01:24:39,610 --> 01:24:43,006
and she may have wanted to have
a closer relationship with Otto.

1073
01:24:44,166 --> 01:24:50,149
But it really does seem that physics was
Lise's first love, maybe even her passion.

1074
01:24:53,433 --> 01:24:57,277
The 1920s and '30s were the
golden age of nuclear research.

1075
01:24:57,824 --> 01:25:01,267
The largest known nucleus at the time
was that of the Uranium atom

1076
01:25:01,799 --> 01:25:04,907
containing 238 protons and neutrons.

1077
01:25:05,870 --> 01:25:09,649
Meitner and Hahn were leading the race
to see if even bigger nuclei

1078
01:25:10,037 --> 01:25:12,841
could be created by adding more neutrons.

1079
01:25:14,924 --> 01:25:18,855
The nucleus is our focus.
The nucleus, made up of

1080
01:25:18,906 --> 01:25:22,906
protons and neutrons.

1081
01:25:23,871 --> 01:25:28,292
Now, the largest nucleus that we know
is that of the Uranium atom.

1082
01:25:29,126 --> 01:25:32,956
Its nucleus is a tightly
packed structure of

1083
01:25:33,197 --> 01:25:36,957
238 protons and neutrons.

1084
01:25:38,468 --> 01:25:43,313
The thrust of our work
is to try to fire

1085
01:25:43,414 --> 01:25:47,314
neutrons into
this huge structure,

1086
01:25:47,870 --> 01:25:52,416
and if we can get a neutron
to stick in here,

1087
01:25:53,139 --> 01:25:55,752
it will be a breakthrough.

1088
01:26:04,928 --> 01:26:07,453
Meitner may have been on
the brink of a major discovery,

1089
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:11,371
but Germany in the 1930s
was a dangerous place to be,

1090
01:26:11,981 --> 01:26:14,009
even for a world-class scientist.

1091
01:26:17,052 --> 01:26:18,784
The Jewess endangers our Institute.

1092
01:26:29,081 --> 01:26:34,446
Unlike many other jewish scientists, Meitner
refused to leave her work.

1093
01:26:34,643 --> 01:26:38,338
By 1938, her situation had become untenable.

1094
01:26:39,304 --> 01:26:41,301
The pressure on them all was unbearable.

1095
01:26:43,022 --> 01:26:45,522
Hahn, who was known for its anti-nazi views,

1096
01:26:46,101 --> 01:26:47,097
did his best to protect her.

1097
01:26:47,924 --> 01:26:49,474
At least, initially.

1098
01:26:50,604 --> 01:26:53,570
I need to talk to you about Lise.
Ah, not now, I'm too busy.

1099
01:26:53,869 --> 01:26:55,148
We have to protect her.

1100
01:26:57,725 --> 01:27:00,618
Oh...
How? What can we do?

1101
01:27:01,395 --> 01:27:04,256
The situation is the way it is.
Who knows what could happen next?

1102
01:27:05,055 --> 01:27:08,388
She can't stay. Its just not tenable.

1103
01:27:08,658 --> 01:27:11,071
But she hasn't got a visa
or even a valid passport.

1104
01:27:11,538 --> 01:27:13,462
And she may soon be forbidden
to leave Germany.

1105
01:27:17,025 --> 01:27:19,685
We can't harbor a Jew.

1106
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:23,115
If she stays, the regime will
shut us all down.

1107
01:27:33,016 --> 01:27:35,242
Lise!

1108
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:42,888
Horlein demands that you leave.

1109
01:27:44,542 --> 01:27:46,420
You can't throw her out.

1110
01:27:50,614 --> 01:27:53,227
Horlein says you should not come
into the Institute any more.

1111
01:28:01,530 --> 01:28:05,150
When it became clear that Meitner would
be dismissed and probably arrested,

1112
01:28:05,617 --> 01:28:10,309
physicists all around Europe desperately
wrote letters inviting her to conferences,

1113
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:13,154
to give her an excuse to leave Germany.

1114
01:28:13,291 --> 01:28:16,051
The Nazis refused her permission.

1115
01:28:17,432 --> 01:28:20,795
In July of 1938, a friend, a Dutch colleague

1116
01:28:21,264 --> 01:28:25,347
traveled to Berlin and illegally took Lise
back with him on a train to Holland.

1117
01:28:26,402 --> 01:28:30,630
The trip was so frightening that
at one point she begged to go back.

1118
01:28:31,257 --> 01:28:33,714
Despite the great danger,
she got through.

1119
01:28:41,936 --> 01:28:46,140
She had lost everything: her home,
her position, her books,

1120
01:28:46,583 --> 01:28:50,410
her salary, her pension,
even her native language.

1121
01:28:52,989 --> 01:28:56,081
She had been cut off from her work just
at the time when she was leading the field

1122
01:28:56,797 --> 01:29:00,224
and was on the brink of
a major scientific discovery.

1123
01:29:03,544 --> 01:29:05,946
No matter the privations she suffered,

1124
01:29:06,396 --> 01:29:08,217
Lise was still thinking of physics.

1125
01:29:08,915 --> 01:29:12,513
Amazingly she and Hahn were
able to collaborate by letter.

1126
01:29:14,498 --> 01:29:17,758
I hope, my dear Otto, that
after 30 years of work together

1127
01:29:17,833 --> 01:29:22,261
and friendship in the institute,
that at least the possibility remains

1128
01:29:22,293 --> 01:29:25,892
that you tell me as much as you can
about what is happening back there.

1129
01:29:46,110 --> 01:29:48,845
Lise was invited by an old student
friend to spend Christmas

1130
01:29:48,946 --> 01:29:51,846
on the west coast of Sweden.

1131
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:55,852
Her nephew, Otto Robert Frisch,
who was also a physicist,

1132
01:29:56,231 --> 01:29:57,635
came to join her there.

1133
01:29:58,128 --> 01:30:03,444
Aunt? Aunt?

1134
01:30:04,392 --> 01:30:07,559
Aunt? Lise?
How are you, my dear?

1135
01:30:11,110 --> 01:30:12,643
Merry Christmas?
Aunt?

1136
01:30:13,572 --> 01:30:16,913
I need your help,
come on let's go out.

1137
01:30:18,442 --> 01:30:19,959
But, I was hoping
you'd help me.

1138
01:30:23,669 --> 01:30:26,530
Back in Berlin, Hahn was getting
strange results.

1139
01:30:27,123 --> 01:30:30,956
He found no evidence to suggest that
bombarding the uranium nucleus with neutrons

1140
01:30:30,996 --> 01:30:34,113
had caused it to increase in size.

1141
01:30:35,154 --> 01:30:39,006
In fact, his experiments seemed
to be contaminated with radium,

1142
01:30:39,513 --> 01:30:40,856
a smaller atom.

1143
01:30:41,562 --> 01:30:44,315
He desperately needed Meitner's
expert analysis.

1144
01:30:44,921 --> 01:30:48,834
From afar, she was starting to suspect
that something very different

1145
01:30:48,935 --> 01:30:50,835
was happening in their experiment.

1146
01:30:53,609 --> 01:30:57,271
Hahn and Strassman are getting some
strange results with the uranium work.

1147
01:30:57,304 --> 01:30:58,258
Really?

1148
01:30:58,335 --> 01:31:01,324
A couple of months ago
Hahn told me that

1149
01:31:01,425 --> 01:31:04,325
they were finding radium amongst
the uranium products.

1150
01:31:04,717 --> 01:31:07,291
We are looking for a much bigger element,

1151
01:31:07,298 --> 01:31:09,755
and here we are finding
something much smaller.

1152
01:31:10,581 --> 01:31:14,322
I urged Hahn to check again,
it couldn't be radium.

1153
01:31:15,276 --> 01:31:19,320
And now he writes to me and tells me
that it's not radium, it's barium.

1154
01:31:20,154 --> 01:31:21,639
But that's even smaller.

1155
01:31:22,211 --> 01:31:24,062
Exactly.

1156
01:31:24,434 --> 01:31:26,727
Hahn is sure that it's another error,
but I don't know any more.

1157
01:31:27,561 --> 01:31:30,030
It is at least possible that
barium is being produced.

1158
01:31:30,466 --> 01:31:32,142
So Hahn still needs you
to interpret the data.

1159
01:31:33,008 --> 01:31:35,234
It is my work too, you know.

1160
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:37,586
Exactly.

1161
01:31:38,420 --> 01:31:41,240
Well, I can't be there, can I?

1162
01:31:42,989 --> 01:31:44,800
Come on, let's walk.

1163
01:31:54,211 --> 01:31:55,751
Surely, he's made a mistake, hasn't he?

1164
01:31:56,179 --> 01:31:57,440
He hasn't done what you told him to.

1165
01:31:58,163 --> 01:32:00,879
My darling, Robert, he may not be
a brilliant theorist,

1166
01:32:01,194 --> 01:32:04,591
but he's too good a chemist
to get this wrong.

1167
01:32:11,491 --> 01:32:14,960
If you imagine a drop of water,
a big drop, it's unstable,

1168
01:32:15,450 --> 01:32:16,926
on the verge of breaking apart.

1169
01:32:18,272 --> 01:32:21,350
It turns out that a big nucleus
like uranium is just like that.

1170
01:32:22,209 --> 01:32:25,525
Now for four years Meitner
and Hahn and all other physicists

1171
01:32:26,247 --> 01:32:29,148
had thought that if you pump
more neutrons into this nucleus,

1172
01:32:29,575 --> 01:32:31,299
it'll just get bigger and heavier.

1173
01:32:35,382 --> 01:32:38,481
But suddenly Meitner and Frisch,
out in the midday snow,

1174
01:32:39,149 --> 01:32:41,437
realized that this nucleus
might just get so big

1175
01:32:41,853 --> 01:32:43,409
that it would split in two.

1176
01:32:50,451 --> 01:32:54,322
If the nucleus is so big that it has trouble
staying together, then couldn't just

1177
01:32:54,486 --> 01:32:57,850
a little tiny jog from a neutron and...

1178
01:32:57,907 --> 01:33:02,322
Yes, but if the nucleus did split,
the two halves would fly apart

1179
01:33:02,323 --> 01:33:03,123
with a huge amount of energy.

1180
01:33:03,324 --> 01:33:05,026
Where's that energy going to come from?

1181
01:33:06,019 --> 01:33:07,476
How much energy?

1182
01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:10,751
Well, we worked out that
the mutual repulsion between two nuclei

1183
01:33:10,852 --> 01:33:13,752
would generate about
200 million electron volts.

1184
01:33:13,938 --> 01:33:15,936
But something has to supply that energy.

1185
01:33:16,322 --> 01:33:19,235
Wait, let me do a packing
fraction calculation.

1186
01:33:27,249 --> 01:33:31,784
The two nuclei are lighter than
the original nucleus of the uranium

1187
01:33:32,377 --> 01:33:34,695
by about one-fifth of a proton in mass.

1188
01:33:35,669 --> 01:33:38,478
What? So some mass has been lost?

1189
01:33:39,592 --> 01:33:41,996
Einstein's E = mc2?

1190
01:33:44,184 --> 01:33:48,675
If we multiply the lost mass by
the speed of light squared we get...

1191
01:33:54,325 --> 01:33:57,850
200 million electron volts.

1192
01:33:58,429 --> 01:34:00,328
He's split the atom.

1193
01:34:01,468 --> 01:34:04,560
No, no, no.
You've split the atom.

1194
01:34:12,803 --> 01:34:14,416
It was an amazing discovery.

1195
01:34:15,890 --> 01:34:18,983
Of course in the laboratory we are
talking about tiny amounts of uranium

1196
01:34:19,547 --> 01:34:21,942
and correspondingly tiny amounts of energy.

1197
01:34:22,522 --> 01:34:25,996
But the point is that the amount
of energy released was relatively large

1198
01:34:26,329 --> 01:34:29,645
and that came from the mass
of the uranium itself.

1199
01:34:30,833 --> 01:34:34,932
The energy released was entirely
consistent with Einstein's equation,

1200
01:34:35,389 --> 01:34:37,516
E=mc2.

1201
01:34:41,855 --> 01:34:45,715
Meitner and Frisch published the discovery
of what they called nuclear fission

1202
01:34:45,788 --> 01:34:48,929
to great acclaim.
But betrayal awaited them.

1203
01:34:50,118 --> 01:34:53,056
Otto Hahn was under pressure
from the Nazi regime

1204
01:34:53,157 --> 01:34:55,957
to write his Jewish colleague
out of the story.

1205
01:34:56,011 --> 01:34:59,945
He alone was awarded the 1944
Nobel Prize for the discovery.

1206
01:35:00,555 --> 01:35:03,601
In his speech he barely mentioned
the leading role of Meitner.

1207
01:35:04,962 --> 01:35:06,646
Bizarrely even after the war,

1208
01:35:07,178 --> 01:35:09,544
Hahn maintained it was he and not Meitner

1209
01:35:09,914 --> 01:35:12,047
who had discovered nuclear fission.

1210
01:35:15,098 --> 01:35:17,504
Lise Meitner was betrayed,

1211
01:35:17,848 --> 01:35:19,551
refused a Nobel prize she deserved,

1212
01:35:20,458 --> 01:35:23,134
but her work was to have
a far greater legacy.

1213
01:35:23,825 --> 01:35:25,966
With E=mc2

1214
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,740
she may have only broken apart
only a handful of atoms,

1215
01:35:29,175 --> 01:35:32,125
but the genie was out of the bottle.

1216
01:35:49,311 --> 01:35:52,783
Lise Meitner had shown that Einstein's E=mc2

1217
01:35:53,366 --> 01:35:56,460
was true, energy could be
released from matter.

1218
01:35:57,338 --> 01:36:00,046
But neighter of this pure scientists
had foreseen

1219
01:36:00,147 --> 01:36:02,847
the consequences of their discoveries.

1220
01:36:02,888 --> 01:36:06,966
In 1942, an intense effort to build
an atom bomb was begun.

1221
01:36:07,503 --> 01:36:11,368
All over America, secret installations
sprang up under the code name

1222
01:36:11,842 --> 01:36:13,574
"The Manhattan Project".

1223
01:36:13,962 --> 01:36:16,087
Meitner was asked to join the
Manhattan project, and she refused.

1224
01:36:16,465 --> 01:36:18,520
She refused to have anything to do
with the atomicic bomb.

1225
01:36:20,179 --> 01:36:23,680
But Robert Frisch was different.
He was an important member of the team,

1226
01:36:23,711 --> 01:36:26,608
because he was convinced of the need
to beat the Nazis in a nuclear arms race.

1227
01:36:47,224 --> 01:36:50,984
The atomic bombs dropped on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki

1228
01:36:51,367 --> 01:36:55,653
demonstrated the terrible destructive power
of E = mc2.

1229
01:37:11,325 --> 01:37:14,506
A few pounds of uranium and
plutonium were detonated,

1230
01:37:14,995 --> 01:37:18,776
splitting apart their atoms and
releasing vast amounts of energy.

1231
01:37:28,614 --> 01:37:31,988
While the pure inquisitiveness of the
world's most gifted scientists

1232
01:37:32,445 --> 01:37:35,410
ironically had brought humanity
a weapon of mass destruction,

1233
01:37:36,157 --> 01:37:39,337
the equation is now used to ask
the biggest question of all:

1234
01:37:40,156 --> 01:37:41,296
Where did we come from?

1235
01:37:59,739 --> 01:38:04,557
Today's generation of physicists see
E=mc2 in action every day.

1236
01:38:07,061 --> 01:38:08,795
In huge accelerators like this

1237
01:38:09,246 --> 01:38:12,010
atomic particles are fired at
almost the speed of light.

1238
01:38:18,935 --> 01:38:21,725
As they travel more and more
energy is pumped into them.

1239
01:38:22,751 --> 01:38:26,187
Just as Einstein predicted,
they grow in mass.

1240
01:38:28,083 --> 01:38:32,373
These are the exact conditions
that existed just after the Big Bang.

1241
01:38:33,528 --> 01:38:36,431
E = mc2 actually tells us how
the Big Bang itself happened.

1242
01:38:41,539 --> 01:38:43,154
In the first moments of
creation, the universe

1243
01:38:43,594 --> 01:38:47,280
was this immensely dense, immensely
concentrated eruption of energy.

1244
01:38:47,873 --> 01:38:51,167
As it rushed apart and expanded,
huge amounts of energy or "E"

1245
01:38:51,609 --> 01:38:53,161
were converted into mass or "M".

1246
01:38:53,613 --> 01:38:56,438
Pure energy became matter,
it became the particles and atoms,

1247
01:38:56,808 --> 01:38:58,557
and it eventually formed the first stars.

1248
01:39:03,878 --> 01:39:08,160
Our sun is a huge furnace, floating in
space, and it's powered by E = mc2.

1249
01:39:09,877 --> 01:39:15,555
Now it turns out, every second, four million
tons of solid mass of the sun, disappears.

1250
01:39:16,205 --> 01:39:18,537
It comes out as energy. Not just a little
bit of energy,

1251
01:39:18,598 --> 01:39:20,838
it's enough to light up
our entire solar system,

1252
01:39:20,908 --> 01:39:23,202
make the solar
system glow with heat and light.

1253
01:39:25,487 --> 01:39:29,995
And not only do stars emit energy,
in accordance with E = mc2,

1254
01:39:30,492 --> 01:39:35,041
the whole process
actually creates life itself.

1255
01:39:36,951 --> 01:39:41,299
Eventually, a massive star dies,
the debris floats around,

1256
01:39:41,939 --> 01:39:47,254
clusters together, gets pulled into the
orbits of another star and becomes a planet.

1257
01:39:49,989 --> 01:39:53,892
We humans and the earth we stand on
are made of stardust;

1258
01:39:54,512 --> 01:39:58,910
we are a direct product of E = mc2.

1259
01:40:03,732 --> 01:40:06,339
Einstein built on the work of those
who went before him.

1260
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:09,767
Now others have taken his
equation on further.

1261
01:40:09,994 --> 01:40:15,103
E=mc2 is being used to delve
back into time, to figure out exactly

1262
01:40:15,190 --> 01:40:21,092
how our universe started and,
if in fact, it will one day end.

1263
01:40:27,675 --> 01:40:32,233
Somewhere out there is yet
another genius with the answer.
