1
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,260
I'm Boots Riley.

2
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,762
I'm the writer and director
of <i>Sorry To Bother You.</i>

3
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,980
Significant Productions.

4
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:24,192
That's Nina Yang Bongiovi
and Forest Whitaker.

5
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:27,528
MNM Creative.
They're money people.

6
00:00:27,612 --> 00:00:29,530
Macro.
You all know who Macro is.

7
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:30,740
Charles King and them.

8
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,993
Cinereach. They're really cool,

9
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:36,495
New Yorker, hipster film people.

10
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:38,372
The Space Program. Gus.

11
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,129
So this scene...

12
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:47,298
I knew...

13
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,550
This was the first scene I knew
that I had in the movie

14
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:54,055
because it is, uh, kind of based on

15
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:58,601
how my friend, Rob, always got his jobs.

16
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:02,230
But he never got caught, though.

17
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:04,357
And he would get some really cool jobs.

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,901
He actually got jobs at Bank of America,

19
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,403
like, you know, not even as a teller,

20
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:11,489
as like a, uh...

21
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:12,740
as a, uh...

22
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:15,451
<i>Bank of Oakland between 2014...</i>

23
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:20,248
An executive, by lying
and giving out phone numbers

24
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:23,376
that were supposedly to managers

25
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:25,378
of restaurants and stuff like that,

26
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:31,550
but were really to the busboys,
um, of restaurants, and, uh...

27
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:32,927
<i>That is intriguing.</i>

28
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:38,557
And just was really good
at lying to get jobs.

29
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:41,352
Um, so shout-out to Rob,

30
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,854
if you are watching this.

31
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:47,316
<i>And you, Mr. Green,
you never fucking worked there.</i>

32
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,278
<i>And the number that you gave
to the Rusty Scupper...</i>

33
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:52,780
This is a scene

34
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:56,617
that we actually did in the Sundance Labs.

35
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,288
You know, when you go
to the Sundance Director's Lab,

36
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:04,083
you get to try a few scenes.

37
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,127
And luckily, we got to work it out

38
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,089
because I had this crazy,
like, figure-eight idea,

39
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:13,634
like, to be like,
"I'm a new director on the scene.

40
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:16,053
Check out what I can do."

41
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:18,848
<i>Well, I had them made.</i>

42
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,725
<i>Listen, I just really...</i>

43
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,268
We worked out the scene there,

44
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:25,688
so I think that's one reason
why it works really well.

45
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:33,237
Robert Longstreet
is an amazing, crazy dude.

46
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:36,240
And the other crazy dude that you will see

47
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:39,827
throughout this whole movie
is Lakeith Stanfield.

48
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,787
Um, you see it in his eyes.

49
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:44,915
Not just that he's crazy,
but that he's vulnerable

50
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:48,836
and that he's open to what's happening.

51
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,340
And I needed someone like this
to take us on this journey.

52
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:54,592
<i>And you will show up tomorrow happy.</i>

53
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,178
<i>- Hmm?
- Thank you, uh, thank you.</i>

54
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,555
Robert Longstreet, I saw him

55
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:03,517
in a movie called
<i>Thou Wast Mild and Lovely</i>

56
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:05,978
and just knew I had to have him.

57
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:07,563
<i>Stick to the script.</i>

58
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:10,149
<i>Stick to the script.
Stick to the script.</i>

59
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:13,903
And yeah, those are
those stupid slogans we see.

60
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,034
This font is created by J. Otto Seibold.

61
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:23,788
I had this font before
we even had the movie.

62
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,247
He's a good friend of mine.

63
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,291
<i>Detroit.</i>

64
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:31,045
That's Tessa Thompson.
That's Lakeith Stanfield.

65
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:32,963
Tessa Thompson.

66
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,090
<i>Detroit?</i>

67
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:37,426
Watch this. Lakeith Stanfield.
See how that works?

68
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,510
And...

69
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:41,865
<i>You ever think about dying?</i>

70
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,891
I'm not gonna tell you who that is.

71
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,851
And this...

72
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:52,525
Although, the actor
in the picture is Keba Konte

73
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:56,362
who took The Coup's
first publicity photos.

74
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,156
<i>When we're old, like, 90.</i>

75
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:05,454
I really needed this to be a movie

76
00:04:05,538 --> 00:04:11,585
that, uh, we highlighted
the humanity in the characters.

77
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:16,465
And for me, one missing part
of the humanity in characters,

78
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:21,137
um, especially when people
of color are portrayed,

79
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:27,726
is, um, they're the idea of, um,

80
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:34,066
them thinking of themselves
in the context of the world,

81
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,026
in the context of time and space.

82
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,987
<i>You will always matter. Okay?</i>

83
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,239
You know, something that people would call

84
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:45,411
you know, "having an existential crisis"
in his case.

85
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:48,205
But I thought that it made him more human.

86
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,749
This room, um...

87
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:55,463
Actually, I'd seen a picture
of Bob Marley's room

88
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:57,214
on a documentary,

89
00:04:57,298 --> 00:05:00,092
and I took a screenshot of that picture,

90
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:02,386
and it was like, this is Cassius's room.

91
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,181
And it really represents
the beautiful clutter

92
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:07,349
we were trying to get
with this whole movie.

93
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:13,314
Production designer Jason Kisvarday

94
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,316
really did a great job.

95
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,235
That's my boy Tyranny's house,

96
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,196
right around the corner from my house.

97
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,656
I just knocked on his door
and said, "We need your house."

98
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,658
He said it was cool.

99
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:29,580
We, uh, got his wife
a couple days at a spa,

100
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:30,789
and it was all good.

101
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,376
<i>I have to go to work, anyway.</i>

102
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,380
All of these fliers and pictures,

103
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,758
they're all stuff
that means stuff to people,

104
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,677
and I think that's why this works.

105
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,013
<i>You could try part-time.</i>

106
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,576
<i>Everyone is talking...</i>

107
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,560
That's actually a picture from...

108
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:53,747
<i>WorryFree is the
revolutionary new business...</i>

109
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,898
A prison that was made into a hotel

110
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,067
in the Netherlands.

111
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,836
<i>Your guaranteed employment</i>

112
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,445
<i>and housing for life.</i>

113
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:04,031
<i>Stop worrying and get WorryFree!</i>

114
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,533
<i>The WorryFree living quarters...</i>

115
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:06,825
WorryFree.

116
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,345
<i>The WorryFree food is to die for.</i>

117
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:11,539
It's a program, takes care
of all your needs, right?

118
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:14,041
<i>Cash, baby,
what are they paying you?</i>

119
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,003
<i>I think it's just commission.</i>

120
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:18,963
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

121
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,257
This was actually like
the first or second scene

122
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,758
that we shot in the movie...

123
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:23,968
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

124
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,636
And the chemistry

125
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,139
between Lakeith and Tessa is awesome.

126
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,391
<i>Nice earrings.</i>

127
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,521
Also designed by J. Otto Seibold.

128
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,401
So this is a great scene,
uh, for two reasons.

129
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:45,990
One, Terry Crews, uh, is
somewhat of a reveal

130
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,825
unless you've seen the trailer.

131
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:53,038
Um, and then, two,
Terry Crews is an awesome actor.

132
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:56,375
And then, watch this, what Lakeith does,
right here with his finger.

133
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,836
He should be pointing at Terry,

134
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,922
but instead, he bends his finger slightly.

135
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:04,383
And that's just one of the little details

136
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,970
that make us feel Cassius as a person,

137
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,096
as a human being.

138
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,515
Terry Crews is someone who,

139
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,436
he... he is a very inspiring guy.

140
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,979
He's very full of life.

141
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,899
He got behind this project
when he really didn't have to

142
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:24,069
and, um, came and gave it his full force,

143
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:29,074
gave a lot of energy
and brought Sergio to life.

144
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,539
This car is definitely based
on one of The Coup's songs,

145
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,585
uh, "My Car Is Better Than Your Shoes,"

146
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:43,005
but it's also just based on a lot of cars
that I've had in my life.

147
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,635
<i>Hi. Forty on two.</i>

148
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,017
Yeah, a lot of people thought
I should cut this scene out.

149
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,570
Those are homeless camps in Oakland.

150
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,447
We didn't have to build those.

151
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,327
We had fun making those billboards.

152
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,081
Got two of my kids in that,
two of my nephews.

153
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:20,668
Uh, football team, a fun, fun bunch.

154
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,299
Various shots riding around
West Oakland and downtown.

155
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:53,242
This... It was hard on this day
building that lobby.

156
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:56,078
Um, we only had one side
of it ready at one time,

157
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,747
and so we could only shoot
in one direction at a time.

158
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:03,001
<i>Make sure that thousands of calls
can go out and in at the same time.</i>

159
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:06,296
This was
just straight built out of nothing,

160
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,592
and, uh, Jason Kisvarday and crew...

161
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:12,511
which, that is Jason Kisvarday.

162
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:16,181
Hal Jameson is our production
designer Jason Kisvarday.

163
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:17,433
And, um...

164
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,979
they really outdid themselves.

165
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:27,276
We worked from pictures
of the cubicles in <i>Tron.</i>

166
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:30,237
This is closest we could get
with the space that we had.

167
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,283
<i>You might even be able
to be a Power Caller.</i>

168
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:35,617
<i>A Power Caller?</i>

169
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,911
This guy, Michael X. Sommers,

170
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:41,206
he, uh, actually lived
only a few blocks away

171
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,959
from where we were shooting,
so he's technically a local hire.

172
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,170
But I have a feeling that by the time

173
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,630
you guys see this DVD,

174
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:52,551
he will be known way more than locally.

175
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:57,473
He really brought a cool energy to this.

176
00:09:57,556 --> 00:10:01,351
Again... picture of someone.

177
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,981
And I really wanted to...

178
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:11,695
be able to show an emotion.

179
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,906
I wanted to take the audience through

180
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,283
the same emotions
that Cassius is going through.

181
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,869
And I figured that if I did it visually,

182
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:23,207
we wouldn't just be understanding
what emotions he's having.

183
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,542
We'd feel it with him.

184
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,004
Again, the papers in the background...

185
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:31,673
<i>Hello?</i>

186
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:34,134
Well, not again.
The papers in the background

187
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:36,762
are ones that, uh...

188
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,140
I wanted to use to...

189
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,144
make us feel the frustration

190
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:46,939
that's happening in Cassius and, uh...

191
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,357
<i>Hi, Mrs. Costello.</i>

192
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,317
I think I got a lot of that idea

193
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,529
from, like, Emir Kusturica films

194
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,614
where they'll have, like,

195
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,867
just a whole flock of geese going by,

196
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:02,162
filling up the whole frame,
out of nowhere,

197
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:05,123
and kind of adding to the chaos and...

198
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:08,877
So, all of this is this beautiful clutter

199
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,004
from just...

200
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:13,715
these pictures,
which is our neighbor's house,

201
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:17,594
and then, um, to stuff that we created.

202
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:26,854
The chaos that's happening
not only in the story,

203
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:30,774
but visually,
with the production design.

204
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:32,818
<i>Damn it.</i>

205
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:39,825
And in Cassius's mind and face,

206
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,369
and those papers add a lot to it.

207
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,746
This cut is something I figured out

208
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,040
right then when we were shooting
that scene was,

209
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,418
I figured out that we could do that

210
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:54,089
with him, um, saying,
"You're gonna just eat all those fries."

211
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:57,092
So, we changed
this scene later to fit it.

212
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:01,680
<i>Hey. That's that dude from that show.</i>

213
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:02,764
<i>Hey!</i>

214
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:04,558
<i>- Oh, shit!
- Hey!</i>

215
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,518
<i>That's fucking cool.
I hate that show.</i>

216
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:11,231
<i>But I never noticed that room.
What is that?</i>

217
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:15,444
Yeah, this is
the first time we really get to...

218
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,779
we... we start to meet Sal.

219
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,075
And that's... Jermaine Fowler,

220
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:26,496
an amazing comedian who, uh...

221
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,916
This was his first movie,

222
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:31,752
and he really killed it on this.

223
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,048
The VIP room.

224
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:41,094
Um, I described it in the script
as ten-by-ten

225
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:44,431
and didn't realize
till it was time to shoot it

226
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:45,849
that ten-by-ten was too big.

227
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,477
This was supposed to be
a much smaller thing.

228
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,896
So, as soon as he stepped in,

229
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,066
we should've seen how small it was.

230
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,110
But we made the scene work anyway.

231
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,907
<i>That's some baller shit.</i>

232
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,332
<i>Hey, Mr. D. Imits.</i>

233
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,668
<i>Cassius Green here.
Sorry to bother you...</i>

234
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:15,045
Really grateful to have worked

235
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,798
with Danny Glover on this.

236
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,592
Danny Glover and my father...

237
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:22,260
<i>Hey, youngblood.</i>

238
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:26,264
Actually, uh, went
to San Francisco State together.

239
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:32,354
They were part of the 1968 student strike
at San Francisco State

240
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:36,441
that created the first, uh, school

241
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:40,654
or department of ethnic studies
in the United States.

242
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:47,995
So, I have been knowing Danny the longest
out of all of the cast.

243
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,205
<i>I'm just trying to give you some game.</i>

244
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,790
<i>You wanna make some money here?</i>

245
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:55,002
He really,
like everyone on here,

246
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:57,462
came and took it seriously,

247
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,881
and I think, um...

248
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,426
<i>Well, you don't talk white enough.</i>

249
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,011
It really, uh...

250
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,598
I can't speak for Lakeith,
but I've heard him say

251
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:13,228
that he was really in awe of Danny
as he was working with him.

252
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,399
This scene is
really interesting because...

253
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:23,321
when I wrote the monologue
that Danny is saying here,

254
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,532
I had no idea that I would take it

255
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,868
to the point of it being

256
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,786
an overdubbed white voice.

257
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:36,251
Only when I... after I wrote it
that I realized that's where it had to go.

258
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,088
<i>You've never been fired.</i>

259
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:41,423
<i>Only laid off.</i>

260
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,052
<i>It's not really a white voice.</i>

261
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:47,971
<i>It's what they wish they sounded like.</i>

262
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,766
<i>So it's like what they think...</i>

263
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:55,395
It was better, you know,
for me to bend a reality

264
00:14:56,688 --> 00:15:00,192
to put my ideas of contextualizing
what was happening...

265
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:06,782
than to have it be explained.

266
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:10,035
And so that's how I started
going down the rabbit hole

267
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:13,622
of this being this fantastical,
absurdist movie.

268
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,166
'Cause I didn't know that
that's what it was gonna be

269
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,876
when I started out writing it.

270
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:21,755
<i>You drop that shit,
'cause it crossed the line.</i>

271
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:25,425
And we all have been
through stuff like this,

272
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:29,971
these bullshit pep talks
where someone's...

273
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:37,104
They're trying to get you excited about...

274
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:39,981
making them money.

275
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:44,069
<i>But instead, you drag that heavy...</i>

276
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,779
And there's always bad pizza.

277
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:49,074
<i>- And then you tag it.
- Okay.</i>

278
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,575
<i>I-I just...</i>

279
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,411
<i>I feel like these metaphors
have not been cleared for this.</i>

280
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:54,955
Now, this is Kate Berlant.

281
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:59,126
I had been wanting to work with her
for a while as I was writing it.

282
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,837
I didn't really know what she would do,

283
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,550
but, um, this is kind of really...

284
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:10,011
this character is kind of really
in the wheelhouse

285
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,806
where I knew that she could kill it.

286
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:18,019
There was a point where
we were going to have to hire

287
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:21,314
a local actor for this
instead of bringing her in,

288
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:22,983
and I was just like, "I will..."

289
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:27,404
"I will bring her in myself
because she's amazing."

290
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:31,324
And, um... so, certain part
of this was written,

291
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,743
but the funny stuff like
what she's doing right now

292
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,830
with her hands,
that's... that's just her.

293
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:40,584
And, uh, she is, uh...

294
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,335
<i>"No."</i>

295
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,855
You got to check out her stuff.

296
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:47,382
Just look up Kate Berlant,
and you'll never go back.

297
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:50,135
Once you go Kate,
you'll never go straight.

298
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,721
<i>Digital, paper, otherwise.</i>

299
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,306
<i>Media is changing, so is capital.</i>

300
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,742
<i>Get with it. I don't want to scare you,
but it's a new world.</i>

301
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,311
<i>Okay, team members, let's, uh...</i>

302
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:02,022
<i>Thank you very much,
and let's all get back to work.</i>

303
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:06,568
And obviously, we're doing...

304
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,029
we're showing Steven Yeun, so...

305
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,990
um, most people will be like,
"Oh, they're showing Steven Yeun,

306
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,868
so he must be a character
in this movie."

307
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,953
Um, and he is.

308
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,666
He is, um...

309
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:25,712
Squeeze,

310
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:29,299
someone who would be known as a "salt."

311
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:35,180
And a salt is someone
who gets a job at a place, uh,

312
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:40,393
with the purpose
of organizing the workers.

313
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,940
And, uh, Steven talked
to a number of folks

314
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:49,736
who had experience salting
in order to create this character.

315
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,696
<i>People call me Cash.</i>

316
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,500
<i>It was a really good question
in there, man.</i>

317
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:56,159
<i>What, about us getting paid?</i>

318
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:59,412
I really like
what he did with Squeeze.

319
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,807
<i>- I know, right?
- It's bullshit.</i>

320
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,042
<i>Exactly. I mean you just cut
straight to the chase, man.</i>

321
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:07,629
And that was improvised,
about the, uh, the machine,

322
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,422
about it not being free.

323
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:17,138
So, there's a lot of stuff in here
that was cool that we kept in

324
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:20,767
that happened before the dialogue
was supposed to start.

325
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,727
I like this thing that's about to happen.

326
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,312
<i>Your energy to jump things off.</i>

327
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:27,983
<i>Yeah, um, look.
I got to get back to work, man.</i>

328
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,234
<i>Hey, man, look...</i>

329
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,611
BOOTS
This, uh, reverse "that's all, folks."

330
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:32,988
See, I don't know the...

331
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,447
I don't know what the, uh...

332
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:36,574
<i>It's on me.</i>

333
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:40,495
That wipe,
I call it reverse "that's all, folks"

334
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:44,207
'cause I don't know real terminology.

335
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,501
That was the thing on the set.
I don't know the...

336
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,170
Even in music, I don't know
the real terminology.

337
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:52,215
I don't... I'm not gonna stuff my brain
with those words.

338
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,676
<i>Hey, lady, how much?</i>

339
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:59,973
That was Giant Burgers,
the sign she was in front of,

340
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:04,936
which is very much a Bay Area thing.

341
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,872
<i>- Who are you?
- That's Squeeze.</i>

342
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,065
<i>- Squeeze.
- He works with us at RegalView.</i>

343
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,275
<i>Squeeze, Detroit.</i>

344
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,777
<i>- Detroit? That's cool.
- Yeah.</i>

345
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:14,422
<i>My parents wanted me
to have an American...</i>

346
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:20,577
This is another, uh, scene
that we shot in the labs,

347
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:25,623
and so, I knew from the labs
that's something that I was...

348
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,128
concerned about
before we started shooting was

349
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,088
keeping the pacing right on this...

350
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:38,887
so that we felt a certain energy
happening in the car with them.

351
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:39,970
And...

352
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,224
once we started shooting,
I realized I had nothing

353
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,101
to worry about with this group of folks.

354
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,687
<i>Furniture store
and play football all day.</i>

355
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,522
That was a cheap joke right there,

356
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,900
but I think it worked
on a number of levels,

357
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,694
'cause we needed to see
those football players again.

358
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:57,697
<i>Baby, can we please not talk
about the sun exploding tonight?</i>

359
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,990
<i>Okay.</i>

360
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:07,123
And she switches it from one
Coup song from the soundtrack

361
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,726
to the other Coup song
from the soundtrack.

362
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,836
This is a world in which, um,

363
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,089
the whole world listens to this one album,

364
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,591
which is the soundtrack
to <i>Sorry To Bother You.</i>

365
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,760
<i>You can wipe my ass, Sal.</i>

366
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:19,969
<i>Oh, really?</i>

367
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:23,515
And that is
from a story from my mother.

368
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:26,935
She would tell me this story
about her and her boyfriend

369
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:30,772
taking these long trips,
and the windshield wipers didn't work,

370
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:35,110
and they didn't...
um, they used string.

371
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,987
Her boyfriend, which is
my older brother's father.

372
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:44,577
Boom. I've had this scene
happen in my life many times.

373
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:50,208
This is actually footage
from Occupy Oakland.

374
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,002
<i>WorryFree CEO Steve Lift</i>

375
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,921
<i>was interviewed on</i> Oprah <i>today.</i>

376
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,382
<i>No. Conclusively no.</i>

377
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,592
Steve Lift.
The sandals are important.

378
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:00,956
<i>Threats of physical violence,</i>

379
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,055
<i>so, therefore, the comparison
to slavery is just ludicrous...</i>

380
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:06,349
The wardrobe.

381
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:10,061
Very... Very cool,
very liberal wardrobe there.

382
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:17,235
Deirdra Govan, our illustrious
costume designer.

383
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:21,406
This is actually footage from Greece.

384
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,074
<i>There's no employment
for many people.</i>

385
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,701
<i>Even sweatshops
have been replaced...</i>

386
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:29,247
Cynthia Rose,
played by Indigo Jackson,

387
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,959
who is also the voice
you'll hear later on,

388
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,961
during the stop-motion animation.

389
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,757
People had to do double duty on that.

390
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:41,551
That's J. Otto Seibold, with the beard.

391
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,928
<i>In the sauce
with the cheese in it first,</i>

392
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:47,015
<i>- that's some white shit.
- That's some bullshit, man.</i>

393
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:48,892
That's Silk-E, with the head wrap.

394
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,727
She's in The Coup.

395
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,520
<i>That's how black folks do it, man.</i>

396
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:55,315
<i>- No, nigga, I'm black.
- We talked about that, man.</i>

397
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,198
<i>You're kind of black,
you Lionel Richie black.</i>

398
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,944
<i>Look, I make my noodles,</i>

399
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,155
<i>and then I put the sauce on them,
then, look it...</i>

400
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,364
<i>Then, I put a little...</i>

401
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:07,911
Right here,
this bar is The Layover,

402
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:11,873
and the woman serving the drinks
at the beginning is Christi,

403
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,541
the owner of The Layover.

404
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,251
<i>Spaghetti's Chinese.</i>

405
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,879
<i>Speaking of white,
I wanna make a toast.</i>

406
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:20,840
In the background,
there's Lisa Aurora.

407
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:22,675
Many of you guys won't even know

408
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:25,136
these are just shout-outs
to people who are in there.

409
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,515
<i>To my esteemed
RegalView associates...</i>

410
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:33,520
We see some foreshadowing
of some Left Eye activists

411
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:36,105
in back of Detroit.

412
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:40,902
<i>I'd like to dedicate
this imbibing of intoxicating...</i>

413
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:45,406
This is also a scene
that we shot in the labs.

414
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:51,579
It was interesting.

415
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:53,623
We went through many ways

416
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:58,962
of figuring out how to do
the white voice, and, uh...

417
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,172
So, we did it different times
in different scenes.

418
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:05,218
Sometimes we had the actor

419
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:09,180
just mouth the words
without saying anything,

420
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:12,016
um, and have
someone off-screen read 'em.

421
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,434
<i>That's a scam.</i>

422
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:14,852
<i>- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

423
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:16,980
<i>If you work hard enough...</i>

424
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:20,817
Other times, we had them
actually just speak it

425
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,235
and then overdubbed it later.

426
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,072
And then sometimes
we had them mouth the words

427
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,991
without anyone reading it off-screen.

428
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:30,285
That was the hardest part to sync to.

429
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:31,953
<i>And the best word. "OFF."</i>

430
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,496
<i>It is the anchor to the slogan.</i>

431
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,707
<i>- So...
- So what's the point then?</i>

432
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,625
<i>What you think,
I'm just supposed to work,</i>

433
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:38,960
<i>eat, fuck, sleep?</i>

434
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,962
<i>No, I'm not saying that,
I'm saying...</i>

435
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,006
So this is Squeeze giving...

436
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:46,593
giving his opening salvo
to this group of folks.

437
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:48,011
<i>That way, we all get paid.</i>

438
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,722
Ostensibly,
he's been talking to other people

439
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:54,100
at the telemarketing spot before this.

440
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:57,228
Yeah, another reverse "that's all, folks."

441
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:02,066
I wanted it to feel like
a comic book, the way that it...

442
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,903
I don't know if that makes sense,
the pacing feeling like a comic book,

443
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:08,948
and the way... the different wipes

444
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:12,952
that we would've thought of as corny
just a couple years ago,

445
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,287
because they were.

446
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,788
Um, I wanted to use them.

447
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,248
<i>You should find a new place.</i>

448
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,127
That shirt that Tessa is wearing

449
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,130
is a shirt that was passed
from Joe Strummer

450
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,799
to Billy Bragg to me.

451
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,801
That's the green shirt.

452
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:31,512
And then the other shirt is...
you see what it says.

453
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:33,973
<i>He sent me a brochure.</i>

454
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,517
Originally,
that cross was something

455
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:39,020
that Sergio was supposed to be wearing.

456
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,397
But we... we only...

457
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,500
I only got to see it for
the first time on the day of,

458
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:47,111
and it was way too big, and it looked
clownish with him wearing it.

459
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:49,423
<i>You bring a chick
home to your apartment.</i>

460
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,366
<i>It's clean. It's stylish.</i>

461
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:52,450
<i>Of course it is...</i>

462
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:55,036
All right. Now we get to see

463
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,373
Cassius, like, getting into it.

464
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:00,583
Really, um...

465
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:04,754
<i>It's fuck time,
you know what I mean?</i>

466
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,589
Doing well

467
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,509
and starting to feel hisself.

468
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:12,053
<i>Spin Doctors. Classic!</i>

469
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:13,596
<i>Tim, I want to chop it up more,</i>

470
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,932
<i>but I got to get to my squash game.</i>

471
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,810
<i>Was that Visa or MasterCard?</i>

472
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:20,973
<i>God, this voice shit is crazy.</i>

473
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:27,360
I needed to show him
really enjoying his success.

474
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,487
And so, I think maybe we have

475
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:33,449
the first high-five montage
ever in cinema history.

476
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:41,207
And if not, it's the best
high-five montage in cinema history.

477
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:44,585
We had... This was so fun.

478
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:47,255
We wanted to keep shooting it,
but we had to keep moving.

479
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,760
Those two crazy dudes together,

480
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:57,473
they need to do a series
of movies, um, together.

481
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:11,070
The song playing under here
is The Coup's "O-Y-A-H-Y-T-T."

482
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:13,173
<i>You're doin' so fucking good
with the voice thing.</i>

483
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:16,492
We needed that happy feeling
in this movie right now.

484
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:19,370
We needed it because
there's a lot of crazy shit to come,

485
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:24,417
and we need to know
what Cassius is getting out of this

486
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,335
that's beyond just the money.

487
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:28,546
<i>Almost.</i>

488
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:32,633
<i>PC, baby. Power Caller.</i>

489
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,679
<i>No, uh...</i>

490
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,495
<i>- Did you hear what he just said?
- Yeah, yeah. I heard him, man.</i>

491
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,646
<i>He told me the exact same shit
three months ago.</i>

492
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:49,650
So this next thing is, uh,
very Edgar Wright-ish of me,

493
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:52,028
but I'm down to steal from people,

494
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,238
I don't care, to make a good movie.

495
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:59,202
That's iDummy,

496
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:02,955
a very well-known
turf dancer in the Bay Area.

497
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,628
There was a line that we had to cut out

498
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:13,257
where Cassius orders
a Long Island Iced Tea neat.

499
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:14,884
I wish we had the time for it.

500
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,136
Just imagine him
ordering that right there.

501
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,573
<i>They say 150 million people
watch this every night.</i>

502
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:21,724
<i>Mm. I personally...</i>

503
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:23,518
That game show...

504
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:27,730
is, uh...

505
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:33,444
I don't think it's impossible
to, uh, happen.

506
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,906
It's not that far off from what happens.

507
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:45,957
Right here...

508
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,210
<i>Mm-mm-mm-mm!</i>

509
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:53,506
I just wanted to...
Oh, yeah. This thing.

510
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:59,220
Yeah, I really have...

511
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:02,515
really want to talk about
what that is, but I don't.

512
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,244
<i>So, why you ain't dancing?</i>

513
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:07,061
Anyway, there are a lot of details

514
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:09,897
in this movie that, um...

515
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:17,238
have to do with, uh,
how mysterious life is,

516
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,115
and you don't always get the answers.

517
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,117
So, not gonna answer you about that.

518
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,493
Um...

519
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,582
Maybe it has something to do
with Danny Glover and who he is

520
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:29,709
and why he knows so much.

521
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:34,046
<i>They make a shit ton of money, man.</i>

522
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,132
So that line that he just said,

523
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,093
"I'm too old for this shit,"

524
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,012
I didn't even think about it

525
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:45,850
as being one of his classic
lines until I was in the edit.

526
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:51,981
Because I had that line there
before he was cast in the role.

527
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,608
<i>Apples to oranges.</i>

528
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:56,569
<i>More like apples and the Holocaust.</i>

529
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:01,489
<i>Alright, bye.</i>

530
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:06,787
This is one
of my favorite moments.

531
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:13,628
Just to shoot with all
the coordination that we did,

532
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:15,463
and all the pieces.

533
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:17,340
The smoke happening,

534
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:20,843
the tires, the sound of the bicycles,

535
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:23,095
the bicycles going past.

536
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,224
Football players there.

537
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:30,102
So all the elements just felt messy

538
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:33,064
in a way that I don't normally see.

539
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:35,566
And that was a big thing

540
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,985
that we were going for,
was some sort of mess.

541
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,656
And along with this moment with...

542
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:43,950
<i>- Who invited you?
- Who asked you?</i>

543
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:45,534
Cassius and Detroit.

544
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:47,846
<i>Pop up earlier, I thought
you were gonna come by.</i>

545
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,705
<i>Oh, to your gallery?</i>

546
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:53,626
The painting that you see
on a lot of...

547
00:29:56,462 --> 00:30:00,007
Detroit's clothing is by Omiroo,

548
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:02,009
who also did the artwork

549
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:05,554
that you see later in Detroit's...

550
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,182
<i>Can I get a light?</i>

551
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,184
What do you call it?
In her gallery.

552
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,548
<i>Those are nice earrings.</i>

553
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:14,397
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

554
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,916
<i>I didn't know you changed
your earrings.</i>

555
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,983
The earrings.

556
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:20,528
Um, the other earrings,
the costume designer made.

557
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:24,490
This earring, production design
department made it.

558
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,033
And, um...

559
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:30,830
That guy is actually
the guitar player in The Coup.

560
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,207
Grego Simmons.

561
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:48,097
One of our producers, Jonathan Duffy.

562
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:55,980
Waldenbooks in Oakland.

563
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:57,898
<i>Alright, everybody.</i>

564
00:30:57,982 --> 00:30:59,251
<i>This is a pretty
amazing turnout...</i>

565
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:05,322
This was the only homeless stuff
that we built,

566
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:07,658
was that part that exists right there.

567
00:31:07,742 --> 00:31:09,076
<i>Today is the warning shot.</i>

568
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,078
<i>Telling them that we stand united.</i>

569
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:12,621
This part came out really good

570
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:15,207
'cause we had... we had to be moved

571
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:17,793
from the other spot we were having.

572
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:21,797
We originally wanted to do...

573
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:22,882
<i>I'll give the call.</i>

574
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:25,509
I wanted to make it look like
N.W.A. on this,

575
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:27,678
like the album cover for N.W.A.

576
00:31:27,762 --> 00:31:32,433
So we beat from down below
looking at them up above.

577
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:35,686
And it didn't work out
because of where we had to be.

578
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:36,770
It just didn't look...

579
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:39,774
Compositionally,
there was nothing behind it.

580
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:41,692
There weren't the things.

581
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:46,363
So, we came up with this,
like, right before.

582
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:50,785
Which was these wipes.

583
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:52,787
<i>And they don't share.</i>

584
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,270
<i>If we're gonna give them our day...</i>

585
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:58,042
<i>we need to have enough
to cover our basic necessities.</i>

586
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,544
Fast pan the camera.

587
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:03,089
<i>Is anyone not down?</i>

588
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:05,341
Combined with wipes,

589
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:10,096
because we only shot
pieces of the crowd at once.

590
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:15,059
<i>Yeah. One for all, all for one.</i>

591
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,186
<i>Yeah! I brought all types of weapons.</i>

592
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,979
And that...

593
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:23,317
And that was...
That was, uh, Jermaine.

594
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,862
This was actually Jermaine
and Steven improvising.

595
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:31,408
People don't know that Steven, uh,
did improv early on.

596
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:38,082
This is something which is an homage

597
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:42,378
to a Paul Schrader movie,

598
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:45,631
or at least a shot in a Paul Schrader
movie called <i>Mishima.</i>

599
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:50,427
Um, there's a section called
"The Temple of the Golden Pavilion."

600
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:55,015
And I wanted that same feeling
for Cassius,

601
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:56,642
that same sense of awe.

602
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:02,272
Omari Hardwick.

603
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,203
<i>Thanks, Mr. Goldberg.</i>

604
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:10,406
<i>As always, we'll be getting that
out to you right away.</i>

605
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:11,782
<i>By the way...</i>

606
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:13,576
<i>RegalView management!</i>

607
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:18,247
This is, uh, time,

608
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,624
it's time for things to take off.

609
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:22,418
<i>We will not be overlooked!</i>

610
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:25,730
We had made that up.

611
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,339
It was supposed to be, originally,

612
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,758
like, him putting
the fingers to his head

613
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:32,261
like he was mimicking a phone call,

614
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,822
then putting it up and putting it down,

615
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,515
but the actions got too complicated.

616
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,059
<i>Fuck you!</i>

617
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:40,311
<i>Fuck you!</i>

618
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:41,896
<i>And fuck you!</i>

619
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,857
<i>Fuck you, RegalView!</i>

620
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,942
<i>Fuck you, RegalView!</i>

621
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:49,570
<i>Fuck you, RegalView!</i>

622
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:50,779
The crowd got...

623
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:54,533
The extras got really hyped
during this part and got out of control.

624
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:57,578
People started taking off
their headsets and throwing it.

625
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,955
It might not have been shots that we used,

626
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:03,417
but people forgot that this was...

627
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,002
They were making, uh...

628
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,714
They were making, you know,

629
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,800
everybody that was playing
management feel bad

630
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:15,679
because they were shooting
a lot of hate their way.

631
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,279
<i>Out, out, out, out, out.</i>

632
00:34:32,363 --> 00:34:34,090
Now, the production
design in this office,

633
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:36,617
I didn't talk about it,
but if you notice...

634
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:43,999
in the back of Cassius's head,
it goes from light to dark yellow,

635
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:47,962
and that is more noticeable earlier on.

636
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:51,590
<i>Pack up your shit and get out.</i>

637
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:55,970
<i>Well, fuck you and fuck you
and fuck you! Fuck you!</i>

638
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:58,722
I just realized there's a lot
of fuck-yous in this movie.

639
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:00,867
<i>Mr. Green, you're starting
to sound a little paranoid.</i>

640
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:03,644
That's cool. There's a lot
of fuck-yous in life.

641
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:05,062
<i>Great news.</i>

642
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,398
<i>Great motherfuckin' news.</i>

643
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:10,567
<i>Great motherfuckin' news.
Power Caller.</i>

644
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:12,879
<i>- What the fuck...
- Yeah, we just got the call.</i>

645
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:14,697
<i>They think you're A-1 material.</i>

646
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,198
This was a scene that...

647
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,951
<i>Yes, you are getting...</i>

648
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:21,161
Really got a lot of re-working...

649
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,291
as I was writing it.

650
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:26,374
Because...

651
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:28,419
<i>Young, strong,
intelligent power caller.</i>

652
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:29,795
We had to make...

653
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,172
I had to make you understand

654
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:35,050
why he might make the choices he does.

655
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:37,237
<i>All their issues are down here,
not up there.</i>

656
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:41,098
<i>Two very different kinds
of telemarketing.</i>

657
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,475
<i>Wait a minute, wait a minute,</i> uh...

658
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,436
And I think, uh,

659
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,247
what's interesting
about when you're writing,

660
00:35:47,271 --> 00:35:50,149
you're not thinking about how much
the actor will bring to it.

661
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:53,527
So a lot of the job was done
by Cassius...

662
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,945
I mean, by Lakeith.

663
00:35:56,864 --> 00:36:00,492
Yeah, I have a couple band members
in that group of football players.

664
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:04,538
<i>Maybe you're right.</i>

665
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,040
<i>The big money.</i>

666
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:09,543
<i>The top fucking tier of telemarketing.</i>

667
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:14,465
<i>Making history
with legends like Hal Jameson.</i>

668
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:15,799
<i>Badass!</i>

669
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:20,220
And everything in this
after the champagne pop...

670
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:21,764
<i>Oh! It's a really good batch.</i>

671
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,223
Is improvised.

672
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:25,351
A lot of times I just didn't yell "Cut!"

673
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,563
<i>- Just drink it right now?
- Yes!</i>

674
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,148
Just to see where it went.

675
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:32,751
Ninety percent of the time
it was something

676
00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:34,651
we didn't want to use, but...

677
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:37,529
here it gave us a moment

678
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:41,450
that we really needed in this film,

679
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,035
which is...

680
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,661
<i>Power Caller, baby!</i>

681
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:47,790
Right about...

682
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:50,167
<i>Power! Power caller!</i>

683
00:36:52,503 --> 00:36:55,005
All the improvising we did
on our other scenes

684
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:58,550
that we didn't use
paid off with having that moment.

685
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,348
<i>Wow, you really are ready, aren't you?</i>

686
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:08,102
<i>- Hey, Miss D. Yeah.
- Wow.</i>

687
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:11,522
<i>Okay. Well, let's do this, motherfucker.</i>

688
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:14,108
This scene was one
that we were re-writing

689
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:15,734
as we were shooting it.

690
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:19,279
Just trying different stuff,
and we got it down to something.

691
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:22,574
And this was something
where I just said,

692
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:24,952
"Compliment him on his pink shirt,

693
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:26,495
and give me a statistic about it."

694
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:30,165
<i>Thirty-five percent of men who wear pink
are more likely to start a franchise.</i>

695
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:34,044
And, uh, it is hi-larious.

696
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:36,130
<i>Wow. Damn.</i>

697
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:38,757
<i>- This is crazy.
- Oh! I'm sorry.</i>

698
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:44,388
The elevator was something
that went through many...

699
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:52,563
many different iterations on paper.

700
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:59,361
There was a version with a fireplace in it
and all that kind of stuff.

701
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:03,740
So we just had to have
the right balance of possible...

702
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:06,535
and impossible.

703
00:38:07,536 --> 00:38:08,996
Or possible and ridiculous.

704
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,418
<i>You need help or something?</i>

705
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,378
Like this, uh...

706
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:19,923
These, uh...

707
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:24,511
This code is one of those
ridiculous details

708
00:38:24,595 --> 00:38:27,514
that, I think, fill up our lives

709
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:32,227
and end up being funny in a way
that I'm not used to seeing.

710
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,772
Voice here is Rosario Dawson.

711
00:38:35,856 --> 00:38:37,876
<i>Place alongside legends
like Hal Jameson.</i>

712
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,613
She, uh, came on
after it was already done,

713
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:47,242
did this, and she's been a really big
promoter of this movie

714
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:48,911
even though this is all she did.

715
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:52,122
<i>All right. Does it do that every time?</i>

716
00:38:52,206 --> 00:38:55,209
<i>Welcome to the Power Calling
Suite, Mr. Green.</i>

717
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,128
<i>White voice at all times here.</i>

718
00:38:58,212 --> 00:39:00,881
<i>Yes, I, uh, almost forgot.</i>

719
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,344
Now, that,
those series of lights

720
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:09,264
is the reason why I was okay
with settling with this location.

721
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:12,809
This was another last-minute
location change,

722
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:14,770
and it really worked.

723
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:21,485
The look of, uh, mister...

724
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:25,989
whatever we want to call him,
Omari Hardwick's character...

725
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:29,219
<i>Who do you think,
Mr. Green, makes that call...</i>

726
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:31,078
Is something that was a series

727
00:39:31,161 --> 00:39:33,789
of back-and-forths and negotiations.

728
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:40,337
I found the eye patch and suggested it.

729
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,840
Deirdre Govan really wanted him
to have a bowler hat,

730
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,928
and I gave in on that.

731
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:51,139
And then at the last minute,
Omari was like,

732
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:54,810
"I wanna have sideburns like you have."

733
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,520
So I was like, "All right."

734
00:39:56,603 --> 00:40:00,357
So it came up with this look
that is really out there,

735
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,943
but I think we needed

736
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:09,616
this sort of a out-there guy
for Mr. Blank.

737
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,343
<i>Hey, what the fuck
are you doing?</i>

738
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:31,805
<i>Dave, stop him!</i>

739
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:35,767
That's Kelly Williams,
another one of the producers.

740
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:38,270
He fell. He didn't sue us.

741
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,981
<i>Left Eye, bitches!</i>

742
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:42,584
<i>WorryFree has resuscitated...</i>

743
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:46,945
So the WorryFree, uh,
production work space

744
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:51,742
is very much influenced
by Manufactured Landscapes,

745
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:55,162
the documentary
that beautifully shows, uh,

746
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:57,706
some terrible work spaces.

747
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,518
<i>Okay, but see,
I don't know if I can...</i>

748
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:02,586
<i>Ah! Sugar on top, white voice.</i>

749
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:05,422
<i>Yeah, but what I'm saying is, I don't know
if I'm gonna be able to...</i>

750
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:08,342
<i>Here's the starting salary.</i>

751
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:15,682
And again, this was
the other spot that...

752
00:41:15,766 --> 00:41:17,392
behind Cassius,

753
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:21,938
that made me be okay with using
the location we used.

754
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:25,150
Just this shot,
knowing we'd have that shot.

755
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,369
<i>Hey baby, what's your sign?</i>

756
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:37,204
<i>I haven't heard that one before.</i>

757
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:42,209
<i>Yo, that was crazy yesterday.</i>
<i>That was like that scene in</i> Norma Rae.

758
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:43,978
<i>You know the one
where she's like on the table?</i>

759
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:44,878
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

760
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:47,964
There's some beautiful, uh...

761
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,885
graffiti all throughout Oakland.

762
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,889
Beautiful artwork of all kinds.

763
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,477
You guys didn't know
that Steven Yeun could do this.

764
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:03,522
He trained for six months.

765
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:10,237
<i>Okay. Bravo.
Where'd you learn how to do that?</i>

766
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,448
No, that actually was a...

767
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:16,034
He's credited in the credits.
You can look him up.

768
00:42:16,118 --> 00:42:21,289
That was a...
the world champion sign twirler.

769
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,127
<i>Trouble's already there.
I just help folks fix it.</i>

770
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,672
<i>Yeah, that's what I do with my art too.</i>

771
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:32,926
Uh, what's happening here
is an important...

772
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:36,445
<i>I haven't seen your stuff, so I can't...</i>

773
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:40,308
Debate about art and organizing.

774
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:42,811
<i>So, how does it work with, uh...</i>

775
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:48,483
But it kind of got cut down,
um, into a couple of lines

776
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:52,821
because, you know,
what's more important

777
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:56,158
is people not getting, um,

778
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,786
bored of the scene and conversation.

779
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:05,542
So we made this into
a scene that really worked.

780
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:09,671
But if you read the script
that came out on McSweeney's,

781
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:13,216
you'll see there's a longer conversation

782
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,428
that maybe only artists
and organizers would care about.

783
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:21,641
So, I'm not talking to y'all, this movie.

784
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:25,937
I am, but you get it.

785
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,274
<i>You look like you're done here
if you need a ride.</i>

786
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:31,318
<i>No, Cash is on the way.</i>

787
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:32,527
<i>But thank you.</i>

788
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:41,453
<i>Nice work.</i>

789
00:43:44,206 --> 00:43:46,291
We filmed a lot of this movie...

790
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:51,838
in, like,
a two-mile radius of itself.

791
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:53,965
<i>Hey, girl!</i>

792
00:43:54,049 --> 00:44:00,096
So a lot of people that are from...
that really know Oakland might be like,

793
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,349
"Why is she getting in a car

794
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:05,977
to go over to where
her gallery spot is?"

795
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:10,941
Hal Jameson again.

796
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,445
I love this music that's right here.

797
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:18,949
The mus...
Let's talk about the music.

798
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:20,033
Um...

799
00:44:23,537 --> 00:44:29,668
The music is done by Tune-Yards
as far as the, uh, the score,

800
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:35,090
which is all the stuff
that the characters can't hear.

801
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:40,512
<i>You okay?</i>

802
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:43,932
Except for the one song,
"O-Y-A-H-Y-T-T."

803
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:49,396
And I worked with...

804
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:53,024
Merrill Garbus and Nate Brenner
of Tune-Yards

805
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:56,903
since before I was in the labs,

806
00:44:56,987 --> 00:44:58,446
before I was in the director's lab.

807
00:44:59,114 --> 00:45:01,032
<i>Does that mean you can
pay me back my $80?</i>

808
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:07,497
Started going back and forth
on music for the scenes.

809
00:45:07,581 --> 00:45:11,167
And they've been down,
and they really came through

810
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:13,670
and gave this a unique
and original score.

811
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:19,092
<i>Baby, this is beautiful and big.</i>

812
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:20,719
<i>Africa.</i>

813
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:25,181
This artwork here is by Omiroo.

814
00:45:25,265 --> 00:45:27,642
O-M-I-R-O-O.

815
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,897
And, uh, except for the, uh, the statues.

816
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:35,358
The statues were something
that the art department made,

817
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:39,195
so that it could help
with the story later on.

818
00:45:39,279 --> 00:45:42,365
Hopefully, you're not watching this
before you watch the movie.

819
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:47,662
<i>I wanted to talk about
a life shaped by exploitation,</i>

820
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:51,416
<i>about fighting for a say
in our own lives,</i>

821
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:54,794
<i>about how beauty, love,
and laughter,</i>

822
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:57,923
<i>thrive and flourish under almost
any circumstances...</i>

823
00:45:58,006 --> 00:45:59,591
I think right now, uh...

824
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:05,513
Cassius feels the way
a lot of people feel when, um...

825
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:08,075
<i>About how you're nodding
like you're listening, but you're not.</i>

826
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,101
<i>Oh, no, sorry, baby. I just...</i>

827
00:46:10,185 --> 00:46:14,397
When folks are really deeply
explaining something

828
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:17,442
that they politically really care about,

829
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:23,865
but is not as connected...

830
00:46:25,158 --> 00:46:27,077
That the other person
is not as connected to.

831
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,037
<i>Yes, okay, listening now.</i>

832
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,874
<i>Capitalism in Africa is booming.</i>

833
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:34,250
<i>Shh! I'm done talking.</i>

834
00:46:35,335 --> 00:46:37,379
<i>I just want to marinate in this.</i>

835
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:39,506
So many scenes
in this movie that I...

836
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:42,175
was asked to cut.

837
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:46,012
That's definitely one of them.

838
00:46:46,096 --> 00:46:49,140
Without it, Detroit
would've been much flatter.

839
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:50,743
<i>It felt good
the other day, right?</i>

840
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:52,268
<i>- Yes.
- It was good, man.</i>

841
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:54,288
<i>It's like I've known y'all
my whole life, you know?</i>

842
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:56,147
<i>Don't forget that, okay?</i>

843
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:58,274
<i>Remember each other's faces.</i>

844
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:01,319
<i>Cassius? What's up, man?
Where you been?</i>

845
00:47:01,403 --> 00:47:02,821
<i>What's up with the suit?</i>

846
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:03,780
<i>I got promoted.</i>

847
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:05,323
That's my father in the hat.

848
00:47:05,407 --> 00:47:06,282
<i>Are you a manager now?</i>

849
00:47:06,366 --> 00:47:08,702
<i>That means
I'm a Power Caller now.</i>

850
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:12,831
This scene right here is, um...

851
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:14,767
<i>We were gonna do it as a team.
Are you on the team?</i>

852
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:19,295
The other scene that I knew
that I would have in the movie,

853
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:25,677
and it's because, uh,

854
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,179
it happened to my little brother, Manuel.

855
00:47:29,431 --> 00:47:34,602
And not the context of him
getting a promotion,

856
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:38,064
but just the compliment, argument thing.

857
00:47:38,148 --> 00:47:41,943
And this was a hard one to make work.

858
00:47:43,737 --> 00:47:46,406
And I was getting nervous
as they were rehearsing it,

859
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:49,701
when we were setting up for the scene.

860
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:55,123
Because to get that tone
that we got here,

861
00:47:56,332 --> 00:48:00,211
is like walking on a tightrope.

862
00:48:00,295 --> 00:48:05,467
You don't want it to be obvious
between those two actors

863
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:09,971
that they are trying to be funny.

864
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:11,264
It doesn't work that way.

865
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:13,725
It will work for some people
but not for me.

866
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:19,397
So the first couple of lines were written,
the rest of it was improvised.

867
00:48:19,481 --> 00:48:24,152
Steven Yeun's face is a big part
of why this scene is funny.

868
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:25,475
<i>It's on me. No, it's on me now!</i>

869
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:26,839
<i>- It's on you?
- Yeah, it's on me now!</i>

870
00:48:26,863 --> 00:48:28,698
<i>- Yeah, it's on me.
- All right!</i>

871
00:48:28,782 --> 00:48:29,908
<i>All right!</i>

872
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:31,910
They really pulled it off.

873
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:33,703
It took a lot of takes to get that one.

874
00:48:34,871 --> 00:48:39,834
And not a lot of takes
because of anything except for,

875
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:42,921
it was a tone that
we hadn't really seen before.

876
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:46,424
Or a thing that
we had never really seen before.

877
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:57,727
<i>Greetings, Cassius Green.</i>

878
00:48:57,811 --> 00:49:00,063
<i>I hope you did not masturbate today.</i>

879
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:02,857
<i>We need you sharp and ready to go.</i>

880
00:49:02,941 --> 00:49:06,277
<i>I detect the pheromones
percolating out of your pores.</i>

881
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:07,946
<i>They say to others around you,</i>

882
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:11,241
<i>"Hold my penis while I piss
on your underestimated expectations."</i>

883
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:13,201
Again, Rosario Dawson.

884
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,453
<i>Mr. Green, I am a computer...</i>

885
00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:16,537
Coming with it.

886
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:20,333
There was a whole
elevator malfunctioning scene

887
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:22,544
in that part that we cut out.

888
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:25,463
There was this whole
interrogation scene

889
00:49:25,547 --> 00:49:27,340
that, uh, we didn't shoot...

890
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:30,885
that came up in that one,
but cut that out.

891
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:32,387
<i>2:00 p.m.</i>

892
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,972
<i>Almost breakfast time in Japan.</i>

893
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:38,393
<i>Oh, okay.
Doodley-doodley-doodley-do.</i>

894
00:49:55,285 --> 00:49:56,995
- Moshi moshi.
<i>- Mr. Son.</i>

895
00:49:57,078 --> 00:49:58,347
<i>Cassius Green
at WorryFree calling.</i>

896
00:49:58,371 --> 00:49:59,247
<i>Sorry to bother you.</i>

897
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,583
<i>I'm calling about
who is assembling your phone.</i>

898
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,751
<i>Now I know
they're being made in China...</i>

899
00:50:03,835 --> 00:50:05,336
And I didn't say it before,

900
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,881
but David Cross is doing...

901
00:50:07,964 --> 00:50:10,008
<i>when I found out
you acquired Tanrio.</i>

902
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:11,759
Lakeith's voice.

903
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:14,470
David Cross is doing Cassius's voice,

904
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:17,515
and Patton Oswalt is doing...

905
00:50:19,434 --> 00:50:22,896
Mr. Blank's voice.

906
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:25,690
I will say "Mr. Blank,"
but that's not how you spell it.

907
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,654
<i>Power Callers,
our very own Cassius Green</i>

908
00:50:31,738 --> 00:50:34,866
<i>just made our client, WorryFree,
upwards of$10 million</i>

909
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:37,744
<i>in one call
on his first day nonetheless.</i>

910
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:38,828
<i>Oh, it's not that much.</i>

911
00:50:38,912 --> 00:50:40,788
<i>Indeed one for the history books.</i>

912
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:41,998
<i>Cheers!</i>

913
00:50:44,209 --> 00:50:45,919
<i>Excuse me for a second.</i>

914
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:47,587
<i>What can I do for you, chum?</i>

915
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:48,880
<i>Yes, I have a question...</i>

916
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:51,341
This next scene coming up...

917
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:54,469
And don't ask me
about Mr. Blank's apple.

918
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:58,806
But this next scene coming up is...

919
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:04,187
maybe one of my favorite
sequences in the movie.

920
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:05,271
One of them.

921
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:08,566
The red to the red.

922
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:14,322
God. You know,
look at Terry's buff wife,

923
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:15,573
like he's buff.

924
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:24,582
Some of these things
are very simple things,

925
00:51:24,666 --> 00:51:29,337
but just putting them together in a way

926
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:33,883
that feels like a reveal
and having a rhythm to it.

927
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:41,099
And obviously helped out
by the amazing music

928
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:43,351
that Tune-Yards has for this.

929
00:51:51,526 --> 00:51:55,321
Boom. Have the sheets cut,
with that on.

930
00:51:56,364 --> 00:51:57,364
Boom.

931
00:51:58,491 --> 00:51:59,826
Boom!

932
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:02,287
And the bed gets wider.

933
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:07,458
There was another move
that we just couldn't pull off,

934
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:12,088
which was the wall
of the other place being here

935
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:14,007
and then getting pulled back.

936
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:18,052
We just weren't able to make it work.

937
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:26,311
Maybe I shouldn't have told you that,
but I just wanted to be real with you.

938
00:52:28,396 --> 00:52:31,441
Because this came out really good.

939
00:52:35,737 --> 00:52:37,780
That's Damion Gallegos,

940
00:52:37,864 --> 00:52:42,076
uh, who co-produced
the soundtrack with me,

941
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,747
and co-produced
the last Coup album with me.

942
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:50,084
He's a funny dude in real life.

943
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:53,629
<i>This was the scene yesterday</i>

944
00:52:53,713 --> 00:52:56,132
<i>at the RegalView
Telemarketers' strike.</i>

945
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:59,135
<i>The striking RegalView workers are joined</i>

946
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:01,637
<i>by other telemarketers,
phone operators,</i>

947
00:53:01,721 --> 00:53:04,724
<i>and university students
from all over the area.</i>

948
00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:11,689
<i>After a long day of hardy-ass
work, you feel me?</i>

949
00:53:11,773 --> 00:53:13,900
<i>We ready to eat.
This is where...</i>

950
00:53:13,983 --> 00:53:16,277
I think that
if there was a WorryFree,

951
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:18,946
there probably would be, you know,

952
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:21,282
some sort of show like this

953
00:53:21,366 --> 00:53:23,659
trying to make you feel
like it was normal.

954
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:26,704
That's Lyrics Born.

955
00:53:28,915 --> 00:53:31,376
<i>What do we want?
We want enough money...</i>

956
00:53:31,459 --> 00:53:32,835
And that's Steven Yeun.

957
00:53:34,087 --> 00:53:38,341
<i>We want enough money to not eat
Cup O' Noodles every night!</i>

958
00:53:39,592 --> 00:53:41,094
<i>I'm sick of Cup O' Noodles!</i>

959
00:53:42,095 --> 00:53:43,930
Really like this scene myself.

960
00:53:44,013 --> 00:53:46,099
<i>When we get drunk one night!</i>

961
00:53:48,226 --> 00:53:50,686
I always kept telling Lakeith

962
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:54,732
that he's really good at watching TV.

963
00:53:56,025 --> 00:54:01,155
Like, you can keep the camera
on him watching TV

964
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:04,659
and you feel a certain way.

965
00:54:11,207 --> 00:54:12,583
<i>Fuck RegalView!</i>

966
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:13,668
<i>Fuck RegalView!</i>

967
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,002
<i>Fuck RegalView!</i>

968
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:19,715
<i>Fuck RegalView! Fuck RegalView!</i>

969
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:22,760
<i>Fuck RegalView! Fuck RegalView!</i>

970
00:54:22,844 --> 00:54:24,429
<i>Fuck RegalView!</i>

971
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:25,847
<i>And fuck chlamydia, too.</i>

972
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:29,142
<i>Although strikers have kept
most replacement workers...</i>

973
00:54:29,225 --> 00:54:30,244
Yeah, that's, um...

974
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:33,479
I always wonder if people recognize
that that's Cassius in the red suit.

975
00:54:33,563 --> 00:54:35,189
That's why we put him in the red suit.

976
00:54:35,273 --> 00:54:38,943
Although, that red suit was awesome
and always...

977
00:54:40,403 --> 00:54:42,280
It kind of got put in that right there,

978
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:44,407
and I didn't see how awesome it was.

979
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:46,784
We didn't have time to change him

980
00:54:46,868 --> 00:54:48,512
because he really
should've been going through

981
00:54:48,536 --> 00:54:49,936
most of the movie in that red suit.

982
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:51,596
<i>Hey baby. Good morning.</i>

983
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:52,808
You live and you learn.

984
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:56,043
<i>Please no! Stop with that
stupid voice, Cassius.</i>

985
00:54:58,129 --> 00:55:00,089
<i>Didn't even realize I was doing it.</i>

986
00:55:00,173 --> 00:55:01,174
<i>Uh...</i>

987
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:04,343
<i>That's a problem, you know.</i>

988
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,888
Um...

989
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:12,310
So, at one point
at the Sundance labs,

990
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:15,897
I was talking to this guy Karim Ainouz,

991
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:18,649
and he was an adviser.

992
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,152
And he said to me,

993
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:23,738
"You know, I really love
your lead character.

994
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:26,657
"I really love Cassius.
I wanna take care of him.

995
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:28,534
"I wanna have a drink with him.

996
00:55:28,618 --> 00:55:30,953
I wanna hang out with him.
I wanna hug him."

997
00:55:31,037 --> 00:55:34,457
And he said,
"That's how I know it's bullshit,

998
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:37,001
because I hate everybody."

999
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:39,378
And what...

1000
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:43,716
And we ended up having this
two or three-hour conversation

1001
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:46,177
about people in our lives...

1002
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:48,804
<i>But they should be! I'm so tired...</i>

1003
00:55:48,888 --> 00:55:51,057
What caused them
to make different decisions

1004
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:52,934
and how they were about it.

1005
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:56,145
And I realized that up until that point,

1006
00:55:56,229 --> 00:55:59,899
I had all the same things
happening in the script,

1007
00:55:59,982 --> 00:56:02,610
but I had it all happening to Cassius.

1008
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:07,782
I had him like a pinball
that was getting slapped around.

1009
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:12,036
And that conversation
made me change the script

1010
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:17,208
and give him agency
and make him make the choices

1011
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:19,710
and be proud of the choices that he made.

1012
00:56:19,794 --> 00:56:22,213
Because that's more true to life.

1013
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:26,926
You know? Yeah, we do think
about those things

1014
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:29,053
and have hangups about them,

1015
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:34,600
but very often, um, people make
the choices

1016
00:56:34,684 --> 00:56:35,953
they think they're supposed to make

1017
00:56:35,977 --> 00:56:38,062
and then dig in their heels more
when they get...

1018
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:42,191
you know, challenged on it.

1019
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:48,823
And the first thing
that changed was this scene.

1020
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,366
<i>- What you doing?
- I'm taking them.</i>

1021
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:51,760
<i>- I'm cold.
- I'm not playing, Cassius!</i>

1022
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:53,262
<i>- You're being greedy.
- Don't play with me!</i>

1023
00:56:53,286 --> 00:56:55,705
This apartment is my boy
Victor Kali's apartment.

1024
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:56,998
He gave it to us for free.

1025
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:58,833
We were in there for two days.

1026
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:04,589
Amazing dude, which it also happened
to be an art gallery. So...

1027
00:57:08,509 --> 00:57:11,804
You know, it's his house,
but he also uses it as an art gallery,

1028
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:14,223
so we didn't have to do much to it.

1029
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,769
<i>Cassius, the old you
was way more interesting.</i>

1030
00:57:22,815 --> 00:57:24,609
<i>If you go to work today at RegalView</i>

1031
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:26,110
<i>crossing the picket line...</i>

1032
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:29,655
<i>we're done.</i>

1033
00:57:29,739 --> 00:57:32,700
<i>Scabs won't pass!
Scabs won't pass!</i>

1034
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:34,702
<i>Assholes and elbows, people! Let's go!</i>

1035
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:38,623
Boom.

1036
00:57:38,706 --> 00:57:40,333
Yeah, that one was hard.

1037
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:44,754
There's violence on all sides in this

1038
00:57:44,837 --> 00:57:47,882
'cause it's the way the world is.

1039
00:57:49,717 --> 00:57:52,386
If you are gonna have a strike,

1040
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:55,931
only way it's gonna work
is if you don't let scabs in.

1041
00:57:56,891 --> 00:57:59,935
Um, and the other side knows this too.

1042
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:03,022
So there's violence on all those sides.

1043
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:06,067
<i>Let's give it up for the boy wonder!</i>

1044
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,568
<i>Huzzah!</i>

1045
00:58:07,652 --> 00:58:11,530
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah! Some
for the homeys and some for me.</i>

1046
00:58:11,614 --> 00:58:15,785
That line
was improvised by Lakeith.

1047
00:58:15,868 --> 00:58:18,537
<i>We hunted mammoths. Yeah!</i>

1048
00:58:19,372 --> 00:58:22,917
<i>Douse him!
Douse our winner with champagne!</i>

1049
00:58:26,504 --> 00:58:30,132
Her art show is called
<i>The New Fuck You,</i>

1050
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:34,011
which is the title of a
Street Sweeper Social Club song.

1051
00:58:34,095 --> 00:58:37,973
Which is... Street Sweeper Social Club
is a group with me and Tom Morello.

1052
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:44,522
Right here, this is
a beautiful work of lighting

1053
00:58:44,605 --> 00:58:47,191
by our lighting guy Drew Nelson.

1054
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:49,670
<i>Scabs won't pass!</i>

1055
00:58:49,694 --> 00:58:52,196
<i>Scabs won't pass!
Scabs won't pass!</i>

1056
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:53,948
<i>Scabs won't pass!</i>

1057
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:56,534
<i>Scabs won't pass!
Scabs won't pass!</i>

1058
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:01,914
In this scene coming up right here,

1059
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:06,711
or this thing that happens
is basically kind of, uh...

1060
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:10,131
I got the idea for this in the script

1061
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:15,052
because we used to go
and fight the Nazis.

1062
00:59:15,136 --> 00:59:17,012
And I mean, the literal Nazis.

1063
00:59:17,096 --> 00:59:19,849
We also fought white supremacists,

1064
00:59:19,932 --> 00:59:23,686
but there were neo-Nazis,
I guess literal neo-Nazis,

1065
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:26,939
and they would come and have rallies.

1066
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:30,568
And one time, they were having a rally
in Union Square in the early '90s,

1067
00:59:30,651 --> 00:59:33,446
and me and some friends took

1068
00:59:33,529 --> 00:59:36,282
a bunch of cans and shook them up.

1069
00:59:36,991 --> 00:59:38,993
<i>Call me.
Million dollar question...</i>

1070
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:41,370
Look at the artwork on his wall

1071
00:59:41,454 --> 00:59:44,081
versus the graph on the other wall.

1072
00:59:45,124 --> 00:59:46,250
It's making a statement.

1073
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:50,296
There's all sorts of little statements
in the production design that we do.

1074
00:59:50,379 --> 00:59:51,422
<i>Fudge all that.</i>

1075
00:59:58,721 --> 00:59:59,847
<i>Hmm.</i>

1076
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,807
<i>Steve Lift is throwing his yearly party.</i>

1077
01:00:01,891 --> 01:00:05,770
This magazine is also
another cool thing

1078
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:08,189
that art department made up.

1079
01:00:09,315 --> 01:00:12,777
A great photoshoot with Armie Hammer

1080
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:16,697
that yielded some other pictures that...

1081
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:23,078
we didn't get to use
that were, nevertheless, great.

1082
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:29,502
This music playing right here

1083
01:00:29,585 --> 01:00:33,631
is not being released
on the initial soundtrack,

1084
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:38,969
but possibly we may release
the rest of the soundtrack.

1085
01:00:39,053 --> 01:00:41,222
<i>Beauty, love and laughter...</i>

1086
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:44,058
Maybe it'll come out
with this DVD. Who knows?

1087
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:47,728
<i>I realize you were
asking about a specific...</i>

1088
01:00:47,812 --> 01:00:48,729
Uh...

1089
01:00:48,813 --> 01:00:52,399
Tessa Thompson being overdubbed
by Lily James.

1090
01:00:58,197 --> 01:01:00,634
<i>You know what?
Will you please excuse me just a moment?</i>

1091
01:01:00,658 --> 01:01:03,744
And that's actually Victor Kali
that she was just talking to,

1092
01:01:03,828 --> 01:01:04,829
who owned...

1093
01:01:06,664 --> 01:01:07,915
the spot.

1094
01:01:09,667 --> 01:01:10,667
In this movie...

1095
01:01:12,253 --> 01:01:16,632
the extras are all friends
and family and I...

1096
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:18,092
It's just good that I have

1097
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:21,178
a lot of friends and family in Oakland.

1098
01:01:23,264 --> 01:01:28,102
And that way,
they can be directed more.

1099
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:30,747
<i>All right. I have to go get
ready for my performance.</i>

1100
01:01:30,771 --> 01:01:32,207
<i>You should really stay
and see it, okay?</i>

1101
01:01:32,231 --> 01:01:36,110
Her earrings, "You're gonna have
to fight your own damn war."

1102
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:38,393
<i>- It's important.
- A slave auctioneer's party?</i>

1103
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:40,239
<i>- Hey.
- Yo, what's up?</i>

1104
01:01:41,282 --> 01:01:42,482
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

1105
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:43,933
<i>I wouldn't miss this for the world.</i>

1106
01:01:44,827 --> 01:01:46,304
<i>You always know
just what to say, huh?</i>

1107
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:48,163
<i>I literally just said that.</i>

1108
01:01:48,247 --> 01:01:49,540
<i>I hope you stay.</i>

1109
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:54,295
<i>Yo, is the reason why you don't call me
no more is cause, uh, you're a sellout,</i>

1110
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:56,380
<i>or cause you're just a star?</i>

1111
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:58,132
<i>What're you talking about?</i>

1112
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,633
<i>Eleven million views, man.</i>

1113
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:02,970
The space that this is in

1114
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:06,390
is the old Best Music.

1115
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:08,767
People didn't understand that.

1116
01:02:08,851 --> 01:02:11,896
That's Indigo Jackson again
as Cynthia Rose.

1117
01:02:11,979 --> 01:02:14,648
But the old Best Music in Oakland

1118
01:02:14,732 --> 01:02:17,401
which is, uh, was the place that...

1119
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:22,573
was the place you had to come
to get instruments,

1120
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:24,992
and it closed down some years ago.

1121
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:27,328
So it's really cool that we were able

1122
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:30,331
to use it as the gallery.

1123
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:37,588
<i>Welcome friends.</i>

1124
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:40,466
Bunch of her Left Eye friends in yellow.

1125
01:02:41,926 --> 01:02:45,930
<i>Tonight, we will have
a transformative experience.</i>

1126
01:02:46,472 --> 01:02:47,723
<i>In those containers...</i>

1127
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:53,979
All amazing artists in Left Eye,
Bay Area artists,

1128
01:02:54,063 --> 01:02:56,398
in either visual

1129
01:02:56,482 --> 01:03:01,111
or, uh, music ways.

1130
01:03:01,195 --> 01:03:03,822
Her outfit right here is an homage

1131
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:05,824
to Prince itself. Right here.

1132
01:03:05,908 --> 01:03:08,494
There's a lot of little Prince things
in this movie.

1133
01:03:08,577 --> 01:03:12,623
Cynthia Rose, the earrings, this.

1134
01:03:13,749 --> 01:03:15,542
It was like <i>Dirty Mind,</i> right here.

1135
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:18,879
<i>Movie entitled</i> The Last Dragon.

1136
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:22,841
<i>I will recite those lines that
Angela says to Eddie Arkadian</i>

1137
01:03:23,509 --> 01:03:24,802
<i>as she leaves him.</i>

1138
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:28,055
<i>Let's begin.</i>

1139
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:31,976
<i>The Last Dragon</i> was
a very important, uh...

1140
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:39,274
movie to me.
I remember watching it in a theater

1141
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:40,901
that we picked specifically

1142
01:03:40,985 --> 01:03:44,321
because the movies
that we used to like to watch

1143
01:03:44,405 --> 01:03:47,324
were where we picked crowds

1144
01:03:47,408 --> 01:03:48,909
where there were funny people in it.

1145
01:03:48,993 --> 01:03:50,536
We would look for those crowds.

1146
01:03:50,619 --> 01:03:53,664
And in high school,
we went to see <i>The Last Dragon</i>

1147
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:56,875
in one of those theaters
which was called The Parkway.

1148
01:03:56,959 --> 01:03:58,419
Not The New Parkway,

1149
01:03:58,502 --> 01:04:01,880
but the old Parkway,
I guess, on Park Boulevard,

1150
01:04:01,964 --> 01:04:03,966
down near East 18th.

1151
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:09,138
And I remember there's a scene
in there with, uh...

1152
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:16,020
with Sho'nuff at the theater in there,

1153
01:04:16,103 --> 01:04:18,063
where I thought that that theater

1154
01:04:18,147 --> 01:04:20,441
was just an exaggerated version

1155
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:23,986
of the theater we were
watching the movie in.

1156
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:26,905
The guy that just threw that last balloon

1157
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:28,699
was Githinji Wa Mbire

1158
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:31,118
who also goes by Omiroo,

1159
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:34,913
the artist that did the Africas.

1160
01:04:34,997 --> 01:04:37,791
<i>And also getting by on my tits!</i>

1161
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:39,835
<i>Hey, hey! Stop!</i>

1162
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:41,503
<i>What the fuck is this?</i>

1163
01:04:41,587 --> 01:04:44,715
This was a hard scene
for everybody in the room

1164
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:47,342
to, um, watch.

1165
01:04:47,426 --> 01:04:49,887
<i>- "Stick to the script."
- No.</i>

1166
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:51,530
<i>Don't you have a party to get to, Cash?</i>

1167
01:04:52,431 --> 01:04:53,431
<i>Go!</i>

1168
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:55,934
<i>Go, Cash.</i>

1169
01:04:56,018 --> 01:04:57,579
Some people don't know
that her voice

1170
01:04:57,603 --> 01:04:59,188
was overdubbed in that part.

1171
01:04:59,271 --> 01:05:00,271
Because...

1172
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:05,027
even though Lily James
has a British accent,

1173
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:08,572
the timbre of her and Tessa's voices
are very similar.

1174
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:12,159
<i>And in the end, Eddie...</i>

1175
01:05:19,917 --> 01:05:24,046
Yeah, um, Armie is a fool for that.

1176
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:28,425
Um, he had to sign a waiver
in order to do that scene.

1177
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,992
<i>Well, I guess you're all wondering
why I've called this meeting.</i>

1178
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:38,328
Originally, that line,
"I guess you're all wondering

1179
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:39,728
why I've called this meeting"

1180
01:05:39,812 --> 01:05:45,484
was a recurring bad joke
that, uh, came up.

1181
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:47,653
It was a joke that my father
would always do,

1182
01:05:47,736 --> 01:05:50,656
and so I put it all
throughout the thing.

1183
01:05:50,739 --> 01:05:53,033
But I realized it wasn't...

1184
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:56,620
as funny to everybody,

1185
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:58,914
but it really worked right there.

1186
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:00,541
<i>Stick around because, uh,</i>

1187
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:02,644
<i>I think a lot of these bitches
are gonna be getting naked.</i>

1188
01:06:02,668 --> 01:06:04,604
Look at the woman
who just fell down back there.

1189
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:06,130
That was funny.

1190
01:06:06,213 --> 01:06:08,340
Um, that was real, though.

1191
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:09,341
It worked.

1192
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:11,864
<i>It's a pleasure to meet you.
An honor even, sir.</i>

1193
01:06:13,053 --> 01:06:14,053
Look at the...

1194
01:06:14,096 --> 01:06:15,824
<i>Ah, yeah. How you doing, man?
You all right?</i>

1195
01:06:15,848 --> 01:06:17,742
<i>I'm really well, thank you.
Thank you for inviting us.</i>

1196
01:06:17,766 --> 01:06:19,101
The wallpaper.

1197
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:20,102
I mean, it's not wallpaper.

1198
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:22,479
The tapestry on the walls right there.

1199
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,940
<i>- Oh. Uh, Steve?
- I never said "Steve."</i>

1200
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:26,441
Pretty damn crazy.

1201
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:29,027
<i>Sir.</i>

1202
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:31,155
This place is called Spring Mansion

1203
01:06:31,238 --> 01:06:32,865
in Berkeley that we used.

1204
01:06:32,948 --> 01:06:34,509
<i>- I'm fucking kidding with you, man!
- Ow! Ow!</i>

1205
01:06:34,533 --> 01:06:37,202
<i>You can call me whatever you want,
you keep closing those deals.</i>

1206
01:06:37,286 --> 01:06:40,789
<i>You must be like a fucking genius.</i>

1207
01:06:40,873 --> 01:06:43,000
In this part,

1208
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:45,169
what Armie is doing here,

1209
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:47,963
what Steve Lift is doing is...

1210
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:50,126
<i>It's people like you that are
gonna save this nation.</i>

1211
01:06:50,424 --> 01:06:55,220
Looking at... is looking at
different parts of Cassius' body,

1212
01:06:55,304 --> 01:06:57,306
in between his sentences,

1213
01:06:57,389 --> 01:07:01,727
and deciding whether Cassius
could kill him with it or not.

1214
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,478
<i>Like a cunning raccoon.</i>

1215
01:07:04,605 --> 01:07:05,731
<i>Like a snake.</i>

1216
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:07,900
<i>Or like a tardigrade.</i>

1217
01:07:12,321 --> 01:07:13,321
<i>Thanks.</i>

1218
01:07:15,574 --> 01:07:17,075
<i>Go, I'll lock up.</i>

1219
01:07:19,036 --> 01:07:20,746
<i>Great performance tonight, D!</i>

1220
01:07:22,456 --> 01:07:24,100
<i>I told you, you didn't have
to do that, really.</i>

1221
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:26,001
<i>No, it's my pleasure.
This is good.</i>

1222
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:30,714
We're about to come up
to one of the most

1223
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:34,676
stupidly controversial scenes
in the movie.

1224
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,803
There were people that were more...

1225
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,389
Not everybody, but some people...

1226
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:41,099
the people that didn't like this

1227
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:43,060
were more mad about this happening

1228
01:07:43,143 --> 01:07:45,896
than they were
about Cassius selling slaves.

1229
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:48,440
<i>All right. Shh,
you can tell me later.</i>

1230
01:07:51,944 --> 01:07:53,153
But fuck 'em.

1231
01:07:54,321 --> 01:07:56,156
That's a joke, whatever.

1232
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,783
Everybody has different opinions.

1233
01:07:57,866 --> 01:07:58,867
We'll talk about it more.

1234
01:07:58,951 --> 01:08:02,454
<i>Crushed, bloody body of my
now inconveniently deceased guide, right?</i>

1235
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:04,790
<i>And just as I get this thing out,
I spin around...</i>

1236
01:08:04,873 --> 01:08:07,292
So this constant critique of art

1237
01:08:07,376 --> 01:08:11,380
and implying myself in it as well.

1238
01:08:12,881 --> 01:08:14,383
<i>Fucker took two mags to the head.</i>

1239
01:08:14,466 --> 01:08:15,884
<i>Turned that bitch into a trophy.</i>

1240
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:22,599
Yeah, um, Omari Hardwick
took that rhino

1241
01:08:22,683 --> 01:08:27,396
after the thing as his wrap present.

1242
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:29,731
So he has it, apparently,
in his living room.

1243
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:31,857
<i>Come on.</i>

1244
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:36,238
<i>I want to hear about some of
that Oakland gangster shit, man.</i>

1245
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:37,364
<i>Oak-town.</i>

1246
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:39,287
<i>- Just right here? Just sit down?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

1247
01:08:40,242 --> 01:08:41,618
<i>Well...</i>

1248
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:43,453
<i>luckily...</i>

1249
01:08:43,537 --> 01:08:47,791
Very proud of this scene
and the way it looks.

1250
01:08:49,334 --> 01:08:52,838
By the way, of course
the way this looks

1251
01:08:52,921 --> 01:08:58,468
is so much to do with Doug Emmett

1252
01:08:58,552 --> 01:09:03,598
and his, you know, his amazing...

1253
01:09:03,682 --> 01:09:08,812
I keep using the word "amazing"
'cause it's so used.

1254
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:15,777
But anyway, his very skillful
and thoughtful way

1255
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:19,364
of framing something.

1256
01:09:19,448 --> 01:09:22,576
And often we'd have back and forths,

1257
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:29,624
and, uh... he'd just one-up
whatever idea I had.

1258
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:34,046
It was good.
It was like cranking the thing up,

1259
01:09:34,129 --> 01:09:36,923
that idea up that I had
and being like, "Well, look",

1260
01:09:37,007 --> 01:09:40,594
"if we just pull it a little bit
more this way, that'd be cool."

1261
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:44,514
Now this scene,
when I originally wrote the movie,

1262
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:47,434
uh, I mean, when I got to this scene.

1263
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:48,995
'Cause I took the journey with Cassius.

1264
01:09:49,019 --> 01:09:51,646
I didn't know exactly everything
that was gonna happen.

1265
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:54,524
I thought that this would be
his turning point.

1266
01:09:54,608 --> 01:09:58,779
And when I wrote it,
I realized it didn't make sense

1267
01:09:58,862 --> 01:10:00,822
for it to be his turning point.

1268
01:10:00,906 --> 01:10:03,658
But it was funny.

1269
01:10:03,742 --> 01:10:08,372
I mean, things that are painful
are also really funny.

1270
01:10:08,455 --> 01:10:11,291
I think that contradiction and irony...

1271
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:15,337
And pain are very much related.

1272
01:10:16,797 --> 01:10:19,424
And in comedy, of course.

1273
01:10:22,344 --> 01:10:26,973
So, you know,
some people were saying that

1274
01:10:27,057 --> 01:10:30,435
they were feeling weird
about laughing about this, but...

1275
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:34,106
You know, um,

1276
01:10:34,189 --> 01:10:36,817
in Richard Pryor's <i>Pryor Convictions,</i>

1277
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:40,237
he starts off each chapter

1278
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:43,365
with one of his hilarious comedy bits.

1279
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:46,243
And that's the first page.

1280
01:10:46,326 --> 01:10:50,705
The rest of it is all the painful,
crazy stuff that he went through.

1281
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:54,167
The stuff that might
make you cry to read it,

1282
01:10:54,251 --> 01:10:55,919
that created that comedy bit.

1283
01:11:03,093 --> 01:11:05,512
This shot, we, uh...

1284
01:11:07,139 --> 01:11:09,224
if you look at it,
you'll see the sun is coming up,

1285
01:11:11,393 --> 01:11:14,771
which kind of works,
kind of makes sense, but...

1286
01:11:17,858 --> 01:11:21,820
we had to go, we had to wrap,
and the sun was coming up.

1287
01:11:21,903 --> 01:11:24,865
So we only had two takes of this.

1288
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:36,710
And we put out a call for people

1289
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:39,588
who were down to get naked
and be in a sex scene.

1290
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:42,924
But in the Bay Area,
you're not just gonna find people

1291
01:11:43,008 --> 01:11:45,594
that are already ready to go, but we did.

1292
01:11:51,892 --> 01:11:53,619
<i>Go through that big-ass foyer.</i>

1293
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:55,437
<i>Go through the door next to the stairs.</i>

1294
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,023
<i>Go down the other stairs, hang a left.</i>

1295
01:11:58,106 --> 01:12:01,693
<i>Go to the end of the hallway,
then make a right.</i>

1296
01:12:01,776 --> 01:12:02,861
<i>You'll see it.</i>

1297
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:06,072
<i>Big magenta colored doors
at the end of the hall.</i>

1298
01:12:06,156 --> 01:12:09,409
This was important
that we waited till now

1299
01:12:09,493 --> 01:12:14,414
to have Mr. Blank finally speak.

1300
01:12:14,498 --> 01:12:17,250
<i>We just thrive in
what is and what is...</i>

1301
01:12:17,334 --> 01:12:20,837
So what he says is his philosophy.

1302
01:12:20,921 --> 01:12:23,006
Which is a lot of people's philosophy

1303
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:26,593
about why they're doing
what they're doing

1304
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:30,931
and not helping to change
the way things are.

1305
01:12:32,933 --> 01:12:36,811
It's a natural thing to come to,
that conclusion,

1306
01:12:36,895 --> 01:12:41,191
if you have no idea
that there's a movement

1307
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:44,569
that can actually do something.

1308
01:13:11,388 --> 01:13:15,684
Students of UC Berkeley
might actually recognize

1309
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:20,480
these hallways as the faculty lounge.

1310
01:13:20,564 --> 01:13:24,985
Not the faculty lounge, the faculty club.

1311
01:13:36,037 --> 01:13:37,247
We, uh...

1312
01:13:38,707 --> 01:13:43,920
shot 61 locations in 28 days
on this movie.

1313
01:13:46,006 --> 01:13:47,757
So we were moving fast.

1314
01:13:48,842 --> 01:13:49,843
<i>Heads up.</i>

1315
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:52,804
There was originally much more

1316
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:55,265
that was supposed to go into this office,

1317
01:13:55,348 --> 01:13:58,935
I think... but we did not have the time...

1318
01:14:02,147 --> 01:14:04,774
and ran out of money

1319
01:14:04,858 --> 01:14:07,360
to do some of the things I wanted to do.

1320
01:14:07,444 --> 01:14:13,033
But I think we got
the perfect amount done.

1321
01:14:16,244 --> 01:14:17,244
<i>Fuck it.</i>

1322
01:14:18,538 --> 01:14:19,873
Next time you watch it,

1323
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:23,335
watch it while noticing the paintings
that are behind him.

1324
01:14:26,421 --> 01:14:29,382
<i>Ah! Fuck! It's strong.</i>

1325
01:14:29,466 --> 01:14:32,427
They actually sold
those plates online.

1326
01:14:33,428 --> 01:14:35,764
<i>And I wanna listen
to your proposition, Stevie.</i>

1327
01:14:37,057 --> 01:14:39,809
<i>I want you at WorryFree.</i>

1328
01:14:40,852 --> 01:14:43,063
<i>I see something in you.</i>

1329
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:44,814
<i>I think that you are more than just</i>

1330
01:14:44,898 --> 01:14:47,567
<i>the world's greatest telemarketer
since "Hal Jameson."</i>

1331
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:53,073
Um, Armie's idea
for his... the fangs on his beard

1332
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:55,158
was supposed to be, uh...

1333
01:14:56,576 --> 01:14:58,620
mimicking his agent.

1334
01:14:58,703 --> 01:15:00,038
I don't know who that is.

1335
01:15:03,083 --> 01:15:05,377
Armie's only, like, 31 years old,

1336
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:09,589
but in here, um,
he's able to look older.

1337
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:15,387
So, like I said,

1338
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:19,891
originally, I thought that
the performance,

1339
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:22,852
the rap performance
would be his turning point,

1340
01:15:22,936 --> 01:15:24,771
but I realize in a world where

1341
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:30,610
there's literal slave labor being sold
and he's one of the people selling them,

1342
01:15:30,694 --> 01:15:34,531
and that slave labor
is accepted in the world,

1343
01:15:35,532 --> 01:15:39,077
how could that be his turning point?

1344
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,413
Oh, they're racist and that's enough?

1345
01:15:41,496 --> 01:15:45,875
No, I realized we...
he needed something

1346
01:15:45,959 --> 01:15:49,879
to shake him to his mortal core,

1347
01:15:49,963 --> 01:15:51,506
to make him see who he was.

1348
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:54,592
Cause that's what the rap
performance scene was supposed to do,

1349
01:15:54,676 --> 01:15:56,803
was to make him see who he was.

1350
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:57,971
And this...

1351
01:15:58,054 --> 01:15:59,639
<i>No! No, I can't. Sorry.</i>

1352
01:15:59,723 --> 01:16:04,352
Is also supposed to be someone...
something to make him see who he was,

1353
01:16:04,436 --> 01:16:10,650
but in a way that shook him
out of that world enough...

1354
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:12,527
<i>Okay.</i>

1355
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:13,945
For him to see.

1356
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:17,407
And so, as I decided to write this,
I really asked myself,

1357
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:19,451
"Are you really gonna do this?"

1358
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:21,953
And I was like, yep.

1359
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:24,914
<i>- Help me!
- Fuck!</i>

1360
01:16:24,998 --> 01:16:26,124
<i>Help me!</i>

1361
01:16:26,207 --> 01:16:29,127
<i>Help me!</i>

1362
01:16:30,712 --> 01:16:32,630
I knew that
it had to be done right

1363
01:16:32,714 --> 01:16:34,841
or it would seem like a joke.

1364
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:37,802
So we got Amalgamated
Dynamics Incorporated.

1365
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:41,639
Tom Woodruff and Alec Gillis,

1366
01:16:41,723 --> 01:16:44,851
the ones who did the creature effects

1367
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:48,688
for <i>Alien vs. Predator to</i> do it.

1368
01:16:48,772 --> 01:16:50,064
<i>I said the jade door!</i>

1369
01:16:50,148 --> 01:16:52,317
And actually, Tom Woodruff...

1370
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,170
<i>No, that's an olive door.
That's very clearly...</i>

1371
01:16:54,194 --> 01:16:58,782
Who was an alien in <i>Alien vs. Predator,</i>

1372
01:16:58,865 --> 01:17:00,533
was in a suit for this one.

1373
01:17:00,617 --> 01:17:01,761
<i>Let's just take a deep breath.</i>

1374
01:17:01,785 --> 01:17:07,415
It's actually just one suit
with four different heads and different...

1375
01:17:07,499 --> 01:17:11,002
We shifted around the hair patches

1376
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:14,255
and the, uh, tattoos to make them...

1377
01:17:14,339 --> 01:17:18,760
and then shaded them different
to make them seem different.

1378
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:21,638
And Tom Woodruff is in all of them.

1379
01:17:21,721 --> 01:17:23,574
<i>You went in there,
you wouldn't even be scared.</i>

1380
01:17:23,598 --> 01:17:24,700
<i>What the fuck was that thing?</i>

1381
01:17:24,724 --> 01:17:27,018
I would say that
all of these characters

1382
01:17:27,101 --> 01:17:29,771
are like me in certain ways,

1383
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:33,316
and definitely this is the way
Steve Lift is like me.

1384
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:37,028
I like to force my friends
to watch movies

1385
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:38,446
they don't want to watch.

1386
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:44,452
<i>There's a lot
of production value in this.</i>

1387
01:17:45,495 --> 01:17:48,623
This is not actually done
by Michel Dongry

1388
01:17:48,706 --> 01:17:50,708
or Michel Gondry.

1389
01:17:52,126 --> 01:17:56,089
It is done by Ri Crawford and David Lauer,

1390
01:17:57,549 --> 01:18:00,844
two folks that do stop-motion animation,

1391
01:18:00,927 --> 01:18:03,721
um, a lot for times for Tippett Studios,

1392
01:18:03,805 --> 01:18:05,765
but this they did on their own.

1393
01:18:05,849 --> 01:18:11,479
And, um, my involvement
was in the animatic stage.

1394
01:18:14,691 --> 01:18:19,946
I worked with them back
and forth on the animatic,

1395
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:24,951
which is the drawing... the drawing version
of all of this stuff,

1396
01:18:26,077 --> 01:18:28,872
which is slightly animated
in the computer.

1397
01:18:30,123 --> 01:18:34,586
And while we were actually shooting,
this was being shot.

1398
01:18:34,669 --> 01:18:36,754
And they did this in just
a couple of weeks

1399
01:18:36,838 --> 01:18:40,592
after the animatics...
after the stuff was...

1400
01:18:40,675 --> 01:18:42,927
the things were made.

1401
01:18:43,011 --> 01:18:45,072
So it's not... Some people
thought it was claymation.

1402
01:18:45,096 --> 01:18:46,598
It's not actually claymation.

1403
01:18:47,974 --> 01:18:49,851
They molded the figures.

1404
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:54,022
In the script, it's pretty...

1405
01:18:55,273 --> 01:18:59,444
a lot of this stuff is written in there.

1406
01:18:59,527 --> 01:19:01,779
We did, obviously, edit stuff down

1407
01:19:01,863 --> 01:19:04,365
so they would have less work to do.

1408
01:19:04,449 --> 01:19:06,910
<i>Human productivity is dawning.</i>

1409
01:19:06,993 --> 01:19:08,995
<i>Our workforce of equisapiens...</i>

1410
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:12,248
Yeah, these are actual... they poured...

1411
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:16,169
um, into the molds

1412
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:22,008
and made figures around,
uh, around wire frames

1413
01:19:22,091 --> 01:19:23,843
that could be posed.

1414
01:19:23,927 --> 01:19:25,553
<i>There's no fucking
misunderstanding, man!</i>

1415
01:19:25,637 --> 01:19:29,891
<i>So you're making half-human
half-horse fucking things...</i>

1416
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:31,893
For some reason,
I love that picture

1417
01:19:31,976 --> 01:19:33,645
of Lakeith with his hands open.

1418
01:19:33,728 --> 01:19:35,331
<i>I just didn't want you
to think I was crazy.</i>

1419
01:19:35,355 --> 01:19:38,942
<i>That I was doing this for no reason,
because this isn't irrational.</i>

1420
01:19:39,025 --> 01:19:40,526
<i>Oh.</i>

1421
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:41,945
<i>Cool. All right.</i>

1422
01:19:42,028 --> 01:19:43,363
<i>Cool. No, I understand.</i>

1423
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:44,924
<i>I just... I just got to leave now, man.</i>

1424
01:19:44,948 --> 01:19:46,908
<i>So, please get the fuck
out of my way.</i>

1425
01:19:46,991 --> 01:19:48,177
<i>You haven't finished the movie.</i>

1426
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:50,679
<i>Call me about that next week,
please, and then we'll... we'll talk.</i>

1427
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:53,414
<i>You're gonna sit in that chair</i>

1428
01:19:53,498 --> 01:19:55,416
<i>and we're gonna watch this movie.</i>

1429
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:56,894
<i>And then I'm gonna make you a proposal.</i>

1430
01:19:56,918 --> 01:19:58,920
Yeah, again,

1431
01:19:59,003 --> 01:20:03,591
I really relate to me trying to
get people to watch movies.

1432
01:20:05,218 --> 01:20:07,845
They really don't understand
how important the movie is

1433
01:20:07,929 --> 01:20:09,097
I'm gonna show them.

1434
01:20:15,895 --> 01:20:17,895
<i>It works for 70 percent of humans</i>

1435
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:19,857
<i>who take the fusing catalyst.</i>

1436
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:38,543
And again, the animatic
of the other thing

1437
01:20:38,626 --> 01:20:41,462
pretty much had to match
frame by frame...

1438
01:20:41,546 --> 01:20:45,299
frame for frame...
so that they could do it right.

1439
01:20:45,383 --> 01:20:47,176
<i>What the... what the fuck was that?</i>

1440
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:48,445
<i>- Wait, what?
- What did I snort?</i>

1441
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:50,239
<i>- Cause I'm not even fucking high.
- You're not what?</i>

1442
01:20:50,263 --> 01:20:52,015
<i>Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait.</i>

1443
01:20:52,098 --> 01:20:54,726
<i>No, no, no, I don't give a fuck
about that anymore, all right?</i>

1444
01:20:54,809 --> 01:20:56,120
<i>I don't give a fuck about that shit.</i>

1445
01:20:56,144 --> 01:20:58,771
<i>If you had me snort some shit
that's gonna have me mutated, man...</i>

1446
01:20:58,855 --> 01:21:00,898
This scene here is actually

1447
01:21:00,982 --> 01:21:03,234
one that we did in the labs, too.

1448
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:05,087
<i>I need you to be a little bit
more particular, man!</i>

1449
01:21:05,111 --> 01:21:06,779
So, it was...

1450
01:21:06,863 --> 01:21:10,867
That... that was really good to do, uh,

1451
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:13,953
kind of test it out even with other actors

1452
01:21:14,037 --> 01:21:16,748
to kind of get a sense of...

1453
01:21:16,831 --> 01:21:20,460
where you thought you were going
to have to keep it going at,

1454
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:24,172
where you thought
you were gonna need

1455
01:21:24,255 --> 01:21:30,845
to invent ways to make it
interesting, visually.

1456
01:21:30,928 --> 01:21:33,598
<i>Is because your adrenaline
is pumping so hard right now,</i>

1457
01:21:33,681 --> 01:21:37,018
<i>that, to be perfectly honest, you're
starting to harsh both of our mellows.</i>

1458
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:39,312
<i>Okay? So sit down and just...</i>

1459
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:42,273
That was
an interesting discussion,

1460
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:44,358
'cause it used to be "harsh your buzz."

1461
01:21:45,485 --> 01:21:47,987
He changed it to "harsh your mellow,"

1462
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:52,325
um, and "harsh both of our mellows."

1463
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:55,787
It was something he asked for
that I gave in on

1464
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:57,246
that I think he was right about.

1465
01:21:57,330 --> 01:21:58,873
It's a little funnier that way.

1466
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:03,795
I don't know, 'cause
we didn't say "harsh your buzz,"

1467
01:22:03,878 --> 01:22:05,421
so, who knows?

1468
01:22:05,505 --> 01:22:07,131
<i>I'm gonna have millions of 'em.</i>

1469
01:22:07,215 --> 01:22:08,508
<i>This is fucking crazy.</i>

1470
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:10,343
<i>They're gonna form their own society.</i>

1471
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:12,220
<i>They'll probably form their own culture.</i>

1472
01:22:12,303 --> 01:22:13,447
<i>Then maybe they wanna organize.</i>

1473
01:22:13,471 --> 01:22:15,389
<i>Maybe they wanna rebel.</i>

1474
01:22:15,473 --> 01:22:18,392
<i>And that's why we need
someone on the inside</i>

1475
01:22:18,476 --> 01:22:21,270
<i>who represents WorryFree's needs.</i>

1476
01:22:21,354 --> 01:22:23,439
I like how he's about
to say "interests"

1477
01:22:23,523 --> 01:22:25,483
and changes it to "needs."

1478
01:22:27,819 --> 01:22:30,029
<i>- For fucking horse people.
- No. No...</i>

1479
01:22:30,113 --> 01:22:32,698
And you kinda see
how someone is thinking.

1480
01:22:32,782 --> 01:22:35,785
<i>Equisapien Martin Luther King, Jr.</i>

1481
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:40,790
Again, beautiful, chilling score

1482
01:22:40,873 --> 01:22:45,169
by Tune-Yards happening right here.

1483
01:22:45,253 --> 01:22:48,506
I mean, all the score
is by Tune-Yards, but...

1484
01:22:48,589 --> 01:22:50,633
<i>Yeah, keep shit simple.</i>

1485
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:52,468
<i>Fuck, man.</i>

1486
01:22:53,636 --> 01:22:55,721
<i>Well, why the fuck
did you choose me?</i>

1487
01:22:55,805 --> 01:22:58,474
<i>Out of everybody you could've chose,
why did you pick me? For what?</i>

1488
01:22:58,558 --> 01:22:59,892
<i>Cash, Cash.</i>

1489
01:23:01,144 --> 01:23:04,313
This was a shot I knew was
in the movie when I wrote it.

1490
01:23:04,397 --> 01:23:06,440
<i>I've never seen anyone go
through the ranks</i>

1491
01:23:06,524 --> 01:23:08,734
<i>at RegalView like you did. Hmm?</i>

1492
01:23:08,818 --> 01:23:11,445
<i>And I want someone like that
at WorryFree.</i>

1493
01:23:12,655 --> 01:23:14,574
It's kinda symmetrical, kinda...

1494
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:17,326
This is probably like
the most Wes Anderson shot

1495
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:18,452
we have in the movie.

1496
01:23:19,453 --> 01:23:20,973
<i>I can see that you're freaked out,</i>

1497
01:23:20,997 --> 01:23:22,123
<i>and that you want to say no.</i>

1498
01:23:23,374 --> 01:23:25,574
<i>But I wouldn't do that before
you see what I'm offering.</i>

1499
01:23:33,134 --> 01:23:34,886
<i>No, man. No, no.</i>

1500
01:23:34,969 --> 01:23:37,597
<i>There's no fucking amount of money
that'll make me do that shit.</i>

1501
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:38,723
<i>Two things.</i>

1502
01:23:38,806 --> 01:23:41,017
<i>One, it's a short-term contract.</i>

1503
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,810
<i>Five years, done.</i>

1504
01:23:42,894 --> 01:23:45,855
<i>Then we give you the diffuser antidote
special sauce serum...</i>

1505
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:48,125
Yeah, that diffuser
antidote special sauce serum,

1506
01:23:48,149 --> 01:23:51,235
that was something that was hard
for people to remember.

1507
01:23:51,319 --> 01:23:53,112
<i>You're gonna have a horse cock.</i>

1508
01:23:55,656 --> 01:23:59,243
<i>What the fuck is a special antidote
sauce serum? What the...</i>

1509
01:23:59,327 --> 01:24:01,555
<i>It sounds like you made that shit up, man.
That shit ain't real.</i>

1510
01:24:01,579 --> 01:24:02,914
<i>No, it's real.</i>

1511
01:24:02,997 --> 01:24:04,582
<i>And so is my offer.</i>

1512
01:24:04,665 --> 01:24:07,335
<i>Five years as our man amongst horses</i>

1513
01:24:07,418 --> 01:24:09,754
<i>for $100 million.</i>

1514
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:12,965
<i>Just go sleep on it, okay?</i>

1515
01:24:13,049 --> 01:24:16,761
<i>And after that,
holla at your boy. Okay?</i>

1516
01:24:18,012 --> 01:24:20,348
<i>Get out in that party
and go fuck something.</i>

1517
01:24:28,064 --> 01:24:30,650
This is the Cathedral Building
in Oakland,

1518
01:24:30,733 --> 01:24:32,902
which is where their apartment is.

1519
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:38,115
We were lucky to get
this spot because...

1520
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:42,912
it's such a well-known spot.

1521
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:51,337
<i>Oh, fuck. Fuck.</i>

1522
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:55,675
Again, you stay
on Lakeith's face,

1523
01:24:55,758 --> 01:24:58,803
and it's so expressive
but in ways that...

1524
01:25:01,722 --> 01:25:07,103
aren't very normal for other actors.

1525
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:11,315
A lot of what he does...

1526
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:20,074
is just making sure
that he is emotionally there.

1527
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:24,495
He's not making sure that
his face looks a certain way,

1528
01:25:24,578 --> 01:25:26,122
and that he emotes a certain thing.

1529
01:25:26,205 --> 01:25:28,708
That's not what he's doing.

1530
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:34,130
Which, uh, I don't know,
I've never directed a play,

1531
01:25:34,213 --> 01:25:37,925
but I imagine that often it's what, uh,

1532
01:25:38,009 --> 01:25:40,469
theater actors might be doing on stage,

1533
01:25:40,553 --> 01:25:42,680
'cause you have to do that
a little bit more.

1534
01:25:42,763 --> 01:25:45,349
But he's just making sure
that he's emotionally there,

1535
01:25:45,433 --> 01:25:50,980
and then, I think everything
else comes from there.

1536
01:25:51,063 --> 01:25:57,236
And so, uh, he ends up emoting
in a more natural way.

1537
01:26:00,072 --> 01:26:01,198
<i>Jake?</i>

1538
01:26:01,282 --> 01:26:03,743
<i>What're you talking about?
No, Cassius.</i>

1539
01:26:03,826 --> 01:26:05,619
<i>Cassius Green.</i>

1540
01:26:08,748 --> 01:26:10,583
He's talking to Eric Arnold

1541
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:12,835
who's an actual writer.

1542
01:26:12,918 --> 01:26:16,088
That's the Yuka lady actually.

1543
01:26:16,172 --> 01:26:19,342
She's playing this character on there.

1544
01:26:19,425 --> 01:26:23,596
<i>Voila!
Have-a-Cola-and-smile-bitch wig.</i>

1545
01:26:26,766 --> 01:26:29,185
<i>Fuck! Where the fuck
is my cellphone?</i>

1546
01:26:32,355 --> 01:26:34,875
<i>And the strangest thing
to happen in advertising history,</i>

1547
01:26:34,899 --> 01:26:37,234
<i>Soda Cola has announced
working with Cynthia Rose,</i>

1548
01:26:37,318 --> 01:26:39,779
<i>the foul-mouthed heroine
with perfect aim</i>

1549
01:26:39,862 --> 01:26:42,615
<i>from the "Cola-and-Smile-Bitch"
YouTube clip.</i>

1550
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:44,492
<i>Rose reportedly signed
for an amount of money</i>

1551
01:26:44,575 --> 01:26:46,327
<i>that could buy four white babies.</i>

1552
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,995
<i>The strikebreaker
who was hilariously...</i>

1553
01:26:48,079 --> 01:26:50,748
This was, uh, fun.

1554
01:26:50,831 --> 01:26:54,085
That's Gabby La La, my baby mama.

1555
01:26:54,168 --> 01:26:55,669
<i>I got a little worried, you know.</i>

1556
01:26:55,753 --> 01:26:57,397
<i>Because I was looking at it
maybe from up here.</i>

1557
01:26:57,421 --> 01:26:59,340
<i>But that it might be different.</i>

1558
01:26:59,423 --> 01:27:01,884
Um, this guy was one of my doctors.

1559
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:05,679
<i>No, no. It's the same size.</i>

1560
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:11,936
Again, that's a outfit, uh, collaboration

1561
01:27:12,019 --> 01:27:14,814
between Deirdre Govan and Omiroo.

1562
01:27:14,897 --> 01:27:16,357
<i>What is up with you, Cash?</i>

1563
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:18,609
<i>YOU CALLED ME AT 3:23.
You left a video message.</i>

1564
01:27:18,692 --> 01:27:20,796
<i>I didn't check it because
I assumed it was lewd as fuck</i>

1565
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:23,322
<i>- and I wasn't trying to do that...
- Can I see that?</i>

1566
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:26,909
Omiroo painted all over it.

1567
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:29,995
Matter of fact, because
he's painting all the time,

1568
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:32,623
a lot of the times,
his clothes end up looking

1569
01:27:32,706 --> 01:27:34,750
exactly like that by accident.

1570
01:27:36,252 --> 01:27:39,505
<i>We're hurting! Help us! Help us!</i>

1571
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:41,715
<i>Get back in there! Get in there!</i>

1572
01:27:41,799 --> 01:27:42,919
<i>Please, help us!</i>

1573
01:27:44,885 --> 01:27:46,095
<i>We're hurting!</i>

1574
01:27:47,346 --> 01:27:49,140
<i>Security code cleared.</i>

1575
01:27:50,516 --> 01:27:52,786
I always thought we messed up
when we showed her phone

1576
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:55,729
'cause I felt like Detroit's phone case

1577
01:27:55,813 --> 01:27:58,399
would've been
way more decorated than that.

1578
01:28:02,903 --> 01:28:04,280
This, uh...

1579
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:09,410
The shots that happen here,
um, from longer away,

1580
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:13,706
were really inspired.

1581
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:17,334
Looked for this shot
because of some stuff

1582
01:28:17,418 --> 01:28:19,879
in <i>One from the Heart where</i> they do...

1583
01:28:19,962 --> 01:28:22,715
In Francis Ford Coppola's
<i>One from the Heart</i>

1584
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:25,342
where they do a lot of stuff
with reflection.

1585
01:28:25,426 --> 01:28:28,804
The scene... the shot doesn't look anything
like <i>One from the Heart,</i>

1586
01:28:28,888 --> 01:28:33,017
but it just gave me
the idea of the reflection.

1587
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:38,731
We found this spot which was
right by the Cathedral Building.

1588
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:40,414
<i>Relax a little bit so I can see.</i>

1589
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,861
<i>Okay, okay.
They're the normal size.</i>

1590
01:28:43,944 --> 01:28:46,655
<i>They look normal sized.
They look normal sized.</i>

1591
01:28:46,739 --> 01:28:48,115
<i>You are okay.</i>

1592
01:29:02,588 --> 01:29:03,881
And, um...

1593
01:29:06,425 --> 01:29:08,219
This song right here

1594
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:13,891
that's playing, um, in the background,

1595
01:29:13,974 --> 01:29:16,977
has, uh, me,

1596
01:29:17,061 --> 01:29:20,606
Silk-E, who's also
in The Coup, and Janelle Monae.

1597
01:29:21,607 --> 01:29:23,734
<i>- I still have problems with all this.
- I'm not...</i>

1598
01:29:23,817 --> 01:29:25,754
<i>Only something happening to you
turned you against them.</i>

1599
01:29:25,778 --> 01:29:27,279
<i>Okay. But I know how they view me.</i>

1600
01:29:27,363 --> 01:29:31,325
<i>How I look in the eyes of
fucking WorryFree and RegalView.</i>

1601
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:35,246
<i>They just view me as another one
of their fucking creatures...</i>

1602
01:29:35,329 --> 01:29:38,415
The lighting
in this scene is very different

1603
01:29:39,625 --> 01:29:42,378
from anything else in the movie,

1604
01:29:42,461 --> 01:29:46,674
but it's also a mood that
we haven't had in the movie.

1605
01:29:46,757 --> 01:29:48,717
<i>That doesn't change what I said about us.</i>

1606
01:29:50,928 --> 01:29:54,098
<i>And also, I kinda messed around
with somebody last night.</i>

1607
01:29:54,181 --> 01:29:55,474
<i>What? Wait.</i>

1608
01:29:56,809 --> 01:29:58,686
<i>What do you mean you kinda...</i>

1609
01:29:58,769 --> 01:30:00,830
<i>I need you to explain that one,
'cause I don't understand...</i>

1610
01:30:00,854 --> 01:30:03,899
And right here
is a shot of Lakeith's ass.

1611
01:30:03,983 --> 01:30:07,361
But that shot was probably
the quickest one that there was.

1612
01:30:07,444 --> 01:30:09,363
There was one that was longer.

1613
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:13,867
'Cause I really felt like
you have to see...

1614
01:30:13,951 --> 01:30:17,830
Like, for it to feel real, you need to see

1615
01:30:17,913 --> 01:30:21,292
people just bare as possible.

1616
01:30:21,375 --> 01:30:25,129
But, um, the other shots that took longer

1617
01:30:25,212 --> 01:30:27,423
just didn't fit in here.

1618
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:29,550
Anyway, this is, uh...

1619
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:36,473
the part where people like,
"Why did this happen?"

1620
01:30:36,557 --> 01:30:39,560
And, um, the truth is is that

1621
01:30:39,643 --> 01:30:43,564
her dude that she was down with

1622
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:48,861
was totally against everything
she was for all of a sudden

1623
01:30:48,944 --> 01:30:51,530
and, um, didn't...

1624
01:30:51,614 --> 01:30:56,452
and was selling slaves
and came and interrupted her art show.

1625
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:02,082
She went for somebody
that was way closer

1626
01:31:02,166 --> 01:31:03,626
to what she was about.

1627
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,646
"Tell Homeland Security
we are the bomb."

1628
01:31:23,729 --> 01:31:28,067
That's a quote from a Coup lyric

1629
01:31:28,150 --> 01:31:30,277
from the song "The Magic Clap,"

1630
01:31:30,361 --> 01:31:35,032
and also the title of a book of my lyrics.

1631
01:31:41,038 --> 01:31:43,457
For those of you
that maybe don't know,

1632
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:50,381
I am also the lead vocalist
and producer of The Coup.

1633
01:31:50,464 --> 01:31:51,882
That's Mistah F.A.B.

1634
01:31:53,759 --> 01:31:55,636
Rolling up, Mistah F.A.B.

1635
01:31:57,721 --> 01:31:58,972
Bay Area legend.

1636
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:00,599
<i>What the fuck, man?</i>

1637
01:32:00,683 --> 01:32:01,850
<i>For you lying!</i>

1638
01:32:01,934 --> 01:32:05,646
This was a fun
and interesting scene to shoot.

1639
01:32:07,481 --> 01:32:09,692
Maybe first stunt.

1640
01:32:13,195 --> 01:32:14,195
<i>That's all right.</i>

1641
01:32:15,155 --> 01:32:16,490
<i>Happens to the best of us.</i>

1642
01:32:21,328 --> 01:32:22,955
<i>Walk it off!</i>

1643
01:32:23,038 --> 01:32:29,795
The ADR. On that was very helpful.

1644
01:32:32,297 --> 01:32:35,592
This is Cassius Green
from "Have a Cola and smile, bitch" fame.

1645
01:32:35,676 --> 01:32:37,386
I want to be on your show tomorrow.

1646
01:32:42,516 --> 01:32:46,729
Fake Cassius and Cynthia Rose.

1647
01:32:53,777 --> 01:32:56,572
<i>I got the shit kicked out of me!</i>

1648
01:32:56,655 --> 01:32:59,950
<i>Today, YouTube sensation
Cassius Green is here.</i>

1649
01:33:00,033 --> 01:33:01,660
<i>You had 500 million people</i>

1650
01:33:01,744 --> 01:33:04,371
<i>watch you get pegged to the noggin
and get utterly humiliated.</i>

1651
01:33:04,455 --> 01:33:05,581
<i>It was effing hilarious.</i>

1652
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:07,624
<i>The way your hair went up like that!</i>

1653
01:33:09,126 --> 01:33:11,587
<i>The whole world is laughing
till they pissed.</i>

1654
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:14,882
<i>Well, I got a new clip
that I need you to play.</i>

1655
01:33:14,965 --> 01:33:16,925
<i>And the only reason I came on this show</i>

1656
01:33:17,009 --> 01:33:18,927
<i>was because you agreed to show this clip</i>

1657
01:33:19,011 --> 01:33:20,971
<i>to your 150 million viewers.</i>

1658
01:33:21,054 --> 01:33:23,214
<i>Well, If you want some ass,
you have to bring some ass.</i>

1659
01:33:23,265 --> 01:33:24,641
<i>So get ready for an ass-whupping,</i>

1660
01:33:24,725 --> 01:33:26,059
<i>then jump in the shit tank,</i>

1661
01:33:26,143 --> 01:33:28,479
<i>then we'll play your clip.</i>

1662
01:33:43,494 --> 01:33:46,330
Went through a lot
on the sound for that.

1663
01:33:46,413 --> 01:33:49,708
That was the actual
regular "that's all, folks."

1664
01:33:49,792 --> 01:33:53,754
<i>Okay. Is it as crazy as
the Cola-and-a-smile-bitch clip?</i>

1665
01:33:53,837 --> 01:33:55,422
<i>Not possible!</i>

1666
01:33:56,882 --> 01:34:00,469
<i>It's crazy, Mary.
It's fucking crazy.</i>

1667
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:02,888
<i>Woo-hoo! Let's roll the clip.</i>

1668
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:04,473
Cake batter.

1669
01:34:04,556 --> 01:34:07,976
<i>We're hurting! We're hurting!</i>

1670
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:11,104
<i>If you beautiful perversions
don't shut the fuck up,</i>

1671
01:34:11,188 --> 01:34:13,357
<i>I will turn you all to glue!</i>

1672
01:34:15,734 --> 01:34:19,238
<i>As a Power Caller for RegalView,
WorryFree was my premier client.</i>

1673
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:22,157
<i>This is just incontrovertible proof</i>

1674
01:34:22,241 --> 01:34:24,159
<i>of WorryFree's evil practices.</i>

1675
01:34:24,243 --> 01:34:27,287
<i>They're turning humans
into grotesque horse-people.</i>

1676
01:34:27,371 --> 01:34:29,540
<i>And I want the world to know</i>

1677
01:34:29,623 --> 01:34:32,334
<i>that... that they are
manipulating humanity</i>

1678
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:34,294
<i>for the sake of profit.</i>

1679
01:34:34,378 --> 01:34:36,421
<i>Now, we cannot let this go on!</i>

1680
01:34:36,505 --> 01:34:40,592
You know, a lot of times
the idea in movies is

1681
01:34:40,676 --> 01:34:44,012
if you expose the problem,
that's the end of it.

1682
01:34:44,096 --> 01:34:47,307
Like, the end of it is
"Wow, they exposed the problem."

1683
01:34:47,391 --> 01:34:49,017
In, you know,
most movies, Steve Lift

1684
01:34:49,101 --> 01:34:52,563
would be going off to jail
because of it.

1685
01:34:52,646 --> 01:34:55,941
But that's not... I don't believe
that's how it works in the real world.

1686
01:34:56,024 --> 01:34:59,403
So, it didn't happen
like that in this world.

1687
01:34:59,486 --> 01:35:01,947
<i>To celebrate
the record stock market rally.</i>

1688
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:04,157
<i>- WorryFree's success has created.
- Fuck you!</i>

1689
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:07,035
And, you know,

1690
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:10,205
that's also the conversation about art.

1691
01:35:10,289 --> 01:35:13,375
A lot of times,
the idea with an artist is,

1692
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:16,003
"I'm doing my job.
I'm exposing the bullshit."

1693
01:35:17,546 --> 01:35:19,590
And that's not enough.

1694
01:35:21,258 --> 01:35:25,304
You got to connect with folks.

1695
01:35:25,387 --> 01:35:27,681
At least connect with folks that are...

1696
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:33,687
trying to make some material
changes in the situation,

1697
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:35,522
and that are organizing.

1698
01:35:37,232 --> 01:35:41,486
Everybody can't just be, like,
saying what the problem is,

1699
01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:43,196
and that includes artists.

1700
01:35:44,573 --> 01:35:48,660
If you are an artist and you just expose
what the problem is,

1701
01:35:50,537 --> 01:35:53,457
you don't even know the exact
right problem to expose.

1702
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:56,752
You don't even know the question
that folks are having.

1703
01:35:56,835 --> 01:36:01,423
As Squeeze talks about here,
people know what the problem is.

1704
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:04,593
But if all we're doing
is saying what the problem is,

1705
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:08,430
but not connecting it
to how we can change stuff,

1706
01:36:09,514 --> 01:36:12,434
then we're just adding to it.

1707
01:36:12,517 --> 01:36:17,356
We're just proving the point
to the powers that be

1708
01:36:17,439 --> 01:36:18,999
that, "Yeah,
there's a lot of problems",

1709
01:36:19,066 --> 01:36:20,943
and you can't do anything about it."

1710
01:36:21,026 --> 01:36:22,444
<i>It's important.</i>

1711
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:25,072
<i>If you can stop them
from crossing the picket lines...</i>

1712
01:36:25,155 --> 01:36:27,240
But the key is to...

1713
01:36:27,324 --> 01:36:28,617
<i>- That's a good plan.
- Yeah.</i>

1714
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:30,369
Have a way to change things.

1715
01:36:30,452 --> 01:36:32,704
And if you don't have them,

1716
01:36:32,788 --> 01:36:36,124
join with folks that are, um,

1717
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:39,544
actively trying to do those things.

1718
01:36:40,754 --> 01:36:43,090
<i>You see that shit?
What the fuck is that about?</i>

1719
01:36:43,173 --> 01:36:44,758
<i>What the fuck, man?</i>

1720
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:46,027
<i>That's what I'm talking about.</i>

1721
01:36:46,051 --> 01:36:49,763
And with mass organizations.

1722
01:36:53,392 --> 01:36:54,685
Spring Mansion.

1723
01:37:01,108 --> 01:37:03,428
<i>Security code cleared.</i>

1724
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:13,829
Fuck you, RegalView!
Fuck you, RegalView!

1725
01:37:13,912 --> 01:37:16,373
<i>None of the strikers here
at the RegalView strike</i>

1726
01:37:16,456 --> 01:37:18,041
<i>will tell us why they're all wearing</i>

1727
01:37:18,125 --> 01:37:21,628
<i>their Cola-and-smile-bitch wigs.</i>

1728
01:37:21,712 --> 01:37:24,381
<i>Although the strikers
have been extremely militant</i>

1729
01:37:24,464 --> 01:37:25,882
<i>over the past weeks,</i>

1730
01:37:25,966 --> 01:37:28,844
<i>they've not been able to stop
the Stackwater juggernaut</i>

1731
01:37:28,927 --> 01:37:30,971
<i>from breaking through the lines.</i>

1732
01:37:31,054 --> 01:37:33,682
<i>Scabs won't pass!
Scabs won't pass!</i>

1733
01:37:33,765 --> 01:37:35,058
<i>Scabs won't pass!</i>

1734
01:37:35,142 --> 01:37:36,476
When I shot the movie...

1735
01:37:38,145 --> 01:37:41,898
shooting everyone with the
and-smile-bitch wigs

1736
01:37:41,982 --> 01:37:44,234
was the time when I was like,
"Oh, my god,

1737
01:37:44,317 --> 01:37:47,112
we're making a very strange movie."

1738
01:37:54,578 --> 01:37:57,122
This is the one sequence

1739
01:37:57,205 --> 01:37:59,249
that I wish we had more time to shoot.

1740
01:37:59,332 --> 01:38:01,626
We didn't really, uh...

1741
01:38:02,794 --> 01:38:06,298
have the shots to build
the things we needed to.

1742
01:38:06,381 --> 01:38:09,301
We're telling the story
but, uh, in my mind,

1743
01:38:09,384 --> 01:38:11,428
I understand how we could

1744
01:38:11,511 --> 01:38:13,972
have made you feel the story

1745
01:38:14,056 --> 01:38:15,891
of that sequence a little bit more.

1746
01:38:17,309 --> 01:38:19,186
But who knows?
Maybe it would've opened up

1747
01:38:19,269 --> 01:38:22,147
a different can of worms
spending too much time on that.

1748
01:38:29,321 --> 01:38:31,323
<i>- Yeah, man!
- Yeah!</i>

1749
01:38:32,532 --> 01:38:34,326
Like I said, we were able to get...

1750
01:38:34,409 --> 01:38:37,120
we got so many people from Oakland...

1751
01:38:38,288 --> 01:38:39,706
in it.

1752
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:44,961
<i>Hup, hup, hup, hup,
hup, hup, hup, hup.</i>

1753
01:38:45,045 --> 01:38:47,589
<i>Looks like the cavalry has arrived, folks.</i>

1754
01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:49,067
<i>Hup, hup, hup, hup...</i>

1755
01:39:02,187 --> 01:39:04,397
Private mercenaries.

1756
01:39:04,481 --> 01:39:06,900
Private security, corporate security.

1757
01:39:06,983 --> 01:39:08,443
<i>Get the fuck back! Move!</i>

1758
01:39:08,527 --> 01:39:10,070
<i>This way. This way.</i>

1759
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:13,323
<i>Come on!</i>

1760
01:39:13,406 --> 01:39:14,991
<i>All right! All right!</i>

1761
01:39:18,829 --> 01:39:20,122
<i>Over here, over here.</i>

1762
01:39:24,167 --> 01:39:25,752
<i>This is when the magic happens.</i>

1763
01:39:25,836 --> 01:39:27,796
<i>Get them here quick!</i>

1764
01:39:30,298 --> 01:39:34,427
Right about... now,

1765
01:39:34,511 --> 01:39:38,056
you will hear the voice
of our editor, Terel Gibson.

1766
01:39:43,145 --> 01:39:44,604
Terel Gibson...

1767
01:39:49,276 --> 01:39:52,779
is... is an editor

1768
01:39:52,863 --> 01:39:57,742
whose name you will probably
start hearing a lot more of now.

1769
01:39:57,826 --> 01:40:02,414
He and I sat in a room
four days a week

1770
01:40:03,498 --> 01:40:06,710
for 10 hours a day...

1771
01:40:06,793 --> 01:40:08,086
<i>Let me out!</i>

1772
01:40:09,713 --> 01:40:11,381
For about...

1773
01:40:12,799 --> 01:40:16,636
uh, 10 weeks.

1774
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:18,597
Maybe 11 weeks including the time

1775
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:21,224
we went back and did stuff to it.

1776
01:40:24,936 --> 01:40:29,399
And each week he did
an extra day by himself

1777
01:40:29,482 --> 01:40:33,695
without me around to mess with him

1778
01:40:33,778 --> 01:40:35,947
because during that time...

1779
01:40:36,948 --> 01:40:38,491
Wait a minute. Yeah. Here we go.

1780
01:40:40,535 --> 01:40:45,248
Equisapiens coming to help out.

1781
01:40:45,332 --> 01:40:51,254
Anyway, um, during that time,
on those three-day weekends,

1782
01:40:51,338 --> 01:40:56,635
I was working on the soundtrack,
The Coup's portion of this.

1783
01:40:57,719 --> 01:40:58,759
And as you hear right now,

1784
01:40:58,803 --> 01:41:03,433
more beautiful score by Tune-Yards.

1785
01:41:03,516 --> 01:41:06,895
There are two musical worlds
in this movie.

1786
01:41:06,978 --> 01:41:08,396
One being the score,

1787
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:12,484
which is all the stuff
that the film is saying to you.

1788
01:41:14,069 --> 01:41:16,655
I guess we should talk
about the penises.

1789
01:41:18,615 --> 01:41:25,288
And for me,
it made it way more real...

1790
01:41:26,873 --> 01:41:29,960
to not have them covered up
right there.

1791
01:41:30,043 --> 01:41:31,503
To be wearing like the Hulk

1792
01:41:31,586 --> 01:41:33,922
or, like, a loin cloth
or something like that.

1793
01:41:34,005 --> 01:41:35,966
Then it becomes like
<i>Land of the Lost,</i>

1794
01:41:36,049 --> 01:41:38,134
Sleestaks,
or something like that.

1795
01:41:38,218 --> 01:41:41,805
But it made it feel more... much more human

1796
01:41:41,888 --> 01:41:43,598
to show genitals.

1797
01:41:44,849 --> 01:41:46,142
<i>WorryFree is here.</i>

1798
01:41:46,226 --> 01:41:48,395
<i>Hey, same struggle.</i>

1799
01:41:49,813 --> 01:41:52,691
You know,
to have them with tattoos

1800
01:41:52,774 --> 01:41:57,404
and things like that
that made you think of people.

1801
01:42:04,035 --> 01:42:05,620
And they're only men

1802
01:42:05,704 --> 01:42:07,664
because we only really had one suit.

1803
01:42:09,541 --> 01:42:10,541
<i>Hey.</i>

1804
01:42:13,169 --> 01:42:14,254
<i>Mastermind.</i>

1805
01:42:24,556 --> 01:42:31,229
I love this moment and the music
that Tune-Yards made for it,

1806
01:42:32,230 --> 01:42:34,941
which was kind of Brazilian inspired...

1807
01:42:35,942 --> 01:42:37,193
Or not Brazilian.

1808
01:42:39,362 --> 01:42:43,366
More like Italian inspired.

1809
01:42:43,450 --> 01:42:45,910
It didn't come out that way
but that's...

1810
01:42:45,994 --> 01:42:48,038
kind of where it seemed to come from.

1811
01:42:50,165 --> 01:42:51,416
<i>Are you serious right now?</i>

1812
01:42:51,499 --> 01:42:53,877
<i>Serious as cake in a can, man.</i>

1813
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:55,313
<i>Don't... don't play with me, Cash...</i>

1814
01:42:55,337 --> 01:42:56,939
This scene was actually
the first scene

1815
01:42:56,963 --> 01:43:01,843
that Jermaine Fowler
and Lakeith shot together.

1816
01:43:01,926 --> 01:43:04,429
They had just met each other,
like, 20 minutes before.

1817
01:43:06,598 --> 01:43:08,058
<i>Plus, I wanted to say I'm sorry.</i>

1818
01:43:09,351 --> 01:43:10,477
And...

1819
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:15,899
their connection
was so real right here.

1820
01:43:15,982 --> 01:43:17,525
<i>This is good. This</i> is...

1821
01:43:17,984 --> 01:43:21,446
I mean, in the sense that they open
themselves up to connect.

1822
01:43:23,365 --> 01:43:25,533
Because my whole thing was...

1823
01:43:25,617 --> 01:43:27,035
I almost took this scene out.

1824
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:29,829
I was like, "Wait a minute.
Maybe it doesn't make sense"

1825
01:43:29,913 --> 01:43:35,251
that he gives his...
he gives Sal this Maserati."

1826
01:43:35,335 --> 01:43:38,838
I said, "It doesn't make sense
unless they're like brothers."

1827
01:43:39,964 --> 01:43:42,550
Like, and you guys have
to really show us that."

1828
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:46,805
And so, that hug that they gave
really felt special,

1829
01:43:46,888 --> 01:43:49,391
and the way that they were
looking at each other.

1830
01:43:50,475 --> 01:43:51,726
<i>Kiss already, y'all.</i>

1831
01:44:01,111 --> 01:44:03,905
<i>So, what about being a part
of something important, huh?</i>

1832
01:44:03,988 --> 01:44:07,700
Here we have
the sun literally setting.

1833
01:44:09,202 --> 01:44:13,164
It's a beautiful happy ending
right now

1834
01:44:13,248 --> 01:44:15,917
that most movies would end at...

1835
01:44:17,710 --> 01:44:18,962
or some version of that.

1836
01:44:20,588 --> 01:44:24,467
Notice her earrings say
<i>Bella Ciao.</i>

1837
01:44:24,551 --> 01:44:26,803
Bella ciao is also a song lyric

1838
01:44:26,886 --> 01:44:31,558
of a famous Italian revolutionary song

1839
01:44:31,641 --> 01:44:33,685
that, uh, is about someone

1840
01:44:33,768 --> 01:44:36,438
going off to fight the fascists tomorrow,

1841
01:44:36,521 --> 01:44:38,857
and this is their last night together.

1842
01:44:42,652 --> 01:44:43,921
<i>What happened?</i>

1843
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:48,616
<i>What, Cash?</i>

1844
01:44:59,836 --> 01:45:02,630
Hmm. So maybe
Cassius is going off to fight.

1845
01:45:02,714 --> 01:45:05,300
That's my name. That's the title.

1846
01:45:23,526 --> 01:45:27,864
There are reasons that
Steve Lift is limping there.

1847
01:45:27,947 --> 01:45:30,158
<i>I'm Cassius Green
calling on behalf</i>

1848
01:45:30,241 --> 01:45:32,410
<i>of stomp-a-mud-hole
in-your-ass.com.</i>

1849
01:45:32,494 --> 01:45:34,037
<i>Sorry to bother you.</i>

1850
01:45:49,093 --> 01:45:53,181
That's the end.
Lakeith Stanfield, he's in it.

1851
01:45:53,264 --> 01:45:54,474
So is Tessa Thompson.

1852
01:45:56,184 --> 01:45:57,852
Jermaine Fowler's definitely in it.

1853
01:45:59,312 --> 01:46:00,855
Omari Hardwick's really in it.

1854
01:46:02,482 --> 01:46:03,733
Terry Crews.

1855
01:46:05,610 --> 01:46:07,487
Kate Berlant,
Michael X. Sommers.

1856
01:46:09,072 --> 01:46:10,823
Danny motherfucking Glover.

1857
01:46:11,824 --> 01:46:13,660
Steven Yeun, he smokes weed.

1858
01:46:14,661 --> 01:46:15,661
Armie Hammer.

1859
01:46:17,997 --> 01:46:20,458
That's me.
I wrote and directed it.

1860
01:46:20,542 --> 01:46:22,710
Nina Yang Bongiovi,
Forest Whitaker.

1861
01:46:24,170 --> 01:46:26,714
Charles King.
I'm just reading for you.

1862
01:46:26,798 --> 01:46:29,008
Produced by George Rush,
Jonathan Duffy,

1863
01:46:29,092 --> 01:46:30,843
and Kelly Williams.

1864
01:46:30,927 --> 01:46:33,805
Executive pro...
Oh, my god, it's going too fast.

1865
01:46:34,806 --> 01:46:36,933
I don't read fast or talk fast.

1866
01:46:37,016 --> 01:46:39,852
All these people really helped
make this movie happen.

1867
01:46:39,936 --> 01:46:43,815
Brian Benson. Doug Emmett,
Director of Photography.

1868
01:46:47,569 --> 01:46:49,779
Eyde Belasco, Terel Gibson.

1869
01:46:52,991 --> 01:46:55,159
Deirdra Elizabeth Govan. I didn't...

1870
01:46:55,243 --> 01:46:59,038
She does not use that word
in formal times.

1871
01:46:59,122 --> 01:47:01,082
She does not call herself
Deirdra Elizabeth

1872
01:47:01,165 --> 01:47:02,959
when you meet her in person.

1873
01:47:03,042 --> 01:47:04,335
I'm gonna ask her about that.

1874
01:47:05,712 --> 01:47:07,922
Annapurna Pictures.
They came and bought this

1875
01:47:08,006 --> 01:47:10,049
and put it out to the world.

1876
01:47:10,133 --> 01:47:13,303
This is why
you're now getting it on DVD

1877
01:47:13,386 --> 01:47:16,472
because you saw it
in a crowded theater of course.

1878
01:47:21,019 --> 01:47:24,397
All these folks really, um...

1879
01:47:26,608 --> 01:47:30,695
came and helped make
this dream come true.

1880
01:47:30,778 --> 01:47:33,615
It's something I worked on
for many years.

1881
01:47:33,698 --> 01:47:36,242
And, uh...

1882
01:47:36,326 --> 01:47:38,870
And many times told myself
it was gonna happen

1883
01:47:38,953 --> 01:47:41,956
but did not know whether
I was lying to myself or not.

1884
01:47:42,957 --> 01:47:47,712
And the movie,
as you have now seen,

1885
01:47:49,505 --> 01:47:54,260
is really different than other things

1886
01:47:54,344 --> 01:47:55,553
that are out there.

1887
01:47:55,637 --> 01:47:57,930
Script supervisor Andy Manners.

1888
01:47:58,014 --> 01:48:03,519
I have to say that definitely
first-time feature directors,

1889
01:48:03,603 --> 01:48:05,772
you're gonna lean
on your script supervisor.

1890
01:48:07,231 --> 01:48:09,776
They are the person who's like,

1891
01:48:09,859 --> 01:48:13,321
you know,
who you can at least rely on

1892
01:48:13,404 --> 01:48:14,947
to tell you the truth, like,

1893
01:48:15,031 --> 01:48:20,787
"Okay, you're gonna need...
you're gonna need another shot of this."

1894
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:26,417
Meaning, like, if you're worried
about any sort of coverage,

1895
01:48:26,501 --> 01:48:30,380
which, you know, being someone

1896
01:48:30,463 --> 01:48:34,133
who hadn't gone through
the editing process of a film,

1897
01:48:34,217 --> 01:48:36,260
um, it was good to have
someone like that

1898
01:48:36,344 --> 01:48:40,264
to make you feel like
you knew that you got it.

1899
01:48:40,348 --> 01:48:45,395
And so, give a shout-out
to Andy Manners.

1900
01:48:45,478 --> 01:48:48,815
There are many people
who are going by on this,

1901
01:48:48,898 --> 01:48:54,529
all... many of whom I love
and who helped make this happen

1902
01:48:54,612 --> 01:48:58,700
in really large ways.

1903
01:49:13,089 --> 01:49:15,133
This was not a movie that

1904
01:49:15,216 --> 01:49:17,927
many people thought
could get made,

1905
01:49:18,010 --> 01:49:19,010
you know.

1906
01:49:20,263 --> 01:49:24,100
And not only because
of the content,

1907
01:49:25,226 --> 01:49:27,186
which I didn't talk
a lot about right here

1908
01:49:27,270 --> 01:49:29,939
because you can probably see
any interview with me

1909
01:49:30,022 --> 01:49:33,818
and I'll talk your ear off
about the content of this.

1910
01:49:36,112 --> 01:49:40,783
But also because
of the narrative form,

1911
01:49:40,867 --> 01:49:45,496
and the, uh... idea

1912
01:49:45,580 --> 01:49:48,958
that it was doing multiple genres.

1913
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:53,296
And even though I don't really
think in those terms,

1914
01:49:54,380 --> 01:49:58,843
and that I hadn't ever done
a feature film before.

1915
01:49:58,926 --> 01:50:00,344
I did talk about how I...

1916
01:50:00,428 --> 01:50:04,056
I did sell people on the fact
that I had been to film school

1917
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:05,683
uh, twenty-something years ago,

1918
01:50:05,767 --> 01:50:08,644
but in reality, I didn't
remember any of that stuff.

1919
01:50:11,314 --> 01:50:14,525
But I did study hard
in between that time.

1920
01:50:15,651 --> 01:50:17,653
Thanks for watching this.

1921
01:50:17,737 --> 01:50:22,200
It's in memory of my mother
who died a few years ago,

1922
01:50:22,283 --> 01:50:23,451
Anitra Patterson,

1923
01:50:23,534 --> 01:50:26,412
and Pam the Funkstress,
The Coup's DJ,

1924
01:50:26,496 --> 01:50:28,706
who also died last year.

1925
01:50:31,876 --> 01:50:34,212
That's the title again. Thanks.
