1
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:31,334
Narrator: Nothing really
happens for a reason.

2
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:32,666
It just happens.

3
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:35,333
[moaning]

4
00:01:35,374 --> 00:01:36,708
[skyrockets whistling]

5
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,248
Narrator: Take when
Carol and I were kids.

6
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,540
On the night
of her fourth birthday...

7
00:01:44,749 --> 00:01:47,997
Narrator: Mom made us
birthday cake with our dinner.

8
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,581
It was early summer.
The air was balmy.

9
00:01:51,623 --> 00:01:52,747
Carol and I were twins,

10
00:01:52,788 --> 00:01:56,205
and the resemblance was
indeed strong at that age.

11
00:01:58,455 --> 00:02:00,621
Narrator: What was it that drew
mom to that window?

12
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,746
I think she must have
suspected dad's high jinx,

13
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:05,704
the way she grabbed us
and tore out of the house.

14
00:02:05,787 --> 00:02:08,411
[skyrockets whistling]

15
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,036
[firecracker explodes]

16
00:02:10,077 --> 00:02:12,453
Narrator: We crossed
the street hand-in-hand.

17
00:02:12,536 --> 00:02:14,952
It was an evening
of great beauty.

18
00:02:16,452 --> 00:02:17,744
[firecracker explodes]

19
00:02:18,577 --> 00:02:19,744
[firecracker explodes]

20
00:02:22,284 --> 00:02:24,242
What the hell's
going on here?

21
00:02:24,284 --> 00:02:25,451
Please...

22
00:02:25,493 --> 00:02:26,910
Yeah, Lou,
don't do it.

23
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:28,825
Aah!

24
00:02:29,658 --> 00:02:31,575
[woman screaming]

25
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:34,532
Narrator: It was funny.

26
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:37,782
It was funnier than
Charlie Chaplin or Krazy Kat.

27
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,240
The man on the floor didn't have
hardly any head at all,

28
00:02:40,324 --> 00:02:43,823
and dad and the woman,
they were naked.

29
00:02:43,907 --> 00:02:45,907
Dad went
to the electric chair,

30
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:47,865
and the woman
committed suicide.

31
00:02:47,907 --> 00:02:49,071
Mom was scarred for life,

32
00:02:49,155 --> 00:02:53,113
but they were naked
and it was funny.

33
00:02:55,404 --> 00:02:58,779
Narrator: It was so funny,
I remember--

34
00:02:58,821 --> 00:03:01,070
I remember that night well.

35
00:05:00,887 --> 00:05:02,928
Narrator:
The years went by.

36
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,761
Carol and I did what we said
we were going to do

37
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:05,928
back when we were kids.

38
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:08,260
We chose to marry someone
that no one else wanted--

39
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:11,051
Someone scorned
and shamed, cast aside.

40
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:12,051
Your favorite, honey.

41
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:13,051
Pot roast.

42
00:05:13,135 --> 00:05:15,593
Your son got
his report card today.

43
00:05:15,634 --> 00:05:16,634
Yeah?

44
00:05:16,718 --> 00:05:18,885
A "B" in deportment.

45
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:19,885
That's great.

46
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:21,508
Yeah, pa.

47
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:22,884
I gotta fly.

48
00:05:22,966 --> 00:05:24,550
I don't like it
when you go out this late

49
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:25,550
to cover stories.

50
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:26,842
The city never sleeps.

51
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:29,007
A reporter's gotta go
where the news is.

52
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,632
I'm gonna be into
something really big.

53
00:05:30,716 --> 00:05:32,883
It's dangerous what
you're up to, isn't it?

54
00:05:32,924 --> 00:05:34,549
I'll be careful, all right?
I'll be all right.

55
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,882
I love you so much.

56
00:05:35,964 --> 00:05:38,256
Take care of your mom
for me.

57
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:39,756
I will, pa.

58
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,256
Narrator: The way I played it,

59
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:43,422
the reporter racket
was a life-or-death gamble.

60
00:05:43,505 --> 00:05:45,255
When I hit Chicago
I had big plans

61
00:05:45,297 --> 00:05:47,755
on getting all the way
to the top.

62
00:05:47,797 --> 00:05:49,629
[playing blues music]

63
00:05:56,628 --> 00:05:58,378
Hey, Marty.

64
00:05:58,462 --> 00:06:00,253
Have a cigarette.

65
00:06:00,336 --> 00:06:02,795
Thanks.

66
00:06:02,837 --> 00:06:04,711
Nailing C.C. Casper,

67
00:06:04,752 --> 00:06:07,252
the top cop
in Chicago.

68
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:08,544
Tell me that doesn't
make your heart

69
00:06:08,627 --> 00:06:09,586
beat fast, Marty.

70
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,293
You got names,
dates and places

71
00:06:11,376 --> 00:06:13,084
for dope and
prostitution payoffs,

72
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:14,084
and your sources are solid?

73
00:06:14,168 --> 00:06:15,793
I know the drill, Marty.

74
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:19,125
I had your column
for five years, remember?

75
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:20,125
You know
better than anyone.

76
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:21,709
I can't go to print
until you go on tape

77
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:24,249
in front of McCalister
and the newspaper's lawyers.

78
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,624
I'm gonna make you
famous, Marty.

79
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,332
They'll be naming
streets after you.

80
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,957
Gonna make a movie
about you

81
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:31,832
starring
Marlon Brando.

82
00:06:31,874 --> 00:06:33,623
Not unless it's a musical.

83
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:36,165
All right, here's your end.

84
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:38,997
Liquid morphine,
the kind doctors use.

85
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,205
Administered judiciously,
this'll last you quite a while.

86
00:06:44,414 --> 00:06:45,830
You're too hungry, Joseph.

87
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:47,746
Pump too much of this pure,
it'll bury you.

88
00:06:47,788 --> 00:06:50,079
Do I look like I’m
in school, Marty?

89
00:06:50,163 --> 00:06:51,037
You give me
what I need,

90
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,495
I give you
what you need

91
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,787
and vice versa.

92
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,370
We're all gonna get fat
off this one, Joe.

93
00:06:56,454 --> 00:06:59,286
Now, if you'll excuse me,

94
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,994
I've got to go to confession.

95
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:03,703
Don't get lost.

96
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,868
Hey, joey.

97
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,784
Hey, hey, hey!

98
00:07:20,366 --> 00:07:23,741
Chief C.C. Casper
sends his regards.

99
00:07:23,783 --> 00:07:26,990
I don't know
any C.C. Casper.

100
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:28,240
Aw, come on, fellas.

101
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,407
Ohh!

102
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,365
Supposed to be
another guy here.

103
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:32,449
Marty somebody.

104
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:34,281
Ask him.

105
00:07:34,364 --> 00:07:35,989
[gasping]

106
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:41,155
Where's Marty?

107
00:07:41,196 --> 00:07:43,029
In the head.

108
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:09,776
Marty: You run into
a lot of jams in this life,

109
00:08:09,818 --> 00:08:12,234
but what you don't want is some
trigger-happy Chicago cops

110
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:15,316
trying to put your lights out.

111
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:18,567
Where'd he go?

112
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,525
Go that way.

113
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,357
Marty: Three years of work
in Chicago up in smoke

114
00:08:23,441 --> 00:08:24,566
in one night.

115
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:26,357
The dirty cops
and the corrupt politicians

116
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,231
who ran the city weren't ready
to let a reporter get away

117
00:08:29,273 --> 00:08:31,731
with blowing the lid off
their entire operation.

118
00:08:44,646 --> 00:08:46,646
Marty: Now I had to spring
for safe territory,

119
00:08:46,688 --> 00:08:48,020
and in a hurry.

120
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,643
Next pit stop
is Wichita, Kansas.

121
00:09:06,726 --> 00:09:10,643
If you gotta take
a leak, do it now.

122
00:09:12,225 --> 00:09:13,725
Marty: I headed
for California,

123
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:16,892
where mom and my sister
Carol had landed.

124
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:21,349
Carol's marriage to a rich
lowlife, William Wharton II,

125
00:09:21,433 --> 00:09:23,307
hadn't worked out so well.

126
00:09:23,391 --> 00:09:26,432
Now she was looking
after mom.

127
00:09:30,807 --> 00:09:33,222
Mom had stopped moving
for a while.

128
00:09:33,264 --> 00:09:34,514
Not because
she was content,

129
00:09:34,556 --> 00:09:37,806
but because she was
too tired to go on.

130
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,304
The cab fare
came to 95 cents.

131
00:09:43,388 --> 00:09:45,928
I had a total
of $2.00 in my pocket,

132
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,429
which I gave
to the cab driver.

133
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,928
[dog barking]

134
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,927
It did not matter
about being broke.

135
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:55,469
Carol and I
were together again

136
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,761
after three long years,

137
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:59,344
the longest
we'd been separated.

138
00:10:00,343 --> 00:10:02,343
Nothing else
seemed to matter.

139
00:10:05,093 --> 00:10:07,217
Marty.

140
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:08,717
Come in.

141
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:10,050
Come in.

142
00:10:17,966 --> 00:10:19,216
Well...

143
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:22,298
Let me look at you.

144
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,632
You can look at me, Ma.

145
00:10:24,715 --> 00:10:28,131
You can look at me
till the cows come home.

146
00:10:28,172 --> 00:10:29,131
I don't believe it.

147
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:32,673
You're just handsomer
than you used to be.

148
00:10:32,756 --> 00:10:34,131
You don't look a day
older yourself, Ma.

149
00:10:34,172 --> 00:10:35,130
Where is Carol?

150
00:10:35,171 --> 00:10:36,755
Where is that redheaded
sister of mine?

151
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,004
I made you breakfast.

152
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:40,213
She's still in bed,
isn't she?

153
00:10:40,296 --> 00:10:42,087
I've got it all ready.

154
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,504
Which room is hers?

155
00:10:43,546 --> 00:10:44,754
Well, but...

156
00:10:44,838 --> 00:10:47,045
Well, why don't you
eat your breakfast first?

157
00:10:47,087 --> 00:10:49,253
'Cause I know you must be
tired and hungry.

158
00:10:49,294 --> 00:10:51,128
Listen,
I’ve got it special.

159
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:52,128
I made everything

160
00:10:52,211 --> 00:10:53,128
just the way
you like it.

161
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:54,420
Mom.

162
00:10:55,293 --> 00:10:58,335
She's at the top
of the stairs

163
00:10:58,419 --> 00:11:01,043
next to the bathroom.

164
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,167
Marty.

165
00:11:03,251 --> 00:11:04,501
Now, this time,

166
00:11:04,584 --> 00:11:06,042
now, you and Carol

167
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:07,876
aren't going to get
into trouble.

168
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,375
Trouble?

169
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,875
That's a little unfair, mom.

170
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:13,958
What made you think

171
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,875
that we'd have gotten
into any trouble?

172
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,541
Now you listen to me.

173
00:11:17,624 --> 00:11:19,666
I want you to get a job.

174
00:11:19,707 --> 00:11:21,582
You could do it.
I know you can.

175
00:11:21,624 --> 00:11:23,456
There's three papers
in town.

176
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,081
You just--
with your expertise

177
00:11:25,123 --> 00:11:27,581
and your experience
and talent and...

178
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:29,997
Looks.

179
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,996
Ma, you're...

180
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,705
You're gonna get me
blushing again,

181
00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:33,913
aren't you?

182
00:11:33,955 --> 00:11:34,913
And I want you

183
00:11:34,955 --> 00:11:36,163
to bring your family
out right away, too.

184
00:11:36,247 --> 00:11:38,538
Why don't we just stop
right here, OK?

185
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:40,204
Let's just stop
right here, mother.

186
00:11:40,287 --> 00:11:42,788
Just to set up
your own household.

187
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,994
Mother,
I’m a big boy now.

188
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,537
You will do it,
won't you?

189
00:11:51,285 --> 00:11:52,452
Marty.

190
00:11:52,536 --> 00:11:55,910
You won't stay here a day
longer than you have to.

191
00:11:55,952 --> 00:11:58,243
I know you don't
mean that, mother.

192
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,701
It almost sounds
as though

193
00:12:00,743 --> 00:12:01,992
I'm not welcome
here, though.

194
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:05,242
Marty: I looked at her
with genuine sorrow.

195
00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:07,409
It's rather sad, you know,
when one's own mother fears

196
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,158
or even dislikes him.

197
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:10,659
It was almost unbearable.

198
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,616
I say this as one who's done
a great deal of bearing.

199
00:12:13,658 --> 00:12:16,825
It's just that I got old.

200
00:12:16,907 --> 00:12:21,323
And I can't take the trouble
so good anymore like I used to.

201
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,698
As if you ever could.

202
00:12:30,823 --> 00:12:32,072
Marty: Any time
I was away from her,

203
00:12:32,114 --> 00:12:33,655
it felt too long.

204
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:36,613
Especially
when I saw her again.

205
00:12:36,696 --> 00:12:38,780
Was she asleep

206
00:12:38,863 --> 00:12:41,445
or was she
playing possum?

207
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:08,024
Mr. Martin Lakewood.

208
00:13:08,108 --> 00:13:12,566
Mrs. Carol
Lakewood Wharton.

209
00:13:16,357 --> 00:13:18,357
Sister.

210
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,981
Brother.

211
00:13:40,604 --> 00:13:42,770
[Carol laughing]

212
00:13:43,894 --> 00:13:46,894
"once upon a time
there was a little boy,

213
00:13:46,936 --> 00:13:49,019
there was
a little girl..."

214
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:54,394
I tell you, this Monroe dame
sure gets a lot of ink.

215
00:13:54,477 --> 00:13:57,309
No wonder
I can't make a buck.

216
00:13:57,393 --> 00:13:59,851
Guys all expect girls
to have tits a mile wide.

217
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:01,059
She's ruining it
for all of us.

218
00:14:01,142 --> 00:14:02,226
Mom: Marty, Carol,
breakfast.

219
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:04,891
God damn her anyway.

220
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:06,974
I'm gonna slap the hell
out of her in a minute.

221
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:08,809
I will, Marty.

222
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,682
I'm sorry.
I'm not laughing at you.

223
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:14,516
Marty: I had reason to know
her threats were not idle.

224
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:15,808
Still, I was amused.

225
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,223
It was so incongruous to me.

226
00:14:18,264 --> 00:14:20,431
Such words from such
a sweet-faced doll.

227
00:14:20,473 --> 00:14:23,681
Maybe I’m losing
my sense of humor.

228
00:14:23,765 --> 00:14:25,138
If I sleep with
one more sailor,

229
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,888
I'll start saluting.

230
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:30,970
So, Marty, what is this
beef in Chicago about?

231
00:14:31,012 --> 00:14:32,887
Mom saw the clippings
that you sent.

232
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,970
She went on a rampage.

233
00:14:34,012 --> 00:14:36,012
I had the good fortune
to ferret out

234
00:14:36,096 --> 00:14:37,638
some smelly
figurative bodies

235
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,845
to identify the officeholders
responsible for them

236
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:42,553
and the bigwigs who ran
the whole Sheboygan.

237
00:14:42,637 --> 00:14:44,762
Will you give me
a ciga--

238
00:14:49,844 --> 00:14:52,093
Then it turned out
that no one was ready

239
00:14:52,134 --> 00:14:53,593
to back my play.

240
00:14:53,635 --> 00:14:55,593
The voters and my editor

241
00:14:55,676 --> 00:14:56,843
and the people
who ran things

242
00:14:56,926 --> 00:14:57,926
all thought it was
just plain peachy

243
00:14:57,967 --> 00:15:00,759
to let those dirty thieves
keep their jobs.

244
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:02,550
I know, sweetie.

245
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:05,133
You try
lighting a candle

246
00:15:05,175 --> 00:15:07,132
while everyone else
is cursing the darkness.

247
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:09,007
How'd you let yourself
get into such hot water?

248
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:10,174
Marty: It was a question
I couldn't answer.

249
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:12,049
Had I subconsciously
wanted the heat?

250
00:15:12,132 --> 00:15:16,048
Had I brought about
my own downfall?

251
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,799
Maybe time would take
care of her and me, too.

252
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:19,714
Unless, of course,
we changed,

253
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:23,255
but how could we do that?

254
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:26,339
Marty.

255
00:15:28,588 --> 00:15:30,004
Marty:
from the time we were kids,

256
00:15:30,088 --> 00:15:32,421
carol and I couldn't stay
out of trouble.

257
00:15:32,463 --> 00:15:35,003
The kids we grew up with
were cousins and second cousins

258
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:36,087
and friends of cousins.

259
00:15:36,128 --> 00:15:38,212
They all called us
strange and different.

260
00:15:38,295 --> 00:15:40,503
Hey, Carol!

261
00:15:41,378 --> 00:15:42,544
Hey!

262
00:15:42,628 --> 00:15:44,461
Hey, cousin Lyle.

263
00:15:44,503 --> 00:15:47,543
Marty: And they were right.
We were.

264
00:15:47,585 --> 00:15:49,001
We felt
each other's feelings,

265
00:15:49,043 --> 00:15:51,502
we thought each other's
thoughts.

266
00:15:51,543 --> 00:15:53,418
We didn't care
what anyone thought of us

267
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:55,542
and that was unforgivable.

268
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:57,667
For that,
we had to be punished.

269
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,916
Tim, you all set?

270
00:16:01,957 --> 00:16:03,750
Yeah.

271
00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:06,166
Come on, help me, guys.

272
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:07,625
Let go!

273
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,873
Marty!

274
00:16:09,956 --> 00:16:11,123
Stop that!

275
00:16:11,165 --> 00:16:12,499
Carol: Marty!

276
00:16:12,582 --> 00:16:14,457
Marty!

277
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:17,039
Marty!

278
00:16:17,914 --> 00:16:19,831
Marty!

279
00:16:19,872 --> 00:16:21,039
Marty!

280
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:24,246
Marty!
Get off of me!

281
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,663
Let go of me!

282
00:16:25,705 --> 00:16:26,663
Let go of me!

283
00:16:26,705 --> 00:16:27,954
Marty!

284
00:16:28,038 --> 00:16:29,870
Kill 'em!

285
00:16:29,912 --> 00:16:31,704
Get 'em!

286
00:16:31,746 --> 00:16:34,371
Marty: And there was
something wrong, of course:

287
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:37,828
The deepest, darkest crime
two people could ever commit.

288
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:40,328
We loved each other.
It was a lesson

289
00:16:40,411 --> 00:16:42,453
I was ever trying
to hammer home to sis.

290
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:45,327
You may be wrong
and exist comfortably

291
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,868
in a world of righteousness,

292
00:16:46,951 --> 00:16:47,868
but you may not be right

293
00:16:47,951 --> 00:16:49,951
and live
in a world of error--

294
00:16:49,993 --> 00:16:52,493
The kind of world
that we seemed to live in.

295
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:53,950
The growing sense
of injustice

296
00:16:54,034 --> 00:16:55,785
would just be
too much to bear.

297
00:16:55,867 --> 00:16:57,742
You know how
you and me look

298
00:16:57,825 --> 00:16:59,784
on those things,
Carol.

299
00:16:59,866 --> 00:17:03,075
What we endured was
something normal for us,

300
00:17:03,116 --> 00:17:04,407
for those
particular times

301
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:06,449
and those particular
situations.

302
00:17:06,532 --> 00:17:09,865
It's just
what happened.

303
00:17:09,948 --> 00:17:11,239
We weren't
mistreated.

304
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:12,740
Here, Marty,
I want you to take this.

305
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,281
I insist.

306
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:15,281
I know you're broke,

307
00:17:15,365 --> 00:17:17,073
so you take what you
need out of that,

308
00:17:17,114 --> 00:17:19,238
and you send the rest
to Glenda and Junior.

309
00:17:19,322 --> 00:17:20,322
You said
things were tough.

310
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:22,364
There's well over
three centuries here.

311
00:17:22,447 --> 00:17:23,655
So?

312
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:25,196
$300 isn't a lot of money.

313
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,196
Not when you've been around
the guys I’ve been around.

314
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:30,196
So there's that alimony
that stiff pays you.

315
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,571
You can make the rent
off of that.

316
00:17:31,654 --> 00:17:32,986
Did you say mom's doctor
bills were getting high?

317
00:17:33,028 --> 00:17:34,986
Jesus, what are you,
an auditor all of a sudden?

318
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,362
Such a fuss over
a couple hundred dollars.

319
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:37,944
Baby, don't keep me
in the dark.

320
00:17:38,028 --> 00:17:39,319
Give me
the straight dope.

321
00:17:39,402 --> 00:17:43,694
You see, Marty, I have been
saving up for something.

322
00:17:43,736 --> 00:17:45,984
Um, just a couple dollars
at a time.

323
00:17:46,068 --> 00:17:47,068
Why didn't you say so?

324
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:48,777
Because I know you.

325
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,443
I know that if you knew
that I needed--

326
00:17:51,485 --> 00:17:54,233
That I wanted the money
for myself, that--

327
00:17:54,317 --> 00:17:56,484
Marty: I saw something
in her face I didn't like.

328
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:58,067
Baby, what is it
you want?

329
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,317
Marty: I couldn't
analyze the expression

330
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,608
or say why
it troubled me.

331
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:03,899
A mink. But I don't have
to have that, Marty.

332
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,358
Anyway,
now that you're here,

333
00:18:05,441 --> 00:18:06,690
we're gonna be rolling
in the money soon.

334
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:08,231
Right?

335
00:18:09,148 --> 00:18:10,231
Yeah.

336
00:18:10,315 --> 00:18:12,106
See?

337
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,814
So, you satisfied now, huh?

338
00:18:13,897 --> 00:18:15,064
Yeah, I’m satisfied.

339
00:18:15,105 --> 00:18:16,356
You still haven't
leveled with me

340
00:18:16,397 --> 00:18:17,689
on how you're
making it

341
00:18:17,773 --> 00:18:18,897
with the local
syndicate, though.

342
00:18:18,938 --> 00:18:20,730
Oh, these guys are
such a laughable crew,

343
00:18:20,772 --> 00:18:21,813
you could hardly believe it.

344
00:18:21,896 --> 00:18:23,646
Marty: She told me how
she staked out some turf

345
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,355
in the local
cocktail lounge

346
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:29,645
when they sent some joy boy
around to give her the arm.

347
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:31,895
I'll have a Rob Roy,
please.

348
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:38,186
Ahem. You're sorta cute.

349
00:18:39,728 --> 00:18:40,935
You're not.

350
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,851
What's your name,
sweetcheeks?

351
00:18:42,893 --> 00:18:44,310
Who's asking?

352
00:18:44,393 --> 00:18:45,851
Name's Lloyd.

353
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:48,809
I run this joint for
the McCloud outfit.

354
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:51,768
Lloyd, huh?

355
00:18:52,768 --> 00:18:54,809
Lloyd, why don't you
run home to mama

356
00:18:54,892 --> 00:18:56,891
and have her make you
some hot milk?

357
00:18:56,932 --> 00:18:58,516
You can't sell that
pretty ass of yours

358
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,641
around this town
without us taking a cut.

359
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:02,640
[sizzle]

360
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,307
Aah!

361
00:19:08,307 --> 00:19:11,847
Lloyd, the next time McCloud
wants to talk to me,

362
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,181
have him see me in person.

363
00:19:13,264 --> 00:19:14,306
[gagging]

364
00:19:14,348 --> 00:19:15,306
Oh, what's that?

365
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:19,055
He says he'll buy
my drink for me.

366
00:19:20,722 --> 00:19:22,680
[gagging]

367
00:19:29,763 --> 00:19:31,553
Carol: So the two big guns,

368
00:19:31,595 --> 00:19:33,595
mcCloud
and his partner Galloway,

369
00:19:33,636 --> 00:19:35,428
they come out to the house.

370
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:40,010
And I fixed them both
a nice, big drink.

371
00:19:45,343 --> 00:19:47,009
Can you imagine?

372
00:19:47,092 --> 00:19:49,551
They gulped it down
like little lambs.

373
00:19:49,593 --> 00:19:51,383
[laughs]

374
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:52,717
[sighs]

375
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:56,342
I do believe they've never
heard of chloral hydrate.

376
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:26,628
Carol: It took
the highway patrol

377
00:20:26,712 --> 00:20:29,337
A whole week to find them.

378
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,086
One of them died,

379
00:20:32,128 --> 00:20:34,835
and one of them
had to be committed

380
00:20:34,918 --> 00:20:37,085
to the insane asylum.

381
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:40,376
Couldn't have happened
to a nicer pair of guys.

382
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:45,293
And since then...

383
00:20:45,335 --> 00:20:47,584
Nobody seems
to muscle me anymore.

384
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,208
That's my sis.

385
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:50,833
That's my sweet
little sister.

386
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,000
Ha ha!

387
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,166
Marty: I went to work
the following day

388
00:20:54,249 --> 00:20:56,291
on the first paper
I applied to.

389
00:20:56,374 --> 00:20:58,124
I had no difficulty
about it.

390
00:20:58,207 --> 00:21:00,291
Not since I was a child,
a very small child,

391
00:21:00,374 --> 00:21:02,873
have I had any difficulty
in getting work.

392
00:21:02,956 --> 00:21:05,081
It would be strange
if I did.

393
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:06,873
Personably
and in intelligence,

394
00:21:06,914 --> 00:21:08,872
I'm a generous cut
above the average.

395
00:21:08,913 --> 00:21:12,331
I must admit to this,
as immodest as it seems.

396
00:21:12,414 --> 00:21:13,664
When I choose to,

397
00:21:13,748 --> 00:21:16,871
I can be exceedingly
ingratiating.

398
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:20,038
And to top it off,

399
00:21:20,121 --> 00:21:24,454
there was my childhood training
by earnest teachers.

400
00:21:24,495 --> 00:21:25,911
One gets work readily

401
00:21:25,995 --> 00:21:28,661
when the penalty for failure
was a clubbing.

402
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:31,910
You learn not to take no
for an answer.

403
00:21:34,036 --> 00:21:36,035
It was the best
and biggest paper in town,

404
00:21:36,076 --> 00:21:37,410
which is not to say,
of course,

405
00:21:37,493 --> 00:21:39,702
that it was either
very good or very big.

406
00:21:39,744 --> 00:21:41,660
Most of the other staffers
were fair,

407
00:21:41,744 --> 00:21:43,617
about average, I suppose.

408
00:21:43,701 --> 00:21:46,451
They'd been getting by nicely
until I came along.

409
00:21:46,534 --> 00:21:48,451
But then there I was--

410
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:51,450
A real newspaperman,
a towering beacon of ability,

411
00:21:51,491 --> 00:21:52,700
and by comparison,

412
00:21:52,783 --> 00:21:56,240
these average people
looked like submoronic dolts.

413
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,864
Marty: Whenever I cared to,

414
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,905
and when I had an amusing
objective in mind,

415
00:22:05,989 --> 00:22:08,156
I've always advanced
in my work.

416
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:10,322
But I set an all-time record
on the paper.

417
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:12,946
I was assistant city editor
at the end of the first week.

418
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,530
Two weeks later,
I made city editor.

419
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,945
Marty:
Carol, on the other hand,

420
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:22,779
had a different experience
of employment.

421
00:22:22,862 --> 00:22:25,570
Being sorely undernourished
and frequently raped,

422
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:27,819
she had little energy,
time, or appetite

423
00:22:27,902 --> 00:22:29,653
for normal endeavors.

424
00:22:31,777 --> 00:22:34,652
[horn honks]

425
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:40,109
Marty: While I was
going up the ladder,

426
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:43,359
sis was doing her level best
to make change.

427
00:22:45,734 --> 00:22:47,275
Man: Now.

428
00:22:50,358 --> 00:22:53,815
Marty: My rise at the sentinel
did not bring joy to all.

429
00:22:53,898 --> 00:22:55,566
In fact,
the city room was a mess.

430
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,441
All the staffers were jumpy.

431
00:22:57,482 --> 00:22:59,523
The news editor
had resigned.

432
00:22:59,606 --> 00:23:02,356
The chief copy editor
had reverted to alcoholism.

433
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,273
The publisher no longer made
his face to shine upon them.

434
00:23:05,315 --> 00:23:07,647
He griped at everyone,
except me.

435
00:23:07,689 --> 00:23:10,022
No one could do anything
to please him,

436
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:11,480
except me.

437
00:23:14,104 --> 00:23:16,104
Mr. Griffith
wants to see you.

438
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:17,730
Yes.

439
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:27,102
Griffith:
uh, have a seat, Marty.

440
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:28,561
Thanks, Mr. Griffith.

441
00:23:29,977 --> 00:23:32,935
You know, I, uh, canned,
uh, Samuelson.

442
00:23:32,977 --> 00:23:35,643
The managing editor.
Yeah, I heard about that.

443
00:23:35,727 --> 00:23:37,768
Seemed like an OK Joe.

444
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:39,768
I guess you had
your reasons.

445
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:42,309
The job is yours,
if you want it.

446
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,726
Gee.

447
00:23:44,808 --> 00:23:49,433
You're getting
$75 a week.

448
00:23:49,516 --> 00:23:50,725
Well, that goes up.

449
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:52,849
$82.50.

450
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,973
Samuelson always
treated me square.

451
00:23:55,056 --> 00:23:57,181
He was a bum.

452
00:23:57,223 --> 00:23:59,140
He couldn't turn
this rag around.

453
00:23:59,223 --> 00:24:00,473
You can.

454
00:24:00,557 --> 00:24:02,764
You know it.
I know it.

455
00:24:02,847 --> 00:24:04,431
Start today.

456
00:24:04,514 --> 00:24:05,764
I quit.

457
00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:07,764
What?

458
00:24:07,805 --> 00:24:09,638
You're sick of paying
Samuelson $112.50

459
00:24:09,722 --> 00:24:11,305
To do his job?

460
00:24:11,346 --> 00:24:13,846
Looking for the next patsy
to hang this rag on?

461
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:14,971
No, thanks.

462
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:17,053
If you were half smart,
you'd have talked to me

463
00:24:17,137 --> 00:24:19,095
before you gave Samuelson
the knife, but you're not.

464
00:24:19,178 --> 00:24:20,304
Are you crazy?

465
00:24:20,345 --> 00:24:22,344
Not crazy enough to keep
eating your shit.

466
00:24:22,386 --> 00:24:24,428
You can't just
walk out on me--

467
00:24:24,511 --> 00:24:27,428
Yes! Yes! I can!

468
00:24:27,511 --> 00:24:29,884
I have a guideline
for my behavior!

469
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:30,926
And you, sir,

470
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,468
you have violated
commandment one-minus!

471
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:35,302
What the hell are you
talking about?

472
00:24:35,385 --> 00:24:37,092
It is the commandment that
has never been written down

473
00:24:37,134 --> 00:24:39,759
because every goddamn fool's
supposed to know it!

474
00:24:39,842 --> 00:24:40,759
Yea, verily...

475
00:24:40,842 --> 00:24:43,675
It is the pointed moral
of all happening

476
00:24:43,758 --> 00:24:46,425
from the beginning
of creation to wit.

477
00:24:46,466 --> 00:24:48,174
Take not advantage
of thy neighbor

478
00:24:48,258 --> 00:24:49,466
with his pants down,

479
00:24:49,508 --> 00:24:52,007
for to each man,
there comes this season!

480
00:24:52,048 --> 00:24:54,840
And in my house,
there are many mansions!

481
00:24:54,881 --> 00:24:56,299
And in those mansions,

482
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,589
there are many men
longer-donged than thyself.

483
00:25:03,047 --> 00:25:04,547
Get out!

484
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:07,422
Get--get--get out!

485
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:08,547
Get out!

486
00:25:08,588 --> 00:25:10,005
Get out! Get out!

487
00:25:10,088 --> 00:25:12,170
Get out! Get out!
Get out!

488
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:15,962
Marty: I'd like to say
I walked out on that dog prick

489
00:25:16,004 --> 00:25:18,461
because he was
a wicked old man.

490
00:25:19,586 --> 00:25:22,211
The truth: It was
his being certain about me

491
00:25:22,295 --> 00:25:24,336
and my motives
that I objected to.

492
00:25:24,378 --> 00:25:26,002
The minute anybody
thinks they have me,

493
00:25:26,043 --> 00:25:28,127
thinks they know
what makes me tick,

494
00:25:28,168 --> 00:25:29,711
I have to take 'em down.

495
00:25:29,793 --> 00:25:31,043
Nobody knows me.

496
00:25:31,127 --> 00:25:32,751
I do what I do,

497
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:34,167
and that's it.

498
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,501
But the world
hadn't changed.

499
00:25:38,543 --> 00:25:41,166
I still
had to turn a buck.

500
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,750
Carol's luck
was running bad.

501
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:46,165
There was no prize chump
in the offing.

502
00:25:46,249 --> 00:25:48,957
But what the hell,
I thought.

503
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,541
We were bound to get a break
before too long.

504
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,498
In point of fact,

505
00:25:58,581 --> 00:26:01,414
opportunity was walking
right in my direction.

506
00:26:30,285 --> 00:26:32,660
Well, it if isn't
Alice Blueclothes.

507
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:36,158
Boo, pretty Alice.

508
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,617
Please let go of me.

509
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:42,865
I don't think so.

510
00:26:44,032 --> 00:26:45,907
What's the matter?
Don't you like me?

511
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:47,991
Let go of me, or I’ll
fix you, you see?

512
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:50,073
Oh, come on. We haven't even
had our waltz yet, Alice.

513
00:26:50,115 --> 00:26:51,407
Or would you prefer
a square dance?

514
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,407
We could ask these nice people
to join in right with us.

515
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,156
Are you gonna
lay off me, or what?

516
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,947
You're so nice to the touch,
I don't think I am.

517
00:26:56,989 --> 00:26:59,863
Besides, what are you
gonna do about it?

518
00:27:03,113 --> 00:27:05,738
Police officer.
You're under arrest.

519
00:27:05,821 --> 00:27:08,613
I will go,
willingly, gladly.

520
00:27:08,655 --> 00:27:10,654
Lock me up in some cool,
dark place,

521
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:12,320
use handcuffs,
but you know what?

522
00:27:12,362 --> 00:27:16,152
You're gonna have to
put 'em on yourself.

523
00:27:20,695 --> 00:27:22,111
OK. All right, mister,

524
00:27:22,194 --> 00:27:24,568
I should take you in,
but I’m off duty,

525
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,360
and I got better ways
to spend my free time.

526
00:27:26,402 --> 00:27:27,610
Is this your car, Alice?

527
00:27:27,694 --> 00:27:28,943
You know,
it matches your blush.

528
00:27:28,985 --> 00:27:31,609
Shut up! If you don't
promise to behave yourself,

529
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:32,984
I'll take you in anyway.

530
00:27:33,067 --> 00:27:35,025
The body matches
your lines, too.

531
00:27:35,109 --> 00:27:36,276
[sighs]

532
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:42,149
Are you blond all over
or just where it shows?

533
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:48,940
[horn honks]

534
00:27:49,023 --> 00:27:50,565
[horn honks]

535
00:27:55,398 --> 00:27:58,146
Would you just
please go away?

536
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,480
Sure, I will, Alice.

537
00:27:59,563 --> 00:28:02,938
Say it like you mean it,
and I will.

538
00:28:03,021 --> 00:28:07,271
I'll go away, and you'll never
see me again. Scout's honor.

539
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:10,229
[horn honks]

540
00:28:13,728 --> 00:28:16,852
Do you--
do you want--ahem.

541
00:28:16,936 --> 00:28:18,061
We could--

542
00:28:18,144 --> 00:28:19,977
What is it, dear?
Spit it out.

543
00:28:20,018 --> 00:28:22,893
We could go somewhere,
for a drink.

544
00:28:22,977 --> 00:28:24,519
I'm afraid not.

545
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,726
As a matter of fact,
I wouldn't think of it.

546
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:29,226
I know something of your city,
and I know that cops on duty--

547
00:28:29,268 --> 00:28:30,601
No. I told you
I’m not on duty.

548
00:28:30,685 --> 00:28:32,891
And I’m not sure
I believe you.

549
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:34,183
And I know something else.

550
00:28:34,267 --> 00:28:36,975
Local lady cops
have to be single.

551
00:28:37,058 --> 00:28:39,100
Marriage is grounds
for immediate dismissal.

552
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:41,974
And one would
also be dismissed,

553
00:28:42,015 --> 00:28:43,557
naturally and quite promptly,

554
00:28:43,641 --> 00:28:46,140
if her behavior was slightly
less than circumspect.

555
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,973
I mean, she can't sleep around
as other women may.

556
00:28:49,056 --> 00:28:51,056
One hint of scandal,
and she'd be caught.

557
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:53,181
But guy cops,
they can fuck all they want

558
00:28:53,223 --> 00:28:54,430
or anyone they want.

559
00:28:54,514 --> 00:28:55,846
What's a lady to do?

560
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,888
I mean, what is she to do

561
00:28:57,972 --> 00:29:01,596
if her womanly desires
were, shall we say,

562
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,471
A little more extreme
than normal ones?

563
00:29:03,554 --> 00:29:06,346
If she was highly sexed,

564
00:29:06,388 --> 00:29:09,178
loaded with all
the right equipment,

565
00:29:09,262 --> 00:29:12,011
just aching
for a little action,

566
00:29:12,095 --> 00:29:13,512
what then?

567
00:29:26,051 --> 00:29:30,008
I'm sorry, you're
gonna have to speak up.

568
00:29:30,092 --> 00:29:32,217
We could go to my place.

569
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:35,383
Yeah. I'd like
to see your house.

570
00:29:35,466 --> 00:29:37,049
I hate taking women
to hotels.

571
00:29:37,091 --> 00:29:40,716
No. No, no. I meant
we could go to my place

572
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,674
and have dinner, and
we could talk, and...

573
00:29:43,756 --> 00:29:45,340
It's right on the beach.

574
00:29:45,423 --> 00:29:46,798
We could swim
if you want.

575
00:29:46,881 --> 00:29:48,548
I'd love to do all
those things. Really.

576
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:51,130
That would be fantastic.
We can do all that after.

577
00:29:51,172 --> 00:29:52,755
I mean,
we'll go to bed first,

578
00:29:52,797 --> 00:29:54,673
and then if you're
not too tired,

579
00:29:54,755 --> 00:29:56,338
you can make supper.

580
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:58,380
We can take a walk
on the beach.

581
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,672
Heck, we could even talk.

582
00:30:01,588 --> 00:30:03,712
You don't like
the sound of that?

583
00:30:03,795 --> 00:30:04,712
That's all right.

584
00:30:04,795 --> 00:30:05,795
I can take a walk
up this block,

585
00:30:05,878 --> 00:30:06,962
meet half a dozen women

586
00:30:07,045 --> 00:30:08,379
who'd like the sound
of what I just proposed.

587
00:30:08,462 --> 00:30:09,545
I know you could.

588
00:30:09,629 --> 00:30:12,544
I say we just
forget it, huh?

589
00:30:13,503 --> 00:30:15,752
Oh, but afterwards,

590
00:30:15,835 --> 00:30:17,710
you wouldn't respect me.

591
00:30:17,751 --> 00:30:21,043
I couldn't
respect myself.

592
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:23,335
You'd think
I was terrible.

593
00:30:24,584 --> 00:30:26,875
You are so wrong.

594
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:28,626
Marty: I really
didn't care, you know.

595
00:30:28,709 --> 00:30:30,376
At least,
I cared very little.

596
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:32,166
She was a cop.

597
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:34,625
Of course, there was a cop
that dad had killed.

598
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:37,416
I wasn't sure that I cared
to do anything about that.

599
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,624
Wait, sir.

600
00:30:39,707 --> 00:30:41,457
Mister, wait up.

601
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,207
Just wait up, OK?

602
00:30:45,206 --> 00:30:47,206
Don't you go away.

603
00:30:47,248 --> 00:30:50,206
I want you to come home
with me right now.

604
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:51,206
Oh, should I?

605
00:30:51,248 --> 00:30:54,163
Yes. Just come home
with me right now.

606
00:30:54,247 --> 00:30:55,247
Come now.

607
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:57,288
I don't know. I mean,
what'll you think of me?

608
00:30:57,372 --> 00:30:58,538
You'll think
I’m terrible.

609
00:30:58,622 --> 00:31:00,954
You just better come home
with me right now,

610
00:31:00,995 --> 00:31:03,162
or I’ll do it right here.

611
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:08,411
Marty: Her name was Archer,
Lois Archer.

612
00:31:08,495 --> 00:31:09,869
She was 28.

613
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:11,453
She told me she'd been
with the police department

614
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:12,826
for five years--

615
00:31:12,868 --> 00:31:15,244
three as a secretary,
two as a street cop.

616
00:31:15,327 --> 00:31:16,452
That paid more.

617
00:31:16,535 --> 00:31:18,160
She thought
it would be exciting,

618
00:31:18,202 --> 00:31:19,909
but she wasn't
the cop type.

619
00:31:19,992 --> 00:31:22,034
She was staying with it
because jobs

620
00:31:22,076 --> 00:31:24,201
and good jobs
were hard to get out here.

621
00:31:24,243 --> 00:31:25,493
People came for the climate

622
00:31:25,576 --> 00:31:28,617
and were willing to work
for next to nothing to remain.

623
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,659
She had a brother
overseas in the army.

624
00:31:30,741 --> 00:31:32,908
He and she owned
a house, jointly.

625
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,616
That's all I was able
to find out about her

626
00:31:35,658 --> 00:31:38,449
and all I needed to know.

627
00:31:38,491 --> 00:31:40,406
Woman: ♪ I ♪

628
00:31:41,365 --> 00:31:43,657

634
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:15,734
You have very pretty
skin, Lois--

635
00:32:16,652 --> 00:32:18,318
A lovely blush.

636
00:32:20,526 --> 00:32:22,525
Not as extensive as
my wife's, of course,

637
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:24,317
but you don't have
her area.

638
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,692
[laughs]

639
00:32:26,775 --> 00:32:30,233
You are so crazy, honey.

640
00:32:30,274 --> 00:32:33,066
You and your
400-pound wife.

641
00:32:33,107 --> 00:32:35,608
She probably weighs
more than that now.

642
00:32:35,691 --> 00:32:38,607
She gets bigger
all the time.

643
00:32:38,649 --> 00:32:40,315
Elephantiasis.

644
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:41,607
It's not fat.

645
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,606
It's growth.

646
00:32:43,648 --> 00:32:46,980
Her head probably weighs
more than all of you.

647
00:32:47,022 --> 00:32:49,314
[laughs]

648
00:32:49,356 --> 00:32:51,563
Sure, I’ll bet.

649
00:32:51,647 --> 00:32:56,104
I can just see you
marrying a wife like that.

650
00:32:56,188 --> 00:32:58,978
Who else would have
married her?

651
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,520
Isn't she entitled
to marriage,

652
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,603
to all the things that
could have been given to her?

653
00:33:04,686 --> 00:33:05,727
I suppose it would've
been better

654
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:10,228
to put her to sleep
at birth like our first kid.

655
00:33:10,269 --> 00:33:11,352
Yeah, sure.

656
00:33:11,435 --> 00:33:13,268
Had to be done.

657
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,185
What kinder thing can you do
to a helpless mongoloid?

658
00:33:15,268 --> 00:33:17,726
[chuckles]

659
00:33:17,808 --> 00:33:20,643
And the one you have--

660
00:33:20,725 --> 00:33:21,725
I suppose
he doesn't have

661
00:33:21,808 --> 00:33:24,807
all of his parts, right?

662
00:33:24,891 --> 00:33:26,766
He's my kid, isn't he?

663
00:33:26,849 --> 00:33:29,683
He's bound to have
something missing.

664
00:33:29,766 --> 00:33:32,015
Marty, Marty, Marty.

665
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:36,390
Do you know what
I’m going to do to you?

666
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:39,598
No, that's not
the point, really.

667
00:33:40,681 --> 00:33:43,764
It's not what
you're going to do to me.

668
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:45,846
It's what I’m going
to do to you.

669
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,639
Marty: Except for the vague
sense of uneasiness

670
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:49,388
of something left undone,

671
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,804
I felt quite happy.

672
00:33:50,888 --> 00:33:52,096
I had Carol.

673
00:33:52,138 --> 00:33:53,512
We were brought
together again.

674
00:33:53,596 --> 00:33:54,762
I had Lois.

675
00:33:54,803 --> 00:33:56,720
At least, I would have her
for a while.

676
00:33:56,803 --> 00:33:59,054
Oh, I love that.

677
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,094
[laughs]

678
00:34:00,178 --> 00:34:01,220
That's the best.

679
00:34:01,303 --> 00:34:02,511
I know. Listen,
the house,

680
00:34:02,595 --> 00:34:04,178
it's on the outskirts
of town.

681
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,303
It's not as pricey
as it would be in town,

682
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:08,885
but some people may go
for that ocean view.

683
00:34:08,927 --> 00:34:12,093
Hmm. Sounds like
a very nice place.

684
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:14,676
I tell you, doll,
this brother angle

685
00:34:14,717 --> 00:34:16,926
presents a bit
of a problem.

686
00:34:17,009 --> 00:34:18,551
I don't know,
I get the impression

687
00:34:18,593 --> 00:34:21,467
he's a pretty tough
customer.

688
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,508
She gets nervous

689
00:34:23,592 --> 00:34:26,758
every time she mentions
his name.

690
00:34:27,674 --> 00:34:29,299
I got it all
worked out, though.

691
00:34:29,382 --> 00:34:31,674
Marty: The place is worth
about thirty grand.

692
00:34:31,757 --> 00:34:33,591
She cables him,
says she's got an offer.

693
00:34:33,674 --> 00:34:34,673
He signs the deed.

694
00:34:34,714 --> 00:34:35,756
I stop his clock,

695
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,089
force Lois to sell, and
we're thirty grand richer.

696
00:34:38,173 --> 00:34:39,673
The whole thing
will take about a month.

697
00:34:39,714 --> 00:34:42,589
Marty, you like
this one, don't you?

698
00:34:42,672 --> 00:34:43,713
You like her, huh?

699
00:34:43,755 --> 00:34:45,380
I like everyone,

700
00:34:45,464 --> 00:34:47,922
except, of course,
your ex-husband

701
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:50,296
william Wharton II,

702
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:53,004
who I owe a visit.

703
00:34:53,087 --> 00:34:55,420
Who I owe some pain.

704
00:34:55,503 --> 00:34:58,212
Aw, jeez, it's almost noon.

705
00:34:58,295 --> 00:35:02,252
I've got to get over to
Claire’s and put in my time.

706
00:35:02,294 --> 00:35:03,960
You know,
am I off my rocker,

707
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:04,960
or have you put on
a couple of pounds?

708
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:06,002
Ohh.

709
00:35:06,044 --> 00:35:07,044
Marty, you nut.

710
00:35:07,127 --> 00:35:08,336
No, it looks good on you.

711
00:35:08,419 --> 00:35:09,501
A little too much
of mom's feed bag.

712
00:35:09,585 --> 00:35:12,959
That's a very nice thing
to say to a girl.

713
00:35:13,001 --> 00:35:15,376
Say that to your cop,
and she'll pinch you.

714
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,708
Oh, the extra ounces
look good on you, kid.

715
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,542
See you.

716
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:22,292
Stay out
of trouble.

717
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:23,999
Marty: Just for a laugh,

718
00:35:24,082 --> 00:35:25,874
and since I had
no office to go to,

719
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,041
no clock to punch,

720
00:35:27,082 --> 00:35:30,498
I figured I’d watch sis ply
her chosen trade.

721
00:35:30,582 --> 00:35:36,748
As it turned out, it was
a damn good thing I did.

722
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,580
The fat pig in white

723
00:35:45,663 --> 00:35:47,996
had private dick
written all over him.

724
00:35:48,038 --> 00:35:49,871
Somebody wanted
to do my sister harm,

725
00:35:49,913 --> 00:35:55,078
and I had a pretty good idea
who it was.

726
00:36:50,613 --> 00:36:52,778
[person typing]

727
00:36:53,736 --> 00:36:55,903
[wheezing]

728
00:37:04,485 --> 00:37:06,652
[person typing]

729
00:37:30,689 --> 00:37:32,856
[coughs]

730
00:37:33,856 --> 00:37:36,063
[wheezes]

731
00:37:43,854 --> 00:37:45,521
Mr. Krutz.

732
00:37:45,605 --> 00:37:47,229
How do you do?

733
00:37:47,271 --> 00:37:49,103
My name is
Marty Grosvenor.

734
00:37:49,145 --> 00:37:50,728
Do I know you?

735
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,853
Our manager's secretary
didn't call

736
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:54,520
and tell you I was going
to pay you a call?

737
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:57,477
No, nobody called.

738
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:59,144
I'm Mr. Wharton II's
west coast representative.

739
00:37:59,186 --> 00:38:01,352
He told me to come down
and check with you.

740
00:38:01,436 --> 00:38:03,185
Oh, well, that's just swell.

741
00:38:03,226 --> 00:38:05,393
Uh, please, sit down.

742
00:38:05,476 --> 00:38:07,976
I was just on the case
just this morning

743
00:38:08,018 --> 00:38:09,726
trailing Mrs. Wharton.

744
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:11,100
[coughs]

745
00:38:11,184 --> 00:38:12,225
Tell me--
aren't you fellas

746
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:13,975
just rushing things
just a little bit here?

747
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:14,975
How's that?

748
00:38:15,058 --> 00:38:17,391
Well, I’ve only been
on the case four days,

749
00:38:17,474 --> 00:38:18,849
and I’ve already
sent in two reports.

750
00:38:18,932 --> 00:38:20,057
Four days?

751
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:22,974
Wharton, he likes to put
the squeeze on, doesn't he?

752
00:38:23,057 --> 00:38:23,973
And don't I know it.

753
00:38:24,056 --> 00:38:25,432
Ha!

754
00:38:25,473 --> 00:38:27,723
Well, I don't mean
to criticize.

755
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,432
The wages are fine,
but, you know--

756
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,055
No. Criticize
all you want.

757
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:33,514
You got every right to,
Mr. Krutz.

758
00:38:33,598 --> 00:38:35,639
I don't mean that man
ill will,

759
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,513
but, personally,
that man is a bastard.

760
00:38:38,555 --> 00:38:40,221
I mean, this case
is fact to that point.

761
00:38:40,305 --> 00:38:42,513
You know, you've got
something there,

762
00:38:42,555 --> 00:38:45,095
mr., uh, Grosvenor.

763
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:48,345
I know all about this case,

764
00:38:48,387 --> 00:38:51,137
even if not much of it
got into the papers.

765
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,595
You know what I mean?

766
00:38:52,677 --> 00:38:56,844
That guy Wharton
was as lowdown as they get.

767
00:38:56,927 --> 00:39:00,759
I mean, he was a washed-up,
worn-out punk,

768
00:39:00,801 --> 00:39:03,135
pimping for a living.

769
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:04,635
And so, somehow,

770
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:08,842
this--this swell
little dame

771
00:39:08,925 --> 00:39:10,009
carol Lakewood,

772
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,009
she decides to marry him.

773
00:39:12,092 --> 00:39:14,674
Never will figure
that one out.

774
00:39:14,757 --> 00:39:17,592
And she starts to get him
back on his feet.

775
00:39:17,674 --> 00:39:20,090
Well, there's nothing
he's any good at,

776
00:39:20,174 --> 00:39:22,549
so she supports
both of them.

777
00:39:22,591 --> 00:39:25,549
What time she ain't knocking
herself out on a job,

778
00:39:25,591 --> 00:39:28,298
she's working
to build him up--

779
00:39:28,381 --> 00:39:31,672
Nursing him, waiting on him
hand and foot,

780
00:39:31,755 --> 00:39:35,796
I mean, actually making
something out of nothing.

781
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:36,838
You know what
I’m talking about?

782
00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:38,963
And she does so good at it

783
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:42,962
that his big bucks
hoity-toity family back east,

784
00:39:43,004 --> 00:39:45,837
they decide
to take him back.

785
00:39:45,879 --> 00:39:47,752
So how does he thank her?

786
00:39:47,836 --> 00:39:49,420
He turns around

787
00:39:49,503 --> 00:39:55,210
and gives her a great big
dose of syphilis,

788
00:39:55,294 --> 00:39:59,751
and then, divorces her
for having it.

789
00:39:59,835 --> 00:40:05,501
Well, she was too young.
She couldn't put up a fight.

790
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:09,125
[passes gas]

791
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:12,958
Well, I see you know
all the facts,

792
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,958
don't you, Mr. Krutz?

793
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,332
You are well-grounded
in this case.

794
00:40:16,374 --> 00:40:18,748
Well, yeah, sure.

795
00:40:18,832 --> 00:40:20,457
It's my business.

796
00:40:20,499 --> 00:40:21,457
Know what I mean?

797
00:40:21,499 --> 00:40:22,456
[laughs]

798
00:40:22,498 --> 00:40:25,582
Well, what about your boss,

799
00:40:25,664 --> 00:40:27,331
mr. Grosvenor?

800
00:40:27,373 --> 00:40:30,247
Naturally, I’m glad to have
the job--tickled pink--

801
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:33,038
But why does he
want it done?

802
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:37,037
All this trouble just
to save himself a few bucks?

803
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:38,538
How can he do it?

804
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,413
I wonder.

805
00:40:41,454 --> 00:40:42,787
How can you do it?

806
00:40:43,703 --> 00:40:44,661
Say what?

807
00:40:44,744 --> 00:40:46,828
Tailing an innocent girl
for a filthy slug

808
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:47,911
just to make a buck.

809
00:40:47,995 --> 00:40:51,827
Aw, what the hell.
It's my job.

810
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:54,202
I mean, you know,
if I didn't do it,

811
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:56,327
somebody else would, huh?

812
00:40:56,369 --> 00:40:58,618
Am I right, mister, uh--
what'd you say your name was?

813
00:40:58,701 --> 00:41:01,076
Would somebody else
do it?

814
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,659
I mean, how the hell
can you be so sure?

815
00:41:03,701 --> 00:41:05,242
Have you ever considered
the potential

816
00:41:05,284 --> 00:41:06,741
in a crusade
for not doing something

817
00:41:06,825 --> 00:41:08,534
that someone else would do
just because you wouldn't?

818
00:41:08,576 --> 00:41:10,617
You simmer down here,
mister.

819
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,866
I'm afraid I don't like
your tone.

820
00:41:12,907 --> 00:41:14,449
I'm afraid that
you have sinned!

821
00:41:14,533 --> 00:41:17,533
You've violated section "a"
of commandment one-minus.

822
00:41:17,616 --> 00:41:19,240
Yea!

823
00:41:19,282 --> 00:41:20,490
Verily!

824
00:41:20,574 --> 00:41:22,490
Say, you can't blame me
for all this!

825
00:41:22,532 --> 00:41:25,197
Yea, verily,
so sayeth the lord,

826
00:41:25,281 --> 00:41:27,197
"better the blind man
who pisses through a window,

827
00:41:27,281 --> 00:41:30,072
than the knowing servant
who opens it for him."

828
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:32,696
Put it there, Krutz.

829
00:41:45,902 --> 00:41:47,444
Oh, dear.

830
00:41:50,777 --> 00:41:52,111
Oh, dear.

831
00:41:54,193 --> 00:41:55,818
Oh, dear, dear!

832
00:41:58,651 --> 00:41:59,900
[panting]

833
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:01,276
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

834
00:42:01,317 --> 00:42:02,484
Oh, dear.

835
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:05,692
Aah!

836
00:42:05,733 --> 00:42:07,358
Yes!

837
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,233
Yes!

838
00:42:09,316 --> 00:42:11,108
Aah!

839
00:42:11,191 --> 00:42:13,566
Aah!

840
00:42:13,607 --> 00:42:17,357
Aah!

841
00:42:17,399 --> 00:42:20,274
Aah!

842
00:42:20,356 --> 00:42:22,647
Aah!

843
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:24,897
Aah!

844
00:42:24,939 --> 00:42:27,106
[groans]

845
00:42:28,105 --> 00:42:29,980
Uhh...

846
00:42:35,645 --> 00:42:37,812
[groans]

847
00:42:40,187 --> 00:42:41,353
[gurgles]

848
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:51,519
I'm very upset with you,
Marty.

849
00:42:52,726 --> 00:42:53,768
Why's that, mom?

850
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:55,434
You know what you've done.

851
00:42:55,518 --> 00:42:58,434
You know all the wrong
things you do

852
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:01,309
that you just can't seem
to stop doing.

853
00:43:01,351 --> 00:43:02,475
Out with it, mom.
What's on your mind?

854
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:03,641
Why don't you
spit it out?

855
00:43:03,683 --> 00:43:04,975
I'm shocked.

856
00:43:05,058 --> 00:43:07,850
You'll get over it,
Ma, I promise.

857
00:43:11,182 --> 00:43:13,015
You quit your job
at the sentinel--

858
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:15,224
Just up and quit.

859
00:43:17,848 --> 00:43:20,889
I didn't want
to upset you, Ma.

860
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,223
It just happened.

861
00:43:22,265 --> 00:43:25,430
Mother: You just don't want
to amount to anything, do you?

862
00:43:25,514 --> 00:43:28,180
Neither one of you do.

863
00:43:28,264 --> 00:43:29,597
Do everything
you can not to.

864
00:43:31,096 --> 00:43:32,263
Well, all I can say is--

865
00:43:32,346 --> 00:43:33,846
Before you go
any further...

866
00:43:33,929 --> 00:43:35,096
OK, before you say
another word...

867
00:43:36,054 --> 00:43:37,845
I would like you
to establish

868
00:43:37,928 --> 00:43:39,970
your qualifications
for saying it.

869
00:43:40,053 --> 00:43:42,345
How do you mean?

870
00:43:42,428 --> 00:43:44,511
Well, I can't make it
any plainer, Ma.

871
00:43:44,553 --> 00:43:47,553
I don't want to be more
pointed about this, but...

872
00:43:47,635 --> 00:43:48,885
Let's just face facts here.

873
00:43:48,969 --> 00:43:50,511
Why should Carol and I
concern ourselves

874
00:43:50,553 --> 00:43:51,843
even in the slightest

875
00:43:51,884 --> 00:43:54,468
with what you think
about anything we do?

876
00:43:58,342 --> 00:44:00,592
Why should we
listen to you?

877
00:44:05,383 --> 00:44:06,966
Why should anyone?

878
00:44:19,672 --> 00:44:22,256
I did the very best I could
raising you kids.

879
00:44:24,089 --> 00:44:25,047
I couldn't help it if--

880
00:44:25,131 --> 00:44:26,171
We have a long list
of all the things

881
00:44:26,213 --> 00:44:27,712
you couldn't help, mother.

882
00:44:27,754 --> 00:44:29,171
Carol and I,
we've never blamed you,

883
00:44:29,213 --> 00:44:31,088
and we're never going to.

884
00:44:31,171 --> 00:44:35,003
Now, we can just sit here,
and we can enjoy our meal

885
00:44:35,087 --> 00:44:37,587
and have a pleasant evening
here at the old homestead,

886
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:40,586
only you've got
to play fair with us.

887
00:44:40,627 --> 00:44:41,752
We don't criticize you,

888
00:44:41,794 --> 00:44:43,211
so why don't you just keep
your mouth shut

889
00:44:43,294 --> 00:44:46,544
and forget all about
this unpleasant chitchat?

890
00:44:46,626 --> 00:44:49,127
[coughs]

891
00:44:49,168 --> 00:44:50,335
[sets down
silverware]

892
00:44:50,418 --> 00:44:53,085
I don't feel like
eating.

893
00:45:01,208 --> 00:45:03,250
[clears throat]

894
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:12,249
I think I’ll have
to lie down.

895
00:45:15,123 --> 00:45:16,289
Marty: Mom?

896
00:45:18,331 --> 00:45:20,164
[mother
stumbles]

897
00:45:22,913 --> 00:45:26,830
Are you OK?
Carol, give me a hand.

898
00:45:26,913 --> 00:45:29,162
Carol, can you
give me a hand?

899
00:45:29,204 --> 00:45:30,371
Carol?

900
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:32,829
Carol!

901
00:45:34,954 --> 00:45:36,619
Sure.

902
00:45:44,035 --> 00:45:45,952
Mother:
I can't get my breath.

903
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:47,410
[coughs]

904
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,034
Marty: Take it easy.
You just need to rest.

905
00:45:49,118 --> 00:45:50,118
How's that stuff
coming, Carol?

906
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:51,535
It's coming right up.

907
00:45:51,617 --> 00:45:53,493
This is just the ticket
for what ails you, mom.

908
00:45:53,576 --> 00:45:56,242
[breathing heavily]

909
00:45:56,283 --> 00:45:58,325
There you go, mom.
You like this stuff, right?

910
00:45:58,408 --> 00:45:59,325
Sure, I do.

911
00:45:59,408 --> 00:46:00,783
Feeling better, mom?

912
00:46:00,825 --> 00:46:02,658
Yeah, a little bit.

913
00:46:04,241 --> 00:46:06,990
Just don't do
anything else.

914
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:09,366
Ahem.

915
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:24,113
[closes door]

916
00:46:24,196 --> 00:46:25,612
Marty: Blindness, honey.

917
00:46:25,654 --> 00:46:27,821
It's the first step
towards sudden brain death.

918
00:46:28,946 --> 00:46:31,778
It's a death
for our time--

919
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:34,653
A death for people
too stupid to appreciate

920
00:46:34,736 --> 00:46:35,986
something
more complicated,

921
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:37,694
worthy of
contemporary attitudes

922
00:46:37,735 --> 00:46:39,486
like "let's drop the bomb
on Moscow."

923
00:46:39,528 --> 00:46:43,027
And "the poor are better off
and happier being poor."

924
00:46:43,069 --> 00:46:44,859
I swear to god,
it's my profoundest wish.

925
00:46:44,943 --> 00:46:46,651
I'd like to kill someone
really worthwhile.

926
00:46:46,734 --> 00:46:48,734
Yeah.

927
00:46:48,818 --> 00:46:50,776
I feel sorry
for old Mr. Krutz.

928
00:46:50,859 --> 00:46:53,526
I wish I could've
had him in bed with me.

929
00:46:53,567 --> 00:46:56,150
They're always so happy
that way.

930
00:46:56,234 --> 00:46:57,359
Under the circumstances,

931
00:46:57,442 --> 00:46:59,525
I think a little extra
alimony's out of the question.

932
00:46:59,607 --> 00:47:01,774
[laughs]

933
00:47:04,982 --> 00:47:06,898
You know...

934
00:47:06,981 --> 00:47:09,398
I hate you going over
to Claire’s.

935
00:47:09,482 --> 00:47:10,648
Right now, it's--

936
00:47:10,731 --> 00:47:11,689
You shouldn't have to.

937
00:47:11,731 --> 00:47:13,647
Don't worry about me,
sweetie.

938
00:47:13,688 --> 00:47:15,939
I feel just fine.

939
00:47:16,022 --> 00:47:18,272
Besides, I need
my own racket.

940
00:47:18,356 --> 00:47:20,271
Got to work to keep up
my self-respect.

941
00:47:21,396 --> 00:47:24,522
Don't wear yourself out.
It's not necessary.

942
00:47:24,563 --> 00:47:26,562
This other matter,
I’m getting close.

943
00:47:26,603 --> 00:47:27,562
This house deal,

944
00:47:27,645 --> 00:47:30,145
I think I’m going
to swing that real soon.

945
00:47:30,229 --> 00:47:31,479
Have you decided what
you're going to do with Lois

946
00:47:31,562 --> 00:47:32,479
at the windups?

947
00:47:32,562 --> 00:47:33,811
Call me psychic,

948
00:47:33,894 --> 00:47:37,019
but I don't think I’m going
to have to decide.

949
00:47:37,103 --> 00:47:38,019
The fitting thing
will be done,

950
00:47:38,103 --> 00:47:41,018
but I’ll have
nothing to do with it.

951
00:47:41,102 --> 00:47:43,435
It's going to be
a matter of grace.

952
00:47:43,477 --> 00:47:46,643
Whatever you say,
sweetie.

953
00:47:46,684 --> 00:47:47,683
It's all right by me.

954
00:47:47,725 --> 00:47:49,892
[car approaches]

955
00:47:49,975 --> 00:47:51,184
That's her.

956
00:47:51,226 --> 00:47:52,892
See you.

957
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:16,805
[front door opens,
footsteps]

958
00:48:20,263 --> 00:48:21,930
Marty: Hey.

959
00:48:24,137 --> 00:48:26,513
What's your sister
doing tonight?

960
00:48:26,554 --> 00:48:28,262
She's got a date.

961
00:48:28,346 --> 00:48:29,719
Move over.

962
00:48:40,427 --> 00:48:42,344
[starts engine]

963
00:48:45,592 --> 00:48:46,592
Marty: On the drive
to the beach,

964
00:48:46,634 --> 00:48:49,009
lois was pouting
and peevish.

965
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,925
I could hear the wheels
spinning with irritation

966
00:48:50,966 --> 00:48:52,883
in that cop's mind of hers.

967
00:48:52,966 --> 00:48:56,092
I could have let it go,
but what the hell.

968
00:48:58,466 --> 00:49:00,049
What's bugging you, Lois?

969
00:49:00,091 --> 00:49:01,424
Nothing.

970
00:49:01,508 --> 00:49:04,465
Pig's eye.
What's eating you?

971
00:49:04,548 --> 00:49:06,381
It's just the way
that Carol of yours lives--

972
00:49:06,423 --> 00:49:07,881
That house,

973
00:49:07,923 --> 00:49:10,423
the slinky dresses
she sashays around town in.

974
00:49:10,465 --> 00:49:11,588
You'd think
she was royalty.

975
00:49:11,671 --> 00:49:14,880
Well, that's how she is.

976
00:49:14,922 --> 00:49:17,255
She'd die if it had
to be any other way.

977
00:49:17,297 --> 00:49:19,296
Stop talking nonsense
and just tell me this, Marty.

978
00:49:19,379 --> 00:49:21,254
Just tell me why I should be
given this pressure from you

979
00:49:21,296 --> 00:49:23,213
all the time
about selling my house

980
00:49:23,296 --> 00:49:25,295
when you could just as well
ask that fine sister of yours

981
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:26,628
to help us go away.

982
00:49:26,669 --> 00:49:28,545
Wait. Now, you...

983
00:49:28,628 --> 00:49:30,462
You want me
to ask for money

984
00:49:30,504 --> 00:49:32,960
for us to live on

985
00:49:33,044 --> 00:49:34,794
from my sister?

986
00:49:35,794 --> 00:49:37,627
Really? That's...

987
00:49:40,251 --> 00:49:41,876
[gasps]

988
00:49:41,918 --> 00:49:43,793
That's my proposal,
Lois. I'm sorry.

989
00:49:43,876 --> 00:49:45,376
Let's hear
your response.

990
00:49:45,418 --> 00:49:47,209
You bastard.

991
00:49:50,542 --> 00:49:52,000
I'm sorry.

992
00:49:52,084 --> 00:49:53,291
How about that?

993
00:49:53,333 --> 00:49:54,291
How about that, Lois?

994
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:56,124
No, Marty, please.

995
00:49:56,166 --> 00:49:57,665
Is that better?
Stop.

996
00:49:57,707 --> 00:49:59,166
It'll show,
and I have to work.

997
00:49:59,249 --> 00:50:01,664
Show? My sloe-eyed slut!

998
00:50:01,706 --> 00:50:03,123
My copulating cop!

999
00:50:03,165 --> 00:50:05,332
How about that, Lois?
Is that better?

1000
00:50:05,373 --> 00:50:07,372
How about that, huh?
How about that, Lois?

1001
00:50:07,414 --> 00:50:10,206
Is that all right?
Is that better?

1002
00:50:10,289 --> 00:50:11,872
How about that, Lois?
How about that?

1003
00:50:11,955 --> 00:50:13,538
[pants]

1004
00:50:13,621 --> 00:50:15,996
Harder, Marty.

1005
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,205
Harder.

1006
00:50:17,246 --> 00:50:18,913
Lois.

1007
00:50:18,996 --> 00:50:20,828
I'm trying to help you
see things clearly here.

1008
00:50:20,912 --> 00:50:21,995
No, no, no,
don't talk, darling.

1009
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,537
No. You know
what I’m thinking?

1010
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,537
I think I’m going
to walk up the highway

1011
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:26,370
and get myself a cab
and get out of here.

1012
00:50:26,454 --> 00:50:27,702
Don't you dare.

1013
00:50:27,786 --> 00:50:29,786
You want me to do this?

1014
00:50:29,869 --> 00:50:32,536
You want it?

1015
00:50:32,619 --> 00:50:35,160
Like that?
Like that?

1016
00:50:35,243 --> 00:50:36,826
I'm thinking maybe I ought
to leave you out here--

1017
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:39,410
Let the kids who play jacks
see you in the morning.

1018
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:41,617
What do you think of that?

1019
00:50:42,992 --> 00:50:45,242
Do whatever you want.

1020
00:50:45,326 --> 00:50:46,534
Are you sure?

1021
00:50:46,575 --> 00:50:48,741
What else is there?

1022
00:50:51,241 --> 00:50:54,033
Truer words were
never spoken, babe.

1023
00:50:54,075 --> 00:50:55,033
Come on.

1024
00:50:55,074 --> 00:50:56,407
[moaning]

1025
00:51:08,406 --> 00:51:09,322
Marty: The next morning,

1026
00:51:09,405 --> 00:51:10,530
she phoned in
to the department

1027
00:51:10,613 --> 00:51:12,738
and reported herself sick
and was given the day off,

1028
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:15,945
so I kept on
staying.

1029
00:51:16,029 --> 00:51:17,362
[laughs]

1030
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,736
It was a pretty wild day.

1031
00:51:26,819 --> 00:51:28,070
A sweetly wild day--

1032
00:51:28,111 --> 00:51:31,943
A perfect commingling
of sweetness and wildness.

1033
00:51:39,318 --> 00:51:41,193
We stripped every damn
picture in the house

1034
00:51:41,276 --> 00:51:42,318
from the walls.

1035
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:43,526
[laughs]

1036
00:51:43,609 --> 00:51:45,442
It was the most hideous kind
of crap, those pictures--

1037
00:51:45,484 --> 00:51:47,275
Cute stuff,
dime store junk.

1038
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:49,442
[laughs]

1039
00:51:52,857 --> 00:51:55,024
[laughs]

1040
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:06,897
[laughs]

1041
00:52:15,146 --> 00:52:16,979
Marty: We dug up a couple
of her brother's rifles

1042
00:52:17,063 --> 00:52:19,479
and lugged the lot
down to the beach.

1043
00:52:19,561 --> 00:52:21,103
[laughs]

1044
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,478
[gunshot]

1045
00:52:32,726 --> 00:52:33,893
[gunshot]

1046
00:52:36,601 --> 00:52:38,684
[laughs]

1047
00:52:38,768 --> 00:52:40,933
[gunshot]

1048
00:52:41,017 --> 00:52:42,309
Marty: Then we ate
and drank some more

1049
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:44,392
and had another bath.

1050
00:52:52,183 --> 00:52:54,265
[laughs]

1051
00:52:59,765 --> 00:53:01,972
Marty: She made herself
into a pretty peacock.

1052
00:53:07,763 --> 00:53:08,929
[laughs]

1053
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:36,509
Marty: We said nothing
about money all day.

1054
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:39,800
We were afraid of spoiling
that sweet wildness,

1055
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:44,050
so we still did not
speak of money.

1056
00:53:50,007 --> 00:53:51,174
Marty...

1057
00:53:52,049 --> 00:53:53,548
I don't want you
slaving away

1058
00:53:53,631 --> 00:53:55,798
over any old newspaper.

1059
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:03,588
I want us to be all alone--

1060
00:54:03,671 --> 00:54:04,880
Away...

1061
00:54:06,921 --> 00:54:09,505
Off somewhere by ourselves.

1062
00:54:09,588 --> 00:54:12,837
Well, let's see, then.

1063
00:54:12,879 --> 00:54:14,795
We could...

1064
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,420
Run a dairy.

1065
00:54:18,503 --> 00:54:19,919
None of this mechanized
stuff they got these days--

1066
00:54:20,003 --> 00:54:21,753
All natural, pure milk.

1067
00:54:21,794 --> 00:54:23,711
I'm going to pinch you
in a minute, smarty.

1068
00:54:23,752 --> 00:54:26,502
Well, I could finish
writing my book.

1069
00:54:27,877 --> 00:54:29,543
We could get
pretty rich off that.

1070
00:54:29,626 --> 00:54:30,543
You're writing
a book, honey?

1071
00:54:30,626 --> 00:54:32,084
Mmm.

1072
00:54:32,126 --> 00:54:33,084
Tell me about it.

1073
00:54:33,126 --> 00:54:34,334
No, I couldn't.

1074
00:54:35,584 --> 00:54:36,751
No, really,
it's nothing.

1075
00:54:36,834 --> 00:54:38,167
It's...

1076
00:54:39,417 --> 00:54:40,958
Just my solution
to the deficit crisis--

1077
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,125
You know, a treatise on
taxation sort of thing.

1078
00:54:44,208 --> 00:54:47,041
All right, I call it my
cornucopia of constipation

1079
00:54:47,082 --> 00:54:49,540
or the Martin Lakewood
bowel movement single tax.

1080
00:54:49,582 --> 00:54:51,581
[laughs]
oh.

1081
00:54:51,664 --> 00:54:53,040
Crazy.

1082
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,290
Yeah, doll, it's
simple but beautiful.

1083
00:54:54,373 --> 00:54:58,040
I do away with all taxes on
food and other necessities,

1084
00:54:58,081 --> 00:54:59,705
and the only levy

1085
00:54:59,788 --> 00:55:01,538
would be
on bowel movements.

1086
00:55:01,621 --> 00:55:02,872
What do you think?

1087
00:55:02,955 --> 00:55:05,164
It's really a sensible plan.

1088
00:55:05,247 --> 00:55:06,204
A workable concept,

1089
00:55:06,288 --> 00:55:07,996
as the boys in Washington
like to call it.

1090
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:10,496
You know, it's possibly
the most equitable

1091
00:55:10,579 --> 00:55:13,245
and just plan
ever invented.

1092
00:55:14,162 --> 00:55:15,495
Listen.

1093
00:55:15,536 --> 00:55:17,454
The less money a man
has, the less he eats.

1094
00:55:17,536 --> 00:55:18,578
The less he eats,
the less he shits.

1095
00:55:18,661 --> 00:55:19,827
The less he shits,
well...

1096
00:55:19,869 --> 00:55:20,827
The less are his taxes.

1097
00:55:20,869 --> 00:55:21,910
Mm-hmm.

1098
00:55:21,994 --> 00:55:23,369
And what if he doesn't have
any money at all?

1099
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:25,077
Well, what does he
do now?

1100
00:55:25,161 --> 00:55:26,410
Oh, very funny,
Marty. Ha ha.

1101
00:55:26,452 --> 00:55:28,493
No. Who's kidding?

1102
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:29,868
If it's right to let
a man starve to death,

1103
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:30,868
it must be equally right

1104
00:55:30,909 --> 00:55:32,826
to let him die
of constipation.

1105
00:55:32,909 --> 00:55:33,992
It's not equally right.

1106
00:55:34,075 --> 00:55:35,533
It's more right,
god damn it.

1107
00:55:35,616 --> 00:55:36,533
[laughing]

1108
00:55:36,616 --> 00:55:38,658
This way, at least
he's got a choice--

1109
00:55:38,742 --> 00:55:40,991
A little control over
his own destiny.

1110
00:55:41,074 --> 00:55:42,699
Enough of this
unwarranted intrusion

1111
00:55:42,782 --> 00:55:44,366
by government
bureaucrats.

1112
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:46,450
[laughing]

1113
00:55:46,491 --> 00:55:48,823
What, you can
deny him food,

1114
00:55:48,865 --> 00:55:51,115
but you can't keep him
from holding his bowels?

1115
00:55:51,198 --> 00:55:52,323
Where is the fairness
in that?

1116
00:55:52,365 --> 00:55:55,530
People have got
to learn about...

1117
00:55:56,530 --> 00:55:57,947
Responsibility.
What's so funny?

1118
00:55:58,031 --> 00:55:59,489
People have got to learn
about responsibility.

1119
00:55:59,572 --> 00:56:00,739
I think the bowel
movement tax

1120
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:01,738
leads into
that direction.

1121
00:56:01,779 --> 00:56:02,946
What is
so goddamn funny?

1122
00:56:11,446 --> 00:56:12,362
Ahem.

1123
00:56:12,446 --> 00:56:13,487
It's just a joke.

1124
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:17,986
It's about the oldest joke
in the goddamn world.

1125
00:56:39,524 --> 00:56:40,691
[laughs]

1126
00:56:53,814 --> 00:56:56,481
Do you love me, Marty?

1127
00:56:59,855 --> 00:57:02,272
Do you love me
very much?

1128
00:57:02,355 --> 00:57:04,645
Marty: We'd been
on this line before--

1129
00:57:04,729 --> 00:57:07,021
I imagine
almost every man has--

1130
00:57:07,062 --> 00:57:10,271
And I gave her the reply
she wanted.

1131
00:57:10,354 --> 00:57:12,519
You know
something, Lois?

1132
00:57:14,311 --> 00:57:16,478
I'm afraid I do.

1133
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:27,642
Do you love me
more than anyone?

1134
00:57:28,851 --> 00:57:32,725
Do you love me more
than you love your sister?

1135
00:57:32,808 --> 00:57:34,183
Well...

1136
00:57:34,267 --> 00:57:35,183
What do you got
to bring her up for?

1137
00:57:35,267 --> 00:57:37,475
Do you, baby?

1138
00:57:38,557 --> 00:57:39,932
Just tell me.

1139
00:57:40,016 --> 00:57:40,932
What?

1140
00:57:41,016 --> 00:57:41,932
Just say it.

1141
00:57:42,016 --> 00:57:44,682
I told you.
They're different.

1142
00:57:45,931 --> 00:57:46,889
They're completely
different.

1143
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:49,098
They're two different things.

1144
00:57:50,432 --> 00:57:54,097
One's a glass of milk,
one's a highball.

1145
00:57:54,139 --> 00:57:55,097
Ohh.

1146
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:56,596
Both satisfying
in their own ways,

1147
00:57:56,638 --> 00:57:57,763
but they're
completely different.

1148
00:57:57,805 --> 00:58:00,221
They're just
two different drinks.

1149
00:58:00,304 --> 00:58:03,595
They're two different
kinds of love.

1150
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:07,761
They're not comparable,
these two, Lois.

1151
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:11,137
Why do you have
to go do that?

1152
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:12,137
Why'd you have
to do that?

1153
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:14,552
That--that's so stupid.

1154
00:58:14,593 --> 00:58:17,552
What, do you want
to get smacked?

1155
00:58:17,593 --> 00:58:20,177
You talk so mean to me
sometimes, Marty.

1156
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:21,427
I don't go off

1157
00:58:21,509 --> 00:58:24,176
about you and
your brother, do I,

1158
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:26,135
in his cute uniform

1159
00:58:26,218 --> 00:58:27,633
and all this
other bullshit,

1160
00:58:27,675 --> 00:58:29,300
but you love him,
don't you?

1161
00:58:29,384 --> 00:58:30,467
And I honor that,
you know.

1162
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:32,426
You probably love him
more than anyone else.

1163
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,425
I do not!
I only love you!

1164
00:58:35,466 --> 00:58:37,466
I love you more than
I love anyone else

1165
00:58:37,507 --> 00:58:38,466
in the whole world,

1166
00:58:38,507 --> 00:58:39,549
and I want to hear

1167
00:58:39,632 --> 00:58:42,173
the exact same thing
back from you!

1168
00:58:42,215 --> 00:58:43,424
You're going to have
to wait a long time

1169
00:58:43,506 --> 00:58:45,840
to hear something
like that, Lois.

1170
00:58:45,881 --> 00:58:47,090
[telephone rings]

1171
00:58:47,173 --> 00:58:48,839
Let it go.

1172
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,172
Marty: One ring,
and she stopped.

1173
00:58:50,214 --> 00:58:52,672
It was Carol's signal.

1174
00:58:52,755 --> 00:58:53,797
I waited
for the next ring.

1175
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,213
That's funny.

1176
00:58:55,255 --> 00:58:57,754
Lois waited for whatever
she was waiting for.

1177
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:00,422
It just stopped.

1178
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,462
[telephone rings]

1179
00:59:06,004 --> 00:59:07,379
Ow!

1180
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:10,086
What did you
pull my hair for?

1181
00:59:10,169 --> 00:59:11,086
Carol: Is that you,
Marty?

1182
00:59:11,169 --> 00:59:12,336
Marty: It was Carol.

1183
00:59:12,378 --> 00:59:13,794
She spoke rapidly,

1184
00:59:13,836 --> 00:59:15,627
her voice pitched
just above a whisper.

1185
00:59:15,669 --> 00:59:17,043
Marty: I'll get back
as soon as I can.

1186
00:59:17,127 --> 00:59:18,793
Lois understands.

1187
00:59:23,001 --> 00:59:24,625
I'm sorry
I pulled your hair.

1188
00:59:24,709 --> 00:59:25,625
Is that it?

1189
00:59:25,709 --> 00:59:28,875
My mom just had
a mild heart attack.

1190
00:59:28,917 --> 00:59:31,083
Look, she's had them before.
It's nothing serious,

1191
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:32,291
but Carol thinks
I ought to be there.

1192
00:59:32,375 --> 00:59:34,166
I think I ought
to be there!

1193
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:35,958
So, that's what
Carol thinks?

1194
00:59:36,041 --> 00:59:37,457
Yeah!

1195
00:59:37,498 --> 00:59:38,832
You can just call
yourself a cab,

1196
00:59:38,915 --> 00:59:41,332
because you are not
using my car

1197
00:59:41,416 --> 00:59:44,123
to go run off
to your little Carol!

1198
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:46,373
I see the way you two
sniff around each other.

1199
00:59:46,456 --> 00:59:48,248
You want to know
what I think is going on?

1200
00:59:48,331 --> 00:59:49,331
Huh, Marty?

1201
00:59:49,373 --> 00:59:50,622
Do you want to know
what I think is going on

1202
00:59:50,705 --> 00:59:52,372
between you and
your stupid little Carol?

1203
00:59:52,414 --> 00:59:53,955
Do you?
Do you want to know?

1204
00:59:54,038 --> 00:59:55,038
Do you want to know?

1205
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,205
Shut up.

1206
00:59:56,288 --> 00:59:57,662
Hi. Can you please
send a taxi

1207
00:59:57,704 --> 01:00:00,162
to 175433 Wildwood Road

1208
01:00:00,246 --> 01:00:02,413
as fast as you can?

1209
01:00:02,495 --> 01:00:03,578
What? Come on,
let's hear it!

1210
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:05,203
What's in that tiny mind
of yours, Lois?

1211
01:00:05,245 --> 01:00:07,370
Come on! Come on!

1212
01:00:07,412 --> 01:00:08,703
I think
you're fucking her!

1213
01:00:08,786 --> 01:00:11,412
I think you're fucking
that little tramp!

1214
01:00:11,453 --> 01:00:12,952
I think
you're fucking her

1215
01:00:12,994 --> 01:00:14,910
morning, noon,
and night!

1216
01:00:15,785 --> 01:00:16,785
Oh!

1217
01:00:16,827 --> 01:00:17,910
Oh, my god!

1218
01:00:17,994 --> 01:00:20,201
[crying]

1219
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:21,993
Oh, my god,
what am I saying?

1220
01:00:22,034 --> 01:00:24,118
I am so sorry.

1221
01:00:40,031 --> 01:00:41,323
I'm so sorry.

1222
01:00:41,407 --> 01:00:43,614
I'm...

1223
01:00:43,656 --> 01:00:45,323
Baby, I’m sorry.

1224
01:00:46,406 --> 01:00:48,447
You know, I’m sorry
I could do something

1225
01:00:48,488 --> 01:00:50,406
to make you say
such a thing to me.

1226
01:00:50,488 --> 01:00:52,155
Please forgive me.

1227
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:53,988
Please forgive me.

1228
01:00:54,071 --> 01:00:56,238
[breathes heavily]

1229
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:01,362
Y-you can
take my car, OK?

1230
01:01:01,404 --> 01:01:02,362
OK?

1231
01:01:02,445 --> 01:01:04,486
Thanks.

1232
01:01:04,528 --> 01:01:06,320
Would you do that, baby?

1233
01:01:06,404 --> 01:01:08,485
You come back,

1234
01:01:08,568 --> 01:01:10,902
because I got
such a need for you.

1235
01:01:10,944 --> 01:01:12,069
[crying]

1236
01:01:12,111 --> 01:01:13,277
Shh.

1237
01:01:17,609 --> 01:01:18,776
I'll be back soon.

1238
01:01:22,817 --> 01:01:24,817
Marty:
I took her car, naturally.

1239
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,733
She insisted on it.

1240
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,978
Carol?

1241
01:02:06,852 --> 01:02:08,811
Carol?

1242
01:02:21,226 --> 01:02:23,101
You got him, doll.

1243
01:02:23,142 --> 01:02:24,350
He's not gonna hurt you,

1244
01:02:24,433 --> 01:02:26,266
he's not gonna hurt
anyone ever again.

1245
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:28,392
I didn't get him, Marty.

1246
01:02:30,474 --> 01:02:32,556
Well, he's dead.

1247
01:02:34,682 --> 01:02:37,473
At least you could
have called me.

1248
01:02:37,515 --> 01:02:40,139
It kind of makes a fella
feel inadequate--

1249
01:02:40,181 --> 01:02:41,597
Taking care of business

1250
01:02:41,681 --> 01:02:42,973
without letting
a fella know.

1251
01:02:43,014 --> 01:02:44,888
I didn't do it, Marty.

1252
01:02:44,972 --> 01:02:47,680
It just... I don't know,
it just happened.

1253
01:02:47,721 --> 01:02:51,389
It just...
It just happened.

1254
01:02:51,471 --> 01:02:52,804
What? What happened?

1255
01:02:52,887 --> 01:02:55,096
Come on,
you can tell me.

1256
01:02:57,096 --> 01:03:00,761
Carol: I was coming out
of the gin joint downtown.

1257
01:03:04,261 --> 01:03:07,177
And he came up to me.

1258
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:11,927
He was in from out of town,
so I brought him here.

1259
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:14,550
It was so weird.

1260
01:03:14,634 --> 01:03:16,009
Marty: What was, baby?

1261
01:03:16,051 --> 01:03:18,051
What was weird?

1262
01:03:18,134 --> 01:03:20,342
COME ON,

1263
01:03:21,466 --> 01:03:23,925
yoU CAN TELL ME.
I STARTED TO GET

1264
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:26,590
A LITTLE STIMULATED.

1265
01:03:26,674 --> 01:03:29,966
[MAN MOANING]
[CAROL MOANING]

1266
01:03:33,257 --> 01:03:34,965
Yeah, well,
he's a big guy.

1267
01:03:35,048 --> 01:03:37,464
It happens.

1268
01:03:37,506 --> 01:03:39,340
And all of a sudden,

1269
01:03:39,423 --> 01:03:41,130
everything that ever
happened to us

1270
01:03:41,214 --> 01:03:43,838
with mom and pop and that
lady across the street

1271
01:03:43,922 --> 01:03:46,005
and her husband and that look
the guy had on his face

1272
01:03:46,047 --> 01:03:47,712
when dad shot him...

1273
01:03:48,587 --> 01:03:49,671
Woman: Aah!

1274
01:03:49,754 --> 01:03:52,380
It all just came back to me.

1275
01:03:55,878 --> 01:03:57,379
Woman: Aah!

1276
01:03:59,379 --> 01:04:00,836
[gunshot]

1277
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,086
[moaning]

1278
01:04:08,335 --> 01:04:11,085
And all of a sudden,
I looked down,

1279
01:04:11,126 --> 01:04:12,709
and the guy
is, like, shaking

1280
01:04:12,793 --> 01:04:13,960
as though
he's electrocuted,

1281
01:04:14,043 --> 01:04:16,125
and the next thing I know,
there's blood coming out

1282
01:04:16,167 --> 01:04:17,875
of his eyes and his ears
and his mouth.

1283
01:04:17,959 --> 01:04:20,125
[panting]

1284
01:04:28,499 --> 01:04:30,665
[crying hysterically]

1285
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:38,789
Marty, look at the guy.
He's a bloody mess.

1286
01:04:38,872 --> 01:04:40,872
Well, I got to
hand it to you, dear.

1287
01:04:40,914 --> 01:04:42,414
You're probably
the first hooker

1288
01:04:42,455 --> 01:04:43,704
in recorded history

1289
01:04:43,788 --> 01:04:46,330
to induce seizures
and cerebral hemorrhage.

1290
01:04:48,121 --> 01:04:50,162
Oh, Marty.

1291
01:04:50,245 --> 01:04:52,329
Oh, babe.

1292
01:04:52,412 --> 01:04:53,828
Who was he?

1293
01:04:54,995 --> 01:04:58,577
His name was
Barnett Gibons.

1294
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:00,994
He sold life insurance.

1295
01:05:05,202 --> 01:05:06,701
You're kidding, right?

1296
01:05:06,785 --> 01:05:08,035
No.

1297
01:05:08,077 --> 01:05:10,327
Marty, it's not funny.

1298
01:06:06,817 --> 01:06:09,984
Just another wreck
by the side of the road.

1299
01:06:11,401 --> 01:06:13,566
Just hang in there, kiddo.

1300
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:15,275
It's all gonna be fine.

1301
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:16,524
Is it, Marty?

1302
01:06:16,566 --> 01:06:18,524
Yeah. I said so, didn't I?

1303
01:06:18,566 --> 01:06:20,440
Of course it is.

1304
01:06:20,523 --> 01:06:22,399
I'm gonna be sick.

1305
01:06:22,482 --> 01:06:24,815
[retching]

1306
01:06:34,605 --> 01:06:37,521
Easy, babe.
You're so jumpy.

1307
01:06:37,605 --> 01:06:39,855
I never saw it
get to you like that.

1308
01:06:39,897 --> 01:06:42,687
They never went
that way before.

1309
01:06:42,771 --> 01:06:45,188
They all gotta go somehow,
don't they?

1310
01:06:45,271 --> 01:06:47,437
We all do.

1311
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,478
It was all written down
more than a million years ago

1312
01:06:50,561 --> 01:06:53,395
by a... very funny god.

1313
01:06:53,436 --> 01:06:56,061
You know, in the beginning,
there was nothing.

1314
01:06:56,102 --> 01:06:58,936
Then he spoke, and that's
when all the shit started.

1315
01:06:59,019 --> 01:07:01,144
We're just pawns, kid.

1316
01:07:01,227 --> 01:07:04,352
You know, players...
Playing a part.

1317
01:07:04,434 --> 01:07:06,476
God had to do something
to amuse himself,

1318
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:08,310
so he dreamt us up.

1319
01:07:10,142 --> 01:07:13,142
I hope he got a good laugh,
don't you, babe?

1320
01:07:13,184 --> 01:07:15,808
The things you say,
Marty.

1321
01:07:27,473 --> 01:07:28,890
You awake?

1322
01:07:32,764 --> 01:07:34,597
How's your sister?

1323
01:07:34,639 --> 01:07:35,764
Forget about her.

1324
01:07:35,847 --> 01:07:37,096
What time is it?

1325
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:40,096
Forget about all that.
I'm your alarm clock.

1326
01:07:40,138 --> 01:07:42,305
You wake up,
you cable your brother.

1327
01:07:42,347 --> 01:07:44,470
You tell him
you got a buyer.

1328
01:07:44,553 --> 01:07:45,553
You tell him he's
gotta fly down here

1329
01:07:45,637 --> 01:07:46,762
to sign the deed.

1330
01:07:46,845 --> 01:07:47,970
Next time I see you,

1331
01:07:48,012 --> 01:07:49,678
you better show me
a copy of that cable

1332
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,178
with the right date
on it.

1333
01:07:51,261 --> 01:07:53,094
Otherwise,
we're washed up.

1334
01:07:55,636 --> 01:07:58,135
Marty:
I got away fast, pleased.

1335
01:07:58,218 --> 01:08:00,344
She was certain to relent.

1336
01:08:00,385 --> 01:08:01,885
She had to.

1337
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,633
Marty?

1338
01:08:17,799 --> 01:08:19,132
Marty?

1339
01:08:23,506 --> 01:08:24,924
Marty?

1340
01:08:27,631 --> 01:08:29,589
[door opens]

1341
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:32,671
Hey. Is it bad?

1342
01:08:32,713 --> 01:08:34,880
It's really bad, Marty.

1343
01:08:34,963 --> 01:08:37,588
I can't get him
out of my head.

1344
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:40,254
Don't. Don't think.

1345
01:08:40,296 --> 01:08:42,962
It was the way
it was meant to be.

1346
01:08:43,046 --> 01:08:44,962
Don't remember.
That's the best way.

1347
01:08:45,046 --> 01:08:47,461
You'll see it that way.

1348
01:08:47,502 --> 01:08:49,753
But this thing,
it'll go away, right?

1349
01:08:49,794 --> 01:08:51,461
This thing in my head?

1350
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:53,418
They always do,
don't they?

1351
01:08:53,501 --> 01:08:55,960
But this one's
really bad, Marty.

1352
01:08:56,002 --> 01:08:59,044
This one,
it's really bad.

1353
01:09:00,251 --> 01:09:01,876
You know,
in the daytime,

1354
01:09:01,918 --> 01:09:05,500
those night things,
they just go away.

1355
01:09:05,542 --> 01:09:07,458
And in the nighttime,
the day things go.

1356
01:09:07,541 --> 01:09:08,958
Just remember that.

1357
01:09:09,042 --> 01:09:10,000
Yeah.

1358
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:12,375
Remember that, and it'll
all be all right.

1359
01:09:12,416 --> 01:09:15,082
Yeah. That's good, Marty.
Tell me a story.

1360
01:09:20,999 --> 01:09:23,706
Once upon a time,
there was a...

1361
01:09:23,789 --> 01:09:26,373
A little boy
and a little girl.

1362
01:09:26,456 --> 01:09:27,664
You all right?

1363
01:09:27,706 --> 01:09:29,830
The little girl
was her mother, and...

1364
01:09:29,872 --> 01:09:31,663
The little boy
was her father.

1365
01:09:31,747 --> 01:09:32,747
[door opens]

1366
01:09:32,830 --> 01:09:34,039
And the little girl
was...

1367
01:09:34,122 --> 01:09:36,121
Yes, mom?

1368
01:09:36,204 --> 01:09:39,121
I'm sorry. I hope we
didn't wake you up, mom.

1369
01:09:39,204 --> 01:09:40,537
Ahh.

1370
01:09:43,411 --> 01:09:47,578
I'll bet you do,
just bet you do.

1371
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:49,827
Of course we do.

1372
01:09:49,911 --> 01:09:52,869
We tried to be
as quiet as we could.

1373
01:09:52,952 --> 01:09:53,869
Carol couldn't sleep.

1374
01:09:53,952 --> 01:09:56,327
I came in
to tell her a story.

1375
01:09:56,409 --> 01:09:59,243
I know--I know what
you were doing!

1376
01:09:59,285 --> 01:10:03,658
Ha! Same thing you've been
doing all along, you filth!

1377
01:10:03,742 --> 01:10:06,617
You scum!

1378
01:10:06,658 --> 01:10:08,617
No wonder they all
hated you.

1379
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:10,949
They knew
what you were up to.

1380
01:10:11,033 --> 01:10:14,616
You didn't fool them! They
could see right through you!

1381
01:10:16,616 --> 01:10:19,573
They should have
killed you both.

1382
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:22,656
They should have just
smothered you in your cribs.

1383
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:24,697
You both should have been
strangled at birth! You!

1384
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:28,156
They should have killed you
in your bed!

1385
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:29,947
[squeals]
my babies.

1386
01:10:29,989 --> 01:10:31,779
You're rotten.
You're rotten.

1387
01:10:31,863 --> 01:10:33,654
You're both rotten!

1388
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:35,113
You don't know anything!

1389
01:10:35,155 --> 01:10:36,280
What are you saying?!

1390
01:10:36,322 --> 01:10:37,653
What is she saying?!

1391
01:10:37,737 --> 01:10:40,862
Carol: You're making
Marty upset, mom.

1392
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:43,362
You're making Marty upset.

1393
01:10:43,445 --> 01:10:47,028
I'll do a lot worse
than that, a lot worse.

1394
01:10:47,069 --> 01:10:49,361
Get out of here.

1395
01:10:49,444 --> 01:10:51,735
Don't you talk to me
like that, you devil.

1396
01:10:51,818 --> 01:10:53,484
Go to your room.

1397
01:10:53,568 --> 01:10:55,902
Don't you try
to tell me, Carol!

1398
01:10:55,943 --> 01:10:56,902
I'm your mother!

1399
01:10:56,985 --> 01:10:59,442
You go to your room!

1400
01:10:59,483 --> 01:11:01,026
Go to your room, mom.

1401
01:11:02,775 --> 01:11:03,692
Devil girl!

1402
01:11:03,775 --> 01:11:05,192
Go to your room.

1403
01:11:05,276 --> 01:11:07,108
I didn't mean it.
I'm sorry.

1404
01:11:07,150 --> 01:11:08,441
Oh, you meant it.

1405
01:11:08,482 --> 01:11:09,608
No, I didn't.

1406
01:11:09,649 --> 01:11:10,608
You mean it.

1407
01:11:10,649 --> 01:11:11,608
No, I didn't.

1408
01:11:11,649 --> 01:11:12,940
You go to
your goddamn room.

1409
01:11:12,982 --> 01:11:14,232
Don't you forget,
I’m your mother.

1410
01:11:14,316 --> 01:11:16,857
Are you?

1411
01:11:16,899 --> 01:11:18,190
Were you?

1412
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,189
It's time for you to go
to sleep now, mama.

1413
01:11:21,273 --> 01:11:22,731
No.

1414
01:11:22,772 --> 01:11:26,148
Marty! Oh, Carol.

1415
01:11:26,231 --> 01:11:28,605
It's time for you
to go to sleep, mama.

1416
01:11:28,688 --> 01:11:31,063
Carol.

1417
01:11:35,062 --> 01:11:38,229
This will make you feel
a whole lot better.

1418
01:11:38,271 --> 01:11:40,186
Carol, please.

1419
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:42,644
This will be good
for you, Ma.

1420
01:11:42,728 --> 01:11:44,436
It's just what you need.

1421
01:11:51,435 --> 01:11:53,935
Here you go, mama.

1422
01:11:54,019 --> 01:11:55,517
That's right.

1423
01:11:59,684 --> 01:12:03,641
Drink it all down, mama,
like a good girl.

1424
01:12:08,224 --> 01:12:09,515
Yes.

1425
01:12:09,599 --> 01:12:13,182
This one will make you feel
a whole lot better.

1426
01:12:20,639 --> 01:12:23,972
I feel--I feel better.

1427
01:12:24,014 --> 01:12:26,264
Thank you, Carol.

1428
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:31,762
My little girl.

Marty:
figuratively, at least,

1430
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:17,464
most people do die
of over sedation.

1431
01:13:17,548 --> 01:13:19,256
Fumbling about fearfully,

1432
01:13:19,298 --> 01:13:21,505
blindly they grasp
the sweet-smelling potions

1433
01:13:21,589 --> 01:13:23,505
handed down to them,
never look at the label,

1434
01:13:23,589 --> 01:13:25,754
and suddenly,
they're dead.

1435
01:13:25,796 --> 01:13:28,629
They die, natural deaths.

1436
01:13:29,796 --> 01:13:32,670
Everyone knew Mrs. Lakewood
had a weak heart.

1437
01:13:32,712 --> 01:13:33,795
Yes.

1438
01:13:33,837 --> 01:13:36,503
I told her that stuff
was dangerous, doctor,

1439
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:38,337
but she kept
going on and on,

1440
01:13:38,378 --> 01:13:40,044
"the pain, the pain."

1441
01:13:41,919 --> 01:13:44,128
It seems
she passed on quietly.

1442
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:45,211
That's a blessing.

1443
01:13:45,253 --> 01:13:47,210
Yes, it is, doctor.

1444
01:13:50,918 --> 01:13:52,667
Thank you, Martin.

1445
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:54,917

You Mr. Lakewood?

1447

Yeah. My mom's upstairs.

1448
01:14:08,332 --> 01:14:09,707
I'll be running along.

1449
01:14:09,748 --> 01:14:13,206
I'll file the "death
by natural causes" forms

1450
01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:15,539
with the county coroner.

1451
01:14:23,746 --> 01:14:25,371
Try not to drop her.

1452
01:14:25,413 --> 01:14:27,412
Don't, Marty.

1453
01:14:27,453 --> 01:14:28,996
Don't what?

1454
01:14:29,079 --> 01:14:30,996
Don't pretend
that it doesn't hurt

1455
01:14:31,079 --> 01:14:33,204
to see her like this.

1456
01:14:34,911 --> 01:14:36,828
I know you like to play

1458
01:14:39,995 --> 01:14:43,493

just a sentimental slob.

Yes, who is this?

This is Lois.

something wrong?

Yes, I know.

Will you please tell him
that I’m thinking of him?

Yes, of course.
I'll tell him.

Can you also tell him
that I will do that thing

that he asked me to do?

1495
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:12,355
Yes, I’ll tell him.

1496
01:16:12,438 --> 01:16:16,273
You'll be sure to do
the thing that he wanted,

She was a wonderful
Christian woman.

1532

She was a wonderful wife.

I didn't feel so well.

Never laid eyes on him.
Who'd he kill?

Harris: Show him
the other photo, captain.

01:21:12,312 --> 01:21:15,813
This is what getting stabbed
in the brain looks like.

1567

Not a pretty picture.

01:21:21,311 --> 01:21:23,603
Hmm. How about this?

1569
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:26,186
Who's he, another dead
private investigator?

1570
01:21:26,269 --> 01:21:27,560
Not a private
investigator.

1571
01:21:27,644 --> 01:21:29,228

I listen to quiz shows, too,

but I think I missed
the million-dollar question.

What people like Krutz
and Gibons and you

1577
01:21:38,892 --> 01:21:41,892
have in common is her.

What, my kid sister?

01:21:44,767 --> 01:21:47,390
That beef was for shoplifting
in New Orleans.

1580
01:21:47,474 --> 01:21:49,349
Well, it doesn't
do her justice.

1581
01:21:49,432 --> 01:21:50,849
You ought to see her
in the flesh.

People who see your sister,
like Krutz and Gibons,

1583
01:21:54,224 --> 01:21:56,807

1584
01:21:56,848 --> 01:21:58,598
People die and disappear
all the time.

1585
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,347
It doesn't mean she had
anything to do with it.

1586
01:22:00,430 --> 01:22:01,430
What is she--god?

1587
01:22:01,472 --> 01:22:02,806
She was here
as of noon yesterday,

1588
01:22:02,889 --> 01:22:03,847

She was upset.

1591
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:08,180
Was Krutz tailing her?

1592
01:22:08,222 --> 01:22:10,805
I don't know. She didn't
say anything about it.

1593
01:22:10,846 --> 01:22:14,137
You were seen yakking it up,
talking to her in town.

1594
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:16,553
She's my sister.
We're close. We talk.

1595
01:22:16,595 --> 01:22:19,929
We love each other. Is there
something wrong with that?

1596
01:22:20,012 --> 01:22:21,844
Not a thing.

1597
01:22:21,928 --> 01:22:23,969
Your sister's a hooker.

1598
01:22:24,053 --> 01:22:25,136
It's my understanding

1599
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:27,593
that one of Jesus Christ’s
best pals was a hooker.

1600
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:30,052
I didn't grill my sister
on where she makes her money

1601
01:22:30,093 --> 01:22:32,177
or where she spends
her free time,

1602
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:33,843
because I thought it was
in bad taste, lieutenant.

1603
01:22:33,927 --> 01:22:35,051
Tell me...

1604
01:22:35,134 --> 01:22:36,467
Where is the bitch?

1605
01:22:36,509 --> 01:22:39,092
I don't know.

1606
01:22:39,134 --> 01:22:42,008
I don't understand.
You're all brotherly love,

1607
01:22:42,050 --> 01:22:43,674
but you don't know
where your sister was

1608
01:22:43,758 --> 01:22:45,674
on the day of
your mother's burial.

1609
01:22:45,716 --> 01:22:49,298
No, I don't know.
I swear to god, I don't know!

1610
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:51,216
Bring in a stack of bibles,
I’ll swear on that!

1611
01:22:51,257 --> 01:22:53,840
I'll swear on the freckle
on the tip of your dick,

1612
01:22:53,882 --> 01:22:54,964
if you can find it!

1613
01:22:55,048 --> 01:22:56,380
Stop shouting.

1614
01:22:56,422 --> 01:22:58,256
Do you want to know
what happened,

1615
01:22:58,297 --> 01:22:59,923
do you want to know
the trouble

1616
01:23:00,006 --> 01:23:02,588
that your lovely sister
is in up to her neck?

1617
01:23:02,630 --> 01:23:04,963
At last, a reason for me
being here. Please.

1618
01:23:05,005 --> 01:23:06,588
A couple of nights ago,

1619
01:23:06,630 --> 01:23:08,214
she picked up
this guy Gibons

1620
01:23:08,296 --> 01:23:09,670
outside of
Claire’s cocktails.

1621
01:23:09,754 --> 01:23:10,962
Krutz over here
was tailing her,

1622
01:23:11,046 --> 01:23:12,087
and we're almost certain

1623
01:23:12,129 --> 01:23:14,004
that she got Gibons
to knock Krutz off.

1624
01:23:14,046 --> 01:23:16,170
You think she ran away
with Gibons?

1625
01:23:16,253 --> 01:23:18,045
We just
weren't sure.

1626
01:23:18,128 --> 01:23:20,669
You can't prove my sister
knew either of these guys!

1627
01:23:20,711 --> 01:23:22,294
For all you know, Gibons...

1628
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:24,794
Killed Krutz
in some jealous rage

1629
01:23:24,877 --> 01:23:27,044
and tried to pin it
on my sister.

1630
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:28,502
If you knew
the types of guys

1631
01:23:28,585 --> 01:23:30,001
my sister had to deal with
through her life,

1632
01:23:30,084 --> 01:23:32,626
you wouldn't be
so quick to judge her.

1633
01:23:32,709 --> 01:23:34,251
Do you mean any of what
you're saying, Lakewood?

1634
01:23:34,292 --> 01:23:36,210
Every last word, captain.

1635
01:23:36,251 --> 01:23:37,209
'Cause if you do,

1636
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:39,875
you'll contact us
if she contacts you?

1637
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:41,500
Of course I will.
I want her name

1638
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:43,832
cleared out of this mess
as soon as possible.

1639
01:23:43,916 --> 01:23:45,166
But you got to do one thing.

1640
01:23:45,249 --> 01:23:46,373
Let's hear it.

1641
01:23:46,457 --> 01:23:48,082
You can't watch me,
and you can't tail me.

1642
01:23:48,166 --> 01:23:49,874
'Cause if she did
do something wrong

1643
01:23:49,957 --> 01:23:52,664
or if she's scared 'cause
she knows someone who did,

1644
01:23:52,748 --> 01:23:55,040
then she's looking for a tail,
and she won't contact me.

1645
01:23:55,081 --> 01:23:56,331
She's gonna wait
till it's safe.

1646
01:23:56,372 --> 01:23:58,872
All right, Lakewood,
you win. No tail.

1647
01:23:58,914 --> 01:24:01,371
But if your sister
gets in touch,

1648
01:24:01,413 --> 01:24:03,080
and you don't let us
get to talk to her,

1649
01:24:03,164 --> 01:24:05,996
we're gonna have
to hammer you.

1650
01:24:06,079 --> 01:24:07,913
You got that?

1651
01:24:07,996 --> 01:24:10,913
Every last word.

1652
01:25:10,570 --> 01:25:13,820
[slow music
playing on radio]

1653
01:25:29,358 --> 01:25:31,525
[telephone rings]

1654
01:25:32,734 --> 01:25:34,193
Lois: Hello?

1655
01:25:35,441 --> 01:25:36,816
Yes?

1656
01:25:38,483 --> 01:25:41,733
Yes, this is Martin
Lakewood’s residence.

1657
01:25:44,482 --> 01:25:45,648
Yeah.

1658
01:25:45,732 --> 01:25:47,774
Uh, Marty, can you talk?

1659
01:25:47,857 --> 01:25:49,481
It's--it's, um...

1660
01:25:49,564 --> 01:25:52,689
It's some doctor
in--in Mexico.

1661
01:25:56,897 --> 01:25:59,063
It's about Carol,
darling.

1662
01:26:10,145 --> 01:26:13,394
Baby, I’m so sorry.

1663
01:26:17,685 --> 01:26:19,852
[water dripping]

1664
01:26:23,768 --> 01:26:25,934
[flies buzzing]

1665
01:26:26,018 --> 01:26:28,226
[people speaking Spanish]

1666
01:26:32,975 --> 01:26:34,808
Señor. Señor Lakewood.

1667
01:26:34,892 --> 01:26:37,640
Five months pregnant?

1668
01:26:37,682 --> 01:26:38,807
I don't know.

1669
01:26:38,849 --> 01:26:41,515
She--she tell me she's
barely three months.

1670
01:26:41,557 --> 01:26:44,848
She... she no show.
She's so small.

1671
01:26:44,890 --> 01:26:46,598
Yeah, well, if you were
any type of a real doctor,

1672
01:26:46,681 --> 01:26:47,806
you would know,
wouldn't you?

1673
01:26:47,848 --> 01:26:49,514
I am so sorry, señor.

1674
01:26:49,556 --> 01:26:51,223
I tried to do
my very best.

1675
01:26:51,264 --> 01:26:53,055
It doesn't really matter,
does it?

1676
01:26:53,139 --> 01:26:54,847
You got
the wrong number, pal.

1677
01:26:54,889 --> 01:26:56,181
You're talking
to the wrong party.

1678
01:26:56,222 --> 01:26:57,472
Wait, wait!

1679
01:26:57,555 --> 01:26:58,637
Wait for what?

1680
01:26:58,721 --> 01:26:59,804
What should I do?

1681
01:26:59,888 --> 01:27:01,013
I don't care what you do.

1682
01:27:01,096 --> 01:27:02,387
I don't know
what your grift is,

1683
01:27:02,429 --> 01:27:04,096
but I know there's some kind
of racket going on here.

1684
01:27:04,138 --> 01:27:05,428
If you don't leave me alone,

1685
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:07,220
I'm going to get
the authorities on you so fast,

1686
01:27:07,303 --> 01:27:08,928
it's going to make
your greasy head spin.

1687
01:27:08,970 --> 01:27:10,762
Abortion's illegal
in Mexico, too, you know.

1688
01:27:10,803 --> 01:27:13,886
Last time I looked,
it was a catholic country.

1689
01:27:13,969 --> 01:27:17,343
Señor, it has been
almost four days.

1690
01:27:17,385 --> 01:27:20,010
Please, the weather,
she's so hot.

1691
01:27:20,093 --> 01:27:21,718
And the smell...

1692
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:25,301
Throw it in the ocean,
throw it in a garbage dump,

1693
01:27:25,384 --> 01:27:26,717
throw it in the alley

1694
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,425
so the little dogs
can piss on it, OK?

1695
01:27:28,508 --> 01:27:30,467
You got the wrong party,
pal.

1696
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:31,967
But, señor, she's--
she's your family.

1697
01:27:32,050 --> 01:27:33,758
That hunk of meat you got
on your table there

1698
01:27:33,841 --> 01:27:35,257
is not my sister.

1699
01:27:35,299 --> 01:27:37,133
That's not
my sister Carol.

1700
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:39,883
I know exactly
where my sister is.

1701
01:27:39,966 --> 01:27:43,132
Please don't call
here again. Adios.

1702
01:27:43,174 --> 01:27:45,590
[muttering]

1703
01:27:53,505 --> 01:27:57,046
It's so tough...

1704
01:27:57,088 --> 01:27:58,337
Your sister
and your mother--

1705
01:27:58,379 --> 01:27:59,337
Unh!

1706
01:27:59,379 --> 01:28:01,879
Don't ever, ever
feel sorry for me!

1707
01:28:01,962 --> 01:28:03,378
Ever!

1708
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:04,545
Ever!

1709
01:28:04,587 --> 01:28:07,919
[sobbing]

1710
01:28:09,377 --> 01:28:10,461
Oh.

1711
01:28:10,544 --> 01:28:12,461
I'm sorry.

1712
01:28:12,502 --> 01:28:14,419
Marty: I'm sorry.

1713
01:28:14,461 --> 01:28:15,918
I'm sorry.

1714
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:17,626
[retching]

1715
01:28:22,084 --> 01:28:25,500
Let's go out
to my house, Marty.

1716
01:28:25,584 --> 01:28:27,292
You need to get away.

1717
01:28:27,333 --> 01:28:29,291
Marty: I seemed to be
falling into the darkness

1718
01:28:29,374 --> 01:28:31,041
that claimed my sister.

1719
01:28:31,125 --> 01:28:33,916
If Carol was lost,
then so was I.

1720
01:28:38,207 --> 01:28:41,082
Carol: Marty!

1721
01:28:53,621 --> 01:28:55,788
[crying]

1722
01:29:00,328 --> 01:29:01,620
Oh!

1723
01:29:02,495 --> 01:29:04,036
Oh!

1724
01:29:04,078 --> 01:29:06,244
[Marty crying]

1725
01:29:08,036 --> 01:29:09,578
[sobs]

1726
01:29:09,661 --> 01:29:14,326
Lois, don't cry. Oh, god,
don't cry. Don't--

1727
01:29:20,451 --> 01:29:22,451
It can't be fixed.

1728
01:29:24,034 --> 01:29:25,992
Oh, Marty...

1729
01:29:28,742 --> 01:29:31,907
How you must hate me.

1730
01:29:31,991 --> 01:29:34,615
I never hated anyone.

1731
01:29:50,905 --> 01:29:53,946
There aren't enough
tears for this sorrow.

1732
01:29:54,904 --> 01:29:56,946
Oh, Marty.

1733
01:30:17,943 --> 01:30:19,401
I want to tell you
something about my dad.

1734
01:30:19,484 --> 01:30:21,608
What's he got
to do with it?

1735
01:30:21,692 --> 01:30:25,984
No, honey, don't tell me
one of those crazy stories

1736
01:30:26,067 --> 01:30:29,524
about your past
and your family.

1737
01:30:29,607 --> 01:30:32,441
Yeah. It's just a story.
It's not true.

1738
01:30:32,524 --> 01:30:36,023
Let's just call it--
call it a story.

1739
01:30:36,107 --> 01:30:38,815
All right then,
if you have to.

1740
01:30:38,898 --> 01:30:43,564
He must have known sleeping
with another man's wife,

1741
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:48,105
I mean, a cop's wife,

1742
01:30:48,188 --> 01:30:50,730
would be more trouble
than it's worth.

1743
01:30:52,229 --> 01:30:54,730
[stairs creaking softly]

1744
01:31:05,686 --> 01:31:09,560
Now, tell me
the truth, Marty.

1745
01:31:09,643 --> 01:31:12,144
You don't think
I’m awful, do you?

1746
01:31:15,309 --> 01:31:18,184
That brother of mine,
he's just--

1747
01:31:18,225 --> 01:31:20,517
He's just nothing.

1748
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:23,474
It takes all kinds
to make up the world.

1749
01:31:23,516 --> 01:31:28,183
He's always been
so slow and stodgy.

1750
01:31:29,474 --> 01:31:32,348
Bet he moves fast now.

1751
01:31:32,432 --> 01:31:37,431
Told him I got offered
$30,000 for this house.

1752
01:31:38,848 --> 01:31:41,806
Yeah, that number will make
him move fast all right.

1753
01:31:45,471 --> 01:31:47,847
What the hell
is going on here?

1754
01:31:47,930 --> 01:31:50,304
Don't do it!

1755
01:32:28,507 --> 01:32:32,631
Captain miles Archer.

1756
01:32:33,756 --> 01:32:35,715

1757
01:32:37,548 --> 01:32:39,463
Stationed Hawaii.

1758
01:32:45,588 --> 01:32:47,462
A wedding photo.

1759
01:33:01,335 --> 01:33:03,544
You take
a nice photo, Lois.

1760
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:33,331
Woman: Precinct.
Can I help you?

1761
01:33:33,415 --> 01:33:37,831
Police? This is patrolwoman
Archer calling from home

1762
01:33:37,872 --> 01:33:41,455
at 175433 Wildwood Road.

1763
01:33:41,539 --> 01:33:44,287
There's been
a--a tragic accident.

1764
01:33:44,371 --> 01:33:46,538
A man's been shot.

1765
01:33:46,579 --> 01:33:48,246
It was my husband.

1766
01:33:48,287 --> 01:33:51,037
I was at home
with an acquaintance

1767
01:33:51,079 --> 01:33:53,745
and we heard a sound.
We thought it was a prowler.

1768
01:33:53,829 --> 01:33:55,786
I shot at a shadow.

1769
01:33:55,828 --> 01:33:58,661
I wasn't expecting a visit
from my husband.

1770
01:33:58,744 --> 01:34:00,953
Would you please
send a coroner right away?

1771
01:34:08,827 --> 01:34:11,242
It's gonna be all right,
Marty.

1772
01:34:16,991 --> 01:34:18,866
Marty: Lois' pals
down at headquarters

1773
01:34:18,950 --> 01:34:20,741
kept the heat off us.

1774
01:34:20,783 --> 01:34:22,866
Things went pretty smoothly
after that.

1775
01:34:22,908 --> 01:34:26,448
Realtor: The Farrells
are lovely people.

1776
01:34:26,532 --> 01:34:28,532
Your house will be
in good hands.

1777
01:34:34,823 --> 01:34:36,406
There you go.

1778
01:34:36,489 --> 01:34:39,738
And there you are.

1779
01:34:50,071 --> 01:34:52,277
Marty: These are the things
that happened.

1780
01:34:52,361 --> 01:34:54,528
Maybe they could have
turned out differently,

1781
01:34:54,569 --> 01:34:56,653
but why think about that?

1782
01:34:56,736 --> 01:34:59,902
This is the game
that changes as you play it.

1783
01:35:01,152 --> 01:35:03,152
God made it that way.

1784
01:35:03,235 --> 01:35:06,192
He rigged it.
We take the hits.

1785
01:35:09,275 --> 01:35:10,734
Oh, no.

1786
01:35:12,692 --> 01:35:13,692
I love you, Lois.

1787
01:35:13,775 --> 01:35:15,316
Move over.

1788
01:35:25,232 --> 01:35:27,314
Marty:
soon there would come night,

1789
01:35:27,398 --> 01:35:29,564
the lawn would be bright
in the moonlight.

1790
01:35:29,648 --> 01:35:32,481
The little girl would come
trudging across the grass.

1791
01:35:32,564 --> 01:35:35,188
It seemed
I could see her coming now.

1792
01:35:35,271 --> 01:35:38,563
She would be frightened
because she was alone,

1793
01:35:38,605 --> 01:35:41,021
and then
she would not be alone.

1794
01:35:41,105 --> 01:35:43,479
We were going away together.

1795
01:35:43,521 --> 01:35:45,521
We were
all going away together.
