something that's</i>

177
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:44,601
<i>gonna make you immediately
feel a little better.</i>

178
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:47,537
People tell you you can be
born gay; that's not true.

179
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:50,941
You cannot be born
a homosexual; this is a lie.

180
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:53,878
Now, I'm a counselor
and a pastor,

181
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,014
but was I born that way?

182
00:10:56,016 --> 00:10:57,882
(CHUCKLES):
No.

183
00:10:57,884 --> 00:11:01,620
It's behavioral. It's a choice.

184
00:11:01,622 --> 00:11:05,625
Cameron, you-you, uh,
play football?

185
00:11:05,627 --> 00:11:07,126
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

186
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:08,828
Were you born that way?

187
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,463
- No.
- No.

188
00:11:10,465 --> 00:11:13,800
Now, you chose to be
a football player, right?

189
00:11:13,802 --> 00:11:15,301
It's behavior.

190
00:11:15,303 --> 00:11:17,337
Now, if you... if Cameron
stops playing football,

191
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,040
he no longer is
a football player.

192
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:22,310
We got to learn for ourselves
where behavior comes from,

193
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:23,811
so we can cut it out,

194
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:27,148
and then we can no longer
be labeled that way.

195
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,918
Now, who could tell us
what a genogram is?

196
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,320
Phillip.

197
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:33,689
Well, a genogram's
like a family tree,

198
00:11:33,691 --> 00:11:37,060
only one that shows patterns
of family behavior as well.

199
00:11:37,062 --> 00:11:38,828
Sort of like
an illustrated one.

200
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:43,166
Yes. Now, we are going to draw
our family tree,

201
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:45,736
and we're gonna list
next to these people

202
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,738
their behavioral sin.

203
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,541
So, they made us...

204
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,178
and they labeled us,
so we're gonna label them.

205
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,216
Michael, can you read
the behavioral sins?

206
00:11:57,852 --> 00:12:01,219
We use the letters "SSA" or "H"

207
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:05,893
to label same sex attraction
or homosexuality.

208
00:12:05,895 --> 00:12:08,028
"D" for drugs.

209
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,798
A dollar sign for gambling.

210
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,300
"A," alcoholism.

211
00:12:13,302 --> 00:12:15,904
"P," promiscuity.

212
00:12:15,906 --> 00:12:18,606
"M," mental illness.

213
00:12:18,608 --> 00:12:21,777
Capital "A" lowercase "B"
for abortion.

214
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:24,814
Capital "P" lowercase "O"
for pornography.

215
00:12:24,816 --> 00:12:28,250
And "C" or "G,"
criminal or gang affiliation.

216
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:30,787
VICTOR: Forgetting "DV,"
domestic violence.

217
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:34,491
MICHAEL: Capital "D" lowercase
"V," domestic violence.

218
00:12:34,493 --> 00:12:36,760
VICTOR: Okay, guys,
let's dive right in.

219
00:12:36,762 --> 00:12:39,965
Let's grab some cards
and some markers.

220
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,768
I want you to write 'em down...

221
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,403
and put the letters
next to their name.

222
00:12:45,405 --> 00:12:47,438
I know they're family,

223
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,909
but I can guarantee that one
or some of these people

224
00:12:50,911 --> 00:12:54,249
are the reason that
you're at Love in Action.

225
00:12:55,684 --> 00:12:59,419
So, Jared, you must be
the preacher's son.

228
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:07,831
Uncle Chris is an alcoholic.

right there.

241
00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:47,306

I could stay at Chloe's

242
00:13:47,308 --> 00:13:49,477
when you go, instead?

243
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:53,981
It's okay,
I can stay at Wayne's.

244
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:56,083
- Or-or I'll just...
- I am okay with that.

245
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,853
In fact, I think
it is a great idea.

246
00:13:58,855 --> 00:14:00,721

th-these books, Jared,

898
00:55:02,435 --> 00:55:04,368
considering everything that's
going on for you right now,

899
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:06,437
I don't know that college
is really the best thing

900
00:55:06,439 --> 00:55:08,609
for you to be pursuing at all.

901
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:11,275
A year with us may be

902
00:55:11,277 --> 00:55:14,281
a much, much better use
of your time.

903
00:55:16,116 --> 00:55:19,952
Given everything that I see.

904
00:55:19,954 --> 00:55:22,958
And everything that's at stake.

905
00:55:24,525 --> 00:55:29,129
And I'm willing to say that
to your parents.

906
00:55:29,131 --> 00:55:31,465

wonderful conversations

907
00:55:31,467 --> 00:55:33,133
with your parents...
lovely people.

908
00:55:33,135 --> 00:55:36,037
So, I know some of the story,

909
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:39,708
and I know that there is
quite a discrepancy

910
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:44,346
between what they were told
and what you said.

911
00:55:44,348 --> 00:55:47,249
And you got to understand that

912
00:55:47,251 --> 00:55:49,218
they don't know
what to believe,

913
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,155
and that's very troubling
for them.

914
00:55:52,157 --> 00:55:55,358
But I think that you and I know

915
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,429
that there is a whole lot more
to the story,

916
00:55:58,431 --> 00:56:03,070
and, you know, we're not here
on mere thoughts alone.

917
00:56:06,507 --> 00:56:09,675
Jared, the-the people who get
the most out of this place

918
00:56:09,677 --> 00:56:13,947
are the people that are just
really brave and-and honest

919
00:56:13,949 --> 00:56:17,618
and-and lay everything on
the table, ugly as it seems,

920
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:20,756
and-and fess up
to what God already sees.

921
00:56:22,925 --> 00:56:25,927
And then I can
really truly assess

922
00:56:25,929 --> 00:56:28,465
what is the best future
for you.

923
00:56:31,468 --> 00:56:33,470

I'm, you know...
I am being prideful

I may never be a grandparent.

And that with my beliefs
and with all that's gone on,

1645
01:44:20,605 --> 01:44:24,976
I understand I-I may have
set myself up to lose you.

1646
01:44:24,978 --> 01:44:28,947
And I've had to ask myself,
and God,

1647
01:44:28,949 --> 01:44:31,150
if I'm ready for that.

1648

about nothing.

And neither of those things
are going to change.

1655

Okay? So let's deal with that.

1656
01:45:00,585 --> 01:45:02,418
Or let's call it a day.

1657
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:07,625
Both of us would be okay,
but that would be a shame.

God knows I tried.

if you really mean that...

...and you're not ready
to lose me...

1662
01:45:28,816 --> 01:45:30,315
then I'm sorry,

1663
01:45:30,317 --> 01:45:34,554

the one to change.

I understand.

1665
01:45:39,528 --> 01:45:41,530
