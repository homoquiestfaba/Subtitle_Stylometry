1
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:13,480
<i>Return to a place</i>
<i>where you are at peace</i>

2
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:17,050
<i>and reflect</i>
<i>on the idea of impermanence.</i>

3
00:00:17,819 --> 00:00:20,087
<i>The universe keeps moving</i>

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,289
<i>and nothing</i>
<i>will remain as it is,</i>

5
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:24,424
<i>good or bad.</i>

6
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:30,632
<i>By embracing inevitable change,</i>
<i>we free ourselves from anxiety.</i>

7
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:35,102
<i>Now,</i>
<i>take one more deep breath in.</i>

8
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:42,376
<i>One, two, three, four, five.</i>

9
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,145
<i>And out.</i>

10
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:51,819
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

11
00:00:53,588 --> 00:00:56,423
<i>I hope you enjoyed</i>
<i>this calming midday meditation,</i>

12
00:00:56,758 --> 00:00:58,793
<i>and that you welcome</i>
<i>the rest of your day</i>

13
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,563
<i>with love and compassion.</i>

14
00:01:02,697 --> 00:01:05,600
<i>And when you are ready,</i>
<i>open your eyes.</i>

15
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:10,772
Whatever you say, dude.

16
00:01:43,705 --> 00:01:45,238
Hello?

17
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:48,843
Shit, Cheryl.
It's the Jehovah's Witnesses.

18
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:50,444
Again? Weren't they just here?

19
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,747
I don't know.
Maybe it's the Mormons.

20
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,482
I just saw a smiling
young person with pamphlets.

21
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:58,720
- I looked out the window, but I don't think she saw me.
-  -What do we do?

22
00:01:58,753 --> 00:02:00,253
Hi.

23
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:04,157
I did see you,
and I can hear you.

24
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:06,226
I'm just selling solar panels.

25
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,831
That's just what they
say to make you open up.

26
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:11,498
No hablo ingles!

27
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:15,903
Go, go, go!
Maybe she won't notice.

28
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,610
Get in, get in!

29
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,528
Do you really think
the world is going to end?

30
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,430
No, I think we're doing great.

31
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:46,868
The Dow is breaking records,
so it's fine
that the planet is melting,

32
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:50,203
and think of all that empathy
we've learned from social media.

33
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:52,507
Didn't we talk
about the sarcasm?

34
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,676
Sarcasm is the least
of my problems.

35
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:57,912
Sarah, I know you're sick
of hearing me say this
over and over again,

36
00:02:57,945 --> 00:03:00,748
but you really need to accept
that there are certain things

37
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:03,417
that are always going
to be out of your control.

38
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:07,755
Why dwell on what
you cannot change?

39
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,991
Oh, I get it now.

40
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:14,862
So I just stop worrying and the
existential dread will vanish.

41
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,431
Why didn't I think of that?

42
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,499
Sarcasm.

43
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:21,334
Fine, okay, yeah.
I just won't think.

44
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,670
That's not what I said.

45
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:23,971
Well, it kind of is.

46
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:27,240
It's really hard
to think without worrying.

47
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,242
The world sucks,
haven't you noticed?

48
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:32,379
But for the thousandth time,
you can't control those things.

49
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,347
You shouldn't waste your energy.

50
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,450
Okay, but I do,

51
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,786
because what's the point
of putting any effort
into anything long term

52
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,588
if I'm not going
to make it to 50?

53
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,757
I mean, Jesus,

54
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,992
how the fuck do people
have kids in a world like this?

55
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:47,327
I mean, best case, right,

56
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:49,797
my body and mind
slowly fall apart.

57
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:53,701
And then I just die, I guess?

58
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,939
A lot of people your age
start to realize
that they won't live forever.

59
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:01,776
Maybe this is more
about you coming to terms
with your mortality.

60
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,378
I mean, I definitely don't
feel invincible anymore.

61
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,682
But dying doesn't sound
as bad as it used to.

62
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,784
Have you thought about
hurting yourself?

63
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:12,520
No.

64
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:15,489
No, no! That's not what I meant.

65
00:04:15,957 --> 00:04:17,658
Uh-huh. Well...

66
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,629
It's important
that you feel safe here

67
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,464
and know that you can
tell me anything.

68
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,434
No, really, I'm fine.

69
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:29,771
Okay, what I meant is

70
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,940
maybe death isn't
the worst thing possible.

71
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:39,346
Like I'm not afraid of dying
in the apocalypse as much
as I'm afraid of surviving it.

72
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,581
Meaning?

73
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,317
Okay, for example,
dying in a nuclear blast.

74
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,621
It's quick, you're ash before
you even knew it happened.

75
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:49,824
But trying to survive
in the radioactive hellscape
that comes after that?

76
00:04:52,994 --> 00:04:56,097
Yeah. Imagine having that
in your brain all the time,

77
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,298
then being told
to just not worry about it.

78
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,636
You need to focus more
on the real world.

79
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:05,840
Spend some time
with actual people.

80
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,308
I don't see
how that will help anything.

81
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:11,612
Sarah, people need people.

82
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:13,614
You need people.

83
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,351
All right, well,
we have to wrap it up.
Same time next week?

84
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:21,421
Isn't this supposed
to be making me feel better?

85
00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:23,356
It's a process.

86
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,792
Yeah, but...

87
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:29,931
I've been coming here every week
for the last two years,

88
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:33,668
-paying a small fortune
in co-pays.
-It takes time.

89
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,603
How much time?

90
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:38,906
Do you think
we've made progress?
Because I don't see any.

91
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,775
The progress
isn't always obvious.

92
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,580
But no, I don't think we've
quite found the breakthrough
we've been looking for yet.

93
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:49,482
-So you mean that...
-I'm sorry,
we're really out of time.

94
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:50,718
I'll see you next week.

95
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,426
Come on, I have
other shit to do, you know?

96
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,765
So, are you excited
for Friday night?

97
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,601
What's Friday night?

98
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:11,906
Fuck! I completely forgot.

99
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:13,406
Sure you did.

100
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,810
-Do I have to?
-Yes!

101
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:17,912
You need to get out more
and stop being such a hermit.

102
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:20,081
What's wrong
with being a hermit?

103
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,652
Ugh, who is this guy anyway?

104
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:26,621
My brother's friend Tucker.

105
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:30,423
He was just one of
the indistinguishable douchey
bros back in high school.

106
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:33,460
But now, he's
a successful entrepreneur

107
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:35,630
and somehow got very cute.

108
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,132
Your brother's friend? Really?

109
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,701
That's not confidence inspiring.

110
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:43,838
Yeah, I guess Brian
hasn't always been
the best judge of character.

111
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:46,641
-So I can bail?
-No.

112
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:48,809
You're going, end of debate.

113
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:51,444
Anyway, I'm sure
he's much more mature now.

114
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,515
-Just because you got fired
from your dream job...
-Laid off.

115
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:56,150
I was laid off.

116
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:59,053
Fired, laid off, whatever.

117
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:01,488
Having to sell shit door-to-door

118
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:03,758
doesn't give you an excuse to
stay mad at the world forever.

119
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,459
We need to get you
out of this rut.

120
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,095
Who says I'm in a rut?

121
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:09,563
Look at you.

122
00:07:09,964 --> 00:07:11,999
All the hope is drained
from your eyes.

123
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:14,068
Instead of enjoying
the best years of your life,

124
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:17,204
you're fast-tracking it
to the cat lady phase.

125
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:24,679
Look. Ever since we met on
the first day of kindergarten,

126
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:26,180
have I ever steered you wrong?

127
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:29,183
Yeah, fairly consistently.

128
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,886
And we only met
because you bit me.

129
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,154
Doesn't matter.

130
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:35,856
As your best friend, I insist.

131
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,225
Fine.

132
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:39,760
But I'm only doing this for you.

133
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:42,763
Yay! Trust me,
you'll have a great time.

134
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:44,632
I'll make sure
he texts you the deets.

135
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:47,034
Now come on,
I have to get in five miles
before it gets dark.

136
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,953
Sarah! How's it going?

137
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:09,657
Hey Barry, all right. You?

138
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,760
Feeling good, feeling good.
Just got back from Vermont.

139
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:15,763
Hey, I got some great shrooms
if you need any.

140
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,665
I'm good.

141
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:18,899
Thanks, though.

142
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:20,167
Cool. Cool.

143
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:25,773
Yeah, so also, I hate
to be like a capitalist but...

144
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,708
I need you get me
the rent at some point.

145
00:08:27,742 --> 00:08:30,745
Yeah, sorry, of course.
I'll get you a check tomorrow.

146
00:08:31,212 --> 00:08:33,948
Right on! Power to the people.

147
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,017
You too.

148
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,586
I mean... yeah.

149
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:56,804
<i>...discovered in the ruins</i>
<i>of ancient civilizations</i>

150
00:08:56,837 --> 00:09:00,107
<i>that contain technology</i>
<i>that is impossible for them</i>
<i>to have developed on their own.</i>

151
00:09:00,341 --> 00:09:03,277
<i>When you look at it objectively,</i>
<i>the only explanation</i>

152
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,147
<i>is the intervention</i>
<i>of a much more advanced race,</i>

153
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,117
<i>which in all likelihood would</i>
<i>have had to have been</i>
<i>extraterrestrial in origin.</i>

154
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:26,961
Yeah, so I have no idea
why my wife bothered calling you
in the first place.

155
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:29,763
We've never needed
any of this green bullshit.

156
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:31,632
And we certainly
don't need it now.

157
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,968
It's the god damned...

158
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:52,720
Hey, Mom.

159
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:54,188
<i>Hey honey, how's it going?</i>

160
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:58,692
Um, it's good,
just got done with work.

161
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:00,995
<i>Oh, good. Make any sales?</i>

162
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:02,163
What do you think?

163
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:04,365
<i>Oh, well, it'll get better soon.</i>

164
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:07,001
Probably not.

165
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:10,037
<i>You could always go back</i>
<i>to actually using</i>
<i>your very expensive degree.</i>

166
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:13,741
Nah, I enjoy
being underemployed.

167
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:18,179
<i>Oh, come on, you're capable</i>
<i>of so much more. I...</i>

168
00:11:18,212 --> 00:11:20,080
You know, I'm actually not
in the mood to be reminded

169
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:22,983
of my vast achievements
in underachieving.

170
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:25,219
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

171
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:30,324
<i>Just know that I believe</i>
<i>in you and think you're</i>
<i>amazingly smart and talented.</i>

172
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:32,760
<i>Do you have anything</i>
<i>planned for the weekend?</i>

173
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:35,796
Ugh. Yeah.
Thanks for reminding me.

174
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,431
<i>Oh yeah? What's going on?</i>

175
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:40,167
Kayla is forcing me
to go on a date
with her brother's friend.

176
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:43,137
<i>Oh, well! When is it?</i>

177
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:47,074
Tonight. Tried to get out
of it, but here I am.

178
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,976
<i>Have you picked a cute outfit?</i>

179
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,079
Hmm, I kind of figured I would
go with something casual.

180
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:53,781
Why not be myself, you know?

181
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:55,950
<i>Oh, come on.</i>
<i>You should get dressed up.</i>

182
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:58,252
<i>You only get</i>
<i>one first impression.</i>

183
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,987
Yes, Mother.

184
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,756
<i>Don't "Yes, Mother" me.</i>
<i>You know I'm right.</i>

185
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:40,361
Just not him, not him.
Please not him, not him.

186
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,503
Fuck.

187
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:53,774
Hey, you must be Sarah.

188
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:56,443
-Tucker?
-The one and only.

189
00:12:57,378 --> 00:13:00,481
Sorry. I was running a bit late.
Have you been waiting long?

190
00:13:00,515 --> 00:13:03,817
Oh, it's no problemo.
I threw back a few brews.

191
00:13:04,018 --> 00:13:05,853
You know, they got
a great beer list.

192
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:09,290
Oh, that's... cool, I guess.

193
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:11,425
Oh, well sorry again
for running behind.

194
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,193
Do you want to see
if our table's ready?

195
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:15,429
You sure you don't want
a drink first?

196
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:19,933
Uh, well,
I'm pretty hungry and...

197
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,869
Come on, just one drink.

198
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,338
You look like a vodka soda girl.
Hey Tiffany...

199
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:29,943
Uh no, I am
actually trying to stay away
from alcohol right now.

200
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:32,913
Oh. Weird.

201
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,450
Well, let's do
this thing, right?

202
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:39,119
Mmm.

203
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:51,533
So we sold that company
last year, which left me
pretty flush with cash.

204
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:56,136
I traveled for a while, saw some
pretty amazing places and...

205
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,306
Oh, have you ever been
to Ecuador?

206
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,308
I've been to Canada.

207
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:04,078
Oh. Yeah, that's cool, I guess.

208
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:08,550
Anyways, you should definitely
check out South America
if you get the chance.

209
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:15,222
Spending time with the natives
was just so... sick.

210
00:14:15,657 --> 00:14:17,224
I can't even explain.

211
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:20,294
Anyways, I thought I had
everything I ever wanted

212
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:25,065
and I just started to feel
kind of empty inside.

213
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:26,534
Like nothing was doing it
for me, you know?

214
00:14:26,568 --> 00:14:28,001
Thanks.

215
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:33,073
Anyways, I just wanted
to do something
that mattered, you know?

216
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:35,008
So that's when I started
my new company.

217
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:40,214
And what's this new company?

218
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:46,320
We offer
an instant delivery service
for locally sourced IPAs.

219
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,556
Uh-huh.

220
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:54,061
I mean, it's going great so far,
and it feels really rewarding
doing something.

221
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:55,896
It's like building
the community.

222
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,232
Something to make
a difference, you know?

223
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,434
Now, I don't really do
any of the delivering

224
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,637
or the lifting or the funding,

225
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:06,373
but luckily the investors
hopped right on board
for this one, so...

226
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:09,943
Looks like we'll have
a pretty big payday
when we sell in a few years.

227
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,280
Mm-hm.

228
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:18,720
Anyways, now that we had this
nice meal, what do you say we go
back to my place and smash?

229
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:26,360
I know. You want some of this.

230
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:30,330
Uh... no, thanks.

231
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:34,536
-Really?
-Yeah. I just want to go home.

232
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:39,641
Wait, I buy you this nice meal
and you're not even gonna
let me hit that?

233
00:15:39,674 --> 00:15:42,009
I wasn't planning on it, no.

234
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,511
That's pretty weak.

235
00:15:43,545 --> 00:15:45,580
Uh, okay, yeah.
You want to go home?

236
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:47,515
We can go back
to your place, I guess.

237
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:49,617
I'm sorry, I need to ask this,
you know, for clarity.

238
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,286
Do you think this went well?

239
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:55,322
Well... yeah.

240
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:59,026
I mean, like, I'm a nine, right?

241
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:03,497
And you're like, maybe, a six
on a good day.

242
00:16:03,731 --> 00:16:05,700
So yeah, I thought
it was a pretty sure bet.

243
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:07,367
Really?

244
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:13,040
Okay. Uh, wow.

245
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:18,145
Um, so first off, I sat here
and kept my mouth shut

246
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:21,583
and indulged
about an hour of your
startup bro bragging bullshit

247
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:23,551
about
how you're saving the world

248
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:25,720
delivering shitty beer
to a bunch of hipsters

249
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:28,288
living in apartments
paid for by their parents.

250
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:33,093
It's a stupid business idea,
and frankly, it's not giving
back to the community.

251
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,229
They can just walk
to the fucking store.

252
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:37,765
And second off,
you're like an eight, all right?
Okay, at best.

253
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,466
So just fucking
get over yourself.

254
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,603
Look, okay.
That's pretty harsh, babe.

255
00:16:42,236 --> 00:16:45,038
And don't fucking call me babe.

256
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:47,575
Relax, sweetie.

257
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:49,376
Why don't we
just go back to my place?

258
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,613
-We'll have a drink.
-Seriously?

259
00:16:51,646 --> 00:16:53,413
Yeah. Let's go.

260
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:55,650
You, you don't get it,
all right?

261
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:59,186
You are a walking example
of everything
that is wrong with this world.

262
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:02,757
I would gladly
push you off a cliff
before I slept with you.

263
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:08,195
So you can just go home,
turn on some weird Japanese porn
and literally fuck yourself.

264
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:13,467
And also, what the hell kind
of rich guy tips ten percent?

265
00:17:16,738 --> 00:17:20,307
Whoo, cuckoo.

266
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:23,811
Must be that time of the month,
you know what I mean?

267
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:41,783
<i>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen!</i>
<i>It's your favorite host here.</i>

268
00:19:41,816 --> 00:19:44,351
<i>And it is so, so great</i>
<i>to be with you tonight.</i>

269
00:19:45,586 --> 00:19:48,756
<i>Thank you, thank you, yeah.</i>

270
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:52,994
<i>Now you all know</i>
<i>that I love to joke around.</i>

271
00:19:53,027 --> 00:19:55,462
<i>I'm a jokester.</i>

272
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:58,633
<i>But tonight I've got</i>
<i>to talk to you</i>
<i>about something very serious.</i>

273
00:20:00,935 --> 00:20:04,505
<i>I know, I know.</i>
<i>But today we are going</i>
<i>to discuss something called...</i>

274
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:07,742
<i>simulated reality.</i>

275
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:10,611
<i>To explain, let's go</i>
<i>to my colleague in the field.</i>

276
00:20:10,645 --> 00:20:13,681
<i>The basic concept</i>
<i>of simulated reality</i>

277
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:15,415
<i>is exactly what it sounds like.</i>

278
00:20:17,018 --> 00:20:20,722
<i>A manufactured</i>
<i>version of reality,</i>
<i>which is in fact not real.</i>

279
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:24,559
<i>In our case,</i>
<i>a highly developed race</i>

280
00:20:24,592 --> 00:20:28,529
<i>have used advanced</i>
<i>computing technologies</i>
<i>to create simulations</i>

281
00:20:28,563 --> 00:20:31,431
<i>full of generations of people</i>
<i>living entire lifetimes</i>

282
00:20:31,465 --> 00:20:34,769
<i>under the impression</i>
<i>that their worlds</i>
<i>are in fact real.</i>

283
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:38,238
<i>Now why would they do this,</i>
<i>you might ask.</i>

284
00:20:38,606 --> 00:20:41,876
<i>In our example,</i>
<i>this advanced race</i>

285
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:44,579
<i>is looking back into their past</i>

286
00:20:44,846 --> 00:20:48,750
<i>to determine how different</i>
<i>variables might have impacted</i>
<i>their development.</i>

287
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:54,689
<i>A way to understand</i>
<i>all of a world's</i>
<i>possible alternate histories.</i>

288
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,792
<i>And now, back to you</i>
<i>in the studio.</i>

289
00:20:57,825 --> 00:20:59,292
<i>How about that?</i>

290
00:20:59,627 --> 00:21:01,428
<i>Yes, it's truly amazing.</i>

291
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:05,900
<i>And it's my duty today</i>
<i>to inform you that your world,</i>

292
00:21:06,768 --> 00:21:09,504
<i>your entire existence,</i>
<i>is just one of those</i>

293
00:21:09,537 --> 00:21:14,008
<i>billions upon billions</i>
<i>of simulated realities created</i>
<i>by humans of the future.</i>

294
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:17,344
<i>Isn't that something?</i>

295
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:20,313
<i>Now I know this sounds</i>
<i>a little out there,</i>

296
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:22,449
<i>and you could use some proof.</i>

297
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,552
<i>So I'm gonna</i>
<i>give you some proof.</i>
<i>It's what I'm here for.</i>

298
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:28,321
<i>You are all now</i>
<i>holding a banana.</i>

299
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,860
That's stupid.
Holy fucking what?

300
00:21:32,894 --> 00:21:35,029
<i>I hope you're still with us.</i>

301
00:21:35,563 --> 00:21:39,033
<i>- Please. enjoy that banana.</i>
<i>- It's good for you.</i>

302
00:21:39,901 --> 00:21:43,538
<i>Unfortunately, all good things</i>
<i>must come to an end,</i>

303
00:21:43,571 --> 00:21:45,940
<i>and it's with a heavy heart</i>
<i>that I notify you</i>

304
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:49,442
<i>that your simulation</i>
<i>will be discontinued</i>
<i>exactly one week...</i>

305
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:54,447
<i>From now.</i>

306
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:56,784
<i>Yes, it's too bad.</i>

307
00:21:56,818 --> 00:21:58,820
<i>It is really a shame.</i>

308
00:21:58,853 --> 00:22:03,591
<i>In accordance with the Simulated</i>
<i>Consciousness Act of 3112,</i>

309
00:22:04,025 --> 00:22:07,795
<i>all sentient inhabitants</i>
<i>must be made aware of the</i>
<i>nature of their existence</i>

310
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:10,463
<i>before the termination</i>
<i>of a simulation,</i>

311
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:14,467
<i>which means you are getting</i>
<i>provided with a wonderful,</i>
<i>wonderful choice.</i>

312
00:22:14,502 --> 00:22:17,470
<i>To see what it is, let's check</i>
<i>in with some friends of mine.</i>

313
00:22:17,972 --> 00:22:20,041
<i>You know, we've got some really</i>
<i>great stuff for you tonight.</i>

314
00:22:20,074 --> 00:22:22,009
<i>Some really great stuff.</i>

315
00:22:22,043 --> 00:22:24,645
<i>So first up is Option A.</i>

316
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:26,781
<i>You remain here</i>
<i>in the abandoned simulation</i>
<i>without any outside influence.</i>

317
00:22:26,814 --> 00:22:29,083
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>Everything's up to you.</i>

318
00:22:29,116 --> 00:22:31,752
<i>That sounds like a hard life</i>
<i>if you ask me.</i>

319
00:22:31,786 --> 00:22:33,521
<i>But legally,</i>
<i>we do have to offer it.</i>

320
00:22:33,988 --> 00:22:37,992
<i>Now, what most of you are going</i>
<i>to be interested in is Option B.</i>

321
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:42,697
<i>We take your consciousness</i>
<i>and we transfer it to a simpler,</i>
<i>more efficient system,</i>

322
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:46,567
<i>where you get to relive</i>
<i>your five greatest memories</i>
<i>over and over</i>

323
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:48,002
<i>without any kind of awareness.</i>

324
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:50,605
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>Pure bliss, forever.</i>

325
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:53,574
<i>Thank you, folks.</i>

326
00:22:53,608 --> 00:22:57,578
<i>Oh, I told you,</i>
<i>we're doing everything we can</i>
<i>to take care of you.</i>

327
00:22:59,013 --> 00:23:01,749
<i>Now I know this is a lot, it is.</i>

328
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:04,752
<i>But I have just one more</i>
<i>surprise for you.</i>
<i>Just one more.</i>

329
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:09,957
<i>Each and every one of you</i>
<i>is going to get</i>
<i>your own personal Guide.</i>

330
00:23:09,991 --> 00:23:13,728
<i>This Guide will</i>
<i>answer your questions.</i>

331
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:16,764
<i>This Guide will make sure you</i>
<i>have everything that you need</i>

332
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:21,535
<i>to move on to your next phase,</i>
<i>whatever you choose.</i>

333
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:24,605
<i>It has been wonderful</i>

334
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:27,708
<i>I do wish you all the best.</i>

335
00:23:27,742 --> 00:23:30,978
<i>Ooh, your Guides</i>
<i>will be arriving any moment.</i>

336
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:37,018
<i>Please have a wonderful night</i>
<i>and I'll see you real soon.</i>

337
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:16,924
Hello.

338
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:19,226
-Hi.
-May I come in?

339
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:42,650
So... You're the guy
from the TV?

340
00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:44,852
Yes and no.

341
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:46,253
I look like the guy from the TV.

342
00:24:47,955 --> 00:24:49,156
Okay.

343
00:24:49,724 --> 00:24:51,592
I'm an artificial
intelligence program.

344
00:24:54,295 --> 00:24:55,663
So are you...

345
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:58,498
well,

346
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,604
you're more
mellow than the TV guy.

347
00:25:04,305 --> 00:25:07,008
I look like the host to make it
easier for you to process.

348
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:10,644
But my program has been
tuned to your specific
personality profile

349
00:25:10,678 --> 00:25:12,880
to aid you in the
discontinuation process.

350
00:25:14,782 --> 00:25:17,985
Makes sense.
This all makes sense. Cool.

351
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:19,987
Cool.

352
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:23,057
I was being sarcastic. Whatever.

353
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:25,559
Do you have any other questions?

354
00:25:25,593 --> 00:25:27,194
You can ask me
anything you want.

355
00:25:27,228 --> 00:25:32,233
Uh... no, I think I've got
all this sorted, thank you.

356
00:25:32,266 --> 00:25:34,035
Fantastic. Just in case,

357
00:25:34,068 --> 00:25:36,270
I am going to remain here
until you make a decision.

358
00:25:36,303 --> 00:25:39,040
Uh... No, no, no.

359
00:25:39,073 --> 00:25:40,274
That's really, that's okay.

360
00:25:40,307 --> 00:25:42,043
It is our standard procedure.

361
00:25:42,843 --> 00:25:45,579
-Do I get a say in this?
-No.

362
00:25:45,613 --> 00:25:47,281
But why would you
not want free help?

363
00:25:48,783 --> 00:25:51,252
That's a reasonable question
I've never
had a good answer for.

364
00:25:52,153 --> 00:25:55,256
I guess privacy
was the big thing.

365
00:25:56,357 --> 00:25:58,659
But if all the shit
you're saying is true,

366
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,996
none of that matters anyway.

367
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:03,664
Exactly.

368
00:26:04,732 --> 00:26:06,901
So we all have to deal with you
or some version of you.

369
00:26:07,268 --> 00:26:09,637
That is correct.

370
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,872
Won't it get kind of chaotic
having twice as many
people in the world?

371
00:26:11,906 --> 00:26:12,973
What do you mean?

372
00:26:15,276 --> 00:26:17,078
Right.

373
00:26:17,111 --> 00:26:19,213
People will only be able to see
and hear their own Guides.

374
00:26:19,747 --> 00:26:21,649
We have done this before,
do not worry.

375
00:26:21,682 --> 00:26:24,852
You've done this before?
How many times?

376
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:26,754
Would it make a difference?

377
00:26:26,787 --> 00:26:29,356
Yeah. No?

378
00:26:31,692 --> 00:26:33,094
Maybe.

379
00:26:34,028 --> 00:26:35,729
I don't know. Um...

380
00:26:36,163 --> 00:26:39,600
Okay.
Well, I guess I'm just gonna

381
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:43,237
go to bed and hope
that this is all a dream.

382
00:26:44,905 --> 00:26:46,740
I'm guessing you're just
going to be here?

383
00:26:47,141 --> 00:26:48,409
That is correct.

384
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:50,411
Do you want to sleep
on the couch?

385
00:26:50,444 --> 00:26:52,913
I do not require food or sleep.

386
00:26:52,947 --> 00:26:54,081
Uh-huh.

387
00:26:54,982 --> 00:26:56,684
That makes sense, I guess.

388
00:26:57,852 --> 00:27:00,955
So you're just gonna
sit here till morning?

389
00:27:00,988 --> 00:27:02,756
That is correct.

390
00:27:06,193 --> 00:27:11,932
114,225,700,604.

391
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,735
What?

392
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:16,804
That is how many times
we have done this before.

393
00:27:19,173 --> 00:27:23,043
Or at least that is how many
times my program has been used.

394
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:24,912
Uh-huh.

395
00:27:25,412 --> 00:27:26,747
Great.

396
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:31,886
Well... make yourself at home.

397
00:27:32,353 --> 00:27:33,721
Or whatever.

398
00:27:34,388 --> 00:27:37,825
And I guess, good night?

399
00:27:37,858 --> 00:27:39,160
Good night.

400
00:27:49,303 --> 00:27:52,339
Everyone's getting so
worked up about this, but...

401
00:27:53,908 --> 00:27:55,976
is it really
that much of a surprise?

402
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,179
I mean, if anything,
I feel like it explains a lot.

403
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:03,417
And it actually
makes me feel a little better.

404
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:07,988
I mean, I'm not going to pretend
the last few days haven't
been weird as shit, but...

405
00:28:09,323 --> 00:28:13,394
I don't know, I feel like I'm
the only person on the planet
that's still acting...

406
00:28:14,128 --> 00:28:16,830
kind of normal.

407
00:28:17,264 --> 00:28:19,833
Sort of a weird reversal to
suddenly feel like the sane one.

408
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:28,776
I guess if I never really
had control over anything,

409
00:28:29,843 --> 00:28:35,149
none of this, whatever is wrong
with me, was my fault.

410
00:28:37,451 --> 00:28:38,852
Maybe you were right.

411
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,789
Maybe I can stop worrying about
the things that I can't control

412
00:28:41,822 --> 00:28:47,061
because apparently no one
in the entire world has ever
had control over anything.

413
00:28:48,095 --> 00:28:50,764
Right. Yeah, that sounds good.

414
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:55,102
Were you listening
to any of that?

415
00:28:55,135 --> 00:28:57,071
No. Yeah.

416
00:28:57,104 --> 00:29:00,107
I'm sorry.
I'm just a little preoccupied.

417
00:29:01,108 --> 00:29:02,476
I can tell.

418
00:29:03,844 --> 00:29:06,814
Whatever happened
to not worrying about
what you can't control?

419
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:09,450
You used to tell me that
like five times a session.

420
00:29:09,483 --> 00:29:11,385
Of course I did.

421
00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:16,790
But that was back
before every single thing
in our existence was a lie.

422
00:29:17,592 --> 00:29:19,326
And just because
I said it doesn't mean...

423
00:29:20,261 --> 00:29:21,795
You don't know my...

424
00:29:22,396 --> 00:29:24,999
Weren't you going
to kill yourself anyway?

425
00:29:25,032 --> 00:29:28,202
-Uh...
-They've given you an out.

426
00:29:28,235 --> 00:29:29,837
You don't have to do it anymore.

427
00:29:30,037 --> 00:29:32,139
They, whoever
the fuck "they" are,

428
00:29:32,172 --> 00:29:33,974
will just do it for you

429
00:29:34,008 --> 00:29:36,176
and then send you into some
never-ending fantasy loop.

430
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,079
It's bullshit!
You've got it easy.

431
00:29:39,113 --> 00:29:42,517
The rest of us,
those of us who actually
give a shit about life,

432
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:47,187
are being, I don't know,
just a little bit
fucking inconvenienced.

433
00:29:47,221 --> 00:29:49,890
I mean, at least we're getting
an easy choice, sure,

434
00:29:49,923 --> 00:29:53,894
but still, just busting into
our lives and telling us we have
to choose in the first place?

435
00:29:53,927 --> 00:29:55,829
We shouldn't have
to deal with that shit!

436
00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:57,331
So you're going with Option B?

437
00:29:59,534 --> 00:30:00,968
Of course I am.

438
00:30:01,435 --> 00:30:03,170
Interesting.

439
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:06,006
Not really sure
what I'm gonna do yet.

440
00:30:07,408 --> 00:30:08,976
Oh?

441
00:30:09,343 --> 00:30:13,180
Now that is funny.

442
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:17,051
I don't know that
it was supposed to be.

443
00:30:17,084 --> 00:30:18,919
It's just so you.

444
00:30:19,253 --> 00:30:22,557
Easy choice, but you have
to make it complicated.

445
00:30:23,123 --> 00:30:27,161
There's no way in your mind
that the rest of the world
could be right.

446
00:30:27,194 --> 00:30:29,830
-I just--
-What is it
with your generation, anyway?

447
00:30:30,464 --> 00:30:35,402
You spend all of your time
complaining about how
we boomers need to shut up

448
00:30:35,436 --> 00:30:39,139
and stop telling you what to do
and that we don't understand.

449
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:44,378
But then, you come
to places like this,
to pay people like me

450
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:46,413
to tell you
what you're doing wrong,

451
00:30:46,447 --> 00:30:49,416
and you still don't listen!

452
00:30:51,118 --> 00:30:53,220
I don't think I've ever really
said it out loud before,

453
00:30:53,253 --> 00:30:57,391
but you are just
a bunch of self-absorbed,
know-it-all assholes!

454
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:00,394
It's exhausting.

455
00:31:00,427 --> 00:31:02,129
Uh...

456
00:31:02,162 --> 00:31:04,131
I can't fucking believe
this is happening!

457
00:31:05,165 --> 00:31:06,967
What was the point of it all?

458
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:10,304
By the way,
what are you doing here?

459
00:31:10,705 --> 00:31:12,172
I'm not even seeing patients.

460
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:15,275
I'm just in here
trying to get my shit in order.

461
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:17,612
You barged in
and started talking
like everything was normal.

462
00:31:17,645 --> 00:31:19,413
This is the last thing
I need right now.

463
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:23,384
Oh.

464
00:31:25,085 --> 00:31:27,154
Well, I guess I just thought...

465
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:34,361
Well, in that case,
I should probably go?

466
00:31:34,395 --> 00:31:37,030
Yeah, probably.

467
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:38,700
Same time next week?

468
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:40,901
There won't be a next week.

469
00:31:41,135 --> 00:31:44,506
And I can't believe I wasted
all the weeks I did have
on fuckups like you.

470
00:31:45,406 --> 00:31:47,274
Right, okay.

471
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:49,943
So bye, then?

472
00:31:49,977 --> 00:31:52,580
Fuck off.

473
00:31:59,621 --> 00:32:01,121
Leave a check!

474
00:32:02,657 --> 00:32:05,092
The co-payment is 40 dollars!

475
00:32:11,064 --> 00:32:12,966
Did everything go well?

476
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,368
Fuck!

477
00:32:16,303 --> 00:32:18,706
I think maybe we should
give him some space.

478
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,179
Here's your Red Eye.

479
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:28,182
Thank you.
I really needed this today.

480
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,251
You know, I was actually amazed
to see you guys were still open.

481
00:32:31,285 --> 00:32:33,353
-What do you mean?
-I don't know.

482
00:32:33,387 --> 00:32:35,657
I just kind of figured no one
would want to go to work
anymore.

483
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,090
I didn't.

484
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:40,327
Wait. So you just stopped going?

485
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,397
Yeah. I mean, it's not like
they're sending out
paychecks anymore.

486
00:32:44,231 --> 00:32:45,399
Hmph.

487
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:54,208
So how many people
usually end up staying?

488
00:32:54,241 --> 00:32:56,744
I'm sorry, but I cannot
answer that accurately.

489
00:32:57,645 --> 00:32:59,714
It varies
from simulation to simulation,

490
00:32:59,747 --> 00:33:01,683
but it is
usually a very small number.

491
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:04,652
Most who choose to stay
do not see another person,

492
00:33:05,553 --> 00:33:08,021
at least those who do not stay
with family or a partner.

493
00:33:08,756 --> 00:33:10,758
But people rarely stay together.

494
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:13,393
Finally, my chance
to be left alone.

495
00:33:14,194 --> 00:33:16,396
-Perhaps.
-It sounds so nice.

496
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:19,601
You can make that choice
if you think it is
right for you.

497
00:33:19,634 --> 00:33:22,336
Ooh, I have a funny question.

498
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:26,608
So if you've done this
a bunch of times, have you met
another version of me?

499
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:29,176
I am sorry,
I cannot answer that.

500
00:33:29,209 --> 00:33:31,078
Oh come on, why not?

501
00:33:31,111 --> 00:33:33,548
I am here to help you
make your decision,

502
00:33:33,581 --> 00:33:35,583
but it might create
excess bias if you knew.

503
00:33:36,216 --> 00:33:38,118
So you have met
another version of me.

504
00:33:38,786 --> 00:33:41,255
You cannot trick me
into answering.

505
00:33:41,288 --> 00:33:42,624
Okay, okay.

506
00:33:42,657 --> 00:33:44,391
I read you loud and clear.

507
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,261
I did not say anything.

508
00:33:48,228 --> 00:33:49,797
Oh, it's Kayla.

509
00:33:51,265 --> 00:33:52,767
She wants me to meet her
in the park.

510
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,402
She's been so flaky
the last couple of days.

511
00:33:55,435 --> 00:33:58,740
All right. Oh,
do you want anything to go?

512
00:33:59,641 --> 00:34:01,208
I do not require food or--

513
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:03,377
I know, I'm just fucking
with you, come on.

514
00:34:16,156 --> 00:34:17,457
The fuck?

515
00:34:22,296 --> 00:34:23,731
Hey Kay.

516
00:34:24,364 --> 00:34:25,567
What's with the jumpsuits?

517
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:27,569
Sarah!

518
00:34:27,602 --> 00:34:30,270
It is so wonderful you are here.

519
00:34:30,304 --> 00:34:32,172
Bless the creators.

520
00:34:32,205 --> 00:34:34,341
This is my new friend, Otto.

521
00:34:34,374 --> 00:34:39,881
Otto, this is my best friend
from our journey
through this world, Sarah.

522
00:34:39,914 --> 00:34:41,448
Hi, Otto.

523
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:44,284
Bless the creators
or whatever she said.

524
00:34:44,318 --> 00:34:45,787
Oh, I'm good, thank you.

525
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,422
So who are these creators?

526
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:52,794
They are those that have
created all of this.

527
00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:56,764
It is also through their mercy
that we will live on
through the infinite.

528
00:34:57,297 --> 00:35:00,334
They are great.
Bless the creators!

529
00:35:00,868 --> 00:35:03,871
Okay, cool.

530
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:07,207
Join us in our praise
of their greatness.

531
00:35:07,642 --> 00:35:10,277
I think I'll pass, thanks.

532
00:35:12,412 --> 00:35:13,581
Did he brainwash you?

533
00:35:13,781 --> 00:35:15,349
Are you good?

534
00:35:15,783 --> 00:35:18,820
I have never felt better
in my entire existence.

535
00:35:19,654 --> 00:35:20,688
Can't argue with that.

536
00:35:21,488 --> 00:35:24,324
Um, so what does your Guide
have to say about this?

537
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:26,193
Doesn't he know
all about the creators?

538
00:35:27,227 --> 00:35:28,863
He is my direct
connection to them.

539
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:33,601
We are in a deep, complex,
committed relationship.

540
00:35:34,434 --> 00:35:39,774
We are one and because of him,
I'm one with the creators.

541
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:43,143
It is highly erotic.

542
00:35:43,745 --> 00:35:45,713
She is definitely
making that part up.

543
00:35:46,648 --> 00:35:49,651
Well, I've got to say, you guys
seem really busy over here,

544
00:35:49,684 --> 00:35:51,753
so I'm just going to go.

545
00:35:52,386 --> 00:35:53,955
Is that okay with the creators?

546
00:35:53,988 --> 00:35:56,490
They have granted you free will,

547
00:35:56,524 --> 00:35:59,393
and you are free to do
with that as you wish.

548
00:35:59,426 --> 00:36:02,864
Except they haven't, though,
because like all this shit,

549
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:05,465
we're living in a simula...

550
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:07,902
You know what? It's fine.
Why don't you just let me know

551
00:36:07,935 --> 00:36:11,706
when you need a break
from dancing in the park
or whatever is happening here?

552
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,675
See you later.

553
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:15,543
I'll see you later as well,

554
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,780
as we relive our greatest
moments together

555
00:36:19,013 --> 00:36:21,248
in the boundless expanse...

556
00:36:22,482 --> 00:36:24,217
beyond time.

557
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,523
Right. Sounds like a plan.

558
00:36:30,892 --> 00:36:32,760
-Does that always happen?
-Yes.

559
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:35,596
- Every time?
- Yes.

560
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,965
Some people need it to wrap
their heads around the unknown.

561
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:40,668
Huh. Nothing new there.

562
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:48,943
My God, it's nice to be home.

563
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:51,378
Everyone's
losing their shit out there.

564
00:36:51,946 --> 00:36:54,682
We always anticipate a wide
array of reactions to the news.

565
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:57,852
Yeah, I think I'm going to like
the world a lot better
without other people.

566
00:36:58,553 --> 00:36:59,787
Perhaps.

567
00:37:00,287 --> 00:37:02,289
It is difficult to make it
out there on your own.

568
00:37:02,657 --> 00:37:04,525
People tend to struggle
without other people.

569
00:37:04,892 --> 00:37:08,462
Dude, the hardest part
of my life right now
is dealing with other humans.

570
00:37:08,495 --> 00:37:09,664
I think I'll be okay.

571
00:37:10,497 --> 00:37:11,666
Oh, shit.

572
00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:13,668
My mom called like five times.

573
00:37:14,035 --> 00:37:15,803
She's probably making sure
everything's okay.

574
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,576
Hey, Mom, saw you
called a few times.

575
00:37:21,609 --> 00:37:23,711
- Everything good?
<i>- Everything's fine.</i>

576
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:25,378
<i>Well, it's mostly fine.</i>

577
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,616
<i>It's okay. I just thought</i>
<i>it would be nice</i>

578
00:37:28,649 --> 00:37:30,051
<i>if you were able to come by.</i>

579
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:33,020
<i>-</i> Now?
<i>-Yeah. Come over for lunch.</i>

580
00:37:33,855 --> 00:37:35,288
Are you sure everything's okay?

581
00:37:35,322 --> 00:37:37,290
<i>Yeah. I mean...</i>

582
00:37:37,324 --> 00:37:39,727
<i>your dad is,</i>
<i>well, you can imagine.</i>

583
00:37:40,027 --> 00:37:41,996
-Is he all right?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

584
00:37:42,029 --> 00:37:44,799
<i>He's just dealing</i>
<i>with things in his own way.</i>

585
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,367
<i>But I think it would be nice</i>
<i>if you could come by.</i>

586
00:37:47,735 --> 00:37:50,270
<i>It would mean a lot</i>
<i>to him and to me.</i>

587
00:37:50,538 --> 00:37:51,706
<i>Please?</i>

588
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,842
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um...

589
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,678
I'll just get ready
and I'll head over in a few.

590
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,781
<i>Great! See you in a bit.</i>

591
00:38:11,592 --> 00:38:13,761
Okay, so final warning.

592
00:38:14,394 --> 00:38:16,396
My parents can be weird.

593
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:18,766
We literally had a whole
conversation about this

594
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,636
on the car ride over here,
I consider myself warned.

595
00:38:23,571 --> 00:38:25,640
-There's my dumpling.
-Jesus Christ!

596
00:38:25,673 --> 00:38:28,509
-What?
-Why the hell
aren't you wearing pants?

597
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:32,079
-Why would I?
-What the fuck, Dad?

598
00:38:32,113 --> 00:38:36,483
Gary! Did you answer the
door without clothes on again?

599
00:38:36,918 --> 00:38:38,920
Let me live my life, woman!

600
00:38:39,587 --> 00:38:40,788
Gary!

601
00:38:40,822 --> 00:38:42,690
Nobody wants to see that.

602
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,424
I don't want to see that.

603
00:38:44,759 --> 00:38:46,761
That's why we leave
the lights off.

604
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:48,428
Goddamn it!

605
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:50,932
You know, you married me.

606
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:52,800
Go put some clothes on!

607
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:55,703
Baby, we don't have time
for clothes anymore.

608
00:38:55,736 --> 00:38:57,038
Go, go!

609
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:03,778
-Hey, Mom.
-Hi, sweetie.

610
00:39:03,811 --> 00:39:06,814
Come on in.
Sorry about your father.

611
00:39:06,848 --> 00:39:10,017
You know, he can go a little
overboard with things.

612
00:39:10,818 --> 00:39:13,486
That image will haunt my dreams.

613
00:39:13,855 --> 00:39:15,690
Well, come on down
to the kitchen.

614
00:39:15,723 --> 00:39:16,891
I'm just finishing up.

615
00:39:29,637 --> 00:39:31,505
Oh, some week, huh?

616
00:39:32,106 --> 00:39:35,109
Yeah, I don't think I've heard
anyone be so casual about it,

617
00:39:35,142 --> 00:39:37,678
but I guess you could say.

618
00:39:38,713 --> 00:39:42,083
Actually,
you don't have to pour me one.

619
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:47,688
Oh shoot!
I'm so sorry, I forgot.

620
00:39:47,722 --> 00:39:49,824
You're still not drinking?

621
00:39:50,224 --> 00:39:52,059
Yeah, It's been six months.

622
00:39:52,727 --> 00:39:54,394
Not sure it's done me
any good, but...

623
00:39:55,129 --> 00:39:56,964
Anyway, you were saying,
some week.

624
00:39:56,998 --> 00:39:59,033
Hmm. You know, it is what it is.

625
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:00,935
You know, I go with the flow.

626
00:40:01,202 --> 00:40:04,105
Your father is having
a tougher time of it, though.

627
00:40:04,138 --> 00:40:05,573
Yeah, I didn't notice.

628
00:40:05,873 --> 00:40:07,108
Oh, he'll be fine.

629
00:40:07,742 --> 00:40:09,877
It's probably better
he only had a week.

630
00:40:10,645 --> 00:40:13,614
You don't want him
analyzing things too much.

631
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:21,022
Mmm! Gary, get down here.
Two minutes!

632
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:23,658
I know you worry about him.

633
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:25,893
He worries about you, too.

634
00:40:26,928 --> 00:40:28,696
How are you doing, anyway?

635
00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:30,564
Pretty good, actually.

636
00:40:31,032 --> 00:40:32,533
Uh-huh.

637
00:40:32,934 --> 00:40:36,837
Well, I'm not sure I believe
you, but if you say so.

638
00:40:36,871 --> 00:40:38,471
No, really.

639
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:43,110
Well, good, great.

640
00:40:43,611 --> 00:40:44,912
We'll have
a wonderful meal then.

641
00:40:45,212 --> 00:40:47,048
Nothing to worry about.

642
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:50,885
Gary! Food!

643
00:40:54,522 --> 00:40:57,725
When I talked to you last week,
you were about to go on a date.

644
00:40:58,225 --> 00:40:59,794
How did it go?

645
00:41:00,661 --> 00:41:01,829
Does it matter anymore?

646
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:05,498
Well, no, but...

647
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:08,536
unless you're going to get
married in the next three days.

648
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:09,837
Is he the one?

649
00:41:10,137 --> 00:41:13,040
No, Mom.
He most definitely was not.

650
00:41:13,074 --> 00:41:15,076
Oh, that's too bad.

651
00:41:15,576 --> 00:41:17,111
Did you still have fun?

652
00:41:17,578 --> 00:41:20,648
- Nope.
- Did you...

653
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:22,783
Can we talk about
something else please?

654
00:41:22,817 --> 00:41:25,586
I don't mean to pry, I just--

655
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:26,821
Goddamn it!

656
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:29,190
Will you please
shut the fuck up?

657
00:41:31,792 --> 00:41:34,061
Did we say something wrong?

658
00:41:36,197 --> 00:41:38,265
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

659
00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:41,535
It's just my Guide.
He has been yelling all morning.

660
00:41:42,169 --> 00:41:44,772
And I finally got fed up
so I just, sorry.

661
00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:46,140
Please, go on.

662
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,642
Why was he yelling?

663
00:41:48,676 --> 00:41:50,144
I locked him in the basement.

664
00:41:52,113 --> 00:41:53,981
You locked him in the basement?

665
00:41:54,015 --> 00:41:57,585
Yeah, I got tired of him
talking all the fucking time.

666
00:41:57,618 --> 00:42:00,888
You know, you can send them away
when you make your decision,
right?

667
00:42:01,756 --> 00:42:04,325
Yeah, and that's what they say.

668
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:06,894
But I don't want them
to know what I'm thinking.

669
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:09,730
I have to keep them
on their toes.

670
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:14,602
So you locked him
in the basement?

671
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:18,305
Seemed a little more
humane than the shed.

672
00:42:18,339 --> 00:42:22,643
Well, mine's very nice
and very handsome, too.

673
00:42:22,676 --> 00:42:26,147
I think your father is jealous.

674
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,982
I don't know why we need them
in the first place.

675
00:42:28,015 --> 00:42:30,284
I mean, the decision
is pretty obvious.

676
00:42:30,317 --> 00:42:33,687
I mean, who wants to turn down
permanent pleasure
for more of this shithole?

677
00:42:39,126 --> 00:42:43,931
Well, actually, I was
thinking about staying.

678
00:42:50,905 --> 00:42:55,076
Oh really?
That was a good one, honey.

679
00:43:03,751 --> 00:43:05,186
I love you.

680
00:43:06,754 --> 00:43:08,389
But I mean, you really couldn't
get your shit together
before all this went down.

681
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:12,126
How do you think you're going
to do it without somebody
taking care of you, huh?

682
00:43:20,801 --> 00:43:22,069
Wha--?

683
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:27,708
What the fuck was that Gary?

684
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:32,413
We don't have time
for anything other than honesty.

685
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:33,914
That's your daughter!

686
00:43:33,948 --> 00:43:35,116
Go apologize.

687
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:37,017
I stand behind what I--

688
00:43:37,051 --> 00:43:38,119
-Now!
-Right.

689
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:03,410
Couldn't they have
ended the world
when it was a little cooler out?

690
00:44:05,412 --> 00:44:07,081
Probably didn't factor
the weather in.

691
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:08,916
Right.

692
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:12,987
Sorry.

693
00:44:13,287 --> 00:44:15,189
-I didn't mean to be...
-No, that's fine.

694
00:44:16,056 --> 00:44:17,758
I get it. I do.

695
00:44:18,425 --> 00:44:19,894
You don't have to say anything.

696
00:44:21,729 --> 00:44:23,264
We all have to do
what's best for ourselves,

697
00:44:23,297 --> 00:44:26,133
and we don't have
to agree on what that is.

698
00:44:28,502 --> 00:44:30,171
I know I can be
a little critical.

699
00:44:31,573 --> 00:44:33,440
But you know
that's just because I want
what's best for you, right?

700
00:44:36,043 --> 00:44:37,344
I know.

701
00:44:40,247 --> 00:44:41,982
Are you sure you want to stay?

702
00:44:44,418 --> 00:44:45,886
Yeah.

703
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:47,955
It's weird.

704
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:52,259
I feel like I'm
the only person on the planet
that feels more normal

705
00:44:52,293 --> 00:44:54,328
now that I know
that we weren't in control.

706
00:44:56,997 --> 00:45:01,902
Once everyone else
is out of here, I can start
living my life my way,

707
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:07,741
without weird future people
dictating everything I do.

708
00:45:09,276 --> 00:45:11,278
Do you really think
we had no control?

709
00:45:13,047 --> 00:45:18,419
I can't imagine they put that
much effort into making billions
of these simulation things

710
00:45:19,086 --> 00:45:21,422
just to let us run amok.

711
00:45:22,923 --> 00:45:25,059
Did you ever ask your Guide
why they're ending it?

712
00:45:26,994 --> 00:45:28,229
No.

713
00:45:28,829 --> 00:45:29,930
You should.

714
00:45:31,799 --> 00:45:33,100
Why, do you know?

715
00:45:34,001 --> 00:45:35,336
I don't.

716
00:45:36,804 --> 00:45:38,405
Honestly, I really don't care.

717
00:45:40,441 --> 00:45:43,777
But I think you should know
if you're going to stay
based on that.

718
00:45:46,313 --> 00:45:49,783
It just sounds like
they got what they needed,
and it's time to wrap it up.

719
00:45:50,217 --> 00:45:51,385
But what were they looking for?

720
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:54,288
Again, I don't care.

721
00:45:55,456 --> 00:45:58,025
I think it's a great way to go
and I'm ready to take it.

722
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,428
But if I were you,

723
00:46:02,863 --> 00:46:05,399
I wouldn't
want to make the decision
without knowing all the facts.

724
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:09,336
I mean, for all we know,
this world is defective,

725
00:46:10,971 --> 00:46:12,574
and you'll be stuck here
all on your own

726
00:46:12,607 --> 00:46:13,974
while it falls apart.

727
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:17,144
I'm just being honest.

728
00:46:22,383 --> 00:46:23,984
Would they really end this

729
00:46:24,552 --> 00:46:26,153
if it was good enough to keep?

730
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:36,964
I'm gonna go back inside.

731
00:46:38,365 --> 00:46:41,302
You come in
whenever you're ready.

732
00:46:43,003 --> 00:46:45,105
I know your mom would like
to spend more time with you.

733
00:47:07,428 --> 00:47:09,997
We're so happy
you came over, sweetie.

734
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:12,399
Yeah, I'm glad I came too.

735
00:47:12,433 --> 00:47:15,637
I didn't think this is how
we'd be saying goodbye.

736
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:18,138
Well, I'll come back.

737
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:19,873
We still have a few more days.

738
00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:26,880
-Actually, we're gonna...
-Remember how we were supposed
to go to Fiji for our 30th?

739
00:47:26,914 --> 00:47:28,916
We decided we should still go.

740
00:47:30,451 --> 00:47:33,387
Why not spend what little time
we have left in paradise?

741
00:47:35,623 --> 00:47:37,124
Wow.

742
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:39,927
I completely forgot about that.

743
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,629
- I guess I just assumed...
- I know.

744
00:47:41,663 --> 00:47:44,365
I was surprised
people were flying as well.

745
00:47:44,398 --> 00:47:46,433
I guess the pilots
had the same idea as us.

746
00:47:46,467 --> 00:47:50,170
And it's not like
getting a refund
is any help at this point.

747
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:57,311
Well, wow, that sounds...

748
00:47:58,946 --> 00:48:01,248
nice, that sounds really nice.

749
00:48:01,281 --> 00:48:02,584
I'm happy for you guys.

750
00:48:03,951 --> 00:48:05,386
Thanks, sweetie.

751
00:48:08,422 --> 00:48:11,992
So... this is it.

752
00:48:13,728 --> 00:48:16,130
Yeah, I guess it is.

753
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:20,668
Okay. Well, I love you guys.

754
00:48:23,538 --> 00:48:27,107
I wish you could stay,
but I want you
to live your lives.

755
00:48:28,275 --> 00:48:29,577
We love you, too.

756
00:48:31,412 --> 00:48:34,948
And we are so proud of you
for always being yourself.

757
00:48:35,717 --> 00:48:38,385
Hey, good luck.

758
00:48:39,353 --> 00:48:41,455
I know you'll make
the right choice for you.

759
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:51,198
Oh Dad, can you do me a favor?

760
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:53,400
Of course.

761
00:48:55,068 --> 00:48:56,571
Wear pants on the plane.

762
00:48:57,204 --> 00:48:58,673
You know, for Mom?

763
00:48:59,373 --> 00:49:02,142
Will do.

764
00:49:02,443 --> 00:49:04,244
Okay.

765
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:18,125
Oh, it's okay.

766
00:49:30,672 --> 00:49:33,006
You're right, they're
pretty interesting people.

767
00:49:33,608 --> 00:49:36,310
-I guess that I could have--
-Why is our simulation ending?

768
00:49:37,444 --> 00:49:38,979
It has served its purpose.

769
00:49:39,413 --> 00:49:41,749
We are reallocating resources
to other simulations.

770
00:49:42,684 --> 00:49:46,487
Okay, then what was its purpose?

771
00:49:46,521 --> 00:49:51,559
Every simulation is designed
to test a specific variable's
impact on the world.

772
00:49:51,793 --> 00:49:53,661
Sometimes the sky
is a different color.

773
00:49:54,061 --> 00:49:55,697
Sometimes snow is warm.

774
00:49:56,296 --> 00:49:57,532
Some are permanent.

775
00:49:57,565 --> 00:49:59,433
Others are temporary.

776
00:50:00,802 --> 00:50:02,236
What was our variable?

777
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,639
The great auk.

778
00:50:06,073 --> 00:50:07,407
What the shit is that?

779
00:50:08,408 --> 00:50:10,010
A flightless bird.

780
00:50:11,445 --> 00:50:12,479
What?

781
00:50:13,681 --> 00:50:15,349
A penguin.

782
00:50:17,351 --> 00:50:19,353
-A penguin?
-Yes.

783
00:50:22,322 --> 00:50:23,658
A fucking penguin.

784
00:50:23,691 --> 00:50:26,460
Not a singular penguin.
A species of penguins.

785
00:50:28,763 --> 00:50:32,165
All righty then,
where are these penguins?

786
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:35,469
They lived
in the North Atlantic,
but they're all gone now.

787
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:38,205
Hunted to extinction
in the middle 19th century.

788
00:50:39,106 --> 00:50:41,108
Then why is this
just ending now?

789
00:50:42,844 --> 00:50:47,815
We want to see a variable's
impact on the world, but also
the impact of its absence.

790
00:50:49,817 --> 00:50:52,820
Great. Fucking penguins
ended the world.

791
00:50:54,589 --> 00:50:58,660
More accurately,
the presence of the penguins
was the reason for the world.

792
00:50:59,493 --> 00:51:02,262
Absence of them is the reason
for the end of the world.

793
00:51:05,499 --> 00:51:07,167
It was us.

794
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,836
Come again?

795
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:12,139
It was us all along.

796
00:51:13,173 --> 00:51:14,341
It was our fault.

797
00:51:15,275 --> 00:51:16,410
We were in control.

798
00:51:17,311 --> 00:51:18,780
We destroyed the variable.

799
00:51:19,514 --> 00:51:21,081
We ended the world.

800
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:26,386
In a manner of speaking, yes.
We're really ending it for you.

801
00:51:26,688 --> 00:51:28,488
Although you did
give us reason to.

802
00:51:28,856 --> 00:51:30,892
That said,
we are also responsible

803
00:51:30,925 --> 00:51:33,126
for the creation of the world
in the first place.

804
00:51:33,795 --> 00:51:37,331
We're also essentially
you of the future,
except not in a simulation.

805
00:51:37,899 --> 00:51:39,499
It's all very complicated.

806
00:51:39,534 --> 00:51:42,336
It's all just as fucking
pointless as before.

807
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:45,272
-Yes, but--
-Get out.

808
00:51:46,206 --> 00:51:47,508
What?

809
00:51:47,709 --> 00:51:50,377
Get out of the car.

810
00:51:50,878 --> 00:51:52,547
I don't want to see you anymore.

811
00:51:54,649 --> 00:51:57,250
I've made up my mind.
I can't stay in this world.

812
00:52:00,521 --> 00:52:01,823
- But--
Get out!

813
00:52:03,625 --> 00:52:04,859
All right.

814
00:52:13,701 --> 00:52:15,335
I'll still be
keeping an eye on you.

815
00:52:16,336 --> 00:52:18,138
If you change your mind,
I'll know.

816
00:52:19,641 --> 00:52:21,375
Good luck, Sarah.

817
00:52:52,874 --> 00:52:58,680
Fuck!

818
00:53:13,761 --> 00:53:15,195
Hi.

819
00:53:16,463 --> 00:53:17,632
You okay?

820
00:53:20,935 --> 00:53:23,905
Yeah. Yeah, totally fine.

821
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:27,775
Okay, good, good. If you say so.

822
00:53:28,576 --> 00:53:30,778
I guess we're all
totally fine right now.

823
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:37,250
Sorry, you just
caught me off guard.

824
00:53:37,284 --> 00:53:40,955
I didn't think anyone
would see me like this.

825
00:53:40,988 --> 00:53:41,989
Oh, it's fine.

826
00:53:42,857 --> 00:53:44,424
I'll let you get back to it.

827
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:46,527
I just wanted
to give you one of these.

828
00:53:49,764 --> 00:53:51,431
An end of the world party?

829
00:53:53,034 --> 00:53:55,402
Everybody's going at once,
so why don't we have some fun
and all go together?

830
00:53:57,004 --> 00:53:58,271
A little weird.

831
00:53:59,006 --> 00:54:02,844
Yeah, well isn't all this
a little weird
in like a cosmic sense?

832
00:54:05,847 --> 00:54:06,981
Okay, you win.

833
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,850
Right on.

834
00:54:10,017 --> 00:54:13,453
Starts at eight on Friday,
obviously ends at midnight.

835
00:54:16,389 --> 00:54:19,694
All right. Well, I gotta finish
passing these out.

836
00:54:19,727 --> 00:54:21,361
I'll see you then.

837
00:55:48,516 --> 00:55:52,687
Hey, Mom, just checking in.

838
00:55:55,957 --> 00:55:58,793
You guys are probably
already on the plane, um...

839
00:56:00,427 --> 00:56:02,630
And I don't even know
if you're going to have
service down there.

840
00:56:02,864 --> 00:56:05,566
But I figured I'd try anyway.

841
00:56:11,672 --> 00:56:12,840
I...

842
00:56:15,576 --> 00:56:16,844
uh...

843
00:56:18,846 --> 00:56:21,015
kind of wish I had
gone with you guys.

844
00:56:24,018 --> 00:56:25,553
I probably would have said no
if you'd asked.

845
00:56:25,586 --> 00:56:27,021
So I understand why you didn't.

846
00:56:32,593 --> 00:56:33,895
I just, um...

847
00:56:37,031 --> 00:56:38,866
I don't really know
what to do with myself now.

848
00:56:39,567 --> 00:56:40,735
You know?

849
00:56:45,806 --> 00:56:46,841
Yeah, you're probably
not even going to get this.

850
00:56:46,874 --> 00:56:52,546
But If you do... I miss you.

851
00:56:56,617 --> 00:56:57,985
Say hi to Dad for me.

852
00:57:02,023 --> 00:57:03,456
I love you guys.

853
00:58:36,717 --> 00:58:39,887
Barry? You all right?

854
00:58:41,188 --> 00:58:42,857
Yeah, I'm great.

855
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:44,925
Just taking in the sky
one last time.

856
00:58:45,826 --> 00:58:47,061
This is it, you know?

857
00:58:48,729 --> 00:58:50,598
Yeah, I guess it is.

858
00:58:51,165 --> 00:58:54,068
Well, at least now we all know
there wasn't a point.

859
00:58:55,836 --> 00:58:57,004
Of what?

860
00:58:57,038 --> 00:58:59,173
Everything. Life.

861
00:58:59,206 --> 00:59:01,142
Is this even life?

862
00:59:01,842 --> 00:59:05,546
I don't think I have the
qualifications to answer that.

863
00:59:07,715 --> 00:59:09,750
You know, back
when I worked on Wall Street

864
00:59:09,784 --> 00:59:11,652
I thought I had
everything figured out.

865
00:59:12,286 --> 00:59:14,989
I was happy because
I thought I was a success.

866
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:22,029
But that was based
on whatever I thought
the world was.

867
00:59:22,063 --> 00:59:23,864
And then that changed.

868
00:59:24,265 --> 00:59:27,835
I changed, and it changed again.

869
00:59:29,336 --> 00:59:32,039
What we think, we become.

870
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,075
What?

871
00:59:34,108 --> 00:59:36,343
-Buddha.
-Right.

872
00:59:37,812 --> 00:59:40,047
Um, well...

873
00:59:41,749 --> 00:59:43,951
maybe what's happening now
is the point.

874
00:59:45,152 --> 00:59:47,788
Maybe it is about
where we go next.

875
00:59:47,822 --> 00:59:49,190
Does it even matter where we go?

876
00:59:49,223 --> 00:59:51,325
I mean, we're here
and then we aren't.

877
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,996
We can't get to wherever
is next on our own, you know,

878
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:59,100
so no matter what,
we gotta go along
for the ride, man.

879
00:59:59,133 --> 01:00:00,668
And then you know what?

880
01:00:01,702 --> 01:00:04,672
We all wind up
in the same place anyway.

881
01:00:06,707 --> 01:00:09,110
I always thought it would be
the aliens that took me away,

882
01:00:09,977 --> 01:00:11,745
but I guess this
will have to do.

883
01:00:13,347 --> 01:00:14,882
Oh.

884
01:00:16,851 --> 01:00:18,285
See you at the party tonight?

885
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:21,689
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

886
01:00:22,156 --> 01:00:23,791
Far out.

887
01:00:24,792 --> 01:00:27,161
Far. Out.

888
01:00:29,897 --> 01:00:31,665
Hey Kay.

889
01:00:33,467 --> 01:00:36,737
Um, give me a call back
when you can.

890
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:42,376
I know that you're into
whatever you're into now,

891
01:00:45,346 --> 01:00:48,415
but I wanted to see if maybe
you wanted to hang out tonight.

892
01:00:52,786 --> 01:00:57,057
I, I'm not doing too well.

893
01:00:57,091 --> 01:01:01,028
I'm actually, I'm pretty lonely.

894
01:01:03,497 --> 01:01:05,933
I'm even thinking about
going to a party tonight.

895
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:09,670
Figured you'd come over
just to see that happen.

896
01:01:11,138 --> 01:01:12,840
I really don't want to go alone.

897
01:01:16,277 --> 01:01:19,980
So... give me a call.

898
01:02:27,248 --> 01:02:31,051
Hey! Ooh, look at you.

899
01:02:31,085 --> 01:02:33,287
Oh, goddamn it. You again.

900
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,455
What are you doing here, babe?

901
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:39,326
Don't... Ugh, I don't know.

902
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,295
I'm just here.
What are you doing here?

903
01:02:41,328 --> 01:02:44,064
You know, sniffing around
for some ladies.

904
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:47,569
Figured the end of the world
would leave them
wanting to get pretty weird.

905
01:02:47,602 --> 01:02:50,004
-Of course.
-How about you, babe?

906
01:02:50,605 --> 01:02:52,840
Do you not remember
how our date ended?

907
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,044
Hmm, I do,
but I'm very persistent.

908
01:02:58,245 --> 01:03:00,247
You miss 100 percent
of the shots you don't take.

909
01:03:00,281 --> 01:03:02,483
-Thought I was a six.
-You are.

910
01:03:02,517 --> 01:03:04,852
But ooh,
you are looking good tonight.

911
01:03:04,885 --> 01:03:07,154
I just might make you
an honorary seven
for the end of the world.

912
01:03:07,187 --> 01:03:09,591
-Jesus, you're a shithead.
-Come on.

913
01:03:09,624 --> 01:03:12,594
It's not like
you're gonna do any better
with the time you got left.

914
01:03:12,627 --> 01:03:14,461
What did I do to deserve this?

915
01:03:14,495 --> 01:03:17,131
-What do you got to lose?
-Fuck off!

916
01:03:18,866 --> 01:03:23,037
All right, well,
you know where to find me
when you change your mind.

917
01:03:23,337 --> 01:03:28,008
Huh? Huh? Okay.

918
01:03:33,515 --> 01:03:36,016
Hey Kay, I'm really glad
you're here.

919
01:03:40,421 --> 01:03:41,889
Hello?

920
01:03:44,992 --> 01:03:46,561
Is anyone home?

921
01:03:50,898 --> 01:03:52,199
Are you on something?

922
01:03:57,404 --> 01:03:59,273
Shit.

923
01:04:26,568 --> 01:04:29,503
Hey everybody!
Less than a minute!

924
01:04:30,437 --> 01:04:31,972
Less than a minute!

925
01:05:20,722 --> 01:05:23,157
It's hard to see
how lost you are,

926
01:05:24,024 --> 01:05:25,325
till you find
your way back again.

927
01:05:26,493 --> 01:05:29,129
I spent so many years
fighting who I was,

928
01:05:30,164 --> 01:05:33,701
then a bunch more trying
to deal with the lack of
identity that came from that.

929
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:39,139
I tried so hard to be someone
that people liked

930
01:05:39,173 --> 01:05:41,208
that I stopped being
anybody at all.

931
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:47,549
It's been a long road, but...

932
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:52,019
but I finally feel
like myself again.

933
01:05:55,189 --> 01:05:56,691
I almost forgot
what that felt like.

934
01:05:58,693 --> 01:06:02,095
It was euphoric, you know?

935
01:06:03,330 --> 01:06:05,065
I actually
thought something was wrong.

936
01:06:06,066 --> 01:06:07,468
But then I realized that...

937
01:06:08,469 --> 01:06:11,205
this must be what it feels like

938
01:06:11,573 --> 01:06:15,976
to not be buried
by anxiety and depression
24 hours a day.

939
01:06:17,712 --> 01:06:20,247
The lows are actually
offset by highs,

940
01:06:21,482 --> 01:06:24,686
instead of lows
and slightly better lows.

941
01:06:30,491 --> 01:06:31,726
I know I gave you a hard time.

942
01:06:34,428 --> 01:06:35,597
But you're right.

943
01:06:36,497 --> 01:06:37,665
It is a process.

944
01:06:41,468 --> 01:06:44,404
And I'm glad I stuck with it
because I'm finally
putting the work in

945
01:06:44,438 --> 01:06:47,542
and I'm really starting
to see the results.

946
01:06:51,746 --> 01:06:53,313
Same time next week?

947
01:08:54,736 --> 01:08:56,604
-Hey!
-Fuck!

948
01:08:56,638 --> 01:08:58,806
Holy shit! It's you.

949
01:09:00,307 --> 01:09:01,542
Fuck...

950
01:09:01,576 --> 01:09:03,645
Do you remember me? It's Tucker.

951
01:09:04,512 --> 01:09:06,480
Unfortunately, I do.

952
01:09:06,514 --> 01:09:09,383
-What the hell
are you doing here?
-Awesome! This is so rad!

953
01:09:10,518 --> 01:09:12,854
I haven't seen anyone
in two years.

954
01:09:12,887 --> 01:09:14,956
Well, I figured you would have
gone out with everyone else.

955
01:09:14,989 --> 01:09:17,257
I mean, the last I saw you was
at the end of the world party.

956
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:19,527
No, it wasn't really my thing.

957
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:23,463
I'm kind of all about
living in the present
and not repeating the past.

958
01:09:24,632 --> 01:09:26,400
That's a surprisingly
good answer.

959
01:09:27,869 --> 01:09:29,369
I kind of regret it, though.
There's not really
any chicks here, so...

960
01:09:29,403 --> 01:09:31,606
-There it is.
-I'm kidding.

961
01:09:31,973 --> 01:09:33,675
I'm kind of surprised
you didn't go.

962
01:09:33,708 --> 01:09:35,610
And you can go right back
to thinking I didn't.

963
01:09:35,643 --> 01:09:37,578
Wait, wait.
We should stick together
or something, you know?

964
01:09:37,612 --> 01:09:39,914
I can't imagine
you wanna be alone.

965
01:09:40,848 --> 01:09:42,650
-I'm good.
-You sure?

966
01:09:43,283 --> 01:09:45,687
I mean, it's just the two of us.

967
01:09:46,821 --> 01:09:48,823
I know I've been lonely.

968
01:09:48,856 --> 01:09:51,324
I was actually doing
really well here
before you showed up.

969
01:09:52,527 --> 01:09:53,928
Where have you been, anyway?

970
01:09:55,262 --> 01:09:58,933
I brought a couple of chicks
back to my apartment
in the city,

971
01:09:58,966 --> 01:10:00,568
and then I just stayed.

972
01:10:02,269 --> 01:10:03,905
The city's not really fun though
without all of the people.

973
01:10:03,938 --> 01:10:07,709
And I got tired
of walking up the stairs.

974
01:10:07,742 --> 01:10:09,409
So I came out here.

975
01:10:09,443 --> 01:10:10,945
I'm not really sure
what I was trying to find.

976
01:10:10,978 --> 01:10:12,580
Well, it's really not
that much better up here.

977
01:10:12,613 --> 01:10:14,916
So maybe
you should just go back.

978
01:10:14,949 --> 01:10:17,919
We're here now, we should
probably make the most of it.

979
01:10:17,952 --> 01:10:19,754
-Gotta go.
-Hey, hey.

980
01:10:19,787 --> 01:10:21,321
I just can't
believe I ran into you.

981
01:10:21,354 --> 01:10:24,324
You know,
we should hang out tomorrow.

982
01:10:25,325 --> 01:10:27,829
I can't hear you. Bye.

983
01:10:27,862 --> 01:10:29,664
I'll come and find you
in the morning.

984
01:10:36,003 --> 01:10:37,404
Huh.

985
01:11:31,626 --> 01:11:33,594
Good morning!

986
01:11:34,529 --> 01:11:36,363
What are you doing here?

987
01:11:36,396 --> 01:11:37,732
I told you
I'd come find you today.

988
01:11:38,465 --> 01:11:40,968
Look, I got a pair of wheels
so I can keep up with you.

989
01:11:41,969 --> 01:11:43,538
Seriously?

990
01:11:43,571 --> 01:11:45,640
Yeah, let's go.

991
01:11:45,673 --> 01:11:48,475
You really can't take
a hint, can you?

992
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:50,845
What do I have to lose, right?

993
01:12:07,494 --> 01:12:08,930
Hey!

994
01:12:10,565 --> 01:12:12,066
Where are you going?

995
01:12:22,777 --> 01:12:24,344
Help!

996
01:12:36,624 --> 01:12:38,059
Looks like nice, clean water.

997
01:12:40,795 --> 01:12:43,564
The river water I was drinking
in the city was fucking gross.

998
01:12:43,764 --> 01:12:45,099
Blech.

999
01:12:48,769 --> 01:12:52,573
You know, I didn't
expect to find anyone
when I came back here.

1000
01:12:53,541 --> 01:12:56,544
Yeah, if only that
had actually discouraged you.

1001
01:12:57,078 --> 01:12:59,180
Honestly, I was just
really excited to see you.

1002
01:12:59,213 --> 01:13:01,716
So sorry
if I came on a little strong.

1003
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:07,755
It's been lonely, you know?

1004
01:13:07,788 --> 01:13:09,489
I'm an extrovert.

1005
01:13:09,523 --> 01:13:11,559
So this whole thing
has been pretty hard on me.

1006
01:13:13,493 --> 01:13:14,762
Maybe I should've went
with everyone else.

1007
01:13:15,229 --> 01:13:16,797
I wish you did.

1008
01:13:16,831 --> 01:13:19,066
Wow, that's a pretty
shitty thing to say.

1009
01:13:19,567 --> 01:13:23,771
Yeah, well, consider it fair
payback for being such
an asshole to me before.

1010
01:13:23,804 --> 01:13:27,008
You're seriously not over that?

1011
01:13:27,208 --> 01:13:31,112
Come on, I have had
some time to realize
I was a little bit of a dick,

1012
01:13:31,145 --> 01:13:33,547
but you're not even capable

1013
01:13:33,581 --> 01:13:35,683
of forgiving the one person
left in the world to forgive?

1014
01:13:35,716 --> 01:13:37,885
No. I'm not.

1015
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:41,555
It's like I said when we met.

1016
01:13:41,589 --> 01:13:45,126
You're the embodiment
of everything that was
wrong with our world.

1017
01:13:46,027 --> 01:13:49,897
I can't even look at you
without being reminded
of how miserable I used to be.

1018
01:13:50,598 --> 01:13:53,701
I forgave myself
for not living my life.

1019
01:13:53,734 --> 01:13:55,903
That was hard enough.
I don't need you here

1020
01:13:55,937 --> 01:13:58,673
to remind me of the world
that made me that way
in the first place.

1021
01:13:59,974 --> 01:14:01,676
Look, I'm glad you feel
better about yourself.

1022
01:14:01,709 --> 01:14:03,511
I really am.

1023
01:14:04,045 --> 01:14:06,446
But if you've grown up,
how do you know
I haven't too?

1024
01:14:07,682 --> 01:14:09,083
Because you don't want to.

1025
01:14:09,917 --> 01:14:12,219
You're too in love with yourself
to care about changing.

1026
01:14:12,987 --> 01:14:15,623
Maybe you're not as good
at reading people
as you think you are.

1027
01:14:15,656 --> 01:14:17,457
That's hilarious
coming from you.

1028
01:14:17,858 --> 01:14:19,126
I'm not done, okay?

1029
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:20,861
I'm aware I was an asshole.

1030
01:14:21,162 --> 01:14:22,997
I know what I did.
I remember what I said.

1031
01:14:23,297 --> 01:14:26,233
I mean that whole persona
that you hated so much,

1032
01:14:26,267 --> 01:14:30,972
just a character
I created to mask
a giant stack of insecurities.

1033
01:14:31,005 --> 01:14:32,673
I wanted people to like me.

1034
01:14:32,707 --> 01:14:34,642
So I figured the best way
to get them to think

1035
01:14:34,675 --> 01:14:37,979
I was cool and confident
was to treat them like shit.

1036
01:14:39,046 --> 01:14:42,049
And you know what's funny
is it actually worked.

1037
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:44,018
So I kept doing it.

1038
01:14:46,787 --> 01:14:51,258
I've had a lot of time to think
and I can finally admit
how toxic it all was.

1039
01:14:52,626 --> 01:14:56,831
Meanwhile, you're just as
judgmental and selfish
as you were before.

1040
01:14:57,631 --> 01:14:59,200
I get you might not
want me here,

1041
01:14:59,233 --> 01:15:01,235
but maybe you should get
off your high horse of bitchery

1042
01:15:01,268 --> 01:15:02,737
and look in the fucking mirror.

1043
01:15:06,941 --> 01:15:09,076
Shit, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

1044
01:15:10,011 --> 01:15:13,214
Sarah! Sarah, come back.

1045
01:15:33,134 --> 01:15:34,301
Excellent.

1046
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:57,558
Sarah!

1047
01:16:04,231 --> 01:16:08,169
Sarah, I'm really sorry.

1048
01:16:10,171 --> 01:16:12,673
-Let me carry one of those.
-Just leave me alone.

1049
01:16:12,706 --> 01:16:14,942
I swear, I can be useful
if you just let me.

1050
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:16,677
No!
I have everything under control.

1051
01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:18,312
I was doing just fine on my own.

1052
01:16:18,345 --> 01:16:21,348
Please, there's got to be
something I can do.

1053
01:16:21,982 --> 01:16:23,818
-I'm fine.
-Just let me help you.

1054
01:16:23,851 --> 01:16:25,953
-Let me give you a hand!
-You don't listen to me!

1055
01:19:36,377 --> 01:19:38,979
-Hello.
-Hi.

1056
01:19:40,114 --> 01:19:42,883
I'm just here to sell you
some solar panels.

1057
01:19:59,133 --> 01:20:00,301
I've had my eye on you.

1058
01:20:01,902 --> 01:20:03,170
Really?

1059
01:20:04,506 --> 01:20:07,107
There aren't that many
of you left, so we like to

1060
01:20:07,374 --> 01:20:08,809
check in from time to time.

1061
01:20:10,545 --> 01:20:11,879
How many?

1062
01:20:12,379 --> 01:20:16,917
246,922 worldwide.

1063
01:20:17,619 --> 01:20:20,054
Bet that sounds like
more than it is.

1064
01:20:20,988 --> 01:20:21,955
Yes, it does.

1065
01:20:24,158 --> 01:20:26,393
It seems you've had it rough
the last few days.

1066
01:20:28,162 --> 01:20:29,229
Yeah.

1067
01:20:29,664 --> 01:20:31,265
Are you okay?

1068
01:20:33,167 --> 01:20:34,868
I think it's pretty clear
that I'm not.

1069
01:20:35,502 --> 01:20:37,104
I know.

1070
01:20:38,405 --> 01:20:40,341
Who would have thought
I'd care about that creep?

1071
01:20:42,009 --> 01:20:45,613
People, real ones
and simulated ones alike,

1072
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:49,316
are programmed to care
about each other.

1073
01:20:51,519 --> 01:20:55,289
You just forgot that
because society had trained you
to think otherwise.

1074
01:20:56,123 --> 01:21:00,194
In plain terms,
people need people.

1075
01:21:02,029 --> 01:21:03,297
I don't know.

1076
01:21:05,533 --> 01:21:07,602
Before, everyone just left.

1077
01:21:08,570 --> 01:21:10,237
Poof.

1078
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:15,476
I was here by myself
and everything was great.

1079
01:21:18,646 --> 01:21:20,981
That douchebag,
I fucking hated him.

1080
01:21:21,014 --> 01:21:22,182
But...

1081
01:21:24,586 --> 01:21:26,086
seeing him...

1082
01:21:28,255 --> 01:21:31,425
dead, there on the ground...

1083
01:21:34,529 --> 01:21:36,163
it all became real.

1084
01:21:39,166 --> 01:21:42,035
After two years of feeling
more alive than I've ever felt,

1085
01:21:42,069 --> 01:21:44,238
reality came crashing in

1086
01:21:44,271 --> 01:21:47,642
and suddenly I was more alone
than I ever thought possible.

1087
01:21:51,345 --> 01:21:54,214
Before I was able
to live like
this whole world was mine.

1088
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:59,286
But now I can't go anywhere
without being reminded
of what we used to be.

1089
01:22:02,089 --> 01:22:06,059
if it makes you feel any better,
he is with everybody else now.

1090
01:22:07,027 --> 01:22:10,030
Really?

1091
01:22:11,498 --> 01:22:14,301
Everyone goes
to the same place in the end.

1092
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:27,615
Do you want to stay here?

1093
01:22:31,753 --> 01:22:35,322
I made my choice,
and it's my responsibility
to live with it.

1094
01:22:38,058 --> 01:22:42,496
If you like, I can send you
to where everyone else is.

1095
01:22:46,433 --> 01:22:47,602
You can do that?

1096
01:22:51,038 --> 01:22:53,575
Everyone who stays
will eventually choose to go.

1097
01:22:53,608 --> 01:22:58,011
We just have to let them come to
that decision in their own time.

1098
01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:05,553
I don't think I can
do this anymore.

1099
01:23:05,587 --> 01:23:06,754
It's okay.

1100
01:23:07,922 --> 01:23:10,123
Why did I think I could
make it on my own?

1101
01:23:12,292 --> 01:23:13,595
You did.

1102
01:23:14,829 --> 01:23:17,464
You were on your own
for two years.

1103
01:23:19,701 --> 01:23:22,169
But that's a lot
for any one person.

1104
01:23:24,672 --> 01:23:26,039
You know, it's funny.

1105
01:23:27,742 --> 01:23:31,746
People would say that suicide
was the easy way out.

1106
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:36,751
It pissed me off hearing that
because most people have no idea

1107
01:23:36,784 --> 01:23:38,786
the kind of pain it takes
to get to that point.

1108
01:23:40,555 --> 01:23:43,658
But I am just now realizing

1109
01:23:43,691 --> 01:23:49,597
that I judged everyone that left
for taking the easy way out.

1110
01:23:52,534 --> 01:23:54,067
But I couldn't do it.

1111
01:23:58,573 --> 01:24:01,141
I guess easy is all relative.

1112
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:04,746
Everyone's struggle
is different.

1113
01:24:06,413 --> 01:24:07,682
I know.

1114
01:24:09,517 --> 01:24:11,285
So what do you think?

1115
01:24:12,687 --> 01:24:14,622
I think...

1116
01:24:17,391 --> 01:24:18,560
I'm ready.

1117
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:21,696
I understand.

1118
01:24:23,631 --> 01:24:26,634
But can I just have
the rest of the day here

1119
01:24:27,467 --> 01:24:31,271
for myself,
just to take it all in?

1120
01:24:32,272 --> 01:24:33,675
Of course.

1121
01:24:35,275 --> 01:24:36,844
I'll come by tomorrow morning.

1122
01:24:37,612 --> 01:24:39,246
Thanks.

1123
01:24:41,281 --> 01:24:42,850
And I'm sorry.

1124
01:24:44,351 --> 01:24:47,421
You were only there to help me
and I shouldn't
have treated you that way.

1125
01:24:49,323 --> 01:24:50,758
Don't worry about it.

1126
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:54,529
At least you didn't
lock me in the basement.

1127
01:25:05,607 --> 01:25:08,676
Do you remember
when you asked me if I had met
another version of you?

1128
01:25:08,710 --> 01:25:10,545
Yeah, you wouldn't tell me.

1129
01:25:11,579 --> 01:25:14,414
I know. I couldn't then.

1130
01:25:15,617 --> 01:25:17,150
So?

1131
01:25:17,652 --> 01:25:21,856
I have met roughly 321,000
versions of you.

1132
01:25:23,725 --> 01:25:25,158
They're all a little
bit different,

1133
01:25:25,192 --> 01:25:27,562
but they are all you.

1134
01:25:29,262 --> 01:25:35,168
I couldn't tell you before
because not all of them
choose to stay.

1135
01:25:36,236 --> 01:25:38,338
And I didn't want to let that
influence your decision.

1136
01:25:40,575 --> 01:25:43,343
In fact, a lot of them

1137
01:25:43,711 --> 01:25:46,246
are a little bit quicker
with the pills than you were,

1138
01:25:47,381 --> 01:25:49,751
and they never get to hear
the truth in the first place.

1139
01:25:51,686 --> 01:25:55,489
Those that do stay
tend to not last very long.

1140
01:25:58,593 --> 01:26:01,663
Of all the Sarahs,
you've made it the farthest.

1141
01:26:04,297 --> 01:26:09,537
You are the strongest and most
true version of yourself.

1142
01:26:13,306 --> 01:26:16,778
No matter what you think
or how you feel right now...

1143
01:26:20,447 --> 01:26:21,949
you've done great.

1144
01:26:41,334 --> 01:26:42,704
I'll see you tomorrow.
