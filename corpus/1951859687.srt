1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,070
- Hello?
- Hello.

2
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,236
- Yes?
- Who is this?

3
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,920
- Who're you trying to reach?
- What number is this?

4
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,759
- Well, what number are
you trying to reach?
- I don't know.

5
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,075
- Well, I think you have
the wrong number.
- Do l?

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,634
It happens. Take it easy.

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,996
- Hello.
- I'm sorry. I guess I dialled
the wrong number.

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,396
- So why'd you dial it again?
- To apologize.

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,910
- You're forgiven. Bye now.
- Wait, wait. Don't hang up.

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,600
- What?
- I wanna talk to you for a second.

11
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,757
They've got 900 numbers for that.
See ya.

12
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,792
- Hello.
- Why don't you want to talk to me?

13
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,595
- Who is this?
- You tell me your name,
I'll tell you mine.

14
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,315
- I don't think so.
- What's that noise?

15
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,510
- Popcorn.
- You're making popcorn?

16
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,359
- Uh-huh.
- I only eat popcorn at the movies.

17
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,677
- Well, I'm getting ready
to watch a video.
- Really? What?

18
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,076
- Oh, just some scary movie.
- Do you like scary movies?

19
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,919
- Uh-huh.
- What's your favourite scary movie?

20
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,713
- Uh, I don't know.
- You have to have a favourite.

21
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,717
What comes to mind?

22
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,308
Um, "Halloween."

23
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,797
You know, the one with the guy
in the white mask who walks around
and stalks baby-sitters.

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,797
- Yeah.
- What's yours?

25
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,232
- Guess.
- Um, "Nightmare on Elm Street".

26
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,035
- Is that the one where the guy
had knives for fingers?
- Yeah, Freddy Krueger.

27
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,709
Freddy, that's right.
I liked that movie. It was scary.

28
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,274
Yeah, the first one was,
but the rest sucked.

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,709
So, you got a boyfriend?

30
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,400
Why? You wanna ask me out
on a date?

31
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,637
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?

32
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,399
- No.
- You never told me your name.

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,149
- Why do you want to know my name?
- 'Cause I want to know
who I'm looking at.

34
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,636
What did you say?

35
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,876
I want to know
who I'm talking to.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,878
- That's not what you said.
- What do you think I said?

37
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,234
What?

38
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,351
Hello?

39
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,995
- Look, I gotta go.
- Wait. I thought we were gonna go out.

40
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,236
Uh, nah, I don't think so.

41
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,432
Don't hang up on me!

42
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,556
Shit. Yes?

43
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,353
I told you not to hang up on me.

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,391
- What do you want?
- To talk.

45
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,193
Well, dial someone else, okay?

46
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,553
- Listen, asshole--
- No, you listen, you little bitch.

47
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,673
You hang up on me again,
I'll cut you like a fish, understand?

48
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,152
- Yeah.
- Is this some kind of joke?

49
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,748
More of a game, really.

50
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,475
Can you handle that, blondie?

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,070
Can you see me?

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,278
Listen. I am two seconds away
from calling the police.

53
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,473
They'd never make it in time.
We're out in the middle of nowhere.

54
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,958
- What do you want?
- To see what your insides look like.

55
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,555
Who's there?

56
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,671
Who's there?

57
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,030
I'm calling the police.

58
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,229
You should never say "Who's there?"
Don't you watch scary movies?
It's a death wish.

59
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,478
You might as well
just come out here to investigate
a strange noise or something.

60
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,674
Look, you've had your fun now, so
I think you better just leave or else.

61
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,552
Or else what?

62
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,912
Or else my boyfriend'll be here
any second and he'll be pissed
when he finds out.

63
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,828
- I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
- I lied! I do have a boyfriend...

64
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,315
and he'll be here any second,
so your ass better be gone.

65
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,352
- Sure.
- I swear.

66
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,232
He's big and he plays football,
and he'll kick the shit out of you!

67
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,114
I'm getting scared.
I'm shaking in my boots.

68
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,231
So you better just leave.

69
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,750
His name wouldn't be Steve,
would it?

70
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,830
How do you know his name?

71
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,428
Turn on the patio lights...

72
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,437
again.

73
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,712
Oh, God!

74
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,991
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Where are you? Where are you?

75
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,111
- Guess.
- Please don't hurt him.

76
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,198
- That all depends on you.
- Why are you doing this?

77
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,629
- I wanna play a game.
- No.

78
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,194
- Then he dies right now.
- No! No! No!

79
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,436
Which is it?

80
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,915
Which is it?

81
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,316
Well, what kind of a game?

82
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,752
Turn off the light.
You'll see what kind of game.

83
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,189
Just do it!

84
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,913
No, Casey! No! No!

85
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,917
No, Casey!

86
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,156
Here's how we play.

87
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,590
I ask a question.
If you get it right, Steve lives.

88
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,234
- Please don't do this.
- Come on, it'll be fun.

89
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,749
- Please--
- It's an easy category.
- Please.

90
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,078
- Movie trivia.
I'll even give you a warm-up question.
- Don't do this. I can't.

91
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,431
- Name the killer in "Halloween."
- No.

92
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,313
Come on! It's your favourite
scary movie, remember?

93
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,512
- He had a white mask.
He stalked the baby-sitters.
- I don't know.

94
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,393
- Come on. Yes, you do.
- No, please.

95
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,159
- What's his name?
- I-- I can't think.

96
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,556
Steve's counting on you.

97
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,989
Michael--
Michael Meyers.

98
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,509
Yes! Very good.

99
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,517
Now for the real question.

100
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,108
- No!
- But you're doing so well.

101
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,073
- We can't stop now.
- Please stop! Leave us alone!

102
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,829
Then answer the question.
Same category.

103
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,349
Oh, please stop.

104
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,358
Name the killer in
"Friday the 13th."

105
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,789
Jason! Jason, Jason!

106
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,276
I'm sorry.
That's the wrong answer.

107
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,039
No, it's not!
No, it's not. It was Jason.

108
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,355
Afraid not. No way.

109
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,075
Listen, it was Jason!
I saw that movie 20 goddam times!

110
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,158
Then you should know Jason's mother,
Mrs Voorhees, was the original killer.

111
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,430
Jason didn't show up
until the sequel.

112
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,393
I'm afraid that was
a wrong answer.

113
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,195
- You tricked me.
- Lucky for you there's a bonus round.

114
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,869
But poor Steve.
I'm afraid he's out!

115
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,072
Hey, we're not finished yet.

116
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,918
Final question.
Are you ready?

117
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,600
Please, please, leave me alone.

118
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,597
Answer the question,
and I will.

119
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,311
What door am I at?

120
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,637
-What?
-There are two main doors to your house.

121
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,637
The front door
and the patio doors.

122
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,799
If you answer correctly,
you live. Very simple.

123
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,037
Don't do this.
I can't. I won't.

124
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,230
Your call.

125
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,675
Did you water
over here today?

126
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,473
- It was just that water from the rain.
- They look great, don't they?

127
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,353
- Don't they smell strong?
- I told you you could send it back.

128
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,749
Mom!

129
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,996
- Jesus!
- What is it?

130
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,197
Casey!

131
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,710
Oh, G--

132
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,435
Casey. Casey. Casey!

133
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,553
- Where is she?
- Call the police!

134
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,356
- Casey! Casey, are you upstairs?
- Oh, my God. Casey, baby?

135
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,630
- Where is she?
- She's-- She's here.

136
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,671
- Mom.
- Oh, my God, l, I can hear her.

137
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,997
- Mom.
- Where is she?

138
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,917
Oh, my God!
I can hear her.

139
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,917
Hey!

140
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,789
Get in the car.
Drive down to the MacKenzies'.

141
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,434
- No. No, not my daughter.
- Just go.

142
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,551
- Not my daughter.
- Call the police.

143
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,950
- It's just me.
- Billy, what the--
What are you doing here?

144
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,913
- Sorry, don't hate me.
- Oh, my God!
- What, do you sleep in that?

145
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,952
Yes, I sleep in this. You gotta go.
My dad is in the other room.
You can't be in here.

146
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,119
- Okay, I'll just stay a sec.
- No-- You can't be in here.
Oh, no. You gotta go. Go, go, go.

147
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,153
-What's going on in there? Are you okay?
-Can you knock?

148
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,910
- I heard screaming.
- No, you didn't.
- No?

149
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,315
Oh, well.
I'm hittin' the sack.

150
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,749
My flight leaves
first thing in the morning.

151
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,031
Now, the expo runs all weekend,
so I won't be back till Sunday.

152
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,469
- There's cash on the table,
and I'm staying at--
- The Hilton.

153
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,194
- Out at the airport, so call if--
- If I need anything. Yeah, I got it.

154
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,197
I could've sworn
I heard screaming.

155
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,752
- Have a good trip, okay?
- Sleep tight, sweetie.

156
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,792
- Oh, close call.
- Billy, what're you doing here?

157
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,879
- Well, it occurred to me that I've
never snuck through your bedroom window.
- Shh, shh, shh.

158
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,230
Great idea. Now that
it's out of your system.

159
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,272
You know, I was home
watching television. The, uh--

160
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,837
"The Exorcist" was on.
It got me thinking of you.

161
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,997
- It did?
- Yeah, it was edited for TV.

162
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,477
You know, all the good stuff was cut
out. And it got me thinking of us...

163
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,755
how two years ago
we started off hot and heavy.

164
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,917
Nice solid R-rating
on our way to an NC-17.

165
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,676
And now
things have changed and...

166
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,629
Iately we're just sort of
edited for television.

167
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:32,517
Oh, so you thought you would
climb in my window and we'd have
a little raw footage?

168
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,714
No. No, I wouldn't dream
of breaking your underwear rule.

169
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,072
I just thought maybe we could do
a little on-top-of-the-clothes stuff.

170
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,392
- Okay.
- Yeah?

171
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,469
- Yeah.
- If we ever fly away

172
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,752
Baby, I'm with you

173
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,476
Baby, I'm your man

174
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,477
Hey.

175
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,118
Okay. Okay, okay.
Time is up, stud-bucket.

176
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,630
God, you see what
you do to me?

177
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,558
You know what
my dad'll do to you?

178
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,877
Yeah. I'm going.

179
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,877
Okay.

180
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,596
Romeo and Juliet

181
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,393
Are together in eternity

182
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,954
You know, l-- I appreciate
the romantic gesture.

183
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,514
So, come on, baby

184
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,110
Hey, about the, uh--
the sex stuff...

185
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,708
I-l'm not trying
to rush you at all.

186
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,038
- I was only half serious.
- Okay.

187
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,197
Baby, I'm your man

188
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,598
Baby, I'm your man

189
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,676
Hey, Billy.

190
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,395
Would you settle for
a PG-13 relationship?

191
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,397
What's that?

192
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,515
My God.
You're just a tease.

193
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,194
Thirty-five--

194
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,834
Situation under control.

195
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,157
Roger, dispatch.

196
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,511
There's blood found?
All right.

197
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,958
They are doing drugs that
they buy in the classrooms...

198
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,036
and that they are
involved in the occult.

199
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,037
Occult?

200
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,400
Woodsboro, California, was devastated
last night when two young teenagers
were found brutally murdered.

201
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,751
Authorities have yet to issue
a statement, but our sources tell us...

202
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,269
that no arrest has been made
and the murderer could strike again.

203
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,233
- Do you believe this shit?
- Damn! What is going on?

204
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,271
- You don't know?
- No.

205
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,552
- Casey Becker and Steve Orth
were killed last night.
- What? No way.

206
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,592
And we're not just talking killed.
We're talking splatter-movie killed.

207
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,597
Ripped open
from end to end.

208
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,032
- Casey Becker, she sits
next to me in English.
- Not any more. It's so sad.

209
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,596
Her mom and dad, they found her hanging
from a tree, her insides on the outside.

210
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,076
Oh, my God!
Do they know who did it?

211
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,272
Fucking clueless. I mean, they're
interrogating the entire school.

212
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,755
- Teachers, students, janitors.
- They think it's school-related?

213
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,350
They don't know. I mean,
Dewey was saying this is the
worst crime they've seen in years.

214
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,550
Even worse than--

215
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,148
Well, it's bad.

216
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,071
- Here you go, Mrs Tate.
- Thank you, James.

217
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,552
Sidney. It would appear
to be your turn.

218
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,596
- Who's up next?
- Uh, Sidney Prescott.
- Prescott.

219
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,280
She was daughter of, uh--

220
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,074
- Sidney, how you feelin'?
- Fine.

221
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,875
- Hi, Sidney.
- Sheriff Burke, Dewey.

222
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,118
Uh, that's Deputy Riley
today, Sid.

223
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,800
- How is everything?
- Good.

224
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,876
And your dad?
How's he doin'?

225
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,118
- We're fine. Thanks.
- We're gonna keep this
very brief, Sidney.

226
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,755
- The police just want to ask you
a few questions. You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

227
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,872
Sidney, were you very
close to Casey Becker?

228
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,390
Remember, your principal loves you,
and I want you to be safe.

229
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,798
All students are encouraged
to return to their homes promptly
from school grounds. Avoid strangers.

230
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,514
- Walk in twos and threes.
Counsellors will be here tomorrow.
- What kind of questions
did they ask you, Sidney?

231
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,074
- Thank you.
- They asked if I knew Casey.
- Yeah, they asked me that too.

232
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,475
- Hey, did they ask if you like to hunt?
- Yeah, they did.

233
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,388
- Did they ask you?
- Hunt? Why would they ask you
if you like to hunt?

234
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,034
'Cause their bodies
were gutted.

235
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,958
- Thank you, Randy.
- They didn't ask me if I like to hunt.

236
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,958
- It's 'cause there's no way
a girl could've killed 'em.
- That is so sexist.

237
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,548
The killer could easily be female.
"Basic lnstinct."

238
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,875
That was an ice pick.
Not exactly the same thing.

239
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,355
Yeah, Casey and Steve
were completely hollowed out.

240
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,233
And the fact is, it takes a man
to do something like that.

241
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,239
- Or a man's mentality.
- How do you gut someone?

242
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,674
You take a knife, and you slit 'em
from the groin to sternum.

243
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,872
Hey, it's called tact,
you fuck rag.

244
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,753
Hey, Stu, didn't you
used to date Casey?

245
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,316
- Yeah, for like two seconds.
- Before she dumped you for Steve.

246
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,670
- I thought you dumped her for me.
- I did. He's full of shit.

247
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,189
And are the police aware
that you dated the victim?

248
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,788
Hey, what're you saying?
That-- That-- That I killed her?

249
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,277
- It would certainly improve
your high school "Q."
- Stu was with me last night, okay?

250
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,996
- Yeah, I was.
- Was that before or after
he sliced and diced?

251
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,396
- Fuck you, nut case.
Where were you last night?
- Working, thank you.

252
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,674
- Oh, at the video store?
I thought they fired your sorry ass.
- Twice.

253
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,270
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Nobody said you did.

254
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,111
Thanks, buddy. Besides, it takes a man
to do something like that.

255
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,360
- I'm gonna gut your ass
in a second, kid.
- Tell me something. Did you really
put her liver in the mailbox?

256
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,359
'Cause I heard that they
found her liver in the mailbox
next to her spleen and her pancreas.

257
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,914
Randy, you goon! Fuck!
I'm trying to eat here. Okay?

258
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,396
She's getting mad, all right?
You better "liver" alone.

259
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,953
"Liver" alone!

260
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,950
"Liv--" Ow! "Liver. Liver. Liv--"
It was a joke.

261
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,352
See you, Sidney.
I'll talk to you tomorrow, Sid.

262
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,395
So, you sure I can stay over, 'cause
my dad won't be back till Sunday.

263
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,990
No problem.
I'll pick you up after practise.

264
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,997
You okay?

265
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,351
Uh-huh. It's just, you know,
the police and reporters...

266
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,994
and everything,
it's like deja vu all over again.

267
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,395
I'll be there by 7:00,
I promise.

268
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,397
- Thanks, Tatum.
- Later.

269
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,190
The bodies of 17-year-old Casey Becker
and her 18-year-old boyfriend
Steven Orth...

270
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,197
were discovered late last night
by the girl's parents--

271
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:38,553
The Woodsboro double murder case.
Authorities are baffled by the lack
of clues and the savage--

272
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,558
The town's in shock, and no one can
quite believe what has happened here...

273
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,240
although this is not the first
time this small community...

274
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,635
of Woodsboro has endured
such tragedy.

275
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,149
Only a year ago Maureen Prescott,
wife and mother...

276
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,512
was found raped and murdered not far
from this peaceful town square.

277
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,870
- Hello?
- Practise ran late.
I'm on my way, okay?

278
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,953
- It's past 7:00.
- Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't
bite it till way after 10:00.

279
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,231
Oh. Oh, that's comforting.

280
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,989
I'm gonna swing by the video store.
I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in
"All The Right Moves."

281
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,680
You know, if you pause it just right,
you can see his penis.

282
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,758
- Whatever. Just hurry, okay?
- Ta-ta, Sid.

283
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,159
- Tatum, just get in the car--
- Hello, Sidney.

284
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,829
Uh, hi, who is this?

285
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,837
You tell me.

286
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,749
- Well, l-l have no idea.
- Scary night, isn't it?

287
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:55,318
With the murders and all,
it's like right out of
a horror movie or something.

288
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,353
Randy, you gave yourself away.
Are you calling from work,
'cause Tatum's on her way over.

289
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,517
Do you like scary movies,
Sidney?

290
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,712
I like that thing you're doing
with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.

291
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,354
What's your favourite
scary movie?

292
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,109
- Oh, come on.
You know I don't watch that shit.
- Why not? Too scared?

293
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,879
No, no. It's just, what's the point?
They're all the same.

294
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,798
Some stupid killer stalking
some big-breasted girl who can't act...

295
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,195
who's always running up the stairs when
she should be going out the front door.

296
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,598
- It's insulting.
- Are you alone in the house?

297
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,359
Randy, that's so unoriginal.
I'm disappointed in you.

298
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,438
Maybe that's because
I'm not Randy.

299
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,191
- So, who are you?
- The question isn't "Who am l?"

300
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,471
The question is
"Where am l?"

301
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,394
S-S-So, where are you?

302
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,795
Your front porch.

303
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,995
Why would you be calling
from my front porch?

304
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,509
That's the original part.

305
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,036
Oh, yeah?

306
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,357
Well, I call your bluff.

307
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,271
- So, where are you?
- Right here.

308
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,632
- Can you see me right now?
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh. Okay.

309
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,513
What am I doin'? Huh?

310
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,712
Huh? What am I doin'?
Hello!

311
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,951
Nice try, Randy. Tell Tatum
to hurry up, okay? Bye now.

312
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,674
If you hang up on me,
you'll die just like your mother!

313
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,189
Do you wanna die, Sidney?
Your mother sure didn't.

314
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,511
Fuck you, you cretin!

315
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,069
No!

316
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,716
Shit!

317
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,911
- Billy!
- The door's locked.
I heard screaming. You all right?

318
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,679
The killer's here. He's in the house.
No, he's in the house.

319
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,677
He's got a knife.
He's gonna kill us.

320
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:50,157
He's gone. He's gone.
It's all right.

321
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,790
What?

322
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,277
Sid, what?

323
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,679
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
Wait, Sidney, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

324
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,394
What's going on?
Sidney, come back!

325
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,556
Sidney!

326
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,638
Sorry! I found this.
Come on!

327
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,070
- All right, hold your hands together.
- Do you wish to give up your right
to remain silent?

328
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,272
- I didn't do anything.
- Do you wish to give up your
right to speak to an attorney...

329
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,277
and have them present
during questioning?

330
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,914
Ask her. She'll tell you.
Ask her.

331
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,157
- What do you got, Dewey?
- I caught him, Sheriff.
- Wait, who is that?

332
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,238
- Billy Loomis.
- Sheriff, Sheriff, call these guys off.

333
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,874
- I didn't do it.
- Let's go.

334
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,560
Sheriff, wait!
Wait, listen. Call my dad.

335
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,194
Please, call him.
He'll tell you. Just call him.

336
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,198
Sidney! Sidney!

337
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,039
- How's she doing?
- Sid's tougher than she looks.

338
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,994
- She'd have to be,
all the shit she's been through.
- Sid!

339
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,873
Well, we're seein'
a lot of you today.

340
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,878
You gonna be able to come down to the
station and answer a few questions, Sid?

341
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,197
Oh, shit, Sidney! God, Sid, I'm so sorry
I was late. Are you all right?

342
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,471
- Tatum, you can't be here.
This is an official crime scene.
- It's okay.

343
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,433
Her dad's out of town, all right?
She's staying with us tonight.

344
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,869
- Does Mom know?
- Yes, doofus.

345
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,719
- Let's get you out of here.
- She'll be okay.
- Thanks.

346
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,116
- Come on, Sid.
- Oh, you won't believe this.

347
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,480
Creepy, huh?

348
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,753
- I'll be damned.
- What?
- Jesus! The camera, hurry!

349
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,155
My name isn't Jesus.

350
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,116
Sidney, is that you in there? Excuse me.
Is that Sidney Prescott they took away?

351
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,117
- I'm not talking to you.
- What happened to her?

352
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,949
- None of your damn business.
- I heard something about
a costume. Is that true?

353
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,629
- Can you tell me anything?
- Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass.

354
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,910
Leave Sid alone.

355
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,759
Where's she goin'?

356
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,440
- Look. Kenny?
- Yeah?

357
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,394
I know that you're about 50 pounds
overweight, but when I say "hurry"...

358
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:14,435
please interpret that as
"move your fat, tub-of-lard ass now!"

359
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,759
- Did you find him?
- Are you sure it was the Hilton?

360
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,317
- At the airport.
- He's not registered there.

361
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,674
Could he have stayed
somewhere else?

362
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,598
I don't know. I guess.

363
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,153
- Don't worry, Sid. We'll find him.
- Dewey, they got that mask in.

364
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:43,158
- Roger, dispatch.
- I'll be right back.

365
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,759
Hold on a minute.

366
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:54,636
Let me ask you this. What're you
doin' with a cellular telephone, son?

367
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,320
Everybody's got one, Sheriff.

368
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,115
- I didn't make those calls, I swear.
- Why don't you check the phone bill,
for Christ's sake!

369
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:06,917
- Call Vital Phone Comp. They got
the records of every number dialled.
- Thanks, Hank. We're on top of it.

370
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,670
- What were you doing over
at Sidney's house tonight?
- I wanted to see her, that's all.

371
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,349
And last night? Sidney said you crawled
through her window last night too.

372
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,392
You went out last night?

373
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,717
I was watchin' TV. I got bored.
I decided to go for a ride.

374
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,876
Did you happen to ride by
Casey Becker's house?

375
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,790
No. No, I didn't.
Sheriff, I didn't kill anybody!

376
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,872
We're gonna have to hold you, son,
till we get those phone records.

377
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,754
This is crazy.

378
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,031
You know that?
I didn't do it.

379
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,430
- Camera Two?
- Go. I do.
- Okay.

380
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,835
Are there any more
doughnuts in there?

381
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,076
- Move it, Kenny.
- They're not lettin' anybody in.

382
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,078
- I'm not just anyone.
- Bitch goddess.

383
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,273
- Kenny, are we on?
- Yeah, go.
- Hi, Gale Weathers reporting live
from Woodsboro police station...

384
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,755
- Hey, where's she going?
- where we hope to get a glimpse
of Sidney Prescott.

385
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,270
- Hey, watch it, lady.
- Hey, watch the hand! Do you
know who you're dealing with?
- No cameras, please.

386
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,153
Tell 'em.
Come on, Dad. Tell 'em!

387
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,350
- He's waiting for the lawyer, Billy.
- Sidney!

388
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,630
- Sidney, come on. You know me.
- All right, come on.

389
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,399
- Sidney, look at me!
- Don't give us any trouble.

390
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,511
Come on!

391
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,395
Sid, we're gonna get you out of here,
okay? Are you okay?

392
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,837
They sell this costume
at every five-and-dime in the state.

393
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,077
There's no way
to track the purchase.

394
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,829
- What about that cellular phone bill?
- Well, we're pulling Loomis's account.

395
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,996
We won't know anything
until the morning.

396
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,759
Oh, come on!

397
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,668
- You think he did it?
- Twenty years ago,
I would've said, "Not a chance."

398
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:02,078
But these kids today,
damned if I know.

399
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,237
- Hey, Dewey, can we go now?
- Hold on a second.

400
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,510
Goddamn it, Dewey!

401
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,110
What did Mama tell you?
When I wear this badge,
you treat me like a man of the law!

402
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,189
- I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy,
but we're ready to go. Now, okay?
- Whoa.

403
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,711
Uh, take 'em out the back way.
Avoid that circus out there.

404
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,070
- Come on.
- Don't touch me!

405
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,351
- He's my superior.
- The janitor is your superior.

406
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,558
Let's get back to work!

407
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:41,116
- Isn't there a back way
out of this building?
- Yeah. Down that alley, I think.

408
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,593
You guys just stay here. I'm gonna get
the car. Don't move. Don't make a sound.

409
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,353
There she is. Sidney!

410
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,199
Hi. That was some night.
What happened? Are you all right?

411
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,551
- She's not answering any questions,
all right? Just leave us alone.
- No. No. Tatum. It's okay.

412
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,195
- She's just doin' her job, right, Gale?
- Yes, that's right.

413
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,312
- So, how's the book?
- Well, it'll be out later this year.

414
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,590
Oh, I'll look for it.

415
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,076
I'll send you a copy.

416
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,159
- Jeez. Nice shot.
- Bitch!

417
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,158
- No, I mean, camera shot.
- Where'd you learn to punch like that?

418
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,953
God, I loved it.
"l'll send you a copy."

419
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,275
Bam! Bitch went down.

420
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,713
"l'll send you a copy." Bam!
Sid-- Superbitch! You are so cool.

421
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,229
Thought you might want
some ice for that right hook.

422
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,396
Thanks.

423
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,592
I'll be right next door.
Try to get some sleep.

424
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,915
Yeah, yeah.

425
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,598
Do you really think
Billy did it?

426
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,553
He was there, Tatum.

427
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:56,073
He was destined to have a flaw.
I knew he was too perfect.

428
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,078
- Telephone, honey.
- Who is it?
- It's for Sid.

429
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,794
- My dad?
- I don't think so.

430
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,559
- Take a message.
- No, um, I'll get it.

431
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,636
How's she doin'?

432
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,388
- Hello.
- Hello, Sidney.

433
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,830
- No!
- Poor Billy-boyfriend.

434
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,635
- An innocent guy doesn't stand
a chance with you.
- Leave me alone!

435
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,469
- Looks like you fingered
the wrong guy again.
- Dewey!

436
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,273
- Who are you?
- Dewey!
- Hang up, Sid.
- Don't worry.

437
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,109
-You'll find out soon enough. I promise.
-Dewey!

438
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,591
What?

439
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,392
- What?
- What?

440
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,070
Hello.

441
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,989
Sidney Prescott, who escaped
a vicious attack last night...

442
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,635
is the daughter of Maureen Prescott
who was brutally killed last year...

443
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,433
when convicted murderer Cotton Weary
broke into their home...

444
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,313
and savagely raped
and tortured the deceased.

445
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,034
Cotton Weary is currently awaiting
appeal for the death sentence...

446
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,277
handed down after the young Sidney
testified against him.

447
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,870
She was the key witness in
the State's case against the--

448
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,797
It's never gonna stop,
is it?

449
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,309
Billy was released.

450
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,671
His cellular bill was clean.
He didn't make those calls.

451
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,473
We're checkin' every cellular account
in the county.

452
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,479
Any calls made to you or Casey Becker
are being cross-referenced.

453
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,673
It's gonna take some time,
but we'll find him.

454
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,394
You okay?

455
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,594
Don't worry, Sid, it's school.
You'll be safe here.

456
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,951
- So how does it feel to be almost
brutally butchered?
- Hey! Hey, now leave her alone.
- Come on, Sid.

457
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,469
- People wanna know.
They have a right to know.
- Leave her alone.

458
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:15,958
- How does it feel?
- She just wants to get an education.
Turn that thing off.

459
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,957
What?

460
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,874
Just a sec.

461
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,356
- Stop right there.
- I'm not here to fight.
I just need to talk.

462
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,313
- Kenny, camera, now!
- Off the record. No camera.

463
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,954
- Forget it.
- Please? You owe me.

464
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,389
- I owe you shit!
- You owe my mother!

465
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:49,358
Your mother's murder was last year's
hottest court case. Somebody was gonna
write a book about it.

466
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,473
- Right. And it had to be you with
all your lies and bullshit theories.
- What is your problem?

467
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:58,754
You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary's
in jail. They're gonna gas him.
A book is not gonna change that.

468
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,829
- Do you still think he's innocent?
- Your testimony put him away.

469
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,996
It doesn't really matter
what I think.

470
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,430
During the trial, you did all those
stories about me. You called me a liar.

471
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,597
I think you falsely
identified him, yes.

472
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,632
- Have you talked to Cotton?
- Many times.

473
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,797
- And has his story changed?
- Not one word.

474
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,434
He admits to having sex
with your mother, but that's all.

475
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,869
He's lying.
She never would've touched him.

476
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,869
He raped her, and then he-- he butchered
her. Her blood was all over his coat.

477
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,471
He was drunk that night.
He left his coat at your house
after your mother seduced him.

478
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,230
- I saw him leave wearing it.
- No, you saw someone leave
wearing that coat.

479
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:44,878
The same someone who planted it
in Cotton's car, framing him.

480
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,039
No. Cotton murdered my mother.

481
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,191
You're not so sure
any more, are you?

482
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,756
Nice welt, sweetie.
Let's go, Sid.

483
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,713
- The killer's still
on the loose, isn't he?
- Come on, Sid.

484
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,469
- Those murders are related.
- I'm sorry I mangled your face.

485
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,831
- Wait, Sidney, don't go!
- Just stop, all right?

486
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,036
Jesus Christ!
An innocent man on death row.

487
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,720
- A killer still on the loose.
Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
- You wanna go live?

488
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,479
No, no, no. Not so fast.
We don't have anything concrete.

489
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:27,071
-This is huge. You can't just sit on it.
-I know! That's why we need proof.

490
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,034
If I'm right about this,
I could save a man's life.

491
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,311
Do you know what that
could do for my book sales?

492
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,750
This is a mistake.
I shouldn't be here.

493
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,236
I want you to meet me right
here after class, okay, Sid?

494
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,715
All right.

495
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,753
Hey, I haven't seen Billy around.
Is he really pissed?

496
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,996
Oh, you mean after you
branded him the Candyman?

497
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,237
- No, his heart's broken. Ow!
- Stu!

498
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,150
Why are they doing this?

499
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,272
Are you kidding me?
Look at this place. It's like Christmas.

500
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,709
- Stupidity leak.
- Ow. Easy.

501
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,354
Sidney!

502
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,869
- Ow!
- Jesus! Shit!

503
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,719
It's just me.

504
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,593
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You still think it's me.

505
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,950
No. No, l-l don't.

506
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,595
- It's just somebody was there.
- Hey, Christy, wait up!

507
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,029
- Billy, someone--
someone tried to kill me.
- I know. I know. I know.

508
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,233
The cops said I scared him away.
It wasn't me, Sid.

509
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,511
I know. He called me again
last night at Tatum's house.

510
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:40,191
You see? It couldn't have been me.
I was in jail. Remember?

511
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,550
I'm so sorry.
Please understand.

512
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,275
Understand what? That I have a
girlfriend who would rather accuse me...

513
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,914
of being a psychopathic killer
than touch me?

514
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,070
- You know that's not true.
- Then what is it?

515
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,478
What is it? Billy, I was attacked
and nearly filleted last night!

516
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,511
I mean between us.

517
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,074
You haven't been
the same since--

518
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,955
- Since your mother died.
- Is your brain leaking?

519
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,719
My mom was killed. I can't believe
you're bringing this up!

520
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,389
- It's been a year.
- Tomorrow! One year tomorrow.

521
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,798
I know. I think it's time
you got over that. I mean,
when my mom left my dad, I accepted it.

522
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,878
It's the way it is.
She's not comin' back.

523
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,912
Your parents split up.
This is not the same thing.

524
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,315
Your mom left town.
She's not lying in a coffin somewhere.

525
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,956
Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry.
It's-- It's a bad analogy.

526
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,991
But it's just that...

527
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,997
I want my girlfriend back.

528
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,759
- Sid!
- Billy, I am sorry
if my traumatized life...

529
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,872
is an inconvenience to you
and your perfect existence.

530
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,958
What? What are you--
Nobody said that. Sid!

531
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,715
- Stupid.
- You make me so sick!

532
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:59,834
Your entire havoc-inducing, thieving,
whoring generation disgusts me!

533
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:05,114
So, two of your fellow students
just savagely murdered...

534
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,312
and this is the way that you show
your compassion and sensitivity, huh?

535
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,910
Let me tell you something.
You're both expelled! Get out!

536
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,793
Oh, come on, Mr Himbry!
It was just a joke.

537
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,036
Yeah, that's not fair!

538
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,635
You're absolutely right.
It is not fair.

539
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,877
Fairness would be to rip your
insides out, hang you from a tree...

540
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,993
so we can expose you for the heartless,
desensitized little shits that you are.

541
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,470
- She was never attacked.
I think she made it all up.
- Why would she lie about it?

542
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,876
For attention!
The girl has some serious issues.

543
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,873
What if she did it? What if
Sidney killed Casey and Steve?

544
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,877
And why would she do that?

545
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,197
Maybe she had the hots for Steve and
killed them both in a jealous rage.

546
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:09,519
What would Sidney want with Steve?
She has her own bubble-butt
boyfriend, Billy.

547
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,313
Maybe she's a slut
just like her mother.

548
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,716
- You're evil.
- Please, it's a common fact.

549
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,310
- Her mother was a tramp.
- Cut some slack.
She watched her mom get butchered.

550
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,590
Yeah, and it fucked her up royally.
Think about it.

551
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,154
Her mother's death
leaves her disturbed and hostile.

552
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,636
In a cruel and inhumane world,
she's delusional.

553
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,558
Where is God? Etcetera.
Completely suicidal.

554
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,274
One day she snaps.
She wants to kill herself...

555
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,551
but she realizes that teen suicide
is out this year...

556
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,468
and homicide is a much healthier,
therapeutic expression.

557
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,956
- Where do you get this shit?
- "Ricki Lake."

558
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,435
You are pathetic.

559
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,190
Pathetic.

560
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,356
Sidney.

561
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,233
Sidney.

562
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,353
Is someone there?

563
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,113
In what appears to be a prank, several
students were seen wearing scary masks.

564
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,356
School officials
have yet to comment...

565
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,995
but this is known to be
the same costume worn by the killer.

566
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:28,830
Seventeen-year-old Casey Becker
and her boyfriend Steven Orth
have already lost their lives.

567
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,556
Who's next? You can literally feel
the fear on this campus.

568
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,831
Hi. Gale Weathers,
field correspondent, "Top Story."

569
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,997
I know who you are, Miss Weathers.
How's the eye?

570
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,634
It's productive.
Is there a problem on campus?

571
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,716
No, everything's under control.

572
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,116
- Well, of course. You're here.
- You're not supposed to be here.

573
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:53,314
I know. I should be in New York
covering the Sharon Stone stalker,
but who knew?

574
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,036
- You look awfully young
to be a police officer.
- I'm 25 years old.

575
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:03,473
You know, in a demographic study
I proved to be most popular
amongst males 11 to 24.

576
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,593
Guess I just missed you.
Of course, you don't look a day over 12.

577
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:11,793
Except in that upper torso area.
Does the force require you to work out?

578
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,390
No, ma'am.
Because of my boyish good looks...

579
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,513
muscle mass has increased my acceptance
as a serious police officer.

580
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:23,428
I need your attention now, kids. Due to
the recent events that have occurred...

581
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:28,509
effective immediately, all classes
are suspended until further notice.

582
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,916
The Woodsboro police department
has issued a citywide curfew...

583
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,191
beginning at 9:00 tonight.

584
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,436
Looks like we've got
a serial killer on our hands.

585
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,790
Well, serial killer's
not really accurate.

586
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,150
Gotta knock off a couple more
to get that title.

587
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,158
Well, we can hope,
can't we?

588
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,475
I mean, we certainly
don't have any leads.

589
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,229
- Have you located Sidney's father yet?
- No, not yet.

590
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:56,388
- Well, he's not a suspect, is he?
- We haven't ruled him out
as a possibility.

591
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,830
- If you'll excuse me.
- I'm sorry. Am I keeping you?

592
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,839
If I may say so,
Miss Weathers...

593
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,952
you are much prettier in person.

594
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,116
So you do watch the show.

595
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,590
I'm 25.
I was 24 for a whole year.

596
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,837
Please, call me Gale!

597
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,155
It was just some sick fuck
having a laugh, Sidney.

598
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,236
No, it was him, Tatum.
I know it.

599
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:27,433
Well, you're not to be alone any more.
If you pee, I pee. Is that clear?

600
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,755
"Kizzo-kaskizzo is is-out."

601
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:33,998
I don't know what you did, Sidney,
but on behalf of the entire student
body, we all say, "Thank you!"

602
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,554
- Drop it, Stu.
- No, I say...

603
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,989
an impromptu party tonight,
my house.

604
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:42,999
- Celebrate this little siesta.
What do you say?
- Are you serious?

605
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:47,238
As long as this little vixen doesn't
invite the entire world, we'll be fine.

606
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,430
Intimate gathering,
intimate friends.

607
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:53,109
What do you say, Sid?
I mean, pathos could have its perks?

608
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,596
I will totally protect you. Yo,
I am so buff. I got you covered, girl.

609
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,429
- No.
- Come on, Sid. For me?

610
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,869
It could be fun.

611
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,549
- Okay. Whatever.
- Yeah? Nice.

612
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,353
Cool. You guys
bring food, all right?

613
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,710
Yes?

614
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,717
Hello?

615
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,516
- Damn little shits.
- What'd you call me? Huh?

616
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,313
- Not you, Fred.
- You prick.

617
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,719
School's out for summer

618
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,674
- School's out
- What if Cotton Weary
is telling the truth?

619
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,156
- With fever
- Maybe he was having
an affair with your mom.

620
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,716
- I mean, your dad was always
out of town on business. Maybe--
- School's out

621
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,991
- Completely
- Maybe your mom was just
a very unhappy woman.

622
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:34,999
If-- If they were having
an affair, then how come
Cotton couldn't prove it in court?

623
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,709
Well, you can't prove a rumour.
That's why it's a rumour.

624
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,674
Right. Created by that little
tabloid twit Gale Weathers.

625
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:50,359
It goes further back, Sid.
There's been talk about other men.

626
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,789
And you believe it.

627
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:58,119
Well, I mean,
you can only hear that Richard Gere
gerbil story so many times...

628
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,312
before you have to start
believing it.

629
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,431
Oh, I'm sorry.

630
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:14,637
You know, if-if I was wrong
about Cotton Weary, then
the killer's still out there.

631
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,878
Don't go there, Sid.
You're starting to sound like
some Wes Carpenter flick or something.

632
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,039
Don't freak yourself out, okay? We've
got a long night ahead of us. Okay?

633
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,637
Let's boogie.

634
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,468
- It's alive!
- Henry!

635
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,433
Oh, in the name of God,
now I know--

636
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,437
Excuse me, dude.

637
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,236
- Watch it, jerk.
- I'm sorry.

638
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,350
Dork.

639
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,119
Jesus, this place
is packed tonight, man.

640
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,391
- We had a run
in the mass murder section.
- Comin' to my fiesta?

641
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,273
- Yeah, I'm off early. Curfew, you know.
- Cool.

642
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,709
What's that werewolf movie
with E.T.'s mom in it?

643
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,752
- "The Howling." Horror. Straight ahead.
- Okay, thanks.

644
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:07,438
- Oh, now that's in poor taste.
- What?

645
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,552
If you were the only suspect
in a senseless bloodbath...

646
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,989
would you be standing
in the horror section?

647
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:17,272
What? It was just a misunderstanding.
He didn't do anything.

648
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,359
You're such a little lapdog. He's got
"killer" printed all over his forehead.

649
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:26,190
Okay! Really? Well, why'd the cops
let him go, smart guy?

650
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:30,199
Because obviously
they don't watch enough movies.
This is standard horror movie stuff.

651
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:34,711
- "Prom Night" revisited, man.
- Yeah? Why would he wanna
kill his own girlfriend?

652
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,718
There's always some stupid,
bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend.

653
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,196
- Oh?
- That's the beauty of it all:
simplicity.

654
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,790
Besides, if it gets too complicated,
you lose your target audience.

655
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,309
Well, what's his reason?

656
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,398
Maybe Sidney
wouldn't have sex with him.

657
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,670
- What, is she savin' herself for you?
- Maybe.

658
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,237
Now that Billy tried to mutilate her,
do you think Sid would go out with me?

659
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,790
No, I don't at all. No.

660
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,151
You know who I think it is?

661
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,669
You know, I think
it's her father.

662
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,075
Why can't they find
her pops, man?

663
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,953
Because he's probably dead.

664
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,674
His body will come poppin' up
in the last reel somewhere!

665
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,315
Eyes gouged out, fingers cut off,
teeth knocked out!

666
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,715
- See, the police are always
off track with this shit.
- Man!

667
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,876
If they'd watch "Prom Night,"
they'd save time.

668
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,391
There's a formula to it. A very simple
formula! Everybody's a suspect!

669
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:41,232
I'm telling you, the dad's
a red herring. It's Billy.

670
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:45,638
How do we know you're
not the killer? Huh? Huh?

671
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,912
- Hi, Billy.
- Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost its
reality button. You ever think of that?

672
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,110
You're absolutely right.
I'm the first to admit it.

673
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,676
- If this were a scary movie,
I'd be the prime suspect.
- That's right.

674
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,268
And what would be
your motive?

675
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,109
It's the millennium.
Motives are incidental.

676
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,231
"Millennium."

677
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:08,319
"Millennium." I like that.
That's good. It's the millennium.

678
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,597
Good kid.

679
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,280
"Millennium."
Good word, my man.

680
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,277
Are you telling me
that's not a killer?

681
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,549
You'll see him
in your nightmares

682
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,274
You'll see him
in your dreams

683
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,872
He'll appear
out of nowhere

684
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,036
But he ain't

685
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,072
What he seems

686
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,191
You'll see him in your head

687
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,356
On the TV screen

688
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,870
Hey, buddy
I'm warnin' you to turn it off

689
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,195
Ah, he's a ghost
He's a god

690
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,551
He's a man
He's a guru

691
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,312
You're one microscopic cog
in his catastrophic plan

692
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:00,275
Designed and directed
by his red right hand

693
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,472
Sure is quiet.

694
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,558
God, look at this place.
It's "The Town That Dreaded Sundown."

695
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:10,639
Yeah, I saw that movie.
It's about a killer in Texas, huh?

696
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:14,116
Hey, Sid, just think. If they make a
movie about you, who's gonna play you?

697
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,949
- I shudder to think.
- I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.

698
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:21,436
Thanks, Dewey. With my luck,
they'd cast Tori Spelling.

699
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,199
I'm just gonna be
a few minutes.

700
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,153
You girls don't go too far.

701
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,068
- Is Billy gonna be there tonight?
- He better not be.

702
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:35,910
I told Stu to keep his mouth shut.
I think we can live without
the endorphin rush for one night.

703
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,032
Billy's right, you know. Whenever
he touches me, I just can't relax.

704
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,709
So you have a few intimacy issues as a
result of your mother's untimely death.

705
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,035
It's no big deal, Sid.
I mean, you'll thaw out.

706
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:50,277
Yeah, but he has been so patient with
me, you know, with all the sex stuff.

707
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,109
How many guys would put up with
a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?

708
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,357
Billy and his penis
don't deserve you, all right?

709
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:09,719
- Dewey, where the hell you been?
- I was keepin' an eye on Sidney, uh--

710
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:15,518
- Thought you quit.
- I did. But damn it--

711
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:19,428
Dewey, Vital Phone
just faxed us.

712
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:23,473
Those calls are listed
to Neil Prescott, Sidney's father.

713
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:27,718
He made the calls with a cellular phone.
It's been confirmed.

714
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,593
There's no way a cellular
could've been cloned?

715
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,518
There's more.
Guess what tomorrow is.

716
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:36,359
The anniversary
of his wife's death.

717
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,240
We'll keep the roadblocks and the curfew
in effect through the night.

718
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,636
If he's not picked up by morning,
then we'll do a house-to-house.

719
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:49,510
- Where's Sidney?
- She's with my sister.
You want me to bring her in?

720
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,518
No. Not just yet.

721
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:56,394
Let's find Neil first,
make sure he's our man.

722
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,955
You stay close to Sidney.
Don't let her out of your sight.

723
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,674
Yes, sir.

724
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,591
Say a prayer
for the youth of America

725
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,872
God bless the youth
of America

726
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,995
And I can't stand
their sight any more

727
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,236
All right,
you girls have fun.

728
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,954
Not too much fun,
or I'll bust ya.

729
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,960
- Bye.
- Bye, Sid.

730
00:58:54,160 --> 00:59:00,030
You're obsessed

731
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:04,631
You're obsessed

732
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,637
Here, kids!

733
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:12,789
- Oh, that's mature.
- You guys were tardy for the party,
so we started without you.

734
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,150
My man!

735
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:37,034
- Well, were we spotted?
- I don't think so. Go get the camera.

736
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,397
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare ya.

737
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:45,433
- Deputy, that's okay.
- What brings you to these parts?

738
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:49,599
Well, you just never know
when or where a story will break.

739
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:53,838
Not much of a story here.
Just a bunch of kids cuttin' it loose.

740
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,520
Then what are you
doing here?

741
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,355
Just keepin' an eye
on things.

742
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,233
I'm gonna check the party out.

743
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:07,592
- Do you mind if I join you?
- Not at all.

744
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,792
All right.
Let me just get my coat. Thanks.

745
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,277
- All right.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

746
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,277
Oh! Yeah.

747
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,433
- How many "Evil Deads?"
- One!
- Two!

748
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,074
- How many "Hellraisers?"
- Hellraiser right here.

749
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:31,078
"The Fog," "Terror Train,"
"Prom Night."

750
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,431
How come Jamie Lee Curtis
is in all of these movies?

751
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,915
She's the scream queen.

752
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,032
- With a set of lungs like that,
she should be.
- Yeah.

753
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,550
- Tits. See?
- Oh, I'll get it.

754
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,276
- Hey, Tate, grab me
another beer, would ya?
- There's more beer in the garage.

755
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,995
- What am l, the beer wench?
- She was nominated--

756
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,873
- She was nominated for "Terror Train."
- You're not gonna believe who's here!

757
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,117
- It's that chick from "Top Story!"
- Gale Weathers?
- Here!

758
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,073
- Shit!
- You're under age, son.

759
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:06,518
I'm kiddin'. Have a good time.
Watch the drivin'.

760
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,631
- Dewey.
- Hi.

761
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,716
Dewey.

762
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,752
- What is she doing here?
- She's with me.

763
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,758
- I'm just checkin' things out.
- So you did.

764
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,190
Now leave, and take
your media mouth with you.

765
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,388
- I just think you're awesome.
- Oh, thank you very much.

766
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,397
- I watch your show religiously.
- That's great.

767
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,750
- Hey.
- Hey.

768
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,633
I need a camera.

769
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,513
- Have you found my father?
- I'm afraid not.

770
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,236
- Should I be worried?
- Not yet.

771
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,916
- Get out, you're walkin'
- That's the one I want.

772
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:47,316
Too bad, I've spoken

773
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,874
When I look at you
you're forgiven

774
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,595
You're forgiven

775
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,277
Jesus!

776
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,994
Tatum, it's okay.

777
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,229
Shit.

778
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,477
Hey, shitheads!

779
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,837
Hello!

780
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,913
Shit. Piss.

781
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:18,436
Is that you, Randy?

782
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:21,791
Cute. What movie is this from?
"l Spit On Your Garage?"

783
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,556
Lose the outfit.
If Sidney sees it, she'll flip.

784
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,433
Oh, you wanna play
psycho killer?

785
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:32,028
Can I be
the helpless victim?

786
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,789
Okay, let's see-- No, please
don't kill me, Mr Ghost Face.

787
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,309
I wanna be in the sequel!

788
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,752
Cut, Casper.
That's a wrap.

789
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,790
Randy, what the hell
are you doing?

790
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,915
Stop!

791
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,788
Fucker!

792
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,395
No! No!

793
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,638
- Happy curfew.
- Nice party, Stu.

794
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,513
- Tatum, come on!
- There's nobody here but us chickens!

795
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:08,438
- Do you know where she is?
- No, I haven't seen her.

796
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,834
Oh. Billy. Hey.

797
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,838
Billy. Hmm.
What are you doin' here?

798
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,155
I was hoping I could talk
to Sid alone.

799
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,589
You know, if Tatum sees you here,
she'll draw blood.

800
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,950
I tell you what. Why don't you guys
go up to my parents' room?

801
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:27,756
You know, you guys
can talk, whatever.

802
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,952
Subtlety, Stu.
You should look it up.

803
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,196
No, i-it's okay.
We do need to talk.

804
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:46,674
- What's Leatherface doin' here?
- Cute. He came to make up.

805
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,553
There goes my chance with Sid.
Damn it.

806
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,636
As if.
That's all I'm sayin'.

807
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,637
As if.

808
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,433
Oh, really, Alicia?

809
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,279
"As if."
I'm gonna go check on them.

810
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:02,995
- Come on!
- Okay, everyone.
It was nice to meet all of you.

811
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,315
- Thank you.
- Stick around.

812
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,556
You're a genius.

813
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,319
- Oh, shit.
- What?

814
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,510
- I got a delay.
- How long is it?

815
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,552
I don't know. What'd it take you
to walk from the house, 30 seconds?

816
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,636
- It'll be fine. Just record it.
- All right.

817
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,832
Oh, the placement is perfect.
Tell me, Kenneth--

818
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,191
Has a cheesy tabloid journalist
ever won the Pulitzer?

819
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:28,279
- Well, first time for everything.
- You're damn right.

820
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,517
S-So, um--

821
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,997
So--

822
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,033
Look, I'm sorry.

823
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:50,153
I've been selfish,
and I want to apologize.

824
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,999
No, Billy, l-l'm...

825
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:56,476
the one who's been selfish
and self-absorbed...

826
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,909
with all this
post-traumatic stress.

827
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,996
- You lost your mom.
- Yeah, I know, but you're right.

828
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,997
Enough is enough.
I--

829
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:09,157
I can't wallow in-in
the grief process forever...

830
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,157
and--

831
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:18,553
and I can't keep lying to myself
about who my mom was.

832
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,913
Yeah, I think I'm really...

833
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,516
scared...

834
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:31,791
that I'm gonna turn out
just like her, you know?

835
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:36,350
Like "The Bad Seed"
or somethin'.

836
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,233
And I know--
I know it doesn't make sense.

837
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,277
Yeah, it does.

838
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:49,271
It's like Jodie Foster in
"The Silence of the Lambs"...

839
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:53,109
when she keeps having
flashbacks of her dead father.

840
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:57,119
But this is life.
This isn't a movie.

841
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,515
Sure it is, Sid.

842
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,517
It's all--
It's all a movie.

843
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,517
It's all...

844
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,517
one great big movie.

845
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,955
Only you can't pick
your genre.

846
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,795
Why can't I be
a Meg Ryan movie?

847
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:47,555
Or even a good porno.

848
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,794
- What?
- You heard me.

849
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:04,316
Are you sure?

850
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,471
Yeah.

851
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,319
I think so.

852
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,236
Look, look, look.
Here it comes.

853
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:30,790
Oh, man.
The colour of the blood is all wrong!

854
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,354
Why do they do that?
It's too red!

855
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:36,711
Wait. Here comes another.
Here it-- Here it--

856
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,717
- Ooh!
- Yes! Yes!

857
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,990
Predictable.
I knew he was gonna bite it.

858
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,350
How can you watch this shit
over and over?

859
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,948
When do we see breasts?
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts.

860
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,674
- When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
- Yes. Yes.
- Breasts?

861
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,030
Not until "Trading Places"
in '83.

862
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,435
Jamie Lee was always the virgin
in horror movies.

863
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,676
She never showed her tits
till she went legits.

864
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,837
- Could afford a decent pair.
- What did you--

865
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,713
That's why she always
outsmarted the killer in
the big chase scene at the end.

866
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:04,070
Only virgins can do that.
Don't you know the rules?

867
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,509
- What rules?
- You don--

868
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:11,035
Jesus Christ.
You don't know the rules?

869
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:13,071
Have an aneurysm,
why don't ya?

870
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,714
There are certain rules
that one must abide by...

871
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,195
in order to successfully
survive a horror movie.

872
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,756
For instance, number one:
You can never have sex.

873
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,710
- Big no-no! Big no-no!
- I'd be a dead man.

874
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,717
- Sex equals death. Okay?
- Yes!

875
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,673
Number two:
You can never drink or do drugs.

876
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,311
No, the sin factor.

877
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,635
It's a sin.
It's an extension of number one.

878
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,399
And number three:
Never, ever, ever...

879
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,751
under any circumstances say,
"l'll be right back,"
'cause you won't be back.

880
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:48,474
- I'm gettin' another beer.
You want one?
- Yeah, sure.

881
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,875
I'll be right back!

882
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,835
You see? You push the laws
and you end up dead.

883
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,837
Okay? I'll see you
in the kitchen with a knife.

884
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:00,191
Only virgins can outsmart the killer
in the big chase scene at the end.

885
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,629
- Don't you know the rules?
- What rules?

886
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,149
You don't know the rules?
There are certain rules...

887
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,636
- that one must abide by in order
to essentially survive a horror movie.
- Boring.

888
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:13,629
- For instance--
- The sheriff just radioed.

889
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:17,230
Somebody reported a car
in the bushes down the road.
I'm gonna go check it out.

890
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:20,591
- Would you care to join me?
- I'd love to.

891
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:23,029
If you're sure
it's all right.

892
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,958
Ma'am,
I'm the deputy of this town.

893
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,270
Be right back.

894
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,750
You see, you push the laws
and you end up dead.

895
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,633
- W-- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Mm-hmm?

896
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,637
I thought maybe we'd walk.

897
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:44,437
It's such a nice night out.
I got a flashlight.

898
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:50,756
- You're not scared, are ya?
- No.

899
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,235
- All right.
- Great.

900
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,071
Do you know what
that constellation is?

901
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,191
No. What is it?

902
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,357
I don't know.
That's why I was askin' you.

903
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,479
- What happened to Tatum, Stu?
- She probably got pissed
at me and bailed.

904
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,477
- Bye.
- Bye.

905
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:15,996
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.

906
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,753
Look! Here comes
the obligatory tit shot!

907
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,197
- Yes! Oh! That was beautiful!
- Lovely!

908
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,674
- Oh, my God.
- I'll leave you guys alone.

909
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,637
You are so...

910
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,997
amazing.

911
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:59,478
Hello? Yeah?

912
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,557
Holy shit.

913
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:10,715
N-- Ho--
Listen up.

914
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:13,593
They found
Principal Himbry dead.

915
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:16,439
He was gutted and hung from
the goalpost on the football field.

916
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,633
- So what are we waiting for?
- Let's go over there
before they pry him down.

917
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:23,832
- Hey. Hey.
- To arms! To arms!

918
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:26,713
- Where did he say he was?
- Where are you guys--
Where are you guys--
- At the football field!

919
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:31,038
- Come on!
- Where you guys goin'?

920
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,230
We were just gettin'
to the good part.

921
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,636
Hello? Yeah?

922
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:46,150
Where are you guys--

923
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:01,712
Heigh-ho, Silver!
Let's go!

924
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,913
- So, is-- is Dewey your real name?
- No, it's Dwight.

925
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,473
Dwight?

926
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,068
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's all right.

927
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:13,749
Dewey's just somethin'
I got stuck with a long time ago.

928
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:15,757
Well, I like it.

929
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:18,075
It's sexy.

930
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,714
- Sexy?
- Mm-hmm.

931
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:24,071
Ah, it's just this town's way
of not takin' me serious.

932
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:26,475
What about Gale Weathers?

933
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:29,512
Sounds like I'm
a meteorologist or something.

934
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:35,715
People treat me like I'm the antichrist
of television journalism.

935
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:38,195
- I don't think you're that bad.
- No?
- No.

936
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,675
I think that's just 'cause
you kinda like me.

937
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,394
They sure are comin' fast.
Slow down!

938
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,397
Freeze! Jump!

939
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:52,749
- I'm sorry. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

940
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:06,635
I'm sorry.
I'm on duty.

941
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,795
Is that what
you're looking for?

942
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,797
My whole life.

943
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,869
- Damn!
- What?

944
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,877
- What is it?
- This is Neil Prescott's car.

945
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,070
- Sidney's father?
- Yeah.

946
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,437
Jesus.
What's he doing here?

947
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,917
We gotta get back.

948
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,237
You okay?

949
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:46,557
Yeah.

950
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,557
Yeah, I'm fine.

951
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:02,229
- Who'd you call?
- What?

952
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:05,830
Well, I don't know. When you're arrested
you're allowed one phone call.

953
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,428
So I was just curious.
Who'd you call?

954
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,277
Called my dad.

955
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:17,710
No, um, Sheriff Burke
called your dad. I saw him.

956
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,676
Yeah, but when I called
I didn't get an answer.

957
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:37,318
You don't still think
it was me, do you?

958
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:43,359
No.

959
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:45,516
No. I was just thinking...

960
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:49,189
if it were you it'd be a very
clever way to throw me off track.

961
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:54,997
You know, using your one phone call
to call me so that I wouldn't
think it was you, that's all.

962
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,111
Really.

963
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:07,992
What do I have to do to prove
to you that I'm not a killer?

964
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:11,994
- Oh, my God.
- Huh?

965
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:16,393
- Oh, my God.
- Sidney--
- Billy, watch out!

966
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,430
Sid.
