Don't anybody move orbreathe unless I tell you to.

Let's go.

44
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:41,046
Thank you.

45
00:03:41,177 --> 00:03:42,222
AIRPORT ANNOUNCEMENT: Flight 181is now departing from Gate 8.

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,599
Ugh.

Your drink.

Wait till you see this place.

Hey, I got your present.

59
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,916
It's great, except I
have to hit it a million

60
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:08,873
times before it lights.

61
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:11,049
Well, it's an antique.

62
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,008
Um, so did you
like the engraving?

63
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:14,662
Kind of sappy.

64
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:16,141
Yeah, but deep
down inside, you

65
00:05:16,272 --> 00:05:17,621
know you like the sappiness.

66
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:19,057
Among other things.

67
00:05:19,188 --> 00:05:20,929
So what, uh, what
flight are you working?

68
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:22,496
Ugh, 211.

69
00:05:22,626 --> 00:05:24,585
Oh, party plane to
the Mexican coast, huh?

70
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:27,283
Don't even go there.

71
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:30,634
Look, I'm really lookingforward to this weekend.

72
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:33,898
I hope we can-- we can
work everything out.

73
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:35,813
I hope so.

74
00:05:35,944 --> 00:05:36,771
I love you.

75
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:41,732

77
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:45,432
Bye.

78
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:53,875
It looks like
it's going to rain.

79
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:55,398
I hate rain.

80
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:56,356
Come on.

81
00:05:56,486 --> 00:05:57,357
Let's go.

82
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,273
Oh, god.

83
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:02,840
Are you OK?

84
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:03,841
Yeah.

85
00:06:03,972 --> 00:06:05,539
Yeah, I think I'll be OK.

86
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:07,279
Hang on just a second.

87
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,152
The stewardess
who's afraid to fly.

88
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:47,929
Hey.

89
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:49,713
Can I help you?

90
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:50,888
There should four electronictickets under Dirty Shames.

91
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:51,802
OK.

92
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:55,806
You're going to have to
check all those bags.

93
00:06:55,937 --> 00:06:56,981
Those are too big for carry-on.

94
00:06:57,112 --> 00:06:58,722
That'll be wonderful.

95
00:06:58,853 --> 00:06:59,723
Thanks.

96
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:00,594
Mhm.

97
00:07:06,904 --> 00:07:07,905
You care for my bag, right?

98
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:08,863
I got it.

99
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:40,634

your refreshments.

00:07:56,693 --> 00:07:57,868
I like Zach.

110
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:58,782

111
00:07:58,913 --> 00:08:00,218

00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:01,611
Well, we're going to
give it another shot.

113
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:03,047
Well, good.

114
00:08:03,178 --> 00:08:05,093
Now, when you get down
there, do something new.

115
00:08:05,223 --> 00:08:07,835
Maybe go scuba diving--

116
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:09,010
beautiful reefs.

117
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,533
The wife and I do
it all the time.

118
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:12,796
Some excitement into
the relationship.

119
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:21,022
PASSENGER: Whoohoo!

120
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:23,024

127
00:08:35,863 --> 00:08:36,777

148
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:09,723
Anyone.

149
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:10,637

Whoohoohoo!

158
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,219
Why do I get the
feeling this is going

159
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,569
to be one of those flights?

160
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:32,223

No, it's not a problem.

180

It's their job.

Is that all right?

Yeah, this'll do just fine.

Um, no.

200
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,188
We don't-- we
don't have anything

201
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:08,537
like that on the plane.
- That's OK.

202
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,451
Hey.

207
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:59,153
It's all right, everyone.

208
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:01,024
This is absolutely normal.

209
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:03,113
Everything's fine.

210
00:12:03,244 --> 00:12:04,071

Yeah.

219
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:29,400

I guess you're aware

220
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:32,316
that it's a federaloffense with a $3,000 fine.

221

222
00:12:34,231 --> 00:12:36,146

You're making me think
about doing some things.

230
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:55,122
Get off me!

231
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,047
Huh?

232
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:10,006

00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:54,847
I need the embassy.

559
00:27:54,977 --> 00:27:56,413
Where's the American embassy?

560
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,894
Senor, control yourself.

561
00:27:59,025 --> 00:28:00,853
We are doing everything we can.

562
00:28:00,983 --> 00:28:02,855
You don't fucking
get it, do you?

563
00:28:02,985 --> 00:28:05,814
My girlfriend is on that
plane, and it crashed.

564
00:28:05,945 --> 00:28:06,728
Gentlemen.

565
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:13,909
The American embassy is500 miles away, compadre.

566
00:28:17,478 --> 00:28:18,827
See ya later, Rosa.

567
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:30,709
How do I get to
the American embassy?

568
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:33,712
You don't want the
American embassy, kid.

569
00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:38,281
You don't want all that redtape and foreign bullshit.

570
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:39,500
What you want is a tracker.

571
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,328
You know what a tracker is.

572
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:46,420
A tracker's a-- someone
finds lost things.

573
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,726
All right, you know
somebody like that?

574
00:29:04,264 --> 00:29:05,569
MAX: Let's go.
Let's go.

575
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,570
All right, we're going.

576
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:07,484
We're going.

577
00:29:07,615 --> 00:29:08,572
SOL: Let's move it.

578
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,534
Hey.

579
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:15,710
Hey!
- Move it.

580
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:18,582
Set it down right over there.

581
00:29:18,713 --> 00:29:19,540
Move it.

582
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,933
What's in here, concrete?

583
00:29:21,063 --> 00:29:21,934
Get over there.

584
00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:25,372
Hey, keep moving, fuck.

585
00:29:25,502 --> 00:29:28,810
Fuckin' ass.

586
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:31,247
MAX: Hurry it up.

587
00:29:31,378 --> 00:29:34,163
Sol, there's three
more in there.

588
00:29:34,294 --> 00:29:35,469
Yeah, I know, man.

589
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:36,426
That's all we could get, man.

590
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:40,474
Oh my god!

591
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:41,388
Jerry!

592
00:29:41,518 --> 00:29:42,389
Oh my god!

593
00:29:52,051 --> 00:29:52,791
No!

594
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,082
Geez.

595
00:30:29,175 --> 00:30:33,483
Well, bad motherfuckers.

596
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:35,398
All right, get in there,and check that shit out.

597
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:36,530
What?

598
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,444
Yeah.

599
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:52,459
You, Squid, man,
check this out, man.

600
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:54,200
We-- we tore its ass up.

601
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,158
, man.

602
00:30:56,289 --> 00:30:57,333
Enough.

603
00:30:57,464 --> 00:30:58,247
Sol.

604
00:30:58,378 --> 00:30:59,248
Yo, here.

605
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:03,731
A little trophy for you, baby.

606
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,386
All right, all right, enough.

607
00:31:06,516 --> 00:31:10,781
Now here is where the
real adventure begins.

608
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:12,261
Move it out.

609
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,788
Let's go.
Let's go.

610
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:18,702
Pick it up.

611
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:19,616
Let's go.

612
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:20,704
You, get a case.

613
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:31,106
You,  pick it up.

614
00:31:31,237 --> 00:31:32,107
Take care of it.

615
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:33,543
, wake up.

616
00:31:34,675 --> 00:31:35,632
Wake up.

617
00:31:35,763 --> 00:31:41,464
Who the fuck are you?

618
00:31:41,595 --> 00:31:43,118
I'm Zach Fowler.

619
00:31:43,249 --> 00:31:46,513
I'm sorry, I, uh, I justdrank too much, all right?

620
00:31:46,643 --> 00:31:47,731
ZACH: Yeah, I could tell.

621
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:49,864
Yeah.

622
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:51,953
Hey, wait.

623
00:31:52,084 --> 00:31:54,390
Wait.

624
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:55,696
I remember you now.

625
00:31:55,826 --> 00:31:58,133
You're the kid from
the ..

626
00:31:58,264 --> 00:31:59,830
Yeah.

627
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:02,181
And you're supposed to bethe best tracker around, huh?

628
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:04,661
What did you
expect, Lancelot, hm?

629
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:05,575
Jesus.

630
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:08,317
Wait, wait, wait.

631
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:13,540
Hey, kid, you don't want
to go to a plane crash.

632
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,063
Yes, I do.

633
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:16,195
Look, if there's a chanceof her being alive,

634
00:32:16,325 --> 00:32:17,718
then I want to find it.
OK?

635
00:32:17,848 --> 00:32:20,547
Yeah, well, you knowwhat people look like when

636
00:32:20,677 --> 00:32:22,549
you find them in a plane crash?

637
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:24,377
Do you want the job or not?

638
00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:26,466
Things like this don't come--

639
00:32:26,596 --> 00:32:27,771
they're expensive.

640
00:32:27,902 --> 00:32:29,121
Money is not a problem, OK?

641
00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:30,035
I got money.

642
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:30,949
You see?

643
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:32,211
Huh?

644
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:35,214
That's not enough
to buy breakfast.

645
00:32:35,344 --> 00:32:37,738
Yeah, well, her
parents are loaded too.

646
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:39,000
OK?

647
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:42,177
Her dad started an
internet company.

648
00:32:42,308 --> 00:32:43,831
You know, internet.

649
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,267
Look, anyway, they're
filthy rich, OK?

650
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:46,790
It doesn't matter.

651
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:49,445
She flies around the worldoff of her trust fund.

652
00:32:49,576 --> 00:32:50,925
All right.

653
00:32:51,056 --> 00:32:54,320
This is-- this my
minimum offer--

654
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,322
$3,000.

655
00:32:56,452 --> 00:33:00,456
You pay for everything, andI get to keep what I find.

656
00:33:00,587 --> 00:33:03,111
Fine.
You got it.

657
00:33:03,242 --> 00:33:06,767
Listen, kid, I'll
tell you one thing.

658
00:33:06,897 --> 00:33:09,117
We've got to do this in ahurry, because if they went down

659
00:33:09,248 --> 00:33:11,076
in the swamp where I
think they went down,

660
00:33:11,206 --> 00:33:13,121
not too many people
make it out alive, OK?

661
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:13,992
OK.

662
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:26,787
MAX: Lights!
JULIE: OK.

663
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:27,831
OK.

664
00:33:27,962 --> 00:33:29,137
MAX: Give me the fucking light.

665
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:38,277
This water smells like ass.

666
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:40,061
That's methane.

667
00:33:40,192 --> 00:33:44,196
It's the number one cause ofwildfires in swampy areas.

668
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:45,458
If you light that
up, it goes boom.

669
00:33:45,588 --> 00:33:47,199
Ugh!

670
00:33:47,329 --> 00:33:48,113
Leave him alone.

671
00:33:48,243 --> 00:33:49,462
He's in shock!

672
00:33:49,592 --> 00:33:51,116
That boy's brain is mush.

673
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:51,986
What?

674
00:33:56,817 --> 00:34:01,213
Hey, he's right.

675
00:34:01,343 --> 00:34:03,215
It works.

676
00:34:03,345 --> 00:34:04,868
This ain't some male
bonding camping trip.

677
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:06,261
Now, move.

678
00:34:06,392 --> 00:34:07,306
Hey, we're carrying
this stuff, aren't we?

679
00:34:07,436 --> 00:34:08,133
Shh.

680
00:34:11,223 --> 00:34:12,920
Sol?
SOL: Yo?

681
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,139
You wanna take care of this.

682
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:15,053
Yup.

683
00:34:15,183 --> 00:34:16,489
No, no, no, no.

684
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:17,794
No, don't.

685
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:19,057
Please-- please don't kill me.God, no.

686
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:21,450
You're gonna
carry the luggage,

687
00:34:21,581 --> 00:34:22,190
and you're not gonna
complain, right?

688
00:34:22,321 --> 00:34:22,843
Yes.
What?

689
00:34:22,973 --> 00:34:23,322
Yes.
Yes.

690
00:34:23,452 --> 00:34:24,149
Yes.

691
00:34:24,279 --> 00:34:25,454
Yes.
Carry it.

692
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:26,847
I'll carry it.
I'll carry it.

693
00:34:26,977 --> 00:34:27,761
No problem.

694
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:32,331
Give me a nail, kid.

695
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,293
MAX: Light, dammit.

696
00:34:38,424 --> 00:34:39,164
Fuck.

697
00:34:47,694 --> 00:34:49,783
I can smoke now, right?

698
00:34:49,913 --> 00:34:50,784
Sure.

699
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:52,264
That's what I thought.

700
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,632
JULIE: The black box?

701
00:35:12,762 --> 00:35:13,937
Where did you get it?

702
00:35:14,068 --> 00:35:15,635
MIA: Jerry pulled
it from the cockpit.

703
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:16,984
So this is a black box?

704
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:17,898
This is it?

705
00:35:18,028 --> 00:35:18,812
Keep it down.

706
00:35:21,684 --> 00:35:23,773
So this thing,
it can track us?

707
00:35:23,904 --> 00:35:25,123
MIA: Yeah.

708
00:35:25,253 --> 00:35:26,341
They probably found
the plane already.

709
00:35:26,472 --> 00:35:29,257
And they're on their way.

710
00:35:29,388 --> 00:35:31,216
No.

711
00:35:31,346 --> 00:35:32,869
They wouldn't have beenable to launch a full search

712
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,915
until this weather cleared.

713
00:35:35,045 --> 00:35:36,438
And then when they
find the plane,

714
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:38,223
they'll dredge the wateraround the crash site first.

715
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:40,399
And then, they'll
expand the search.

716
00:35:40,529 --> 00:35:42,096
It's going to take themsome time to even figure out

717
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:43,010
we're missing.

718
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,838
Great.

719
00:35:44,968 --> 00:35:45,795
Fuck me.

720
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,153
What?

721
00:35:55,283 --> 00:35:57,329
Was there ever a better time?

722
00:35:57,459 --> 00:35:58,504
Let me see this.

723
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:00,854
Mm, I'm gonna
be needing those.

724
00:36:00,984 --> 00:36:02,812
Hey, is that alcohol?

725
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:03,770
Give it to me.

726
00:36:09,384 --> 00:36:11,865
JUSTIN: Wait, you, reallyshouldn't mix those.

727
00:36:11,995 --> 00:36:14,302
You're not do what
I think you're doing.

728
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:16,217
Yeah, I am.

729
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:18,567
What do you-- what do
you think she's doing?

730
00:36:18,698 --> 00:36:19,873
Well, you can't use them all.

731
00:36:20,003 --> 00:36:21,004
I'm going to need at least five.

732
00:36:21,135 --> 00:36:22,005
Well, there's not enough.

733
00:36:22,136 --> 00:36:22,919
You can have two.

734
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,399
Three.

735
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,444
Oh.

736
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:26,314
Oh, no, no, no.

737
00:36:26,445 --> 00:36:27,359
You can't do that.

738
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:28,664
They'll kill us.

739
00:36:28,795 --> 00:36:30,623
They're not going
to kill us anyway?

740
00:36:30,753 --> 00:36:32,625
Oh, no, no, no.

741
00:36:32,755 --> 00:36:33,626
I don't want any part of this.

742
00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:35,541
You can count me out, OK?

743
00:36:35,671 --> 00:36:37,499
Forget it.

744
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,022
It's better to
die on your feet

745
00:36:39,153 --> 00:36:40,110
than to live on your knees.

Hmph.

I don't mind living on my knees.MAX: Sol, you--

--you tie them up.

752
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:51,470
Mhm.

Aw, man, I'm wasted, Max.

MAX: Can it.

757
00:36:56,736 --> 00:36:58,607
You really don't have-- look,we're not going to run away.

758
00:36:58,738 --> 00:37:01,088
I mean, you're in completecontrol of the situation,

Would you like room
service with that?

761
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,018
Ow.

Are you sure you
want to do this?

00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,047
Yes.

766
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:32,658
It won't work.

767
00:38:32,788 --> 00:38:33,572
Shh.

768
00:38:33,702 --> 00:38:34,529
Be quiet.

769
00:38:37,706 --> 00:38:41,057
Be careful.

770
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:53,983
Might as well
go back to sleep.

771
00:38:54,114 --> 00:38:55,681
We're not going to be
moving for a while.

772
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:59,162
I can't sleep.

773
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:02,601
Can't I just come keepyou company for a minute?

774
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:07,127
Hm.

775
00:39:07,257 --> 00:39:09,651
Shh.

Go ahead, my front pocket.

Go ahead.

779

Where'd you get that?

780
00:39:34,197 --> 00:39:37,157
The plane.

781
00:39:37,287 --> 00:39:38,767
Come on, untie me, and
we'll have a nightcap.

782

So you think
we're almost there?

Oh, god I hope so, because Ican't stand this fucking place.

787
00:40:36,129 --> 00:40:38,566
I hear you.

788
00:40:38,697 --> 00:40:43,484
Reminds of when my parentsused to take me camping.

789
00:40:43,615 --> 00:40:46,182
Hated that too.

790
00:40:46,313 --> 00:40:49,011
Down.

791

They so fucking heavy.

You can tell me.

800
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:19,389
Well, it's a long story.

801
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,175
You got a little time?

802
00:41:22,305 --> 00:41:25,570
A little time.

803
00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:32,925
First thing you have to--

804
00:41:36,842 --> 00:41:39,975
have to understand
is that all vault

Oh, yeah.

808

They're always trying to--

809
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,870
always trying to beef
them up with high-speed

810
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,093
chips and infraredlocks, new lines of code.

811
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:29,242
And I'm saying this with allhonesty, I'm the best there is.

812
00:42:29,372 --> 00:42:30,243
Wow.

813
00:42:35,857 --> 00:42:39,731
And my name is Jack.

814
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:40,732

815
00:42:40,862 --> 00:42:41,602
Uh-huh.

816
00:42:53,353 --> 00:42:54,789
Just knock them down.

817
00:42:59,968 --> 00:43:01,622
I mean, that's really
all there is to it.

818
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:08,803
It's more technical
than that, you know.

819
00:43:08,934 --> 00:43:10,152
Yeah.

820
00:43:10,283 --> 00:43:16,463
You do understand
what I'm saying, yeah?

821
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,378
Of course.

822
00:43:18,508 --> 00:43:19,988
Well, you say it
with me now, then.

823
00:43:22,991 --> 00:43:24,732
You just--

824
00:43:24,863 --> 00:43:25,733
- Knock them--
- --up.

825
00:43:25,864 --> 00:43:26,691
--up.

826
00:43:26,821 --> 00:43:29,084
BOTH: --to set them down.

827
00:43:37,919 --> 00:43:39,138
You're a smart girl.

Sleepy.

829
00:43:50,236 --> 00:43:52,107

Shit.

00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,013
Get up.

838
00:45:12,144 --> 00:45:15,495
I got them.

839
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:21,893
What the-- wake
up, motherfucker.

840
00:45:22,023 --> 00:45:23,242
Where are they?

841
00:45:23,372 --> 00:45:24,243
Where are they?

842
00:45:24,373 --> 00:45:25,679
- Ugh.

843
00:45:26,767 --> 00:45:27,725
Where the fuck is your gun?

844
00:45:27,855 --> 00:45:28,726
I don't know.

845
00:45:28,856 --> 00:45:29,596
Where the fuck is your gun?

846
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,858
I don't know!

847
00:45:30,989 --> 00:45:32,033
I'll tell you
something, motherfucker.

848
00:45:32,164 --> 00:45:33,339
You better hope
that I find them.

849
00:45:33,469 --> 00:45:34,296
Ugh.

850

All right.

863

I told you this
was a bad idea.

864

930
00:48:34,215 --> 00:48:35,042
It was my idea.
It was my idea!

931
00:48:35,173 --> 00:48:35,869
Don't listen to her, Max.

932
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,739
She's a lying bitch.

933
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:37,697
No, that's not true.

934
00:48:37,827 --> 00:48:39,003
I convinced them to do it.

935
00:48:39,133 --> 00:48:42,267
Oh, shut up, bitch!

936
00:48:42,397 --> 00:48:44,399
MAX: You better be
motherfucking right.

937
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:45,923
Consider this a stay
of execution, bitch.

938
00:48:48,534 --> 00:48:49,404
- Ah!
- Go on.

939
00:48:49,535 --> 00:48:50,275
All right.

940
00:48:50,405 --> 00:48:51,276
Go on.

941
00:48:51,406 --> 00:48:52,277
I'll kill your fucking ass.

942
00:48:52,407 --> 00:48:53,191
Come on.

943
00:48:53,321 --> 00:48:54,148
Come on.

944
00:48:54,279 --> 00:48:55,106
Go!

945
00:48:55,236 --> 00:48:56,063
Let's go.

946
00:48:56,194 --> 00:48:57,499
Pick it up, double-time.

947
00:49:12,645 --> 00:49:14,995
So this thing can
pick up a black box

948
00:49:15,126 --> 00:49:16,431
signal from way up here?

949
00:49:16,562 --> 00:49:17,911
No problem.

950
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:19,826
Good tracking device is
a pilot's best friend.

951
00:49:23,003 --> 00:49:26,050
You know, back in '78, I hadto use a tracking device.

952
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,573
I had to get myself a--

953
00:49:27,703 --> 00:49:28,835
what was that tracking?

954
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:32,795
A one-- a single-engine
FlySpotter.

955
00:49:32,926 --> 00:49:35,363
Found out it was sunk
10 feet in the mud.

956
00:49:35,494 --> 00:49:37,626
And that baby found it.

957
00:49:37,757 --> 00:49:40,107
The salvage on that one
was something special.

958
00:49:40,238 --> 00:49:42,936
I must have cleared about$4,500 and didn't get a--

959
00:49:43,067 --> 00:49:44,503
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

960
00:49:44,633 --> 00:49:46,461
Look, if I'm paying
for this, we've

961
00:49:46,592 --> 00:49:48,420
got to set some ground
rules right now, OK?

962
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,596
I don't want to hear any
more talk about salvage.

963
00:49:50,726 --> 00:49:52,380
We're looking for people.

964
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:54,121
You got it?

965
00:49:54,252 --> 00:49:54,992
Sorry.

966
00:50:24,543 --> 00:50:28,025
How much farther we got, Max?

967
00:50:28,155 --> 00:50:29,678
Acapulco's southwest
of here, man.

968
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:32,507
We're head the wrong way.

969
00:50:32,638 --> 00:50:33,900
I think we should
listen to him.

970
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,510
I think he knows what
he's talking about.

971
00:50:35,641 --> 00:50:37,077
Yeah, I don't know if thekid knows what the fuck he's

972
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:37,860
talking about, but weshould get to higher ground,

973
00:50:37,991 --> 00:50:39,123
because this water--

974
00:50:39,253 --> 00:50:40,820
Will you shut the
fuck up for once?

975
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:43,736
Listen, I'm really tryingto hold it together here, OK,

976
00:50:43,866 --> 00:50:44,911
but there's a fucking--
MIA: Justin!

977
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:45,520
- --in the water.
- Be quiet!

978
00:50:48,784 --> 00:50:51,222
Now, my only concern, whichshould be your only concern,

979
00:50:51,352 --> 00:50:53,833
is getting these objects
from point A to point B.

980
00:50:53,963 --> 00:50:55,704
Yeah, OK, Max, but we'vebeen out here for a fucking--

981
00:50:55,835 --> 00:50:56,923
There's just a fucking
thing in the water--

982
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,272
I think if we
just turned around,

983
00:50:58,403 --> 00:50:59,621
we might be headed in
the right direction.

984
00:50:59,752 --> 00:51:00,970
--that's gonna eat us.
Do you understand?

985
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:02,711
It wants to eat us.
- Shut the fuck up!

986
00:51:02,842 --> 00:51:04,887
Now, I'm tired of hearing aboutthis motherfucking crocodile.

987
00:51:05,018 --> 00:51:09,892
Take my shit to the end of theline, and I might let you live.

988
00:51:10,023 --> 00:51:11,633
Else, there's gonna be
a trail of dead bodies.

989
00:51:11,764 --> 00:51:13,374
I'm telling you, man.I can get us out of here.

990
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:20,555
Why don't you
lead us, boy wonder?

991
00:51:20,686 --> 00:51:22,644
But I'm gonna tell
you something--

992
00:51:22,775 --> 00:51:23,863
you mislead us one time--

993
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:28,781
That's fine.

994
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:37,137
MAX: Motherfucker!

995
00:51:37,268 --> 00:51:38,704
We know.

996
00:51:38,834 --> 00:51:39,792
We've been telling you therewas a big croc after us.

997
00:51:39,922 --> 00:51:40,793
You didn't listen.

998
00:51:40,923 --> 00:51:42,664
We should go back, Max.

999
00:51:42,795 --> 00:51:44,013
We should go back.

1000
00:51:44,144 --> 00:51:45,841
I agree with him.
We should go back.

1001
00:51:45,972 --> 00:51:46,929
Don't go fucking
taking my side.

1002
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,496
Max, this isn't right.

1003
00:51:48,627 --> 00:51:50,716
You said it was
gonna be an easy job.

1004
00:51:50,846 --> 00:51:52,500
You said we were going tofly to our rendezvous point,

1005
00:51:52,631 --> 00:51:54,241
not march through afucking jungle ..

1006
00:51:54,372 --> 00:51:55,242
We've got a lawyer.

1007
00:51:55,373 --> 00:51:56,635
We've got a fucking savant.

1008
00:51:56,765 --> 00:51:57,766
We've got a fucking slut.- Squid.

1009
00:51:57,897 --> 00:51:59,290
And I am not losing my life.

1010
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,553
Motherfucker, you betterpull it together now.

1011
00:52:01,683 --> 00:52:03,163
I have enough to worry
about with these fucking

1012
00:52:03,294 --> 00:52:05,339
motherfuckers but not you.I cannot lose you.

1013
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:06,601
You hear me, motherfucker?

1014
00:52:06,732 --> 00:52:08,299
Because I can guarantee
you one thing.

1015
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:09,561
You keep this shit up, youwill not make it out of here.

1016
00:52:09,691 --> 00:52:10,518
I'll see to it myself.

1017
00:52:23,052 --> 00:52:29,146
There it is, kid, El PantanoDiablo, the devil's swamp,

1018
00:52:29,276 --> 00:52:32,888
a swamp bigger than
the Everglades.

1019
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:37,197
The natives, they call it asunken world where monsters

1020
00:52:37,328 --> 00:52:39,721
live that could
tear out your soul,

1021
00:52:39,852 --> 00:52:42,681
send you straight
to the underworld.

1022
00:52:45,249 --> 00:52:47,555
ZACH: What's that?

1023
00:52:47,686 --> 00:52:49,601
ROLAND: : Aha, there she is.

1024
00:52:49,731 --> 00:52:52,256
Just sit tight, kid.

1025
00:52:52,386 --> 00:52:56,260
We'll be there in a minute.

1026
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:58,653
We're gonna do the rest ofthis search on the ground, kid.

1027
00:53:05,747 --> 00:53:07,140
ZACH: There's nothing here.

1028
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:09,142
ROLAND: : Oh, I've got
boats stashed here.

1029
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:11,579
We'll go up river
north by northwest,

1030
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:13,494
take us right to the scene.

1031
00:53:20,632 --> 00:53:25,376
Well, this is it, kid.

1032
00:53:31,033 --> 00:53:32,383
What is this place?

1033
00:53:32,513 --> 00:53:33,949
Where I've got alittle bit of everything.

1034
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,822
I don't think I want to know.

1035
00:53:36,952 --> 00:53:39,781
Come on, kid.

1036
00:53:39,912 --> 00:53:43,263
Home sweet home, boy.

1037
00:53:43,394 --> 00:53:45,526
Here, pull this thing out.

1038
00:53:45,657 --> 00:53:47,528
I'm sure you can assemble it.

1039
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:49,617
Come on,
just pull it out.

1040
00:53:49,748 --> 00:53:50,488
All right.

1041
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,413
SOL: No fucking way.

1042
00:54:02,543 --> 00:54:03,936
Ugh.

1043
00:54:04,066 --> 00:54:05,851
Man, this is not a good idea.

1044
00:54:09,942 --> 00:54:10,812
Get up.

1045
00:54:14,555 --> 00:54:15,252
Move!

1046
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,268
This doesn't make any sense.

1047
00:54:31,398 --> 00:54:32,269
What?

1048
00:54:32,399 --> 00:54:36,185
What doesn't make any sense?

1049
00:54:36,316 --> 00:54:44,019
According to this, we shouldbe standing right on top of it.

1050
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:46,979
Mia!

1051
00:54:47,109 --> 00:54:48,502
Mia!

1052
00:54:48,633 --> 00:54:52,376
Where the hell is it?

1053
00:55:00,906 --> 00:55:01,776
Oh my god.

1054
00:55:01,907 --> 00:55:02,647
Ah!

1055
00:55:06,346 --> 00:55:09,044
ROLAND: : Don't move.

1056
00:55:09,175 --> 00:55:10,524
Don't move a goddamn muscle.

1057
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:12,526
No.

1058
00:55:12,657 --> 00:55:14,441
Stay real still, kid.

1059
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:18,445
Don't move.

1060
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:28,934
Move!

1061
00:55:29,064 --> 00:55:30,936
Move!

1062
00:55:31,066 --> 00:55:33,504
turn to the left,and I'll meet you at the boat.

1063
00:55:33,634 --> 00:55:34,418
All right.

1064
00:55:37,551 --> 00:55:39,858
ROLAND:

1065
00:55:39,988 --> 00:55:42,861
ZACH: Roland!

1066
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:06,275
Roland!

1067
00:56:06,406 --> 00:56:08,756
Roland!

1068
00:56:11,411 --> 00:56:12,238
Flight recorder.

1069
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,108
Ah!

1070
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:14,022
What the hell?

1071
00:56:14,153 --> 00:56:15,763
Come on.

1072
00:56:15,894 --> 00:56:16,764
What the hell was that?

1073
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,939
Just come on.

1074
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:19,724
It ate the plane's
flight recorder.

1075
00:56:23,336 --> 00:56:24,816
It ate the what?

1076
00:56:24,946 --> 00:56:26,600
It ate the plane's
flight recorder.

1077
00:56:26,731 --> 00:56:27,906
We haven't been
tracking the plane.

1078
00:56:28,036 --> 00:56:29,211
We've been tracking it.

1079
00:56:29,342 --> 00:56:30,909
Where the fuck is it going?

1080
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:32,171
It's going to close in on us.

1081
00:56:32,301 --> 00:56:33,085
You steer.

1082
00:56:33,215 --> 00:56:33,955
Come on!

1083
00:56:34,086 --> 00:56:35,043
Come on!

1084
00:56:35,174 --> 00:56:36,567
Well, move!

1085
00:57:02,549 --> 00:57:03,942
Get them in the water.

1086
00:57:04,072 --> 00:57:04,856
No one say a word.

1087
00:57:04,986 --> 00:57:05,813
Go!

1088
00:57:34,363 --> 00:57:35,190
Oh my god.

1089
00:57:35,321 --> 00:57:36,191
Mia!

1090
00:57:36,322 --> 00:57:37,105
Mia!

1091
00:57:39,847 --> 00:57:43,155
MIA: No, Zach!

1092
00:57:43,285 --> 00:57:44,156
Don't move.

1093
00:57:44,286 --> 00:57:45,679
Don't you fucking move!

1094
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:46,724
MIA: Don't, Zach!

1095
00:57:46,854 --> 00:57:47,899
Don't.

1096
00:57:48,029 --> 00:57:50,075
MAX: Where's the other one?

1097
00:57:51,685 --> 00:57:53,513
All right,
everybody stay still.

1098
00:57:53,644 --> 00:57:55,472
Boy, you better
put that gun down.

1099
00:57:55,602 --> 00:57:57,561
Look, one step at a time, OK?

1100
00:57:57,691 --> 00:57:59,301
This doesn't have
to end tragic, OK?

1101
00:57:59,432 --> 00:58:00,825
Shut the fuck up.

1102
00:58:00,955 --> 00:58:03,436
Look, I don't have a
problem with you guys.

1103
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:04,916
But you are trespassing
in my swamp.

1104
00:58:05,046 --> 00:58:06,831
What the fuck do you want?

1105
00:58:06,961 --> 00:58:08,702
Her.

1106
00:58:08,833 --> 00:58:10,487
SOL: Boy, I'm
gonna say it again.

1107
00:58:10,617 --> 00:58:12,489
Put that gun down before I getready to skull fuck this boy.

1108
00:58:12,619 --> 00:58:13,925
SQUID: Kill him, Sol.
- No!

1109
00:58:14,055 --> 00:58:14,882
SOL: Get back!

1110
00:58:17,406 --> 00:58:19,496
Anybody gets hurt,
then you guys are never

1111
00:58:19,626 --> 00:58:23,587
going to get out of here alive.

1112
00:58:23,717 --> 00:58:26,546
I've got a jumper.

1113
00:58:26,677 --> 00:58:27,939
Yeah?

1114
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:28,853
Where is it?

1115
00:58:28,983 --> 00:58:29,767
Two clicks east.

1116
00:58:29,897 --> 00:58:31,159
He's telling the truth.

1117
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:32,465
If I find out you're
lying, motherfucker.

1118
00:58:32,596 --> 00:58:34,815
Cut your bullshit, OK?

1119
00:58:34,946 --> 00:58:37,775
I'm your only ticket out
of here, like it or not.

1120
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:45,260
Squid!

1121
00:59:03,365 --> 00:59:04,758
Everybody, make it!

1122
00:59:04,889 --> 00:59:06,760
Make it to the shack!

1123
00:59:08,893 --> 00:59:09,720
Come on, come on.

1124
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:11,722
Come on!

1125
00:59:15,334 --> 00:59:16,204
Fucker.

1126
00:59:27,302 --> 00:59:28,086
Over here.

1127
00:59:28,216 --> 00:59:29,174
Here.

1128
00:59:29,304 --> 00:59:30,697
How do we get in?

1129
00:59:30,828 --> 00:59:32,699
door.

1130
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:34,179
Come on, Mia.

1131
00:59:37,835 --> 00:59:38,662
Let's go!

1132
00:59:41,795 --> 00:59:43,144
Try the window!

1133
00:59:43,275 --> 00:59:44,755
Go!

1134
00:59:44,885 --> 00:59:45,669
Go!

1135
00:59:45,799 --> 00:59:46,583
Go!

1136
01:00:05,776 --> 01:00:08,082
I got you.

1137
01:00:08,213 --> 01:00:09,606
Come here.

1138
01:00:10,737 --> 01:00:12,609
Mia.

1139
01:00:16,221 --> 01:00:17,614
Hey, come on!

1140
01:00:17,744 --> 01:00:20,138
What are you waiting for?

1141
01:00:20,268 --> 01:00:23,097
How did you find me?

1142
01:00:23,228 --> 01:00:24,055
How did you know?

1143
01:00:38,199 --> 01:00:39,548
No, you don't.

1144
01:00:43,161 --> 01:00:44,031
Get back.

1145
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:52,997
Go, .

1146
01:00:53,127 --> 01:00:53,998
Go.

1147
01:00:54,128 --> 01:00:54,912
Freeze!

1148
01:01:01,135 --> 01:01:02,006
Help.

1149
01:01:02,136 --> 01:01:03,529
Help!

1150
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,530
Help me!

1151
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:05,531
Help!

1152
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:06,488
Help!

1153
01:01:06,619 --> 01:01:07,489
Fuck!

1154
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:08,969
Help!

1155
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,493
Help me!

1156
01:01:11,624 --> 01:01:14,496
Help!

1157
01:01:14,627 --> 01:01:15,976
Help!

1158
01:01:16,107 --> 01:01:18,500
Help me!

1159
01:01:18,631 --> 01:01:21,939
Go help him.

1160
01:01:22,069 --> 01:01:24,593
Ah!

1161
01:01:24,724 --> 01:01:25,464
All right.

1162
01:01:25,594 --> 01:01:26,465
All right.

1163
01:01:26,595 --> 01:01:28,467
All right.

1164
01:01:28,597 --> 01:01:29,990
It's OK.

1165
01:01:30,121 --> 01:01:30,991
You're all right.

1166
01:01:31,122 --> 01:01:32,471
You're OK.

1167
01:01:32,601 --> 01:01:34,516
Fuck you, you hear me?

1168
01:01:34,647 --> 01:01:37,432
I've got shoes that scare memore than you, motherfucker!

1169
01:01:37,563 --> 01:01:41,001
Eat me!

1170
01:01:45,571 --> 01:01:48,443
MIA:

1171
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:53,753
Sol, get that
stupid motherfucker.

1172
01:01:53,884 --> 01:01:55,015
Fuck off.

1173
01:01:55,146 --> 01:01:56,103
What'd you say?
What'd you freakin' say?

1174
01:01:56,234 --> 01:01:57,148
What the fuck is your problem?

1175
01:02:07,288 --> 01:02:07,811
Step away from
the freaking window.

1176
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:08,725
Step!

1177
01:02:08,855 --> 01:02:10,161
ZACH: I've got you.

1178
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:12,076
Get over there.

1179
01:02:12,206 --> 01:02:13,077
SOL: Let me-- let me check him.

1180
01:02:13,207 --> 01:02:13,947
Yeah.

1181
01:02:16,645 --> 01:02:17,472
SOL: What the fuck is that?

1182
01:02:19,083 --> 01:02:21,955
It's OK.

1183
01:02:22,086 --> 01:02:23,000
MIA:

1184
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:25,263
Take this fucking thing off.

1185
01:02:27,874 --> 01:02:29,093
I'll bust you, motherfucker.

1186
01:02:29,223 --> 01:02:30,529
What's he got?
SOL: He's fucking clean.

1187
01:02:30,659 --> 01:02:31,443
He's got nothing.

1188
01:02:31,573 --> 01:02:32,313
All right.

1189
01:02:32,444 --> 01:02:33,358
All right.

1190
01:02:33,488 --> 01:02:34,272
Move.

01:02:34,402 --> 01:02:35,708
Move.

01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,057
SOL: He's got fucking nothing.

1193
01:02:37,188 --> 01:02:38,276
He's got fucking nothing.I got nothing.

1194
01:02:38,406 --> 01:02:39,712
You've got nothing.
- Told you, man.

1195
01:02:39,843 --> 01:02:40,887
I fucking told you.

1196
01:02:41,018 --> 01:02:42,367
You shut the fuck up!

1197
01:02:42,497 --> 01:02:43,542
You shut the fuck up!

1198
01:02:43,672 --> 01:02:44,456
Shut the fuck up!

1199
01:02:45,979 --> 01:02:48,416
Fucking things is
all fucking bullshit.

1200
01:02:48,547 --> 01:02:50,201
That's all--

1201
01:02:50,331 --> 01:02:51,028
Are you gonna fucking leavekindergarten and come help me?

1202
01:02:51,158 --> 01:02:51,942
SOL: No.

1203
01:02:52,072 --> 01:02:53,378
Come on, man.

1204
01:02:53,508 --> 01:02:56,076
It's the fucking jaws
of death out there, man.

1205
01:02:56,207 --> 01:02:59,036
El diablo.

1206
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:00,515
What?

1207
01:03:00,646 --> 01:03:01,952
It's an old legend.

1208
01:03:08,088 --> 01:03:10,525
Years ago, the conquistadors,they hacked their way

1209
01:03:10,656 --> 01:03:14,486
across the swamp, and they werecarting all the stolen gold

1210
01:03:14,616 --> 01:03:16,357
they got from the Aztecs.

1211
01:03:16,488 --> 01:03:20,100
But only one of
them got out alive.

1212
01:03:20,231 --> 01:03:25,323
He spent his last yearsscreaming about some dragon

1213
01:03:25,453 --> 01:03:29,153
creature that came out ofnowhere, that walked on land

1214
01:03:29,283 --> 01:03:34,811
and walked on the water and
tore them all to pieces.

1215
01:03:34,941 --> 01:03:38,031
He chomped their armor
like it was just paper.

1216
01:03:42,775 --> 01:03:47,562
And when he was done, theswamp was consumed by fire.

1217
01:03:52,437 --> 01:03:55,135
Now, the Spaniards, they hadnever seen anything like this

1218
01:03:55,266 --> 01:03:57,616
before.

1219
01:03:57,746 --> 01:03:58,617
But the natives knew.

1220
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,187
The natives knew what it was.

1221
01:04:05,972 --> 01:04:07,104
They knew it was
the creature that

1222
01:04:07,234 --> 01:04:08,496
guarded the swamp against evil.

1223
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,591
So the natives, to protectthemselves, at night,

1224
01:04:16,722 --> 01:04:24,469
would chant the name, aligartodiablo, aligarto diablo.

1225
01:04:29,996 --> 01:04:32,738
Thank you for that
bit of information.

1226
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:36,568
It was incredibly
helpful and relevant.

1227
01:04:39,658 --> 01:04:42,661
I'm sorry, but, why don'twe just go outside, go bust

1228
01:04:42,791 --> 01:04:45,359
a cap in its ass like
we did the last one?

1229
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:46,839
Your guns aren't
going to stop this one.

1230
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:48,101
Be quiet.
Be quiet.

1231
01:04:48,232 --> 01:04:48,928
Be quiet.

1232
01:04:52,105 --> 01:04:57,328
OK, folks, this is
what we're gonna do.

1233
01:04:57,458 --> 01:05:01,636
You and you are
gonna go out there.

1234
01:05:01,767 --> 01:05:02,811
You're going to
go get that boat.

1235
01:05:02,942 --> 01:05:04,030
You're gonna bring
it back to me.

1236
01:05:04,161 --> 01:05:04,901
No!

1237
01:05:05,031 --> 01:05:05,902
Baby, it's OK.

1238
01:05:06,032 --> 01:05:06,815
MIA: No, please.

1239
01:05:06,946 --> 01:05:08,208
Please.

1240
01:05:08,339 --> 01:05:10,645
Listen, it's getting dark.

1241
01:05:10,776 --> 01:05:12,212
I mean, why don't I go?

1242
01:05:12,343 --> 01:05:15,607
I mean, I know the area.

1243
01:05:15,737 --> 01:05:18,131
That's actually
a really good idea.

1244
01:05:18,262 --> 01:05:19,567
That way when you leave
here, you can just

1245
01:05:19,698 --> 01:05:20,960
take off and not come back.

1246
01:05:21,091 --> 01:05:26,052
You must really
think I'm an idiot.

1247
01:05:26,183 --> 01:05:27,488
No.

1248
01:05:27,619 --> 01:05:28,881
The only one that has an
incentive to come back--

1249
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:32,319
and a lovely incentive
it is-- is this one.

1250
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:34,321
Besides, only of
you's gonna come back

1251
01:05:34,452 --> 01:05:36,802
anyway, as far as I see it.

1252
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:40,240
The other one's just,
um, a distraction.

1253
01:05:40,371 --> 01:05:41,459
You mean bait, right?

1254
01:05:41,589 --> 01:05:42,939
Mhm.

1255
01:05:43,069 --> 01:05:45,071
And don't try
anything, because I'll

1256
01:05:45,202 --> 01:05:48,727
be watching you from the roof,and I'm a very, very good shot.

1257
01:05:52,252 --> 01:05:54,646
Crocodile Dundee,
you're coming with me.

1258
01:05:54,776 --> 01:05:55,560
Sol?

1259
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:56,996
Yo.

1260
01:05:57,127 --> 01:05:58,867
Take our littlestewardess and go out there

1261
01:05:58,998 --> 01:06:00,478
and retrieve our valuable.

1262
01:06:00,608 --> 01:06:01,740
Why I got to go?

1263
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:04,612
What, I'm going
to go retrieve them?

1264
01:06:04,743 --> 01:06:06,571
And, and, and-- come here.

1265
01:06:06,701 --> 01:06:08,834
What?

1266
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:09,704
Control yourself.

1267
01:06:09,835 --> 01:06:10,618
Man.

1268
01:06:10,749 --> 01:06:12,229
Hey.

1269
01:06:12,359 --> 01:06:14,666
I want her alive.

1270
01:06:35,861 --> 01:06:37,036
SOL: It's all right.
I've got you covered.

1271
01:06:37,167 --> 01:06:37,950
Let's go.

1272
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:46,872
Here.

1273
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,700
Can I come up now?

1274
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:49,570
Go get the other one.

1275
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:11,592
ROLAND: Those cases
must be pretty

1276
01:07:11,723 --> 01:07:13,638
valuable if you're luggingthem all through the swamp.

1277
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:24,692
You know, there's no wayyou're goods and all of us

1278
01:07:24,823 --> 01:07:27,173
are going fit into my boat.

1279
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:31,482
What's your point?

1280
01:07:34,963 --> 01:07:37,444
Just curious.

1281
01:07:37,575 --> 01:07:38,271
Just curious.

1282
01:07:41,231 --> 01:07:44,669
What's the range
on that thing?

1283
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:45,844
I don't, man, but
I know it works.

1284
01:07:45,974 --> 01:07:47,193
What does it do?

1285
01:07:47,324 --> 01:07:49,326
Picks up the signal
from the black box.

1286
01:07:49,456 --> 01:07:50,805
Keep your eyes open, all right?

1287
01:07:50,936 --> 01:07:53,330
For what, man, the
croc or the boat?

1288

01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:54,991
Back up, bitch.

1474
01:18:55,121 --> 01:18:56,732
No way.

1475
01:18:56,862 --> 01:18:58,211
Uh, we were going
to wait for you.

1476
01:18:58,342 --> 01:18:59,996
Not today, motherfucker.

1477
01:19:00,126 --> 01:19:01,432
Back up.

1478
01:19:01,562 --> 01:19:02,999
Back up!

1479
01:19:03,129 --> 01:19:04,391
Now, you're gonna get inthat little blue chopper,

1480
01:19:04,522 --> 01:19:05,915
and you're gonna fly me
the fuck out of here.

1481
01:19:06,045 --> 01:19:08,134
You want my help to
get you out of here?

1482
01:19:08,265 --> 01:19:09,092
50%.

1483
01:19:09,222 --> 01:19:10,006
You asshole!

1484
01:19:10,136 --> 01:19:10,963
What are you doing?

1485
01:19:11,094 --> 01:19:12,835
Shut the fuck up!

1486
01:19:12,965 --> 01:19:15,489
Done.

1487
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:17,448
Move, buddy.

1488
01:19:17,578 --> 01:19:18,884
ROLAND: OK.

1489
01:19:19,015 --> 01:19:21,669
OK.

1490
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,367
ZACH: Roland, what the
fuck are you doing, man?

1491
01:19:23,497 --> 01:19:24,934
We had a goddamn deal.

1492
01:19:25,064 --> 01:19:28,459
Hey, I got what I came for.

1493
01:19:28,589 --> 01:19:30,417
You two got true love.

1494
01:19:30,548 --> 01:19:32,028
I still got to buy it.

1495
01:19:32,158 --> 01:19:33,029
Shut the fuck up.

1496
01:19:33,159 --> 01:19:35,118
Get the fuck in the cockpit.

1497
01:19:35,248 --> 01:19:36,119
Get back.

1498
01:19:36,249 --> 01:19:37,120
Get back.

1499
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:38,817
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1500
01:19:42,516 --> 01:19:44,344
ZACH: Roland, you can't
do this shit to us.

1501
01:19:44,475 --> 01:19:45,258
MIA: No!
No!

1502
01:19:45,389 --> 01:19:45,868
You can't just leave us!

1503
01:19:45,998 --> 01:19:46,738
Come on.

1504
01:19:46,869 --> 01:19:47,870
Come on.

1505
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:48,827
MIA: Please!

1506
01:19:48,958 --> 01:19:49,828
You can't!

1507
01:19:49,959 --> 01:19:50,829
ZACH: No, Mia.

1508
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:51,787
Get back.

1509
01:19:59,446 --> 01:20:00,317
No!

1510
01:20:13,939 --> 01:20:14,897
- You can't leave us!
- No.

1511
01:20:15,027 --> 01:20:15,811
We'll find a way.

1512
01:20:15,941 --> 01:20:16,812
Come on.

1513
01:20:16,942 --> 01:20:17,769
No!

1514
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:18,683
Come on.

1515
01:20:33,872 --> 01:20:35,743
ZACH: We're getting out of here.

1516
01:20:35,874 --> 01:20:37,745
We can't be too far from a town.

1517
01:20:59,419 --> 01:21:03,206
Hey, you know, guns don't makeit in planes and helicopters.

1518
01:21:03,336 --> 01:21:07,297
Shut the fuck up and fly thefucking plane, you stupid fuck.

1519
01:21:07,427 --> 01:21:09,821
Put that gun away.

1520
01:21:09,952 --> 01:21:13,390
There's no one here
but me and you.

1521
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:14,304
You can trust me.

1522
01:21:14,434 --> 01:21:15,218
Ah!

1523
01:21:43,202 --> 01:21:47,076
Guns
don't kill people.

1524
01:21:47,206 --> 01:21:51,036
People kill people.

1525
01:22:06,617 --> 01:22:07,357
Ugh.

1526
01:22:07,487 --> 01:22:08,271
Oh.

1527
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:20,544
Ah, taxi's coming back, kids.

1528
01:22:20,674 --> 01:22:22,502
I'm still on the clock.

1529
01:22:49,051 --> 01:22:57,885
Oh.

1530
01:23:26,914 --> 01:23:27,741
Where is it?

1531
01:23:30,918 --> 01:23:32,268
Let's get the
fuck out of here.

1532
01:23:43,366 --> 01:23:44,193
Look out!

1533
01:23:44,323 --> 01:23:45,194
Shit.

1534
01:23:45,324 --> 01:23:46,064
Mia!

1535
01:23:49,894 --> 01:23:50,677
Help!

1536
01:23:54,290 --> 01:23:55,160
Grab my hand.

1537
01:23:55,291 --> 01:23:56,161
Come on.

1538
01:23:56,292 --> 01:23:57,162
Come on, baby.

1539
01:24:01,297 --> 01:24:02,080
Hold on tight.

1540
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:09,000
Shit!

1541
01:24:15,224 --> 01:24:16,573
Let's go over there.

1542
01:24:33,633 --> 01:24:34,504
It's methane.

1543
01:24:34,634 --> 01:24:35,983
Zach, stop.

1544
01:24:36,114 --> 01:24:36,984
Wait, stop the boat.

1545
01:24:37,115 --> 01:24:37,985
Stop the boat!

1546
01:24:43,687 --> 01:24:44,644
Mia, no.

1547
01:24:44,775 --> 01:24:45,471
I think we're gonna need that.

1548
01:24:45,602 --> 01:24:46,951
Just help me.

1549
01:24:58,571 --> 01:24:59,442
Come on.

1550
01:24:59,572 --> 01:25:00,312
Hurry up.

1551
01:25:00,443 --> 01:25:02,880
It's gaining on us.

1552
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:04,969
Ugh.

1553
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:05,883
ZACH: Come on.

1554
01:25:06,013 --> 01:25:06,797
Come on.

1555
01:25:06,927 --> 01:25:07,885
Ugh, damn it!

1556
01:25:08,015 --> 01:25:09,408
Mia, it's getting closer.

1557
01:25:09,539 --> 01:25:10,322
Let's go!

1558
01:25:13,499 --> 01:25:14,326
Come on!

1559
01:25:18,809 --> 01:25:20,854
Light up my
life, motherfucker.

1560
01:26:18,869 --> 01:26:21,263
Aw, no fucking way.

1561
01:26:21,393 --> 01:26:23,743
It can't be.

1562
01:26:23,874 --> 01:26:24,701
Ah!

1563
01:26:54,296 --> 01:26:55,645
Are you OK?

1564
01:26:55,775 --> 01:26:56,689
Are you sure?

1565
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:59,692
Yeah, I think so.

1566
01:26:59,823 --> 01:27:01,172
All right, let's
get out of here.

1567
01:27:08,875 --> 01:27:11,791
Use enough gas back there?

1568
01:27:11,922 --> 01:27:18,711
Well, at least we finallyhave some time alone together.

1569
01:27:18,842 --> 01:27:21,061
That's true.

1570
01:27:21,192 --> 01:27:22,759
You said you wanted to besomewhere tropical, right?

1571
01:27:22,889 --> 01:27:24,108
So.

1572
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:27,024
Have I told you
that I loved you yet?

1573
01:27:27,154 --> 01:27:29,548
No, you haven't.

1574
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:32,508
Well, I do.

1575
01:27:32,638 --> 01:27:33,422
Oh yeah?

1576
01:27:53,442 --> 01:27:55,531
It's pretty nice of theairline to put us up here.

1577
01:27:55,661 --> 01:27:57,402
Well, I think they just
didn't want to get sued.

1578
01:27:57,533 --> 01:27:58,534
Yeah, well, I still might sue.

1579
01:27:58,664 --> 01:27:59,448
Oh, you might?

1580
01:27:59,578 --> 01:28:00,318
I might.

1581
01:28:00,449 --> 01:28:02,581
Hm.

1582
01:28:02,712 --> 01:28:06,498
So what do we do now?

1583
01:28:06,629 --> 01:28:09,632
I think it's a good timeto live happily ever after.

1584
01:28:09,762 --> 01:28:11,068
I think that's a good idea.

1585
01:28:11,198 --> 01:28:12,112
Hm.

1586
01:28:12,243 --> 01:28:14,027
I think I want another kiss.

1587
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:18,423
Come on.

1588
01:28:18,554 --> 01:28:19,294
Let's go.

1589
01:28:38,182 --> 01:28:40,402
OK, now stay right here
and watch the master.

1590
01:28:44,536 --> 01:28:45,407
Ah!

1591
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:51,413
Ah.

1592
01:28:51,543 --> 01:28:52,414
Come on in.

1593
01:28:52,544 --> 01:28:53,937
It's beautiful.

1594
01:28:54,067 --> 01:28:55,417
I can do better than that.

1595
01:28:55,547 --> 01:28:57,419
Oh, really?

1596
01:28:57,549 --> 01:28:59,334
Let's see what you got.

1597
01:29:08,517 --> 01:29:09,344
ZACH: Come to papa.

1598
01:29:22,531 --> 01:29:25,403
It's OK.

1599
01:29:25,534 --> 01:29:26,883
It's OK.

1600
01:29:27,013 --> 01:29:28,885
It's OK, baby.

1601
01:29:29,015 --> 01:29:30,930
It's all right.

1602
01:29:31,061 --> 01:29:33,411
It's just a bad dream.

1603
01:29:33,542 --> 01:29:34,369
It's OK.

1604
01:29:59,524 --> 01:30:01,396
Open your eyes.

1605
01:30:01,526 --> 01:30:03,398
Don't be scared.

1606
01:30:03,528 --> 01:30:07,402
Open your eyes .

1607
01:30:07,532 --> 01:30:11,449

Welcome to our blood,
sweat, and tears.

Knee-deep in greed.

1610
01:30:21,546 --> 01:30:24,941
I'm gonna make you bleed.

1611
01:30:25,071 --> 01:30:28,945
Knee-deep in greed.

1612
01:30:29,075 --> 01:30:30,903
I want to see you bleed.

1615
01:30:40,565 --> 01:30:42,872
Ripping on the
courtesy.

1616
01:30:43,002 --> 01:30:44,264
Drop it.

1617
01:30:44,395 --> 01:30:46,919
Mercifully,
a common courtesy.

1618
01:30:47,050 --> 01:30:48,921
You'll curse and hate me.

1619
01:30:49,052 --> 01:30:52,403
I'll have you counting
birds, you see.

1620
01:30:52,534 --> 01:30:55,406

Knee-deep in greed.

01:31:04,067 --> 01:31:05,895
I wanna see you bleed.

1624
01:31:29,048 --> 01:31:30,397
Take a deep breath.

1625
01:31:30,528 --> 01:31:32,399
Breathe easily.

1626
01:31:32,530 --> 01:31:35,925
Because  recently.

1627
01:31:36,055 --> 01:31:38,928
Be friendly, do you
want to agree with me?

1628
01:31:39,058 --> 01:31:42,409
Evil,  greed
is what you see in me.

1629
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:43,889
creeps.

1630
01:31:47,066 --> 01:31:50,940

I want to see you bleed.

1634
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:10,960
You like living on your knees?

1635
01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:16,966
to be greed.

1636
01:32:17,096 --> 01:32:19,925
Evil is what you see in me.

1637
01:32:20,056 --> 01:32:21,927
tricks up my sleeve.

1638
01:32:22,058 --> 01:32:29,935
Giving
you the creeps.
