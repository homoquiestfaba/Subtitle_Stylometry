1
00:00:45,994 --> 00:00:47,494
Jimmy:
WELL, THIS IS A BIT SURREAL.

2
00:00:47,596 --> 00:00:49,463
Tommy: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

3
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:50,731
Jimmy: YOU KNOW,
ALL THIS STUFF--

4
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,133
"MEET ME IN PARKING LEVEL 6,

5
00:00:53,235 --> 00:00:55,836
COME ALONE,
LEAVE YOUR CAR HERE."

6
00:00:55,938 --> 00:00:58,505
IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,
I'D THINK I SHOULD BE WORRIED.

7
00:00:58,607 --> 00:01:00,407
Tommy:
YOU WATCH TOO MANY MOVIES.

8
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:02,643
THIS WAY.

9
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,080
WE CAN DO
OUR BUSINESS OUT HERE.

10
00:01:07,182 --> 00:01:10,417
NO REASON NOT TO ENJOY
THE OCEAN, COOL BREEZE.

11
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:13,654
Jimmy: WOW, THIS IS SOME
NICE VIEW YOU GOT HERE, TOMMY.

12
00:01:13,756 --> 00:01:18,058
Man: THANKS. THERE'S
A LOT WRONG WITH THIS CITY--

13
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,162
TOO MUCH TRAFFIC,
TOO MUCH POLLUTION,

14
00:01:22,264 --> 00:01:24,064
OVERPOPULATION--

15
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,999
BUT THE ONE THING
THAT MAKES IT ALL BEARABLE

16
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:28,201
IS TO COME HOME
AT THE END OF THE DAY

17
00:01:28,303 --> 00:01:29,436
AND TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

18
00:01:29,538 --> 00:01:31,372
Jimmy: I'M SORRY.
I DON'T BELIEVE WE'VE MET.

19
00:01:31,474 --> 00:01:32,939
Man: I'M ALEX BRANDT.

20
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,208
Jimmy: MR. BRANDT.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE STILL IN RIO.

21
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,943
Alex: I GOT TIRED OF BEING
OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

22
00:01:37,045 --> 00:01:38,812
Jimmy: I MEAN IT'S A PLEASURE
TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

23
00:01:38,914 --> 00:01:40,748
Alex: MY ASSOCIATES
HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT YOU.

24
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,216
THEY TELL ME THAT YOU'VE DONE
SOME GOOD WORK FOR ME.

25
00:01:43,318 --> 00:01:44,184
Jimmy: I TRY.

26
00:01:44,286 --> 00:01:47,521
Alex: I KNOW YOU'RE HERE
TO FILL TOMMY IN

27
00:01:47,623 --> 00:01:50,190
ON SOME DETAILS OF A DEAL
THAT YOU WERE WORKING ON.

28
00:01:50,292 --> 00:01:51,692
Jimmy: YES, SIR.

29
00:01:51,794 --> 00:01:53,761
THERE'S A LARGE SHIPMENT
THAT SOME PEOPLE I KNOW

30
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,195
NEED TO UNLOAD QUICKLY.

31
00:01:55,297 --> 00:01:57,130
NOW, I'VE
NEGOTIATED THEM DOWN

32
00:01:57,232 --> 00:01:59,466
TO SELL THE PRODUCT
BELOW MARKET VALUE.

33
00:01:59,568 --> 00:02:00,768
Alex: MY BOYS
HAVE VOUCHED FOR YOU.

34
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,603
I'M IN ON THE DEAL.

35
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,104
Jimmy: GREAT.

36
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:07,107
Alex:
TOMMY WILL LOOK AFTER YOU.

37
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:10,477
ONE THING, JIMMY.

38
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:11,445
Jimmy: YES, MR. BRANDT?

39
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:12,613
Alex: WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME

40
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:13,747
A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT PHIL RAPHAELSON?

41
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:15,816
I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'VE DEVELOPED

42
00:02:15,918 --> 00:02:18,285
A RELATIONSHIP
WITH MR. RAPHAELSON,

43
00:02:18,387 --> 00:02:19,787
AND I GUESS I GET
A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE

44
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,356
WHEN ONE OF MY EMPLOYEES
STRIKES UP A CHUMMY RELATIONSHIP

45
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:24,625
WITH THE PROSECUTOR.

46
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,794
Jimmy: MR. BRANDT, I ASSURE YOU
THERE IS NOTHING GOING ON.

47
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,595
Alex: SO THE INFORMATION
I RECEIVED IN BRAZIL

48
00:02:28,697 --> 00:02:32,032
THAT YOU HAD CUT A DEAL WITH
THE PROSECUTOR IS INCORRECT?

49
00:02:32,134 --> 00:02:35,235
Jimmy: THEY TRIED TO PINCH ME,
BUT THEY HAD NOTHING.

50
00:02:35,337 --> 00:02:37,370
NO DEAL WAS MADE.

51
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:38,639
Alex: AND IF I WERE
TO CHECK YOU FOR A WIRE?

52
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:39,940
Jimmy: I'D BE CLEAN.

53
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:41,241
Alex: WOULD YOU MIND
IF TOMMY CHECKED YOU?

54
00:02:41,343 --> 00:02:42,609
Jimmy: NO. GO RIGHT AHEAD.

55
00:02:48,851 --> 00:02:50,984
Alex: VERY GOOD.
YOU HAVE A LOT TO DO.

56
00:02:51,086 --> 00:02:53,019
TOMMY WILL LOOK AFTER YOU.

57
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:54,822
YEAH, I'M BACK
IN THE COUNTRY.

58
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,123
HOW DO WE GET
THIS PROSECUTOR,

59
00:02:57,225 --> 00:03:00,661
THIS PHIL RAPHAELSON,
TO CALL OFF HIS DOGS?

60
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,162
I DON'T KNOW.

61
00:03:02,264 --> 00:03:04,364
BE CREATIVE.
THINK OF SOMETHING.

62
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:07,300
HE-- HE'S GOTTA
GET THE POINT.

63
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:09,870
NO, NO, NO.
TOMMY'S TAKING CARE OF THAT.

64
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:12,172
[GUNSHOT]

65
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:15,375
YEAH, JIMMY'S
NOT GONNA BE A PROBLEM.

66
00:03:24,353 --> 00:03:25,619
Frank: HEY, PHIL.

67
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:27,053
Phil: THANKS FOR
COMING SO QUICKLY, FRANK.

68
00:03:27,155 --> 00:03:28,522
Frank: WHAT'S, UH,
WHAT'S THE STORY?

69
00:03:28,624 --> 00:03:30,958
Phil: WELL, THE NEIGHBOR
CALLED THIS BODY IN

70
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:32,860
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

71
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:36,229
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT
THE MURDER TOOK PLACE HERE.

72
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:38,398
Frank: IT'S A BODY DROP.

73
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:40,601
ISOLATED AREA.
NO TIRE TRACKS.

74
00:03:40,703 --> 00:03:44,004
PRETTY CLEAN.
LOOKS PROFESSIONAL.

75
00:03:44,106 --> 00:03:45,005
PROSECUTING ATTORNEYS

76
00:03:45,107 --> 00:03:46,707
USUALLY AREN'T CALLED IN
ON A CRIME SCENE,

77
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,042
SO I ASSUME YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VICTIM, RIGHT?

78
00:03:49,144 --> 00:03:50,043
Phil: YES, I DO.

79
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:51,712
Frank: WHO IS HE?

80
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,113
Phil: NAME'S JIMMY COSTON.

81
00:03:53,215 --> 00:03:55,382
WE HAULED HIM IN FOR
RACKETEERING A FEW MONTHS BACK.

82
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:57,083
THE MOMENT I THREATENED HIM
WITH SOME JAIL TIME,

83
00:03:57,185 --> 00:03:58,952
HE JUMPED AT THE CHANCE TO START
WORKING FOR ME AS AN INFORMANT.

84
00:03:59,054 --> 00:04:00,621
Frank: WHO'D HE WORK FOR?

85
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:01,622
Phil: ALEX BRANDT.

86
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:03,123
Frank: HE TELL YOU ANYTHING
ABOUT BRANDT?

87
00:04:03,225 --> 00:04:06,292
Phil: NOTHING
WE DIDN'T KNOW ALREADY.

88
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:08,428
WE WERE WORKING ON SOMETHING
TO NAIL BRANDT.

89
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:09,462
THERE WAS A DEAL
ABOUT TO GO DOWN,

90
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:10,764
AND BRANDT WAS RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

91
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:14,701
Frank: OH. MAYBE BRANDT
FIGURED OUT SOMETHING WAS UP.

92
00:04:14,803 --> 00:04:15,736
THAT'D BE MY GUESS.

93
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:16,970
Phil: WE GOT A REPORT

94
00:04:17,072 --> 00:04:19,606
THAT BRANDT ARRIVED BACK
IN THE COUNTRY A FEW DAYS AGO,

95
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:20,807
AND THIS
COULD BE OUR CHANCE

96
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,643
TO NAIL HIM
ONCE AND FOR ALL, FRANK.

97
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:25,612
BUT WE GOTTA MOVE FAST BEFORE HE
TRIES TO FLEE THE COUNTRY AGAIN.

98
00:04:25,714 --> 00:04:28,381
CAN I COUNT
ON CSA's COOPERATION?

99
00:04:28,483 --> 00:04:30,817
Frank: LET ME SEE
WHAT I CAN DO.

100
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,086
Frank: ALL RIGHT.

101
00:04:33,188 --> 00:04:35,221
Marvin: THIS CAME IN FROM
OUR BRAZILIAN FEED THIS MORNING.

102
00:04:35,323 --> 00:04:37,024
IT'S A LITTLE ROUGH.

103
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,225
Alex: I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THAT KIND OF MONEY.

104
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:40,861
YOU KNOW,
ELECTRONIC TRANSACTION.

105
00:04:40,963 --> 00:04:44,031
Man: ALEXEI ALEXANDERVICH...

106
00:04:44,132 --> 00:04:48,769
NOW THAT PLANS ARE FINAL.
WE NEED A WAY TO SECURE FUNDS.

107
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,236
Alex: YOU'RE RIGHT.

108
00:04:50,338 --> 00:04:52,005
I'LL FINALIZE
THE DETAILS TOMORROW.

109
00:04:52,107 --> 00:04:55,542
Man: FRESH START READY TO BREAK
GROUND ON THE SITE RIGHT AWAY.

110
00:04:55,644 --> 00:04:57,945
Marvin: FRESH START?

111
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,345
Frank: FRESH START
CONSTRUCTION.

112
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:01,949
THAT'S RAY JACKSON'S
COMPANY.

113
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,483
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

114
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:05,719
TIME TO SADDLE UP.

122
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:43,857
YOU'RE WITH ME, MARV?

123
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:47,127
Marvin:
I GOT YOU 5 BY 5. OVER.

124
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:49,696
Frank: RAY JACKSON.
THAT'S HIM.

125
00:05:49,798 --> 00:05:53,100
I'D READ YOU HIS RAP SHEET,
BUT WE DON'T HAVE ALL DAY.

126
00:05:55,437 --> 00:05:57,871

00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:06,113
WE'RE GONNA
LEVEL THE FIELD--

Ray: FRANK DARNELL.
WHAT'S WITH THE GETUP?

136
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,658
CSA FINALLY
HAD ENOUGH OF YOU?

137
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,092
Frank: NAH,
THEY STILL PUT UP WITH ME.

138
00:06:19,194 --> 00:06:20,360

PRETTY SLICK.

00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:26,767
I'M IMPRESSED.

142
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:28,769
Frank: SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON, RAY?

143
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:29,903

HOW DO YOU PLAN TO DO THAT
AND WALK AWAY IN ONE PIECE?

00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:37,243
Frank: ALL YOUR BOYS HERE
ARE ON PAROLE, RIGHT?

148
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:38,712
I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANYBODY HERE

149
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:40,246
THAT WANTS TO PICK UP
A VIOLATION

150

WITH A FEDERAL OFFICER.

00:18:04,131 --> 00:18:05,365
SHE SPENT THE NIGHT THERE.

I WOULDN'T BE HERE.

THAT COULD'VE HAPPENED.

JUST DROP THE CHARGES

I'D KNOW IF IT WAS SOMEONE ELSE.

ALL THE BASES, PHIL.

WHAT'S KILLING ME

488
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:21,936
IS THAT I SHOULD'VE
SPOTTED IT IMMEDIATELY

AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

490
00:22:23,706 --> 00:22:25,505
I MEAN, THE WAY
SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING,

491
00:22:25,608 --> 00:22:27,207
THE WAY
SHE CARRIED HER BODY.

492
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:28,876
I JUST PUT IT DOWN
TO NERVES.

493
00:22:28,978 --> 00:22:30,711
IF WE COULD'VE GRABBED
THAT GIRL RIGHT AWAY,

494
00:22:30,813 --> 00:22:32,479
SHE WOULD HAVE LED US
RIGHT TO CAROLINE.

495
00:22:32,582 --> 00:22:33,847
Kathy: CAN YOU DESCRIBE HER?

496
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,550
Phil: THE POLICE
SENT ME THIS FAX.

497
00:22:36,652 --> 00:22:38,185
LOOKS JUST LIKE HER.

498
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:41,455
Kathy: SHE BARELY LOOKS 16.

499
00:22:41,557 --> 00:22:43,156
Frank: FOR ALL WE KNOW, SOMEBODY
COULD'VE GIVEN THIS GIRL

500
00:22:43,258 --> 00:22:46,060
100 BUCKS AND TOLD HER THEY WERE
PLAYING A PRACTICAL JOKE.

501
00:22:46,161 --> 00:22:48,696
Phil: I SUPPOSE.
BUT WHOEVER THAT SOMEONE WAS

502
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:50,330
MADE PRETTY DAMN SURE
SHE GOT AWAY.

503
00:22:50,432 --> 00:22:53,133
Kathy: CAN YOU REMEMBER
ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT HER AT ALL?

504
00:22:53,235 --> 00:22:54,568
Phil: NOTHING MORE
THAN I TOLD THE POLICE.

505
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:58,205
SHE WAS ABOUT CAROLINE'S HEIGHT,
CAROLINE'S COLORING.

506
00:22:58,307 --> 00:22:59,873
SHE WAS PRETTY,

TO HIM IN THE HALL,

00:35:29,192 --> 00:35:30,592

WITH THE PATIENT ALL NIGHT.

00:35:37,868 --> 00:35:39,768

HONESTLY? NO, I CAN'T.

832
00:35:47,811 --> 00:35:50,345
YOU KNOW, HER FACE
WAS COMPLETELY COVERED,

833
00:35:50,447 --> 00:35:51,813
AND SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

834
00:35:51,915 --> 00:35:53,915
LET'S SEE. I TOLD HER
NOT TO TRY TO TALK

835
00:35:54,017 --> 00:35:56,718
BECAUSE USUALLY
A PATIENT'S FACE IS SO SORE

836
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,755
THAT IT'S PAINFUL
FOR THEM TO TRY TO SPEAK.

BE MORE HELP.

LIKE SUCH A NICE PERSON,

840
00:36:07,197 --> 00:36:09,297

SO BADLY ON HERMIONE'S HIDEAWAY.

841
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,832
YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN HERE 12 YEARS.

842
00:36:10,934 --> 00:36:13,334
WE HAVEN'T HAD
A BIT OF TROUBLE UNTIL NOW.

843
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:14,736
Kathy: EXCEPT FOR
THAT OCCASIONAL ROCK STAR

844
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:16,004
SCREAMING, "MEDS! MEDS!"

845
00:36:16,106 --> 00:36:17,839
Anna: HA HA HA!

846
00:36:17,941 --> 00:36:20,174
Kathy: OH, MY, THAT'S SUCH
A BEAUTIFUL NECKLACE.

847
00:36:20,277 --> 00:36:21,476
LOOKS ANTIQUE. IS IT OLD?

848
00:36:21,578 --> 00:36:22,911
Anna: IT'S NEW TO ME.

849
00:36:23,013 --> 00:36:24,112

00:36:24,214 --> 00:36:25,313
Kathy: THAT'S-- OH,
AND THE MATCHING RING

851
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:28,550
AND EARRINGS.
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

852
00:36:28,652 --> 00:36:30,084
WELL, BACK TO THE SALT MINES.

853
00:36:30,186 --> 00:36:31,219
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
WILBUR RUSSELL IS?

854
00:36:31,321 --> 00:36:33,288
Anna: YES, HE'S
JUST MAKING UP ROOM 425.

855
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,524

CAROLINE'S ROOM?

856
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:36,658

00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:38,927
Anna: YOU KNOW WILBUR IS...

859
00:36:39,029 --> 00:36:41,563
Kathy: YES,
MENTALLY CHALLENGED. I KNOW.

860
00:36:41,665 --> 00:36:42,764
Anna: BUT HIGHLY FUNCTIONING.

861
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:44,533
WE'VE NEVER BEEN SORRY
WE HIRED HIM, NOT FOR A DAY.

862
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:45,934

WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

863

00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:54,843
Wilbur: YOU'RE THE LADY
FROM WASHINGTON.

866
00:36:54,945 --> 00:36:58,046
HOLY COW. I HEARD
YOU TALKING WITH MISS ANNA.

867
00:36:58,148 --> 00:37:00,882
YOU'RE THE CSA.
THEY'RE IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

868
00:37:00,984 --> 00:37:02,317

00:37:02,419 --> 00:37:03,384
Kathy: OH!

870
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:04,953
ACTUALLY, THE HEADQUARTERS

00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:05,954
I WORK RIGHT HERE IN L.A.

872
00:37:06,056 --> 00:37:07,689
Wilbur: HOW LONG
HAVE YOU WORKED THERE?

873
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:09,858
DO YOU CARRY A GUN?
IS IT A FUN JOB?

874
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,460
Kathy: SOMETIMES IT'S FUN
AND I'VE WORKED THERE

875
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,528
FOR A LONG TIME ON AND OFF,
MOSTLY OFF,

876
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,129
AND, NO,
I DON'T CARRY A GUN.

877
00:37:15,231 --> 00:37:18,166
I DON'T BELIEVE IN 'EM.
I USE MY FINGER.

878
00:37:19,402 --> 00:37:21,369
SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU WORKED HERE
AT HERMIONE'S HIDEAWAY?

879
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:22,904
Wilbur: OH, HOLY COW.

880
00:37:23,006 --> 00:37:25,106
6 YEARS, 8 MONTHS,
AND 4 DAYS.

881
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:27,075
Kathy: YOU MUST BE
VERY GOOD AT YOUR JOB.

882
00:37:27,177 --> 00:37:30,044
Wilbur: I TRY EXTRA HARD
'CAUSE I HAVE TO.

00:37:30,146 --> 00:37:31,012
Kathy: OH, WELL,

884
00:37:31,114 --> 00:37:34,516
THIS IS AN A-NUMBER ONE
HOSPITAL CORNER.

885
00:37:34,618 --> 00:37:38,587
UM, HOW WELL DID YOU KNOW
MAC McINTYRE?

886
00:37:43,026 --> 00:37:44,993
Wilbur: MAC WOULDN'T DO
ANYTHING BAD

887
00:37:45,095 --> 00:37:47,362
NO MATTER
WHAT MISS ANNA SAYS.

888
00:37:47,464 --> 00:37:48,730
HE'S ALWAYS
REALLY NICE TO ME,

889
00:37:48,832 --> 00:37:50,599
EVEN WHEN
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE.

890
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,433
EVEN IF--
EVEN IF I FORGOT SOMETHING

891
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:53,602
OR MADE A MISTAKE.

892
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:55,436
Kathy: WE'RE NOT SAYING
HE DID ANYTHING WRONG.

893
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:56,771
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

894
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:59,040
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW
CAROLINE RAPHAELSON DISAPPEARED.

895
00:37:59,142 --> 00:38:01,309
SO DO YOU REMEMBER

896
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:04,212
IF SHE SAID ANYTHING
TO YOU YESTERDAY?

897
00:38:04,314 --> 00:38:06,748
Wilbur: NO, NOT IN WORDS.

898
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:10,018
SHE GRUNTED ONCE
AND SHE WAVED.

899
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,820
Kathy:
SO YOU'RE NOT REALLY SURE

900
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,288
IF CAROLINE WAS THE WOMAN
YOU TOOK DOWNSTAIRS YESTERDAY?

901
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:19,027
Wilbur: WELL, I PUT HER
IN THE CHAIR.

902
00:38:19,129 --> 00:38:20,428
MISS ANNA TOOK HER
TO THE GARAGE.

903

904
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:24,432
Wilbur:
I THOUGHT IT WAS HER.

905
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:25,534
SHE WAS WEARING
THAT BIG HAT.

906
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,701
Kathy: OH, YEAH.

907
00:38:26,803 --> 00:38:30,038
WELL, WILBUR,
IF YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING ELSE,

908
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,540
WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL ME?

909
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,544

Girl: LET ME OUT.

914
00:38:51,695 --> 00:38:54,563
Owen: YOU'RE NOT
GONNA SCREAM, ARE YOU?

915
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,197
I HEARD YOU LAST NIGHT.

916
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:57,832
FYI, SWEETHEART.

917
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,601
I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT CAN HEAR YOU.

918
00:38:59,703 --> 00:39:01,736
Girl: LOOK, I JUST WANT
TO GET OUT OF TOWN, OK?

919
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:03,805
YOU GIVE ME THE MONEY,
I DISAPPEAR.

920
00:39:03,907 --> 00:39:05,807
I DON'T SAY ANYTHING
TO ANYBODY.

921
00:39:05,909 --> 00:39:06,975
Owen: OH, I WISH
I COULD BELIEVE THAT.

922
00:39:07,077 --> 00:39:09,343
Girl: LOOK, I REALLY
DON'T EVEN KNOW ANYTHING.

923
00:39:09,446 --> 00:39:10,779
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.

924
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,814
Owen: THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY TRUE.
YOU DO KNOW ME.

925
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:15,717

THE NEWSPAPER AND...

LOCKED UP HERE FOREVER!

927
00:39:18,121 --> 00:39:20,689
Owen: I NEVER PLANNED TO.
IT WAS A TEST

928
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,090
TO SEE HOW STABLE YOU WERE.

929
00:39:22,192 --> 00:39:24,525
FRANKLY,
YOU'RE NOT DOING SO WELL.

930
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:27,328
Girl: I'LL DO BETTER.

931
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,697
I PROMISE.

932
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,799
Owen: OH, PLEASE, KID, HUH?

933
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:32,667
Girl: COME ON, MAN.
LET ME GO.

934
00:39:36,206 --> 00:39:38,707
Owen: OK, ON ONE CONDITION.

935
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:40,041
I PUT YOU ON A PLANE MYSELF

936
00:39:40,143 --> 00:39:42,110
AND YOU NEVER
COME BACK HERE AGAIN.

937
00:39:42,212 --> 00:39:43,979
Girl: FINE.
SEND ME ANYWHERE.

938
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:47,082
I DON'T CARE,
AND I WON'T COME BACK.

939
00:39:47,183 --> 00:39:48,917
I DON'T EVEN READ
THE NEWSPAPERS ANYWAY.

940
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,619
Owen: WELL,
REMEMBER IF YOU DID,

941
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,854
YOU'RE IN THIS EVERY BIT
AS DEEP AS I AM. YOU DIG?

942
00:39:52,956 --> 00:39:53,922

IT'S GOOD TO HAVE
A FAMILY DINNER.

964
00:40:34,138 --> 00:40:35,905

WITH CARLA SOLOMON?

966

LITTLE SISTER,

971
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:49,819
AND SHE'S EVEN
MORE OF A NERD THAN NICK IS.

Jack: YOU KNOW,
I MAY HAVE A SOLUTION.

980
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:03,799
WELL, SINCE YOU'RE SO UPSET
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER

YOU ENJOYED IT.

THINK PHIL'S GONNA CAVE,

996
00:41:54,352 --> 00:41:55,851
DROP THE CHARGES
AGAINST JACKSON?

997
00:41:55,953 --> 00:41:58,053
Parker: JACKSON'S NOT MY CLIENT
ANYMORE, REMEMBER?

998
00:41:58,155 --> 00:41:59,154
HE FIRED ME.

999
00:41:59,257 --> 00:42:03,192
Frank: YOU KNOW,
ACTUALLY THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

1000
00:42:03,294 --> 00:42:05,327
IT WOULD HELP IF
YOU WERE BACK ON THE CASE.

1001
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:07,562
LOOK, YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP
WITH BOTH MEN.

1002
00:42:07,664 --> 00:42:10,799

INTERMEDIARY. IT WORKS.

Parker: OH, DARNELL,
YOU GOT SOME NERVE.

1004
00:42:12,469 --> 00:42:13,735
YOU KNOW THAT?

1005
00:42:13,837 --> 00:42:15,637
YOU STARTED UP
THIS WHOLE HORNETS' NEST

1006
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:17,672
AND NOW YOU WANT ME TO GO
AND BEG FOR MY JOB BACK

1342
01:02:26,986 --> 01:02:30,754
Nick: WELL,
IT'S, UM, DIFFERENT.

1343
01:02:30,856 --> 01:02:32,790
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
DO YOU LIKE IT?

1344
01:02:32,892 --> 01:02:37,094
Carla: I LIKE IT.
NOW, CAN I SEE YOUR PROJECT?

1345
01:02:38,397 --> 01:02:40,731
Nick: OK. IT DOESN'T LOOK
TOO GOOD RIGHT NOW.

1346
01:02:40,833 --> 01:02:43,233
Susan: I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

1347
01:02:44,804 --> 01:02:46,336
Susan: SEE? I TOLD YOU.

1348
01:02:46,438 --> 01:02:47,838
NOT ALL COOL KIDS
WANT TO BE SMART,

1349
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:49,707
BUT ALL SMART KIDS
WANT TO BE COOL.

1350
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:50,774
Jack: THERE'S
SOMETHING TO BE SAID

1351
01:02:50,876 --> 01:02:52,375
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT
OF SOCIAL SKILLS.

1352
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:54,377
Susan: SKILLS? YOU SHOULD'VE
SEEN CARLA AT THE MALL.

1353
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:56,580
HER OWN MOTHER DIDN'T
EVEN RECOGNIZE HER.

1354
01:02:56,682 --> 01:02:57,815
SHE SAID SHE FORGOT.

1355
01:02:57,917 --> 01:03:00,684
SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT FLOOR
TO PICK HER UP ON.

1356
01:03:00,786 --> 01:03:02,452
Kathy: WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

1357
01:03:02,554 --> 01:03:03,787
Susan: THAT SHE MADE UP
SOME LAME EXCUSE

1358
01:03:03,889 --> 01:03:05,622
ABOUT WHAT FLOOR
SHE'D MEET US ON.

1359
01:03:05,725 --> 01:03:09,026
Kathy: OHH! THANK YOU!

1360
01:03:09,128 --> 01:03:11,628
YOU JUST HELPED ME SOLVE A PUZZLE
THAT'S BEEN DRIVING ME CRAZY!

1361
01:03:11,731 --> 01:03:14,131
Susan: OK.

1362
01:03:33,385 --> 01:03:35,753
Kathy: HEY, MAC.
CAN I COME IN, TALK TO YOU?

1363
01:03:36,488 --> 01:03:38,188
Kathy: THANKS.

1364
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:39,189
Mac: ANYBODY EVER
TELL YOU ANYTHING

1365
01:03:39,291 --> 01:03:40,791
ABOUT RIDING ALONE
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD?

1366
01:03:40,893 --> 01:03:42,325
Kathy: YEAH, BUT I'M THE TYPE
OF PERSON WHO BELIEVES

1367
01:03:42,427 --> 01:03:43,894
THAT NEIGHBORHOODS
AND PEOPLE

1368
01:03:43,996 --> 01:03:45,996
AREN'T AS BAD
AS THEY'RE MADE OUT TO BE.

1369
01:03:46,098 --> 01:03:47,030
LIKE YOU, FOR INSTANCE.

1370
01:03:47,133 --> 01:03:48,165
Mac: WHO, ME?

1371
01:03:48,267 --> 01:03:49,733
Kathy: YEAH. I CHECKED.

1372
01:03:49,835 --> 01:03:52,636
YOUR BIG FELONY RECORD?
THAT ARMED ROBBERY CONVICTION?

1373
01:03:52,738 --> 01:03:54,437
TURNS OUT TO BE
AN ANCIENT ACCESSORY BEEF

1374
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:56,206
FROM A BOTCHED
CONVENIENCE STORE HOLDUP

1375
01:03:56,308 --> 01:03:57,707
THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN DO.

1376
01:03:57,810 --> 01:03:59,243
OTHERWISE, THE NAVY SEALS
WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN YOU

1377
01:03:59,344 --> 01:04:02,246
OR GIVEN YOU
AN HONORABLE TICKET, RIGHT?

1378
01:04:05,084 --> 01:04:07,584
Mac: SO, I WAS STUPID
WHEN I WAS 16. SO WHAT?

1379
01:04:07,686 --> 01:04:09,019
Kathy: YEAH, WELL,

1380
01:04:09,121 --> 01:04:11,221
I DON'T THINK
HERMIONE'S HIDEAWAY FIRED YOU.

1381
01:04:11,323 --> 01:04:12,222
I THINK YOU QUIT.

1382
01:04:12,324 --> 01:04:13,323
Mac: WHY WOULD I QUIT?

1383
01:04:13,425 --> 01:04:15,025
Kathy: WELL, BECAUSE
THEY IMMEDIATELY BLAMED YOU

1384
01:04:15,127 --> 01:04:16,860
FOR CAROLINE RAPHAELSON'S
DISAPPEARANCE,

1385
01:04:16,962 --> 01:04:18,061
AND THAT TICKED YOU OFF.

1386
01:04:18,164 --> 01:04:19,129
Mac: THEY CAN BLAME ME
AS MUCH AS THEY WANT.

1387
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:20,864
WHY WOULD I CARE ABOUT
SOME RICH WHITE LADY?

1388
01:04:20,966 --> 01:04:22,766
Kathy:
I THINK YOU DO CARE, MAC.

1389
01:04:22,868 --> 01:04:23,934
I THINK YOU LIKED HER.

1390
01:04:24,036 --> 01:04:26,003
I DON'T THINK YOU WANT TO
SEE HER HURT OR KILLED.

1391
01:04:26,105 --> 01:04:27,570
LOOK, MAC,
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

1392
01:04:27,673 --> 01:04:29,873
SHE'S RUNNING OUT OF TIME.
I NEED YOUR HELP.

1393
01:04:31,643 --> 01:04:33,177
Mac: I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
PAYING YOU AT THE CSA,

1394
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:35,578
BUT THEY SURE ARE GETTING
THEIR MONEY'S WORTH.

1395
01:04:37,616 --> 01:04:39,482
Mac: YEAH, YOU KNOW,
UM, AHEM...

1396
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:42,052
I LIKED MS. RAPHAELSON.
SHE WAS ALL RIGHT.

1397
01:04:42,154 --> 01:04:44,454
SHE WASN'T ONE
OF THE KINDS WHO, UM,

1398
01:04:44,556 --> 01:04:47,057
STAYED AT THE MANICURIST'S
OR HAIR SALON ALL DAY,

1399
01:04:47,159 --> 01:04:48,091
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1400
01:04:48,194 --> 01:04:51,195
SHE'S A SCUBA DIVER, TOO.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

1401
01:04:51,297 --> 01:04:54,631
SHE WAS REALLY GOOD, TOO.
DEEP DIVES. OPEN WATER.

1402
01:04:54,733 --> 01:04:56,666
SHE EVEN EXPLORED CAVES.
REALLY GOOD DIVER.

1403
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:59,769
WE USED TO FLASH
DIVING SIGNS TO EACH OTHER.

1404
01:04:59,872 --> 01:05:03,707
SCUBA DIVERS SAY "OK"
LIKE THIS.

1405
01:05:03,809 --> 01:05:08,145
BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE UNDERWATER,
THIS MEANS YOU'RE GOING UP.

1406
01:05:08,247 --> 01:05:10,280
Kathy: OH. I CAN SEE WHY
YOU WOULDN'T WANNA CONFUSE 'EM.

1407
01:05:10,382 --> 01:05:11,481
Mac: YOU KNOW,
COME TO THINK OF IT,

1408
01:05:11,583 --> 01:05:13,650
YOU ASKED ME IF I WAS SURE
THAT IT WAS MS. RAPHAELSON

1409
01:05:13,752 --> 01:05:16,887
THAT WAS ROLLED INTO
THE ELEVATOR ON FRIDAY MORNING?

1410
01:05:16,989 --> 01:05:19,489
IT WOULD'VE HAD TO
HAVE BEEN, BECAUSE, UM,

1411
01:05:19,591 --> 01:05:21,358
WHEN SHE LEFT,
SHE DID JUST LIKE THIS.

1412
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,660
YOU TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF NOW.

1413
01:05:26,232 --> 01:05:28,031
NOBODY ELSE
WOULD'VE DONE THAT.

1414
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:29,432
Kathy: THANK YOU.

1415
01:05:29,534 --> 01:05:31,601
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I NEEDED TO KNOW.

1416
01:05:31,703 --> 01:05:33,070
OH, WAIT.

1417
01:05:33,172 --> 01:05:35,672
DID ANNA REICHMAN
EVER MENTION HER MOTHER

1418
01:05:35,774 --> 01:05:38,075
OR THE EXPENSIVE JEWELS
SHE GAVE HER, EVER?

1419
01:05:38,177 --> 01:05:39,943
Mac: NO. NO. SHE, UM,

1420
01:05:40,045 --> 01:05:41,078
SAID HER MOM DIED
WHEN SHE WAS A KID.

1421
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:42,145
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.

1422
01:05:42,248 --> 01:05:44,748
Kathy: WHY DOES
THAT NOT SURPRISE ME?

1423
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:45,916
YOU KNOW, MAC,

1424
01:05:46,018 --> 01:05:48,418
THE CSA COULD ALWAYS USE
A FORMER NAVY SEAL.

1425
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,554
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO BRING YOU AN APPLICATION?

1426
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:53,623
Mac: YEAH, SURE. CAN I PUT YOU
DOWN AS A REFERENCE?

1427
01:05:53,725 --> 01:05:56,126
Kathy: YEAH. YEAH.

1428
01:06:07,806 --> 01:06:09,339
Alex: TOMMY.
COME HERE A SECOND.

1429
01:06:09,441 --> 01:06:12,376
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD FROM
OUR FAVORITE FEDERAL PROSECUTOR?

1430
01:06:12,477 --> 01:06:13,443
Tommy: NOTHIN' YET.

1431
01:06:13,545 --> 01:06:15,045
Alex: WHAT'S HE WAITIN'
SO LONG FOR?

1432
01:06:15,147 --> 01:06:17,281
WHAT'S THE WORLD COMING TO
WHEN A MAN WON'T STEP FORWARD

1433
01:06:17,383 --> 01:06:18,648
TO SAVE HIS KIDNAPPED WIFE?

1434
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:19,983
Tommy: MAYBE THEY DON'T
GET ALONG TOO WELL

1435
01:06:20,085 --> 01:06:22,852
AND HE'S HAPPY TO HAVE
THE HOUSE TO HIMSELF.

1436
01:06:22,955 --> 01:06:24,754
Alex: GIVE IT
A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

1437
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:26,323
DO YOUR BEST TO STAY
ON TOP OF IT.

1438
01:06:26,425 --> 01:06:28,025
Tommy: NO PROBLEM, BOSS.

1439
01:06:35,688 --> 01:06:36,821
Wilbur: DID YOU FIND
MISS ANNA?

1440
01:06:36,923 --> 01:06:38,622
Kathy: NO, NO, NO. I DIDN'T
THINK SHE'D BE AT HOME,

1441
01:06:38,724 --> 01:06:40,357
AND I DIDN'T THINK
SHE'D BE AT WORK EITHER.

1442
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:42,693
Wilbur: IS THAT WHY YOU WANTED ME
TO MEET YOU IN THE PARKING GARAGE?

1443
01:06:42,795 --> 01:06:44,194
Kathy: OH, NO, NO, NO.
I JUST WANTED TO CHECK

1444
01:06:44,296 --> 01:06:46,497
SOMETHING OUT DOWN HERE
BEFORE I FILED MY REPORT.

1445
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:47,465
Wilbur:
AND DID IT CHECK OUT?

1446
01:06:47,567 --> 01:06:48,599
OK, THEN.

1447
01:06:48,701 --> 01:06:51,101
Kathy: WAIT, WAIT!
NO, NO. COME BACK.

1448

TO ASK YOU, UM--

Wilbur: OK.

1450
01:06:53,673 --> 01:06:55,105
Kathy: THINK
ABOUT FRIDAY MORNING

1451
01:06:55,207 --> 01:06:57,174
WHEN YOU PUT MRS. RAPHAELSON
IN THE WHEELCHAIR.

1452
01:06:57,276 --> 01:06:59,042
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU CAN REMEMBER,

1453
01:06:59,144 --> 01:07:00,210
ANYTHING AT ALL?

1454
01:07:00,312 --> 01:07:03,380
JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES
AND PICTURE HOW IT HAPPENED.

1455
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:07,585
Wilbur: IT-- IT'S MY JOB
TO GET THE WHEELCHAIR READY

1456
01:07:07,687 --> 01:07:09,820
AND MAKE SURE THE PATIENTS
ARE COMFORTABLE.

1457
01:07:09,922 --> 01:07:11,522
OH, THERE WAS SOMETHING.

1458
01:07:11,624 --> 01:07:13,824
THE FOOTRESTS WERE STICKY,

1459
01:07:13,926 --> 01:07:16,594
AND I TOLD MYSELF, "BE SURE
TO PUT THE OIL ON THEM."

1460
01:07:16,696 --> 01:07:21,064
I EVEN WROTE "OIL" ON MY HAND
SO I WOULDN'T FORGET.

1461
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:23,601
MISS ANNA TOOK MRS. R.
TO THE CAR,

1462
01:07:23,703 --> 01:07:25,068
AND WHEN SHE BROUGHT
THE CHAIR BACK,

1463
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:26,637
I WENT TO PUT THE OIL ON,

1464
01:07:26,739 --> 01:07:30,774
BUT THE FOOTRESTS
WEREN'T STICKY AFTER ALL.

1465
01:07:30,877 --> 01:07:33,110
DOES THAT SOUND DUMB?

1466
01:07:33,212 --> 01:07:34,411
Kathy: NO.

1467
01:07:34,514 --> 01:07:36,413

I'VE HEARD ALL DAY.

WHO KIDNAPPED
CAROLINE RAPHAELSON.

THE FLEMING SHINDIG THING.

TO SUPPORT PHIL.

ON A BUDGET. I'VE TRIED.

OH, GOD. IT WAS SO EASY.
IT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

1483

I COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT

01:08:21,861 --> 01:08:23,961
UNTIL I REALIZED
<i>WHEN</i>THE SWITCH WAS MADE.

1485

NOW, YOU REMEMBER,

1486
01:08:25,264 --> 01:08:28,098
ANNA WAS THE ONE THAT TOOK
CAROLINE TO THE ELEVATOR.

[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]

1488
01:08:37,043 --> 01:08:40,044
Kathy: WELL, SHE MUST'VE PUSHED
THE BUTTON, NOT TO LEVEL 2,

1489
01:08:40,145 --> 01:08:43,547
WHERE THE LIMO WAS,

IT'S ALL RIGHT. UH-HUH.

01:09:49,815 --> 01:09:53,316
Kathy: WILBUR REALIZED THAT THE STICKY
FOOTRESTS WEREN'T STICKY ANYMORE

1504
01:09:53,418 --> 01:09:55,418
'CAUSE IT WASN'T
THE SAME CHAIR.

1505
01:09:55,521 --> 01:09:58,188
Frank: WELL, THAT EXPLAINS WHAT
HAPPENED TO THE REAL WHEELCHAIR.

1506
01:09:58,290 --> 01:10:02,292
BUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE REAL CAROLINE?

1507
01:10:03,029 --> 01:10:05,029
Anna: HERE YOU GO.

1508
01:10:05,131 --> 01:10:07,564
YOU NEED TO TAKE
SOME FLUIDS.

1509
01:10:07,667 --> 01:10:10,400
THAT'LL HELP
FLUSH YOUR SYSTEM.

1510
01:10:11,804 --> 01:10:14,538
Anna: THAT'S A GOOD GIRL.

1511
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,407
Caroline: I HURT.

1512
01:10:17,509 --> 01:10:20,044
Anna:
I KNOW. I UNDERSTAND.

1513
01:10:20,146 --> 01:10:21,945
YOU JUST REST.

1514
01:10:22,048 --> 01:10:25,448
EVERYTHING IS WORKING OUT
JUST FINE.

1515
01:10:25,551 --> 01:10:27,084
Caroline: SO SLEEPY.

1516
01:10:30,255 --> 01:10:32,723
Phil: FRANK.

1517
01:10:32,825 --> 01:10:34,424
YOU CAN FORGET
THE INVESTIGATION.

1518
01:10:34,526 --> 01:10:36,626
I'VE DECIDED TO DROP THE CHARGES
AGAINST RAY JACKSON.

1519
01:10:36,729 --> 01:10:37,695
Frank:
PHIL, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

1520
01:10:37,797 --> 01:10:40,731
Phil: I HAVE TO!
CAROLINE IS MY LIFE.

1521
01:10:40,833 --> 01:10:42,766
I DON'T CARE ABOUT NAILING
JACKSON ANYMORE.

1522
01:10:42,868 --> 01:10:44,068
Frank: PHIL, WE HAVE
EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE

1523
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:46,170
THAT HE'S HOLDING
YOUR WIFE HOSTAGE.

1524
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:48,839
Kathy: UH, ACTUALLY,
NOT REALLY.

1525
01:10:48,941 --> 01:10:50,507
I MEAN,
JACKSON'S THE RANSOM,

1526
01:10:50,609 --> 01:10:53,310
BUT WE HAVE NO PROOF THAT
HE'S ACTUALLY A KIDNAPPER.

1527
01:10:53,412 --> 01:10:55,645
Phil: WELL, WHO ELSE BUT JACKSON
WOULD'VE MADE ALL THOSE RANSOM DEMANDS?

1528
01:10:55,748 --> 01:10:58,048
Kathy: WELL, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION,
BUT HERE'S ANOTHER.

1529
01:10:58,150 --> 01:11:00,918
WHY WOULD A MAN WHO HAS 50 CAREER
CRIMINALS AT HIS FINGERTIPS

1530
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:03,120
HIRE AN OUTSIDE NURSE
AND A P.I.

1531
01:11:03,222 --> 01:11:04,287
FOR SUCH A DELICATE JOB?

1532
01:11:04,389 --> 01:11:05,555
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE, PHIL.

1533
01:11:05,657 --> 01:11:08,959
Phil: I KNOW YOU'VE BOTH
DONE THE BEST JOB YOU CAN,

1534
01:11:09,061 --> 01:11:11,561
BUT THE STAKES
ARE TOO HIGH.

1535
01:11:11,663 --> 01:11:13,697
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING,
I'M DISMISSING THE CHARGES

1536
01:11:13,799 --> 01:11:15,565
AGAINST RAY JACKSON
WITH PREJUDICE.

1537
01:11:15,667 --> 01:11:17,935
Frank: PHIL, LISTEN,
YOU NEED TO BE PATIENT.

1538
01:11:18,037 --> 01:11:19,436
OK? WE'LL TALK
ABOUT IT LATER.

1539
01:11:19,538 --> 01:11:20,938
RIGHT NOW,
LET'S GO TO THE PARTY.

1540
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,440
Phil: I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE
TO GO THROUGH THIS CHARADE.

1541
01:11:23,542 --> 01:11:25,242
Frank: LOOK, HEY,
WE GOT EVERYTHING COVERED, OK?

1542
01:11:25,344 --> 01:11:27,644
WE GO TO THE PARTY. WE'LL MAKE
IT SHORT AND SWEET, ALL RIGHT?

1543
01:11:27,747 --> 01:11:29,880
LET'S GO.

1544
01:11:29,982 --> 01:11:31,115
KEEP LOOKING.

1545
01:11:31,217 --> 01:11:33,951
SEE IF YOU CAN CONNECT RAY
JACKSON TO ANNA REICHMAN.

1546
01:11:34,053 --> 01:11:36,286
Kathy: OK.

1547
01:11:36,388 --> 01:11:37,287
Marvin: ANNA REICHMAN?

1548
01:11:37,389 --> 01:11:38,455
Kathy: YES, YES, YES.

1549
01:11:38,557 --> 01:11:41,258
LET'S CHECK OUT
HER BANK RECORDS,

1550
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,394
SEE IF THERE'S BEEN
ANY BIG DEPOSITS LATELY.

1551
01:11:44,496 --> 01:11:47,064
Marvin: WHO'S WRITING HER
ALL THESE CHECKS?

1552
01:11:47,867 --> 01:11:48,832
GOT IT.

1553
01:11:48,934 --> 01:11:51,601
PARK FIELDS
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION

1554
01:11:51,703 --> 01:11:53,904
FOR CONSULTING SERVICES?
NICE AND VAGUE.

1555
01:11:54,006 --> 01:11:56,006
Kathy: PARK FIELDS.
PULL IT UP.

1556
01:11:56,108 --> 01:11:58,308
THAT NAME WAS ALL OVER
RAY JACKSON'S OFFICE.

1557
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:00,310
Marvin: SO, REICHMAN'S
WORKING FOR JACKSON?

1558
01:12:00,412 --> 01:12:01,912
Kathy: I DON'T THINK SO,

1559
01:12:02,014 --> 01:12:03,313
BUT MAYBE THEY WERE GETTING
PAID BY THE SAME PERSON.

1560
01:12:03,415 --> 01:12:05,916
Marvin: PARK FIELDS
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION.

1561
01:12:06,018 --> 01:12:07,918
Kathy: YES, EXACTLY.

1562
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:09,586
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
THEIR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

1563
01:12:09,688 --> 01:12:12,022
Marvin: GOT IT.

1564
01:12:13,458 --> 01:12:16,260
Marvin: NO. NO.
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF ANYONE ON THE BOARD.

1565
01:12:16,361 --> 01:12:18,628
Kathy: ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
LOOK AT THE C.E.O.

1566
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:20,130
I'M GOING TO A PARTY.

1567
01:12:20,232 --> 01:12:21,531
THAT'S THE WRONG FACE
UP THERE.

1568
01:12:21,633 --> 01:12:23,466
WAIT FOR MY CALL.

1569
01:12:31,506 --> 01:12:32,405
Kathy: OH, HONEY!

1570
01:12:32,507 --> 01:12:33,839
YOU LOOK SO HANDSOME
IN A SUIT.

1571
01:12:33,941 --> 01:12:35,107
YOU SHOULD WEAR ONE
MORE OFTEN.

1572
01:12:35,209 --> 01:12:36,409
Jack: ONLY WHEN I HAVE
TO CHAPERONE A DANCE.

1573
01:12:36,511 --> 01:12:37,410
YOU WANT TO COME?

1574
01:12:37,512 --> 01:12:38,844
Kathy: I DID IT LAST YEAR.
IT'S YOUR TURN.

1575
01:12:38,946 --> 01:12:40,513
Jack: NICK, SUSAN,
WE GOTTA ROLL!

1576
01:12:40,615 --> 01:12:41,781
Kathy: YEAH, YEAH.
YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE!

1577
01:12:41,882 --> 01:12:43,148
YOU LOOK SO CUTE, BABY.

1578
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:44,216
Nick: I LOOK LIKE A DORK.

1579
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:45,284
Susan: YOU ARE A DORK.

1580
01:12:45,386 --> 01:12:46,652
Kathy and Jack: SUSAN.

1581
01:12:46,754 --> 01:12:47,787
Nick: CAN I STAY
AT QUENTIN'S TONIGHT?

1582
01:12:47,888 --> 01:12:49,021
Susan: I'M STAYING
AT JENNA'S.

1583
01:12:49,123 --> 01:12:50,389
Kathy: I LIKE YOUR BROTHER'S
APPROACH BETTER,

1584
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:51,824
BUT, YES. BYE.

1585
01:12:51,926 --> 01:12:53,426
Jack: BYE, HONEY.

1586
01:12:53,528 --> 01:12:55,227
Kathy: BYE!

1587
01:13:41,108 --> 01:13:42,441
Kathy: ALL RIGHT, MARVIN.
LET'S GO.

1588
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:44,343
IT'S ME, JANE.

1589
01:13:44,445 --> 01:13:46,078
Marvin: WOW.

1590
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:47,346
BOY LIKE JANE.

1591
01:13:47,448 --> 01:13:49,815
[JANE LAUGHS]

1592
01:14:14,341 --> 01:14:16,341
Kathy: THANK YOU.

1593
01:14:21,482 --> 01:14:22,981
Kathy: OK.

1594
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:24,417
WHOA.

1595
01:14:24,519 --> 01:14:27,085
DON'T YOU HAVE TO BUY ME
DINNER BEFORE YOU DO THAT?

1596
01:14:27,187 --> 01:14:28,954
[KATHY LAUGHS]

1597
01:14:34,161 --> 01:14:35,728
Kathy: THANK YOU.

1598
01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:39,064
Parker: JORDAN HERE IS ONE OF
YOUR MOST INFLUENTIAL SUPPORTERS.

1599
01:14:39,166 --> 01:14:40,599
Phil: OH, THANK YOU.
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

1600
01:14:40,701 --> 01:14:43,803
Parker: HE'S CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR
CAMPAIGN IN A NUMBER OF AREAS.

1601
01:14:43,905 --> 01:14:47,272
AND I THINK
HE'S GOING TO TRY...

1602
01:14:50,445 --> 01:14:52,445
Kathy: OH. THANK YOU.

1603
01:14:52,547 --> 01:14:54,246
Frank: WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A MOMENT?

1604
01:14:54,348 --> 01:14:56,014
THANK YOU.

1605
01:14:57,117 --> 01:15:00,586
Frank: UM, MISS, ARE YOU
HERE BY YOURSELF?

1606
01:15:00,688 --> 01:15:03,456
Kathy: ARE YOU TRYING
TO PICK ME UP?

1607
01:15:03,558 --> 01:15:05,390
Frank: WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

1608
01:15:05,493 --> 01:15:07,693
Kathy: WE'RE BARKING UP
THE WRONG TREE, FRANK.

1609
01:15:07,795 --> 01:15:09,394
Frank: OK, I'M LISTENING.
GO AHEAD.

1610
01:15:09,497 --> 01:15:11,330
Kathy: PARKER FLEMING
WAS PAYING OFF ANNA REICHMAN.

1611
01:15:11,432 --> 01:15:13,332
Frank: YOU THINK PARKER FLEMING
HAD ANNA REICHMAN

1612
01:15:13,434 --> 01:15:14,733
KIDNAP
HIS BEST FRIEND'S WIFE

1613
01:15:14,836 --> 01:15:17,803
AND THEN FRAME RAY JACKSON,
HIS OWN CLIENT, FOR THE CRIME?

1614
01:15:17,905 --> 01:15:18,904
Kathy: YEAH.
IT SOUNDS A LITTLE CRAZY,

1615
01:15:19,006 --> 01:15:20,138
BUT IT MAKES SENSE.

1616
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:21,674
Frank: I'M NOT SAYING
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

1617
01:15:21,776 --> 01:15:23,275
Kathy: LOOK, FRANK,
YOU GOTTA CALL IN YOUR BOYS.

1618
01:15:23,377 --> 01:15:24,276
Frank: LOOK,
IF THIS IS TRUE,

1619
01:15:24,378 --> 01:15:25,578
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO PROVE IT.

1620
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:29,748
Kathy: I'M WORKIN' ON IT.
GO BACK TO YOUR BLONDE.

1621
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,032
Kathy: WOW.

1622
01:16:20,134 --> 01:16:21,366
Caroline, groggily:
WHO ARE YOU?

1623
01:16:21,468 --> 01:16:23,836
Kathy: UH, I'M HERE TO TAKE
YOU OUT OF HERE. COME ON.

1624
01:16:23,938 --> 01:16:24,803
Caroline: HOW DO WE DO THAT?

1625
01:16:24,906 --> 01:16:26,405
Kathy: WE WALK, CAROLINE.
COME ON.

1626
01:16:26,507 --> 01:16:28,908
UP, UP, UP!
OHH! UP, UP, UP!

1627
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:30,676
LEGS OVER HERE.
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

1628
01:16:30,778 --> 01:16:32,978
OOH. THAT'S KIND
OF CONSPICUOUS.

1629
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:36,015
OK. JUST HOLD ON.

1630
01:16:36,116 --> 01:16:37,215
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

1631
01:16:37,317 --> 01:16:39,051
UP, UP, UP, UP! UP!

1632
01:16:39,153 --> 01:16:40,085
COME ON, COME ON.

1633
01:16:40,187 --> 01:16:42,821
GOOD MORNING.
HERE WE GO. ARMS UP!

1634
01:16:42,924 --> 01:16:44,723
EXCELLENT. GOOD WORK.

1635
01:16:44,825 --> 01:16:45,858
SHAME ON YOU.

1636
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:49,361
YOU'RE WAY TOO PRETTY
TO DO ANYTHING TO YOUR FACE.

1637
01:16:49,463 --> 01:16:50,563
WELL...

1638
01:16:50,665 --> 01:16:52,330
THAT'S STYLISH IN
A DESPERATE SORT OF WAY. NO!

1639
01:16:52,433 --> 01:16:53,999
NO, NO. COME ON. LET'S GO.

1640
01:16:54,101 --> 01:16:55,901
LET'S GO. COME ON. LET'S GO.

1641
01:16:56,003 --> 01:16:58,070
UH-UH. ONE FOOT
AHEAD OF THE OTHER.

1642
01:16:58,172 --> 01:16:59,237
WE'LL PUT A MARTINI
IN YOUR HAND,

1643
01:16:59,339 --> 01:17:00,940
YOU'LL LOOK
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

1644
01:17:01,042 --> 01:17:03,542
Caroline, groggily:
WHERE AM I? WHO ARE YOU?

1645
01:17:03,644 --> 01:17:05,044
Kathy: UH, I-- I WORK
FOR THE GOVERNMENT.

1646
01:17:05,145 --> 01:17:07,279
YOU KNOW THAT PHRASE,
"HELP IS ON THE WAY"?

1647
01:17:07,381 --> 01:17:08,981
I'M PRETTY MUCH IT.

1648
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:10,649
OK.

1649
01:17:22,997 --> 01:17:24,563
Kathy: YOU JUST
WAIT HERE FOR ME, OK?

1650
01:17:24,665 --> 01:17:27,199
I'LL BE BACK IN A SECOND.

1651
01:17:38,879 --> 01:17:40,779
Kathy: EXCUSE ME, OFFICER?

1652
01:17:40,881 --> 01:17:42,447
THERE'S A DRUNKEN SENATOR
IN THAT BEDROOM,

1653
01:17:42,549 --> 01:17:43,482
AND HE'S GETTING
OUT OF HAND.

1654
01:17:43,584 --> 01:17:46,251
I THINK YOU SHOULD
CHECK ON HIM.

1655
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:56,762
Kathy: COME ON.
UP, UP! THERE YOU GO.

1656
01:18:01,602 --> 01:18:03,168
TURN AROUND. THERE YOU GO.

1657
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:05,771
RELAX, RIGHT UP HERE.
THAT'S GOOD, THAT'S GOOD.

1658
01:18:05,873 --> 01:18:07,806
Parker: JOHN! YOU MADE IT!

1659
01:18:07,908 --> 01:18:10,342
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

1660
01:18:10,444 --> 01:18:13,946
HEH HEH. AHEM.

1661
01:18:14,915 --> 01:18:18,651
Parker: ALEX. WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1662
01:18:19,419 --> 01:18:20,619
Kathy: MR. BIG.

1663
01:18:20,721 --> 01:18:23,789
Alex: WE NEED TO TALK,
MR. FLEMING.

1664
01:18:28,729 --> 01:18:30,495
Kathy: OHH!

1665
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:34,466
Kathy, whispering:
Go in here.

1666
01:18:37,805 --> 01:18:40,372
Kathy:
WHERE ARE WE GONNA GO?

1667
01:18:40,474 --> 01:18:41,640
OK, OK, OK.

1668
01:18:41,742 --> 01:18:43,642
