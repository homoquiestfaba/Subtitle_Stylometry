00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,820
Hi there, everybody.
Welcome to the movie.

2
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,260
- We're so glad you came. Now...
- Oh, Ernie. Listen.

3
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,659
I'm going to take a shower.

4
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,580
Have you seen my antibacterial soap?

5
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,860
- No, Bert, I haven't.
- Oh. Now, where did I...

6
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,700
This movie you're about
to see is all about Elmo.

7
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,979
Who are you talking to?

8
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,060
The audience.
They're right there.

9
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,300
- Yeah?
- See?

10
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,180
Wow. Look at all those people.

11
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,700
Hey, nice cardigan.

12
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,979
Now, in this movie, Elmo is
going to ask for your help.

13
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,299
He wants you to talk and play along.

14
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,299
How do we start?

15
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,699
It's easy.
Just count backwards from ten.

16
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,659
- Okay.
- You see,

17
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,220
that's how you start a movie.

18
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,179
Can you all help us
count backwards from ten?

19
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,580
- Yeah!
- Ready? Yell real loud!

20
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,939
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

21
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,380
five, four, three, two, one!

22
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,980
Heya, Bert. Don't you think you
oughta put some clothes on now?

23
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,180
What?

24
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,500
Enjoy the movie, everybody.

25
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,580
Wake up!

26
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,380
Elmo's up!

27
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,980
Wow! Hello, everybody!

28
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,500
It's so nice to see you!

29
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,699
Hey, hey. Since you're here,
Elmo wants to show you something.

30
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,579
It's Elmo's favorite thing
in the whole world!

31
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,380
Yeah. Elmo's Blanket!

32
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,780
Come on over and meet everybody, Blank.

33
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,980
Blanket?

34
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,979
Blanket! Blanket, where are you?

35
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,100
Elmo wants to show you somebody.

36
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,020
Oh. Are you under here, Blanket?

37
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,900
Blanket, where are you?

38
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,940
Oh, hey, you nice people,
have you seen Elmo's Blanket?

39
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,580
- Yes!
- Where?

40
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,259
Oh. Over there?

41
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,300
- No!
- No?

42
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,660
Where is Blanket?

43
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,819
- Is it over here?
- Yes!

44
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,020
Really?

45
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,780
Oh, there you are!

46
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,180
Oh, thanks, everybody, for helping.

47
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,580
Blanket. Hey, you come down from there.

48
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,740
No! No!

49
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,460
Blanket!

50
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,739
Elmo's so glad he found you.

51
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,580
Elmo doesn't know what he'd do
without his best friend.

52
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,740
Stop. That tickles!

53
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,820
<i>Blanket</i>

54
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,260
<i>Who's Elmo's best friend</i>

55
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,100
<i>Always by his side</i>

56
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,260
<i>That's you, Blanket Yeah</i>

57
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,660
<i>Elmo's best friend</i>

58
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,540
<i>Elmo finds you when you Hide!</i>

59
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,620
<i>Whoa! Elmo's Blanket,
a carpet, the magic kind</i>

60
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:55,180
<i>Elmo never would ever leave you behind</i>

61
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,100
<i>Elmo's best friend</i>

62
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,380
<i>Let's go for a ride!</i>

63
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,659
<i>Who's Elmo's best friend
Be still, Blanket.</i>

64
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,220
<i>Who helps Elmo try</i>

65
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,700
You, Blanket!

66
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,140
<i>Elmo's best friend</i>

67
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,900
<i>Won't let Elmo cry</i>

68
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,980
<i>Together forever in rain or sun</i>

69
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,100
<i>We do things like two
but we're really one</i>

70
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:40,540
<i>Elmo's best friend
Uh-oh. Time to wash you.</i>

71
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,899
- Uh, sir?
- Huh? What?

72
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,740
There's something wrong with this.

73
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,940
Listen.

74
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,180
It's working!

75
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,860
- Hey, you hear that? Let's whirl.
- Yeah!

76
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,260
All right!

77
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,380
Oh, yeah!

78
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,980
Blanket, you're wet.

79
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,980
- Time to dry.
- Here we go, socks.

80
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,780
<i>Together forever the world seems fine.</i>

81
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,180
- Yeah!
<i>- We never would ever</i>

82
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,300
<i>Leave you behind</i>

83
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,499
<i>Together forever the world seems fine.</i>

84
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,980
- Yeah!
<i>- We never would ever</i>

85
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,860
<i>Leave you behind</i>

86
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,980
Oh. Thank you, Blanket.

87
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,940
Hey, let's go home.

88
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,580
Oh, hi, Zoey.

89
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,740
Zoey?

90
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,740
What's wrong?

91
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,740
I really, really wanted
to go to the zoo today...

92
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,140
but my daddy had to work,
so he couldn't take me.

93
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,660
Ohh. Elmo has an idea!

94
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,380
Well, since Zoey can't go to the zoo...

95
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,780
Elmo will bring the zoo to Zoey.

96
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,180
Watch, watch, watch.

97
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,380
- What are you, a lion?
- Yeah. Watch this.

98
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,420
Oh, that's a monkey!

99
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,779
I know. It's a pig!

100
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,139
No. Elmo has something in his nose.

101
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,460
That's funny.

102
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,739
Thanks, Elmo.
You always make me feel better.

103
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,260
You're welcome, Zoey.

104
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,140
Wow!

105
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,500
Oh, what a great blanket!

106
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,780
Yeah, yeah.
It's very special to Elmo.

107
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,819
A Zoey, guess what
Elmo's going to take it home.

108
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,819
It's soft.

109
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,859
Oh Zoey, Zoey!
Elmo has a nice washcloth

110
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,179
at home you could hold.

111
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,499
Don't worry, Elmo.
I'll be careful.

112
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,500
But Zoey...

113
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,820
- Elmo wants his Blanket back now.
- In a minute, Elmo.

114
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,539
No, not in a minute, Zoey.

115
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,099
Now, now!
Elmo wants his Blanket back now!

116
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,579
- Wait!
- Elmo wants it back now!

117
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,180
It's mine!

118
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,980
Zoey! Look what you did!

119
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,180
I didn't mean it.
It was an accident.

120
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,860
Zoey's not Elmo's friend anymore.

121
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,140
What?
I'm not your friend?

122
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,660
I can't stop!

123
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,060
Stop, Telly!
That's Elmo's Blanket!

124
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,180
Elmo.

125
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,980
Oh this is so delicate.

126
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,220
- Coming through!
- Blanket!

127
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,060
My birthday present!

128
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,980
Cookie.

129
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,580
- Look out!
- Blanket!

130
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,900
- Oh, waiter...
- One second, sir.

131
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,820
- Elmo wants his Blanket back!
- I can't stop!

132
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,580
- Hi, Telly.
- Hello.

133
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,260
Blanket!

134
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,979
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, no. Not you again.

135
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,980
- Well listen. I'd like...
- Blanket! Blanket!

136
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,300
This looks like a job for Super Grover!

137
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,699
But what about breakfast?

138
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,060
No, thank you, sir.
I cannot fly on a full stomach.

139
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,140
- There.
- Huh? But... What?

140
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,740
Look out!

141
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,699
Could somebody please get up?

142
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,180
My little super body cannot
take this much weight.

143
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,100
- Sorry, Super Grover.
- They crashed.

144
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,700
- They couldn't stop.
- Everybody's okay.

145
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,739
- Where's Elmo's Blanket?
- Oh I saw it.

146
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,739
It fell out of the sky,
Oscar sneezed in it,

147
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,540
and he dropped it in his can.

148
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,699
It fell out of the sky,
Oscar sneezed in it,

149
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,939
and then Oscar threw it in his can.

150
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,940
Elmo sees.

151
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,740
Elmo!

152
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,580
- Elmo.
- Oh, something I...

153
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,379
- Elmo, are you okay?
- How many fingers

154
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,379
am I holding up?

155
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,860
That's two... two fingers.

156
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,660
Excuse Elmo. Make way.

157
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,380
Oscar, please bring back Elmo's Blanket.

158
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,299
Oscar, Elmo really needs
his Blanket back!

159
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,580
Oh, Elmo, it's okay.

160
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,019
Oscar, bring Elmo's Blanket!
Elmo needs his Blanket now!

161
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,219
Oscar!

162
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,900
Okay, Elmo, take it easy.

163
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,940
Calm down. It's okay. I don't
think Oscar's home right now.

164
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,860
Not home? But Gina,
Elmo needs his Blanket back.

165
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,740
I guess you'll just have to
wait for Oscar to get back.

166
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,179
Elmo...

167
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,979
Elmo doesn't want to talk to you, Zoey.

168
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,579
All Elmo wants is his Blanket back.

169
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,420
I didn't mean to...

170
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,260
Don't worry, Zoey. Elmo's
just a little upset right now.

171
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,819
But, Bob, I didn't mean
to rip his blanket.

172
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,379
And then Telly came, and you saw it...

173
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,820
Everybody, break it up.
Nothing to see here. Move along.

174
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,619
Just a little monster trying to
get his Blanket back.

175
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,340
- Thank you.
- All right.

176
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,539
Elmo can wait.

177
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,860
Oscar will probably be back
at any second.

178
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,619
Any second now.

179
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,980
And we're waiting.
Elmo's waiting.

180
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,860
Elmo can't wait anymore!

181
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:31,100
Oh, wow. Elmo didn't know
Oscar's place was this big.

182
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,580
Blanket, there you are!

183
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,580
Oh, Elmo's so glad to see you!
Elmo missed you!

184
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,740
Come on. Let's go home.

185
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,980
- Oh, Blanket!
- Hey, Elmo...

186
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,539
Please.

187
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,179
- Have a nice trip!
- Blanket!

188
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,900
Wow!

189
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,419
Wait, wait. Stop the film.
Stop the film. Ernie, Ernie.

190
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,179
- Oh, what's the matter, Bert?
- Well, what's happening to Elmo?

191
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:05,019
Don't worry, Bert. That's just
the way to get to Grouchland.

192
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,019
Roll film! Hey, Bert?

193
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,020
- What?
- Duck.

194
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,179
Blanket! Where are you?

195
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,260
Blanket!

196
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,940
Very colorful!

197
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,379
Wow. That was a fun ride.
Gee. Look at this place.

198
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,580
Where's Elmo's Blanket?

199
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,860
And where is Elmo?

200
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,460
Elmo doesn't think he's on
Sesame Street anymore.

201
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:46,260
- Hey, Red. You're in Grouchland.
- The greatest place on Earth!

202
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,500
A place where you can
kick off your shoes and...

203
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,500
smell your stinky socks!

204
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,980
Oh, no. I think I feel a song coming on.

205
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,340
Yuck!

206
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,180
Wow. This is great.

207
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,100
Yeah. Watch your toes.
Musical number coming through.

208
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,259
<i>Hear the steady beat of sweaty feet.</i>

209
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,540
<i>On the greasy streets of Grouchland.</i>

210
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,939
<i>Smell the stinkweed gag
the waving wheat.</i>

211
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,020
<i>What a perfect day</i>

212
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,619
<i>Make it stop!
Come on! You missed a tire!</i>

213
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,100
Come on.

214
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,779
<i>Bring in the noise Bring in the junk.</i>

215
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,179
<i>Step on a crack Step in the gunk.</i>

216
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,220
<i>Home of the world's worst traffic jam</i>

217
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,739
<i>Welcome to Grouchland Now scram.</i>

218
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,660
<i>With the gum and goo beneath your shoe</i>

219
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,940
<i>You can bet you stepped in Grouchland</i>

220
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,419
<i>It's against the law to use shampoo</i>

221
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,660
<i>so we wash with cheese</i>

222
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,460
Cheese, that's smelly.

223
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,859
Yeah, yeah, yeah

224
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,140
Here! Right here!

225
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,939
You like me!
You really like me!

226
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,979
Now, get out of here!
Get my good side.

227
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,059
That's right.
I don't have a good side.

228
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,259
<i>If you're growing old
and love the coast.</i>

229
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,580
<i>Spend your golden years in Grouchland</i>

230
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,700
<i>Where the streets are paved in
solid mold and the stinkbugs sing</i>

231
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,660
<i>Sing!</i>

232
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,220
<i>Yeah!</i>

233
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,820
<i>Bring in the junk
Step on a crack, step in the gunk</i>

234
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,620
Our motto:
I grouch, therefore I am.

235
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:41,179
<i>Welcome to Grouchland.</i>

236
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,859
<i>Welcome to Grouchland.</i>

237
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:53,260
<i>Welcome to Grouchland</i>

238
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,420
Now scram!

239
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,740
Wow. Grouchland sounds like fun.

240
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,219
- What?
- Fun?

241
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,620
You obviously don't
appreciate Grouch culture.

242
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,540
Let's send him some
greeting cards, airmail.

243
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,980
- Have a rotten birthday!
- Happy grouchness!

244
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,020
- Yeah! Get sick soon!
- Happy sour 16th!

245
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,780
Elmo doesn't know how to read yet.

246
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,180
Aww, isn't that too... Hmm?

247
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,860
It's raining! Come on, girls!

248
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,180
Rocket!

249
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,940
Oh, no, it's Huxley again!
He'll take anything!

250
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,500
Go home, why don't you?

251
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,940
- What's going on?
<i>- I'll take that.</i>

252
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,380
Hey, hey!
You're taking his greeting card.

253
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,980
<i>I'll take that.</i>

254
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,419
Hey!

255
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,579
<i>Soggy Sandy wets her pants.</i>

256
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,579
<i>That's why they call her Soggy.</i>

257
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,579
<i>Watch her do her Soggy dance.</i>

258
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,979
<i>- Then after you'll get wet.
- Is that your new Soggy doll?</i>

259
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,980
- Yeah.
<i>- You're wrong.</i>

260
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,140
<i>Guess who's changing its diapers now?</i>

261
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,540
Let go of her! No!

262
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,780
They can't do that.
That's not nice.

263
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,900
Hey, put me down, you rotten Huxley!

264
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
Wow!

265
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,860
Stop!

266
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,940
- I bet that hurt. Oh, yeah.
- Are you okay?

267
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,020
<i>Did someone say "stop"?</i>

268
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,619
All right. Who said that?

269
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,580
Which one of you dares
to question my evil ways?

270
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,020
He did. He did.

271
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,619
- Elmo said it.
- Hey, boss, he's the one.

272
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,380
I heard him.
It's the cute little red guy.

273
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,980
- He's questioning your evil ways.
- I know that, Bug.

274
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,499
It's not nice to take things
that don't belong to you.

275
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,579
He also says it is not nice

276
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,940
to take things that do not belong to me!

277
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,980
- Isn't that just precious?
- Yeah.

278
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,579
Let me fill you in on something.
It all belongs to me.

279
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,340
If I touch it, I own it. Bug!

280
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,820
You see this tennis racket?
Ping! I own it.

281
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,780
This hammer? Ping! I own it.

282
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:56,259
This velvet painting of Elvis...
I didn't really want it...

283
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,380
but... ping... I own it.

284
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,180
And this.

285
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,260
Oh, Elmo's Blanket!

286
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:08,739
You're wrong.
I didn't borrow this blanket.

287
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,980
I didn't rent this blanket.

288
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,620
Heck, I didn't even take out
a 36-month lease on this blanket.

289
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,180
No. Ping! I own it!

290
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,579
I think it's made
of all-natural fibers...

291
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,499
maybe 100% cotton.

292
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,980
Very lovely.

293
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,620
Bug, you really know how to ruin
a villainous moment, don't you?

294
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,859
Now get in the cartoonishly
evil vehicle and drive!

295
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:38,540
- Sir! Yes, sir!
- No! Wait! Blanket! Blanket!

296
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,939
You know, I would really
love to stay and chat...

297
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,980
but I have to get home to take
a nap with my brand-new woobie.

298
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,180
Say, "Bye-bye," woobie.
"Bye-bye."

299
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,419
- It's a Blanket!
- Woobie!

300
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,459
- Blanket!
- Woobie!

301
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,540
Mine!

302
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,060
Blanket!

303
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:08,179
Wait! Stop!

304
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,179
Stop the movie! Stop the movie!

305
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,379
- What's the matter, Bert?
- Didn't you see what Huxley did?

306
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,860
- Yeah.
- He took Elmo's Blanket.

307
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,299
Oh, I can't look.

308
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,419
But don't worry, Bert.
It'll be okay.

309
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,379
Right, everybody?

310
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,819
Because we know Elmo won't give up

311
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,660
until he gets his Blanket back.

312
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,860
Roll film! Let's watch, Bert.

313
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,380
Oh, okay, Ernie,
but I can't see anything.

314
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,740
Bert, you still
have your hands over your eyes.

315
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,460
Oh. I... I knew that.

316
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,299
Sure, you did, Bert. Come on.

317
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,259
Please!
Someone help Elmo, please.

318
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,940
Excuse Elmo, can you...

319
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,619
Oh, sir, can you please
help Elmo get his Blanket back?

320
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,139
I'd love to, but I don't speak English.

321
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,180
But...

322
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,380
Someone please help Elmo!
Oh, excuse Elmo.

323
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,859
That mean old Huxley
took Elmo's Blanket!

324
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,660
That makes me feel so bad inside.

325
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,420
Oh, wait.
I think that's just gas.

326
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,380
No, please...

327
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,860
Now what is Elmo going to do?

328
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,980
Hey, you're the girl with the doll!

329
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,180
The name's Grizzy.

330
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,619
How come all the grouches just let that

331
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,060
mean old Huxley guy take everything?

332
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,859
The only way to stop Huxley is

333
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,659
all the grouches
would have to work together...

334
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,020
and grouches hate that.

335
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,460
But Elmo has to get his Blanket back!

336
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,939
Okay, okay.

337
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,179
Look. Maybe I can help you.
Follow me.

338
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,180
Okay.

339
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:41,540
Elmo.

340
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,819
Sorry, Cookie. Sorry. Elmo.

341
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,779
Oh! Me having a bad cookie day!

342
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,380
Oh, me head.

343
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,700
Hey, everyone! Hey, hey!

344
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,900
- What's the matter?
- What's going on?

345
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,019
Oscar said Elmo is gone.

346
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,499
He probably went down into
Oscar's can for his Blanket,

347
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,780
but instead of getting a blanket

348
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,299
he got sucked away into some
far-off and grouchy place!

349
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,779
- And he's never going to...
- Easy, Telly.

350
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,500
Oscar probably meant that
Elmo went home, that's all.

351
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,260
No. Actually, the worrywart's right.

352
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,499
- What?
- Say what?

353
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,059
Yep. Elmo got sucked down
through a door in my can

354
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,619
to Grouchland, U.S.A.

355
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,179
- Grouchland, U.S.A.?
- Where's that?

356
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,179
This is terrible!
What are we going to do?

357
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,739
What are we going to do?

358
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,179
Here's what we're going to do.

359
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,699
We're going to go down to Grouchland...

360
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,579
...whatever that is, and get Elmo back!

361
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,500
Yeah!

362
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,740
Well, all right, but be careful.
I just had the rugs dirtied.

363
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,380
Checking around the corner.

364
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,820
Oh, joy! Fruity goodness!

365
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,580
- Come on. Come on.
- Elmo.

366
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,139
- Come on. Hustle, hustle.
- Are we there yet?

367
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,939
Almost.
Hold your horses, kid. Gee.

368
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,620
Well, Elmo, there it is...

369
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,499
Greedy Huxley's house
on the top of Mount Pickanose.

370
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,660
That's where your blanket is.
All the way over there.

371
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,859
Far, far away.

372
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,779
Well, Elmo has to
get it back by tonight.

373
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,380
Maybe you're not hearing me.
It's far, far away.

374
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,579
Oh, that's okay, Grizzy.

375
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,899
Elmo's done harder stuff
than this before.

376
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,899
Like what?

377
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,780
Elmo learned to tie his own shoes.

378
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,060
- What are you? Crazy?
- Huh?

379
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,820
If you go there, you might
never make it back home again.

380
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,340
Well, I think I've helped enough.
Good luck to you, kid.

381
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,260
But...

382
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,259
Well, Elmo's going to make it!
You'll see!

383
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,299
Elmo's going to get to that
Huxley's house

384
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,580
and get his Blanket back!

385
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,340
Who's Elmo kidding?
Grizzy is right.

386
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,500
Elmo will never get there.

387
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,340
I'm stuck.

388
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,580
Okay. Here we go, Telly.
One, two, three, push.

389
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:12,620
Thank you! We're coming, Elmo!

390
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,660
That place is so far, far away.

391
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,620
- You'll never get there, huh?
- Who was talking to Elmo?

392
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,980
- Oh, just a little green plant.
- Huh?

393
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,980
Me!

394
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,980
How come nobody ever think

395
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,259
the shrubbery got something to say? Huh?

396
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:42,059
Huh? But I do, cause I know
exactly how you feel.

397
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,859
- You do?
- I do!

398
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,699
You feel like you're stuck!

399
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,299
- Yeah.
- Well at least

400
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,339
you got your legs, am I right?

401
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,499
- Yeah.
- Well then all you got to do

402
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,219
is take the first step.

403
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,819
Now, lend me your ear.

404
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,619
<i>Elmo, get your chin up.</i>

405
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,300
<i>Things could be worse</i>

406
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,220
<i>You could have your feet
stuck down in the earth</i>

407
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,500
<i>I don't see no roots
growing from your toes.</i>

408
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,940
<i>Just two very little feet and they're</i>

409
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,660
<i>Revving, revving, revving</i>

410
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,580
<i>- To go.
- Just a little step</i>

411
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,139
<i>- And soon you will see.
- Soon you'll see.</i>

412
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,579
<i>Just how brave your heart can be.</i>

413
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,460
<i>Look on up to the sky</i>

414
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,979
<i>Take that first step.</i>

415
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,940
<i>And kiss your fears good-bye</i>

416
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,819
Now, get up there, my little
red mophead, and take that step.

417
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,940
That's it. Look at that.
I knew he could do it. Yeah!

418
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,660
Wow.

419
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,020
<i>Destiny is callin' so listen up, please</i>

420
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:49,619
<i>And you can feel the rhythm
down deep in your knees.</i>

421
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,259
<i>One foot, then the other
Your journey has begun.</i>

422
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:57,540
<i>Elmo, believe it
You're ready, ready, ready to run</i>

423
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:01,019
<i>Take the first step, soon you will see.</i>

424
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,540
<i>Just how brave your heart can be</i>

425
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,780
<i>Look on up to the sky</i>

426
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,180
<i>Take that first step</i>

427
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:14,659
<i>And kiss your fears good-bye.</i>

428
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,140
Look at that! There he goes.

429
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,900
Hey, I knew he could do it. Yeah!

430
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,500
Look at him go!

431
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,780
That's it! Just keep on goin'.
Take another step.

432
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:31,580
<i>Take the first step
and soon you will see</i>

433
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:35,180
<i>Just how brave your heart can be</i>

434
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,540
<i>Look on up to the sky</i>

435
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,980
<i>Take that first step
Elmo, we believe in you</i>

436
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,819
<i>Take the first step.</i>

437
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,499
<i>You'd better watch out, Mr. Huxley.</i>

438
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,380
<i>Elmo's coming to get his Blanket.</i>

439
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,980
Oh, that's rich, huh?

440
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,019
He's little and red and
he's coming to get his blanket!

441
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,619
<i>Excuse me, boss, didn't you
hear the little guy?</i>

442
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:06,900
<i>He's taking his first step.
Shouldn't we do something?</i>

443
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,140
Well, ordinarily I wouldn't...

444
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,779
but I am feeling a bit saucy today, huh?

445
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,139
Saucy!

446
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,979
- No pesto.
- Alfredo and a little Parmesan,

447
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,059
maybe, huh?
A little Italian Parmesan.

448
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:22,740
Perhaps I shall toy with
the little red monster. But how?

449
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,540
- Now, let me think.
- Think, think.

450
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,180
Wow, his eyebrows are huge!

451
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,979
Those aren't eyebrows.
That's my aunt and uncle.

452
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,460
Maybe if I look at it this way.

453
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,500
I know!
I think it's time for Elmo

454
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,740
to take a trip to the tunnel,

455
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,340
if you know what I mean, huh? Yes?

456
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,820
<i>What'd you say, boss?</i>

457
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:48,099
- Bug, what are you doing?
<i>- Just having a little snack.</i>

458
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,220
<i>Hard to do your evil bidding
on an empty stomach.</i>

459
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,860
Oh, sure. Listen, Bug.
Listen good. Are you listening?

460
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,100
Get back to work!

461
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,380
That was a wild ride!

462
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,980
Wow.
So this is Grouchland, huh?

463
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,859
Yeah, land of a thousand stenches.

464
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,380
Yeah, and I think I can smell
a number of them rigth now.

465
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,539
- Hey, look who it is!
- It's Oscar!

466
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,300
- Oscar?
- You look like a million yucks.

467
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,220
Yeah! Go away! Get out!

468
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,780
Take your friends with you.

469
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,219
Ah, who says you can't go home again?

470
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,339
Oscar, maybe you can get your
friends to tell us where Elmo is.

471
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,379
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah yeah.

472
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,779
In a minute.

473
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,099
First, I have to look
at the old neighborhood here.

474
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,019
Hey, I wonder where
that old septic tank is.

475
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,659
Hey. Wait a minute! No. Oscar,
we've got to find Elmo first!

476
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,819
Yeah. Elmo!

477
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,980
Let's go this way.

478
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,259
- Have you seen Elmo?
- Stop bothering us.

479
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,860
First the little red guy, now you.

480
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,779
Oh, look.
There's a police officer.

481
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,780
Yeah! Let's ask him for help.

482
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,540
It's against the law to ask
for help in Grouchland.

483
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,739
You have the right
to scream your head off.

484
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,979
Should you give up the right
to scream your head off

485
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:08,180
someone who'll scream their head
off will be provided for you.

486
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,779
- Come on.
- Me innocent.

487
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,940
Hello? Me needs cookie?

488
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,179
- Okay. Sidney. Little Ricky.
- Here.

489
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,299
- Howard.
- Present.

490
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,059
Listen. I'm going to get
the trap door ready.

491
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,019
You turn the arrow on the sign
so that it points in the tunnel.

492
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,899
- Got it.
- Ready? Break.

493
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,940
Break.

494
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,339
Howard! Howard?

495
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,340
Coming.

496
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,579
Oh! Oh man, oh, ow!

497
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,219
Ow! Your tushy bone
is crushing my skull!

498
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,219
- You're in my ear.
- Sorry.

499
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,980
Here he comes! Everybody hide.

500
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,700
I'm the king of the world!
No, I'm not.

501
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,780
Well, this must be the way.

502
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,660
- Is he in yet?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

503
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,460
Wow. A tunnel. Cool.

504
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,140
Whoa. It sure is dark in here.

505
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,180
Little help.

506
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,860
Dark and dirty and dusty.

507
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,300
The boss is going to be so proud of us.

508
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,539
Are you guys still here?
Elmo can't see you!

509
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,340
If you're still here, yell "Elmo."

510
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:45,059
What? Are you saying something?
Elmo still can't hear you.

511
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,339
Please yell louder.

512
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,619
Elmo!

513
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,339
Elmo heard you that time.

514
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,780
Boy, Elmo's glad you're still here.

515
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,380
Elmo needs some light.

516
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,180
Wow. Fireflies.

517
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,900
Hello, fireflies!

518
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,300
Oh, fireflies, can you help Elmo?

519
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,420
Can you help Elmo get out of here?

520
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,420
Wow. Thank you, fireflies!

521
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,580
Oh, nice hat.

522
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,619
This is fun! Whee!

523
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,660
Isn't this fun?

524
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,580
Oh, yay! Thank you, fireflies!

525
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,380
Don't worry, Blanket!
Elmo will be there soon!

526
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:05,460
Impossible. He's still coming?

527
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,540
I'm walking!

528
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,179
The boss is walking!
The boss is walking!

529
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,379
Ow! Sharp rocks!

530
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,979
Hot rocks! Pointy rocks!
Should've worn shoes!

531
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,460
Ooh-Ooh. The boss is walking!

532
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,460
Baloney Sandwich again? Oh.

533
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,860
Get back to work!

534
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:53,379
Why is that little red furball so
determined to get this blanket?

535
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:57,220
Maybe because it's so
devastatingly cuddly.

536
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,940
- What do you think you're doing?
- Just hugging Elmo's Blanket.

537
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,260
Whose Blanket?

538
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,580
I mean, your blanket.

539
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,379
That's right. My blanket.

540
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,900
And I'm the only one who can hold it.

541
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:22,420
Hey, tissue,
maybe you can be my blanket.

542
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:28,499
- What do you think you're doing?
- Just holding this tissue, boss.

543
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,659
- Whose tissue?
- Uh, your tissue, boss.

544
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,980
That's right. Mine.
Come here, Bug.

545
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,020
It belongs to me.

546
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:40,499
<i>The issue at hand is the tissue at hand.</i>

547
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,619
<i>And I wish you would hand
or I'll squish you at hand.</i>

548
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,059
<i>The tissue at hand to the man
who can prove he can be.</i>

549
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:53,819
<i>The most deserving he.</i>

550
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,099
<i>That's me, me.</i>

551
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:05,780
<i>Me, me</i>

552
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,020
Thank you, Bug.

553
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,860
Oh, I love that!
Bug, give me that lollipop.

554
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,020
- Yum. Tasty.
- That's mine!

555
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:16,260
<i>Look at all I got This lamp, this yacht</i>

556
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,500
<i>But what makes having fun
is knowing you have naught</i>

557
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,780
Whoa! Come on, Bug!

558
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,620
<i>Some may call it greed
It's not, it's need</i>

559
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,900
<i>A need I love to feed
The need to have a lot</i>

560
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,540
<i>I give my all to all I seize, see?</i>

561
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,020
<i>- And all I see I give to me.
- Take it, boss!</i>

562
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,580
<i>I see it, take it Then I make it mine</i>

563
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,500
<i>My little stamper adds
a pinch of perfection</i>

564
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,579
<i>On every middle is my little sign.</i>

565
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:50,859
- Yeah!
<i>- I aim to make it mine.</i>

566
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,779
<i>He sees it, takes it
Then he makes it mine</i>

567
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,579
- I truly care.
<i>- His little stamper</i>

568
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,059
<i>adds a pinch of perfection</i>

569
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,099
I give and give!

570
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,739
<i>On every middle is his little sign.</i>

571
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:04,859
<i>- He aches, he shakes.
- I ache, I quake.</i>

572
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,340
<i>- To make it mine.
- To make it mine.</i>

573
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,899
<i>Oh, my favorite teddy bear!</i>

574
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,539
<i>Ah, my yo-yo! I love my yo-yo!</i>

575
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,299
<i>Something old, something new.</i>

576
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,979
<i>Something borrowed, something blue.</i>

577
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,699
<i>Things that once belonged to you.</i>

578
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,339
<i>Like this plastic telephone
I love this highway traffic cone.</i>

579
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,019
<i>This wedding cake for Jill and Jake.</i>

580
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,740
<i>This rake This giant rubber snake.</i>

581
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,980
<i>This Chippendale Don't let it break</i>

582
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,259
<i>Oops! It's true.</i>

583
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,980
<i>Love is a many "splintered" thing.</i>

584
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,819
<i>He sees it, takes it, makes it mine.</i>

585
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,819
You better believe it!

586
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,259
<i>What an honor to be in his collection.</i>

587
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,140
It is such an honor.

588
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,539
<i>It's like an offer that
you can't decline.</i>

589
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,419
An offer you can't refuse!

590
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:43,979
<i>- He aches, he shakes.
- I ache, I quake.</i>

591
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,740
<i>- To make it mine.
- You say you love your old Atari</i>

592
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,060
<i>- I love it more.
- He loves it more</i>

593
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:56,019
<i>You say you love your new Ferrari.</i>

594
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,340
<i>Mine! I love it more.</i>

595
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,460
<i>He loves it more</i>

596
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,980
<i>Look at me I'm on safari</i>

597
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:07,020
<i>Things I want my only quarry</i>

598
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,540
<i>I love what is yours</i>

599
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,499
<i>Far more than you.</i>

600
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,619
<i>Doodly-doodly-doodly-do.</i>

601
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:17,019
<i>And if love means never having
to say you're sorry.</i>

602
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,340
<i>Well, I never do.</i>

603
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,300
<i>The lights!
Somebody turn off the lights!</i>

604
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,820
<i>I see it, take it Then I make it mine</i>

605
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,699
<i>I stamp a valentine A sign of affection.</i>

606
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,499
<i>Four little letters make a word so fine</i>

607
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,459
<i>I ache to make it</i>

608
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,859
<i>I see it, take it Then I make it mine</i>

609
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,339
<i>I give a stamp that says
good-bye to neglection</i>

610
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,339
<i>I got an offer that you can't decline.</i>

611
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,779
<i>When umbrellas disappear
They're not lost,</i>

612
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,019
<i>they're all here
With the keys you cannot find.</i>

613
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,779
<i>Pens and mittens left behind
Got 'em locked up in a box</i>

614
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,659
<i>with a million missing socks.</i>

615
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,819
<i>An army guy, a glove, here's a doll.</i>

616
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,859
<i>Oh, how I love, whoa!</i>

617
00:37:53,860 --> 00:38:01,180
<i>To make it mine</i>

618
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,739
Careful. Yeah,
don't spill the boss' drink.

619
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,780
Okay, keep it balanced now.

620
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,260
- Here's your drink, boss.
- Thank you.

621
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,539
So, did you think of a plan
to stop that Elmo pest yet?

622
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:19,619
Not yet, boss. I was too busy
listening to you sing.

623
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,300
You got a lovely singing voice.

624
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,860
Why, thank you.
I always fancied myself a singer.

625
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,379
I almost performed in the bus and truck

626
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,820
tour of West Side Story.

627
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,099
They said I wasn't right for
Maria. What do they know?

628
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,219
- I feel pretty.
- Oh, very pretty.

629
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,939
You look pretty. You should take
a weedwacker to those eyebrows.

630
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,980
- What did I say?
- Anyway, I digress.

631
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:44,019
Right now, I need you to
take care of my archenemy Elmo.

632
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,699
Elmo...
Elmo.

633
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,980
Maybe...

634
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,820
...you should arrange
a little introduction for him...

635
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,579
...to the Queen of Trash.

636
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:58,579
Huh? Queen of Trash?
But nobody ever escapes her dump.

637
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,179
- Stop the movie! Ernie!
- What's the matter now, Bert?

638
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,259
Oh, this is not good.

639
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,780
Huxley is being mean to Elmo.
It's just not fair.

640
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,380
Why would anybody be so mean
to our little Elmo?

641
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,019
Well, gee, Bert, maybe Huxley

642
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,780
just hasn't learned how to share yet.

643
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,580
Well... Well, Ernie,
do you think he ever will?

644
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:17,019
Maybe, Bert. I sure hope
that he does. Don't you?

645
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,259
Now come on, Bert, let's go
find out what happens to Elmo.

646
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,780
Okay. Good, great.

647
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,940
Uh, Ernie? Problem.

648
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,780
This way, Bert.

649
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,220
Oh, boy.

650
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:40,700
Elmo didn't know it'd take this
long to get his Blanket back.

651
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,899
Excuse Elmo!

652
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,180
Excuse Elmo.

653
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,180
Sorry, Mac, this whole area
is closed for construction.

654
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,020
Yeah. Bring it in, boys.

655
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,980
- Slow, slow, slow.
- What's going on?

656
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,179
Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow...

657
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,180
Stop.

658
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,859
- Workmen?
- Nice work, Joey.

659
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,179
- Thank you.
- What?

660
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,140
See, we're putting in a new Tarbucks.

661
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,179
Cause there just ain't enough of
those places around

662
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,780
when you want a nice latte.

663
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,939
But Elmo has to go that way
to get to Huxley's house.

664
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:20,019
Hey, look. You're making me
fall behind in my work here.

665
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,979
But you look like a good kid,
so I'll tell you which way to go.

666
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,540
- Follow me.
- Okay.

667
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,019
In order to get to Huxley's,
you gotta go down the path...

668
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,779
...through the dump, over there.

669
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:35,620
Really? Well, thank you very much
for your help. You're very nice.

670
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:40,059
Nice? You think I'm nice?

671
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,980
Yeah. Very nice. Thank you.

672
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,540
You're welcome.

673
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,740
He hugged me.

674
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,460
- You're lucky you're married...
- Ice cream. Anchovy swirl.

675
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,100
- Right here. Ice cream.
- Yeah. I'll take one.

676
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,819
- Okay.
- Hey, where's my topping?

677
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,740
Oh, right.

678
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,859
- That's disgusting.
- And delicious!

679
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,259
No problem. Have a rotten day.

680
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:14,900
Ice cream! Anchovy swirl.
Ice cream.

681
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,980
Oh, ice cream. Anchovy swirl?

682
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,899
How I long for a lick.

683
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,020
Oh, Oscar, get over it.

684
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,899
- We've got to think about Elmo.
- Cookie.

685
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,380
- This is hopeless.
- Maybe this'll cheer you up.

686
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,259
- A, B, D, E, F, G.
- Let me out of here!

687
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,379
It's torture! Let us out! Please!

688
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,619
That's it! That's it!
I can't take it anymore!

689
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,819
I demand justice!

690
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,459
I want a lawyer! Call the media!

691
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,379
- Start a defense fund!
- Calm down! Calm down, Telly!

692
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,339
Let me get you some water.

693
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:48,340
Hey, can we get some water in here?

694
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,020
- Thanks.
- I didn't get any.

695
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,140
Thank you.

696
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:15,300
This shortcut is very long.
Oh, boy. Very smoky.

697
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,899
Halt! You are trespassing
on soiled ground!

698
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,539
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait, wait.

699
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,899
Elmo has to get to Huxley's house.

700
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,059
Oh, no way, bucko.
You're going to see our queen.

701
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:34,579
- Queen?
- Yeah, and this is her kingdom.

702
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,059
- Ahh. Kingdom.
- Kingdom?

703
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,180
- Kingdom.
- This looks like junk.

704
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,300
He said the "J" word!

705
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,379
You'll find out the difference

706
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,380
between what's junk
and what's beautiful.

707
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,580
What's happening?

708
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,100
What's going on?

709
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,420
Who is that?

710
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:10,260
<i>Listen up
cause this is all I have to say</i>

711
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:14,500
<i>This could be the thing
to get you on your way</i>

712
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:20,020
<i>Just imagine what is old is new again</i>

713
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:23,500
<i>Maybe then you'll understand</i>

714
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:26,299
<i>I tell you take a look around.</i>

715
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,940
<i>And tell me that you don't see</i>

716
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,619
<i>Just a worthless pile
of garbage and debris</i>

717
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,500
<i>I see a kingdom</i>

718
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,820
<i>- Shining bright.</i>
- Wow.

719
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:44,100
<i>I can see the colors
coming through, yeah</i>

720
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:49,499
<i>You'll find the beauty if you
look at something right.</i>

721
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,939
<i>It's all about your point of view.</i>

722
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:58,299
<i>And life is
All about your point of view.</i>

723
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,100
<i>- Yeah! You go, girl!</i>
- You go, baby!

724
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:05,780
<i>Everywhere you look a story can be told</i>

725
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:10,020
<i>And the tales they tell
are worth their weight in gold</i>

726
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,659
- Hey, that's very inappropriate.
- Sorry.

727
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:15,620
Settle down.

728
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:20,619
<i>Rotting castaways and
broken bits of glass, I dare you.</i>

729
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:24,379
<i>Take a look around and tell me
that you don't see.</i>

730
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,780
Watch this. This is good.

731
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,019
<i>Just a worthless pile of
rotting and debris.</i>

732
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:34,540
<i>Cause I see a kingdom shining bright</i>

733
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:39,939
<i>And if you try then
you can see it too, yeah.</i>

734
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:44,260
<i>You'll see the beauty
if you look at something right</i>

735
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:48,339
<i>It's all about your point of view.</i>

736
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:52,099
<i>And life is all about
your point of view.</i>

737
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,500
Oh, it's our turn, come on.

738
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,020
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Okay, let's go.

739
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,060
<i>Yeah</i>

740
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:08,379
<i>I see a kingdom.</i>

741
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,740
<i>Shining bright</i>

742
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:14,779
<i>I can see the colors coming through.</i>

743
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:20,859
<i>Oh, you'll find the beauty
If you look at something right.</i>

744
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:24,339
<i>It's all about your point of view.</i>

745
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:28,939
<i>And life is all about
your point of view.</i>

746
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:36,500
<i>Your point of view</i>

747
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:39,700
Where do you think you're going?
Stay right here.

748
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,740
So who is this who trashed my dump?

749
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,379
This is him. Your Majesty.

750
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,620
- He's a trespasser.
- Uh, yeah.

751
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,459
No, no. Elmo's not a trespasser,
Miss Queen.

752
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,259
Silence, trespasser.

753
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:56,420
He says he's on his way to Huxley's.

754
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,779
- Huxley's, eh?
- And maybe,

755
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:02,459
maybe he's a Huxley spy.

756
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,059
Yeah. You know what?
I thought about that...

757
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,580
Oh, Elmo's not a spy.

758
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:08,139
Elmo just wants to get
his Blanket back from Huxley.

759
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,379
Cause it's mine.

760
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,660
Well, you certainly sound like Huxley.

761
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:14,700
No, Elmo doesn't.
Elmo's not like Huxley.

762
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:20,900
No, no! It's Elmo's Blanket!
It's mine, mine!

763
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,459
No!

764
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,379
He says he's not like Huxley.

765
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,099
Make him prove it, Your Highness.

766
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,579
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, prove it!

767
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,100
Well, I think It's time for
the ultimate challenge.

768
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,699
Oh, goody, goody!

769
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,339
- What's the ultimate challenge?
- You have to give me something.

770
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:42,460
You see, Huxley could never
give anyone anything.

771
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,859
- That's true.
- Now, if you're able to give...

772
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,939
...then you pass the ultimate
challenge and you're free to go.

773
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,659
Uh, what does Elmo have to give?

774
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,899
Well, you have to give
Her Royal Majesty...

775
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:58,180
...and that would be me...
100 raspberries.

776
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,019
The Ultimate Challenge.

777
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,620
Elmo doesn't have any fruit.

778
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:11,060
Now, now, now.
It's not fruit, dear Elmo.

779
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:13,140
Like this. Watch.

780
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:23,700
Ooh, that sends shivers down my spine.

781
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,819
Elmo... Well, Elmo can do that.

782
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,499
Elmo knows how to make that sound.

783
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,899
Good. Now, I want you
to give me 100 raspberries...

784
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,940
...in 30 seconds.

785
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:38,259
Let me go get my raspberry counter.

786
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,739
I'll get it, I'll get it.

787
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,580
No, my turn. I want to get it.

788
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:49,340
Thirty seconds to do a hundred?

789
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:52,339
Well, that's why it's called
the ultimate challenge.

790
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,459
- Ready, set, go.
- Oh, no.

791
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:56,739
Hurry. You're wasting time.

792
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,980
How can Elmo do this?
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

793
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:03,380
Can you please help
Elmo do raspberries like this?

794
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:08,419
He's getting help! Is that legal?

795
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,140
Come on! You can do it!
You're doing great!

796
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:16,100
- He's never going to do it.
- No way. Never been done.

797
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,220
We're doing it!

798
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,099
- Ooh! He's doing it.
- Good, good. Keep going!

799
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,780
You'd better move it.
You'd better move it.

800
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:28,100
- Ninety!
- I love raspberries.

801
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,620
We did it! Thank you!

802
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,219
Well, you did it.

803
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,260
Yeah.

804
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,619
No one has ever passed

805
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,859
the ultimate challenge before,
and you did it.

806
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:45,140
- Well...
- He did it! He did it!

807
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,299
- Thank you.
- Since I'm queen of my word...

808
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,499
...you're free to
go and pursue the blanket

809
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,260
or bed covering of your choice.

810
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,259
Thank you, Miss Queen.

811
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,779
And Elmo's sorry
for calling your dump "junk."

812
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,540
It's very pretty!

813
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:02,419
- Thank you, Elmo.
- Bye-bye.

814
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:05,139
- Bye-bye, Elmo.
- Good-bye, Elmo!

815
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,179
Good-bye.

816
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,619
I'm going to miss him.

817
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,739
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye, Elmo.

818
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,899
<i>It's all about your point of view.</i>

819
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,699
<i>In life it's all about
your point of view</i>

820
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:20,059
- Eight!
- Go team, go!

821
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,620
Excuse me, boss, don't you want to play?

822
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:25,419
This usually takes two.

823
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,059
Why should I when you can do it for me?

824
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,980
Besides, I think I'm winning.

825
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,060
Yay!

826
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,740
I told you!
This time I'm keeping it!

827
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,099
Hey, Bug, that was the last ball.

828
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,620
- Hey, let's try boxing!
- Oh, no.

829
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,739
Come on!
Let me see you do your stuff.

830
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,340
Come here, boy. Come on.

831
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,180
Why, that little red bath mat.

832
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,980
Bug, Bug.

833
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:11,060
Bug, stop playing games.
Come look at this.

834
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:17,379
Wow. Would you look at that?
Boy, that Elmo's something, huh?

835
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:21,259
What guts! What spunk!
What chutzpah!

836
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,579
- Bug.
- Huh?

837
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:24,460
You are really beginning to bug me.

838
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,660
Huh, probably cause I'm a bug.

839
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,580
What is it with this blanket?

840
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,259
That's it.

841
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,419
It's time to take care of that

842
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,580
little red fuzzwad once and for all.

843
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,419
Oh, no! No, no, no, no.

844
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,620
Out of my way.

845
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:52,579
It is time to release the secret weapon.

846
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:56,499
No, boss. Anything but that. You
can't do it to the little guy.

847
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,179
Oh, really?
Well, I've had enough toying

848
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,259
with that little red lint ball.

849
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,420
Just watch.

850
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,500
Ping!

851
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:09,460
Hello, Tiny. Come on.

852
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,780
Rise and shine!
We have work to do!

853
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:18,060
Elmo, you'll make it.
Just be strong, little guy.

854
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,380
<i>See a kingdom</i>

855
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,260
What's that?

856
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,019
It's getting closer!

857
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,140
Chicken!

858
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,340
I'm not that afraid of a little chicken.

859
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,580
Why should Elmo be afraid
of a little chicken?

860
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,180
That's why.

861
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,979
Hey, you dinner.

862
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:08,260
Stop running away from me.
I'm trying to eat you.

863
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,100
Leave Elmo alone!

864
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,260
Elmo doesn't want to be eaten.

865
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,980
Will you stop jumping around so much?

866
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:20,779
You're going to make me gassy.

867
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,380
Leave Elmo alone!

868
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,300
You see what I mean?

869
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,300
Now, stand still like a piece of corn.

870
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:33,059
Hey, this is not how eating works.

871
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:37,379
You stay still and then
I sneak up on you...

872
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,979
...and then I eat you.

873
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:42,619
So come on. I'm ready for a nice,
juicy worm like you.

874
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,820
No! Wait, wait!

875
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:49,980
- Elmo's not a worm.
- Excuse me. I'm not stupid.

876
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,539
- Elmo knows you're not stupid.
- Good.

877
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,580
But, but worms aren't red, are they?

878
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:57,500
Oh, well, sometime... Well, no.

879
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,059
- Well, couldn't they be?
- No. No, no.

880
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,299
Uh-uh. Worms aren't fuzzy.

881
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,780
Well, yes, but if...

882
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:07,180
Will you just be quiet so I can eat you?

883
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:10,060
Hey, worms can't do this...

884
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:14,059
<i>Elmo's a little teapot short and stout.</i>

885
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:17,180
<i>Here is his handle Here is his spout</i>

886
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,340
<i>When you tip me over</i>

887
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,539
Hey, wait a minute.

888
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,380
You're not a worm.

889
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,659
That's what Elmo
was trying to tell you that.

890
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,939
- You're a teapot.
- Huh?

891
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:30,380
I can't have tea.
I haven't had my din-din yet.

892
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,379
Wow.
Not quite what I had in mind,

893
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,860
but effective nonetheless.

894
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,300
This is not fun.

895
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,340
Oh, no.

896
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,579
Are you guys still here with Elmo?

897
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:17,659
Yes!

898
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:21,660
Oh, good. Elmo feels
a lot better with you here.

899
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,580
But Elmo still misses his Blanket.

900
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:29,059
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop the movie again.

901
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,819
- Ernie, Ernie!
- What now, Bert?

902
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:32,339
Well, Ernie, this is terrible.

903
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:35,699
Elmo didn't get his Blanket back.
How can it end this way?

904
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:36,659
- It's so sad.
- Oh, no, no, no.

905
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,659
Bert. Bert. Bert.
No, Bert. Listen.

906
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,419
- Don't "Bert" me.
- No, it's okay, Bert.

907
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,180
The movie's not over yet.

908
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,379
You mean good things could still happen?

909
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,419
Of course they can, Bert.

910
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,339
In fact, I'm sure
good things will happen,

911
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:52,140
because who'd want to see
a movie with a sad ending, Bert?

912
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:54,500
<i>- Titanic.</i>
- What?

913
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,819
<i>Titanic</i> had a sad ending.

914
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:58,500
No, Bert. Roll the film!
Come on, Bert. Come on.

915
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:00,419
<i>- Gone With The Wind?
- No, Bert.</i>

916
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,860
<i>- Dr. Zhivago?
- Shh. Quiet, Bert.</i>

917
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,180
Chocolate-covered fish cakes.

918
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,940
Hey, hey, hey, you.
You tangerine.

919
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,900
Maria, there's a grouch.

920
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,620
No, no, no. Wait.
I really want to help.

921
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:23,380
Well, who, who are you?

922
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,379
All right, all right, all right.
I'm Elmo's friend Grizzy.

923
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:32,139
- Now listen.
- Elmo's friend? Hey...

924
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:34,819
Don't let it get around
that I'm helping Elmo!

925
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:37,539
- So, where is he?
- He went to Huxley's.

926
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,340
What? Huxley!

927
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:42,779
First this guy ruined
my beautiful Grouchland

928
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:45,020
and now he's messing with my fr...

929
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:50,739
Oscar.
Were you going to say "friend"?

930
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:54,020
No, I was going to say
"french-fried fish heads."

931
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:59,380
All right. So the little
stinkball is my friend.

932
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:02,180
I got to go do something about this!

933
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:08,780
Hey. Listen up, you grouch potatoes.

934
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,659
- Come on over here. Listen to me.
- Why should we listen to you?

935
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:14,980
- I gotta get my ugly rags.
- Go soak your head, huh?

936
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:19,619
You call yourselves grouches.
Look at you.

937
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,699
This Huxley character

938
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:24,779
has taken everything that makes
Grouchland so disgusting

939
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,660
and you're not doing anything about it!

940
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:30,139
We've got to fight for our trash.

941
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:32,379
- Yeah.
- Stand up for our slop!

942
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,180
- Yeah.
- Cause...

943
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,179
...when they take our goo,
uh, we got to do!

944
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:40,059
Yeah, that's right!

945
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,099
When they take our goo, we got to do!

946
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:45,139
When they take our goo, we got to do!

947
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,619
I love goo!

948
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:53,219
When they take our goo, we got to do!

949
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:59,420
When they take our goo, we got to do!

950
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:18,699
Hey, you, get up!
You're in my spot!

951
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:22,259
- Get out of my spot now!
- Huh? Elmo's sorry.

952
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:23,739
Oh, oh, oh, oh. Hey.

953
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:27,020
Don't cry. I can get a new spot.

954
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:30,380
- Elmo's not sad about that.
- Oh.

955
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:33,860
Well, what then, huh? Come on,
my friend, tell me what's wrong.

956
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,579
Elmo didn't get his Blanket back!

957
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:39,819
Elmo can't do anything!
Elmo's just a little monster!

958
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:42,459
Little? Hey, look at me, huh?

959
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,780
I'm just a little
tiny caterpillar, right?

960
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:46,259
- Yeah.
- Wrong.

961
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:49,380
One day I'm going to be a butterfly.

962
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,019
- You are?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

963
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,819
I'm gonna change
into a beautiful butterfly.

964
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:56,179
Yeah, I will.
Cause I have what it takes...

965
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:59,219
...right here inside.

966
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:01,780
And you know what, kid?
So do you.

967
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:04,019
You proved it by getting this far.

968
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:06,580
Just look inside.

969
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:13,219
Yeah. You're right! Inside!

970
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:16,179
Elmo can do it!
Elmo can get to Huxley's house.

971
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:18,620
Yep. I knew you could, kid.

972
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,779
Thank you, Mr. Caterpillar, thank you!

973
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:24,180
Don't worry, Blanket!
Elmo's coming!

974
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,899
- Go ahead, eat it.
- You think he'd mind?

975
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:34,019
- Ah, he wouldn't mind.
- Hey, that bacon's for the boss!

976
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:37,580
And besides, Howard, your
cholesterol level's way too high.

977
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,260
- Hey.
- Morning, boss.

978
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,820
- Morning, Bug.
- I made you some poached eggs.

979
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:48,500
I pressed your favorite slacks,
the ones that make you look...

980
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:51,700
thin and villainous,
and I brewed you some coffee.

981
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:54,700
- Anything about me in the paper?
- Check page six.

982
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:56,619
What's it say?
You know I can't read.

983
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,700
Says you're a greedy, no good...

984
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,580
I mean, a lovely man.

985
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:03,580
Thank you, Bug.

986
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:08,500
Oh, it's a wonderful day.

987
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:11,819
My sun is shining,
my birds are chirping...

988
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:14,819
and my humongous chicken
has defeated Elmo.

989
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:16,099
No!

990
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,099
Yes!

991
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:20,379
And the woobie is mine, for keepsies!

992
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:22,739
<i>The woobie is mine for keepsies
The woobie is mine for keepsies</i>

993
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:24,939
<i>The woobie is mine for keepsies
for keepsies for keepsies.</i>

994
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:27,580
Give me those.
<i>Woobie is mine for keepsies</i>

995
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,219
Poor little Elmo.

996
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:30,619
I simply can't see
what's so special about

997
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,019
this stupid blanket.

998
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:33,699
Why didn't he just get a different one?

999
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,579
Maybe he loved that blanket.

1000
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:38,100
Oh "Maybe he loved that blanket."
Maybe he loved that blanket."

1001
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,020
- You don't know what you're...
- Blanket!

1002
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:45,820
Elmo wants his Blanket back, now!

1003
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,260
That little piece of macrame lives!

1004
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:54,260
Blanket!

1005
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:57,659
- Pesties! Pesties!
- Yeah, boss.

1006
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,259
Don't let him escape with my woobie!

1007
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:01,179
Ooh, that dirty rat.

1008
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,260
We'll get it, boss.

1009
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,820
Um, boss?

1010
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:20,259
Oh, brother. Where you going?

1011
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:23,060
Too, too high!
Too High, too high!

1012
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:30,020
Hey, you let Elmo and his Blanket go!

1013
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,580
I don't think so.
You and your blanket...

1014
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,220
...are both mine now.

1015
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:41,099
- No! No!
- Yes!

1016
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,380
- No!
- Yes!

1017
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,899
Stop right there, you mean old Huxley!

1018
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,180
Zoe.

1019
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,620
Yeah, come on. We got him!

1020
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:54,580
- Elmo, are you okay?
- Ah, you do have friends, huh?

1021
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:56,780
Don't they look sweet?

1022
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,419
I bet you all just have
a grand old time together...

1023
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:03,179
...just saying the alphabet
and counting all day long.

1024
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:04,620
Mmm, yeah.

1025
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:08,860
It's over, Huxley.

1026
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,139
Get him!

1027
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:12,459
Huxley don't pay me enough for this!

1028
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,219
- What do you mean, "pay"?
- Let's get out of here!

1029
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:18,100
- I want my mommy!
- Give back my stinky socks!

1030
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,859
What? Grouches, cooperating?

1031
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:24,780
How are you going to get out
of this one, Huxley?

1032
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:27,020
- I got a plan.
- Oh, yeah? What?

1033
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:29,219
I don't know.
I haven't figured it out yet.

1034
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:31,980
Not very villainous, is it?

1035
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:36,500
They may save you,
you annoying red monster...

1036
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:39,299
- but they can't save your woobie!
- No, no, no.

1037
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:42,260
That's not a woobie!
That's Elmo's Blanket!

1038
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:52,540
- Hold on, Elmo!
- Be careful.

1039
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:57,180
That's it.

1040
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:07,100
- Slime bucket.
- Yay!

1041
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:11,940
Wait a minute! Wait, wait!
Where's Elmo's Blanket?

1042
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,180
No, no! Blanket!

1043
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:26,139
That's my Bug!
Give me back my woobie!

1044
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:29,100
No, boss!
You're nothing but a basket case!

1045
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:32,460
- What?
- This blanket belongs to Elmo.

1046
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,540
Blanket!

1047
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:43,060
- Thank you, Bug.
- You're welcome, Elmo.

1048
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:47,539
How... How could you do this to me?

1049
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,099
I thought we were friends.

1050
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:52,139
No. You're a greedy, selfish villain...

1051
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:55,179
...and nobody likes to be friends
with a greedy, selfish villain.

1052
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:56,579
Come on, Bug. Be a Bug, huh?

1053
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:57,980
I mean be a bug.
Just for a second.

1054
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,659
But give me another chance.
Let me give everything back.

1055
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:03,099
I'll give back all the yo-yos
and all the Rollerblades...

1056
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:04,579
and all those bicycles,
all the kids' toys,

1057
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,259
all the dolls, everything.
I'll give it all back!

1058
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:09,299
Bug, Bug, I'll give back
every single teddy bear.

1059
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,019
I'll give back the sun and the moon

1060
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:12,379
and the Earth and the stars.

1061
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:14,979
- I'll give it all back...
- Less talkin', more givin'.

1062
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:16,780
You're not in your right frame of mind.

1063
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:18,739
This isn't when you
make an important decision, Bug.

1064
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:21,220
Bug. Bug, listen to me.
I was wrong.

1065
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:22,980
Oh, Blanket.

1066
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:28,219
This is great! Ha!

1067
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:30,819
Oh, thanks for helping, everybody.

1068
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:33,979
Elmo sure is lucky
to have friends like you.

1069
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:37,459
- We're really proud of you, Elmo.
- Yeah, way to go, Elmo.

1070
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:40,980
- You're one brave little monster.
- Oh, thanks, Big Bird.

1071
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:43,379
Let's hear it for Elmo!

1072
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:44,460
Yeah.

1073
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:48,179
Let's go back to Sesame Street!

1074
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:50,380
I know a shortcut. Ready, guys?

1075
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:53,060
Let's go home, Blanket!

1076
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:55,020
Yay!

1077
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:15,819
- Oh, Zoe.
- Hm?

1078
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:19,380
Um... Elmo's sorry
for hurting your feelings.

1079
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:23,620
Can we still be friends?

1080
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:25,580
Well...

1081
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:29,139
Yeah. Friends forever.

1082
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:30,100
Yeah.

1083
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:36,180
Wow!

1084
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:40,660
- I can hold it?
- Sure. What could happen?

1085
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:45,500
<i>Together forever the world seems fine</i>

1086
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:49,860
<i>We never would ever leave you behind</i>

1087
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:52,100
<i>Together forever</i>

1088
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:54,020
<i>The world seems fine</i>

1089
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:56,659
<i>We never would ever.</i>

1090
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:58,940
<i>Leave you behind</i>

1091
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:03,139
Elmo just wanted to say
thanks for helping.

1092
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:05,380
Elmo couldn't have done it without you.

1093
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:08,939
Elmo love you. Bye-bye.

1094
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:12,059
<i>Together forever the world seems fine.</i>

1095
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:15,620
<i>We never would ever leave you behind</i>

1096
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:17,500
See, Bert?
Just like I told you.

1097
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:20,219
- Elmo got his Blanket back.
- Yeah, it's a happy ending.

1098
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:22,379
Yup. And thank you all for helping.

1099
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:24,900
Oh, yeah, yeah. You deserve
a big round of applause.

1100
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:26,979
Oh yeah. Everybody clap for
yourselves. Come on.

1101
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:28,460
- Come on.
- You were great!

1102
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:30,859
Okay, Bert, time to go home.

1103
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,539
Yeah, I knew everything
was gonna be okay.

1104
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:33,579
- Sure you did.
- I knew Elmo would get

1105
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:34,499
- his Blanket back.
- Yeah, right.

1106
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:35,659
I knew there would be a happy ending.

1107
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:38,780
- Of course, Bert.
- See ya. Oh, look, look, look.

1108
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:40,979
Ernie, credits! Oh!

1109
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:42,579
I want to see who did the catering.

1110
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:44,259
That was really good toast.

1111
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:45,859
You know, they cut off
the crusts and everything.

1112
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:48,099
Uh, Bert?
Time to feed your pigeons.

1113
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:51,020
- Oh, oh, thank you. Bernice!
- Bye-bye.
