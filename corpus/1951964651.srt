1
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,699
<i>Just look at him.</i>

2
00:00:53,872 --> 00:00:57,069
<i>So sleek, so powerful...</i>

3
00:00:57,276 --> 00:01:00,803
<i>...so beautiful.</i>

4
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:04,005
<i>Like some great
golden god made flesh.</i>

5
00:01:04,183 --> 00:01:07,778
<i>Of course, any sensible god
would demand absolute obedience...</i>

6
00:01:07,953 --> 00:01:09,921
<i>...in return for his favor.</i>

7
00:01:10,089 --> 00:01:15,186
<i>But, no, our Man of Steel
protects us and keeps us...</i>

8
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,157
<i>...with no strings attached.</i>

9
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:19,854
<i>And the people, hmm...</i>

10
00:01:20,032 --> 00:01:22,694
<i>...they practically
worship him anyway.</i>

11
00:01:22,868 --> 00:01:27,305
<i>Enjoy your reign
while you may, Superman.</i>

12
00:01:27,473 --> 00:01:30,840
<i>For as surely as night follows day...</i>

13
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:36,242
<i>...there comes a time
when even gods must die.</i>

14
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,277
I don't care how many weeks
you spent on that story, Lane.

15
00:03:48,447 --> 00:03:52,110
<i>The Daily Planet is not about
to attack a charity organization.</i>

16
00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:55,776
You know Lex Luthor couldn't care less
about the homeless, chief.

17
00:03:55,954 --> 00:03:57,854
It's a front to siphon money
back to LexCorp...

18
00:03:58,023 --> 00:04:00,355
...so he can fund the manufacture
of high-tech arms...

19
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:02,220
...to sell on the black market.

20
00:04:02,394 --> 00:04:03,725
Allegedly.

21
00:04:03,896 --> 00:04:06,990
Look, how many exposés do I have to write
before Metropolis wakes up...

22
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:09,725
...and sees through
Luthor's philanthropy shtick?

23
00:04:09,902 --> 00:04:11,563
As many as it takes.

24
00:04:11,737 --> 00:04:13,830
But it helps to have a smoking gun.

25
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:16,133
You sure you're not
on LexCorp's payroll, chief?

26
00:04:16,308 --> 00:04:19,106
You've been mighty soft
on the prince of darkness lately.

27
00:04:19,278 --> 00:04:23,647
Excuse me for not wanting
to be sued for libel, again.

28
00:04:23,815 --> 00:04:25,646
Well, LexCorp's going down...

29
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:28,376
...whether it's me
or Superman who does it.

30
00:04:28,553 --> 00:04:32,922
If it's Superman, that makes it news,
and I'll be happy to print it.

31
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:35,252
Kent, shouldn't you be
on your way to the airport?

32
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:40,261
I always make my flight, chief.
Just packing the last of my things.

33
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:41,763
Well, don't forget to write.

34
00:04:42,234 --> 00:04:43,428
Sure thing, Perry.

35
00:04:44,102 --> 00:04:48,505
Articles, Kent, articles.
That's what foreign correspondents do.

36
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:51,335
Perry's really broken up
about you leaving.

37
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,501
Ah, he'll miss me
when I'm gone, Jimmy.

38
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,955
Well, I'm off to Afghanistan, Lois.

39
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:12,619
Happy trails, Smallville.

40
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:16,965
Guess I'll be seeing you.

41
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:18,863
Don't step on any landmines.

42
00:06:02,614 --> 00:06:04,707
Two miles below Earth's surface.

43
00:06:04,883 --> 00:06:06,646
Even Superman can't see us here.

44
00:06:06,818 --> 00:06:09,981
Luthor's sure to be happy about that.

45
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:17,728
- Heat's fricking unbearable.
- Yeah, forget Luthor and his happiness.

46
00:06:18,163 --> 00:06:20,495
"I shall invent a new energy source...

47
00:06:20,665 --> 00:06:24,123
...by harnessing radiation
emitted from the Earth's core. "

48
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:27,328
And rake in billions while we drown
in our own sweat.

49
00:06:27,506 --> 00:06:30,236
Don't be surprised if he asks us
to dig straight to hell.

50
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:31,603
We're halfway there already.

51
00:06:31,777 --> 00:06:34,644
"Insert a diode catheter
into Satan's rectum...

52
00:06:34,813 --> 00:06:38,044
...run a feed back to LexCorp,
and crank up the juice. "

53
00:06:38,216 --> 00:06:41,947
"Keep Metropolis' power grids
burning bright until the end of time. "

54
00:06:44,523 --> 00:06:47,117
Whoa! Dr. Murphy.

55
00:06:50,162 --> 00:06:52,153
- What is it?
- I'm no scientist.

56
00:06:52,464 --> 00:06:54,625
You tell me.

57
00:07:06,044 --> 00:07:07,807
Lex.

58
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,269
Oh.

59
00:07:12,684 --> 00:07:16,176
Get this to Biochem, hand-carry only.
Keep it off the interlink.

60
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:19,285
I know the drill, Lex.
What is it, the cure for cancer?

61
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,789
Muscular dystrophy.

62
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,622
I can cure every known case
with a simple inoculation.

63
00:07:24,796 --> 00:07:27,560
Have Swan find a way
to slow it to a crawl...

64
00:07:27,732 --> 00:07:30,030
...turn it into
a lifetime treatment program.

65
00:07:30,335 --> 00:07:32,860
Right now, it's a mere
$300-billion windfall.

66
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:35,700
And you need it
to be a perennial, got it.

67
00:07:35,907 --> 00:07:37,704
But Swan's working the AIDS thing.

68
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,970
Oh, right.
What about Schaffenberger?

69
00:07:41,146 --> 00:07:43,114
- Bird flu.
- Mm.

70
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:46,216
Guess Jerry's kids
will have to wait their turn.

71
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:48,716
Now, Mercy,
what have you got for me?

72
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:52,550
Project Applecore.
They've hit the mother lode.

73
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,648
Have you cured cancer yet, Kal-El?

74
00:08:17,816 --> 00:08:20,182
I can design a machine
that receives faint transmissions...

75
00:08:20,352 --> 00:08:22,946
...from the distant future,
sculpt a miniature sun...

76
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:24,679
...from dwarf-star matter...

77
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:28,189
...but I can't find a way to keep
human cells from metastasizing.

78
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,592
I wish I could help humankind by doing
more than just being its resident strongman.

79
00:08:32,764 --> 00:08:35,790
One thing I've learned since arriving
in Metropolis is that those in power...

80
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:38,026
...don't always have
the people's interests at heart.

81
00:08:38,203 --> 00:08:40,637
As much as I love dishing
on evil bald-headed freaks...

82
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:42,773
...I thought we came here
to get away from it all.

83
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:44,602
You wouldn't have a blow-dryer?

84
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,608
We'll need to get you
a larger travel bag, Lois.

85
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:51,943
I wouldn't need so many warm baths
if our weekend getaway was Palm Springs.

86
00:08:52,117 --> 00:08:56,144
The Antarctic camouflages Kryptonian
crystal-tech far better than cacti.

87
00:08:56,321 --> 00:09:00,155
But next time you catch a chill,
give a holler, I'll warm you.

88
00:09:00,325 --> 00:09:03,658
You wouldn't use your heat vision
on me, would you, Superman?

89
00:09:03,828 --> 00:09:07,127
- No, just the x-ray.
- You're bad.

90
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:20,910
Um, maybe we could find
a robot-free zone?

91
00:09:32,257 --> 00:09:33,485
That's it, Mr. Luthor.

92
00:09:35,093 --> 00:09:37,823
<i>- Definitely a spacecraft.
- Of alien origin.</i>

93
00:09:37,996 --> 00:09:39,156
Vintage?

94
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:41,424
<i>- We're deep.
- Before Christ deep.</i>

95
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,090
<i>That's a conservative estimate.</i>

96
00:09:43,268 --> 00:09:46,931
Last time aliens fell to Earth,
we got Superman.

97
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:50,563
This time, whatever's
in that tin can will belong to me...

98
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:53,608
...lock, stock and barrel.

99
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,419
What happened?

100
00:10:07,826 --> 00:10:10,021
<i>We have a puncture.</i>

101
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,172
<i>How are we supposed
to understand him?</i>

102
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:28,202
It's a warning.

103
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,052
Aah!
Clear out! Clear out!

104
00:10:56,441 --> 00:10:58,773
Use the rays of the laser.

105
00:11:37,382 --> 00:11:40,681
If an alien race possessed
the technology to trap that thing...

106
00:11:40,852 --> 00:11:44,720
...and use Earth as their personal toilet,
they did so for one reason.

107
00:11:45,957 --> 00:11:47,720
They couldn't kill it.

108
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:26,590
You know, I've been thinking...

109
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:28,995
- Hmm?
- About Clark.

110
00:12:29,701 --> 00:12:32,192
Kent? While you're snuggling
with me?

111
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,270
I think I'm jealous.

112
00:12:34,706 --> 00:12:38,267
Smallville's going on assignment
in a dangerous part of the world.

113
00:12:38,443 --> 00:12:41,378
They say I'm brave,
but I'm bulletproof.

114
00:12:41,546 --> 00:12:43,844
Ordinary men and women
who put their lives on the line...

115
00:12:44,015 --> 00:12:45,607
...they're the real heroes.

116
00:12:45,784 --> 00:12:48,810
I just find it interesting that
the more intimate you and I become...

117
00:12:48,987 --> 00:12:53,447
...the more distant
Clark becomes, literally.

118
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:58,793
Superman, I wanna know everything
there is to know about you...

119
00:12:58,963 --> 00:13:00,658
...like your real name.

120
00:13:00,832 --> 00:13:03,323
Hmm. It's Kal-El.

121
00:13:03,802 --> 00:13:06,498
Your other real name.

122
00:13:23,988 --> 00:13:25,819
Biscuit.

123
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:29,489
Biscuit.

124
00:13:33,097 --> 00:13:34,086
Mother...

125
00:13:38,436 --> 00:13:40,404
Aaarggh!

126
00:13:51,483 --> 00:13:56,750
That monster's trail of destruction will
lead the authorities right to my doorstep.

127
00:13:57,088 --> 00:14:01,991
Relax, Lex. Applecore may have been illegal,
but it was completely under the radar.

128
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,527
See that it stays that way.
Scorch Earth if you have to.

129
00:14:05,897 --> 00:14:08,957
LexCorp was never there.

130
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:12,970
Look, I know who you are.
Why can't you just tell me?

131
00:14:13,137 --> 00:14:15,867
Lois, I care about you
more than anyone else on Earth.

132
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,203
To reveal my secret identity
would compromise your safety.

133
00:14:19,377 --> 00:14:22,437
Please. My safety was compromised
the moment I met you.

134
00:14:22,614 --> 00:14:24,605
How many times
have you had to rescue me?

135
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,339
Rhetorical.

136
00:14:26,518 --> 00:14:29,544
I haven't told you my identity for the
same reason we haven't gone public...

137
00:14:29,721 --> 00:14:32,588
...with our relationship,
why we come here to be alone.

138
00:14:32,757 --> 00:14:34,748
Well, try reading a gossip column.

139
00:14:34,926 --> 00:14:37,986
Practically all of Metropolis
thinks we're dating anyway.

140
00:14:38,162 --> 00:14:40,687
You're clinging to keep one last part
of you separate from us...

141
00:14:40,865 --> 00:14:43,663
...and the only reason I can fathom
is that for an alien...

142
00:14:43,835 --> 00:14:48,272
...you've developed a very human,
very male fear of commitment.

143
00:14:48,573 --> 00:14:50,006
We've been together for six months.

144
00:14:50,174 --> 00:14:54,133
It'd be nice if I could start calling you
something other than Superman.

145
00:14:54,312 --> 00:14:57,611
He also goes by Kal-El.
- Shut up.

146
00:16:00,812 --> 00:16:03,303
Well, that was some first fight.

147
00:16:03,481 --> 00:16:06,348
Be nice if it was our last.

148
00:16:16,728 --> 00:16:19,697
Maybe you're right. Maybe it is time
you got to know the real me.

149
00:16:19,864 --> 00:16:21,593
Kal-El.

150
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,133
- This isn't a good time.
You are needed in Metropolis.

151
00:16:25,303 --> 00:16:27,396
It is a matter of terrific urgency.

152
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:30,571
I have isolated a match
via interstellar records...

153
00:16:30,742 --> 00:16:32,141
...from your father's archives.

154
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,972
The subject in question
was biologically engineered...

155
00:16:35,146 --> 00:16:36,477
...to be the ultimate soldier.

156
00:16:36,648 --> 00:16:39,583
Precise, clinical, unstoppable.

157
00:16:39,751 --> 00:16:41,218
But its creators came to realize...

158
00:16:41,386 --> 00:16:44,480
...that it could not distinguish
between friend and foe.

159
00:16:45,256 --> 00:16:49,249
Thus, this doomsday machine lives to
extinguish any and all life forms...

160
00:16:50,228 --> 00:16:52,526
...because it must.

161
00:16:53,831 --> 00:16:56,857
We need to clear this area.

162
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:11,037
Fire!

163
00:17:27,832 --> 00:17:29,493
You're dropping me off here?

164
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:32,261
Doomsday's at Hob's End
on the East Side.

165
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:34,628
Exactly.

166
00:17:37,308 --> 00:17:39,776
Jimmy, meet me on the roof,
and don't forget your camera.

167
00:19:40,698 --> 00:19:43,599
Uh, Lois, shouldn't we wait
for a pilot?

168
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:45,565
I'm an Air Force brat, remember?

169
00:19:45,736 --> 00:19:48,569
I was flying these things
when you were still in training pants.

170
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:50,832
Now, hang on.

171
00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:52,670
Aah!

172
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,540
There.

173
00:20:57,842 --> 00:21:00,003
Jimmy, camera on the action.

174
00:21:06,951 --> 00:21:08,077
Oh, man, he can jump!

175
00:21:18,696 --> 00:21:19,924
Aah!

176
00:22:03,441 --> 00:22:05,170
Thanks, Superman.

177
00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:14,209
Get out of here. Now.

178
00:22:14,385 --> 00:22:15,511
Superman, don't...

179
00:22:16,654 --> 00:22:18,519
It's why I'm here.

180
00:24:24,448 --> 00:24:27,178
I've never seen Superman
take such a pounding.

181
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:28,784
Not that he can't dish it.

182
00:24:48,139 --> 00:24:50,869
<i>For those just
joining us, Metropolis is the scene...</i>

183
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:52,770
<i>...of widespread destruction
this morning...</i>

184
00:24:52,943 --> 00:24:55,810
<i>...as Superman attempts to overpower
a creature responsible...</i>

185
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,311
<i>...for a string of grisly murders.</i>

186
00:24:57,882 --> 00:25:01,511
<i>But as of right now, it's uncertain
which way the tide will turn.</i>

187
00:25:35,853 --> 00:25:37,684
Lois, do you think Superman's o...?

188
00:25:38,322 --> 00:25:40,256
Camera on the action, Jimmy.

189
00:27:19,823 --> 00:27:21,654
Superman.

190
00:27:32,936 --> 00:27:34,403
Is everyone?

191
00:27:34,938 --> 00:27:39,568
You did it, Superman.
We're safe, all of us.

192
00:27:40,844 --> 00:27:43,608
Good. That's...

193
00:27:43,781 --> 00:27:47,581
That's all that matters.

194
00:27:49,653 --> 00:27:50,847
Clark.

195
00:28:44,942 --> 00:28:48,070
Superman died as he lived...

196
00:28:48,612 --> 00:28:51,274
...defending Metropolis.

197
00:28:51,448 --> 00:28:54,212
He may have come
from another world...

198
00:28:55,018 --> 00:28:58,613
...but he will always belong to ours.

199
00:29:22,146 --> 00:29:23,773
James Olsen?

200
00:29:23,947 --> 00:29:26,245
Your photos of the tragedy were...

201
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:28,408
Well, words fail.

202
00:29:28,585 --> 00:29:32,681
It must have been hard for you,
being Superman's pal, I mean.

203
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:34,289
If you ever need to talk.

204
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:01,578
What is he doing here?

205
00:30:01,752 --> 00:30:04,550
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's somehow responsible.

206
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:06,848
Luthor doesn't matter right now.

207
00:30:07,024 --> 00:30:09,015
Come on, Lois.

208
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,151
Today, Superman's funeral was viewed...

209
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:14,661
...by hundreds of millions worldwide.

210
00:30:14,832 --> 00:30:19,030
Not since President Kennedy died
has our nation so collectively mourned.

211
00:30:19,203 --> 00:30:22,969
Yet it is the people of Metropolis
who are feeling the loss most...

212
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,074
...as we knew him best.

213
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:29,076
So let us take a brief moment
to celebrate his time with us.

214
00:30:29,246 --> 00:30:32,443
<i>Last year for Halloween,
I dressed like Superman.</i>

215
00:30:32,616 --> 00:30:36,416
<i>Now I'm gonna do it every year
for the rest of my life.</i>

216
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:40,853
<i>I was installing a satellite dish when
I slipped off the roof, three stories.</i>

217
00:30:41,024 --> 00:30:42,924
<i>I should have been a goner.
But out of nowhere...</i>

218
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:46,654
<i>...everyone's guardian angel
was suddenly mine too.</i>

219
00:30:51,301 --> 00:30:52,734
Not a word from Kent.

220
00:30:52,903 --> 00:30:55,736
He hasn't called, hasn't e-mailed.

221
00:30:55,906 --> 00:30:58,636
Clark isn't coming back.

222
00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:02,074
It's Afghanistan, chief.
People die there every day.

223
00:31:02,246 --> 00:31:05,704
Look, Lane, Kent's fine.
Just lost in the trenches.

224
00:31:05,883 --> 00:31:08,078
You know how he disappears
into his work.

225
00:31:08,552 --> 00:31:12,283
What are you doing here anyway?
I told you to take time off.

226
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:15,789
And do what?
I'm trying to keep myself occupied.

227
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:18,928
Well, occupy yourself
with friends or family.

228
00:31:19,096 --> 00:31:21,587
You must have someone
you can talk to.

229
00:31:37,915 --> 00:31:40,315
- Yes?
- Mrs. Kent?

230
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:42,145
I'm Lois Lane.

231
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,311
<i>- From the Daily Pl...
- I know who you are, Miss Lane.</i>

232
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:48,117
My son talks about you quite often.

233
00:31:48,292 --> 00:31:50,283
He's the reason I've come to see you.

234
00:31:50,928 --> 00:31:53,089
Has there been word
from Afghanistan?

235
00:31:53,263 --> 00:31:55,561
I've been...
Well, I have been so worried.

236
00:31:55,732 --> 00:31:57,461
Mrs. Kent...

237
00:31:57,634 --> 00:32:00,933
...you know as well as I do
that your son...

238
00:32:02,072 --> 00:32:04,233
...died in Metropolis last week.

239
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:09,242
- Look, I'm not here as a reporter. I...
- Then why are you here, Miss Lane?

240
00:32:09,413 --> 00:32:12,439
I don't know exactly.

241
00:32:12,616 --> 00:32:15,107
Maybe it's just...

242
00:32:15,285 --> 00:32:17,879
I don't know if he told you,
but we had been seeing each other...

243
00:32:18,055 --> 00:32:21,650
...for the past few months,
romantically, I mean.

244
00:32:21,825 --> 00:32:24,316
And I know the rest
of the world adored him...

245
00:32:24,494 --> 00:32:26,018
...and misses him
now that he's gone...

246
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:29,029
...but no one else
on this whole stupid planet...

247
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:35,263
...can know what it felt like to
really love him, to be loved by him...

248
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:36,565
...or how it feels now...

249
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:40,972
...every minute of every day,
like I'm broken.

250
00:32:41,144 --> 00:32:46,548
Like I'm the one
that freaking monster pounded on.

251
00:32:54,524 --> 00:32:59,325
You know, I was just about
to put on a fresh pot of coffee.

252
00:32:59,496 --> 00:33:01,123
You look like
you could use a cup.

253
00:33:01,665 --> 00:33:04,793
God, yes. Thank you.

254
00:33:14,378 --> 00:33:15,504
<i>As feared...</i>

255
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,613
<i>...crime rates have soared
in the past weeks.</i>

256
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:19,408
<i>Criminals have become more daring...</i>

257
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:22,711
<i>...and Metropolis P.D. Remains
understaffed and underfunded.</i>

258
00:33:22,886 --> 00:33:23,875
On the bright side...

259
00:33:24,054 --> 00:33:26,716
...technologies mogul
and philanthropist Lex Luthor...

260
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:30,587
...contributed $ 10 million
to the police department earlier today.

261
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:34,219
But ultimately, Metropolis
is faced with a stark reality...

262
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:36,730
...that no police force,
no matter how well-equipped...

263
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,528
<i>...will ever be as omnipresent
as one man:</i>

264
00:33:48,712 --> 00:33:50,577
You've made the right decision, James.

265
00:33:50,747 --> 00:33:54,547
<i>We at the National voyeur feel
there's enough misery in the world today.</i>

266
00:33:54,718 --> 00:33:56,413
Why rub people's noses in it?

267
00:33:56,586 --> 00:33:58,679
We're in the business
of entertainment, Mr. Swank.

268
00:33:58,855 --> 00:34:00,755
And making money, James.

269
00:34:01,692 --> 00:34:04,422
Please, call me Jimmy.

270
00:34:04,594 --> 00:34:05,754
Jimmy gave notice?

271
00:34:06,096 --> 00:34:11,090
What notice? Little ingrate up and left.
Working for that tabloid rag.

272
00:34:11,268 --> 00:34:12,701
But why would he...?

273
00:34:15,772 --> 00:34:18,866
Look, chief, this has been hard
on all of us, Jimmy included.

274
00:34:19,042 --> 00:34:22,773
I'm sure this is just his way
of trying to, you know, heal.

275
00:34:22,946 --> 00:34:26,347
Don't sugarcoat it, Lane.
Olsen's weak.

276
00:34:26,516 --> 00:34:29,041
He isn't man enough
to keep a grip on his ideals.

277
00:34:32,723 --> 00:34:37,660
Easy enough to lose sight of, I suppose,
in a world without Superman.

278
00:34:38,228 --> 00:34:42,665
Which reminds me, you rode shotgun
with Metro P.D. On that sleeper cell raid.

279
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,431
Kind of risky, don't you think?

280
00:34:44,601 --> 00:34:47,161
No more than usual, chief.
Why should things be any different?

281
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:51,330
Because he isn't here to pull your ass
out of the fire anymore, that's why.

282
00:34:52,476 --> 00:34:54,808
Be careful, Lane.

283
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,313
Taken before his time.

284
00:35:02,486 --> 00:35:05,080
So completely...

285
00:35:05,255 --> 00:35:08,315
...absurdly random.

286
00:35:08,492 --> 00:35:11,825
Come on, Lex. I figured
you'd be stoked he's finally gone.

287
00:35:11,995 --> 00:35:13,292
Isn't this what you wanted?

288
00:35:13,463 --> 00:35:16,125
I wanted a winning strategy.

289
00:35:16,299 --> 00:35:20,395
Instead, I've been cheated of the victory
I've planned for years...

290
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:23,539
...by an intergalactic soccer hooligan.

291
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:26,107
Your scientists found the hooligan.

292
00:35:26,276 --> 00:35:27,971
Speaking of which...

293
00:35:28,478 --> 00:35:30,969
...you did see to it that little mess
was cleaned up?

294
00:35:31,148 --> 00:35:34,140
LexCorp was never there.

295
00:35:39,156 --> 00:35:41,681
And neither were you.

296
00:36:03,346 --> 00:36:05,837
Toyman doesn't feel like sharing.

297
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:08,644
The goodies are mine, mine, mine.

298
00:36:11,521 --> 00:36:15,457
All you action figures
and your accessories better back off...

299
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:20,729
...or the kiddies are coming down
the hard way, ker-splat!

300
00:36:22,966 --> 00:36:24,456
Are you suicidal?

301
00:36:24,634 --> 00:36:26,864
We're supposed to report news,
not make it.

302
00:36:27,037 --> 00:36:29,528
Forget the news.
Those kids are gonna die.

303
00:36:34,744 --> 00:36:39,613
That's it, ta-ta.
We'll play again another day.

304
00:36:49,726 --> 00:36:50,886
It's okay.

305
00:37:07,878 --> 00:37:09,209
Come on.

306
00:37:18,755 --> 00:37:20,814
It's safe now.

307
00:37:22,092 --> 00:37:23,821
It's okay.

308
00:37:25,195 --> 00:37:26,423
Wha...?

309
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,761
My play dates.

310
00:37:40,277 --> 00:37:42,768
Fun time's over!

311
00:37:59,262 --> 00:38:02,356
School's out forever!

312
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:25,918
Your stop. Be right back.

313
00:38:30,026 --> 00:38:31,118
Superman's back?

314
00:38:32,162 --> 00:38:33,789
You? But you're...

315
00:38:33,964 --> 00:38:35,295
Taking you in, Toyman.

316
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:37,929
Giddyup!

317
00:38:49,846 --> 00:38:52,406
Aah!

318
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:07,325
Pfft. Like we really needed him
to bust up a mechanical spider, right?

319
00:39:07,497 --> 00:39:09,192
Lame.

320
00:39:12,469 --> 00:39:16,269
Um, thank you, Superman.

321
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:18,202
It's why I'm here.

322
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:31,583
It's really me, Lois.

323
00:39:32,188 --> 00:39:33,212
I'm back.

324
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:36,325
I can see that, feel that.

325
00:39:36,493 --> 00:39:37,517
But how?

326
00:39:37,694 --> 00:39:40,720
I awoke in darkness.

327
00:39:40,897 --> 00:39:42,990
The last thing I remember
before that is...

328
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:46,067
You're here, unless I'm dreaming.

329
00:39:46,236 --> 00:39:47,533
That's all that matters.

330
00:39:47,704 --> 00:39:48,932
Oh, you missed it.

331
00:40:00,216 --> 00:40:02,116
Here you go.

332
00:40:03,186 --> 00:40:05,677
Oh... Mm.

333
00:40:06,923 --> 00:40:09,949
You are glad to see me?

334
00:40:10,126 --> 00:40:12,924
Of course, Lois. It's just...

335
00:40:13,096 --> 00:40:14,654
I may need time to re-acclimate.

336
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:17,061
I did just come back
from the grave, you know.

337
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:18,891
Of course.

338
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:22,033
So see you soon?

339
00:40:22,205 --> 00:40:23,968
Yeah. Soon.

340
00:40:34,951 --> 00:40:38,717
We will soon commence
renovation of Superman Memorial Park...

341
00:40:38,888 --> 00:40:41,322
...to celebrate
the occasion of his return.

342
00:40:41,491 --> 00:40:42,856
There's work to be done.

343
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:45,085
<i>But I will make the streets
of Metropolis safe again.</i>

344
00:40:46,796 --> 00:40:48,957
It's a miracle.

345
00:40:49,132 --> 00:40:50,622
A miracle.

346
00:40:55,672 --> 00:40:57,196
Can you believe Superman's back?

347
00:40:57,373 --> 00:41:00,968
He'll whip this city back to shape.
I thought Superman wasn't dead.

348
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:14,546
Luthor.

349
00:41:16,893 --> 00:41:19,384
<i>Over here, Superman.</i>

350
00:41:25,535 --> 00:41:27,366
<i>Warm.</i>

351
00:41:32,342 --> 00:41:34,401
<i>Warmer.</i>

352
00:41:35,979 --> 00:41:39,574
<i>If you're wondering why you can't
see through these walls, Superman...</i>

353
00:41:39,749 --> 00:41:41,341
<i>...they're lined with lead.</i>

354
00:41:55,398 --> 00:42:00,631
My rumpus room also comes equipped
with red solar lamps...

355
00:42:00,803 --> 00:42:04,534
...and, of course, kryptonite.

356
00:42:05,175 --> 00:42:08,201
Red and green,
the colors of Christmas.

357
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:14,106
And you are on the naughty list!

358
00:42:14,584 --> 00:42:16,449
Why did you leave me?

359
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:18,143
Why?

360
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:26,224
We had so much unfinished business.

361
00:42:39,609 --> 00:42:41,907
Who's your daddy?

362
00:42:42,078 --> 00:42:48,074
By the way, you're doing a fine job
of convincing the world you're Superman.

363
00:42:48,251 --> 00:42:50,446
Keep up the good work.

364
00:43:01,431 --> 00:43:03,126
I've done it, Superman.

365
00:43:03,299 --> 00:43:05,290
Achieved the unimaginable.

366
00:43:05,635 --> 00:43:09,571
Sculpted your clone with a strand
of DNA from a fleck of blood...

367
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:12,799
...swabbed from the scene
of your epic final battle.

368
00:43:12,976 --> 00:43:18,937
Your doppelgänger possesses all of
your speed, strength, morality even.

369
00:43:19,115 --> 00:43:21,015
But not your mind.

370
00:43:21,184 --> 00:43:23,778
Only knows what
I've programmed him to know...

371
00:43:23,953 --> 00:43:27,081
...since you took your secrets
to the proverbial grave.

372
00:43:27,257 --> 00:43:29,487
But why should I complain?

373
00:43:29,659 --> 00:43:33,720
My super-powered sycophant
bows to my every whim.

374
00:43:33,896 --> 00:43:38,595
Even tunneled all the way to Memorial Park
to pluck you from your resting place.

375
00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:44,431
A bit ghoulish, I know,
but necessary to stage your coming out.

376
00:43:44,841 --> 00:43:48,470
I resented being cheated
out of orchestrating your destruction...

377
00:43:48,645 --> 00:43:49,669
...but I'm over it.

378
00:43:49,846 --> 00:43:53,782
In fact, this whole miserable experience
has only made me stronger.

379
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:56,282
Put me back in touch with my roots.

380
00:43:56,853 --> 00:44:02,257
So now that you no longer stand
in the way of my plans, Superman...

381
00:44:02,425 --> 00:44:04,791
...you shall help me to achieve them.

382
00:44:24,714 --> 00:44:27,649
Lane. Martha, hi.

383
00:44:27,817 --> 00:44:30,980
Clark still hasn't visited.
Hasn't even phoned.

384
00:44:31,287 --> 00:44:34,916
He... He's a little preoccupied
here in Bigville.

385
00:44:35,091 --> 00:44:36,718
You know, making up for lost time.

386
00:44:36,893 --> 00:44:38,884
Well, you see him, don't you?

387
00:44:39,462 --> 00:44:41,726
Not as much as I'd like.

388
00:44:55,978 --> 00:44:59,675
So this is what a potential Pulitzer
Prize winner does for a second act?

389
00:44:59,849 --> 00:45:02,079
Lois, hey.

390
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:04,879
Don't think they'll let you past
the ropes wearing that.

391
00:45:05,054 --> 00:45:06,112
Ow, ow, ow!

392
00:45:06,422 --> 00:45:09,949
I'm not here to go clubbing, Jimmy.
I'm here to talk.

393
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:17,996
Lois, I'm working here.

394
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:19,794
Jimmy, look at you.

395
00:45:20,036 --> 00:45:21,833
Italian silk.

396
00:45:22,004 --> 00:45:23,801
<i>You're underpaid at the Planet,
you know.</i>

397
00:45:23,973 --> 00:45:28,307
I meant I'm not sure
I like what you think you've become.

398
00:45:28,811 --> 00:45:32,144
Ha-ha, speaking of changes,
how about the big S, huh?

399
00:45:32,315 --> 00:45:36,479
Ever consider the big S
may not be what he seems?

400
00:45:36,886 --> 00:45:38,945
He wears red and blue, flies...

401
00:45:39,122 --> 00:45:42,819
...crime rate's plummeted
since he's risen from the grave.

402
00:45:42,992 --> 00:45:44,482
Gosh, you think he's a zombie?

403
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,491
I'm not sure what he is.

404
00:45:46,662 --> 00:45:49,324
Call it reporter's nose
or woman's intuition, but...

405
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:51,160
Whoa, you're not serious?

406
00:45:51,334 --> 00:45:53,268
Why wouldn't you think
he's really Superman?

407
00:45:57,507 --> 00:46:00,101
Okay, weird.
But it doesn't mean he's...

408
00:46:00,276 --> 00:46:03,643
- I need to know the truth.
- And you could use my help.

409
00:46:03,813 --> 00:46:06,281
Come on, Jimmy,
for old time's sake?

410
00:46:10,453 --> 00:46:13,786
I've moved on, Lois.
I like my life the way it is now.

411
00:46:13,956 --> 00:46:16,254
I like it just fine.

412
00:46:21,397 --> 00:46:23,365
And how was your day, Superman?

413
00:46:23,533 --> 00:46:24,864
Save any lives?

414
00:46:31,674 --> 00:46:35,166
A 19-second blackout at 3:47 a. m.

415
00:46:37,747 --> 00:46:39,612
Had to be an EMP.

416
00:46:40,783 --> 00:46:44,480
But you didn't get up
and walk away, Superman.

417
00:46:44,654 --> 00:46:46,451
Where the hell are you?

418
00:47:12,014 --> 00:47:14,482
<i>Winslow P. Schott, a. k. a. Toyman...</i>

419
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:16,481
<i>...escaped from prison
early this morning...</i>

420
00:47:16,652 --> 00:47:20,383
<i>...and proceeded to hold several children
hostage at a daycare center.</i>

421
00:47:20,556 --> 00:47:21,989
<i>After a prolonged standoff...</i>

422
00:47:22,158 --> 00:47:25,218
<i>...the fugitive was apprehended
by police just moments ago.</i>

423
00:47:25,428 --> 00:47:28,226
<i>But though Toyman is now safely
in police custody...</i>

424
00:47:28,431 --> 00:47:30,558
<i>...there is a tragic element
to the scene.</i>

425
00:47:30,733 --> 00:47:34,897
<i>Minutes before his capture,
Toyman took the life of young Katy Alpert.</i>

426
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:37,738
<i>She was only 4 years old.</i>

427
00:47:46,616 --> 00:47:49,551
I'm alive?

428
00:47:49,719 --> 00:47:51,346
It would seem that on this world...

429
00:47:51,521 --> 00:47:54,217
...the laws of human death
do not apply to you, Kal-El.

430
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:58,456
I only came to realize it 17 days
after your apparent demise...

431
00:47:58,628 --> 00:48:01,791
...when I was alerted to a single pulse
of your biorhythmic signature.

432
00:48:02,131 --> 00:48:07,159
So my vitals slowed to a crawl...

433
00:48:07,336 --> 00:48:09,065
To better enable you to heal.

434
00:48:09,438 --> 00:48:13,374
I had to await a second pulse,
17 days later, in order to find you...

435
00:48:13,543 --> 00:48:16,307
...once I discovered
your body had been relocated.

436
00:48:16,479 --> 00:48:17,639
Relocated?

437
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,413
To LexCorp.

438
00:48:19,582 --> 00:48:22,312
It would appear
that Lex Luthor has cloned you.

439
00:48:22,485 --> 00:48:25,249
I need to get back to Metropolis.

440
00:48:25,421 --> 00:48:27,150
Once you have regained your strength.

441
00:48:27,456 --> 00:48:29,390
I am uncertain
of your double's agenda...

442
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:32,494
...but for now, he seems to be
protecting Metropolis.

443
00:48:48,678 --> 00:48:51,579
Pardon me, officers.
I need a moment with your prisoner.

444
00:48:51,747 --> 00:48:53,840
What? Why, you can't...

445
00:48:54,183 --> 00:48:56,777
Uh, is that allowed?

446
00:48:58,854 --> 00:49:00,048
I have rights.

447
00:49:00,222 --> 00:49:02,122
I have nothing to say to you.

448
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,687
How about goodbye?

449
00:49:15,237 --> 00:49:17,535
Did he just drop him?

450
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,686
Lane. He did what?

451
00:49:35,691 --> 00:49:38,683
Excuse me, coming through.
Move it!

452
00:50:07,556 --> 00:50:10,116
<i>Over here. Over here, Superman.</i>

453
00:50:10,292 --> 00:50:11,919
<i>Superman, what made you do it?</i>

454
00:50:12,094 --> 00:50:15,325
<i>Toyman would have killed again.
An example needed to be set.</i>

455
00:50:15,498 --> 00:50:17,557
<i>But you've never done anything
like this in the past.</i>

456
00:50:17,733 --> 00:50:19,223
<i>I see things differently now.</i>

457
00:50:19,402 --> 00:50:22,496
<i>- But what about the law?
Won't there be repercussions?</i>

458
00:50:22,672 --> 00:50:26,904
<i>I consider myself the authority
on what's best for Metropolis, don't you?</i>

459
00:50:27,743 --> 00:50:30,337
That is not the boy I raised.

460
00:50:32,148 --> 00:50:34,343
Precious, come down here.

461
00:50:36,185 --> 00:50:37,846
Precious.

462
00:50:39,722 --> 00:50:41,349
Got her, ma'am.

463
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:46,692
Now, you know, Persian Longhairs
really shouldn't be outdoors.

464
00:50:46,862 --> 00:50:49,353
Please, Precious didn't mean it.

465
00:50:49,532 --> 00:50:51,523
Oh, my beef isn't with the kitty.

466
00:50:51,701 --> 00:50:55,432
It really irks me when folks don't take
responsibility for the little things.

467
00:50:56,706 --> 00:50:59,539
Don't get me wrong,
I'm here to help.

468
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:02,676
But every time I have to stop
and sweat the small stuff...

469
00:51:02,845 --> 00:51:05,780
...it potentially keeps me
from attending to more urgent matters.

470
00:51:08,084 --> 00:51:09,711
Life-threatening matters.

471
00:51:13,956 --> 00:51:16,789
You may wanna think about that
next time you leave the screen door open.

472
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:19,953
I will. I... I promise, thank you.

473
00:51:25,601 --> 00:51:27,899
The commissioner
would like a word with you, Superman.

474
00:51:28,771 --> 00:51:32,468
As I was just explaining to the lady,
I'm a little busy right now.

475
00:51:32,641 --> 00:51:35,633
We've been instructed
to escort you, if necessary.

476
00:51:36,645 --> 00:51:38,203
Really?

477
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,521
- Son of a...!
- Watch the language.

478
00:52:01,637 --> 00:52:03,161
Solar boosters at maximum.

479
00:52:06,342 --> 00:52:09,311
Your metabolism
has spiked exponentially, Kal-El.

480
00:52:09,478 --> 00:52:14,381
We must continue your accelerated
absorption of yellow solar energy.

481
00:52:16,118 --> 00:52:19,849
Well, the prodigal son of Krypton.

482
00:52:20,289 --> 00:52:23,690
You've been acting a tad
out of character, wouldn't you say?

483
00:52:23,859 --> 00:52:26,123
Protecting Metropolis
is out of character?

484
00:52:26,295 --> 00:52:29,628
It is when you make the streets
run red with blood.

485
00:52:31,634 --> 00:52:34,865
I put you on Earth
to attend to my dirty work.

486
00:52:35,037 --> 00:52:36,163
Here.

487
00:52:36,338 --> 00:52:38,533
A hot list of LexCorp's competitors.

488
00:52:38,707 --> 00:52:42,973
All with motive to steal Superman's corpse
for scientific gain.

489
00:52:43,145 --> 00:52:45,375
Retrieve the body immediately...

490
00:52:45,548 --> 00:52:47,482
...and discreetly.

491
00:52:48,517 --> 00:52:51,611
Remember,
I brought you into this world.

492
00:52:51,787 --> 00:52:54,381
I can take you out of it.

493
00:52:59,395 --> 00:53:01,829
That's what I said, right?

494
00:53:35,264 --> 00:53:37,095
Ladies.

495
00:53:55,417 --> 00:53:57,715
Mm, lead.

496
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:02,051
Only one thing it could be hiding,
kryptonite.

497
00:54:27,616 --> 00:54:31,052
A safe Superman
means a safe Metropolis.

498
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:36,687
Evening, Lex.

499
00:54:36,859 --> 00:54:37,985
Lois Lane.

500
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,185
- How did you...?
- Get past security?

501
00:54:40,362 --> 00:54:42,159
It's what I do.

502
00:54:43,032 --> 00:54:47,128
Forgive the indelicacy, Lois,
but you look terrible.

503
00:54:47,303 --> 00:54:49,100
There's breaking news.

504
00:54:49,405 --> 00:54:53,102
Looks like you won, Lex.
You finally won.

505
00:54:53,275 --> 00:54:55,266
I'm not sure I know
what you're talking about.

506
00:54:55,444 --> 00:54:56,706
How'd you do it?

507
00:54:56,879 --> 00:54:59,507
How did you make Superman
your puppet?

508
00:54:59,682 --> 00:55:02,344
Really, Lois,
these insinuations of yours are...

509
00:55:02,518 --> 00:55:05,578
Relax. I don't plan on writing
any more exposés.

510
00:55:05,754 --> 00:55:09,121
<i>I'm tired, quitting the Planet,
leaving Metropolis.</i>

511
00:55:09,291 --> 00:55:12,988
But before I go,
I need to know how you did it.

512
00:55:13,162 --> 00:55:16,654
What you did to him...

513
00:55:16,832 --> 00:55:19,460
...so I can move on with my life.

514
00:55:20,903 --> 00:55:23,531
You were more than friends.

515
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:31,943
He was more than
your constant rescuer.

516
00:55:34,683 --> 00:55:37,481
You must be terribly lonesome
without him.

517
00:55:39,321 --> 00:55:40,310
Yes.

518
00:55:41,957 --> 00:55:45,051
Then you need someone
to take his place.

519
00:55:47,196 --> 00:55:50,029
Someone big and strong.

520
00:56:14,289 --> 00:56:16,018
We have 30 minutes,
we need to work fast.

521
00:56:16,191 --> 00:56:17,522
Don't forget your camera.

522
00:57:05,174 --> 00:57:07,904
You know, I'm supposed to be covering
a celebrity rave right now.

523
00:57:08,077 --> 00:57:09,738
Save it. We're here.

524
00:57:15,184 --> 00:57:17,152
Great. Retinal scanner.

525
00:57:17,319 --> 00:57:19,150
Now what?

526
00:57:53,422 --> 00:57:55,890
Ugh. Yummy.

527
00:57:58,127 --> 00:58:01,893
- A freaking circus sideshow.
Jimmy.

528
00:58:08,871 --> 00:58:09,997
Superman?

529
00:58:10,172 --> 00:58:11,571
Supermen.

530
00:58:12,441 --> 00:58:15,740
He's harvesting Supermen.

531
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:18,842
So you were right.

532
00:58:19,014 --> 00:58:20,606
The Superman who returned...

533
00:58:20,782 --> 00:58:22,875
A clone. A fake.

534
00:58:23,051 --> 00:58:25,451
Which means
the real Superman really is...

535
00:58:25,621 --> 00:58:27,179
Yes, Jimmy.

536
00:58:28,357 --> 00:58:32,259
Dead. Just as you and Ms. Lane
are about to be.

537
00:58:35,097 --> 00:58:39,864
Because after all,
there is no Superman to save you.

538
00:58:40,269 --> 00:58:43,602
They are genetically bred
to do my bidding.

539
00:58:43,972 --> 00:58:49,433
Imagine, an army of Supermen
policing the skies of Metropolis.

540
00:58:49,711 --> 00:58:54,205
The world
upholding the law of Luthor.

541
00:59:00,789 --> 00:59:04,384
Clearly, some fine-tuning is required.

542
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:08,690
On the bright side,
I get to kill Superman after all.

543
00:59:20,042 --> 00:59:21,100
Oh, hell.

544
00:59:27,783 --> 00:59:30,718
Evil Supermen? Not on my watch.

545
00:59:38,227 --> 00:59:39,956
Aah!

546
01:00:18,734 --> 01:00:21,225
Evacuate the premises.

547
01:00:38,487 --> 01:00:42,719
Superman,
you've been a very, very bad boy.

548
01:00:42,891 --> 01:00:45,485
I might have to mess up
that pretty face of yours.

549
01:00:45,894 --> 01:00:49,728
That's it, come to papa.

550
01:01:17,659 --> 01:01:19,684
What's he doing?

551
01:01:22,364 --> 01:01:26,198
You're a menace to society, Luthor.
You won't be missed.

552
01:01:44,586 --> 01:01:45,951
Come on.

553
01:01:54,796 --> 01:01:57,128
An alert from Metropolis.

554
01:01:57,399 --> 01:01:59,230
<i>The saga of Superman's return...</i>

555
01:01:59,401 --> 01:02:01,062
<i>...just took another bizarre twist...</i>

556
01:02:01,236 --> 01:02:06,105
<i>...as the Man of Steel allegedly adds tech
mogul Lex Luthor to his recent hit list.</i>

557
01:02:06,274 --> 01:02:09,505
<i>The president has declared
a state of emergency in Metropolis...</i>

558
01:02:09,678 --> 01:02:12,169
<i>...and is considering military action.</i>

559
01:02:12,347 --> 01:02:15,043
<i>Army reserves are mobilizing,
but there is no telling...</i>

560
01:02:15,217 --> 01:02:18,778
<i>...how Superman will respond
to a show of force.</i>

561
01:02:19,187 --> 01:02:22,281
But, Kal-El,
you are only at 67 percent strength.

562
01:02:23,358 --> 01:02:25,121
It'll have to do.

563
01:02:46,348 --> 01:02:48,782
Kal-El, your double outmatches you.

564
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:51,180
You will need a leading edge
to defeat him.

565
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:53,082
Solar suit.

566
01:02:53,255 --> 01:02:55,849
To help absorb yellow sun rays
during my flight there.

567
01:02:56,024 --> 01:02:59,016
I had something
even more practical in mind.

568
01:02:59,194 --> 01:03:00,422
Luthor's kryptonite cannon?

569
01:03:00,595 --> 01:03:01,960
From the archives.

570
01:03:02,264 --> 01:03:05,529
The kryptonite is safely ensconced
in a lead-lined cartridge.

571
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:08,464
Properly utilized,
it will weaken your opponent...

572
01:03:08,637 --> 01:03:11,197
...and even the playing field.

573
01:03:47,976 --> 01:03:51,468
This is insane.
We can't kill Superman.

574
01:03:51,646 --> 01:03:54,240
You're right.
We can't kill Superman.

575
01:03:54,416 --> 01:03:55,644
Dead men walking.

576
01:03:56,718 --> 01:03:59,983
Superman,
I have to ask you to step down.

577
01:04:00,155 --> 01:04:03,124
I don't think that
would be in the city's best interests.

578
01:04:03,558 --> 01:04:05,150
You leave us no choice.

579
01:04:13,668 --> 01:04:16,466
I'm only doing this because I care.

580
01:04:27,015 --> 01:04:29,575
Fall back, fall back!

581
01:05:18,033 --> 01:05:19,398
Lois?

582
01:05:36,384 --> 01:05:37,681
Look who's back.

583
01:05:43,892 --> 01:05:44,984
Who's the rocker?

584
01:05:45,927 --> 01:05:48,088
- You don't think?
- I don't know.

585
01:05:48,263 --> 01:05:49,992
He's wearing Superman's shield.

586
01:05:50,165 --> 01:05:51,598
He's also wearing black.

587
01:05:52,133 --> 01:05:55,762
Great. Bad Superman
and badder Superman.

588
01:05:55,937 --> 01:05:58,167
Metropolis is doing just fine without you.

589
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:00,331
I'm not sure
I approve of your methods.

590
01:06:00,508 --> 01:06:03,068
I'm not asking for your approval.

591
01:06:03,244 --> 01:06:05,337
Get this straight,
you're not needed here.

592
01:06:05,513 --> 01:06:09,108
Metropolis is under my protection,
now and forever.

593
01:06:10,685 --> 01:06:12,778
Over my dead body.

594
01:06:17,425 --> 01:06:18,983
Was that a kryptonite gun?

595
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,025
Not very Superman-like.

596
01:06:54,162 --> 01:06:56,027
Come on.
Uh, I'll wait here.

597
01:06:56,197 --> 01:06:58,358
Oh, for God's sake,
don't be such a girl.

598
01:07:04,572 --> 01:07:05,903
Whew.

599
01:07:22,123 --> 01:07:23,750
Aah!

600
01:07:47,248 --> 01:07:49,375
- Who's the man in black?
- Who cares?

601
01:07:49,551 --> 01:07:52,486
He's kicking Superman's ass.

602
01:08:23,084 --> 01:08:24,608
This is starting to look familiar.

603
01:08:24,953 --> 01:08:27,751
Yeah, only I'm in no mood
for another funeral.

604
01:08:28,923 --> 01:08:30,481
Whoa!

605
01:09:25,914 --> 01:09:27,074
You're out of shape.

606
01:09:27,582 --> 01:09:30,210
Do tell.

607
01:09:47,969 --> 01:09:50,494
Wow. That almost hurt.

608
01:09:52,173 --> 01:09:54,038
Look, why prolong this?

609
01:09:54,209 --> 01:09:56,439
I could keep this up all day,
but you...

610
01:09:56,611 --> 01:09:58,841
Why not fly on out of here
while you still can?

611
01:09:59,013 --> 01:10:01,743
And leave the city in your hands?
Not likely.

612
01:10:01,916 --> 01:10:03,611
But don't you get it?

613
01:10:03,785 --> 01:10:05,582
I am you, Superman.

614
01:10:05,753 --> 01:10:08,415
A reflection of you
as you might have been.

615
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:10,751
If I were raised by Luthor?

616
01:10:10,925 --> 01:10:12,756
If you were strong.

617
01:10:12,927 --> 01:10:18,194
You're self-righteous, misguided,
my reflection in a cracked mirror.

618
01:10:18,366 --> 01:10:20,266
Suit yourself.

619
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,699
What happened
to "camera on the action"?

620
01:10:27,876 --> 01:10:30,106
The story's that way. Whoa!

621
01:10:35,283 --> 01:10:36,875
Now it is.

622
01:10:56,971 --> 01:10:59,371
I guess this time I'll need to see to it
that you stay dead.

623
01:11:53,962 --> 01:11:57,796
Now tell me, who's better equipped
to protect Metropolis?

624
01:11:57,966 --> 01:11:59,695
You have all my strengths...

625
01:11:59,867 --> 01:12:01,630
...and my weaknesses.

626
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:37,460
Pro...

627
01:12:37,839 --> 01:12:39,397
Protect...

628
01:12:39,574 --> 01:12:41,405
Protect the people.

629
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:43,507
It's why I'm here.

630
01:12:49,484 --> 01:12:53,921
If you're a robot or another damn clone
or something, I swear to God...

631
01:12:54,088 --> 01:12:56,386
It's really me, Lois.

632
01:12:57,091 --> 01:12:58,524
I'm back.

633
01:12:58,693 --> 01:13:01,389
Like I haven't heard that before.

634
01:13:03,097 --> 01:13:05,031
I may need some proof.

635
01:13:13,674 --> 01:13:17,405
- Okay. I'm convinced.
- I'm glad.

636
01:13:18,846 --> 01:13:21,781
But I'm not sure
they'll ever trust me again.

637
01:13:23,117 --> 01:13:24,311
They will.

638
01:13:24,485 --> 01:13:26,817
It may take some time.

639
01:13:28,723 --> 01:13:30,918
Are you gonna wear
the red and blue suit again?

640
01:13:31,092 --> 01:13:32,491
Because I like that one better.

641
01:13:33,327 --> 01:13:35,488
Or not very much time at all.

642
01:13:50,711 --> 01:13:53,441
Mm. Do I smell coffee?

643
01:13:53,614 --> 01:13:56,742
Fresh pot. I'm almost done here.

644
01:13:57,285 --> 01:13:58,752
Mm...

645
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,478
There's only one S in resurrection.

646
01:14:00,655 --> 01:14:03,852
Didn't realize proofreading
was one of your super-powers.

647
01:14:04,025 --> 01:14:05,458
Well, no.

648
01:14:05,626 --> 01:14:09,289
But I was the spelling-bee champ
of Smallville Elementary.

649
01:14:12,433 --> 01:14:14,298
Clark.

650
01:14:19,907 --> 01:14:22,137
Don't forget to call your mother.

651
01:14:48,269 --> 01:14:52,296
<i>If history
has determined that gods can die...</i>

652
01:14:52,473 --> 01:14:57,342
<i>...it has also proven
that they may return from the dead.</i>

653
01:14:58,379 --> 01:15:03,112
<i>It would seem you can't be destroyed
after all, Superman.</i>

654
01:15:04,218 --> 01:15:06,812
<i>It would seem.</i>
