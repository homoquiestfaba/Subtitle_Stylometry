Gas grades aren't clear.

They're not clear?

197
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,369
They're not clear. I just
pumped 87 into my Beemer

198
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:02,564
because the markings are
all fucked-up and faded.

199

than an inconvenience.

luxury vehicle over there.

203
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:11,672
It should only sip 91 gas.

204
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,908
I want a full refund.

205
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:16,911
The gas is already in your car.

206
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:18,321
That is because
you are not running

207
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,756
a professional
business establishment.

208
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,215
I'm sorry, ma'am.

209
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:25,252
I can't give you a refund

211

What is that smell?

213
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:35,664
Oh, my God.

214
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:38,165
This place is
fucking disgusting.

215
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,301
There is no way this
place is up to code.

216
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:42,102
I am calling the
Better Business Bureau.

217
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:45,640
I'm gonna have this redneck
shithole place shut down.

218

What'd you say your name was?

219
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:48,776
I'll give you a refund.

220

[mocking] "Two to
three business days."

224
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:05,926
With an attitude like
that, that's gonna

225
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:08,162
get you a one-way ticket
to fucking nowhere.

226
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:13,033
Is it okay if I just...

227
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:15,570

Okay, my name is Emily Kasahara.

251
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:50,297
I've been drugged and kidnapped
by my ex, Charlie Bellwick.

252
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:53,233
I don't know where I am, but
I'm somewhere in the forest,

253
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:55,869
and I can't see anything
because I broke my glasses.

254
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,672
<i>Okay. Where is
the kidnapper now?</i>

255
00:13:57,772 --> 00:14:01,710
I don't know, but I heard him
yell my name, so he's close.

256
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,745
<i>Okay. Well, we're gonna
figure out where you are</i>

257

258
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:07,414
<i>Are location services
enabled on your phone?</i>

259
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:09,283
No. I thought that
he was using them

260
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:11,185

turned them off.

261
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:13,287

your number, so we can</i>

Could you video-call me and
guide me to somewhere safe?

<i>Unfortunately, we do not
have video capabilities,</i>

00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,392
Damn it. [sighs]

358
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,729
[pulsing, suspenseful
music plays]

359
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:08,382
[phone chimes]

360
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:13,121
<i>Oh, thank God. I got worried.</i>

361
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:15,523
Sorry. I, um, just
needed a second.

362
00:19:15,623 --> 00:19:17,224
<i>All right, I need to figure out</i>

363
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:20,160
which way to go, so can
you tell me what you see?

364
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,396
Trees. Yeah. Trees.
You're in a forest.

365
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:25,099
Okay. Uh, is there a
clearing in any direction?

366
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:28,569
Uh, uh, yeah, uh, to your left.

367
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,506
Uh, maybe it'll be
faster without the trees.

368
00:19:31,606 --> 00:19:33,675
<i>Great. All right, now, I
need you to look behind me</i>

369
00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:36,309
<i>and make sure he's
not there, okay?</i>

370
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:39,479
Okay. Uh...

371
00:19:44,986 --> 00:19:45,987
Wait. Stop.

372
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:47,689
[whispers] What was it?

373
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:50,958
I thought I saw something move.

374
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,292
[door opens, bell jingles]

375
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,227
I-I guess it was nothing.

376
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:55,997
<i>It was nothing.
It's just, um...</i>

377
00:19:56,097 --> 00:19:57,699
Okay, um, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

378
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,677
I, um... I should... I
should... I should probably call

379
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:01,679
someone else for you, because
I just... I just can't.

380
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:04,839
I can't. <i>No.
You're doing great.</i>

381
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:08,408
<i>Sam, I'm gonna need you to take
a deep breath for me, okay?</i>

382
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:11,478
<i>In... and out.</i>
[takes deep breath]

383
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:13,380
<i>Look, I-I know
that this is a lot,</i>

384
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,316
<i>but it's a miracle I got you.</i>

385
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:21,089
Miracle?

386
00:20:21,189 --> 00:20:22,824
<i>Yes.</i>

387
00:20:22,924 --> 00:20:24,491
A miracle.

388
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:28,495
Okay.

389
00:20:28,596 --> 00:20:30,765
<i>Can you do another 360?</i>

390
00:20:30,865 --> 00:20:33,366
Yes, I can.

391
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,337
<i>Which way, Sam? Which way?</i>

392
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:39,707
<i>Okay, stop.</i>

393
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,709
The clearing's to your right.

394
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:43,443
<i>Right. Okay. Any obstructions?</i>

395
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:46,214
Um, yeah, there's a-a
tree. Step to your left.

396
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:47,815
Good?

397
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:49,650
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

398
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:53,154
<i>Okay, you're at the field now.</i>

399
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:55,623
Great. What do you see?

400
00:20:55,723 --> 00:20:57,792
Is there a house?
Um, a landmark?

401
00:20:57,892 --> 00:21:00,728
<i>A road anywhere?</i> Uh...

402
00:21:00,828 --> 00:21:02,997
<i>Um... stop.</i>

403
00:21:03,097 --> 00:21:06,634
I think I see a-a
path across the field.

404
00:21:06,734 --> 00:21:09,704
Great. Okay, let's go. Let's go.

405
00:21:14,642 --> 00:21:16,082
<i>Um, there hasn't
been any sign of him</i>

406
00:21:16,177 --> 00:21:18,079
<i>for a while, which
is good, but, um...</i>

407
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:19,547
<i>I'll keep doing 360s in case,</i>

408
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:21,249
<i>and if you see him,
you just have to</i>

409
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:23,160
<i>give me a shout, okay, and
I'll just start running.</i>

410
00:21:23,184 --> 00:21:25,086
Oh, it sparkles.

411
00:21:25,186 --> 00:21:27,155
<i>And just make sure that
I don't trip on anything.</i>

412
00:21:27,255 --> 00:21:29,356
Hey, um, are you sure I can't

413
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:30,758
<i>call, uh, family or friend,</i>

414
00:21:30,858 --> 00:21:32,660
<i>have them call you back?</i> What?

415
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,163
<i>No. I haven't memorized a
number since middle school.</i>

416
00:21:35,263 --> 00:21:37,999
<i>Uh, it's just I'm at
work, and-and I am...</i>

417
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:41,334
I'm so not good
under stress, like...

418
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:43,104
<i>Can you see your own hands, Sam?</i>

419
00:21:43,204 --> 00:21:44,404
Yeah.

420
00:21:44,505 --> 00:21:46,040
Then you are
better-equipped than me.

421
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,608
Right, uh...

422
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,510
Please, listen. Um...

423
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,112
God, I'm so jealous.

424
00:21:51,212 --> 00:21:54,782
<i>Uh, I-I've had shit
eyes since I was a kid.</i>

425
00:21:54,882 --> 00:21:57,151
<i>Do you know what they used
to called me back then?</i>

426
00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:58,686
Four Eyes?

427
00:21:58,786 --> 00:22:03,291
Nope. They would scream
"Missu Golightulee" at me.

428
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,625
What's that?

429
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:06,359
Bullshit in <i>Breakfast
at Tiffany's.</i>

430
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:07,829
You never saw it?

431
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:10,631
White actor in yellow face
with the taped-back eyes

432
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:13,768
and, lucky for me, glasses.

433
00:22:13,868 --> 00:22:16,369
Yeah, yeah. I saw
clips on YouTube.

434
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:17,872
It's-it's horrible.

435
00:22:17,972 --> 00:22:21,542
Yeah, I begged my mom for
LASIK, but I was too young.

436
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:25,680
Then when I got older,
I chose not to get it,

437
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,915
thinking that
people would take me

438
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:30,551
more seriously as a doctor

439
00:22:30,651 --> 00:22:32,887
if I had glasses on.

440
00:22:34,055 --> 00:22:36,991
Pretty stupid decision
in hindsight, huh?

441
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,329
You know, when I was little,

442
00:22:41,428 --> 00:22:42,930
the kids playing Power Rangers,

443
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,701
they would make me
be Rita Repulsa.

444
00:22:46,801 --> 00:22:49,003
Oh, wait, is that the
evil lady with the staff?

445
00:22:49,103 --> 00:22:52,139
Yeah, and the nickname stuck
all the way through high school.

446
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,710
Repulsa was written all
over my senior yearbook.

447
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,212
God, kids can be such shit.

448
00:22:58,312 --> 00:22:59,580
Yeah.

449
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,583
But hey, uh, Rita
was, like, a...

450
00:23:02,683 --> 00:23:05,887
a badass space witch, right?

451
00:23:05,987 --> 00:23:07,822
Yeah. I guess.

452
00:23:07,922 --> 00:23:09,190
[yells in pain]

453
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,457
Are you okay?

454
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:13,094
Yeah, I'm fine.
Let's just, uh...

455
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:15,863
Are we near the path yet?

456
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:17,765
Oh, no.

457
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:19,333
What?

458
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:20,835
<i>I'm so sorry, Emily.</i>

459
00:23:20,935 --> 00:23:22,136
What is it?

460
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:24,939
<i>It's not a path.</i>

461
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,841
It's just a fallen tree.

462
00:23:26,941 --> 00:23:28,408
Oh, my God. I'm-I'm so sorry.

463
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:30,053
How could I have thought
that that was a path?

464
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:31,979
<i>What is... what is wrong
with me? I'm so sorry.</i>

465
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,115
[sighs] Nothing
is wrong with you.

466
00:23:34,215 --> 00:23:37,084
Okay? It's fine.
Let's just keep going.

467
00:23:37,184 --> 00:23:40,354
Okay, but what if... what if I
missed sending you a better way?

468
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:41,689
<i>You didn't lead me back</i>

469
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:43,057
to the cabin, did you?

470
00:23:43,157 --> 00:23:44,258
No, no, but I...

471
00:23:44,358 --> 00:23:46,794
Hey, it's okay. [sighs]

472
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:48,763
[Emily groans] What is it?

473
00:23:48,863 --> 00:23:52,099
My wrists are, uh, zip-tied,
and I'm losing circulation.

474
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:53,401
I got to get 'em off.

475
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:54,902
Zip-tied? Oh, my God.

476
00:23:55,002 --> 00:23:57,038
And I didn't... I
didn't even realize.

477
00:23:57,138 --> 00:23:58,606
Okay. Uh, hold on.

478
00:23:58,706 --> 00:24:00,174
Let me see.

479
00:24:00,274 --> 00:24:03,010
<i>Okay, I'm gonna stop for a
sec here, so you just have to</i>

480
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,248
check behind me to make sure
that he's not here, okay?

481
00:24:07,348 --> 00:24:09,317
<i>Oh, no.</i> What?

482
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:11,419
[whispers] Is he there?

483
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:13,120
<i>Did you see him?</i> What? Oh, no.

484
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,132
No, it's just my-my battery's
low, but don't worry.

485
00:24:15,156 --> 00:24:17,959
<i>Okay? I have a charger.</i>
Jesus. You scared me.

486
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,527
Sorry. I'm sorry.

487
00:24:19,627 --> 00:24:21,195
<i>My phone was fully charged</i>

488
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:23,097
<i>when I left for my
run this morning,</i>

489
00:24:23,197 --> 00:24:26,934
<i>but I have no idea how
much I have left now.</i>

490
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:28,336
[sighs] Damn it.

491
00:24:28,436 --> 00:24:30,438
Maybe if you find me,
like, a rock or something,

492
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:32,472
I could, uh...

493
00:24:32,573 --> 00:24:34,976
[man speaking
Russian over phone]

494
00:24:35,076 --> 00:24:35,843
Is that Russian?

495
00:24:35,943 --> 00:24:38,679
Uh, I think so. It's a video.

496
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:50,992
[bird cawing] [sighs]

497
00:24:52,793 --> 00:24:54,962
[cawing continues]

498
00:24:56,731 --> 00:24:58,833
I never imagined
getting murdered

499
00:24:58,933 --> 00:25:01,535
would feel so absurd.

500
00:25:02,636 --> 00:25:04,038
Hey, okay?

501
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:06,307
No one is getting
murdered today.

502
00:25:06,407 --> 00:25:07,842
Now, Sergei says

503
00:25:07,942 --> 00:25:10,344
you need to use your teeth
to tighten the zip ties.

504
00:25:10,444 --> 00:25:12,780
[sighs] Sergei says tighten 'em?

505
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,949
Yeah. The tighter they are,
the easier they'll snap.

506
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:17,351
Now, bring your hands
down to your knee

507
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:18,886
as you bring your knee up.

508
00:25:18,986 --> 00:25:21,389
You should probably
put the phone down.

509
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:23,324
Okay.

510
00:25:23,424 --> 00:25:26,227
Okay. Yeah.

511
00:25:26,327 --> 00:25:27,661
Ready?

512
00:25:27,762 --> 00:25:30,931
One. Two. Three.

513
00:25:31,032 --> 00:25:31,866
[screams]

514
00:25:31,966 --> 00:25:34,835
[scream echoes]
[growls softly]

515
00:25:36,604 --> 00:25:37,972
[panting] <i>Emily?</i>

516
00:25:38,072 --> 00:25:39,974
Hold on. Hold
on. <i>Are you okay?</i>

517
00:25:40,074 --> 00:25:42,576
<i>I will be, as long
as he didn't hear me.</i>

518
00:25:42,676 --> 00:25:44,445
<i>Did the ties come off?</i>

519
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:45,546
Yep.

520
00:25:45,646 --> 00:25:47,481
Yes! Sergei for the win.

521
00:25:47,581 --> 00:25:49,283
<i>Hey, but are-are you okay?</i>

522
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:51,318
Uh, it cut me up, but there are

523
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:52,996
no major blood vessels
here, so we're good.

524
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,655
<i>Oh, no. You sure it's okay?</i>

525
00:25:54,755 --> 00:25:57,324
Yep. Perks of
being an ER doctor.

526
00:25:58,325 --> 00:25:59,660
Okay.

527
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,495
Okay, let's go.

528
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:02,997
[sighs] Do you see anything else

529
00:26:03,097 --> 00:26:04,932
<i>around here that

Hey. Uh, if you got
lost in the woods

537
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:32,760
on one of your hunting
trips, what would you do?

538
00:26:33,562 --> 00:26:34,895
I wouldn't get lost.

539
00:26:34,995 --> 00:26:36,397
[Sam] <i>Yeah, but if you did.</i>

540
00:26:36,497 --> 00:26:37,731
Hey, we-we got to go. Come on.

541
00:26:37,832 --> 00:26:39,266
One sec. Uh...

542
00:26:39,366 --> 00:26:40,601
Wouldn't happen.

543
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:43,771
Right, but just...
just humor me, dude.

544
00:26:43,871 --> 00:26:45,439
I guess my best bet would be

545
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,042
to find a stream, river.

546
00:26:48,142 --> 00:26:50,512
Chances are it'll lead
me to civilization,

00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,347

Four sixty-five for a dog?
That's highway robbery.

554
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,971
Someone might've
left their card.

[Emily] <i>What?</i>

561
00:27:19,006 --> 00:27:21,041
Okay, did you hear
that? About the water?

562
00:27:21,142 --> 00:27:24,345
Yeah, I heard, but, uh, I
left my divining rod at home.

563
00:27:24,445 --> 00:27:26,013
How do we find a stream, Sam?

<i>Hold on.</i> [sighs]

565
00:27:28,082 --> 00:27:30,351
Okay, it says that birds
can lead you to water.

566
00:27:30,451 --> 00:27:32,453
That, uh, "in the
evenings especially,

567
00:27:32,554 --> 00:27:35,055
following the flight path of
birds could lead you to H2O."

568
00:27:35,156 --> 00:27:38,359
Wait. I heard a flock of birds
fly above me a few minutes ago.

569
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:40,394
Okay, great. Uh,
which way did they go?

No sign of him.

00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,728
I think we might be
safe for a little bit.

Um, I'm in Michigan, I-I think.

Uh, Florida.

590
00:28:37,785 --> 00:28:39,521
Oh, man.

591
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:41,455
Florida, beaches.Shit.

592
00:28:41,556 --> 00:28:43,324
Do you live near the ocean?

593
00:28:43,424 --> 00:28:47,461
No, uh, Tallahassee is a
few hours from the ocean.

594
00:28:47,562 --> 00:28:49,029
Used to, though.

595
00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:53,234
Uh, Jacksonville's a couple
minutes from the water.

596
00:28:53,334 --> 00:28:54,703
I loved it.

597
00:28:54,802 --> 00:28:56,504
Why did you move away?

598
00:28:57,505 --> 00:28:59,206
A lot of things.

599
00:29:01,775 --> 00:29:03,010
Yeah.

600
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,679
I can't believe you're a doctor.

601
00:29:04,778 --> 00:29:06,413
You look so young.

602
00:29:06,514 --> 00:29:08,683
Yeah, it's the bane
of my existence, Sam.

603
00:29:08,782 --> 00:29:11,385
Even interns make Doogie
Howser jokes at me.

604
00:29:11,485 --> 00:29:13,187
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

605
00:29:13,287 --> 00:29:15,022
Oh, it's okay. When
I'm 70, I'll look 40,

606
00:29:15,122 --> 00:29:17,057
and no one will
force me to retire.

607
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,329
Can I, um... can I
ask you a question?

608
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:24,666
Sure.

609
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:27,368
What pushed you to be a doctor?

610
00:29:27,468 --> 00:29:31,138
My mom is an ER nurse, and
she worked crazy hours, too.

611
00:29:31,238 --> 00:29:33,007
So when I was little,
I made this vow

612
00:29:33,107 --> 00:29:34,509
that I'd become a doctor

613
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:36,176
<i>so that I could be
in the hospital, too,</i>

614
00:29:36,277 --> 00:29:37,757
<i>and we could spend
more time together.</i>

615
00:29:37,845 --> 00:29:40,147
<i>It didn't exactly turn
out that way, but, uh,</i>

616
00:29:40,247 --> 00:29:42,016
now I just... I want
to work really hard

617
00:29:42,116 --> 00:29:44,385
so that I can give her
an easier life, you know?

618
00:29:44,485 --> 00:29:46,253
That's really nice.

619
00:29:46,353 --> 00:29:49,923
Yeah, uh, but...

620
00:29:50,024 --> 00:29:51,959
you know, she...

621
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:53,794
she hates flying alone, and...

622
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:56,698
<i>and she kept asking me when I'd
be able to take time off work</i>

623
00:29:56,797 --> 00:30:00,267
<i>so that I could go with her
to visit my grandma in Japan.</i>

624
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:04,405
But I never did. I
never did, and, uh...

625
00:30:04,506 --> 00:30:06,426
<i>You know, it's, like, the
only thing that my mom,</i>

626
00:30:06,508 --> 00:30:08,576
<i>like, ever asked of
me ever, and now...</i>

627
00:30:08,677 --> 00:30:10,745
I don't know...

628
00:30:10,844 --> 00:30:12,880
I don't know if I'm gonna, uh...

629
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,549
No. Okay? No.

630
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:16,116
Um, you're...

631
00:30:16,216 --> 00:30:18,352
you're gonna buy tickets
just as soon as you get back.

632
00:30:18,452 --> 00:30:19,688
Yeah.

633
00:30:19,788 --> 00:30:21,388
Yeah, yeah, no, of course.

well, at least it's...

639
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,502
No. Uh-uh.

640
00:30:34,602 --> 00:30:36,012
No, don't try and make
it something it's not.

641
00:30:36,036 --> 00:30:38,640
<i>Okay? It's what was available.</i>

642
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,116
Well, they need
cashiers everywhere.

643
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,643

to Jacksonville,</i>

[toy squeaks] Uh,
yeah, yeah, I just, um,

646
00:30:46,213 --> 00:30:48,115

a few things first.

647
00:30:48,215 --> 00:30:49,818
<i>How long have you worked there?</i>

648
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:51,586
Um, few years.

649
00:30:51,686 --> 00:30:54,254
I, uh... I moved
back to help my mom.

650
00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:55,923
And then she had
some health issues.

651
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:57,659
Oh, I'm sorry.

652
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,393
Well, how's she doing now?

653
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:03,598
She's not. She...

654
00:31:03,698 --> 00:31:05,966
She passed, so...

655
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:08,570
Oh, I'm so sorry, Sam.

656
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,505
But hey, you know,
that-that is admirable

657
00:31:10,605 --> 00:31:12,873
that you stopped your
life to help her. I mean,

658
00:31:12,973 --> 00:31:14,341

00:31:16,644 --> 00:31:18,312
Yeah.

663
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:24,084

down. [machine grinding]

[footsteps continue]

1056
00:46:24,485 --> 00:46:27,454
You know, in the wild,

1057
00:46:27,555 --> 00:46:30,257
there are these,
uh, pack hunters.

1058
00:46:30,357 --> 00:46:33,927
Animals that rely
on others to live.

1059
00:46:34,028 --> 00:46:36,330
But, you see, I have
always seen myself...

1060
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:38,332
Shut up!

1061
00:46:38,432 --> 00:46:40,535
Shut the fuck up!

1062
00:46:40,635 --> 00:46:42,870
I am so sick of your blah,

1063
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:44,281
blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah!

1064
00:46:44,305 --> 00:46:46,874
No one wants to hear
you talk, Charlie.

1065
00:46:46,974 --> 00:46:48,475
I mean, you think of yourself as

1066
00:46:48,576 --> 00:46:50,277
this modern-day alpha
male philosopher?

1067
00:46:50,377 --> 00:46:52,379
Well, you're just a spoiled,

1068
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:56,483
rich trust-fund kid that
parrots back bad TED Talks.

1069
00:46:56,584 --> 00:46:58,886
Yeah! They're bad!

1070
00:47:01,556 --> 00:47:02,923
I called 911.

1071
00:47:03,023 --> 00:47:04,559
They have your name.

1072
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:06,060
They're tracking my location,

1073
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,362
and they're on
their way right now.

1074
00:47:11,098 --> 00:47:13,300
What, are you still gonna
go through with this?

1075
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,302
You're gonna get
caught, Charlie.

1076
00:47:15,402 --> 00:47:17,171
Sure.

1077
00:47:17,271 --> 00:47:19,708
But there's a difference
between getting caught

1078
00:47:19,808 --> 00:47:21,909
and being convicted.

1079
00:47:24,878 --> 00:47:27,915
You don't get to do this to me

1080
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:29,651
and get away with it.

1081
00:47:29,751 --> 00:47:31,586

[tense music plays]

1083
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:43,931
Now, what do you have
to say for yourself?

1084
00:47:44,031 --> 00:47:45,567
I don't care, Charlie.

1085
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:46,900
I don't care.

1086
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,069
Kill me if you want, but you,

1087
00:47:49,169 --> 00:47:51,872
you do not get to murder
me and play the victim.

1088
00:47:52,674 --> 00:47:53,708
I am the victim.

1089
00:47:53,808 --> 00:47:55,510
Are you kidding me?

1090
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:57,111
No, the victim of
your abandonment.

1091
00:47:57,211 --> 00:47:58,212
Neglect. My...

1092
00:47:58,312 --> 00:47:59,814
After I gave you everything.

1093
00:47:59,913 --> 00:48:01,281
The romantic surprises,

1094
00:48:01,382 --> 00:48:03,718
the trips, the
emotional support.

1095
00:48:03,818 --> 00:48:06,487
Are you forgetting the jealousy?

1096
00:48:06,588 --> 00:48:08,989
Are you forgetting the stalking?

1097
00:48:09,089 --> 00:48:11,158
The holes in my
wall? The bruises?

1098
00:48:11,258 --> 00:48:13,093
Well, you pushed me there.

1099
00:48:13,193 --> 00:48:14,529
Look, how am I supposed to feel

1100
00:48:14,629 --> 00:48:16,397
when you would rather
spend 100-hour weeks

1101
00:48:16,497 --> 00:48:19,233
with disgusting sick
people than with me?

1102
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:21,836
But you're so addicted
to the validation

1103
00:48:21,935 --> 00:48:24,104
that you get at
work... I am not.

1104
00:48:25,472 --> 00:48:27,742
What you will never
understand, Charlie,

1105
00:48:27,842 --> 00:48:29,611
is that some people do things

1106
00:48:29,711 --> 00:48:32,279
for other things
besides validation.

1107
00:48:32,379 --> 00:48:34,516
I work my fucking ass
off so that my mom

1108
00:48:34,616 --> 00:48:36,016
can have a better
life. Your mom?

1109
00:48:36,116 --> 00:48:38,018
It's not for your mom!

1110
00:48:38,118 --> 00:48:40,954
God, how many times did I
see you ignore her calls?

1111
00:48:41,054 --> 00:48:42,824
You see, the truth is, Em...

1112
00:48:42,956 --> 00:48:44,559
Do not call me that.

1113
00:48:46,126 --> 00:48:49,196
You've convinced yourself
that you work so much

1114
00:48:49,296 --> 00:48:51,331
to be a good daughter,

1115
00:48:51,432 --> 00:48:54,736
but it actually makes you
a fucking horrible one.

1116
00:48:54,836 --> 00:48:56,336
A horrible daughter

1117
00:48:56,437 --> 00:49:00,941
and a completely
neglectful partner to me.

1118
00:49:03,711 --> 00:49:07,281
[sniffles] This is
what you do, Charlie.

1119
00:49:07,381 --> 00:49:10,250
You find what hurts in people,

1120
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:12,186
and then... and then...

1121
00:49:12,286 --> 00:49:14,455
and then you use
it like a weapon.

1122
00:49:15,657 --> 00:49:17,424
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

1123
00:49:17,525 --> 00:49:18,425

Stop.

1128
00:49:33,775 --> 00:49:35,008
No! Stop!

Fuck!

1132

Hey, fuck. I want my fucking
phone back, you bitch.

1133
00:49:59,032 --> 00:50:01,836
For the last time,
it's an emergency.

1134
00:50:01,936 --> 00:50:03,303
Whose fucking emergency is it?

1135
00:50:03,403 --> 00:50:04,772
It's not my emergency.

1136
00:50:04,873 --> 00:50:07,074
My emergency is that you
took my fucking phone!

1137
00:50:07,174 --> 00:50:09,577
I'm not afraid of you.

1138
00:50:10,812 --> 00:50:12,680
All right.

1139
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,683
You want a fucking war?

1140
00:50:15,783 --> 00:50:17,417
You got one.

1141
00:50:19,353 --> 00:50:21,589

fucking praying.

Okay.

Fuck. I thought it
was in this one.

me? Shit. Shit.

1158
00:51:34,227 --> 00:51:36,196
Got a little surprise
for you. Okay.

1159
00:51:36,898 --> 00:51:38,900
Don't shoot, okay?

1160
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I can't afford to get shot.
I don't have insurance.

1161
00:51:41,069 --> 00:51:44,204
You deserve a bullet for putting
your filthy hands on my phone.

1162
00:51:44,304 --> 00:51:46,841
That case costs more
than you make in a year.

1163
00:51:46,941 --> 00:51:48,876
It's 24-karat gold.
Now, hand it over.

Okay. Now!

I can still spot his
flashlight, though, right?

1215
00:55:04,105 --> 00:55:06,741
I'm just gonna lay
here until he finds me.

1216
00:55:06,841 --> 00:55:08,509
No, your phone, it
has a flashlight.

1217

I can walk you through,
uh, turning it on, okay?

You're just gonna...

1219
00:55:12,713 --> 00:55:15,817

are we gonna do?

Sam? Yeah?

1224

None of this is
your fault, okay?

1225
00:55:27,128 --> 00:55:29,730
I asked you to do a
pretty impossible thing.

1226

And I'm sorry.

No, Emily. No, no, no,
no, you can't, okay?

I need you to call
someone for me.

00:55:35,903 --> 00:55:38,706
Can you do that, Sam?
No. No, let's just...

1230
00:55:38,806 --> 00:55:40,842
Let's keep going,
right? Let's keep going.

1231
00:55:40,942 --> 00:55:44,045
Call the landline and
put it on speaker.

1232
00:55:44,145 --> 00:55:46,814
No, let's just go.
Okay? Let's just go.

1233
00:55:46,914 --> 00:55:49,584
The number is...

1234
00:55:49,684 --> 00:55:53,087
eight, one, zero, one, two, six,

1235
00:55:53,187 --> 00:55:56,356
zero, one, nine, seven.

1236
00:55:59,994 --> 00:56:03,231
Hey. I thought you hadn't
memorized any numbers

1237
00:56:03,331 --> 00:56:04,899
since middle school.

1238
00:56:04,999 --> 00:56:07,034
<i>Yeah, well,
sometimes it's easier</i>

1239
00:56:07,134 --> 00:56:10,104
<i>to show a stranger how
much you fucked up.</i>

1240
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,342
Please...

1241
00:56:14,441 --> 00:56:16,844
don't make me ask you again.

1242
00:56:21,249 --> 00:56:23,483
[line ringing]

1243
00:56:31,592 --> 00:56:33,160
[woman on phone] <i>Hello?</i>

1244
00:56:34,161 --> 00:56:35,462
[Emily sighs]

1245
00:56:35,563 --> 00:56:37,098
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

1246
00:56:37,198 --> 00:56:39,567
[mom] <i>Em, what's this
number you're calling from?</i>

1247
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:43,137
My friend's phone.
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

1248
00:56:43,237 --> 00:56:44,639
[voice breaking] I'm sorry.

1249
00:56:44,739 --> 00:56:47,074
<i>For what?</i> I...

1250
00:56:47,174 --> 00:56:50,077
You were right, and I
should've listened to you,

1251
00:56:50,177 --> 00:56:53,814
and I'm... I'm sorry
that I got mad at you.

1252
00:56:53,915 --> 00:56:55,482
<i>What has he done to you?</i>

1253
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:57,952
[Emily] <i>Deep down,
I think that I knew</i>

1254
00:56:58,052 --> 00:57:01,889
that you were right,
but I indulged anyway.

1255
00:57:01,989 --> 00:57:03,758
[mom] <i>Em, where are you?</i>

1256
00:57:03,858 --> 00:57:06,661
[Emily] <i>I'm sorry that I
didn't come see you more.</i>

1257
00:57:06,761 --> 00:57:08,362
<i>That I didn't take off work.</i>

1258
00:57:08,461 --> 00:57:10,064
[Emily sobbing]

1259
00:57:10,164 --> 00:57:11,565
<i>I always made excuses.</i>

1260
00:57:11,666 --> 00:57:13,234
[mom] <i>I'm going to come get you.</i>

1261
00:57:13,334 --> 00:57:14,769
<i>Just tell me where you are.</i>

1262
00:57:14,869 --> 00:57:16,837
[crying] I love
you so much, Mom.

1263
00:57:16,938 --> 00:57:19,073
<i>Tell me where you are, Em.</i>

1264
00:57:19,173 --> 00:57:21,242
[Emily] <i>I'm sorry.</i>

1265
00:57:21,342 --> 00:57:24,045
<i>Thank you for everything.
Thank you for...</i>

1266
00:57:24,145 --> 00:57:27,348
<i>for making me strong,
and I'm sorry.</i>

1267
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:30,017
[mom] <i>Emily, tell
me what's going on.</i>

1268
00:57:30,117 --> 00:57:33,888
<i>This is probably the last
time that we're gonna...</i>

1269
00:57:34,889 --> 00:57:35,889
A light.

1270
00:57:35,923 --> 00:57:37,525
Emily.

1271
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:40,661
<i>Emily, there's a light.</i>

1272
00:57:40,761 --> 00:57:42,330
<i>A light went on
behind you, okay?</i>

1273
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:43,631
<i>It could be a house.</i>

1274
00:57:43,731 --> 00:57:45,299
[mom] <i>Em, what's happening?</i>

1275
00:57:45,399 --> 00:57:47,068
[Sam] <i>We can get to
it. It's not far.</i>

1276
00:57:47,168 --> 00:57:49,103
[groans] I don't know.

1277
00:57:49,203 --> 00:57:51,105
Just get up, okay?

1278
00:57:51,205 --> 00:57:52,506
Just get up.

1279
00:57:52,606 --> 00:57:55,209
<i>I can barely stand now, Sam.</i>

1280
00:57:58,379 --> 00:58:00,147
Emily.

1281
00:58:01,615 --> 00:58:03,684
You know how... [sighs]

1282
00:58:03,784 --> 00:58:06,854
You know how you said
that you're sure...

1283
00:58:06,954 --> 00:58:09,023
you're so sure that
my mom was happy

1284
00:58:09,123 --> 00:58:11,292
I was there with
her when she passed?

1285
00:58:11,392 --> 00:58:13,594
Yeah.

1286
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:18,532
I wasn't there.

1287
00:58:18,632 --> 00:58:20,601
Okay, I needed...
I needed a break.

1288
00:58:20,701 --> 00:58:22,603
I needed a break from her
and from her sickness,

1289
00:58:22,703 --> 00:58:24,472
and so I went out
and I got drunk,

1290
00:58:24,572 --> 00:58:27,408
and I left and...

1291
00:58:27,508 --> 00:58:29,744
By the time I got
back home, I...

1292
00:58:30,644 --> 00:58:32,713
Shit.

1293
00:58:34,615 --> 00:58:38,019
I left her, and she...

1294
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:40,154
<i>died, okay?</i>

1295
00:58:40,254 --> 00:58:43,257
<i>And I wanted to leave
you tonight, too,</i>

1296
00:58:43,357 --> 00:58:45,393
<i>so bad, okay?</i>

1297
00:58:45,493 --> 00:58:47,661
<i>I was... scared.</i>

1298
00:58:47,762 --> 00:58:52,133
But you, you asked me to stay.

1299
00:58:52,233 --> 00:58:55,102
Okay? So I stayed, right?

1300
00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:56,771
And now what? What?

1301
00:58:56,871 --> 00:59:00,574
You're just gonna...
you're gonna give up?

1302
00:59:00,674 --> 00:59:03,344
No, no. No, you are
not allowed, okay?

1303
00:59:03,444 --> 00:59:07,081
<i>You, you are not
allowed to give up.</i>

1304
00:59:07,181 --> 00:59:08,849
[mom] <i>Em, who is that?</i>

1305
00:59:08,949 --> 00:59:10,519
[sniffles, chuckles]

1306
00:59:10,618 --> 00:59:11,852
It's Sam, Mom.

1307
00:59:11,952 --> 00:59:14,321
<i>Who's Sam?</i> She's my friend.

1308
00:59:14,422 --> 00:59:18,325
<i>Oh. Then listen to Sam.</i>

1309
00:59:18,426 --> 00:59:19,994
<i>Goddamn it, get up. Em, get up!</i>

1310
00:59:20,094 --> 00:59:21,095
Just get up.

1311
00:59:21,195 --> 00:59:22,229
[crying] I can't.

1312
00:59:22,329 --> 00:59:23,664
Get up.

1313
00:59:23,764 --> 00:59:25,242
[mom] <i>Get up.</i> [Sam]
<i>Emily, you can do it.</i>

1314
00:59:25,266 --> 00:59:26,834
He's gonna find me
no matter what I do.

1315
00:59:26,934 --> 00:59:28,302
He's gonna... he's
gonna find me.

1316
00:59:28,402 --> 00:59:30,171
[Sam] <i>No, no. Emily,
I'm not gonna leave you.</i>

1317
00:59:30,271 --> 00:59:31,882
<i>Just get up.</i> [mom]
<i>Come on, honey. Get up.</i>

1318
00:59:31,906 --> 00:59:35,009
Okay, you just... you
just have to get up.

1319
00:59:35,109 --> 00:59:38,212
<i>Okay? I am right
here. I didn't leave.</i>

1320
00:59:38,312 --> 00:59:39,480
I'm right here.

1321
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,348
Okay? Go. Just get up.

1322
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:43,751
<i>Just get up, please.</i>

1323
00:59:43,851 --> 00:59:46,153
Is there really
a light? [crying]

1324
00:59:46,253 --> 00:59:48,889
Yes, yes, yes. [mom]
<i>You can do this, okay?</i>

1325
00:59:48,989 --> 00:59:50,758
<i>Listen to your friend.
She's gonna help you.</i>

1326
00:59:50,858 --> 00:59:52,726
<i>Just come home.</i>

1327
00:59:52,827 --> 00:59:54,061
I think maybe I see it.

1328
00:59:54,161 --> 00:59:56,430
[Sam] <i>It's there.
Okay, trust me.</i>

1329
00:59:56,531 --> 00:59:58,466
Okay.

1330
00:59:58,567 --> 01:00:00,634
Okay, Sam.

1331
01:00:00,734 --> 01:00:02,537
Lead me to the light.

1332

1333
01:00:04,573 --> 01:00:06,207

[Sam] <i>Yeah, we're almost
there. Just keep going.</i>

1339
01:00:26,127 --> 01:00:27,962
<i>I see it. Right up ahead.</i>

1340
01:00:28,062 --> 01:00:30,397
What is it? <i>It's a barn.</i>

1341
01:00:30,498 --> 01:00:33,367
<i>Okay, let's see if there's
a house nearby. Scan.</i>

1342

Okay.

01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:36,804
Shit.

1344
01:00:36,904 --> 01:00:38,439
I see his flashlight.
Turn around.

1345
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:40,141
Get in the barn.

1346
01:00:41,142 --> 01:00:43,512
<i>Straight. It's in front of you.</i>

[panicked gasping]

1348
01:00:48,482 --> 01:00:50,351
All right, what do you see?

1349
01:00:50,451 --> 01:00:51,685
I need a weapon.

1350
01:00:51,785 --> 01:00:54,755

um, uh, uh, stairs going up.

1353
01:01:00,562 --> 01:01:02,796
What, no pitchfork? Axe? Gun?

1354
01:01:02,897 --> 01:01:04,765
No. No, not yet.

1355
01:01:04,865 --> 01:01:06,934

Sam.

Anything look good?

Sam, what is
happening over there?

1384

Open this fucking door!

There-there is a couple here,

and, well, they...
they have guns.

01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:05,486
What do you... what do
you mean, they have guns?

1388
01:03:05,587 --> 01:03:06,820
I took this woman's phone

1389
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,789
to call you, and... Let us in!

1390
01:03:08,889 --> 01:03:10,659

1392
01:03:12,426 --> 01:03:15,129
You ruined my <i>fête de yacht!</i>

You will pay for that!

you have to call the police.</i>

No, no, no, no. I really...
I really did steal the phone,

1396
01:03:24,338 --> 01:03:26,775
so, um, you know, if,
uh... if I call the police,

1397
01:03:26,874 --> 01:03:28,351
they're gonna come
and they're gonna...
