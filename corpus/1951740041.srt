Subtiltes by Rajanee

2
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,520 
(Cries out)

3
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,800 
So where are you?

4
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,880 
You're in some motel room.

5
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000 
You just wake up and you're in...

6
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,320 
..in a motel room. There's the key.

7
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,880 
It feels like maybe it's the first time
you've been here but...

8
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,520 
..perhaps you've been there for a week,...

9
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,000 
..three months, it's...

10
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,200 
It's kind of hard to say, I... I don't know.

11
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,320 
It's just an anonymous room.

12
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000 
This guy. He's here already.

13
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,880 
Lenny!

14
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,320 
It's Leonard.

15
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,880 
- Like I told you before.
- Did you? I must have forgot.

16
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600 
I guess I've already told you
about my condition.

17
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,320 
Oh, well, only every time I see you.

18
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,400 
- My car.
- This is your car.

19
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,880 
Oh, you're in a playful mood.

20
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,120 
- It's not good to make fun of a handicap.
- Just trying to have a little fun.

21
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,120 
(starts engine)

22
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,800 
- Roll up your window.
- Hmm?

23
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,680 
- It's broken.
- I can get that fixed for you.

24
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,880 
- So, where to, Sherlock?
- I got a lead on a place.

25
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,120 
- What the hell you wanna go there for?
- You know it?

26
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,800 
Yeah, it's just this fucked up building.
Why do you wanna go there?

27
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,120 
Don't remember.

28
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000 
- Looks like somebody's home.
- Ah, that thing's been here for years.

29
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,400 
What are you talking about?
These tracks are only a few days old.

30
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,120 
Tracks? What are you, Pocahontas?

31
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,600 
Come on.

32
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,200 
Let's take a look inside.

33
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,120 
Teddy.

34
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,200 
Don't believe his lies.
He is the one. Kill him.

35
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,200 
I've finally found him.

36
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,400 
How long have I been looking?

37
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,480 
Find anything?

38
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,880 
Didn't think so.

39
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,200 
Let's go, huh?

40
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,480 
Oh, fuck this.

41
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,200 
You're gonna pay for what you did.

42
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,880 
Beg forgiveness and then you pay.

43
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,320 
You don't have a clue, you freak!

44
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,000 
Beg my wife's forgiveness
before I blow your brains out.

45
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,880 
Leonard, you don't know what's going on.

46
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,320 
- You don't even know my name.
- Teddy.

47
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,480 
Cuz you read it off a fucking picture.

48
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,680 
(breathless) You don't know who you are.

49
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,200 
- I'm Leonard Shelby from San Francisco.
- That's who you were. That's not...

50
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,120 
..what you've become.

51
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,320 
- Shut your mouth.
- You want to know, Lenny? Come on.

52
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,680 
Come on, let's go down to the basement.

53
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,600 
Let's go down, you and me together.

54
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,680 
Then you'll know who you really are.

55
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800 
- (Teddy) No!
- (gunshot)

56
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,320 
It's just an anonymous room.

57
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,800 
There's nothing in the drawers.
But you look anyway.

58
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,200 
Nothing except the Gideon Bible,...

59
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,000 
..which I, of course, read religiously.
(laughs) Hmm.

60
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,880 
You know who you are
and you know kind of all about yourself.

61
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,680 
But just for day-to-day stuff,
notes are really useful.

62
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,520 
Sammy Jankis had the same problem
but he really had no system.

63
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,800 
He wrote himself a ridiculous amount
of notes but he'd get them all mixed up.

64
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,880 
You really do need a system if...

65
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,880 
..if you're gonna make it work.

66
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880 
(presses bell)

67
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,400 
- Hi.
- Hi.

68
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,600 
- I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
- What can I do for you, Leonard?

69
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,520 
- Um...
- Burt.

70
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,800 
Burt. I'm not sure, I think
I may have asked you to hold my calls.

71
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,600 
- You don't know?
- I'm not too good on the phone.

72
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,320 
You said you like to look people in the eye
when you talk to them.

73
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,680 
Yeah, yeah.

74
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,400 
- You don't remember saying that.
- I have this condition.

75
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,800 
- A condition?
- It's my memory.

76
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,400 
- Amnesia?
- No, no, it's different from that.

77
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,480 
I have no short-term memory.
I know all about myself, I just...

78
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,320 
Since my injury I can't make
new memories. Everything fades.

79
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,680 
If we talk for too long
I'll forget how we started...

80
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,400 
..and next time I see you
I won't remember this conversation.

81
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,880 
I don't even know if I've met you before.

82
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,880 
So if I seem a little strange
or rude, or something, uh...

83
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,200 
I've told you this before, haven't I?

84
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,200 
I don't mean to mess with you
but it's so weird.

85
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,400 
- You don't remember me at all?
- No.

86
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,200 
- We've talked a bunch of times.
- I'm sure we have.

87
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,200 
What's the last thing you remember?

88
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400 
My wife.

89
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,680 
What's it like?

90
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,480 
It's like waking.

91
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,880 
It's like you just woke up.

92
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,520 
That must suck.

93
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,120 
It's all backwards.

94
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,000 
Like, maybe you got an idea
about what you want to do next...

95
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,200 
..but you don't remember
what you just did.

96
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,800 
I mean, I'm exactly the opposite...

97
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,800 
- How long have I been staying here?
- Couple of days.

98
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,320 
- And you're holding my calls?
- Like you said.

99
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,680 
OK, but this guy's an exception.

100
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,120 
You know this guy?

101
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,120 
- Yeah, it's your friend, right?
- What makes you think that?

102
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,520 
- I saw you together, that's all.
- He's not my friend.

103
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,880 
OK.

104
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,480 
If he calls or shows up here,
give me a call in my room, OK?

105
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600 
- What, his name's Teddy?
- Teddy, yeah.

106
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,400 
All right.

107
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,600 
Look, I hope my condition's
not gonna be a problem for you.

108
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,880 
Not as long as you remember
to pay the bill.

109
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,480 
Yeah. OK.

110
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,880 
Forty.

111
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,000 
This guy.

112
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,880 
He's here already.

113
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,600 
Lenny!

114
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,680 
You really need a system
if you're gonna make it work.

115
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,120 
You kinda learn to trust your handwriting.
It becomes an important part of your life.

116
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,000 
You write yourself notes.
Where you put them is really important.

117
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,680 
You need a jacket that's got,
like, six pockets,...

118
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,680 
..particular pockets
for particular things.

119
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,000 
You just kinda learn to know where
things go and how the system works.

120
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,400 
You have to be wary of other people
writing stuff for you...

121
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,400 
..that is not going to make sense
or is gonna lead you astray.

122
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,600 
I don't know what makes people
take advantage...

123
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,680 
..of somebody with this condition.

124
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,520 
If you have a piece of information
which... is...

125
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,000 
..vital, writing on your body instead of
on a piece of paper can be the answer.

126
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,120 
It's a permanent way of keeping a note.

127
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,120 
(phone rings)

128
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,680 
Who is this?

129
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,680 
Remember Sammy Jankis.

130
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,120 
(door opens)

131
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,200 
- Sir, you left these at your table.
- Thanks.

132
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200 
Ah, Lincoln Street?

133
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,120 
Just go straight out on Sixth Street,...

134
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200 
- ..go east through town...
- I'm gonna write this down.

135
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,520 
- Oh, it's easy. Go straight out...
- Trust me, I need to write this down.

136
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,120 
The Discount Inn.

137
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,800 
Discount Inn.

138
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,520 
Natalie.

139
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,800 
My car.

140
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400 
Teddy.

141
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,680 
John Edward Gammell.

142
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,200 
This guy told me his name was Teddy.

143
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,800 
Don't believe his lies.

144
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,120 
(dials)

145
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800 
(ringing tone)

146
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,400 
- Yeah?
- Mr. Gammell?

147
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,520 
- Lenny, is that you?
- John Gammell?

148
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,880 
Lenny, it's Teddy.
Stay there. I'll be right over.

149
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,880 
- OK. I'll be waiting.
- (line goes dead)

150
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,880 
White male.

151
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000 
First name, John.

152
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,800 
Last name G for Gammell.

153
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,520 
Drugs.

154
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,200 
License plate.

155
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,600 
SG1 3...

156
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,320 
..7IU.

157
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,800 
It's him.

158
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,600 
I've found you, you fuck.

159
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,800 
You said we talked before.
I don't remember that.

160
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,800 
Yeah, but it's not amnesia.

161
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,200 
I remember up until my injury,
I just can't make new memories.

162
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,480 
So I can't remember talking to you.
What did we talk about?

163
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,480 
Oh, Sammy Jankis.

164
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,200 
I guess I tell people about Sammy
to help them understand.

165
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,320 
Sammy's story helps me understand
my own situation.

166
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,000 
Sammy wrote himself
endless amounts of notes.

167
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,880 
But he got mixed up.

168
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,200 
I have a more graceful solution
to the memory problem.

169
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,680 
I'm disciplined and organized.

170
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,520 
I use habit and routine
to make my life possible.

171
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,800 
Sammy had no drive,...

172
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,880 
..no reason to make it work.

173
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,320 
Me?

174
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,680 
Yeah,...

175
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,800 
..I got a reason.

176
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000 
(activates alarm)

177
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,320 
Today, 1pm, meet Natalie for info.

178
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,480 
She has also lost someone.
She will help you out of pity.

179
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,200 
- Natalie.
- You don't remember me.

180
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,880 
- I should've explained. I have this cond...
- You did explain, Lenny.

181
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,520 
Please call me Leonard.
My wife called me Lenny.

182
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,000 
- I know, you told me.
- Then I probably told you I hated it.

183
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,880 
Yeah.

184
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,800 
Do you mind taking your glasses off?
It's hard for me to...

185
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,120 
Thanks.

186
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,600 
So, you have information for me?

187
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,320 
- Is that what your little note says?
- Yeah.

188
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,680 
Must be tough living your life
according to a couple of scraps of paper.

189
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,120 
Mix your laundry list with your grocery list
and you'll end up eating your underwear.

190
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,800 
I guess that's why you have
those freaky tattoos.

191
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,400 
Yeah, it's tough. It's almost impossible.

192
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,800 
Look, I'm sorry I don't remember you.
It's nothing personal.

193
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,320 
I do have information for you.

194
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,800 
You gave me a license-plate number.

195
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,200 
Had my friend at DMV trace it.

196
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,000 
Guess what name came up?

197
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,400 
John Edward Gammell. John G.

198
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,680 
Do you know him?

199
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,400 
No. But his face on his driver's license
looked really familiar.

200
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,120 
I think he's been in the bar, maybe.

201
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,520 
Here's a copy of his license,
his registration, photo and all.

202
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,520 
Are you sure you want this?

203
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,200 
- Have I told you what this man did?
- Yeah.

204
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,480 
Well, then you shouldn't have to ask.

205
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,680 
Even if you get revenge,
you're not gonna remember it.

206
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,800 
You're not even gonna know it happened.

207
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,120 
My wife deserves vengeance. It doesn't
make any difference if I know about it.

208
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,400 
Just because
there are things I don't remember...

209
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,680 
..doesn't make my actions meaningless.

210
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,120 
The world doesn't just disappear
when you close your eyes.

211
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,800 
Anyway, maybe I'll take a photograph
to remind myself.

212
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,800 
Get another freaky tattoo.

213
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,120 
Tell me about her again.

214
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,400 
Why?

215
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,120 
Because you like to remember her.

216
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,880 
She was beautiful.

217
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,480 
- To me she was perfect.
- No.

218
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,400 
Don't just recite the words.

219
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,680 
Close your eyes and remember her.

220
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,880 
You can just feel the details.

221
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,680 
The bits and pieces
you never bothered to put into words.

222
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000 
And you can feel these extreme moments.

223
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,800 
Even if you don't want to.

224
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,200 
You put these together
and you get the feel of a person.

225
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,480 
Enough to know
how much you miss them.

226
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,400 
And how much you hate the person
who took them away.

227
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,120 
I, um, I added an address in here.

228
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,520 
It might be useful.
It's an abandoned place outside of town.

229
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,400 
Um, I guy I knew
used to do bigger deals there.

230
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,400 
It's isolated.

231
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,400 
Sounds perfect.

232
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000 
- Do I owe you any...
- I wasn't helping you for money.

233
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,200 
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

234
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320 
See, you have this condition.

235
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,120 
You still staying at the Discount Inn?
Room 304? Left it at my place.

236
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,800 
Yeah.

237
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,320 
- They treating you OK?
- I don't remember.

238
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000 
You know what we have in common?

239
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,200 
We are both survivors.

240
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,400 
You take care, Leonard.

241
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,120 
Remember Sammy Jankis.

242
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,000 
I met Sammy through work. Insurance.
I was an investigator.

243
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,520 
I'd investigate the claims
to see which ones were phony.

244
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,520 
I had to see through people's bullshit.

245
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,200 
It was useful experience
cuz now it's my life.

246
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,520 
When I meet someone,
I don't know if I've met them before.

247
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,880 
I have to look in their eyes
and try and figure them out.

248
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,120 
My job taught me the best way to find out
what someone knew was let them talk.

249
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,000 
Watch the eyes and the body language.

250
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,000 
If someone scratches their nose,
experts tell you it means they're lying.

251
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,480 
It really means they're nervous. People
get nervous for all sorts of reasons.

252
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,680 
It's all about context.

253
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,680 
Yeah, I was good.

254
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,680 
Sammy was my first real challenge.

255
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,880 
(engine starts)

256
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,120 
Yo, Lenny! I thought you'd split for good.

257
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,480 
- Well, things change.
- So I see.

258
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,520 
- My name's Teddy.
- I guess I've told you about my condition.

259
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,400 
Only every time I see ya.
Come on, I'll buy you lunch.

260
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,000 
- Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
- Mmm. Yeah.

261
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,000 
I'm sick of hearing about the guy.

262
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,200 
What about John G?
You think he's still here?

263
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,800 
- Who?
- Johnny G, the guy you're looking for.

264
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,200 
- That's why you haven't left town, right?
- Maybe.

265
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,520 
- Leonard, you have to be very careful.
- Why?

266
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,480 
You mentioned that maybe somebody
was trying to set you up.

267
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,120 
Get you to kill the wrong guy.

268
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,600 
I go on facts, not recommendations,
but thank you.

269
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,600 
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life
to your little notes and pictures.

270
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,400 
- Why not?
- Because your notes could be unreliable.

271
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,120 
- Memory's unreliable.
- Oh, please.

272
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,680 
No, really. Memory's not perfect,
it's not even that good. Ask the police.

273
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,120 
Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.

274
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,600 
The cops don't catch a killer
by sitting around remembering stuff.

275
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,480 
- They collect facts and draw conclusions.
- That's not what I'm saying.

276
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,680 
Facts, not memories.

277
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,000 
That's how you investigate.
I know, it's what I used to do.

278
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,880 
Memory can change the shape of a room,
it can change the color of a car.

279
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,320 
And memories can be distorted.

280
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,320 
They're an interpretation, not a record.

281
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,400 
They're irrelevant if you have the facts.

282
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,400 
You really want to get this guy, don't you?

283
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,880 
He killed my wife.
He took away my fucking memory.

284
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,200 
He destroyed my ability to live.

285
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,320 
You're living.

286
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,000 
Only for revenge.

287
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,320 
Well, then we'll get the bastard.

288
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,520 
Where are you staying?

289
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,200 
The Discount Inn. I don't know what room.
I haven't got my key.

290
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,400 
Probably left it in your room.

291
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,480 
(rings bell)

292
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,000 
Hi.

293
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,200 
I'm checked in here
but I think I've misplaced my key.

294
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,400 
How you doing, Leonard?
Probably in the room, right?

295
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,680 
- I don't see my key anywhere.
- Oh, shit. This is the wrong room.

296
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,600 
You're in 304. I'm sorry. I fucked up.

297
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,400 
- This is not my room?
- No. Come on, let's go.

298
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,320 
Then why is this my handwriting?

299
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,120 
Well,... this was your room
but now you're in 304.

300
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,320 
- When was I in here?
- Last week.

301
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,680 
- Then I rented you another room on top.
- Why?

302
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,200 
Business is slow, I mean, I told my boss
about your condition and stuff,...

303
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,880 
..he said rent him another room.

304
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,120 
So how many rooms am I checked into
in this shit hole?

305
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,600 
Just two. So far.

306
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,400 
Well,...

307
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,000 
..at least you're being honest
about ripping me off.

308
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,480 
- You're not going to remember anyway.
- You don't have to be that honest, Burt.

309
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,200 
Leonard. Always get a receipt.

310
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,200 
Oh, yeah. I'll write that down.

311
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,400 
- Hey, what time is it?
- Quarter to one.

312
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,520 
Excuse me.

313
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,120 
Your room's...

314
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,320 
- Natalie.
- You don't remember me.

315
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,480 
I'd just become an investigator
when I came across Sammy.

316
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,120 
Mr. Samuel R Jankis, strangest case ever.

317
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,200 
The guy's a 58-year-old,
semi-retired accountant.

318
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,520 
He and his wife were in this car accident,
nothing serious.

319
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,600 
But he's acting funny,
he can't get a handle on what's going on.

320
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,600 
The doctors find some possible damage
to the hippocampus, nothing conclusive.

321
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,200 
Sammy can't remember anything
for more than a couple of minutes.

322
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,600 
Can't work, can't do shit.

323
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,800 
The medical bills pile up, his wife calls
the insurance company and I get sent in.

324
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,880 
This is my first big claims investigation
so I really check into it.

325
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,520 
Sammy can think just fine
but he can't make new memories.

326
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,120 
He can only remember things
for a couple of minutes.

327
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,800 
He'd watch TV but anything longer than
a couple of minutes was too confusing,...

328
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,880 
..he couldn't remember how it began.

329
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,200 
He liked commercials. They were short.

330
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,120 
Sammy. It's time for my shot.

331
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,120 
The crazy part was that this guy,...

332
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,600 
..who couldn't follow
the plot of Green Acres any more,...

333
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,680 
..could do the most complicated things,...

334
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,880 
..as long as he learned them
before the accident...

335
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,520 
..and as long as he kept his mind
on what he was doing.

336
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,200 
The doctors assure me...

337
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,400 
..there's a real condition, anterial-grade
memory loss, or short-term memory loss.

338
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,400 
It's rare but legit.

339
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,400 
But every time I see him,...

340
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,800 
..I catch this look,...

341
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,120 
..this... slight look of recognition.

342
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,880 
But he says he can't remember me at all.

343
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,480 
Sammy, it's OK. I got it.

344
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,120 
- Hi, Mr. Shelby.
- Hi, Mrs. Jankis.

345
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,320 
Now, I can read people
and I'm thinking ''bad actor''.

346
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,000 
So now I'm suspicious
and I order more tests.

347
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,320 
Awake.

348
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,120 
Oh, where am I?

349
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,520 
Somebody's bedroom.

350
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,520 
Oh, it must be her room.

351
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400 
But who is she?

352
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,800 
It's only me.

353
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,880 
- Did you sleep OK?
- Yeah. You?

354
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,320 
Oh, shit. Shit.

355
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,120 
I gotta be someplace.

356
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,200 
It's pretty weird.

357
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,800 
It's useful. You never
write a phone number on your hand?

358
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,000 
I, um, I should be able
to talk to my friend today...

359
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,120 
- ..about the license plate.
- Yeah, the license plate.

360
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,520 
John G's license plate.

361
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,200 
You have it tattooed on your thigh.

362
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,680 
Natalie.

363
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,520 
She has also lost someone.
She will help you out of pity.

364
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,480 
If it's registered in this state,...

365
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,680 
..it should only take a couple seconds
to pull up his license and registration.

366
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,200 
I'll call you as soon as I talk to him.

367
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,120 
Could we arrange a meeting now?
I'm not too good on the phone.

368
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,200 
You know, it's great that you...

369
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,200 
Well, that you're...

370
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,000 
..helping me...

371
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,600 
..like this.

372
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,880 
I'm helping you because you helped me.

373
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,880 
So next time you see me,...

374
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,400 
..will you remember me?

375
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,880 
(softly) I think you will.

376
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,880 
(softly) I'm sorry.

377
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,600 
Lenny, before you go,
could I have my shirt back, please?

378
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,680 
(engine starts)

379
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,120 
Yo, Lenny! I thought you'd split for good.

380
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,120 
Sammy couldn't pick up
any new skills at all.

381
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,480 
But I find something in my research.

382
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,120 
Conditioning.

383
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,000 
Sammy should still be able to learn
through repetition.

384
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,320 
It's how you learn stuff like riding a bike.
You get better through practice.

385
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,480 
It's a different part of the brain
from the short-term memory.

386
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,000 
So I had the doctors
test Sammy's response to conditioning.

387
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,120 
- Pick up any three objects.
- That's a test?

388
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,400 
Where were you guys when I did my CPA?

389
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,880 
Sorry.

390
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,320 
Ta-da!

391
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,120 
- (buzz)
- Ow! What the fuck?

392
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,480 
- It's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack.

393
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,120 
Some of the objects were electrified.
They'd give him a shock.

394
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,120 
They kept repeating the test,
always with the same objects electrified.

395
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,480 
The point was to see if Sammy could
learn to avoid the electrified objects,...

396
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,800 
..not by memory, but by instinct.

397
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,320 
(activates alarm)

398
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,520 
(knocks on door)

399
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,200 
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

400
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,200 
Guess I don't have to worry about him
any more.

401
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,120 
- What the fuck have you got me into?
- Shh. Come inside.

402
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,120 
- Who is he?
- Calm down. OK?

403
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,480 
This is my problem. You offered to help.
It's nothing to do with your investigation.

404
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,120 
How did you get me into this?

405
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,120 
You offered to help me
when you saw what he did to my face.

406
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,600 
- How do I know he did that to your face?
- I came straight to you after he did it.

407
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,880 
I showed you what he did
and I asked you to help me.

408
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,680 
- Oh, and I just take your word?
- Yeah.

409
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,320 
Something doesn't feel right.

410
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,680 
I think someone's fucking with me,
trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.

411
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,000 
- Did you?
- What?

412
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,880 
Kill him?

413
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,320 
- Course not!
- Hey. Sit down, OK? Sit.

414
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,680 
This has nothing to do with you.
You helped me out and I'm grateful.

415
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,120 
You have to burn them.

416
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,320 
Leonard, you decided to help me.
Trust your own judgment.

417
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,680 
You can question everything,
you can never know anything for sure.

418
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,400 
- There are things you know for sure.
- Such as?

419
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,880 
I know what that's gonna sound like
when I knock on it. (knocks)

420
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,200 
I know what that's gonna feel like
when I pick it up. See?

421
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,000 
Certainties. It's the kind of memory
you take for granted.

422
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,320 
You know, I can remember so much.

423
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,320 
The feel of the world...

424
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800 
And her.

425
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,320 
She's gone.

426
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,120 
And the present is trivia
which I scribble down as fucking notes.

427
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,800 
Hey, come on. Try and relax. Come on.

428
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,800 
- It's not easy for me to relax.
- Shh. Shhh.

429
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,200 
Come on, take your jacket off.

430
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,520 
(softly) Here. Come on.

431
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,680 
(softly) Hey.

432
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,880 
Didn't think you were the type.

433
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,880 
It's backwards.

434
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,400 
Come here. Come here.

435
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,120 
What about here?

436
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,880 
Maybe it's... for when I find him.

437
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,000 
I've lost somebody too.

438
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,200 
I'm sorry.

439
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,120 
His name was Jimmy.

440
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,480 
- What happened to him?
- He went to meet somebody.

441
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,400 
He never came back.

442
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,320 
- Who did he go to meet?
- A guy called Teddy.

443
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,120 
What do the police think?

444
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,000 
They don't look too hard
for guys like Jimmy.

445
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,200 
When you find this guy, this...

446
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,400 
..John G, what are you gonna do?

447
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,680 
I'm gonna kill him.

448
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,120 
Maybe I can help you find him.

449
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,600 
I don't even know how long
she's been gone.

450
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,120 
It's like I've woken up in bed
and she's not here...

451
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,800 
..because she's gone to the bathroom
or something.

452
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,320 
But somehow I just...

453
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,120 
I just know
she's never gonna come back to bed.

454
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,880 
If I could just...

455
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,880 
..reach over
and touch her side of the bed,...

456
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,800 
..I would know that it was cold.

457
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,120 
But I can't.

458
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,600 
I know I can't have her back.

459
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,120 
But I don't want to wake up in the morning
thinking she's still here.

460
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,880 
I lie here not knowing
how long I've been alone.

461
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,520 
So how...

462
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,120 
How can I heal?

463
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,520 
How am I supposed to heal if I can't...

464
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,320 
..feel time?

465
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,000 
She has also lost someone.
She will help you out of pity.

466
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,800 
They kept testing Sammy for months.

467
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,680 
Always with the same objects
carrying the electrical charge.

468
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,800 
- (buzz)
- Ow! What the fuck?

469
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,200 
- It's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack!

470
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,320 
Even with total short-term memory loss,...

471
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,600 
..Sammy should have learned instinctively
to stop picking up the wrong objects.

472
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,520 
Other cases responded to conditioning,
Sammy didn't respond at all.

473
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,120 
It suggested that his condition
was psychological not physical.

474
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,520 
We turned down his claim on the grounds
that he wasn't covered for mental illness.

475
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,880 
His wife got stuck with the bills
and I got a big promotion.

476
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,400 
Conditioning didn't work for Sammy,
so he became helpless.

477
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,400 
But it works for me.

478
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,520 
I live the way Sammy couldn't.

479
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,000 
Habit and routine make my life possible.

480
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,680 
Conditioning. Acting on instinct.

481
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,680 
(muffled cries)

482
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,480 
(smash)

483
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,320 
Awake.

484
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,520 
Where am I?

485
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,880 
Motel room.

486
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,320 
Oh.

487
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,600 
Some anonymous motel room.

488
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,320 
Nothing in the drawers.
But I'll take a look anyway.

489
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,400 
Nothing except the Gideon Bi...

490
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,320 
Bible.

491
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,000 
- (knock on door)
- Hey! Open up!

492
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,320 
- (muffled cries)
- Just a minute!

493
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,120 
Open the door!

494
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,600 
- (muffled cries)
- (knocks) Lenny?

495
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,320 
(knocking continues) Open the door!

496
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,320 
Come on!

497
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,320 
- Hi, Teddy.
- Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?

498
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,680 
- Oh!
- (muffled cries)

499
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,880 
(sighs)

500
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,880 
- (muffled cries)
- Oh, I get it.

501
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,120 
- Amorous neighbors.
- What are you doing here?

502
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,680 
(laughs) You called me.
You said you needed my help.

503
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,120 
You know, I've had more
rewarding friendships than this one.

504
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,520 
Although I do get to keep telling
the same jokes.

505
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,200 
What the fuck is that?

506
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,800 
Who the fuck is that?

507
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,880 
- You don't know him?
- No! Should I?

508
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,000 
- Wait a minute. Is that John G?
- I don't think so.

509
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,120 
You don't think so?
You didn't write it down?

510
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,320 
- I might have fallen asleep before I did.
- For Christ sakes!

511
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,320 
Ask him.

512
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,400 
What's your name? Your name?

513
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,680 
- Dodd.
- And who did this to you?

514
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,800 
- What?
- Who did this to you?

515
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,400 
You did.

516
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,120 
- I'm not going to help you kill that guy.
- No, no. Just let me think for a minute.

517
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,320 
(muffled cries)

518
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,480 
OK, Natalie. Who's Natalie? Natalie who?

519
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,680 
- Why?
- Maybe I know her.

520
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,320 
Look, we gotta get him out of here.

521
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,320 
All right, all right, all right.

522
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,200 
He's got to have a car, right?

523
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,400 
We take him to his car, tell him to get the
fuck out of town or we're gonna kill him.

524
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,520 
We can't walk him out of here
tied up and bleeding.

525
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,880 
- How the fuck did you get him up here?
- I don't know!

526
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,320 
- You don't know.
- (muffled banging)

527
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,320 
Yes, I do. This is not my room.
It must be his room. Great. Let's go.

528
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,400 
- No, no, no. We can't just leave him here.
- Why not?

529
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,400 
Because the maid's gonna walk in.
She'll see him, call the cops. He can ID us.

530
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,320 
OK. We untie him, we clean him up...

531
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,400 
..and we march him out of here
with a gun in his back.

532
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,480 
A gun. Why would I have a gun?

533
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,600 
It must be his. I don't think
they'd let someone like me carry a gun.

534
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,680 
Fucking hope not.

535
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,680 
Which one?

536
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,680 
We should probably steal his car.
You know, teach him a lesson.

537
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,600 
- Shut up.
- It's all right for you, you've got the Jag.

538
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,680 
All right, get in.
I'm gonna ride with him, you follow us.

539
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,680 
Give me your keys.

540
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,680 
Take your own car.

541
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,680 
So was he scared?

542
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,600 
I think it was your sinister moustache.

543
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,400 
Fuck you. Should have stolen his car.

544
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,320 
- Why? What's wrong with this one?
- Nothing. You want to trade?

545
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,480 
So what do you do now?

546
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,600 
I'm gonna find out
what the fuck that was all about.

547
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,800 
(knocks)

548
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,480 
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

549
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,880 
Sammy's wife was crippled
by the cost of supporting him.

550
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000 
And fighting the company's decision.

551
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,000 
But it wasn't the money that got to her.

552
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,480 
I never said that Sammy was faking.

553
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,480 
Sammy, I have an idea.

554
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,800 
Just that his problem was mental,
not physical.

555
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,480 
You're gonna have a pen in your pocket.

556
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,320 
She couldn't understand.

557
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,880 
- I did something wrong?
- You did something wrong!

558
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,200 
We're gonna deal with it.
We're gonna try a little harder.

559
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,120 
She looks into his eyes
and sees the same person...

560
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,680 
..and if it's not a physical problem,
he should snap out of it.

561
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,800 
- Ellen called!
- Ellen called.

562
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,680 
Ellen called.
Ellen... Ellen can't come today!

563
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,320 
- Ellen can't come!
- I'm so sorry! I'm sorry!

564
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,600 
- I'm trying! I'm sorry!
- (sobs)

565
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,120 
So, Leonard Shelby from the insurance
company gives her the seed of doubt.

566
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,680 
Just like he gave it to the doctors.

567
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,120 
But I never said that he was faking.

568
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,120 
I never said that.

569
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,320 
Hmm. I don't feel drunk.

570
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,880 
(door closes)

571
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,120 
(toilet flushes)

572
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,600 
- Hello? Housekeeping.
- Oh, shit!

573
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,320 
- Not right now!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

574
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:03,120 
Dodd. Put him onto Teddy
or just get rid of him for Natalie.

575
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,680 
Dodd.

576
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,400 
Get rid of him. Ask Natalie.

577
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,800 
Teddy, Teddy.

578
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,880 
(dialing tone)

579
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,480 
(ringing)

580
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,120 
Yeah, leave your number,
you know what to do.

581
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,120 
- (beep)
- Yeah. This is a message for Teddy.

582
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,320 
I'm at the Mount Crest Inn on Fifth Street,
room six.

583
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,120 
I need you to come over
as soon as you get this. It's important.

584
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,320 
Oh, this is Leonard. Thanks. Bye.

585
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,320 
Phew!

586
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,320 
Fuck!

587
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,400 
Mrs. Jankis didn't understand that you
can't bully someone into remembering.

588
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,400 
The more pressure you're under,
the harder it gets.

589
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,120 
Ah. Well, then, call me back?

590
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,520 
(car alarm, car horn)

591
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,680 
OK. So what am I doing?

592
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,480 
Oh, I'm chasing this guy.

593
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,800 
No. He's chasing me.

594
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,200 
(car alarm, car horn)

595
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,320 
(clicks off alarm)

596
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,680 
(tires squeal)

597
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,320 
Ah! Fuck!

598
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:10,000 
Dodd, white guy,
Mount Crest Inn on Fifth Street.

599
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,120 
I'll get the jump on you, you fucker.

600
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,120 
Oh, fuck!

601
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,200 
Sorry.

602
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,200 
I need a weapon.

603
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,480 
This'll do.

604
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,600 
Hmm. I don't feel drunk.

605
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,400 
(clicks off alarm)

606
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,800 
(car horn)

607
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,200 
(car horn)

608
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,400 
Do I know this guy?

609
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,320 
- (car horn)
- He seems to know me.

610
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,880 
- What the fuck?
- (tires squeal)

611
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,400 
- I like your car.
- Thank you.

612
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,400 
- Where'd you get it?
- Are you interested in buying one?

613
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,880 
What, I haven't made
a strong enough impression on you?

614
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,480 
- I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.
- (taps on window)

615
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,120 
(car alarm, car horn)

616
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,320 
OK. So what am I doing?

617
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,520 
(phone rings)

618
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,200 
Who is this?

619
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,880 
(clicks off alarm)

620
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,400 
(activates car alarm)

621
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,120 
Ouch! Cut it out.

622
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,600 
- How can you read that again?
- It's good.

623
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:29,200 
- You've read it, like, a thousand times.
- I enjoy it.

624
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:33,120 
I thought the pleasure of a book was
in wanting to know what happens next.

625
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,480 
Don't be a prick.
I'm not reading it to annoy you. I enjoy it.

626
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,880 
Just let me read. Please?

627
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,520 
Probably tried this before.

628
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,680 
Probably burned truckloads of your stuff.

629
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,200 
Can't remember to forget you.

630
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,200 
Yeah.

631
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,320 
Uh-huh.

632
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:28,400 
Well, sir, that'd certainly be in keeping
with some of my own discoveries.

633
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,520 
I was hoping for more on the drugs angle.
Will you hang on a sec?

634
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,880 
The police report mentioned the drugs
found in the car outside my house.

635
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,880 
The car was stolen.
His prints were all over it.

636
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000 
I got friends in the department.
They gave me a copy.

637
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,880 
I dealt with the police a lot
in my insurance job.

638
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,400 
With my condition it's really tough.
I can't keep it all in mind at once.

639
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,120 
I have to summaries the sections.

640
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,320 
There are pages missing.
I guess I've been trying to log them all.

641
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,520 
I don't know why these are crossed out.

642
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,600 
They weren't even looking for John G.

643
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,320 
The stuff they found in the car fit in with
what they believed had happened,...

644
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,480 
..so they didn't chase it up.

645
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,520 
(door slams)

646
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,680 
Honey?

647
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,120 
Honey, it's late.

648
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,000 
Everything OK?

649
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,680 
(muffled cry)

650
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,800 
(taps on door)

651
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:29,120 
- (muffled gasp)
- You OK in there?

652
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,320 
(sniffs) Was it good for you?

653
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,400 
(laughs softly)

654
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,200 
What? Was I supposed to lock the door?

655
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,120 
(softly) No.

656
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,320 
I'd like you to leave now.

657
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,680 
(clicks off alarm)

658
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,400 
There's something about the drugs
stashed in the car that doesn't ring true.

659
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,480 
The police claim the guy was an addict
needing money to score. It's bullshit.

660
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:16,800 
He's not gonna go breaking into places
while he's still got a stash that big.

661
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,520 
Well, I think John G left it there.
Or planted it there.

662
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,320 
How do you know that?

663
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,120 
Oh, shit, that's true. It fits.

664
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,120 
So he's a dealer.

665
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,600 
Hang on a sec.

666
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,120 
Now we're getting somewhere.

667
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,120 
Discount Inn.

668
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,400 
(activates alarm)

669
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,880 
(activates alarm)

670
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,320 
Yeah, OK.

671
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,400 
Blonde's fine.

672
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,120 
Well, that's what they say.

673
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,120 
The Discount Inn. 304.

674
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,880 
Leonard.

675
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,880 
Well, what then?

676
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,880 
We just go to bed.
You wait for me to fall asleep.

677
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,120 
You go into the bathroom
and slam the door.

678
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,600 
- Slam it?
- Yeah. Loud enough to wake me up.

679
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,520 
- And that's it?
- That's it.

680
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,000 
Ah...

681
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:05,120 
Yeah, first I just need you
to put these things around the room.

682
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:10,120 
Pretend they're your things
and this is your bedroom.

683
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,120 
- Should I wear it?
- No, no, no. Uh, just like you took it off.

684
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,320 
I don't want you to use it. I'm sorry.

685
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:39,200 
I just mean put them around the room,
as if they were your... your things.

686
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,680 
Whatever gets you off.

687
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,200 
(door slams)

688
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,880 
I can't blame the cops
for not taking me seriously.

689
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,800 
This is a difficult condition to understand.
Look at Sammy Jankis.

690
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,880 
His own wife couldn't deal with it.

691
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,480 
I told you how she tried to get him
to snap out of it.

692
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,880 
She came to see me at the office.
I found out all kinds of shit.

693
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,320 
She told me about life with Sammy.
How she treated him.

694
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,800 
Thank you for seeing me.

695
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,400 
She'd get Sammy to hide food
around the house,...

696
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,200 
..then she'd stop feeding him to see
if his hunger would make him remember.

697
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:34,400 
I've taken him to a parking lot and, uh...

698
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,880 
She wasn't a cruel person.
She just wanted her old Sammy back.

699
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,680 
You know all about Sammy
and you've decided he's faking.

700
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,400 
The company's position
isn't that Sammy's faking anything,...

701
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,680 
..just that his condition
can't be shown to be...

702
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,680 
I just want to know
your honest opinion about Sammy.

703
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,520 
We shouldn't be talking like this
while the case is still open to appeal.

704
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,680 
- I'm not appealing the decision.
- Then why are you here?

705
01:00:54,800 --> 01:01:00,480 
Try to understand, when I look at Sammy,
I don't see some... vegetable.

706
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,000 
I see my same old Sammy.

707
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,680 
What do you think that's like for me,...

708
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,880 
..to suspect that he might be imagining
this whole problem?

709
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,880 
That if I just could say the right thing,...

710
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000 
..he'd snap out of it
and go back to being normal.

711
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,320 
If I...

712
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,800 
If I knew that my old Sammy
were truly gone,...

713
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:26,680 
..then I could say goodbye
and start loving this new Sammy.

714
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,400 
As long as I have doubt
I can't say goodbye and move on.

715
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,520 
What do you want from me?

716
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,480 
I want you to forget the company
you work for, for thirty seconds...

717
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,880 
..and tell me if you really believe
that Sammy's faking his condition.

718
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,120 
I need to know...

719
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,600 
..what you honestly believe.

720
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,520 
I believe that Sammy should be physically
capable of making new memories.

721
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,120 
Thank you.

722
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,600 
I thought I'd helped her.

723
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:09,520 
I thought she just needed an answer.
I didn't think it was important what it was.

724
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:12,680 
Just that she had one to believe.

725
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,400 
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?

726
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,200 
- Teddy, your buddy.
- Prove it!

727
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:35,120 
Remember Sammy?
You told me about Sammy!

728
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,600 
- Jeez!
- What the fuck are you doing in my car?

729
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:44,120 
What, your sense of humor went with the
memory? Do you know why you're here?

730
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,120 
- Unfinished business.
- Lenny,...

731
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,880 
..let me inform you,
your business here is very much finished.

732
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,880 
- You're still here because of Natalie.
- Who's Natalie?

733
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,680 
Schmuck! Whose house
do you think you just walked out of?

734
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:02,320 
That's right, take a look at your pictures.
I bet you got one of her.

735
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,520 
Oh, nice shot, Leibovitz(!)

736
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:09,200 
You'll want to make a note.
You can't trust her.

737
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,600 
Why's that?

738
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:13,880 
Because by now
she's taken a look at the suit and the car...

739
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,000 
..and she's figuring out ways
of turning the situation to her advantage.

740
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:23,000 
She's already got you staying with her,
for Christ sakes. You can't go back there.

741
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,880 
Let me give you the name of a motel.

742
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,520 
You're lucky I ran into you.
That broad's bad news.

743
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:31,000 
- What do you mean, ''bad news''?
- She's involved with drugs.

744
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,320 
Look. See these?

745
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:37,200 
This is the bar where she works.
Her boyfriend's a drug dealer.

746
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,880 
She takes orders for him, arranges meets.

747
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,600 
He writes messages
on the back of these,...

748
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:45,200 
..then she slips him the answers
when she serves him his drinks.

749
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:49,120 
- Why should I care?
- Because when she gets jammed up,...

750
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,200 
..she's gonna use you to protect herself.

751
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,680 
From who?

752
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,320 
Guys are gonna wanna know
what happened to her boyfriend.

753
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,600 
Guys are gonna come after her.

754
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,400 
Somebody's got to pay, Lenny.
Somebody always pays.

755
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,800 
Maybe she'll make it you.

756
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:05,320 
Oh, yeah?
Well, maybe she'll make it you. Is that it?

757
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,520 
You worried
that she's gonna use me against you?

758
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,520 
- No.
- Why not?

759
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,400 
Because she doesn't know who I am.

760
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,800 
- Why are you following me?
- Maybe I wanna help.

761
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:19,800 
She doesn't know anything
about your investigation. OK, Einstein?

762
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,000 
So write this down.

763
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,480 
When she offers to help,
it'll be for her own reasons.

764
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,520 
Im not lying.
Take my pen, write this down.

765
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,680 
Do not trust her.

766
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,480 
There. You happy now?

767
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,320 
- I won't be happy until you leave town.
- Why not?

768
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:48,320 
You ever wonder
how long you can hang around here...

769
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,600 
- ..before people start asking questions?
- What sort of questions?

770
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,680 
The same questions
you should be asking yourself.

771
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,400 
- Like what?
- Like how did you get this suit, the car?

772
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:56,880 
- I have money.
- From what?

773
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,200 
My wife's death. I used to work
in insurance. We were well covered.

774
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,120 
Oh!

775
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:06,600 
So in your grief
you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?

776
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:11,680 
You don't have a clue, do you?
You don't even know who you are.

777
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,000 
Yes, I do.

778
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:16,600 
I don't have amnesia. I remember
everything right up until the incident.

779
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,600 
I am Leonard Shelby,
I am from San Francisco...

780
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,680 
That's who you were.

781
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:24,200 
You do not know who you are.
What you've become since...

782
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,680 
..the incident.

783
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:31,600 
You wander around playing detective.
You don't even know how long ago it was.

784
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:37,200 
Let me put it this way. Were you wearing
designer suits when you sold insurance?

785
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:40,880 
- I didn't sell insurance, I investigated it.
- Right, right. You're an investigator.

786
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:46,200 
- Maybe you should investigate yourself.
- Oh, thank you for the advice.

787
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,680 
Look, do me a favor,
don't go back in there.

788
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,400 
Will you take the motel out of town?

789
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,120 
It's been fun, Lenny.

790
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,520 
Do not trust her.

791
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:11,000 
Don't believe his lies.

792
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,480 
Oh, fuck it. I need my own place.

793
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:29,120 
(starts engine)

794
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,000 
No. She shouldn't have given me
that responsibility.

795
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,680 
Im a claims investigator, not a doctor.

796
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,120 
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

797
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,680 
I've got all sorts of other considerations.

798
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:48,120 
Legal responsibility, large financ...

799
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:55,120 
- Who is this?
- (line goes dead)

800
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,800 
Write this down.
Write down what happened.

801
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,320 
Write it down. Come on, concentrate.
Keep it in mind. Find a p...

802
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,120 
- What happened?
- He beat the shit out of me.

803
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,600 
Who?

804
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,120 
Who?

805
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,680 
Fuck, Leonard, Dodd!
Dodd beat the shit out of me.

806
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:25,880 
Why?

807
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,320 
Because of you! Because I did what
you told me to do, reason with him,...

808
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,800 
- ..tell him about Teddy. Great idea!
- Calm down. Calm down, take it easy.

809
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,600 
You're safe. Its OK.

810
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:39,320 
Come on. Just sit down. Sit down.

811
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,480 
Here, sit down.

812
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000 
OK. You're OK.

813
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,800 
I'll just get some ice for your face.

814
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,320 
Here.

815
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:05,000 
I did exactly what you told me to do.

816
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:07,120 
I went to Dodd...

817
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,320 
..and I told him
that I didn't have any of Jimmy's money,...

818
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,480 
..or the drugs.

819
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:18,800 
And that this Teddy
must have taken everything.

820
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,400 
And what did he say?

821
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,880 
He didn't believe me.

822
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,880 
He said if I don't have the drugs
by tomorrow, he's gonna kill me.

823
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,800 
And then he just...
he just started hitting me.

824
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,520 
Where is he?

825
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,400 
- Why?
- Ill go see him.

826
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:42,600 
Ill give him some bruises of his own
and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.

827
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,000 
Oh, he'll kill you, Lenny.

828
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:50,200 
- My wife used to call me Lenny.
- Yeah?

829
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,680 
Yeah, I hated it.

830
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:58,480 
Oh, this guy is so dangerous.
Let's just think of something else, OK?

831
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:02,680 
No, no, no.
You just tell me what he looks like.

832
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,320 
And where I can find him.
Have you got a pen?

833
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,120 
In my purse.

834
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,520 
He'll, um,... he'll probably find you.

835
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:20,880 
What do you mean?

836
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,800 
I told him about your car.

837
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,480 
Why?

838
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,800 
He was beating the shit out of me,
I had to tell him something.

839
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,320 
Just write it all down.

840
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,800 
Be careful.

841
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000 
Ill be fine.

842
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,680 
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?

843
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,480 
(phone rings)

844
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,120 
(phone rings)

845
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,880 
Front desk? Burt, right.
This is Mr. Shelby in room 21 .

846
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,800 
Yeah, that's it, I don't want any calls.

847
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,880 
No, none at all.

848
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:31,680 
(door opens)

849
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,320 
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.

850
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,320 
- Who?
- Calls himself Dodd.

851
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:40,800 
What does he want?

852
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,680 
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy
and his money. He thinks I took it.

853
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:44,800 
Did you?

854
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,120 
No.

855
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,480 
- What's this all about?
- You don't have a fucking clue, do you?

856
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,680 
You're just blissfully ignorant, aren't you?

857
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,320 
- Look, I have this condition.
- I know all about your fucking condition!

858
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,800 
I probably know more about it than you,
you don't have a clue about anything else.

859
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:07,600 
- What happened?
- Jimmy went to meet a guy named Teddy.

860
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,320 
He took a lot of money with him
and never came back.

861
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,200 
Jimmy's partners think I set him up.
I don't know if you know this Teddy.

862
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,400 
- Neither do I.
- Don't protect him! Help me.

863
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:19,400 
- How?
- Get rid of Dodd for me.

864
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,880 
- What?
- Kill him. Ill pay you.

865
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,880 
What do you think I am?
Im not gonna kill someone for money.

866
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,480 
What, then? Love?
What would you kill for?

867
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,200 
- You'd kill for your wife, wouldn't you?
- That's different.

868
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,800 
- Not to me, I wasn't married to her!
- Hey, don't talk about my wife.

869
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,800 
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want!

870
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,320 
I can say whatever I want
and you won't remember!

871
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,400 
I can call your wife a fucking whore
and we can still be friends.

872
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,120 
- Calm down.
- You can't get scared!

873
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,680 
You don't know how, you fucking idiot!

874
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,680 
This has nothing to do with me.

875
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:51,600 
How the fuck would you know?
You don't know a fucking thing!

876
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:54,800 
- Hey, can you get angry?
- Yes.

877
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:57,120 
You pathetic piece of shit!

878
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:02,480 
I can say whatever the fuck I want and
you won't have a clue, you fucking retard!

879
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:06,600 
Im gonna use you. Im telling you now
because Im gonna enjoy it much more...

880
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:10,600 
..if I know that you could stop me
if you weren't such a fucking freak.

881
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:13,120 
Did you lose your pen? Too bad, freak.

882
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:17,000 
Otherwise you could write yourself a note
about how much Natalie hates your guts...

883
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,880 
..and that I called your wife a whore!

884
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,880 
- Don't say another fucking word!
- About your whore of a wife?

885
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:27,320 
I read about your condition, Leonard.

886
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:32,600 
You know one of the causes of short-term
memory loss? Venereal disease.

887
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,480 
Maybe your cunt of a fucking wife...

888
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:38,120 
..sucked one too many diseased cocks
and turned you into a retard!

889
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:42,600 
(softly) You sad, sad freak.

890
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:49,800 
I can say whatever the fuck I want
and you won't remember.

891
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:53,200 
We'll still be best friends.

892
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,120 
Or maybe even lovers.

893
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,320 
Fuck!

894
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,200 
Ill see you soon.

895
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,880 
- (door opens and closes)
- Stay focused.

896
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,880 
Find a pen.

897
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,400 
Im gonna write this down.
Im gonna write it down.

898
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:24,120 
Concentrate, concentrate, concentrate.

899
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:27,520 
Keep it in mind,
keep it in mind, keep it in mind.

900
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:32,000 
Come on. Ive got to find a pen.
Ive got to find a pen.

901
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:35,880 
Now, write this down, write this down.
Exactly what happened.

902
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,600 
Im gonna write down what happened.
Come on, come on! Ive got to find a pen!

903
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,520 
Jeez! Come on! Come on, keep focused.

904
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:42,480 
Keep focused.

905
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,120 
Keep... Keep it in mind.
Come on, find a pen.

906
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,600 
Write this note.
Write down what happened. Write it down.

907
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,880 
Come on, concentrate.
Keep it in mind. Find a p...

908
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:00,320 
What happened?

909
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,400 
What does it look like?
He beat the shit out of me.

910
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,400 
- Who?
- Who?

911
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,680 
Fuck, Leonard, Dodd!
Dodd beat the shit out of me.

912
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,000 
- (knock at door)
- Hello?

913
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,400 
Its Burt, from the front desk.

914
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,400 
Yeah?

915
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:30,600 
I know you said you didn't want any calls
but this guy on the phone says he's a cop.

916
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,680 
- A cop?
- Yeah.

917
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,880 
He says you're really gonna wanna know
what he has to say.

918
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,120 
Im not too good on the phone.
I need to look people in the eye.

919
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,680 
Well, what...

920
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:47,320 
You can, um, you can crash on the couch.

921
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,120 
Its comfortable. Just have a seat.

922
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,880 
Thanks.

923
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:59,000 
So, how long do you think
it's gonna take you?

924
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,400 
Hmm?

925
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:03,800 
You told me you were looking
for the guy who killed your wife.

926
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:09,880 
Oh, it depends on if he's here in town
or if he's moved on. I have my file here.

927
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,680 
Can I ask you something?

928
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:19,000 
lf you have all that information,
why haven't the police found him for you?

929
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:22,320 
- They're not looking for him.
- Why not?

930
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,880 
They don't think he exists.

931
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:30,880 
You see, I told them what I remembered.
I was asleep. Something woke me up.

932
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,320 
(clock ticks)

933
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:39,880 
Her side of the bed was cold.
She'd obviously been gone for a while.

934
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,680 
(muffled cry)

935
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,120 
(muffled cry)

936
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,120 
(muffled cry)

937
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:15,680 
(crash)

938
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,200 
There had to be a second man.

939
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,800 
Somebody hit me from behind.
I remember.

940
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,480 
Its the last thing I do remember.

941
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,120 
Look, the police didn't believe me.
lf we check...

942
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,880 
How did they explain what you
do remember? The gun and stuff?

943
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,600 
John G was clever.

944
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,680 
He was clever.

945
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:00,480 
He took the dead man's gun and
replaced it with the sap he hit me with.

946
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:04,480 
He left my gun and the getaway car.
He gave the police a complete package.

947
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:09,120 
They found the sap with my blood on it
in the dead man's hand.

948
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,520 
And they only found my gun.

949
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,400 
They didn't need to look for anybody else.

950
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:18,200 
I was the only guy who disagreed
with the facts and I had brain damage.

951
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,000 
The cops are not gonna believe
someone in my condition.

952
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:25,680 
Leonard. You can stay here
for a couple of days if it will help you.

953
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,320 
Oh, thanks.

954
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:32,800 
I have to go back to work,
so, um, just make yourself at home.

955
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:35,200 
You can watch TV or have some food.

956
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:37,680 
Whatever you want, OK?
Make yourself at home.

957
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,320 
One thing.

958
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:46,880 
- Something to remember you by.
- My name is Natalie.

959
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,400 
Natalie.

960
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,680 
(door opens)

961
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,000 
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.

962
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,320 
(phone rings)

963
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,480 
(phone rings)

964
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,680 
(ringing stops)

965
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:07,680 
(phone rings)

966
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:13,320 
- On the house.
- Thanks.

967
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,320 
(laughs)

968
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:21,200 
My, you really do have a problem.
Just like that cop said.

969
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:24,480 
- Hmm?
- Your condition.

970
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:27,400 
Well, nobody's perfect.

971
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:31,680 
What's the last thing
that you do remember?

972
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,800 
- My wife.
- That's sweet.

973
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:37,680 
Dying.

974
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,880 
I remember my wife dying.

975
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:48,200 
Let me, um, get you another one.

976
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,120 
I think this one's dusty.

977
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:57,000 
Why are you calling me?
What do you want?

978
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:00,480 
I know you're a cop. What do you want?
Have I done something wrong?

979
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,120 
I don't know, something bad, maybe.

980
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,800 
Look, why are you asking me?
I can't remember what Ive done.

981
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,880 
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

982
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,800 
Because of my condition, you don't
believe someone with this condition.

983
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:14,480 
Nobody believed Sammy!
I didn't even fucking believe Sammy!

984
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:17,200 
Ferdy's bar.

985
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:21,680 
Come by after. Natalie.

986
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,880 
- A beer, please.
- What do you want?

987
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:38,880 
A beer, please.

988
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,320 
You can't just waltz in here
dressed like that and ask for a beer.

989
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,680 
- What, is there a dress code?
- Why are you here?

990
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:46,600 
- Im meeting someone called Natalie.
- Well, that's me.

991
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,320 
Yeah, we met before, right?

992
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,320 
- Then why am I here?
- I don't know, why don't you tell me?

993
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,320 
I don't remember.
I have no short-term memory.

994
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,120 
Oh, you're that memory guy.

995
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:59,800 
- How do you know about me?
- My boyfriend told me about you.

996
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:03,600 
- Oh, yeah? Who's your boyfriend?
- Jimmy Grants. Do you know him?

997
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,120 
No.

998
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:11,400 
He knows you. He told me about you.
He said you were staying at the Discount.

999
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:14,600 
In fact, a cop came by earlier
and was looking for you.

1000
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,680 
Said he was looking for a guy
who can't remember anything,...

1001
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,680 
..wouldn't know how he'd got here
or what he'd done.

1002
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,680 
I get a lot of guys round here like that.

1003
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:25,000 
Chronic alcoholism
is one cause of short-term memory loss.

1004
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:29,600 
- Are you Teddy?
- No, my name's Leonard.

1005
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,680 
- Did Teddy send you?
- I don't know.

1006
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,320 
What's happened to Jimmy?

1007
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,880 
- I don't know that, either. Sorry.
- You don't remember anything?

1008
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,520 
You don't remember where you've been
or what you've just done?

1009
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,880 
I can't make new memories.
Everything just fades.

1010
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,680 
- Then why did you come here?
- I found this in my pocket.

1011
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,880 
Your pocket?

1012
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:08,800 
(man hawks)

1013
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,880 
Bar bet. Care to contribute?

1014
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,400 
- No, thanks.
- Its for a lot of money.

1015
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:25,520 
Come on. Proceeds are going to charity.
Help me out.

1016
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,480 
(hawks)

1017
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,120 
Thank you.

1018
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,320 
- On the house.
- Thanks.

1019
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:00,120 
(man laughs)

1020
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,400 
Its completely fucked
because nobody believes you.

1021
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:08,000 
Its amazing what a little brain damage
will do for your credibility.

1022
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,320 
I guess it's poetic justice
for not believing Sammy.

1023
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:15,000 
You know the truth about my condition,
officer? You don't know anything.

1024
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:19,880 
You feel angry, you don't know why.
You feel guilty, you have no idea why.

1025
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,400 
You could do anything and not have
the faintest idea ten minutes later.

1026
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,320 
Like Sammy.
What if I'd done something like Sammy?

1027
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:30,200 
I didn't tell you?
What happened to Sammy and his wife?

1028
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,320 
She came to see me at my office.

1029
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:37,120 
I didn't tell her what I really thought
but I never said that he was faking.

1030
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:39,320 
Just that his condition was mental,
not physical.

1031
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,880 
I found out later that she went home
and gave Sammy his final exam.

1032
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:46,400 
Sammy? Its time for my shot.

1033
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,680 
She knew beyond a doubt
that he loved her,

1034
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,400 
so she found a way to test him.

1035
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,320 
Sammy? Its time for my shot.

1036
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:25,200 
Hmm.

1037
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,800 
- She really thought she'd call his bluff.
- There you go.

1038
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:40,400 
Or she just didn't want to live with
the things she'd put him through.

1039
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,120 
Sammy?

1040
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:53,600 
Its time for my shot.

1041
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,200 
It won't hurt.

1042
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:46,400 
She went into a coma
and never recovered.

1043
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:49,600 
Sammy couldn't understand
or explain what happened.

1044
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:50,680 
Oh!

1045
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:56,000 
He's been in a home ever since.
He doesn't even know his wife is dead.

1046
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:59,320 
I was wrong about Sammy
and I was wrong about his wife.

1047
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:03,400 
She wasn't interested in the money.
She needed to understand his problem.

1048
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:07,120 
His brain didn't respond to conditioning
but he wasn't a con man.

1049
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:10,400 
And when she looked into his eyes,
she thought he could be the same person.

1050
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,480 
When I looked into his eyes,
I thought I saw recognition.

1051
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,480 
Now I know you fake it.

1052
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:17,600 
lf you think you're supposed to recognize
somebody, you pretend to.

1053
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:21,120 
You bluff it to get a pat on the head
from the doctors.

1054
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,120 
You bluff it to seem less of a freak.

1055
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,680 
What drug dealer?

1056
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,480 
(tires squeal)

1057
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:55,320 
- Hey, Lenny, how you doing?
- Its private back here.

1058
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:58,320 
- Its OK, we know each other. Right, kid?
- How did you know I was in here?

1059
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,320 
The Jag's out front.

1060
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:03,200 
What are you still doing here, Lenny?
There's plenty of tattoo parlors up north.

1061
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:06,680 
I guess I wanted to get something down
before it slipped my mind.

1062
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,600 
- Give me the keys, Ill move it.
- It'll be all right.

1063
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:10,680 
- Wait out there.
- Oh, for Christ...

1064
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,800 
Give me a minute,
Ive got to get something for you.

1065
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:20,600 
Fact six. Car license SG13 7lU.

1066
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:29,680 
Look, wait a minute, will ya?

1067
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,400 
- We gotta get you out of here.
- Why?

1068
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:37,320 
Oh, man. Come on, Leonard.
How many times I gotta tell you?

1069
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,800 
- Its not safe for you to hang around.
- Why not?

1070
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:43,120 
Because that cop's looking for you.
I gotta get you a new identity,...

1071
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:46,400 
..some new clothes, a different car
would do for now. Put these on.

1072
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,320 
Whoa, whoa. What cop?

1073
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:52,320 
He's a bad cop. He's the one
that checked you into the Discount Inn.

1074
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:56,120 
He's been calling you for days, slipping
envelopes under your door, shit like that.

1075
01:27:56,200 --> 01:28:00,000 
- How do you know this?
- He told me. He's been laughing at you.

1076
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:01,520 
- You're full of shit.
- No, Im not.

1077
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,520 
He knows you're no good on the phone
so he's been calling you up.

1078
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,520 
Sometimes you don't answer the phone...

1079
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,320 
..so he slips shit under your door
to scare you into answering it,...

1080
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:13,320 
..giving you a line of crap about John G
being a local drug dealer. Jimmy Grants.

1081
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:16,120 
- Who's Jimmy Grants?
- Leonard, Jimmy's the drug dealer.

1082
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:19,520 
The cop wants to know how his operation
is run. He's got some score in mind.

1083
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,000 
- Somehow you're involved.
- How do you know him?

1084
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:27,520 
Im a snitch. He's a cop from out of town.
The local boys put us together.

1085
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:29,880 
lf he knew I was helping you,
he'd fucking kill me.

1086
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,600 
So take these clothes, put them on
and get the fuck out of here.

1087
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:35,520 
Come on, Leonard, just go.

1088
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,800 
You are full of shit.

1089
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,520 
Come by after. Natalie.

1090
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,000 
Ferdy's bar.

1091
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,120 
(knocks on window)

1092
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:46,320 
Hey, Jimmy.

1093
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:50,800 
Im sorry, I, uh,
thought you were somebody else.

1094
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:52,880 
Sorry.

1095
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000 
That's OK.

1096
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:12,120 
This Jimmy Grants deals drugs
out of the bar where his girlfriend works?

1097
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:16,000 
But he's not going to bring her along?
He'll come by himself, right?

1098
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:19,800 
I always figured the drugs angle
would be the best way to get him.

1099
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,320 
No, officer. Im as ready as Ill ever be.

1100
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:26,200 
You're in the lobby?
What do you look like?

1101
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:28,320 
Ill be right there.

1102
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:10,600 
Lenny!

1103
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,680 
Officer Gammell?

1104
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:19,520 
Yeah. Come on.

1105
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,480 
- Hey, smile.
- Oh, don't, uh... Not here.

1106
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:41,200 
Over here.

1107
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,120 
Is it Officer or Lieutenant Gammell?

1108
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:51,120 
You know what?
Don't write Gammell, just Teddy.

1109
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:53,680 
- Why?
- Im undercover.

1110
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,880 
This is the directions, where he's going.

1111
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,680 
- My number's on the bottom if you...
- You're not coming?

1112
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:04,480 
Nah, it wouldn't be appropriate.

1113
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,880 
Nice picture. I look thin.

1114
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:14,880 
Hey, Lenny!

1115
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:17,680 
Make him beg.

1116
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,880 
Teddy!

1117
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,120 
Hey, Teddy!

1118
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,680 
Teddy!

1119
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:51,520 
Jimmy.

1120
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,120 
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- You Jimmy Grants?

1121
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:57,120 
Expecting any other Jimmys,
memory man?

1122
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:01,320 
- Do you remember me?
- Yeah, I remember you.

1123
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:03,680 
Where the fuck's Teddy?

1124
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:04,800 
Well?

1125
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:10,120 
Motherfuck!

1126
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,000 
What are you doing?

1127
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:14,320 
Strip.

1128
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,680 
- You're making a big fucking mistake!
- Strip!

1129
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:21,200 
My associates are not the kind of people
you wanna piss off.

1130
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:22,880 
Don't say anything else.

1131
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,800 
- I knew I couldn't trust that fuck!
- Take it off.

1132
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:32,880 
Your pants, too.

1133
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,400 
- Why?
- I don't wanna get blood on them.

1134
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:39,320 
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait, wait, wait!
Did he tell you what I was bringing?

1135
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:43,200 
- Take your fuckin' pants off!
- Ive got two hundred grand in the car!

1136
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:45,800 
- Just take it!
- You think you can bargain with me?

1137
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:48,120 
- Just take the money and walk away.
- I don't want your fucking money.

1138
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:50,480 
Then, what?

1139
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:53,800 
- What do you want from me?
- I want my fucking life back!

1140
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:22,680 
(softly) Sammy.

1141
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:31,200 
He said Sammy.
How does he know about Sammy?

1142
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:33,320 
Oh, fuck.

1143
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,320 
What have I done?

1144
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:56,680 
Hey, mister! I need help!

1145
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:00,200 
There's a guy in here, he's hurt bad.
We gotta get him to a doctor.

1146
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:01,400 
All right.

1147
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:04,800 
I don't know what happened.
Ive got this memory thing.

1148
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:07,680 
- Do I know you?
- No. Don't worry, Im a cop.

1149
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:10,880 
- Is he still breathing?
- Well, I don't know. Maybe.

1150
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,800 
- What the hell were you guys doing?
- I don't remember, I have this condition.

1151
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:18,800 
I hope it's not as serious as his
cuz this guy's dead.

1152
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:22,880 
- Ow! Lenny! That shit kills!
- So you remember me now, huh?

1153
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:27,520 
- You are a fucking cop!
- And Im the guy that helped you find him.

1154
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:31,880 
- Get up! Get up!
- Lenny, you got the wrong idea!

1155
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:36,600 
Who is that? He knew me.

1156
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:39,320 
Of course he did, he raped your wife,
he fucked up your brain.

1157
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:41,320 
Bullshit! He's not the guy.

1158
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:45,120 
His name is James F Grants. John G.
Check your tattoos.

1159
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:47,800 
- Why did he bring two hundred grand?
- What?

1160
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:51,880 
- What was it for?
- Amphetamines I told him I had.

1161
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,400 
- Is this a drug deal?
- No. Yeah, that and your thing.

1162
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:58,880 
Look, Jimmy's your guy. I figured
we'd make a few dollars on the side.

1163
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,680 
- How did he know me?
- The Discount Inn.

1164
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:06,000 
He dealt out of there. The guy at the front
desk let him know if anybody came round.

1165
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:08,320 
He called Jimmy
the minute he saw you taking a picture.

1166
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,680 
- You're fucking using me.
- No! You get half.

1167
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:13,120 
He knew about Sammy,
why would I tell him about Sammy?!

1168
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:16,480 
You tell everybody about Sammy!
Everybody who'll listen!

1169
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:18,600 
''Remember Sammy Jankis?''
''Remember Sammy Jankis?''

1170
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:21,520 
Great story.
Gets better every time you tell it.

1171
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:25,520 
So you lie to yourself to be happy.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1172
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:29,320 
We all do it. Who cares if there's a few
little details you'd rather not remember?

1173
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:33,880 
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I don't know.

1174
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:38,680 
Your wife surviving the assault.
Her not believing your condition.

1175
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:42,480 
The torment and pain and anguish
tearing her up inside.

1176
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:45,000 
The insulin.

1177
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,880 
That's Sammy, not me.
I told you about Sammy.

1178
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,800 
Yeah, right.
Like you tell yourself over and over again.

1179
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:55,320 
Conditioning yourself to remember,
learning through repetition.

1180
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:58,120 
Sammy let his wife kill herself.
Sammy ended up in an institution.

1181
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:01,320 
Sammy was a con man. A faker.

1182
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:03,520 
I never said that Sammy was faking.

1183
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:06,320 
You exposed him for what he was.
A fraud.

1184
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,320 
I was wrong. That's the whole point.

1185
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:12,600 
- See, Sammy's wife came to me...
- Sammy didn't have a wife.

1186
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:17,880 
It was your wife who had diabetes.

1187
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:24,480 
Ouch!

1188
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:28,680 
My wife wasn't diabetic.

1189
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:31,320 
You sure?

1190
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,520 
Ouch! Cut it out!

1191
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,520 
She wasn't diabetic.

1192
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:43,200 
You think I don't know my own wife?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1193
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:46,320 
I guess I can only make you remember
the things you want to be true.

1194
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,880 
- Like old Jimmy down there.
- He's not the right guy.

1195
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,120 
He was to you.

1196
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:54,400 
Come on, you got your revenge.
Enjoy it while you still remember.

1197
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:56,880 
What difference does it make
whether he was your guy or not?

1198
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000 
- It makes all the difference.
- Why? You're never gonna know.

1199
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:00,800 
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't.

1200
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:03,200 
- Somehow Ill know.
- You won't remember!

1201
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:04,680 
When it's done, I will know.

1202
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:07,680 
I thought so, too, I was sure of it,
but you didn't!

1203
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:16,000 
That's right. The real John G.
I helped you find him over a year ago.

1204
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:18,880 
- He's already dead.
- Don't lie to me any more.

1205
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,880 
Look, Lenny,...

1206
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,120 
..I was the cop assigned
to your wife's case, I believed you.

1207
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:26,600 
I thought you deserved
a chance for revenge.

1208
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:29,880 
Im the one that helped you find
the other guy in your bathroom that night.

1209
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,120 
The guy that cracked your skull
and fucked your wife.

1210
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:34,480 
We found him, you killed him.

1211
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:37,880 
But you didn't remember.

1212
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:43,520 
So I helped you start looking again,
looking for the guy you already killed.

1213
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:48,120 
- Oh, yeah? So who was he?
- Just some guy. Does it matter who?

1214
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:52,480 
No reason, Lenny, no conspiracy,
just bad fucking luck.

1215
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:56,200 
Couple of junkies too strung out
to realize your wife didn't live alone.

1216
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:01,880 
But when you killed him
I was so convinced that you'd remember.

1217
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:05,000 
But it didn't stick.

1218
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:07,200 
Like nothing ever sticks,
like this won't stick.

1219
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:13,200 
I took that picture.

1220
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,400 
Just when you did it.

1221
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:22,880 
Look how happy you are.
I wanted to see that face again.

1222
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,320 
- Oh, gee, thanks(!)
- Fuck you.

1223
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:29,320 
I gave you a reason to live
and you were more than happy to help.

1224
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:34,880 
You don't want the truth. You make up
your own truth, like your police file.

1225
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:38,600 
It was complete when I gave it to you.
Who took out the twelve pages?

1226
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:40,000 
You, probably.

1227
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:42,400 
- No, it wasn't me, see, it was you.
- Why would I do that?

1228
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:45,200 
To create a puzzle you could never solve.

1229
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:47,200 
Do you know how many towns,...

1230
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:51,320 
..how many John Gs or James Gs?
I mean, shit, Lenny, Im a fucking John G.

1231
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:54,480 
- Your name's Teddy.
- My mother calls me Teddy.

1232
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:56,480 
My name's John Edward Gammell.

1233
01:41:56,600 --> 01:42:01,120 
Cheer up. There's plenty of John Gs
for us to find.

1234
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:08,680 
All you do is moan! Im the one
that has to live with what you've done.

1235
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,680 
Im the one that put it all together.

1236
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:15,320 
You, you wander around, you're playing
detective. You're living a dream, kid.

1237
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:18,320 
A dead wife to pine for,
a sense of purpose to your life,...

1238
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:22,600 
..a romantic quest that you wouldn't end
even if I wasn't in the picture.

1239
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:26,880 
- I should kill you.
- Quit it! Lenny, come on.

1240
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,800 
You're not a killer.
That's why you're so good at it.

1241
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:33,800 
Come on, what are you doing?

1242
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:37,880 
You know what time it is?
Its beer o'clock, Im buying.

1243
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:41,600 
Fuck!

1244
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:51,680 
Im not a killer.

1245
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,320 
I'm just someone
who wanted to make things right.

1246
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:04,200 
Can I just let myself forget
what you've told me?

1247
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,880 
Can I just let myself forget
what you made me do?

1248
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:41,400 
You think I just want another puzzle
to solve? Another John G to look for?

1249
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:43,680 
You're a John G.

1250
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:48,120 
So you can be my John G.

1251
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:58,800 
Do I lie to myself to be happy?

1252
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:00,200 
In your case, Teddy,...

1253
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:04,200 
..yes, I will.

1254
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:18,200 
Hey! Hey, that's not your car!

1255
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:21,200 
- It is now.
- Jesus Christ, you can't take it!

1256
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:23,520 
- Why not?
- Because the guy you just killed owns it!

1257
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:25,800 
Somebody'll recognize it.

1258
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:30,200 
You know, I think Id rather
be mistaken for a dead guy than a killer.

1259
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:33,520 
I might hang on to this for a while.

1260
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,120 
Lenny.

1261
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:38,600 
Look, don't...
Will you help me find the keys?

1262
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:41,680 
Help me find my keys!

1263
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:42,480 
Lenny!

1264
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:49,520 
Lenny!

1265
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:06,320 
I have to believe in a world
outside my own mind.

1266
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,320 
I have to believe
that my actions still have meaning.

1267
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:11,320 
Even if I can't remember them.

1268
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:17,000 
I have to believe that when my eyes
are closed, the world's still here.

1269
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:20,480 
Do I believe the world's still here?

1270
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:24,800 
Is it still out there?

1271
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:29,520 
Yeah.

1272
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:34,400 
We all need memories
to remind ourselves who we are.

1273
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:38,320 
Im no different.

1274
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:42,480 
(tires screech)

1275
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:52,000 
Now, where was I?

1276
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:03,680 
# We lay in each other's arms

1277
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:09,400 
# But the room is just an empty space

1278
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:12,600 
# I guess we lived it out

1279
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:16,400 
# Something in the air

1280
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:18,600 
# We smile too fast

1281
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:22,000 
# Then can't think of a thing to say

1282
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:26,400 
# Lived with the best times

1283
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,880 
# Left with the worst

1284
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:37,320 
# Ive danced with you too long

1285
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:42,000 
# Nothing left to save

1286
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:47,320 
# There's something in the air

1287
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:51,880 
# Something in my eye

1288
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,000 
# Ive danced with you too long

1289
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:59,120 
# Yeah

1290
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:03,320 
# Something in the air

1291
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:07,880 
# Something in my eye

1292
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,600 
# Abracadoo

1293
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:23,680 
# I lose you

1294
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:27,880 
# We can't avoid the clash

1295
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:30,120 
# The big mistake

1296
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,120 
# Now we're gonna pay and pay

1297
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:41,320 
# I guess you know
I never wanted anyone more than you

1298
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:45,520 
# Lived all our best times

1299
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,400 
# Left with the worst

1300
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:56,320 
# Ive danced with you too long

1301
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:01,320 
# Say what you will

1302
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:06,680 
# But there's something in the air

1303
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,400 
# Something in my eye

1304
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:15,800 
# Ive danced with you too long

1305
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:21,880 
# There's something I have to say

1306
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:26,800 
# There's something in the air

1307
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:31,200 
# Ive danced with you too long #
