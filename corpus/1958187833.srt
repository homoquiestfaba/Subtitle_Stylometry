1
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:06,574
<i>The war between</i>
<i>the Z-Bots and humans</i>

2
00:00:06,608 --> 00:00:08,710
<i>raged 300 years ago.</i>

3
00:00:08,743 --> 00:00:13,313
<i>Their firepower overwhelmed</i>
<i>the unprepared human race.</i>

4
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,183
<i>These robots were programmed</i>

5
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,520
<i>to erase all the living things</i>
<i>on Earth.</i>

6
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:23,423
<i>Slowly we began to find</i>
<i>ways to fight back.</i>

7
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:25,760
<i>Our scientists</i>
<i>developed a scramble drive</i>

8
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:27,361
<i>that could be jammed</i>
<i>into the Z-Bots</i>

9
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,062
<i>and make them immobile.</i>

10
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:32,466
<i>The Z-Bot central command</i>
<i>figured out our tactics</i>

11
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:35,703
<i>and began to concentrate their</i>
<i>attack on our science center.</i>

12
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:38,338
<i>We had to adjust our plans</i>

13
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:41,108
<i>and figure out</i>
<i>another way to fight back.</i>

14
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,810
<i>The human race</i>
<i>moved underground</i>

15
00:00:42,844 --> 00:00:45,379
<i>to survive</i>
<i>the robotic genocide.</i>

16
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,448
<i>We did what we needed to do</i>
<i>to make it to another day.</i>

17
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:53,588
<i>And somehow the hope</i>
<i>of life continued.</i>

18
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:56,524
<i>Our soldiers fought bravely,</i>
<i>but we were outgunned,</i>

19
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:58,458
<i>so we had to come up</i>
<i>with a solution</i>

20
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:01,361
<i>to stop them once and for all.</i>

21
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,264
<i>We created a mega-EMP bomb,</i>

22
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:07,301
<i>the magnitude of which</i>
<i>we could never imagine,</i>

23
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:08,770
<i>but it would mean</i>
<i>that we would erase</i>

24
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:10,572
<i>everything we've ever known</i>

25
00:01:10,605 --> 00:01:13,307
<i>and that we would have to</i>
<i>start from the very beginning.</i>

26
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,679
<i>And on Liberation Day,</i>
<i>we put our plan into action.</i>

27
00:01:17,712 --> 00:01:19,446
<i>The Z-Bots ceased to operate,</i>

28
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,616
<i>and we were free</i>
<i>to build our world back,</i>

29
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:25,152
<i>back to a time where we could</i>
<i>be free to live our lives.</i>

30
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:28,155
<i>Little did we know that</i>
<i>the Z-Bot central command</i>

31
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:31,759
<i>was infected by alien nanobot</i>
<i>technology which lay dormant</i>

32
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:34,896
<i>in the scattered ruins</i>
<i>of their destroyed carcasses,</i>

33
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:39,366
<i>where they waited</i>
<i>for their time to strike back.</i>

34
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:14,996
Why is the alarm sounding?

35
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,581
What?

36
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,517
Diagnostic alpha.

37
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:48,596
Control Team...

38
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:51,866
I'm showing a major
firewall breach at the plant.

39
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:55,503
We have a code Z at the plant.
Do you copy?

40
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:57,772
Alpha negate.

41
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:00,575
Propagate
Apex Predator Function.

42
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:09,751
I repeat--
We have a code Z! Code Z!

43
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:11,853
Do you copy?! Control Team!

44
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:16,456
Juniper! This is
the Los Angeles City

45
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,592
Power Control Team!

46
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,493
We have confirmed
a firewall breach

47
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:21,294
and have already alerted HQ,

48
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,531
but this is not
a standard breach!

49
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,066
We need any details
you can provide!

50
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:27,068
Mila, run diagnostics check.

51
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,536
Running now.

52
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,403
HQ, do you come in?!

53
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:31,939
Is this another Z-Bot attack

54
00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:33,741
ripping through
the power station?

55
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:35,475
HQ, do you copy?!

56
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,844
This isn't a Z-Bot code.

57
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:38,411
This is something new.

58
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,313
Oh, my God.

59
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:42,349
It's heading straight
for the plant turbines.

60
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,619
I'm implementing
an ad hoc defense code ASAP.

61
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:45,686
Ask for HQ protocol.

62
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,021
If we cannot
get ahold of them,

63
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,623
we have to stop this attack.

64
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:51,058
Per protocol,
we need a sliding base

65
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:53,493
and alternate
between quinary and hex.

66
00:04:53,528 --> 00:04:55,530
The default should be
a malware function,

67
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:56,597
full attack.

68
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:57,899
It's already rerouting power.

69
00:04:57,932 --> 00:04:59,466
Send the ad hoc code through...

70
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,868
now!

71
00:05:00,902 --> 00:05:03,470
If it reroutes the power
station to the entire grid,

72
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:06,908
we and HQ will be
totally powerless

73
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:08,709
against another robot attack.

74
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:12,079
Per protocol,
we're gonna have to implement

75
00:05:12,113 --> 00:05:14,515
a full code attack
just to contain it.

76
00:05:14,549 --> 00:05:16,851
Well, do it! Send it now!
We have to stop this thing!

77
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:19,386
If it gets out of the plant,
it'll be at the city

78
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,755
in a manner of minutes,
maybe less.

79
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:24,859
This buys HQ maybe
five minutes to respond

80
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:26,060
if we're lucky.

81
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:27,528
Oh, no.

82
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:28,963
It's aimed right at us.

83
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,430
We're under attack!

84
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,799
Code Z! Code Z!

85
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,868
Juniper! This is
Kensley at Command!

86
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:37,071
You need to evacuate
the plant immediately!

87
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:39,707
Juniper, get out
of the plant now!

88
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,910
It's fully overriding
the system.

89
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:44,979
It's breached everything!

90
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,114
There's nothing we can do
to stop this!

91
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:50,785
HQ! HQ! Come in, HQ!

92
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:53,788
We've confirmed
a full firewall breach!

93
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,556
The robots are back.

94
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,924
The robots are back!

95
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,611
Well, well, well.

96
00:06:50,645 --> 00:06:52,747
Look what we have here.

97
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,981
Man, I've not shot a Z-Bot

98
00:06:54,015 --> 00:06:56,150
with one of these things
in a long time.

99
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,052
It's been almost 20 years.

100
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,155
I just can't believe we found
another fully stocked bunker.

101
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:03,157
Hey, I told you
we could have fought the war

102
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,227
for another decade the way
we kept this place stocked.

103
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,996
Just imagine what we're
gonna have in a few years.

104
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,564
Like what?

105
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:11,933
Aboveground farms?

106
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:14,669
Yes, and the city
is gonna be active

107
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:16,037
with the...

108
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:19,472
Restaurants.

109
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:20,808
Restaurants.

110
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:24,245
People out just enjoying food,
not rationing it.

111
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,580
Music concerts. Sports.

112
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:28,916
And we could do
one of those, um...

113
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,252
What's the old-world term?

114
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,887
Uh...

115
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,955
Night on the town.

116
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:36,624
Yeah.

117
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:38,092
Things from before the war.

118
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,795
Guys.

119
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:42,797
We're not gonna have
a night out on the town

120
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,998
if we don't keep working.

121
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:48,002
Besides, my pen's
almost out of ink.

122
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:50,604
I should have brought a backup.

123
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:52,506
Maybe you should try
going digital instead.

124
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,709
You might get
an accurate count this time.

125
00:07:54,742 --> 00:07:56,911
Maybe you should spend
less time on your tablet.

126
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,512
Isn't that contraband?

127
00:07:58,546 --> 00:07:59,680
Yeah, and the war's been over

128
00:07:59,714 --> 00:08:00,815
since, what,
before you were born?

129
00:08:03,184 --> 00:08:04,885
Looks like we got
another Z-Bot brain here

130
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,120
from the very last war.

131
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,856
Found this up on level three.

132
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,791
And check this out.

133
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:13,160
Still got a makeshift
scramble drive jammed in there

134
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:14,929
to fry its brain.

135
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:16,864
Must be an inside joke.

136
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:20,001
Man, I have not seen
one of these in a long time.

137
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:21,769
Bag it, and tag it.

138
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,971
What's your name,
Councilor?

139
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:25,239
Oh.

140
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:27,041
Yeah, I joined the Council
a long time ago.

141
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:29,143
I'm a retired sergeant.

142
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:33,147
Electromagnetic pulse
specialist Agnes Oros.

143
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,882
- This is my son Trevor.
- Sir.

144
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:38,119
My daughter Reena.

145
00:08:38,152 --> 00:08:40,187
Nice to meet you.

146
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:42,690
I'm Colonel Evander Wilks.

147
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:43,858
You, too, huh?

148
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:46,093
Sergeant Mark Oros...

149
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:47,762
sir.

150
00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:48,829
Hey, Trev...

151
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,067
you know Reena doesn't
like using the tech, either.

152
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,735
Yeah, yeah, I know. I got it.

153
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:55,936
Safety over efficiency.

154
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,304
Okay, listen.

155
00:08:57,338 --> 00:08:59,206
When we're done here,
why don't you answer

156
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,575
the Council's
recruitment letter?

157
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:03,277
Join the Coding Defense Team.

158
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,614
You can code on your tablet
all day, every day.

159
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:08,816
Thanks, Mom.

160
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,219
You know, Lieutenant May

161
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:14,955
said the code I sent in
got a perfect score.

162
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:16,590
Yeah. I'm proud of you.

163
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:19,193
You know,
Reena's not the only one

164
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,294
who doesn't like using tech.

165
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:25,766
Beginning of the war,
people used to find

166
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,671
whatever nontech they could
that was undetectable.

167
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,008
They made metal clubs?

168
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:34,975
Yeah, they're called...

169
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,144
What are they called?

170
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:38,612
Baseball bat.

171
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:42,116
I didn't snag this
'cause I like antiques.

172
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:47,621
A lot of us vets don't like
using digital tech at all.

173
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,057
Whoa!

174
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:51,692
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

175
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:52,960
We need a medic.

176
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:56,730
Ah, no. Don't bother.

177
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:59,667
Reconstruction
Division's short on doctors.

178
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,303
They're still getting
everything staffed up.

179
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:04,638
This is just an old war wound.

180
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:05,973
- I'm in no hurry.
- Okay.

181
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:08,242
This thing goes up
at least four levels, anyway.

182
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,077
Come on.

183
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,981
Appreciate that.

184
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:16,650
You guys got
that light in your eyes.

185
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:18,953
Aboveground generation.

186
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:22,189
You don't get scared every time
something turns on around you.

187
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:24,191
You don't have to think
about all those tech myths

188
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:26,260
the parents of my generation
had to think about.

189
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,195
Like what?

190
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:31,031
Myths my grandparents
used to talk about.

191
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:33,267
Bots that could do anything.

192
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,402
Bots as big as this planet.

193
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:36,871
Bots like gods...

194
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:38,973
evil gods.

195
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,074
Like a T.C.

196
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:41,308
What's a T.C.?

197
00:10:41,342 --> 00:10:44,278
It's just another one
of those myths.

198
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,848
But a little fear
can be healthy, right?

199
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,751
Agnes, you look familiar.

200
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:53,020
Formerly Sergeant Agnes Gura.

201
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,890
Ah, yes, of course.

202
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:57,324
My condolences.

203
00:10:57,358 --> 00:10:59,093
I heard about David Gura.

204
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:01,896
I'm grateful for everything
you and he did during the war.

205
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:03,864
Saved thousands of us.

206
00:11:03,898 --> 00:11:05,366
Large-scale EMP bombs, huh?

207
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:08,435
- That's correct.
- Hmm.

208
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:10,471
Well, with all the things
we'll be working on together,

209
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:12,339
I guess it makes us
family now, huh?

210
00:11:12,373 --> 00:11:15,776
And we certainly have
our work cut out for us.

211
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:18,179
I know the Council
wants to preserve

212
00:11:18,212 --> 00:11:20,314
these old Z-Bots for research.

213
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:24,752
I want to destroy them.

214
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:28,122
The technology's
so old, anyway.

215
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,456
We can't repurpose them.

216
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,192
And half of this stuff
was useless

217
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:33,227
even when we
were hiding underground.

218
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:37,398
Rocket launchers
from the 2000s.

219
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:39,700
Hey.

220
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:42,269
Hey!

221
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:45,105
I let it slide this morning.

222
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:47,509
You know better.
No computerized tech.

223
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:50,110
Well, Mark, I seem to remember
a couple years ago,

224
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:52,112
when our actual dad
was still alive--

225
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:56,951
That almost
sounded like ordnance.

226
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:59,920
No, that <i>was</i> ordnance.

227
00:11:59,954 --> 00:12:02,489
I'm getting an alert
from the Council.

228
00:12:02,524 --> 00:12:05,059
It says the four generators
downtown by the headquarters,

229
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:06,026
they turned into robots.

230
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,531
What?

231
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:11,465
Yeah, robots!

232
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:13,834
Is it another Z attack?

233
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,069
It doesn't say.

234
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:16,837
- Power it down.
- What?

235
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,405
You know the rules.
If we're ever under attack...

236
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:20,774
- No more digital.
- Yeah, Mom. I got it. I know.

237
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:22,243
But I could use it
to hack what's attacking us.

238
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:24,478
Power it down, son.

239
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:27,549
This could be a lot worse
than you think it is.

240
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,929
That came
from inside the building!

241
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,464
Let me try and hack 'em.

242
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:45,966
There's no time. We have
to get to Council Headquarters.

243
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,468
Turn that tablet off now!

244
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:50,771
What the hell is that?!

245
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:02,149
Go!

246
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,250
Run! Get out!

247
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:06,053
Grab the weapons!

248
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,428
Hurry!
Get out of the building!

249
00:13:20,502 --> 00:13:21,435
There's no charge!

250
00:13:23,638 --> 00:13:25,873
You gotta hack it,
like we did in the war.

251
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:28,442
Be careful, or it'll
go up in a fireball.

252
00:13:43,558 --> 00:13:46,126
Mom, no!

253
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:49,196
We're completely sealed off!

254
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,034
What about Mom?!

255
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:55,369
We'll have to find
another way.

256
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,176
Where are we going?

257
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:04,411
These new bots
might be able to hear us.

258
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:05,879
They might even
have heat detection,

259
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:07,381
like the ones we fought
during the war.

260
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:08,949
Why isn't it leaving?

261
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:09,950
Maybe it's following us.

262
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,052
What?

263
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:13,087
Go. Go.

264
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:32,239
Reena, go.

265
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,243
Hurry! It's getting closer!

266
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:37,612
- Go! Go!
- Colonel.

267
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,549
Colonel, come on! Let's go!

268
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,550
Colonel!

269
00:14:42,584 --> 00:14:45,419
Colonel! Colonel, no!

270
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,226
Colonel!

271
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:53,227
Come on!

272
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:55,496
Come on!

273
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,103
Trevor, help.

274
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:04,104
My coat is stuck.

275
00:15:12,714 --> 00:15:14,248
Go. Go. Go.

276
00:15:19,554 --> 00:15:21,188
Down to the right here.

277
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,557
This way. This way. Go.

278
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:32,600
Hey, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

279
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:36,638
It's following us.

280
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:38,573
Go quietly. Go quietly.

281
00:15:39,774 --> 00:15:41,241
It's still following us.

282
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:43,110
The colonel said
it could have heat detection.

283
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,077
Trevor!

284
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:46,313
There!

285
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,649
The hot steam
should give us some cover!

286
00:15:47,682 --> 00:15:49,249
Go! Go!

287
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:53,688
Here's the situation.

288
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:02,196
Prime Minister, we have
transmorphed technology here,

289
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:03,765
here, and right here.

290
00:16:03,798 --> 00:16:05,232
Our Z-Bot alert systems

291
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:07,334
already gave me
a full report, General.

292
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,671
We're gonna put down
this attack quickly.

293
00:16:09,704 --> 00:16:12,306
Our strike force is already
getting 'em from the air.

294
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,308
Prime Minister, I think
it's gonna take more than that.

295
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:16,678
I mean, this isn't
Z-Bot technology.

296
00:16:16,711 --> 00:16:18,780
Our defense coding
and our tech teams

297
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:20,715
don't even know what this is.

298
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:22,617
They're taking the form
of robotic lions.

299
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,785
Lions?

300
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:26,186
Lions went extinct
over 100 years ago.

301
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,724
Well, I think maybe
they're mimicking our logo?

302
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:32,125
Or maybe it's something else.
We don't know.

303
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,427
But we do know this.

304
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,295
- They're not just in the city.
- Mm-hmm.

305
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,397
They're all around
the southwestern territory.

306
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:39,099
- Southwestern territory?
- Yes, sir.

307
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,435
That's thousands
of square miles.

308
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:44,539
You need to make this
make sense to me.

309
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:45,807
Last time I checked, we have

310
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,676
the only semistate data cloud
in the world.

311
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,278
I mean, a Z-Bot
trying to break in

312
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:52,580
would be like an infant

313
00:16:52,614 --> 00:16:55,482
trying to break into
a carbon-fiber prison.

314
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:56,483
Prime Minister--

315
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:57,785
This headquarters was designed

316
00:16:57,819 --> 00:17:01,054
specifically to run
a post-algorithmic signal

317
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:04,057
to shield our entire planet.

318
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:06,493
Sir, it's because
this is hybrid technology.

319
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:08,763
We don't know.

320
00:17:08,796 --> 00:17:11,799
The power plant's computer
has designated it an A.P.F.

321
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,100
A.P.F.?

322
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:16,403
It's an apex predator function.

323
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,205
We haven't been able
to get deep enough

324
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,508
into the programming to
understand its prime directive,

325
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:21,776
but whenever
one of these things

326
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:24,512
comes in contact
with a mechanical device,

327
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:26,848
turn into
a hunt-and-kill robot.

328
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:28,816
Yeah, this is way more advanced

329
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,552
than any Z-Bot
we fought in the war.

330
00:17:30,585 --> 00:17:32,854
This--This sort of A.P.F.,

331
00:17:32,887 --> 00:17:36,256
it operates under 4 terahertz.

332
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,259
Now, that's nanobot technology.

333
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:42,797
Tech guys have managed
to get a rendering

334
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,333
of this image after doing
an element profile.

335
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:47,769
- This object...
- Yeah.

336
00:17:47,802 --> 00:17:49,804
is nanotech scale?

337
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:50,805
Yes, sir.

338
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:55,375
Does this mean our
global server is vulnerable?

339
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,110
It's possible, sir.

340
00:17:57,144 --> 00:18:00,314
If Defense Coding can't
figure out what the program is,

341
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:01,883
we could have a breach
in the firewall.

342
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:06,253
As it is now, they tell me
our firewall is 100% secure.

343
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,322
Issue the Anthracite Protocol.

344
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:10,257
Nothing digital is safe.

345
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,159
Nothing with
computerized language.

346
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:15,195
Nothing with a processor.
Nothing.

347
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:16,831
And have the bunker retrofitted

348
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:20,500
with an analog radio,
analog data lines.

349
00:18:20,535 --> 00:18:24,371
But keep the server online
until I tell you differently.

350
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:26,173
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

351
00:18:33,948 --> 00:18:35,617
Trevor!

352
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,818
Reena!

353
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:40,487
I'm gonna try
calling them again.

354
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:42,155
Oh, no. If you keep calling,

355
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:43,658
it's just gonna
draw the bots to us.

356
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:45,727
Those bots are coming
for us either way.

357
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,828
I gotta try.

358
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:48,596
Trevor.

359
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,163
Reena. Come in.

360
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:54,535
Trevor, Reena, this is Mom!

361
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:56,169
Come in!

362
00:18:59,741 --> 00:19:01,241
It's no use.

363
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,544
I'm gonna call Brady
at Global Headquarters.

364
00:19:03,578 --> 00:19:04,879
Are you sure?

365
00:19:04,912 --> 00:19:06,748
I mean, he's probably
been evaced out of HQ

366
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:08,315
to a bunker in the desert.

367
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:10,818
He said if I ever
needed a favor, call him.

368
00:19:10,852 --> 00:19:12,486
This is that favor.

369
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:20,227
We'll need it to direct
the Global Military Divisions.

370
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,764
And have the bunker
have analog weapons,

371
00:19:22,797 --> 00:19:26,901
antiques, like those,
uh, automatic rifles,

372
00:19:26,934 --> 00:19:28,569
fully loaded.

373
00:19:28,603 --> 00:19:30,370
Prime Minister.

374
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:31,839
Sir, you're getting
a priority-one

375
00:19:31,873 --> 00:19:33,975
radio transmission
from the Van Ryberg Center.

376
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:35,409
Who's calling?

377
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:37,779
It's Sergeant Agnes Oros, sir.

378
00:19:37,812 --> 00:19:39,947
Agnes Oros?

379
00:19:39,981 --> 00:19:41,616
From the Liberation Day Battle.

380
00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:44,619
Oros specializes
in this kind of warfare.

381
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:46,788
She and David Gura
defeated the Z-Bots

382
00:19:46,821 --> 00:19:48,890
using electromagnetic bombs.

383
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:51,693
We'll evacuate at 1405
to Bunker Theta.

384
00:19:51,726 --> 00:19:53,360
Sir, that's
inside headquarters.

385
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:55,963
We have a 10-story bunker
in the eastern desert.

386
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:58,331
With this threat,
we aren't gonna do anything

387
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:01,502
that exposes us to danger
outside of these walls.

388
00:20:08,976 --> 00:20:10,611
We gotta be
getting closer.

389
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,514
Cut the city power grid.

390
00:20:13,548 --> 00:20:15,683
Get me regular updates
from Coding Defense

391
00:20:15,717 --> 00:20:17,384
on how to kill these things.

392
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:18,920
And have them read
over the radio.

393
00:20:18,953 --> 00:20:20,387
Nothing electronic.

394
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,623
Then I want you to call in
a major airstrike

395
00:20:22,657 --> 00:20:24,959
to L.A. City everywhere...

396
00:20:24,992 --> 00:20:26,861
once we know people
are back underground.

397
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,428
No nukes.

398
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:31,398
Uh, sir, are you suggesting

399
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:33,366
that we take the people
back underground?

400
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,869
We've just spent
the last 20 years

401
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:36,436
bringing them aboveground.

402
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,472
Yes, they're going
back underground.

403
00:20:38,506 --> 00:20:39,841
I know
everybody's gonna be mad

404
00:20:39,874 --> 00:20:41,976
'cause they got a taste
of life aboveground,

405
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:44,612
but you reassure them,
by the end of the day,

406
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:46,781
it's gonna be safe
to go back aboveground.

407
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:50,752
Also tell 'em this attack
will not be tolerated.

408
00:20:50,785 --> 00:20:51,719
Yes, sir.

409
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:54,321
Agnes.

410
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:55,455
Brady.

411
00:20:56,624 --> 00:20:58,425
I'm calling in that favor.

412
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,360
I figured as much.

413
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:02,764
I'm sending in
an immediate evac

414
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:04,832
and advance warships.

415
00:21:04,866 --> 00:21:07,334
That's not it. It's my kids.

416
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,336
My two kids, Reena and Trevor,

417
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:10,905
they're trapped inside
the Van Ryberg Center.

418
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:12,807
Prime Minister...

419
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,576
the other Council members
have demanded an airstrike,

420
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,310
Spear Fighter Craft.

421
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:18,846
That's a suicide mission.

422
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,313
An airstrike?

423
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:22,650
They could transmorph
the planes.

424
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:24,752
The attack
is already under way.

425
00:21:24,786 --> 00:21:28,723
The outposts insisted that we
stop these Z-Bots immediately.

426
00:21:29,991 --> 00:21:31,626
Agnes...

427
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:33,528
there's an airstrike
on the way there,

428
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:35,596
and the Van Ryberg Center...

429
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,931
is a hot spot.

430
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:40,034
David went back for you.

431
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:42,870
20 years ago, those Z-Bots

432
00:21:42,904 --> 00:21:45,338
launched an attack
on a chemical plant,

433
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:47,008
<i>and you couldn't get out.</i>

434
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,610
Now, it took years
to show effects, but if he...

435
00:21:51,078 --> 00:21:54,549
if he hadn't gone in,
he'd still be here.

436
00:21:54,582 --> 00:21:55,883
Hmm.

437
00:21:57,985 --> 00:21:59,554
If you're gonna launch
a massive attack

438
00:21:59,587 --> 00:22:02,056
on this compound,
we've got 65 minutes to prep.

439
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:04,559
Send in the elite rescue team,

440
00:22:04,592 --> 00:22:07,427
the primary S&R unit.

441
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,597
We're gonna need
all the help we can get.

442
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,833
If we fail to contain
this threat quickly,

443
00:22:11,866 --> 00:22:14,535
your expertise
in electromagnetic bombs

444
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:16,838
is gonna be crucial
to our defense.

445
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:19,006
I'll help you
with whatever you want

446
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,808
soon as I know
my kids are safe.

447
00:22:20,842 --> 00:22:21,976
I'll have you and your family

448
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:23,945
brought back here
after the rescue.

449
00:22:28,516 --> 00:22:29,584
Mark.

450
00:22:29,617 --> 00:22:30,818
I know.

451
00:22:32,086 --> 00:22:33,588
It's war again.

452
00:22:58,946 --> 00:23:00,147
Move it!

453
00:23:00,181 --> 00:23:01,115
Come on!

454
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:21,736
Heading around.

455
00:23:34,882 --> 00:23:36,217
Reload! Reload!

456
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,885
Someone cover me!
Someone cover me!

457
00:23:46,627 --> 00:23:48,062
Watch out!

458
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,958
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

459
00:24:16,991 --> 00:24:18,859
<i>All strike force pilots,</i>
<i>code Z.</i>

460
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:20,561
<i>Code Z. Report</i>
<i>to flight deck immediately.</i>

461
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:25,933
- Sir.
- At ease.

462
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:27,635
Have you been briefed yet?

463
00:24:27,668 --> 00:24:29,203
Right before I entered.

464
00:24:29,236 --> 00:24:31,138
Good. We need
to get this right, or--

465
00:24:31,172 --> 00:24:32,173
We will.

466
00:24:32,206 --> 00:24:33,140
Target?

467
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:36,811
The Van Ryberg Center?

468
00:24:36,844 --> 00:24:38,913
That place
isn't even built yet.

469
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:41,082
Like I said,
we need to get this right.

470
00:24:47,755 --> 00:24:49,090
What if this is only a drill?

471
00:24:49,123 --> 00:24:50,791
How many of these skirmishes
have we done

472
00:24:50,825 --> 00:24:52,793
in the past 10 months?
It's always a false alarm.

473
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:54,729
Not this time.
We have confirmed sightings

474
00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:56,030
in New Los Angeles City.

475
00:24:56,063 --> 00:24:58,299
Look, you're a good pilot,
Private Connor.

476
00:24:58,332 --> 00:24:59,834
Do you know why the Council

477
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:01,702
never rejects a recruit
to our flight team?

478
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:02,737
Sir, I'm sorry.

479
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,672
Because we lost
tens of thousands

480
00:25:04,705 --> 00:25:06,640
of men and women
on Liberation Day, and now

481
00:25:06,674 --> 00:25:09,110
we're constantly scrambling
to find enough pilots.

482
00:25:09,143 --> 00:25:10,878
Sir, I'm not trying
to make excuses.

483
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:13,047
Normally we have time
to run a preflight diagnostic.

484
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,648
You're right.

485
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:16,717
We need to know exactly
what we're dealing with.

486
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:21,088
And I have one of these
for backup.

487
00:25:21,122 --> 00:25:22,690
A scramble drive?

488
00:25:22,723 --> 00:25:24,125
Won't that wipe
the jet's operating system?

489
00:25:24,158 --> 00:25:26,127
It's an old trick
we used during the war.

490
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,929
Sir, it's been a long time
since the war.

491
00:25:28,963 --> 00:25:29,997
We've been
using tech constantly

492
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:31,799
since I've been here.

493
00:25:31,832 --> 00:25:34,168
Do you really think we'll need
to use something like that?

494
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:36,971
Trust me, it's better
to have it and not need it.

495
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:38,339
Copy that, sir.

496
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:42,243
Do you hear that?

497
00:25:42,276 --> 00:25:43,778
That's a warm-up.

498
00:25:43,811 --> 00:25:45,112
Pilots your age.

499
00:25:45,146 --> 00:25:47,081
They always seem to have
the same complaint.

500
00:25:47,114 --> 00:25:50,184
Too many drills.
Never seen a robot.

501
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:53,354
Well, that is why
we run so many drills.

502
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:56,657
We've been preparing you for
exactly what's happening today.

503
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,758
Let's go.

504
00:25:59,827 --> 00:26:03,697
Listen, all this,
everything aboveground,

505
00:26:03,731 --> 00:26:06,600
it was all smoke and rubble
during the war.

506
00:26:06,634 --> 00:26:08,102
The sky was black.

507
00:26:08,135 --> 00:26:10,838
It rained round the clock.

508
00:26:10,871 --> 00:26:12,706
Anyone aboveground

509
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,142
was almost instantly
killed by Z-Bots.

510
00:26:15,176 --> 00:26:17,378
I've never seen a Z-Bot
in real life.

511
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:19,080
Well, today's your lucky day.

512
00:26:19,113 --> 00:26:20,781
Although I'd like to think
we're better prepared

513
00:26:20,815 --> 00:26:23,184
to handle them now
than we were 20 years ago.

514
00:26:23,217 --> 00:26:24,718
Can they really
disguise themselves

515
00:26:24,752 --> 00:26:25,986
as any piece of tech?

516
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,255
Yes.

517
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:32,760
My squad leader told me
they were in the hell sector.

518
00:26:32,793 --> 00:26:36,397
My squad leader thought that he
could hack into an old tank,

519
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,065
not to turn it on,

520
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:40,801
but to try and steal
the pulse cannon on the front.

521
00:26:42,703 --> 00:26:45,172
I'm assuming it didn't go well.

522
00:26:45,206 --> 00:26:47,007
No, it did not.

523
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,977
We were trying to get
to a collapsed supply depot,

524
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,912
about 100 men and women.

525
00:26:51,946 --> 00:26:54,415
The ammunition charger
transmorphed first.

526
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:57,318
25 people were shredded
in seconds.

527
00:26:57,351 --> 00:27:00,988
Everyone surged forward
screaming.

528
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:02,723
The tank transmorphed next,

529
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:05,126
and all of a sudden,
the entire place lit up,

530
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:08,195
everyone shooting
in all directions.

531
00:27:08,229 --> 00:27:09,864
But it was too late.

532
00:27:09,897 --> 00:27:13,033
I woke up in a triage
with half my insides missing.

533
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:14,902
I'm sorry, sir.

534
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:20,374
Six generations fighting
a war from underground.

535
00:27:20,407 --> 00:27:23,677
You have no idea
how good you've had it.

536
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:25,713
I was 25 years old

537
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:28,382
when I saw the sun
for the first time.

538
00:27:28,415 --> 00:27:30,451
Sir, what about the jets?

539
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:31,452
Won't they transmorph?

540
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:33,354
Well...

541
00:27:33,387 --> 00:27:35,856
that's why we run
the pre-flight check.

542
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,259
We planned for that exactly.

543
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:42,830
And if all else fails,
we've got the scramble drive.

544
00:27:42,863 --> 00:27:43,831
Mm-hmm.

545
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:50,037
Look, the firewalls
we use on the jets,

546
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,072
the tech we've developed,

547
00:27:52,106 --> 00:27:53,274
it's all Z-Bot-proof.

548
00:27:53,307 --> 00:27:55,209
I tested it myself personally.

549
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:57,478
Then why do we need
the scramble drive?

550
00:27:57,512 --> 00:27:58,913
Stopping destructive code

551
00:27:58,946 --> 00:28:01,081
is a technique
we had to learn to survive.

552
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:08,889
Tech synced.

553
00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:11,225
Synced.

554
00:28:11,258 --> 00:28:13,060
Good. Let's move.

555
00:28:27,808 --> 00:28:30,911
Q-Bots spotted.
Prepare to engage.

556
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:34,248
Copy that, Captain. Weapons
armed and ready on your signal.

557
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:36,383
We need to get
directly over them first.

558
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:38,419
We can't afford
to miss any shots.

559
00:28:40,454 --> 00:28:42,323
Copy that, Captain.

560
00:28:42,356 --> 00:28:44,825
Q-Bots on the attack! Engage!

561
00:28:44,858 --> 00:28:46,460
Copy that, Captain!

562
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:47,962
We'll take care of them

563
00:28:47,995 --> 00:28:50,130
just like we took care
of the ones in the city.

564
00:28:58,072 --> 00:28:59,773
Can you still hear it?

565
00:29:06,947 --> 00:29:08,148
Come on, Reena. Let's go.

566
00:29:14,154 --> 00:29:16,023
It spotted us.

567
00:29:16,056 --> 00:29:17,825
Is it able to network
with the others,

568
00:29:17,858 --> 00:29:19,493
let them know where we are?
I don't know.

569
00:29:19,527 --> 00:29:21,428
But I don't want to find out.

570
00:29:21,462 --> 00:29:23,531
Let's go. There's a door
at the end of the tunnel.

571
00:29:23,565 --> 00:29:25,065
We can seal this one shut, too.

572
00:29:29,504 --> 00:29:31,472
"Apex predator function"?

573
00:29:31,506 --> 00:29:33,207
What kind of program's that?

574
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,948
- Run!
- Go down!

575
00:29:40,981 --> 00:29:42,816
Go down!
We need to find weapons!

576
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,519
We need to escape this place!

577
00:29:54,995 --> 00:29:56,130
Can you still hear it?

578
00:29:56,163 --> 00:29:57,532
It's still down here.

579
00:29:57,565 --> 00:30:00,000
It sounds like it might be
two or three levels above.

580
00:30:01,335 --> 00:30:03,037
Should we keep going down?

581
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,371
Mom is probably
up there right now

582
00:30:04,405 --> 00:30:06,240
with the rescue team
looking for us.

583
00:30:08,942 --> 00:30:10,377
Mom, this is Trevor. Come in.

584
00:30:12,413 --> 00:30:14,248
Mom, Mark,
this is Trevor and Reena.

585
00:30:14,281 --> 00:30:15,916
We're here inside the tunnels.
Come in.

586
00:30:17,117 --> 00:30:19,587
Mom, Mark,
it's Reena and Trevor.

587
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:21,455
- Come in.
- Nothing.

588
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:24,091
That attack destroyed
a huge section of the building.

589
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:27,127
And it's not like
these things just stopped

590
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:28,262
once we got inside.

591
00:30:28,295 --> 00:30:30,364
Mom and Mark could
be miles away now,

592
00:30:30,397 --> 00:30:32,333
just to stay safe
while the military fights them.

593
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:36,403
We could be down here
for a while.

594
00:30:36,437 --> 00:30:39,306
We don't know how far down
these tunnels go.

595
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,342
Or how sensitive
the bots' heat detection is.

596
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:43,611
I know. I know.

597
00:30:43,645 --> 00:30:45,580
Or if we're
gonna hit a dead end.

598
00:30:45,613 --> 00:30:48,115
Hey, hey. Hey. Hey.
Hey, what's wrong?

599
00:30:48,148 --> 00:30:49,383
Are you having a panic attack?

600
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:51,018
- Yeah.
- Hey, hey, it's okay. Come on.

601
00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:52,219
- Yeah.
- Hey, hey.

602
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:54,088
I can't--I can't think.

603
00:30:54,121 --> 00:30:55,089
- Shh. Breathe.
- Can't breathe.

604
00:30:55,122 --> 00:30:57,424
Breathe.

605
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:58,560
Breathe.

606
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,495
Do you remember this?

607
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:04,298
We used to do this
when you were a kid.

608
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:07,101
Yeah. Yeah, I remember.

609
00:31:08,503 --> 00:31:10,037
I'm sorry.
I know this isn't helping.

610
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,205
- Shh. Look at me.
- I'm sorry.

611
00:31:11,238 --> 00:31:12,206
Look at me.

612
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:13,575
It's okay.

613
00:31:13,608 --> 00:31:15,976
We're gonna be okay, all right?

614
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:17,378
- Okay. Okay.
- The human race

615
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:20,114
was down here for 300 years
and managed to make it.

616
00:31:20,147 --> 00:31:21,415
Right?

617
00:31:21,448 --> 00:31:24,184
Mom and Dad fought down here
their whole lives

618
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:25,352
and won the war.

619
00:31:26,654 --> 00:31:28,021
- Okay. Okay.
- It's okay.

620
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:29,691
It's okay.
And you know Mom's

621
00:31:29,724 --> 00:31:31,925
not gonna stop
until we're rescued.

622
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:33,595
And with
all the lions attacking,

623
00:31:33,628 --> 00:31:37,431
there's no way the military
isn't focusing on this place.

624
00:31:37,464 --> 00:31:40,535
All right? Plus Mom and Mark
work for the Council.

625
00:31:40,568 --> 00:31:42,604
All right? They've gotta be
trying to rescue people.

626
00:31:42,637 --> 00:31:45,239
Listen, I think our best bet

627
00:31:45,272 --> 00:31:48,543
is to get as many doorways,
hatches, and steam pipes

628
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:50,978
between us and that lion
as possible.

629
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:52,547
But what if we
hit a dead end?

630
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,314
What if there's
more tech down here

631
00:31:54,348 --> 00:31:56,483
that can turn itself on
and transmorph?

632
00:31:58,085 --> 00:32:00,020
Mom said they used
these tunnels during the war.

633
00:32:01,455 --> 00:32:03,056
All right? We'll find
some weapons we can use.

634
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,692
Weapons we can't use.

635
00:32:04,726 --> 00:32:08,328
Reena, we can't fight them
with a baseball bat.

636
00:32:08,362 --> 00:32:10,130
Yeah, but a baseball bat
can't turn itself into

637
00:32:10,164 --> 00:32:12,065
something that can hunt you
and rip you to pieces.

638
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:13,100
Damn it.

639
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:14,301
That lion just keeps coming.

640
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:15,637
We need to go. Let's go.

641
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,638
Let's go. Go! Go!

642
00:32:23,711 --> 00:32:25,179
Shit. It found us.

643
00:32:25,212 --> 00:32:26,614
Now what?

644
00:32:26,648 --> 00:32:28,982
Trevor, wait!
It's totally computerized!

645
00:32:29,016 --> 00:32:30,350
We need to shut the door!

646
00:32:30,384 --> 00:32:31,452
Let's go!

647
00:32:34,689 --> 00:32:37,224
Welcome to the command center,
Prime Minister.

648
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:39,493
We have
carbon-reinforced concrete

649
00:32:39,527 --> 00:32:42,429
to protect against
any mechanical lions coming in.

650
00:32:42,463 --> 00:32:43,598
Analog weaponry.

651
00:32:43,631 --> 00:32:45,165
Yes, it's not a laser rifle,

652
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:47,702
but at least
it can't be transmorphed.

653
00:32:47,735 --> 00:32:49,470
I want you to meet
our elite lieutenants,

654
00:32:49,504 --> 00:32:52,105
Lieutenant May,
Lieutenant Ryan.

655
00:32:53,474 --> 00:32:54,709
At ease.

656
00:32:54,742 --> 00:32:56,076
Do we know if there's nanobots

657
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:58,378
inside the wiring
in these devices?

658
00:32:58,412 --> 00:33:00,013
We're running
a resistance tracker

659
00:33:00,047 --> 00:33:01,381
along our circuits now, sir.

660
00:33:01,415 --> 00:33:03,183
And while our platoons
are out there defending us,

661
00:33:03,217 --> 00:33:04,752
have you found a way
to hack 'em?

662
00:33:04,786 --> 00:33:06,320
Negative, sir.

663
00:33:06,353 --> 00:33:07,655
Both Tech Team
and Coding Defense

664
00:33:07,689 --> 00:33:10,558
have sent a barrage
of covert hellfire code,

665
00:33:10,592 --> 00:33:12,359
but the Q-Bots
receiving the signals

666
00:33:12,392 --> 00:33:14,161
spit it right back at us.

667
00:33:14,194 --> 00:33:16,564
They fried one of the servers
on the side of the HQ.

668
00:33:16,598 --> 00:33:18,131
Q-Bot?

669
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:19,333
Yes, sir.

670
00:33:20,635 --> 00:33:22,035
Tech Team designated them

671
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:24,471
as Quadrupedal Robots,
or Q-Bots for short.

672
00:33:24,506 --> 00:33:26,406
These Q-Bots
attacking downtown,

673
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,475
they were transmorphed
because of nanobots

674
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,678
hidden inside of digital tech
throughout the city.

675
00:33:30,712 --> 00:33:32,479
What's our Tech Team doing?

676
00:33:32,514 --> 00:33:35,517
As of 1439, the Q-Bots
have killed all members

677
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,317
of the Tech Team
at the power plant

678
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:38,620
and destroyed
all their equipment.

679
00:33:38,653 --> 00:33:40,622
Can you give me
an ad hoc diagnosis?

680
00:33:40,655 --> 00:33:42,757
Prime Minister,
an ad hoc diagnosis

681
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,125
won't detect anything
in the metal in our circuits.

682
00:33:45,158 --> 00:33:47,160
Without the Tech Team
to run an element profile

683
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:49,062
directly, physically
on our circuits,

684
00:33:49,096 --> 00:33:51,398
we have no way of knowing
if there are nanobots

685
00:33:51,431 --> 00:33:53,300
lying dormant
in our headquarters.

686
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:57,404
So these Q-Bots
could be in this bunker.

687
00:33:57,437 --> 00:33:59,607
They could even be
in this room. Is that right?

688
00:34:01,441 --> 00:34:02,677
Jesus.

689
00:34:05,813 --> 00:34:07,147
The attacking Q-Bots are now

690
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,683
within two miles
of our location.

691
00:34:08,716 --> 00:34:11,151
Should I send out
a phalanx order, sir?

692
00:34:11,184 --> 00:34:13,220
Negative.
Troops are to maintain

693
00:34:13,253 --> 00:34:15,790
their search-and-destroy
formation, please.

694
00:34:15,823 --> 00:34:18,826
General, we have
a malevolent programming alarm

695
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,261
along wireless transmission
and network cables.

696
00:34:21,295 --> 00:34:22,564
They're bombarding
our system, sir.

697
00:34:24,298 --> 00:34:26,333
Firewall's at 98%.

698
00:34:26,366 --> 00:34:29,537
So the Q-Bots have made
progress against our firewall.

699
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:31,639
Sir...

700
00:34:31,673 --> 00:34:33,407
out of an abundance of caution,

701
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,511
I think we should power down
our global server immediately.

702
00:34:36,544 --> 00:34:38,780
That's a negative. We need
to keep the server active

703
00:34:38,813 --> 00:34:40,113
to the very last minute.

704
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:42,817
But, sir, we can't risk--

705
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,619
Stand down, Lieutenant.

706
00:34:44,652 --> 00:34:46,888
In case you've forgotten,
the Council's primary function

707
00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:49,122
isn't just
to protect the planet

708
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:52,225
from malevolent spyware.

709
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:55,563
It's also to coordinate
our Global Armies for defense.

710
00:34:55,597 --> 00:34:57,699
Prime Minister.

711
00:34:57,732 --> 00:35:00,735
I have new intel
from our manual diagnostics.

712
00:35:00,768 --> 00:35:03,337
These transmissions...

713
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,607
they have realigned
in a radial pattern

714
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,575
directed straight
at headquarters.

715
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:10,377
So the Q-Bots are directed
at headquarters?

716
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,847
Once it breached the cursory
layers of our firewall,

717
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,617
it was able to detect
the nature of our operations.

718
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,318
So they now know
how powerful our server is.

719
00:35:18,352 --> 00:35:20,521
- That's correct, General.
- Oh, my God.

720
00:35:20,555 --> 00:35:22,422
And it's utilizing
all of its hacking resources

721
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:23,858
to try and seize control of it.

722
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:25,793
And if it does?

723
00:35:25,827 --> 00:35:28,362
It could transmit
a signal around the world

724
00:35:28,395 --> 00:35:29,864
using our server.

725
00:35:30,932 --> 00:35:33,333
Firewall's at 97% now, sir.

726
00:35:33,367 --> 00:35:35,536
This isn't just
a random viral signal.

727
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,238
It shows a defined sequence
set to turn every piece of tech

728
00:35:38,271 --> 00:35:39,941
into a Q-Bot within 12 hours.

729
00:35:39,974 --> 00:35:42,309
Lieutenant Ryan, I need you
to go to the server room.

730
00:35:42,342 --> 00:35:45,212
Power down
each server manually.

731
00:35:45,245 --> 00:35:47,715
Take analog weapons,
and take backup support.

732
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:49,449
I need this fire put out now.

733
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:50,450
Yes, sir.

734
00:35:53,353 --> 00:35:54,589
Lieutenant May,

735
00:35:54,622 --> 00:35:57,625
I need you to run a program
at 4 terahertz.

736
00:35:57,659 --> 00:35:59,794
Scramble it through our system.
That should prevent them

737
00:35:59,827 --> 00:36:02,329
from reactivating
any of those Q-Bots.

738
00:36:02,362 --> 00:36:04,732
My guess is
they're trying to...

739
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:06,366
damage our defense system.

740
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,370
That search and rescue
at the Van Ryberg Center,

741
00:36:10,404 --> 00:36:12,874
it can't fail, okay?

742
00:36:12,907 --> 00:36:16,511
Because right now,
Agnes and her EMP expertise

743
00:36:16,544 --> 00:36:18,513
is the only arrow
in our quiver

744
00:36:18,546 --> 00:36:20,615
that can pierce their defense.

745
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,452
These Q-Bots are relentless.

746
00:36:25,485 --> 00:36:27,555
If we can't shake 'em,
Search and Rescue's

747
00:36:27,588 --> 00:36:29,489
gonna have a real hard time
clearing off the landing zone,

748
00:36:29,524 --> 00:36:31,258
and they're not gonna
be able to pick us up.

749
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:33,427
Well, they're
not gonna retreat.

750
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,629
You're right.

751
00:36:34,662 --> 00:36:36,564
But we have to find
Trevor and Reena.

752
00:36:36,597 --> 00:36:38,498
We're not leaving
without my kids.

753
00:36:38,533 --> 00:36:39,701
And after we find them,

754
00:36:39,734 --> 00:36:41,669
we have to find a way
out of this zone.

755
00:36:44,404 --> 00:36:45,272
I have an idea.

756
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,577
Open up the sensor
on the back of your rifle.

757
00:36:52,647 --> 00:36:55,415
I'm gonna make an EMP bomb.

758
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:58,285
What, you're gonna overload

759
00:36:58,318 --> 00:36:59,887
the generator on the rifle?

760
00:36:59,921 --> 00:37:01,789
I'm gonna create
a feedback loop.

761
00:37:01,823 --> 00:37:03,524
Unfortunately
it's gonna fry your rifle,

762
00:37:03,558 --> 00:37:06,961
but it's also
gonna send a pulse

763
00:37:06,994 --> 00:37:08,495
that'll fry every lion

764
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:11,566
within a 100-yard radius
on the ground.

765
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,868
It shouldn't interfere
with Search and Rescue,

766
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:16,537
and it should give us some time
to get to a landing zone.

767
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,439
After we find the kids.

768
00:37:19,473 --> 00:37:20,474
And then...

769
00:37:21,642 --> 00:37:23,578
we could find
Prime Minister Grady

770
00:37:23,611 --> 00:37:25,947
and make him
the EMP bomb he wants.

771
00:37:31,853 --> 00:37:33,955
Go! Run!

772
00:37:38,726 --> 00:37:40,061
What was that?!

773
00:37:40,094 --> 00:37:41,963
They fired
our electromagnetic pulse

774
00:37:41,996 --> 00:37:43,831
right back at us.

775
00:37:43,865 --> 00:37:47,001
Mark, an EMP
doesn't affect these things.

776
00:37:48,603 --> 00:37:49,771
Search and Rescue, come in.

777
00:37:49,804 --> 00:37:51,471
We need immediate evac.

778
00:37:54,776 --> 00:37:56,644
Search and Rescue, do you copy?

779
00:38:00,748 --> 00:38:02,449
If they disabled our weapons,

780
00:38:02,482 --> 00:38:04,952
they most likely disabled
Search and Rescue's, too.

781
00:38:10,357 --> 00:38:12,292
I hope Trevor and Reena
are okay.

782
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,361
Hey.

783
00:38:17,698 --> 00:38:19,567
Mark,
if anything happens to them...

784
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,535
I know.

785
00:38:21,602 --> 00:38:23,571
We will find them.

786
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,443
Okay.

787
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:31,512
Let's move.

788
00:38:36,951 --> 00:38:39,654
Captain Watts,
the weapons aren't releasing!

789
00:38:39,687 --> 00:38:42,023
Affirmative on my end as well!

790
00:38:42,056 --> 00:38:44,391
I'm engaging
the scramble drive.

791
00:38:44,424 --> 00:38:47,028
That will give all nearby jets
a five-second hard reboot

792
00:38:47,061 --> 00:38:49,797
and should get
those bots out of our jets.

793
00:39:01,509 --> 00:39:04,411
Agnes, the airstrike
is closing in.

794
00:39:04,444 --> 00:39:05,980
There'll be there
in less than four minutes.

795
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:07,014
You gotta hurry.

796
00:39:11,451 --> 00:39:13,521
The reboot didn't work!

797
00:39:13,554 --> 00:39:16,090
We have to warn
the Prime Minister.

798
00:39:17,992 --> 00:39:18,960
Get down!

799
00:39:22,964 --> 00:39:24,699
Twelve hours...

800
00:39:24,732 --> 00:39:26,133
until they seize

801
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:28,703
the most powerful
computer system on Earth.

802
00:39:30,605 --> 00:39:31,873
Hey, Mark...

803
00:39:31,906 --> 00:39:34,742
I'm not leaving
without Trevor and Reena.

804
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:39,446
I'd rather get ripped apart
before I leave them.

805
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:41,682
Then we find them,
and we get 'em out of here,

806
00:39:41,716 --> 00:39:43,050
or we both get ripped apart.

807
00:39:44,185 --> 00:39:47,121
I do not care
how long it takes.

808
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:51,424
I will fight this damn war
until all of us are safe.

809
00:39:53,861 --> 00:39:56,097
We need
some conventional weapons.

810
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:58,199
No circuits. No nothing.

811
00:39:58,232 --> 00:40:00,201
Those are ancient artifacts.

812
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:02,870
I mean, are they even
still gonna be functional?

813
00:40:02,904 --> 00:40:04,605
There has to be
something we can use.

814
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:05,907
We don't have any choice.

815
00:40:09,677 --> 00:40:10,711
Over there.

816
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:24,525
They don't have
a single computer chip in 'em.

817
00:40:24,558 --> 00:40:26,459
Might as well have
been made by cavemen.

818
00:40:26,493 --> 00:40:28,461
You know how to use
one of these?

819
00:40:28,495 --> 00:40:31,165
Load it. Safety off.

820
00:40:31,198 --> 00:40:33,067
Shoot.

821
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,569
That's the girl I married.

822
00:40:35,603 --> 00:40:37,772
Let's go get my kids.

823
00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:53,788
Do they think they moved
this part of the tunnel

824
00:40:53,821 --> 00:40:55,556
so it'd make it hard
for unwanted bots?

825
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:57,191
I assume so.

826
00:40:57,224 --> 00:40:59,026
But with all the tech
able to transmorph,

827
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,695
I doubt it'll do us much good.

828
00:41:01,762 --> 00:41:02,730
Wait a second.

829
00:41:02,763 --> 00:41:04,497
What is it?

830
00:41:04,532 --> 00:41:06,934
Wait. Is that
a hard-wire code junction?

831
00:41:06,968 --> 00:41:07,902
It is.

832
00:41:09,704 --> 00:41:11,772
If there's any more tech
down here that can kill us...

833
00:41:13,174 --> 00:41:14,909
if we can cross
the code patch...

834
00:41:16,077 --> 00:41:17,645
we can scramble
their directives.

835
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:19,513
Not with these Q-Bots, Trevor.

836
00:41:19,547 --> 00:41:21,782
The people at HQ
spent all day and night

837
00:41:21,816 --> 00:41:23,985
generating code to prevent tech
from transmorphing.

838
00:41:24,018 --> 00:41:26,087
No, I know, but there's
a ton of tech down here,

839
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,089
including from the war.

840
00:41:28,122 --> 00:41:29,957
The Z-Bots...

841
00:41:29,991 --> 00:41:32,226
if we come across one
and it activates,

842
00:41:32,259 --> 00:41:34,595
we're not gonna
be able to fight it.

843
00:41:34,628 --> 00:41:36,263
We'll need it
to see us as an ally,

844
00:41:36,297 --> 00:41:37,898
even if it's just for a minute.

845
00:41:37,932 --> 00:41:40,267
If it's a Z-Bot,
it'll have to be wired in.

846
00:41:40,301 --> 00:41:43,004
You've seen the work
that Mom did.

847
00:41:43,037 --> 00:41:44,772
When they shut those things
down, they put them

848
00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:46,674
in a containment unit
plugged in.

849
00:41:48,843 --> 00:41:50,011
If we find one...

850
00:41:51,078 --> 00:41:53,681
this ought to do it.

851
00:41:53,714 --> 00:41:56,050
Then the Z-Bots
won't see us as a threat.

852
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:57,018
All right?

853
00:41:58,252 --> 00:41:59,653
All right? Come on.

854
00:42:04,592 --> 00:42:05,559
Dead end.

855
00:42:05,593 --> 00:42:06,727
We have to go back.

856
00:42:06,761 --> 00:42:08,329
Go back? Reena, if we go back,

857
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:10,631
we're gonna run right
into 'em. No. We're trapped.

858
00:42:10,664 --> 00:42:13,067
No! This can't be it.

859
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,602
At least we can open

860
00:42:14,635 --> 00:42:16,270
one of those panels
down there and hide inside.

861
00:42:18,272 --> 00:42:20,041
It's better than nothing.

862
00:42:20,074 --> 00:42:21,842
Plus there might be
one more air shaft

863
00:42:21,876 --> 00:42:24,011
or something inside
so we can climb through.

864
00:42:24,045 --> 00:42:26,847
I don't see how we're
gonna get these open.

865
00:42:27,948 --> 00:42:28,983
I bet that'll do it, though.

866
00:42:29,016 --> 00:42:31,152
Have you lost your mind?!

867
00:42:31,185 --> 00:42:32,686
When is it gonna sink into you

868
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,355
that this technology
is dangerous?

869
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:36,157
Every time you've tried
to hack something,

870
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,358
we've almost died.

871
00:42:37,391 --> 00:42:38,959
Besides, it might
turn into a lion.

872
00:42:38,993 --> 00:42:40,861
You don't think I realize that?

873
00:42:40,895 --> 00:42:42,696
I mean, what other choice
do we have?

874
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,031
But--But you
don't think I know?

875
00:42:44,065 --> 00:42:45,800
Know what?

876
00:42:45,833 --> 00:42:48,702
Reena, the only reason that
we're still alive right now

877
00:42:48,736 --> 00:42:50,604
is because of you.

878
00:42:50,638 --> 00:42:52,106
If you wouldn't have
used the baseball bat

879
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:53,674
to collapse the ceiling,

880
00:42:53,707 --> 00:42:55,342
we wouldn't even be here
right now, all right?

881
00:42:55,376 --> 00:42:56,877
I wouldn't have had anything

882
00:42:56,911 --> 00:42:59,046
to stab into the lock
to get us into the tunnel,

883
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,347
and I wouldn't
have had anything

884
00:43:00,381 --> 00:43:02,116
to bash that pipe with.

885
00:43:02,149 --> 00:43:05,152
Trevor, look, using zero tech
is not a right or wrong choice.

886
00:43:05,186 --> 00:43:06,720
- I'm saying--
- I know what you're saying.

887
00:43:06,754 --> 00:43:08,389
Reena, I know what
you're saying. I get it now.

888
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:09,924
I do, but by the time

889
00:43:09,957 --> 00:43:11,892
we even make a dent
in one of these panels

890
00:43:11,926 --> 00:43:14,361
with this baseball bat,
the lion'll be here.

891
00:43:14,395 --> 00:43:17,298
Look, my way definitely
is not the right way...

892
00:43:17,331 --> 00:43:19,300
but it's the only way
right now.

893
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:22,903
You ready?

894
00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:29,877
- Whoa. Slow, slow, slow.
- Trevor, look out.

895
00:43:32,379 --> 00:43:35,349
- Slow.
- Slow doesn't matter.

896
00:43:35,382 --> 00:43:37,318
They can detect heat.

897
00:43:40,988 --> 00:43:43,691
It doesn't even look
like they're activated.

898
00:43:43,724 --> 00:43:45,025
But look at that section there.

899
00:43:49,864 --> 00:43:52,199
The Resistance must have sent
a power surge through them,

900
00:43:52,233 --> 00:43:53,701
shutting them down,

901
00:43:53,734 --> 00:43:55,136
and then ripped
the connection out

902
00:43:55,169 --> 00:43:57,004
so the Z-Bots couldn't
power themselves back up.

903
00:43:57,037 --> 00:43:59,106
But that lion
just keeps coming.

904
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,075
Okay, what if--

905
00:44:01,108 --> 00:44:03,110
I know this sounds
totally insane,

906
00:44:03,144 --> 00:44:05,312
but what if we
turn the Z-Bots back on?

907
00:44:05,346 --> 00:44:07,314
What? Reena, what are
you talking about?

908
00:44:07,348 --> 00:44:08,849
Did we not
just get done saying

909
00:44:08,883 --> 00:44:10,351
that activating tech
was dangerous?

910
00:44:10,384 --> 00:44:11,986
Yeah, but their
programming language

911
00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:13,921
is decades outdated, remember?

912
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:15,789
Even that colonel
said it was worthless.

913
00:44:15,823 --> 00:44:17,825
What if the lions
can't take them on?

914
00:44:17,858 --> 00:44:19,193
They might start
attacking the Z-Bots,

915
00:44:19,226 --> 00:44:21,195
and then the Z-Bots
will fire back.

916
00:44:21,228 --> 00:44:22,163
Right.

917
00:44:23,864 --> 00:44:25,299
Wh-Whoa!

918
00:44:27,168 --> 00:44:28,903
That touch screen was a robot.

919
00:44:31,906 --> 00:44:33,040
We gotta turn 'em on.

920
00:44:33,073 --> 00:44:35,176
Look, if this goes badly,

921
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:36,143
I'm sorry.

922
00:44:43,117 --> 00:44:44,084
There.

923
00:44:44,118 --> 00:44:45,052
Okay.

924
00:44:48,222 --> 00:44:49,356
Here goes nothing.

925
00:44:58,265 --> 00:45:01,202
Scanning area
for imminent threats.

926
00:45:04,939 --> 00:45:07,775
Just--Just stay still.

927
00:45:07,808 --> 00:45:10,778
Apex Predator attack: imminent.

928
00:45:10,811 --> 00:45:11,912
What is your objective?

929
00:45:11,946 --> 00:45:14,114
Apex Predator attack: imminent.

930
00:45:14,148 --> 00:45:17,017
Objective: world domination.

931
00:45:17,051 --> 00:45:20,921
Primary resistance:
eliminate A.P.F.

932
00:45:20,955 --> 00:45:22,790
It's giving us
its basic programming.

933
00:45:24,124 --> 00:45:27,529
Z-Bot, do you have
an Apex Predator function?

934
00:45:27,562 --> 00:45:30,764
Negative. Baseline: Z-Bot.

935
00:45:30,798 --> 00:45:33,200
Function:
artificial intelligence

936
00:45:33,234 --> 00:45:35,035
and military strategy.

937
00:45:35,069 --> 00:45:38,839
Targeted for elimination:
lion robot hybrid.

938
00:45:38,872 --> 00:45:41,942
Status: Quadrupedal robots
will attack

939
00:45:41,976 --> 00:45:43,444
Global Council Headquarters.

940
00:45:43,477 --> 00:45:46,413
It's giving us the Quadrupeds'
basic programming.

941
00:45:46,447 --> 00:45:48,215
The Z-Bots would scan humans

942
00:45:48,249 --> 00:45:50,417
to determine
their objective, strategies,

943
00:45:50,451 --> 00:45:52,119
and where they're heading next.

944
00:45:52,152 --> 00:45:55,222
It just told us where the lions
are planning their attack,

945
00:45:55,256 --> 00:45:58,892
so it must have scanned
the lions' neural network.

946
00:45:58,926 --> 00:46:00,861
Do you think the Z-Bots
are on our side?

947
00:46:02,096 --> 00:46:03,464
If they are on our side...

948
00:46:05,032 --> 00:46:06,400
if we have them on our side,

949
00:46:06,433 --> 00:46:08,802
then they can help us
destroy the remaining lions.

950
00:46:08,836 --> 00:46:10,971
Until they come for us.

951
00:46:11,005 --> 00:46:14,074
Sir, I got a priority message
from the soldiers in the field.

952
00:46:14,108 --> 00:46:16,277
They're almost completely
overrun by the Q-Bots.

953
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:18,580
They'll pulling every available
soldier they can find

954
00:46:18,613 --> 00:46:21,181
to protect the perimeter to
within two square blocks, sir.

955
00:46:21,215 --> 00:46:23,050
Lieutenant Ryan,
I need the status update.

956
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:24,519
Please tell me you
and the Tech Team

957
00:46:24,552 --> 00:46:26,320
have powered down
these servers.

958
00:46:26,353 --> 00:46:28,422
Sir, the Q-Bots' assault
on our firewall

959
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:30,424
managed to reroute
some of the flow of power

960
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:31,992
to other sections
of the system.

961
00:46:32,026 --> 00:46:33,994
It's tough to keep up
with their hack,

962
00:46:34,028 --> 00:46:35,262
but I'm working on it.

963
00:46:35,296 --> 00:46:38,299
As far as a total
tech takeover worldwide...

964
00:46:40,301 --> 00:46:42,136
we now have
seven hours remaining.

965
00:46:42,169 --> 00:46:44,438
Where's the rest
of the Tech Team, Lieutenant?

966
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:46,940
This is full
Anthracite Protocol.

967
00:46:46,974 --> 00:46:49,209
K.I.A., sir.

968
00:46:49,243 --> 00:46:52,146
Defending the HQ
at the outer perimeter.

969
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:53,347
Oh, God.

970
00:46:54,415 --> 00:46:56,283
Sir...

971
00:46:56,317 --> 00:46:58,852
I came across
a piece of alien code

972
00:46:58,886 --> 00:47:01,855
while deactivating some
of the systems on the server,

973
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:04,325
and I was able
to translate some of it.

974
00:47:04,358 --> 00:47:06,528
Seems the code
is directing these Q-Bots

975
00:47:06,561 --> 00:47:09,163
toward something
called Total Convergence,

976
00:47:09,196 --> 00:47:11,365
but I don't know
what they're converging

977
00:47:11,398 --> 00:47:13,033
or how to counteract it.

978
00:47:13,067 --> 00:47:15,603
They sure as hell aren't
using our server to do it.

979
00:47:15,637 --> 00:47:18,172
Do not let the Q-Bots
prevent us

980
00:47:18,205 --> 00:47:19,940
from shutting down
this server.

981
00:47:22,343 --> 00:47:25,446
All right, General,
how big a security detail

982
00:47:25,479 --> 00:47:28,882
can you put together to get us
up in the server room?

983
00:47:28,916 --> 00:47:30,585
All of our personnel
is in the field

984
00:47:30,618 --> 00:47:31,653
defending HQ.

985
00:47:31,686 --> 00:47:33,420
Well, then we're gonna go,

986
00:47:33,454 --> 00:47:36,023
and we all
are gonna shut it down.

987
00:47:36,056 --> 00:47:38,459
We also can't have 'em access
anything in this bunker.

988
00:47:38,492 --> 00:47:39,960
- Lieutenant May.
- Yes, sir.

989
00:47:39,993 --> 00:47:41,228
Continue monitoring this room.

990
00:47:41,261 --> 00:47:43,364
- Make sure nothing reactivates.
- Yes, sir.

991
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:47,167
This is the Resistance War
all over.

992
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:49,036
Private, grab a weapon.

993
00:47:49,069 --> 00:47:50,404
It's all hands on deck.

994
00:47:50,437 --> 00:47:51,372
Yes, sir.

995
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,348
Lieutenant!

996
00:48:01,382 --> 00:48:03,050
We're outside the door!

997
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:06,453
General, the nanobots
have taken over the technology!

998
00:48:06,487 --> 00:48:08,422
You can't use it!

999
00:48:08,455 --> 00:48:09,990
Gonna have
to open this manually.

1000
00:48:10,023 --> 00:48:12,092
- It's not gonna be easy.
- You're right.

1001
00:48:13,728 --> 00:48:15,929
Lana! A little help.

1002
00:48:15,963 --> 00:48:18,232
Lieutenant, we've taken out
the magnetic lock!

1003
00:48:18,265 --> 00:48:19,967
We need your help
from the inside!

1004
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,235
Copy that, sir!

1005
00:48:26,006 --> 00:48:26,974
This way.

1006
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,720
All right, Lieutenant,
I want all of this to go dark.

1007
00:48:38,753 --> 00:48:40,120
I don't want to hear

1008
00:48:40,154 --> 00:48:41,388
- so much as a cooling fan.
- Yes, sir.

1009
00:48:41,422 --> 00:48:43,090
Tell us what to do,
and we'll do it.

1010
00:48:43,123 --> 00:48:45,959
Well, first we need to go
over here to the secondary hub.

1011
00:48:45,993 --> 00:48:48,162
We have to work backward,
like fighting a fire.

1012
00:48:48,195 --> 00:48:49,597
Okay.

1013
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:52,299
Our meta-linguistic scans
are constantly regenerating,

1014
00:48:52,332 --> 00:48:55,469
but if we unplug
the secondary backup hub,

1015
00:48:55,502 --> 00:48:57,438
they've got nowhere to go.

1016
00:48:57,471 --> 00:49:00,307
Now, this cube
is a semistate conduit.

1017
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,644
If unplugged, it cuts off
all wireless signal

1018
00:49:02,677 --> 00:49:05,345
from around the world, going
into and out of the server.

1019
00:49:05,379 --> 00:49:09,283
If I take this cube, and I plug
it into the semistate port,

1020
00:49:09,316 --> 00:49:13,487
it'll redirect our entire
quantum A.I. sequence

1021
00:49:13,521 --> 00:49:15,088
onto this external drive.

1022
00:49:19,627 --> 00:49:20,562
What's happening?

1023
00:49:23,397 --> 00:49:24,566
Holy moley.

1024
00:49:27,669 --> 00:49:29,136
Get out now!

1025
00:49:29,169 --> 00:49:30,137
Lana, get behind me!

1026
00:49:38,045 --> 00:49:40,314
Everything is
completely destroyed.

1027
00:49:43,551 --> 00:49:45,052
If anyone can hear us,

1028
00:49:45,085 --> 00:49:46,621
this is Trevor and Reena Gura.

1029
00:49:46,654 --> 00:49:48,188
Main Council, come in.

1030
00:49:48,222 --> 00:49:50,057
I repeat--
Main Council, come in.

1031
00:49:53,528 --> 00:49:55,262
It sounds like
anybody that could help us

1032
00:49:55,295 --> 00:49:57,097
is either under attack
or dead by now.

1033
00:49:59,299 --> 00:50:02,169
Listen, we need to get
to the headquarters.

1034
00:50:02,202 --> 00:50:04,404
All right? If Mom and Mark
are gonna be anywhere,

1035
00:50:04,438 --> 00:50:05,540
it's gonna be there.

1036
00:50:05,573 --> 00:50:06,708
All right? Let's go.

1037
00:50:11,278 --> 00:50:12,547
Let's go. Let's go.

1038
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:17,050
There might be some weapons

1039
00:50:17,084 --> 00:50:18,553
inside that Council
patrol car we can use.

1040
00:50:18,586 --> 00:50:20,354
If there are,
we can't use them.

1041
00:50:20,387 --> 00:50:21,823
They run
on at least some tech.

1042
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:25,459
There's that alarm.

1043
00:50:25,492 --> 00:50:27,127
It's everywhere.

1044
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,229
It's gotta be a signal
coming from the Q-Bots.

1045
00:50:30,297 --> 00:50:31,599
If that's the case,

1046
00:50:31,633 --> 00:50:33,333
then right now,
we're totally surrounded.

1047
00:50:34,769 --> 00:50:36,504
We're at least a mile
from the headquarters.

1048
00:50:36,538 --> 00:50:39,306
If we call, they might be able
to send some troops to help us.

1049
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,042
- Is that a car?
- Let's go.

1050
00:50:48,415 --> 00:50:49,551
We'll have to be quiet.

1051
00:50:49,584 --> 00:50:51,218
I don't know this for sure,

1052
00:50:51,251 --> 00:50:54,087
but I'm guessing the lion-bots
have more than just--

1053
00:50:54,121 --> 00:50:56,089
Whoa. Whoa.

1054
00:50:56,123 --> 00:50:57,692
Go. Run! Run!

1055
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,776
- Up here! Up here!
- Go! Go! Go!

1056
00:51:16,443 --> 00:51:18,478
Get down. Get down. Get down.

1057
00:51:18,513 --> 00:51:19,514
Damn it!

1058
00:51:19,547 --> 00:51:21,181
I don't understand.

1059
00:51:21,214 --> 00:51:23,116
The Z-Bots scanned the neural
network of the Quadrupeds.

1060
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:24,484
They knew
where they were going.

1061
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:26,854
They should have seen
this attack coming, right?!

1062
00:51:26,888 --> 00:51:28,422
We've got to get ahold
of the Council!

1063
00:51:28,455 --> 00:51:30,424
Global Council,
this is Trevor Gura.

1064
00:51:30,457 --> 00:51:33,193
We need immediate rescue
outside the headquarters.

1065
00:51:33,226 --> 00:51:34,762
I think the radio is dead.

1066
00:51:36,564 --> 00:51:39,534
These things run
on old-world batteries.

1067
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:41,603
- We're pinned down.
- Z-Bot!

1068
00:51:41,636 --> 00:51:43,538
Record my voice,
and transmit the message

1069
00:51:43,571 --> 00:51:45,506
to all audio speakers in range!

1070
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:48,509
But that will--that will
draw the Q-Bots' attention.

1071
00:51:48,543 --> 00:51:50,645
At this point, we've already
got their attention.

1072
00:51:52,312 --> 00:51:54,414
Mom, Mark, Global Council,

1073
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:56,517
this is Trevor and Reena Gura!

1074
00:51:56,551 --> 00:51:57,785
We're heading in
to the headquarters

1075
00:51:57,819 --> 00:51:59,386
with friendly Z-Bots.

1076
00:51:59,419 --> 00:52:00,788
Do not open fire on us!

1077
00:52:00,822 --> 00:52:03,190
I repeat--
do not fire on us!

1078
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:07,327
Z-Bot, transmit audio.

1079
00:52:08,462 --> 00:52:10,632
<i>Mom, Mark, Global Council,</i>

1080
00:52:10,665 --> 00:52:12,700
<i>this is Trevor and Reena Gura!</i>

1081
00:52:12,734 --> 00:52:13,801
<i>We're heading in</i>
<i>to the headquarters</i>

1082
00:52:13,835 --> 00:52:15,536
<i>with friendly Z-Bots.</i>

1083
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:16,904
<i>Do not open fire on us!</i>

1084
00:52:16,938 --> 00:52:19,373
<i>I repeat--</i>
<i>do not fire on us!</i>

1085
00:52:20,942 --> 00:52:22,242
You ready?

1086
00:52:33,755 --> 00:52:35,556
Thank God.

1087
00:52:36,624 --> 00:52:37,759
They're alive.

1088
00:52:39,326 --> 00:52:41,461
They're alive,
but they're not safe.

1089
00:52:41,495 --> 00:52:44,666
There's no such thing
as a Z-Bot allied with a human.

1090
00:52:44,699 --> 00:52:47,669
Then we will go in,
and we will separate them

1091
00:52:47,702 --> 00:52:50,505
from whatever
Z-Bot platoon there is.

1092
00:52:50,538 --> 00:52:52,840
How did Trevor get a message
through the loudspeaker system?

1093
00:52:54,575 --> 00:52:57,679
Couldn't this just
be a trap set up by the Z-bots?

1094
00:52:57,712 --> 00:52:59,847
Or even the Q-Bots?

1095
00:52:59,881 --> 00:53:03,250
I mean, there's--there's no way
he hacked a Z-Bot, right?

1096
00:53:05,953 --> 00:53:07,187
I don't know.

1097
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:12,727
During the war,
the Z-Bots could record

1098
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,494
and transmit messages,

1099
00:53:14,529 --> 00:53:18,398
but they were recordings,
not simulations.

1100
00:53:18,432 --> 00:53:20,001
And the Council
recruited Trevor

1101
00:53:20,034 --> 00:53:22,335
for the Coding Defense team
for a reason.

1102
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:24,972
I think he used
that bot to communicate.

1103
00:53:25,006 --> 00:53:28,408
Even if the Z-Bots
would work with the humans

1104
00:53:28,442 --> 00:53:30,343
- against the Q-Bots--
- It's just a matter of time

1105
00:53:30,377 --> 00:53:32,580
before the Q-Bots
use their pulse

1106
00:53:32,613 --> 00:53:35,382
to seize the Z-Bots.

1107
00:53:35,415 --> 00:53:37,484
And we have no way
of stopping them.

1108
00:53:37,518 --> 00:53:38,586
Not even an EMP?

1109
00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:39,954
You saw what the Q-Bots did

1110
00:53:39,987 --> 00:53:41,789
when we detonated our rifles.

1111
00:53:41,823 --> 00:53:44,424
They bounced our EMP
right back at us.

1112
00:53:45,927 --> 00:53:47,494
I gotta warn the Council.

1113
00:53:50,031 --> 00:53:52,867
Sergeant Oros
to Global Headquarters.

1114
00:53:54,602 --> 00:53:57,572
This is Sergeant Oros
to Global Headquarters,

1115
00:53:57,605 --> 00:53:59,574
Priority Theta.

1116
00:53:59,607 --> 00:54:02,275
Trevor, Reena, come in.

1117
00:54:06,346 --> 00:54:07,314
We gotta get there.

1118
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:13,821
And if the Z-Bots gain access
and they're seized,

1119
00:54:13,855 --> 00:54:16,356
they could turn on us.

1120
00:54:16,389 --> 00:54:17,357
Let's go.

1121
00:54:21,361 --> 00:54:22,496
Get down.

1122
00:54:23,965 --> 00:54:25,633
Those things are everywhere.

1123
00:54:25,666 --> 00:54:26,968
They're airborne.
They're roaming the buildings.

1124
00:54:27,001 --> 00:54:28,970
Okay, go. Get to
something that's burning.

1125
00:54:32,807 --> 00:54:34,909
We are surrounded
above and below.

1126
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:35,877
Everywhere.

1127
00:54:36,978 --> 00:54:39,312
Okay, we keep moving.

1128
00:54:39,346 --> 00:54:41,616
If we just stick
to things that are burning,

1129
00:54:41,649 --> 00:54:43,017
I think we'll make progress.

1130
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,585
We're only a few blocks out,

1131
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:47,454
but that next section
of street, it's buckled,

1132
00:54:47,487 --> 00:54:51,358
and not to mention
the wreckage around it.

1133
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,693
A few more blocks.

1134
00:54:52,727 --> 00:54:53,661
Come on.

1135
00:54:55,096 --> 00:54:56,631
The firewalls in headquarters,

1136
00:54:56,664 --> 00:54:58,431
they can't have much left.

1137
00:54:58,465 --> 00:55:01,536
Even at 90%,
we can't produce an EMP

1138
00:55:01,569 --> 00:55:02,837
that's gonna do us any good.

1139
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:04,539
How about a nuclear option?

1140
00:55:04,572 --> 00:55:06,774
No. We'd wipe out
all the humans

1141
00:55:06,808 --> 00:55:08,441
along with the Q-Bots.

1142
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:10,812
We gotta find another way.

1143
00:55:22,023 --> 00:55:23,791
We're almost to HQ.

1144
00:55:23,825 --> 00:55:26,694
But that is
way too much open space

1145
00:55:26,727 --> 00:55:28,095
between us
and the main entrance.

1146
00:55:28,129 --> 00:55:30,131
Yeah, it's over 100 yards.

1147
00:55:30,164 --> 00:55:31,966
And we don't know

1148
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:34,101
how many lions
are circling the building...

1149
00:55:34,135 --> 00:55:35,837
even around the next corner.

1150
00:55:37,004 --> 00:55:39,372
If we make a run for the HQ,

1151
00:55:39,406 --> 00:55:41,909
I think their heat detection'll
spot us immediately.

1152
00:55:44,512 --> 00:55:46,581
But if we can make
a big enough fire,

1153
00:55:46,614 --> 00:55:47,982
I think it'll obscure it.

1154
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:50,518
At least they won't be able
to get a lock on us.

1155
00:55:50,551 --> 00:55:54,454
Yeah. The smoke might obscure
their visual sensors as well.

1156
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,390
You know,
there's probably a tool kit

1157
00:55:57,424 --> 00:55:59,093
inside the cab
of one of those transports.

1158
00:55:59,126 --> 00:56:01,896
I can puncture
an auxiliary fuel line,

1159
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:03,664
start an electric spark.

1160
00:56:03,698 --> 00:56:05,967
Whole thing'd go up
like a fireball.

1161
00:56:07,568 --> 00:56:08,736
Let's do it.

1162
00:56:25,553 --> 00:56:26,687
Torque dowel and hammer.

1163
00:56:26,721 --> 00:56:28,488
Okay, that's all we need.

1164
00:56:29,724 --> 00:56:30,691
I'm gonna keep watch.

1165
00:56:30,725 --> 00:56:32,727
Just try to get it in one go

1166
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,495
so we don't draw
any lions to us.

1167
00:56:38,165 --> 00:56:39,800
One more ought to do it.

1168
00:56:49,944 --> 00:56:51,078
Let's light it up.

1169
00:56:54,815 --> 00:56:56,784
Keep going! Don't stop!

1170
00:57:02,757 --> 00:57:03,791
Locked!

1171
00:57:03,824 --> 00:57:04,959
That one.

1172
00:57:06,527 --> 00:57:07,995
Down! Get down!

1173
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:10,463
Come on. Come on.

1174
00:57:14,535 --> 00:57:16,737
Oh, all the digital locks
are decommissioned.

1175
00:57:16,771 --> 00:57:18,139
The soldiers inside
must have done that.

1176
00:57:18,172 --> 00:57:19,607
Oh, damn it.

1177
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,008
We're too exposed out here.

1178
00:57:21,042 --> 00:57:22,209
You think they detected us?

1179
00:57:22,243 --> 00:57:24,612
If they haven't,
they will soon.

1180
00:57:24,645 --> 00:57:26,213
They're starting to swarm.

1181
00:57:28,816 --> 00:57:31,218
What is that?
Where'd you get that?

1182
00:57:31,252 --> 00:57:32,987
It's a pin
from the safety latch

1183
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:33,988
of the rocket launcher.

1184
00:57:34,021 --> 00:57:35,089
You're gonna pick the lock?

1185
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:38,693
We've been fighting
the Resistance all our lives,

1186
00:57:38,726 --> 00:57:41,696
and I have never seen you
go all 21st century before.

1187
00:57:41,729 --> 00:57:43,998
Ah. Old soldier taught me this.

1188
00:57:44,031 --> 00:57:45,866
Told him I never
wanted to get trapped

1189
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,035
behind an old-world door.

1190
00:57:50,838 --> 00:57:51,772
Inside!

1191
00:58:23,571 --> 00:58:25,539
We brought Trevor and Reena
here enough.

1192
00:58:25,573 --> 00:58:28,809
They should be smart enough
to know to go to HQ's bunker.

1193
00:58:47,228 --> 00:58:48,662
We can't go
outside the building

1194
00:58:48,696 --> 00:58:49,997
into the open again.

1195
00:58:50,031 --> 00:58:51,632
Wait.

1196
00:58:51,665 --> 00:58:55,669
The air in this hallway,
it's--it's stale.

1197
00:58:57,805 --> 00:59:00,808
The entire air circulation
system's been shut down.

1198
00:59:02,777 --> 00:59:04,045
Computerized.

1199
00:59:04,078 --> 00:59:05,546
Of course.

1200
00:59:08,949 --> 00:59:10,885
The sensors inside that system,

1201
00:59:10,918 --> 00:59:12,586
they can't transmorph anymore.

1202
00:59:13,954 --> 00:59:15,890
It'll buy us some time inside.

1203
00:59:17,058 --> 00:59:18,192
Here.

1204
00:59:18,225 --> 00:59:19,760
I'll give you a leg up.

1205
00:59:33,274 --> 00:59:36,577
We're on level D, midlevel.

1206
00:59:37,878 --> 00:59:39,213
Almost to the bunker, then.

1207
00:59:48,222 --> 00:59:49,890
Agnes.

1208
00:59:49,924 --> 00:59:51,859
My kids, are they here?

1209
00:59:51,892 --> 00:59:54,895
I haven't had word
from anybody about anything.

1210
00:59:54,929 --> 00:59:56,097
I'm sorry.

1211
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:58,732
Trevor, Reena, come in!

1212
00:59:58,766 --> 01:00:01,268
I'm sorry we couldn't do more
to find your family.

1213
01:00:03,737 --> 01:00:05,840
No, they said those Z-Bots
we're actively guarding them.

1214
01:00:05,873 --> 01:00:07,408
We don't know for sure
that's changed.

1215
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:09,243
They're not safe, Mark.

1216
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:11,946
I'm gonna
go out in the HQ

1217
01:00:11,979 --> 01:00:14,715
floor by floor
until I find them.

1218
01:00:14,748 --> 01:00:17,284
That--That should be physically
impossible, though, right?

1219
01:00:17,318 --> 01:00:20,421
The server
just turned into a Q-Bot.

1220
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:23,691
It's acquiring every piece
of technology it can

1221
01:00:23,724 --> 01:00:25,626
and turning it into a Q-Bot.

1222
01:00:30,131 --> 01:00:32,299
What is this new Q-Bot?

1223
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:33,701
I don't know.

1224
01:00:33,734 --> 01:00:36,036
I was too busy firing
to see it.

1225
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:38,038
But it's bigger
than anything else,

1226
01:00:38,072 --> 01:00:39,373
and it keeps growing.

1227
01:00:39,406 --> 01:00:41,876
It's acquiring
everything it can.

1228
01:00:44,445 --> 01:00:46,914
General Palmer, sir,

1229
01:00:46,947 --> 01:00:48,349
we need an extradition force

1230
01:00:48,382 --> 01:00:50,784
to get you and
the prime minister out of here.

1231
01:00:50,818 --> 01:00:54,188
All of our
extradition forces are dead.

1232
01:00:54,221 --> 01:00:56,257
The Q-Bots are taking over.

1233
01:00:56,290 --> 01:01:00,694
We have one last chance
to make a stand.

1234
01:01:00,728 --> 01:01:02,263
Take it easy, General.

1235
01:01:02,296 --> 01:01:06,233
Our sole objective is
to destroy the new Q-Bot

1236
01:01:06,267 --> 01:01:08,169
by any means necessary.

1237
01:01:08,202 --> 01:01:10,738
We're gonna need
an EMP blast

1238
01:01:10,771 --> 01:01:12,740
orders of magnitude greater

1239
01:01:12,773 --> 01:01:15,309
than anything
you've ever wired up before.

1240
01:01:20,214 --> 01:01:22,283
But you're gonna have
to do it without me.

1241
01:01:24,919 --> 01:01:25,853
I'm sorry.

1242
01:01:30,457 --> 01:01:32,193
Prime Minister.

1243
01:01:32,226 --> 01:01:33,327
Prime Minister.

1244
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:41,502
General.

1245
01:01:41,536 --> 01:01:44,471
Come--

1246
01:01:44,506 --> 01:01:45,873
There are new variables

1247
01:01:45,906 --> 01:01:47,942
that are a grave threat
to the mission.

1248
01:01:47,975 --> 01:01:49,410
When we were fighting
the Q-Bots,

1249
01:01:49,443 --> 01:01:53,247
Agnes trigged an improvised EMP
to fry their circuits,

1250
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,383
but the Q-Bots bounced
the signal right back at us

1251
01:01:56,417 --> 01:01:59,521
and kept fighting
like it was nothing.

1252
01:01:59,554 --> 01:02:01,288
- Oh, God.
- An EMP is not going

1253
01:02:01,322 --> 01:02:04,158
to stop these lions,
not even on a large scale.

1254
01:02:04,191 --> 01:02:05,859
General. Sergeant.

1255
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:08,929
I was able to decipher
some of the viral nanobot code.

1256
01:02:08,963 --> 01:02:10,898
I know
what Total Convergence is.

1257
01:02:10,931 --> 01:02:12,866
This new Q-Bot
isn't just going

1258
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,368
to transmorph
every piece of tech.

1259
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:18,239
It wants to connect itself
physically, not just digitally,

1260
01:02:18,272 --> 01:02:20,474
to every piece
of machinery everywhere

1261
01:02:20,508 --> 01:02:22,409
to form
a new weaponized organism.

1262
01:02:22,443 --> 01:02:24,311
That's why they wanted
control of our server,

1263
01:02:24,345 --> 01:02:26,213
to transmit its signal
around the world,

1264
01:02:26,247 --> 01:02:29,517
not only turning every piece
of tech into a weaponized bot,

1265
01:02:29,551 --> 01:02:32,419
but to lay the groundwork
for this new entity.

1266
01:02:32,453 --> 01:02:35,222
What? And our server
is so powerful

1267
01:02:35,256 --> 01:02:36,991
that this Q-Bot can, what,

1268
01:02:37,024 --> 01:02:39,994
break lesser firewalls
on other continents?

1269
01:02:40,027 --> 01:02:41,161
That's correct.

1270
01:02:41,195 --> 01:02:43,063
This new organism
will be all-seeing,

1271
01:02:43,097 --> 01:02:45,099
all-sensing, omnipresent,

1272
01:02:45,132 --> 01:02:47,134
easily able to kill
every living thing on Earth.

1273
01:02:47,167 --> 01:02:50,104
It'll almost be godlike.

1274
01:02:50,137 --> 01:02:51,272
Oh, my God.

1275
01:02:51,305 --> 01:02:53,774
That is Total Convergence.

1276
01:02:56,143 --> 01:02:57,311
Almost like a...

1277
01:02:59,146 --> 01:03:00,447
like a T.C.

1278
01:03:01,949 --> 01:03:04,818
A Total Convergence Robot.

1279
01:03:04,852 --> 01:03:07,522
It won't need to manufacture
circuits or chips.

1280
01:03:07,555 --> 01:03:09,557
It'd just combine everything
into one entity.

1281
01:03:11,392 --> 01:03:12,926
Wait.

1282
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,194
Wait, you said that the signal

1283
01:03:14,228 --> 01:03:16,497
is being transmitted
virally by nanobots?

1284
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:17,831
Correct.

1285
01:03:18,932 --> 01:03:20,602
Wait a minute. That--

1286
01:03:20,635 --> 01:03:23,538
The wiring for that circuit
is across from the armory.

1287
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:27,074
It's directly
across from the armory.

1288
01:03:28,475 --> 01:03:32,079
There's a locker
down the hall on the right.

1289
01:03:32,112 --> 01:03:33,615
Take that key.

1290
01:03:33,648 --> 01:03:36,183
It has all antique weaponry.

1291
01:03:36,216 --> 01:03:37,519
It's all analog weaponry.

1292
01:03:37,552 --> 01:03:39,621
There's no wires, no nothing.

1293
01:03:39,654 --> 01:03:41,121
General.

1294
01:03:41,155 --> 01:03:42,289
Jesus!

1295
01:03:43,424 --> 01:03:45,225
General.

1296
01:03:45,259 --> 01:03:46,427
- Oh, God.
- Ohh.

1297
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:48,162
It's worse than it looks,
trust me.

1298
01:03:49,396 --> 01:03:51,332
Come on. Come on.

1299
01:03:56,303 --> 01:03:57,905
Gentlemen,
I'm not gonna make it.

1300
01:03:59,206 --> 01:04:00,341
Come on, General.

1301
01:04:13,354 --> 01:04:15,590
He was my commanding officer
when I first joined.

1302
01:04:18,425 --> 01:04:20,027
Let's go flip that circuit.

1303
01:04:21,428 --> 01:04:23,197
Low and slow.

1304
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:24,398
Eyes sharp.

1305
01:04:24,431 --> 01:04:25,432
Come on.

1306
01:04:51,058 --> 01:04:53,093
<i>Agnes,</i>

1307
01:04:53,127 --> 01:04:55,129
<i>the signal isn't</i>
<i>being passed by the Q-Bots.</i>

1308
01:04:55,162 --> 01:04:58,365
<i>It's being passed by</i>
<i>the nanobots inside of them!</i>

1309
01:04:58,399 --> 01:05:00,200
So that's why the Q-Bots
can keep fighting

1310
01:05:00,234 --> 01:05:01,435
as if nothing happened.

1311
01:05:02,704 --> 01:05:04,271
And it's why they can fire

1312
01:05:04,304 --> 01:05:07,040
our electromagnetic pulses
back at us.

1313
01:05:07,074 --> 01:05:10,645
<i>That should be</i>
<i>physically impossible, right?</i>

1314
01:05:10,678 --> 01:05:13,180
Not on an atomic scale,
it's not.

1315
01:05:13,213 --> 01:05:15,550
The wavelength frequency
of an EMP

1316
01:05:15,583 --> 01:05:18,218
is between 100 megahertz
and 100 gigahertz.

1317
01:05:19,987 --> 01:05:21,955
It's wider
than the nanoscopic scale.

1318
01:05:34,736 --> 01:05:35,670
Get down!

1319
01:05:49,416 --> 01:05:51,351
These analog
Z-Bot-era laser cannons

1320
01:05:51,385 --> 01:05:53,487
and some handheld grenades
are a good start.

1321
01:05:57,559 --> 01:05:59,694
Those are power banks
just above us,

1322
01:05:59,727 --> 01:06:01,729
probably transmorphing
as we speak.

1323
01:06:01,763 --> 01:06:04,264
I mean, isn't that where
Agnes said she was going?

1324
01:06:04,298 --> 01:06:06,300
She said she's
going floor by floor.

1325
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:08,135
I gotta go back her up.

1326
01:06:08,168 --> 01:06:09,503
Go. I'll stay here.

1327
01:06:09,537 --> 01:06:11,171
We're not done just yet.

1328
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:38,398
Mark, they need you down there.

1329
01:06:38,432 --> 01:06:41,168
No. Ryan's keeping watch,
all right?

1330
01:06:41,201 --> 01:06:43,303
We heard transmorphing
machinery above us

1331
01:06:43,337 --> 01:06:44,338
right in this area.

1332
01:06:45,573 --> 01:06:48,175
I couldn't let you
face it alone.

1333
01:06:48,208 --> 01:06:50,344
I've haven't seen anything yet.

1334
01:06:50,377 --> 01:06:53,280
There are power banks
feeding the server rooms.

1335
01:06:53,313 --> 01:06:55,282
They need technicians
to maintain them,

1336
01:06:55,315 --> 01:06:59,654
so they should be
easy to find and destroy.

1337
01:07:01,388 --> 01:07:02,322
Wait.

1338
01:07:06,794 --> 01:07:09,531
Unless they've recessed
back into the walls.

1339
01:07:17,772 --> 01:07:18,740
We doing this?!

1340
01:07:18,773 --> 01:07:20,173
Yes, we are.

1341
01:07:28,415 --> 01:07:30,852
Okay, well, we did
nice demo on the wall.

1342
01:07:30,885 --> 01:07:32,319
You okay?

1343
01:07:32,352 --> 01:07:33,453
Still here.

1344
01:07:42,396 --> 01:07:44,666
We finally made it inside.

1345
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:46,300
Finally.

1346
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:48,268
We can thank the Z-Bots
for destroying those Q-Bots,

1347
01:07:48,302 --> 01:07:50,505
or we would have
never made it in.

1348
01:07:50,538 --> 01:07:52,640
I don't know how much safer
we are in here.

1349
01:07:54,542 --> 01:07:56,410
At least there's some
more places we can hide in.

1350
01:07:56,443 --> 01:07:58,245
Hopefully some weapons
we can use, all right?

1351
01:07:58,278 --> 01:07:59,379
Let's go. Let's go.

1352
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:01,181
- Wait.
- What?

1353
01:08:01,214 --> 01:08:02,517
When is the last time
you've seen

1354
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:04,117
someone print
this much material...

1355
01:08:04,151 --> 01:08:06,119
on paper?

1356
01:08:07,589 --> 01:08:09,456
If they were
relaying info analog.

1357
01:08:09,489 --> 01:08:11,626
Has to be related
to the attack, right?

1358
01:08:11,659 --> 01:08:14,127
It's just pages
and pages of code.

1359
01:08:16,531 --> 01:08:18,533
This is my code.
This is my code.

1360
01:08:20,835 --> 01:08:22,570
The data report shows
they tried to use it

1361
01:08:22,604 --> 01:08:23,805
to send a distress signal

1362
01:08:23,838 --> 01:08:25,238
to the other territories
around the world,

1363
01:08:25,272 --> 01:08:27,775
but they were
overrun by Q-Bots.

1364
01:08:27,809 --> 01:08:29,577
They were overrun?

1365
01:08:29,611 --> 01:08:31,345
Everywhere?

1366
01:08:31,378 --> 01:08:33,213
They must have been
real desperate

1367
01:08:33,246 --> 01:08:35,750
if they tried to fire up
a tech hub one last time.

1368
01:08:35,783 --> 01:08:36,718
Damn.

1369
01:08:38,786 --> 01:08:41,522
Look, this is a scramble drive.

1370
01:08:41,556 --> 01:08:42,790
They tried to use this

1371
01:08:42,824 --> 01:08:44,659
to defend the attack
against the main server.

1372
01:08:47,394 --> 01:08:49,262
They were too late.

1373
01:08:52,299 --> 01:08:53,668
The Council's last transmission

1374
01:08:53,701 --> 01:08:56,436
came from the main server
here in the headquarters.

1375
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:58,840
They underwent
a major code disruption.

1376
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,909
They're using the main server
to transmorph

1377
01:09:01,943 --> 01:09:03,176
all the remaining tech

1378
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:04,812
throughout the world
into Q-Bots.

1379
01:09:04,846 --> 01:09:07,180
Reena, they're attacking
all over.

1380
01:09:07,214 --> 01:09:09,249
And they're running
a countdown program...

1381
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:11,719
called Total Convergence.

1382
01:09:14,822 --> 01:09:16,356
It's gonna run out
when it takes down

1383
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:17,659
all the remaining firewalls
throughout the world.

1384
01:09:17,692 --> 01:09:19,292
Reena, we gotta
shut this thing down.

1385
01:09:19,326 --> 01:09:21,328
What if the Z-Bots turn on us?

1386
01:09:21,361 --> 01:09:23,230
Right now,
they're our only viable weapon

1387
01:09:23,263 --> 01:09:26,233
against Total Convergence,
all right?

1388
01:09:26,266 --> 01:09:28,670
Until they stop listening,
we can use them.

1389
01:09:30,605 --> 01:09:31,939
We'll go down,

1390
01:09:31,973 --> 01:09:34,474
have them disguise themselves
as computer banks...

1391
01:09:36,376 --> 01:09:38,813
and then maybe can beat
this thing ourselves.

1392
01:09:39,947 --> 01:09:41,348
- All right?
- Okay.

1393
01:09:41,381 --> 01:09:42,315
Let's go.

1394
01:09:49,023 --> 01:09:50,257
Here.

1395
01:09:53,795 --> 01:09:54,729
Let's go.

1396
01:09:59,867 --> 01:10:01,736
Man, it's burning hot
down here.

1397
01:10:01,769 --> 01:10:04,271
There must have
been a huge firefight.

1398
01:10:04,304 --> 01:10:06,507
Some of the areas
are still smoldering.

1399
01:10:09,443 --> 01:10:11,813
There is zero air
coming through.

1400
01:10:11,846 --> 01:10:13,313
I'm burning up.

1401
01:10:13,346 --> 01:10:15,415
Yeah, me, too.

1402
01:10:15,449 --> 01:10:16,584
Where's the safety
on this thing?

1403
01:10:16,617 --> 01:10:18,519
Does this even work?

1404
01:10:18,553 --> 01:10:19,486
Yeah, it's right here.

1405
01:10:20,955 --> 01:10:22,590
Did you think
there would be instructions

1406
01:10:22,623 --> 01:10:24,257
taped to the wall
in the armory?

1407
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:25,660
Yeah, you know what?
There should be.

1408
01:10:25,693 --> 01:10:27,528
There is zero military
down here.

1409
01:10:27,562 --> 01:10:30,230
We need Mom, Mark,
and about 500 troops.

1410
01:10:31,999 --> 01:10:34,535
Like, 12 Q-Bots
just marched inside.

1411
01:10:34,569 --> 01:10:36,604
I thought we were done
that time.

1412
01:10:36,637 --> 01:10:39,607
The fires must have obscured
their heat detection.

1413
01:10:41,441 --> 01:10:42,610
Either way...

1414
01:10:43,745 --> 01:10:45,445
something's wrong.

1415
01:10:45,479 --> 01:10:46,914
This isn't right.

1416
01:10:49,083 --> 01:10:51,418
Are the Z-Bots in position?

1417
01:10:51,451 --> 01:10:54,889
Yeah. Their disguise
as random computer banks

1418
01:10:54,922 --> 01:10:56,389
must have worked,
because the Q-Bots

1419
01:10:56,423 --> 01:10:57,859
didn't fire on them, either.

1420
01:10:57,892 --> 01:10:59,627
Then I guess
it's all or nothing.

1421
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:03,430
It better be a hell of a lot
more than that.

1422
01:11:03,463 --> 01:11:05,900
Z-Bots, storm the server room!

1423
01:11:09,003 --> 01:11:11,038
Trevor, Reena, stay down.

1424
01:11:11,072 --> 01:11:13,941
Listen to me! That server
is not an ordinary server!

1425
01:11:13,975 --> 01:11:16,978
It has been transmorphed!
It is extremely dangerous!

1426
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:18,746
Agnes,
drill and kill formation.

1427
01:11:20,681 --> 01:11:22,349
We can't just leave them.

1428
01:11:22,382 --> 01:11:23,551
We need to fight.

1429
01:11:23,584 --> 01:11:25,352
I'm with you.

1430
01:11:25,385 --> 01:11:26,687
Let's go.

1431
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:31,959
We got you, guys!

1432
01:11:31,993 --> 01:11:32,960
I'm out!

1433
01:11:35,495 --> 01:11:36,631
Get down!

1434
01:11:38,533 --> 01:11:39,934
What the hell was that?!

1435
01:11:39,967 --> 01:11:41,501
We need to pull back!

1436
01:11:48,876 --> 01:11:51,579
The Q-Bots just used an EMP
to disable our Z-Bots!

1437
01:11:51,612 --> 01:11:52,547
Oh, no.

1438
01:12:02,023 --> 01:12:04,725
- Mom, come on.
- Move! Move!

1439
01:12:04,759 --> 01:12:06,459
I knew you guys would make it.

1440
01:12:14,501 --> 01:12:16,804
Okay, we need to build
a bomb, scorched earth.

1441
01:12:16,838 --> 01:12:18,005
There's no time.

1442
01:12:18,039 --> 01:12:19,941
Those Z-Bots
you brought with you,

1443
01:12:19,974 --> 01:12:21,843
they--they attacked
the Q-Bot server.

1444
01:12:21,876 --> 01:12:23,110
Their coding is so old

1445
01:12:23,144 --> 01:12:24,679
the Q-Bots
can't seize control of them.

1446
01:12:24,712 --> 01:12:26,479
We have an army of Z-Bots.

1447
01:12:26,514 --> 01:12:28,015
They're in storage
in the armory.

1448
01:12:28,049 --> 01:12:30,084
We can't activate
an army of Z-Bots here.

1449
01:12:30,117 --> 01:12:32,385
- It's suicide.
- We're out of time.

1450
01:12:32,419 --> 01:12:35,723
We have 19 minutes until every
firewall on Earth goes down.

1451
01:12:35,756 --> 01:12:37,058
Then after that...

1452
01:12:37,091 --> 01:12:38,491
After that...

1453
01:12:38,526 --> 01:12:40,862
it's still a Convergence.

1454
01:12:40,895 --> 01:12:43,496
If we fail,
we go back underground,

1455
01:12:43,531 --> 01:12:45,432
and this time, for good.

1456
01:12:45,465 --> 01:12:48,102
Now you two stay down
when I tell you

1457
01:12:48,135 --> 01:12:49,971
this time, okay?
Do you understand me?

1458
01:12:50,004 --> 01:12:51,772
Okay.

1459
01:12:51,806 --> 01:12:53,440
I love you.

1460
01:12:53,473 --> 01:12:54,909
We're--We're gonna
come back for you

1461
01:12:54,942 --> 01:12:57,511
as soon
as everything's clear, okay?

1462
01:12:57,545 --> 01:12:59,547
Mark.

1463
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:01,616
You're brave as hell...

1464
01:13:01,649 --> 01:13:02,583
both of you.

1465
01:13:03,651 --> 01:13:04,752
We got this.

1466
01:13:06,453 --> 01:13:07,755
It's okay.

1467
01:13:14,562 --> 01:13:16,463
What's that sound?

1468
01:13:18,065 --> 01:13:19,133
It's malevolent code.

1469
01:13:20,935 --> 01:13:22,570
It's trying to take them over.

1470
01:13:38,552 --> 01:13:41,122
- Mark.
- Total Convergence achieved.

1471
01:13:41,155 --> 01:13:43,791
Kill all organics.

1472
01:13:43,824 --> 01:13:46,827
It's reached Total Convergence.

1473
01:13:52,499 --> 01:13:53,734
Reena!

1474
01:13:55,269 --> 01:13:57,171
We can't just leave them
in there to die.

1475
01:13:57,204 --> 01:13:58,806
Well, shooting at it
doesn't do anything,

1476
01:13:58,839 --> 01:14:00,174
other than piss it off.

1477
01:14:00,207 --> 01:14:02,543
If we can get above it...

1478
01:14:02,576 --> 01:14:04,946
there's a walkway
still intact above the T.C.

1479
01:14:07,548 --> 01:14:08,749
What are you
gonna do with that?

1480
01:14:08,783 --> 01:14:09,750
The T.C.'s already fused itself

1481
01:14:09,784 --> 01:14:11,018
with all the tech on Earth.

1482
01:14:11,052 --> 01:14:12,119
I don't know, Reena!

1483
01:14:12,153 --> 01:14:13,854
Might be a weapon
I can still use!

1484
01:14:14,922 --> 01:14:16,123
I can still use it!

1485
01:14:16,157 --> 01:14:17,892
It hasn't been seized
by anything yet.

1486
01:14:17,925 --> 01:14:19,260
No, it hasn't.

1487
01:14:19,293 --> 01:14:21,095
The T.C. hasn't fused itself
with all the tech.

1488
01:14:21,128 --> 01:14:22,930
It's trying to fuse itself
with all the tech.

1489
01:14:22,964 --> 01:14:25,266
Of course.
It's not a digital process.

1490
01:14:25,299 --> 01:14:26,634
It's a physical process.

1491
01:14:26,667 --> 01:14:28,636
It doesn't happen
instantaneously.

1492
01:14:28,669 --> 01:14:30,905
Do we know that for sure?

1493
01:14:30,938 --> 01:14:33,240
It would go against
the laws of physics.

1494
01:14:33,274 --> 01:14:34,842
The T.C.'s been reaching,

1495
01:14:34,875 --> 01:14:36,177
probing, capturing all over,

1496
01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:38,212
but--but that takes time.

1497
01:14:39,613 --> 01:14:41,215
So how do we
get up to that walkway?

1498
01:14:44,218 --> 01:14:45,286
Look, there's a way.

1499
01:14:47,154 --> 01:14:49,190
All right. Okay.

1500
01:14:59,867 --> 01:15:00,868
Trevor!

1501
01:15:03,838 --> 01:15:06,240
Reena! Reena!

1502
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,115
Reena. Come on. Come on.

1503
01:15:14,148 --> 01:15:15,750
I got you.
I got you. I got you.

1504
01:15:15,783 --> 01:15:17,551
I got you. I got you.
Come on. Come on.

1505
01:15:17,585 --> 01:15:19,086
- Reena, get down!
- Grab her!

1506
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,888
Go! Go! Go!

1507
01:15:20,921 --> 01:15:21,956
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1508
01:15:21,989 --> 01:15:23,624
Go! I'll cover you!

1509
01:15:23,657 --> 01:15:25,559
Come on! Come on!

1510
01:15:25,593 --> 01:15:26,560
Mark, come on!

1511
01:15:26,594 --> 01:15:28,295
- Go now!
- We need to go!

1512
01:15:30,698 --> 01:15:33,000
- Mom, Mom, Mom, we gotta go!
- Mark!

1513
01:15:33,034 --> 01:15:34,135
Mark!

1514
01:15:36,103 --> 01:15:37,338
- Mom, right here. Mom, Mom...
- Mom.

1515
01:15:37,371 --> 01:15:39,173
You have to get down.
Shield yourself.

1516
01:15:39,206 --> 01:15:40,908
We have nothing left
to shield ourselves with,

1517
01:15:40,941 --> 01:15:42,977
except for the Z-Bots, and
they're connected to the T.C.

1518
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:45,713
Can we shield ourselves
inside of the Z-Bots,

1519
01:15:45,746 --> 01:15:47,148
you and me?

1520
01:15:47,181 --> 01:15:49,116
They're only connected
by a thin set of wires,

1521
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:50,117
not like the lions.

1522
01:15:50,151 --> 01:15:51,285
Even if we get close enough,

1523
01:15:51,318 --> 01:15:52,887
we have nothing left
to hack them with,

1524
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,255
nothing left
to blow them up with. We--

1525
01:15:54,288 --> 01:15:55,256
Yeah, we do!

1526
01:15:56,824 --> 01:15:58,893
We show them with our minds.

1527
01:15:58,926 --> 01:16:01,829
They scan
human neural networks, right?

1528
01:16:01,862 --> 01:16:03,697
So let's give them
something to scan.

1529
01:16:03,731 --> 01:16:05,266
So, what?
What, we bombard them

1530
01:16:05,299 --> 01:16:06,801
with whatever directive
we can think of,

1531
01:16:06,834 --> 01:16:09,270
and then what? And then what?
We--What if--

1532
01:16:09,303 --> 01:16:10,771
What if we die?

1533
01:16:10,805 --> 01:16:12,773
Then we go down swinging.

1534
01:16:13,974 --> 01:16:14,909
Okay?

1535
01:16:17,378 --> 01:16:18,979
You really are my sister, huh?

1536
01:16:21,115 --> 01:16:22,683
I love you two...

1537
01:16:23,751 --> 01:16:25,653
so much.

1538
01:16:27,221 --> 01:16:30,958
I am so, so proud of you.

1539
01:16:48,275 --> 01:16:49,210
Okay.

1540
01:16:51,245 --> 01:16:53,247
We throw these
straight at the Z-Bots.

1541
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,982
It'll stun 'em, right?

1542
01:16:55,015 --> 01:16:56,050
It definitely
won't destroy 'em,

1543
01:16:56,083 --> 01:16:57,918
not with the T.C. in control.

1544
01:16:57,952 --> 01:16:59,286
But yeah. Yeah.

1545
01:17:01,155 --> 01:17:02,089
I love you.

1546
01:17:04,225 --> 01:17:05,326
Let's go.

1547
01:17:07,294 --> 01:17:08,629
Come on, Reena.

1548
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:24,044
You ready?

1549
01:17:24,078 --> 01:17:25,412
Throw 'em at the Z-Bots!

1550
01:17:25,446 --> 01:17:26,814
Blow a hole in their back!

1551
01:17:29,083 --> 01:17:30,885
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1552
01:17:30,918 --> 01:17:31,919
Now's our chance!

1553
01:17:31,952 --> 01:17:32,887
Let's go! Let's go!

1554
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:42,329
Z-Bot, provide voice radio
function to adjacent Z-Bot.

1555
01:17:44,265 --> 01:17:46,867
Z-Bot, provide voice radio
function to adjacent Z-Bot.

1556
01:17:48,402 --> 01:17:49,670
Reena, can you hear me?

1557
01:17:51,005 --> 01:17:52,473
Reena, can you hear me?

1558
01:17:52,507 --> 01:17:54,808
Trevor? I can hear you.

1559
01:17:58,345 --> 01:17:59,880
Find those electrodes,

1560
01:17:59,914 --> 01:18:02,249
the one on the Z-Bot circuit
the colonel showed us.

1561
01:18:02,283 --> 01:18:03,918
I'm looking.

1562
01:18:05,452 --> 01:18:06,787
I think I found 'em.

1563
01:18:07,988 --> 01:18:10,724
Ohh. That's so weird.

1564
01:18:10,758 --> 01:18:11,992
Reena, what's wrong?
What is it?

1565
01:18:14,762 --> 01:18:15,896
Reena, what?!

1566
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:19,066
I-I can feel, like, this...

1567
01:18:19,099 --> 01:18:21,235
flow of information
going through my brain.

1568
01:18:22,537 --> 01:18:25,206
It's--It's inside of my head.

1569
01:18:25,239 --> 01:18:27,341
I'm seeing what it sees.

1570
01:18:28,909 --> 01:18:31,378
Trevor, you have
to fight against it.

1571
01:18:31,412 --> 01:18:33,180
I'm trying.

1572
01:18:33,214 --> 01:18:35,115
I think I can control it.

1573
01:18:38,452 --> 01:18:41,288
I'm unable to get through
to the others.

1574
01:18:41,322 --> 01:18:44,291
The whole system's
rejecting it. Ohh!

1575
01:18:44,325 --> 01:18:46,360
It's trying
to take over my mind!

1576
01:18:46,393 --> 01:18:48,028
Me, too.

1577
01:18:48,062 --> 01:18:50,164
Just keep thinking
of the whole army

1578
01:18:50,197 --> 01:18:52,099
turning against the T.C., okay?

1579
01:18:52,132 --> 01:18:53,367
I'm gonna try again.

1580
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:02,009
It's trying to shock me
into unconsciousness.

1581
01:19:02,042 --> 01:19:03,545
It's no use.

1582
01:19:05,446 --> 01:19:07,549
Trevor, I can sense them.

1583
01:19:07,582 --> 01:19:10,884
The rest of the lion-bots
are headed our way.

1584
01:19:10,918 --> 01:19:13,020
They're coming from everywhere.

1585
01:19:13,053 --> 01:19:14,888
They know what we're doing.

1586
01:19:14,922 --> 01:19:16,257
I can read
the T.C.'s directives.

1587
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:17,559
It knows we're in here, Reena.

1588
01:19:17,592 --> 01:19:19,393
It knows we're hiding
inside the--

1589
01:19:19,426 --> 01:19:20,928
the Z-Bots.

1590
01:19:22,863 --> 01:19:24,932
It's trying to kill me.

1591
01:19:28,068 --> 01:19:29,571
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1592
01:19:29,604 --> 01:19:32,473
Take me! Take me!

1593
01:19:32,507 --> 01:19:35,876
Reena, we need to create
a feedback loop.

1594
01:19:35,909 --> 01:19:37,444
We could loop the circuit
back in on itself,

1595
01:19:37,478 --> 01:19:40,347
like Mom's EMPs.

1596
01:19:40,381 --> 01:19:42,449
We need to touch
the Z-Bots' heads together.

1597
01:19:42,483 --> 01:19:44,918
- What?
- <i>Reena, we need to touch</i>

1598
01:19:44,952 --> 01:19:47,288
the Z-Bots' heads together,
like we did when we were kids.

1599
01:19:47,321 --> 01:19:50,391
Human thought and emotion
flowing in a loop.

1600
01:19:50,424 --> 01:19:54,028
It's a process the T.C.
can't possibly understand.

1601
01:19:58,065 --> 01:19:59,933
Think about Mom, all right?

1602
01:19:59,967 --> 01:20:01,035
Think about us.

1603
01:20:02,102 --> 01:20:04,606
The pain is too much.

1604
01:20:04,639 --> 01:20:06,407
Just breathe.

1605
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,208
Reena, breathe.

1606
01:20:08,242 --> 01:20:10,110
Focus on my voice.

1607
01:20:10,144 --> 01:20:11,945
Think about us
when we were kids.

1608
01:20:11,979 --> 01:20:13,314
Just breathe.

1609
01:20:13,347 --> 01:20:14,848
Reena, breathe.

1610
01:20:14,882 --> 01:20:16,917
Focus on my voice.

1611
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:19,119
Okay, I'm breathing.

1612
01:20:20,954 --> 01:20:22,489
I'm thinking about Mom.

1613
01:20:24,024 --> 01:20:25,225
I'm thinking about when Mom

1614
01:20:25,259 --> 01:20:27,127
used to play with us
in the backyard.

1615
01:20:28,896 --> 01:20:30,998
I'm thinking about Dad.

1616
01:20:31,031 --> 01:20:33,267
Think about Dad, Trev.

1617
01:20:37,605 --> 01:20:40,874
The T.C. can't under--
understand this process.

1618
01:20:40,908 --> 01:20:42,644
It can't understand
this directive.

1619
01:20:42,677 --> 01:20:44,345
It doesn't understand
pain or fear.

1620
01:20:48,982 --> 01:20:50,518
Or love.

1621
01:20:53,621 --> 01:20:54,622
I love you, Mom.

1622
01:20:57,291 --> 01:20:59,059
I love you, Dad.

1623
01:21:07,134 --> 01:21:08,936
Reena. Reena!

1624
01:21:10,971 --> 01:21:11,972
Reena!

1625
01:21:14,007 --> 01:21:16,176
Is it gone?

1626
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:17,444
Is it dead?

1627
01:21:19,681 --> 01:21:20,981
The whole place is gone.

1628
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:26,253
There isn't a single connection
left to the main server.

1629
01:21:26,286 --> 01:21:29,923
It just kept cycling
our emotions over and over.

1630
01:21:29,957 --> 01:21:32,594
Until it melted
the whole system.

1631
01:21:34,328 --> 01:21:35,597
Mom.

1632
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:36,964
- Reena.
- Mom!

1633
01:21:36,997 --> 01:21:38,031
- Mom!
- Mom!

1634
01:21:38,065 --> 01:21:39,433
Mom! Come here!

1635
01:21:39,466 --> 01:21:41,603
I got--I got you. I got you.

1636
01:21:44,471 --> 01:21:46,641
We won. We did it.
We won. We destroyed it.

1637
01:21:46,674 --> 01:21:48,008
Aw, I love you.

1638
01:21:49,076 --> 01:21:51,345
I am so proud of you.

1639
01:21:51,378 --> 01:21:52,614
Both!

1640
01:21:52,647 --> 01:21:54,616
I'm so proud of you.

1641
01:22:01,656 --> 01:22:02,923
Wait.

1642
01:22:09,129 --> 01:22:10,431
It's the voice interface.

1643
01:22:14,001 --> 01:22:16,003
Z-Bot, baseline directive?

1644
01:22:17,104 --> 01:22:19,072
Baseline: world repair.

1645
01:22:19,106 --> 01:22:21,576
Function: protect human race.

1646
01:22:24,679 --> 01:22:25,946
We won.

1647
01:22:28,148 --> 01:22:29,584
It's over.

1648
01:22:34,455 --> 01:22:36,390
Where's Mark?

1649
01:22:38,526 --> 01:22:41,696
Last time I saw him, he was
pushing us away to safety.

1650
01:22:41,729 --> 01:22:44,097
- Mark!
- Mark!

1651
01:22:44,131 --> 01:22:45,466
- Mark!
- Mark!

1652
01:22:45,499 --> 01:22:46,534
There's a rifle!

1653
01:22:48,068 --> 01:22:49,571
Hey, this is his.
This is his!

1654
01:22:51,271 --> 01:22:53,440
He wouldn't just lay down
and die. He'd fight.

1655
01:22:53,474 --> 01:22:55,275
Mark!

1656
01:22:55,309 --> 01:22:56,443
Hey, hey, here!

1657
01:22:57,745 --> 01:22:59,046
He's right here!

1658
01:22:59,079 --> 01:23:00,414
Careful. He's still alive!

1659
01:23:03,383 --> 01:23:04,619
Oh, my--Where are the--

1660
01:23:04,652 --> 01:23:06,721
Easy. Easy, sweetheart.

1661
01:23:06,754 --> 01:23:08,656
Easy.

1662
01:23:08,690 --> 01:23:10,157
Where are they? Where are--

1663
01:23:13,393 --> 01:23:15,429
There are no more of them.

1664
01:23:15,462 --> 01:23:17,397
We got them...

1665
01:23:18,465 --> 01:23:19,500
all of them.

1666
01:23:20,735 --> 01:23:21,669
We won.

1667
01:23:24,071 --> 01:23:25,005
For Mom.

1668
01:23:27,441 --> 01:23:28,710
For Mark Oros.

1669
01:23:33,748 --> 01:23:35,182
For you.

1670
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:38,085
Come here. Come here.
