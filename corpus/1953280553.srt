1
00:00:24,447 --> 00:00:29,149
FORTUNE COOKIE

2
00:01:57,379 --> 00:02:01,923
Get the fuck out of here you
skinny strand of dickweed!

3
00:02:02,043 --> 00:02:05,038
I'll break your fucking neck
with my pinky.

4
00:02:05,355 --> 00:02:07,924
You probably got a dick
the size of the can right there.

5
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:11,928
Well if it isn't Nolan Ryan.

6
00:02:12,405 --> 00:02:14,693
How many strikeouts this week?

7
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,099
Hey Jack.

8
00:02:17,576 --> 00:02:21,707
So what are you gonna do with
your commision this week Broadneck?

9
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:22,756
Well.

10
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,558
What? Don't tell me you haven't
sold anything.

11
00:02:29,111 --> 00:02:33,179
- How long's it been?
- Well about   - Three months.

12
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,784
Three fucking months.

13
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,420
And Petterson
still hasn't canned you?

14
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,121
God. She must have
the hots for you.

15
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:48,125
Well she says it's just a
bad streak and...

16
00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:52,364
...all I need is some confidence.

17
00:02:52,484 --> 00:02:57,047
Don't you believe it, Broadneck.
She's just being nice to you.

18
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:06,005
A salesman sells.
It is that simple.

19
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:14,009
A salesman sells. And when he's
not selling, he's not a salesman.

20
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:19,117
And who needs a salesman
that's not selling?

21
00:03:21,342 --> 00:03:24,329
You're at the end
of your line, Broadneck.

22
00:03:25,764 --> 00:03:31,293
But I've got the answer
to all your problems!

23
00:03:31,706 --> 00:03:33,136
What you need...

24
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,784
...is a lucky charm.

25
00:03:39,994 --> 00:03:41,360
I don't know Jack.

26
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:45,643
I've been wearing my lucky tie
for a month now and...

27
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:47,868
...and my lucky shoes
for two months.

28
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:51,407
And I've lost as many sales
with these as with any.

29
00:03:51,527 --> 00:03:58,614
No Harold. You don't get it.
These are necessities, not charms.

30
00:04:01,497 --> 00:04:06,137
What you need is something
from mother nature.

31
00:04:06,805 --> 00:04:11,858
Something untamed.
Something wild.

32
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,317
Representing luck.

33
00:04:15,144 --> 00:04:16,574
Coated with luck.

34
00:04:16,694 --> 00:04:18,898
Distilled with luck.

35
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:25,922
Tested for decades. Revered for
centuries. Honored for millenia.

36
00:04:27,026 --> 00:04:32,809
You need a lucky rabbit's foot.

37
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:44,013
- How much this time?
- Oh christ Broadneck.

38
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:49,543
We're getting into routine here.
I'm starting to feel sorry for you.

39
00:04:52,268 --> 00:04:58,274
Here. This ones on the house.

40
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:15,687
Think of it as a farewell
gesture of charity.

41
00:05:19,372 --> 00:05:22,518
- What do you mean?
- I'm outta here Broadneck.

42
00:05:22,638 --> 00:05:25,834
Petterson says I'm the front-running
for the Omega account.

43
00:05:25,954 --> 00:05:28,122
- Omega?
- Yeah Omega.

44
00:05:28,723 --> 00:05:33,630
Top dog. And once I get the Omega
account I'm outta this jungle.

45
00:05:33,886 --> 00:05:36,352
Away from scum like you.

46
00:05:38,926 --> 00:05:39,994
And him.

47
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:43,524
It's Wilson.

48
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:49,550
You know, he might be the only person
around here as pathetic as you.

49
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:53,926
Look at the balls on that man.

50
00:05:54,383 --> 00:05:57,688
He's trying for my Mrs. Penapult.

51
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,035
She only goes for the legends.

52
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:03,705
Ricky "two-tongue" Greenblatt.

53
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:07,137
Eddie "endurance" Palestrani

54
00:06:09,224 --> 00:06:13,114
Man she sucks a mean dick.

55
00:06:15,217 --> 00:06:16,005
Oh look.

56
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,014
He's prancing the mound.

57
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,048
There's the wind up.

58
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,455
And the pitch.

59
00:06:33,514 --> 00:06:37,633
That hurts. So much for Wilson!

60
00:06:40,657 --> 00:06:41,293
Hey.

61
00:06:42,882 --> 00:06:44,074
Why don't you try?

62
00:06:48,443 --> 00:06:49,953
No. No.

63
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,747
Well, I've see enough
anguish for one day.

64
00:06:54,867 --> 00:06:58,284
I'm gonna go get myself
a good lunch, hell I deserve it.

65
00:06:58,515 --> 00:06:59,151
You hungry?

66
00:07:00,193 --> 00:07:02,888
Some of my luck
may run off on you.

67
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:07,058
No I've gotta make a sale.

68
00:07:09,908 --> 00:07:12,298
You give him hell Broadneck.

69
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:29,307
You make me love you.

70
00:08:30,783 --> 00:08:33,325
I didn't want to do it.

71
00:08:33,935 --> 00:08:36,554
I didn't want to do it.

72
00:08:37,093 --> 00:08:41,466
I want your love, that's true.

73
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:46,017
Yes I do. Indeed I do.
You know I do.

74
00:08:46,504 --> 00:08:50,673
Give me give me give me
give me what I cry for.

75
00:08:50,966 --> 00:08:54,144
You know you got
the kind of kisses.

76
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:57,007
That I'd die for.

77
00:08:57,235 --> 00:09:04,610
You know you made
me love you, baby!

78
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:10,044
Hello could I speak with
Mrs. Petterson please?

79
00:09:12,002 --> 00:09:13,121
Harold Broadneck.

80
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:19,592
No I didn't. Listen could you
just get me Mrs. Petterson, please?

81
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:24,981
Oh hi, Mrs. Petterson.

82
00:09:26,953 --> 00:09:31,204
Well it's been a bit slow.
Not many bites.

83
00:09:32,554 --> 00:09:34,382
No, no big ones.

84
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:38,553
No. No small ones.

85
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:45,670
Well I guess I didn't sell any.

86
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:53,456
Yes I know Mrs. Petterson, three
months. But I'm trying though Ma'am.

87
00:09:55,407 --> 00:09:57,989
I know, but I need this job.

88
00:10:00,293 --> 00:10:01,405
Please, Mrs. Petterson.

89
00:10:04,712 --> 00:10:07,175
My last day?
But Mrs. Petterson.

90
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:10,919
Alright.

91
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:13,263
I understand.

92
00:10:16,004 --> 00:10:16,838
I'll try.

93
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,559
Yeah I know. Confidence.

94
00:10:23,306 --> 00:10:24,776
Yes. Yes.

95
00:10:25,849 --> 00:10:26,802
Confidence.

96
00:11:09,205 --> 00:11:11,788
Take courage, today
is your day for success.

97
00:11:29,948 --> 00:11:35,827
Take courage, today
is your day for success.

98
00:11:40,986 --> 00:11:42,972
Hey sure, why not?

99
00:11:44,124 --> 00:11:45,792
Everybody has their day.

100
00:11:47,302 --> 00:11:49,209
I've had my share of losers.

101
00:11:51,402 --> 00:11:53,150
Don't you see?

102
00:11:55,573 --> 00:11:57,003
I've had my losers.

103
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:02,009
It could be my day.
Or even your day.

104
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:04,005
That's right.

105
00:12:05,236 --> 00:12:06,626
Just a bad streak.

106
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:09,407
Everybody has bad streaks.

107
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,444
4.95...

108
00:12:19,596 --> 00:12:21,304
...and a 50 cents tip.

109
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,263
- Hello.
- Oh a salesman.

110
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:05,110
- What are you selling?
- Oh, quite a few things.

111
00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:08,388
Perhaps, it would be
more comfortable if...

112
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:11,804
Oh come in. Would you like
a glass of ice tea?

113
00:13:12,678 --> 00:13:15,300
- Please.   - With a slice of lemons?
- Please.

114
00:13:27,883 --> 00:13:28,757
I did it!

115
00:13:31,463 --> 00:13:35,555
I sold a large one, and a small one.
I could be salesman of the month!

116
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:37,739
- Can I help you?
- Yeah!

117
00:13:39,294 --> 00:13:41,200
- I need a fortune cookie.
- No.

118
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:45,623
Okay, I'll pay for it.

119
00:13:46,789 --> 00:13:47,908
Order some food.

120
00:13:48,734 --> 00:13:49,649
I'm not hungry.

121
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:53,386
Eat some fucking food.

122
00:13:53,997 --> 00:13:54,636
Okay fine.

123
00:13:57,029 --> 00:13:58,123
Get me an eggdrop soup.

124
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:02,267
And dont forget
the fortune cookie.

125
00:15:00,091 --> 00:15:00,854
Thank you.

126
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:09,301
Thank you.

127
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:22,191
Yes. Two straight weeks now.

128
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:24,428
It's been incredible
Mrs. Petterson.

129
00:15:26,618 --> 00:15:28,474
Success comes
to the successful man.

130
00:15:30,536 --> 00:15:31,121
Omega?

131
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,163
Of course I've heard of the Omega
account. It's every salesman's dream.

132
00:15:36,256 --> 00:15:37,705
Of course I'm interested.

133
00:15:39,383 --> 00:15:40,019
Promotion?

134
00:15:40,845 --> 00:15:41,760
Corporate staff?

135
00:15:44,122 --> 00:15:45,838
Aww c'mon, what pressure?

136
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:48,603
I'm a salesman, Mrs. Petterson.

137
00:15:50,512 --> 00:15:52,133
And a salesman sells.

138
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:54,739
Thank you.

139
00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:42,795
Hey Mr. Salesman.

140
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:44,670
How are you doing?

141
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:49,271
Listen, if you want to fuck
my wife, you can fuck my wife.

142
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,862
You want to fuck my wife?
You can fuck my wife.

143
00:16:54,695 --> 00:16:56,761
What's the problem? You gay?

144
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:00,972
First you could fuck my wife,
then you could fuck me!

145
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:02,839
Then I'll fuck the both of you.

146
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:04,587
What do you say?

147
00:17:08,492 --> 00:17:09,564
Fuck off!

148
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:29,594
Wow, Broadneck!
What's your hurry?

149
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:31,541
- I've got to use the bathroom.
- You know Broadneck...

150
00:17:31,661 --> 00:17:34,758
I've been hearing some strange things.
Wilson's been telling me that you're...

151
00:17:34,878 --> 00:17:37,014
...the number one man now.

152
00:17:37,134 --> 00:17:41,741
Something like three straight
weeks without a strikeout.

153
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,529
I really got
to use the toilet, Jack.

154
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:46,349
You're making my sales look
like a rookie, Broadneck!

155
00:17:46,469 --> 00:17:49,488
And in a couple days Petterson's going
to give you a chance at Omega?!

156
00:17:49,608 --> 00:17:51,384
- Now what's up?
- Nothing.

157
00:17:52,377 --> 00:17:54,840
Broadneck. I know you.

158
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,635
You're a loser. You couldn't sell
shit to a fly, but somehow you are.

159
00:18:00,755 --> 00:18:03,535
Now what's your deal?
Late night deals with the devil?

160
00:18:03,852 --> 00:18:06,037
Nothing! I've got to shit!

161
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,227
You've got to poop?

162
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,405
Well I'll join you.

163
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:15,863
My rabbit's feet, isn't it?

164
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:19,239
Fuck your rabbit's feet.

165
00:18:19,969 --> 00:18:22,193
Throwing him out was the
brightest thing I ever did.

166
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:46,966
Jesus Broadneck!
What have you been eating?!

167
00:18:50,108 --> 00:18:52,015
Fucking Chinese food.

168
00:18:55,073 --> 00:18:57,020
So that's it.

169
00:18:58,391 --> 00:19:02,204
- What are you talking about?
- It's the Chinese food!

170
00:19:03,797 --> 00:19:04,671
What do you mean?

171
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:09,915
Oh c'mon, I'm a salesman too.
We've all got our little games.

172
00:19:10,035 --> 00:19:14,364
Yours just happens to be
a particular Chinese restaurant.

173
00:19:14,484 --> 00:19:18,453
At a particular time of day.
In a particular booth.

174
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:21,860
Eating a particular plate of food?

175
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,598
What is it Broadneck?
Moo goo gai pan?

176
00:19:25,854 --> 00:19:28,321
Shrimp and lobster sauce?

177
00:19:28,575 --> 00:19:31,143
Subgum chop suey?

178
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,152
C'mon Broadneck!
You're addicting to a ritual.

179
00:19:36,272 --> 00:19:39,435
Only yours makes you shit
like a fucking dog.

180
00:19:39,765 --> 00:19:42,333
Fucking Chinese food.

181
00:19:47,093 --> 00:19:48,669
It's not the food.

182
00:19:50,118 --> 00:19:51,669
Well what is it?

183
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:58,000
C'mon Broadneck.
You can tell me.

184
00:20:03,037 --> 00:20:04,410
Say uhh...

185
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:07,817
...please...

186
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:16,341
C'mon Broadneck. Since this find
of yours, I've been slipping.

187
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,646
I haven't had a sale in a week.

188
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:23,459
Say please.

189
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,197
Help me out, Harold.

190
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:29,053
Say it.

191
00:20:29,921 --> 00:20:32,057
Okay. Okay.

192
00:20:32,947 --> 00:20:35,108
Please.

193
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,421
That wasn't so hard.

194
00:20:40,856 --> 00:20:42,001
How about...

195
00:20:42,814 --> 00:20:48,969
Pretty please, with sugar on top,
Mr. salesman of the month, sir.

196
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:56,608
C'mon Harry! I need to know!

197
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,609
Say it!

198
00:21:06,976 --> 00:21:16,081
Please, with sugar on top, Mr. salesman
oh God, I can't remember. C'mon Harry.

199
00:21:16,996 --> 00:21:18,369
Show some mercy.

200
00:21:18,957 --> 00:21:22,618
I'm begging you. Please!

201
00:21:24,093 --> 00:21:24,906
Okay!

202
00:21:25,822 --> 00:21:29,178
Okay okay okay! Don't sob!

203
00:21:30,805 --> 00:21:33,017
Here, look!

204
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:42,097
A mystical,
magical fortune cookie.

205
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,253
Hey, I didn't say to open it!

206
00:21:46,423 --> 00:21:48,813
I had to spend 4.95 for that!

207
00:21:49,552 --> 00:21:51,662
Wow.

208
00:21:55,553 --> 00:21:56,596
What's it say Jack?

209
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,757
Nothing.

210
00:22:00,005 --> 00:22:03,107
What do you mean nothing?
C'mon what's it say Jack?

211
00:22:03,227 --> 00:22:07,429
If I tell you
it won't come true.

212
00:22:07,756 --> 00:22:11,235
It's not yours! I just gave you
that cookie to look at!

213
00:22:11,488 --> 00:22:15,632
- The fortune belongs to me!
- No! It's mine!

214
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:18,381
It's a good one too isn't it?
That's why you're keeping it!

215
00:22:18,991 --> 00:22:20,898
C'mon give it, you fuck!

216
00:22:22,195 --> 00:22:25,449
Get out of my way! I want
that cookie! I want that cookie!

217
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:29,797
Give it! Give it!
I want it, give it to me!

218
00:22:30,652 --> 00:22:32,304
Give it! Look at it!

219
00:22:33,283 --> 00:22:36,931
Okay. This is the best one yet!
You tried to keep it!

220
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:41,841
Prepare of mounds of fucking! Or should
throw in fucking Chinese food, Jack!

221
00:22:43,317 --> 00:22:45,198
Yes, it's mine.

222
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:54,470
Fame, Jack.

223
00:22:58,131 --> 00:22:58,767
A legend.

224
00:23:00,217 --> 00:23:03,725
Penapult?
You're not going after Penapult?!

225
00:23:04,973 --> 00:23:05,609
Watch.

226
00:23:06,067 --> 00:23:07,719
You can't do it Broadneck.

227
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:11,078
- You're nothing but a superstitious
loser!   - What's going on?

228
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:16,278
- She's going to embarrass Broadneck!
- Broadneck's going after Penapult?

229
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:17,397
Shit, man.

230
00:23:20,285 --> 00:23:25,168
- Well, who are you?
- Harold Ma'am. Harold Broadneck.

231
00:23:26,032 --> 00:23:28,396
- What have you got for sale?
- Quite a few things.

232
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:33,001
Perhaps we would be
more comfortable if we uhh...

233
00:23:35,111 --> 00:23:36,281
...did this inside.

234
00:23:37,857 --> 00:23:38,798
Of course.

235
00:23:46,253 --> 00:23:48,109
A legend, how
do you think he does it?

236
00:23:48,389 --> 00:23:52,533
- Lucky charms, it's all lucky charms.
- What's his angle?

237
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,519
Rabbit's feet.

238
00:24:02,197 --> 00:24:03,595
Can I interest you in a foot?

239
00:24:05,604 --> 00:24:06,900
Hi, Mrs. Petterson.

240
00:24:07,892 --> 00:24:10,734
Listen I'm coming in to polish up
some last minute details...

241
00:24:10,854 --> 00:24:11,985
...for the Omega pitch tomorrow.

242
00:24:14,032 --> 00:24:14,489
What?

243
00:24:16,364 --> 00:24:17,559
You're leaving the country?

244
00:24:18,703 --> 00:24:19,949
For how long?

245
00:24:22,008 --> 00:24:22,923
For that long?

246
00:24:25,262 --> 00:24:27,680
And they want me
to pitch today?

247
00:24:28,547 --> 00:24:29,615
In half an hour?

248
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:31,648
No.

249
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:33,962
No I'm ready.

250
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,646
I know how much time
went into this.

251
00:24:39,968 --> 00:24:40,756
And money.

252
00:24:42,662 --> 00:24:43,171
No.

253
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:46,757
No I won't crack Mrs. Petterson.

254
00:24:49,426 --> 00:24:49,960
Right.

255
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:52,464
Right.

256
00:24:54,269 --> 00:24:55,667
Half an hour, I'll be there.

257
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:58,464
Right.

258
00:25:00,396 --> 00:25:01,515
Yeah. Bye.

259
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:38,031
There are times when the wisest
thing to do is nothing.

260
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:02,471
Sometimes inaction is
better then action.

261
00:26:46,547 --> 00:26:46,903
Okay.

262
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:19,990
All good things
must come to an end?
