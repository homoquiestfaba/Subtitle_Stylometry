Hey there, handsome.

1925
01:26:49,905 --> 01:26:51,139
Hey.
Hm.

1926
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:53,709
You got that Tim Robbins
thing going for you.

1927
01:26:53,776 --> 01:26:56,845
You know, like at the end
of Shawshank Redemption.

1928
01:26:56,912 --> 01:26:59,515
That would make you, what?
Morgan Freeman?

1929
01:26:59,582 --> 01:27:01,083
Exactly.

1930
01:27:01,149 --> 01:27:02,285
I'm sorry we're late.

1931
01:27:02,351 --> 01:27:04,420
We had...some issues.

1932
01:27:07,089 --> 01:27:10,225
You look like crap.
Thank you.

1933
01:27:10,293 --> 01:27:11,427
Good to see
you too, Mother.

1934
01:27:11,494 --> 01:27:13,762
Hi, Daddy.
Hey, pumpkin.

1935
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:17,333
Hey. Let me get that for you.
Hey.

1936
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:19,402
Why, thank you.

1937
01:27:19,468 --> 01:27:20,536
What's with the, uh--?

1938
01:27:20,603 --> 01:27:22,104
Real-time product
placement.

1939
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:24,239
Real-time what?
[GRUNTS]

1940
01:27:24,307 --> 01:27:26,141
What's this thing cost?
AUDREY: Nothing.

1941
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:27,776
Nothing?
Yeah.

1942
01:27:27,843 --> 01:27:29,778
COLBY:
Well, nothing as long as
we drive 400 miles a week

1943
01:27:29,845 --> 01:27:32,681
around upper-middle-income
neighborhoods, nothing.

1944
01:27:32,748 --> 01:27:34,116
HARVEY:
What do you mean nothing?

1945
01:27:34,182 --> 01:27:36,585
COLBY:
Oh, I mean, I went to Hummer
of Sherman Oaks.

1946
01:27:36,652 --> 01:27:37,953
Got them to play ball
in exchange

1947
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:40,122
for plastering their name
everywhere.
[SIGHS]

1948
01:27:40,188 --> 01:27:42,658
Then made a bunch of deals
with several corporate sponsors.

1949
01:27:42,725 --> 01:27:44,126
Okay, I don't
even wanna know.

1950
01:27:44,192 --> 01:27:45,528
Forget I asked.

1951
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:47,996
COLBY:
So...Dad...

1952
01:27:48,063 --> 01:27:50,466
I've been coming up with a plan
to get us back on our feet

1953
01:27:50,533 --> 01:27:52,167
and out of Grandma's
house fast.

1954
01:27:52,234 --> 01:27:55,704
Don't do me any favors.
No one's asking you to stay.

1955
01:27:55,771 --> 01:27:58,006
Do you think I'm gonna
listen for a second

1956
01:27:58,073 --> 01:28:01,109
to anything you come up with
after what I've been through?

1957
01:28:01,176 --> 01:28:03,579
DORIS:
So, Harvey, I'm gonna
need to be paid back

1958
01:28:03,646 --> 01:28:06,615
now that you're, well,
able-bodied.

1959
01:28:06,682 --> 01:28:09,618
I mean, I-- I'm out
a lot of money.

1960
01:28:09,685 --> 01:28:11,219
Mom, we're not even
a mile

1961
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:12,755
from where I spent
the last three years

1962
01:28:12,821 --> 01:28:14,757
being someone's girlfriend.
AUDREY: Gross.

1963
01:28:14,823 --> 01:28:16,959
Think this might wait
until we hit the freeway.

1964
01:28:17,025 --> 01:28:17,960
Or until I get a job?

1965
01:28:18,026 --> 01:28:20,663
What about the 300K?

1966
01:28:20,729 --> 01:28:23,366
Everybody knows
you salted it away someplace.

1967
01:28:23,432 --> 01:28:26,369
I don't have 300K, Mother.
I never had it.

1968
01:28:26,435 --> 01:28:27,636
Someone else here
might know

1969
01:28:27,703 --> 01:28:29,905
where it went,
but I sure don't.

1970
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:31,540
[***]

1971
01:28:31,607 --> 01:28:33,409
Don't look at me.
We thought you had it.

1972
01:28:33,476 --> 01:28:34,543
AUDREY:
Yeah, Daddy.

1973
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:37,079
I told you,
I don't have it.

1974
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:39,715
Well, if you don't,
where the hell did it go?

1975
01:28:42,084 --> 01:28:43,118
HARVEY AND COLBY:
Randi.

1976
01:28:43,185 --> 01:28:44,219
Thanks.

1977
01:28:44,286 --> 01:28:45,421
[***]

1978
01:28:45,488 --> 01:28:47,155
Hi.
VALET: Do you have the ticket?

1979
01:28:47,222 --> 01:28:51,059
MAN:
Got it. I think I parked in,
uh, Section 1-6.

1980
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:57,032
VALET 1: Welcome to Ciro's.
Thank you.

1981
01:28:57,099 --> 01:29:00,669
VALET 2: Welcome to Ciro's.
GARRY: Ah, thank you, my man.

1982
01:29:00,736 --> 01:29:03,205
There's a bit of
Italian heaven in L.A.

1983
01:29:03,271 --> 01:29:05,608
Look how packed
this place is, Chloe.

1984
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:07,943
You did confirm our reservations
for all six, huh?

1985
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:09,044
Uh, right, Garry.

1986
01:29:09,111 --> 01:29:10,879
I confirmed them last week
and this morning.

1987
01:29:10,946 --> 01:29:13,015
We've been on their waiting
list for two weeks.

1988
01:29:13,081 --> 01:29:14,349
And you used
my name?

1989
01:29:14,417 --> 01:29:16,752
Of course. It would have been
a month otherwise.

1990
01:29:16,819 --> 01:29:18,253
I'm so happy
for Randi.

1991
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:21,424
That kid must be
printing money in here.

1992
01:29:21,490 --> 01:29:23,225
Hi, Mr. Marshall.

1993
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:25,260
Randi. You look
beautiful.

1994
01:29:25,327 --> 01:29:28,597
Mr. Marshall, Chloe.
You look wonderful.

1995
01:29:28,664 --> 01:29:30,733
Come, please. We have
your table all ready for you.

1996
01:29:30,799 --> 01:29:32,568
The other people
are on their way.

1997
01:29:32,635 --> 01:29:34,269
Looks like business
is booming.

1998
01:29:34,336 --> 01:29:36,705
RANDI: It is booming.
Where's your partner in crime?

1999
01:29:36,772 --> 01:29:38,240
RANDI: Here he is.
CIRO: Garry.

2000
01:29:38,306 --> 01:29:39,875
Hi!
Hey, hey.

2001
01:29:39,942 --> 01:29:40,776
Hey!

2002
01:29:40,843 --> 01:29:42,611
Chloe. Good to see you.
Ciro.

2003
01:29:42,678 --> 01:29:45,548
Please, please,
be seated. Be seated.

2004
01:29:45,614 --> 01:29:47,716
What can I get you
tonight? The rigatoni?

2005
01:29:47,783 --> 01:29:50,385
No, no, no.
Your masterpiece.

2006
01:29:50,453 --> 01:29:52,320
Lobster Agnolotti.
Ah.

2007
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:54,423
Lobster Agnolotti.
Sauce on the side.

2008
01:29:54,490 --> 01:29:55,791
Sauce on
the side.

2009
01:29:55,858 --> 01:29:57,493
Coming right up.
You got it. Okay.

2010
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:59,161
Good. He cooks
without his shoes on.

2011
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:00,162
Yeah.
Cannot cook

2012
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:01,464
or make love
in shoes.

2013
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:02,798
I'll be-- I'll be
right back, okay?

2014
01:30:02,865 --> 01:30:04,833
But he doesn't put
his toes in the lobster.

2015
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:05,834
God, I hope not.

2016
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:06,835
[LAUGHTER]

2017
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:09,137
