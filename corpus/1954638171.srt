Well, now, it's a beautiful sunny day,

517
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:27,213
just perfect for our experiment.

518
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,424
I have everything I need
here in my wee bag.

519
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,634
Are we going to witness an explosion?

520
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,553
Oh, goodness me! No, I hope not.

521
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:35,555
I'm astounded
you have all your paraphernalia

522
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:38,850
- contained in yon small pouch.
- Indeed it is, Mr Turner.

523
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,967
Everything except God's good sunlight.

524
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,647
Daddy, Mrs Somerville
is a natural philosopher.

525
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:48,818
- Is she, now?
- Mathematician, astronomer, geologist.

526
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:51,696
The universe is a wondrous thing,
is it not, Mr Turner?

527
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,448
It is, to be sure.

528
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:54,991
The planets and the stars,

529
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:57,202
the oceans and the tides,

530
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,704
the clouds and the air,

531
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:01,915
mountains, volcanoes...

532
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:04,709
The tides be subject
to the effect of the moon.

533
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:08,713
Quite so,
the mysterious force of gravity.

534
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,872
It is my strong belief

535
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,376
that all things on this earth
are connected.

536
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,505
- Nothing exists in isolation.
- Indeed.

537
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:23,311
The rain falls, the sun shines

538
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:25,355
and the onions grow.

539
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:26,522
Oh, yes.

540
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,067
Daddy likes to affect the pretence
of being a dunce.

541
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:30,652
He is in fact a man of high intellect.

542
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:33,488
- He taught me how to read and write.
- Is that so?

543
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:38,201
- Education is an important thing.
- It is indeed, most important for everyone.

544
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:41,871
I myself am presently engaged
in the tutoring of my children.

545
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:43,539
That is indeed commendable.

546
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,917
It is a privilege
that was not afforded to me.

547
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:49,161
I am an uneducated,
self-taught Scotch woman.

548
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,465
Mrs Somerville, you are what you are.

549
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:54,467
- As are we, Daddy.
- True.

550
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,209
Thank you.

551
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,514
And what was your profession, Mr Turner?

552
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:01,891
Daddy was the finest barber
in Covent Garden.

553
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:04,269
I had some success in the business.

554
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:05,603
TURNER: Wig maker.

555
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,314
He was a master
of the razor and the brush.

556
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,441
You're the master of the brush now,
Mr Turner.

557
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,651
Well...

558
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:14,237
My little lad could draw
afore he could read and write.

559
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:17,481
Sat in the corner of the shop,
scratching away with the chalk and charcoal.

560
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:19,617
I'd stick his pictures in the window.

561
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:20,994
And sell 'em, all of 'em.

562
00:45:21,094 --> 00:45:23,445
For two or three shillings apiece
on occasion.

563
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,748
Do you have children
yourself, Mr Turner?

564
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:28,200
I do not, Mrs Somerville.

565
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,789
Thank you, Mr Turner.

566
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,927
- Have you ever seen a prism?
- I have not.

567
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:39,544
Ooh!

568
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,339
There it is.

569
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:46,561
That is a thing of beauty.

570
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:50,523
Shortly you shall witness
a rainbow passing through it.

571
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:53,693
- Sir Isaac Newton, Daddy.
- Ah!

572
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:57,697
Gentlemen, might I request
that you close the shutters, please?

573
00:45:57,797 --> 00:45:59,731
- Daddy.
- Ah!

574
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,153
Tell us when to cease, Mrs Somerville.

575
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:08,698
We need to create an aperture...

576
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:12,118
to strengthen the colours.

577
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,382
- MRS SOMERVILLE: There.
- Daddy!

578
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:19,761
- Aha!
- Let us put the paper in place.

579
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:23,514
- Daddy, some tacks for Mrs Somerville.
- No, no tacks, Mr Turner.

580
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,341
The metal could contaminate
the experiment.

581
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:30,345
A wee nub of wax.

582
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:36,560
Paper.

583
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,655
TURNER: And what is the purpose
of the small piece of paper?

584
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:45,578
I shall cover the bottom half of the needle
so that it is not exposed.

585
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:47,237
TURNER: Ah.

586
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,751
And what is it you are about now,
Mrs Somerville?

587
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:54,703
You'll have to wait and see, won't you?

588
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:01,344
Daddy, I wager that is the first time

589
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:03,805
you've witnessed a hammer
being produced from a lady's reticule.

590
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:05,714
For certain 'tis!

591
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,025
You have the arm of a blacksmith,
Mrs Somerville.

592
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:17,267
(LAUGHS)

593
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,605
There, now.

594
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:27,110
That has thrown
all those wee particles into chaos.

595
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:30,071
Particles into chaos.

596
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:34,502
What is the element contained
within the violet light

597
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,254
such as magnetises the material?

598
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:40,133
That is what, as yet, Mr Turner,
I do not know.

599
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:43,177
- Ah, the majesty of mystery.
- Indeed.

600
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,805
Now, let us allow nature
to take its course.

601
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:49,100
Although we will have to adjust
the position of the easel from time to time.

602
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,520
Indeed, as mighty Apollo moves
across his heavenly tract.

603
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,105
Yes!

604
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,732
- Three steps down, Mrs Somerville.
- Take care.

605
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:59,768
Oh, my goodness me!

606
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:03,030
Oh, Mr Turner, I am quite overwhelmed.

607
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,241
Do as you wish, view as you wish.

608
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:08,995
Oh, my!
These are breathtaking, are they not?

609
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:12,039
My dear late father
would have much appreciated them.

610
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:15,668
- A naval man, I believe.
- Indeed, he was a vice admiral.

611
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:19,046
- We have the Battle of Trafalgar over here.
- Was he there, your father?

612
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,748
- Er, no, he was at Camperdown.
- Ah.

613
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:25,261
- Lord Nelson's flagship, the Victory.
- Indeed.

614
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:28,181
- TURNER: It's a sketch for the painting.
- Oh?

615
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:30,516
- Commissioned by the King.
- Is that so?

616
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,643
Two years in the making.

617
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,229
- He didn't like it.
- Did he not?

618
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,689
- No.
- Too good for him.

619
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,649
(ALL LAUGH)

620
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,318
Two years!

621
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,862
It takes me only half an hour
to paint a picture.

622
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:44,697
So you are an artist, Mrs Somerville?

623
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:48,784
Oh, I don't think we can quite use that term
in the presence of Mr Turner.

624
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:52,079
Nevertheless, Daddy,
Mrs Somerville is a fine watercolourist.

625
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,916
Oh, you flatter me.
Oh, what an epic storm scene!

626
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:57,659
Rock crushing a house in Switzerland.

627
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:00,995
Calais sands, women digging for bait.

628
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:03,790
I don't care for that much.

629
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:07,669
Oh.

630
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,140
Oh, my! What have we here?

631
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,143
Oh, it's Hannibal crossing the Alps.

632
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:16,771
Do you see the elephant?

633
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:20,390
- An elephant?
- He's in there somewhere.

634
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:25,061
- Are you teasing me, Mr Turner?
- By no means, madam.

635
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,772
(CHUCKLES)

636
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,046
Can you find him?

637
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:44,581
Well, no, I cannot.

638
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:46,750
There he is.

639
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:50,846
- Oh! Ha, ha!
- Daddy's little jest.

640
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,307
(TURNER CHUCKLES)

641
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,602
Oh, it is a terrifying scene!

642
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:59,188
TURNER SNR: The elements
dwarfing the elephants.

643
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:00,889
TURNER: Hubris.

644
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,687
MRS SOMERVILLE: There.

645
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:11,274
Shall I make it do a wee dance?

646
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:15,538
So, the end of the needle
that was exposed to the violet light

647
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:17,415
has produced a magnetic north pole.

648
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,917
- Like a compass?
- Exactly so.

649
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,878
Whereas, Mr Turner,
had I done the same experiment

650
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:24,672
using the red end of the spectrum,

651
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:27,133
this needle would not
have been magnetised.

652
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:31,596
I have, from time to time, attempted it
with the green and the blue,

653
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:34,765
and it has succeeded on occasion
but not consistently.

654
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,175
Colour is contradictory.

655
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:41,147
Well, is it, Mr Turner?

656
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:42,648
Colour is absolute.

657
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:46,267
Sublime but contradictory
yet harmonious.

658
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,322
You are a man of great vision,
Mr Turner.

659
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:50,531
(GRUNTS)

660
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:54,192
The universe is chaotic
and you make us see it.

661
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:57,079
In natural philosophy

662
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:00,583
nothing can ever be proved,
only disproved.

663
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:03,878
The purity of your prism,
the contamination of my palette.

664
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:07,214
Natural light, blackness.

665
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:10,416
White is the power of good,
black is the devil.

666
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:14,212
Hm.

667
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:25,191
Transparent bodies depend so much
upon what is opposed to them,

668
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:27,068
having no colour,

669
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:29,519
that they take every one offered.

670
00:51:31,464 --> 00:51:32,772
Um...

671
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:38,496
Water often possesses colour

672
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:41,823
but colour is not imparted
to its reflections...

673
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:46,035
or refractions like a coloured glass

674
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:52,125
when everything seen
is vitiated by that colour.

675
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:57,973
Even the purest mirror
gives a tone to the sky

676
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:00,309
and as the colour is increased,

677
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:03,688
it destroys
all the colour of nature by its...

678
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:06,065
by its own dullness,

679
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:11,352
while water often seems
to challenge the sky for...

680
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:16,274
- ...brightness and...
- (COUGHING)

681
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:19,870
...and when possessing colour, um...

682
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:24,166
its reflections of objects
appear more possible.

683
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:28,119
In short, their effects
are like their qualities.

684
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:32,925
One repels the immediate ray.

685
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:34,885
- The other absorbs it.

I shall have the balsam prepared.

- Indeed I shall, sir.
- Good day, Mr Mallard.

Rest the body, sir,
and the soul shall find solace.

Let me show ye out.

My father and I are marvelling
at this glorious work.

Er... might I be correct in remembering

1044
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:13,522
that we had the good fortune of viewing it
at the Academy last summer?

1045
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:14,731
Indeed.

1046
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:18,861
Well, I must say, it is no less impressive
on its second viewing.

1047
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:21,905
Perhaps even more so. Is it not, Father?

1048
01:28:22,005 --> 01:28:23,198
Indeed so.

1049
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:26,451
I recall it provoked
much heated and stimulating discussion

1050
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:28,537
long after our viewing.

1051
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:31,415
- It did not sell.
- Indeed not?

1052
01:28:31,515 --> 01:28:33,500
No, Mr Ruskin.

1053
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,545
- I'm astonished.
- But it is a masterpiece.

1054
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:39,506
- Thackeray reviles it.
- How so?

1055
01:28:39,606 --> 01:28:43,176
- Sublime or ridiculous, he says.
- Well, perhaps he should make up his mind.

1056

He has a sharp and cynical tongue.

1057
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:48,348
There is no place for cynicism
in the reviewing of art.

contrasting with the scarlet and ochre hues
in the upper left corner,

1069
01:29:26,153 --> 01:29:29,598
which in turn contrasts
with the presence of God,

- Up in the muslin. Knock 'em out.

1074
01:29:43,462 --> 01:29:45,813
Well, I didn't put 'em there.

1075
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:53,705
Would it not sit splendidly
above the fireplace in the library, Father?

01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:57,542
It would, but I fear
it may be beyond our purse, John.

can be come to, sir.

- It is pitiable, Turner.

1202
01:39:10,069 --> 01:39:12,003
You have never had to endure
the loss of a child.

1203
01:39:13,781 --> 01:39:14,891
I have not, sir.

1204
01:39:14,991 --> 01:39:16,893
A dying child,

1205
01:39:16,993 --> 01:39:19,678
'tis a potent subject
for a painting, is it not?

1206
01:39:21,456 --> 01:39:23,858
And what is your
present endeavour, Turner?

1207
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:27,894
- Er... marine piece.
- A marine piece?

1208
01:39:29,213 --> 01:39:31,773
Do not you tire of boats
and the fiery firmament?

1209
01:39:32,467 --> 01:39:33,984
I do not, sir.

1210
01:39:35,845 --> 01:39:38,331
Sometimes I consider
it might make a better course for me

1211
01:39:38,431 --> 01:39:40,532
were I to set light to the house

1212
01:39:41,517 --> 01:39:45,547
with my wife, my surviving children
and myself within it.

1213
01:39:45,647 --> 01:39:47,914
Then they would no longer
be saddled with me.

1214
01:39:48,149 --> 01:39:52,085
Your pain is your own, sir.
Do not inflict it upon your loved ones.

1215
01:39:54,447 --> 01:39:56,423
Will you take my ten pounds?

1216
01:39:58,493 --> 01:40:01,813
I will not, sir.
You are free of your debt.

1217
01:40:01,913 --> 01:40:04,440
- Free? How so?
- 'Tis expunged.

1218
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:07,569
Er... no, sir. I do not come here
a seeker after charity or pity.

1219

You have neither charity
nor pity nor debt.

1220
01:40:10,129 --> 01:40:12,031
I do not wish it in such a circumstance.

1221
01:40:12,131 --> 01:40:15,243

the gentleman into the street.

01:40:27,146 --> 01:40:28,298

- Mr Ruskin!

1230

01:40:56,592 --> 01:40:59,662
I do indeed, thank you.
Pride of place, Mr Turner.

was built around it.

1236
01:41:03,349 --> 01:41:05,951
- Please, come through.
- Jonesy.

1237
01:41:10,273 --> 01:41:11,883
Er, my good husband is of the opinion

1238
01:41:11,983 --> 01:41:15,303
that the gooseberry
prefers the colder climate,

1239
01:41:15,403 --> 01:41:18,890
whereas I consider
that all fruits benefit from the warmth.

1240
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:23,353
My dear late mother always insisted
that both the gooseberry and the rhubarb

1241
01:41:23,453 --> 01:41:26,314
favour the colder climes
of our victorious isles.

1242
01:41:26,414 --> 01:41:31,059
I do not doubt that the gooseberry
for its preference may enjoy the warm,

1243
01:41:31,586 --> 01:41:36,282
however I am convinced that a cold start
promotes the more vigorous specimen.

1244
01:41:36,382 --> 01:41:38,826
Are we not to take as empirical evidence

1245
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:43,122
our many expeditions to the warmer
climes of the Mediterranean

1246
01:41:43,222 --> 01:41:46,876
where we do not exactly encounter
an abundance of gooseberries?

1247
01:41:46,976 --> 01:41:49,629
- Ha! Indeed.
- ROBERTS: Exactly so.

1248
01:41:49,729 --> 01:41:52,006
I did not myself savour
many gooseberries in Jerusalem.

1249
01:41:52,106 --> 01:41:54,759
Ah, the holy city, Mr Turner.

1250
01:41:54,859 --> 01:41:58,221
ROBERTS: And yet we do enjoy
fine gooseberries in Scotland,

1251
01:41:58,321 --> 01:41:59,514
do we not, Mr Ruskin?

1252
01:41:59,614 --> 01:42:02,591
Aye, and no better a cold start
than a good Scottish sun.

1253
01:42:03,618 --> 01:42:04,811
Exactly that.

1254
01:42:04,911 --> 01:42:09,524
Surely, regardless of how cold the start
of the life of the gooseberry might be,

1255
01:42:09,624 --> 01:42:12,485
it is almost certainly destined
for a warm ending.

1256
01:42:12,585 --> 01:42:16,698
To which we have all borne witness
in Mrs Ruskin's excellent gooseberry pie.

May I propose as a topic for discussion

1259
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:27,166
the question as to the depiction
of the seas and the oceans

1260
01:42:27,266 --> 01:42:28,793
in pictorial art?

1263
01:42:33,189 --> 01:42:37,719
to be in the presence of two of our
most distinguished marine painters,

1264
01:42:37,819 --> 01:42:41,180
Mr Turner and Mr Stanfield,

1265
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:45,560
not to forget Captain Jones
and Mr Roberts, of course,

1266
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:50,314
whose realisations are confined
to mere naked terra firma,

1267
01:42:50,414 --> 01:42:52,066
exemplary though they are.

1268
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:53,266
(GRUNTS)

1269
01:42:54,168 --> 01:42:56,863
My point being that, alas,

1270
01:42:56,963 --> 01:43:01,743
I find myself harbouring
a perhaps rather controversial opinion

1271
01:43:01,843 --> 01:43:04,162
regarding the long deceased Claude.

1272
01:43:04,262 --> 01:43:08,166
- Indeed?
- I am afraid so, Captain Jones.

1273
01:43:08,266 --> 01:43:10,168
I must confess

1274
01:43:10,268 --> 01:43:16,048
that I find his rendering of the sea
rather insipid, dull and uninspiring.

1275
01:43:16,148 --> 01:43:18,968
That is an extremely bold statement,
young Mr Ruskin.

1276
01:43:19,068 --> 01:43:20,720
Thank you very much.

1277
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:22,722
Claude was a man of his time.

1278
01:43:22,822 --> 01:43:25,141
My point exactly, Mr Turner,

1279
01:43:25,241 --> 01:43:27,769
but that time is now long past.

1280
01:43:27,869 --> 01:43:31,606
When I experience
a modern masterpiece such as yours,

1281
01:43:31,706 --> 01:43:35,860
I am struck by the clarity
with which you have captured the moment.

1282
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:38,279
Take, for example, your slave ship,

1283
01:43:38,379 --> 01:43:42,617
"Slavers Throwing Overboard
the Dead and Dying - Typhoon Coming On",

1284
01:43:42,717 --> 01:43:45,578
by which I have the good fortune
to be greeted every morning

1285
01:43:45,678 --> 01:43:48,039
on my way into my meagre breakfast.

1286
01:43:48,139 --> 01:43:52,627
The impact of the foaming
brine incarnadine

1287
01:43:52,727 --> 01:43:56,672
consuming those unfortunate Negro slaves

1288
01:43:56,772 --> 01:44:00,635
never ceases to quicken
the beat of my heart.

1289
01:44:00,735 --> 01:44:04,555
Yet when I gaze upon a work of Claude

1290
01:44:04,655 --> 01:44:06,891
I find myself enduring nothing more

1291
01:44:06,991 --> 01:44:10,186
than a mere collection
of precise brushstrokes

1292
01:44:10,286 --> 01:44:13,356
which instil in me
no sense of awe whatsoever,

1293
01:44:13,456 --> 01:44:14,899
let alone the sea.

1294
01:44:14,999 --> 01:44:16,599
Preposterous!

1295
01:44:16,959 --> 01:44:19,644
I do beg your pardon, Mrs Ruskin.

1296
01:44:21,589 --> 01:44:24,033
- Claude Lorrain was a genius.
- Quite so.

1297
01:44:24,133 --> 01:44:28,454
I sense an excess of modesty in Mr Turner
and there is no need for such humility.

1298
01:44:28,554 --> 01:44:30,414
Mr Ruskin, sir,

1299
01:44:30,514 --> 01:44:35,628
to conjecture upon the matter
of seascape painting is one thing

1300
01:44:35,728 --> 01:44:38,381
but to stand amongst the elements

1301
01:44:38,481 --> 01:44:43,594
and to experience
and to interpret what one sees

1302
01:44:43,694 --> 01:44:45,137
is something quite other.

1303
01:44:45,237 --> 01:44:47,014
- Hear, hear.
- Quite.

1304
01:44:47,114 --> 01:44:48,641
That is as it may be.

1305
01:44:48,741 --> 01:44:53,145
Claude painted from the land,
looking at the sea becalmed by the harbour.

1306
01:44:53,245 --> 01:44:55,930
- Oh, indeed.
- "Bless the Lord, oh my soul

1307
01:44:56,958 --> 01:44:59,652
"Who layeth the beams
of his chambers in the waters

1308

1309
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:03,906

1310
01:45:04,006 --> 01:45:05,324
Thank you, John.

1311

1312

1313
01:45:10,137 --> 01:45:12,331
he was overheard to remark that...

1314
01:45:12,431 --> 01:45:15,710
"waves of sea are indeed lovely to watch

01:45:20,690 --> 01:45:22,457
- For a second.
- "...a second."

1318
01:45:24,402 --> 01:45:28,014
I find myself marvelling
at my own wealth of perception,

1319
01:45:28,114 --> 01:45:30,131

01:45:30,616 --> 01:45:31,851

a somewhat conundrous question?

with a question?

Why, certainly, sir.

1552
02:02:36,975 --> 02:02:38,877

with your contraption?

1553
02:02:38,977 --> 02:02:41,963
- I do, sir, from time to time.
- Such as what?

1554
02:02:42,063 --> 02:02:45,207
Why, I have recorded
the great falls of Niagara, sir.

1555
02:02:46,151 --> 02:02:48,762
- The Niagara Falls?
- Indeed, sir.

1556
02:02:48,862 --> 02:02:51,014
The greatest wonder in nature.

1557
02:02:51,114 --> 02:02:54,883
It was there that I was once able
to capture a rainbow.

1558
02:02:56,453 --> 02:02:58,470

1559
02:02:59,497 --> 02:03:01,431

1560
02:03:02,042 --> 02:03:05,779

that I have long desired to witness.

1561

02:03:07,630 --> 02:03:11,326
Now, madam, sir,
if I may ask you to fix your gaze here

1563
02:03:11,426 --> 02:03:13,411

is written with a Gillott pen nib,

I enjoy my wealth.

1598
02:05:31,900 --> 02:05:35,127
Two things delight me in my life:

1599
02:05:35,904 --> 02:05:38,681
fashioning a nib from steel
and making money,

1600
02:05:38,781 --> 02:05:42,185
and I like to spend my money
on things that give me pleasure.

1601
02:05:42,285 --> 02:05:45,396
And your pictures give me much pleasure.

1602
02:05:45,496 --> 02:05:47,941
I want them, all of them.

And what will the British nation
pay you?

02:06:13,816 --> 02:06:16,761
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
