you let me install this on it.

334
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,745
- Please just let me test it.
- No. No, I'm sorry, Deon.

335
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,135
You know how insurance works for those,

336
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,984
all the red tape
and the paperwork.

337
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,446
- Thank you for your time.
- Mm-hm.

Hey.
Hey, hey, hey...!

Please!
Hey, what is it?

353
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,669
This is you getting hijacked,
my friend.

354
00:20:18,694 --> 00:20:20,105
Welcome to Joburg.

355
00:20:23,308 --> 00:20:26,979
And these are all part
of what makes the moose unique

356
00:20:27,004 --> 00:20:29,355
And I think perfect for you
at the police department.

357
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,605
The strategic ability to be able to
neutralize the enemy's targets.

358
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,650
High-value targets:
Radar installations,

359
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:37,959
aircraft,
fuel storage locations.

360
00:20:37,984 --> 00:20:39,704
Aircraft?
Yes, sir.

361
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,376
[All chuckling]

362
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:43,845
We're taking out
an enemy's aircraft?

363
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,741
We are talking
about urban crimes here?

364
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:49,022
You know, muggings,
carjackings, loitering.

365
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,788
I'm talking all kinds
of targets, sir. Low to high.

366
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:54,298
I do believe you need
a weapons platform

367
00:20:54,323 --> 00:20:57,608
that can fire high explosive warheads
with precision and reliability.

368
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,464
And might I add, sir, all under
the control of a human operator.

369
00:21:02,382 --> 00:21:03,867
Look, Miss Bradley,

370
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:06,310
The police force is very happy
with the scouts.

371
00:21:06,335 --> 00:21:07,697
Very, very happy.

372
00:21:07,722 --> 00:21:09,918
- We just ordered new droids.
- Thank you.

373
00:21:09,943 --> 00:21:13,278
And we've been very successful
at bringing down the crime rate.

374
00:21:13,303 --> 00:21:15,341
But this?
No, we don't want this.

375
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:16,816
I mean, look at it.
It's overkill.

376
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:19,786
It's expensive,
it's big, and it's ugly.

377
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:22,045
It'll have to get a hell
of a lot worse...

378
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,888
... for us to even consider this.

379
00:21:24,913 --> 00:21:26,719
A hell of a lot worse.

380
00:21:27,064 --> 00:21:28,872
No, I think we're done here.

381
00:21:28,897 --> 00:21:31,678
Michelle: Well, thank you,
Commissioner Steenkamp.

382
00:21:31,703 --> 00:21:33,691
We'll get you those scouts.

Please, I don't have much money.

00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,529
Shut up.
I don't want your money.

387
00:22:06,554 --> 00:22:10,377
- We know who you are, my friend.
- We know you make the robots.

388
00:22:10,402 --> 00:22:12,929
No, there must be a mistake.

Stop playing dumb
with us!

391
00:22:16,563 --> 00:22:19,592
Yo. We know you clowns
have some kind of TV remote thing

392
00:22:19,617 --> 00:22:21,273
to switch those robots off.

393
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,591
Excuse me?

394
00:22:22,616 --> 00:22:25,159
It's a machine.
It's got an on-off switch.

395
00:22:25,184 --> 00:22:28,129
- Maybe there's a remote in the Van.
- <i> Ja,</i> check the Van. Amerika.

396
00:22:28,154 --> 00:22:30,147
- Amerika: Cut his feet off.
- Ninja: That's a good idea.

397
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:33,539
No, no, no!
No, please! Help!

398
00:22:33,564 --> 00:22:35,248
Yo, man, that's a good idea.
We'll cut your feet off.

399
00:22:35,273 --> 00:22:37,419
And you can just get yourself
a nice, funky wheelchair.

400

No, please, please. Just listen.
You cannot switch them off.

401
00:22:40,074 --> 00:22:41,515
Bullshit!
It's a machine.

402
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,270
They are designed with a firmware lock.

There's legs and shit
all over the place.

00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:04,210
Was he gonna build it
or something?

00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,043
You know what?

411
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:09,920
What if we get him to program
this bad boy to fight for us?

412
00:23:09,945 --> 00:23:13,826
Like an indestructible robot gangsta.
Number one, son.

413

Hey.

00:23:15,737 --> 00:23:18,867
Listen, my friend, we know
about your little buddy at...

415
00:23:18,892 --> 00:23:20,682
... at the back of the van you're
trying to hide from us.

416
00:23:20,707 --> 00:23:22,242
I wasn't hiding anything.

417
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:26,424
Either you reprogram that robot
in the Van to work for us,v

418
00:23:26,449 --> 00:23:28,419
or we fucking
shoot you right now.

419
00:23:28,444 --> 00:23:30,444
What do you mean exactly,
"reprogram him"?

420
00:23:30,469 --> 00:23:33,403
- Yo-Landi: Don't play dumb!
- Dude. You know exactly what we mean.

421
00:23:33,428 --> 00:23:36,410
You turn that robot into
the illest gangsta on the block.

422
00:23:36,435 --> 00:23:39,611
We use him to make some moves
and make some real money.

423

The one in my van is a test.

It's never been tried,
but if it works, you can...

425
00:23:47,222 --> 00:23:49,471
You can train him to do what you want.
I swear.

426
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:51,343
What do you mean,
"if it works"?

427
00:23:51,368 --> 00:23:53,423
It's a new project
I'm working on.

428
00:23:53,448 --> 00:23:55,902
It makes the robot have a mind
like a human.

429
00:23:55,998 --> 00:23:58,275
But it's like a child
in the beginning.

430
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,616
Like a human baby,
but smarter.

431
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:03,887
It's AI is capable of learning much faster
than any organic intelligence.

432
00:24:03,912 --> 00:24:06,023
- But it would have to be taught.
- Well, how long would that take?

00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:07,728
I said I don't know!
It's untested.

Alright, enough of this.

Look! This is your only option!
I created them and I'm telling you:

436
00:24:11,907 --> 00:24:15,295
You cannot switch them off
and you cannot hack the other ones.

I don't wanna die.

00:24:36,877 --> 00:24:38,557
It was scheduled
for destruction.

- Ninja: Why?
- Because it's damaged.

443
00:24:40,972 --> 00:24:42,990
The battery is fused with the shanty.

444
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,273
What?

445
00:24:45,272 --> 00:24:47,426
It means you can't change
the battery.

446
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:49,070
Why they how long will it last?

447
00:24:49,095 --> 00:24:50,422
- Shit.
- Ha-ha-ha. Oh, shit.

448
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,682
Approximately five days,
until the battery dies.

449
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:55,541
And you say this thing will only
run for five days?

450
00:24:55,566 --> 00:24:57,101
Roughly, yes.

- Deon: It's a guard key.

452

I have to come back
and help to teach it.

456
00:25:26,763 --> 00:25:28,556
Otherwise, this is pointless.

Just switch it on.
