[Sister Ruth] Detective Kimble.

182
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:19,308
Please, find our girls.

183
00:13:19,342 --> 00:13:20,343
I will.

184
00:13:22,311 --> 00:13:25,482
Oh, things we do
before we find our calling.

185
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:28,918
Thank you, Sister Ruth.

186
00:13:28,951 --> 00:13:30,254
Oh, what about security?

187
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:32,557
[Sister Ruth] Security?

188
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,424
Besides the lockdown timer?

189
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:37,227
- Lockdown timer?
- Yes.

190
00:13:37,261 --> 00:13:39,096
Each night
the lockdown timer is on

191
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:41,533
from 10:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m.
the next morning.

192
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:44,235
Great, can I speak with the
security patrol that handles that?

193
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:46,804
You're looking at her.

194
00:13:46,838 --> 00:13:50,208
And there is no
so-called security patrol.

195
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:51,477
Just the timer switch.

196
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,580
- Wait...
- I'm afraid that's all we have.

197
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:57,816
So, you don't have security guards
of any kind patrolling the grounds?!

198
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,418
Absolutely not.

199
00:13:59,452 --> 00:14:01,387
That completely goes against
what we stand for.

200
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,055
Some of these girls
have criminal records.

201
00:14:03,088 --> 00:14:06,126
You are absolutely right,
Detective.

202
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:08,496
And those same girls
have already served their time.

203
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:12,832
They come here to heal
and to be trusted once more

204
00:14:12,866 --> 00:14:14,334
before we let them
back out in society.

205
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:16,036
I know the type
who usually ends up here,

206
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:17,003
they're still societies worst.

207
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:20,441
St. Matthias,
we have never had armed guards,

208
00:14:20,475 --> 00:14:22,977
or security patrol,
or whatever you say it is

209
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,211
that we need to have
on our grounds.

210
00:14:24,245 --> 00:14:28,483
Our program has worked wonders
since 1914.

211
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:30,952
Ever since
we opened the doors.

212
00:14:35,924 --> 00:14:38,327
Father, Detective.

213
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:43,467
- [Father Peter] Sister, could you do me a favor...
- Yes?

214
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,401
...and please make sure
that that box sees upstairs?

215
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:47,270
Yes, of course.

216
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,473
I'll make sure
one of the girls retrieves it.

217
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:50,541
Thank you.

218
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:03,287
[exhales]
Nineteen-fourteen.

219
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,988
Didn't know this place
was around then.

220
00:15:05,022 --> 00:15:10,895
Yeah, yeah, the history
of this place is just...

221
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:13,566
I swear, you just feel it
in the walls, you know.

222
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:19,205
As a matter of fact, Father Thomas
who actually founded our organization,

223
00:15:19,238 --> 00:15:21,641
he took his motivation
from another mission

224
00:15:21,675 --> 00:15:24,210
that he had been
a part of in San Diego.

225
00:15:24,243 --> 00:15:27,046
They say that we get the motivation
for, uh, for our bell tower.

226
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:28,447
I didn't know that.

227
00:15:31,552 --> 00:15:33,320
Look at you.

228
00:15:33,353 --> 00:15:35,590
- Can you help me with these?
- Yeah.

229
00:15:35,623 --> 00:15:38,559
Have you seen the detective?
He's cute.

230
00:15:38,593 --> 00:15:40,227
Meh, not my type.

231
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,363
Ladies,
have you seen Sister Ruth?

232
00:15:42,397 --> 00:15:44,232
I think she went to go see
Sister Francis.

233
00:15:44,265 --> 00:15:45,266
Thank you.

234
00:15:48,336 --> 00:15:50,238
Sister Ruth...

235
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,242
[medical monitor beeping]

236
00:15:56,111 --> 00:15:58,380
[sighs]
What's a matter with you, Nikki?

237
00:15:58,414 --> 00:16:01,150
Okay...
[clears throat]

238
00:16:01,183 --> 00:16:03,318
I'm sorry, Sister Francis, um,

239
00:16:03,352 --> 00:16:06,657
I forgot your dish and glass.

240
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:18,703
[yelps]

241
00:16:19,704 --> 00:16:21,238
Sister Ruth, I'm...

242
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,407
I'm-I'm sorry.

243
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,544
You startled me and...

244
00:16:41,427 --> 00:16:43,329
[glass clinking]

245
00:17:11,694 --> 00:17:15,464
Um, so 16 including
Montgomery and Nolan?

246
00:17:15,498 --> 00:17:17,767
- Uh...
- Excuse me, Father.

247
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:20,402
Uh, Sister Ruth
sent me to grab a box?

248
00:17:21,437 --> 00:17:22,472
There.

249
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:33,316
Thank you, Kacy.

250
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,487
Uh, no, I believe it's
nine or ten at the moment.

251
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:43,327
- Yummy.
- [Father Peter] We had a few girls that, uh,

252
00:17:43,361 --> 00:17:46,063
that finished the program and
then a few that ran away, so...

253
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:47,398
More runaways?

254
00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:49,801
No. No, no, no,
Just-just the two.

255
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,441
Is this true? Both girls are now
set for an earlier release date

256
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:57,844
than they were
originally sentenced?

257
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:01,179
Yes, uh, both girls
were showing great promise.

258
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,415
So we made them a part
of our Big Sister program

259
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:05,118
which made the eligible
for early release.

260
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,152
- What's that?
- What's what?

261
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,822
- Big Sister program.
- Uh, it is a program

262
00:18:08,856 --> 00:18:11,357
that we invented
several years ago where

263
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,727
it allowed for some of
the best and brightest

264
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:18,232
to further their own rehabilitation
by helping other girls.

265
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:19,400
It's one of the things
we're able to do here

266
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:22,336
with, uh, such small numbers
in our family atmosphere.

267
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:24,438
If they were doing so well
what triggered them to run?

268
00:18:24,472 --> 00:18:26,641
I, uh, I would imagine
you'll have to

269
00:18:26,675 --> 00:18:29,110
ask them that yourself
when you find them, Detective.

270
00:18:29,144 --> 00:18:33,516
- [scoffs]
- Uh, we have a very, very busy day going on here,

271
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:36,418
and I believe I've given you
everything I possibly can so,

272
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:38,554
please, excuse me,
I have to get to a group session now.

273
00:18:38,588 --> 00:18:40,656
What about Trina Mathews?

274
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,892
What about Trina Mathews?

275
00:18:41,925 --> 00:18:43,594
Did you know her?

276
00:18:43,627 --> 00:18:45,328
No, I saw her name on the box.

277
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:48,799
Oh! [chuckles]
Yeah, um...

278
00:18:48,832 --> 00:18:52,134
Uh, she was one of the girls that,
uh, recently finished our program.

279
00:18:52,168 --> 00:18:54,371
Great. Great.
Good for her.

280
00:18:54,404 --> 00:18:56,908
I applaud anyone who gets their shit
together and changes their life.

281
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:59,242
- Bravo to you guys.
- Thank you.

282
00:18:59,276 --> 00:19:00,912
Mm-hm. Oh, one last thing,

283
00:19:00,945 --> 00:19:02,013
I didn't see
any last residence

284
00:19:02,046 --> 00:19:04,515
or even the last employment
for Alissa Montgomery.

285
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:07,151
- Nolan.
- Huh?

286
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:08,453
- Alissa Nolan.
- Oh.

287
00:19:08,487 --> 00:19:10,388
Yeah, Alissa Nolan,
Karla Montgomery.

288
00:19:10,421 --> 00:19:13,659
Um, Miss Nolan used to
bounce around a lot.

289
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:16,662
I believe the only thing
that we had on her

290
00:19:16,695 --> 00:19:21,735
was that she used to periodically
work at some biker bar in Levittown?

291
00:19:21,768 --> 00:19:24,904
Anyway, Detective,
please, excuse me.

292
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,581
I pray to God that you bring our
girls back safe and sound soon.

293
00:19:33,614 --> 00:19:35,583

00:49:56,723 --> 00:49:58,691
You wanna tell me
where Montgomery is?

709
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:00,860
She's not with me.

710
00:50:00,893 --> 00:50:03,529
Well, no shit.
That I can see, genius.

711
00:50:03,563 --> 00:50:05,565
Where is she at?

712
00:50:05,598 --> 00:50:08,534
- She's dead.
- You're full of shit.

713
00:50:09,602 --> 00:50:11,404
- She is dead.
- Shut up.

714
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:17,679
Why the gun?

715
00:50:19,313 --> 00:50:20,547
Who's after you?

716
00:50:21,415 --> 00:50:23,384
Not who, more like what.

717
00:50:23,417 --> 00:50:25,419
So you bought a gun
off these guys for what?

718
00:50:26,921 --> 00:50:29,391
I'm gonna ask you again,
where is Karla Montgomery?

719
00:50:29,424 --> 00:50:31,593
I told you, she's dead.

720
00:50:31,626 --> 00:50:33,528
She never made it
out of the building with me.

721
00:50:34,797 --> 00:50:36,297
Something took her.

722
00:50:37,432 --> 00:50:39,368
- Something...
- Who did?

723
00:50:39,402 --> 00:50:42,639
- Something, an animal.
- [scoffs] Animal?

724
00:50:42,673 --> 00:50:44,540
At the half way house?
You too, huh?

725
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:48,645
It's not a good place.

726
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:52,750
People go missing,
people die every month.

727
00:50:52,784 --> 00:50:53,918
Yeah, I heard.

728
00:50:57,855 --> 00:50:59,589
Silver bullets?

729
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:02,426
You got a werewolf problem
at this church?

730
00:51:13,337 --> 00:51:14,372
What?

731
00:51:16,542 --> 00:51:17,711
Huh.

732
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,888
Eww.

733
00:51:29,824 --> 00:51:31,659
No wonder that biker
called you a gypsy.

734
00:51:31,692 --> 00:51:32,860
Is this the story?

735
00:51:34,662 --> 00:51:37,865
I was planning to head back
and kill it.

736
00:51:37,898 --> 00:51:39,701
- Kill what?
- The thing.

737
00:51:39,735 --> 00:51:41,737
I'm sure it will bleed out
with a few of those.

738
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:43,839
Anything will bleed out
when you shoot it.

739
00:51:45,774 --> 00:51:47,374
Maybe it is a wolf.

740
00:51:47,408 --> 00:51:49,044
Maybe it's
the only logical explanation.

741
00:51:49,077 --> 00:51:51,681
People... people disappear every
month during the full moon.

742
00:51:51,714 --> 00:51:53,448
Are you high?

743
00:51:53,482 --> 00:51:55,517
A freakin werewolf, c'mon!

744
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,455
Look, I don't know what it was,

745
00:52:00,489 --> 00:52:03,292
but I saw it kill Karla
and God knows who else.

746
00:52:03,326 --> 00:52:04,862
It must have killed
many of the girls.

747
00:52:04,895 --> 00:52:06,529
You know how nuts this sounds?

748
00:52:10,633 --> 00:52:12,970
The priest and nun said
that you were a role model.

749
00:52:14,537 --> 00:52:16,808
So you wanna tell me
why you really ran away?

750
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:19,443
No one ever gets away.

751
00:52:21,578 --> 00:52:22,680
They get you.

752
00:52:23,948 --> 00:52:26,517
- One by one.
- Yeah.

753
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:29,922
Redheaded girl at your house
said the same thing.

754
00:52:29,955 --> 00:52:32,825
Look, I'm sure people left
that place without incident.

755
00:52:33,491 --> 00:52:34,559
[groans]

756
00:52:35,895 --> 00:52:37,897
Say I believe you.

757
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:41,835
Why would they report you and
Karla as runaways to the police?

758
00:52:41,868 --> 00:52:43,770
How else can they get away
with what they're doing?

759
00:52:43,804 --> 00:52:45,504
They have to say something.

760
00:52:45,538 --> 00:52:47,674
They call you guys,
you come look for us,

761
00:52:47,707 --> 00:52:48,775
can't find us, case closed.

762
00:52:48,809 --> 00:52:51,913
No one gives a shit
about runaways in the system.

763
00:52:51,946 --> 00:52:54,015
Something ate my friend!

764
00:53:04,993 --> 00:53:07,495
Uh, this is Rosita's shirt

765
00:53:11,667 --> 00:53:12,835
[gasps]

766
00:53:14,136 --> 00:53:16,405
[growling]

767
00:53:20,609 --> 00:53:21,978
- [screaming]
- [growling]

768
00:53:23,512 --> 00:53:24,914
Okay, so you're saying...

769
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:29,586
people disappear from this place
all the time

770
00:53:29,619 --> 00:53:32,622
- and nobody knows about it.
- Some do.

771
00:53:32,656 --> 00:53:35,558
And the nun and the priest
that I met are in on it.

772
00:53:35,592 --> 00:53:38,062
- That's your story?
- I heard that Father Peter isn't a real priest,

773
00:53:38,095 --> 00:53:39,164
he's protecting
whatever is in the...

774
00:53:39,197 --> 00:53:41,800
- For shit's sake...
- I watched Karla get killed!

775
00:53:46,503 --> 00:53:48,139
[crying]

776
00:53:48,173 --> 00:53:49,473
- <i>She reached out with her bag.</i>
- [screaming]

777
00:53:54,579 --> 00:53:56,514
I saw this thing...

778
00:53:58,684 --> 00:54:00,485
come out of the darkness...

779
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:05,591
and freaking chomped down
on her arm!

780
00:54:12,733 --> 00:54:15,502
And it dragged her away.

781
00:54:23,912 --> 00:54:26,513
You saw this?

782
00:54:26,546 --> 00:54:28,684
Oh, my God, have you not
been listening to me?

783
00:54:28,717 --> 00:54:32,620
Hey, kid, look, I don't know what
goes on over in that place, okay.

784
00:54:32,655 --> 00:54:37,893
Obviously, something scared you
bad enough for you to run away,

785
00:54:37,927 --> 00:54:40,130
and to buy a gun
with plans to use it.

786
00:54:42,732 --> 00:54:44,000
You believe me now?

787
00:54:44,034 --> 00:54:45,434
[Robbie] <i>Kid...</i>

788
00:54:51,008 --> 00:54:52,009
Look, I'll tell you what...

789
00:54:53,177 --> 00:54:56,113
- [sniffling]
- When I take you back,

790
00:54:56,147 --> 00:54:59,516
you and I will go on
a tour of that place.

791
00:54:59,549 --> 00:55:00,818
We'll figure shit out.

792
00:55:00,851 --> 00:55:02,153
Okay?

793
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,928
Thank you.

794
00:55:16,235 --> 00:55:17,870
What you'd say your name was?

795
00:55:17,904 --> 00:55:19,205
Robbie Kimble.

796
00:55:23,676 --> 00:55:25,144
Nice to meet you, Robbie.

797
00:55:29,984 --> 00:55:31,651
I am Alissa Nolan.

798
00:55:34,054 --> 00:55:35,723
Nice to meet you, Alissa.

799
00:55:38,058 --> 00:55:39,928
[engine starts]

800
00:55:48,336 --> 00:55:51,907
[chuckles] It's just me.
I forgot my snack.

801
00:55:56,112 --> 00:55:58,080
No, I'm good.

802
00:55:58,114 --> 00:55:59,782
All right, well,
I'm going back downstairs

803
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:01,649
to play the game,
are you coming?

804
00:56:01,684 --> 00:56:03,253
Nah, I think
I'm gonna do some reading

805
00:56:03,286 --> 00:56:04,855
and call it a night.

806
00:56:04,888 --> 00:56:05,989
Okay.

807
00:56:06,023 --> 00:56:07,891
Suit yourself, Sister.

808
00:56:08,692 --> 00:56:09,826
- Later.
- Later.

809
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,634
What now?

810
00:56:17,668 --> 00:56:20,772
[scoffs]
What are you doing in here?

811
00:56:20,805 --> 00:56:24,142
I thought you were taking Sister
Francis her dinner this evening?

812
00:56:25,276 --> 00:56:26,677
Uh, yeah...
[stutters]

813
00:56:26,711 --> 00:56:29,281
Iris wanted to do it,
so I-I let her do it.

814
00:56:29,314 --> 00:56:31,016
[sighs softly]

815
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:32,684
[Mandi]
Everything okay?

816
00:56:32,718 --> 00:56:34,253
Yes!

817
00:56:34,286 --> 00:56:35,854
Have you seen Father Michael?

818
00:56:35,888 --> 00:56:38,290
He never made it
down to the game.

819
00:56:38,323 --> 00:56:39,893
Well, he's not here.

820
00:56:40,927 --> 00:56:41,995
I can see that.

821
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:45,265
[sighs]
All right, Michael,

822
00:56:45,298 --> 00:56:47,566
come out from under there,
she caught us.

823
00:56:48,768 --> 00:56:50,871
I fail to see
the humor in that.

824
00:56:50,905 --> 00:56:52,206
I thought it was funny.

825
00:56:54,175 --> 00:56:55,176
Sister Ruth...

826
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:57,644
I was wondering, um...

827
00:56:59,113 --> 00:57:01,048
do you happen to know where
Nikki or Rosita are?

828
00:57:01,082 --> 00:57:03,785
Just never saw them
at dinner tonight.

829
00:57:03,819 --> 00:57:05,287
Yes.

830
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,355
They went to the store
with Father Peter.

831
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:16,833
[girls laughing]

832
00:57:23,906 --> 00:57:25,808
[indistinct chatter]

833
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:33,917
[muttering]

834
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:42,026
Hey, if you're a priest,
why you wearing a wedding band?

835
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:45,196
Well, priests and all nuns
are married to God.

836
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:47,398
Whoa, that's weird.
[chuckles]

837
00:57:47,432 --> 00:57:49,666
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah, interesting.

838
00:57:51,403 --> 00:57:52,371
I'm out.

839
00:57:52,404 --> 00:57:53,939
- [groans]
- What?

840
00:57:53,973 --> 00:57:56,675
You can't quit after you win,
that sucks.

841
00:57:56,709 --> 00:57:58,878
My father
didn't raise no fool.

842
00:57:58,911 --> 00:58:00,846
[all chuckle]

843
00:58:08,855 --> 00:58:10,190
- [upbeat music playing]
- Ooh!

844
00:58:10,223 --> 00:58:12,425
- Whoo, girl.
- All right!

845
00:58:12,459 --> 00:58:14,962
- We're gonna have some fun.
- [indistinct chatter]

846
00:58:14,996 --> 00:58:19,267
- Yeah, get it, girl.
- Whoo, shake it.

847
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,736
- Okay, strip...
- Whoo!

848
00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:24,205
Whoo! Whoo!

849
00:58:24,238 --> 00:58:28,076
- Bring it over here, Sister.
- Whoo!

850
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,483
- All right!
- Yeah, yeah!

851
00:58:34,516 --> 00:58:36,285
[all laughing]

852
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:38,420
Four dollars?

853
00:58:38,453 --> 00:58:40,356
Is that really
all I'm worth to you?

854
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:43,092
- Bitch, you're lucky I had that.
- [all laughing]

855
00:58:43,126 --> 00:58:45,361
Aww, Sara, come over here
and dance for me, girl.

856
00:58:45,395 --> 00:58:48,231
- I got a ten spot for you.
- Oww!

857
00:58:48,264 --> 00:58:51,001
That song. Oh, yeah,
that's my jam right there.

858
00:58:51,035 --> 00:58:53,137
- Yes ma'am.
- Yeah, let's do it.

859
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:55,172
- Yes!
- [laughing]

860
00:59:00,077 --> 00:59:01,378
Hey, can we play again?

861
00:59:02,446 --> 00:59:03,982
Leave me alone.

862
00:59:04,015 --> 00:59:05,350
I don't even know
why you're down here.

863
00:59:05,383 --> 00:59:06,384
Nobody likes you ass.

864
00:59:07,852 --> 00:59:09,387
[Father Michael]
Ladies...

865
00:59:10,288 --> 00:59:11,389
Don't say that to her.

866
00:59:12,891 --> 00:59:14,226
I'm sure they're just kidding.

867
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,995
Yo, Father New Guy...

868
00:59:16,028 --> 00:59:18,297
- She's not that bad...
- ...don't put words in my mouth.

869
00:59:18,331 --> 00:59:20,866
You don't know her,
she's crazy.

870
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:24,070
It's Father Michael,
not Father New Guy.

871
00:59:24,103 --> 00:59:25,838
Okay, Father Time Checker.

872
00:59:25,871 --> 00:59:27,074
But can we
get another game though?

873
00:59:27,107 --> 00:59:28,208
It's getting late.

874
00:59:28,242 --> 00:59:31,111
I have to lock up, do rounds.

875
00:59:35,449 --> 00:59:38,452
You have time
for one more quick game.

876
00:59:38,485 --> 00:59:41,456
- Yes, yes!
- Yes! All right, ladies!

877
00:59:41,489 --> 00:59:43,925
Yo, Kacy, you deal.

878
00:59:44,392 --> 00:59:45,860
[squeals]

879
00:59:47,829 --> 00:59:49,831
Yo, Father Michael's
kind of hot.

880
00:59:49,864 --> 00:59:51,900
- Eww.
- He's a priest.

881
00:59:51,934 --> 00:59:53,435
What the hell is wrong with you?

882
00:59:53,469 --> 00:59:54,270
See, that's what

Once my wife started to change,

1065
01:21:36,646 --> 01:21:42,787
then... Ruth and I, we knew.

1066
01:21:42,821 --> 01:21:46,825
We hoped, we prayed that
we could...

1067
01:21:46,858 --> 01:21:48,359
That we could cure her.

1068
01:21:50,029 --> 01:21:53,265
So we brought her here
and we hid her.

1069
01:21:53,298 --> 01:21:56,836
[sniffles] And we've been
living this lie for ten years.

1070
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:06,412
But as things kept going,
she just got worse,

1071
01:22:06,446 --> 01:22:08,849
started getting
more aggressive...

1072
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:12,585
more just... hungry.

1073
01:22:14,488 --> 01:22:16,825
And we put in that door
to control her,

1074
01:22:16,858 --> 01:22:20,795
and... eventually,
I couldn't even give her meat...

1075
01:22:21,830 --> 01:22:23,965
from the market anymore.

1076
01:22:23,998 --> 01:22:25,633
It had to be alive.

1077
01:22:26,902 --> 01:22:28,703
So you started to feed her us?

1078
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:33,408
Oh, my God, what have we done?

1079
01:22:36,846 --> 01:22:38,949
We, uh, we...

1080
01:22:40,616 --> 01:22:44,386
We gave her
the program's undesirables.

anyone would miss.

Why did you need to kill,
Robbie?

1083
01:22:52,529 --> 01:22:55,332
He would have hurt her.

1084

hurt my wife.
