00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:29,369
You don't have my what?

183
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:31,022
Fuck you!

184
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:33,155
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: Paul The
Pawn was off his fucking nut.

185
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:35,157
He was also Carl's number one
player.

186
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:36,115
It used to be Nichols.

187
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:40,206
Nichols got turned out.

188
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:44,166
His team got kicked in,
remember?

189
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,124
Fuck you!

190
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:46,037
Get--

191
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:49,302
So, uh, he owes Paul how much?

192
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:06,536
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: Me, I was
different from those fools.

193
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,191
I was a hustler, sure, but I had
a goal.

194
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:14,979
And a hustler with a goal ended
up one of two ways.

195
00:19:15,023 --> 00:19:16,416
[INAUDIBLE]

196
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:17,373
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: Happy--

197
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:18,331
Chicago.

198
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:19,854
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: Or dead.

199
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:21,203
No, Boston.

200
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:22,422
[INAUDIBLE]

201
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:24,424
What the fuck is this, a
geography lesson?

202
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:25,338
This is bullshit.

203
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:28,515
I need some play [INAUDIBLE].

204
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:30,734
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: Cue Ball
Carl Bridgers.

205
00:19:30,778 --> 00:19:34,782
He was one of the best nine ball
players ever.

206
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:38,960
Now, he was just a stake horse.

207
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:40,048
You know, you never let a twist

208
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:41,832
get between you and the tribe.

209
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:44,705
You know what I mean?

210
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:46,054
Yeah?

211
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:47,838
Do you like arita?

212
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:49,449
Because I love arita.

213
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:55,585
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: The
shooting gallery.

214
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:58,414
Carl's own private fishing hole.

215
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,155
He sunk everything he had into
it.

216
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:08,816
At the end of the day, he took
70% of whatever we made.

217
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:11,035
Snap it.

218
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:13,124
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: One of the
things Carl taught us--

219
00:20:13,168 --> 00:20:15,388
never underestimate the
stupidity

220
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:16,519
of the general public.

221
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:26,834
And never show your speed until
the mark gave you

222
00:20:26,877 --> 00:20:28,227
what you wanted.

223
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,794
If I don't have bad luck, I
have no luck at all.

224
00:20:30,838 --> 00:20:32,231
Fuck it, I'm done.

225
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,145
You got me sown tighter than a
bull's ass tonight.

226
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:35,451
Ey, one more.

227
00:20:35,495 --> 00:20:37,279
I'll give you the five and the
break, c'mon.

228
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:39,368
But uh, it's 20 a game.

229
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:40,804
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: Like an
Orange Crush--

230
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:42,763
the five and the break.

231
00:20:42,806 --> 00:20:47,942
Wow, I have to be stupid not to
take that spot, uh?

232
00:20:47,985 --> 00:20:48,899
20 a game.

233
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:10,225
Can you fucking believe that?

234
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,445
I never shot stick--

235
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:14,708
come on, you gotta admit that's
a hell of a shot.

236
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:16,536
Run it back.

237
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:17,624
Fuck that, man.

238
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:18,581
I quit.

239
00:21:25,936 --> 00:21:26,807
Fuck.

240
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:35,206
[INAUDIBLE] gettin' you a
regular pay day.

241
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,383
You've been in dead stroke for
weeks now.

242
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:38,949
You know what I say Carl?

243
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:41,038
Give him a stick and he'll be as
cool as cool

244
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:43,519
as the other side of the pillow.

245
00:21:43,563 --> 00:21:44,955
I'm playin' OK.

246
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:46,261
W you say, son.

247
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,131
OK.

248
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:48,219
I'm going to bounce.

249
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:50,178
So, you guys can talk.

250
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:57,141
See you later, [INAUDIBLE].

251
00:21:57,185 --> 00:22:01,015
That's some dangerous pussy,
son.

252
00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:02,321
You smell it?

253
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:11,417
[INAUDIBLE] telling me that she
hear

254
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,680
about an ace nine baller coming
into town

255
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:16,726
by the name of Tenderloin Tony.

256
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,686
Now I've got me some history
with this fool.

257
00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:22,341
In this town, he's supposed to
be back by Rockefeller

258
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,473
[INAUDIBLE] wantin' to play
high,

259
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:28,390
so I want to run a long cream on
him.

260
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:30,871
No nine ball on this one.

261
00:22:30,914 --> 00:22:33,961
Consider yourself my player.

262
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:35,397
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: Moving up
in the tribe

263
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:38,661
was like hitting the jackpot on
your birthday.

264
00:22:38,705 --> 00:22:41,098
Nevermind Paul?

265
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:42,361
Paul's having some problems.

266
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:48,671
He's strictly front room from
now on.

267
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,418
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: It also
meant someone else

268
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:57,680
was going to be moving down.

269
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,641
RADIO: Detective [INAUDIBLE]
expressed his frustration

270
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:05,514
that the grand jury had failed
to hand out any indictments.

271
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:07,908
The city with the number one
murder rate in the nation.

272
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:10,650
The savagery of the triple
homicide involving three

273
00:23:10,693 --> 00:23:13,827
undercover NOPD detectives is
remembered as one

274
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,176
of the most brutal slayings.

275
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:25,795
Hiya, Bambi.

276
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:30,104
They call me thumper.

277
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,548
Thanks for talking me up,
making me look good to Carl.

278
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:43,552
So Carl made you his player
huh?

279
00:23:43,596 --> 00:23:45,206
Um, yes.

280
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:46,947
Thanks to you.

281
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,470
Thanks to me, right?

282
00:23:48,514 --> 00:23:55,216
So, I was thinking maybe--

283
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:57,174
Yeah?

284
00:23:57,218 --> 00:24:00,047
Listen, I landed this stake
horse the other night,

285
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,571
and he told me that if I could
get him a player,

286
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:05,356
he was going to give me a
finder's fee.

287
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,793
I need the money.

288
00:24:06,836 --> 00:24:07,968
So please?

289
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:13,539
OK.

290
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:14,453
Wait, Jez.

291
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:17,107
Come on.

292
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:23,723
I can help you but if Carl finds
me freelancing, I'm fucked.

293
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:24,637
You know that.

294
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,768
He won't.

295
00:24:25,812 --> 00:24:26,813
I promise.

296
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:35,038
So where'd you meet him?

297
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:58,366
Um, we can make a little money
while we wait.

298
00:24:58,409 --> 00:24:59,323
All right!

299
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,157
Hi.

300
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:08,158
How are ya?

301
00:25:08,202 --> 00:25:10,160
I'm good, how are you?

302
00:25:10,204 --> 00:25:11,422
I'm doing better.

303
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:54,161
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: Who showed
your ass in a pool ball.

304
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:55,118
You lost your stake.

305
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:05,128
And when I played with Jags, I
had fun.

306
00:26:05,172 --> 00:26:06,695
I just did.

307
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:09,219
The hard part was not letting it
show.

308
00:27:14,937 --> 00:27:16,286
Fuckin' hustler dog?

309
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,072
Nah, everyone has their
moments.

310
00:27:19,115 --> 00:27:20,073
That's what I thought.

311
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:21,857
He is part of a crew.

312
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:25,121
Woah, woah, easy, easy.

313
00:27:25,165 --> 00:27:27,994
You watch your fucking back.

314
00:27:28,037 --> 00:27:29,169
Hey, how are you guys doing?

315
00:27:29,212 --> 00:27:30,431
Sorry, I got hung up. - You're
late.

316
00:27:30,474 --> 00:27:31,301
We're leaving.

317
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:32,912
Where are you going?

318
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:35,915
You know if he leaves, you don't
get your finder's fee.

319
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:37,220
You any good, kid?

320
00:27:37,264 --> 00:27:39,440
It's going to cost you to find
out, all right?

321
00:27:39,483 --> 00:27:42,269
So that was him huh?

322
00:27:42,312 --> 00:27:44,837
[INAUDIBLE]

323
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,099
We made money.

324
00:27:46,142 --> 00:27:47,143
Glad we didn't make a deal with
the stakers,

325
00:27:47,187 --> 00:27:48,057
because I [INAUDIBLE].

326
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:50,538
Hey kid, I saw your tat.

327
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:54,411
That means you belong to Carl
Bridgers right?

328
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:58,720
Where are you on your way to,
Shooting Gallery?

329
00:27:58,764 --> 00:28:00,809
What if I told you I was staking
in a rogue player

330
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:03,464
from San Francisco looking to
play high.

331
00:28:03,507 --> 00:28:06,249
What do you say?

332
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:08,425
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]:
Coincidence.

333
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:13,039
Carl called it God's way of
remaining anonymous.

334
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:15,084
Got a name.

335
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:16,216
Fuck you.

336
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:17,173
Asshole.

337
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:21,700
Go around, fuckhead.

338
00:28:29,577 --> 00:28:31,318
Yeah, player's name?

339
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:32,232
Tenderloin Tony.

340
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:34,756
Ever heard of him?

341
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,627
He's a great fucking player.

342
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:39,326
See, I need somebody on the
inside to set it up, OK?

343
00:28:41,981 --> 00:28:42,895
You do that for us?

344
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,640
What, you're still waiting for
your finder's fee

345
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:50,685
aren't you honey?

346
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:58,606
Set it up for tonight, 10:00.

347
00:28:58,649 --> 00:28:59,520
I'll pay you then.

348
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:07,615
I'll take that as a yes. Silence
is a yes.

349
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,271
It wasn't a no.

350
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,543
[INAUDIBLE] a game.

351
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:25,024
Fuckin' unbelievable.

352
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:26,939
Why not?

353
00:29:26,982 --> 00:29:28,897
[INAUDIBLE]

354
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:30,638
[INAUDIBLE] the guy was right,
huh?

355
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:32,031
No way.

356
00:29:32,074 --> 00:29:33,162
He's a hustla'.

357
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:42,519
Some of the best hustlers are
cops.

358
00:29:42,563 --> 00:29:46,610
They're fucking cannibals man,
I'm telling you.

359
00:29:46,654 --> 00:29:48,699
You ever been busted by a vise?

360
00:29:48,743 --> 00:29:50,005
No.

You ever seen a vise sting in
action?

362
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,619
No.

363
00:29:55,663 --> 00:29:58,144
Do you know any vise cops,
Paul?

364
00:29:58,187 --> 00:29:59,101
No, I don't.

365
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:04,063
Well, thanks for the tip.

366
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:05,629
Next time I have a question
about a mark I'll

367
00:30:05,673 --> 00:30:06,848
make sure and ask you first.

368
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:08,850
Jez, tell Carl I'll be here for

369
00:30:08,894 --> 00:30:09,764
All right.

370
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:32,831
Oh, look at this boys.

Hey, listen.

I got the right.

378
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:55,331
You got him?

It's Tenderloin Tony.

And on the seventh day, God was
fucked up, so what'd he do?

399
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:53,275
He invented pool.

I've known him since he was

00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:21,842
Yeah, I'm a cop.

It's my day job.

00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:35,116
OK, here's the deal.

417
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,119
Still want you to set up that
game for me.

418
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:40,556
Bridgers can't know I'm a cop,
though.

419
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,297
OK, but listen, smart ass.

420
00:34:42,341 --> 00:34:43,907
Do the math.

421
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:46,040
You make the game.

422
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,173
Bridgers gets a shot at
Tenderloin Tony.

423
00:34:48,216 --> 00:34:52,002
He takes him down, you move to
the head of the class.

rocks in my head.

Shit.

to get here,

454
00:36:58,868 --> 00:37:01,610
but these two blue boys shook me
down.

00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:02,698
Honest to Christ, Carl.

456
00:37:32,946 --> 00:37:36,036
Kiss the Goat's ass.

457
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,434
Kiss it.

fuckin' with my action.

00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:53,314
You understand?

00:37:58,145 --> 00:38:00,321
Good thing I just finished
scrubbing.

00:38:03,106 --> 00:38:13,334
A clean office is a sign of a
clean establishment.

462
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:19,384
That's why every Monday, I come
here for scrubbing day.

463
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:24,302

anything out?

00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,012
Know what a slider is?

466
00:38:44,017 --> 00:38:48,195
A slider is an action that go so
well,

467
00:38:48,238 --> 00:38:50,502
the mark don't even know he's
been hit.

468
00:38:55,333 --> 00:39:01,904
Tenderloin Tony, but he gon' be
back.

469
00:39:01,948 --> 00:39:04,167
Can't help himself.

470
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:09,172
He think he got a chance to beat
me clean.

471
00:39:09,216 --> 00:39:14,177
So, we gon' run a slider on him.

472
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:17,659
Gon' call out his stake horse,
and gon' set him up way.

473
00:39:20,227 --> 00:39:26,364
And the next time he touch a
cue, is gon' be his last.

00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:31,717
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: Carl laid
it out.

475
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,414
Make another game with Tony.

476
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:34,676
Play him on the limit.

477
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,895
Make a show of it.

478
00:39:35,938 --> 00:39:37,549
Play the dandelion.

479
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:41,117
The idea was, once Tony realized
the level of play in the room,

480
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:43,816
he'd jump at the chance to play
Carl next.

481
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:45,426
That was the plan.

482
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,908
But I knew Tony's stake horse
was a fucking cop.

483
00:39:48,951 --> 00:39:51,214
So you decided to call.

484
00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:53,434
That's good.

485
00:39:53,478 --> 00:39:54,653
You tell bridgers I'm a cop?

486
00:39:57,438 --> 00:39:58,613
Did you tell him I'm a cop?

487
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:04,619
I didn't tell Carl shit OK?

488
00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:05,577
OK.

489
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:11,365
C'mon, get in.

490
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,584
Go for a ride.

491
00:40:26,685 --> 00:40:28,208
Look through those again,
anything stand out?

492
00:40:39,262 --> 00:40:45,486
That last one, in the room,

493
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:46,487
There's your video.

494
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:47,401
Yeah.

495
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:54,277
But I wasn't in the room when it
went down.

496
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:12,513
It's been the bane of my fucking
existence.

497
00:41:15,777 --> 00:41:17,475
Tape disappeared.

498
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:18,476
Bridgers was in that room.

499
00:41:22,741 --> 00:41:27,006
So Bridgers must be on that
table.

500
00:41:27,049 --> 00:41:28,573
Fucking fairytale.

502
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:34,448
You want to know how this ends?

503
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,756
DA deemed everything I had
circumstantial.

504
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:42,630
No DNA, no weapon, no videotape.

505
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:45,415
I lost my partner, my
assignment,

506
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:47,243
eventually my marriage.

507
00:41:47,287 --> 00:41:49,376
Because you couldn't prove
shit.

508
00:41:49,419 --> 00:41:53,032
Because I couldn't prove that
Bridgers was the trigger man.

509
00:41:53,075 --> 00:41:55,556
You scratched on the eight
ball.

510
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,515
Yeah.

511
00:41:57,558 --> 00:41:58,690
But I got a plan.

512
00:41:58,733 --> 00:42:01,431
Hustle if you will, to get
what's owed.

513
00:42:01,475 --> 00:42:02,911
Starts with that table.

514
00:42:06,698 --> 00:42:08,438
I know Bridgers.

515
00:42:08,482 --> 00:42:09,831
I know what he likes.

516
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:12,921
Especially, I know what he
hates.

517
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:15,097
He hates Tenderloin Tony.

518
00:42:15,141 --> 00:42:17,839
So I called him.

519
00:42:17,883 --> 00:42:21,190
I told him I was a stake horse.

520
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:23,932
[INAUDIBLE] high stakes game
with Bridgers, and if you

521
00:42:23,976 --> 00:42:26,761
want to be my player.

522
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:30,548
And I need you to find a way
into the Shooting Gallery.

523
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:34,987
Desperation makes people do a
lot of stupid things.

524
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,858
And that girl of yours?

525
00:42:36,902 --> 00:42:38,817
Desperate.

526
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:45,563
She led me to you, unknowingly
of course.

527
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:47,303
So this whole thing was a
fucking setup?

528
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,450
COP: Bridgers has that tape.

529
00:43:03,493 --> 00:43:05,713
Took it for insurance.

530
00:43:05,757 --> 00:43:13,199
He owns the one thing I need,
and I

531
00:43:13,242 --> 00:43:15,767
need that game to win it back.

532
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:17,377
I can't get it any other way.

533
00:43:20,728 --> 00:43:23,470
Why the hell would Carl stake a
videotape that proves

534
00:43:23,513 --> 00:43:25,951
he killed someone?

535
00:43:25,994 --> 00:43:30,520
Allow me to demonstrate.

536
00:43:30,564 --> 00:43:31,652
You know what a blank is?

537
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:37,745
Of course you do.

538
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:39,660
Fake bullet.

539
00:43:39,704 --> 00:43:44,099
All bang, no bite.

540
00:43:44,143 --> 00:43:46,798
Right?

541
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:49,539
You know it's a blank, but
you're

542
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:51,498
afraid to move aren't you?

543
00:43:51,541 --> 00:43:52,542
Go ahead, move.

544
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:58,157
I pull this trigger, there's
enough powder in there

545
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,028
to send a part of your skull
right through your brain.

546
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:11,039
You're a smart kid, but you only
got one move.

547
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:13,999
Set up my game for me.

548
00:44:14,042 --> 00:44:17,219
Set up my fucking game for me.

549
00:44:17,263 --> 00:44:18,133
I'll let you take a walk.

550
00:44:24,183 --> 00:44:26,011
I gotta take this.

551
00:44:29,014 --> 00:44:30,102
Hello?

552
00:44:30,145 --> 00:44:31,016
What?

553
00:44:35,411 --> 00:44:37,762
It is the right amount,
Michelle.

554
00:44:37,805 --> 00:44:38,850
Hang on a sec.

555
00:44:38,893 --> 00:44:40,982
Is Katie in the same room with
you?

556
00:44:41,026 --> 00:44:43,115
Could you try just a little bit
harder to humiliate me

557
00:44:43,158 --> 00:44:44,986
right the fuck in front of her?

558
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:46,292
Yeah, well I happen to be in a
meeting

559
00:44:46,335 --> 00:44:49,774
here myself, incidentally.

560
00:44:49,817 --> 00:44:52,211
So I set up the game, you let
me skate?

561
00:44:52,254 --> 00:44:53,342
On my word.

562
00:44:53,386 --> 00:44:55,867
Could you do me a favor, will
you--

563
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,172
OK, so what is it?

564
00:44:57,216 --> 00:44:58,870
How much is it, according to
you?

565
00:44:58,913 --> 00:45:01,133
The right and proper amount you
blackmailing--

566
00:45:01,176 --> 00:45:02,917
Katie, hi, hi.

567
00:45:02,961 --> 00:45:05,093
How you doing?

568
00:45:05,137 --> 00:45:08,618
No, no, we're not fighting.

569
00:45:08,662 --> 00:45:11,491
Did your mother get you to say
that?

570
00:45:11,534 --> 00:45:14,973
Yeah, well, you tell her 2000 is
easily enough.

571
00:45:15,016 --> 00:45:15,930
Hello?

572
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:31,511
I can't see my daughter unless I
send

573
00:45:31,554 --> 00:45:32,947
her a maintenance check in the
amount

574
00:45:32,991 --> 00:45:35,863
that she thinks is right.

575
00:45:41,434 --> 00:45:44,785
So what do you say?

576
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:45,699
We got a deal?

577
00:45:50,922 --> 00:45:53,576
There's something you need to
know about hustlers.

578
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:57,929
First, we're all about the
money.

579
00:45:57,972 --> 00:46:00,932
Now, you only just met Tony.

580
00:46:00,975 --> 00:46:02,585
Called him on the phone.

581
00:46:02,629 --> 00:46:05,850
Told him you had some money to
play.

582
00:46:05,893 --> 00:46:09,418
As long as you got some money,
he's got an opportunity

583
00:46:09,462 --> 00:46:13,031
to make it offa you.

584
00:46:13,074 --> 00:46:16,034
What are you trying to say.

585
00:46:16,077 --> 00:46:18,732
I think maybe he's working a
double-dump on you.

586
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:19,820
Can you do me a favor?

587
00:46:19,864 --> 00:46:22,692
Could you speak fucking English?

588
00:46:22,736 --> 00:46:26,479
Doing some business on you, with
Carl?

589
00:46:26,522 --> 00:46:29,569
Thought ever cross your mind?

590
00:46:29,612 --> 00:46:30,962
I don't doubt Bridgers could
talk

591
00:46:31,005 --> 00:46:33,703
the Virgin Mary herself into
picking up a hammer,

592
00:46:33,747 --> 00:46:35,053
but here's the thing.

593
00:46:39,709 --> 00:46:40,667
That was a blank.

594
00:46:43,844 --> 00:46:48,370
My other gun doesn't take
blanks.

595
00:46:54,855 --> 00:46:56,335
You set up the game for tonight.

596
00:47:00,905 --> 00:47:01,819
That hurt?

597
00:47:06,258 --> 00:47:07,172
Don't try to fuck me.

598
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:16,659
Jez.

599
00:47:16,703 --> 00:47:18,009
Hey, what happened?

600
00:47:18,052 --> 00:47:19,140
This whole situation.

601
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:30,054
What's with the bags?

602
00:49:30,097 --> 00:49:31,011
You gonna go some place?

603
00:49:38,323 --> 00:49:39,237
Not now.

604
00:49:43,502 --> 00:49:45,852
You're sweet.

605
00:49:45,895 --> 00:49:48,724
You don't understand.

606
00:49:48,768 --> 00:49:52,250
You have that one backwards
kiddo.

607
00:49:52,293 --> 00:49:53,512
You get to know me a little
better,

608
00:49:53,555 --> 00:49:54,600
you'll see this is what I do.

609
00:49:57,342 --> 00:50:00,040
What, run away?

610
00:50:00,084 --> 00:50:03,696
You don't think I know about
that?

611
00:50:03,739 --> 00:50:05,045
That's not what I meant,
Jericho.

612
00:50:12,922 --> 00:50:17,449
Listen, I'm an addict.

613
00:50:17,492 --> 00:50:22,889
It's just that instead of
sticking needles up my arm

614
00:50:22,932 --> 00:50:24,369
I gamble a lot.

615
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:32,072
And what happens when you gamble
is that sooner or later,

616
00:50:32,116 --> 00:50:34,857
you have to leave.

617
00:50:34,901 --> 00:50:36,468
You have to jet.

618
00:50:36,511 --> 00:50:38,513
Things got a little too hot.

619
00:50:38,557 --> 00:50:39,906
You gotta go.

620
00:50:39,949 --> 00:50:41,299
That's what I'm doing.

621
00:50:41,342 --> 00:50:42,648
It's all right.

622
00:50:42,691 --> 00:50:44,345
I would've.

623
00:50:44,389 --> 00:50:45,433
You don't take what I say?

624
00:50:54,877 --> 00:50:58,403
TENDERLOIN TONY: Did you know
that in World War II,

625
00:50:58,446 --> 00:51:08,152
Japs would use crystal meth to
give

626
00:51:08,195 --> 00:51:11,807
the Japanese pilots on the
suicide mission,

627
00:51:11,851 --> 00:51:14,810
right before they went off.

628
00:51:14,854 --> 00:51:17,683
They would fly off into the
sunrise

629
00:51:17,726 --> 00:51:24,603
feeling better than they ever
did in their goddamn lives.

630
00:51:24,646 --> 00:51:32,045
Something poetic about
experiencing

631
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,047
the pinnacle of pleasure.

632
00:51:38,704 --> 00:51:39,531
Hope you don't mind.

633
00:51:39,574 --> 00:51:42,621
It was open. Fuckhead.

634
00:51:42,664 --> 00:51:44,013
You were supposed to meet me an
hour ago.

635
00:51:44,057 --> 00:51:45,493
What the fuck?

636
00:51:45,537 --> 00:51:46,712
Hey, it's OK.

637
00:51:46,755 --> 00:51:48,192
Hey, it's OK.

638
00:51:48,235 --> 00:51:49,106
Close the door.

639
00:51:49,149 --> 00:51:50,150
Close the door, Tony.

640
00:51:50,194 --> 00:51:51,108
Close the door.

641
00:51:53,893 --> 00:51:55,503
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

642
00:52:05,948 --> 00:52:07,733
Take your fucking hand off me.

643
00:52:07,776 --> 00:52:11,824
Fuck it Fuck you.

00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:14,174
That's my fucking drugs.

645
00:52:14,218 --> 00:52:15,741
That shit is expensive man.

646
00:52:15,784 --> 00:52:18,439
Open your mouth.

647
00:52:18,483 --> 00:52:22,008
That's expensive shit.

648
00:52:22,051 --> 00:52:22,878
Come on.

649
00:52:22,922 --> 00:52:23,836
Tony, fuck off.

650
00:52:27,883 --> 00:52:28,884
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

651
00:52:28,928 --> 00:52:29,755
Here we go.

652
00:52:29,798 --> 00:52:30,712
Good girl.

653
00:52:33,498 --> 00:52:35,413
Fuck you.

654
00:52:35,456 --> 00:52:37,458
Take your fucking hand off me.

655
00:52:41,201 --> 00:52:43,334
Fuck you.

00:52:44,813 --> 00:52:46,728
You said we were gonna fucking
play high.

658

We're going to come down to New

take Carl for everything he's
got.

Take his fuckin' money, take his
pool hall, take everything.

Is she OK?

665
00:53:27,726 --> 00:53:30,076
I cannot think with all that
fuckin' noise.

666
00:53:34,733 --> 00:53:36,691
Look at me, Tony.

667
00:53:36,735 --> 00:53:39,172
Look me straight in the eye.

668
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,435

Yeah.

00:54:01,412 --> 00:54:03,979
Good.

676
00:54:04,023 --> 00:54:04,937
I'm on my way.

677
00:54:09,028 --> 00:54:12,423
Tony, you stick to the plan.

678
00:54:12,466 --> 00:54:16,514
Part of which being put on some
fucking clothes.

679
00:54:26,959 --> 00:54:27,829
I'm good.

680
00:54:27,873 --> 00:54:28,743
How are you?

681
00:54:48,067 --> 00:54:50,112
Hey Jez.

683
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:53,115
You're not thinking of going in
there

00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:55,074
and spending some of my money
now are you?

685
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,035
I was just going to call you.

686
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:01,863
Oh, I see.

687
00:55:01,907 --> 00:55:03,038
Going to a party later.

688
00:55:03,082 --> 00:55:05,954
Maybe you can join us?

689
00:55:05,998 --> 00:55:08,740
I'd love to, but--

690
00:55:08,783 --> 00:55:11,046
But what Jez?

691
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:13,788
You see what would my friends
say if they see me fucking

692
00:55:13,832 --> 00:55:17,009
around with a cock like you.

693
00:55:17,052 --> 00:55:19,403
Where does she think she's
going?

694
00:55:19,446 --> 00:55:20,447
Let's go.

695
00:56:06,014 --> 00:56:07,973
Tenderloin Tony.

696
00:56:08,016 --> 00:56:10,192
I'm fishing for Carl.

697
00:56:10,236 --> 00:56:13,674
You want Carl, you gotta go
through me first.

698
00:56:13,718 --> 00:56:15,546
After last night's no-show?

699
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:16,503
You get some stones.

700
00:56:20,202 --> 00:56:22,074
OK, I might.

701
00:56:22,117 --> 00:56:24,032
Here it is.

702
00:56:24,076 --> 00:56:27,775
Race tonight, Cecil a game.

703
00:56:27,819 --> 00:56:29,342
And then Carl runs.

704
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,909
Five large, even.

705
00:56:30,952 --> 00:56:34,521
Until someone pulls up or drains
out.

706
00:56:34,565 --> 00:56:37,002
OK.

707
00:56:37,045 --> 00:56:41,267
Hey, you bought it, you break
it.

708
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:46,881
All right, but not on that
table.

709
00:56:50,189 --> 00:56:53,061
What you mean "none of that
type"?

710
00:56:53,105 --> 00:56:54,019
This one.

711
00:56:56,935 --> 00:56:58,197
Why that table and not this
table?

712
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,161
Yeah, this table, for sure.

713
00:57:06,205 --> 00:57:09,034
OK.

714
00:57:09,077 --> 00:57:13,255
First, I want you to tell me
why you don't like this table.

715
00:57:13,299 --> 00:57:14,648
I don't like that table.

716
00:57:14,692 --> 00:57:15,562
Fuck that.

717
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:21,960
We play on this table, or we
don't play.

718
00:57:26,094 --> 00:57:27,705
Fine.

719
00:57:27,748 --> 00:57:28,662
We'll play on that table.

720
00:57:39,804 --> 00:57:41,719

shower,

904
01:13:32,756 --> 01:13:35,759
sings along with it, not very
good.

905
01:13:35,802 --> 01:13:40,024
It's a picture of her mother,
Rachel, in pretty silver frame,

906
01:13:40,067 --> 01:13:42,330
by the edge of the bed, along
with.

907
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:51,688
You pickin' up what I'm laying
down?

908
01:13:51,731 --> 01:13:53,080
I believe this is what is
referred

909
01:13:53,124 --> 01:13:57,476
to as binding arbitration.

910
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,740
I'll get you the fucking tape,
but we do it my way.

911
01:14:00,784 --> 01:14:03,917
Be at the Shooting Gallery, five
to midnight.

912
01:14:03,961 --> 01:14:06,354
When this is all over, you gotta
promise

913
01:14:06,398 --> 01:14:07,878
to leave us alone for good.

914
01:14:07,921 --> 01:14:10,620
Cross my heart, and hope to
die.

915
01:14:10,663 --> 01:14:12,056
And that gun in there?

916
01:14:12,099 --> 01:14:13,231
That's from me.

917
01:14:13,274 --> 01:14:14,232
You carry it.

918
01:14:14,275 --> 01:14:15,581
I'll tell you when I need it.

919
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:17,104
Mortensen.

920
01:14:17,148 --> 01:14:20,804
If you fuck me, you'll never get
that tape.

921
01:14:20,847 --> 01:14:21,718
But I will.

922
01:14:48,396 --> 01:14:49,223
Woah, woah, woah.

923
01:14:49,267 --> 01:14:50,137
No, no.

924
01:14:50,181 --> 01:14:51,530
Take this.

925
01:14:51,574 --> 01:14:52,705
Take this.

926
01:14:52,749 --> 01:14:56,753
Meet me at Algiers point, 12:30
tonight.

927
01:14:56,796 --> 01:15:00,583
If I'm not there, fly to your
brother's.

928
01:15:05,805 --> 01:15:06,937
You're going to show up, right?

929
01:15:12,551 --> 01:15:13,552
Please?

930
01:15:13,596 --> 01:15:14,510
Please?

931
01:15:24,302 --> 01:15:25,259
12:30.

932
01:15:31,178 --> 01:15:33,398
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: Hardest
thing about being a hustler?

933
01:15:33,441 --> 01:15:34,878
Trust.

934
01:15:34,921 --> 01:15:36,706
You trusted no one.

935
01:15:36,749 --> 01:15:39,317
You never got took.

936
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,361
I spoke to the cop.

937
01:15:40,405 --> 01:15:42,233
He's coming for you, Carl.

938
01:15:45,932 --> 01:15:48,544
Last night, it was a test.

939
01:15:51,024 --> 01:15:52,809
The only the way you could know
if you could trust me.

940
01:15:55,899 --> 01:16:00,599
See, at first, I thought that
detective was off his nut.

941
01:16:00,643 --> 01:16:02,470
Desperate.

942
01:16:02,514 --> 01:16:05,343
Thinking he could get you to
stake the tape on a game,

943
01:16:05,386 --> 01:16:07,606
a tape that could send you to
jail, mm-mm.

944
01:16:12,524 --> 01:16:15,353
What happened in that apartment?

945
01:16:15,396 --> 01:16:18,661
That you didn't kill his men and
take his money?

946
01:16:24,536 --> 01:16:25,406
Tell me, Carl.

947
01:16:36,722 --> 01:16:41,292
Mortenson doesn't want that tape
because you're on it.

948
01:16:41,335 --> 01:16:45,339
MAD BOY: Oops, you scratched on
the eight ball, son.

949
01:16:48,734 --> 01:16:50,431
He wants the tape because he's
on it.

950
01:16:53,391 --> 01:16:56,263
Am I right?

951
01:16:56,307 --> 01:16:59,658
Tell me I'm right.

952
01:16:59,702 --> 01:17:03,140
What's worse than a cop killer?

953
01:17:03,183 --> 01:17:04,054
Shoot him, kill him.

954
01:17:07,144 --> 01:17:08,624
That's your boy, not mine.

955
01:17:12,453 --> 01:17:14,194
A cop-- that's a cop killer.

956
01:17:18,895 --> 01:17:24,640
What does it take to make a law
man into an outlaw?

957
01:17:24,683 --> 01:17:28,252
Show me the money

958
01:17:28,295 --> 01:17:32,430
Three quarters of a mill a good
place to start.

959
01:17:32,473 --> 01:17:34,693
It was his operation.

960
01:17:34,737 --> 01:17:36,042
It was his partner.

961
01:17:36,086 --> 01:17:37,000
Cops.

962
01:17:40,612 --> 01:17:43,006
I like to call them the blue
tribe,

963
01:17:43,049 --> 01:17:48,054
and the blue tribe are the best
hustlers of them all.

964
01:17:48,098 --> 01:17:53,233
He took his shot, made me an
offer,

965
01:17:53,277 --> 01:17:57,107
I said if I help him pull it
off, I get half.

966
01:17:57,150 --> 01:17:59,413
Enough to purchase my pool hall.

967
01:17:59,457 --> 01:18:00,371
So what happened?

968
01:18:11,425 --> 01:18:14,690
He wanted to make me his Patsy.

969
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:22,915
He wanted to pin the whole thing
on ol' Carl.

970
01:18:22,959 --> 01:18:24,787
Let me go to the big house for
life.

971
01:18:27,659 --> 01:18:35,406
I saw it comin', and I took the
money and the tape.

972
01:18:35,449 --> 01:18:37,234
Smile.

973
01:18:37,277 --> 01:18:38,496
You on candid camera.

974
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:46,765
So you have it?

975
01:18:46,809 --> 01:18:51,248
If I wanted, you'd die.

976
01:18:59,691 --> 01:19:00,561
BANG!

977
01:19:04,522 --> 01:19:05,828
[LAUGHING]

978
01:19:05,871 --> 01:19:07,133
Come on' Jez.

979
01:19:36,032 --> 01:19:37,729
Now look around here, huh.

980
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:40,036
This here is what it's got me.

981
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:44,257
Well, you're one hell of a
player, son.

982
01:19:44,301 --> 01:19:47,826
What say you and me take a
little road trip?

983
01:19:47,870 --> 01:19:53,440
You know, my stake, your game,
my experience.

984
01:19:53,484 --> 01:19:54,746
Boy, we'd be unsinkable.

985
01:20:12,242 --> 01:20:16,246
Boy, you done lost your natural
mind.

986
01:20:16,289 --> 01:20:17,987
It ain't that easy, Carl.

987
01:20:22,165 --> 01:20:25,690
It just ain't that easy.

988
01:20:30,173 --> 01:20:31,217
Holy bejesus, boy.

989
01:20:31,261 --> 01:20:32,958
Where you get all that money?

990
01:20:33,002 --> 01:20:35,134
It's mine.

991
01:20:35,178 --> 01:20:37,354
Do you want it?

992
01:20:37,397 --> 01:20:38,398
You gotta get in a grease.

993
01:20:45,101 --> 01:20:48,800
Everybody get the hell out of
here.

994
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:49,888
Easy, close the do' behind.

995
01:20:55,589 --> 01:20:57,200
You don't want none of this,
son.

996
01:21:05,469 --> 01:21:06,557
Nine ball?

997
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,514
Sure as shit.

998
01:21:09,995 --> 01:21:12,258
[SINGING]

999
01:21:15,827 --> 01:21:16,784
You gonna give me weight?

1000
01:21:16,828 --> 01:21:17,655
Nah.

1001
01:21:17,698 --> 01:21:19,135
You're serious.

1002
01:21:19,178 --> 01:21:24,357
[INAUDIBLE]

1003
01:21:24,401 --> 01:21:26,359
Thousand a game?

1004
01:21:26,403 --> 01:21:29,928
10, 10 raise to 11.

1005
01:21:29,972 --> 01:21:31,625
Done.

1006
01:21:31,669 --> 01:21:33,105
This table cool.

1007
01:21:33,149 --> 01:21:34,019
Flip it up.

1008
01:21:41,287 --> 01:21:43,202
I'm going to put you in the
electric chair.

1009
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:48,773
Good break.

1010
01:22:02,004 --> 01:22:05,094
OK, just a couple of hands,
talk about [INAUDIBLE]..

1011
01:22:05,137 --> 01:22:06,095
What's the problem?

1012
01:22:06,138 --> 01:22:07,792
What's the problem?

1013
01:22:07,835 --> 01:22:09,925
There's no problem.

1014
01:22:09,968 --> 01:22:10,882
There's no problem.

1015
01:22:21,545 --> 01:22:26,898
Sometimes I just like to look
at myself a little when I play.

1016
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:30,597
The sharper you look the sharper
you play.

1017
01:22:30,641 --> 01:22:31,816
You don't know nothin' about
that

1018
01:22:31,859 --> 01:22:33,252
judging by the way you dress.

1019
01:23:10,376 --> 01:23:13,336
That's five on the road, Carl.

1020
01:23:13,379 --> 01:23:15,555
You hustling me?

1021
01:23:15,599 --> 01:23:18,732
Son, I never played this game
before in my life.

1022
01:23:21,257 --> 01:23:22,562
You're sharking me now?

1023
01:23:22,606 --> 01:23:25,913
I wouldn't think of it, son.

1024
01:23:25,957 --> 01:23:33,791
By the by, where's that sweet
little twist, Jezebel?

1025
01:23:33,834 --> 01:23:35,793
She ever tell you about the time
I got her

1026
01:23:35,836 --> 01:23:37,229
the job at the donut factory?

1027
01:23:40,102 --> 01:23:44,932
You know what her job specialty
was? s Sucking the hole out

1028
01:23:44,976 --> 01:23:46,195
the donut.

1029
01:23:46,238 --> 01:23:48,458
Leave her out of this.

1030
01:23:48,501 --> 01:23:51,069
She was very, very good at it,
too.

1031
01:23:51,113 --> 01:23:55,073
Don't try to get in my head,
break.

1032
01:23:55,117 --> 01:23:56,031
Damn.

1033
01:24:12,917 --> 01:24:15,615
You like that, don't you.

1034
01:24:15,659 --> 01:24:17,226
Thinkin' maybe I take the heat.

1035
01:24:19,793 --> 01:24:22,013
Good call.

1036
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:25,060
That's real good.

1037
01:24:25,103 --> 01:24:35,026
Because if you like that, you're
going to love this.

1038
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,941
No, now that's impossible.

1039
01:24:36,984 --> 01:24:38,856
I've been clocking you for a
month of Sundays.

1040
01:24:38,899 --> 01:24:41,250
Ain't no way you can shoot on
that side.

1041
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:22,029
Then he'll call.

1042
01:25:26,599 --> 01:25:29,428
That's a pretty neat trick you
pulled, holding

1043
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:30,821
back your speed that long.

1044
01:25:33,737 --> 01:25:35,173
What you after, son?

1045
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:43,790
Oops.

1046
01:25:52,059 --> 01:25:53,844
Winner take all.

1047
01:25:53,887 --> 01:25:58,805
The money, and the tape.

1048
01:25:58,849 --> 01:26:01,156
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: And there
it was.

1049
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:02,940
A normal person would've walked
with his cash,

1050
01:26:02,983 --> 01:26:06,378
and hopped the train with his
girl to a better life.

1051
01:26:06,422 --> 01:26:09,251
C'mon son.

1052
01:26:09,294 --> 01:26:11,862
You finally a hustler, now.

1053
01:26:11,905 --> 01:26:14,299
JERICHO [VOICEOVER]: But I am a
hustler, remember.

1054
01:26:14,343 --> 01:26:15,474
Done.

1055
01:26:15,518 --> 01:26:16,388
Rack 'em.

1056
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:33,275
What the fuck?

1057
01:26:33,318 --> 01:26:35,668
What the fuck?

1058
01:26:35,712 --> 01:26:37,148
I'm looking for Jericho, give
me the keys.

1059
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:38,367
- Give me the keys. - Huh?

1060
01:26:38,410 --> 01:26:39,324
- Give me the fucking keys! -
I'm sorry.

1061
01:26:39,368 --> 01:26:40,238
I'm sorry.

1062
01:26:40,282 --> 01:26:41,196
I'm sorry.

1063
01:27:25,283 --> 01:27:26,763
What's the matter.

1064
01:27:26,806 --> 01:27:28,591
You feeling guilty, son?

1065
01:27:40,342 --> 01:27:41,734
Where's all the white women at?

1066
01:27:51,135 --> 01:27:52,136
You right.

1067
01:27:59,056 --> 01:28:00,187
So here we all stand.

1068
01:28:04,104 --> 01:28:07,107
Jericho, you with me or that?

1069
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:17,770
Binding arbitration, remember.

1070
01:28:17,814 --> 01:28:19,859
Go on, make it.

1071
01:28:19,903 --> 01:28:22,122
I get the tape.

1072
01:28:22,166 --> 01:28:23,428
You live happily ever after.

1073
01:28:26,388 --> 01:28:27,432
Happily ever after.

1074
01:28:27,476 --> 01:28:28,520
What kind of talk is that?

1075
01:28:28,564 --> 01:28:31,349
Fairy tale.

1076
01:28:31,393 --> 01:28:34,526
You dog it.

1077
01:28:34,570 --> 01:28:35,788
All is forgiven, son.

1078
01:28:46,146 --> 01:28:48,061
Hi, fuckhead.

1079
01:28:48,105 --> 01:28:51,500
Motherfucker.

1080
01:28:51,543 --> 01:28:54,024
