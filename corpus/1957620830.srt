Six whole orders!

351
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,706
We make a great team,
you and I.

352
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,041
Much better than two guys.

353
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,610
What are you talking about?
We're already a team,
you and I.

354
00:17:57,644 --> 00:17:59,412
Well, at home, sure.

355
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,349
You don't want me
at home?

356
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,517
In the bedroom
with the lights out.

357
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,286

Hey, Jules?
Yeah?

360
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:15,428
Being a housewife
is wonderful,

361
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,630
but it's only
half a life.

362
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:20,767
You know, I feel like
the other half of me
is being wasted.

363
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,902
I can be a wife to you
and a mother to Margo,

364
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,705
and still do a lot more
than just stay home all day.

365
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,140
What are you, superwoman?

366
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:29,209
No, just capable.

367
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:30,543
Yeah. Well, listen...

368
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:32,345
You better lay off
stroking my muscles
in public.

369
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:33,813
(CHUCKLES)
It's driving
those housewives crazy.

370
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,748
Come on, Jules.
I'm serious.

371
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,817
I'm serious, too.
Manny is the guy...

372
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,886
Oh, Manny! Those women
were paying attention to me.
Did you notice?

373
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:40,820
Yes, I noticed.

374
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,622
Yeah. And who sold
six orders in one day?

375
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,658
JULES: You are relentless!

376
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:47,327
All right.
What do you say, Jules?

377
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,895
It's a deal?
We're partners?
(SIGHING)

378
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:52,932

379

Thank you. Love you!

380
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:55,635
I'll check on Margo.

381
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,304
Okay. Hurry back.

Jules, what's the matter?

384
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,250
I just got a new job.

385
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:12,919
And they don't
take partners.

386
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,687
JULES: I'm drafted.

387
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:26,799
Yeah.

Give Jules our love.

00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:32,339
Hi, sweetheart.

391
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:34,274
Eppie again.

392
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:36,609
She's certainly
gonna miss Jules.

I'm gonna be
there with him.

we're doing this.

Mama always said,

"When you're down in
the dumps, buy a new hat."
(EPPIE LAUGHING)

399
00:19:57,964 --> 00:20:01,401
Oh, Popo, it's so good
to have you in Chicago.

400
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:02,635
Although I feel
a little guilty

401
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,937
about not volunteering
at the hospital today.

402
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,639
It's like
we're playing hooky.

What's the matter?

406
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,914
I am scared to death, Eppie.
What if they get sent
overseas?

407
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,783
Cheer up, sissy,
they're gonna be fine.

How can you be so calm?

410
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:23,290
I'm not.
I miss Jules terribly.

411
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:25,525
Oh, we would have been
so great working together.

412

you actually enjoyed
selling pots and pans.

No, not our style.

416
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:35,935
Yeah? Not yours, maybe.

417
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,475
Ooh, are you
going to get it?

418
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:43,843
I love it.

419

Oh, but not that much.

420
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:47,814
But it looked fabulous!

421
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:48,781
No, I'll just
keep looking.

422
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:49,849
Let me buy it
for you.

423
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:52,319
No, Popo,
that's not how it goes.

424
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,354
Oh, come on.
It makes me happy
to see you happy.

we got these hats, Eppie?

Oh, it looks great on you.

427

we could wear that color.

more Betty Grable.

00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,986
if mine was
a little different?

Eppie, being the same
is what makes us unique.

how special I am,

I just look at you.

But, Popo, I'm not you.

of it that way.

from Chicago called again.

the offer.

would tire them out.

something for me?

You've got to talk to Dad
about your marriage.

Just do it, Mom.

do all of that.

take all the credit.

1707
01:25:02,465 --> 01:25:04,333
Look, Mom,

1708
01:25:05,634 --> 01:25:07,570
I know this has been
a tough year for you,

1709
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:09,605
but I think it
would be a shame
if you didn't go.

1710
01:25:09,638 --> 01:25:11,407
What makes you think
I'm not going?

1711
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,608
You haven't
started packing.

1712
01:25:14,177 --> 01:25:16,479
I can't.

1713
01:25:16,512 --> 01:25:17,546
I know what's gonna happen.

1714
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:19,482
We all know
what's gonna happen.

1715
01:25:19,515 --> 01:25:21,484
Maybe if you
talk to her.

1716
01:25:21,517 --> 01:25:23,352
No.
At least call her.

1717
01:25:23,386 --> 01:25:25,388
If I call her, she's just
gonna think I'm trying
to influence her,

1718
01:25:25,421 --> 01:25:26,855
one way or the other.

1719
01:25:26,889 --> 01:25:28,757
What is she going
to think if you
don't call her?

1720
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:35,431
MARGO: Maybe she's going
through the exact same
thing you are right now.

1721
01:25:36,199 --> 01:25:37,200
(BOTH SIGHING)

1722
01:25:37,233 --> 01:25:39,435
Mom,

1723
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:42,771
when I look
at those pictures
in those old albums,

1724
01:25:42,805 --> 01:25:44,507
I can't believe
how close you were.

1725
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:49,245
We really were.

1726
01:25:51,847 --> 01:25:53,616
Life was just
so much simpler then.

1727
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:57,420
You know, we were just
Eppie and Popo.

1728
01:25:57,453 --> 01:26:00,556
(SIGHING)
You know, whenever
I think of high school, I...

1729
01:26:00,589 --> 01:26:03,192
That's what I think of.

1730
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:05,961
But now, whenever
we get together,

1731
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:07,596
there's always
some problem,

1732
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:09,698
and we just end up
hurting each other.

1733
01:26:09,732 --> 01:26:13,936
Mom, stop worrying
about what Aunt Popo
is going to do.

1734
01:26:15,838 --> 01:26:17,573
I know you've been
looking forward
to this reunion.

1735
01:26:17,606 --> 01:26:19,242
You're being honored.

1736
01:26:19,275 --> 01:26:21,244
Take a chance. Just go.

1737
01:26:22,745 --> 01:26:24,880
Let the chips fall
where they may.

1738
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:32,755
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

1739
01:26:38,461 --> 01:26:39,595
So, you think
I should go in?

1740
01:26:40,796 --> 01:26:42,398
You're asking
my advice?

1741
01:26:43,599 --> 01:26:45,434
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

1742
01:26:47,370 --> 01:26:48,771
Is that her?

1743
01:27:01,517 --> 01:27:02,818
(CAR DOOR CLOSING)

1744
01:27:13,329 --> 01:27:14,863
(CAR DOOR CLOSING)

1745
01:27:22,405 --> 01:27:23,606
How are you doing?

1746
01:27:23,639 --> 01:27:25,608
Ann Landers,
eternal optimist.

1747
01:27:26,409 --> 01:27:27,576
And how's Eppie?

1748
01:27:28,043 --> 01:27:29,712
She's been better.

1749
01:27:30,779 --> 01:27:32,981
She misses her sister.

1750
01:27:33,015 --> 01:27:35,684
We have both lost
so much time.

1751
01:27:35,718 --> 01:27:37,052
Yeah, we can't go back.

1752
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:37,953
No, I know,

1753
01:27:39,522 --> 01:27:41,490
but we can
start fresh.

1754
01:27:41,524 --> 01:27:42,525
From right now.

1755
01:27:43,392 --> 01:27:44,693
I'd like that.

1756
01:27:54,036 --> 01:27:55,037
Come on.

1757
01:27:57,940 --> 01:27:59,975
Popo, I have a
confession to make.

1758
01:28:00,008 --> 01:28:02,945
I keep your "Top 10
Reasons to Smile"
list over my desk.

1759
01:28:02,978 --> 01:28:04,847
No, really?

1760
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:07,683
Oh, I read your
column first thing
every morning.

1761
01:28:07,716 --> 01:28:08,884
Really?

1762
01:28:08,917 --> 01:28:10,686
Well, second thing,
anyway.

1763
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:13,956
(LAUGHING) Well,
I never miss
yours either, Ep.

1764
01:28:13,989 --> 01:28:15,858
I love your dress.
You know,
I almost bought it.

1765
01:28:15,891 --> 01:28:17,560
Oh, I almost didn't.

1766
01:28:17,593 --> 01:28:19,995
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1767
01:28:20,028 --> 01:28:23,599
Okay, sis,
it's show time.
I'm ready.

1768
01:28:23,632 --> 01:28:26,635
EPPIE: Oh, thank goodness
they were wearing nametags.

1769
01:28:26,669 --> 01:28:28,837
I wouldn't have
recognized anyone.

1770
01:28:28,871 --> 01:28:31,440
POPO: We haven't changed
that much, have we?

1771
01:28:32,074 --> 01:28:34,843
Hmm... Just your hair.

1772
01:28:34,877 --> 01:28:36,379
(CHUCKLES)

1773
01:28:36,412 --> 01:28:38,080
My hair and your nose.

1774
01:28:39,047 --> 01:28:41,617
EPPIE: (LAUGHS)
Very funny.

1775
01:28:42,685 --> 01:28:45,354
Mmm. What a wonderful night.

1776
01:28:46,489 --> 01:28:47,623
My feet are sore.

1777
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:49,425
POPO: Yeah, and cold, too.

1778
01:28:50,426 --> 01:28:51,760
I'm sorry.

1779
01:28:52,928 --> 01:28:55,664
You know, I haven't
danced like that
in years.

1780
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:59,702
Well, sissy,
we've still got it.

1781
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:03,539
Well, at least I have.

1782
01:29:08,110 --> 01:29:10,078
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1783
01:29:15,017 --> 01:29:15,951
Oh...
