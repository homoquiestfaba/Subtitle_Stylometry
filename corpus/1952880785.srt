1
00:00:48,213 --> 00:00:51,649
Some people say
that fairies are the stuff of fantasy.

2
00:00:52,173 --> 00:00:56,928
They think the world is just
what you can touch and hear and see,

3
00:00:57,053 --> 00:01:00,523
while others say the tales and legends
cannot be dismissed.

4
00:01:01,173 --> 00:01:05,610
They believe with all their hearts
that fairies truly do exist.

5
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:11,685
Throughout all time,
human beings and fairies never met,

6
00:01:12,653 --> 00:01:17,773
till one very special summer
that we shall not soon forget.

7
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:34,524
Life is rising up
Surging forth in all directions

8
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:40,205
Every little buttercup
Is reaching out to find connections

9
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:43,245
Every blade of grass
Will touch the sunlight

10
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,533
The rain will touch the ground

11
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:51,284
Growing greener than it was before

12
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:58,685
Bees are droning by
Spider silk is softly spinning

13
00:01:58,813 --> 00:02:04,251
Not a cloud in the sky
You know it's only the beginning

14
00:02:04,493 --> 00:02:10,762
Every little blossom, every flower
Flings its petals wide

15
00:02:10,893 --> 00:02:15,330
As the season comes round
Once more

16
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:19,326
Hey, Tink! You ready
for your first summer on the mainland?

17
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:22,365
Absolutely! It's so beautiful out here.

18
00:02:22,573 --> 00:02:24,848
I can't believe we get to stay
for the whole season.

19
00:02:25,373 --> 00:02:28,126
Well, what are we waiting for?
Race you down!

20
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:35,323
The breeze is blowing light and sweet
The grass, a carpet at your feet

21
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:39,492
Catch the colours
Feel the heat of the sun

22
00:02:41,573 --> 00:02:47,409
All the sparrows in the dell
Swirling round like a carousel

23
00:02:47,653 --> 00:02:51,248
Singing loud enough to tell everyone

24
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:52,328
Hi, guys.

25
00:02:52,453 --> 00:02:54,091
Summer's just begun

26
00:02:58,173 --> 00:02:59,925
Summer's just begun

27
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:05,521
There it is, Tink. Fairy camp!

28
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:08,451
All the winters, all the springs

29
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,532
Lead us here on fairy wings

30
00:03:11,653 --> 00:03:15,612
A season of a thousand things
To be done

31
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:17,851
Summer's just begun

32
00:03:22,413 --> 00:03:24,210
Summer's just begun

33
00:03:27,213 --> 00:03:28,407
Hiya, Cheese!

34
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:29,727
Summer's just begun

35
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:32,413
- Did you have a nice flight?
- Incoming!

36
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:35,809
- Keep her level! Keep her level!
- Gear it down, Bobble!

37
00:03:37,413 --> 00:03:40,132
- Smashing landing, Clanky.
- Thank you, Bobble.

38
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,892
Guys, I think you may
have over-packed.

39
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:45,886
- Come on, Tink. Let's go inside.
- Inside?

40
00:03:46,453 --> 00:03:49,206
Tink, fairy camp isn't out here
in the open.

41
00:03:49,373 --> 00:03:51,170
We need to stay hidden
from the humans.

42
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:53,090
- We do?
- Yeah.

43
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:55,643
That's why fairy camp is in here.

44
00:04:03,413 --> 00:04:07,770
Cicadas, one at a time.
You, you and you. You, too.

45
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:12,692
Wow. It's like all of Pixie Hollow
under one tree!

46
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:26,688
Blaze!

47
00:04:54,413 --> 00:04:57,246
Wow! The Queen Anne's lace
is looking beautiful.

48
00:04:57,373 --> 00:05:00,331
- How are the looms working?
- Fine, thanks to you, Tink.

49
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:05,004
Next. Next. Next.

50
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:08,443
- How's the bee-liner working?
- Like a dream, Tink. Thanks.

51
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:12,282
- Great. Need any help with that wagon?
- No, thanks. She's running fine.

52
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,165
Okay. Glad to hear it.

53
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:17,444
Here's the first week's supply.

54
00:05:17,573 --> 00:05:21,612
Okay, I'm off. I gotta go deliver
pixie dust to the other fairy camps,

55
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:24,008
but I'll see you in a couple days.

56
00:05:24,253 --> 00:05:27,723
And Tink! Don't worry.
You'll find something to fix.

57
00:05:29,693 --> 00:05:30,921
I hope so.

58
00:05:31,213 --> 00:05:33,568
In the meantime,
I need to go find some lost things.

59
00:05:33,693 --> 00:05:35,684
Hold on, little miss spare parts.

60
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:38,691
You're not going near
the human house, are you?

61
00:05:39,013 --> 00:05:42,688
- There's a human house?
- No! I mean, yes, but no.

62
00:05:42,813 --> 00:05:45,407
- We stay away from humans.
- Iridessa!

63
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:52,126
- Tinker Bell knows that, don't you?
- Define "stay away."

64
00:05:52,973 --> 00:05:55,487
- It's gonna be a long summer.
- Grouchy.

65
00:05:56,493 --> 00:06:01,726
- That's just Vidia being Vidia.
- No, the air. It smells grouchy.

66
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,052
- We might be in for a storm.
- Come on, Sil.

67
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:10,009
The sun is shining, the air is warm.
It's a beautiful day. Nothing's gonna...

68
00:06:57,253 --> 00:06:58,481
Tinker Bell.

69
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:14,082
Thank goodness we're here, Father.
It's just like I remember it.

70
00:07:14,213 --> 00:07:15,931
Well, of course, my darling.

71
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:18,647
Look at the creek and the woods
and the meadow!

72
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:22,208
I wish it was summer all year long!

73
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:24,567
Yes, Lizzy.

74
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:49,847
Tinker Bell, what are you doing here?

75
00:07:49,973 --> 00:07:53,852
Vidia, this is amazing!
It's a carriage that moves by itself!

76
00:07:54,253 --> 00:07:56,084
There's no horse. Seriously, look.

77
00:07:56,213 --> 00:07:58,204
- Do you see a horse up there?
- No.

78
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:02,212
It's a horseless carriage!
And do you want to know how it works?

79
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,005
- Not really.
- So do I.

80
00:08:04,253 --> 00:08:08,246
I think those wheels back there move
because this chain thing rotates.

81
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:11,201
And I think what rotates the chain
is this big...

82
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,848
I don't care, Tinker Bell. You shouldn't
be this close to the human house.

83
00:08:14,973 --> 00:08:16,611
What if they see us?

84
00:08:19,853 --> 00:08:23,209
Will you stop flitting around in there?
This is serious!

85
00:08:23,773 --> 00:08:27,209
You know what, Vidia?
I think this powers the whole thing!

86
00:08:30,053 --> 00:08:35,207
This, my dear, is exactly why tinkers
shouldn't come to the mainland. They...

87
00:08:36,773 --> 00:08:38,172
Let me know if this does anything.

88
00:08:41,573 --> 00:08:44,804
Well, anything? Vidia, you're all wet.

89
00:08:46,213 --> 00:08:47,612
You don't say.

90
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:50,964
Father, Father, Father! Can we
bring our tea and scones outside

91
00:08:51,093 --> 00:08:52,492
and have them here in the garden?

92
00:08:52,613 --> 00:08:55,047
- It would be just like a little picnic.
- Not just now, Lizzy.

93
00:08:55,173 --> 00:08:57,733
I still have to get the trunk unpacked
and the house settled.

94
00:08:57,853 --> 00:09:00,890
Father, look!
What a magnificent butterfly.

95
00:09:03,013 --> 00:09:07,404
My word. Absolutely astonishing.

96
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:10,445
It's so beautiful.
What kind of butterfly is it?

97
00:09:11,053 --> 00:09:14,887
Well, judging from the epidermal
membrane, it's clearly an apatura iris,

98
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:18,244
but the wings
have two entirely different patterns.

99
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:20,724
Well, that's nearly impossible.

100
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:24,323
Well, I guess that's just the way
the fairies decided to paint it.

101
00:09:24,453 --> 00:09:27,206
Lizzy, fairies do not paint
butterfly wings

102
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:30,725
because, as you know,
fairies are not real.

103
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:32,613
But of course they are.
The proof is right here.

104
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,171
But of course they are.
The proof is right here.

105
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,689
- Their paint dripped all over its wing.
- Really, darling.

106
00:09:37,813 --> 00:09:41,601
Rational people consider
a belief in fairies to be quite foolish.

107
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:44,090
- The wings are so fresh.
- What are you doing?

108
00:09:44,213 --> 00:09:46,169
Its chrysalis must have been
in the meadow.

109
00:09:46,293 --> 00:09:48,853
The meadow? Father, wait!

110
00:09:50,613 --> 00:09:53,366
That's where I'm going.
Would you like to come?

111
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,529
Not now, Lizzy.
I have to update my field journal.

112
00:09:55,653 --> 00:09:58,121
My interview at the museum
is tomorrow night.

113
00:09:58,253 --> 00:10:01,404
You're going back already?
We just got here.

114
00:10:02,453 --> 00:10:06,731
I know, sweetheart, and I'm very sorry.
But I'll only be gone for the day.

115
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:10,846
Mrs Perkins will look after you,
and I'll be back in time to tuck you in.

116
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:13,203
- Promise?
- I promise.

117
00:10:14,773 --> 00:10:16,889
- Okay.
- That's a good girl.

118
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:28,721
All clear!

119
00:10:30,373 --> 00:10:31,772
Come on, Vidia.

120
00:10:31,893 --> 00:10:36,091
- I can't fly. My wings are wet.
- That's right. Sorry.

121
00:10:37,173 --> 00:10:39,323
Guess you'll have to walk back.

122
00:10:40,493 --> 00:10:44,486
But don't worry, I'll keep you company.
Actually, it might be nice.

123
00:10:48,293 --> 00:10:51,729
Or not.
So, I think I figured out the carriage.

124
00:10:52,093 --> 00:10:54,004
Those bottles of goop
must keep it running smoothly,

125
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:56,089
like snail slime, you know?

126
00:10:56,253 --> 00:10:59,529
Hate to see the size of the snail
that stuff comes from. And at first...

127
00:11:36,253 --> 00:11:39,370
Here's your house, little fairies.
Wherever you are.

128
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:45,448
Just needs a little something more.

129
00:11:48,613 --> 00:11:52,083
But I haven't quite figured out
what that sparky wire does.

130
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:55,683
Hey! Maybe the whole carriage
runs on lightning!

131
00:11:58,853 --> 00:12:02,971
Are those wet wings still bugging you?
Here, Vidia, let me help you.

132
00:12:04,453 --> 00:12:08,082
Tinker Bell, maybe if you spent
less time causing disasters,

133
00:12:08,213 --> 00:12:11,683
you wouldn't have
to help everybody so much.

134
00:12:13,853 --> 00:12:17,766
- The truth hurts, doesn't it?
- Look! We can use these back at camp!

135
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:22,402
Wow. These'll be perfect for the new
wagon prototype I've been working on.

136
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,206
Here. I bet if I took two or three
and tied them together,

137
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,767
I could make one really strong wheel!

138
00:12:27,893 --> 00:12:31,806
It's a good thing we were walking
or we might never have seen these.

139
00:12:31,973 --> 00:12:34,009
Vidia, where are your buttons?

140
00:12:34,493 --> 00:12:38,327
Tinker Bell, I am not carrying
this human junk back to camp.

141
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,771
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

142
00:12:52,093 --> 00:12:56,132
Tinker Bell, we're not supposed
to go near human houses.

143
00:12:56,253 --> 00:12:58,813
This isn't a human house.
They're a lot bigger.

144
00:12:58,933 --> 00:13:01,401
Besides, the sign says,
"Fairies welcome."

145
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:04,047
Who do you think wrote it? Humans!

146
00:13:06,173 --> 00:13:08,687
Tinker Bell, you're not going in there.

147
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:13,843
Please tell me you're not going in there!
She went in there.

148
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:22,722
Wow.

149
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,329
Tinker Bell! Don't eat that!
This could be a trap.

150
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:37,368
Come on, Vidia. It's perfectly safe.

151
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,802
Really?

152
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:47,324
- Vidia.
- Not so safe now, is it?

153
00:13:47,813 --> 00:13:50,452
Nice try, Vidia,
but you're not scaring me.

154
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:52,086
Gosh, this thing is amazing.

155
00:13:52,213 --> 00:13:54,807
You just don't know when to stop,
do you?

156
00:13:57,773 --> 00:14:00,162
Oh, no. Tink! Someone's coming!

157
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:03,291
The door is stuck!

158
00:14:03,453 --> 00:14:05,364
Come on, Vidia.
You can do better than that.

159
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:07,688
- Tink!
- I wonder what this part does.

160
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,611
Tink! I'm serious! Get out of there!

161
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:12,530
Just a second. Just a second.

162
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:25,211
Vidia? Vidia?

163
00:14:28,653 --> 00:14:31,850
Vidia, come on. Open the door.
You had your little...

164
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:38,927
Oh, no. What have I done?

165
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:42,684
Vidia? Okay, not funny any more.

166
00:14:49,093 --> 00:14:50,572
A fairy!

167
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,807
It's a real fairy!

168
00:15:02,053 --> 00:15:04,089
Father! Father!

169
00:15:10,053 --> 00:15:11,168
Father!

170
00:15:21,973 --> 00:15:24,362
- Father! Father, Father!
- Yes, Lizzy.

171
00:15:24,693 --> 00:15:26,411
You're never going to believe
what I found.

172
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:30,208
- Maybe later, Lizzy.
- But Father, Father, Father,

173
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,925
- Father, Father.
- Just a moment, dear.

174
00:15:32,053 --> 00:15:34,806
- I'm very busy with my project.
- Yes, but Father!

175
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:36,332
- Father!
- Lizzy, please.

176
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:39,968
I must add this extraordinary discovery
to my field journal.

177
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:41,532
And here it is.

178
00:15:43,053 --> 00:15:45,567
Is that the butterfly
we were looking at earlier?

179
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:48,253
Yes. Quite a specimen, isn't it?

180
00:15:48,373 --> 00:15:50,409
You're not going to take it to London,
are you?

181
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,172
Yes, of course. The board of trustees
would never believe me

182
00:15:53,293 --> 00:15:54,408
if they didn't see it themselves.

183
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:57,047
Now I'm sure to get that curatorship
at the museum.

184
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:59,209
Besides, as a member
of the scientific community,

185
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:03,121
I'm obligated to share significant
findings like this with my colleagues.

186
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:07,292
I know it's unfortunate for the specimen,
but really, there is no other way.

187
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:09,404
Now, dear.
What did you want me to see?

188
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:11,921
Never mind.

189
00:16:34,213 --> 00:16:35,885
Where have you gone?

190
00:16:50,373 --> 00:16:53,570
Mr Twitches, no! Out! Out with you!

191
00:16:57,093 --> 00:16:58,651
Mr Twitches!

192
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:06,327
Bad cat! No, no, no!

193
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:11,890
Don't worry, little fairy.

194
00:17:12,013 --> 00:17:15,369
Mr Twitches won't bother you
as long as you're in there.

195
00:17:16,053 --> 00:17:18,806
Naughty cat! You're going outside.

196
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:36,446
Tinker Bell's
been captured by humans!

197
00:18:37,773 --> 00:18:38,922
- Oh, no.
- What happened? Is she okay?

198
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:40,202
- Is she all right?
- What's this? Tinker Bell?

199
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,686
- What happened, Vidia?
- Is she hurt?

200
00:18:41,813 --> 00:18:45,169
Tinker Bell went into this little house
in the meadow and couldn't get out.

201
00:18:45,293 --> 00:18:46,965
The door got jammed.

202
00:18:47,253 --> 00:18:49,847
Then this human came from out
of nowhere and snatched her up,

203
00:18:49,973 --> 00:18:52,726
but I know where she is.
We have to hurry and save her.

204
00:18:52,853 --> 00:18:55,003
Then we better leave right away!

205
00:18:59,413 --> 00:19:01,210
Sil, do you think the storm
will pass soon?

206
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,767
No, it looks like it's gonna get stronger.

207
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,849
Well, there's gotta be some way
to get to Tink.

208
00:19:05,973 --> 00:19:08,806
We can't fly in the rain,
and the meadow's already flooded.

209
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:10,571
Maybe we don't have to fly.

210
00:19:10,693 --> 00:19:14,572
If we get some big leaves and sew them
together with stem twine...

211
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:16,924
And mitre-cut some twigs
for the sub-flooring.

212
00:19:17,053 --> 00:19:18,327
Acorns as counterweights.

213
00:19:18,453 --> 00:19:20,648
Some quick-dry maple sap
as reinforcement.

214
00:19:20,773 --> 00:19:22,172
What are you two talking about?

215
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:25,205
- We're gonna build a boat!
- We're gonna build a boat!

216
00:19:33,893 --> 00:19:37,522
- More mushroom caps, please!
- Here we go.

217
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:43,089
This one goes there.
That one goes there. Right?

218
00:19:44,493 --> 00:19:46,211
Righty-o, Bobble.

219
00:19:58,973 --> 00:20:02,010
- Right, more reeds over here.
- This thing had better work.

220
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:06,172
Give me the sap. You dip it in this way
and give it a big slap like so.

221
00:20:11,173 --> 00:20:13,482
Come on. Come on. Let's get going.

222
00:20:15,973 --> 00:20:18,203
There you go. Now you're talking!

223
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,326
It's working!

224
00:20:34,373 --> 00:20:35,726
Well, this is it.

225
00:20:38,973 --> 00:20:40,406
Hey, faith...

226
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:41,922
Trust...

227
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:43,532
- And pixie dust.
- Pixie dust.

228
00:20:49,613 --> 00:20:51,331
Come on. Come on.

229
00:20:57,693 --> 00:20:58,808
Hello.

230
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:06,328
You don't have to be scared.
I'm very nice.

231
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:11,446
You're so little.

232
00:21:12,093 --> 00:21:15,847
Your dress is very leafy.
Did you make it yourself?

233
00:21:16,613 --> 00:21:19,571
I like your wings.
They're like sparkly lace.

234
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:22,010
Your hair must be so soft.

235
00:21:24,253 --> 00:21:28,565
Are you hungry? Maybe not.
That's okay.

236
00:21:28,813 --> 00:21:31,202
I don't like some kinds of food, either.

237
00:21:34,213 --> 00:21:37,046
I'm so sorry. Where are my manners?

238
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:39,886
There you go.

239
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:52,132
Wait! Wait! Wait! No, please!
I'm not going to hurt you!

240
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:57,612
Don't be afraid!
I just want to be your friend!

241
00:21:59,573 --> 00:22:04,169
I really won't hurt you. I just love fairies.

242
00:22:05,373 --> 00:22:08,126
I've been drawing fairies
all my life. See?

243
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:13,086
I drew that one when I was three,
but I did that green one last week.

244
00:22:14,253 --> 00:22:16,130
I think it's much better.

245
00:22:16,773 --> 00:22:20,288
I even started to paint
with the watercolours Father gave me.

246
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:24,766
Is it true that some fairies
paint butterfly wings?

247
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:28,761
I knew it!

248
00:22:29,453 --> 00:22:31,921
These are some
of my favourite drawings.

249
00:22:32,173 --> 00:22:33,606
This is a water fairy.

250
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:36,770
- You can tell because her skin is blue.
- Blue?

251
00:22:37,013 --> 00:22:40,085
And here is a candy fairy
living in a lollipop tree.

252
00:22:40,213 --> 00:22:42,044
Do all fairies live in trees
made of sweets?

253
00:22:44,653 --> 00:22:47,645
Really? What about fairy circles?

254
00:22:49,813 --> 00:22:52,327
Well, I hear
that if a person steps in one,

255
00:22:52,453 --> 00:22:55,923
a fairy has to grant them three wishes
from their magic bag.

256
00:22:56,693 --> 00:23:00,129
But if they don't,
they turn into a pile of delicious sugar,

257
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,811
- and then younger fairies...
- Wait. Wait a minute.

258
00:23:01,933 --> 00:23:06,085
...must try and turn them back into...
- Where are you getting all this?

259
00:23:06,773 --> 00:23:09,810
You jingle when you talk,
like a little bell!

260
00:23:10,093 --> 00:23:12,129
So that's how fairies speak.

261
00:23:13,813 --> 00:23:17,089
So what do you think of my fairies?
And my fairy house!

262
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,210
It got a little shaken up.

263
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:30,689
- Did you make this?
- I don't know what you're saying.

264
00:23:36,773 --> 00:23:40,732
Did I make the fairy house? Yes, I did.
Do you like it?

265
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:46,531
The door's stuck.

266
00:23:53,253 --> 00:23:56,245
Well, you're quite the little tinker,
aren't you?

267
00:23:56,613 --> 00:23:59,923
What? Is that your name? Tinker?

268
00:24:03,293 --> 00:24:06,091
Bell? Your name is Bell.

269
00:24:08,893 --> 00:24:11,248
Tinker? Bell?

270
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:16,523
Tinker Bell? Tinker Bell.

271
00:24:17,773 --> 00:24:22,767
What a lovely name!
Well, Tinker Bell, my name's Lizzy.

272
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,852
Do all fairies sound the same
when they talk?

273
00:24:29,973 --> 00:24:33,761
How do you learn to be a fairy?
Do you go to fairy school?

274
00:24:33,893 --> 00:24:38,569
Lizzy? Lizzy? Who are you talking to?

275
00:24:42,453 --> 00:24:43,647
My fairy!

276
00:24:45,613 --> 00:24:49,891
That's nice, dear. Now, I brought you
something I think you'll really enjoy.

277
00:24:50,013 --> 00:24:53,210
These are some
of my old field journals.

278
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:56,088
Now, I picked out the ones
I thought would excite you the most.

279
00:24:56,213 --> 00:25:00,331
This one on rocks and minerals
is particularly interesting.

280
00:25:00,573 --> 00:25:04,771
- Is there a field journal about fairies?
- Of course not, Lizzy.

281
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:08,769
Books like this are based on fact
and scientific research,

282
00:25:09,453 --> 00:25:12,411
which is quite the contrary
to your little figurines and drawings.

283
00:25:12,533 --> 00:25:16,412
Well, just because you've never seen
a fairy doesn't mean they're not real.

284
00:25:16,533 --> 00:25:22,449
Now, Lizzy, seeing is believing,
and without proof, it's just a fairy tale.

285
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:27,887
Now, here is a blank field journal.
Now, you're very talented, my darling,

286
00:25:28,453 --> 00:25:32,526
and I'm sure you'll be able to fill it
with your own scientific research.

287
00:25:32,653 --> 00:25:33,927
Yes, Father.

288
00:25:37,413 --> 00:25:40,007
Now if only these leaks
were just pretend.

289
00:25:42,013 --> 00:25:44,288
Tinker Bell, you can come out now.

290
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:53,565
Look, Lizzy, thanks for showing me
your collection, but I really should be...

291
00:25:55,653 --> 00:25:57,086
You want to go?

292
00:25:58,813 --> 00:26:00,724
I really wish you'd stay.

293
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,012
I'm sorry, Lizzy.

294
00:26:04,293 --> 00:26:06,443
Okay, I understand.

295
00:26:13,933 --> 00:26:15,924
So, I guess this is goodbye.

296
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:22,529
What's wrong?
Can't you fly in the rain?

297
00:26:25,613 --> 00:26:27,922
You can stay with me
until the rain stops.

298
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:31,329
I'll show you around my room.
We can play with my toys.

299
00:26:31,453 --> 00:26:33,205
We'll have so much fun.

300
00:26:40,013 --> 00:26:43,722
- We're past the shallows!
- Aye! Drop the mainsail!

301
00:26:44,013 --> 00:26:45,731
Dropping the mainsail!

302
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:48,808
- Trim the sail!
- Trimming the sail!

303
00:26:52,893 --> 00:26:58,092
- Big thingy, dead ahead! Hard to port!
- Hard to port! Hard to port!

304
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:07,886
I recognise that wagon.
Stay on this course!

305
00:27:08,173 --> 00:27:11,722
- Aye, Miss Vidia. Will do.
- I sure hope Tink is all right.

306
00:27:11,973 --> 00:27:15,283
Who knows what terrible things
could be happening to her right now.

307
00:27:17,733 --> 00:27:19,883
A fairy could get used to this.

308
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:24,689
Isn't it wonderful? Everything in this
house is just your size, Tinker Bell.

309
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:29,452
That's perfume. It smells like flowers.

310
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:33,801
My doll. She should be in bed by now.

311
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:37,009
How old are you? I'm nine.

312
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:42,521
Do you like my dollhouse?
Do fairies live in houses?

313
00:27:43,853 --> 00:27:46,128
What are fairies' houses made of?

314
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:49,406
That's a cooker,
but it doesn't actually work.

315
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:53,082
What's your favourite food?
I mean, besides sweets?

316
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,971
I want to know all about real live fairies.

317
00:28:03,893 --> 00:28:05,042
Perfect!

318
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:11,570
"Scientific fairy research."

319
00:28:12,653 --> 00:28:14,928
Okay. What's your favourite colour?

320
00:28:17,493 --> 00:28:19,688
Green is my favourite colour, too!

321
00:28:21,373 --> 00:28:25,002
I should start from the beginning.
Where do fairies come from?

322
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:27,124
I mean, where were you born?

323
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:31,370
Well, that one's
a little more complicated because...

324
00:28:31,773 --> 00:28:33,570
So, a baby, when it laughs
for the first time...

325
00:28:36,293 --> 00:28:37,521
A fairy...

326
00:28:40,733 --> 00:28:43,372
Right. One second.

327
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:51,208
You were a funny-looking baby?

328
00:28:54,173 --> 00:28:55,288
A baby?

329
00:28:58,253 --> 00:28:59,208
Laughs?

330
00:29:02,453 --> 00:29:03,442
One?

331
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:07,282
First?

332
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:13,768
When a baby laughs for the first time,
that's when a fairy is born.

333
00:29:16,293 --> 00:29:17,567
Incredible.

334
00:29:19,093 --> 00:29:21,323
Lizzy, that's only the beginning.

335
00:29:21,813 --> 00:29:24,611
Guess I always knew

336
00:29:25,653 --> 00:29:28,451
This could all come true

337
00:29:29,493 --> 00:29:32,405
Still it feels so new

338
00:29:33,253 --> 00:29:36,131
Being here with you

339
00:29:37,093 --> 00:29:40,085
Can't believe my eyes

340
00:29:40,893 --> 00:29:44,169
A new world comes alive

341
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:48,526
Spring and summer
Love and laughter

342
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:52,043
We'll live happy ever after

343
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:56,844
We'll shine brighter
Than we thought we'd be

344
00:29:56,973 --> 00:30:02,969
Because you showed me
How to believe

345
00:30:09,693 --> 00:30:12,412
More than just pretend

346
00:30:13,373 --> 00:30:15,841
I'll make believe again

347
00:30:17,173 --> 00:30:20,131
I hope this never ends

348
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:23,813
Maybe we'll be friends

349
00:30:24,613 --> 00:30:28,652
Now everything I know
Everything I know

350
00:30:28,773 --> 00:30:32,448
I'll never let it go
Never let it go

351
00:30:32,573 --> 00:30:36,452
Spring and summer
Love and laughter

352
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:40,248
We'll live happy ever after

353
00:30:40,373 --> 00:30:44,764
We'll shine brighter
Than we thought we'd be

354
00:30:44,973 --> 00:30:51,128
Because you showed me
How to believe

355
00:31:02,453 --> 00:31:04,409
Okay, everybody, listen up.

356
00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:08,090
This road should take us straight
to the human house.

357
00:31:08,293 --> 00:31:11,365
So how far is it from the road
to the house, do you think?

358
00:31:11,493 --> 00:31:15,566
Not that far, really.
The only question is, how flooded is it?

359
00:31:15,893 --> 00:31:17,565
That's a good point.

360
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:21,528
Well, I'm gonna remain optimistic.

361
00:31:22,053 --> 00:31:25,090
- We'll get to Tink in no time.
- I'm with you, Sil.

362
00:31:27,213 --> 00:31:28,441
We're almost there.

363
00:31:28,573 --> 00:31:31,212
Why, look,
we're picking up speed already.

364
00:31:31,653 --> 00:31:34,121
Did you feel that? We're moving faster.

365
00:31:39,053 --> 00:31:42,682
Hey, guys!
We're heading right for a waterfall!

366
00:31:46,373 --> 00:31:49,012
Great polliwogs!
We have to make the turn!

367
00:31:49,293 --> 00:31:51,761
Ease the sheets and get ready to jibe!

368
00:31:52,773 --> 00:31:53,728
- What?
- What?

369
00:31:53,853 --> 00:31:56,890
Ease the sheet and get ready to jibe!

370
00:31:57,013 --> 00:31:58,082
- What?
- What did he say?

371
00:31:58,213 --> 00:32:01,762
Loosen the ropes and turn the sail!

372
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,125
- Oh, no!
- Look out!

373
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,452
Man overboard!

374
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:13,924
Hard to port! Hard to port!

375
00:32:15,493 --> 00:32:17,563
Turn the boat! Turn the boat!

376
00:32:20,573 --> 00:32:22,882
Guys! We're running out of river!

377
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:27,366
That's all right,
'cause all we need's a little.

378
00:32:27,493 --> 00:32:30,007
- Rosetta, come grab my feet.
- What?

379
00:32:33,933 --> 00:32:36,493
Hang on! We're going straight down!

380
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:39,088
Oh, no!

381
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,606
Brace yourselves!

382
00:33:04,613 --> 00:33:08,322
- Who's alive?
- Not me.

383
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:12,729
Me, either. I can't find a pulse!
It's not there!

384
00:33:12,973 --> 00:33:16,045
I'm telling you, I don't... I'm good.

385
00:33:23,053 --> 00:33:24,168
Sorry!

386
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:28,243
Looks like we're walking from here.

387
00:33:28,813 --> 00:33:32,692
- But... Walking where?
- We could be anywhere.

388
00:33:33,373 --> 00:33:35,967
Everything looks the same
from down here.

389
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:39,211
And there's no way of knowing
which way to go.

390
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:41,767
Clank! Where did you find that?

391
00:33:43,013 --> 00:33:46,403
I don't know. Here on the ground.
Is it yours?

392
00:33:56,053 --> 00:33:57,725
I know where we are.

393
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:04,482
Tinker Bell, this is so fascinating.
Thank you.

394
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:09,007
I had no idea fairies were responsible
for changing the seasons.

395
00:34:09,653 --> 00:34:12,121
I thought it had something to do
with the Earth's axis

396
00:34:12,253 --> 00:34:16,326
- as it rotated around the sun.
- That's what we wanted you to think.

397
00:34:17,053 --> 00:34:22,207
Well, I think we've covered everything.
I hope Father's impressed.

398
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:25,123
And now, for the finale.

399
00:34:26,293 --> 00:34:29,126
The whole fairy land, Pixie Hollow.

400
00:34:33,453 --> 00:34:37,605
It worked!
Tinker Bell, I can't wait to show Father.

401
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:43,849
Tinker Bell? Are you all right?
Tinker Bell?

402
00:34:45,373 --> 00:34:48,331
Sorry. Yeah, let's go show your dad.

403
00:35:01,653 --> 00:35:04,042
Looks like the rain has let up some.

404
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:07,053
You might be able to make it home
to your friends now.

405
00:35:11,613 --> 00:35:13,524
Maybe this could help you.

406
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,568
Yes.

407
00:35:24,173 --> 00:35:25,845
Such a clever tinker.

408
00:35:30,013 --> 00:35:31,731
Take care of yourself.

409
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:43,688
I'll never forget you, Tinker Bell.

410
00:35:47,653 --> 00:35:51,248
You'd best hurry. The break
in the weather may not last long.

411
00:36:09,213 --> 00:36:10,168
Goodbye.

412
00:36:16,253 --> 00:36:18,528
And I'll never forget you, Lizzy.

413
00:36:23,293 --> 00:36:26,285
- Father, look!
- Not just now, Lizzy.

414
00:36:26,413 --> 00:36:28,290
My hands are rather full at the moment.

415
00:36:28,413 --> 00:36:32,486
I made it especially for you, Father.
It's just like your field journal.

416
00:36:32,613 --> 00:36:35,127
- It's filled with lots of facts.
- Yes, yes, that sounds wonderful,

417
00:36:35,253 --> 00:36:37,813
but I'm in the middle
of a potential catastrophe here.

418
00:36:37,933 --> 00:36:39,161
I can't look at it now.

419
00:36:39,293 --> 00:36:42,410
- But Father, it's a field journal, and I...
- I don't have time.

420
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,922
I have to find some way
to deal with all these leaks

421
00:36:45,053 --> 00:36:46,771
before they destroy my work.

422
00:36:46,893 --> 00:36:51,762
- When will you be able to look at it?
- I don't know. Maybe later.

423
00:36:52,893 --> 00:36:54,565
You always say that.

424
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:43,248
Tinker Bell!

425
00:37:45,693 --> 00:37:49,322
You came back! I'm so glad to see you.

426
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:56,209
Tinker Bell, Father has no time
for the field journal.

427
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:01,365
I think I can fix that.

428
00:38:03,613 --> 00:38:05,922
Vidia, you sure you know
where you're going?

429
00:38:06,053 --> 00:38:10,126
Yes. Tinker Bell and I walked by here.
I just have to find the road.

430
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,892
Road? What road?

431
00:38:14,213 --> 00:38:15,487
That road!

432
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:19,885
That's not a road. That's a muddy river.

433
00:38:20,013 --> 00:38:22,447
So, I guess we need to find a bridge.

434
00:38:23,373 --> 00:38:25,841
Or be spontaneous and jump right in.

435
00:38:26,493 --> 00:38:28,802
It's not deep. We can walk across.

436
00:38:31,013 --> 00:38:33,652
Yeah, no. I don't really do mud.

437
00:38:34,693 --> 00:38:39,084
- But you're a garden fairy!
- Ironic, isn't it?

438
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:40,368
- Rosetta!
- Rosetta!

439
00:38:40,493 --> 00:38:42,484
Okay, all right. I'm coming.

440
00:38:46,973 --> 00:38:50,045
It's squishy. What was that?

441
00:38:57,613 --> 00:38:58,807
She's stuck!

442
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:01,488
I can get myself out of here.

443
00:39:04,253 --> 00:39:05,652
All right, all right.

444
00:39:05,773 --> 00:39:08,082
Someone just get me something
to grab onto.

445
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:12,764
- Got it! Clanky, rescue device.
- Right, Bobble. You can count on us!

446
00:39:14,493 --> 00:39:16,927
Okay. Let's give this a try.

447
00:39:20,693 --> 00:39:22,888
Do you feel that?
She's starting to break free.

448
00:39:23,013 --> 00:39:24,492
I don't think so.

449
00:39:28,893 --> 00:39:31,566
- Come on, hurry!
- Pull! Pull!

450
00:39:33,533 --> 00:39:34,568
Pull!

451
00:39:41,453 --> 00:39:42,442
Pull!

452
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:58,811
Hello? Is somebody out there?

453
00:40:01,053 --> 00:40:02,122
Anyone?

454
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:08,766
- Grab this! Hurry!
- Are you kidding me?

455
00:40:09,133 --> 00:40:11,044
Trust me. And hold on tight.

456
00:40:13,093 --> 00:40:14,287
Oh, well.

457
00:40:26,493 --> 00:40:27,892
We got the...

458
00:40:28,813 --> 00:40:32,726
...rescue device.
- You scared the petals right off of me!

459
00:40:34,253 --> 00:40:35,925
Did we miss anything?

460
00:40:37,293 --> 00:40:41,650
"My, what a splendid tea service.
I am really quite impressed."

461
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:46,485
Then I say,
"Why, thank you, Tinker Bell.

462
00:40:47,453 --> 00:40:49,091
"You are too kind."

463
00:40:50,093 --> 00:40:52,971
You hold your pinkie out, like this,

464
00:40:54,213 --> 00:41:00,448
and that's the way
you throw a proper tea party.

465
00:41:07,653 --> 00:41:09,211
Good night, Lizzy.

466
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:22,607
There we...

467
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:25,846
I'm going to bed.

468
00:41:35,253 --> 00:41:37,892
There just aren't enough hours
in the day.

469
00:43:59,133 --> 00:44:02,170
Good morning, Tinker Bell.
How did you sleep last night?

470
00:44:02,293 --> 00:44:05,968
Well, I... Actually, I didn't,
but that doesn't matter.

471
00:44:06,093 --> 00:44:08,653
You should go downstairs
to your father.

472
00:44:09,253 --> 00:44:11,244
- Lizzy?
- Yes, Father?

473
00:44:11,613 --> 00:44:15,083
Good morning, my dear.
All the leaks seem to have stopped.

474
00:44:15,533 --> 00:44:17,967
I just wanted to make sure
everything is okay in here.

475
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:23,246
Yes. Just fine. No leaks at all. So...

476
00:44:23,813 --> 00:44:26,486
Strange. It's as if
they mended themselves.

477
00:44:28,493 --> 00:44:30,211
It's still raining outside.

478
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:33,131
I can't imagine how on Earth
such a thing could occur.

479
00:44:35,253 --> 00:44:38,370
Well, there must be an explanation
that I'm just not thinking of.

480
00:44:38,493 --> 00:44:40,768
Well, I'm sure you'll think of it, Father.

481
00:44:40,893 --> 00:44:42,406
- Off we go.
- Perhaps down in your study.

482
00:44:42,533 --> 00:44:44,922
You always do your best thinking there.
I wish you luck.

483
00:44:45,053 --> 00:44:48,682
- Okay, well, play nicely.
- Yes, of course. Bye, Father.

484
00:44:51,653 --> 00:44:52,722
That was close.

485
00:44:52,973 --> 00:44:55,487
What are you doing?
This is your chance.

486
00:45:01,453 --> 00:45:04,047
Is that why you fixed those leaks?

487
00:45:06,053 --> 00:45:08,248
So he can spend more time with me?

488
00:45:10,493 --> 00:45:13,166
I've really been wanting
to show him this.

489
00:45:14,733 --> 00:45:16,564
Okay, okay. I'll go.

490
00:45:22,293 --> 00:45:24,249
Father, since you have more time,

491
00:45:24,373 --> 00:45:26,568
maybe I can show you
my scientific research.

492
00:45:26,693 --> 00:45:29,332
- The butterfly. It's gone!
- What?

493
00:45:29,653 --> 00:45:32,292
The apatura iris
with the irregular wing pattern.

494
00:45:32,413 --> 00:45:34,529
I was going to present it
to the museum tonight.

495
00:45:34,653 --> 00:45:38,009
This was my big opportunity,
and now it's gone.

496
00:45:39,053 --> 00:45:42,602
- Elizabeth, did you release it?
- No.

497
00:45:43,933 --> 00:45:45,605
Well, I didn't do it.

498
00:45:46,173 --> 00:45:47,925
And since there is no one else
in the house,

499
00:45:48,053 --> 00:45:50,521
there is only one logical explanation.

500
00:45:52,013 --> 00:45:54,925
- It must have been you.
- I didn't do it, Father.

501
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:59,412
I'm going to give you one more chance.
Tell me the truth.

502
00:46:01,013 --> 00:46:05,643
I could tell you, Father,
but you wouldn't believe me.

503
00:46:08,773 --> 00:46:14,370
Very well. Off to your room, young lady.
I'm very disappointed in you.

504
00:46:19,893 --> 00:46:22,885
You know, I was just thinking,
if Tink were here,

505
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:26,769
- how not quiet it would be right now.
- You can say that again.

506
00:46:26,893 --> 00:46:29,646
Okay, okay, okay. Who am I?

507
00:46:35,333 --> 00:46:37,130
That's the exact shade!

508
00:46:38,933 --> 00:46:41,447
Quite a bit of spirit
in that little tinker, eh?

509
00:46:41,573 --> 00:46:45,486
That's for sure. In fact,
I still can't believe she got captured.

510
00:46:45,613 --> 00:46:48,764
Yeah. It's very unlike Tink
to be caught with her guard down.

511
00:46:48,893 --> 00:46:52,010
- I wonder what really happened.
- Well, we'll find out soon.

512
00:46:52,133 --> 00:46:56,365
Yep. With every step we take we come
closer and closer to Tinker Bell.

513
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:58,610
She'll tell us what happened.

514
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:01,964
Listen, there's something
you all should know.

515
00:47:04,133 --> 00:47:05,930
Tinker Bell getting trapped
is all my fault!

516
00:47:07,373 --> 00:47:10,206
I slammed that door on Tinker Bell,
to teach her a lesson.

517
00:47:10,333 --> 00:47:12,608
I tried to get her out,
but the door was stuck.

518
00:47:12,733 --> 00:47:17,853
I tried, but I couldn't, and now
I've put her and all of us in danger.

519
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:21,289
I am so sorry.

520
00:47:25,053 --> 00:47:27,089
Honey, this is not your fault.

521
00:47:27,213 --> 00:47:30,285
We all know that Tink can get
into plenty of trouble all by herself.

522
00:47:30,413 --> 00:47:34,292
It scares me to think what would have
happened if you weren't there, Vidia.

523
00:47:34,413 --> 00:47:36,210
I don't know what to say.

524
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:39,848
- How about faith...
- Trust...

525
00:47:40,213 --> 00:47:41,487
- And...
- And...

526
00:47:41,613 --> 00:47:43,444
And pixie dust.

527
00:47:43,613 --> 00:47:45,490
- And pixie dust!
- And pixie dust!

528
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,490
Can you reach it, Clanky?

529
00:47:48,213 --> 00:47:50,886
- Almost. Just a little more.
- Here, let me.

530
00:47:51,733 --> 00:47:53,928
Okay. Now, can you see anything?

531
00:47:54,213 --> 00:47:57,285
No! There's a big building in the way.

532
00:47:57,853 --> 00:48:02,722
Building. It's a house. That's it!
Clanky! We've got it!

533
00:48:02,853 --> 00:48:04,969
- What've we got?
- House! Get off.

534
00:48:05,093 --> 00:48:07,163
- I'm sorry.
- I can't feel my legs.

535
00:48:11,773 --> 00:48:16,722
It doesn't matter what I say.
He never believes me.

536
00:48:18,693 --> 00:48:20,331
I'm so sorry, Lizzy.

537
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:25,364
I'm so glad you're here.

538
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,405
You're my best friend.

539
00:48:35,693 --> 00:48:38,605
I wish I were a fairy, just like you.

540
00:48:40,253 --> 00:48:43,165
Then I could help the flowers bloom
and talk to animals

541
00:48:43,293 --> 00:48:46,330
and fly around with the other fairies
all the time.

542
00:48:51,453 --> 00:48:53,011
That would be fun.

543
00:49:04,453 --> 00:49:06,045
Where are we going?

544
00:50:06,533 --> 00:50:08,251
What is going on up there?

545
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,208
I was going to present it
to the museum tonight.

546
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:27,005
Now the butterfly is gone.

547
00:50:48,813 --> 00:50:53,523
Oh, my! I'm... I'm flying!

548
00:50:57,293 --> 00:51:01,081
Look at me! I'm a fairy!

549
00:51:11,213 --> 00:51:12,441
All clear!

550
00:51:17,893 --> 00:51:19,212
- Sorry.
- Careful.

551
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:20,448
- That's my ear.
- Sorry.

552
00:51:20,573 --> 00:51:21,847
- Sorry.
- That's the nose. Careful.

553
00:51:21,973 --> 00:51:23,486
- Sorry.
- Can't see!

554
00:51:23,773 --> 00:51:27,322
Okay. Tinker Bell is upstairs.
The little girl has her in a cage.

555
00:51:27,933 --> 00:51:28,888
In a cage?

556
00:51:29,013 --> 00:51:30,765
And there's also a large human
in the house

557
00:51:30,893 --> 00:51:35,250
who doesn't like creatures with wings.
He pins them up in display cases.

558
00:51:36,013 --> 00:51:39,528
- Great. Anything else?
- Yes. The cat.

559
00:51:39,773 --> 00:51:41,331
Cat! What cat?

560
00:51:41,893 --> 00:51:43,565
- That cat!
- That cat!

561
00:51:47,573 --> 00:51:51,088
Fawn, you're an animal fairy.
What are we supposed to do?

562
00:51:52,973 --> 00:51:54,884
- Fawn?
- Fly!

563
00:51:55,013 --> 00:51:57,322
- Our wings are wet.
- And who knows when they'll be dry.

564
00:51:57,453 --> 00:51:59,125
Okay, okay. Run!

565
00:52:11,413 --> 00:52:13,369
- Clank!
- Come on!

566
00:52:17,613 --> 00:52:20,810
- Clank!
- I'm okay.

567
00:52:22,533 --> 00:52:25,252
We still need to get to that stairwell.
Any ideas?

568
00:52:25,373 --> 00:52:27,250
If we could just build a bridge
or something.

569
00:52:27,373 --> 00:52:30,092
- That's it. A bridge!
- Guys? Guys?

570
00:52:30,293 --> 00:52:32,568
- A bridge made out of what?
- Guys!

571
00:52:34,373 --> 00:52:36,250
Clank! You're a genius!

572
00:52:40,293 --> 00:52:41,487
It was nothing.

573
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:46,489
All right. Let's do this.

574
00:52:55,813 --> 00:53:00,045
- We need some more plates!
- Okay. Start passing them up, Clanky.

575
00:53:00,453 --> 00:53:03,763
Aye, aye! Here they come!

576
00:53:06,773 --> 00:53:09,367
Get ready for more. Hello!

577
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:13,289
We've got a full plate back here!

578
00:53:13,453 --> 00:53:16,923
No, no, no. No. No, please.

579
00:53:17,413 --> 00:53:18,368
Get back!

580
00:53:32,493 --> 00:53:33,528
Get back!

581
00:53:33,653 --> 00:53:36,565
Rosetta! Is this what I think it is?

582
00:53:37,053 --> 00:53:40,090
That is exactly
what you think it is. Catnip!

583
00:53:40,733 --> 00:53:43,122
You get to Tink
and we'll take care of the cat!

584
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:44,208
Got it!

585
00:54:01,573 --> 00:54:03,529
- Lizzy?
- Coming, Father!

586
00:54:03,933 --> 00:54:07,562
- Lizzy?
- Why, hello, Father. May I help you?

587
00:54:07,813 --> 00:54:09,883
- What's going on in here?
- Nothing.

588
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:13,972
Nothing? Sounds like a herd of
elephants have been marching up here.

589
00:54:15,893 --> 00:54:19,249
Look at this room.
It looks like a cyclone hit it.

590
00:54:20,013 --> 00:54:22,573
- It's not that bad.
- Not that bad?

591
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:25,927
Your books are all over the floor,
your toys are everywhere

592
00:54:26,053 --> 00:54:28,567
and you tore your curtains. What?

593
00:54:29,573 --> 00:54:32,292
How did you get footprints
on the ceiling?

594
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,366
This is simply too much.

595
00:54:34,493 --> 00:54:37,451
A temper tantrum of this magnitude
is unacceptable.

596
00:54:37,573 --> 00:54:39,211
But I wasn't having a tantrum!

597
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:42,325
Then how did this happen?
And the truth this time.

598
00:54:43,053 --> 00:54:47,126
If I tell you the truth,
you still won't believe me.

599
00:54:47,653 --> 00:54:49,325
Elizabeth, the truth.

600
00:54:50,813 --> 00:54:53,805
I was flying. My fairy showed me how.

601
00:54:53,933 --> 00:54:58,131
For goodness sake.
Your make-believe fairy did this?

602
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,369
You've got to stop this nonsense!

603
00:55:00,493 --> 00:55:02,882
But it's not nonsense, Father.
It's the truth!

604
00:55:03,013 --> 00:55:04,969
You have a real fairy
living in your room?

605
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,924
Yes! And I can prove it.

606
00:55:10,013 --> 00:55:12,243
Just look at the research we did.

607
00:55:16,693 --> 00:55:19,412
Elizabeth. This is what
you've been doing?

608
00:55:20,373 --> 00:55:23,604
Field journals are to be filled with fact,
not fairy tales.

609
00:55:23,733 --> 00:55:25,689
But Father, these are facts!

610
00:55:26,173 --> 00:55:29,688
I don't understand this foolishness,
Lizzy. You have such talent.

611
00:55:29,813 --> 00:55:34,682
- Why would you waste it this way?
- Why can't you just believe me?

612
00:55:34,813 --> 00:55:36,565
I believe in what is real,

613
00:55:36,693 --> 00:55:39,526
and it's about time
you started doing the same.

614
00:55:39,653 --> 00:55:41,006
Father, wait!

615
00:55:41,453 --> 00:55:44,092
I know this is difficult for you
to understand,

616
00:55:44,213 --> 00:55:46,647
but this is all make-believe.

617
00:55:46,773 --> 00:55:49,845
- No! They're real!
- Elizabeth, this discussion is over.

618
00:55:51,413 --> 00:55:52,687
But Father!

619
00:56:01,493 --> 00:56:04,166
It... It...

620
00:56:05,253 --> 00:56:08,643
See? I told you. Fairies are real!

621
00:56:12,893 --> 00:56:15,532
It's okay. She won't hurt you.

622
00:56:18,013 --> 00:56:21,050
It's... Well, it's extraordinary!

623
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:23,289
Aren't her wings beautiful?

624
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:27,326
Yes. Very similar to Apoidea.
Or, no, no, odonata.

625
00:56:27,813 --> 00:56:31,089
Look at the limb proportionality
to the cranial radius.

626
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:33,528
- Fascinating!
- Isn't she magical?

627
00:56:34,053 --> 00:56:36,886
She's some sort
of evolutionary mutation.

628
00:56:37,133 --> 00:56:39,249
She's not a bug, she's a person.

629
00:56:39,373 --> 00:56:40,567
- Exactly!
- Tinker Bell!

630
00:56:40,693 --> 00:56:42,490
This is going to be
the discovery of the century!

631
00:56:42,613 --> 00:56:43,728
Tink, watch out!

632
00:56:43,853 --> 00:56:45,809
- Vidia?
- Get out of the way!

633
00:56:48,773 --> 00:56:51,367
I must get this to the museum
right away!

634
00:56:51,493 --> 00:56:52,721
Father, no!

635
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,449
Please, Father! Wait!

636
00:56:58,333 --> 00:56:58,573
- You can't do this!
- Lizzy, I don't have much time.

637
00:56:58,573 --> 00:57:01,167
- You can't do this!
- Lizzy, I don't have much time.

638
00:57:01,653 --> 00:57:03,962
The trustees will only wait for me
until 9:00.

639
00:57:04,093 --> 00:57:05,890
Please, go back in the house.

640
00:57:06,013 --> 00:57:09,050
Don't worry.
Mrs Perkins will be here any second.

641
00:57:14,253 --> 00:57:16,608
Tinker Bell, I'm so sorry!

642
00:57:17,093 --> 00:57:19,766
My father's taking your friend
to the city!

643
00:57:21,693 --> 00:57:24,253
- Step, step, step.
- Step, step, step.

644
00:57:24,773 --> 00:57:26,206
- Tinker Bell?
- Tinker Bell!

645
00:57:26,533 --> 00:57:28,285
Look, it's your friends.

646
00:57:29,213 --> 00:57:32,888
- Hurry.
- That's it. Good kitty.

647
00:57:37,373 --> 00:57:40,410
Look, Lizzy's father trapped Vidia
in a jar while she was saving me.

648
00:57:40,533 --> 00:57:43,172
- We have to hurry and rescue her.
- Here we go again!

649
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,853
- How are we gonna get there?
- Yeah, it's still raining.

650
00:57:45,973 --> 00:57:50,205
Maybe we can't fly in the rain,
but I think I know someone who can.

651
00:58:00,933 --> 00:58:02,651
I'm scared, Tinker Bell.

652
00:58:02,773 --> 00:58:06,971
Floating around my room is one thing,
but flying all the way to London...

653
00:58:10,693 --> 00:58:11,648
That easy, huh?

654
00:58:13,453 --> 00:58:15,125
Okay. I'll be brave.

655
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:19,446
All right, fairies.
We need all the pixie dust we can get.

656
00:58:19,573 --> 00:58:22,326
This girl's got a long journey
ahead of her.

657
00:58:32,973 --> 00:58:34,247
All aboard!

658
00:58:37,173 --> 00:58:38,242
Ready?

659
00:58:39,733 --> 00:58:41,246
This better work.

660
00:58:44,773 --> 00:58:46,206
Sorry, fairies.

661
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:56,608
Careful now!

662
00:58:58,853 --> 00:59:01,526
Hi, Mrs Perkins. Bye, Mrs Perkins.

663
00:59:01,733 --> 00:59:04,406
Bye, dear. Fly back soon.

664
00:59:32,853 --> 00:59:34,081
Good idea.

665
01:00:15,213 --> 01:00:16,282
Sorry!

666
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:18,766
Out of the way!

667
01:00:22,533 --> 01:00:23,488
There he is!

668
01:00:28,253 --> 01:00:31,563
Tinker Bell, I can't keep up.
He's going too fast.

669
01:00:46,293 --> 01:00:49,251
Tink! Tinker Bell, no!

670
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:49,370
No, no, no, no, no, no! Come on!

671
01:01:52,933 --> 01:01:54,207
Come on, please, let them still be there.

672
01:02:01,533 --> 01:02:04,605
- Father!
- What in the world?

673
01:02:05,053 --> 01:02:08,523
Father, stop! Don't take her in there!

674
01:02:10,813 --> 01:02:14,123
It... It... It... It can't be.

675
01:02:18,573 --> 01:02:21,690
Lizzy? You're flying.

676
01:02:23,133 --> 01:02:24,407
Yes, I am.

677
01:02:26,693 --> 01:02:29,685
But how? How are you doing that?

678
01:02:32,733 --> 01:02:34,610
My friends showed me how.

679
01:02:40,453 --> 01:02:42,842
I... I don't understand.

680
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:45,563
You don't have to understand.

681
01:02:46,853 --> 01:02:49,083
You just have to believe.

682
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,286
I do believe.

683
01:02:56,613 --> 01:02:58,046
I do believe!

684
01:02:59,493 --> 01:03:00,608
Father!

685
01:03:03,093 --> 01:03:05,402
Lizzy, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

686
01:03:06,613 --> 01:03:09,764
I'll never doubt you again.

687
01:03:23,613 --> 01:03:24,682
Vidia!

688
01:03:30,213 --> 01:03:32,568
- Let's go home, Father.
- But how?

689
01:03:37,773 --> 01:03:39,445
Think happy thoughts.

690
01:03:44,773 --> 01:03:48,083
- Lift your arms and kick your feet!
- Careful!

691
01:03:51,613 --> 01:03:55,401
I think I'm getting the hang of it. Yes!
Why, I'm flying!

692
01:03:55,533 --> 01:04:01,768
- You're doing it, Father! You're doing it!
- I could get used to this! Just a second.

693
01:04:02,373 --> 01:04:05,251
There's something
I've always wanted to do. Follow me!

694
01:04:34,213 --> 01:04:35,965
- Hey, Tink.
- Hey, Vidia.

695
01:04:36,413 --> 01:04:38,802
So, you ever been
to one of these before?

696
01:04:38,933 --> 01:04:40,446
Yeah. It's pretty fun.

697
01:04:40,573 --> 01:04:44,122
- What are you supposed to do?
- It's easy. You just pick this up.

698
01:04:44,253 --> 01:04:46,642
- Like this?
- Yeah. And then you hold it out.

699
01:04:46,773 --> 01:04:49,731
- Got it!
- Now, just raise your pinkie, like this.

700
01:04:50,773 --> 01:04:54,652
And then you say, "Excuse me, miss,
but may I have a spot of tea?"

701
01:04:55,133 --> 01:04:58,443
Why, certainly, Miss Bell.
A nice, fresh cup.

702
01:04:59,893 --> 01:05:03,806
But of course you may have one, too.
This is a tea party, after all.

703
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:05,844
How about a cup for me, Miss Griffiths?

704
01:05:05,973 --> 01:05:07,725
Why, of course, Doctor.

705
01:05:07,893 --> 01:05:10,202
- It's my pleasure, I'm sure.
- Thank you.

706
01:05:10,333 --> 01:05:14,042
- And would you like one lump or two?
- Make mine three.

707
01:05:14,893 --> 01:05:16,042
Father!

708
01:05:20,693 --> 01:05:21,648
Thank you.

709
01:05:23,493 --> 01:05:27,202
- Isn't this pleasant, Father?
- I can't imagine anything better.

710
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:29,893
Although, chiming the Big Ben
comes a close second.

711
01:05:30,853 --> 01:05:32,889
- Oh, my goodness.
- Scrumptious.

712
01:05:43,053 --> 01:05:44,964
Don't even think about it.

713
01:05:55,053 --> 01:05:57,283
So, where were we? Yes.

714
01:05:58,013 --> 01:06:02,006
"Fairies have many magical talents.
They can talk to animals,

715
01:06:02,693 --> 01:06:06,572
"make the flowers bloom,
create warm summer breezes."

716
01:06:08,373 --> 01:06:10,170
Lizzy, what a beautiful drawing.

717
01:06:12,933 --> 01:06:15,925
"And some invent
the most clever little gadgets."

718
01:06:16,173 --> 01:06:19,165
Well, Tink,
you found something to fix after all.

719
01:06:19,733 --> 01:06:21,371
Yeah. I guess I did.

720
01:06:21,693 --> 01:06:25,572
"They bring the change of seasons,
and help nature in many ways.

721
01:06:26,853 --> 01:06:31,768
"But the best talent a fairy can have
is simply being a friend."

722
01:06:33,373 --> 01:06:36,285
The breezes blow the clouds away

723
01:06:36,453 --> 01:06:39,490
A million things I want to say

724
01:06:39,693 --> 01:06:43,732
I don't ever want this day
To be done

725
01:06:44,093 --> 01:06:45,685
Summer's just begun

726
01:06:45,813 --> 01:06:48,247
Never seen the sky so blue

727
01:06:48,813 --> 01:06:51,611
Everything is clear and new

728
01:06:51,733 --> 01:06:55,965
Happy just to be with you in the sun

729
01:06:56,373 --> 01:06:57,488
Summer's just begun

730
01:07:14,808 --> 01:07:17,447
Hold my hand and fly

731
01:07:18,448 --> 01:07:21,121
Never say goodbye

732
01:07:22,368 --> 01:07:25,121
Cross the open sky

733
01:07:26,008 --> 01:07:28,681
Leave the world behind

734
01:07:29,928 --> 01:07:32,886
I will be all right

735
01:07:33,488 --> 01:07:36,878
If you stay by my side

736
01:07:37,248 --> 01:07:40,923
Spring and summer
Love and laughter

737
01:07:41,048 --> 01:07:44,643
We'll live happy ever after

738
01:07:45,088 --> 01:07:49,366
We'll fly higher
Than we thought we'd be

739
01:07:49,488 --> 01:07:52,446
Because you showed me

740
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:55,002
How to believe

741
01:08:02,008 --> 01:08:04,647
Tiny shining star

742
01:08:05,808 --> 01:08:08,322
I know who you are

743
01:08:09,248 --> 01:08:12,365
You're never very far

744
01:08:12,968 --> 01:08:15,926
We'll never be apart

745
01:08:17,008 --> 01:08:19,966
Sparkle in my eye

746
01:08:20,808 --> 01:08:24,244
Light the sky tonight

747
01:08:24,448 --> 01:08:28,123
Spring and summer
Love and laughter

748
01:08:28,408 --> 01:08:32,037
We'll live happy ever after

749
01:08:32,168 --> 01:08:36,320
We'll fly higher
Than we thought we'd be

750
01:08:36,688 --> 01:08:39,361
Because you showed me

751
01:08:39,488 --> 01:08:43,481
How to believe

752
01:08:44,808 --> 01:08:48,278
In me

753
01:09:09,968 --> 01:09:13,358
Fall and winter
Love and laughter

754
01:09:13,688 --> 01:09:17,044
We'll live happy ever after

755
01:09:17,488 --> 01:09:21,879
We'll fly higher
Than we thought we'd be

756
01:09:22,008 --> 01:09:24,886
Because you showed me

757
01:09:25,008 --> 01:09:27,568
How to believe

758
01:09:28,408 --> 01:09:29,363
Yeah

759
01:09:42,048 --> 01:09:44,881
Hold my hand and fly

760
01:09:45,688 --> 01:09:49,203
Never say goodbye

761
01:09:52,688 --> 01:10:03,203
THE END
