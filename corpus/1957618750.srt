00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,291
<i>Sam Snow.</i>

2
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,171
<i>Kit Casey.</i>

3
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,995
The Creature Cases!

4
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:59,423
<i>The Riddle of the Raging Rhinos.</i>

5
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:11,955
Hey.

6
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,791
Rita! Rick! Thanks for coming out.

7
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,791
Hey, Reggie.

8
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:24,165
Love it when we all get together
like this, Reggie.

9
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,920
No fightin', no feudin',

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,920
everybody's relaxed, and--

11
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,251
-What's gotten into you?

12
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:49,076
What a long day.

13
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:53,706
By long, you must mean amazing.
We cracked the Case of the Cunning Cougar!

14
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:56,751
We solved
the Secret of the Slimy Salamander.

15
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:00,083
And I just beat
my all-time high score! Top that!

16
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,875
I'm ready to get a good night's sleep.

17
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,128
-Bedtime will have to wait.

18
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:10,328
The CLADE crest! The Director's got
a new Creature Case for us!

19
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:14,916
Director Scratch?

20
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:19,083
<i>Oh.</i> <i>Hi, agents.</i>
<i>Just brushing my teeth before bed.</i>

21
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,751
-Chickens don't have teeth--

22
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:28,003
<i>Agents, there's a major mystery</i>
<i>at the Watering Hole Club.</i>

23
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,583
<i>The Mice Squad took this footage earlier.</i>

24
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,956
Whoa. Those rhinos are going wild.

25
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,211
<i>We call it "Rhino Rage."</i>

26
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,501
<i>Your mission</i>
<i>is to figure out what's causing it</i>

27
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,133
<i>before anyone gets hurt.</i>

28
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,708
Looks serious.

29
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:42,881
We'll investigate!

30
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:45,748
<i>Good luck, agents.</i>
<i>CLADE is counting on you.</i>

31
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,083
-Well, better turn around.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,960
R.O.N., set course for the Watering Hole.

33
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,125
<i>Now arriving at destination biome,</i>

34
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,501
<i>-African Grasslands.</i>
-Thanks, R.O.N.

35
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:15,583
Hm. Local wildlife includes zebras,
warthogs, leopards…

36
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,706
Don't see any raging rhinos though.

37
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,421
They must all be inside the club.
We'd better go--

38
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,170
Oh! Uh…

39
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,920
Oops.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,210
A genet!

41
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,751
I'm real sorry.
I was just chasing after that bug.

42
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,043
Genets eat just about anything,
but they love to eat bugs.

43
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,165
Good bugs out tonight?

44
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,880
-They're okay.

45
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,458
I guess.

46
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,751
All the best bugs
are inside the Watering Hole,

47
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,963
but they're only letting
rhinos in tonight.

48
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,171
Oh!

49
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,290
See ya!

50
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,575
Only rhinos?

51
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,245
We'll see about that.

52
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,125
Evening, sir. We're here to--

53
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,208
Sorry, pal.

54
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,081
Private party tonight.

55
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,746
We already had enough trouble.

56
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,253
-But--
-Rhinos only.

57
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,753
Step aside, Sam.

58
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,246
Huh?

59
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:11,213
You two ain't rhinos,
but you seem all right.

60
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,880
Have a nice time.

61
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,208
Kit, how did you--

62
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:22,461
Rubbing noses is how rhinos say hello.
Kinda like a secret rhino handshake.

63
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,541
Come on!
Let's see what the trouble's about!

64
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,923
Hm…

65
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,001
Hiya.

66
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,831
Only one entrance, heavily guarded.

67
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,630
Clu-Bots, take a look around.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,830
Ew! So many bugs.

69
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,875
Forget the bugs. Look at all the rhinos.

70
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,288
Don't often see them
all together like this.

71
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,455
They usually hang out alone.

72
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:56,171
That's why these rhino nights
are so special.

73
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,380
Name's Reggie.

74
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,998
I organized all this.

75
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,083
And trust me,

76
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,076
we were all having a real nice time,

77
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:06,576
but then folks just started freaking out.

78
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,576
Rest assured, CLADE is on the case.

79
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,076
Agent Sam Snow.

80
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,416
And Kit Casey.

81
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,670
Animal Detectives.

82
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,920
Oh! Get it off!

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,750
-Get it off!
-Oh!

84
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,383
-Get it off!

85
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,083
Help!

86
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,131
Rhino Rage!

87
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,333
Keep out of her way!

88
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:34,958
Whoa…

89
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,253
Sam! Over here!

90
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,713
Whoa…

91
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,580
Oh!

92
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:46,536
Phew!

93
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,581
Clu-Bots, show me
what's going on out there.

94
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,328
It's a 9.7 on the Rhino-Rage meter!

95
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,786
9.7? I've never seen it that high.

96
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,915
Something made her really mad.

97
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,293
The Rhino-Rage meter is dropping.

98
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,665
It's safe again.

99
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,580
Huh?

100
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,666
Oh, phew!

101
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,041
Is it gone?

102
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:12,995
Is what gone?

103
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:17,923
I don't know what it was,
but it jumped onto my back outta nowhere.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,920
I was attacked, I tell ya.

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,080
Attacked? Maybe that's why
the Rhinos are acting so strange.

106
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:27,376
But who would attack a full-grown rhino?

107
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,748
Beats me.
And it's only us rhinos here tonight.

108
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,331
Except for you two.

109
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,326
Hm…

110
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,786
Uh, not exactly.

111
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,825
There's also a bunch of bugs in here, and…

112
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,581
An oxpecker bird!

113
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,626
Him?

114
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:47,078
Aw, that's just Paulie. He keeps me clean.

115
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:51,416
Yeah. Don't bring me into this.
I didn't start any trouble.

116
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,630
Easy, Paulie.

117
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,708
We just wanna know if you saw anything.

118
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,961
I didn't see nothin'.
It all happened too fast.

119
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,831
And I was distracted by all these bugs.

120
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:01,876
Come on, Paulie.

121
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,498
I'm thirsty.

122
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:05,496
Wait!

123
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:07,705
Check it out.

124
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,751
-Four muddy paw prints!
-Huh?

125
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,333
Whoever jumped
on Rita's back left them behind.

126
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,246
Ha!

127
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,713
Told you it wasn't me.

128
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,381
See? One, two.

129
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,288
Two feet,

130
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,285
no mud.

131
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:19,205
He's right.

132
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,711
Whoever's causing
all the Rhino Rage has four muddy feet.

133
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,881
-Hm…

134
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:27,961
Here we go again!

135
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,881
Reggie! Not you too!

136
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,580
Oops.

137
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:48,958
Whoa!

138
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,166
Whoa!

139
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,208
Whew…

140
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,381
Sorry. My bad.

141
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,708
Everybody okay?

142
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,630
Could be better!

143
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,205
Hm.

144
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,420
Ah-ha!

145
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,210
Kit, how does it feel to be
in the presence of a master detective?

146
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,791
Why? You see one around?

147
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,625
I mean me.

148
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,458
I've noticed another clue.

149
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,251
Look at where we're standing.

150
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:24,996
Under a tree?

151
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:28,833
Exactly! All the Rhino Rages
started under trees!

152
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,416
Show her, Clu-Bots.

153
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,416
Well, ain't that something.

154
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,540
So there's a four-pawed critter
on the loose,

155
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,285
jumping out of trees
and scaring the rhinos.

156
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,165
I think I saw it runnin' away.

157
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,500
You did? What'd it look like, Reggie?

158
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:49,003
Well, it was small, almost like a cat,
with a pointy face and dark spots.

159
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,383
Uh, like this?

160
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:54,248
Yeah! That's it, but without the go-kart.

161
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,543
Eh, I just like drawing go-karts.

162
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,665
Hm…

163
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,750
A spotted cat creature.
Sounds like a leopard to me.

164
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:02,793
A leopard?

165
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,455
You better be pulling my horn.

166
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:05,381
Leopard?!

167
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,418
There's a leopard on the loose?

168
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,881
Not so fast, Sam.

169
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,078
This was no leopard. Look.

170
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,956
The spots don't match, see?

171
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,785
We can't risk it.

172
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,665
If there's even a chance
a leopard is attacking folks,

173
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,380
I gotta shut down the Watering Hole.

174
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,828
Aw…

175
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:28,878
Hold up, Reggie.
You might be able to keep the party going.

176
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,668
-If we can just figure out…

177
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:33,831
The bugs!

178
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,286
Whiskers, that's it!

179
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,205
What's it?

180
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,671
Kit, I know who's jumping on the rhinos!

181
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,750
And I know how to catch her too.

182
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:47,998
Sam, this decoy look pretty real.
There's even bugs buzzing around it.

183
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,883
Just like a real rhino.

184
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,038
But what's the plan here?

185
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,745
Isn't it obvious? We're setting a trap!

186
00:09:55,666 --> 00:10:00,286
Someone with four muddy paws is jumping
out of trees and onto the rhinos

187
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,915
to eat the bugs.

188
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,880
Of course! It must have been--

189
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,503
-The genet we met earlier!
-Uh-oh.

190
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,083
There she goes!

191
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,626
Quick! She's getting away!

192
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,785
Oh no, she's not!

193
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,665
Goin' somewhere?

194
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,706
Hi.

195
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:46,326
This is who's been sneaking
in here and scaring everybody?

196
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,326
Sure is.

197
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,706
This little genet has four muddy paws,

198
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,751
jumps out of trees,
and she loves to eat bugs.

199
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,083
Oops.

200
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:58,036
I didn't mean to cause trouble.
There's just so many tasty bugs in here.

201
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,625
And I can reach 'em better
when I jump on your backs.

202
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:05,038
Sorry. Rhinos only tonight.
You gotta scram.

203
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:05,955
Oh…

204
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,171
I do?

205
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,830
-Maybe not.
-Hm?

206
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,416
I've got an idea.

207
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,285
Glad things
are back to normal.

208
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,035
And hey, those bugs are gone too.

209
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:25,285
Yeah. All thanks
to our new official bug-eater.

210
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,956
Do you mind if I hop up?

211
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,751
-Sure thing, doll.

212
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,421
She's gonna go far
in this business.

213
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,578
Great idea, guys.

214
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,036
Don't mention it, Reg.

215
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,205
Just glad to have
another Creature Case closed.

216
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,245
Sam?

217
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,133
Look who's sleepy now.

218
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,503
Hey! That's my job!

225
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,538

226
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,915
<i>It's like a friendly rhino hello.</i>

227
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:35,628
<i>Animals called genets are known</i>

228
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,788

230

This is the part! Turn it up!

241
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,668
You were right!
This new Mice Squad song is amazing!

242
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,580
Yeah! I can't get enough of it.

243
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,746
Hey, where are those guys?

244
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,133
Yeah, good question.

245
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,538
We haven't heard
from Bill and Jill in a while.

246
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,375
-Uh, is this part of the video?

247
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:51,128
Don't think so.
Director Scratch wants to see us.

248
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,325
Hey, Director. Got a new case for us?

249
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,746
I'm afraid not, agents,
and that's the problem.

250
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,923
-Huh?
-I'm not sure I understand,

251
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,830
Director Scratch.

252
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:06,376
Agents, we've got a mystery
that involves two of our own.

253
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,291
-The Mice Squad are missing.

254
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,035
Bill and Jill!

255
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:14,995
They were working in the Arctic
when we received this distress call.

256
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:19,133
<i>Come get us. I repeat, come get us.</i>

257
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,708
Whoa. That didn't sound too good.

258
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,251
No, it doesn't.

259
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:27,333
That's why I need you to head
to the Arctic and find them fast.

260
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,666
You can count on us, Director.

261
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,538
<i>Now arriving</i>
<i>at destination biome…</i>

262
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,745
<i>…Arctic Tundra.</i>

263
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,460
All right, this is it.
The Mice Squad's last known location.

264
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:13,293
Kit, would you stop humming
and help me look for them?

265
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,205
I'm only humming to keep warm.

266
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,751
Not all of us
like the cold as much as you.

267
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,543
Including the Mice Squad.
Which is why we better find them fast.

268
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,535
Can't argue with that. Come on!

269
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
No sign of them. Or their van.

270
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,753
No sign of much of anything.

271
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,081
What was that?

272
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,541
Over there! A herd of musk oxen!

273
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,245
Maybe they've seen
Bill and Jill. Let's go!

274
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,380
Go, go, go!

275
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,128
-Woo!
-Aa!

276
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,876
What are they doing?
-Don't worry about it, Sam.

277
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,998
Butting heads is what musk oxen do.

278
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,333
Hello, there!
I don't suppose you've seen--

279
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,626
-A wolf!

280
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,248
Protect the children!

281
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:11,748
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, folks.
I'm not a wolf. I'm a snow leopard.

282
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:12,833
And I'm a fox.

283
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,456
Well, that isn't much better.

284
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,381
Who are you, and what do you want?

285
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,748
We were just wondering
if you had seen our friends?

286
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,133
No, we haven't.
Unless your friends are wolves…

287
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,038
Wolves?

288
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,745
…then we haven't seen anyone here.

289
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:24,833
Are you sure?

290
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:28,536
Maybe you've heard them
playing their music or seen their van?

291
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,166
She said we haven't seen 'em.

292
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,250
We musk oxen keep to our herd,
and we don't mess with outsiders.

293
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,713
We don't have time for anybody else.

294
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,631
If we get
even the slightest bit distracted,

295
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,288
it could put our calves in danger.

296
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,665
But maybe--

297
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,880
You'd better move along,
before we move you along.

298
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,376
Talk about a cold shoulder.

299
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:57,458
Well, if we can't get any information
out of the musk oxen,

300
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,921
maybe we should track down
the wolves they mentioned.

301
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,420
Good idea, Kit.

302
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,040
Scanning for wolf prints.

303
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,583
Ah-ha! There.

304
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,961
The wolves are heading that way.

305
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:12,878
I see 'em.

306
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,416
Whoa! They're moving pretty fast.

307
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,710
We've gotta catch up with them. But how?

308
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,131
The Stinkwells!

309
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,708
<i>-Hello, Kit.</i>
<i>-Hello, Sam.</i>

310
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:25,881
Hey, Stinkwells.

311
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,958
<i>We are so worried about Bill </i>und<i> Jill.</i>

312
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,171
<i>Have you found them yet?</i>

313
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,170
Not yet. But we're tracking some wolves
who might have some clues.

314
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,540
And we need to go fast!

315
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:38,165
<i>We had a feeling this might happen.</i>

316
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,750
<i>That's why we packed</i>
<i>some special vehicles for you in R.O.N.</i>

317
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,503
<i>We'll send them to you now.</i>

318
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,708
<i>Sorry. He does that when he's worried.</i>

319
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,291
<i>Ah, there they are.</i>

320
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,625
Snow Cycles!

321
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,955
They're beautiful! Thanks, Stinkwells!

322
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,381
<i>You're welcome. Good luck.</i>

323
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,293
Oh…

324
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,205
Woo-hoo!

325
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,751
Come on! Let's catch up with those wolves!

326
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,540
Sam, look out for that ice.

327
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,631
-Oh?

328
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,581
Whoa! Oh!

329
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,325
Whoa! Come on! Come on!

330
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,285
-Whoa!
-Woo-hoo!

331
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,625
Whoa!

332
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,080
-Phew! Huh?

333
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,286
Look! We've almost caught up with them!

334
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,245
Hey, wolves! We need to talk to you!

335
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,543
They can't hear us.

336
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,245
We gotta get closer.

337
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,540
Hey. Where did they go?

338
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:17,455
Uh-oh.

339
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,710
Why are you following us?

340
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,631
Easy, now.
We're just looking for our friends.

341
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,958
Uh, I don't suppose
you've seen the Mice Squad?

342
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,711
-The Mice Squad?!

343
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,131
The Mice Squad are here?

344
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,628
Oh. You've heard of them.

345
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,378
Heard of 'em?
We're, like, their biggest fans!

346
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,668
Yeah!

347
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,630
I still can't get over
how amazing their new song is!

348
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,536
We haven't seen 'em,
but let us know if you find 'em.

349
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,245
I'd love to get their autograph.

350
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:04,995
Later, dudes.

351
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,460
-Huh. Well, that was unexpected.

352
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,751
So the wolves haven't seen them either.

353
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,963
I'm afraid this case has gone cold.

354
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,921
I'll say.

355
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,500
The temperature's dropping.

356
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:20,043
We gotta find Bill and Jill
before they freeze out there.

357
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,501
-All we have is their distress call.

358
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:27,213
<i>Come get us. I repeat, come get us.</i>

359
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,001
Maybe there's some clue we missed.

360
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:32,713
Don't think we missed anything. All I hear
is that great beat in the background.

361
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:36,331
Well, it's good, yes,
but I wouldn't call it great just yet.

362
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,916
Listen. It's offbeat.

363
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,206
-Did ya hear it?

364
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,671
-You're right.

365
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,500
Those drums <i>are</i> all messed up.

366
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,630
They might not be drums at all! Listen!

367
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,961
It almost sounds like…

368
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:55,496
The musk oxen headbutting!
Bill and Jill must've been near them!

369
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,423
So the musk oxen <i>are</i> mixed up in this!

370
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,330
But how?

371
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:02,626
We'd better go back and ask 'em,
whether they like it or not. Come on!

372
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,250
-Look! There they are!
-Hey!

373
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,293
Musk oxen! Wait up!

374
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,995
-Whoa!

375
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:15,083
I thought we already warned you
not to come back here!

376
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,208
Oops.

377
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:21,918
Uh-oh.

378
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,630
We're standing on a frozen lake!

379
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,131
Get back to the shore!

380
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,750
Oh no! My babies!

381
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,165
This is bad, Sam.

382
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,170
Musk oxen are not good swimmers.

383
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,670
-Come on!
-We've gotta get them back to shore!

384
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,420
Those ice floes…

385
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,500
Maybe…

386
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,043
-If we…

387
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,285
On it, Kit.

388
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:46,705
Clu-Bot, go!

389
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,250
Wait for it.

390
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,503
Wait for it…

391
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:02,923
Now!

392
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,043
This way, everybody.

393
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,083
Just one more.

394
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:12,915
Whoa! Woo!

395
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,500
Uh! There you go.

396
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,133
Our babies! You saved them!

397
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,578
Just doing our jobs, ma'am.

398
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:21,666
You might wanna consider
getting this little guy a haircut, though.

399
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,790
-He can barely see where he's going.
-Mm?

400
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,075
Not mine.

401
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,076
Uh, did I say something wrong?

402
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:30,166
This strange-looking fellow
doesn't belong to any of us.

403
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,170
He doesn't?

404
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:35,328
Actually, I don't think
this is a calf at all.

405
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:37,996
Is it a wolf in oxen's clothing?

406
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,963
This is no wolf!

407
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,828
-It's the Mice Squad!

408
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,666
They've been here all along!

409
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,251
Oh, hey, guys.

410
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:50,173
Bill! Jill! We got your distress call.

411
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:54,673
<i>Come get us. I repeat, come get us.</i>

412
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,580
Are you okay?

413
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,956
Distress call? You mean this?

414
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:00,461
<i>We're doing undercover work</i>
<i>in the tundra.</i>

415
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:04,581
<i>No need to come get us.</i>
<i>I repeat, no need to come get us.</i>

416
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:07,456
The cold weather
must have scrambled it. Weird.

417
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:09,581
But why were you undercover?

418
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,540
That's why.

419
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:14,745
We wanted to record
that sound for our new track.

420
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:17,173
We didn't even see you guys
under all this fur.

421
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,830
We're just glad you're okay.

422
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:21,166
Everyone at CLADE will be so relieved.

423
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,580
Another Creature Case…

424
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:23,496
Closed!

425
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:27,003
So, you were recording our headbutting
to use in your song?

426
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:29,076
Can we hear it?

427
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,920
All this dancing is warming me up.

428
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,750
Oh yeah? Just wait
till you see my cool moves!

429
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,213
Uh… Whoa…

430
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:53,043
You're looking pretty cool, all right.

431
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,461
<i>Mice Squad Fact File.</i>

432
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:08,291
<i>Status?</i>

433
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:09,535
<i>System Settings?</i>

434
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,630
<i>Update. Musk oxen.</i>

435
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:19,251
<i>Musk oxen are pretty shy</i>
<i>and mostly stick with their herd.</i>

436
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:22,833
<i>When threatened,</i>
<i>they form a ring to protect their young.</i>

437
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:27,333
<i>They live where it's cold.</i>

438
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:30,246
<i>But watch out for thin ice.</i>
<i>They can't swim well.</i>

439
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:35,208
<i>Male musk oxen sometimes</i>
<i>ram their heads together. Bam!</i>

440
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:38,041
<i>It's so loud,</i>
<i>you can hear it from far away.</i>

441
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,626
<i>Error. Upload incomplete.</i>

442
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:43,248
How to fix it?

443
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,003
<i>Move your feet.</i>
