1
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:56,156
- No, your name.
- Please tell me your name.

2
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,826
My name is Charles Ruchowski.

3
00:00:58,926 --> 00:00:59,991
No!

4
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:07,568
Say the name, Mr.... Mr. Lake!

5
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:10,971
Tell me, Mr. Lake.
Tell me, what is his name?

6
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,942
What is the name of the spy?
What is the name of the double?

7
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:17,711
My name is Charles Ruchowski...

8
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:22,115
- Okay.
- ...a representative for spirit systems.

9
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:25,150
- One more time.
- A representative...

10
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,056
Well, you tell me...

11
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:32,159
just tell me, Mr. Lake...

12
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,028
- Charles Ruchowski.
- ...what I

13
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:37,596
need to know!

14
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,072
This... this doesn't end.

15
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:47,808
No, no, no. It ends...

16
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:50,375
when you die!

17
00:01:57,249 --> 00:02:00,187
Every year at this time,
it is my pleasure...

18
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,290
an honor, really... to introduce

19
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,260
former deputy station chief, Beirut,

20
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,098
chief of station Kabul,
holder of the Donovan award,

21
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,534
the distinguished intelligence medal

22
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:18,272
and the only living recipient
of the intelligence star,

23
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,705
Evan Lake. Evan.

24
00:02:31,717 --> 00:02:36,156
What the hell are you doing here?
Haven't you heard?

25
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:40,661
The C.I.A. fell from the Berlin
wall and all the president's men

26
00:02:40,762 --> 00:02:44,164
can't put it back together again!
It's broke!

27
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:49,202
Not reliable. Not trustworthy.
Can't stand up to the white house.

28
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:53,340
Backstabbers. Watching porn,
tapping phones.

29
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,674
Best and brightest quit or retired.

30
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:03,648
What in the name of Jesus Christ nailed
to the cross are you doing here?

31
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,290
Because you heard the call.
That's why.

32
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,760
Your future spread out before
you like a cruise-ship buffet.

33
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:21,234
You were teaching in a
classroom, working in a kitchen,

34
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,102
training in a gym and
you heard the call.

35
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:29,876
For some it was adventure.
For some, mystique.

36
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:33,914
For all, it was 9/11
and you heard the call,

37
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:39,520
and it was the call of duty
and love of country. Why?

38
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,954
Because you have values!

39
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:56,269
- Thanks again, Ev. We appreciate it.
- Think they believed a word of it?

40
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:59,106
- I did.
- You were always an easy touch.

41
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:02,009
I won't be here next year.
On my way out.

42
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,878
What? You're a pup. What are you, 40?

43
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,981
- Got an offer from the private sector.
- You'll miss it.

44
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,282
Maybe I'll come back next year
just to hear your speech.

45
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,247
Die!

46
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:42,282
It ends...

47
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:45,517
when you die!

48
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:50,991
If you were a reasonable man,
you and I could talk about America.

49
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:55,028
You would drink something, you would...
you would... you would be set free.

50
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,365
But no, no, no. You want to...

51
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:03,737
You want to die... He wants
to die, like, what? Crusader!

52
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:09,310
No. No, Mr. Lake. No,
it's better that you don't die.

53
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,713
- Charles Ruchowski.
- No, you don't die. No, no, no, no, no.

54
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,879
Today, you suffer.

55
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,350
I was talking to someone
down at the farm.

56
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,417
They said you gave a real
barn burner this morning.

57
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,922
What's on your mind?

58
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,760
When I started riding a desk,
it was supposed to be temporary.

59
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,562
- That was six years ago.
- You've made your country very proud.

60
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:09,369
I've gone through all the proper channels,
I've submitted the paperwork,

61
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:13,540
but I can't seem to reach anyone.
And I am sorry to bother you with this.

62
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,243
How long have you been
in government service?

63
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:19,045
Marines six years. Agency 30.

64
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:23,483
S.I.S. three. 36 years,
last three years at medium pay.

65
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,354
That's... That's 110,000 a year.

66
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:29,520
Hell, I'd retire for that much.

67
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:37,194
I doubt that, sir.

68
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:44,536
I have skills better
deployed in the field.

69
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:49,576
Ev, you have been
an inspiration to me.

70
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,545
I'm not afraid to admit it.

71
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:55,414
I'll look into it, see what I can do.

72
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:09,961
Come in.

73
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:13,767
- Milt.
- Wanna grab lunch?

74
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,800
Not today.

75
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:19,005
- How'd it go?
- Not so good.

76
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,106
Director said he's going
to see what he can do.

77
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:28,615
- You all right?
- Gotta tamper down, get it under control.

78
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:30,951
Hey, put that dictionary on my hand.

79
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:34,454
It's that book over there,
the orange one. It's a dictionary.

80
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,955
I know what a dictionary is.
Thank you.

81
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:42,263
There are two kinds of
people in this world,

82
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:45,430
men of action and everyone else.

83
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,302
I'll see you.

84
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,555
Stay!

85
00:11:40,197 --> 00:11:42,083
- Yes?
- Milton?

86
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:45,505
- Yes.
- This is Bob Deacon at NSA.

87
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:49,175
A while back you put in a watch
for certain chemical compounds.

88
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:53,580
- This was three years ago.
- You still interested in that?

89
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,482
- I am.
- Good, something's come up.

90
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:58,118
Where can I find you? I'm coming over.

91
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:02,388
A couple of weeks ago that flash drive
came into the possession of the Romanians.

92
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,757
It was water-damaged...
the guy jumped off a bridge.

93
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:08,161
S.R.I. had no luck, so they
asked us to take a crack at it.

94
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:14,534
On it we found porn, Islamic sermons,
angry birds and medical reports.

95
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:18,905
That's where you come in. We ran
"decitabine" and your request came up.

96
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,708
Who was Abdi Abdikarim?

97
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:25,745
Kenyan national. We had some old passport
records. Other than that, nothing.

98
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,214
S.R.I. made inquiries...

99
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,450
but the Kenyans weren't
all that much help.

100
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,285
Can I have a copy of
the full document?

101
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,320
- There's over 50 pages.
- That's all right.

102
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,920
I'll take it electronically.

103
00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:48,168
You know that the only thing standing between
me and reassignment is your approval.

104
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,470
Mr. Lake, what do you wish
to do when you return?

105
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,040
- There is unfinished business.
- That's what I wish you would talk about.

106
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,311
Muhammad Banir is alive. They say
he's dead... everybody says...

107
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,047
- killed in the explosion.
- There was a body.

108
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:06,350
So what? I didn't see any head.
I didn't see Banir's head.

109
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:09,956
If you wish to return
to work at the C.I.A...

110
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,925
- If I wish to return?
- ...I would strongly suggest

111
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,659
that you put the matter of
Muhammad Banir behind you.

112
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,401
Fuck!

113
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,606
All the indications
pointed that direction,

114
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:30,110
but it wasn't until the pet scan was
complete that we could be sure.

115
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,444
No more memory tests?

116
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:34,543
Just the opposite. Mental exercises
are shown to be effective...

117
00:13:34,644 --> 00:13:37,581
All right, what is it?
Eight years and I'm dead?

118
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,721
Mr. Ruchowski,
this is not Alzheimer's.

119
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:46,492
For many years, frontotemporal dementia
and Alzheimer's were confused,

120
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:49,629
but frontotemporal dementia
is a separate disease.

121
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,996
It's better?

122
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:56,603
F.T.D. is much more aggressive.

123
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:59,839
Much more? How much more?

124
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,708
- Did anyone come with you today?
- No.

125
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:05,578
Family is very important
in a situation like this.

126
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:10,681
I don't have any brothers or sisters.
No children. My work is my family.

127
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:16,723
This frontal... F.T.D., is there
anything I should be on the lookout for?

128
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:20,860
You will be subject to overreactions
or inappropriate reactions,

129
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,529
blank spells. Perhaps you've
noticed this already.

130
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,966
Mood swings,
unreliable sensory perception.

131
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:32,272
"Unreliable sensory perception."
That's what it's called.

132
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:36,343
There are support groups,
social services here in Philadelphia...

133
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:38,642
in fact, wherever you go.

134
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,982
I've spoken with Dr. Gross,
Nathan Gross, in the special care wing.

135
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:47,020
Now after we're finished, you'll pay
him a visit. He's expecting you.

136
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,287
There's no reason to be alone in this.

137
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,938
- So what is prescribed?
- Usually serotonin inhibitors...

138
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,942
Zoloft, Paxil... or antidepressants.

139
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:14,080
But those are drugs for crazy people,
manic-depressives. That's not me.

140
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,649
Okay, let's get that clear.
That's not who I am.

141
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,153
Look, these medications address
the behavioral symptoms.

142
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:23,054
- Not the disease?
- That's correct.

143
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,629
Hey. Have you seen Lake?

144
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:07,633
- He hasn't been here all day.
- Do you know where he is? Did he call in?

145
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,867
I'm busy, sir. Sorry.

146
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:33,785
Yeah?

147
00:16:33,886 --> 00:16:37,595
Evan, where are you? I've been
trying to reach you. I left messages.

148
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,766
I've been busy.

149
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:42,135
- Something's come up.
- What?

150
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:44,070
I don't wanna talk about
it over an open line.

151
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,304
Where are you? I'll come meet you.

152
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:51,243
- Evan, where are you?
- Diamond Tuesdays.

153
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,313
You're at Ruby Tuesdays?

154
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:56,382
Yes, I'm at Ruby Tuesdays.
That's what I just said.

155
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,118
Okay, which one?

156
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,984
The one in...

157
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,621
Arlington.

158
00:17:19,804 --> 00:17:21,539
- Ev.
- Yeah?

159
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,042
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

160
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:27,480
Get this man something to eat, please,

161
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,414
- and a cup of coffee.
- You got it.

162
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,690
Can I clear that for you?

163
00:17:40,191 --> 00:17:42,593
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

164
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,934
That wasn't very sociable.

165
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,172
What's going on?

166
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:56,976
- Nothing.
- Do you want to talk about it?

167
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:02,246
What is so goddamn important?
This "something" that has come up.

168
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,950
There's been a possible hit on Banir.

169
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,923
Over the last year,
five requests for deferiprone

170
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,726
- which is not too unusual...
- No, it doesn't affect the anemia.

171
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:17,263
- It's just the iron deficiency.
- Right, but the same source...

172
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:19,332
the man requesting it was Kenyan,

173
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:24,804
but the doctor is in Bucharest University
Hospital, a research hospital.

174
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:29,609
Decitabine and Azacitidine, which are
only used for clinical trials...

175
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,745
- Mediterranean anemia.
- Thalassemia,

176
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:35,515
which is hereditary, which we
know Muhammad Banir carries,

177
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,150
even though he has
been dead for 20 years.

178
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,819
You know his father died of it.

179
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,458
And Abdikarim, the man procuring the drug,
was a suspect in a Nigerian fraud ring.

180
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:49,195
Rather than give himself up,
he jumps off a bridge.

181
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:53,499
Medical info was on a flash drive.

182
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,402
- He ain't no Kenyan.
- He was 100% healthy.

183
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:59,305
- He had no need for the medication.
- What else?

184
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:02,642
- Nothing.
- I knew he didn't die.

185
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:06,012
This means his condition has
moved to an advanced stage.

186
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:08,548
Now he can lay low,
he can become invisible,

187
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,315
but sooner or later the
disease will flush him out.

188
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,518
Banir's got it.

189
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,990
It's come out. It's in his blood.

190
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:18,048
Mbui!

191
00:20:32,363 --> 00:20:35,611
- Sorry to impose on our relationship.
- What is it?

192
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:39,770
I've come across intelligence which leads
me to believe Muhammad Banir is alive.

193
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,807
Give us the room, gentlemen.

194
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,220
Go on.

195
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,558
Banir was believed killed during my
extraction. The evidence was circumstantial.

196
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:01,894
Intelligence intercepts led the
agency to conclude Banir was dead.

197
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,631
He disappeared from our radar.
The C.I.A. closed the books on him.

198
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:07,900
Not a word about him has been
heard for 22 years... until now.

199
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,569
Banir has a hereditary
blood disease... thalassemia.

200
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,274
If not apparent during childhood,
it can lay dormant until midlife or later.

201
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,643
There have been recent
intercepts of requests

202
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:22,114
for medicine used primarily during
clinical trials for this anemia.

203
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,182
These requests have a Kenyan source.

204
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:31,791
- And what's the source of these intercepts?
- The source is confidential.

205
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,161
Lake, I am the director
of the fucking agency.

206
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:38,829
Nothing is confidential.
Who's the source?

207
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,101
If the source were to become known,

208
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:45,204
- the source would be in danger.
- What do you propose?

209
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,185
I would like to set up a task force,
establish Banir's whereabouts,

210
00:21:48,286 --> 00:21:51,343
extract him, and have him return
to the United States for trial.

211
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,479
You'd like to set up a task force?

212
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:57,249
- I meant the agency, sir.
- Why don't we just let the man die?

213
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,352
That is assuming that your
confidential source is correct,

214
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,188
and assuming that it
does in fact indicate

215
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:05,091
the presence of a man that no
one's heard of in 22 years.

216
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:08,661
Because it is not the policy of this agency,
nor is it the policy of this government,

217
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:13,065
to allow the man who's responsible
for at least 17 kidnappings,

218
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:16,168
a dozen executions and the
bombing of a tourist bus...

219
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:21,271
some of whom were children, by the way...
to go free simply because he's sick.

220
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,914
Mary, sent in Sanjar.

221
00:22:34,585 --> 00:22:35,719
Come in.

222
00:22:37,555 --> 00:22:41,227
This is Dr. Sanjar. He's with
the office of medical services.

223
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:43,462
Please, Evan, sit.

224
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:47,233
Dr. Sanjar was speaking
at Upenn Hospital...

225
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:50,102
a conference on
service-related diseases.

226
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,873
Did you really think you
could travel 150 miles,

227
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:57,977
make three visits to a neurological
clinic under a false identity,

228
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:02,012
give blood, leave fingerprints and
not have us find out about it?

229
00:23:02,947 --> 00:23:05,885
Dr. Clayborne forwarded
your medical records.

230
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:10,422
You don't have to worry about payment
or privacy or quality of care.

231
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,358
The C.I.A. Takes care of its own.

232
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,660
The O.M.S. has a
state-of-the-art facility.

233
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,464
In addition to which, we coordinate our
efforts with A.F.R.H. Here in Washington.

234
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,567
And we'd like to make this
as easy as possible for you.

235
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:25,271
We've been speaking to the D.D.O.
We'll have a retirement dinner.

236
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:28,474
The press... everyone'll come, heck,
even the president will be there.

237
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:32,278
Banir. What about Banir?

238
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:36,816
Muhammad Banir is dead, Lake.
Has been for 22 years.

239
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,451
We interviewed your
departmental associates.

240
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,354
We are concerned about these
mood swings you've been suffering,

241
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,256
the unpredictability of behavior.

242
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,590
Banir, damn it.

243
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:51,564
There is a concern that you could
become a liability to the agency.

244
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:53,966
- Fuck you.
- Calm down.

245
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:59,004
I'm a liability? You fucked this up just
like you fucked up everything else.

246
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:03,609
Fucked up Iran-contra, fucked up Ames,
fucked up 9/11, fucked up W.M.D.,

247
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:07,613
Afghanistan, Iraq, Benghazi.
Not you yourself of course, no.

248
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:10,082
No, you're just the latest
in a long line of fuck-ups

249
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:13,686
who turned this agency into a cesspool
of politics and special interests

250
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,422
on behalf of the weapons makers
and the surveillance industry,

251
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:17,990
who get richer while we get weaker!

252
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,324
- Mr. Lake.
- I could...

253
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:26,265
I've forgotten more about this
agency than you'll ever know.

254
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:31,370
Who put you up to this? Whose got
their hand in your pocket now?

255
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,341
I've seen a million people like you.
A million people.

256
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:37,343
You've got your head
so far up Obama's ass,

257
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:41,811
you can't see anything except
his shit anymore. Shame on you.

258
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,581
Shame on you.

259
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,292
- Agent Lake?
- Yes.

260
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:56,062
The director's asked us to
collect your security badge.

261
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,927
Please stand, sir.

262
00:25:01,898 --> 00:25:05,004
Sir, we've been instructed to
escort you out of the facility.

263
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:08,905
Place the items you would like to take
here on the desk for inspection, sir.

264
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:13,545
- You want to check my aftershave?
- There's no need to be snippy, sir.

265
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,687
You want my life? You want my files?
Here, take them!

266
00:25:16,788 --> 00:25:19,551
Would you like awards? Here.
Here's a couple of them for you.

267
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:23,556
This is what they give to assholes like me
who give their lives for their country!

268
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,723
Core values!

269
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:32,195
Get someone else to give your
goddamn lecture! I resign!

270
00:26:06,764 --> 00:26:11,768
I have your stuff. I... I hope you
don't mind. I didn't want to leave it there.

271
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,271
Can I come in?

272
00:26:15,673 --> 00:26:17,374
Yeah, come in.

273
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,143
Thanks.

274
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,657
You... you want something to drink?

275
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,759
What are you having?

276
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:36,426
- Sake.
- Sounds good.

277
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:51,310
I screwed up pretty bad today?

278
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,579
No going back.

279
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,348
So much for the retirement party.

280
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,551
They're not gonna do
nothing about Banir.

281
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,552
They treated me like I
was some sort of crackpot.

282
00:27:05,823 --> 00:27:07,693
- Kanpai.
- Kanpai.

283
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,793
Have a seat.

284
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,603
That's the other reason I came.

285
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:22,041
N.S.A. forwarded a copy
of Abdi's flash drive.

286
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:27,079
The prescribing physician is
Dr. Iulian Cornel, medical research.

287
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,914
That's why none of the
indicators went off.

288
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:32,415
- How long has this been happening?
- Two years.

289
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,388
- Banir...
- Well...

290
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:41,060
...possible Banir uses
Abdikarim as a middleman.

291
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,663
Their communications,
any information about possible Banir...

292
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,930
Goes into the river...

293
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:49,668
or so he thinks.

294
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:54,271
And Abdi pays Dr. Cornel.

295
00:27:59,243 --> 00:28:00,443
Evan.

296
00:28:04,515 --> 00:28:09,219
Ignorant... ignorant doctor in this?

297
00:28:10,254 --> 00:28:14,691
Well, except for one thing.
Dr. Cornel has a Kenyan wife.

298
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:20,799
- How much does he charge?
- 10k euro every month.

299
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:22,334
- And doesn't report it.
- Nope.

300
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:27,304
Now we're on the same page. The doctor's
protecting himself. You got the files?

301
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,275
- You know what?
- What?

302
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,378
This is cool.

303
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:34,780
Print 'em out. I don't like
to read off a monitor.

304
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,845
All right.

305
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:46,289
No answer?

306
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:52,862
Aasim.

307
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:07,644
Aasim. Aasim. Aasim.

308
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:15,654
You have a visa?

309
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,323
- Speak English?
- Yeah.

310
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,593
I need you to go... go to Bucharest.

311
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:26,963
I need you to find this... doctor.
I need you to get the medication?

312
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:34,037
Shave your beard and get...

313
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:37,040
European ways.

314
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,018
Better idea.

315
00:29:50,988 --> 00:29:54,391
Get this Cornel to come here.

316
00:29:56,861 --> 00:30:00,966
What if... if he give me problems?
If he does not want to come?

317
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:04,670
Tell him the family of his wife

318
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:08,638
will not be spared. Yeah,
that's good. That's good.

319
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:15,078
Here he is.

320
00:30:17,414 --> 00:30:19,818
"Dr. Iulian Cornel,

321
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:23,956
grant to develop novel therapeutic
agents b-thalassemia.

322
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:27,159
Sponsored Cooley's anemia foundation."

323
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:31,964
Bingo. Muhammad Banir,
you think you can hide?

324
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:34,998
Nobody can hide from the reaper.

325
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,702
Can we get in?

326
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:41,507
- Into what?
- Into the correspondence

327
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:45,875
between Banir and the doctor.
Cornel hasn't heard from Abdi...

328
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:50,347
so now he's wondering...
"Where's my payment?"

329
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:55,020
- It... it's possible, but...
- But what?

330
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,890
If this med is for Banir,

331
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,360
why hasn't anyone heard
from him in 20 years?

332
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,329
I can explain.

333
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:07,833
Banir thought I had an asset
in his group, a double.

334
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:11,837
That's what he was trying to get me to
give up. There was no fucking asset.

335
00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:15,238
I couldn't give it up even if I
wanted, but that was the deal.

336
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,710
After my extraction, I had my doubts,

337
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,948
so I sent some intelligence hinting
that Banir himself was the double,

338
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,917
a cable that would be intercepted
at the highest levels.

339
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:29,855
If he was still alive, I wanted
him off the playing field.

340
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:32,389
I drove him into the ground.

341
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:37,061
Everybody figured he was dead.

342
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,765
- I had my doubts.
- Why?

343
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:43,969
Because he's a true believer.
Guys like that don't just die.

344
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:47,639
You gotta... you gotta rip out
their hearts with your bare hands.

345
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,976
You've been giving this a lot
of thought, haven't you?

346
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,545
- Just once a day.
- Every day.

347
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,545
All day long.

348
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:03,186
Don't answer it.

349
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:15,231
Shit. Just stay there.

350
00:32:18,068 --> 00:32:20,645
Dr. Sanjar, I'm real busy right now.
I don't have the time.

351
00:32:20,746 --> 00:32:24,376
Evan, I don't want to leave it the way
it was left today. It was not right.

352
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:26,678
- It's all right.
- No, it's not.

353
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:30,849
I'm not going to let you push this aside.
We want to help you.

354
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:35,087
Come to my office, we'll sit down,
have a talk, prepare for the future.

355
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:37,956
It doesn't have to be tomorrow.
Whenever you like.

356
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:42,127
- Agreed?
- Yeah. Agreed.

357
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:45,362
- I'll see you then.
- I'll see you then.

358
00:32:47,497 --> 00:32:51,470
- You gonna tell me what that was about?
- It's nothing. Let's get drunk.

359
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,107
This goes back to when I
found you at Ruby Tuesdays,

360
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:58,076
- Doesn't it?
- Can't a man have any privacy?

361
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,146
All right, look,
I'm risking my job here,

362
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:05,684
but you've got another program running,
something you won't tell me about.

363
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:09,052
You gotta be straight.
You owe me that much.

364
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:27,804
Happy?

365
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:34,613
It's not so bad now... little things,
things that I can hide...

366
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:38,850
but that's a train that
only runs one way.

367
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,119
Everything up here?

368
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:45,490
Rotting. Bit by bit, it slips away.

369
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,427
- You've known this...
- I suspected.

370
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:52,898
About a year ago, something
in my head just... fell.

371
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:56,501
By the time you start showing symptoms,
the atrophy's done its damage,

372
00:33:56,601 --> 00:34:00,138
brain mass has decreased.
Three years, my guess. That's about it.

373
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:03,208
You know, I wanna know something.
Were they asking about me?

374
00:34:05,008 --> 00:34:08,831
Not to me directly, but yeah.
You're angry?

375
00:34:08,932 --> 00:34:12,884
Not at them. Well, actually,
maybe at them, but this whole damn thing.

376
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,987
Why me? Why the fuck me?

377
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:19,388
- I didn't do anything wrong!
- Ev, you still have time left.

378
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,127
Make the most of it.

379
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:26,398
Why waste it looking for someone
who may not even exist?

380
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:29,398
He does exist.

381
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:37,124
There is a window here.
It won't be open long,

382
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:41,079
and then it will close and Banir
will have gotten away with it.

383
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:45,250
And I am gonna do something
worth remembering

384
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,984
with what's left of my time.

385
00:35:24,787 --> 00:35:26,823
Could you please step out?

386
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:33,751
Mr. Lake, we're going back to the station.
Please get in the patrol car.

387
00:35:33,852 --> 00:35:37,300
I will drive you there.
Place your keys under the seat.

388
00:35:39,302 --> 00:35:40,605
What have I done?

389
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:43,969
State law requires physicians
to report all conditions

390
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:48,413
that might cause a loss of consciousness,
Mr. Lake. Your name is on this list.

391
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:51,249
Now if this is an error,
it will be corrected at the station.

392
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,716
Look, I work for the United
States government, just like you.

393
00:35:54,817 --> 00:35:58,336
Another officer will bring your car.
If there's someone you'd like to pick you up,

394
00:35:58,437 --> 00:36:02,325
you can call them from the station.
If you have a cellphone, you can call now.

395
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,665
What made him jump, the Kenyan?

396
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:11,670
All right, he's a conduit
for pharmaceuticals.

397
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,673
He's been protecting the location
of someone presumed dead.

398
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:18,474
He's been accused of this
Nigerian drug fraud scam.

399
00:36:19,376 --> 00:36:20,979
What makes him jump?

400
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:24,424
It had to be something else.
Something he knew.

401
00:36:24,525 --> 00:36:28,319
- Something he was afraid he'd give up.
- Yeah, something scary.

402
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:31,187
The money came in.

403
00:36:31,655 --> 00:36:35,193
10,000 Euros, Abdi's account.

404
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:39,162
And no one to pick it up. Shit,
I gotta hurry. The clock's running.

405
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,067
You're going to Romania?

406
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:45,137
How? Have you thought about
how you're gonna do it?

407
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:48,907
Go to Bucharest, collect the money,
track down the bad guy, charter a jet,

408
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:53,609
set her down at Andrew's air
force base. No, not in detail.

409
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:57,516
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

410
00:36:57,616 --> 00:37:00,885
- Let me come with you.
- I'm not helpless.

411
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,521
- I know, but do you have multiple I.D.?
- I have old passport...

412
00:37:03,622 --> 00:37:06,858
Old passport won't cut a deal
like this, not in today's security.

413
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,728
We'll need at least
three sets, all vetted.

414
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:12,964
- How long for the I.D's?
- Two days, three.

415
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,265
- What if I say no?
- No what?

416
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,134
No, you can't come.

417
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:21,671
Well then, Mr. secret agent man,
I might have to drop a dime on you.

418
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:25,908
You know, I half believe you would.

419
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:41,092
It's programmed to the
number I was given.

420
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:44,060
Only call if it's an emergency.

421
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:45,897
You have cash?

422
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:47,863
Yes.

423
00:37:48,932 --> 00:37:50,933
So this will be your car.

424
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:57,106
- Do you have...
- Don't tell me anything. I know nothing.

425
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,677
Do you have a gun?

426
00:38:02,312 --> 00:38:04,046
In the trunk.

427
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,559
Have you clarified your plan?

428
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,962
There's a woman meeting
us in Bucharest.

429
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:21,366
Oh. You are full of surprises.

430
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:26,735
Michelle Zubarain, used to be
a journalist, mid-east danger junkie.

431
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:31,543
Might even have been an agent.
She works out of Prague now.

432
00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:35,978
- She an old flame?
- Just someone I used to know.

433
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:41,186
- And?
- Just, you know, one step at a time.

434
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:43,986
Seeing what'll happen next.

435
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:59,868
Professor Dr. Iulian Cornel.

436
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:03,739
Nothing particularly
stands out about him.

437
00:39:04,341 --> 00:39:09,211
Keeps a low profile, community service,
sits on a couple of boards.

438
00:39:10,113 --> 00:39:11,883
What about his wife?

439
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,519
Angena? They met
through an aid program.

440
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:17,153
- Where?
- Mombasa.

441
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:20,826
- Sir.
- What?

442
00:39:20,926 --> 00:39:25,061
- This is a nonsmoking section.
- Let me just check something.

443
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:30,669
Yup, I am in Romania.
Are you out of your fucking mind?

444
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:34,269
- This whole country is a smoking section.
- Evan.

445
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:38,009
- Okay. Okay.
- Sir, there is a smoking area upstairs.

446
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,887
I'm putting it out!

447
00:39:40,388 --> 00:39:42,011
Jesus!

448
00:39:43,313 --> 00:39:46,015
Thank you for bringing
that to our attention.

449
00:39:48,117 --> 00:39:50,989
I know. I'm sorry, Michelle.
I'm sorry about that. It's the jetlag.

450
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:54,189
It's got me...
it's got me turned around.

451
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:56,574
It's all right.

452
00:39:56,675 --> 00:39:59,364
What's the best way to
approach Dr. Cornel?

453
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:03,968
In his office during business hours,
closed door, with colleagues nearby.

454
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,939
I've prepared an official cover.
You'll be my American colleagues.

455
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,405
Okay.

456
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:22,253
How did you and Michelle meet?
If I'm not being too forward.

457
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:27,356
No, it's not too forward. It just...
wasn't particularly glamorous.

458
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:32,628
How did you and Evan meet?
That's more interesting.

459
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,469
I was a...

460
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:42,006
non-official covert op in Cairo.

461
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:45,109
And I lost an asset...

462
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:50,248
the son of a cabinet minister.
My fuck-up. Ugly political situation.

463
00:40:50,348 --> 00:40:55,320
The agency just stepped back.
Then Evan Lake showed up.

464
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,789
Two days later, I was on a
plane back to Washington.

465
00:40:57,889 --> 00:41:02,158
They just needed to be reminded
we take care of our own.

466
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:09,134
- I was a believer then.
- You still have it, don't you?

467
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:12,668
- What?
- You know what I'm talking about.

468
00:41:15,238 --> 00:41:17,239
Show him, Evan.

469
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:24,347
Yeah, I caught a bullet
when I was extracted.

470
00:41:25,682 --> 00:41:28,653
He offered once to have
that bullet put in a ring...

471
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:31,187
If I'd agree to wear it on my finger.

472
00:41:32,322 --> 00:41:35,123
I bet you didn't know
he was such a romantic.

473
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:44,166
I've gotta get back to the room.
This flight really took it out of me.

474
00:41:50,607 --> 00:41:52,708
I'll see you later.

475
00:41:55,645 --> 00:41:57,980
Did you have to say that?

476
00:41:58,615 --> 00:42:02,518
- Did I embarrass you?
- You couldn't embarrass me.

477
00:42:48,765 --> 00:42:50,733
Everybody set?

478
00:43:11,354 --> 00:43:13,522
That's him in the glasses.

479
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,797
- Dr. Cornel?
- Da.

480
00:43:37,215 --> 00:43:39,815
- M-my office, please.
- Da.

481
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,854
Decitabine is not a prohibited drug,

482
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:45,790
- So I don't see why...
- Dr. Cornel, I'm here as a liaison.

483
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,926
This request has come
through official channels.

484
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:50,128
It originates from Washington, D.C.

485
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:52,031
Washington?

486
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:57,101
- English, please.
- We have an interest in this person,

487
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:59,468
Abdi Abdikarim.

488
00:44:00,303 --> 00:44:02,239
What kind of a name is that anyway?

489
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,575
He said he was Kenyan.

490
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:08,646
- What's your connection to him?
- I only met him once at a coffee shop.

491
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:11,449
- The rest was through the mails.
- When was that?

492
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:14,685
- Two years ago.
- You've been prescribing a rare, potent drug

493
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:17,822
to somebody you met once in
a coffee shop two years ago?

494
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:22,994
He had medical records. He was representing
someone else, but the name had been redacted.

495
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:25,597
You have no knowledge of
who's actually using this drug?

496
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:29,498
None whatsoever, but I did nothing wrong.
I did everything by the book.

497
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:34,403
20,000 Euros every two months.
Does that sound about right?

498
00:44:48,451 --> 00:44:51,954
And why should that
be a security concern?

499
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:56,825
Cornish... Cornish...

500
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,995
Cornish.

501
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:05,269
Cornel. Dr. Julian Cornel,

502
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:09,238
let us decide what is or
isn't a security concern.

503
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:11,640
Arrest him.

504
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:16,547
- Dr. Cornel, could you please stand up.
- What?

505
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:18,716
Turn around.

506
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:21,052
No, no, no, I can't be arrested.
I cannot be arrested.

507
00:45:21,152 --> 00:45:23,054
- You don't understand.
- Tell it to your lawyer.

508
00:45:23,154 --> 00:45:26,758
He came into my home last night.
My wife was terrified.

509
00:45:26,858 --> 00:45:28,726
- Who?
- He didn't give his name.

510
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:31,362
He said Abdi was dead. He was an Arab.

511
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:35,466
He wanted the decitabine and
wanted me to go to the patient.

512
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,767
- Where?
- Didn't say.

513
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:38,569
Why are you still here?

514
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:41,403
You asked for more money, didn't you?

515
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:44,308
- How much?
- 30,000.

516
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,979
You're a successful doctor.
You're going somewhere you don't know

517
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:54,316
to treat someone you don't know for a lousy
30,000 Euros. What am I missing here?

518
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:56,752
Well...

519
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,257
It's my wife.

520
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,394
She's from Kenya.

521
00:46:05,895 --> 00:46:08,573
They said they'll kill her
family if I didn't come.

522
00:46:08,674 --> 00:46:13,002
The Arab man who told you this,
is he planning on traveling with you?

523
00:46:14,704 --> 00:46:16,272
I assume so.

524
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:19,844
You think Cornel will contact
us when they call him?

525
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:23,881
Yeah, he'll call. We've got him
scared now. We're his only chance.

526
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:27,284
Is there really a Natalie
Negrescu at S.R.I.?

527
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:30,986
He's not gonna contact
the Romanian authorities.

528
00:46:46,568 --> 00:46:49,207
Get this Cornel.

529
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:52,644
He... he is a crook.

530
00:46:52,744 --> 00:46:56,480
30,000. Who does he think he is?

531
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,915
I wouldn't trust him if he wasn't.

532
00:47:01,753 --> 00:47:06,788
He only wants 15,000 now, so...

533
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:09,360
He has to come.

534
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,261
Can we get that much money?

535
00:47:11,661 --> 00:47:13,331
I will write the details.

536
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:17,301
You... you go send it
from the Internet cafe.

537
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,403
It will take at least...

538
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,507
at least a day, but first
we'll ask for more time.

539
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:26,043
You tell him... no. No, I...

540
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:29,011
I don't have time.

541
00:47:36,252 --> 00:47:37,653
Evan.

542
00:47:42,058 --> 00:47:43,459
Evan.

543
00:48:54,664 --> 00:48:56,732
31.

544
00:48:59,502 --> 00:49:01,737
44.

545
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,741
31.

546
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,144
35.

547
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:12,681
Fuck. 24.

548
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:17,519
17.

549
00:49:19,722 --> 00:49:21,490
10.

550
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:24,192
Three.

551
00:49:32,001 --> 00:49:33,768
Are you...

552
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:37,506
You warm enough?

553
00:49:41,544 --> 00:49:45,681
I asked you to tell me
if you were going out.

554
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:50,285
I got anxious, kept walking.

555
00:49:51,721 --> 00:49:53,924
But the thing was I...

556
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:58,560
I-I... I couldn't remember
the name of the hotel.

557
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:05,133
You left your wallet.

558
00:50:15,144 --> 00:50:17,579
It's just three blocks over.

559
00:50:21,851 --> 00:50:23,185
You get some sleep.

560
00:50:24,353 --> 00:50:26,522
You'll be fine.

561
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:32,029
It happens towards the end of the day.
Sundowning it's called.

562
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:37,766
Nobody knows why.
You get anxious, confused.

563
00:50:38,701 --> 00:50:42,137
I had to get out, go somewhere.

564
00:50:43,806 --> 00:50:46,308
You take your medication?

565
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:51,749
Do you feel better?

566
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:55,550
Yeah. Yeah, I just slipped.

567
00:50:56,085 --> 00:51:00,121
Lost track. I'm... I'm all right.

568
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:03,759
Dr. Cornel called.

569
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:07,331
The money will arrive tomorrow.

570
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:12,568
They said to be ready to travel in a
few days, had to get him a Kenyan visa.

571
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:17,573
- Banir's Arab friend?
- Yeah.

572
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:25,013
Do you remember...
what he looked like?

573
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:27,952
- Who?
- Banir.

574
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:32,320
Of course. I can see him now.

575
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:36,126
Back then when you were...

576
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:40,931
a captive, Banir wanted a name, right?

577
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:43,167
Why didn't you give him a name?

578
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:46,604
It didn't matter which name, any name.

579
00:51:46,704 --> 00:51:49,840
It just... pissed him off more,

580
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,373
hurt the man's pride.

581
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:54,945
If you'd have given him a name,

582
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:58,213
he probably would've said, "good"...

583
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:00,117
and let you go.

584
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:04,820
I didn't want to be the man who
gave up a name under questioning.

585
00:52:11,627 --> 00:52:14,732
Come on, hotel's this way. Let's go.
It's gonna start snowing.

586
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:18,936
I know where the damn hotel is.
Stop trying to put a bib on me, okay?

587
00:52:19,036 --> 00:52:20,769
Okay.

588
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,487
It's a quarter past.

589
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,692
Okay, he's got the money.

590
00:53:18,761 --> 00:53:20,862
Shit, he's seen us.

591
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:12,915
- The airplane ticket and the money.
- Okay.

592
00:54:16,085 --> 00:54:18,789
- And the passport.
- Just give me a second.

593
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:21,692
You are out of this.
You dodged a bullet.

594
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:24,726
Nothing's gonna happen
to you or your people.

595
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:26,862
Now you can go.

596
00:55:30,693 --> 00:55:32,496
Any word from Aasim?

597
00:55:32,596 --> 00:55:35,663
The doctor will arrive on Wednesday.

598
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:40,235
- After that... nothing?
- Not yet.

599
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:48,076
No, no. No, no.
Just a few more moments.

600
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:02,090
What was his phone number again?

601
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:08,096
254-41-834-5571.

602
00:56:08,564 --> 00:56:09,865
Where is that?

603
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:19,243
- Mombasa.
- The asshole of East Africa.

604
00:56:19,343 --> 00:56:22,679
That's exactly where someone
like Banir would end up.

605
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:25,182
That's where Cornel
will meet with Banir.

606
00:56:25,282 --> 00:56:27,883
- When?
- Tuesday.

607
00:56:29,418 --> 00:56:31,355
We gotta make Banir think this...

608
00:56:31,455 --> 00:56:33,457
- What was his name?
- Aasim.

609
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,058
...is still alive.

610
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:39,561
Well, all the messages
are texts, so we can text.

611
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:44,968
Yeah, Michelle?

612
00:56:45,868 --> 00:56:48,005
Yeah, me too.

613
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:51,039
Look, Milt needs a Kenyan visa.

614
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:55,310
As soon as possible.
And there's another thing.

615
00:56:57,046 --> 00:57:02,284
After the base is down, just tone
it down a little with a cotton ball.

616
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:05,455
Are you taking this down?

617
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:10,061
All right, this whole process should
take about two hours for the first time

618
00:57:10,161 --> 00:57:13,931
and will last the better
part of a shooting day.

619
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:17,534
Serban works on motion pictures
when he isn't helping us out.

620
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:21,471
So if you feel insecure or need
a little bit of an ego boost,

621
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:23,507
Serban is the man for you.

622
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:26,107
The world is not a pretty
place without makeup.

623
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:33,116
The eye color is pretty different.

624
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:37,085
No. No, I don't want contacts.

625
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:42,092
Fortunately, our man wears glasses,

626
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:46,127
so I've added a little tint to these.

627
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:55,539
Dr. Iulian Cornel.

628
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,673
I was able to expedite
your Kenyan visa.

629
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:02,880
Serban. What exactly did you see?

630
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,179
I didn't see anything.

631
00:58:07,718 --> 00:58:09,284
Thank you.

632
00:58:14,323 --> 00:58:18,195
Your visa. You might want to
keep it to yourself for a day.

633
00:58:18,295 --> 00:58:19,336
Why?

634
00:58:19,437 --> 00:58:22,597
Give Evan another day to
think about what he's doing.

635
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,334
He's been thinking
about it for 20 years.

636
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:28,470
22.

637
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:37,781
Evan has retired. It's his life,
his choice, but you...

638
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:41,184
no matter how this turns out,
it will end badly for you.

639
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:43,520
Your career will be over.

640
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,623
All my life, I wanted to
be in the foreign service.

641
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:50,558
It was killing me,
being strapped to a desk.

642
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:54,796
- You should tell him.
- I tried.

643
00:58:55,264 --> 00:58:57,832
He's made his choice.

644
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:42,710
What's his name? What is the name?

645
00:59:46,248 --> 00:59:48,149
You want to...

646
01:00:18,747 --> 01:00:21,118
Michelle had to run.

647
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:23,687
She was able to get
my visa. I have it.

648
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:27,657
I was watching TV. Something about
a body on university campus.

649
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:31,695
Let's pack up, go to a
hotel near the airport,

650
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:34,631
stay in the room until
the flight leaves.

651
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:38,602
Just before the flight,
text Banir from Aasim's phone,

652
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:42,136
Aasim says he's been
detained by security.

653
01:00:43,272 --> 01:00:47,945
What about Michelle?
Are you gonna tell Michelle?

654
01:00:48,245 --> 01:00:50,045
What did she ask?

655
01:00:51,313 --> 01:00:53,448
Did she say anything about me?

656
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:59,320
- No.
- Don't tell her how the story ends.

657
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:09,898
Flight 418 now boarding at gate seven.

658
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,937
Flight 418 now boarding at gate seven.

659
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:48,036
I am Dr. Cornel.

660
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,108
- Dr. Cornel.
- Yes.

661
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:52,542
- Julian Cornel?
- Yes.

662
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:56,847
I am Mbui. So glad you could come.
I'll take you to Dr. Wangari's office.

663
01:01:56,947 --> 01:01:59,214
Where is Aasim?

664
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:01,818
He is coming.

665
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:04,386
Flight 273 now arriving.

666
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:23,640
When did Mr. Ali Hariri
have his last transfusion?

667
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,142
Three days ago.

668
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:28,912
- When is he scheduled for another?
- Three days.

669
01:02:29,012 --> 01:02:30,478
Here at the clinic?

670
01:02:33,115 --> 01:02:36,720
Saeed Ali Hariri is being
treated at his own residence.

671
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:39,890
- I will see him here.
- Dr. Cornel,

672
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:41,892
you were given letter
with all explained.

673
01:02:41,992 --> 01:02:46,429
- We wrote this.
- I am just double checking.

674
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:49,232
Al-Hariri is not able
to leave his residence.

675
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:51,902
You requested additional
payment in the light of this.

676
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:56,339
Of course. Let me go through everything
tonight. These are for me, correct?

677
01:02:56,439 --> 01:03:00,944
Then tomorrow I will visit
Mr. Ali Hariri at his residence.

678
01:03:01,044 --> 01:03:04,881
- Will you be coming, doctor?
- Dr. Wangari will not be able to join us.

679
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:08,183
I'll pick you up at
the hotel, 4:00 p.m.

680
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:23,934
All right, I'll give you
750 for the Jericho,

681
01:03:24,034 --> 01:03:26,736
- 900 for the glock.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

682
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:28,805
- 1150 for the glock.
- 1150?

683
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:30,307
- Yeah.
- Okay, just stop.

684
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:32,943
Here's what we do. 900...
900 for the Jericho...

685
01:03:33,043 --> 01:03:34,611
- No, no, no, no, no.
- ...950 for the glock.

686
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:35,946
All right? No, that's fair.

687
01:03:36,046 --> 01:03:37,445
No, no, no, no,
it's not fair, it's not fair.

688
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:49,492
Mbui.

689
01:03:50,792 --> 01:03:54,332
Come, come. Come, come.

690
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:57,665
Closer, closer, closer.

691
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:05,842
Aasim is missing.

692
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:10,413
Abdi is dead. If there is a traitor
among us, I will find him.

693
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:13,081
Is it you? Is it you?

694
01:04:14,552 --> 01:04:16,974
- 800, 900.
- No.

695
01:04:17,074 --> 01:04:21,725
No? All right, look, this is 2,000 Euros
right here. 2,000 Euros right here, okay?

696
01:04:21,825 --> 01:04:24,894
Don't underestimate me.

697
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:28,965
I have survived much more than this.

698
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:32,002
I went shopping at the market.

699
01:04:32,102 --> 01:04:34,404
A Jericho 941...

700
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,271
and a glock.

701
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:41,843
How much?

702
01:04:43,812 --> 01:04:46,013
2,000 Euros.

703
01:04:46,982 --> 01:04:48,885
You got took.

704
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:52,690
Well, we've got Euros to spare.

705
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:55,391
Do you smell something?

706
01:04:56,091 --> 01:04:58,092
Mombasa.

707
01:04:59,394 --> 01:05:04,434
The other night when we were in the park
in Bucharest, I touched your jacket.

708
01:05:04,534 --> 01:05:09,106
You were wearing this...
this blue, like canvas jacket,

709
01:05:09,206 --> 01:05:13,441
but when I touched it,
it... it felt just like dog fur.

710
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:18,414
Isn't it strange when you can't
even trust your own fingers?

711
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:21,148
And don't ask me how I feel.

712
01:05:21,483 --> 01:05:23,386
I wouldn't think of it.

713
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:25,086
Crock.

714
01:05:28,056 --> 01:05:29,726
Evan.

715
01:05:29,826 --> 01:05:32,729
Crock is... gun.

716
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:35,965
No way I'll be able to bring
a gun with me tomorrow.

717
01:05:36,365 --> 01:05:40,067
Mbui frisked me today.
He'll frisk me again tomorrow.

718
01:05:40,502 --> 01:05:42,903
Well, how do you plan to do it?

719
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:47,176
It's been so long, thought about
it so long, I'm not sure.

720
01:05:47,776 --> 01:05:50,645
Maybe I'll just let the
moment guide me.

721
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:54,618
I've got a syringe and medication.
One's quick and painless,

722
01:05:54,718 --> 01:05:58,488
the other's a strychnine derivative...
excruciating, takes over an hour.

723
01:05:58,588 --> 01:06:00,891
Or maybe I'll just
get up close to him,

724
01:06:00,991 --> 01:06:04,026
slice him and let his
blood wash all over me.

725
01:06:05,326 --> 01:06:08,565
I don't feel comfortable
letting you go in there alone.

726
01:06:08,665 --> 01:06:12,602
- I'll be all right.
- Look, I... I picked this up at the market.

727
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:18,541
They're wireless crazy over here.
Jumped straight from tom-toms to cellphones.

728
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:23,746
Just tuck that in somewhere, I'll be able
to hear you and I'll get G.P.S. as well.

729
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:28,683
I brought a belt blade. I'll be able to
get that through, but that's about it.

730
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:36,290
- So that's that then?
- Yeah.

731
01:06:36,558 --> 01:06:40,564
Milt... Thanks for coming along.

732
01:06:40,864 --> 01:06:43,430
No problem, old sport.

733
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:18,666
If I'm not out in an hour,
do whatever you want.

734
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:44,759
Please.

735
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:49,499
- Did you sleep well?
- All right.

736
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:52,233
Sometimes the heat is a problem.

737
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:57,204
Come, doctor.

738
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:06,881
Open the briefcase.

739
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:08,811
Dr. Cornel.

740
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:10,613
Salaam Alaikum.

741
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:13,149
Salaam Alaikum, Saeed Ali Hariri.

742
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:16,319
Dr. Cornel, thank you.

743
01:09:16,419 --> 01:09:20,287
Thank you for coming.
Forgive me for not...

744
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:23,057
standing.

745
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:26,293
Mbui, some tea.

746
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:32,302
- And those... those dates.
- Mind if I sit?

747
01:09:32,402 --> 01:09:34,335
Oh, please.

748
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:43,112
Dr. Wangari has provided me
your records, your treatment history.

749
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:48,349
Last night I was in contact with
several of my colleagues. Thank you.

750
01:09:50,652 --> 01:09:54,791
I noticed you were scheduled three
months ago for a bone marrow transplant,

751
01:09:54,891 --> 01:09:58,862
but I found no record of the procedure.
Was there a problem with the donor?

752
01:09:58,962 --> 01:10:03,433
- It was too dangerous.
- No sibling donor was possible,

753
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:06,002
no compatible cousins.

754
01:10:06,102 --> 01:10:10,555
It is risky, but an unrelated
donor can be found

755
01:10:10,656 --> 01:10:14,908
based on H.L.B. and D.R.
histocompatibility.

756
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:23,951
The university hospital can assist in finding
such a donor. We have a large database.

757
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:29,058
Should have been done before.
It is more...

758
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:32,128
dangerous now, but we have no choice.

759
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:37,531
At present, transplantation is the
only possible curative therapy.

760
01:10:38,433 --> 01:10:42,405
And... It can be done here?

761
01:10:42,505 --> 01:10:44,405
Yes.

762
01:10:48,276 --> 01:10:53,082
Excuse me, I am not such a young man.
Where is the toilet?

763
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:55,818
Back and to the left.

764
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:59,486
- So sorry.
- Oh, please. Please.

765
01:11:26,481 --> 01:11:28,985
There is a problem with the toilet.

766
01:11:30,685 --> 01:11:31,952
Mbui.

767
01:11:37,993 --> 01:11:39,395
It won't flush.

768
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:42,830
- You pulled the chain?
- I pulled the chain.

769
01:11:43,765 --> 01:11:48,135
There is something stuck... in there.

770
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:22,937
I have to be honest.

771
01:12:25,073 --> 01:12:29,009
Your condition is far
worse than I imagined.

772
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:37,251
Your long-term chances
for survival are not good.

773
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:42,356
Neither are your short-term chances.

774
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:50,296
In fact, they are quite hopeless.

775
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:55,468
It's because I'm not a doctor.

776
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:04,111
My name isn't Julian Cornel...

777
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:07,448
and your name isn't Ali Hariri.

778
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:12,419
Your name... is Muhammad Banir.

779
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,234
Mr. Ruchowski.

780
01:13:29,105 --> 01:13:31,138
Evan Lake.

781
01:13:34,609 --> 01:13:37,978
- Mbui?
- He'll be all right.

782
01:13:39,614 --> 01:13:44,451
Where is your backup?
Your elite commandos.

783
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:48,655
Oh. You came alone.

784
01:13:54,362 --> 01:13:56,499
How did you find me?

785
01:13:56,599 --> 01:14:01,669
Through the request for experimental
thalassemia medication, decitabine.

786
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:06,309
- Your family medical history.
- It was you.

787
01:14:07,509 --> 01:14:11,080
You who sent me into hiding.

788
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:16,717
Even so for years and years
I live in rooms like this one.

789
01:14:18,386 --> 01:14:21,722
I would have gladly given
both my ears for my freedom.

790
01:14:25,261 --> 01:14:28,128
So my health...

791
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:31,300
- Is it really hopeless?
- Yes.

792
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,835
You would've died of anemia
just like your father.

793
01:14:39,207 --> 01:14:41,608
He was an intellectual scholar.

794
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:46,880
I... I've read quite a bit myself.

795
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:50,418
Yeah.

796
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:54,322
So...

797
01:14:57,727 --> 01:14:59,693
How are...

798
01:15:00,328 --> 01:15:02,329
How are you going to kill me?

799
01:15:03,698 --> 01:15:06,466
I-I... I don't know.

800
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:10,039
Good.

801
01:15:12,039 --> 01:15:13,406
So...

802
01:15:14,777 --> 01:15:16,777
We have some time.

803
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:19,880
Perhaps we can have that...

804
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:25,185
conversation that I wanted
to have that time years a-ago.

805
01:15:27,555 --> 01:15:30,357
You... you only kept giving
me your fake name. Why?

806
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:35,029
- I was making a point.
- What point?

807
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:39,499
What is it that you do now?

808
01:15:40,101 --> 01:15:45,041
This company?
Intelligence analyst, yes?

809
01:15:45,341 --> 01:15:48,208
Perhaps you've read
some of my writings?

810
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:54,951
I didn't know you were still active.

811
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:58,287
Oh, I-I-I... I contribute.

812
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:01,223
A number of web sites
not under my name.

813
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:05,661
Of course, you are
religious man, Mr. Lake?

814
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:08,130
No, I'm not religious.

815
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:12,134
I think you are. America, yeah?

816
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:14,036
You see yourself as
a religion... America.

817
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:18,038
I've written about this,
the American way of life.

818
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:21,110
Have you been to Greeley, Colorado?

819
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:24,313
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Sayyid Qutb...

820
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:28,617
Who went from Cairo to Colorado
state college in 1948.

821
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:31,554
He said Greeley was
like paradise on earth.

822
01:16:31,654 --> 01:16:36,459
What Qutb saw was Jahiliyyah?

823
01:16:36,559 --> 01:16:39,562
Decadence, promiscuity, pop music.

824
01:16:39,662 --> 01:16:41,961
"Baby, it's cold outside."

825
01:16:45,533 --> 01:16:48,371
Qutb was repulsed.

826
01:16:48,471 --> 01:16:53,109
The-the... the flirting and
the mixing of men and women,

827
01:16:53,209 --> 01:16:55,378
the disrespect... so no, he left.

828
01:16:55,478 --> 01:16:59,848
Went back to Egypt and
the movement was born.

829
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:02,716
The Muslim brotherhood.

830
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,355
My father knew him.

831
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:11,424
No, Nasser... Nasser executed him.

832
01:17:11,759 --> 01:17:13,861
It was too late.

833
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:23,003
- 45. 38.
- It was too late.

834
01:17:23,905 --> 01:17:26,208
Fundamentalism,

835
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:29,211
- Mr. Lake, of the prophet...
- 170.

836
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,047
- ...was social justice!
- 38.

837
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:35,916
Better schools, better jobs, Mr. Lake.

838
01:17:36,651 --> 01:17:39,153
This doesn't just... just end.

839
01:17:40,488 --> 01:17:43,492
Are you still a believer?

840
01:17:44,392 --> 01:17:46,192
Do you still believe?

841
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:50,333
I don't. My faith, it was...

842
01:17:50,433 --> 01:17:53,135
it was taken from me.

843
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:56,770
You think I'm playing
games with you, Mr. Lake?

844
01:17:58,607 --> 01:18:01,343
You think we are playing games?!

845
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:04,981
- My name is Charles Ruchowski...
- While mullahs, ayatollahs, they get rich.

846
01:18:05,081 --> 01:18:08,251
They have their orgies,
imprison their opponents.

847
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:09,785
- Why? Why?!
- I'm Charles Ruchowski.

848
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:12,588
My name is Charles Ruchowski.

849
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:16,190
I'm a representative
for spirit systems.

850
01:18:18,459 --> 01:18:20,729
The only hope

851
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:24,865
for Islam now is Marx.

852
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:28,737
Social justice.

853
01:18:28,837 --> 01:18:32,009
We like the fear.
I like the fear. I like the fear.

854
01:18:33,309 --> 01:18:36,412
Our believers, not so many.

855
01:18:36,512 --> 01:18:41,882
No, the truly dangerous people
are the ones who follow orders.

856
01:18:41,982 --> 01:18:44,318
Do you think it made any difference?

857
01:18:45,353 --> 01:18:48,922
What you did! You!

858
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:54,529
Do you?

859
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,804
Now, what is the name

860
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:04,338
of the source, Mr. Lake?!

861
01:19:08,542 --> 01:19:11,013
You are sick too.

862
01:19:11,213 --> 01:19:13,813
I see it, your face.

863
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:16,916
You have a disease of the blood.

864
01:19:17,485 --> 01:19:19,722
My disease is in the brain.

865
01:19:19,822 --> 01:19:21,922
What sort of disease?

866
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:25,859
I'm forgetting things.

867
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:31,798
There is a lot to forget.

868
01:19:38,972 --> 01:19:41,574
It's the time for prayer.

869
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,883
Will you... please help me?

870
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:50,817
No, I won't do that!

871
01:19:52,987 --> 01:19:54,755
So...

872
01:19:57,959 --> 01:20:00,994
So what are you going to do... to do?

873
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:08,304
I'm going to leave.

874
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:12,439
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

875
01:20:14,909 --> 01:20:17,344
- Ma'a Salama.
- Ma'a Salama.

876
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:31,525
Evan.

877
01:20:39,434 --> 01:20:41,069
Milt.

878
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:42,769
What happened?

879
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:51,811
- Was it worth it?
- Yeah, it was worth it.

880
01:20:52,313 --> 01:20:54,814
You should've heard him scream.

881
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:58,652
Put the car in gear.

882
01:21:11,966 --> 01:21:16,470
God, I hate this time of day.
It's the worst.

883
01:21:17,805 --> 01:21:20,106
You want to have a drink?

884
01:21:42,263 --> 01:21:45,065
Outside. Let's walk.

885
01:21:46,901 --> 01:21:50,039
Later on... you wanna talk about it?

886
01:21:50,339 --> 01:21:55,344
- What are you gonna do?
- Go home, I guess. So should you.

887
01:21:55,544 --> 01:21:59,447
- What home?
- Oh come on, don't be melodramatic.

888
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:02,885
You'll retire. You're young,
there's tons of things you could do.

889
01:22:02,985 --> 01:22:05,087
Or don't retire.
They won't put it together...

890
01:22:05,187 --> 01:22:09,339
Bucharest, Mombasa.
They won't want to.

891
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,892
Nah. It was always my dream to...

892
01:24:16,617 --> 01:24:19,619
Salaam Alaikum, asshole.

893
01:24:24,759 --> 01:24:28,061
That boy you shot was my friend.

894
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:34,102
What the fuck does that mean?

895
01:24:34,202 --> 01:24:36,202
- Come closer. Come on.
- Okay.

896
01:26:16,771 --> 01:26:19,072
What the hell are you doing here?

897
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:23,176
Haven't you heard?

898
01:26:25,246 --> 01:26:29,275
The C.I.A. fell from the Berlin
wall and all the president's men

899
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:31,851
can't put it back together again!

900
01:26:33,354 --> 01:26:36,825
It's broke! Not reliable.
Not trustworthy.

901
01:26:36,925 --> 01:26:41,129
Can't stand up to the
white house. Backstabbers.

902
01:26:41,229 --> 01:26:47,233
Watching porn, tapping phones.
Best and brightest quit or retired.

903
01:26:47,802 --> 01:26:53,807
What in the name of Jesus Christ nailed
to the cross are you doing here?

904
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:00,446
Values.

905
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:04,620
The C.I.A. has taken some hits,

906
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,755
some deserved.

907
01:27:06,855 --> 01:27:10,092
We've been down on the canvas,
but we're on our feet again,

908
01:27:10,192 --> 01:27:13,329
because we've got no choice and
because our country needs us

909
01:27:13,429 --> 01:27:16,095
and because we've got what?

910
01:27:18,332 --> 01:27:19,766
Values.
