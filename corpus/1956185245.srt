WILL GARDNER: As I
pondered in silence,

5
00:01:06,805 --> 00:01:16,337
returning upon my poems,
considering, lingering long,

6
00:01:16,424 --> 00:01:26,042
a phantom arose before me
with distrustful aspect,

7
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:30,177
in beauty, age--

12
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:39,055
Looks like the
guy is a squatter.

13
00:01:39,142 --> 00:01:39,925
Bathroom is locked.

14
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:41,666
No key.

15
00:01:41,753 --> 00:01:42,754
Unarmed?

16
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:43,538

Open the door.

27
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:27,016
Come out slowly,
with your hands up.

28
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:28,235
Open the door.

30
00:02:29,497 --> 00:02:31,107
Buddy, you can't stay in there.

31

WILL GARDNER: I
should be telling

32
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:34,937
this with a sigh, somewhere
ages and ages hence.

33
00:02:35,024 --> 00:02:37,113
POLICE OFFICER: If you
don't open the door, sir,

34
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,680
I'm going to have
to break it down.

36
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:42,834

POLICE OFFICER: Let
me find me something

38
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:45,774
to knock this door down.

39
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:49,212
WILL GARDNER: And I, I took
the one less traveled by.

40
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:51,083
And that has made
all the difference.

41
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,844

we are too well
pleased with ourselves,

53
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:20,635
when our dreams have come
true, because we have dreamed

54
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:25,770
too little, when we
arrive safely because we

55
00:03:25,857 --> 00:03:29,209
sailed too close to the shore.

56
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:32,168
Do you see that
guy loading his RPG?

57
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:33,387
Got him.

I'm good.

00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:28,137
I'm good.

I owe you.

You owe me shit.

Hey, Sammy.

What?

104
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,167
They got him turned around, man.

105
00:04:58,254 --> 00:04:59,081
No, Ghost.

106
00:04:59,168 --> 00:04:59,864
We wait here, man.

What are you doing?

I'm going to loan you a
pair of men's underwear.

00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:04,129
You stain them, you own them.

You keep them.

112
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:05,348
Yeah.

I've got it, Ghost.

118
00:05:13,748 --> 00:05:14,748
I've got it.

119
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:16,098
There you go.

120
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:16,925
Bring it.

121
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:17,708
There you go.

122
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:20,058
Ah!

123
00:05:20,145 --> 00:05:22,974
[grunts] This is the the last
motherfucker I'd thought I'd be

124
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:26,413
slung over my shoulder.

125
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,110
I said I'm not
feeling it, Ghost.

126
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:30,112
Well, you can tell
everybody you led the way.

127
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,243
I'm the First Sergeant.

128
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,438
I say we stay the fuck here.

129
00:05:32,462 --> 00:05:33,158
Atta boy.

00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:34,116
Stack up!

00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:35,203
Why?

132
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:40,078
You're an ass.

Put the cuffs.

150
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,934
Get him up.

152
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:12,546

No!

156
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:17,986
Don't do this!

157
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:19,379
Don't do this!

158
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:20,989
I need a medic!

159
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:24,384
I need a medic!

160
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:25,907
Believe this guy?

161
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:27,082
Something else.

162
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:34,176
[sighs] All right, buddy.

163
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:35,873
Let's see.

164
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,745
You've got anything
shoved in your pockets?

165
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:39,050
Anything going to prick me?

166
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:40,269
Huh?

167
00:06:40,356 --> 00:06:41,749
WILL GARDNER: As
to me, directing

168
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:46,841
like flame, its eyes
with finger pointing

169
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:49,147
to many immortal songs.

170
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:51,149
Take a break.

171
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:58,200
WILL GARDNER: A menacing voice,
what singest thou, it said.

172
00:06:58,287 --> 00:07:03,118
Knowest thou not there is but
one theme forever enduring

173
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:04,946
bards.

174
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:08,689
And that is the theme of war.

175
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:10,995
The fortune of battles.

176
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:15,609
The making of perfect soldiers.

177
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,708
Hey, Tony!

178
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:29,274
What you doing?

179
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:30,450
Let me get that for you.

180
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:31,537
He's got it.

181
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:37,587
Looks like they knew you huh?

182
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:38,674
That's funny.

183
00:07:41,156 --> 00:07:42,636
Who tagged it?

184
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:44,551
I don't know.

185
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:48,642
Locals, gang bangers, who knows?

186
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:50,252
Who's the kid?

187
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:51,339
He's Pete.

188
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:56,432
You got any paying work?

189
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,825
No.

190
00:07:57,912 --> 00:08:00,218
And none coming down
the line either.

191
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:03,178
Sorry about that, bud.

192
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:06,137
You said Venice
Boulevard moved out.

193
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:08,575
Extended their lease.

194
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:11,578
How about that
building you just bought?

195
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:12,665
It's in escrow.

196
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,279
All right.

197
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:20,587
Did you get a new bike?

198
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:22,502
Yeah.

199
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:25,287
You mind if we settle up on
the last little bit of work?

200
00:08:25,374 --> 00:08:29,465
[sighs] Pete, take five.

201
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:31,946
You want to settle up?

202
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,513
Of course.

203
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,472
Come here.

204
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:48,963
[sighs] There you go.

205
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,792
Actually it comes
to a whole lot more.

206
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:52,619
That's it.

207
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:54,534
We're settled.

208
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:56,623
I'm not clear.

209
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,581
You're not clear.

210
00:08:58,668 --> 00:09:00,104
OK.

211
00:09:00,191 --> 00:09:03,151
Well, you want me to
explain it to you?

212
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:04,892
You spent the two
weeks that you were

213
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:07,459
meant to be working doing
pull ups off the side

214
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,113
of that building in the alley.

215
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,463
And I caught you
reading more than once.

216
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,813
During my breaks.

217
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,770
What breaks?

218
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:14,684
What are you, union?

219
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:16,251
There's no breaks.

220
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:17,881
You're working four
to five hours a day.

221
00:09:17,905 --> 00:09:18,645
If it falls on your
lunch, that's fine.

222
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:20,429
But there's no breaks.

223
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:22,997
The VA docs says to exercise
to keep my heart rate up

224
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:24,476
so I get oxygen to my brain.

225
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,608
Yeah.

226
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:27,567
I don't want to get into it.

227
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:29,588
And they told me to read to
take my mind off other things.

228
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:34,791
So can-- can you just pay me
the rest of what you owe me?

229
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:41,015
Look, I'm going to make
this plain and simple for you.

230
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:44,584
I am not paying you to get fit.

231
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:46,368
OK?

232
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:48,588
You want to fuck around,
there's plenty other assholes

233
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:50,546
you can work for.

234
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:53,027
Not like you.

235
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:58,772
[sighs] You're just like all
of them, looking for a handout.

236
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:01,557
My injury's real, bro.

237
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:04,038
Your injury's real?

238
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:07,563
Then you should do
what your doctor said.

239
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,740
He told you to read, bro?

240
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:14,831
Then get a job as a librarian.

241
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:15,789
You know what?

242
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:17,747
You built the house.

243
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:18,705
Own it.

244
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:20,315
Pay me what you owe me.

245
00:10:20,402 --> 00:10:21,098
Oh.

246
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:21,751
Now.

247
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:22,838
Now?

248
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:41,510
You enjoy living in a
country where you can mouth off

249
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:44,426
to whoever, whenever?

250
00:10:44,513 --> 00:10:46,689
You're welcome.

251
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:47,995
Thank you for that.

252
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:49,300
Thank you for your service.

253
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:54,436
Now get off my fucking premises.

254
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:55,785
Walk away, Will.

255
00:10:55,872 --> 00:10:58,005
[footsteps]

256
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:03,706
Pete, get back to it.

257
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:05,186
[ambient beach noise]

258
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:09,451
You were the bigger man.

259
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:10,539
Yeah, I mean it.

260
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:11,540
You did the right thing.

261
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:12,759
You walked away.

262
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:15,631
I wanted to beat his ass.

263
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:18,590
Understandable.

264
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,940
Well, it's good
to know I still

265
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:21,419
got a little fight left in me.

266
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:22,769
I was ready to go, man.

267
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:23,639
I bet.

268
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:25,815
[laughs]

269
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:28,470
And he was a big
son-of-a-bitch.

270
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:29,732
How big?

271
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:31,386
6'4 or 6'5.

272
00:11:31,473 --> 00:11:32,169
6'5?

273
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:32,822
Yeah?

274
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:33,909
Ish.

275
00:11:36,043 --> 00:11:37,479
You know I ain't a lover.

276
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:38,436
Yeah, I know.

277
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:39,307
Hell no.

278
00:11:39,394 --> 00:11:40,308
Hell no.

279
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:41,831
He was a bad ass.

280
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:43,833
You know, Ghost, you
could cage fight.

281
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,314
Well, you know I'm
younger than I look.

282
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:47,097
Hey, come on, man.

283
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:48,403
You look great.

284
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,230
You mean that?

285
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:50,535
I mean that.

286
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:51,623
Fuck, yeah, I mean it.

287
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,062
You could model, probably.

288
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:57,368
Look at this face.

289
00:11:57,455 --> 00:11:59,719
You could model.

290
00:11:59,806 --> 00:12:01,155
Great way to meet girls.

291
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:08,684
I bet this guy
meets a lot of girls.

292
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:10,817
[laughs] Hell, yeah, he does.

293
00:12:10,904 --> 00:12:12,166
All right.

294
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:15,952
Now they say that
you ain't drunk

295
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:20,652
if you can lay on the
ground without holding on.

296
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,740
And who's "they"?

297
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:23,786
The experts.

298
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:24,787
OK.

299
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:27,616
Let's see.

300
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:28,443
Oh, shit.

301
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,183
I'm sober.

302
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,793
[laughs]

303
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,403
All right.

304
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,903
Hands down on the board
beside your shoulders.

305
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:35,450
OK.

306
00:12:35,537 --> 00:12:36,819
Palms down, like you're
going to do a push-up.

307
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:38,453
All right.

308
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,847
And you thrust your
upper body up in the sky--

309
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:42,587
You look like you're
fucking a crab hole.

310
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:47,592
--and you sweep your
legs underneath you, and--

311
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:50,465
[laughs] I hope you can swim.

312
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:52,032
Why?

313
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:54,469
Because you ain't even
on the board, Ghost.

314
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:55,556
Oh, shit.

315
00:12:58,255 --> 00:12:59,255
Yeah.

316
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:03,086
Oh, hey.

317
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:03,739
Give me a second.

318
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:04,479
Hey.

319
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:05,567
Hey, hey.

320
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:07,917
Ghost, don't go over here.

321
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:09,266
Now those are friends of mine.

322
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:10,920
I see them down
here all the time.

323
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:12,007
Ghost.

324
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:15,446
What are you talking about?

325
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:17,884
Why would you say that?

326
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:20,234
Listen to me.

327
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:21,539
You're not looking for him.

328
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:27,589
So you leave him alone.

329
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:28,676
I mean it.

330
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,680
Ghost?

331
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:35,945
Hm?

332
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:37,512
[pensive music]

333
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:45,520
[footsteps]

334
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:52,092
You'll be all right.

335
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:57,488
Wait!

336
00:13:57,575 --> 00:14:00,361
You-- you forgot--
you forgot your kiss!

337
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:02,493
His lips must
be getting tired.

338
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,626
I ain't going to
watch a soldier beg.

339
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:05,409
Pisses me off.

340
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:06,410
Let's pass him.

341
00:14:06,497 --> 00:14:09,631
Moving, on the right.

342
00:14:09,718 --> 00:14:11,111
Spare some change.

343
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:12,895
A comedian.

344
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:14,027
Aw, man!

345
00:14:14,114 --> 00:14:15,942
I'm just screwing with you.

346
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:17,813
Yo, smile!

347
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,163
It's a celebration.

348
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,470
What we celebrating?

349
00:14:22,557 --> 00:14:24,602
That we're rich.

350
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:29,303
Did not God choose the poor of
this world to be rich in faith,

351
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,957
and heirs to the
kingdom which he

352
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:33,829
promised to those who love him?

353
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:34,830
The who and the what?

354
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,005
The what?

355
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:38,399
Are you military?

356
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:39,356
'Nam.

357
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:40,792
'71.

358
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,490
Is that boonie
part of your uniform?

359
00:14:42,577 --> 00:14:43,621
Was.

360
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,146
So what's all that crap on it?

361
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:48,104
Shit I've collected.

362
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:51,542
Well, can you clean it up
and show a little respect?

363
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:53,805
You do that?

364
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,807
What, you don't agree?

365
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,374
This going to take long?

366
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:58,656
I got a 2 o'clock
tee-time and 18 hole--

367
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,986
Go ahead.

368
00:15:00,073 --> 00:15:01,393
Hey, is this thing
in park, Ghost?

369
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,254
Bless you, brother.

370
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:17,917
It enrages me and
it breaks my heart

371
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:21,616
to see people that serve this
country standing on the streets

372
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:22,703
begging for scraps.

373
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:23,747
You with me?

374
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:37,023
I know that you know
how to wear this.

375
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,112
But just in case you forgot.

376
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:44,117
You wear any piece
of this uniform,

377
00:15:44,204 --> 00:15:46,902
you stand tall proud, hooah?

378
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,035
Hooah.

379
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:51,472

00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:49,201
Anyway, remember Woody?

566
00:33:56,556 --> 00:34:00,647
[SINGING] Helmet for a pillow.

567
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:03,302
Ground is our bed.

568
00:34:03,389 --> 00:34:05,913
I watch your six, and
you'll watch mine,

569
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,612
so we don't wake up dead.

570
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:16,663
We're miles away from all we
love, brothers side by side.

571
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:23,800
We all know why we're here,
why we bleed and died.

572
00:34:23,887 --> 00:34:29,806
We fight for freedom,
for the mini and youth,

573
00:34:29,893 --> 00:34:37,858
lay down our lives, feel the
rain, standing for the truth.

574
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:43,690
So don't you ever worry,
sleep easy and sleep tight,

575
00:34:43,777 --> 00:34:51,393
'cause we are here, protecting
you, keeping watch till night.

576
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:57,617
We're simple soldiers,
doing what we do.

577
00:34:57,704 --> 00:35:04,928
Oh, just simple
soldiers, yeah, yeah.

578
00:35:05,015 --> 00:35:06,582
We would did for you.

579
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:14,590
We would die for you.

580
00:35:33,087 --> 00:35:35,829
That was him.

581
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:36,916
Crazy.

582
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:45,230
[SINGING] roll my windows down,
and cruise down a back road--

583
00:35:45,317 --> 00:35:47,971
Bryan Cranston, that actor.

584
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:49,538
You lie.

585
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:50,452
MARYANNE [ON PHONE]:
And he rode right by me,

586
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:52,019
I swear it was him.

587
00:35:52,106 --> 00:35:53,020
Bryan Cranston, the
"Breaking Bad" guy.

588
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:54,587
Shuts up.

589
00:35:54,674 --> 00:35:56,545
Oh my god, he's one
hunk of a redheaded man.

590
00:35:56,632 --> 00:35:58,330
Why didn't you pull him over?

591
00:35:58,417 --> 00:36:00,767
Yeah, that's a great idea.

592
00:36:00,854 --> 00:36:03,335
Like I'm going to pull
over Bryan Cranston.

593
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:04,466
Why not?

594
00:36:04,553 --> 00:36:05,380
MARYANNE [ON PHONE]: Oh, please.

595
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:06,381
Oh, I would have.

596
00:36:06,468 --> 00:36:07,817
I love me some ginger.

597
00:36:13,649 --> 00:36:14,346
OK.

598
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:15,608
You still there?

599
00:36:15,695 --> 00:36:17,262
Yeah.

600
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:18,437
Sweetheart, are you OK?

601
00:36:18,524 --> 00:36:19,655
MARYANNE [ON PHONE]: Yes.

602
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:22,136
I am, I really--

603
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:23,703
I needed this, Emmers.

604
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:24,791
I did.

605
00:36:24,878 --> 00:36:26,358
I hated that frickin' job.

606
00:36:26,445 --> 00:36:28,447
And that dingleberry
I had to answer to.

607
00:36:28,534 --> 00:36:35,280
My life for so long it's
just been so dang boring.

608
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:36,846
You just need a man.

609
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:38,848
MARYANNE [ON PHONE]:
Well, men don't like me.

610
00:36:38,935 --> 00:36:40,415
Men like you.

611
00:36:40,502 --> 00:36:43,157
Men like strippers,
they like pole grinders,

612
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:46,987
girls who twerk for a living.

613
00:36:47,074 --> 00:36:49,468
It's brutal.

614
00:36:49,555 --> 00:36:52,340
Look, Emmers, I know, I
know, it was impulsive of me.

615
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:54,995
To just storm out
like that, but I --

616
00:36:55,082 --> 00:36:57,650
I just had to, I had
to had a break away,

617
00:36:57,737 --> 00:37:00,043
free myself from all the shit.

618
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,828
You know?

619
00:37:01,915 --> 00:37:07,660
And it feels good.

620
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:10,837
'Cause it's
dangerous, I like it.

621
00:37:10,924 --> 00:37:12,404
I like it.

622
00:37:12,491 --> 00:37:17,017
Feels like I'm just
living on the edge.

623
00:37:17,104 --> 00:37:20,063
I just hope that running away
was the right thing, you know?

624
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,501
MARYANNE[ON PHONE]: Yeah,
well, it is, I know it is.

625
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:24,416
EMILY [ON PHONE]: You
know what you should do?

626
00:37:24,503 --> 00:37:27,027
Something you never do.

627
00:37:27,114 --> 00:37:27,854
You should just--

628
00:37:27,941 --> 00:37:28,985
What?

629
00:37:29,072 --> 00:37:29,899
EMILY [ON PHONE]: You ready?

630
00:37:29,986 --> 00:37:30,857
Yeah, I'm ready.

631
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:33,338
Let your hair down.

632
00:37:33,425 --> 00:37:35,340
Yeah, no, I should.

633
00:37:35,427 --> 00:37:36,471
Can you imagine?

634
00:37:36,558 --> 00:37:38,343
I'll just let it down.

635
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,996
Now.

636
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:43,043
I don't wear it down,
I wear it up, and I--

637
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,740
and I like it up, so--.

638
00:37:44,827 --> 00:37:46,414
EMILY [ON PHONE]: This is
the new you, Mary-Anne.

639
00:37:46,438 --> 00:37:48,353
You want to live dangerously?

640
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,963
Do you?

641
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,095
Then grab danger by
the balls, and do it.

642
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:53,488
Do it.

643
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:55,142
Jeez Louise.

644
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:56,230
Fine.

645
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:57,317
Fine.

646
00:37:59,973 --> 00:38:01,540
Oh, good Lord, I
don't know about that.

647
00:38:01,627 --> 00:38:03,237
No, I don't think so.

648
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:04,804
So where are you at now?

649
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:07,197
Fixing to pass Las Cruces.

650
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,330
Florida, here I come.

651
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:10,636
It's going to be fun.

[motorcycle revving]

653
00:38:15,815 --> 00:38:17,556
What on earth was that?

654
00:38:17,643 --> 00:38:19,558
That's him, that's him!

655
00:38:19,645 --> 00:38:20,559
That's him!

656
00:38:20,646 --> 00:38:21,908
That's Bryan Cranston!

657
00:38:21,995 --> 00:38:24,084
He must be going
100 miles an hour.

658
00:38:24,171 --> 00:38:25,651
So hot.

659
00:38:25,738 --> 00:38:26,434
EMILY [ON PHONE]: Try
and stay with him.

660
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:27,522
I'm trying.

661
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:29,132
I'm trying, he's too fast.

662
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:30,979
Oh my god, Mary-Anne,
don't let him get away.

00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:37,184
[SHOUTING] Bryan!

00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:43,189
Wait!

666
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:47,890
Are you kidding me right now?

[beep, beep]

668
00:38:49,414 --> 00:38:51,329
Come on.

669
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:52,416
Jesus.

670
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,148
Hi, um, just $12, please.

671
00:39:37,549 --> 00:39:39,942
You sure are pretty.

672
00:39:40,029 --> 00:39:40,552
What's that?

673
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:42,380
Oh.

674
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:44,294
Thank you, that's, um--

675
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,426
thank you.

676
00:39:45,513 --> 00:39:48,037
You're, uh-- you're so creative.

677
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:55,654
What is that you're whittling?

678
00:39:55,741 --> 00:39:57,569
A spearhead.

679
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:02,051
Coming along very nicely.

680
00:40:13,628 --> 00:40:15,108
Miss?

681
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:16,694
Yeah, I'm sorry, I
don't have time to chat.

682
00:40:16,718 --> 00:40:19,329
I'm really-- I'm trying
to catch somebody.

683
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,592
Would you like some candy?

684
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:24,596
Ew.

685
00:40:24,683 --> 00:40:25,771
That's ew.

686
00:40:56,497 --> 00:40:57,497
Hey?

687
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,328
Excuse me?

688
00:41:01,415 --> 00:41:03,243
Yoo-hoo?

689
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,419
Excuse me, Mr. Cranston?

690
00:41:05,506 --> 00:41:08,335
All right, you OK?

691
00:41:08,422 --> 00:41:11,294
You all right there?

692
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:14,863
I was coming in pretty quick.

693
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:18,737
Shit, I might've
clipped its hind leg.

694
00:41:18,824 --> 00:41:25,047
Your beard is amazing.

695
00:41:25,134 --> 00:41:26,875
Yeah?

696
00:41:26,962 --> 00:41:29,269
It's kind of like carrying
a porcupine on your chin.

697
00:41:29,356 --> 00:41:30,356
Oh.

698
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:34,666
It must be for a role.

699
00:41:37,146 --> 00:41:40,976
You think the dog was hurt, or?

700
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:43,979
Well, it's hard to tell.

701
00:41:44,066 --> 00:41:47,592
Took off running so damned fast.

702
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:49,724
MARY-ANNE: At least
you kept straight.

703
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:51,900
Better the dog than you.

704
00:41:51,987 --> 00:41:52,988
That is the upside.

705
00:41:57,863 --> 00:41:58,863
So are you--

706
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:03,956
you working on anything new, or?

707
00:42:04,043 --> 00:42:05,523
Huh?

708
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:09,614
What, no, I'm just
being fan, a silly fan.

709
00:42:09,701 --> 00:42:12,442
That's--

710
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,922
Come here, boy!

711
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:20,319
Come here, boy!

712
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:28,067
[whimpering]

713
00:42:28,154 --> 00:42:42,255
[barking]

714
00:42:42,342 --> 00:42:44,692
That was just me.

715
00:42:44,779 --> 00:42:47,303
Come here, boy.

716
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:50,263
Come here, boy.

717
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,350
Come on.

718
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:57,531
I sure do you like your scooter.

719
00:42:57,618 --> 00:42:58,837
You know bikes?

720
00:42:58,924 --> 00:43:00,621
Well, I'm a Texas girl.

721
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:03,798
It's either real
horses, or steel horses.

722
00:43:03,885 --> 00:43:05,104
No choice.

723
00:43:05,191 --> 00:43:09,282
Got to ride one or the other.

724
00:43:09,369 --> 00:43:10,718
No shit.

725
00:43:10,805 --> 00:43:12,241
It's hot, in the car.

726
00:43:18,552 --> 00:43:20,032
Sure you don't want one?

727
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:22,251
Ice cold.

728
00:43:22,338 --> 00:43:24,297
I'm all good, thanks.

729
00:43:24,384 --> 00:43:26,691
Let's see, where are we?

730
00:43:26,778 --> 00:43:28,518
We should be somewhere
right around there.

731
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:34,655
It was pretty easy
to get turned around

732
00:43:34,742 --> 00:43:37,092
on these country roads.

733
00:43:37,179 --> 00:43:38,746
Yeah.

734
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:40,792
I'm Mary-Anne Mackey.

735
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:42,445
People call me Ghost.

736
00:43:44,926 --> 00:43:47,320
People call you Ghost?

737
00:43:47,407 --> 00:43:48,190
Again.

738
00:43:48,277 --> 00:43:50,584
That's amazing.

739
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:52,325
Low profile, I like it.

740
00:43:52,412 --> 00:43:55,720
Well, I got it because
nobody ever sees me coming.

741
00:43:55,807 --> 00:43:59,419
They'd sure hear you, though.

742
00:43:59,506 --> 00:44:00,506
Because of the scooter.

743
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:07,862
You be careful out
there, Mary-Anne Mackey.

744
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:11,387
I should be at work right now.

746
00:44:14,564 --> 00:44:15,564
I up and quit.

00:44:19,004 --> 00:44:21,049
Tell you something, Mr. Ghost.

748
00:44:24,052 --> 00:44:25,837
Five days a week
I woke up at 6:00

749
00:44:25,924 --> 00:44:32,278
AM sharp to classic iPhone
Marimba ringtone number one.

750
00:44:32,365 --> 00:44:39,111
I make it 1,870 hours
a year sitting in an 8

00:44:39,198 --> 00:44:42,462
by 12 cubicle turning
some son of a bitch rich.

752
00:44:42,549 --> 00:44:45,900
Only thing I had to look forward
to was Monday through Friday,

753
00:44:45,987 --> 00:44:48,468
somewhere between 3:25 and
3:30 Cleve the office boy,

754
00:44:48,555 --> 00:44:50,949
he'd make a Starbucks
run, bring me back

00:44:51,036 --> 00:44:55,649
a venti, two pump, caramel
macchiato, extra hot.

756
00:44:55,736 --> 00:45:02,134
I'm a single, hard working,
professional woman,

758
00:45:06,399 --> 00:45:08,183
And I just--

759
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:12,144
I woke up a couple mornings
ago, and I said to myself,

760
00:45:12,231 --> 00:45:16,017
gosh darn it, I need some
excitement in my life.

761
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:36,950
Jeez.

762
00:45:50,878 --> 00:45:51,878

00:46:22,867 --> 00:46:24,259
Huh?

768
00:46:24,346 --> 00:46:25,043
MARY-ANNE: That's
where I'm headed.

769
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,609
For excitement.

770
00:46:26,696 --> 00:46:28,263
I guess I misunderstood.

771
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:35,357
I've never done
anything that before.

772
00:46:35,444 --> 00:46:36,444
Have you?

773
00:46:39,535 --> 00:46:40,536
When I was 17.

774
00:46:44,192 --> 00:46:48,588
Well, I won't leak
this, I promise.

775
00:46:48,675 --> 00:46:50,503
Probably best you don't.

776
00:46:54,942 --> 00:46:57,423
You know what I want?

777
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:01,644
I'd be guessing,
but a little cuddle.

778
00:47:01,731 --> 00:47:03,908
To be you.

779
00:47:03,995 --> 00:47:05,648
Just for a flash.

780
00:47:05,735 --> 00:47:08,521
Just to know what it feels like.

781
00:47:11,002 --> 00:47:12,481
You ever want what I have?

782
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:17,834
All the time.

Man, don't fill your
head with that shit.

00:49:51,162 --> 00:49:53,599
I think it's beautiful.

820
00:49:53,686 --> 00:49:54,904
It's useless.

you got is time.

take a bullet over there,

831
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,584
doesn't mean the mission's over.

Not open them up.

00:51:10,241 --> 00:51:11,546
We would have share days.

You want to take a
stroll down memory lane?

852
00:51:23,123 --> 00:51:24,403
We lit those
fucking vehicles up.

853
00:51:24,429 --> 00:51:25,734
We powed out of the back.

854
00:51:25,821 --> 00:51:27,388
I was there, I
know what happened.

855
00:51:27,475 --> 00:51:29,062
I don't care to be
thinking about this shit.

856
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,348
And I watched
that kid jump out

857
00:51:30,435 --> 00:51:34,003
of the forward Humvee, Will.

858
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,440
One big flame.

859
00:52:02,597 --> 00:52:06,210
He's flailing around,
screaming my name.

860
00:52:06,297 --> 00:52:09,169
And I looked at him.

861
00:52:09,256 --> 00:52:12,738
I did, I looked at
him, and I remember

862
00:52:12,825 --> 00:52:15,219
thinking, how messed
up, how disfigured he'd

863
00:52:15,306 --> 00:52:17,308
be if he shipped back home.

864
00:52:20,267 --> 00:52:25,925
And I was happy
that it wasn't me.

865
00:52:30,364 --> 00:52:32,410
I condemn myself
for that thought.

866
00:52:35,195 --> 00:52:37,110
There ain't no
compassion in that.

00:52:46,337 --> 00:52:47,337

00:52:54,432 --> 00:52:57,435
It's your turn, brother.

869
00:52:57,522 --> 00:53:00,394
You gotta talk.

870
00:53:00,481 --> 00:53:01,481
I don't.

871
00:53:23,156 --> 00:53:24,984
You sure about this?

872
00:53:25,071 --> 00:53:29,858
$200 seems like an awfully good
deal for this kind of watch.

873
00:53:29,945 --> 00:53:31,512
We're all set.

874
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,297
Well, if that's all
you'll take for it,

875
00:53:33,384 --> 00:53:35,473
I'm going to throw
in your drinks, too.

876
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,430
If you don't mind.

877
00:53:36,517 --> 00:53:37,605
Sure do appreciate it.

878
00:53:41,348 --> 00:53:42,393
Refill, please.

879
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,308
I'm going to take it to go.

880
00:53:44,395 --> 00:53:45,570
You got it.

881
00:53:55,188 --> 00:53:56,276

882
00:53:56,363 --> 00:53:57,363
A touch, thanks.

883
00:54:01,586 --> 00:54:03,022
Here you go.

884
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:07,331
And another round
for my friend, here.

885
00:54:07,418 --> 00:54:14,033
Well, I got him
covered, but here you are.

886
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,817
Compliments of the
young service member.

887
00:54:15,904 --> 00:54:17,689
Mighty nice of you, thank you.

888
00:54:17,776 --> 00:54:20,169
And I'll thank you in return.

889
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,083
How's that?

890
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:23,172
I see you there.

891
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,260
Army?

892
00:54:26,785 --> 00:54:30,441
Saw your memorial bracelet.

893
00:54:30,528 --> 00:54:31,355
Yeah, well.

894
00:54:31,442 --> 00:54:32,965
It was a body.

895
00:54:33,052 --> 00:54:34,445
Sorry to hear.

896
00:54:34,532 --> 00:54:35,881
Wearing that, you must miss him.

897
00:54:35,968 --> 00:54:38,013
Actually I can't
get rid of him.

898
00:54:45,325 --> 00:54:46,631
Thanks for serving, my friend.

899
00:54:52,332 --> 00:54:54,595
I was 1st battalion,
8th Marines.

900
00:54:54,682 --> 00:55:01,950
Got out after the
Beirut bombing, 1983.

901
00:55:02,037 --> 00:55:04,997
Islamic jihad took
241 Americans,

902
00:55:05,084 --> 00:55:06,999
but they didn't take me.

903
00:55:07,086 --> 00:55:09,741
Bad day.

904
00:55:09,828 --> 00:55:12,874
I was a younger man,
I'd still be fighting.

905
00:55:12,961 --> 00:55:14,006
To the warriors.

906
00:55:14,093 --> 00:55:15,093
Warriors.

907
00:55:23,102 --> 00:55:23,929
Sherry.

908
00:55:24,016 --> 00:55:25,016
Larry.

909
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:32,894
You ready young lady?

910
00:55:32,981 --> 00:55:33,981
Duh.

911
00:55:36,985 --> 00:55:37,985
Here you go.

912
00:55:50,216 --> 00:55:51,304
Who is she talking to?

913
00:55:53,959 --> 00:55:55,569
Your guess is as good as mine.

914
00:55:59,443 --> 00:56:00,443
You ready for this?

915
00:56:04,709 --> 00:56:10,236
She broke my 16-year-old
heart, she did.

916
00:56:10,323 --> 00:56:11,411
Can you believe it?

917
00:56:11,498 --> 00:56:13,457
I would.

918
00:56:13,544 --> 00:56:14,849
Boy oh boy.

919
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:18,766
I could tell you some stories.

920
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:23,597
She was my first love.

921
00:56:23,684 --> 00:56:26,687
I took her to the
high school prom.

922
00:56:26,774 --> 00:56:32,040
She was a hell of
a looker back then.

923
00:56:32,127 --> 00:56:33,127
Is that so?

924
00:56:35,609 --> 00:56:37,698
Yeah, but then she let
the guys get all over her,

925
00:56:37,785 --> 00:56:40,658
and that done changed her.

926
00:56:40,745 --> 00:56:44,488
She ain't the girl she used
to be, that's for sure.

927
00:56:44,575 --> 00:56:46,968
You took her to your prom?

928
00:56:47,055 --> 00:56:48,055
I did.

929
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:55,281
In a big old shiny limousine.

930
00:56:55,368 --> 00:56:57,239
Can she dance?

931
00:56:57,326 --> 00:56:59,503
Ah, let me think about that.

932
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:01,505
I believe so.

933
00:57:01,592 --> 00:57:04,290
Why don't I turn up the music,
and you could get on out there

934
00:57:04,377 --> 00:57:06,945
and see what she's got.

935
00:57:11,689 --> 00:57:14,169
All right.

936
00:57:14,256 --> 00:57:15,867
Friend?

937
00:57:15,954 --> 00:57:18,652
She's just an old
bird, looking for more.

938
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:20,524
Doesn't know how to
go about getting it.

939
00:57:20,611 --> 00:57:21,960
You with me?

940
00:57:22,047 --> 00:57:23,047
I gotcha.

941
00:57:32,057 --> 00:57:33,057
Young lady?

942
00:57:35,408 --> 00:57:37,497
Never seen you before.

943
00:57:37,584 --> 00:57:39,325
The fuck is that?

944
00:57:39,412 --> 00:57:40,805
It's my hand.

945
00:57:40,892 --> 00:57:42,043
Well I know it's
your hand, dummy.

946
00:57:42,067 --> 00:57:43,416
That's--

947
00:57:43,503 --> 00:57:46,985
Well, it's an invitation.

948
00:57:47,072 --> 00:57:50,292
Invitation?

949
00:57:50,379 --> 00:57:52,164
Where are you going to take me?

950
00:57:52,251 --> 00:57:55,515
Well, I was going to take
you out to the dance floor.

951
00:57:55,602 --> 00:57:57,909
Where I really
want to go is France.

952
00:57:57,996 --> 00:57:58,692
France?

953
00:57:58,779 --> 00:58:00,433
France, mm-hmm.

954
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,567
Well, that could be tough.

955
00:58:03,654 --> 00:58:05,612
You for real want to dance?

956
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:10,269
I'll bet you could teach
me a couple of things.

957
00:58:10,356 --> 00:58:14,578
I am a little bit older.

958
00:58:14,665 --> 00:58:17,276
I shit, I'm not much
of a mover anymore.

959
00:58:17,363 --> 00:58:20,497
You know back in the day I could
have showed you a real mean

960
00:58:20,584 --> 00:58:23,369
Cotton Eye Joe.

961
00:58:23,456 --> 00:58:26,328
Don't make me beg, now.

962
00:58:26,415 --> 00:58:27,415
All right.

963
00:58:32,378 --> 00:58:36,469
Let's see if I remember
how the fuck to do this.

964
00:58:36,556 --> 00:58:37,556
Whoop, got you.

965
00:58:40,125 --> 00:58:41,648
All right.

966
00:58:41,735 --> 00:58:43,408
WILL: You may want to
hold onto my shoulders,

967
00:58:43,432 --> 00:58:45,783
and just shake your hips
and walk around real slow,

968
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:46,870
ain't much to it.

969
00:58:46,914 --> 00:58:47,785
That's all got to do?

970
00:58:47,872 --> 00:58:49,700
All you got to do.

971
00:58:49,787 --> 00:58:51,136
I can do that.

972
00:58:51,223 --> 00:58:52,093
Hey, Larry?

973
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:54,400
Don't get jealous, now.

974
00:58:54,487 --> 00:58:56,837
I can cut in whenever
you're ready, darling.

975
00:59:10,024 --> 00:59:11,809
JUKEBOX: [SINGING]
I feel so bad.

976
00:59:11,896 --> 00:59:15,856
I got a worried mind.

977
00:59:15,943 --> 00:59:19,817
I'm so lonesome all the time.

978
00:59:19,904 --> 00:59:21,993
Something like this?

979
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,864
Something like that.

980
00:59:23,951 --> 00:59:26,071
JUKEBOX: [SINGING] Leave my
baby behind on Blue Bayou.

981
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:41,665
Save a nickle, save a dime,
work until the sun don't shine.

982
00:59:41,752 --> 00:59:46,278
Looking forward to happy
time on Blue Bayou.

983
00:59:50,021 --> 00:59:57,028
I'm going back some day,
come what may, to Blue Bayou.

984
01:00:00,509 --> 01:00:01,509
Where the--

985
01:00:12,783 --> 01:00:16,613
[SINGING] Bum, bum,
budum bum, bum bum.

986
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:19,224
I wouldn't do that.

987
01:00:19,311 --> 01:00:20,965
You're shit faced.

988
01:00:21,052 --> 01:00:23,837
Oh, you are underestimating
me, First Sergeant.

989
01:00:23,924 --> 01:00:26,492
I am sober.

990
01:00:29,103 --> 01:00:32,063
Oh get on over here, you old
see through son of a bitch.

991
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:33,412
I gotta tell you something.

992
01:00:33,499 --> 01:00:35,240
OK, tell me.

993
01:00:35,327 --> 01:00:36,870
All right, but you gotta
promise you won't take it

994
01:00:36,894 --> 01:00:37,590
the wrong way.

995
01:00:37,677 --> 01:00:38,417
I promise.

996
01:00:38,504 --> 01:00:39,374
Scout's honor.

997
01:00:39,461 --> 01:00:40,114
I'm going to tell you.

998
01:00:40,201 --> 01:00:41,507
Tell me.

999
01:00:41,594 --> 01:00:43,465
You are sexy as
shit for a dead guy.

1000
01:00:43,552 --> 01:00:45,163
Get out of here.

1001
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:46,880
That shit ain't worked for
me since I crossed over,

1002
01:00:46,904 --> 01:00:49,950
but I gave you a heads
up on it, though.

1003
01:00:50,037 --> 01:00:51,822
You're so lucky, man.

1004
01:00:51,909 --> 01:00:54,041
Why am I lucky, Ghost?

1005
01:00:54,128 --> 01:00:58,263
Because for you, it ain't
about fucking anymore, is it?

1006
01:00:58,350 --> 01:00:59,786
Who told you that?

1007
01:00:59,873 --> 01:01:01,111
It's obvious, dead
dudes don't fuck.

1008
01:01:01,135 --> 01:01:02,441
Where'd you hear that from?

1009
01:01:02,528 --> 01:01:04,965
I researched it.

1010
01:01:05,052 --> 01:01:07,664
But it ain't about fucking
at all, is it really?

1011
01:01:07,751 --> 01:01:09,100
Here, there?

1012
01:01:09,187 --> 01:01:10,338
I mean what we
need to be doing is

1013
01:01:10,362 --> 01:01:11,885
teaching people what you know.

1014
01:01:11,972 --> 01:01:12,973
I wouldn't argue on that.

1015
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:14,496
I wouldn't recommend it.

1016
01:01:14,583 --> 01:01:16,890
Look, people gotta
learn how to love, man.

1017
01:01:16,977 --> 01:01:18,805
Who are you it's?

1018
01:01:18,892 --> 01:01:21,460
It's what's in here, not
here, that's what it's about.

1019
01:01:21,547 --> 01:01:22,547
And you know what?

1020
01:01:22,591 --> 01:01:23,114
Where's my friend?

1021
01:01:23,201 --> 01:01:23,897
Huh?

1022
01:01:23,984 --> 01:01:24,898
Where is Ghost?

1023
01:01:24,985 --> 01:01:25,551
I want to find Ghost.

1024
01:01:25,638 --> 01:01:27,422
Look.

1025
01:01:27,509 --> 01:01:29,511
You probably spend
about 20 of your 30

1026
01:01:29,598 --> 01:01:32,776
some odd years here
on earth and about 90%

1027
01:01:32,863 --> 01:01:36,431
of those 20 years
looking for poontang.

1028
01:01:36,518 --> 01:01:37,041
Yeah.

1029
01:01:37,128 --> 01:01:38,782
Why?

1030
01:01:38,869 --> 01:01:41,262
Exactly.

1031
01:01:41,349 --> 01:01:44,962
Now, I'm a bit of a philosopher.

1032
01:01:45,049 --> 01:01:46,790
I think a little
outside the box.

1033
01:01:46,877 --> 01:01:48,530
Just a little bit?

1034
01:01:48,617 --> 01:01:51,490
It occurred to me, since
dead dudes don't fuck,

1035
01:01:51,577 --> 01:01:55,059
then clearly poontang is not of
importance in your dimensions.

1036
01:01:55,146 --> 01:01:57,801
Why do we think we need
it so bad here, man?

1037
01:01:57,888 --> 01:02:00,281
I mean break it down,
its primary function

1038
01:02:00,368 --> 01:02:03,067
is to provide by a porthole
from one side to the.

1039
01:02:03,154 --> 01:02:06,505
An entryway, if you will.

1040
01:02:06,592 --> 01:02:08,246
With hair on.

1041
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:10,814
Soft type, but you know
that's how I like it, Buddy.

1042
01:02:10,901 --> 01:02:12,511
I like a big old bush.

1043
01:02:12,598 --> 01:02:14,600
You like it so much
it's on your fucking face.

1044
01:02:14,687 --> 01:02:15,949
I get lost in it.

1045
01:02:16,036 --> 01:02:17,342
I need to know
the point, Ghost.

1046
01:02:17,429 --> 01:02:18,429
What's the point?

1047
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,739
Hold up.

1048
01:02:22,826 --> 01:02:25,002
Am I following you, 'cause I--

1049
01:02:25,089 --> 01:02:27,047
I thought it was you.

1050
01:02:27,134 --> 01:02:28,483
Oh, man, I was following you.

1051
01:02:35,795 --> 01:02:36,795
Let me see that.

1052
01:02:40,234 --> 01:02:41,453
Left foot, right foot.

1053
01:02:43,934 --> 01:02:44,934
Oh.

1054
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:50,809
All right.

1055
01:03:10,003 --> 01:03:11,744
Sammy, I made a
decision that I'm going

1056
01:03:11,831 --> 01:03:14,703
to regret the rest of my life.

1057
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:15,791
What's that?

1058
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:25,062
I put my best friend in the
enemy's skull, and I lost him.

1059
01:03:25,149 --> 01:03:27,412
I made the decision on my
own to break cover, Will.

1060
01:03:30,676 --> 01:03:32,156
I was careless.

1061
01:03:40,947 --> 01:03:41,992
Look at me.

1062
01:03:46,735 --> 01:03:49,913
You were brave.

1063
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,786
You trusted me.

1064
01:03:53,873 --> 01:03:56,484
I'd take a bullet
to bring you back.

1065
01:04:01,968 --> 01:04:04,405
What do I--

1066
01:04:08,932 --> 01:04:10,411
Oh, what do I do?

1067
01:04:10,498 --> 01:04:11,498
Fuck.

1068
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:59,721
It's perfect, thank you.

1069
01:04:59,808 --> 01:05:01,723
Just use the bed right there.

1070
01:05:09,122 --> 01:05:12,038
Here you go.

1071
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:13,257
It's a beautiful day.

1072
01:05:36,628 --> 01:05:39,109
[pop, pop]

1073
01:06:04,134 --> 01:06:04,743
[pop]

1074
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:05,830
Will?

1075
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:09,965
William?

1076
01:06:21,934 --> 01:06:22,934
Is that you?

1077
01:06:33,685 --> 01:06:35,426
Looks like you're
a pretty good shot.

1078
01:06:38,429 --> 01:06:40,605
I think I may know
where you get that from.

1079
01:06:44,174 --> 01:06:45,174
You know who I am?

1080
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:50,571
Yes, sir.

1081
01:06:50,658 --> 01:06:52,791
WILL: You sure?

1082
01:06:52,878 --> 01:06:53,878
Yes, sir.

1083
01:06:59,885 --> 01:07:02,801
Can I approach you?

1084
01:07:02,888 --> 01:07:05,195
Yes sir.

1085
01:07:05,282 --> 01:07:06,370
It's all right, buddy.

1086
01:07:13,507 --> 01:07:17,468
I brought you this
monster truck.

1087
01:07:17,555 --> 01:07:20,819
I don't know if you're
into these things,

1088
01:07:20,906 --> 01:07:26,520
but it seemed kind of cool.

1089
01:07:29,915 --> 01:07:30,915
I like it.

1090
01:07:33,005 --> 01:07:38,532
Boy, it's been so long
I hardly recognize you.

1091
01:07:41,187 --> 01:07:42,187
Yes, sir.

1092
01:07:45,017 --> 01:07:46,017
You got big.

1093
01:07:49,021 --> 01:07:53,373
My momma told me that you
got sick during the war.

1094
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:56,724
She said you had to go away.

1095
01:07:56,811 --> 01:07:59,945
Your momma said that?

1096
01:08:00,032 --> 01:08:01,164
Is it true?

1097
01:08:01,251 --> 01:08:04,167
WILL: Yeah, it is.

1098
01:08:04,254 --> 01:08:06,169
Did you get injured?

1099
01:08:06,256 --> 01:08:07,344
I did.

1100
01:08:07,431 --> 01:08:08,431
What happened?

1101
01:08:10,738 --> 01:08:15,352
I got caught a
couple of explosions.

1102
01:08:15,439 --> 01:08:18,181
They injured my brain.

1103
01:08:18,268 --> 01:08:21,140
They call it TBI.

1104
01:08:21,227 --> 01:08:23,577
What's TBI?

1105
01:08:23,664 --> 01:08:27,712
WILL: Traumatic brain injury.

1106
01:08:27,799 --> 01:08:32,325
And I-- I lost a
friend over there, too,

1107
01:08:32,412 --> 01:08:33,674
and that hurt me pretty bad.

1108
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:37,939
I lost a lot, actually.

1109
01:08:38,026 --> 01:08:42,988
I lost your momma, I lost you.

1110
01:08:43,075 --> 01:08:44,075
Are you better now?

1111
01:08:48,167 --> 01:08:51,649
Son, right this
second I sure am.

1112
01:09:24,856 --> 01:09:26,597
William!

1113
01:09:26,684 --> 01:09:27,946
Get away from my son.

1114
01:09:42,047 --> 01:09:43,047
Kimmie?

1115
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,253
What's wrong?

1116
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:16,995
Don't be alarmed.

1117
01:10:17,082 --> 01:10:18,649
What?

1118
01:10:18,736 --> 01:10:21,086
William's father
showed up here today.

1119
01:10:24,132 --> 01:10:25,132
And?

1120
01:10:28,093 --> 01:10:29,093
Jesus.

1121
01:10:42,063 --> 01:10:44,022
I told him that I needed
to speak to you first,

1122
01:10:44,109 --> 01:10:49,332
that it wasn't an appropriate
time to visit, but he insisted.

1123
01:10:49,419 --> 01:10:51,508
I'm sorry, Buddy.

1124
01:10:51,595 --> 01:10:53,292
I had to put dinner
on, he's still here.

1125
01:10:53,379 --> 01:10:54,250
Where is he?

1126
01:10:54,337 --> 01:10:55,381
He's here right now?

1127
01:10:55,468 --> 01:10:56,339
Where?

1128
01:10:56,426 --> 01:10:57,818
He want to see William.

1129
01:10:57,905 --> 01:10:59,603
And that's a
decision he made when?

1130
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:01,605
He's in Will's room.

1131
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:06,827
I couldn't refuse him.

1132
01:11:06,914 --> 01:11:09,656
Well, he just going
to have to leave.

1133
01:11:09,743 --> 01:11:10,570
No.

1134
01:11:10,657 --> 01:11:11,179
It's that simple.

1135
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:11,832
No.

1136
01:11:11,919 --> 01:11:14,052
Just--

1137
01:11:14,139 --> 01:11:15,358
All right, I'll leave.

1138
01:11:15,445 --> 01:11:16,489
No, stay, God dammit.

1139
01:11:16,576 --> 01:11:17,664
Please don't do this to me.

1140
01:11:25,368 --> 01:11:27,935
Shit.

1141
01:11:28,022 --> 01:11:33,550
This is called
a wedge formation.

1142
01:11:33,637 --> 01:11:35,552
Why do they use it?

1143
01:11:35,639 --> 01:11:38,946
Well, you got all your
firepower here at the front,

1144
01:11:39,033 --> 01:11:43,255
and see your flanks this
whole sector is covered.

1145
01:11:43,342 --> 01:11:45,344
Are you out of the Army now?

1146
01:11:45,431 --> 01:11:46,431
Yeah.

1147
01:11:48,652 --> 01:11:50,915
Do you miss it?

1148
01:11:51,002 --> 01:11:52,351
Every day.

1149
01:11:52,438 --> 01:11:54,397
Why don't you go back?

1150
01:11:54,484 --> 01:11:57,748
Because I got things
to do here, now.

1151
01:11:57,835 --> 01:12:01,404
Were you a ground pounder?

1152
01:12:01,491 --> 01:12:03,362
You know about
ground pounders?

1153
01:12:03,449 --> 01:12:05,538
My friend's brother
is in the Air Force.

1154
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:08,324
That's what he calls army guys.

1155
01:12:08,411 --> 01:12:10,587
I want to be in the military.

1156
01:12:10,674 --> 01:12:14,808
Little man, I fought
so you wouldn't have to.

1157
01:12:14,895 --> 01:12:17,594
I just don't think I
can handle civilian life.

1158
01:12:17,681 --> 01:12:20,510
What makes you think you
can handle military life?

1159
01:12:20,597 --> 01:12:21,946
What makes you think I can't?

1160
01:12:24,688 --> 01:12:26,472
You love your country?

1161
01:12:26,559 --> 01:12:27,952
Yes, sir.

1162
01:12:28,039 --> 01:12:31,999
Well, that's the
only requirement.

1163
01:12:32,086 --> 01:12:35,046
I think the army would
be happy to have you.

1164
01:12:35,133 --> 01:12:36,308
The Navy.

1165
01:12:36,395 --> 01:12:37,570
The what?

1166
01:12:37,657 --> 01:12:39,442
I want to be a Seal.

1167
01:12:39,529 --> 01:12:40,965
A Seal?

1168
01:12:41,052 --> 01:12:43,446
What, about like
Delta or something?

1169
01:12:43,533 --> 01:12:44,795
No, a Seal.

1170
01:12:47,101 --> 01:12:49,234
Let's say we'll
talk about that later.

1171
01:13:08,862 --> 01:13:11,082
KIMMIE: Will has his player
evaluations coming up

1172
01:13:11,169 --> 01:13:12,213
for the new season.

1173
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:13,954
It's an exciting afternoon.

1174
01:13:14,041 --> 01:13:18,306
There's barbecuing and
games for the kids, music.

1175
01:13:21,658 --> 01:13:24,791
Be nice if you could come, Will.

1176
01:13:24,878 --> 01:13:26,271
WILL: When is that?

1177
01:13:28,969 --> 01:13:31,407
KIMMIE: Its next
week, I have to--

1178
01:13:31,494 --> 01:13:32,494
I'd have to look.

1179
01:13:40,024 --> 01:13:41,591
So what are your plans, Will?

1180
01:13:44,507 --> 01:13:46,291
I'm not sure.

1181
01:13:46,378 --> 01:13:47,378
So you're missing work?

1182
01:13:50,121 --> 01:13:51,905
I don't really
have a set schedule.

1183
01:13:51,992 --> 01:13:53,864
Buddy.

1184
01:13:53,951 --> 01:13:55,474
Mom, can I have more pasta?

1185
01:13:55,561 --> 01:13:57,607
Yeah, of course.

1186
01:13:57,694 --> 01:13:59,347
I'm glad you like it.

1187
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:00,479
California, right?

1188
01:14:00,566 --> 01:14:02,655
You said that's where you live.

1189
01:14:02,742 --> 01:14:04,527
Correct.

1190
01:14:04,614 --> 01:14:06,113
BUDDY: So what are you doing
in Cali that you can just

1191
01:14:06,137 --> 01:14:07,878
pick up and go?

1192
01:14:07,965 --> 01:14:09,401
Bud, you want
an extra helping?

1193
01:14:09,488 --> 01:14:10,533
No, thank you, sweetheart.

1194
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:12,056
I'm fine, thanks.

1195
01:14:12,143 --> 01:14:13,536
Will?

1196
01:14:13,623 --> 01:14:15,059
No, thank you.

1197
01:14:18,366 --> 01:14:20,891
I'm a painter.

1198
01:14:20,978 --> 01:14:22,240
So am I.

1199
01:14:22,327 --> 01:14:23,371
You paint?

1200
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:24,198
I do.

1201
01:14:24,285 --> 01:14:24,982
WILL: Come on.

1202
01:14:25,069 --> 01:14:25,896
That's awesome.

1203
01:14:25,983 --> 01:14:27,375
[laughing]

1204
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:28,657
KIMMIE: That's wonderful, Will.

1205
01:14:28,681 --> 01:14:31,379
That's surprising.

1206
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:32,859
WILL: Really?

1207
01:14:32,946 --> 01:14:34,034
Does your work sell?

1208
01:14:37,647 --> 01:14:39,475
It's public.

1209
01:14:39,562 --> 01:14:40,562
Site specific?

1210
01:14:45,393 --> 01:14:48,266
Sure would love to see your
portfolio sometime, Will.

1211
01:14:51,008 --> 01:14:55,447
One would think that us country
folk out here don't appreciate

1212
01:14:55,534 --> 01:14:59,407
the fine arts, but I assure
you, that is just not the case.

1213
01:15:02,846 --> 01:15:06,502
What is it, exactly,
that you country folk

1214
01:15:06,589 --> 01:15:08,460
appreciate about it?

1215
01:15:08,547 --> 01:15:11,115
Mom, may I be excused to go
finish setting up my soldiers?

1216
01:15:11,202 --> 01:15:14,118
That's fine, but you need
to ask somebody else, too.

1217
01:15:14,205 --> 01:15:15,249
Dad?

1218
01:15:15,336 --> 01:15:16,336
BOTH: Yeah.

1219
01:15:31,396 --> 01:15:32,658
Goodbye.

1220
01:15:32,745 --> 01:15:35,618
Bye.

1221
01:15:35,705 --> 01:15:37,968
Thank you.

1222
01:15:38,055 --> 01:15:40,187
KIMMIE: I apologize, I know
that was uncomfortable.

1223
01:15:40,274 --> 01:15:42,538
It was all just so
sudden, that's all.

1224
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:44,322
Hey, I'm happy for you.

1225
01:15:47,368 --> 01:15:50,458
He's a good man.

1226
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:51,895
It's what you always wanted.

1227
01:15:54,419 --> 01:15:57,770
Nice to finally meet you.

1228
01:15:57,857 --> 01:15:59,467
Thank you for
your hospitality.

1229
01:16:03,254 --> 01:16:08,520
So you came here
for your son, right?

1230
01:16:08,607 --> 01:16:11,784
Put me at ease, right now.

1231
01:16:11,871 --> 01:16:12,871
At ease.

They are weary of trooping
with the whimpering dead.

1235
01:16:49,213 --> 01:16:54,087
God's laughing in heaven

must own that I shall miss you

Hello, invisible man.

1243
01:17:31,821 --> 01:17:33,344
I knew that was you.

1244
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:37,827
Come on up.

1245
01:17:49,621 --> 01:17:52,755
You need to be alone?

Tell me.

BUDDY: We don't talk
about him so much, hon.

1249
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:11,164
He's not at all what I expected.

1250
01:18:13,993 --> 01:18:15,038
Which was?

1251
01:18:19,738 --> 01:18:20,738
I don't know.

You still love him.

1254

Why would you ask that?

1255
01:18:35,972 --> 01:18:37,495
It's not a question.

1256
01:18:41,542 --> 01:18:42,542
I love you.

1257
01:18:53,859 --> 01:18:55,165

01:20:40,531 --> 01:20:42,838
I hit a homer
first time at bat.

1286
01:20:42,925 --> 01:20:44,317
Oh.

1287
01:20:44,404 --> 01:20:46,015
My brother, you disappoint me.

1288
01:20:46,102 --> 01:20:48,495
What happened to it's in here.

1289
01:20:48,582 --> 01:20:49,322
I know.

1290
01:20:49,409 --> 01:20:50,671
Not in here.

1291
01:20:50,758 --> 01:20:51,759
I know.

1292
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:53,457
You're working backwards.

1293
01:20:53,544 --> 01:20:54,937
Apparently.

1294
01:20:55,024 --> 01:20:56,939
Hold off on introducing
yourself to her.

1295
01:20:57,026 --> 01:21:00,377
You don't want to
freak the girl out.

1296
01:21:00,464 --> 01:21:02,074
Met this guy.

1297
01:21:02,161 --> 01:21:02,945
No shit.

1298
01:21:03,032 --> 01:21:05,121
And?

1299
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:06,557
MARY-ANNE [ON PHONE]: And, I--

1300
01:21:06,644 --> 01:21:07,906
You what?

1301
01:21:07,993 --> 01:21:09,952
I want to take
him home with me.

1302
01:21:10,039 --> 01:21:11,039
Yeah!

1303
01:21:13,042 --> 01:21:14,739
What was that?

1304
01:21:14,826 --> 01:21:15,958
That's fantastic.

1305
01:21:16,045 --> 01:21:17,089
So tell me about him.

1306
01:21:21,006 --> 01:21:22,747
Well.

1307
01:21:22,834 --> 01:21:26,403
So this is the master
plan, but it's all good.

1308
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:28,579
You feel it?

1309
01:21:28,666 --> 01:21:30,320
Feels right.

1310
01:21:30,407 --> 01:21:32,365
This last phase of your
life, where you landed,

1311
01:21:32,452 --> 01:21:34,585
it was just supposed
to be a layover.

1312
01:21:34,672 --> 01:21:37,109
You just missed your connecting
flight, but you know what?

1313
01:21:37,196 --> 01:21:39,242
Someone up there must
like you, because there's

1314
01:21:39,329 --> 01:21:40,808
another one boarding right now.

1315
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:44,073
And if you run, you
might just catch it.

1316
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:46,249
Will my baggage make it?

1317
01:21:46,336 --> 01:21:47,511
Let's hope the hell not.

1318
01:21:53,604 --> 01:22:02,526
You know, man, 11 years ago
my wife delivered by c-section.

1319
01:22:02,613 --> 01:22:05,833
The doctor reached into
the hole in her stomach,

1320
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:09,446
and with blue rubber gloved
hand pulls out my son,

1321
01:22:09,533 --> 01:22:12,362
and holds him under
this white operating

1322
01:22:12,449 --> 01:22:18,890
light, long waxy umbilical
cord dangling below.

1323
01:22:18,977 --> 01:22:21,675
And I have forgotten
everything prior

1324
01:22:21,762 --> 01:22:25,549
to that moment, 'cause
the experience of meeting

1325
01:22:25,636 --> 01:22:28,726
my son for the first time
trumped everything in my life.

1326
01:22:33,818 --> 01:22:40,346
And then I walked away, put
on my gear, went to war.

1327
01:22:40,433 --> 01:22:42,174
And boy, I thought I
was going to come back

1328
01:22:42,261 --> 01:22:46,396
with stories to tell him
about how brave I was, how I

1329
01:22:46,483 --> 01:22:49,225
put myself in the line of fire.

1330
01:22:49,312 --> 01:22:52,663
In harm's way for our
country, his future.

1331
01:22:55,013 --> 01:22:57,885
Now the fighting is over, but
it's like I never came home,

1332
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,583
because it's all I think about.

1333
01:23:02,412 --> 01:23:04,414
I've been this guy trying
to survive his own war

1334
01:23:04,501 --> 01:23:06,242
stories for so
long, I can't hardly

1335
01:23:06,329 --> 01:23:09,332
remember who I'm
really supposed to be.

1336
01:23:09,419 --> 01:23:13,075
It'll come back to you.

1337
01:23:13,162 --> 01:23:14,162
Just give it time.

1338
01:23:18,167 --> 01:23:20,908
Hope so.

1339
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:21,996
Know so.

1340
01:23:25,348 --> 01:23:27,089
EMILY [ON PHONE]: Different how?

1341
01:23:27,176 --> 01:23:31,528
Well he's kind of
rough around the edges.

1342
01:23:31,615 --> 01:23:35,619
EMILY [ON PHONE]: Well, that
can be a good thing, sometimes.

1343
01:23:35,706 --> 01:23:37,316
Yeah, I just--

1344
01:23:37,403 --> 01:23:41,233
I hope he doesn't think
I'm one of his groupies.

1345
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,366
Whoa, stop right there.

1346
01:23:43,453 --> 01:23:44,715
No, I'm hanging up.

1347
01:23:44,802 --> 01:23:45,672
I'm hanging up.

1348
01:23:45,759 --> 01:23:46,456
Hanging up.

1349
01:23:46,543 --> 01:23:47,196
Hanging up.

1350
01:23:47,283 --> 01:23:48,283
No, wait.

1351
01:23:50,677 --> 01:23:52,201
What?

1352
01:23:52,288 --> 01:23:53,848
Mary-Anne, are you
sleeping with Bryan--

1353
01:23:56,205 --> 01:23:57,815
WILL: It's the adrenaline.

1354
01:23:57,902 --> 01:24:01,210
Not having it one
day you're running,

1355
01:24:01,297 --> 01:24:03,081
you're gunning,
next your standing

1356
01:24:03,168 --> 01:24:05,997
on a street corner in your
hometown, nothing but time.

1357
01:24:06,084 --> 01:24:08,130
To remember.

1358
01:24:08,217 --> 01:24:10,915
I had a purpose over there.

1359
01:24:11,002 --> 01:24:13,135
You got one here, too.

1360
01:24:13,222 --> 01:24:15,963
You know, once you sort through
all this shit and own it,

1361
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:17,574
is gold, baby.

1362
01:24:17,661 --> 01:24:19,924
There's hundreds of
thousands of veterans

1363
01:24:20,011 --> 01:24:22,492
out there, just like you Ghost.

1364
01:24:22,579 --> 01:24:24,146
You can help them, they need it.

1365
01:24:24,233 --> 01:24:25,973
That's your purpose,
and you mean it.

1366
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:27,540
OK?

1367
01:24:27,627 --> 01:24:29,455
But you have to be a survivor.

1368
01:24:29,542 --> 01:24:31,979
You've got to have the answers,
Ghost, or they won't listen.

1369
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:32,980
I understand.

1370
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:34,417
Love to help.

1371
01:24:34,504 --> 01:24:35,611
Well, that's
your purpose, here.

1372
01:24:35,635 --> 01:24:36,723
I mean it.

1373
01:24:36,810 --> 01:24:37,810
I suppose.

1374
01:24:41,989 --> 01:24:44,035
You know, I have been
thinking about what you

1375
01:24:44,122 --> 01:24:45,645
were saying about me modeling.

1376
01:24:45,732 --> 01:24:47,386
So you just want to be rich.

1377
01:24:47,473 --> 01:24:49,127
Well, wouldn't you?

1378
01:24:49,214 --> 01:24:50,085
Oh, yo.

1379
01:24:50,172 --> 01:24:51,999
I wrote a new song.

1380
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:53,325
Another thing I want to talk
to you about is the lotto.

1381
01:24:53,349 --> 01:24:55,002
But that's illegal.

1382
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:56,154
To get the winning
numbers from the other side?

1383
01:24:56,178 --> 01:24:57,242
I just can't give them to you.

1384
01:24:57,266 --> 01:24:57,744
Do you know them?

1385
01:24:57,831 --> 01:24:58,397
.

1386
01:24:58,484 --> 01:24:59,398
Maybe

1387
01:24:59,485 --> 01:25:00,965
Well who's going to--

1388
01:25:01,052 --> 01:25:05,143
You want to hear
the new song, or what?

1389
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:06,927
OK.

1390
01:25:07,014 --> 01:25:08,190
I don't have my guitar.

1391
01:25:08,277 --> 01:25:10,061
I got you.

1392
01:25:10,148 --> 01:25:12,977
All right.

1393
01:25:13,064 --> 01:25:15,458
[humming]

1394
01:25:16,894 --> 01:25:18,243
You follow?

1395
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:20,985
Clear as a bell.

1396
01:25:21,072 --> 01:25:29,124
[SINGING] When the night's too
dark, and the day's too cold,

1397
01:25:29,211 --> 01:25:37,219
and you can't find a single
thing to rest your weary soul,

1398
01:25:37,306 --> 01:25:44,704
at the end of every tunnel,
there's a light to guide you

1399
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:50,362
home, and you don't
have to worry,

1400
01:25:50,449 --> 01:25:52,843
'cause you'll never be alone.

1401
01:25:55,411 --> 01:26:02,635
I will always be there for you.

1402
01:26:02,722 --> 01:26:08,250
Said I will always
be there for you.

1403
01:26:08,337 --> 01:26:10,121
Hey, Dad.

1404
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:14,517
SAMUEL: [SIGNING] No matter
what you're going through.

1405
01:26:14,604 --> 01:26:17,128
Let's see what you got.

1406
01:26:17,215 --> 01:26:19,086
Let's see what you got.

1407
01:26:21,959 --> 01:26:28,966
SAMUEL: [SINGING] I will
always be there for you.

1408
01:26:44,547 --> 01:26:48,246
Mom, I'm going to
go play on Dad's bike.

1409
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:49,813
OK, we're coming.

1410
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:50,900
Watch me, though.

1411
01:26:55,471 --> 01:26:58,125
Hard to believe.

1412
01:26:58,213 --> 01:26:59,213
Yeah.

1413
01:27:13,576 --> 01:27:14,751
I can't leave here.

1414
01:27:14,838 --> 01:27:15,838
I know that.

1415
01:27:18,711 --> 01:27:21,105
But if I could, I
would, I would follow you.

1416
01:27:23,716 --> 01:27:25,762
I've never seen him so happy.

1417
01:27:25,849 --> 01:27:29,505
I've never seen you this happy.

1418
01:27:29,592 --> 01:27:31,420
This is who I fell in love with.

1419
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,516
I watched the fighting on TV
from our living room, Will.

1420
01:27:40,603 --> 01:27:42,431
Babe, you don't have to.

1421
01:27:42,518 --> 01:27:44,278
And I was scared that you
were never going to come home,

1422
01:27:44,302 --> 01:27:47,523
and that I was going to be
a widow, that our son wasn't

1423
01:27:47,610 --> 01:27:48,654
going to have a father.

1424
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:53,267
I panicked.

1425
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:59,665
There was this woman who
moved down the street when you

1426
01:27:59,752 --> 01:28:02,102
were gone, her name was Arlene.

1427
01:28:02,189 --> 01:28:03,452
She was seven months pregnant.

1428
01:28:05,976 --> 01:28:07,978
I was putting William
in the car seat

1429
01:28:08,065 --> 01:28:11,068
when a gray army van pulled
up in front of her house.

1430
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:15,377
Those men weren't
even out the vehicle

1431
01:28:15,464 --> 01:28:18,510
before she started screaming.

1432
01:28:18,597 --> 01:28:25,343
I just ran to her, and I
left William in the car,

1433
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:27,737
I mean we didn't
even know each other,

1434
01:28:27,824 --> 01:28:31,001
but I held her in my
arms while they told her

1435
01:28:31,088 --> 01:28:33,743
that her husband had
been killed in action.

1436
01:28:40,227 --> 01:28:44,144
I just couldn't bear it.

1437
01:28:44,231 --> 01:28:45,755
I wasn't that strong.

1438
01:28:50,542 --> 01:28:52,022
And I was lonely.

1439
01:28:56,809 --> 01:29:00,030
And I'm still lonely.

1440
01:29:04,164 --> 01:29:08,125
And I am so damn happy
that you're alive.

1441
01:29:15,219 --> 01:29:19,092
Now, go be with your son.

1442
01:29:24,184 --> 01:29:25,664
I love you.

1443
01:30:14,104 --> 01:30:15,845
Hey.

1444
01:30:15,932 --> 01:30:18,587
God damn, this guy stinks.

1445
01:30:18,674 --> 01:30:20,153
Jesus Christ.

1446
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:20,980
Fuck, man.

1447
01:30:21,067 --> 01:30:21,807
Jesus.

1448
01:30:21,894 --> 01:30:23,853
Give me that.

1449
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:24,462
Hey!

1450
01:30:24,549 --> 01:30:25,549
Hey!

1451
01:30:36,953 --> 01:30:37,693
Come on.

1452
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:39,129
Get your bag.

1453
01:30:43,481 --> 01:30:45,352
Come on, come on, come on.

1454
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,658
[music playing]

1455
01:30:56,015 --> 01:30:57,015
Come on.

1456
01:31:00,193 --> 01:31:00,846
Get it, boy.

1457
01:31:00,933 --> 01:31:01,804
All right.

1458
01:31:01,891 --> 01:31:03,240
Just like that, bro.

1459
01:31:03,327 --> 01:31:05,068
You dance like a
fucking Weeble-Wobble.

1460
01:31:05,155 --> 01:31:07,549
Hey, now, you ain't gotta
understand how I do, yeah?

1461
01:31:07,636 --> 01:31:10,073
You definitely don't
understand how I do.

1462
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:11,160
Here.

1463
01:31:13,511 --> 01:31:14,511
Hey!

1464
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:18,603
I got the patent
on that shit, man.

1465
01:31:18,690 --> 01:31:20,866
I'm gonna call it
the one-legged jam.

1466
01:31:20,953 --> 01:31:22,259
Oh.

1467
01:31:22,346 --> 01:31:23,366
Hey, shit, what
are we drinking to?

1468
01:31:23,390 --> 01:31:25,044
What are we drinking?

1469
01:31:25,131 --> 01:31:26,045
Oh, shit.

1470
01:31:26,132 --> 01:31:27,394
No more, motherfucker.

1471
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:29,135
What do you mean,
no motherfucker?

1472
01:31:29,222 --> 01:31:30,136
I mean no more of the
fuckin' war, motherfucker.

1473
01:31:30,223 --> 01:31:30,833
I'm drunk.

1474
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:31,660
Oh.

1475
01:31:31,747 --> 01:31:32,748
I forgot.

1476
01:31:32,835 --> 01:31:35,272
She's a marine.

1477
01:31:35,359 --> 01:31:36,229
Let me tuck you in.

1478
01:31:36,316 --> 01:31:37,143
I'm tucked, I'm tucked.

1479
01:31:37,230 --> 01:31:38,580
You tucked?

1480
01:31:38,667 --> 01:31:39,905
Yeah, you are
tucked the fucking--

1481
01:31:39,929 --> 01:31:42,453
and you're drinking.

1482
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:43,759
Hold this shit.

1483
01:31:50,026 --> 01:31:53,246
Did you just pour a
fucking beer on my leg?

1484
01:31:53,333 --> 01:31:54,509
Hey, you got a name?

1485
01:31:54,596 --> 01:31:56,511
What do you go by?

1486
01:31:56,598 --> 01:31:57,947
McGill.

1487
01:31:58,034 --> 01:32:00,732
McGill Charles Burroughs, baby.

1488
01:32:00,819 --> 01:32:04,170
Lance Corporal
Charles Burroughs.

1489
01:32:04,257 --> 01:32:06,303
Just Charlie, though.

1490
01:32:06,390 --> 01:32:07,304
Just Charlie.

1491
01:32:07,391 --> 01:32:10,046
WILL: Charlie Burroughs.

1492
01:32:10,133 --> 01:32:11,917
Fuck.

1493
01:32:12,004 --> 01:32:13,025
You know why Marines have holes
in their forehead, Charlie

1494
01:32:13,049 --> 01:32:13,702
Burroughs?

1495
01:32:13,789 --> 01:32:14,485
Oh, shit.

1496
01:32:14,572 --> 01:32:16,182
Why is that?

1497
01:32:16,269 --> 01:32:17,183
Because they try teach
him how to eat with a fork

1498
01:32:17,270 --> 01:32:18,663
during basic training.

1499
01:32:18,750 --> 01:32:20,839
Look, I know that's an old
one, but it's a classic.

1500
01:32:20,926 --> 01:32:23,625
I couldn't fit my head
in a jar, so I went Army.

1501
01:32:23,712 --> 01:32:26,932
Oh, my daddy was Army, man.

1502
01:32:27,019 --> 01:32:31,850
Shit, he told me in the Marines
were the first to fight.

1503
01:32:31,937 --> 01:32:35,462
You know my daddy, man.

1504
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:38,422
My daddy died overseas.

1505
01:32:38,509 --> 01:32:41,077
Operation Iraqi Freedom.

1506
01:32:41,164 --> 01:32:42,164
IED.

1507
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:48,911
Transport his remains all the
way up Arlington National, man.

1508
01:32:48,998 --> 01:32:50,869
See, I ain't never been.

1509
01:32:50,956 --> 01:32:55,613
You know, I never even had a
chance to say goodbye, either.

1510
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:57,528
My mama wouldn't take me.

1511
01:32:57,615 --> 01:33:01,227
She says she wanted me to
remember his smiling face,

1512
01:33:01,314 --> 01:33:03,360
not his burial place.

1513
01:33:03,447 --> 01:33:04,666
How old was he?

1514
01:33:04,753 --> 01:33:06,145
38 years young.

1515
01:33:09,148 --> 01:33:10,802
Shit.

1516
01:33:10,889 --> 01:33:13,283
I enlisted right after
they put him on the ground.

1517
01:33:13,370 --> 01:33:17,809
Went to basic, out of
basic, straight to combat.

1518
01:33:17,896 --> 01:33:22,161
Made E3, then lost
my fucking leg.

1519
01:33:22,248 --> 01:33:23,902
Man, I shipped right back home.

1520
01:33:27,123 --> 01:33:30,561
I was a Marine for about a--

1521
01:33:30,648 --> 01:33:32,389
a minute.

1522
01:33:32,476 --> 01:33:33,584
Hey, you know they could
hook you up with a better

1523
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:34,759
piece than this old can opener.

1524
01:33:34,783 --> 01:33:36,175
Shit.

1525
01:33:36,262 --> 01:33:38,569
You know, it took
about a year just

1526
01:33:38,656 --> 01:33:40,527
to get into the system, brother.

1527
01:33:40,615 --> 01:33:45,576
And then after like two years,
I still hadn't gotten anything,

1528
01:33:45,663 --> 01:33:46,708
you know what I'm saying?

1529
01:33:46,795 --> 01:33:48,579
So I quit.

1530
01:33:48,666 --> 01:33:50,066
That's the temp leg
lag they gave me

1531
01:33:50,146 --> 01:33:52,278
when I first got stateside.

1532
01:33:57,588 --> 01:33:59,198
Look, man.

1533
01:33:59,285 --> 01:34:02,593
The military, man, they
gave my dad an education,

1534
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:05,465
put food on the table.

1535
01:34:05,552 --> 01:34:08,468
So I ain't going to talk
shit about the military.

1536
01:34:08,555 --> 01:34:14,344
But the VA, the VA's a
fucking shit show, man.

1537
01:34:14,431 --> 01:34:16,520
No lie.

1538
01:34:16,607 --> 01:34:18,783
[knocking]

1539
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:20,742
Uh-oh.

1540
01:34:20,829 --> 01:34:21,612
Shit.

1541
01:34:21,699 --> 01:34:22,265
Uh, OK.

1542
01:34:22,352 --> 01:34:23,440
Shit.

1543
01:34:23,527 --> 01:34:24,727
I'm gonna take a nap, brother.

1544
01:34:27,705 --> 01:34:28,575
Hey.

1545
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:29,359
Here for the party.

1546
01:34:29,446 --> 01:34:30,142
Come on in.

1547
01:34:30,229 --> 01:34:31,143
Get you a drink?

1548
01:34:31,230 --> 01:34:32,101
What's with the leg?

1549
01:34:32,188 --> 01:34:33,885
It's a bit of a story.

1550
01:34:33,972 --> 01:34:35,452
Who's that?

1551
01:34:35,539 --> 01:34:38,281
That's my new friend,
Charlie Burroughs.

1552
01:34:38,368 --> 01:34:39,674
Hi.

1553
01:34:39,761 --> 01:34:40,805
What's he doing in my bed?

1554
01:34:40,892 --> 01:34:42,111
He's a little drunk.

1555
01:34:42,198 --> 01:34:43,852
Correct.

1556
01:34:43,939 --> 01:34:45,854
Listen, he's a great kid.

1557
01:34:45,941 --> 01:34:48,595
He's homeless, I offered
to let him get cleaned up,

1558
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:51,424
but that never happened,
because we got into the tequila.

1559
01:34:51,511 --> 01:34:53,339
And then he taught
me a couple dance

1560
01:34:53,426 --> 01:34:56,647
moves that I'd like to show you
later, and the rest is history.

1561
01:34:56,734 --> 01:34:59,215
I want him out of my bed.

1562
01:34:59,302 --> 01:35:01,434
Right now.

1563
01:35:01,521 --> 01:35:03,262
Out, out!

1564
01:35:03,349 --> 01:35:04,829
Come on.

1565
01:35:04,916 --> 01:35:05,787
Hey.

1566
01:35:05,874 --> 01:35:07,658
I'm sorry, man.

1567
01:35:07,745 --> 01:35:10,356
It's cool, it's cool.

1568
01:35:10,443 --> 01:35:11,443
I get it.

1569
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:15,057
Yes.

1570
01:35:15,144 --> 01:35:16,972
Hi.

1571
01:35:17,059 --> 01:35:20,410
Can you send someone up to
change the sheets in my room?

1572
01:35:20,497 --> 01:35:22,760
Thank you.

1573
01:35:22,847 --> 01:35:23,847
Jesus.

1574
01:35:26,068 --> 01:35:26,938
You know what?

1575
01:35:27,025 --> 01:35:27,591
I want you both out.

1576
01:35:27,678 --> 01:35:28,766
Both.

1577
01:35:28,853 --> 01:35:29,724
Both of you, out.

1578
01:35:29,811 --> 01:35:30,725
Let's move, come on.

1579
01:35:30,812 --> 01:35:31,900
I'm moving.

1580
01:35:36,426 --> 01:35:37,470
Now you move.

1581
01:35:37,557 --> 01:35:39,255
Don't talk to me like that.

1582
01:35:39,342 --> 01:35:43,825
You are in my hotel
room, may I remind you.

1583
01:35:43,912 --> 01:35:47,350
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1584
01:35:47,437 --> 01:35:49,221
I told you to
back the fuck up.

1585
01:35:49,308 --> 01:35:50,962
He's pointing a gun at me.

1586
01:35:51,049 --> 01:35:51,920
Keep your voice down.

1587
01:35:52,007 --> 01:35:54,009
Put the took gun down.

1588
01:35:54,096 --> 01:35:56,011
How do you want this to go?

1589
01:35:56,098 --> 01:35:57,926
How dare you.

1590
01:35:58,013 --> 01:35:59,991
Think I'm going to let some
bitch talk to me like that?

1591
01:36:00,015 --> 01:36:00,755
Come on, friend.

1592
01:36:00,842 --> 01:36:03,453
Come on.

1593
01:36:03,540 --> 01:36:05,063
[mumbling]

1594
01:36:08,937 --> 01:36:10,416
Hey.

1595
01:36:10,503 --> 01:36:12,220
I helped you back there,
why are you doing this?

1596
01:36:12,244 --> 01:36:13,855
Say that to me, man.

1597
01:36:13,942 --> 01:36:15,291
We're brothers.

1598
01:36:15,378 --> 01:36:16,378
Hey.

1599
01:36:19,164 --> 01:36:20,862
Mary-Anne, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1600
01:36:20,949 --> 01:36:22,559
Please.

1601
01:36:22,646 --> 01:36:24,866
Listen to me.

1602
01:36:24,953 --> 01:36:27,390
Wait, please.

1603
01:36:27,477 --> 01:36:29,348
We're both drunk.

1604
01:36:29,435 --> 01:36:31,674
This is going to seem really
fucking stupid in the morning.

1605
01:36:31,698 --> 01:36:33,570
I promise you.

1606
01:36:33,657 --> 01:36:34,919
Charlie.

1607
01:36:35,006 --> 01:36:36,878
We're the same, bro.

1608
01:36:36,965 --> 01:36:41,578
I served, I'm a fucking vet too,
I got the scars to prove it.

1609
01:36:41,665 --> 01:36:44,102
And this ain't how we act.

1610
01:36:49,586 --> 01:36:50,892
Hey.

1611
01:36:50,979 --> 01:36:52,458
And I'm homeless.

1612
01:37:08,866 --> 01:37:10,041
I'm tired, man.

1613
01:37:13,392 --> 01:37:14,392
I'm tired.

1614
01:37:29,931 --> 01:37:31,671
Isn't that yours, that bag?

1615
01:37:31,758 --> 01:37:36,546
He's so drunk, he doesn't
even realize it ain't his.

1616
01:37:36,633 --> 01:37:39,070
Look, this is empty.

1617
01:37:39,157 --> 01:37:41,812
The barrels plugged,
it's for show.

1618
01:37:46,295 --> 01:37:52,779
I don't know if I
heard you right or not.

1619
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:56,914
I'm going to ask you this
one time, one time only, OK?

1620
01:37:57,001 --> 01:37:58,698
I want the god damn
truth, you hear me?

1621
01:37:58,785 --> 01:37:59,785
I do.

1622
01:38:05,967 --> 01:38:09,535
Are you, or are you not?

1623
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:13,060
Yeah.

1624
01:38:15,846 --> 01:38:17,892
Are you?

1625
01:38:17,979 --> 01:38:22,592
Are you Bryan Cranston?

1626
01:38:25,638 --> 01:38:27,989
Not that I'm aware of.

1627
01:38:28,076 --> 01:38:29,860
Get out.

1628
01:38:29,947 --> 01:38:30,817
Out!

1629
01:38:30,905 --> 01:38:31,905
Get out!

1630
01:38:35,344 --> 01:38:36,344
Out!

1631
01:38:43,526 --> 01:38:45,049
Mom, look.

1632
01:38:45,136 --> 01:38:46,790
I put the drawing in
here with the letter.

1633
01:38:46,877 --> 01:38:50,054
Your dad's at the same spot.

1634
01:38:50,141 --> 01:38:51,969
What time is it?

1635
01:38:52,056 --> 01:38:53,449
6:15.

1636
01:38:53,536 --> 01:38:54,929
He's late.

1637
01:38:55,016 --> 01:38:56,539
15 minutes.

1638
01:38:56,626 --> 01:38:58,256
Go wait by the door, and
run out and greet him

1639
01:38:58,280 --> 01:38:59,280
when he gets here.

1640
01:40:03,301 --> 01:40:04,301
Get off!

1641
01:40:26,455 --> 01:40:28,805
No.

1642
01:40:28,892 --> 01:40:30,633
I'm sorry.

1643
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:31,242
You did this?

1644
01:40:31,329 --> 01:40:32,329
Why?

1645
01:40:35,681 --> 01:40:36,681
I don't know.

1646
01:40:53,569 --> 01:40:54,309
Here.

1647
01:40:54,396 --> 01:40:55,396
Give me that.

1648
01:40:59,227 --> 01:41:03,666
I'm a walking target
with this leg, man.

1649
01:41:03,753 --> 01:41:08,236
That gun, it's just
for protection.

1650
01:41:10,847 --> 01:41:16,113
Here rests in honor,
glory an American soldier

1651
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:21,466
known but to God.

1652
01:41:21,553 --> 01:41:24,208
Tomb of the Unknowns.

1653
01:41:24,295 --> 01:41:25,775
You familiar with it?

1654
01:41:29,213 --> 01:41:32,608
My daddy's laying close by.

1655
01:41:32,695 --> 01:41:37,526
Tomb's guarded by soldiers
of the Army's 3rd infantry.

1656
01:41:37,613 --> 01:41:42,226
This badge belonged
to a friend of mine.

1657
01:41:42,313 --> 01:41:43,445
Best friend.

1658
01:41:52,149 --> 01:41:55,761
It was an honor.

1659
01:41:55,848 --> 01:41:57,589
After the astronaut
badge, this is

1660
01:41:57,676 --> 01:42:00,462
the second least awarded
qualification badge

1661
01:42:00,549 --> 01:42:03,421
of the United States Army.

1662
01:42:13,301 --> 01:42:15,433
He'd want you have it.

1663
01:42:19,307 --> 01:42:20,830
It goes here.

1664
01:42:25,922 --> 01:42:26,922
Wear it proudly.

1665
01:42:31,275 --> 01:42:32,711
It's hard-earned.

1666
01:42:55,343 --> 01:42:58,389
I missed you so
much, little man.

1667
01:42:58,476 --> 01:42:59,956
Don't go.

1668
01:43:00,043 --> 01:43:01,697
Please, Dad.

1669
01:43:01,784 --> 01:43:02,524
Hey.

1670
01:43:02,611 --> 01:43:03,612
I'll be back.

1671
01:43:03,699 --> 01:43:06,267
You have my word, I promise.

1672
01:43:06,354 --> 01:43:07,355
I promise.

1673
01:43:18,714 --> 01:43:19,280
Dad?

1674
01:43:19,367 --> 01:43:20,063
Yeah?

1675
01:43:20,150 --> 01:43:22,370
I love you.

1676
01:43:22,457 --> 01:43:23,980
I love you too, boy.

1677
01:43:46,916 --> 01:43:49,397
[sobbing]

1678
01:44:01,278 --> 01:44:02,278
Go, go.

1679
01:44:37,445 --> 01:44:38,446
Let's go.

1680
01:44:38,533 --> 01:44:41,536
Where to?

1681
01:44:41,623 --> 01:44:43,189
It's a surprise.

1682
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:44,277
Get on.

1683
01:44:55,114 --> 01:44:56,899
[music playing]

1684
01:44:56,986 --> 01:45:04,080
[SINGING] It's like a storm
that cuts a path it breaks

1685
01:45:04,167 --> 01:45:08,911
your will, it feels like that.

1686
01:45:08,998 --> 01:45:19,400
You think you're lost, but
you're not lost on your own,

1687
01:45:19,487 --> 01:45:28,234
you're not alone I
will stand by you,

1688
01:45:28,322 --> 01:45:34,763
I will help you through, when
you've done all you can do,

1689
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:42,771
and you can't cope,
I will dry your eyes,

1690
01:45:42,858 --> 01:45:49,386
I will fight your fight,
I will hold you tight,

1691
01:45:49,473 --> 01:45:55,740
and I won't let you fall.

1692
01:45:55,827 --> 01:45:58,743
Don't be afraid to fall.

1693
01:45:58,830 --> 01:46:07,665
I'm right here to catch
you, I won't let you down.

1694
01:46:07,752 --> 01:46:14,106
He won't get you down,
you're going to make it,

1695
01:46:14,193 --> 01:46:22,027
yeah I know you can make it,
because I will stand by you,

1696
01:46:22,114 --> 01:46:29,208
I will help you through, when
you've done all you can do,

1697
01:46:29,295 --> 01:46:31,994
and you can't cope.

1698
01:46:32,081 --> 01:46:40,002
And I will dry your eyes,
I will fight your fights,

1699
01:46:40,089 --> 01:46:48,140
I will hold you tight,
and I won't let go.

1700
01:46:54,016 --> 01:46:58,107
CHARLIE: It's beautiful, man.

1701
01:46:58,194 --> 01:47:01,066
Ain't it?

1702
01:47:01,153 --> 01:47:02,153
Yeah.

1703
01:47:10,902 --> 01:47:12,121
Tell me what's up?

1704
01:47:14,950 --> 01:47:18,910
I made a promise to a friend.

1705
01:47:18,997 --> 01:47:20,782
Friend?

1706
01:47:20,869 --> 01:47:23,698
You know, brother, not all
military casualties of war

1707
01:47:23,785 --> 01:47:27,223
end up in hospitals and
national cemeteries.

1708
01:47:27,310 --> 01:47:33,272
Some make it back, others make
it back, never make it home.

1709
01:47:35,797 --> 01:47:37,146
I want to bring those vets home.

1710
01:47:39,757 --> 01:47:43,631
Trained to save lives, Charlie.

1711
01:47:43,718 --> 01:47:46,677
Suppose we need to
be doing just that.

1712
01:48:45,693 --> 01:48:48,304
Oh, man.

1713
01:48:48,391 --> 01:48:49,697
He's here, man.

1714
01:48:49,784 --> 01:48:51,263
I can feel it.

1715
01:48:55,703 --> 01:48:59,968
522.

1716
01:49:00,055 --> 01:49:04,929
525.

1717
01:49:05,016 --> 01:49:11,327
Oh, 426.

1718
01:49:11,414 --> 01:49:16,288

390.

1722
01:50:20,831 --> 01:50:24,095
First Sergeant
Samuel Gallegos,

1723
01:50:24,182 --> 01:50:28,578
the 3rd infantry division's
first armored brigade combat

1724
01:50:28,665 --> 01:50:29,665
team.

1725
01:50:32,974 --> 01:50:38,066
I great friend, a great soldier.

1726
01:50:40,938 --> 01:50:42,984
American through and through.

1727
01:50:45,856 --> 01:50:47,771
And you.

1728
01:50:47,858 --> 01:50:49,730
Sergeant, First Class Will--

1729
01:50:49,817 --> 01:50:52,907
William Gardner.

1730
01:50:52,994 --> 01:50:55,649
You too are a friend
at the highest order.

1731
01:50:55,736 --> 01:50:58,608
A valiant soldier.

1732
01:50:58,695 --> 01:51:04,788
Your service, your bravery,
your strength of character

1733
01:51:04,875 --> 01:51:08,313
represents what
America stands for.

1734
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:10,054
I salute you, and
it's a real honor

1735
01:51:10,141 --> 01:51:12,535
to be able to thank you
for protecting our country.

1736
01:51:12,622 --> 01:51:17,540
The land of the free,
the home of the brave.

1737
01:51:17,627 --> 01:51:23,459
And your service to
which I will never forget

1738
01:51:23,546 --> 01:51:25,766
And I thank you for yours.

1739
01:51:25,853 --> 01:51:28,899
Much time spent in harm's way.

1740
01:51:28,986 --> 01:51:30,771
Together, brother.

1741
01:51:30,858 --> 01:51:32,033
SAMUEL: Together, brother.

1742
01:51:35,471 --> 01:51:37,342
Well, this is it, man.

1743
01:51:43,740 --> 01:51:44,741
I hate goodbyes.

1744
01:51:44,828 --> 01:51:46,569
SAMUEL: They're the worst.

1745
01:51:46,656 --> 01:51:49,180
But you're on the road to
reclaiming what's yours, Will.

1746
01:51:49,267 --> 01:51:51,922
And that's a beautiful thing.

1747
01:51:55,186 --> 01:51:58,276
Don't go soft on me.

1748
01:51:58,363 --> 01:52:00,539
You helping those
returning soldiers.

1749
01:52:00,626 --> 01:52:03,325
It's good for the heart.

1750
01:52:03,412 --> 01:52:05,675
You know what else
would feed the heart?

1751
01:52:05,762 --> 01:52:07,111
Tell me.

1752
01:52:07,198 --> 01:52:09,810
You clocking
time with your son.

1753
01:52:09,897 --> 01:52:11,812
I intend on it.

1754
01:52:11,899 --> 01:52:13,509
Good, because I demand it.

1755
01:52:13,596 --> 01:52:15,076
That an order?

1756
01:52:15,163 --> 01:52:17,818
If it was, would you take it?

1757
01:52:17,905 --> 01:52:19,863
Ah, well, this one, I might.

1758
01:52:19,950 --> 01:52:22,387
Be a first.

1759
01:52:22,474 --> 01:52:24,650
Hey.

1760
01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:27,175
You need them?

1761
01:52:27,262 --> 01:52:28,262
Bite me.

1762
01:52:31,701 --> 01:52:32,701
Atta boy.

this kiss upon the brow,

1764
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:24,232
and in parting from you
now, thus much let me avow.

1765
01:53:24,319 --> 01:53:27,322
That you are not
wrong who deign,

1766
01:53:27,409 --> 01:53:30,586
that my days have been a drain.

1767
01:53:30,673 --> 01:53:39,160
Yet if hope has flown away, in
a night or in a day, in a vision

1768
01:53:39,247 --> 01:53:47,429
or in none, is it
therefore the less gone?

1769
01:53:47,516 --> 01:53:55,045
All that we see, or seem is
but a dream within a dream.

1771

hand grains of a golden sand.

Ma'am, could you
spare anything?

01:55:56,297 --> 01:55:58,952
I'm trying to get to New
Mexico to see my son.

1778
01:55:59,039 --> 01:56:00,388
I'm so sorry.

I'm sorry.

Excuse me, sir could you
spare a couple dollars?

How few, yet how

01:56:17,666 --> 01:56:27,067
they creep through my fingers
to the deep while I weep.

WILL [VOICEOVER]: Oh,
God, can I not save one

1788
01:58:00,986 --> 01:58:02,379
from the pitiless wave.

1789
01:58:05,208 --> 01:58:13,999
Is all that we see or seem
but a dream within a dream?
