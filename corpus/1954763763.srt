1
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:53,881
Well, can you see anyone you know?

2
00:00:54,683 --> 00:00:56,184
Yeah.

3
00:00:56,684 --> 00:00:58,684
That's you.

4
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:03,185
Will my picture go up there too?

5
00:01:03,586 --> 00:01:06,087
It's up to you.

6
00:01:06,388 --> 00:01:08,888
My part is now done.

7
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,890
You are on your own now.

8
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:18,893
The others are waiting for us.

9
00:06:11,446 --> 00:06:12,947
<i>(Swears)</i>

10
00:09:41,177 --> 00:09:43,178
Unwrap this, Oskari.

11
00:09:46,778 --> 00:09:49,779
It should have a red cross on it.

12
00:09:50,181 --> 00:09:51,181
Yeah.

13
00:09:52,882 --> 00:09:55,382
That is our secret.

14
00:09:55,883 --> 00:09:58,384
A place with guaranteed game.

15
00:09:58,485 --> 00:10:01,485
- Are there deer in there?
- Absolutely.

16
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:04,486
Gorgeous horned ones.

17
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:08,990
Good. I know how to call them.

18
00:10:11,489 --> 00:10:13,790
Rest well -

19
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:16,392
- and wait until the morning.

20
00:10:17,194 --> 00:10:19,894
Remember to move under the wind.

21
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,495
And when the sun rises -

22
00:10:23,697 --> 00:10:25,697
- it's the best moment.

23
00:10:25,798 --> 00:10:28,498
It's when you need to be ready to shoot.

24
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:29,999
Dad?

25
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:33,502
I'll do my best.

26
00:10:33,803 --> 00:10:36,303
Good. You should.

27
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:00,709
Fuel tap.

28
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:08,811
There you go. Show them.

29
00:12:08,822 --> 00:12:10,822
<i>(Swears)</i>

30
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:12,324
Come on! -

31
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,626
- all the way!

32
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,931
The boy will go home.

33
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:41,233
No he won't. The boy is ready.

34
00:12:41,434 --> 00:12:45,935
You'll give the speech like you normally would
and you'll send the boy into the forest.

35
00:12:53,136 --> 00:12:57,138
Well, fine then.
You're the one who will get embarrassed.

36
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,439
Good.

37
00:13:07,142 --> 00:13:09,142
Men!

38
00:13:10,644 --> 00:13:14,144
This little man has hunter's blood
running through his veins.

39
00:13:14,845 --> 00:13:17,845
The boy is now standing in front of men -

40
00:13:17,846 --> 00:13:21,548
- like each one of you has once stood.

41
00:13:21,648 --> 00:13:24,448
Ready to continue the tradition.

42
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:27,751
The boy has one day and one night -

43
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:30,251
- to find out what he is made of.

44
00:13:31,152 --> 00:13:36,653
In the morning he will bring us
what the forest sees fit.

45
00:13:37,254 --> 00:13:39,955
The forest is a harsh judge.

46
00:13:40,455 --> 00:13:43,455
It will give everyone adequately.

47
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:47,258
You need to know how to listen to it.

48
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:52,159
You need to fight tooth and nail for the prey.

49
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,162
You will get nothing for free.

50
00:13:56,962 --> 00:14:00,163
The one who enters the forest is a boy -

51
00:14:00,664 --> 00:14:03,664
- but the one who returns will be.. -

52
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:05,366
- a man.

53
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,790
Testing, testing

54
00:25:27,091 --> 00:25:29,092
One, two, three

55
00:25:29,393 --> 00:25:31,393
Is there anyone there?

56
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:18,209
<i>Happy Birthday
-DAD</i>

57
00:55:15,917 --> 00:55:17,918
The forest is a harsh judge.

58
00:55:18,418 --> 00:55:20,919
It will give everyone adequately.

59
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:23,220
You need to know how to listen to it.

60
00:55:23,522 --> 00:55:27,023
You need to fight tooth and nail for the prey.

61
00:55:32,823 --> 00:55:36,325
You will get nothing for free.

62
01:10:08,483 --> 01:10:10,484
The boy is lost.

63
01:10:11,885 --> 01:10:14,385
Goddamnit. Didn't I warn you?

64
01:10:20,088 --> 01:10:21,288
<i>(Swears)</i>

65
01:10:21,589 --> 01:10:23,589
What the hell?

66
01:12:48,018 --> 01:12:50,317
It's my boy!

67
01:13:16,022 --> 01:13:19,523
Dad. This is..

68
01:13:19,824 --> 01:13:21,325
Bill.

69
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:46,630
Goddamnit, Oskari!

70
01:13:58,133 --> 01:14:01,134
Damn, it's the same guy all right.

71
01:16:44,264 --> 01:16:46,764
Say Cheese.
