00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:38,205
MARIO Hi. You’ve
reached Mario and Patricia.

2
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:39,415
Please leave a message,

3
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,584
and we’ll give you
a call right back.

4
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,577
My love...

5
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,413
We’re finally
getting out of this place,

6
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:20,664
just like I promised.

7
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,669
I sold it.

8
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,797
I sold it to him.

9
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,006
Yes.

10
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,344
I love you.

11
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,597
this thrill before...

12
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,308
MAN:
She would be so proud.

13
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,477
Always be a winner.

14
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:49,360
You want her to be proud
of you, don’t you?

15
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,742
would take wing

16
00:01:56,826 --> 00:02:01,664
would be through...

17
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,737
You’ve gotten old, bitch...

18
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:07,373
Let’s go.

19
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,714
-

20
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,478
-Chole.
-WOMAN: Hi, Lupita.

21
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,402
-Hi, Helen.
-Morning.

22
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,072
-Good morning, Lupita.
-Hi, John.

23
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,164
Hola.

24
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,624
-Hey.
-You, too, huh?

25
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,644
Fucking hipsters.

26
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:16,775
-Oh!

27
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,032
-MAN: Babe, it’s all right.

28
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,616
-Hello, Marcus.
-WOMAN: No, it’s not all right!

29
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,826
Hey. How are you?

30
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,745
¿Qué onda?

31
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,418
You need some help, granny?

32
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,921
You gonna be out here
showing weakness,

33
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,591
you better come on inside
’fore somebody sees you.

34
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:45,012
Mira, shut your cancer hole
and get me my coffee.

35
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,765
-

36
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,936
When are you gonna give up

37
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,648
working on this old thing,
Clarence, eh?

38
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:58,942
When it kills me-- that’s when.

39
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,906
This here’s the only thing
my daddy ever gave me.

40
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,158
-Mm-hmm.
-Told me, once we got her

41
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,993
up and running again,

42
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:11,747
she’d take us all the way
around the world and back.

43
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:16,835
And that is exactly
what I aim to do.

44
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,463
You’d be lucky to make it
out of Oak Springs, eh?

45
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,465
-Ah.
-

46
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,009
Where is Morris’s grumpy ass
this morning?

47
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:27,096
Still convinced he can
get Yolanda’s dryer chair

48
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,555
up and running.

49
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,517
Son of a bitch don’t know an
electrical wire from his dick.

50
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:36,063
Stubborn bastards,
the both of you.

51
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,356
-Stubborn?
-Yeah, yeah.

52
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,191
Now, I know you
ain’t talking, granny.

53
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,861
Morris ain’t
the only one missing

54
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:44,655
round here today, neither.

55
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:49,368
Good old fancy-pants Mario ain’t
showed up for his oil change.

56
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:52,996
He loves that car of his
more than he loved his wife.

57
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:02,589
Sorry. I guess six months
is too soon to be making jokes?

58
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,258
Ah.

59
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,218
Don’t worry about it.

60
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,011
-Ow! Damn it.
-Ay.

61
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,889
YOLANDA: It’s only the chair
that’s broken, Morris,

62
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,933
and I have so many problems
with my landlord already

63
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,601
without you fucking it up.

64
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:17,312
Yolanda, wait a minute. I just
got one more little thing.

65
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,648
-I’m telling you, it’s gonna
be done. -

66
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,694
LUPITA: You’re gonna
mess it up even worse.

67
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,070
MORRIS:
There we go!

68
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:26,530
-

69
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,906
MORRIS:
Shit! Son of a...

70
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,075
Goddamn nearly shat myself.

71
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,495
Laugh it up, you gargoyle, you.

72
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,499
Go check on your greasy
boyfriend at the auto shop.

73
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,001
All right, I’ll see you ladies
tonight, then, huh?

74
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,503
Yolanda, Yolanda,
tomorrow morning,

75
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:43,881
I’m coming back
with the proper tools,

76
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,924
get this whole place
up and running. You’ll see.

77
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:48,427
Thank you, Morris, pero no.

78
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,053
-I’m going to get it done.
-Ay.

79
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,763
-

80
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,770
It still doesn’t
feel right, Lupita.

81
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,689
Ay, por favor, Yolanda.

82
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,941
Going through so much
trouble just for me.

83
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:05,360
We’re the reason Mario can
afford to keep the doors open

84
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:06,737
at the community center.

85
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,072
-This is my problem, and...
Ay, no. Ay. -Look!

86
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,535
I know when your pendejo
landlord raised your rent

87
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,787
how much it hurt you,
and now this?

88
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,498
And that’s nobody’s business
but my own, Lupita.

89
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:21,835
I appreciate everything
you always do

90
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,712
for all of us around here,

91
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,006
but sometimes
I wish you could...

92
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:29,760
Ay, mira.

93
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,553
Did you see my new product?

94
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:34,097
Yeah. Uh-huh.

95
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,061
No Dolores again today.

96
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,812
Pobrecita Dolores.

97
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,899
Ever since they moved in,
I’ve been taking my walks alone.

98
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,776
RAQUEL: Then why the fuck
did you invite us

99
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,736
to stay, then, Dolores, huh?

100
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,322
Because worrying about
my grandson out on the street

101
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,116
keeps me awake at night--
that’s why.

102
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,077
-Caleb, let’s go!
-I’m coming. Damn.

103
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,288
And all of the trouble
that he got into--

104
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:01,583
he’s lucky that he didn’t get
locked up in juvie.

105
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,585
But you know what, probably
would’ve been better for him,

106
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,462
’cause he sure don’t get
no discipline at home.

107
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,838
I said I was sorry.

108
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,257
I mean, it’s not like anybody
got killed or anything.

109
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,843
DOLORES: Where are you going,
anyway? Out shopping?

110
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:13,262
Jesus, Raquel.

111
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:16,139
You haven’t given me a nickel
since you been here,

112
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:19,685
and you’re always out there
shopping and buying clothes

113
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,229
and shit you know damn well
you can’t afford.

114
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,690
RAQUEL: Dolores, I cannot have
this fucking conversation!

115
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:25,816
Caleb, let’s go!

116
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,359
Come on,
your mom’s calling you.

117
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,242
-

118
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,327
RAQUEL:
Come on!

119
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,293
-YOLANDA: Lupita?

120
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,044
-Hmm?
-Don’t you think it’s time

121
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:48,714
to let go of
the gangster bandana, hmm?

122
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,465
No, why?
I love my gangster bandana.

123
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:54,136
-YOLANDA: Oh.

124
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,557
Did you get rid of her?

125
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,351
What my son ever saw

126
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:04,062
in that pasty bitch,
I will never know.

127
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:06,857
-But the boy...

128
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,735
Raquel lets him do
whatever he wants.

129
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,737
She lets him get away
with everything.

130
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,366
My son would’ve raised him
right, but that woman-- mm-mm.

131
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,660
Sounds just like
his daddy to me.

132
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,078
What?

133
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,415
What?

134
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,711
We’re supposed to pretend
your son was perfect?

135
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,630
Por favor, you remember
when him and Eric...

136
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:34,718
I did the best I could
under the circumstances,

137
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,513
and you know more
than anybody how...

138
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:41,516
I-I-I’m not going there
with you. Excuse me.

139
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,477
Okay, señoras,
señoras, señoras.

140
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,854
-Lupita, Lupita.
-Hmm?

141
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,981
-Play nice.
-

142
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:59,117
I should get to
the bingo hall anyway.

143
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:00,202
Dolores.

144
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:03,580
I love you.

145
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,749
-

146
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,250
I love you, too.

147
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,835
Get out of here.

148
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,005
YOLANDA:
Gracias, Lupita.

149
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,804
-Hi, guys.
-Hey, Lupita.

150
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,271
LUPITA:
"Big winner."

151
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,482
-

152
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,454
¿Ay, qué es?

153
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,040
Guácala.

154
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,811
Hi, Helen.

155
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,898
-Hello, darling.
-Hey. How you doing, Lupita?

156
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,109
ERIC: So, you see,
it’s never too late.

157
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,111
Remember, no matter
how many times

158
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,029
you’ve tried to change
and failed,

159
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,614
you’re here now.

160
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:20,907
All right, let’s close it up.

161
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,036
God, grant me the serenity

162
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,538
to accept the things
I cannot change,

163
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,498
the courage to change
the things I can

164
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,208
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

165
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,586
Thanks for coming.

166
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,756
You sound good up there, mijo.

167
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,427
Strong.

168
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,387
Convincing, güey.

169
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,977
I’m so glad you’re
convinced, Doña Lupita.

170
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,479
You here to set up then?

171
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,063
Of course.

172
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,024
Are you joining us tonight?

173
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,484
You know bingo is not my thing.

174
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,652
Maybe in like 50 years
when I’m y’all’s age.

175
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,200
You fool.

176
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,371
It’s weird seeing you
without Ms. Dolores.

177
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,209
She’s got family
to take care of.

178
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,127
Me, I’ve got Oak Springs.

179
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,214
Or what’s left of it.

180
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:21,635
Fucking tanning salons and
shitty coffee shops all over.

181
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:25,639
Well, as long as you’re around,
Oak Springs will never die.

182
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,099
Shit, you are Oak Springs.

183
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,976
You and the rest
of them old fogies.

184
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,772
Come on, after what y’all did,
you and Dolores are legends.

185
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:36,900
Oh. I got it.

186
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,902
Mario gave you
a copy of the keys?

187
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,071
Even with all those tattoos
on your neck?

188
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,949
Nah, these are his.

189
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,451
Found them hanging
from the front door.

190
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:49,871
You just found them?

191
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,915
Doesn’t sound like him.

192
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,042
Did you talk to him, call him?

193
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,337
Nah, I figured Mario, with all
the shit he had to deal with...

194
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,298
Let me see your phone.

195
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,349
MARIO

199
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,527
Could be he really wants
to be alone right now.

200
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,113
Know what I’m saying?

201
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,322
No.

202
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,242

Take time to just kick back
and just relax for once.

206
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,296
Stop shopping
at consignment shops.

207

Get you an upgrade at one
of them new retails opening up.

The next number...

-Check that.

226
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:37,687
You have won one free haircut.

227
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:41,399
And don’t forget
what happened to Samson

228
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:44,319
when he let Delilah give him
a little trim.

229
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:48,782
Ooh...

230
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,493
Yolanda, Yolanda, stand up.
Stand up, please.

00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,453

-DOLORES: Come on, come on,

00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,338
at all your neighbors
who care about you.

235
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,131
Come on, give it up,
Oak Springs.

236
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,258
-Give it up. Hey!
-Go, go, go!

237
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:10,595
I have seen this woman
perform miracles.

238
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:13,473
Look how she transformed me.
I look good, don’t I?

239
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,475
Give me a round of applause.

240
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,560
LUPITA:
Okay, okay, beautiful Dolores.

241
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,896
How much did we raise tonight?

242
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,274

00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,656
...four cents.

245
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,992
Now, which one of y’all
was donating pennies

246
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,994
with your cheap ass?

247
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,579
Morris?

248
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,956
Eh...

249
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,875

Beautiful Princess Yolanda,

Come on. Don’t be shy.

252
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,798
With love from Oak Springs.

00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,259
Come on. We love you.

254
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,681
We take care
of each other here.

255
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,433
This is our home.

256
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,101
Oak Springs!

257
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,980
And we are working hard
to keep it, and we...

258
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,315
-DOLORES: The hell?

259
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,609
-Ay, Morris.
-What?

260
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,279
It’s not like Mario
not to pay his electric bill.

261
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,239
Okay, ladies, next time.

262
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,657
Let’s go, Morris.
Grab the beer.

263
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:16,286
All right, people, game’s over.
Thanks for coming.

264
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,210
Step aside.

265
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:25,545
I’ll take care of it.

266
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,338
Mario gave you a copy?

267
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:28,798
-Please.

268
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,259
As if you wasn’t
in his business enough.

269
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:34,929
Damn, gave me
a shitty copy anyway. Mm.

270
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:44,230
Oh. Nice ride.

271
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:46,816
It damn sure don’t belong
to nobody around here.

272
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,944
It’s the same guy
I saw earlier.

273
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,821
Whose car is this?

274
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,490
And why is it here, hmm?

275
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:57,243
Probably one of them
rich hipster assholes.

276
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:00,413
-What about Mario?
-What about Mario?

277
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:03,041
Clarence told me
he didn’t show up

278
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,375
for his car appointment
this morning.

279
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,044
His car appointment?

280
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,253
Yeah, yeah.

281
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,005
Should we call
the National Guard?

282
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:14,552
Eric said Mario’s keys were just
hanging from the door earlier.

283
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:17,555
Lupita, the man is old,
in case you haven’t noticed.

284
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:20,683
And the power,
the power going out.

285
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,895
Lupita, the man
just lost his wife

286
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:28,691
after years of watching the
cancer just eat away at her.

287
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:32,403
I can’t imagine what something
like that does to your head,

288
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:36,324
so how about we just cut him
a little slack

289
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:39,160
about being forgetful, okay?

290
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,039
Let’s stop by his house!

291
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:48,837
No, we are not
stopping by his house.

292
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,381
It’s been six months.

293
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,550
Let’s leave him alone.

294
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,053
What if it’s something else?

295
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,724
Lord, if you’re listening,
there’s a crazy woman down here.

296
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,936
Dolores, I got that feeling.

297
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:08,356
And you know more than anybody
what that feeling means.

298
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:11,401
Yeah, I know what it means.

299
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,903
-A pain in my ass!

300
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,869
Don’t touch that car!

301
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,161
Oh, God.

302
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:24,414
Lupita, it’s late. Come on.

303
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,959
Let’s go so we can get
some rest, for God’s sake.

304
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,211
And tomorrow,
if you haven’t heard from him,

305
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:31,296
we do it your way.

306
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,965
You never let me
do fucking anything.

307
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,769
MARIO Hi. You’ve
reached Mario and Patricia.

308
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:47,979
Please leave a message,

309
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,939

right back.

310
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,253
"Under new management."

311
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,130
Ay, Mario, what did you do?

312
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,852
¡Hijos de la chingada!

313
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:47,038
-LUPITA: Mario.

314
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,040
How could you sell it, Mario?

315
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:50,375
Mario!

316
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,961
Want to talk to me
about the bingo hall?

317
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,837
Eh?

318
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,383
I know you’re in there!

319
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,010
Mario!

320
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:06,099
You cook now?

321
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,517
Good morning to you, too.

322
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,602
I just thought it would
be nice. That’s all.

323
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,729
Well, you’re burning the eggs.

324
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,191
Uh, no soda before break...

325
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:19,320
Oh, so it’s on now.

326
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,406
-Ah.
-RAQUEL: All right.

327
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:24,075
Smells good, right?

328
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,535
Oh, and that coffee--

329
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,329
I got that good stuff from
that new place down the street.

330
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,206
None of that
store-bought bullshit.

331
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,583
-CALEB: Real good, Mom.
-Thank you.

332
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:35,503
DOLORES: Are there some
hidden cameras in here?

333
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:40,508
’Cause you can cut the BS and
tell me what this is all about.

334
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:47,724
I just wanted to do something
to show my appreciation...

335
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,768
our appreciation for you.

336
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,524
You want something.

337
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,152
Money.

338
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,737
That’s it. Mm-hmm.

339
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,739
No, I know.

340
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,532
A job, right?
You got a new job.

341
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,117
That means we can
move back home now.

342
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,660
Mom, please tell me
that we’re

343
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:09,162
-moving back home. -How you
gonna burn up my good bacon

344
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,496
and at the same time...?

345
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,664
CALEB: You said we would only
be here for a little while.

346
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:12,874
-DOLORES: Why don’t you
take back... -Mom.

347
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,667
...some of those new clothes
that you bought?

348
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,377
-But no...
-

349
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,716
I already took the clothes
back, for your information.

350
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:24,010
I just leave the tags on,
and I take them back

351
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,054
-when I’m done with them, so...
-Raquel.

352
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:31,184
How about if
I take you shopping

353
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:35,188
and buy you some clothes that
you can cut the tag off of?

354
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,939
How about that, huh?

355
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,320
I’ll be fine.

356
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:45,198
And for the record, I bought
that coffee with my money.

357
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,951
Fuck this.

358
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:53,289
And for your information,
I prefer store-bought

359
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,416
to this liquid cat shit.

360
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:03,591
Posted on my door,
your door and everyone else.

361
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,676
Should I grab my shotgun?

362
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,221
You know I still keep it
in the kitchen.

363
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:14,018
"New management."

364
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,230
Still no word from Mario?

365
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,315
Stopped by this morning,
saw his car.

366
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,983
No answer.

367
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,819
I-If Mario’s looking to sell,
we can’t just...

368
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,446
Sell? No, hombre.
No, no, por favor.

369
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,491
Mario had a moment of weakness.

370
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:32,745
But we won’t let that happen,
will we?

371
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,044
Hell, Lupita, you knew Mario.

372
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:42,213
He was never happy here.

373
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:43,923
-And when Patricia died...
-MORRIS: Hey, hey. Whoa.

374
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,300
Oak Springs
has been good to us.

375
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:48,344
You have been good to us.

376
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,012
-But look, Lupita...
-But what? But what?

377
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:53,141
We’ve been struggling a long
time, granny. You know that.

378
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:55,226
We love this neighborhood.

379
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:58,396
But the people in this town have
been doing pretty goddamn good

380
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:01,065
selling their property
to these rich bastards.

381
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:04,360
And I don’t know, but sometimes
it don’t sound so bad.

382
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,821
You’d piss your chones if I told
you the offer I got on my house.

383
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,030
We all get the letters.

384
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,074
I don’t blame Mario.

385
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:12,368
Shit, for the right price,

386
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,538
I could be laying on a beach
somewhere in a string bikini.

387
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,290
-YOLANDA: Lupita.

388
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:20,501
Don’t you think
we deserve better?

389
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,296
Look, I’m a loyal man.
You all know that.

390
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,340
Even when things got hard,
I stayed.

391
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:29,760
I stayed out of loyalty to you,
Lupita. You understand?

392
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:32,430
But where did all that loyalty
get me? Where? What?

393
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,265
Nothing but pain. That’s what.

394
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,392
You’re abandoning your home
for a little bit of money.

395
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,227
-No.
-DOLORES: Lupita.

396
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:41,314
None of us
are what we used to be.

397
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,065
But we’re still here.

398
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:47,278
Little older, little crankier.

399
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,197
-But damn it...

400
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:53,743
...we’re still here.

401
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,411
We are.

402
00:24:56,996 --> 00:25:00,082
Where we have always been.

403
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,211
-Sí.
-

404
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:05,338
What’s the plan, granny?

405
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:18,059
We show up tonight
and give this big asshole

406
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:21,020
a proper Oak Springs welcome.

407
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:23,356
-YOLANDA: Andale.

408
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:44,168
Looks like a goddamn casino.

409
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:47,505
Is it even possible
to do all this in one night?

410
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,006
Of course it’s possible.

411
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,259
Shit, come on,
I could’ve done it in less.

412
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:54,303
Morris, you would’ve burned
the building down to the ground.

413
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:56,681
I’d rather see a pile of ashes

414
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:59,767
than whatever the hell
I’m looking at now.

415
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,856
Let’s go introduce ourselves
to this pinche gringo.

416
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,694
Now, now, now, now, w-w-wait.
We don’t know he’s white.

417
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,654
ALL:
He’s white.

418
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,824
-

419
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,123
Holy shit.

420
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:23,916
You can say that again.

421
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,960
-Oh, what?
-Oh...

422
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:38,931
YOLANDA: Can you imagine the
electricity bill for this place?

423
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:40,016
Hey!

424
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,976
For a bingo hall
in Oak Springs,

425
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,728
this is a bit of an overkill,

426
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:45,271
-if you ask me.
-Ay.

427
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,565
Hey, Lupita.

428
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:49,608
-Lupita.
- ¿Qué?

429
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:51,485
Don’t you think
we should play, too?

430
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:54,196
You know, to blend in?

431
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,449
We are not playing.

432
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:57,867
And to be honest,

433
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,412
all of these people should
be ashamed of themselves.

434
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:02,872
That was a good idea.

435
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,874
LUPITA: It’s not...
it’s not a good idea.

436
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,515
Is that Raquel over there?

437
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,228
That bitch.

438
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:29,648
Stay focused.

439
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:31,901
-She’s here trying to
get rich quick. -Come.

440
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,944
LUPITA:
Sit. Sit there.

441
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,824
Mario’s been gone a day,
and all it takes

442
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:41,994
is some blinking lights
to make them forget.

443
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:44,705
Makes me sick.

444
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,169
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen
of Oak Springs...

445
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,340
I’ve got one question for you.

446
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:59,303
Are you feeling lucky?

447
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,695
Well, you can call me Mr. Big.

448
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:21,200
And it is an absolute pleasure

449
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:25,329
to welcome you all here
to the grand opening of...

450
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,708
...of Mr. Big’s Bingo!

451
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:31,794
LUPITA:
No.

452
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:35,464
Well, here at Mr. Big’s Bingo,
we have only big prizes.

453
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:39,927
Because everyone
deserves to be a winner.

454
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:44,265
I look around this
beautiful community of yours,

455
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:45,933
and you know what I see?

456
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:47,935
I see dreams.

457
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:51,439
Big-time dreams.

458
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:55,568
I see potential in Oak Springs,
all these unfulfilled desires.

459
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:59,989
And each and every one of you
has a big dream.

460
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,532
I mean, who doesn’t?

461
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:03,325
Am I right?

462
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,539
No matter how happy,

463
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:11,667
no matter how content
you may be,

464
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,379
we all have that one thing,

465
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:20,801
that one little thing
that we still yearn for.

466
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:25,556
Like an eternal itch
you just can’t scratch.

467
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:28,184
They say money
can’t buy you happiness.

468
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:32,021
I disagree.

469
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:35,941
You know what kinds of people
believe this nonsense?

470
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:39,153
Losers.

471
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:40,446
-

472
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,364
MAN:
Losers?

473
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:45,493
Now, tell me, Oak Springs,
are you losers?

474
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:48,829
-CROWD: No! No!
-Losers!

475
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:51,832
MR. BIG:
No.

476
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,587
How about you, my dear?

477
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:01,342
What’s the one thing
you most desire?

478
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:06,305
What would bring you happiness?

479
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,141
A new life.

480
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,104
A new life, hmm?

481
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:29,119
Well, here at Mr. Big’s Bingo,
you could win enough money

482
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:32,206
to buy that new life
ten times over.

483
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:38,212
Who’s ready to play the game?

484
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:10,286
MAN:
Hey! Hey!

485
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,246
-Oh, shit.

486
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,039
MAN: Yeah, you better run,
little shit.

487
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:23,215
B-14.

488
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:33,434
G-46.

489
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,739
G-51.

490
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,867
RAQUEL:
Bing... Wait.

491
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,952
Bingo. Bingo! Bingo!

492
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:53,954
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I have bingo!

493
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:56,040
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

494
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:58,125
-Oh, my God! -You want it bad
enough, ladies and gentlemen,

495
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,794
the luck will find you.

496
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:02,921
Well, come on up, big winner.

497
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,971
-Let’s see what you won.
-Oh, God.

498
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,942
Holy shit.

499
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,280
ANNOUNCER:
$10,000.

500
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:32,993
Holy shit!

501
00:32:33,077 --> 00:32:35,079
I knew we should’ve played.

502
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,122
I told you it was a good idea.

503
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:41,543
-Oh, my God.

504
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,254
MR. BIG:
Come back tomorrow night.

505
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:48,842
Come back every night, where
the prizes will be even bigger.

506
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:53,097
Or miss your chance to make
all your dreams come true.

507
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,641
RAQUEL:
Yes! Fuck yes!

508
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:58,143
And everyone deserves
to be a winner.

509
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,759
-CALEB: Mom?
-

510
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,431
Mom?

511
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:38,475
Can we talk about yesterday?

512
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,227
I didn’t mean...

513
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,272
I’m sorry. I didn’t...

514
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:54,867
Mom.

515
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,869
Mom! Mom, no!

516
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,328
Mom, no!

517
00:33:58,412 --> 00:33:59,872
Caleb, what’s going on?

518
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:02,541
Where’s your mom?

519
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,687
No, you didn’t.

520
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:25,731
RAQUEL:
A new life.

521
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:28,150
That pasty bitch.

522
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:35,991
by the dozens

523
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,911
new cousins

524
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,208
than money buys

525
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:47,419
-Look at me!

526
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:49,004
in balance

527
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,966
she don’t try

528
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:56,261
than money can buy

529
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:15,864
-

530
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,339
there’s a wrinkle

531
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:35,509
there’s a twinkle

532
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,344
-

533
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:39,471
than money can buy

534
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:41,640
Rich, bitch!

535
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:44,059
She’s got
smarts that you don’t see...

536
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:51,525
RAQUEL: You look just like
your fucking grandma

537
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:52,985
when you look at me
like that.

538
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,445
-Like I’m a loser.
-CALEB: I never said that.

539
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:57,197
RAQUEL:
You think your mom is a loser?

540
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:59,366
You don’t think I can make it
without your dad?

541
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:00,909
I don’t know
if I have what it takes

542
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:03,245
to be a mother
without your dad.

543
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,291
-I went from being Raquel...
-

544
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,126
to being Caleb’s mom.

545
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,880
She had to give up
all her hopes and dreams

546
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,590
for her kid just like that.

547
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,384
If I ever wanted anything
for myself...

548
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:18,927
I just want to remember
what it’s like to be me.

549
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:21,054
Oh, I would be
a really shitty mom.

550
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:23,473
I would be a selfish,
cold-hearted fucking bitch.

551
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:53,962
MR. BIG:
All the desperate souls...

552
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:57,215
-we feed off them.
-

553
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:02,804
Now, tell me, Oak Springs,
are you losers?

554
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,899
MR. BIG:
Oh, that’s it.

555
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,901
-That’s it.
-

556
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:19,321
Always be a winner.

557
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:25,494
How do you know for sure
she left?

558
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:28,664
She left me a shiny nickel.

559
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:32,751
Now, that’s what she does.

560
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,837
She left my son
I don’t know how many times,

561
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:39,883
running off doing God knows
what with a baby at home.

562
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:47,182
I can’t stop thinking
about last night-- that man.

563
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,935
That nasty smile of his,
that...

564
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,728
Oh, please, Lupita.

565
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:54,106
Don’t start all of that
again, okay?

566
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,316
And that prize?

567
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,277
You ever seen a bingo game
with a prize like that?

568
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:03,740
No. I’ve lived in Oak Springs
most of my life, remember?

569
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:06,243
Oak Springs
seems like the last place

570
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:08,203
to open a big-money
bingo hall.

571
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:12,457
Well, Oak Springs is changing,
so maybe it’s perfect for all

572
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:13,667
those new tech companies
moving in.

573
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:17,295
Ese hombre is a snake.

574
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:21,425
Those flyers were meant for us.

575
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,644
We need to find Mario!

576
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:34,730
-No.
-Maybe he knows something.

577
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,106
Lupita.

578
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,316
What are you doing, Dolores?
Get up.

579
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,609
Vamonos. Órale.

580
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:41,737
I don’t have the time
or the energy

581
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,240
to be playing Batman and Robin
with your behind.

582
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,242
Those days are long gone.

583
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:03,800
I’ll handle this shit myself.

584
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:13,602
Please don’t do nothing crazy.

585
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,169
I don’t give a fuck...

586
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,584
Mario?

587
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:22,879
Mario?

588
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:40,147
Mario?

589
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:07,883
Mario.

590
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,137
Mario.

591
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,847
What is this?

592
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,642
What happened to you, Mario?

593
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,772
-

594
00:41:57,224 --> 00:41:59,226
Caleb?

595
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:04,481
I’m stopping by Miss Lupita’s.

596
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:07,776
Make sure she didn’t
do nothing stupid.

597
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,404
DOLORES Okay?

598
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:16,201
All right, now,
I won’t be long.

599
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:21,122
I’m leaving my cell phone on
the counter in case you need it.

600
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:59,619
I want to tell you

601
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:14,467
got problems

602
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:18,596
some are poor

603
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:22,767
are for real

604
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,399
Welcome to the game, gentlemen.

605
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:37,198
some dues to pay

606
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:40,618
-Now, who’s ready to win big?
-

607
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:42,996
your very dying day

608
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:46,374
-

609
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:26,414
Ay, Dios.

610
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:28,166
Ay, Dios mío.

611
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:21,970
-

612
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:30,914
MR. BIG:
You...

613
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:35,585
...lose.

614
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:58,066
-Aah! Whoa.

615
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,527
-I come in peace, woman.
-Come in. Come in.

616
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:04,989
Have you been resting?

617
00:47:05,073 --> 00:47:08,117
’Cause I know how you get when
you haven’t had your siesta.

618
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:11,162
It’s not... It’s not...

619
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:13,873
I swear to God I just...

620
00:47:13,957 --> 00:47:15,375
in the hallway...

621
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,168
Hey, hey. Take a breath.

622
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:23,591
Let that brain of yours rest
for one evening.

623
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:28,346
Lupita, what?

624
00:48:05,258 --> 00:48:06,884
If you’re out
hitting up cars again,

625
00:48:06,968 --> 00:48:08,928
you’re in the wrong part
of town, little homey.

626
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:11,639
Look, man,
I didn’t take nothing...

627
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:14,017
Find something good in there?

628
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:29,198
Not here to fuck with you...
Caleb.

629
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:32,869
I knew your pops
back in the day.

630
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:36,080
We used to get into
all kinds of trouble together.

631
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:38,875
-You knew my dad?

632
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:43,171
He was like a brother to me.

633
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:46,633
When I heard what happened
to him, I felt that shit.

634
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:48,468
Sorry you had to
go through that.

635
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:51,220
I grew up without parents, too.

636
00:48:51,304 --> 00:48:53,514
I had to make my own family.

637
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:55,516
Other kids as screwed up as me.

638
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,393
Not your pops.

639
00:48:57,477 --> 00:48:59,562
I’m talking about real fuckups.

640
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,442
Dealing just to get by.

641
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:06,027
Started using after a while.

642
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:08,446
Where’s your friends now?

643
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:09,822
Dead.

644
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:15,745
As long as I had my high and
my money, I was good with it.

645
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:19,624
It was like an infection.

646
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,293
Ain’t no cure for that shit.

647
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:28,174
Well, you got clean,
didn’t you?

648
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:30,885
Getting clean ain’t the same
thing as getting cured.

649
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:34,180
That taste...
that taste is permanent.

650
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:38,059
Every morning, I feel the urge,

651
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:42,647
and every morning, I got to make
the choice to ignore that shit.

652
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:52,865
Well, if you got better,
why do you still live here?

653
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:55,034
-What’s wrong with Oak Springs?
-It sucks here.

654
00:49:55,118 --> 00:49:57,787
There’s, like, nothing
but a bunch of old people.

655
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,956
Except for you,

656
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:03,042
-and you’re still kind of old.
-

657
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:05,712
That’s ’cause most
everybody else gone already.

658
00:50:05,795 --> 00:50:09,048
Those old people are the closest
thing to a family I ever had.

659
00:50:09,132 --> 00:50:11,300
Lupita’s been
like a mother to me.

660
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:13,219
That mean old Mexican lady?

661
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:15,430
Yeah, that mean
old Mexican lady.

662
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:19,016
Man, Lupita cleaned up
this whole neighborhood,

663
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,102
helped kids like me
get our shit together.

664
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:23,020
And not just Lupita.

665
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:25,732
-Your grandma, too.
- Yeah, right.

666
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:28,109
Those ladies were like
superheroes around here,

667
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:29,402
for real.

668
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:32,530
Ran those damn gangs
out of here like that.

669
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:36,325
They built it up from nothing.

670
00:50:37,452 --> 00:50:38,703
That’s why Lupita’s
so protective

671
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:40,163
of the neighborhood, you know?

672
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:47,462
Last night,

673
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:48,921
I heard my grandma talking

674
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:52,383
about how my mom won big
at this new bingo place.

675
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:55,344
And this morning, she was gone.

676
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:59,265
If only I could get some money.

677
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:01,768
I don’t know.

678
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:08,733
She’s gonna come back for me.

679
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,575
I hope you’re right,
little homey.

680
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:19,160
I hope you’re right.

681
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,415
B-13!

682
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:25,875
CLARENCE:
Bingo!

683
00:51:29,212 --> 00:51:30,922
Bingo! Bingo!

684
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:33,174
Bingo!

685
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:35,218
-Son of a bitch!
-Come on, Oak Springs.

686
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:37,970
Let’s hear it for
the big winner of the night.

687
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:41,974
It’s all on me, baby.
It’s all on me.

688
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:51,651
-ANNOUNCER: $100,000.
-MR. BIG: Big winner.

689
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:53,236
Holy shit.

690
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:12,004
Cocksucker.

691
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:15,299
Will you please say something?

692
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:17,718
What can I say?

693
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:21,514
I want you to say
you will help me stop him.

694
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:24,225
What if he did something
to Raquel to make her leave?

695
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,602
How do we know he didn’t
take her out already

696
00:52:26,686 --> 00:52:27,687
like he did Mario?

697
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:28,771
Take her out?

698
00:52:28,855 --> 00:52:31,315
-Yes.
-You are losing your mind.

699
00:52:31,399 --> 00:52:34,902
Dolores, you didn’t
see the way Mario was.

700
00:52:34,986 --> 00:52:36,904
There was money.

701
00:52:36,988 --> 00:52:38,614
There was green slime.

702
00:52:38,698 --> 00:52:40,825
It wasn’t natural. It was evil.

703
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:42,535
-And...
-Okay, okay.

704
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:44,996
What did the cops
have to say about it?

705
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:46,789
Oh, please.

706
00:52:46,873 --> 00:52:50,585
Since when have we trusted
anything the cops have to say?

707
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:52,461
They don’t care.

708
00:52:52,545 --> 00:52:54,422
And they don’t know Mario
like I do.

709
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:57,884
Mario hated his life
in Oak Springs

710
00:52:57,967 --> 00:53:00,636
even before Patricia died.

711
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:05,391
You were just too stubborn
to accept it.

712
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:12,523
What if he felt stuck,

713
00:53:12,607 --> 00:53:14,233
with no way out?

714
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:15,943
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

715
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:17,403
Don’t even say it.

716
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:20,156
Maybe he just got tired
of fighting a battle

717
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:23,784
he knew
that he had already lost.

718
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:27,204
And he’s not the only one
who feels that way.

719
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:32,668
When my son got sick...

720
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:41,510
I’m not doing this.

721
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:46,599
Whew.

722
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:48,100
Where are you going?

723
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:49,894
To be with my grandson.

724
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,521
He’s what matters most now.

725
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:54,565
Oak Springs is all I have.

726
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:57,151
He’s taking over,
and we have to do something.

727
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,903
This is our goddamn neighbor...

728
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:01,614
I am talking about my grandson.

729
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:05,493
To hell with this neighborhood!

730
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:10,331
I have fought with you
almost my whole life.

731
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:11,499
We all have.

732
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:14,543
And what do we have
to show for it?

733
00:54:14,627 --> 00:54:16,087
Nada.

734
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:20,007
No money, no family, no future.

735
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:25,179
But we got Oak Springs, right?

736
00:54:27,974 --> 00:54:30,810
And because of you...

737
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:36,816
...we’re probably all
going to die right here

738
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:41,153
in good old Oak Springs.

739
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:48,619
Don’t make me
fight this alone, please.

740
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:52,373
The fight is over.

741
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:25,156
RAQUEL: Caleb’s
your problem now, Dolores.

742
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:28,242
-Mom, Mom... Stop.
-

743
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:33,581
-I’m rich, bitch.
-Stop, Mom. Stop. Stop. Stop.

744
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:36,208
Stop! Stop!
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

745
00:55:38,461 --> 00:55:41,338
in New Orleans

746
00:55:41,422 --> 00:55:43,591
Mmm, mmm.

747
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:54,643
of many poor girls

748
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:59,648
I’m one...

749
00:56:07,073 --> 00:56:09,325
Me and you...

750
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:13,037
gonna take a ride across this
whole goddamn world together!

751
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:16,540
Just like my daddy said.

752
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:19,835
Leave all the bullshit behind.

753
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:40,981
-

754
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:46,862
That’s what I’m talking about!

755
00:56:53,244 --> 00:56:55,496
-

756
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:57,665
-

757
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:03,295
MR. BIG:
No matter how happy,

758
00:57:03,379 --> 00:57:05,965
no matter how content
you may be...

759
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:07,716
Almost perfect.

760
00:57:16,267 --> 00:57:20,312
to New Orleans...

761
00:57:20,396 --> 00:57:25,025
MR. BIG: ...we’ve all
got that one little thing

762
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:27,069
we still yearn for.

763
00:57:28,154 --> 00:57:30,406
Stubborn bastards.

764
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:33,951
You’d be lucky to get out
of Oak Springs alive.

765
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:49,300
-

766
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:52,511
One more little tweak...

767
00:57:52,595 --> 00:57:56,765
-...and we’ll be ready to ride.

768
00:57:58,225 --> 00:57:59,894
-

769
00:59:34,113 --> 00:59:36,615
Yolanda! Yolanda!

770
00:59:40,703 --> 00:59:42,496
Chingada madre.

771
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:46,500
-Chingado...

772
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:00,639
Clarence!

773
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:04,560
Are you in there?

774
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:06,729
Clarence!

775
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:09,815
Chingado.

776
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:17,031
-

777
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:53,025
-

778
01:00:55,027 --> 01:00:57,112
-

779
01:01:00,282 --> 01:01:02,368
-

780
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:35,169
-Caleb.

781
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:37,463
Caleb!

782
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:39,173
Come help me.
The light’s out again.

783
01:03:33,894 --> 01:03:36,104
MR. BIG: And everyone
deserves to be a winner.

784
01:04:52,264 --> 01:04:54,266
Dolores! Caleb!

785
01:05:08,989 --> 01:05:10,949
No, no, no, no!

786
01:05:15,203 --> 01:05:17,039
-Eric, es Lupita.
-ERIC: Hello?

787
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:18,790
I need your help,
mijo, pero ahorita.

788
01:05:18,874 --> 01:05:20,042
Hello? Hello?

789
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:21,335
Lupita?

790
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:22,961
Lupita, tell me where you are.

791
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:24,588
I’ll come get you.

792
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:27,174
Hello? Lupita!

793
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:37,809
No more games.

794
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:17,140
-ERIC: Oye, Lupita.
- ¿Qué?

795
01:06:19,017 --> 01:06:21,061
I’m with you all the way.

796
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:23,271
Eric, be careful, mijo.

797
01:06:24,398 --> 01:06:26,233
We are all that’s left.

798
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:30,696
Ya vete, cabrón.

799
01:06:30,779 --> 01:06:32,030
You’re going to make me cry.

800
01:06:32,114 --> 01:06:34,700
Okay, I’ll go around back.

801
01:06:34,783 --> 01:06:36,326
Chingada madre.

802
01:06:41,248 --> 01:06:43,041
What the hell
are you doing here? No.

803
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:44,918
No, don’t get in there,
Caleb! No!

804
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,003
-

805
01:06:58,473 --> 01:06:59,975
MR. BIG: Come back every night,

806
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:02,894
where the prizes
will be even bigger,

807
01:07:02,978 --> 01:07:06,481
or miss your chance to make
all your dreams come true.

808
01:07:08,483 --> 01:07:09,943
And everyone deserves
to be a winner.

809
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:11,027
Loser!

810
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:12,654
Caleb! Caleb.

811
01:07:12,738 --> 01:07:13,780
Caleb!

812
01:07:15,282 --> 01:07:17,784
-Fuck you.
-Come on, Caleb.

813
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:19,202
-It’s too late.
-Come on.

814
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:22,789
I made my decision.

815
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:26,501
Oh, you’re hard now, huh?

816
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,172
Well, go ahead, big man.

817
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,924
Go ahead.

818
01:07:34,009 --> 01:07:35,135
You gonna use that thing
or what?

819
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:36,428
Stop!

820
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:38,930
You don’t know me
or anything about my family.

821
01:07:39,014 --> 01:07:40,307
You don’t understand.

822
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:41,475
I have to do this.

823
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:43,393
-With this money, I can...
-You can what?

824
01:07:43,477 --> 01:07:45,437
Buy your mama back?

825
01:07:47,481 --> 01:07:49,274
Money ain’t real, man.

826
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:51,193
It can’t solve your problems.

827
01:07:52,903 --> 01:07:54,529
Trust me.

828
01:07:55,864 --> 01:07:57,657
This shit...

829
01:07:57,741 --> 01:07:59,326
this shit ain’t the answer.

830
01:08:11,463 --> 01:08:13,006
I’m sorry.

831
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:16,718
It’s all right, Caleb.

832
01:08:24,893 --> 01:08:26,144
Caleb!

833
01:08:36,905 --> 01:08:38,240
Morris.

834
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:56,883
I won’t let him have you.

835
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,803
You don’t matter.

836
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,221
Can’t you see that?

837
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:02,722
You’re nothing.

838
01:09:02,806 --> 01:09:06,226
All you are is in the way.

839
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:09,312
I’m going to be a winner.

840
01:09:11,398 --> 01:09:15,402
I don’t need you.

841
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:22,117
Yolanda.

842
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:24,452
Yolanda.

843
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,176
ERIC:
Caleb!

844
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:41,803
Easy.

845
01:09:41,887 --> 01:09:43,221
Easy, man.

846
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:46,474
Let him go!
Leave him alone, man! Wait.

847
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:51,396
What the fuck do you want?

848
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:58,153
It’s what you want
that matters.

849
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,574
You feel it every morning,

850
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:06,745
and every morning,
you deny yourself.

851
01:10:06,828 --> 01:10:09,831
Don’t deny yourself, Eric.

852
01:10:09,915 --> 01:10:11,124
That’s it.

853
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,543
That’s it.

854
01:10:30,101 --> 01:10:31,603
I won’t deny myself.

855
01:10:31,686 --> 01:10:33,355
Eric, no! No!

856
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:34,439
Eric, no!

857
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:48,411
No!

858
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:06,304
I’m sorry.

859
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:10,934
Winners only.

860
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:37,377
Always be a winner.

861
01:11:45,552 --> 01:11:49,222
Wouldn’t want to end up like
your mother, now, would you?

862
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:53,351
Although she did smile
right up until the very end.

863
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:29,137
You were right, Dolores.

864
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:32,057
I let this happen.

865
01:12:34,142 --> 01:12:36,478
But it’s not too late.

866
01:12:40,982 --> 01:12:45,278
We may be older, but we still
have plenty of life to live.

867
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:46,738
You hear me?

868
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:03,546
Oak Springs, listen up.

869
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:09,803
When our neighbors
started leaving Oak Springs...

870
01:13:11,471 --> 01:13:15,100
...I called them
cowards and traitors.

871
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:18,019
But I was wrong.

872
01:13:19,104 --> 01:13:23,650
I thought that a neighborhood

873
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:26,653
and a community
were the same thing.

874
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:29,823
A neighborhood is just a place.

875
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:34,953
Oak Springs is more than that.

876
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:37,872
We are Oak Springs.

877
01:13:37,956 --> 01:13:39,499
Us, the people.

878
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:41,835
And when Oak Springs
works together,

879
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:45,004
there is not a pinche thing
in this world

880
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:46,673
that can defeat us!

881
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:03,648
Ladies and gentlemen...

882
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:07,610
...and special guests...

883
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:12,699
...welcome to Mr. Big’s Bingo’s

884
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:15,869
Million Dollar Game.

885
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:21,666
Now, which one of you deserves
to be a millionaire?

886
01:14:21,749 --> 01:14:23,835
No!

887
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:26,171
Don’t listen to him!
Don’t listen to him!

888
01:14:46,566 --> 01:14:48,568
Oh, can’t you see, Lupita?

889
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:50,904
I’m just the same as you.

890
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:52,989
You’re nothing like me.

891
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:54,991
Oh? Is that so?

892
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:58,411
Surrounding ourselves
with desperate souls.

893
01:15:00,413 --> 01:15:02,373
Fixing the game
so they need us.

894
01:15:02,457 --> 01:15:04,459
So, they can’t live without us.

895
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:06,336
Caging them in.

896
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:08,838
And then we feed off ’em

897
01:15:08,922 --> 01:15:12,759
again and again and again

898
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:16,471
-and again and again and again!
-

899
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:23,311
We use promises
like leashes, huh?

900
01:15:23,394 --> 01:15:26,564
Oh, keep ’em close, Lupita.

901
01:15:26,648 --> 01:15:29,317
Keep ’em close. Keep ’em close.

902
01:15:30,652 --> 01:15:32,862
Ah. Huh.

903
01:15:32,946 --> 01:15:34,739
Now...

904
01:15:35,949 --> 01:15:38,326
It’s game time!

905
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:48,127
G-59!

906
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:09,816
Oh, B-11!

907
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:15,947
CALEB:
Hey, fuck head.

908
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,086
Shit!

909
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,261
Oh, fuck.

910
01:16:42,557 --> 01:16:44,976
-Wake up. Wake up, please.
-

911
01:16:46,144 --> 01:16:47,228
Come on, old lady. Wake up.

912
01:16:47,312 --> 01:16:49,272
Wake up, please.

913
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:50,982
Lupita, please, wake up.

914
01:16:51,065 --> 01:16:52,608
MORRIS:
Yolanda!

915
01:16:52,692 --> 01:16:55,278
Yolanda. Yolanda.

916
01:17:09,751 --> 01:17:11,753
Lupita, please, wake up.

917
01:17:15,006 --> 01:17:16,174
Come on, lady, wake up.

918
01:17:30,355 --> 01:17:32,190
-

919
01:17:38,029 --> 01:17:42,075
You picked the wrong community,
motherfucker!

920
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:46,871
Fucker. You’re mine.

921
01:17:46,954 --> 01:17:48,414
-

922
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:56,214
Piece of shit!

923
01:17:56,297 --> 01:17:57,548
¡Dale!

924
01:17:59,092 --> 01:18:00,968
¡Hijo de puta!

925
01:18:06,349 --> 01:18:08,059
MORRIS:
Get him!

926
01:18:08,142 --> 01:18:09,310
Damn.

927
01:18:09,394 --> 01:18:10,603
MORRIS:
Kick that motherfucker!

928
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:12,563
Hit the motherfucker! Yeah!

929
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:17,735
Get the fuck out of our house!

930
01:18:17,819 --> 01:18:19,487
-Son of a bitch!
-

931
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:22,365
-MORRIS: Fucker!
-DOLORES: Who’s your mama now?

932
01:18:22,448 --> 01:18:25,910
MORRIS: Welcome to Oak Springs,
motherfucker!

933
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:29,122
-DOLORES: Mr. Big Stuff.

934
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:31,040
MORRIS:
Motherfucker!

935
01:18:31,124 --> 01:18:32,333
Try me! Try me!

936
01:18:32,417 --> 01:18:34,669
Get up! Get up!

937
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:45,054
You think you can beat me?

938
01:18:45,138 --> 01:18:46,681
Oh, no.

939
01:18:46,764 --> 01:18:49,016
The house always wins.

940
01:18:51,102 --> 01:18:52,812
I agree with that.

941
01:18:54,981 --> 01:18:59,777
Welcome to our house, ¡puto!

942
01:19:04,532 --> 01:19:07,869
-

943
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:17,837
-

944
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:32,310
No, no, no, no.
No, not the... not the money.

945
01:19:36,147 --> 01:19:37,773
MR. BIG:
Oh, no. No, no.

946
01:19:37,857 --> 01:19:40,693
-No, no, no, no, no, no!
-

947
01:19:44,071 --> 01:19:46,574
-Caleb!

948
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:51,370
Yolanda. Yolanda.

949
01:19:51,454 --> 01:19:53,247
Lupita.

950
01:20:04,425 --> 01:20:06,344
Game over.

951
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:46,509
MORRIS:
Where’s Clarence?

952
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,594
Clarence!

953
01:20:51,055 --> 01:20:52,515
MR. BIG
The money.

954
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:54,183
Money.

955
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:08,656
Clarence, Clarence, did he...?

956
01:21:11,325 --> 01:21:13,160
No.

957
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:15,997
Clarence.

958
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:34,640
YOLANDA:
So...

959
01:21:36,726 --> 01:21:38,019
What now?

960
01:21:42,732 --> 01:21:45,860
I’m sorry I kept you
all here for so long.

961
01:21:47,361 --> 01:21:51,741
I was too stubborn
to accept the truth,

962
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:54,368
and I should have
listened to you.

963
01:21:55,369 --> 01:21:58,164
This place was never our home.

964
01:21:58,247 --> 01:22:01,459
You are my home, my family.

965
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:04,629
It took all this
for me to see that.

966
01:22:04,712 --> 01:22:06,505
And now...

967
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:08,549
And now what?

968
01:22:08,633 --> 01:22:11,260
We’re not dead yet, woman.

969
01:22:12,845 --> 01:22:14,805
Does that mean
we’re leaving Oak Springs?

970
01:22:15,973 --> 01:22:17,600
I’m just saying. I...

971
01:22:20,394 --> 01:22:24,065
We are Oak Springs, mijo.

972
01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:26,817
And so are you.

973
01:22:28,194 --> 01:22:31,781
So, can Oak Springs go
someplace by the beach, then?

974
01:22:35,534 --> 01:22:37,703
As long as we’re together...

975
01:22:39,163 --> 01:22:41,165
...it doesn’t matter
where we go.

976
01:23:14,949 --> 01:23:19,328
-

977
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:37,012
that I dreamed for

978
01:23:37,096 --> 01:23:40,266
in life’s game

979
01:25:00,012 --> 01:25:03,182
and my loved ones

980
01:25:03,265 --> 01:25:05,100
yeah, I’ll leave
