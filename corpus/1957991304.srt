1
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,800
Constance, you're still here.

2
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,600
I couldn't leave you, Daniel.

3
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,520
He'll wonder where you were.

4
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,920
He doesn't care about me.

5
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,520
He's your husband.

6
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,520
He's your brother.

7
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,560
I have nothing else in my life.

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,480
I can't lose you, Daniel.

9
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,520
What are we?

10
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,440
This is so wrong.

11
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,320
I know.

12
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,960
Can we cut?!

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,880
Cut!

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,800
That's a cut.

15
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,360
Back to first positions.

16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,800
What is this?
His lips?

17
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,040
The lips are fine.
They're fine.

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,320
Could somebody
please mop her down?

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,760
It's not the lips, Harry.
It's my face.

20
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,000
I powdered it, Harry, I swear.

21
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,360
The lights, Harry.

22
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,920
You got a million watts
all focused on my face.

23
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,400
What are you, the lighting
director now, Sydney?

24
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,680
Harry, fix the light.

25
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,840
I'll be in my trailer.

26
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,400
Sydney!

27
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,760
Brenda, call lunch,
will you please?

28
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,400
We already took lunch, Harry.

29
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,920
Then, call dinner, call five,
just get me a tranquilizer.

30
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,040
That's a five, everybody.

31
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,560
Let's not wander
away from the set.

32
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,040
Tell the actors to take five!

33
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,920
Kill the fire!

34
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,600
Give me a playback.

35
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,760
She's killing me, Victor.

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,480
It's the Pinocchio
factor, Harry.

37
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,600
What?

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,760
The Pino-- never mind.
The light?

39
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,640
I checked the bridge.

40
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,920
We were missing a gel.

41
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,200
It was like a floodlight
on Sydney's nose.

42
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,680
What the hell is
the Pinocchio factor?

43
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,800
Her nose, Harry.

44
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,760
She thinks her
knows is too long.

45
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,920
Code word-- Pinocchio factor.

46
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,520
What about pain
in the butt factor?

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,680
You'd have to reshoot
if she hadn't caught it.

48
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,120
Well, fix it.

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,720
Whatever you do, don't let
her know she was right.

50
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,080
Brenda, aspirin, fruit basket
to Sydney's trailer, asap.

51
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,840
Done.

52
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,640
Excuse me.

53
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,560
Excuse me.

54
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,560
Hey, Ms. Clarke!

55
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,520
I'm in Mississippi.

56
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,440
I'm from Mississippi, too.

57
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,480
I know, I know, me, too.

58
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,120
Pushmataha.
- Pushmataha.

59
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,320
Sydney, we have to go inside.
The editor's waiting for us.

60
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,320
Um, I want to talk to you.

61
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,960
Wait, I want to talk to her.

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,320
I know she's from
Mississippi, but she'll

63
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,080
be there when you get out.

64
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,800
OK, now, I'm going
to go find McAndrew.

65
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,400
You wait right here, OK?

66
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,280
Just talked to the
guys from studio.

67
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,840
Yeah?

68
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,560
They're ready to greenlight
the script I wrote for us.

69
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,040
All you have to do is say yes.

70
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,680
I told you, I
don't like the role.

71
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,200
Sweetheart, this is a chance
for us to work together again.

72
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,400
They're willing to
hold up the start

73
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,080
date till after the honeymoon.

74
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,800
Ryan, I've played a psychopath
in two of my last three movies.

75
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,480
He's I'm beginning to worry
what that says about me.

76
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,560
Just read it one more time.

77
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,920
Ryan.

78
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,280
Fine.

79
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,240
Sydney, I found him.
Come on.

80
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,520
Ryan, you stay.

81
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,160
The curator's name
is McAndrew, and I've

82
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,560
just talked him into going
national for this spot.

83
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,240
The art gallery
spot is beautiful.

84
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,920
And here is the wedding
spread the "Puree."

85
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,200
Ugh.

86
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,680
Fran, we don't need
any more publicity.

87
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,680
This wedding is going to
be a media circus as it is.

88
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,200
The event, darling--
the event of the century.

89
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,480
Wish we could just elope.

90
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,720
Elope?

91
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,800
Sydney, you're a star.
You're royalty.

92
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,160
People want to
know every detail,

93
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,280
and we are not going
to disappoint them.

94
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,600
What's the matter, honey?

95
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,480
I don't know.

96
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,840
Maybe just jitters.

97
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,480
But everyone
gets that jitters.

98
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,520
I don't know why we're getting
married in the first place.

99
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,640
You're a great couple.

100
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,040
The press loves you.

101
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,520
Now, Harry says he's
found the perfect location

102
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,200
for the cabin scene,
and there's a four

103
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,800
star hotel right on the lake.

104
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,560
I don't know why we have
to go to location, Fran.

105
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,880
It's a colossal pain.
It's almost May.

106
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,920
There's not going to be any
snow in New England in May.

107
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,400
He's just looking
for authenticity.

108
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,480
That's not so bad.

109
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,360
They're expecting a freak storm.

110
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,440
Yeah, well, they'll get
their freak storm when Harry

111
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,800
gets there, that's for sure.

112
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,200
Oh, stop pouting.

113
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,840
Harry's film means a
shot at a nomination--

114
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,760
Right, Ginger?

115
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,120
Oh, absolutely.

116
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,040
--better parts, better money.

117
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,800
I already got an offer from
the studio at double your fee.

118
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,120
A comedy?

119
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,680
Another psychopath,
but Sydney, who cares?

120
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,600
It's double the money.

121
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,080
Double the money!

122
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,960
And as your best friend,
I advise you to take it.

123
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,120
Oh, how many best friends
do you know get 10%?

124
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,120
All right, as your manager,
I advise you to stay on track.

125
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,200
Just look through these
tonight, so I can at least

126
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,160
get the agents off my back.

127
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,520
Oh, flight at
7:00, limo at 5:00.

128
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,320
And don't worry about
the snow in New England.

129
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,600
You'll have snow
up to your wazoo,

130
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,320
and it will be the real stuff.

131
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,640
Yeah.

132
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,960
Action on the snow!

133
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,360
Action on the camera!

134
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,320
[crying]

135
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,280
Don't cry, mother.

136
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,840
Oh, I can't help it, Miles.

137
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,720
If I don't marry Nathaniel, I--

138
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,840
oops, Daniel.

139
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,800
Cut!

140
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,280
Cut!
Miles!

141
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,160
I didn't screw up.
She did.

142
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,680
Camera, you call
that a dolly movement?

143
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,560
It was pathetic.

144
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,440
OK, cut the machines.

145
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,320
I said turn off
the machines now.

146
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,600
Doesn't look like
a snowstorm, Harry.

147
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,480
It looks like a
dandruff commercial.

148
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,840
Didn't your weather man
call for snow today?

149
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,480
Yes, he did.

150
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,440
He called for it yesterday,
he's calling for it tomorrow.

151
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,880
The guy is a liar.

152
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,360
- We're into overtime, Harry.
- Get me a Valium.

153
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,280
None left.

154
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,240
Is there an aspirin?

155
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,520
- We're out.
- That's it.

156
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,400
Let's wrap.

157
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,600
We're going back to LA.

158
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,720
That's a wrap, people!

159
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,120
Thank you!

160
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,280
Harry, you're
kidding me, right?

161
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,960
Don't start with me, Sydney.

162
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,360
You're flying me 3,500 miles
to wait for snow when we could

163
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,600
have gone 60 miles to Big
Bear or Arrowhead or the 10

164
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,040
other mountains in California.

165
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,520
Now, you want to turn
around and fly back to LA?

166
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,120
I can't make it snow, Sydney.

167
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,440
I'm not god.

168
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,760
Have you ever heard
of snow blowers, Harry?

169
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,080
They make snow, real
snow, not potato chips.

170
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,320
Of course, it's 82 degrees.

171
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,560
We can't make snow
now, can we, Harry?

172
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,920
Give it a rest, Sydney.

173
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,640
We will shoot the snow
after the next location.

174
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,920
You want to shoot the
snow, you do it without me.

175
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,240
Call Glenn Close.

176
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,800
That's who you wanted
in the first place.

177
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,240
Sydney, come back, darling.

178
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,680
Please come back.

179
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,600
Look, try and keep it together.

180
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,760
We'll find the snow.

181
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,600
The writer will make
the adjustments.

182
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,520
It will turn out fine.

183
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,800
It will turn out fine.

184
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,200
What's it, Harry?

185
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,080
Another pointless film
that no one will remember?

186
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,880
Sydney, the public
buys tickets to see you.

187
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,920
We film this, we film that.

188
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,320
In the end, it doesn't matter.

189
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,720
Oh, god, nothing ever matters.

190
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,080
When will it matter?

191
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,280
I keep waiting to see
what that feels like.

192
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,040
Sydney, come back, darling.

193
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,920
Sydney, please come back.

194
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,920
Syd?

195
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,840
Oh, we were rehearsing.

196
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,760
She's your stand-in.

197
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,160
It makes sense, Sydney.

198
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,960
Sydney!

199
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,000
Sydney.

200
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,000
Sydney, your coat.

201
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,440
It's raining.

202
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,560
She's going into the woods.

203
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,160
Should I go after her?

204
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,520
The hotel's 500 yards away.

205
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,160
Let her go.

206
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,040
If we're lucky, there'll be
some big, hairy, hungry thing

207
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,160
in there.

208
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,920
Brenda, do you
not have anything?

209
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,240
Midol?

210
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,040
Sold.

211
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,720
I'm watching it right now.

212
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,480
It's fabulous.

213
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,200
Oh, Quentin, she's perfect.

214
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,120
Fran, it's Harry's office.

215
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,480
I'm busy.

216
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,400
- You should take it.
- I'll call them back.

217
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
Comprende?

218
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,920
Sydney's walked again.

219
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,440
Quentin, I'll call you back.

220
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,480
Harry, how's my
favorite director?

221
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,360
You did what?

222
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,520
Oh, my god.

223
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,880
They've lost Sydney
in the woods.

224
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,880
They sent out a search party.

225
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,160
Harry, are you crazy?

226
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,920
Bigfoot's probably
eaten her by now.

227
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,720
Find her!

228
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,760
Sydney, you're such an idiot.

229
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,240
Idiot, idiot, idiot!

230
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,200
To be or not to be an idiot!

231
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,680
OK, OK.

232
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,680
You can do this.

233
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,120
You can do this.

234
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,080
Oh, oh.

235
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,480
Which way is up, and
which way is down?

236
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,880
Oh, god, I think I'm losing it.

237
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,760
Oh, I don't believe
you did this, Sydney.

238
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,120
You're an idiot.

239
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,840
You walk off a
movie in Manhattan.

240
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,480
Walk off a movie
in Beverly Hills.

241
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,120
You can't walk off a movie in
a god forsaken mountainside

242
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,000
in the middle of nowhere.

243
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,360
Oh, oh, oh.

244
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,760
Wait until the Actors
Guild hears about this.

245
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,720
Oh.

246
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,160
Ooh.

247
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
Oh, oh, oh.

248
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,040
[truck horn honking]

249
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,880
[car sounds]

250
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,720
Oh, hello?

251
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,720
Hello?

252
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,240
Hello!

253
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,720
Hello!

254
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,720
Help!

255
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,200
Hello!

256
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,200
Stop!

257
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,200
Help!

258
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,200
Stop!

259
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,800
Help me, please!

260
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,680
Stop!

261
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,680
Lady with a baby!

262
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,200
Help!

263
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,680
No, wait.

264
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,080
[grunting and screaming]

265
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,080
Oh, oh.

266
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,120
This one's mine!

267
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,600
You take the next one!

268
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,880
Where you headed?

269
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,840
What's the name of that town?

270
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,800
Deerfield?

271
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,920
Deerfield?

272
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,280
Lady, that's back
over the mouth.

273
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,680
I'm headed to Lincoln,
about two hours away.

274
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,120
Take it or leave it.

275
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,960
What, I can't even ride
in the back of the truck?

276
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,240
No honor among
hitchhikers anymore.

277
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,800
Might as well take the damn bus.

278
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,800
What's that over there?

279
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,240
That's the Lincoln steel mill.

280
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,360
We're coming into town now.

281
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,760
Thanks a lot.

282
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,400
Oh, dear.

283
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,760
Mommy, is that a bag lady?

284
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,040
Good morning.

285
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,840
Morning.

286
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,040
He picked up his spare.

287
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,600
Ooh, Joycee, he's on fire.

288
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,880
What's he at?

289
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,440
He's gonna nail a
650 series, for sure.

290
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,320
Who's this?

291
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,960
She could bowl in
our bag lady league.

292
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,560
Answering machine.

293
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,760
It's 4:00 in the morning in LA.

294
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,240
Fran, it's me.

295
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,000
Don't call out the National
Guard, I'm all right.

296
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,160
But don't tell Harry or Ryan.

297
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,560
Tell them that I am
lost and feared dead.

298
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,280
Actually, don't tell--
don't tell Harry that.

299
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,080
He'll get Glenn Close.

300
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,840
I'm coming home.

301
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,160
I've got to, um--

302
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,120
actually, I can't come home.

303
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,480
I need to get money.

304
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,520
You've got to get Fred
to wire me some money.

305
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,840
I'm in, um--

306
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,920
I don't know what the
hell this place is.

307
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,320
I can't read the number
on the telephone.

308
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,560
So I'll call you back.
Never mind.

309
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,400
Bye.

310
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,280
Get the money up front.

311
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,640
Coffee?

312
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,720
- Yes, please.
- Cream and sugar?

313
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,120
Just a little cream.

314
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,920
It's 7:00 in the
morning, who's bowling?

315
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,440
That's the Midnight Humpers
versus the Dawn Patrol.

316
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,720
The Midnight Humpers?

317
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,880
Yeah.

318
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,200
It's the guys coming
off the midnight

319
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,400
shift at the mill
against the guys

320
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,920
coming on the 8 o'clock shift.

321
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,720
They've got an hour
off, and they're bowling?

322
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,720
Are you kidding?

323
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,000
These guys bowl in their sleep.

324
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,200
They bowl for their
wedding receptions.

325
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,200
We've got a bar mitzvah bowl.

326
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,800
I'm in bowl hell.

327
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,640
Can I ask you a question?

328
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,320
Shoot.

329
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,440
What are these weird
things behind me?

330
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,040
You mean the bowlers?

331
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,120
No, I mean the skinny
pins and the tiny balls.

332
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh.

333
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,920
Candlepin.

334
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,400
It's an east coast thing.

335
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,440
It's English.

336
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,240
Can I get you anything else?

337
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,840
A plane ticket out of here.

338
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,160
Did I mention that
I have no money?

339
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,680
The coffee I can
get you on the house,

340
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,120
but you're on your own
for the plane ticket.

341
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,000
Thank you.

342
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,440
You in some kind of trouble?

343
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,600
Now, why would you think that?

344
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,680
You want to talk about it.

345
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,640
No.

346
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,000
OK.

347
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,360
You can use the phone
in the office for free.

348
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,600
I don't know who I'd call.

349
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,480
That's trouble, all right.

350
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,360
Look, um, for starters, how
about I loan you some clothes?

351
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,480
You would loan me clothes?

352
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,080
Why would you loan me clothes?

353
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,280
Because you need them.

354
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,120
Joycee.

355
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,600
Get rid of her.

356
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,040
She's a bag lady.

357
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,520
She's not a bag lady.

358
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,480
She's broke.

359
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,240
She's wearing baggy clothes.

360
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,800
She's a bag lady.

361
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,760
It's a new look.

362
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,640
It's that Elizabethan thing.

363
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,040
OK, we are RSVPed yes to
the Streisand-Lockett party--

364
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,200
Fran.

365
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,440
--no to the
Thanksgiving Day Parade?

366
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,400
Who were they kidding?

367
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,840
Fran, listen--

368
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,080
And a maybe to the Ozone
Replenishment Benefit.

369
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,320
- Fran, Sydney called.
- What?

370
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,760
Yeah, she left a message.

371
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,760
She doesn't know the name
of the town she's in.

372
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,360
She doesn't have any money.

373
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,840
And she didn't know the number
that she was calling from.

374
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,480
But she's going to call back.
- Oh, that's insane.

375
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,040
- So what's new?
- OK, zip it.

376
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,760
Get me Harry on the phone,
and then get me the studio.

377
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,200
No, no, Harry already called.

378
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,440
He knew she was there, was
because some gas station

379
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,560
attendant saw her
with a truck driver.

380
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,720
A truck driver?

381
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,240
For her?
- I'll call the studio.

382
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,040
Yeah.

383
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,960
Anyone ever tell you, you
look like Sandra Bullock?

384
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,160
I don't think I look
anything like Sandra Bullock.

385
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,800
Hmm.

386
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,800
Well, her, or a little bit like
that actress, Sydney Clarke.

387
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,400
Except for the blond hair
and those poofy lips.

388
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,000
She had them injected
with sheep fat, you know?

389
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,480
Oh, she did not.

390
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,960
I read it in a magazine.

391
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,160
It's true.

392
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,320
So what is your name?

393
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,640
Uh, Cheryl.

394
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,760
Cheryl Belson.

395
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,920
Well, it's nice
to meet you, Cheryl.

396
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,800
I'm Joyce McMurphy.

397
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,800
You, too.

398
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,480
Cheryl, promise me one thing.

399
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,880
What?

400
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,920
That one day you'll
tell me about that dress,

401
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,000
and the last couple of days.

402
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,760
It's a long story, but I will.

403
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,640
WALTER: I don't know what
you're doing in there, Joycee,

404
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,560
but we're backed up out here!

405
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,400
Come on.

406
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,920
Only cook it once, kiddo.

407
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,080
I know, I know.

408
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,080
All cooks are the same.

409
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,160
A persnickety group of people.

410
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,160
Cheryl, hold your arm up.

411
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,160
Palms up.

412
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,280
Thank you.

413
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,640
Well, what--
what are you doing?

414
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,800
Do me a favor, run
this down to lane three.

415
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,680
Me?

416
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,800
Oh, I don't think so.

417
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,160
What's your problem?

418
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,400
You're asking
me to wait tables?

419
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,360
No, I'm asking you
to do me a favor.

420
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,080
How's a person supposed
to carry all this?

421
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,200
Haven't you ever
heard of a tray?

422
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,880
Yeah, sure.

423
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,680
There you go.
- OK.

424
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,920
Go, lane three.

425
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,240
Lose the attitude,
you might get a tip.

426
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,800
Yes!

427
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,200
Ha ha, see ya later.

428
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,680
See ya later, buddy.

429
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,600
Can somebody give
me a hand, please?

430
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,040
Save my drink!
Save my--

431
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,000
Hang on, we got them.

432
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,920
We got them.

433
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,880
Oh, thank you.

434
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,880
How much we owe you?

435
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,760
I don't know.

436
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,360
I'm not a waitress.

437
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,360
Well, that's apparent.

438
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,360
Hey, Joyce!

439
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,280
How much?

440
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,120
Uh, $10.50.

441
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,760
Ten, fifty.

442
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,920
Ah, the Bill Gates of bowling.

443
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,200
Tipping is not a city
in China, you know?

444
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,160
That's good.

445
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,400
Thank you, Peaches.

446
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,280
Cheryl, and I'm
leaving tomorrow.

447
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,680
- I wasn't asking.
- Yes, you were.

448
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,080
What's your hurry?

449
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,400
Hard to make a living here.

450
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,000
You're telling me.

451
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,400
Maybe you're in the
wrong line of work.

452
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,280
You got that right.

453
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,520
So stick around anyway.

454
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,600
Now, why would
I want to do that?

455
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,640
Because I'm here.

456
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,520
That's why I'm leaving.

457
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
Youch!

458
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,400
Chewed him up and spit him out.

459
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,400
That hurt.

460
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,520
Total annihilation, brother.

461
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,480
Yeah, you want
to know something?

462
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,480
She really likes me.

463
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,400
Yeah.

464
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,200
Oh, yeah.

465
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,520
Lot of houses for sale.

466
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,960
Well, people are scared.

467
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,160
Every time there's another
rumor about the mill

468
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,600
closing, somebody leaves

469
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,960
- Lock up, will you, Joycee?
- Sure, no problem.

470
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,640
Good night, Walter.
- Thanks.

471
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,160
You don't mind if I hang here
until the rain stops, do you?

472
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,480
No, not at all.

473
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,280
Um, but can you give
me a hand, or are you

474
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,800
going to stand there
like the Queen of England

475
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,040
and watch me drop this stuff?
- Sure.

476
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,800
What do you need me to do.

477
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,080
I'm just kidding ya.

478
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,720
Here, take this,
push A1 on the jukebox.

479
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,160
Ooh, I can handle that.

480
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,400
Good.

481
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,040
So where are you from, Cheryl.

482
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,040
Mississippi.

483
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,040
Pushmataha.

484
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,680
I thought I heard an accent.

485
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,960
How did you wind up here?

486
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,040
Sort of walked off a job.

487
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,920
That's a hell of a long walk.
[music from jukebox]

488
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,800
Oh!

489
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,280
I used to love this song!

490
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,920
Yeah, me, too.

491
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,640
Every time we heard this song,
we had to jitterbug to this.

492
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,120
- Oh, yeah?
- Ooh, come dance with me.

493
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,200
- Cut it out.
- Oh, come on.

494
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,320
Put that down.

495
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,440
Whoo!

496
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,800
I don't do this very well.

497
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:03,280
BOTH: [singing] I'll always
love you, always love you.

498
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,360
- Get ready now.
- What?

499
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,240
Whoo!

500
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,160
Ah!

501
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,160
[crashing sounds]

502
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,680
I'll get my crutches.

503
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,960
Hang on!

504
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,120
Wait, wait, wait,
don't move without me.

505
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,880
- I'm fine.
- Just a second.

506
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,280
I'm fine.
Ow!

507
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,280
- Oh, Joyce, I'm so sorry.
- It's OK.

508
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
I just bumped it.
- Are you OK?

509
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,360
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

510
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,200
Just grab my bag.
Thank you.

511
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,160
All right, take it easy.

512
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,040
Slow!

513
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,040
Joyce, wait a second.

514
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,400
I've got it.
I've got it.

515
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,760
Have you got it?

516
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,880
I can't remember when
I've had so much fun.

517
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,120
I'm so sorry.

518
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,520
If you say you're
sorry one more time,

519
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,960
I will whack you, OK?

520
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,200
Easy.

521
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,720
So where you going
to stay tonight?

522
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,200
I haven't figured
that out yet.

523
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,720
Well, you're welcome
to stay on my couch.

524
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,080
Joyce, you're
such a nice person.

525
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,400
I don't know what to make of it.

526
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,400
Are you sure you're
not southern?

527
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,560
If that means thank
you, you're welcome.

528
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,480
Door's unlocked.

529
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,600
No, we don't lock it.

530
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,920
Oh, small town.

531
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,720
I love it.

532
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,560
How do you feel?

533
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,400
I'll live.

534
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,200
Can I see that?
- Sure.

535
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,040
Thanks.

536
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,800
That is so good.

537
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,160
Thank you.

538
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,560
Is that what you do
back in Pushmahooha?

539
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,360
Pushmataha.

540
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,480
No.

541
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,280
Worked at a tropical fish store.

542
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,440
That's the job
you walked out on?

543
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,160
The guppies got to you, huh?

544
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,560
No, the piranhas, not to
mention a cheating fiance.

545
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,760
Ouch.

546
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,400
So now what'll you do?

547
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,360
I mean, what would you like
to do if you had your choice?

548
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,480
Ooh, what a question.

549
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,000
If I could do anything,
what would I do?

550
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,560
36 years old, and I don't
know the answer to that.

551
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,200
Can I give you
a little advice?

552
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,800
Sure.

553
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,160
I don't think you're quite
cut out to wait tables.

554
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,600
No kidding.

555
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,080
I like my food brought to
me, thank you very much.

556
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,600
What about you?

557
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,080
You gonna hang out with
the Midnight Humpers

558
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,080
the rest of your life?
- No, actually.

559
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,640
Someday I'd like to open up a
little cafe down by the lake,

560
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,200
own my own business.

561
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,480
What a wonderful idea.

562
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,200
Why don't you do that?

563
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,520
Risky.

564
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,160
Mill closes down, so
does everything else.

565
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,520
Well, risks are meant
to be taken, right?

566
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,640
Well, one step at
a time, if I'm lucky.

567
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,400
First, I gotta figure
out how to wait

568
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,760
tables walking on my hands.

569
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,200
I gotta figure out how to
get out of here, no offense.

570
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,480
Where is the
nearest big airport?

571
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,040
Boston.

572
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,920
OK, I have friends in Boston.

573
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,840
How do I get to Boston?

574
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,760
Do I take a train, bus?

575
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,680
What?

576
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,040
We got a train station.

577
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,560
Train leaves tonight, I
think around 8 o'clock.

578
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,120
Oh, I just have
one little problem.

579
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,920
Oh.

580
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,680
Joyce, I don't know
how to thank you.

581
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,640
Would you stop it?

582
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,360
Just keep it.

583
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,760
I practically
break your foot off,

584
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,440
and you lend me a
week's worth of tips.

585
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,600
Cheryl, the way I was
raised, somebody needs

586
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,600
help, you give it to them.

587
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,600
You'll pay me back.

588
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,760
You've got my address.
- Sure.

589
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,120
Thank you.

590
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,560
I'll get your clothes
back to you right away.

591
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,760
Promise.

592
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,240
Did I mention the
interest payments?

593
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,680
I gotta get back to work.

594
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,960
Thank you so much.

595
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,680
I'll be in touch.

596
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,760
You take care.

597
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,280
Yeah, you, too.

598
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,160
See ya.

599
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,000
Bye.

600
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,640
This train should
be here any minute.

601
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,200
Where you heading?

602
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,640
Not me.

603
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,600
My daughter's coming home.

604
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,920
Oh, that's nice.

605
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,680
Yeah.

606
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,080
Yeah, she's 33 now.

607
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,680
I haven't seen her
for almost four years.

608
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,520
Nothing's better
than coming home.

609
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,160
She must have
traveled a lot, huh?

610
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,280
Oh, there's been
a place or two.

611
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:32,640
Greece, the island of
Crete, Italy, Switzerland.

612
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,520
Well, most of Europe, really.

613
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,680
England, as far up as Norway.

614
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,200
Oh, that's not counting the
Arctics, both up and down.

615
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,080
It sounds adventurous.

616
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,880
She went everywhere.

617
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,000
But the best place is home,
where people love you,

618
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,040
where they care about you.

619
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,000
Well, she's home.

620
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,760
Enjoy the visit.

621
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,120
Oh, my god.

622
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,760
Otis and Kirby, order's up!

623
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,080
Come get it!

624
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,920
There you go.

625
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,360
Tell you what, Kirby.

626
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,320
I'll carry yours,
you carry mine.

627
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,800
That way, it'll still feel
like someone brung it to us.

628
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,640
Good idea.

629
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,160
Very funny, boys.

630
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,640
Two Stooges of bowling.

631
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,480
She's back.

632
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,440
Fran, you're never there.

633
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,520
It's Sydney.

634
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,560
Listen, I'm not going
to come back right away.

635
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,720
I gotta-- I gotta--

636
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,720
I don't know what I gotta do.

637
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,840
Something.

638
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,000
I'll-- I'll call
you in a few days.

639
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,840
Bye.

640
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,680
Hey.

641
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,000
Hey.

642
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,200
You all right?

643
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,960
I don't know.

644
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,120
I thought you were going home.

645
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,680
Right now, here seems
better than there.

646
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,520
OK.

647
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,400
Well, what are we going
to do with you, then?

648
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,040
Besides fish food,
what have you done?

649
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,840
What have I done?

650
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,040
You mean work?

651
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,360
Yeah, work.

652
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,520
I think we've exhausted
the waitress thing.

653
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,400
Yeah.

654
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,840
Well, I've-- I've
done a lot of things.

655
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,440
When I was a teenager,
I flipped burgers.

656
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,600
Mm-hmm.

657
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,200
I was a nurse's
aid once, sort of.

658
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,920
That's how you knew
to put ice on my foot.

659
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,200
Yeah.

660
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,440
I tell you what, my
friend, Darlene, is

661
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,680
the nurse at the
mill, and she is dying

662
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,360
to visit her sister in Florida.

663
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,680
Oh, I don't know.

664
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,880
You could cover for
her during her vacation.

665
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,080
The pay's pretty good.

666
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,120
I can't do that.

667
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,480
Just till she gets back.

668
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,000
Look, it'll put
money in your pocket,

669
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,120
get your confidence back.

670
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,840
I'm going to set
it up right now.

671
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,120
All you gotta do is
turn on the boss.

672
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,280
Gonna get along great.

673
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,480
I know we have to
make this shipment,

674
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,320
but I can't speed it up
without slacking on safety,

675
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,480
and I'm not going to do that.

676
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,040
Mr. Cameron?

677
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,880
Peaches.

678
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,960
Well, I thought you
were leaving town.

679
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,520
- You're the boss?
- Yeah.

680
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,600
Ben, remember?

681
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,520
Yeah.

682
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,200
Wow, a waitress, now a nurse.

683
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,440
If this keeps up, you'll be
mayor by the end of the week.

684
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,720
Huh, Belson.

685
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,120
Mississippi.

686
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,360
Pushma--

687
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,080
Pushmataha.

688
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,920
You know, I never actually met
anyone from Mississippi before.

689
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,160
Yeah?

690
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,360
Well, most of us are
wearing shoes now.

691
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,640
We got indoor plumbing, too.

692
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,760
You look very familiar.

693
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,840
Huh.

694
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,440
Let's see.

695
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,400
Work history.

696
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,360
Sold tropical fish supplies.

697
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,200
Gourmet chef.

698
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,640
Part time nurse.

699
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,520
Well, actually, it was
more like a nurse's aide.

700
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,400
Well, how are
you with splinters?

701
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,360
That's about as serious
as it gets around here.

702
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,280
Of course, there was that
one time that Guy Helier got

703
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,760
decapitated with
a hydraulic drill.

704
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,360
You're kidding, right?

705
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,040
Yeah.

706
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,120
Very funny.

707
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,160
Steel mill humor?

708
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,120
You're hired.

709
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,040
Just like that?

710
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,480
Steel mill intuition.

711
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:59,240
You got a certain big
city something about you.

712
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,600
But not entirely.

713
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,160
I like it.

714
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,840
I thought you were leaving town.

715
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,040
I thought so, too.

716
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,240
Well, lucky for us.

717
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,360
Come on, Peaches,
I'll show you around.

718
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,720
The mill has six divisions,
deploying over 1,000 men.

719
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,240
This division makes
steel products,

720
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,480
bridges, stuff like that.

721
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,000
Mm-hmm.

722
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,840
My grandfather helped
build this place in the '20s.

723
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,280
- Did he really?
- Yeah.

724
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,680
The town was really
prosperous then.

725
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,520
Well, it seems
busy enough now.

726
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,200
Well, what you're
seeing are guys

727
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,440
working double shifts in order
to keep the mill in the black.

728
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,000
It's what everybody
has to do these days

729
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,720
to compete with foreign steel.

730
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,080
The nurse's station and the
lunch room are up there.

731
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,040
Dick, this is Cheryl Belson.

732
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,360
She'll be taking over for
Darlene until she comes back.

733
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,680
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

734
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,840
Very nice to meet you.

735
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,440
Welcome.

736
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,840
- Can you give us a second?
- Oh, sure.

737
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,760
No problem.

738
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,480
Thank you.

739
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,760
Ben, did you, uh-- did you send
in that report to New York yet?

740
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,560
No, I was hoping the output
would improve this week,

741
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,000
so I can send something
more optimistic.

742
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,440
Why?
- Good.

743
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,920
Because I wanted to go to
the accounts receivable

744
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,560
and see if I can shake loose
a few dollars from some

745
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,640
of these guys that owe to us,
you know, and tip the numbers

746
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,640
in our favor a little bit?

747
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,840
- OK.
- Good.

748
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,720
Great.

749
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,520
Hey, Dick, everything OK?

750
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,440
I just got a call.

751
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,840
Elaine fell again.

752
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,760
That's my wife.

753
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,040
She's been pretty sick.

754
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,880
- Is she all right?
- Well, nothing's broke.

755
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,200
But I can't say she's OK.

756
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,000
It's been a pretty tough
go for the last two years.

757
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,600
She's getting tired.

758
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,640
Well, what are you doing here?

759
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,560
Go be with her.

760
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,720
Oh, I can't do that.

761
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,960
You know what's on my desk.

762
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,400
Look, If I need
you, I'll call you.

763
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,560
Go ahead.

764
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,240
Go!

765
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,080
Thanks, Ben.

766
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,880
That was a nice thing to do.

767
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,480
Well, I'm a nice guy.

768
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,240
A lot of people I know
who wouldn't have done that.

769
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,240
It sounds like you're hanging
out with the wrong crowd.

770
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,080
Here's your office.

771
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,680
What do you think?

772
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,480
Looks like home to me.

773
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,720
SYDNEY CLARKE [ON
ANSWERING MACHINE]:

774
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,720
I don't know what I got to do.

775
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,640
Something.

776
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,840
I'll call you in a few days.

777
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,400
Bye.

778
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,880
In a few days.

779
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,480
Get me the studio.

780
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,880
Executives are going to be
hemorrhaging all over the lot.

781
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,840
Ryan's on two, and
your mom's still on hold.

782
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,640
Mom, hold on.
Ryan?

783
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,600
Oh, of course, she's coming.

784
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,120
I talked to Sydney this morning.

785
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,560
Everything will be fine.

786
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,720
You, too.

787
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,560
Kiss, kiss.

788
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,440
I don't see any
splinters, Otis.

789
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,280
I don't know,
I felt something.

790
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,080
A metal filing, maybe?

791
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:44,920
Let me get some aspirin.

792
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,040
You can go back to work now.

793
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,320
Well, what about checking
out that splinter in my butt?

794
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,600
Sit on a mirror and
check it yourself.

795
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,880
Sit on a mirror the
check it yourself?

796
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,920
What kind of nurse is that?

797
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,600
Yeah!

798
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,880
Ow.

799
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,720
Come on in.

800
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,720
Hey.

801
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,480
You think about my idea?

802
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,960
Ben, it doesn't work.

803
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,280
Guys doing these jobs, they
don't make enough money

804
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,640
to buy back the plant.

805
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,960
Hey, John, I need that
mig gun by tomorrow!

806
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,160
Where do you come up with
these Wall Street strategies?

807
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,840
Well, we got to do something.

808
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,400
Relax, brother, they've been
threatening to close this place

809
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,680
down since we were kids.

810
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,360
Yeah, well, this
time it might happen.

811
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,400
Look, just because they shut
down Ithaca doesn't mean we're

812
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,880
going down, too.

813
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,360
Hey, you saved New Bedford,
you'll save us as well.

814
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,520
Stop worrying.

815
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,400
Yeah.

816
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,880
Hey, Ben, hit me long.

817
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,320
Nice hands, Jimmy!

818
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,120
Nice arm.

819
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,080
You must have played.

820
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,640
What, in college?

821
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,840
A little bit.

822
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,640
Where did he play?

823
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,680
As a nurse, what would
you prescribe for him?

824
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,480
Stick to bowling.

825
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,160
So uh, how is your
first day going so far?

826
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,280
Lot of aches and
pains, twisted ankle.

827
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,800
Drew the line at
checking for hernias.

828
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,120
Smart.

829
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,560
So what are you going
to do to celebrate?

830
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,440
Celebrate?

831
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,800
Yeah, you got a new job.

832
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,160
A person gets a new job,
they ought to celebrate.

833
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,960
I don't have anything
planned, really.

834
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,560
Well, in that case, how
about dinner at my house?

835
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,440
You don't quit, do you?

836
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,320
Well, I haven't
heard you say no.

837
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,480
And if I did?

838
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,840
I'd be perfectly fine with it.

839
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,720
Nah, I don't think so.

840
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,600
Come on!

841
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,080
You just got a new job!

842
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,200
Ah, it's very sweet of
you, I just don't think so.

843
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,840
Oh, how do you say
I don't think so.

844
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,760
It's impossible.

845
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,440
Just say yes.

846
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,640
Come on, just yes.

847
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,160
A simple yes.
What else you gonna do?

848
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,240
Who do-- what else you gonna do?

849
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,880
Who do you know in town?

850
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,800
OK.

851
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,480
All right, already.

852
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,320
As long as I don't have to carry
more than one plate at a time.

853
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,000
Actually, I was
hoping you'd cook.

854
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,360
I have to cook?

855
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,880
Well, your resume says
you're a gourmet chef.

856
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,000
Besides, I got a couple of
trout I caught yesterday.

857
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,680
It needs a little loving
hand, a little imagination,

858
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,440
culinary skill.

859
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,400
Where do you live?

860
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,560
I'm staying at Joyce's.

861
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,480
Really?

862
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,080
Well, uh, I'll pick
you up at 7:00.

863
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,000
OK.

864
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,080
See ya at 7:00.

865
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:23,880
Great.

866
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,160
I just don't understand how
you could tell him you were

867
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,760
a chef when you really weren't.

868
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,080
Well, I wasn't lying.

869
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,920
I just didn't stick
with it for very long.

870
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,920
Oh.

871
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,080
You like him, don't you?

872
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,880
Maybe.

873
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,560
You want to try
this-- ravishing red?

874
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,880
Sure, I guess.

875
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,160
I mean, I've never
done them before.

876
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,000
You've never done
your nails before?

877
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,040
In this color.

878
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,440
Oh.

879
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,840
Hey, this one might work--

880
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,960
flambe the trout.

881
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Simplemente to flambe.

882
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,560
Ooh-la-la.

883
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,320
And for your nails, I have
the perfect color sweater.

884
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,800
[doorbell ringing]

885
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,200
Oh, that's probably Carter.

886
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,760
Here you go.

887
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,680
Hi.

888
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,680
Hi.

889
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,760
- How are you?
- Good.

890
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,640
How are you?

891
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,560
I'm OK.

892
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,760
Ah, the boyfriend.

893
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,240
Carter, this is Cheryl Belson.

894
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,880
She's visiting from
somewhere in Mississippi.

895
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,760
This is Carter.

896
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,200
Yes, the boyfriend.

897
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,600
It's so nice to
meet you, Carter.

898
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,080
Likewise.

899
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,360
She is a bit like
Sidney Clarke, but, uh,

900
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,480
Sydney is a little more zaftig.

901
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,560
Zaftig?

902
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,000
It means chunky.

903
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,720
I know what it means.

904
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,960
Carter's the director
of our community theater.

905
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,200
Oh, how nice.

906
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,800
Mmm, I'm holding
auditions next week,

907
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,480
"A Midsummer Night's Dream."

908
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,680
Why don't you pop along?

909
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,320
We'll see if we can fit you in?

910
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,320
Oh, I don't know.

911
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,600
I'm not much of an actress.

912
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,200
Neither is Sydney Clarke.

913
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,520
Never stopped her.

914
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,920
I'll be there.

915
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,560
I'm going to
audition, too, and maybe

916
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,320
this year I'll get something.

917
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,240
We'll see you later, Cheryl.

918
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,080
Don't wait up.

919
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,400
I'm very impressed.

920
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,400
You should be.

921
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,960
It's a highly skilled operation.

922
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,360
I just can't tell whether
you know what you're doing,

923
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,000
or you're the best con
artist I've ever seen.

924
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,920
If the con is done
well enough, who's to say

925
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,040
it isn't the truth?

926
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,280
And what if you
don't pull it off?

927
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,360
The spell was broken.

928
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,080
We're having a conversation,
and I don't know what

929
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,480
the hell we're talking about.

930
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,160
You're driving me crazy.

931
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,440
I have to check the trout.

932
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,920
No, wait, the trout is fine.

933
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,320
I have never seen such
beautiful brown eyes in my life.

934
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,720
On me, or the trout?

935
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,160
Speaking of the
trout, watch out.

936
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,280
All right.

937
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,600
Ooh-la-la.

938
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,000
All right, very good.

939
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,560
Hey, a bit of cognac.

940
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,080
For medicinal purposes?

941
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,080
And voila!

942
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,400
Oh, here we go.

943
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,440
[coughing]

944
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,280
Oh!

945
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,000
Is this what's
supposed to happen?

946
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,000
Oh!

947
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,560
Oh, yeah, that's much better.

948
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,880
You are the worst.

949
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,680
What, you never
had a smoked trout?

950
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,320
Oh, my god.

951
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,600
You OK?

952
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,520
I'm fine.

953
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,520
Really.

954
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,480
A little humiliated, but fine.

955
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,200
I'm sorry about the trout.

956
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,960
I know you two were just
starting to hit it off.

957
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I just feel lucky we're alive.

958
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,960
I still have my home.

959
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,680
Not worried about the trout.

960
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,040
You like fudge?

961
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,520
Love fudge.

962
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,800
Do you have fudge?

963
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,080
Do I have fudge?

964
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,600
I made this.

965
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,960
It happens to be the only
thing I know how to cook.

966
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,280
Is it good?

967
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,440
Well, it beats the
hell out of your trout.

968
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,840
Wouldn't be hard.

969
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,200
Mm-hmm.

970
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,160
Your fish tank's not healthy.

971
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,680
- Really?
- Yep.

972
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,120
Bringing up the fish tank
at this particular moment

973
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,960
is, uh, slightly frustrating.

974
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,200
Well, I think we
hardly know each other,

975
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,520
and I don't fool around
on the first date.

976
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,200
Well, it's early.

977
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,160
Come on, let's have
our second date.

978
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,960
Come on.

979
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,000
You really love
this town, don't you?

980
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,120
Well, I grew up here.

981
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,800
There's four generations
of Camerons buried here.

982
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,120
My mother and father
are right over there.

983
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,920
You loved them, too, huh?

984
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,840
My parents?

985
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,800
Yeah, well, they
were my parents.

986
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,920
What, you don't have warm
feelings about Pushmata--

987
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,800
hari?

988
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,200
Pushmataha.

989
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,920
Would you guys give me a break?

990
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,800
Just because you live
in cliche-ville Lincoln.

991
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,960
Jeez.

992
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,600
Pushmawhatchacallit
was wonderful.

993
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,160
I loved it.

994
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,920
I can't say the same thing
about my father, unfortunately.

995
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,840
He left when I was nine.

996
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,440
Hmm, I guess I lived
the American dream.

997
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,320
You know what's
great about you, Ben?

998
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,600
Yeah.

999
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,280
My broad shoulders
and irresistible grin?

1000
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,800
No.

1001
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,360
You are who you are.

1002
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,040
Rock solid, genuine,
straight forward.

1003
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,080
That sounds so boring.

1004
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,800
You know what I like about you?

1005
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,240
It's just the opposite.

1006
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,360
See, I-- I look at you
and I see something more.

1007
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,360
I know there's something more.

1008
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,400
You got me curious.

1009
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,120
Is that something new for you,
a woman who makes you curious?

1010
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,120
Well, maybe there was one or
two when I lived in New York.

1011
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,240
You lived in New York?

1012
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,120
Yeah.

1013
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,080
You surprised?

1014
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,160
Yeah, I am a little.

1015
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,040
You didn't like the big city?

1016
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,320
No, it was all right.

1017
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,800
I just moved back
when I had the chance.

1018
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,440
Never really felt
right anywhere else.

1019
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,280
Whoa, do you see
that falling star?

1020
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,800
Oh, yeah, you don't
see those too often.

1021
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,040
Where I come from, you
see them all the time.

1022
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,360
You cold?

1023
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,560
Yeah, I am a little bit.

1024
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,880
Thank you.

1025
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,840
So uh, what's your
policy on third dates?

1026
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,760
Hi.

1027
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,200
Two, please.

1028
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,600
Enjoy the show.

1029
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,280
Yep.

1030
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,800
You want anything to eat?

1031
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,800
No, I'm OK right now.

1032
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,640
OK.

1033
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,400
Let's sit up on the stage.

1034
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,280
No, I like to sit
right in the middle.

1035
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,360
Right here.

1036
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,320
Wow, such a control freak.

1037
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,160
Ah.

1038
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,320
What are you so happy about?

1039
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,120
Oh, I love this.

1040
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,440
It's just a movie theater.

1041
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,360
Ordinary and wonderful.

1042
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,560
Oh, well, you
know, if it makes

1043
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,640
you so happy going
to the movies,

1044
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,480
we should do it more often.

1045
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,480
I think this date is
going really well.

1046
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,640
I'm having fun.
So am I.

1047
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,840
NARRATOR [ON FILM]:
Now, in the role

1048
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,960
you've been waiting
for her to play--

1049
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,280
Frankly, I need some help.

1050
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,480
NARRATOR [ON FILM]:
--Sydney Clarke.

1051
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,600
I need someone
who knows the game,

1052
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,040
and can point the way for me.

1053
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,920
NARRATOR [ON FILM]: Sydney
Clarke, more beautiful

1054
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,800
and more dangerous than ever.

1055
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,000
SYDNEY CLARKE, AS CHERYL
BELSON [VOICEOVER]: If the con

1056
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,320
is done well enough--
- Oh, my god.

1057
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,440
SYDNEY CLARKE, AS CHERYL
BELSON [VOICEOVER]:

1058
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,680
--who's to say it
isn't the truth?

1059
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,960
I could use a real
friend right now.

1060
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,800
And I know that I
can't just ask you to--

1061
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,080
You're--

1062
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,680
--drop everything
and run up here, but.

1063
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,120
NARRATOR [ON FILM]: First,
you see her, then you don't.

1064
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,960
And what happens in
between will have

1065
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,680
you screaming bloody murder.

1066
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,360
Ben.

1067
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,240
NARRATOR [ON FILM]: No matter
how many nightmares you've had,

1068
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,600
you'll never have
ones like this.

1069
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,800
Ben.

1070
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,840
Well, I guess the
joke's on me, huh?

1071
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,040
- Ben, come on.
- Wow.

1072
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,400
Am I going to make
the fan mags now?

1073
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,000
- Let me explain at least.
- No, you got me.

1074
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,920
That was a good one.

1075
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,200
I mean, you really--

1076
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,320
I got to hand it to
you, you really did.

1077
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,320
- It's not like that.
- Really?

1078
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,440
What is it like?
What is it?

1079
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,480
Oh, it's an acting experiment.

1080
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,400
Is that what it is?

1081
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,760
Like, uh, research?

1082
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,200
You know, let's hang out
with the little people?

1083
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,240
That's not what this is about.

1084
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,440
Then, what is it about?

1085
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,000
I just wanted to
know what it felt

1086
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,280
like to be Cheryl Belson again.

1087
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,160
Oh.

1088
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,080
Oh, I see.

1089
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,240
So you, uh, what?

1090
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,720
You show up in some
little hick town

1091
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,080
and look for the
biggest sap in it?

1092
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,480
Is that what it is?

1093
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,440
Thanks for the date.

1094
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,760
Good morning.

1095
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,760
Good morning.

1096
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,240
Oh.

1097
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,160
You don't mind if
I butt in, do you?

1098
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,720
Were you telling me something?

1099
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,240
My time card's gone.

1100
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,680
Yeah, I figured you had
bigger and better things to do.

1101
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,640
OK.

1102
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,120
All right.

1103
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,320
But for the record, I
didn't mean to hurt anyone,

1104
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,440
and I didn't mean to hurt you.

1105
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,640
I was doing my job here.

1106
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,760
I think I was doing it well.

1107
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,640
That was the idea, right?

1108
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,480
One more thing-- actors may
get paid to play emotions,

1109
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,760
but they've got real ones, too.

1110
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,000
Don't slam that door.

1111
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,200
Here you go.

1112
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,400
Wow, that's amazing.

1113
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,960
Listen, I don't think
Joyce is going to be

1114
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,280
back for at least 30 minutes.

1115
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,800
So if you want to
wait, I'll make

1116
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,040
you a grilled cheese sandwich.

1117
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,360
Yeah, I'm not hungry.

1118
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,400
Thank you, though.

1119
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,240
Thank you.

1120
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,400
Good morning.

1121
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,360
Hey, Todd.

1122
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,280
Good morning.

1123
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,680
How ya doing, buddy?

1124
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,760
Ronnie.

1125
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,160
Mark.

1126
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,960
How you guys doing?

1127
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,480
I can see how this is going.

1128
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,400
Good morning, Kevin.

1129
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,040
Maybe I should try
those wussy balls.

1130
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,280
Yeah, maybe you should.

1131
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,520
You waiting for this lane?

1132
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,720
The guys at the
mill want you back.

1133
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,000
There you go.

1134
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,760
I have never had trouble
at the box office.

1135
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,280
Yeah, they're actually
threatening to go

1136
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,800
on strike unless you come back.

1137
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,400
Oh.

1138
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,360
Really?

1139
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,680
I am so flattered.

1140
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,280
Well, they are the
only reason I'm here.

1141
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,040
So what do you say?

1142
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,600
You didn't tell them
who I am, did you?

1143
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,920
How could I?

1144
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,600
How could I tell
them that they're

1145
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,720
laying their jobs on the line
for some Hollywood movie star?

1146
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,400
It's a joke.

1147
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,120
Thank you so much
for stopping by.

1148
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:31,960
Yeah, my pleasure.

1149
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,320
Hey, can I just show you
something for a second?

1150
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,640
Come here.

1151
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,840
Hold the ball like this.

1152
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,080
Now, you want to take
four clean steps,

1153
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,560
and end up with enough room to
slide up to the finish line,

1154
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,360
and end up with your
thumb up by your nose.

1155
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,240
All right?

1156
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,120
Your right thumb.

1157
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,000
OK, go ahead.

1158
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,760
Yeah!

1159
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,960
Ha!
That was really good.

1160
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,840
So what do you say?

1161
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,320
You coming back?

1162
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,720
Who's asking, you or the men?

1163
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,840
What's the difference?

1164
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,600
Tell me the
answer and find out.

1165
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,320
Why is my fish tank so sick?

1166
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,240
You're such a coward.

1167
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,920
I know.

1168
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,840
So Sydney Clarke, huh?

1169
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,120
All right, you happy?

1170
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,080
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1171
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:49,920
Whoo!

1172
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,480
All right, let's get
the worst over first.

1173
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,320
Come on, Otis.

1174
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,080
Yeah, I've already seen these.

1175
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,960
And if we show
these to Remsberg,

1176
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,080
they're definitely
going to shut us down.

1177
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,560
Well, that's why we don't
show those to Remsberg.

1178
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,360
We show Remsberg these.

1179
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,480
What are these?

1180
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,160
Ever since the
Ithaca plant closing,

1181
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,280
I've been inflating the numbers.

1182
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,600
Just enough, you know?

1183
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:27,440
Dick, if-- if they see
these, you'll lose your job.

1184
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,360
Well, if they see these,
we will all lose our jobs.

1185
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,720
You think those guys in New
York care about this town, Ben?

1186
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,560
We're numbers.

1187
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,680
Look, I'm not proud
of this, but I

1188
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,880
got 1,000 guys to worry about.

1189
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,720
Welcome home, pal.

1190
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,120
I don't know, Dick.

1191
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,560
Oh, yeah.

1192
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,240
How long you
been married, Otis?

1193
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,320
Do we have to talk about that?

1194
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,400
I'm just wondering.

1195
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,600
17 long years.

1196
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,040
You love each other?

1197
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,960
Oh-oh-oh.

1198
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,600
I know.

1199
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,160
I haven't figured it out either.

1200
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:15,120
It always starts out so
good, and then ends up awful.

1201
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,280
Men and women, huh?

1202
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,520
What a mix.

1203
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,280
I wouldn't know
where to start.

1204
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,840
Even if I did, I don't
think she'd care.

1205
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,840
Well, I guess life's
a gamble that way, huh?

1206
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,360
I suppose I could try.

1207
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,760
Start out small, bring
her a little something,

1208
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,440
little present maybe.

1209
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,520
I used to do that.

1210
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,400
Yeah?

1211
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,040
Yeah.

1212
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,480
Back in the days when she'd
rub away your aches and pains?

1213
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,400
OK, there you go.

1214
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,440
How's that shoulder now?

1215
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,640
It's better.

1216
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,520
Oh, uh, thank you for, you
know, putting up with me.

1217
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,040
Friends?

1218
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,680
Yeah, as long as you do
the splinter checks yourself.

1219
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,720
I'm gonna have to nominate
her for nurse of the year.

1220
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,360
Hello.

1221
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,280
Hi.

1222
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,560
What's that?

1223
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,560
Special fish food.

1224
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,920
I used to that stuff, remember?

1225
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:15,920
Oh, yeah.

1226
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,840
Come on in.

1227
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,600
Can I ask you a question?

1228
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,960
Yeah.

1229
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,240
What, uh, exactly
brings you to town anyway?

1230
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,880
I was shooting a movie.

1231
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,880
I walked off the set and blah,
blah, blah, I ended up here.

1232
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,320
I'll tell you later,
but your fish need me.

1233
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,640
Mm-hmm.

1234
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,000
They have ich.

1235
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:33,920
Ich?

1236
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,280
Fish disease.

1237
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,760
See, look, you have to
raise the temperature

1238
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,680
and treat the water
every time you change it.

1239
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,080
I brought the medicine, too, so.

1240
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,120
When do we start?

1241
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,000
Now.

1242
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,040
They're suffering.

1243
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,840
I'll show you.
- I meant us.

1244
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,640
Well, you asked me
who I thought I was,

1245
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,560
and I'm looking for an
answer to that, too.

1246
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:02,560
Wish I had something profound
to say, but I got a problem.

1247
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,080
I'm lost without a script.

1248
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:09,920
You asked me when do we
start, and I'm asking you how.

1249
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:16,360
Well, it may be
crazy, but I'd say now.

1250
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,880
And after giving your second
question a considerable amount

1251
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,400
of thought, here's how.

1252
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,720
How happy some o'er
other some can be.

1253
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,320
How happy some o'er
other some can be!

1254
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,760
Through Athens, I am
thought as fair as she.

1255
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,240
But what of that?

1256
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,680
Demetrius thinks not so.

1257
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,160
What a person does for love.

1258
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,440
I can help you with that.

1259
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,720
Oh, I don't think
anybody could help me.

1260
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,560
First, you have to
answer the big question--

1261
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,120
what does Helena want?

1262
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,880
- Want?
- Not just want.

1263
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,600
Want, want, want!

1264
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,360
Because when you're working
on a character in a play,

1265
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,720
you have to know what it is they
want, so that you can want it,

1266
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,080
too.

1267
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,160
Otherwise, the lines you
speak have no meaning.

1268
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,960
So you have to want it so much
that you could just burst.

1269
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,480
Sounds like a lot of work.

1270
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,120
Well, yeah, it is.

1271
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,480
But I'll tell you a secret,
Joyce, everybody in the world

1272
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,840
envies this, knowing
what you want.

1273
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,400
Because they wish
they knew, too.

1274
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,240
That's why they sit in an
audience and watch, why they

1275
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,960
cannot take their eyes off you.

1276
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,400
We're talking
community theater here.

1277
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,040
I love you, Joyce.

1278
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:36,920
Come here.

1279
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,840
I love you.

1280
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:38,680
OK.

1281
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,800
Ay, in the temple, in
the town, in the field.

1282
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,280
You do me mischief.

1283
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,760
Fie, Demetrius!

1284
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:54,040
Your wrongs do set a
scandal upon my sex.

1285
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,840
She's not very good.

1286
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,400
She's had the lead
every year since Carter

1287
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,600
started directing here.

1288
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,960
What about you?

1289
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,360
I have never been cast.

1290
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,560
You're sleeping
with the director

1291
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,000
and you've never been cast?

1292
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:08,840
Please.

1293
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,240
We cannot fight for
love as men may do.

1294
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,080
We should be wooed, and
we're not made to woo.

1295
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:23,000
I'll follow thee and
make a heaven of hell

1296
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,440
to die upon the
hand I love so well.

1297
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,800
CARTER HALE: Wonderful!

1298
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,920
Thank you.
- He loved it.

1299
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,400
Go figure.

1300
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,240
I feel sorry for poor sucker
who has to follow that.

1301
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,000
Uh, Joyce McMurphy.

1302
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,600
Break a leg.

1303
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,440
You prefer to take care of
that, thank you very much.

1304
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,520
And you are?

1305
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,920
Carter.

1306
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,720
Joyce McMurphy.

1307
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,600
Began when ready.

1308
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,240
O, I am out of breath
in this fond chase.

1309
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,440
The more my prayer,
the lesser is my grace.

1310
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,920
Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er
she lies, for she hath--

1311
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,840
Thank you.

1312
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,080
That's very good.

1313
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,000
--blessed and--

1314
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,080
Let her play the first fairy.

1315
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,280
How was I?

1316
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,720
Oh, very convincing.

1317
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,440
I wasn't too la-ti-da?

1318
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,520
Regal, no la-ti-da.

1319
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:50,600
Next, Cheryl Belson.

1320
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,920
OK, big shot.

1321
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,800
You get up there and
don't pee your pants,

1322
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,760
I'll buy you a beer.

1323
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:58,200
Cheryl Belson, are you here?

1324
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,480
Well, listen, buster,
you think I'm afraid

1325
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,760
of a 26-year-old executive?

1326
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,840
Yeah, well, that goes for
28-year-old lawyers, too.

1327
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,200
Well, you're just
going to have to shoot

1328
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,200
around for a couple of days.

1329
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,480
What about reciprocity?

1330
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,960
She's had three hits in a row!

1331
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,320
Oh, they're going to sue
the pantaloons off us.

1332
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:24,880
Sydney, wherever you are, I
hope you're enjoying this!

1333
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,400
I just, uh, need
a moment, please.

1334
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,600
What's here?

1335
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:52,840
A cup, closed around
my true love's hand?

1336
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,800
Poison, I see, hath been
his-- what kind of end?--

1337
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,760
Timeless.

1338
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,880
--timeless end.

1339
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:09,840
O churl, drunk all, and left no
friendly drop to help me after.

1340
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:13,600
I will kiss thy
lips Haply some--

1341
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,600
what?--

1342
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,520
Poison.

1343
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,840
--Haply some poison
yet doth hang on them.

1344
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,920
Thy lips are warm.

1345
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,120
Yea, noise?

1346
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:30,960
Then, I will be brief.

1347
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:37,640
O happy dagger--

1348
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,720
Give me thy sheath.

1349
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,720
--this is thy sheath.

1350
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,880
There rust and let me die.

1351
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,600
I hope she doesn't
give up the day job.

1352
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,200
Thank you.

1353
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,920
That's very good.

1354
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:55,840
Thank you.

1355
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,760
Next!

1356
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,600
Horace!

1357
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,160
Carter looks less
than impressed.

1358
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,600
Well, I thought
you were wonderful.

1359
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,000
- Thank you.
- But he's the pro.

1360
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,720
CARTER HALE: Horace!

1361
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:14,680
Waitressing, no.

1362
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,560
Acting, no.

1363
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,200
Oh, I--

1364
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,800
I didn't quite pee in my pants,
but I owe you a beer anyway.

1365
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,640
Come on.

1366
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,520
Oh.

1367
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,040
Ah, ah!

1368
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,200
Sweeney's down!

1369
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,520
Hey, get over
here, we need help!

1370
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,520
Somebody call the paramedics!

1371
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,920
Get a stretcher!

1372
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:50,960
Cheryl!

1373
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,400
What?

1374
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,920
Sweeney, he's having a
heart attack or something!

1375
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,920
It's no joke!

1376
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,760
Come on!

1377
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,480
Pete, call the paramedics.

1378
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,280
Already did.

1379
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,280
Excuse me.

1380
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,680
Excuse me, excuse me.

1381
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,520
OK, he stopped breathing.

1382
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,680
Hang on, there's no pulse.
Somebody help me.

1383
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,240
What do I do?

1384
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,040
Hands right here, and pump
five times for breath I do.

1385
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,040
Hand me that.

1386
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,600
OK, thank you.

1387
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,440
Ready?

1388
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,360
He's breathing.

1389
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,320
He's breathing.

1390
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,600
Come on, guys!

1391
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,320
Hang on, Sweeney,
here they come.

1392
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,000
He wasn't breathing
and he had no pulse.

1393
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,240
We've now got him breathing.

1394
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,400
All right, I got a good pulse.

1395
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,640
I want the cardiac monitor.

1396
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,560
I'm going to start
an IV right away.

1397
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,480
I'm going to need the
portable oxygen tank.

1398
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,280
No problem.

1399
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,360
Oh, bring me
the nitroglycerin.

1400
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,280
Could

1401
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,280
Is he going to be all right?

1402
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,200
He was a goner.

1403
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,200
Cheryl brought him back.

1404
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,560
His vitals are looking good.

1405
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,720
Advise the hospital we
have a coronary coming.

1406
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,120
Hey.

1407
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,600
Hey.

1408
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,760
You did great.

1409
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,760
I hope he makes it.

1410
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,440
You sure you're OK?

1411
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,520
Yeah.

1412
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,760
Wow.

1413
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,600
There was no mistaking that.

1414
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,520
What?

1415
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,160
Something that mattered.

1416
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,400
I did something that mattered.

1417
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,360
Ooh.

1418
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,160
Sweeney?

1419
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,600
Don't quit on me, Sweeney.

1420
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:12,640
I've got a lot riding on you.

1421
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:16,680
OK?

1422
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,320
I don't think
he's going to die.

1423
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:22,440
It's just not like him to die.

1424
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,720
No, he's a fighter.

1425
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,840
That's what got him here.

1426
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,680
That's what'll get him out.

1427
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,040
I'll tell him you came by.

1428
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,120
I know he'd like that.

1429
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:34,120
And, uh, thank you.

1430
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:34,960
Yeah.

1431
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,240
[doorbell ringing]

1432
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,240
- Come on in.
- Hey, Pete.

1433
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,360
Hey.

1434
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,640
Wow, Cheryl, you
look beautiful.

1435
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,280
Aw, Pete.
Thank you.

1436
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,200
What's she doing with you?

1437
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,960
Yeah, you are beautiful.

1438
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,600
[clearing throat]

1439
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,440
Are you two, having a moment
here, because I could leave?

1440
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,120
That would be great, Pete.

1441
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,480
Yeah.

1442
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,880
Come on, I'll show you
the joys of fatherhood.

1443
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,040
Cheryl, CeeCee's in the kitchen.

1444
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,040
OK, I'll give her a hand.

1445
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,040
Don't cook.

1446
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,520
Whatever you do, do not cook.

1447
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,760
Oh, very funny.

1448
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,640
CeeCee, don't let
her near the stove!

1449
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:13,840
Oh, supper's all ready!

1450
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,720
I don't need any help!

1451
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,320
I can let you stir, that's it.

1452
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:18,640
Oh, give me that.

1453
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,800
Hey, buddy.

1454
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,560
Come on, want to
get a diaper change?

1455
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,560
Yeah, let's go.

1456
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,160
Oh, my god, he's gotten big.

1457
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,760
Yeah, he's getting big.

1458
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,040
Hey.

1459
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,400
CeeCee feeling OK?

1460
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,760
Yeah, she's holding up.

1461
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,200
It's been tough,
though, especially

1462
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:35,800
with me pulling double
shifts three days a week.

1463
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:39,960
Listen, Ben, um, I know
things are tight around town

1464
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:40,960
right now for everybody.

1465
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,880
I don't got to tell you that.

1466
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:46,360
And I don't want to set myself
apart from everybody else.

1467
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,080
But the truth is I just
don't see how CeeCee

1468
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,240
and I are going to make it.

1469
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,760
Listen, Pete--

1470
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:54,280
No, please, Ben, I gotta ask.

1471
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,120
I need a raise.

1472
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:01,160
Well, you're not going
to get a raise, Pete.

1473
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,000
Nobody is.

1474
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,240
Yeah, well, you know,
I just thought I'd ask.

1475
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,480
I owe it to CeeCee and the kids.

1476
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:11,800
I'm sorry.

1477
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:16,080
Look, I got to ask,
if you really had to,

1478
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,480
what else would you do?

1479
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,920
What, you mean not
work at the mill?

1480
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,080
Yeah.

1481
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,480
I don't know.

1482
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,040
You know, it's all
I've ever done.

1483
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,520
You remember when
dad used to say

1484
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:31,440
how steel gets in your
blood, I think he was right.

1485
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,880
Hey, buddy, all done.

1486
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:40,320
There you go.

1487
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,240
You have to use a little
imagination, all right?

1488
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,160
OK.

1489
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,040
I want to show you this.

1490
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,720
Come look right here.

1491
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,480
First of all, you clean up this
whole area here for drinks.

1492
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,880
Come, follow me over here.

1493
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,240
That would be so beautiful.

1494
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,360
You have this porch that
goes all the way around.

1495
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,440
I don't think we
can get in here.

1496
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,480
It's probably locked.

1497
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,760
Ah, it's open.

1498
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,880
Look how charming this is.

1499
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,040
Look at the view people
would have eating.

1500
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:14,120
I hate it when
somebody calls my bluff.

1501
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,080
Well?

1502
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,680
So it would work fine.

1503
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:20,400
A counter over here, deli
case, a few tables and chairs,

1504
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:23,200
near the lake, some
guaranteed business

1505
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:24,680
from the hunters and fishermen.

1506
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:25,600
Well?

1507
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,720
Well what?

1508
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:27,680
Well, what do you think?

1509
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:28,840
I don't know.

1510
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:29,760
I don't know if
I'm ready for this.

1511
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,080
Oh.

1512
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:31,920
What would happen if
it doesn't work out?

1513
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:32,760
But it will work out.

1514
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,440
Easy for you to say.

1515
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,640
I got that feeling again, like
right before I danced with you.

1516
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,840
Oh, well, maybe we'll
just do a waltz next time.

1517
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:53,880
Hey.

1518
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,120
Well, hi.

1519
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,360
Were you going to leave
without saying goodbye?

1520
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,520
No, I was just coming
in to wake you up.

1521
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,640
Where you going?

1522
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,080
Going on a little
business trip.

1523
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:03,960
OK.

1524
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,120
Mm-hmm, no big deal.

1525
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,480
Just something I
gotta take care of,

1526
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,000
and I'll tell you all
about when I get back.

1527
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:08,880
Fair enough.

1528
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,120
Will you feed my fish?

1529
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,120
I'd love to feed your fish.

1530
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,160
In the temple, in the town, in
the field, you do me mischief.

1531
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,520
- I do.
- Fie, Demetrius!

1532
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,840
Your wrongs do set a
scandal upon my sex.

1533
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:29,280
We cannot fight for
love as men may do.

1534
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:32,800
We should be wooed, and
we're not made to woo.

1535
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:37,240
I'll follow thee, and
make a heaven of hell,

1536
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,120
to die upon the
hand I love so well.

1537
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:57,560
O'er hill, o'er dale, o'er
bush, o'er briar, o'er park,

1538
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,440
o'er pale, through a
flood, through a fire,

1539
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,680
I do wander everywhere swifter
than the moon's sphere.

1540
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,520
So good night unto you all.

1541
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:21,240
Give me your hands
if we be friends,

1542
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,320
and Robin shall restore amends.

1543
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,280
Cheryl.

1544
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:12,600
Hey.

1545
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,360
Oh, you were so wonderful.

1546
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,520
Oh, get out.

1547
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:17,760
Oh, you're too much.

1548
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,920
Let's go celebrate,
get a beer.

1549
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:20,880
OK.

1550
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:22,360
Good idea.

1551
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,920
Oh, I should have
used my crutches.

1552
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,120
My foot is killing me.

1553
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,160
Yeah, you weren't
even limping.

1554
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,960
Hey, did you see
Carter anywhere?

1555
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,040
Yeah, I did actually.

1556
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:36,800
Joyce, how well do
you know Carter?

1557
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,200
Pretty well.

1558
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:42,040
How come your face is
saying not well enough?

1559
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,040
Well, when a bad actress
gets the lead role,

1560
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:44,880
don't you wonder?

1561
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,360
Allison?

1562
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,360
Yeah.

1563
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,560
Don't you wonder?

1564
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:55,440
You are really something,
Cheryl Belson from Mississippi.

1565
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:56,720
You sure stir up a pot.

1566
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:57,760
Oh, no, Joyce, I didn't mean--

1567
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,040
Dance up a storm, Joyce.

1568
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,920
Open up that restaurant, Joyce.

1569
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,200
Figure out that Shakespeare,
get up on that stage, Joyce.

1570
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,680
Look at your boyfriend,
see who he is, Joyce.

1571
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:09,560
Know what you want, know
what you really want!

1572
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,840
God, you ask a
lot out of people!

1573
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,720
Joyce, that's not--

1574
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:14,520
ugh.

1575
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,920
Ben, it's been over
a half a year now.

1576
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,040
It only took three
months to make the call

1577
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:27,160
on Ithaca and New Bedford.

1578
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,320
Are you sure you're not
letting a little hometown

1579
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,760
sentiment cloud your vision?

1580
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,720
Richard, I don't know
if it's clouding my vision

1581
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,120
or giving it clarity.

1582
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:38,120
Look, I want to
reinvest in Lincoln.

1583
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,480
Modernize.

1584
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,880
I think if we put enough
money into this plant,

1585
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:43,680
it can turn a
profit in 18 months.

1586
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,720
Why would I want to risk that
kind of financial exposure?

1587
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,560
Because I know the
people who work in Lincoln.

1588
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,640
They are literally giving their
lives to keep this place open.

1589
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,480
I think we should match
that effort with our own,

1590
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,160
give them a fighting chance.

1591
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,080
You close that place,
that town will die.

1592
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,240
And the people will
get severance, extended

1593
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,080
health, job placement programs.

1594
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,120
Ben, it's the numbers.

1595
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,200
No, it's not numbers.

1596
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,480
It's lives.

1597
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,240
It's people's lives,
thousands of people.

1598
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:11,600
Look maybe it was
a little unfair of me

1599
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:14,600
to send you back into your own
home town with this mission,

1600
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,200
but Lincoln's failure
was not my doing.

1601
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,800
Economics is second only
to a force of nature.

1602
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:21,280
My decision to
close that plant is

1603
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:23,040
only a reaction to
something that has

1604
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,640
already happened on its own.

1605
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,360
[phone ringing]

1606

01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,880
Ben, you understood
going in that we

1612
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:51,400
probably were going to have
to close the Lincoln plant.

1613
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,800
Now, accounting is telling
us we have to shut down

1614
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,720
more abruptly than we thought.

1615
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,120
We're rerouting orders.

1616
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,520
As of now, Lincoln is a
liability every moment

1617
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,440
it stays in operation.

1618
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:04,840
Don't disappoint me, Ben.

1619
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,080
Ben, you understood
going in that we

1620
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:16,960
probably were going to have
to close the Lincoln plant.

1621
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,520
Now, accounting is telling
us we have to shut down

1622
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:20,640
more abruptly than we thought.

1623
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,920
[car door shutting]

1624
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,840
[house door being unlocked]

1625
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:37,800
Hey.

1626
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:38,720
Hey.

1627
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,240
This is a surprise

1628
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,240
RICHARD [ON ANSWERING MACHINE]:
Ben, you understood going in

1629
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,640
that we probably
were going to have

1630
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,720
to close the Lincoln plant.

1631
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,440
Now, accounting is telling us
we have to shut down more--

1632
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,240
I asked you to feed the fish,
not to listen to my messages.

1633
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,560
I was not listening
to your messages.

1634
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,440
I was cleaning your
tank, and I happened

1635
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,200
to overhear that message.

1636
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:02,880
Who are you?
- What?

1637
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,240
Are you the prodigal son that
comes back to save the town--

1638
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,680
What are you talking about?

1639
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,160
--and has a secret agenda
held to the last second?

1640
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,520
You know, wait a second.

1641
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:09,640
I don't know how you
could be party to this.

1642
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:10,600
All these people
are your friends,

1643
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:11,400
not to mention your family.

1644
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,360
I know that!

1645
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,880
Don't you think I know that?

1646
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,840
You think this is easy for me?

1647
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,720
I close this place down, that's
1,000 people out of work.

1648
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,080
There are only 6,000
people in this town.

1649
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,320
Well, then, don't do it.
Just quit.

1650
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:21,720
It won't do any good.

1651
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,400
Quit.

1652
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,360
And do what,
express my sympathy

1653
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,400
by living in a ghost town?

1654
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,320
Quit!

1655
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:29,120
You don't know anything!

1656
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,440
You know, you come
here, you think this

1657
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:31,640
is some charming little place!
- Oh.

1658
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:33,080
Fine.

1659
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,200
How charming is it going
to be when everyone in it

1660
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,600
is out of work,
and on food stamps?

1661
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,720
How charming will it be when
you have to hire a steel

1662
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,680
worker as your gardener?

1663
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,520
You know, why don't you
stick your little telethons,

1664
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,640
and you won't get
your hands dirty?

1665
01:08:52,720 --> 01:09:02,160
If that's who you think I am,
then I guess that's who I am.

1666
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,080
I got it.

1667
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,520
Be with you in a sec.

1668
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,080
Joyce.

1669
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:17,880
We got a meat loaf special
tonight. $4.99 with super

1670
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,760
salad.

1671
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:19,680
Joyce.

1672
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,600
Beverage included.

1673
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:22,480
So what'll be?

1674
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,240
I don't have all night.

1675
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:25,560
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1676
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,040
God, I say that a lot.

1677
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:31,320
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1678
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,800
OK.

1679
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:33,800
I need to make a call.

1680
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,160
Do you mind if I use your phone?

1681
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,080
Fran, it's me.

1682
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:15,880
And what was in that
horrible little town

1683
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,120
that you can't find here?

1684
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:18,960
Nothing.

1685
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,840
Fran, I'm going to tell you
something, and then let's

1686
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,440
not talk about it anymore, OK?

1687
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,560
I suppose.

1688
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,680
I caught Ryan
with my stand-in.

1689
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:27,680
Caught?

1690
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:29,000
As in the biblical sense caught?

1691
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,000
That's right.

1692
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:31,240
Well, the guy's a pig anyway.

1693
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,320
You want me to dump him?

1694
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,600
No.

1695
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,800
Is there a guy in Hicksville?

1696
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:38,200
No.

1697
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:40,840
Then, what did you
do for two weeks?

1698
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,520
Got a job at a steel mill.

1699
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,440
You're yanking
my chain, right?

1700
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,040
No, I was a nurse.

1701
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,200
And when I tried out for
a play, didn't get cast.

1702
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,360
We, uh, pushed back
the Vanity Fair shoot,

1703
01:10:55,400 --> 01:11:00,360
but the Albert Brooks film
isn't going to happen for us.

1704
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,320
They went with
Michelle Pfeiffer.

1705
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,760
Ah.

1706
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,160
I said they went
with Michelle Pfeiffer.

1707
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,520
I heard you.

1708
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:12,160
Instead of you.

1709
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,120
I know.

1710
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,000
Don't worry about it.

1711
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:18,880
You know, Sydney,
you might want

1712
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,040
to schedule another
session with that shrink.

1713
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,760
And I probably made the
biggest mistake of my life.

1714
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,320
Boy, this is going
to be a doozie.

1715
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,320
What?

1716
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,760
Oh, never mind.

1717
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,640
[phone ringing]

1718
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,840
BEN CAMERON [ON ANSWERING
MACHINE]: Hi, this is Ben.

1719
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:35,880
Leave a message, and I'll call
you back as soon as I can.

1720
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,960
Thank you.

1721
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,160
RICHARD [ON ANSWERING
MACHINE]: Ben,

1722
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,960
I've left two messages already.

1723
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,240
They say you're not at the
plant, and we need to talk.

1724
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,040
Ben, I repeat, we need to talk.

1725
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,520
No.
Yeah, I understand--

1726
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:02,360
- Sydney!
- --Dick.

1727
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,600
That's what I thought.

1728
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,280
If you could put that
information together for me,

1729
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,640
that would be great.

1730
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,000
I'll call you back.

1731
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,240
You have no idea what
you put us through.

1732
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,640
We've been worried sick.

1733
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:15,000
Yeah, well, I just
needed some time to think.

1734
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:18,200
Don't ever do a thing
like that to us again.

1735
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,400
I want you to promise me that.

1736
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,040
I missed you so much.

1737
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,560
You missed me.

1738
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,040
You kidding?

1739
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,720
It was agony.

1740
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,560
Fran and I are hosting
this party just to show you

1741
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:35,080
happy we are that you're back.

1742
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:40,840
I, uh-- I made some changes I
thought you'd be happy with.

1743
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:44,520
We can look at that later.

1744
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,600
Right now, we have
a wedding to plan,

1745
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:52,280
and this will play in decisions,
and you know me, [inaudible].

1746
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:56,040
Ryan, there's not
going to be a wedding.

1747
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,560
What do you mean?

1748
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,600
This is not easy to say.

1749
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,360
I don't love you.

1750
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,800
Actually, that was
pretty easy to say.

1751
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:06,680
Yeah.

1752
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:10,800
Sydney, our plans.

1753
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:16,040
Oh, this isn't about me
and your stand-in, is it?

1754
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,160
Because that was nothing.

1755
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,880
Sydney, we have a wedding, OK?

1756
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:22,160
There are 1,000 guests.

1757
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,640
Ryan, I don't love you.

1758
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,400
What else can I say?

1759
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:27,960
You mean it?

1760
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:28,800
Yeah.

1761
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:40,600
OK, fine.

1762
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,960
How do you want the publicist to
handle the spin on this thing?

1763
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,080
We'll tell them you dumped me.

1764
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:53,920
We will?

1765
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,120
Great!

1766
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,520
But I guess you won't
be doing my script now?

1767
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,400
We'll see.

1768
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,800
Oh, yeah!

1769
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,880
What was I thinking?

1770
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:06,720
- How did he take it?
- He was crushed.

1771
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,880
What a truly
sensitive human being.

1772
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:16,720
Sydney!

1773
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:17,640
Snappers!

1774
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:18,880
OK, the trades are here.

1775
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,240
They just want to
take a few pictures.

1776
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:22,800
Oh, this is nice.
This is a nice background.

1777
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:26,440
Gentlemen, shoot the star.

1778
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,240
Well, uh, it's
been about six months

1779
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:31,000
since I came back home
to run this place.

1780
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,800
I jumped at the chance.

1781
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,480
I grew up here.

1782
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:39,840
You guys are my friends,
my father's friends.

1783
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:44,800
I knew that, together, we'd
put up a hell of a fight,

1784
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:46,680
because I know what
you're made of.

1785
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:57,680
Well, I haven't been
totally honest with you.

1786
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:02,520
You see, uh, this plant was
slated to be closed down

1787
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,440
long before I ever got here.

1788
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,800
I know that's true,
because it was my job

1789
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,480
to close it, not to run it--

1790
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,880
to shut it down.

1791
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:17,120
I just thought that, uh, if
we had a little more time,

1792
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:21,920
I could straighten
things out, but that's

1793
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,400
not what they pay me for.

1794
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:30,400
You see, New York pays me a lot
of money to shut down plants.

1795
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:33,800
You all did the best you could.

1796
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:41,400
It's not your fault. It's
my fault. I thought I

1797
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,640
could save it, but I couldn't.

1798
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:49,760
And I'm sorry.

1799
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,040
Uh, Dick and I will be getting
to the various departments

1800
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:52,840
about the shutdown.

1801
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,280
That's it.

1802
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,480
You did your best, Ben.

1803
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,960
They'll figure that
out eventually.

1804
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:27,160
Sydney, darling, I'm so
sorry about what happened.

1805
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:28,080
We sent out search parties.

1806
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:29,200
No, no, no, no, it's OK.

1807
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:30,400
I was out of line.

1808
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:31,800
- You're joking with me, right?
- No.

1809
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,160
I'm really sorry.

1810
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,600
Listen, Monday, I have a
very important meeting.

1811
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:35,960
Can we have a later call?
Yes.

1812
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:36,880
We're in the studio.

1813
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,120
Make it a 5 o'clock call.

1814
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,880
I love you.

1815
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:43,280
I'll be on my toes for
the Geppetto factor, Sydney.

1816
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,760
It was the Geppetto
factor, I think.

1817
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,720
Yes.

1818
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,440
It doesn't look
anything like her.

1819
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:49,880
How we supposed to know?

1820
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,560
I'm telling you, she
stood right in my kitchen.

1821
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,880
Yeah, well, she kissed me.

1822
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:55,240
That was artificial
respiration, you idiot.

1823
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,560
You're just jealous.

1824
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:57,760
Of what?

1825
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,360
She pulled a splinter
out of my butt.

1826
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,000
Yeah, well, in Hollywood,
I'll bet that's one thing she'd

1827
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,480
have used her stunt double for.

1828
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:05,120
Yeah, they would have
used a stunt butt for Otis.

1829
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,920
Otis is a stump butt.

1830
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,120
What's that supposed to mean?

1831
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,040
Hey, Ben.

1832
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,720
Get my lawyers and
accountants on the phone.

1833
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,600
I want a meeting this weekend.

1834
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,240
Lawyers, this weekend?

1835
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:20,200
Yeah, this weekend.

1836
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:21,120
Yeah, right.

1837
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:26,200
Dooley's.

1838
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:27,160
Joyce?

1839
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,480
Don't hang up on me.

1840
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,480
I won't hang up on you.

1841
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,400
How are you?

1842
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:34,960
Well, we're knee deep,
to tell you the truth.

1843
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,680
The plant closed down today.

1844
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:37,760
Yeah, I know.

1845
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,840
Damn it, Cheryl--

1846
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:42,200
Sydney, whatever-- why
didn't you just tell me?

1847
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,920
I would have gotten you on
the phone with My mother.

1848
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,600
It would have made her day.

1849
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:48,200
Because I liked Cheryl Belson
better than Sydney Clarke, OK?

1850
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,800
Well, we like them both.

1851
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,640
Who cares if you're famous?

1852
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:55,920
Well, for starters, the
600 people in my living room.

1853
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,960
Is Matt Damon there?

1854
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
As a matter of fact, yes.

1855
01:17:59,040 --> 01:17:59,960
Oh!

1856
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,760
Why didn't you just tell me?

1857
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:02,760
I could have called my sister.

1858
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,760
She's a Sydney Clarke freak.

1859
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,000
OK.

1860
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,400
OK, so I'm the last one to know.

1861
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:09,360
Big deal.

1862
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:10,160
You OK?

1863
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,560
I think I knew about
Carter all along.

1864
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:20,560
I just-- I just didn't
want to believe it.

1865
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,400
We never do.

1866
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,640
Well, it, uh, made me
do a lot of thinking.

1867
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:29,880
About what?

1868
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,480
About want.

1869
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:32,840
No, sorry.

1870
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:33,760
Want!

1871
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,720
Is that better?

1872
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,800
That a girl.

1873
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,880
I've been doing a lot
of thinking myself.

1874
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:40,960
About Ben?

1875
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:41,840
Yeah.

1876
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,320
I messed up, Joyce.

1877
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:47,960
Well, yeah, you know, Ben
kept the plant going a while

1878
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,560
after the death sentence.

1879
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,080
Have you seen him?

1880
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,960
Yeah, I'm looking
at him right now.

1881
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,760
Well, I've got to tell
you, he looks like hell.

1882
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,960
Sydney, Fran says you
have a houseful of guys.

1883
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,600
She'd like you to
come right away.

1884
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:04,720
Joyce, I've got
to go, but I'll

1885
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,120
call you back real soon, OK?

1886
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,080
OK.

1887
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,040
Bye.

1888
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:08,880
Bye.

1889
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:25,880
Ben, you ever wonder why
people sit in an audience?

1890
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,600
Well, I'll tell you why.

1891
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:31,840
Because a character's
got a big want, right?

1892
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,920
You know, like you and me?

1893
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:41,600
So you gotta decide what it
is you want, and how much.

1894
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,080
And that's all I got to say.

1895
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,560
OK?

1896
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,040
OK.

1897
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,040
Did I make any sense at all?

1898
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,040
Yeah.

1899
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:49,840
Good.

1900
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:28,880
Cut!

1901
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:30,760
Sydney, where are you going?

1902
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,520
Aren't you supposed to
be shutting down the mill?

1903
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,920
I quit.

1904
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,760
Big risk.

1905
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,560
It's worth it.

1906
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,040
I'll do anything
for what I want.

1907
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,520
What do you want, Ben?

1908
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:52,320
I want my fish to get better.

1909
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:55,200
I want you.

1910
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:58,640
I want you, too.

1911
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,760
Sydney, we have
a movie to make.

1912
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,000
Do you mind?

1913
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:04,080
If you quit again--

1914
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:05,000
Can't quit, Harry.

1915
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,600
I need the money.

1916
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:08,080
I bought a steel mill.

1917
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:10,240
You what?

1918
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:13,320
Me, and about 20 other people.

1919
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,320
I'm looking for the
right guy to run it.

1920
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:34,680
Cut!

1921
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:08,000
Never thought I'd see that.

1922
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:08,960
We're back!

It's officially yours.

It's heating up.

I've sent you a script.

I want you to read
it over the weekend.

1943

It's a comedy.

It's a comedy.

That's great.

1946
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:43,360
I'll read it right away.
