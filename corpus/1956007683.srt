1
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:22,390
I cannot bear eating alone,

2
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:24,992
even when I was a small boy.

3
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:28,396
You were never a small boy.

4
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:35,669
I knew she wouldn't come.

5
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:37,037
I win the bet.

6
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,507
Name your pleasure.

7
00:01:44,472 --> 00:01:45,873
Your problem is

8
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,476
you try to control women
without understanding them.

9
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,815
Problem? I never found it
a problem.

10
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:20,974
Women know what I want.

11
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,610
They do what I expect.

12
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:24,845
Then where is she?

13
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:35,289
You see? You did exactly what
I expected.

14
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:36,857
And again!

15
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,394
By the way, Karl...

16
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,095
your fly is open.

17
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,281
Hello.

18
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:34,482
Wups.

19
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:38,419
It's your wife, Mr. Hart.

20
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:39,553
Thank you.

21
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:41,322
Hello, sweetheart.

22
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:42,923
Jonathon?

23
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,259
You're not flying the plane
without a copilot again, are you?

24
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:46,760
Safety is my middle name.

25
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,464
Copilot's sitting
right next to me.

26
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,467
Munich is even more
beautiful than I remember.

27
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:54,668
Munich?

28
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,337
Isn't that a coincidence?

29
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:58,272
I'm flying over
Germany right now.

30
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:01,108
Well then maybe you can
come to my party!

31
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,576
You're giving a party?

32
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:06,414
Yes I am! It's my anniversary.

33
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,317
Mine too. What a coincidence.

34
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,118
Who's all invited to this party?

35
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:14,154
Oh, just my closest friends
in Munich.

36
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:17,358
Housekeeping, room service,
the doorman...

37
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:19,560
Save me a seat on your right.

38
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:21,829
I have to be at the Deutsche
Telekom meeting in Berlin,

39
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,665
so I won't be there
till after lunch.

40
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:27,535
Have I told you how proud
I am of what you're doing?

41
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,337
You'd do the same thing.

42
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,639
That's why I married you.

43
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:34,375
Auf wiedersehen, Liebchen.

44
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:36,710
Auf wiedersehen, Schatzi.

45
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,751
I'm crazy about that girl.

46
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,021
Okay, okay.

47
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,223
A deal's a deal.

48
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,859
Paws up.

49
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,366
Not bad.

50
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,968
If you had thumbs,
I'd let you land it.

51
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:12,746
Emergency!

52
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,147
Clear the way, clear the way.

53
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:16,216
Danke. Thank you.

54
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,386
Emergency!

55
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:21,121
Emergency. Doctor, thank
heavens you're here.

56
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,357
Quick, quick, quick!
Stat, stat!

57
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:26,827
Doctor please
to radiology.

58
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,565
Just in time.

59
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,066
For young Maximilian's recovery.

60
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,436
Now, it should hang directly
above his bed.

61
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:38,105
Supervise it for me, will you?

62
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,107
- Peter, I'm a surgeon.
- Yes...

63
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,443
and I am your employer.

64
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,613
I want this in skilled hand.
Please

65
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,015
- Okay, okay.
- Peter.

66
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:54,054
Doctor,
would you please excuse us?

67
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,656
For sure, Simone.

68
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,227
Peter, can't we go somewhere
private?

69
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,329
I need to talk with you.

70
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:11,138
You're having second thoughts
about the wedding, aren't you?

71
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,707
Do you know how I know?

72
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:15,776
I've had second thoughts
about the wedding.

73
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:19,312
Me, the man who's about to
become the luckiest husband

74
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,048
in the world.

75
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,351
Perhaps...

76
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:27,220
- it will happen too fast.
- Not fast enough for me.

77
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,057
If it weren't so right,

78
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,793
neither of us would be nervous. It's
people who don't love each other

79
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,495
who settle for being
comfortable.

80
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:35,863
No sparks,

81
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,231
no doubts.

82
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,634
We'll never feel that way
about each other.

83
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,975
I see my timing is impeccable.

84
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:51,044
I've been looking for you,
Simone.

85
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:54,147
Karl needs to meet with you
about the prenuptial ball.

86
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,184
This is not exactly the right...

87
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,586
time, Elsa.

88
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:00,120
No, this is the perfect
time, darling.

89
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:02,790
I have to go meet the
bone-marrow donor at the hotel.

90
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:05,225
But don't you forget! We're all
going to have dinner later.

91
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,627
I love you.

92
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,112
Karl was very disappointed you
didn't join him for breakfast.

93
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:28,181
Really?

94
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:34,788
Doctor to Emergency.

95
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,977
Lock her in my trunk.

96
00:07:57,044 --> 00:08:01,582
Follow Peters. See where he goes. She may
have told him nothing, but I can't be sure.

97
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:22,803
Mr. Donner.

98
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,937
What?

99
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,441
Peter Donner?

100
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,377
Of the Donner Clinic?

101
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:31,645
Peter Donner?

102
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,647
Oh...

103
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:34,782
Yes!

104
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,451
You are Mrs. Hart?

105
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,087
Jennifer.

106
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,256
Were those for me?

107
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:48,228
Well, they even look pretty
here on the floor.

108
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:49,963
You

109
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,065
are our bone

110
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,934
Yes.

111
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,803
Is everything all right?

112
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,572
Oh, yes, it's...

113
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,975
It's just that you look so
much like someone that I know.

114
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,645
It's my fiancee, as a matter
of fact.

115
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:07,180
Really? Well, I'll take that
as a compliment.

116
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,682
Won't you come in?

117
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:10,918
Is...

118
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,285
you husband here?

119
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:13,954
No, not yet.

120
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,789
It's our anniversary.

121
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:18,525
I was just on my way out to buy him a
present on the Maximilian Strasse.

122
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:21,561
Oh, well since you're my guest
here in Munich,

123
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:24,264
allow me to show you a few
of my favorite stores.

124
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,734
Oh, thank you! That would
be great.

125
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,336
My German's a little rusty.
I could use the help.

126
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,509
I know I wasn't
planning to shop for myself,

127
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,546
but under the circumstances,
who could resist?

128
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:43,116
I know... I know you must think I'm an
idiot, the way I keep staring at you.

129
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,486
How did she get out of Elsa's
trunk?

130
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:48,822
Of course I locked it.

131
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,691
I know how to lock a car trunk.

132
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,329
I've got to call Simone.

133
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,398
The resemblance is too uncanny.
She's got to meet you right away.

134
00:09:58,465 --> 00:09:59,599
Can you manage?

135
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,068
Sure.

136
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,836
I'll be back in one second.

137
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,137
Okay!

138
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:07,007
I can manage!

139
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:18,385
Hello.

140
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,388
What are you doing with my boxes?
Wait, but those are my packages!

141
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,323
Help me, somebody!

142
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:24,925
Help!

143
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:26,293
Help!

144
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,104
Go!

145
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,438
Are you okay?

146
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:39,773
I'm fine.

147
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,675
I hope his nose

148
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,243
hurts worse than my hand.

149
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,445
Oh, you are wonderful.
Danke schoen.

150
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,315
You were great!
What a great umbrella!

151
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,449
Strong!

152
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:50,617
Sturdy!

153
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,586
Shall we go?

154
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,654
Yeah.

155
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:03,463
Freeway! Come here, baby!

156
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,401
Did you miss your mommy?

157
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,570
Guess who else missed mommy?

158
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,107
Uh-huh.

159
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,376
Mmm...

160
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:26,954
Let me go over
the guest-list again.

161
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,056
Room-service, housekeeping,

162
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,190
the doorman?

163
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:32,592
Not so hard-working
and useful, I'm afraid.

164
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,027
Peter Donner.

165
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:35,729
Welcome, Mr. Hart.

166
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:37,164
Jonathan.

167
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,599
Peter took me to lunch.

168
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,268
- That was nice of you.
- It was my pleasure.

169
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:44,237
And afterward he showed me
some wonderful shops

170
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:45,906
and he saved my life

171
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:48,075
-then we came back here.

172
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,077
- He saved my life.
- It was more like your packages, really.

173
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,479
Oh, he was grabbing at me too.

174
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,682
Oh no, not Peter.

175
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:57,384
The mugger!

176
00:11:57,785 --> 00:11:58,786
Mugger?

177
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:00,253
The one who wanted my packages.

178
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,755
I hit him in the nose.

179
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,523
Bobby stomped on his feet.

180
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,893
Sister Lillian whacked him
with her umbrella

181
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,628
while Franz hit him over the
head with his newspaper.

182
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,730
I...

183
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:12,465
kicked him in the shins.

184
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:13,533
You alright?

185
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,635
I'm fine...

186
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,370
thanks to Peter

187
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:20,107
and the good citizens of Munich.

188
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,541
Well, I'm very grateful.

189
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:24,011
Oh, not as grateful as I am to
you and to Jennifer

190
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,914
for coming all this way to
help the Bone-Marrow Program.

191
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,450
Well, when Jennifer heard that she was
the perfect match for your recipient,

192
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:33,053
we started making our travel
plans right away.

193
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,588
I understand that it's
your anniversary.

194
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:39,026
We have much to celebrate because I'm
getting married myself, Saturday.

195
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,694
To someone who looks exactly
like me, according to Peter.

196
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,430
Congratulations.

197
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,465
They... They could be twins.

198
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:47,034
I was just trying to call her.

199
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,502
Would you like to meet
Maximilian?

200
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,972
Maximilian?

201
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,941
The recipient of your
bone-marrow.

202
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:57,777
His name is Max?

203
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:59,112
Yes.

204
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,547
Well, sure.

205
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:06,253
We'd love to meet someone
called Max.

206
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:10,257
We've tried to make Max's life as normal
as possible under the circumstances,

207
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:13,093
but he has a particular hobby,
which is important to him.

208
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,794
Oh, let me see...

209
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:16,997
8-year-old boy...

210
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:18,198
football.

211
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,868
Chasing 8-year-old girls.

212
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,772
These rocket
clubs are all over Germany

213
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,440
and the championship...

214
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,378
is being held in Stuttgart
at the end of the month

215
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:34,047
and Max, he's planning to
compete.

216
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:35,949
So soon after
the operation?

217
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:37,817
He's a very
determined boy

218
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:40,153
and we've caught the disease
at an early stage, so...

219
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,089
so we're hopeful.

220
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,057
How long has Max
been in a wheel

221
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:47,160
That's not Max,
that's Phillip.

222
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,428
Phillip...

223
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:51,098
Yeah, he tried to parachute
off the school roof.

224
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,100
That's Max, over there.

225
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,301
Come on, dog!

226
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,537
Maybe Freeway can introduce us.

227
00:13:57,604 --> 00:13:59,272
Max!

228
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,841
Hi Peter, did you see my blast

229
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:06,379
Look! I think I found
a copilot.

230
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:09,349
Well, he has had some
flying lessons.

231
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,851
Oh, hi Simone!

232
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,520
This is Jennifer

233
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,388
and Jonathan Hart.

234
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,758
Good.

235
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:21,995
Why are you calling Simone
Jennifer?

236
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,530
Because she is Jennifer.

237
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,332
This is your bone-marrow donor.

238
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,134
Your name is really Jennifer?

239
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,103
My name is really Jennifer.

240
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,406
You're going to save my life,
Jennifer. Did you know that?

241
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:36,543
Well, I'm certainly gonna try.

242
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,512
I'm gonna blast-off again.
Can I take my copilot?

243
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:40,580
Sure.

244
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,749
Come on, doggie. Here, boy!
Come on!

245
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,151
His name is Freeway!

246
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,353
Hey, Freeway!
Come on, Freeway!

247
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,291
He's a very brave little boy.

248
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,893
Braver than you think.

249
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:57,197
He's an orphan.

250
00:14:57,264 --> 00:15:00,000
I think we'd both like to spend
a little more time with him.

251
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,238
Maybe we'll hang out here
for a while.

252
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,276
I knew I'd find
the right people.

253
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:15,315
Kleenex?

254
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,050
Bone

255
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,686
You think I enjoy watching
money that belongs to me

256
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,989
tumbling into a bottomless pit?

257
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,523
It doesn't matter.

258
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,358
I am going home.

259
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,961
Not until you fulfill your
bargain with me.

260
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:30,330
Have you forgotten
you signed this paper?

261
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,499
That was before I met him.

262
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:35,268
Now I know him.
He's a wonderful man.

263
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:37,670
I really care for him.

264
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,507
There's nothing more boring
than listening to a tramp,

265
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,875
trying to develop a conscience.

266
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,444
I will go to the police!

267
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:45,678
Oh, you will?

268
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:47,981
And what do you tell them?

269
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:51,451
You have the record for fraud.

270
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:53,586
Your signature is on this paper

271
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:57,090
and the local magistrate is my
weekly chess partner.

272
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:59,092
You have two alternatives.

273
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,294
One, you can accept my
offer for money

274
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:03,796
or you can rot in
a German prison.

275
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,301
What will happen to Peter

276
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:09,702
after the marriage?

277
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:12,239
What concern is it of yours?

278
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,108
One way or the other,
he will be out of your life.

279
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:17,977
Oh...

280
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:20,580
Please don't be sad.

281
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:25,352
Five million dollars is a very
effective vaccine against loneliness.

282
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,821
Well, what is it?

283
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,496
Nothing... Nothing.

284
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:37,564
Nothing.

285
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,770
I wonder what's keeping
your twin.

286
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,239
Oh, Peter said
she's always late.

287
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,408
Well, there's one difference.

288
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,577
I never had to wait for you.

289
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:51,644
Aw...

290
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,414
How sweet of you to remember
it that way.

291
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:58,085
Except at the altar.

292
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:01,020
I thought you weren't going
to bring that up again.

293
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:03,356
I just wanted everything
to be perfect.

294
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:08,061
I'm so sorry...
so sorry that I'm late.

295
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:09,996
Fritz!

296
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:12,132
- Our table, please.
- Right away, Herr Donner.

297
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,666
Good evening, Fraulein Grohe.

298
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,034
And to you, sir.

299
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,704
Fraulein Grohe?

300
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,173
I really do have to meet
this woman.

301
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:28,481
Unless things change
drastically, Jennifer,

302
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,783
that may never happen.

303
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,087
Amazing.

304
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:41,261
And I found this in my coat-pocket when
I went to pick her up at the hotel.

305
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:44,897
Unbelievable.

306
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:48,935
Oh, she's having second
thoughts about the wedding.

307
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,804
I can read between the lines.
She'll be back.

308
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,108
Do you know where she is?

309
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:57,377
No... No, and I'm running
out of time.

310
00:17:57,444 --> 00:18:00,647
Unless Simone and I show up
for the prenuptial ball

311
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:01,981
tomorrow night,

312
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,783
it'll be a major embarrassment
for my family.

313
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,852
There are people coming
from all over Europe.

314
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,588
Maybe you could postpone it.

315
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,291
Rain delay.

316
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,994
Rain delay?

317
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,096
Yeah, like baseball games.

318
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:19,432
Baseball Ball?

319
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:22,469
Just a thought.

320
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,638
My cousin, Karl Von Ostenberg,

321
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,674
has arranged everything down
to the last detail.

322
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,377
This would be a major scandal
that he couldn't live down.

323
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,613
I can't embarrass Karl
after all he's done for me.

324
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,258
Uh-oh.

325
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:46,393
There's that look.

326
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,860
What look?

327
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:51,398
That transparent look that tells
me exactly what you're thinking.

328
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,601
You couldn't possibly know
what I was thinking.

329
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,404
She's thinking...

330
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,540
that you're such a nice man that maybe
she could go to the ball with you

331
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:03,443
and pass herself off as Simone.

332
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:08,781
What a hair-brained,
far-fetched idea.

333
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,883
Ridiculous, isn't it?

334
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,619
Totally bizarre.

335
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,254
Is that what you thought
I was thinking?

336
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,589
That's exactly what I thought
you were thinking.

337
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:21,428
We'd never be able to
pull that off.

338
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,265
Would we?

339
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:29,669
Not a chance.

340
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,371
But that is what you
were thinking.

341
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,141
Something like that.

342
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,809
Something like that?

343
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,546
All right, exactly like that.

344
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:46,018
It is completely insane,
of course.

345
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,256
But...

346
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:59,098
What ever happened to the good old days
when all anybody wanted to borrow was a

347
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:00,633
cup of sugar?

348
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:16,516
The Donners and the Grohes
built a vast fortune together

349
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,852
but then their families became estranged
enemies. You know, like the...

350
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,754
Hatfields and the McCoys?

351
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:24,324
You think the British
royal family has problems.

352
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:25,858
Just wait.

353
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:30,096
My family makes the Windsors look
like the Von Trapp Family Singers.

354
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:41,140
Grandfather desperately wanted
to marry Ludmila Grohe,

355
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:42,909
but she ran off with her
brother instead.

356
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,011
Her brother?

357
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,746
Yes, grandfather was furious

358
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:48,915
so he drove the Grohes
out of business

359
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,850
and out of the country, but...

360
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,285
on his deathbed,

361
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,287
never having resolved
the loss of his love,

362
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:57,724
he wanted to repent. So he put
the money of both families

363
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,526
into a trust,

364
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:03,162
never to be released until the
Grohes and the Donners married.

365
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:07,634
Your father didn't get
the money?

366
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:12,138
My father was in
an insane asylum.

367
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,341
You see, my mother had run off
with the gardener,

368
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,776
who was actually working
for the Grohes.

369
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:19,145
And when my mother found out
that she

370
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,813
was set up,

371
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,783
she took some of the Grohes
for a picnic in her car

372
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,018
and drove them off the bridge.

373
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,796
Well, I wouldn't worry
about the money.

374
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:40,600
Geraldo or Sally Jessy would pay a
fortune to have a guest like you.

375
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:41,901
Sally Jessy?

376
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,102
Television people.

377
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:50,843
So you don't control the trust?

378
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,713
No. My cousin,
Karl Von Ostenberg, does.

379
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,915
He's been very generous to me

380
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,017
but I've been losing a lot
of money with the clinic

381
00:21:58,084 --> 00:21:59,819
and if this wedding
doesn't happen,

382
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:02,755
he may decide that he has to
shut it down.

383
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,724
How did you meet Simone?

384
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:07,026
It wouldn't have happened
if it weren't for Karl.

385
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:09,762
He was wonderful.

386
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,330
He took out advertisements,

387
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:15,101
he sent out investigators
to look for a living Grohe

388
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,436
and he found her!

389
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,073
For a while,

390
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,342
I wondered if I could

391
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,011
marry someone

392
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,980
that I didn't love
for the sake of the clinic.

393
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:29,816
The answer was no.

394
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,718
But as luck would have it,

395
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,486
there was Simone.

396
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:35,254
That's lucky, isn't it, darling?

397
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:36,656
Yes.

398
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:38,958
And timely.

399
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:42,261
I'm sure she'll come to her senses 'cause
we really do love each other, you know.

400
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:45,131
- Aw...
- That's why Jennifer's kind offer...

401
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,399
Look, Peter...

402
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,068
let us sleep on it, would you?

403
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:51,303
Your hotel is just
around the corner.

404
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,105
Goodnight.

405
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:54,340
And don't worry.

406
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:55,908
Don't worry.

407
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:57,577
Things will work out.

408
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:08,888
That's the most dysfunctional
family I've ever heard of.

409
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:09,956
Isn't it?

410
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:12,124
It's a wonder Peter's so nice.

411
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,694
He is nice, isn't he?

412
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:20,600
That's why we should
do this for him.

413
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:23,636
No, that's why something
doesn't add up.

414
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:25,880
Well, Peter is a very
bright, attractive guy.

415
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:26,630
Mmm-hmm.

416
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:29,450
Soon to be a very rich,
bright, attractive guy.

417
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:30,400
Mmm-hmm.

418
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:32,712
So why wouldn't Simone
want to marry him?

419
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:35,281
I don't know.

420
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:38,084
- Could be dozens of reasons.
- Well, that's my point.

421
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,686
We don't know Simone.

422
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:43,089
Who she is, what she wants, who
her friends and enemies are.

423
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:46,025
You pretend to be her
for just a few hours,

424
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:48,795
those friends and enemies
become yours.

425
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:49,862
Mmm.

426
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,601
Now you're looking at me
with that other look.

427
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,435
What other look?

428
00:23:56,503 --> 00:23:58,104
That look that tells me you're
going to be stubborn about this.

429
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:00,673
You...

430
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:06,946
Mmm...

431
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:09,916
I know that look too.

432
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,184
What look?

433
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:16,222
That look that tells me that somehow
this Cinderella is not going to the ball

434
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,657
without her prince.

435
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:20,359
- You can bet your glass slippers on that.
- Uh-huh.

436
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:22,862
And you know what, prince?

437
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:24,263
That's me.

438
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:26,398
I like that look.

439
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,935
Come here.

440
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,572
Mmm.

441
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,252
That should be
Mr. Jonathan Hart,

442
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,956
American business man of
considerable wealth and reputation.

443
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:54,927
It seems he wants to buy
the Donner Brewery,

444
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,496
all cash.

445
00:24:57,564 --> 00:25:00,833
Until Peter's inheritance is in your
name, you can't sell it to him legally.

446
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,802
I want you to go
and show him in.

447
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:05,638
Don't spare the charm.
Lots of teeth.

448
00:25:05,705 --> 00:25:08,307
Then I want you to go have a
conversation with... what's her name?

449
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:10,076
- Simone.
- Simone, yes.

450
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:14,246
Remember if Simone doesn't marry
Peter, you can't marry me.

451
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:15,948
Macht schnell. Raus.

452
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:21,453
♪ She's the
sweetest, little rosebud

453
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,956
♪ that Texas ever knew

454
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:29,662
My, my...

455
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:34,701
Not too shabby.

456
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:41,808
Not too shabby at all.

457
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,343
Mr. Hart,

458
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,113
I'm Elsa.

459
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:50,282
We're honored to have such
a distinguished guest.

460
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,619
Welcome to our little home.

461
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:57,890
You didn't have to go to all
of this trouble for me.

462
00:25:57,957 --> 00:26:01,360
I'm sorry. This is for
our party tonight.

463
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:03,863
If I were decorating for you,

464
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,231
I'd start with me.

465
00:26:05,665 --> 00:26:07,499
Whoa.

466
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,001
Karl is expecting you.

467
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:26,318
Mr. Hart, please.

468
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:30,122
Thank you,

469
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:31,323
honey.

470
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,099
Mr. Hart!

471
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,701
Karl Von Ostenberg.

472
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:43,602
You can call me Jonathan, Karl.

473
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,937
Jonathan,

474
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:46,238
I'm puzzled.

475
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:49,241
I must admit I've done a bit
of snooping into your affairs.

476
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:50,576
Is that a fact?

477
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:52,078
Beer

478
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:56,683
It doesn't seem to fit, even remotely,
into your mix of companies.

479
00:26:56,749 --> 00:27:00,619
Karl, do you know what the watch

480
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,455
Semiconductors.

481
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:05,157
I wasn't aware of that.

482
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:09,428
Do you know what the new watch-word
is for the 21st century?

483
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:11,931
Diversify.

484
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:13,199
Diversify?

485
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:15,267
- Diversify.
- Diversi-fy.

486
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,670
And I intend to stay ahead
of the game.

487
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:21,941
Well, in that case, let me invite
you to examine the merchandise.

488
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:23,575
Don't mind if I do.

489
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:26,879
Prost.

490
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:28,080
Whatever.

491
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:35,621
If the brewery's as good
as the brew,

492
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:37,924
then we do have something
to talk about.

493
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,425
Good.

494
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,360
There is one small problem.

495
00:27:41,427 --> 00:27:42,494
What's that?

496
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:45,564
I cannot sell the brewery for...

497
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:47,299
a few days.
There are certain...

498
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:49,501
papers that need
to be transferred.

499
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:51,137
It'll take perhaps...

500
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:52,304
a week.

501
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:55,207
Oh Karl, that'd put a twist
in my shorts.

502
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,877
I don't plan on being
in Munich that long.

503
00:27:57,944 --> 00:27:58,911
Well,

504
00:27:58,978 --> 00:28:00,646
plans can change.

505
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:04,283
How can I entice you to stay?

506
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,753
You can't.

507
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:08,420
But that...

508
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:10,689
Fraulein I met...

509
00:28:10,757 --> 00:28:12,658
Oh, my cousin, Elsa.

510
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:14,260
Cousin?

511
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:15,627
Many times removed.

512
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,429
Sorry to hear about that...

513
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:20,166
You see...

514
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:23,169
My wife is not with me
on this trip.

515
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:24,904
Oh, really?

516
00:28:24,971 --> 00:28:27,506
Well in that case,
why don't I put her

517
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:30,309
next you at my dinner tonight.

518
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:31,778
Karl...

519
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:34,480
Are you mixing business
with pleasure?

520
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,415
I can only vouch for
the business

521
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:40,987
but Elsa knows all about the pleasure
and you can take my word for that.

522
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:51,463
We still have to get you a fake beauty
mark and take a trip to the hair-dresser

523
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,699
but I've shown you most
of Simone's favorite places,

524
00:28:53,766 --> 00:28:55,935
just in case someone
mentions them.

525
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:58,805
I can certainly see why this
was one of them.

526
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:07,746
Or as Simone would say,

527
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:11,050
"I can see why this was one
of them."

528
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:12,684
A little softer with...

529
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,953
Yes.

530
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:18,757
I can see why this was one
of them.

531
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:20,159
By George, I think
you've got it.

532
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:29,168
Ah, it's so beautiful.

533
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,372
Yes, Simone thought so as well.

534
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:38,878
Aw!

535
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:42,048
This is where and when

536
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,415
we first kissed.

537
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:44,951
Aw...

538
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:51,323
Peter, I'm not Simone.

539
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:55,294
Yes... Yes, of course.

540
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:59,431
Any woman would come back to a man who
remembers their first kiss the way you do.

541
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,400
Come on.

542
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,335
I'll be late for
that hair-dresser.

543
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,476
Orderlies to station,
please.

544
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,611
Jonathan,
this is Dr. Detmeier.

545
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:14,646
She's heading up
Max's operation.

546
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:16,682
Nice to meet you.

547
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,617
This is Jonathan Hart and

548
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:20,186
that is Freeway.

549
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:26,025
I thought maybe Max's copilot
might cheer him up.

550
00:30:26,092 --> 00:30:27,493
I hope it's all right.

551
00:30:27,927 --> 00:30:29,328
Well...

552
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:31,230
it's not strictly sanitary,

553
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:32,965
but...

554
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:35,301
Perhaps just this once.

555
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:38,971
This is the first stage of his final
test and he told me he's scared.

556
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:41,473
He's never admitted that before.

557
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:45,044
Well, maybe a wagging tail is
just what the doctor ordered.

558
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,116
Freeway!

559
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,717
Here's your copilot.

560
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:54,921
You ready for take

561
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,691
I don't wanna go with them.

562
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,695
Doctor, would they excuse us
for a moment?

563
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:04,931
Of course.

564
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:06,298
Wait please.

565
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:11,537
What do you mean, you don't
want to go with them?

566
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:14,240
I don't wanna go with them
because I'm scared.

567
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:20,479
What do astronauts do
when they see a cloud?

568
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,614
They fly right through them.

569
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:24,216
Right.

570
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:30,089
Why don't you think of this
operation as a cloud?

571
00:31:30,156 --> 00:31:33,659
And you're gonna fly right through
it and come out on the other side?

572
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,028
Like an adventure?

573
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:37,896
Like an adventure

574
00:31:37,964 --> 00:31:39,731
in the wild, blue yonder,

575
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:40,799
hmm?

576
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:43,235
Okay.

577
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:44,703
You ready for blast

578
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:46,372
Ready.

579
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:51,577
Ready for count-down.

580
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:52,811
Check.

581
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,047
Ten...

582
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:56,983
nine...

583
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:58,684
eight...

584
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:00,452
seven...

585
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,354
six...

586
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:04,323
five...

587
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:05,891
four...

588
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:16,135
This is as far as you can go,
Mr. Hart.

589
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,276
Only astronauts from this
point on, Freeway.

590
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:27,113
Happy landings, Captain Max.

591
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:48,267
You still have not changed
your mind?

592
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:56,208
Simone, time is rapidly
running out for you.

593
00:32:56,275 --> 00:33:00,279
If you do not live up to your
bargain and marry Peter,

594
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:03,582
I have no earthly use for you.
Do you understand that?

595
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:11,357
Do you understand that?

596
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:16,695
Good.

597
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:22,334
Tonight when Peter
enters the ball

598
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:23,769
without you,

599
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,472
at the moment of his greatest
humiliation,

600
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,607
you will make your entrance.

601
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:32,211
You had a bad case of the
nerves, you came to me

602
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:34,380
and I was able to
affect a joyful

603
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,048
family reunion, ja?

604
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:38,450
Don't forget to cry.

605
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:40,419
Yeah, good.

606
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,195
And by the way...

607
00:33:49,261 --> 00:33:51,763
if you do not think that
money can make you happy,

608
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,832
well, you've never had enough
to know.

609
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:58,036
Five million dollars.

610
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:01,207
What's there to think about?

611
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,520
She walks like Simone,

612
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:17,055
talks like Simone...

613
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,504
I can't wait to meet this woman.

614
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:06,605
The Count and Countess

615
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:08,874
Goess-Ensenberg.

616
00:35:12,678 --> 00:35:13,912
Howdy.

617
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:17,583
How y'all doing?

618
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:19,418
Baron Wunderland

619
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:21,520
and lady Applegate.

620
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,928
Jonathan Hart.

621
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:34,032
Mr. Jonathan Hart.

622
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:36,735
Thank you, little fella.

623
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:47,613
Mr. Hart.

624
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:51,116
I believe we are seated next
to each other at Karl's table.

625
00:35:51,183 --> 00:35:53,885
Do you mind if I consider
you my escort?

626
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:55,020
Well,

627
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:58,089
even a blind hog can find
an acorn now and then.

628
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,458
I beg your pardon?

629
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:00,826
I'd be proud.

630
00:36:02,228 --> 00:36:03,695
Jonathan,

631
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:07,098
I see you found my lovely
cousin, Elsa.

632
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,301
We sort of found each other.

633
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:12,204
And where I come from, we like
to play "finders, keepers."

634
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:22,013
Mr. Peter Donner.

635
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:40,098
Ms. Simone Grohe.

636
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:45,737
Ah!

637
00:36:58,784 --> 00:37:00,085
What's the matter, Karl?

638
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:02,053
Something go down the wrong way?

639
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:15,901
Let me go!

640
00:37:17,703 --> 00:37:18,837
No!

641
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:19,938
Ahh!

642
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,012
They sure do make
a lovely couple.

643
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:31,016
Ahhh!

644
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,651
Who is that woman?

645
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:36,455
Right now, she seems to be you.

646
00:37:38,324 --> 00:37:39,525
Ahhh!

647
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,961
Witch!

648
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:56,475
My beauty-mark is itching.

649
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:59,244
- I think it's moving.
- You're doing beautifully.

650
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,212
Here we go.

651
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,549
Karl and Elsa are
at the end of the line.

652
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,216
I've already told you
everything about them.

653
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,486
The first man you're going
to meet is my cousin, Helmut.

654
00:38:07,553 --> 00:38:09,855
He's going to pinch you on the
bottom, give you a bear-hug

655
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:11,723
and you always kiss
him on the nose.

656
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,891
I do?

657
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:14,092
One in every family.

658
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,862
Simone!

659
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:27,639
Who is this fool?

660
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:29,541
The resemblance is phenomenal.

661
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:31,843
Whoever she is,

662
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,413
Aunt Edna will notice
the difference.

663
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:38,584
Next is Aunt Edna.

664
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,218
She's your best friend
in the family,

665
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:41,787
the only one who approves
of the clinic.

666
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:42,554
Kiss both cheeks.

667
00:38:42,621 --> 00:38:44,390
Aunt Edna!

668
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:48,894
You look wonderful!

669
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,933
Your hair!

670
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:57,302
My hair?

671
00:38:57,369 --> 00:38:59,571
You've done something different.

672
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:01,139
Oh...

673
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,614
I like it, Simone!

674
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,015
You do?

675
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:15,353
Well, we must have tea next week.
I'll tell you all my secrets.

676
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:16,855
Peter, darling,

677
00:39:16,922 --> 00:39:18,890
I hear you found a donor

678
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:20,926
who's a match to that young boy.

679
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:22,628
A perfect match, in fact.

680
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,463
Everything's going to be
just fine.

681
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,033
Bye bye...

682
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,039
Simone.

683
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:36,174
You look lovely.

684
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:37,876
Thank you, Karl.

685
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:40,612
Elsa!

686
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:43,515
You look wonderful.

687
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:45,383
You've been working out again.

688
00:39:45,451 --> 00:39:48,053
It does wonders for your figure.

689
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:50,188
Thank you,

690
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:51,389
Simone.

691
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:56,662
You look like you've been
working out too.

692
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,798
I don't believe I've had the
pleasure, Monsieur...

693
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:01,066
Hart.

694
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,301
Jonathan Hart.

695
00:40:04,436 --> 00:40:05,804
Well...

696
00:40:05,871 --> 00:40:09,274
And what brings you to Munich,
Monsieur Hart?

697
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,610
A little business,
a little pleasure.

698
00:40:11,677 --> 00:40:12,711
Ah...

699
00:40:12,778 --> 00:40:16,081
Well perhaps we'll be seeing
more of you.

700
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:17,683
Monsieur...

701
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,350
Hart, honey.

702
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,419
And you can count on it,
Ms. Grohe.

703
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,827
That Simone woman is as pretty
as a June bug.

704
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:31,062
Truly. Yeah, yeah.

705
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,099
She is very remarkable.

706
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,580
Bring Simone down.

707
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:51,282
Expose this woman as a fraud.

708
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:53,885
Not until I know
why she is here.

709
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,186
Who is she?

710
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:56,688
What is Peter up to?

711
00:40:56,755 --> 00:40:59,357
Is he on to us?

712
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:02,160
I haven't waltzed since
I've been in short-pants.

713
00:41:02,227 --> 00:41:03,695
Care to take a twirl?

714
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:05,196
Yes, delighted.

715
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,235
Auntie Edna!

716
00:41:13,038 --> 00:41:14,706
That Simone woman said

717
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:16,708
you like to work out.

718
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:18,710
I'm a sucker
for physical fitness.

719
00:41:18,777 --> 00:41:20,245
I fence mostly.

720
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,549
How well do you swing
a sword, Jonathan?

721
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:27,485
Well, where I come from, Elsa,

722
00:41:27,553 --> 00:41:29,287
that could mean several things.

723
00:41:30,756 --> 00:41:33,592
We'll have to try another
picnic soon.

724
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:36,828
Yes! It was wonderful.

725
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:38,129
Wasn't it?

726
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:41,099
Watching all the delicious
food get soaked?

727
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,802
I thought it would
never stop raining.

728
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:45,837
Raining?

729
00:41:45,904 --> 00:41:48,674
I fell in the river.

730
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,142
And almost drowned.

731
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:52,811
Yes.

732
00:41:53,712 --> 00:41:55,914
I'm an excellent swimmer.

733
00:41:57,382 --> 00:41:59,517
What's wrong with you, Simone?

734
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,554
Well really, Erwin, have you
completely

735
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:04,923
lost your sense of humor?

736
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:12,130
With your permission, Peter...

737
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:14,265
What about once around
with the bride?

738
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:15,567
Of course.

739
00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:17,836
My pleasure.

740
00:42:22,674 --> 00:42:24,475
Oh, I'm so glad you came along.

741
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,344
I was about to blow it.

742
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:27,779
You're doing fine.

743
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:30,682
- You're the belle of the ball.
- Ah!

744
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:33,151
Elsa seemed very attentive.

745
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,486
Like a predator in a water-hole.

746
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,888
Don't turn your back on her.

747
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:50,836
The night is young, Carita.

748
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,172
And as Valentino said,

749
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:57,743
"There's nothing like tile
for the tango."

750
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:17,262
Wait.

751
00:43:18,396 --> 00:43:20,298
You've got my beauty mark.

752
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:23,869
What are we gonna do?

753
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:26,404
I've got an idea.

754
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:37,415
Is it there?

755
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:38,984
Yeah.

756
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,585
You got it back but it's
a couple inches too high.

757
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:42,888
- Uh-oh.
- Better try the power room.

758
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:46,291
That man.

759
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:51,830
He's the one who mugged me
and tried to take my packages.

760
00:43:51,897 --> 00:43:54,565
What's he doing here and why
is he talking to Elsa?

761
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,001
Well, he's got some nerve.

762
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:57,302
She's my date.

763
00:44:15,186 --> 00:44:16,988
May I help you?

764
00:44:18,123 --> 00:44:19,991
I was looking for
the men's room.

765
00:44:20,926 --> 00:44:22,193
It's back there.

766
00:44:23,194 --> 00:44:24,595
Take a right

767
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,764
and a left.

768
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:10,175
Oh, my...

769
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:09,968
A right

770
00:46:10,035 --> 00:46:11,369
and then a left.

771
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:12,804
Excellent directions.

772
00:47:07,392 --> 00:47:10,261
Do the antique vases in this
castle belong to you?

773
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,329
No.

774
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:12,830
Good.

775
00:47:13,965 --> 00:47:15,500
Who was that man?

776
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:18,169
Someone who works for Karl.

777
00:47:18,236 --> 00:47:21,206
He's got Simone locked up
like the prisoner of Zenda.

778
00:47:21,272 --> 00:47:24,042
She's all right but she's
understandably upset.

779
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:27,045
You... You must be mistaken.
Not Karl.

780
00:47:27,112 --> 00:47:29,981
It's his castle and his
merry men.

781
00:47:30,048 --> 00:47:32,517
Well I've got to settle this
matter with Karl immediately.

782
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:36,754
If you confront Karl, then everyone
will know that Jennifer is not Simone.

783
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:39,157
I can't just leave
her alone in there.

784
00:47:39,224 --> 00:47:41,859
And I'm not gonna
put my wife in danger.

785
00:47:41,927 --> 00:47:44,295
But if Karl knows
I'm not Simone,

786
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,331
why hasn't he said anything?

787
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:48,299
They didn't expect you
to be here.

788
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:49,901
Whatever they had planned,

789
00:47:49,968 --> 00:47:51,769
you are now in the way.

790
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:55,506
I hate being in the way.

791
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:57,275
What do we do now?

792
00:47:57,342 --> 00:47:59,610
Well, they haven't exposed
their hand, so

793
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:02,347
we won't expose ours.

794
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:05,450
I trust you've found your
evening enjoyable.

795
00:48:05,516 --> 00:48:08,920
I can't begin to tell you
what I found tonight, Karl.

796
00:48:09,988 --> 00:48:11,622
My, my...

797
00:48:11,689 --> 00:48:15,026
I'm afraid I'm exhausted
from all this dancing.

798
00:48:15,793 --> 00:48:18,663
Peter, would you take me home?

799
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,466
I think I'll push
myself off too.

800
00:48:21,532 --> 00:48:24,435
No offense folks, but the
champagne and the jet-lag

801
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:27,005
has turned my brain to mush.

802
00:48:27,072 --> 00:48:29,474
Be careful of the night air,
Simone.

803
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,309
You might catch your death...

804
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:33,711
of cold.

805
00:48:34,712 --> 00:48:36,614
Oh, Karl...

806
00:48:36,681 --> 00:48:40,018
You are always thinking
about someone else.

807
00:48:48,826 --> 00:48:51,596
Are you going to just let
her walk out of here?

808
00:48:52,363 --> 00:48:53,965
Find out who she is.

809
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:57,202
Two Simones,

810
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,304
an embarrassment of riches.

811
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,939
Now our only problem
is to decide...

812
00:49:02,007 --> 00:49:03,008
which one

813
00:49:03,074 --> 00:49:04,209
to kill.

814
00:49:20,025 --> 00:49:23,061
No one.

815
00:49:23,128 --> 00:49:25,796
I'll try calling that
detective agency again.

816
00:49:25,863 --> 00:49:27,565
Maybe they're open by now.

817
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:29,800
Where could he have gone?

818
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:32,403
I don't know, but if you want to pick
up a few colorful phrases in German,

819
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:35,440
try yelling "Freeway" in the streets
of Munich at five in the morning,

820
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:36,507
Hmm?

821
00:49:40,145 --> 00:49:42,980
You might take that
beauty mark off now.

822
00:49:44,249 --> 00:49:47,218
I'm afraid I've grown
attached to it.

823
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:48,886
Well, that's nice, darling but,

824
00:49:48,953 --> 00:49:50,755
I prefer you the way you were.

825
00:49:57,162 --> 00:49:58,496
Still not in.

826
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:00,831
Actually, I can't.

827
00:50:00,898 --> 00:50:02,333
You can't what?

828
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,601
Take it off.

829
00:50:08,073 --> 00:50:09,474
You see...

830
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,909
I was so desperate to keep it
in place last night that I...

831
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:13,844
found some crazy-glue in a
desk and I'm afraid

832
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:15,246
I welded it on.

833
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,516
Simone lives.

834
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:20,251
Look, we all bit off

835
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:21,852
a little more than we
could chew last night.

836
00:50:21,919 --> 00:50:23,388
Peter's a nice man,

837
00:50:23,454 --> 00:50:24,822
but we didn't come all the way
to Munich

838
00:50:24,889 --> 00:50:27,458
to get involved
in an episode of Family Feud.

839
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:30,095
We came here to save the life
of a young boy.

840
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:33,064
But we can't just
walk out on Peter.

841
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:35,566
And I'm partially responsible
for the fix he's in.

842
00:50:35,633 --> 00:50:37,168
It was my idea
to go to the ball.

843
00:50:37,235 --> 00:50:38,469
You wanted to help.

844
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:40,004
You always do.

845
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:42,340
That's why I married you
instead of Simone Grohe.

846
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:44,075
Right now,
we have two priorities.

847
00:50:44,142 --> 00:50:45,810
One to save young Max,

848
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,245
and the other to find Freeway.

849
00:50:47,312 --> 00:50:48,813
I'll change.

850
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:49,980
Oh...

851
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:53,884
Poor Freeway, our little baby,

852
00:50:53,951 --> 00:50:56,821
all alone in a strange city.

853
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,056
His little heart must
be breaking.

854
00:51:09,834 --> 00:51:12,002
Max! Time to go!

855
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,272
- Max!
- I'm coming!

856
00:51:47,672 --> 00:51:49,540
Freeway!

857
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,041
Freeway!

858
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,979
Freeway, baby!
Come here!

859
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:56,080
Freeway!

860
00:51:59,484 --> 00:52:01,118
No.

861
00:52:01,186 --> 00:52:02,687
Don't worry. We'll find him.

862
00:52:14,165 --> 00:52:16,100
Freeway!

863
00:52:19,103 --> 00:52:21,206
Freeway!

864
00:52:21,272 --> 00:52:23,641
Jonathan! Jennifer!

865
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:25,210
I got your message at the hotel.

866
00:52:25,276 --> 00:52:27,945
I contacted a friend who runs
a dog-walking club.

867
00:52:28,012 --> 00:52:30,080
She's going to get all of her
members out looking for Freeway.

868
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,350
Oh, Peter, that's
so kind of you.

869
00:52:32,417 --> 00:52:34,219
Well, between the police,

870
00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:36,321
the private eyes,
the dog-walkers and us

871
00:52:36,387 --> 00:52:38,055
it's just a matter of time.

872
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:40,258
Speaking of the police,

873
00:52:40,325 --> 00:52:43,027
what have you decided
to do about Simone?

874
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:45,095
I didn't sleep one hour
last night.

875
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,964
I almost called the police
and then I thought

876
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:49,500
that the local tabloids
would turn this into a circus.

877
00:52:49,567 --> 00:52:50,868
Why on Earth

878
00:52:50,935 --> 00:52:52,203
would Karl kidnap her?

879
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:54,305
What could he possibly
gain by it?

880
00:52:54,372 --> 00:52:56,574
Well, he could stop the wedding.

881
00:52:56,641 --> 00:52:59,410
That would prevent you from
coming into a lot of money.

882
00:52:59,477 --> 00:53:02,046
Yes, but it wouldn't become
his money.

883
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:04,582
He merely administrates
the trust.

884
00:53:04,649 --> 00:53:06,384
Don't take this the wrong way,
Peter.

885
00:53:07,785 --> 00:53:10,588
Maybe she wasn't kidnapped.

886
00:53:10,655 --> 00:53:12,557
Maybe they're both
in on it somehow.

887
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:14,625
If that were true,

888
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:16,461
why would he lock her up?

889
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:19,964
We have to find some way
of getting her out of there.

890
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:24,001
Maybe we could sneak in through
one of the secret passageways!

891
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:27,838
Sure.

892
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:29,774
What secret passageways?

893
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,978
Well, don't be silly. All those old
castles have secret passageways.

894
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,780
...In the movies.

895
00:53:35,846 --> 00:53:38,449
Well, Jennifer is due at the
hospital for some tests.

896
00:53:38,516 --> 00:53:40,385
I'm afraid you'll be sedated
for a couple of hours.

897
00:53:40,451 --> 00:53:42,320
We'll meet you there

898
00:53:42,387 --> 00:53:44,889
and when Jennifer's recovered, we'll
all go out and visit cousin Karl,

899
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:48,626
come clean, lay our cards on the
table and demand an explanation.

900
00:53:48,693 --> 00:53:50,728
What if he denies everything?

901
00:53:50,795 --> 00:53:52,663
Simple...

902
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,300
Peter and I will keep him busy while
you check the secret passageway.

903
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,270
Auf wiedersehen.

904
00:53:59,337 --> 00:54:00,771
Auf wiedersehen.

905
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:04,742
Freeway!

906
00:54:07,211 --> 00:54:10,548
They all stick together, darling.
He won't tell you a thing.

907
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:13,551
Let's try over there.

908
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:15,085
We'll find him, darling.
I promise

909
00:54:15,152 --> 00:54:17,221
but right now we've gotta
get you to Peter's clinic.

910
00:54:17,288 --> 00:54:19,290
Oh, just for a minute.

911
00:54:19,357 --> 00:54:21,225
All right. Only just
for a minute.

912
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:26,597
He called her darling.

913
00:54:29,233 --> 00:54:31,068
They're going to Peter's clinic.

914
00:55:41,606 --> 00:55:44,274
You've heard something
from that pair of dummkopfs?

915
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:47,578
I ordered a computer search
on Jonathan Hart.

916
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:49,179
And?

917
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:54,419
While we were busy
congratulating ourselves,

918
00:55:54,485 --> 00:55:58,423
Mr. and Mrs. Hart were
making utter fools of us.

919
00:55:58,489 --> 00:56:01,692
It seems Mrs. Hart is undergoing
tests at Peter's clinic

920
00:56:01,759 --> 00:56:03,594
for the next few hours.

921
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,331
Let's get rid of Simone.

922
00:56:07,398 --> 00:56:09,199
Call the whole thing off.

923
00:56:09,266 --> 00:56:11,736
She'll never keep
her bargain anyway.

924
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:14,905
You're right.

925
00:56:14,972 --> 00:56:18,443
She's even more untrustworthy
than I am.

926
00:56:18,509 --> 00:56:22,212
But thanks to the Hart's
amateur theatrics,

927
00:56:22,279 --> 00:56:23,814
I now have a choice.

928
00:56:27,952 --> 00:56:29,687
What are you doing?

929
00:56:29,754 --> 00:56:31,856
What are you doing?

930
00:56:31,922 --> 00:56:33,958
What are you doing?

931
00:56:34,024 --> 00:56:35,325
Let go of me!

932
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,796
- Pig!
- Now, now, Simone.

933
00:56:38,863 --> 00:56:40,665
We're only trying to help.

934
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:42,433
You bitch!

935
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,669
No!

936
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:47,004
- No!
- Just relax.

937
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:51,141
Your long nightmare is over

938
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,914
and Jennifer Hart's
has just begun.

939
00:57:29,647 --> 00:57:31,982
You! No dogs allowed!

940
00:57:34,852 --> 00:57:37,488
You! Dog! Come back here!

941
00:57:42,593 --> 00:57:45,262
Dr. Gertingen 2965.

942
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:52,670
How you doing Max?

943
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,139
Okay, I guess.

944
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:57,875
Just trying to fly
through the cloud.

945
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:00,811
It's a pretty big one, isn't it?

946
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,248
Pretty big.

947
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,350
Max, I need you to help me

948
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:10,054
because I've never been through
an operation like this either

949
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,457
and I want to be just as brave
as you were yesterday.

950
00:58:13,524 --> 00:58:15,125
I'll help you, Jennifer.

951
00:58:15,192 --> 00:58:16,460
You will?

952
00:58:16,527 --> 00:58:18,462
Thank you.

953
00:58:18,529 --> 00:58:21,131
You know, we had
a very close friend

954
00:58:21,198 --> 00:58:23,500
named Max.

955
00:58:23,568 --> 00:58:25,202
Mmm-hmm.

956
00:58:26,303 --> 00:58:28,438
I met him when I was
in an orphanage

957
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,940
just like you.

958
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:32,276
Mm-hm.

959
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,477
Really.

960
00:58:33,544 --> 00:58:35,846
And you remind us a lot of him.

961
00:58:35,913 --> 00:58:37,882
Mmm-hmm.

962
00:58:37,948 --> 00:58:39,183
Why?

963
00:58:40,885 --> 00:58:42,319
Because...

964
00:58:42,386 --> 00:58:44,254
he saved my life

965
00:58:45,422 --> 00:58:47,391
but in a very different way.

966
00:58:49,093 --> 00:58:51,295
And he was...

967
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:55,032
the bravest and the sweetest
man in the world.

968
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,635
Hello?

969
00:58:59,637 --> 00:59:02,873
Dr. Detmeier, I don't believe
you've met Jennifer Hart.

970
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,309
Hello.

971
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:08,412
- God, that's incredible!
- Yes, we know.

972
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:09,780
Really amazing.

973
00:59:09,847 --> 00:59:13,317
Even the alignment
of the front mandible.

974
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,420
First thing I noticed too.

975
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:21,358
We'll be taking a core marrow sample from
Jennifer, as well as from Maximilian.

976
00:59:21,425 --> 00:59:26,463
We'll run them simultaneously for
one final test of compatibility.

977
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:28,866
Herr Schuler
to physical therapy.

978
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:46,150
Freeway!

979
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:09,273
Put that on her.

980
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:11,275
Go find something
to cover her face.

981
01:00:18,582 --> 01:00:20,951
They boy's got to be taken
to the OR right away.

982
01:00:21,018 --> 01:00:23,020
Freeway! Quick, hide!

983
01:00:27,892 --> 01:00:29,026
Ready, Max?

984
01:00:29,093 --> 01:00:30,227
Ready.

985
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:32,329
Okay, let's go then.

986
01:00:54,184 --> 01:00:56,286
Hi.

987
01:00:56,353 --> 01:00:58,923
I'll be right here
when you wake up.

988
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:02,459
Oh, you look more worried
than I am.

989
01:01:02,526 --> 01:01:03,861
I'm fine.

990
01:01:06,063 --> 01:01:08,999
I've never been
more proud of you

991
01:01:09,066 --> 01:01:11,802
or more in love with you
than I am right now.

992
01:01:12,737 --> 01:01:14,138
Wow.

993
01:01:15,572 --> 01:01:18,408
I should have done this
a long time ago.

994
01:01:38,729 --> 01:01:39,830
Psst.

995
01:01:39,897 --> 01:01:41,398
Psst!

996
01:01:41,465 --> 01:01:42,699
Excuse me, sir.

997
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:45,135
Have you seen a little dog
running around?

998
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:46,203
What kind of a dog?

999
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:47,571
Many kinds,

1000
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:49,339
about this size.

1001
01:01:50,674 --> 01:01:52,376
Where'd you see him last?

1002
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:55,679
That little trespasser was
getting on one of the elevators.

1003
01:02:12,596 --> 01:02:15,399
Where are you, little dog?
Come on.

1004
01:02:25,009 --> 01:02:27,111
Frau Mueller
to cardiology.

1005
01:02:45,629 --> 01:02:46,831
Freeway?

1006
01:02:49,133 --> 01:02:50,334
Hey!

1007
01:02:50,901 --> 01:02:52,236
Hey!

1008
01:03:00,677 --> 01:03:02,947
I'd know that cold, wet nose
anywhere.

1009
01:03:04,748 --> 01:03:06,683
Save the explanations for later.

1010
01:03:18,228 --> 01:03:19,930
Now, Jennifer.

1011
01:03:20,865 --> 01:03:22,699
I see it all went well.

1012
01:03:30,975 --> 01:03:32,809
A perfect match.

1013
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:39,083
Is someone
coming with a key?

1014
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:40,851
Will you open the door?

1015
01:03:40,918 --> 01:03:42,319
Excuse me.

1016
01:03:42,386 --> 01:03:45,222
Come on!

1017
01:03:45,289 --> 01:03:47,757
Jonathan! What are you doing...
What is he doing in here?

1018
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,794
I'm not exactly sure and he's
not talking. How's Jennifer?

1019
01:03:50,861 --> 01:03:53,663
- It went beautifully. She's in recovery.
- Let's go.

1020
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,855
You understand that Jennifer will
be quite druggy for a while.

1021
01:04:21,725 --> 01:04:23,027
Freeway.

1022
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:28,065
Freeway, will you come on?
We're going to see Jennifer.

1023
01:04:31,001 --> 01:04:32,436
Freeway, come on.

1024
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:52,022
It all went very smoothly.

1025
01:04:52,089 --> 01:04:54,091
She just needs to sleep it off.

1026
01:04:57,194 --> 01:04:58,428
Darling.

1027
01:04:58,495 --> 01:05:00,330
I'm here.

1028
01:05:03,968 --> 01:05:05,902
Would it be possible to take
her back to the hotel?

1029
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:09,273
I'm sure she'd feel more
comfortable waking up there.

1030
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:11,441
Well, it's a bit irregular

1031
01:05:11,508 --> 01:05:12,842
but I don't see why not.

1032
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,544
She's in perfect health.

1033
01:05:16,713 --> 01:05:18,915
Freeway doesn't seem to think
much of that idea.

1034
01:05:20,484 --> 01:05:21,986
I don't know what's gotten
into him all of the sudden.

1035
01:05:24,154 --> 01:05:25,789
Freeway, will you pipe down?

1036
01:05:48,045 --> 01:05:50,180
Don't try to talk, darling.

1037
01:05:50,247 --> 01:05:52,849
Everything's going
to be all right.

1038
01:05:52,916 --> 01:05:54,651
- We're going home now.
- Oh...

1039
01:05:54,718 --> 01:05:55,885
Come on.

1040
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,188
Freeway, come on.

1041
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,213
Uh-oh, Toto.

1042
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,348
We're not in Kansas anymore.

1043
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:09,159
Just take it easy,
darling.

1044
01:07:09,226 --> 01:07:10,994
The coffee's on the way up.

1045
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:15,899
Let me explain.

1046
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:18,368
It all started when you called
Mike Tyson a sissy.

1047
01:07:20,804 --> 01:07:22,706
Will you quit that, Freeway?

1048
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:27,977
Let me give you a hint.

1049
01:07:38,622 --> 01:07:40,190
Oh, my God.

1050
01:07:47,964 --> 01:07:50,367
Houston, we have a problem.

1051
01:07:58,408 --> 01:07:59,743
Stay, Freeway.

1052
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:17,927
Honeymoon jitters.

1053
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:34,511
Ah!

1054
01:08:34,578 --> 01:08:35,945
Looking for a woman in pajamas?

1055
01:08:36,012 --> 01:08:38,282
Yeah.

1056
01:08:38,348 --> 01:08:39,649
That way.

1057
01:09:25,962 --> 01:09:27,096
Ahhh!

1058
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:46,983
Where the hell is my wife?

1059
01:10:00,797 --> 01:10:03,633
Don't be afraid to
look over the side.

1060
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,402
You're missing the view.

1061
01:10:05,469 --> 01:10:06,703
When my husband hears
about this...

1062
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:08,004
Your husband?

1063
01:10:08,071 --> 01:10:10,173
I'm off to see him
as soon as we land.

1064
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,376
I intend to ask him for his
cooperation

1065
01:10:12,442 --> 01:10:14,278
and I'm going to need yours too.

1066
01:10:15,078 --> 01:10:16,313
Go to hell.

1067
01:10:18,482 --> 01:10:21,251
Do you know what a body looks like
after it drops a thousand feet?

1068
01:10:21,318 --> 01:10:23,887
Huh? I can drop you
in the water,

1069
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:26,390
make you disappear forever, ja?

1070
01:10:26,456 --> 01:10:29,926
As far as going to hell,
of this there is no doubt.

1071
01:10:31,395 --> 01:10:32,829
But...

1072
01:10:32,896 --> 01:10:34,964
only after I get

1073
01:10:35,031 --> 01:10:36,700
what I want.

1074
01:10:39,102 --> 01:10:41,438
Concierge please.

1075
01:10:41,505 --> 01:10:43,507
This is Jonathan Hart.
I'll need a car right away.

1076
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:45,375
It's open.

1077
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:48,077
Thank you.

1078
01:10:49,112 --> 01:10:51,381
Jonathan, this is too fantastic.

1079
01:10:51,448 --> 01:10:53,082
Do you remember when Jennifer
was joking

1080
01:10:53,149 --> 01:10:54,418
about a secret
passageway to the castle?

1081
01:10:54,484 --> 01:10:56,520
Well, there is one!

1082
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:58,522
I found these old architectural
drawings in the family archives...

1083
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:00,657
- There it is.
- Look, don't bother.

1084
01:11:00,724 --> 01:11:03,860
We're going back to the castle all right,
but we're going through the front door.

1085
01:11:07,964 --> 01:11:08,998
Jennifer.

1086
01:11:09,065 --> 01:11:10,934
I see you're feeling better.

1087
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,336
That's not Jennifer.

1088
01:11:13,337 --> 01:11:14,704
Hello, Peter.

1089
01:11:16,973 --> 01:11:18,308
Simone!

1090
01:11:21,077 --> 01:11:23,980
Are you all right?
What happened?

1091
01:11:24,047 --> 01:11:25,214
Where's Jennifer?

1092
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,650
Karl has her.

1093
01:11:26,716 --> 01:11:28,151
What?

1094
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:29,986
Somehow they switched
them both at the clinic.

1095
01:11:30,754 --> 01:11:33,089
What... What is going on here?

1096
01:11:33,156 --> 01:11:34,791
Tell him, Simone.

1097
01:11:34,858 --> 01:11:36,626
It's time you told
him everything.

1098
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:44,067
I love you, Peter.

1099
01:11:45,402 --> 01:11:49,506
That is why what I'm going to
say is so much more difficult.

1100
01:11:51,074 --> 01:11:52,642
When...

1101
01:11:52,709 --> 01:11:55,178
Karl found me in Provence,

1102
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:57,381
I was in trouble.

1103
01:11:57,447 --> 01:11:59,549
I was broke.

1104
01:11:59,616 --> 01:12:02,085
I was once in prison for fraud.

1105
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:06,823
Karl offered me an arrangement.

1106
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:08,458
An... an arrangement?

1107
01:12:09,526 --> 01:12:11,260
I was supposed to come here,

1108
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,963
make you fall in love with me
and marry you.

1109
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:16,332
But I had to sign a contract

1110
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,234
that if anything
happened to you,

1111
01:12:18,301 --> 01:12:21,237
all my inheritance
would go to Karl.

1112
01:12:21,304 --> 01:12:23,473
Your inheritance?

1113
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:26,009
He was going to pay me
five million dollars.

1114
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:27,877
I don't understand.

1115
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:30,313
If you inherit money from me...

1116
01:12:30,947 --> 01:12:33,483
you'd be dead.

1117
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:36,853
Probably killed in some
accident that Karl arranged.

1118
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:40,457
I'm sure he'd volunteer to deliver
the eulogy at your funeral.

1119
01:12:42,726 --> 01:12:44,661
Oh, my God, Simone.

1120
01:12:44,728 --> 01:12:46,162
Peter...

1121
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:49,766
I didn't realize what Karl
was going to do.

1122
01:12:49,833 --> 01:12:52,035
Or maybe I didn't want
to realize it.

1123
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:56,005
And I didn't know you.
I didn't care for you.

1124
01:12:56,072 --> 01:12:58,942
But... then I met you

1125
01:12:59,008 --> 01:13:01,878
and I fell in love with you,
Peter. I really did.

1126
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:07,717
I told Karl I couldn't
go through with it.

1127
01:13:09,686 --> 01:13:11,054
Do you love me now?

1128
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,922
Oh, Peter...

1129
01:13:12,989 --> 01:13:14,524
I'll only cause you trouble.

1130
01:13:14,591 --> 01:13:16,860
That's not what I asked!

1131
01:13:21,998 --> 01:13:23,066
Yes.

1132
01:13:25,769 --> 01:13:27,136
I'll be right down.

1133
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:30,273
That's Karl. He's in the bar.

1134
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:52,829
I believe my friend is
a connoisseur of...

1135
01:13:52,896 --> 01:13:54,631
beer?

1136
01:13:54,698 --> 01:13:56,232
Nothing, thank you.

1137
01:14:03,907 --> 01:14:05,909
Before you say a word,

1138
01:14:07,877 --> 01:14:10,747
if you've done anything
to harm my wife,

1139
01:14:10,814 --> 01:14:12,516
you know I'll kill you.

1140
01:14:14,984 --> 01:14:16,319
Jonathan...

1141
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:19,055
Such needless animosity.

1142
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:21,491
We each have problems.
I thought we could work

1143
01:14:21,558 --> 01:14:23,426
together to solve them.

1144
01:14:24,728 --> 01:14:26,295
Spit it out, Karl.

1145
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:29,365
All right.

1146
01:14:31,434 --> 01:14:33,670
When I first went to France

1147
01:14:33,737 --> 01:14:36,205
to find this Simone Grohe,

1148
01:14:36,272 --> 01:14:38,542
I discovered she was a hustler,

1149
01:14:40,109 --> 01:14:43,179
specializing in defrauding
wealthy men.

1150
01:14:44,914 --> 01:14:46,349
First I...

1151
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:47,717
I didn't even want to

1152
01:14:47,784 --> 01:14:50,119
tell Peter she existed.

1153
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:53,823
I have a deep affection
for my cousin.

1154
01:14:54,624 --> 01:14:57,193
I didn't want to see him hurt.

1155
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:59,395
There's a violinist
playing outside.

1156
01:14:59,462 --> 01:15:02,098
Perhaps I could arrange for
him to stand behind you.

1157
01:15:04,734 --> 01:15:06,570
The deal I struck

1158
01:15:06,636 --> 01:15:10,373
with Simone was for
Peter's own protection.

1159
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:13,777
She's a common criminal. I couldn't let
her get her hands on all that money.

1160
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:17,480
The temptation for her to do something
harmful to Peter would be too powerful.

1161
01:15:17,547 --> 01:15:18,548
Ja?

1162
01:15:18,615 --> 01:15:20,817
Let me get this straight.

1163
01:15:20,884 --> 01:15:22,752
She's the potential killer?

1164
01:15:24,654 --> 01:15:28,558
I constructed what I thought
was a fool-proof agreement.

1165
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:31,194
If the marriage was happy,

1166
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:33,830
well, all well and good.

1167
01:15:33,897 --> 01:15:36,365
But if something happened
to Peter,

1168
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,467
his money

1169
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,503
would never be her money.

1170
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:43,439
No, it would be yours.

1171
01:15:43,506 --> 01:15:45,341
That is convenient, isn't it?

1172
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:51,214
I have looked after this
inheritance for decades.

1173
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,816
I have guarded Peter's interest.

1174
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:55,284
I have catered to his whims. Do you
think I'm going to let some...

1175
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:58,622
two-bit fortune-hunter destroy
all this

1176
01:15:58,688 --> 01:16:02,025
I don't believe a word
you've said, Karl.

1177
01:16:02,091 --> 01:16:04,160
And I don't give a damn
what the hell happens to you.

1178
01:16:04,227 --> 01:16:06,062
I want my wife back.

1179
01:16:06,529 --> 01:16:07,697
Now.

1180
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:11,901
I do not know where she is.

1181
01:16:13,937 --> 01:16:15,672
Then you're a dead man.

1182
01:16:17,807 --> 01:16:22,211
Somehow I have
the high confidence...

1183
01:16:22,278 --> 01:16:26,149
that you will find her safe
and unharmed...

1184
01:16:34,023 --> 01:16:36,860
As soon as the wedding of Peter

1185
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:38,194
and Simone

1186
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:39,763
is consummated.

1187
01:16:40,964 --> 01:16:41,965
Ja?

1188
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:46,502
Peter is in love. You don't
have to convince him.

1189
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:50,239
And as far as Simone
in concerned...

1190
01:16:50,306 --> 01:16:53,542
I think someone as
successful as you are

1191
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:56,913
can be quite persuasive
when properly

1192
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:58,514
motivated.

1193
01:16:59,883 --> 01:17:01,017
So...

1194
01:17:01,084 --> 01:17:05,521
I have saved a seat of honor
for you at the wedding.

1195
01:17:09,693 --> 01:17:11,260
Please

1196
01:17:11,327 --> 01:17:13,162
do not disappoint me.

1197
01:17:19,035 --> 01:17:20,436
Or Jennifer.

1198
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:30,446
Auf Wiedersehen.

1199
01:17:51,868 --> 01:17:54,938
I know this is the right place.
It's the east side of the castle.

1200
01:17:58,775 --> 01:18:01,077
I mean, it's got to be
here somewhere.

1201
01:18:08,785 --> 01:18:10,019
There it is.

1202
01:18:25,601 --> 01:18:28,037
The Donner family must have put
on a few pounds over the years.

1203
01:18:28,104 --> 01:18:30,206
I can't get through there.
Neither can you.

1204
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,109
I can.

1205
01:18:33,176 --> 01:18:35,344
Darling, you can't
go back in there.

1206
01:18:35,411 --> 01:18:38,014
Besides, according to the plans, there
are several exits inside the castle.

1207
01:18:38,081 --> 01:18:40,149
If you choose the wrong one...

1208
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:42,285
I know where they kept me.

1209
01:18:42,351 --> 01:18:44,620
I will try there first.

1210
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,799
I hope there are no spiders.

1211
01:18:57,233 --> 01:18:58,935
I hate spiders.

1212
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:04,640
Lucky for us, there's no
spiders in Germany.

1213
01:19:04,707 --> 01:19:05,942
What are you talking about?

1214
01:19:06,009 --> 01:19:07,643
Of course there are spiders
in Germany.

1215
01:19:08,812 --> 01:19:10,113
Just checking.

1216
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:52,856
Wow!

1217
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:55,191
It's...

1218
01:19:55,992 --> 01:19:57,360
amazing!

1219
01:19:58,161 --> 01:19:59,996
Fantastic!

1220
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:04,633
Can you open that again?

1221
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,235
I think so.

1222
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:09,005
The control is behind
the Shakespeare.

1223
01:20:09,072 --> 01:20:10,139
Shakespeare.

1224
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:11,975
Shakespeare.

1225
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:17,613
There is no Shakespeare!

1226
01:20:18,114 --> 01:20:19,415
What?

1227
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:29,825
They...

1228
01:20:29,893 --> 01:20:31,494
multiplied...

1229
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:32,795
like rabbits!

1230
01:20:34,063 --> 01:20:36,299
It's no use, Simone.

1231
01:20:36,365 --> 01:20:39,468
Just get into that wedding dress
and no one will get hurt.

1232
01:20:39,535 --> 01:20:41,637
Which one of us
are you talking to?

1233
01:20:42,405 --> 01:20:44,140
Yes...

1234
01:20:44,207 --> 01:20:46,442
Which one of us are you
talking to?

1235
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:50,646
Very clever.

1236
01:20:53,249 --> 01:20:57,186
But you've forgotten one
important detail, Mrs. Hart.

1237
01:20:57,253 --> 01:21:00,056
On your photograph,
there was no beauty mark.

1238
01:21:01,557 --> 01:21:02,691
Ow!

1239
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:05,794
Sorry, Simone.

1240
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:12,801
Nice try,

1241
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:13,970
Mrs. Hart.

1242
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:17,706
Now get into that dress.

1243
01:21:18,841 --> 01:21:20,643
Mrs. Hart's life
depends on it.

1244
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:21,810
I'll be back.

1245
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:27,550
No one ever knew
that wasn't real?

1246
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:29,418
No one ever asked.

1247
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:53,876
Aunt Edna, how beautiful,
sehr schoen... Heinrich!

1248
01:21:53,943 --> 01:21:56,245
Why you don't take Aunt Edna
for a glass of champagne?

1249
01:21:56,312 --> 01:21:58,814
Beautiful hat.
Hurry, take her quick.

1250
01:21:59,682 --> 01:22:02,418
I have a little news for you.

1251
01:22:02,485 --> 01:22:04,887
Simone looks stunning
in her wedding dress

1252
01:22:04,954 --> 01:22:08,024
and by the way, Mrs. Hart
thinks so too.

1253
01:22:10,393 --> 01:22:12,495
And another for me!

1254
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:25,941
How prompt you are, Mr. Hart.

1255
01:22:26,009 --> 01:22:27,776
I wouldn't miss it for
the world if it means

1256
01:22:27,843 --> 01:22:29,278
getting Jennifer back.

1257
01:22:29,345 --> 01:22:33,616
You remember the other day
you advised me to diversify?

1258
01:22:33,682 --> 01:22:35,451
Quite prophetic, Mr. Hart.

1259
01:22:35,518 --> 01:22:37,453
I am now holding both women.

1260
01:22:38,121 --> 01:22:40,123
Don't worry, Mr. Hart.

1261
01:22:40,189 --> 01:22:42,891
I have found the real Simone.

1262
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,693
And if things continue to go
smoothly,

1263
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,729
without interference,

1264
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:48,797
you will find the real Jennifer.

1265
01:22:54,037 --> 01:22:55,771
Nice day for a wedding.

1266
01:23:03,112 --> 01:23:05,514
Well, we tried.

1267
01:23:05,581 --> 01:23:08,117
If you wouldn't mind,
Jonathan...

1268
01:23:08,184 --> 01:23:10,786
now more than ever,
I need a best man.

1269
01:23:18,394 --> 01:23:20,029
Pretty as a picture.

1270
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:28,471
You're about to become
a very wealthy woman...

1271
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:30,106
for a while.

1272
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,675
Take her downstairs.

1273
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:34,910
I have some business to conduct

1274
01:23:34,977 --> 01:23:36,145
with Mrs. Hart.

1275
01:24:25,128 --> 01:24:26,429
Dearly beloved.

1276
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,532
We are gathered here...

1277
01:24:30,599 --> 01:24:32,968
to join these two people

1278
01:24:33,035 --> 01:24:35,738
in holy, wedded matrimony.

1279
01:24:37,873 --> 01:24:40,042
I'm truly sorry about all this,

1280
01:24:40,609 --> 01:24:42,478
Mrs. Hart.

1281
01:24:42,545 --> 01:24:45,381
If only you hadn't tried
to interfere.

1282
01:24:47,150 --> 01:24:48,884
Elsa...

1283
01:24:48,951 --> 01:24:51,520
you are making
a terrible mistake.

1284
01:24:53,556 --> 01:24:55,524
Karl will be furious!

1285
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:57,426
Will you stop that fake accent?

1286
01:24:58,894 --> 01:25:00,763
You final words...

1287
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:02,498
should be in your own voice.

1288
01:25:03,332 --> 01:25:04,700
Elsa!

1289
01:25:04,767 --> 01:25:06,802
When we first met, you...

1290
01:25:06,869 --> 01:25:09,071
you were wearing a scarf
that was given to you

1291
01:25:09,138 --> 01:25:10,673
by your grandmother.

1292
01:25:10,739 --> 01:25:13,008
We went to lunch at the
Extra Black.

1293
01:25:13,075 --> 01:25:14,443
You were very sick.

1294
01:25:15,278 --> 01:25:17,313
Listen to me, Elsa!

1295
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:21,217
Right now, downstairs, Peter
is marrying Jennifer Hart.

1296
01:25:29,425 --> 01:25:31,126
Help me!

1297
01:25:31,194 --> 01:25:32,661
Help me!

1298
01:25:34,363 --> 01:25:35,764
No! Leave me!

1299
01:25:35,831 --> 01:25:37,800
Find her! Kill her!

1300
01:25:49,712 --> 01:25:51,947
If there is anyone here...

1301
01:25:52,014 --> 01:25:55,083
who has just cause
as to why these two people

1302
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,553
should not be bound together

1303
01:25:57,620 --> 01:25:58,854
in holy matrimony

1304
01:25:58,921 --> 01:26:00,556
let them speak now

1305
01:26:00,623 --> 01:26:03,091
or forever hold their peace.

1306
01:26:18,807 --> 01:26:20,743
Well, I object.

1307
01:26:24,247 --> 01:26:26,749
I cannot marry this man

1308
01:26:27,783 --> 01:26:29,352
because I'm already married

1309
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:31,620
to this man.

1310
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:36,124
Peter!

1311
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,192
Peter!

1312
01:26:50,906 --> 01:26:52,808
Help! Help!

1313
01:26:57,580 --> 01:26:59,682
I'll never forget you.

1314
01:27:02,818 --> 01:27:04,320
I'll be right back.

1315
01:27:04,387 --> 01:27:05,454
Me too.

1316
01:27:17,533 --> 01:27:18,934
Mr. Hart!

1317
01:27:19,001 --> 01:27:20,903
Prepare to defend yourself!

1318
01:27:54,169 --> 01:27:56,004
Damn it! Dummkopf.

1319
01:27:56,071 --> 01:27:57,172
Aunt Edna!

1320
01:27:59,174 --> 01:28:00,208
You?

1321
01:28:01,577 --> 01:28:02,678
Uh-huh.

1322
01:28:02,745 --> 01:28:04,413
Atta way, Rocky.

1323
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:06,148
Hmm...

1324
01:28:06,214 --> 01:28:08,817
Now let me see,
the face is familiar.

1325
01:28:08,884 --> 01:28:10,686
Let me figure this out.

1326
01:28:10,753 --> 01:28:12,388
Scaramouch?

1327
01:28:12,455 --> 01:28:14,056
Zorro?

1328
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:15,858
Speaking of familiar faces,

1329
01:28:15,924 --> 01:28:18,527
how are we gonna get rid
of that beauty mark?

1330
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:24,533
Just show me to a hot tub and some clean
sheets and you can figure it out.

1331
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,601
Hmm...

1332
01:28:33,376 --> 01:28:35,578
If there's
anyone here...

1333
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:38,881
who has just cause
as to why these people

1334
01:28:38,947 --> 01:28:40,282
should not be bound

1335
01:28:40,349 --> 01:28:41,950
in holy matrimony,

1336
01:28:42,017 --> 01:28:43,486
let them speak now

1337
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:45,488
or forever

1338
01:28:45,554 --> 01:28:46,989
hold their peace.

1339
01:28:55,263 --> 01:28:57,132
Why is everyone looking at me?

1340
01:29:00,068 --> 01:29:01,470
I now pronounce you...

1341
01:29:02,237 --> 01:29:04,607
husbands and wives.

1342
01:29:05,508 --> 01:29:06,509
Yes!

1343
01:29:15,784 --> 01:29:17,052
Jennifer?

1344
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:19,021
Yes, Max?

1345
01:29:19,087 --> 01:29:21,524
I told you you were gonna
save my life.

1346
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:24,493
Yes, we're going to take
very good care of that life.

1347
01:29:28,664 --> 01:29:30,165
Mrs. Strauss...

1348
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:34,069
Another Freeway!

1349
01:29:39,775 --> 01:29:42,978
We thought you needed
a permanent copilot.

1350
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:44,547
Oh, wow!

1351
01:29:56,859 --> 01:29:59,161
Well, Peter,
it's been an experience.

1352
01:30:00,162 --> 01:30:01,296
Simone...

1353
01:30:05,033 --> 01:30:07,302
I feel as if I'm saying
goodbye to myself.

1354
01:30:07,369 --> 01:30:10,906
If it had to be someone,
Jennifer, I'm glad it was you.

1355
01:30:10,973 --> 01:30:12,040
Thank you.

1356
01:30:18,481 --> 01:30:19,915
Amazing.

1357
01:30:22,485 --> 01:30:24,953
That must be the car
to take us to the airport.

1358
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:35,097
Mr. and Mrs. Hart...

1359
01:30:35,163 --> 01:30:39,101
You're in plenty of time to get to the
airport before your plane leaves.

1360
01:30:43,472 --> 01:30:44,940
Was ist los?

1361
01:30:45,007 --> 01:30:46,074
Los?

1362
01:30:46,742 --> 01:30:47,876
Nothing.

1363
01:30:49,945 --> 01:30:51,379
You know...

1364
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:53,215
It's such a nice day.

1365
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:56,018
Why don't we just walk
to the airport?

1366
01:30:59,387 --> 01:31:00,989
What a good idea, darling.

1367
01:31:03,158 --> 01:31:04,793
I'm right behind you,

1368
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:06,194
all the way.
