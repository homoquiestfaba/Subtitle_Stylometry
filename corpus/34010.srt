1
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,688
Somebody asked me today...

2
00:00:56,764 --> 00:01:00,200
"Phil, if you could be anywhere,
where would you like to be?"

3
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:03,032
I said to him,
"Probably right here. "

4
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,369
Elko Nevada.
Our nation's high at 79 today.

5
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,205
In California,
they'll have warm weather tomorrow...

6
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,041
gang wars and some
very overpriced real estate.

7
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:17,016
Up in the Pacific Northwest,
they'll have some very tall trees.

8
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:19,986
It will be clear across
the Rockies and the Great Plains.

9
00:01:20,054 --> 00:01:22,045
But look out,
here comes trouble.

10
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:28,225
Oh, boy!
Front coming our way. Look out.

11
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,389
What will that mean to us
In the Three Rivers area?

12
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:34,196
One of these big blue things!
This cold, frigid, Arctic air.

13
00:01:34,268 --> 00:01:36,202
This big mass out of the north.

14
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,400
It will meet up with all this moisture
coming out of the Gulf...

15
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,035
mix together at high altitudes
and cause some snow.

16
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:48,413
It won't hit us here in Pittsburgh.
It will push off and hit Altoona.

17
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,075
Close call.

18
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,244
Let's take a look
at the five-day.

19
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,756
Nothing to be too scared about.

20
00:01:55,823 --> 00:01:59,589
Bundle up warm,
but leave your galoshes at home.

21
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,424
I won't be here for the 10:00.

22
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,761
Tomorrow is Groundhog Day,
and I'm going out to Punxsutawney...

23
00:02:04,832 --> 00:02:07,426
for our country's
oldest groundhog festival.

24
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,938
According to the legend,
tomorrow, February 2...

25
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:14,941
If the groundhog sees his shadow,
we'll have six more weeks of winter.

26
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,603
- Keep your fingers crossed.
- Sounds like a lot of fun.

27
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:21,445
This is your third year in a row
isn't it?

28
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,949
Four, Nan.

29
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,618
Thanks, Phil.

30
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:30,283
Up next: Diane Kingman looks
at sex and violence in the movies.

31
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,791
Stay with us.

32
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,824
- We're clear.
- Have fun in Punxsutawney.

33
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,300
For your information, Hairdo..

34
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,963
there is a major network
interested in me.

35
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:47,132
That would be
the Home Shopping Network

36
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,303
Thanks, Larry.
Go wait in the van.

37
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,973
That was nice.
"Big trees."

38
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:58,144
Stop, Henny.
Can you handle the 10:00 or not?

39
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,985
If you don't want to rush back,
I can do the 5:00 tomorrow.

40
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:05,492
I want to stay an extra second
in Punxsutawney?. Please!

41
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,826
Rita thinks it would be great to stay
for some of the other events...

42
00:03:09,897 --> 00:03:11,592
get some incredible footage.

43
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,328
The people and the fun,
the excitement.

44
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,565
You haven't worked with her yet
She's really nice.

45
00:03:17,638 --> 00:03:20,072
She's gonna be a really good producer.

46
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,710
You guys will have fun.

47
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:30,577
She's fun, but not my kind of fun.
I will be here for the 5:00. Rita.

48
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,747
Can you keep a secret Larry?

49
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,250
I'm probably leaving PBH.

50
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:41,846
So this will be the last time
we do the Groundhog together.

51
00:04:41,923 --> 00:04:45,415
What's wrong
with the Groundhog Festival?

52
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:50,556
I n San Diego, I covered the swallows
returning to Capistrano six years.

53
00:04:50,631 --> 00:04:53,259
Someday somebody will see me
Interviewing a groundhog...

54
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,427
and think I don't have a future.

55
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,937
I think it's a nice story.

56
00:04:58,005 --> 00:05:00,769
He comes out,
and he looks around.

57
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,778
He wrinkles up his little nose.
He sees his shadow or he doesn't see lt.

58
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,110
It's nice. People like lt.

59
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:10,116
You are new, aren't you?

60
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,243
People like blood sausage too.

61
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,015
People are morons.

62
00:05:14,088 --> 00:05:16,283
Nice attitude.

63
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:20,794
Look in the mirror and see what you
look like doing that groundhog thing.

64
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,295
For me? Once?

65
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:26,459
He comes out
and looks at his little shadow.

66
00:05:27,902 --> 00:05:31,668
- Would you like some blood sausage?
- I like blood sausage.

67
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,196
Rita, I can't stay here.

68
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:36,703
- Prima donna.
- I'll handle lt. What's the matter?.

69
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,535
I hate this place. I stayed here
two years ago I was miserable.

70
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:43,441
- It's a fleabag. I'm not staying here.
- You're not staying here.

71
00:06:43,511 --> 00:06:45,638
I'm not?

72
00:06:45,713 --> 00:06:49,171
Larry's dropping me off. I booked you
in a nice bed-and-breakfast.

73
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:56,720
Great. I think this is the trait
of a really good producer:.

74
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,486
Keep the talent happy.

75
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,186
Anything I can do

76
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:03,253
Would you help me
with my pelvic tilt?

77
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,395
Within reason.

78
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,526
Would you like to have dinner
with Larry and me?

79
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:11,730
No, thank you.
I've seen Larry eat.

80
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:17,076
Get your sleep,
I'll see you in the morning.

81
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,447
Don't be late.

82
00:07:21,582 --> 00:07:24,244
Did he actually
call himself "the talent"?

83
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,314
Okay, campers, rise and shine.

84
00:07:54,382 --> 00:07:57,283
Don't forget your booties
because it's cold out there today.

85
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:00,286
It's cold out there everyday.
What is this, Miami Beach?

86
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:05,951
Not hardly.. You can expect hazardous
travel later with that blizzard thing..

87
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,622
"That blizzard thing."?
Here's the report..

88
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:13,292
The National Weather Service
is calling. for a hig blizzard thing..

89
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:17,303
They are. But there's another reason
why today is especially exciting..

90
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,134
Especially cold.

91
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:21,265
The hig question
on everybody's lips--

92
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:24,800
On their chapped lips.

93
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,814
Do you think Phil will come out
and see his shadow?

94
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,646
- Punxsutawney Phil.
- That's right, woodchuck chuckers.

95
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,811
It's Groundhog Day!

96
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:38,120
- Get up and check that hog!
- Come here, groundhog!

97
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,494
Good morning.

98
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,655
- You off to see the groundhog?
- I am.

99
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,995
Do you think
It will be an early spring?

100
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,831
I'm predicting March 21 .

101
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,996
Good guess.

102
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,473
I think that actually is
the first day of spring.

103
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:03,512
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

104
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,518
I slept alone, Mrs. Lancaster.

105
00:09:06,954 --> 00:09:09,855
- Would you like some coffee?
- Is there any possibility...

106
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,859
of getting an espresso
or a cappuccino this morning?

107
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,361
I really don't know.

108
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,522
How to spell "espresso"
or "cappuccino"

109
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,190
This looks fine.

110
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:22,702
- I hope you enjoy the festivities.
- I'm sure I will.

111
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,931
There's talk of a blizzard.

112
00:09:25,005 --> 00:09:28,702
We may catch a break
and have that blizzard blow by us.

113
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,210
All this moisture coming up
out of the south...

114
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:33,712
will probably push on
east of us.

115
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:37,217
At high altitudes it will crystallize
and give us what we call snow.

116
00:09:37,284 --> 00:09:38,876
Probably will be some accumulation...

117
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,787
but here in Punxsutawney our high
will be about 30 today, teens tonight.

118
00:09:42,857 --> 00:09:46,793
Chance of precipitation
about 20 percent today and tomorrow.

119
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:49,955
Did you want to talk about the weather
or were you just making chitchat?

120
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:54,228
- Chitchat.
- See you later.

121
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:58,533
- Bye.
- Will you be checking out today?.

122
00:09:58,606 --> 00:10:01,734
Chance of departure today:.
100 percent.

123
00:10:24,231 --> 00:10:27,029
Phil Connors?
I thought that was you!

124
00:10:27,101 --> 00:10:29,433
How you doing?
Thanks for watching.

125
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:34,167
Don't tell me you don't remember me.
I sure as heck-fire remember you.

126
00:10:35,242 --> 00:10:40,839
- Not a chance.
- Ned Ryerson!

127
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,373
Needlenose Ned.
Ned the Head.

128
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,010
Come on, buddy.
Case Western High.

129
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:51,114
I did the whistling belly button trick
at the high school talent show. Bing!

130
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:55,253
Got the shingles real bad senloryear,
almost didn't graduate.

131
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:57,422
Bing again!

132
00:10:57,498 --> 00:11:01,696
I dated your sister Mary Pat
till you told me not to anymore.

133
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,443
Did you turn pro
with that belly button thing or what?

134
00:11:11,512 --> 00:11:13,980
- I sell insurance.
- What a shock.

135
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:17,711
Do you have life insurance?
You could always use a little more.

136
00:11:17,785 --> 00:11:21,084
Am I right or am I right
or am I right? Right?

137
00:11:21,155 --> 00:11:26,991
I would love to stand here and talk
with you, but I'm not going to.

138
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:30,326
- See you.
- I'll walk with you.

139
00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:33,332
Whenever I see an opportunity now,
I charge it like a bull.

140
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,493
Ned the Bull, that's me now.

141
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:39,505
I have friends who live and die
by the actuarial tables.

142
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,508
It's all one big crapshoot.

143
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,840
Have you ever heard
of single premium life?

144
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,676
I think that really could be
the ticket for you.

145
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:52,185
God!
It is so good to see you!

146
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,188
- What are you doing for dinner?.
- Something else.

147
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,692
It's been great seeing you,
Needlehead. Take care.

148
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:06,358
Watch out for that first step,
It's a doozy!

149
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:16,542
Srike up the music
The band has begun

150
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,046
The Pennsylvania Polka

151
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:24,380
Pick out your partner
and join in the fun

152
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:31,853
It started in Scranton
It's now number one

153
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:34,758
It's gonna entertain you

154
00:12:36,463 --> 00:12:38,328
Phil, over here!

155
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,060
Where have you been?

156
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:44,230
It was horrible.
A giant leech got me.

157
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,069
You're missing all the fun.
These people are great.

158
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,235
Some have been parthing all night.
They sing until they get too cold...

159
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:55,248
then they sit by the fire,
get warm and sing some more.

160
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,418
They're hicks, Rita.

161
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:03,923
Did you sleep okay without me?
You tossed and turned, didn't you?

162
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,824
- You're incredible.
- Who told you?

163
00:13:06,894 --> 00:13:10,091
It's groundhog time.

164
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,730
On me in three.

165
00:13:15,803 --> 00:13:17,668
Two, one.

166
00:13:17,738 --> 00:13:23,438
Once a year, the eyes of the nation turn
to this tiny Pennsylvania hamlet...

167
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,444
to watch a master at work

168
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:28,106
The master?.
Punxsutawney Phil...

169
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:31,618
the world's most famous weatherman,
the groundhog...

170
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:35,951
who, as legend has it, can predict
the coming of an early spring.

171
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:41,086
The question we have to ask ourselves
today is, "Does Phil feel lucky?".

172
00:13:43,097 --> 00:13:44,621
Then it's the same old schtick.

173
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,462
The guy with the big stick
raps on the door.

174
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:50,469
They pull the little rat out.
They talk to him.

175
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:53,836
The rat talks back and then
they tell us what's gonna happen.

176
00:13:59,947 --> 00:14:02,472
Isn't he cute?

177
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,517
You like your guys
with prominent upper teeth?

178
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:21,994
"This February 2,
at 7:20 and 30 seconds...

179
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:25,505
Punxsutawney Phil,
the seer of seers...

180
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:28,632
prognosticator
of prognosticators...

181
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:32,145
emerged reluctantly,
but alertly...

182
00:14:32,212 --> 00:14:34,407
In Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania...

183
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:37,348
and stated in Groundhogs...

184
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,716
'I definitely see a shadow.'"

185
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:46,389
Sorry, folks.
Six more weeks of winter.

186
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:55,861
On me in three. Two, one.

187
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:59,702
Television really falls to capture
the true excitement...

188
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:03,038
of a large squirrel
predicting the weather.

189
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,203
I, for one, am very grateful
to have been here.

190
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,340
From Punxsutawney,
this is Phil Connors. So long.

191
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,884
Want to try it again
without the sarcasm?

192
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,216
We got lt.
I'm out of here.

193
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,052
Prima donnas.

194
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,368
Boy, take a look at this.

195
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,534
- What is going on?
- I don't know.

196
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,340
Perhaps it's that giant blizzard
we're not supposed to get.

197
00:15:39,413 --> 00:15:41,074
This is impossible.

198
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,445
Nobody honks this horn but me, pal.

199
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:09,341
Take this rig out of here.

200
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,435
Commander, what's going on?

201
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,572
There's nothing going on.
We're closing the road.

202
00:16:14,648 --> 00:16:18,414
- Big blizzard moving in.
- What blizzard? It's a couple flake.

203
00:16:18,485 --> 00:16:21,352
Don't you listen to the weather?.
We got a major storm here.

204
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:23,616
I make the weather!

205
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,124
All this moisture coming up
out of the Gulf...

206
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,753
will push off to the east
and hit Altoona.

207
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:31,457
Pal, you got that moisture
on your head.

208
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:36,128
You can go back to Punxsutawney
or you can freeze to death.

209
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,639
It's your choice.
What's It gonna be?

210
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,733
I'm thinking.

211
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,473
All the long-distance lines
are down?

212
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:53,311
What about the satellite?
is it snowing in space?

213
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:58,984
Don't you have a line you keep open
for emergencies or for celebrities?

214
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,995
I'm both.
I'm a celebrity in an emergency.

215
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,497
Can you patch me through
on that line, please?

216
00:17:12,472 --> 00:17:14,497
Can I have one more
with booze in it?

217
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:18,335
I like it here.

218
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:22,178
Phil, are you going
to the groundhog dinner?.

219
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,013
I had groundhog for lunch.
It wasn't bad.

220
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,645
Tastes like chicken.
You two run along.

221
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,686
Looking foxy tonight, man.

222
00:17:31,758 --> 00:17:34,852
Is your troop seIling cookies
again this year?.

223
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,294
That's so funny, Phil.

224
00:17:37,364 --> 00:17:38,991
What are you gonna do?

225
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:42,695
I'm going back to my room
and take a hot shower.

226
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:45,670
Maybe read Hustler
or something.

227
00:17:45,739 --> 00:17:47,172
Suit yourself.

228
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,712
God!

229
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:08,386
Yo, Mom.
Isn't there any hot water?.

230
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,056
There wouldn't be today.

231
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,895
Of course not.
SIlly me.

232
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,400
Sweet dreams.

233
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,262
Nice going, boys.
You're playing yesterday's tape.

234
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,955
Chapped lips.

235
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,766
What the hell?

236
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:40,653
Good morning.
Off to see the groundhog?

237
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,315
Think it will be an early spring?

238
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,824
Didn't we do this yesterday?.

239
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:48,156
I don't know what you mean.

240
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,492
Don't mess with me, Pork Chop,

241
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:55,661
- What day is this?
- It's February 2. Groundhog Day.

242
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,499
I thought it was yesterday.

243
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,358
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

244
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,367
Did I sleep well?

245
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:33,202
- Would you like some coffee?
- Please. I think I'll have a double.

246
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:36,037
I hope you enjoy the festivities.

247
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,373
There's talk of a blizzard.

248
00:20:40,947 --> 00:20:43,381
Do you ever have deja vu?

249
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,385
I don't think so,
but I could check with the kitchen.

250
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,387
That's okay. Thank you.

251
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,556
Will you be checking out today?.

252
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:58,564
I'd say the chance of departure
is 80 percent.

253
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,601
Seventy-five, eighty.

254
00:21:06,773 --> 00:21:08,832
Excuse me.

255
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:11,673
Where is everybody going?

256
00:21:11,745 --> 00:21:15,181
To Gobbler's Knob.
It's Groundhog Day.

257
00:21:15,248 --> 00:21:17,910
It's still just once a year,
isn't it?

258
00:21:30,096 --> 00:21:33,429
Phil Connors.
I thought that was you.

259
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:39,738
Don't you say you don't remember me.
I sure as heck-fire remember you.

260
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,437
Ned Ryerson?

261
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:46,104
Bing!
First shot right out of the box!

262
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:49,114
How's It going, old buddy?.

263
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,117
Actually, I'm not feeling well.
Would you excuse me?

264
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,619
It's funny
you should mention your health.

265
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,452
You will never guess what I do now.

266
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:00,618
- Do you sell insurance?
- Bing again!

267
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,753
You are sharp as a tack today.

268
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:07,459
Do you have life insurance?
if you do, you could always use more.

269
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,627
Right?
Who couldn't?

270
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:15,300
You know something?
I got a feeling you ain't got any.

271
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:19,835
- Am I right or am I right?
- I gotta go

272
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:27,812
Watch out for that first step,
It's a doozy.

273
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:55,013
Phil, over here!

274
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,014
- Where have you been?
- Rita, do me a favor.

275
00:23:00,086 --> 00:23:03,351
I need someone to give me
a good hard slap in the face.

276
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,416
- How's that?
- Good.

277
00:23:07,494 --> 00:23:11,362
If you need help with the other cheek,
let me know. I'm right here.

278
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,198
- Something's going on.
- Are you drunk or something?

279
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:19,864
Drunk's more fun.
Can I be serious for a minute?

280
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,205
- I don't know. Can you?
- I'm being serious.

281
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:27,337
I'm having a problem.
I may be having a problem.

282
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:32,343
- It's groundhog time.
- I knew you would say that.

283
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:36,048
I really feel weird.

284
00:23:36,122 --> 00:23:38,522
Let's just do this,
then we'll talk.

285
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,322
On me in three.

286
00:23:42,395 --> 00:23:44,295
Two, one.

287
00:23:44,364 --> 00:23:48,391
It's Groundhog Day again.

288
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:52,734
That must mean we're at Gobbler's Knob
waiting for the forecast...

289
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,400
from the world's most famous
groundhog weatherman...

290
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,067
Punxsutawney Phil...

291
00:23:57,143 --> 00:24:00,738
who's just about to tell us
how much more winter we can expect.

292
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,143
This is a riot.

293
00:24:11,591 --> 00:24:12,888
Isn't he cute?

294
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:38,941
Yeah, Sport,
I know there's a blizzard.

295
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,284
When are the long-distance lines
gonna be repaired?

296
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:47,793
What if there is no tomorrow?
There wasn't one today.

297
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,129
Hello?

298
00:25:45,251 --> 00:25:48,015
Good morning.
Off to see the groundhog?

299
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,751
Did you sleep well, Mr.--

300
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,211
I thought--

301
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:18,046
Don't say you don't remember me.
I sure as heck-fire remember you.

302
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,382
It's me, Ned Ryerson!

303
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:23,081
Needlenose Ned. Ned the Head.
Come on, buddy. Case Western--

304
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,858
Over here!

305
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:34,388
- Where have you been?
- Can we talk about a nonwork matter?.

306
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,402
- You never talk about work
- We really have to talk. Come on.

307
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,735
- It's a creative meeting. Forget lt.
- Walt a second. We've got work to do

308
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:43,571
I don't.
I've already done it twice.

309
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:46,578
When you get finished,
meet me in the diner.

310
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:52,243
- What's that all about?
- I don't know.

311
00:26:52,318 --> 00:26:54,047
Prima donnas.

312
00:26:57,123 --> 00:26:58,556
More coffee, hon?

313
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:00,422
No, thanks.
Just the check, please.

314
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:04,259
- These sticky buns are heaven.
- Aren't they?.

315
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,259
Just put that anywhere, pal.

316
00:27:08,334 --> 00:27:09,767
Good save.

317
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:14,898
Tell me why you're too sick to work,
and it better be good.

318
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:21,273
I'm reliving the same day
over and over.

319
00:27:21,347 --> 00:27:24,282
Groundhog Day. Today.

320
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,284
I'm waiting for the punch line.

321
00:27:26,352 --> 00:27:30,789
Really.
This is the third time.

322
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,848
It's like yesterday never happened.

323
00:27:32,926 --> 00:27:37,056
I am racking my brain, but I can't
imagine why you'd make this up,

324
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:40,725
I'm not making it up,
I am asking you for help!

325
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,200
What do you want me to do?

326
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:46,727
I don't know! You're a producer,
come up with something.

327
00:27:46,806 --> 00:27:48,330
You want my advice?

328
00:27:48,408 --> 00:27:53,311
You should get your head examined
if you expect me to believe that story.

329
00:27:53,379 --> 00:27:55,176
Like the groundhog Phil?

330
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,951
Look out for your shadow, pal.

331
00:28:01,821 --> 00:28:03,721
Morons, your bus is leaving.

332
00:28:04,791 --> 00:28:07,589
You guys ready?.
We better get going...

333
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,652
- to stay ahead of the weather.
- Let's talk back in Pittsburgh.

334
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,255
I'm not going back to Pittsburgh.

335
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,767
- Why not?
- Because of the blizzard.

336
00:28:15,835 --> 00:28:18,167
You said that would hit Altoona.

337
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:21,833
I know that's what I said.

338
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,672
I think you need help,

339
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:27,838
That's what I've been saying.
I need help,

340
00:28:29,415 --> 00:28:32,009
No spots, no clots...

341
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:35,020
no tumors, no lesions....

342
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,851
no aneurysms.

343
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,857
None that I can see.

344
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:42,691
If you want a CAT scan or an MRI,
you have to go into Pittsburgh.

345
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,196
I can't go into Pittsburgh.

346
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:48,530
- Why can't you go into Pittsburgh?
- There's a blizzard.

347
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,535
Right. The blizzard.

348
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,868
You know what you may need,
Mr. Connors?

349
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,874
A biopsy.

350
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,375
A psychiatrist.

351
00:28:58,745 --> 00:29:03,182
That's an unusual problem,
Mr. Connors.

352
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:08,182
Most of my work is
with couples, families.

353
00:29:08,254 --> 00:29:09,687
I have an alcoholic now.

354
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:16,228
You went to college, right?
It wasn't veterinary psychology, was it?

355
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:19,732
Didn't you take some course
that covered this stuff?.

356
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,393
Sort of. I guess.

357
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,668
Abnormal psychology.

358
00:29:25,738 --> 00:29:30,471
So, what do I do?

359
00:29:30,543 --> 00:29:32,602
I think we should meet again.

360
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,580
How's tomorrow for you?

361
00:29:38,284 --> 00:29:39,717
Is that not good?

362
00:29:50,496 --> 00:29:53,431
I was in the Virgin Islands once.

363
00:29:53,499 --> 00:29:55,592
I met a girl.

364
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:59,434
We ate lobster,
drank pina coladas.

365
00:29:59,505 --> 00:30:02,133
At sunset,
we made love like sea otters.

366
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,439
That was a pretty good day.

367
00:30:08,514 --> 00:30:14,180
Why couldn't I get that day
over and over and over?.

368
00:30:14,253 --> 00:30:17,120
You know, some guys
would look at this glass...

369
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,125
and they would say,
"That glass is half empty."

370
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:23,959
Other guys would say,
"That glass is half full."

371
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,625
I peg you as a "glass is half empty"
kind of guy. Am I right?

372
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:33,135
What would you do
if you were stuck in one place...

373
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:37,142
and every day was exactly the same,
and nothing that you did mattered?

374
00:30:39,545 --> 00:30:42,480
That sums it up for me.

375
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,820
Good luck.
I'll drop you off.

376
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:59,763
-This thing sticks. You gotta jiggle lt.
-Come on up here.

377
00:30:59,832 --> 00:31:03,996
- My gosh.
- Give me your keys, pal.

378
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:08,006
Friends don't let friends drive.
Stand up here. Take a deep breath.

379
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,008
You feel okay?. Really?.

380
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,509
You're all right.

381
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:21,019
You want to throw up here
or in the car?.

382
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:26,150
- I think both.
- Come on.

383
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,368
I don't think I should be driving.

384
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,702
I don't either.
Watch your head.

385
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,037
Watch your knees.
Don't break anything.

386
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:46,442
All right.
Let's not forget seat belts.

387
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,542
Who else could go
for some flapjacks right now?

388
00:31:56,556 --> 00:31:58,717
Let me ask you guys a question.

389
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:03,057
- Shoot.
- What if there were no tomorrow?

390
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:07,065
No tomorrow? That would mean
there would be no consequences.

391
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:11,467
There would be no hangovers.
We could do whatever we wanted!

392
00:32:12,638 --> 00:32:17,405
That's true.
We could do whatever we want.

393
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:26,645
If we wanted to hit mailboxes,
we could let Ralph drive!

394
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,257
- I think they want you to stop,
- Hang on.

395
00:32:41,801 --> 00:32:44,031
It's the same thing
your whole life:.

396
00:32:44,103 --> 00:32:47,402
"Clean up your room." "Stand up
straight." "Pick up your feet."

397
00:32:47,473 --> 00:32:52,001
"Take it like a man."
"Be nice to your sister."

398
00:32:52,078 --> 00:32:54,603
"Don't mix beer and wine, ever."

399
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,616
"Don't drive
on the railroad tracks."

400
00:32:58,684 --> 00:33:01,482
Phil, that's one
I happen to agree with.

401
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,297
I don't know, Gus.

402
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:18,861
Sometimes I think you just have
to take the big chances.

403
00:33:18,938 --> 00:33:21,429
This is the police!
Pullover immediately!

404
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:24,938
We're talking in here.

405
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,108
I'm betting he'll swerve first.

406
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:49,633
I'm not gonna live
by their rules anymore.

407
00:33:49,702 --> 00:33:54,196
- I noticed that.
- You make choices and live with them.

408
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:09,911
My knee.

409
00:34:12,758 --> 00:34:14,692
Let me handle this.

410
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:20,028
Three cheeseburgers,
two large fries...

411
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,192
two chocolate shake
and one large Coke.

412
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:26,500
- And some flapjacks.
- Too early for flapjacks?

413
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,389
Rise and shine, campers!

414
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,221
Don't forget your booties
because it's cold out there today!

415
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:52,424
It's cold out there every day.
What is this, Miami Beach? Not hardly.

416
00:34:56,802 --> 00:34:58,565
Slept like a baby .
Thank you.

417
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,232
- I'd love some of your coffee.
- I hope--

418
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:05,073
Flurries moving in later, but
the blizzard will hit outside of town.

419
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:08,739
Mrs. Lancaster, was anybody
looking for me here this morning?

420
00:35:08,814 --> 00:35:13,080
Perhaps a state official?
Maybe a blue hat, gun, nightstick?

421
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,746
No one like that.
will there be?

422
00:35:15,821 --> 00:35:17,254
Apparently not.

423
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:22,753
Hold my room for me, please.
I'm staying an extra day.

424
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:30,825
Catch you tomorrow, Pops.

425
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:13,307
I like to see a man of advancing years
throwing caution to the wind.

426
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:16,473
It's inspiring, in a way.

427
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,109
My years are not advancing
as fast as you might think.

428
00:36:19,185 --> 00:36:20,618
More coffee, hon?

429
00:36:20,686 --> 00:36:22,449
Just keep It coming, please.

430
00:36:22,521 --> 00:36:23,954
Sure thing.

431
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,319
Just put that anywhere, pal.

432
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,827
Good save.

433
00:36:31,897 --> 00:36:35,560
Don't you worry about cholesterol,
lung cancer, love handles?

434
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,568
I don't worry
about anything anymore.

435
00:36:39,638 --> 00:36:42,402
What make you so special?
Everybody worries about something.

436
00:36:42,475 --> 00:36:47,469
That's exactly what make me so special.
I don't even have to floss.

437
00:36:56,722 --> 00:36:58,155
What?

438
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:03,957
"The wretch,
concentered all in self...

439
00:37:04,029 --> 00:37:06,497
Living,
shall forfeit fair renown...

440
00:37:06,565 --> 00:37:09,830
And, doubly dying,
shall go down...

441
00:37:09,902 --> 00:37:13,201
To the vile dust,
from whence he sprung...

442
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:17,333
Unwept, unhonor'd, and unsung."

443
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:19,877
Sir Walter Scott.

444
00:37:22,848 --> 00:37:26,716
- You don't like poetry?.
- I love poetry.

445
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:30,222
I just thought that was Willard Scott.
I was confused.

446
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:33,053
Do you think I'm acting like this
because I'm egocentric?

447
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:36,390
I know you're egocentric.
It's your defining characteristic.

448
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:42,226
Are you guys ready?. We better get going
to stay ahead of the weather.

449
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:46,067
Thanks, Larry.
Would you like a doggie bag?

450
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:50,074
- I'll stay here and finish.
- I thought you hated this town.

451
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:53,236
It's beginning to grow on me.

452
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,870
Larry, quit staring.

453
00:37:54,947 --> 00:37:56,574
These are excellent.

454
00:38:08,627 --> 00:38:11,926
Did you see the groundhog
this morning?

455
00:38:11,997 --> 00:38:14,431
I never miss lt.

456
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,434
What's your name?

457
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,101
Nancy Taylor.
And you are?

458
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,936
- What high school did you go to?
- What?

459
00:38:23,008 --> 00:38:27,604
- High school.
- Lincoln, in Pittsburgh.

460
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,616
- Who are you?
- Who was your senior English teacher?.

461
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,948
Are you kidding?

462
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:37,785
- Your 1 2th-grade English teacher was--
- Mrs. Walsh.

463
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:42,624
Nancy. Lincoln. Walsh.
Thanks very much.

464
00:39:04,049 --> 00:39:06,643
Lincoln High School.

465
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,483
I sat next to you
in Mrs. Walsh's English class.

466
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,489
I'm sorry.

467
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,620
- That's amazing.
- You don't remember me, do you?

468
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:21,860
I even asked you to the prom.

469
00:39:25,037 --> 00:39:27,699
I was short,
and I've sprouted.

470
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,845
Gosh! How are you?

471
00:39:34,713 --> 00:39:37,580
Great.
You look terrific.

472
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:40,175
You look very terrific.

473
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:46,016
- I have to do this report.
- Are you a reporter?.

474
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:49,026
I'm a weatherman
with Channel 9 Pittsburgh.

475
00:39:49,094 --> 00:39:51,289
I should have known.
That's great!

476
00:39:51,363 --> 00:39:53,160
Maybe later we could--

477
00:39:53,232 --> 00:39:54,699
Whatever.

478
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:58,032
Stay right here.
Promise me?

479
00:39:58,103 --> 00:40:00,537
I'll be right back.
Wish me luck.

480
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,039
Good luck!

481
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,225
Who's Rita?

482
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,235
How should I know?

483
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:34,067
Is this some kind
of one-night stand?

484
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:37,074
On the contrary, Nancy.
I love you.

485
00:40:37,142 --> 00:40:40,236
I've always loved you.

486
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:44,248
This is gonna seem sudden, but...

487
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:47,251
Nancy, Will you be my wife?

488
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:57,928
Whatever.

489
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,268
A gust of wind.

490
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:07,938
A dog barks.

491
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:10,941
Cue the truck.

492
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:19,883
Exit Herman.

493
00:41:19,952 --> 00:41:22,614
Walk into the bank.

494
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,749
Exit Felix. Stand there with
a not-so-bright look on your face.

495
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,685
All right, Doris, come on.

496
00:41:30,763 --> 00:41:34,255
Fix your bra, honey.
That's better.

497
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:38,269
"Felix."
"How you doing, Doris?"

498
00:41:38,337 --> 00:41:41,966
"Can I have a roll of quarters?"

499
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:47,479
Ten, nine, eight--

500
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:52,245
Car. Six, five--

501
00:41:52,317 --> 00:41:54,615
Quarters.

502
00:41:54,686 --> 00:41:56,244
Three...

503
00:41:56,321 --> 00:41:57,811
two--

504
00:42:07,232 --> 00:42:09,666
- What?
- Did I bring out two bags or one?

505
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,794
I don't know.

506
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,358
I thought we were going
to a costume party.

507
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:44,527
It's like I said,
I love this film.

508
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,696
I've seen It
over a hundred times.

509
00:42:48,273 --> 00:42:52,209
I told you to call me Bronco.

510
00:42:52,277 --> 00:42:53,869
Sorry, Bronco.

511
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:05,390
My old fiance.
They never remember me.

512
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:13,564
- That will be one adult and--
- Two adults.

513
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:17,503
Who, as legend has it, can predict
the coming. of an early spring..

514
00:43:17,503 --> 00:43:22,736
Who, as legend has it, can predict
the coming. of an early spring..

515
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:27,802
The question we have to ask ourselves
today is, "Does Phil feel lucky?"

516
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,749
Rita, if you only had one day to live,
what would you do with it?

517
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:35,582
I don't know, Phil.
What are you dying of?.

518
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:41,422
I mean, the whole world
is about to explode. What do you do?

519
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:44,087
I want to know
where to put the camera.

520
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:46,757
Are you looking
for a date for the weekend?

521
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:49,926
I'm just interested in you.

522
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:54,439
What do you want? What do you like?
What do you think about?

523
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,940
What kind of men
are you interested in?

524
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,443
What do you do for fun?

525
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:02,947
Is this for real or are you trying
to make me look like a fool?

526
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:07,281
I'm just trying to talk like normal
people talk. Isn't this how they talk?

527
00:44:07,352 --> 00:44:09,946
- Close.
- So talk to me.

528
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,115
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

529
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:17,492
- And a donut.
- All right.

530
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:21,624
What do you want
out of life?

531
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,969
I guess I want
what everybody wants:

532
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:29,565
career, love, marriage, children.

533
00:44:29,641 --> 00:44:31,438
Are you seeing anyone?

534
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:33,978
I think this is
getting too personal.

535
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:36,606
I don't think I'm ready
to share this with you.

536
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:40,014
How about you?
What do you want?

537
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,646
What I really want
is someone like you.

538
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:47,157
- Please.
- Why not?

539
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:50,024
What are you looking for?.
Who is your perfect guy?.

540
00:44:51,396 --> 00:44:55,332
First of all, he's too humble
to know he's perfect.

541
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,327
That's me.

542
00:44:58,403 --> 00:45:01,839
He's intelligent,
supportive, funny.

543
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:07,776
Me, me, me.

544
00:45:07,846 --> 00:45:12,306
- He's romantic and courageous.
- Me also

545
00:45:12,384 --> 00:45:16,480
He's got a good body, but doesn't look
in the mirror every two minutes.

546
00:45:16,555 --> 00:45:21,993
I have a great body, and sometimes
I go months without looking.

547
00:45:24,429 --> 00:45:27,990
He's kind, sensitive and gentle.

548
00:45:28,066 --> 00:45:30,534
He's not afraid to cry
in front of me.

549
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:33,196
This is a man, right?

550
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:38,539
He like animals and children,
and he'll change poopy diapers.

551
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,044
Does he have
to use the word "poopy"?

552
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:46,050
And he plays an instrument,
and he loves his mother.

553
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:50,551
I am really close on this one.

554
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,726
It's Phil Connors.

555
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:02,733
Hello
Thanks for watching.

556
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:19,413
So, what are the chances
of getting out today?.

557
00:46:19,484 --> 00:46:21,918
The van still won't start.
Larry's working on lt.

558
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:25,582
Wouldn't you know lt.
Can I buy you a drink?

559
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:30,826
Jim Beam, ice, water.

560
00:46:30,896 --> 00:46:32,761
For you, miss?

561
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:36,426
Sweet vermouth on the rocks
with a twist, please.

562
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,274
What are the chances
of getting out of town today?.

563
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,937
The van still won't start.
Larry's working on lt.

564
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:51,108
Wouldn't you know lt.
Can I buy you a drink?

565
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:56,343
Sweet vermouth,
rocks with a twist, please.

566
00:46:56,421 --> 00:46:59,948
- For you, miss?
- The same.

567
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:03,961
- That's my favorite drink.
- Mine too.

568
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:08,966
It always make me think of Rome,
the way the sun hits the buildings.

569
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,795
What shall we drink to?

570
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,132
To the groundhog.

571
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,472
I always drink to world peace.

572
00:47:27,486 --> 00:47:29,647
Can I buy you a drink?

573
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,716
Sweet vermouth,
rocks with a twist, please.

574
00:47:35,794 --> 00:47:38,160
For you, miss?

575
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:42,326
The same.
That's my favorite drink.

576
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,995
Mine too.

577
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,504
It always make me think of Rome...

578
00:47:47,572 --> 00:47:52,339
the way the sun hits the buildings.

579
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,504
What shall we drink to?

580
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:59,513
I like to say a prayer
and drink to world peace.

581
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,355
To world peace.

582
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:09,250
Amen.

583
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:16,868
- This is wonderful.
- Didn't I tell you?

584
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:19,028
How do you know so much
about Punxsutawney?.

585
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:21,698
I've spent a lot of time here.

586
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:25,209
- Small town people are more real.
- That's how I feel.

587
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,711
Really?.
Would you like some white chocolate?

588
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:31,374
- Don't make me sick.
- No white chocolate.

589
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,544
There is something familiar
about this.

590
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:38,885
- Do you ever have deja vu?
- Didn't you just ask me that?

591
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:46,727
People place too much emphasis
on their careers.

592
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:50,393
I wish we could all live
in the mountains at high altitude.

593
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,903
That's where I see myself
in five years.

594
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:55,405
- How about you?
- I agree.

595
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:59,570
I like to go with the flow,
see where It leads me.

596
00:48:59,644 --> 00:49:01,578
It's led you here.

597
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:07,081
It's a million miles
from where I started in college.

598
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:09,916
You weren't in broadcasting
or journalism?

599
00:49:11,656 --> 00:49:16,093
Believe It or not I studied
1 9th-century French poetry.

600
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:17,924
What a waste of time.

601
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:21,090
For someone else that would be
an incredible waste of time.

602
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:24,101
It was so bold of you to choose that.
It's incredible.

603
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:27,627
You must be a very strong person.

604
00:49:28,874 --> 00:49:32,605
People place too much emphasis
on their careers.

605
00:49:32,677 --> 00:49:37,444
I wish we could all live
in the mountains, at high altitudes.

606
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,780
That's where I see myself
in five years.

607
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:41,785
- How about you?
- I agree.

608
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:45,118
I like to go with the flow,
see what happens.

609
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,954
It's gotten you here.

610
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:51,120
It's a million miles
from where I started in college.

611
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:54,290
You weren't in broadcasting
or journalism?

612
00:49:56,001 --> 00:49:59,960
Believe It or not I studied
1 9th-century French poetry.

613
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,522
You speak French.

614
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:27,331
- I haven't done this since I was a kid.
- Me neither.

615
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:30,391
- It's fun.
- It's good, clean fun.

616
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:37,174
I hope that one day I can do this
with my own children.

617
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:42,509
Where did you get that?

618
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:45,345
I went over to the snowman shop,

619
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:48,746
An assassin!

620
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:50,788
I'll protect you,
Your Majesty.

621
00:50:50,855 --> 00:50:54,018
I shall die for you!
You shall not take her!

622
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,525
Find cover, my lady!

623
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,862
- Nice arm.
- I'm getting some good ones.

624
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,865
There's a boy.
That's a boy. Good try.

625
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:03,924
- Got him.
- Help me.

626
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:06,756
- What?
- I'm amazed, and I'm not easily amazed.

627
00:52:06,831 --> 00:52:09,425
- About what?
- How you can start a day...

628
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:13,767
with one kind of expectation
and end up so completely different.

629
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:18,271
Do you like the way
this day is turning out?

630
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:20,937
I like It very much.

631
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:24,607
It's a perfect day.
You couldn't plan a day like this.

632
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:29,279
You can.
It just take an awful lot of work

633
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:31,788
Come on in.
I want to show you something.

634
00:52:31,856 --> 00:52:34,290
- I don't think I should.
- I don't think you should either.

635
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:38,295
That's why I'll show you one thing
and kick you out. Just one minute.

636
00:52:46,871 --> 00:52:49,135
It's just lovely.

637
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:03,487
Would you like to sit and stare
at the fake fire?

638
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:09,492
It's really a wonderful room.

639
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,153
It is now.

640
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:20,830
I don't know.
I don't think we should do this.

641
00:53:20,905 --> 00:53:22,338
I don't either.

642
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:28,337
On second thought,
I think we should.

643
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:31,507
It's the perfect end
to a perfect day.

644
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,678
It's a little fast for me.

645
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,517
Me too.

646
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,853
Maybe I should go

647
00:53:39,924 --> 00:53:42,188
Where would you go?

648
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:46,356
Why?.
We've got a perfect fire.

649
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:49,195
I've got some French poetry here.
Baudelaire.

650
00:53:50,935 --> 00:53:52,527
I will read to you.

651
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,698
I've got ice cream
on the windowsill.

652
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,708
Hold on a minute.

653
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:06,049
- Rocky Road?
- I love Rocky Road.

654
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:08,381
I thought so

655
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,045
You have to stay.

656
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:14,387
I'm tired.
We can see each other tomorrow.

657
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:18,225
Tonight.
It's gotta be tonight.

658
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:23,234
- Really.
-Just stay for awhile.

659
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:27,897
If you like it, stay for a while longer
and awhile longer.

660
00:54:27,972 --> 00:54:32,568
- Let's not spoil lt.
- I don't want to spoil It either.

661
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:35,738
You know I can't stay with you.

662
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:38,908
Why not? I love you.

663
00:54:40,985 --> 00:54:43,078
You love me?

664
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:47,887
- You don't even know me.
- I know you.

665
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:52,092
I can't believe I fell for this.

666
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:54,757
This whole day has just been
one long setup,

667
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:58,826
- It hasn't.
- And I hate fudge.

668
00:54:58,903 --> 00:55:01,167
No white chocolate.
No fudge.

669
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:05,107
What are you doing?
Are you making some kind of list?

670
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:08,771
Did you call my friends and ask
what I like and what I don't like?

671
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:12,442
- Is this what love is for you?
- This is real. This is love.

672
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:16,283
Stop saying that!
You must be crazy.

673
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:20,120
I could never love someone like you.
You only love yourself.

674
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:24,252
That's not true. I don't even like
myself. Give me another chance.

675
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:28,128
That's for making me care about you.

676
00:55:35,006 --> 00:55:38,134
- I haven't done this since I was a kid.
- Me neither.

677
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,973
- It's fun.
- Good, clean fun too.

678
00:55:41,045 --> 00:55:43,809
That's what's missing
in the world today.

679
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:46,476
I can't wait to do this
with my own children.

680
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:48,644
Golly, I want lots of kids!

681
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,654
I want to adopt,
I want to have my own.

682
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:54,317
I want foster kids.
I got this at Snowman City.

683
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:58,218
Some kid threw
a snowball at us!

684
00:55:58,296 --> 00:56:01,231
Come here!
Let's have some fun!

685
00:56:04,068 --> 00:56:06,229
I wish these were my own kids!

686
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:11,500
Are any of you up for adoption?

687
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:15,402
Here's a humdinger over here!
Wasn't that great?

688
00:56:25,223 --> 00:56:26,986
Stop it!

689
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:14,070
Over here!

690
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,802
Where have you been?
You're missing all the fun.

691
00:57:18,876 --> 00:57:20,901
You look terrible.

692
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:24,073
What happened?
Rough night?

693
00:57:42,433 --> 00:57:46,426
Okay, campers, rise and shine.

694
00:57:48,206 --> 00:57:51,437
Don't forget your booties
because It's cold out there today.

695
00:57:52,944 --> 00:57:55,674
It's cold out there every day.

696
00:57:55,747 --> 00:57:59,706
This country's largest lake, Chapala,
is located near the city....

697
00:57:59,784 --> 00:58:01,945
- of Guadalajara.
- What is Mexico?

698
00:58:03,287 --> 00:58:05,619
- Correct..
- "Lakes and Rivers, "400.

699
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:09,023
Seneca is the largest of these lakes
in West-Central New York.

700
00:58:09,093 --> 00:58:11,584
- What are the Finger Lake?
- Correct..

701
00:58:11,662 --> 00:58:13,596
- That's amazing.
- "Lakes and Rivers" for 600.

702
00:58:13,664 --> 00:58:16,224
This South American lake drains
into the smaller lake in Bolivia.

703
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:20,031
- What is Titicaca?
- Correct..

704
00:58:20,104 --> 00:58:22,470
- "Lakes and Rivers" for 1,000.
- Milky colored...

705
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,973
- from glacial clay...
- What is the rhone?

706
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:27,978
when entering. Lake Geneva,
this river is clear upon exiting..

707
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:30,810
Jim?
The Rhone is good for $1,000.

708
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:35,717
- You are $500 off the lead.
- Let's go to "Inventors" for 200.

709
00:58:35,787 --> 00:58:38,085
This is pitiful.

710
00:58:38,156 --> 00:58:42,889
A thousand people freezing their butts
off, waiting to worship a rat.

711
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,623
What a hype. Groundhog Day used
to mean something in this town.

712
00:58:46,697 --> 00:58:49,325
They used to pull the hog out
and eat it!

713
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,494
You're hypocrites, all of you!

714
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:57,970
You got a problem
with what I'm saying?

715
00:58:58,042 --> 00:59:00,806
Until your tongue,
and you come out here and talk.

716
00:59:00,878 --> 00:59:02,846
Am I upsetting you, Princess?

717
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:07,942
You want a prediction about the weather,
you're asking the wrong Phil.

718
00:59:08,019 --> 00:59:10,920
I'll give you a winter prediction.

719
00:59:10,988 --> 00:59:13,286
It's gonna be cold...

720
00:59:13,357 --> 00:59:15,518
It's gonna be gray...

721
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:20,758
and It's gonna last you
for the rest of your life.

722
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:59,403
Once again, the eyes of the nation
have turned here to this...

723
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,734
tiny village
in western Pennsylvania.

724
01:00:03,074 --> 01:00:06,066
There is no way that
this winter...

725
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:09,170
Is ever going to end...

726
01:00:09,247 --> 01:00:13,206
as long as this groundhog
keeps seeing his shadow.

727
01:00:13,284 --> 01:00:15,309
I don't see any other way out.

728
01:00:16,187 --> 01:00:18,121
He has to be stopped.

729
01:00:19,323 --> 01:00:20,881
I have to stop him.

730
01:00:23,394 --> 01:00:25,225
Real good, Phil.

731
01:00:27,331 --> 01:00:28,923
He's crazy.

732
01:00:33,571 --> 01:00:36,836
I'm worried. I think there's something
really wrong with Phil.

733
01:00:36,908 --> 01:00:39,536
There's a lot of things
really wrong with Phil.

734
01:00:43,714 --> 01:00:46,012
I've come to the end of me.

735
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:49,450
There's no way out now.

736
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,956
I just want you to remember
we had a beautiful day together once.

737
01:00:56,294 --> 01:00:59,821
All right, little fella.
Good job.

738
01:00:59,897 --> 01:01:02,525
- He smiled at me. Did you see that?
- I believe he did.

739
01:01:04,168 --> 01:01:06,329
Okay, little fella.
There you go

740
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:11,307
Hl, mister.
Something I can do you for?.

741
01:01:13,945 --> 01:01:15,879
What are you doing?

742
01:01:20,585 --> 01:01:22,712
Jake, get the word out!
Somebody kidnapped Phil!

743
01:01:22,787 --> 01:01:24,379
We're going after him!

744
01:01:30,861 --> 01:01:33,887
Why would anybody steal a groundhog?

745
01:01:33,965 --> 01:01:36,957
I can probably think
of a couple of reasons. Pervert.

746
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:06,321
- He must have just snapped!
- This should be good.

747
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:11,701
What is he doing?
What can he be thinking?

748
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:14,203
That's not bad
for a quadruped.

749
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:18,106
You gotta check your mirrors,
Just the side of your eye.

750
01:02:24,048 --> 01:02:25,777
That's lt.

751
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:28,478
They're chasing us!
Come on, make It fun!

752
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:39,759
Don't drive angry.

753
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:04,380
Hot dog! There's no way out except
the way we came in. We got him now!

754
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:26,139
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.

755
01:03:30,247 --> 01:03:33,273
If you gotta shoot, aim high.
I don't wanna hit the groundhog.

756
01:03:37,621 --> 01:03:39,816
We mustn't keep
our public waiting.

757
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:44,494
It's show time.

758
01:03:50,768 --> 01:03:53,202
All right, on me, Larry,
in three!

759
01:03:54,638 --> 01:03:58,199
Two, one.

760
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:16,526
He might be okay.

761
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:23,723
Probably not now.

762
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:41,475
Nuts.

763
01:04:48,526 --> 01:04:51,859
Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

764
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:55,558
Would you like some toast?

765
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:17,012
- What's going on?
- My God.

766
01:05:49,286 --> 01:05:50,719
That's him.

767
01:05:53,724 --> 01:05:57,387
He was a really great guy.

768
01:05:57,461 --> 01:06:00,294
I really liked him a lot.

769
01:06:07,771 --> 01:06:07,905
I'm sorry.
What was that again?

770
01:06:07,905 --> 01:06:09,998
I'm sorry.
What was that again?

771
01:06:10,074 --> 01:06:13,168
- I'm a god!
- You're a god?

772
01:06:13,244 --> 01:06:16,611
I'm a god.
I'm not the God, I don't think.

773
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:19,274
Because you survived a car wreck?

774
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,942
You ready to order?.

775
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:24,181
I didn't just survive a wreck.
I wasn't just blown up yesterday.

776
01:06:24,255 --> 01:06:27,122
I have been stabbed,
shot poisoned...

777
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:30,126
frozen, hung, electrocuted...

778
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:32,458
- and burned.
- Really?.

779
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:37,297
Every morning I wake up fine,
not a dent in the fender.

780
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:41,304
- I am an immortal.
- Special today is blueberry waffles.

781
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:43,363
Why are you telling me this?

782
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,772
Because I want you
to believe in me.

783
01:06:45,843 --> 01:06:50,940
You're not a god. Believe me. This is
12 years of Catholic school talking.

784
01:06:51,015 --> 01:06:53,449
I could come back
if you're not ready.

785
01:06:53,517 --> 01:06:55,815
How do you know I'm not a god?

786
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:59,720
Please!
Because It's not possible!

787
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:02,850
- I'll come back.
- Doris!

788
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:09,494
This is Doris. Her brother-in-law,
Carl, owns this diner.

789
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:14,129
She's worked here since she was 1 7.
She wants to see Paris before she dies.

790
01:07:14,204 --> 01:07:16,604
- Boy, would l!
- What are you doing?

791
01:07:16,674 --> 01:07:20,235
- Debbie Klelser and her fiance, Fred.
- Do I know you?

792
01:07:20,311 --> 01:07:23,439
They're supposed to be married this
afternoon, but Debbie is reconsidering.

793
01:07:23,514 --> 01:07:26,483
- What?
- Lovely ring.

794
01:07:26,550 --> 01:07:28,745
This is Bill who's been a walter
for three years...

795
01:07:28,819 --> 01:07:31,310
since he left Penn State
and had to get work

796
01:07:31,388 --> 01:07:34,221
He like the town, paints toy soldiers,
and he's gay.

797
01:07:34,291 --> 01:07:36,156
I am.

798
01:07:36,226 --> 01:07:39,320
This is Gus. He hates his life here
and wishes he'd stayed in the Navy.

799
01:07:39,396 --> 01:07:42,058
I could have retired on half pay
after 20 years.

800
01:07:42,132 --> 01:07:44,191
Is this some kind of trick?

801
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:47,169
Maybe the real God uses tricks.
Maybe He's not omnipotent.

802
01:07:47,237 --> 01:07:50,365
He's just been around so long,
He knows everything.

803
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:51,874
- Who's that?
- This is Tom.

804
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:54,172
He worked in the coal mine
till they closed It down.

805
01:07:54,244 --> 01:07:55,677
- Her?.
- Alice.

806
01:07:55,746 --> 01:07:58,374
She came from Ireland as a baby
and lived in Erie most of her life.

807
01:07:58,449 --> 01:08:00,576
- He's right.
- Nancy.

808
01:08:00,651 --> 01:08:05,384
She works in the dress shop and make
chipmunk noises when she gets excited.

809
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:07,390
- It's true.
- How do you know these people?

810
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:12,259
I know everything. I n five seconds,
a walter will drop a tray of dishes.

811
01:08:12,329 --> 01:08:15,127
- Five, four, three, two, one.
- This is nuts.

812
01:08:17,901 --> 01:08:19,334
That's enough.

813
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:24,771
- Do you know me too?
- I know all about you.

814
01:08:24,842 --> 01:08:27,640
You like producing, but you're hoping
for more than Channel 9 Pittsburgh.

815
01:08:27,711 --> 01:08:30,236
Everyone knows that.

816
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:33,579
You like boats, but not the ocean.

817
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:37,212
You go to a mountain lake in the summer
with your family.

818
01:08:37,287 --> 01:08:39,312
There's a long, wooden dock
and a boathouse...

819
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:41,415
with boards missing
from the roof....

820
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:44,825
and a place you used to crawl
underneath to be alone.

821
01:08:44,895 --> 01:08:49,264
You're a sucker for French poetry
and rhinestones.

822
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:51,096
You're very generous.

823
01:08:51,168 --> 01:08:54,035
You're kind to strangers
and children.

824
01:08:54,104 --> 01:08:56,937
And when you stand in the snow,
you look like an angel.

825
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:58,941
How are you doing this?

826
01:09:00,077 --> 01:09:04,946
I wake up every day right here...

827
01:09:05,015 --> 01:09:08,507
In Punxsutawney,
and It's always February 2.

828
01:09:09,586 --> 01:09:12,020
There's nothing
I can do about lt.

829
01:09:12,856 --> 01:09:16,019
If you still doubt me...

830
01:09:16,093 --> 01:09:18,561
In ten seconds...

831
01:09:18,629 --> 01:09:22,326
Larry will come through that door
and take you away from me...

832
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:25,129
but you can't let him.

833
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:28,171
Please believe me.
You've got to believe me.

834
01:09:33,343 --> 01:09:37,279
You ready?. We better get going if we're
going to stay ahead of the weather.

835
01:09:37,347 --> 01:09:39,611
What's that?

836
01:09:48,125 --> 01:09:50,059
Maybe It really is happening.

837
01:09:50,127 --> 01:09:52,220
How else could you know so much?

838
01:09:52,296 --> 01:09:54,787
There is no way.
I'm not that smart.

839
01:09:55,966 --> 01:09:58,400
Maybe I should spend the day
with you...

840
01:09:58,469 --> 01:10:01,996
as an objective witness,
Just to see what happens.

841
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:04,802
This sounds
like a science project.

842
01:10:05,776 --> 01:10:08,472
Concentrate.
You gotta want lt.

843
01:10:12,149 --> 01:10:15,846
It's more in the wrist than the finger.
It's just gotta--

844
01:10:24,161 --> 01:10:26,095
Be the hat! Come on! Go!

845
01:10:26,163 --> 01:10:28,097
It would take me a year
to get good at this.

846
01:10:28,165 --> 01:10:32,693
Six months. Four to five hours a day,
and you'd be an expert.

847
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:35,136
Is this what you do
with eternity?.

848
01:10:35,205 --> 01:10:36,832
Now you know.

849
01:10:38,242 --> 01:10:40,233
That's not the worst part.

850
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:42,244
What's the worst part?

851
01:10:42,312 --> 01:10:47,113
The worst part is that tomorrow you
will have forgotten all about this...

852
01:10:47,184 --> 01:10:50,381
and you'll treat me
like a jerk again.

853
01:10:50,454 --> 01:10:54,049
- It's all right. I am a jerk
- You're not.

854
01:10:54,124 --> 01:10:56,183
It doesn't make any difference.

855
01:10:56,260 --> 01:11:00,890
I've killed myself so many times,
I don't even exist anymore.

856
01:11:00,964 --> 01:11:04,297
Sometimes I wish
I had a thousand lifetimes.

857
01:11:04,368 --> 01:11:07,997
I don't know, Phil.
Maybe It's not a curse.

858
01:11:08,071 --> 01:11:10,596
It just depends on
how you look at lt.

859
01:11:12,376 --> 01:11:14,571
Gosh, you're an upbeat lady!

860
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:22,309
- It's been a really nice day for me.
- Me too.

861
01:11:22,386 --> 01:11:27,414
Maybe, if it's not too boring,
we could do It again sometime.

862
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:29,425
I hope so

863
01:11:41,371 --> 01:11:42,929
You're still here.

864
01:11:44,541 --> 01:11:48,477
I thought you were supposed
to disappear or I was or something!

865
01:11:48,545 --> 01:11:51,036
Not until 6:00.

866
01:11:51,114 --> 01:11:52,741
You rat!

867
01:11:52,816 --> 01:11:54,545
I never said midnight.

868
01:11:54,618 --> 01:11:59,578
- You knew I was waiting for midnight!
- Does this mean you're gonna leave?

869
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:04,493
Good.

870
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:16,638
I'm sorry.

871
01:12:18,408 --> 01:12:21,571
It's all right.
You can fall asleep,

872
01:12:21,645 --> 01:12:25,979
I promise
I won't touch you, much.

873
01:12:27,251 --> 01:12:30,652
That's all right.
I'm not tired.

874
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:32,746
What were you saying?

875
01:12:33,957 --> 01:12:37,324
I think the last thing
that you heard was...

876
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:39,919
"Only God can make a tree."

877
01:12:39,997 --> 01:12:41,430
Really?.

878
01:13:19,703 --> 01:13:21,637
What I wanted to say was...

879
01:13:23,674 --> 01:13:29,044
I think you're the kindest, sweetest,
prettiest person...

880
01:13:29,112 --> 01:13:31,205
I've ever met in my life.

881
01:13:32,683 --> 01:13:35,413
I've never seen anyone...

882
01:13:35,485 --> 01:13:37,885
that's nicer to people
than you are.

883
01:13:51,134 --> 01:13:54,001
The first time I saw you...

884
01:13:54,071 --> 01:13:57,563
something happened to me.

885
01:13:57,641 --> 01:14:00,075
I never told you, but...

886
01:14:03,213 --> 01:14:07,741
I knew that I wanted
to hold you as hard as I could.

887
01:14:20,597 --> 01:14:23,760
I don't deserve someone like you.

888
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:30,169
But if I ever could...

889
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:32,572
I swear I would love you...

890
01:14:32,642 --> 01:14:34,769
for the rest of my life.

891
01:14:39,383 --> 01:14:41,442
Did you say something?

892
01:14:46,957 --> 01:14:48,390
Good night.

893
01:16:00,964 --> 01:16:03,398
Who wants coffee?
Get It while It's hot.

894
01:16:03,467 --> 01:16:05,230
Thanks, Phil.

895
01:16:05,302 --> 01:16:10,330
- Larry?. Skim milk, two sugars.
- Thanks, Phil.

896
01:16:10,407 --> 01:16:12,967
- Pastry?.
- We're just setting up,

897
01:16:13,043 --> 01:16:14,943
Take your pick.

898
01:16:16,213 --> 01:16:18,272
Thanks. Raspberry. Great.

899
01:16:18,348 --> 01:16:21,875
I was just talking with Buster Green,
the head groundhog honcho

900
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:24,944
He said if we set up over here,
we might get a better shot.

901
01:16:25,021 --> 01:16:27,683
- What do you think?
- Sounds good.

902
01:16:27,757 --> 01:16:29,224
What do you think?

903
01:16:30,527 --> 01:16:32,461
Let's go for lt.

904
01:16:32,529 --> 01:16:35,521
- Good work
- Maybe we'll get lucky .

905
01:16:35,599 --> 01:16:37,533
Let me help you
with the heavy stuff..

906
01:16:39,302 --> 01:16:42,237
You got your coffee.
I'll get lt.

907
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:45,274
We never talk.
Do you have kids?

908
01:17:19,976 --> 01:17:21,910
I'd like a piano lesson, please.

909
01:17:21,978 --> 01:17:26,415
I'm with a student now. If you come
back tomorrow, I can squeeze you in.

910
01:17:26,483 --> 01:17:29,646
I kind of want to get started.
I could give you $1 ,000.

911
01:17:31,888 --> 01:17:33,321
Come on in.

912
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:55,136
Good morning!
Off to see the groundhog?

913
01:17:58,281 --> 01:18:00,806
You think It will be
an early spring?

914
01:18:00,884 --> 01:18:03,409
"Winter slumbering in the open air...

915
01:18:03,486 --> 01:18:05,420
wears on his smiling face...

916
01:18:05,488 --> 01:18:07,456
a dream of spring."

917
01:18:49,532 --> 01:18:50,965
How's she look?

918
01:18:51,034 --> 01:18:53,594
- Great.
- Thank you.

919
01:18:53,670 --> 01:18:55,638
Did you know
he could ice sculpt?

920
01:19:11,421 --> 01:19:14,515
Not bad.
You say this is your first lesson?

921
01:19:15,458 --> 01:19:18,188
My father was a piano mover.

922
01:19:24,734 --> 01:19:26,895
I thought It was you.

923
01:19:30,807 --> 01:19:33,435
I have missed you so much.

924
01:19:37,414 --> 01:19:41,350
I don't know where you're headed,
but can you call in sick?

925
01:19:44,754 --> 01:19:47,450
I gotta get going.

926
01:19:47,524 --> 01:19:49,583
It's good to see you.

927
01:20:07,677 --> 01:20:09,838
Hello, father.

928
01:20:09,913 --> 01:20:13,405
Let's get you someplace warm.

929
01:20:13,483 --> 01:20:14,916
Remember me?

930
01:20:20,056 --> 01:20:23,116
Excuse me, sir. Are you the one
who brought the old man in?

931
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:25,184
How is he?

932
01:20:25,261 --> 01:20:27,627
He just passed away.

933
01:20:28,865 --> 01:20:30,799
What did he die of?.

934
01:20:30,867 --> 01:20:34,132
He was just old.
It was just his time.

935
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:40,000
- I want to see his chart. Excuse me.
- Sir!

936
01:20:40,076 --> 01:20:42,237
You can't come in here.

937
01:20:42,312 --> 01:20:44,974
This is a restricted area.

938
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:56,220
Where's the chart?

939
01:20:56,292 --> 01:20:59,489
Sometimes people just die.

940
01:20:59,562 --> 01:21:01,496
Not today.

941
01:21:13,343 --> 01:21:15,277
It's hard down there
at the bottom.

942
01:21:18,515 --> 01:21:21,177
- Here you go
- Thank you.

943
01:21:25,522 --> 01:21:27,513
Come on, Dad!
Come on, Pop!

944
01:21:31,561 --> 01:21:34,189
Breathe, Pop!

945
01:22:00,723 --> 01:22:03,317
When Chekhov
saw the long winter...

946
01:22:03,393 --> 01:22:07,295
he saw a winter bleak and dark
and bereft of hope.

947
01:22:07,363 --> 01:22:12,300
Yet we know that winter is just
another step in the cycle of life.

948
01:22:12,368 --> 01:22:16,236
But standing here
among the people of Punxsutawney...

949
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:19,036
and basking in the warmth
of their hearths and hearts...

950
01:22:20,143 --> 01:22:22,407
I couldn't imagine a better fate...

951
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:25,744
than a long and lustrous winter.

952
01:22:25,815 --> 01:22:28,807
From Punxsutawney,
It's Phil Connors.

953
01:22:28,885 --> 01:22:30,318
So long.

954
01:22:32,021 --> 01:22:33,955
Very nice speech, Phil.

955
01:22:34,023 --> 01:22:36,355
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

956
01:22:36,426 --> 01:22:39,657
- How was that for you two?
- Man, you touched me.

957
01:22:39,729 --> 01:22:41,663
- Thanks, Larry.
- Thank you.

958
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:45,463
I gotta go

959
01:22:45,535 --> 01:22:49,733
That was surprising.
I didn't know you were so versatile.

960
01:22:49,806 --> 01:22:51,740
I surprise myself sometimes.

961
01:22:51,808 --> 01:22:53,867
Would you like
to get some coffee?

962
01:22:53,943 --> 01:22:57,936
I'd love to. Can I have a rain check?
I've got some errands to run.

963
01:23:01,618 --> 01:23:05,554
What errands?
I thought we were going back.

964
01:23:15,231 --> 01:23:16,994
Hold it, fella!

965
01:23:23,806 --> 01:23:26,639
What do you say?.

966
01:23:26,709 --> 01:23:30,145
You little brat.
You have never thanked me!

967
01:23:30,213 --> 01:23:33,478
I'll see you tomorrow, maybe!

968
01:23:40,590 --> 01:23:43,320
- Now what?
- You've totaled lt.

969
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:48,490
It's only a flat tire.
Now just be patient. Just cool it!

970
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:52,467
- It's an earthquake!
- It's not an earthquake!

971
01:23:52,535 --> 01:23:53,968
What is it?

972
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:59,333
Thank you, young man.

973
01:24:00,476 --> 01:24:02,967
It's nothing.
I had the tire and the jack.

974
01:24:03,046 --> 01:24:05,742
Just be comfortable.
Be a minute.

975
01:24:05,815 --> 01:24:07,339
Who is that?

976
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:10,181
Must be from the motor club.

977
01:24:11,688 --> 01:24:14,384
- My God! He's having a heart attack!
- What should I do?

978
01:24:14,457 --> 01:24:17,858
- Call an ambulance, a lawyer, a doctor!
- Mom, I don't think he's breathing!

979
01:24:25,802 --> 01:24:27,736
I think that did lt.

980
01:24:31,174 --> 01:24:34,109
If you're gonna eat steak,
get some sharper teeth.

981
01:24:34,177 --> 01:24:36,873
- Enjoy your lunch.
- Thank you.

982
01:24:36,946 --> 01:24:39,676
Who was that? I'm fine.

983
01:24:39,749 --> 01:24:42,547
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yes. Eat.

984
01:24:46,956 --> 01:24:49,618
People just don't understand
what is involved in this.

985
01:24:49,692 --> 01:24:51,626
This is an art form.

986
01:24:51,694 --> 01:24:54,424
You know, I think most people
Just think that...

987
01:24:54,497 --> 01:24:57,660
I hold the camera
and point It at stuff..

988
01:24:57,734 --> 01:25:00,202
There is a lot more to It
than just that.

989
01:25:02,105 --> 01:25:05,404
Would you be at all interested
in seeing the inside of the van?

990
01:25:05,475 --> 01:25:09,377
You know, I really have to get back
to the party.

991
01:25:09,445 --> 01:25:13,404
Great idea. I'll go with you.
Let me just drop a tip here.

992
01:25:20,523 --> 01:25:23,390
How are you?
Rita, this is Nancy.

993
01:25:23,459 --> 01:25:25,893
We were just going
to the party.

994
01:25:25,962 --> 01:25:27,896
- You going?
- Sounds like fun.

995
01:25:27,964 --> 01:25:30,558
Maybe we should call Phil.

996
01:25:30,633 --> 01:25:32,692
- I think he's already in there.
- Great.

997
01:27:29,385 --> 01:27:32,218
- Isn't he good?
- He's great!

998
01:27:32,288 --> 01:27:34,222
He's my student.

999
01:27:36,526 --> 01:27:38,460
I'm so proud.

1000
01:27:39,595 --> 01:27:41,028
Thank you.

1001
01:27:41,998 --> 01:27:44,091
Welcome to our party.

1002
01:27:44,167 --> 01:27:47,933
-I didn't know you could play like that.
-I'm versatile.

1003
01:27:55,878 --> 01:27:58,904
It's that nice, young man
from the motor club.

1004
01:27:58,981 --> 01:28:02,280
- Thank you again.
- It's nothing, ladles.

1005
01:28:02,351 --> 01:28:05,752
He's the fastest jack
in Jefferson County.

1006
01:28:08,124 --> 01:28:10,058
What was that all about?

1007
01:28:10,126 --> 01:28:13,152
I really don't know.
They've been hitting on me all night.

1008
01:28:14,030 --> 01:28:15,463
There you are.

1009
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:20,734
I never thanked you properly
for what you did for Buster.

1010
01:28:20,803 --> 01:28:23,169
He would have choked for sure.

1011
01:28:23,239 --> 01:28:27,073
He may have.
He was trying to swallow a whole cow.

1012
01:28:27,143 --> 01:28:31,239
- I owe you one, buddy.
- Hang onto him, dear. He's a real find.

1013
01:28:34,116 --> 01:28:37,643
- What did you do today?.
- Same old, same old.

1014
01:28:43,292 --> 01:28:45,021
Excuse me.

1015
01:28:45,094 --> 01:28:47,028
Fred, how was the wedding?

1016
01:28:47,096 --> 01:28:50,293
I just wanted to thank you
for making Debbie go through with lt.

1017
01:28:50,366 --> 01:28:53,529
All I did was fan the flame
of her passion for you.

1018
01:28:53,603 --> 01:28:56,197
You are the best.

1019
01:28:56,272 --> 01:28:59,503
Rita,
this is Debbie and Fred Klelser.

1020
01:28:59,575 --> 01:29:02,840
- Here you go, kids. Congratulations.
- What is this?

1021
01:29:02,912 --> 01:29:06,040
No way!

1022
01:29:06,115 --> 01:29:07,548
Wrestlemania!

1023
01:29:10,152 --> 01:29:13,212
How did you know?
We're gonna be in Pittsburgh anyway!

1024
01:29:13,289 --> 01:29:17,157
- Thank you! You're a real pal!
- This is the best!

1025
01:29:22,164 --> 01:29:25,930
- I don't understand.
- I guess not.

1026
01:29:26,002 --> 01:29:28,470
How does everyone know you?
You only come here once a year.

1027
01:29:28,537 --> 01:29:31,097
You seem like the most popular person
in town.

1028
01:29:31,173 --> 01:29:33,505
Excuse me. Dr. Connors?

1029
01:29:33,576 --> 01:29:36,374
I want to thank you
for fixing Felix's back.

1030
01:29:36,445 --> 01:29:38,811
He can even help
around the house again.

1031
01:29:38,881 --> 01:29:41,349
I'm sorry to hear that, Felix.

1032
01:29:43,853 --> 01:29:45,787
"Dr. Connors"?

1033
01:29:45,855 --> 01:29:48,415
It's kind of an honorary title.

1034
01:29:48,491 --> 01:29:51,289
- What is going on?
- I really don't know.

1035
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:54,591
There is something
going on with you.

1036
01:29:54,664 --> 01:29:56,757
Would you like the long version
or the short one?

1037
01:29:56,832 --> 01:29:59,596
Let's start with the short
and go from there.

1038
01:30:05,341 --> 01:30:08,105
Okay, folks. Attention.

I don't want to know about it,

1044
01:30:24,927 --> 01:30:28,727
Get out your pocketbooks and remember,

01:31:56,218 --> 01:31:58,209
Do I hear a buck and a half?.

1064
01:31:58,287 --> 01:32:00,551
Anybody?.

I got him!

1068
01:32:16,739 --> 01:32:19,435
Phil Connors!
I thought that was you!

1069
01:32:19,508 --> 01:32:22,238
This is Ned Ryerson,
my new insurance agent.

1070
01:32:22,311 --> 01:32:23,744
I'll say!

1071
01:32:24,814 --> 01:32:26,907
I have not seen this guy
for 20 years.

1072
01:32:26,982 --> 01:32:29,951
He comes to me and buys whole life,
term, uniflex...

1073
01:32:30,019 --> 01:32:32,044
fire, theft, auto,
dental, health...

1074
01:32:32,121 --> 01:32:35,318
with the optional death
and dismemberment plan, water damage.

1075
01:32:35,391 --> 01:32:37,791
This is the best day of my life.

1076
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:40,055
Mine too.

1077
01:32:40,129 --> 01:32:43,360
- Where are we going?
- Let's not spoil lt.

1078
01:32:46,268 --> 01:32:47,701
I got that!

1079
01:32:50,706 --> 01:32:54,198
- Why can't I look?
- Because you bother me a lot.

1080
01:32:54,276 --> 01:32:57,734
I'm getting cold.
How much longer do I have to sit here?

1081
01:32:57,813 --> 01:33:01,476
I'm just giving you your money's worth.
You paid top dollar for me.

1082
01:33:01,550 --> 01:33:04,383
I think you were a bargain.

1083
01:33:04,453 --> 01:33:07,354
Sweet of you to say.
You're probably right.

1084
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:12,787
- Is It finished yet?
- Almost.

1085
01:33:12,862 --> 01:33:16,696
I still have to put cherry syrup on top
and then we can eat lt.

1086
01:33:16,765 --> 01:33:19,461
Come on!
I'm freezing!

1087
01:33:19,535 --> 01:33:22,402
One second. All right.
Let me turn toward the light.

1088
01:33:28,911 --> 01:33:30,378
It's amazing.

1089
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:33,014
It's beautiful.

1090
01:33:36,652 --> 01:33:40,520
- How did you do that?
- I know your face so well...

1091
01:33:40,589 --> 01:33:42,648
I could have done It
with my eyes closed.

1092
01:33:47,296 --> 01:33:51,232
It's lovely.
I don't know what to say.

1093
01:33:52,468 --> 01:33:53,901
I do

1094
01:33:55,671 --> 01:33:58,162
No matter what happens tomorrow...

1095
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:00,265
or for the rest of my life...

1096
01:34:00,342 --> 01:34:04,108
I'm happy now
because I love you.

1097
01:34:05,814 --> 01:34:07,748
I think I'm happy too.

1098
01:35:06,275 --> 01:35:08,869
- Please, not again.
- That is a great song!

1099
01:35:08,944 --> 01:35:10,571
- It's not!
- Don't listen to this man--

1100
01:35:12,748 --> 01:35:15,080
It's too early.

1101
01:35:25,594 --> 01:35:27,960
Something is different.

1102
01:35:28,030 --> 01:35:29,497
Good or bad?

1103
01:35:29,565 --> 01:35:32,056
Anything different is good...

1104
01:35:34,336 --> 01:35:36,497
but this could be real good.

1105
01:35:41,410 --> 01:35:43,344
Why are you here?

1106
01:35:43,412 --> 01:35:45,812
I bought you. I own you.

1107
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:49,784
But why are you still here?

1108
01:35:49,852 --> 01:35:52,548
You said stay, so I stayed.

1109
01:35:55,524 --> 01:35:57,788
I said stay, so you stayed?

1110
01:35:57,860 --> 01:36:00,556
I can't even make a collie stay.

1111
01:36:02,498 --> 01:36:05,296
I gotta check something.

1112
01:36:05,367 --> 01:36:06,800
Stay.

1113
01:36:13,776 --> 01:36:15,209
They're gone!

1114
01:36:16,111 --> 01:36:18,170
They're all gone!

1115
01:36:19,748 --> 01:36:22,581
- Do you know what today is?
- What?

1116
01:36:23,919 --> 01:36:26,319
Today is tomorrow.

1117
01:36:26,388 --> 01:36:28,083
It happened.

1118
01:36:30,025 --> 01:36:32,220
- You're here.
- I'm here.

1119
01:36:36,165 --> 01:36:40,761
Why weren't you like this last night?
You just fell sleep,

1120
01:36:42,938 --> 01:36:45,429
It was the end
of a very long day.

1121
01:36:48,811 --> 01:36:52,440
Is there anything
I can do for you today?.

1122
01:36:52,514 --> 01:36:55,847
I'm sure I can think
of something.

1123
01:37:29,251 --> 01:37:31,185
It's so beautiful!

1124
01:37:41,830 --> 01:37:43,764
Let's live here.

1125
01:37:53,942 --> 01:37:56,035
We'll rent to start.
