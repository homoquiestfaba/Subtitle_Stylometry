what can I do to--

80
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,555
I've been standing
all afternoon.

81
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:17,757
I'm very tired.

00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:18,958

Yes, Princess.

87
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:36,275
Halo, do you realize he'll
go immediately to the tower

88
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,444
and throw himself off?

89
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:42,248
Maybe then they'll put off
this wedding for a while.

90
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:45,017
A thousand tailors
could jump off the tower,

91
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:48,888
and you'll still get
married tomorrow.

92
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,957
Doesn't it matter
that I don't want to?

93
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:55,561
Halo, tomorrow you take
a husband and the thrown.

94
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,029
Your whole life's been planned.

95
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:01,334
I know about my duty
and responsibility.

96
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,902
But what about me?

97
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,972
Doesn't it matter that I
feel no love for this man?

98
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,474
You and yours do
not marry for love.

very special man.

the city are praying

104
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:24,190
that you'll rule as he did.

105

I don't need Ruechang
to do that for me.

106
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:30,763
A woman like you
could soften a man.

107
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,632
Ruechang is not a
man to be softened.

108
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:38,170
Halo, I know you
want to be in love.

109
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,574
But I tell you now, you
need to grow old with a man

believe that, Lily?

You remind me of your
mother's strength and beauty.

193
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,554
You have no right
to mention my mother.

194
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:36,522
Now get out.
- Halo.

195
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:37,523
Get out!

196
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:45,164
Now I'll go.

197
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,371
Nobody in, nobody out.

198
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,305
Sir!

199
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,450
How can I marry such a man?

200
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,288
- Halo--
- No.

201
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,157
I don't want to hear
any more talk of duty.

202
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,659
That man is a beast.

203
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,129
I'd rather slit my own
wrist than marry him.

204
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,564
It mustn't come to that.

205
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,168
Did you just see
what he just did?

206
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,404
You think it'll be any
better when we're married?

207
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,105
No.

208
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,540
Of course you can't marry him.

209
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,843
Lily, I'm telling
you now that--

210
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,078
what did you just say?

211
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,980
You can't marry him.

212
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,282
What do you mean?

213
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:40,419
Speak to me, Lily.

214
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,056
Are you hiding
something from me?

215
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,525
What is it?

216
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,193
I'm going to tell
you something I've

217
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,862
never told another living soul.

218
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,933
Your father's death
was no accident.

219
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,638
Ruechang killed him.

220
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:00,939
Halo--

221
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,009
How do you know this?

222
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,211
I saw him do it.

223
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,981
I was in the room.

224
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,983
Why didn't you tell anyone?

225
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,586
I was afraid.

226
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:17,356
I'm still afraid.

227
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,191
When the people
find out that Ruechang

228
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,895
killed their beloved king,
they won't stand for it.

229
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:29,101
They will stand for it.

230
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:33,472
Ruechang controls the army.

231
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:40,612
There's no one with enough power
to oppose him, not even you.

232
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:44,650
He'll stop at nothing
to sit on the throne.

233
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:52,157
If he killed my father,
he'll never sit on this throne.

234
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,392
I promise you that.

235
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,334
[church bells ringing]

236
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,053
WOMAN: Hello.

237
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:21,987
MAN: Hello.

238
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:23,655
How are you, sir?

239
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,624
[organ playing]

240
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,987
Remove your veil so
that all may see the girl

241
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,322
about to become a woman.

242
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:40,599
Before the joining of these
two, let them share wine.

243
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,327
We will now witness
the joining of General

244
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:13,065
Ruechang and Princess Halo.

245
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:17,436
But before they are so
bound, say, for all to hear,

246
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:21,139
that I, General
Ruechang, do take

247
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:26,011
Princess Halo until her death.

248
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,680
I will.

249
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:33,785
Will you, Princess Halo,
accept General Ruechang?

250
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:37,723
I'm sorry.

251
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:38,890
Could you give me that again?

252
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:49,000
Will you, Princess
Halo, accept General--

253
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,369
[surprised exclamations]

254
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,336
WOMAN: Princess!

255
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:52,904
MAN: Princess!
Princess!

256
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:53,872
Is she all right?

257
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:03,515
I think it's just the
excitement of the day.

258
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,117
Let her rest for awhile.

259
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,384
We don't have awhile.

260
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:07,652
The room is full of guests.

261
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:14,593
Marry us now.

262
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,027
But General, it would not--

263
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,262
not be valid.

264
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,865
General, giver her an hour.

265
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:24,569
I'm sure she'll come around.
- An hour it is.

266
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:41,586
[door closes]

267
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:43,188
[exciting music playing]

268
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,274
General!

269
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,442
General Ruechang, sir!

270
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:05,911
Come quickly, General.

271
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,121
[groaning]

272
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,593
[murmuring]

273
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:26,631
The Princess is
not feeling well.

274
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,099
The wedding will be in a week.

275
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,637
[murmuring]

276
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,008
[horse whinnying]

277
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,284
Do you know where
she's gone, General?

278
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:47,719
She's headed east.

279
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,688
She doesn't have
much of a head start.

280
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,122
Leave immediately.

281
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,362
The wedding's in a week.

282
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:58,530
Bring me back my bride.

283
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:21,720
[birdsong]

284
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,666
[horse nickering]

285
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:57,956
[horse grumbling]

286
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:00,325
Mm, mm, mm.

287
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,134
Just having a bit of
a dip, are we, miss?

288
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,240
Yes.

289
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,143
And I'd much rather do it
in peace, if you don't mind.

290
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,246
Oh, of course.

291
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,748
We'll just leave
you alone, then.

292
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,056
Well?

293
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,425
[chuckles] Right.

294
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:36,628
But first there is
a little matter.

295
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,902
This very fine horse.

296
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:49,874
You see, miss, the
thing is this horse,

297
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:57,082
he definitely looks like
the horse of an aristocrat.

298
00:26:57,182 --> 00:27:01,953
Do you have any idea who
you're talking to, soldier?

299
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,154
No.

300
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:06,658
But I've got a feeling
you're gonna tell me.

301
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:15,300
I'm Princess Halo.

302
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,869
The Princess?

303
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:21,406
Well, that makes
all the difference.

304
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:22,407
Doesn't it, boys?

305
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,042
[laughter]

306
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,711
Yeah!

307
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,948
No, miss, I'm sorry.

308
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:33,785
But you are just gonna
have to come with us just

309
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:35,720
to make sure, like, you know?

310
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,625
If you and your
men don't move along,

311
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:43,595
you'll be dealing
with General Ruechang.

312
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:44,529
The General?

313
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:45,930
Oh.

314
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:48,299
How is he these days?

315
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,535
'Cause I haven't bloody
seen him for ages.

316
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,037
[laughter]

317
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:56,608
[horse nickering]

318
00:27:56,708 --> 00:28:00,578
Please, sir, just
let me go my way.

319
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:02,047
Aw.

320
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:05,183
Well, we might be able to
come to some arrangement.

321
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:08,620
I mean, we could take
the horse with us.

322
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,624
[whispering] Hey,
while you're down there

323
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:16,394
on those pretty,
little knees of yours,

324
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:21,166
you could try to persuade me
that we should leave you here.

325
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,768
MAN 1: And we're gonna
need some persuading, too.

326
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,136
[laughter]

327
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:30,442
Oh, yeah.

328
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:33,545
That's it.

329
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:34,479
Give it to her.

330
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:35,447
[laughter]

331
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,182

MAN 1: Bitch!

335
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,391
Get her!

[horse whinnying]

337
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,363
[screaming]

338
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,333
[laughter]

339
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:56,935
Ah!

340
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,304
MAN: Bet that hurt!

341
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:04,676
[laughter]

342
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:05,677
Huh?

343
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,278
[laughter dying]

344
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:10,582
MAN 1: Who's that?

345
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,150
MAN 2: That's Warchild.

346
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,653
MAN 3: She really
is the Princess.

347
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,988
One more step
and I'll kill her.

MAN: Hey, get off me.

349
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:28,733
I'm telling you,
soldier, I'll do it!

00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,101
[gunshot]

351
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:31,035
Ow!

352
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:45,950
Come to take me back?

353
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,688
[horse whinnying]

354
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:52,190
I'm leaving.

355
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,325
And you can tell Ruechang
that when I return,

356
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:57,128
I'll have an army of
rebel soldiers with me.

357
00:29:57,228 --> 00:30:01,032
He's going to die for
killing my father.

358
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,536
[whispers] Let's go.

359
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,839
Ruechang didn't
kill your father.

360
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:09,407
And you know that for a fact?

361
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:10,808
It was an accident.

362
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,812
Everyone knows it.

363
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,713
I saw you at the front
of the wedding guests.

364
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:16,881
For all I know--

365
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:20,518
If you have
evidence, present it.

366
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:22,120
To whom?

367
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,924
To whom shall I
present this evidence?

368
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,459
I thought not.

369
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,563
You act like you don't know
what kind of man Ruechang is.

370
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,199
Well, I do.

371
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:37,035
I've told you what
I'm going to do.

372
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:38,436
What you're going
to do is up to you.

373
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:47,245
It doesn't matter what
you think of Ruechang.

What matters is-- you won't
survive out here alone.

00:30:57,121 --> 00:31:01,593
All right, I'll
go back with you.

Get my dress.

377
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,297
It belonged to my mother.

378
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,837

going to jog away.

379
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:15,873

I'm OK.

I'm fine, Princess.

00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:19,870

[crickets chirping]

00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:46,330
You lost a lot of blood.

443

Can't keep saving
you, you know?

444
00:37:58,743 --> 00:37:59,810
Where are we?

445
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,912
I took us another day
further from the city.

446
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,222
We go to get you
back to the city.

447
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:15,259
I told you, I'm
not going back,

448
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,694
not without an army behind me.

449
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:24,902
You fought well
in the mud pit.

450
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:29,573
I don't know what
you're talking about.

451
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,615
You cheated.

452
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:40,718
You threw mud in my face.

453
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:46,157
With all due respect,
Princess, how did I cheat?

454
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:50,628
Did I break any rules?

455
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,196
No.

456
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:55,066
But what you did was--

457
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,101
was without honor.

458
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:58,569
I wasn't looking for honor.

459
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,770
I was looking to win.

460
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:05,476
But if you're going to
go up against Ruechang,

461
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:09,647
I suggest you learn
that lesson well

462
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:13,851
because I assure you he has.

463
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:16,153
So you think the rebels
will rally behind

464
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,823
you and bring Ruechang down?

465
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:20,191
Yes, I do.

466
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,026
Don't you think that if they
could have brought him down

467
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,161
he would have fallen long ago?

468
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:28,299
If I joined the rebels, they
will be on the side of right.

469
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:32,436
[sighs] You think
that'll make a difference?

470
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,539
My father told me there
are two men to never fight,

471
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:36,874
the man who doesn't
care if he loses

472
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:41,078
and the man who
knows he's right.

473
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:42,847
And you know you're right.

474
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:43,681
And

475
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:44,982
I don't care if I die trying.

477
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,628
I'm sorry, Princess.

478
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,697
You talk about dying,
but right now the people

479
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,699
need a queen, not a martyr.

480
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:06,070
Tomorrow morning we go back.

the city for a chopper.

485
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,800
Who the hell do you think you
are, throwing orders around?

486
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:14,071
It doesn't work
that way out here.

487
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:16,607
What have you got there, hm?

488
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:20,611
We might be able to
work something out.

491
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:28,519
Call a chopper.

492
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,058
Those men were afraid of you.

493
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:38,662
One obviously wasn't.

494
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,901
He is now.

495
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,703
Then he'll keep
his hands to himself.

496
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,347
As soon as I give
birth to his first born,

497
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,382
Ruechang sits on the throne.

498
00:41:58,482 --> 00:41:59,717
I won't live a day after that.

499
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:07,825
Do you know what kind of
life you're condemning me to?

500
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:09,193
Why are you so
loyal to Ruechang?

501
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:19,670
He's the general.

502
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,205
That's it, he's the general?

503
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:24,975
That's it.

504
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,810
He's the general.

505
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:31,382
If I told you he was
crazy, if he's a murderer,

506
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:32,983
would that make a difference?

507
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:50,768
When I was 10, Ruechang
saved me from the work chains,

508
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:52,202
put me in the military house.

509
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:58,375
So you think he
did you a favor

510
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:00,010
by turning you into a killer?

511
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:06,750
All men are killers.

512
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:10,521
He simply made me a good one.

Well, I got us up, didn't I?

Where are we going.

554
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:12,222
Right now I just want to make
sure we're not being followed.

555
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:29,306
CHOPPER 2 PILOT (ON RADIO):
Chopper 2 to Warchild.

556
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,474
Turn the chopper around and--

557
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,408
Hang on.

558
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:45,689
CHOPPER 2 PILOT: We repeat,
turn around and return to base.

559
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:48,825
We will not hesitate to
shoot and bring you down.

560
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:50,427
Return to base.

561
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:02,973
This is your final warning.

562
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:05,042
Next time, we will shoot.

563
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:06,209
Return to base.

564
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,847
You have been warned.

565
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,115
Prepare to receive fire.

566
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:19,990
That was a warning shot.

567
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,526
We can bring you
down at any time.

568
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:25,562
Return to base or
we will disable you.

569
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:33,136
PRINCESS HALO: Ah.

570
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:50,053
Oh.

571
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:55,425
We're hit.

572
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:57,427
We're losing fuel.

573
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:59,796
We're going down.

574
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:01,198
CHOPPER 2 PILOT:
You've been disabled.

575
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:03,200
Land the chopper now.

576
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,769
Land the chopper
now and surrender.

577
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:09,773
It's not over

578
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:11,341
Thank you, Warchild.

579
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,690
[panting]

580
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:27,691
Let's go.

581
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:49,846
CHOPPER 2 PILOT: We do not
wish to harm the Princess.

582
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:51,248
[gunfire]

583
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:53,450
SOLDIER: Hold your position.

584
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,451
Halt!

585
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:55,819
[gunfire]

586
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:01,224
CHOPPER 2 PILOT: You're trapped.

587
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:02,159
You cannot escape.

588
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:04,594
Drop your arms!

589
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:06,163
Surrender the Princess.

590
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,569
[horses whinnying]

591
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:16,139
[men shouting]

592
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:24,548
[gunfire]

593
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:52,943
MAN: Hey, I know this one.

594
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:54,878
That's Warchild.

595
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:55,879
VARIOUS MEN: Warchild.

596
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,457
[horse nickering]

597
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:42,759
[indistinct chatter]

598
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:01,278
[spitting]

599
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:26,703
Welcome to the
revolution, Princess Halo.

600
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:35,545
No harm comes to that man.

601
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:37,080
He risked his life
and threw away

602
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:41,184
any hope of returning to the
city with Ruechang in power.

603
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:42,519
They say the only
thing that killed more

604
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:45,121
rebels than hunger is Warchild.

605
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:47,223
He was a soldier
obeying orders.

606
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:49,659
How do you know
he still isn't?

607
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:50,594
I know.

608
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:55,432
Where's the rebel force?

609
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:58,335
You saw it as you came in.

610
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:00,203
That's it, those
men out there?

611
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:02,606
That's it.

612
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:03,873
What did you expect to find?

613
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:08,378
An army.

614
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:14,117
Don't look so sad, Princess.

615
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:15,819
Hope isn't lost.

616
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,954
There isn't a man or woman
out there that wouldn't

617
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:20,323
give their life for the cause.

618
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:23,093
And when the people learn
that you've joined us,

619
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:25,195
then you shall have your army.

620
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:27,130
That's where you're mistaken.

621
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,832
What do you mean?

622
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,134
I haven't joined
the revolution yet.

623
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:34,771
If any harm comes to that
soldier, I walk out of here.

624
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:38,842
Are you all right?

625
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:39,776
I'm fine.

626
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:50,654
Well, looks like you're
gonna live another day.

627
00:54:57,527 --> 00:55:00,664
Many will join when
they learn you have.

628
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:04,768
I believe even some of the
soldiers will come over.

629
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:07,570
But these people,
they lack any kind

630
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:10,674
of leadership or direction.

631
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:12,042
Well, that's what
you're here for.

632
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,343
[children shouting]

633
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:14,844
I don't know anything
about waging a war.

634
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,484
What is it, soldier?

635
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:22,585
What's on your mind?

636
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:30,493
Ruechang knows
where you are now.

637
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:32,295
He'll be here within 48 hours.

638
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:33,830
That's crazy.

639
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:37,600
He searched for us for months,
and he's never come close.

640
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:39,569
He came close yesterday.

641
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,538
And I guarantee you
that as we speak,

642
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:42,505
he's getting even closer.

643
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:43,840
How much more of this--

644
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,008
He's right.

645
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:46,810
He does know where we are.

646
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:48,311
He'll never give up.

647
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:49,479
York, I'm telling you--

648
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:53,850
Robert, they're right.

649
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:55,518
Camp must move.

650
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:57,287
We'll meet Ruechang another day.

651
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:58,888
There's only one
problem with that, though.

652
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:04,461
You can't kill Ruechang.

653
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,500
But I can.

654
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,435
SOLDIER: All right,
let's move it.

655
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,204
Load 'em up.

656
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:17,607
Chopper will find the camp
covered from the air, sir.

657
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:22,378
SOLDIER: Get those
trucks rolling.

658
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:26,149
All right, let's
lock and load, boys.

659
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:28,518
Right.

660
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:30,120
[children singing]

661
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:35,692

662
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:58,348

663
00:56:58,448 --> 00:56:59,949
[crickets chirping]

664
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:05,588
See anything up
there, soldier?

665
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:13,530
Are you still planning on
leaving in the morning?

666
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,102
At dawn.

667
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,040
I've been thinking it over.

668
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:24,974
I don't think you should.

669
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:39,088
But it's the best hope.

670
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:41,424
I've changed my mind.

671
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:43,893
I think you're too
valuable to us.

672
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:49,199
These people, they need someone
who knows the art of war.

673
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,099
That's you.

674
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,505
[scoffs] If I bring
down Ruechang, there

675
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:56,973
won't be a need for any war.

676
00:57:57,073 --> 00:57:59,275
We can't afford to
lose you right now.

677
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:00,476
Princess, we can't--

678
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:02,378
This is not a discuss.

679
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,513
It's a command.

680
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:08,685
You will not leave
in the morning.

681
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:14,524
What do you think
you're doing, soldier?

682
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,755
CHILD: I can't find it.

683
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:48,758
We'll be moving several
days south of here.

684
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:51,728
But with luck on your
side, it won't matter.

685
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,032
Sir?

686
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,239
[laughter]

687
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:04,841
Take this.

688
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:08,945
My father said it
would bring good luck.

689
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,713
Thank you.

690
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:14,684
But soldier, I want it back.

691
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:28,064
CHILD: No, you stop it!

692
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:31,067

01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:07,830
Go!

738
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:08,764
Go!

739
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:23,412
[groaning]

740
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:34,390
Ah!

741
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:50,373
Move on.

742
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:51,374
I'll take it!

743
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,382
[grunting]

744
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:02,752
[panting]

745
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:17,666
Colonel, back off!

746
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:23,639
I gave you life.

747
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:26,942
Only I can take it away.

748
01:07:27,042 --> 01:07:28,911
No!

749
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:31,347
Don't kill him, General.

750
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:34,683
Let him walk free
and I'll marry you.

751
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:37,586
I'll marry you in front
of the entire city.

752
01:07:37,686 --> 01:07:38,821
No.

753
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:40,356
Don't, Princess, don't!

754
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:49,432
Ruechang, the throne
will be yours by right.

755
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:50,332
Just let him go.

756
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:05,014
Walk away.

757
01:08:05,114 --> 01:08:07,983
Walk away.

758
01:08:08,083 --> 01:08:09,852
Don't make me come
after you myself.

759
01:08:09,952 --> 01:08:12,755
[panting]

760
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:15,624
Go soldier.

761
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:21,864
Please, if you
love me, you'll go.

762
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:14,783
Good.

763
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:36,772
[horse nickering]

764
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:05,968
Easy.

765
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:06,902
Take it easy.

766
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:08,070
Slow it down.

767
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:11,173
Are you sure he went this way?

768
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:12,308
Hold it.

769
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:18,347
Our friend is setting us up.

770
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:21,217
All right, listen up.

771
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:23,519
Crew, you stand by the Jeep--

772
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:24,320
OK

773
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,555
--in case he doubles back.

774
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:27,690
Roman?

775
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:28,624
Yeah?

776
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:32,995
You head down
the trail that way.

777
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:34,863
- Right.
- Keep your eyes open.

778
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:35,798
OK.

779
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:58,320
[bugs buzzing]

780
01:10:59,221 --> 01:11:01,323

781
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:11,300
[gun clicking]

782
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:21,076
Ah!

783
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:41,063
[whistles]

784
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:41,997
Hm?

785
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:49,938
WARCHILD: Emmerich?

786
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:55,177
You come down!

787
01:11:55,277 --> 01:11:56,178
Son of a bitch.

788
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:59,081
WARCHILD: Emmerich?

789
01:11:59,181 --> 01:12:02,051
I don't want to kill you.

790
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:04,053
You're so full
of shit, Warchild.

791
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:10,893
Look, you don't want to kill me.

792
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,961
I don't want to kill you.

793
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:15,531
But I don't, Ruechang
will have my head.

794
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:33,849
From this distance, I'd say
the scope won't be necessary.

795
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:37,619
EMMERICH: [gulp]

796
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:41,590
Like I said, I don't
want to kill you, Emmerich.

797
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:45,661
Well, that's convenient
because I'm in really no mood

798
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:46,595
to die.

799
01:12:49,732 --> 01:12:50,766
Go back to Ruechang.

800
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:56,572
Tell him you succeeded
in your mission.

801
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:58,440
We've got to come up
with a plan, partner.

802
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:06,148
You know as well as I do I
can't go back to Ruechang

803
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:08,617
without proof.

804
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:18,026
[panting] I still
say I can take you.

805
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:30,439
General, sir.

806
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:41,250
Well?

807
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:44,787
The trader's no
longer with us.

808
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:46,455
I thought you might want this.

809
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:07,042
What do you want?

810
01:14:10,546 --> 01:14:12,447
I came to talk.

811
01:14:12,548 --> 01:14:13,615
I've nothing to say to you.

812
01:14:17,686 --> 01:14:19,822
Princess, I know
you must think

813
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:23,125
I'm marrying you for power.

814
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:26,094
But it's only half true.

815
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:27,362
I just know that I--

816
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,064
There will never be
any love between us.

817
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:33,635
It's Warchild, isn't it?

818
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:41,610
You're dreaming
of a dead soldier.

819
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:51,286
Tomorrow we'll be married.

820
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:56,959
We can build dream
or a nightmare.

821
01:14:57,059 --> 01:14:57,893
Your choice.

822
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:26,889

823
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:29,892

[indistinct chatter]

825
01:15:52,414 --> 01:15:53,215
Halt!

826
01:15:57,986 --> 01:15:58,820
Sir.

827
01:16:01,623 --> 01:16:02,624
Let them pass.

828
01:16:07,129 --> 01:16:08,030
MAN: All right.

829
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:08,797
CHILD: Mommy?

830
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:09,998

831
01:16:10,098 --> 01:16:12,801

[military music]

834
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:41,096
Princess!

835
01:16:41,196 --> 01:16:43,231
What are you doing?

836
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:44,633
What is this?
Fine.

837
01:16:44,733 --> 01:16:45,567
Let me taste it.

838
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:46,468
No.

839
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:49,137
No, Lily.

840
01:16:49,237 --> 01:16:50,038
I'm sorry.

841
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:55,410
[church bells ringing]

842
01:17:16,598 --> 01:17:18,567
Go to the wedding.

843
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:19,768
I'll check her room.

844
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:20,902
Watch your back.

845
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:29,378

846

[grunting] Help.

848
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:32,407
No time, my Lord, no time.

849
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:36,178
The Princess plans to
kill Ruechang and herself.

850
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:40,415
- How?
- The wine-- the wine, my Lord.

851
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:51,993
[organ playing]

852
01:19:36,838 --> 01:19:38,807
Remove your veil that
all may see the girl

853
01:19:38,907 --> 01:19:40,108
about to become a woman.

854
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:57,325
Before the joining of these
two, let them share wine.

855
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:18,046
After you, my dear.

856

857
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:38,300
Oh!

858
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,268
MAN: Is it Warchild?

859
01:20:40,368 --> 01:20:42,704
What's he doing?

860
01:20:42,804 --> 01:20:45,607
Warchild!

861
01:20:45,707 --> 01:20:47,609
(LOUDLY) Ruechang is a murderer!

862
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:49,411
[crowd gasping]

863
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:54,583
He murdered my father,
killed your king!

864
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:55,584
It's true!

865
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:56,551
I saw him do it!

866
01:20:56,651 --> 01:20:58,386
[shocked murmurs from crowd]

867
01:20:58,486 --> 01:21:00,355
Kill him!

868
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:01,723
All right, nobody move!

869
01:21:01,823 --> 01:21:02,724
Nobody move.

[shocked sounds from crowd]

871
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:07,395
All right, everybody,
stay where you are.

872
01:21:07,495 --> 01:21:08,363
Nobody gets hurt.

873
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:17,873
Her father was a good
man and a good king.

874
01:21:17,973 --> 01:21:19,040
You murdered him.

875
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:28,516
You want to die for a butcher?

876
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,355

Get in there!

Warchild.

890
01:22:54,436 --> 01:22:57,739
Shoot him.

It's about to explode!

901
01:26:34,389 --> 01:26:37,859
You'd better get out of here.

903
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:50,238
