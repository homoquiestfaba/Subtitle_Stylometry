00:07:22,737 --> 00:07:23,501
crush, Mia.

188
00:07:23,607 --> 00:07:24,858
[singing] --crying out murder.

189
00:07:24,962 --> 00:07:28,021
And I'd just laugh and get away with it too.

190
00:07:28,124 --> 00:07:31,705
I predict the next big thing about Jen Wilson--

191
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:34,937
her fast food ass.

192
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:38,377
ABBY: Ooh, mom, let me tell you all about amazing day.

193
00:07:38,482 --> 00:07:39,351
It wasn't amazing.

194
00:07:39,456 --> 00:07:40,673
It was school.

195
00:07:40,777 --> 00:07:41,610
Huh?

196
00:07:41,715 --> 00:07:42,584
All right.

197
00:07:42,688 --> 00:07:43,418
How bout after school?

198
00:07:43,522 --> 00:07:47,624
Did you reboot the job hunt?

199
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:49,222
Hey.

200
00:07:49,326 --> 00:07:50,334
Getting a job was your idea.

201
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:53,289
I'm not forcing you to do this.

202
00:07:53,393 --> 00:07:56,695
However, if you want to keep going out

203
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,607
with your friends, and shopping, and stuff like that,

204
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,274
you are going to have to do something.

205
00:08:00,378 --> 00:08:01,421
Fine.

206
00:08:01,527 --> 00:08:02,464
Then I won't go out with my friends anymore.

207
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:03,472
[scoffs] You won't?

208
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:04,411
Whatever.

209
00:08:04,515 --> 00:08:06,809
I don't care.

210
00:08:06,913 --> 00:08:10,841
Mia, this is not an answer.

211
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:13,169
So I've become a model.

212
00:08:13,273 --> 00:08:15,847
(LAUGHING) What?

213
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:17,480
I know, it's insane, right, because I'm

214
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:19,808
some ugly, disgusting monster.

215
00:08:19,913 --> 00:08:20,608
Honey.

216
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:22,241
Of course not.

217
00:08:22,345 --> 00:08:23,945
That's not it at all.

218
00:08:24,048 --> 00:08:26,133
Just that being a model means doing things

219
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:29,749
like wearing makeup and dresses that aren't black, you know,

220
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:33,433
things that I didn't think you really wanted to do.

221
00:08:33,537 --> 00:08:34,858
Well, somebody wants me to.

222
00:08:38,055 --> 00:08:38,994
You were scouted?

223
00:08:42,052 --> 00:08:44,416
Is this something you want to try?

224
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,030
Well, it beats flipping burgers, right?

225
00:08:48,135 --> 00:08:50,429
So are you an agent or a photographer?

226
00:08:50,534 --> 00:08:51,645
Both.

227
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,174
You've probably seen it before.

228
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,955
Agencies ask for money up front for headshots.

229
00:08:56,059 --> 00:08:57,137
That's a complete scam.

230
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:59,466
No reputable agency would do that.

231
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,308
But when I sign a girl, I do it because I

232
00:09:01,412 --> 00:09:02,664
believe in her talent.

233
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:06,174
So I build her portfolio in house free of charge.

234
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:07,495
Any success stories?

235
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,685
Depends on how you define success.

236
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:13,334
My girls work print, runway, internet,

237
00:09:13,438 --> 00:09:14,585
commercials, everything.

238
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:15,524
Magazines?

239
00:09:15,628 --> 00:09:17,192
Definitely.

240
00:09:17,296 --> 00:09:19,382
Mia, why don't you head back and get ready for a few test shots?

241
00:09:19,486 --> 00:09:20,911
The makeup room is right over there.

242
00:09:21,015 --> 00:09:22,336
And Simone's expecting you.

243
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,100
Great.

244
00:09:23,204 --> 00:09:24,213
MALCOLM: OK.

245
00:09:24,317 --> 00:09:25,847
Go to my office.

246
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:26,715
ABBY: OK.

247
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,574
[girls laughing and chatting]

248
00:09:36,482 --> 00:09:37,316
MIA: Hi.

249
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,289
GIRL: Hi.

250
00:09:38,393 --> 00:09:39,436
Uh, I'm Mia.

251
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,244
Malcolm wants me to get, like, test shots.

252
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:42,043
GIRL: Hi, Mia.

253
00:09:42,147 --> 00:09:42,981
GIRL: Hi, Mia.

254
00:09:43,086 --> 00:09:44,302
Hi, Mia.

255
00:09:44,407 --> 00:09:46,666
So are you joining Malcom's beauty cult?

256
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:48,786
GIRL: You should totally join our family.

257
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,470
You'd make so much money with that face and that figure.

258
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,545
So Malcom's not some creep?

259
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,588
GIRL: No.

260
00:09:58,692 --> 00:10:00,500
He's, like, totally respectful.

261
00:10:00,604 --> 00:10:01,715
Some of us think he's gay.

262
00:10:01,821 --> 00:10:04,809
He's not gay.

263
00:10:04,913 --> 00:10:06,825
Mia, ass in chair.

264
00:10:06,928 --> 00:10:08,389
Got a lot of work to do.

265
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:09,362
Now.

266
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:21,179
So have I passed your test?

267
00:10:21,284 --> 00:10:23,613
Well, would you just let your daughter sign with a stranger?

268
00:10:23,718 --> 00:10:24,586
MALCOLM: No.

269
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,871
Actually, I wouldn't.

270
00:10:25,975 --> 00:10:27,610
Too many shady people in this world.

271
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:30,529
Well, you don't have to tell me.

272
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:31,884
Preying on people's dreams--

273
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:36,612
Well, I would rather make dreams come true.

274
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:38,940
Try this.

275
00:10:39,044 --> 00:10:41,964
And this.

276
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:44,953
MIA: Are you a model or just a stylist?

277
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:47,317
Simone was Malcolm's first model.

278
00:10:47,421 --> 00:10:51,314
She started all this, like, years, and years,

279
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:53,086
and years, and years ago.

280
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:55,659
I'm not neolithic.

281
00:10:55,763 --> 00:10:57,813
I'm 19 and holding.

282
00:10:57,917 --> 00:10:59,273
[scoff]

283
00:11:00,385 --> 00:11:05,182
I'm only 22, actually.

284
00:11:05,286 --> 00:11:06,120
MALCOLM: It is.

285
00:11:06,224 --> 00:11:08,066
Yeah.

286
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:10,047
Not a problem at all.

287
00:11:10,151 --> 00:11:10,881
You know what?

288
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:12,863
Le me call you back. OK?

289
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:13,871
[beep]

290
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:20,579
Have you ever been a model?

291
00:11:20,684 --> 00:11:21,587
[scoffs] Please.

292
00:11:21,692 --> 00:11:22,942
Come on, Abby.

293
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:24,437
Good bone structure doesn't fade.

294
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,797
Listen, I know that Mia's beautiful.

295
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:32,362
And I'm not just saying that as a mother.

296
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:34,968
But honestly, most agencies wouldn't have looked twice.

297
00:11:35,072 --> 00:11:37,123
Mm-hm.

298
00:11:37,228 --> 00:11:40,530
I have seen hundreds of girls, Abby--

299
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:41,954
pretty, beautiful.

300
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:45,709
But there has to be something more, something--

301
00:11:45,813 --> 00:11:47,898
something that Mia just has.

302
00:11:48,002 --> 00:11:48,871
She's going to be a star.

303
00:11:52,242 --> 00:11:53,355
OK.

304
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:55,684
Malcolm, I so want a raise for this.

305
00:11:55,788 --> 00:11:56,623
Mia.

306
00:11:59,194 --> 00:12:01,106
ABBY: Oh, honey.

[exhales]

308
00:12:02,705 --> 00:12:03,748

a mix of sun and clouds.

315
00:12:20,222 --> 00:12:22,586
As far as the winds are concerned, not too bad.

Explain.

Listen, I know this isn't very glamorous,

351

but you start small so when the bigger campaigns come along,

you're ready for them.

353
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,063

And you know what?

361
00:14:09,636 --> 00:14:10,818
I think someone like Mia.

362
00:14:10,922 --> 00:14:12,139
How does that sound?

363
00:14:12,243 --> 00:14:13,043
KARL: I didn't tell you to put your arm up.

364
00:14:13,147 --> 00:14:14,120
Just put it down.

365
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:15,303
Just put your arm down.

366
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:16,450
Just do what I say, and this'll go

367
00:14:16,554 --> 00:14:17,700
a lot quicker for both of us.

368
00:14:17,804 --> 00:14:18,673
Got it?

If you want Mia to do something, ask her,

372

don't bark at her.

373
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:27,259
Excuse me?

374
00:14:27,363 --> 00:14:30,422
I think you heard me.

375
00:14:30,526 --> 00:14:31,464
Yeah, all right. Take five.

376
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:32,437
Relax.

377
00:14:32,543 --> 00:14:33,550
That's a good idea.

378
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:35,288
Come here.

379
00:14:35,392 --> 00:14:37,060
- Sorry if I screwed that up. - You didn't.

380
00:14:37,164 --> 00:14:37,998
You're doing great.

381
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:39,181

00:14:41,787 --> 00:14:42,829
Listen.

383
00:14:42,934 --> 00:14:44,395
I thought maybe you could use an advance.

384

Oh, my god.

385
00:14:53,187 --> 00:14:55,482

Wow.

387
00:14:57,219 --> 00:14:59,026
That's a lot of money to get up front so soon.

You know what?

389
00:15:00,348 --> 00:15:02,050
It just shows my faith in your daughter

390

and her bright future as a model.

391
00:15:05,074 --> 00:15:10,427
So my advice-- go celebrate, but not until you're through.

392
00:15:10,531 --> 00:15:11,643
MIA: (LAUGHING) Yeah.

393
00:15:11,747 --> 00:15:13,312
Of course. Thank you, Malcolm.

394
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:14,285
You're welcome.

We haven't been here forever.

398
00:15:39,796 --> 00:15:41,743
I would love to see his face if he just,

399
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:44,662
like, walking in here right now.

400
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:45,844
He'd be shocked.

401
00:15:45,948 --> 00:15:48,138
We actually don't need him.

402
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:49,981
Not that he'd care.

403
00:15:50,085 --> 00:15:51,648

404
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:53,734
He does.

405
00:15:53,838 --> 00:15:58,877
No, dad only wants me when he wants to hurt you, right?

406
00:15:58,982 --> 00:15:59,816
Oh, my god.

You tell the truth?

No, I was fighting with your dad.

412
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:16,847
You know, I was trying to hurt him, not you.

413
00:16:16,951 --> 00:16:18,793
He doesn't always show it, honey.

414
00:16:18,898 --> 00:16:20,324
But he does care.

You need some help.

Hey, look, I know we're on opposite sides of the argument.

But you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours, right?

[laughs] Maybe.

426
00:16:55,984 --> 00:16:57,201
I mean, about the help, not the back-scratching thing.

00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:57,107
Yeah.

557
00:22:57,213 --> 00:22:58,428
Off you go.

558
00:22:58,534 --> 00:23:00,131

00:23:36,592 --> 00:23:39,372
With wings like yours, the sky's the limit.

563
00:23:39,476 --> 00:23:40,693
Sincerely, Gabriel."

564
00:23:43,196 --> 00:23:44,134
Any luck?

565
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:47,053
I'm getting nothing over here.

566
00:23:47,157 --> 00:23:48,096
Hey.

567
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,695
Would you ever put a pic of yourself

568
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,894
on the net for, like, a personal ad or something?

569
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,875
I thought your heart belonged to Justin.

570
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:56,716
And my liver, lungs, and spleen.

571
00:23:56,821 --> 00:23:58,523
Come here.

572
00:23:58,628 --> 00:24:02,556
If this involves you and a horse, I don't want to see it.

573
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,223
What's this?

574
00:24:04,328 --> 00:24:05,684
MIA: It's like an online portfolio.

575
00:24:05,788 --> 00:24:07,700
It's for execs and industry people.

576
00:24:07,804 --> 00:24:09,159
It's another way to get my face known.

577
00:24:09,264 --> 00:24:10,411
[typing]

578
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:11,766
What are you doing?

579
00:24:11,871 --> 00:24:12,809
CHELSEA: Well, I want to see your pictures.

580
00:24:12,913 --> 00:24:13,643
What's you password, Mia Model?

581
00:24:13,748 --> 00:24:14,720
Oh, forget it.

582
00:24:14,825 --> 00:24:15,833
It's jabberwocky, isn't it?

583
00:24:15,937 --> 00:24:17,744
It's always jabberwocky.

584
00:24:17,849 --> 00:24:21,567
But out of respect for your fragile ego, fine.

585
00:24:21,673 --> 00:24:22,680
So be honest.

586
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,209
Do you think it's freaky or not?

587
00:24:24,313 --> 00:24:25,774
All the models have one?

588
00:24:25,878 --> 00:24:27,198
Mm-hm.

589
00:24:27,302 --> 00:24:28,206
Then no.

590
00:24:28,311 --> 00:24:29,353
Looks professional to me.

593
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,519
our fellow students to support a dress code,

594
00:25:03,624 --> 00:25:06,056
but it's either that or I'll be staring

595
00:25:06,161 --> 00:25:09,115
at ass floss and plumber butt till the day we graduate.

596
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:12,243
So just give me your petitions, and we'll see how

597
00:25:12,347 --> 00:25:14,120
many more signatures we need.

598
00:25:14,224 --> 00:25:15,233
Thanks.

Mia.

00:25:23,818 --> 00:25:25,869
If this wasn't an assigned debate topic,

601
00:25:25,972 --> 00:25:27,780
I wouldn't even want to be talking about this anymore.

602
00:25:27,884 --> 00:25:28,927
It's so boring.

603
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:35,078
The Mia I thought I knew would have found it important.

604
00:25:35,183 --> 00:25:36,434
It'll be full tomorrow.

605
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:37,372
I promise.

608
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:44,080
I am eating.

609
00:25:44,185 --> 00:25:45,644
A salad.

610
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,460
If this is about the petition, I already told you.

611
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:49,433
I know.

612
00:25:49,537 --> 00:25:51,345
But no one's signing it.

613
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,082
So maybe we should let it go.

614
00:25:53,187 --> 00:25:54,682
It's a great thing to debate, but there

615
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:56,628
are way bigger problems.

616
00:25:56,732 --> 00:25:58,296
Like?

617
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,617
I don't know.

618
00:25:59,722 --> 00:26:01,877
Underfunding, class sizes.

619
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,336
Yeah, a student petition's really going

620
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,727
to sway government funding.

621
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:06,534
Look, this is something we can actually change.

622
00:26:06,638 --> 00:26:08,966
I mean, it affects every girl in the school,

623
00:26:09,071 --> 00:26:10,322
including you, including me.

624
00:26:10,427 --> 00:26:11,990
OK, fine.

Where are you going?

Hi.

00:26:21,306 --> 00:26:24,398
I'm, um, collecting names for a petition.

629
00:26:24,503 --> 00:26:25,337
And--

630
00:26:25,441 --> 00:26:27,179
What?

631
00:26:27,284 --> 00:26:30,098
Well, I'm trying to get names for a petition

632
00:26:30,202 --> 00:26:32,602
in favor of the proposed dress code.

634
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:37,503
Whatever.

635
00:26:37,607 --> 00:26:38,684
I don't think so.

636
00:26:46,469 --> 00:26:47,408
MIA: OK.

00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,636
Right here.

Malcolm, hi.

Listen, I was thinking, before I went and spent

652
00:27:24,598 --> 00:27:26,614
my entire savings on DVDs, I should ask

653
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:28,490
you out for a cup of coffee.

654
00:27:28,596 --> 00:27:30,193
Is now a good time?

655
00:27:30,297 --> 00:27:31,376
Yeah.

656
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,217
MALCOLM: So how long have you worked there?

657
00:27:33,321 --> 00:27:34,400
Not too long.

658
00:27:34,504 --> 00:27:37,249
Mia's dad and I split up a couple years ago.

659
00:27:37,354 --> 00:27:39,231
A mortgage doesn't pay for itself.

660
00:27:39,335 --> 00:27:40,760
You ever thought of selling the house?

661
00:27:40,864 --> 00:27:43,680
Huh, every day.

662
00:27:43,784 --> 00:27:45,973
The divorce was pretty hard on Mia.

663
00:27:46,077 --> 00:27:48,511
So you don't want to uproot on top of everything else.

664
00:27:48,615 --> 00:27:50,353
I understand.

665
00:27:50,457 --> 00:27:51,744
Well, I hope the past few weeks have

666
00:27:51,847 --> 00:27:53,028
been a good change for her.

667
00:27:53,133 --> 00:27:54,280
Oh.

668
00:27:54,385 --> 00:27:56,331
She doesn't dress like a funeral director anymore.

669
00:27:56,435 --> 00:27:58,695
MALCOLM: Well, that's always a positive sign.

670
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:00,049
Mm.

671
00:28:00,153 --> 00:28:03,526
She's got more, I don't know, pride in herself.

672
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,020
Still mouthy as hell.

673
00:28:05,124 --> 00:28:06,584
And she's all right with the website?

674
00:28:06,688 --> 00:28:09,434
Because she was a bit concerned at first.

675
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:10,998
Should I be concerned?

676
00:28:11,102 --> 00:28:11,937
Mia didn't tell you?

677
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:12,979
Mm-hm.

678
00:28:13,084 --> 00:28:14,718
Yeah, I have a website for my agency.

679
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:16,769
Showcases all the models.

680
00:28:16,872 --> 00:28:20,347
Think of it like a headshot, only digital.

681
00:28:20,453 --> 00:28:21,704
It's industry standard.

682
00:28:21,807 --> 00:28:23,720
I will give you the web address, and you

683
00:28:23,823 --> 00:28:25,839
can check it out for yourself.

684
00:28:25,943 --> 00:28:26,847
Hm.

685
00:28:26,951 --> 00:28:28,064
I'll have Mia show me.

686
00:28:28,168 --> 00:28:29,350
MALCOLM: OK.

687
00:28:29,455 --> 00:28:30,706
Thank you for being concerned with her.

688
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:31,505
Well.

689
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:34,008
It's very decent of you.

690
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,596
Ah-ah!

691
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,264
20 minutes has turned into 30.

692
00:28:40,368 --> 00:28:41,654
I've got to get back to work.

693
00:28:41,757 --> 00:28:42,662
Please, yeah.

694
00:28:42,766 --> 00:28:45,338
Let me get your coat.

695
00:28:45,442 --> 00:28:46,971
Oh, thank you.

696
00:28:50,586 --> 00:28:51,942
JUSTIN: Hey.

697
00:28:52,046 --> 00:28:53,992
Hey.

698
00:28:54,096 --> 00:28:57,399
So tonight, what are you up to?

699
00:28:57,503 --> 00:29:00,562
Well, It's Friday, so me, Chelsea,

The Masquerade.

702
00:29:03,481 --> 00:29:05,740
It's a live-action RPG.

703
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,443
A role-playing game.

704
00:29:07,548 --> 00:29:09,286
Sounds fun.

705
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:14,047
But how bout you join me at a live-action party instead?

706
00:29:14,151 --> 00:29:16,341
Uh-uh-uh, I guess I could get out of it.

707
00:29:16,446 --> 00:29:18,044
Maybe Chelsea could come too?

708
00:29:18,148 --> 00:29:21,695
Actually, I can't get out of it, so, uh, have a good time.

709
00:29:24,718 --> 00:29:25,829
OK.

710
00:29:25,934 --> 00:29:28,472
I'll pick you up at 7:00-ish then?

711
00:29:28,576 --> 00:29:30,105
Sure.

712
00:29:30,209 --> 00:29:31,287
JUSTIN: All right.

713
00:29:31,391 --> 00:29:34,380
MIA: OK.

714
00:29:34,485 --> 00:29:36,882
[phone ringing]

715
00:29:36,987 --> 00:29:38,968
WOMAN: Hi, this is [inaudible]

716
00:29:39,072 --> 00:29:40,984
JAMES: I did that search for Angel you wanted.

717
00:29:41,088 --> 00:29:42,513
You're not going to believe what I found.

718
00:29:46,302 --> 00:29:48,561
I mean, where are these girls' parents?

719
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:49,881
Their daughters are up in their rooms,

720
00:29:49,986 --> 00:29:51,689
telling every perv out there with a modem,

721
00:29:51,793 --> 00:29:53,323
here I am, come get me.

722
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:55,894
Yeah, parents are Luddites.

723
00:29:55,999 --> 00:29:58,502
I want a full report on that site, James.

724
00:29:58,606 --> 00:29:59,579
Pronto.

725
00:29:59,682 --> 00:30:00,553
OK.

726
00:30:09,345 --> 00:30:12,057
Oh, I wanted to tell you, Malcolm stopped by work

727
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:13,829
just to check on.

728
00:30:13,934 --> 00:30:14,698
We had coffee.

729
00:30:14,802 --> 00:30:17,096
- Was it a date? - No.

730
00:30:17,201 --> 00:30:18,348
Wish it was a date?

731
00:30:18,452 --> 00:30:19,426
Mia.

732
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,537
Come on.

733
00:30:20,642 --> 00:30:22,900
He's hot.

734
00:30:23,005 --> 00:30:25,473
It would drive dad crazy.

735
00:30:25,578 --> 00:30:29,609
Anyway, he mentioned to me about your website.

736
00:30:29,713 --> 00:30:30,721
Are you worried about it?

737
00:30:30,825 --> 00:30:32,355
No.

738
00:30:32,459 --> 00:30:35,379
No, I've just got to get used to seeing my picture anywhere.

739
00:30:35,483 --> 00:30:36,526
And so do you.

740
00:30:42,261 --> 00:30:45,075
Oh, honey.

741
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,501
MIA: See?

742
00:30:46,605 --> 00:30:48,655
Nothing to be worried about.

743
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:52,132
ABBY: You look beautiful.

744
00:30:52,236 --> 00:30:54,147
Well, I'd have to stay and chat,

745
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:57,310
but I've got to get ready for my date.

746
00:30:57,414 --> 00:30:59,083
Am I crazy or does it seem like things

747
00:30:59,187 --> 00:31:01,064
are actually going our way?

748
00:31:01,168 --> 00:31:02,524
You're crazy.

749
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,748
ABBY: [laughs]

750
00:31:09,232 --> 00:31:11,803
JUSTIN: Wow, what's your mouth composed of, Teflon?

751
00:31:18,616 --> 00:31:22,231
Here's to eating Japanese food in a Japanese car.

752
00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:25,845
[clink]

753
00:31:26,888 --> 00:31:28,417
Good spicy sushi.

754
00:31:28,523 --> 00:31:31,719
Cold, hard metal around us.

755
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,284
Clouded sky above.

756
00:31:36,134 --> 00:31:38,740
It's a haiku to go with all this.

757
00:31:38,845 --> 00:31:40,617
Ah.

758
00:31:40,721 --> 00:31:48,750
I think you got the beats wrong, but domo arigato, Mia-san.

759
00:31:48,854 --> 00:31:49,689
Cheers.

760
00:31:55,701 --> 00:31:58,448
Could I taste it?

761
00:31:58,552 --> 00:31:59,422
Yeah.

762
00:32:09,883 --> 00:32:11,620
You know your user ID and your password?

763
00:32:11,724 --> 00:32:12,628
- Yup. - OK.

764
00:32:12,732 --> 00:32:14,192
So go ahead and type that in.

765
00:32:14,297 --> 00:32:16,869
So a couple of ground rules, Mia.

766
00:32:16,973 --> 00:32:19,649
One, always looks like you're having fun.

767
00:32:19,753 --> 00:32:21,769
They can't hear you, but they can see you.

768
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:24,447
Two, never give out any personal information about yourself.

769
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,957
Not where you go to school, not your last name, nothing.

770
00:32:28,061 --> 00:32:30,459
And three, if anyone asks for nudity, you tell them

771
00:32:30,563 --> 00:32:32,510
you're under-age, you don't do that,

772
00:32:32,614 --> 00:32:35,046
and you'll report any more requests to the place, OK?

773
00:32:35,151 --> 00:32:36,299
Why would anyone ask for that?

774
00:32:36,403 --> 00:32:37,688
I thought this was all industry people.

775
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:38,939
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

776
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:41,407
Commercial production companies, modeling execs,

777
00:32:41,511 --> 00:32:43,320
magazine editors.

778
00:32:43,424 --> 00:32:44,292
That looks great.

779
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:45,647
You know who called today?

780
00:32:45,751 --> 00:32:47,628
The fashion editor of that European glossy.

781
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:49,262
He's going to be on this chat tonight.

782
00:32:49,366 --> 00:32:50,826
It's pretty good, huh, a good opportunity?

783
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:52,322
Yup.

784
00:32:52,426 --> 00:32:53,955
MALCOLM: A chance to build your profile, your career,

785
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:55,484
your fan base all at once.

786
00:32:55,588 --> 00:32:56,457
Fans?

787
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,777
MALCOLM: Yeah.

788
00:32:57,882 --> 00:33:00,246
You never mentioned anything about talking to fans.

789
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,636
Do you think Cindy Crawford's never

790
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,304
done a live chat before, huh?

791
00:33:03,409 --> 00:33:04,694
Come on.

792
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:06,675
If it builds your public exposure,

793
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:08,726
then it is good for business.

794
00:33:08,831 --> 00:33:10,395
OK? Trust me.

795
00:33:10,498 --> 00:33:11,541
I've been doing this for a while.

796
00:33:11,645 --> 00:33:13,314
OK. Are you ready?

797
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:14,496
- Yup. - Yeah?

798
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,573
Let me see a smile.

799
00:33:15,677 --> 00:33:16,546
Good.

800
00:33:19,604 --> 00:33:20,474
You're on.

801
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:25,236
I don't know what to do.

802
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,190
OK, type what I tell you.

803
00:33:28,295 --> 00:33:31,562
Hi, everybody, exclamation mark.

804
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:33,265
I am so excited.

805
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,620
Lots of O's.

806
00:33:34,724 --> 00:33:35,593
[punches key]

807
00:33:35,697 --> 00:33:36,880
[snaps fingers] Come on.

808
00:33:36,984 --> 00:33:38,235
Hey, hey, smile and look straight ahead.

809
00:33:42,579 --> 00:33:43,900
BRITISH BOY (VOICEOVER): Mia, I think

810
00:33:44,005 --> 00:33:46,020
you're so gorgeous and hot.

811
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:46,959
Thank you.

812
00:33:47,063 --> 00:33:47,932
Star, blush, star.

813
00:33:52,381 --> 00:33:55,092
BOY (VOICEOVER): Mia, do you have a boyfriend?

814
00:33:55,197 --> 00:33:56,830
No, not at the moment.

815
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,221
Sad face.

816
00:33:58,325 --> 00:33:59,228
What?

817
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:01,486
Give a little sexy sad face.

818
00:34:06,736 --> 00:34:09,168
BOY (VOICEOVER): What do you look for in a guy?

819
00:34:09,273 --> 00:34:12,853
Shy, quiet, smart, funny, no muscle-bound jocks.

820
00:34:12,957 --> 00:34:14,418
- That's not exactly true. - It doesn't matter.

821
00:34:14,521 --> 00:34:16,120
They don't know that. Keep smiling.

822
00:34:16,225 --> 00:34:17,093
Keep smiling.

823
00:34:17,198 --> 00:34:18,379
There you go.

824
00:34:18,483 --> 00:34:19,805
BOY (VOICEOVER): Hey, that's me exactly.

825
00:34:23,246 --> 00:34:24,983
BOY (VOICEOVER): Mai, I am so your type.

826
00:34:25,087 --> 00:34:26,790
BOY (VOICEOVER): Will you marry me?

827
00:34:26,894 --> 00:34:28,390
MIA: [laughs]

828
00:34:28,493 --> 00:34:31,517
They worship you, Mia.

829
00:34:31,621 --> 00:34:32,490
[message pings]

830
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:36,522
Can I do that, kiss?

831
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:37,739
Yeah, they would love that.

832
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:40,103
Do you have lipstick?

833
00:34:40,207 --> 00:34:41,284
- Yeah. - OK.

834
00:34:41,388 --> 00:34:42,744
So put some on.

835
00:34:51,016 --> 00:34:53,310
And then just blow the guy a kiss.

836
00:35:04,814 --> 00:35:06,171
[sighs]

837
00:35:06,275 --> 00:35:09,333
[clattering]

838
00:35:09,437 --> 00:35:10,479
BOY (VOICEOVER): Oh, my god!

839
00:35:10,584 --> 00:35:11,800
BOY (VOICEOVER): That was awesome!

840
00:35:11,905 --> 00:35:13,260
BOY (VOICEOVER): I think I'm going to faint.

841
00:35:13,365 --> 00:35:14,685
BOY (VOICEOVER): Wow. BOY (VOICEOVER): More, more!

842
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:15,727
MALCOLM: You've got an exam coming up.

843
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:16,876
Yes, what are you going to do?

844
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,578
You gonna fail? Who's in trouble?

845
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,664
Who's got detention? Yes, you do.

846
00:35:20,768 --> 00:35:24,175
[music playing]

847
00:35:38,042 --> 00:35:41,205
MIA: [inaudible] so they can go back to this clown.

848
00:35:45,723 --> 00:35:48,122
MALCOLM: Someone's throwing sand in your face.

849
00:35:48,226 --> 00:35:49,442
OK, there's a shark in the water.

850
00:35:49,546 --> 00:35:50,277
A shark!

851
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,910
[chuckles] Excellent.

852
00:35:52,014 --> 00:35:56,047
[music playing]

853
00:36:23,122 --> 00:36:25,103

854
00:36:25,207 --> 00:36:28,231
[pinging]

855
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:57,357
SIMONE: "Mia, you should be in Hollywood."

856
00:36:57,462 --> 00:37:02,467
[laughs] "You're the first thing I think about when I wake up,

857
00:37:02,571 --> 00:37:07,541
the last thing before I go to bed."

858
00:37:07,645 --> 00:37:10,183
Mia thinks someone needs to get a life.

859
00:37:13,623 --> 00:37:16,023
God, how many members do you have?

860
00:37:16,127 --> 00:37:19,323
I broke the 1,500 mark after my last chat.

861
00:37:19,427 --> 00:37:22,105
Word must be getting around the industry.

862
00:37:22,209 --> 00:37:25,823
Sounds like somebody's getting hot.

863
00:37:25,928 --> 00:37:27,805
Membership numbers go up and down.

864
00:37:27,909 --> 00:37:29,299
It's no big deal.

865
00:37:29,403 --> 00:37:32,566
Oh, my god, somebody's requesting an actual interview?

866
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,930
What?

867
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:36,320
Really?

868
00:37:36,424 --> 00:37:37,954
SIMONE: Oh, it's bogus.

869
00:37:38,058 --> 00:37:41,220
How many professionals spell "professional" with two F's?

870
00:37:41,324 --> 00:37:42,332
It's called a typo.

871
00:37:42,437 --> 00:37:44,940
It's called a cyber troll.

872
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:46,538
Gabriel contacts all the new girls

873
00:37:46,643 --> 00:37:48,623
around here and then goes psycho, completely

874
00:37:48,729 --> 00:37:49,806
gets off on scaring us.

875
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:54,047
Well, he hasn't been psycho with me.

876
00:37:54,151 --> 00:37:55,714
Look, a little word of advice.

877
00:37:55,818 --> 00:37:58,148
Keep your contact with Gabriel and the rest of your members

878
00:37:58,251 --> 00:37:59,398
strictly virtual.

879
00:37:59,502 --> 00:38:01,136
OK?

880
00:38:01,241 --> 00:38:02,492
Funny.

881
00:38:02,596 --> 00:38:06,315
I was wondering how you lost all your members.

882
00:38:06,419 --> 00:38:08,192
Have fun filling out the restraining order.

883
00:38:12,711 --> 00:38:13,614
[beep]

884
00:38:14,761 --> 00:38:17,751

889
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:58,903
All right, this is starting to get scary.

890
00:38:59,007 --> 00:39:00,153
[laughs]

891
00:39:00,257 --> 00:39:01,544
How much longer do I have to do this?

892
00:39:01,648 --> 00:39:02,308
Calm down.

893
00:39:02,413 --> 00:39:03,490
It's only been 20 minutes.

894
00:39:03,594 --> 00:39:04,603
[sighs] Ah-ah-ah!

895
00:39:04,707 --> 00:39:05,541
OK.

896
00:39:05,645 --> 00:39:08,079
[laughs] And--

897
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:09,052
Ah!

898
00:39:12,214 --> 00:39:14,960
Happy birthday.

899
00:39:15,064 --> 00:39:19,965
You get a massage, a facial, a manicure, and a pedicure,

900
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:24,240
a complete new makeup regime, and after, you get

901
00:39:24,344 --> 00:39:26,325
to rest overnight at the hotel.

902
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:27,786
What?

903
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:31,957
And for dessert, two rounds of Botox, not that you need them.

904
00:39:32,061 --> 00:39:38,386
[exhales] Honey, this is, uh-- this is amazing.

905
00:39:38,491 --> 00:39:41,792
But how could you possibly afford it?

906
00:39:41,897 --> 00:39:43,913
Uh, I just did a bunch of stuff for this cruise

907
00:39:44,018 --> 00:39:46,519
wear thingy. ABBY: Thingy?

908
00:39:46,623 --> 00:39:49,023
Like a magazine or a catalog.

909
00:39:49,126 --> 00:39:50,586
Oh, Malcolm mentioned that.

910
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:54,514
You never told me you got that job.

911
00:39:54,618 --> 00:39:56,634
So when do we get to see something?

912
00:39:56,738 --> 00:39:57,607
This is big.

913
00:39:57,711 --> 00:39:58,754
I know.

914
00:39:58,858 --> 00:40:00,282
The tear sheets have to come in from Berlin.

915
00:40:00,387 --> 00:40:01,639
It takes a while.

916
00:40:01,743 --> 00:40:03,585
And Malcolm helped out with this too, you know?

917
00:40:03,689 --> 00:40:05,149
He gets discounts at all these places.

918
00:40:08,938 --> 00:40:10,884
And I owe you for everything, mom.

919
00:40:10,988 --> 00:40:12,031
So just--

920
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:17,036
Honey.

921
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,078
Mm.

922
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,929
This is so sweet.

923
00:40:21,033 --> 00:40:21,902
Thank you.

924
00:40:22,007 --> 00:40:22,876
[laughter]

925
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,849
So go have fun.

926
00:40:23,953 --> 00:40:25,134
I know I will.

927
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,072
OK.

928
00:40:26,177 --> 00:40:27,428
Oh, hey, uh, no parties.

929
00:40:27,533 --> 00:40:28,645
Mom, stop stressing.

930
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,897
Worry lines-- not good.

[baby crying in background]

936
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:38,576
Uh-uh-uh, hi, it's Mia.

937
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,104
Is my dad there?

938
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:41,531
WOMAN (ON PHONE): Um.

939
00:41:41,635 --> 00:41:43,059
Well-- uh, hold on, Mia.

943
00:42:04,018 --> 00:42:05,199
Justin.

944
00:42:05,303 --> 00:42:06,242
JUSTIN (ON PHONE): Hey, I'm just about a block away.

945
00:42:06,346 --> 00:42:07,563
I'll be right there.

JUSTIN: Oh, I gotta go.

952
00:43:02,757 --> 00:43:04,217
Is everything OK?

953
00:43:04,321 --> 00:43:05,398
Yeah.

954
00:43:05,503 --> 00:43:06,267
I'm fine.

955
00:43:06,372 --> 00:43:08,562
Just, uh, give me a minute, OK?

956
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:09,501
Sure.

957
00:43:14,609 --> 00:43:15,895
Nice. All right.

958
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:17,042
That's it for the day.

959
00:43:17,146 --> 00:43:18,746
Before you all go, though, I have a couple

960
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:20,170
announcements I want to make.

961
00:43:20,274 --> 00:43:23,924
First, next Saturday is our annual company party.

962
00:43:24,028 --> 00:43:26,739
Costumes, as usual.

963
00:43:26,844 --> 00:43:31,015
And as usual, I've invited a few of our most loyal customers.

964
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,926
Do you mean we have to meet these guys?

965
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,186
It's no big deal, Mia.

966
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:37,062
I only invite a select few who I've

967
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:38,104
gotten to know over the years.

968
00:43:38,209 --> 00:43:39,183
OK?

969
00:43:39,287 --> 00:43:40,155
They're totally nice.

970
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,337
Don't worry.

971
00:43:41,441 --> 00:43:42,589
MALCOLM: There you go.

972
00:43:42,694 --> 00:43:45,995
And second, a new record has been set.

973
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:48,185

977
00:43:54,892 --> 00:43:57,500
2,145 paying members.

978
00:43:57,604 --> 00:44:00,105
It's a testament to all your hard work and dedication.

979
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:01,358
Congrats, Mia. - Thanks.

980
00:44:01,462 --> 00:44:02,469
GIRL: Good for you.

00:44:02,574 --> 00:44:06,710

MALCOLM: Listen, don't worry about next Saturday.

984
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:10,950
Don't worry?

985
00:44:11,054 --> 00:44:12,514
Yeah.

986
00:44:12,618 --> 00:44:14,253
I have something to show you.

987
00:44:23,637 --> 00:44:24,540
See?

988
00:44:24,645 --> 00:44:26,661
Oh, I've dealt with this guy, Mia.

989
00:44:26,766 --> 00:44:29,371
[inaudible] Just ignore him, OK?

990
00:44:29,476 --> 00:44:30,970
He was threatening me.

991
00:44:31,074 --> 00:44:33,404
MALCOLM: 'Cause he gets off on scaring you.

992
00:44:33,508 --> 00:44:34,828
He wants a reaction, Mia.

993
00:44:34,932 --> 00:44:36,218
It makes him feel like he's a part of your life.

994
00:44:36,322 --> 00:44:41,536
But if you ignore him, I promise he'll go away.

995
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:44,596
OK?

996
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:45,603
[inhales]

997
00:44:45,707 --> 00:44:49,495
Look at it this way.

998
00:44:49,601 --> 00:44:51,686
Every famous person has a stalker.

999
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:56,204
Stalkers, ultimately, means you've made it.

1000
00:44:56,308 --> 00:44:57,769
Do you know how long it took Simone to get

1001
00:44:57,872 --> 00:44:59,193
the kind of numbers you get?

1002
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:00,166
This is crazy.

1003
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:01,487
I've never seen anything like it.

1004
00:45:01,591 --> 00:45:03,468
And that's the tip of the iceberg.

1005
00:45:03,573 --> 00:45:09,585
I see magazines, TV commercials, acting if you want.

1006
00:45:09,689 --> 00:45:10,905
Really?

1007
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:11,844
Yeah.

1008
00:45:16,953 --> 00:45:19,491
You're a star, kid.

1009
00:45:19,596 --> 00:45:21,473
So start acting like one.

1010
00:45:21,577 --> 00:45:22,654
OK.

1011
00:45:22,757 --> 00:45:23,904

[singing] Sexy little thighs, the way that she moves

1015
00:45:29,328 --> 00:45:30,370
just gets to me.

1016
00:45:30,475 --> 00:45:32,906
Keeps shaking that thing and making me sing.

1017
00:45:33,011 --> 00:45:34,783
She got just what I like.

1018
00:45:34,888 --> 00:45:37,600
Every day of the week, my baby's so sweet.

00:45:38,954 --> 00:45:40,520
Hey, Mia, what are you-- what are you doing later?

[singing] We'll do it all night.

1022
00:45:42,257 --> 00:45:43,161
Your game is so tight.

1023
00:45:43,265 --> 00:45:44,134
This girl, she got me shook.

I'm a guy.

1026
00:45:46,532 --> 00:45:48,305
A dress code really won't affect me,

1027
00:45:48,409 --> 00:45:50,042
but it will affect you, Chelsea.

1028
00:45:50,146 --> 00:45:52,058
I don't understand why you support that.

1029
00:45:52,163 --> 00:45:54,179
For the hundredth time, Justin,

1030
00:45:54,283 --> 00:45:57,307
socializing girls our age to wear revealing clothing

1031
00:45:57,411 --> 00:45:59,774
is actually more oppressive than a dress code.

1032
00:45:59,878 --> 00:46:03,319
I'm not saying that every girl should dress like Britney.

1033
00:46:03,424 --> 00:46:05,022
You have the power to choose.

1034
00:46:08,325 --> 00:46:11,174
It's a free country.

1035
00:46:11,279 --> 00:46:13,226
Just ask your partner.

1036
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:14,164
Tuh.

1037
00:46:14,268 --> 00:46:15,520

1038
00:46:15,624 --> 00:46:16,770
GIRL: What?

1039
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:17,847
I hope there's a point to this, Mia.

1040
00:46:17,952 --> 00:46:18,785

1042
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:22,018
Yes, I take off my coat and all Justin

1043
00:46:22,123 --> 00:46:23,305
can do is stare at my breasts.

1044
00:46:23,409 --> 00:46:24,695
JUSTIN: Well, when you're wearing that--

1045
00:46:24,799 --> 00:46:25,738
Exactly.

1046
00:46:25,842 --> 00:46:26,815
And you're right.

1047
00:46:26,919 --> 00:46:28,380
We should be able to wear what we want.

1048
00:46:28,484 --> 00:46:30,534
Well then, I'm glad you agree with my argument.

1049
00:46:30,638 --> 00:46:32,758
I'd agree with you if we lived in a utopia,

1050
00:46:32,863 --> 00:46:35,052
but we live in a society where girls are constantly

1051
00:46:35,157 --> 00:46:38,771
under pressure from magazines, from music videos,

1052
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:42,247
from television, from boys. We're surrounded by it.

1053
00:46:42,352 --> 00:46:43,950
And the message is always the same-- if you

1054
00:46:44,055 --> 00:46:46,174
want to fit in, look sexy.

1055
00:46:46,279 --> 00:46:48,226
If you need validation from your male peers,

1056
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,171
then dress like a porn star.

1057
00:46:50,277 --> 00:46:51,354
And you're right.

1058
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:53,509
Girls sometimes like to dress sexy.

1059
00:46:53,613 --> 00:46:58,201
But be prepared, because if you do, you're a slut.

1060
00:46:58,305 --> 00:47:01,815
It's contradictory, it's unfair, and it's a reality that girls

1061
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:03,310
are faced with every day.

1062
00:47:03,414 --> 00:47:04,597
GIRL: Yeah!

1063
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,543
We get enough of it in our malls and in our homes.

1064
00:47:06,646 --> 00:47:07,863
It has no place in our schools.

1065
00:47:07,967 --> 00:47:08,871
[applause]

1066
00:47:08,975 --> 00:47:09,878

[cheers]

1068
00:47:16,691 --> 00:47:17,387
Oh, my god!

1069
00:47:17,491 --> 00:47:18,776
Chelsea, did you see that?

1070
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,036
We had them eating out of the palms of our hands.

1071
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,739
Yeah, 'cause the guys are trying to figure

1072
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:24,617
out how to get into your pants.

1073
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,075
Chelsea.

1074
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,579
All my research, all my preparation.

1075
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:29,864
I shouldn't have bothered.

1076
00:47:29,968 --> 00:47:31,949
I should have just dressed like a stripper.

1077
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:36,989
Well, I thought the point was to win.

1078
00:47:37,094 --> 00:47:38,901
Being a little whore is not the point.

1079
00:47:39,006 --> 00:47:39,978
OK, I'm a whore? Fine.

1080
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:41,056
But you?

1081
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,551
You're invisible because what guy

1082
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:44,810
would even look at some bitter, ugly, backstabbing nun?

1083
00:47:58,607 --> 00:47:59,582
OK.

1084
00:47:59,685 --> 00:48:01,841
What are you trying to hide? - Nothing.

1085
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:03,475
Just a mushy email from Justin.

1086
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:04,969
None of your business.

1087
00:48:05,073 --> 00:48:05,907
Hey, so wow!

1088
00:48:06,012 --> 00:48:07,784
Look at you!

1089
00:48:07,888 --> 00:48:09,695
Can't frown and half my face is numb,

1090
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:14,458
but if it makes me look 10 years younger, I'm not complaining.

1091
00:48:14,562 --> 00:48:16,021
Eh, let me just see one line.

1092
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:16,855
No.

1093
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,002
Honey, come on, it's c--

1094
00:48:18,107 --> 00:48:19,532
Mom, I'm serious.

1095
00:48:19,635 --> 00:48:21,513
Don't.

1096
00:48:21,617 --> 00:48:22,452
Oh.

1097
00:48:22,556 --> 00:48:24,606
Must be some email.

1098
00:48:24,711 --> 00:48:27,561
I'll meet you downstairs You have to be at Malcom's at 7:00.

1099
00:48:27,665 --> 00:48:28,534
Yep.

1100
00:48:40,698 --> 00:48:41,881
OK, guys.

1101
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:43,549
I want you on your best behavior tonight.

1102
00:48:43,653 --> 00:48:45,912
Now all of our clients are important, of course,

1103
00:48:46,017 --> 00:48:47,580

a phony dream like this, Mia?

1282
01:00:42,878 --> 01:00:46,493
We just want to know if he's done anything illegal.

1283
01:00:46,598 --> 01:00:48,475
Has-- has he given you drugs?

1284
01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:51,360
Has he had any sexual relations?

1285
01:00:51,464 --> 01:00:52,611
Has he ever crossed any line?

1286
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:53,550
No!

1287
01:00:56,782 --> 01:00:58,624
But you wish he had?

1288
01:00:58,728 --> 01:00:59,597
Oh man, no!

1289
01:00:59,702 --> 01:01:00,571
No, of course not!

1290
01:01:04,045 --> 01:01:05,402
That girl from the mall?

1291
01:01:05,506 --> 01:01:08,876
They found her body yesterday.

1292
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:10,684
Is this worth the money?

1293
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:13,257
Really?

1294
01:01:13,361 --> 01:01:16,801
She was a model just like you.

1295
01:01:16,905 --> 01:01:17,982
You know, I'm going to go.

1296
01:01:28,688 --> 01:01:30,009
MALCOLM: All right, that's very good.

1297
01:01:30,113 --> 01:01:31,434
A little more, just like that.

1298
01:01:31,538 --> 01:01:33,033
Your best smile, Simone.

1299
01:01:33,137 --> 01:01:34,493
Excellent, you're lava!

1300
01:01:34,598 --> 01:01:36,091
Scorching!

1301
01:01:36,196 --> 01:01:38,525
Couple more just like that.

1302
01:01:38,629 --> 01:01:39,498
There you go.

1303
01:01:39,603 --> 01:01:40,818
Keep that smile.

1304
01:01:40,922 --> 01:01:42,626
Let me see that smile, Simone-- there!

1305
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:43,564
Very hot.

1306
01:01:43,669 --> 01:01:44,538
There, you see that?

1307
01:01:44,643 --> 01:01:46,900
Here it is.

1308
01:01:47,005 --> 01:01:50,655
SIMONE: Is it possible to get some goddamn privacy in here?

1309
01:01:59,657 --> 01:02:03,167
Get out of here, Mia, I don't want to hear it.

1310
01:02:03,271 --> 01:02:04,523
What were we doing?

1311
01:02:04,627 --> 01:02:06,295
I'm over 18, Mia.

1312
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,451
It's legal.

1313
01:02:08,555 --> 01:02:15,089
Besides, I can't keep letting my membership slip, right?

1314
01:02:15,193 --> 01:02:16,756
Simone, you're a model, not a--

1315
01:02:16,862 --> 01:02:17,696
Wake up, Mia!

1316
01:02:17,799 --> 01:02:19,016
None of us are models!

1317
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,581
It's a scam!

1318
01:02:20,685 --> 01:02:25,238
Malcolm's never made anyone famous and he never will.

1319
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:26,941
But all those magazine covers.

1320
01:02:27,045 --> 01:02:29,096
SIMONE: [scoffs] It's called Photoshop.

1321
01:02:32,015 --> 01:02:35,248
So all this just leads to porn?

1322
01:02:35,353 --> 01:02:37,056
Leads to porn?

1323
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:40,114
Mia, what do you think you're doing now?

1324
01:02:40,218 --> 01:02:42,998
No legitimate agency would make you pose online.

1325
01:02:43,102 --> 01:02:46,301
So your members, they're not talent scouts or modeling

1326
01:02:46,405 --> 01:02:48,108
agents, they're just guys.

1327
01:02:48,212 --> 01:02:55,581
Gross, greasy, perverted guys with calluses on their palms.

1328
01:02:55,685 --> 01:02:57,874
God, even Bridget figured it out faster.

1329
01:03:00,342 --> 01:03:03,818
Yeah, well at least I don't spread my legs for web geeks.

1330
01:03:03,922 --> 01:03:04,791
Not yet.

1331
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:11,881
MALCOLM: Mia!

1332
01:03:11,986 --> 01:03:12,890
Mia.

1333
01:03:12,994 --> 01:03:14,488
Hey, Mia!

1334
01:03:14,594 --> 01:03:15,914
Hey!

1335
01:03:16,018 --> 01:03:17,652
That was Simone's decision, OK?

1336
01:03:17,755 --> 01:03:18,590
Not mine.

1337
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:20,258
So you need to calm down,

1338
01:03:20,362 --> 01:03:22,031
At least Simone knew she was doing this.

1339
01:03:22,135 --> 01:03:24,290
MALCOLM: Hey hey hey hey-- that is not fair.

1340
01:03:24,394 --> 01:03:26,167
I've never made you do anything you didn't want to do

1341
01:03:26,271 --> 01:03:28,391
or anything illegal, have I?

1342
01:03:28,496 --> 01:03:29,886
Have I?

1343
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:30,824
So.

1344
01:03:30,928 --> 01:03:31,797
You're going to quit?

1345
01:03:31,901 --> 01:03:33,014
Is that what this means?

1346
01:03:33,118 --> 01:03:34,405
I don't know.

1347
01:03:34,509 --> 01:03:35,378
I need to think.

1348
01:03:35,482 --> 01:03:36,525
Yeah you do.

1349
01:03:36,629 --> 01:03:38,402
Long and hard.

1350
01:03:38,506 --> 01:03:39,861
Because you are really talented, Mia.

1351
01:03:39,965 --> 01:03:41,460
I never lied to you about that.

1352
01:03:41,564 --> 01:03:42,919
Malcolm, I can't do this right now.

1353
01:03:43,024 --> 01:03:45,769
OK, OK.

1354
01:03:45,874 --> 01:03:46,812
Can I give you a ride home?

1355
01:03:46,917 --> 01:03:47,750
How--

1356
01:03:47,855 --> 01:03:49,211
No.

1357
01:03:49,315 --> 01:03:50,844
No, I'll just talk to you tomorrow.

1358
01:03:50,948 --> 01:03:51,817
OK.

1359
01:03:57,135 --> 01:04:00,124
[cell ring]

1360
01:04:01,862 --> 01:04:03,808
Hello?

1361
01:04:03,913 --> 01:04:05,685
Hello!

1362
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:07,111
Who is-- who is this?

1363
01:04:12,325 --> 01:04:15,313
[cell ring]

1364
01:04:16,426 --> 01:04:18,789
Hello?

1365
01:04:18,893 --> 01:04:20,804
Try a 1-900 number, freak!

1366
01:04:27,548 --> 01:04:28,486
[cell ring]

1367
01:04:28,591 --> 01:04:29,599
What do you want?

1368
01:04:51,773 --> 01:04:53,199
MALCOLM: Hey, Mia, it's Malcolm again.

1369
01:04:53,303 --> 01:04:55,144
Listen, I'm just checking in to see how you're doing.

1370
01:04:55,249 --> 01:04:57,334
Nothing to worry, cause that was Gabriel last night,

1371
01:04:57,439 --> 01:04:59,072
but listen-- that could've been anyone.

1372
01:05:22,706 --> 01:05:24,583
- Did you do this? - No, I--

1373
01:05:28,373 --> 01:05:29,276
Who else knows about it?

1374
01:05:29,381 --> 01:05:30,424
Did you tell anyone?

1375
01:05:30,528 --> 01:05:31,431
No!

1376
01:05:31,535 --> 01:05:32,577
Well who else could have seen it?

1377
01:05:32,681 --> 01:05:33,760
I-- I don't know.

1378
01:05:33,864 --> 01:05:35,045
No one was around, I--

1379
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:36,574
I was.

1380
01:05:36,679 --> 01:05:38,591
Me and my credit card.

1381
01:05:38,695 --> 01:05:41,788
Best 25 bucks I've ever spent.

1382
01:05:41,893 --> 01:05:43,909
Just say charge it to your under-aged whore cam.

1383
01:05:56,317 --> 01:05:59,549
Which is more MIa, the blue or the pink?

1384
01:05:59,653 --> 01:06:00,349
Neither.

1385
01:06:00,453 --> 01:06:02,677
She doesn't wear scarves.

1386
01:06:02,782 --> 01:06:03,790
Are you here to explain?

1387
01:06:06,292 --> 01:06:08,934
Look, I don't know who the guy was, he just took off.

1388
01:06:09,038 --> 01:06:11,714
But Mia was never in any danger, OK?

1389
01:06:11,818 --> 01:06:12,756
What are you talking about?

1390
01:06:12,861 --> 01:06:13,834
Abby, trust me.

1391
01:06:13,939 --> 01:06:14,772
It's all under control.

1392
01:06:14,876 --> 01:06:16,233
What's under control?

1393
01:06:16,337 --> 01:06:18,596
First there's all this money and now she's in danger?

1394
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:19,917
OK, you know what?

1395
01:06:20,021 --> 01:06:22,906
We'll continue this conversation once you've calmed down.

1396
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:24,435
Malcolm!

1397
01:06:24,539 --> 01:06:25,581
Wait a minute!

1398
01:06:29,579 --> 01:06:30,622
Malcolm!

1399
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,349
What is going on?

1400
01:06:35,454 --> 01:06:37,296
What is Mia doing for you that she's making all this money?

1401
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,320
And why is she refusing to tell me anything?

1402
01:06:40,424 --> 01:06:41,778
You better start telling me the truth

1403
01:06:41,883 --> 01:06:43,169
or I'm going to go to the police!

1404
01:06:46,992 --> 01:06:48,175
You know, Abby, maybe you should

1405
01:06:48,279 --> 01:06:49,669
have asked all those questions before you

1406
01:06:49,773 --> 01:06:51,963
went and got your face paralyzed on your daughter's dime.

1407
01:06:52,067 --> 01:06:52,936
Hmm?

1408
01:07:01,868 --> 01:07:02,876
Hey.

1409
01:07:08,403 --> 01:07:11,323
Let me guess, you saw them.

1410
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:12,435
Who hasn't?

1411
01:07:16,362 --> 01:07:21,263
Well, I thought you were all girls can wear what they want?

1412
01:07:21,368 --> 01:07:25,190
So you wanted to dress like a slut and do soft porn?

1413
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:32,037
You know-- hate me all you want,

1414
01:07:32,142 --> 01:07:34,228
but before I started dressing like this,

1415
01:07:34,332 --> 01:07:37,008
you wouldn't even talk to me.

1416
01:07:37,112 --> 01:07:39,684
That's not true.

1417
01:07:39,788 --> 01:07:41,805
Really.

1418
01:07:41,909 --> 01:07:45,176
Well one thing's for sure, you never asked me out.

1419
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,227
You're no different than any of those creeps

1420
01:07:47,331 --> 01:07:48,964
trolling my site.

1421
01:07:49,068 --> 01:07:50,215
This is the Mia you want.

1422
01:07:53,482 --> 01:07:54,421
Not anymore.

1423
01:08:05,751 --> 01:08:06,411
Mia!

1424
01:08:06,516 --> 01:08:07,384
Where are you going?

1425
01:08:07,489 --> 01:08:08,531
Came to see Malcolm.

1426
01:08:08,637 --> 01:08:10,062
He's busy with a mom right now.

1427
01:08:10,166 --> 01:08:11,069
So?

1428
01:08:11,174 --> 01:08:12,702
Well, a new girl's getting a tour.

1429
01:08:12,808 --> 01:08:15,658
We all get a bonus if we rope her in, so just play ball, OK?

1430
01:08:15,762 --> 01:08:16,979
Come on!

1431
01:08:17,083 --> 01:08:19,099
SIMONE: Alysha, that top is way too slutty.

1432
01:08:22,192 --> 01:08:25,598
Mia, just sit down and pretend to read.

1433
01:08:31,471 --> 01:08:33,800
OK, you guys know the drill.

1434
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,127
Um, Malcolm told me to come here?

1435
01:08:40,231 --> 01:08:40,891
ALL: Hi!

1436
01:08:40,995 --> 01:08:42,142
I'm Stephanie.

1437
01:08:42,247 --> 01:08:43,567
ALL: Hi, Stephanie!

1438
01:08:43,671 --> 01:08:47,564
SIMONE: So, you're joining Malcolm's Beauty Calls?

1439
01:08:47,668 --> 01:08:50,414
BRIDGET: You should totally join our family.

1440
01:08:50,518 --> 01:08:53,022
You'd make so much money with that face!

1441
01:08:53,126 --> 01:08:53,994
Oh, and that figure?

1442
01:08:57,193 --> 01:08:58,895
Is Malcolm OK?

1443
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,571
He's like totally respectful.

1444
01:09:01,675 --> 01:09:03,378
Some of us even think he's gay.

1445
01:09:03,482 --> 01:09:06,229
SIMONE: He's not gay.

1446
01:09:06,332 --> 01:09:08,732
Stephanie, come sit in my chair, we have some work to do.

1447
01:09:12,068 --> 01:09:13,215
What do you think of Malcolm?

1448
01:09:20,166 --> 01:09:21,731
Ask Simone.

1449
01:09:21,835 --> 01:09:23,746
She knows the real Malcolm better than anyone.

1450
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:28,369
Right.

1451
01:09:28,473 --> 01:09:31,531
I do, so, um, ask away.

1452
01:09:34,174 --> 01:09:36,189
Your daughter really has something--

1453
01:09:36,294 --> 01:09:37,858
Malcolm!

1454
01:09:37,962 --> 01:09:39,699
We need to talk now.

1455
01:09:39,804 --> 01:09:41,889
Mia, you can see I'm with somebody.

1456
01:09:41,993 --> 01:09:42,863
I don't care.

1457
01:09:42,967 --> 01:09:45,573
Now.

1458
01:09:45,677 --> 01:09:47,485
This would just take a second, Mrs. Walker.

1459
01:09:47,589 --> 01:09:48,945
There's some magazines out here.

1460
01:09:56,001 --> 01:09:57,495
I quit.

1461
01:09:57,599 --> 01:09:59,129
Surprise, surprise.

1462
01:09:59,233 --> 01:10:00,207
Did you get my messages?

1463
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:02,049
This isn't just about Gabriel.

1464
01:10:02,153 --> 01:10:04,342
You lied to me and you lied to that girl and her mother

1465
01:10:04,446 --> 01:10:05,907
and I don't want to be part of it anymore.

1466
01:10:06,011 --> 01:10:06,914
OK.

1467
01:10:07,018 --> 01:10:08,027
Fine.

1468
01:10:08,131 --> 01:10:10,564
I will send your last check in the mail.

1469
01:10:10,668 --> 01:10:11,919
That's it?

1470
01:10:12,024 --> 01:10:14,561
You're not the only pretty girl out there.

1471
01:10:14,665 --> 01:10:16,994
I will survive.

1472
01:10:17,099 --> 01:10:20,435
And my website will come down today.

1473
01:10:20,539 --> 01:10:23,667
Mia, you signed a contract releasing those photos to me.

1474
01:10:23,771 --> 01:10:24,780
For my career.

1475
01:10:24,884 --> 01:10:28,082
Where does it say that?

1476
01:10:28,186 --> 01:10:31,106
Well, then I'll ask you as a friend.

1477
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:33,052
I'm not your friend.

1478
01:10:33,156 --> 01:10:34,164
I'm your boss.

1479
01:10:34,268 --> 01:10:35,693
And I'm a businessman.

1480
01:10:35,797 --> 01:10:37,987
I've got your CDs, your videos, and I will still charge

1481
01:10:38,091 --> 01:10:39,586
people to access your archives.

1482
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:42,888
Yeah, but the people at school have already seen them.

1483
01:10:42,992 --> 01:10:44,730
Not my concern.

1484
01:10:44,834 --> 01:10:49,526
Well, it will be if I call the cops or Web Watch.

1485
01:10:49,631 --> 01:10:51,333
Go ahead.

1486
01:10:51,438 --> 01:10:53,802
I haven't done anything illegal, they'll tell you that.

1487
01:10:53,906 --> 01:10:56,477
Malcolm, please!

1488
01:10:56,582 --> 01:10:58,007
You think you can make this girl

1489
01:10:58,111 --> 01:11:01,795
go away because you suddenly decided to be respectable?

1490
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:04,785
This girl has been copied, traded, bought, sold, cut

1491
01:11:04,889 --> 01:11:07,879
and pasted, faxed, and emailed.

1492
01:11:07,983 --> 01:11:09,546
She is out there in the ether.

1493
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:12,292
And when you are 70, when you have grandchildren,

1494
01:11:12,396 --> 01:11:14,170
she'll still be out there.

1495
01:11:14,273 --> 01:11:15,281
Like to debate?

1496
01:11:15,386 --> 01:11:17,020
Want to go into politics, huh?

1497
01:11:17,124 --> 01:11:19,071
Well she will haunt you.

1498
01:11:19,175 --> 01:11:21,642
So go back to your baggy sweaters and strong opinions,

1499
01:11:21,746 --> 01:11:24,214
but the fact is, you let her out of the box.

1500
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,390
So.

1501
01:11:33,494 --> 01:11:35,684
You can spend the rest of your life trying to bury her

1502
01:11:35,788 --> 01:11:38,534
or you can become her, like Simone has.

1503
01:11:38,638 --> 01:11:40,723
It's what the whole world wants for you, Mia.

1504
01:11:40,828 --> 01:11:44,130
To be rich, and envied, and admired.

1505
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:46,736
It's not a bad thing.

1506
01:11:46,841 --> 01:11:47,884
Now I have a guest waiting.

1507
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:54,731
Thank you for your services, Mia.

1508
01:11:54,835 --> 01:11:57,998
I'm sorry, Mrs. Walker. Come on in.

1509
01:12:29,905 --> 01:12:31,329
Mia!

1510
01:12:31,434 --> 01:12:34,145
What the hell's going on?

1511
01:12:34,249 --> 01:12:35,465
Nothing.

1512
01:12:35,570 --> 01:12:36,682
I just had a bad day at school, that's all.

1513
01:12:36,786 --> 01:12:38,559
No! I want the truth.

1514
01:12:38,663 --> 01:12:39,706
Now!

1515
01:12:47,909 --> 01:12:48,848
Oh my god!

1516
01:12:52,045 --> 01:12:56,493
I can't look anymore.

1517
01:12:56,597 --> 01:12:58,997
Mia, you're better than this.

1518
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:02,263
How-- how could you possibly have let this happen?

1519
01:13:02,367 --> 01:13:04,174
Well how about you?

1520
01:13:04,278 --> 01:13:06,155
I mean, didn't you think it was strange how many nights

1521
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:08,033
I was working on my portfolio?

1522
01:13:08,136 --> 01:13:09,806
How much money I was making?

1523
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:11,717
I mean, I did one stupid flyer.

1524
01:13:11,822 --> 01:13:12,899
Right.

1525
01:13:13,004 --> 01:13:14,047
You're right, honey, you're right,

1526
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:16,200
I wasn't paying enough attention.

1527
01:13:16,304 --> 01:13:18,217
I should've looked at that website the minute

1528
01:13:18,321 --> 01:13:20,163
I heard about it.

1529
01:13:20,267 --> 01:13:24,334
Mom, I feel like an idiot, OK?

1530
01:13:24,438 --> 01:13:25,550
Honey, I don't understand.

1531
01:13:25,655 --> 01:13:26,872
I've always trusted you.

1532
01:13:29,547 --> 01:13:30,694
I was making money and life was

1533
01:13:30,799 --> 01:13:32,050
getting good for both of us.

1534
01:13:32,154 --> 01:13:33,580
You were nice to me for once.

1535
01:13:33,684 --> 01:13:34,796
What?

1536
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:35,874
Mom, all you used to do is complain

1537
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:37,298
about my hair and my clothes!

1538
01:13:37,402 --> 01:13:40,252
And then you and everyone else started to like me.

1539
01:13:40,357 --> 01:13:43,659
Mia, what other people think doesn't matter.

1540
01:13:43,763 --> 01:13:47,030
The only thing that matters is what you think about yourself.

1541
01:13:47,134 --> 01:13:49,567
OK, you are the last person who should be telling me that.

1542
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:55,058
That's it, I'm calling Malcolm and telling him that you quit.

1543
01:13:55,163 --> 01:13:57,144
And I want this website down immediately.

1544
01:13:57,248 --> 01:13:58,395
Mom!

1545
01:13:58,499 --> 01:13:59,473
And I'm going to finish by giving that lying creep

1546
01:13:59,578 --> 01:14:00,759
a big piece of my mind.

1547
01:14:00,863 --> 01:14:02,636
I already tried to quit.

1548
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:04,756
We signed the photo rights order to him.

1549
01:14:04,861 --> 01:14:07,954
We trusted him to help you become a real model.

1550
01:14:08,057 --> 01:14:09,240
I'll go to the police.

1551
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:11,499
Well, he didn't do anything illegal.

1552
01:14:11,604 --> 01:14:15,044
I already went to this internet watchdog Web Watch.

1553
01:14:15,148 --> 01:14:17,234
They work with the police and they can't do anything

1554
01:14:17,338 --> 01:14:19,041
because he's too smart.

1555
01:14:19,145 --> 01:14:21,961
Oh honey, I'll do whatever it takes.

1556
01:14:22,065 --> 01:14:23,490
I-- I work two jobs, I'll sell the house

1557
01:14:23,594 --> 01:14:24,533
to pay for a good lawyer--

1558
01:14:24,637 --> 01:14:25,715
I'll even get your father involved--

1559
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:26,758
No!

1560
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:27,731
This website is coming down--

1561
01:14:27,835 --> 01:14:29,329
No, Mom, don't tell Dad!

1562
01:14:29,434 --> 01:14:32,353
I'm serious, Mom, if he found out?

1563
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:34,056
I can get through to Malcolm, I can.

1564
01:14:34,161 --> 01:14:35,446
No no-- no way!

1565
01:14:35,551 --> 01:14:37,079
And I feel totally responsible for all this,

1566
01:14:37,185 --> 01:14:39,513
so just let me try before you go waste all that time and money,

1567
01:14:39,617 --> 01:14:40,486
OK?

1568
01:14:40,591 --> 01:14:43,545
Then we can go to plan B.

1569
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:44,518
You have until tomorrow.

1570
01:14:44,622 --> 01:14:45,839
One chance.

1571
01:14:45,944 --> 01:14:46,848
And then I am going to take care of this.

1572
01:14:46,952 --> 01:14:47,994
OK.

1573
01:15:01,027 --> 01:15:03,113
Hey.

1574
01:15:03,217 --> 01:15:05,616
Hey.

1575
01:15:05,721 --> 01:15:07,771
Life's going to really suck for a while.

1576
01:15:10,412 --> 01:15:12,254
What, really?

1577
01:15:12,359 --> 01:15:14,235
You know, In a couple of weeks,

1578
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:17,398
they'll find someone else to crucify.

1579
01:15:17,503 --> 01:15:21,569
I mean, I'm the original social outcast, I should know.

1580
01:15:21,674 --> 01:15:26,226
I was a total bitch to you.

1581
01:15:26,331 --> 01:15:27,235
You were.

1582
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,595
Sorry.

1583
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:36,167
It was just so easy to pretend that--

1584
01:15:36,271 --> 01:15:37,905
that what I was doing, what--

1585
01:15:38,008 --> 01:15:41,345
that everything I was doing was OK.

1586
01:15:41,451 --> 01:15:43,466
Hey.

1587
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:45,656
It's going to be all right.

1588
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:48,471
OK?

1589
01:15:48,576 --> 01:15:49,583
Look, all you gotta to do is make

1590
01:15:49,687 --> 01:15:51,600
that creep take down your site.

1591
01:15:51,704 --> 01:15:53,093
Tell me how and I will.

1592
01:15:56,744 --> 01:15:59,559
So, what do you all think?

1593
01:15:59,663 --> 01:16:02,791
Think I can be a model like Mia?

1594
01:16:02,896 --> 01:16:04,599
If you show off more of your ass.

1595
01:16:04,703 --> 01:16:07,518
Thanks, Christina.

1596
01:16:07,623 --> 01:16:08,456
How's this?

1597
01:16:11,445 --> 01:16:15,094
So Justin, which one's your fave?

1598
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:18,501
Is it this one?

1599
01:16:18,606 --> 01:16:21,733
Or maybe it was this one.

1600
01:16:21,838 --> 01:16:23,089
Huh?

1601
01:16:23,193 --> 01:16:25,453
CHRISTINA: Ugh, you're a bigger slut than Mia!

1602
01:16:25,557 --> 01:16:26,808
[jeering]

1603
01:16:26,911 --> 01:16:30,040
Actually, Jen, that's the pose that you're famous for.

1604
01:16:30,144 --> 01:16:32,334
Anyway.

1605
01:16:32,438 --> 01:16:33,655
Can I have a chip?

1606
01:16:33,759 --> 01:16:35,428
CHRISTINA: Sure.

1607
01:16:35,532 --> 01:16:36,991
That's great!

1608
01:16:37,096 --> 01:16:38,452
Smile at me, Stephanie!

1609
01:16:38,556 --> 01:16:39,737
Excellent!

1610
01:16:39,843 --> 01:16:41,127
Show me that sweet girl's everyone's

1611
01:16:41,232 --> 01:16:42,310
going to fall in love with.

1612
01:16:42,414 --> 01:16:43,596
There she is.

1613
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:45,821
Nice!

1614
01:16:45,924 --> 01:16:47,558
Stephanie, I still got film here.

1615
01:16:51,312 --> 01:16:52,563
Right.

1616
01:16:52,667 --> 01:16:53,536
You know what?

1617
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,796
Let's call it a day.

1618
01:16:55,899 --> 01:16:56,769
That was great. - Bye.

1619
01:16:56,872 --> 01:16:57,741
Bye.

1620
01:17:01,912 --> 01:17:02,782
So.

1621
01:17:02,885 --> 01:17:04,624
You here to beg for your job back?

1622
01:17:04,728 --> 01:17:07,335
Or you just going to deliver another threatening message

1623
01:17:07,439 --> 01:17:08,272
from your mom?

1624
01:17:11,227 --> 01:17:12,860
I want you to take down my site.

1625
01:17:15,746 --> 01:17:17,344
I'll give you all my money.

1626
01:17:17,449 --> 01:17:19,325
I'll give you everything that's in my bank account.

1627
01:17:22,071 --> 01:17:23,740
Wow.

1628
01:17:23,844 --> 01:17:25,964
You're serious.

1629
01:17:26,068 --> 01:17:27,979
Please, Malcolm.

1630
01:17:28,084 --> 01:17:30,135
2000 members, 25 bucks a month.

1631
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:33,054
You do the math, Mia, that's like over $600,000 a year,

1632
01:17:33,159 --> 01:17:33,993
so your offer?

1633
01:17:34,097 --> 01:17:37,434
It's like pocket change.

1634
01:17:37,538 --> 01:17:38,616
You won't do it.

1635
01:17:38,721 --> 01:17:40,249
No!

1636
01:17:40,354 --> 01:17:42,022
Malcolm!

1637
01:17:42,126 --> 01:17:43,238
I want it down!

1638
01:17:46,332 --> 01:17:48,279
You know, somebody made an offer,

1639
01:17:48,383 --> 01:17:50,919
an obscene amount of money for nude photos of you

1640
01:17:51,023 --> 01:17:52,101
the other day.

1641
01:17:52,206 --> 01:17:53,527
And of course, I said no.

1642
01:17:53,631 --> 01:17:55,021
Well you'd better have said no.

1643
01:17:55,125 --> 01:17:55,960
Mm-hmm.

1644
01:17:58,741 --> 01:18:02,599
But if you agree to this, I could

1645
01:18:02,703 --> 01:18:04,196
make a fortune on a one time only

1646
01:18:04,302 --> 01:18:06,109
Mia Revealed like cam show.

1647
01:18:06,213 --> 01:18:07,499
Select clientele only.

1648
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:17,369
You do 15 minutes online and the site goes down for good.

1649
01:18:17,474 --> 01:18:18,308
OK?

1650
01:18:21,472 --> 01:18:25,399
15 minutes, rest of your life--

1651
01:18:25,503 --> 01:18:26,337
What's it going to be?

1652
01:18:31,447 --> 01:18:33,741
Whoa, wait a minute-- he asked that?

1653
01:18:33,844 --> 01:18:34,749
So we can get him, right?

1654
01:18:37,563 --> 01:18:39,684
It's your word against his and right now, all you word

1655
01:18:39,788 --> 01:18:41,491
is saying is that he asked.

1656
01:18:41,596 --> 01:18:44,341
Yeah, which is against the law.

1657
01:18:44,445 --> 01:18:46,183
There's no proof.

1658
01:18:46,287 --> 01:18:48,408
So unless you were actually to go through with it,

1659
01:18:48,512 --> 01:18:49,521
you can do a sting--

1660
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:51,118
You think I should do it?

1661
01:18:51,223 --> 01:18:53,656
Well-- that decision is up to you.

1662
01:18:53,759 --> 01:18:56,472
All I'm saying is that it's a surefire way of-- of getting

1663
01:18:56,576 --> 01:18:58,105
him and closing down-- - No!

1664
01:18:58,209 --> 01:18:59,321
I can't.

1665
01:18:59,426 --> 01:19:00,677
It would be--

1666
01:19:04,605 --> 01:19:09,645
I mean, what would happen?

1667
01:19:09,748 --> 01:19:11,660
Well, uh--

1668
01:19:11,764 --> 01:19:12,842
OK, um.

1669
01:19:16,248 --> 01:19:18,577
Malcolm's going to be overjoyed at your decision.

1670
01:19:18,681 --> 01:19:22,331
And this is going to make him a lot of money.

1671
01:19:22,435 --> 01:19:24,172
Mia, this is going to be nerve wracking.

1672
01:19:24,277 --> 01:19:25,875
Yeah, I sort of got that.

1673
01:19:25,979 --> 01:19:28,135
But don't worry, we're here to support you.

1674
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:29,526
But I'll nervous!

1675
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:33,418
I don't know if I'd even be able to do it.

1676
01:19:33,523 --> 01:19:34,773
So be nervous!

1677
01:19:34,877 --> 01:19:36,198
I mean work with it!

1678
01:19:36,303 --> 01:19:39,083
If you're to calm, Malcolm will suspect something.

1679
01:19:39,188 --> 01:19:41,759
And the police and I will keep tabs on your performance

1680
01:19:41,864 --> 01:19:42,976
from our computer.

1681
01:19:43,081 --> 01:19:44,992
Nothing bad will happen.

1682
01:19:45,096 --> 01:19:46,487
You can promise that?

1683
01:19:46,592 --> 01:19:47,634
Yes.

1684
01:19:47,738 --> 01:19:49,683
You'll be out of there before you knew it.

1685
01:19:49,788 --> 01:19:51,804
And way before Malcolm got what he wanted.

1686
01:19:54,897 --> 01:19:58,512
Now, the cops can't just bust into a private business

1687
01:19:58,618 --> 01:20:00,459
or a home without a search warrant

1688
01:20:00,563 --> 01:20:03,413
unless a crime is in progress, and this would be a crime.

1689
01:20:03,518 --> 01:20:04,699
Yeah.

1690
01:20:04,803 --> 01:20:07,514
So you need to pace yourself.

1691
01:20:07,619 --> 01:20:11,198
Draw the performance out and just keep your eye on the door

1692
01:20:11,303 --> 01:20:13,805
and it'll time itself out perfectly.

1693
01:20:16,829 --> 01:20:19,818
There's no other way to do this, is there?

1694
01:20:19,922 --> 01:20:22,216
ABBY: Mia, I did some checking today.

1695
01:20:22,321 --> 01:20:24,476
I-- I talked to the police and I talked to a lawyer

1696
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:26,700
and you were right.

1697
01:20:26,804 --> 01:20:28,368
There's not much we can do.

1698
01:20:28,473 --> 01:20:31,114
Well-- no, you don't have to worry about it.

1699
01:20:31,218 --> 01:20:32,887
Malcolm's taking down the site tonight.

1700
01:20:32,991 --> 01:20:33,825
What?

1701
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:34,902
Yeah.

1702
01:20:35,007 --> 01:20:36,572
He saw how upset I was.

1703
01:20:36,675 --> 01:20:38,830
He grew a heart and he agreed.

1704
01:20:38,935 --> 01:20:39,803
Oh!

1705
01:20:39,908 --> 01:20:40,812
Honey, that's amazing!

1706
01:20:44,357 --> 01:20:45,365
We should celebrate!

1707
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:48,145
I already am with Justin.

1708
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:48,944
Oh, OK.

1709
01:20:49,049 --> 01:20:50,161
Yeah, you should go.

1710
01:20:50,265 --> 01:20:52,038
Have fun.

1711
01:20:52,142 --> 01:20:53,671
(WHISPERING) OK.

1712
01:20:53,775 --> 01:20:54,610
I'm really proud of you.

1713
01:20:58,225 --> 01:20:59,511
OK, I'll be downstairs.

1714
01:20:59,615 --> 01:21:00,484
OK.

1715
01:21:09,972 --> 01:21:12,162
If you don't stop shaking, I'm going to blind you.

1716
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:21,268
Piece of paper releases the photos back to, Mia.

1717
01:21:21,374 --> 01:21:23,041
When you finished, of course.

1718
01:21:23,145 --> 01:21:24,188
Of course.

1719
01:21:26,795 --> 01:21:30,166
So how much are these pervs paying for this performance?

1720
01:21:30,270 --> 01:21:31,453
Well, more than enough to make up

1721
01:21:31,557 --> 01:21:35,171
for the loss of your membership revenue.

1722
01:21:35,276 --> 01:21:39,551
Your archival stuff has some shelf life,

1723
01:21:39,654 --> 01:21:46,120
but, uh, our new next big thing will offset that loss.

1724
01:21:46,225 --> 01:21:48,240
Until she figures out she's working for the biggest

1725
01:21:48,345 --> 01:21:50,152
perv of them all.

1726
01:21:50,256 --> 01:21:52,863
Right.

1727
01:21:52,967 --> 01:21:55,122
We're using live streaming video today.

1728
01:21:55,227 --> 01:21:56,478
Encrypted.

1729
01:21:56,581 --> 01:21:59,015
No one can record it, including the police.

1730
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:00,092
I know all the men.

1731
01:22:00,196 --> 01:22:01,621
And seeing how they want this site up

1732
01:22:01,725 --> 01:22:05,272
and running as much as I do, they'll stay quiet.

1733
01:22:05,376 --> 01:22:06,349
I'm protected.

1734
01:22:06,453 --> 01:22:07,565
You're protected.

1735
01:22:07,669 --> 01:22:08,956
OK?

1736
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:09,928
Good.

1737
01:22:10,033 --> 01:22:11,388
We'll see you in 10.

1738
01:22:19,729 --> 01:22:21,885
You don't have to do this.

1739
01:22:25,533 --> 01:22:30,087
What would you do to make this all just go away?

1740
01:22:30,192 --> 01:22:31,999
Simone.

1741
01:22:32,104 --> 01:22:34,293
Come on, you must have dreams or something?

1742
01:22:38,706 --> 01:22:40,514
I think you need a bit more blush.

1743
01:22:51,601 --> 01:22:55,564
MALCOLM: So, don't take your clothes off all at once.

1744
01:22:55,668 --> 01:22:59,770
Five, four, three, two, one.

1745
01:23:05,297 --> 01:23:07,382
I said slowly, Mia, not paralyzed, come on.

1746
01:23:07,485 --> 01:23:08,355
Good.

1747
01:23:08,459 --> 01:23:09,294
Smile.

1748
01:23:09,398 --> 01:23:10,614
Smile.

1749
01:23:10,718 --> 01:23:12,873
There we go.

1750
01:23:12,978 --> 01:23:13,812
Nice.

1751
01:23:18,817 --> 01:23:21,180
Take the tie off.

1752
01:23:21,285 --> 01:23:23,857
And we'll take the braids out, give your hair a little shake,

1753
01:23:23,961 --> 01:23:25,108
all sexy like.

1754
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:33,553
Is Mia around?

1755
01:23:33,657 --> 01:23:35,917
She's supposed to be with you!

1756
01:23:36,021 --> 01:23:36,716
MALCOLM: Good!

1757
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:38,003
You're doing great.

1758
01:23:38,107 --> 01:23:39,428
You got a bra underneath there?

1759
01:23:39,531 --> 01:23:40,714
Good.

1760
01:23:40,818 --> 01:23:44,051
We'll take the top off, give them a taste.

1761
01:23:44,155 --> 01:23:45,928
Mia, look at me. Smile.

1762
01:23:46,032 --> 01:23:46,935
Smile.

1763
01:23:47,039 --> 01:23:48,082
Great. Good.

1764
01:23:48,186 --> 01:23:49,611
Now-- hey hey, no, look-- M-- Mia!

1765
01:23:49,715 --> 01:23:50,549
Hey, come on!

1766
01:23:50,653 --> 01:23:51,384
Face me!

1767
01:23:51,488 --> 01:23:55,694
This is OK! Good.

1768
01:23:55,798 --> 01:23:56,631
Mia, look at me.

1769
01:23:56,737 --> 01:23:57,397
Smile.

1770
01:23:57,501 --> 01:23:58,474
Mia!

1771
01:23:58,578 --> 01:23:59,587
Smile!

1772
01:24:09,388 --> 01:24:10,709
And then you're going to act surprised

1773
01:24:10,813 --> 01:24:11,751
and you cover it up, OK?

1774
01:24:11,856 --> 01:24:12,724
Mia?

1775
01:24:12,829 --> 01:24:13,663
Come on!

1776
01:24:13,767 --> 01:24:14,740
This is acting!

1777
01:24:14,845 --> 01:24:16,271
Acting.

1778
01:24:16,375 --> 01:24:18,112
Fall out of your cup, let it slip out, let it slip out.

1779
01:24:18,216 --> 01:24:19,467
Good.

1780
01:24:19,571 --> 01:24:20,684
Good, and now act surprised and cover it up.

1781
01:24:20,788 --> 01:24:22,456
Cover it up!

1782
01:24:22,561 --> 01:24:24,125
Crying ain't sexy, Mia.

1783
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:25,863
Should be easy stuff.

1784
01:24:25,967 --> 01:24:27,149
Just take the skirt off.

1785
01:24:27,253 --> 01:24:28,366
You'll be in your bra and your panties.

1786
01:24:28,469 --> 01:24:29,443
Mia, come on!

1787
01:24:29,547 --> 01:24:31,147
Hey, hey hey-- not your socks!

1788
01:24:31,251 --> 01:24:34,275
Malcolm, maybe we should just wait.

1789
01:24:34,379 --> 01:24:36,776
These guys have waited long enough, OK?

1790
01:24:36,881 --> 01:24:38,063
Take the skirt off.

1791
01:24:38,167 --> 01:24:39,210
Now.

1792
01:24:44,874 --> 01:24:46,613
We'll be in our panties and-- and our bra,

1793
01:24:46,717 --> 01:24:48,628
we'll do the big finale and it'll be over.

1794
01:24:57,005 --> 01:24:58,361
Mia, look at me.

1795
01:24:58,465 --> 01:25:00,480
Stop crying, Mia.

1796
01:25:00,585 --> 01:25:02,670
Drop the skirt.

1797
01:25:02,774 --> 01:25:05,278
Drop the skirt. Now.

1798
01:25:05,381 --> 01:25:06,945
(CRYING) I can't do this.

1799
01:25:11,256 --> 01:25:12,229
OK.

1800
01:25:12,333 --> 01:25:14,592
You know what? Get out of here.

1801
01:25:14,696 --> 01:25:15,530
Get out of here.

1802
01:25:15,635 --> 01:25:17,269
Get the hell out.

1803
01:25:17,372 --> 01:25:18,311
Get out!

1804
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:43,822
SIMONE: Mia?

1805
01:25:54,111 --> 01:25:55,293
James?

1806
01:25:55,396 --> 01:25:56,267
What happened?

1807
01:25:56,370 --> 01:25:58,350
The cops didn't show up!

1808
01:25:58,455 --> 01:25:59,707
JAMES (ON PHONE): Mia, just calm down.

1809
01:25:59,811 --> 01:26:01,966
Just take a cab here and I'll explain everything.

1810
01:26:02,071 --> 01:26:02,939
OK?

1811
01:26:16,842 --> 01:26:19,970
JAMES: It's possible the police didn't have enough manpower

1812
01:26:20,075 --> 01:26:22,056
to follow up on all the tips.

1813
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:24,802
I mean, it happens.

1814
01:26:24,906 --> 01:26:27,096
Maybe you should have told me that before I

1815
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:28,103
went and did all this.

1816
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:34,811
Do you ever read the news, Mia?

1817
01:26:34,915 --> 01:26:41,936
Seems like every day another girl goes missing.

1818
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:45,550
Sometimes they find the girl, sometimes they don't.

1819
01:26:48,018 --> 01:26:54,866
Sometimes they catch the guys, sometimes the guys get away.

1820
01:26:54,970 --> 01:26:57,021
No, the guy always gets away.

1821
01:27:02,373 --> 01:27:04,147
Feels like that to you, huh?

1822
01:27:07,483 --> 01:27:12,175
Oh, Mia, you know, that doing what I do, after a while,

1823
01:27:12,278 --> 01:27:14,782
you begin to see a pattern.

1824
01:27:14,886 --> 01:27:17,006
You begin to see the truth.

1825
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:21,907
So you can say that men are the bad guys all you want,

1826
01:27:22,011 --> 01:27:25,174
but who's tempting them in the first place?

1827
01:27:25,278 --> 01:27:27,607
Who are they tangling with?

1828
01:27:27,711 --> 01:27:32,333
You see, it's not the men who are evil, Mia.

1829
01:27:32,438 --> 01:27:33,446
It's the girls.

1830
01:27:44,186 --> 01:27:46,828
I'm going to get going, James.

1831
01:27:46,932 --> 01:27:48,773
Thanks for everything.

1832
01:27:48,879 --> 01:27:51,173
No!

1833
01:27:51,276 --> 01:27:52,771
You're not going anywhere!

1834
01:27:52,876 --> 01:27:55,307
You're not going anywhere.

1835
01:27:55,412 --> 01:27:58,193
And don't even think of trying anything.

1836
01:27:58,297 --> 01:27:59,444
It didn't work for Angel.

1837
01:28:13,868 --> 01:28:15,120
You know Gabriel, Mia?

1838
01:28:18,665 --> 01:28:22,662
He was one of the seven archangels.

1839
01:28:22,766 --> 01:28:24,365
God's hero.

1840
01:28:24,469 --> 01:28:27,076
The Angel of Judgment.

1841
01:28:27,180 --> 01:28:31,004
You were sent to me as a sign.

1842
01:28:31,108 --> 01:28:33,158
I thought you were different.

1843
01:28:33,263 --> 01:28:34,792
But you failed.

1844
01:28:34,897 --> 01:28:38,059
Just like angel before you.

1845
01:28:38,162 --> 01:28:41,256
Another false prophet.

1846
01:28:41,361 --> 01:28:43,550
Now we're going to finish where you left off.

1847
01:28:47,861 --> 01:28:49,355
SIMONE: What do you think you're doing?

1848
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:50,363
ABBY: Where is he?

1849
01:28:50,467 --> 01:28:52,761
In his office?

1850
01:28:52,866 --> 01:28:55,751
Where is my daughter? MALCOLM: I don't know.

1851
01:28:55,855 --> 01:28:57,453
I didn't put a microchip in her.

1852
01:28:57,558 --> 01:28:59,191
Answer me!

1853
01:28:59,295 --> 01:29:01,207
Calm down.

1854
01:29:01,312 --> 01:29:02,007
She left.

1855
01:29:02,111 --> 01:29:03,640
About an hour ago.

1856
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:04,718
Well what was she doing here?

1857
01:29:04,823 --> 01:29:05,970
What-- what have you done to her?

1858
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:07,324
OK, you know what?

1859
01:29:07,428 --> 01:29:09,827
Your daughter came to me and tried to bribe

1860
01:29:09,932 --> 01:29:11,182
me into taking down her site.

1861
01:29:11,287 --> 01:29:14,693
I said no and I sent her on her way.

1862
01:29:14,798 --> 01:29:16,570
Well, Malcolm, I can't find her anywhere,

1863
01:29:16,675 --> 01:29:21,331
so would you please, just please help me.

1864
01:29:21,436 --> 01:29:23,243
Not my concern.

1865
01:29:23,347 --> 01:29:24,181
Let's go.

1866
01:29:26,475 --> 01:29:27,310
Out.

1867
01:29:30,542 --> 01:29:32,906
Out!

1868
01:29:33,010 --> 01:29:34,748
Abby!

1869
01:29:34,852 --> 01:29:38,015
If I was Mia, I would go to the police or Web Watch.

1870
01:29:38,119 --> 01:29:42,082
I don't hear any sirens, so it's probably door number two.

1871
01:29:42,186 --> 01:29:43,645
Simone, thank you!

1872
01:29:49,972 --> 01:29:51,431
JAMES: The lipstick behind you.

1873
01:29:51,535 --> 01:29:52,404
Pick it up.

1874
01:29:55,428 --> 01:29:56,958
Spread it on your lips.

1875
01:30:02,658 --> 01:30:05,472
Now walk up to the camera and kiss

1876
01:30:05,578 --> 01:30:09,574
it, just like you did that first night.

1877
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:10,617
No.

1878
01:30:10,721 --> 01:30:11,799
Do it!

1879
01:30:18,681 --> 01:30:19,584
That's a good girl.

1880
01:30:22,643 --> 01:30:25,840
Just lean in and kiss it.

1881
01:30:31,227 --> 01:30:32,061
Dammit.

1882
01:30:43,670 --> 01:30:44,540
Oh!

1883
01:31:23,189 --> 01:31:24,023
ABBY: Mia!

1884
01:31:28,716 --> 01:31:29,655
Can you breathe?

1885
01:31:29,759 --> 01:31:30,698
Mia!

1886
01:31:30,802 --> 01:31:31,740
Oh god!

1887
01:31:31,845 --> 01:31:33,199
Just breathe!

1888
01:31:33,303 --> 01:31:34,416
Oh, sweetie!

1889
01:31:37,649 --> 01:31:39,630
Argh!

1890
01:31:39,734 --> 01:31:41,089
Oh, Mia!

1891
01:31:41,193 --> 01:31:42,723
What happened to me?

1892
01:31:52,002 --> 01:31:53,115
Oh, Justin!

1893
01:32:22,763 --> 01:32:25,195
It's OK.

1894
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:27,490
POLICEMAN: Your attacker's in custody.

1895
01:32:27,594 --> 01:32:28,949
There will be a trial, of course,

1896
01:32:29,053 --> 01:32:31,000
and you'll have to testify, but we got a strong case

1897
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:32,217
against him, not to worry.

1898
01:32:32,321 --> 01:32:33,642
ABBY: What about Malcolm Lowe?

1899
01:32:33,747 --> 01:32:35,449
POLICEMAN: He was arrested, his computer seized,

1900
01:32:35,554 --> 01:32:37,951
and his business temporarily shut down.

1901
01:32:38,055 --> 01:32:40,037
Simone has agreed to testify against him.

1902
01:32:40,141 --> 01:32:41,532
Say what she saw that night.

1903
01:32:41,636 --> 01:32:43,548
So we'll at least get one count of child pornography

1904
01:32:43,652 --> 01:32:46,780
against him and against all the men who watched.

1905
01:32:46,884 --> 01:32:48,934
Well, this all sounds good.

1906
01:32:49,039 --> 01:32:50,394
It's really good.

1907
01:32:50,499 --> 01:32:52,201
And hopefully we'll be able to shut down Mr. Lowe's

1908
01:32:52,306 --> 01:32:53,592
website once and for all.

1909
01:32:53,697 --> 01:32:55,017
Thank you, officer.

1910
01:32:55,121 --> 01:32:56,025
Thank you.

1911
01:32:56,129 --> 01:32:56,964
Bye.

1912
01:33:04,263 --> 01:33:06,661
CUSTOMER: An apple pie and a diet soda.

1913
01:33:06,765 --> 01:33:08,051
No, no.

1914
01:33:08,155 --> 01:33:09,372
An iced tea.

1915
01:33:09,477 --> 01:33:11,144
Diet.

1916
01:33:11,248 --> 01:33:16,184
OK, that'll be $15.45. There you go.

1917
01:33:16,288 --> 01:33:17,158
Thanks.

1918
01:33:20,494 --> 01:33:22,788
Hi, can I help you?

1919
01:33:22,892 --> 01:33:26,577
Yes, I'd like a veggie burger, uh, hold the hairnet.

1920
01:33:26,681 --> 01:33:30,399
And a double burger combo with the extra hairnet on the side

1921
01:33:30,504 --> 01:33:31,791
please.

1922
01:33:31,894 --> 01:33:34,675
You're both going to get extra spit if you don't shut up.

1923
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:37,316
I have a hairnet!

1924
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:39,820
I'm starting to think flipping burgers is so not worth it.

1925
01:33:42,495 --> 01:33:44,059
Well it's better than the alternative.

1926
01:33:44,164 --> 01:33:45,971
I know.

1927
01:33:46,075 --> 01:33:47,222
OK?

1928
01:33:47,327 --> 01:33:48,508
Mia?

1929
01:33:48,612 --> 01:33:50,420
Am I paying you to chat with your friends?

1930
01:33:50,525 --> 01:33:52,992
I don't think so.

1931
01:33:53,096 --> 01:33:53,930
Well, I better go.

1932
01:33:54,035 --> 01:33:55,251
I've got a cow to fry.

1933
01:33:55,356 --> 01:33:56,329
Sure.

1934
01:33:56,433 --> 01:33:57,301
Um--

1935
01:34:00,743 --> 01:34:03,732
Oh, uh, don't mind me, I'll just be over there

1936
01:34:03,835 --> 01:34:04,705
rearranging the straws.

1937
01:34:11,239 --> 01:34:13,116
Do you want a donair?

1938
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:16,523
You saved my life, I don't mind getting it for you.

1939
01:34:16,627 --> 01:34:17,739
You softened him up.

1940
01:34:17,843 --> 01:34:19,128
He was half over when I got there.

1941
01:34:30,007 --> 01:34:31,363
CHELSEA: OK, I'm this close to hurling,

1942
01:34:31,468 --> 01:34:33,623
so before you're fired, we'd better go.

1943
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:36,994
What?

1944
01:34:37,098 --> 01:34:37,967
That's wrong?

1945
01:34:38,071 --> 01:34:39,288
[laughs]

1946
01:34:39,392 --> 01:34:40,748
I'll see you tonight.

1947
01:34:40,852 --> 01:34:42,138
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

1948
01:34:42,242 --> 01:34:43,111
Bye.

1949
01:34:43,216 --> 01:34:44,049
Bye!

1950
01:35:00,316 --> 01:35:03,826
