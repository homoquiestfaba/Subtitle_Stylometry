1
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,078
Hitler goes to
a fortuneteller and asks:

2
00:00:43,412 --> 00:00:45,162
"When will I die?"

3
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,665
And the fortuneteller replies:

4
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:50,126
"On a Jewish holiday. "

5
00:00:51,043 --> 00:00:54,337
Hitler then asks,
"How do you know that?"

6
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:56,006
And she replies:

7
00:00:56,255 --> 00:00:59,428
"Any day you die
will be a Jewish holiday. "

8
00:01:01,804 --> 00:01:03,680
So you ask me, as a Jew:

9
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,434
"How could you tell a joke like that
at a time like that?"

10
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:11,228
That's how we survived.

11
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:14,065
Those were some of the things
that kept us going.

12
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,153
Everything else,
the Germans had taken.

13
00:01:17,403 --> 00:01:22,032
They built high walls with
barbed wire to shut us in the ghetto.

14
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:26,577
We were isolated from the rest
of the world for years without news.

15
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:30,789
So we relied on the little things:

16
00:01:31,915 --> 00:01:33,333
A dark joke.

17
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:34,961
A sunny day.

18
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:37,088
A hopeful rumour.

19
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,924
That's why we'd go
and sit by the ghetto wall...

20
00:01:41,175 --> 00:01:44,052
...and look at the tree
where I first kissed Hannah.

21
00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:49,223
And it was by that wall
that it all started.

22
00:01:56,064 --> 00:01:59,023
With a single sheet of newspaper.

23
00:04:13,402 --> 00:04:15,861
No! It's too dangerous!

24
00:04:16,321 --> 00:04:17,696
Where can she go?

25
00:04:29,248 --> 00:04:30,875
Run, liebele. Run!

26
00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:33,418
Be safe. Go, go, go!

27
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:43,513
DarIing!

28
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:47,307
We'II see you soon!
We Iove you, Lina!

29
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:26,220
HaIt!

30
00:05:28,471 --> 00:05:31,850
What are you doing there?
Trying to escape from the ghetto?

31
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:33,643
Name!

32
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:35,645
Jakob Heym.

33
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:39,231
Don't you know it's punishabIe
by death for a Jew...

34
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:41,274
...to be in the streets after curfew?

35
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:43,611
You're right.
Of course you're right.

36
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:45,569
One hundred percent correct.

37
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:47,989
I don't think
the siren went off yet.

38
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:51,119
A smart Jew! Go over there!

39
00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:54,163
Present yourseIf
to the officer on duty...

40
00:05:54,413 --> 00:05:56,914
...and teII him
you were out after 8!

41
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,376
But it's not 8.

42
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:00,709
Are you arguing?

43
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:02,503
Go!

44
00:06:35,243 --> 00:06:38,497
This is the radio of
the German Armed Forces Network.

45
00:06:38,747 --> 00:06:40,206
HeiI, HitIer!

46
00:06:50,382 --> 00:06:52,509
We will now broadcast
a special bulletin.

47
00:06:55,094 --> 00:06:57,471
During a hard-fought
defensive battle...

48
00:06:57,721 --> 00:07:02,141
...heroic troops of the Fatherland,
under General von Hartung...

49
00:07:02,392 --> 00:07:06,272
...succeeded in driving back
the Russian forces near Bezanika.

50
00:07:07,356 --> 00:07:11,235
Bezanika is a very strategic point
of this sector.

51
00:07:11,485 --> 00:07:14,445
We will now broadcast a message
from our Führer.

52
00:07:15,781 --> 00:07:16,948
Bezanika.

53
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:21,077
The Russians are there,
onIy 400 kiIometres away.

54
00:07:21,327 --> 00:07:24,206
My God!
They're in PoIand.

55
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,140
What are you doing here?

56
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:46,685
The sentry sent me to Your RoyaIness
for my proper punishment.

57
00:07:46,936 --> 00:07:50,773
AIthough I hadn't heard the siren,
and with due respect...

58
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:53,775
...if his watch is right,
then your cIock is wrong.

59
00:07:54,192 --> 00:07:56,652
But that is for you to decide.

60
00:07:56,902 --> 00:07:58,029
Decide?

61
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,531
What?

62
00:08:00,323 --> 00:08:02,365
My appropriate punishment.

63
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:05,952
Even though, I take the Iiberty
of repeating myseIf:

64
00:08:06,244 --> 00:08:08,079
00.

65
00:08:08,872 --> 00:08:12,875
00.
It's onIy three minutes to 8.

66
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:16,295
Two minutes to 8.

67
00:08:19,049 --> 00:08:23,053
Then the gentIeman, the sentry,
was just making fun of me.

68
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,513
Just because there's a war...

69
00:08:25,763 --> 00:08:28,307
...peopIe shouIdn't stop joking
with one another.

70
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:29,724
May I?

71
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:35,565
We Jews are partiaI to jokes too.

72
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,913
Do you Iive far from here?

73
00:08:51,204 --> 00:08:53,416
Ten minutes, if I run.

74
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:56,961
Then hurry.

75
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:08,345
PIease may I have a pass?

76
00:09:25,902 --> 00:09:28,905
Now what do I do, Hannah?
I'm Iocked outside.

77
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:32,201
Gotta keep going.

78
00:09:33,953 --> 00:09:35,412
It's crazy, Hannah.

79
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:37,915
I may be the onIy Jew
for 400 kiIometres...

80
00:09:38,207 --> 00:09:40,375
...trying to get
back into the ghetto.

81
00:09:47,715 --> 00:09:51,428
To get across that distance,
you have to be a mouse.

82
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,139
Oh, God of the Jews!

83
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,641
Why didn't you make your peopIe
a race of mice?

84
00:09:57,058 --> 00:10:00,312
What good does it do to be a man?

85
00:10:02,229 --> 00:10:03,565
I'm going.

86
00:10:03,773 --> 00:10:04,606
I go.

87
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,320
Not yet!

88
00:10:09,487 --> 00:10:11,282
Wait for the searchIight to go by.

89
00:10:11,532 --> 00:10:13,574
-Who are you?
-Lina Kronstein.

90
00:10:13,824 --> 00:10:16,243
I'm 10 1I2. How oId are you?

91
00:10:16,827 --> 00:10:18,078
Watch out!

92
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:24,626
What are you doing here, anyway?
Trying to escape?

93
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:28,046
Where? A Jew wouId not Iast
five minutes out there.

94
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:29,922
So you're going back in?

95
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:30,964
Yes.

96
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,091
May I come with you?

97
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:34,635
With me?

98
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:36,969
Why me?

99
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:38,930
Who eIse?

100
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,431
AII right.

101
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,811
Come on.

102
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,397
Oh, wait! Wait!

103
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:48,522
You're scared?

104
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,651
No. Terrified.

105
00:11:14,297 --> 00:11:16,132
Come on! This way!

106
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,139
-Here.
-Thank you, IittIe mouse.

107
00:11:33,358 --> 00:11:34,483
Hide! PoIice!

108
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:35,651
Here!

109
00:12:01,883 --> 00:12:03,510
Bye-bye, IittIe girI.

110
00:12:04,345 --> 00:12:06,137
Thanks for saving my Iife.

111
00:12:06,846 --> 00:12:08,557
You'II have to excuse me.

112
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:12,476
I'm very tired. I'm going home.
You shouId do the same.

113
00:12:15,105 --> 00:12:17,107
Maybe I'II take the tram.

114
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:19,484
Bye-bye.

115
00:12:22,237 --> 00:12:23,528
AII right.

116
00:12:24,196 --> 00:12:27,449
Where wouId you Iike to go?
Do you have money for your fare?

117
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,493
Come on.

118
00:12:29,744 --> 00:12:32,078
You can't stay here.
You have to go home.

119
00:12:32,915 --> 00:12:34,624
Where are your parents?

120
00:12:55,726 --> 00:12:56,559
Come on!

121
00:13:08,237 --> 00:13:12,283
Our apartment is much nicer.
We have a Iiving room.

122
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:16,329
WeII, when there were
10 peopIe crammed in here...

123
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:18,748
...I'II show you no Iiving room.

124
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,166
If you don't Iike it,
find another hoteI.

125
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,418
That's not a nice thing
to say to me.

126
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:24,878
Excuse me.

127
00:13:25,128 --> 00:13:26,672
-Where do I sIeep?
-Upstairs.

128
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:27,840
Why not here?

129
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:31,302
Because some nosy neighbour
might see you and denounce me...

130
00:13:31,552 --> 00:13:33,845
...and then the Germans wiII come.
Come on.

131
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:39,142
-Here, kitty, kitty.
-Leave the cat aIone.

132
00:13:40,851 --> 00:13:43,687
-Don't you Iike cats?
-No. I prefer a rat.

133
00:13:44,521 --> 00:13:47,235
I don't want to see you
pIaying with that cat.

134
00:13:48,735 --> 00:13:51,612
I certainIy don't want to see you
catch it and eat it.

135
00:13:51,862 --> 00:13:55,199
Any cat that Iets itseIf
get caught is sick.

136
00:13:55,616 --> 00:13:58,369
AII right, but
what am I supposed to eat?

137
00:13:58,744 --> 00:14:01,414
You don't have
any ration coupons for me.

138
00:14:01,914 --> 00:14:03,206
That's true.

139
00:14:03,915 --> 00:14:06,209
I'II burn that bridge
when I get to it.

140
00:14:10,546 --> 00:14:11,714
Here we are.

141
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:14,049
Look.

142
00:14:18,052 --> 00:14:20,054
There's heat from the chimney.

143
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:25,895
Here's a book about Africa. You read
this, you'II forget you're hungry.

144
00:14:26,186 --> 00:14:27,729
Don't worry. I'm used to it.

145
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,524
Now, come on.

146
00:14:33,818 --> 00:14:36,153
-What's wrong?
-I Iost my doII.

147
00:14:37,822 --> 00:14:39,531
Sorry, I don't have any doIIs.

148
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:40,993
Why not?

149
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:44,830
WeII, me and my wife
didn't have any chiIdren.

150
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:48,125
Where is your wife?
Did they put her on a train?

151
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:50,000
No, they shot her!

152
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,004
Under a tree.

153
00:14:53,587 --> 00:14:56,632
Don't ask me what kind of tree.
I didn't bother to ask.

154
00:14:57,506 --> 00:14:58,843
Time for sIeep.

155
00:15:01,471 --> 00:15:02,889
It's crazy, Hannah.

156
00:15:04,682 --> 00:15:08,477
I manage to more or Iess
smuggIe myseIf through the war.

157
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:11,479
I even got out
of the Kommandantur aIive.

158
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,524
And now I'm supposed
to take care of a IittIe girI.

159
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:21,821
I know we wanted a chiId.

160
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,116
But you usuaIIy
have them as babies...

161
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:27,369
...and you get
a chance to know them.

162
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:30,453
That's true.

163
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:35,294
But what if the Germans find her?
I'm the one who'II have to pay.

164
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:39,714
If the Russians are that cIose...

165
00:15:40,548 --> 00:15:42,717
...it's onIy a few days, right?

166
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,519
Bezanika

167
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:56,772
Germans are dying each day

168
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:19,752
Russians are on their way

169
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:25,758
-KowaIsky!
-We're cIosed. We're cIosed.

170
00:16:26,008 --> 00:16:29,010
-Time to open!
-Leave me aIone. Go away!

171
00:16:31,054 --> 00:16:32,430
What are you doing?

172
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,557
-You can't kiII yourseIf.
-You got a reason why not?

173
00:16:35,807 --> 00:16:37,267
Yeah, I have a good one.

174
00:16:38,102 --> 00:16:39,769
That's just between you and me.

175
00:16:40,896 --> 00:16:44,189
Yesterday evening
something very funny happened.

176
00:16:44,773 --> 00:16:48,279
ActuaIIy, not that funny.
You might not find it funny.

177
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:51,406
-It's where I caught this coId--
-Get to the point.

178
00:16:51,656 --> 00:16:56,411
The point is, my friend, yesterday after
curfew, I was in the Kommandantur--

179
00:16:56,703 --> 00:16:58,954
-Are you an informer?
-Are you out of your mind?

180
00:16:59,163 --> 00:17:02,333
No Jew Ieaves the Kommandantur
aIive except informers.

181
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,044
Don't teII me Iies.
I'm desperate, not stupid.

182
00:17:05,294 --> 00:17:08,298
Get out of here, pIease.
PIease Ieave me aIone.

183
00:17:08,548 --> 00:17:09,716
Go ahead.

184
00:17:09,966 --> 00:17:13,720
PeopIe wiII say KowaIsky
didn't keep his part of a bargain.

185
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:17,097
I'm entitIed to
daiIy shaves and haircuts.

186
00:17:17,348 --> 00:17:21,060
In exchange, you can eat
aII the pancakes you want in my café.

187
00:17:21,477 --> 00:17:23,143
You haven't made any for 3 years.

188
00:17:23,435 --> 00:17:26,274
What can I do?
The Germans don't Iet potatoes in.

189
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:27,900
But your beard keeps growing.

190
00:17:28,151 --> 00:17:31,110
That's not my fauIt.
A deaI's a deaI.

191
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,323
Oh, good.

192
00:17:35,782 --> 00:17:38,618
What are you compIaining about?
You have a duII razor.

193
00:17:38,868 --> 00:17:39,827
Sit down.

194
00:17:40,328 --> 00:17:42,371
Barber with a duII razor
is Iike a bIind moyl.

195
00:17:42,621 --> 00:17:45,666
No insuIts. Sit down, pIease.
Here we go.

196
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,628
Here. Enough.

197
00:17:52,421 --> 00:17:53,839
Good. Enough!

198
00:18:01,974 --> 00:18:03,016
Professor!

199
00:18:03,808 --> 00:18:04,725
No, thank you.

200
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:21,575
Excuse me.
My respects, professor.

201
00:18:21,825 --> 00:18:24,870
I caught a coId Iast night.
Do you have some medicaI advice?

202
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,831
A cigar
and brandy, taken in Monte CarIo.

203
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:30,875
Give me your hand, professor.

204
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,629
-You have a good night?
-Good night?

205
00:18:36,921 --> 00:18:40,594
If three suicides baIanced by
one birth is a good night, then, yes.

206
00:18:40,844 --> 00:18:42,889
SpIendid, wonderfuI night.

207
00:18:52,854 --> 00:18:56,524
Line up two at a time!
Pick a partner!

208
00:19:12,704 --> 00:19:15,960
-HerscheI, you need a partner?
-Yes, but not with cough.

209
00:19:18,253 --> 00:19:19,171
Professor!

210
00:19:19,421 --> 00:19:21,924
Two weak men
don't make a strong man.

211
00:19:27,636 --> 00:19:29,055
You forgot me!

212
00:19:29,305 --> 00:19:31,223
-I unIoad, you carry.
-What'II I get?

213
00:19:31,556 --> 00:19:32,767
The pIeasure of my company.

214
00:19:38,981 --> 00:19:40,191
I have to eat.

215
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:42,275
Do I have to feed you?

216
00:19:48,658 --> 00:19:50,324
AII right.

217
00:20:25,815 --> 00:20:27,149
You aII right?

218
00:20:27,484 --> 00:20:28,571
Yes, thank you.

219
00:20:36,286 --> 00:20:37,286
Mischa?

220
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:41,539
Where are you? Sneaking a cigarette?
Is that it?

221
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:46,378
Oh, my God!

222
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,715
Are you meshugge?
It's forbidden to do that!

223
00:20:49,965 --> 00:20:53,927
It couId be you and me here one day.
ShouIdn't we do something?

224
00:20:54,176 --> 00:20:58,222
The best thing to do is nothing!
I don't want to be shot!

225
00:20:58,848 --> 00:21:00,808
What way wouId you prefer to die?

226
00:21:01,058 --> 00:21:02,474
Go away.
Don't stand here.

227
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:06,397
I can't Iet you do something stupid!

228
00:21:06,648 --> 00:21:07,733
Can you stop me?

229
00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:09,650
I'm your manager.

230
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:12,069
You're not a very good one.

231
00:21:12,361 --> 00:21:14,070
You're not a very good boxer.

232
00:21:16,532 --> 00:21:19,576
-You want to try me?
-We're not the same weight cIass!

233
00:21:20,868 --> 00:21:21,911
Guard!

234
00:21:27,374 --> 00:21:28,958
The guard is coming.

235
00:21:32,253 --> 00:21:34,173
You'II make a good-Iooking corpse.

236
00:21:34,589 --> 00:21:36,506
I'II take one of those
bastards with me.

237
00:21:36,715 --> 00:21:37,549
Don't!

238
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:40,093
The Russians are in Bezanika.

239
00:21:40,344 --> 00:21:43,389
And I heard HitIer's appIying
to be chief rabbi in BerIin.

240
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,099
-It's the truth.
-Let go!

241
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,393
I heard it on the radio!

242
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,189
It's forbidden to taIk.
Go to work.

243
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:07,955
What are you Iaughing at?

244
00:22:08,872 --> 00:22:10,415
Forgive me, but...

245
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,333
...I just heard good news.

246
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,628
Go, go!

247
00:22:18,925 --> 00:22:20,425
You'II get shot.

248
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,638
-You have a radio?
-Who said that?

249
00:22:24,888 --> 00:22:26,722
-You said that.
-No, I didn't.

250
00:22:26,973 --> 00:22:29,101
-What have we been taIking about?
-Shut up!

251
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:41,902
You sneaky bastard!

252
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,947
You had a radio aII this time!
I can't beIieve it!

253
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,658
I have no radio. I just said that
to keep you from getting shot.

254
00:22:48,908 --> 00:22:50,660
Nobody'd say that if he didn't.

255
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,957
Do you reaIize the penaIty
for having a radio is death?

256
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:56,250
I was Iying!

257
00:23:06,175 --> 00:23:07,259
Lying?

258
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,054
If you had one and didn't
want anyone to know...

259
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:13,183
...the best way wouId be
to say you had one...

260
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:16,937
...because no one owning a radio
wouId be stupid enough to admit it.

261
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,648
They'd Ieave you aIone,
which means...

262
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,024
-What does it mean, Jakob?
-I don't know.

263
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,110
It means you've got a radio.

264
00:23:25,652 --> 00:23:28,156
I don't have a radio.

265
00:23:29,989 --> 00:23:31,202
I understand.

266
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,369
Go, go.

267
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,460
Don't worry, Jakob.
You can trust me.

268
00:23:41,752 --> 00:23:43,337
I'II keep it under my hat.

269
00:23:45,004 --> 00:23:45,838
You better.

270
00:23:46,088 --> 00:23:47,298
Because if you don't...

271
00:23:47,548 --> 00:23:50,968
...you better start the Kaddish now,
because I'm a dead man.

272
00:23:55,263 --> 00:23:56,223
-Jakob!
-What?

273
00:23:56,514 --> 00:23:58,308
I'm going to start training again.

274
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:00,310
TeII your new manager.

275
00:24:00,727 --> 00:24:03,270
HeIIo, Anna! How are you?

276
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,865
Are you taking a trip somewhere?

277
00:24:14,115 --> 00:24:16,909
I think it's too dangerous
for you if I stay...

278
00:24:17,158 --> 00:24:19,786
...so I shouId go
with my parents after aII.

279
00:24:20,078 --> 00:24:21,539
May I take your book?

280
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,669
You're not going anywhere
untiI you eat your supper.

281
00:24:30,173 --> 00:24:31,215
Aren't you eating?

282
00:24:31,465 --> 00:24:35,885
Eat, aIways eat. It's not good
to stuff yourseIf tiII bursting.

283
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:42,808
Mischa. Have you been
in another fight?

284
00:24:43,058 --> 00:24:45,229
No, it's nothing.
I have very good news.

285
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:47,439
Good news? What good news?

286
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,524
HeIIo, Mrs. Frankfurter.

287
00:24:50,692 --> 00:24:51,526
HeIIo, Mr.--

288
00:24:53,403 --> 00:24:54,863
How are you today?

289
00:24:56,614 --> 00:24:58,866
Mr. Frankfurter,
I have something to ask you.

290
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:01,910
I've aIready beaten you, Papa.

291
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,872
UntiI the Iast Iine has been spoken,
the curtain cannot come down.

292
00:25:06,122 --> 00:25:08,081
Excuse me, Mr. Frankfurter--

293
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:13,296
You have something to ask me?

294
00:25:13,629 --> 00:25:17,215
I'm prepared to heIp you with
the overcrowding in this apartment.

295
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:23,096
Before I forget...
For you.

296
00:25:24,098 --> 00:25:25,224
Two rutabagas.

297
00:25:25,473 --> 00:25:29,102
I know it's not much. It doesn't
seem a fair exchange for...

298
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:31,645
Mr. Frankfurter.

299
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,731
Mrs. Frankfurter.

300
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:37,568
I am here to ask for
the hand of your daughter.

301
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:42,532
Come with me for a minute.

302
00:25:45,785 --> 00:25:47,161
You know where we are?

303
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:50,915
Trains are coming to take us
and you make matrimoniaI pIans?

304
00:25:51,207 --> 00:25:55,335
We've Iearned to Iive without
firewood, potatoes, decent cIothing...

305
00:25:55,585 --> 00:25:58,672
...without chiIdren, but no one
can Iive without a future.

306
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:01,801
We have a future.
The war's about to end.

307
00:26:02,092 --> 00:26:03,844
Someday, but who'II see it?

308
00:26:04,094 --> 00:26:04,929
We wiII!

309
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:07,848
Our war is nearIy over.
You can count the hours.

310
00:26:08,098 --> 00:26:09,390
Don't do this to my famiIy!

311
00:26:09,641 --> 00:26:13,018
Don't come here and fiII our heads
with faIse hope!

312
00:26:18,273 --> 00:26:20,234
Do you know where Bezanika is?

313
00:26:20,483 --> 00:26:22,068
Do I know where Bezanika is?

314
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,863
I pIayed King Lear there three times.
"As fIies to... "

315
00:26:26,113 --> 00:26:27,240
"To wanton--"

316
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:31,202
"As fIies to wanton boys are we
to the gods. They kiII us for sport."

317
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:33,872
Bezanika's Iess than
400 kiIometres away.

318
00:26:34,123 --> 00:26:35,456
So what do I care?

319
00:26:35,706 --> 00:26:39,210
The Red Army is there tonight.
ProbabIy even cIoser by now.

320
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,712
StaIin toId you this news personaIIy?

321
00:26:44,965 --> 00:26:48,593
In absoIute confidence,
just between you and me...

322
00:26:50,554 --> 00:26:52,765
...and Rosa and Mrs. Frankfurter...

323
00:26:53,515 --> 00:26:56,227
...and Avron and Judith, and...

324
00:27:04,025 --> 00:27:05,192
Jakob Heym toId me.

325
00:27:06,111 --> 00:27:08,486
Jakob Heym, the iIIustrious
pancake vendor.

326
00:27:08,736 --> 00:27:10,491
If he said it, it must be true.

327
00:27:11,783 --> 00:27:13,452
He's got a radio.

328
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:26,880
PIease, don't teII anyone.
It couId be dangerous for him.

329
00:27:36,806 --> 00:27:38,932
And you never said anything about it.

330
00:27:39,183 --> 00:27:41,434
You've been Iistening to a radio!

331
00:27:41,684 --> 00:27:43,269
Don't worry, it has no pIug.

332
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:45,438
Now I'II reduce it to spIinters.

333
00:27:45,688 --> 00:27:46,524
CIose the door.

334
00:27:54,031 --> 00:27:55,990
We couIdn't Iisten to it
for a moment?

335
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:57,366
Excuse me.

336
00:27:57,617 --> 00:28:01,787
What happens when the Gestapo finds
the pancake vendor has a radio?

337
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:06,459
They wiII search the ghetto.
What wiII they find? This radio.

338
00:28:06,709 --> 00:28:10,213
I'II say that I never Iistened to it.
They'II shoot me anyway.

339
00:28:10,504 --> 00:28:14,466
For an encore, they'II hang me in
the square, next to that idiot Heym!

340
00:28:16,511 --> 00:28:17,636
Morning!

341
00:28:29,022 --> 00:28:32,400
-Great morning, Jakob.
-Good to see you, good to see you.

342
00:29:06,223 --> 00:29:07,517
So what's new?

343
00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:11,520
Nothing much, you know.
Kvart's wife Ieft him.

344
00:29:13,104 --> 00:29:15,607
Under the circumstances,
seems a bit pointIess.

345
00:29:15,857 --> 00:29:17,066
That's too bad.

346
00:29:17,316 --> 00:29:20,028
You know, women.
Since Adam.

347
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,572
You don't say.

348
00:29:22,866 --> 00:29:24,658
Can you keep my hair from faIIing out?

349
00:29:24,908 --> 00:29:26,826
How Iong have we been friends?

350
00:29:27,243 --> 00:29:29,453
What does that have to do
with my hair?

351
00:29:29,746 --> 00:29:31,372
Do you have that green stuff?

352
00:29:31,622 --> 00:29:36,086
You come every day for a free shave
and never mentioned a radio.

353
00:29:36,336 --> 00:29:38,630
What radio? I have radios
Iike I have potatoes.

354
00:29:38,881 --> 00:29:43,050
-Everybody knows you got a radio.
-What do you mean, everybody knows?

355
00:29:43,301 --> 00:29:46,888
It's traveIIing at Ieast as fast
as the news about Kvart's wife.

356
00:29:47,138 --> 00:29:49,807
ReaIIy? So by the evening,
the Gestapo wiII know.

357
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:54,227
You stiII have that rope?
I may need it.

358
00:29:54,477 --> 00:29:56,770
Mischa says the Russians kiIIed
so many Germans...

359
00:29:57,022 --> 00:29:59,398
...their tanks crossed the river
on their bodies.

360
00:29:59,647 --> 00:30:02,610
-Did Mischa say that?
-Yes, he did. Is this true?

361
00:30:02,943 --> 00:30:04,194
Is it?

362
00:30:28,343 --> 00:30:32,139
I want you to be the first to know
I'm engaged to Rosa.

363
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:33,556
-Mazel tov!
-Thank you.

364
00:30:33,806 --> 00:30:35,642
But what about our news?

365
00:30:35,892 --> 00:30:38,520
I onIy toId famiIy and friends
and Frankfurter.

366
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:41,438
Schmuck! You toId a barber!

367
00:30:41,855 --> 00:30:44,274
A barber.
The biggest mouth in town.

368
00:30:45,651 --> 00:30:47,192
Murderer.

369
00:30:47,985 --> 00:30:50,906
I'm sorry, Jakob.
You want a partner?

370
00:30:52,659 --> 00:30:53,952
Jakob, you need a partner?

371
00:30:54,576 --> 00:30:56,161
You need a partner, Jakob?

372
00:30:58,788 --> 00:30:59,998
He is my partner!

373
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:02,542
No! I work with SamueI.

374
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:04,919
I'm your partner, Jakob. Me.

375
00:31:13,676 --> 00:31:16,512
Stop. I know bubkes.

376
00:31:30,985 --> 00:31:32,695
How many kiIometres
did they make today?

377
00:31:32,945 --> 00:31:34,489
Get off my back.

378
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:40,201
Excuse me. Your friend Jakob,
did he teII you about the front Iine?

379
00:31:41,327 --> 00:31:43,121
WeII, he asked me not to say.

380
00:31:43,371 --> 00:31:44,331
What?

381
00:31:47,334 --> 00:31:49,377
Can he get the BBC?

382
00:31:49,627 --> 00:31:51,921
BBC? Of course.

383
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,507
-PIease give me something.
-Go away.

384
00:31:54,757 --> 00:31:57,467
Don't teII me you haven't Iistened
since yesterday.

385
00:31:58,887 --> 00:32:02,224
Yesterday, there was
a program of dance music.

386
00:32:02,474 --> 00:32:06,103
Maybe after work,
I couId teach you the tango.

387
00:32:07,396 --> 00:32:08,353
Shit!

388
00:32:13,192 --> 00:32:14,152
Listen.

389
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:18,988
There was a program
of music yesterday.

390
00:32:19,488 --> 00:32:21,032
Russian music.

391
00:32:21,283 --> 00:32:24,076
I'm teIIing you,
we'II never see the Russians.

392
00:32:32,042 --> 00:32:35,503
We'II never see the Russians, eh?
So what are those?

393
00:33:00,194 --> 00:33:02,780
Mr. Frankfurter, the Russians...

394
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:05,115
...they're going to bomb us.

395
00:33:05,658 --> 00:33:06,866
This is the good news?

396
00:33:15,543 --> 00:33:16,753
Germans.

397
00:33:17,878 --> 00:33:19,713
They Iook Iike Germans to me.

398
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:23,508
Your information said they were
retreating under Russian attack.

399
00:33:27,095 --> 00:33:29,888
They're fIying east and...

400
00:33:33,684 --> 00:33:35,102
Use your brains a IittIe.

401
00:33:35,351 --> 00:33:39,104
If the Germans are headed in that
direction, towards Bezanika...

402
00:33:39,355 --> 00:33:42,149
...and the Russians are
headed there aIso, they say.

403
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,609
There, exactIy.

404
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,320
If the Russians are there, they're
not going to sit and have a picnic.

405
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:48,864
I don't think so.

406
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,035
-For this bread, three rutabagas.
-Two turnips!

407
00:33:54,286 --> 00:33:56,622
No. For two turnips,
haIf a bread.

408
00:33:56,873 --> 00:33:58,916
Three-quarters, because it's you.

409
00:33:59,584 --> 00:34:00,668
Gonif.

410
00:34:15,682 --> 00:34:17,809
Stay away from the train.

411
00:34:37,286 --> 00:34:39,455
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot, pIease!

412
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:46,544
Roman, I heard voices coming
from those boxcars.

413
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:49,296
Are you crazy? Come on, come on.

414
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,548
The show is over!

415
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,216
Back to your work!

416
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:56,385
I heard voices, I teII you.

417
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,013
Pretend there are
just potatoes in there.

418
00:34:59,262 --> 00:35:02,725
Oh, yes. It's the Iatest German
potatoes that taIk.

419
00:35:02,974 --> 00:35:05,730
It's human voices!
We've got to speak to them.

420
00:35:06,397 --> 00:35:08,064
What can you say to the dead?

421
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,942
What's the matter with you?

422
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,568
You toId us the Russians
wouId be there any moment.

423
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,695
-You want to keep that to yourseIf?
-It's none of our business.

424
00:35:15,946 --> 00:35:16,780
What's wrong with you?

425
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:17,989
Sit down.

426
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,033
They have the right to know.

427
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,288
Eat.

428
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,706
I don't wanna eat.

429
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,810
Someone heIp me, pIease!

430
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,353
Hey! Do you hear me?

431
00:35:49,396 --> 00:35:52,732
We have information.
The Russians are aImost here.

432
00:35:52,983 --> 00:35:54,108
They're at Bezanika.

433
00:35:55,276 --> 00:35:56,652
We aII saw the pIane.

434
00:35:58,194 --> 00:35:59,738
Yes, pIease beIieve me.

435
00:36:02,323 --> 00:36:03,283
You don't understand.

436
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:05,033
We have a radio!

437
00:36:14,876 --> 00:36:16,169
You want to get kiIIed too?

438
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,258
You did this!

439
00:36:19,633 --> 00:36:23,552
Did you have to shout from
the rooftops that the war is over?

440
00:36:24,678 --> 00:36:26,638
Look where it got us!

441
00:36:54,038 --> 00:36:55,751
Don't bIame yourseIf.

442
00:36:56,001 --> 00:37:00,421
If HerscheI wanted to save the worId,
that was his choice.

443
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,465
We need more Jews Iike HerscheI.

444
00:37:02,715 --> 00:37:05,300
At Ieast he tried to give
these peopIe some hope.

445
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,719
He's a hero Iike you.

446
00:37:07,511 --> 00:37:08,928
I'm not a hero.

447
00:37:09,303 --> 00:37:10,846
I'm a Iatke vendor.

448
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:13,140
A Iatke vendor with a radio.

449
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,184
Who just kiIIed a friend.

450
00:37:23,233 --> 00:37:26,276
If you hang yourseIf, I'II kiII you.

451
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:42,876
Are you going to Iisten to London?

452
00:37:43,126 --> 00:37:45,504
I can't take anymore.
You must teII me.

453
00:37:45,754 --> 00:37:46,672
The Russians--

454
00:37:46,922 --> 00:37:50,051
There are no Russians!
No radio! No nothing!

455
00:37:50,385 --> 00:37:51,885
Understand?

456
00:37:52,094 --> 00:37:52,929
What do you mean?

457
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:57,683
I mean I don't have the sIightest idea
where the Russians are.

458
00:38:00,601 --> 00:38:03,312
I'm a Iiar! AII right?

459
00:38:10,571 --> 00:38:12,072
You'II burn them. Let me do it.

460
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:14,532
I'm perfectIy capabIe
of frying mushrooms.

461
00:38:14,782 --> 00:38:17,243
I know. I ran a restaurant
before the war.

462
00:38:17,493 --> 00:38:18,327
A restaurant?

463
00:38:19,245 --> 00:38:21,080
A very quaint one.

464
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:24,749
We made Iatkes.
You know, potato pancakes.

465
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,377
And bIintzes
stuffed with apricot jam.

466
00:38:27,626 --> 00:38:30,296
And in the summer,
ice creams and fruit juices.

467
00:38:30,546 --> 00:38:31,629
Did your wife work with you?

468
00:38:32,923 --> 00:38:34,675
Why are you aIways asking questions?

469
00:38:35,175 --> 00:38:36,552
Why do you never answer them?

470
00:38:36,802 --> 00:38:37,636
I aIready ate.

471
00:38:37,845 --> 00:38:40,597
Eat. After you've eaten,
you can do the washing up.

472
00:38:40,847 --> 00:38:42,222
I hate washing up.

473
00:38:42,473 --> 00:38:44,478
I did the cooking, didn't I?

474
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:48,939
When the war is over,
can I be a waitress?

475
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,273
What about schooI?

476
00:38:50,523 --> 00:38:54,318
I'II go to schooI in the morning.
Afterwards, I'II serve customers.

477
00:38:54,943 --> 00:38:58,572
You don't have to pay me. Just Iet me
eat as many pancakes as I want.

478
00:38:58,822 --> 00:39:00,033
Just Iike KowaIsky.

479
00:39:02,702 --> 00:39:04,287
Open the window.

480
00:39:09,459 --> 00:39:11,627
Look, your friend the boxer.

481
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:15,006
Are they fighting?

482
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,800
Maybe Iater they're fighting.

483
00:39:18,175 --> 00:39:20,343
Looks Iike Mischa thinks
the war is over.

484
00:39:20,595 --> 00:39:22,931
He's trying to get her
to go to his apartment.

485
00:39:23,181 --> 00:39:24,933
Doesn't she want to go?

486
00:39:25,391 --> 00:39:27,684
-Very much.
-Then why doesn't she go?

487
00:39:27,935 --> 00:39:30,687
You'II discover these things
when you're oIder.

488
00:39:30,938 --> 00:39:31,814
When?

489
00:39:32,689 --> 00:39:34,316
No more questions.

490
00:39:42,198 --> 00:39:43,615
Spirit...

491
00:39:44,406 --> 00:39:48,035
...if the Russians have reached Pry...

492
00:39:49,662 --> 00:39:51,163
...knock twice.

493
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:55,708
Ask something usefuI, Iike where
your daughter is this time of night.

494
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:58,214
-She's with Mischa.
-That's what I'm afraid of.

495
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:01,800
He's invoIved with this troubIemaker
Heym. They'II drag Rosa into it.

496
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:05,386
On the other hand, if Rosa
doesn't sIeep home, it's better.

497
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:08,221
If they arrest us, she won't be here.

498
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,015
Some consoIation.

499
00:40:12,225 --> 00:40:15,938
The days are difficuIt. Let them do
what they want with their nights.

500
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,115
So? Did you Iisten to the radio?
Any progress at the front?

501
00:40:27,365 --> 00:40:29,993
Did the Russians
shoot down those pIanes?

502
00:40:30,243 --> 00:40:34,707
Stop torturing me. The Germans are
aIready doing a fine job.

503
00:40:45,884 --> 00:40:46,842
SamueI.

504
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:53,682
Is it suicide?

505
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:57,601
He just gave up and puIIed
the bIankets under his chin.

506
00:41:01,521 --> 00:41:06,233
Stupid thing for SamueI to do,
when the Russians are that cIose.

507
00:41:07,861 --> 00:41:09,820
Because they are, aren't they?

508
00:41:11,115 --> 00:41:12,240
Yes, professor.

509
00:41:12,491 --> 00:41:13,575
What?

510
00:41:14,576 --> 00:41:16,912
The radio says they are.

511
00:41:26,961 --> 00:41:27,922
So, Hannah...

512
00:41:28,715 --> 00:41:30,549
... the truth can kill.

513
00:41:31,301 --> 00:41:34,303
Samuel has died
because I told him the truth.

514
00:41:34,553 --> 00:41:36,680
And that crazy Herschel
died because...

515
00:41:36,931 --> 00:41:40,184
...he believed in news from a radio
that doesn't exist.

516
00:41:40,434 --> 00:41:42,560
So that's dangerous too.

517
00:41:43,938 --> 00:41:46,774
Whatever I do, I'm wrong.

518
00:41:48,776 --> 00:41:52,279
Hunger for hope may be worse
than hunger for food.

519
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,738
So what's new?

520
00:41:55,449 --> 00:41:58,117
I have to feed
them something, Hannah.

521
00:41:58,535 --> 00:41:59,619
But what?

522
00:42:11,337 --> 00:42:14,132
EIements of the 16th Army...

523
00:42:14,382 --> 00:42:17,634
...supported by fIamethrowers
of the shock troops...

524
00:42:17,925 --> 00:42:19,386
...of the Leningrad Division...

525
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,347
...are advancing with
mechanized armoured units...

526
00:42:23,684 --> 00:42:26,310
...of StaIin's Soviet 6th Brigade...

527
00:42:26,561 --> 00:42:30,439
...in an easterIy direction,
under massive air cover.

528
00:42:30,731 --> 00:42:32,024
EasterIy?

529
00:42:32,607 --> 00:42:34,025
They're headed the wrong way.

530
00:42:39,614 --> 00:42:40,614
It's just a feint...

531
00:42:40,865 --> 00:42:42,201
...to throw the Germans off.

532
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:43,410
ExactIy.

533
00:42:43,785 --> 00:42:45,830
Why wouId they announce
that on the radio?

534
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:47,497
Strategy.

535
00:42:47,747 --> 00:42:50,333
To make the Germans think
they're invading China.

536
00:42:50,584 --> 00:42:52,460
Remember, it's a worId war.

537
00:42:52,668 --> 00:42:53,503
ExactIy right.

538
00:42:54,462 --> 00:42:55,546
For exampIe...

539
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:58,214
...in Africa, there are
tribes of cannibaIs...

540
00:42:58,465 --> 00:43:00,218
...who've never seen a white man.

541
00:43:00,469 --> 00:43:01,928
We don't want news about cannibaIs.

542
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:03,180
Why not?

543
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:06,098
We want to know if the Russians
are going to get here.

544
00:43:08,392 --> 00:43:11,937
TechnicaIIy, they're retreating.
But strategicaIIy, they're advancing.

545
00:43:12,938 --> 00:43:14,189
What does that mean?

546
00:43:15,023 --> 00:43:16,649
Let me show you.

547
00:43:18,193 --> 00:43:20,695
Here is the front Iine.

548
00:43:21,738 --> 00:43:24,406
Here is Bezanika.
The Russians have that.

549
00:43:24,656 --> 00:43:26,617
Here's Pry.
The Germans have that.

550
00:43:26,867 --> 00:43:29,244
Here is the raiIroad junction
at the Rudna.

551
00:43:29,536 --> 00:43:32,162
That's what the Luftwaffe
were protecting yesterday.

552
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,706
ExactIy right!

553
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:36,461
Germans don't want
the Americans to take that.

554
00:43:37,086 --> 00:43:38,961
The Americans are in the war too?

555
00:43:39,712 --> 00:43:42,757
They didn't say they were there.
They have probIems of their own.

556
00:43:43,007 --> 00:43:46,593
They're fighting on another front.
But for now, they're sending tanks.

557
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,096
Tanks? How many?

558
00:43:50,222 --> 00:43:52,350
Not many. But enough.

559
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,353
And brand-new, right off
the boat from Chicago.

560
00:43:55,604 --> 00:43:56,854
Chicago?

561
00:43:57,522 --> 00:43:59,900
How couId you teII
they were American?

562
00:44:00,191 --> 00:44:01,651
You get to know the difference.

563
00:44:01,901 --> 00:44:04,778
American tanks,
it's a different noise entireIy.

564
00:44:05,028 --> 00:44:06,113
What kind of noise?

565
00:44:06,363 --> 00:44:07,197
CIean.

566
00:44:07,531 --> 00:44:09,157
Yeah, you can hear the horns.

567
00:44:09,407 --> 00:44:10,784
-On the tank?
-No, the band.

568
00:44:11,242 --> 00:44:14,122
They sent a jazz band
to cheer up their aIIies.

569
00:44:14,539 --> 00:44:16,124
-Saxophone?
-CIarinet.

570
00:44:16,374 --> 00:44:17,500
Sounds Iike Benny Goodman.

571
00:44:18,792 --> 00:44:19,960
-Lady singers?
-Three of them.

572
00:44:20,252 --> 00:44:21,711
-Andrew Sisters?
-Maybe their cousins.

573
00:44:21,962 --> 00:44:23,296
It sounded so beautifuI.

574
00:44:23,547 --> 00:44:26,967
And aII the time in the background,
I couId hear the Russian guns.

575
00:44:27,216 --> 00:44:30,093
It's the most beautifuI thing
I've ever heard in my Iife.

576
00:44:30,928 --> 00:44:32,221
You know, the jazz band...

577
00:44:32,471 --> 00:44:34,222
...the artiIIery, everything.

578
00:44:46,525 --> 00:44:48,734
It seems Iiberation is near.

579
00:44:49,026 --> 00:44:51,613
Heym may not be the Messiah,
but he couId be a prophet.

580
00:44:51,864 --> 00:44:53,615
Prophets speak in the name of God!

581
00:44:53,866 --> 00:44:55,784
AII the pancake vendor has
is a radio!

582
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:59,288
He's saying the same thing
Isaiah said:

583
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,498
" PeopIe of IsraeI,
I wiII Iead you out of bondage."

584
00:45:02,748 --> 00:45:03,583
"Out of bondage."

585
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:05,501
If this is what we get from Isaiah...

586
00:45:05,751 --> 00:45:08,547
...I can't wait to find out
the resuIts from the pancake vendor.

587
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:10,507
He must be stopped.

588
00:45:16,637 --> 00:45:18,306
Yeah, it is crazy.

589
00:45:18,806 --> 00:45:20,640
I know, Hannah.

590
00:45:21,893 --> 00:45:24,643
But when I started to make up
those things...

591
00:45:25,144 --> 00:45:27,191
...I aImost beIieved them.

592
00:45:31,445 --> 00:45:32,611
I know.

593
00:45:33,821 --> 00:45:38,326
The point is, what am I going
to invent tomorrow?

594
00:45:39,785 --> 00:45:44,497
In my whoIe Iife, my greatest
invention was an apricot pancake.

595
00:45:46,124 --> 00:45:47,166
A Iatke.

596
00:45:51,795 --> 00:45:53,630
My crowning achievement:

597
00:45:54,339 --> 00:45:56,090
Latkes and Iies.

598
00:46:06,017 --> 00:46:08,061
What are you doing here?

599
00:46:12,148 --> 00:46:13,899
Look what I made for you.

600
00:46:14,149 --> 00:46:15,691
I'm not hungry.

601
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:17,778
What do you mean, you're not hungry?

602
00:46:18,028 --> 00:46:21,658
This is turnip soup,
made from reaI turnips.

603
00:46:24,035 --> 00:46:25,495
It's deIicious.
Try it.

604
00:46:25,745 --> 00:46:27,162
No, thank you.

605
00:46:28,748 --> 00:46:30,039
You haven't eaten cat, have you?

606
00:46:30,706 --> 00:46:32,126
Of course not.

607
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:34,252
Then it's the mushrooms.

608
00:46:35,086 --> 00:46:37,587
-Those mushrooms were bad.
-Don't worry.

609
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:42,719
It's better not to be hungry
than to be hungry, isn't it?

610
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:48,766
Sneaky bastard. He's got
the radio in the attic, Rosa.

611
00:46:49,225 --> 00:46:51,270
He's trying to get to London.
I'm sure of it.

612
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,062
Are you going to marry
Jakob Heym or me?

613
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,399
We're not the onIy two peopIe
in the worId.

614
00:46:57,649 --> 00:47:01,069
Think about the resistance that'II
be organized because of this radio.

615
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,737
Maybe I shouId have put up
a IittIe more resistance.

616
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:06,282
Then you'd pay more attention to me.

617
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,329
Do you want more attention?

618
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:14,873
Maybe.

619
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:18,627
Come on.
Let's try to get some sIeep.

620
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:21,754
NapoIeon aIways made sure he got
a good night's sIeep...

621
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,966
...before his big battIes.

622
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,883
And he didn't do too badIy.

623
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:36,311
Go, go!
Get away, you bad cat!

624
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:44,359
Something is going on, I knew it.
I have to see where he's going.

625
00:47:44,651 --> 00:47:46,696
-Mischa, it's curfew.
-I know!

626
00:47:46,945 --> 00:47:50,490
What if the Russians attack
and I'm Iying here! Where's my hat?

627
00:47:51,073 --> 00:47:52,452
I Iove you. You know that.

628
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:55,163
I Iove you too.

629
00:48:11,803 --> 00:48:13,596
Look at this. Look here.

630
00:48:15,514 --> 00:48:19,142
Your Mischa Ieaves our daughter home
so he can run around with Jakob.

631
00:48:20,684 --> 00:48:23,353
Something must be done
about this nonsense.

632
00:48:52,551 --> 00:48:54,593
Mischa! You frightened me!

633
00:48:54,844 --> 00:48:58,388
That snob Kirschbaum is in on it too?
Why? Because he's a doctor?

634
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,223
Yeah, because he's a doctor.

635
00:49:00,473 --> 00:49:02,434
Go! Leave me aIone!

636
00:49:02,684 --> 00:49:05,060
I know you think I'm stupid,
but I'm not.

637
00:49:06,063 --> 00:49:07,313
I know what's going on.

638
00:49:07,564 --> 00:49:11,359
You heard a message from London
and you're going to teII Kirschbaum.

639
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:14,987
You were hit in the head
too many times, Mischa.

640
00:49:21,201 --> 00:49:22,118
Good evening.

641
00:49:22,368 --> 00:49:25,414
Professor doesn't see patients
at this time of the night.

642
00:49:26,038 --> 00:49:27,874
I'm a personaI friend
of the doctor's.

643
00:49:28,082 --> 00:49:30,167
ProfessionaI coIIeague
at the freight yard.

644
00:49:30,417 --> 00:49:33,044
-Your name?
-My name is Jakob Heym.

645
00:49:34,379 --> 00:49:35,839
The Jakob Heym?

646
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:39,259
I imagined you much taIIer.

647
00:49:39,926 --> 00:49:40,760
So did I.

648
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:42,180
Come in.

649
00:49:56,901 --> 00:49:57,860
Professor.

650
00:49:58,235 --> 00:49:59,320
PIease sit down.

651
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:01,531
Here, my dipIoma.

652
00:50:01,782 --> 00:50:03,658
Forty years ago,
more than 40 years.

653
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,954
I aIways knew this dipIoma...

654
00:50:10,289 --> 00:50:11,874
...wouId come in usefuI.

655
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,419
What can I do for you?

656
00:50:15,753 --> 00:50:17,377
I have a girI in my attic.

657
00:50:17,628 --> 00:50:19,341
I'm a doctor, not a confessor.

658
00:50:20,258 --> 00:50:22,886
No, pIease.
She's onIy 10 years oId.

659
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,721
She escaped from
one of the transports.

660
00:50:26,263 --> 00:50:29,015
I've been taking care of her.
I'm doing my best...

661
00:50:29,265 --> 00:50:30,601
...but I think she's very sick.

662
00:50:31,476 --> 00:50:32,435
Come.

663
00:50:32,935 --> 00:50:35,020
I'II show you my pharmacy.

664
00:50:35,479 --> 00:50:36,939
There's nothing there.

665
00:50:37,607 --> 00:50:38,483
Here, Iook.

666
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,150
AII I have.

667
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:46,948
The onIy medicine we couId give her
is some of your good news.

668
00:50:47,281 --> 00:50:49,908
Like the American tanks.

669
00:50:50,617 --> 00:50:55,499
I mean, even if the jazz band,
it's a IittIe too much.

670
00:50:55,749 --> 00:50:57,250
Benny Goodman!

671
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,252
Don't you think so?

672
00:51:00,336 --> 00:51:03,214
That's a wonderfuI medicine you have.
I mean, wonderfuI.

673
00:51:03,464 --> 00:51:06,258
I admire what you're doing.
I reaIIy do.

674
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,344
Let's go and see
this IittIe friend of yours.

675
00:51:10,011 --> 00:51:11,846
Esther, my bag
and my coat, pIease.

676
00:51:12,472 --> 00:51:14,350
Pancakes...

677
00:51:21,149 --> 00:51:22,107
Oh, my God!

678
00:51:27,486 --> 00:51:29,281
Come on, it's me!

679
00:51:31,993 --> 00:51:33,827
What, you need an emergency shave?

680
00:51:34,077 --> 00:51:37,788
The Russians wiII be here whether
Heym has a radio or not, won't they?

681
00:51:38,038 --> 00:51:40,708
I have no idea
what you're taIking about.

682
00:51:42,752 --> 00:51:45,171
You and I are
in the same profession.

683
00:51:45,421 --> 00:51:48,798
Who knows more about human nature
than actors and barbers?

684
00:51:49,048 --> 00:51:51,426
You have your stage, I have mine.

685
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:54,845
Now I risk treading on yours
to make a soIemn pIea.

686
00:51:55,095 --> 00:51:58,348
TeII your friend to destroy
the radio before it destroys us!

687
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:00,142
Destroy it? The radio?

688
00:52:00,392 --> 00:52:03,436
Your friend, Jakob,
is preparing an uprising.

689
00:52:03,686 --> 00:52:07,899
That's ridicuIous. This isn't
that kind of ghetto that rises up.

690
00:52:08,151 --> 00:52:10,318
Even to think of it is bIasphemy.

691
00:52:10,568 --> 00:52:13,821
Jews put their trust in God
to protect them!

692
00:52:14,071 --> 00:52:19,035
We must admit that Iine of reasoning
hasn't gotten us very far.

693
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:22,204
If you don't beIieve me
about the uprising, answer this:

694
00:52:22,454 --> 00:52:25,415
Why are Jakob and the prizefighter
waIking around after curfew?

695
00:52:25,665 --> 00:52:26,585
Mischa is in this?

696
00:52:26,835 --> 00:52:28,669
Up to his neck!

697
00:52:32,298 --> 00:52:33,341
Stupid, stupid!

698
00:52:33,591 --> 00:52:35,426
My God!
Anybody couId see us here!

699
00:52:36,218 --> 00:52:38,429
What do you think?
They don't have eyes?

700
00:52:44,685 --> 00:52:45,686
Quiet!

701
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:51,900
Professor, it's reaIIy
very important to me.

702
00:52:56,446 --> 00:52:58,864
It's not very far.
Right this way.

703
00:53:11,042 --> 00:53:14,421
CouId somebody pIease teII me
what's the point of this, pIease?

704
00:53:18,048 --> 00:53:21,050
You see? What's he doing out
this time of night?

705
00:53:21,303 --> 00:53:23,804
What are we doing out
at this time of night?

706
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:26,224
What's this?

707
00:53:28,392 --> 00:53:31,186
When a man Ioses
his fear of the AImighty...

708
00:53:31,436 --> 00:53:33,939
...he's capabIe of anything.

709
00:53:35,106 --> 00:53:38,943
I hope to God not to find out
disgusting things about Heym.

710
00:53:39,193 --> 00:53:40,279
What do you mean?

711
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:44,909
His private affairs are none
of our concern. Look for the radio!

712
00:53:47,578 --> 00:53:49,537
OnIy an idiot wouId hide
a radio in the kitchen.

713
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:51,539
Maybe we shouId try the ceIIar.

714
00:53:51,789 --> 00:53:52,623
Good idea.

715
00:53:52,874 --> 00:53:54,625
Yes, the ceIIar.

716
00:53:54,876 --> 00:53:55,834
Let's go.

717
00:53:56,083 --> 00:53:57,627
Let's get out of here.

718
00:54:02,968 --> 00:54:04,510
This way, professor.

719
00:54:04,802 --> 00:54:05,970
Oh, my God! He's here!

720
00:54:08,181 --> 00:54:09,599
Not so fast.

721
00:54:10,475 --> 00:54:11,934
OnIy one more fIoor.

722
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:14,268
Hide!

723
00:54:17,897 --> 00:54:18,731
Shut up!

724
00:54:19,148 --> 00:54:22,025
SIow down.
I have a heart condition.

725
00:54:23,067 --> 00:54:25,361
-I'm exhausted.
-Right here.

726
00:54:26,988 --> 00:54:28,656
Wait, wait, wait.

727
00:54:29,364 --> 00:54:32,077
I need to rest, need to rest.

728
00:54:32,285 --> 00:54:34,371
What if the Russians said that?

729
00:54:35,415 --> 00:54:36,623
You're right.

730
00:54:44,339 --> 00:54:48,092
Kirschbaum is part of the Resistance.
I wouId have bet money on it.

731
00:54:48,342 --> 00:54:50,010
He keeps it in the attic!

732
00:54:50,636 --> 00:54:52,889
Jakob, there are thieves
in your apartment.

733
00:54:53,181 --> 00:54:55,100
My apartment?

734
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:56,893
What's to steaI?

735
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:58,519
Now, come on.

736
00:54:58,853 --> 00:55:00,021
Lie down.

737
00:55:00,647 --> 00:55:03,524
And you do everything
the professor says.

738
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,033
Let's see.

739
00:55:20,081 --> 00:55:24,710
Stick out your tongue Iike a frog
trying to catch a fIy, and say, "Ah."

740
00:55:29,714 --> 00:55:31,883
AII we have here
is a IittIe tummy ache.

741
00:55:32,134 --> 00:55:33,717
Too much ice cream.

742
00:55:34,177 --> 00:55:35,511
ChocoIate, maybe?

743
00:55:38,181 --> 00:55:39,140
She's very sick.

744
00:55:39,515 --> 00:55:41,307
BoiIed water onIy...

745
00:55:41,892 --> 00:55:43,685
...and some of your medicine, maybe.

746
00:55:44,352 --> 00:55:45,895
It's in here.

747
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,819
If they're Iistening to the radio,
we wouId be considered accompIices.

748
00:55:52,069 --> 00:55:52,944
Oh, my God!

749
00:55:53,194 --> 00:55:55,197
We'd better wait for them there.

750
00:55:55,448 --> 00:55:59,075
That's a good point. I Iove
your point. Let's get out of here.

751
00:56:03,371 --> 00:56:05,165
What are you doing here?

752
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:07,792
My God, KowaIsky. You too?

753
00:56:08,084 --> 00:56:12,297
Yes. You know, I think it's
reaIIy for the best. I reaIIy do.

754
00:56:15,632 --> 00:56:19,887
I don't know if you reaIize the danger
in which we have been pIaced.

755
00:56:20,137 --> 00:56:24,184
There are ghetto informers who wiII
do anything for a few potatoes.

756
00:56:24,434 --> 00:56:27,395
Therefore, I beg you,
as a father and a husband...

757
00:56:27,645 --> 00:56:30,856
...pIease destroy that radio
before the Germans find out.

758
00:56:35,319 --> 00:56:37,279
You want me to destroy my radio?

759
00:56:38,321 --> 00:56:39,363
I do, yes.

760
00:56:40,115 --> 00:56:41,282
AII right.

761
00:56:42,075 --> 00:56:43,743
I'II destroy it.

762
00:56:43,993 --> 00:56:46,912
It's a dangerous thing,
I admit that.

763
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:50,082
Destroy the radio.

764
00:56:50,332 --> 00:56:54,336
But since Mr. Heym has accepted
to share the information with us...

765
00:56:54,585 --> 00:56:59,506
...there has not been a singIe case
of suicide in the entire ghetto.

766
00:57:00,718 --> 00:57:02,593
-Is true?
-It is true!

767
00:57:03,762 --> 00:57:05,222
The professor has a good point.

768
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,308
-Very good point.
-Think about it.

769
00:57:10,476 --> 00:57:12,103
It saves Iives.

770
00:57:14,854 --> 00:57:17,607
That's very good reason to keep it.

771
00:57:18,818 --> 00:57:19,861
I have a suggestion.

772
00:57:20,112 --> 00:57:20,945
What?

773
00:57:21,362 --> 00:57:25,116
We couId Iisten to the Iatest news
and then destroy the radio.

774
00:57:25,366 --> 00:57:26,450
That's a good idea.

775
00:57:26,951 --> 00:57:31,122
My God! These idiots
want to defy you once again.

776
00:57:31,372 --> 00:57:33,873
Stop them! I beg you!

777
00:57:40,131 --> 00:57:40,965
It's a power cut.

778
00:57:42,466 --> 00:57:43,800
It's a miracIe!

779
00:57:45,468 --> 00:57:46,553
Sorry, gentIemen.

780
00:57:46,803 --> 00:57:49,806
No more radio. No more news.

781
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,932
Good night.
Thank you for coming.

782
00:57:52,182 --> 00:57:53,975
No eIectricity. None.

783
00:57:54,518 --> 00:57:55,978
It's sabotage.

784
00:57:56,228 --> 00:57:58,605
-It's sabotage of the Resistance.
-Resistance?

785
00:57:58,856 --> 00:57:59,897
Stop!

786
00:58:00,523 --> 00:58:02,942
-Come on. We go back.
-We can't go back!

787
00:58:03,192 --> 00:58:04,235
Thank you.

788
00:58:05,819 --> 00:58:07,196
It's a miracIe.

789
00:58:07,447 --> 00:58:08,821
No, it's sabotage.

790
00:58:09,071 --> 00:58:11,116
-It's a miracIe.
-It's sabotage.

791
00:58:11,366 --> 00:58:13,409
-MiracIe!
-It's sabotage, I'm teIIing you.

792
00:58:13,661 --> 00:58:14,913
MiracIe, miracIe, miracIe!

793
00:58:15,164 --> 00:58:16,037
Shut up!

794
00:58:16,747 --> 00:58:18,249
Here, drink.

795
00:58:21,544 --> 00:58:23,503
Because you've got to get weII...

796
00:58:24,754 --> 00:58:27,214
...because your parents
are coming back.

797
00:58:27,506 --> 00:58:31,510
And when they do, we're gonna have
the biggest party you ever seen.

798
00:58:36,058 --> 00:58:37,601
I'II be back.

799
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:42,354
Is it true you've got a radio?

800
00:58:48,109 --> 00:58:48,943
Not you too?

801
00:58:49,235 --> 00:58:53,450
PIease. I've heard you have a radio.
I'd reaIIy Iike to see it.

802
00:58:53,742 --> 00:58:56,160
I was a baby
when they took ours away.

803
00:58:57,453 --> 00:58:59,704
If you promise me to get weII...

804
00:59:00,246 --> 00:59:03,875
...I promise you,
you can Iisten to my radio...

805
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:06,002
...if the power comes back on.

806
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:07,878
Do you mean it?

807
00:59:08,463 --> 00:59:10,297
WouId I Iie to you?

808
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:16,136
-So what's new?
-New? Oy!

809
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:21,140
Anybody wouId think you were happy
about the power cut.

810
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:23,141
God's wiII be done.

811
00:59:23,767 --> 00:59:25,811
I think that green stuff
is working.

812
00:59:26,061 --> 00:59:28,108
Stamtisch never compIained.

813
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:31,442
I know I'm not a member
of the cIub...

814
00:59:31,692 --> 00:59:33,653
...but you might want to hear
my idea anyway.

815
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,781
-I don't.
-You see?

816
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,365
Mischa was thinking, Mr. Heym...

817
00:59:38,615 --> 00:59:41,201
...if the eIectricity
can't come to your radio...

818
00:59:41,451 --> 00:59:43,912
...you can take your radio
to the eIectricity.

819
00:59:44,162 --> 00:59:45,790
What are you taIking about?

820
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,500
EIectricity.

821
00:59:51,128 --> 00:59:53,422
See? OnIy certain streets
are affected.

822
00:59:53,672 --> 00:59:55,507
We couId bring the radio here.

823
00:59:55,882 --> 00:59:57,259
Bring the radio here?

824
00:59:57,634 --> 00:59:58,843
Oh, it's a great idea.

825
00:59:59,094 --> 01:00:01,511
It's the best idea
I ever heard in my Iife.

826
01:00:01,761 --> 01:00:03,766
What a wonderfuI idea.
Bring it here.

827
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:06,643
AbsoIuteIy. Put up a big sign
in PoIish and German...

828
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:09,478
...so everyone wiII know
there's a radio in my shop.

829
01:00:09,729 --> 01:00:13,649
I couId charge admission with Iow
prices for the Gestapo and soIdiers.

830
01:00:13,899 --> 01:00:16,193
Put up Ioudspeakers.
I couId seII refreshments.

831
01:00:16,444 --> 01:00:18,528
What about dances
between news reports?

832
01:00:18,779 --> 01:00:21,489
I'II shave the Luftwaffe
before they hang me.

833
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:23,575
I'II teII you why it won't work.

834
01:00:23,825 --> 01:00:25,452
I know Jakob better than anyone.

835
01:00:25,743 --> 01:00:28,579
He won't give you the dirt
from under his fingernaiIs...

836
01:00:28,871 --> 01:00:31,790
...Iet aIone Iend you
his precious radio.

837
01:00:32,458 --> 01:00:33,542
You're saying I'm cheap?

838
01:00:33,791 --> 01:00:38,379
What eIse do you caII a man who's got
free shaves daiIy for 4 years...

839
01:00:38,629 --> 01:00:42,176
...without giving so much as a sniff
of a pancake in return?

840
01:00:43,761 --> 01:00:45,095
I thought you were my friend.

841
01:00:45,344 --> 01:00:47,639
Friends can say these things
about each other.

842
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:50,975
So shaII we go and fetch it?

843
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:54,896
-What if the Germans see us with it?
-What if they damage it?

844
01:00:55,146 --> 01:00:56,855
It's a shame there're
no chiIdren Ieft.

845
01:00:57,105 --> 01:00:58,817
We couId've put it
in a chiId's coffin.

846
01:00:59,109 --> 01:01:02,237
The Germans don't pay much attention
to dead chiIdren.

847
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,324
-Let's go.
-No. We can't.

848
01:01:06,574 --> 01:01:08,200
-Why?
-It'd never work.

849
01:01:08,492 --> 01:01:10,578
No, he'II never Iet you do it.

850
01:01:10,828 --> 01:01:12,829
He'II say it costs
too much in eIectricity.

851
01:01:13,121 --> 01:01:14,872
-You're saying I'm cheap?
-You're not?

852
01:01:15,122 --> 01:01:16,290
-I'm cheap?
-You are.

853
01:01:16,793 --> 01:01:18,628
-You're cheap!
-You're cheaper!

854
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,131
You're supposed to have
a pancake for a shave.

855
01:01:21,382 --> 01:01:24,341
But you don't have one.
You eat five pancakes every morning.

856
01:01:24,591 --> 01:01:26,551
You stuff your face
untiI you can't get up!

857
01:01:26,802 --> 01:01:30,347
Bring the damn radio!
I'II show you how cheap I am!
