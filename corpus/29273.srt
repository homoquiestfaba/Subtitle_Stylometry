1
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:23,523
(rhythmic, melancholy melody
plays quietly )

2
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:27,235
( wind whistling )

3
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,195
( melody builds slowly )

4
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:33,116
( melody crescendos
and continues )

5
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:07,400
( melody continues )

6
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,090
( water splashing gently )

7
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,550
MAN:
Ain't got all day.

8
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,802
BOY:
Dad, I can't.

9
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,095
Ain't got all day, boy.

10
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,429
( feet stumbling )

11
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,558
( gasping )

12
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,019
Come on, boy.

13
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,854
Help...!

14
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:45,897
( gasps )

15
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,273
You can do it.

16
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,609
Come on...

17
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,945
Let me see you
move your arms.

18
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,863
Kick your legs.

19
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,991
You can do it.

20
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,121
( water bubbling )

21
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:04,249
DAD ( muffled ):
Come on!

22
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,836
You're not trying!

23
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,422
Nobody's gonna make
it easy for you!

24
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,798
It's up to you!

25
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,925
QUOYLE:
I used to imagine

26
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:18,138
that I'd been given
to the wrong family at birth

27
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:22,308
and that somewhere
in the world

28
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:26,187
my real people longed for me.

29
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,231
From where my father stood

30
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,066
my failure to dog-paddle

31
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,193
was only the first
of many failures.

32
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,613
Failure to speak clearly.

33
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,615
Failure to sit up straight.

34
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,535
Failure to make friends
every time we moved

35
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,620
to another dreary upstate town.

36
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:48,460
In me, my father recognized
a failed life--

37
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,463
his own.

38
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,049
When I got admitted
to the junior college

39
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,593
my father figured
it was a clerical error.

40
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,636
When I dropped out
a year later

41
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,804
he wasn't surprised.

42
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,514
Quoyle!

43
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,184
Quoyle!

44
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,519
Job not stimulating
enough for you?

45
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,189
No. I mean, yes.

46
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,732
I mean...

47
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,776
This is the best work
I've ever had.

48
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,819
( machinery clanking )

49
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,238
( bell rings )

50
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,021
QUOYLE:
I stumbled into adulthood

51
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,608
learning to separate
my feelings from my life...

52
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,610
counting on nothing.

53
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,196
( man and woman arguing )

54
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,658
I got used to being invisible.

55
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,995
Until... someone noticed me.

56
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,914
( muffled yelling )

57
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,916
( wipers sound like heartbeat )

58
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,752
I'm sick of this shit!

59
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:19,217
( loud argument continues
indistinctly )

60
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,434
Where you going, Petal?

61
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,315
Let's go.

62
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,527
Wake up! Go!

63
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:38,570
( pounding )

64
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,071
( tires squeal )

65
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,163
What's your name?

66
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,123
Quoyle.

67
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,499
Are you all right?

68
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,085
I'm starving, Quoyle.
Aren't you?

69
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,674
I sell burglar alarms.

70
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,552
Really?

71
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,263
That-that must be
interesting work.

72
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,931
I'm an ink setter.

73
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,602
I work for
the Poughkeepsie News.

74
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,277
You haven't touched
your food.

75
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,279
Oh.

76
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,239
( anxious sigh )

77
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:36,753
So, what do you think?

78
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:41,591
You want to marry
me, don't you?

79
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,010
Huh?

80
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,262
It's 8:05.

81
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,184
I think I'm gonna fuck you
by 10:00.

82
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,311
What do you think of that?

83
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,313
( passionate breathing )

84
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:06,574
( breathing slows and echoes )

85
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,993
( echoing slows, dreamlike )

86
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,040
( passionate moaning )

87
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,504
( both gasping )

88
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,217
Oh, my God.

89
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,554
That was the
biggest one yet.

90
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,597
( exhausted sigh )

91
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,815
Yeah... I'm always hungry
after I get laid.

92
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:42,485
I guess 'cause I... I burn up
so many calories.

93
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,533
You live in a
dump, Quoyle.

94
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,660
( weakly ):
I love you.

95
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,247
( baby voice ):
Oh...

96
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,374
( weakly):
I love you.

97
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,418
( gasping breaths )

98
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,846
( baby voice ):
Nibble, nibble

99
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,182
Little mouse.

100
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,613
What'd the
doctor say?

101
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:30,116
If I end up with stretch marks,
sue his ass.

102
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,578
Yeah, but, Petal, Petal,
is everything okay?

103
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,580
QUOYLE:
Petal? Petal?

104
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,748
( splashing )

105
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,042
Petal, you're the only
woman I've ever loved.

106
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,753
You're-you're the only one.

107
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,297
Mm-hmm-- how do you make
an Alabama Slamma?

108
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,466
Where are you, sweetheart?

109
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,635
Alabama, that's the point.

110
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,803
Look, look up the recipe.

111
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,805
It's on the fridge
where I keep the Mr. Boston.

112
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,640
If you come home,
I'll make one for you.

113
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:54,724
( baby whimpers )

114
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,811
Oh, Christ, never mind.

115
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,187
I'll have a vodka.

116
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:03,608
( baby cries )

117
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,611
Oh, oh, it's okay,
Bunny, honey.

118
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,488
Oh, I know...

119
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,327
( TV playing )

120
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,457
( man yelling outside )

121
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,306
( woman and man laughing )

122
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,564
MAN:
All right, baby.

123
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,274
( Petal laughs )

124
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,403
( announcer speaking Spanish )

125
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:52,198
( Petal laughing sensually )

126
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,242
( loud thud, crowd cheers )

127
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:57,829
( laughter echoing,
referee's whistle blows )

128
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,342
( grunts )

129
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,595
Has your friend gone?

130
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,931
( laughing ):
My "friend."

131
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,683
( sighs )

132
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,352
Oh, shit.

133
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,519
( heavy sigh )

134
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,733
Don't do that!
Don't touch me.

135
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,735
( sighing )

136
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,618
Stop doing stuff--

137
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,162
creeping around, cleaning up.

138
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,501
Look...

139
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,504
it's no good.

140
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,132
Find yourself
a girlfriend.

141
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:54,386
I don't want a girlfriend;
I want you.

142
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,429
Your funeral.

143
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,641
Listen, you going
to be home for dinner?

144
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,226
Don't expect me.

145
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,894
-Bunny's missed you, and...
-Hey, Petal.

146
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:03,895
Hey, Bunny Rabbit.

147
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,397
Petal's got to run.

148
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,899
BUNNY:
That's so pretty.

149
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,236
( popping tab )

150
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,779
Here. So's that.

151
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,489
Thanks.

152
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,535
Beautiful.

153
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,536
( beads clatter)

154
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,829
Oh, shit!

155
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,539
( Petal sighs )

156
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,798
Sorry.

157
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,800
That's okay.

158
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,847
( machinery clanking )

159
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,481
( beep )

160
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,151
Hi, this message
is for Daniel Smith

161
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,279
confirming your appointment
with Dr. Davis today at noon.

162
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,321
( beeps )

163
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:59,159
Quoyle?
This is your father.

164
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,496
Lost your home number.

165
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:07,125
It's time for your mother and l
to put an end to it.

166
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,128
I left instructions
with the undertaker--

167
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,129
Dayton & Sons.

168
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:15,300
Told them to notify my sister,
Agnis Hamm.

169
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:19,137
Not much of a life.

170
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,681
Nobody gave me nothing.

171
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,185
Other men would've given up
and turned into bums

172
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,270
but I didn't.

173
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:30,190
I went without
so you could have advantages.

174
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:34,277
Not that you done anything
with them.

175
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,695
( beep and click )

176
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:41,201
What, were they sick
or something?

177
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,286
PETAL:
Oh, come on.

178
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,330
They must've left something.

179
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,623
What's their house worth?

180
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,833
QUOYLE:
No, Petal,
the bank is taking it.

181
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,168
There's nothing left.

182
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,671
There were medical bills,
and funeral costs, and...

183
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,006
It's all gone, honey.

184
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,050
You wanna marry me,
don't you?

185
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,553
I won't have
to go to school?

186
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:01,763
It's an adventure.

187
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,265
Who goes to school
when they're on an adventure?

188
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,517
Is Daddy coming?

189
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,394
No. Daddy is boring.

190
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,979
Daddy's boring?

191
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,106
Mm-hmm. That's right.

192
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,732
You're a very clever girl.

193
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,734
( TV playing )

194
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,112
There's Frank.
Come on, he's waitin'.

195
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,364
Hey, big guy!

196
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,866
Good-bye.

197
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,247
Hey, hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

198
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,540
What about my pay?!

199
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,666
( radio blaring )

200
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,042
( tires screeching )

201
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,423
What about my pay?

202
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,967
You owe me for three weeks.

203
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,679
QUOYLE:
Yes, Quoyle.

204
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,389
Q-U-O-Y-L-E.

205
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,932
Quoyle.

206
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,934
She didn't leave me

207
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:50,311
a message or anything--
a note somewhere?

208
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:51,688
Only for you to pay me.

209
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,567
What? Uh, yeah, Bunny.

210
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,862
Bunny. Yes, that's,
that's her name.

211
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,072
( fading out ):
She's, uh, six years old.

212
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:06,244
And Petal. Petal, yes...

213
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,458
( knocking )

214
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:16,755
Agnis Hamm.

215
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,174
Half-sister
of Guy Quoyle.

216
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,633
I'm your aunt.

217
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,635
This is a really bad time.

218
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,262
So I heard.

219
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,057
I'm here to visit
his ashes.

220
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:30,894
No, I mean this is
a really, really bad time.

221
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,188
QUOYLE:
She's never done anything
like this.

222
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,647
I mean, she's
walked out before

223
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,441
but she's never,
never taken Bunny.

224
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,776
I don't understand.

225
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,819
The potato chips
won't do you any good.

226
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,071
-Drink your tea.
-Huh?

227
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,323
Tea's a good drink.
Keep you going.

228
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:51,456
Do you think maybe you could
stick around for awhile?

229
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,542
Sorry, just passing through.

230
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:03,259
On my way to Newfoundland,
where our people come from.

231
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,844
You ever been there, nephew?

232
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,433
Only I want to say
farewell to Guy first

233
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:13,645
if you'll tell me
where he is.

234
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:16,314
Oh. Uh, sorry.

235
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,442
He's the one
on the left.

236
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:24,072
( phone ringing )

237
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,869
Petal, hello!
Is that you? Hello?

238
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,746
MAN ( over phone ):
Mr. Quoyle?

239
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,164
Oh. Uh, yes, it is.

240
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,917
This is Investigator Danzig
from the New York State Police.

241
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,836
Oh, Jesus, have you found 'em?

242
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,004
-Yes, sir.
-Yeah?

243
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,672
( loud bang )
Ow! Jesus!

244
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:41,965
Goddamn it!

245
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,174
Hang on a second.
Hello?

246
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,260
-Yes, sir, I'm still here.
-Are you...?

247
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,261
Oh, thank God.

248
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,637
Hello.
Can you hear me?

249
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,888
That's not a problem.

250
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,265
Yeah. Uh, how's Bunny?

251
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,266
You know what

252
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,393
I think she's gonna
be all right.

253
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:55,562
Oh, Jesus, good.
And, and Petal?

254
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,813
Mr. Quoyle

255
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,690
we'll talk about that
when we get there.

256
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,192
Uh-huh. You're gonna,
you're gonna bring her here?

257
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,193
Yes, sir.

258
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,112
Okay. And you have
the address?

259
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,155
Yes, we do.

260
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,364
Oh, good.
And Petal?

261
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,117
Relax, sir, we'll be
there as soon as we can.

262
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,744
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.

263
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,746
They're gonna bring Petal;
they're gonna bring Bunny.

264
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:13,997
They found 'em.

265
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,623
The cop said he's
got something

266
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,916
to tell me about Petal.

267
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,877
I hope she didn't get
in any trouble.

268
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,378
She's got such a temper on her.

269
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,088
There's just no telling
what she...

270
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,174
( motor rumbling )

271
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:27,093
DANZIG:
The convertible went over
a guardrail in Jersey.

272
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,263
Fortunately, your daughter was
no longer traveling

273
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:33,350
with Mrs. Quoyle and, uh,
and her male companion.

274
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:37,270
She was mercifully
killed on impact

275
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:39,397
I can promise you.

276
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,234
Look, uh, there is
something else.

277
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,653
Seems she sold your daughter

278
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:49,616
to a black market adoption
outfit for $6,000.

279
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:53,787
There was even a receipt,
if you can imagine.

280
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,414
That's how we tracked her.

281
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,416
Daddy!

282
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,170
Daddy!

283
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,338
Hi, sweetheart.

284
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,966
BUNNY:
Who's that?

285
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,386
That's your
great-aunt Agnis.

286
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,179
Where's Petal?

287
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:13,807
Mommy!

288
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,562
Mommy?

289
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,066
Mommy?

290
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:27,779
Maybe I could stay
just a day or two.

291
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,283
"Your loved one has
not left your heart

292
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,619
"or your thoughts

293
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:38,331
but is sleeping
peacefully."

294
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,500
She's sleeping?

295
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:45,547
Yes. Peacefully.

296
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,424
-( groans )
-In heaven.

297
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,134
With the angels.

298
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,760
( sighs )

299
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:57,183
If I was asleep,
I'd wake up.

300
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:06,192
Why are you so scared,
Daddy?

301
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,709
( Quoyle weeping )

302
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,594
What do I do?

303
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,662
AGNIS:
It takes a year, nephew--

304
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:02,540
a full turn ofthe calendar,
to get over losing someone.

305
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,585
That's a true sayin'.

306
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:09,005
The move'll help. You'll see.

307
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,595
What place on earth could be
better than...

308
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:18,390
the place your people
came from?

309
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,934
Smell that clean
northern sea?

310
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,728
I'm not a water person.

311
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,565
At least the girl is.

312
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,070
QUOYLE:
I hope we're doing
the right thing, Aunt.

313
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,072
AGNIS:
I thought I'd never
come back here.

314
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:37,075
But the older you get

315
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,077
there's an ache, a pull...

316
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,080
something you've
got to figure out.

317
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,916
Like you're a piece
in a puzzle.

318
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:03,184
It takes some time to get used
to the rock 'neath you.

319
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:05,895
It's a place like no other.

320
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:08,940
The people who came here
came by accident.

321
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:12,402
Those that stayed learned
strange things can happen--

322
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:17,032
omens and restless spirits...

323
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,117
magic.

324
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:22,454
We Quoyles,
we left it 50 year ago.

325
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,623
Hard times.

326
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,626
( sighs )

327
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:31,838
We're nearly there.

328
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,256
Quoyle Point.

329
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:36,634
Named after us. You.

330
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,303
Well, I don't understand.

331
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,472
It's May, there's so much snow.

332
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,140
Up here, forget everything

333
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,642
you thought you knew
about the weather.

334
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,756
I was born in that house.

335
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,219
( seagulls calling )

336
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,222
( waves roaring )

337
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,769
AGNIS:
Empty 44 years--

338
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,521
Look at that roofline.

339
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,691
Straight as a ruler.

340
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:35,694
( doorknob rattling )

341
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,580
( water dripping )

342
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,962
( gulls calling )

343
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,524
Look.

344
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,029
QUOYLE:
I wonder who that is.

345
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,448
It's your grandfather,
Sian Quoyle.

346
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,116
Died before I was born.

347
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:27,078
Died young-- 12 year old.

348
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,330
Twelve?

349
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:30,665
Then he couldn't have been
my grandfather.

350
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,585
You don't know Newfoundlanders.

351
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,754
Who's this?

352
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,841
It's my father and...

353
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,927
and you.

354
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:48,058
I never did care for that hat.

355
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,060
( coughs )

356
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,689
Oh!

357
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:56,483
My Lord, the table!

358
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,151
The blessed table!

359
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:59,986
( chuckles )

360
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,035
There's no way we can live here.

361
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:08,620
It's all fixable.

362
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,246
We'll get a carpenter.

363
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:13,667
Oh, well, it might be cheaper
if we just build

364
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,169
a whole new house
on the Riviera.

365
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:19,381
Only I wasn't born
on the Riviera.

366
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:22,884
( rain pouring )

367
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:25,178
( wind howling )

368
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,222
( rattling and creaking )

369
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:48,910
( wind whistling )

370
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:11,641
Daddy?

371
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:13,560
What?

372
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,815
Why did you wake me up?

373
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:22,193
I wanted to see
if you were asleep.

374
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,755
( water bubbling and swirling )

375
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:50,638
( no audio )

376
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,121
( door squeaking open
and closed )

377
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:23,713
Are these cables so the house
won't blow away?

378
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:25,423
So far so good.

379
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:26,841
They say it

380
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:28,802
rocked in storms like
a big rocking chair.

381
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:30,804
Made the women sick,
so they lashed it down.

382
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:33,973
QUOYLE:
They're moaning.

383
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:36,226
The house is sad.

384
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,937
What?

385
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:43,191
You should let it loose.

386
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:45,985
( laughs )

387
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,798
QUOYLE:
I'm here to apply for a job.

388
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,383
Come on in.

389
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:11,094
Listen here...
Listen here, my son.

390
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:14,222
I'm going to need
clarification on this.

391
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:17,350
I got Doris Koontz down as
runner-up in "Cakes and Muffins"

392
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,436
but her entry is listed

393
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:21,021
as "Strawberry
Rhubarb Cobbler"

394
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:23,189
which I believe ought
to be under "Pies."

395
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:24,607
Name's Tert Card--

396
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:27,569
managing editor, rewrite man,
and snow shoveller.

397
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,821
You'll have to do
without the boss.

398
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:32,866
Himself, Jack Buggit, has
called in sick, as per usual.

399
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:35,660
Which is why I am occupying
his office, Billy Pretty

400
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,620
and no bones about it.

401
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:39,497
Come in.

402
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:41,958
Name?

403
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,251
Uh, Quoyle.

404
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:45,337
I just got here yesterday
from New York...

405
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:46,880
Ah, you're a Quoyle, are you?

406
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:49,591
Well, I should've
seen that right off.

407
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:50,717
Sit down.

408
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:54,929
Prior experience
as a journalist?

409
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:56,598
Washington Post?

410
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:57,932
London Times?

411
00:25:57,974 --> 00:26:00,060
Oh, oh, no,
I'm not a journalist.

412
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:01,353
I'm an ink setter.

413
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,980
( phone rings )
I had that position...

414
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:05,106
Gammy Bird.

415
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:06,733
JACK:
Are you in my office, Tert?

416
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:08,234
No, no, no, Jack.

417
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:11,613
I'm just conducting a job
interview here at my desk.

418
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:12,822
Job interview?

419
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,282
Yeah, there's a Mr. Quoyle here.

420
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:16,076
Says he's
an ink setter.

421
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:18,078
The fella's a Quoyle, you say?

422
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,788
And no mistake.

423
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:21,039
Hmm.

424
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:22,916
Have him
meet me at the dock in, uh

425
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:24,501
one hour.

426
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:26,711
That bronchitis of yours
cleared up already?

427
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:28,129
Much better.

428
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:29,881
Thanks for your concern.

429
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:32,008
Okay, Jack.

430
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:37,138
Quoyle!
Over here.

431
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,015
Step lively.

432
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:46,231
Uh... hello there, Mr. Buggit.
The man at the...

433
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:47,774
The name's Jack.

434
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,359
Come on, get in.

435
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,706
I'm not a water person.

436
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:04,833
All Quoyles
is water people.

437
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:06,543
Boats is in your blood.

438
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:08,420
That's why
I'm hiring you.

439
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:11,297
I need somebody to cover
the shipping news.

440
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:14,342
You'll get a list
from the harbormaster--

441
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:16,594
what ships go in
to Killick-Claw...

442
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:18,638
But, Mr. Buggit,
I-I-I'm an ink setter.

443
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,432
Pay attention, me old son.

444
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:23,435
I don't need no ink setter,
I need a reporter.

445
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:25,520
And you'll do
Local car wrecks.

446
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:28,815
Take the picture,
write the story.

447
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:32,277
We run a front-page photo
of a car wreck every week

448
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:35,196
whether or not
we actually have a car wreck.

449
00:27:35,238 --> 00:27:37,574
Now, there's a knack
for taking photos

450
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:39,451
that make you
feel something.

451
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:41,786
If there's a dark
patch on the ground

452
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:45,457
it reads blood whether it's
motor oil or Diet Coke.

453
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:48,626
And you want
something human, uh

454
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:50,462
a child's mitten, a purse

455
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:52,130
a baseball cap
lying in the road.

456
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:54,090
See, that's what makes it human.

457
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:55,633
That's what makes
the reader feel.

458
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,218
Jack, I'm, I'm no reporter.

459
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,970
Jesus Sweet Christ.

460
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:02,891
You think any of them tomcods
knew how to write

461
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:04,184
when I hired them?

462
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:06,853
I get a feeling
about people

463
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:08,938
that's all.

464
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:36,049
( urinating )

465
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:42,222
Welcome home, Guy.

466
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:46,351
QUOYLE:
I can't do it.

467
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:47,602
I mean, even
if I knew

468
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:50,271
the first thing about writing,
which I don't, I...

469
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:51,981
Car crashes--
I can't cover those.

470
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:53,650
Why not?

471
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:57,153
You know why not.

472
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,032
We face up to the things
we're afraid of

473
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:02,534
because we can't go around them.

474
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:05,036
Car wrecks are

475
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:06,371
a fact of life
up here.

476
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:08,540
Come winter, a drive
into town'll be

477
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:09,749
damn near impossible.

478
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:12,252
We'll buy
us a boat.

479
00:29:12,293 --> 00:29:16,047
Look, I already told you,
I'm not a water person.

480
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:19,259
They dragged it here.

481
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,053
What, honey?

482
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:25,181
The house.
They dragged it here.

483
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:27,267
You must've had a dream,
sweetheart.

484
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:28,977
Who told you about that?

485
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:37,444
A long time ago,
on Gaze Island

486
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:41,364
the old Quoyles couldn't make
a go of it there

487
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:45,160
so they lashed the house with
ropes and they dragged it.

488
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:47,495
Yeah, they
dragged it.

489
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:50,373
Across the ice,
clear to the mainland.

490
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:52,375
Right here.

491
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:54,377
( rope creaking )

492
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,379
( wind whistling )

493
00:29:58,173 --> 00:30:02,510
( driving Celtic drums )

494
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:10,977
( rumbling and creaking )

495
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:19,986
( strained groaning )

496
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:25,367
( drums stop )

497
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:27,911
( house cables gently moaning )

498
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:45,804
QUOYLE:
This is from the "News
of Your Neighbors" column.

499
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:48,807
"The pole on the corner of Main
and West Streets

500
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:50,558
"has a sign on it that says

501
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,478
"it's illegal to place anything
on that pole.

502
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,398
"We see the postman
has landed in the clink

503
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:59,609
"for throwing the mail in
Killick-Claw Harbor.

504
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:01,361
"He said he had too much
to deliver

505
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:04,406
"and the folks could just take
a dip and help themselves.

506
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:06,741
Guess it helps
if you can swim."

507
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:07,993
This is professional stuff.

508
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:09,536
How am I supposed to write this?

509
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:10,578
BUNNY:
You can't.

510
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,497
You'll get it wrong.

511
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,541
Here now, miss! Don't you talk
to your father like that!

512
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:15,834
Course he can do it.

513
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:18,503
Petal says
Dad never gets anything right.

514
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:20,964
Yeah, well, it'll work out.

515
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:27,012
( banging)

516
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:31,057
( staticky radio
transmission )

517
00:31:35,395 --> 00:31:36,479
Hello.

518
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:38,857
You must be Quoyle.

519
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,567
B. Beaufield Nutbeem.

520
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:43,695
I head up the Foreign
News Department.

521
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:46,656
Steals every story off
that goddamn shortwave.

522
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:49,326
Which Tert takes the
liberty of rewriting

523
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:51,036
in his own
mystical tongue.

524
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:53,705
Only to save you from charges
of plagiarism, Nutbeem.

525
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:55,790
NUTBEEM:
Ah, Mr. Billy Pretty

526
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:58,501
an old fish dog
and local landmark.

527
00:31:58,543 --> 00:31:59,878
Edits the
Home News Page--

528
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,713
poems, baby photos,
household tips.

529
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:04,799
There's your desk, Quoyle.

530
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:14,559
Is there, um, a computer?

531
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:16,436
Well, do you see one?

532
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:20,648
No, I just...
I see everyone else...

533
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:22,025
Keen powers of observation.

534
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:24,903
I can see why Jack snatched you
off the job market.

535
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:26,237
( phone rings )

536
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:28,323
( chair squeaks )

537
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:31,201
TERT:
Gammy Bird.

538
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:32,744
Uh-huh.

539
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:35,955
Right on to it.

540
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:38,249
Well, Quoyle, you
lead a charmed life.

541
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:39,292
Two minutes on the job

542
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:41,002
and you got
your first car wreck.

543
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:46,549
FIREMAN:
As far as I can tell,
the site is really fresh

544
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:48,885
about 10, 15 minutes,
uh, at the most.

545
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:51,471
You got two victims--
one male, one female.

546
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:53,223
Not one vital sign between them

547
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:55,642
so we're gonna wait
till the police come now.

548
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:58,019
Uh, the rate of speed
we estimate at 65

549
00:32:58,061 --> 00:32:59,979
so there's
nothing unlawful here.

550
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:02,148
There's not a whole lot
you can do, right

551
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,275
when a moose decides
to get in your way.

552
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:05,485
BILLY:
That's for sure.

553
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:06,611
Uh... the driver

554
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:08,154
most likely
had his chest crushed

555
00:33:08,196 --> 00:33:10,657
before the car hit the water,
so at least that's a mercy.

556
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:11,908
Yeah. Yeah.

557
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,284
Yeah.

558
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:15,412
Yeah. Well, there's that,
and the-- and the moose

559
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:16,788
you know,
which is a gift really

560
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,498
when you think about it--
out of season

561
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,083
Like that--
a moose that size.

562
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:21,126
BILLY:
Oh, Lord, yes.

563
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,961
Billy, I suppose
we could split it

564
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:23,962
four ways, right?

565
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:25,630
( shutter clicks )

566
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:27,424
How much could you fit
in the station wagon there?

567
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:28,425
I'll take
the hind quarter.

568
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:30,051
I know we're
gonna want to use

569
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:32,637
some of those recipes from
the "Home Page," you know?

570
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:35,015
( retching )
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

571
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:37,642
He's new, is he?

572
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:40,937
New fella.

573
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:42,439
BILLY:
There you go.

574
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,775
It's wrecks like that
that sells papers.

575
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:47,318
Oh, Jack knows his readers.

576
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,864
Now, mind you, there's more
people down under these waters

577
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:53,575
than are killed
on the roads.

578
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:56,077
You'll want to get yourself
a nice little boat before long.

579
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:58,038
Something that fits
the water.

580
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:00,874
I just don't want
to think about a boat right...

581
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:02,625
Wh-Who's that?

582
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:06,504
Why?

583
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:09,591
Oh, I... I was just curious.
I've seen her around.

584
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:10,592
She's very tall.

585
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:12,135
I... I mean

586
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:14,596
she... she's got good posture.

587
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:17,140
She seems very...

588
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:19,351
her stride
is different.

589
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:25,648
It was grief that caused her boy
to be not right.

590
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:28,777
She was carrying him when
her husband was drowned at sea.

591
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:30,654
Like I was saying,
there's more life

592
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:33,823
Lost that way.

593
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:44,542
How's your car wreck coming,
Quoyle?

594
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:50,507
If I wanted War and Peace

595
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:53,385
I would have hired
William Bloody Shakespeare.

596
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:15,865
( sighs )

597
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:19,869
"The policeman ate breakfast
at the Codcake Diner

598
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:23,081
before he arrived
at the accident scene"?

599
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:32,799
Yes?

600
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:34,050
Your spelling is fine

601
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:36,052
and I've seen
plenty worse grammar.

602
00:35:36,136 --> 00:35:38,596
But-but finding
the center of your story--

603
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:40,098
the beating heart of it--

604
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,558
that's what makes
a reporter.

605
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,394
Now, you'll have to start
by making up some headlines.

606
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:45,770
You know?

607
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:49,024
Short, punchy,
dramatic headlines.

608
00:35:49,065 --> 00:35:51,026
Now, have a look.
What do you see?

609
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:52,402
Tell me the headline.

610
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:58,408
Horizon Fills
with Dark Clouds.

611
00:35:58,491 --> 00:36:00,869
Imminent Storm
Threatens Village.

612
00:36:03,955 --> 00:36:05,790
But what if no
storm comes?

613
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:09,461
Village Spared
from Deadly Storm.

614
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:18,928
( seagulls calling )

615
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,764
( waves rolling in )

616
00:36:20,805 --> 00:36:22,891
AGNIS:
How was your first day?

617
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:24,184
What's all this?

618
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:28,646
Nephew, we can't fix up
the house proper

619
00:36:28,688 --> 00:36:31,232
on a journalist's wages,
so I've un-retired.

620
00:36:31,274 --> 00:36:32,275
From what?

621
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:33,526
Boat upholstery.

622
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:35,987
All us Quoyles have
a feeling for boats.

623
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:37,489
QUOYLE:
Who-who's this?

624
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,991
That's Dennis Buggit,
master carpenter.

625
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:43,119
Ah, only till I gets
me lobster license.

626
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:45,163
I'm a fisherman
in me soul.

627
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:46,748
QUOYLE:
Buggit, huh?

628
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:49,042
You-you wouldn't
be related

629
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:50,669
to my boss
down at the Gammy Bird?

630
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:52,087
Mm-hmm.

631
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:54,255
Yeah, yeah.
My dad.

632
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:57,884
Tomorrow I'll run two-by-fours
under your second story.

633
00:36:57,926 --> 00:37:00,178
Oh, and, uh, I was you

634
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,764
I wouldn't sleep in
your upstairs tonight

635
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:06,184
unless you want to wake up
downstairs with a thud.

636
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:08,019
( chuckling ):
Yeah.

637
00:37:08,061 --> 00:37:10,188
Yes, boy.

638
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:13,024
( wind rushing )

639
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:16,027
( snoring )

640
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:33,837
( snoring continues )

641
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:42,178
( screams )

642
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,431
What? What?
What is it? What is it?

643
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:45,598
A ghost.

644
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,434
The window.

645
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:49,728
A skinny ghost,
and a white dog.

646
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:52,605
I-I didn't dream it.
Don't say I did.

647
00:37:52,647 --> 00:37:54,441
I won't, I won't,
sweetheart, okay.

648
00:37:54,482 --> 00:37:55,567
There's a ghost there...

649
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:56,818
Okay, okay, shh, okay.

650
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:00,030
Okay, shh...

651
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:02,866
Okay...

652
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:05,368
( whispers ):
Okay. Shh.

653
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:08,872
( children shouting
indistinctly )

654
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:12,709
Oh, excuse me?

655
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:15,253
This is our first day
at school.

656
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:16,504
-I don't like these kids.
-Bunny.

657
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:18,465
-Um, she's in the after-school--
-They're boring!

658
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:20,467
Boring, boring, boring!

659
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:22,969
Bunny, that's enough.

660
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:25,722
I'm sorry. She's-she's not
usually like this.

661
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:27,057
Not usually
Like what?

662
00:38:27,098 --> 00:38:30,977
I hate going to new places
where I don't know anybody.

663
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:33,521
I don't know anybody.

664
00:38:33,563 --> 00:38:35,732
( giggles )

665
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:37,776
What's wrong with him?

666
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:39,736
Bunny, that is...
There is nothing wrong

667
00:38:39,778 --> 00:38:40,737
with him, all right?

668
00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:41,946
This is Herry.

669
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:43,531
When he was being born

670
00:38:43,573 --> 00:38:45,367
he didn't get enough air
to breathe

671
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:48,244
and that makes him a little
slower than most people.

672
00:38:48,286 --> 00:38:50,246
What's your name?

673
00:38:50,288 --> 00:38:51,623
Bunny.

674
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:53,917
A bunny rabbit.

675
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:56,169
That's what
my mother calls me.

676
00:38:56,211 --> 00:38:57,587
Is Mommy at
work now?

677
00:38:57,629 --> 00:39:00,006
No, she's asleep
with the angels.

678
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:03,468
I am a bunny rabbit.

679
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:06,846
Oh, you certainly are.

680
00:39:06,888 --> 00:39:08,723
( Bunny laughs )

681
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:10,225
Boing, boing, boing, boing...

682
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:15,522
Whi-Which of those women
are in charge here?

683
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:17,232
Neither of them.
They're just moms.

684
00:39:17,273 --> 00:39:19,526
Oh, 'cause somebody
really ought to be paying

685
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:20,694
more attention to them.

686
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:21,861
I mean, look at that.

687
00:39:21,903 --> 00:39:23,488
There's scissors
on the ground.

688
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,115
I mean,
somebody really ought

689
00:39:25,156 --> 00:39:27,701
to be supervising them,
don't you think?

690
00:39:27,742 --> 00:39:29,995
Yeah.

691
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:33,623
Better get back to work.

692
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:35,208
Supervising and all.

693
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,210
I'm Wavey Prowse.

694
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,628
I run the place.

695
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:40,839
They are having
entirely too much fun

696
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,840
aren't they?

697
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:43,508
It's a constant problem

698
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,343
around here.

699
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:47,846
( children laughing
and shouting )

700
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:51,599
Headline:

701
00:39:51,641 --> 00:39:53,643
Bumbling Dad

702
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:57,439
Humiliated at Day Care.

703
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,524
NUTBEEM:
Quoyle!

704
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:03,361
C'mon over, Quoyle!

705
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:04,904
COOK:
Order's up now.
Come and get it.

706
00:40:04,946 --> 00:40:06,906
WAITRESS:
Aye, sir.

707
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,493
Hey.

708
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:14,164
Hmm.

709
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:16,499
You've been to
the harbormaster's.

710
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:18,335
Yeah, boats in,
boats out.

711
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:20,670
Not exactly the
stuff of legends.

712
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:23,256
Sometimes there's a
story behind the story.

713
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:25,091
WAITRESS:
What can I do you for then?

714
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:27,969
Oh, um, I'll have, uh,
what-whatever they're having.

715
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:29,095
What are you having?

716
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:30,597
Squid burger.
It's good.

717
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:32,682
All right, then.
You want some fries with that?

718
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:34,768
Okay.

719
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:36,061
All right, then, be back.

720
00:40:36,102 --> 00:40:37,937
Have you got yourself
a boat yet, Quoyle?

721
00:40:37,979 --> 00:40:39,439
-No.
-You ought to get Alvin Yark

722
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:40,565
to build you one.

723
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:41,775
Or you could buy
Nutbeem's.

724
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:46,112
I built a Chinese junk.

725
00:40:46,154 --> 00:40:47,572
Sailed it up from Brazil.

726
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:50,367
Unfortunately, I missed
Manhattan by a mile or two

727
00:40:50,408 --> 00:40:53,411
and got stranded here when I
shipwrecked by Gaze Island.

728
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:55,038
I've almost finished
my repairs.

729
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,373
I'll be sailing
away soon.

730
00:40:58,166 --> 00:41:00,251
She's ugly, and...

731
00:41:00,293 --> 00:41:02,754
the only thing
I've ever loved.

732
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:06,633
( mock weeping )

733
00:41:06,758 --> 00:41:09,761
Eh, your story tugs
at me bladder.

734
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:20,647
Excuse me.

735
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:23,566
Um, what is it
between those two?

736
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:26,945
First thing:

737
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:29,447
you'll have to understand
about the curse.

738
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:33,451
Jack Buggit's father,
his grandfather

739
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:36,162
his great-grandfather
all died at sea.

740
00:41:36,204 --> 00:41:39,582
Second thing:
Jack is... sensitive.

741
00:41:39,624 --> 00:41:42,252
Especially about the sea.

742
00:41:42,293 --> 00:41:43,461
"Sensitive."

743
00:41:43,503 --> 00:41:46,297
It's what they call
people around here

744
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:48,341
who, um, "know" things.

745
00:41:49,884 --> 00:41:53,138
So, Dennis is
forbidden the sea.

746
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:55,640
But being free

747
00:41:55,682 --> 00:41:57,934
Newfie and 21, he goes, anyway.

748
00:41:57,976 --> 00:41:59,436
What? And that's enough...?

749
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:00,937
Death storm.

750
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:03,940
A massive wave cracks
her steel hull amidships

751
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:06,818
a one-inch crack
from starboard to port.

752
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,321
Men go in the water.
Dennis is lost.

753
00:42:09,362 --> 00:42:12,365
After about a week

754
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:17,620
they come to Jack and tell him
the search is to be called off.

755
00:42:17,662 --> 00:42:20,623
Jack stands like a stone.

756
00:42:20,707 --> 00:42:26,129
Then he turns-- quick,
the way he does-- and says...

757
00:42:26,212 --> 00:42:28,673
"He's alive...

758
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:31,009
and I know where."

759
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:35,472
So, off he goes, out to sea

760
00:42:35,513 --> 00:42:38,016
on his own, in just a skiff

761
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:41,686
and finds Dennis.

762
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:43,897
Can you imagine
the odds?

763
00:42:43,938 --> 00:42:45,690
Finds him.
Finds him.

764
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:49,277
Both arms broken,
99% dead.

765
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:51,655
The boy comes to.

766
00:42:51,696 --> 00:42:54,991
And Jack says to him,
"If you ever step foot

767
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:58,328
in a boat again,
I'll drown you myself."

768
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:02,248
And do you know
what Dennis said?

769
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:03,291
( whispers ):
Say it fast.

770
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:04,626
He said...

771
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:06,378
"All fishing licenses
are spoken for.

772
00:43:06,419 --> 00:43:08,505
I'd appreciate it
if you gave me yours."

773
00:43:08,546 --> 00:43:10,632
Jack looked in his eyes
and they never spoke again.

774
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:12,592
JACK:
Quoyle... you got

775
00:43:12,634 --> 00:43:14,010
the "Shipping News"
written up yet?

776
00:43:14,052 --> 00:43:15,595
Oh, yes.

777
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:17,430
( clears throat )

778
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:22,143
There's nothing here.

779
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:26,523
Boats in, boats out.
What else is there?

780
00:43:26,564 --> 00:43:30,193
If I knew, I'd write it myself.

781
00:43:30,235 --> 00:43:33,822
I took a chance on you, Quoyle.

782
00:43:33,863 --> 00:43:35,991
Don't let me down.

783
00:43:40,286 --> 00:43:41,830
( door closes )

784
00:43:53,216 --> 00:43:55,927
( man shouting indistinctly )

785
00:43:58,471 --> 00:44:01,808
MAN:
Go get the aspirin now!

786
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:03,309
Oh, shut up!

787
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:06,688
I had as much to drink
Last night as you did!

788
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,613
Excuse me.

789
00:44:15,655 --> 00:44:17,324
Do I know you?

790
00:44:17,365 --> 00:44:20,035
I'm a... I-I work
for the local paper.

791
00:44:20,076 --> 00:44:21,911
I do the-the
"Shipping News."

792
00:44:21,953 --> 00:44:23,288
I was just...

793
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:25,415
Is this your boat?

794
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:27,167
That's a boat.

795
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:29,044
This is a Botterjacht.

796
00:44:31,129 --> 00:44:32,797
She was built for Hitler.

797
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:34,299
He was the original owner.

798
00:44:34,341 --> 00:44:35,633
Really?

799
00:44:35,717 --> 00:44:40,055
I-I just wanted to ask you
a-a couple of questions.

800
00:44:40,096 --> 00:44:42,223
The finest Botterjacht
ever built in Holland.

801
00:44:42,265 --> 00:44:44,017
Tell him what happened
in Hurricane Bob.

802
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:47,228
And she's incredibly heavy.
40 tons of solid oak.

803
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:48,480
Tell him!

804
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:56,780
She broke free of her moorings

805
00:44:56,821 --> 00:45:00,158
and pounded six boats--
expensive ones-- to rubble.

806
00:45:03,411 --> 00:45:05,163
Wham!

807
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:11,378
Now tell him who let
our insurance lapse.

808
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:17,300
Wham!

809
00:45:17,342 --> 00:45:20,095
Oh, it took six

810
00:45:20,136 --> 00:45:23,640
very expensive lawyers
to weasel us out of it.

811
00:45:23,682 --> 00:45:25,850
Jesus! An inch
from bankruptcy.

812
00:45:25,892 --> 00:45:28,019
Moral of the story?

813
00:45:28,061 --> 00:45:30,647
When you marry a tour guide

814
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:34,025
confine his authority
to mixing the drinks.

815
00:45:35,527 --> 00:45:38,738
Did I come at a bad time?

816
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:42,534
Yeah. Ten years ago
would've been better.

817
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:46,788
( windshield wipers
squeaking dully )

818
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:50,709
Wife Fires Artillery
on Hitler's Boat.

819
00:45:56,923 --> 00:45:58,216
Hello.

820
00:45:58,258 --> 00:45:59,217
Hi.

821
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:00,260
Hi.

822
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:01,428
You guys need a ride?

823
00:46:01,469 --> 00:46:05,223
Thanks, but, uh,
Herry likes to walk.

824
00:46:05,265 --> 00:46:08,601
Oh. Well, it's a nice day
for a walk.

825
00:46:08,643 --> 00:46:09,978
Mr. Quoyle...

826
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,396
About the other day?

827
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:13,732
I'm sorry we got off
on the wrong foot.

828
00:46:13,773 --> 00:46:15,984
No, that's, that's all right.

829
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:18,028
I-I was way off base.

830
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:21,239
I-I admire anybody
that works with kids.

831
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:24,409
That's the hardest job
in the world, you know?

832
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:26,786
I'm-I'm a journalist, myself.

833
00:46:26,828 --> 00:46:28,079
Really?

834
00:46:28,121 --> 00:46:30,623
Have you seen
our local paper?

835
00:46:30,665 --> 00:46:32,417
Strictly fish wrap.

836
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:35,628
( wipers squeaking louder)

837
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:37,714
What?

838
00:46:40,508 --> 00:46:42,552
I'm the new reporter there.

839
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:46,181
Oy... uh... oh...

840
00:46:46,222 --> 00:46:47,640
no, I'm-I'm sure...

841
00:46:47,766 --> 00:46:49,517
that'll be, uh...

842
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:51,019
( sniffs )

843
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:52,395
Good luck to you.

844
00:46:52,437 --> 00:46:54,189
Oh, thank you
very much.

845
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:56,483
It was nice
to see you again.

846
00:46:56,524 --> 00:46:57,776
Nice to see you.

847
00:46:57,817 --> 00:46:58,860
Bye, Herry.

848
00:46:58,902 --> 00:47:00,236
Bye.

849
00:47:05,784 --> 00:47:07,744
Dennis?

850
00:47:11,164 --> 00:47:14,626
( pounding )

851
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:25,011
Bunny.

852
00:47:25,053 --> 00:47:27,972
W-What are you doing?

853
00:47:28,014 --> 00:47:29,933
She's boring.

854
00:47:29,974 --> 00:47:31,726
Boring.

855
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:41,611
How was Bunny

856
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:43,738
when you picked her up
from day care?

857
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,448
All right.

858
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:47,158
A little snotty.

859
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,084
What's that?

860
00:47:58,378 --> 00:48:01,339
Robert Burns.

861
00:48:04,384 --> 00:48:06,678
Someone gave that to you.

862
00:48:09,848 --> 00:48:12,934
Someone
that you're missing.

863
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:21,276
Six year ago today.

864
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:23,153
Leukemia.

865
00:48:24,988 --> 00:48:27,615
We weren't married

866
00:48:27,657 --> 00:48:30,660
but that's a
technicality.

867
00:48:43,798 --> 00:48:45,967
( keys clacking loudly )

868
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:48,011
( shortwave playing
indistinctly )

869
00:49:02,275 --> 00:49:03,860
That your boat?

870
00:49:03,902 --> 00:49:05,445
Yeah,
I just bought her.

871
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:07,238
One question remains: why?

872
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,573
Well, she's
a speedboat.

873
00:49:08,698 --> 00:49:10,325
JACK:
It's a shit boat.

874
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:12,077
Wallowing, cockeyed bastard.

875
00:49:12,118 --> 00:49:13,578
It'll sink in a bathtub.

876
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,288
Makes you cry
to look at her.

877
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:16,956
Just a coffin, boy.

878
00:49:16,998 --> 00:49:18,416
Let me know when
you're serious.

879
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:19,584
I'll take you
down to see

880
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:21,211
Alvin Yark.

881
00:49:21,252 --> 00:49:23,421
He'll make you up a
sweet little Rodney.

882
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:29,886
You don't have the sense
God gave a doughnut, do you?

883
00:49:29,928 --> 00:49:31,262
I'm going home.

884
00:49:31,304 --> 00:49:34,140
The best you can
do is bury it

885
00:49:34,182 --> 00:49:36,351
some dark night.

886
00:49:39,354 --> 00:49:42,899
What in hell
a name's this?

887
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:45,777
"Hitler's Barge."

888
00:49:45,819 --> 00:49:47,862
Uh, that's, uh,
a vessel in port.

889
00:49:47,904 --> 00:49:49,114
It goes with

890
00:49:49,155 --> 00:49:50,490
the "Shipping News."

891
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:53,284
So, what about
the motorcycle accident?

892
00:49:53,326 --> 00:49:54,744
Oh, I'm still working on that

893
00:49:54,786 --> 00:49:56,454
but I think
this is a better story.

894
00:49:56,496 --> 00:49:57,914
What do you mean?

895
00:49:57,956 --> 00:49:59,124
You didn't do

896
00:49:59,165 --> 00:50:00,875
the one
that Jack wanted you to do?

897
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:02,919
You did one
that he don't know you did?

898
00:50:03,003 --> 00:50:05,797
Well, this is worse
than your boat.

899
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,340
Jack even
sniffs this

900
00:50:07,382 --> 00:50:10,135
he'll cut you up
for lobster bait.

901
00:50:10,176 --> 00:50:13,304
I think I'll run it.

902
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:23,189
...and he crawled off the grass
onto a branch

903
00:50:23,231 --> 00:50:25,317
and he made a cocoon,
which is like a house

904
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:27,027
except it's for
a caterpillar...

905
00:50:27,068 --> 00:50:28,028
Hey, Bunny.

906
00:50:28,069 --> 00:50:29,237
Shh.

907
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:31,448
I'm reading.

908
00:50:33,241 --> 00:50:36,995
He thinks I know how.

909
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:37,829
( kids laughing )

910
00:50:37,871 --> 00:50:39,497
( grunts )

911
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:40,790
Oh, oh... no, no...

912
00:50:40,832 --> 00:50:42,167
( yelling )

913
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:45,170
( kids laughing and screaming )

914
00:50:48,673 --> 00:50:52,510
( groaning )

915
00:50:54,304 --> 00:50:56,681
Go on, get the pig.

916
00:51:01,728 --> 00:51:04,105
( yelling )

917
00:51:04,147 --> 00:51:06,191
( kids laughing )

918
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,363
See you tomorrow.

919
00:51:11,404 --> 00:51:13,531
Oh, bye, Sarah.
Bye, Patrick.

920
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:15,325
PATRICK:
Bye.

921
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:17,202
Hey, can you hold these rods
together for me?

922
00:51:17,243 --> 00:51:19,371
You have to hold them flush
against each other.

923
00:51:19,412 --> 00:51:20,664
Okay.

924
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:23,208
Thanks.

925
00:51:23,249 --> 00:51:25,502
Be careful, honey.

926
00:51:25,543 --> 00:51:26,670
I want to see
if it can fly.

927
00:51:26,753 --> 00:51:28,046
Well, not in the
house, sweetheart.

928
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:29,673
Throw it up in the air,
high as you can

929
00:51:29,714 --> 00:51:31,675
Okay.
and count
till it comes down.

930
00:51:31,716 --> 00:51:32,967
( imitating engine noise )

931
00:51:33,009 --> 00:51:35,679
One, two, three, four, five.

932
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,681
Hey. Have you been
to flight school?

933
00:51:37,722 --> 00:51:39,683
Not really.

934
00:51:39,724 --> 00:51:41,518
No? Oh, my.

935
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:43,979
( Bunny imitating engine )

936
00:51:57,158 --> 00:51:59,577
QUOYLE:
Aunt?

937
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:00,954
Hey, guess what?

938
00:52:00,996 --> 00:52:02,914
Just keep it down.

939
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:04,749
This is my assistant,
Mavis Bangs.

940
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:06,084
-Oh, hello.
-How are you?

941
00:52:06,126 --> 00:52:09,087
Did you read my article
on the Hitler boat?

942
00:52:14,843 --> 00:52:16,845
( scoffing )

943
00:52:16,886 --> 00:52:18,263
What?

944
00:52:18,304 --> 00:52:20,265
Silver and Bennett Melville
were clients of mine.

945
00:52:20,306 --> 00:52:22,434
They pulled anchor last night
without paying a penny

946
00:52:22,475 --> 00:52:23,810
for all the work
we did for them.

947
00:52:23,852 --> 00:52:24,894
The buggers.

948
00:52:24,978 --> 00:52:26,563
Now, you find out
where they're to

949
00:52:26,604 --> 00:52:29,941
we'll give you the Pulitzer.

950
00:52:29,983 --> 00:52:33,278
What, you make juju beads
out of lobster feelers?

951
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,780
Oh, that's pretty
remarkable, missus.

952
00:52:35,822 --> 00:52:37,949
Now, where do
you export these?

953
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:39,784
Haiti?

954
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:42,037
Oh, well...
um, I'll tell you what.

955
00:52:42,078 --> 00:52:43,621
I'll-I'll, uh,
do my best.

956
00:52:43,663 --> 00:52:45,540
I'll try to get you
a bit of ink

957
00:52:45,582 --> 00:52:48,126
in the next edition,
how's that?

958
00:52:52,839 --> 00:52:54,341
Well, you know,
these things

959
00:52:54,382 --> 00:52:56,634
take some time to work out,
you know?

960
00:52:56,676 --> 00:52:57,802
Card?

961
00:52:57,844 --> 00:52:59,512
Hold on.

962
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:04,809
( grunts )

963
00:53:04,851 --> 00:53:07,145
If you're going to Shanghai me
office, Tert

964
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:08,813
you best conceal
the evidence.

965
00:53:08,855 --> 00:53:10,065
Oh, no, Jack...

966
00:53:10,106 --> 00:53:11,107
Nah.

967
00:53:11,149 --> 00:53:13,985
This, uh, Hitler boat...

968
00:53:14,027 --> 00:53:15,904
you assign it?

969
00:53:15,945 --> 00:53:17,238
Nope, sir.

970
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,115
It wasn't my idea.

971
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:22,452
Get me Quoyle.

972
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:31,127
Quoyle... he wants you.

973
00:53:38,968 --> 00:53:41,012
Mr. Buggit, it was what you said
to me in the...

974
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:42,847
Have a seat.

975
00:53:42,889 --> 00:53:45,141
I got four phone calls
Last night

976
00:53:45,183 --> 00:53:47,143
about the Hitler boat--
four.

977
00:53:47,227 --> 00:53:49,020
People enjoyed it.

978
00:53:49,062 --> 00:53:51,356
Mrs. Buggit liked it.

979
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:53,274
Of course,
you don't know

980
00:53:53,316 --> 00:53:56,152
nothing about boats,
but that's entertaining, too.

981
00:53:56,194 --> 00:53:59,572
So, listen here, me old son,
I'm giving you a weekly column.

982
00:53:59,614 --> 00:54:02,701
A story about a different boat
every week.

983
00:54:02,742 --> 00:54:04,160
Human stuff.

984
00:54:04,202 --> 00:54:06,538
Who owned the boat,
who lived and died on her

985
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:07,747
who drowned

986
00:54:07,789 --> 00:54:11,584
who was saved,
who lost his fortune

987
00:54:11,626 --> 00:54:14,212
who had
his heart broke.

988
00:54:14,254 --> 00:54:15,839
You follow?

989
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,590
Tert!

990
00:54:17,632 --> 00:54:19,009
Jack?

991
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:21,094
Order this boy
a new computer.

992
00:54:21,136 --> 00:54:24,556
And buy him a real one,
not one of them Japan clones.

993
00:54:24,597 --> 00:54:25,640
You got that?

994
00:54:25,765 --> 00:54:27,058
Uh-huh.

995
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,143
Oh, Mr. Buggit

996
00:54:28,184 --> 00:54:29,519
I-I-I don't know what to say.

997
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:30,645
Did I not tell you?

998
00:54:30,687 --> 00:54:33,189
My name is Jack.

999
00:54:43,408 --> 00:54:45,410
Jack.

1000
00:54:56,087 --> 00:54:58,214
IBM, please.

1001
00:55:01,176 --> 00:55:04,262
Get back to your
work, Quoyle.

1002
00:55:04,304 --> 00:55:09,184
I... B... M.

1003
00:55:12,354 --> 00:55:15,649
( stifled snickers )

1004
00:55:17,651 --> 00:55:23,615
Lumbering Idiot Stuns Crowd...
for a Change.

1005
00:55:34,793 --> 00:55:37,003
WAVEY:
Herry Prowse!

1006
00:55:37,045 --> 00:55:39,297
Look how well

1007
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:40,590
your kite is doing.

1008
00:55:40,632 --> 00:55:43,593
Are you making it dance
with your thoughts?

1009
00:55:43,677 --> 00:55:48,473
Your kite is doing so much
better than Mr. Quoyle's.

1010
00:55:50,016 --> 00:55:52,310
( kids laughing )

1011
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,236
Do you think
Bunny's strange--

1012
00:56:01,277 --> 00:56:03,488
I mean, mentally?

1013
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:06,574
The skinny ghost
with the white dog?

1014
00:56:06,616 --> 00:56:08,576
She told you about that?

1015
00:56:08,618 --> 00:56:10,412
Maybe she's sensitive.

1016
00:56:10,453 --> 00:56:13,248
The way some folks are
around here.

1017
00:56:13,289 --> 00:56:15,625
And what about
the necklaces?

1018
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:18,878
Do you know how many
of those she makes?

1019
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,631
I mean... and I found her

1020
00:56:21,673 --> 00:56:25,135
bashing her baby doll's
brains out with a hammer.

1021
00:56:25,218 --> 00:56:27,095
A baby doll
doesn't have brains.

1022
00:56:27,137 --> 00:56:28,430
It's a toy.

1023
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:31,933
Do you know she's...

1024
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:34,102
saving a room for her mother?

1025
00:56:34,144 --> 00:56:35,770
Did she tell you that?

1026
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:37,314
( softly ):
Yeah.

1027
00:56:37,397 --> 00:56:39,107
Is she strange, that's all?

1028
00:56:39,149 --> 00:56:41,109
Is she okay?
If-if you had to take a guess.

1029
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:47,365
That little girl's
the only friend my son ever had.

1030
00:56:47,407 --> 00:56:49,743
So she's strange, you bet.

1031
00:56:49,784 --> 00:56:51,703
BUNNY:
It crashed!

1032
00:56:54,247 --> 00:56:58,376
( kids laughing )

1033
00:57:00,754 --> 00:57:02,213
All right.

1034
00:57:02,255 --> 00:57:04,174
There you go.

1035
00:57:08,803 --> 00:57:11,348
( seagulls calling )

1036
00:57:15,518 --> 00:57:17,354
( labored breathing )

1037
00:57:25,236 --> 00:57:28,948
Do you know
how he died?

1038
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:31,034
My husband?

1039
00:57:36,122 --> 00:57:40,168
It was a calm night
when Herold took the boat out.

1040
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:45,006
There was no sign
of any storm.

1041
00:57:45,048 --> 00:57:47,759
Storms can be sudden
around here.

1042
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:51,221
He wasn't the only one
whose boat went down.

1043
00:57:55,850 --> 00:57:59,062
It was four years ago...

1044
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:01,106
and it's yesterday.

1045
00:58:15,662 --> 00:58:16,913
HERRY:
Look how high
we're up.

1046
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:18,331
BUNNY:
Uh-huh.

1047
00:58:18,373 --> 00:58:21,334
Beat you to
the car.

1048
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:23,378
( kids laughing )

1049
00:58:25,046 --> 00:58:26,840
Did I blow it

1050
00:58:26,881 --> 00:58:28,633
or can you still
be my friend?

1051
00:58:30,677 --> 00:58:35,056
Your friend? Sure.

1052
00:58:59,331 --> 00:59:01,207
( Bunny humming )

1053
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:09,799
Is this yours?

1054
00:59:10,884 --> 00:59:14,095
( yawning ):
The ghost brought it.

1055
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:17,432
Then he ran away.

1056
00:59:17,474 --> 00:59:19,934
The skinny ghost
with the white dog?

1057
00:59:19,976 --> 00:59:23,396
Don't say I dreamt it.

1058
00:59:30,862 --> 00:59:32,113
( sighs )

1059
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:37,869
BILLY:
Ah, you're getting
the hang of it.

1060
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:39,871
Now, coax her a wee bit
to starboard.

1061
00:59:39,913 --> 00:59:43,375
Attaboy. You're a Quoyle--
there's seawater in your veins.

1062
00:59:43,416 --> 00:59:45,001
( groaning )

1063
00:59:45,043 --> 00:59:48,004
How are things
with your girl?

1064
00:59:48,046 --> 00:59:52,217
Oh, Bunny's just still
adjusting, I think.

1065
00:59:52,258 --> 00:59:55,261
Oh, I was talking
about Wavey Prowse.

1066
00:59:55,261 --> 00:59:56,262
Sorry... sorry!

1067
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:57,263
Whoa!

1068
00:59:57,347 --> 00:59:59,182
-Jesus!
-Sorry.

1069
00:59:59,224 --> 01:00:02,519
I... Wavey and I
are just friends.

1070
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:06,022
Fine. Don't have
to drown me over it.

1071
01:00:14,823 --> 01:00:17,826
This is where
I grew up.

1072
01:00:17,867 --> 01:00:19,786
That's my poor old
father there.

1073
01:00:25,291 --> 01:00:27,293
And that's where
your house stood.

1074
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:39,848
Before they dragged it
across the ice.

1075
01:00:39,889 --> 01:00:40,932
Yes, sir.

1076
01:00:40,974 --> 01:00:44,060
Before they was driven away.

1077
01:00:46,313 --> 01:00:47,939
Driven away by what?

1078
01:00:50,984 --> 01:00:52,819
You never knew?

1079
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:54,612
Ah, well.

1080
01:00:54,654 --> 01:00:56,239
It's neither
here nor there, right?

1081
01:00:56,364 --> 01:00:58,408
The point is, they made
a new place for theirselves.

1082
01:00:58,450 --> 01:00:59,701
No, by what?
Driven away by what?

1083
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:02,912
Oh, that's old stuff, boy.

1084
01:01:02,954 --> 01:01:04,289
It's in my blood.

1085
01:01:04,331 --> 01:01:06,833
You ought to be
able to tell me.

1086
01:01:09,085 --> 01:01:13,298
Well, they come to Gaze Island
centuries ago, they did.

1087
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:15,467
The old Quoyles was rackers.

1088
01:01:15,508 --> 01:01:18,553
They were, they were pirates,
sort of like.

1089
01:01:18,595 --> 01:01:19,596
You see them cairns?

1090
01:01:21,389 --> 01:01:23,600
Fires used to burn in them

1091
01:01:23,642 --> 01:01:27,437
to guide the ships at sea,
like lighthouses.

1092
01:01:27,479 --> 01:01:30,523
Now, the Quoyles
would move the fires

1093
01:01:30,565 --> 01:01:31,733
to fool the ships.

1094
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,652
They'd lure them
into the rocks

1095
01:01:33,693 --> 01:01:35,862
so the Quoyles could grab
their loot.

1096
01:01:35,904 --> 01:01:38,448
Oh, they was a savage lot,
the old Quoyles.

1097
01:01:38,531 --> 01:01:43,244
Then they went too far one day,
they... nailed a man to a tree

1098
01:01:43,328 --> 01:01:45,497
and they cut
off his nose

1099
01:01:45,538 --> 01:01:48,416
to draw the nippers
and the flies

1100
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:50,418
that-that ate him alive.

1101
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:55,173
And that's when the Quoyles was
given their walking papers.

1102
01:01:55,173 --> 01:01:57,676
Jesus.

1103
01:01:57,717 --> 01:01:59,511
Now, there's still an old Quoyle

1104
01:01:59,552 --> 01:02:01,721
down in one of these coves
somewhere.

1105
01:02:01,763 --> 01:02:05,600
They say he slept with his wife
after she was dead.

1106
01:02:05,642 --> 01:02:09,396
Anything else I should know?

1107
01:02:11,356 --> 01:02:14,025
That about covers it.

1108
01:02:16,611 --> 01:02:18,822
( buoy bell ringing )

1109
01:02:21,741 --> 01:02:26,329
BILLY:
[m] When the knitting pins,
you is abreast [m]

1110
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:30,834
[m] Hold the tiller
to the west... [m]

1111
01:02:30,875 --> 01:02:36,214
[m] Behind the pins
you must steer... [m]

1112
01:02:36,297 --> 01:02:39,342
[m] Till the old man's shoe...
does appear. [m]

1113
01:02:39,384 --> 01:02:41,928
( Celtic drums fade up )

1114
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:44,014
( woman screaming )

1115
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:51,438
( men yelling )

1116
01:02:58,737 --> 01:03:01,906
( men shouting indistinctly )

1117
01:03:07,412 --> 01:03:09,456
MAN:
Pull, pull!

1118
01:03:10,915 --> 01:03:12,792
( shouting angrily )

1119
01:03:18,256 --> 01:03:20,216
( drums stop )

1120
01:03:20,258 --> 01:03:22,260
( gasps )

1121
01:03:31,478 --> 01:03:33,021
AGNIS:
Show me that necklace.

1122
01:03:33,063 --> 01:03:34,856
See, if you make
the loops bigger

1123
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:36,483
you don't have
to make so many.

1124
01:03:36,524 --> 01:03:37,734
BUNNY:
Okay.

1125
01:03:37,776 --> 01:03:40,362
Good morning.

1126
01:03:42,906 --> 01:03:45,784
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1127
01:03:52,165 --> 01:03:53,458
Where's that chair from?

1128
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,086
Excuse me?

1129
01:03:56,127 --> 01:03:57,587
The chair
that you're sitting in.

1130
01:03:57,671 --> 01:03:59,255
Where's it from;
where'd you get it?

1131
01:03:59,339 --> 01:04:00,840
It's not from
around here, right?

1132
01:04:00,882 --> 01:04:04,427
It's foreign,
it's exotic.

1133
01:04:04,469 --> 01:04:06,930
I don't want pirate's loot
in this home.

1134
01:04:07,013 --> 01:04:10,809
Billy Pretty told me
all about it.

1135
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:15,063
It's a good thing
somebody finally did.

1136
01:04:15,105 --> 01:04:18,316
I don't believe in dwelling
in the past.

1137
01:04:18,316 --> 01:04:20,986
No? Then what
are we doing here?

1138
01:04:21,027 --> 01:04:23,196
Making a future.

1139
01:04:28,994 --> 01:04:29,953
Well, well, well

1140
01:04:29,995 --> 01:04:32,497
if it ain't the second coming
of the Quoyles.

1141
01:04:32,539 --> 01:04:34,499
Taking a long
and hearty meal break

1142
01:04:34,541 --> 01:04:36,042
I can't help but noticing.

1143
01:04:36,084 --> 01:04:38,336
Hope you've got a good idea
for your next story, Quoyle.

1144
01:04:38,378 --> 01:04:39,337
I'd hate for Jack to think

1145
01:04:39,379 --> 01:04:41,131
that it was just
beginner's luck.

1146
01:04:41,172 --> 01:04:42,590
Let the man digest, Tert.

1147
01:04:42,632 --> 01:04:44,759
Mind you,
if I was the esteemed author

1148
01:04:44,801 --> 01:04:46,428
of the "Shipping News" column

1149
01:04:46,469 --> 01:04:48,888
I'd pick up
the McGonigle oil field story.

1150
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:51,099
Petro-dollars;
a golden flood of jobs.

1151
01:04:51,141 --> 01:04:52,642
You write a story
about that

1152
01:04:52,684 --> 01:04:55,103
I'll put it right there
on the front page.

1153
01:04:55,145 --> 01:04:56,980
Thank you
for stopping by, Tert.

1154
01:04:57,022 --> 01:04:59,232
Yeah, thanks, Tert.

1155
01:05:01,609 --> 01:05:03,236
Aw, gee...

1156
01:05:03,361 --> 01:05:05,947
What was that
all about?

1157
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:09,826
Oh, uh, he owns Mobil Oil.

1158
01:05:09,868 --> 01:05:12,329
Ten shares.

1159
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,623
WAVEY:
What about your column?

1160
01:05:15,665 --> 01:05:18,168
What about it?

1161
01:05:18,251 --> 01:05:20,170
You said you'd
read it to me.

1162
01:05:20,211 --> 01:05:22,547
Yeah, I will,
once the game is done.

1163
01:05:22,547 --> 01:05:26,009
( horn blowing )

1164
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:33,308
"There's a 1904 photo hung
in the Killick-Claw library...

1165
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:36,728
"eight schooners heading out
to the fishing grounds

1166
01:05:36,728 --> 01:05:39,356
"their sails are white
and beautiful.

1167
01:05:39,397 --> 01:05:42,192
"But nowadays you're just
as likely to see

1168
01:05:42,233 --> 01:05:44,569
"a big black shape
of an oil tanker

1169
01:05:44,569 --> 01:05:46,780
"Like the ruptured Golden Goose.

01:05:46,821 --> 01:05:49,491
"Last week it leaked
14,000 tons of crude

01:05:49,532 --> 01:05:52,911
"onto the seabirds, fish
and boats at Cape Despot.

1172
01:05:52,952 --> 01:05:55,538
"There will be more
and more tankers.

1173
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:59,250
"They will get old and corroded
and their tanks will split.

1174
01:05:59,292 --> 01:06:04,089
"And there will be less fish,
and less fishermen.

1175
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:07,801
"Nobody hangs a picture
of an oil tanker

1176
01:06:07,842 --> 01:06:10,095
on their wall, do they?"

1177
01:06:12,806 --> 01:06:15,141
What do you think?

1178
01:06:15,183 --> 01:06:19,771
I think when Tert Card sees it,
he'll stay up nights

1179
01:06:19,813 --> 01:06:23,316
thinking of cheap shots
to pay you back.

1180
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:25,819
I think he won't stop
until you're fired.

1181
01:06:28,822 --> 01:06:34,911
I think I haven't been so proud
of a friend...

1182
01:06:34,953 --> 01:06:37,539
since I don't know when.

1183
01:06:41,668 --> 01:06:43,670
( switch clicks )

1184
01:06:43,712 --> 01:06:46,131
( water bubbling )

1185
01:06:53,096 --> 01:06:54,222
( door squeaking )

1186
01:06:54,306 --> 01:06:55,640
Uh, what do you think?

1187
01:06:55,682 --> 01:06:57,642
Pretty impressive, huh?

1188
01:06:57,684 --> 01:07:00,687
Like I said, nobody
hangs one of those.

1189
01:07:00,729 --> 01:07:03,023
Well... your column's
front page stuff.

1190
01:07:03,064 --> 01:07:07,569
Only now it's more
a caption, is all.

1191
01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:10,238
"More than 3,000 tankers
proudly ride...

1192
01:07:10,363 --> 01:07:11,614
the world's seas."

1193
01:07:11,656 --> 01:07:13,992
"Even the biggest
take advantage

1194
01:07:14,034 --> 01:07:17,412
of Newfoundland's deep water
ports and refineries."

1195
01:07:17,454 --> 01:07:20,957
Spelled it all perfect
so as not to embarrass you.

1196
01:07:20,999 --> 01:07:23,001
"Oil and Newfoundland
go together

1197
01:07:23,043 --> 01:07:24,502
"like ham and eggs

1198
01:07:24,502 --> 01:07:28,256
and like ham and eggs, they'll
nourish us in the coming years."

1199
01:07:28,381 --> 01:07:32,218
Even put
your name on it.

1200
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:37,057
"Let's all hang a picture
of an oil tanker on our wall."

1201
01:07:37,098 --> 01:07:40,518
Man of your principles...

1202
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:45,523
I understand the only honorable
course is resignation.

1203
01:07:45,523 --> 01:07:46,858
( crumples paper)

1204
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:49,402
And if you're off
to see Jack Buggit

1205
01:07:49,444 --> 01:07:51,488
you're going
to have to swim.

1206
01:07:51,529 --> 01:07:54,282
For I runs the Gammy Bird,
every inch of it--

1207
01:07:54,366 --> 01:07:55,909
which he'd have
to do without me.

1208
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:58,370
And if you think he's going
to choose you over fishing

1209
01:07:58,411 --> 01:08:01,915
then you're dumber
than a doughnut.

1210
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:05,126
If that's possible.

1211
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:32,570
Jack?

1212
01:08:32,612 --> 01:08:34,030
For Christ
sakes, Quoyle

1213
01:08:34,072 --> 01:08:36,199
cut your motor!

1214
01:08:49,004 --> 01:08:52,549
All right,
what's the emergency?

1215
01:08:52,590 --> 01:08:54,426
Can't it wait
till I'm done fishing?

1216
01:08:54,467 --> 01:08:55,593
It's about my column.

1217
01:08:55,635 --> 01:09:00,015
Card, he printed it
not the way I wrote it.

1218
01:09:00,056 --> 01:09:01,016
Well, so?

1219
01:09:01,057 --> 01:09:04,769
You disapprove
how Card runs my newspaper

1220
01:09:04,811 --> 01:09:09,566
enough to lose your job?

1221
01:09:09,607 --> 01:09:12,110
Yes or no?

1222
01:09:12,152 --> 01:09:14,779
Yes.

1223
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:20,035
( shortwave radio
playing quietly )

1224
01:09:30,003 --> 01:09:31,504
( door opens )

1225
01:09:35,633 --> 01:09:39,596
So, this is what
Jack and I think:

1226
01:09:39,638 --> 01:09:43,058
we want to run Quoyle's
wrong-headed oil spills story

1227
01:09:43,099 --> 01:09:45,268
because controversy sells papers

1228
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:47,520
and papers sells ads.

1229
01:09:51,149 --> 01:09:53,985
But the oil tanker picture
stays.

1230
01:09:57,614 --> 01:09:59,991
( groans )

1231
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,871
( laughter)

1232
01:10:04,913 --> 01:10:06,998
You should have seen
Tert's face.

1233
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,124
Yeah?

1234
01:10:08,166 --> 01:10:09,709
Oh, it was
a beautiful thing.

1235
01:10:09,751 --> 01:10:11,503
That's all right,
I've seen it.

1236
01:10:11,544 --> 01:10:12,545
( chuckles )

1237
01:10:14,714 --> 01:10:17,467
-Oh, it's great.
-Mm-hmm.

1238
01:10:19,761 --> 01:10:21,179
Let's see
what the special is.

1239
01:10:29,521 --> 01:10:32,816
How do you feel
about ordering to go?

1240
01:10:36,528 --> 01:10:38,154
You ever had that
before?

1241
01:10:38,196 --> 01:10:40,365
No, what is it?

1242
01:10:40,365 --> 01:10:43,159
Seal-flipper pie.

1243
01:10:43,201 --> 01:10:45,120
Yeah, it's made
from, like

1244
01:10:45,161 --> 01:10:47,998
the knuckle part
of the flipper.

1245
01:10:48,039 --> 01:10:49,791
The slimy cartilage part.

1246
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:53,753
Yeah, it's good, though.

1247
01:10:53,795 --> 01:10:55,505
I mean, it's
a good choice

1248
01:10:55,547 --> 01:10:57,590
if you like
that sort of thing.

1249
01:10:57,632 --> 01:11:00,635
I... you know,
I'm really not
all that hungry.

1250
01:11:00,677 --> 01:11:02,846
I just wanted, you know,
to come and sit.

1251
01:11:02,887 --> 01:11:05,223
I had a big lunch today.

1252
01:11:05,265 --> 01:11:06,850
Yeah.

1253
01:11:06,891 --> 01:11:09,227
They say you're not
a real Newfoundlander

1254
01:11:09,269 --> 01:11:11,771
till you've had a piece
of seal-flipper pie.

1255
01:11:15,317 --> 01:11:16,735
That's what they say?

1256
01:11:16,776 --> 01:11:18,069
Yeah, that's right.

1257
01:11:26,828 --> 01:11:30,165
Mmm, good.
That's surprising.

1258
01:11:30,206 --> 01:11:33,168
( laughs ):
I never eat it, myself.

1259
01:11:33,209 --> 01:11:35,420
You never eat this?

1260
01:11:35,462 --> 01:11:38,840
This is horrible.

1261
01:11:38,882 --> 01:11:42,010
Here, I got you some
real food-- look.

1262
01:11:42,052 --> 01:11:44,012
( both laughing )

1263
01:11:47,349 --> 01:11:48,975
( lilting melody playing )

1264
01:12:18,296 --> 01:12:19,839
( engine revs )

1265
01:12:22,759 --> 01:12:24,594
( gasps )

1266
01:12:29,265 --> 01:12:31,267
( grunting and gasping )

1267
01:12:36,898 --> 01:12:39,651
( gasping )

1268
01:12:39,651 --> 01:12:42,112
( motor clanks dully )

1269
01:12:42,153 --> 01:12:43,196
( yells in pain )

1270
01:12:58,253 --> 01:13:00,046
( gasping )

1271
01:13:19,232 --> 01:13:22,819
( gasping )

1272
01:13:41,087 --> 01:13:44,007
( melancholy music playing )

1273
01:14:02,942 --> 01:14:05,904
( music continues )

1274
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:11,201
( buoy bell clangs
in distance )

1275
01:14:11,242 --> 01:14:13,787
( motor chugging )

1276
01:14:23,421 --> 01:14:25,423
( motor throttles back )

1277
01:14:29,761 --> 01:14:31,429
JACK:
Christ.

1278
01:14:31,429 --> 01:14:33,765
I knew somebody
was out here.

1279
01:14:33,765 --> 01:14:35,141
( groans )

1280
01:14:43,316 --> 01:14:44,901
Oh, for Christ's sake.

1281
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:53,451
( shuddering )

1282
01:15:04,796 --> 01:15:08,174
He's still burning off
the fever.

1283
01:15:22,772 --> 01:15:24,649
Any feeling yet?

1284
01:15:26,901 --> 01:15:28,903
Little tingles.

1285
01:15:31,323 --> 01:15:32,949
You're lucky.

1286
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:33,950
I'm fine.

1287
01:15:33,992 --> 01:15:37,704
I'll be ready to get
right back in that water

1288
01:15:37,746 --> 01:15:40,749
in another 20, 30 years.

1289
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:44,085
Do you know how close
you were to dying?

1290
01:15:49,507 --> 01:15:52,927
I'll get my uncle, Alvin Yark,
to build you a proper boat

1291
01:15:52,969 --> 01:15:54,971
and learn how to use it, okay?

1292
01:15:55,013 --> 01:15:58,141
Okay.

1293
01:15:58,183 --> 01:16:00,185
Good.

1294
01:16:14,449 --> 01:16:16,743
MAVIS:
Were the eyes open or closed?

1295
01:16:16,785 --> 01:16:18,036
I don't know.

1296
01:16:18,036 --> 01:16:20,830
Just said it was
an disembodied head.

1297
01:16:20,872 --> 01:16:21,873
What'd the police have

1298
01:16:21,915 --> 01:16:23,208
to say about it?

1299
01:16:23,208 --> 01:16:24,376
Still working on it.

1300
01:16:24,417 --> 01:16:27,921
A little late to return the head
to its owner, though.

1301
01:16:27,962 --> 01:16:30,006
( snorts )

1302
01:16:30,048 --> 01:16:33,677
Hello, nephew.

1303
01:16:33,718 --> 01:16:35,011
Police bulletin:

1304
01:16:35,053 --> 01:16:38,682
"Mrs. Silver Melville
was arrested early today

1305
01:16:38,723 --> 01:16:41,893
"in Lanai, Hawaii,
for the murder of her husband

1306
01:16:41,893 --> 01:16:46,523
socialite and raconteur
Mr. Bayonet Melville."

1307
01:16:46,564 --> 01:16:49,567
'He pushed me once too often,'
Mrs. Melville confessed

1308
01:16:49,609 --> 01:16:51,361
'so I finally pushed back."'

1309
01:16:51,403 --> 01:16:53,822
Good for you, my dear.

1310
01:16:58,243 --> 01:17:00,578
Well, he probably
deserved it.

1311
01:17:12,173 --> 01:17:14,551
-Hey.
-Hey.

1312
01:17:14,592 --> 01:17:15,927
Don't get your hopes up.

1313
01:17:15,969 --> 01:17:18,346
You're the first man
who ever cooked for me.

1314
01:17:18,388 --> 01:17:19,639
You got a lot
of leeway.

1315
01:17:19,681 --> 01:17:21,099
How are they?

1316
01:17:21,141 --> 01:17:24,936
They're both asleep
in Bunny's bed.

1317
01:17:24,978 --> 01:17:28,023
Should we trust them?

1318
01:17:28,064 --> 01:17:30,150
-( Wavey laughing )
-I can do this.
You just don't think...

1319
01:17:30,191 --> 01:17:31,609
Oh, no.

1320
01:17:31,609 --> 01:17:34,029
No, I know. Here...

1321
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:36,323
let me do that,
all right?

1322
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:40,368
There you go.

1323
01:17:43,663 --> 01:17:45,623
-Can you feel that...
-Yeah.

1324
01:17:45,623 --> 01:17:47,250
through your bandage?

1325
01:18:09,981 --> 01:18:12,442
What?

1326
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,908
Your husband, he never...

1327
01:18:19,949 --> 01:18:21,826
he never cooked you a meal?

1328
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:26,164
Why are we talking
about my husband?

1329
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:31,169
Because I understand.

1330
01:18:31,211 --> 01:18:35,382
You said "It's four years
ago and it's yesterday."

1331
01:18:35,423 --> 01:18:37,467
( heavy sigh )

1332
01:18:37,509 --> 01:18:40,929
I understand that.

1333
01:18:40,971 --> 01:18:44,933
My husband's not who
we're talking about, right?

1334
01:18:56,277 --> 01:18:57,487
I'll go get Herry.

1335
01:18:57,529 --> 01:19:00,407
He wouldn't like
waking up in a strange bed.

1336
01:19:14,004 --> 01:19:15,630
( dog barks )

1337
01:19:24,681 --> 01:19:27,058
( mysterious theme playing )

1338
01:19:38,028 --> 01:19:41,239
( wind whistling eerily )

1339
01:19:41,364 --> 01:19:44,909
( rattling and creaking )

1340
01:19:44,951 --> 01:19:47,037
( mysterious theme continues )

1341
01:20:03,178 --> 01:20:04,387
-Hey!
-Huh?!

1342
01:20:04,429 --> 01:20:05,764
Who are you?

1343
01:20:05,764 --> 01:20:07,182
( barking )

1344
01:20:07,223 --> 01:20:08,850
( growling )

1345
01:20:08,892 --> 01:20:09,851
( barking )

1346
01:20:09,893 --> 01:20:11,186
( muttering )

1347
01:20:11,227 --> 01:20:13,980
I tied magic in these knots

1348
01:20:14,022 --> 01:20:16,775
to protect you
from the house.

1349
01:20:16,816 --> 01:20:18,526
No good ever come
from the old place.

1350
01:20:18,568 --> 01:20:21,237
Never, never... never.

1351
01:20:21,321 --> 01:20:25,241
You... you have no...

1352
01:20:25,325 --> 01:20:27,952
business in the
Quoyle house.

1353
01:20:27,994 --> 01:20:30,121
I get you
out of there.

1354
01:20:30,163 --> 01:20:31,665
But I am a Quoyle.

1355
01:20:31,706 --> 01:20:34,000
A Quoyle?!

1356
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:37,337
I was a Quoyle
before you was anything.

1357
01:20:37,379 --> 01:20:39,172
( clearing throat )

1358
01:20:39,214 --> 01:20:41,007
Leave the house.

1359
01:20:42,968 --> 01:20:46,221
Tell, uh...
Agnis hello from...

1360
01:20:46,262 --> 01:20:48,807
Cousin Nolan.

1361
01:20:48,848 --> 01:20:50,684
( muttering )

1362
01:20:50,725 --> 01:20:53,979
You know why
Agnis come back?

1363
01:20:53,979 --> 01:20:58,900
To show she ain't afraid
of the place no more.

1364
01:20:58,942 --> 01:21:03,029
'Cause I know what she's done.
I know.

1365
01:21:03,071 --> 01:21:05,699
She got rid of the baby
she was carrying.

1366
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:08,159
What could she do? What?

1367
01:21:08,201 --> 01:21:12,497
She was only 12

1368
01:21:12,539 --> 01:21:18,378
and it was her own brother
that done it to her.

1369
01:21:25,885 --> 01:21:27,178
( girl laughing )

1370
01:21:32,767 --> 01:21:34,102
( laughs )

1371
01:21:41,318 --> 01:21:42,777
( laughs )

1372
01:21:48,116 --> 01:21:50,952
No...

1373
01:21:50,994 --> 01:21:53,371
No! No! No!

1374
01:21:53,413 --> 01:21:54,998
Please! No!

1375
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,167
No! Please!

1376
01:21:57,208 --> 01:21:58,585
( shrieks )

1377
01:22:11,056 --> 01:22:12,390
( kettle whistles )

1378
01:22:22,233 --> 01:22:24,569
Does that belong
to you?

1379
01:22:24,611 --> 01:22:26,571
Sorry.

1380
01:22:30,075 --> 01:22:31,826
There's still hot water
in the kettle

1381
01:22:31,868 --> 01:22:33,703
if you want some tea.

1382
01:22:36,164 --> 01:22:39,584
I've started looking for a place
for me and Bunny.

1383
01:22:39,584 --> 01:22:42,796
You sure you're going
to be okay at your shop?

1384
01:22:42,837 --> 01:22:45,090
I said I would,
didn't I?

1385
01:22:54,766 --> 01:22:56,518
I think
Silver Melville was right

1386
01:22:56,559 --> 01:22:58,269
to chop her husband's head off.

1387
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:03,525
He probably deserved it.

1388
01:23:11,574 --> 01:23:15,328
I think more women
should do what she did.

1389
01:23:18,331 --> 01:23:21,584
Maybe some should have done it
to their own brother...

1390
01:23:26,131 --> 01:23:28,091
my father.

1391
01:23:31,052 --> 01:23:34,097
Cousin Nolan dropped by
last night.

1392
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:53,867
( dishes clatter)

1393
01:24:06,838 --> 01:24:11,426
I always thought if anyone
knew, I'd be turned to stone.

1394
01:24:11,468 --> 01:24:14,846
Shit!

1395
01:24:31,321 --> 01:24:32,739
Here.

1396
01:24:36,326 --> 01:24:38,203
Tea's a good drink.

1397
01:24:38,328 --> 01:24:40,538
It'll keep you going.

1398
01:24:49,714 --> 01:24:52,676
When someone hurts you
that much...

1399
01:24:52,717 --> 01:24:55,053
how do you...?

1400
01:24:58,306 --> 01:25:00,350
Does it ever go away?

1401
01:25:03,728 --> 01:25:05,563
Is it possible?

1402
01:25:17,742 --> 01:25:19,828
( sits mug on table )

1403
01:25:38,596 --> 01:25:41,850
AGNIS:
Her name was Irene.

1404
01:25:41,891 --> 01:25:43,852
The love of my life.

1405
01:25:53,236 --> 01:25:55,196
You look happy.

1406
01:25:58,241 --> 01:26:01,536
So, yeah, it is possible.

1407
01:26:05,999 --> 01:26:09,294
QUOYLE:
Agnis tells me we got to move
for the winter.

1408
01:26:10,337 --> 01:26:12,589
It'll be a three-hour drive
from here to the Point.

1409
01:26:12,631 --> 01:26:13,715
All the ice...

1410
01:26:13,757 --> 01:26:16,343
Me and Bunny,
we're going to have to find

1411
01:26:16,384 --> 01:26:17,927
a room in town somewhere.

1412
01:26:17,969 --> 01:26:20,764
I'll have the usual,
please, Annie. Thank you.

1413
01:26:25,810 --> 01:26:28,813
Well, if it's a place
to stay you need

1414
01:26:28,855 --> 01:26:30,774
you can have
my trailer.

1415
01:26:30,815 --> 01:26:31,941
Timing's perfect.

1416
01:26:31,983 --> 01:26:33,652
What are you talking about?

1417
01:26:33,652 --> 01:26:35,111
My boat's ready.

1418
01:26:35,153 --> 01:26:37,155
If I stay here
any longer

1419
01:26:37,197 --> 01:26:38,657
I might begin
to like the place.

1420
01:26:38,657 --> 01:26:41,159
I'm throwing myself
a farewell party on Saturday.

1421
01:26:41,201 --> 01:26:43,662
Departure to
follow Sunday.

1422
01:26:43,703 --> 01:26:46,206
The rootless traitor.

1423
01:26:46,331 --> 01:26:48,667
Regrets soon after,
no doubt.

1424
01:26:56,633 --> 01:26:59,219
( boisterous din )

1425
01:26:59,344 --> 01:27:01,346
( bottles breaking )

1426
01:27:01,388 --> 01:27:03,682
( laughter)

1427
01:27:03,682 --> 01:27:04,808
Quoyle of the North!

1428
01:27:07,727 --> 01:27:09,145
Quoyle of the North.

1429
01:27:09,187 --> 01:27:11,231
Have you and Wavey
done the dirty yet?

1430
01:27:11,356 --> 01:27:17,696
( slurred ):
Shh! She's the grieving widow.

1431
01:27:17,737 --> 01:27:19,823
Grieving for
Herold Prowse.

1432
01:27:19,864 --> 01:27:21,658
Oh, that's a good one.

1433
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:23,451
Let me tell you
something

1434
01:27:23,493 --> 01:27:25,203
about old Herold Prowse.

1435
01:27:25,245 --> 01:27:27,497
It's like a party game
in town--

1436
01:27:27,539 --> 01:27:28,873
to look at babies

1437
01:27:28,873 --> 01:27:31,501
and see if they look
like Herold.

1438
01:27:33,628 --> 01:27:34,629
Hey...

1439
01:27:34,671 --> 01:27:35,672
Hey!

1440
01:27:38,133 --> 01:27:39,134
Everyone!

1441
01:27:39,175 --> 01:27:42,053
To Nutbeem!

1442
01:27:42,095 --> 01:27:44,055
ALL:
To Nutbeem!

1443
01:27:44,055 --> 01:27:46,099
We all loves

1444
01:27:46,141 --> 01:27:48,101
our fucking Nutbeem, huh?!

1445
01:27:48,143 --> 01:27:49,519
( all cheer)

1446
01:27:49,561 --> 01:27:51,646
Lets us keep him here then!

1447
01:27:51,688 --> 01:27:52,689
( all cheer)

1448
01:27:52,731 --> 01:27:56,651
Got your chainsaw,
Neddie?

1449
01:27:56,693 --> 01:27:58,528
( all cheer)

1450
01:27:58,570 --> 01:28:00,905
( chainsaw buzzes )

1451
01:28:00,905 --> 01:28:02,115
ALL:
Nutbeem!

1452
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:15,337
Hoh-oh-oh!

1453
01:28:15,378 --> 01:28:16,880
( chainsaw buzzing )

1454
01:28:28,308 --> 01:28:31,519
( blows echoing )

1455
01:28:31,561 --> 01:28:33,563
( woman screaming )

1456
01:28:42,614 --> 01:28:45,075
( grunting )

1457
01:28:51,623 --> 01:28:54,376
( bird hooting )

1458
01:28:54,417 --> 01:28:57,587
( accordion playing
in distance )

1459
01:28:57,629 --> 01:28:59,047
( grunts )

1460
01:29:06,137 --> 01:29:09,057
( accordion grows louder )

1461
01:29:19,067 --> 01:29:22,070
( pounding )

1462
01:29:28,493 --> 01:29:29,828
What's wrong?

1463
01:29:29,869 --> 01:29:33,540
( slurring ):
I'm a Quoyle.

1464
01:29:33,581 --> 01:29:35,041
I'm one of the Quoyles

1465
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:38,628
pirates and looters
and murderers.

1466
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:43,591
My father raped
his little sister

1467
01:29:43,633 --> 01:29:45,802
and then he taught me
how to swim.

1468
01:29:49,639 --> 01:29:51,016
Stop that.

1469
01:29:51,016 --> 01:29:53,226
Jesus, you smell
like a brewery.

1470
01:29:53,268 --> 01:29:54,311
Stop it.

1471
01:29:56,438 --> 01:29:57,981
Go on, Herry. Go on.

1472
01:29:58,023 --> 01:30:00,984
( whimpering )

1473
01:30:01,026 --> 01:30:02,861
Stop it!

1474
01:30:06,865 --> 01:30:08,700
Herry.

1475
01:30:11,161 --> 01:30:12,829
Sorry, Herry.

1476
01:30:14,789 --> 01:30:17,667
( sobbing gasps )

1477
01:30:17,709 --> 01:30:21,004
( voice breaking ):
I'm sorry, Petal.

1478
01:30:21,046 --> 01:30:23,131
I'm so sorry.

1479
01:30:23,173 --> 01:30:25,258
( sniffles )

1480
01:30:26,885 --> 01:30:28,845
I meant Wavey.

1481
01:30:28,887 --> 01:30:34,225
Good. I feel much better.

1482
01:30:34,225 --> 01:30:38,813
When were you going to tell me
about your fucked-up marriage?

1483
01:30:50,367 --> 01:30:52,702
[m] [m]

1484
01:31:18,353 --> 01:31:19,980
I'm scrambling eggs.

1485
01:31:20,021 --> 01:31:21,856
Are you going
to be able to eat?

1486
01:31:22,899 --> 01:31:24,859
No.

1487
01:31:28,113 --> 01:31:31,074
Listen, I'm...

1488
01:31:36,287 --> 01:31:38,999
Maybe I should just go.

1489
01:31:42,377 --> 01:31:45,672
You forget where
the door is?

1490
01:32:01,396 --> 01:32:02,939
( door closes )

1491
01:32:02,981 --> 01:32:05,233
( pan clattering )

1492
01:32:07,319 --> 01:32:09,195
He ran off to Winnipeg
with some little bitch.

1493
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:11,406
She was barely
out of high school.

1494
01:32:11,448 --> 01:32:14,326
Is that fucked up enough
for you?

1495
01:32:14,326 --> 01:32:17,120
Herold...

1496
01:32:17,162 --> 01:32:19,205
my husband,
he didn't die.

1497
01:32:19,247 --> 01:32:21,666
Not that he didn't
deserve to.

1498
01:32:21,666 --> 01:32:24,002
He left me when I was
eight months pregnant;

1499
01:32:24,002 --> 01:32:25,754
no good to him in bed.

1500
01:32:25,795 --> 01:32:29,507
So I took his 15-footer
out into the bay

1501
01:32:29,549 --> 01:32:33,219
cracked the hull with
a hatchet and sunk her

1502
01:32:33,303 --> 01:32:36,097
and pretended
he was drowned

1503
01:32:36,139 --> 01:32:38,141
and played the grieving widow

1504
01:32:38,183 --> 01:32:40,769
and packed my bags
to leave town.

1505
01:32:40,810 --> 01:32:42,729
But then a funny thing happened.

1506
01:32:42,771 --> 01:32:44,522
All these folk I grew up with

1507
01:32:44,522 --> 01:32:47,067
they put their hearts
around me and Herry

1508
01:32:47,108 --> 01:32:48,902
so we wouldn't be alone.

1509
01:32:50,362 --> 01:32:53,239
And I just
couldn't leave.

1510
01:32:53,365 --> 01:32:55,492
I'm sorry, Wavey.

1511
01:32:55,533 --> 01:32:58,203
You're always sorry.

1512
01:33:23,603 --> 01:33:26,272
( crying softly )

1513
01:33:34,197 --> 01:33:37,283
( footsteps approaching )

1514
01:33:38,910 --> 01:33:42,163
You're looking dishy,
Quoyle.

1515
01:33:42,205 --> 01:33:45,417
I'm afraid my offer
to let you stay in my trailer

1516
01:33:45,417 --> 01:33:47,419
will have to be retracted.

1517
01:33:51,631 --> 01:33:55,510
Sorry about that.

1518
01:33:55,552 --> 01:33:57,721
And your boat.

1519
01:33:57,762 --> 01:34:02,726
I'm some disgusted
with the human race.

1520
01:34:02,767 --> 01:34:05,061
I never would have
made it anyway.

1521
01:34:05,103 --> 01:34:07,564
Storms would have
blown me to bits.

1522
01:34:07,605 --> 01:34:11,067
You boys saved my life,
I imagine.

1523
01:34:12,610 --> 01:34:16,740
I've gathered up my savings,
and I'm flying back to Brazil

1524
01:34:16,781 --> 01:34:21,077
where the water is
swimming-pool green.

1525
01:34:23,246 --> 01:34:27,417
You and Bunny can stay
with the wife and me.

1526
01:34:29,628 --> 01:34:31,296
To Brazil.

1527
01:34:32,964 --> 01:34:34,466
Brazil.

1528
01:34:34,507 --> 01:34:35,967
NUTBEEM:
Brazil.

1529
01:34:36,009 --> 01:34:37,969
QUOYLE:
Brazil.

1530
01:34:41,306 --> 01:34:44,100
BUNNY:
We can stay with Aunt Agnis
over at her shop.

1531
01:34:44,142 --> 01:34:45,769
Barely enough room
there for myself.

1532
01:34:45,810 --> 01:34:47,771
You'll like it at
Dennis' house, sweetie.

1533
01:34:47,812 --> 01:34:50,774
No, I won't.

1534
01:34:50,815 --> 01:34:51,941
Hi, Quoyle. Hi, Bunny.

1535
01:34:51,983 --> 01:34:53,026
Welcome, weary travelers.

1536
01:34:53,068 --> 01:34:54,069
Our home's your home.

1537
01:34:54,110 --> 01:34:55,528
BUNNY:
-No, it's not.
-Come on in.

1538
01:34:55,570 --> 01:34:57,364
QUOYLE:
-Bunny...
-Come on in, sweetie.

1539
01:34:57,405 --> 01:34:59,949
I made a big
seal-flipper pie.

1540
01:34:59,991 --> 01:35:01,451
BUNNY:
What's that?

1541
01:35:01,493 --> 01:35:03,828
BEETY:
Weather light. Storm coming.

1542
01:35:03,870 --> 01:35:07,040
DENNIS:
Big one.

1543
01:35:13,004 --> 01:35:15,006
( distant thunder rumbling )

1544
01:35:34,275 --> 01:35:37,195
( thunder rumbling )

1545
01:35:43,368 --> 01:35:47,622
The house... the house...

1546
01:35:47,664 --> 01:35:49,416
house...

1547
01:35:55,046 --> 01:35:56,673
( gasps )

1548
01:35:56,715 --> 01:35:59,134
( panting )

1549
01:35:59,175 --> 01:36:02,804
( thunder crashing )

1550
01:36:27,037 --> 01:36:30,915
( reading softly )
( thunder rumbling )

1551
01:36:49,768 --> 01:36:51,728
[m] [m]

1552
01:37:06,242 --> 01:37:08,578
I...

1553
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:12,082
What is it, Quoyle?

1554
01:37:12,123 --> 01:37:14,834
What?

1555
01:37:14,876 --> 01:37:18,004
( thunder crashes )

1556
01:37:28,723 --> 01:37:30,850
( door creaks open )

1557
01:37:36,147 --> 01:37:38,274
( closes door )

1558
01:37:46,658 --> 01:37:48,660
( thunder crashes )

1559
01:38:01,339 --> 01:38:04,301
( thunder rumbling )

1560
01:38:08,179 --> 01:38:10,348
[m] [m]

1561
01:38:10,390 --> 01:38:13,476
( Celtic drums )

1562
01:38:38,376 --> 01:38:40,337
[m] [m]

1563
01:39:01,358 --> 01:39:04,319
( wind howling )

1564
01:39:30,011 --> 01:39:32,514
It's gone.

1565
01:39:32,555 --> 01:39:33,848
What?

1566
01:39:33,890 --> 01:39:36,559
The green house is gone.

1567
01:39:40,271 --> 01:39:43,525
I didn't dream it.

1568
01:39:43,566 --> 01:39:46,194
Don't say I did.

1569
01:39:48,405 --> 01:39:50,782
( phone ringing )

1570
01:39:52,492 --> 01:39:54,285
Yeah?

1571
01:39:54,285 --> 01:39:56,788
Oh, hi, Mom.
Some storm, eh?

1572
01:39:58,540 --> 01:40:00,292
What?

1573
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:07,340
Oh.

1574
01:40:09,551 --> 01:40:12,304
Yes. Yes, of course.

1575
01:40:33,658 --> 01:40:36,619
BUNNY:
What's a wake?

1576
01:40:36,661 --> 01:40:38,747
QUOYLE:
It's to say good-bye.

1577
01:40:38,788 --> 01:40:41,875
BUNNY:
Mr. Buggit is sleeping
with the angels.

1578
01:40:45,295 --> 01:40:47,672
MAN 1 :
He was a hard man,
but he was fair.

1579
01:40:47,672 --> 01:40:49,799
MAN 2:
Another one
for the Buggit Curse.

1580
01:40:49,841 --> 01:40:51,217
QUOYLE:
Dennis...

1581
01:40:51,259 --> 01:40:53,511
Yeah, I'm still looking
for my dad's Navy medal.

1582
01:40:53,511 --> 01:40:55,513
I found it.

1583
01:40:58,224 --> 01:40:59,351
Don't you worry.

1584
01:40:59,392 --> 01:41:00,935
It's going to be
all right.

1585
01:41:00,977 --> 01:41:02,145
Thank you.

1586
01:41:02,187 --> 01:41:04,314
Mom.

1587
01:41:04,356 --> 01:41:06,191
What?

1588
01:41:06,274 --> 01:41:07,734
( gasps softly):
Good...

1589
01:41:07,776 --> 01:41:10,320
I found it...
in his desk at the office.

1590
01:41:10,362 --> 01:41:15,533
Would you write something for
the Gammy Bird about Jack?

1591
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:18,578
Yes, I'll try.

1592
01:41:22,874 --> 01:41:26,670
BILLY:
Jack is...
Jack is all right now.

1593
01:41:26,711 --> 01:41:31,466
You all know...
we are only passing by.

1594
01:41:31,508 --> 01:41:35,136
We walk over these stones
a few times.

1595
01:41:35,178 --> 01:41:38,556
Our boats...

1596
01:41:38,556 --> 01:41:40,976
sail for a little while
on the waves

1597
01:41:41,017 --> 01:41:43,603
and then they have to sink.

1598
01:41:43,645 --> 01:41:45,981
Jack knew that
better than anyone.

1599
01:41:46,022 --> 01:41:47,691
Right, Jack?

1600
01:41:47,732 --> 01:41:49,484
( whispering ):
Yes, boy.

1601
01:41:55,156 --> 01:41:56,199
( gulps )

1602
01:41:56,241 --> 01:41:58,034
( screams )

1603
01:41:58,076 --> 01:41:59,703
( others screaming )

1604
01:42:02,038 --> 01:42:03,999
( screaming continues )

1605
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:06,626
( screaming )

1606
01:42:11,172 --> 01:42:12,882
He's awake!

1607
01:42:16,011 --> 01:42:16,970
Jack...

1608
01:42:17,012 --> 01:42:18,221
Get a doctor!

1609
01:42:18,263 --> 01:42:20,140
Oh, Jack... oh, Jack...

1610
01:42:20,181 --> 01:42:21,516
( coughing )

1611
01:42:23,935 --> 01:42:25,478
Oh, Jack...

1612
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:27,772
No, no...

1613
01:42:27,772 --> 01:42:30,358
JACK:
Come here, son.
I beat the curse.

1614
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:33,278
The fishing license is yours.

1615
01:42:39,784 --> 01:42:41,536
( siren chirps )

1616
01:42:43,121 --> 01:42:45,373
Sweetheart, you ready?

1617
01:42:45,415 --> 01:42:47,751
I want to have a wake for Petal.

1618
01:42:48,668 --> 01:42:51,129
Why didn't we have
a wake?

1619
01:42:51,129 --> 01:42:52,672
Why didn't we wake her up?

1620
01:42:52,714 --> 01:42:55,383
It worked for him.

1621
01:42:57,552 --> 01:43:00,013
Honey, Mr. Buggit
wasn't really...

1622
01:43:00,055 --> 01:43:01,931
It's more like
he was in a coma.

1623
01:43:01,973 --> 01:43:03,767
From the cold water.

1624
01:43:03,808 --> 01:43:05,143
It's like he
was sleeping.

1625
01:43:05,185 --> 01:43:06,895
-Petal was asleep.
-No, honey...

1626
01:43:06,936 --> 01:43:08,480
You said she was asleep
with the angels.

1627
01:43:08,521 --> 01:43:10,440
I know. Honey, I know
what I said, honey.

1628
01:43:10,482 --> 01:43:11,566
You said! You said!

1629
01:43:11,608 --> 01:43:14,027
-I know, but she's not sleeping.
-You said! You said!

1630
01:43:14,069 --> 01:43:15,779
-Honey, honey, listen to me.
-You said!

1631
01:43:15,820 --> 01:43:16,863
I know what I said.

1632
01:43:16,905 --> 01:43:18,948
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

1633
01:43:18,990 --> 01:43:22,952
I just... I was too scared
to tell you the truth.

1634
01:43:25,413 --> 01:43:28,667
Petal is dead.

1635
01:43:30,794 --> 01:43:32,796
And you know that.

1636
01:43:32,837 --> 01:43:34,464
I know you know it.

1637
01:43:39,344 --> 01:43:41,805
It's okay.

1638
01:43:43,098 --> 01:43:46,810
Is it because of me?

1639
01:43:46,851 --> 01:43:48,228
What?

1640
01:43:48,269 --> 01:43:50,689
That she drove away.

1641
01:43:50,730 --> 01:43:53,775
Well, why would you
say that?

1642
01:43:53,817 --> 01:43:55,902
Because...

1643
01:43:55,944 --> 01:43:58,655
because I'm boring.

1644
01:44:02,784 --> 01:44:04,035
( crying )

1645
01:44:04,077 --> 01:44:05,286
Oh...

1646
01:44:07,956 --> 01:44:12,085
No, honey, it's not
because of you.

1647
01:44:14,212 --> 01:44:17,549
And you are anything
but boring.

1648
01:44:17,549 --> 01:44:19,884
Come here.

1649
01:44:19,884 --> 01:44:22,178
You just come here.

1650
01:44:23,555 --> 01:44:25,724
Hon...

1651
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,728
You believe me, don't you?

1652
01:44:32,939 --> 01:44:37,527
You still don't
believe me, do you?

1653
01:44:38,570 --> 01:44:40,947
About the house.

1654
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:47,579
I told you so.

1655
01:45:00,550 --> 01:45:03,053
It's all right.

1656
01:45:03,094 --> 01:45:05,013
Worse things have happened.

1657
01:45:05,055 --> 01:45:08,183
To both of us.

1658
01:45:08,266 --> 01:45:12,812
Maybe one day we'll build
a summerhouse out here.

1659
01:45:12,854 --> 01:45:15,899
Summer...

1660
01:45:15,940 --> 01:45:18,193
BUNNY:
Do they have summer here?

1661
01:45:18,276 --> 01:45:22,113
AGNIS:
Oh, you'll know it's summer when
the partridge berries are out.

1662
01:45:22,113 --> 01:45:24,282
WAVEY:
And we can make
partridge berry duff

1663
01:45:24,324 --> 01:45:27,619
and sweet berry okie.

1664
01:45:27,661 --> 01:45:29,954
Will you show me how?

1665
01:45:29,996 --> 01:45:31,957
I will, yeah.

1666
01:45:31,998 --> 01:45:33,750
I will.

1667
01:45:33,792 --> 01:45:37,879
QUOYLE:
There are still so many things
I don't know.

1668
01:45:37,921 --> 01:45:41,716
If a piece ofknotted string
can unleash the wind

1669
01:45:41,758 --> 01:45:45,637
and if a drowned man
can awaken...

1670
01:45:47,180 --> 01:45:50,475
then I believe
a broken man can heal.

1671
01:45:57,565 --> 01:46:00,235
Headline:

1672
01:46:00,318 --> 01:46:02,737
Deadly Storm Takes House.

1673
01:46:04,531 --> 01:46:08,702
Leaves... Excellent View.
