1
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,150
Stab wound to the chest, heavy blood
loss, blood pressure dropping.

2
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:54,286
Make sure we have uncrossed
matched blood waiting.

3
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,155
Five milligrams
of morphine, IV.

4
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:57,523
Is surgery prepping?

5
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:31,290
<i>This is simple, Maggie.</i>

6
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:34,093
<i>All you have to do</i>
<i>is tell the truth.</i>

7
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,728
<i>It's the easiest thing</i>
<i>to remember.</i>

8
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:50,275
<i>Breathe.</i>

9
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,713
<i>Try again.</i>

10
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,515
<i>Slower.</i>

11
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:06,258
I was just leaving
when she was dropping...

12
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,861
She was... I'm sorry.

13
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:13,565
Um, I was just dropping
something off at her house.

14
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,903
<i>Who was at the house</i>
<i>when you first got there?</i>

15
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,205
<i>Hannah.</i>

16
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:55,240
It's in the kitchen next...
on the counter.

17
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:56,875
It's on the counter
next to the stove.

18
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,379
Excuse me.

19
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:03,382
You're not gonna stop
and say hello?

20
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:05,918
I know you have family over,

21
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,553
so I was just... you know.

22
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:08,887
So...

23
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,356
So you just...

24
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,958
baked a beautiful cake...

25
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,828
and were just gonna drop it off
with some flowers and leave?

26
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,331
I just... I want to
let... I don't know.

27
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,900
Pfft!

28
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,703
I just want to let you know I was
thinking of you, that's all.

29
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,372
I... I really don't
want to intrude.

30
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,342
Are you kidding me? We have tons of food.
You must join us.

31
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:32,911
Are you sure? Yes.

32
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,646
Thanks.

33
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,951
Besides, I need your help.
My mother is here.

34
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,624
What time did you finish
your work last night?

35
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:46,992
6:30.

36
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,696
How do you know her?

37
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,267
We worked at Pretty Pennies
online store.

38
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,272
She kind of took me
under her wing.

39
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:02,507
<i>She's like that.</i>

40
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,744
Hey, everyone, look what
I found in the yard.

41
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,547
<i>And there's her husband,</i>
<i>of course, Michael.</i>

42
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,015
I hope you didn't let her in.

43
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:12,985
Uh, I can always
take my cake back...

44
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:15,387
and eat it without you guys.

45
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:19,258
Oh, no. If you brought us
gifts, that's different.

46
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,993
Come here. Oh, okay.

47
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,862
Anyone else at that time?

48
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,266
Luke.

49
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:29,301
- Hey, baby, how's it going?
- Good.

50
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:31,670
- Long time.
- I know. Long time no see.

51
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,006
How are you?
I'm great. Let me get these.

52
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:35,841
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

53
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:38,977
- If it helps, just yell.
- Okay.

54
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,979
While you're at it, maybe get
Hannah up dancing or something,

55
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,782
because her ass is just too fine
to be sitting on a chair all day.

56
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,885
Bethany, I am going to slap your
husband for being inappropriate.

57
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,521
Ladies, ladies, I bear gifts. Where
did you get those? They're beautiful.

58
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:51,290
Is this a cake? Yes.

59
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:53,458
Maggie's here, and she's
joining us for dinner. Good.

60
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,027
Jean, where do they keep
their vases in here?

61
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,762
I don't know.
I can't find anything.

62
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:59,464
So in your search, if you find
a colander, give me a call.

63
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,801
You know, in fact,
you should give me a call...

64
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,071
to let me know why my daughter
doesn't call, because...

65
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:08,840
This has nothing
to do with him.

66
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,076
Wait, whoa, whoa. What has
nothing to do with me?

67
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:13,812
What has nothing to do with me?

68
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,881
You don't communicate,
that's what the problem is.

69
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,749
Mom, would you cook? Does this
look like it's a problem?

70
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,685
I don't see any grand babies,

71
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:22,954
so obviously there's some problem
with intercourse somewhere.

72
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:25,857
We just got married. Stop it.
Just stop. Don't.

73
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,527
And I'm not talking about sex
with my mother-in-law again.

74
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:31,463
Oh. Well, you may not want
to talk about it,

75
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,899
but let me tell you, what were you
doing during that six-year engagement?

76
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,652
I am not talking sex
with my mother-in-law.

77
00:05:35,678 --> 00:05:36,368
Get out. Out!

78
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,337
Get out!
Get me a glass of wine.

79
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,472
Mom, seriously.
You've had too many.

80
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,110
No? Okay.

81
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:47,346
Hannah, the house
looks wonderful.

82
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:48,914
You should banish me
more often.

83
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,550
That's funny, Jean. I was
thinking the exact same thing.

84
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:53,852
We didn't banish anyone.

85
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,888
We just didn't
want... you around.

86
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,523
Well, if you wanted
to be alone,

87
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,025
you should have gone
on a vacation...

88
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:03,128
to a beach, with rum drinks
and little umbrellas.

89
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,130
Jean, have a glass of wine.

90
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:07,466
I think you'll find that's
called a "stay cation."

91
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:11,036
- It's environmentally friendly.
- It's basically a vacation but at home.

92
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,672
Hmm? For a whole year?

93
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,941
It wasn't a year, Mom.

94
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:17,809
It felt like a year.

95
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,845
And besides, a "stay cation"?

96
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:21,713
I don't know. Sounds like
something poor people do.

97
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,815
Mom!

98
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,917
Jean, that's awful.
You're an awful snob.

99
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,887
You are!

100
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,523
I know that you're not poor,
although...

101
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:34,993
I don't exactly know how you make
money with an online clothing store,

102
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,095
because people can just order things,
and they can wear them out...

103
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,898
to, you know, a rave or
whatever, and then...

104
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,667
Don't laugh at me.

105
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:45,470
And then they can just send it
back and expect a full refund.

106
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,005
That is something
that you would do, Mom.

107
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,574
Sorry. Hang on a minute, Jean. Are
you telling me you go to raves?

108
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,610
- Because, I have to say...
- Frequently.

109
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:54,179
Killer moves. Very, very sexy.

110
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:56,148
Shut up. Yeah.

111
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,818
No, most people are cool,
you know.

112
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,455
Sometimes we do get stuff back that
smells kind of like fish food.

113
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:07,275
But we have a special file
for those guys, don't we?

114
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,427
Yes, we do.

115
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:10,629
"Fish food files." Very clever.

116
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:12,097
Was that a compliment? Mm-hmm.

117
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,132
You should just stop
while you're ahead.

118
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:17,436
I think it was. This looks delicious.
Let's start.

119
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:21,072
Thank you to the chef.
Cheers. Cheers.

120
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,475
Seriously, that's great.

121
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:25,644
No, no. No, thank you.

122
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:27,946
Ever since he found out Cabernet
has calories, he's scared of it.

123
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,068
- No.
- I'm terrified.

124
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,585
Hannah, sweetie,
that's your third glass.

125
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:37,090
I know that, Mom. My
husband's an accountant.

126
00:07:37,116 --> 00:07:38,156
Bad girl.

127
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:41,827
Yes, I'm just saying that you have to be
careful about mixing alcohol and your meds.

128
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,862
But it makes your teeth
so pretty and pink.

129
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,931
I'm fine, Mom.

130
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:48,667
- No, you're not.
- Mom!

131
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,735
Why don't you pass Maggie
the sauce?

132
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,938
No one gives a shit
about the sauce.

133
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,940
You are an Olympic deflector.

134
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:57,542
Why are we not
really talking here? Hmm?

135
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:00,512
Honesty is healthy.

136
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:03,915
You guys are so desperate
to be cheerful, and...

137
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,051
we're acting like
nothing happened.

138
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:10,489
This is what happens when
families are apart too long.

139
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:13,024
Jean, you know, I think the
important thing right now...

140
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,893
is that we are all here.

141
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:17,596
Only because we were
allowed to be here.

142
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,168
Yeah, and it means a lot
that you came.

143
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:27,672
I think that Emma
would have really liked it.

144
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:31,743
Yeah, it feels good to be
together again, as a family.

145
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,546
Yes, it does.

146
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:39,718
Michael and Hannah, I love you
both so much, and I just...

147
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,653
I think that...

148
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:45,156
the best thing we have to offer to the
world is your combined gene pool.

149
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,292
And I think the family
should expand,

150
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:49,594
and I want some
grand babies to squeeze.

151
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:23,595
If you don't need a therapist,
why do you need<i> those?</i>

152
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:27,699
Therapy is doing nothing but
making me more depressed, Mom.

153
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:29,634
Then change therapists.

154
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,605
You think that you can
just come in here...

155
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:36,087
and start telling me what to do?
I...

156
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,649
Do you know what it's like
to lose a child, Dr. Woods?

157
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,887
No. Oh.

158
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:51,823
It's like she's not
where she's supposed to be.

159
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,792
She's not in my arms.

160
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,631
And I know she's gone,

161
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:02,701
but that doesn't stop me
from looking for her.

162
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:23,622
So, they had Bethany come back
and bought this feng shui CD.

163
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:27,258
And it sounded so bad. It sounded
like Japanese porn music.

164
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:31,262
So I played it
the next time we've done it.

165
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:37,836
- TMI for a mother-in-law.
- Sorry.

166
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:43,308
Weird! I keep thinking she's still up in
her room and we're gonna wake her up.

167
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,077
- Beth.
- I'm so sorry.

168
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,213
It's okay. No.

169
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:50,849
We're fine. Really.

170
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:53,284
We're just glad you're here.

171
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:56,154
Maggie, can you hurry up
with that sugar rush...

172
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,424
before my husband bores us to
death with one of his speeches?

173
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,860
Yeah, well, it looks terrific.
Let's cut it.

174
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:05,330
- One second, Jean. Um...
- Oop, too late.

175
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,732
Thank you for the
introduction, sweetheart.

176
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:10,935
Um, we just wanted to say...

177
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:14,439
it's been a difficult year,
but, um,

178
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:17,175
in honor of her birthday...

179
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,880
- To Emma.
- To Emma.

180
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:23,348
- To Emma.
- To Emma.

181
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,183
- To Emma.
- To Emma.

182
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,155
Now let's have some cake.

183
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,160
Whoa. How did she do that?

184
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:40,799
That is so weird. The knife
just moved by itself.

185
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:43,201
Whoa! That was weird.

186
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,304
No, you're being silly.
You just bumped the table.

187
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:49,441
- What's in this coffee?
- Here, you do it.

188
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:52,077
Okay, as I remember,

189
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,946
big pieces for the boys, yes?

190
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,282
Excuse me.

191
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,451
Beth? Honey...

192
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,056
Now...

193
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,929
Why don't you tell me...

194
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,833
how the others died.

195
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,174
Oh, my God.

196
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:47,225
Jesus! Shit! You scared me.

197
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:50,295
What is wrong with you?

198
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,498
You look terrible.

199
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:57,202
- Are you pregnant?
- No.

200
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:59,137
Can we just not have
this conversation?

201
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,872
What are you waiting for?

202
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,507
Mom, now...

203
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:08,313
It's just not fair
to Hannah, you know?

204
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:11,282
What's not fair to Hannah?

205
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,219
I should have come before.

206
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:16,154
But you couldn't.

207
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:18,923
Well, no, I didn't... Tea?

208
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,359
I didn't want to come here and
make you feel bad, you know...

209
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,596
I got a little overemotional...

210
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:29,067
I've been such a mess
that it doesn't even matter.

211
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:30,602
Okay?

212
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:32,337
Wait, wa...

213
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,472
Wait. I'm sorry.

214
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:37,008
You didn't invite me to come...

215
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,977
to be with you,

216
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:41,512
and yet you asked her?

217
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,181
Is that right?

218
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:46,951
And did you come?

219
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,186
No.

220
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:54,192
I bet you didn't even get an e-mail
saying that she was too busy.

221
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,427
Totally understandable.

222
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,464
Mom,<i> I</i> invited
Bethany to come...

223
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,399
because she doesn't judge me...

224
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,202
and Luke because
he makes Michael laugh.

225
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,504
But you didn't come,

226
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:10,441
because of your
precious emotions.

227
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:13,278
You have always been
a narcissist.

228
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,680
Mom, that's not... Mm, mm, mm.

229
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,052
She's right.

230
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:23,421
No, she's not.

231
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:28,293
I'm sorry.

232
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:31,296
It gave me a chance, um...
or just gave me a reason...

233
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:35,033
not to clear out her room.

234
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:36,715
I thought maybe you'd
want to say good-bye.

235
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,305
I'd like that.

236
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,141
I know.

237
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:45,109
I do it every day.

238
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,985
Okay.

239
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:56,988
Hannah.

240
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:02,220
So is Beth okay?
She'll be fine, hon.

241
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,389
She's always had a flair
for the dramatic.

242
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:06,591
She just needs a minute.

243
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,292
Cocktails, anyone? Mm-hmm.

244
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:10,428
You know, I think
I'll make some<i> tea.</i>

245
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,732
Would anyone else like some<i> tea?
</i> Uh, no, thanks, Mom.

246
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,402
Hannah, should I go
check on Bethany?

247
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,237
She's fine. I...

248
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:22,240
Well, I imagine being the
world's first human magnet...

249
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,042
would mess with
your head a little.

250
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:27,412
I'm sorry. Did that not just
freak everyone the fuck out?

251
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:29,547
There has to be a logical
explanation to that.

252
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,717
Well, the lodestone is
indigenous to this area.

253
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:36,387
You take, um, the ocean
being nearby,

254
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,556
full moon in the springtime,

255
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,727
and it probably caused some kind
of freak electromagnetic reaction.

256
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,529
Really?

257
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:47,331
And I just saw
an Asian leprechaun...

258
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,467
with an Afro...

259
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,302
run by the front door.

260
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,704
You've got too much time
on your... Shh! What...

261
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,141
- Did you guys just hear that?
- What?

262
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:59,610
- Did you hear something?
- I didn't hear anything.

263
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:03,181
- I thought I heard a screaming.
- I'm gonna go check on Bethany.

264
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:04,682
I'll be back in a minute.

265
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,317
You didn't hear that?
No, I didn't.

266
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,819
You didn't just hear that? No.

267
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:10,822
I'm sure it was Jean.

268
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,521
Beth?

269
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,625
Are you okay? Yeah, I think so.

270
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,161
Are you sure?

271
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:51,329
Yeah.

272
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,299
I think I might have
just passed out.

273
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,807
Do you want me to call
you a doctor? No.

274
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,742
No, I...

275
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:07,712
I'm just exhausted.

276
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,716
I don't want
to cause anymore fuss.

277
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,686
Okay?

278
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:18,222
Am I interrupting anything?

279
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:21,259
Hey. No, not at all.

280
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:24,495
Maybe you can come out here and
talk some sense into your sister.

281
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,364
I think she might need
a little doctor.

282
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:28,766
I don't need to see a doctor.

283
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,636
I'll leave you guys alone.

284
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:34,279
I'll see you in a bit. Okay.

285
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,545
Hey, honey. Hey.

286
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:41,746
Hey.

287
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:46,484
You feeling okay?

288
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:47,952
I feel horrible.

289
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:50,288
Aw.

290
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,956
What's the matter?

291
00:19:57,964 --> 00:20:01,499
Bethany, what are you doing?

292
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:02,967
Ow!

293
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,838
Cast me out...

294
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,609
into the ungodly and turn me over
into to the hands of the wicked.

295
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:13,945
What are you saying? You're
among the wicked, Hannah.

296
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,913
Bethany, are you okay?

297
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:18,616
You're among the wicked.
Bethany, stop that. Ow!

298
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:20,551
You're scaring me. Stop!

299
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,386
I know your secret. Give me...

300
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,889
Hey! I know your secret.

301
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,792
- I know your secret!
- Stop it, Bethany!

302
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:30,394
This isn't fucking funny anymore.
Let go of me!

303
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:33,965
Stop it!

304
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,905
Geez.

305
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:56,887
Why glimpse through
an abomination to the Lord?

306
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,391
It says here your sister...

307
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:03,894
was in a recovery center
in 1996...

308
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,530
for... exhaustion.

309
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:09,433
Hmm. Interesting euphemism.

310
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,450
What was she in recovery for?

311
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:18,943
Uh... She was in rehab
for, like, a week.

312
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:22,546
But it was because she was
having panic attacks. Mm-hmm.

313
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:26,917
I guess she thought that pot
smoking might help with that.

314
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:30,554
These panic attacks, were they
the result of her drug use,

315
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:34,492
or was the psychosis a, um,
preexisting condition?

316
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,361
No, no, she...

317
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:39,797
I mean-I mean,
she wasn't a drug addict,

318
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,667
and she wasn't mentally ill.

319
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:45,836
She was just ranting like
she was batshit crazy.

320
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:48,873
Sweetheart, please.
You know how she is.

321
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,310
Don't let her rattle
your cage so much.

322
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:53,472
Yeah.

323
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:02,053
- My family drives me nuts.
- I know.

324
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:03,821
Everybody's does, right?

325
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,756
Yeah.

326
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,360
Mmm.

327
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,964
- Is that Bethany?
- Hannah, wait, wait, wait.

328
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:15,599
Was that Bethany?

329
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,541
Beth!

330
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:25,576
Beth! What the hell is going on?

331
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:27,745
Sweetheart!

332
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:30,047
Beth? Oh, my God. Honey!

333
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,916
Do you have anything
to calm her down?

334
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:35,086
Hannah, go get the pills now.
What pills? What?

335
00:22:35,088 --> 00:22:36,754
Please! We don't know
what she's already taken.

336
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:38,989
Okay, okay, okay. She could
have been high already.

337
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:40,091
Bethany?

338
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:55,473
Oh!

339
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,651
Hannah!

340
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:09,487
Hannah!

341
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:14,458
Hannah!

342
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,700
Hannah!

343
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,438
- Okay, let me in.
- Bethany, breathe, honey.

344
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,407
Shh! You got it? Slow down!

345
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:30,941
I got her. Okay, okay.

346
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:33,411
Let's drink this. Come on.
Just breathe. Shh!

347
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,546
Okay, just one breathe.

348
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:37,915
Easy, easy, easy.
Shh, shh, shh.

349
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,683
Swallow it. Swallow it.

350
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:41,719
Swallow...

351
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:43,988
What? Is it supposed
to work that fast?

352
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,723
I don't think so.

353
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,734
Luke! You still with us?

354
00:23:56,736 --> 00:23:58,869
Have you seen this?

355
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,139
Oh, my God.

356
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:06,710
Okay.

357
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,948
Let's try this again, shall we?

358
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,352
Did you write
the message, Luke?

359
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,991
If you think I'd write some fucked
up message to my in-laws...

360
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:24,061
about their dead daughter,

361
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:26,497
then maybe you're the one
who needs their head checked.

362
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,101
Sweetheart...

363
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:34,104
garbage disposals don't
just turn themselves on.

364
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:37,641
I'm not crazy, Michael.
I tried to turn it off. I did.

365
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,577
It wouldn't turn off.

366
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:40,678
Guys...

367
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,883
Do you think
this could be Emma?

368
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:49,720
Like Emma's spirit, maybe?

369
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:52,523
No, no, no.

370
00:24:52,525 --> 00:24:54,525
Her ghost, maybe.

371
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:57,528
- Please, let's not go there.
- Her ghost?

372
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,097
Why wouldn't she have just
gone straight to heaven?

373
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,800
I mean, Emma was only three
years old, for Christ's sake.

374
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:08,005
I know someone
that can help us.

375
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:10,327
I can get her to come over.

376
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,677
Is she a doctor?

377
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,980
She's someone that can tell us
if it's really Emma or not.

378
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:19,984
Worst-case scenario, we rule out
any other sort of possibilities.

379
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:22,953
So, you mean she's a psychic?

380
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:24,688
The last thing we need is...

381
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:29,159
some woo-woo,
carny weirdo that...

382
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:32,730
What kind of person comes to strangers'
houses in the middle of the night?

383
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:34,865
Hmm?

384
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,267
Michael?

385
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,837
Jean...

386
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:42,006
If she's here, I want to know.

387
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:44,742
Bethany wrote it.

388
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:47,278
Bethany wrote it, Jean?
Really? How?

389
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,979
And how did she do that?

390
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:51,615
If my wife is crazy,
I wanna know.

391
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,052
Hey, I wanna go to bed.

392
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,087
Keep an eye on her tonight.

393
00:25:57,089 --> 00:26:00,024
Get her a doctor first
thing in the morning.

394
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:02,059
But right now she should rest.

395
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:07,064
I feel terrible.

396
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,666
Maggie.

397
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:15,039
Call your friend.

398
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,344
Do you think
your wife was possessed?

399
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:24,248
No. I don't know.

400
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,250
I don't know anything.

401
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:29,186
I don't even know how we
ended up with a psychic.

402
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,659
Samara, come in.

403
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:42,299
Can I take your jacket
or... your hat?

404
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:45,135
Do you mind if we skip the pleasantries
and I just take a look around?

405
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:48,105
Yeah, do you mind if I come with?
Yeah, I do, actually.

406
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:51,375
Emma's room is
upstairs to the left.

407
00:26:51,377 --> 00:26:53,744
Yeah, it is. That
wasn't a question.

408
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:55,713
Where are the others?
In the dining room.

409
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:58,182
Keep them there.

410
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,817
Subtle.

411
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:47,765
Hmm.

412
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,174
Ow!

413
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:32,276
Ow.

414
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:34,244
All right, I get it.

415
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:51,929
Well, congratulations. There
is definitely a presence here.

416
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:55,966
It's a pretty strong one.

417
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:58,035
How old was Emma when she died?

418
00:28:58,037 --> 00:29:00,971
She was, um... Almost four.

419
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:02,773
And how long have you been
in this house?

420
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:05,209
Shouldn't you know
all this already?

421
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:08,178
Almost five years.

422
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,481
How did she die?

423
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:13,003
She... It was an
accident at home.

424
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,220
I found her.

425
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,224
Okay.

426
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,528
I'm gonna need some candles.

427
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,831
White ones preferably.

428
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:32,202
I'm going to try to make contact...
with this entity.

429
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,239
Okay, so before we begin,

430
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:37,341
I must warn you that
this is serious shit.

431
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:40,310
This is not a game.

432
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:42,246
And if anybody needs to go
to the bathroom,

433
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:44,047
I suggest that you do so now,

434
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:47,449
because people have been
known to piss their pants.

435
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,821
I'll be right back.

436
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:00,531
That... That was Emma's.

437
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,471
Please concentrate. Focus.

438
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,820
I call upon
the guiding spirits...

439
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:25,589
to cloak each and every soul
in this room tonight...

440
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:27,991
in your glowing white light.

441
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:32,196
I'd also like to invite the four
archangels to be the gatekeepers.

442
00:30:32,198 --> 00:30:36,533
Michael to be the protector,
Uriel to guard the circle,

443
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:40,604
Gabriel to be the communicator
and Raphael to be the healer.

444
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:45,509
I ask that the masters keep
this room bathed in white light,

445
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:48,312
and may we always be
acting for the highest good.

446
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,380
Thank you.

447
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:51,548
Amen.

448
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,916
Amen.

449
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:54,251
Amen.

450
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:55,853
Abracadabra.

451
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,590
Maggie, could you please
change seats with Luke?

452
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,527
- Any reason?
- You're pretty.

453
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,896
Oh.

454
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:18,375
We're here tonight to try to
make contact with Emma Anderson,

455
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,645
the young girl
who died in this house.

456
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,482
Emma.

457
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:28,952
Are you here with us?

458
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,659
Emma, would you like
to speak to us?

459
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,108
Emma, is that you?

460
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,110
I'm here.

461
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,948
Are you the young girl Emma
that died in this house?

462
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,384
No, I'm not dead.

463
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,986
Oh, my God.

464
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,556
Where are you, Emma?

465
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,392
Aunt Bethany's house.

466
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:11,561
- How did you get in Bethany's house?
- Mommy.

467
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:13,430
Mommy took you
to Bethany's house?

468
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,098
What does she mean
by Bethany's house?

469
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,200
Are you mad at Mommy, Emma?

470
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:19,536
- Mommy hurt...
- Okay, this is bullshit!

471
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:21,939
- Sit back down.
- I'm done with this, okay? Enough!

472
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:23,573
- Hannah, please.
- Are you kidding me?

473
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:25,509
Is it because Mommy
didn't come with you?

474
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:28,078
Are you just gonna just sit
here and listen to this woman?

475
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,457
Because Mommy couldn't
come to where you are?

476
00:32:30,483 --> 00:32:31,181
It hurts.

477
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,582
Oh.

478
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:34,484
Did it hurt you
when you died, Emma?

479
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:37,154
Get this woman
out of my house right now!

480
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,190
Oh, I'll get the lights.

481
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:51,034
Once invited into play,
darkness does not go away.

482
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:54,504
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, there's no God here, lover.

483
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:57,040
Not that that would
bother you, Hannah.

484
00:32:57,042 --> 00:33:00,177
How one lives with herself,
I'd really like to know.

485
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:02,045
Please, who are you?

486
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:04,381
"Please."

487
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:07,150
I like that.

488
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,129
What do you want with Beth?

489
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:13,523
Oh, nothing that 53 men
haven't done before you, Luke.

490
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,492
Bethany is me. I am Bethany.

491
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,260
We're the best of friends.

492
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:19,563
- You stay away from my wife.
- Or what?

493
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:25,402
Exactly, you spineless worm.

494
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:27,504
Besides...

495
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:31,375
We like it here.

496
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:33,210
I am home.

497
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,182
Beth!

498
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,286
Beth? Beth?

499
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:55,198
So, what happened
after the table shook...

500
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,402
and Samara teleported...

501
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:01,605
from one side of the room
to the other?

502
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:04,107
Dr. Woods...

503
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,084
Don't you think our minds sometimes
block things out for a reason?

504
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,722
That's okay.

505
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,690
You have to talk
to me, Michael.

506
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:22,426
You're gonna have
to tell me things.

507
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:27,564
I've been doing this for,
oh, damn near 22 years.

508
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,132
It's an unfair advantage.

509
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,203
Most killers don't have
that much experience.

510
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:35,138
You got it?

511
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,545
She's looking better.

512
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:46,183
You okay, princess? Michael.

513
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,619
Michael.

514
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:51,421
Oh, Michael.

515
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,825
Michael, come close.

516
00:34:59,231 --> 00:35:02,232
Oh, Michael.

517
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:04,201
Mmm.

518
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:05,735
You made me so wet.

519
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:11,174
Oh, my God.

520
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,513
I want you so much.

521
00:35:16,515 --> 00:35:18,882
Beth?

522
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:20,517
Touch me.

523
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:24,554
Mmm. Michael,
I want you so much.

524
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:26,189
Bethany.

525
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,232
Come on, Michael.

526
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,901
No secrets anymore.

527
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,405
We both know
you still think about me.

528
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:44,908
- She doesn't know what she's saying.
- She does.

529
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,410
Ask Michael.

530
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:50,347
Tell me she's wrong, Michael.

531
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:52,349
Is she wrong, Michael?

532
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:54,618
Come on, Michael.
No secrets anymore.

533
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,786
We both know you still think
about sleeping with me.

534
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:58,722
Tell me she's wrong.
Whoa, whoa!

535
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:00,223
Hey, hey! No, no, no!

536
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:02,192
- Stop it! Ow!
- - Sorry, sorry.

537
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:04,661
Fuck, just stop.

538
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,163
Bastard!

539
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:09,766
Oh, Hannah, you know
you married a whore.

540
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:12,435
And by the way,
the sluttier you act,

541
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:15,839
the more pathetic you look
and the more you disgust him.

542
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:18,642
Just stop it now, okay?
Stop it, Bethany. Stop it!

543
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:20,777
Hey, Hannah, I love you.

544
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:22,812
- There's only you.
- Liar!

545
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:25,682
He's always wanted me more.

546
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,419
How could you?

547
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:31,955
Don't think she doesn't
lie to you too, Michael.

548
00:36:31,957 --> 00:36:33,790
Tell him your secret, Hannah.

549
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,693
What?

550
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:45,735
Emma didn't just<i> fall</i> down
the stairs all on her own,

551
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:48,438
did she now?

552
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,443
Hannah. Hannah?

553
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:56,446
I'm asking you.

554
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:59,449
What did you do to Emma?

555
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:01,918
Hannah's favorite thing
about working from the home...

556
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,589
is the fact that
she didn't have to drive.

557
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:09,226
She could drink
as much as she wanted.

558
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:12,829
Hannah didn't find Emma
at the bottom of the stairs.

559
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:15,332
No. She put her there.

560
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:16,967
You lie! Shut up...

561
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,575
A toddler in one arm,
a drink in the other.

562
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,444
She lost her step.

563
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:31,982
She dropped her child,
but not the drink.

564
00:37:31,984 --> 00:37:33,917
No.

565
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,286
She didn't spill a drop.

566
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:39,422
Oh, God, no!

567
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:44,027
- How do you know this?
- Who are you?

568
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:48,431
I'm Belial, Lord of the Flies.

569
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,900
I can see into your soul,

570
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:54,871
and you're the man who left his
child in the care of a drunk.

571
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:57,540
You condemned your child.

572
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:01,311
She just carried out
the sentence.

573
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,868
I want my lawyer.

574
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,836
Luke, you have two choices.

575
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:29,673
You can stay and we can talk
a little longer,

576
00:38:29,675 --> 00:38:31,775
or you can go wait in the cell
for a few hours,

577
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:34,177
and then we can talk
a little longer.

578
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,814
What do you want to know?

579
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:42,319
You don't think
your wife's condition...

580
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:45,021
was a convenient distraction
for what was really going on?

581
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:47,390
I know my wife.

582
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:48,892
She wasn't there.

583
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:55,398
And I know if I called
the police or a doctor,

584
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,802
they would have pumped her
full of lithium...

585
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:04,541
and locked her in a padded cell
with that thing inside her.

586
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:27,097
Please come in.

587
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,135
Father Patrick.

588
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:33,770
We spoke earlier on the phone.

589
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:35,972
Thanks for coming.

590
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,975
So where's your wife now?

591
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:40,818
She's... She's upstairs.

592
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:43,813
Thanks. So come in.

593
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:48,985
Have you called a psychiatrist?

594
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,589
We thought about it.

595
00:39:52,591 --> 00:39:54,958
Father, are you able
to perform exorcisms?

596
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,562
Exorcisms went out
in about the 1600s.

597
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:03,433
No matter what you've seen in the
movies, they are pretty much extinct.

598
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:06,002
And psychology's
taken over now,

599
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:10,006
and mental illness is usually...

600
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:14,511
account for most cases
of peculiar activity.

601
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:19,749
We stopped witch hunts too.

602
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,819
What about miracles?

603
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:25,901
Does the church have a
scientific explanation for that?

604
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:30,059
Miracles are real.

605
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:01,024
I'm freezing.

606
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:07,130
Luke?

607
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,602
Luke?

608
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,860
Who are you?

609
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,866
It's okay.

610
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:45,969
It's okay. It's okay.

611
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:55,245
You're mine.

612
00:41:56,814 --> 00:42:00,683
So you say
this entity, or demon,

613
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,086
if that's what it is,

614
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:04,821
speaks to you?

615
00:42:04,823 --> 00:42:07,557
He said he was
the light bringer,

616
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:09,893
also known as morning star.

617
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:12,095
He also said he was
king of the flies,

618
00:42:12,097 --> 00:42:14,831
whatever that means.

619
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:16,933
Well, Lucifer is a more common
name for "light bringer,"

620
00:42:16,935 --> 00:42:20,670
which translates
into "morning star."

621
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:24,040
Belial is the Lord
of the Flies.

622
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:27,043
I mean, all these are
references to the devil.

623
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:29,712
I mean, it being the
devil itself, however,

624
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,955
stretches the outer
reaches of...

625
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,618
likelihood and
even possibility.

626
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:40,290
Look, Father, my wife
is in the other room...

627
00:42:40,292 --> 00:42:43,593
with something pretty
unfriendly inside her.

628
00:42:43,595 --> 00:42:47,564
So I'm about ready to try
anything you've got.

629
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:51,601
All right. So what do you think may
have attracted the devil to your wife?

630
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:56,205
He means,
"Is she a bad person?"

631
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:58,908
- She's as good as gold.
- If that's the case,

632
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:03,212
it is possible that she was the
victim of a poor environment.

633
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:04,363
M-Morally speaking.

634
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:07,750
My daughter was raised in
a wonderful environment.

635
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:10,053
And morally speaking,

636
00:43:10,055 --> 00:43:14,123
what you're doing is actually
fanning the flames of superstition.

637
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:17,860
What, are you recruiting
by fear these days?

638
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:19,762
Bethany doesn't need a priest.

639
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,264
She doesn't need a psychic.

640
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:23,427
She needs medical help.

641
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:29,172
It is the middle of the night.
I'm going home.

642
00:43:29,174 --> 00:43:31,874
But I will be back
in the morning...

643
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:35,678
with a professional in tow.

644
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,683
Jean... Mom, I'll walk you out.

645
00:43:40,685 --> 00:43:43,219
Jean, thank you.

646
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:58,968
The devil, my ass.

647
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:04,007
I will be back tomorrow.

648
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:07,010
So... you hold the fort, hmm?

649
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:09,679
Okay.

650
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:13,850
I'm sorry.

651
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,830
Are you ready, Father?

652
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:44,714
Okay.

653
00:44:47,686 --> 00:44:50,887
Beth! Bethany! Bethany!

654
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:54,190
I guess this is how Christine felt when
you left her on the side of the road.

655
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,826
What? You didn't know her name?

656
00:44:56,828 --> 00:45:00,430
They're filthy liars,
Father, but not me.

657
00:45:00,432 --> 00:45:03,132
No! No! Get off!

658
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:10,273
You know, Father, if you
wanna be screwed with,

659
00:45:10,275 --> 00:45:12,108
you should make
a little effort, you know,

660
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:14,711
maybe curl up that pretty
hair of yours or something.

661
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:16,179
Should keep her tied down,

662
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:18,181
somewhere we can
see her preferably.

663
00:45:18,183 --> 00:45:21,184
Come on.

664
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:38,468
Normally no, but...

665
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:42,972
Under these circumstances...

666
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:49,278
I think it's best we wait before
we attempt anything else.

667
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,081
Dark powers are strongest
in the late hours.

668
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,421
Why don't you
stay over, Father?

669
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:03,318
We'd all feel safer
with you around.

670
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:07,130
Uh, no.

671
00:46:07,132 --> 00:46:10,166
I must go and pray and seek
guidance from the church...

672
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:13,970
if... I mean, how best
to fight this.

673
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:26,182
Please try and keep Bethany
as comfortable as possible.

674
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,520
Stay together.

675
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,530
You're stronger that way.

676
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:39,228
And I'll see you
in the morning, Maggie.

677
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:54,076
Beth.

678
00:46:54,078 --> 00:46:55,878
Luke, come here.

679
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:00,416
Come here.

680
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,088
Beth?

681
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:13,429
Please, come here.

682
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,166
Beth.

683
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:26,909
Yes.

684
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:29,312
Yes.

685
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,602
What are you doing?

686
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:56,105
I don't know.
I thought I saw Bethany.

687
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:01,210
Bethany's tied up downstairs
in the living room.

688
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:03,613
No. Yeah, she is.

689
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,549
Are you okay?

690
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:08,150
Yeah.

691
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:15,224
<i>So what was your wife's</i>
<i>relationship with Michael?</i>

692
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:18,327
I understand they used to date?

693
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:21,631
I think you're swimming up the
wrong stream there, Dr. Woods.

694
00:48:21,633 --> 00:48:23,432
And what stream
would that be, Luke?

695
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:25,368
The one that says
my wife's a whore.

696
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:27,403
- Oh, I didn't say that.
- We're done here.

697
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,338
Okay, let's back it up.

698
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,340
What was the reason...

699
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,411
that you were spying
on him in his room?

700
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:39,181
I wasn't spying on him. I thought
I saw her go up the stairs.

701
00:48:39,183 --> 00:48:41,250
So you were jealous.

702
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,419
No.

703
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:46,656
Yes.

704
00:48:46,658 --> 00:48:49,358
Look, I was downstairs.

705
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,560
I went to the bathroom.

706
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:54,163
I could have sworn
I saw her go up the stairs.

707
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,499
Okay.

708
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,523
It's good to see you, Father.

709
00:49:20,525 --> 00:49:25,161
The, um... The bishop has
given me permission to, uh...

710
00:49:25,163 --> 00:49:29,699
to monitor the situation
in a more official capacity.

711
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:33,035
Where is everybody?

712
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:37,440
Inside. Come in.

713
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:48,117
So, Father, what now?

714
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:51,454
Well, for the church to allow
me to perform an exorcism,

715
00:49:51,456 --> 00:49:53,496
I need to show
a case of possession.

716
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,726
What are we looking for?

717
00:49:56,728 --> 00:50:00,162
Uh... Several things.

718
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:04,433
I mean, the church's list
is rather lengthy...

719
00:50:04,435 --> 00:50:06,469
for this sort of approval.

720
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:10,206
I mean, to begin with,
speaking in a foreign tongue.

721
00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:21,384
What did she say?

722
00:50:21,386 --> 00:50:23,085
It's Latin, right?

723
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:25,654
Are you kidding?
Bethany don't speak Latin.

724
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:31,694
It appears she does now.

725
00:50:34,565 --> 00:50:36,399
Yeah, you've proved
your point, spirit.

726
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:45,274
Yes.

727
00:50:45,276 --> 00:50:48,811
Let's do this. Your brother
died poorly, Father.

728
00:50:48,813 --> 00:50:51,814
You were in attendance
at his hour of death.

729
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:55,484
I was.

730
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:00,289
How did you know that?

731
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:02,391
I know these things.
Get used to it.

732
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:05,393
Do you remember what
he whispered to you?

733
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:09,131
I do.

734
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:11,700
The Catholics
still believe suicide...

735
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:15,104
to be an unforgivable sin.

736
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:17,506
Yes.

737
00:51:17,508 --> 00:51:20,342
So, tell me, Father,

738
00:51:20,344 --> 00:51:24,413
why, when he asked you
with his dying breath...

739
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:26,615
if he would go to hell,

740
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:28,684
did you tell him yes?

741
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:31,654
No, I am bound by the truth.

742
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:34,256
- And Jesus said that suicide...
- You're nothing like him.

743
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:36,525
Jesus was a carpenter. He was.

744
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:39,462
Yeah, and you just nailed
and screwed a lot, eh, Padre?

745
00:51:39,464 --> 00:51:41,597
The Lord will protect me
and the others...

746
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,699
and the girl that you've
so wrongfully entered.

747
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:45,601
Discard the girl's essence,

748
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,570
hide behind insanity
where they'll never find it.

749
00:51:47,572 --> 00:51:49,338
You've no control here.

750
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,140
Oh, really?

751
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:54,577
Father, do something!

752
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:58,280
Help, help, help! Untie her!

753
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:00,516
Please help. Please help.

754
00:52:00,518 --> 00:52:03,219
Shh, shh. It's okay. Bethany.

755
00:52:03,221 --> 00:52:06,155
Shh, shh. It's okay.

756
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:10,359
You die, Father.

757
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:58,407
Is it gonna stop that?

758
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,845
It seems to be
gathering strength.

759
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:13,355
It's trying to create fear.

760
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:15,391
Fear is our worst enemy.

761
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:21,761
And then we must pray and wait
for this demon to show its hand.

762
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,577
An even better reason
for us to take our time.

763
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:37,713
Can't you just please
do something?

764
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,782
We can't take this anymore.

765
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:44,987
Look, how will we know
what it wants?

766
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:48,524
Maybe... Maybe it's a test,
like Job or something.

767
00:53:48,526 --> 00:53:51,327
Job? What the hell is Job?

768
00:53:51,329 --> 00:53:55,798
Satan challenged God by saying
that Job only praised him...

769
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,500
because of all the gifts
that God has given him.

770
00:53:58,502 --> 00:54:01,637
So God told Satan...

771
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:06,575
that he could test Job's
faith in any way he wished,

772
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:08,937
provided he didn't kill him.

773
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,583
So the devil responds by, um,
taking away Job's family,

774
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:19,655
destroying his crops,

775
00:54:19,657 --> 00:54:23,292
slaying his cattle, turning
his friends against him.

776
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:28,030
But instead of turning away
from the Lord,

777
00:54:28,032 --> 00:54:30,266
as the devil hoped,

778
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:33,869
he asked for forgiveness
of his sins.

779
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:39,008
He not only prayed
for his own sins...

780
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:41,877
but for the sins of his sons,

781
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:43,812
never once doubting
his faith...

782
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:47,716
and thus proving
the devil wrong.

783
00:54:47,718 --> 00:54:51,287
Can God give permission to the devil
to annihilate someone's life?

784
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:55,424
That's fucked up.

785
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:13,876
Yeah, this place has got
some seriously bad energy.

786
00:55:13,878 --> 00:55:17,398
But something told me I should come back.
Plus, I missed you guys.

787
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,650
Hannah.

788
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:31,527
Oh, I see you brought
in the God squad.

789
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:33,095
Greetings, Padre.

790
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:35,731
Um, it's Father Patrick.

791
00:55:35,733 --> 00:55:37,766
Samara. The psychic.

792
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:41,370
Uh, yes.

793
00:55:41,372 --> 00:55:43,872
- Interesting.
- Thank you.

794
00:55:43,874 --> 00:55:45,708
I would have chosen
"mysterious" and "beautiful,"

795
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:47,843
but "interesting's" good.

796
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:50,079
So, how's our little
demon doing today?

797
00:55:50,081 --> 00:55:53,716
Ha-ha. My puppet on a string.

798
00:55:53,718 --> 00:55:55,551
Are you flirting with me?

799
00:55:55,553 --> 00:55:58,821
Those voices you hear, your
so-called guardian angels,

800
00:55:58,823 --> 00:56:00,622
do you know them very well?

801
00:56:00,624 --> 00:56:02,825
You can't tell the
difference between them...

802
00:56:02,827 --> 00:56:05,728
and me.

803
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:08,097
Why don't you go back to sticking
your fingers down your throat?

804
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:10,766
You can't save her and
she's not worth dying for.

805
00:56:10,768 --> 00:56:12,888
Yeah, well, I'll be
the judge of that.

806
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:16,605
Because you can't be
everywhere all at once,

807
00:56:16,607 --> 00:56:18,107
my sassy little spirit.

808
00:56:18,109 --> 00:56:20,409
And right now,
may I remind you,

809
00:56:20,411 --> 00:56:22,144
you are cowering
behind a lady, dude.

810
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:24,680
Suck my dick, fatty.
Whip it out, bitch.

811
00:56:24,682 --> 00:56:26,548
Sit on my lap.

812
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,617
It's a waste of time. We
should all be preparing.

813
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:30,919
And then I'll show you.

814
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:48,670
<i>Mommy, I'm scared.</i>

815
00:56:48,672 --> 00:56:51,140
<i>I don't wanna be alone.</i>

816
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:03,819
<i>Help me. Please.</i>

817
00:57:03,821 --> 00:57:05,521
<i>Come with me, Mommy.</i>

818
00:57:05,523 --> 00:57:07,623
<i>I'm too scared to be by myself.</i>

819
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:09,625
Hannah.

820
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,161
Hannah.

821
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:16,165
We all need
to be here together...

822
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:20,928
if we're to save
your sister's soul.

823
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:26,575
I just want her to forgive me.

824
00:57:26,577 --> 00:57:28,977
We must all ask
for forgiveness.

825
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:32,981
Each of us.

826
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:36,151
Priests included.

827
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:41,056
You also have a husband...

828
00:57:41,058 --> 00:57:42,791
who needs your love
and prayers.

829
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:47,029
Will that be enough?

830
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:52,034
Don't underestimate
yourself, Hannah.

831
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:58,640
More candles,
um, some matches...

832
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:00,108
and most likely more duct tape.

833
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:02,044
Well, I can get candles
and matches.

834
00:58:02,046 --> 00:58:05,814
The duct tape
is down in the basement.

835
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:07,916
Where in the basement?
I'll get it.

836
00:58:07,918 --> 00:58:11,086
Uh, it's on the shelves.
There's a whole bunch of it.

837
00:58:11,088 --> 00:58:13,255
You shouldn't go alone. I
should probably accompany you.

838
00:58:13,257 --> 00:58:16,225
Oh, that's sweet, Father.

839
00:58:16,227 --> 00:58:18,527
But I'm a big girl.
I think I can manage.

840
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:22,831
After you're done here,
can you go check on her?

841
00:59:38,042 --> 00:59:39,875
Seriously, don't!

842
00:59:39,877 --> 00:59:41,643
What the hell is
the matter with you?

843
00:59:41,645 --> 00:59:43,745
I almost had
a freakin' heart attack.

844
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:45,781
- You scared the shit out of me!
- Is everything okay?

845
00:59:45,783 --> 00:59:47,683
Luke just scared
the shit out of me.

846
00:59:47,685 --> 00:59:50,118
Are we gonna stand here all night
or are we actually gonna do this?

847
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,154
We're ready, as soon as Samara
gets back with the duct tape...

848
00:59:52,156 --> 00:59:53,755
That's outside.

849
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:55,123
Come on.

850
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:31,960
Oh, my God.

851
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:41,937
Oh, my God.

852
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:47,943
Come on. Let's get back.

853
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:55,150
It's a party. How'd you like
my little human piñata?

854
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:56,852
Why did you do that to her?

855
01:00:58,254 --> 01:01:00,255
No, no, Maggie! No!

856
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:02,758
"Our Father, who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name.

857
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,360
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven."

858
01:01:05,362 --> 01:01:09,998
What do you want from us?

859
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:14,903
Get away from her!

860
01:01:14,905 --> 01:01:17,205
Oh, my God, I don't wanna die.

861
01:01:17,207 --> 01:01:19,741
You're not gonna die.
It's gonna be okay.

862
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,410
It's gonna be okay.

863
01:01:38,896 --> 01:01:41,329
Dumb bitch, she's my whore.

864
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:47,769
"I exorcise thee
and all unclean spirits..."

865
01:01:47,771 --> 01:01:50,005
in the name of God
the Father Almighty,

866
01:01:50,007 --> 01:01:52,741
and in the name of Jesus Christ,
his son, our Lord and judge,

867
01:01:52,743 --> 01:01:54,309
and in the power
of the Holy Spirit,

868
01:01:54,311 --> 01:01:56,912
that thou depart from this
creature of God, Bethany,

869
01:01:56,914 --> 01:01:59,181
that it may be made
the temple of the living God,

870
01:01:59,183 --> 01:02:01,183
through the same
Christ our Lord,

871
01:02:01,185 --> 01:02:03,418
"who shall come to judge the living
and the dead and the world of fire."

872
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:05,454
May God rise up
and dissipate his enemies.

873
01:02:05,456 --> 01:02:07,489
May God rise up and
dissipate his enemies.

874
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:09,925
May God rise up
and dissipate his enemies.

875
01:02:09,927 --> 01:02:11,860
May God rise up and
dissipate his enemies.

876
01:02:11,862 --> 01:02:13,862
The power of Christ
compels you!

877
01:02:13,864 --> 01:02:15,797
The power
of Christ compels you!

878
01:02:15,799 --> 01:02:18,233
The power of Christ
compels you!

879
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:20,802
How about "let the power
of Christ compelling"...

880
01:02:20,804 --> 01:02:25,173
comes after my head spins around
and I masturbate with a crucifix?

881
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:28,176
Now I've weakened you,
demon, I can tell.

882
01:02:28,178 --> 01:02:30,212
I weakened you more, Father.

883
01:02:30,214 --> 01:02:31,780
Ah!

884
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,951
Oh, God, no! No!

885
01:02:35,953 --> 01:02:37,519
What's the matter?

886
01:02:37,521 --> 01:02:40,222
Little naked man on a stick
too hot for you?

887
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:52,334
I'm sorry.

888
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:55,403
Bethany, I'm so sorry.

889
01:02:57,173 --> 01:03:01,510
If you would only
come out to stop this,

890
01:03:01,512 --> 01:03:05,547
I promise I will
never lie to you again.

891
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:10,352
Never lie?

892
01:03:10,354 --> 01:03:13,188
Well, I'll do a deal
with you, Luke.

893
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:16,258
Please tell Bethany.
Tell her about Christine.

894
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,300
Tell her about
your little accident.

895
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:21,530
I'll let her go.

896
01:03:21,532 --> 01:03:23,165
Don't listen, Luke.

897
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:24,800
It's just trying
to exhaust you.

898
01:03:24,802 --> 01:03:26,835
Shut up, choir boy!

899
01:03:26,837 --> 01:03:28,912
It won't let her go,
no matter what you say.

900
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:29,583
- Father!

901
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:32,908
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

902
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:35,977
Tell her the truth, Luke.

903
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:38,346
I'll let her go.
Come on, come on.

904
01:03:38,348 --> 01:03:40,028
And why is
that interesting, demon?

905
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:44,986
Because it'll condemn
his spirit to hell.

906
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:47,122
What'll it be, cowboy?

907
01:03:47,124 --> 01:03:49,891
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

908
01:03:49,893 --> 01:03:53,161
Tell Bethany. I'll let her go.

909
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:57,132
Okay. Okay. I'll tell her.

910
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:00,168
I'll tell her.

911
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:07,309
What...

912
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:10,579
Luke? Beth.

913
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:17,085
Baby, please. Sweetheart.

914
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:20,388
Why am I here? Baby.

915
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:23,859
Wh... Wait. Tell me what?
Tell me what?

916
01:04:23,861 --> 01:04:27,495
Sweetheart, you know how...

917
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:31,266
Well, do you remember
one night last year...

918
01:04:31,268 --> 01:04:33,435
I got home so late? Yeah.

919
01:04:33,437 --> 01:04:36,438
And I told you I hit
something on the road?

920
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:40,275
Yeah. Um, you-you hit a deer.

921
01:04:40,277 --> 01:04:42,210
Y...

922
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:45,313
You hit a deer. Yeah?

923
01:04:50,286 --> 01:04:52,287
What did you do?

924
01:04:52,289 --> 01:04:53,989
Uh...

925
01:04:53,991 --> 01:04:55,557
Oh, baby.

926
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:59,261
Baby, I-I-I-I gave up
drinking, remember?

927
01:04:59,263 --> 01:05:04,332
And the reason why is because
that night, I-I was drunk,

928
01:05:04,334 --> 01:05:07,636
and it was raining
so, so heavily.

929
01:05:07,638 --> 01:05:09,237
Baby...

930
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:13,241
I didn't hurt a deer.

931
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,343
What did you do?
What did you do?

932
01:05:15,345 --> 01:05:18,280
What did you do?

933
01:05:18,282 --> 01:05:20,515
What did you do?

934
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:26,221
I can't do this.

935
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,390
Please, God.

936
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:32,227
Fail, loser. Boring.

937
01:05:32,229 --> 01:05:35,130
Luke didn't hit a deer.

938
01:05:35,132 --> 01:05:37,032
Luke hit a woman with his car.

939
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:39,634
He was too much of a
coward to help her...

940
01:05:39,636 --> 01:05:43,438
because her jaw was
three feet from her face.

941
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,607
No.

942
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:47,475
Coward.

943
01:05:47,477 --> 01:05:49,277
Luke.

944
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:52,113
Is it true?

945
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:54,015
It was, uh...

946
01:05:54,017 --> 01:05:56,551
I don't... It's not the way...

947
01:05:57,987 --> 01:05:59,721
It was an accident.
I didn't fucking mean it.

948
01:05:59,723 --> 01:06:02,190
I didn't fucking mean it!

949
01:06:02,192 --> 01:06:04,726
I didn't fucking mean it!

950
01:06:04,728 --> 01:06:06,728
Hannah, take Luke upstairs.

951
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:13,568
I'll make a deal
with you, Maggie.

952
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:17,639
Tell us what <i>you</i> want, hmm?

953
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:20,709
Ah. I'll let her go.

954
01:06:20,711 --> 01:06:24,412
Shut the fuck up. I bargain with no demon.
I've done nothing wrong.

955
01:06:24,414 --> 01:06:28,416
You can't have him. He's not
gonna leave God for you.

956
01:06:28,418 --> 01:06:30,385
I know what makes you tick.

957
01:06:30,387 --> 01:06:33,154
Ticktock.

958
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:35,657
Ticktock.

959
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:39,260
Maggie wants the padre's cock.

960
01:06:39,262 --> 01:06:40,782
Shut up! I'll kill you!

961
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:50,005
Oh, my God.

962
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:54,209
Just make sure
she doesn't escape.

963
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:57,612
I'm so sorry, Father.

964
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:01,616
I was never going
to do anything, I swear.

965
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:07,489
Sometimes...

966
01:07:07,491 --> 01:07:11,226
God and the devil, they...
they test our strength.

967
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,230
And they come in many forms.

968
01:07:15,232 --> 01:07:17,599
I don't wanna be tested.

969
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:21,269
I...

970
01:07:21,271 --> 01:07:23,238
I just want you.

971
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:27,475
Please, please, leave this.
Leave with me.

972
01:07:27,477 --> 01:07:30,378
They don't care. They don't
deserve to be saved.

973
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,647
Can't you see that?

974
01:07:32,649 --> 01:07:34,449
No.

975
01:07:34,451 --> 01:07:37,371
Jesus died for the
forgiveness of sins.

976
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:41,556
I can't turn my back on them.
My faith won't allow it.

977
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:47,762
God, what am I... Fuck!

978
01:07:47,764 --> 01:07:49,631
What am I saying?

979
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:55,637
I can't believe I wanna
abandon my friends.

980
01:07:55,639 --> 01:07:59,374
No, no. Maggie, Maggie,
you've done nothing wrong.

981
01:07:59,376 --> 01:08:01,309
I am so afraid.

982
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:05,780
Please help me.

983
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:07,449
Please.

984
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:33,775
I'm so sorry.

985
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:37,779
I can't. I can't.

986
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:40,215
I can't give in to temptation.

987
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:45,220
I refuse to let the devil win.

988
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,594
Father!

989
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:56,564
Father! Help!

990
01:08:56,566 --> 01:08:58,266
Please, somebody help!

991
01:08:58,268 --> 01:09:00,335
Someone help me!

992
01:09:00,337 --> 01:09:02,470
Padre!

993
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:03,872
Come on.

994
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,478
Father.

995
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:13,515
Father?

996
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:20,555
He's dead, he's dead.

997
01:09:20,557 --> 01:09:22,724
He's dead!

998
01:09:22,726 --> 01:09:25,793
He's dead.
God love him. He's dead.

999
01:09:30,933 --> 01:09:34,602
Really? He rejected you, Maggie.
You should be thanking me.

1000
01:09:34,604 --> 01:09:36,638
Good. You're all here.

1001
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:40,875
I like it when I can see
the death in your faces.

1002
01:09:40,877 --> 01:09:43,311
I'm calling the police now.
With what?

1003
01:09:43,313 --> 01:09:45,180
Two yogurt cups
and a piece of string?

1004
01:09:45,182 --> 01:09:47,348
It's not working.
Why isn't it working?

1005
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:49,217
None of your phones work,
you stupid bitch.

1006
01:09:49,219 --> 01:09:51,186
Who are you gonna call,
your mom?

1007
01:09:51,188 --> 01:09:52,787
She won't answer.

1008
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:55,790
What do you want?

1009
01:09:55,792 --> 01:09:57,392
I just wanna play.

1010
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:03,198
If you wanna kill us,

1011
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,567
please, just kill us now.

1012
01:10:05,569 --> 01:10:07,669
That's no fun.

1013
01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:11,272
I am done playing.

1014
01:10:11,274 --> 01:10:13,541
Watch this.

1015
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:20,815
Oh, my God.

1016
01:10:23,352 --> 01:10:25,620
Oh, God!

1017
01:10:25,622 --> 01:10:30,325
Oh, God! Somebody help me!
Oh, help me!

1018
01:10:30,327 --> 01:10:33,561
- What do you think of that, Michael?
- She deserves it.

1019
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:35,603
Just fucking stop.
Stop! You're killing her!

1020
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:40,301
Michael, for God's sake!

1021
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:46,274
I know what you want.
I'll do it.

1022
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:48,810
I'll give you my faith.

1023
01:10:48,812 --> 01:10:50,845
Oh, Michael!

1024
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:56,417
I'll even kill her myself,
if you want me to.

1025
01:10:56,419 --> 01:10:58,586
Do it for me, Daddy.

1026
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:00,888
- Michael! Michael!
- Michael, you don't want this!

1027
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:02,757
Yes, I do.

1028
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:07,328
Michael. Michael.

1029
01:11:08,797 --> 01:11:10,531
- Move.
- Please!

1030
01:11:10,533 --> 01:11:12,533
Michael, please stop!
Move. Move. Move.

1031
01:11:12,535 --> 01:11:15,703
What's wrong with you? You
got a kitten in your purse?

1032
01:11:15,705 --> 01:11:17,272
Drop these losers!

1033
01:11:17,274 --> 01:11:19,474
Michael, no!

1034
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:37,725
No. No!

1035
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:41,362
Bethany, listen to me.
I know you can hear me.

1036
01:11:41,364 --> 01:11:44,065
You have to save us. Bethany!

1037
01:11:44,067 --> 01:11:46,334
Feels good.

1038
01:11:46,336 --> 01:11:49,637
I hadn't stretched in a while.

1039
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:52,540
Hit me.

1040
01:11:52,542 --> 01:11:55,376
I do so beg of you.

1041
01:11:55,378 --> 01:11:56,878
Boo!

1042
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,546
Bethany, I need you.

1043
01:11:58,548 --> 01:12:00,782
Stop it!

1044
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:04,552
Help me.

1045
01:12:04,554 --> 01:12:06,020
Help me.

1046
01:12:06,022 --> 01:12:07,622
Please.

1047
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:11,092
You can help me.
Please, please.

1048
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:18,099
Shut up, bitch!
Come back where you belong.

1049
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:31,579
I grew up with sinners.

1050
01:12:31,581 --> 01:12:36,684
And not one of you
would turn to God for help.

1051
01:12:38,487 --> 01:12:41,055
Not one of you had faith.

1052
01:12:41,057 --> 01:12:43,124
So here's your choice.

1053
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:48,796
Kill yourself...

1054
01:12:49,732 --> 01:12:51,599
and save your sister.

1055
01:12:51,601 --> 01:12:55,103
Sacrifice yourself for her,

1056
01:12:55,105 --> 01:12:58,840
or she dies and you live.

1057
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:00,908
You lie.

1058
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:02,910
You lie!

1059
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:07,515
Oh, ye of little faith.

1060
01:13:07,517 --> 01:13:09,650
How I adore thee.

1061
01:13:13,857 --> 01:13:17,058
Please. Please.
Please, God! Please!

1062
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:19,494
God? There's no God here.

1063
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:23,998
Now, what's your choice?

1064
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:31,139
Go on.

1065
01:13:31,141 --> 01:13:33,007
Do the right thing.

1066
01:13:35,144 --> 01:13:36,744
Do it.

1067
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,024
Do it, Hannah.

1068
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:56,798
Oh, please, God, I'm sorry.

1069
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,200
Please forgive me
for what I've done.

1070
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:07,608
Our Father, who art in heaven,

1071
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,210
hallowed be thy name,

1072
01:14:09,212 --> 01:14:11,746
thy kingdom come...
You're wasting your time!

1073
01:14:11,748 --> 01:14:13,781
Thy will be done,

1074
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:16,751
on earth as it is in heaven.

1075
01:14:16,753 --> 01:14:19,073
Give us this day
our daily bread...

1076
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:23,791
and forgive us
our trespasses...

1077
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:27,929
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1078
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:39,507
Satan, I forgive you.

1079
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:43,711
Hannah. Hannah, I love you.

1080
01:14:43,713 --> 01:14:47,081
Lead us not into temptation...

1081
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:50,051
but deliver us from evil.

1082
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:07,702
I was never here
to take your soul.

1083
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:10,705
I was here to save it.

1084
01:15:34,897 --> 01:15:36,297
Amen.

1085
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:46,307
Do you really think Bethany would
have stabbed herself in the chest?

1086
01:15:46,309 --> 01:15:49,076
<i>Or do you think it's more likely
Hannah would stab her sister...</i>

1087
01:15:49,078 --> 01:15:51,279
<i>because she suspected her</i>
<i>of sleeping with her husband?</i>

1088
01:15:51,281 --> 01:15:53,147
What do you think?

1089
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:58,219
Hannah came totally unhinged
over Emma's death...

1090
01:15:58,221 --> 01:16:00,021
<i>and felt threatened.</i>

1091
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:04,292
Once her family
knew her secret,

1092
01:16:04,294 --> 01:16:09,564
she would always be the woman whose
neglect caused the death of her baby.

1093
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:14,135
Where was Hannah
when her mother died?

1094
01:16:15,604 --> 01:16:17,071
What?

1095
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,473
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

1096
01:16:20,976 --> 01:16:23,210
<i>Jean left.</i>

1097
01:16:23,212 --> 01:16:25,246
Didn't she?

1098
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:27,782
She couldn't let her mother
leave the house.

1099
01:16:27,784 --> 01:16:30,585
Jean knew her secret,

1100
01:16:30,587 --> 01:16:33,287
and Hannah knew she'd
never keep it to herself.

1101
01:16:33,289 --> 01:16:35,623
Who made the drinks that night?

1102
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:39,193
<i>She could have given Bethany</i>
<i>any number of drugs.</i>

1103
01:16:39,195 --> 01:16:41,729
<i>Drugs that made her</i>
<i>as delusional...</i>

1104
01:16:41,731 --> 01:16:44,665
as Hannah needed her to be.

1105
01:16:44,667 --> 01:16:48,669
<i>Where was Hannah</i>
<i>when Samara was killed?</i>

1106
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,939
In Emma's room.

1107
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:54,342
Did you see her there?

1108
01:16:55,377 --> 01:16:57,244
No.

1109
01:16:58,180 --> 01:16:59,914
Then how do you know?

1110
01:16:59,916 --> 01:17:02,917
I saw. I-I was there.

1111
01:17:02,919 --> 01:17:07,655
I saw Bethany throw people
across the room.

1112
01:17:07,657 --> 01:17:11,097
And she knew things that no
one could have told her.

1113
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:14,895
So what makes more sense?

1114
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:18,132
A hallucination...

1115
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:22,803
or the devil
in the living room.

1116
01:17:26,341 --> 01:17:28,943
Okay.

1117
01:17:28,945 --> 01:17:32,213
This allows me to transcribe
what we've talked about.

1118
01:17:33,682 --> 01:17:35,149
Thank you for being
so cooperative.

1119
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:37,952
After you sign that,
you're free to go.

1120
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:43,190
Where are the others?

1121
01:17:43,192 --> 01:17:45,126
Well, they're next door.

1122
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:47,695
I'm not finished with them.

1123
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:58,372
You're wrong
about tonight, Doctor.

1124
01:17:59,941 --> 01:18:01,742
The devil was there.

1125
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:04,745
You'll see.

1126
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:09,221
I can't wait to see the look
on your face when you do.

1127
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:11,752
Go get some rest.

1128
01:18:23,098 --> 01:18:25,232
Hey, did you get everything
you needed from her?

1129
01:18:25,234 --> 01:18:28,469
Oh, yeah. I didn't need her.
She's been released.

1130
01:18:28,471 --> 01:18:30,838
Listen. I think you need to
talk to Luke one more time.

1131
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:34,775
He just mentioned something in the interrogation
room about a hit-and-run last September.

1132
01:18:34,777 --> 01:18:36,778
I don't know. I could
barely understand him.

1133
01:18:36,804 --> 01:18:37,712
I think we need you.

1134
01:18:37,714 --> 01:18:39,480
Just clean up
with a few more questions,

1135
01:18:39,482 --> 01:18:41,282
and don't let them go
until I tell you, okay?

1136
01:18:41,284 --> 01:18:43,017
All right, no problem.

1137
01:18:43,019 --> 01:18:44,919
Come get me if they
give you a hard time.

1138
01:18:44,921 --> 01:18:47,021
Oh. I'll take care of Hannah.

1139
01:18:47,023 --> 01:18:49,223
All right? Yep.

1140
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:08,042
<i>Oh, Neil,</i>
<i>the look on your face.</i>

1141
01:19:08,044 --> 01:19:10,311
<i>You think you've</i>
<i>figured it out, don't you?</i>

1142
01:19:10,313 --> 01:19:12,046
<i>If anyone can do it, I can.</i>

1143
01:19:12,048 --> 01:19:13,848
<i>They'd call it a miracle.</i>

1144
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:18,219
<i>People don't question</i>
<i>what Jesus did.</i>

1145
01:19:18,221 --> 01:19:19,887
<i>Even if you can't understand,</i>

1146
01:19:19,889 --> 01:19:22,209
<i>it doesn't mean</i>
<i>it didn't happen.</i>

1147
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:26,327
<i>Close your mouth, Neil.</i>
<i>It's not flattering.</i>

1148
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:29,263
<i>Much better.</i>

1149
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:31,832
<i>Come on. It's so easy.</i>

1150
01:19:31,834 --> 01:19:34,435
<i>Think. Do I have</i>
<i>to spell it out for you?</i>

1151
01:19:36,539 --> 01:19:39,473
<i>It's a test, Neil.</i>

1152
01:19:39,475 --> 01:19:42,143
<i>Like Job. Remember?</i>

1153
01:19:42,145 --> 01:19:44,979
<i>The priest was a surprise.</i>

1154
01:19:44,981 --> 01:19:48,249
<i>I didn't expect him to fall</i>
<i>for man's oldest desire.</i>

1155
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:51,185
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

1156
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,555
<i>The psychic</i>
<i>was a false prophet.</i>

1157
01:19:54,557 --> 01:19:58,092
<i>She was always destined</i>
<i>to be with me.</i>

1158
01:19:58,094 --> 01:20:01,162
<i>The real game was the test</i>
<i>for the others.</i>

1159
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:08,536
<i>Michael... a loving husband,</i>
<i>but a better adulterer...</i>

1160
01:20:08,538 --> 01:20:12,006
<i>his immorality led</i>
<i>to his own self-destruction.</i>

1161
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:15,910
<i>Luke the murderer.</i>

1162
01:20:15,912 --> 01:20:19,980
<i>Yes, he did confess in the end,</i>
<i>but just not to God.</i>

1163
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:21,515
<i>Hannah I cannot take.</i>

1164
01:20:21,517 --> 01:20:24,218
<i>She was the only one</i>
<i>to turn to him,</i>

1165
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:28,289
<i>and one day her soul will be
reunited with that of her daughter.</i>

1166
01:20:28,291 --> 01:20:31,192
<i>God can have them both...</i>
<i>Bethany too.</i>

1167
01:20:31,194 --> 01:20:33,394
<i>But as for her unborn child,</i>

1168
01:20:33,396 --> 01:20:35,830
<i>well, I can't tell you</i>
<i>everything.</i>

1169
01:20:35,832 --> 01:20:40,000
<i>I chose this family</i>
<i>after watching them for a while.</i>

1170
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:44,004
<i>I mean, between murderers and
adulterers, my odds were pretty high.</i>

1171
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:48,142
<i>It's more about watching people
fail than just taking their souls.</i>

1172
01:20:48,144 --> 01:20:51,345
<i>And you, Neil, pretending to
be the protector of truth,</i>

1173
01:20:51,347 --> 01:20:54,949
<i>but you forget</i>
<i>only God can judge.</i>

1174
01:20:54,951 --> 01:20:57,351
<i>You had all the evidence</i>
<i>in front of you,</i>

1175
01:20:57,353 --> 01:21:00,955
<i>and yet you've just condemned</i>
<i>an innocent woman.</i>

1176
01:21:00,957 --> 01:21:03,023
<i>Don't you see?</i>

1177
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:05,226
<i>You betrayed God.</i>

1178
01:21:05,228 --> 01:21:07,328
<i>It's time to go, Neil.</i>

1179
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:10,231
<i>Your soul's mine.</i>

1180
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:14,635
<i>All of you meet me</i>
<i>at least once.</i>

1181
01:21:14,637 --> 01:21:16,470
<i>I take many forms.</i>

1182
01:21:16,472 --> 01:21:20,941
<i>You can call me temptation, but I
am Lucifer, the light bringer.</i>

1183
01:21:20,943 --> 01:21:23,043
<i>I am Belial.</i>

1184
01:21:23,945 --> 01:21:26,146
<i>I am the morning star.</i>

1185
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:58,279
