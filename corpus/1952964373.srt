1
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,365
Where does it come from?

2
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:41,771
This quest, this need
to solve life's mysteries,

3
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:44,901
when the simplest of questions
can never be answered?

4
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:51,817
Why are we here? What is the soul?
Why do we dream?

5
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:57,279
Perhaps we'd be better off
not looking at all.

6
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,188
Not delving, not yearning.

7
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:05,464
That's not human nature.
Not the human heart.

8
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,232
That is not why we are here.

9
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,357
How's he doing?

10
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,922
- I'm sorry. Did I scare you?
- No.

11
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:43,733
No, I just... I keep having
these amazing dreams

12
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:46,101
every time I close my eyes and...

13
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:47,765
...never mind.

14
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,342
He likes me to read him the stock page.

15
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,137
Has he been conscious at all?

16
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,340
No.

17
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,910
Been a week now. I think he's close.

18
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,348
A couple more days, maybe.

19
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,047

20
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,719
You know I don't know
what he'd do without you.

21
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,989
- You got a real gift.
- Just doing my job.

22
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,725
No, you're like a son to him.

23
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,325
No, that would make us
like brother and sister.

24
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,698
Might be... might be a little awkward

25
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,203
if I ever wanted to ask you out.

26
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:25,140
I'm sorry, that was...
That was inappropriate.

27
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,338
No, it's sweet, it's...

28
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,472
I'm dating somebody.

29
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,847
Yeah. No, really, it's OK.

30
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,450
I need to change his IV.

31
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,748
I'm sorry, of course.

32
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,265
Man is a narcissistic species by nature.

33
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:51,135
We have colonized the four corners
of our tiny planet.

34
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:54,298
But we are not the pinnacle
of so-called evolution.

35
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,609
That honor belongs to the lowly cockroach.

36
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:02,271
They say that man uses only
a tenth of his brain power.

37
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:06,712
Another percent and we might actually
be worthy of God's image.

38
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:10,822
Unless, of course,
that day has already arrived.

39
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,649
The Human Genome Project
has discovered that tiny variations

40
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:19,562
in man's genetic code are taking place
at increasingly rapid rates.

41
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:23,424
Teleportation, levitation,
tissue regeneration.

42
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,801
Is this outside the realm of possibility?

43
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,171
Or is man entering a new gateway to evolution?

44
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:33,702
Is he finally standing at the threshold
to true human potential?

45
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,907
I'm sorry. I'm out of time.

46
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:48,225
I know, I know, I'm beginning to sound
like my father. I can't help it.

47
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,626
You know, they can fire me
too, if they like,

48
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:54,155
but there is something to it,
Nirad. As crazy as it sounds.

49
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,029
What is it?

50
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,696
It's your father.

51
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,039
He's dead.

52
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:06,906
How?

53
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,710
Driving a taxi in New York City
is a very dangerous job.

54
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,181
The wrong fare, the wrong time.

55
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,809
We may never know what really happened.

56
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,580
No, I spoke to him two days ago.

57
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:17,646
He was convinced someone was following
him, trying to steal his research.

58
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:18,884
He died because of his theories.

59
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,550
- That's crazy.
- Is it?

60
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,021
The man left his family,

61
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,259
discredited his career, to chase wild
theories halfway around the world.

62
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:27,390
Where are you going?

63
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,129
To his apartment, to get his papers,
his research.

64
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,330
He was this close
to finding the first of them.

65
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,999
His Patient Zero, he tracked him
to Queens, New York.

66
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,803
Mohinder, listen to me.

67
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,037
Your father was my
colleague and my friend.

68
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,740
A respected professor,
a brilliant geneticist.

69
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,805
But he had clearly
lost touch with reality.

70
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,441
I've followed in his footsteps.

71
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,076
My thesis is based on his research.

72
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,814
Yes, you always wanted his approval.

73
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,947
And now you're telling me
that it was all for nothing.

74
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,219
I'm telling you to let go.

75
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:57,286
I need to know why he died. I need to
know that it wasn't all for nothing.

76
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,826
And then I need to finish
what he started.

77
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:00,792

78
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,088
Hello?

79
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,632
Yeah, yeah, I'm at his place now.

80
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:11,528
No, no, no, he left everything behind
but his computer.

81
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,966
Research, the map.

82
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,941
Yeah, let's get a team in here
to bag and tag everything.

83
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,306

84
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,868
I gotta call you right back.

85
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,064

86
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,502

87
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,895
Pervert!

88
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,522
Time to get up, Micah.

89
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,658
Micah.

90
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,466
Micah!

91
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,702
Micah. Micah.

92
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:32,869
What?

93
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,779
Damn it, Micah, don't do that to me.

94
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,109
Do what?

95
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,946
Just you need to be
careful. All right?

96
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,320
And I don't want you talking to
any strangers, do you understand?

97
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,414
I'm just working on my computer.

98
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:49,124
The logic board was bad,
so I had to build a new one.

99
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,391
A new one...

100
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,860
Did anyone ever tell you you're the
smartest little man on the planet?

101
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,926
You do. All the time.

102
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,101
What's this?

103
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:07,006
It's a pinhole camera. It's for the eclipse.

104
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,405
The moon's gonna cover up the sun today.

105
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,677
We're supposed to look at it at school.

106
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:16,518
Speaking of which, you need to go
get ready. Can't be late. Not today.

107
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:19,352
Mom, I'm already dressed
and I've packed my own lunch.

108
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,325
That's what I've been doing this morning.

109
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,452
What about you?

110
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:24,428
Hey, don't get smart with me.

111
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,529
All right, I've been working to pay our bills.

112
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,464
Yeah, that's why they turned off our gas again?

113
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,126


114
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,595
Go grab your stuff and
wait by the back door, OK?

115
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,606
- Why?
- Just do it.

116
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:44,809
Mom, what's going on?

117
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,409
Never mind, just keep your voice down
and stay close to me.

118
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:48,817

119
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,086

120
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,773
Camera ready?

121
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,714
Yeah, almost! Hold on.

122
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:22,513
This looks like 70, 80 feet.
This is so unreal.

123
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:23,885
OK, I'm good!

124
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,523
OK. Oh my...

125
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:27,854

126
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,819
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Claire?

127
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,058
Oh, my God.

128
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,564

129
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,330
Claire!

130
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:56,612
This is Claire Bennet and
that was attempt number six.

131
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,981
You get out here, yes?

132
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,992
Yes, sorry. Thanks.

133
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,496
Mr. Linderman, I'm gonna have to call
you back in five minutes, OK?

134
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,590
Thank you.

135
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,067
I'm late. I've got a fundraiser and a
drinks meeting. What is it?

136
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:48,004
It happened two more times. Sometimes
I'm falling, sometimes I'm flying.

137
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,201
- Sometimes you're in 'em.
- I don't have time for this now.

138
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,039
They're not just dreams, Nathan.

139
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,271
Hold this.

140
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,607
I thought they'd go away, but they're not.

141
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,477
Jim, I need this back by 6:00, please. Thanks.

142
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,416
This morning when I got out of bed, my
foot hovered before it hit the ground.

143
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,918
Hovered. For a split second,

144
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,851
like I was... like I was floating.

145
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,883
I'm telling you, I think I can fly.

146
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,957
- These all are "Undecideds"?
- Mmm-hmm.

147
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:11,420
Tell you what, you think you can fly?

148
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,227
Why don't you jump off the Brooklyn Bridge?
See what happens.

149
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,700
Maybe I ought to start with something
a little lower first.

150
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,703
- Just like learning to walk.
- You're serious.

151
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:19,795
Oh, I'm serious.

152
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,669
You need to snap out of it, Peter.

153
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,766
Go see a doctor, get some drugs.

154
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,909
But do not pull a Roger Clinton
on me man,

155
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,275
I'm eight points down in the polls.

156
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,143
Look, this isn't about you, all right?

157
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,547
Look, something is happening to me,
and I have this feeling

158
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,482
that you're the only person
that's gonna understand this.

159
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,747
Why the hell would I understand that
you think you can fly?

160
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,187
Because you're my brother!

161
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,391
Mom, look, I can't talk right now. I've got...

162
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:43,450
What?

163
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,223
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

164
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,992
What'd she do now?

165
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,458
- She got arrested.
- Arrested for what?

166
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:51,696
Shoplifting.

167
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,301
I'm so depressed.

168
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,206
What? What are you talking about? Why?

169
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:04,205
I mean, I mean, besides the fact that it
was so gross that I almost fudged myself,

170
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,775
this is the single coolest thing to happen
to this town in like, 100 years.

171
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:10,287
Not if nobody finds out, it's not.

172
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,124
Why'd you want me to tape it?

173
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,750
I have my reasons.

174
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,456
I still can't believe you asked me.

175
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,657
You stopped talking to me
in like, 6th grade.

176
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,929
It's safer this way.

177
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,496
Why? 'Cause I'm not popular,

178
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,939
so no one would believe me even
if I did tell? Which I won't.

179
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,010
Something like that.

180
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,742
It's not like you're not gonna be
popular anymore.

181
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,805
Popular?

182
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,644
Who said anything about being popular?

183
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,914
My life as I know it is over, OK?

184
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,048
I've got the Bishop game
next week, SAT's in October,

185
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,888
homecoming's three weeks from today,
and I'm a freak show.

186
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,757
You're being a little
dramatic, don't you think?

187
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,854
No, I don't think.

188
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:54,524
I have busted, like, every bone in my body,

189
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,001
stabbed myself in the chest, I've shoved
a two-foot steel rod through my neck,

190
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,197
and I don't have a scratch on me.

191
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,740
What do you call that thing sticking out?

192
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,739
Great.

193
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:15,444
- Just give me the tape, OK?
- Sure.

194
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,721
I can give you a ride on my handlebars...

195
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,854
...if you want.

196
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,199
That's OK, I'll walk.

197
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,601

198
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:37,134
Look, thanks, OK?

199
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:41,003
I'll talk to you in front of people
at school tomorrow.

200
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,608
Promise.

201
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,413

202
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,202

203
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,001
- What do we have?
- Three clear.

204
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,011
- Give me a count.
- All clear.

205
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,612

206
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,981
How the hell did they know we were coming?

207
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:56,152
Railroad schedules from the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

208
00:15:56,221 --> 00:16:00,157
Routes for transporting
nuclear material. Right.

209
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:03,854
Not much else. Couple of notes here,
mostly Arabic.

210
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,428
Except for this.

211
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,324
"Odessa." What the hell
is this, a name?

212
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:12,666
Oh, it's a town in Texas. Odessa.

213
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,867
What's that?

214
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:19,610
You asked me what Odessa is. It's a town
in Texas. And a city in Russia, I think.

215
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,475
What are you talking about?

216
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:23,939

217
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,116
What do you think? CIA or FBI?

218
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,561
No, she's dressed too nice for FBI.

219
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:41,965
Saw the test scores got posted this morning.

220
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,996
Don't worry about it, man.
Not everybody's a test-taker.

221
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,702
Who wants to be on SWAT anyway?

222
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,470
Too dangerous.

223
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,709

224
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:00,440

225
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,789
You all right, man?

226
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,345
What're you doing here, son?

227
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:33,173
You're not authorized to be in here.
Wait a minute.

228
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,241
Shh!

229
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,958
Don't shoot. Don't... Don't shoot!

230
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,298
Now, the train is registered to the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

231
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:59,504
And there has been no official statement,
yet, as to what was in the car.

232
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,274
But judging by the amount
of security around here,

233
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:05,839
it's pretty clear it was
something very valuable.

234
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:11,652
Reporting live from Odessa, Texas,
I'm Laura Lancaster.

235
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,392

236
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:39,673

237
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,799
I want a lawyer.

238
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,276
You lead me to the rest of your cell,
I'll think about it.

239
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,835
Until then, no one knows you're here,

240
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,711
which means no one will know if you're not.

241
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:15,175
You found him, didn't you?
You found the engineer.

242
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,983
He's here in LA.
Where is he?

243
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,788
Where is he?

244
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:31,035
This is LAPD jurisdiction.
We need to take him into custody.

245
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,503
He stays here till I tell you he leaves.

246
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:35,763
Who's the engineer?

247
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,365
Amid Halebi.

248
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:40,673
Saudi national with a PhD
in Nuclear Physics.

249
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:44,738
Was 20th terrorist on 9/11, until
he didn't show up for the main event.

250
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,717
Turns out, he fell for an American girl
he'd met a few months earlier.

251
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:50,380
September 10th, 2001,
he went off the grid.

252
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,886
And they tracked him here?

253
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,288
He brought the girl back to bury her.

254
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,123
She died of cancer. Funeral was yesterday.

255
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,788
He's back on the grid.

256
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,658
Let's see if the Amazing
Karnack here has some answers.

257
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:02,791
Who is he?

258
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,234
Matthew Parkman. He's eight
years on the force,

259
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:09,070
no commendations, no disciplinary
issues. He's undistinguished so far.

260
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,678
You, come with me.

261
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:17,715
Help me understand. How did you know
he was in there?

262
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,484
I don't know. I don't. I just did.

263
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:25,887
If you know where the engineer is,
I think you better tell me.

264
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,620
- The what?
- You recognize these?

265
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,918
Switching codes for rail transport.

266
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,987
Top secret Nuclear Regulatory routes.

267
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,129
Nuclear material, nuclear devices.

268
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,601
Meaning: anyone with these codes
could wreak a lot of havoc

269
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,935
if they decided to send two trains
down the same rail line.

270
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:47,172
But you don't know anything
about that, do you?

271
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,473
No, ma'am.

272
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:55,481
I see in your file here
that you've taken the exam

273
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,216
to advance to the SWAT team three times.
- Yes, sir.

274
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,259
You realize that there are
physical requirements.

275
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:03,950
I can...

276
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,719
I can lose the weight.

277
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,059
How does that make you feel, son?

278
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,566
Flunking that test that many times?

279
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,792
...Embarrassed.

280
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,667
I guess... angry.

281
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,069
Angry enough to do something about it?

282
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:18,473
Take revenge in some kind of way?

283
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:19,771
You think I have something
to do with this guy?

284
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,245
- Do you?
- I'm telling you the truth. I...

285
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,013
I heard his voice.

286
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,942
Do you have some place you gotta be?

287
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,818
It's my wife, yes. I have a meeting...

288
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:31,913
At a what?

289
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,514
At a therapy session.

290
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,825
It's couples counseling. We're...

291
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,891
We're having some trouble at home.

292
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,660
<i>This guy's worthless.</i>

293
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,870
Yeah, I was real sorry
to hear about your father.

294
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,372
He seemed like a good guy.

295
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:55,869
Man, I thought I was a slob.

296
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,572
They were here, too.

297
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,378
- What?
- Nothing.

298
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,249
I got a guy who can clean this
up for 100 bucks.

299
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,585
No. It's all right. I'll take it as it is.

300
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,146
We rent by the week.

301
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,587
I'm gonna need to know you can afford it.

302
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,854
I have a job.

303
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,054
Doing what?

304
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,857
Driving a taxi.

305
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,632
I'll get you an application.

306
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,647

307
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:24,858

308
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:34,839

309
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:11,448

310
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:35,229
Your son is a very intelligent boy.

311
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,773
Gifted, actually. That's not the issue.

312
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,909
His father's not around,

313
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:44,779
and sometimes I think he could use
a bit of a stronger hand, you know?

314
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:48,016
I work nights a lot,

315
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:49,883
but we can both work harder.

316
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,923
It's not about the work.

317
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,858
The truth is, I just don't know
if this school is the right fit for him.

318
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:57,451
But he's made friends.

319
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:58,587
I'm sorry.

320
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,256
- He's on the soccer team.
- I'm sorry.

321
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,631
I wrote a check for $25,000

322
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,499
to get him into this snob fest.

323
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,700
I was told that that's what it took.

324
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,399
That's on top of the tuition.

325
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:13,433
About the tuition. Your last
three checks have bounced.

326
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,343
Fine, take it out of the 25 grand
that I gave you.

327
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,576
That was a donation. And it was
very appreciated.

328
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,881
Well, I want my money back.

329
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,387
I want my money back, now.

330
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,582
That money went to the capital
campaign for the new wing.

331
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,454
- It's already been spent.
- Then unspend it.

332
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,618
I'm sorry.

333
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,626
We could maybe discuss an extension
of the money that you owe, but...

334
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,229
I want my money back.

335
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,994
That's not possible.

336
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:45,967
Come on, baby, let's get out of here.

337
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,512
You're too good for this lousy school.

338
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:53,973
Mom?

339
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,453
Leave me alone.

340
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,555
For God's sake, Ma.

341
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:08,662
Are you OK?

342
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,825
They dropped the charges.

343
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,732
I have to fill out a form. No big deal.

344
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:12,963
No big deal? I'm running for Congress.

345
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:14,699
Do you have any idea
what this is gonna do to me

346
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,400
if it gets out, with our family's past?

347
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:19,875
What could you possibly need so bad
that you had to steal it?

348
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:21,173
Never mind, I don't wanna know.

349
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,941
- Socks.
- Socks?

350
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,280
Dad left you a fortune. What are
you thinking?

351
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,343
You know, it's been one ridiculous
stunt after another with you

352
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,356
for the last six months. Dad's gone,
just get over it.

353
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,686
You know what? Leave her alone.

354
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,055
She's OK, that's all that matters.

355
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:37,754
Thank God Mom's fine. She's a
criminal, but thank God she's OK.

356
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:40,798
Next thing you know she's gonna be
telling us she's a crack whore.

357
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:43,026
I gotta keep this out of the press.

358
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,300
You know what? Just get out of here.

359
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,962
Go worry about your image,
I'll handle this.

360
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,768
Yeah. Good. I gotta make sure
this stays buried.

361
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,468
- Thanks a lot, Mom.
- Mmm-hmm.

362
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,743
What were you thinking?

363
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,852
I just wanted to feel alive again.

364
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,857
Nathan only cares about himself.

365
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:13,557
Your father was the same way.
Alpha dogs, both of them.

366
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:17,400
You, in the meantime,
for all your selflessness,

367
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,199
and sitting with dying people...

368
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,632
What? You're gonna retire on what you make?

369
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:25,335
Maybe I'll shoplift my socks.

370
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,672
Don't get smart.

371
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,646
When you put everyone else
first, you end up last.

372
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:32,205
You always put Nathan first,
he took advantage.

373
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:35,616
Yeah, it wasn't you that was just
pushing him right out in front of me?

374
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,712
He takes up more space than you.

375
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,120
Demanded more attention.

376
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:41,548
And besides, it's not my fault,
you allowed it.

377
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,457
He's my brother. I love him.

378
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,728
Love is overrated.

379
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:48,458
He loves me, too. I know him.

380
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,994
We've always been close.

381
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,330
Rose-colored glasses.

382
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:52,893
That's cruel, Mom.

383
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:57,302
Look, since Dad died, I know you've
been feeling free to speak your mind,

384
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,811
but it wouldn't hurt to edit
yourself, every once in a while.

385
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:02,972
I'm sorry if the truth hurts.

386
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:07,181
I'm just saying you hero-worshipped him.

387
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,152
And those feelings were never returned.

388
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,485
You're wrong. It's biological,
and I can't help it, we're...

389
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,958
...we're connected.

390
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:22,864
I never told you this, but when
Nathan had his accident,

391
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,763
I knew it.

392
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,030
We all got the same call.

393
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,628
No, I'm saying before the call,

394
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,470
like he was telling me, 300 miles away.

395
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:34,000
I woke up, and I knew that he'd been hurt.

396
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:44,682
I hate it here. She doesn't even
have any books to read.

397
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:45,882
Baby, I'll be right back,

398
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:47,390
I'm just gonna go and
pack up a few things.

399
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,586
We should really go see Dad.

400
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:51,519
What good would that do?

401
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:52,585
He could help.

402
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,495
He should know that
someone's trying to hurt us.

403
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,797
Your dad's not in any position
to help us right now.

404
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,970
Look, I made some mistakes,
I admit it.

405
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,631
Mom, what'd you do?

406
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:10,443
Hey. I need you to know that I would
never let anything happen to you.

407
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,077
I promise.

408
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:15,619
Mom, why'd you look at yourself
like that in the fish tank?

409
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,087

410
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:26,323
- How long?
- Just a couple hours, tops.

411
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:28,831
There's some ice cream in the fridge.

412
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,597
Go ahead.

413
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:36,669
- What happened?
- I went to see Linderman.

414
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,641
- How much?
- Thirty.

415
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,308
You gambling again?

416
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:41,936
No, it's just bills.

417
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,373
And I used the rest to get Micah
into private school.

418
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:48,078
They didn't know what to do with him
at public, and I just...

419
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,745
I needed them to think
that we had money.

420
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:52,416
From the mob?

421
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:54,819
Hell, Niki.

422
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:56,691
You weren't born yesterday.

423
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,353
I'm just two weeks overdue.

424
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,693
I mean, I thought that I could
handle it, OK? It's just...

425
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:04,223
- I'm under a lot of stress right now, OK?
- Gee, I wonder why?

426
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,600
I feel like I'm kind of losing it a little bit.

427
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,271
I'm seeing things.

428
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,065
Like?

429
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,975
Like I keep feeling like
someone's watching me.

430
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:18,277
Yeah, Linderman wants his money back,

431
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,874
so he sends some mouth-breather
that's gonna put you in the hospital.

432
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,920
No, it is someone else.

433
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,185
It's someone that I can't see.

434
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,716
Does this make any sense to you?

435
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,321
No.

436
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,095
I'm sorry, you know what?

437
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,194
But I'll tell you what does...

438
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:41,329
I shouldn't be telling you this.

439
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:42,964
No, no, let me tell you
what does make sense.

440
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:46,875
You need to come up with that 30
grand plus interest, now.

441
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,537
Or you gotta run.

442
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:51,240
Watch him.

443
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:54,476
All right.

444
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,469
Hiro.

445
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,030

446
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,557
Cool, huh?

447
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,491
How hot do you think it is in there?

448
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,665
Turn on the camera.

449
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:06,239
Scotty! Scotty! Come on!

450
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:17,127
Take it easy, you're all right!
I'm OK, I'm fine!

451
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,327
Take it easy.

452
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,961
There's no burns.

453
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:28,834
Get going!

454
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:42,986
One, two, three, four, five, go.

455
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,547
One, two, three...

456
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,593

457
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:00,636
I missed you, Amid.

458
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:04,069
Our bond is too strong
to be broken by a woman.

459
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,707
We are bound by our beliefs.

460
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,543
I don't believe in anything anymore.

461
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,782
We trained together, we prayed together,

462
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:17,412
went on haj together, we're still brothers.

463
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,950
You flatter yourself.

464
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:21,992
Everything you planned is coming to pass.

465
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:25,121
The computer virus got us
the NRC switching codes.

466
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,196
It's all happening right now.

467
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,430
We derailed the train
in West Texas two hours ago.

468
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,902
We have the device. When we get
the plutonium,

469
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:36,269
we'll meet up in Idaho next month.

470
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:40,142
We just need you to assemble it.

471
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,443
What makes you think I would do that?

472
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:49,213
We started this together,
we need to finish it together.

473
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:53,323
Allah forgives you, so do I.

474
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,492
We can't do this without you.

475
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,165
It's because of her, isn't it?

476
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:12,739
I killed someone I loved.
I killed my own wife.

477
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,745
I will not kill anyone else.

478
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,619
What are you talking about?
She died of cancer.

479
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,978
I read the obituary.

480
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,415
When they bombed our camp in Pakistan,

481
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:30,484
you and I buried 20 children that day.

482
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,529
We dug their graves with our own hands.

483
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:37,761
Put flowers on them, cried, said prayers.

484
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:43,102
Just because you found love, doesn't
make the rest of the world stop suffering.

485
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:47,408
People don't respond to love.
They respond to action.

486
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:08,490
I'm sorry!

487
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,529
There was a big bust this morning.

488
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,330
Can we still make it?

489
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:16,464
Sure. Six minutes ought to be plenty
of time to face our marital problems.

490
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,433
And you're the one that
wanted to do this, remember?

491
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,977
No, I wanted this for us, OK?

492
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:22,376
You're unhappy, that's a problem.

493
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:23,970
Oh, right, it's my fault.

494
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,243
No, I didn't mean that.

495
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:32,854
I didn't pass. Again.

496
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,419
If you think that makes
a difference to me, then...

497
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,654
I never put any pressure
on you to move up.

498
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:41,720
I don't care.

499
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,697
I just want you to be happy for once.

500
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:44,928
I want to be where the action is.

501
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:48,028
I've told you this. I'm not
gonna retire a beat cop.

502
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,605
People get their dreams, why can't I?

503
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,371
We've been together 11 years, Matt.

504
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:54,570
I've made my dreams come true.

505
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,943
How long are we supposed to wait for yours?

506
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,447
Why don't you just tell them the truth?

507
00:36:58,516 --> 00:36:59,881
Yeah, that's a great idea.

508
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,213
I'll just walk in there and tell them

509
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:02,582
I can barely read.

510
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,052
I mean, half the words I see backwards,

511
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,247
the other half I can't even see...

512
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,518
Lots of people have dyslexia, Matt.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

513
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,583
I'm under so much stress
right now, honey, you've no idea.

514
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,150
Yeah, well, so am I.

515
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,831
Actually, I think there's something
wrong with my ears, my hearing.

516
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,025
Well then, go to a doctor.

517
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,125
No, honey, listen to me.

518
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:23,797
I'm hearing, like, voices in my head.

519
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:27,474
Like a crazy person... telling you what to do?

520
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:30,309
No, no, it's more like thoughts.

521
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,474
I'm hearing people's thoughts.

522
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,451
You know what, Matt, I have to go, OK?

523
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,046
I'll see you at home.

524
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:38,713
No. Please, listen to me.

525
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:42,651
- This is...
<i>- I can't stand it anymore.
You suffocate me.</i>

526
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,395
What are you doing?

527
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:49,150
<i>Hello? It is 2:30 in the
morning. Who is this?</i>

528
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,489
<i>You've been looking for me.</i>

529
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,125
<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

530
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,829
<i>Thank you for returning
my call, Mr. Sylar.</i>

531
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,999
<i>How did you find me?</i>

532
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,166
Mr. Sylar? Anyone there?

533
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,007
<i>Using the Human Genome Project,</i>

534
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,880
<i>I created an algorithm that mapped
and traced chromosome changes in...</i>

535
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:16,351
<i>It's very complex to describe in layman's terms.</i>

536
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,982
<i>I'm sure you have lots of questions.</i>

537
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:20,250
<i>Oh, I have questions,</i>

538
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,826
<i>lots of questions.</i>

539
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:26,322
<i>Am I good or evil?</i>

540
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,527
<i>Are we cowards or heroes?</i>

541
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:33,369
<i>Does God even know the difference?</i>

542
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:41,368
<i>Saint John of the Cross said there
are two sides to a man's soul.</i>

543
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,444
<i>These two are at war within all of us.</i>

544
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:48,013
<i>Has God abandoned me, Professor?</i>

545
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,517
<i>I know how confusing this must be,</i>

546
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,887
<i>but you need to know that you are not alone.</i>

547
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:58,156
<i>There are others. How is it
manifesting itself for you?</i>

548
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:01,895
<i>Manifesting itself? That's good.</i>

549
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,133
<i>I have so many questions for you.</i>

550
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,099
<i>Can I meet you somewhere, someplace safe?</i>

551
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:11,198
<i>There's someone following me, so...</i>

552
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,773
<i>No, I'll find you.</i>

553
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,345
<i>Don't worry.</i>

554
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,745

555
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:22,244
And what time does that one leave?

556
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:26,587
And it takes, like, what, couple hours?

557
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:31,154
Well, can I just buy it
there at the station?

558
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:34,489
Who are you talking to?

559
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:35,759
Nobody.

560
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:39,694
Great, I'm going down to the corner for
a pack of smokes.

561
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,872
You wanna come?

562
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:50,411
I'll be right back.

563
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,812
<i>It wasn't easy, Nathan, but consider it gone.</i>

564
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,514
I know I owe you big on this one, Tom.
I'm not gonna forget it.

565
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:00,386
<i>Yeah, I won't let you forget it.</i>

566
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,392
- Thanks.
<i>- Sure thing.</i>

567
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,553
Mom's rap sheet is now officially buried.

568
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:08,086
It only took half my political capital
to pull it off.

569
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:11,566
Why can't she get herself a hobby
like a normal person?

570
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:14,634
They were married 41 years.

571
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,570
It's a plea for attention.

572
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,040
She's lonely. Give her some time, will you?

573
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:20,337
I don't have time.

574
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,470
I got eight days to make up ten points.

575
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:26,175
I need all the help I can get, which
is what I wanna talk to you about.

576
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,945
I wanna offer you a job.

577
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:29,719
- A job?
- Yeah.

578
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,186
I trust you.

579
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,184
You're good with people.

580
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:36,317
I need a coordinator to help organize
the volunteers,

581
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:38,884
and you got nice guy instincts,
I could use that.

582
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:41,898
I'm a shark, Pete, everybody knows it.

583
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:44,391
And it's starting to
show up in the polls.

584
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:47,960
I bring you on, and it kind of reflects
well on me, you know what I mean?

585
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,632
Yeah, all right, so I make you look good.
That's a new one.

586
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,268
No, it makes me look like I put family first.

587
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,868
I mean, I know that sounds self-serving,

588
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:56,469
but this is for you, too, right?

589
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,071
You've got to think of your future.

590
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:00,241
- Why do you do that?
- Do what?

591
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:04,117
Even try to make it look like this has
something to do with me?

592
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,588
You didn't hear anything that I
said earlier today, did you?

593
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,818
That bit about how you can fly? Yeah. I did.

594
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:09,951
I'm gonna pretend for both our sakes

595
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,255
you didn't say anything like that.

596
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:13,819
I'm trying to do the right thing here.

597
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:15,058
Look, I already have a job.

598
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:17,794
Yeah, watching old people die,
now there's a career.

599
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,733
It's not cute anymore, man.

600
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:23,796
The dreamy kid, sitting in the back
of the classroom, staring out the window?

601
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,138
It's time for you to grow up.

602
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:31,173
Look, I cast a big shadow, Pete, I get it.

603
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:32,840
Life isn't fair.

604
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,878
But there's nothing I can do about that.

605
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:39,184
I'm trying to do the right thing
by you here, OK?

606
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:41,190
I don't want your pity.

607
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:18,884
Hey. Corner of Center and Canal, please.

608
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:26,263
Wow.

609
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,397
Solar eclipse.

610
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:33,375
Yeah, yeah, I wonder
if it's gonna be total.

611
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:35,109
Not here, no.

612
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:38,546
Some other part of the world, yes.
A global event.

613
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:42,108
Makes one appreciate just how small
our planet really is.

614
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:45,121
And we're all quite small really, aren't we?

615
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:49,056
What's your name?

616
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,150
Mohinder.

617
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,652
I'm Peter.

618
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:53,856
Let me ask you something, Mohinder.

619
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:56,695
Do you ever get the feeling
like you were meant

620
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:59,827
to do something... extraordinary?

621
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:03,135
I'm driving a cab, you may have noticed.

622
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:07,143
No, I'm not talking about what you
do, I'm talking about who you are.

623
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:10,738
I'm talking about being special.

624
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,805
Yes, we are all special.

625
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:15,986
That's not what I meant.

626
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:23,551
Some individuals, it is true,
are more special.

627
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:25,729
This is natural selection.

628
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:29,027
It begins as a single
individual, born or hatched,

629
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:32,091
like every other member
of their species, anonymous,

630
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,727
seemingly ordinary,

631
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:36,000
except they're not.

632
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:39,266
They carry inside them the genetic
code that will take their species

633
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,641
to the next evolutionary rung.

634
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,707
It's destiny.

635
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:52,946
Hey. Hey.

636
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,685
I can't believe you just left like that.

637
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:58,257
Yeah, I know, I was there.

638
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,024
You saved that dude's life, he was OK.

639
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:02,895

640
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:26,910
Welcome home.

641
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,362
Get over there. Fifty grand
is a lot of money.

642
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:41,419
Fifty?

643
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:43,356
It was 30. Even with interest...

644
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,663
Mr. Linderman wants to be nice about this.

645
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:48,500
You should have read the fine print.

646
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:53,304
Look, I have a son.

647
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:55,506
I'm all he's got.

648
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:56,568
Mmm.

649
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:01,146
Please, I can get you the money.

650
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:02,810
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

651
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:05,514
I'm gonna make you a little
business proposition.

652
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:09,821
You make, what, 40 bucks for every
20 minutes you take off your clothes?

653
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,896
Well, I'm gonna give you a chance to
lower your debt a little.

654
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:16,364
And see where it goes from there.

655
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:20,192
Come on.

656
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,274
Come on, show me what you got.

657
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,581

658
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:49,331
Lift up your shirt, baby.

659
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:54,061
Oh, look at that belly.

660
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:57,199
Smile for me.

661
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:00,237
Is that what you want?

662
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,777
Ah, yes.

663
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:08,946
What's the matter, baby? You just
started getting good here.

664
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,781
What's the problem, baby?

665
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:15,047
I said, what's the matter?

666
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:19,088
Screw you.

667
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:20,151
Screw me?

668
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:31,464

669
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:19,146
Nathan Petrelli. He served his
country in Bosnia.

670
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,423
Hey.

671
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:31,090
Oh, God. What? The silent treatment?

672
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:34,898
Oh, boy.

673
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,138
Isaac?

674
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,935
What the hell is wrong with you?

675
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:44,970
Isaac.

676
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:48,314
OK, stop.

677
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:50,553
What... What, are you crazy?

678
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:51,848
Clearly.

679
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:54,016
I don't even remember painting these.

680
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:57,450
- I was high, OK? I lied to you.
- Damn it.

681
00:49:58,095 --> 00:49:59,119
I've been chasing for a month.

682
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:02,256
Well, then, get yourself back into a program
and make it stick this time.

683
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,560
These are fantastic.

684
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:05,328
No! They're evil.

685
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:07,131
What are you talking about?

686
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:08,933
What am I talking about?

687
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,167
You know what I'm talking about?

688
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:13,371
You see this?

689
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:17,143
Suicide bombing in Israel.
I painted it three weeks ago.

690
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:18,306
Yeah, so?

691
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,275
So? That's this morning's paper.

692
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:24,420
Look at the number on the bus.

693
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:27,947
This happened yesterday.

694
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,118
Yesterday.

695
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:33,095
It was just a coincidence. You were high.

696
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:35,656
For all you know, you could have
painted it this morning.

697
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:36,721
No.

698
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:43,199
This is what I painted this morning.

699
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:52,439
Something's wrong with me.

700
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,382
OK, we'll get you some help. OK, Isaac?

701
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:57,181
I tried that, twice. There's only one way left.

702
00:50:57,587 --> 00:50:59,748
And you know it. You can't go
cold turkey, not alone.

703
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:01,051
I mean, let me help you, please.

704
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:02,182
No!

705
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,121
I'll drag you down with me,
I swear to God, I will.

706
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:07,686
Just leave me alone.

707
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:10,063
Get out of here!

708
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:14,092
Now!

709
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:05,248

710
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:03,778

711
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:25,523
<i>Manifesting yourself. That's good.</i>

712
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:30,705
<i>Ten percent of nothing is nothing.</i>

713
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:33,402
<i>Jerk should be grateful I even signed with him.</i>

714
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:36,001
<i>It's not like I don't love her.
I just got horny, that's all.</i>

715
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,707
<i>Love isn't a pie. There's enough to go around.</i>

716
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,175

717
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:47,721
<i>In the quietest of places, in
the smallest moments,</i>

718
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:50,225
<i>God is within me always.</i>

719
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:52,318

720
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,667
Captain.

721
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:06,373
Captain. Captain, I got to talk to you.

722
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:10,506
I can find out where they are.

723
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,411
- Where who are?
- The rest of the cell.

724
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:13,574
What are you talking about? How?

725
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,242
The same way I found him. I just...

726
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:17,343
I just have to ask him.

727
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,718
And I'll need a translator.
It's gonna be in Arabic.

728
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:21,518
- Arabic?
- Yeah.

729
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:24,287
If he knows, I'll find out. But...

730
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:28,696
there's a condition attached.

731
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:34,837

732
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:37,435
<i>Hi, this is Niki. Leave me a message.</i>

733
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,767
<i>Niki, if you're there, pick up. Niki, look,</i>

734
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,803
<i>please tell me that you have Micah,</i>

735
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,815
<i>because he's gone, along with
300 bucks from my purse.</i>

736
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:49,443
<i>Just call me, OK?</i>

737
00:54:57,694 --> 00:54:58,683

738
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,637

739
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:28,346

740
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,151
Thanks.

741
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:50,136
Where to, my friend?

742
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:51,339
JFK, please.

743
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:03,858
I'm going home to my family. These
business trips are wearing me out.

744
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:06,822
Suresh, huh?

745
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:09,026
I'm sorry?

746
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:12,595
Your name.On your llcense, there.

747
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:14,867
That's Indian, yes?

748
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:21,842
There was a Professor Suresh at the
University of Madras, a geneticist.

749
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:23,401
Interesting theories.

750
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:26,476
Don't think he's teaching anymore.

751
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:30,252
But you wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

752
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:33,215
Probably lots of Sureshes
where you're from.

753
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:36,826
Like Smith or Anderson.

754
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,417

755
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:06,479
And then Carla had the nerve to tell me
he's not breed-worthy.

756
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:09,819
Like he didn't win five all-breed rallies,
two regionals.

757
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:12,654
She says he doesn't look
sexy enough to breed.

758
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:14,287
Can you believe it?

759
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:16,929
It's just not true, Mr. Muggles.

760
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,333
It's not true. He's a little stud muffin,
that's what he is.

761
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:22,968
He still humps my leg when I watch TV.

762
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:25,769
All right, enough about Mr. Muggles.

763
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:27,975
What'd everybody else do today?

764
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:30,069
Doug and I saw this Mexican guy.

765
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:32,376
A homeless dude, on our way to school.

766
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,974
We thought he was dead, but he wasn't.

767
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:38,115
I thought Dad was coming home today.

768
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:40,383
Well, I was gonna surprise you.

769
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,688
He finished up early, he's coming
home tonight. Isn't that great?

770
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,625
Just in time to read
my report card.

771
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:48,789
So what about you, Claire,
do anything special today?

772
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,765
I walked through fire and I didn't get burned.

773
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:03,302
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

774
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:04,539
God, you're so crazy sometimes.

775
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:05,842
Lyle.

776
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:11,618
I think I know exactly what you mean.

777
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:14,849
Oh, here I am, talking dogs again.

778
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:17,893
And you go and say
something really profound.

779
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,964
We come up against all kinds
of fires in our lives,

780
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:25,194
and when we test ourselves
and face our fears,

781
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,803
we usually don't get burned.

782
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:31,267
You are very wise, sweetheart.

783
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:36,210
Whatever it is you did, I'm proud of you.
And so is Mr. Muggles.

784
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:38,042
He's just so proud of Claire.

785
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:39,741
Aren't we? We're proud of Claire.

786
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,317
Yes, we're so proud of Claire, aren't we?

787
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:43,909
She's the best.

788
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:50,085

789
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:54,192

790
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:16,908
Hiro.

791
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:55,513
Hiro!

792
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:56,647
Oi!

793
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:11,965
What are you looking for?

794
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:13,303
Morphine.

795
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:14,775
What for?

796
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,476
I need you to come
with me someplace.

797
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:17,604
Where?

798
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,874
You'll see.

799
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:21,478
Look, there's... There's something
I need to tell you.

800
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:22,950
Now that is gonna have to wait.

801
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:25,817
No. Look, I need to tell you
about this, OK?

802
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:27,685
I need to stop living for other people.

803
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:30,487
My whole life I've had no idea
what I'm supposed to do,

804
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,222
what I'm supposed to be, if I
even have a destiny of my own.

805
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,560
I promise you we will
talk about this later, OK?

806
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,157
But right now I really
need you to come with me.

807
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:42,193
You're a nurse, you can give
out a shot, you can help him.

808
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:43,260
Help who?

809
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:47,574
I thought we could go to the movies
this Saturday,

810
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:52,411
maybe try on some shoes
at the new mall in Gardendale.

811
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:55,706
Sure.

812
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,781
I love you, Mom.

813
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,179
But?

814
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:07,362
No buts. I just...

815
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:09,721
I just wanted to tell you that.

816
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:13,402
Now you think I'm trying to be
your best friend again, admit it.

817
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:14,458
No.

818
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:18,938
It's all right, we can go to the
movies together. It's no big deal.

819
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,943
I just miss you, that's all.

820
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,546
I wanna be your mom, I wanna
give you advice.

821
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:31,086
But I don't wanna push you away.

822
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:32,985
I want advice, I do.

823
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:37,018
I won't push you away, I promise.

824
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:40,527

825
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:46,665
I just don't think you should be so
worried about fitting in all the time.

826
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:49,664
About being so popular.

827
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:52,469
I don't want to see you
make mistakes like I did.

828
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:56,000
I wanted to be someone more
interesting than I am.

829
01:01:56,746 --> 01:02:00,273
You are interesting. You breed
show dogs. Whose mom does that?

830
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:04,119
No, I wanted to hitchhike across Europe.

831
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:09,186
Study art. Fall in love with
some... poetry-quoting Frenchman.

832
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:12,889
Not that your dad isn't
wonderful, but my point is,

833
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:16,295
you should know who you are
and know that it's enough.

834
01:02:16,365 --> 01:02:18,595
'cause who you are is special.

835
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,197
About that.

836
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:27,367
There's something I need to say.

837
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:32,405
Something I never talked about 'cause
I thought it would upset you and Dad.

838
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:36,246
Sweetheart, you can say
anything to us, you know that.

839
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:42,316
I think I'm old enough for you
to tell me who my real parents are.

840
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:47,194
Of course you are.

841
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,925
Honey, I'm home.

842
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:55,564
Your father.

843
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:00,665
Hey, honey.

844
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:05,376
Bad, Mr. Muggles. No.

845
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:07,037

846
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:10,382
- I'm glad you're home.
- Oh, me, too.

847
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:13,650
I have such a headache. I slammed my head
getting out of a taxicab.

848
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:14,815
Hi, Daddy.

849
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,322
Hey, baby.

850
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:30,468
I'll ask you one more time.

851
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,871
And only one more time.

852
01:03:36,879 --> 01:03:38,039
Are you in?

853
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:43,608
You found me seconds before I died.

854
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:46,215
How is that possible?

855
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:47,313
Fate.

856
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:50,781
Fate...

857
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:58,160
Maybe I was not meant to die.

858
01:03:58,234 --> 01:03:59,701
And maybe she was.

859
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:05,170
Allah is merciful.

860
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:09,804
He always has a plan.
He has a plan for you, Amid.

861
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:14,841
You'll help us.

862
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:20,018
It's your purpose.

863
01:04:26,662 --> 01:04:28,391
Bring me a glass of water.

864
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:30,120

865
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:34,126
The device you stole...

866
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:36,828
you'll need more plutonium.

867
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:38,032
How do you know that?

868
01:04:38,107 --> 01:04:39,699
And not just plutonium.

869
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:42,972
You'll need enough P-235,
enough beryllium mixture,

870
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:46,310
and you will need a lot more
to take out your target.

871
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,646
- A lot more.
- Where do we get it from?

872
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:50,316
Untie my hands.

873
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:58,222
Six months ago, I woke to something extraordinary.

874
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:00,588
An ability.

875
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:03,654
A curse.

876
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:09,028
Where it came from? I don't know.

877
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,266
But now,

878
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,067
I think it might be my purpose.

879
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:22,443
I can emit 45,000 curies of radiation
from the palm of my hand.

880
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:30,089
Enough to give cancer to those I love.

881
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:37,155
Enough to detonate a five megaton
thermonuclear device.

882
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:13,329

883
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:19,736
Turn around! Get against the wall!
Get against the wall!

884
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,573
Get against the wall, now!
Now, damn it! Move it!

885
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:28,047
Hey, get your hands where I can see them.

886
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:32,311
Amid!

887
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:33,514
Matt?

888
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:35,887

889
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:49,193

890
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:52,634
Hello, New York!

891
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:04,905
You sure your ride's coming?

892
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:06,447
Yeah, I'm sure.

893
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:07,880
You be careful, son.

894
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,417

895
01:08:57,867 --> 01:08:58,856
Sylar!

896
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:03,502
I'm just saying it's impossible, OK?
Nobody can predict the future.

897
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:04,596
I saw it with my own eyes, Peter.

898
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:06,971
Isaac? I brought someone here to help.

899
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:08,373
He's a nurse.

900
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:11,301
Isaac.

901
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:14,872
Isaac?

902
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:20,210
Isaac?

903
01:09:22,591 --> 01:09:24,786
Maybe he went out. I don't know.

904
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:26,583
Isaac.

905
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:29,459
Simone!

906
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:31,397
Oh, God.

907
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,489
OK.

908
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:34,794
Oh, my God. Isaac?

909
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:37,395
He's alive. Call 911.

910
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:40,237
- I need a tourniquet.
- What have you done?

911
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:54,114
Yeah, I'm at 215 Reed Street, number 7.

912
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:58,092
I need an ambulance here immediately.
Someone has cut off his hand.

913
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:02,928
No, no, he's conscious. Just barely.

914
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:06,498
I know. Listen, could you just come?

915
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:11,697
Did you find something? I think
there's some towels in the sink.

916
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:26,544
OK, baby, it's OK, they're sending
an ambulance right now, OK?

917
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:28,749
You just hang in there, OK?

918
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:37,092
We have to stop it.

919
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:43,702
- Oh, baby...
- We have to stop it.

920
01:10:55,651 --> 01:11:00,588
<i>This quest, this need to solve
life's mysteries.</i>

921
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:04,016
<i>In the end, what does it matter</i>

922
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:06,061
<i>when the human heart
can only find meaning</i>

923
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:08,596
<i>in the smallest of moments?</i>

924
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:13,568
<i>They're here. Among us.</i>

925
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:19,567
<i>In the shadows, in the light. Everywhere.</i>

926
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:24,376
<i>Do they even know yet?</i>

927
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:41,760
All right, I'm here. Now what do you want?

928
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:45,322
Peter?

929
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:55,537
I've been up here all night
thinking about this.

930
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:58,371
Thinking about my destiny.

931
01:11:59,381 --> 01:12:00,905
What are you doing, Pete?

932
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:03,679
It's my turn to be somebody now, Nathan!

933
01:12:04,253 --> 01:12:06,551
Come on, Peter, quit screwing around!

934
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:57,229
Peter!

935
01:12:57,306 --> 01:12:58,466

936
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:00,368
Peter, hang on.

937
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:05,309
How did you... You're flying.
You're flying!

938
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:06,712
I don't know.

939
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,877
I don't know. Oh, God.

940
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:10,984
- Peter.
- Nathan!
