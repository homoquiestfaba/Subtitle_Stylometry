Alfred Zimmer.

5
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:47,002
Friends call me Alfie,
Alfie Zimmer.

00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:52,001
Room 19.

7
00:01:54,002 --> 00:01:55,002
Allright.

8
00:01:56,503 --> 00:01:59,004
- Mind if I tell you something?
- Not at all.

9
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:02,005
I've been selling in the
Midwest for twenty years,

10
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:05,509
and I have formulated four basic rules
for securing my night's rest.

11
00:02:06,506 --> 00:02:08,006
One, always reserve ahead.

12
00:02:09,007 --> 00:02:13,710
Two, always reserve at a franchise motel
if it all possible - your Holiday Inn,

13
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:16,013
your Ramada Inn, your
Confort Inn, your Motel 6.

14
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:18,509
Three, always get a room on the end.

15
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,512
That way, you only have is
one set of noisy neighbors of at all.

16
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:25,011
Four, always get a room that starts with a one.
Do you know why?

17
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:27,512
Why is that?

18
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:32,214
Because, I'm forty-four years old, too
old to be fucking truck-stop whores,

19
00:02:32,215 --> 00:02:35,517
eating chicken-fried steak,
or hauling my luggage upstairs.

20
00:02:36,512 --> 00:02:37,512
Okee Dokie.

21
00:02:42,515 --> 00:02:46,118
Of course, the problem with
rooms that begin with a one...

22
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:48,520
...is that they're all
non-smoking these days.

23
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:49,528
So, I have a rule for that, too.

24
00:02:50,517 --> 00:02:52,518
Ask for'em and smoke anyway.

& FROZEN FOOD &

27
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,524
There is a market for gourmet foods
in Nebraska, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas;

28
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,122
even in the Dakotas, although
you might not believe it.

29
00:03:23,521 --> 00:03:26,796
I've done quite well, especially
over the last two years...

30
00:03:26,797 --> 00:03:30,071
as I've gotten to know the
market's deeper creases- but...

31
00:03:30,072 --> 00:03:35,077
it's never going to equal the market for,
let's say, fertilizer.

32
00:03:40,523 --> 00:03:42,024
Is it possible that behind those lights,

33
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:46,528
some farmer's wife is even now heating
up a pot of Cottager Split Pea Soup.

34
00:03:46,724 --> 00:03:51,896
Or perhaps micro-waving a Cottager
Shepherd's Pie or Chicken Francais?

35
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:55,232
It is. It's as possible as Hell.

36
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:59,628
Her husband watches the early
news with his shoes off...

37
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:02,030
...and his socked feet on a hassock,

38
00:04:02,526 --> 00:04:06,684
...and overhead their son plays
a video game on his Game Cube...

39
00:04:09,685 --> 00:04:11,311
...and their daughter lies on a bed,

40
00:04:11,312 --> 00:04:15,000
kicking her feet behind
her, reading Harry Potter.

41
00:04:31,028 --> 00:04:32,028
Can I help you?

42
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:34,281
I just dropped by for a dinner.

43
00:04:35,532 --> 00:04:38,034
That sounds a good
great idea. Come on in.

44

46
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:13,657
Can I help you?

47
00:05:14,908 --> 00:05:18,286
Ma'am, according to at least
one source I've read recently,

48
00:05:18,287 --> 00:05:20,538
'All that you love
will be carried away.'

49
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:29,200
Maybe then I could offer her...

50
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:32,536
...a sample box of Cottager
brand quick-serve gourmet foods.

51
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,535
Maybe she'd have
a particular taste for caviar.

52
00:05:37,034 --> 00:05:39,035
Many did.
Even in Ohio.

53
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:03,536

Frozen gourmet foods.

54
00:06:06,536 --> 00:06:09,203
Charles More... Fertilizer.

55
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:11,539
- Yeah, I can tell you, remembered
the truck.  - Right.

56
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,942
How about that botany
make up around Mansfield?

57
00:06:13,943 --> 00:06:15,144
You get called in there?

58
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:19,548
Yeah. Truck dropped that tassel.
I missed my last meeting.

59
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:22,037
You know why?

60
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:26,540
I already know
what it looks like inside this room.

61
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:30,539
It's square.

62
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,666
The walls are white.

63
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:36,044
On one wall is a picture of daylilies,
orchids or something.

64
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,051
It's cold in there right now,

65
00:06:38,052 --> 00:06:41,072
but if I hit that "High Heat"
button on the Climatron,

66
00:06:41,073 --> 00:06:44,094
it'd heat up real fast,
probably become too hot.

67
00:06:45,044 --> 00:06:48,847
There are twin-beds, identical
gold bed spreads on each one,

68
00:06:48,848 --> 00:06:52,270
first tucked under the pillows
and then pulled back over them,

69
00:06:52,271 --> 00:06:54,552
so that they resemble
corpses of infants.

70
00:06:56,046 --> 00:06:58,548
On the table beside the bed
there is a flesh colored phone,

71
00:06:58,549 --> 00:07:00,049
a Gideon Bible.

72
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:04,549
In the bathroom,
if you turn on the light,

73
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,050
you get the fan, too.

74
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:07,648
There is no way around there.

75
00:07:08,049 --> 00:07:09,049
And then, the smell.

76
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,302
Can come a harsh chemical
cleansers' smell...

77
00:07:13,303 --> 00:07:16,055
...next with the mildew
on the shower curtain.

78
00:07:20,051 --> 00:07:21,551
It's the room of my dreams.

79
00:08:32,552 --> 00:08:33,942
I bought this notebook
seven years ago...

80
00:08:33,943 --> 00:08:38,224
...in the stationary department of some
five-and-dime in Omaha or Sioux City...

81
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:42,561
- ...for a dollar and nine cents.

83
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:48,377
Restrooms are filled
with homosexual graffiti,

84
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:51,279
most of it tiresome
and repetitive,

85
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,282
but "poutie boy mouth"
is pretty good.

86
00:09:13,057 --> 00:09:15,558
Poopie doopie you so loopy.
(Papillion, NEB)

87
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:17,308
I'm crazy about that one.

88
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:23,563
Something about the "-ie, -ie,"
and then, boom, you got "-y".

89
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,396
It could be no more than
an illiterate's mistake,

90
00:09:27,397 --> 00:09:29,064
but why think like that?

91
00:09:29,561 --> 00:09:30,561
What fun would that be?

92
00:09:30,562 --> 00:09:33,364
No, I prefer to believe
that "-ie, -ie"...

93
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:37,568
...wait for it... "-y" was
an intended construction.

94
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:39,864
Something sneaky
but playful,

95
00:09:39,865 --> 00:09:42,567
with the feel of an
"E.E. Cummings" poem.

96
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:47,068
Two today.

97
00:09:47,564 --> 00:09:49,064
I found two today.

98
00:09:50,065 --> 00:09:51,565
Two in one day.

99
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:54,066
Two on the last day.

100
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:58,567

on the radio...

memories of a place, or a time...

114
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,381
I started collecting
bits of graffiti...

115
00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:51,083
...without at first
knowing why I was doing it.

116
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:54,083
They were just amusing,
or disconcerting,

117
00:12:55,584 --> 00:12:56,585
or both at the same time.

118
00:12:57,082 --> 00:13:01,586
Yet, little by little I became fascinated
with these messages from the innerstate,

119
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:04,301
where the only other communications
seem to be dipped headlights...

120
00:13:04,302 --> 00:13:05,636
...when you passed in the rain,

121
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:08,686
or maybe somebody in a bad
mood flipping you the bird...

122
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:12,590
...when you went by in the passing lane
pulling a roaster-tail of snow behind you.

123
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:15,087
I came gradually to see...

124
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,090
- or perhaps only hope -

125
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:21,092
that something was
going on here.

126
00:13:22,086 --> 00:13:26,090
The E. E. Cummings' lilt of
"Poopie doopie you so loopy",

127
00:13:26,091 --> 00:13:31,094
for instance, or the
inarticulate rage...

128
00:13:32,587 --> 00:13:35,389

Here I sit, cheeks a flexin',
giving birth to another Texan.

132
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,092
The meter,
when you consider it, is odd.

133
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:54,894
Is not iambs, but some
odd triplet formula...

134
00:13:54,895 --> 00:13:56,596
...with the stress on the third.

135
00:13:57,592 --> 00:14:04,598
Here I sit, cheeks a flexin',
giving birth to another Texan.

136
00:14:05,093 --> 00:14:07,595
Of course, it broke down
a little towards the end.

137
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:10,596
I thought on many occasions
I could go back to school,

138
00:14:10,597 --> 00:14:14,099
take some courses, get all that
feet-and-meter stuff down pat.

139
00:14:14,595 --> 00:14:15,496
Know that
I was talking about...

140
00:14:15,497 --> 00:14:18,098
...instead of running on
a tightrope of intuition.

141
00:14:18,596 --> 00:14:22,599
All I really remember clearly
from the school is iambic pentameter.

142
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:26,500
"To be or not to be,
that is the question."

143

& The real question is
who your father was, dipstick. &

144
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,002
I had thought about
writing a book once.

145
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,003
Just a little one.

146
00:14:32,601 --> 00:14:35,066
The first title that
occurred to me was...

147
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:38,025
"Don't Look Up Here, You're
Pissing On Your Shoes"...

148
00:14:38,026 --> 00:14:39,998
...but you couldn't call a book that.

149
00:14:40,602 --> 00:14:42,603
Not and reasonably hope someone...

150
00:14:42,604 --> 00:14:44,605
...could put it out for
sale in a store anyway.

151
00:14:45,103 --> 00:14:47,104
And, besides, that was light.
Frothy.

152
00:14:47,605 --> 00:14:51,999
I became convinced over the years
that something was going on here.

153
00:14:53,606 --> 00:14:56,709
The title I finally decided
on was an adaptation of...

154
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:00,646
...something I'd seen in a
rest-area stall outside Fort Scott,

155
00:15:00,647 --> 00:15:02,614
Kansas, on Highway 54.

156
00:15:03,107 --> 00:15:08,110
I Killed Ted Bundy: The Secret
Transit Code of America's Highways,

157
00:15:08,111 --> 00:15:09,612
by Alfred Zimmer.

158
00:15:10,608 --> 00:15:13,944
That sounded mysterious
and ominous,

159
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:15,612
almost scholarly.

160
00:15:17,109 --> 00:15:18,109
But I hadn't done it.

161
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,911
I'm just a little man,
after all,

162
00:15:21,912 --> 00:15:23,112
with a little man's job.

163
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:25,611

165
00:15:29,613 --> 00:15:31,117
And now, of course...

166
00:15:33,618 --> 00:15:34,618
...now.

167
00:15:57,614 --> 00:15:58,614
Hi, it's me.

168
00:15:59,115 --> 00:16:00,115
I'm in Wentworth.

169
00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:02,816
Remember the casserole...

170
00:16:02,817 --> 00:16:04,618
...you were gonna
take over to my mother.

171
00:16:04,622 --> 00:16:07,000
She is expecting it, so...

172
00:16:09,618 --> 00:16:11,996
Oh, she asked for
the Red Ball coupons.

173
00:16:12,619 --> 00:16:14,747
I know you think she's
crazy on that subject,

174
00:16:14,748 --> 00:16:16,999
but go ahead and humor her,
okay? She's old.

175
00:16:20,621 --> 00:16:22,622
Tell Carlene that
Daddy says, "Hi".

176
00:16:28,872 --> 00:16:29,872
I love you.

177
00:17:16,124 --> 00:17:17,124
It's me again.

178
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:21,628
Don't forget Rambo's appointment
at the vet day after tomorrow, okay?

179
00:17:22,126 --> 00:17:25,128
And the sea-jerky strips at night.

180
00:17:25,137 --> 00:17:26,640
They really do help his hips.

181
00:17:30,641 --> 00:17:31,641
Bye.

182
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,043
Okee Dokie.

183
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:44,281
The first thing anyone  would
see, responding to the shot,

184
00:17:44,282 --> 00:17:46,051
would be my dead body of course,

185
00:17:46,052 --> 00:17:49,000
my head hanging down and
bleeding on the nubbly rug.

186
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,998
The second thing, however,
would be the Spiral notebook.

187
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:03,099
Watch the blood.

188
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:12,733
"All that you love...
will be carried away."

189
00:18:13,632 --> 00:18:16,634
Frank, looks like this nutjob
left a suicide note.

190
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,768
"Elvis killed big pussy."

191
00:18:24,134 --> 00:18:24,976
I think we're lucky...

192
00:18:24,977 --> 00:18:27,502
...this guy didn't decide to
visit a schoolyard with an AK-47.

193
00:18:27,635 --> 00:18:29,636
Take a bunch of little kids.

194
00:18:33,136 --> 00:18:34,228
But, I'm not crazy,

195
00:18:35,229 --> 00:18:38,437
and the things I've written here
over the years aren't crazy, either.

196
00:18:38,438 --> 00:18:39,507
I'm convinced of it.

197
00:18:40,638 --> 00:18:41,760
They'll think I'm crazy...

198
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:44,006
...if they find this
notebook, though. They will.

199
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,007
And is that fair to
Maura or Carlene?

200
00:18:47,141 --> 00:18:50,143
Carlene who's at her
j.v. basketball game right now?

201
00:18:52,142 --> 00:18:53,142
No, of course not.

202
00:18:58,643 --> 00:19:01,010
But, there's nothing fair about
what happened to me, either.

203
00:19:01,644 --> 00:19:03,813
Sometimes when you're
cruising along the highway,

204
00:19:03,814 --> 00:19:06,733
you see big curls of rubber
that have unwound from...

205
00:19:06,734 --> 00:19:09,653
...the recap tires some of
the independent truckers use.

206
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:13,647
That's what I feel like.

207
00:19:15,148 --> 00:19:16,148
Thrown tread.

208
00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:21,649
The pills make it worse.

209
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:26,653
They clear your mind just enough
to see what a colossal jam you're in.

210
00:19:28,653 --> 00:19:31,875
It's an embarrassment to me
if they find the notebook,

211
00:19:31,876 --> 00:19:34,023
and I can't explain
the reasons behind it.

212
00:19:34,154 --> 00:19:37,156
If I can't explain that
there is something profound...

213
00:19:37,157 --> 00:19:39,158
...within the context
of these messages.

214
00:19:39,255 --> 00:19:42,007
It would be like accidentally
hanging yourself in the closet...

215
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:45,135
because you were experimenting
with a new way of jerking off and...

216
00:19:45,136 --> 00:19:48,263
...got found that way with your shorts
under your feet and shit on your ankles.

217
00:19:49,658 --> 00:19:51,659
Behind the picture, maybe?

218
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:54,159
That might work.

219
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,527
But they'll still find the pills
in my coat pocket.

220
00:20:01,661 --> 00:20:02,995
They're prescription, sure,

221
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:05,664
but not the sort the doctor
gives you if you're feeling sunny.

222
00:20:07,662 --> 00:20:09,663
And if they find the pills,
they'll look harder.

223
00:20:09,663 --> 00:20:12,665
Then, the things inside my
notebook will look worse,

224
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,668
even crazier, because of the
pains I'd taken to hide it.

225
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:33,031
I'll throw it in
Farmer John's field.

226
00:20:34,665 --> 00:20:37,467
Soon, he'll come out
this way on his tractor,

227
00:20:37,468 --> 00:20:41,671
the cab filled with music of
Patty Loveless or Larry Underwood,

228
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:46,436
or maybe even Clint Black and he will plow
the notebook under without seeing it...

229
00:20:46,437 --> 00:20:48,772
...and it will disappear
into the scheme of things.

230
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:57,034
Someone in Cameron, Missouri
had once written:

231
00:20:57,168 --> 00:21:00,170
"Relax, it's all just the rinse cycle."

232
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:11,037
See, a shot in the mouth
would be easier than any living change.

233
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:16,506
Far easier than struggling
to write a book few people,

234
00:21:16,507 --> 00:21:18,174
if any at all,
are likely to read.

235
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:28,172
I'll count down from sixty.

236
00:21:29,672 --> 00:21:34,926
If the light in the kitchen comes
on by the time I reach one...

237
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,678
I'll write the book.

238
00:21:42,173 --> 00:21:45,626
In order to write a book like that,
you'd have to begin by talking about...

239
00:21:45,627 --> 00:21:49,179
...how it was to measure
distance in green mile markers,

240
00:21:50,174 --> 00:21:52,175
and the very width of land,

241
00:21:53,675 --> 00:21:56,860
and how the wind sounded when
you got out of your car...

242
00:21:56,861 --> 00:22:00,046
...at one of those rest areas
in Oklahoma or North Dakota.

243
00:22:00,176 --> 00:22:02,177
How it sounded almost like words.

244
00:22:03,677 --> 00:22:05,746
You'd have to explicate
that silence,

245
00:22:06,247 --> 00:22:09,351
and how the badrooms
always smelled of piss...

246
00:22:09,352 --> 00:22:12,286
and the great hollow farts
of departed travelers,

247
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:16,689
and how in that silence the
voices on the walls began to speak.

248
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:22,047
The voices of those who had written
and then moved on.

249
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,434
That telling...

250
00:22:25,935 --> 00:22:27,435
...that would hurt,

251
00:22:29,935 --> 00:22:37,255
but if the wind drops and the
spark lights of the farm come back,

252
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:39,696
I'll do that anyway.

253
00:22:40,181 --> 00:22:41,181
If they don't,... well.

254
00:22:43,682 --> 00:22:44,688
Either way.

255
00:22:49,689 --> 00:22:50,689
Either way.

256
00:22:53,183 --> 00:22:54,183
Sixty.

257
00:22:56,684 --> 00:22:57,684
