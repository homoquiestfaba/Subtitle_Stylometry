00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:07,914
It's insane to use

Do you want to warranty?

279
00:41:21,435 --> 00:41:25,018

Study Katukurundan airport without attracting attention.

291
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:24,665

machine.

292
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:27,788

293

298
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:51,649
He said that

299
00:42:51,821 --> 00:42:54,857

300

Tutkinko address?
- She does not live there.

301

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,461

307
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:32,982
If you were not interested,
you had said it immediately.

308
00:43:33,197 --> 00:43:37,776
You're making me share the blame.
- Come on, Miss Dilky.

309
00:43:37,994 --> 00:43:43,534
You are not so important. If Sri Lanka lost to India in cricket
-

310
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:50,417
it does not implicate the TV channels.
You look to the people what has to be.

311
00:43:50,632 --> 00:43:53,668
This is not cricket, damn it!

312
00:43:53,843 --> 00:43:56,595
Son of a bitch. You're right, Dilky.

313
00:43:56,763 --> 00:44:01,010
And there is no shortage of suppliers.

314
00:44:01,226 --> 00:44:05,972
They're rushing about around the stupid stories behind.

315
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,977
This is the right news.

316
00:44:11,612 --> 00:44:14,483
Am I right, Dilky?

317
00:44:16,409 --> 00:44:18,982

318
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:26,626

Or, he was removed from the task...
Outrageous.

323
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:34,233
He is  Dilfer, sir.

324
00:45:34,448 --> 00:45:36,275
Yeah?
- Welcome.

325
00:45:36,492 --> 00:45:42,328

00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:46,538
Is he qualified?
- Must be overqualified.

327
00:45:46,752 --> 00:45:49,956
He has helped to resolve the
serious crimes.

328
00:45:50,173 --> 00:45:53,209
Difficult for you, not for me.

329
00:45:53,426 --> 00:45:57,091
Do not worry.
I can help you, buddy. Sir.

330
00:45:57,305 --> 00:46:01,634
That's why you're here, boy.
You will help us to find the madman.

331
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:05,013
Right. Let's do it.

332
00:46:17,659 --> 00:46:23,912
Why paapomme terrorists?
I teloittaisin them all.

333
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:27,209
Calm down. We are police officers.

334
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,456
You are not a Terminator.

Call me when you get there.

340

What's going on?

341
00:48:54,155 --> 00:48:56,647
Where are you taking us?
- Shut up.

342
00:48:56,825 --> 00:49:00,574

Let him go.

405
00:56:07,481 --> 00:56:10,932
What if we are not told

Bombs, and these men the range of

00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:07,741
Are the four prisoners on the plane?

415
00:57:26,813 --> 00:57:30,063
Where is it?

416
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:37,735
Phone is here!
- Give it to me.

417
00:58:28,085 --> 00:58:30,837

Warriors are on the way.

00:58:40,681 --> 00:58:42,555
Sir!

420
00:58:42,767 --> 00:58:45,009

Three prisoners were killed.

425
00:59:01,953 --> 00:59:04,908
What do you mean three?

426
00:59:05,123 --> 00:59:08,658
Master, Gopinath and Kumar have died
.

427
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:14,340
Akthul Majood live.
We bring her there.

428
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:41,901
What the hell did you do?

429
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:48,166
No. No.

430
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:51,832
What the hell did you do?

431
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:57,883
You made a big mistake.
You will replace it.

432
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:05,762
Enter Akthulin to hear this.

433
01:00:08,731 --> 01:00:13,393
Intention was to release all the four prisoners of this world.

434
01:00:13,611 --> 01:00:19,697
The work was never completed. Officers,
you will take care of it in the end.

435
01:00:24,956 --> 01:00:28,160
What do you mean?

436
01:00:28,377 --> 01:00:32,291
If the kitchen is cockroach -

437
01:00:32,506 --> 01:00:37,168
hellitkö it or liiskaatko it?
Just what this is all about.

438
01:00:37,386 --> 01:00:43,970
'll Clean the cockroaches in the corners.
- Enough! Where's the rest of the bombs?

439
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:54,233
Who are you?
Do you have a name?

440
01:00:54,445 --> 01:00:56,901
Why is it interesting?

441
01:00:57,115 --> 01:01:02,536
You know me very well.
I am afraid to get on a train or a bus.

442
01:01:02,746 --> 01:01:07,740
My wife thinks that I go to
for the war, when I go to work.

443
01:01:07,918 --> 01:01:12,995
He plays every couple of hours, it
afraid that I will not return.

444
01:01:13,215 --> 01:01:18,969
call to hear if I'm alive. If I want to open a shop -

445
01:01:19,179 --> 01:01:24,470
I do not dare to name it, because it can be burned
brawler.

446
01:01:24,685 --> 01:01:31,055
Fought  anyone,
I'm always the first victim.

447
01:01:31,275 --> 01:01:37,480
Choose someone in the crowd.
I am he.

448
01:01:37,699 --> 01:01:43,452
Sri Lankan citizen.
Fallen in love with the country.

449
01:01:43,663 --> 01:01:47,708
Why do you have a nice special occasion?
We all love our country.

450
01:01:49,085 --> 01:01:52,419
What kind of man are you?

451
01:01:52,631 --> 01:01:56,925
Who do you think you are? Superman?

452
01:01:57,135 --> 01:02:02,972
I'm not Superman.
Rather, the Invisible Man.

453
01:02:03,183 --> 01:02:07,680
I have even removed
voting register.

454
01:02:07,855 --> 01:02:10,690
I do not exist.

455
01:02:10,816 --> 01:02:16,689
So, Mr. AP... In order to purchase
-

456
01:02:16,864 --> 01:02:23,579
heksogeenipommiin materials need not be Teräsmies.

457
01:02:23,788 --> 01:02:27,786
It manages the invisible man.
Take a look at the internet.

458
01:02:28,001 --> 01:02:32,746
Hundreds of pages will guide in making bombs.

459
01:02:32,964 --> 01:02:36,914
Do not ask me how, ask us why!

460
01:02:37,135 --> 01:02:42,510
Why? Focus on the present moment,
Mr. AP.

461
01:02:44,184 --> 01:02:50,021
One of the cockroach still have to whack.
Then tell you where the bombs are.

462
01:02:50,232 --> 01:02:57,065
If we do not kill Majoodia,
you are going to blow up the bombs.

463
01:02:57,281 --> 01:02:59,819
You're killing innocent people.

464
01:03:00,034 --> 01:03:05,823
Right. If he is released, he will kill thousands of
.

465
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:10,418
I ask only one person.
He ​​would have to death.

466
01:03:10,628 --> 01:03:14,757
Compare the alternatives.
This is a good bargain.

467
01:03:14,925 --> 01:03:19,338
Why are these four
so many terrorists?

468
01:03:19,554 --> 01:03:23,220
These four held a lottery happiness.

469
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:32,139
Do not you dare to tell your name?
- Do not worry about it.

470
01:03:32,359 --> 01:03:37,734
You should have to destroy these creatures
after the attacks.

471
01:03:37,907 --> 01:03:40,908
Sessions were several
but did not do anything.

472
01:03:41,118 --> 01:03:46,789
Causes of terrorism does not matter.
The same place where they are from.

473
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:53,501
Causes need to be addressed, but not
at the expense of innocent lives.

474
01:03:54,382 --> 01:03:57,419
They hit the train station.

475
01:03:57,636 --> 01:04:02,013
We cried a couple of days.
Then they hit the holy city.

476
01:04:02,224 --> 01:04:05,723
Then to the airport.
How many were killed? Have you already forgotten?

477
01:04:05,894 --> 01:04:09,678
Forgetting is a national sicknesses.

478
01:04:09,857 --> 01:04:14,400
Terrorism must be destroyed.

479
01:04:14,612 --> 01:04:19,819
A quick right.
- Why not? Terrorism is urgent.

480
01:04:20,034 --> 01:04:24,495
If we wait, it just evolves.
New names, new shapes.

481
01:04:24,705 --> 01:04:27,742
The core remains the same. Terrorism.

482
01:04:27,917 --> 01:04:33,872
You want to destroy terrorism but to terrorize us!

483
01:04:35,508 --> 01:04:38,296
What religion you belong to?

484
01:04:38,511 --> 01:04:42,723
Religion? There is...

485
01:04:42,891 --> 01:04:46,759
This is not about religion.

486
01:04:46,937 --> 01:04:52,940
Gopinath was a Hindu. Murderer.
I killed him. So am I a Muslim?

487
01:04:53,152 --> 01:04:57,150
Sarath Master, a Buddhist.
Thousands killer. I killed him.

488
01:04:57,364 --> 01:04:59,690
Does that make me a Christian?

489
01:04:59,867 --> 01:05:05,241
You may argue religions attributed
unsuspecting people.

490
01:05:05,456 --> 01:05:07,947
It is up to you.

491
01:05:08,167 --> 01:05:13,328
You can push out the lies on TV
and brainwash the gullible.

492
01:05:13,548 --> 01:05:16,668
Do not join together by me to any group.

493
01:05:16,843 --> 01:05:21,920
I am an ordinary citizen,
which went into action.

494
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:27,383
Maybe I'm just a Christian or a Buddhist.
Communist or an atheist.

495
01:05:27,604 --> 01:05:30,771
Do not we have the right to get angry?

496
01:05:30,983 --> 01:05:34,186
Right to say that enough is enough.

497
01:05:34,403 --> 01:05:37,902
This is not about race, religion or politics,
.

498
01:05:38,115 --> 01:05:41,484
You'll need to know
that the people will be angry.

499
01:05:41,702 --> 01:05:44,620
Do not tempt the patience.

500
01:05:45,831 --> 01:05:50,410
I do not know what you're trying to prove,
but you will not succeed.

501
01:05:50,628 --> 01:05:53,748
I'll find you.

502
01:05:53,965 --> 01:06:00,134
I have already succeeded, Mr. AP.
I got your attention.

503
01:06:00,346 --> 01:06:02,920
Tell me something.

504
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:09,474
Someone close to you he dead in bomb attacks?

505
01:06:09,689 --> 01:06:14,186
Why should I wait
that anyone close die?

506
01:06:19,366 --> 01:06:22,451
I'll tell you one thing.

507
01:06:22,661 --> 01:06:25,532
There was someone on the train.

508
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:30,790
Approximately twenty-something man.
I do not know his name.

509
01:06:31,003 --> 01:06:34,669
He always greeted me with a,
when the boarded the train.

510
01:06:34,841 --> 01:06:37,758
I salute him.

511
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:41,462
We did not know each other's names.

512
01:06:41,681 --> 01:06:45,050
We said only "hello" to each other.

513
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:50,638
He showed me the engagement rings
previous day.

514
01:06:50,816 --> 01:06:53,817
He was happy.

515
01:06:54,027 --> 01:06:58,191
The next day
missed the train, and I cheated death.

516
01:06:58,407 --> 01:07:01,443
He did not.

517
01:07:04,997 --> 01:07:09,209
After the train was no longer the familiar words.

518
01:07:09,418 --> 01:07:12,585
Wagons full of the unknown.

519
01:07:20,805 --> 01:07:25,348
What does it matter who I am?

520
01:07:27,729 --> 01:07:32,771
When you leave home,
may not be able to return.

521
01:07:32,943 --> 01:07:37,771
When the children go to school,
not be able to see them ever again.

522
01:07:38,615 --> 01:07:43,361
Akthul, Gopinath and Sarath
may be a crossroads -

523
01:07:43,579 --> 01:07:48,490
bomb.
He ​​will blow your dreams.

524
01:07:50,085 --> 01:07:52,956
They kill anyone.

525
01:07:54,465 --> 01:07:59,044
Terrorism must be crushed as soon as it starts.

526
01:07:59,262 --> 01:08:02,797
You behave like a crazy terrorist.

527
01:08:03,016 --> 01:08:05,767
Let me explain.

528
01:08:05,977 --> 01:08:11,351
If they killed 300 - 400 people -

529
01:08:11,566 --> 01:08:14,900
you expect the court.

530
01:08:15,111 --> 01:08:21,031
I'll kill four terrorists,
and you are panicking.

531
01:08:21,243 --> 01:08:23,734
I do not blame you.

532
01:08:23,912 --> 01:08:28,539
You decided that we need to
wait for court action.

533
01:08:28,751 --> 01:08:31,123
Too little, too late.

534
01:08:32,296 --> 01:08:36,128
Am I crazy?
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.

535
01:08:36,342 --> 01:08:41,549
Three bombs explode at exactly six.

536
01:08:41,764 --> 01:08:44,386
The clock is ticking. You run out of time.

537
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:49,761
Officer Mohideen,
you decide whether this is the last call.

538
01:08:49,981 --> 01:08:54,976
Supplier Thenuwara
arrives there in ten minutes.

539
01:08:55,195 --> 01:08:59,406
He may look like on TV,
that Akthul Majood is dead.

540
01:08:59,616 --> 01:09:02,534
You know what is at stake.

541
01:09:02,744 --> 01:09:06,873
Then I'll tell where the bombs are.

542
01:09:10,711 --> 01:09:13,416
Deputy Chief.

543
01:09:14,256 --> 01:09:18,124
The situation is not under control.

544
01:09:18,344 --> 01:09:21,261
Should I call the Prime Minister?

545
01:09:23,391 --> 01:09:27,341
This will be the consequences.

546
01:09:27,562 --> 01:09:32,354
It's too late to worry about it.
Sir.

547
01:09:32,567 --> 01:09:35,687
What if something goes wrong?

548
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:43,696
Right.
These are going to a funeral.

549
01:09:46,665 --> 01:09:50,248
I have been here since the beginning.

550
01:09:50,461 --> 01:09:54,921
The feeling is mutual.
Forgot your cell phone.

551
01:09:55,132 --> 01:09:58,169
Take it for him, Victor.
Wipe it.

552
01:09:58,385 --> 01:10:02,134
Prime Minister's hands must remain clean.

553
01:10:04,809 --> 01:10:07,098
Hello.
- Where are you?

554
01:10:07,311 --> 01:10:13,065
At the airport. What blew up?
- It'll be fine.

555
01:10:13,276 --> 01:10:16,894
Go next to the runway.
- Okay. Let's go!

556
01:10:17,113 --> 01:10:21,241
Mohideen, remember that you are a police officer.

557
01:10:21,451 --> 01:10:24,452
Sir!
- Mohideen? Can you hear me?

558
01:10:24,663 --> 01:10:27,415
Sir!
- Mohideen?

559
01:10:27,624 --> 01:10:30,376
Hello! Sir!

560
01:10:36,175 --> 01:10:39,923
Ranjan ! Ranjan, do not do it!

561
01:10:44,517 --> 01:10:49,226
Ranjan, no!
We have to take him back.

562
01:10:49,438 --> 01:10:51,645
No!

563
01:10:53,651 --> 01:10:56,937
Ranjan! Do not do it!

564
01:10:57,155 --> 01:11:02,280
Ranjan, stop it!
I will not let you do that.

565
01:11:49,584 --> 01:11:56,121
Terrorist trying to escape
Jayaweera and Mohideen work.

566
01:11:56,341 --> 01:11:59,710
The prisoners were transferred for security reasons.

567
01:11:59,887 --> 01:12:04,134
During the transfer, they were able to free
and hijacked the aircraft.

568
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:08,561
Officer Jayaweera and I
to stop them.

569
01:12:08,771 --> 01:12:14,014
The prisoner tried to escape.
We had to shoot him.

570
01:12:15,945 --> 01:12:19,813
Oh, my God!
- Thank you, Mr. AP.

571
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:26,074
It was a pleasure to work with.
- Where the hell are the bombs?

572
01:12:28,833 --> 01:12:32,000
This is a live broadcast of the Katukurundasta.

573
01:12:32,212 --> 01:12:37,088
The terrorists tried to escape.
All four were killed.

574
01:12:37,843 --> 01:12:41,793
Why they were brought here?
Where they were going to go?

575
01:12:45,976 --> 01:12:50,104
Miss Dilky,
I have news for you.

576
01:12:50,314 --> 01:12:55,142
Dilky, Dilky? Can you hear me?
- Yes.

577
01:12:55,361 --> 01:12:58,944
I live on.
- I know Dilky.

578
01:12:59,157 --> 01:13:01,695
I know that you are describing.

579
01:13:01,868 --> 01:13:06,446
Tell the viewers,
where the other three are the bomb.

580
01:13:06,664 --> 01:13:11,789
Listen carefully, I will say this only once
. Three bombs.

581
01:13:11,962 --> 01:13:16,090
Bus. Pettah Matthegodaan.

582
01:13:18,218 --> 01:13:20,507
Number 32

583
01:13:20,721 --> 01:13:25,347
Train. At seven o'clock train Galle.

01:13:26,226 --> 01:13:31,185
Mall. O'Dells, 1 layer.

585
01:13:33,776 --> 01:13:37,441
None of them explode.

586
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:42,700
Take care of yourself, Dilky.

587
01:13:42,869 --> 01:13:45,276
Thank you.

588
01:13:51,711 --> 01:13:54,249

Stay tuned. Dilky Thenuwara

590
01:14:20,658 --> 01:14:25,865
What is this?
The train is stopped.

591
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,283
Call me back then.

592
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:32,038
Do not worry about it.

593
01:14:32,253 --> 01:14:36,121
Are you ready?
I need an image quickly!

594
01:14:36,883 --> 01:14:39,837
This does not work, sir.

595
01:14:40,053 --> 01:14:44,051
How so?
- I'm sorry, sir.

596
01:14:46,393 --> 01:14:50,972
What is that building?
Is he in there?

597
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:53,941
What happened?

598
01:14:54,151 --> 01:14:57,816
You said that you are able to do this.

599
01:15:00,407 --> 01:15:05,283
Can not you find him
whether or not you want to find?

600
01:15:16,508 --> 01:15:21,668
Am I the only one who wants to capture the
of the man?

601
01:15:41,367 --> 01:15:43,774
I understand.

602
01:15:53,129 --> 01:15:55,834
I understand.

01:18:48,645 --> 01:18:52,689
What time is it?
My watch has stopped.

604

Have you been shopping?

605
01:19:27,018 --> 01:19:31,146
Did you get everything you asked for?

606
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:35,691
Why are not you answering?

607
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:38,731
Are you on your way home?

608
01:19:38,905 --> 01:19:41,859
