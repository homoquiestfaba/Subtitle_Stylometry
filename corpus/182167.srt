1
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,360
Have you ever witnessed
Frank Mantajano kill anyone?

2
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,600
I've heard about it,
but it's not an everyday occurrence.

3
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,120
- Have you witnessed him kill anyone?
- People say things. You pick up on it.

4
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,840
It gets around the block.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Have you ever witnessed Frank
Mantajano in any kind of illegal activity?

6
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,400
Have you ever witnessed him
in any kind of illegal activity?

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,120
Again, as far as I'm concerned,
the guy did right by me.

8
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,320
- Who hired you?
- I would assume it's Frank.

9
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,320
- How long have you worked for him?
- We ran together in younger days.

10
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,600
- How long have you worked for him?
- We dated the same girl.

11
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,040
We had the same friends on the streets.

12
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,360
That kind of stuff. Things happen.

13
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,880
Somebody ordered a takeout.

14
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,800
Good night.

15
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,160
Your answers have to come faster.
This is a federal case.

16
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,240
You've got to have your ducks in a row
if we're gonna nail Frank Mantajano. OK?

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,600
- Can we take a break? I'm hungry.
- OK.

18
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,880
But remember, you're gonna be
on the stand for hours at a time.

19
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,360
You've got to watch your body language,
your facial expressions, your posture.

20
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,360
To be effective, the committee
has to like you. Get it?

21
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,440
I got it.

22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,920
- Got any Szechwan chicken over there?
- Could you get him some chicken?

23
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,800
Mr Paine, does the Attorney General's
office have any final remarks?

24
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,080
May I remind the committee that Frank
Mantajano is an execrable criminal,

25
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,800
moving Cuban organized crime
into America.

26
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,520
I object to that characterization
of my client.

27
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,000
The Attorney General's office is making
accusations, disguising them as truth.

28
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,280
The fact is, my client
has never been convicted of any crime.

29
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,280
- But he will be, Mr Foster.
- That's enough, gentlemen.

30
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,400
This committee will stand in recess
until 10am Monday,

31
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,760
at which time I hope that the Attorney
General's office will have evidence

32
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,280
to back up their accusations.

33
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,400
- I'll produce it all right.
- Good. We're adjourned.

34
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,280
Our witness is dead.

35
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,280
My witness is dead?

36
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,800
- Mantajano's people got to him.
- He was in a safe house. How?

37
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,160
Some Cuban delivered him
a carton of Chinese food full of C-4.

38
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,240
I just told the Committee on Organized
Crime and 60 million TV viewers

39
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,680
that I would produce a witness
in 72 hours.

40
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,320
I understand,
but what are we going to do about it?

41
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,680
"We"? As a federal marshal,
you are directly responsible

42
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,720
for the custody and protection
of all witnesses.

43
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,280
So the problem is,
you got my witness killed.

44
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,440
You do something about it
by Monday morning

45
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,520
or start thinking about
an early retirement.

46
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,160
Sweet little kitty.

47
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,320
Got them virgin hands.

48
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,920
Cute little kitty cat like you
ain't supposed to be shovellin' ditches.

49
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,560
This here is man's work.

50
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,920
Hey, bitch, are you listenin' to me?

51
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,800
You know, I'm lookin' for a little pussy
like you to keep me warm at night.

52
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,040
Now that's using your head. Come on!

53
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,280
Don't you think he's had enough, convict?

54
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,200
You been here one day.
You wanna fight everybody?

55
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,880
- I ain't supposed to be here.
- Ain't nobody supposed to be here.

56
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,640
Break it up!
Get your big ass out of the way.

57
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,760
- Causin' problems already, Piper?
- I had nothin' to do with it.

58
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,280
- It's true.
- Shut up, Dodge.

59
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,800
- Wait a minute.
- I said shut the fuck up!

60
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,440
You guys need an attitude adjustment.

61
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,840
I got just the thing for you.

62
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,920
All right, Kevin.

63
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,680
Kinda like a wedding ring.

64
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,680
I now pronounce you
convict... and convict.

65
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,760
Now get the fuck on the bus.

66
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,000
You move when I say you move.

67
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,160
Right.

68
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,080
Come on.

69
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,440
- Should we break it up now?
- No.

70
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,280
Just keep a lookout
and watch for my signal.

71
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,280
Gimme the keys to the bus.

72
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,300
- What's goin' on?
- How should I know?

73
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,620
Radio for help.

74
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,900
- Let's go.
- I'm not goin' anywhere.

75
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,780
You move when I say you move!

76
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,580
Here, pussy, pussy...

77
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,180
Let's get outta here.

78
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,580
- Anything else, Gib?
- I ain't got nowhere to put it, honey.

79
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,540
- Hey, Gib.
- What's goin' on, Sandra?

80
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,100
You. Lieutenant Clark says meet him
at Gwinnett County Detention Center.

81
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,100
- He say why?
- Nope, but he's waitin' on ya.

82
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,260
How are the ribs today?

83
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,340
Same as they were yesterday,
and the day before, and the day before.

84
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,100
- I'll see ya.
- See ya, Gib.

85
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,180
Get me a half a slab of rib

86
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,260
- and a peach cobbler.
- You got it.

87
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,180
- Hey, Gib.
- Afternoon, Warden. What's up?

88
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,020
Prison break.

89
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,620
- Who fled?
- There's three of 'em took off.

90
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,700
Paul Milliner, Charles Piper
and some kid named Dodge.

91
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,500
Dodge? That explains why
the Lieutenant called me out here.

92
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,820
I busted him about nine months back.

93
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,740
- What's he done now?
- From what we can gather,

94
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,220
Piper and Dodge got into a brawl,
distracting the guard,

95
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,100
and this fuck Milliner
grabbed Kevin's gun.

96
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:46,980
The three of 'em started shootin'. They
killed Kevin, Bailey and two other guards.

97
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,380
- Dodge killed someone?
- Afternoon, Gibson. Warden Nichols.

98
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,620
This is Marshal Schiller,
Attorney General's office.

99
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,380
Welcome to the land
of CNN and Coca-Cola.

100
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:01,220
We don't want to be on CNN and hope not
to get too thirsty capturing these fugitives.

101
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,300
The Marshal will head the manhunt.

102
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,380
Since you arrested Dodge,

103
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,180
you can give Schiller a jump-start
on where to look for these boys.

104
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,100
He's probably headin' back to Atlanta,
about 30 miles from here.

105
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:17,460
If we put out an all-points and local news
profiles, we should have 'em by nightfall.

106
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,940
Let me talk to you for a minute, Matthew.

107
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,980
This guy Schiller is no regular cop. He
was sent by the Attorney General's office.

108
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,060
They want a press blackout on this.

109
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,420
- We do want to catch these boys, right?
- Damn right.

110
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,940
But we don't want police reports
all over the six o'clock news.

111
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:43,220
So I'm supposed to play Seeing Eye dog
to the Attorney General's trigger man

112
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,300
without askin' what, when or why.

113
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,620
My job is to make sure you give
these boys what they need. Are we clear?

114
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,260
- Yeah. We're clear.
- Good.

115
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,900
Now let's get Marshal Schiller
on these fugitives' trail.

116
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,980
Right.

117
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,540
Hold up a second.

118
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,780
Shit. What are you doing?

119
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,420
Shit.

120
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,260
Are you done?

121
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,980
Not unless you wanna
wipe it off for me, convict.

122
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,340
Let's go.

123
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,740
If we position ourselves here,
they'll be cornered.

124
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,060
If we do that, we leave this whole area
along the river open to the city.

125
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,540
I've been doing this ten years.
They're headed for the border.

126
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,940
They want to leave Georgia
as fast as possible.

127
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,740
- Why do you think they're all together?
- Let's mount up and move out.

128
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,820
You heard the man. Let's do it.

129
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,580
Never seen nothin' like it in 20 years.

130
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,740
What's a US marshal
like Schiller doin' here

131
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,420
on a local manhunt
for some minor criminal?

132
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:39,020
These guys shot up a whole road crew.
They should be shot for what they done.

133
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,580
- I'm not sure they done anything.
- What is that supposed to mean?

134
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:47,540
I brought Dodge in for hackin' into
some telephone computer system.

135
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,020
They only gave him 18 months. He's
served nine. Why would he break out?

136
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,820
All I know is he left a good friend of mine
dead out on that road.

137
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,340
That's my point. What was Dodge
doin' there in the first place?

138
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,980
Just a prison ordinance.
A routine directive.

139
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,340
You make the directives, Dale.

140
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,100
Road crews, chain gangs, are reserved

141
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,980
for felons with
five-year sentences or more.

142
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,980
So what was Dodge doin' on that road?

143
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,420
We got a call
from the Attorney General's office.

144
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,500
They wanted Dodge out there.

145
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,980
- Why would they want him out there?
- I don't know.

146
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,380
They've been tryin' to question him
since we had him in lockup.

147
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,220
You got to believe me, Gib.
I had no idea this was gonna happen.

148
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,860
Attention all units. Suspects spotted...

149
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,180
There. Schiller's closin' in on 'em now.

150
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,660
- Stop the car.
- What?

151
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,340
Stop the goddamn car!

152
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,080
- Come on!
- Hold up.

153
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,600
- What's the problem?
- You're draggin' me like a rag doll.

154
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,680
You almost ripped my arm off
twice back there. Shit.

155
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,080
- We gotta get into a rhythm.
- What the fuck you know about rhythm?

156
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,080
- I'm a foster child, raised by the state.
- What's your point?

157
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,960
There was this caretaker who was
like a father to me. His name was Titus.

158
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,480
He taught me that everybody
lives their life according to a rhythm.

159
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,800
You make love to a rhythm.
Your heart beats to a rhythm.

160
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,360
If we're gonna run together,
we gotta get into the same rhythm.

161
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,440
I got your rhythm, convict.

162
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,560
If we hurry, we can get you back
in time for evenin' chow.

163
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,280
Goddamn.

164
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Something's down there. Check it out.

165
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,760
Wait! Look.

166
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,840
- In there?
- Yeah. Let's go.

167
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,880
- How do we get to the state line?
- We don't wanna go there.

168
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,320
Why not?

169
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,960
Come on!

170
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,640
Didn't you see "The Fugitive"?

171
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,360
The first thing Tommy Lee Jones did
was set up roadblocks at the state line.

172
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,040
- That's your plan, Dr Kimble?
- I ain't got a plan.

173
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,480
- I'm trying to figure this shit out as we go.
- No shit!

174
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,240
- All right. I say we give ourselves up.
- What?!

175
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,880
- You're jokin', right?
- I look like I'm jokin'?

176
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,640
- It was your idea to run.
- People shoot at me, I run.

177
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,680
Your white ass didn't know shit.

178
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,120
- So you don't like white people now?
- No, I just don't like you.

179
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,360
I got nothin' against whites. I just ain't
had many good experiences with 'em.

180
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,720
Fuck! I was out in six months.
Six months I was goin' home.

181
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,200
Yeah? Forget about that six months shit.

182
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,680
You can add on another 12 to 18 months
because you ran, no matter what you say.

183
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,720
You are a convict.
Nothing is ever gonna change that.

184
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,920
That's your reality, baby, not mine.

185
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,680
My reality and yours are the same.
We're both fucked.

186
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,760
- Not me. I take my chances.
- Not with my life, you don't.

187
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,080
All right, all right! Hold up.

188
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,280
- How much?
- What?

189
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,360
- Name your price.
- You ain't got shit to bargain with.

190
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,800
- I got more than you think.
- What do you mean?

191
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,680
I'm talkin' about five million dollars.

192
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,800
I got your attention now, convict?

193
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,920
What do you think I was locked up for?
Runnin' a red light?

194
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,640
I hit a major corporation for five million.

195
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,560
- You're lyin'.
- Am I?

196
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,000
All right! Hold on. Why would I lie?

197
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,080
One: to keep me from kickin' your ass.
Two: same reason.

198
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,880
Three: prison life
ain't exactly worked out for you.

199
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,760
That's why I'm offerin' you
a million dollars.

200
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,880
More than you'll ever see in your life.

201
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,920
Yeah. I'll be lookin' over my shoulder
for the rest of my life, too.

202
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,080
What else will you do when you get out?
Work for 7-Eleven?.

203
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,960
They ain't hiring convicts.

204
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,880
You think about that.

205
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,320
- All right, I want half.
- Half? Fuck you! This ain't divorce.

206
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,120
No. We married, baby.

207
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,200
For better, for worse, in sickness
and in health, till death do us part.

208
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,160
The chopper's comin' back around,
Dodge. You better hurry up.

209
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,720
Come on, baby. Say "I do. "

210
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,800
Shit! All right - half.

211
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,880
- But after that, that is it! We are even.
- No.

212
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,240
Now we're even.

213
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,400
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

214
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,880
- Which way?
- This way.

215
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,840
What?

216
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,920
Nothin'.

217
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,440
- What the hell is that?
- Sounds like a train.

218
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,560
Run!

219
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,440
Let's go!

220
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,480
- We won't make it.
- We have to jump.

221
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,200
I can't swim!

222
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,920
I never met a white boy
that couldn't swim.

223
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,440
- Keep your head up.
- OK.

224
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,280
First thing I'm gonna do

225
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,360
when this shit is over

226
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,560
is set my ass

227
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,480
in a steamy, hot, bubble bath.

228
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,800
You know?

229
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,000
I hope you choke
and drown on the bubbles.

230
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,960
What are you doin'
chained to that white boy?

231
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,360
You know, I've been askin' myself
the same damn question all day.

232
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,560
Now look here, chief.
I know what you're thinkin', boss.

233
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,280
You got two convicts. If you turn us in,
maybe you'll make some money.

234
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,360
Might even get your face on TV. Right?

235
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,040
Maybe I oughta shoot your black ass
right now and call it a day.

236
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,560
Why not? In fact, why not have
an old-fashioned lynchin'?

237
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,280
Y'all still hang niggers
in Georgia, dontcha?

238
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,480
He's such a kidder!
Would you excuse me?

239
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,560
- He's got a gun.
- And we don't.

240
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,600
Quit provoking him.
He doesn't want to shoot us. Right?

241
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,480
He won't shoot you, but he damn sure
wants to blow a hole in my black ass.

242
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,920
- Dontcha, boss?
- Hold on. We don't want any trouble.

243
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,160
Don't do anything you'll regret later.

244
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,080
Now, I can see that you're a fine,
upstanding member of your community.

245
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,000
And, despite our appearance,
I can assure you we are not bad people.

246
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,600
- Fuck this. He's a redneck.
- Don't say that!

247
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,520
- He is. Show him your neck.
- Shut up.

248
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,160
Show him your neck!

249
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,480
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- What?

250
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,560
- Didn't you see "Deliverance"?
- We're alive, ain't we?

251
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,520
- What if he'd shot sooner?
- Then we'd be dead.

252
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,280
- Shit.
- What?

253
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,160
- We got a problem.
- What?

254
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,040
He ain't breathin'.

255
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,480
- Shit.
- What?

256
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,560
He's havin' a heart attack.

257
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,560
- Turn the radio down.
- This is a good song.

258
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,320
It'd be nice to hear the cops
before they get to us.

259
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,080
All right, all right.

260
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,200
We gotta get him to a hospital.
Where is it?

261
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,800
It's comin' up. We'll get there.

262
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,520
Where'd you learn first aid, anyway?

263
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,240
In the joint. CPR.
They got courses like that.

264
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,880
A Suzuki.

265
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,920
Nice bikes.

266
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,920
While you take that bubble bath,
I'll get a Ducati 916 racing motorcycle.

267
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,280
- Ride off into the sunset.
- I won't be sorry to see your ass go.

268
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,480
Shit! Look at this.

269
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,880
- Put that away.
- We can shoot the cuffs off.

270
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,640
Don't point it at me!
Gimme that before you hurt yourself.

271
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,080
How would I know?
I never even held a gun.

272
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,360
Then how the helI'd you rob somebody
for five million dollars?

273
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,920
Hackin', my friend. Hackin'.

274
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,200
- Computers?
- You got it.

275
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,280
I got the sweetest Mac 5300.

276
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,560
16 megabytes, 750 hard drive.

277
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,880
So fast, it's like the Ducati of computers.

278
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,120
On the Internet,
my call name is the Cyberthug.

279
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,840
- What's so funny?
- That ain't no robbery, man.

280
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,320
One of these, a ski mask -
that's a robbery.

281
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,880
I didn't get busted for robbery. All right?

282
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,240
I illegally accessed
the phone company's computer system.

283
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,800
- You robbed Ma Bell?
- No, not exactly.

284
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,880
Ma Bell just gave me a little help.

285
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,880
I used the phone company's computer to
access the accounts of a big corporation.

286
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,960
- Which one?
- A greedy one.

287
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,720
They took and never gave back.
I taught 'em a lesson.

288
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,520
- Real nice, but how'd you get the money?
- Once I was in, it was easy.

289
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,600
I transferred money from their accounts
into a dummy company I had set up.

290
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:05,800
I wrote a corporate cheque to a friend.
He closed the account, gave me the cash.

291
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,320
Very smooth.

292
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,400
So who's your friend?

293
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,680
- You writin' a book?
- I wanna know who's sharin' my money.

294
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,400
Everything was planned, sir.

295
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,800
I can't control it if some convict
starts shootin' up the road crew.

296
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,880
He won't be shootin' anybody else.

297
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,480
The most important thing is
Dodge is on the move and we are on him.

298
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,000
The locals have no idea what's goin' on.

299
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,480
Politicians put a lot of pressure
on you with this, huh?

300
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,000
- You mean the Attorney General's office.
- Right.

301
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,360
- Who said I was talkin' to them?
- You just did.

302
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,560
- You think you're pretty smart, don't you?
- Nope. Just average for a country boy.

303
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,280
- Did you notify the fugitive's next of kin?
- They're not a priority on my list.

304
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,360
What exactly is a priority on your list?

305
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,200
Bringing these fugitives to justice.

306
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,840
My hunch is
they're more pawns than fugitives.

307
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,640
It seems to me your hunches are more
like a Hardy Boys mystery than real life.

308
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,600
And I think that
you are spittin' in the wind.

309
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,920
And you know what they say
about spittin' in the wind.

310
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,360
It can blow back in your face.

311
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,760
- Come on. Hurry up, man.
- I'm fixing him so he won't fall over.

312
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,840
Pop the brake.

313
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,320
- Come on, before somebody sees us.
- All right. Ready? One, two, three.

314
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,520
Push.

315
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,520
Shit!

316
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,760
What the hell's wrong with you, kid?
You almost got yourself killed.

317
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,880
Forget that. Why do you guys
have those chains on?

318
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,200
Go on, beat it. You bother me.

319
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,320
- Son of a bitch. They did it!
- What?

320
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,120
They built a recreational centre
and a playground.

321
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,200
- Who?
- Brigantine International.

322
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,080
- That's who I hit for the $25 million.
- You said five, you lyin' SOB.

323
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,840
When I was in their computer system,
I hit 'em for 25.

324
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,640
But I only kept five.
I gave 20 to charity. Like this.

325
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,920
Shit! That's nice, Robin Hood,
but we gotta fled. Come on.

326
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,800
Don't do anything stupid!

327
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,880
- It's OK. Just drive.
- Look, guys.

328
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,520
I have groceries in the back
and about $20.

329
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,480
- Take it and get out.
- You don't tell us. We tell you.

330
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,640
Come on. Put that away. All right?

331
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,560
We don't want your money or your car.
We just want a ride.

332
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,160
- Let's go! Drive.
- All right. All right.

333
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,680
- Where to?
- I don't know.

334
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,120
- Where do you live?
- Three blocks that way.

335
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,360
- OK. We'll go there.
- My house?

336
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,160
- Let's go!
- All right, all right!

337
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,440
But I'm warning you, it's messy.

338
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,920
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

339
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,720
- Workin' hard as usual, Jocelyn?
- Well, not as usual.

340
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,240
And what are you doin' here?
Got a problem with your insurance?

341
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,760
No. I'm here tryin' to figure something out.

342
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,920
- What are you tryin' to figure out?
- Well, I busted this kid, name of Dodge,

343
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,400
for hackin' into
a telephone company's computer system.

344
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,520
They've also listed a bunch of
other companies and different offences.

345
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,480
He used the phone company's computer
to get into other companies' systems.

346
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,040
That's what I figured. But these people
here, Brigantine International,

347
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,360
they didn't list any offences,
nor did they press charges.

348
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,840
- Let me check on Central's computer.
- That would be wonderful.

349
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,720
Someone else accessed
this information today.

350
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,480
- Who was that?
- Savannah Detective Agency.

351
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,360
According to this,
they're a holding company

352
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,080
for corporations with offshore accounts
in Europe and South America.

353
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,840
Can you figure out on that thing
who owns Brigantine International?

354
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,960
The primary stockholder
is a Frank Mantajano.

355
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,120
- Manta-hano.
- Whatever.

356
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,240
Beautiful vessel, isn't she?

357
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,560
- Would you like a drink?
- No. I don't drink.

358
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,640
Tobacco?

359
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,520
I want to congratulate you on your...
Chinese cooking.

360
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,920
I enjoy my work.

361
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,320
We want to commission you
to do another job.

362
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,400
We want you to locate Luke Dodge,

363
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,360
a convict that escaped
from a Georgia prison today.

364
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,520
We need to find him before Monday.

365
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,520
He has a computer disk
that belongs to us.

366
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,400
All of our accounting information
is on that disk.

367
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,120
We want you to retrieve the disk,
then terminate him.

368
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,920
We have a contact in Atlanta
that will provide you with a lead

369
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,520
as to where Luke Dodge might go to first.

370
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,960
It's only for information, Santiago.
He won't get in your way.

371
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,320
It's done.

372
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,440
- Where do you want these?
- In the kitchen.

373
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,400
What a chivalrous convict.

374
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,840
You got something
to cut these cuffs with?

375
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,880
Under the sink.

376
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,160
- Hold the chain.
- All right, all right. Easy.

377
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,920
- Where are you goin'?
- To the bathroom. Do you mind?

378
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,040
- Yes, I do. Wait a minute.
- What?

379
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,800
Didn't you see "The Godfather"?

380
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:28,560
The restaurant scene when Michael blows
everybody's freakin' head off. Forget it.

381
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,120
Go ahead. It's OK.

382
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,480
Thank you.

383
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,560
- What is your problem, man?
- What the hell's goin' on with you two?

384
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,680
First the thing with the gun, now you're
carrying groceries, speaking Spanish...

385
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,840
And then this. Are you a Boy Scout now?

386
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,080
Just cos I been locked up
don't mean I got no manners.

387
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,760
You don't bust into somebody's home
and tell 'em what to do.

388
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,560
She could be in the other room
callin' the cops.

389
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,280
Hold on.

390
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,960
Come on!

391
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,560
I thought you two bandidos
might need a new disguise.

392
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,040
My ex-husband was about your size.

393
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,160
But you...

394
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,080
You might be a little too small for this.

395
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,880
They smell like mothballs because they
were packed away for a very long time.

396
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,600
But they will certainly smell better
than what you have on.

397
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,240
Jesus. What is it?

398
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,840
Thank you.

399
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,720
Where did you get a key for the cuffs?

400
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,000
My ex-husband.

401
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,280
He's a cop.

402
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,520
I wonder what it feels like to want to be
a politician and not hold office.

403
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,400
Like a cop without a job.

404
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,800
I talked to Schiller. You ain't makin'
any friends mouthin' off.

405
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,600
Well, I'm not tryin' to make any friends.
I'm tryin' to do my job.

406
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,200
Oh, yeah? What job might that be?

407
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,800
Say, where are you goin'?
Let me talk to you for a second.

408
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,080
Why do you think the Attorney General
and a US marshal are involved in this?

409
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,000
They're following orders from superiors -
which you can't seem to do.

410
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,600
Would you listen for a sec?

411
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:24,480
Warden Nichols said the Attorney General
had Dodge placed on that road crew.

412
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,840
Plus, Dodge hacked into Brigantine
International's computer system.

413
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,480
- Why don't we have a record of it?
- Because the key stockholder

414
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:37,000
is a Frank Mantajano, who is currently
under indictment by the Attorney General.

415
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,200
So?

416
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,600
So whatever Dodge discovered
inside their computer system,

417
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,640
they wanna keep it secret.

418
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,680
Great police work. Maybe I can
get you assigned to the Hoffa case next!

419
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,760
Henry!

420
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,480
Are you outta your fuckin' mind?

421
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,360
Blanks. Found 'em on the road
where Dodge escaped. Police issue.

422
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,040
It's all right. It's OK.

423
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,040
Listen. I don't have all the pieces
to the puzzle yet, but just think about it.

424
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,280
Dodge makes off with $25 million
of Mantajano's money

425
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,760
and the corporation
doesn't press charges.

426
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,080
This is evidence. Did you tell Schiller?

427
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,480
My guess is he knows. He had Dodge
put on that road so he'd run.

428
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,520
But things went sour. People died.
So Schiller wants this out of the press.

429
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,240
- What the hell does that prove?
- What it proves, right,

430
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,360
is that Dodge has something big
on Mantajano

431
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,000
and the Attorney General wants it bad.

432
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,760
Now, I have got a hunch,

433
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,800
and I need an old friend to turn his back
for 24 hours so I can play it out.

434
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,040
OK, you got 24 hours. Not a minute more.
And, Matthew,

435
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,360
you fuck this up,
friend or no friend, it's your ass.

436
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,760
I know, Henry. Believe me, I know.

437
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,640
So where'd you meet your husband?

438
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,400
Well...

439
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,680
I was sneaking across the border
and he caught me.

440
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,400
So he deported me back to Mexico.

441
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,160
But he asked me for my phone number.

442
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,520
So first, he started calling.

443
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,600
Then visiting.

444
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,400
Then we fell in love and got married.

445
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,000
And he brought me to the States.

446
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,080
First to California.

447
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,800
And then we moved to Atlanta, Georgia.

448
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,760
And then what happened?

449
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,720
He left me.

450
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:04,200
So, I was stuck here with no money,
no friends, no family... and no job.

451
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,300
- So what'd you do?
- I cried.

452
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,060
I cried for a long time.

453
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,740
Then I got my shit together.

454
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,380
My mother had taught me how to cook.
So that's what I do.

455
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:27,020
- You work in a restaurant?
- No. I'm self-employed. I'm a caterer.

456
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,780
I make my own tortillas
and all the sauces.

457
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,740
That's my speciality - a mole.

458
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,620
- What's mole?
- You wanna try some?

459
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:40,660
Nothin' like real soap
to get that prison stench off you.

460
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,340
You oughta try some.

461
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,100
So, did you ask her?

462
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,260
- Ask her what?
- You know.

463
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:54,420
- No, I don't know.
- You don't remember? Scrub-a-dub-dub.

464
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,700
- Go ahead. Go on, ask her.
- Ask me what?

465
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,100
- Nothin'.
- You got nothin' to be ashamed of.

466
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,180
That's right. I'm a grown man.

467
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:04,660
All day long he's been talkin'
about wanting to take a bath

468
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,900
with some Mr Bubble, the one kids love.

469
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,820
- That's foul.
- I didn't know you were so sensitive.

470
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,140
- You guys know each other before jail?
- No.

471
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,020
- Became friends inside?
- We ain't friends.

472
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,540
Cell mates?

473
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,780
Just asking.

474
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,340
Hey, where do you think you're goin'?

475
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:31,180
You want your cut of the money?
Then I got some business to take care of.

476
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,660
Now I got a plan.
You'll just have to trust me.

477
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,260
Trust you?

478
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,940
All right.

479
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:42,180
See this? My daddy gave me this when
I was eight years old. I'm givin' it to you.

480
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,300
You better make damn sure I get it back.
It's for good luck.

481
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,940
You try to fuck me, I will find you.

482
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,300
Santiago. Have your playmates arrived?

483
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,020
- Yes, they have.
- Have you received my fax yet?

484
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,780
- Yes, I have.
- The one fault that is universal to men

485
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,860
is our love of women.

486
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:14,820
Find her, and you'll find Luke Dodge.

487
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,900
Just make sure you have the disk,

488
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:21,340
or be certain no one else can get it
before you do away with Dodge.

489
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:27,020
I find the girl, we get to Dodge,
and if he doesn't have the disk

490
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:31,300
- we kill him.
- Si. In that order.

491
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,360
Are you raiding my private files?

492
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,480
I gotta get to Puffy.
Now's the time he's on the Pyramid Web.

493
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,000
- Hasn't he caused enough trouble?
- Yes, but he'll get us out of it.

494
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,240
- This is a guy thing, right?
- Right.

495
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,880
- Nice tits.
- I agree.

496
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,400
Knock it off.

497
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,840
OK, here we go.

498
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,120
- I knew he'd be up to no good.
- Puffy, no good: hand in hand.

499
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,400
OK, here we go.

500
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,760
What's up, Puffdawg?

501
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,680
"You're out! How do I know it's you?"

502
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,840
Do you want me to tell you
at what age you stopped wetting the bed?

503
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Jerk.

504
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,040
"You do that and you won't get
the surprise I've got for you. "

505
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,120
Then we should meet.

506
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,160
"Tonight at the witching hour. "

507
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,640
Where?

508
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,440
"I've got a jonz in my bonz
and I need a fortune cookie"?

509
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:30,120
It's our code. It means meet at midnight
at the Tokyo Massage Parlor.

510
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,400
- He wants to meet at a massage parlour?
- So what?

511
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:39,080
Baby, if it's a massage you're looking for,
why not let my fingers do the walking?

512
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,200
- I couldn't wait to get you outta that club.
- I had to do something to pay my tuition.

513
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:48,080
Besides, I like being independent
and taking care of myself.

514
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,680
Yeah? Well, I'm gonna
take care of you now.

515
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,080
So where do you wanna go?
Name your place.

516
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,320
Dinner.

517
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,360
Really?

518
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,320
I got a better idea.

519
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,160
Let's order room service
and stay right here.

520
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,560
I guess this is it.

521
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,800
You know where you're going?

522
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,400
I'll play it by ear, see what happens.

523
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,960
You know, I was thinking.

524
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,480
Maybe once you figure out
where you're going, get settled,

525
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,200
maybe you wanna drop me a postcard,
gimme a call.

526
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,440
Well, how can I keep in touch with you?

527
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,880
Here's my phone number
and my address.

528
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,200
I'd like to know you're OK.

529
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,840
Wait. Here.

530
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,400
I thought you might need this.

531
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,920
Maybe you better keep it.

532
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,160
Room service?

533
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,680
No!

534
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,200
Fuck you!

535
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:44,080
You're probably dangling there wondering
how you got into this predicament.

536
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,240
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

537
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,120
- I want the disk.
- What disk?

538
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,440
The disk that you used
to steal $25 million from my employer.

539
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,760
- They would like it back.
- You didn't have to kill her.

540
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,320
You're assuming I have a lot of time.

541
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,320
I don't.

542
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,400
Manny.
