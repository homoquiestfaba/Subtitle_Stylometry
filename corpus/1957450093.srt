1
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,774
(lighthearted music)

2
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,444
(puking)

3
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:19,679
- Are you okay?

4
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,315
Here.

5
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,617
(coughing)

6
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,688
(lighthearted music)

7
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,465
Let me get some water for you.

8
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,266
- Thank you.

9
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,937
- Here, this will make you feel better.

10
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,472
- [Woman] Christopher is a man

11
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:49,441
who's aware of his surroundings.

12
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,976
- Thank you.
- Are you okay?

13
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,377
- Yeah.

14
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,780
- [Woman] Fate tore them apart.

15
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,283
Destiny brought them together.

16
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:01,254
(lighthearted music)

17
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:13,819
- No!

18
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,826
(dramatic music)

19
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,275
(knocking)

20
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,443
- Christopher?

21
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,512
Do you ever answer your phone?

22
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,081
- I don't want to talk to him.

23
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,450
- You look like hell.

24
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,452
Why aren't you ready?

25
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,653
- I'm not going into work today,

26
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:48,755
I'm not feeling well.

27
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,057
- Yeah, this is probably
why you're not feeling well,

28
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:52,959
you drink too much.

29
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,561
- Look, I only had a couple, all right?

30
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,630
- We missed you last night.

31
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,631
- Sorry.

32
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,536
- You've been late with your columns.

33
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,772
If you don't watch it,
you're gonna get fired.

34
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:07,839
I mean, I understand that, you know,

35
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,907
Savannah died six months-

36
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,075
- Will you shut up, please?

37
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,076
Just...

38
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,245
Just...

39
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,448
- Sorry.

40
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,321
- Is six months enough for you?

41
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,824
I spent 22 years with her, 22!

42
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:27,993
I miss her.

43
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,228
I loved her so much.

44
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,098
- I didn't mean...

45
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,235
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to make matters worse.

46
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,907
Listen, but I was reading
your last article,

47
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:42,975
"The Singing Forest".

48
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,144
Very interesting.

49
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,452
About how searching for your soul and...

50
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,120
Do you really think people can connect

51
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,455
with their past lives?

52
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,490
- Yeah, some people can.

53
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,193
The psychic I interviewed
for this column last month

54
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,096
told me things not even Savannah knew.

55
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,997
And she donates her time to the police

56
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,433
to help solve crimes.

57
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,001
She helped me.

58
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:13,472
She took me back, to a
Nazi concentration camp

59
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,707
in the middle of the forest.

60
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,943
It's funny, because as she was talking,

61
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,711
I can see everything
she was talking about,

62
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,980
it was so clear.

63
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,884
But who's to know what's real.

64
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,255
(dramatic music)

65
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,146
- What were you doing in the camp?

66
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,849
- It's a little confusing, but,

67
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:02,621
she said I was helping
to hide and feed the Jews

68
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,457
who were being persecuted by the Nazis.

69
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,360
I was part of a Jewish
underground resistance group,

70
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,661
the Chug Chaluzi.

71
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,130
And we hid and fed Jews in the churches

72
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,734
to keep them from being
sent to concentration camps.

73
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:20,473
She kept referring to me as "Jo".

74
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,876
- As in Joe and John?

75
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,879
- No, as in J-O, Jo.

76
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,617
Anyway, after I became
the head of the resistance

77
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:36,021
I was captured when
another group was betrayed

78
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,757
shortly before the
Russians liberated Berlin.

79
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:39,992
I was tortured and hung.

80
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,194
- She told you this?

81
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,462
- Yeah.

82
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,629
- And you believed her?

83
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,164
- After telling me things only I know,

84
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,767
you're damn right I believe her.

85
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,641
Listen, tell the boss I'll be
going out of town for a while.

86
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:57,609
- Where out of town?

87
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,113
- Just out, to see my daughter, Destiny.

88
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:04,382
- I never knew you had a daughter,

89
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,284
and I've known you for many years.

90
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,187
- I'm a private person, you know that.

91
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,123
She's getting married next week.

92
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,525
- You never told me
anything about a daughter.

93
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,594
- Nevermind that!

94
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,529
Look, she turns 22 next week,

95
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,298
and she's getting married on her birthday.

96
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,269
- Look, Chris, I'm very
happy for you, I mean...

97
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,437
And you should be happy for her,

98
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,072
that's why you need to sober up,

99
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,406
you need to clean yourself up.

100
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,407
I mean...

101
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:32,778
I gotta go.

102
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,046
I've gotta turn in some
artwork to a client.

103
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,749
- Okay, I'll call you later.

104
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,351
- Keep your chin up.

105
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,419
- Yeah, thanks.

106
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,264
(thunder rumbles)

107
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,566
- Hi, honey, we're home!

108
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,504
- Hey.

109
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,171
You finally made it.

110
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,008
Come on in, I got stuff on the stove.

111
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,113
- God, he looks so familiar.

112
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,582
- Let me help you with that.

113
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,384
- I know we usually eat out,

114
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:14,319
but this is a special occasion, right?

115
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
- Yeah.

116
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,857
- [Ben] Excuse me, sir,
can you hand me that plate?

117
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,359
- Please, call me Christopher.

118
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:23,695
- Christopher.

119
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:25,530
You okay?

120
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:26,698
- Yeah.

121
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,834
I'm just glad Destiny's
done so well for herself.

122
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:31,269
- [Destiny] Thanks, Dad.

123
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,238
- Make yourself comfortable.

124
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,538
Dinner's almost ready.

125
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,373
- Yeah, sure.

126
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,308
- Oh, come with me.

127
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,810
It is time for the tour guide.

128
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,183
- How about a little champagne

129
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,320
to celebrate your arrival?

130
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,391
- [Christopher] Thank you.

131
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,660
- Oh, I forgot the salt.

132
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:56,529
- Oh, don't worry.

133
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,529
I'll get it.

134
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:00,533
- So, mister...

135
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,467
Christopher.

136
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:03,402
How was your trip?

137
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:04,470
- Pleasant, thank you.

138
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,472
So, how long have you known my Destiny?

139
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:11,209
- Um, seems like we've known
each other all our lives.

140
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,012
We've been together about three years now.

141
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,615
- Destiny tells me you're a model.

142
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,183
- As in a citizen?

143
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,018
I don't think so.

144
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,019
I'm a good example not to follow.

145
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,321
- You're perfect, sweetie.

146
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,226
Everything looks so wonderful.

147
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,362
- Thank you.

148
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:30,729
- You're a good cook.

149
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,763
- Thanks.

150
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,699
- So, honey, how was your photo shoot?

151
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,101
- I've been meaning to
talk to you about that.

152
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,037
It was good, and some of the guys

153
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,773
want to take me out tomorrow night.

154
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,641
- Mm.

155
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,544
I forgot, the bachelor party.

156
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:50,516
- [Ben] But if you want,
we can hang out tomorrow.

157
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,052
- Yeah, sure, I like that idea.

158
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,454
- Hm, how about a toast?

159
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,190
To family.

160
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,725
- What no one shall separate.

161
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:01,560
- [Christopher] Cheers.

162
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,560
- Cheers.

163
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,532
(dramatic piano music)

164
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,335
Good show, don't you think?

165
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,504
- Interesting.

166
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,908
- She always does this,
I've seen this film already.

167
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,510
But don't worry, I won't
ruin the ending for you,

168
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,379
it's best if you figure
it out for yourself.

169
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,681
- She's always slept like this in my lap,

170
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,350
ever since she was a little baby.

171
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,225
- I'm glad you're here.

172
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,795
- I'm happy to be here.

173
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,737
- See you tomorrow, bright and early.

174
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,041
- Bright and early it is.

175
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,011
- Dad?

176
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,012
- Hm?

177
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,081
- I've gotta go to work now.

178
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:30,916
Okay, there's coffee on the stove,

179
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,283
and bagels and fruit in the fridge,

180
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,319
so you help yourself to
anything you want, okay?

181
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,223
- [Christopher] Thanks, sweetheart.

182
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,762
- I'm so happy you're here.

183
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,464
Okay, I left my work number on the fridge,

184
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,399
so you call me if you need anything, okay?

185
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,335
- I'm sure I'll be fine.

186
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:51,936
- Okay.

187
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,273
I'm gonna be home late
from work again tonight.

188
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:58,376
Ben's getting ready to
take you around, though.

189
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,111
You guys have fun, okay?

190
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,613
- Yeah, we will.

191
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,981
- Okay.

192
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:03,982
Bye.

193
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,753
(waves crashing)

194
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,857
(lighthearted music)

195
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:21,567
- I love coming here.

196
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:23,601
It's very relaxing.

197
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,570
And every time I feel down,

198
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,973
or I just want to clear
my mind, I come here.

199
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,142
- I know how you feel.

200
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,111
Nature has a way of putting us here

201
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,814
and sometimes forgetting about us.

202
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:37,782
Ben...

203
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,920
Do you believe in reincarnation?

204
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,289
(waves crashing)

205
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,125
- You mean like dying and coming back?

206
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,694
- Yeah, something like that.

207
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,796
- I don't know, I never
really thought about it.

208
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,198
Why?

209
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,267
- 'Cause you remind me of someone that...

210
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,971
- That what?

211
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,072
- Nevermind.

212
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:01,907
- No, what?

213
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,508
- No, it would sound nutty, it's-

214
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,876
- No, go ahead, tell me.

215
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:05,877
I'm all ears.

216
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,513
- Okay.

217
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,950
Have you ever had an experience

218
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,718
where you feel like you've met someone

219
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:16,087
at another time or another place,

220
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:18,923
and then all of a sudden
you see that same person

221
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,159
in a different place?

222
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,862
- No. (laughs)

223
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,064
Hey, that's kinda weird.

224
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,733
- I told you it would sound nutty.

225
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,336
(waves crashing)

226
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:34,372
- Yeah, you know, I think
there's that TV show, "Sights".

227
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,007
Yeah, they had this
one story about a ghost

228
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,542
who took possession of
one of the family members

229
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,010
who lived in this house.

230
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,479
I mean, in no time at all, an uncle,

231
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,214
or I think it was a cousin,

232
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,184
he was running around acting like a ghost.

233
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,052
I mean, they have pictures
of it and everything,

234
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,053
it was freaky.

235
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:52,457
Christopher.

236
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,260
Hello? (claps)

237
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,094
Christopher?

238
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:55,928
- Yeah.

239
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:58,096
- Are you all right?

240
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,464
You kinda spaced out for a minute there.

241
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,165
- Yeah, I was thinking.

242
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,901
- Oh, great.

243
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,037
- I was thinking of
how miraculous life is.

244
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,071
You know, it's the little things

245
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,541
that make me stop and
wonder about our existence.

246
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,412
You know, like, even though
science is improved now,

247
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,848
you have to stop and
wonder how every object

248
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,950
like an airplane can fly through thin air,

249
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:23,956
or an ocean liner can float on
something as light as water.

250
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,090
Isn't that incredible
how nature prepares us

251
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,027
to deal with our own...

252
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:34,799
It's like our souls are driving
vehicles of flesh and blood.

253
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,569
You know, we cut ourselves, we bleed,

254
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:41,940
and our bodies would heal
the wound or the sickness,

255
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,808
or sometimes they...

256
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:47,178
(drowned out speaking)

257
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,747
- I try not to think too
much about that stuff.

258
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:50,582
All right?

259
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,883
Life is too short as it is,

260
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,685
I don't think we have
enough days on the planet

261
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,955
to even begin to figure all that out.

262
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,691
- There's got to be a
higher power at work.

263
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,695
When my wife died, I didn't want to live.

264
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,097
I felt empty.

265
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,134
There was a time I allowed
myself to waste away.

266
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,670
I just sat in my house and did nothing

267
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:16,441
until one morning I woke up and felt like

268
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,242
I needed to continue living,

269
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,979
not for my sake, but for
those who care about me,

270
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,314
those who need me.

271
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:27,085
- Look, I don't like to say I understand,

272
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,420
'cause I really don't.

273
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,222
Okay, I can't imagine
the pain and suffering

274
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:34,560
that comes with losing someone so close.

275
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:40,331
Someone you spent most
of your whole life with.

276
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:45,337
- Sometimes I open my eyes,
I'm in a different time,

277
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:49,775
a different place, floating through,

278
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,878
just waiting for the
next time I open my eyes.

279
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,648
(waves crashing)

280
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,417
- Yeah.

281
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:04,056
It's getting dark, we should go.

282
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,228
(dramatic music)

283
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,263
(catchy music)

284
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,399
- I'm just trying to make sense as to

285
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,267
why you feel the need to-

286
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,435
- Watch out, watch out!

287
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,038
Why don't you watch where you're going?

288
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,307
- Look, it wasn't meant to be.

289
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,076
- Look, would you stop it with that?

290
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,345
Christ, I've heard enough, okay?

291
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:37,282
I'm not some crazy ghost
from the spirit world.

292
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:39,818
I'm from Des Moines.

293
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,420
- I'm sorry if I...

294
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:43,821
I'm sorry.

295
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:47,558
- Look, let's just keep it here, on Earth.

296
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,559
Okay?

297
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,863
- Listen, I didn't mean to piss you off.

298
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,366
- I know, I know, you're
just making conversation.

299
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:57,368
I mean...

300
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,539
We all have habits, all right?

301
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,510
That we either need to
control or quit altogether.

302
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,379
- What does that mean?

303
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,514
- Look, I'm...

304
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,820
I mean, what is it with
you and this, you know?

305
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,388
I mean, God!

306
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,389
- What?

307
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:20,925
We need to go, you're gonna be late

308
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,561
for your night out with your friends.

309
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:26,298
(dramatic music)

310
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,333
- I'm going to get ready.

311
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,070

Now it's your turn.

329
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:16,467
- We're playing spin the
bottle without a bottle.

330
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,569
- Now, snort up!

331
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,006
- Happy trails!

332
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,074
You feelin' it?

333
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,577
- By the way, where are all the strippers?

334
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,949
Aw, you guys have a perfect
replacement for the strippers.

335
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:32,818
- I do.

336
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:34,552
We sure do.

337
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:38,056
(catchy electronic music)

338
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,594
- Here's to the groom to be!

339
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,764
Just relax, buddy.

340
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,099
Look ahead.

341
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,602
The strippers are dancing!

342
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,875
- Guys, I don't feel so well,

343
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:01,912
and I'm pretty sure
Steve's just on the bench.

344
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:03,814
(laughing)

345
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:06,585
(wondrous music)

346
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:35,740
- I'm sorry.

347
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:37,742
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

348
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,311
- It's okay.

349
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,080
I'm here now.

350
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,450
Hold me.

351
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,158
- From the first time I saw you,

352
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:56,293
I knew it was you.

353
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,676
Good morning, I made you coffee.

354
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:13,677
- Hm.

355
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,314
What happened?

356
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,284
- I don't know, you tell me.

357
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:21,619
- Mm.

358
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,088
I don't know.

359
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,489
I just remember being at Bill's,

360
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,625
and then I blacked out.

361
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,295
Why am I naked?

362
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:35,232
We didn't, um...

363
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,233
I mean...

364
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,270
Nothing happened, right?

365
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:43,842
Mm!

366
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:44,676
- Shit, I'm sorry.

367
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,044
Let me put some cream in it.

368
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,312
Oh, shit!

369
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,754
- Where did you learn to
make such great coffee?

370
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,323
- I just added a few of your mother's

371
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:01,392
secret ingredients to her recipe.

372
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,393
- Oh.

373
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:05,729
Mm, I am so sorry.

374
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,431
It was crazy at the office.

375
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:08,899
Two coworkers called in sick,

376
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,534
leaving me with this pile of work,

377
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:11,870
all of it due this morning.

378
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:14,339
I tried to call late last night,

379
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,639
but I guess you guys were sleeping.

380
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,642
- Yeah, I went to bed early.

381
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:20,377
- I'm so tired.

382
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,915
All I want to do is curl up on this couch

383
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,251
and go to bed.

384
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,552
But I took the rest of the day off

385
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:30,120
so that I could be with you.

386
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:30,956
- You didn't have to do that,

387
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:32,823
I know how important your job is to you.

388
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:34,058
- Oh, nonsense!

389
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,528
I still have so much stuff
to do for the wedding.

390
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:39,396
I still have to get a wedding dress.

391
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,332
I was kinda hoping maybe
you'd help me with that.

392
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,333
- Sure.

393
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,636
- And maybe while we're there we can

394
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,638
just pick out your tux.

395
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:48,707
- Sounds like a plan.

396
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,328
Alexander, is that you?

397
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,066
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.

398
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:17,502
- Who's Alexander?

399
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,170
What time is it?

400
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,207
- It's almost 1 o'clock.

401
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,143
Destiny's asleep on the couch.

402
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:31,082
- Look, I wanted to
apologize, for yesterday.

403
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,050
- No, no, nonsense.

404
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:34,318
You certainly did nothing wrong,

405
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,155
it was me who was out of line, so.

406
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,591
- I feel like shit.

407
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,593
- (laughs) You're not alone.

408
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,929
(chuckling)

409
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,634
What's so funny?

410
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,770
- Me.

411
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,172
Waking up in your bed.

412
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:58,108
I was fucked up.

413
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,576
- Don't worry about it.

414
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:00,611
If it'll make you feel any better,

415
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:01,946
it'll be our little secret.

416
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:10,487
- Why do I feel like I've
known you for quite a while?

417
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:11,488
- Maybe you have.

418
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,794
So, what are the plans for today, hm?

419
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,796
- I don't know.

420
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,364
Is there something you'd like to do?

421
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,365
- Not really.

422
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,589
Do you want me to make
you something to eat?

423
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:29,606
- Yeah.

424
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,277
How about some bagels with
strawberries and cream cheese?

425
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,645
- Great.

426
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:35,846
Anything else?

427
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:36,781
- No.

428
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:37,916
But I'll take a shower.

429
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:39,951
And some coffee?

430
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:41,352
- Sure, coming up.

431
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,601
(phone ringing)

432
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,006
Hello?

433
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,643
Uh, he's in the shower, who's calling?

434
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:08,078
Yeah, hold on.

435
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,815
(shower running)

436
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:13,317
Ben?

437
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,027
- Can I get out?

438
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,132
- Yeah, it's Bill.

439
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,266
- Okay.

440
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:32,871
Tell him I'll call him back.

441
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:37,541
- Uh, yeah, Ben can't talk right now,

442
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:38,910
he said he'll call you back.

443
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:40,811
Yeah.

444
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,683
- Can I get a little privacy, please?

445
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,819
- Yeah, sure.

446
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,820
I'll...

447
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,825
Sorry, I'll just be making your bagels.

448
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:57,828
- Okay.

449
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,855
You know I'm getting married.

450
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:25,856
- Yeah, I know.

451
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:30,861
- Who's Alexander?

452
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,397
- Why do you want to know?

453
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,165
(chuckling)

454
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,067
- Because you've been
calling me Alexander,

455
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,636
and I want to know why.

456
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,538
- You wouldn't understand.

457
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:41,538
- Try me.

458
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,742
- He was someone I knew some time ago.

459
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:48,847
- Do I look like him?

460
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:51,982
- We were very close.

461
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:53,116
- How close?

462
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:54,117
- Very.

463
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:56,086
- How long ago?

464
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,722
- From my past life.

465
00:30:58,723 --> 00:30:59,790
- Jesus Christ!

466
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,625
- Look, would you believe it if I told you

467
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:04,061
he was in my dreams even
before Destiny was born?

468
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,996
I saw him over, and over, and over.

469
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,498
I just didn't know what
the connection was.

470
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:09,499
- You gotta give this up,

471
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,701
this is messing with your head.

472
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,536
- It's true!

473
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,136
I met with a psychic for my last column

474
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:14,938
and she confirmed everything.

475
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,039
- This is ridiculous!

476
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,309
- And she even told me
I'll find him again,

477
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,111
and she told me we were related.

478
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:22,880
- Did she tell you how crazy this sounds?

479
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:23,815
I mean, Christ, Christopher!

480
00:31:23,816 --> 00:31:25,449
Listen to yourself.

481
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,150
Okay, let me see if I got this straight.

482
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:29,953
You're telling me that I'm
some kind of born again soul-

483
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:33,090
- Why is this so hard
for you to imagine, huh?

484
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,825
Didn't you say you also saw some things

485
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,793
you couldn't understand?

486
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,929
If everything is so okay with you,

487
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,699
then why are you trying to
hard to escape from reality?

488
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,434
- No one's trying to escape from anything.

489
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,737
- Then why the drug habit?

490
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,605
Huh, why?

491
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:48,539
Why the drug habits?

492
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,740
Tell me, talk to me, damn it!

493
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,377
- I don't want to get
into this again, okay?

494
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:56,546
Listen to me.

495
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:57,916
We're about to be related.

496
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,653
And I want to have a good
relationship with you.

497
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,988
But I'm not some old ghost from your past

498
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:05,823
who's back to haunt you,

499
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:07,759
nor am I some former lover of yours.

500
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,027
Okay?

501
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:12,930
You need to put things into perspective.

502
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,865
You need to differentiate
between fantasy and reality.

503
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:17,268
- Yeah, I do have things in perspective.

504
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,671
All I know is I'm not the
one trying to force myself

505
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:21,705
into a fantasy world.

506
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,274
A very dangerous one, I might add.

507
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,442
- Look, why don't we just
forget this, all right?

508
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,643
- I didn't bring it up, you did.

509
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:28,780
- Well, just leave it alone.

510
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,249
- Ben, why are you so afraid of?

511
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,786
What?

512
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:39,157
- I'm afraid to see you screw up my life.

513
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,994
- Ben, I'm not here to
mess with your head.

514
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,165
- It seems like it.

515
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:53,371
- I've gotta go get ready,

516
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:54,973
I'm going out with Destiny soon.

517
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:57,674
- Christopher?

518
00:32:58,609 --> 00:32:59,609
- Yeah?

519
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:04,582
- I'm not Alexander.

520
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:08,986
- Yeah.

521
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,800
- Dad, please pass the carrots?

522
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:24,801
- Sure.

523
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:30,375
(dog barking)

524
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,452
- So, honey, how was your day?

525
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,601
- It was good, it was good.

526
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:48,726
(dog barking)

527
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,728
- "So, Destiny, how was your day?"

528
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:52,563
Oh, my day?

529
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:54,664
Honey, great, thanks for asking.

530
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:55,799
Let's see, what did I do today...

531
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,636
I got a wedding dress,

532
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,806
and I got my dad fitted for a tux.

533
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:06,510
Oh, yes, I went to your secret
hideaway place on the beach.

534
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:09,013
(dog barking)

535
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:13,283
Okay, what is going on here?

536
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:14,886
Why is this awkward?

537
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,257
Who wants to go first?

538
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:23,994
(dog barking)

539
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,863
- There's nothing going on here, right?

540
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,365
- Right.

541
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:30,701
- Okay, fine.

542
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:32,636
Since there's nothing going on here...

543
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:33,737
How 'bout dessert?

544
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,572
Does anyone want dessert?

545
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:35,739
We're having shit pie.

546
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,774
- I'll have some dessert.

547
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,910
- Me too.

548
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,111
- Do you want me to help you?

549
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:43,614
- [Destiny] No, why don't you
stay and get reacquainted?

550
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,019
- Did you call Bill?

551
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:50,420
- Um, yeah.

552
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,356
He just wanted to make
sure I made it home okay.

553
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:54,357
- I see.

554
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,734
- So, we have a lot of
RSVPs for the wedding,

555
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:07,037
I think we're gonna have a full church.

556
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,407
- Will any of your family
members be attending?

557
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:16,513
- Excuse me.

558
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:28,392
- Both his parents died in a car accident.

559
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,061
- I didn't know that.

560
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:32,062
- It's okay.

561
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,732
I don't think he's gotten over it.

562
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:41,838
Don't worry about it, Dad.

563
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:42,973
- Yeah.

564
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,643
- Don't worry, give him some
time, he'll come around.

565
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,379
- Um, has he...

566
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,517
What about the rest of his family?

567
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,687
- As far I know, he's an only child.

568
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,525
I know he had a really
rough childhood though.

569
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,427
His parents adopted him when he was 5.

570
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:07,264
- Has he ever tried to find out

571
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,499
who his real parents are?

572
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:11,968
- I don't know.

573
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:12,803
- Well, have you encouraged him to-

574
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:14,238
- I try to stay out of it.

575
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,542
- That must be hard on him.

576
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:19,709
- I'm sure it is.

577
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:25,849
- Can you imagine not
knowing where you come from

578
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,118
or who you really are?

579
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:32,290
(phone ringing)

580
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,226
- Hello?

581
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,728
Hey, Jennifer, how you doin'?

582
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,499
Uh huh, she does?

583
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,436
That's great, that is great.

584
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,639
Okay, when?

585
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:52,743
Does it have to be tonight?

586
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,315
Okay, okay.

587
00:36:58,182 --> 00:36:59,550
All right, make it an hour.

588
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,119
That was my office.

589
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:07,224
They need me to come in, it was a client,

590
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,061
it was a proposal that we
submitted this morning and...

591
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,064
I gotta go.

592
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,001
I hate to leave you and Ben.

593
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:20,238
- Don't worry about
it, we'll be all right.

594
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:22,939
- It's just that...

595
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,008
With this wedding and the
client and everything,

596
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:27,143
I feel like I'm not spending
enough time with Ben.

597
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:28,144
- Don't worry.

598
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:31,916
I'll find something for us
to do until you get home.

599
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,119
It's okay.

600
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,120
- Thanks, Dad.

601
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,994
(lighthearted piano music)

602
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:45,061
I miss mom.

603
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:48,832
I wish she were here.

604
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,501
- Yeah, I miss her too.

605
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:55,973
- What do you think she'd be doing

606
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:57,274
if she was here right now?

607
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,609
(chuckling)

608
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,911
- Well, I know she'd be very
excited about your wedding.

609
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,781
She'd be here helping you
pick out wedding invitations,

610
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,249
helping you shop for your dress,

611
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,653
throwing you a big bridal shower.

612
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:15,559
But watching you turn
into a grown up woman,

613
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:18,996
mostly, she'd be very proud.

614
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:24,035
Very proud, as I am, to be here with you.

615
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:27,203
- Dad...

616
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:42,118
I've never told anyone this,

617
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:47,124
but sometimes I can feel her presence.

618
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:52,996
Sometimes I can smell the
perfume she used to wear.

619
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,132
That rose, do you remember that?

620
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:02,873
I remember everything about her.

621
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:08,578
Her hair, her skin, the way it felt.

622
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,114
Her blue eyes, her smile.

623
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,484
(dog barking)

624
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:22,660
She always thought I could
have the world if I wanted it.

625
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:27,331
I owe you both for everything that I am.

626
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,701
- This is not the time to get emotional.

627
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,473
You've got to go to work, and I've...

628
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:38,875
I've gotta go apologize

629
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,545
to a certain special person in our lives.

630
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,281
- You're right.

631
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,452
Oh, god, look at the time, I have to go.

632
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:51,122
- Go, go, it's okay.

633
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:59,130
Savannah, are you here?

634
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:05,335
Are you listening to your daughter?

635
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:08,839
(melancholic piano music)

636
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,062
- Um...

637
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:36,433
I've been acting like an asshole lately,

638
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,436
and I want to apologize.

639
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:44,041
- No, I apologize asking
about your parents.

640
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,011
I wasn't aware that...

641
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,081
- Don't worry about it.

642
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,086
- Water under the bridge?

643
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:58,154
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

644
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:04,494
You've gotta give Destiny a
hand, she's quite a worker.

645
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:06,029
I don't know how she does it.

646
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,530
She's planning the wedding,

647
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:10,734
juggling a high pressure
job, she's amazing.

648
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:14,337
- What's amazing?

649
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:16,473
- You are amazing.

650
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,508
- No, I'm not.

651
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,779
I'm just some regular guy.

652
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,483
- No, you're not just a
regular guy, you're my family.

653
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,151
- Cheers to that.

654
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,152
- Cheers.

655
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,155
- Question.

656
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,155
- Yup?

657
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:33,923
- What was he like?

658
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,159
- Who?

659
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:38,561
- Alexander.

660
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,164
(chuckling)

661
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,832
- Well, now that's a loaded question.

662
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:43,900
- It was just a question,

663
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,068
you don't have to answer
if you don't want to.

664
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,471
- No, no, it's not a problem.

665
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:55,346
My recollection of us meeting is at a bar.

666
00:41:55,613 --> 00:42:00,016
I remember the Nazis keeping
this bar "The Owl" open,

667
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,753
to corral some of the Jews.

668
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:07,090
If they presumed you were Jewish,

669
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:10,528
they took you to these barracks
marked with pink triangles.

670
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:18,968
To many, they applied
the Paragraph 175 law.

671
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:21,005
- What's Paragraph 175?

672
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:26,709
- It was a law in Germany at the time

673
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:31,715
that prohibited people from
engaging in homosexual acts.

674
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,487
If you were presumed to be
gay you were imprisoned,

675
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:42,693
or used as a guinea pig
in government experiments.

676
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:47,830
You know, back then
Germany considered women

677
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:50,800
as reproductive vessels
to fill the country

678
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:52,769
with more citizens,

679
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,539
thereby making it a stronger nation.

680
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,208
- Sounds like a nightmare.

681
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,843
Sounds like my childhood.

682
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:02,046
- Tell me about it.

683
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,782
- My childhood?
- Yeah.

684
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:09,853
- Hopping around from home to home.

685
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:12,690
Shipped around, just...

686
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:16,392
I don't know, place to place.

687
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:20,763
But eventually a place with a family,

688
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:24,802
and they treat you nice,
send you to school,

689
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,772
teach you the importance of
doing what you believe in.

690
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:34,243
I always wanted to be a performer, so,

691
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:39,249
I'm in this showcase and
this guy approaches me,

692
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:42,920
offers me a job in New York.

693
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,290
And the rest is history.

694
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,291
- Cheers to that.

695
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,132
- And you?

696
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,600
What was your childhood like?

697
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,970
- I had a very abusive father.

698
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:04,875
He always beat my mother and
blamed her for my mistakes.

699
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:07,243
- How so?

700
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:14,484
- My father thought that
I wasn't good enough

701
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,686
to face the world.

702
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:21,558
That basically I was worthless.

703
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:26,664
Nothing I ever did was
good enough for him.

704
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:33,370
So, then I met Savannah.

705
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:37,675
We both ran away from home, we eloped.

706
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:41,078
- And what was she like?

707
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,148
- She was beautiful.

708
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:47,117
Inside and out.

709
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:52,256
She was a very generous,
very giving woman.

710
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:56,193
She always believed in people.

711
00:44:58,462 --> 00:44:59,930
She believed in me, for one.

712
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:02,533
- What do you mean?

713
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:07,771
- We didn't meet under
the best of circumstances.

714
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:13,042
I was angry at my father
for beating my mother

715
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:16,180
and kicking me out of the house.

716
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:22,252
Nothing I ever did for
him was good enough.

717
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:29,793
Anyway, I was drunk and
looking to show him that

718
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:34,364
I could control someone,
that I could be a man.

719
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,735
That I could be just like him.

720
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:44,240
- What happened?

721
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:48,579
- Savannah was coming from
the library when I saw her.

722
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:54,384
She was so beautiful.

723
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:00,090
I followed her and...

724
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,994
(ominous music)

725
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:20,576
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

726
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:21,711
- That's okay.

727
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:24,447
Tonight's our night to celebrate.

728
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,448
- Celebrate what?

729
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:27,583
- Surviving.

730
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:31,346
- [Christopher] We're
already drunk as it is.

731
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:35,158
- Well, now it's time
to get really wasted.

732
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,192
- [Christopher] I don't
think I can drink anymore

733
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:37,660
without getting sick.

734
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:39,762
- Come on, one more, for me.

735
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:42,365
- No, I can't, it's-
- Come on!

736
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,700
- Ah, okay.

737
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:45,536
- Do the countdown.

738
00:46:45,537 --> 00:46:47,738
Three, two, one...

739
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:53,744
See?

740
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:54,578
Not so bad.

741
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:56,412
- Whoa, I don't like to mix alcohol.

742
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:57,247
- Let's do another one.

743
00:46:57,248 --> 00:46:59,917
- Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

744
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,656
(puking)

745
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:07,891
- Are you okay?

746
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:11,794
Let me get you some aspirin.

747
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:14,631
(heavy breathing)

748
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:18,467
Here.

749
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:20,269
Here.

750
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:29,413
You okay?

751
00:47:29,414 --> 00:47:30,514
- Yeah, yeah.

752
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:44,093
Where do we go from here?

753
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:45,362
- I don't know.

754
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,172
- I'm in bed with my future...

755
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,776
Are you okay with this?

756
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:03,012
- Are you?

757
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:06,617
(dramatic classical music)

758
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:41,550
- Dad?

759
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:48,824
Ben?

760
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:49,660
- [Ben] What, what?

761
00:48:49,661 --> 00:48:51,662
- [Christopher] Destiny!

762
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:53,796
- I'm sorry.

763
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:55,532
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

764
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,979
(waves crashing)

765
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:25,462
(lighthearted music)

766
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:01,298
- I love coming here.

767
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:03,232
It's very relaxing.

768
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:08,871
Every time I feel down or I
just want to clear my mind,

769
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:09,872
I come here.

770
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:13,109
- I know what you mean.

771
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,510
Nature has a way of putting us here

772
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,279
and sometimes forgetting about us.

773
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:21,217
Ben, do you believe in reincarnation?

774
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:22,418
Do you believe in reincarnation?

775
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:25,187
Do you believe in reincarnation?

776
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:28,792
(dramatic classical music)

777
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:44,107
(heavy breathing)

778
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:53,416
No!

779
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:01,425
(heavy breathing)

780
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:05,128
(dramatic music)

781
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:14,938
(heavy breathing)

782
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:24,381
- What, what?

783
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:25,381
- Destiny!

784
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:48,638
- Let's go for a drive.

785
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:55,178
(dramatic string music)

786
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:12,055
Can I speak to Charlie Osborne please?

787
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:15,358
Hi, Charlie.

788
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,295
My name is Ben Ross, I'm a
friend of Christopher Hayes.

789
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:20,362
Yeah.

790
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:23,466
And I got your number from
the magazine here, X4.

791
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:27,603
I was wondering if you
could put me in contact

792
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:29,806
with an Elvia Flores.

793
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:34,377
He interviewed, yes, yes,
for "The Singing Forest".

794
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,249
Yes.

795
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:42,785
Thank you.

796
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:53,430
(dramatic music)

797
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:29,231
(knocking)

798
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:30,232
Hello?

799
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:34,803
Hi, are you Elvia Flores?

800
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:36,338
- That's my name.

801
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:37,573
- Do you have a minute?

802
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:39,041
- I'm sorry, I'm with someone right now.

803
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:39,976
- It's really important.

804
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:44,046
Do you remember a man by the
name of Christopher Hayes?

805
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,481
- His name sounds familiar.

806
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:47,583
- He interviewed you
regarding an article he wrote,

807
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:49,118
"The Singing Forest".

808
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,586
- Yes, I remember.

809
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:53,522
I don't know how long I'm
gonna be with my guest,

810
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:55,057
this could take a while.

811
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:56,058
- I can wait.

812
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,495
I don't mind, really.

813
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:00,330
- Okay, come on in.

814
00:55:00,331 --> 00:55:03,966
As soon as I'm finished, I'll talk to you.

815
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:06,736
(dramatic music)

816
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:38,600
Keep the faith.

817
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,169
Please, have a seat.

818
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,171
- Thank you.

819
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:46,141
- What is so urgent you
need to talk to me about?

820
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:48,110
- Christopher Hayes spoke
to you some time ago

821
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:51,613
of a certain recollection
of memories he's having?

822
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:52,915
- I remember.

823
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:55,718
Christopher is a man who is
aware of his surroundings

824
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:57,252
when most are asleep.

825
00:55:57,253 --> 00:56:00,889
He's developed a sensibility
to connect with his past life,

826
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:02,257
therefore avoiding the pitfalls

827
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:04,193
most of us fall into.

828
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:07,529
- I need to know if I'm
the one he keeps seeing.

829
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,531
- I can't tell you that.

830
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:10,599
- Why?

831
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,068
- I never talk to others about
anyone else but themselves.

832
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:15,471
I do it out of respect and courtesy.

833
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:16,505
- Please?

834
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:17,506
I need your help.

835
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:19,709
- I could read you.

836
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:21,610
- Okay.

837
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:28,150
- Do you believe in fate?

838
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:29,151
- Yes.

839
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:31,954
- You're about to get married.

840
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:33,122
- Yes.

841
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:34,723
Yes, I am.

842
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,625
- You have found your soulmate.

843
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:38,227
- I have.

844
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,029
- You two love each other very much.

845
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,265
Fate has town you apart.

846
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:45,401
However, you must unite with destiny,

847
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,436
that is your fate.

848
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:49,004
- Thank you.

849
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:50,639
- Be in tune with your spirit

850
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,408
and you will see how everything works out

851
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,209
for you and yours.

852
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:57,479
In two stories, there are
usually three realities.

853
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,916
Yours, theirs, and what really happens.

854
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:03,719
But who's to say what's
happening from what's not?

855
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,021
We might not be able to
control circumstance,

856
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:09,159
but we can control our actions
and act on our feelings.

857
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,227
You're hurting inside,

858
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:14,063
but don't let destiny pass you by.

859
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:17,801
I think you'll be able
to figure the rest out.

860
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:20,703
You've been here before.

861
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,106
Go and have a happy life
with your loved ones.

862
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,108
- Thank you.

863
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:40,790
(toy box music)

864
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:44,394
- I'm sorry.

865
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:51,867
I tried calling her job,

866
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:53,837
she hasn't been there since that night.

867
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:57,339
- What did you say?

868
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,042
- She took a leave of absence.

869
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:02,711
- What are you doing?

870
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,346
Are you leaving?

871
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:07,816
- It was wrong of me to come
here in the first place.

872
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:09,151
Scary is I haven't seen my daughter

873
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,252
since she left for college,

874
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:12,488
and this is what I do to her?

875
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,590
I just hope that she
can forgive me some day.

876
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:18,961
- I don't think you're
resolving anything by leaving.

877
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:21,630
- My father was right.

878
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,299
I'm not good enough.

879
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:25,267
- What do you mean?

880
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:29,671
Do you know how many
people's lives you touch

881
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:30,672
with your writing?

882
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:36,144
Like mine.

883
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:40,182
- You read my article?

884
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,084
- Yes.

885
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:43,285
I had to see for myself
what you were talking about,

886
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:45,387
so I went to see her.

887
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:48,290
- [Christopher] What happened?

888
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:52,094
- We spoke, and I think
you're right about this lady,

889
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:53,662
there's something very real about her,

890
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:56,833
and I believe her.

891
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:01,136
- Well, I'm not so sure about any of this.

892
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:03,873
(dramatic music)

893
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,888
The cab should be here any minute.

894
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:29,398
- I hate to see you go, I feel
like this is all my fault.

895
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,966
- We can't keep blaming ourselves,

896
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:32,634
what happened is done.

897
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:34,870
- I'm glad to see that you...

898
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:36,872
You know, we were drunk and-

899
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:38,441
- It's pretty clear what I saw.

900
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:40,576
- I believe you.

901
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,745
- No, I don't want you or Ben to leave.

902
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:49,585
I thought about this.

903
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,420
- And what?

904
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,254
What do you want me to do?

905
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:53,322
I'll do whatever you want.

906
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:55,357
- You're the only man I have ever loved

907
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:56,459
in my entire life.

908
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:00,529
I just want you to love me.

909
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,264
- I love you.

910
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:04,299
- But how can I compete with your desires?

911
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,535
- I love you, I-

912
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:08,204
- What about my father?

913
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:12,375
- You're a part of me,
and I'm a part of you.

914
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:16,813
I would never do anything
to hurt you, never.

915
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:19,581
It's all my fault.

916
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:22,117
I think I've caused enough
trouble around here.

917
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:23,118
- No, wait.

918
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:31,426
I've thought about this.

919
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:33,228
You came here to walk me down the aisle

920
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:35,932
to the only man I have ever
loved in my entire life.

921
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,870
And that's what I want you to do.

922
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:45,941
Okay?

923
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,612
- We can't pretend this didn't happen.

924
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,483
- It happened.

925
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:58,154
I don't have anyone left.

926
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:01,824
You both are my family.

927
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,294
And I'm not about to give up on you,

928
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:08,296
either one of you.

929
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:13,202
(dramatic music)
(sobbing)

930
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:29,918
- Are you ready?

931
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:30,919
- Whenever you are.

932
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,691
- So, tell me about the
people you've helped.

933
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:39,127
- I never talk to others about
anyone else but themselves.

934
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:40,930
I do it out of perspective courtesy.

935
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:44,833
- Sounds like you have
many great stories to tell.

936
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:47,703
- Actually, I do have a story to tell.

937
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,037
Now, I'm not going to name any names

938
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,573
of the living involved in
this tragic love story,

939
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:53,309
so, feel free to write it.

940
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:56,412
It's about an unborn
spirit called Destiny.

941
01:01:57,947 --> 01:01:59,114
- [Charlie] What do you
mean an unborn spirit,

942
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:00,549
was she aborted?

943
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,850
- No.

944
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:04,420
She a product of rape, a miscarriage.

945
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:09,591
Destiny united two old
souls from their past life.

946
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:11,993
Fate tore them apart.

947
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:14,796
Destiny brought them together.

948
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:17,567
(dramatic music)

949
01:03:39,382 --> 01:03:41,951
(somber music)
