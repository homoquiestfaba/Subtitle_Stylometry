1
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:39,356
These are the true events
of November, 1965--

2
00:00:39,435 --> 00:00:41,993
The la Drang Valley of Vietnam-- 

3
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,631
a place our country
does not remember...

4
00:00:44,707 --> 00:00:47,140
in a war
it does not understand.

5
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:50,706
This story's a testament
to the young Americans...

6
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,713
who died in the Valley of Death...

7
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,216
and a tribute to the young men
of the Peoples Army of Vietnam...

8
00:00:55,283 --> 00:00:58,219
who died by our hand
in that place.

9
00:01:00,523 --> 00:01:03,457
To tell this story,
l must start at the beginning.

10
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,194
But where does it begin?

11
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,126
Maybe in June of 1954,
when French Group Mobile 100... 

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,069
moved into the same
Central Highlands of Vietnam...

13
00:01:16,138 --> 00:01:18,572
where we would go 11 years later.

14
00:04:16,485 --> 00:04:19,249
Maybe the story
begins in America...

15
00:04:19,322 --> 00:04:23,189
when the army first realized a new
kind of war was coming its way. 

16
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:25,819
The White House anticipates
a buildup and wants a victory...

17
00:04:25,894 --> 00:04:27,829
over cavemen in black pajamas.

18
00:04:27,896 --> 00:04:30,456
We wouldn't be there if they hadn't
already beaten the French Army.

19
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:33,468
The French Army?
What's that? 

20
00:04:33,536 --> 00:04:36,766
The problem in Vietnam is terrain--
jungles, mountains, rivers.

21
00:04:36,838 --> 00:04:38,271
Maneuver's a nightmare.

22
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:41,673
We have a plan to use helicopters--
leap in and out of battle.

23
00:04:41,744 --> 00:04:43,735
They want you
to run the test on the idea.

24
00:04:43,812 --> 00:04:46,543
It'll take a hell
of a combat leader.

25
00:04:46,615 --> 00:04:49,105
I know a young light colonel
named Hal Moore.

26
00:04:49,185 --> 00:04:51,119
He led a combat company in Korea.

27
00:04:51,187 --> 00:04:53,848
After that, he volunteered
to test experimental parachutes.

28
00:04:53,923 --> 00:04:57,552
Experimental parachutes?
Sounds like just the guy.

29
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:02,086
The other side of the mountain
was all that he could see

30
00:05:02,163 --> 00:05:06,122
Was all that he could see
Was all that he could see

31
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:11,298
The other side of the mountain
was all that he could see

32
00:05:11,374 --> 00:05:15,071
The bear went over the mountain
The bear went over the mountain

33
00:05:15,144 --> 00:05:16,576
The bear went over the mountain

34
00:05:16,644 --> 00:05:20,240
How about we go back to ''Bingo''?
What do you say? ''Bingo.'' 

35
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:23,509
B-l-N-G-O

36
00:05:23,586 --> 00:05:25,247
B-l-N-G-O

37
00:05:25,321 --> 00:05:27,312
B-l-N-G-O

38
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:29,754
And Bingo was his name-o

39
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:50,735
Tom, how much you know
about our new colonel?

40
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:52,403
He was in Korea...

41
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,846
has a master's in international
relations from Harvard.

42
00:05:54,915 --> 00:05:58,375
Harvard? He's not one of those
academic pussies, is he?

43
00:05:58,454 --> 00:05:59,887
Hal Moore?

44
00:05:59,954 --> 00:06:02,115
Want me to get one of those?

45
00:06:52,798 --> 00:06:56,199
Come on, Too Tall.
Gimme your best shot!

46
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,737
Did you see that, sports fans?
Did you see that?

47
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:03,331
Snakeshit drives that one
to the moon, baby!

48
00:07:03,408 --> 00:07:05,899
Hit the cutoff man!
Hit the cutoff man!

49
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:08,173
And he's coming around!

50
00:07:08,247 --> 00:07:11,375
- Here he comes!
- No, he's not.

51
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:17,848
You're out!
You're out!

52
00:07:17,923 --> 00:07:21,187
Horseshit! No wonder you can't fly.
You can't see.

53
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:25,562
I believe you're out.

54
00:07:32,838 --> 00:07:35,500
- You're a pilot?
- Too Tall, sir.

55
00:07:35,574 --> 00:07:38,509
- Yeah, I can see that.
- You call, we haul.

56
00:07:41,245 --> 00:07:43,180
- Can I speak to you, Crandall?
- Yes, sir.

57
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:45,375
- Out.
- Safe.

58
00:07:45,451 --> 00:07:47,509
- Out.
- Safe.

59
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:51,322
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Sure.

60
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:52,822
Thanks.

61
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:56,122
So, your men
call you ''Snakeshit.''

62
00:07:56,194 --> 00:07:59,891
That's an affectionate appellation
of my comrades-in-arms, sir...

63
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:01,990
'cause I fly
lower than snake shit.

64
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:06,060
Well, I got a problem, Snakeshit,
and I think you're the solution.

65
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:08,663
I've been called a lot of things,
Colonel, never a solution.

66
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,300
You know what air cavalry
really means?

67
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:15,675
You fly into hostile territory,
outnumbered, 10,000 miles from home.

68
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:17,942
Sometimes the battleground's
no bigger than a football field.

69
00:08:18,016 --> 00:08:22,350
And if the choppers stop comin',
we all get slaughtered.

70
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,355
Now, I figure chopper pilots
won't fly into hell for strangers...

71
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:27,949
so... I'm Hal Moore.

72
00:08:28,026 --> 00:08:30,119
I know, sir.
Why us?

73
00:08:31,362 --> 00:08:35,423
Well, you guys look like shit,
but your equipment is immaculate.

74
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,461
Yesterday was Sunday. You didn't
have to be training, but you were.

75
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:41,369
You got pilots
like that Too Tall character.

76
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,466
He's way outside the limits
of army regs.

77
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,975
They wanna fly with you
for some reason.

78
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:48,979
I guess it's 'cause
they think you're the best.

79
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:51,605
It's 'cause I only recruit
the dumb ones, sir.

80
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:57,721
I don't suppose
I have a choice in all this.

81
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,485
You sure don't.

82
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:03,221
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

83
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,783
To the Air Cav.

84
00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:15,172
Good mornin', Sergeant-Major.

85
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,206
How do you know what kind
of goddamn day it is?

86
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:29,408
Group! Atten-hut!

87
00:09:53,745 --> 00:09:55,836
At ease, gentlemen.

88
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:59,676
Welcome to the new cavalry.

89
00:10:01,186 --> 00:10:03,120
We will ride into battle.

90
00:10:04,423 --> 00:10:07,413
And this... will be our horse.

91
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,743
You don't have to catch it.
You don't have to feed it.

92
00:10:37,355 --> 00:10:38,879
But I can assure you...

93
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:44,258
that neither the new technology
nor your status as officers...

94
00:10:44,326 --> 00:10:46,658
will keep you above the danger.

95
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:51,894
Sergeant-Major Plumley and I
come from the paratroopers...

96
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:55,565
where the offiicer is always
the fiirst one out of the plane.

97
00:10:56,642 --> 00:10:58,576
Because to follow
your instincts...

98
00:10:58,644 --> 00:11:01,668
and to inspire your men
by your example...

99
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:07,581
you have to be with them
where the metal meets the meat.

100
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:11,182
Sergeant-Major Plumley
made all four combat jumps...

101
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,816
in the 82nd Airborne
during World War II.

102
00:11:13,892 --> 00:11:15,985
Sicily, Salerno, Normandy...

103
00:11:16,061 --> 00:11:19,120
and Holland,
plus one more in Korea.

104
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:24,125
He answers to me
and to me alone.

105
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:27,134
Now, I hope you gentlemen
like training...

106
00:11:27,205 --> 00:11:29,537
'cause me
and the sergeant-major--

107
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,710
we love it.

108
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:38,341
Three strikes
and you're not out!

109
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:41,350
There is always
one more thing you can do.

110
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:53,964
Here we go, boys.

111
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:56,296
Move! Move! Go! Now!

112
00:11:56,368 --> 00:11:58,495
- Two.
- Let's go!

113
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,504
Three.

114
00:12:00,572 --> 00:12:01,971
We're outta here!

115
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,066
- Pretty good, huh?
- Pretty good.

116
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:09,302
There's only one thing wrong.

117
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:13,681
Be sharp! We will be the best
platoon in this battalion!

118
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,186
Be ready in there!
Let's go! Let's go!

119
00:12:16,254 --> 00:12:18,879
All right!
Your offiicer's dead!

120
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:20,923
- What do you do? What do you do?
- First--

121
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,927
All right, he hesitated.
He's dead. What do you do?

122
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:26,153
- Get off the chopper!
- Get off of the chopper.

123
00:12:35,105 --> 00:12:36,663
Hold off the third one.

124
00:12:37,743 --> 00:12:39,267
Come on in.

125
00:12:39,344 --> 00:12:42,870
Savage, you learn the job
of the man above you...

126
00:12:42,947 --> 00:12:45,278
and you teach your job
to the man below you in rank.

127
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,283
That goes for every man
in this outfit.

128
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,942
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

129
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,682
We'll be landing
under fiire, gentlemen.

130
00:12:54,926 --> 00:12:56,378
Men will die.

131
00:13:03,677 --> 00:13:05,375
Have you said your prayers?

132
00:13:07,682 --> 00:13:09,312
Come on.
I'll say them with you.

133
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:12,509
- Fall in.
- Gimme that bear.

134
00:13:15,225 --> 00:13:18,091
All right.
Ready. Set. 

135
00:13:18,158 --> 00:13:21,596
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost. 

136
00:13:21,663 --> 00:13:24,826
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

137
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:26,798
Blessed art thou amongst women...

138
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,495
and blessed is
the fruit of thy womb Jesus.

139
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:31,298
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners--

140
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,341
Cecile, I don't hear you
praying, honey.

141
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:38,504
I don't wanna be Catholic.
I wanna be a ''Nethodist'' like Mommy.

142
00:13:38,581 --> 00:13:40,480
You do?

143
00:13:40,548 --> 00:13:42,677
And why is that, honey? 

144
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,812
So I can pray whatever I want.

145
00:13:45,788 --> 00:13:47,014
That's a sin.

146
00:13:47,091 --> 00:13:49,024
No, that's not a sin.

147
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:52,288
God just made you hardheaded.
It's not a sin.

148
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,889
I'll tell you what.
You wanna--

149
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:58,456
You wanna pray and thank God
for our family?

150
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:02,836
- Yes, sir.
- That's good. Let's do it.

151
00:14:02,903 --> 00:14:06,432
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

152
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:08,600
Blessed art thou among women... 

153
00:14:08,677 --> 00:14:10,870
and blessed is
the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. 

154
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:18,942
I can hear you laughing,
you know, even in here. 

155
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:21,817
I'm not laughing,
I'm marveling.

156
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:24,153
Marveling? At what?

157
00:14:24,225 --> 00:14:26,557
That you can fiind stubbornness
in your children...

158
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:29,187
and think it comes
from anybody but you.

159
00:14:29,264 --> 00:14:30,697
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

160
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,538
I'll give you something
to marvel at.

161
00:14:39,942 --> 00:14:41,375
He's a wild man.

162
00:14:59,596 --> 00:15:02,293
- When I pray--
- Mm-hmm. 

163
00:15:02,365 --> 00:15:03,798
whatever I want--

164
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,033
I thank God for you.

165
00:15:21,283 --> 00:15:23,216
Beautiful morning,
Sergeant-Major.

166
00:15:23,283 --> 00:15:25,721
What are you,
a fuckin' weatherman now?

167
00:15:28,788 --> 00:15:32,125
Look what I found
for the new baseball player.

168
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:34,596
- Sent us another bunch of offiicers.
- Uh-huh.

169
00:15:34,663 --> 00:15:37,129
Real green.
Gotta train 'em up.

170
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:39,528
Makes me think
I'm starting a new unit.

171
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,692
They sent new rifles too.
The M-16.

172
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:43,701
That's supposed to be
a pretty good weapon. 

173
00:15:43,774 --> 00:15:45,706
Lots of plastic.

174
00:15:45,774 --> 00:15:50,269
Feels like a BB gun to me.
Believe I'll stick with my pistol.

175
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:53,370
You think we're gonna get close
enough to the enemy to use that?

176
00:15:53,447 --> 00:15:54,971
What do you think, sir?

177
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,149
A leader must remain
cool and calm.

178
00:15:58,221 --> 00:16:02,120
And second, he must learn
to ignore explosions...

179
00:16:02,192 --> 00:16:04,990
the heat and dust,
the screams of the wounded.

180
00:16:06,062 --> 00:16:09,653
This is normal on a battlefiield.
Normal!

181
00:16:23,413 --> 00:16:26,504
Fortran, you need to get a company
over to reinforce the left flank.

182
00:16:26,581 --> 00:16:30,177
- Where is that coming from?
- That's our advisors in Vietnam.

183
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,187
The new radio's picking up
atmospheric bounce.

184
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:53,730
When Crazy Horse was a baby... 

185
00:16:57,812 --> 00:17:01,375
he nursed from the breast
of every woman in the tribe. 

186
00:17:03,783 --> 00:17:05,942
The Sioux raised
their children that way.

187
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,423
Every warrior...

188
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,480
called every woman
in the tribe ''mother.''

189
00:17:12,563 --> 00:17:14,961
Every older warrior,
they called him ''grandfather.''

190
00:17:15,028 --> 00:17:18,259
Now, the point here is that
they fought as a family. 

191
00:17:19,932 --> 00:17:21,871
Take care of your men.

192
00:17:22,938 --> 00:17:25,909
Teach them to take care
of each other.

193
00:17:25,976 --> 00:17:27,909
'Cause when this starts... 

194
00:17:29,913 --> 00:17:31,880
each other
is all we're gonna have.

195
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:40,942
- Did you tune that in?
- Yes, sir.

196
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:43,288
Well, that's fiine.
You're my radio operator.

197
00:17:44,923 --> 00:17:47,362
You'll be fiine.
You'll work it out.

198
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:57,192
Any of you sons of bitches
calls me Grandpa...

199
00:17:59,842 --> 00:18:01,708
I'll kill ya.

200
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:27,557
Godboldt, take your boots off.

201
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:29,365
Go on.

202
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:35,134
Everybody, take your boots off.
Everybody.

203
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,403
Socks too.

204
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:52,717
I want you to draw
fresh socks from supply.

205
00:18:52,795 --> 00:18:55,422
Keep your feet
dusted with powder.

206
00:18:59,134 --> 00:19:02,567
Everybody check each other's feet
like Godboldt and me.

207
00:19:04,403 --> 00:19:06,342
Now, that young man's a leader.

208
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:08,000
Yes, sir.

209
00:19:08,076 --> 00:19:11,307
That other fella--
that big, strong one there--

210
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,313
he wants to win medals.

211
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:18,480
Why were you in the back?

212
00:19:18,554 --> 00:19:20,681
Goddamn it,
why were you in the back?

213
00:19:21,757 --> 00:19:23,690
He's eager.

214
00:19:26,228 --> 00:19:29,596
Ladies, I'm really, really glad
you're here today.

215
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:34,900
Some of you are new to the army
and all of us are new to this post.

216
00:19:34,971 --> 00:19:38,461
I thought we'd pool our resources
and cover questions we have.

217
00:19:38,538 --> 00:19:41,765
So, why don't we start
with item number one-- food.

218
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,238
Where's the best place to shop? 

219
00:19:47,615 --> 00:19:49,548
Well, I tried Big Star,
and it's okay.

220
00:19:49,615 --> 00:19:52,748
But I keep thinking my water's gonna
break right in the checkout aisle. 

221
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:59,825
That takes care of food shopping.
So, item number two-- laundry.

222
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:01,363
The base washing machines
don't work.

223
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,692
They're full of sand
from the swamp missions. 

224
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:05,429
I'll take care of that.

225
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,528
- I've already complained.
- We'll just go to the general.

226
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:12,932
In the meantime,
the Laundromat in town's okay...

227
00:20:13,008 --> 00:20:15,499
but they won't let you wash your
colored things in their machines.

228
00:20:15,576 --> 00:20:18,442
- At a public Laundromat?
- Didn't make sense to me either.

229
00:20:18,516 --> 00:20:20,449
I'm telling you, they have
a sign right in the window...

230
00:20:20,517 --> 00:20:21,846
says ''Whites Only.''

231
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,778
- What?
- They mean white people only.

232
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,057
That's awful.

233
00:20:32,961 --> 00:20:36,055
Your husband is wearing the uniform
of a country that allows a place...

234
00:20:37,365 --> 00:20:41,700
to say his laundry's not
good enough, when he could die for--

235
00:20:46,844 --> 00:20:48,970
- I'm sorry. I just--
- That's all right, honey.

236
00:20:49,045 --> 00:20:52,912
I know what my husband's fiighting
for, and that's why I can smile.

237
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,507
My husband will never
ask for respect...

238
00:20:56,317 --> 00:20:58,682
and he'll give respect to no man
who hasn't earned it.

239
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:00,950
The rest of his family
is the same way.

240
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:04,151
Anybody who doesn't respect that
can keep his washing machine...

241
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:06,317
'cause my baby's clothes
are gonna be clean anyway.

242
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,230
Well, I guess that takes care
of item number two.

243
00:21:15,336 --> 00:21:17,101
Are you all right?

244
00:21:17,173 --> 00:21:21,230
I think-- I think
my water just broke.

245
00:21:21,307 --> 00:21:23,778
We're all calm.
We're all calm.

246
00:21:24,846 --> 00:21:27,180
A car! A car!

247
00:22:00,749 --> 00:22:02,682
- Colonel.
- At ease. At ease.

248
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,980
I heard one of my new lieutenants
just became a father.

249
00:22:05,054 --> 00:22:06,988
- I came to say congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

250
00:22:07,824 --> 00:22:09,758
So, I didn't wanna disturb you.

251
00:22:09,825 --> 00:22:12,951
No, it's fiine.
It's all right. Please.

252
00:22:13,028 --> 00:22:14,961
Well, how's your wife?

253
00:22:15,028 --> 00:22:17,624
She's okay. She's okay.
She's sleeping.

254
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,134
So is my daughter.
I just...

255
00:22:21,201 --> 00:22:23,759
wanted to be here for a while
before I held her.

256
00:22:23,836 --> 00:22:26,000
Well, tag her already?

257
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:28,601
- What's that say?
- Camille. Sorry about this, sir.

258
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,336
Don't take that off. Leave that
where it is. That's an order.

259
00:22:33,883 --> 00:22:36,680
- Colonel, may I ask you a question?
- Sure.

260
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:42,817
What do you think about
being a soldier and a father?

261
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:46,250
I hope that being good
at the one...

262
00:22:46,326 --> 00:22:48,317
makes me better at the other.

263
00:22:50,999 --> 00:22:53,298
Why? What about you?

264
00:22:53,365 --> 00:22:56,133
I don't know, sir.

265
00:22:56,201 --> 00:22:58,141
Between college and here...

266
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:01,603
Barbara and I
spent a year in Africa.

267
00:23:03,412 --> 00:23:06,746
We helped build a school
for orphans.

268
00:23:08,413 --> 00:23:11,076
They were orphans because
the warlord across the border...

269
00:23:11,153 --> 00:23:13,086
didn't like their tribe.

270
00:23:16,325 --> 00:23:19,951
I know God has a plan for me.

271
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,758
I just hope it's to help
protect orphans...

272
00:23:25,067 --> 00:23:27,161
not make any.

273
00:23:29,873 --> 00:23:32,900
Well, why don't we ask him?

274
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:35,067
Come on.
Let's go ask him.

275
00:23:40,351 --> 00:23:43,286
Our Father in Heaven,
before we go into battle...

276
00:23:44,317 --> 00:23:47,584
every soldier among us will
approach you each in his own way.

277
00:23:48,788 --> 00:23:50,726
Our enemies too...

278
00:23:50,788 --> 00:23:52,384
according to
their own understanding...

279
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:55,226
will ask for protection
and for victory.

280
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:58,461
And so, we bow before
your infiinite wisdom.

281
00:23:58,534 --> 00:24:00,900
We offer our prayers
as best we can.

282
00:24:01,804 --> 00:24:05,365
I pray you watch over the young men,
like Jack Geoghegan...

283
00:24:05,441 --> 00:24:08,775
that I lead into battle.

284
00:24:08,845 --> 00:24:11,336
You use me as your instrument
in this awful hell of war...

285
00:24:11,413 --> 00:24:13,173
to watch over them.

286
00:24:14,784 --> 00:24:17,083
Especially if they're
men like this one beside me...

287
00:24:17,153 --> 00:24:19,883
deserving of a future
in your blessing and good will.

288
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:24,317
- Amen.
- Amen.

289
00:24:26,595 --> 00:24:29,528
Yes, and one more thing,
dear Lord...

290
00:24:29,596 --> 00:24:31,028
about our enemies--

291
00:24:33,304 --> 00:24:34,737
ignore their heathen prayers...

292
00:24:34,804 --> 00:24:36,863
and help us blow those
little bastards straight to hell.

293
00:24:37,673 --> 00:24:39,141
Amen again.

294
00:24:40,942 --> 00:24:42,375
Amen.

295
00:24:42,442 --> 00:24:43,875
Thank you.

296
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,461
There's one about the kid with the
apple tree, or the flying horse... 

297
00:24:50,537 --> 00:24:54,440
or the fairy tales
with the deer and stuff in 'em.

298
00:24:54,508 --> 00:24:57,170
Daddy, what is a war?

299
00:25:02,346 --> 00:25:04,278
A war is a--

300
00:25:04,346 --> 00:25:06,286
Well, it's--

301
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:13,788
It's something that
shouldn't happen, but it does.

302
00:25:16,192 --> 00:25:18,095
It's when...

303
00:25:18,163 --> 00:25:22,364
some people--
in another country or any country--

304
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:26,961
try to take the lives
of other people.

305
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:29,701
And then soldiers
like your daddy have to--

306
00:25:29,777 --> 00:25:32,336
It's my job to go over there
and stop them.

307
00:25:33,711 --> 00:25:37,844
Are they gonna try to
take your life away, Daddy?

308
00:25:41,989 --> 00:25:44,855
Well, yes, they're gonna try.

309
00:25:44,923 --> 00:25:46,855
But I'm not gonna let 'em.

310
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:49,355
Okay?

311
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:55,557
Can't sleep?

312
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:03,567
The men are so young and--

313
00:27:03,634 --> 00:27:06,298
Now they sent me a new crop
even greener.

314
00:27:07,507 --> 00:27:10,336
When I look at them, I...

315
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:11,900
see our boys.

316
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:15,913
Well, then you're
just the man to lead them.

317
00:27:19,487 --> 00:27:21,420
I guess.

318
00:27:33,596 --> 00:27:36,826
We intend to convince
the Communists...

319
00:27:38,037 --> 00:27:42,941
that we cannot be defeated
by force of arms.

320
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:48,641
l have asked the commanding general,
General Westmoreland...

321
00:27:48,711 --> 00:27:53,585
what more he needs to meet
this mounting aggression.

322
00:27:54,653 --> 00:27:56,711
He has told me...

323
00:27:58,124 --> 00:28:00,884
and we will meet his needs.

324
00:28:02,797 --> 00:28:06,162
l have today ordered to Vietnam
the airmobile division...

325
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:09,431
and certain other forces which
will raise our fighting strength...

326
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,230
from 75,000 to...

327
00:28:12,306 --> 00:28:16,000
125,000 men almost immediately.

328
00:28:17,144 --> 00:28:19,576
Additional forces
will be needed later.

329
00:28:21,315 --> 00:28:23,336
Get out your best dresses,
ladies.

330
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:27,353
They're gonna want to celebrate.

331
00:28:38,596 --> 00:28:43,500
Don't you ever be sad

332
00:28:43,567 --> 00:28:47,663
Lean on me
when the times are bad

333
00:28:50,576 --> 00:28:52,874
I didn't hear the president
mention a state of emergency.

334
00:28:52,942 --> 00:28:54,412
No, he didn't.

335
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,508
Well, without that declaration
our enlistments won't be extended.

336
00:28:58,585 --> 00:29:01,248
I'm sorry, Hal.

337
00:29:01,317 --> 00:29:04,307
Forgive me, sir,
but let me get this straight.

338
00:29:04,391 --> 00:29:07,913
We form a division using techniques
never attempted in battle...

339
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:12,259
against an enemy with 20 years of
combat experience on his ground...

340
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,990
12,000 miles away
from our ground.

341
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:17,865
And right before the army
sends us into the fiight...

342
00:29:17,932 --> 00:29:21,269
they take away a third of my most
experienced men, including offiicers.

343
00:29:21,336 --> 00:29:24,432
I don't like it
any better than you do, Hal.

344
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,144
You saw this coming, didn't you?

345
00:29:29,211 --> 00:29:33,152
Yes. That's why you gave me
that new crop of platoon leaders.

346
00:29:35,221 --> 00:29:37,190
Korea didn't teach 'em anything.

347
00:29:37,257 --> 00:29:39,721
- Politicians?
- Politicians.

348
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:48,663
Hold me, hold me

349
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,862
Never let me go

350
00:29:50,932 --> 00:29:55,499
Until you've told me
told me

351
00:29:55,575 --> 00:30:00,442
What l want to know
and then just hold me

352
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:03,210
Hold me
Make me tell you

353
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:07,412
l'm in love with you

354
00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:15,219
Thrill me, thrill me

355
00:30:16,595 --> 00:30:18,182
Thank you, sir.

356
00:30:18,266 --> 00:30:20,393
By the way, Hal,
since we're being deployed...

357
00:30:20,461 --> 00:30:21,958
they're renumbering the units.

358
00:30:22,036 --> 00:30:23,469
You're now
the commanding offiicer...

359
00:30:23,536 --> 00:30:26,470
of the 1st Battalion
of the 7th Cavalry.

360
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,673
The 7th.

361
00:30:32,144 --> 00:30:34,076
The same regiment as Custer.

362
00:30:38,585 --> 00:30:39,846
Thank you, sir.

363
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,083
Be sensible with your new love

364
00:30:44,653 --> 00:30:46,951
Don't be fooled thinking

365
00:30:47,027 --> 00:30:51,362
This is the last
you'll find

366
00:30:51,431 --> 00:30:54,298
But they never stood
in the dark

367
00:30:54,365 --> 00:30:57,528
With you, love

368
00:30:57,604 --> 00:31:00,574
When you take me
in your arms

369
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:04,971
And drive me slowly
out of my mind

370
00:31:05,045 --> 00:31:07,844
Kiss me, kiss me

371
00:31:07,913 --> 00:31:10,278
And when you do
l'll know

372
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:49,894
Look around you.

373
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:54,730
In the 7th Cavalry...

374
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,798
we got a captain
from the Ukraine.

375
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:01,903
Another from Puerto Rico.

376
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,316
We've got Japanese, Chinese...

377
00:33:04,384 --> 00:33:07,317
Blacks, Hispanics,
Cherokee Indians.

378
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:11,615
Jews and gentiles.

379
00:33:11,692 --> 00:33:14,162
All Americans.

380
00:33:14,229 --> 00:33:17,250
Now, here in the States...

381
00:33:17,326 --> 00:33:20,490
some men in this unit...

382
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:24,971
may experience discrimination
because of race or creed.

383
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:26,971
But for you and me now...

384
00:33:28,605 --> 00:33:30,038
all that is gone.

385
00:33:31,113 --> 00:33:34,604
We're moving into the Valley
of the Shadow of Death...

386
00:33:36,451 --> 00:33:40,317
where you will watch
the back of the man next to you...

387
00:33:40,384 --> 00:33:42,548
as he will watch yours.

388
00:33:42,624 --> 00:33:45,019
And you won't care
what color he is...

389
00:33:45,086 --> 00:33:48,548
or by what name he calls God.

390
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:51,566
They say we're leaving home.

391
00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:57,826
We're going to what home
was always supposed to be.

392
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:03,461
So let us understand
the situation.

393
00:34:03,546 --> 00:34:06,480
We are going into battle...

394
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:09,538
against a tough
and determined enemy.

395
00:34:14,518 --> 00:34:17,047
I can't promise you...

396
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:20,355
that I will bring you
all home alive.

397
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,385
But this I swear--

398
00:34:24,864 --> 00:34:28,199
before you and before
Almighty God--

399
00:34:28,268 --> 00:34:30,202
that when we go into battle...

400
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:34,867
I will be the first
to set foot on the field...

401
00:34:36,344 --> 00:34:38,835
and I will be
the last to step off.

402
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:44,672
And I will leave no one behind.

403
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:51,157
Dead or alive...

404
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:55,496
we will all come home together.

405
00:34:57,827 --> 00:35:00,355
So help me God.

406
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:28,643
I love you.

407
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,565
Hal, last night the enemy
hit our camp at Plaei Me.

408
00:41:30,637 --> 00:41:32,159
- How many casualties?
- None.

409
00:41:33,438 --> 00:41:35,373
The enemy forces withdrew
toward this mountain...

410
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,068
near the Cambodian border.

411
00:41:37,143 --> 00:41:39,373
How many men do you have
battle-ready?

412
00:41:39,447 --> 00:41:42,242
- Sergeant Major?
- Three hundred ninety-fiive, sir.

413
00:41:42,315 --> 00:41:44,476
Exactly.

414
00:41:44,552 --> 00:41:46,016
What do you estimate
the enemy strength?

415
00:41:46,085 --> 00:41:48,418
We appraise their numbers
as manageable, Colonel.

416
00:41:50,056 --> 00:41:51,489
You have no idea.

417
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:55,085
We have no idea.
Simple orders, Hal.

418
00:41:55,161 --> 00:41:57,527
Find the enemy and kill him. 

419
00:42:00,467 --> 00:42:04,699
They attack us, no casualties.
They run and hide in the mountains.

420
00:42:05,338 --> 00:42:07,273
Naturally we chase them, of course.

421
00:42:08,742 --> 00:42:11,177
Smell like an ambush to you?

422
00:42:11,246 --> 00:42:15,179
They get close enough to kill us,
we'll be close enough to kill them.

423
00:42:19,351 --> 00:42:21,617
Round trip by chopper, 30 minutes.

424
00:42:21,688 --> 00:42:26,351
So the fiirst 60 men on the ground
will be there a half an hour alone.

425
00:42:26,427 --> 00:42:27,860
Son of a bitch.

426
00:42:29,094 --> 00:42:32,655
I think maybe you ought to
get yourself that M-16.

427
00:42:32,733 --> 00:42:36,670
Time comes I need one, there'll be
plenty of'em lying on the ground.

428
00:42:41,775 --> 00:42:45,005
Well, let's go do
what we came here to do.

429
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,512
Yes, sir.

430
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,193
Garry Owen!

431
00:44:11,864 --> 00:44:14,297
lt was a Sunday.

432
00:44:14,367 --> 00:44:17,199
November 14, 1965.

433
00:44:18,371 --> 00:44:21,498
Before that day,
the soldiers of North Vietnam...

434
00:44:21,574 --> 00:44:23,007
and those of America...

435
00:44:23,074 --> 00:44:25,943
never met each other
in a major battle.

436
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:57,271
Two miles out.
Dropping to nap of the earth.

437
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:02,889
First Platoon, let's move!

438
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:17,137
This is Trojan Two. All units
maintain perimeter contact. Over.

439
00:48:21,277 --> 00:48:23,244
It's a scout!
Let's take him prisoner!

440
00:48:24,313 --> 00:48:25,710
Hey! Lieutenant!

441
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,181
There he goes! Come on!

442
00:48:37,891 --> 00:48:39,413
Come on!

443
00:48:39,494 --> 00:48:42,324
Captain, I want you to
keep in contact with all patrols.

444
00:48:44,766 --> 00:48:47,391
Hey, I got something here.
I got a boy! here.

445
00:48:47,469 --> 00:48:48,764
Boy, hell.

446
00:48:48,835 --> 00:48:50,266
That ain't no boy.

447
00:48:55,277 --> 00:48:58,038
- He say he a deserter.
- Bullshit, he's a lookout.

448
00:48:58,112 --> 00:49:00,045
Ask him where his friends are.

449
00:49:06,688 --> 00:49:08,621
He say this is base camp
of whole division.

450
00:49:09,489 --> 00:49:11,353
- Four thousand men.
- Where?

451
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:18,929
That mountain.

452
00:49:27,105 --> 00:49:28,632
Same army destroyed French.

453
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:32,612
And he say they want kill American
very badly.

454
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:34,739
Just not been able to fiind any yet.

455
00:49:34,817 --> 00:49:38,217
Captain Metsker, tell all patrols
to hold their positions.

456
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,949
You, take the radio!

457
00:49:50,864 --> 00:49:53,922
- Where are they?
- Sir, we gotta get that guy!

458
00:50:00,306 --> 00:50:02,070
Call in all the patrols!

459
00:50:02,141 --> 00:50:05,407
We have to engage the enemy
as far away from the LZ as possible!

460
00:50:09,248 --> 00:50:11,181
Net Call, Net Call,
this is Trojan-Two.

461
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:13,311
Grab the wounded!
Break contact!

462
00:50:14,353 --> 00:50:16,980
Fall back!
Get to high ground!

463
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:19,820
Cover fiire!
Get to high ground!

464
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,291
Come on!

465
00:50:31,505 --> 00:50:34,527
Come on! Get up here!
Bring the wounded up to the middle!

466
00:50:34,608 --> 00:50:36,335
Move it, move it!

467
00:50:36,411 --> 00:50:38,710
Cover fire! Cover fire!

468
00:50:41,949 --> 00:50:44,541
Everybody down! Down!

469
00:50:47,554 --> 00:50:50,614
Check your ammo!
Everybody check ammo!

470
00:50:57,998 --> 00:50:59,931
Come on!
I'll get us out of here!

471
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,492
Grab the wounded!
We'll make a run

472
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:05,663
- Sarge!
- We gotta get out of here!

473
00:51:07,275 --> 00:51:10,574
Stay down! Don't anybody move!

474
00:51:10,643 --> 00:51:12,335
Bungum, stay down!

475
00:51:24,556 --> 00:51:26,083
You're gonna be okay.

476
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:30,728
Stay down.

477
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,322
Form a perimeter!

478
00:51:33,402 --> 00:51:36,699
Conserve your ammo and stay down!

479
00:51:38,835 --> 00:51:41,273
What's happening with those patrols?

480
00:51:41,342 --> 00:51:45,244
I'm trying to reach them, sir!
This is Trojan-Two! Come in! Over!

481
00:51:45,313 --> 00:51:48,942
Hey! Hey! Calm down!

482
00:51:49,016 --> 00:51:52,346
Understand the situation
and communicate clearly!

483
00:51:56,623 --> 00:52:00,219
Pull the chain on all the fiirepower
you can get on that mountain!

484
00:52:00,295 --> 00:52:02,954
Alert Crandall!
We have a hot LZ!!

485
00:52:03,027 --> 00:52:05,585
Agent Serpent-Six,
this is Trojan-Two.

486
00:52:05,663 --> 00:52:08,498
You're coming into a hot LZ.
We are taking fire.

487
00:52:08,567 --> 00:52:10,503
Repeat.
We are taking fire.

488
00:52:11,605 --> 00:52:13,038
No shit.

489
00:52:14,275 --> 00:52:16,766
This is Too Tall
goin'down and dirty.

490
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:24,277
Roger that!
Trojan-Two, out!

491
00:52:24,353 --> 00:52:26,978
Herrick's platoon
is cut off and under attack.

492
00:52:27,054 --> 00:52:28,487
Bravo Company's holding.

493
00:52:29,556 --> 00:52:31,489
They're gonna try and flank us.

494
00:52:39,902 --> 00:52:41,960
On the ground now! Move!

495
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:45,969
- Watch him!
- We gotta go.

496
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:47,438
We're outta here.

497
00:52:47,507 --> 00:52:50,237
They're coming at us
from the back now! Move!

498
00:52:56,282 --> 00:52:57,717
Savage.

499
00:53:00,688 --> 00:53:03,085
All right, all right,
I got you.

500
00:53:04,391 --> 00:53:05,483
Sir?

501
00:53:06,594 --> 00:53:09,527
Don't let them
get the signal codes.

502
00:53:10,663 --> 00:53:12,360
Roger that, sir.

503
00:53:17,603 --> 00:53:20,835
I'm glad I could die
for my country.

504
00:53:32,186 --> 00:53:33,516
Doc.

505
00:53:50,536 --> 00:53:52,471
Bungum.

506
00:53:53,538 --> 00:53:54,971
Sarge?

507
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:02,146
Tell my wife...

508
00:54:03,516 --> 00:54:04,949
I love her.

509
00:54:07,554 --> 00:54:08,987
This is Savage.

510
00:54:09,056 --> 00:54:13,686
I need artillery to these
coordinates: niner-3-3-0-1

511
00:54:16,596 --> 00:54:19,527
Ernie! Ernie, help!
We got more coming!

512
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,192
We are cut off.
Copy? We are cut off.

513
00:54:24,739 --> 00:54:26,969
- Fire!
- Fire!

514
00:54:27,038 --> 00:54:29,632
- Fire!
- Fire!

515
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:32,170
They're getting closer!

516
00:54:34,413 --> 00:54:36,610
They're getting closer!
A hundred more, sir!

517
00:54:44,692 --> 00:54:47,681
They're right on top of us, sir!
Bring it in close!

518
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:55,295
It's a hot LZ! We'll be jumping!
We will not touch down.

519
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:10,632
They're trying
to break right through us!

520
00:56:10,699 --> 00:56:14,831
I want you to reinforce
Alpha Company there! Now! Move!

521
00:56:14,907 --> 00:56:17,032
Follow me!
Charlie Company, up on the ridge!

522
00:56:17,106 --> 00:56:21,063
Doc, the wounded are over
by that termite mound! Go!

523
00:56:21,146 --> 00:56:23,871
Sir, if you don't fiind some cover,
you're gonna go down!

524
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:26,474
If you go down, we all go down!
Come on!

525
00:56:42,266 --> 00:56:43,427
Cobain!

526
00:56:43,496 --> 00:56:46,592
I want the M-60 right here!

527
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:54,842
Radio!

528
00:56:57,681 --> 00:57:00,114
Sir, it's Captain Edwards
on the ridge, sir!

529
00:57:01,186 --> 00:57:03,849
- Bob!
- Colonel, these guys are regulars!

530
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,856
Heavily armed!
AK-47s and pouches of grenades!

531
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:10,416
Heavy machine guns
and shoulder-fiired rockets!

532
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,474
Captain Nadal!

533
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:33,447
That creek bed is vital.
Vital!

534
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:36,452
They'll be coming right at you!
Do not let them flank!

535
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:38,715
l repeat, do not let them flank!

536
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,224
Secure the creek bed!

537
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:01,141
Tom, I want you to keep trying
to raise those Medevac boys.

538
00:58:14,056 --> 00:58:16,081
I'm all right.

539
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,092
Charlie, come here.

540
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:21,757
Get me all the air support you
can get me on that mountain! Now!

541
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,925
Requesting immediate
close air support!

542
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:25,864
I need you to burn 'em out...

543
00:58:25,938 --> 00:58:30,340
on hilltop Alpha,
shift to Alpha Bravo!

544
00:58:30,407 --> 00:58:34,606
Coordinates: Golf-4-5-0-9!

545
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:52,994
- Get me something higher up!
- Shifting to hilltop Bravo!

546
00:58:53,063 --> 00:58:56,429
Golf-4-5-7-2!

547
00:58:57,766 --> 00:59:01,465
I say again, 4-5-7-2!

548
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:16,313
Medevac Command of the 7th Cavalry,
are you inbound?

549
00:59:16,385 --> 00:59:18,322
Looks pretty hot down there.

550
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:21,880
Yeah. You can make it, though.
Watch our approach, follow us in.

551
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:25,396
Copy that, 7th Cav.
We will follow your approach.

552
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:46,606
I want you to get over there
and reinforce Charlie Company there!

553
00:59:48,784 --> 00:59:51,688
Medevac, abort! Abort!
This is a hot LZ!

554
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:55,885
You see that? My Medevac guys are
buggin'out and leaving the wounded!

555
00:59:59,331 --> 01:00:00,523
We're going down!

556
01:00:10,507 --> 01:00:13,603
- Snake, get out of here!
- Bring me the wounded!

557
01:00:13,677 --> 01:00:15,235
Wounded! Get the wounded!

558
01:00:15,313 --> 01:00:17,110
Come on! Come on!

559
01:00:22,353 --> 01:00:24,081
Okay, here!

560
01:00:24,155 --> 01:00:27,090
They're still trying to flank us!
Stretch out along the line!

561
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:33,063
Radio!

562
01:00:36,467 --> 01:00:40,266
Trojan-Six! We are in heavy contact!
In danger of being overrun!

563
01:00:40,338 --> 01:00:43,668
lf they get into that LZ,
we've all had it. Can you hold?

564
01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:46,264
We're spread thin, sir,
but we'll give 'em hell!

565
01:00:53,918 --> 01:00:56,853
Crandall, this is Trojan-Six.
lt's too hot down here.

566
01:00:56,918 --> 01:00:59,856
- l'm closing the LZ.
- You copy that, Too Tall?

567
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:01,947
Copy that, Snake.

568
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:04,996
All 7th Cav air units.:
LZ X-Ray is closed.

569
01:01:05,063 --> 01:01:08,226
I don't like it. First time out,
a whole battalion massacred?

570
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:10,458
You think this is a massacre?

571
01:01:10,534 --> 01:01:13,833
Losing draftees is a bad week.
Losing a colonel is a massacre.

572
01:01:13,905 --> 01:01:15,338
Moore is still fiighting.

573
01:01:15,407 --> 01:01:17,465
He's under strength
against more men than he can count.

574
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:20,202
- He's got a whole platoon lost.
- They're not lost.

575
01:01:20,275 --> 01:01:22,405
They're only cut off
and surrounded.

576
01:01:25,717 --> 01:01:27,306
Then they're lost.

577
01:01:27,382 --> 01:01:29,818
- Sergeant Major!
- Sir!

578
01:01:31,755 --> 01:01:35,246
We need to carve out
an emergency LZ right over there.

579
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:37,313
- Sir!
- Blow the trees down!

580
01:01:46,838 --> 01:01:48,804
Fire in the hole!

581
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:56,802
Colonel, this is Snakeshit
and Too Tall.

582
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,746
We're comin' in
with two loads of ammo.

583
01:01:58,813 --> 01:02:00,793
Crandall, we've blown a new LZ.

584
01:02:00,927 --> 01:02:03,362
When you come in,
come in from the east. Out.

585
01:02:07,699 --> 01:02:09,795
Colonel, it's Brigade Headquarters.
They want you out.

586
01:02:09,871 --> 01:02:13,393
- Well, we can't get out, damn it!
- Not all of us.Just you.

587
01:02:13,471 --> 01:02:16,373
Saigon wants to debrief you.

588
01:02:16,442 --> 01:02:18,875
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Say again.

589
01:02:18,945 --> 01:02:21,344
Will you repeat that order?

590
01:02:27,253 --> 01:02:29,481
Too Tall, follow the colonel
to the new LZ.

591
01:02:29,556 --> 01:02:31,489
I see him, Snake.

592
01:02:35,563 --> 01:02:38,054
He's right here!
Let's go! Move!

593
01:02:40,567 --> 01:02:42,228
Let's move! Move!

594
01:02:43,201 --> 01:02:44,998
Oh, shit.

595
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:48,402
- Come on! We'll give you a hand!
- We're moving on board!

596
01:02:48,474 --> 01:02:51,567
All right, get that ammo off
and get the wounded on!

597
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:54,170
Bring 'em on!
Get 'em on, boys!

598
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:02,480
No, we're overloaded!

599
01:03:02,556 --> 01:03:04,317
- Leave him!
- I'll get out! It's Ray!

600
01:03:04,391 --> 01:03:06,913
He's hurt worse than me!

601
01:03:07,929 --> 01:03:10,759
You hang on!
I'll see you back there, Ray!

602
01:03:36,018 --> 01:03:38,353
You, me and Ouellette
are all we have in reserve.

603
01:03:38,422 --> 01:03:40,985
Yeah, but it's
slacking up a little.

604
01:03:41,061 --> 01:03:44,652
No, they're just regrouping
for another assault.

605
01:03:44,728 --> 01:03:46,822
Distribute that ammo.

606
01:03:46,898 --> 01:03:50,960
Ouellette, tell Crandall he's got
time to get one more flight in here.

607
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:52,000
Yes, sir.

608
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:58,639
Doc, you give this water
to the wounded.

609
01:04:00,777 --> 01:04:03,710
Running out of water.
Must be terrible for 'em.

610
01:04:04,447 --> 01:04:06,880
Those guys are cut off out there.

611
01:04:12,556 --> 01:04:14,681
Running low on ammo, Sarge!

612
01:04:14,759 --> 01:04:17,594
Pick your target.
One shot, one kill.

613
01:04:17,661 --> 01:04:20,356
- Roger that, Sarge.
- How we doin', Doc?

614
01:04:20,431 --> 01:04:22,456
Ernie, we're out of water.

615
01:04:23,938 --> 01:04:25,797
That's the last of it.

616
01:04:40,487 --> 01:04:42,420
My face is on fire! Help!

617
01:04:42,487 --> 01:04:44,956
Foster, hold still!
Hold still!

618
01:04:45,023 --> 01:04:46,817
I'll cut your face!
Hold still!

619
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:03,335
Doc, Doc, it's Foster!

620
01:05:03,411 --> 01:05:04,670
Okay.

621
01:05:06,612 --> 01:05:09,103
Does anybody have
any more bandages?

622
01:05:25,728 --> 01:05:27,721
Ernie, you hit too?
You hit?

623
01:05:27,797 --> 01:05:29,161
No, no, I'm okay.

624
01:05:29,231 --> 01:05:31,498
Our guys are gonna
come for us, aren't they?

625
01:05:34,103 --> 01:05:35,364
Yeah.

626
01:05:35,442 --> 01:05:37,032
When?

627
01:05:39,076 --> 01:05:40,739
Plug his wound.

628
01:05:43,282 --> 01:05:46,219
That's the main LZ,
but it's closed.
