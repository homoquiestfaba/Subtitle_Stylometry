1
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,619
- Give me two more.

2
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,555
- Raise you two.

3
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,190
- Oh, raise me two?

4
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:45,597
Jacks and kings,
what do you got?

5
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,766
Ah, it's all me.

6
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,538
You suck at this game, man.

7
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,173
- I know.

8
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:58,410
- You needed to gamble more
when you were growing up.

9
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,470
- I can't tell you
how excited we are

10
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,372
that you chose our
institution to do research

11
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,141
for your new book, Dr. Marcus.

12
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:31,777
- Well that
pleases me to hear, Dr. Victor.

13
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:33,779
- Please, call me Paul.

14
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:35,514
May I call you Daniel?

15
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:36,848
- Actually, no.

16
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:42,854
I only let my friends
call me Daniel.

17
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:45,023
Paul, have a seat please.

18
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,862
Have you had a chance to...

19
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,565
- oh, finished it last night.

20
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,034
Very, very impressive
work, doctor.

21
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,136
A riveting read.

22
00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:59,605
We're lucky to have you here.

23
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:01,206
- Well thank you, that's
so nice of you to say.

24
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,609
My only hope is that I
can make a difference

25
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:06,178
in the lives of
your patients here.

26
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,780
- I have no doubt that you will.

27
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,249
Though I must say,

28
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:11,984
you certainly have your
hands full with this group.

29
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:14,519
I can assure you of that.

30
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:17,689
Do you mind if I ask why these
patients stood out to you?

31
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,057
- Not at all.

32
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,626
The research I'm
going to be doing here

33
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:22,227
is in support of a
new book of mine,

34
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,929
which is going to be addressing

35
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,865
the fundamental difference
between true mental illness

36
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:30,002
and that of a created
psychosis brought on by

37
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:33,205
a patient's need to
buffer the subconscious

38
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:35,207
against some horrendous
or horrific act

39
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:37,376
that's been occurred
upon them in the past.

40
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:41,613
Or it could be hiding a much
more sinister, darker issue,

41
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,482
which is,

42
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,918
that they're lying.

43
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,821
And they're hiding some heinous,

44
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:53,692
horrible act in their past
that they're guilty of.

45
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:55,160
- Well, in that case,

46
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:56,995
you've picked the
cream of the crop.

47
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,230
These patients suffer from

48
00:04:58,232 --> 00:04:59,931
a variety of mental
health issues,

49
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:03,335
probably the most
severe I've ever seen.

50
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:06,004
Everything from
paranoid schizophrenia,

51
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:09,574
extreme phobias and
delusional disorders.

52
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:13,211
Causing nearly all of them to
commit some terrible crime.

53
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:15,080
- Which is why I chose them.

54
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:16,148
Now, were they
informed that I was

55
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,083
doing research on a new book?

56
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:20,252
- Yeah, they've
certainly been told.

57
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:22,621
Whether they remember or
not remains to be seen.

58
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:24,756
- Well, I believe that...

59
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,958
Being honest with a
patient is a way of

60
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,860
unlocking their trust.

61
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,697
- Of course.

62
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,299
As requested, all the
patients have been

63
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:36,368
moved into a joint holding area.

64
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,171
And I've given specific
instructions to Kyle and Shane...

65
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,673
- Kyle and Shane, they are?

66
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,876
- They're the orderlies I've
assigned to assist you today.

67
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,445
Kyle is my nephew.

68
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,747
Not the brightest young man,

69
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,415
but certainly
capable of escorting

70
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,719
the patients in and
out of the office.

71
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:56,755
Unfortunately, our operational
budget has been cut

72
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,757
by the board of directors.

73
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,325
Again.

74
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:03,895
So we do what we can
with staffing these days.

75
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:07,566
- Well, when this new book
comes out and it's a success,

76
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:10,302
I will attribute your institution
with all the research

77
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:11,503
and hopefully that'll buffer

78
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:14,306
some of your costs
in the future.

79
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,677
- I have faith that it will.

80
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:21,012
And I do hope the
office we've provided

81
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,181
for the interviews will suffice.

82
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:25,016
Due to the severe nature
of mental illnesses

83
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,318
of the patients you've selected,

84
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,720
we have to keep them
under maximum security.

85
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:32,324
- Well, I'm sure
it'll be just fine.

86
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,126
- Well, if there's
anything else you need,

87
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:36,027
just have one of the
orderlies come find me.

88
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,229
I'll be on my afternoon rounds.

89
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,131
- Thank you very much.

90
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,567
- Enjoy the sessions, doctor.

91
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,803
- Absolutely.

92
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,298
- Dude, this place blows,
I don't get any service.

93
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,334
- Dude, what the hell?

94
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:17,702
- Gentlemen.

95
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:22,808
- Yes?

96
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,545
- Could you bring in
patient 110984, please?

97
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:29,848
- Yes sir.

98
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,753
- For the record,
patient 110984.

99
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,689
Jill, 27 years old.

100
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:41,393
She's been institutionalized
for over 17 years.

101
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:42,727
The patient claims
her mother tried

102
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,397
to murder her at the age of 10.

103
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,668
Patient has been
exhibiting behavior

104
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,704
not unlike anorexia or
bulimia for the past 11 days

105
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:56,441
and has refused water
for the past 48 hours.

106
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:24,302
Okay, thank you, that'll be all.

107
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,904
- Dr. Marcus, I don't
think I'm supposed to...

108
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:29,941
- and this is the order I'd
like to see the patients in.

109
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:31,142
Your name is?

110
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,611
- Kyle.

111
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:33,745
- Kyle.

112
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:36,314
Thank you Kyle, we'll be fine.

113
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,730
Hello Jill.

114
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,534
My name's Dr. Marcus.

115
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,769
- What do you want?

116
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,771
- I'd like to help you.

117
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:04,376
- Why are you recording me?

118
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:08,613
- Oh well, that's so that
you can help me help you.

119
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:10,649
- Uncuff me.

120
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,085
- Well, I'm afraid I
don't have the key.

121
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,820
- That's bullshit.

122
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:19,391
- Why do you want to be
out of your restraints?

123
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,592
Hmm?

124
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:22,093
Is it so that you
can pull out your iv,

125
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,762
continue hurting yourself?

126
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:25,997
Is that what you wanna do?

127
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:31,269
- I'd rather be dead
than be here any more.

128
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:33,705
- Really?

129
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:38,543
Hmm.

130
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,918
I have something
I'd like to try.

131
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:52,023
I can make this very
quick, very quick.

132
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:53,558
I can say that

133
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,628
you lunged at me after I let
you out of your restraints.

134
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,697
And I had to defend myself.

135
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,799
And you know what,
here's the best part.

136
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,534
Nobody's going to give a damn.

137
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,636
So you just sit
there nice and calm

138
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:07,439
and it'll be over in a second.

139
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,221
- Are you crazy?

140
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,226
Why would you do that?

141
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:31,763
- Well, I did just prove
that you don't wanna die.

142
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:34,499
- I don't wanna be here anymore!

143
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:36,701
- Well.

144
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,806
Maybe I can help you with that.

145
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,241
Tell me what happened.

146
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:44,509
Tell me what happened
with your mother,

147
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:45,910
with your mommy.

148
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,051
- She was trying to kill me.

149
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,053
- How?

150
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,588
- You already know
what happened,

151
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,556
you have everything right
there in those folders.

152
00:10:58,558 --> 00:10:59,824
- All right.

153
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,359
Look, I could send
you back with a

154
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,261
recommendation for
electro-shock therapy.

155
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:06,197
Young lady if you think
your stay here has been,

156
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,199
trying,

157
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:11,936
believe me, it can get
a hell of a lot worse.

158
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,539
- What do you want from me?

159
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,940
- I want the truth.

160
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,777
Not what's in the
files, I want...

161
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,312
I want what you remember.

162
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:23,481
- Will you help me?

163
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,549
- I can try.

164
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,053
But first you're gonna have to

165
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:29,921
open up, be honest with
me, tell me the truth.

166
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:32,490
And I will know if you're not.

167
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:44,869
This is going nowhere.

168
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,705
- They say I'm crazy!

169
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:50,875
But I'm not.

170
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,048
- All right.

171
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,050
Why?

172
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,456
- I loved my mom.

173
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,126
She was a good mom.

174
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:10,595
Until...

175
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,570
Until she started seeing it.

176
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:23,975
- It?

177
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:28,947
Seeing it?

178
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:40,658
- Honey.

179
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,330
Why are you in the bed?

180
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:47,999
Jill!

181
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,502
Did you wet the bed?

182
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,204
Oh god.

183
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,911
Oh my god!

184
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:02,046
Oh my god, honey, what happened?

185
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,248
What happened Jill?

186
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,349
Was there somebody here?

187
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:05,351
Talk to me!

188
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:07,953
Katie!

189
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,532
Oh my god.

190
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,201
Katie.

191
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,137
Katie.

192
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,139
Katie.

193
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,519
- Mom.

194
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:53,785
- Mom?

195
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:57,322
What are you doing?

196
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:58,324
- Huh?

197
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,460
- What happened to the hallway?

198
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,103
Oh no!

199
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,506
You're doing it again!

200
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,379
- Open up!

201
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:22,613
Open the door!

202
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,686
It's your mother, open the door!

203
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,188
Open the door!

204
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,456
Now!

205
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,424
Put your hand on the
door and unlock it!

206
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:34,926
It's your mother!

207
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,396
Please, let me in!

208
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:07,659
Oh god, oh!

209
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:12,296
Get outta there,
you're in danger!

210
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,771
My baby.

211
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:20,773
Oh my baby.

212
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:36,687
- Why did you kill
somebody you claim to love?

213
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,256
- I had no choice.

214
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,893
- Did you hate your mother?

215
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,462
- That's a messed up question.

216
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,671
- Which only you know
the answer to, hmm?

217
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,575
- I wanna go back to my cell.

218
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,178
- Where was your
father during all this?

219
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,180
Hmm?

220
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,951
- He wasn't there, he was...

221
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,722
He was out with my sister Katie.

222
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:12,724
- Ah.

223
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:18,162
Did you ever wonder who
the real monster here is?

224
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,068
You want everyone to
think of you as this poor,

225
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,804
helpless victim,
who had no choice.

226
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:27,872
- Screw you!

227
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,341
- When in fact,

228
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,711
you're actually a cold-blooded

229
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:35,947
sociopathic

230
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,950
killer.

231
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,319
With an Electra complex
who wanted mommy

232
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:44,655
out of the way so she could
have daddy all to herself.

233
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:45,957
Isn't that right?

234
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,425
- No!

235
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:49,093
- Were you eventually going
to kill your sister too?

236
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:49,927
- No!
- - Were you?

237
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,929
- You know nothing!

238
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:54,366
Help!

239
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:58,970
- Hey hey hey.

240
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,038
Okay, breathe.

241
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,640
Breathe, calm down.

242
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,010
Shane, I need backup, now.

243
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,779
- I hate you!

244
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:09,847
You're evil!

245
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,190
Get me outta here!

246
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,893
Who are you?

247
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:23,728
Who the hell are you?

248
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,065
- Gentlemen, when
you get a chance,

249
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,066
bring in patient

250
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:29,934
10

251
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:30,935
25

252
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:31,937
78.

253
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,452
John Doe, estimated
to be in his late 50s,

254
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:49,754
was found wandering in the woods

255
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:51,689
wearing nothing more
than a bathrobe.

256
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:55,226
John Doe, or JD as
they call him here,

257
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:59,697
claims to have no
recollection of who he is.

258
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,800
- At least this one won't
give us any problems, huh?

259
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:05,870
- Yeah, he's the
shy, quiet type.

260
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:08,206
Isn't that right, JD?

261
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,674
- He has no known family

262
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,275
and authorities were
unable to establish

263
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:14,078
his identity through
fingerprints or dental records.

264
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,881
He was admitted to this facility

265
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,416
five years ago.

266
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:19,884
After several violent encounters

267
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:24,121
due to a recurring nightmare
and an unexplainable fear of...

268
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,123
Plastic wrap.

269
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:28,826
Hmm.

270
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,842
This patient's loaded.

271
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,980
JD here stays baked 24/7.

272
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,720
- Wonderful, okay,
get him outta here.

273
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:59,156
Bring him back when
he's more coherent, hmm?

274
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:00,992
- We can't do that, sir.

275
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:02,927
That's Dr. Victor's orders.

276
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,128
- This patient is violent.

277
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,430
- I'm right here, you know?

278
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,366
- All right.

279
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,038
What's your name?

280
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,406
- JD.

281
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:17,742
- JD, do you know which,

282
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,577
which city you're in?

283
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,246
- They won't tell me.

284
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:26,851
That was wonderful.

285
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:28,119
All right, all right,
go on, get outta here.

286
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:28,953
Leave him here.

287
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,121
Go on, go on.

288
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,259
Get the door on the way out.

289
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:42,433
All right JD, I am...

290
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,135
Dr. Marcus.

291
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,170
- What are you doing?

292
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:47,271
- I'm recording you.

293
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:49,440
You have a problem with that?

294
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:51,409
- Like I have a choice?

295
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,888
Can you, can you put
that away please?

296
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:04,890
Please?

297
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,525
- Is there a problem?

298
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,944
Oh my god, the
charts are right on.

299
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:30,348
You do have a problem
with plastic wrap.

300
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,885
- Can you put that away,

301
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:35,887
please?

302
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,357
- Mmm.

303
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:44,962
Here.

304
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,903
All right, all right,
look look look.

305
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,271
I'm wrapping it up.

306
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:55,673
Putting it away.

307
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:00,444
- Thank you.

308
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:01,446
Thank you.

309
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,015
- All right JD, you are,

310
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,017
in spring valley
mental institution.

311
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:10,688
Do you remember
being brought here?

312
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,257
- I only remember one thing.

313
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:14,225
- Ah good, what?

314
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:15,826
- Why should I tell you?

315
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:16,828
- Hmm.

316
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:20,164
Well, if I'm gonna help you,

317
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,600
I have to know what
makes you tick.

318
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:26,670
- No no.
- - Yes.

319
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:29,708
No, no!

320
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,519
Please!

321
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:43,621
No no no no no!

322
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:48,225
Get it off me, get
it off me, please!

323
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:51,228
Take it off, take
it off, take it off!

324
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,331
- Not until you tell me
what it is I want to know.

325
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,299
- Help!

326
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:58,436
Help me, somebody, please help!

327
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:01,439
Help, someone please help me!

328
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:03,073
Help me!

329
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:04,075
- Out!

330
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:05,943
Right now.

331
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,182
- Please, take it off!

332
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,228
- Are you gonna
play ball with me?

333
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,797
You gonna give me what I need?

334
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,041
Now.

335
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:39,343
JD.

336
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,647
So you don't
remember who you are,

337
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,349
where you come from?

338
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:47,985
Why don't we start with this...

339
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,756
Little problem you have
with plastic wrap, hmm?

340
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:57,995
- I was on vacation.

341
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:58,997
In the UK.

342
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,433
And he killed me.

343
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:04,468
- He what?

344
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,371
- He killed me!

345
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:10,908
- Who?

346
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,144
- I don't know who he was.

347
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:15,646
Or why he did it.

348
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,083
But.

349
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:20,251
In the dream,

350
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:22,753
I could see

351
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:25,489
and feel

352
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:27,858
and hear

353
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,361
everything!

354
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:08,886
- Trick or treat!

355
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:12,556
- Fuck off.

356
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,060
- Excuse me!

357
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:19,863
Oi, that's no bloody
way to talk to children!

358
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,867
- Audi's in the garage.

359
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:30,708
Now fuck off!

360
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,263
- Evening, ladies.

361
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:54,832
- How's it going?

362
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:57,234
- Werewolf is mine, marry me!

363
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,736
- Marry me!

364
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:14,985
Oh shit mate, look at this!

365
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:17,554
- Mate, what are you draggin'?

366
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,047
- Hey!

367
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:45,582
Excuse me, aren't you?

368
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:49,253
Sorry, didn't you go
to Truman prep school?

369
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:51,221
- No.

370
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:52,990
- You did, didn't you?

371
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:54,158
You did.

372
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
1997.

373
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,060
I'm Alan.

374
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:58,228
Alan Fletcher?

375
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:01,231
I was a prefect
while you were there.

376
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,971
I haven't seen you since then.

377
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,339
You never really did fit in.

378
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,241
How are you anyway?

379
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:14,545
That's a brilliant
costume, by the way.

380
00:30:14,547 --> 00:30:16,947
That's just genius.

381
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,115
Terry?

382
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:20,984
Come look at this,
look at all that blood!

383
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:24,121
- Ah, that is an
amazing costume, mate!

384
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:26,256
You're meant to be a
killer or something, right?

385
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:28,125
- I am a killer, yes.

386
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:29,893
- And that's the
body in the bag, is it?

387
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:31,428
Latest victim type of thing?

388
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,096
- Brand new.
- - Hah, brilliant!

389
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:34,231
Fucking brilliant!

390
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:41,905
Mate.

391
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:43,373
It's bloody heavy.

392
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,943
Can we give you a hand or two?

393
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:49,379
Christ!

394
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,982
You take your Halloween
shit seriously, don't you?

395
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:54,384
You got an actual body
in there or something?

396
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:56,019
Help him, dickhead.

397
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,256
It's so heavy.

398
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:03,594
Anyway, what's on
the agenda tonight?

399
00:31:03,596 --> 00:31:05,062
Have you been to a party?

400
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:06,530
- No.

401
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:08,465
- Listen, we're heading to
this pretty sweet loft party,

402
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:09,700
just down the road here.

403
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:11,168
I mean, our costumes
are a bit last minute,

404
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:14,238
but yours, we would really make
an entrance with this thing.

405
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,106
I know it's late, but you
will pop in for just one,

406
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:17,374
won't you?

407
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,209
Our pal Jack, I mean,
he's got to see this.

408
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:23,013
He's so into his horror
shit, he's gonna love it!

409
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:24,982
- I'd rather not
get sidetracked.

410
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:25,916
- Mate, mate,

411
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:27,451
don't be so bloody boring.

412
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:29,353
Please, just one drink.

413
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:30,787
It'll be really, really quick,

414
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:32,709
you'll be back on the
streets killing in no time.

415
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,561
- I shan't stay long.

416
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:38,862
- Yes!

417
00:31:38,864 --> 00:31:40,764
This way then, killer!

418
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,301
- You know Terry, I
think that's racist.

419
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:45,535
- How's that racist?

420
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:47,104
- It's just my mom's
cleaner's black,

421
00:31:47,106 --> 00:31:48,839
so I know about this stuff.

422
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:51,842
- Yeah, well your mom's racist.

423
00:31:51,844 --> 00:31:53,810
- She is a bit racist.

424
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:20,971
Wait wait, stay there,
I'm gonna go find Jack,

425
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:22,873
don't move, all right?

426
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,813
Yes!

427
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:36,920
Listen, listen, you have
to come and see this.

428
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:37,988
His costume.

429
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,157
Look at it!

430
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:46,763
- Now that is a
fuckin' costume, mate!

431
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:48,231
- Nice face paint.

432
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:49,132
Let me guess,

433
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,534
American psycho?

434
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:54,571
Hey Babs, pour us a round
of the reagent, man!

435
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:58,742
I wanna do a shot with the
best costume in the house!

436
00:32:58,744 --> 00:32:59,744
Fuck me!

437
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,846
Are you responsible for this?

438
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:04,448
- Of course.

439
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,316
- The detail, man!

440
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,986
I can just about make out
that nasty wound, and...

441
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:11,321
Oh, the blood is perfect!

442
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:15,225
You've got some serious
talent right here!

443
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:16,227
Ah-hah!

444
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:18,562
Guys,

445
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:19,564
grab one.

446
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:21,398
A toast.

447
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,268
To our new-found friend.

448
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,405
Finally, someone who
appreciates Halloween

449
00:33:28,407 --> 00:33:29,806
as much as I do!

450
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:36,580
Let's raise hell!

451
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,565
- TNT, please.

452
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:56,633
- Coming up.

453
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,549
- Now that

454
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:16,253
is a brilliant costume
you came up with.

455
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:18,088
Wine please.

456
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,090
- Hmm?

457
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,858
Oh.

458
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,061
Well it's not really a costume.

459
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:25,429
- Right.

460
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:26,830
You're right, sorry.

461
00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:29,733
More of a prop, isn't it?

462
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,635
And the suit is great.

463
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:35,539
Sort of a mental James
bond sort of thing.

464
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:36,541
I'm Maggie.

465
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,875
- Hello Maggie.

466
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:44,347
It is just brilliant.

467
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:45,549
I mean,

468
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:49,086
how long did it take
you to stuff that thing?

469
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:50,821
- Well it's more
of a roll, really.

470
00:34:50,823 --> 00:34:52,889
Like a pig in a blanket.

471
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:56,159
- Well it is just brilliant.

472
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:58,628
Just never seen
anything like it before.

473
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,931
Not that well done, anyway.

474
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,867
- I'm sure there
are plenty of us.

475
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:05,469
Best night of the year for it.

476
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:06,803
It's much harder to
go walking around

477
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:08,472
with a dead body on
a regular evening

478
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:10,607
than it is on Halloween.

479
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,379
But we manage nonetheless.

480
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:20,450
Just have to know
what you're doing.

481
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,518
- Of course.

482
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,489
Cheers!

483
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:26,491
- Cheers.

484
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:29,559
- All right all you ghouls

485
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:30,994
and all you monsters out there,

486
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:32,329
hope you're enjoying
yourselves so far tonight.

487
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:34,264
Spooky, spooky night.

488
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:35,499
Look guys, I'm really sorry,

489
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:37,367
but we've just got
10 minutes left

490
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:39,202
behind the bar tonight,
just ten minutes left.

491
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:43,540
- Well I must be going now.

492
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:45,008
- What, no!

493
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,443
You can't go, it's Halloween!

494
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:47,944
Jack will be having
an after party.

495
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:49,146
Jack!

496
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:50,914
You're having an
after party, right?

497
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:51,916
- Mmm.

498
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:55,418
Yeah, yeah sure!

499
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,988
A few of you can come back
to mine for a night cap.

500
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:58,922
- Brilliant.

501
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:00,590
- No, really, I must be going.

502
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:01,825
- Why?

503
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,426
You haven't got work in
the morning, have you?

504
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:04,794
- I've got work right now,

505
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:06,963
I need to bury that
thing before 3 am

506
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:08,632
or I don't get the bounty!

507
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:09,633
- The bounty!

508
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:10,867
Oooh, a prize!

509
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:14,104
Like a Halloween scavenger hunt?

510
00:36:14,106 --> 00:36:15,772
That's what you meant
earlier when you said

511
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:17,007
there's plenty of us doing it!

512
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:19,176
OMG, I'm so thick!

513
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:20,810
Well we can help you.

514
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:23,380
It sounds like so much fun!

515
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:24,214
- I don't...

516
00:36:24,216 --> 00:36:25,048
- come on guys!

517
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:25,882
We've gotta do this!

518
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:27,117
- Mate!

519
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,084
Of course we'll help
you bury the body!

520
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:29,853
And get the fuckin' prize!

521
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:32,088
The least we can do, mate.

522
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,357
- To the woods!

523
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:48,138
Right in here.

524
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,479
Start her up, my friend!

525
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:57,481
Come on!

526
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,202
- This will do.

527
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:22,472
Stay here.

528
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:34,584
- Where are we?

529
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:37,120
We were driving
for over an hour.

530
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,957
- Perfect!

531
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,838
- Right gents.

532
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,806
Follow the trail and
you'll spot a bonfire,

533
00:37:56,808 --> 00:38:00,777
get it lit, drop him in
the hole and cover him.

534
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,149
I'll come and join you
shortly to finish things up.

535
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:18,962
- Ah, dick!

536
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,731
Dick!

537
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,104
- All good?

538
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:29,706
- Yeah.

539
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:30,940
Yeah.

540
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:34,744
Feel the weight on
this little bugger.

541
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:36,346
- Wow.

542
00:38:36,348 --> 00:38:39,649
Yeah, that's really
got some clout to it.

543
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,784
There you go.

544
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:18,321
- What the fuck?

545
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:20,156
What the actual fuck?

546
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,104
- Alan.

547
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:36,506
- Keep back.

548
00:39:36,508 --> 00:39:37,807
Keep back!

549
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:38,708
- Alan!

550
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,978
- Fuck!

551
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:51,121
No, please!

552
00:39:51,123 --> 00:39:52,123
Please, no!

553
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,725
Please!

554
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,036
- All done here.

555
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:09,305
So.

556
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:10,306
Maggie.

557
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:12,876
What do you fancy doing?

558
00:40:12,878 --> 00:40:15,011
- Did you get your prize?

559
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,480
- So to speak.

560
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,718
Do you fancy coming
back to mine for a bit?

561
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,154
- Only if you're sure.

562
00:40:24,156 --> 00:40:27,223
I wouldn't wanna keep
you up any longer.

563
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:30,894
- I'm sure I've got
one more in me tonight.

564
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:39,969
Is there a problem, officer?

565
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,337
- Trouble with the Van?

566
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:43,540
- No, we're fine.

567
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:45,542
We literally just
headed out here to

568
00:40:45,544 --> 00:40:48,011
get away from the city
lights for a while.

569
00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:49,279
We're just heading home now,

570
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:51,281
had a bit of a mad one.

571
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:54,217
- I see.

572
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,485
Yeah, well make sure you do.

573
00:40:55,487 --> 00:40:57,153
We've got lots of nasty
reports this evening,

574
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:58,855
don't want any more.

575
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:00,156
You two be on your way.

576
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:02,559
And you, make sure she
gets home all right.

577
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:04,594
- Absolutely, officer.

578
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:05,829
Take care now!

579
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,730
Prick.

580
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:25,515
- Did they fall for it?

581
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:26,483
- Yeah mate,

582
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:28,485
fuckin' hook, line and sinker!

583
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:30,286
Some bloke knobbing his bird.

584
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:32,222
Fair play to him actually,
she was quite fit, you know?

585
00:41:32,224 --> 00:41:34,457
- Oh man!

586
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:36,192
This is so much
better than last year

587
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:37,760
when we dressed up as priests!

588
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:39,596
- I fucking love Halloween!

589
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,371
- So let me get this straight.

590
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:52,075
You have this
recurring nightmare...

591
00:41:52,077 --> 00:41:53,977
Where you're murdered,

592
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,779
wrapped in this plastic,

593
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:59,782
carted all over town
and yet you could see,

594
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:02,852
feel and hear absolutely
everything that was going on?

595
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,487
- Yes.

596
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:07,290
- That's absolutely amazing.

597
00:42:07,292 --> 00:42:09,292
You know what I think?

598
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:11,661
I think you're a lying,

599
00:42:11,663 --> 00:42:14,297
manipulative miscreant.

600
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:16,132
Who's given up on life
and decided to live

601
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:18,268
in this institution where
you can get three squares

602
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,570
and a free bed every night.

603
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:25,141
You are a pathetic
waste of human life,

604
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:26,876
and I'm going to make
sure that you live

605
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,612
in this self-made
nightmare of yours

606
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:31,848
for the rest of your life.

607
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,183
- No, no, no!

608
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,524
- Don't touch that.

609
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:45,728
I want the patient to
remain wrapped in plastic.

610
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,463
Doctor's orders.

611
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,310
Now get him out of here.

612
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:06,115
Bring in patient 100174.

613
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:17,193
Born in Reykjavík, Iceland.

614
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:20,730
Gabrielle fled to the
United States in the hope of

615
00:43:20,732 --> 00:43:22,999
avoiding prosecution for
the murder of a woman

616
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:27,704
she believed her American fiance
was having an affair with.

617
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:30,406
Upon her capture,

618
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:32,308
her fiance's attorney
struck a plea deal

619
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,644
with Icelandic authorities
to keep her stateside,

620
00:43:34,646 --> 00:43:35,878
with the condition that she stay

621
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,616
in a maximum security
psychiatric institution

622
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:42,885
for the remainder of her life.

623
00:43:42,887 --> 00:43:46,522
She's been in this facility
for over 10 years now.

624
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:48,992
Gabrielle continues
to deny the charges,

625
00:43:48,994 --> 00:43:52,962
claiming they were
attacked by zombies.

626
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,832
After a detailed
observation by Dr. Victor,

627
00:43:55,834 --> 00:43:58,601
it has been concluded
that she suffers from

628
00:43:58,603 --> 00:44:00,737
severe bipolar
disorder, depression,

629
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:04,874
and is prone to extreme, and
often violent, outbursts.

630
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:09,112
She claims to suffer from
a recurring dream of a...

631
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:13,983
So-called zombie attack.

632
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:15,018
- Come on, get her up.

633
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,085
We gotta go.

634
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:34,470
- Ah.

635
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:35,571
Gabrielle.

636
00:44:35,573 --> 00:44:37,607
Please, have a seat.

637
00:44:37,609 --> 00:44:39,509
- I think you're wasting
your time, Dr. Marcus.

638
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:42,912
She hasn't spoken a word
of English in years.

639
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:50,353
Really?

640
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:52,435
Why do you believe this is
such a waste of your time?

641
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:00,229
Hmm?

642
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,236
Well first, I'd like
you to just have a seat,

643
00:45:07,238 --> 00:45:09,572
so why don't you just

644
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:10,574
sit down?

645
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:22,185
Gentlemen, I won't
need you any further.

646
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:24,087
I'll call you if I do.

647
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:36,466
Yes, I wrote those.

648
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,068
Are you impressed?

649
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:43,673
I wanna help you.

650
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:49,612
And I know you understand
what I'm saying, Gabrielle.

651
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:57,854
True.

652
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:00,289
I'm writing a book.

653
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:02,725
Along the way, I might
be able to help you.

654
00:46:02,727 --> 00:46:05,061
I really do wanna help you.

655
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:13,136
Nobody believes you.

656
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:15,037
Hmm?

657
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:30,052
Maybe if you told me

658
00:46:30,054 --> 00:46:31,788
what happened,

659
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:35,057
I could help you find
peace in all this?

660
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:36,059
Hmm?

661
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:42,098
I'm going to turn
on the camera now.

662
00:46:43,568 --> 00:46:44,568
Okay?

663
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:25,581
- It's okay.

664
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:28,851
It really is.

665
00:56:28,853 --> 00:56:32,588
I understand, I know
what you are Gabrielle.

666
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,193
You

667
00:56:38,195 --> 00:56:39,628
are a

668
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,930
sick, evil, jealous person,

669
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,434
who brutally murdered a young
lady because you thought

670
00:56:45,436 --> 00:56:48,103
she was having an
affair with your fiance.

671
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:49,338
And on top of all that,

672
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,106
you want everyone to
believe that a zombie

673
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:53,242
bit her face off.

674
00:56:53,244 --> 00:56:54,877
- Go to hell!

675
00:56:54,879 --> 00:56:56,812
- Oh, look at that.

676
00:56:56,814 --> 00:56:59,581
The murderer speaks English.

677
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:00,583
- You liar!

678
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:03,519
You said you would help me!

679
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:04,887
I'll kill you!

680
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,259
- Got her.

681
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:19,968
- Next.

682
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,372
Originally from New Zealand,

683
00:57:23,374 --> 00:57:27,443
Sarah has been institutionalized
since she was 15 years old.

684
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:29,812
Her parents moved her stateside

685
00:57:29,814 --> 00:57:31,680
when she was 12 in
hopes of getting her

686
00:57:31,682 --> 00:57:34,750
the best mental
healthcare possible.

687
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:37,419
After attempting suicide,

688
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:39,855
her parents thought it best
that she be admitted here.

689
00:57:39,857 --> 00:57:43,859
She often wakes up screaming
in the middle of the night and

690
00:57:43,861 --> 00:57:46,261
keeps asking for her shovel.

691
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:50,799
- The sedatives are kicking in.

692
00:57:55,573 --> 00:57:56,839
Dude.

693
00:57:56,841 --> 00:57:58,440
I'm sick of this job,
she tried to bite me!

694
00:57:58,442 --> 00:58:00,509
- Stop being such a pussy, okay?

695
00:58:00,511 --> 00:58:03,879
- Are you boys ready
for me yet, or what?

696
00:58:03,881 --> 00:58:05,848
Fuck it, let's do this.

697
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:08,784
- Come on.

698
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:26,134
- Where the fuck is
my bloody shovel?

699
00:58:26,136 --> 00:58:27,336
- Hey!

700
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:28,804
Watch your mouth!

701
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:31,373
- No no, that's fine.

702
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:34,176
Leave us.

703
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:37,079
It's all right, I'll be okay.

704
00:58:37,081 --> 00:58:39,381
I'll be fine, I'll be fine.

705
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:52,227
Sarah, I am Dr. Marcus.

706
00:58:52,229 --> 00:58:54,763
- Hmm, I gathered that.

707
00:58:54,765 --> 00:58:56,465
- I'd like to ask
you a few questions.

708
00:58:56,467 --> 00:58:58,433
- About the murder?

709
00:58:58,435 --> 00:59:00,435
- To start with, yes.

710
00:59:00,437 --> 00:59:01,904
- Ludicrous, you know.

711
00:59:01,906 --> 00:59:04,540
I was put away for the
murder of my best friend.

712
00:59:04,542 --> 00:59:06,642
- You deny doing that?

713
00:59:06,644 --> 00:59:11,179
- My friend was unhappy,
she committed suicide.

714
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:13,916
- Yeah, but you buried the body.

715
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:17,319
- Before she did it she asked me

716
00:59:17,321 --> 00:59:19,354
to hide her away afterwards.

717
00:59:19,356 --> 00:59:21,023
It's that simple.

718
00:59:21,025 --> 00:59:23,692
I was just trying
to be a good friend.

719
00:59:23,694 --> 00:59:25,460
That's what I told my parents.

720
00:59:25,462 --> 00:59:27,596
They decided to
move us stateside,

721
00:59:27,598 --> 00:59:29,698
hoping that I could
get some help.

722
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,366
But I don't need any help.

723
00:59:31,368 --> 00:59:33,302
I didn't do anything.

724
00:59:33,304 --> 00:59:35,270
But I bet it'd make
a juicy chapter

725
00:59:35,272 --> 00:59:37,873
for that book you're
going to write, huh?

726
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:40,842
- Does it bother you
that I'm writing a book?

727
00:59:40,844 --> 00:59:43,278
- Your fame is mine,
isn't that right, doc?

728
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,746
- Sarah, I'm here to help you.

729
00:59:47,017 --> 00:59:49,585
Why don't you tell me what

730
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:51,153
really happened?

731
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:56,625
- It was just another day.

732
00:59:56,627 --> 00:59:58,927
Well...

733
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:01,363
I guess it wasn't
exactly the average day

734
01:00:01,365 --> 01:00:05,601
in the life of a 12 year old.

735
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:10,539
- Well what do we say?

736
01:00:10,541 --> 01:00:12,774
- Let's just tell
her it's going to be okay.

737
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:14,109
- We don't know that!

738
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:15,277
- I don't know, I've never had

739
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:16,612
to deal with a
situation like this.

740
01:00:16,614 --> 01:00:20,082
- Well neither have I!
- - Good!

741
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:25,087
- What are you doing, honey?

742
01:00:25,089 --> 01:00:26,755
- Making a card for Vic.

743
01:00:26,757 --> 01:00:28,290
- Oh, that's,

744
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:29,791
that's wonderful!

745
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:34,863
- Do you think she'll sleep
with the angels like Nana?

746
01:00:34,865 --> 01:00:36,398
- What, no.

747
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,967
- Absolutely not, honey.

748
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:41,603
- Poor Vic.

749
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,628
I found one, and
it's really nice.

750
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:08,363
But it's 37 dollars.

751
01:01:12,903 --> 01:01:13,903
Okay.

752
01:01:23,547 --> 01:01:26,415
- Oh honey, what's wrong?

753
01:01:26,417 --> 01:01:28,817
Oh, you dropped your ice cream.

754
01:01:28,819 --> 01:01:30,485
Here you go, here's two dollars.

755
01:01:30,487 --> 01:01:31,920
Go and get yourself another one.

756
01:01:31,922 --> 01:01:35,691
- It was three dollars.

757
01:01:35,693 --> 01:01:37,192
- Christ!

758
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:39,594
Here you go, here's five.

759
01:01:39,596 --> 01:01:41,329
Give me back my two.

760
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:59,381
- I only made 12 dollars today.

761
01:01:59,383 --> 01:02:00,549
- Fuck!

762
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:01,550
- I'm sorry!

763
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:03,051
- It's okay honey.

764
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:04,053
Laser fuck!

765
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:07,489
- That'll be two dollars, daddy.

766
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:25,307
- Shit!

767
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:27,109
Shit!

768
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,579
Shit shit shit shit shit!

769
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:34,683
Oh shit.

770
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:38,954
- Yeah I heard
that when I was 24.

771
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:41,523
Christ, shit, bitch,

772
01:02:41,525 --> 01:02:42,691
fuck, ass,

773
01:02:42,693 --> 01:02:45,227
fuck, cunt, fuck, cunt!

774
01:02:45,229 --> 01:02:46,695
- Nine.
- - Fuck!

775
01:02:46,697 --> 01:02:48,330
- 10!

776
01:02:48,332 --> 01:02:50,766
I still need five more dollars.

777
01:02:53,604 --> 01:02:55,837
- The police still
can't tell me anything.

778
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:57,339
What do you think?

779
01:02:57,341 --> 01:02:59,307
- Well, I think
it'll be fine, just fine.

780
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:01,777
- You can't give up hope Jenny.

781
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:03,245
- How's Sarah coping?

782
01:03:03,247 --> 01:03:05,080
- Well, her best
friend is missing, so...

783
01:03:05,082 --> 01:03:07,649
- Clive!
- - Well, she is.

784
01:03:07,651 --> 01:03:09,785
I'm sorry Jenny!

785
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:12,187
- Come here, Jenny.

786
01:03:12,189 --> 01:03:13,388
Look what you've done.

787
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:14,823
- It wasn't me!

788
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:16,224
- Shh shh.

789
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:30,238
- I got it!

790
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:33,175
Did you hear that?

791
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:37,145
Vic?

792
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:38,947
You must be so tired.

793
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:42,784
Now you can finally sleep.

794
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:26,595
- Why'd you do it?

795
01:04:26,597 --> 01:04:29,664
I mean, if you were trying
to help your friend,

796
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:30,666
then why...

797
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:33,902
Why try and kill yourself?

798
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:35,837
Guilt?

799
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:39,708
Fear of spending the
rest of your life in an

800
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:41,810
institution like this?

801
01:04:41,812 --> 01:04:43,712
- You're the doctor.

802
01:04:43,714 --> 01:04:44,779
You tell me.

803
01:04:48,852 --> 01:04:50,318
- Everyone else
around here might be

804
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:53,688
buying your smug
little act but I'm not.

805
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,657
- Get bent, you twat!

806
01:04:55,659 --> 01:04:57,392
- Now we're really
getting somewhere.

807
01:04:57,394 --> 01:04:58,793
- No, we're not.

808
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:02,797
- Gentlemen, please.

809
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:07,702
I'm going to send you
back to the holding tank.

810
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:11,673
You keep living your
sorry little existence,

811
01:05:11,675 --> 01:05:12,675
but me,

812
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:16,244
I'm still gonna have a good day.

813
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:18,546
- Ah.

814
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:21,917
- Get her outta here.

815
01:05:23,352 --> 01:05:24,853
- Where's my bloody shovel?

816
01:05:24,855 --> 01:05:27,322
I wanna shove it up his arse!

817
01:05:27,324 --> 01:05:29,057
Get the fuck off me!

818
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:36,698
Doctor's gonna be sorry
when I find my shovel.

819
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,868
- It's time to see
the doctor, Jessa.

820
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:45,707
- Jessa hasn't
spoken a word since

821
01:05:45,709 --> 01:05:47,509
she was committed
to this institution

822
01:05:47,511 --> 01:05:48,977
over seven years ago,

823
01:05:48,979 --> 01:05:51,479
when she was found guilty
of killing her mother

824
01:05:51,481 --> 01:05:52,981
and her sister.

825
01:05:52,983 --> 01:05:56,384
She claims an evil
spirit possessed her.

826
01:05:57,753 --> 01:06:00,488
After repeatedly telling the
story to multiple doctors,

827
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:03,191
she simply stopped speaking.

828
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:13,868
- I don't know why
you picked her, sir.

829
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:16,004
The girl's a mute or something.

830
01:06:16,006 --> 01:06:17,872
- Yeah but she kind of

831
01:06:17,874 --> 01:06:20,208
talks with her hands.

832
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:22,744
- Which is why I need her
out of those restraints.

833
01:06:22,746 --> 01:06:23,746
Come on.

834
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:30,418
- Well if she does one
knock, that means yes,

835
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:31,686
or she likes it.

836
01:06:31,688 --> 01:06:34,990
And two knocks means
no, or she hates it.

837
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:38,393
That's pretty much
all we've been able

838
01:06:38,395 --> 01:06:40,362
to get from her so far.

839
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:48,169
- Thank you Kyle,
that's very informative.

840
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:01,249
Jessa.

841
01:07:01,251 --> 01:07:03,251
Do you know who I am?

842
01:07:04,087 --> 01:07:05,754
Good, good, good.

843
01:07:05,756 --> 01:07:06,821
I'm here to help you.

844
01:07:06,823 --> 01:07:09,357
Now, I'd like to try a little

845
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:10,492
hypnotherapy.

846
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:12,994
See if I can't

847
01:07:12,996 --> 01:07:17,265
relax you, get that inner
voice of yours to come out.

848
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:19,834
Have you ever been
hypnotized before?

849
01:07:21,772 --> 01:07:23,605
Do you mind if I try?

850
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:30,745
Jessa, I need an answer.

851
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:35,050
Look, I know you're frightened,

852
01:07:35,052 --> 01:07:37,085
that you've got
things that haunt you.

853
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:39,654
But I'm not frightened,
I can help you with that.

854
01:07:39,656 --> 01:07:41,656
But you have to let me.

855
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:43,892
Please?

856
01:07:54,137 --> 01:07:56,871
Thank you for trusting me.

857
01:07:56,873 --> 01:07:57,873
All right.

858
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,979
I would like you to

859
01:08:04,981 --> 01:08:07,782
just concentrate
on this crystal.

860
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:12,020
Come on now, breathe.

861
01:08:12,022 --> 01:08:13,688
Take a deep breath.

862
01:08:16,358 --> 01:08:17,358
Go inside.

863
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:21,529
That's it, go inside.

864
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:26,134
Free up that voice
that's talking to you.

865
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,003
Let it come out.

866
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:33,675
Tell me what happened.

867
01:09:34,136 --> 01:09:35,670
- Takes a real sick person

868
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:38,640
to do something
like that to a dog.

869
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:41,409
Sorry girls.

870
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:44,779
Norman's in doggy heaven now.

871
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,156
- Was it you?

872
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:03,331
- She made me do it.

873
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:04,632
- The bad lady?

874
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:06,935
Jessa, there's no such thing...

875
01:10:06,937 --> 01:10:09,170
- she's getting worse.

876
01:10:09,172 --> 01:10:10,172
Wait.

877
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,479
Don't you believe me?

878
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:07,695
- Jessa...

879
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:39,160
- I'll be home by
11 at the latest.

880
01:11:39,162 --> 01:11:41,229
And eat before it gets cold.

881
01:11:41,231 --> 01:11:43,364
Jessa sweetie, you listen
to your sister, okay?

882
01:11:43,366 --> 01:11:45,266
And go to bed on time.

883
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:51,105
Come lock up behind me.

884
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:59,080
If she seems sad, there's
ice cream in the fridge.

885
01:11:59,082 --> 01:12:00,181
My girl.

886
01:12:00,183 --> 01:12:02,083
Always has it together.

887
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:04,686
Oh!

888
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:06,421
Thanks.

889
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:27,942
- She won't leave me alone.

890
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,688
What are you gonna do to Sally?

891
01:12:42,157 --> 01:12:43,157
Ow!

892
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,094
- Sally is you.

893
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:49,864
And this is the bad lady.

894
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:51,933
- Doesn't look like her.

895
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:55,136
- See.

896
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:58,139
I think the bad lady,

897
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:01,442
she tied herself to you.

898
01:13:01,444 --> 01:13:04,412
And all we have to
do is untie her.

899
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:06,781
Like a shoelace.

900
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:11,352
- But what if she
doesn't wanna let go?

901
01:13:14,224 --> 01:13:15,690
- We'll make her.

902
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:48,156
- That's what she looks like.

903
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:54,629
- Bowl of reflection,

904
01:13:54,631 --> 01:13:57,198
stones of protection,

905
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,666
may the reason of our harm

906
01:13:58,668 --> 01:14:01,469
feel the power of this charm.

907
01:14:01,471 --> 01:14:03,104
Powers of the witches rise,

908
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:06,007
course unseen across the skies,

909
01:14:06,009 --> 01:14:07,241
hear me beckon,

910
01:14:07,243 --> 01:14:08,376
hear my plea.

911
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:12,013
Spirits bared, I summon thee.

912
01:14:16,853 --> 01:14:18,586
Pass me that candle.

913
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:30,531
- Kara?

914
01:14:30,533 --> 01:14:32,099
- Close your eyes.

915
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:35,269
Demon who dwells in
slivers of night,

916
01:14:35,271 --> 01:14:38,239
uncloak your
shadows to my sight.

917
01:14:38,241 --> 01:14:40,174
Guardians of the ancient towers,

918
01:14:40,176 --> 01:14:42,243
Grant me now thy sacred powers.

919
01:14:42,245 --> 01:14:44,645
Let this child be set free.

920
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:47,014
Such is my will, I banish thee.

921
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:53,454
Let this child be set free!

922
01:14:53,456 --> 01:14:56,023
With all my might,
I banish thee!

923
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:00,795
- Keep going!

924
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:03,631
- I banish thee!

925
01:15:03,633 --> 01:15:04,866
I banish thee!

926
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:30,925
No!

927
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:34,028
Don't touch my sister!

928
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:09,997
- She's gone!

929
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,480
- Hey.

930
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:32,587
Are you all right?

931
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:34,322
- Yeah.

932
01:16:34,324 --> 01:16:35,990
Just glad you're home.

933
01:16:35,992 --> 01:16:38,859
- Tough night for
both of us, huh?

934
01:16:38,861 --> 01:16:40,494
You should get to bed.

935
01:16:40,496 --> 01:16:42,563
- I wanna stay in here a while.

936
01:16:42,565 --> 01:16:44,465
- Well don't wake her.

937
01:18:05,815 --> 01:18:07,481
- Kara.

938
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:23,364
Kara.

939
01:18:26,936 --> 01:18:29,236
- I tried to stop her!

940
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:37,011
- Mom!

941
01:18:56,698 --> 01:18:59,366
- Mommy made the same
sounds as Norman.

942
01:19:02,572 --> 01:19:05,406
I wonder what
sounds you'll make?

943
01:19:14,015 --> 01:19:14,949
- Don't!

944
01:19:14,951 --> 01:19:16,150
Don't do that, leave her alone!

945
01:19:16,152 --> 01:19:17,485
- But she could hurt herself.

946
01:19:17,487 --> 01:19:20,321
- She's not gonna hurt herself.

947
01:19:20,323 --> 01:19:23,958
I want her to come out
of this on her own.

948
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,626
- What did I tell you?

949
01:19:25,628 --> 01:19:27,628
- Woah, that's a first.

950
01:19:28,463 --> 01:19:30,464
What do you know?

951
01:19:30,466 --> 01:19:33,868
- That was absolutely
amazing, young lady.

952
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:36,604
It was an incredible
first session.

953
01:19:36,606 --> 01:19:38,773
Now, I do not want her sedated.

954
01:19:38,775 --> 01:19:40,908
I want her to be
left to herself.

955
01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:42,643
I want her to be able to
come to terms with this,

956
01:19:42,645 --> 01:19:45,112
come to terms with being
a psychotic killer.

957
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:46,046
- No!

958
01:19:46,048 --> 01:19:47,048
No, no!

959
01:19:50,653 --> 01:19:51,653
No!

960
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:01,362
- It's okay.

961
01:20:01,364 --> 01:20:02,563
It's all right, it's over.

962
01:20:02,565 --> 01:20:04,665
It's over, it's okay.

963
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:08,002
It's okay.

964
01:20:12,107 --> 01:20:13,841
- Time to go.

965
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:19,079
Damon, you're up.

966
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:39,800
- Damon believes in
vampires, he always has,

967
01:20:39,802 --> 01:20:42,136
always will, no matter
what the doctors tell him.

968
01:20:42,138 --> 01:20:46,006
He was arrested after
hiring someone to kill

969
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:49,743
several people who he
thought were vampires.

970
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:10,297
- Sir?

971
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:24,345
- Damon, what a pleasure.

972
01:21:24,347 --> 01:21:25,412
Have a seat.

973
01:21:26,748 --> 01:21:28,215
- I'd rather not.

974
01:21:29,317 --> 01:21:30,651
- But I insist.

975
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:48,335
- I wouldn't mess
with this one, doc.

976
01:21:55,877 --> 01:21:57,778
- You gentlemen can go.

977
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:00,180
I'll call you if I need you.

978
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:16,030
- Shall I begin, Dr. Marcus?

979
01:22:16,032 --> 01:22:19,166
- You don't waste time, do you?

980
01:22:19,168 --> 01:22:21,735
- They told me about you.

981
01:22:21,737 --> 01:22:25,906
They said you were really
interested in hearing our stories.

982
01:22:25,908 --> 01:22:26,974
- It's true.

983
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:32,813
- Actually, I tell my story
to anyone who'll listen.

984
01:22:32,815 --> 01:22:36,450
Problem is, none of the
other doctors believe me.

985
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:39,353
- Well I'm not
like other doctors.

986
01:22:40,221 --> 01:22:41,956
You see, as a child,

987
01:22:42,824 --> 01:22:45,492
I used to love vampire stories.

988
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:48,762
Your case, it intrigued me.

989
01:22:48,764 --> 01:22:50,564
So I'm gonna ask you,

990
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:53,567
do vampires really exist?

991
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,974
- Humor me if you like.

992
01:23:00,942 --> 01:23:02,376
I know the truth.

993
01:23:06,548 --> 01:23:09,183
I had been following
certain people

994
01:23:09,185 --> 01:23:10,484
til I was sure.

995
01:23:11,553 --> 01:23:14,021
I hired someone to kill them.

996
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:18,525
Do you know that
vampires walk in the day?

997
01:23:18,527 --> 01:23:21,095
And they don't turn into bats.

998
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:24,665
And they only feast on blood

999
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:26,900
when they're hungry.

1000
01:23:26,902 --> 01:23:29,470
- That's fascinating.

1001
01:23:29,472 --> 01:23:30,472
- Mm-hmm.

1002
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:34,908
You learn all kinds
of things when

1003
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:38,812
you track them all over
the world like I have.

1004
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:44,451
People like you put me away.

1005
01:23:50,558 --> 01:23:51,558
Idiots.

1006
01:23:54,829 --> 01:23:56,997
They have no idea

1007
01:23:56,999 --> 01:23:57,999
of the evil

1008
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:01,001
that walks in this world.

1009
01:24:05,306 --> 01:24:08,542
Found a pack of 'em
living in England.

1010
01:24:09,844 --> 01:24:14,515
- Yeah, but somebody
believed you, didn't they?

1011
01:24:14,517 --> 01:24:15,716
Why don't you tell me about

1012
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:18,552
this man you hired
to kill the...

1013
01:24:18,554 --> 01:24:20,154
Vampires?

1014
01:24:20,156 --> 01:24:22,222
- Ah, it took some time.

1015
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:25,059
But once I showed him,

1016
01:24:26,294 --> 01:24:27,361
he believed.

1017
01:24:37,038 --> 01:24:39,673
- Di Collins reenters the room.

1018
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:42,609
Interview resumes.

1019
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:46,313
The suspect has refused
to offer his name

1020
01:24:46,315 --> 01:24:48,315
or address for the third time.

1021
01:24:55,657 --> 01:24:57,291
I'm gonna call you John.

1022
01:24:57,293 --> 01:24:58,959
That all right?

1023
01:24:58,961 --> 01:24:59,961
John?

1024
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:07,501
We found you wandering
through the station.

1025
01:25:07,503 --> 01:25:09,203
We were worried because

1026
01:25:09,205 --> 01:25:12,106
you were someone we
wanted to talk to.

1027
01:25:12,108 --> 01:25:13,574
Know why that is?

1028
01:25:21,382 --> 01:25:22,382
Janet gray.

1029
01:25:27,422 --> 01:25:29,556
Did she break your heart?

1030
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:35,095
Because you broke hers.

1031
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:52,079
You cut it right
out of her, John.

1032
01:25:52,081 --> 01:25:54,381
How did that make you feel?

1033
01:25:56,084 --> 01:25:58,485
She was just a girl.

1034
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:00,888
But Reggie, Reggie was scum.

1035
01:26:01,756 --> 01:26:03,390
Dealer, pimp.

1036
01:26:03,392 --> 01:26:04,925
Chelsea fan.

1037
01:26:04,927 --> 01:26:07,761
That's three
strikes right there.

1038
01:26:09,764 --> 01:26:12,599
You took it a bit
too far though.

1039
01:26:16,204 --> 01:26:19,273
- That's a foul,
you fucking Muppet!

1040
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:39,193
Some people would give you
a pat on the back for that.

1041
01:26:39,195 --> 01:26:40,195
But this...

1042
01:26:44,899 --> 01:26:46,433
Acid?

1043
01:26:46,435 --> 01:26:47,501
In the bath?

1044
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:17,798
That isn't normal
behavior, John.

1045
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,300
That is just not fucking odd.

1046
01:27:35,316 --> 01:27:36,617
- I hunted her.

1047
01:27:38,019 --> 01:27:40,854
Four missing girls,
all her friends.

1048
01:27:40,856 --> 01:27:42,155
No coincidence.

1049
01:27:46,027 --> 01:27:47,861
He killed seven.

1050
01:27:47,863 --> 01:27:50,530
Prostitutes, addicts, homeless.

1051
01:27:53,801 --> 01:27:56,637
And they'd been
at it for decades.

1052
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:58,905
Dig up their garden.

1053
01:27:58,907 --> 01:28:02,309
Count the bones of
the children you find.

1054
01:28:06,314 --> 01:28:09,983
I know this won't
stop you for long.

1055
01:28:09,985 --> 01:28:14,688
Sorting the truth from
the fiction took a while.

1056
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:16,657
But removing the heart.

1057
01:28:17,759 --> 01:28:18,892
Decapitation.

1058
01:28:20,194 --> 01:28:21,194
Holy water.

1059
01:28:22,597 --> 01:28:24,231
Those methods work.

1060
01:28:29,103 --> 01:28:31,805
They couldn't
exist on their own.

1061
01:28:31,807 --> 01:28:34,608
They needed
protection to survive.

1062
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:36,510
Someone to keep watch.

1063
01:28:40,748 --> 01:28:43,150
- You're confused, John.

1064
01:28:43,152 --> 01:28:45,218
You're scared and confused.

1065
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:48,055
- A confused man wouldn't have
watched you for three months.

1066
01:28:48,057 --> 01:28:52,292
He wouldn't have snuck
into this room an hour ago.

1067
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:58,398
A confused man wouldn't
have a stake in his hands.

1068
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:30,697
- When he was caught and
arrested for the murder of...

1069
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:32,099
Ordinary people.

1070
01:29:33,668 --> 01:29:35,235
He led them to me.

1071
01:29:36,771 --> 01:29:38,839
- Did that surprise you?

1072
01:29:40,441 --> 01:29:42,342
- We weren't finished.

1073
01:29:44,846 --> 01:29:47,013
- Killing vampires?

1074
01:29:47,015 --> 01:29:48,548
- Precisely.

1075
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:49,550
- Ah.

1076
01:29:52,153 --> 01:29:54,888
- There's another one out there.

1077
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:57,124
The main one.

1078
01:30:00,495 --> 01:30:01,895
And I won't stop

1079
01:30:02,797 --> 01:30:04,531
until I hunt it down

1080
01:30:05,366 --> 01:30:06,433
and kill it.

1081
01:30:19,481 --> 01:30:22,949
- Gentlemen, would
you join us, please?

1082
01:30:22,951 --> 01:30:24,484
You know Damon, I
have to tell you,

1083
01:30:24,486 --> 01:30:28,388
of all my patients, you've
been the most fascinating.

1084
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:33,427
It's been an absolute
pleasure meeting you.

1085
01:30:36,297 --> 01:30:38,698
- The pleasure was all mine.

1086
01:30:43,838 --> 01:30:44,838
Doctor.

1087
01:31:15,169 --> 01:31:17,003
- I loved my mom.

1088
01:31:17,005 --> 01:31:18,939
She was a good mom.

1089
01:31:18,941 --> 01:31:21,341
Until she started seeing it.

1090
01:31:23,411 --> 01:31:25,078
- I could see,

1091
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:27,147
and feel,

1092
01:31:28,749 --> 01:31:29,749
and hear,

1093
01:31:30,852 --> 01:31:31,852
everything!

1094
01:31:33,221 --> 01:31:34,087
- Where the
fuck is my bloody shovel?

1095
01:31:34,089 --> 01:31:35,089
- Hey!

1096
01:31:37,259 --> 01:31:41,061
- There's another one out there.

1097
01:31:41,063 --> 01:31:42,195
The main one.

1098
01:31:44,799 --> 01:31:46,199
And I won't stop

1099
01:31:47,034 --> 01:31:48,768
until I hunt it down

1100
01:31:49,604 --> 01:31:50,670
and kill it.

1101
01:33:01,776 --> 01:33:02,776
- The hell?

1102
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:25,825
- Found my shovel, doctor.

1103
01:34:38,706 --> 01:34:41,107
- What are you people doing?

1104
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:43,910
You know who I am.

1105
01:34:50,584 --> 01:34:53,053
- We sure do, doctor.

1106
01:34:53,055 --> 01:34:54,055
We sure do.

1107
01:34:55,623 --> 01:34:57,590
- Damon there are

1108
01:34:57,592 --> 01:34:59,492
no such thing

1109
01:34:59,494 --> 01:35:00,560
as vampires.

1110
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:05,699
There just isn't.

1111
01:35:08,869 --> 01:35:10,770
And I'm not a vampire.

1112
01:35:13,274 --> 01:35:14,574
He's having a hallucination,

1113
01:35:14,576 --> 01:35:17,243
he's drawing you people into it.

1114
01:35:17,245 --> 01:35:18,812
- Hmm, nice try,

1115
01:35:18,814 --> 01:35:20,714
but I'm not buying it.

1116
01:35:22,049 --> 01:35:23,783
- I'm not a vampire.

1117
01:35:25,086 --> 01:35:26,786
- Hold him down.

1118
01:35:26,788 --> 01:35:28,221
This won't take long.

1119
01:35:32,327 --> 01:35:33,426
- Ah!

1120
01:35:33,428 --> 01:35:35,662
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.

1121
01:35:37,465 --> 01:35:38,531
No, I'm not.

1122
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:40,300
No, no!

1123
01:35:41,936 --> 01:35:42,802
No!

1124
01:35:42,804 --> 01:35:43,804
No, no!

1125
01:35:52,813 --> 01:35:53,880
- It's okay.

1126
01:35:55,516 --> 01:35:56,683
Just breathe.

1127
01:35:58,419 --> 01:35:59,419
Breathe.

1128
01:36:13,701 --> 01:36:14,834
Just breathe.

1129
01:36:15,836 --> 01:36:17,570
- You know who I am?

1130
01:36:18,572 --> 01:36:20,373
Do you know who I am?

1131
01:36:21,909 --> 01:36:24,444
- Yes, we know who you are.

1132
01:36:24,446 --> 01:36:26,179
Thank you gentlemen.

1133
01:36:27,414 --> 01:36:28,414
Keys.

1134
01:36:37,224 --> 01:36:39,159
You're not a renowned author.

1135
01:36:39,161 --> 01:36:40,794
You're not a doctor.

1136
01:36:40,796 --> 01:36:42,228
You're Daniel Marcus,

1137
01:36:42,230 --> 01:36:43,563
patient 050980.

1138
01:36:44,932 --> 01:36:47,467
You've been a patient at this
facility for over 30 years.

1139
01:36:47,469 --> 01:36:48,935
You were admitted after
being found guilty

1140
01:36:48,937 --> 01:36:50,904
of murdering your mother, aunt,

1141
01:36:50,906 --> 01:36:53,106
uncle and cousin,

1142
01:36:53,108 --> 01:36:55,108
while on a skiing trip.

1143
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:57,577
Your attorney managed
to have you placed here

1144
01:36:57,579 --> 01:37:00,246
in our care after
an insanity plea.

1145
01:37:02,417 --> 01:37:03,417
- Paul...

1146
01:37:06,187 --> 01:37:07,554
- We've discussed
this before, Daniel,

1147
01:37:07,556 --> 01:37:09,389
it's doctor Victor.

1148
01:37:09,391 --> 01:37:12,292
Only my friends call me Paul.

1149
01:37:12,294 --> 01:37:14,194
And we're not friends.

1150
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:20,233
Another bad dream.

1151
01:37:21,335 --> 01:37:23,269
Well, hopefully,

1152
01:37:23,271 --> 01:37:25,104
we can get you to see the
truth about what you did

1153
01:37:25,106 --> 01:37:28,241
and the delusions and
nightmares will eventually stop.

1154
01:37:28,243 --> 01:37:31,344
Pains me to leave you
here in a single cell.

1155
01:37:31,346 --> 01:37:33,246
But with all your
recent outbursts,

1156
01:37:33,248 --> 01:37:35,114
you've left me little choice.

1157
01:37:35,116 --> 01:37:37,150
The other patients, and
even some of the staff,

1158
01:37:37,152 --> 01:37:38,451
are frightened of you.

1159
01:37:42,723 --> 01:37:47,260
I'd like to move you back
into the main ward, but,

1160
01:37:47,262 --> 01:37:50,597
I'm gonna need you
to help me help you.

1161
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:57,537
I'm going to give you one more
chance to tell me the truth.

1162
01:37:59,373 --> 01:38:01,975
Take me back to where it began.

1163
01:38:08,182 --> 01:38:09,415
- I was young.

1164
01:38:10,818 --> 01:38:13,253
I didn't wanna hurt anybody.

1165
01:38:13,255 --> 01:38:14,988
I didn't hurt my family.

1166
01:38:14,990 --> 01:38:17,156
I wouldn't hurt my mother.

1167
01:38:17,158 --> 01:38:18,825
I wouldn't hurt her.

1168
01:38:18,827 --> 01:38:19,827
No.

1169
01:38:48,155 --> 01:38:49,155
- Shh.

1170
01:47:58,638 --> 01:48:01,240
I wouldn't hurt my mother.

1171
01:48:05,779 --> 01:48:07,413
- Well I was hoping
we would make

1172
01:48:07,415 --> 01:48:09,582
some progress, Daniel, but...

1173
01:48:09,584 --> 01:48:12,985
You just wanna tell
outrageous stories.

1174
01:48:12,987 --> 01:48:14,653
- They're all true.

1175
01:48:15,722 --> 01:48:17,223
They're all true.

1176
01:48:18,892 --> 01:48:20,092
- You really expect
me to believe

1177
01:48:20,094 --> 01:48:22,595
your tall tales
about serial killers,

1178
01:48:22,597 --> 01:48:25,498
demons, vampires,
ghosts, zombies?

1179
01:48:26,833 --> 01:48:29,001
The truth is, you murdered
multiple people in cold blood,

1180
01:48:29,003 --> 01:48:31,537
starting with your own family.

1181
01:48:31,539 --> 01:48:33,172
Instead of taking
responsibility for it,

1182
01:48:33,174 --> 01:48:35,207
you'd rather make
up fairy tales.

1183
01:48:35,209 --> 01:48:36,942
Well you might have
everybody else fooled,

1184
01:48:36,944 --> 01:48:38,978
but you're nothing but a liar,

1185
01:48:38,980 --> 01:48:40,779
who faked his mental
state of health

1186
01:48:40,781 --> 01:48:43,449
to avoid the death penalty.

1187
01:48:51,992 --> 01:48:53,225
You can stay down
here for the rest

1188
01:48:53,227 --> 01:48:56,428
of your miserable
life for all I care.

1189
01:48:58,798 --> 01:49:00,032
You know what?

1190
01:49:03,103 --> 01:49:06,305
I am still gonna
have a good day.

1191
01:49:28,428 --> 01:49:31,263
- How's that for
a good day, huh?

1192
01:50:19,579 --> 01:50:21,313
My patients need me.

1193
01:50:30,724 --> 01:50:33,125
I only let my friends
call me Daniel.

1194
01:50:33,127 --> 01:50:35,527
You can help me help you.

1195
01:50:35,529 --> 01:50:38,263
I'm still gonna have a good day.

1196
01:50:46,539 --> 01:50:48,540
Time to make my rounds.

1197
01:50:59,719 --> 01:51:00,619
- Welcome back...

1198
01:51:00,621 --> 01:51:01,620
Oh help!

1199
01:51:01,622 --> 01:51:03,856
Help!
