1
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,060
OK, recent studies
have shown that

2
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,020
one in four men
cheats on their wives.

3
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,060
And one in ten women,
cheats on their husbands.

4
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,260
Ray, I will explain.

5
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,580
Hey man, I'm so sorry...

6
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,460
Now that's aweful.
Truly depressing data.

7
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,860
I know this must look bad,
but it's not what it looks like.

8
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,060
- You, stop talking now.
- Okay.

9
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,500
Dorothy, you see
the red Potiac Fierro outside?

10
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,500
He works for your husband.

11
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,780
But then I realized,

12
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,020
imagine how much more impressive
those numbers could be,

13
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,060
if people thought they could
actually get away with it?

14
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,420
Here put these up

15
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,700
Two minutes, out the door.
I will take care of the photographer.

16
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,820
You, ten minutes after that,

17
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,260
half a mile down the road
there's an Exxon garage

18
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,300
call a cab.

19
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,540
Cynical?
Well, I prefer entrepreneurial.

20
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,860
My former partner,
the Great Jack McCadden

21
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,220
taught me, our job in life
is not to judge the ones

22
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,300
and desires of our fellow men

23
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,060
is to profit upon them.

24
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,500
And well, some might see this
as an unravelling of our social fabric

25
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,740
I say business is good.

26
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,780
- Ray
- Ray, my files are ready

27
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,500
Do me a favour, will you?

28
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,780
Double check the receipts
for the Feing account.

29
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,260
I'm super sorry about the other night, Ray.
I just lost her.

30
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,020
It's not good enough, Vic.

31
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,860
That's the third time
in the last three months.

32
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,740
Ray, we deed three dollars for
Wendy's birthday cake.

33
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,860
That is two months severance.

34
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,300
You need any contacts,
we'll hook you up.

35
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,020
We've got some issues with
the new DMV holographs.

36
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,060
Give it to Walter.

37
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,900
Do you want to sign off
on the new souvenirs?

38
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,660
Track me down this afternoon.

39
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,660
Ray I need approval on the travel account.

40
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,820
I did it, it's on your desk.

41
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,860
- Ray, this OK?
- Good.

42
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,980
New client?

43
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,300
Your eleven o'clock. you said you wanted
bigger brains around here.

44
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,860
Don't let the twins fool you.

45
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,620
They may look affectionate, but they're
actually in a battle for tank dominance.

46
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,140
They also like to breed
under banana leafs.

47
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,660
You can call me Lola.

48
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,420
- OK, let's go by
- Ray?

49
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,740
Benjamin's root canal is going over.

50
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,140
Also Peter Miller's pass code
isn't scanning the rhythm...

51
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,140
And I will talk to you
about it later.

52
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,740
So Lola, do you have any lunch plans?

53
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,300
You worked under Randall Pual.
Can I ask why you left?

54
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,980
I was one of seventeen Jr. VPs in out division

55
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,140
specializing interest derivatives,
market risk exposure,

56
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,660
plus a little P/L analyses
on the side.

57
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,900
- Sounds...
- almost as dull as it was.

58
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,980
And just a point of clarification,
I work with people, and for people,

59
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,300
never under them.

60
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,500
And what would you say
Your best quality?

61
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,220
- My patience.
- Great, great.

62
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,540
So, how close to the street are you?

63
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,420
Your shoes. Very fashionable

64
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,620
about five or six years ago.

65
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,460
You look like a woman who would care.

66
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,500
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- OK

67
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,860
I had banked some stock options from
this blossoming internet start-up,

68
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,900
and decided to seek enlightenment
in the Holy land.

69
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,980
I would have guessed Tibet...

70
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,460
I'm old school.

71
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,940
Can I ask you a question?

72
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,580
What exactly do you do?

73
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,700
Well this is a surprise.

74
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,620
- Putty. Good to see you.
- How the fuck are you, man?

75
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,700
Fucking good.

76
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,620
Getting any work?

77
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,340
I'm Retired.

78
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,900
I banked some stock options
from this blossoming internet start-up,

79
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,340
then decided to seek enlightenment in Tibet...
by the middle East.

80
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,660
The Holy land, huh? No shit.

81
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,980
Ray

82
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,500
I hear Jack's back on the radar.

83
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,900
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

84
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,260
No? Don't keep in touch with your old boss?

85
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,260
You guys were like...Batman and Robin.

86
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,740
Without the capes, of course.

87
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,580
I hear he was seen at the airport

88
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,780
he's hiding out in a bangalow
just up the coast.

89
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,900
Yeah, I heard it was a villa in Sweden.

90
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,380
I wouldn't put too much stock in idle gossip.

91
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,380
Nothing idle about a 5 million dollar
contract on the guy's head.

92
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,740
Excuse me, Sir?
We need to keep this lane clear.

93
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,940
I was looking for some good guys.

94
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,540
Ma'am

95
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,940
Fuck are you looking at?

96
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,260
That was interesting, little creepy.

97
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,300
- So what can you tell me about him?
- I just met him.

98
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,420
I'd say high school graduate,

99
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,780
possibly a missionary or insurance salesman

100
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,220
although with obvious connections
to some sort of criminal enterprise.

101
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,780
Okay, what else?

102
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,060
So you know this, or you've heard this?

103
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,620
I know that Jack McCadden
conned the Sultan Qatar

104
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,180
out of 15 million dollars.

105
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,180
Yeah that's the legend.

106
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,020
What about this Ray fellow?

107
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,100
He was always just the frontman
Word is after the score

108
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,260
Jack disappeared with Ray's cut
of the Sultan's cash.

109
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,700
A Sultan?
That's some real Indiana Jones shit that is.

110
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,820
- Language Bobo.
- Sorry

111
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,900
- And would you say he is...
- Married or single?

112
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,940
Divorced.

113
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,220
If there were a woman's life

114
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,260
she'd make him a babe
little more with him

115
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,620
Excuse me.

116
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,460
So is this Sultan still want Jack bit?

117
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,860
What I hear, 5 million open contract
on Jack McCadden's head.

118
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,500
5 million's a lot of money.

119
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,260
To clip a gifter, it certainly is.

120
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,980
OK, where is he now?

121
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,380
No no no, I will take it.

122
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,020
So, when can you start?

123
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,940
You asked me two questions
and offer me the job?

124
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,900
Ah, three.

125
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,500
I have sense about people.
We have to leave.

126
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,380
Now.

127
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,380
Seems like our new friend Ray
knows a very valuable man.

128
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,340
I don't know if Ray is still in touch.

129
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,260
He's handsome.

130
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,460
I think he's found religion.

131
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,260
What good is it for man to have faith,
if his actions do not prove it.

132
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,540
Con men don't reform.

133
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,420
They simply find better angles.

134
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,460
OK What do we do? We're a risk management firm.

135
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,500
- Which means?
- We're in the business of saving marriages.

136
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,540
How do you do that?

137
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,020
We grease the way
that makes state-of-the-art infidelity possible.

138
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,580
People who cheat get caught because, A they want to,

139
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,580
or B they're found somewhere they said they weren't.

140
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,180
Goodmorning Jay Z Incorporated?

141
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,060
Mr Williams is in meeting right now,
may I take a message?

142
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,260
We create a false reality,
making people appear to be

143
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,700
where they're supposed to be.

144
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,340
Adams and Randalph.

145
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,780
Mr North? Let me check.

146
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,660
I'm sorry, your wife
just got on a conference call.

147
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,500
I will try it when she gets off.

148
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,140
Fifth precinct.

149
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,140
Sykes?
He's running files to central. Can I help you?

150
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,820
I can try him on his walkie if it's an emergency.

151
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,500
So you help men cheat on their wives?

152
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,220
And wives cheat on their husbands.

153
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,980
We're an equal opportunity employer.

154
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,020
You're a professional liar.

155
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,140
Lies are the great foundation
of our society, Lola.

156
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,820
'Great outfit, honey.'
'Can't I give you flowers for no reason?'

157
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,660
And my personal favorite,
'Don't worry, it happens to lots of guys.'

158
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,380
But that's just being polite.

159
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,380
Fact is your average relationship
wouldn't last two minutes

160
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,260
if people told the truth.

161
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,660
We just help maintain the illusion.

162
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,300
Mom's happy, Dad's happy

163
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,380
and the kids don't have to
pick sides at Christmas.

164
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,380
So this is all for the children, then?

165
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,460
Families don't break up because of infidelity,

166
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,340
Thank you.

167
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,860
They break up because someone get caught.

168
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,220
Let me guess,

169
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,780
You're just a hard-working child
of a broken home

170
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,380
trying to save others
from the pain you went through.

171
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,780
I just see people for the well dressed,
good smelling animals they are.

172
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,620
Mate, eat, sleep and mate some more,
preferably with someone else. Come on.

173
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,060
But you can't really believe that.

174
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,980
Not everyone operate
on a purely primal level.

175
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,540
A man is as faithful as his opportunities.
Take your old boss, for example.

176
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,100
Perfect example.
Yes, he cheated on his wife they broke up

177
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,620
They got back together
they never been happier

178
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,060
When was that, about a year ago?

179
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,900
Yeah, How did you know that?

180
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,140
He just bought us lunch.
Been a client since January.

181
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,060
Are you ready?

182
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,980
I'll let you know.

183
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,300
You dare defy your emperor!

184
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,620
Robert? Lobby, two minutes.

185
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,380
And you might want to
put the jacket on.

186
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,620
Morning?

187
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,940
You ever consider a more traditional line of work?

188
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,220
Insurance? Sales?

189
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,260
Making money's easy.

190
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,020
Keeping yourself interested
is something else entirely.

191
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,580
OK here's the situation.

192
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,460
In a few seconds,
an angry wife is going to

193
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,700
steaming through that door

194
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,100
and raise Mary hell till
she finds her cheating husband.

195
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,540
Inside this is
a cheap knock-off necklace.

196
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,140
You can be anyone you want to be
for the next five minutes.

197
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,140
I need two thousand a week,
benefits and a month off

198
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,460
plus all the regular holidays.

199
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,460
We tend to work holidays,

200
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,860
we've got great dental
and I can go as high as 1,500.

201
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,580
What's going on here, Ray?

202
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,860
- Hey how ya doing there?
- One second, vision?

203
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,420
That comes with a co-pay.

204
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,620
OK, the objective
is to extricate him

205
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,860
from this situation
with his balls intact.

206
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,620
Ray...

207
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,820
Son of a bitch...

208
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,700
- Holy shit.
- How could you!

209
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,980
I give you the best years of my life

210
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,300
and you go and throw it away
to have your sick sex with some whore.

211
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,740
I don't know who you think
you think you are, Mrs. Hatch,

212
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,540
but no one speaks to me like that.

213
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,980
I can't work like this, Mr. Hatch.

214
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,660
We are Rogette's jewelers,
not Bob's Big House of Diamonds.

215
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,700
Diamonds?

216
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,660
To my dearest on this special day.

217
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,300
Much love.

218
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,660
But why are you meeting here?

219
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,300
Our office is in New york, so

220
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,220
Mr. Hatch has been flying in
members of our team

221
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,020
to work on the design

222
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,420
Robert...

223
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,060
Do you like it?

224
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,180
Robert...

225
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,060
I think this concludes our business, Mr Hatch.

226
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,260
So if I want to examine some other items
from your catalogue,

227
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,180
how could we arrange that?

228
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:37,020
I can have a catalogue
forwarded to your hotel room in Fiji.

229
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,580
You didn't tell her?

230
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,180
Robert!

231
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,940
- We need to go to Rodeo Drive, Hannibal.
- Yes, Mrs. Hatch.

232
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,940
Mr. Hatch needs new swim togs.

233
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,060
And in the future,
I'd rather you didn't improvise travel arrangements.

234
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,700
I was in the moment.

235
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,380
I'll also need a cell phone.

236
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,900
And moment or not, you didn't
have to make it a private island.

237
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,380
We both know he had it coming.

238
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,140
Company car?

239
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,380
I guess anyone can get away
with anything these days.

240
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,300
No we don't alibi crimes,

241
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,900
I will not be an instrument
of recrimination or revenge.

242
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,220
- Beyond that...
- Beyond that?

243
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,940
It's all smoke and mirrors.

244
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,260
So how rich do people
have to be to hire us?

245
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,700
We give discounts to cops, plumbers,
hotel workers and teachers.

246
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,220
Nice to give something back
to the chronically under-paid.

247
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,260
If it makes you feel better,
sometimes our clients stray

248
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,660
but then they go back a little wiser
for the experience.

249
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,980
Anything else?

250
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,980
Overtime, dress code?

251
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,260
Yes, for both.

252
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,700
Do we have a deal?

253
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,260
If I'm there for more than a year,
I want profit sharing.

254
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,060
OK on one condition.

255
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,100
Don't slap the spouse.

256
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,300
Don't micromanage.

257
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,020
Profit sharing?

258
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,020
Perhaps that was a bit much.

259
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,540
But I was temporarily seduced
by her lavish penetrating, truly sublime

260
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,260
attention to detail.

261
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,700
You see my current line of work
is all about

262
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,740
planning for every conceivable contingency

263
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,140
Accounting for every detail.

264
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,420
Every nuance, and every possible mistake.

265
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,340
I know exactly where he is.

266
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,300
Why?

267
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,420
Because I commit the one unpardonable sin.

268
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,780
The one my old partner Jack
would never abide.

269
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,140
I'm forced, on a daily basis

270
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,300
to rely on the intelligence of others

271
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,220
Ten days, Ray.

272
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,780
Ten days I had sleep with my wife.
You got any idea how that is?

273
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,700
Break the rules, these thing happen.

274
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,860
By the way, you'll be
swapping the necklace

275
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,500
You gave her with a real one
in about two days.

276
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,740
I've already billed your account.

277
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,500
You realize I actually had to...

278
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,420
I shudder just thinking about it.

279
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,420
You could always leave her, Robert.

280
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,100
Hey I'd leave, I'd leave in a heartbeat,

281
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,300
it's no secret the money's
all from her family.

282
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,860
I leave, I'm ruined you know that.

283
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,460
We all have our crosses to bear, right?
Now, for our lesson in remedial cheating.

284
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,620
Those damned matches.
Stupid habit.

285
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,740
I just keep losing my lighters.

286
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,580
Nothing from your liaisons
goes in your pockets,

287
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,180
on your breath or on your skin.
Got it?

288
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,380
Robert? you've already met Lola.

289
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,780
My son's getting married next month.

290
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,780
Good girl from a good family.

291
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,620
But you know the Hatch men...

292
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,020
You know, we always have
a little something on the side

293
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:40,300
that my grandfather, my father, me
and now my kid, can you believe it?

294
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,540
Amazing.

295
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,620
So, where's he not supposed
to be going

296
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,940
and who's he not supposed
to be going with?

297
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:54,220
Ray, I'd appreciate it if you handled this yourself.

298
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,740
Robert, apart for
the odd emergency,

299
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,220
I do very little fieldwork
these days.

300
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,580
You're my last personal client.

301
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,580
Yeah but I was your first client.

302
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,940
Think of it as a wedding present
to my fucking kid.

303
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:11,220
One you get to bill for.
After that, Lola takes care of me.

304
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,820
OK?

305
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,700
OK.

306
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,500
Don't let the Hatch thing bother you.
Some clients just prefer working with men.

307
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,980
So that man was your first client?

308
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,820
That man's libido paid the rent
for the first few months.

309
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,820
What? No start-up help
from the infamous Jack McCadden?

310
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,140
No.

311
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,260
He sounds like quite the character.

312
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,300
International man of intrigue.
Smart, handsome.

313
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,820
How long did you two date?

314
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,860
Okay, Jack is not a topic I care to discuss.

315
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,260
Bad break up?

316
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,500
Drop it.

317
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,660
Dropped.

318
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,140
She wants a friar to marry us.

319
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,860
A fucking friar, like what am I, Robin Hood?

320
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,340
Look, don't get me wrong.
I love Sandy. I fucking worship her.

321
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,460
Shit. "Til death do us part?'

322
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,980
Men aren't wired to be monogamous.
I'm sorry

323
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,740
You know, we gotta spread the seed.

324
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,540
Your father tells me
You want to go away for the weekend?

325
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,740
That's terrible, right? I'm a terrible person.

326
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,460
I don't know you, Wendell.

327
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,980
Yeah, I guess you're right.

328
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,020
- Alright, so this girl, do I tell you her name?
- No.

329
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,820
Alright, she wants to go to
a bed and breakfast in Santa Barbara.

330
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,500
Are Click and Clack going too?

331
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,740
What?

332
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,820
No dude. Just me and her.

333
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,260
OK. There's a brokers' convention
in San Francisco this weekend.

334
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,660
I'll book you a room
in San Francisco under your name

335
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,460
and reserve a flight
and a rental car.

336
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,620
OK.

337
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,580
Then I will book a room in Santa Barbara under my name

338
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,380
and give you a credit card to use while you're up there.

339
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,980
Friday, you go to Santa Barbara
and I go to San Francisco,

340
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,540
where I check into your room
and sign in at the convention.

341
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,140
I have dinner, make phone calls.

342
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,620
In short, you become me
and I become you.

343
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,380
Temporarily.

344
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,860
And when Sandy tries to call me?

345
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,140
We intercept all the calls.

346
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,980
If there's an emergency
I'll be contacted

347
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,980
and I will contact you.

348
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,220
Shit.

349
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,300
Dude, do you have a card?

350
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,020
I don't.

351
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,220
Anything else? No, I'm good.

352
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,820
Good.

353
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,260
Wendell.

354
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,940
In the future, don't make me do this
in front of your wife.

355
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,580
It's kind of tacky...

356
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,220
and it'll get you caught. Guaranteed.

357
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,060
It'd be easy for a man in my line of work
to become

358
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,740
cynical on the subject of relationships

359
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,380
So what's in San Francisco?

360
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,580
It's business.

361
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,020
What's her name?

362
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,740
Lola, I prefer to keep my work life
and my private life separate.

363
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,540
- It keeps things simple.
- Simple is boring.

364
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,860
Boring is safe.

365
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,500
And safe is for old people.

366
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,860
This is fun, want to keep going?

367
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,580
I got a plane to catch.

368
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,620
Have a good weekend?

369
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,660
But you see, romance is my greatest ally.

370
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:34,140
That makes people vulnerable.
Distracts it, and utterly idiotic.

371
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,260
You sure, you didn't tell anyone?

372
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,020
In short, perfect clients.

373
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,300
We've been over this a thousand times.

374
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,940
What did you tell your boyfriend?

375
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,980
That I'm visiting my mom.

376
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,260
Trust me, he's an idiot.

377
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,060
So after the wedding,
how long before we can get together?

378
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,940
I don't know we might have to
cool it for a little...

379
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,380
Oh shit, does your boyfriend
drive a black SUV?

380
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,700
No.

381
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,820
Will you calm down?

382
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,860
Did you ever get a blow job
at a hundred miles an hour?

383
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,740
We're only going sixty.

384
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,140
Then you better step on it.

385
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,580
Hey, hey.

386
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,300
One second!

387
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,540
You've got about ten seconds
before I rip off all your clothes

388
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,660
and fuck you right here
in the lobby.

389
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,700
Can't wait to do that.

390
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,180
Now, what can I do for you
nice young people?

391
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,420
We have a room booked.
Under Elliottt. Mr. And Mrs. Ray Elliottt.

392
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,380
Hi. Wendell Hatch, arrogant prick.

393
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,060
<i>Wendell</i>

394
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,540
Hi Wendell Hatch, good to meet you.

395
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,900
Hi Wendell.

396
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,980
Hello.

397
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,700
You son of a bitch.

398
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,620
Takes one to know one, Mr. Williams.

399
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,740
Good to see you.

400
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,940
God, didn't we have a hell
of a time in Bermuda?

401
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,020
My liver's still not talking to me.

402
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,060
They forget to print you a name tag?

403
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,020
That's what you get for pre-registering.

404
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,220
Say Michael, you ever talk to
that tax shelter guy

405
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,300
What was his name,
Jack something?

406
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,260
No I was hoping you could tell me

407
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,380
I got so much loose change
tied up with that guy.

408
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,580
Now I can't get the bastard on the phone.

409
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,740
So you know what Jack used to say
the only sure investment is tombstone.

410
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,060
I know what it means.

411
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,100
Come on I want you to
meet somebody. Hey Jimmy!

412
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,540
Come on.

413
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,940
Oh my god.

414
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,740
Oh my god.

415
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,220
That was amazing.

416
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,620
All tingling.

417
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,660
Hello.

418
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,900
Hey, sugar,

419
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,420
how's work going?

420
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,180
Nope, just hanging out with my sister.

421
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,740
You want to say hi?

422
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,140
Hang on...

423
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,780
Sorry, Babe, she's in the bathroom.

424
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:03,340
Yeah, me too.

425
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,780
Study hard.

426
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,900
What are you doing?
You tring to get me killed?

427
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,940
Have you...

428
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,460
Now, while we let the little
blue pills kick in,

429
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,060
it's my turn.

430
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,100
OK, now what...

431
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,380
- You could have scratched me.
- The closer I get, the harder you pull.

432
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,460
Okay. But what if I hurt you?

433
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,100
Yes, please.

434
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,420
Fine, the safety word is 'gum'

435
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,300
Okay.

436
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,380
- Hello?
- Ray?

437
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,900
Who is this?

438
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,100
I think she's dead, Ray.

439
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,180
I don't...she's not waking up.

440
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,780
- Wendell?
- Hell fucked. This is so FUCKED.

441
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,420
Okay Wendell, get a hold of yourself.

442
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,580
She, you know, she liked it rough.

443
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,460
I just, I thought I was...

444
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,900
She didn't say 'gum' Ray

445
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,540
I was listening, she never said 'gum'!

446
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,780
Wendell, did you check her pulse?

447
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,420
She's blue. That's not normal, right?

448
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,620
Listen to me. Check her pulse.
Do you know how to do that?

449
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,060
I gotta get out of here.
I can't stay here.

450
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,460
Now Wendell, you must not leave the room.
Do you hear?

451
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,660
You need to call an ambulance.
It was an accident.

452
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,380
I can't go to jail
I'm not going to jail.

453
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,820
If I fucking call an ambulance.

454
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,620
This whole thing comes out,
do you understand me?

455
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,780
You, your business, my father,
Your clients, this whole thing.

456
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,900
- You gonna be ruined.
- Well It wouldn't be the first time.

457
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,940
Bull-shit. you work for me, goddamn it
You have to do what I say Ray.

458
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,140
It doesn't work like that Wendell?

459
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,540
You gotta help me please.

460
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,660
Please don't make me beg, man.

461
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,700
Please help me.

462
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,340
Okay I'll call you back in five minutes.
Don't fucking move.

463
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,860
Bobo, get increase on your money.

464
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,300
Just little bit.

465
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,180
Putty.

466
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,060
Hello?

467
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,860
Hello?

468
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,380
Hey Putty, it's Ray.

469
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,340
You up for
a little freelance work?

470
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,500
Ray?

471
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,740
Someone's coming to solve this out.

472
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,780
Oh Jesus Christ,
thank you so much, Thank you.

473
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,060
Now Wendell, this is very important,
so please pay attention,

474
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:42,740
Okay.

475
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:47,740
When he gets there, do NOT give him
Your real name, do you understand?

476
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,340
I'm Wendell. I mean Pete.

477
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,500
Hey Wendell.

478
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,940
- She come with the room?
- What?

479
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,940
Did the dead girl come with the room

480
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,500
- or did you bring her here yourself?
- It was an accident.

481
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,940
- Usually is.
- No, it was her idea.

482
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,980
I doubt that.

483
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,180
So no one saw you moved the body?

484
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,420
No.

485
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,420
Wendell. Wendell, look at me.

486
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,420
Did anybody know you were
taking her out of town?

487
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,580
No. I mean, the guys knew I was going,
but they didn't know who.

488
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,100
Is anyone likey come looking for her?

489
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,020
She has a Mexican.

490
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,380
She has a boyfriend who is Mexican

491
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,420
He is a Hispanic-American,

492
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,580
but he would fucking
kill us both if he knew.

493
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,860
The guy at the bed and breakfast saw me.
I think he saw me.

494
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,900
- You know this was all her idea.
- Shut up, Wendell.

495
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:04,060
Did you have any idea?
You killed a girl.

496
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,980
I'm sorry, believe me.
Fuck you think I want this to happen?

497
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:13,260
Look, the good thing is
it's your name on the town bill, right?

498
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,340
Not mine, so technically
I wasn't even there.

499
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,140
You're not gonna tell my dad, are you?

500
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,140
Give me my credit card.

501
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,540
Okay get moving

502
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,700
And don't, ever ever
let me see you again.

503
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,940
Hello, is this the number for reporting
a lost credit card?

504
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,380
Yeah.

505
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,860
Ray Elliott.

506
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,060
Hello.

507
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,340
I know what you are thinking

508
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,700
but a deal is a deal.

509
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:27,260
Darling, you should really try
and give me a little more notice.

510
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,300
Come on in.

511
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,860
Sorry to interrupt. Are you busy?

512
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,540
Yes, Ray, I was having a glamour night.

513
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,460
I'm goint to...

514
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:44,500
I'm going to tell you something
and I don't want you to ask any questions.

515
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,500
Well, we all know how good I am at that.

516
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,860
We slept together last night.

517
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,500
Did I like it?

518
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,900
I said no questions, remember?

519
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,860
- Did you like it?
- Lola.

520
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,420
How do you know I wasn't
with someone else last night?

521
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,180
Were you?

522
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,100
I thought the idea was
to keep our private life

523
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,820
and work life separate?

524
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,780
Okay,

525
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,300
go ahead.

526
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,140
You invited me over yesterday morning.

527
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,700
I showed up at seven-thirty PM
with a bottle of wine.

528
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,700
- What kind?
- Merlot.

529
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,220
And you cooked me dinner.

530
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,460
Don't tell this story my mother.
She'll know you're making it up.

531
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,100
A roast.

532
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,380
Lasagna. I can make lasagna.

533
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,060
Fine, lasagna.

534
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,900
I showed up at seven-thirty, we had dinner

535
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,300
and I didn't leave until
nine o'clock in the morning.

536
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,020
Just one more question.

537
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,380
What?

538
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,900
Are you gonna call me?

539
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,260
So you are the only one
that put my kid and that fucking girl

540
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,900
together at the bed and breakfast.

541
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,700
Plus the inn keeper but

542
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,740
I don't see how anyone's gonna register
in the cop's radar.

543
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,740
So how much do you
want to make this go away?

544
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,460
That's not what this is about.

545
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:30,300
I will give you 23 grand cash
right now to keep my kid out of it.

546
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,500
Hey that's what I've got.
My emergency cash reserve.

547
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,500
Robert, I don't want your money.

548
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:40,180
Hello, leaving the fucking conversation.

549
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:50,020
Our actions have consequences.
Yours, mine, everyone's.

550
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,100
Wait a minuite.

551
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,060
If this is some kind of con Ray

552
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,020
I pay up, and this chick shows up with

553
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,220
my 23 grand on some beach somewhere.

554
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,660
No way, no fucking way.

555
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,100
She's dead

556
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,660
Your son killed her. Deal with it.

557
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,500
So that I don't have to.

558
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,020
Okay Ray.

559
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,500
I will see what I can do.

560
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,180
- This is Carol.
- Hey it's Ray.

561
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,460
You working this weekend?

562
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,460
Come on man, you know that I never sleep.

563
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,140
So I heard my old friend might be in town.

564
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,540
- You heard anything?
- You mean Jack McCadden?

565
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,180
I've been waiting to call you.

566
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,900
He just came in.

567
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,940
And now, direct from an extended tour
where he played for and with many of the

568
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,860
crown'ed heads of Arabia and their wives...

569
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,860
Cam? Is this a joke?

570
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,300
What?

571
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,420
That's not Jack McCadden.

572
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,820
Are you sure?

573
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:23,060
Same age, same build?

574
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,940
But here's the thing
Jack doesn't have a snake tatooed on his face.

575
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,740
Or a steel bolt through his penis.

576
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,300
I gotta go.

577
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,660
Can I help you?

578
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,540
Detective Bryce to see Mr. Elliott.

579
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,580
Sorry! Never seen her before.

580
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,060
Right.

581
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,460
And your credit card was stolen or lost

582
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,820
just the day before it was used
to check in to the Bed and Breakfast.

583
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,900
Neat how that worked out, isn't it?

584
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:13,420
- You're not LAPD, are you?
- Used to be. I'm in Santa Barbara, now.

585
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,980
That's where the prices and
their occationally wayward daughter live.

586
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:23,180
What exactly do you do here
at Elliott Consulting, Mr. Elliott?

587
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,540
Risk assessment and management.

588
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,820
As a former confidence man
become an expert on that?

589
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,300
The same way you got to Carnegie Hall, Detective.

590
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,020
Practice, practice, practice.

591
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,740
Where is Ms. Price, Mr. Elliott?

592
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:43,140
Or should I call you Mr. Avalon,
Mr. Morgan, Mr. Weil.

593
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,300
- Detective, I swear to God
- What about

594
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,100
Your old boss Jack McCadden?
Would he know?

595
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,820
I heard this crazy story
the other day

596
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,860
about a really rich Arab
wanting to see Jack McCadden dead.

597
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,140
I haven't talked to Jack in couple of years.

598
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,820
Now when grifters
and cons knock each other off,

599
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,460
I really don't gice a shit.

600
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,300
But Ms. Price's father is an assemblyman,

601
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,340
and he's pushing really us
hard to fine his daughter.

602
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,820
It's how it works, he pushes me,
I push you. We find her,

603
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,260
Then I get to go home to my husband

604
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,700
who I'm pretty sure
letting our daughter overdoes

605
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,780
on pizza every night
I'm out of town.

606
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:19,020
- That sounds painfully domestic.
- To me, it's a little piece of heaven.

607
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,340
Now you make me stick around this town,

608
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,820
I'm gonna do my damndest to
just make sure that I

609
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,300
find something
to make it worthy my while.

610
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,620
For my scrapbook.

611
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,820
You know you don't have to waive
those things dry anymore.

612
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,180
It's a new process they've had it
for a couple of years now.

613
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,100
Download this, will you please.

614
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,220
- What did the cop want?
- It's nothing.

615
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,980
I'm going to need you to cover
some of my accounts for the next few weeks.

616
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,300
- Not a problem.
- Good.

617
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,700
Hey, Ray.

618
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,660
Putty, how nice to see you.

619
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,380
- Gotta go for a ride.
- Holding me up for that B and B thing?

620
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,540
That's not like you.

621
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,940
I'm hurt you'd even think such a thing.

622
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,460
- I take this is not optional?
- That's a real good way to put it.

623
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,140
So who you working for these days?

624
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,340
Guy used to run out of Salt Lake.

625
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,180
The Mormon?

626
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,380
You heard of him? Really nice guy.

627
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,180
I've heard of at least six guys who'd argue that point,

628
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,620
if they were still around.

629
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,340
E don't really keep track.

630
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,500
But me and Bobo get benefits ;
dental, eyecare...

631
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,660
- Nice uniforms?
- Nice uniforms.

632
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,580
- I remember you.
- Do you?

633
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:06,700
- I'm Adelle.
- Please to meet you.

634
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,860
And you are?

635
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,860
Too old.

636
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,460
Do you have a bathroom?

637
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,660
It's a little crowded
in here right now.

638
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:42,860
I may be married to the old creep,
but he doesn't own me.

639
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,500
Well that's good to know,

640
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,900
so where you from, young lady?

641
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:50,740
South Dakota. Tiny little town.

642
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,300
How are you enjoying life in the big city?

643
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,820
Yeah right.

644
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:02,180
It's like being in prison with a nice pool.

645
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,180
But...

646
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:09,420
I do manage to find the odd distraction.

647
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,740
Bridge?

648
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,700
Come on.
Let's do it right here.

649
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,500
- Are you insane?
- It wasn't my idea.

650
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,020
Doesn't matter who's
'idea' it was.

651
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,820
He'll tear your head off
You go near one of his wives.

652
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:37,340
You dragged me here, remember?
So, let's get this audience underway?

653
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,140
I spent a fortune for landscaping,

654
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,780
but I think it's worth it.

655
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,060
It's very beautiful.

656
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,660
Thank you.

657
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,100
Putty tells me you've met one of my wives.

658
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,940
How does that work anyway?
The two...

659
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,660
Three.

660
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,260
Congratulations.

661
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:12,140
Our Doctrine says 'Celestial marriage
is the gate to excaltation.'

662
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:17,340
Sorry, do they work in shifts
or is this more of a group effort?

663
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,780
Things manage to work themselves out.

664
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:28,380
But enough about me. Are you married?

665
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,620
No.

666
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,700
I guess I just haven't met
the right women.

667
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,900
Funny.

668
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:40,540
I've heard there's a price on the head
of your old partner Jack.

669
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,900
I've also heard he maybe in town.

670
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,540
And you want me to tell you where he is?

671
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:52,340
- You know my chosen profession, right?
- Yes.

672
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:55,900
People have been hiring hitmen
for thousands of years.

673
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:00,500
Ever since some Neanderthal
gave some other Neanderthal half a mastodon

674
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,340
to clock his brother with a rock.

675
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:06,060
Neanderthals? I would have taken you
for a creationist.

676
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,900
More of a pragmatist, really.

677
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,020
Which is where you come in.

678
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,180
Do I?

679
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:18,020
I think having a man of your skills
covering my tracks

680
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,860
would be extremely helpful.

681
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,660
Well I'm sorry
but I don't alibi crimes.

682
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,580
You alibied one.

683
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,620
For the Hatch family, wasn't it?

684
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,740
That was the first and last.

685
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,780
Oh, I think not.

686
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,900
I think from now on
there will be many, many more.

687
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:44,060
Unless becoming an accessory after the fact strikes you
as a

688
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,940
reasonable way to spend
the next ten to fifteen years of your life.

689
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:52,860
Good evening Ray, we'll be in touch.

690
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,580
The genious of Jack McCadden

691
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,420
was that he was part magician
part artist, part ghost.

692
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,020
Ray, Jack's back on the radar.

693
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,060
You guys were like Batman and Robin.

694
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,260
Although it was a previlege to
work alongside him

695
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,500
What was his name, Jack something?

696
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,340
I've gone to great pains
to leave that life behind.

697
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,140
Jack McCadden, would he know?

698
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,300
So I hear there's a price
on the head of your old partner.

699
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,140
But that's the problem with the past.

700
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,140
Bad breakup?

701
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,020
It's never really dead
until you are.

702
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,340
Dropped.

703
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,220
That's not a very comforting thought.

704
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,660
Yeah.

705
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,580
Dude, it's Cam.
I think I found Jack.

706
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,140
Cam, I can't really deal with
this right now. Something came up.

707
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,500
But if it is him
people are gonna come looking for him.

708
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,020
Hey asshole.

709
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:47,340
Ah no it's just
there's little thing that I need to deal with.

710
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,100
I will call you later.

711
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,460
Bye.

712
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:56,740
Wendell.
Wendell's posse.

713
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,300
You dick, I can't believe
you told my dad.

714
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,860
Somebody needed to straight things out.

715
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,660
I don't know who you think you are,
but you don't threaten me

716
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,820
and you don't threaten my father.

717
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:07,860
You're a fucking employee,
you understand me? you are a burtler.

718
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,980
You are a berger flipper.

719
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,420
So let's step outside
and get this party started.

720
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:24,220
What is that?
Is that sort of Kung Fu?

721
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,060
Tae Kwon Doe.

722
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,580
Oh Tae Kwon Doe.

723
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,460
Why do we do it here?
It's a little cramped in here.

724
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:39,100
If you move those two chairs.
And I will shift this table...

725
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,180
Hey!

726
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,940
That's what I'm talking about.

727
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,660
- You want some more of this, pal?
- No.

728
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,180
Wendell. I don't want to get all philosophical

729
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:51,220
but a person's life has been taken,
and someone has to account for that.

730
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,140
Do you follow me?

731
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:56,180
Please don't kill me, I'll pay you.

732
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,140
Go, go, go!

733
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,700
Come on!

734
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:06,060
Stupid, asshole.
I think you broke my fucking nose.

735
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,820
I think I did.

736
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,180
Using your intellect is nice

737
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,300
but nothing beats the thrill of
delievering a good old fashioned...

738
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,620
What's wrong with that guy?

739
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,180
Okay come on, get in.

740
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,980
Wakey, wakey.

741
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,980
Look who's up.
Look who's up.

742
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,740
I thought you were gonna sleep forever, princess.

743
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,420
I think there's been a mistake.

744
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,500
My house is that way.

745
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,220
This ain't no car service, motherfucker.
This is your worst nightmare.

746
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,060
Well, my worst nightmare has rats in it.

747
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:04,260
Well, we're gonna get to that.
Gurantee hat.

748
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,660
- I know you.
- Oh, you think so?

749
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,300
You're Hatch's driver.

750
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,140
That's right asshole and
what is that supposed to mean?

751
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,940
You think you are better than me?
You trying to put me down man?

752
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,940
What the fuck,
let me suggest something to you.

753
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:20,860
I suggest you get real smart real fast
and tell me where the fuck she is?

754
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,620
Look you better get smart.

755
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,620
Don't be annoyed but,

756
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,340
who?

757
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,980
Heather.

758
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,060
Heather Price, motherfucker.
Do you remember her now?

759
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:39,860
Little B-cup, ass like butter, right?
Mind like fucking pervert.

760
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,660
You took her to that hotel
in Santa Barbara.

761
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:44,100
Let me tell you something,
she's my fucking girlfriend, man.

762
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,180
H. It wasn't a hotel man,
it was bed and breakfast,

763
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,980
you shut the fuck up
and drive, keep attention man.

764
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:53,020
I wasn't at that hotel, I reported
my credit card stolen.

765
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,100
I spent weekend with friends
Check it out with any of them.

766
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,340
You expect somebody believe
that bullshit.

767
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,900
Is that your best shot?
It's the truth.

768
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,100
Come on, give me something before

769
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,620
I get me to engage
my suspension of disbelief

770
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,260
Give me something, man.

771
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,500
Something within the realm of Plausibility.

772
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,580
She wouldn't be cheating on me man.

773
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,140
No matter what she's done
or why she's ducking me

774
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,300
I have the capacity to forgive.

775
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:26,180
Unfortunately, tonight is not going to be
salvation to your fucking ass.

776
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,940
Do you want me to get extreme
cranial makeover on your ass.

777
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,180
Where is she?

778
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,620
Say something!

779
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:39,020
Listen, if you want to beat
information out of someone,

780
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:42,300
you gotta be
smart enough to let them answer.

781
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,180
Alright point taken,
back off man, back off.

782
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,060
Now where is she?

783
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:51,020
- Go ahead.
- She's...

784
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,500
She's dead.

785
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:59,180
- I didn't do it.
- She can't man.

786
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,820
You can kill me if you want to,
but it won't change what went down.

787
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,020
- You do it?
- No. No I didn't.

788
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,260
Do you know who fucking did it?

789
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:05,420
Wendell Hatch.

790
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:08,540
He was having an affair with her.
He came to me to help him set up an alibi.

791
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,580
No way. Can't fucking be Wendell Hatch man.

792
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,900
The man is bullshitting man.

793
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:15,180
Couldn't be a little ain't no worth.

794
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,140
Think about it, Hannibal.

795
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,580
Weren't there times when she wanted to
meet people you never met?

796
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:23,140
- What!
- Just kill him right now.

797
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:26,420
She wanted to take shower
before she was with you. She ever do that?

798
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:30,660
Jewelry! Did she have a new jewelry
a bracelet or necklace?

799
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,460
Talk to me.

800
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,780
He's fucking right.

801
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:44,060
I caught her. I caught her with big-assed diamond ear rings.

802
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,500
Shit is right man.

803
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,780
Happens more often than you think.

804
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,340
I know where he lives.

805
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,500
Remember, what about that time

806
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,580
when we went to Jino party
and I told you we seen it...

807
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,820
Don't do it, Hannibal. There's a better way.

808
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,660
Better than shooting his ass?

809
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,140
Better than you going to
jail to avenge a girl

810
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,660
who was fucking around on you.

811
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,780
Better than you throwing away

812
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:09,740
what you've got going on for a third strike
that'll get you the needle.

813
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,340
A needle motherfucker,
what do you know about me man?

814
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,500
What do you know about me
you don't know me man.

815
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:18,380
The ink says you've been inside.

816
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:21,740
And I know you drive for Hatch
to pay for your tuition fees.

817
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,820
- You promise he goes down?
- I can make it happen.

818
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,020
Better make it happen.
If he walks,

819
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,620
I'm gonna finish it in my way.
You follow me?

820
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:32,100
You've made yourself very clear.

821
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,140
So I wanted to.

822
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,180
I said you made yourself very clear.

823
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:42,940
- Almost kept my first one in there.
- Told you there were rats, mother fucker.

824
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:46,860
Excuse me.

825
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,420
Hello?

826
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:54,460
Ray, my friend. Is this a bad time?

827
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,420
It is a very bad time.

828
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,980
Can you come by?

829
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:02,700
I was hoping we could firm up
some dates for our business.

830
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,100
I can't tonight.

831
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,620
I've got...
I've got laundry.

832
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,140
Tomorrow then.

833
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:16,980
Oh, by the way, a gentleman contacted me
regarding you this afternoon.

834
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,780
- What did he want?
- He wanted me to take you out.

835
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,540
I'm pretty sure I'm not your type.

836
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:26,180
It wasn't some sodomite tea party, Ray.

837
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,620
What did you say?

838
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:35,900
I said it was out of the question
as we have unfinished business, you and I.

839
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,380
What did he offer you?

840
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,460
A man should always know his worth.

841
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,340
Your asking price is twenty three thousand.

842
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,220
Tell Hatch you'll take it.

843
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:53,420
Very impressive.
But suicide is still a sin Ray.

844
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,700
If you take the constract at least
I know he won't be hiring anyone else.

845
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,780
You know,
if I had Jack McCadden's whereabouts,

846
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,500
you and I might never
need to speak again.

847
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:04,540
Five million dollars buys
a lot of forgiveness.

848
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,540
I'll see you tomorrow.

849
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,900
Shit.

850
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:37,180
Lucky for you I didn't make
any other plans tonight.

851
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:40,220
What happened?

852
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,820
Opera?

853
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,620
What happened?

854
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,780
I was car jacked.

855
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,100
Doubtful.

856
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,460
Care to try again?

857
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,660
It was Hatch's driver.

858
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,420
Why would he come after you?

859
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,500
It's better if you don't know.

860
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,540
I think I can decide
what I can handle.

861
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,340
Well?

862
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,260
It was Hatch's son.

863
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:28,060
He spent last weekend in Santa Barbara
where he killed his date.

864
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:32,220
And I...we were on the job.

865
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:36,540
I got that guy Putty
to take care of it.

866
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,260
And now the cops are all over me

867
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:42,380
and a very bad man has been hired to kill me.

868
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,180
You sure this job is worth it?

869
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,580
It's not normally this bad.

870
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:54,340
You ever consider asking
your old partner for help?

871
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:59,820
- It's not so easy.
- Why?

872
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,660
Because you are Jack McCadden?

873
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,260
It makes a certain amount of sense.

874
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:11,260
What that guy putty said,
your trip to San Francisco.

875
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:14,220
How much it must have
cost to set up your company.

876
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,020
Plus you calling Jack your boss

877
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:20,380
when I really can't see you
ever working for anyone.

878
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,620
A woman can tell when a man lies, Ray

879
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:27,540
If she's paying attention and
if she really wants to know.

880
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:32,140
And if I can figure it out
I might not be the only one.

881
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,460
It's funny.

882
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,820
You think I'm Jack,

883
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,740
the detective thinks I killed Jack

884
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:43,460
and the Mormon thinks
I know where Jack is hiding out.

885
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,500
So who's right?

886
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:52,100
I know you won't believe me Ray,
but not everyone is working an angle.

887
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,580
Well...

888
00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:02,540
That maybe. But for five million dollars,
somebody might take a chance.

889
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,780
Then I suppose you have a choice to make.

890
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:10,220
I suppose I do.

891
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:24,140
You look like a man with a problem.

892
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:26,740
Several.

893
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:29,180
Care to add to the burden?

894
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:36,020
I need an alibi for Thursday night.
Something extremely sturdy.

895
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,700
Well the only absolutely air-tight alibi...

896
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,620
is death.

897
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,620
What's happening Thursday night?

898
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,460
Let me explain something.

899
00:52:56,580 --> 00:53:01,220
It helps if I know where you are going to be,
so I can pretend you're somewhere else.

900
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,620
Honey?

901
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:13,140
Fine. I'll be at the Ellroy Hotel.

902
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,420
But that's all you get.

903
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:19,780
And where would you want to pretend to be?

904
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,860
Does it matter?

905
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:23,580
It's your neck.

906
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,700
Thank you, Adelle.

907
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,780
How about this?

908
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:42,020
How about if I write you a check right now
and you forget we ever met?

909
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:48,820
Do you have five million
in your checking account?

910
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:53,700
Unless you're trying to tell me Jack
is already a non-issue?

911
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,900
You wouldn't have me waste my time
looking for a man

912
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:58,500
who's already passed on to the

913
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,060
greater celestial court,

914
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:03,900
would you?

915
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:07,580
Anything else, Ray?

916
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,740
Not right now. No.

917
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:27,940
So...
is this a social call?

918
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,700
Business, actually.

919
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,740
I've heard you want my boss dead.

920
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:35,740
- Excuse me?
- Please, Mr. Hatch. I'm on a deadline.

921
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:40,100
- I kind of thought that you and Ray were maybe...
- You thought wrong.

922
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,180
Can I ask why?

923
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,020
No.

924
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:50,300
Now, your only problem is,

925
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:54,700
the man who you approached to get the job done
is now working with Ray.

926
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,780
You understand there's a difference

927
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:01,700
between wanting someone dead
and doing something about it?

928
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:07,180
And here I thought you were the proactive,
captain of industry type.

929
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:11,380
My mistake. I won't waste your time.

930
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,900
Okay. Okay.

931
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,900
So let's say...

932
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:21,060
hypothetically, that
I was remotely interested in this thing you're...

933
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:23,460
Then let's say, hypothetically,

934
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,980
you meet me here on
Friday with $100,000 cash.

935
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:31,540
And should I bring something else?

936
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,340
Your appetite.

937
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,780
Come in.

938
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,060
So it's not a problem?

939
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:47,540
- For you, sweetie, nothing's a problem.
- Good.

940
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:51,580
- How are things with you and Ted?
- I don't know.

941
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,820
Maybe I should have tried it harder.

942
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:57,900
There's no rule that says you can't
make up with your husband.

943
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,980
If you still love him.

944
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,980
Wow.

945
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,660
Did Ray Elliott actually just use
the 'L' word without smirking?

946
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,380
I'm just saying...

947
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,540
Oh my god.
Ray's got a girlfriend.

948
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:17,460
To be honest with you, Dorothy,

949
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:21,100
- I'm not sure what I've got.
- Oh sure you do.

950
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:28,100
- Ray.
- How's it going?

951
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,500
Pretty much as expected.

952
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:31,860
Let's get rolling.

953
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:35,220
Alright ladies, it's on.

954
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:39,340
Yes, Mr Sykes.
That's right.

955
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:42,500
Ray would consider it a personal favor.

956
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:45,660
- Wendell Hatch?
- Yes

957
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,380
I'm Detective Sykes, this is Detective Holbrook.

958
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,340
We'd like you to come down to the station
and answer a few questions.

959
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:54,100
How well do you know Ray Elliott?

960
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,500
He's involved in a missing person's case
we're working.

961
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,820
- He is?
- What did he just say?

962
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:01,020
Young lady named Heather Price.

963
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:04,740
We believe Mr. Elliott took her to
a bed and breakfast last weekend.

964
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,660
She hasn't been heard from since.

965
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:10,020
Mr, Elliott took her to a bed and breakfast?

966
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:13,780
What do I always tell you about mumbling?
No one can hear you.

967
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:17,780
Seems like He's been spinning some tail
to the Santa Barbara police department

968
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,420
about how his credit card was stolen...

969
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:23,420
but we're pretty sure he killed her.

970
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:25,260
Thank you.

971
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,940
You know anything about it.

972
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:29,020
Why would you think that I would?

973
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:31,580
One of our officers saw you
talking to Mr. Elliott

974
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,500
And he says there was
an altercation at the bar.

975
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:40,220
I don't, I don't really know him.
He, I think he works with my dad sometimes

976
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:44,380
and I, I was in this bar and he was
he was drunk, really drunk,

977
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,380
Were there words exchanged?

978
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:50,940
- Words?
- Yeah words.

979
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,260
You know those things
you used to form sentences.

980
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,460
Only this time in a hostile context.

981
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:59,220
Yeah there were words,
but there were just...

982
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,540
Hey you jerk...

983
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:02,780
You know so it wasn't anything

984
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,940
but he did hit me out of nowhere,
just swung at me.

985
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:09,100
We never talked about
any missing...dead girl.

986
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:13,820
That's what your question was.

987
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:17,180
Okay. Okay.

988
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,580
Thanks for clearing that up, Mr. Hatch.

989
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:22,700
I hope you find this guy
cause that's terrible.

990
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:26,620
Hey you know what?
We always get the bad guy.

991
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:29,140
As a matter of fact, the owner of
the bed and breakfast coming in

992
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,940
and take a look at some pictures.

993
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,140
Have you been to this place?
Shady Grove in Santa Barbara.

994
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,660
No I, I haven't been.

995
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:36,820
Hey! Hey!

996
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:38,260
It's just routine, Mr. Hatch.

997
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:40,580
We want to mix in some photos with Mr. Elliott's,

998
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:43,460
You know, give the guy
some faces to choose from.

999
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,180
I mean, don't you have to ask my permission
before you do that?

1000
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:48,700
- You don't mind, do you?
- He's not going to pick you out, so

1001
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:50,940
- what's the harm?
- No it's just...fuck.

1002
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,260
Detectives!

1003
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:54,340
Will you excuse us for a minute?

1004
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,900
Ellroy Hotel.

1005
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,780
Sorry about that.

1006
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:11,340
- So what were you saying?
- Nothing. I...just remembered. I have a thing...

1007
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,540
- Thanks for coming in by the way.
- Sure.

1008
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:24,100
Something like that?

1009
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:28,300
I think you've earned yourself
a store credit

1010
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:30,700
It's Shady Grove

1011
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:33,380
- Matthew Klump please.
-Speaking.

1012
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:37,700
Mr Klump. Congratulations.
Today is your Lucky day.

1013
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:41,940
You've just one a night of total luxury
in beautiful Los Angeles.

1014
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:45,020
All for being a loyal subscriber to B and B magazine,

1015
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,820
yes, we'd remove
all the outstanding items

1016
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:48,940
from your bill plus
we'll give you a small credit.

1017
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:50,180
You got it.

1018
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:52,220
And those would be red roses?

1019
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:55,180
- Yes I'd like one dozen.
- Okay, no problem.

1020
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,300
Right, so deliever the envelope
to the front desk of Ellroy Hotel?

1021
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:59,580
That's right.

1022
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:07,740
Adelle, these flowers are a pale
comparison to you, love Bob.

1023
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:10,220
Who's Bob?

1024
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:14,540
Bob's the man who make the mistake of sending
my wife flowers.

1025
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:17,060
Don't let her out of your sight.

1026
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,780
Where you going?

1027
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,420
Dressing room.

1028
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:41,660
Unless you boys want me
to strip right here?

1029
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:52,140
Was wondering when you'd show up.

1030
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:55,980
- Oh, Ray. I could just eat you up.
- Hold that thought.

1031
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:58,660
You like your gift certificate?

1032
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:03,940
That was from you?

1033
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:09,220
- Ray, you're gonna spoil me.
- You know I think I am.

1034
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:14,380
Now can you come to the Ellroy Hotel
at six-fifteen PM?

1035
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,580
I've got us a room.

1036
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:21,100
I'll have no miss choir practice.

1037
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,260
I can write you a note?

1038
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:30,140
Okay, maybe I'm no Casanova.

1039
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,580
And maybe I'm in way over my head.

1040
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:38,060
But this was always Jack's job
I was the pencil pusher. The statistical expert.

1041
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:42,380
Unfortunately, being able to tell you
that seven and ten murders of crimes of passion or

1042
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,580
three and four hitmen are hired by one spouse

1043
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:48,340
to kill the other isn't
terrily relevant information.

1044
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:51,780
Unless of course you are the one
they are hired to kill.

1045
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:56,220
Jack was right,
I should never have gone straight.

1046
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:04,900
I need a piece.

1047
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,140
A piece of what?

1048
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:09,620
You know a gun.

1049
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,740
Oh why do you say that Snoop Dog?

1050
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:14,020
Let me show you what we've got.

1051
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:18,260
Ever get the feeling you're
running out of leads?

1052
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:20,540
- This is Walsh.
- I'm a happily married mother of two

1053
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,140
and this guy stand my fucking left breast...

1054
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:24,580
Think we might have something.

1055
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:26,780
This guy I have watching
Hannibal picked up something

1056
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:28,820
going down this afternoon
at the Ellroy Hotel.

1057
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:30,140
How good is your guy?

1058
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,380
Good enough to supply a room number.
Worth a look, right?

1059
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:33,900
Great. Let's go.

1060
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,340
- Ray.
- Your boy's here.

1061
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,860
Any sign of Wendell?

1062
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:51,060
Are you sure this is gonna work out?

1063
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:55,380
Low ranks circus?
Where did you get that clown from?

1064
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:59,700
- I'm off to church.
- Shit.

1065
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:01,700
Ma'am, could you hang on
for a minuite?

1066
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:03,620
You clear it with the boss?

1067
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:06,620
I go every Thursday,

1068
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:10,300
but you can check with
the choir master if you want to.

1069
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:14,260
We got that thing, anyway. Remember?

1070
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:15,900
Don't be late.

1071
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:30,300
To new partners.

1072
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:32,500
To the late, great Ray Elliott.

1073
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:36,900
That is why, if we stay cool,
things are going to be just...

1074
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:41,780
What tells you to
tell me stay cool. I am cool alright?

1075
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,060
Little piece of shit just arrived.

1076
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:59,060
God Damn it. He's bailing.
I told you he's gonna bail.

1077
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:00,020
Tell me what's happening.

1078
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:03,380
He just left. Look we did it your way
I'm gonna try my way. How about that?

1079
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,340
We have to stay to the plan.
Otherwise, people are going to get seriously hurt.

1080
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,180
And Wendell will walk.

1081
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:09,980
- Just get him in inside.
- Yeah whatever.

1082
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:12,380
I must get him killed.

1083
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:15,260
Hey Holmes!

1084
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:17,660
- Park my car right there.
- Thanks.

1085
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:25,820
Alright he's inside.

1086
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:29,660
So I brought what you told me to bring.

1087
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:32,700
I like a man who takes direction.

1088
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:36,580
Why don't we go up to your room and talk?

1089
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:07,820
My grandfather's staying here.

1090
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:10,140
And what's your grandfather's name?

1091
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:12,820
Oh, Klump.

1092
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,420
Yes, sir. He just checked in.

1093
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:21,820
I will just...
Thank you.

1094
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:24,220
Sir?

1095
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:27,580
It's room 1015.

1096
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:30,820
1015?

1097
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:40,540
Mr Klump? What are you doing here?

1098
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:43,500
I won a contest.

1099
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:56,620
Welcome to the Ellroy Hotel.
May I help you?

1100
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:58,740
Yes. There should be an envelope for me.

1101
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:00,660
My name's McGillicutty.

1102
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:05,740
Here you are.

1103
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:14,380
Mr Klump.
This is very important.

1104
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:18,020
Exactly what kind of contest did you win?

1105
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:20,580
A magazine kind?

1106
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:30,180
- Drink?
- Is that all you're offering?

1107
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,980
Let's get the business out of the way first.

1108
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:37,100
You're sure you still want to get rid of Ray?

1109
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:40,460
I'm not a man prone to second thought.

1110
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:43,340
- And you haven't found anyone else?
- No.

1111
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:44,980
Good.

1112
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,660
How do I know you're for real?

1113
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:51,020
You'll never know for sure,

1114
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:55,700
but I promise you won't be dissapointed.

1115
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:19,220
Adelle!

1116
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:23,140
You son of a bitch!

1117
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:26,660
- Take care and keep an eye on.
- Sir!

1118
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:41,740
Whoever you are
somebody really want you dead.

1119
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:46,540
Now I don't know about you, Bobby,
but I'm feeling pretty dirty.

1120
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:48,380
Can't I watch?

1121
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:03,900
- Ray?
- Hey. Was starting to worry about you. Where you been?

1122
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:07,740
Just covering our accounts, as instructed.

1123
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:12,700
So I think I need to tell you something.
I'm actually a huge opera fan.

1124
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:15,420
That's what you needed to tell me?

1125
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:19,340
But I always preferred Carmen to Salome.
You know why?

1126
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:23,580
Because in Salome the hero loses his head

1127
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:26,620
and in Carmen the evil temptress
is made to pay with her life?

1128
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:30,460
Oh no. Actually, it's the overture.

1129
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:33,900
Hey Lola, Are you okay?

1130
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:38,140
Yeah I'm ready.

1131
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,460
God Damn!

1132
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,340
Excuse me sir.

1133
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,740
- Ice for Champagne?
- Oh forget the ice.

1134
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:02,660
Why don't you get in the tub with me?

1135
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:05,940
I know these things that
we can do with the water jets

1136
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:08,540
- I tell you what...
- Trust me when I'm done with you

1137
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:10,940
You're going to need ice.

1138
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:13,420
Can I help you?

1139
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:16,100
I'm looking for Ray
I mean Bob.

1140
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:17,660
He's a guest here.

1141
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:20,420
- Are you Adelle?
- Yes.

1142
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:22,340
Room 1215.

1143
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:24,460
Thank you.

1144
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:46,900
I've learned not to rely on
a single person in this world.

1145
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:48,220
And I'm not.

1146
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:50,340
I'm relying on a dozen.

1147
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:53,700
Mostly cheats, killers and cons.

1148
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,180
And I happen to trust these people.

1149
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:00,740
Or at least trust on their baser instincts.

1150
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,300
Let's hope they don't disappoint me.

1151
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:15,740
Nice shoes.

1152
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:18,460
Thank you.

1153
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:22,500
Oh fuck!

1154
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,220
I got a paper cut.

1155
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:28,420
Boss, you better down.

1156
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,660
But the most important thing
I learned from Jack,

1157
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:35,140
within the face of real danger,

1158
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:38,380
make certain that
you are never ever around

1159
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:54,420
I don't like this.

1160
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:56,420
Mr Klump I think we need to
get you out of here.

1161
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:57,780
Hell no!

1162
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,900
This is Detective Walsh.
Officer needs assistance,

1163
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:01,980
we're at the Ellroy Hotel,
room 1015.

1164
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:04,020
I swear it was her.

1165
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:06,980
I'm gonna kill him.

1166
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:11,460
Then I'll pray for God to resurrect him
so I can kill him again.

1167
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:16,740
Ray. Where are you?

1168
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:17,900
Ray?

1169
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:20,580
- Front desk.
- You have a Robert in the hotel?

1170
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:23,580
- I'm sorry?
- A Robert. A Bob...

1171
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:24,620
What's the last name?

1172
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:25,980
I don't know
Just tell me.

1173
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:29,500
If there are any Roberts or
God damned Bobs in the hotel

1174
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,780
or I will come down there and
personally shove that phone...

1175
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:35,380
I have a first initial 'R'

1176
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:39,500
- Yeah?
- R. Elliott. Room 1215.

1177
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:45,980
Sir? Hello?
Hello?

1178
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:52,540
So...you never thought
it would come down to this.

1179
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:55,980
You try to cover all the basis
do your homework.

1180
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:57,620
At the end of the day

1181
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,780
It's the people you trust.

1182
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:04,420
I'm not a huge proponent of that word.

1183
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:08,460
I prefer leverage to human nature any day.

1184
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,420
Sometimes, you just have to roll the dice...

1185
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:21,180
Come on in, the water's fine.

1186
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:26,300
- I ask you a question.
- Shoot.

1187
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:29,860
Making a speech.

1188
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:31,460
You almost done?

1189
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:41,740
Room service!

1190
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:51,700
It's open.

1191
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:00,540
Oh my god.

1192
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:02,460
You friend of Lola's?

1193
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:12,060
Oh shit.

1194
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:34,180
Listen. Please. I swear to God
I've never seen this woman before in my life.

1195
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:36,220
My name is Robert Hatch...

1196
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:38,300
- Bob Hatch?
- If you prefer.

1197
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,740
You see any flowers
for my wife down there.

1198
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:46,980
What's going on here?

1199
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:49,220
To be honest, I'm not quite sure.

1200
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:53,460
Hey. That's him. That's the guy
you were asking about.

1201
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:55,380
I've never seen this old guy
before in my life.

1202
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:58,620
- He's lying!
- What are you doing in his room with a gun?

1203
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:01,220
- Hey boss!
- What?

1204
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,940
It's six thirteen.

1205
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:07,780
God bless it. Give me the envelope.

1206
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:17,940
Don't kill him until I get back.

1207
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:33,260
Suppose we will...

1208
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:14,300
Contest will be just fine...

1209
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,380
Step back into your suite.

1210
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:29,860
Come on.

1211
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:39,740
I don't know you
but you don't look that stupid.

1212
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:58,020
House keeping.

1213
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,340
Hello?

1214
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:09,940
This is dispatch, I need two uniforms

1215
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:11,580
to room fifteen-seventeen.

1216
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:15,700
Maid reports an immobile Caucasian male.
Possible shooting victim.

1217
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:16,940
Roger that.

1218
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:19,460
Victim with several gun shot wounds
to the chest

1219
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:20,700
Roger.

1220
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:23,580
We have a positive ID on the shooting victim.

1221
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:26,340
Victim identified as Jack McCadden.

1222
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:34,780
- Lola!
- Here, it's yours.

1223
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:36,500
Lola!

1224
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:37,700
What the hell was wrong with
the other fifteen bodies that I showed you?

1225
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:41,860
I just wanted to make sure
it was a good match.

1226
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:46,060
You just couldn't stand the idea of
You not leaving a good looking corpse.

1227
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:49,060
Vatiny's gonna be the death of you, Ray.

1228
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:51,060
Let's hope.

1229
01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:59,140
That should cover the cops
and any incidentals?

1230
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:00,740
And then some.

1231
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:08,780
Hey Cam!
Put him somewhere nice.

1232
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:13,580
It's not every day you get to bury yourself.

1233
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:20,300
What are you gonna do with the money?

1234
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:23,300
Assuming the Sultan actually pays what he says?

1235
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:26,820
I don't know.
Five million's a lot of cash,

1236
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:29,620
but I am a river to my people.

1237
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:32,780
Enough warmed over Lawrence of Arabia, Sudhir.

1238
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:34,140
You're from the Boston.

1239
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:36,420
Where I have people.

1240
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:38,620
Goodbye, Jack McCadden.

1241
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:40,540
May I rest in peace?

1242
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:44,180
Here's a new spin.

1243
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:46,460
If one in four men cheats on their wives

1244
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:49,380
Then three in four are faithful

1245
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:52,340
And even more admirable
nine in ten women.

1246
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:54,540
Not bad odds to play.

1247
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:59,340
So no more Jack
no more Alibis, no more worries.

1248
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:02,020
Just the thought of waking up
every morning and hearing...

1249
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:04,540
You are such an asshole.

1250
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:09,500
Sometimes it helps
if you don't know the whole story.

1251
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:13,220
In business. Not relationships.

1252
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:19,180
I want you to be part of
my new life, not my old one.

1253
01:20:20,260 --> 01:20:21,860
So where should we go?

1254
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:24,260
It's up to you.

1255
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:28,780
You said you've already been to the Holy land

1256
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:32,700
I also mentioned not everyone
is working an angle.

1257
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:34,060
Noted.

1258
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:37,900
I think we should try the full
discloser thing, see how it goes.

1259
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:41,260
I'm not sure about Asia. How's London.

1260
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:42,820
Not a good idea, at the moment.

1261
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:45,660
- Caribbean?
- Some minor, unfinished litigation.

1262
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:49,380
- Paris?
- Yes. Actually no.

1263
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:52,940
- Amsterdam? Greenland?
- Come here.

1264
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:07,820
I just realized you are
quite a bit taller than me.
