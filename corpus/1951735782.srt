00:00:06,304 --> 00:00:11,063
"Dozens of years ago,
in a nearby galaxy..."

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,344
"A really long time ago..."

00:00:22,478 --> 00:00:25,039
GEORGE LUCAS IN LOVE

6
00:00:34,408 --> 00:00:36,161
I can feel it, man.

7
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:38,609
It's like this giant...

8
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:41,327
...cosmic force,
an energy field...

9
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:44,255
...created by all living things.

10
00:00:44,455 --> 00:00:47,097
- It surround us, it penetrates us...
- Benji, I'm trying to write.

11
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:50,213
If I don't finish this script in 3 days,
I don't graduate.

12
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,171
You're lost man...

13
00:00:51,382 --> 00:00:55,378
You know, my mom is coming this weekend,
so could you clean up the "farmacy"?

14
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:07,274
So Lucas, we meet again.

15
00:01:07,795 --> 00:01:10,675
Aaron, you live next door.

16
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:16,361
My script is now complete.

17
00:01:18,284 --> 00:01:22,884
Soon I will rule the industry
and you will still be writing line one of...

18
00:01:23,088 --> 00:01:24,158
...whatever it's called.

19
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:26,326
"3XR-259.7"

20
00:01:26,691 --> 00:01:28,091
Exactly.

21
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:30,573
And George, the beard...

22
00:01:31,575 --> 00:01:33,009
...not working for you.

23
00:01:38,981 --> 00:01:40,860
O shit, I'm gotta meet my profesor!

24
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,552
Chuck, are you OK?

25
00:01:54,794 --> 00:01:55,830
Hey, check around, kid.

26
00:01:56,035 --> 00:01:57,595
She is the fastest
thing on campus.

27
00:01:57,797 --> 00:01:58,913
Yeah, maybe later, Hal.

28
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:09,683
They are coming for us all!

29
00:02:10,327 --> 00:02:11,522
Beware...

30
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:14,164
...of the Dark Side, the...
evil empire!

31
00:02:15,491 --> 00:02:18,247
Yes, I thought it was
quite rude as well.

32
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,855
So, yeah, ah...

33
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:26,690
...it's not what you would call 
technically, done, yet...

34
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:32,543
...but it's about a
young space farmer...

35
00:02:33,426 --> 00:02:36,820
..who is... he's struggling with a...

36
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,150
...with a terrible crop...

37
00:02:40,552 --> 00:02:43,068
...of space wheat.

38
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:47,713
Hm, struggle!

39
00:02:53,843 --> 00:02:55,881
- Yeah, and, he's also, he's searching...
- No!

40
00:02:56,246 --> 00:02:58,044
Search not.

41
00:02:58,247 --> 00:03:01,083
Inspiracion will you not find.

42
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:05,731
It will find you.

43
00:03:09,896 --> 00:03:12,891
Could you talk forward?

44
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:14,819
Too much already have I said.

45
00:03:19,425 --> 00:03:20,336
OK, thank you...

46
00:03:20,545 --> 00:03:23,186
You've been a big... help.

47
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:30,022
Space wheat, space corn...

48
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,114
Space oats?

49
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,963
You're beautiful!

50
00:03:53,453 --> 00:03:56,253
I'm sorry, I don't normaly
talk to girls like that...

51
00:03:56,455 --> 00:03:59,575
..I don't normally talk to girls.
So, yeah, I'm sorry.

52
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:03,858
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't
know anybody was in here.

53
00:04:04,182 --> 00:04:06,459
I usually just like to come here to think.

54
00:04:07,145 --> 00:04:07,975
You do?

55
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:11,336
I mean... I'll leave.

56
00:04:11,588 --> 00:04:12,738
Wait.

57
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,581
You are George Lucas, right?

58
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:24,071
I'm Marion.
I loved your student films.

59
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,160
"1.42.08", "6.18.67"...

60
00:04:28,763 --> 00:04:30,276
...great titles.

61
00:04:31,324 --> 00:04:32,839
I can't believe you saw them.

62
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:37,805
Yeah. They had such pasion,
such vision.

63
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:41,525
I loved them.

64
00:04:44,656 --> 00:04:46,295
Do you wanna to sit down?

65
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,774
I'm just beginning to think that
space oats isn't the answer.

66
00:04:55,465 --> 00:04:59,939
Maybe you just weren't meant to write
agricultural space tragedies.

67
00:05:00,869 --> 00:05:05,503
You've got to write from you heart,
just let people onto your dreams.

68
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:07,343
You think so?

69
00:05:09,636 --> 00:05:10,592
I do.

70
00:05:11,238 --> 00:05:12,752
I really do.

71
00:05:17,363 --> 00:05:19,639
Oh, damn, you know, I've gotta go.
There is a big protest...

72
00:05:19,845 --> 00:05:22,361
...I'm kind of leading a student rebellion.

73
00:05:23,688 --> 00:05:24,678
Will I see you again?

74
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,723
Definitely.

75
00:05:27,852 --> 00:05:29,445
Don't worry so much.

76
00:05:33,496 --> 00:05:35,215
Just write what you know.

77
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,753
Just like "bull's eye Womp rats"...

78
00:06:16,612 --> 00:06:17,728
Ah, my hand!

79
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:35,787
It's amazing.

80
00:06:35,988 --> 00:06:37,627
You are amazing.

81
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:39,747
You are my inspiration.

82
00:06:41,312 --> 00:06:44,227
I feel... like we are so connected...

83
00:06:44,835 --> 00:06:46,031
Me too.

84
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:57,715
Mom?

85
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:00,148
Mom?!?

86
00:07:01,048 --> 00:07:03,200
Hi, kids.

87
00:07:15,821 --> 00:07:17,050
Hey, George!

88
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,493
Check out my new duck.

89
00:07:19,224 --> 00:07:20,499
I named him Howard.
