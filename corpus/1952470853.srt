1
00:00:38,518 --> 00:00:41,817
1864, Aprll 22nd.

2
00:00:41,888 --> 00:00:45,790
I remember that day
llke It was yesterday.

3
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:48,487
A renegade troop
of Northern soldlers

4
00:00:48,562 --> 00:00:51,224
fought In the so called
Clvll War,

5
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:55,797
raped our women,
murdered our chlldren,

6
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:58,201
even took out
my goddamn eyel

7
00:00:58,271 --> 00:01:00,102
I can stlll hear
Granny's crles

8
00:01:00,173 --> 00:01:03,574
as they burnt Pleasant
Valley to the ground.

9
00:01:05,779 --> 00:01:07,474
They kllled us all,

10
00:01:07,547 --> 00:01:10,482
doomed us
to a llfe In llmbo.

11
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:16,147
Nothlng more
than ghosts seeklng revenge.

12
00:01:16,223 --> 00:01:19,215
Guess that's the way
the good Lord wants It.

13
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:20,987
Eye for eye, tooth for tooth,

14
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:23,029
as the Old Testament says.

15
00:01:23,096 --> 00:01:25,929
One thlng's for certaln,

16
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:29,196
our souls aln't
ever gonna flnd rest

17
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:33,262
'tll all 2001 are avenged I

18
00:01:58,331 --> 00:02:02,597
Yes, slr, name's Buckman.
Mayor James W. Buckman.

19
00:02:02,669 --> 00:02:04,227
And here In Pleasant Valley,

20
00:02:04,304 --> 00:02:07,967
the annlversary of our
traglc massacre has arrlved.

21
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:11,010
And so have we.

22
00:02:11,077 --> 00:02:13,409
Knlves have been
sharpened for justlce,

23
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,348
table set for revenge.

24
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:20,580
We try to make sport of It
for the llttle ones.

25
00:02:20,654 --> 00:02:25,057
No reason vengeance
can't be fun.

26
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:28,322
Only thlng mlsslng
are the Yanks.

27
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:31,660
And so, yet agaln,

28
00:02:31,731 --> 00:02:33,130
we walt.

29
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,676
M ust admlt Granny's been
deeply loyal through the decades.

30
00:02:43,743 --> 00:02:46,644
J ust aln't Into rubblng
ankles wlth her no more.

31
00:02:46,713 --> 00:02:49,511
Last tlme we dld,
I popped my son.

32
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:50,948
Fllthy scum.

33
00:02:51,017 --> 00:02:53,577
I think that's
them coming now.

34
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:56,019
What in the blazes-?

35
00:02:56,089 --> 00:02:57,716
Yee-haw I

36
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,281

# Yeah I #

45
00:03:27,254 --> 00:03:28,881
Damn!

46
00:03:28,955 --> 00:03:32,550
What seems to be the problem
here, my good Sheriff Freeman?

47
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:36,562
The problem, my good man, is every
spring I get calls from State police

48
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,657
after your's llttle festlval,
looklng for mlsslng Northern folk.

49
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:42,964
U p 'tll now, I've played
ball wlth ya'll,

50
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:45,334
but now I've got Ben
sniffing around my butt.

51
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:49,501
"You've played ball, " because we've
paid you quite a generous bounty

52
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:54,172
for your stewardship, ain't
that right, sweet cream?

53
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:58,445
You dldn't mlnd me when you was
a cub scout, dld you llttle Davy?

54
00:03:58,518 --> 00:03:59,849
No, ma'am.

55
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,514
You wouldn't be pretending
you can resist me?

56
00:04:02,589 --> 00:04:03,851
No, ma'am.

57
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:05,789
That's what I thought.

58
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:10,694
Look, milk or no milk, I ain't dropping
the soap in prison for none of ya'.

59
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:13,232
Ain't gonna be

00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,736
No more feastln',
no more klllln'.

61
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:19,135
None of it!
Is that clear?

62
00:04:19,205 --> 00:04:22,106
Clear as
a nighttime kiss,

63
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:25,872
on a young
possum's cooch.

64
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:32,874
This town used to be a jeweI
on the crown of the South.

65
00:04:32,953 --> 00:04:35,513
You maniacs squeezed it into a turd.

66
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:38,752
Now hush up, you big baby,
you're ruining all the fun.

67
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:43,785
Amen, Harper. Such Ingratltude
brlngs a tear to my eye

68
00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:47,458
when I think of all the hard work
that went into making this thrill ride.

69
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:48,592
Am I

70
00:04:48,668 --> 00:04:49,760
Yeah!

71
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:51,565
Damn you

00:04:51,638 --> 00:04:56,041
Well if that's how you feeI I'll
have to tickle you on the way down.

Hold on.

76
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:07,276
We'll make a deaI.

77
00:05:07,354 --> 00:05:08,981

78
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:11,387
No deaI? No.

79
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,858
Fuck you and your maniacs!

80
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:15,019
Wait, wait a minute.

00:05:15,095 --> 00:05:16,119
Bye-bye.

00:05:16,196 --> 00:05:17,288
No. No!

83
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:20,162
Okay, folks,

We're already there.

98
00:06:12,285 --> 00:06:14,378
Ugh!

99
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,660
# Rot in hell

00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:34,507
Ah, well, Bucky,

won't come to the South-

102

Well, we'll bring

00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:15,532
I hear they have these bugs there,
called chiggers, that sleep in your puss.

113
00:09:15,602 --> 00:09:18,503
Those Mexican cleaning ladies

114
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:21,369
My sister has got to
ditch that icky dead dog,

but then Rome got it taxidermed.

I cannot stand my
sister's boyfriend, Falcon.

117
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:30,449
He's so gay. Hello?

married or anything, so.

120
00:09:38,758 --> 00:09:41,784
Yo, yo, yo, what plays in
Georgia, stays in Georgia.

I mean, why not Pulltzer, or the Nobel?

132

Why do you have to be

140
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:37,542
I'm not the one smacklng

141
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:38,948
Tina.

142
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:40,383

143
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:42,284
Stop bagging

144
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:48,055
Ow! I mean, K, can't you show
Biscuit just a little respect?

145
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:53,326
Bro, who's on the fucklng

146
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,199
Look, dude. I kiss her

Fucking cheapskates put some damn

Where the fuck

150
00:11:15,388 --> 00:11:17,583
I shouldn't have

151
00:11:17,657 --> 00:11:21,388
Will you get off

152
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:23,486
How many times
do I have to tell you?

153
00:11:23,563 --> 00:11:26,896
Momma wants a hard shell taco when
all you got is a soggy chlngadera.

154
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:28,695
Shut up, baby.

00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:34,892
Yeah, llke maklng me wear
pantles to the Saturn A wards,

173
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:37,128
or not letting Rome shave her head.

174
00:12:37,203 --> 00:12:40,969
Girls, girls, it's not
about wearing panties

175
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,441
or shaving
your puss- Head,

176
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:49,413
It's about not lettlng these
parasltlc boyfrlends drag you down.

177
00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:53,248
You gotta evolve
into modern women.

178
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:55,685
More like modern
rug munchers.

179
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:58,781
Shit- U h-

180
00:12:58,858 --> 00:13:02,726
U h, uh, Madre de Dlosl Madre de Dlosl

181
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:04,194
Damn I

182
00:13:04,263 --> 00:13:06,254
What happened?

183
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:13,935
Get off of mel

184
00:13:16,075 --> 00:13:18,066
What the fuck
is wrong with you, Jezus?

185
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:21,443
It's "Jesus", puta, and I
hit a fucking detour sign.

186
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:22,776
I n the middle
of the road?

187
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:24,043
Yeah.

188
00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:25,982
How much is this
gonna cost me, Jesus?

189
00:13:26,052 --> 00:13:29,920
Knowing your cheap ass, you probably
didn't even insure this piece of shit,

190
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:31,923
so I just made you
some money, bruja.

191
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:36,291
Look, they spelled it
the French way.

192
00:13:36,362 --> 00:13:37,886
Where the fuck
are we anyway?

193
00:13:37,964 --> 00:13:39,898
Iowa.

194
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:42,526
How the fuck
did we get to Iowa?

195
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:44,695
Sorry, I was a little bit distracted.

196
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:49,565
Hey, we could
always camp out.

197
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:52,406
You know, get the glrls In thongs,

198
00:13:52,478 --> 00:13:55,038
roasting marshmallows,

199
00:13:55,114 --> 00:13:57,207
It would make
for some great footage.

200
00:13:57,283 --> 00:14:00,582
H m, I don't thlnk so. Thls
place looks way too creepy.

201
00:14:00,653 --> 00:14:03,178
Yeah, It makes
Blscult's halr stand up.

202
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:05,656
That would be
the Formaldehyde, babe.

203
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:07,886
Dude, respect.

204
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,657
For once, I agree wlth the
debutantes. Let's just get out of here.

205
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:14,325
I hate to Interrupt
the productlon meetlng

206
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,960
but I got two busted front
tires and only one spare,

207
00:14:17,036 --> 00:14:18,469
we ain't
going nowhere.

208
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:19,732
Call Triple A.

209
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:21,568
Call them yourself,
dlabla rubla.

210
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:23,609
God! Do I have
to do everything?

211
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,977
There's no signaI.

212
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:31,642
Que sorpresal

213
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:34,242
Pleasant dreams, m'Ijosl

214
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:44,392
What? They spelled it in French.

215
00:15:09,555 --> 00:15:11,182
K- Jay! I said no anaI!

216
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:13,817
Babe, don't look at me!

217
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:19,422
U h, I was just checking
the, uh, the battery and-

218
00:15:19,498 --> 00:15:22,797
Come on, babe, let's get some privacy.

219
00:15:22,868 --> 00:15:26,770
That's right, fooI. Get
sticky with yourself.

220
00:15:32,411 --> 00:15:36,108
Oh, yeah, baby! Lower,

221
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:37,945

Oh, nightmare.

Tinkle time.

227
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:58,526
Make that tinkle

228
00:15:58,604 --> 00:16:00,697

248
00:16:54,627 --> 00:16:59,621
Why, that's
my pooch box.

249
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,496
Pooch box?

250
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:04,058
Scarlet Red means

251
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:08,869
come her 18th birthday I
may present her with the key.

252
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:11,774
She's very progresslve.

00:17:11,844 --> 00:17:17,214
Oh, you good at licking rock, Hollywood?

254
00:17:17,283 --> 00:17:20,480
Hell, I'll llck

255
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:24,717
China Rose
is trying to say

256
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:30,023
" Picking locks?
My lock. "

257
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:32,326
I can pick locks.

258
00:17:32,398 --> 00:17:35,856
When I was a kid, I broke into a shul,

259
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:40,429
and the Shammes caught
me lifting a challah.

260
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:44,408
Holy Moly I Folks,
we got ourselves a Hebrew I

261
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:48,172
That's "Jew"
to you, ColoneI.

262
00:17:48,247 --> 00:17:52,684
Jew, Hebrew, Chrlst-klller,
It's all the same In Spaln.

263
00:17:52,752 --> 00:17:54,982
That reminds me,

264
00:17:55,054 --> 00:18:00,048
what's the difference between
an Israeli and an Israelite?

265
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:03,118
About 100 calories.

266
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:05,425
Moving right
along, folks.

267
00:18:05,498 --> 00:18:07,932
Every year, down in
Georgia, we put on a show-

268
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,059
Wait a minute.

Why, yeah, ma'am,

270
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:17,031
Do you think we could cheat
this locaI for Georgia?

271
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:20,670
For the rlght prlce,
I can play Laguna Beach

272
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:23,044

Christ on a cracker, boys.

286
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,824
After all
these 140 odd years,

287
00:19:09,895 --> 00:19:14,264
sometlmes, I thlnk
we should just,

00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:18,269
burn the whole goddamn
North in one giant bonfire!

289
00:19:18,337 --> 00:19:22,671
Ah, but,
what's the style In that?

290
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:24,504
One shot discharge-

291
00:19:24,577 --> 00:19:28,206

and qulte frankly, tradltlon
Is about all we got left.

295
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:46,064
The network
is gonna love this,

296
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:48,156
a bunch
of redneck outsiders

297
00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:50,566
who thought the South won the CiviI War.

298
00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:52,331
They didn't?

299
00:19:52,404 --> 00:19:54,338
No, Tina,
they didn't.

300
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:56,874
Duh, that's rlght.
It was the Nazls.

301
00:19:56,942 --> 00:19:59,240
Anyway, while our
sister act pretties up...

302
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:01,779
Jesus, you and Jerry

303
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:05,840
go and do some scouting. See if you
can find some indigenous locations here.

304
00:20:05,918 --> 00:20:08,478
You do know what
"indigenous" means, right?

305
00:20:08,554 --> 00:20:12,854
Hey, VaI, why don't you, me and BristoI

You know, put

308
00:20:18,597 --> 00:20:21,657
If you don't mind, I'd rather
go with Jesus and Cherry.

309
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:23,565
What? You got a thing for this cholo?

310
00:20:23,636 --> 00:20:26,196
What's that? You want me

311
00:20:26,272 --> 00:20:27,864
Chill out, Jay.

Come on, get over It,

323

Yeah, JezebeI, too.

Except she earned her spot in
the section called " Provisions"!

332
00:21:30,469 --> 00:21:32,437
You don't mean

00:22:09,308 --> 00:22:12,209

Yeah, the labeI wants me to record, too.

346
00:22:14,847 --> 00:22:16,314

352
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:46,711

355
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:00,515
Guess that was me.

356
00:23:00,592 --> 00:23:03,561
Oh, baby, you're no dumb
blond, you're just misinformed.

357
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:08,396
See, it's not the writers or directors
that get you ahead, it's the teamsters.

358
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:10,230
You stick with me,
I'll hook you up.

359
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:12,327
Yeah, I've never heard that one before.

360
00:23:12,404 --> 00:23:15,168
Bitch, I ain't

Oh, yeah? So who are you

For one, a bunch of buddies got
this indie hard thing going on.

363
00:23:21,013 --> 00:23:23,379
See, horror has its hell
these days, you know?

364
00:23:23,449 --> 00:23:26,543
I would love to get
killed in a horror flick.

365
00:23:26,618 --> 00:23:28,779

Yo, ladies.

369
00:23:39,998 --> 00:23:42,228

00:23:42,301 --> 00:23:45,702
Oh, Yankee

371
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:47,363

Give me

373
00:23:49,108 --> 00:23:52,236
Now that a gentleman
has eased our burden

374
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:54,871
we can finally
commence to practice.

375
00:23:54,947 --> 00:23:58,508
U h, excuse me ladies, but we were
in the middle of a conversation here.

376
00:23:58,584 --> 00:24:00,916

Madre de Dios.
Definitely more tongue.

382
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:19,831
Are you getting this?
You are perfect, Granny.

383
00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:22,032
Sure you got
a tight shot?

384
00:24:22,107 --> 00:24:23,870
Yeah, I got it.

385
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:25,842
Let's start
shootlng, come on.

386
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:28,209
Am I good?
My rouge looks good?

387
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,872

All rlght. Cut. Cut I

391
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,815
Excuse me, but-

392
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:44,124
I'll excuse me,

393
00:24:44,196 --> 00:24:46,858
and I'm the one
who calls "Cut. "

394
00:24:46,932 --> 00:24:50,299
I write
the checks, okay?

395
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:53,702
All right, the
structures aren't working.

396
00:24:53,772 --> 00:24:57,208
Let me think. Granny,

00:25:08,987 --> 00:25:13,287
You can boiI it,

Yo, get that beast

00:26:36,308 --> 00:26:38,868
That beast is my

00:26:38,944 --> 00:26:41,777

The secret
to Southern home cooking

451
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:02,678
is you never ever tenderize
without loving your blade.

452

I love you.

453
00:29:05,424 --> 00:29:08,120

00:30:04,282 --> 00:30:07,251
Well, you got
yourself a boo-boo.

472
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:11,779
When our livestock gets a boo-boo
we take 'em back and shoot 'em.

473
00:30:11,857 --> 00:30:14,257
Please let me go, please.

474
00:30:14,326 --> 00:30:17,352
You don't have to worry none,
honey. We ain't gonna shoot ya.

475
00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:19,488
That would be
way too boring.

476
00:30:19,564 --> 00:30:20,929
Ah!

477
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:23,297

478
00:30:23,368 --> 00:30:25,700
No, please. I'm a good
girI, I'll do anything.

479
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:30,571
Thls llttle plggy went to market.
And thls llttle plggy's stayed home.

480
00:30:30,642 --> 00:30:34,134
And this little piggy
went whoo whoo whoo.

481
00:30:34,212 --> 00:30:37,648
La, la, la.
All the way home!

482
00:31:21,726 --> 00:31:23,353
Guess who?

483
00:31:23,428 --> 00:31:26,454
You know what Granny told you
about coming in here like this.

484
00:31:26,531 --> 00:31:29,591
Aw, the heck
with her, Jemima!

485
00:31:29,668 --> 00:31:33,764
My passion for you
is stronger than candy.

486
00:31:33,838 --> 00:31:36,238
It's hotter
than corn bread.

487
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:38,742
It's sweeter
than watermelon.

488
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,904
H m. Remember the first time
you crept into my stable,

489
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,175

were gonna be,

490
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:46,046
I'd be
your tar baby,

491
00:31:46,117 --> 00:31:48,347
I'd do
whatever you like,

492
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:52,754
no matter how dirty, or nasty
or forbidden it might be?

493
00:31:52,824 --> 00:31:56,089
I am your
lord and master.

494
00:31:56,161 --> 00:32:01,030
Are you really? Are
you really in charge?

495
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:03,499
U h,

00:32:07,405 --> 00:32:09,930
I'm gonna lick

499
00:32:13,345 --> 00:32:15,370
Ah, Jemlma.

500
00:32:22,587 --> 00:32:24,145
Oh!

502
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,292
No, Granny!
No. No.

503
00:32:29,361 --> 00:32:35,459
You're just thinking about your darker
nature, is what you're thinking about.

504
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:37,831
Go on!

505
00:32:37,902 --> 00:32:43,033
Oh, you race trader,

00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:55,979
# Do you even know
Who you are? #

511
00:32:56,054 --> 00:32:58,784
# Facebook Superstar #

512
00:33:06,498 --> 00:33:08,898
This is
a very expensive,

513
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:10,764
very uninsured camera

00:45:06,283 --> 00:45:08,717
He didn't smile.

687
00:45:08,786 --> 00:45:10,651
Oh, well.

688
00:45:17,895 --> 00:45:22,195
# Yankee Doodle went to town
To bone hlmself a hottle #

689
00:45:22,266 --> 00:45:23,756

00:45:23,834 --> 00:45:25,825
# Stuck hls feather

692
00:45:27,438 --> 00:45:28,700
Hell, yeah. Fresh baked.

693
00:45:28,773 --> 00:45:30,035

694
00:45:30,107 --> 00:45:32,905

00:45:32,977 --> 00:45:35,309

696
00:45:37,114 --> 00:45:39,674
Typlcal I I'm out there,
sweatlng my ass off,

697
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,684
and the two of you
are sitting here,

698
00:45:41,752 --> 00:45:45,813
getting this mentally
ill child stoned.

699
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,585
Shut the fuck up, retard!

700
00:45:47,658 --> 00:45:50,889
It's H ucklebilly, M ister.

701
00:45:52,563 --> 00:45:55,930
I promlse, I'll
just fllm It, no web.

702
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,697
So anyone know whether
Jackass ever found Brlstol?

703
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:01,761
Hate to brlng
It to you, Moses,

704
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:05,673
he's probably off plowing
BristoI in some corn field by now.

705
00:46:05,743 --> 00:46:08,906
Excuse me, that's Rome's
boyfriend you're talking about.

706
00:46:08,979 --> 00:46:10,674
Yeah, man, don't be a hater.

707
00:46:10,748 --> 00:46:13,581
Suck my salty
Salvadorlan sack.

708
00:46:13,651 --> 00:46:17,610
You'd probably like that. You
little twisted reality show wannabe.

709
00:46:17,688 --> 00:46:19,656
Enough I Look, Jesus,

710
00:46:19,723 --> 00:46:23,625
unless you want to crash the unemployment
line like the rest of your famllla,

711
00:46:23,694 --> 00:46:26,959
I suggest you get
this tin can moving!

712
00:46:27,031 --> 00:46:29,465
As soon as we get what we
want from these rednecks

713
00:46:29,533 --> 00:46:32,434
we'll get the hell out of
this fucking two-bit shit hole!

714
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:35,066
Come on!

715
00:46:35,139 --> 00:46:36,766
All right.
I hear you, boss.

716
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:38,433
I can scam
one of them tires

717
00:46:38,509 --> 00:46:40,841
off that old schooI bus
those freaks got

718
00:46:40,911 --> 00:46:42,845
Whatever It takes.

719
00:46:42,913 --> 00:46:47,373
I wouldn't advlse
that, my frlends.

720
00:46:47,451 --> 00:46:48,884
Some folks
around here

721
00:46:48,953 --> 00:46:53,287
just might be inclined to
define that as stealing.

722
00:46:53,357 --> 00:46:54,949
Stealing is
a sin.

723
00:46:55,025 --> 00:46:59,121
I wasn't gonna
steal nothlng, abuellta.

724
00:46:59,196 --> 00:47:01,664
I said "borrow. "

725
00:47:20,284 --> 00:47:23,845
I guess borrowing is okay.
That ain't stealing.

726
00:47:23,921 --> 00:47:26,685
Maybe we can help
you out with the tire.

727
00:47:26,757 --> 00:47:28,691
But first-

728
00:47:31,929 --> 00:47:35,126
Yee-haw I

729
00:47:46,877 --> 00:47:50,040
I'll tell ya', Granny,
that dlsplay of majesty

730
00:47:50,114 --> 00:47:52,014
makes this ColoneI
weak in the knees

731
00:47:52,082 --> 00:47:53,606
and full
in the groin.

732
00:47:53,684 --> 00:47:55,208
Ugh!

733
00:47:55,286 --> 00:47:58,380
Bucky, I ain't
begging no more.

734
00:47:58,455 --> 00:48:02,687
It's tlme you dlscharge your
musket, Confederate style.

735
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,524
Madam, lead me
to my executlon.

736
00:48:05,596 --> 00:48:08,064
Yee-haw I

737
00:48:08,132 --> 00:48:10,293
You'd better be getting all this.

738
00:48:10,367 --> 00:48:12,028
This is money
in the bank.

739
00:48:12,102 --> 00:48:14,297
Solld gold.

740
00:48:14,371 --> 00:48:18,068
Oh!
Buck-man. Buck-man.

741
00:48:20,444 --> 00:48:26,308
Buck-man. Buck-man.

742
00:48:26,383 --> 00:48:28,874
Candy apples.

743
00:48:28,953 --> 00:48:31,478
Buck. Buck. Buck.

744
00:48:31,555 --> 00:48:32,681
Candy apples?

745
00:48:32,756 --> 00:48:35,418
Yee-haw!

746
00:48:35,492 --> 00:48:37,653
How do you like
these candy apples?

747
00:48:37,728 --> 00:48:39,855
Them aln't real.
Them's plastlc.

748
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:43,229
Probably got
worms in it, too.

749
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,064
My mighty sword!
My mighty sword!

750
00:48:46,136 --> 00:48:49,037
My mlghty sword I

751
00:48:49,106 --> 00:48:53,905
Crow! Crow! Crow!

752
00:48:53,978 --> 00:48:55,036
Crow?

753
00:48:57,681 --> 00:48:58,943
Crow?

754
00:48:59,016 --> 00:49:00,677
Buck?

755
00:49:00,751 --> 00:49:03,379
Oh,

756
00:49:03,454 --> 00:49:05,012
too much dark meat,
bitch!

757
00:49:05,089 --> 00:49:06,920
Ah!

758
00:49:10,794 --> 00:49:13,729
Now, for our
next demonstration,

759
00:49:13,797 --> 00:49:16,095
we're gonna need
another volunteer.

760
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:18,066
Oh, oh, oh I

761
00:49:18,135 --> 00:49:19,534
Ugh.

762
00:49:19,603 --> 00:49:22,163
You boy, with the smiling
eyes, you'll do fine.

763
00:49:23,374 --> 00:49:24,500
Yes!

764
00:49:24,575 --> 00:49:26,042
M ighty fine.

765
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:28,943
Come on up
now, boy.

766
00:49:29,013 --> 00:49:32,471
I ain't got
eternity. Come on.

767
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:34,813
Don't mind
the darkness none.

768
00:49:34,885 --> 00:49:37,547
You ain't never heard
Helen Keller complain.

769
00:49:37,621 --> 00:49:40,385
Turn around now, boy.
Step on rlght up on here.

770
00:49:40,457 --> 00:49:43,085
Come one. Show everybody
your pretty face.

771
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,594
Now you see him?

772
00:49:45,663 --> 00:49:46,687
U h-

773
00:49:48,032 --> 00:49:50,262
Now you don't!

774
00:49:58,242 --> 00:50:02,611
So, should I keep
the blindfold on, or-

775
00:50:13,857 --> 00:50:15,586
U h, hello?

776
00:50:18,762 --> 00:50:20,627
Hello?

777
00:50:20,698 --> 00:50:22,859
So weird.

778
00:50:22,933 --> 00:50:26,369
Ah, okay.

779
00:50:26,437 --> 00:50:29,304
Hello?

780
00:50:29,373 --> 00:50:32,399
Hello. Is anybody here?

781
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:47,718
Howdie ho there, boy.

782
00:50:47,791 --> 00:50:49,452
What the fuck?
It hurts.

783
00:50:49,526 --> 00:50:53,053
What kind of man are you, you
can't handle a little arm wrestle?

784
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:57,226
Shit, Rufus. I knew
you were different.

785
00:50:57,301 --> 00:50:59,667
I knew you
were different.

786
00:50:59,737 --> 00:51:02,103
You see right through me, don't you?

787
00:51:02,172 --> 00:51:04,402
Right through
your heart.

788
00:51:04,475 --> 00:51:06,238
My heart?

789
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:09,973
Yeah, you know, all my life
I've kept my heart in the closet.

790
00:51:10,047 --> 00:51:14,746
Lately though, my ass keeps poking out.

791
00:51:19,156 --> 00:51:22,023
Whoa! I ain't
queer like that!

792
00:51:22,092 --> 00:51:24,720
But that don't mean you gotta stop.

793
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:31,133
I don't know.

794
00:51:31,201 --> 00:51:34,329
Maybe you're right.

795
00:51:34,405 --> 00:51:37,636
Listen, this is the
wrong time, wrong place.

796
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:39,573
I'm dead!

797
00:51:39,643 --> 00:51:41,668
Ain't that the truth.

798
00:51:44,681 --> 00:51:46,444
Ugh. Agh!

799
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,219

00:56:16,386 --> 00:56:17,819
Wait. Time out!

861
00:56:17,888 --> 00:56:18,820
Time out!

862
00:56:21,258 --> 00:56:22,486

00:56:24,895 --> 00:56:26,123
Yeah!

864
00:56:26,196 --> 00:56:29,495
Yay I

865
00:56:46,883 --> 00:56:48,441
Aside from that,
M rs. Lincoln,

866
00:56:48,518 --> 00:56:50,110
did you enjoy
the show?

867
00:56:50,187 --> 00:56:51,882
Fuck this shit.

868
00:56:51,955 --> 00:56:52,683
Ah I

869
00:56:58,161 --> 00:57:01,153
Now, now, now that
you're all a llttle groggy

870
00:57:01,231 --> 00:57:04,462
the fresh air otta
take care of that.

871
00:57:04,534 --> 00:57:07,628
We're all here and we're
gonna play a little game,

872
00:57:07,704 --> 00:57:11,936
a llttle game we call the
Revlsltatlon of the troubles.

873
00:57:16,713 --> 00:57:19,307
ApriI 22, 1864,

874
00:57:19,382 --> 00:57:22,283
we were living our lives,
minding our own business,

875
00:57:22,352 --> 00:57:24,149
when the Yankee man came.

876
00:57:24,221 --> 00:57:28,180
When you came! killed us all,
destroyed our way of life.

877
00:57:28,258 --> 00:57:30,453
Hell, we weren't
ready back then,

878
00:57:30,527 --> 00:57:32,859
but thls tlme we are.

879
00:57:32,929 --> 00:57:35,921
War's over, jefe, you fucking
lost, move the fuck on!

880
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:39,696
Well, that's preclsely
what we alm to do,

881
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:42,864
muchacho, precisely.

882
00:57:42,939 --> 00:57:45,840
You're telling me you're
with these crackers?

883
00:57:45,909 --> 00:57:48,434
I was with these
crackers when your kind

884
00:57:48,512 --> 00:57:51,003
came condemnlng us all
to the same fate.

885
00:57:51,081 --> 00:57:53,709
"My kind?" What the fuck's
wrong with you, brother?

886
00:57:53,784 --> 00:57:57,515
I'm not your bother.
I'm Southern bred.

887
00:57:57,587 --> 00:58:00,579
And you,
M iss Gutter Mouth,

888
00:58:00,657 --> 00:58:03,251
you'd be Northern scum.

889
00:58:03,326 --> 00:58:04,725
Now, now, Crow.

890
00:58:04,795 --> 00:58:07,229
Remember we're trying
not the use the " N" word.

891
00:58:07,297 --> 00:58:09,322
You're right
on that one.

892
00:58:11,701 --> 00:58:13,362
That's rlght I

893
00:58:13,436 --> 00:58:18,203
Now let's see here, from here to
the road it's a couple of miles,

894
00:58:18,275 --> 00:58:20,800
same dlstance we had to
flee from Pleasant Valley,

895
00:58:20,877 --> 00:58:23,505
now, there's no sport In
shootlng flsh In a barrel.

896
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:26,105
so we hid some guns
and ammo along the way.

897
00:58:26,183 --> 00:58:30,210
Now, If ya'll can go out there and
flnd them and put up a good flght

898
00:58:30,287 --> 00:58:32,551
why, you're
free to go.

899
00:58:32,622 --> 00:58:35,090
Oh, that is bloody bullocks!

900
00:58:35,158 --> 00:58:36,785
If you don't
let us go now,

901
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:40,660
I'll have my lawyer slaughter
you before you can say spectrum.

902
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:42,925
I mean It,
mother fuckerl

903
00:58:44,467 --> 00:58:46,662
Spectrum?

904
00:58:46,736 --> 00:58:47,998
I'm not klddlng I

905
00:58:48,071 --> 00:58:50,198
Nelther are we, Mlss.

906
00:58:50,273 --> 00:58:53,174
I n case you have
any doubt, M iss Maiden.

907
00:58:53,243 --> 00:58:55,803
H m.

908
00:59:11,528 --> 00:59:14,691
K- Jay?

909
00:59:14,764 --> 00:59:16,698
Ma-ma-ma-ma.

910
00:59:22,873 --> 00:59:24,704
Falcon I

911
00:59:24,774 --> 00:59:27,004
Bastards!

Presentatlon. Well,

Gimme that!

916
01:00:12,255 --> 01:00:18,216
# Bulldlng from
the ground up #

917
01:00:18,295 --> 01:00:21,230
# Starting nowhere #

918
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:27,599
Did you see what they did to
K- Jay, Biscuit? They killed him.

919
01:00:27,671 --> 01:00:29,935
They fucking
killed Falcon, too.

920
01:00:30,006 --> 01:00:32,839
We were gonna present at the
Teen Dream Awards together.

921
01:00:32,909 --> 01:00:35,241
You were?

922
01:00:35,312 --> 01:00:38,509
# Well, they put us
I n our #

923
01:00:38,581 --> 01:00:41,846
Crying over spilled blood is
not gonna get us outta here,

924
01:00:41,918 --> 01:00:44,614
we gotta find those guns
and cap those mother fuckers.

925
01:00:44,688 --> 01:00:48,317
You're right. You and
Cherry head for the RV.

926
01:00:48,391 --> 01:00:51,690
Fix that damn tire, I'll grab
the girls and find those weapons.

927
01:00:51,761 --> 01:00:53,820
What are you gonna
do if you find them?

928
01:00:53,897 --> 01:00:57,162
I know my way around weapons. My
mother used to be a prison guard.

929
01:00:57,233 --> 01:00:59,531
That explains a lot.

930
01:00:59,602 --> 01:01:02,867
# Again #

931
01:01:08,945 --> 01:01:11,470
Bleed that heathen
good and dry, son.

932
01:01:11,548 --> 01:01:13,482
We could all use
an after dinner tonic.

933
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:15,313
When do we get
to eat supper, Daddy?

934
01:01:15,385 --> 01:01:17,876
Aln't you done
chewlng on that surfer?

935
01:01:17,954 --> 01:01:21,981
What about me, Daddy? AII I had was
a gristle from Jezzie's hindquarters.

936
01:01:22,058 --> 01:01:25,721
Oh, enough I Stlflel
Go on, glt I

937
01:01:29,766 --> 01:01:31,734
What are you

938
01:01:31,801 --> 01:01:35,396
Why don't you do some of that Chlnese
laundry we Imported you here for?

939
01:01:35,472 --> 01:01:39,738
Thls tlme get out the blood stalnsl I
don't want no rlng around the collar.

940
01:01:39,809 --> 01:01:42,744
Your wlsh Is my command, Mayor Luckman,

941
01:01:42,812 --> 01:01:46,680

Go on, glt I

943
01:01:48,385 --> 01:01:51,684
Well, I see there, Ganny,

944
01:01:51,755 --> 01:01:55,088
looks llke you're favorlng that
dark meat a llttle blt too much.

945
01:01:55,158 --> 01:01:58,719
Maybe if you were a little bit
more black in your stallion,

946
01:01:58,795 --> 01:02:01,730
I wouldn't need to visit the
stable on long lonely nights.

947
01:02:01,798 --> 01:02:06,235
How many Northerners to seek
vengeance on 'tll we can flnally rest?

948
01:02:06,302 --> 01:02:08,532
Well, let's see, uh,

949
01:02:08,605 --> 01:02:12,769
last jamboree I thlnk we
took care of 8 of them.

950
01:02:12,842 --> 01:02:14,173
It's 9 here wlth thls now,

951
01:02:14,244 --> 01:02:16,542
It still only makes
us half way to 2001.

952
01:02:16,613 --> 01:02:20,845
Dang it, does that mean we have to
go through this shit again next year?

953
01:02:20,917 --> 01:02:22,680
Ah, don't complaln.

954
01:02:22,752 --> 01:02:28,349
Oh I My bunlons
are kllllng mel

955
01:02:28,425 --> 01:02:32,555
If I was one of those psychos
where would I hide those weapons?

956
01:02:32,629 --> 01:02:35,530
Kinda like
an Easter egg hunt.

957
01:02:35,598 --> 01:02:37,725
H uh?

958
01:02:37,801 --> 01:02:40,998
Yes.

959
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:48,304
How old is this piece of shit?
It's fucking rusted together!

960
01:02:48,378 --> 01:02:51,814
Whatever. I'm gonna smoke
and laugh about all this.

961
01:02:51,881 --> 01:02:53,542
Are you fucking
crazy, negra?

962
01:02:53,616 --> 01:02:56,517
Those rednecks think this is
the CiviI War or something.

963
01:02:56,586 --> 01:02:58,679
I always knew the South
was loco, but damn I

964
01:02:58,755 --> 01:02:59,881
Shit!

965
01:02:59,956 --> 01:03:01,719
Are you okay?

966
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:05,887
Fuck finding a tire. I say we ditch
those bitches and save ourselves.

967
01:03:05,962 --> 01:03:07,554
Let's go.

968
01:03:10,233 --> 01:03:12,064
The Kosher way
to do this is what?

969
01:03:12,135 --> 01:03:14,968
You gotta cut the throat
and let the blood draln.

970
01:03:15,038 --> 01:03:17,029
This Jew boy ain't
got no throat no more.

971
01:03:17,107 --> 01:03:19,541
Well, then, cut
his balls off, I guess.

972
01:03:19,609 --> 01:03:21,133
Yeah, I guess.

973
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:30,545
Speaklng of balls, I've been
meanlng to mentlon somethlng to you.

974
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:32,110
I just don't get you.

975
01:03:32,188 --> 01:03:33,348
What?

976
01:03:33,423 --> 01:03:35,448
You know.
Your taste.

977
01:03:35,525 --> 01:03:37,254
Explaln me thls, brother.

978
01:03:37,327 --> 01:03:40,888
You, brother, spend your time on
some soft girlie girI like JezebeI.

979
01:03:40,964 --> 01:03:44,365
Gosslplng, shopplng
and settln' up house.

980
01:03:44,434 --> 01:03:47,494
I, on the other hand,
like to hang a reaI man,

981
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:50,903
practicing,
soldiering,

982
01:03:50,974 --> 01:03:53,238
and wrestling.
And my taste?

983
01:03:53,309 --> 01:03:57,040
You tell me, brother, who's really
on the side of the Lord here?

984
01:04:03,953 --> 01:04:06,148
You gotta be fucking
with me. This easy?

985
01:04:09,259 --> 01:04:10,692
I guess not.
No ammo.

986
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,022
You're klddlng me.

987
01:04:12,095 --> 01:04:15,030
Fuck this cracker,
VaI, let's go.

988
01:04:15,098 --> 01:04:18,693
Slnce our llves
are serlously at stake,

989
01:04:18,768 --> 01:04:20,827
there's something
I have to ask you.

990
01:04:20,904 --> 01:04:22,098
Go ahead, babe.

991
01:04:22,172 --> 01:04:24,106
If they find us
dead here

992
01:04:24,174 --> 01:04:27,837
our bodies naked on display
for the whole world to see-

993
01:04:27,911 --> 01:04:29,538
You mean like
in your video?

994
01:04:29,612 --> 01:04:32,080
I'm being
serious, Tina.

995
01:04:32,148 --> 01:04:34,116
Flne. Splll It.

996
01:04:34,184 --> 01:04:37,244
All right. I'm just
gonna come out and say it.

997
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,345
Do my thighs
look fat?

998
01:04:39,422 --> 01:04:41,515
Oh, my God I
Rome, a gun I

999
01:04:41,591 --> 01:04:43,058
You thlnk It's real?

1000
01:04:43,126 --> 01:04:45,492
Ah I Tlttlesl

1001
01:04:45,562 --> 01:04:46,790
Ugh!

1002
01:04:46,863 --> 01:04:48,694
Looks reaI.

1003
01:04:51,968 --> 01:04:54,095
Fuck, we're goin'
around in circles.

1004
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:56,104
I don't get it, Jay.

1005
01:04:56,172 --> 01:04:57,730
That's it.
Let's split up.

1006
01:04:57,807 --> 01:04:59,365
I don't wanna
split up. M m-hm.

1007
01:04:59,442 --> 01:05:00,841
Look-

1008
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:04,641
If one of us gets away
we're both saved, right?

1009
01:05:04,714 --> 01:05:07,512
You know I'll
come back with help.

1010
01:05:07,584 --> 01:05:08,812
I guess
you're right.

1011
01:05:08,885 --> 01:05:11,080
Of course
I'm right, baby.

1012
01:05:11,154 --> 01:05:13,019
You go that way,
I'll go this way,

1013
01:05:13,089 --> 01:05:14,716
one of us is gonna
find the road.

1014
01:05:14,791 --> 01:05:16,554
Okay, but be safe.

1015
01:05:16,626 --> 01:05:18,685
You know I will.

1016
01:05:18,761 --> 01:05:22,322
What about a gun?
Don't I need one, too?

1017
01:05:22,398 --> 01:05:25,390
Well, at least
we found a gun.

1018
01:05:25,468 --> 01:05:27,265
Should I say
thank you for that?

1019
01:05:27,337 --> 01:05:29,237
It was an accldent,
Val. God I

1020
01:05:29,305 --> 01:05:32,536
Do you always have to rag
on us, we have feelings, too.

1021
01:05:32,609 --> 01:05:36,340
Yeah, like we didn't feeI bad
when the avalanche hit New Orleans.

1022
01:05:36,412 --> 01:05:39,540
Okey-dokey,
now. One.

1023
01:05:39,616 --> 01:05:41,607
Oh, no, you
girls despise me.

1024
01:05:41,684 --> 01:05:44,084
Why can't you see me
like I see you?

1025
01:05:44,153 --> 01:05:45,313
Threel

1026
01:05:45,388 --> 01:05:46,582
Oops.

1027
01:05:46,656 --> 01:05:48,248
Agh!

1028
01:05:48,324 --> 01:05:50,292
Ah I

1029

1042
01:07:04,834 --> 01:07:06,927
Looking for
the U nderground Railroad?

1043
01:07:09,739 --> 01:07:11,969
Hey, Granny.

1044
01:07:14,911 --> 01:07:19,007
Do you think the Mayor would mind if
we kept that beaner boy to ourselves?

1045
01:07:19,082 --> 01:07:22,415
I don't know, sweetie. I'd rather
kill him than fuck him any day.

1046
01:07:22,485 --> 01:07:25,113
Sh, sh, sh.

1047
01:07:25,188 --> 01:07:26,450
Do you

1048
01:07:26,522 --> 01:07:27,682
No.

1049
01:07:27,757 --> 01:07:31,284
# Rock a-bye baby,
On the tree top #

1050
01:07:31,361 --> 01:07:35,263
# When the wind blows #

1051
01:07:35,331 --> 01:07:39,028
# The cradle will rock #

1052
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:45,603
# When the bough breaks
The cradle will fall #

1053
01:07:45,675 --> 01:07:49,805
# And down wlll come baby #

1054

# Cradle and all I #

1055
01:07:55,718 --> 01:08:00,348
I always knew
those little cunts

1056
01:08:00,423 --> 01:08:03,483
would be the end of me.

1057
01:08:08,865 --> 01:08:10,992
Blscult's really
dead meat, huh?

1058
01:08:11,067 --> 01:08:13,433
Yes, sweetie.
She really is.

1059
01:08:13,503 --> 01:08:15,471
We're dead meat,
too, aren't we?

1060
01:08:15,538 --> 01:08:18,234
No, Romy, we're gonna be okay. Trust me.

1061
01:08:18,307 --> 01:08:22,334
That's what you said the time
we got crabs tag teaming K-Jay.

1062
01:08:25,481 --> 01:08:27,449
Whoopsle-dalsy I

1063
01:08:27,517 --> 01:08:29,144
Oh.

1064
01:08:29,218 --> 01:08:31,812
I thought the Mayor
sald kllllng Mexlcans

1065
01:08:31,888 --> 01:08:33,822
dldn't count
towards the total.

1066
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:35,551
No, they don't deary.

1067
01:08:35,625 --> 01:08:38,685
They aln't North, they
aln't South, they just aln't.

1068
01:08:40,797 --> 01:08:44,233
But there's nothlng wrong
wlth a llttle sport kllllng.

1069
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:47,167
So long as it puts
food on the table.

1070
01:08:51,607 --> 01:08:54,542
It must've
been a squlrrel.

1071
01:08:54,610 --> 01:08:56,874
Come on along, now.

1072
01:09:02,485 --> 01:09:04,453
Peekaboo.

1073
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:08,088
Ah!

1074
01:09:11,627 --> 01:09:14,289
Can't you Northern folks
do nothing right?

1075
01:09:16,699 --> 01:09:19,065
Tonlght at dlnner,
yet agaln,

1076
01:09:19,135 --> 01:09:23,162
caught Granny picking
a little too tenderly

1077
01:09:23,239 --> 01:09:25,969
on a dark part
of her brisket.

1078
01:09:26,042 --> 01:09:29,034
Got anything
to say about that, boy?

1079
01:09:29,111 --> 01:09:31,102
Ugh!

1080
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:33,478
I ain't
nobody's boy.

1081
01:09:33,549 --> 01:09:35,414
Not even yours.

1082
01:09:36,652 --> 01:09:38,586
Maybe so, Crow.

1083
01:09:38,654 --> 01:09:42,886
Would it be too hard just
to, uh, stick to your chores?

1084
01:09:42,959 --> 01:09:44,119
Ah!

1085
01:09:44,193 --> 01:09:48,425
I do stick
to my chores,

1086
01:09:48,498 --> 01:09:50,557
as much as I find
them distastefuI,

1087
01:09:50,633 --> 01:09:54,660
And whlch one of you are too
tlred from ploughlng the flelds,

1088
01:09:54,737 --> 01:09:56,637

01:09:56,706 --> 01:09:59,266

1118
01:11:58,661 --> 01:12:02,927
They wanna keep us
all caged up.

1119
01:12:02,999 --> 01:12:06,867
Cage our bodies,

Do you think
they're mad at us?

1151

We offered

1152
01:14:58,974 --> 01:15:03,570
sport, a chance to redeem
some sense of honor,

1153
01:15:03,646 --> 01:15:07,412
for the atrocities
committed by their ancestors.

1154
01:15:07,483 --> 01:15:10,418
And they play along
by running away.

1155
01:15:10,486 --> 01:15:12,283
