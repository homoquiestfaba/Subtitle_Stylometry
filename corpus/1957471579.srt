10
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,748
(cheerful music playing)

11
00:02:10,821 --> 00:02:12,756
Peace be with you, sisters.

12
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,659
Although, at first
I hesitated to deviate

13
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:18,595
from the usual solemnity
of our meal times,

14
00:02:19,063 --> 00:02:21,665
I had to acknowledge
that tonight, indeed,

15
00:02:21,798 --> 00:02:23,868
should be a joyous occasion.

16
00:02:25,002 --> 00:02:28,672
Sister Gertrude has been
with us for many years.

17
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,010
And celebrating the birthday
of a sister in Christ

18
00:02:33,576 --> 00:02:35,679
- summons us to-
- Nun: Whores!

19
00:02:36,247 --> 00:02:40,117
You are whores!
You are all whores of Christ!

20
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:42,920
And you will fucking burn
in hell!

21
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:46,456
You are vain
and you are lustful!

22
00:02:46,623 --> 00:02:50,094
And I see you! He sees you!

23
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:52,696
(yells)

24
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,334
Cocksuckers! (yells)

25
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,136
(demonic yelling)
...your fucking God!

26
00:02:59,703 --> 00:03:01,072
Fuck you!

27
00:03:01,272 --> 00:03:04,607
(operatic singing)

28
00:03:06,243 --> 00:03:10,081
- (animals calling)
- (water trickling)

29
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:21,225
(cars rushing by)

30
00:03:30,901 --> 00:03:32,803
Man: Maybe ever fretting shirt
of punishment

31
00:03:32,937 --> 00:03:35,940
give myrrh-threaded
the golden folds of ease.

32
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,109
Your scarce sheathed bones

33
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:39,709
are weary of being bent.

34
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:43,613
Lo, and God shall strengthen
all the feeble knees.

35
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:47,717
Benjamin, you remember
your Hopkins. (chuckles)

36
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,987
- You're looking well.
- Thank you.

37
00:03:51,088 --> 00:03:53,190
Uh, what were you
doing just now?

38
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,525
Admiring the handiwork.

39
00:03:56,593 --> 00:04:00,398
Not even Solomon in his glory
was arrayed as one of these.

40
00:04:01,165 --> 00:04:03,434
And I understand
congratulations are in order.

41
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:07,004
I heard you passed your exams,
if only just barely.

42
00:04:07,171 --> 00:04:09,040
Just as you taught me.
If you can't be good,

43
00:04:09,173 --> 00:04:10,174
be good enough.

44
00:04:10,341 --> 00:04:12,943
(laughs) Right.
Good advice for all of us.

45
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:15,179
And I'm kidding, of course.

46
00:04:15,645 --> 00:04:17,348
Reports are you did brilliantly.

47
00:04:17,815 --> 00:04:20,418
How long have you been out,
a semi-free man?

48
00:04:21,118 --> 00:04:22,619
Three weeks, Father Donaghue.

49
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,422
I'm gonna take my vows
in the spring.

50
00:04:24,554 --> 00:04:27,757
And then they're talking about
taking me on at St. Joseph's.

51
00:04:28,325 --> 00:04:29,793
Perfect, Saint Joe's.

52
00:04:30,094 --> 00:04:32,595
God knows we could use
one like you.

53
00:04:33,197 --> 00:04:34,298
Days like this,

54
00:04:34,432 --> 00:04:37,268
I think the church got
it wrong with Augustine.

55
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:41,172
Too much original sin.

56
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,706
It seems more likely
that we were conceived

57
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:45,810
in a state of original blessing.

58
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,812
Well, don't tell
the bishop that.

59
00:04:47,945 --> 00:04:49,612
Oh, of course I wouldn't.

60
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:53,683
Wait, the bishop?

61
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:56,786
Why are you here Benjamin?

62
00:04:58,222 --> 00:05:00,091
Well, they called on me
to fetch you,

63
00:05:00,891 --> 00:05:02,659
the bishops
in Father Cappa's office.

64
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:06,230
He's here? Jesus Christ. Fuck.

65
00:05:06,363 --> 00:05:08,466
And there's another
priest with them, too.

66
00:05:08,598 --> 00:05:10,267
Tall, glasses?

67
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:13,404
It's vicar general,
isn't it, Father Exley?

68
00:05:13,804 --> 00:05:15,139
I thought this was good news.

69
00:05:15,272 --> 00:05:17,208
No, Benjamin,
it is not good news.

70
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:20,077
- It's the worst possible news.
- How do you know that?

71
00:05:20,211 --> 00:05:22,779
Ah, Christ, and they
sent you to fetch me,

72
00:05:23,481 --> 00:05:24,714
to humiliate me, no doubt.

73
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:26,450
What are you even
talking about?

74
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:29,386
Just forget it.
Thy will be done.

75
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:33,190
(ominous music playing)

76
00:05:33,623 --> 00:05:35,025
Take a seat, gentlemen.

77
00:05:46,703 --> 00:05:49,039
Father Exley: Relax, Frank,
it's not what you think.

78
00:05:53,043 --> 00:05:54,945
I assume you're familiar
with a convent

79
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,713
in the far corner
of our diocese,

80
00:05:57,181 --> 00:05:58,849
the Carmelite Santa Theresa?

81
00:05:59,283 --> 00:06:01,418
- Yes.
- Understand that this matter

82
00:06:01,552 --> 00:06:03,354
requires the utmost discretion.

83
00:06:03,854 --> 00:06:05,055
Of course.

84
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:07,591
You have special training,
I'm told.

85
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:11,728
All kinds. Not so much
with religious sisters.

86
00:06:11,862 --> 00:06:14,797
- Do you think this is funny?
- Let's just cut to the chase.

87
00:06:17,101 --> 00:06:18,735
Two weeks ago,
there was an incident

88
00:06:18,869 --> 00:06:21,172
with one of the sisters
at Santa Teresa.

89
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:25,109
An incident? You're serious?

90
00:06:25,242 --> 00:06:28,245
His eminence and I rarely
leave the seat of the diocese.

91
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:31,982
I assure you,
we are absolutely serious.

92
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,053
Does he need to be here?
I don't think he's ready.

93
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,089
Frank, just stop.
They have their reasons.

94
00:06:39,557 --> 00:06:40,690
We'll get to that later.

95
00:06:41,058 --> 00:06:42,759
I have to admit,
I don't understand.

96
00:06:42,927 --> 00:06:44,195
Father Donaghue:
Be glad you don't.

97
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:47,464
They're talking about
the Holy Rite of Exorcism.

98
00:06:48,432 --> 00:06:50,901
- So, what happened?
- The signs are all there,

99
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:53,437
spontaneous violent outbursts,

100
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:55,973
eruptions of vile blasphemy,

101
00:06:56,173 --> 00:06:58,042
surprising feats of strength.

102
00:06:58,842 --> 00:07:01,011
Their diagnoses
was inconclusive.

103
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,713
Dissociative disorder?

104
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:06,617
Father Exley: Yes.
So vague it might as well

105
00:07:06,783 --> 00:07:08,219
be demonic possession.

106
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:11,088
(suspenseful music playing)

107
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,657
Father Donaghue: What
do we know about this girl?

108
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,192
She's lived there for years.

109
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:18,395
Their record's almost a blank,
no family to call.

110
00:07:18,996 --> 00:07:24,201
No history of psychological
problems, sexual abuse?

111
00:07:24,602 --> 00:07:25,803
None that we know about.

112
00:07:26,036 --> 00:07:28,472
I almost find it amusing
you would ask that.

113
00:07:29,273 --> 00:07:31,242
This is hardly useful right now.

114
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,511
My apologies.

115
00:07:35,613 --> 00:07:37,147
But what will happen is this.

116
00:07:37,481 --> 00:07:40,884
The two of you will drive to
Santa Teresa early tomorrow,

117
00:07:41,218 --> 00:07:45,155
talk to the sisters, investigate
this poor girl's symptoms.

118
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:48,459
Stay as long as you need to.
Use your...

119
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:52,162
judgment.

120
00:07:54,198 --> 00:07:56,300
At the very least,
we need to rule out

121
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,901
the worst case scenario.

122
00:07:58,602 --> 00:08:02,840
Possession?
Actual demonic possession?

123
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:06,043
Right, you understand
I don't really believe

124
00:08:06,176 --> 00:08:08,912
in this medieval woo-woo?

125
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,516
You understand that you're
in no position to refuse?

126
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,053
The sisters
will be expecting you.

127
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,223
Father Cappa will help you
with anything else you need.

128
00:08:19,356 --> 00:08:21,191
You're dismissed,
Father Donaghue.

129
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,461
Father Cappa: Benjamin,
would you stay a moment?

130
00:08:25,396 --> 00:08:26,397
What did...

131
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,799
Oh. Gene, don't do this.

132
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:32,036
I'm sorry, Frank.

133
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:35,372
I'll talk to you
tomorrow morning.

134
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,209
(suspenseful music playing)

135
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:01,065
This is gonna be
difficult to hear.

136
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:02,933
It's hard to say.

137
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:04,601
He's been a good friend
of mine for years,

138
00:09:04,735 --> 00:09:07,271
and he's done so much
good for this parish.

139
00:09:07,404 --> 00:09:08,505
Until now.

140
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:10,407
We're sending him away,

141
00:09:10,641 --> 00:09:12,743
far away from here,
perhaps overseas.

142
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:14,078
What's going on?

143
00:09:14,712 --> 00:09:17,448
What is the shame
of the church right now?

144
00:09:19,616 --> 00:09:22,419
No, I don't believe it.

145
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,754
Father Cappa: I don't either.

146
00:09:24,722 --> 00:09:27,991
But accusations have been made,
and he doesn't deny them.

147
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,562
Pray for him,

148
00:09:32,896 --> 00:09:34,064
but keep an eye on him.

149
00:09:34,565 --> 00:09:37,501
We're afraid the added
pressure is making him...

150
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,538
- erratic.
- Desperate.

151
00:09:42,606 --> 00:09:44,508
Am I gonna have
to worry about...

152
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,113
- my own welfare?
- What do you mean?

153
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,049
Am I gonna be safe with him?

154
00:09:57,521 --> 00:09:59,022
(laughter)

155
00:10:06,296 --> 00:10:09,032
You're a grown man, Benjamin.
You're gonna be just fine.

156
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,701
(laughter)

157
00:10:10,934 --> 00:10:12,936
(dramatic music playing)

158
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:23,514
Nun: What?

159
00:10:27,618 --> 00:10:28,952
Well?

160
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,026
Mother Superior: Sisters,
get some clean laundry.

161
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,995
- (thunder crashes)
- (screaming)

162
00:10:38,162 --> 00:10:39,930
Mother Superior:
Hold her down, sisters!

163
00:10:40,364 --> 00:10:41,932
- Oh, my God!
- (evil laughing)

164
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:44,968
- (sisters screaming)
- (Agnes gnarling)

165
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:51,508
(birds chirping)

166
00:11:27,678 --> 00:11:30,614
What draws so many
young men to the priesthood,

167
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:32,382
not so much nowadays,

168
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:34,886
is this beautiful vision
of service.

169
00:11:35,652 --> 00:11:37,521
- Yeah.
- I mean, don't get me wrong,

170
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:39,289
it is a beautiful vision,
but it needs to be more

171
00:11:39,423 --> 00:11:41,024
- than that.
- I know, you told me about this

172
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,659
in class, remember?
I know all this already.

173
00:11:42,793 --> 00:11:45,762
I just wanna be sure this
comes from your heart of hearts,

174
00:11:45,897 --> 00:11:48,499
not from some idea
of how to live a good life

175
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:50,167
because you don't know
what you want.

176
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,837
Or... or you're compensating
for something.

177
00:11:52,971 --> 00:11:54,371
Or you're scared of life.

178
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,975
There are plenty of ways
to live a good, meaningful life.

179
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:58,575
I'm not scared of life.

180
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:04,081
I've searched my heart,
and it says become a priest.

181
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,352
That seems courageous to me.

182
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,355
- I pray about it a lot.
- Okay, then.

183
00:12:16,593 --> 00:12:18,495
- Benjamin: Do you regret it?
- No.

184
00:12:19,964 --> 00:12:22,065
I don't, but... but it's tough.

185
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,803
And this is really personal,
but what about chastity?

186
00:12:26,503 --> 00:12:28,505
- Benjamin: What about it?
- Don't you want to get a job,

187
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,942
make some money,
meet the nice girl

188
00:12:31,074 --> 00:12:32,576
(growls) or guy?

189
00:12:32,743 --> 00:12:34,778
That'd be okay, too. I don't
know what you're into.

190
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:37,414
I'm not into anything.
I'm taking a vow of chastity.

191
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:44,621
Pancakes and sausage
with a side of syrup.

192
00:12:52,864 --> 00:12:56,300
At the very least, know thyself
before you jump into this.

193
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:58,201
You got this
or you want me to do it?

194
00:12:58,335 --> 00:12:59,703
Father Donaghue: Go for it.

195
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:04,708
Bless us, O Lord
and these thy gifts,

196
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:07,477
which we are about
to receive from thy bounty.

197
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,514
Through Christ, our Lord. Amen.

198
00:13:12,282 --> 00:13:13,383
So...

199
00:13:13,952 --> 00:13:15,586
what do you know about exorcism?

200
00:13:16,353 --> 00:13:17,654
Benjamin: Not much.

201
00:13:18,722 --> 00:13:20,490
I know that
it's still a holy rite,

202
00:13:20,624 --> 00:13:22,593
even though the church doesn't
really practice it anymore.

203
00:13:22,726 --> 00:13:23,861
Wrong.

204
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:26,363
They do.
They just don't claim it.

205
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,699
It's all very hush, hush.

206
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:31,668
(ominous music playing)

207
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:33,537
- Thanks for telling me.
- Even if,

208
00:13:35,405 --> 00:13:38,375
in our current age,
less people believe in God,

209
00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:42,346
it seems that belief
in the devil is rising.

210
00:13:44,015 --> 00:13:46,383
Maybe that means
he's winning, I don't know.

211
00:13:46,818 --> 00:13:49,753
It seems to me that people
are just in more pain.

212
00:13:49,887 --> 00:13:50,955
Good. Yes.

213
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,223
They are.
And they don't know why.

214
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:58,195
So they clutch at whatever
reason they can find.

215
00:13:59,097 --> 00:14:02,499
Look, I've performed exorcisms,

216
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,069
five or six full ones,
with Father Rigazzi,

217
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:07,038
who really knew the rite.

218
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,539
But I never saw anything
that convinced me

219
00:14:09,673 --> 00:14:12,609
a demon was actually
inside someone.

220
00:14:13,443 --> 00:14:16,380
But I do know
the exorcisms worked.

221
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,548
The power of faith.

222
00:14:20,084 --> 00:14:22,719
Maybe, people needed to get sick

223
00:14:22,854 --> 00:14:26,858
to some other worldly
or unimaginable degree

224
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:31,461
and could only get well
when a priest forgave them,

225
00:14:32,195 --> 00:14:35,933
someone ordained by God.

226
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:38,903
Hmm, maybe...

227
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,107
some people just need
to walk through darkness

228
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,175
before they even
get to the light, as...

229
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,511
as cliché as that sounds.

230
00:14:48,311 --> 00:14:50,313
You don't believe in demons?

231
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,824
I'm afraid the answer is no.

232
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:03,127
Mother Superior:
<i>Our a way of life</i>

233
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,594
<i>is no doubt hard.</i>

234
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:10,467
<i>It demands rigor, discipline
and strength of spirit.</i>

235
00:15:11,435 --> 00:15:13,737
<i>But, most of all,
the purity of heart.</i>

236
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,306
But sometimes we falter.

237
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,309
Now, understand that I have
sought the Lord's guidance

238
00:15:19,443 --> 00:15:22,080
and deliberated hard
over this decision.

239
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:26,984
Two days ago, I requested
help from the diocese.

240
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:30,520
A priest with experience
in such matters,

241
00:15:30,654 --> 00:15:32,890
a true man of God
with the highest of reputations

242
00:15:33,024 --> 00:15:34,926
is now on his way to us.

243
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,460
We will host him

244
00:15:36,793 --> 00:15:40,198
until he decides what
must be done with Sister Agnes.

245
00:15:40,764 --> 00:15:42,867
I'm told
he will arrive this evening.

246
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,903
Now, it goes without saying
that I expect conduct

247
00:15:46,037 --> 00:15:48,305
of the highest standard
during this time.

248
00:15:48,705 --> 00:15:50,440
Remember who you are, sisters.

249
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,044
We are not accustomed
to admitting men

250
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:55,146
within our walls, even holy men.

251
00:15:55,512 --> 00:15:57,280
So let every action

252
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,582
reflect the dignity

253
00:15:58,782 --> 00:16:01,284
of your solemn vow
before Almighty God.

254
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,756
- May I ask a question, Mother?
- Mother Superior: You may not.

255
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,591
If you have concerns,
you may seek my counsel

256
00:16:07,724 --> 00:16:09,026
after our duties are finished.

257
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,162
We will spend the rest
of the day cleaning

258
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:13,597
before Father Donaghue arrives.

259
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:15,833
Sister Mary,

260
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,736
youngest in Christ
and lowliest among us,

261
00:16:20,504 --> 00:16:22,907
I'm told you were friends
with Sister Agnes?

262
00:16:23,074 --> 00:16:24,142
Sister Mary: Yes.

263
00:16:24,307 --> 00:16:25,475
Mother Superior:
Then your hands

264
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,544
must be idle least of all.

265
00:16:28,478 --> 00:16:31,481
You will clean the chapel
from floor to ceiling,

266
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,018
removing every mote of dust.

267
00:16:35,052 --> 00:16:38,555
It's likely Father Donaghue
will serve mass while he's here.

268
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:40,958
Yes, Mother.

269
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:55,505
Father Donaghue:
Here, put this on.

270
00:16:58,876 --> 00:17:01,311
- Oh, I can't wear this.
- Father Donaghue: Why not?

271
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,613
I'm not a priest.

272
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:06,150
You said at lunch
your vows are all but taken.

273
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,985
Yeah,
but I haven't taken them yet.

274
00:17:08,186 --> 00:17:10,855
This is gonna cause
problems in there.

275
00:17:13,024 --> 00:17:15,492
Look, sorry, Father Donaghue,
there's just no way.

276
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:19,997
Suit yourself.
Don't say I didn't tell you.

277
00:17:22,732 --> 00:17:24,367
(car doors close)

278
00:17:34,544 --> 00:17:36,646
I saw Father Donaghue
give mass once

279
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,415
before the sisterhood.

280
00:17:39,116 --> 00:17:40,985
It was inspiring.

281
00:17:41,718 --> 00:17:43,486
Nun: Who's that
supposed to be, his driver?

282
00:17:43,653 --> 00:17:45,022
Whoever he is, he's handsome.

283
00:17:45,156 --> 00:17:46,756
Sister, you need
\ to contain yourself.

284
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:49,359
I'm sorry, but he looks
like a movie star.

285
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,428
And Father Donaghue
isn't bad, either.

286
00:17:51,595 --> 00:17:53,396
- Nun: Sister Honey!
- What?

287
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:56,600
We can't even talk about it?
I don't see the problem.

288
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:58,735
It's not like I'm going
to go up to him and say,

289
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,470
- "Oh, Father, I..."
- Nun: Sister!

290
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,405
The younger one
is wearing all black,

291
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,707
but no priest color.

292
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:05,508
Nun: He's probably a deacon.

293
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:08,678
(dramatic music playing)

294
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:11,481
(brush scrubbing)

295
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:29,033
(suspenseful music playing)

296
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:34,272
I must say, I wish I was told

297
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,773
your young companion
would be accompanying you.

298
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:40,344
I find it inappropriate.
Almost insulting.

299
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,180
I'm sorry,
Mother Superior, I assumed

300
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:45,349
- the vicar general...
- Of course, Father Benoit

301
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:47,417
visits us for mass
three times a week,

302
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,753
but he's 77 years old.

303
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,423
It's unusual enough to have
a priest stay overnight,

304
00:18:53,556 --> 00:18:55,092
let alone this young man.

305
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,161
Again, my apologies Mother.

306
00:18:57,527 --> 00:18:59,830
But he is a very pious
young man.

307
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,933
And I assure you,

308
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:05,202
he is absolutely essential
for my work here.

309
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,570
Then I assume
we should look at this

310
00:19:07,704 --> 00:19:09,807
as a test of faith
for all of us.

311
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:14,946
Benjamin, Mother Superior
is concerned... (smacks lips)

312
00:19:15,712 --> 00:19:16,981
How should I put this,

313
00:19:17,315 --> 00:19:19,749
about having a young
unordained rooster

314
00:19:19,884 --> 00:19:21,518
loose in the hen house.

315
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:23,586
Father, there's no need
to be crude.

316
00:19:28,426 --> 00:19:30,928
Mother Superior, I'm taking
my vows later this year.

317
00:19:31,162 --> 00:19:34,432
I absolutely assure you, with
Christ himself as my witness,

318
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,499
I will remain a model
of propriety

319
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,903
as long as you are kind
enough to host me.

320
00:19:41,105 --> 00:19:45,176
Well, I'll expect so,
and we'll insist upon it.

321
00:19:46,377 --> 00:19:48,578
(cart rattling)

322
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:56,686
This is Sister Ruth.
This is Sister Honey.

323
00:19:57,088 --> 00:19:58,889
- Thank you, Mother.
- Father Donaghue: Honey?

324
00:19:59,723 --> 00:20:01,558
I... I believe it's Proverbs.

325
00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:05,628
"My son, eat the honey,
for it is good.

326
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,299
And the drippings
of the honeycomb

327
00:20:08,432 --> 00:20:09,766
are sweet to the taste."

328
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,470
(chuckling)
Oh, my God, stop.

329
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,637
Sister, that's enough.
Leave them be.

330
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:17,041
Have Sister Mary
take their dirty things

331
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,509
- when they're through.
- Yes, Mother.

332
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:25,850
And afterward, we should do
what we came here to do.

333
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,617
The sooner, the better.

334
00:20:27,818 --> 00:20:30,187
Mother, forgive me,
one last thing.

335
00:20:30,821 --> 00:20:33,523
Do you happen to have any wine?

336
00:20:34,724 --> 00:20:36,327
"And they said of him,

337
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:40,364
'He casts out devils
by the power of the devil.'"

338
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:41,999
Careful, Mother.

339
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,603
In that passage, the Pharisees
are talking about our Lord.

340
00:20:47,171 --> 00:20:48,239
Humph.

341
00:20:50,975 --> 00:20:52,209
I thought you said
you were interested

342
00:20:52,343 --> 00:20:53,511
in this going smoothly.

343
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,579
We'll be in and out
of here anyway.

344
00:20:57,348 --> 00:21:00,484
The inflicted sister probably
just needs some priest

345
00:21:00,617 --> 00:21:03,087
to come and say the magic words.

346
00:21:04,021 --> 00:21:06,790
Don't worry. I've seen this
more than a few times.

347
00:21:11,628 --> 00:21:13,130
(suspenseful music playing)

348
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,465
(rattling)

349
00:21:14,697 --> 00:21:16,200
(water splashing)

350
00:21:21,771 --> 00:21:23,307
(dishes shattering)

351
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,516
- (knocking on door)
- Mother Superior: What?

352
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,285
It's Father Donaghue.

353
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,389
It's not appropriate
for you to be here.

354
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:40,623
But I imagine you knew that.

355
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,026
Forgive me, Mother.

356
00:21:42,226 --> 00:21:45,229
I wanted to apologize
for my behavior.

357
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,932
It was a long trip today.

358
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:50,901
And I'm not accustomed
to your way of life out here.

359
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:54,371
I wasn't thinking,
and I should've known better.

360
00:21:54,505 --> 00:21:55,772
You should have.

361
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:59,243
I'm afraid I'm more used
to dealing with lay people.

362
00:22:00,044 --> 00:22:02,880
Sometimes I joke with them.

363
00:22:03,514 --> 00:22:05,416
It puts them at ease.

364
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:10,221
But here I should conduct
myself with more respect,

365
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:12,823
especially toward you.

366
00:22:14,191 --> 00:22:18,095
Well, then I must forgive you.

367
00:22:20,431 --> 00:22:21,832
My temper is...

368
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:25,002
It's been quite
a stressful time.

369
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:29,273
May the Holy Spirit
guide us both.

370
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:36,247
Now, shall we go see
about your poor lost lamb?

371
00:22:38,182 --> 00:22:41,385
(suspenseful music playing)

372
00:22:47,057 --> 00:22:50,995
(crackling music playing)

373
00:23:29,133 --> 00:23:31,802
Has she spoken at all
in any ancient languages?

374
00:23:31,969 --> 00:23:33,837
- No, Father.
- Has she said anything

375
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:36,540
about any of you
she couldn't possibly know?

376
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:39,043
Secrets or private details,

377
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,778
particularly those things
from before you took your vows?

378
00:23:41,946 --> 00:23:43,247
Of course not.

379
00:23:44,448 --> 00:23:45,950
Likely all will be well.

380
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,751
Follow my lead as we discussed.

381
00:23:49,453 --> 00:23:52,489
If you become afraid,
you can't let it show.

382
00:23:53,123 --> 00:23:56,327
You have to be strong,
but fill your hearts with love.

383
00:23:57,361 --> 00:24:00,998
If you see anything strange,
stick to the script.

384
00:24:04,435 --> 00:24:06,103
You tied her up?
You treat someone

385
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:07,938
like an animal,
they'll act like an animal.

386
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,907
Mother Superior: The poor girl
injured herself.

387
00:24:10,174 --> 00:24:11,942
Oh. What's her name?

388
00:24:12,176 --> 00:24:14,511
Mother Superior: Agnes.
Sister Agnes.

389
00:24:15,145 --> 00:24:18,882
Sister Agnes, can you hear me?

390
00:24:19,717 --> 00:24:21,318
Can you feel me near you?

391
00:24:22,152 --> 00:24:24,021
(dramatic music playing)

392
00:24:25,022 --> 00:24:27,925
This looks bad,
but maybe not that bad.

393
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,394
Benjamin, the holy water.

394
00:24:38,702 --> 00:24:40,037
(growls)

395
00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:44,541
Well, let's begin.

396
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:51,915
- Lord, have mercy.
- All: Lord, have mercy.

397
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:53,917
Christ, have mercy.

398
00:24:54,218 --> 00:24:56,920
- All: Christ, have mercy.
- Fuck you.

399
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,658
Lord, have mercy.

400
00:25:00,824 --> 00:25:02,326
All: Lord, have mercy.

401
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,927
Christ, have mercy.

402
00:25:04,194 --> 00:25:06,096
All: Christ, have mercy.

403
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,332
Father Donaghue: Begone, you.

404
00:25:09,066 --> 00:25:11,201
Begone, seducer.

405
00:25:12,036 --> 00:25:14,104
Your place is in solitude.

406
00:25:14,772 --> 00:25:17,875
Your abode
is the nest of serpents.

407
00:25:18,008 --> 00:25:20,811
Get down and crawl with them.

408
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:27,484
You might delude man,
but God cannot be mocked.

409
00:25:27,618 --> 00:25:29,887
Go to hell, cocksucker.

410
00:25:34,858 --> 00:25:37,461
It is He who cast you out,

411
00:25:38,195 --> 00:25:41,498
from whose sight
nothing is hidden.

412
00:25:41,732 --> 00:25:44,501
It is He who repels you,

413
00:25:45,402 --> 00:25:49,707
to whose might
all things are subject.

414
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,776
Many things. Many things.

415
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:56,213
Father Donaghue:
Is He who expels you.

416
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,217
He who has everlasting fire.

417
00:26:00,384 --> 00:26:04,521
(interposing voices
and music playing)

418
00:26:09,927 --> 00:26:14,465
In the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

419
00:26:14,598 --> 00:26:15,966
All: Amen.

420
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:23,640
Mother Superior: Oh,
dear sweet sister.

421
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,911
That was dramatic.

422
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:31,915
It has to be.

423
00:26:34,084 --> 00:26:35,519
It's an exorcism,

424
00:26:36,821 --> 00:26:39,623
one of the most elaborate
song and dance acts

425
00:26:39,757 --> 00:26:41,024
the world has ever seen.

426
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,926
So, that was all in her head?

427
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,695
More or less.

428
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:48,867
Look, the Carmelites
here in Santa Teresa

429
00:26:48,999 --> 00:26:52,636
belong to an entirely
enclosed order.

430
00:26:53,137 --> 00:26:54,271
In some ways,

431
00:26:54,538 --> 00:26:56,273
they're more a relic
of the old church

432
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,475
than even exorcism itself.

433
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,445
- Yeah, but if they...
- That's enough heaven

434
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:04,615
and hell for one night,
Benjamin, let's get some sleep.

435
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,117
I'm knackered.

436
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:14,224
(birds chirping)

437
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:21,031
<i>God sees the truth...</i>

438
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:24,001
but waits.

439
00:27:25,202 --> 00:27:27,671
Over 100 years ago,
Leo Tolstoy

440
00:27:28,038 --> 00:27:30,107
wrote a story with that title.

441
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,076
And it has always stuck with me.

442
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:37,916
I find that so many of us
who devote our lives to God

443
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:39,483
through our vows,

444
00:27:40,184 --> 00:27:43,387
spend a great deal
of time waiting.

445
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,256
Waiting on God.

446
00:27:46,825 --> 00:27:48,625
It can be so easy

447
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:53,997
to fall into despair
in this fallen world.

448
00:27:54,431 --> 00:27:58,569
How could we know this gift,

449
00:27:59,002 --> 00:28:01,605
the glory of salvation,

450
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,309
of finding our way to Christ,

451
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:09,413
if at first we did not wander?

452
00:28:10,949 --> 00:28:14,785
How could we ever
truly appreciate

453
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:18,989
the miracle of redemption
and grace

454
00:28:19,456 --> 00:28:23,594
if we'd not suffered tribulation
and come to darkness?

455
00:28:24,695 --> 00:28:28,532
I haven't met all of you,
but the Mother Superior

456
00:28:28,765 --> 00:28:32,369
tells me that you are a pious
and devoted bunch.

457
00:28:32,904 --> 00:28:36,473
And I am truly grateful
for the hospitality

458
00:28:36,607 --> 00:28:39,209
that you've shown us
during this time of trial,

459
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:43,815
to me and my strapping
young buck of a companion.

460
00:28:43,948 --> 00:28:45,850
Isn't he handsome, ladies?

461
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,252
But there is one among you

462
00:28:48,987 --> 00:28:52,322
who I am most pleased
to have become acquainted with,

463
00:28:53,123 --> 00:28:58,161
one who has suffered much,
walking through a darkness

464
00:28:58,295 --> 00:29:01,565
that most of us
cannot even imagine,

465
00:29:02,332 --> 00:29:07,738
one who has endured
a true test of faith.

466
00:29:08,639 --> 00:29:11,475
God sees the truth, but waits.

467
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:17,080
And he can always see a heart
that is fundamentally pure,

468
00:29:17,815 --> 00:29:20,651
as I know hers is.

469
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:23,487
Okay, Sister Honey.

470
00:29:27,257 --> 00:29:30,260
(dramatic music playing)

471
00:29:46,143 --> 00:29:47,678
What say you, dear sister,

472
00:29:48,445 --> 00:29:51,615
are you ready to join us
in the Lord's sacrament?

473
00:29:56,219 --> 00:29:57,421
We must be patient.

474
00:29:57,822 --> 00:30:00,290
Understandably, our dear sister
will take some time

475
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,060
to return to her former self.

476
00:30:02,693 --> 00:30:06,396
Well, aren't you just
the sweetest old liar?

477
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:08,398
What?

478
00:30:11,002 --> 00:30:12,502
(laughs)

479
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,348
(Sister Agnes sighs)

480
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,684
(dramatic music playing)

481
00:30:34,391 --> 00:30:37,127
(in child tone) Father Frank,
he touched my wee-wee.

482
00:30:37,327 --> 00:30:40,731
Father Frank,
he touched my wee-wee!

483
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,734
(growls)

484
00:30:43,935 --> 00:30:46,403
(all scream)

485
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,079
So, should we call the diocese?

486
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:56,613
Absolutely not.

487
00:30:56,914 --> 00:30:58,950
- Well, the rite didn't work.
- You've made this worse

488
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:00,684
- by your pride.
- Obviously,

489
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:04,254
that was not my doing, Mother.
It ambushed us.

490
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:05,789
So, it's an it now?

491
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,993
What she said about the child,
how could she know that?

492
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:11,194
I thought everybody
knew about that.

493
00:31:11,528 --> 00:31:14,431
I have never seen anything
like this before in my life.

494
00:31:14,598 --> 00:31:16,767
I thought you were
supposed to be the expert.

495
00:31:17,567 --> 00:31:19,770
They were setting me up to fail.

496
00:31:20,237 --> 00:31:21,906
- Sister!
- I'm sorry, Mother.

497
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,808
We have to call the diocese.

498
00:31:23,941 --> 00:31:28,278
You don't want that kind
of attention here right now.

499
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,449
And it's not needed. I know
someone who can help us.

500
00:31:32,582 --> 00:31:35,752
- We served in Rome.
- You mean a priest?

501
00:31:37,788 --> 00:31:38,956
Kind of.

502
00:31:39,322 --> 00:31:42,325
(dramatic music playing)

503
00:31:43,627 --> 00:31:45,796
Cross Talk with Guy Chesterton.

504
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:49,299
No matter
your religious beliefs,

505
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:51,401
you're probably familiar
with the old adage

506
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:53,370
giving the devil his due.

507
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,906
Well, our guest this evening

508
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,141
can be said to have done
all that and more,

509
00:31:57,407 --> 00:31:59,342
tracing an unlikely career path

510
00:31:59,476 --> 00:32:01,645
through decades
of macabre service,

511
00:32:01,778 --> 00:32:05,248
casting out alleged demons,
possibly saving souls,

512
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,952
and becoming a household
name in the process.

513
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:10,554
We're pleased to welcome
Father Henry Black

514
00:32:10,687 --> 00:32:12,824
in the studio with us
this evening.

515
00:32:13,757 --> 00:32:16,460
- Welcome, Father Black.
- Well, thank you, Guy,

516
00:32:16,626 --> 00:32:18,963
that was quite an introduction.
It's good to be with you.

517
00:32:19,097 --> 00:32:21,331
Now, your methods are said
to be quite different

518
00:32:21,465 --> 00:32:22,699
from the Catholic church,

519
00:32:23,034 --> 00:32:25,368
not to mention from the way
we've seen exorcism

520
00:32:25,502 --> 00:32:27,939
represented in the media
and on films.

521
00:32:28,538 --> 00:32:29,841
It's true
you were ex-communicated

522
00:32:29,974 --> 00:32:31,909
from the Church
over 17 years ago.

523
00:32:32,043 --> 00:32:33,878
Never looked back. Hmm.

524
00:32:34,678 --> 00:32:38,182
Now, I'm sure they miss me just
about as much as I miss them.

525
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:39,851
Let's go back
to the beginning.

526
00:32:40,051 --> 00:32:43,054
When did you learn you had
a talent for this kind of thing?

527
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:44,889
When I was a child,

528
00:32:45,223 --> 00:32:49,392
my little sister was possessed
by a demon named Bune.

529
00:32:49,961 --> 00:32:53,430
You were involved in exorcisms
from a very early age.

530
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:57,434
No, Bune,
he was a stubborn demon.

531
00:32:58,502 --> 00:32:59,871
He wouldn't get out.

532
00:33:00,737 --> 00:33:04,307
So, you're saying
a demon named Bune

533
00:33:04,474 --> 00:33:07,044
infiltrated your sister's body
years ago,

534
00:33:07,178 --> 00:33:10,047
and to this day
resides in your family's home?

535
00:33:10,248 --> 00:33:12,582
- Father Black: Correct.
- And all this can be verified?

536
00:33:12,716 --> 00:33:14,819
It took some getting used to.
But growing up,

537
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:18,990
I was forced to adapt
to the ways of the demon Bune.

538
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:23,961
I grew accustomed to interacting
with him on a daily basis.

539
00:33:24,694 --> 00:33:26,530
So, by the time I got my collar,

540
00:33:26,763 --> 00:33:28,900
I already had all
the know-how I needed

541
00:33:29,033 --> 00:33:31,468
to exorcise anything
you put in front of me.

542
00:33:31,601 --> 00:33:33,637
And yet,
with all your experience,

543
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:37,307
you were never able
to exercise the demon Bune

544
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,812
- from your sister.
- It's complicated, Guy.

545
00:33:41,545 --> 00:33:44,381
I mean, the family,
at this point,

546
00:33:44,514 --> 00:33:47,717
had become so familiar
with Bune.

547
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:51,421
He still lives with my family,
still eats at the table,

548
00:33:51,621 --> 00:33:54,992
still sleeps in what used
to be my sister's room,

549
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:57,527
family vacations and whatnot.

550
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:58,963
His favorite color is green.

551
00:33:59,096 --> 00:34:01,899
His favorite dessert
is lemon chiffon cake.

552
00:34:02,033 --> 00:34:03,901
What do you say
to those who claim

553
00:34:04,035 --> 00:34:07,337
you're simply exploiting
the families you visit

554
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,773
and capitalizing
on the mental illness

555
00:34:09,907 --> 00:34:11,641
of the so-called possessed?

556
00:34:11,976 --> 00:34:15,512
(sighs) Let me put it
to you this way, Guy.

557
00:34:16,881 --> 00:34:19,016
I didn't choose
this line of work.

558
00:34:19,616 --> 00:34:20,885
It chose me.

559
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,453
God chose me.

560
00:34:24,554 --> 00:34:28,625
He put me on a path of darkness.
He put a demon

561
00:34:28,893 --> 00:34:32,897
by my side and said,
"Be not afraid, my son."

562
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:37,367
We'll be right back.

563
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:40,570
(dramatic music playing)

564
00:34:44,175 --> 00:34:46,743
- (dog barking)
- (crickets chirping)

565
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:52,817
She's given herself
over to the devil.

566
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,451
She needs medical attention.

567
00:34:54,584 --> 00:34:57,387
Sisters, you forget yourselves.

568
00:34:57,654 --> 00:34:59,190
As if we don't have
enough to do.

569
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,325
Sister Honey,
find out if Father Donaghue

570
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:04,394
has stopped bleeding. If so,
clean and dress his wound.

571
00:35:04,527 --> 00:35:05,695
Yes, Mother Superior.

572
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,564
You two,
finish cleaning the filth

573
00:35:07,697 --> 00:35:09,799
that Agnes has trailed
from the chapel. Go.

574
00:35:09,934 --> 00:35:11,768
You, prepare a light meal

575
00:35:11,903 --> 00:35:13,170
to be served to the rest
of the sisters

576
00:35:13,304 --> 00:35:15,639
in half an hour.
We will gather our strength,

577
00:35:15,772 --> 00:35:17,942
after which
we will retire to our rooms

578
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:19,643
and we will pray
for the rest of the evening.

579
00:35:19,776 --> 00:35:21,913
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, Mother.

580
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,117
Sister Mary, Sister Ruth,
she's quiet, yes?

581
00:35:26,384 --> 00:35:29,619
She hasn't stirred since
the straps or the holy water.

582
00:35:31,055 --> 00:35:32,023
Then go.

583
00:35:32,722 --> 00:35:33,991
Sister Mary,

584
00:35:34,691 --> 00:35:36,526
since you two
were thick as thieves,

585
00:35:36,827 --> 00:35:38,262
you will attend Agnes,

586
00:35:38,863 --> 00:35:40,430
or whatever holy
remains in her.

587
00:35:40,563 --> 00:35:42,133
We might still call her
by that name.

588
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,600
I can't see her.

589
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,873
You're frightened, child?

590
00:35:50,074 --> 00:35:53,144
You don't have the luxury
to be frightened.

591
00:35:55,578 --> 00:35:58,215
- Yes, Mother.
- And mind,

592
00:35:59,749 --> 00:36:03,687
if she speaks evil,
don't listen.

593
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,698
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

594
00:36:14,832 --> 00:36:16,100
- Blessed art thou among women.
- (doors slamming)

595
00:36:16,233 --> 00:36:17,835
And blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

596
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:19,602
Holy Mary, Mother of
God, pray for us sinners

597
00:36:19,736 --> 00:36:21,105
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

598
00:36:21,238 --> 00:36:22,840
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

599
00:36:22,974 --> 00:36:24,241
Blessed art thou among women.

600
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:25,943
And blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

601
00:36:26,077 --> 00:36:27,510
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners

602
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:28,980
now and at the hour
f our death, amen.

603
00:36:29,113 --> 00:36:30,815
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

604
00:36:30,948 --> 00:36:32,283
Blessed art thou among women.
And blessed is the fruit

605
00:36:32,416 --> 00:36:33,985
- of thy womb, Jesus.
- Sister Agnes: Mary!

606
00:36:34,251 --> 00:36:35,853
- Holy Mary, Mother of God...
- Sister Agnes: Go home!

607
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,520
...pray for us sinners, now and
at the hour of our death, amen.

608
00:36:37,721 --> 00:36:39,290
- Hail Mary full of grace...
- Praise Jesus!

609
00:36:39,457 --> 00:36:40,925
- Blessed is the fruit of thy...
- (Agnes speaks indistinctly)

610
00:36:41,058 --> 00:36:42,525
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us

611
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,028
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

612
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:45,997
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
please pray for me.

613
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:49,599
(demonic voices
drown out praying)

614
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:05,515
Hey, Mary.

615
00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:09,954
Hey, Agnes.

616
00:37:26,837 --> 00:37:28,738
Are you afraid of me?

617
00:37:32,309 --> 00:37:34,544
You bit off
Father Donaghue's nose.

618
00:37:36,013 --> 00:37:37,948
Well, he had a nice nose.

619
00:37:38,315 --> 00:37:39,316
(giggles)

620
00:37:54,999 --> 00:37:59,336
I wish I'd said goodbye
to everyone before I left,

621
00:38:01,372 --> 00:38:03,074
told them how much I loved them.

622
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,778
But I guess
that doesn't matter now.

623
00:38:12,817 --> 00:38:14,717
Aren't you uncomfortable?

624
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:18,289
What do you mean?

625
00:38:19,656 --> 00:38:21,624
Come on, take that shit off.

626
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,830
(gentle music playing)

627
00:38:45,049 --> 00:38:46,716
There, isn't that better?

628
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:53,958
You and I have never
really been honest

629
00:38:54,091 --> 00:38:55,692
with each other, have we?

630
00:38:59,597 --> 00:39:00,898
You lost someone.

631
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,735
- Yeah.
- I lost someone, too.

632
00:39:06,703 --> 00:39:08,239
The love of my life.

633
00:39:09,706 --> 00:39:11,175
He was my teacher.

634
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:16,247
He could make me laugh
like no one else could.

635
00:39:17,915 --> 00:39:21,152
But I was stupid and I lost him.

636
00:39:23,521 --> 00:39:24,855
Paul Satchimo.

637
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,126
You loved him?

638
00:39:29,894 --> 00:39:31,728
And he loved me.

639
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:35,665
You lost your son.

640
00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:40,070
The only person I ever loved.

641
00:39:42,606 --> 00:39:44,842
You have to bury the dead, Mary.

642
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,013
(ominous music playing)

643
00:39:53,817 --> 00:39:57,687
(coughs and chokes)

644
00:40:02,393 --> 00:40:03,928
I'll always be with you.

645
00:40:12,036 --> 00:40:14,505
Mother Superior: I beseech you
now for guidance, Lord,

646
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:16,739
you whose righteousness
has always breathed

647
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:19,643
through this convent
like the sweetest song.

648
00:40:20,277 --> 00:40:22,680
How is this wretchedness
come to pass upon us?

649
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,015
Is my service
not pleasing to you?

650
00:40:25,182 --> 00:40:26,550
- (knocking on door)
- What?

651
00:40:27,351 --> 00:40:29,620
- What's it?
- I'm sorry, Mother.

652
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,589
For a great many things,
I'm sure.

653
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,157
I think you should go see Agnes.

654
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:35,092
What are you talking about?
The devil is in her.

655
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:36,660
Has it gotten into you as well?

656
00:40:36,793 --> 00:40:40,364
I don't think it's the devil.
She was kind to me.

657
00:40:40,598 --> 00:40:42,666
The devil leads with kindness.

658
00:40:42,799 --> 00:40:44,335
And why are you not presentable?

659
00:40:44,468 --> 00:40:47,404
There are men
in this house, you slut. Leave!

660
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:49,106
(door slams shut)

661
00:40:51,308 --> 00:40:53,978
(gentle piano music playing)

662
00:41:08,659 --> 00:41:10,394
Do you want me to pray with you?

663
00:41:11,161 --> 00:41:15,966
No, Benjamin, just
leave me to the wolves.

664
00:41:17,835 --> 00:41:22,339
Maybe a priest without a nose
won't seem so strange in...

665
00:41:23,474 --> 00:41:26,310
Vietnam or Croatia
or wherever the hell it is

666
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:29,380
- they're gonna be sending me.
- That's it, think positive.

667
00:41:29,713 --> 00:41:34,018
I am thinking positive.
I'm positively fucked.

668
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:39,089
(chokes) Yeah.

669
00:41:40,524 --> 00:41:44,028
Father Black
will be here in the morning.

670
00:41:45,896 --> 00:41:47,831
Well,
that should be interesting.

671
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:51,101
(sobbing) I am fucked.

672
00:41:52,936 --> 00:41:56,974
I am fucked,
I'm fucked, I'm fucked.

673
00:42:01,045 --> 00:42:03,013
(birds chirping)

674
00:42:05,049 --> 00:42:08,519
(gently dramatic music playing)

675
00:42:28,138 --> 00:42:29,606
(doorbell rings)

676
00:42:37,414 --> 00:42:38,482
Frank.

677
00:42:42,186 --> 00:42:43,554
Good to see you again.

678
00:42:43,787 --> 00:42:44,955
So what happened there, Frank,

679
00:42:45,089 --> 00:42:46,390
somebody spite your face
a little bit?

680
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:49,026
Yeah, something like that.
Father Black,

681
00:42:49,326 --> 00:42:51,562
I would like to introduce you
to Benjamin,

682
00:42:51,695 --> 00:42:53,364
one of my best students.

683
00:42:54,064 --> 00:42:57,134
Father Henry Black
and his lovely assistant.

684
00:42:57,267 --> 00:42:58,936
I'm sorry,
I didn't catch your name.

685
00:42:59,503 --> 00:43:01,638
- I didn't disclose.
- Right.

686
00:43:01,905 --> 00:43:03,440
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

687
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,409
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

688
00:43:07,077 --> 00:43:08,445
- Who's this guy?
- I'm sorry.

689
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:10,314
We've been under
considerable stress

690
00:43:10,447 --> 00:43:12,049
in our current predicament.

691
00:43:12,182 --> 00:43:14,017
- Benjamin, if you...
- Mother Superior: Boy's right.

692
00:43:15,586 --> 00:43:18,823
This is not the sort of company
I'd ever allow in this convent,

693
00:43:18,989 --> 00:43:20,157
no matter what the circumstance.

694
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:22,393
You absolutely
cannot smoke here.

695
00:43:23,227 --> 00:43:27,064
You know, I can sense
when I'm not welcome, Frank.

696
00:43:27,197 --> 00:43:28,532
I appreciate the call

697
00:43:28,665 --> 00:43:30,134
- after so long, but...
- No, no, no, no.

698
00:43:30,267 --> 00:43:32,035
- Come on, let's...
- Please, Henry, please.

699
00:43:32,269 --> 00:43:37,107
The fact is that we are
in dire need of your expertise.

700
00:43:37,307 --> 00:43:38,843
That's probably true.

701
00:43:39,643 --> 00:43:45,249
Mother, you and the sisters
in your cherished convent

702
00:43:45,382 --> 00:43:47,584
have been the most
gracious hosts.

703
00:43:47,718 --> 00:43:49,052
But now I have a request.

704
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:51,121
Respectfully,
would you give it a rest?

705
00:43:51,255 --> 00:43:53,524
- Excuse me?
- Forgive us, Mother.

706
00:43:53,657 --> 00:43:56,260
- This is highly inappropriate.
- (chuckles) At this juncture,

707
00:43:56,393 --> 00:43:58,863
I don't see that you
have any other choice.

708
00:43:59,096 --> 00:44:02,332
Please escort us to Agnes

709
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:05,569
so that we can end
this dance once and for all.

710
00:44:05,702 --> 00:44:06,937
I most certainly will not.

711
00:44:07,104 --> 00:44:10,407
Very well, then.
If you will follow me,

712
00:44:10,574 --> 00:44:13,110
I would love to introduce you
to the poor girl,

713
00:44:13,277 --> 00:44:15,646
and you can commence your work.

714
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:20,651
Oh, what the hell?
I drove this far.

715
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,290
Mother Superior:
I'll be notifying the bishop.

716
00:44:31,161 --> 00:44:32,463
I am curious.

717
00:44:33,664 --> 00:44:35,332
(dramatic music playing)

718
00:44:39,736 --> 00:44:41,305
Hello there, Agnes.

719
00:44:41,806 --> 00:44:43,707
(hisses)

720
00:44:45,075 --> 00:44:47,311
Wow, shows some good instinct

721
00:44:48,378 --> 00:44:50,815
because I'm not your friend.

722
00:44:51,782 --> 00:44:54,351
I'm not your friend at all.
No, ma'am.

723
00:44:57,054 --> 00:44:58,455
Let me ask you something.

724
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:01,860
Do you feel like
you're welcome here?

725
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:04,027
Is that what's going on?

726
00:45:04,461 --> 00:45:09,032
You feel like you're welcome?
Because I've looked around.

727
00:45:10,133 --> 00:45:11,535
You're in a convent.

728
00:45:12,336 --> 00:45:15,072
So... so, you're not
welcome here.

729
00:45:15,739 --> 00:45:18,742
Which means that you and I,
well, we're gonna have to...

730
00:45:19,443 --> 00:45:21,345
have this little talk,
aren't we?

731
00:45:22,246 --> 00:45:23,680
You're a disgrace.

732
00:45:23,915 --> 00:45:26,283
Well, you can sweet
talk me all you want,

733
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:28,085
but I'm not scared.

734
00:45:28,218 --> 00:45:29,720
Fuck you, cocksucker.

735
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:33,323
Oh! Yeah, you can't bruise name
with your words, either.

736
00:45:33,457 --> 00:45:35,325
I've been to all nine
levels of hell and back.

737
00:45:35,459 --> 00:45:36,961
Hell wouldn't have you.

738
00:45:37,528 --> 00:45:40,230
Well, you see, that's...
that's where you're wrong

739
00:45:40,364 --> 00:45:44,768
because I have escorted
several there myself.

740
00:45:47,972 --> 00:45:49,606
(demonic laugh)

741
00:45:55,279 --> 00:45:57,347
I think
I'm starting to like you.

742
00:45:58,115 --> 00:46:00,083
Well that's, that's sweet.

743
00:46:01,351 --> 00:46:02,921
Let me tell you something.

744
00:46:03,153 --> 00:46:05,055
Come here,
let me tell you something.

745
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:09,459
I love you.

746
00:46:10,895 --> 00:46:12,529
You love me?

747
00:46:12,931 --> 00:46:15,566
I do. I love you.

748
00:46:17,134 --> 00:46:18,903
And you know who else loves you?

749
00:46:19,469 --> 00:46:20,771
Sister Agnes: No.

750
00:46:21,738 --> 00:46:24,741
- Jesus Christ! Get out, demon!
- Stop, no! No!

751
00:46:24,876 --> 00:46:27,377
- Time to go! You hear me?
- No, stop, please!

752
00:46:27,511 --> 00:46:29,079
- The power of Jesus Christ...
- I'm sorry!

753
00:46:29,212 --> 00:46:30,949
- ...our true Lord and Savior...
- No, no!

754
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:32,282
- ...compels you!
- No! No!

755
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:33,818
- And I say begone!
- I'm so sorry!

756
00:46:34,052 --> 00:46:37,521
- (yells indistinctly) Begone!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

757
00:46:37,654 --> 00:46:39,523
- This has to stop now!
- Just wait!

758
00:46:39,656 --> 00:46:43,861
Child of God, for it
is He who commands you!

759
00:46:43,995 --> 00:46:47,664
(whimpering) I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

760
00:46:47,798 --> 00:46:49,700
What just happened?
What just happened?

761
00:46:49,867 --> 00:46:53,270
It's all right, my child.
You're safe now.

762
00:46:53,537 --> 00:46:58,342
I don't understand, I...
I could... I could see, like,

763
00:46:59,343 --> 00:47:00,812
I could feel.

764
00:47:02,713 --> 00:47:04,816
It was like, it was like
I was another person.

765
00:47:04,949 --> 00:47:06,316
Yeah, well, you were,

766
00:47:06,483 --> 00:47:10,120
you were in the grips
of a creature most foul.

767
00:47:11,089 --> 00:47:12,756
But it's okay, you're safe now.

768
00:47:13,323 --> 00:47:14,625
You see, folks,

769
00:47:15,425 --> 00:47:17,561
that's the way
the cookie crumbles.

770
00:47:18,328 --> 00:47:21,531
You see, if you'd have let me
have my camera crew in here,

771
00:47:21,665 --> 00:47:23,634
we could've documented
some history.

772
00:47:23,767 --> 00:47:26,670
- Nice work, Henry.
- Thank you, Frank.

773
00:47:26,804 --> 00:47:28,705
Father Black, thank you.

774
00:47:28,906 --> 00:47:31,541
No, there's no need
to thank me.

775
00:47:31,976 --> 00:47:33,310
No, I want to thank you.

776
00:47:33,443 --> 00:47:35,479
But I have to tell you,
I'm afraid.

777
00:47:35,712 --> 00:47:38,315
Well, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

778
00:47:39,182 --> 00:47:40,617
Sister Agnes:
Maybe not for me.

779
00:47:41,218 --> 00:47:45,422
- Well, what do you mean?
- It's not me I'm afraid for.

780
00:47:47,324 --> 00:47:49,626
I don't understand.

781
00:47:51,929 --> 00:47:52,930
It's you.

782
00:47:55,499 --> 00:47:56,868
(Agnes yells)

783
00:47:57,567 --> 00:48:01,338
Oh, goddammit, son of a bitch!

784
00:48:01,672 --> 00:48:04,541
- (gasps in horror)
- Please, praise me! God!

785
00:48:04,741 --> 00:48:06,978
- (gasps in horror)
- Please, please! God!

786
00:48:07,111 --> 00:48:08,478
Somebody help me!

787
00:48:08,645 --> 00:48:10,114
Aren't you going
to do something?

788
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:13,450
- Father Black: Help!
- (vomits)

789
00:48:14,052 --> 00:48:15,652
(screaming)

790
00:48:19,023 --> 00:48:21,358
- (Agnes laughs demonically)
- Father Black: God damn you!

791
00:48:27,932 --> 00:48:29,934
(buzzing)

792
00:49:02,299 --> 00:49:05,569

Wanda: Yeah, we're good.

Hey, Wanda, do you know
if our paychecks are ready?

804
00:49:49,914 --> 00:49:52,749
Oh, I don't know. Go ask Curly.
He's in the back.

805
00:49:53,951 --> 00:49:55,519
- How are you doing?
- Man: All right.

806
00:49:55,652 --> 00:49:57,788
- Good.
- (knocking on door)

807
00:49:57,922 --> 00:49:58,990
Curly: Come.

808
00:50:03,861 --> 00:50:06,363
Hey, I was wondering if
my paycheck was ready yet?

809
00:50:06,496 --> 00:50:07,999
Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

810
00:50:09,066 --> 00:50:12,502
You're...
You're that new girl, huh?

811
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:14,839
What was your...
what was your name again?

812
00:50:14,972 --> 00:50:17,141
- I'm terrible with that stuff.
- It's okay. Uh, Mary.

813
00:50:17,275 --> 00:50:19,509
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary.

814
00:50:20,443 --> 00:50:22,412
Mary Jane, Mary Jane.

815
00:50:23,747 --> 00:50:25,515
There we go, I got you.

816
00:50:26,449 --> 00:50:28,252
All right, here, there you go.

817
00:50:28,418 --> 00:50:29,686
- Thank you, sir.
- Curly: Yeah.

818
00:50:29,821 --> 00:50:31,788
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
You just call me...

819
00:50:32,556 --> 00:50:34,591
call me Curly, all right?

820
00:50:35,193 --> 00:50:36,260
Today your day off?

821
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,461
Yeah, I'm working
a double tomorrow.

822
00:50:38,628 --> 00:50:41,032
Oh, nice.
Well, you enjoy your day.

823
00:50:42,666 --> 00:50:43,800
Yeah, you too.

824
00:50:43,935 --> 00:50:45,535
Curly: Used to be a nun, huh?

825
00:50:46,804 --> 00:50:49,472
- Yeah, I was.
- Golly.

826
00:50:50,875 --> 00:50:52,676
I've always wanted
to meet a nun.

827
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:55,847
Well, I'm sure I've met
enough for the both of us.

828
00:50:56,513 --> 00:50:58,883
(Curly laughs)

829
00:50:59,884 --> 00:51:02,954
I bet you have.
I bet you have. That's good.

830
00:51:03,486 --> 00:51:04,688
That's good.

831
00:51:05,923 --> 00:51:07,657
Hey, listen,
I'll be the first tell you

832
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:09,626
that I don't for fraternizing
with the employees here,

833
00:51:09,759 --> 00:51:11,162
but since you're new in town,

834
00:51:11,295 --> 00:51:13,496
if you ever wanted to, you know.

835
00:51:15,365 --> 00:51:17,467
I'm out and about a lot.

836
00:51:17,734 --> 00:51:21,705
I don't know if you like
to drink or if you like wine.

837
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,076
I like wine. (chuckles)

838
00:51:27,744 --> 00:51:29,814
I like...
I like other stuff, too.

839
00:51:33,851 --> 00:51:37,088
So... When was the last time
you went out with somebody?

840
00:51:38,289 --> 00:51:39,689
I don't know.

841
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:42,093
I guess you got
all kinds of stuff

842
00:51:42,226 --> 00:51:44,161
just stirring up inside you.

843
00:51:47,265 --> 00:51:48,531
(forcefully exhales)

844
00:51:48,698 --> 00:51:50,400
Yeah, well,
you just think about it.

845
00:51:50,533 --> 00:51:52,136
You know where to find me.

846
00:51:54,105 --> 00:51:56,673
Hey, enjoy your day off.

847
00:51:57,041 --> 00:51:58,109
Thank you.

848
00:52:01,178 --> 00:52:02,280
(door closes)

849
00:52:02,512 --> 00:52:04,447
(ominous music playing)

850
00:52:20,965 --> 00:52:22,099
Later, girl.

851
00:52:25,735 --> 00:52:28,105
(teller muttering)

852
00:52:28,406 --> 00:52:30,308
Now, take care.
Thank you so much.

853
00:52:30,808 --> 00:52:32,475
Hi, how can I help you?

854
00:52:32,609 --> 00:52:33,978
I just need to cash this check.

855
00:52:34,111 --> 00:52:36,646
Teller: Sure. You have
a checking account with us?

856
00:52:37,114 --> 00:52:38,316
I don't. Do I need one?

857
00:52:38,448 --> 00:52:40,550
Yes. In order to cash
your check, you do. Yeah.

858
00:52:40,684 --> 00:52:41,953
Mary: Okay.
Does it cost anything?

859
00:52:42,086 --> 00:52:45,089
It's $25,
but we have great benefits.

860
00:52:46,723 --> 00:52:48,993
- Twenty-five?
- Cashier: Twenty-five, yes.

861
00:52:54,597 --> 00:52:56,100
You have a good day.

862
00:52:59,904 --> 00:53:02,273
Woman: (On TV) <i>It seems
I remember doing this before,</i>

863
00:53:02,739 --> 00:53:04,942
<i>only then
I didn't have so far to fall.</i>

864
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:08,913
(dramatic music plays on TV)

865
00:53:09,847 --> 00:53:11,614
Woman: (on TV)
<i>Where are you now, Martin?</i>

866
00:53:15,152 --> 00:53:19,090
(gentle orchestral
music playing)

867
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:21,092
(sobs)

868
00:53:35,239 --> 00:53:38,042
(child giggling)

869
00:53:59,897 --> 00:54:02,532
He brought by his dog
thinking I would babysit.

870
00:54:02,766 --> 00:54:05,503
I mean,
now what kind of lazy SOB

871
00:54:05,702 --> 00:54:08,005
would think that I would
take care of his dog?

872
00:54:08,272 --> 00:54:10,174
Just crazy son of a...

873
00:54:10,707 --> 00:54:12,810
There you go.
You have a good day.

874
00:54:13,477 --> 00:54:17,547
I sure like that tie and
that pink shirt. Looks good.

875
00:54:18,516 --> 00:54:20,084
Oh. Hey, Mary,

876
00:54:20,284 --> 00:54:22,552
- could you do me a favor?
- What?

877
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:26,556
Curly's yapping about
some spill on aisle four.

878
00:54:27,158 --> 00:54:28,526
Would you clean it up for me?

879
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:32,196
Please? I mean,
my back is just killing me.

880
00:54:32,729 --> 00:54:34,098
I've been standing here

881
00:54:34,265 --> 00:54:38,069
- for four hours.
- Okay, fine. Fine.

882
00:54:38,601 --> 00:54:40,570
I'll watch your register.

883
00:54:43,441 --> 00:54:45,742
Curly: What the fuck
are you talking about?

884
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:47,610
This is not the plan, all right?

885
00:54:47,744 --> 00:54:49,413
He was drunk
off the booze you made.

886
00:54:49,547 --> 00:54:50,780
- Okay?
- Oh, so it's my fault?

887
00:54:50,915 --> 00:54:52,183
- Woman: Yes.
- Curly: Listen,

888
00:54:52,316 --> 00:54:53,517
I have bills to pay.

889
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:55,119
You have a bill to pay.

890
00:54:55,252 --> 00:54:58,222
(muttering)

891
00:54:58,389 --> 00:55:00,858
He fucking gets drunk and
takes advantage of you?

892
00:55:00,991 --> 00:55:02,159
Woman: Go to hell, Curly.

893
00:55:02,293 --> 00:55:04,761
(muttering)

894
00:55:11,035 --> 00:55:12,403
<i>How are you doing today,</i>

895
00:55:12,536 --> 00:55:14,171
- Sister Mary?
- I'm good.

896
00:55:14,671 --> 00:55:17,308
I just got off work and I'm
gonna go meet some friends.

897
00:55:17,908 --> 00:55:20,177
Please, if you want anything,
just help yourself.

898
00:55:20,311 --> 00:55:22,813
Well, I ain't gonna trouble
you none. I just...

899
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,482
I just need a moment
of your time,

900
00:55:24,614 --> 00:55:28,018
if that's okay with you.
You got a little bit of time?

901
00:55:28,419 --> 00:55:30,154
Yeah. Is everything okay?

902
00:55:30,321 --> 00:55:32,289
Nah, nothing like that.

903
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:37,660
You being a nun and all, when
you came looking for a place,

904
00:55:37,794 --> 00:55:41,031
well, you know,
I gave you a special deal.

905
00:55:41,165 --> 00:55:43,400
And I appreciate it a lot.
I really do.

906
00:55:43,534 --> 00:55:44,902
Ah, it was nothing.

907
00:55:45,503 --> 00:55:47,238
It feels good to help, it does.

908
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:50,908
But well, my wife, Ona,

909
00:55:51,876 --> 00:55:53,676
she gets bent
out of shape a lot.

910
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,813
But you gotta understand,
she's a juice head.

911
00:55:55,946 --> 00:55:58,349
Been that was for as
long as I can remember.

912
00:55:58,983 --> 00:56:01,118
And when she caught wind
of me helping out

913
00:56:01,252 --> 00:56:04,321
another young woman and...
Well, she got ideas.

914
00:56:05,022 --> 00:56:07,124
- Is there something that...
- Earl: Hold on now.

915
00:56:07,258 --> 00:56:09,326
I done told her wasn't
nothing going on between us,

916
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:11,362
but that don't mean
she listened.

917
00:56:12,096 --> 00:56:14,797
See, we have a history
that stretches far and wide

918
00:56:14,932 --> 00:56:16,000
across this city.

919
00:56:16,467 --> 00:56:18,536
And I done quit drinking,
understand,

920
00:56:18,668 --> 00:56:20,037
I don't touch this stuff.

921
00:56:20,905 --> 00:56:24,175
This ain't my doing, but anyhow,

922
00:56:24,341 --> 00:56:27,278
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to break our promise.

923
00:56:27,511 --> 00:56:30,814
I know I told you
I needed 450 for this place.

924
00:56:31,248 --> 00:56:33,551
But in order to be fair
to the other tenants,

925
00:56:33,683 --> 00:56:37,087
be fair to Ona, I'm going
to have to ask for 600.

926
00:56:37,488 --> 00:56:38,889
Six hundred dollars?

927
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:40,891
Earl: I'm real sorry.

928
00:56:41,425 --> 00:56:45,129
It ain't like me to promise one
thing and then take it back.

929
00:56:45,362 --> 00:56:49,099
Right. It's just $600
is a lot of money.

930
00:56:49,233 --> 00:56:50,800
My job doesn't pay very much.

931
00:56:51,302 --> 00:56:53,837
Earl: It's tough all over,
Sister Mary.

933

00:56:57,541 --> 00:57:00,110
of another young woman
named Evonne.

935
00:57:00,244 --> 00:57:03,881
She works up at the laundromat.
She's always looking for help.

936
00:57:04,781 --> 00:57:06,584
It ain't much,
but maybe it'll help you

won't put you out much.

- Hello, sisters.
- Sister Mary. Aww!

947
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:03,240
Sister Ruth: You look wonderful.

948
00:58:03,374 --> 00:58:05,542
Sister Honey: We just wanted
to see how you were doing.

949
00:58:05,843 --> 00:58:07,311
Mary: I'm fine.

950
00:58:08,312 --> 00:58:09,446
But how are you?

951
00:58:11,315 --> 00:58:12,383
Mary: Good.

952
00:58:15,085 --> 00:58:17,655
So, you are living in this town?

953
00:58:18,589 --> 00:58:21,791
Yeah, I got an apartment
near here not long ago.

954
00:58:22,226 --> 00:58:23,627
What a coincidence.

955
00:58:23,861 --> 00:58:26,697
We're only a few stops up
the bus line at Villa Lucia.

956
00:58:26,897 --> 00:58:28,899
It must be part of God's plan.

957
00:58:29,266 --> 00:58:31,035
- Do you like it?
- Sister Ruth: Oh, yes.

958
00:58:31,669 --> 00:58:35,139
But it's very different
than Santa Teresa.

959
00:58:35,706 --> 00:58:38,275
- It's a convent in the city.
- Can you imagine?

960
00:58:39,009 --> 00:58:41,111
After Sister Agnes was put away

961
00:58:41,245 --> 00:58:43,747
and Mother Superior
laid to rest...

962
00:58:43,914 --> 00:58:45,282
(murmuring prayer)

963
00:58:45,549 --> 00:58:48,218
...the diocese thought it
best to relocate all of us.

964
00:58:48,352 --> 00:58:52,122
And the new order
is very different.

965
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:55,225
So, what have you been up to?

966
00:58:56,026 --> 00:58:57,428
Well, I got a job.

967
00:58:57,628 --> 00:58:58,996
You're so brave.

968
00:58:59,263 --> 00:59:01,231
I always said that
you were the brave one.

969
00:59:01,365 --> 00:59:04,268
Didn't I always say that about
Sister Mary, Sister Ruth?

970
00:59:04,401 --> 00:59:07,538
Yes, she always
did say that about you.

971
00:59:08,038 --> 00:59:11,008
And also that
you were pure of heart.

972
00:59:11,141 --> 00:59:13,911
I did. I did. (chuckles) I did.

973
00:59:14,411 --> 00:59:16,447
We understand better than anyone

974
00:59:16,647 --> 00:59:19,750
how difficult it must've been
for you to leave the convent

975
00:59:19,883 --> 00:59:21,118
the way that you did.

976
00:59:21,385 --> 00:59:23,153
And we want you to know
we have your best interest

977
00:59:23,287 --> 00:59:25,889
at heart, but we feel that...

978
00:59:26,023 --> 00:59:29,693
Listen, we understand,
we really do.

979
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:34,131
What happened was
traumatizing, to say the least.

980
00:59:34,765 --> 00:59:37,067
Sister Ruth: We want you to know
we have your best interest

981
00:59:37,201 --> 00:59:38,569
- at heart.
- Sister Honey: Traumatizing

982
00:59:38,702 --> 00:59:40,471
for everybody. Traumatizing.

983
00:59:41,605 --> 00:59:44,274
The Church not only
lost Santa Theresa,

984
00:59:44,408 --> 00:59:48,011
I heard it was sold last month,
but Father Donaghue as well.

985
00:59:48,145 --> 00:59:49,613
That brave and gentle man.

986
00:59:49,747 --> 00:59:51,982
- What happened to him?
- Sister Ruth: He disappeared.

987
00:59:52,316 --> 00:59:54,385
No one has seen him since.

988
00:59:55,085 --> 00:59:57,087
We know that
it's been a lot to deal with,

989
00:59:57,221 --> 00:59:58,922
and we respect your choice.

990
00:59:59,323 --> 01:00:02,192
But we would also like
to extend our welcome

991
01:00:02,326 --> 01:00:04,995
if you wanted to join us
at Villa Lucia.

992
01:00:06,497 --> 01:00:11,201
Sister Honey, Sister Ruth,
I appreciate you reaching out,

993
01:00:11,335 --> 01:00:14,705
but after all
we've been through,

994
01:00:14,839 --> 01:00:18,709
it just felt right
to put everything behind me.

995
01:00:19,109 --> 01:00:20,377
We understand that.

996
01:00:20,644 --> 01:00:24,982
But may I ask you
a question, Mary?

997
01:00:25,682 --> 01:00:28,185
- Is it about Agnes?
- Sister Ruth: No.

998
01:00:30,087 --> 01:00:32,189
Do you still carry the faith?

999
01:00:37,027 --> 01:00:38,429
I don't know.

1000
01:00:40,531 --> 01:00:42,800
I keep a crucifix
on the wall in my apartment

1001
01:00:42,933 --> 01:00:44,435
and I pray sometimes,

1002
01:00:44,568 --> 01:00:47,504
but I don't know what
it all means anymore.

1003
01:00:48,439 --> 01:00:50,674
I mean, now that I'm
back in the real world,

1004
01:00:50,809 --> 01:00:54,311
my time at the convent
feels like a dream.

1005
01:00:56,747 --> 01:00:58,682
I keep asking for God
to guide me and...

1006
01:01:01,018 --> 01:01:02,453
I hear nothing back.

1007
01:01:09,126 --> 01:01:10,594
Did you know
among our other duties

1008
01:01:10,727 --> 01:01:13,764
in the new order,
we service the poor.

1009
01:01:14,498 --> 01:01:16,967
Yes, our soup lines
are very popular. (chuckles)

1010
01:01:23,574 --> 01:01:25,742
Hey, I got this.

1011
01:01:28,111 --> 01:01:30,614
Thanks. I'm gonna go clock out.

1012
01:01:31,215 --> 01:01:34,184
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1013
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:44,628
Curly: Hey, whoa.

1014
01:01:45,996 --> 01:01:47,297
Who's taking over your shift?

1015
01:01:47,531 --> 01:01:49,399
It's Wanda. She's out there now.

1016
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,135
Can't be Wanda.
I done fired Wanda.

1017
01:01:53,103 --> 01:01:54,338
- No, I didn't know.
- Yeah, well,

1018
01:01:54,471 --> 01:01:56,106
there's a lot
you don't know about.

1019
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:59,543
Especially what
goes on back here.

1020
01:01:59,811 --> 01:02:01,078
I don't know.

1021
01:02:01,345 --> 01:02:03,413
I noticed you've been picking up
a lot of double shifts.

1022
01:02:04,481 --> 01:02:07,518
You're a worker.
Not like these other girls that,

1023
01:02:08,385 --> 01:02:10,754
they don't care
about getting ahead.

1024
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:13,757
- My rent just went up.
- Yeah, I know

1025
01:02:13,892 --> 01:02:15,058
your rent just went up.

1026
01:02:15,192 --> 01:02:16,693
And I get it. I get it.

1027
01:02:17,394 --> 01:02:19,663
We all got stuff like that
in our lives.

1028
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:22,032
Let me ask you something.
This job,

1029
01:02:22,466 --> 01:02:25,569
all the double shifts,
the back-to-backs,

1030
01:02:27,237 --> 01:02:28,739
is it gonna be enough?

1031
01:02:30,607 --> 01:02:31,675
We'll see.

1032
01:02:32,142 --> 01:02:33,577
Yeah, we'll see.

1033
01:02:34,611 --> 01:02:35,712
How about this?

1034
01:02:36,647 --> 01:02:40,651
How about I give you
a little extra cash.

1035
01:02:42,386 --> 01:02:44,154
Then when I need a favor,

1036
01:02:44,989 --> 01:02:47,691
- I can call on you.
- Mary: No, thank you.

1037
01:02:49,726 --> 01:02:50,929
"No, thank you"?

1038
01:02:51,094 --> 01:02:53,330
I appreciate it.
But I can't take that.

1039
01:02:54,498 --> 01:02:56,466
My money's not good
enough for you?

1040
01:02:57,067 --> 01:02:59,136
I'd just like to make it
my own way.

1041
01:03:00,203 --> 01:03:01,371
(clears throat)

1042
01:03:03,841 --> 01:03:05,309
Yeah, I can respect that.

1043
01:03:08,178 --> 01:03:09,847
I'm going to get you
one of these days.

1044
01:03:12,149 --> 01:03:13,650
I better go back up front.

1045
01:03:13,952 --> 01:03:15,319
Curly: Yeah, go on.

1046
01:03:28,498 --> 01:03:30,367
Evonne:
So, you're Earl's friend?

1047
01:03:30,902 --> 01:03:32,135
Yeah.

1048
01:03:33,136 --> 01:03:34,371
I'm his tenant.

1049
01:03:34,839 --> 01:03:36,206
Mm-hmm.

1050
01:03:37,207 --> 01:03:38,442
He's really nice.

1051
01:03:39,309 --> 01:03:40,777
Evonne: Oh, I'll bet he is.

1052
01:03:42,479 --> 01:03:45,883
(light acoustic music playing)

1053
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:05,535
Host: <i>Lady, if you don't know
the difference between</i>

1054
01:04:05,669 --> 01:04:08,106
<i>a meatball and a matzo ball,
I cannot help you.</i>

1055
01:04:08,238 --> 01:04:09,573
(audience laughs)

1056
01:04:09,706 --> 01:04:11,675
Anyway, please give it
up for my good friend,

1057
01:04:11,809 --> 01:04:14,311
the great Paul Satchimo,
ladies and gentlemen.

1058
01:04:14,444 --> 01:04:16,480
- Paul Satchimo.
- (audience applaud)

1059
01:04:18,715 --> 01:04:20,784
Hey, everybody.

1060
01:04:21,019 --> 01:04:22,386
You know what I've noticed?

1061
01:04:23,353 --> 01:04:25,857
Not everybody's trying.
You ever notice that?

1062
01:04:26,423 --> 01:04:29,861
Okay, I saw a guy
on the sidewalk yesterday,

1063
01:04:29,994 --> 01:04:32,162
he was pushing a shopping cart
full of newspapers,

1064
01:04:32,562 --> 01:04:34,098
wearing pink stretch pants.

1065
01:04:34,398 --> 01:04:36,968
- He was trying.
- (laughter)

1066
01:04:37,167 --> 01:04:38,936
He went to the bank
to get a loan.

1067
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:41,672
They weren't trying at all.

1068
01:04:42,606 --> 01:04:45,342
I went to this bar back here
to cash in my two drink limit,

1069
01:04:45,475 --> 01:04:47,644
and, man.. (scoffs)
...they weren't trying either.

1070
01:04:47,812 --> 01:04:52,416
So, now here I am,
up here trying, dead sober.

1071
01:04:52,582 --> 01:04:55,019
- (laughter)
- Okay. Check this out.

1072
01:04:55,153 --> 01:04:58,156
Some people are trying,
some people aren't trying.

1073
01:04:58,622 --> 01:05:00,424
Some people
aren't even trying to try.

1074
01:05:00,557 --> 01:05:04,294
But some people
are trying to not try.

1075
01:05:05,429 --> 01:05:11,368
And some people are trying
to try not trying.

1076
01:05:13,071 --> 01:05:15,106
Hey, if I thought that
could work, I might try it.

1077
01:05:15,238 --> 01:05:16,673
(laughter)

1078
01:05:18,408 --> 01:05:21,278
Anyway, what do you
guys want to talk about?

1079
01:05:22,013 --> 01:05:23,246
Money?

1080
01:05:24,882 --> 01:05:25,850
Jobs?

1081
01:05:27,284 --> 01:05:30,420
I had a regular type
job once, I did.

1082
01:05:32,389 --> 01:05:34,092
I was a cold caller

1083
01:05:34,926 --> 01:05:38,295
selling restaurant quality
meats at wholesale prices.

1084
01:05:38,462 --> 01:05:40,098
I was not very good at it.

1085
01:05:40,263 --> 01:05:41,498
(laughter)

1086
01:05:42,365 --> 01:05:43,667
One night...

1087
01:05:44,301 --> 01:05:46,470
Yes, one night...

1088
01:05:48,973 --> 01:05:50,007
victory.

1089
01:05:51,742 --> 01:05:54,644
I sold 25 pounds
of New York strips

1090
01:05:54,812 --> 01:05:57,849
all across the greater
metropolitan area.

1091
01:05:59,117 --> 01:06:01,018
My name topped the sales board.

1092
01:06:01,485 --> 01:06:05,123
I rose from my cubicle
like a champion

1093
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:10,727
as my colleagues watched
with... with, um...

1094
01:06:11,428 --> 01:06:12,796
with envy,

1095
01:06:13,497 --> 01:06:14,765
and disdain
because they knew...

1096
01:06:14,899 --> 01:06:16,500
- (laughter)
- ...that I had been chosen

1097
01:06:16,666 --> 01:06:19,336
by the team leader, Mark,

1098
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:23,273
to enter the inner sanctum,

1099
01:06:23,573 --> 01:06:25,275
the deep freeze,

1100
01:06:26,376 --> 01:06:29,412
the deep freeze
which held a cornucopia

1101
01:06:30,948 --> 01:06:32,716
of frozen meat products.

1102
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:34,852
And as I stood there,

1103
01:06:36,286 --> 01:06:37,521
gazing into the...

1104
01:06:38,522 --> 01:06:40,757
the glistening vista
of frozen meats,

1105
01:06:40,892 --> 01:06:45,963
Mark said to me and I quote,
"Pick anything you want."

1106
01:06:50,902 --> 01:06:52,402
Anyway, that's it.
That's the story.

1107
01:06:52,536 --> 01:06:54,906
It's not really a joke, I guess.

1108
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:59,877
It's really more
just a 38-year-old man

1109
01:07:00,011 --> 01:07:03,147
sitting alone in his apartment,
eating three pounds of sausage.

1110
01:07:03,513 --> 01:07:05,082
(audience burst into laughter)

1111
01:07:07,651 --> 01:07:10,087
You know what, that sausage
didn't make me happy.

1112
01:07:10,221 --> 01:07:14,125
Things, things do not
make people happy.

1113
01:07:14,959 --> 01:07:17,727
Do you know what does make
people happy? Do you know?

1114
01:07:19,096 --> 01:07:20,430
Connection.

1115
01:07:21,631 --> 01:07:26,770
Us, connecting in this room,
right now.

1116
01:07:26,904 --> 01:07:28,873
- Forget about the sausage.
- (laughter)

1117
01:07:29,006 --> 01:07:30,774
It's an electricity.
Do you feel it?

1118
01:07:30,908 --> 01:07:32,576
- Right now, it's happening.
- Father Donaghue: <i>It's us.</i>

1119
01:07:32,742 --> 01:07:34,377
<i>We're communicating
with one another.</i>

1120
01:07:34,511 --> 01:07:36,147
<i>That's where real happiness
comes from. I don't know.</i>

1121
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,748
<i>Anyway, what else you
guys want to talk about?</i>

1122
01:07:40,584 --> 01:07:43,653
(pulsating music playing)

1123
01:07:50,127 --> 01:07:52,529
(laughs)

1124
01:08:03,207 --> 01:08:05,109
Frozen meats.

1125
01:08:10,915 --> 01:08:12,116
(laughs)

1126
01:08:14,051 --> 01:08:15,052
Hey, hey, hey.

1127
01:08:15,253 --> 01:08:17,687
What is so funny?
People are complaining.

1128
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:20,590
(giggles)

1129
01:08:22,059 --> 01:08:24,228
- That's what I thought.
- (laughs)

1130
01:08:24,427 --> 01:08:26,529
Would you calm the fuck down?

1131
01:08:28,065 --> 01:08:29,499
Mary: I'm sorry.

1132
01:08:31,135 --> 01:08:32,402
Jesus Christ.

1133
01:08:38,541 --> 01:08:41,411
(lively music playing)

1134
01:08:45,283 --> 01:08:47,818
Evonne: <i>It can't compare
to the nonsense,</i>

1135
01:08:47,952 --> 01:08:49,452
<i>She started saying things.</i>

1136
01:08:49,586 --> 01:08:53,925
(music drowns out
Evonne's words)

1137
01:08:59,196 --> 01:09:01,531
And concentrate
on the things you can handle.

1138
01:09:02,233 --> 01:09:04,734
Sometimes,
I gotta pray for strength.

1139
01:09:05,403 --> 01:09:06,603
Like the good book says,

1140
01:09:06,736 --> 01:09:08,940
"Like a dog
returneth to its vomit,

1141
01:09:09,073 --> 01:09:11,309
so a fool repeats
his foolishness."

1142
01:09:11,876 --> 01:09:14,211
Mary, are you even
listening to me?

1143
01:09:20,351 --> 01:09:22,652
Hi. Do you need any help?

1144
01:09:23,287 --> 01:09:26,556
Um, no, I don't think so.
I just came in here to...

1145
01:09:27,624 --> 01:09:29,193
Wait, what do people
come in here to do?

1146
01:09:29,393 --> 01:09:32,430
(laughs) Um, I can show
you how the machines work.

1147
01:09:32,562 --> 01:09:33,998
(washing machines rattling)

1148
01:09:34,432 --> 01:09:36,834
I think I got it, but thank you.

1149
01:09:37,435 --> 01:09:38,635
No problem.

1150
01:09:43,573 --> 01:09:44,909
Okay, well.

1151
01:09:45,042 --> 01:09:47,078
Yeah, just let me know
if you need anything.

1152
01:09:47,211 --> 01:09:48,179
Paul: Sure.

1153
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:58,755
- Who's that?
- He's a comedian.

1154
01:09:58,956 --> 01:10:01,959
He don't look funny.
Is he funny?

1155
01:10:02,625 --> 01:10:04,494
Yes. He's a comedian.

1156
01:10:16,606 --> 01:10:18,009
(door creaking)

1157
01:10:23,314 --> 01:10:25,216
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

1158
01:10:27,517 --> 01:10:29,519
Am I not allowed
to smoke out here?

1159
01:10:29,753 --> 01:10:30,988
It's fine.

1160
01:10:31,588 --> 01:10:33,656
Cool. You never know these days.

1161
01:10:35,826 --> 01:10:37,094
I saw your show.

1162
01:10:38,561 --> 01:10:41,765
Oh, okay. Well, no wonder.

1163
01:10:42,732 --> 01:10:44,268
Well, thanks for coming.

1164
01:10:51,842 --> 01:10:53,210
So, what did you think?

1165
01:10:53,743 --> 01:10:55,112
Of the show?

1166
01:10:55,246 --> 01:10:56,914
Yeah. Did you laugh?

1167
01:10:57,580 --> 01:10:58,748
- No.
- Huh!

1168
01:11:00,784 --> 01:11:02,319
Everyone's a critic.

1169
01:11:03,487 --> 01:11:05,089
It wasn't my best night.

1170
01:11:07,425 --> 01:11:08,893
But I laughed later.

1171
01:11:10,361 --> 01:11:12,063
Well, I guess that's something,

1172
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:14,697
the slow burn kind of a thing.

1173
01:11:17,234 --> 01:11:21,038
Of course, the point is
to laugh during the show.

1174
01:11:21,172 --> 01:11:24,241
That's kind of the idea,
I guess.

1175
01:11:25,742 --> 01:11:27,278
Hell, I dunno.
You know what?

1176
01:11:27,978 --> 01:11:30,247
Laugh when you wanna laugh.
It's a free country.

1177
01:11:32,782 --> 01:11:34,151
I knew Agnes.

1178
01:11:36,821 --> 01:11:38,222
Excuse me?

1179
01:11:38,956 --> 01:11:42,026
I was in the convent
with Agnes before she left.

1180
01:11:44,295 --> 01:11:45,329
Oh.

1181
01:11:46,596 --> 01:11:47,932
Wow.

1182
01:11:48,866 --> 01:11:50,167
She was in love with you.

1183
01:11:51,836 --> 01:11:55,172
(gentle guitar music playing)

1184
01:11:59,709 --> 01:12:02,980
(pulsating roaring)

1185
01:12:14,892 --> 01:12:16,360
You look nice.

1186
01:12:21,798 --> 01:12:25,269
Paul: I have to say I haven't
even heard her name in...

1187
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:27,938
I don't know, it's been awhile.

1188
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:30,207
You must've known her
pretty well.

1189
01:12:31,475 --> 01:12:32,775
Mary: We had talks.

1190
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:35,778
Not a lot, but the ones we had
were important.

1191
01:12:36,679 --> 01:12:38,115
She was incredible.

1192
01:12:39,016 --> 01:12:40,683
And do you know
where she is now?

1193
01:12:40,818 --> 01:12:43,320
You mentioned
she left the convent.

1194
01:12:44,822 --> 01:12:47,224
She's in a different place now.

1195
01:12:47,992 --> 01:12:49,426
What do you mean?

1196
01:12:50,793 --> 01:12:52,296
I don't want to talk about it.

1197
01:12:53,631 --> 01:12:54,965
I understand.

1198
01:12:56,367 --> 01:12:59,069
I always wondered about her,
to be honest.

1199
01:13:00,171 --> 01:13:03,773
The minute that things
got hard between us

1200
01:13:04,141 --> 01:13:06,277
was the minute she gave up.
And I never bought into any

1201
01:13:06,410 --> 01:13:08,212
of her religious horseshit,
by the way.

1202
01:13:08,512 --> 01:13:11,282
I'm sorry if I offend, but I...

1203
01:13:11,849 --> 01:13:15,853
I couldn't understand why she
went to such great lengths

1204
01:13:15,986 --> 01:13:18,455
for her salvation.

1205
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:20,925
Anyway, we were young.

1206
01:13:21,691 --> 01:13:25,462
I... I didn't usually make
a habit of dating my students,

1207
01:13:25,596 --> 01:13:29,066
but I, you know, in that case
I made an exception.

1208
01:13:30,834 --> 01:13:32,870
How long have you
been a funny man?

1209
01:13:34,737 --> 01:13:36,941
A what? (laughs)

1210
01:13:38,609 --> 01:13:41,445
I guess, I don't know,
I've always been funny.

1211
01:13:41,845 --> 01:13:45,015
I, uh, I was funny
when I was a kid,

1212
01:13:45,349 --> 01:13:48,852
started putting an act
together when I was like 19,

1213
01:13:48,986 --> 01:13:52,856
and I should probably be
farther along in my career

1214
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:54,757
than I am, but...

1215
01:13:55,059 --> 01:13:58,829
But you're comfortable?
You like who you are?

1216
01:13:59,697 --> 01:14:00,931
Yeah, I think so.

1217
01:14:01,332 --> 01:14:04,068
I... I make just
the right amount of money

1218
01:14:04,201 --> 01:14:09,273
and I... I'm happy
living life the way that I do.

1219
01:14:09,406 --> 01:14:10,574
I don't,

1220
01:14:11,609 --> 01:14:15,312
I don't need fame or fortune.
I do what I love.

1221
01:14:16,413 --> 01:14:18,482
How about you?
What's your story?

1222
01:14:19,650 --> 01:14:21,385
Why did you leave the convent?

1223
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:24,555
That was Agnes, really.

1224
01:14:25,389 --> 01:14:27,691
She convinced me there
was maybe more to life

1225
01:14:27,825 --> 01:14:28,993
outside the Church.

1226
01:14:30,995 --> 01:14:32,396
So, what do you think?

1227
01:14:33,497 --> 01:14:36,267
I don't think either of us
ever belonged there.

1228
01:14:39,069 --> 01:14:40,671
Is there anything
you're passionate about?

1229
01:14:41,005 --> 01:14:42,439
Anything at all?

1230
01:14:44,774 --> 01:14:46,076
I don't know.

1231
01:14:46,443 --> 01:14:50,014
The only thing I ever worked
hard for was becoming a sister.

1232
01:14:52,283 --> 01:14:55,853
Well, geez, Mary, that's about
the saddest thing I ever heard.

1233
01:14:58,222 --> 01:15:00,190
Can I ask you
a personal question?

1234
01:15:01,392 --> 01:15:03,961
Have you ever felt love
outside of God?

1235
01:15:07,264 --> 01:15:10,567
(gentle piano music playing)

1236
01:15:11,669 --> 01:15:15,205
Pedro: Hey, Paul, don't mind us.
We just been here a few hours.

1237
01:15:15,539 --> 01:15:17,174
Are you gonna introduce
us to your friend?

1238
01:15:17,308 --> 01:15:21,378
Oh, sorry. Peter, Evelyn, Pedro.
This is Mary.

1239
01:15:21,512 --> 01:15:23,047
Evelyn: Nice to meet you.
He's the best.

1240
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:24,515
I always say he's the best.

1241
01:15:24,648 --> 01:15:27,318
(gentle music playing)

1242
01:15:39,697 --> 01:15:43,067
Anyway, here we are.

1243
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:50,274
You can feel free
to make yourself at home.

1244
01:15:54,378 --> 01:15:56,980
I don't know, have a seat
or whatever you do.

1245
01:15:57,816 --> 01:16:00,017
I'll be right back.

1246
01:16:07,826 --> 01:16:09,293
I like your place.

1247
01:16:09,626 --> 01:16:11,128
Paul: Thank you.

1248
01:16:17,701 --> 01:16:19,470
You were the funniest man?

1249
01:16:20,003 --> 01:16:22,773
- Like in the world?
- Paul: What's that?

1250
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:26,977
Oh, that? Yeah.
That was many years ago.

1251
01:16:28,011 --> 01:16:29,646
Who's the funniest man now?

1252
01:16:32,049 --> 01:16:33,450
Um...

1253
01:16:34,718 --> 01:16:36,086
I actually don't know.

1254
01:16:37,888 --> 01:16:39,156
Do you like music?

1255
01:16:39,757 --> 01:16:40,991
I used to.

1256
01:16:42,326 --> 01:16:43,427
Okay.

1257
01:16:46,797 --> 01:16:49,333
You read a lot. Books.

1258
01:16:49,533 --> 01:16:53,270
Oh, yeah. Well, as I said,
I used to teach.

1259
01:16:54,004 --> 01:16:55,606
There was a time...

1260
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,843
I can't say that I really
have the focus to just...

1261
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:03,447
to just sit and read a book.
I haven't for a while.

1262
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:05,282
I don't know
what happened there.

1263
01:17:06,717 --> 01:17:07,985
What do you do now?

1264
01:17:08,285 --> 01:17:10,954
You mean to take
the place of reading?

1265
01:17:11,922 --> 01:17:13,323
Um...

1266
01:17:14,024 --> 01:17:17,194
I don't know. I guess I drink.

1267
01:17:23,667 --> 01:17:26,537
I have to say, I don't know why
I'm being so honest with you.

1268
01:17:26,871 --> 01:17:29,440
I know that we just met,
and I...

1269
01:17:31,108 --> 01:17:33,076
I don't know.
Well, you're not...

1270
01:17:34,378 --> 01:17:38,015
you're not the usual sort
of woman that I associate with.

1271
01:17:44,588 --> 01:17:46,590
You asked me a question
in the bar

1272
01:17:46,858 --> 01:17:48,492
before your friends came.

1273
01:17:49,426 --> 01:17:50,594
Yeah.

1274
01:17:50,761 --> 01:17:53,130
I asked you if you'd ever
been in love before.

1275
01:17:57,134 --> 01:17:58,569
The answer is yes.

1276
01:18:03,474 --> 01:18:07,311
When I was really young,
I got pregnant.

1277
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:12,516
Back then, I was
a different kind of person.

1278
01:18:13,517 --> 01:18:16,787
I don't even
remember the conception

1279
01:18:16,987 --> 01:18:19,590
or who the guy was.

1280
01:18:22,559 --> 01:18:25,128
Anyway, I decided
to keep the baby.

1281
01:18:28,098 --> 01:18:29,366
And it was like...

1282
01:18:31,468 --> 01:18:34,505
a whole new window
opened up on my life.

1283
01:18:37,508 --> 01:18:42,179
I loved my son
with everything I had.

1284
01:18:44,348 --> 01:18:47,518
I loved the way he laughed.

1285
01:18:47,784 --> 01:18:50,354
I loved to hear him cry
when I left the room.

1286
01:18:50,487 --> 01:18:55,292
I loved the color of his cheeks
and his stupid little teeth.

1287
01:18:58,930 --> 01:19:00,264
I was even...

1288
01:19:02,032 --> 01:19:03,600
starting to love God.

1289
01:19:04,801 --> 01:19:08,472
(melancholy music playing)

1290
01:19:18,248 --> 01:19:21,251
<i>Then, one day,
God took my son away</i>

1291
01:19:21,385 --> 01:19:22,854
<i>and left me with nothing.</i>

1292
01:19:23,353 --> 01:19:26,123
<i>I prayed.
I begged God to tell me why.</i>

1293
01:19:26,423 --> 01:19:29,593
- <i>And he said...</i>
- Paul: <i>What'd he say?</i>

1294
01:19:32,629 --> 01:19:34,097
He said nothing.

1295
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:43,041
I don't know what lives there
in that nothingness now.

1296
01:19:43,173 --> 01:19:44,408
But he just...

1297
01:19:47,812 --> 01:19:49,146
he put a spell on me.

1298
01:20:02,225 --> 01:20:05,162
(ominous music playing)

1299
01:20:21,545 --> 01:20:24,214
(indistinct hollering)

1300
01:20:27,217 --> 01:20:28,752
(indistinct yelling continues)

1301
01:20:32,289 --> 01:20:34,124
- (yelling stops)
- (moans)

1302
01:20:39,329 --> 01:20:41,765
(Paul groans)

1303
01:20:43,901 --> 01:20:45,802
- (Mary laughs)
- What is the matter with you?

1304
01:20:46,037 --> 01:20:48,505
(laughs)
Oh, I'm sorry.

1305
01:20:49,272 --> 01:20:52,043
- (laughs)
- Stop fucking laughing, then.

1306
01:20:52,376 --> 01:20:53,744
I'm sorry.
No, I'm really sorry.

1307
01:20:53,878 --> 01:20:56,047
- Why did you do that?
- I'm really sorry.

1308
01:20:56,179 --> 01:20:58,215
(demonic laughs)

1309
01:20:58,348 --> 01:21:00,517
My face!
I have a show tomorrow night!

1310
01:21:00,651 --> 01:21:02,786
- Are you sick or something?
- Mary: No, please. No.

1311
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:05,023
Paul: Just... just leave, okay?
Come on. Just...

1312
01:21:05,522 --> 01:21:07,391
(ominous music playing)

1313
01:21:07,892 --> 01:21:10,661
- (Mary panting)
- (Paul groaning)

1314
01:21:18,002 --> 01:21:20,071
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.</i>

1315
01:21:20,237 --> 01:21:21,505
Blessed art thou amongst women

1316
01:21:21,638 --> 01:21:23,007
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

1317
01:21:23,141 --> 01:21:24,708
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners

1318
01:21:24,842 --> 01:21:26,610
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

1319
01:21:26,743 --> 01:21:29,080
Dear God, please listen to me,
please listen to me.

1320
01:21:29,312 --> 01:21:32,116
(continues praying silently)

1321
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:37,088
Please, I beg you. I beg you.
I'll do anything you want me to.

1322
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:38,488
Please just talk to me.

1323
01:21:38,622 --> 01:21:42,160
Please just show me,
show me, please.

1324
01:21:42,292 --> 01:21:45,295
(muttering)

1325
01:21:46,998 --> 01:21:48,465
(ticketing gun clicking)

1326
01:21:49,566 --> 01:21:51,702
(clicking echoing)

1327
01:21:52,402 --> 01:21:53,770
(loud rattle)

1328
01:21:54,038 --> 01:21:56,808
(clicking echoing)

1329
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:06,216
(dryer rumbling)

1330
01:22:21,364 --> 01:22:24,434
(bench squeaking)

1331
01:22:39,183 --> 01:22:40,684
Excuse me.

1332
01:22:41,651 --> 01:22:43,320
<i>Yes, I know it's a big diocese,</i>

1333
01:22:43,453 --> 01:22:44,621
but someone in your office

1334
01:22:44,755 --> 01:22:46,157
has to know
who I'm talking about.

1335
01:22:46,389 --> 01:22:48,391
He was around the tragedy
at the Santa Teresa convent.

1336
01:22:48,525 --> 01:22:49,894
I was a sister there.

1337
01:22:50,161 --> 01:22:53,563
(grunts) Okay. Yes. Okay.
I can hold on, but I am at work.

1338
01:22:55,133 --> 01:22:57,835
- What the fuck are you doing?
- It's an emergency.

1339
01:22:59,369 --> 01:23:00,704
Crazy bitch.

1340
01:23:00,838 --> 01:23:02,372
(snarls)

1341
01:23:04,108 --> 01:23:05,877
Hello? Okay, hold on.

1342
01:23:08,545 --> 01:23:10,081
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1343
01:23:10,248 --> 01:23:13,350
You're sure that's
the right number? Thank you.

1344
01:23:14,484 --> 01:23:15,953
Curly: You're fired.

1345
01:23:21,926 --> 01:23:23,360
You're fired!

1346
01:23:25,163 --> 01:23:27,031
<i>You think you
might be possessed?</i>

1347
01:23:28,166 --> 01:23:29,332
That's serious.

1348
01:23:29,566 --> 01:23:32,736
No, not really, I guess.
(sniffs)

1349
01:23:33,436 --> 01:23:34,839
You shouldn't joke about that.

1350
01:23:35,305 --> 01:23:38,075
I think I just remember Agnes.

1351
01:23:39,442 --> 01:23:40,945
Were you two close?

1352
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:46,383
Yes. Yes, we were.

1353
01:23:47,717 --> 01:23:50,720
We had a good conversation
right before she, uh...

1354
01:23:51,588 --> 01:23:54,791
you know. Anyway,
she helped me rethink my life.

1355
01:23:54,992 --> 01:23:58,328
That's great. I never
would've guessed that about her.

1356
01:24:02,365 --> 01:24:03,767
So, how's it going?

1357
01:24:05,303 --> 01:24:06,570
Oh, I don't know.

1358
01:24:07,271 --> 01:24:10,607
I just walked out on my job,
so.... (snickers)

1359
01:24:12,977 --> 01:24:15,279
You know, after what
happened at Santa Teresa,

1360
01:24:15,412 --> 01:24:17,447
the Church would probably
put you up for a few months

1361
01:24:17,581 --> 01:24:18,983
if you can't make rent.

1362
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:22,887
Thanks, but I'll figure it out.
I'll call you again if I can't.

1363
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:24,788
Now, I'm told
your former sisters

1364
01:24:24,922 --> 01:24:27,258
invited you to join them
at Villa Lucia.

1365
01:24:28,025 --> 01:24:29,526
Do you think
the life of a religious

1366
01:24:29,659 --> 01:24:31,128
could appeal to you again?

1367
01:24:33,231 --> 01:24:34,431
I don't think so.

1368
01:24:34,698 --> 01:24:36,167
It's different
than Santa Teresa.

1369
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:38,668
It's less confined.

1370
01:24:40,437 --> 01:24:41,806
But if you no longer
hear the call.

1371
01:24:41,939 --> 01:24:43,241
Maybe not then.

1372
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:44,976
Well, maybe not.

1373
01:24:45,810 --> 01:24:47,044
A wise man once taught me

1374
01:24:47,178 --> 01:24:48,980
it's not something
you should try to fake.

1375
01:24:51,282 --> 01:24:54,584
So, can you think of any other
work you'd be passionate about?

1376
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:57,420
No.

1377
01:24:58,622 --> 01:25:00,892
You, uh...

1378
01:25:02,559 --> 01:25:03,828
Oh, never mind.

1379
01:25:04,594 --> 01:25:05,897
What?

1380
01:25:06,831 --> 01:25:08,598
It can't be that bad.

1381
01:25:11,302 --> 01:25:12,636
I had a son.

1382
01:25:13,371 --> 01:25:14,604
He died.

1383
01:25:15,339 --> 01:25:17,407
Just now, I was thinking how
much I would've liked him

1384
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:19,476
to grow up and be like you.

1385
01:25:20,677 --> 01:25:22,280
And that's way too much.

1386
01:25:22,746 --> 01:25:25,049
- (Mary chuckles)
- No, it's not.

1387
01:25:26,449 --> 01:25:27,885
It's just, um...

1388
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:32,656
my mother died.
I was 11.

1389
01:25:37,361 --> 01:25:38,896
So, that means a lot.

1390
01:25:43,935 --> 01:25:46,037
Can I ask you
a spiritual question?

1391
01:25:46,904 --> 01:25:48,306
Benjamin: Yeah,
of course, it's my job.

1392
01:25:48,438 --> 01:25:50,707
I hope I can answer it.

1393
01:25:51,842 --> 01:25:53,543
How do we know God?

1394
01:25:54,544 --> 01:25:56,013
Well, there's scripture.

1395
01:25:56,147 --> 01:25:58,715
And there's a few thousand
years of church teaching.

1396
01:25:58,849 --> 01:26:00,084
I'm not talking
about any of that.

1397
01:26:00,217 --> 01:26:04,521
I'm talking about contact,
connection.

1398
01:26:04,654 --> 01:26:07,325
How do we know God?
How do you know God?

1399
01:26:07,691 --> 01:26:09,894
- In this world?
- Mary: Yeah.

1400
01:26:14,365 --> 01:26:18,102
Okay. Yeah, I'll try.

1401
01:26:19,803 --> 01:26:23,606
Just remember, I haven't
been a priest very long, so.

1402
01:26:26,143 --> 01:26:27,144
All right.

1403
01:26:27,311 --> 01:26:28,913
Let's take this sandwich.
We're hungry

1404
01:26:29,046 --> 01:26:30,815
and it's all we've got,
but let's look at it.

1405
01:26:31,048 --> 01:26:33,451
First, there's this
terrible crappy bread

1406
01:26:33,583 --> 01:26:36,087
you've got to get through.
And that's most of it, really.

1407
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:37,487
It's so much bread,

1408
01:26:37,721 --> 01:26:40,891
this starchy, substandard
awfulness, this filler.

1409
01:26:41,092 --> 01:26:42,927
Most of this sandwich,
most of this world,

1410
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:44,627
just a bunch of junk
to chew through,

1411
01:26:44,761 --> 01:26:46,130
hoping that it ends soon.

1412
01:26:48,165 --> 01:26:50,633
Then you got
flavorless tomatoes,

1413
01:26:51,634 --> 01:26:53,904
this wilted lettuce.
Cheese looks like death.

1414
01:26:54,171 --> 01:26:56,474
Sauce, if you had a jar of it,
you'd probably die.

1415
01:26:56,673 --> 01:26:59,143
But hidden within all
this sound and fury

1416
01:26:59,910 --> 01:27:01,678
is a thin sliver of meat.
And that's the stuff

1417
01:27:01,846 --> 01:27:03,347
we really came here for. Right?

1418
01:27:03,481 --> 01:27:05,916
You can imagine a better
sandwich, a better world...

1419
01:27:07,351 --> 01:27:08,651
I know I can.

1420
01:27:09,753 --> 01:27:11,188
More fulfilling, with more meat.

1421
01:27:11,422 --> 01:27:13,723
Just like you can imagine
more good people

1422
01:27:13,858 --> 01:27:16,293
when you've met one
really good one, you know?

1423
01:27:17,495 --> 01:27:18,628
Okay.

1424
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:20,563
So for Christians, at least,

1425
01:27:20,697 --> 01:27:23,968
that one really good person
who brings out the best in you,

1426
01:27:24,101 --> 01:27:26,103
makes you want to bring out
the best in other people,

1427
01:27:26,237 --> 01:27:27,138
that's Christ.

1428
01:27:27,972 --> 01:27:31,175
And if you look hard enough,
he's in this world.

1429
01:27:32,843 --> 01:27:34,211
He's the meat in the sandwich,

1430
01:27:34,345 --> 01:27:36,780
this stuff we'd realize
we were really hungry for

1431
01:27:36,914 --> 01:27:39,216
if we knew ourselves
like God knows us.

1432
01:27:41,485 --> 01:27:43,320
Because Christ is God incarnate,

1433
01:27:43,454 --> 01:27:45,722
and carne means meat, flesh.

1434
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:48,459
You know, he comes to us
in a form that we can recognize,

1435
01:27:48,625 --> 01:27:50,861
God in a meat suit like us.

1436
01:27:51,761 --> 01:27:52,997
God <i>con carne.</i>

1437
01:27:53,297 --> 01:27:56,967
But to know him in this world,
to really know him,

1438
01:27:57,101 --> 01:27:59,003
you have to deal
with the whole sandwich.

1439
01:27:59,503 --> 01:28:01,172
And if you chew through it,

1440
01:28:02,173 --> 01:28:04,707
and you keep a pure heart,
you can know God,

1441
01:28:06,143 --> 01:28:07,677
taste God.

1442
01:28:11,449 --> 01:28:12,850
You just ate God.

1443
01:28:14,018 --> 01:28:16,353
Well, he invites us to.
That's the sacrament.

1444
01:28:16,954 --> 01:28:18,956
Take this, my body,
and eat of it.

1445
01:28:20,257 --> 01:28:23,894
He invites us to the feast.
And it's a gift freely given.

1446
01:28:24,095 --> 01:28:26,629
And as long as we're willing
to open our hearts.

1447
01:28:29,333 --> 01:28:31,801
When I open my heart,
it just hurts.

1448
01:28:32,369 --> 01:28:33,736
That's right.

1449
01:28:34,637 --> 01:28:35,973
I think you know.

1450
01:28:38,476 --> 01:28:39,877
Something has to go out of you.

1451
01:28:40,144 --> 01:28:42,847
To make room
for the spirit to come in.

1452
01:28:45,416 --> 01:28:47,151
We get there by loss.

1453
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:51,522
That's what spiritual hunger is.

1454
01:28:52,156 --> 01:28:54,325
And joy can follow, too,
if we let it.

1455
01:28:54,959 --> 01:28:58,129
Like we have to say goodbye
to the people we love,

1456
01:28:59,463 --> 01:29:01,265
the people we care about.

1457
01:29:02,665 --> 01:29:04,902
(gentle piano music playing)

1458
01:29:05,336 --> 01:29:06,669
I'm afraid so.

1459
01:29:07,972 --> 01:29:10,007
Hopefully not too soon.

1460
01:29:13,477 --> 01:29:17,815
But no one can ever
actually say goodbye, right?

1461
01:29:19,216 --> 01:29:22,419
(suspenseful music playing)

1462
01:29:24,388 --> 01:29:25,856
Benjamin: No.

1463
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:40,004
(orchestral music playing)
