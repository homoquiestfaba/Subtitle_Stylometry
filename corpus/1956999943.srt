00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:15,583
[sleigh bells jangling]

2
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,541
[woman] <i>You probably remember me.</i>

3
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,458
<i>I'm Stacy, that baker from Chicago,</i>

4
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:39,833
<i>who flew to Belgravia
to enter a baking contest,</i>

5
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:44,333
<i>but then switched places with Margaret,
the Duchess of Montenaro,</i>

6
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,291
<i>who looks just like me.</i>

7
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:49,291
<i>I'm guessing you remember
I married Prince Edward,</i>

8
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:53,500
<i>and you probably remember that Margaret
fell in love with my best friend Kevin.</i>

9
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:56,000
<i>Cutest couple ever, right?</i>

10
00:00:57,208 --> 00:01:00,125
<i>But what you don't know,
is that since all of that happened,</i>

11
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:02,208
<i>the King of Montenaro died,</i>

12
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,625
<i>and Margaret is now
in line for the throne,</i>

13
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:08,166
<i>which has royally messed up
everything in the romance department.</i>

14
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,833
<i>I've been pretty busy,
but take it from me,</i>

15
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:15,458
<i>happily ever after is never easy.</i>

16
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:19,583
- [chuckles] <i>Especially for a princess.</i>
- [crowd clamoring]

17
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,375
[crowd cheering, applauding]

18
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,000
{\an8}Ladies and gentlemen, it's the moment
we've all been waiting for!

19
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:38,291
{\an8}The final results of Belgravia's 59th
Annual International Baking Competition!

20
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:45,333
And here to announce the winner
is head judge and past champion,

21
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:50,458
Stacy De Novo Wyndham,
Princess of Belgravia!

22
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:52,291
[in American accent]
Thank you.

23
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:58,583
Thank you.

24
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:00,958
We are so pleased

25
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:05,291
that these incredible bakers have come
from all over the world this Christmas.

26
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,625
[crowd cheering, applauding in distance]

27
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,500
Christmas is about giving...

28
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,750
[in distance]
...and this year's contestants

29
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:16,875
have given us creativity,
excellence and artistry.

30
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,750
So without further ado,

31
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:24,166
our first prize winner is someone
I competed against two years ago.

32
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:28,458
This year he has created a cake
that is very special to me.

33
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:33,250
The first time I kissed my husband
Prince Edward was under the mistletoe.

34
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:40,166
Everyone, give it up for Zach Brachmann
from Munich, Germany

35
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,000
and his mistletoe masterpiece.

36
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,875
[crowd cheering, applauding]

37
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,291
Congratulations.

38
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:53,875
Congratulations.

39
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,833
You were positively charming today,
darling.

40
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,291
All I did was hand out some ribbons.

41
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,791
I'm just sorry I didn't get to see
the whole ceremony.

42
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,041
Yeah, parliament ran over, yet again.

43
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,916
It's all good.

44
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,750
Well, I don't know if it is,

45
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,625
with my taking on more
of the king's responsibilities

46
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,875
and you running the royal charities
and your bake shop, there…

47
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,250
There hasn't been much time
for the two of us.

48
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,583
Well, what we do is important.

49
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:40,000
We're important too.
I don't want to lose that.

50
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,916
Well, the good news is we'll be
in Montenaro by the end of the week.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,041
- Hmm.
- We'll have plenty of time together.

52
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:50,458
Christmas in Montenaro
sounds absolutely enchanting.

53
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,291
It does.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,166
- But I'm worried about Margaret.
- Why?

55
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,041
Well, have you seen this?

56
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,166
[Edward]
"Is the Duchess ready to rule?"

57
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:03,541
And this?

58
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,541
Margaret never expected to be queen.

59
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,500
Remember how much she hated the spotlight?

60
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,708
Well, with her coronation
televised on Christmas Day,

61
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,916
she's going to have to
get used to it pretty quickly.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,833
[chuckles]

63
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,166
She just sounded so sad when I called her.

64
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,166
King Dennis died

65
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,291
- and Prince Howard abdicated so…
- Yeah.

66
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,458
…like it or not, she's next
in the line of succession.

67
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,375
Remind me, why are we talking
about Margaret again right now?

68
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,583
Because I can't sleep when I'm worried.

69
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,375
Well, there are…

70
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:40,125
Other things we might do
to relieve your anxiety

71
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,000
besides talking about Lady Margaret.

72
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,333
To tell you the truth.
I think she's not over Kevin.

73
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:48,083
I mean, the breakup must have been
incredibly hard for both of them.

74
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,916
- We could light a fire.
- She was about to move to Chicago.

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,458
- We could open a bottle of wine?
- They were almost engaged.

76
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:54,875
We could put on some music.

77
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,583
Did you know Kevin
was shopping for a ring?

78
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,000
- Stacy!
- What?

79
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:01,666
They went their separate ways.
People do it all the time.

80
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,375
I know. It's just…

81
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,541
Olivia texts me every single day.

82
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,208
She says that her dad's
miserable without Margaret.

83
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,541
He turned down the invitation
to the coronation.

84
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:16,291
- Apparently, he doesn't want to see her.
- Well, men never know what they want.

85
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,125
I know what I want.

86
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,541
I have a great idea.

87
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:26,458
Why don't we take a teeny tiny
little detour to Chicago

88
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,916
on our way to Montenaro?

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,791
Oh, darling. I wish I could
get away sooner. I really do.

90
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,750
But… Unless you want to go
to Chicago without me…

91
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,000
[both laugh]

92
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:41,666
Ooh! Yay! I'm gonna pack and catch
the first flight out in the morning.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,458
{\an8}<i>♪ Feelin' naughty and nice ♪</i>

94
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:47,208
{\an8}<i>♪ Either way it feels right
When you're sitting next to me ♪</i>

95
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,500
<i>♪ By the fire at night

96
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,833

97
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,166
<i>♪ Could be stormy outside

98
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,291
[woman]
Thanks so much. Merry Christmas.

99
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,083
[girl] Thanks and Merry Christmas.

100
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,083
A dozen Christmas cookies, please!

101
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,083
Stacy?

102
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,083
[Stacy chuckles] Hi!

103
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,416
- I missed you!
- I missed you.

104
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,708
Stacy! What are you doing here?

105
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,750
I was in the neighborhood and thought
I'd check on my business partner.

106
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:20,000
- I love the new location, by the way.
- Thanks. Where's Edward?

107
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,458
He's meeting me in London
on our way to Montenaro.

108
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,916
- Ooh.
- Well, you look fantastic.

109
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,583
Thanks, and you look…

110
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,333
Comfortable.

111
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,541
Yeah, it's all good.

112
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:34,750
He hasn't gone on a date since
the breakup with you-know-who.

113
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,750
I have a business to run. Remember?

114
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,250
[Stacy] Come on, Kev.
Life isn't about working all the time.

115
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:44,166
I know, which is why we're adopting
another cat for Christmas.

116
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:45,875
Another cat?

117
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,916
Yeah. You can never have too many cats.

118
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,125
We need to talk.

119
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,708
How about you go and wipe down
one of those tables over there?

120
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,791
[groans]

121
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,375
So, what's up?

122
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:07,083
Well, you're wearing sweatpants,
you won't date and you're collecting cats.

123
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,208
And?

124
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:15,000
Two years ago, you handed me
an invitation that changed my life.

125
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,958
It's time for me to return the favor.

126
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,958
Stace, Margaret and I
called it quits six months ago.

127
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,625
Yeah, which is probably the dumbest thing
you've ever done in your life.

128
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,166
We just didn't want
the same things anymore.

129
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,958
Besides, I mean, she's moved on.
I've moved on.

130
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,625
- Really?
- Yeah.

131
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,916
'Cause you don't look
like you've moved on.

132
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,125
I've already sent the RSVP.

133
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:47,250
[clears throat] About that RSVP…

134
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,458
It kind of never made it to the mailbox.

135
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,083
Liv…

136
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:56,541
Kevin, go to the coronation as her friend.

137
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,958
[sighs] I don't know.

138
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,291
Inheriting the throne is huge.

139
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:06,416
Margaret needs us to be there for her,
all of us.

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,083
[Olivia] Please, Daddy.

141
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,250
She's my friend too.

142
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,208
- Fine.
- [Olivia and Stacy giggle]

143
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:20,291
Hey! Call the cat sitter.

144
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:24,708
Maybe before we leave, you should get,
like, a haircut and a real pair of pants.

145
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,125
What's wrong with these?

146
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,458
Thank you, Frank.

147
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,333
Wow.

148
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:03,583
[Margaret] Stacy!

149
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,375
[in British accent]
I'm so happy you're here.

150
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,541
Me too.

151
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,416
I was afraid you'd be too busy
to manage it.

152
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,458
- Oh, nonsense.
- There's no way we'd miss your coronation.

153
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,208
Which is exactly what I told her.

154
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,416
Mrs. Donatelli, you look amazing.

155
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,583
Oh, thank you. And you look positively
radiant, Your Royal Highness.

156
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,583
Well, Stacy was born to be a princess.

157
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,583
It feels like ages since I saw you.

158
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:34,375
Well, we're here now
and, uh, we brought you a little surprise.

159
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,750
- Olivia!
- Margaret!

160
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,291
Look at you! Oh!

161
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,666
She's grown up since you last saw her.

162
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,708
Indeed she has.

163
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,708
When we didn't receive your RSVP,
we weren't sure you were coming.

164
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,041
I hope it's okay that we're here…

165
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,500
As friends.

166
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,458
[chuckles]

167
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,791
Of course, it is. As friends.

168
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,250
Can we see your palace?

169
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,791
- [laughs]
- [Margaret] Right this way.

170
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,166
Hello!

171
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,708
[Stacy]
Margaret, why is everything covered?

There is, but I stopped the staff
from decorating the residence.

Honestly, I was thinking of canceling
the festivities…

the loss of their king.

for the last three years.

00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,708
I hate to interrupt
the smooch fest, but…

349
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:17,750
Ta-da!

350
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,666
- That is one serious party dress!
- Right? And look at my dad.

351
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,333
- Ta-da!
- You'd better.

352
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:33,375
[fanfare trumpeting]

353
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:39,500
Her Royal Highness,
Lady Margaret Delacourt.

354
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:43,333
[playing fanfare]

355
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,333
[guests applauding]

356
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,541
- [man] Your Highness.
- [woman] Your Highness

357
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,666
Now's your moment.

358
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,458
- My moment for what?
- Ask her to dance.

359
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,000
- Go. Kevin!
- [Kevin] Uh...

360
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:12,916
[Edward chuckles]

361
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,666
I must say you are the most beautiful
monarch in the history of Montenaro.

362
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,125
Oh...

363
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:28,000
I've heard that our first queen,
Judith the Brave, rivaled Helen of Troy.

364
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:31,041
Yeah, but her dance moves
really sucked, though.

365
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,000
[laughs]

366
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,166
Let's show them how it's done.

367
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,625
All right. If you'll excuse me.

368
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,333
Here we go.

369
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,541
[classical arrangement
of "Silent Night" playing]

370
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,500
I'm really happy
you decided to be a part of all this.

371
00:20:58,958 --> 00:20:59,791
Me too.

372
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,958
To tell you the truth, I…

373
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,458
Wasn't sure we could still be friends.

374
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,250
Yeah, things got complicated
after the whole queen thing happened.

375
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,500
I suppose they did.

376
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:18,375
Things used to be so spontaneous for us.

377
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:21,750
Well, here's an idea.
Why don't we go back to spontaneous?

378
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,291
How?

379
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:26,458
Well, if you have time tomorrow,
maybe we can go for a drive.

380
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,333
As friends?

381
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,291
Sure, as friends.

382
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,125
Sounds like a lovely idea.

383
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,958
What could possibly come between two
people who look at each other like that?

384
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:48,833
[in British accent] Yo, let's get
this party started, shall we?

385
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:57,750
Excuse you.

386
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,375
Announce me.

387
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:01,458
- I...
- Do the thing.

388
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,541
[scoffs] Never mind.

389
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:03,833
[gasps]

390
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:05,791
Uh...

391
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,375
[coos] Maggie Moo!

392
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,125
- [laughs softly]
- Ooh!

393
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,000
- [sighs]
- [chuckles]

394
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,750
Here we go.

395
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,375
- Must we really do this?
- Pics or it didn't happen.

396
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:24,666
Say <i>fromage!</i>

397
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,625
[camera clicks]

398
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:28,166
[groans]

399
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,250
Double chin! That's a delete.

400
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:34,958
But no worries, it happens.
Not to me, but it happens.

401
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:39,333
Fiona, I'm so… elated you could make it.

402
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:43,166
Oh, you certainly have learned
how to throw a party. So proud of you.

403
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,375
Proceeds from tonight's event
go to one of the royal charities.

404
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:49,416
There's an orphanage
in particular need, St. Michael's.

405
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,708
We're running a toy drive.

406
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:54,500
Of course you are,
you cute little Mother Teresa.

407
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,041
How long are you in town for?

408
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:00,041
Until your big day.

409
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,416
And then we jet off
to Capri for the New Year's,

410
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,875
but I fully intend to spend as much time
as possible with my favorite little cuzzy.

411
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,666
[chuckles] Lucky me.

412
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,708
Well, hello, tuxedo man.

413
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,208
Me?

414
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,250
This is my friend Kevin,

415
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:20,958
his daughter Olivia, Princess Stacy
and Prince Edward of Belgravia.

416
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:23,958
Everyone,
this is my cousin Fiona Pembroke.

417
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:27,916
Pembroke as in Lord Percival Pembroke?

418
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,333
- The one who died of a peanut allergy?
- [Margaret] Her father, my uncle.

419
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:33,291
Oh my God,

420
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:37,083
you're the one who switched
places with my cuzzy!

421
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,916
[chuckles] That's me.

422
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,416
You two seriously look like twins! Spoopy!

423
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:44,541
It means spooky.

424
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:50,625
Have you two done the switch thing since
you tied the knot with his Royal Hotness?

425
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,500
- [Edward chuckles]
- Fiona, please!

426
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,583
Minions, I need more champagne.

427
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:00,166
[scoffs] Reggie, Mindy!

428
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,458
Oh yeah, gorgeous.

429
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:06,000
Oh, it's such a pain
to find good help these days.

430
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,625
You're yummy.

431
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:11,750
[growls]

432
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,250
Wow!

433
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,625
I mean, I can see the family resemblance.

434
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,500
You can't miss it.

435
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,791
But is she really related to you?

436
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,625
Fiona's always been a free spirit.

437
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:26,666
She inherited quite the fortune
when my uncle died.

438
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,416
Guessing there isn't much of it left.

439
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,708
[Margaret] There isn't.

440
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:32,958
Though she still has the old
Pembroke Estate in the country.

441
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:36,708
She keeps Reggie and Mindy on staff,
but I've no idea how she pays them.

442
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:39,375
Your Highness,
I apologize for disturbing you.

443
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:41,458
The Prime Minister is asking for you.

444
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:42,375
Of course.

445
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:45,708
I have a meeting
with the Treasury tomorrow morning.

446
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:47,208
Shall we say two o'clock?

447
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:48,666
You got it.

448
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:54,250
[men] Cheers.

449
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:58,000
[woman] Mm, lovely.

450
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:00,916
- [man] Are you having a good time?
- [woman 1] Yes, I am.

451
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:02,708
Oh, stop it!

452
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:06,708
[indistinct chatter]

453
00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:07,958
[woman 2] So sweet.

454
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:09,041
[woman 2 giggles]

455
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,333
Is that all of it?

456
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:24,625
The place was dripping with money.

457
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:30,500
[gasps] How did you…

458
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:35,625
- [groans] Never mind. And you?
- Hmm.

459
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,708
Explain to me how this is
going to pay for a summer in Capri.

460
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:43,791
- It's double ply.
- And your point is?

461
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,000
It's double ply!

462
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:48,750
I'm so tired of this!

463
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:52,208
If you're tired, Mindy,
then come up with something better.

464
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:55,000
I can't be the looks
and brains of this operation.

465
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:56,166
I thought I was the looks!

466
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,416
And that's why you're not the brains.

467
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,291
Why can't you be the one who gets to be
queen instead of your stupid cousin?

468
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:03,625
Then we'd be set for life.

469
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:05,291
Just stop talking.

470
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:06,916
Leave me.

471
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,125
[door opens]

472
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:17,458
[sighs]

473
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:20,208
[door closes]

474
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,208
[door opens]

475
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:34,875
[door closes]

476
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:39,000
How was the Treasury meeting?

477
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,833
I've spent the last several months

478
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:45,208
analyzing the impact
of tariffs on the trade deficit.

479
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:48,166
No one's even asked for my opinion.

480
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,291
They will.

481
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,125
How do you know?

482
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:52,833
Because I know you.

483
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,333
Margaret…

484
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,625
I've been thinking, and, um…

485
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,458
[Antonio] There you are.

486
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,625
I've been looking everywhere for you.

487
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:05,458
[Margaret] Is everything all right?

488
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,541
I hate to bother you… again.

489
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:13,166
But… there's an urgent matter
requiring your immediate attention.

490
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:15,125
We'll be back in an hour.

491
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:16,583
[chuckles]

492
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:18,541
It really can't wait.

493
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:22,416
I'm so sorry.

494
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,166
Hey. Do what you have to.

495
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,583
I thought there was something urgent.

496
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,833
There is, but it's not what you think.

497
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:53,458
I knew if I didn't do this now,
I'd lose my nerve.

498
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,458
What's this all about?

499
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:00,916
Margaret, I'd be lying…

500
00:28:01,791 --> 00:28:05,166
If I told you I served you
only out of a sense of duty.

501
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:10,291
You're not just about to become
the Queen of Montenaro,

502
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:14,125
you've also become
the queen of my heart.

503
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:16,125
Tony.

504
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:17,708
This is for you.

505
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:21,125
I was going to give it
to you at Christmas,

506
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:23,583
but… I want you to have it now.

507
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,666
Oh.

508
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,375
It's beautiful.

509
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:37,125
We've been friends
for a long time now, you and I…

510
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:42,041
But lately I've been wishing
we could be something more.

511
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:47,000
Oh. I, uh...

512
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:51,000
I really don't know what to think.

513
00:28:52,541 --> 00:28:54,750
I'm rather confused about everything.

514
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:58,000
Does…

515
00:28:58,541 --> 00:29:01,583
Everything include that friend of yours?

516
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:03,333
I don't know.

517
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,125
Maybe…

518
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:08,125
Margaret…

519
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,125
It's all right.

520
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,333
It's such a relief to hear you say that.

521
00:29:14,916 --> 00:29:19,291
You know, we'd make a fantastic couple,
you and I.

522
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,708
- Everyone says so.
- [laughs]

523
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:26,083
Just promise me…

524
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:28,208
You'll at least consider it.

525
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:32,375
All right.

526
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,416
What was I supposed to say?

527
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,500
I thought you and Antonio
weren't a thing.

528
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:40,541
We're not,

529
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,625
but Tony's been a huge help to me.

530
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:46,375
Don't you think
he's trying just a little too hard?

531
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:47,291
[laughs]

532
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:50,875
Tony's always spent a bit
too much on things he shouldn't,

533
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:52,750
but we've known each other
since university.

534
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,125
But maybe he's right.

535
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:58,458
Maybe we could be good for each other.

536
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:01,166
You and Kevin are good for each other.

537
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:04,125
There's so much water
under the bridge, Stacy.

538
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:08,375
Kevin and I haven't even begun to talk
about what went wrong between us,

539
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:12,333
and every time we try, we never get
a chance to finish our conversation.

540
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:14,625
I don't know if we ever will.

541
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:16,750
Well, maybe you need to try harder.

542
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:20,541
Is love really supposed
to take so much effort?

543
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:24,458
Look, I know it in my heart.

544
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:26,791
You and Kevin are meant to be.

545
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,250
And I used to know it too,

546
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:32,583
but maybe all we're meant to be
is a happy memory.

547
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:44,500
I got your message. You wanted to see me?

548
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:46,666
I did.

549
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,875
Thank you for coming.

550
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,750
- What's up?
- This is terribly hard to say,

551
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:54,958
but here it is.

552
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:59,000
I'm not sure
you're being fair to Lady Margaret.

553
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:01,166
You want to explain that?

554
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:06,000
I know the two of you
were involved for a time and…

555
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:10,125
I can tell the relationship
was very meaningful.

556
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:11,791
But, uh…

557
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,833
But what?

558
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,541
Could it be that you're holding her back?

559
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:23,000
If that's the way she felt, she'd tell me.

560
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,500
Yeah, uh...

561
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:28,541
Lady Margaret's very confused right now.

562
00:31:29,541 --> 00:31:32,833
I'm certain she doesn't want
to hurt your feelings, but, uh…

563
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,958
Have you really considered
what's best for her?

564
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:41,041
Let me guess, you're what's best for her?

565
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:46,083
Look, I know you care deeply for her,
Mr. Richards, but…

566
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:49,125
When affairs of state overwhelm her,

567
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:52,791
are you really sure
you're the one she should turn to?

568
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:56,041
You're a baker from Chicago,

569
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,500
and I'm certain a very good one,

570
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:03,958
but… are you truly
a consort for a queen?

571
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:10,458
[knocking]

572
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:11,416
[Stacy] <i>Come in.</i>

573
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,333
Hey, what's up, kiddo?

574
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:15,958
[Olivia] We gotta talk.

575
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:17,208
Now!

576
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:21,708
About what?

577
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:26,250
Operation "Get Dad Back Together With
Margaret," it's going to crash and burn.

578
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:27,708
Yeah, tell me about it.

579
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:30,000
But I have an idea.

580
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,041
You want us to do what?

581
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:35,500
Switch places again.

582
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:39,250
You said you needed more time
to talk things over with Kevin,

583
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,916
but you can't do that
because you're too busy.

584
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,375
So Stacy can be you,

585
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:47,291
and you and my dad
can spend some quality time together.

586
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:49,166
It's terribly risky.

587
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,708
It was risky the last time
and you're the one who thought of it.

588
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:56,458
Yes, but you're a princess now
and I'm about to become queen.

589
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,958
We can't just stop everything
and swap lives.

590
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:01,041
Why not?

591
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:03,875
With everything
that's going on with Tony...

592
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:04,958
[Stacy] Margaret…

593
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:08,708
If you know for sure
that it's over with Kevin

594
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:11,041
and you want to get serious with Antonio,

595
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:13,541
we won't say another word about this.

596
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:16,375
Do you really think we could pull it off?

597
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:17,833
Again?

598
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:21,833
Well, the only thing on your schedule
tomorrow is the Christmas concert.

599
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,583
All you have to do
is sit and wave to people.

600
00:33:24,666 --> 00:33:27,166
Yeah, and when it's over Mrs. Donatelli
will walk you...

601
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:31,000
I mean, me, through the reception
and then it's back to the palace.

602
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:34,625
That way, you and Kevin have
plenty of alone time together.

603
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:36,416
And then we switch back.

604
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,375
I suppose it could work.

605
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:42,541
Does that mean you'll do it?

606
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:46,416
Did you talk this over with Kevin?

607
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,833
[laughs]

608
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:50,500
Did you talk this over with Margaret?

609
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:53,125
Yeah, and she's good to go if you are.

610
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:55,458
[sighs] I don't know.

611
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:58,625
- Maybe she's better off with Antonio.
- [Stacy groans]

612
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:00,958
He's a nice guy.

613
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:03,333
- Yeah, well, you're a nicer guy.
- Yeah!

614
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:06,041
[scoffs]

615
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,541
Did you tell Edward about this?

616
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:12,833
The less people who know, the better.

617
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:15,000
Yeah, I'll fake a cold or something.

618
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,416
Look, it'll only be for a few hours.

619
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,958
Okay, and I'll tell him everything
as soon as it's over.

620
00:34:23,458 --> 00:34:24,833
You need to do this, Daddy.

621
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:32,416
If Margaret's in…

622
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:34,333
- I'm in.
- Yay!

623
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:35,583
[squeals, grunts]

624
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:37,791
[all laughing]

625
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:46,625
Oh, there you are, darling!
Been looking all over for you!

626
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:49,500
Oh, well, you know me. Always busy!

627
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:52,791
- Yes. That's what I wanted to talk about.
- Can we talk about it later?

628
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:57,125
I was just on my way to the kitchen
to do some Christmas baking.

629
00:34:57,208 --> 00:35:00,000
Well, I was actually hoping
we might be able to find a moment

630
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:01,583
to do something together.

631
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,875
We will. I promise. As soon
as I'm done in the kitchen, okay?

632
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:07,208
Why the change of clothes?

633
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:10,541
Oh, what, these old things?

634
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:13,791
I am donating them to the orphanage.

635
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:16,041
I better get them to Frank.
He's coordinating everything.

636
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:18,541
Didn't I get you that scarf
last Christmas?

637
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:24,375
You did. I love it so much, I got
another one to donate to the orphans.

638
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:27,875
Yeah. I love you. Bye.

- [audio feedback squealing]
- Hey, what did you do that for?

644
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:52,250
Do I really need to explain?

645
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:55,458
- [Reggie] Everyone's a critic.
- [Fiona] Ever wonder why?

646
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:56,416
No.

647
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,583
Well, maybe you should.

648
00:35:57,666 --> 00:35:59,625
- Well, maybe I shouldn't.
- Maybe you should.

649
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:01,708
- Maybe I shouldn't.
- Maybe you should, mate.

650
00:36:01,791 --> 00:36:03,375
- Maybe I shouldn't.
- I think you should.

651
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:07,250
- I'm not going to...
- Maybe you should both shut up and listen!

652
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:10,083
Well, if you've got something to say,
Fi-Fi, just spit it out.

653
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:11,041
[makes buzzing noise]

654
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:14,250
I figured it out.

655
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:15,458
Figured what out?

656
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,416
Well, our big score.

657
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,250
I'm listening.

658
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:22,916
Remember when you said
if I were Margaret, we'd be set?

659
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,416
Uh... [laughs]

660
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,000
Yeah, but, um… you're not Margaret.

661
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:29,458
Well, of course
I'm not Margaret, Einstein.

662
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:33,375
But, if Betty Crocker from Belgravia
could pull the switch,

663
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,250
why can't I?

664
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:37,375
I'm not feeling it.

665
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:38,291
[groans]

666
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:42,375
[chuckles]

667
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:44,875
My Ariana Grande phase.

668
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:45,791
[Reggie] Hmm.

669
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:50,375
I wouldn't have to do it for long, just
long enough to get crowned queen

670
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:54,791
and transfer a small fortune to an
unnumbered bank account in the Caymans.

671
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:57,000
Oh, I'm starting to feel it!

672
00:36:57,083 --> 00:37:01,416
Then we spend the rest of our lives
sipping piña coladas on a beach

673
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,458
in a country that doesn't have
an extradition policy.

674
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:06,416
Yeah, baby!

675
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:10,250
You're first cousins, so you know
the family history, right?

676
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:11,166
Hmm.

677
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:14,625
You're welcome,
and you grew up here with Margaret

678
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:16,708
before you went to school in the States.

679
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:21,541
So, we do the hair, we lose the nails
and the contouring,

680
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:23,541
which is the only thing
giving her cheekbones.

681
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:24,458
Excuse you!

682
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:28,125
And no one's gonna notice
the little extra junk in the trunk.

683
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:30,416
- What are you saying?
- Hey, I'm agreeing with you!

684
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,416
Hold on!

685
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,541
We've got a big, big problem here.

686
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:37,166
Well, spit it out.

687
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,666
Cousin Mags ain't gonna go along
with any of this.

688
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,333
Which is why you'll have to grab her
and stash her somewhere.

689
00:37:43,416 --> 00:37:44,666
And to do that,

690
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:47,083
I'm gonna need to know
exactly where she's gonna be

691
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:49,875
and what she's gonna be doing
for the next few days.

692
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:52,791
That shouldn't be
terribly difficult to find out.

693
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:10,166
Maggie! Maggie Moo! It's your cuzzy!

694

- No worries, Royal Six-Pack.

There is a reception afterwards
if you'd like to catch up with her then.

705
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:46,333
Hmm. I do love a good reception.

706

Yes, I was just looking for her, actually.

at some silly little contest?

over a spilt cup of coffee.

Thank you.

869
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:07,166
Welcome to Santa's Magic Village.
And we have the whole place to ourselves.

870
00:48:08,041 --> 00:48:09,708
[in British accent]
How did you manage it?

871
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:11,166
Mrs. Donatelli. [laughs]

872
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:12,583
That woman rocks.

873
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:14,083
Indeed she does.

Kevin…

875
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:20,208
I'm so sorry about canceling yesterday.

876
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:22,291
We're here now. That's all that counts.

877
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:24,583
All right.

878
00:48:26,625 --> 00:48:29,000
[Kevin] So what do you want to do first?

879
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:33,666
We can string some popcorn,
pet a reindeer, visit the North Pole…

Olivia, is there some reason you don't
want me to speak to Stacy?

890

No…

891
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,166
I didn't want to say anything, but…

892
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:09,041
You're being a little bit
of a helicopter husband.

893
00:49:09,125 --> 00:49:10,041
Sorry, what?

894
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:11,416
A helicopter husband.

895
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,666
You know, someone who hovers around and…

896
00:49:15,166 --> 00:49:17,000
Doesn't give the other person
room to breathe.

897
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:19,750

Perhaps we should have dinner out as well,

902
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:31,166
I have lots of friends.

What do you think?

I like her smile.

She hasn't smiled in quite a while.

Because he told me
he had the same problem.

No.

The truth is…

There's no one else in the world
I'd rather be with.

936

That's not what you said six months ago.

I thought we were going to live

Things were going good until your cousin
decided he didn't want to be king.

How could you ever hold me back?

[groans]

1046
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:48,125
Meow!

1047
00:57:50,416 --> 00:57:51,291
[moans softly]

1048
00:58:03,583 --> 00:58:04,541
[moans]

1049
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:06,250
Come to Mommy.

1050
00:58:09,666 --> 00:58:10,958
[coos]

1051
00:58:11,041 --> 00:58:13,416
- [door opens]
- [Margaret] Stacy, I'm back!

1052
00:58:14,416 --> 00:58:17,333
- Who is it?
- It's me, Margaret.

1053
00:58:34,041 --> 00:58:36,666
I had the most enchanting time of my life.

1054
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:39,291
Oh, my…

1055
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:42,333
Kevin is the most wonderful man
in the world.

1056
00:58:43,875 --> 00:58:45,958
You were absolutely right.

1057
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:48,458
All we needed was a little time together.

1058
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:52,291
I've never been happier in my life.

1059
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:56,375
And I owe it all to you, you darling girl.

1060
00:58:56,958 --> 00:58:58,958
Well, you and Olivia.

1061
00:58:59,041 --> 00:59:03,416
Oh, Stacy, I'm so glad
you talked me into switching places.

1062
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:06,916
Did…

1063
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,875
Did I really have to talk you
into switching places?

1064
00:59:12,541 --> 00:59:15,833
I was honestly terrified
we wouldn't be able to pull it off again,

1065
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:18,541
but apparently we did.

1066
00:59:20,166 --> 00:59:21,041
Apparently.

1067
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:24,416
I hope the Christmas concert
wasn't too much trouble.

1068
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,291
I love a good concert.

1069
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:29,708
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I need to change for dinner.

1070
00:59:29,791 --> 00:59:31,375
I don't want to keep Kevin waiting.

1071
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,375
By the way, your accent is much better.

1072
00:59:38,333 --> 00:59:39,541
Dinner with Kevin?

1073
00:59:40,375 --> 00:59:42,833
Aren't you the least bit concerned
about Edward?

1074
00:59:44,291 --> 00:59:46,625
What has any of this got
to do with Edward?

1075
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,958
He is your husband after all.

1076
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:51,083
Don't be silly.

1077
00:59:51,166 --> 00:59:52,083
Stacy.

1078
00:59:53,125 --> 00:59:55,708
You know how much
I treasure our friendship,

1079
00:59:56,291 --> 00:59:59,625
but barging in here and going on about
how you're planning to cheat on Edward.

1080
00:59:59,708 --> 01:00:00,708
Well...

1081
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:02,708
I think you better go.

1082
01:00:03,958 --> 01:00:05,958
Stacy, the game is over.

1083
01:00:06,041 --> 01:00:09,541
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

1084
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:13,000
This isn't funny.
It's time to switch back.

1085
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:16,416
I insist you take your leave at once.

1086
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,166
You must be joking.

1087
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:21,291
Or would you rather I call the guard
and have you thrown out?

1088
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:25,916
[sighs]

1089
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,750
That won't be necessary.

1090
01:00:38,666 --> 01:00:39,708
[groans]

1091
01:00:43,625 --> 01:00:44,500
[thuds]

1092
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:45,416
[grunts]

1093
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:49,000
We are so screwed!

1094
01:00:49,083 --> 01:00:51,375
You're such a drama queen.

1095
01:00:51,458 --> 01:00:53,500
We grabbed the wrong Maggie.

1096
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:57,041
This one's got free Wi-Fi
and Taco Tuesdays.

1097
01:00:57,125 --> 01:00:58,625
Oh, and a cabana boy!

1098
01:00:58,708 --> 01:01:01,791
You're not going to need
a cabana boy in prison.

1099
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:04,708
So, would you two
please stop talking and focus?

1100
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:07,875
All right, Fi-Fi!
There's no reason to get testy.

1101
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:08,833
[huffs]

1102
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:10,166
Really, Reggie?

1103
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,666
Because I think there is.

1104
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:13,750
I think there's a very big reason.

1105
01:01:13,833 --> 01:01:17,000
If your cousin's there,
then who've we got in the basement?

1106
01:01:17,083 --> 01:01:19,625
Well, the look-alike from Belgravia.

1107
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:23,166
She did say you grabbed the wrong person.

1108
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:24,708
Me?

1109
01:01:25,291 --> 01:01:27,666
- So now it's my fault?
- Well, it's not mine.

1110
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,500
- [Reggie] <i>It's not mine!</i>
- [Mindy] <i>Yes, it is.</i>

1111
01:01:29,583 --> 01:01:30,916
- [Reggie] <i>I's not!</i>
- [Mindy] <i>It is.</i>

1112
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,250
- No, it's not. I was following you!
- It's 'cause you said...

1113
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:36,375
[grunts] We need a plan.

1114
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:37,500
All right…

1115
01:01:39,375 --> 01:01:41,916
You said this was a get-in,
get-out job, right?

1116
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:42,833
So?

1117
01:01:42,916 --> 01:01:45,375
So all you have to do is get out faster.

1118
01:01:45,458 --> 01:01:49,166
Well, no can do.
The coronation isn't till tomorrow.

1119
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:51,041
So move it up to tonight.

1120
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:53,458
And how am I supposed to do that?

1121
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:56,375
Hello? You're going to be queen.

1122
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:57,875
<i>You make the rules.</i>

1123
01:01:58,375 --> 01:02:00,791
I do, don't I?

1124
01:02:06,541 --> 01:02:07,625
Hmm.

1125
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:10,958
But first I've got some
dinner plans to cancel.

1126
01:02:21,416 --> 01:02:22,250
Darling!

1127
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,791
- So glad your headache's better.
- There's something I have to tell you.

1128
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,291
[Edward] Let me go first.

1129
01:02:27,708 --> 01:02:28,541
[sighs]

1130
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:31,458
I need to apologize
if I've hovered too much,

1131
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:36,416
you know, like a helicopter,
circling about and buzzing all the while.

1132
01:02:37,916 --> 01:02:41,041
Why are you speaking
with a different accent?

1133
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:43,708
I'm not speaking with an accent.
I'm Margaret.

1134
01:02:43,791 --> 01:02:44,750
[laughs]

1135
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:45,916
Don't be silly.

1136
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:48,916
Why won't anyone believe me?

1137
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:51,916
- You're serious.
- Yeah.

1138
01:02:52,416 --> 01:02:54,208
I've never been more serious in my life.

1139
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:58,458
- But Stacy promised me that she'd never...
- It's my fault.

1140
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:01,958
I needed time with Kevin
and Stacy was only trying to help.

1141
01:03:03,041 --> 01:03:04,333
No one was supposed to know.

1142
01:03:04,958 --> 01:03:07,208
If no one's supposed to know,
why are you telling me now?

1143
01:03:07,291 --> 01:03:09,125
There's been a bit of a snag.

1144
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:12,583
Well, a rather major snag to be precise.

1145
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:15,166
[Frank]
Come on now, remember our chat.

1146
01:03:16,166 --> 01:03:18,500
- Twenty-five years...
- Come on, happy face.

1147
01:03:18,583 --> 01:03:20,208
Mrs. Donatelli? Are you all right?

1148
01:03:21,125 --> 01:03:22,000
No.

1149
01:03:23,041 --> 01:03:25,291
No, I am most certainly not all right.

1150
01:03:25,375 --> 01:03:27,500
The most awful thing has happened.

1151
01:03:27,583 --> 01:03:30,791
After 25 years of loyal service,
Lady Margaret has…

1152
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:33,625
Well, she's given me the boot.

1153
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:36,333
She says that she doesn't need me anymore,

1154
01:03:36,416 --> 01:03:38,708
and she's moved the coronation
up to tonight

1155
01:03:38,791 --> 01:03:41,000
so that she can spend Christmas
with the orphans.

1156
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:44,041
I would never fire you, Mrs. Donatelli,

1157
01:03:44,125 --> 01:03:46,791
and I certainly am not moving up
my coronation.

1158
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:48,208
[gasps]

1159
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:50,458
Lady Margaret?

1160
01:03:51,625 --> 01:03:52,750
Oh. [laughs]

1161
01:03:53,416 --> 01:03:54,416
[sighs] Oh.

1162
01:03:55,625 --> 01:03:58,500
- And… he knows?
- Yes.

1163
01:03:59,875 --> 01:04:01,791
- And you've not switched back yet?
- No.

1164
01:04:01,875 --> 01:04:05,583
And I can assure you the woman upstairs
in my suite is not Princess Stacy,

1165
01:04:05,666 --> 01:04:08,333
unless she's gone
completely off her trolley.

1166
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,583
Let me see if I follow this, so…

1167
01:04:12,375 --> 01:04:14,416
If the two of you haven't switched back

1168
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:16,708
and this is Lady Margaret,

1169
01:04:17,458 --> 01:04:21,000
and if Lady Margaret upstairs isn't Stacy,

1170
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:24,500
who's upstairs and where's my wife?

1171
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:26,958
Off with their heads.

1172
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:28,666
[laughs]

1173
01:04:29,291 --> 01:04:30,375
[knocking]

1174
01:04:30,458 --> 01:04:31,291
Who...

1175
01:04:32,416 --> 01:04:34,291
- Who is it?
- It's Kevin.

1176
01:04:43,541 --> 01:04:44,375
Come in.

1177
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:49,625
I know, I'm kind of early but…

1178
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,333
Oh! I can come back later if...

1179
01:04:52,416 --> 01:04:54,166
No, Kevin, please stay.

1180
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:56,458
There's something we need to discuss.

1181
01:04:57,208 --> 01:04:58,416
Yeah. Sure.

1182
01:04:59,291 --> 01:05:00,125
Everything okay?

1183
01:05:00,708 --> 01:05:02,291
I'm afraid it isn't.

1184
01:05:03,083 --> 01:05:04,041
[gasps]

1185
01:05:05,541 --> 01:05:08,791
The time we spent together today
was truly magical.

1186
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:10,291
Yeah, I thought so too.

1187
01:05:10,875 --> 01:05:12,333
But it isn't right.

1188
01:05:15,166 --> 01:05:17,708
Deep down, we both know it.

1189
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:23,083
You need a wife and your darling
little girl needs a mother.

1190
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:26,875
Like it or not, I have a country to run.

1191
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:31,791
And I can't be the wife
and mother you both deserve.

1192
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:33,500
That's not true.

1193
01:05:33,583 --> 01:05:35,666
Don't make this harder than it is.

1194
01:05:36,958 --> 01:05:39,750
- But you said...
- You must forget what I said.

1195
01:05:40,666 --> 01:05:43,041
I was emotional. I wasn't thinking.

1196
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:47,083
Margaret, this isn't like you.

1197
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:50,083
Please,

1198
01:05:50,666 --> 01:05:53,416
it's best for both of us
if we end this now.

1199
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:59,125
You and Olivia need to go home.

1200
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:01,958
You really mean that?

1201
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:05,833
Because if you do,

1202
01:06:07,041 --> 01:06:08,458
I'm not coming back…

1203
01:06:09,958 --> 01:06:10,791
Ever.

1204
01:06:11,083 --> 01:06:13,375
[sighs] Goodbye, Kevin.

1205
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:33,375
[chuckles]

1206
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:36,833
Bye!

1207
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:45,833
Hello?

1208
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,208
Hello, can anyone hear me?

1209
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:52,041
Hello!

1210
01:07:15,291 --> 01:07:18,000
I still don't understand what happened.

1211
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:22,833
She changed her mind. That's all.

1212
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:27,791
Are you sure she wasn't pranking you?

1213
01:07:27,875 --> 01:07:28,750
Liv…

1214
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:32,708
I know how much
you care about Margaret,

1215
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:35,166
but it's time to let go.

1216
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:37,500
For both of us.

1217
01:07:38,083 --> 01:07:39,916
- But, Daddy...
- Livvie…

1218
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:41,708
let's go.

1219
01:07:43,041 --> 01:07:44,041
Come on.

1220
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:47,416
Get in the car.

1221
01:07:57,333 --> 01:07:58,291
Airport, please.

1222
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:01,041
Very good, sir.

1223
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:10,708
After the concert what happened?

1224
01:08:10,791 --> 01:08:13,375
We were separated for a few minutes
at the reception,

1225
01:08:13,875 --> 01:08:16,708
and then she returned
to the palace in her limousine.

1226
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:17,666
Without you?

1227
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:21,000
I'd been informed that she'd already left.
So I took a separate car.

1228
01:08:21,083 --> 01:08:24,541
So something must have happened
after the concert and before you returned.

1229
01:08:26,291 --> 01:08:27,125
[gasps]

1230
01:08:27,416 --> 01:08:29,958
- The drink!
- Ah-ha! So you were drinking!

1231
01:08:30,041 --> 01:08:32,250
Not me, you fool.

1232
01:08:32,916 --> 01:08:35,958
The man with your cousin Fiona… Reggie.

1233
01:08:36,041 --> 01:08:38,708
- He spilled a drink on your dress.
- Stacy's dress.

1234
01:08:38,791 --> 01:08:43,000
Yes, and then Fiona's secretary
took her to the ladies' room.

1235
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:44,833
- Ah-ha!
- What are you thinking, Frank?

1236
01:08:45,416 --> 01:08:48,083
I have absolutely no idea, sir.

1237
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:49,958
I think I know.

1238
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:53,083
They made the switch
in the powder room.

1239
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:56,083
They kidnapped Stacy
because they thought it was me.

1240
01:08:56,875 --> 01:09:00,125
- So the woman upstairs is your cousin.
- I wouldn't put it past her.

1241
01:09:00,208 --> 01:09:04,375
And underneath all that peroxide,
there is a striking resemblance.

1242
01:09:04,458 --> 01:09:06,708
So if Fiona's associates took Stacy,

1243
01:09:07,666 --> 01:09:08,958
where would they go?

1244
01:09:09,041 --> 01:09:11,541
I'm guessing
they're at her father's old estate.

1245
01:09:11,625 --> 01:09:13,500
It's less than an hour away from here.

1246
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:16,125
Right. I'll get the car.

1247
01:09:16,208 --> 01:09:17,333
I'll deal with Fiona.

1248
01:09:17,416 --> 01:09:20,750
Well, I wouldn't confront her just yet.
Not while they still have Stacy.

1249
01:09:20,833 --> 01:09:23,083
Right, then we'll come with you.

1250
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:27,291
Notify Count Rossi of our suspicions
and have him delay the coronation.

1251
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:28,666
Right away, Your Highness.

1252
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:30,166
Bingo.

1253
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,333
I honestly don't understand the urgency.

1254
01:09:36,416 --> 01:09:38,500
Then I shall review it for you again.

1255
01:09:39,541 --> 01:09:43,916
I intend to spend Christmas with
those poor, poor orphans at St. Matthew's.

1256
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,666
Aren't the orphans at St. Michael's?

1257
01:09:46,833 --> 01:09:48,083
I am in charge

1258
01:09:48,166 --> 01:09:52,500
and you as my loyal subject must do
precisely what I tell you to do.

1259
01:09:53,083 --> 01:09:53,916
[sighs]

1260
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:57,458
I would…

1261
01:09:58,541 --> 01:10:00,333
If you were really Lady Margaret.

1262
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:03,958
But you're not, are you?

1263
01:10:04,791 --> 01:10:06,916
How dare you question me!

1264
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,208
You're Margaret's cousin.

1265
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:09,291
[gasps]

1266
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:11,666
- I'll have you arrested for treason.
- I don't think you will

1267
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,958
- because I can prove it.
- I'm calling the guards!

1268
01:10:14,041 --> 01:10:16,166
All it takes is a close look at your hand.

1269
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:18,500
The little tattoo on your pinkie…

1270
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,500
You should take greater care
to cover it up.

1271
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:27,791
So now what?

1272
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,625
I'm guessing you're after money.

1273
01:10:31,291 --> 01:10:35,208
You're not stupid enough to think that
you can maintain this charade for long.

1274
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:40,208
So you can either make me a partner
in your little scheme

1275
01:10:41,125 --> 01:10:44,625
or be exposed
as an impostor and a traitor.

1276
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:47,875
You don't need my money.
You're filthy rich.

1277
01:10:47,958 --> 01:10:51,458
My eldest brother inherited
the majority of the family estate,

1278
01:10:51,958 --> 01:10:55,791
which left me with expensive tastes
and a very small income.

1279
01:10:56,666 --> 01:10:57,583
[sighs]

1280
01:10:58,833 --> 01:11:00,166
What about Margaret?

1281
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:02,625
Once you've gotten what you came for,

1282
01:11:02,708 --> 01:11:06,750
you'll vanish without a trace, which means
Margaret never has to know anything.

1283
01:11:08,166 --> 01:11:10,708
I'll make sure the coronation
happens tonight.

1284
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:15,375
And afterwards, you'll meet
with the Chancellor of the Exchequer

1285
01:11:15,458 --> 01:11:19,041
and make an incredibly generous donation
to a fictitious charity

1286
01:11:19,125 --> 01:11:21,500
of which you
are the Chief Financial Officer.

1287
01:11:22,333 --> 01:11:25,083
As soon as you write a check to me
for my services,

1288
01:11:25,166 --> 01:11:27,500
I'll arrange for your discreet departure.

1289
01:11:28,708 --> 01:11:31,000
You can do whatever you like
with the rest of the money.

1290
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:38,416
When we arrive, everyone keep alert.

1291
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,500
There's no telling
what we'll find when we get there.

1292
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:44,541
Mm-hmm. And it's a good thing
that these are registered weapons.

1293
01:11:44,625 --> 01:11:46,875
- Frank! Hands on the wheel!
- All right!

1294
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:54,000
[hums softly]

1295
01:11:56,416 --> 01:11:59,000
Your dinner is served.

1296
01:12:01,666 --> 01:12:02,666
Hello?

1297
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:07,125
Your Highnesty?

1298
01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:09,916
Hello?

1299
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:16,125
You playing hide and seek?

1300
01:12:18,958 --> 01:12:20,416
You are!

1301
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:22,333
[Stacy grunts]

1302
01:12:23,541 --> 01:12:26,458
[screaming]

1303
01:12:26,541 --> 01:12:27,958
[grunts]

1304
01:12:28,041 --> 01:12:29,166
[Reggie whimpers]

1305
01:12:31,875 --> 01:12:34,958
[gasping]

1306
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:37,666
[Reggie] Oy!

1307
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:40,375
Oy! Come here!

1308
01:12:40,458 --> 01:12:42,666
- [Stacy panting]
- [Reggie grunting]

1309
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:46,000
Oh my God.

1310
01:12:46,083 --> 01:12:47,250
[Stacy grunts]

1311
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:49,541
[Reggie yelling]

1312
01:12:57,166 --> 01:12:58,125
Is anyone there?

1313
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:01,250
[Reggie] Mindy! Get her!

1314
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:03,166
Where do you think you're going? Oh!

1315
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:04,833
[screaming]

1316
01:13:09,791 --> 01:13:11,458
[Mindy] Help! Help me, Reggie.

1317
01:13:12,416 --> 01:13:16,333
[pounding] Reggie, get me out of here.
Get me out of here. Reggie!

1318
01:13:17,625 --> 01:13:18,708
Oh! Whoa! Oh!

1319
01:13:18,791 --> 01:13:20,125
- Sir…
- [Margaret] Oh dear, Edward!

1320
01:13:20,208 --> 01:13:22,125
Stacy? Can you hear me?

1321
01:13:22,208 --> 01:13:23,666
[panting]

1322
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:24,791
- [Edward] Stacy?
- Thank God.

1323
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:25,750
Come here!

1324
01:13:27,666 --> 01:13:28,541
[screaming]

1325
01:13:28,625 --> 01:13:30,666
They're over there! Go!

1326
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:35,208
- Call the police! Frank, you're with me!
- Always, sir. Always!

1327
01:13:35,291 --> 01:13:37,083
- [Stacy grunts]
- [Edward] Get away from her!

1328
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:41,000
[hollers]

1329
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:42,541
[grunts]

1330
01:13:42,625 --> 01:13:45,458
[groaning]

1331
01:13:47,125 --> 01:13:48,500
[Stacy and Edward gasp]

1332
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:49,833
[Stacy] Oh!

1333
01:13:50,083 --> 01:13:53,083
I'm so sorry.
I should have told you everything.

1334
01:13:53,166 --> 01:13:55,416
As long as you're all right,
that's all that matters.

1335
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:59,458
I promise you I will never make you
feel like I'm too busy for you ever again.

1336
01:13:59,541 --> 01:14:02,708
And I promise I will never hover
like a helicopter again.

1337
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:03,875
Wait, what?

1338
01:14:03,958 --> 01:14:05,083
- It doesn't matter.
- Okay.

1339
01:14:08,083 --> 01:14:09,208
Margaret...

1340
01:14:09,291 --> 01:14:10,208
[grunts]

1341
01:14:11,291 --> 01:14:14,000
[clears throat] I'm so terribly sorry
to interrupt, Your Graces,

1342
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:16,166
but Fiona is headed to the cathedral.

1343
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:17,416
Right, let's go.

1344
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:26,541
- [organ music playing]
- [voices murmuring]

1345
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:28,583
[archbishop] This is highly irregular.

1346
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:32,500
The coronation is scheduled
for tomorrow on Christmas Day.

1347
01:14:32,583 --> 01:14:35,500
But I'm going to be
at St. Michael's on Christmas Day.

1348
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:37,875
I've promised the orphans.

1349
01:14:37,958 --> 01:14:40,000
I thought the orphans
were at St. Matthew's.

1350
01:14:41,333 --> 01:14:44,166
It's a world tour of orphans.

1351
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:46,500
[Antonio] It may be an unusual request,
Your Excellency,

1352
01:14:46,583 --> 01:14:48,708
but there's nothing
in canon or civil law

1353
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:52,791
that prevents an heir apparent
from selecting the date of the coronation.

1354
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:54,208
- [door opens]
- I know the law, sir,

1355
01:14:54,291 --> 01:14:57,458
and it clearly states that
a representative of the civil government

1356
01:14:57,541 --> 01:14:59,833
must be in attendance
when a new monarch is crowned.

1357
01:14:59,916 --> 01:15:02,041
I spoke to the Prime Minister an hour ago.

1358
01:15:02,708 --> 01:15:04,291
And here she is now.

1359
01:15:08,458 --> 01:15:09,583
I see.

1360
01:15:10,458 --> 01:15:12,250
We'll need some time to prepare.

1361
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:26,833
Wait a second,
wasn't that the turnoff for the airport?

1362
01:15:26,916 --> 01:15:31,416
It was, but the bridge got washed away
six months ago.

1363
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:32,750
Terrible flood.

1364
01:15:32,833 --> 01:15:34,833
A flood? In June?

1365
01:15:34,916 --> 01:15:37,416
Summer storms can be so unpredictable.

1366
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,833
- As long as we don't miss our flight, man.
- We wouldn't want that.

1367
01:15:42,958 --> 01:15:45,208
Is Your Majesty willing and able

1368
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:48,791
to take this sacred oath
to uphold the laws and customs

1369
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:51,125
of the Sovereign Nation of Montenaro?

1370
01:15:51,208 --> 01:15:52,500
Yes, I am.

1371
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:55,500
Willing and able.

1372
01:15:56,041 --> 01:15:57,791
Then repeat after me.

1373
01:15:58,541 --> 01:16:01,375
I, Margaret Katherine Claire Delacourt…

1374
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:04,041
I, Margaret Clara Karen...

1375
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:06,166
Margaret Katherine Claire.

1376
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:09,208
I, Margaret Katherine Claire…

1377
01:16:10,083 --> 01:16:12,375
- Dela...
- Delacourt, right.

1378
01:16:13,708 --> 01:16:16,500
I, Margaret Katherine Claire Delacourt...

1379
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:19,875
I command you to stop
these proceedings at once.

1380
01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:25,000
Oh, dear Lord. There are three of them.

1381
01:16:25,083 --> 01:16:26,666
No, Your Eminence.

1382
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:29,541
There is only one Margaret Delacourt
and I am she.

1383
01:16:30,125 --> 01:16:33,125
The woman you were about to crown
as your queen is an impostor.

1384
01:16:34,166 --> 01:16:35,666
Antonio, tell them.

1385
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:39,875
Guards,
arrest this woman at once for treason.

1386
01:16:39,958 --> 01:16:41,000
Antonio, it's me.

1387
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,666
Don't you dare!

1388
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:45,041
And you are?

1389
01:16:45,125 --> 01:16:49,041
I'm Princess Stacy Juliette
De Novo Wyndham of Belgravia.

1390
01:16:49,666 --> 01:16:52,250
Fiona kidnapped me
thinking I was Margaret,

1391
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:55,208
but I wasn't Margaret
because Margaret and I switched places.

1392
01:16:55,291 --> 01:16:56,958
I'm very confused.

1393
01:16:57,041 --> 01:16:59,625
I understand exactly how you feel,
Your Eminence,

1394
01:17:00,208 --> 01:17:02,000
but it seems the woman
you're about to crown

1395
01:17:02,083 --> 01:17:04,375
is actually Lady Margaret's cousin.

1396
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:06,583
Is this true?

1397
01:17:08,208 --> 01:17:09,958
Fiona, it's over.

1398
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:14,166
- Reggie and Mindy are in police custody.
- They confessed to everything.

1399
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:15,166
[sighs]

1400
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:17,916
Oh, all right, it's me,

1401
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:22,458
but I didn't want to go through with it.
That freak Antonio made me do it.

1402
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,750
[chuckles]

1403
01:17:24,833 --> 01:17:26,916
Margaret, she's lying.

1404
01:17:27,416 --> 01:17:29,666
You were ready to throw me in prison.

1405
01:17:31,041 --> 01:17:32,916
Look, if you'll only just listen to me...

1406
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,250
I've listened long enough.

1407
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,875
You almost had me convinced
that I wasn't ready to rule on my own,

1408
01:17:39,625 --> 01:17:43,458
but the fact is I've never been
more ready for anything in my life.

1409
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:45,791
I love Montenaro.

1410
01:17:45,875 --> 01:17:49,125
I love its people and I've learned
everything I can about them

1411
01:17:49,208 --> 01:17:52,708
for the past six months, so I can
serve them to the best of my ability.

1412
01:17:53,333 --> 01:17:54,916
You don't know how to command.

1413
01:17:56,333 --> 01:17:57,291
Watch this.

1414
01:17:57,375 --> 01:18:01,166
Arrest him and take him to the dungeon.

1415
01:18:07,458 --> 01:18:08,833
I bet that felt good.

1416
01:18:09,583 --> 01:18:10,958
You have no idea.

1417
01:18:11,041 --> 01:18:11,958
[door opens]

1418
01:18:13,291 --> 01:18:14,333
[door closes]

1419
01:18:14,416 --> 01:18:16,833
One tiny teeny little question.

1420
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:21,750
Since I technically didn't kidnap you,
am I really guilty?

1421
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:23,791
- Yes.
- Yes.

1422
01:18:23,875 --> 01:18:27,708
But, Maggie Moo,
it's Christmas and I'm your cuzzy.

1423
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:30,375
Are you kidding? You committed treason!

1424
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:32,166
Well, I didn't mean to.

1425
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,000
[scoffs]

1426
01:18:34,083 --> 01:18:36,375
You know, it's always been hard for me,

1427
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:38,791
growing up with parents who despised me.

1428
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:41,250
They didn't despise you.

1429
01:18:43,625 --> 01:18:46,666
The truth is
I've always wanted to be you.

1430
01:18:47,291 --> 01:18:49,125
I just got carried away this time.

1431
01:18:50,333 --> 01:18:52,833
But I could never be half of what you are.

1432
01:18:54,208 --> 01:18:58,916
You were born to be queen, even
though you didn't realize until now.

1433
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:01,958
I owe you an apology, Moo.

1434
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:04,833
I behaved abominably. I'm sorry.

1435
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:08,416
You're the only real family I've ever had.

1436
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:11,458
The only one who truly cares.

1437
01:19:11,541 --> 01:19:14,166
Poor, poor girl.

1438
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:16,708
- Oh, please.
- [Frank] What?

1439
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,416
I suppose I could ask the judge
for a reduced sentence.

1440
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:22,750
[Stacy] Are you sure about that?

1441
01:19:23,333 --> 01:19:27,083
Along with supervised community
service for many, many years.

1442
01:19:27,166 --> 01:19:28,750
[archbishop] I hate to interrupt,

1443
01:19:28,833 --> 01:19:31,583
but are we proceeding
with the coronation?

1444
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:35,291
The coronation will proceed
on Christmas Day as scheduled.

1445
01:19:35,875 --> 01:19:39,625
Now if you all will excuse me,
I really must call Kevin.

1446
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:41,625
We were supposed to have dinner hours ago.

1447
01:19:41,708 --> 01:19:43,125
[Fiona] About Kevin…

1448
01:19:43,208 --> 01:19:44,666
What about Kevin?

1449
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:47,541
He would have found me out,
so I had to send him packing.

1450
01:19:47,625 --> 01:19:48,625
[Edward] Oh, dear.

1451
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:50,291
Dear…
- [text keys clicking]

1452
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,083
No, he's not answering.

1453
01:19:54,166 --> 01:19:57,916
I'm guessing he's on his way
to the airport with that small person.

1454
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,291
His daughter?

1455
01:19:59,375 --> 01:20:00,916
He mentioned an Octavia.

1456
01:20:01,583 --> 01:20:02,958
You mean Olivia?

1457
01:20:03,041 --> 01:20:04,583
That's what I said.

1458
01:20:05,625 --> 01:20:06,583
Frank, get the car.

1459
01:20:06,666 --> 01:20:07,958
At the double, sir.

1460
01:20:27,541 --> 01:20:28,750
Keep the change, man.

1461
01:20:28,833 --> 01:20:30,083
Don't worry, sir.

1462
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:34,083
Everything's gonna be all right.
I guarantee it.

1463
01:20:34,833 --> 01:20:36,583
Yeah. Thanks.

1464
01:20:40,833 --> 01:20:41,750
[car door shuts]

1465
01:20:53,458 --> 01:20:57,000
It can't be. No. It can't. It can't.

1466
01:20:57,083 --> 01:21:01,875
[man on PA] <i>This is the final boarding</i>
<i>call for Monten-air flight 201 to Chicago.</i>

1467
01:21:01,958 --> 01:21:03,833
That's us. Come on. Excuse me, sorry.

1468
01:21:09,916 --> 01:21:11,416
[Edward] Wait here, Frank.

1469
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,125
Right, let's go. Right.

1470
01:21:25,833 --> 01:21:27,333
Looks like we made it on time.

1471
01:21:27,416 --> 01:21:28,333
[Olivia] Mm-hmm.

1472
01:21:29,875 --> 01:21:30,708
[Margaret] Kevin!

1473
01:21:33,375 --> 01:21:34,208
Kevin.

1474
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:36,541
Come on.

1475
01:21:37,375 --> 01:21:38,333
Kevin!

1476
01:21:39,791 --> 01:21:43,583
Kevin, please don't leave.
I can explain everything.

1477
01:21:44,958 --> 01:21:47,750
You look like Stacy
but you sound like Margaret.

1478
01:21:47,833 --> 01:21:49,541
Well, because I am Margaret.

1479
01:21:50,041 --> 01:21:51,375
We never switched back.

1480
01:21:51,458 --> 01:21:52,291
Oh.

1481
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:54,916
Why are you dressed like that?

1482
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,291
Fiona kidnapped me
and took Margaret's place.

1483
01:21:57,791 --> 01:21:58,625
Right…

1484
01:21:58,708 --> 01:22:00,166
Don't you get it?

1485
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:04,375
It wasn't Margaret who told you to leave.
It was Fiona.

1486
01:22:04,458 --> 01:22:05,541
[Kevin] Is that true?

1487
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:08,125
Nothing has ever been more true.

1488
01:22:10,083 --> 01:22:12,458
I can't imagine my life without you.

1489
01:22:13,041 --> 01:22:14,833
I can't imagine my life without you.

1490
01:22:15,541 --> 01:22:18,041
Well, then…

1491
01:22:19,458 --> 01:22:20,583
Marry me?

1492
01:22:21,416 --> 01:22:23,666
That's what I was gonna ask you
last summer.

1493
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:25,125
- [Edward gasps, chuckles]
- Wait.

1494
01:22:25,625 --> 01:22:26,458
[laughs]

1495
01:22:27,875 --> 01:22:29,750
Would someone say yes, please?

1496
01:22:29,833 --> 01:22:31,083
[chuckles]

1497
01:22:31,166 --> 01:22:32,083
- Yes.
- Yes.

1498
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:47,208
Thank you.

1499
01:22:47,291 --> 01:22:50,541
Why don't we make this official right now?

1500
01:22:51,041 --> 01:22:52,916
[laughing]

1501
01:22:53,625 --> 01:22:55,125
Oh, that's what I love about you.

1502
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,250
Be right back.

1503
01:23:00,125 --> 01:23:02,208
[clears throat] Excuse me.

1504
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:05,666
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother,
we'd like to be married.

1505
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:08,125
What, here, now?

1506
01:23:09,458 --> 01:23:10,375
Aren't you…

1507
01:23:10,458 --> 01:23:12,625
Margaret Delacourt, the future queen. Yes.

1508
01:23:13,416 --> 01:23:14,916
This is my fiancé, Kevin.

1509
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,916
Well, my flight boards in five minutes.

1510
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,916
I'm sure they'll hold your flight
for a royal wedding.

1511
01:23:21,458 --> 01:23:23,125
An abridged version would be fine.

1512
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:26,375
- I wouldn't want to impose.
- Are you sure about this?

1513
01:23:26,458 --> 01:23:28,416
Real sure. Come on.

1514
01:23:29,125 --> 01:23:30,375
All right.

1515
01:23:30,458 --> 01:23:31,541
[priest clears throat]

1516
01:23:35,083 --> 01:23:35,916
Perfect.

01:23:37,041 --> 01:23:40,125

Have you prepared your vows?

1523
01:23:55,083 --> 01:23:56,416
I think we can wing it.

1524
01:24:00,375 --> 01:24:03,875
I promise to walk by your side forever…

1525
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:08,291
To love and support you
in everything that you do.

Dearest Kevin,
I wish I could promise you the world,

1532
01:24:36,875 --> 01:24:38,583
but the world is not mine to give.

1533
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:41,625
What I can promise you

1534
01:24:41,708 --> 01:24:42,750
is my world

1535
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:45,875
