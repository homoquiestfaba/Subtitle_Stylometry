I got 357 reloads. They're lead.

Ahhh. Dum-dums.

83
00:10:21,995 --> 00:10:23,631
You want split heads
or mercuries?

84
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,968
I'll split 'em myself.

More.

[Harry] Can I get
some attention, please?

95
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:57,901
I've got a drop off.

96
00:10:59,203 --> 00:11:00,338
We're full up.

97
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,576
Now, you make room for this one.

98
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:05,215
Why? We haven't been
booking whores for years.

99

-[Reno] I'm no whore.
-Oh, yeah?

100
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:10,225
[chuckles] Too bad.
I'd pay for a slice.

101
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:15,135
Look, just log her in.
I'll be back for my credits.

102
00:11:15,168 --> 00:11:16,738

Restrain extreme prejudice.
Red Star...

106
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,067
What's the matter?
Lose your appetite?

107
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:38,047
Oh, please, Mr. Gary,
just one more week?

108
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:41,354
I know. I'll leave and throw in
a midnight show for free.

109
00:11:41,387 --> 00:11:42,724
All new material.

110
00:11:42,924 --> 00:11:44,693
Dickie, you know I think
you're the best,

111
00:11:44,728 --> 00:11:45,930
I'd do anything for you.

112
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:48,936
Except give him a week.

113
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,877
I can't even give you
another day.

114
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,814
Too many people know
what you've been selling

115
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,852
out of that little suitcase
of yours, Dickie.

116
00:11:57,085 --> 00:11:58,789
It's bad for my business.

117
00:11:59,056 --> 00:12:00,225
Somebody has to do it.

118
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,131
I help people.
They need me.

119
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,770
Selling death ain't funny,
Dickie.

120
00:12:06,103 --> 00:12:07,305
Look, I wish you the best

121
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:09,443
and I hope the audition
in Neon City pays off.

122
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:10,913
Hell, look at the bright side,

123
00:12:10,946 --> 00:12:12,716
the air's gotta be better
up there.

124
00:12:12,984 --> 00:12:14,954
Say, what's the weather forecast
for tomorrow?

125
00:12:15,121 --> 00:12:16,758
I know you're gonna tell me.

126
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:18,929
Cloudy with a slight chance of

127
00:12:18,962 --> 00:12:20,432
-acid--
-Acid rain!

128
00:12:21,434 --> 00:12:25,475
-Dickie, good luck, pal.
-I'll need it. [chuckles]

129
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:27,780
Oh, God!

[coughing]

133
00:12:53,498 --> 00:12:55,502
[Tom] You could try
the black market for food.

134
00:12:57,539 --> 00:12:59,276
[man] Are you the black market?

135
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,419
-Not exactly.
-[grunting]

136
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:14,273
Such a nasty cough.
Isn't that better?

137
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:24,894
[Tom groaning]

138
00:13:29,336 --> 00:13:30,906
[panting]

139
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,054
[doctor] That's the last time,
Tom.

140
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,562
Yeah.

141
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:44,600
Sure, until you need
some more cash.

142
00:13:45,068 --> 00:13:46,470
Find yourself another source.

143
00:13:48,074 --> 00:13:51,480
[gasping] Why would I do that?
Your stuff is the best.

144
00:13:53,217 --> 00:13:54,353
I'm through with this.

145
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:57,960
Oh, Christ!
You got a booming business here.

146
00:13:58,227 --> 00:14:02,068
You got people crawling in here
with all kinds of diseases.

147
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:03,237
Cancers!

148
00:14:04,741 --> 00:14:05,943
Hell...

149
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,249
the world going to crap

150
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:10,986
is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

151
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:19,703
Quit it, Tom.

152
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:23,577
If you don't leave me alone,
I'll turn you in if I have to.

153
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:40,111
Maybe.

154
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:42,783
Maybe not.

155
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:45,121
[scoffs]

156
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:56,210
You ever heard of a prosecutor
named Jenkins?

157
00:14:56,443 --> 00:14:57,512
Who the hell hasn't?

158
00:14:57,847 --> 00:14:59,549
He took both my sisters' kids.

159
00:15:00,184 --> 00:15:02,155
Of course now
it's Captain Jenkins.

160
00:15:02,322 --> 00:15:03,324
Captain of what?

161
00:15:03,524 --> 00:15:04,526
Rangers.

162
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:07,332
He left genetic prosecutions
about a year ago.

163
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,538
They made him head honcho
over in Neon City.

164
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,577
Hmm. Captain Jenkins.

165
00:15:13,845 --> 00:15:15,081
What's he to you?

166
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:18,722
He served papers on my family.
I'm gonna kill him.

167
00:15:20,324 --> 00:15:21,427
[gun cocks]

168
00:15:22,595 --> 00:15:24,232
Step away from the bar,
tough guy.

169
00:15:30,344 --> 00:15:32,348
I heard you were a freelancer
in the outlands.

170
00:15:32,883 --> 00:15:33,885
I was.

171
00:15:34,386 --> 00:15:35,889
I heard you even went back east.

172
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,392
I did.

173
00:15:39,196 --> 00:15:40,565
Did you bring me back anything?

174
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,235
Have you been a good boy?

175
00:15:44,473 --> 00:15:46,310
Stark, you're an ungrateful
son of a bitch.

176
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,815
But a sight for sad eyes,
all the same.

177
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,184
[chuckling]

178
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:52,589
-It's good to see you.
-Good to see you.

179
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,194
-Let me buy you a drink.
-Absolutely.

180
00:15:56,463 --> 00:15:57,766
It's been too long.

181
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:00,839
Tell me you got nothing better
to do than to, uh,

182
00:16:00,873 --> 00:16:02,242
piss my people off?

183
00:16:02,943 --> 00:16:05,715
-It's not hard to do.
-You noticed that.

184
00:16:07,786 --> 00:16:08,788
[man] Stark.

185
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:10,926
You got lucky at Annie's.

186
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:13,531
[Harry] Sorry, I missed you.

187
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,670
You boys wanna be sure
to be out of here by dark.

188
00:16:16,971 --> 00:16:19,376
-Now go on, move on.
-Whatever you say, captain.

189
00:16:19,977 --> 00:16:21,814
We'll see you on the outlands,
Stark.

190
00:16:24,352 --> 00:16:26,657
That Red Star you brought in,
that's a nice piece of work.

191
00:16:26,858 --> 00:16:28,594
-[Harry] Yeah.
-Torched her own home.

192
00:16:28,895 --> 00:16:30,665
Murdered her own parents.

193
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:32,302
-No kidding.
-Yeah.

194
00:16:32,535 --> 00:16:33,972
But she's out
of my jurisdiction.

195
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:36,643
That's bullshit,
her warrant's universal.

196
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:38,815
Yeah, but the booking's out
of the northern districts.

197
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,819
They gotta run her
through the courts up there.

198
00:16:41,386 --> 00:16:42,655
It's not my problem.

199
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,559
It is if you want your credits.

200
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,334
What are you up to, Raymond?

201
00:16:48,768 --> 00:16:51,306
-Harry.
-Where's she gotta go?

202
00:16:51,707 --> 00:16:52,776
Neon City.

203
00:16:53,878 --> 00:16:56,316
There's a transport leaving
for Neon this morning.

204
00:16:56,985 --> 00:16:58,989
I've got an escort
waiting for it at Astro Station,

205
00:16:59,022 --> 00:17:00,658
but he got nobody
to ride shotgun

206
00:17:00,691 --> 00:17:01,693
till he gets there.

207
00:17:02,863 --> 00:17:04,466
Job's yours, Harry,
if you want it.

208
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:06,771
I'll make my own delivery.

209
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:11,948
Look, Harry, I, uh, I've got
this VIP passenger on board,

210
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:14,787
she's a daughter
of this rich prick in Neon City.

211
00:17:15,688 --> 00:17:17,692
Hell, I'd take her myself
but I can't leave,

212
00:17:17,726 --> 00:17:19,562
you've seen the kind of help
I've got here.

213
00:17:20,464 --> 00:17:21,600
You'll figure something,
Raymond.

214
00:17:21,868 --> 00:17:22,870
You're the law.

215
00:17:26,443 --> 00:17:27,512
You were a good ranger.

216
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,750
-I'm asking for some help.
-Don't.

217
00:17:30,618 --> 00:17:32,488
Harry, if we're ever gonna
get things turning...

218
00:17:33,157 --> 00:17:34,827
respect for the law
comes first.

219
00:17:35,194 --> 00:17:36,764
-We can't just--
-No, Raymond!

220
00:17:36,998 --> 00:17:38,768
Life and liberty come first.

221
00:17:39,602 --> 00:17:41,640
That's what your laws
are supposed to guarantee.

222
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,914
I did everything I could,
Harry.

223
00:17:46,818 --> 00:17:47,953
You did jack shit.

224
00:17:48,587 --> 00:17:50,926
The whole department sat around
with its thumb up its ass

225
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,462
while Jenkins was given
a free hand

226
00:17:52,495 --> 00:17:53,732
to walk all over my life.

227
00:17:54,165 --> 00:17:55,401
It had to be done.

228
00:17:55,836 --> 00:17:58,140
-Don't say that.
-It's the law, Harry.

229
00:18:00,912 --> 00:18:03,050
-He was my son.
-He was mutant.

230
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:04,652
[grunts]

231
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:18,013
Fuck you and the law.

232
00:18:21,888 --> 00:18:23,792
[indistinct chatter]

233
00:18:33,677 --> 00:18:34,814
-How are you doing?
-All right.

234
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,620
Haven't seen you on the Neon run
in a long time, Bulk.

235
00:18:38,654 --> 00:18:40,959
Yeah, I kinda lost my seniority
and I took a little vacation.

236
00:18:41,693 --> 00:18:42,763
These windows up or down?

237
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,566
Down, man.
The fumes will kill you.

238
00:18:46,804 --> 00:18:47,840
Dickie Devine?

239
00:18:48,574 --> 00:18:50,044
Yeah, we're finally getting rid
of him.

240
00:18:50,846 --> 00:18:52,048
He tries his act in my coach,

241
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:53,584
I'll leave his ass
in the Xander.

242
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:56,323
You better load yourself up, uh,

243
00:18:56,356 --> 00:18:57,993
Skins are making
some hits lately.

244
00:18:58,728 --> 00:19:00,064
Mostly east, but, uh,

245
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,734
you don't wanna
take any chances.

246
00:19:03,237 --> 00:19:04,239
This all the ammo?

247
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,742
It's the best I can do.

248
00:19:06,142 --> 00:19:07,578
Might as well leave the guns.

249
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,848
What's the weather report?

250
00:19:09,984 --> 00:19:11,686
Couple of Xander clouds,
and one of our people in Astro

251
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,994
claims he saw a bright but, uh,
no confirmation.

252
00:19:15,628 --> 00:19:17,733
-Spend the night in Astro?
-Mm-hmm.

253
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:19,837
That's good
because my sister is there

254
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,139
and I haven't seen her
in five years.

255
00:19:21,172 --> 00:19:22,743
Yeah,
just set it down right here.

256
00:19:25,714 --> 00:19:26,716
Yeah.

257
00:19:26,951 --> 00:19:28,755
Blastin' some new whales
in Neon.

258
00:19:28,988 --> 00:19:30,892
You're gonna be carrying
some pretty heavy shit.

259
00:19:31,393 --> 00:19:32,662
It's perfectly safe...

260
00:19:33,196 --> 00:19:34,967
takes a lot of heat
for it to go.

261
00:19:36,303 --> 00:19:38,106
Bonus. Hundred new credits.

262
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:40,879
-That I like.
-[chuckles]

263
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:45,020
[announcer]
All Skins
are restricted...

264
00:19:45,321 --> 00:19:46,556
-Sign it.
-Gladly.

265
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,064
Why can't I go in the transport?
Why do I have to ride with him?

266
00:19:50,865 --> 00:19:51,867
You got lucky.

267
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,779
So, it looks like we're stuck
with each other, huh?

268
00:19:58,213 --> 00:19:59,649
And don't bring her back.

269
00:20:02,355 --> 00:20:03,925
Killed your mum and dad, eh?

270
00:20:05,795 --> 00:20:07,031
Nice move.

271
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:10,905
Let's go, man. We got hot stuff,

272
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:12,809
we gotta pack it in there nice
and tight.

273
00:20:12,943 --> 00:20:14,112
Don't want anything
moving around.

274
00:20:14,145 --> 00:20:15,147
Let's go, move it!

275
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,318
All right, men, tie it down.
Let's go!

276
00:20:17,351 --> 00:20:18,687
We gotta get out of here!

277
00:20:18,888 --> 00:20:20,057
Now!

278
00:20:22,796 --> 00:20:25,234
Careful with those.
They're very expensive.

279
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,937
They need to be loaded
in the front.

280
00:20:26,971 --> 00:20:27,973
[man] You got it, lady.

281
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:31,212
Excuse me.

282
00:20:32,248 --> 00:20:35,120
-This is the Neon transport?
-Yeah.

283
00:20:35,454 --> 00:20:36,957
It's even nicer on the inside.

284
00:20:41,934 --> 00:20:44,238
[Twink] Please be careful,
especially with that one.

285
00:20:44,505 --> 00:20:47,378
[announcer]
Neon City.
Neon City now boarding.

286
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,182
You want me to load
that bag for you?

287
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,821
[announcer]
Neon City
now boarding.

288
00:20:52,088 --> 00:20:55,494
If you don't mind,
I'd like to hold on to it.

289
00:20:56,096 --> 00:20:57,231
Well, suit yourself.

290
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,502
Diesel powered?

291
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,843
It's turbo jet assisted.
Baby's got a lot of torque.

292
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:05,547
[Dickie] Bulk! [chuckles]
Been dieting?

293
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,957
Looks like you've down to...
medium-gross [chuckles]

294
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:12,863
You know,
I'm really gonna enjoy

295
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,398
riding shotgun with you.

296
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:17,238
Oh, sorry, Dickie. He's kinda
twisting my arm behind my back,

297
00:21:17,271 --> 00:21:19,075
so he's gonna ride
up front with me on this trip.

298
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:20,611
-Oh.
-Why don't you, uh,

299
00:21:20,644 --> 00:21:23,416
get yourself a nice seat
in the back? [chuckles]

300
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,857
All right, load 'em up!

301
00:21:34,572 --> 00:21:35,574
Just got a call.

302
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:39,348
Got a doctor on the way out
and another woman.

303
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:42,288
Well, we can always use
a doctor.

304
00:21:43,557 --> 00:21:44,592
Woman got a name?

305
00:21:45,327 --> 00:21:48,200
Oh, yeah.
Sandy from the Lonestar.

306
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,905
I heard she could show you
a real good time,

307
00:21:50,939 --> 00:21:52,308
if you can afford her.

308
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:53,643
Excuse me.

309
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,583
I've got a town to get out of.

310
00:22:00,557 --> 00:22:03,296
My God, Bulk!

311
00:22:03,731 --> 00:22:05,067
Look at you.

312
00:22:06,202 --> 00:22:08,573
-I thought you were...
-Sandy, it's great to see you.

313
00:22:10,177 --> 00:22:11,179
You look good.

314
00:22:12,014 --> 00:22:14,085
-Let me help you with this.
-Thanks.

315
00:22:14,753 --> 00:22:15,955
[man grunts]

316
00:22:22,234 --> 00:22:23,370
Thank you, sir.

317
00:22:27,244 --> 00:22:28,246
[man grunts]

318
00:22:33,523 --> 00:22:36,496
[man] No, no, no, no.
Tie it up on the other side

319
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:37,665
and tie it down good.

320
00:22:40,103 --> 00:22:41,105
[Bulk] Harry.

321
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:43,243
When did you get out?

322
00:22:44,378 --> 00:22:45,380
A month ago.

323
00:22:47,752 --> 00:22:49,088
You two are gonna have
a problem?

324
00:22:49,422 --> 00:22:50,557
[chuckles] Not me, captain.

325
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:53,530
What's five years
between old buddies.

326
00:22:54,131 --> 00:22:55,267
He was just doing his job.

327
00:22:55,802 --> 00:22:57,004
Weren't you, Harry?

328
00:23:00,143 --> 00:23:01,145
Who's your old buddy?

329
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,416
-We used to be friends.
-Yeah? What did he do?

330
00:23:04,618 --> 00:23:06,422
Five years for beating a man
to death in a street brawl.

331
00:23:06,456 --> 00:23:08,093
-Did you bust him?
-That's right.

332
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:09,428
-Your old buddy?
-Yeah.

333
00:23:09,695 --> 00:23:10,798
Nice move, asshole.

334
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,705
Who the hell do you think...

335
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,309
[explosion]

336
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:19,281
[crowd screaming]

337
00:23:22,822 --> 00:23:23,791
Raymond.

338
00:23:24,726 --> 00:23:26,329
All right, everyone. Calm down,
calm down.

339
00:23:26,362 --> 00:23:28,133
Just some Skins raising hell.

340
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,274
You did that, didn't you, huh?

341
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:34,278
You son of a bitch.

342
00:23:34,445 --> 00:23:35,480
[grunts]

343
00:23:43,163 --> 00:23:44,598
-Nice job.
-Thanks, captain.

344
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:49,141
Get him in the transport.

345
00:23:49,943 --> 00:23:51,412
Cuff that one to him.

346
00:24:00,965 --> 00:24:01,900
[man] Put it out.

347
00:24:02,668 --> 00:24:04,238
[indistinct chatter]

348
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:10,350
Good.

349
00:24:11,753 --> 00:24:13,456
If he keeps working
in the outlands much longer,

350
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,293
he'd be dead
or no better than a Skin.

351
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:19,368
He know you're here?

352
00:24:20,872 --> 00:24:23,777
[Sandy] He looks different.
Worse than I remember.

353
00:24:24,645 --> 00:24:25,647
He is.

354
00:24:26,516 --> 00:24:27,785
Don't do this, Raymond.

355
00:24:28,787 --> 00:24:31,225
It isn't fair.
I got a whole new life

356
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:32,461
waiting for me in Neon.

357
00:24:32,795 --> 00:24:34,532
I need the extra firepower
on board.

358
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,669
I'm sorry, Sandy,
it's luck of the draw.

359
00:24:37,004 --> 00:24:38,640
Yeah, well, it stinks.

360
00:24:39,508 --> 00:24:41,379
[indistinct chatter]

361
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:46,890
-Keep an eye on him.
-Do I have a choice?

362
00:24:47,658 --> 00:24:48,660
Nope.

363
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,666
Hey, Neon! Wait!

364
00:24:53,036 --> 00:24:54,405
[Bulk] Almost didn't make it,
doc.

365
00:24:56,342 --> 00:24:58,379
Tom. Call me Dr. Tom.

366
00:25:05,728 --> 00:25:08,032
[Dickie] Oh, no, no, no.
I'll be fine right here.

367
00:25:09,568 --> 00:25:10,704
-[Tom] Hello.
-Hi.

368
00:25:23,864 --> 00:25:25,700
Excuse me,
I didn't see anybody there.

369
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:30,410
What's your problem, lady?

370
00:25:30,811 --> 00:25:31,712
You're handcuffed.

371
00:25:32,982 --> 00:25:34,051
[Raymond] Step inside, Mr. Wing.

372
00:25:35,153 --> 00:25:36,255
All right, folks, can I have
your attention, please?

373
00:25:37,591 --> 00:25:40,664
We just, uh, made contact
with Satellite Monarch Three

374
00:25:40,697 --> 00:25:43,036
a few minutes ago,
and, uh, it seems they picked up

375
00:25:43,069 --> 00:25:45,640
a large group of Skins
coming down from the north.

376
00:25:46,008 --> 00:25:48,613
Now, there's an armed escort
meeting you at Astro Station.

377
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:53,356
And with Bulk here, and, uh...
Stark on board,

378
00:25:53,757 --> 00:25:55,694
you're more than well-equipped
to handle any problems

379
00:25:55,728 --> 00:25:57,030
you might encounter
along the way.

380
00:25:57,631 --> 00:25:59,836
But if any of you should decide
to stay behind now,

381
00:25:59,869 --> 00:26:01,472
I should warn you,

382
00:26:01,505 --> 00:26:03,609
this could be the last transport
for some time.

383
00:26:03,777 --> 00:26:05,881
[indistinct chatter]

384
00:26:05,915 --> 00:26:07,517
Hold on, hold on a minute.

385
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,388
We're going through
no matter what.

386
00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:11,459
Anybody wants to stay,
the company will be glad

387
00:26:11,492 --> 00:26:12,494
to give you a refund.

388
00:26:13,162 --> 00:26:15,033
-I'll stay.
-[Raymond] Like, hell.

389
00:26:15,735 --> 00:26:16,737
[Dickie] Oh, um...

390
00:26:17,104 --> 00:26:18,606
maybe I should, uh...

391
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:23,516
I've gotta make my audition.

392
00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:25,921
Surely the government
can guarantee the safety

393
00:26:25,955 --> 00:26:28,659
-of the highways, captain.
-Where you been, lady?

394
00:26:28,961 --> 00:26:30,965
Actually, I've been
in Switzerland

395
00:26:31,165 --> 00:26:34,171
for the past few years.
It can't be that bad.

396
00:26:37,177 --> 00:26:37,979
Sandy?

397
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:40,717
There's someone waiting for me
in Neon.

398
00:26:43,556 --> 00:26:44,691
Duty calls, I'm afraid.

399
00:26:45,193 --> 00:26:46,662
They need me in Neon City.

400
00:26:50,136 --> 00:26:51,138
I'll go.

401
00:26:53,543 --> 00:26:55,513
Well, then I, uh,
guess that's about it.

402
00:26:55,713 --> 00:26:57,885
Captain,
my father is holding you

403
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,856
personally responsible
for my safety.

404
00:27:00,156 --> 00:27:01,692
Yes, ma'am. Ms. Talaman. I know.

405
00:27:02,661 --> 00:27:03,730
Well, then I guess that's it.

406
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,101
I'm sure you folks will have
a nice, safe journey.

407
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:07,972
Bye.

408
00:27:56,937 --> 00:27:58,272
All right, folks,
my name is Bulk.

409
00:27:58,306 --> 00:27:59,141
I'm here to welcome you

410
00:27:59,174 --> 00:28:01,178
to Overlands Transport
Neon City run.

411
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,915
How are you all doing
back there?

412
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:05,320
The toilet's in the middle
of the coach.

413
00:28:05,921 --> 00:28:06,923
Don't drink the water.

414
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:10,096
Drinking the water is okay
from either tank at the rear.

415
00:28:10,831 --> 00:28:11,900
And don't drink the water

416
00:28:11,933 --> 00:28:13,202
if the filter
is below the red line.

417
00:28:13,469 --> 00:28:14,772
You all know what will happen.

418
00:28:15,874 --> 00:28:17,410
We don't want anybody getting
the runs. [chuckles]

419
00:28:18,312 --> 00:28:20,083
We'll travel
for about four hours

420
00:28:20,918 --> 00:28:22,654
be at the Astro Station by five.

421
00:28:23,055 --> 00:28:24,391
That's where we'll spend
the night.

422
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:26,796
If you need any help,
just give me a holler.

423
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,898
Enjoy your trip.

424
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:38,185
Oh.

425
00:28:38,452 --> 00:28:39,756
Oh, my.

426
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:41,091
A book!

427
00:28:47,103 --> 00:28:49,107
I've been saving this one
for years.

428
00:28:50,243 --> 00:28:52,013
It's the only one of hers
I've never read.

429
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,087
So you say you have a job
in Neon City, Mr. Devine?

430
00:29:12,855 --> 00:29:13,957
Yes. [chuckles]

431
00:29:15,226 --> 00:29:17,497
Well, practically. I've played
nearly everywhere in the States.

432
00:29:18,265 --> 00:29:20,136
Well, everywhere you can,
I mean.

433
00:29:21,238 --> 00:29:22,908
Well, you know what they say,

434
00:29:23,109 --> 00:29:25,881
as long as we can keep
our sense of humor. [chuckles]

435
00:29:26,148 --> 00:29:28,052
Things can get worse
than they are now.

436
00:29:28,552 --> 00:29:29,554
There's your joke.

437
00:29:30,123 --> 00:29:31,525
Things could be a lot worse.

438
00:29:32,026 --> 00:29:33,496
Yeah, you could be chained
to this.

439
00:29:34,164 --> 00:29:35,366
[grunts]

440
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:40,143
[gasping]

441
00:29:54,271 --> 00:29:55,273
Give me.

442
00:30:02,153 --> 00:30:03,289
[sighs]

443
00:30:04,591 --> 00:30:06,930
-Get me a drink of water.
-Up yours.

444
00:30:07,463 --> 00:30:08,465
Here.

445
00:30:13,075 --> 00:30:14,077
It's safe.

446
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,348
Yeah, right.

447
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,120
Afraid you might
catch something?

448
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,926
Not this time.

449
00:30:23,028 --> 00:30:26,068
Now I know, I've met you
someplace before, haven't I?

450
00:30:26,568 --> 00:30:29,474
-I'm Dickie Devine.
-Sandy.

451
00:30:30,343 --> 00:30:31,946
Sandy Randall.

452
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,984
[Dickie] Doesn't ring a bell.

453
00:30:34,551 --> 00:30:36,488
-What do you do?
-I'm getting married.

454
00:30:36,756 --> 00:30:40,196
Oh, really?
Well, congratulations.

455
00:30:40,363 --> 00:30:42,066
Oh, thank you.

456
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,072
Say, I've got
some great marriage gags.

457
00:30:45,573 --> 00:30:47,510
Anybody here got
a great marriage?

458
00:30:49,782 --> 00:30:52,453
Well, guess it's about time
for me to hit the head.

459
00:30:52,788 --> 00:30:53,990
[chuckles]

460
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,301
You know, folks,
I've got this strange feeling

461
00:30:59,534 --> 00:31:03,977
that this act is about to go
into the toilet. [chuckles]

462
00:31:07,785 --> 00:31:08,753
Come on,
you've never heard of me?

463
00:31:09,755 --> 00:31:12,093
The killer tomato,
my famous squeeze of death.

464
00:31:12,126 --> 00:31:12,995
[squelches]

465
00:31:18,138 --> 00:31:20,609
[Bulk] My parents taught
music lessons back in Indiana.

466
00:31:21,244 --> 00:31:22,781
Blew the whole area years ago.

467
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:25,019
It's just me and my sister now.

468
00:31:27,657 --> 00:31:28,793
Her name is Beth.

469
00:31:30,129 --> 00:31:32,300
-Not bad, huh?
-Lovely.

470
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:36,041
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
That's enough.

471
00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:37,710
Of course, Beth likes men

472
00:31:37,745 --> 00:31:39,547
who holds up their end
of a conversation.

473
00:31:45,626 --> 00:31:46,661
Mm-hmm.

474
00:31:49,501 --> 00:31:55,546
[speaking in foreign language]

475
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,191
-The doctor did it.
-Huh?

476
00:32:01,726 --> 00:32:03,429
Her book. The doctor did it.

477
00:32:04,865 --> 00:32:06,668
That was a childish thing
to do.

478
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:08,105
Just--
just pretend you didn't hear.

479
00:32:08,705 --> 00:32:10,877
At least it proves
the poor thing can read.

480
00:32:11,344 --> 00:32:12,346
[groans]

481
00:32:13,415 --> 00:32:16,154
[grunts] Ass down.
Pull another stunt like that,

482
00:32:16,188 --> 00:32:17,758
-you can ride in the trailer.
-Fine with me!

483
00:32:18,258 --> 00:32:20,897
Pardon me, but does anybody
feel anything...

484
00:32:22,366 --> 00:32:23,368
unusual?

485
00:32:24,471 --> 00:32:25,473
This is Xander.

486
00:32:25,606 --> 00:32:27,176
[siren blaring]

487
00:32:28,545 --> 00:32:29,380
[Bulk]
All right, folks, we're
about enter a Xander cloud.

488
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:30,851
Now, let's not panic.

489
00:32:30,884 --> 00:32:32,286
We have all
been through it before.

490
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,622
Rebreathers are under your seat.

491
00:32:36,695 --> 00:32:38,565
I-- I've never been
in a Xander cloud.

492
00:32:38,733 --> 00:32:39,768
You're gonna be okay.

493
00:32:41,638 --> 00:32:43,275
Just breathe. Breathe!

494
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:57,403
[Dickie coughing]

495
00:32:59,975 --> 00:33:01,311
[Twink] Oh my God.

496
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,783
Oh my God!

497
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:06,388
Don't worry, if we stop,
take a few deep breaths,

498
00:33:06,421 --> 00:33:07,791
get it over real fast.

499
00:33:17,911 --> 00:33:18,947
[whimpers]

500
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,530
Hold this.

501
00:33:33,108 --> 00:33:35,947
[breathing heavily]

502
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:37,503
[clears throat]

503
00:34:41,644 --> 00:34:43,048
-You okay?
-Yeah.

504
00:34:53,235 --> 00:34:54,437
Thanks, Harry.

505
00:34:56,674 --> 00:34:57,676
Thank God.

506
00:34:58,913 --> 00:35:01,886
But why aren't we turning back?
Why doesn't the driver stop?

507
00:35:02,086 --> 00:35:04,123
All right, take-- take it easy.
You're all right.

508
00:35:04,557 --> 00:35:06,561
It's over. It's all over.

509
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,802
[sighs]

510
00:35:18,953 --> 00:35:20,857
[Bulk]
All right, folks,
rest stop coming up.

511
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:21,826
Chance to stretch your legs.

512
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,896
Maybe some fresh water.

513
00:35:43,803 --> 00:35:44,972
Damn water's gone bad.

514
00:35:45,272 --> 00:35:47,109
Yeah, I got a feeling
about this place.

515
00:35:56,862 --> 00:35:57,964
I got you covered, Harry.

516
00:35:58,833 --> 00:35:59,935
Yeah.

517
00:36:00,402 --> 00:36:01,939
That's what I'm afraid of.

518
00:36:25,419 --> 00:36:26,789
[branches rustle]

519
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,807
Bye-bye bag.

520
00:36:37,309 --> 00:36:39,180
I know. Come on.

521
00:36:41,184 --> 00:36:42,386
Come on.

522
00:36:42,419 --> 00:36:44,925
[Harry] Bulk, I need Devine.
And tell him to bring his case.

523
00:36:45,459 --> 00:36:47,229
[Bulk] Dickie, Stark wants you,
bring your bag.

524
00:36:48,766 --> 00:36:50,035
Come on, Devine, let's go!

525
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:07,369
I need to buy a bag.

526
00:37:08,906 --> 00:37:10,777
Sometimes people
don't understand.

527
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:11,812
Yeah, right.

528
00:37:20,963 --> 00:37:21,965
Here.

529
00:37:28,478 --> 00:37:29,480
There you go.

530
00:37:31,484 --> 00:37:32,486
I'm sorry.

531
00:37:37,496 --> 00:37:38,833
[baby whimpering]

532
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,985
[Tom] Just can't leave them,
perhaps I could--

533
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:07,089
What was in that bag
you gave him?

534
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:08,191
Poison.

535
00:38:08,224 --> 00:38:10,095
That's why they call them
"bye-bye bags."

536
00:38:10,428 --> 00:38:11,464
Mr. "Law and order" over here

537
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,334
just killed himself a family
of three.

538
00:38:20,315 --> 00:38:21,117
He kills people.

539
00:38:21,684 --> 00:38:24,023
And you're what?
Just a salesman, right?

540
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,993
You make money
by selling that stuff?

541
00:38:27,462 --> 00:38:29,166
And you all call me a murderer.

542
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:31,037
Right.

543
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,005
[engine revving]

544
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,449
There's only one thing

545
00:38:37,616 --> 00:38:39,053
that could burn
a body like that.

546
00:38:40,188 --> 00:38:42,025
They got caught outside
in a bright.

547
00:38:43,628 --> 00:38:44,630
A bright?

548
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:47,569
Yeah.

549
00:38:48,571 --> 00:38:50,342
Nobody knows exactly what it is,
it's kinda...

550
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,212
like a rainbow.

551
00:38:53,314 --> 00:38:57,055
[Wing] Think of a giant
magnifying glass in the sky

552
00:38:57,623 --> 00:39:01,932
made out of tiny particles
of water and pollutants.

553
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:05,639
When it diffracts
and magnifies sunlight,

554
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,546
it creates a hotspot, a bright.

555
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:11,217
Hard to tell...

556
00:39:11,752 --> 00:39:14,323
where or when
it's going to happen...

557
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:18,631
and how intense
it's going to be.

558
00:39:26,647 --> 00:39:29,219
Hey, driver. You happen to leave
your old buddy back there!

559
00:39:30,522 --> 00:39:32,626
Out of sight, not out of mind.

560
00:39:38,271 --> 00:39:39,406
Friend's got a sense of humor.

561
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:44,416
Yeah, she's a lot of laughs.
She torched her parents.

562
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,422
Nobody's perfect.

563
00:39:51,832 --> 00:39:53,267
You're a sick man, Bulk.

564
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:56,173
Ain't we all?

565
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:19,319
It's a shame
the bastards let it happen.

566
00:40:19,754 --> 00:40:21,323
[Wing] Hard to place the blame.

567
00:40:21,758 --> 00:40:24,396
Everyone was pouring filth
into the sky.

568
00:40:24,831 --> 00:40:28,404
The ozone was dying
for 100 years.

569
00:40:28,571 --> 00:40:30,442
And it would've lasted
another 100,

570
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:32,212
if Xander
hadn't finished it off.

571
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:33,782
[Twink] What did Xander do?

572
00:40:33,816 --> 00:40:36,420
[Tom] His laser experiments
blew a hole in the Ozone layer

573
00:40:36,454 --> 00:40:37,890
and it just kept getting bigger
and bigger.

574
00:40:38,424 --> 00:40:39,660
[Bulk]
Astro Station.

575
00:40:46,942 --> 00:40:48,411
[Tom] We're going to have
a hot meal.

576
00:40:48,444 --> 00:40:50,615
[Dickie] And a fresh audience.
[chuckles]

577
00:41:12,927 --> 00:41:13,929
What do you think?

578
00:41:17,803 --> 00:41:18,939
[Twink] Where is everybody?

579
00:41:21,677 --> 00:41:24,583
What's going on?
Where's our escort?

580
00:41:32,399 --> 00:41:33,835
-Do you know how to use this?
-No.

581
00:41:34,771 --> 00:41:35,940
No, no, no. No guns, please.

582
00:41:37,342 --> 00:41:38,477
[sighs]

583
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,283
Here.

584
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:43,521
Point and shoot, right?

585
00:41:45,091 --> 00:41:46,393
Right. [sighs]

586
00:41:47,028 --> 00:41:48,030
[Reno] Hey!

587
00:41:48,064 --> 00:41:49,734
You're not gonna leave me
like this, are you?

588
00:41:50,668 --> 00:41:51,670
Where am I gonna go?

589
00:41:55,111 --> 00:41:56,313
I'm trusting you.

590
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:01,891
Bulk.

591
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:05,431
Everybody stay with the coach.

592
00:43:05,753 --> 00:43:07,890
-[screaming]
-[gunshots]

593
00:43:10,695 --> 00:43:11,765
[groans]

594
00:43:18,144 --> 00:43:19,146
[grunts]

595
00:43:22,787 --> 00:43:24,924
[Skin 1] What was that?
What did they do?

596
00:43:25,558 --> 00:43:26,660
[Skin 2] Nothing.

597
00:43:29,834 --> 00:43:31,236
[woman groaning]

598
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,042
-[Skin 2] Let's go.
-[yelping continues]

599
00:43:34,075 --> 00:43:35,545
[Skin 1]
I'm not through with her yet.

600
00:43:39,553 --> 00:43:43,060
Come on, bitch. Move.
Do something.

601
00:43:43,227 --> 00:43:44,831
-[woman yelping]
-[Skin 1] Yeah.

602
00:43:45,097 --> 00:43:46,200
Yeah, that's good.

603
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:51,677
[screams]

604
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:55,752
[grunts]

605
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,823

[grunts]

607
00:44:21,703 --> 00:44:22,705
Beth.

608
00:44:23,274 --> 00:44:24,609
Oh, God!

609
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,217
[sobbing]

610
00:44:34,362 --> 00:44:35,364
Beth.

611
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:37,602
[continues sobbing]

612
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:53,768
[screaming]

613
00:44:55,338 --> 00:44:56,139
Oh, my!

614
00:44:56,774 --> 00:44:58,644
-[Skin chuckling]
-[Twink screaming]

615
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,782
[grunts]

616
00:45:01,784 --> 00:45:04,022
[Twink crying]

617
00:45:09,734 --> 00:45:11,269
It's okay. It's okay.

618
00:45:12,806 --> 00:45:13,808
I'm out of here.

619
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:17,348
[Sandy] Reno!

620
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:20,121
[Twink sobbing]

621
00:45:24,329 --> 00:45:25,297
Reno!

622
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:27,435
Reno!

623
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:31,844
[grunts]

624
00:45:39,092 --> 00:45:42,298
-Hang on, hang on.
-They killed everyone. [sobbing]

625
00:45:42,465 --> 00:45:44,469
Shh. Hang on, Beth.

626
00:45:44,502 --> 00:45:45,939
[sobbing]

627
00:45:58,530 --> 00:45:59,532
[Reno whistles]

[gunshots]

00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:24,917
[Reno screams]

633
00:46:32,198 --> 00:46:33,902
[gasping]

634
00:46:45,157 --> 00:46:47,061
This is what I get
for trusting you, huh?

635
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:51,169
You could get killed
pulling a stunt like that.

636
00:46:51,203 --> 00:46:52,205
Just leave me alone.

637
00:46:52,538 --> 00:46:53,607
You wanna be alone?

638
00:46:54,944 --> 00:46:55,879
Huh?

639
00:46:55,912 --> 00:46:58,116
You know how long you'd last
out here, alone?

640
00:46:58,684 --> 00:47:00,487
The Skins own the outland.

641
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:03,060
They want everything
that passes through it.

642
00:47:03,728 --> 00:47:05,531
Your only chance
is if we stick together.

643
00:47:07,068 --> 00:47:08,437
I don't need anybody.

644
00:47:09,606 --> 00:47:11,109
[sighs] Fine.

645
00:47:12,345 --> 00:47:15,251
You wanna commit suicide?
You wanna be on your own?

646
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:17,188
Be my guest.

647
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:30,514
[Reno] That one's mine!

648
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:32,986
So is the one by the transport.

649
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:43,674
[Tom moaning]

650
00:47:45,745 --> 00:47:46,981
Oh, I would've been a...

651
00:47:47,515 --> 00:47:48,583
great doctor.

652
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,122
Superior.

653
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:53,393
Oh, well.

654
00:47:54,362 --> 00:47:55,364
Are you ready now

655
00:47:55,397 --> 00:47:58,236
for your open-heart surgery
today, Mr. Smith?

656
00:47:59,305 --> 00:48:01,676
Well, maybe not...

657
00:48:02,678 --> 00:48:04,248
heart surgery now.

658
00:48:04,817 --> 00:48:08,190
How about a gallbladder?
I feel like a gallbladder.

659
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:09,492
Maybe...

660
00:48:14,502 --> 00:48:15,404
Here.

661
00:48:15,805 --> 00:48:16,706
Thank you.

662
00:48:17,441 --> 00:48:18,443
How is she doing?

663
00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:20,815
Oh, about the same.

664
00:48:21,851 --> 00:48:23,520
Look at what those animals
did to her finger.

665
00:48:24,155 --> 00:48:26,359
Bulk told me that she had
this beautiful ring

666
00:48:26,493 --> 00:48:27,561
that her mother gave her.

667
00:48:29,298 --> 00:48:30,334
She's so young.

668
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,279
So are you.

669
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:38,583
What the hell kinda shit are you
anyway?

670
00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:42,591
Why, I'm a doctor.

671
00:48:47,535 --> 00:48:49,338
I'm a doctor.

672
00:48:49,605 --> 00:48:50,607
[door shuts]

673
00:48:59,258 --> 00:49:00,260
[machine beeping]

674
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:02,732
[Skin 1 over radio]
...and where the hell are they?

675
00:49:02,766 --> 00:49:05,504
[Skin 2]
Last I heard, they were
still tearing up Astro Station.

676
00:49:05,738 --> 00:49:07,641
[Skin 1]
You seen
the Neon City transport?

677
00:49:07,909 --> 00:49:09,780
Cedar said it got stuck
in the Xander.

678
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,316
[Skin 2]
Check it out.
There'll be something

679
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:12,251
worth salvaging.

680
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,457
Rendezvous at moon rise
on the Jericho road,

681
00:49:15,491 --> 00:49:16,727
30-mile bend.

682
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:20,367
We can't transmit to Jericho.

683
00:49:20,567 --> 00:49:22,772
And when their friends
don't make the rendezvous...

684
00:49:24,575 --> 00:49:25,711
But we've got some time.

685
00:49:26,646 --> 00:49:28,416
[Bulk screaming]

686
00:49:29,352 --> 00:49:30,354
Keep listening.

687
00:49:31,623 --> 00:49:36,299
Ah! No! No! No!

688
00:49:37,268 --> 00:49:38,738
Oh, God!

689
00:49:41,877 --> 00:49:42,946
[yells] Why?

690
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,933
I say enough talk.
We stay off the main road

691
00:50:09,967 --> 00:50:11,937
and push on for Neon City.
Let's vote.

692
00:50:11,971 --> 00:50:12,973
[Dickie] What if you're wrong?

693
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:15,277
What if it's a trap
and they're waiting for us?

694
00:50:16,112 --> 00:50:17,314
We've gotta go back.

695
00:50:18,316 --> 00:50:20,287
My daddy can wait
a little longer to see me.

696
00:50:20,721 --> 00:50:22,358
-Back.
-There's no going back.

697
00:50:23,426 --> 00:50:24,562
I'm with Stark.

698
00:50:24,595 --> 00:50:26,599
I agree with Mr. Stark.

699
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:31,744
-You gotta vote.
-What vote, jail or jail?

700
00:50:31,944 --> 00:50:34,115
-[Harry] Or dead.
-Then I'd rather die trying.

701
00:50:34,148 --> 00:50:35,450
Neon City.

702
00:50:35,717 --> 00:50:36,787
Neon City.

703
00:50:37,922 --> 00:50:39,492
I'd say there's enough
of your kind already in Neon.

704
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:40,962
I'm getting married.

705
00:50:41,429 --> 00:50:43,400
Yeah, on your back
in your cheap hotel.

706
00:50:47,474 --> 00:50:48,576
That was out of line.

707
00:50:49,178 --> 00:50:50,113
Sir.

708
00:50:51,182 --> 00:50:54,021
You know, for an asshole,
you're a real asshole.

709
00:51:07,214 --> 00:51:08,616
You two have something going?

710
00:51:09,753 --> 00:51:10,788
We had a son.

711
00:51:12,057 --> 00:51:13,393
He was born blind.

712
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:17,034
Had a cleft palate,
some other problems, and the...

713
00:51:17,201 --> 00:51:19,705
[sighs] ...authority said
he was mutant

714
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:20,908
so they took him away.

715
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:25,752
Harry thought I falsified
my medical papers

716
00:51:25,785 --> 00:51:26,920
to the marriage board.

717
00:51:29,658 --> 00:51:30,660
Did you?

718
00:51:31,864 --> 00:51:32,932
I'm not mutant.

719
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:37,574
But they sterilized me
just the same.

720
00:51:40,113 --> 00:51:41,917
[Tom speaks indistinctly]

721
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:43,821
[Twink] And there wasn't any
fresh water.

722
00:51:45,056 --> 00:51:46,526
[Tom] Okay, Mr. Wing,
let me help you.

723
00:52:17,287 --> 00:52:18,590
[sighs]

724
00:52:19,258 --> 00:52:20,627
[Bulk groans]

725
00:52:36,626 --> 00:52:38,964
You know, I used to be a big fan
of yours when you were singing.

726
00:52:38,998 --> 00:52:40,233
Yeah, well...

727
00:52:40,968 --> 00:52:42,304
that's a long time ago.

728
00:52:43,172 --> 00:52:45,945
[sighs] You had
such a beautiful voice.

729
00:52:47,147 --> 00:52:49,151
I used to come to your place
two-three times a week

730
00:52:49,184 --> 00:52:50,253
just listen to you sing.

731
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:52,892
[chuckles] I remember.

732
00:52:55,731 --> 00:52:57,034
So, what's in Neon City?

733
00:52:58,202 --> 00:52:59,204
A very...

734
00:53:01,042 --> 00:53:02,210
nice man.

735
00:53:07,789 --> 00:53:08,791
You love him?

736
00:53:10,226 --> 00:53:11,797
He makes me feel good.

737
00:53:13,801 --> 00:53:14,803
Sandy...

738
00:53:16,439 --> 00:53:18,142
[sighs] Prosecutor Jenkins?

739
00:53:19,846 --> 00:53:20,915
He's in Neon City.

740
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:23,787
He's captain of
the rangers there.

741
00:53:25,791 --> 00:53:26,927
Harry will kill him.

742
00:53:29,799 --> 00:53:30,801
[sighs]

743
00:53:48,837 --> 00:53:49,906
[vehicle door opens]

744
00:54:03,332 --> 00:54:04,468
Looks like we're in business.

745
00:54:06,472 --> 00:54:07,474
Come on in!

746
00:54:13,352 --> 00:54:16,392
[Dickie] Oh, yeah, yeah.
I've heard of this place.

747
00:54:16,827 --> 00:54:20,366
Sal Mennella gave it five-stars
in the Tomane review.

748
00:54:21,001 --> 00:54:23,106
-[chuckles]
-Terrific.

749
00:54:23,406 --> 00:54:25,243
At least if we stayed
on the main road

750
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:27,080
we might've gotten decent food.

751
00:54:27,882 --> 00:54:28,951
Evening.

752
00:54:31,222 --> 00:54:32,390
Sorry,
I wasn't here to greet you.

753
00:54:33,426 --> 00:54:34,428
Welcome.

754
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,465
He's one of them.

755
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,369
[whispers] Let's go.

756
00:54:38,402 --> 00:54:41,542
We'd like a fill up
and we'd like to order, please.

757
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:44,314
All we've got left
this late is a special.

758
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:47,154
-It's real good.
-Okay.

759
00:54:47,989 --> 00:54:49,291
Sorry, I scared the young lady.

760
00:54:49,993 --> 00:54:51,328
[chuckles]

761
00:54:54,034 --> 00:54:57,007
You treated him
like he was normal.

762
00:54:57,307 --> 00:54:59,611
-Some of them are.
-And some of us aren't.

763
00:55:06,927 --> 00:55:08,095
[Tom] Looks clean enough.

764
00:55:08,129 --> 00:55:09,464
[Dickie] I wonder
what the special is.

765
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,639
[piano playing]

766
00:55:14,474 --> 00:55:17,280
-[indistinct chatter]
-[cutlery clanking]

767
00:55:25,063 --> 00:55:26,933
I haven't eaten like this
in six months.

768
00:55:31,609 --> 00:55:32,945
Talk to her, Stark.

769
00:55:52,484 --> 00:55:54,388
Dickie says you and Stark
were married.

770
00:55:55,123 --> 00:55:56,125
We were.

771
00:55:57,427 --> 00:55:59,498
So, why did he call you...

772
00:56:00,768 --> 00:56:02,003
A whore?

773
00:56:04,675 --> 00:56:07,013
I have a few friends.

774
00:56:08,082 --> 00:56:09,084
They take care of me.

775
00:56:09,484 --> 00:56:10,754
I take care of them.

776
00:56:12,792 --> 00:56:14,394
I think I'd kill myself first.

777
00:56:15,263 --> 00:56:17,000
That's why I'm going
to Neon City.

778
00:56:19,638 --> 00:56:22,143
If you folks are finished,
I'd like to clean up.

779
00:56:22,544 --> 00:56:24,348
[Dickie] Thank you.
That was delicious,

780
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,784
delicious, lovely meal.

781
00:57:08,202 --> 00:57:09,704
I've read the books,
they were cleaning it up.

782
00:57:10,206 --> 00:57:11,275
It's getting better.

783
00:57:12,243 --> 00:57:13,546
Hell, the even city
can breathe clean air

784
00:57:13,579 --> 00:57:14,614
every couple of months.

785
00:57:14,882 --> 00:57:16,418
Who is really to blame?

786
00:57:16,886 --> 00:57:18,723
Xander was working for NASA.

787
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:20,493
It was their project.

788
00:57:20,526 --> 00:57:21,763
[man over radio]
Hey, Neon.

789
00:57:21,796 --> 00:57:24,201
You didn't forget about us,
did you?

790
00:57:24,234 --> 00:57:25,636
[Bulk] I didn't know
they were anywhere near.

791
00:57:26,873 --> 00:57:29,444
Stark! We got company!

792
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,462
Do we have to worry about them?

793
00:57:38,629 --> 00:57:40,868
No, I don't think so,
we could probably outrun them.

794
00:57:42,805 --> 00:57:44,909
[cylinder hissing]

795
00:57:46,512 --> 00:57:49,651
-Then again, get down.
-[bullets ricocheting]

796
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:53,526
Pass me back some ammunition.

797
00:57:53,927 --> 00:57:55,563
We got heavy caliber
shit back there.

798
00:57:57,935 --> 00:57:58,937
Here!

799
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,408
And don't give me any shit
about guns.

800
00:58:05,851 --> 00:58:06,853
Dickie!

801
00:58:09,725 --> 00:58:11,662
Here. And use it this time!

802
00:58:11,996 --> 00:58:15,236
-Oh, God.
-[gunshots]

803
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:23,586
[Twink screams]

804
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:39,451
[Harry] Bulk, get some speed
out of this thing!

805
00:58:39,852 --> 00:58:42,557
-We are on fire!
-Oh, shit!

806
00:58:42,858 --> 00:58:45,596
Stark, the trailer!
We gotta lose it!

807
00:58:45,998 --> 00:58:47,667
We got enough explosives
back there

808
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,004
to blow us to Neon and back!

809
00:58:50,706 --> 00:58:52,610
Reno, back door cover.

810
00:58:53,145 --> 00:58:54,782
You got the gun, you cover me.

811
00:58:56,853 --> 00:58:59,759
[gunshots]

812
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:04,334
-[grunts]
-[gunshots]

813
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:12,583
[gunshot]

814
00:59:13,753 --> 00:59:15,891
Devine, grab her legs.

815
00:59:18,095 --> 00:59:20,099
-[Reno] I can't get it.
-[Harry] Keep trying.

816
00:59:24,942 --> 00:59:27,013
[gunshots]

817
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,104
[Harry] Sandy! Load this!

818
00:59:49,524 --> 00:59:51,763
-[Sandy] Harry!
-[gunshots]

819
00:59:57,607 --> 00:59:58,675
[Reno] I got it!

820
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:00,212
[Harry] Inside!

821
01:00:20,653 --> 01:00:22,023
[gasping]

822
01:00:22,056 --> 01:00:23,225
-You okay?
-Yeah.

823
01:00:26,097 --> 01:00:27,099
Damn.

824
01:00:27,734 --> 01:00:28,736
The bright!

825
01:00:31,107 --> 01:00:31,909
[Bulk] Folks, we got a bright.

826
01:00:32,243 --> 01:00:33,813
Each window
has a shield curtain,

827
01:00:33,847 --> 01:00:34,949
pull 'em down, put it in place.

828
01:00:34,982 --> 01:00:36,986
Stark, get up here.
I need your help, right now.

829
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:43,967
Lock out those windows!

830
01:00:46,037 --> 01:00:47,573
You'll have to handle the panel.

831
01:00:48,843 --> 01:00:49,979
I'll tell you what switch
to throw.

832
01:00:51,615 --> 01:00:52,617
Number one!

833
01:00:53,619 --> 01:00:55,623
Cooling system only lasts
for a few minutes.

834
01:01:11,121 --> 01:01:12,925
-That red lever on the floor.
-Uh-huh.

835
01:01:14,294 --> 01:01:15,296
Pull it.

836
01:01:18,435 --> 01:01:19,637
Pull it!

837
01:01:19,872 --> 01:01:21,776
-I am!
-Harry, come on!

838
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:24,748
[grunts]

839
01:01:28,255 --> 01:01:30,059
Put your goggles on, now!

840
01:01:30,259 --> 01:01:33,031
No, no, no. Keep glasses on,
you'll go blind.

841
01:01:33,198 --> 01:01:34,334
Keep 'em on.

842
01:01:35,169 --> 01:01:37,340
[gasping]

843
01:01:39,077 --> 01:01:40,112
Grab the wheel.

844
01:01:42,951 --> 01:01:44,721
You're gonna have to watch
the temperature gauge.

845
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:47,293
Coach is 130 switch two.

846
01:01:47,828 --> 01:01:49,832
If cab hits 140, switch three.

847
01:01:50,065 --> 01:01:52,169
Last-ditch emergency,
pull the red switch.

848
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:53,672
What's that do?

849
01:01:54,073 --> 01:01:55,242
Pulls water tanks seals,

850
01:01:55,275 --> 01:01:57,213
500 gallons on the coach,
200 on the cab.

851
01:01:57,981 --> 01:01:59,217
It'll give us about five seconds

852
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:01,789
to get the hell out,
if we're not out, that's it.

853
01:02:02,223 --> 01:02:03,225
Here we go.

854
01:02:08,502 --> 01:02:09,805
[gasps]

855
01:02:24,968 --> 01:02:26,972
-[Harry] We're above 140.
-Switch three.

856
01:02:34,153 --> 01:02:35,790
[gasping]

857
01:02:42,269 --> 01:02:43,472
[hissing]

858
01:02:47,012 --> 01:02:49,417
[coughing]

859
01:02:50,185 --> 01:02:51,187
Hit it!

860
01:03:24,453 --> 01:03:25,589
Pull us over.

861
01:03:49,437 --> 01:03:50,940
[Harry grunts]

862
01:03:53,111 --> 01:03:54,313
[Bulk coughing]

863
01:03:56,584 --> 01:03:58,488
Keep an eye out,
they could've had some friends.

864
01:03:59,758 --> 01:04:01,327
-Come on, everybody out!
-[water sputtering]

865
01:04:04,567 --> 01:04:06,137
[Wing coughing]

866
01:04:26,812 --> 01:04:29,617
-Can I do anything to help?
-Yeah, get me some water.

867
01:04:33,826 --> 01:04:36,097
-Here.
-Yeah, thanks.

868
01:04:36,297 --> 01:04:39,704
He's bad, he's...
He's real-- he's real bad.

869
01:04:39,738 --> 01:04:41,307
I got, uh, some painkillers
in there,

870
01:04:41,507 --> 01:04:42,777
we'll try to get lucky.

871
01:04:42,811 --> 01:04:44,680
Uh, why don't you...

872
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:47,419
Why don't you go outside,
I'll take care of him, okay?

873
01:04:48,154 --> 01:04:49,490
There's nothing
you can do here, anyway.

874
01:04:49,825 --> 01:04:51,027
Here, Dickie.

875
01:04:52,129 --> 01:04:53,531
Try-- try-- Dickie, Dickie.
Come on, just a little.

876
01:04:53,698 --> 01:04:55,435
Just a little, Dickie.

877
01:04:55,569 --> 01:04:57,573
-Just a little.
-[coughing]

878
01:04:59,878 --> 01:05:01,280
The doc is working on him.

879
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,733
How can we all live like this?

880
01:05:12,436 --> 01:05:14,306
If I were free like you people,
I'd be gone.

881
01:05:15,542 --> 01:05:17,513
Hey, think of a funny one
for this one.

882
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:21,721
What's a guy say
when he's about to be murdered?

883
01:05:21,855 --> 01:05:23,458
[groans]

884
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:28,168
Sorry, Dickie.

885
01:05:28,701 --> 01:05:29,703
That's not funny.

886
01:05:36,384 --> 01:05:37,686
Bye-bye, Dickie.

887
01:05:40,893 --> 01:05:44,200
Bye-bye, Dickie.

888
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:50,245
Bye-bye, Dickie.

889
01:06:07,412 --> 01:06:08,414
Let's go.

890
01:06:30,292 --> 01:06:31,962
You think you'd get used to it,
but you don't.

891
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:34,633
And each time,

892
01:06:34,667 --> 01:06:36,872
you lose a little more
of what it takes to be human.

893
01:06:41,047 --> 01:06:42,282
Yeah.

894
01:06:45,422 --> 01:06:46,825
What are they making there?

895
01:06:52,436 --> 01:06:53,438
[Harry] Nothing.

896
01:06:56,444 --> 01:06:57,446
But it's working.

897
01:06:58,715 --> 01:06:59,985
It'll probably keep on working

898
01:07:00,018 --> 01:07:01,788
for about four
or five thousand years.

899
01:07:02,489 --> 01:07:03,726
Of course,
nobody can get near it.

900
01:07:04,995 --> 01:07:06,297
Oh.

901
01:07:12,509 --> 01:07:13,478
[sighs]

902
01:07:43,972 --> 01:07:45,375
[inhales]

903
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,522
Everybody, come on in!

904
01:08:11,627 --> 01:08:15,201
[device beeping]

905
01:08:39,082 --> 01:08:40,084
Harry?

906
01:08:43,959 --> 01:08:47,232
-It's clean.
-[all chuckling]

907
01:10:17,445 --> 01:10:21,086
[Tom] Stark! Bulk says he needs
some help with the truck!

908
01:10:27,967 --> 01:10:30,906
[indistinct chatter]

909
01:10:39,489 --> 01:10:42,295
Excuse me.
Is this a private party?

910
01:10:43,097 --> 01:10:44,232
[Reno] What do you want?

911
01:10:45,168 --> 01:10:47,272
Oh, that's original.
What do I want?

912
01:10:47,472 --> 01:10:49,242
How about, "What do you got?"

913
01:10:49,811 --> 01:10:51,180
You stay away from me.

914
01:10:51,815 --> 01:10:52,817
Oh.

915
01:10:53,752 --> 01:10:54,486
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

916
01:10:55,354 --> 01:10:57,525
Well, maybe I need your advice,
you see,

917
01:10:58,094 --> 01:10:59,396
I have this problem.

918
01:10:59,429 --> 01:11:02,870
Women say that I come on
too strong for them.

919
01:11:04,072 --> 01:11:05,508
[chuckles]

920
01:11:06,945 --> 01:11:09,516
[groaning]

921
01:11:12,122 --> 01:11:14,526
[gasping]

922
01:11:15,294 --> 01:11:17,565
Okay, no problem.

923
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,469
[grunts]

924
01:11:27,252 --> 01:11:28,889
What's wrong?

925
01:11:29,256 --> 01:11:31,393
-Nothing.
-Reno, are you all right?

926
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:37,272
I guess she's just not used
to being turned down.

927
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,411
I mean, no offense, Reno,
I'm just not interested.

928
01:12:10,705 --> 01:12:11,941
You okay?

929
01:12:14,045 --> 01:12:15,081
Yeah.

930
01:12:16,316 --> 01:12:20,959
You know, I spent all my life
dodging other people's lies.

931
01:12:24,032 --> 01:12:25,368
You wanna know
what really happened

932
01:12:25,401 --> 01:12:26,971
with my parents?

933
01:12:27,472 --> 01:12:28,540
Foster parents.

934
01:12:32,248 --> 01:12:34,987
They had charge of about
a dozen of us kids.

935
01:12:36,758 --> 01:12:39,964
And they used to rent us out
for whatever they could get.

936
01:12:41,233 --> 01:12:42,268
And sell us.

937
01:12:45,574 --> 01:12:47,378
One of the kids died

938
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,683
from a beating
that they gave her.

939
01:12:53,090 --> 01:12:55,428
So the rest of us just decided
to split.

940
01:12:58,133 --> 01:13:01,073
And we threw a torch
at the place before we left.

941
01:13:03,677 --> 01:13:05,681
We didn't think
that they'd burn in the fire.

942
01:13:07,285 --> 01:13:08,654
Hell, we were just kids.

943
01:13:10,391 --> 01:13:12,362
I was the oldest, I was 12.

944
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:20,311
Soon after that,
the rangers caught one of us.

945
01:13:25,588 --> 01:13:27,458
Well, I told them
it was all my fault.

946
01:13:28,394 --> 01:13:30,331
So the other kids
could get away.

947
01:13:34,439 --> 01:13:36,676
[sobbing]

948
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:38,848
And that's how
I got my Red Star.

949
01:13:40,184 --> 01:13:42,488
[continue sobbing]

950
01:13:55,481 --> 01:13:58,153
Things don't always turn out
the way we expect them to.

951
01:14:00,759 --> 01:14:01,761
[sighs]

952
01:14:30,384 --> 01:14:31,520
[sniffs]

953
01:15:27,966 --> 01:15:29,636
[Bulk] Hey, Mr. Wing,
over there to the right.

954
01:15:29,837 --> 01:15:30,905
What is that?

955
01:15:31,139 --> 01:15:33,410
[Wing] Cygnus. "The swan."

956
01:15:34,078 --> 01:15:36,082
[Bulk] Well, you sure know
a lot about the stars.

957
01:15:38,855 --> 01:15:40,591
You know, you're a lot older
than I expected.

958
01:15:42,763 --> 01:15:44,065
Done something to your looks.

959
01:15:45,434 --> 01:15:47,405
And I'm pretty good with faces,
Mr. Xander.

960
01:15:48,741 --> 01:15:50,979
That face was plastered all over
for a long time.

961
01:15:52,883 --> 01:15:54,920
How does it feel
to be responsible for all this?

962
01:15:55,889 --> 01:15:57,491
I was very young.

963
01:15:58,627 --> 01:16:01,466
I thought I was going to end
all war.

964
01:16:02,468 --> 01:16:05,641
An intensive fire that can adapt
to common laser.

965
01:16:06,042 --> 01:16:07,779
You can't fight it.

966
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,515
Yeah, well,
that's what they said

967
01:16:09,549 --> 01:16:11,619
when they invented gun powder
and the atom bomb.

968
01:16:11,653 --> 01:16:14,592
But it can be used
for peaceful purposes.

969
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:19,903
That sure as hell doesn't make
much difference now, does it?

970
01:16:20,772 --> 01:16:23,911
I am certain it can be adjusted

971
01:16:23,945 --> 01:16:27,151
to neutralize harmful radiation
we have now.

972
01:16:27,184 --> 01:16:28,620
So, what's stopping you?

973
01:16:28,788 --> 01:16:30,892
There's nowhere for me to work.

974
01:16:31,493 --> 01:16:34,465
The labs I need are destroyed
or worn out.

975
01:16:34,967 --> 01:16:36,069
I keep looking...

976
01:16:37,605 --> 01:16:39,910
but I'm always afraid
they will find me.

977
01:16:41,212 --> 01:16:43,951
Are you going to turn me in?

978
01:16:46,189 --> 01:16:47,625
[sighs]

979
01:16:49,662 --> 01:16:50,664
No.

980
01:16:51,934 --> 01:16:53,003
They'll just string you up.

981
01:16:53,871 --> 01:16:54,773
What good would that do?

982
01:16:57,077 --> 01:16:58,848
Maybe someday you'll be able
to do it, huh?

983
01:17:03,724 --> 01:17:04,726
What a night, huh?

984
01:17:18,988 --> 01:17:20,859
Look, a shooting star.

985
01:17:21,092 --> 01:17:23,597
-Yeah. Make a wish.
-[chuckles]

986
01:17:26,603 --> 01:17:27,638
Well?

987
01:17:27,671 --> 01:17:29,776
Well, if I tell you
it probably won't come true.

988
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:34,051
If you don't tell me
it definitely won't come true.

989
01:17:36,222 --> 01:17:37,926
I wish that you'd go away
with me.

990
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:42,635
I heard of a settlement
way up north in the Yukon.

991
01:17:43,270 --> 01:17:44,705
We could start all over.

992
01:17:48,013 --> 01:17:49,148
I can't do that.

993
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,696
What's so great about working
in the outlands?

994
01:17:56,931 --> 01:17:58,166
Are you in a hurry to die?

995
01:17:59,035 --> 01:18:01,005
The Yukon's got clean air
and farms,

996
01:18:01,039 --> 01:18:02,408
and people raising clean food.

997
01:18:02,441 --> 01:18:05,347
No chance. It's colder
and it's deadlier than here.

998
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:07,151
No, that's the thing,
it's getting warmer.

999
01:18:07,184 --> 01:18:08,653
I've been hearing that
for years.

1000
01:18:08,888 --> 01:18:09,890
So, what?

1001
01:18:10,959 --> 01:18:12,929
Maybe it is a lie.
But have we got to lose, huh?

1002
01:18:14,031 --> 01:18:15,067
But if it's true...

1003
01:18:15,802 --> 01:18:16,804
just think about it.

1004
01:18:17,906 --> 01:18:19,342
I say, it's more than worth
the risk, finding out.

1005
01:18:20,477 --> 01:18:21,679
[Bulk] Stark!

1006
01:18:26,055 --> 01:18:27,257
We could leave tonight.

1007
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:31,332
-What, take the transport?
-No, of course not.

1008
01:18:32,067 --> 01:18:33,871
We could walk
until we get to another town

1009
01:18:33,904 --> 01:18:34,940
and get a vehicle.

1010
01:18:36,944 --> 01:18:38,781
[sighs]

1011
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:40,684
You make it
almost sound believable.

1012
01:18:40,852 --> 01:18:41,920
[chuckles]

1013
01:18:42,756 --> 01:18:44,826
Look, another shooting star.

1014
01:18:46,229 --> 01:18:47,766
[chuckles] I think it's a sign.

1015
01:18:48,934 --> 01:18:49,936
[Bulk] Stark!

1016
01:18:50,470 --> 01:18:51,472
Shit!

1017
01:18:58,319 --> 01:18:59,321
How pretty!

1018
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:01,025
Fireworks!

1019
01:19:02,027 --> 01:19:03,129
It's the Skins,
we're gonna have to pack it up.

1020
01:19:03,964 --> 01:19:05,133
What are we gonna do?

1021
01:19:05,835 --> 01:19:07,004
Head to Neon City.

1022
01:19:07,037 --> 01:19:09,075
[Harry] These guys are gonna
celebrate most of the night,

1023
01:19:09,108 --> 01:19:11,212
drink well into the morning,
that would buy us some time.

1024
01:19:11,245 --> 01:19:12,347
What do you think?

1025
01:19:12,381 --> 01:19:13,183
Truck's got the power,

1026
01:19:13,216 --> 01:19:14,518
we lighten the load,
we can make it.

1027
01:19:15,855 --> 01:19:16,890
Let's do it.

1028
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:36,262
-[gunshot]
-[grunts]

1029
01:19:37,297 --> 01:19:38,500
That's what it feels like.

1030
01:19:43,042 --> 01:19:44,278
That's the way it works.

1031
01:19:46,582 --> 01:19:48,586
Remember,
they'll be shooting back at you.

1032
01:19:51,025 --> 01:19:52,929
Bulk, where's that laser light?

1033
01:19:53,163 --> 01:19:54,365
Yeah, right here.

1034
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,502
Power pack is about dead.

1035
01:19:59,175 --> 01:20:02,047
Uh-oh.
Stark, look ahead!

1036
01:20:04,318 --> 01:20:05,888
Shit! Hold on!

1037
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:18,313
Here they come, Bulk!

1038
01:20:32,441 --> 01:20:33,476
[Bulk]
Come on, baby!

1039
01:20:34,612 --> 01:20:36,315
Come on, baby. One more time.
Come on!

1040
01:20:42,361 --> 01:20:44,365
[automatic gunfire]

1041
01:21:09,682 --> 01:21:10,684
[gunshots]

1042
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:17,097
Come on, do something!

1043
01:21:18,132 --> 01:21:19,535
Shoot, damn it! Shoot!

1044
01:21:21,372 --> 01:21:22,775
[gunshots]

1045
01:22:02,721 --> 01:22:05,160
[Harry] Sandy, load these.
I'm going up.

1046
01:22:11,205 --> 01:22:12,842
-[gunshots]
-[bullet ricochets]

1047
01:22:15,881 --> 01:22:17,184
-[gunshot]
-[grunts]

1048
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:34,251
[grunts]

1049
01:23:03,442 --> 01:23:04,444
[grunts]

1050
01:23:06,816 --> 01:23:10,690
[gunshots]

1051
01:23:30,764 --> 01:23:32,467
[grunts] Son of a bitch!

1052
01:23:32,969 --> 01:23:34,806
[tires screech]

1053
01:23:35,975 --> 01:23:38,479
[groaning]

1054
01:24:07,872 --> 01:24:09,876
I'm out. Ammo, anybody?

1055
01:24:11,612 --> 01:24:12,714
I'm out.

1056
01:24:14,151 --> 01:24:16,422
[Harry]
Bulk,
get us the hell out of here.

1057
01:24:16,455 --> 01:24:17,858
There's no chance!

1058
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:19,394
Here.

1059
01:24:20,163 --> 01:24:21,632
Aim at the gas tanks.

1060
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:25,741
Push the button,
it recycles every two seconds.

1061
01:24:27,177 --> 01:24:28,412
Go on.

1062
01:24:41,538 --> 01:24:43,609
-[chuckles]
-What the hell!

1063
01:24:50,556 --> 01:24:51,658
You gotta be kidding.

1064
01:24:52,494 --> 01:24:54,732
It worked.
It actually worked.

1065
01:24:55,901 --> 01:24:57,170
Way to go, guys!

1066
01:25:06,054 --> 01:25:07,892
Come on, baby,
give me some power. Come on!

1067
01:25:08,692 --> 01:25:10,898
Come on, one more time,
take me home. Come on!

1068
01:25:28,199 --> 01:25:30,236
-[Reno] It worked! It worked!
-[Twink] Oh my God. You did it,

1069
01:25:30,269 --> 01:25:32,140
-you did it. You saved us.
-[Tom] I can't believe this.

1070
01:25:36,615 --> 01:25:37,617
Thank you.

1071
01:25:38,987 --> 01:25:39,989
Sandy?

1072
01:25:42,828 --> 01:25:44,866

[engine stalls]

1074
01:25:59,261 --> 01:26:00,831
You've done real good, big guy.

1075
01:26:02,133 --> 01:26:03,168
You've done real good.

1076
01:26:05,006 --> 01:26:06,241
We're only a couple
of hours away.

1077
01:26:06,275 --> 01:26:08,579
Leave your stuff,
we'll send somebody for it.

1078
01:26:09,849 --> 01:26:11,986
-How is she doing?
-Stopped the bleeding.

1079
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:14,759
-Can she walk?
-Yes, she can walk.

1080

[groans]

1081
01:26:21,038 --> 01:26:23,042
-Are you gonna be okay?
-Yeah.

1082
01:26:25,446 --> 01:26:27,317
Here, please. Thank you.

1083
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:29,721
How is she?

1084
01:26:30,189 --> 01:26:32,327
I gave her a large dose
of antibiotics.

1085
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:33,897
Something to kill the pain,
but...

1086
01:26:34,331 --> 01:26:36,201
we better get going
before it wears off.

1087
01:26:36,702 --> 01:26:38,639
Mr. Wing. Mr. Xander,

1088
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:40,076
whatever the hell
your name is...

1089
01:26:41,044 --> 01:26:42,246
you saved our butts today.

1090
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:44,217
You can ride shotgun
with me anytime.

1091
01:26:44,351 --> 01:26:45,386
Thank you.

1092
01:26:46,154 --> 01:26:49,327
But now, you all know who I am.

1093
01:26:50,062 --> 01:26:53,068
-You're worth a lot of credits.
-I am.

1094
01:26:53,903 --> 01:26:56,074
Do you think you can make it
to the border on your own?

1095
01:26:56,809 --> 01:26:59,080
With a little luck, I am sure.

1096
01:27:00,383 --> 01:27:01,385
Get out of here.

You're to report to
the ranger station immediately.

1113
01:28:49,033 --> 01:28:50,336
It's in the next building, east.

1114
01:28:50,369 --> 01:28:52,073
I'll do it as soon
as they're looked after.

1115
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:54,344
[doctor] Clear. Clear, please.

1116
01:28:55,346 --> 01:28:56,348
Just put her down.

1117
01:28:59,354 --> 01:29:00,356
[doctor] What happened?

1118
01:29:01,491 --> 01:29:03,528
[Tom] She's been shot.
Skin attack couple of hours ago.

Sir, the orderly will be
right back for you.

Go on.

1122
01:29:16,187 --> 01:29:17,991
You tell Jenkins I'm here.

1123
01:29:18,392 --> 01:29:20,362
Is Captain Jenkins
expecting you?

1124
01:29:21,097 --> 01:29:22,266
You might say that.

1125
01:29:24,404 --> 01:29:25,439
I'm expected.

1126
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:32,019
Welcome to Neon City,

[Twink] Do?

1144
01:30:42,761 --> 01:30:43,896
Nothing I guess.

They don't have to.

Hi, Daddy! Here I am!

Hi!

1151
01:30:59,627 --> 01:31:02,233
Rangers. What'd you ever see
in being a ranger?

1152
01:31:02,466 --> 01:31:04,604
Oh, excuse me, Killer Tomato.

Well, thank God you're alive,
Raymond called from Jericho,

1163
01:31:56,407 --> 01:31:57,844
we got a killer
on your transport,

1164
01:31:58,111 --> 01:32:00,950
murdered a doctor,
took his clothes, took his bags.

1165
01:32:01,417 --> 01:32:03,388
We don't have a proper ID
but we're gonna get it.

1166
01:32:05,392 --> 01:32:06,527
I'm sorry we lost her.

1167
01:32:06,561 --> 01:32:07,998
-What?
-Your friend is dead.

1168
01:32:10,435 --> 01:32:12,439
-Sorry, Harry.
-I can't be sure yet,

1169
01:32:12,473 --> 01:32:13,575
but it looks
like she's been given

1170
01:32:13,608 --> 01:32:15,345
a massive overdose
of some barbiturate.

1171
01:32:15,479 --> 01:32:16,915
Do you have any idea
why that was done?

1172
01:32:18,618 --> 01:32:19,620
Give me the gun.

1173
01:32:19,888 --> 01:32:21,090
-Give me the gun!
-All right.

1174
01:32:21,124 --> 01:32:22,961
-Why?
-'Cause mine's empty.

Hold it there, Stark!
It's a lovely little throat.

01:33:00,469 --> 01:33:01,537
She's dead!

1179
01:33:02,072 --> 01:33:02,974
I know.

1180
01:33:03,843 --> 01:33:05,579
Sorry about that,
I just wasn't sure

1181
01:33:05,612 --> 01:33:07,015
about the dosage, you see.

1182
01:33:07,516 --> 01:33:09,955
But I'm a doctor, Stark!

1183
01:33:10,622 --> 01:33:12,827
I had to give
the whore something!

you had a prisoner for me.

Yeah, she died at Astro Station.

1207
01:34:53,762 --> 01:34:54,931
You tell Raymond for me?
