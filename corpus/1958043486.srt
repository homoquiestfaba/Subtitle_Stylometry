1
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,500
Where are you going?

2
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,875
I'm just gonna, you know.

3
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,332
Nicky, do you
think I should lose weight?

4
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:55,000
Uh sure. At least if you want.

5
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,582
Nicky, is there anything
you'd like to watch?

6
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:16,583
Nah, I gotta go.

7
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,417
No breakfast?

8
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:21,832
What about coffee?

9
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,583
Oh, kind of a mess.

10
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,083
You wanna spend tonight
together?

11
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:30,999
Uh, we're delivering an
episode tonight,

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,583
so it's long hours.

13
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:36,332
But, I'll catch you next time.

14
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,833
Right, next time.

15
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,250
Bye.

16
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,582
Don't say it like that. That's
so final.

17
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,583
See you soon.

18
00:03:18,417 --> 00:03:20,666
We'll make it work.

19
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,874
I don't
know how you're gonna get

20
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,457
these fools to coordinate that.

21
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,041
Well, that's where we come in.

22
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:27,707
I mean, whenever anything
went down in Ape house,

23
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:31,582
we'd have to be the guys
organizing and nothing's changed.

24
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,957
You gotta pick up a little more
slack

25
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,041
since you still live there.

26
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:37,249
They're idiots.

27
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,749
Having them stagger
into a bar is one thing.

28
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,166
But you're asking them to sit
down like-

29
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:43,375
- Robin, gimme a second.

30
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:47,249
Hello? This is...

31
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,250
Yes, it is.

32
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,042
Um, no, I'm not on set.

33
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,916
Uh, well, according to
the shooting schedule,

34
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:01,708
he's off from Wednesday to
Friday.

35
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,916
He's supposed to go in for
ADR the following Monday.

36
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:08,917
Give me another sec.

37
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,124
Yeah. That Tuesday after lunch
could work.

38
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,708
How about 3:30?

39
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:24,292
No, thank you.

40
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,416
All right. I'm back.

41
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:30,707
You gonna invite Helen?

42
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,332
No, I'm going hiking
with her the day before.

43
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,457
So let's just keep this for the
guys.

44
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,707
Whatever you say.

45
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,457
Listen, I'll send you a
list of places later today.

46
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,875
I gotta go.
Alright.

47
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,292
- Morning.
- Hey, what's good, Peter?

48
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,417
You packed?

49
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,125
We'll go to the Getty when we
get back.

50
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,292
And I said you packed?

51
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:04,666
Oh, uh...

52
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:05,750
But I do want to go.

53
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,791
They got some live performances,

54
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:11,625
Beethoven's 16th string quartet.

55
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:13,792
I don't see what's so special

56
00:06:13,793 --> 00:06:16,416
about some douche bag with
the same degree as you

57
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,207
performing in 80 degree
weather and getting swamp ass.

58
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,832
Says the guy

59
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,416
putting this shit on.

60
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:26,833
I mean, I turned down the sound
and you didn't even notice.

61
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:31,124
This is a classic. Right?

62
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,666
You got young Frank
Sinatra and Burt Lancaster,

63
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,082
both in prime form.

64
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,874
Oh, gay.

65
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,000
They don't make movies
like this anymore.

66
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:43,708
Besides we'll go to the
museum when we get back.

67
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,917
We gotta plan for this Ape house
reunion.

68
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,375
I don't think I can go.

69
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,083
What, what do you mean?

70
00:06:52,084 --> 00:06:54,291
I'm going skiing in Vermont
the day after we land.

71
00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:55,125
So...

72
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:56,791
How you gonna miss the
whole gang getting together?

73
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,957
I mean, even Zach's going
and he's ancient, bro.

74
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:00,958
You seeing Helen?

75
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:07,999
We're going hiking in
Tallman or Bear Mountain.

76
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,374
Uh, see if she wants to take
my place.

77
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:13,166
You know, she's been talking
about coming out here for,

78
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,916
I don't know how long.

79
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:16,250
Uh uh it's a boy's night.

80
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,957
Yo, you got any of those
like little liquid bottles?

81
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,792
Uh yeah. They're in the
bathroom.

82
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:53,625
Thanks.

83
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,374
Now. Where were we?

84
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,207
Did you recognize me
from the back of my head?

85
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,208
Well, not yet.

86
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,708
- Your show.
- Hmm.

87
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,749
Right? So basically these
aliens, they come to Earth,

88
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,957
colonize it and then people
either form a resistance

89
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,249
or assimilate to that lifestyle.

90
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,416
Inner fighting ensues.

91
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,499
Ah, cool.

92
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,791
Yeah. It's a neat
premise.

93
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:07,292
And which one would you be?

94
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,542
Which one?

95
00:09:09,543 --> 00:09:11,416
Which side would you be on?

96
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,250
Hmm. That's a good question.

97
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:14,917
I might be a rebel.

98
00:09:14,918 --> 00:09:18,166
Oh. So you're difficult.

99
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,291
Well, I mean, you wouldn't
have to wait

100
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,124
for the aliens to find that out.

101
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,666
- Really?
- Yep.

102
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:23,874
Nicky!

103
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,125
Hey you.

104
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,958
Oh, sorry about that.

105
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:27,833
How you doing man? Thanks for
coming.

106
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,374
Oh man. Hey, did you get the
link I sent?

107
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,208
Did you enjoy it?

108
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:31,332
- I did.
- But did you enjoy it?

109
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,167
- I loved it.
- Good.

110
00:09:32,168 --> 00:09:34,207
'Cause you know Leah's in it.
Yeah.

111
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,457
Yeah, I saw it, it was,
it was a great short film.

112
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,707
- I appreciate that.
- It was great.

113
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,499
You know Nicky's
originally from New York.

114
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,791
- I know.
- Yeah man,

115
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:43,707
I'm actually getting
to know Leah right now.

116
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,542
- Great.
- Yeah.

117
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:45,832
Hey, Nicky,

118
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,749
I will be right back, but you're
still gonna be here, right?

119
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,708
- Of course, of course.
- Okay. Great.

120
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,625
Goodbye Leah.

121
00:09:54,626 --> 00:09:59,625
Bro, tell you, I got
this girl coming tonight.

122
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:02,749
She's this Midwest girl
coming with some friends.

123
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,207
My name's Evelyn. She's
got this perfect ass.

124
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,833
Perfect face. I mean, mm mm.

125
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:10,667
It's great, man.

126
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:11,625
You're trying to like wife her
up or?

127
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:12,957
Ugh. God, if only right?

128
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,166
Us guys, you know?

129
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:15,125
Well look around.

130
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:15,958
Okay. You looking?

131
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:16,792
Yep.

132
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:17,625
There could be a girl in here
tonight

133
00:10:17,626 --> 00:10:19,166
that could be having your baby.

134
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:20,167
Oh, oo.

135
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:23,667
That's crazy.

136
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,291
Hey, you're still working on
that show?

137
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:30,125
Yeah. 'Til... 'til March.

138
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,792
Oh that's great, man.

139
00:10:31,793 --> 00:10:33,499
Does it put you on set a lot?

140
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,542
Now I'm in post production.

141
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:37,542
Right.

142
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,624
Hey, well listen. I'm
gonna do a few rounds.

143
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:43,458
You think you gonna be around?

144
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,292
- Be right here.
- Cool.

145
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:46,166
I'm gonna grab a towel.
I'll see you around.

146
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:47,332
Thanks for coming bro.
No problem.

147
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,208
You, you bro.

148
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,042
Alright, see you.

149
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:50,042
No, you.

150
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,374
And then she decides

151
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,416
she doesn't wanna hang
out with me anymore.

152
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,292
You here for Matt?

153
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,582
We are.

154
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,624
We?

155
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,582
I came here with some friends.

156
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,417
Ah.

157
00:12:06,418 --> 00:12:09,041
I did not know that he
could run a place like this.

158
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:10,042
He didn't.

159
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:11,667
He told people to show up

160
00:12:11,668 --> 00:12:13,957
and now the bartender's
ripping his hair out.

161
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,375
Oh yeah?

162
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:18,207
Where are you from?

163
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,917
- That obvious?
- Mm hmm.

164
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,458
Coon Rapids, Minnesota.

165
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:25,542
Mm.

166
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:30,542
So a one road town with a
coffee shop and taxidermy.

167
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,249
- And a pizzeria.
- Ugh, terrible.

168
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,541
Oo, a New York boy.

169
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:37,832
Is it that obvious?

170
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,416
New York isn't the only
place with good pizza.

171
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:43,416
Plenty of great places in the
Midwest.

172
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:46,250
Yeah. That's like saying
Salieri is as good as Mozart.

173
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:56,625
So how long before you
head home for the holidays?

174
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Let's text.

175
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,917
We could do that.

176
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:28,249
Uh, you wanted to see me?

177
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,332
Hey, let's, let's
go over the ADR schedule

178
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,500
for when we get back.

179
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:35,875
You sure that there's a...

180
00:13:35,876 --> 00:13:39,791
Yeah. But before we get into
that.

181
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:41,791
Oh thank you.

182
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:44,582
I'm not gonna lie. I'm
happy to get a break.

183
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,583
So what's Ape house?

184
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:50,041
I've heard that a couple
times from your desk.

185
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:51,749
Oh that's that's the house
nickname

186
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,791
where me and my friends lived in
college.

187
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,499
Yeah. We threw some wild parties
and that's the name we got.

188
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,750
That's great.

189
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:02,457
Yeah. I'm gonna be seeing a
lot of them.

190
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,124
Derek and I are the only
ones that don't live at home.

191
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:08,332
Derek lives in Texas now,
but he'll be back too.

192
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,667
We still got it. You know.

193
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,292
I'm sure you got a lot of
plans.

194
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,325
You know it.

195
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:20,041
Ah, that's my, my New York
girls.

196
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:21,042
What could I say?

197
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,292
Grass is always greener.

198
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,124
Are you heading home?

199
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,583
Life's here now.

200
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:33,417
30 years now.

201
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,707
We usually go up to Monterey.

202
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,792
But this time the in-laws are
coming down.

203
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:41,375
Is that good or?

204
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,499
Well Cheryl's mom is
getting pretty sick.

205
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,666
So this is probably the last
time

206
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:49,541
she's gonna be able to travel.

207
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:52,208
Can you believe she's never
hiked the Hollywood sign.

208
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,583
Oh, well, sorry to hear
that you won't be going up.

209
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,667
It's okay. I'm glad she's
saying goodbye in her own way.

210
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:04,332
The only downside is
she's bringing the cats.

211
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,041
Ugh. Cats.

212
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:07,833
I'm allergic.
Mm, me too.

213
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,124
I mean, why anyone would
leave the bay area for this

214
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,792
is beyond me, it's much
prettier up there anyway.

215
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,625
Remember grass is always
greener.

216
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:01,875
Psst. Dom.

217
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,208
Dom.

218
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,083
- What?
- Get up.

219
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,416
What for?

220
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:16,332
We're switching seats.

221
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,582
Nuh uh.

222
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:18,583
Are you?

223
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,458
Switch seats with me.

224
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:22,667
What's your problem, man?

225
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:25,417
Red.

226
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,332
Come on.

227
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,707
Come on, come on, get up, get
up.

228
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,374
Come on, come on, come on, come
on.

229
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,374
Can't keep it in your
pants for one second.

230
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,916
Thank you.

231
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:39,833
Trying to fill that
void in your little shitty soul.

232
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,625
Um, wasn't someone
else just sitting here?

233
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,541
Um, no, no.

234
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:00,125
It's, it's only ever been me.

235
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,499
So all I'm saying is it
was rude.

236
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,124
Oh, come on.

237
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,332
Think you're really gonna mad.

238
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,749
It's how you said it, bro.

239
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,750
Words have meaning. Okay?

240
00:18:23,751 --> 00:18:24,875
So just be careful.

241
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:28,082
Listen, have fun in Vermont.

242
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,999
Just break a leg. You know?

243
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,166
I'm going skiing.

244
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:32,542
Exactly. See ya.

245
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,749
I will have fun.

246
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,750
God.

247
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,083
Hey Paul.

248
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,542
Nicky. Good to see ya.

249
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Come on in.

250
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:51,541
Nicky!

251
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:52,832
- Hey Mom.
- Ah.

252
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,166
Hey Nicky.

253
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:55,167
Hey, TJ.

254
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,374
Put your stuff down and come
back out.

255
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,208
Okay.

256
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:03,792
Lunch is gonna be ready soon.

257
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,375
Paul, I'm sorry I didn't
make it back in time for Pops.

258
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:19,833
Your life's out there now.

259
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:23,500
Are you seeing anyone?

260
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,582
No one to write home about.

261
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:27,832
You see any celebrities?

262
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,249
DJ!

263
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,207
- Yeah. Sometimes.
- Pretty sick. Huh?

264
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,749
TJ, that homework better be
done before lunch is ready.

265
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,833
I'm doing it.

266
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:42,916
And um, you still on your
show?

267
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:44,041
Mm hmm.

268
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:45,124
Yeah, show's actually pretty
cool.

269
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,207
It's about aliens coming down to
Earth.

270
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,207
They colonize it and
then people gotta decide

271
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,667
whether they wanna fight
back or, or join them.

272
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,041
I'm just gonna go finish
this in my room, okay?

273
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:02,000
No, no, no. Have a seat.

274
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:04,916
It's gonna be ready in a minute.

275
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:07,374
I mean, I don't see why
I have to be out here.

276
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,291
So you haven't seen your
brother the whole year

277
00:22:09,292 --> 00:22:11,291
and now you're gonna abandon
him?

278
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:13,125
- Alright.
- It's fine.

279
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,917
Paul, how was the service?

280
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:21,500
It was fine.

281
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,957
I'm only asking because-

282
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:24,958
- No, your cousin, Megan

283
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:27,707
brought that really
nice boyfriend of hers.

284
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:28,708
You'd love him.

285
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:31,707
They're gonna make fine parents
one day.

286
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,791
Who knows, if you come to
the New Year's celebration,

287
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:37,500
maybe she could introduce you
to some of her friends and...

288
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:40,292
I'm all good, Mom. Thank you.

289
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:44,457
He shouldn't be lurching
around his cousin's friends.

290
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,292
Yeah. My step cousins.

291
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,833
We're so happy to have you
home.

292
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:52,042
So happy, sweetie.

293
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:19,375
Whoo!

294
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,624
It's good to see you Becky.

295
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:27,957
Oh shit.

296
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,249
In the past I'm so used to-

297
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,125
- I'm still on the pill.

298
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,125
Oh, okay, good.

299
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:36,582
It's a shame you're
only here once a year.

300
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,082
Yeah, but it'd be a lot harder

301
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,542
to get around... your boyfriend.

302
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,624
- Tim?
- Tim. That's it.

303
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:47,291
- He knows.
- He what?

304
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:48,792
He knows what I do with you.

305
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:50,749
Uh...

306
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,291
I always like to let
him know what I'm doing.

307
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:55,332
Sometimes I tell him
immediately after we're done.

308
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,749
It helps him climax.

309
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,750
You see? Yeah-

310
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,583
- I'm mean why do you
think I let you finish?

311
00:23:58,583 --> 00:23:59,583
Please stop.

312
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:19,417
Nicky.

313
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,416
Hey.

314
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:23,042
Oh, so good to see you.

315
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:26,958
Let's sit.

316
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:28,625
Okay.

317
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:35,542
Tell me everything about LA.

318
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,832
Well, to start, nobody
knows how to drive out there.

319
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,666
I mean they have all the
attitude of New York drivers,

320
00:24:41,667 --> 00:24:43,042
but none of the skill.

321
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,249
I'm happy you're alive.

322
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,292
Yeah. For now.

323
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:52,458
So you and Sam are?

324
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:56,791
We broke up, but-

325
00:24:56,792 --> 00:24:59,000
- Right. Good for you.

326
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,291
What about the girls, you know,

327
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,416
you still keep in touch with
everyone and?

328
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:04,541
I do.

329
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:07,374
Emily still talks over
everything anyone else says.

330
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:09,749
And when I do speak Katrin
and Nicole look at me

331
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,042
like I have three heads.

332
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:14,583
They're jealous.

333
00:25:14,584 --> 00:25:16,582
I mean, they're in the rat race
out here

334
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:19,207
and you're working at one
of the biggest record labels

335
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:20,542
in the country, so...

336
00:25:21,417 --> 00:25:24,749
PR, I'm in PR.

337
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,999
So...

338
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,499
Yeah, but it's much cooler PR

339
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,041
than fucking health insurance

340
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:32,791
or for one of those crooks on
Wall Street.

341
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:33,792
True.

342
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:36,374
It is nice to work with people

343
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:38,791
who actually vibe to the same
music I do

344
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:42,416
and share a cubicle
with fellow Dead Heads.

345
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,875
So what brings you back here,
Nicky?

346
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:53,291
I mean, what am I gonna
spend Christmas on the beach?

347
00:25:53,292 --> 00:25:55,416
It's only like my second
holiday season away

348
00:25:55,417 --> 00:25:57,541
and it's not like I have
foster parents out there.

349
00:25:57,542 --> 00:25:58,542
You know?

350
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:03,707
You got a new place now, right?

351
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:04,583
I love it.

352
00:26:04,584 --> 00:26:06,166
Congrats. Congrats.

353
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:09,124
You like all moved in and?

354
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:10,125
Getting there.

355
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:13,792
Nice.

356
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:18,875
I'd love to see it sometime.

357
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,833
We can go there after this.

358
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:33,832
Here we are.

359
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:34,833
Oh, nice.

360
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:35,999
I like the space.

361
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Thank you.

362
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:41,166
Neighbors haven't been
loud, which is a huge plus.

363
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:42,167
Uh huh.

364
00:26:49,917 --> 00:26:50,917
Okay.

365
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:53,458
Right this way.

366
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,042
Wow.

367
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:05,167
Yeah.

368
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,458
New plant.

369
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,207
Those drapes from home.

370
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:14,582
Nice, nice.

371
00:27:14,583 --> 00:27:19,583
And that lamp from
junior year of college.

372
00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:22,458
You made it very homey.

373
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:25,458
I tried.

374
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,333
Bless you.

375
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,000
This is nice.

376
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:21,208
Mm.

377
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:32,167
I don't remember the last
time I had an orgasm.

378
00:28:33,292 --> 00:28:35,667
Oh. Sorry to hear that.

379
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:43,083
But you haven't cum once.

380
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,208
Yeah, it doesn't always
happen.

381
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,124
You know?

382
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:51,125
Really?

383
00:28:52,792 --> 00:28:55,499
Yeah. Maybe it's like
desensitized.

384
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,916
I don't know. Don't worry.

385
00:28:56,917 --> 00:28:57,917
Don't worry.

386
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:00,125
Okay.

387
00:29:05,792 --> 00:29:07,124
Just cause it
didn't happen this time

388
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:10,791
doesn't mean that it
won't happen next time.

389
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:11,792
You know?

390
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:17,792
You wanna see me again?

391
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:20,417
Yeah, of course.

392
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:23,958
Okay.

393
00:30:04,542 --> 00:30:06,166
And he brings us our drinks

394
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:08,374
and my mom asks if he's single.

395
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:09,999
Yo guys keep up.

396
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,291
Who are these guys?

397
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:12,874
Friends from high school.

398
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:15,957
This is what happens when you
never leave your hometown.

399
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:17,207
You were saying?

400
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:20,291
Right? So he's
watching, I'm embarrassed.

401
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:22,707
And my mom tells him
to give me his number.

402
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:24,291
Oh my god.

403
00:30:24,292 --> 00:30:26,332
She's just living in
fear that I'm not married

404
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:28,249
and I'm alone in a studio
apartment,

405
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:31,541
which she always takes the time
out to criticize to my face.

406
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:34,457
But no matter what I
do, still never enough.

407
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:35,541
She should see my place then,

408
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,082
I mean I do have a couple
posters though.

409
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:40,041
- Are they framed?
- Framed? No.

410
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:44,000
That's the difference
between class and sad.

411
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:46,541
Oh yeah. What's the cut off?

412
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:47,582
22.

413
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:48,875
Ah, man, just missed it.

414
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,166
Oo, that's pretty.

415
00:30:53,167 --> 00:30:55,166
Oh yeah, look at the trees.

416
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:57,082
Yeah, no, you don't get this
in LA.

417
00:30:57,083 --> 00:30:58,083
I mean, here you get this.

418
00:30:58,084 --> 00:30:59,416
Then drive down the Palisades

419
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:01,999
and you're greeted by concrete
heavens.

420
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,416
Shut up.

421
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:04,832
Trust me, you'll see when you
visit.

422
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:07,208
We have like six skyscrapers.

423
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:09,833
So you do wanna hang out
again?

424
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:12,416
Yeah. What do you mean?

425
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:15,000
I didn't get an invite
to the gang's dinner.

426
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:17,499
Well that's a guy's thing.

427
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,499
You are going to Pager's
new year's party, right?

428
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,333
Yeah.

429
00:31:20,334 --> 00:31:22,624
So what, this, the dinner,

430
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:25,291
the new year's thing and nothing
else?

431
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:26,917
Oh, there's something else.

432
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:29,833
Who?

433
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,999
Not gonna believe it.

434
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Lily.

435
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
You're kidding me?

436
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:42,124
This is such a bad idea.

437
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:44,457
This woman wrecked you.

438
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:47,166
I just want a nice moment.
Okay?

439
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:49,124
What's a nice moment coming
from a guy-

440
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:54,082
- Just something nice with
someone who gets it, who gets me.

441
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:56,124
So there's not a
single woman in your life

442
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:58,625
that stands out, not one?

443
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:03,666
I mean I'm not a gorilla

444
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:06,375
or some fucking animal
that's just looking to...

445
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,749
you know sometimes
it would just be nice

446
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:14,750
to have someone to come
home to, someone who cares.

447
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,833
Right? Yeah.

448
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,999
So just crave affection from the
woman

449
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,666
who just kept you at arm's
length.

450
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:22,457
Let's just, let's just enjoy
the view.

451
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:25,749
Okay?

452
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,166
Do you have a reservation with
us?

453
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:08,666
Yeah. For Leandro?

454
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:10,750
Leandro. Right, follow me.

455
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:14,625
Mr. Fiorenza, the rest
of that party is here.

456
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:17,875
You guys are late. Your
friends are late too.

457
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:19,958
Okay. So?

458
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,249
- Spoiled brats.
- Unbelievable.

459
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,292
Yo, check this out.

460
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:27,417
Huh?

461
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:28,417
Okay. Okay.

462
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:30,875
Oh my god.

463
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:33,249
Damn.
Right?

464
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,249
Her name's Tanya. She's fucking
dynamite.

465
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,749
Yeah. And she's a, she's an
older bird.

466
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,374
Yeah, she came from Athens,
Georgia,

467
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:41,999
like 20 years ago trying to act,

468
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,374
now she's in post.

469
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:45,374
Yeah and now she's working
with you.

470
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:46,375
Yes she is.

471
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:49,208
This guy showed up.

472
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:51,957
Mr. Hollywood here.

473
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:53,118
- Have a seat.
- Hello fellas.

474
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:58,291
Alright. Alright guys, guys,
guys, guys.

475
00:33:58,292 --> 00:33:59,958
Look what I got.

476
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:06,582
Boom!

477
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:08,041
You still have that?

478
00:34:08,042 --> 00:34:10,582
Look at this fucking shirt.

479
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:12,999
- I miss those days.
- Sir.

480
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,749
Yeah, man. We ran shit.

481
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,291
No one came close.

482
00:34:16,292 --> 00:34:17,541
I'll cheers to that.

483
00:34:17,542 --> 00:34:19,499
It will take all my
fingers and toes to count

484
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,291
how many times the cops got
called on us in that house.

485
00:34:22,292 --> 00:34:23,499
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em.

486
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,707
Okay, okay. Listen.

487
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:27,624
So who are we taking down this
break?

488
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:29,207
I mean, we got our list.

489
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:30,957
The list!

490
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:31,958
It's filled.

491
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:34,457
So let's hear it.

492
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:35,957
I mean some you know, some you
don't.

493
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:38,082
He's a cryptic guy, cryptic.

494
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:39,541
I mean, what's the point
of me telling your girls

495
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:41,332
I went to high school with?

496
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:42,582
No, no, no, fuck that.

497
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:43,749
Tell us about the college girls.

498
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,416
Yeah.

499
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,124
- You know, actually-
- You know what?

500
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:48,166
Do you know who I saw in the
queue?

501
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:49,167
- Who?
- Lily.

502
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:51,667
Oh, Lily.

503
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:53,500
What was she doing?

504
00:34:53,501 --> 00:34:55,207
I don't know. I think
she lived somewhere there.

505
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:56,916
I think 70 something.

506
00:34:56,917 --> 00:34:59,749
Fuck, she used to be
bad. So bad.

507
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,499
She was a good pipe.

508
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:03,958
Yeah man. Forget it.

509
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:05,833
She ran through my whole house
at 481.

510
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:09,541
Matter of fact, didn't she
smash Derek on a balcony?

511
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:11,666
Yes, yes, yes.

512
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:13,874
Please tell me that one of you
guys still have that video.

513
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:15,457
Those two were banging for a
while.

514
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:16,499
Until he got tired.

515
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,541
It doesn't take
that long to tie Derek out.

516
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,333
Party for Leandro.

517
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:30,583
7:30. The reservation was
7:30.

518
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:41,624
Nicky over there had her too.

519
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:44,125
Oh yeah. I mean I had
that before any of you.

520
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:46,582
Yeah. Maybe at this table.

521
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:47,666
Not in our dorm suite.

522
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:52,833
Howdy there, partner.

523
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:55,375
I missed you guys.

524
00:35:58,042 --> 00:35:58,875
How was Houston?

525
00:35:58,875 --> 00:35:59,792
It is pretty good.

526
00:35:59,793 --> 00:36:01,749
I, I'm still at the firm

527
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:05,207
and I should get a house outside
the city in a year or so.

528
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:06,957
Nicky, you think you could get
a house

529
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:08,250
with that Hollywood money?

530
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,042
What?

531
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,624
I'm a post coordinator.

532
00:36:11,625 --> 00:36:14,249
They practically give
houses away in Texas.

533
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,250
- So no.
- Right.

534
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:21,167
And I got this.

535
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:23,875
- What's that?
- It's my CC.

536
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:26,332
Right. Smart man.

537
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,375
When did you get this?

538
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:30,958
Well, it says it right there.

539
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:34,749
You got a gun?

540
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:37,541
When we talking gun,
are we talking assault?

541
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:38,458
Little shotgun?

542
00:36:38,459 --> 00:36:40,082
Maybe a pistol there cowboy,
huh?

543
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:41,333
It's a Glock 17.

544
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,250
Huh? Standard.

545
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:46,417
What?

546
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:48,750
Fuck. Really?

547
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,833
I mean what would you ever need
that for?

548
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,292
Lots of reasons.

549
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:59,124
So when you say AR, are we
talking like-

550
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:00,125
- Name one.

551
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,749
For now? Fun.

552
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,124
I'll drink to that.

553
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,292
Just in case.

554
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:11,875
You see what goes on out
there in the world these days.

555
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:14,833
Yeah man. Lots of weirdos.

556
00:37:17,917 --> 00:37:19,332
What? I'm just saying.

557
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:20,417
It's pretty sketch.

558
00:37:22,792 --> 00:37:23,708
Well it's nice to know

559
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:26,541
that you don't care about mass
shootings.

560
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:28,666
That's a ridiculous statement,

561
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:30,707
but I mean, there's not even a
place for-

562
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:31,625
- How much do you wanna bet

563
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:33,874
the next one's gonna be in the
north?

564
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:34,916
I'll take that bet.

565
00:37:34,917 --> 00:37:37,499
Hey Tommy, gimme an
over under on the west coast.

566
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,625
Guys. Quit.

567
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:42,042
Hey. Guy!

568
00:37:42,043 --> 00:37:43,083
Hey, chill, chill.

569
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:45,625
Seriously?

570
00:37:48,917 --> 00:37:51,542
Happy what you did, ruin a
nice thing?

571
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,916
You know, I think you'll
think about it differently

572
00:37:54,917 --> 00:37:55,833
when you have a family.

573
00:37:55,834 --> 00:37:57,582
You don't have a,
bro, you were too scared

574
00:37:57,583 --> 00:37:59,832
to shoot fireworks on the 4th of
July.

575
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:01,499
It's different. You were
gonna blow your finger up.

576
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,916
Come on, all you's, out.

577
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:03,958
Next party's here.

578
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:06,707
We made a reservation.

579
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:08,916
Which half of you
fucks were late for you.

580
00:38:08,917 --> 00:38:10,624
You, I want you outta here.

581
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:12,457
This bump out.

582
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:15,625
Hey douche bag, you, get the
fuck out.

583
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,417
Come on.

584
00:38:18,418 --> 00:38:19,858
Come on, let's come on, get the
fuck-

585
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:22,125
Get outta here!

586
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:44,291
It sad.

587
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:46,207
It's truly sad.

588
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:48,582
I mean the fuck has been in
Houston a year

589
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:50,041
and he's got the balls to be
spewing

590
00:38:50,042 --> 00:38:52,166
the second amendment bullshit.

591
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:54,458
I am sorry that ruined dinner.

592
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,207
Fucking different down there,
man.

593
00:38:58,208 --> 00:38:59,499
I mean I know John Reed,

594
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,291
but the type of backwards
privatization

595
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:02,874
that those state's spew.

596
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:04,124
Nicky please, no one knows

597
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:06,332
what the fuck you're talking
about.

598
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:10,874
I'm saying he's living
in an urban center. Okay?

599
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:13,624
He's not living in the fucking
ticks.

600
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:16,542
I have some hope he
is getting acclimated.

601
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:19,124
Hope?

602
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:21,375
I haven't had hope since
Super Tuesday, 2020.

603
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,541
Every year you come
home to pomp and applause

604
00:39:25,542 --> 00:39:27,417
and a, and a hero's welcome.

605
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,417
And this year you gotta share
it.

606
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:36,042
Finance. South of the Mason
Dixon line.

607
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,749
Has anyone seen my shirt?

608
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,749
Oh, that's not cool, man.

609
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,124
It's not fucking cool.

610
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:43,874
Dude. Chill out.

611
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:45,707
This is Derek.

612
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:47,999
This is the guy who used to
match you in wizard staff.

613
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,874
And he used to get the shitty
jelly sauce

614
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:53,000
for his mozz sticks.

615
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:55,541
Look, I'm not saying
I'm cool either, alright?

616
00:39:55,542 --> 00:39:57,458
I used to be so fucking cool.

617
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,249
Now I'm a working stiff.

618
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,875
Look. I, I hear you bro.

619
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:04,832
Look, you got something to say
to him,

620
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:06,875
he's coming up on the elevator
right now.

621
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:10,624
Why is he coming here?

622
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:14,332
I asked him to come
over for breakfast stuff.

623
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:16,291
Jesus Christ. Why.

624
00:40:16,292 --> 00:40:19,332
You guys are best friends.

625
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,583
You'll work it out.

626
00:40:34,917 --> 00:40:35,750
Hey.

627
00:40:35,751 --> 00:40:37,207
- Hey.
- What's up man?

628
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:38,208
No boots today?

629
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:40,999
Those were dope, man.

630
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,833
Yeah, man.

631
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:43,207
Saving for the party.

632
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:44,542
Ah, that's smart.

633
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:47,582
So what's going on?

634
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:49,541
What are we waiting on?

635
00:40:49,542 --> 00:40:51,583
Yeah, we'll head out once
Robin's done.

636
00:40:52,542 --> 00:40:53,542
Okay.

637
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,458
I heard I miss some of your
dogging in LA.

638
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Yeah. You missed some like
pictures I was showing earlier.

639
00:41:10,792 --> 00:41:12,958
Was there a cougar in there?

640
00:41:14,292 --> 00:41:15,292
A couple.

641
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,500
There's this other girl too.

642
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:25,749
She's like this Southern bell
type.

643
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,042
- Yeah.
- Poor creature.

644
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:30,207
Fuck man.

645
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:31,792
Some things never change.

646
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:33,750
Right.

647
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,124
I mean if the right girl came
along.

648
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:38,832
Right, right, right.

649
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:39,667
Right, right. Totally, yeah.

650
00:41:39,668 --> 00:41:41,749
I mean, it just hasn't happened
yet.

651
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,332
Right. Just hasn't happened
yet.

652
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:45,832
- Yeah.
- I can't believe

653
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:47,082
I lost that shirt.

654
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:49,249
Oh, I could help you look for
it.

655
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,332
Nah, nah.

656
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:51,707
It's all right.

657
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:53,291
I think it's like a metaphor,
you know?

658
00:41:53,292 --> 00:41:55,833
Like that, that part of my life
is over.

659
00:41:58,042 --> 00:41:59,083
It is a new chapter.

660
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,250
Yeah.

661
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:10,708
Wow.

662
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:16,999
Oh boy. We are outty
five-thoutty.

663
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,666
That fucking shirt.

664
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:19,667
Here you go.

665
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:44,375
- Hi.
- Hi.

666
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:50,499
How's it going?

667
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,500
Oh fine.

668
00:43:52,792 --> 00:43:54,167
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

669
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,708
Do you have any plans for
today?

670
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,874
I'm actually gonna
head back into the city.

671
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:11,250
Oh. Okay.

672
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,250
Yeah.

673
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,249
Why was there something that
you-

674
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:20,292
- Oh no, no. It's okay.

675
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:24,041
I should be home tonight
though.

676
00:44:24,042 --> 00:44:26,542
Yeah. Of course.

677
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,250
Here.

678
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:44,124
No Ma.

679
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:45,042
Here.

680
00:44:45,043 --> 00:44:46,291
Oh, no Ma, really?

681
00:44:46,292 --> 00:44:47,917
It's not much. Please take it.

682
00:45:15,458 --> 00:45:18,333
Hey, you be good now.

683
00:45:38,292 --> 00:45:39,458
What's wrong?

684
00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:43,333
Nothing.

685
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:45,750
Thinking about something?

686
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,167
Everything and nothing.

687
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,708
You used to be
able to tell me anything.

688
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:57,957
Yeah.

689
00:45:57,958 --> 00:45:59,875
Look where that got me.

690
00:46:03,542 --> 00:46:05,791
Why don't we get outta here?

691
00:46:05,792 --> 00:46:07,167
What did you have in mind?

692
00:46:08,542 --> 00:46:09,625
Some sights.

693
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:13,749
- Sights?
- Yeah. Come on.

694
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:14,750
Let's go.

695
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:18,083
Come on. Let's go.

696
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:31,167
Here it is.

697
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:34,749
Nicky, I love ice skating.

698
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:38,249
I mean all you had to say
was you wanted to take me.

699
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:39,167
What?

700
00:46:39,168 --> 00:46:41,041
No, I don't even know how to
skate.

701
00:46:41,042 --> 00:46:42,250
We're here for the tree.

702
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:47,207
Could we get going?

703
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:49,666
Uh, are you hungry?

704
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:50,916
Yeah. Sure.

705
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:51,917
Okay.

706
00:47:35,708 --> 00:47:37,582
Why the hell are we by
the water?

707
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:39,791
It's fucking freezing.

708
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:40,625
Whoa, whoa.

709
00:47:40,626 --> 00:47:42,166
Where's the bench?

710
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:43,207
There's a bench over there.

711
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:45,458
Yeah but this is the
bench from the movie.

712
00:47:47,083 --> 00:47:48,083
For what?

713
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,916
Well I thought it'd be
nice to, you know, sit here.

714
00:47:50,917 --> 00:47:52,000
Watch the sun come up.

715
00:47:53,875 --> 00:47:56,166
That doesn't sound like...

716
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:57,208
Would've been nice.

717
00:48:00,917 --> 00:48:02,750
Look, look it's cold.

718
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,542
So why don't we...

719
00:48:47,875 --> 00:48:49,374
Oh.

720
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:50,416
Wow.

721
00:48:50,417 --> 00:48:51,417
Did you finish?

722
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:53,875
Uh uh.

723
00:48:54,917 --> 00:48:57,041
Is there anything I can do?

724
00:48:57,042 --> 00:48:58,499
No, no, no.

725
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,542
I'm okay. Just need a little
time out.

726
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,582
There's gotta be something.

727
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:26,249
Nah I'm, I'm really, I'm good.

728
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:28,833
I just, you know, takes me a
while.

729
00:49:30,833 --> 00:49:33,499
But it's the second time.

730
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,958
It's, it's just how my body
works.

731
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:39,458
Okay.

732
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:48,707
You have like a, like a
towel, I could dry off with?

733
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:49,708
Top rack.

734
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:51,583
Thank you.

735
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:02,875
Sorry.

736
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:14,833
This is a nice jacket.

737
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:17,875
Who's is this?

738
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:21,999
It's Sammy's.

739
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,250
Sammy's, wow.

740
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,125
You two not cool anymore?

741
00:50:27,292 --> 00:50:30,167
Nice though, wouldn't want
his stuff lingering around me.

742
00:50:31,417 --> 00:50:35,250
He's not the first person
I think about hitting up.

743
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:39,582
Yeah. Well what does it matter

744
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:41,167
what you say about the people?

745
00:50:42,917 --> 00:50:43,917
Orson Wells?

746
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:46,667
"Touch of Evil"!

747
00:50:48,042 --> 00:50:49,042
No?

748
00:50:51,625 --> 00:50:52,625
Okay.

749
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:54,500
What about the cat?

750
00:50:56,458 --> 00:50:58,416
What about it?

751
00:50:58,417 --> 00:51:01,042
That was a gift from him.

752
00:51:02,417 --> 00:51:04,375
Can't have joint custody over
it.

753
00:51:08,292 --> 00:51:12,166
So uh, I mean, I've been
thinking

754
00:51:12,167 --> 00:51:16,250
and I mean there's something
here, right?

755
00:51:18,292 --> 00:51:22,374
I, well, I, I really
see a future with you.

756
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:24,083
You know, like us together.

757
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,500
I don't know.

758
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:31,166
I'll tell you what, you know
that party

759
00:51:31,167 --> 00:51:32,292
at Paige's next week?

760
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:34,583
Mm hmm.

761
00:51:34,584 --> 00:51:36,264
Well, why
don't you come with me?

762
00:51:37,917 --> 00:51:39,375
Why do you want that?

763
00:51:40,292 --> 00:51:41,750
I don't know. It'll be fun.

764
00:51:44,875 --> 00:51:45,875
Maybe.

765
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,291
Come on, how many chances

766
00:51:49,292 --> 00:51:52,208
are we gonna have to go
out all fancy together?

767
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:27,167
I have feelings for you.

768
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,458
It's just that if you
were going to stay here

769
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:43,708
and you wanted to continue this,

770
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:48,417
I would leave him for you.

771
00:53:16,333 --> 00:53:17,333
Nicky Leandro.

772
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:20,375
Never thought I'd have to see
you again.

773
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:24,707
Stephanie.

774
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:26,207
Nice to see you.

775
00:53:26,208 --> 00:53:27,291
Taking a break from being

776
00:53:27,292 --> 00:53:29,791
a non-committal
philandering prick out west

777
00:53:29,792 --> 00:53:31,292
and thought you'd drop by?

778
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,167
Uh huh.

779
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:36,916
I'm so sorry he brought
you to this, honey.

780
00:53:36,917 --> 00:53:39,458
You can do a lot better
than this fuck boy.

781
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,874
Stephanie, meet the reason

782
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:48,207
I'm a non-committal philandering
fuck boy.

783
00:53:48,208 --> 00:53:50,708
Lily, this is Stephanie.

784
00:53:52,667 --> 00:53:53,667
Charmed.

785
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:01,125
Yeah.

786
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:06,916
Well the wine's a hit.

787
00:54:06,917 --> 00:54:07,957
- Oh, there he is.
- Dude.

788
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:09,082
- What's up?
- How you doing?

789
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:10,791
Good. Hey.

790
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:12,916
You still listen to weird
shit?

791
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:14,792
Um, yeah.

792
00:54:16,667 --> 00:54:18,291
- You know Derek's-
- Yeah, I'm gonna say hi.

793
00:54:18,292 --> 00:54:19,292
I'll be right back.

794
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,417
- Hey buddy.
- What's up?

795
00:54:27,292 --> 00:54:28,666
Oh, it's good to see you.

796
00:54:28,667 --> 00:54:29,957
You too. You too.

797
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:32,791
Oh my god. I am so sorry
about the other night.

798
00:54:32,792 --> 00:54:33,957
Bro, don't even mention that.

799
00:54:33,958 --> 00:54:34,792
Oh my god.

800
00:54:34,793 --> 00:54:37,082
No, no, look, I gotta tell you
something.

801
00:54:37,083 --> 00:54:37,958
What's up?

802
00:54:37,959 --> 00:54:39,374
This, this, this whole moving
thing.

803
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:42,832
I, I, I, I don't know if I can
do it.

804
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:44,374
What's that now?

805
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:45,457
Yeah. Houston.

806
00:54:45,458 --> 00:54:47,583
I, I, I don't think I can make
it there.

807
00:54:49,167 --> 00:54:52,167
Like being this far away from
a home, it's getting to me.

808
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:55,499
No, no, no, no, no, no,
listen.

809
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:58,124
You're on an adventure being out
there.

810
00:54:58,125 --> 00:54:59,207
You're spreading your wings man.

811
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:02,249
You're, you're flying.

812
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:04,207
Okay?
Yeah.

813
00:55:04,208 --> 00:55:05,750
I'm thinking about moving back.

814
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:08,667
How can you do that?

815
00:55:08,668 --> 00:55:10,374
You got such a good job.

816
00:55:10,375 --> 00:55:13,041
You know you got, you got
all these things going.

817
00:55:13,042 --> 00:55:14,916
Yeah, but I can do that here.

818
00:55:14,917 --> 00:55:17,249
No, no, no you can't man.

819
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:20,582
'Cause you gotta, you
know, you gotta, I mean,

820
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:22,374
where's, where's your grit, you
know,

821
00:55:22,375 --> 00:55:24,166
you're growing hair on
your chest being out there.

822
00:55:24,167 --> 00:55:25,167
I need to speak with you.

823
00:55:25,168 --> 00:55:27,457
Uh, just one second. So I
don't-

824
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:28,957
- Come on.

825
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:30,457
What are you doing with her?

826
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:31,292
Get off of me.

827
00:55:31,293 --> 00:55:33,624
Yeah and you're gonna
cry on my shoulder later.

828
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:36,457
You brought the girl who
ripped your heart out to this.

829
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,499
Keep your voice down.

830
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,457
No one knows, but I'm telling
you

831
00:55:40,458 --> 00:55:42,624
you're gonna die alone in a
barren home

832
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:43,874
with no art on the walls

833
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:46,499
'cause you're a shitty interior
designer.

834
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,500
I don't need this.

835
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:52,833
Hey girl.

836
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:54,417
Uh hey guys.

837
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:55,250
Long time no see.

838
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:56,624
Hey you're looking nice.

839
00:55:56,625 --> 00:55:57,458
Thanks.

840
00:55:57,459 --> 00:55:58,916
Something he'd like for sure.

841
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:01,958
Oh.

842
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:03,291
Hey, you could be doing a lot
worse.

843
00:56:03,292 --> 00:56:04,374
So could he.

844
00:56:04,375 --> 00:56:05,375
See you around.

845
00:56:07,125 --> 00:56:08,583
You've got a man among men.

846
00:56:15,042 --> 00:56:16,166
Hi Helen.

847
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:17,792
Couldn't get enough, could
you?

848
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,332
They fuck their cousins down
there.

849
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:21,791
You turning into a cousin
fucker?

850
00:56:21,792 --> 00:56:23,249
That's the Midwest.

851
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:25,249
Same fucking difference.

852
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:28,124
Okay look, they're the country's
biggest producer in oil,

853
00:56:28,125 --> 00:56:31,958
cattle, sheep, minerals, you
know?

854
00:56:33,167 --> 00:56:35,250
Yeah but why not Louisiana or
Tennessee?

855
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:36,958
Tennessee?

856
00:56:36,959 --> 00:56:38,582
What the fuck are you
talking about, Tennessee?

857
00:56:38,583 --> 00:56:39,832
What do you mean? They
got Nashville down there.

858
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:40,874
It's a sick town.

859
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:41,708
- Nashville?
- Yeah.

860
00:56:41,709 --> 00:56:44,582
Next to a state that
has Dallas, San Antonio,

861
00:56:44,583 --> 00:56:47,124
Austin, Houston.

862
00:56:47,125 --> 00:56:48,291
Man. You don't know
who you're talking about.

863
00:56:48,292 --> 00:56:49,666
I don't know what I'm talking
about?

864
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:50,874
That's such a downgrade,
alright?

865
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:53,957
That's like saying Roger
Moore is a better 007

866
00:56:53,958 --> 00:56:54,999
than Sean Connery.

867
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,457
I mean it's ridiculous.

868
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:58,499
What, you mean Daniel Craig

869
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,457
is a better Bond than Pierce
Brosnan?

870
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,624
Dan Craig. Are you fuck?

871
00:57:02,625 --> 00:57:04,125
I can't. I can't.

872
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:07,332
Whatever man, you're a fucking
ass.

873
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:08,457
Stupid, man.

874
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:09,417
Fuck.

875
00:57:09,418 --> 00:57:12,000
He hasn't bothered you
in who knows how long.

876
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:15,457
He didn't have to see me
again.

877
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:17,707
And he hit you up all the way
from LA?

878
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:20,291
I don't know what
you're so bothered about.

879
00:57:20,292 --> 00:57:22,542
I know more than these other
assholes.

880
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:25,082
Hey guys, what's up?

881
00:57:25,083 --> 00:57:27,041
The hangs back in town. Huh?

882
00:57:27,042 --> 00:57:28,957
Yeah, most of us anyway.

883
00:57:28,958 --> 00:57:30,041
Yeah, but don't worry about
the guys

884
00:57:30,042 --> 00:57:31,374
who run here are herbs, man.

885
00:57:31,375 --> 00:57:33,250
You guys, happy you're back.

886
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:36,749
It is good to be back.

887
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:39,167
Nicky, how's it being
back your mom and dad's.

888
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:43,749
He's got his own problems,

889
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:45,791
but he sure as shit didn't play
with you.

890
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:47,207
Are you fucking kidding me?

891
00:57:47,208 --> 00:57:49,832
You know what kind of a
jackass I'd have to be

892
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,791
to take it seriously with a guy
like him?

893
00:57:51,792 --> 00:57:53,749
At first. Yes.

894
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:56,875
But for three years after
he didn't show you enough?

895
00:57:57,875 --> 00:58:00,207
Everyone knows what he is.

896
00:58:00,208 --> 00:58:03,249
Fucking Robby Bones
is gonna be a doctor.

897
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:05,083
Nick how's acting going?

898
00:58:06,292 --> 00:58:07,292
I'm not an actor.

899
00:58:08,125 --> 00:58:09,707
You know, I thought about,
I should probably act too.

900
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:11,374
What do you think?

901
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:13,499
Yeah. You know, I thought
about trying out brain surgery,

902
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,082
you know, I think I have a knack
for it.

903
00:58:15,083 --> 00:58:17,082
I might take it up still.

904
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:18,582
Look, if I had known all of
his friends

905
00:58:18,583 --> 00:58:21,499
were gonna gimme grief,
I would've stayed home.

906
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,999
But you didn't.

907
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,458
You're here with him.

908
00:58:25,542 --> 00:58:27,666
We're just trying to have a
good time.

909
00:58:27,667 --> 00:58:29,542
You know what he thinks this
means?

910
00:58:30,375 --> 00:58:32,666
And I'm gonna tell you
something.

911
00:58:32,667 --> 00:58:34,124
When you moved on from him,

912
00:58:34,125 --> 00:58:35,916
it was pretty fucked up
complaining about

913
00:58:35,917 --> 00:58:37,792
all the other men in your life
to him.

914
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:41,666
He didn't have to respond.

915
00:58:41,667 --> 00:58:44,041
You fucking used him.

916
00:58:44,042 --> 00:58:46,707
He would've done anything for
you.

917
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:48,541
And maybe instead of being
thrown around

918
00:58:48,542 --> 00:58:50,291
by a bunch of douche bags,

919
00:58:50,292 --> 00:58:52,042
you could have had something
nice.

920
00:58:54,417 --> 00:58:57,957
I was the one he asked for
help in dealing with you.

921
00:58:57,958 --> 00:59:01,500
I had to hear about how you
threw that Derek shit to him.

922
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:09,167
If you don't leave, I will
fucking kick your ass.

923
00:59:16,708 --> 00:59:17,708
Nicky, come here.

924
00:59:17,709 --> 00:59:18,749
Come here.

925
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:21,082
Listen, will you tell this
beautiful girl over here

926
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:22,749
that she doesn't have
to move to Los Angeles

927
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:23,832
to be an actress?

928
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:26,832
I mean, come on you live five
minutes away from Broadway.

929
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:29,457
You know, this reminds
me of an old joke.

930
00:59:29,458 --> 00:59:30,749
Group of actors from New York,

931
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:33,457
head to the promised land of
LA to make it in the movies.

932
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:36,999
At the same time, a group of
actors in LA head to New York,

933
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,832
'cause they know that's
the place to make it.

934
00:59:38,833 --> 00:59:40,957
When they're passing
each other in Chicago,

935
00:59:40,958 --> 00:59:42,249
they both yell out of their
cars.

936
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:44,875
"Yo, you're going the wrong
way."

937
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:48,542
Hey, what's up?

938
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:52,582
I'm sorry about that.
I had to, you know...

939
00:59:52,583 --> 00:59:53,583
I have to go.

940
00:59:54,292 --> 00:59:55,125
Go, go where?

941
00:59:55,126 --> 00:59:56,916
You have my jacket?

942
00:59:56,917 --> 00:59:58,124
Uh, hold on.

943
00:59:58,125 --> 00:59:59,374
Whatever, whatever.

944
00:59:59,375 --> 01:00:00,791
You guys.

945
01:00:00,792 --> 01:00:01,625
Guys, guys, guys.

946
01:00:01,626 --> 01:00:03,466
The ball's about to drop.
Ball's about to drop.

947
01:00:05,167 --> 01:00:06,833
10, 9, 8, 7,

948
01:00:09,542 --> 01:00:10,542
6, 5, 4,

949
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:14,083
3, 2, 1.

950
01:00:15,708 --> 01:00:17,791
Happy new year!

951
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:29,417
Hey, so you live in LA?

952
01:00:34,833 --> 01:00:36,750
So I'm looking to move out
there.

953
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:40,625
Do you have any pointers?

954
01:00:47,667 --> 01:00:49,124
Actually, there's a lot
of things you need to know

955
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:50,333
before you go out there.

956
01:00:51,542 --> 01:00:52,375
Why don't we sit down?

957
01:00:52,376 --> 01:00:53,832
I'll tell you.

958
01:01:24,542 --> 01:01:26,374
Happy new year.

959
01:01:26,375 --> 01:01:28,332
You know what time is?

960
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:31,624
Jesus fucking Christ.
I'm not in high school.

961
01:01:31,625 --> 01:01:33,791
Hey, you're in our house.

962
01:01:33,792 --> 01:01:35,208
Act like a proper guest.

963
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:38,791
I've always been a guest in
this house.

964
01:01:38,792 --> 01:01:40,292
You don't have to stay here.

965
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:42,250
Tell her that.

966
01:01:54,708 --> 01:01:57,374
You're just not gonna say
anything to him, right?

967
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,375
What else is new?

968
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,041
You're still a child.

969
01:02:01,042 --> 01:02:02,500
Yeah, you're still a grump.

970
01:02:03,875 --> 01:02:06,666
You know, this is the longest
conversation we had in years.

971
01:02:06,667 --> 01:02:08,207
And what are you silently giving
me shit

972
01:02:08,208 --> 01:02:09,874
for missing your dad's funeral?

973
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:11,124
I had to work.

974
01:02:11,125 --> 01:02:13,792
What, was I gonna take four
flights in three weeks?

975
01:02:14,667 --> 01:02:16,582
I want nothing from you.
Nicky.

976
01:02:16,583 --> 01:02:17,917
No time lost here.

977
01:02:18,958 --> 01:02:20,124
Everybody's got their life to
live.

978
01:02:20,125 --> 01:02:22,499
That's just fine.

979
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,874
The day they moved Pops to
hospice

980
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:27,166
was the day of my final exams.

981
01:02:27,167 --> 01:02:28,792
Instead of leaving, I stayed.

982
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,999
He died before the test time was
over.

983
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,332
Fine. I gotta live with that.

984
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:36,249
You wanna be away from
your brother and mother?

985
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:37,875
That's fine too. You do you.

986
01:02:39,042 --> 01:02:41,457
I know this family's no stranger
to loss.

987
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:44,207
I get that. Trust me.

988
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:49,208
For over a year my father
battled that cancer every day.

989
01:02:49,458 --> 01:02:52,291
So what's so different
about the two of us?

990
01:02:52,292 --> 01:02:55,167
And why the fuck are you
the one with the attitude?

991
01:02:58,917 --> 01:03:01,292
How many years did you
get with your father, Paul?

992
01:03:02,417 --> 01:03:03,417
Huh?

993
01:03:05,792 --> 01:03:08,583
How many years did I get with
mine?

994
01:03:10,833 --> 01:03:12,332
How many chances have you had

995
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:14,791
to not be a condescending?
Whoa, whoa!

996
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:16,417
What is going on with you two?

997
01:03:23,292 --> 01:03:24,292
Screw this.

998
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:52,749
Hey sweetie.

999
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:55,082
Hey. I'm almost done here.

1000
01:03:55,083 --> 01:03:56,958
I'm gonna head out in a couple
hours.

1001
01:04:00,208 --> 01:04:01,042
Okay.

1002
01:04:01,043 --> 01:04:03,249
Well I hope this was a good
trip.

1003
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:04,875
Yeah, it was great.

1004
01:04:07,917 --> 01:04:10,207
Because you know, we
hadn't talked about it.

1005
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:11,208
So...

1006
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:18,708
What?

1007
01:04:18,709 --> 01:04:20,999
That look you just did.

1008
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,333
Your dad used to do that.

1009
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:28,208
We used to dance to some
of these records here.

1010
01:04:29,667 --> 01:04:33,207
And he gave me that look.

1011
01:04:34,043 --> 01:04:35,374
What happened to these?

1012
01:04:35,375 --> 01:04:36,375
Water damage.

1013
01:04:41,333 --> 01:04:43,417
Is that a dancing album?

1014
01:04:45,125 --> 01:04:47,249
Oh, you can dance to anything

1015
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,750
if you've got your own rhythm.

1016
01:04:50,542 --> 01:04:55,542
You know, love isn't just
all hearts and chocolates.

1017
01:04:57,042 --> 01:05:00,958
Sometimes it's leaving a note
for someone

1018
01:05:01,875 --> 01:05:03,208
or a kiss on the forehead.

1019
01:05:06,458 --> 01:05:08,083
It's been great having you home.

1020
01:05:13,125 --> 01:05:14,125
Goodbye.

1021
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:16,207
Now, don't say it like that.

1022
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:17,667
I'm gonna call you when I get
home.

1023
01:05:28,792 --> 01:05:33,792
Do you remember?

1024
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,082
That was good.

1025
01:05:36,083 --> 01:05:37,083
Do you remember?

1026
01:05:38,125 --> 01:05:39,749
Huh?

1027
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:40,917
Oh yeah.

1028
01:05:42,875 --> 01:05:44,750
And Mike forgot
to bring the drinks.

1029
01:05:47,708 --> 01:05:48,708
No, you know, I gotta say,
man,

1030
01:05:48,709 --> 01:05:49,832
I didn't see much of you this
time.

1031
01:05:49,833 --> 01:05:50,833
You know?

1032
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:52,958
He's right.

1033
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:55,750
Not enough time with the home
squad.

1034
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:01,125
I don't know, guys, times
are changing, you know?

1035
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,708
Not if I can help it.

1036
01:06:05,292 --> 01:06:06,292
To that.

1037
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,500
Yeah.

1038
01:06:10,042 --> 01:06:11,332
You know, that's just the
thing.

1039
01:06:11,333 --> 01:06:14,374
Now you, you try to hold onto
something

1040
01:06:14,375 --> 01:06:16,875
and then it's just gone, gone.

1041
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:21,749
And the next day we're
getting the queen in

1042
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:22,750
to do her lines.

1043
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:33,750
What's wrong?

1044
01:08:35,417 --> 01:08:36,957
Oh, I'm good.

1045
01:08:36,958 --> 01:08:39,041
Uh yeah, she's in for
the rest of the week.

1046
01:08:39,042 --> 01:08:40,042
No problem.

1047
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:45,791
Break go alright?

1048
01:08:45,792 --> 01:08:47,208
Yeah, of course.

1049
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:52,999
I know it's hard being
away from loved ones,

1050
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,749
parents especially.

1051
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:55,875
I was.

1052
01:09:09,792 --> 01:09:11,291
Why did you already have the
review?

1053
01:09:11,292 --> 01:09:12,707
I told you 3:00.

1054
01:09:12,708 --> 01:09:16,082
Oh I, well, Alan did-

1055
01:09:16,083 --> 01:09:17,999
- Next time I tell you
- 3:00, make sure it's 3:00.

1056
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,125
Now I have no idea what happened
in there.

1057
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:26,958
Oof, little more backbone
Tommy.

1058
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:13,167
Morning.

1059
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,749
Ah, oh fuck.

1060
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:19,041
Oo.

1061
01:11:19,042 --> 01:11:20,082
Here. Let me just.

1062
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:22,541
Just, just gimme a minute.

1063
01:11:22,542 --> 01:11:23,749
Okay.

1064
01:11:29,917 --> 01:11:30,917
Here.

1065
01:11:32,542 --> 01:11:34,917
Eh, slowly, slowly, slowly.

1066
01:11:41,417 --> 01:11:42,417
- It's Evelyn.
- Right.

1067
01:11:42,417 --> 01:11:43,417
Mm hmm.

1068
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,750
- I knew that.
- Mm hmm.

1069
01:11:47,292 --> 01:11:48,874
Where am I?

1070
01:11:48,875 --> 01:11:50,042
My college.

1071
01:11:51,667 --> 01:11:53,999
College? You're in college?

1072
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,500
Yeah. We're in Claremont.

1073
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:57,583
Oh fuck me.

1074
01:11:58,708 --> 01:11:59,708
Why?

1075
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,291
Well, it wasn't my first
choice.

1076
01:12:02,292 --> 01:12:03,874
But considering that my number
one was-

1077
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:06,208
- Uh nope, not what I meant at
all.

1078
01:12:15,333 --> 01:12:16,750
Oh god.

1079
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:18,667
I slept here?

1080
01:12:20,708 --> 01:12:22,916
So you don't remember driving
here

1081
01:12:22,917 --> 01:12:24,082
in the middle of the night?

1082
01:12:24,083 --> 01:12:25,291
- I drove?
- Yeah.

1083
01:12:25,292 --> 01:12:28,291
You stood outside my
window shouting my name.

1084
01:12:28,292 --> 01:12:31,957
Well after the first few failed
attempts.

1085
01:12:31,958 --> 01:12:32,958
Oh fuck me.

1086
01:12:34,708 --> 01:12:35,874
I thought it was sweet.

1087
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:37,958
Kind of like that play with that
dead guy.

1088
01:12:39,792 --> 01:12:42,000
Coffee. Coffee, please.

1089
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,333
We're almost there now.

1090
01:12:51,542 --> 01:12:53,541
It's a nice place you got here.

1091
01:12:53,542 --> 01:12:55,082
I think so.

1092
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:58,666
Creative drawings and whatnot.

1093
01:12:58,667 --> 01:13:01,041
This one with the
rose in the hand in the center.

1094
01:13:01,042 --> 01:13:01,875
Yep.

1095
01:13:01,876 --> 01:13:03,749
It used to be a gun
shooting out flowers,

1096
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:06,541
but a year ago, student council
sent a letter to the board

1097
01:13:06,542 --> 01:13:10,292
saying it was emotionally
triggering to African Americans.

1098
01:13:12,458 --> 01:13:13,958
This is why we need bullies.

1099
01:13:15,792 --> 01:13:17,042
- Nope.
- Yep.

1100
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:21,499
- Definitely not.
- Non debatable.

1101
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:22,667
You're wrong, so.

1102
01:14:04,708 --> 01:14:05,708
Cold enough?

1103
01:14:06,417 --> 01:14:07,417
Yeah.

1104
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,374
What's wrong?

1105
01:14:10,375 --> 01:14:11,832
Nothing.

1106
01:14:11,833 --> 01:14:13,292
Doesn't seem like nothing,

1107
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:18,124
Hey girl, who's this?

1108
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:19,500
This is Nicky.

1109
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:23,000
Well hello Nicky.

1110
01:14:23,958 --> 01:14:25,082
Hi.

1111
01:14:25,083 --> 01:14:27,416
You're lucky to be with her.

1112
01:14:27,417 --> 01:14:29,042
Yep. Sure am.

1113
01:14:30,292 --> 01:14:32,292
Odd, the accent is cute.

1114
01:14:36,417 --> 01:14:37,999
I don't have an accent.

1115
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,541
The rest of the family
sounds like that too?

1116
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:43,208
What? No, I, we speak normal.

1117
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:47,082
I think my stepfather
sounds like a cougine

1118
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:49,124
and my mother straight off the
boat.

1119
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:50,792
Just a century late.

1120
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:53,125
What's got you down, hun?

1121
01:14:55,875 --> 01:14:58,207
What is this? An inquisition?

1122
01:14:58,208 --> 01:14:59,666
Girl trouble.

1123
01:14:59,667 --> 01:15:00,667
Yeah.

1124
01:15:00,668 --> 01:15:02,958
Oo, girl trouble.

1125
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,874
What'd she do to you?

1126
01:15:05,875 --> 01:15:07,000
You can tell us.

1127
01:15:10,208 --> 01:15:15,208
It's a, I mean, you know
when you like someone and-

1128
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:18,708
- And you're getting blown off.

1129
01:15:19,833 --> 01:15:20,833
Yep.

1130
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:23,375
Well, tell her how you feel.

1131
01:15:27,917 --> 01:15:30,207
Uh, there's a give and take,
you know.

1132
01:15:30,208 --> 01:15:33,042
You gotta do like this,
this delicate dance.

1133
01:15:34,125 --> 01:15:35,707
I don't wanna come out guns
blazing

1134
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:38,207
and just make something out of
nothing.

1135
01:15:38,208 --> 01:15:40,667
What is there besides
something out of nothing?

1136
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,042
Wait, but not over text.

1137
01:15:48,083 --> 01:15:50,625
You should do something
for Valentine's day.

1138
01:15:53,458 --> 01:15:56,749
You wanna help me out
with your friends here or?

1139
01:15:56,750 --> 01:15:58,124
Well.

1140
01:15:58,125 --> 01:16:00,874
Nevermind. You got
other things on your mind.

1141
01:16:00,875 --> 01:16:03,208
I'm making something outta
nothing.

1142
01:16:04,667 --> 01:16:06,708
You can put whatever you wanna
see in it.

1143
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,375
Right? Well just gonna.

1144
01:16:14,708 --> 01:16:17,000
Uh, ladies.

1145
01:16:18,833 --> 01:16:20,167
I'll see you soon.

1146
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:23,375
Yeah.

1147
01:16:54,958 --> 01:16:56,167
How's it going, Tommy?

1148
01:16:57,417 --> 01:16:58,417
Pretty good.

1149
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,333
Well take a load off.

1150
01:17:00,334 --> 01:17:02,416
You've been running around all
day.

1151
01:17:02,417 --> 01:17:04,583
I will. When the review's
over.

1152
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:08,666
Yeah. That's, that's
an interesting tattoo

1153
01:17:08,667 --> 01:17:09,874
you got going on there.

1154
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:12,916
Oh yeah. I've
had it for a while now.

1155
01:17:12,917 --> 01:17:13,750
It's for my girlfriend.

1156
01:17:13,751 --> 01:17:15,457
Oh, that's nice.

1157
01:17:15,458 --> 01:17:17,708
Yeah. We first met at
a tarot card reading.

1158
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:25,041
She had problems growing up,
depression and those things.

1159
01:17:25,042 --> 01:17:27,500
She was down in Florida
to see her parents again,

1160
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:32,000
it, it went bad and she called
me from her hotel room manic.

1161
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,957
I tried calming her down
saying anything and everything

1162
01:17:36,958 --> 01:17:39,374
I could to make her feel better.

1163
01:17:39,375 --> 01:17:41,916
I was on the phone with
her for over two hours,

1164
01:17:41,917 --> 01:17:44,667
long enough until I, I felt
like she was gonna be okay.

1165
01:17:46,542 --> 01:17:48,083
Well you did the right thing.

1166
01:17:50,125 --> 01:17:51,541
Her dad called me the next day

1167
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:52,916
telling me that she jumped

1168
01:17:52,917 --> 01:17:54,667
from the window of her hotel
room.

1169
01:17:56,667 --> 01:17:58,708
Oh my god.

1170
01:17:59,917 --> 01:18:04,583
Tommy, man. I'm so sorry.

1171
01:18:06,042 --> 01:18:08,458
I got this to mark the
first year anniversary.

1172
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,250
It's been four years now.

1173
01:18:13,792 --> 01:18:15,250
Wow. Four years?

1174
01:18:18,958 --> 01:18:20,666
I wouldn't trade the six
months we were together

1175
01:18:20,667 --> 01:18:21,667
for the world.

1176
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:24,958
Six...

1177
01:18:27,083 --> 01:18:28,083
Oh.

1178
01:18:30,583 --> 01:18:31,583
Uh huh.

1179
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:21,583
Hey! Look at you.

1180
01:19:23,167 --> 01:19:25,499
One of us had to dress
up for the occasion.

1181
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:28,541
It's just, I was swamped at
work and.

1182
01:19:28,542 --> 01:19:29,458
Oh, forget it.

1183
01:19:29,459 --> 01:19:30,707
It's fine.

1184
01:19:30,708 --> 01:19:32,042
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1185
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Hold on a sec.

1186
01:19:38,833 --> 01:19:40,166
Really?

1187
01:19:40,167 --> 01:19:41,291
What?

1188
01:19:41,292 --> 01:19:44,207
Do you, you really want
me to go get a glass?

1189
01:19:44,208 --> 01:19:45,750
Who are we trying to impress?

1190
01:19:46,625 --> 01:19:48,792
Okay. But what about the rest
of it?

1191
01:19:49,833 --> 01:19:53,041
Oh that, I'm
really not all that hungry.

1192
01:19:53,042 --> 01:19:54,499
What do you mean you're not
that hungry.

1193
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:55,750
I ate at work.

1194
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,667
Why would
you eat before this? I.

1195
01:20:00,542 --> 01:20:04,041
This isn't doing it for you?

1196
01:20:04,042 --> 01:20:05,082
You're right.

1197
01:20:05,083 --> 01:20:07,166
It doesn't matter so long as
we're here

1198
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,750
talking to each other right now.

1199
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:14,083
You know I really wish

1200
01:20:14,084 --> 01:20:16,004
we could have done something
like this in person.

1201
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:18,750
Yeah.

1202
01:20:20,167 --> 01:20:21,875
Well maybe we can when you
visit.

1203
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:32,499
Did you hear me?

1204
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:33,832
Yeah.

1205
01:20:33,833 --> 01:20:35,999
Yeah. You want me to come visit.

1206
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,708
I know. And I do.

1207
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:39,792
It's just...

1208
01:20:40,667 --> 01:20:42,124
Is it a money thing? 'Cause
I'll just-

1209
01:20:42,125 --> 01:20:43,125
- No, it's not.

1210
01:20:44,583 --> 01:20:47,208
Work is really busy right now,
you know?

1211
01:20:48,583 --> 01:20:49,917
Well, I could come back.

1212
01:20:51,292 --> 01:20:53,332
I don't even know when I'll be
able to.

1213
01:20:53,333 --> 01:20:56,583
All I'm asking for is a
weekend.

1214
01:20:58,083 --> 01:21:01,083
I know, but it's different.

1215
01:21:02,542 --> 01:21:03,625
Maybe next time.

1216
01:21:08,917 --> 01:21:11,707
Jesus Christ, Nicky.

1217
01:21:11,708 --> 01:21:13,249
What?

1218
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:17,166
You! I knew this wasn't a good
idea.

1219
01:21:17,167 --> 01:21:18,707
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1220
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:22,749
All of it. You and me, it's too
much.

1221
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:23,999
Too much?

1222
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:24,917
Yes.

1223
01:21:24,918 --> 01:21:26,082
You come back East

1224
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:29,416
and expect everyone to
drop everything for you.

1225
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:32,082
You expect more than what I can
give you.

1226
01:21:32,083 --> 01:21:34,832
Do you really need that much
attention?

1227
01:21:34,833 --> 01:21:38,874
You need to turn a vacation
into a fucking conquest?

1228
01:21:38,875 --> 01:21:40,124
And for what?

1229
01:21:40,125 --> 01:21:44,082
You want me to relocate to
California, lock me down,

1230
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:45,167
make us a thing?

1231
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:47,458
What's next, huh?

1232
01:21:48,542 --> 01:21:49,875
Get married?

1233
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:53,749
Does that about sum it up?

1234
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:54,750
No.

1235
01:21:57,833 --> 01:22:00,082
So let's just be done with it

1236
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:04,499
and call it for what it is, a
fling.

1237
01:22:24,333 --> 01:22:25,333
Fuck!

1238
01:22:30,875 --> 01:22:31,958
Come on in.

1239
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:28,333
Nicky, do you think that
with you coming over tonight,

1240
01:23:29,833 --> 01:23:34,125
um, does that make us...

1241
01:23:37,458 --> 01:23:38,750
Where do you see us going?

1242
01:23:42,292 --> 01:23:46,375
Alysse, I, I don't see us like
that.

1243
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:53,917
I'm sorry, I didn't know that...

1244
01:24:02,208 --> 01:24:03,792
I should have never left home.

1245
01:24:14,917 --> 01:24:17,333
I was really hoping with you.

1246
01:24:19,583 --> 01:24:22,958
I really wanted to come
home to someone every night.

1247
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,417
Alysse, Alysse,

1248
01:24:31,583 --> 01:24:34,083
I promise you, you can get that.

1249
01:24:37,208 --> 01:24:39,291
And I'm sorry that's not me.

1250
01:24:39,292 --> 01:24:41,375
You're such an asshole.

1251
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:17,417
Look at you.

1252
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,458
Doing all right, babe?

1253
01:25:33,542 --> 01:25:34,542
Sure.

1254
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:43,500
You know, I never did
get that Christmas present.

1255
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,833
Let Tanya give you what you
need.

1256
01:28:24,708 --> 01:28:25,958
Call from Nick-

1257
01:28:27,625 --> 01:28:28,625
- Hello?

1258
01:28:29,875 --> 01:28:31,457
Hey Paul. How's it going?

1259
01:28:31,458 --> 01:28:32,458
Pretty good.

1260
01:28:32,459 --> 01:28:35,249
Um, is Mom home?

1261
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:36,541
No, she's out.

1262
01:28:36,542 --> 01:28:37,624
What's up?

1263
01:28:37,625 --> 01:28:41,332
Nothing. You know, just
getting back in routine.

1264
01:28:41,333 --> 01:28:43,082
Uh oh.

1265
01:28:43,083 --> 01:28:45,208
Trying, you know.

1266
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:53,249
Actually I'm, I'm struggling
over here.

1267
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:54,250
What's going on?

1268
01:28:55,458 --> 01:28:56,666
There's this girl.

1269
01:28:56,667 --> 01:28:58,832
I, I can't get her outta my
head.

1270
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:00,707
Where'd you meet her?

1271
01:29:00,708 --> 01:29:02,832
She's actually in New York.

1272
01:29:02,833 --> 01:29:03,958
She's over here?

1273
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:07,582
What are you doing getting
involved with someone over here?

1274
01:29:07,583 --> 01:29:10,374
Sometimes the heart wants what
it wants.

1275
01:29:10,375 --> 01:29:15,124
Look, people are messy
and affection could be hard,

1276
01:29:15,125 --> 01:29:17,249
but in the end it's gotta
make some kind of sense

1277
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:18,291
on some level.

1278
01:29:18,292 --> 01:29:19,666
Yeah, that sounds nice.

1279
01:29:19,667 --> 01:29:22,457
You'll get over
it. You got plenty of time.

1280
01:29:22,458 --> 01:29:23,417
Well, I don't feel it.

1281
01:29:23,418 --> 01:29:25,249
Wait 'til you're my age.

1282
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:27,499
And you start looking at family
photos

1283
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:30,957
where you look like an older
version of your grandfather.

1284
01:29:30,958 --> 01:29:32,624
You mean younger?

1285
01:29:32,625 --> 01:29:34,999
- No.
- Oh.

1286
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,791
Listen. When I
was young, I got this job.

1287
01:29:36,792 --> 01:29:38,791
I was like 16 at the movie
theater.

1288
01:29:38,792 --> 01:29:40,957
Yeah. That one in Suffern.

1289
01:29:40,958 --> 01:29:41,917
Right.

1290
01:29:41,918 --> 01:29:44,791
I started going out with
the girl at the box office

1291
01:29:44,792 --> 01:29:47,499
and we were going out
for a couple of months

1292
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:48,333
and all of a sudden,

1293
01:29:48,334 --> 01:29:51,624
the owner decides he's gonna
hire this assistant manager.

1294
01:29:51,625 --> 01:29:54,124
This guy comes in. He's like 19.

1295
01:29:54,125 --> 01:29:56,041
All of a sudden he starts
paying a lot of attention

1296
01:29:56,042 --> 01:29:57,707
to my girlfriend.

1297
01:29:57,708 --> 01:29:58,957
- Uh oh.
- And my girlfriend

1298
01:29:58,958 --> 01:30:00,499
starts paying a lot attention to
him.

1299
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:01,500
Oof.

1300
01:30:02,583 --> 01:30:04,624
I'm like 16. So I say, what
the fuck?

1301
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:06,457
I don't know what's going on.

1302
01:30:06,458 --> 01:30:10,667
So, I break up with her and she
winds up going out with him.

1303
01:30:11,875 --> 01:30:13,416
Well, you used your head.

1304
01:30:13,417 --> 01:30:14,250
Plus, who knows if that girl

1305
01:30:14,251 --> 01:30:16,041
and that manager even worked
out.

1306
01:30:16,042 --> 01:30:18,542
I'd say it worked out.
Those were your parents.

1307
01:30:19,667 --> 01:30:22,166
I didn't know things were gonna
play out the way they did,

1308
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:25,249
but if those choices hadn't been
made.

1309
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:27,083
You wouldn't be around.

1310
01:30:28,583 --> 01:30:29,624
Wow.

1311
01:30:29,625 --> 01:30:31,791
Don't get so hung up on this.

1312
01:30:31,792 --> 01:30:32,708
You could be stopping her

1313
01:30:32,709 --> 01:30:36,374
from something that
works for them or worse.

1314
01:30:36,375 --> 01:30:37,667
You could be stopping you.

1315
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:41,625
Yeah. That's, that's
actually sounded advice, Paul.

1316
01:30:43,417 --> 01:30:44,582
Good.

1317
01:30:44,583 --> 01:30:45,832
Alright, you're clear with that
then?

1318
01:30:45,833 --> 01:30:47,125
My show's about to start.

1319
01:30:48,125 --> 01:30:49,166
Yeah, you got it. Be good.

1320
01:30:49,167 --> 01:30:50,332
Alright. Take care.

1321
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,832
That some heavy
stuff for the holidays.

1322
01:31:01,833 --> 01:31:03,666
I don't mean it to be.

1323
01:31:03,667 --> 01:31:04,500
It's who you are.

1324
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:06,541
Yeah. I'm heavy?

1325
01:31:06,542 --> 01:31:10,124
The heaviest, but it's okay.

1326
01:31:10,125 --> 01:31:11,125
I like you,

1327
01:31:13,375 --> 01:31:15,374
Your friends see all the
extra work you put in,

1328
01:31:15,375 --> 01:31:17,457
but don't think for one second,
that all that extra work,

1329
01:31:17,458 --> 01:31:18,708
isn't for you too.

1330
01:31:19,625 --> 01:31:22,582
Extra work, so like me
driving all the way out here

1331
01:31:22,583 --> 01:31:25,207
when I live on the other side
of town, does that count?

1332
01:31:25,208 --> 01:31:26,208
Of course.

1333
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:47,083
You never know what's
right under your nose.

1334
01:31:48,458 --> 01:31:50,000
You know I've never been here?

1335
01:31:54,042 --> 01:31:55,250
We'll get you out more.

1336
01:32:07,125 --> 01:32:08,249
What is so funny?

1337
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:09,250
Uh you.

1338
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:10,917
Yeah?

1339
01:32:10,918 --> 01:32:12,083
Funny all of a sudden.

1340
01:32:12,958 --> 01:32:17,958
No, it's just the way you
talk, like balancing your work,

1341
01:32:18,792 --> 01:32:21,417
fun, friends, your girls.

1342
01:32:23,083 --> 01:32:24,375
Yeah. A real laugh riot.

1343
01:32:25,375 --> 01:32:27,707
You don't see me making fun of
your life.

1344
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:30,667
Mm. You never ask me about my
work.

1345
01:32:32,875 --> 01:32:35,749
Your school work?

1346
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:37,499
My art work.

1347
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:42,500
Oh, oh, well, I can actually
see that overlapping with,

1348
01:32:43,417 --> 01:32:44,250
with what you study.

1349
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:45,250
- Mm.
- Mm.

1350
01:32:46,167 --> 01:32:47,250
Mm. Mm hmm.

1351
01:32:52,667 --> 01:32:53,958
- Let's see.
- Alright.

1352
01:33:01,125 --> 01:33:02,125
Oh wow.

1353
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:04,667
I thought you'd like.

1354
01:33:05,583 --> 01:33:06,625
You got skills.

1355
01:33:13,917 --> 01:33:17,041
Well, the composition is great.

1356
01:33:17,042 --> 01:33:18,208
I took this after...

1357
01:33:19,917 --> 01:33:21,917
I, I...

1358
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:27,916
David and I were together for
four years.

1359
01:33:27,917 --> 01:33:29,750
We knew each other most of our
lives.

1360
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,000
It was uh, it was a bad
breakup?

1361
01:33:38,958 --> 01:33:42,375
Uh, it happened after last
semester.

1362
01:33:45,250 --> 01:33:49,999
I don't know how or why, but
this photo,

1363
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,583
this whole shoot made me think
of David.

1364
01:33:53,708 --> 01:33:55,625
And then I took this and I felt
better.

1365
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:01,583
It's really bad when you
expect a future with someone.

1366
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:19,750
I mean, don't you get mad?

1367
01:34:21,875 --> 01:34:26,875
I was, but I'm better now
than I was when I took this.

1368
01:34:27,208 --> 01:34:29,417
He was a huge part of my growing
up.

1369
01:34:31,542 --> 01:34:33,333
And then they're no longer
there.

1370
01:34:36,458 --> 01:34:38,333
And that's okay.

1371
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,667
You have to heal in your own
way.

1372
01:34:50,125 --> 01:34:55,125
Hey, it got me to meet you.

1373
01:34:56,458 --> 01:34:57,458
That's true.

1374
01:35:19,958 --> 01:35:21,666
This house
feels like it's falling apart.

1375
01:35:21,667 --> 01:35:23,124
The bathroom door is broken.

1376
01:35:23,125 --> 01:35:24,999
Hey, how's it going?

1377
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,041
I never get any privacy.

1378
01:35:26,042 --> 01:35:27,624
Oh, I'm good. How are you?

1379
01:35:27,625 --> 01:35:29,916
I'm good. I'm in
a bit of a rush, but good.

1380
01:35:29,917 --> 01:35:31,166
Yeah. That looks good.

1381
01:35:31,167 --> 01:35:33,417
Yeah. It's pretty good so far.

1382
01:35:34,667 --> 01:35:36,166
Well, watch it
together when I get back.

1383
01:35:36,167 --> 01:35:37,666
Yeah, sure.

1384
01:35:37,667 --> 01:35:38,667
What are you guys doing?

1385
01:35:38,668 --> 01:35:40,124
Chillin' like a villain.

1386
01:35:40,125 --> 01:35:41,000
How 'bout a thing

1387
01:35:41,001 --> 01:35:42,332
of popping each other's
assholes.

1388
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:43,624
You help me figure out how we're
gonna

1389
01:35:43,625 --> 01:35:44,833
pay the rent next month.

1390
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:48,042
Hey man. You doing alright?

1391
01:35:48,043 --> 01:35:49,874
You seem kind of...

1392
01:35:49,875 --> 01:35:50,999
Yeah. Perfectly fine.

1393
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,125
Just got a plane to catch is
all.

1394
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:55,832
Plane?

1395
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:57,124
Yeah.

1396
01:35:57,125 --> 01:35:58,749
Okay. You're freaking me out,
man.

1397
01:35:58,750 --> 01:35:59,957
Relax.

1398
01:35:59,958 --> 01:36:01,041
I will.

1399
01:36:01,042 --> 01:36:02,125
As soon as I get back.

1400
01:36:07,125 --> 01:36:08,042
Hey Alysse.
I got your message.

1401
01:36:08,043 --> 01:36:09,332
And there's something that
we really need to talk about.

1402
01:36:09,333 --> 01:36:10,707
Listen, I'm really sorry,

1403
01:36:10,708 --> 01:36:12,582
but I actually won't be able
to take you to the museum.

1404
01:36:12,583 --> 01:36:13,666
He's got a plane.

1405
01:36:13,667 --> 01:36:14,707
What am I supposed to do?

1406
01:36:14,708 --> 01:36:16,082
You know, as it turns out,

1407
01:36:16,083 --> 01:36:17,541
Alysse was actually an art
history major.

1408
01:36:17,542 --> 01:36:19,957
So maybe she'd make a great tour
guide.

1409
01:36:19,958 --> 01:36:21,083
I gotta go. I'm sorry.

1410
01:36:22,542 --> 01:36:24,791
Uh. Wow.

1411
01:36:24,792 --> 01:36:25,792
Yeah.

1412
01:36:29,958 --> 01:36:31,667
Uh yeah.

1413
01:36:33,958 --> 01:36:34,958
Special delivery.

1414
01:36:40,667 --> 01:36:41,667
Nicky?

1415
01:36:43,542 --> 01:36:44,542
Did you miss me?

1416
01:36:45,583 --> 01:36:47,957
What are you doing here?

1417
01:36:47,958 --> 01:36:49,832
Well, I wasn't getting you out
West

1418
01:36:49,833 --> 01:36:53,332
anytime soon and I
really wanted to see you.

1419
01:36:53,333 --> 01:36:55,749
Do you know how crazy this is?

1420
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:57,957
I'm getting used to it,

1421
01:36:57,958 --> 01:37:00,417
but I really came to
give you a dance lesson.

1422
01:37:05,083 --> 01:37:06,458
But there's no music.

1423
01:37:07,417 --> 01:37:08,417
Let's pretend.

1424
01:38:01,042 --> 01:38:02,082
Oh wow.

1425
01:38:02,083 --> 01:38:03,083
I gotta go.

1426
01:38:04,083 --> 01:38:05,833
- Where?
- Back home.

1427
01:38:09,542 --> 01:38:11,124
You came here just for this?

1428
01:38:11,125 --> 01:38:12,792
Yes I did.

1429
01:38:14,583 --> 01:38:16,999
So the airport?

1430
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,250
Yeah, I got it covered.

1431
01:38:21,417 --> 01:38:23,000
I had a lovely night.

1432
01:38:25,625 --> 01:38:28,542
I couldn't ask for anything
more.

1433
01:38:30,542 --> 01:38:32,457
I'll let you know when I land.

1434
01:38:32,458 --> 01:38:33,458
Yes.

1435
01:38:39,417 --> 01:38:41,292
Let's see what happens in a
month.

1436
01:38:45,167 --> 01:38:46,792
And there's always this summer.

1437
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:50,750
Goodbye.
