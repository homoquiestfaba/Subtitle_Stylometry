00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,720
SALLY: Why not just leavehim back in the alley?

190
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,880
CHARLIE: Ah, jesus, Sally.

191
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,720
It's all about trust.

192
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,080
SALLY: You're not
talking sense, Charlie.

193
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,800
A cop doesn't
fucking kill somebody.

194
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,760
Not even a fucking scumbag.

195
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,440
Mother fucker.

196
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,800
Charlie.

197
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,520
Son of a bitch.

198
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,960
Charlie, god dammit.
Stop it.

199
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,840
Fucking ass.

200
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,320
Stop it, Charlie.

201
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,240
Charlie?

202
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Stop it.

203
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,280
No.

204
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,760
Let go of me.

205
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,240
[crying]

206
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,240
CHARLIE: It's all
fucking [inaudible]

207
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,720
[music playing]

208
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,240
Charlie!

209
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,120
Charlie!

210
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,600
Mother fucker--

211
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,080
Charlie-- [crying]

212
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,040
Oh, Jesus.

213
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,040
Oh, Jesus.

214
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,000
Charlie!

215
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,920
CHARLIE: Just go.

216
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,000
What am I supposed to do?

217
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,800
Go home and keep
your mouth shut.

218
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,200
You've got blood on your face.

219
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,080
[music playing]

220
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,840
Fucking, fuck.

221
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,760
Fuck.

222
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,200
Fuck.

223
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,240
What the hell is going on?

224
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,720
Got a fucking cop!

225
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,640
Fuck, Sam.

226
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,600
You dumb son of a bitch.

227
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,080
[sniffs]

228
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,840
CAPTAIN: Charlie,
I'm sorry about Sam.

229
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,800
I know what you guys were.

230
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,720
But life goes on.

231
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,440
Now, here's how the
caseload stacks up.

232
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,680
Halloway and Orlanser aregoing to do the Levinson case.

233
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,840
No fucking way, Cap.

234
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,960
That's my case.

235
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,320
It happened in
their jurisdiction

236
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,080
and on their watch.
OK?

237
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,040
Fellas-- take it easy.

238
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,200
Yeah, I just told Charliethat you guys are going

239
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,240
to be handling the Levinsoncase and if you need extra help,

240
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,680
you have it.

241
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,880
Ah, I think we'd like togo it alone for a while.

242
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,400
Yeah.

243
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,440
Charlie, can you tellthese guys anything else that

244
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,400
may have happened last night?

245
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,520
It's all in the report.

246
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,800
Pretty damn
detailed too, Charlie.

247
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,120
Thanks for that.

248
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,600
CAPTAIN: Picked up a
floater this morning.

249
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,960
Preliminaries indicate thathe was dumped in the Bay

250
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,440
either late last night
or early this morning.

251
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,640
Nobody knows.
- Mm.

252
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,680
Just another fun-filled
day in the city.

253
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,960
Did they ID him?

254
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,560
Yeah, one of your
snitches, Leon Winch.

255
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,800
CAPTAIN: Guys, can
you get me Murrow?

256
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,360
- Sure.- Sorry about Sam, Charlie.

257
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,280
Yeah.

258
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,360
Thanks.

259
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,720
OK.

260
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,960
I know you want to keep
busy, and because you

261
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,200
knew this guy and
his world, I'm going

262
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,520
to give you the Winch case.

263
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,760
I don't think
that's a good idea.

264
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,200
It's a very good idea.

265
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,360
And don't get your noseout of joint on this one,

266
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,560
but here comes your new partner.

267
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,440
Michael?

268
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,920
Oh, shit.

269
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,880
Mike Murrow meet yournew partner, Charles Falon.

270
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,320
It's an honor to meet
you, Detective Falon.

271
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,800
Under normal
circumstances I would

272
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,320
give this to another team.

273
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,240
So let's be
normal on this one.

274
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,840
CAPTAIN: Yeah, no.

275
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,400
Uh-- look, he's going to fillyou in on this guy, Winch.

276
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,760
OK?
And everything, right?

277
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
You're going to do the
right thing, are you?

278
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,120
You're not going
to be an asshole.

279
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,280
And you've got to
understand that I

280
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,320
know what you're going through.

281
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,320
You capisce?

282
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,920
I'm old and deaf,
but I understand.

283
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,120
Be careful who
you go to bed with.

284
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,880
CHARLIE: Coming through.
Excuse us.

285
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,800
MURROW: Excuse me.

286
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,360
[interposing voices]

287
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,160
CHARLIE: There's one smallbit of information you

288
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,040
got to understand real fast.

289
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,160
There's the law,
and there's justice.

290
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,840
It's best if you
understand one has

291
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,880
nothing to do with the other.

292
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,680
Me, I side with justice.

293
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,520
The law can take care of itself.

294
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,960
That's, uh-- a little cynical.

295
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,680
Don't you think?

296
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,720
Cynic's just a
soured romantic, kid.

297
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,120
Say, Jerry?
- Charlie.

298
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,280
Ray.

299
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,880
What have you got?

300
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,480
Oh, a few tire prints.

301
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,800
Some shoe prints in
the mud over there.

302
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,280
Not much help.

303
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,280
No, not much.

304
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,680
[music playing]

305
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,880
Stick around here, maybeyou'll learn something.

306
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,800
I'll call you.

307
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,640
Jerry, this here is the
shooter from Chinatown.

308
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
Be good to him.

309
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,720
Might get lucky.

310
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:43,080
CHARLIE: Bless me father,for I have sinned.

311
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,400
I killed a slimy,
no-good, son of a bitch.

312
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,840
He took the life
of a good friend.

313
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,680
My partner was the only thingI had in this lousy world.

314
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,720
I just want you to know thatI know what I did was wrong.

315
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,160
But I'd do it
again, if I had to.

316
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,680
[crying]

317
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,000
Have you come to
give your confession?

318
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,720
Uh-- no, thanks, padre, I'vealready been taken care of.

319
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,760
Have a nice morning.

320
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,160
WOMAN: What is on your mind?

321
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,160
MURROW: It's just, it's myfirst homicide assignment

322
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,760
and my partners a wacko.

323
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,920
What?

324
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,000
You don't get
along with the man?

325
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,880
That's just it.

326
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,360
I don't know.

327
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,360
I mean, he's got decorationscoming out of his ears.

328
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,320
He's got commendations
as long as my leg and--

329
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,960
And--

330
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,880
He's very cynical.

331
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,640
Well, I guess his
partner's death

332
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,680
must have really hit home.

333
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,520
Hell, you live with a guy thatlong, working together and all,

334
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,800
something's got to
grow, somethings

335
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,880
got to develop between you.

336
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,400
I don't know.

337
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,560
Do you want to maybe
go away for a few days?

338
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,720
I'd really like to
get to know this guy.

339
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,280
We could spend an
entire weekend in bed.

340
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,120
Sure.

341
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,120
Come on.

342
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,200
What do you say?

343
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,840
We could make passionate love.

344
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,800
Mm.

345
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,440
I could learn a
lot from this guy.

346
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,920
You could learn a
hell of a lot from me.

347
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,440
[music playing]

348
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,360
[gunshots]

349
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,040
Jerry.

350
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,080
Clean and neat, Charlie.

351
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,960
Some unwanted guests showup during the transaction.

352
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,920
They want a piece of the pie.

353
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,280
Nobody wants to share.

354
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,760
Bang, bang, guests
take the whole pie.

355
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,240
Fuck the friends.

356
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,440
Was that why?

357
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,640
Does Steve Young
throw a football

358
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,280
like threading the needle?

359
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
Remember him, Charlie?

360
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:36,600
Jose Alvarez Santiago BentinoDiego, AKA Willy Wasserman.

361
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,200
Can you imagine that
bill, fucking Wasserman.

362
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,200
Certainly you
would know them all.

363
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,120
Why did you call us?

364
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,120
I found this on Wasserman.

365
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,200
It's got a name and address.

366
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,160
Jeez.

367
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,360
What happened to your hand?

368
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,360
Caught in a mousetrap.

369
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,440
Friend of Winch.

370
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,720
A low-life like

and tire prints.

00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,320
Now, down to business.

558
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,160
Wipe your face.

559
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,000
Falon?

560
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,160
Sorry, Police Detective
Murrow, the Mink.

561
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,120
His real name was
Harold Kinclowski.

562
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,840
Listen, you turd, you'rewhat's known in street parlance

563
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,040
as a small-time,
no-good mother fucking,

564
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,920
ass-licking scumbag of awart on humanity's backside.

565
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,160
Deals drugs and shit.

566
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,960
Why don't you correct me
if I'm wrong here, Mink.

567
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,920
OK

568
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,000
He uses more than he sells.

569
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,680
He's also one of
Winch's gophers.

570
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,360
What can tell Detective
Murrow here about Winch?

571
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,280
There's some big deal pending.

572
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,200
Winch was in on it.

573
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,360
I don't know how.

574
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,000
But the guy was
setting something up.

575
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,000
What about Mink?

576
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,040
I honestly don't know.

577
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,680
I swear to God.

578
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,200
But people on the street,told me to shy away from him.

579
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,600
There was something funnyabout Winch, you know?

580
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,800
I mean, he-- he wasn'twhat he was supposed to be.

581
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,600
You know?
I mean, he wasn't right.

582
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,200
You could sense it, man.

583
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,800
he had his own personal agenda.

584
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,400
Agenda-- jesus christ,
listen to these people.

585
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,640
Something else--

586
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,680
What?

587
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,000
Levinson-- what
have you heard?

588
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,880
Uh-uh, No.

589
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,640
Not me, Falon, no.

590
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,800
Boil me in fucking piss.

591
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,520
I don't know shit
about that. huh-uh.

592
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,520
No, no, nothing.

593
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,400
No fucking way.

594
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,320
Fuck.

595
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,120
Fuck you.

five, step forward.

597
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,360
Turn around.

598
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,680
And around.

599
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,080
And step back, please.

600
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,560
What do you think?

601
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,920
I don't know what the hellI'm doing here, Captain.

602
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,000
I told these guys there
was nothing to see.

603
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,200
This is a waste of my time.

604
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,120
Mm-hm.

605
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,000

606

Thanks for coming in.

If you get any ideas,
even in your sleep,

610
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,760
will you contact me?

611
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,080
Get in touch with me?
Will you?

612
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,000
Sure.

613

You know what we
got here, stugots!

615
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,800
Doesn't really matter.

616
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,760
We know the son
of a bitch did it.

617
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,440
We'll nail them in other ways.

618
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,960
Be nice to have a positive ID.

619
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,080
Maybe we ought to talk tosome of Jerome's friends.

620
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,080
Bet your ass.

621
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,400
I'll tell you something.

622
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,840
The same guys that iced
the warehouse group

623
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,080
also killed Levinson.

624
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,880
It's all one big family.
CAPTAIN: Mm-hm.

625
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,080
We're going to
play show and tell.

626
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,360
All right?

627
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,440
Just the facts ma'am,
just like Dragnet.

628
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,360
Capisce?

629
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,720
Yeah, sir.

630
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,680
Take care, Charlie.

631
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,240
Yeah.

00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,280

That lineup.

Nobody saw jack shit.
I know that kid.

636
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,720
He's no killer.

637
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,280
Well, they think that
he was there that night.

638
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,720
They think he's
involved somehow.

639
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,480
They want to see if theycan get an ID at the bar.

640
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
Would you follow me please?

641
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,360

642
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,680
Can you give me an
idea of when there's

643
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,040
an end to these taxi receipts?

644
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,080
Huh?

645
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,760
Look at this.

646
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,920
Look, if the lousy mayorcan take a fucking limo,

647
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,280
we can take cabs.

648
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,640
You know what you can take?

649
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,480
The vehicle that the San
Francisco PD gives you.

You are an adult. You
are middle-aged man.

653

Do you understand,
it is at an end.

654
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,160
This is not IBM.

655
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,720
It's over, finished.

656

made with myself.

Don't pay any attention.

664

I go to go to the southwest.

665

If you like the southwest,that's where it is.

666
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,240
You see, that's where
there's a lot of space.

667
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,520
Only you need a pony,
just like Shane had.

Style?

688

What's style got to do with it?

689
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,880
Used to be, 90% of
police work was style.

00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,000
OK.

740
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:02,920
Come on.

741
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,960
[interposing voices]

742
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,920
Have a seat here.

743
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:07,880
Get in.

744
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,600
[knocking]

745
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,640
The Dr. Falon.

746
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,120
Just Falon.

747
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,120
Nectar of the gods.

748
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,240
Thank you.

749
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,600
Please come in.

750
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,480
Thank you.

751
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,520
Can I offer you a drink?

752
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,840
Scotch, neat.

753
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,680
Your husband is one
of the few cops I know

754
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,840
who hangs his hat on Nob Hill.

755
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:55,840
Most live in Oakland.

756
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,800
Where do you call
home, Detective Falon?

757
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,360
Just Falon.

758
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,400
North Beach.

759
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,720
Hey, Charlie.

760
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,480
Uh-- welcome to our home.

761
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,400
Yeah.

762
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,240
Thanks for coming by.

763
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,280
So, uh--

764
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,560
What do you do?

765
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,000
I'm a clothing designer.

766
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,880
Actually, she's justtrying a new line at, uh--

767
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,160
Macy's.

768
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,040
Swell.

769
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,200
- Um--
- Shall we eat?

770
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,560
Yeah.

771
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,560
You hungry?

772
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,920
MURROW: Here's to, uh-- my hero.

773
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,800
That's you, honey.

774
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,960
Are you married,
Detective Falon?

775
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,440
The only broad I
ever had was the job.

776
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,880
Broad-- I haven't heard
that term used in years.

777
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,640
[laughs]

778
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,960
Women only make
things more difficult.

779
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:03,920
You ever live in Berkeley?

780
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,560
Do they?

781
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,920
Berkeley's too expensive.

782
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,960
Sure as shit, they do.

783
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,360
Things have changed.

784
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,800
Take this food here.

785
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,520
Is there a problem
with the food?

786
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,960
No, it's fine,
for store bought.

787
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,000
No more home cooking these days.

788
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:40,200
Women would rather be
doing something else,

789
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:48,080
working out at the gym,
jogging, making money.

790
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,440
You don't like
the competition?

791
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,320
Honey, did we tell
you what happened today?

792
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,600
It has nothing to do
with the competition.

793
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,400
It's roles-- who does what.

794
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,840
And you probably
think the wife should be

795
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,840
at home, cooking and cleaning.

796
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,120
Bet your little tooshie.

797
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,080
OK.

798
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,360
It's her god-given
task in life.

799
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,720
Ah.

800
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,440
MURROW: Come on, guys,
yeah, um-- can we just

801
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,760
like change the subject here.

802
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,320
Just a second, Mikey.

803
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,720
Mikey?

804
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:15,760
It's Mike.

805
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,160
[laughs]

806
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,600
Nobody knows who
they are anymore.

807
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,520
How about another scotch?

808
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,320
How about one?

809
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,840
How about another
topic, honey, please?

810
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,680
Is this how you
relate to your job?

811
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,480
Used to be the good
guys were the good guys

812
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,640
and the bad guys
were the bad guys.

813
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,200
Now it's piss and
shit, who's who.

814
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,640
Can't be all-- uh--, thatkind of dry anymore, though.

815
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,840
No.

816
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,200
I mean--

817
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:01,400
Good cop tries like
hell, does his best.

818
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,320
What does he get for it--

819
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,720
can't send his kids to
a good college, can't

820
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,280
afford a decent place to live--

821
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,840
why?

822
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,120
I don't think that's true.

823
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,920
CHARLIE: Oh lady,
look around here.

824
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,040
Who plays the load
around this place?

825
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:19,960
Mikey, here?

826
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:20,960
No fucking way.

827
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,880
You do.

828
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,360
Your money.

829
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:29,800
I'll bet it eats at himevery stinking, fucking day.

830
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,520
Does it eat at you, Mikey?

831
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,560
Could we just talk
about something else?

832
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,560
He's not going to admit
it, at least not to you.

833
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:45,640
What man likes his balls handedover to him on a plastic dish?

834
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,640
No clear lines.

835
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:06,040
A good cop gets killed
by number one scumbag

836
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,280
of a fucking drug dealer.

837
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,840
Let's say he gets caught--

838
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,240
he's out of jail in three days.

839
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,160
And the cop?

840
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,280
They plant him,
play the bagpipes.

841
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,440
His wife and kids got to scrimpand save just to carry the nut

842
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,440
they had going--

843
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,320
bullshit.

844
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,000
I better go.

845
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:41,960
Oh, hey, uh--

846
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,480
Charlie, it's all right.

847
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:49,440
Before I say something
that might offend.

848
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,360
Before you say something?

849
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,720
Honey.

850
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,600
Thanks for the takeout.

851
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:05,840
Charlie, come on,
listen, you don't--

852
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:11,080
hey, Charlie, are
you always like this?

853
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,720
Like what?

854
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,920
A complete asshole, man.

855
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,360
Probably so.

856
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,120
I'll see you, shooter.

857
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,080
[music playing]

858
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,200
You do us this little favorand your made-- nice digs,

859
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,000
clean underwear, the works.

860
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,560
Fellas, it-- it
just ain't right.

861
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,080
Well right and wrong dependson what side of the fence

862
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,200
you're on, Wally.

863
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,600
But there are basic things.

864
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,600
We understand that, but
we're doing is right--

865
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,120
right in anybody's book.

866
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,440
This creep is a low lifemother fucking druggy who

867
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,240
we've busted too many times.[laughs]

868
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,840
He say's he's
trying to clean up.

869
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,200
ORLANSER: That's
pure bullshit, Wally.

870
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,640
You want another round?

871
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,640
Hey chief, bring my cousinanother round here, huh?

872
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,720
Look, Wally, we tried
to help this punk.

873
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,360
I don't know.

874
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,800
We're being nice.

875
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,800
Real nice, Wally.

876
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,360
Real nice isn't working here.

877
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,480
So let me put it
to you like this.

878
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,840
If you don't help us out--

879
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,240
[screams]

880
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,000
--we'll fucking kill you.

881
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,360
Now how's that?

882
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,440
Hey, buddy, it's OK.

883
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,640
Hey, hey, take it easy.

884
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,520
Huh?

885
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,640
It's all right, buddy.

886
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,160
[phone ringing]

887
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,080
Yeah?

888
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,000
SALLY [ON PHONE]: Charlie,it's-- it's Sally.

889
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,160
Can I talk to you?

890
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,640
I'm listening.

891
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,640
SALLY [ON PHONE]:
No, face to face.

892
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,280
I'll stop by the
bar tomorrow night.

893
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,680
SALLY [ON PHONE]: Now, Charlie.

894
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,680
Now?

895
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,560
SALLY [ON PHONE]: Please?

896
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,680
Where?

897
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,560
SALLY [ON PHONE]: Um--

898
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,000
Kip's Coffee shop.

899
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,400
I'll be there.

900
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,280
SALLY [ON PHONE]: OK.

901
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,400
You look like shit.

902
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:33,520
Well, you look about the same.

903
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,720
Yeah, we're a match set, baby.

904
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,520
I need a little something tohelp me get through the night.

905
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,880
So what are you
calling me for?

906
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,080
We stopped sharing the same bed.

907
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,840
Remember?

908
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,320
Well, you see, Sam--

909
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,240
Sam used to be my supplier.

910
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,640
You're full of shit.

911
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,600
And he's dead now, soyou got to take his place.

912
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,680
Sam never gave you no dope.

913
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:02,560
What?

914
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,960
You've been blind?

915
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,120
No fucking way.

916
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,040
Any fucking way,
he used to give me.

917
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,480
He's gone.

918
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,600
You sure as hell know whatyour partner was doing?

919
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,480
You bitch.

920
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,880
I need it, Charlie, now.

921
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,600
Fucking hustle me, Sally.

922
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,040
You're an asshole.

923
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,360
Charlie?

924
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,320
Conveniently deaf,
dumb, and blind--

925
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,160
is that it?

926
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,600
Sam was giving me the stuff.

927
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,320
It was his way of being nice.

928
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,040
You leave Sam out of this.

929
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,760
They want me to fingersome Innocent slob, Charlie.

930
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,880
What are you talking about?

931
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,520
Hey.

932
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,000
Charlie, you owe
me and we haven't

933
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,600
had a good screw in months.

934
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,000
What do you say?

935
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,280
[inaudible] I should
baby, that's what I say.

936
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,960
I'll clean up.

937
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,280
I'll clean up, I
promise, Charlie.

938
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,200
Please?

939
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,640
[crying]

940
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,160
Never say that
about Sam again.

941
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,480
You understand me?

942
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,840
Do you understand me?

943
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,240
Yeah, Charlie.

944
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,720
[crying]

945
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,960
[opera singing]

946
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,040
I know.

947
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:28,400
I wasn't too crazy
about her either.

948
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,200
- You looking at Burnside.- Who?

949
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,840
The passport you found
in Winch's hotel room.

950
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,720
Look, I told you, these
fucking drug dealers

951
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,600
got a zillion fake IDs.

952
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:36,720
Can I see it?

953
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,600
I forgot where I put it.

954
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,120
Let me ask you something.

955
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:44,000
How long before
you found Levinson?

956
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,120
Hour.

957
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,040
That long?

958
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:47,920
You sure?

959
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:48,840
What the fuck is this?

960
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:49,760
Yeah, I'm sure.

961
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,920
[music playing]

962
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,960
I want to check this
guy out on computer.

963
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,800
What did Sally Niece
tell you on the night

964
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,440
Sam Levinson was murdered?

965
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,960
She say anything about that?

966
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,760
Since when are youinterested in Sally Niece?

967
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,720
What did she tell you?

968
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,240
Read the report, shooter.

969
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,480
And don't you have
enough to keep

970
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,600
you busy with the Winch case?

971
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,160
That's Jerome Johnson, right?

972
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,160
Right?
- What?

973
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,080
Yeah.

974
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,080
Yeah.

975
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,560
[music playing]

976
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,800
Fuck.

977
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:16,840
Listen, what we're
going to have to do--

978
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,200
What's going on
in here, Vincent?

979
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,320
Gentlemen, would
you excuse me.

980
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,360
I'll get back to you right away.

981
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,480
Falon, what is your problem?

982
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,440
Who are those guys?

983
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:31,680
What's it to you?

984
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,120
And who in the fuck
is Harry Burnside?

985
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,640
This whole fucking thingis going south, anyway.

986
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,160
Harry Burnside was a cop.

987
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,440
What do you mean a cop?

988
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,600
I thought it best
that you know nothing

989
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:39,840
about this whole fucking thing.

990
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,120
What fucking thing?

991
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,640
It was an IA sting.

992
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,960
Some dirty cops were skimmingdrugs off their collars

993
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,320
and selling it back to dealers.

994
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,080
Burnside was IA.

995
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,160
No.

996
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,600
What do you mean, no?

997
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,040
Yes.

998
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,680
He was supposed to installhimself as a drug dealer

999
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,160
so he could put
pressure on those guys

1000
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,800
who were under investigation.

1001
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,400
And Sam Levinson was one ofthe cops under investigation.

1002
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,320
You fuck, you thought me andSam were into selling drugs?

1003
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,960
You were cleared months ago.

1004
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,600
How the hell do you think yougot the Winch investigation?

1005
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,760
Those guys are IA.

1006
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,440
You son of a bitch.

1007
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:12,520
Hey, go fuck yourself!

1008
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,600
Levinson was selling drugs.

1009
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,920
The kind that you find inlittle kids arms, dead.

1010
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,480
Only he got cold feetand he wanted to get out.

1011
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,160
What in the fuck
are you telling me?

1012
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,960
I am telling you
something simple.

1013
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,400
This fucking Burnside--
poor bastard--

1014
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,960
that night was going
to tell Levinson

1015
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:32,560
what the whole fucking thingwas about and he got dead.

1016
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,600
We thought we had this
whole thing set up.

1017
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,400
Burnside was supposed to putpressure on the bed cops,

1018
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,120
have them turn state's
evidence-- ah, shit,

1019
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,520
the whole fucking thing is gone.

1020
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,000
Bye, bye.

1021
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,160
Have a nice fucking day.

1022
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,040
Ah, shit!

1023
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,040
Get out.

1024
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,040
Relax, pal.

1025
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,040
Get the fuck out!

1026
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,040
Leave him alone.

1027
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,040
Let's go.

1028
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,520
I said, get the fuck out!

1029
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,000
[crying]

1030
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,480
[music playing]

1031
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:15,960
Ah.

1032
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,440
Ah.

1033
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,920
[laughs]

1034
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:26,920
Oh, yeah.

1035
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,360
You 're fine and dandy.

1036
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,520
What can I get you, pal?

1037
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,520
I'm Charlie
Falon's new partner.

1038
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,720
My condolences.

1039
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:47,040
Can I talk to
you for a minute?

1040
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,280
About what?

1041
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,160
The night Sam
Levinson was murdered.

1042
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,080
What can you tell me?

1043
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,200
Levinson leaves,
goes in the back alley.

1044
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,560
A little while later,
Falon goes back.

1045
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:58,240
How much later?

1046
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,560
A half hour maybe?

1047
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,600
Not longer-- say an hour?

1048
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,960
No, no, no.

1049
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:04,280
Couldn't have been that
long-- half hour tops.

1050
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,480
Me and Sally locked up.

1051
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:07,640
I asked if she
wanted a ride home.

1052
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,880
She says, no.

1053
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,320
She only lives a few
blocks from here.

1054
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,440
I say good night to her.

1055
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,720
I got in my car and I went home.

1056
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,160
Anything else?

1057
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,800
That's it.

1058
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:16,960
Thanks.

1059
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,480
Uh-- do me a favor, will you?

1060
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:19,840
Sure.

1061
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,720
Take care of Charlie.

1062
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,600
I'm know he's a pain in the ass,but deep down, he's a good guy.

1063
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,000
You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

1064
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,120
I know what you mean.

1065
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,040
I'll try.

1066
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:29,920
Thanks.

1067
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,560
Now, this has to be
done by the book, Wally.

1068
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:53,640
You understand?

1069
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,600
Huh?

1070
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:55,480
Yeah, sure.

1071
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,400
Right.

1072
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,760
Good.

1073
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,360
Now, you know the guy
from the Cherry Lounge?

1074
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,840
You even spoke with him onoccasion, about drugs, right?

1075
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:02,760
OK.

1076
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:03,640
All right?

1077
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,560
Yeah.

1078
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,320
Good boy.

1079
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,480
See what a good boy?

1080
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,040
Now you led us to this addressbecause you saw the whole thing

1081
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,680
the other night.

1082
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,400
Yeah, whatever you guys say.

1083
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,680
You saw everything.

1084
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,800
OK?

1085
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,480
When this is over,
all you gotta do

1086
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,120
is sign a statement saying thatyou saw this guy kill Levinson.

1087
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,640
All right?

1088
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:24,200
HALLOWAY: You understand, Wally?

1089
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,760
I said, you understand?

1090
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,080
Yeah, sure.

1091
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:32,040
You move while we're
gone, you're dead.

1092
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,960
Very dead.

1093
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,720
HALLOWAY: Let's go.

1094
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,720
[music playing]

1095
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:12,360
Here you go, darling.

1096
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,640
Oh, thank you.

1097
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:14,640
Will you go check on
your brother for me?

1098
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,600
Mm.
OK.

1099
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,040
No problem.
- Ah.

1100
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,000
Oops, excuse me.

1101
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,160
Hey!

1102
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,040
Yo, what the hell
is going on, man?

1103
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,560
Ah, ah, ah.

1104
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,480
Hello, Jerome.

1105
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,040
How's it been?

1106
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,160
Still trying to keep thatnose of yours clean, Jerome.

1107
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,280
How dare you!

1108
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,200
You still on
probation, Jerome?

1109
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:31,360
Man, no.

1110
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:32,640
I finished with
that two weeks ago.

1111
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,080
Now, what-- what--
- Still pushing drugs?

1112
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,360
What do you men want?

1113
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,640
You used to give
us some shit, Jerome.

1114
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,520
Hey, man, I neverbothered you two, all right?

1115
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,520
JEROME'S MOTHER: Well, you menhave no right to come in here

1116
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:43,880
and talk this way to him.

1117
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,160
You've always been a
big headache, Jerome.

1118
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,480
You made me ruin a good
pair of floor shines

1119
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,960
chasing your ass
through that garbage

1120
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,320
pile over on Grant Street.

1121
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:51,640
Well, you have no right
to treat us like this.

1122
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,560
Now get out!

1123
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:53,880
Get out?

1124
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
But we have a warrant
for your arrest, Jerome.

1125
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,000
ORLANSER: In connection withthe murder of Police Detective

1126
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,880
Samuel Levinson.- What you talking about?

1127
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,360
I didn't kill nobody.
Mom, I'm telling you--

1128
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,240
I know you didn't.

1129
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,920
Hey!

1130
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,480
Everything will be clearedup once we get you downtown.

1131
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,360
Yeah, well this isn't right.And I'm going to call somebody.

1132
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,520
I ain't going downtown.

1133
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:10,880
Now get your asses
out of my house!

1134
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,880
Well, I'm sorry,
ma'am, but, uh--

1135
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:13,800
Yeah we'll see about that.

1136
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,680
We're just doing our job.

1137
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,680
[gunshots]

1138
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,160
Oh, Jesus.

1139
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,400
[baby crying]

1140
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,400
What the fuck is
wrong with you all?

1141
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,640
Oh, my little baby!

1142
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:23,520
Oh!

1143
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:24,920
[crying]

1144
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,120
JEROME'S MOTHER:
My baby's in there.

1145
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,480
Now, you had
better pay attention.

1146
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,880
Shh.
Calm down.

1147
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
It's OK.

1148
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:31,960
- My baby's in there.
- It's OK.

1149
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:32,920
It's all right.

1150
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,400
Now calm down.
All right.

1151
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:35,960
Look, I don't know
what's going on, mom,

1152
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,520
but I'm-- when I get
to where I'm going,

1153
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:38,760
I'm going to call you.
- OK.

1154
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,880
I'm going to go to you, OK?

1155
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:40,960
You happy?

1156
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:42,280
I'm going.

1157
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,720
All right now, when
I get back, I'm going

1158
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,000
to let you know something.I'm going to call you.

1159
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,280
Just take care of
the baby, all right?

1160
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,200
HALLOWAY: Jerome?

1161
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,600
What?

1162
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,840
You want to throw
some clothes in a bag?

1163
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,440
You know, you all
you got a lot of nerve

1164
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:55,680
coming to my mother's
house like this.

1165
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,160
[gunshots]

1166
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,600
[baby crying]

1167
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,400
ORLANSER: Hey.

1168
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,200
Hey , little guy.

1169
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:22,440
Hey, hey, you're not goingto tell anybody, are you?

1170
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,920
Huh?

1171
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:25,520
Huh?

1172
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:30,360
Because, you know, if youdo, that wouldn't be so good.

1173
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,680
You know what I mean?

1174
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,600
Huh?

1175
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:34,480
You know what I mean?

1176
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:42,840
Hey, this kid can't even talk.

1177
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,640
Jesus christ, will
you knock it off?

1178
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,400
Do you want to play with this?

1179
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,720
HALLOWAY: Hi, this is Halloway.

1180
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:09,880
Yeah, I got a 187 at 1310 Allen.

1181
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,800
Yeah, look, we're
also going to need

1182
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,280
somebody from Child Welfare.

1183
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,160
MURROW: Told me
you'd probably be

1184
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:47,080
here around this time of day.

1185
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:51,400
Computer couldn't
tell me jack shit.

1186
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:56,280
Tell me something, Murrow,why did you want to be a cop?

1187
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,840
I don't know.

1188
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,480
I guess, maybe, because mydad always wanted to be one.

1189
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,680
He could have been one.

1190
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,440
That's what he always
kept telling us,

1191
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:09,360
and ended up selling
life insurance instead.

1192
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,480
Hated himself for that.

1193
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,760
The good guys and the bad guys.

1194
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:16,760
Nice and simple, huh?

1195
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,120
Just the way you like it, no?

1196
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:21,920
Fuck, that's the way
we'd all like it to be.

1197
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:25,040
Bad guys got to pay the
piper, sooner or later.

1198
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:26,960
Now, what's that mean?

1199
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,920
You want the guy who
killed Winch, don't you?

1200
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,080
Don't you?

1201
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,960
You're going
about it all wrong.

1202
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,600
Get your gut to lead
where you want to go.

1203
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,320
Fuck this technical shit.

1204
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,200
A cop should keep hisfeelings out of his work.

1205
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:40,200
You do that and you're dead.

1206
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,360
Let's get out of here.

1207
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,400
Let's get some coffee.

1208
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,760
Charlie?

1209
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:57,160
You know, I used to
think a lot about God.

1210
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,480
God?

1211
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:03,920
I was an alter boy,right there in that church.

1212
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:07,680
I thought I knew all there
was to know about God.

1213
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,160
Not anymore.

1214
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,520
[music playing]

1215
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:30,400
That's beautiful.

1216
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:33,360
Yeah.

1217
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:34,400
Let's go light a candle.

1218
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,840
First you got to
look at the motives.

1219
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,160
Motives-- drugs, obviously.

1220
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:50,240
Look at all the possibilities.

1221
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:53,640
Motive, personality
are usually connected.

1222
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,920
A dead person's personality--

1223
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,200
live by the sword, et cetera--

1224
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:02,040
those are possible motives.

1225
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:04,000
Jealousy, revenge.

1226
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:05,400
Your standard fare.

1227
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,120
Let's run it down.

1228
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:19,840
The position of the weltson Winch's face and neck

1229
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:22,840
indicate he was caughtoff guard or by surprise.

1230
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,280
He didn't expect it.

1231
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,920
He wasn't gotten frombehind, which means if he

1232
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,840
didn't anticipate the beating--

1233
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,480
He knew the killer.

1234
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,920
Maybe.

1235
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,880
Maybe even trusted the killer.

1236
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,200
Or at least thought thekiller wasn't a murderer.

1237
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:39,920
In 90% of all homicides,the victim and the killer

1238
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,160
know each other.

1239
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,280
They usually have
something in common.

1240
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,520
Yeah, something in common.

1241
01:09:49,480 --> 01:10:00,440
Remember, physical stuff-- moreimportant than any theories.

1242
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,480
MURROW: You wanted
to see us, Captain?

1243
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,360
Yeah, I wanted you andyour partner to hear this.

1244
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,960
Go ahead.

1245
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,080
HALLOWAY: Yeah, anyway, wesuspected this Jerome Johnson

1246
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,680
from the onset.

1247
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,120
He knew Sam from a few yearsback when he was a teenager.

1248
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:23,360
What we needed and got
was an eyewitness--

1249
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,480
Wally Pental.

1250
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,800
ORLANSER: So we figuredthat the, uh-- same person

1251
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:31,480
or persons hit the warehouse,
tied that, the dealers

1252
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,520
there to Jerome Johnson.

1253
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,600
Johnson was in the process ofbuilding up a small clientele--

1254
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,320
big mistake.

1255
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,880
He hit them.

1256
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,040
Their friends got
pissed and hit him.

1257
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,320
So now, they're even.

1258
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,520
And good riddance
to bad rubbish.

1259
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:49,880
Yeah.

1260
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,160
Well, we knew that
Wally knew Johnson,

1261
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:57,040
so after a little prodding,Wally gave us what we needed.

1262
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,720
Shit, it turns out he sawthe whole thing himself.

1263
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,160
Eye witness number one.

1264
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,120
Jesus, and that two-year-oldkid seen all this?

1265
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,560
Money and drugs all
over the apartment

1266
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,040
from the warehouse deal.

1267
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:06,920
Odd.

1268
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:07,840
What's odd?

1269
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,080
CHARLIE: Nothing.

1270
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,920
Not our case.

1271
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:14,640
Now, how fast did
you guys get there?

1272
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:15,600
I don't know.

1273
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,840
Couldn't have been too long.

1274
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,680
Something wrong, shooter?

1275
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,760
MURROW: I'm just asking.

1276
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,560
Come on.
We got work to do.

1277
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,200
You want to leave
them behind, shooter?

1278
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:32,000
Sure.

1279
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,800
Here you go, Captain.

1280
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,680
There's something not right.

1281
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,600
I'm listening.

1282
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:42,560
It's just a feeling I have.

1283
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,480
Some things don't fit.

1284
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:47,680
Oh, you're listening toyour feelings today, are you?

1285
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,920
Johnson had to know the badguys were gunning for him.

1286
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,200
Yeah?

1287
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,160
Why put his family
in the line of fire?

1288
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,080
Why not empty his weapon
through the damn door?

1289
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,200
We know he had a full clip.

1290
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:59,440
Maybe the guy is
scared shitless?

1291
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:01,040
Why, if he's so
scared shitless,

1292
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,800
hang back and wait until
they bang down the door?

1293
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:04,840
Protect his family.

1294
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,040
Protect his family-- bullshit.

1295
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,320
Falon, come on.

1296
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,680
Does he even get a
clean shot off at them?

1297
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,480
- Does he?
- No.

1298
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,840
With 10 rounds left,
he just turns his back

1299
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,080
and heads for the door?

1300
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,320
Not a very brave
thing to do, was it?

1301
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,160
You know, I don't like
coincidences, Falon.

1302
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,200
You?

1303
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,800
Depends.

1304
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,800
Halloway and Orlanser
get there minutes after

1305
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,400
it happened-- coincidence?

1306
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:29,320
Life's full of them, kid.

1307
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,480
Well, it's too neatly wrapped.

1308
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:31,400
All right?

1309
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:32,400
It's-- it's too tight.

1310
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,360
Falon--

1311
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,680
Yeah.

1312
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,480
You dealt with Winch
as much as Levinson?

1313
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,520
It was really Sam's contact.

1314
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,080
But you knew him, right?

1315
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,160
Yeah, I knew him.

How about Halloway

1334

It came to me in Delgoti'soffice, the motive.

You find the motive,
you find the killer.

your best friend.
