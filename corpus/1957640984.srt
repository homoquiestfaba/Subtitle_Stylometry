1
00:00:01,445 --> 00:00:06,833
(gentle music) (hooves clattering)

2
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,742
- Hannah, the moon is so bright tonight.

3
00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:50,280
- [Both] And this cold forest feels as far from you

4
00:00:50,315 --> 00:00:52,886
- [Man] As I could be but knowing you'll be seeing

5
00:00:52,922 --> 00:00:55,355
the same moon in just a few hours,

6
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,023
the world seems small again.

7
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,699
I have some incredible news,

8
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:02,410
by the time you receive this I'll be somewhere mid Atlantic

9
00:01:02,444 --> 00:01:05,121
steaming towards you at 20 knots.

10
00:01:05,156 --> 00:01:07,692
I wanna marry you the minute I'm home.

11
00:01:07,728 --> 00:01:11,585
- [Both] Until then I'm jealous of the moon.

12
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,733
- Mary! Mary!

13
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:18,294
He's coming home!

14
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,754
Hank's coming home!

15
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,395
(gentle music)

16
00:01:38,522 --> 00:01:40,573
Mom those are your good pearls.

17
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,276
- Oh they're perfect for the bodice.

18
00:01:42,312 --> 00:01:43,180
Now one more time,

19
00:01:43,215 --> 00:01:44,988
- We've already done this.

20
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,482
- Measure twice, cut once.

21
00:01:46,516 --> 00:01:49,297
(gentle music)

22
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:38,340
Okay, now don't open them until I tell you.

23
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:44,838
Woody.

24
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:48,349
- What do you think Daddy?

25
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:50,469
- Excuse me.

26
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:53,562
- Daddy?

27
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:55,683
- Let him go, he'll be fine.

28
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:58,429
(engine rumbles)

29
00:02:59,576 --> 00:03:00,966
- Oh my God it's Hank.

30
00:03:06,597 --> 00:03:07,465
Hank!

31
00:03:09,864 --> 00:03:11,636
- Captain Jeffries ma'am.

32
00:03:11,671 --> 00:03:13,617
Are you Hannah Pinkum?

33
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:20,221
- Mary get your father.

34
00:03:20,257 --> 00:03:23,211
(dramatic music)

35
00:03:30,822 --> 00:03:35,479
(tearing) (crying)

36
00:03:40,658 --> 00:03:43,578
(dramatic music)

37
00:03:55,812 --> 00:03:58,002
- I wanna read something that I wrote for Hank.

38
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,393
- [Mary] Okay.

39
00:04:03,772 --> 00:04:07,004
- Before you I never dreamed that stars could rise

40
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,889
under my feet, that eyes could sing,

41
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:14,964
that we could go quietly about flinging open windows

42
00:04:14,998 --> 00:04:17,084
though death itself had locked the door.

43
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:24,452
One day may this dress be worn by someone

44
00:04:24,486 --> 00:04:27,441
who's found the kind of love where nothing is impossible.

45
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:30,083
(gentle music)

46
00:04:40,997 --> 00:04:43,429
(clattering)

47
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,948
- Iris, oh there's my girl.

48
00:04:47,982 --> 00:04:50,034
Hello, hi gorgeous.

49
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:52,431
Come on, help me get this all set up okay?

50
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:55,977
Want some water?

51
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:58,723
Travis, yes Travis is coming.

52
00:05:00,913 --> 00:05:02,476
Come on we don't have much time.

53
00:05:04,145 --> 00:05:08,732
Okay Iris no wagging, no slurping, and no being a dog.

54
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:13,599
Oh Iris, how do I look?

55
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:15,997
(footsteps)

56
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:21,211
- Where is she?

57
00:05:21,245 --> 00:05:23,192
Where is my girl?

58
00:05:23,227 --> 00:05:26,042
Hey sweetheart, come here.

59
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:31,012
You got fat, you got bathed.

60
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:32,472
You didn't miss me at all.

61
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:33,376
Hey you.

62
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,314
- Hey.

63
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:36,643
Hi.

64
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:39,875
- The place looks incredible.

65
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,092
- You know me, I'm a fixer.

66
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:46,340
- Zoey, Zoey do I wish you had been with me in New York.

67
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,294
You know me and organization.

68
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:53,048
You are my right hand, my left brain,

69
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,177
my north pole and my south paw.

70
00:05:57,844 --> 00:06:00,729
- So besides being miserable without me

71
00:06:00,764 --> 00:06:03,892
did you manage to have fun and get famous?

72
00:06:03,926 --> 00:06:06,568
- Got a show at the Bierman Gallery this June

73
00:06:06,603 --> 00:06:10,392
and photographs by Travis Cleveland at the Sinclair Studio

74
00:06:10,426 --> 00:06:11,643
in September.

75
00:06:12,928 --> 00:06:13,554
- Are you serious?

76
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:14,736
- Yeah!

77
00:06:14,771 --> 00:06:17,239
- So does this mean I should save your grocery lists

78
00:06:17,273 --> 00:06:18,733
and make you sign my t-shirts?

79
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:21,376
- Zoey you're not gonna believe this,

80
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:24,676
I met the woman of my dreams.

81
00:06:27,491 --> 00:06:29,890
You never thought I'd get married did ya?

82
00:06:29,925 --> 00:06:30,933
- No, no I did.

83
00:06:30,968 --> 00:06:32,949
- [Travis] Well you're right.

84
00:06:32,984 --> 00:06:35,764
It was fate, I met her at the Wheeler opening,

85
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:36,738
she's one of his models.

86
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:37,815
- A model.

87
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:39,900
- Yeah, yeah but I really think you'll like her.

88
00:06:39,935 --> 00:06:41,603
She's smart and she's sensitive

89
00:06:41,637 --> 00:06:42,576
and funny and--

90
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,453
- And beautiful.

91
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,392
- I'm a goner.

92
00:06:46,747 --> 00:06:49,875
Oh hey would you get us a couple cappuccinos.

93
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,439
Cass should be here any minute.

94
00:06:51,474 --> 00:06:54,012
And Cass said that she likes hers with extra foam.

95
00:06:55,575 --> 00:06:57,349
(tapping)

96
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,183
- Hey.

97
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,364
- [Vendor] Hey.

98
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,284
- One with sugar, one without and one with extra foam.

99
00:07:02,318 --> 00:07:03,327
- [Vendor] You got it.

100
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:04,335
- And ground glass.

101
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:12,468
(door bangs)

102
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:18,758
- Red hot cappuccinos for the red hot lovers.

103
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:21,713
- Cass come meet Zoey.

104
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:25,224
Zoey I want you to meet my bride to be.

105
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:26,371
Thanks.

106
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:27,275
- Hi.

107
00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:28,178
- Hi.

108
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:29,012
(dog barks)

109
00:07:29,046 --> 00:07:29,638
- Iris, Iris.

110
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:30,576
What's gotten into you.

111
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,522
- Cass I recognize you from magazines.

112
00:07:32,556 --> 00:07:33,739
- Oh which magazine?

113
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:38,708
- Ah let's see maybe Biker Mama's or Roughage and You.

114
00:07:38,744 --> 00:07:40,447
(laughs)

115
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:43,435
- She's funny Travis, no wonder you like her.

116
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:46,877
- I'm nothing without Zoey, I'm nuts and she's the bolts.

117
00:07:46,912 --> 00:07:48,024
(growls)

118
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:50,040
Iris stop that!

119
00:07:50,074 --> 00:07:51,187
- Is that your dog Zoey.

120
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,091
- No she's mine.

121
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:54,453
Whenever I'm out of town like this she,

122
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:57,305
you know, wants my undivided attention.

123
00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:58,590
- Well who can blame her?

124
00:08:00,328 --> 00:08:01,197
(growls) (barks)

125
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:02,205
- Iris stop!

126
00:08:03,873 --> 00:08:04,776
- Yikes.

127
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,460
So Zoey do you have a boyfriend?

128
00:08:08,496 --> 00:08:12,180
- Ah, yeah until recently.

129
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:14,787
- Oh well maybe you'll meet someone at our wedding.

130
00:08:14,821 --> 00:08:16,420
Wouldn't that be perfect?

131
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:21,529
Travis look, this was my absolute dream dress.

132
00:08:22,572 --> 00:08:24,553
And it costs an absolute fortune.

133
00:08:26,534 --> 00:08:28,342
- Yeah, it's interesting.

134
00:08:29,837 --> 00:08:30,948
What do you think Zoey?

135
00:08:36,788 --> 00:08:40,959
- It kinda looks like a futuristic nurse uniform.

136
00:08:40,993 --> 00:08:41,897
- Excuse me?

137
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:45,025
Do you realize who designed this dress?

138
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,034
Wilhelmina Pringle.

139
00:08:48,224 --> 00:08:51,212
- It'd be like us coveting a Hastleblaght Zoe.

140
00:08:51,248 --> 00:08:52,881
Hey we want the best right?

141
00:08:52,915 --> 00:08:55,905
- Well I obviously do, look who I fell in love with.

142
00:08:57,816 --> 00:08:59,657
(barks)

143
00:08:59,693 --> 00:09:00,596
- I'm sorry.

144
00:09:03,828 --> 00:09:04,732
- Yikes.

145
00:09:08,243 --> 00:09:09,598
Goodnight.

146
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,163
- Zoey, come here.

147
00:09:13,491 --> 00:09:14,465
What do you think?

148
00:09:20,165 --> 00:09:23,293
- Wow, I'm so impressed.

149
00:09:24,787 --> 00:09:27,186
- I don't believe my ears.

150
00:09:27,221 --> 00:09:29,340
- Don't flatter yourself.

151
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:31,495
The lighting could be improved.

152
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,476
You should have taken your assistant.

153
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:36,466
- Oh hey, I wanna show you.

154
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,490
Look, this is when I met Cass.

155
00:09:39,524 --> 00:09:43,904
This very shot was my first glimpse of her.

156
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,283
I wanted to capture the actual subjects

157
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:52,141
of Wheeler's posed shots but quickly to--

158
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:54,887
- Have them as unposed as possible.

159
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:57,563
Expose the real self observing the social self.

160
00:09:59,336 --> 00:10:01,352
- You know me too well.

161
00:10:01,387 --> 00:10:06,323
- Well I know this much, I know that love is blind

162
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:08,824
and one of us needs a seeing eye dog.

163
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,562
- Am I that far gone?

164
00:10:10,597 --> 00:10:12,717
(chuckling)

165
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:15,741
- Travis there's something I have to tell you.

166
00:10:15,775 --> 00:10:17,305
- Look is it about Cass?

167
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,538
Because I know it seems shallow that I picked a beautiful

168
00:10:20,572 --> 00:10:22,623
model, it seems corny

169
00:10:22,658 --> 00:10:25,264
but she's beautiful on the inside too.

170
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,654
- You're right.

171
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:27,801
- You mean you can see that?

172
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:30,305
- No, you're right it sounds corny.

173
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:34,440
- Stop, she she has a degree in social work,

174
00:10:34,475 --> 00:10:36,109
she took care of her grandmother when she was dying

175
00:10:36,143 --> 00:10:37,776
of cancer, she has a good heart.

176
00:10:38,993 --> 00:10:42,261
- All I need to know is that you love her.

177
00:10:42,296 --> 00:10:44,103
- But I want you to like her Zoey.

178
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,570
- Maybe I will in time.

179
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,151
- What did you want to ask me?

180
00:10:50,185 --> 00:10:51,436
(phone ringing)

181
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:52,341
Sorry.

182
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:56,823
Hello, Cleveland Studios.

183
00:10:58,006 --> 00:10:59,257
Oh hey honey we're just...

184
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,586
Whoa, whoa, whao, slow down.

185
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:05,339
Cass do they know that that's not my specialty?

186
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,085
Uh huh.

187
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:09,579
Let me--

188
00:11:09,614 --> 00:11:11,283
(phone clatters)

189
00:11:11,318 --> 00:11:14,342
The photographer from Cass's shoot has pneumonia.

190
00:11:14,377 --> 00:11:16,670
(chatting)

191
00:11:21,466 --> 00:11:22,683
- Cut, cut.

192
00:11:22,718 --> 00:11:24,490
- What sweet heart, tell us what?

193
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:25,707
- This is not working.

194
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:27,341
The wind, the smoke, my eyes are tearing,

195
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:29,252
my makeup's running and there's a bee somewhere

196
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:30,400
and I'm allergic to bees.

197
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:32,276
- Maybe we should call in the swat team.

198
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:33,492
- Zoey, turn the fan off.

199
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:34,430
- Yup.

200
00:11:36,204 --> 00:11:37,073
(clatters)

201
00:11:37,107 --> 00:11:38,567
- Whoa, whoa.

202
00:11:38,601 --> 00:11:40,861
What is this the third mistake in the last three minutes?

203
00:11:40,895 --> 00:11:42,564
Who are you, the elephant child?

204
00:11:42,598 --> 00:11:45,901
- Hey she happens to be the best assistant around.

205
00:11:45,935 --> 00:11:48,056
Armond, if you have a problem talk to me.

206
00:11:56,536 --> 00:11:59,004
Don't worry about them we're doing great, okay?

207
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,028
- This is unreal here, doesn't it bother you?

208
00:12:02,063 --> 00:12:03,036
- Hello?

209
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:05,503
We're ready, does anyone care, can we shoot?

210
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:10,370
- [Zoey] Hey Travis.

211
00:12:10,405 --> 00:12:12,177
- Hey good morning, how'd those prints turn out?

212
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:13,706
Armond needs them by three.

213
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:16,244
- Well the locomotive looks great.

214
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,380
Oh something big came for you, I think it's from your aunt.

215
00:12:20,414 --> 00:12:23,577
- Oh cool, could you open it for me while I check these out?

216
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:24,515
Elephant child.

217
00:12:43,354 --> 00:12:45,439
Hey don't you want to hear this?

218
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:46,864
- Are you kidding of course I do,

219
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,402
I was just pretending to respect your privacy.

220
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:51,314
- Oh look.

221
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,492
My darling nephew,

222
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,385
I was so happy to hear you found your soul mate

223
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,340
and I can't wait to meet her.

224
00:13:03,374 --> 00:13:05,286
- I remember how fascinated you were

225
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:07,962
with the story of this dress.

226
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:10,568
It wasn't my destiny to wear it

227
00:13:10,603 --> 00:13:13,210
but perhaps it could be your brides.

228
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:16,582
I past the dress onto you now,

229
00:13:16,616 --> 00:13:19,501
in hopes that she will love it as much as I did.

230
00:13:19,536 --> 00:13:22,282
(gentle music)

231
00:13:30,206 --> 00:13:34,586
- This is the most beautiful wedding dress I have ever seen.

232
00:13:35,907 --> 00:13:37,504
- Well I'm sure it's a beautiful dress

233
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,139
but can't I just think about it?

234
00:13:39,174 --> 00:13:40,807
My hearts so set on the Wilhelmina Pringle.

235
00:13:40,842 --> 00:13:43,831
- Yeah Cass, we can't afford that dress.

236
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:44,943
- Daddy says he'll get it for me.

237
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,496
- Look let's just wait until you see aunt Hannah's.

238
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,539
I think that you're gonna love it

239
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:53,007
and if you don't then I totally understand.

240
00:13:54,988 --> 00:13:55,857
- Okay.

241
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:56,761
- Yeah?

242
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:57,490
- Mmhmm.

243
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:03,678
- So Armond didn't I tell you that he was a genius?

244
00:14:03,712 --> 00:14:04,755
- Obviously.

245
00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:09,656
I can't use these.

246
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,020
They're far to, well they're to real.

247
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,955
Women don't buy the cloth, they buy the image.

248
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:20,743
The shot has to say fun, sex, danger,

249
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:22,377
catch me, play with me.

250
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:25,922
These say stiff girl standing on a train.

251
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,718
- Cass told me you wanted real.

252
00:14:30,753 --> 00:14:33,951
- Well Travis I didn't mean this real.

253
00:14:36,002 --> 00:14:38,156
- They let you look natural and ravishing.

254
00:14:38,192 --> 00:14:40,068
Isn't that anyone's fantasy?

255
00:14:40,103 --> 00:14:42,153
- Don't worry I'll get you another chance.

256
00:14:42,188 --> 00:14:43,821
Armond's not the only coordinator in the business.

257
00:14:43,856 --> 00:14:45,733
- It's not my thing Cass.

258
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:47,298
I'm happier doing the work I do.

259
00:14:47,332 --> 00:14:49,001
- Yeah but it's limiting financially.

260
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:51,746
I mean, why not broaden your options?

261
00:14:52,824 --> 00:14:54,179
- I make a fine living.

262
00:14:57,273 --> 00:15:00,991
- Travis, oh my God, I'm so sorry I couldn't resist,

263
00:15:01,027 --> 00:15:02,520
please forgive me.

264
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:05,198
- Nah it's okay Zoey, really it's okay.

265
00:15:05,232 --> 00:15:08,951
Wow you look, you really look,

266
00:15:10,063 --> 00:15:12,288
uh that dress, that dress is amazing.

267
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:15,033
- Yes it is, isn't it?

268
00:15:16,493 --> 00:15:21,567
I see what you meant Travis it's totally one of a kind.

269
00:15:22,818 --> 00:15:25,738
- Travis I'm so embarrassed I had no right.

270
00:15:25,774 --> 00:15:27,545
- Well I can't wait to try it on.

271
00:15:27,581 --> 00:15:29,075
How about right now?

272
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,013
- Why not?

273
00:15:31,126 --> 00:15:31,995
I'll just...

274
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,316
Iris let's go for a walk.

275
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,348
(barks)

276
00:15:38,598 --> 00:15:41,379
- So how long have you been in love with him?

277
00:15:41,414 --> 00:15:43,186
- I can't remember when I wasn't.

278
00:15:45,793 --> 00:15:46,940
I've written him a goodbye letter.

279
00:15:46,975 --> 00:15:49,339
Could you give it to him for me?

280
00:15:49,374 --> 00:15:50,139
- You're leaving?

281
00:15:50,173 --> 00:15:51,841
- Tomorrow morning.

282
00:15:51,876 --> 00:15:52,884
- Oh.

283
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,594
Well I'll have to hire him a male assistant.

284
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,020
Any woman would fall in love with him.

285
00:15:58,341 --> 00:16:01,017
- He gets more amazing the longer you've known him.

286
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,647
- God this looks like a lampshade in a whorehouse.

287
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:11,271
- Cass, you have no idea how much this dress means to Travis

288
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:14,399
and his family, pretend to like it.

289
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:15,164
It's crucial.

290
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:17,839
- So why are you helping me out?

291
00:16:19,821 --> 00:16:22,149
- All the years I've known him,

292
00:16:22,184 --> 00:16:23,817
he's never been like this.

293
00:16:27,258 --> 00:16:28,301
He really loves you.

294
00:16:30,213 --> 00:16:31,117
Be good to him.

295
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:39,666
(door thuds)

296
00:16:56,142 --> 00:16:58,366
(door creaks)

297
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:00,486
- Hey, oh I missed you in the dress.

298
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,884
- I'm so late to my parents, it's already three.

299
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,517
I loved it though.

300
00:17:04,553 --> 00:17:05,908
- Okay, good, well I'll bring it with me

301
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:07,125
so they can see it too.

302
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,064
Where's Zoey?

303
00:17:10,288 --> 00:17:15,500
- Ah, honey, I hate to tell you on the run like this,

304
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,741
but she said to tell you that she quit.

305
00:17:19,776 --> 00:17:20,680
She just left.

306
00:17:22,904 --> 00:17:23,842
- Are you serious?

307
00:17:26,102 --> 00:17:27,006
Did she say why?

308
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:30,169
- Nothing, she was totally embarrassed.

309
00:17:30,203 --> 00:17:33,263
Maybe she just realized it was a dead end job.

310
00:17:33,297 --> 00:17:36,217
Anyway she said to tell you she's sorry.

311
00:17:36,251 --> 00:17:38,510
Travis forgive me, I have to go.

312
00:17:38,544 --> 00:17:40,109
- Yeah go, go.

313
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:42,195
I'll see you at five.

314
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:43,098
- Okay.

315
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:44,036
- Bye.

316
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,833
(door thuds)

317
00:17:51,162 --> 00:17:54,081
(engine rumbles)

318
00:18:01,554 --> 00:18:04,543
(door bell rings)

319
00:18:06,523 --> 00:18:07,706
- [Woman] I think it looks good.

320
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,853
- [Woman] Yeah I think it's right.

321
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:09,930
- [Woman] Yeah.

322
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:12,815
- Travis is here with his aunt's wedding dress.

323
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,526
- Mom you've got to stall him.

324
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,091
- I'll introduce him to grandma.

325
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:21,678
- We didn't think she'd ever find Mr. Right.

326
00:18:21,713 --> 00:18:22,616
She's too picky.

327
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:25,189
- Well I'm glad she picked me.

328
00:18:25,224 --> 00:18:26,231
(chuckles)

329
00:18:26,267 --> 00:18:28,630
- I married the first man who winked at me.

330
00:18:28,664 --> 00:18:31,444
Just think I might've married some nitwit

331
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,801
with dust in his eyes.

332
00:18:32,835 --> 00:18:33,704
(laughing)

333
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:37,805
But fate was kind, I got me a plumb.

334
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:42,011
But, he's gone now.

335
00:18:43,297 --> 00:18:45,870
I lost Mr. Hotchkiss to cancer two years ago.

336
00:18:45,904 --> 00:18:48,406
- Yeah Cass told me how close you and she became

337
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:51,118
when she nursed you through your illness.

338
00:18:52,438 --> 00:18:55,393
- I've been in perfect health all of my life.

339
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:57,860
- Oh I'm sorry maybe ah, maybe she was talking about

340
00:18:57,895 --> 00:18:59,181
her other grandmother.

341
00:19:00,536 --> 00:19:03,421
- She died before Cass was born.

342
00:19:03,456 --> 00:19:06,168
- Cass said this was when she was getting her degree

343
00:19:06,202 --> 00:19:08,079
in social work at UCLA.

344
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:10,616
- Wouldn't that be something if they gave degrees

345
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:12,215
in socializing?

346
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,204
- But she did go to UCLA didn't she?

347
00:19:16,177 --> 00:19:18,610
- Oh Travis, forgive me

348
00:19:18,644 --> 00:19:23,094
but these are things you need to discuss with your bride.

349
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,179
(doors clattering)

350
00:19:25,215 --> 00:19:25,944
- Travis.

351
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:31,158
- I think you owe me an explanation.

352
00:19:31,193 --> 00:19:32,896
- And why is that?

353
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,710
I don't tell you how to take your photographs do I?

354
00:19:35,746 --> 00:19:38,388
That's your territory and I respect that.

355
00:19:38,421 --> 00:19:40,577
- Yeah but this isn't just about a dress Cass.

356
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:42,106
This is about what we mean to each other,

357
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:43,948
this is about trust.

358
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:46,103
Why would you lie about UCLA?

359
00:19:46,138 --> 00:19:49,266
- I didn't lie, I took some extension classes.

360
00:19:49,301 --> 00:19:51,907
- Why would you tell me grandmother had cancer?

361
00:19:51,943 --> 00:19:53,889
- So it was a friend's grandmother?

362
00:19:54,931 --> 00:19:56,774
- And what was that with Armond?

363
00:19:56,808 --> 00:19:59,068
You sold me down the river without a second thought.

364
00:19:59,102 --> 00:20:01,639
- I got you that opportunity and you blew it.

365
00:20:04,142 --> 00:20:05,915
- And you never had any intention of wearing the dress

366
00:20:05,949 --> 00:20:07,096
did you?

367
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:10,120
- Well Travis, you're supposed to eat a wedding cake

368
00:20:10,155 --> 00:20:11,267
not wear it.

369
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,500
- Wow.

370
00:20:14,534 --> 00:20:15,890
- This is my wedding day

371
00:20:17,141 --> 00:20:19,504
and if I can't make my own fashion statement

372
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:21,069
on this day of all days,

373
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:23,293
then guess who's not being respected?

374
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:25,726
- You're absolutely right Cass

375
00:20:27,117 --> 00:20:29,618
and I don't think I can marry someone I don't respect.

376
00:20:29,653 --> 00:20:32,573
(dramatic music)

377
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,417
(jingles)

378
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:45,467
(dramatic music)

379
00:20:45,503 --> 00:20:47,935
(door bangs)

380
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,427
(clatters)

381
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:55,408
Iris, what's gotten into you?

382
00:20:55,442 --> 00:20:58,363
(dramatic music)

383
00:21:06,392 --> 00:21:08,165
- [Zoey Voiceover] How I've loved being your right hand,

384
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:12,126
your left brain, your north pole and your south paw.

385
00:21:12,162 --> 00:21:14,942
It's sad that even with all those directions

386
00:21:14,977 --> 00:21:17,271
I still couldn't find my way into your heart.

387
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,981
I'll always love you, Zoey.

388
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,647
(clattering)

389
00:21:29,575 --> 00:21:32,182
- [Phone] The number you have reached has been disconnected

390
00:21:32,216 --> 00:21:33,710
and there is no new number.

391
00:21:33,746 --> 00:21:34,857
(clatters)

392
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:37,811
(dramatic music)

393
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,403
(clicking)

394
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:54,704
(light hearted music)

395
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:03,359
- 1,600 hours of school, then I get a license

396
00:22:03,393 --> 00:22:04,644
and I can cut hair.

397
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,294
Like my uncle said a little hard work never killed anyone.

398
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:10,483
- Yeah but why take the chance.

399
00:22:10,517 --> 00:22:12,257
- Not one nickel Billy.

400
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,620
- Aw come on Lula I'm not here for money.

401
00:22:14,654 --> 00:22:15,523
- Of course not.

402
00:22:15,558 --> 00:22:17,018
Where would I get that idea?

403
00:22:17,052 --> 00:22:19,520
- Let me take you to lunch then.

404
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:20,562
- I'm on a diet.

405
00:22:20,598 --> 00:22:23,100
- Well okay, well marry me then.

406
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:25,082
Hey come on.

407
00:22:25,116 --> 00:22:27,167
- Oh sure so we can live in your mother's kitchen,

408
00:22:27,201 --> 00:22:29,843
sleep all day, scam all night.

409
00:22:29,878 --> 00:22:32,484
Oh and then we can have kids and you can grow up with them.

410
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,910
- Lula.

411
00:22:33,945 --> 00:22:36,621
- Marriage is work, responsibility,

412
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,123
something you know nothing about.

413
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:41,904
You treat marriage like it's silly

414
00:22:41,939 --> 00:22:43,990
and marriage is serious.

415
00:22:44,024 --> 00:22:46,700
- But I am serious Lula.

416
00:22:46,735 --> 00:22:49,724
I need you in a serious, serious way.

417
00:22:49,758 --> 00:22:51,740
- Then do three things for me Billy.

418
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:56,989
Get a car, a job and propose to me so sweet my knees quiver.

419
00:22:58,726 --> 00:23:01,750
- Well I think I have the first one covered.

420
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:11,031
- Billy, where did you get this?

421
00:23:12,143 --> 00:23:14,297
- That's not all I got Lula, look I...

422
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:17,982
I got a camera too.

423
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:20,414
- You know what you're gonna get?

424
00:23:20,449 --> 00:23:24,378
You're gonna get a rap sheet a mile long.

425
00:23:24,411 --> 00:23:26,324
You stole this whole rig didn't you?

426
00:23:27,644 --> 00:23:29,903
- Come on Lula all I wanna steal is your heart.

427
00:23:31,432 --> 00:23:35,986
- Prove to me you're responsible and then we'll talk.

428
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,323
(light hearted music)

429
00:23:43,562 --> 00:23:46,482
(engine rumbles)

430
00:23:49,853 --> 00:23:52,495
(vocalizing)

431
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,420
(engine rumbles)

432
00:24:14,461 --> 00:24:18,424
(tires squealing) (light hearted music)

433
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,344
(crying out)

434
00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:26,592
(tires squealing) (light hearted music)

435
00:24:31,007 --> 00:24:33,092
(bangs)

436
00:24:37,228 --> 00:24:38,236
- Hey! Hey you!

437
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,174
Hey! Hey!

438
00:24:40,252 --> 00:24:42,406
Hey, hey are you alright?

439
00:24:45,013 --> 00:24:45,951
Where the hell you going?

440
00:24:45,987 --> 00:24:47,933
What about your car...

441
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:52,138
(gentle music)

442
00:25:03,747 --> 00:25:06,527
(upbeat music)

443
00:25:12,123 --> 00:25:14,244
Oh Laura, Laura you work too hard.

444
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,912
- I don't what you're looking at that menu for

445
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:17,059
you know you're gonna have your regular.

446
00:25:17,094 --> 00:25:18,831
- I'm trying to turn over a new leaf here,

447
00:25:18,866 --> 00:25:22,030
do something different, give my life some new life.

448
00:25:22,064 --> 00:25:23,177
- Oh that would be nice.

449
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:26,235
- So, I'll have a coconut donut.

450
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,555
That's healthy right?

451
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,702
(laughing)

452
00:25:28,738 --> 00:25:30,440
Hey, how's Paul doing?

453
00:25:31,483 --> 00:25:33,291
- I hardly ever see him.

454
00:25:33,326 --> 00:25:34,611
When he's not at the hospital

455
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:36,697
he's at the library studying.

456
00:25:36,731 --> 00:25:38,643
- Well it's all gonna be worth it.

457
00:25:38,677 --> 00:25:41,041
I even got you an early wedding present.

458
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:44,101
- Art.

459
00:25:44,135 --> 00:25:46,151
- Anybody see a dress in there?

460
00:25:46,186 --> 00:25:47,575
- Yeah no, it's a wedding dress.

461
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,653
The camera I don't care about

462
00:25:48,688 --> 00:25:50,773
but the dress it's irreplaceable.

463
00:25:50,808 --> 00:25:52,650
- [Man] No, there's no dress in here.

464
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:53,589
- God.

465
00:25:53,623 --> 00:25:55,292
- [Man] I didn't see any dress in there.

466
00:25:55,327 --> 00:25:56,647
- Hey is there anything you guys could do?

467
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:57,655
Hey! Could you...

468
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,601
Could you put out an APB on it?

469
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:06,310
(dramatic music)

470
00:26:12,044 --> 00:26:13,469
- Oh my God.

471
00:26:13,504 --> 00:26:15,728
Art where did you get this?

472
00:26:15,764 --> 00:26:17,049
- It was a gift.

473
00:26:18,196 --> 00:26:20,595
- Somebody gave you a wedding dress?

474
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:21,811
- Exactly.

475
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,932
(gasps)

476
00:26:23,966 --> 00:26:25,530
Could use a good home huh?

477
00:26:25,565 --> 00:26:27,650
So, what do you think?

478
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:30,048
- I've never seen anything so beautiful.

479
00:26:31,438 --> 00:26:33,802
You'd need a country club or a fancy hotel

480
00:26:33,837 --> 00:26:35,124
for something like this.

481
00:26:35,158 --> 00:26:38,633
- All you need is what you got.

482
00:26:38,668 --> 00:26:40,372
Now let's see what Paul thinks.

483
00:26:43,465 --> 00:26:44,924
(phone clatters)

484
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,419
- I certainly hope it wasn't long distance.

485
00:26:46,453 --> 00:26:47,566
- Dr. Weineger.

486
00:26:47,601 --> 00:26:50,138
No, no, no I was just trying to call my future bride.

487
00:26:50,174 --> 00:26:54,066
We haven't seen each other since Sunday, I think.

488
00:26:54,101 --> 00:26:55,421
What day is it today?

489
00:26:55,455 --> 00:26:58,306
- Believe it or not, it was worse in my day.

490
00:26:58,341 --> 00:27:00,357
I remember my very first surgery.

491
00:27:00,392 --> 00:27:03,589
The procedure went perfectly but when it came time to sign

492
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:06,474
the report I couldn't even remember my own initials.

493
00:27:06,508 --> 00:27:07,481
So how's Laura?

494
00:27:07,517 --> 00:27:09,706
- Working too hard, sacrificing too much.

495
00:27:09,741 --> 00:27:11,688
You know she deserves a special wedding

496
00:27:11,722 --> 00:27:14,955
but I'm afraid it's gonna be a paper bag lunch

497
00:27:14,989 --> 00:27:17,075
and a crackerjack ring.

498
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:20,377
- Paul you are a billionaire where it counts.

499
00:27:20,411 --> 00:27:22,011
You invite me to the wedding.

500
00:27:31,603 --> 00:27:32,959
- [Laura] Don't come in here.

501
00:27:32,993 --> 00:27:34,350
- I need my bed.

502
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,512
- [Laura] Honey please get a second wind tonight.

503
00:27:37,546 --> 00:27:39,806
I had such a wonderful day.

504
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:41,057
- Good tips?

505
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,691
- [Laura] I phoned the electric company,

506
00:27:42,725 --> 00:27:43,942
we got an extension.

507
00:27:43,977 --> 00:27:47,800
- Yeah, well if your getting amorous in there, forget it.

508
00:27:59,027 --> 00:28:01,807
(gentle music)

509
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,272
- It's much to extravagant.

510
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,929
I mean we'd have to rent the Four Seasons to go with it but,

511
00:28:27,492 --> 00:28:28,639
isn't it beautiful?

512
00:28:29,787 --> 00:28:32,115
Art gave it to me can you believe it?

513
00:28:34,097 --> 00:28:35,973
It needs a little fixing but...

514
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:40,665
Look it even fits perfectly.

515
00:28:46,297 --> 00:28:48,243
May I have this dance?

516
00:28:49,945 --> 00:28:51,927
- I was wondering when this would happen.

517
00:28:54,707 --> 00:28:58,113
I am now officially hallucinating.

518
00:28:58,149 --> 00:29:00,929
(gentle music)

519
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,378
- I'll find a home for it today.

520
00:29:40,413 --> 00:29:41,768
- Now don't you dare.

521
00:29:42,671 --> 00:29:43,610
We're keeping it.

522
00:29:46,322 --> 00:29:47,399
- Gotta be practical.

523
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:51,013
- I'll never understand you.

524
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:53,933
- That's love sickness that's all.

525
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:56,367
And doctor,

526
00:29:58,834 --> 00:29:59,911
there ain't no cure.

527
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:08,184
(light hearted music)

528
00:30:29,489 --> 00:30:32,305
- 2,000, this is very short notice,

529
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,189
we'll need 1,000 in advance by tomorrow,

530
00:30:35,225 --> 00:30:37,796
cash, nonrefundable.

531
00:30:37,831 --> 00:30:38,735
- 2,000?

532
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:42,453
We're on a very tight budget.

533
00:30:42,488 --> 00:30:43,254
- Up to you.

534
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:46,624
Is a wedding something you put a price tag on?

535
00:30:49,405 --> 00:30:51,699
- I'll bring you the cash tomorrow.

536
00:30:51,734 --> 00:30:55,071
- I love Wednesdays!

537
00:30:55,106 --> 00:30:58,546
We're at home at the same time for two whole hours.

538
00:30:59,381 --> 00:31:00,980
Even when we're old and gray,

539
00:31:02,057 --> 00:31:04,247
let's celebrate Wednesdays okay?

540
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:06,194
- A world full of voluptuous cynical women

541
00:31:06,228 --> 00:31:08,070
and I fall for a skinny romantic.

542
00:31:09,112 --> 00:31:10,086
They're all pink.

543
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:12,901
You know that's not easy to accomplish,

544
00:31:12,936 --> 00:31:14,292
we should win something.

545
00:31:15,056 --> 00:31:17,037
My tuition was due last week.

546
00:31:17,072 --> 00:31:18,010
- We have it don't we?

547
00:31:18,046 --> 00:31:19,991
- No, we have $200 left.

548
00:31:20,026 --> 00:31:20,895
- What happened?

549
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:21,764
I made a deposit.

550
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:24,962
- Books, phone, rents, bus tokens.

551
00:31:24,997 --> 00:31:26,769
Plus your cruises to Bora Bora.

552
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:30,418
- What can we do?

553
00:31:32,087 --> 00:31:33,407
- Maybe I should put off school

554
00:31:33,442 --> 00:31:35,216
until we have some money set aside.

555
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,500
- Again?

556
00:31:36,536 --> 00:31:38,968
You've waited so long, this is your last year.

557
00:31:40,915 --> 00:31:42,167
Let's just postpone the wedding.

558
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:43,105
- No.

559
00:31:47,068 --> 00:31:50,092
Everyday in the hospital I see how fragile life is.

560
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:53,427
I refuse to postpone our dreams.

561
00:31:55,235 --> 00:31:58,155
(dramatic music)

562
00:32:09,693 --> 00:32:10,597
- Mmm, oh.

563
00:32:13,135 --> 00:32:14,490
You know repairs and dry cleaning alone are gonna

564
00:32:14,524 --> 00:32:16,228
cost me a small fortune.

565
00:32:16,264 --> 00:32:19,634
Then I've gotta tag it, mark and inventory it and sell it

566
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:21,095
fast before it turns yellow.

567
00:32:21,129 --> 00:32:22,623
Want some gum?

568
00:32:22,658 --> 00:32:24,500
- It's a very special dress.

569
00:32:24,535 --> 00:32:25,577
You don't see detail--

570
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:29,540
- Ss, honey I have got 750 very specials in here

571
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:32,391
and every one of them has some sort of story to tell.

572
00:32:34,268 --> 00:32:36,839
- How much do you think?

573
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:39,828
- 600, oh woof, do you know what?

574
00:32:39,863 --> 00:32:41,600
I am too soft hearted for this business.

575
00:32:41,635 --> 00:32:44,520
(dramatic music)

576
00:32:54,044 --> 00:32:57,485
(light hearted music)

577
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,548
- A grand.

578
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,225
- It's worth at least four, it's solid gold.

579
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:10,136
It was my father's.

580
00:33:10,171 --> 00:33:12,188
- And if I had a buck every time I heard that line

581
00:33:12,222 --> 00:33:13,195
it would buy me Fort Knox.

582
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,377
Take the thousand go lucky.

583
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:17,922
I'll give you 3,000 if you sell it to me outright.

584
00:33:17,957 --> 00:33:18,860
- No way.

585
00:33:21,015 --> 00:33:22,197
I'll take the thousand.

586
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,480
I'll have the rest for you in a week.

587
00:33:27,514 --> 00:33:29,809
- We'll need the balance by Sunday.

588
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:31,095
- But that's in three days.

589
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:31,999
- Yes it is.

590
00:33:37,213 --> 00:33:38,880
- This is less than half his tuition.

591
00:33:38,915 --> 00:33:41,348
I can't over look the late payment penalty again.

592
00:33:41,384 --> 00:33:42,564
- I'll get it.

593
00:33:44,685 --> 00:33:45,311
- [Paul] Hello?

594
00:33:45,345 --> 00:33:46,319
- [Vendor] Is Laura there?

595
00:33:46,353 --> 00:33:48,056
- She's not here, may I ask who's calling?

596
00:33:48,091 --> 00:33:49,169
- [Vendor] This is Lauren at Wedding Belles.

597
00:33:49,203 --> 00:33:51,845
Um your fiancee brought in her dress this morning

598
00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:54,278
but it seems that she forgot to include the veil.

599
00:33:54,313 --> 00:33:55,633
- It didn't have one.

600
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,962
At least I didn't see one.

601
00:33:57,997 --> 00:33:59,491
She having it altered?

602
00:33:59,525 --> 00:34:02,306
- Not unless she wants to buy it back.

603
00:34:02,342 --> 00:34:06,026
This dress is the rarest find of all.

604
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,423
Mint condition, antique.

605
00:34:09,744 --> 00:34:10,891
Now you wanna go up to Velma's

606
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:14,158
and pay retail for a cheezy design and polyester lace

607
00:34:14,194 --> 00:34:18,086
be my guest but $1,000 for this dress, a bargain.

608
00:34:19,372 --> 00:34:21,249
- Yeah and how much did you give Laura for it?

609
00:34:21,285 --> 00:34:24,239
- Woof, plenty, I am way too generous.

610
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:25,316
- Well how about renting it?

611
00:34:25,351 --> 00:34:26,776
- We don't rent.

612
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,479
- You could if you wanted to.

613
00:34:28,513 --> 00:34:30,321
- Look Romeo don't get smart okay?

614
00:34:30,355 --> 00:34:32,337
You wanna get up on that balcony

615
00:34:32,372 --> 00:34:34,214
you gotta climb a prickly vine.

616
00:34:34,248 --> 00:34:38,628
I don't make the rules $1,000 no checks, Visa or Mastercard.

617
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:43,286
Gum however, is complimentary.

618
00:34:44,536 --> 00:34:46,447
- You told me 2,000 more if I sold it outright

619
00:34:46,482 --> 00:34:47,387
instead of taking the loan.

620
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,680
- I must have been in a generous mood.

621
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:51,349
But if that's what I said.

622
00:34:51,384 --> 00:34:53,399
- No Mr. Rodericks is not here.

623
00:34:53,434 --> 00:34:56,666
This is his fiancee may I ask what this is regarding?

624
00:34:56,701 --> 00:34:59,482
- [Concierge] Yes we show that he's reserved the Parisenne

625
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:00,803
room here at the St. George,

626
00:35:00,837 --> 00:35:04,904
please remind him that the rest of the money is due Sunday.

627
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:06,190
- The rest of the money?

628
00:35:06,225 --> 00:35:07,824
- [Concierge] Yes.

629
00:35:07,858 --> 00:35:08,588
- Of course.

630
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,168
(clatters)

631
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,946
Oh no the dress.

632
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,900
(dramatic music)

633
00:35:22,873 --> 00:35:23,951
- [Paul] Hey honey.

634
00:35:23,985 --> 00:35:25,654
- Dr. Rodericks I presume.

635
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:27,288
How was your day?

636
00:35:27,322 --> 00:35:28,816
- It's a jungle out there.

637
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:30,832
Hey.

638
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:36,290
Tomorrows that big dedication of the new wing

639
00:35:36,324 --> 00:35:39,452
but I'm on call til nine.

640
00:35:39,487 --> 00:35:41,537
- I was really looking forward to going.

641
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:43,554
I never get out in the world without an apron.

642
00:35:43,588 --> 00:35:45,362
- [Paul] Well it was just a cocktail party.

643
00:35:46,542 --> 00:35:47,933
Are you okay?

644
00:35:47,968 --> 00:35:50,019
- Yeah it's just the bills and everything.

645
00:35:54,954 --> 00:35:55,857
- Go without me.

646
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,385
Now, who can we get as an escort

647
00:36:01,418 --> 00:36:03,052
that wouldn't make me jealous?

648
00:36:03,088 --> 00:36:06,389
(light hearted music)

649
00:36:09,864 --> 00:36:11,672
(grunting)

650
00:36:11,707 --> 00:36:12,644
- Oh yeah, oh.

651
00:36:14,175 --> 00:36:15,878
Sold that dress yesterday.

652
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:17,650
Well sweetheart a beautiful gown like that

653
00:36:17,685 --> 00:36:18,241
gets snatched right up.

654
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:22,899
Look around, maybe you'll find something you like better.

655
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:26,200
(light hearted music)

656
00:36:35,932 --> 00:36:37,739
- Oh no, somebody got it.

657
00:36:37,775 --> 00:36:39,686
- Oh Art I'm so sorry.

658
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:41,320
You gave us such a wonderful gift--

659
00:36:41,355 --> 00:36:42,293
- Don't you worry about me.

660
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:44,240
I'm more worried about you.

661
00:36:44,274 --> 00:36:47,194
- Paul still thinks I have the dress.

662
00:36:47,228 --> 00:36:49,591
He rented a hotel banquet room for the wedding

663
00:36:49,627 --> 00:36:51,261
just so I could wear it

664
00:36:51,295 --> 00:36:54,805
and I think he pawned his father's watch.

665
00:36:57,446 --> 00:36:59,012
What am I gonna do?

666
00:36:59,046 --> 00:36:59,949
- Here.

667
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:02,486
Well you could use a good fairy godmother.

668
00:37:03,773 --> 00:37:05,963
(chattering)

669
00:37:05,997 --> 00:37:06,901
Wow.

670
00:37:10,863 --> 00:37:13,227
Nice party especially the guests.

671
00:37:16,423 --> 00:37:17,710
Oh, sorry.

672
00:37:17,745 --> 00:37:18,613
- Oh so sorry.

673
00:37:18,649 --> 00:37:19,656
Laura?

674
00:37:19,691 --> 00:37:20,908
Dr. Weineger.

675
00:37:20,943 --> 00:37:22,611
I haven't seen you since last semester.

676
00:37:22,646 --> 00:37:25,495
- Dr. Weineger it's so good to see you too.

677
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,234
I've been very busy this spring.

678
00:37:27,269 --> 00:37:30,049
- You and Paul both, he's my best student.

679
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:32,239
So when are you two going to get married?

680
00:37:33,976 --> 00:37:34,880
- Excuse me.

681
00:37:36,966 --> 00:37:38,008
- Oh boy.

682
00:37:38,043 --> 00:37:39,225
Me and my big mouth.

683
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:42,561
- Yeah but you have an arm like a Cadillac leaf spring.

684
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:43,465
- I'm sorry do we--

685
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,716
- Art the Dart Panner.

686
00:37:44,751 --> 00:37:48,053
Marshall High, class of '63, running back.

687
00:37:48,088 --> 00:37:48,956
- Panner?

688
00:37:48,992 --> 00:37:51,633
Oh you old rat, I didn't recognize you.

689
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:53,614
How do you know Laura?

690
00:37:53,649 --> 00:37:57,507
- Oh well Laura and Paul are like my own kids, you know.

691
00:37:57,541 --> 00:38:00,184
She's a little upset, they've got some big money problems.

692
00:38:00,218 --> 00:38:01,122
- Well can't her parents help out?

693
00:38:01,157 --> 00:38:03,033
I mean I know that Paul is an orphan.

694
00:38:03,068 --> 00:38:04,597
- No, her father left when she was kid,

695
00:38:04,632 --> 00:38:06,856
mother died a couple of years ago.

696
00:38:06,892 --> 00:38:10,298
Yeah, it's kinda hard to watch them struggle,

697
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:12,105
don't you think?

698
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,955
(light hearted music)

699
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:18,604
- The dead line was noon Mr. Rodericks.

700
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:21,246
We went ahead and book the room with another party.

701
00:38:21,281 --> 00:38:23,262
If you'll remember the deposit is nonrefundable.

702
00:38:23,297 --> 00:38:25,486
- But I was helping to save a man's life.

703
00:38:25,521 --> 00:38:28,093
I'm an hour late and you're keeping my $1,000?

704
00:38:28,128 --> 00:38:29,275
- My managers on vacation.

705
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:34,037
I'm not authorized to refund nonrefundable deposits.

706
00:38:34,071 --> 00:38:36,921
- Don't ever get sick and come to my hospital Haswell.

707
00:38:38,242 --> 00:38:39,146
(bell dings)

708
00:38:39,181 --> 00:38:40,049
(light hearted music)

709
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:41,092
- [Woman] I'll get the door.

710
00:38:41,127 --> 00:38:42,969
- [Man] Sure this stuff is okay in the hall?

711
00:38:43,004 --> 00:38:43,525
- [Woman] Oh yeah.

712
00:38:44,325 --> 00:38:45,194
- How's it going guys?

713
00:38:45,229 --> 00:38:49,191
(light hearted music)

714
00:38:49,225 --> 00:38:49,817
- [Man] Alright.

715
00:38:49,851 --> 00:38:50,685
- [Man] No it look great.

716
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,282
(chattering) (light hearted music)

717
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:02,711
- Ta da.

718
00:39:02,746 --> 00:39:03,963
- [Woman] Oh hey Art.

719
00:39:03,997 --> 00:39:06,327
- Hey, does anyone need some coffee to calm their nerves?

720
00:39:06,361 --> 00:39:09,732
- Hey Art I'm so glad you could come.

721
00:39:09,767 --> 00:39:11,226
What do you think?

722
00:39:11,262 --> 00:39:14,355
- Oh wow does she know that you're wearing a tux?

723
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,571
- Shhh.

724
00:39:15,606 --> 00:39:17,726
(light hearted music)

725
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,463
- Come on here.

726
00:39:19,499 --> 00:39:21,584
We are getting married today .

727
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:24,468
(light hearted music)

728
00:39:24,503 --> 00:39:26,728
- Hey, hey, hey everybody.

729
00:39:27,979 --> 00:39:29,231
(knocking)

730
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:30,309
Can I come in?

731
00:39:30,343 --> 00:39:31,802
I need my toothbrush.

732
00:39:36,391 --> 00:39:37,086
- Now don't peak.

733
00:39:38,546 --> 00:39:41,014
You're not supposed to see the bride before the ceremony.

734
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:42,404
- But I've already seen you in the dress

735
00:39:42,438 --> 00:39:43,690
if that's what you mean.

736
00:39:44,906 --> 00:39:47,895
- Ah, Paul, I have a confession to make,

737
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:53,144
I um, I sold the dress to pay for your tuition

738
00:39:53,179 --> 00:39:55,090
and I feel so terrible

739
00:39:55,124 --> 00:39:57,453
and I know that you sold your dad's watch

740
00:39:57,487 --> 00:39:58,496
to pay for the hotel

741
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,338
and now we don't have a dress or a watch...

742
00:40:00,374 --> 00:40:01,242
- Guess what, guess what?

743
00:40:01,277 --> 00:40:03,223
I have a confession too.

744
00:40:03,258 --> 00:40:04,682
The hotel stole my deposit

745
00:40:04,718 --> 00:40:06,003
and gave the room to somebody else.

746
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:07,150
- What?

747
00:40:07,186 --> 00:40:12,573
- But, but that was after I got a call from Lauren

748
00:40:12,607 --> 00:40:13,580
at Wedding Belles.

749
00:40:14,971 --> 00:40:17,231
(gasps)

750
00:40:17,265 --> 00:40:20,115
(chuckling) (gasping)

751
00:40:20,149 --> 00:40:21,192
Not bad huh?

752
00:40:24,077 --> 00:40:25,399
- I love you.

753
00:40:25,432 --> 00:40:26,440
Hi everybody.

754
00:40:26,475 --> 00:40:27,448
- [All] Hi.

755
00:40:28,734 --> 00:40:31,237
(knocking)

756
00:40:32,107 --> 00:40:32,836
- Hi everybody.

757
00:40:32,871 --> 00:40:33,670
- [Woman] Hi Doctor.

758
00:40:33,704 --> 00:40:34,956
- Paul I know, I'm sorry, I'm early

759
00:40:34,991 --> 00:40:39,683
but, well, Art and I wanted to give you a wedding present.

760
00:40:39,718 --> 00:40:42,082
- You can't give away something this precious.

761
00:40:44,167 --> 00:40:46,773
(chattering)

762
00:40:55,567 --> 00:40:56,679
- Oh hey.

763
00:40:56,714 --> 00:40:58,939
- Laura hurry I can't wait to see you in this dress.

764
00:40:58,973 --> 00:40:59,877
Come on.

765
00:40:59,912 --> 00:41:01,615
- That's right, we are in a hurry Paul

766
00:41:01,649 --> 00:41:03,040
we have to be somewhere in 15 minutes.

767
00:41:03,074 --> 00:41:04,187
- But the minister isn't here yet.

768
00:41:04,221 --> 00:41:05,125
- He's been detained.

769
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,828
- Yeah he was taken hostage.

770
00:41:06,863 --> 00:41:07,767
- What?

771
00:41:09,782 --> 00:41:10,651
What did you guys do?

772
00:41:10,686 --> 00:41:12,806
- Yeah 30 years I've been driving cab.

773
00:41:12,841 --> 00:41:13,988
Save, save, save for what?

774
00:41:14,023 --> 00:41:14,996
A tombstone?

775
00:41:15,031 --> 00:41:15,969
- Well where we gonna go?

776
00:41:16,004 --> 00:41:17,394
- The Parisenne room at the St. George.

777
00:41:17,429 --> 00:41:18,436
Now you wait til you see--

778
00:41:18,472 --> 00:41:20,557
- Come on Art don't give the whole thing away.

779
00:41:20,592 --> 00:41:22,747
- I can't believe this is happening.

780
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:25,007
- [Laura] Ready everybody?

781
00:41:26,674 --> 00:41:29,594
(romantic music)

782
00:41:38,353 --> 00:41:40,437
(thuds)

783
00:41:41,377 --> 00:41:43,080
(gasping)

784
00:41:43,115 --> 00:41:46,104
(coffee splashes)

785
00:41:53,959 --> 00:41:55,001
- Oh my God.

786
00:41:56,634 --> 00:41:58,720
My God what have I done?

787
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:03,934
- Paul,

788
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:08,070
I'm marrying you not the dress.

789
00:42:09,425 --> 00:42:12,623
Now I am the happiest woman in the world today

790
00:42:12,657 --> 00:42:14,708
and nothing is going to change that.

791
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:20,512
Give me two seconds everyone.

792
00:42:20,548 --> 00:42:23,294
(romantic music)

793
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:50,438
(gentle music)

794
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:57,356
Hey Travis long time no see.

795
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,129
- Hey, are you married yet

796
00:42:59,163 --> 00:43:00,380
or is there still a chance for me?

797
00:43:00,413 --> 00:43:02,673
- I am so married it's disgusting.

798
00:43:02,707 --> 00:43:03,404
Where's our Zoey?

799
00:43:03,437 --> 00:43:05,557
I haven't seen her in months.

800
00:43:05,593 --> 00:43:06,914
- I have no idea.

801
00:43:08,095 --> 00:43:10,181
She's gone without a trace.

802
00:43:10,216 --> 00:43:11,919
- Wow.

803
00:43:11,954 --> 00:43:15,012
She was so in love with you it wasn't funny.

804
00:43:15,047 --> 00:43:17,133
- How is it that everybody could see that but me?

805
00:43:18,418 --> 00:43:20,677
- Maybe you need to get yourself some glasses.

806
00:43:20,712 --> 00:43:23,457
(gentle music)

807
00:43:44,243 --> 00:43:46,849
- If I'm not mistaken there should be one more.

808
00:43:46,884 --> 00:43:51,715
Was a medical student, Roderic, Rodericks, Rodericks.

809
00:43:53,071 --> 00:43:55,573
- Oh yeah, you should have seen what we had to do,

810
00:43:55,607 --> 00:43:58,181
it looked like someone threw a pot of coffee at the bride.

811
00:43:58,215 --> 00:43:59,292
(laughing)

812
00:43:59,328 --> 00:44:01,309
- Must've been a wild wedding.

813
00:44:01,344 --> 00:44:03,915
Okay I will be right back.

814
00:44:03,949 --> 00:44:06,000
I'm just gonna put these in the van.

815
00:44:06,035 --> 00:44:08,016
- Wait, you want me to help you with that?

816
00:44:08,052 --> 00:44:10,519
- No that's alright, I'm stronger than I look.

817
00:44:10,553 --> 00:44:12,534
Why don't you look for the other one?

818
00:44:13,856 --> 00:44:16,497
(clattering)

819
00:44:21,051 --> 00:44:23,310
- Be careful lady or you'll lose everything.

820
00:44:26,437 --> 00:44:27,480
- Oh my God Billy.

821
00:44:28,384 --> 00:44:30,017
You work here?

822
00:44:30,053 --> 00:44:31,998
- Oh is that what they call it?

823
00:44:32,034 --> 00:44:34,710
Two months of continuous employment?

824
00:44:36,587 --> 00:44:38,915
- Wow that some kind of a record.

825
00:44:42,669 --> 00:44:45,519
You look so official in that uniform.

826
00:44:45,553 --> 00:44:49,724
- Yeah, the blue kinda matches my eyes don't you think?

827
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,324
I also got a raise.

828
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:52,228
- Oh yeah?

829
00:44:52,262 --> 00:44:53,096
You got a car yet?

830
00:44:54,313 --> 00:44:58,588
- Just don't go anywhere okay, like, wait just a minute.

831
00:45:00,533 --> 00:45:01,820
Here you go.

832
00:45:01,855 --> 00:45:04,879
- Oh great thanks, now this is billed to the hospital right?

833
00:45:04,914 --> 00:45:06,930
- Yes everything's all taken care of Mrs. Carver.

834
00:45:06,964 --> 00:45:07,937
- Okay.

835
00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:09,954
- Um do you want me to carry that for you.

836
00:45:09,988 --> 00:45:12,629
- No, no, no you've got another customer.

837
00:45:12,664 --> 00:45:14,854
- She's a special one.

838
00:45:14,889 --> 00:45:15,758
- Bye.

839
00:45:15,792 --> 00:45:16,696
- Thank you.

840
00:45:18,573 --> 00:45:20,554
- I can't find my ticket.

841
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:23,543
- No problem, I have the authority to have it totally

842
00:45:23,577 --> 00:45:25,247
taken care of.

843
00:45:25,281 --> 00:45:26,811
Just sign here.

844
00:45:28,931 --> 00:45:31,502
And you can put down your ring size too

845
00:45:31,537 --> 00:45:33,970
because you know I might be wanting to put a deposit

846
00:45:34,005 --> 00:45:34,874
on a certain something.

847
00:45:34,909 --> 00:45:36,612
- Now slow down Billy.

848
00:45:36,646 --> 00:45:39,324
Winning my heart is not like playing a lottery ticket.

849
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:41,477
- I know, I know, I'm fully aware.

850
00:45:41,513 --> 00:45:45,198
A job, a car, a proposal.

851
00:45:45,232 --> 00:45:46,517
You know but this is good you know,

852
00:45:46,552 --> 00:45:48,742
we got rules you know,

853
00:45:48,776 --> 00:45:50,306
we got some structure you know.

854
00:45:50,342 --> 00:45:51,488
It's all good.

855
00:45:51,522 --> 00:45:54,650
In fact I, I gotta document it.

856
00:45:56,423 --> 00:45:58,474
Relax, it's mine.

857
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:03,132
(clicking)

858
00:46:11,265 --> 00:46:13,141
- Hey, hey, hey Billy, Billy.

859
00:46:14,254 --> 00:46:16,721
We need a word, again.

860
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,956
- So the theme of this years fund raiser is

861
00:46:28,991 --> 00:46:30,833
the Wedding Dress.

862
00:46:32,362 --> 00:46:35,420
Do you think that's politically incorrect Robert?

863
00:46:35,455 --> 00:46:38,618
Men bidding for dates with the women who model the dresses.

864
00:46:41,816 --> 00:46:46,647
Last year somebody paid $5,000 to nibble wilted water cress

865
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:48,107
with Mora Thickman.

866
00:46:48,142 --> 00:46:50,158
- Isn't she married to that accountant?

867
00:46:50,193 --> 00:46:52,834
- Yeah who by the way, calculated that Mora's bidder

868
00:46:52,868 --> 00:46:54,954
paid $300 a bite.

869
00:46:56,275 --> 00:46:58,082
Ever since then he's treated her like a much more

870
00:46:58,117 --> 00:47:01,316
valuable asset, he calls her his little write off.

871
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:02,635
- I'd bid on my own wife.

872
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:06,423
- Yeah, go for it.

873
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:07,848
It's at the children's hospital.

874
00:47:07,884 --> 00:47:10,664
(gentle music)

875
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:25,054
- [Woman] Where do you think you're going?

876
00:47:25,088 --> 00:47:27,765
(phone ringing)

877
00:47:36,107 --> 00:47:37,740
- Hello?

878
00:47:37,774 --> 00:47:39,061
- Hey hon.

879
00:47:39,096 --> 00:47:40,694
- Hey.

880
00:47:40,729 --> 00:47:43,232
- Hey the New York trip is back on the books again.

881
00:47:43,267 --> 00:47:45,109
Jeff and I are on the four o'clock.

882
00:47:45,144 --> 00:47:47,089
I'll be back Friday late okay?

883
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:47,993
(giggling)

884
00:47:48,028 --> 00:47:48,584
- Sure.

885
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:49,592
Where are you?

886
00:47:49,626 --> 00:47:52,199
It sounds like you're having a good time.

887
00:47:52,234 --> 00:47:53,902
- Just leaving a boring business lunch.

888
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:55,258
I'm calling you tonight.

889
00:47:55,293 --> 00:47:56,023
Kiss Stella.

890
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,776
(phone beeps)

891
00:48:05,789 --> 00:48:07,006
- [Woman] We don't wanna be late.

892
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:12,914
(thuds)

893
00:48:15,694 --> 00:48:17,884
- Mommy, when's daddy coming home?

894
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,275
- I don't know.

895
00:48:21,534 --> 00:48:22,541
- Does he know?

896
00:48:22,576 --> 00:48:23,793
- Well I'm not sure.

897
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:28,311
- So, nobody knows.

898
00:48:31,821 --> 00:48:34,985
- Yeah, I'm sorry Stella but nobody does know.

899
00:48:40,406 --> 00:48:43,465
(kettle whistling)

900
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,930
(door bell rings)

901
00:48:49,965 --> 00:48:50,868
- Mrs. Carter.

902
00:48:52,675 --> 00:48:53,858
- Yes.

903
00:48:53,892 --> 00:48:55,283
- I'm sorry to just come over like this.

904
00:48:55,318 --> 00:48:57,507
I begged the cleaners to give me your address.

905
00:48:57,542 --> 00:48:59,315
My daughter's wedding is the day after tomorrow

906
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:00,913
and her dress was being altered.

907
00:49:00,949 --> 00:49:02,756
I think it was given to you by mistake.

908
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:05,501
- Well I don't have the dresses here.

909
00:49:05,536 --> 00:49:07,378
They're being stored at the hospital.

910
00:49:07,413 --> 00:49:08,908
It's for a benefit thing.

911
00:49:09,845 --> 00:49:11,444
- Is this your dress?

912
00:49:11,479 --> 00:49:13,912
- I don't know, I mean the dresses were donated

913
00:49:13,948 --> 00:49:15,059
I just picked them up.

914
00:49:18,397 --> 00:49:19,439
It's very, very pretty.

915
00:49:19,473 --> 00:49:21,038
Look at those little pearls.

916
00:49:22,324 --> 00:49:24,027
I think that lace is all handmade.

917
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:25,695
It's really, it's exquisite.

918
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:28,232
- Unfortunately it doesn't fit my daughter.

919
00:49:28,268 --> 00:49:29,552
- No, well, um.

920
00:49:31,673 --> 00:49:34,280
I would take you over there but I'm,

921
00:49:34,316 --> 00:49:36,852
I'm busy so I'll just get a pen and paper

922
00:49:36,887 --> 00:49:38,138
and give you directions.

923
00:49:38,173 --> 00:49:40,190
- Here's a pen, just write it on my arm.

924
00:49:47,488 --> 00:49:48,218
- Where?

925
00:49:48,253 --> 00:49:49,156
You've got the phone book here.

926
00:49:49,192 --> 00:49:51,207
Why don't you give me your other arm.

927
00:49:54,127 --> 00:49:55,725
- It's the best secretary in the world.

928
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,332
The only downside is it looks a little idiotic.

929
00:50:03,789 --> 00:50:06,083
- You're the only other person I've met who does this.

930
00:50:07,751 --> 00:50:09,453
I'd take that as a good sign except you're the only person

931
00:50:09,489 --> 00:50:11,783
I've ever met who carries around a spoon.

932
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,450
(sighs)

933
00:50:13,486 --> 00:50:18,664
- Um look, why don't I, why don't I just drive over there

934
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,472
and you can follow me okay?

935
00:50:20,507 --> 00:50:21,619
But you take the dress.

936
00:50:21,654 --> 00:50:23,079
- But I thought you were busy?

937
00:50:23,113 --> 00:50:25,442
- Well I lied, I'm just depressed

938
00:50:25,476 --> 00:50:27,806
and I wanted to be left alone.

939
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,030
- That's the worst thing you can do if you're depressed.

940
00:50:30,066 --> 00:50:31,317
- I know don't remind me.

941
00:50:32,394 --> 00:50:33,958
It's too depressing.

942
00:50:33,993 --> 00:50:35,870
- I know the feeling.

943
00:50:35,904 --> 00:50:37,365
It's like looking at your life through the wrong end

944
00:50:37,399 --> 00:50:38,233
of a telescope.

945
00:50:39,518 --> 00:50:40,422
I'm Steve.

946
00:50:42,438 --> 00:50:43,516
- I'm Madeline.

947
00:50:51,128 --> 00:50:52,171
This one it?

948
00:50:53,248 --> 00:50:57,385
- No it's ah, it's the wrong style.

949
00:51:00,442 --> 00:51:04,197
Well, no dress, no preacher and no flowers.

950
00:51:06,213 --> 00:51:08,332
She'll keep the groom under house arrest.

951
00:51:08,368 --> 00:51:09,862
- Why no preacher and no flowers?

952
00:51:09,897 --> 00:51:12,052
- Ah the preacher has laryngitis,

953
00:51:12,086 --> 00:51:14,380
florist thought it was next Saturday.

954
00:51:15,701 --> 00:51:17,716
And you stole my dress.

955
00:51:17,752 --> 00:51:18,655
- Hey.

956
00:51:21,401 --> 00:51:22,861
Look, is this it?

957
00:51:24,008 --> 00:51:24,911
This one?

958
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:29,361
- That's it.

959
00:51:31,863 --> 00:51:32,766
Thank God.

960
00:51:33,879 --> 00:51:35,720
- I'm a landscape architect,

961
00:51:35,756 --> 00:51:37,493
I could help you with the flowers.

962
00:51:37,528 --> 00:51:39,613
Only I'm very expensive.

963
00:51:39,649 --> 00:51:41,768
- That's okay I'm rich

964
00:51:41,804 --> 00:51:43,264
and I'm desperate.

965
00:51:45,036 --> 00:51:48,407
- I'm not really very expensive.

966
00:51:48,442 --> 00:51:50,422
- I'm not rich, I'm just desperate.

967
00:51:50,458 --> 00:51:53,343
(laughing)

968
00:51:53,378 --> 00:51:55,567
- [Steve] Oh, Kathy I can't do this.

969
00:51:55,602 --> 00:51:58,348
Trying to thread a needle with boxing gloves on.

970
00:51:58,383 --> 00:52:00,260
- I can get it daddy.

971
00:52:00,295 --> 00:52:03,075
I was just trying to make you feel useful.

972
00:52:03,109 --> 00:52:05,577
(laughing)

973
00:52:07,316 --> 00:52:08,219
I miss mom today.

974
00:52:11,069 --> 00:52:12,251
- Everyday honey.

975
00:52:12,286 --> 00:52:14,232
(tapping)

976
00:52:14,267 --> 00:52:16,283
- Now your dad said you wanted something,

977
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:17,291
something different so.

978
00:52:17,325 --> 00:52:18,471
- Wow I love it!

979
00:52:19,549 --> 00:52:21,426
White is so, white.

980
00:52:22,365 --> 00:52:24,763
- Hey the church looks terrific.

981
00:52:24,798 --> 00:52:30,081
- Well congratulations and don't forget to breathe, okay.

982
00:52:30,116 --> 00:52:30,984
Oh.

983
00:52:32,341 --> 00:52:33,348
Hi sweetie.

984
00:52:34,494 --> 00:52:36,789
- Thank you for everything.

985
00:52:36,824 --> 00:52:38,422
- Well you are welcome.

986
00:52:39,499 --> 00:52:40,405
Bye.

987
00:52:44,713 --> 00:52:46,625
- Mommy I'm so hungry.

988
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:47,772
Can we get some pizza?

989
00:52:50,761 --> 00:52:53,021
- Sure, would you like to order it yourself?

990
00:52:54,028 --> 00:52:56,844
(phone ringing)

991
00:52:58,859 --> 00:52:59,763
- Hello?

992
00:53:00,458 --> 00:53:01,849
Hi daddy.

993
00:53:01,883 --> 00:53:03,136
When are you coming home?

994
00:53:05,047 --> 00:53:06,264
He wants to talk to you.

995
00:53:13,909 --> 00:53:14,882
- Mmhmm?

996
00:53:14,918 --> 00:53:17,419
- Why haven't you been answering my calls.

997
00:53:17,455 --> 00:53:19,505
- This is the last time you're gonna hear my voice.

998
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:22,391
My lawyer will call you sometime this week.

999
00:53:22,424 --> 00:53:23,954
- Who did you get?

1000
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:25,518
- Your worst nightmare.

1001
00:53:25,553 --> 00:53:28,021
- You're doing something you're really gonna regret.

1002
00:53:28,055 --> 00:53:32,539
- No, Rob what I regret is having married you.

1003
00:53:38,691 --> 00:53:41,820
(knocking)

1004
00:53:41,854 --> 00:53:44,114
- Look what I found in my truck.

1005
00:53:44,148 --> 00:53:45,921
- It's deja vu all over again.

1006
00:53:47,936 --> 00:53:49,744
- I think that dress has your name on it.

1007
00:53:49,779 --> 00:53:51,586
Will you wear it at the benefit?

1008
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:55,097
- Well I don't know, it'll take a little work.

1009
00:53:57,807 --> 00:53:59,302
A lot of work.

1010
00:54:02,464 --> 00:54:03,890
- So ah...

1011
00:54:05,106 --> 00:54:06,185
- Thank you.

1012
00:54:06,219 --> 00:54:07,748
- Sure.

1013
00:54:07,783 --> 00:54:09,555
Um I wanted to ask you something.

1014
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:13,066
- No Steve, no I'm getting a divorce now.

1015
00:54:13,101 --> 00:54:16,229
And frankly, no offense I am allergic to men right now.

1016
00:54:16,264 --> 00:54:19,982
I don't want a male parakeet under this roof.

1017
00:54:20,018 --> 00:54:22,033
I don't want a mosquito with male paraphernalia.

1018
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,639
- Well if I'd been trying to pick you up

1019
00:54:24,675 --> 00:54:28,012
that would have been the sexiest response I can imagine.

1020
00:54:28,046 --> 00:54:30,583
- Well weren't you trying to, pick me up?

1021
00:54:31,521 --> 00:54:33,781
- It's not that, you're very,

1022
00:54:35,241 --> 00:54:36,944
you know you're very beautiful.

1023
00:54:40,142 --> 00:54:43,374
Truth is my wife was the love of my life

1024
00:54:43,408 --> 00:54:46,120
and I don't anticipate recovering from losing her.

1025
00:54:47,683 --> 00:54:49,596
- Well I understand that.

1026
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:51,854
- So now having cheered you up.

1027
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:54,149
What I was actually gonna ask you,

1028
00:54:54,184 --> 00:54:56,616
I'm running a job that needs a landscape architect

1029
00:54:56,651 --> 00:54:59,745
and, let me give you the number in case you decide

1030
00:54:59,779 --> 00:55:00,648
you're interested.

1031
00:55:00,683 --> 00:55:03,151
(gentle music)

1032
00:55:15,419 --> 00:55:17,992
(gentle music)

1033
00:55:34,223 --> 00:55:37,456
- Hello this is Madeline Carter, I'm a landscape architect,

1034
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:39,610
I'm calling at Steve Blaine's suggestion.

1035
00:55:47,014 --> 00:55:50,038
- My neighborhood association is considering picketing me.

1036
00:55:50,073 --> 00:55:52,783
They say I've gotta tidy this place up.

1037
00:55:52,819 --> 00:55:53,966
- You might buy a rake.

1038
00:55:55,113 --> 00:55:58,032
You could have told me this was for you.

1039
00:56:00,673 --> 00:56:02,758
- I was afraid you'd get the wrong impression.

1040
00:56:07,451 --> 00:56:08,320
So what do you think?

1041
00:56:08,355 --> 00:56:12,977
- Well, I think it has possibilities.

1042
00:56:13,013 --> 00:56:16,280
(light hearted music)

1043
00:56:18,991 --> 00:56:20,624
- [Steve] Hey.

1044
00:56:20,658 --> 00:56:22,188
- [Madeline] Hey.

1045
00:56:22,223 --> 00:56:23,648
- Just lost half an hour looking for this.

1046
00:56:23,682 --> 00:56:25,559
- Oh I'm sorry I--

1047
00:56:25,594 --> 00:56:27,679
- I hope you're a good climber.

1048
00:56:27,714 --> 00:56:28,513
- Hey!

1049
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,711
This entire pile has to move alright?

1050
00:56:31,746 --> 00:56:32,824
- [Woman] Yeah.

1051
00:56:32,858 --> 00:56:34,909
- We gotta do that now and then we gotta put down

1052
00:56:34,944 --> 00:56:35,396
the decomposed granite.

1053
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:36,265
- [Woman] Okay.

1054
00:56:36,299 --> 00:56:38,698
- And that soil and then the mulch

1055
00:56:38,732 --> 00:56:41,478
and, and, and what am I forgetting?

1056
00:56:41,512 --> 00:56:42,938
Then the roses.

1057
00:56:42,973 --> 00:56:44,502
That's right.

1058
00:56:44,536 --> 00:56:46,136
- Hey can you keep it down?

1059
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:47,526
Men are trying to concentrate here.

1060
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,395
(laughing)

1061
00:56:48,429 --> 00:56:49,125
- That's their problem.

1062
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,905
Okay go, that things gotta go.

1063
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,538
- That doesn't look half bad.

1064
00:56:55,103 --> 00:56:56,875
- It's coming along.

1065
00:56:56,911 --> 00:56:59,309
- There's another project on the horizon, a big one.

1066
00:56:59,343 --> 00:57:01,186
Fix you and Stella a home cooked meal Saturday night

1067
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:02,993
if you'll come over and look at the plans.

1068
00:57:03,027 --> 00:57:05,287
- I don't know, sounds a lot like a date.

1069
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:06,503
- It's not a date.

1070
00:57:06,537 --> 00:57:07,858
- Well what is it then?

1071
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:10,118
- To place an estimate.

1072
00:57:11,335 --> 00:57:12,238
- You know what?

1073
00:57:14,323 --> 00:57:17,939
Robert never once washed a dish or made a meal,

1074
00:57:17,973 --> 00:57:20,684
not once the entire time we were married.

1075
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:23,534
- And you let him get away with that?

1076
00:57:23,569 --> 00:57:25,967
- I was as blind as a bat.

1077
00:57:27,218 --> 00:57:28,748
You know how you look at your yearbook

1078
00:57:28,782 --> 00:57:30,868
and you see that frizzed out hair do

1079
00:57:30,902 --> 00:57:34,135
and you think oh my God what was I thinking?

1080
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:36,776
That's how I feel about Robert

1081
00:57:36,812 --> 00:57:40,773
and his attitude and his infidelity.

1082
00:57:43,346 --> 00:57:44,875
Why couldn't I see it?

1083
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:45,882
- How could you?

1084
00:57:45,918 --> 00:57:46,891
You were in love with him.

1085
00:57:48,316 --> 00:57:50,609
- Yes I was, very much.

1086
00:57:53,009 --> 00:57:55,858
And what do you miss the most about your wife?

1087
00:57:58,327 --> 00:58:00,272
- Everything.

1088
00:58:00,308 --> 00:58:02,879
Hey you girls stop jumping on that sofa.

1089
00:58:02,914 --> 00:58:04,965
Jump on the other one so that it gets equal damage.

1090
00:58:04,999 --> 00:58:07,466
(laughing)

1091
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:15,983
- Do you think you'll ever risk falling in love again.

1092
00:58:16,503 --> 00:58:18,138
- I don't know.

1093
00:58:18,172 --> 00:58:21,057
I got lucky once I'm not sure I believe in second chances.

1094
00:58:45,456 --> 00:58:48,133
- I think I better go home.

1095
00:58:48,167 --> 00:58:50,670
- I think you're right.

1096
00:58:50,704 --> 00:58:51,851
(knocking)

1097
00:58:51,887 --> 00:58:52,720
- [Madeline] Just a minute.

1098
00:58:52,755 --> 00:58:53,868
Shh.

1099
00:58:53,902 --> 00:58:55,709
- [Robert] Please baby open the door I missed you.

1100
00:58:55,744 --> 00:58:56,439
- Robert?

1101
00:58:56,474 --> 00:58:57,343
- [Robert] I miss Stella, honey.

1102
00:58:57,379 --> 00:59:00,645
- [Madeline] Oh Stella is sleeping.

1103
00:59:00,679 --> 00:59:02,000
- [Robert] Open up please.

1104
00:59:19,066 --> 00:59:21,533
(knocking)

1105
00:59:29,146 --> 00:59:30,363
- You Robert?

1106
00:59:30,398 --> 00:59:31,788
- Yeah.

1107
00:59:31,822 --> 00:59:32,552
Who are you?

1108
00:59:34,498 --> 00:59:36,513
- That's not important.

1109
00:59:42,701 --> 00:59:43,918
(door clicks)

1110
00:59:43,952 --> 00:59:46,837
(dramatic music)

1111
00:59:57,264 --> 00:59:59,245
- Hey Stella when you're done there we could use a little

1112
00:59:59,281 --> 01:00:01,713
help clearing the table.

1113
01:00:01,748 --> 01:00:02,651
Okay hon?

1114
01:00:09,012 --> 01:00:10,959
How do you do this garbage thing?

1115
01:00:17,667 --> 01:00:20,343
(motor rumbles)

1116
01:00:22,011 --> 01:00:24,548
I have to be in court for eight o'clock,

1117
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:26,113
I need to make a few calls.

1118
01:00:36,192 --> 01:00:38,278
This'll be a quick call.

1119
01:00:38,312 --> 01:00:39,876
- I just wanted to thank you.

1120
01:00:39,911 --> 01:00:42,379
- Maddy, I wanted to come back, no need to thank me.

1121
01:00:42,413 --> 01:00:43,525
I'll just be a sec.

1122
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,836
- No I mean, I wanted to thank you for leaving me.

1123
01:00:49,331 --> 01:00:50,338
- What do you mean?

1124
01:00:54,995 --> 01:00:57,915
(dramatic music)

1125
01:00:59,792 --> 01:01:01,565
- Right, hey, hey to the other side.

1126
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:02,468
- [Man] Okay.

1127
01:01:02,503 --> 01:01:03,580
- Good thanks.

1128
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,553
- Have you seen Steve?

1129
01:01:04,589 --> 01:01:05,874
- No I haven't, sorry.

1130
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,021
- Do you know where he is?

1131
01:01:07,057 --> 01:01:07,890
- I really don't know.

1132
01:01:07,925 --> 01:01:10,427
(dramatic music)

1133
01:01:21,341 --> 01:01:22,697
(answering machine beeps)

1134
01:01:22,731 --> 01:01:27,945
- Steve, it's me, here we are both of us terrified.

1135
01:01:31,386 --> 01:01:33,889
I know I am a mess.

1136
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:35,418
You know I guess there's very good reason,

1137
01:01:35,452 --> 01:01:38,754
you don't believe in second chances it's cause of this.

1138
01:01:38,789 --> 01:01:40,388
Did you come by my house today?

1139
01:01:41,604 --> 01:01:43,690
Well I mean who knows what you're feeling.

1140
01:01:43,724 --> 01:01:45,255
Well you know what you're feeling.

1141
01:01:45,289 --> 01:01:49,112
You know all I know is, is, I,

1142
01:01:50,225 --> 01:01:54,639
you and we do you know what I mean?

1143
01:01:56,307 --> 01:01:58,879
(chuckling)

1144
01:02:00,651 --> 01:02:03,224
(clatters)

1145
01:02:03,259 --> 01:02:05,379
(audience applauding)

1146
01:02:05,412 --> 01:02:08,472
- [Auctioneer] Who wants to buy dinner with Sara York

1147
01:02:08,506 --> 01:02:10,592
in a magnificent Vera Wang.

1148
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:11,495
- [Man] 300.

1149
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:14,554
- [Auctioneer] Did I just hear $300?

1150
01:02:14,589 --> 01:02:15,562
- [Man] You certainly did.

1151
01:02:15,597 --> 01:02:17,821
- Cheap date thank you very much Mr. York.

1152
01:02:17,857 --> 01:02:20,707
(audience applauding)

1153
01:02:20,741 --> 01:02:25,260
Now moving along to number 25, this is a whole new slant

1154
01:02:25,295 --> 01:02:28,319
on the way they welcomed the boys home.

1155
01:02:28,353 --> 01:02:32,246
This is Madeline Cater in a redesigned, vintage

1156
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:33,636
World War II dress.

1157
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:34,504
- [Man] 90.

1158
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:35,651
- I already hear 90.

1159
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:38,641
Can I please hear $100.

1160
01:02:39,684 --> 01:02:41,803
People this is for the children.

1161
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:44,029
Someone 200 please.

1162
01:02:44,063 --> 01:02:45,176
Thank you.

1163
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:46,079
Can I hear 250?

1164
01:02:46,114 --> 01:02:46,983
- [Man] 250.

1165
01:02:47,017 --> 01:02:48,026
- 250 thank you.

1166
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,971
Can I hear 300?

1167
01:02:50,007 --> 01:02:55,255
Wait I, I see $800, sold for $800.

1168
01:02:56,436 --> 01:02:59,425
To the gentleman in the tuxedo.

1169
01:02:59,459 --> 01:03:00,642
Thank you sir.

1170
01:03:02,902 --> 01:03:06,030
- Number 25 I believe you owe me a meal.

1171
01:03:06,064 --> 01:03:07,247
- Steve.

1172
01:03:07,281 --> 01:03:09,748
- I never bought anyone before so I don't know whether

1173
01:03:09,783 --> 01:03:11,208
I should bow to you

1174
01:03:11,244 --> 01:03:13,398
or throw you over my shoulder.

1175
01:03:13,432 --> 01:03:17,082
- Well I think technically you just rented me for dinner.

1176
01:03:17,117 --> 01:03:18,195
- Time's short then.

1177
01:03:19,099 --> 01:03:20,488
To hell with bowing.

1178
01:03:20,523 --> 01:03:21,462
- Oh!

1179
01:03:21,496 --> 01:03:22,573
(gasping)

1180
01:03:22,609 --> 01:03:25,875
(audience applauding)

1181
01:03:30,255 --> 01:03:31,124
- What?

1182
01:03:31,159 --> 01:03:32,376
You lost another job?

1183
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:33,905
- I can't believe it.

1184
01:03:33,939 --> 01:03:34,947
- I can.

1185
01:03:34,982 --> 01:03:36,859
You don't concentrate.

1186
01:03:36,893 --> 01:03:39,257
- Well I'm gonna get a new one at a courier service.

1187
01:03:39,293 --> 01:03:40,161
- What about a car?

1188
01:03:40,196 --> 01:03:44,158
- Well not yet but I'm gonna get one.

1189
01:03:44,192 --> 01:03:46,695
- Well while you're in such a getting mood,

1190
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:48,711
you better get yourself another girl.

1191
01:03:54,967 --> 01:03:55,871
- Courier.

1192
01:03:57,018 --> 01:04:00,320
- Oh Billy from the dry cleaners.

1193
01:04:00,355 --> 01:04:02,267
- Ah that didn't work out.

1194
01:04:02,301 --> 01:04:03,101
- Oh.

1195
01:04:03,135 --> 01:04:06,506
- Hey Mrs. Carter, I'm really late.

1196
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:08,140
- Oh okay.

1197
01:04:08,175 --> 01:04:10,226
Um this one goes to the museum

1198
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:13,006
and this one goes to the historical society

1199
01:04:13,041 --> 01:04:15,057
and maybe you can help me with this?

1200
01:04:18,011 --> 01:04:18,880
- Here we go.

1201
01:04:18,915 --> 01:04:19,575
(rips) (beads clicking)

1202
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:20,722
(gasps)

1203
01:04:20,757 --> 01:04:24,893
Oh my God, I'm, I'm, I'm really sorry Mrs. Carter.

1204
01:04:24,928 --> 01:04:25,832
- Right.

1205
01:04:28,196 --> 01:04:29,064
Thank you.

1206
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:32,261
Well it's okay Billy.

1207
01:04:33,964 --> 01:04:36,675
It's okay because it's a very special dress

1208
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:38,448
and I don't think a little damage

1209
01:04:38,482 --> 01:04:40,881
is gonna make any difference okay?

1210
01:04:42,133 --> 01:04:45,956
Here, if you just lay that tissue over the top

1211
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:48,493
that'd be really good.

1212
01:04:48,527 --> 01:04:50,787
Just fold up the sides.

1213
01:04:56,731 --> 01:04:58,225
Here, waybill.

1214
01:04:59,268 --> 01:04:59,963
Take it.

1215
01:04:59,998 --> 01:05:02,049
- I know put it on the top.

1216
01:05:02,083 --> 01:05:02,917
- [Madeline] Okay.

1217
01:05:02,952 --> 01:05:05,593
(clattering)

1218
01:05:30,479 --> 01:05:32,808
(clattering)

1219
01:05:34,095 --> 01:05:36,840
- Deke Johannsen do you swear to tell the truth,

1220
01:05:36,875 --> 01:05:40,281
the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God?

1221
01:05:40,316 --> 01:05:41,220
- I do.

1222
01:05:47,858 --> 01:05:51,334
- You do realize the penalty for prejury do you not

1223
01:05:51,369 --> 01:05:52,585
Mr. Johannsen?

1224
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:56,860
- Ben just ask Deke if the creek changed course by itself

1225
01:05:56,894 --> 01:05:59,120
or if he went out there and diverted it with his tractor

1226
01:05:59,154 --> 01:06:01,274
as Joan claims he did.

1227
01:06:01,309 --> 01:06:02,838
- I never touched that creek.

1228
01:06:02,873 --> 01:06:03,846
(giggling)

1229
01:06:03,881 --> 01:06:06,939
- Mr. Johannsen you are aware are you not,

1230
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:10,172
that the creek bed is the original property line

1231
01:06:10,207 --> 01:06:13,821
between yours and Ms. Delanos properties.

1232
01:06:13,856 --> 01:06:16,601
- Objection Your Honor, the deed states only

1233
01:06:16,637 --> 01:06:18,444
that the creek bed shall mark the boundary,

1234
01:06:18,478 --> 01:06:20,772
it makes no reference to natural forces.

1235
01:06:20,808 --> 01:06:23,276
Last month's rain could just as easily have diverted

1236
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:25,222
into Deke's property.

1237
01:06:25,256 --> 01:06:26,126
- Sustained.

1238
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,411
- What?

1239
01:06:27,446 --> 01:06:29,566
- Looks to me like an act of God Fred.

1240
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,686
- Well what about the tractor noise coming from Deke's

1241
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:32,903
the night before?

1242
01:06:32,937 --> 01:06:36,413
Your Honor we are all well aware of Deke's devious ways

1243
01:06:36,448 --> 01:06:37,352
around here.

1244
01:06:37,387 --> 01:06:38,325
- Objection.

1245
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:39,194
- Over ruled.

1246
01:06:39,229 --> 01:06:40,828
- May I say something Your Honor?

1247
01:06:41,905 --> 01:06:43,608
- I'm all ears.

1248
01:06:43,642 --> 01:06:46,562
- I most distinctly heard the clanking of metal treads,

1249
01:06:46,597 --> 01:06:49,204
now that's a sound I know very well, believe me.

1250
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:53,444
After 18 years of living next to that philistine junk yard

1251
01:06:53,478 --> 01:06:55,287
that he calls a sculpture garden.

1252
01:06:55,322 --> 01:06:57,545
- The only clanking Ms. Delano heard that night

1253
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:00,222
was her yellow dentures on her little pink night stand.

1254
01:07:00,257 --> 01:07:00,952
(laughing)

1255
01:07:00,986 --> 01:07:01,856
- Objection!

1256
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:03,523
I do not wear dentures.

1257
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:06,409
Call in Dr. Wrinker and have him bring in my xrays.

1258
01:07:06,443 --> 01:07:09,954
And furthermore, my nightstand is blue.

1259
01:07:09,988 --> 01:07:11,275
(laughing)

1260
01:07:11,309 --> 01:07:12,248
(gavel banging)

1261
01:07:12,283 --> 01:07:14,159
- Settle down, settle down.

1262
01:07:14,195 --> 01:07:18,052
- Your Honor Deke Johannsen is an aesthetic nightmare

1263
01:07:18,087 --> 01:07:19,442
of a neighbor.

1264
01:07:19,476 --> 01:07:22,536
How can an artist survive next to a war zone?

1265
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:24,517
- It's a sculpture garden!

1266
01:07:24,551 --> 01:07:25,838
(gavel bangs)

1267
01:07:25,873 --> 01:07:29,487
- Just out of curiosity, which one of you lived there first?

1268
01:07:29,521 --> 01:07:31,712
- Well that'd be me Your Honor, I got first rights,

1269
01:07:31,746 --> 01:07:32,928
early bird gets the worm.

1270
01:07:32,963 --> 01:07:35,327
- Yes but the second mouse gets the cheese.

1271
01:07:35,362 --> 01:07:36,752
(laughing)

1272
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:38,837
- Well here's a plain fact for you.

1273
01:07:38,872 --> 01:07:42,140
Judge my tractor's been broke down for the last six months.

1274
01:07:42,174 --> 01:07:45,544
I got a signed statement from Ralph down to the garage.

1275
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:48,222
(chattering)

1276
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:56,146
- Well I'd say that wraps it up.

1277
01:07:56,181 --> 01:08:00,699
Here's my ruling, it's common knowledge that Deke here

1278
01:08:00,734 --> 01:08:04,141
and Joan have lived in discord for as long as any of us

1279
01:08:04,175 --> 01:08:07,095
can remember, therefore in the interests of settling this

1280
01:08:07,129 --> 01:08:11,022
once and for all I order Deke Johannsen

1281
01:08:11,057 --> 01:08:14,220
to rechannel that creek bed back to it's previous

1282
01:08:14,254 --> 01:08:15,783
God given course.

1283
01:08:15,818 --> 01:08:16,479
- Yes.

1284
01:08:16,513 --> 01:08:17,521
(applauding)

1285
01:08:17,556 --> 01:08:21,901
- And I order Joan Delano to pay for a survey

1286
01:08:21,935 --> 01:08:24,646
to act as a permanent record of the property line

1287
01:08:24,681 --> 01:08:27,426
until hell freezes over or I get my hair back

1288
01:08:27,462 --> 01:08:28,469
which ever happens first.

1289
01:08:28,505 --> 01:08:30,313
(applauding)

1290
01:08:30,347 --> 01:08:33,474
And as an addendum I order both parties to exercise

1291
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:36,603
neighborly civility towards each other

1292
01:08:36,637 --> 01:08:40,948
or I will remand you both to the county jail for 10 days.

1293
01:08:40,982 --> 01:08:42,025
(gavel bangs)

1294
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:45,327
(light hearted music)

1295
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:54,433
(engine rumbles) (light hearted music)

1296
01:09:33,778 --> 01:09:36,281
(engine rumbles)

1297
01:09:36,316 --> 01:09:37,324
- Oh God.

1298
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:43,544
The junk man cometh.

1299
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:46,498
(engine rumbles)

1300
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:08,987
(engine rumbles)

1301
01:10:23,898 --> 01:10:28,382
(thuds) (cries out)

1302
01:10:34,673 --> 01:10:35,576
- This is private property!

1303
01:10:35,611 --> 01:10:38,009
- [Deke] It's just a bunch of old rags.

1304
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,644
(engine rumbles)

1305
01:10:54,414 --> 01:10:56,014
- Oh my goodness.

1306
01:10:58,342 --> 01:10:59,316
You're no rag.

1307
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:02,130
(gentle music)

1308
01:11:25,417 --> 01:11:28,720
(light hearted music)

1309
01:12:35,453 --> 01:12:38,338
(engine rumbles)

1310
01:12:43,621 --> 01:12:44,455
- The point of beginning.

1311
01:12:44,489 --> 01:12:45,776
- Okay that sections there's done.

1312
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:48,730
(engine rumbles)

1313
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:24,494
- Zoey?

1314
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:27,797
- I was gonna call you but I know how you love surprises.

1315
01:13:27,831 --> 01:13:30,786
- Is this a mirage or is this my wild child?

1316
01:13:32,002 --> 01:13:33,915
- This is a wild mirage.

1317
01:13:33,949 --> 01:13:35,686
- So tell me everything.

1318
01:13:35,722 --> 01:13:38,155
- I've already told you everything.

1319
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:39,962
- Keep going.

1320
01:13:39,997 --> 01:13:40,970
What do you hear from Travis?

1321
01:13:41,004 --> 01:13:41,804
- Travis who?

1322
01:13:43,437 --> 01:13:46,358
- Oh dear, something's never change.

1323
01:13:46,392 --> 01:13:49,138
(upbeat music)

1324
01:13:55,394 --> 01:14:00,400
- [Zoey] So you and Deke aren't still feuding are you?

1325
01:14:01,441 --> 01:14:02,172
- Deke who?

1326
01:14:03,597 --> 01:14:07,628
- Oh man, somethings never change.

1327
01:14:07,663 --> 01:14:09,402
You know what this has been going on for so long

1328
01:14:09,435 --> 01:14:11,869
I can't remember what started it.

1329
01:14:11,903 --> 01:14:14,440
- Well whatever it was you can be sure it was his fault.

1330
01:14:16,110 --> 01:14:20,350
Zoey, I have to show you something.

1331
01:14:20,385 --> 01:14:22,991
(gentle music)

1332
01:14:27,266 --> 01:14:32,307
- Mom, this is extraordinary work.

1333
01:14:32,341 --> 01:14:33,384
- It's not done yet.

1334
01:14:36,234 --> 01:14:38,389
- What gave you this idea?

1335
01:14:39,362 --> 01:14:40,717
- Oh I was blocked for so long,

1336
01:14:40,752 --> 01:14:41,969
all I could do was prep canvas

1337
01:14:42,003 --> 01:14:46,765
and clean brushes and then this beautiful old dress came,

1338
01:14:46,799 --> 01:14:48,016
instead of my rag order.

1339
01:14:49,858 --> 01:14:52,500
Don't question good fortune as your grandma used to say.

1340
01:14:54,029 --> 01:14:57,018
- I think this may be my favorite painting you're

1341
01:14:57,053 --> 01:14:57,922
ever done.

1342
01:14:58,408 --> 01:14:59,278
(engine rumbles)

1343
01:14:59,312 --> 01:15:00,251
- Okay shut it off.

1344
01:15:02,579 --> 01:15:04,456
- [Zoey] So?

1345
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:06,750
- Yeah it's your voltage regulator.

1346
01:15:06,784 --> 01:15:08,418
But I could fix that for you today.

1347
01:15:08,453 --> 01:15:10,331
Anything else that's concerning you?

1348
01:15:11,269 --> 01:15:14,084
- Well, since you brought it up.

1349
01:15:14,119 --> 01:15:16,239
- Well go ahead and ask me.

1350
01:15:16,273 --> 01:15:18,012
Turns out I'm the local genius.

1351
01:15:19,367 --> 01:15:21,800
- I have a theory about why you and mom have been

1352
01:15:21,834 --> 01:15:23,920
at each other for so long.

1353
01:15:23,954 --> 01:15:29,134
You two have some kind of weird dependency on each other.

1354
01:15:29,168 --> 01:15:31,081
I don't think either one of you would know what to do

1355
01:15:31,115 --> 01:15:32,088
if the other one weren't around.

1356
01:15:32,123 --> 01:15:33,270
Am I right?

1357
01:15:33,305 --> 01:15:34,799
- Let me tell you something.

1358
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:36,399
Part of being a genius is knowing

1359
01:15:36,432 --> 01:15:37,962
when to keep your mouth shut.

1360
01:15:37,997 --> 01:15:39,490
(clangs)

1361
01:15:39,526 --> 01:15:40,707
- Unbelievable.

1362
01:15:42,063 --> 01:15:44,914
Mom approved the survey, that's a good sign.

1363
01:15:44,948 --> 01:15:47,172
- I'll tell you what I'll fix this car for ya

1364
01:15:47,208 --> 01:15:50,996
if you promise not to mention your mother again.

1365
01:15:51,031 --> 01:15:52,525
- What mother?

1366
01:15:52,559 --> 01:15:55,202
(chattering)

1367
01:16:02,362 --> 01:16:03,300
- Laura.

1368
01:16:03,335 --> 01:16:04,968
- [Laura] Hey Deke what can I get for ya?

1369
01:16:05,002 --> 01:16:07,748
- I'll have the T bone, a coffee, mashed potatoes,

1370
01:16:07,783 --> 01:16:10,286
string beans, side of fries and onion rings,

1371
01:16:10,321 --> 01:16:12,337
that soup de jour and some bread

1372
01:16:12,372 --> 01:16:14,943
and I'll have the peach pie a la mode for desert.

1373
01:16:14,978 --> 01:16:15,881
- [Laura] Alright coming up.

1374
01:16:15,917 --> 01:16:18,419
- Hey cancel that, I just changed my mind.

1375
01:16:18,453 --> 01:16:20,157
- It's good you're going Johannsen.

1376
01:16:20,192 --> 01:16:22,173
Leaves enough food for the rest of us.

1377
01:16:24,259 --> 01:16:24,884
- Ms. Delaino--

1378
01:16:24,919 --> 01:16:25,614
- Delano.

1379
01:16:25,648 --> 01:16:26,899
- You can kiss my rusty butt.

1380
01:16:26,935 --> 01:16:29,923
- Ew, oh, I've been contaminated.

1381
01:16:29,959 --> 01:16:31,696
He reeks of WD40.

1382
01:16:31,730 --> 01:16:33,295
- I think he's cute.

1383
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:34,234
- Poo.

1384
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:38,022
(cries out)

1385
01:16:38,057 --> 01:16:38,925
Did you see that?

1386
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:39,899
He mooned me!

1387
01:16:39,934 --> 01:16:41,602
He's in violation of Judge Philips ruling

1388
01:16:41,636 --> 01:16:42,645
I should have him arrested.

1389
01:16:42,679 --> 01:16:45,147
- I hate to say so but you asked for it mom.

1390
01:16:45,182 --> 01:16:46,920
- Well I didn't ask for that.

1391
01:16:47,893 --> 01:16:49,804
Rusty butt, no kidding.

1392
01:16:51,021 --> 01:16:53,837
- [Zoey] What do I get for all this posing?

1393
01:16:53,871 --> 01:16:55,504
- [Joan] Motherly love.

1394
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:57,729
- Oh no, anything but that.

1395
01:16:59,155 --> 01:17:01,761
Oh, I gotta take a break.

1396
01:17:01,796 --> 01:17:02,839
- Two minutes.

1397
01:17:05,271 --> 01:17:06,627
- Okay two minutes.

1398
01:17:06,662 --> 01:17:07,704
(clatters)

1399
01:17:07,739 --> 01:17:08,607
Oye sorry.

1400
01:17:11,841 --> 01:17:14,760
(dramatic music)

1401
01:17:16,046 --> 01:17:17,402
Mom?

1402
01:17:17,436 --> 01:17:18,306
- [Joan] What?

1403
01:17:19,626 --> 01:17:23,414
- This, this is the dress you painted?

1404
01:17:23,449 --> 01:17:24,874
- That's it.

1405
01:17:24,909 --> 01:17:26,404
It's something isn't it?

1406
01:17:26,438 --> 01:17:28,524
- Mom I know this dress.

1407
01:17:28,558 --> 01:17:30,122
- You what?

1408
01:17:30,158 --> 01:17:31,061
- Travis...

1409
01:17:33,668 --> 01:17:36,518
Travis's dream girl married him in this dress.

1410
01:17:37,456 --> 01:17:39,020
It belonged to his aunt.

1411
01:17:41,557 --> 01:17:44,269
How in the world did this ever end up in a box of rags?

1412
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:46,980
- Zoey that can't be the same one.

1413
01:17:47,015 --> 01:17:48,822
- Mom I know it is.

1414
01:17:48,857 --> 01:17:51,985
There used to be pearls all over this bodice.

1415
01:17:53,376 --> 01:17:54,696
And the sleeves have been removed

1416
01:17:54,730 --> 01:17:56,572
but you see this?

1417
01:17:58,553 --> 01:18:00,987
Nobody blind stitches like this anymore.

1418
01:18:01,021 --> 01:18:03,281
Look at this beautiful neckline.

1419
01:18:07,555 --> 01:18:10,093
- Maybe you could restore it to it's former glory?

1420
01:18:19,304 --> 01:18:22,224
(engine rumbles)

1421
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:28,792
(door bangs)

1422
01:18:36,265 --> 01:18:37,238
- Hi.

1423
01:18:37,274 --> 01:18:38,386
- Hi Zoey.

1424
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:39,394
Here you go.

1425
01:18:39,428 --> 01:18:40,888
She's running real good now.

1426
01:18:40,922 --> 01:18:42,486
- Yay thank you.

1427
01:18:42,521 --> 01:18:44,260
- Who's the lucky groom?

1428
01:18:44,295 --> 01:18:46,692
- Oh it's not for me it's my mom's.

1429
01:18:46,727 --> 01:18:49,750
I wish I could afford to pay you something Deke.

1430
01:18:49,786 --> 01:18:51,489
- Oh Zoe that's my pleasure,

1431
01:18:51,523 --> 01:18:53,887
I live for the days when things break down.

1432
01:18:53,921 --> 01:18:56,424
(chuckles)

1433
01:18:58,266 --> 01:18:59,761
- Is she moving away then?

1434
01:19:02,299 --> 01:19:04,870
- Maybe, she hasn't decided yet.

1435
01:19:07,373 --> 01:19:10,674
Mom, Deke thinks the dress is yours.

1436
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:12,308
You should have seen the look on his face

1437
01:19:12,344 --> 01:19:14,394
when I suggested you were getting married.

1438
01:19:14,428 --> 01:19:17,349
- Well why on earth would you tell him a thing like that?

1439
01:19:17,383 --> 01:19:19,399
- You two haven't had a good fight in awhile.

1440
01:19:19,433 --> 01:19:21,692
Things are getting a little dull around here.

1441
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:24,265
He said he didn't care anyway.

1442
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:25,724
- Well of course he doesn't.

1443
01:19:28,297 --> 01:19:29,270
He said that?

1444
01:19:29,305 --> 01:19:32,363
(light hearted music)

1445
01:19:32,398 --> 01:19:37,611
(engine rumbles) (clattering)

1446
01:19:46,613 --> 01:19:47,969
- [Man] How much you want for this car?

1447
01:19:48,004 --> 01:19:52,905
(engine rumbles) (light hearted music)

1448
01:19:57,422 --> 01:20:00,168
- I don't believe it, he's finally getting rid

1449
01:20:00,204 --> 01:20:01,107
of all that junk.

1450
01:20:02,463 --> 01:20:04,931
- Hey mom, do you still want this pearl bracelet?

1451
01:20:04,965 --> 01:20:05,729
It's broken.

1452
01:20:06,807 --> 01:20:08,128
- You wanna use it for your dress?

1453
01:20:08,163 --> 01:20:09,066
I'd love you too.

1454
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:12,299
(laughing)

1455
01:20:15,044 --> 01:20:16,817
- He's doing it for you you know.

1456
01:20:16,851 --> 01:20:20,294
- Trust me Zoey someone made him an offer he can't refuse.

1457
01:20:20,328 --> 01:20:23,490
Look whatever, I don't have to look at that junk yard again.

1458
01:20:23,525 --> 01:20:27,383
- Mom, believe it, he cares about you so much

1459
01:20:27,418 --> 01:20:29,260
he swallowed his pride and gave up something

1460
01:20:29,296 --> 01:20:30,373
that's really precious to him.

1461
01:20:31,902 --> 01:20:33,778
Do you know what I would give to have someone love me

1462
01:20:33,813 --> 01:20:34,717
like that?

1463
01:20:40,555 --> 01:20:43,372
(phone ringing)

1464
01:20:48,689 --> 01:20:49,836
Delano residence.

1465
01:20:49,871 --> 01:20:51,643
- [Deke] Can I speak to Joan please?

1466
01:20:51,678 --> 01:20:53,416
- She's right here.

1467
01:20:56,024 --> 01:20:56,857
- Hello?

1468
01:20:56,892 --> 01:20:58,455
- Well I hope you'll be happy now.

1469
01:20:59,776 --> 01:21:04,886
- Deke, thank you, two words I thought I'd never say to you.

1470
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:07,006
- Yeah well could I hear them again?

1471
01:21:07,041 --> 01:21:08,327
I didn't hear 'em the first time

1472
01:21:08,362 --> 01:21:10,308
on account of being in shock.

1473
01:21:10,344 --> 01:21:11,524
- Don't push your luck.

1474
01:21:12,707 --> 01:21:15,105
- [Deke] Well, goodbye then.

1475
01:21:16,946 --> 01:21:17,989
- Goodbye.

1476
01:21:18,025 --> 01:21:19,449
- Thank you.

1477
01:21:19,483 --> 01:21:20,839
- And thank you.

1478
01:21:23,585 --> 01:21:24,906
(clatters)

1479
01:21:24,941 --> 01:21:28,208
(light hearted music)

1480
01:22:05,294 --> 01:22:06,198
- Joan.

1481
01:22:07,865 --> 01:22:09,951
If you run away and get married things aren't gonna

1482
01:22:09,986 --> 01:22:11,203
be the same around here.

1483
01:22:12,662 --> 01:22:13,670
- Who's running?

1484
01:22:13,705 --> 01:22:16,763
- You're gonna live here with your new husband?

1485
01:22:16,798 --> 01:22:18,050
- If someone asks me to marry them,

1486
01:22:19,509 --> 01:22:21,942
I wouldn't budge from this place if that's what you mean.

1487
01:22:21,977 --> 01:22:23,194
- Isn't that your dress?

1488
01:22:25,383 --> 01:22:27,086
- I couldn't get into that dress with a crowbar

1489
01:22:27,122 --> 01:22:28,338
you ridiculous man.

1490
01:22:35,671 --> 01:22:38,244
(gentle music)

1491
01:22:38,278 --> 01:22:40,189
- You know I always planned on

1492
01:22:40,225 --> 01:22:41,928
getting married myself someday.

1493
01:22:43,874 --> 01:22:44,569
- Why didn't you?

1494
01:22:45,681 --> 01:22:49,469
- Oh you know, life's little clutters.

1495
01:22:51,382 --> 01:22:55,275
But I just recently cleared out some notions

1496
01:22:55,309 --> 01:22:58,785
and now I'm afraid.

1497
01:23:01,113 --> 01:23:02,746
If I was to get down on one knee now

1498
01:23:02,782 --> 01:23:04,797
I might not be able to get up again.

1499
01:23:10,637 --> 01:23:13,661
- Deke, you're the one who gave up your jun...

1500
01:23:15,225 --> 01:23:18,735
Artifacts and on top of that you've come all the way

1501
01:23:18,769 --> 01:23:23,150
up to me, on my property, without a shotgun.

1502
01:23:25,930 --> 01:23:27,703
What's your middle name?

1503
01:23:27,737 --> 01:23:29,232
- My grandpa's name Albert.

1504
01:23:32,291 --> 01:23:37,503
- Well, Deke Albert Johannsen will you,

1505
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,583
will you...

1506
01:23:47,618 --> 01:23:48,487
- Yes.

1507
01:23:51,685 --> 01:23:53,389
- Have dinner with me?

1508
01:23:53,422 --> 01:23:55,925
(laughing)

1509
01:23:56,829 --> 01:23:58,984
- Yes I will, yes I will.

1510
01:24:01,034 --> 01:24:02,077
Miss Delano.

1511
01:24:06,734 --> 01:24:07,604
Yes.

1512
01:24:07,638 --> 01:24:10,385
(gentle music)

1513
01:24:35,583 --> 01:24:38,467
- Okay, don't look til I say so.

1514
01:24:40,971 --> 01:24:42,326
(banging)

1515
01:24:42,361 --> 01:24:43,265
Oh, be careful.

1516
01:24:44,307 --> 01:24:45,802
Kay keep your eyes shut.

1517
01:24:48,026 --> 01:24:50,042
Okay, watch yourself.

1518
01:24:51,050 --> 01:24:52,683
Keep your eyes shut.

1519
01:24:54,873 --> 01:24:56,645
Hold it. (door bangs)

1520
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:57,549
Alright.

1521
01:24:59,669 --> 01:25:01,476
Okay, open 'em.

1522
01:25:07,281 --> 01:25:09,436
- And you got a job?

1523
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:12,494
- I realized there was a reason why I couldn't hold down

1524
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:16,179
those other jobs, I didn't want those jobs

1525
01:25:17,499 --> 01:25:19,169
but I now know what I want.

1526
01:25:20,419 --> 01:25:22,505
- And that's really your car?

1527
01:25:23,756 --> 01:25:27,857
- The car, the job, and now this.

1528
01:25:27,892 --> 01:25:30,638
(gentle music)

1529
01:25:32,410 --> 01:25:34,426
So you're all out of excuses.

1530
01:25:39,363 --> 01:25:43,185
Lula, I promise to cherish you,

1531
01:25:43,915 --> 01:25:46,417
I promise to spoil you.

1532
01:25:46,451 --> 01:25:49,615
- Billy, I don't know what to say.

1533
01:25:49,650 --> 01:25:53,196
- No, no, don't say anything, let me.

1534
01:25:55,976 --> 01:25:58,166
Loving you has changed my whole life

1535
01:26:01,085 --> 01:26:03,379
and Lula I didn't change my whole life

1536
01:26:03,413 --> 01:26:05,708
so you could change your mind.

1537
01:26:07,272 --> 01:26:09,913
- Go on about the spoiling part.

1538
01:26:11,442 --> 01:26:14,050
- First can I see your knees?

1539
01:26:17,351 --> 01:26:18,985
Things are looking good.

1540
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:19,993
(giggles)

1541
01:26:20,028 --> 01:26:22,774
(gentle music)

1542
01:26:23,572 --> 01:26:24,928
- Hey I'll get the door for ya.

1543
01:26:24,963 --> 01:26:25,866
- Cheers.

1544
01:26:25,902 --> 01:26:27,153
Should have that new dark room finished

1545
01:26:27,188 --> 01:26:28,126
by the end of the week.

1546
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:30,593
- Funny that's what you said last week.

1547
01:26:30,628 --> 01:26:31,532
- Okay you got me.

1548
01:26:31,566 --> 01:26:32,436
(chuckling)

1549
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:33,340
- See ya.

1550
01:26:33,374 --> 01:26:34,244
- See ya.

1551
01:26:34,278 --> 01:26:36,711
(door thuds)

1552
01:26:40,708 --> 01:26:42,098
(knocking) (dog barking)

1553
01:26:42,133 --> 01:26:43,801
- Hey Iris!

1554
01:26:43,836 --> 01:26:46,165
Hey it's just Steve relax.

1555
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,069
(barks)

1556
01:26:47,103 --> 01:26:47,972
Stop it's Steve.

1557
01:26:51,031 --> 01:26:52,283
Zoey.

1558
01:26:52,317 --> 01:26:53,463
- Hey baby.

1559
01:26:53,498 --> 01:26:54,576
- I don't believe it.

1560
01:26:55,618 --> 01:26:56,522
- Hey you.

1561
01:26:59,373 --> 01:27:01,771
- I tried to find you, you have no idea.

1562
01:27:01,805 --> 01:27:03,057
- Hannah told me.

1563
01:27:03,092 --> 01:27:04,446
I talked to her this morning.

1564
01:27:05,629 --> 01:27:07,923
All this time I thought you were married.

1565
01:27:07,957 --> 01:27:09,348
- God no, I...

1566
01:27:10,738 --> 01:27:11,467
No.

1567
01:27:14,109 --> 01:27:15,188
Come in, please.

1568
01:27:17,759 --> 01:27:19,601
Oh hey come meet my new assistant.

1569
01:27:19,635 --> 01:27:22,277
Ah, fifth one since you and the best by far.

1570
01:27:23,806 --> 01:27:25,579
- Hey, I'm Billy.

1571
01:27:25,614 --> 01:27:26,483
- Hi.

1572
01:27:26,517 --> 01:27:28,187
- Is she the Zoey?

1573
01:27:29,125 --> 01:27:30,932
- Yeah, she's the one.

1574
01:27:31,835 --> 01:27:34,025
- Wow no wonder.

1575
01:27:35,207 --> 01:27:37,084
- And I'm the fool that let her get away.

1576
01:27:37,119 --> 01:27:39,864
- I have something to give you.

1577
01:27:46,677 --> 01:27:49,457
(gentle music)

1578
01:27:54,323 --> 01:27:55,922
I think this belongs to you.

1579
01:27:55,957 --> 01:27:58,147
(gentle music)

1580
01:27:58,181 --> 01:28:00,301
- Hey isn't that the...

1581
01:28:03,187 --> 01:28:06,211
Nah, nevermind.

1582
01:28:06,245 --> 01:28:08,400
- Billy don't you have prints to develop?

1583
01:28:09,685 --> 01:28:11,702
- Come on Iris (whistles).

1584
01:28:11,736 --> 01:28:13,752
wuz up? (barks)

1585
01:28:13,787 --> 01:28:16,463
- Zoey how did you find this?

1586
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:20,564
- Well I guess you could say it found me.

1587
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:23,172
(clattering) (barking)

1588
01:28:23,206 --> 01:28:24,111
- [Billy] Sorry.

1589
01:28:26,438 --> 01:28:30,505
- You have no idea how many times I think about that day,

1590
01:28:30,539 --> 01:28:33,251
with you and the dress.

1591
01:28:33,286 --> 01:28:34,155
- Really?

1592
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:34,920
- Oh yeah.

1593
01:28:36,831 --> 01:28:41,072
It's even more beautiful than I remember it being

1594
01:28:43,608 --> 01:28:45,208
and so are you Zoey.

1595
01:28:47,849 --> 01:28:48,822
So are you.

1596
01:28:51,672 --> 01:28:52,541
Come here.

1597
01:28:52,576 --> 01:28:55,495
(romantic music)

1598
01:30:26,558 --> 01:30:31,356
(lid thuds) (clicks)

1599
01:30:37,195 --> 01:30:39,871
(gentle music)
