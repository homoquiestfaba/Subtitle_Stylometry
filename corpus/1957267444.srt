1
00:00:02,984 --> 00:00:05,680
That's what they said in the old country.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,124
And then look what happened.

3
00:00:07,983 --> 00:00:12,328
Marv, he's powerful, he's famous.

4
00:00:12,348 --> 00:00:13,591
Then he goes down.

5
00:00:14,569 --> 00:00:16,336
That's how life is.

6
00:00:26,097 --> 00:00:27,473
There's always been a neighborhood

7
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:29,735
on Coventry Street.

8
00:00:29,755 --> 00:00:34,761
You had vegetable stands,
bakeries, kosher chicken market.

9
00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:38,753
And for 28 years, you want a
blintz and a cup of coffee?

10
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:41,440
Marv's was the place to go.

11
00:00:42,287 --> 00:00:43,942
Only place after eight at night.

12
00:00:50,536 --> 00:00:53,630
But then one day the young kids moved in.

13
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,201
The hippies come and they do their thing.

14
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,233
The curious just watched, the pessimists-

15
00:00:57,253 --> 00:00:59,131
- Most of 'em were good.

16
00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:02,330
Some not so good, but what can I say?

17
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,619
They were different.

18
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,039

19
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:25,047

Fuck you and fuck this place!

24
00:01:43,622 --> 00:01:45,928
Just about every gal on Coventry Street

25
00:01:45,948 --> 00:01:48,426
had worked at Marv's.

26
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:51,352
Sooner or later, they all walk away.

27
00:01:52,454 --> 00:01:55,488

28

32

Turnover was so high because well,

33
00:02:11,723 --> 00:02:15,254
Marv just couldn't stay
away from the waitresses.

34
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:17,970
Only Sylvia had stuck it out.

35
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,410
Will you people ever
see that uniform again?

36
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,612
What do you want from me, Gracie?

37
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:25,168
We needed help, I hired a waitress.

38
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:26,683
I got your chickens.

39
00:02:26,703 --> 00:02:27,704
Ah.

40
00:02:29,637 --> 00:02:30,451
What are these for?

41
00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:32,992
These are for my new
sandwich, the Miraculous Marvel,

42
00:02:33,012 --> 00:02:35,726
one bite of this thing and
they're gonna line the streets.

43
00:02:35,746 --> 00:02:37,927
That's what you said about the dough maker.

44
00:02:37,947 --> 00:02:38,808
That was different.

45
00:02:38,828 --> 00:02:39,809
Don't listen to her.

46
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,245
Take these to the kitchen
and I'll give you a check.

47
00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:46,614
Mr. Grunfield said that
I should only take cash.

48
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:47,898
What?

49
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,220
He said that your checks

50
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,424
was only good for wiping your tuchus with.

51
00:02:53,444 --> 00:02:54,922
He said that about me?

52
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:56,106
God damn trader.

53
00:02:56,126 --> 00:02:58,419
You know, if it wasn't for me,
he wouldn't have a business.

54
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,253
He'll still be picking-

55
00:02:59,273 --> 00:03:01,630
- How Marv stayed
in business was a mystery.

56
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,422
It seemed that whenever he
made, he'd spend on the horses.

57
00:03:06,442 --> 00:03:09,470
For God sakes, Gracie, my old cousin.

58
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,176
I gave him his start and
this is how he treats me?

59
00:03:13,164 --> 00:03:14,165
You'll see.

60
00:03:14,866 --> 00:03:16,696
Tell your uncle I'll be giving him checks

61
00:03:16,716 --> 00:03:19,911
and I don't care what he does with 'em.

62
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:22,974
So we're going up to her place.

63
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,736
I should have known from the moment

64
00:03:24,756 --> 00:03:26,627
that I was on the stairway that I was in

65
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:28,490
for an unusual evening.

66
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,811
Then one thing leads to another,

67
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:32,535
hanky panky, heavy pet,
the clothes are coming off.

68
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:35,125
There we are stark naked.

69
00:03:35,145 --> 00:03:36,728
You know what she says to me?

70
00:03:36,748 --> 00:03:39,451
Grunfield won't take Marv's checks.

71
00:03:39,471 --> 00:03:41,831
Nah, she says, Grunfield?

72
00:03:41,851 --> 00:03:44,556
What's Grunfield got to do with it?

73
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:45,837
Where was I?

74
00:03:45,857 --> 00:03:50,863
Oh yeah, she says, I like to wrestle naked.

75
00:03:51,012 --> 00:03:52,775
Then before I have a chance to ask-

76
00:03:52,795 --> 00:03:54,544
- Oh, I forgot to mention,

77
00:03:54,564 --> 00:03:57,950
me, Morty and Yosha were
Marv's steadiest customers.

78
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,292
She's naked.

79
00:03:59,312 --> 00:04:00,126
What's that?

80
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:01,475
It's for Marv.

81
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:03,836
I didn't finish filling in the G.

82
00:04:03,856 --> 00:04:05,348
I ran out of green pen.

83
00:04:05,368 --> 00:04:07,350
Can't I ever finished a story around here

84
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,792
without being interrupted?

85
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:09,812
I wasn't interrupting.

86
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,376
You asked me what it is.

87
00:04:12,846 --> 00:04:15,449
- What'd you charge him?
- I gave him a bargain.

88
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:17,176
Why do you let him
penny pinch you like that?

89
00:04:17,196 --> 00:04:19,342
He's not penny pinching me.

90
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:20,997
I just gave him a bargain.

91
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:23,336
What do you think?

92
00:04:24,117 --> 00:04:25,150
What's that supposed to mean?

93
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,240
You can't afford the
lox, you're not welcome?

94
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,772
That's a classism, man.

95
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:30,564
He has to run a business.

96
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:32,136
Oh, he's doing plenty of business.

97
00:04:32,156 --> 00:04:33,086
Look at him.

98
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,508
All the food he shoves in his belly

99
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:36,240
could feed a hundred starving
children in Bangladesh.

100
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,332
It doesn't matter what
he puts in his belly.

101
00:04:38,352 --> 00:04:39,963
Grunfield won't take his checks anymore.

102
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:41,746
That doesn't mean you have to let him

103
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:43,047
penny pinch you like that.

104
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:44,619
He's not penny pinching me.

105
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,967
I just gave him a bargain.

106
00:04:45,987 --> 00:04:47,453
Oh, so you gave him a bargain

107
00:04:47,473 --> 00:04:48,603
and we sit here for an hour

108
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:50,533
waiting for a lousy cup of coffee?

109
00:04:50,553 --> 00:04:52,429
That's how it is.

110
00:04:53,317 --> 00:04:57,342
First goes to coffee, then the corned beef,

111
00:04:57,362 --> 00:04:59,657
then they take away the business.

112
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:09,257
Susan Bennett was new to Cleveland.

113
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:14,359
Her first time away from home.

114
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:16,552
It's a fast track so give me Hot Tamale

115
00:05:16,572 --> 00:05:17,973
in the fifth at Santa Anita.

116
00:05:19,365 --> 00:05:21,641
Give me Lefty in the third at Hialeah

117
00:05:21,661 --> 00:05:24,690
and Cleopatra in the third at Pimlico.

118
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,862
A century note on each.

119
00:05:27,352 --> 00:05:28,354
You got that?

120
00:05:30,356 --> 00:05:31,357
Yeah.

121
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:40,448
I wanted to see about getting a job here.

122
00:05:40,468 --> 00:05:43,169
Got any restaurant experience?

123
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:44,591
The Dairy Barn.

124
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,542
You good with people?

125
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:48,185
I don't know.

126
00:05:48,205 --> 00:05:49,275
Yeah, I guess so.

127
00:05:49,296 --> 00:05:51,068
You went to school?

128
00:05:51,088 --> 00:05:53,050
College, I'm a freshman.

129
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,222
Ah, college girl, huh?

130
00:05:55,242 --> 00:05:57,274
You know, all my kid
brothers went to college,

131
00:05:57,294 --> 00:05:58,738
one of them is a doctor now.

132
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,194
Head of gastro.

133
00:06:00,214 --> 00:06:01,216
Oh.

134
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,812
So about the job?

135
00:06:05,552 --> 00:06:08,530
Yeah, sure, you can start tonight.

136
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,108
She can't work in those clothes.

137
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:12,816
You take care of it.

138
00:06:13,859 --> 00:06:15,360
The ceiling's leaking again.

139
00:06:20,264 --> 00:06:23,516
Do you have a skirt and a plain blouse?

140
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:26,668
Well, it's almost plain.

141
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,879
It'll do, just change and hurry back.

142
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:32,450
Your shift started an hour ago.

143
00:06:42,997 --> 00:06:45,353
I don't believe this.

144
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:47,725
Lenny replastered this last week.

145
00:06:47,745 --> 00:06:50,579
I let him eat here a whole week for free.

146
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:52,433
It ain't the plaster that's your problem.

147
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,693
It's the people upstairs.

148
00:06:54,713 --> 00:06:57,550
They got a swimming pool
up there or something.

149
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,482
Why don't you have Horowitz
do something about this?

150
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,283
He won't do anything.

151
00:07:02,452 --> 00:07:04,953
Maybe if you paid the rent he would.

152
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:06,795
Why do you think I don't pay it?

153
00:07:06,816 --> 00:07:08,701
He never does anything.

154
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:20,910
That does it.

155
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,187
Why did you hire that girl?

156
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:29,689
We needed somebody.

157
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:31,411
But I'm supposed to do the hiring.

158
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:35,212
So I hired her, you train her.

159
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:46,256
- Hey.
- Alright.

160
00:07:56,755 --> 00:07:58,642
How come he always has food?

161
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:01,362
He knows how to behave himself.

162
00:08:09,462 --> 00:08:11,603
Hey, what about us, huh?

163
00:08:21,183 --> 00:08:22,795
Susan had an apartment

164
00:08:22,815 --> 00:08:26,089
right down the alley
from Marv's with Faith,

165
00:08:26,109 --> 00:08:29,229
a girl she knew from back home.

166
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,269
It must have been nice for Susan

167
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:42,879
to have a friend in such
a strange new place.

168
00:08:44,968 --> 00:08:48,201
Do you have a plain blouse?

169
00:08:48,221 --> 00:08:50,293
I'm working at Marv's.

170
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:53,066
How about my white halter top?

171
00:08:53,086 --> 00:08:54,989
How about just going in your undies?

172
00:09:05,989 --> 00:09:07,941
Excuse me, what do you want me to do?

173
00:09:09,052 --> 00:09:11,696
If you had not taken your
sweet old time coming back

174
00:09:11,716 --> 00:09:12,906
there would have been time to train.

175
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:15,370
- I'm sorry.
- See this pad?

176
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,132
That's your station.

177
00:09:17,152 --> 00:09:18,152
Go take orders.

178
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:22,359
What's up, man?

179
00:09:32,808 --> 00:09:35,630
I'm gonna take two bagels, extra jam.

180
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,035
Make it strawberry jam.

181
00:09:41,937 --> 00:09:42,818
Is that everything?

182
00:09:42,838 --> 00:09:43,839
No, hold on.

183
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:54,079
Hot beef tongue and eggs?

184
00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:55,099
Waitress!

185
00:09:56,441 --> 00:09:58,474
What's she doing over
there, shooting craps?

186
00:09:58,494 --> 00:09:59,565
Do you want me to come back later?

187
00:09:59,585 --> 00:10:00,776
No, hold on a second.

188
00:10:00,796 --> 00:10:02,068
Okay, if you're getting beef tongue

189
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:03,399
then I'm going to get blitzes.

190
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:05,672
Okay, make it three blueberry blintzes,

191
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:06,612
side of sour cream,

192
00:10:06,632 --> 00:10:08,234
make it two sides of sour cream.

193
00:10:09,786 --> 00:10:11,213
- Blueberry?
- Blintzes.

194
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,869
And don't forget the sour cream.

195
00:10:20,145 --> 00:10:21,148
Waitress, huh?

196
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:30,680
How are you?

197
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,029
Oh, I love these, this is your color.

198
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,791
Do you believe in love at first sight

199
00:10:34,811 --> 00:10:36,892
or should I walk by again?

200
00:10:40,938 --> 00:10:42,115
You look great.

201
00:10:57,885 --> 00:11:00,808
I ordered a cheese blintz,
not a blueberry blintz.

202
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:03,551
I don't even eat blueberries,
I'm allergic to 'em.

203
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:05,792
Sorry, I'm not sure what happened.

204
00:11:05,812 --> 00:11:08,066
- Morty, shush.
- Don't shush me!

205
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:09,377
We've been waiting 40 minutes,

206
00:11:09,397 --> 00:11:11,286
she's trying to poison me with blueberries.

207
00:11:11,306 --> 00:11:12,889
No, you understand, there's no cheese.

208
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:14,439
Waitress!

209
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:15,928
I'm not paying that bill.

210
00:11:15,948 --> 00:11:16,949
Waitress!

211
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:19,517
No, she had no cheese on the sandwich

212
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:21,472
and you gotta fix this now.

213
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,805
Sandwich, no cheese.

214
00:11:32,971 --> 00:11:34,545
Nice haircut, Sylvia.

215
00:11:47,653 --> 00:11:50,423
Those two pay in
advance, that's the policy.

216
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,062
But I just got here, how
was I supposed to know?

217
00:11:53,082 --> 00:11:54,944
That's always been the policy.

218
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,357
Well, Helen was as big
as a Caterpillar tractor.

219
00:11:57,377 --> 00:12:00,107
She had muscles and moves
like a cat, you know?

220
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,002
So we're talking nice and soft, see,

221
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:04,371
and she says would you like
to come up to my place?

222
00:12:10,241 --> 00:12:12,192
Grunfield's Market was just

223
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:14,111
down the block from Marv's.

224
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:17,135
Best grocery chickens in Cleveland.

225
00:12:17,155 --> 00:12:20,791
And we are from the
Coventry Friends Association.

226
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:21,879
But not everyone was impressed.

227
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:22,713
You've heard of us, yeah,

228
00:12:22,733 --> 00:12:24,572
we're a grassroots organization-

229
00:12:24,592 --> 00:12:27,708
- Brent's father was a famous judge

230
00:12:27,728 --> 00:12:29,589
and Brent wanted to
follow in his footsteps.

231
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:30,917
Rest of the neighborhood.

232
00:12:30,937 --> 00:12:33,104
I think that explains the jacket

233
00:12:33,124 --> 00:12:34,615
and the fancy hairstyle.

234
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:38,622
Noticed a bit of a stench.

235
00:12:38,642 --> 00:12:41,248
It's the odor... An odor?

236
00:12:41,268 --> 00:12:43,324
You're here to complain about an odor?

237
00:12:43,344 --> 00:12:45,286
It's nothing personal,
really, Mr. Grunfield-

238
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,089
- Listen, you want to clean up some place,

239
00:12:48,109 --> 00:12:50,885
go see my cousin Marv five doors down.

240
00:12:52,014 --> 00:12:53,015
Good day.

241
00:13:02,755 --> 00:13:04,446
Hello, Manny.

242
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:05,908
Benny, could you believe?

243
00:13:05,928 --> 00:13:07,369
These people come in and want me

244
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:09,272
to clean up a chicken odor.

245
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:11,447
- A chicken odor?
- A chicken odor.

246
00:13:13,046 --> 00:13:13,915
They want to complain,

247
00:13:13,935 --> 00:13:16,088
they should complain on Marv, not me.

248
00:13:16,108 --> 00:13:17,870
He's the one stays open all night

249
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,132
and brings all the cooks
into the neighborhood.

250
00:13:20,152 --> 00:13:22,795
- He has to do business.
- Some business.

251
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,843
He begs me I should give
him my best chickens at cost

252
00:13:25,863 --> 00:13:28,376
so he can make his
farshtinkener sandwiches.

253
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:30,123
And then you know what he does.

254
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,907
He writes me two bad checks, two in a row!

255
00:13:33,927 --> 00:13:36,019
Pretty soon I don't have a business.

256
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:38,471
Davis the baker, Sam the fish man,

257
00:13:38,491 --> 00:13:40,493
my own customers, they're gone.

258
00:13:40,513 --> 00:13:42,315
They all went up to the mall.

259
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:45,411
The cooks keep coming,
I'll have to go there too.

260
00:13:47,131 --> 00:13:49,182
There are chickens in the mall?

261
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:50,717
Who knows, who knows?

262
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:06,664
Hey, hey, whoa.

263
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:11,670
You guys have to pay in
advance if you want anything.

264
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,800
What?

265
00:14:14,328 --> 00:14:16,478
You skipped out without paying last night.

266
00:14:16,498 --> 00:14:19,604
But we put the money
right under this ashtray.

267
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:22,700
And with a big old tip too, didn't we?

268
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,567
Hey, can you fry these up for us?

269
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,056
Alright!

270
00:14:33,076 --> 00:14:35,271
No, one a piece.

271
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,351
What is it?

272
00:14:36,371 --> 00:14:40,626
The Marvel, corn beef,
tongue, chicken breast,

273
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,388
chopped liver, eggs, onion

274
00:14:43,408 --> 00:14:45,311
and kosher chicken shmaltz.

275
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:47,787
Delicious, isn't it?

276
00:14:50,102 --> 00:14:51,707
Now I've seen 'em in China.

277
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:53,238
I've seen 'em in India.

278
00:14:53,258 --> 00:14:55,321
I've seen 'em in France, even Japan,

279
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:58,634
but never have I seen
ones that were freckled.

280
00:14:58,654 --> 00:15:00,368
These were phenomenal.

281
00:15:00,388 --> 00:15:02,229
So before you can say-

282
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:04,984
- Grunfield gave me a whole chicken today.

283
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,439
Try one.

284
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:18,430
I'm so... hungry.

285
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:34,034
You can have this back, Marv, thanks.

286
00:16:00,971 --> 00:16:01,974
Hey.

287
00:16:09,483 --> 00:16:12,389
Some guy in a dress is stealing my food.

288
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:14,482
A guy in a dress?

289
00:16:14,502 --> 00:16:15,608
Excuse me, guys.

290
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,591
Listen, Marv, you know I'm president

291
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,425
of the Coventry Friends Association now?

292
00:16:21,445 --> 00:16:24,360
Well I have to tell you
we have been receiving

293
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,087
numerous complaints from the
community about your operation

294
00:16:27,107 --> 00:16:28,949
and we've come up with a few suggestions.

295
00:16:28,969 --> 00:16:30,772
One is to limit your hours.

296
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:32,877
- Limit my hours?
- Yeah.

297
00:16:32,897 --> 00:16:33,909
You must be joking.

298
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:34,743
No-

299
00:16:34,763 --> 00:16:37,935
- I tell you what, the coffee's on me.

300
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,954
Oh, you can have another free Marvel.

301
00:16:41,942 --> 00:16:42,854
How about that?

302
00:16:42,874 --> 00:16:46,021
No, I don't want this, I'm
trying to make a point, Marv.

303
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,234
Everything's gonna be all right.

304
00:16:47,254 --> 00:16:50,845
- I don't want this.
- Don't worry about it.

305
00:17:07,743 --> 00:17:09,603
Your pain kind of moving away?

306
00:17:09,623 --> 00:17:11,251
You're working too hard.

307
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:13,223
Don't get jealous, I'll get to you later.

308
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:16,243
There we are, feel it.

309
00:17:16,263 --> 00:17:17,147
You feel any better?

310
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:20,644
Now speaking of someone who
has tension in their body.

311
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,826
- Turn around, turn around.
- What are you doing?

312
00:17:21,846 --> 00:17:23,649
Oh relax, it's called a massage.

313
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:24,821
Don't worry, it's fine.

314
00:17:26,334 --> 00:17:28,230
Tension, tension, tension.

315
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:31,604
That's not good when
you tense up like that.

316
00:17:31,624 --> 00:17:36,159
Susan, come on over, I
have something for you.

317
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:37,604
For me?

318
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:39,191
Of course for you.

319
00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:41,250
Come, sit with us.

320
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,711
Bring your books with you.

321
00:17:42,731 --> 00:17:44,459
And we get into conversation.

322
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:46,992
So on this one occasion
the next thing I know

323
00:17:47,012 --> 00:17:49,005
they're inviting me to dinner.

324
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:50,708
Well, I can't turn that down because

325
00:17:50,728 --> 00:17:53,257
you know, a lot of those Italians cook.

326
00:17:53,277 --> 00:17:55,507
Then I begin to notice every time I'm there

327
00:17:55,527 --> 00:17:58,537
how Helen's chair is
closer and closer to mine.

328
00:17:58,557 --> 00:18:01,683
- How about some coffee?
- No thanks.

329
00:18:01,703 --> 00:18:03,322
How about a tea biscuit?

330
00:18:03,342 --> 00:18:04,684
They're very good.

331
00:18:04,704 --> 00:18:06,357
Thanks, I already ate.

332
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:08,345
- I gotta go.
- So soon?

333
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:10,137
Yeah, I got a hair appointment.

334
00:18:11,887 --> 00:18:14,224
- Hope it comes out well.
- Yeah.

335
00:18:20,463 --> 00:18:24,418
I painted this a few years
ago from a magazine cover

336
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,627
but it looks a lot like you.

337
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:33,376
Yeah, I guess maybe,
maybe in the eyes a little.

338
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,387
You like it?

339
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:41,084
Yeah, it's really great.

340
00:18:42,814 --> 00:18:43,816
Here.

341
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:47,736
Thanks.

342
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:06,647
It's always hard part
that used to a new job.

343
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,551
People are hard to get along with.

344
00:19:08,571 --> 00:19:10,594
Don't worry about it.

345
00:19:10,614 --> 00:19:13,456
You'll get used to 'em and
they'll get used to you.

346
00:19:13,476 --> 00:19:16,239
I just don't think that Grace likes me.

347
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:17,260
Marv.

348
00:19:17,982 --> 00:19:19,130
I don't think that she dislikes you.

349
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,285
It's pretty hard for her
to accept anybody, I think.

350
00:19:22,305 --> 00:19:25,705
She's worried about her own position.

351
00:19:27,275 --> 00:19:28,470
He really eats a lot.

352
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:32,044
Yeah, well, he was in the camps.

353
00:19:32,064 --> 00:19:36,562
It's like when you're trying
to make up for lost sleep.

354
00:19:36,582 --> 00:19:40,179
He's trying to make up for lost food.

355
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:41,314
You just can't do it.

356
00:19:43,925 --> 00:19:44,927
What now?

357
00:19:47,137 --> 00:19:48,140
What?

358
00:19:50,035 --> 00:19:51,900
That waitress you hired has got to go.

359
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,731
She doesn't do any work.

360
00:19:53,751 --> 00:19:57,500
Gracie, I'm trying to make
something very special here

361
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,709
and I keep getting interrupted.

362
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:03,805
Maybe I'm the one that should leave.

363
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,251
Gracie.

364
00:20:11,997 --> 00:20:13,650
Listen to this.

365
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,864
I got plans for this place.

366
00:20:15,884 --> 00:20:17,307
Listen, I've had this idea,

367
00:20:17,327 --> 00:20:19,641
I'm gonna expand this place
into a cocktail lounge.

368
00:20:19,661 --> 00:20:21,173
I'm going to have cocktail waitresses

369
00:20:21,193 --> 00:20:23,134
and we're gonna have
them wear these costumes.

370
00:20:23,154 --> 00:20:23,969
What kind of costumes?

371
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,204
Cocktail waitress costumes, nothing,

372
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:28,155
something that's nice.

373
00:20:28,175 --> 00:20:29,569
Something fancy.

374
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:31,372
Who's gonna hire them?

375
00:20:31,392 --> 00:20:35,143
Only one person, you.

376
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,766
What about Ruth?

377
00:20:38,786 --> 00:20:40,666
Well, if this thing works,

378
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:43,344
I'll have enough money to take care of her.

379
00:20:43,364 --> 00:20:46,073
I can get a divorce and then we can,

380
00:20:47,683 --> 00:20:48,708
Gracie, look at me.

381
00:20:49,586 --> 00:20:51,943
And then there'll just be the two of us.

382
00:20:52,872 --> 00:20:53,874
Okay.

383
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:58,663
Oh, stay right here.

384
00:20:58,683 --> 00:20:59,684
Don't move.

385
00:21:01,577 --> 00:21:02,579
Don't move!

386
00:21:10,064 --> 00:21:11,066
Hold it up.

387
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,441
What's this for?

388
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:16,875
I wanted to wear it when
we open the cocktail lounge.

389
00:21:16,895 --> 00:21:17,897
Hold it up.

390
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,584
Oh my God.

391
00:21:21,604 --> 00:21:23,330
You look beautiful.

392
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:26,347
You are so mm.

393
00:21:30,771 --> 00:21:31,904
Oh.

394
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,570
What am I gonna do with you?

395
00:21:37,474 --> 00:21:38,892
I have to work.

396
00:21:51,892 --> 00:21:53,645
Alison, I love you!

397
00:21:54,736 --> 00:21:55,930
Go to hell, Doug.

398
00:22:00,084 --> 00:22:02,990
Hey, we're having a party
at Cumberland Meadows tonight.

399
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:05,894
No, it's true, man.

400
00:22:05,914 --> 00:22:07,408
Bring all your friends.

401
00:22:07,428 --> 00:22:09,114
Tonight at Cumberland Meadows.

402
00:22:28,106 --> 00:22:30,694
Man, I need a woman.

403
00:22:32,674 --> 00:22:33,676
Damn that house.

404
00:22:36,582 --> 00:22:37,583
Got any more wine?

405
00:22:43,925 --> 00:22:47,464
No money, no spirits, no food, no reefer.

406
00:22:48,413 --> 00:22:50,166
Man, how are we gonna have a party?

407
00:22:59,974 --> 00:23:00,976
Marv.

408
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,275
He looked at me like I felt like somebody

409
00:23:05,295 --> 00:23:06,559
on the cover of a novel.

410
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:09,402
He was so cute.

411
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:11,044
I've seen him with some other girls

412
00:23:11,064 --> 00:23:15,694
but I'm not really sure if
he has a steady girlfriend.

413
00:23:15,714 --> 00:23:18,719
There's only one way to find out.

414
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:19,740
How?

415
00:23:23,197 --> 00:23:26,178
- Seduce him.
- Seduce him?

416
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:28,447
He doesn't even look at me.

417
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:30,721
That's not surprising.

418
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:32,032
What do you mean?

419
00:23:32,052 --> 00:23:34,267
You're like an open book.

420
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,720
You're too honest.

421
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,393
What's wrong with being honest?

422
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:40,829
Guys don't like it.

423
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:44,399
You've gotta act more mysterious.

424
00:23:45,478 --> 00:23:46,703
Like you don't care.

425
00:23:49,265 --> 00:23:50,544
Put on an act.

426
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:53,599
I can't do that.

427
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:55,020
Then some other girl will.

428
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,850
Try these on.

429
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,483
Not bad.

430
00:24:27,463 --> 00:24:30,090
Now you have to figure out
what else you're going to wear.

431
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,794
You didn't refill the
ketchup bottles last night.

432
00:24:43,814 --> 00:24:45,207
I didn't know what was supposed to.

433
00:24:45,227 --> 00:24:47,184
I shouldn't have to tell you everything.

434
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:54,766
Jesus, Gracie, you didn't
have to snap at her like that.

435
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:55,636
It's her first week.

436
00:24:55,656 --> 00:24:57,199
I suppose you like her or something.

437
00:24:57,219 --> 00:24:58,791
Gracie, please don't start.

438
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:00,724
Horowitz called.

439
00:25:00,744 --> 00:25:03,359
He's giving us one week to
catch up on all the rent

440
00:25:03,379 --> 00:25:05,807
or he's serving us with eviction papers.

441
00:25:11,114 --> 00:25:13,849
Horowitz is throwing
Marv out of the building.

442
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:14,985
Who told you that?

443
00:25:15,836 --> 00:25:18,529
I heard Grace talking.

444
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:19,870
That woman is a worry wart.

445
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:22,616
You know what she needs is a little.

446
00:25:22,636 --> 00:25:24,749
Morty, shush,

447
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:26,581
we're in mixed company.

448
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:30,273
A man worked hard all his
life, then they put him out?

449
00:25:31,651 --> 00:25:32,766
That's how it is.

450
00:25:43,093 --> 00:25:45,649
You going somewhere
special tonight or something?

451
00:25:46,681 --> 00:25:48,302
No.

452
00:25:48,323 --> 00:25:50,054
Well you're all dolled up.

453
00:25:50,075 --> 00:25:52,891
Morty, shush, let her study.

454
00:25:52,911 --> 00:25:54,363
Would you stop shushing me?

455
00:25:55,463 --> 00:25:57,131
Oh God Trotsky.

456
00:26:00,234 --> 00:26:02,397
Should call it history
of western imperialism.

457
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:04,993
I can't believe you actually
pay to get brainwashed.

458
00:26:05,013 --> 00:26:06,896
I'm not paying, I got a scholarship.

459
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:08,880
Smart gal, she got a scholarship.

460
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,222
You know why you're studying this stuff?

461
00:26:10,242 --> 00:26:12,747
So I can do well on the exam?

462
00:26:12,767 --> 00:26:13,769
Why?

463
00:26:15,562 --> 00:26:16,377
I don't know.

464
00:26:16,397 --> 00:26:18,704
I just, I want to do well.

465
00:26:18,724 --> 00:26:19,740
She'll do well.

466
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,953
She'll meet a nice man.

467
00:26:20,973 --> 00:26:22,124
He'll make good money.

468
00:26:22,144 --> 00:26:24,348
- Well, that's not exactly-
- Money, money, money.

469
00:26:24,368 --> 00:26:26,152
It's all this corrupt
society ever thinks about.

470
00:26:26,172 --> 00:26:28,326
What's wrong with a little capitalism?

471
00:26:28,346 --> 00:26:30,450
Man wants to sell me a tea biscuit,

472
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,703
I like them so I buy it.

473
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,175
Well it's not that you like them.

474
00:26:33,195 --> 00:26:34,347
But I do like them.

475
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:36,208
No, you don't like them.

476
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:37,422
You think you like them

477
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:39,857
because the pigs of capitalism
have brainwashed you.

478
00:26:39,877 --> 00:26:41,289
Now in a Marxist society-

479
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:43,784
- You know I was at one of
them Communist rallies once,

480
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:45,657
some dame invited me.

481
00:26:45,677 --> 00:26:47,698
Boy, did she have a nice rack.

482
00:26:47,718 --> 00:26:49,966
I wasn't talking about the Communist party.

483
00:26:49,986 --> 00:26:51,259
I'm talking about Marxism.

484
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,626
Some Russian gal, she told
me she stood in long lines

485
00:26:55,646 --> 00:26:57,924
for hours just to buy a banana.

486
00:26:57,944 --> 00:26:59,393
They don't have bananas in Russia.

487
00:26:59,413 --> 00:27:00,294
Sure they do.

488
00:27:00,314 --> 00:27:01,757
They ship them in from Havana.

489
00:27:01,777 --> 00:27:03,731
I wasn't talking about bananas!

490
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:06,499
Oops, I gotta go.

491
00:27:21,237 --> 00:27:23,136
What can I get for you?

492
00:27:23,156 --> 00:27:25,429
How about an iced tea and a bagel.

493
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:29,109
Got to make that 75 cent minimum.

494
00:27:57,874 --> 00:27:58,687
Oh hi.

495
00:27:58,707 --> 00:27:59,869
Where you going?

496
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:04,589
You, uh, Gracie tells me
you're doing a great job.

497
00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:05,982
Really?

498
00:28:06,002 --> 00:28:08,213
Yeah, you got a way with people.

499
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:10,702
Everybody likes you.

500
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:11,652
Thanks.

501
00:28:11,672 --> 00:28:13,453
You know, if you keep this up,

502
00:28:13,473 --> 00:28:16,259
maybe, this is no promise but

503
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:19,847
I could make you my head hostess.

504
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:21,869
I don't really.

505
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,331
Ooh, come on, baby!

506
00:28:30,351 --> 00:28:31,261
I better go.

507
00:28:31,281 --> 00:28:32,770
Where you going?

508
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,560
I gotta get upstairs.

509
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,582
Sure, okay.

510
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,876
If you gotta go, you gotta go.

511
00:29:08,555 --> 00:29:09,555
Hey baby.

512
00:29:17,401 --> 00:29:19,669
I hit the jackpot tonight.

513
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,417
You gonna let these roughnecks stay?

514
00:29:22,437 --> 00:29:24,277
Of course, they're paying customers.

515
00:29:24,297 --> 00:29:26,387
But I don't like the way
they're treating the waitress.

516
00:29:26,407 --> 00:29:27,688
- They can handle it.
- But Marv-

517
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:30,066
- I gotta do what's good for business.

518
00:29:30,086 --> 00:29:32,386
It's the deadbeats who sit
here all night sipping coffee

519
00:29:32,406 --> 00:29:33,557
I gotta worry about it.

520
00:29:42,054 --> 00:29:44,053
Come back anytime, guys.

521
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,430
Hey, Marv-man.

522
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,648
What?

523
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:54,746
What do you troublemakers want?

524
00:29:54,766 --> 00:29:56,267
We need to talk.

525
00:30:03,783 --> 00:30:08,523
Alright, you see, there's
gonna be this, well,

526
00:30:08,543 --> 00:30:11,495
kind of an orgy tonight
at Cumberland Meadows.

527
00:30:12,402 --> 00:30:14,264
- Orgy?
- Yeah.

528
00:30:14,284 --> 00:30:16,896
There's gonna be a lot of girls there.

529
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:18,884
Girls, huh?

530
00:30:18,904 --> 00:30:20,962
Well yeah and see the thing
is we need to get these girls

531
00:30:20,982 --> 00:30:22,511
a little loosened up, you know?

532
00:30:22,531 --> 00:30:26,481
So I was hoping, you know,
someone would do the catering.

533
00:30:26,501 --> 00:30:30,041
Well I'd like to, but I
can't leave Gracie here alone

534
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,991
to run the place, poor woman.

535
00:30:32,011 --> 00:30:33,731
Marianne said she'd be there.

536
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:36,361
Oh and the new waitress,
she has a crush on you, man.

537
00:30:36,381 --> 00:30:38,861
- Susan?
- Yeah, Susan.

538
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:41,931
She's kind of shy, but you know,

539
00:30:41,951 --> 00:30:44,463
all work and no play makes Marv a dull boy.

540
00:30:45,459 --> 00:30:48,173
Where'd you say this
party was supposed to be?

541
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:52,139
What are you doing?

542
00:30:53,503 --> 00:30:54,962
Catering a party.

543
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,164
What party?

544
00:30:58,184 --> 00:31:00,601
Oh, some party, that's all.

545
00:31:02,426 --> 00:31:04,488
Oh, you'll need help, I should go with you.

546
00:31:04,508 --> 00:31:08,327
Gracie, if you come with me,
who's gonna mind the store?

547
00:31:08,347 --> 00:31:09,470
It'll fall apart.

548
00:31:17,447 --> 00:31:18,766
So where is this party?

549
00:31:18,786 --> 00:31:23,098
Gracie, it's, I don't know.

550
00:31:23,118 --> 00:31:25,017
You're catering a party,
you should know where it's at.

551
00:31:25,037 --> 00:31:26,148
I know where it is,

552
00:31:26,168 --> 00:31:28,534
It's in Shaker Heights somewhere.

553
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:30,447
You're up to something.

554
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:33,014
I'm up to something, all right.

555
00:31:33,034 --> 00:31:36,626
I'm up to working 24 hours
a day, seven days a week.

556
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:37,715
That's what I'm up to.

557
00:31:37,735 --> 00:31:39,576
I'm up to never having a day off,

558
00:31:39,596 --> 00:31:42,275
the one who's responsible
for anything that goes wrong.

559
00:31:42,295 --> 00:31:45,078
I killed four rats last week.

560
00:31:46,815 --> 00:31:48,105
What rats?

561
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:49,154
In the basement?

562
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:51,015
I killed four of them.

563
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:52,215
You didn't tell me about that?

564
00:31:52,235 --> 00:31:53,405
Well, how could I tell you?

565
00:31:53,425 --> 00:31:55,004
It's too disgusting.

566
00:31:55,024 --> 00:31:56,754
I killed them with a broom.

567
00:31:56,774 --> 00:31:58,174
Crushed them.

568
00:31:58,194 --> 00:31:59,327
Oh my God.

569
00:32:00,473 --> 00:32:01,403
I don't want to talk about it.

570
00:32:01,423 --> 00:32:02,881
Oh Marv, why didn't you tell me?

571
00:32:02,901 --> 00:32:04,753
Oh, it's all right, it's all right.

572
00:32:04,773 --> 00:32:05,752
I can't think of it now.

573
00:32:05,772 --> 00:32:07,513
I gotta get to the party.

574
00:32:07,533 --> 00:32:08,347
I'll wait for you.

575
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:09,394
No, no, no, no, no, you need to go home.

576
00:32:09,414 --> 00:32:10,663
You work hard too.

577
00:32:10,683 --> 00:32:13,093
No, Marv, I wanna wait for you.

578
00:32:13,113 --> 00:32:14,486
Okay.

579
00:32:17,432 --> 00:32:19,181
I'll be back just as soon as I can.

580
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,290
Alright!

581
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:48,340
Thanks, Marv.

582
00:33:02,589 --> 00:33:04,701
So, where's Susan?

583
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,808
Hold your horses, man.

584
00:33:19,506 --> 00:33:22,096
I thought you said Tommy would be here.

585
00:33:22,116 --> 00:33:24,410
I didn't say he would for sure.

586
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,856
Well I better get going.

587
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:33,026
Why don't you loosen up for once?

588
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:30,768
Susan?

589
00:35:50,244 --> 00:35:51,416
Man, I am beat.

590
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:31,293
I waited for you.

591
00:36:33,931 --> 00:36:36,933
We ran out of corned beef and chicken.

592
00:36:38,221 --> 00:36:41,903
Probably you took it with
you for the catering.

593
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,542
I called Grunfield at home.

594
00:36:45,562 --> 00:36:48,153
He said he wouldn't sell
us any more chicken.

595
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,113
Said he'd see you in court.

596
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:54,780
Gracie... You weren't here

597
00:36:55,759 --> 00:36:59,891
and the customers were
complaining so I thought maybe-

598
00:36:59,911 --> 00:37:03,991
- Gracie, don't be mad at me, Gracie.

599
00:37:05,328 --> 00:37:10,198
I am so, God, what am I doing?

600
00:37:13,112 --> 00:37:16,439
What am I doing in this place?

601
00:37:21,487 --> 00:37:26,486
Sometimes I think I'd
just like to forget this.

602
00:37:31,448 --> 00:37:32,948
Forget everything.

603
00:37:34,736 --> 00:37:38,558
You have me, don't forget that.

604
00:38:56,797 --> 00:38:58,798
Dirty God damn queers.

605
00:39:04,932 --> 00:39:06,288
Stop!

606
00:39:06,308 --> 00:39:07,309
Oh shit!

607
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:10,849
Come on!

608
00:39:19,937 --> 00:39:20,937
Want some?

609
00:39:22,397 --> 00:39:24,260
- Morty.
- Hey.

610
00:39:34,715 --> 00:39:35,716
Got a headache?

611
00:39:36,926 --> 00:39:38,225
No, it's okay, I'm fine.

612
00:39:39,534 --> 00:39:41,518
Ever tried heat therapy?

613
00:39:42,805 --> 00:39:43,805
What is that?

614
00:39:44,494 --> 00:39:46,916
Here, take my hand and point it

615
00:39:46,936 --> 00:39:49,318
wherever the pain is the strongest.

616
00:39:50,165 --> 00:39:51,165
Go ahead.

617
00:39:57,093 --> 00:39:58,093
Pain still there?

618
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:04,514
Did it move? - A little.

619
00:40:04,534 --> 00:40:05,534
Well move my hand.

620
00:40:07,913 --> 00:40:10,107
How do you know this stuff?

621
00:40:10,127 --> 00:40:13,536
Well, I've had some training.

622
00:40:18,012 --> 00:40:19,254
Healers and Sherpas.

623
00:40:20,411 --> 00:40:22,562
They keep inviting me to dinner.

624
00:40:22,582 --> 00:40:24,921
I'm hungry, so I go.

625
00:40:24,941 --> 00:40:27,482
Then one day Helen's brother says to me

626
00:40:27,502 --> 00:40:30,418
he wants to have a man to man talk.

627
00:40:30,438 --> 00:40:33,272
Uh-oh, I know this spells trouble.

628
00:40:33,292 --> 00:40:37,041
'Cause it has been my experience
in this kind of matter.

629
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:38,472
Nice gal, isn't she?

630
00:40:38,492 --> 00:40:41,403
Yeah, sure.

631
00:40:43,568 --> 00:40:44,952
So what do you do?

632
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,469
I'm a healer.

633
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:49,302
Oh, you're a doctor.

634
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:52,540
No, I don't believe in the practices

635
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,009
of the medical profession.

636
00:40:54,029 --> 00:40:55,179
I'm a natural-path.

637
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:56,740
Sounds like fancy business.

638
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,554
You make good money? - Benny!

639
00:40:58,574 --> 00:41:01,899
Getting more and more clients every day.

640
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:04,327
- What's your last name?
- Blankenhorner.

641
00:41:04,347 --> 00:41:06,807
Hmm, never heard of it.

642
00:41:06,827 --> 00:41:08,137
Is that Slavic?

643
00:41:08,157 --> 00:41:09,351
No, actually.

644
00:41:12,017 --> 00:41:14,257
You're not her grandfather
by any chance, are you?

645
00:41:14,277 --> 00:41:16,394
No, no, of course not.

646
00:41:20,407 --> 00:41:22,376
Sorry, I gotta get back to work.

647
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,411
So you want to give me your phone number?

648
00:41:27,566 --> 00:41:28,566
Yeah, sure.

649
00:41:54,414 --> 00:41:57,363
So then he says, well,
don't you like Helen?

650
00:41:57,383 --> 00:41:59,664
I say sure I like Helen.

651
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:02,864
And then he says, well,
don't you want to marry her?

652
00:42:02,884 --> 00:42:05,113
Then before I have a chance to answer,

653
00:42:05,133 --> 00:42:07,903
he says, you know being
a kike won't bother her.

654
00:42:07,923 --> 00:42:12,497
I didn't know what I just said, I was speechless.

655
00:42:12,517 --> 00:42:14,325
You listening to me?

656
00:42:16,183 --> 00:42:17,785
Where you going, hey?

657
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:23,132
Susan, I'm worried about you.

658
00:42:23,152 --> 00:42:23,964
What do you mean?

659
00:42:23,984 --> 00:42:25,611
Well, you're a very sweet girl.

660
00:42:25,631 --> 00:42:27,138
I don't want to see you get hurt.

661
00:42:27,158 --> 00:42:29,720
Benny, what are you talking about?

662
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,485
That fella you were talking to.

663
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,286
I really can't talk about this right now.

664
00:42:35,306 --> 00:42:37,103
But Susan.

665
00:42:38,863 --> 00:42:42,259
The Slavic fella, what was his name?

666
00:42:42,279 --> 00:42:44,099
- Tommy.
- Waitress.

667
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:45,690
Tommy, that's right.

668
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:46,865
You should stay away from him.

669
00:42:46,885 --> 00:42:48,377
I can't talk about this right now.

670
00:42:48,397 --> 00:42:49,211
I wouldn't trust him.

671
00:42:49,231 --> 00:42:51,750
What do you know about him anyway?

672
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:52,889
What's to know?

673
00:42:52,909 --> 00:42:53,817
Anybody can see.

674
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:56,010
How about some fucking service?

675
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,758
Look, would you just
stop following me around?

676
00:42:57,778 --> 00:42:59,578
This is really none of
your business anyway.

677
00:42:59,598 --> 00:43:02,165
Calm down, I don't wanna upset you.

678
00:43:02,185 --> 00:43:04,389
It's just that you've been here a while

679
00:43:04,409 --> 00:43:07,290
and you're a sweet girl
and we worry about you,

680
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:09,428
kind of like your family.

681
00:43:09,448 --> 00:43:11,537
Look, I came here to
get away from my family.

682
00:43:11,557 --> 00:43:12,907
I don't need a whole new set of parents

683
00:43:12,927 --> 00:43:13,998
butting into my business.

684
00:43:14,018 --> 00:43:15,837
But we weren't butting into your business.

685
00:43:15,857 --> 00:43:16,911
We, we just-

686
00:43:16,931 --> 00:43:18,482
- Will you just leave me alone?

687
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:36,744
Marv!

688
00:43:41,351 --> 00:43:42,351
Out.

689
00:43:43,472 --> 00:43:44,597
Get out of here.

690
00:43:46,084 --> 00:43:48,784
- What?
- And don't come back.

691
00:43:48,804 --> 00:43:50,734
What, man, what?

692
00:43:50,754 --> 00:43:52,636
You think I'm stupid?

693
00:43:52,656 --> 00:43:54,394
Get out of here.

694
00:43:54,414 --> 00:43:55,568
- What?
- Out!

695
00:43:57,144 --> 00:43:58,144
Out!

696
00:43:59,545 --> 00:44:02,297
Hey, you fucking pigs, what are you doing?

697
00:44:02,317 --> 00:44:05,485
Leave him alone, he didn't do nothing.

698
00:44:06,432 --> 00:44:08,062
Thank you, officers.

699
00:44:08,082 --> 00:44:09,013
Come back when you're through

700
00:44:09,033 --> 00:44:11,573
and I'll get you some sandwiches.

701
00:44:11,593 --> 00:44:15,736
Man, Marv's really in with the pigs.

702
00:44:15,756 --> 00:44:18,393
Well, maybe those dudes
will finally wake up.

703
00:44:18,413 --> 00:44:19,442
Wake up is right,

704
00:44:19,462 --> 00:44:21,661
Marv's finally learning some common sense.

705
00:44:21,681 --> 00:44:23,082
I don't understand it.

706
00:44:23,102 --> 00:44:25,562
I've never seen him so angry before.

707
00:44:25,582 --> 00:44:27,368
- Well finally.
- Bunch of fascists

708
00:44:27,388 --> 00:44:28,889
Oh yeah.

709
00:45:21,747 --> 00:45:24,601
Hey man, think I can crash here tonight?

710
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:27,986
Dee got thrown in jail and-Fuck that, man.

711
00:45:28,006 --> 00:45:30,305
Last time you were here,
you stole my stash.

712
00:45:30,325 --> 00:45:31,367
You ought to be locked up with him.

713
00:45:31,387 --> 00:45:33,166
I was just borrowing it, man.

714
00:45:33,186 --> 00:45:34,956
Look, I'll bring you more plus double.

715
00:45:34,976 --> 00:45:36,179
Now way.

716
00:45:37,066 --> 00:45:38,587
Alison, you tell him.

717
00:45:52,785 --> 00:45:53,785
Hi.

718
00:45:54,819 --> 00:45:55,901
Come on in.

719
00:46:08,328 --> 00:46:10,362
You have a really nice place.

720
00:46:10,382 --> 00:46:12,323
This is where I treat my clients.

721
00:46:12,343 --> 00:46:14,162
But it doubles as a living room.

722
00:46:14,182 --> 00:46:15,182
Have a seat.

723
00:46:17,346 --> 00:46:18,535
Care for something?

724
00:46:20,632 --> 00:46:21,632
Sure.

725
00:46:48,638 --> 00:46:50,838
I've never actually tried that before.

726
00:46:50,858 --> 00:46:51,859
Never?

727
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,109
Well isn't it supposed
to be, you know, dangerous?

728
00:46:57,381 --> 00:46:59,126
Hey, it's good for you.

729
00:46:59,989 --> 00:47:01,161
It's therapeutic.

730
00:47:03,308 --> 00:47:06,058
It's just that I smoked
something last night.

731
00:47:06,078 --> 00:47:08,572
This is the best stuff on the market.

732
00:47:09,458 --> 00:47:12,487
I would never give you anything funky.

733
00:47:12,507 --> 00:47:13,510
You can trust me.

734
00:47:15,147 --> 00:47:18,450
Just inhale real deep and
hold it in your lungs.

735
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:50,046
You okay? - I'm fine.

736
00:48:02,893 --> 00:48:04,046
There you go.

737
00:48:12,253 --> 00:48:13,452
I don't feel anything.

738
00:48:14,322 --> 00:48:16,742
Patience, you will.

739
00:48:21,191 --> 00:48:22,191
Excuse me.

740
00:48:32,191 --> 00:48:33,914
Hey man.

741
00:48:33,934 --> 00:48:35,431
You think I could crash here tonight?

742
00:48:35,451 --> 00:48:37,131
I've been through some rough shit.

743
00:48:37,151 --> 00:48:38,614
Well.

744
00:48:59,289 --> 00:49:00,289
Sorry about that.

745
00:49:08,609 --> 00:49:10,276
What's on your mind?

746
00:49:11,672 --> 00:49:13,192
Nothing.

747
00:49:13,212 --> 00:49:15,237
Come on, sure there is.

748
00:49:15,257 --> 00:49:17,457
Well, it's just that I always see you

749
00:49:17,477 --> 00:49:18,909
with all these girls.

750
00:49:19,906 --> 00:49:21,961
They all seem to be crazy about you.

751
00:49:23,124 --> 00:49:27,293
I mean, I know I like you
but why did you choose me?

752
00:49:29,648 --> 00:49:34,468
Because, you're special, that's why.

753
00:49:58,427 --> 00:49:59,759
I'm so hungry.

754
00:50:03,809 --> 00:50:04,809
You are?

755
00:50:06,458 --> 00:50:07,886
Well, better take care of that.

756
00:50:11,672 --> 00:50:13,985
Sweet or salty?

757
00:50:14,922 --> 00:50:17,213
- Definitely sweet.
- Sweet, huh?

758
00:50:17,233 --> 00:50:18,233
Mm, yes.

759
00:50:53,913 --> 00:50:54,913
Oh no.

760
00:50:58,546 --> 00:51:00,046
Better go find it.

761
00:51:06,617 --> 00:51:07,667
What are you doing?

762
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,023
I've got to find my grape.

763
00:51:27,892 --> 00:51:30,059
What are you staring at?

764
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:33,909
Stop, just ignore him.

765
00:51:33,929 --> 00:51:37,267
Hey man, I asked you a
question, you got a problem?

766
00:51:37,287 --> 00:51:39,705
No, I don't have a problem.

767
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,042
Then what are you staring at?

768
00:51:42,062 --> 00:51:43,612
I wasn't staring at anything.

769
00:51:45,827 --> 00:51:48,048
Look, we don't want any trouble.

770
00:51:48,068 --> 00:51:49,710
We just wanna get something to eat, okay?

771
00:51:51,949 --> 00:51:52,763
Damn it!

772
00:51:52,783 --> 00:51:54,430
You know, it used to be my wife and I

773
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:55,910
would fight like cats and dogs.

774
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:57,221
I'd come here to get away.

775
00:51:57,241 --> 00:52:00,020
Now I come here and everyone's
fighting like cats and dogs.

776
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,701
This fucker doesn't like your beer.

777
00:52:01,721 --> 00:52:03,131
Marty, you gotta get rid of these scumbags.

778
00:52:03,151 --> 00:52:05,711
Who you calling a scumbag, fuckhole?

779
00:52:05,731 --> 00:52:06,544
He really didn't mean it.

780
00:52:06,564 --> 00:52:07,571
What do you mean I didn't mean it?

781
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:08,404
Of course I meant it.

782
00:52:08,424 --> 00:52:10,241
- Calm down, calm down.
- Look at me.

783
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:12,996
I want an apology. - Get him out of here.

784
00:52:13,016 --> 00:52:14,142
You'll take care of it,

785
00:52:14,162 --> 00:52:15,511
just like you take care of
all the cockroaches, huh?

786
00:52:15,531 --> 00:52:18,444
How about a ride on my hog, baby?

787
00:52:18,464 --> 00:52:20,231
Look, I'll give you 10% off

788
00:52:20,251 --> 00:52:21,713
of all the things that you eat, okay?

789
00:52:21,733 --> 00:52:22,569
You and your girl.

790
00:52:22,589 --> 00:52:24,156
Look, you're not the only one with friends

791
00:52:24,176 --> 00:52:25,466
down at city hall, Marv.

792
00:52:26,335 --> 00:52:27,918
What are you doing?

793
00:52:44,014 --> 00:52:45,714
I wish I could lie here forever.

794
00:52:47,065 --> 00:52:50,087
Yeah, me too.

795
00:52:59,975 --> 00:53:02,738
Whoa, what time is it?

796
00:53:07,716 --> 00:53:12,718
Shit, I got a client coming soon.

797
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:14,777
You gotta go.

798
00:53:36,908 --> 00:53:38,008
Oh, you know the landlord

799
00:53:38,028 --> 00:53:39,988
is supposed to be doing
something about that.

800
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:42,696
He keeps putting me off
if you know what I mean.

801
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:48,612
How about a piece of fresh
German chocolate cake?

802
00:53:51,799 --> 00:53:54,319
You have a serious roach
problem here, Mr. Bel-key.

803
00:53:54,339 --> 00:53:56,340
You know Alma, I've
been in the deli business

804
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:59,593
since I've been 12 and
I've never seen a kitchen

805
00:53:59,613 --> 00:54:01,402
that didn't have a few problems.

806
00:54:02,564 --> 00:54:04,820
If you don't take care of
these things in two weeks,

807
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,632
I'll have to close you down.

808
00:54:11,699 --> 00:54:15,624
Gracie, dial up city
hall and get me Mr. Kilmsy.

809
00:54:17,202 --> 00:54:18,652
Tell him Christmas is coming.

810
00:54:22,107 --> 00:54:25,431
What?

811
00:54:25,451 --> 00:54:27,015
Kilmsy's been retired.

812
00:54:28,656 --> 00:54:29,656
Huh?

813
00:54:30,617 --> 00:54:35,617
♪ Coventry, Coventry, make
it like it used to be ♪

814
00:54:37,697 --> 00:54:42,698
♪ Coventry, Coventry, keep
it safe for you and me ♪

815
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,085
Get out of here!

816
00:54:46,105 --> 00:54:46,918
Marv, this is public property.

817
00:54:46,938 --> 00:54:48,005
We have a right to peacefully demonstrate.

818
00:54:48,025 --> 00:54:48,838
Out!

819
00:54:48,858 --> 00:54:50,327
Come on guys, keep singing.

820
00:54:50,347 --> 00:54:53,019
♪ Coventry, Coventry ♪

821
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,374
I can't believe it.

822
00:54:54,394 --> 00:54:56,209
He used to come here every night

823
00:54:56,229 --> 00:54:58,044
and I'd have Timbers make him

824
00:54:58,064 --> 00:54:59,654
an extra thick pastrami sandwich,

825
00:54:59,674 --> 00:55:02,999
and I mean extra thick, like that.

826
00:55:03,019 --> 00:55:06,017
You know, I'm the one who
fed him through school.

827
00:55:06,037 --> 00:55:08,223
And then he turns around
and stabs me in the back

828
00:55:08,243 --> 00:55:10,234
just because he's a lawyer now.

829
00:55:10,254 --> 00:55:12,252
He thinks he can tell me
how to run my business.

830
00:55:12,272 --> 00:55:14,260
Who does he think he is?

831
00:55:18,013 --> 00:55:19,040
What happened?

832
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:22,167
The pastrami steamer blew up.

833
00:55:22,187 --> 00:55:23,972
For Christ sakes, I just had it serviced.

834
00:55:23,992 --> 00:55:26,059
That was three years ago.

835
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:28,327
Go to Schlo and Moe's and buy 20 pounds.

836
00:55:28,347 --> 00:55:29,461
There's no money.

837
00:55:29,481 --> 00:55:31,279
What do you mean no money?

838
00:55:31,299 --> 00:55:33,307
There's nothing left in petty cash.

839
00:55:33,327 --> 00:55:35,195
I looked at the books and
we're in debt over $3,000.

840
00:55:35,215 --> 00:55:37,086
Don't pay the payroll tax.

841
00:55:37,106 --> 00:55:38,559
We haven't paid that in five months.

842
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:40,422
Cancel the insurance.

843
00:55:40,442 --> 00:55:43,500
We canceled that last year.

844
00:55:47,548 --> 00:55:49,001
Marv, don't do it.

845
00:55:51,518 --> 00:55:55,088
Moish? Yeah, it's me.

846
00:55:55,108 --> 00:56:00,108
Give me a $200 on Fat Chance,
fourth race at Santa Anita.

847
00:56:01,088 --> 00:56:03,375
- That's everything.
- I feel lucky.

848
00:56:03,395 --> 00:56:04,975
That's what I said.

849
00:56:04,995 --> 00:56:08,463
$200, Fat Chance, fourth race, Santa Anita.

850
00:56:09,874 --> 00:56:12,792
12 to one, you've lost your mind.

851
00:56:13,798 --> 00:56:16,274
I told ya, I feel lucky.

852
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:44,005
Get me a corned beef on rye.

853
00:56:46,881 --> 00:56:47,963
I'm awfully sorry, Morty,

854
00:56:47,983 --> 00:56:50,586
but we're out of corned beef tonight.

855
00:56:51,722 --> 00:56:53,223
Well then get me a pastrami.

856
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:55,673
We're out of that too.

857
00:56:55,693 --> 00:56:56,572
What?

858
00:56:56,592 --> 00:56:58,230
You going vegetarian or something?

859
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:00,554
We have everything else.

860
00:57:00,574 --> 00:57:04,134
Isn't that nice, everything
but pastrami and corned beef.

861
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:05,994
Morty, just order.

862
00:57:06,014 --> 00:57:07,964
All right, give me a matzoh ball

863
00:57:07,984 --> 00:57:10,117
and give him a cheese blintz.

864
00:57:13,424 --> 00:57:16,946
Imagine running a deli without
pastrami and corned beef.

865
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:18,525
What'll be next, the pickles?

866
00:57:18,545 --> 00:57:21,435
It's not her fault the
pastrami steamer blew up.

867
00:57:21,455 --> 00:57:23,416
Well, last week it was the ceiling.

868
00:57:23,436 --> 00:57:25,616
Before that it was the furnace.

869
00:57:25,636 --> 00:57:27,884
Frankly, I wouldn't mind if them communists

870
00:57:27,904 --> 00:57:30,035
did close Marv down.

871
00:57:30,055 --> 00:57:31,105
Where would you go?

872
00:57:32,106 --> 00:57:33,376
Schlo and Moe's.

873
00:57:33,396 --> 00:57:35,023
They close at eight.

874
00:57:35,043 --> 00:57:39,644
Alright then, I'll go what-cha-ma-call-it.

875
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:41,877
- The saloon?
- Yeah, the saloon.

876
00:57:41,897 --> 00:57:43,787
It burned down, don't you remember?

877
00:57:43,807 --> 00:57:45,258
That's just the problem.

878
00:57:45,278 --> 00:57:47,337
He knows he's the only place.

879
00:57:47,357 --> 00:57:49,049
He can serve dirt if he wanted

880
00:57:49,069 --> 00:57:50,966
and people would still come.

881
00:57:50,986 --> 00:57:55,447
Them communists, they can march
and complain all they want,

882
00:57:55,467 --> 00:57:57,228
nothing will close down Marv's.

883
00:57:57,248 --> 00:57:58,595
He's got an empire.

884
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:13,238
- Hi Mom.
- Dougie.

885
00:58:17,883 --> 00:58:21,480
I was wondering if I could
stay here for a couple days.

886
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:24,110
- No, I don't think so.
- Frank.

887
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:26,241
Think you just ought to get out of here.

888
00:58:26,261 --> 00:58:27,311
I mean, just for a couple of days,

889
00:58:27,331 --> 00:58:28,861
I'll stay out of the way.

890
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:30,540
Yeah, just like you stay out of the way

891
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:35,184
when you're smoking marijuana,
preaching free love, huh?

892
00:58:35,204 --> 00:58:36,881
Just like you stayed out of the way

893
00:58:36,901 --> 00:58:39,128
when John got his head blown off.

894
00:58:41,591 --> 00:58:44,091
Well I think you can just
stay out of the way now.

895
00:58:45,812 --> 00:58:46,812
Frank.

896
00:58:48,704 --> 00:58:49,786
Dougie. - Mom.

897
00:59:39,356 --> 00:59:41,006
Hey, Susan.

898
00:59:41,026 --> 00:59:43,696
Hi, look, I'm sorry to come by unannounced

899
00:59:43,716 --> 00:59:45,653
but I got locked out of my apartment.

900
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:51,339
Hey, it's all right, come on in.

901
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:09,278
Deville bunched with Fat Chance

902
01:00:09,298 --> 01:00:11,221
trailing the pack.

903
01:00:11,241 --> 01:00:13,108
Come on, come on, you imbecile.

904
01:00:13,128 --> 01:00:14,258
Heading for home,

905
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:16,540
Lady Day looks to be winning.

906
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:19,499
And here comes Fat Chance making the move.

907
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:22,230
Middle of the stretch, Breeze,
Lightning and Fat Chance.

908
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:25,678
Fat Chance, Breeze, Lightning,
they're neck and neck,

909
01:00:25,698 --> 01:00:28,880
stride for stride, they're coming to the-

910
01:00:31,556 --> 01:00:32,800
- What the fuck?

911
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:35,720
Gracie!

912
01:01:35,544 --> 01:01:37,187
Of all the God damn things.

913
01:02:00,487 --> 01:02:01,487
Hi Benny.

914
01:02:02,996 --> 01:02:04,643
Nothing for me, thank you.

915
01:02:07,468 --> 01:02:09,219
Is it okay if I sit down?

916
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:13,661
Why, you're soaking wet.

917
01:02:29,098 --> 01:02:30,099
There.

918
01:02:33,722 --> 01:02:35,759
Aren't you working tonight?

919
01:02:35,779 --> 01:02:36,779
It's my day off.

920
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:41,549
What are you working on?

921
01:02:47,294 --> 01:02:49,119
It's nice.

922
01:02:49,139 --> 01:02:50,540
You think so?

923
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:53,320
I couldn't decide between red and blue

924
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:56,560
but I have some extra
red pens I got on sale

925
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:58,383
so I figured why not.

926
01:03:00,688 --> 01:03:02,981
Would you like a cup of coffee?

927
01:03:03,001 --> 01:03:04,642
Sure.

928
01:03:04,662 --> 01:03:06,274
How about a tea biscuit too?

929
01:03:08,262 --> 01:03:09,965
Okay, thanks.

930
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:24,074
One way or a two way operation.

931
01:03:30,124 --> 01:03:33,453
Grace, where are the batteries?

932
01:03:33,473 --> 01:03:35,237
I needed them for the flashlight.

933
01:03:38,155 --> 01:03:41,125
Before he was reduced
to giving Marv bargains

934
01:03:41,145 --> 01:03:42,714
he was a very famous illustrator.

935
01:03:42,734 --> 01:03:45,737
Now this here, this was his
blue period, right Benny?

936
01:03:46,767 --> 01:03:51,767
Her ruby red lips parted invitingly.

937
01:03:52,075 --> 01:03:56,345
Kyle swept her into his arms
and kissed her passionately.

938
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:58,906
Her entire body pulsated, Benny,

939
01:03:58,926 --> 01:04:00,415
I can't believe you actually subscribe

940
01:04:00,435 --> 01:04:02,021
to this decadent trash.

941
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:07,007
I didn't write it, I
just did the illustrations.

942
01:04:07,027 --> 01:04:08,997
Man, the only reason they print this trash

943
01:04:09,017 --> 01:04:11,118
is to distract the masses from their real.

944
01:04:13,138 --> 01:04:14,149
Oh wow.

945
01:04:19,816 --> 01:04:21,457
Money, money, all this corrupt society

946
01:04:21,477 --> 01:04:22,447
ever thinks about.

947
01:04:22,467 --> 01:04:24,667
Look, every war, Vietnam-

948
01:04:24,687 --> 01:04:25,711
- Come on, keep reading.

949
01:04:25,731 --> 01:04:28,298
Hey guys, what's going on?

950
01:04:28,318 --> 01:04:29,588
Doug, hey man, where you been?

951
01:04:29,608 --> 01:04:30,718
How's Dee?

952
01:04:30,738 --> 01:04:32,586
- Pigs put them in jail, man.
- Good.

953
01:04:32,606 --> 01:04:34,648
But they don't have anything on him.

954
01:04:34,668 --> 01:04:37,428
It turns out the pervert
janitor just had a concussion.

955
01:04:37,448 --> 01:04:39,589
I keep telling you,
man, pigs up their orders,

956
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:40,970
keep the people down.

957
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:42,480
You gonna eat that?

958
01:04:47,448 --> 01:04:48,448
Hey Timbers.

959
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:01,554
Hey Timbers.

960
01:05:02,404 --> 01:05:04,230
I'm not supposed to serve you.

961
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:05,250
Come on, man.

962
01:05:18,483 --> 01:05:19,483
Thanks.

963
01:05:31,904 --> 01:05:33,086
Where did you get these, huh?

964
01:05:33,106 --> 01:05:34,211
I had 'em with me.

965
01:05:34,231 --> 01:05:35,455
I'm tired of your games.

966
01:05:35,475 --> 01:05:37,523
Come on, come on, that was a long time ago.

967
01:05:37,543 --> 01:05:38,693
Just let me stay.

968
01:05:38,713 --> 01:05:40,510
Would you steal from your own home?

969
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:42,454
I don't have a home, this is my home.

970
01:05:42,474 --> 01:05:43,885
Are you gonna do this again?

971
01:05:43,905 --> 01:05:46,574
- You won!
- I won?

972
01:05:46,594 --> 01:05:50,315
- We won the race!
- I won the race!

973
01:05:55,709 --> 01:05:57,898
- Does that mean I can stay?
- I guess so, man.

974
01:05:57,918 --> 01:05:58,954
Alright!

975
01:05:58,974 --> 01:06:01,395
So Marv's luck was good for once

976
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:04,357

993
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:08,724
It started when the protestors marched in.

994
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,613
The roughnecks couldn't resist a fight.

995
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:20,755
People began taking
advantage of the situation.

996
01:07:20,775 --> 01:07:23,366
Brothers and sisters, the
time has come, the time is ours!

997
01:07:23,386 --> 01:07:25,999
We will smash the capitalist god above!

998
01:07:26,019 --> 01:07:27,806
We will never be brought down!

01:07:27,826 --> 01:07:29,075
We will not be-

1000
01:07:39,163 --> 01:07:43,015
I think the whole
thing drove Marv over the edge.

1001
01:08:18,369 --> 01:08:21,185
Within a week, Marv's was gone.

1002
01:08:21,205 --> 01:08:23,741
It was the last straw for the landlord.

1003
01:08:23,761 --> 01:08:27,235
He evicted Marvin.

1004
01:08:27,255 --> 01:08:29,910
Pretty soon the entire
block was up for sale.

1005
01:08:40,266 --> 01:08:42,557
Marv and Grace wound up in Florida,

1006
01:08:42,577 --> 01:08:45,677
walking distance from the racetrack.

1007
01:08:45,697 --> 01:08:48,308
And Susan found a library job

1008
01:08:48,328 --> 01:08:50,351
and a room a lot closer to campus.

1009
01:08:51,469 --> 01:08:56,044
As for Coventry, well, it was different.

1010
01:08:56,064 --> 01:09:00,226
Marv's wasn't perfect and never easy.

1011
01:09:00,246 --> 01:09:03,289
It was noisy, people fought there,

1012
01:09:03,309 --> 01:09:04,989
people got in each other's business,

1013
01:09:05,009 --> 01:09:08,442
but it had its good points.

1014
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:10,612
That's for sure.

1015
01:09:13,579 --> 01:09:16,898
So we were married one
week when Helen says to me

1016
01:09:16,918 --> 01:09:19,210
there's something I need to tell you.

1017
01:09:19,230 --> 01:09:22,320
I say what, tell me.

1018
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:25,960
She says, will you still love me?

1019
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:29,151
I say, yeah, yeah, go ahead.

1020
01:09:29,171 --> 01:09:30,758
You know what she says?

1021
01:09:30,778 --> 01:09:31,784
Look what I got.

1022
01:09:31,804 --> 01:09:33,492
What's that?

1023
01:09:33,512 --> 01:09:38,142
Four bags at the Daffy
Dollar store for 98 cents.

1024
01:09:38,162 --> 01:09:39,706
11 ribbons each bag.

1025
01:09:39,726 --> 01:09:41,941
What do you use those for?

1026
01:09:41,961 --> 01:09:45,043
Oh, lots of things.

1027
01:09:45,063 --> 01:09:47,072
You got the adhesive on the back.

1028
01:09:47,092 --> 01:09:48,671
You can stick it to anything.

1029
01:09:48,691 --> 01:09:52,192
- Like what?
- Oh, this and that.

1030
01:09:52,212 --> 01:09:53,834
Presents maybe.

1031
01:09:53,854 --> 01:09:56,060
When was the last time
you gave me a present?

1032
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,803
I didn't say for you.

1033
01:09:57,823 --> 01:09:59,672
Hey guys, I'd like to go home too.

1034
01:09:59,692 --> 01:10:00,692
Go home.

1035
01:10:04,262 --> 01:10:05,694
Half-hour till the bus come.

1036
01:10:11,549 --> 01:10:14,293
7A, take the 7A.

1037
01:10:14,313 --> 01:10:19,317
In about 30 minutes Marshall
Dillon's kicking us out, Jesus.
