1
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:11,539
Feelings...

2
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,208
I don't know.

3
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:18,379
Everything's...
Everything's normal.

4
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:25,153
Then, out of nowhere,
suddenly they're tearing at me.

5
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:33,761
I don't know if it's
the past or the future,

6
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:36,697
heaven or hell.

7
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,267
Scared?

8
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,734
Yeah...

9
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,703
I'm scared.

10
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:45,739
Something's happening,
again,

11
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,842
and I want to know
what it is

12
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:51,679
or who's responsible.

13
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:59,153
What do you know
about the truth?

14
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:02,690
The truth's all twisted.

15
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,928
Go back to what?

16
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,663
Think about it.

17
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:13,301
What would it
really be like to go back

18
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:14,835
and to know the future?

19
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:18,439
Everyone I grew up with,
everyone I knew,

20
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:19,807
they're dead,

21
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,942
or in some retirement home.

22
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:22,976
I go visit them.

23
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:28,549
The kids I grew up with
don't even know who I am.

24
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:29,717
Why should they?

25
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,821
I don't even know
who I am.

26
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:54,575
These feelings...
how long have they
been going on?

27
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,977
I don't know.

28
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,612
Three months.

29
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:03,351
That was when
you lost your business.

30
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:05,986
What's that got to do
with anything?

31
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,423
Now the bank
wants to foreclose
on your house.

32
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:16,330
I told those guys
I just need a little time,
that's all.

33
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:22,436
How's Benjamin?

34
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:27,475
How is he, David?

35
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:31,379
He misses his mother.

36
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:34,315
School?

37
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,687
He's doing fine.

38
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,955
Missed five days
last month.

39
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,293
You seem to know
all the answers, doctor!

40
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:48,028
Why bother
asking the questions?

41
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:52,566
All I want to know
is what's going on.

42
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,734
You owe me that!

43
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:57,538
Nothing.
Nothing's going on.

44
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,740
These hallucinations
coincide

45
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:02,676
with high-stress
incidents...

46
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,678
The death
of your wife,

47
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:05,746
collapse of
your business.

48
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,449
A period of remorse,
of introspection,

49
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:11,819
even resentment
is inevitable.

50
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:15,389
You have to
come to terms,

51
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:17,825
to accept
what's happened.

52
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:21,729
You have to
move on.

53
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,999
Are you finished?

54
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,877
David.

55
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,479
David!

56
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,314
The Navy wants to know

57
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:42,450
if you'll consider
coming back.

58
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:45,553
They'll clear the slate,

59
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,688
take care
of the mortgage,

60
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,957
settle the bills.

61
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,960
I have to ask.

62
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,695
They have my blood.

63
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:58,799
Tell them I'll
hang on to my soul.

64
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:12,913
This is 1-1-7 Alpha.

65
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:19,387
Bearing 2-9-0.

66
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,722
Descending.

67
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:27,327
0-0-0. Over.

68
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:31,732
The stealth fighter,
gentlemen...

69
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:35,536
100 million tax dollars
a pop.

70
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:39,973
The American people ponied up
for one reason.

71
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,710
It was the future.

72
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:46,580
It was invincible
and invisible.

73
00:05:46,614 --> 00:05:50,350
Enable systems.

74
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:55,155
Alpha Romeo,
this is test control.

75
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,791
Series 4...

76
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:04,432
Nest to rogue bird.
You are clear to cloak.

77
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:07,735
Decode.

78
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,970
Charlie, Romeo. Commence.

79
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,506
3... 2...

80
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,575
1...

81
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:21,582
Peaceful, isn't it?

82
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:25,853
She's up there somewhere
between earth and heaven,

83
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,589
and we can't see her, right?

84
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:31,659
When you approved phase one
of this project,

85
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:34,462
I told you that
scientific innovation

86
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,863
was constant competition.

87
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,131
If we build a better mouse,

88
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,968
somebody will build
a better trap.

89
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,504
Show them, Hank.

90
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:48,709
Transponders are on.

91
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,778
Commencing ultrasound
emissions...

92
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:53,146
Now.

93
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:04,024
Overlay... On.

94
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,628
What the hell is that?

95
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:10,898
It's exactly what
you think it is, sir...

96
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,132
Our invisible aircraft.

97
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,468
It's an acoustical
tracking system.

98
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:18,739
We picked it up from
a disemployed Soviet physicist.

99
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,674
Sold it to us cheap.

100
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,776
We're failing, gentlemen.

101
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,645
Radar stealth is dead.

102
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,580
The truth is

103
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:29,750
that if you want to make
something invisible,

104
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,920
you have to make it
disappear.

105
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,188
Yeah! Way to connect,
Benny!

106
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:36,857
That's a double!

107
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,058
Let's go!

108
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,993
Come on!

109
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,229
Throw it!

110
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,265
Safe!

111
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:45,933
What?

112
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,535
All right.
Nice hustle, Ben.

113
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:50,871
Save some for
the opening game.

114
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:51,505
Dad!

115
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:54,608
Sorry, coach.
I got to go.

116
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,209
Be on time Saturday,
Benny.

117
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:59,747
Remember, this
is opening game
this weekend.

118
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,148
Let's go.
Next batter.

119
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,250
Come on, Joey!
You're up!

120
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,752
Heads up, guys.

121
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:07,287
Come on.
Look alive.

122
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,157
All right.
All right.

123
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:14,995
So mark says Terminator
kills predator,

124
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,897
but I say no way.

125
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,231
Predator's cool, right?

126
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:21,869
Then Paul goes, "no.
Robocop kills them both."

127
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:23,303
What do you say?

128
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,172
About what?

129
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,174
Dad!

130
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:30,711
Terminator and predator
against robocop.

131
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,012
Who wins?

132
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,982
I don't know...
Superman.

133
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:38,952
Superman? Come on, dad.
He's a wimp.

134
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,921
Superman's not a wimp.

135
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:43,691
That's the man of steel.

136
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:46,293
Yeah, well, adamantium's
harder than steel.

137
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:49,697
That's why superman retired.

138
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,699
Ada what?

139
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:55,603
Adamantium...
Hardest metal on earth.

140
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:56,904
Look, I got some.

141
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,906
Traded my lunch for it.

142
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,041
See? You can't break it.

143
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,610
Don't do that.

144
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:03,510
Let me see that.

145
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,747
This is what
put superman
out of business?

146
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,218
Yep. Think it'll go good
on old blue?

147
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,021
Well, we'll give it
a shot.

148
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,155
Really? Cool!

149
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,157
It's still another sunny day

150
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,761
in sunny Southern California
on 102.2 fm

151
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,295
here in Santa Paula.

152
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:23,263
It's may 3, 1993,

153
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:26,734
and the second hand
is ticking on

154
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,135
towards 5:03 in the afternoon.

155
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:32,773
Coming up, we have
another uninterrupted hour...

156
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:56,163
I'm already
fast as Tommy.

157
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,731
Maybe faster.

158
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,299
But he's got
better stuff.

159
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:03,937
I get my curve ball going,
I know I'll start.

160
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:05,038
Coach said so.

161
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:07,775
Don't throw the ball
in the house.

162
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:11,779
Wouldn't that be cool...
Me winning the opening game?

163
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:14,247
I'll help you,
later!

164
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,383
When? The game's
on Saturday,

165
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,151
and I really want to...

166
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:21,421
I told you
not to do that!

167
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,856
I'm working!

168
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,025
Nothing's broken.

169
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:28,295
Good. Now, take it
outside, all right?

170
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,397
Will you come with me?

171
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,999
Not right now.

172
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:35,168
But the curve.
You always say...

173
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:36,704
Damn it!

174
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:38,806
Sorry, dad.

175
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,213
The curve.

176
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,282
The curve.

177
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,152
You want to see
the curve?

178
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:52,920
Yeah.

179
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:55,188
All right.
I'll show you the curve.

180
00:10:55,222 --> 00:11:00,894
Remember, it's just
a swing of the arm
does it, all right?

181
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:03,731
Elbow high,
wrist relaxed,

182
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,165
just like that.

183
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:06,834
You see it?

184
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:08,769
Kind of.

185
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:09,703
Get your bat.

186
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:13,774
Some guys try
and force it
with the wrist,

187
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,142
but you can't.

188
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,844
Watch the ball.

189
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,378
See the action?

190
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,246
Yeah!

191
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,814
Give me another.

192
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,916
Here we go.
Last strike.

193
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,085
Bottom of the ninth.

194
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,319
Bases loaded.

195
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:30,157
Checks his man
on first.

196
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,226
The pitch.

197
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:37,998
Oh, and he's
out of there!

198
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,132
Lucky catch.

199
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:43,170
There's nothing wrong
with a little luck.

200
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,773
Come on, dad.
Throw me another.

201
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:49,076
You go on outside
and practice.

202
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:52,512
I need someone
to catch the ball.

203
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:57,818
Go on. I'll play catch
with you after dinner.

204
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,486
O.K.

205
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,022
After dinner.

206
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:05,058
1943,
the Philadelphia experiment.

207
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:08,328
Professor James longstreet's
baby-step attempts

208
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:13,266
to cloak a U.S. Navy destroyer
from enemy radar.

209
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,035
Instead,
the entire ship vanishes

210
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:20,273
from the face of the earth
for almost one hour...

211
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:23,243
Disappears, gentlemen.

212
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:29,149
The same year Berlin scientist
friedreich mailer,

213
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,250
my father,

214
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,551
initiates radar-jamming research

215
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,455
to assist in
daylight bombing raids.

216
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,457
Marginal success,

217
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,892
although one prototype aircraft

218
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:43,030
is rumored to have achieved
invisibility.

219
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:47,067
1984, Nevada,
shortly after my father's death,

220
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,438
longstreet incorporates
mailer's research

221
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,974
in his own endeavors to generate

222
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,242
an electromagnetic
missile shield

223
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,345
over a small town
near a military base.

224
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:02,582
This time,
an entire town is gone

225
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,517
for nearly one day.

226
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:08,922
Analyses were debated,

227
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:12,159
reports written, filed...

228
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:13,994
Forgotten.

229
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:17,564
Mailer and longstreet's research
was written off

230
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:21,068
as freakish acts of nature
until now.

231
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:26,339
Gentlemen, from the ashes
of these misfires,

232
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:32,545
I am here to tell you
will rise a technology, a tool,

233
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,949
a weapon that will burn
most brightly

234
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:39,519
in this country's arsenal.

235
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,224
Follow me...

236
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:52,832
And I will show you the future.

237
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,938
Imagine being able
to move an object

238
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:02,943
from point a to point b
quickly, silently, invisibly.

239
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:08,481
Imagine instantaneous deployment
with unlimited range.

240
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,919
Imagine omnipresence.

241
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:16,289
Imagine no more,
gentlemen,

242
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:20,860
for I give you
super stealth.

243
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,097
The Philadelphia experiment...

244
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:27,567
Perfected at last.

245
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,993
[Sizzling]

246
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,994
Nearing
critical spectrum.

247
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:50,017
Dad!

248
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:52,019
Dad, what's happening?

249
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:55,222
What's going on?

250
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:59,692
Go to your room.

251
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:02,962
Please. Go!

252
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:09,736
Not bad, sir.

253
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,404
Not bad at all.

254
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:12,705
It gets
even better.

255
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:13,873
Super stealth
is the weapon

256
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:19,246
that will enable us
to seize this moment
of detente and...

257
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,648
What about human pain
and misery?

258
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,784
What about the world
as we know it,

259
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,019
changed instantaneously?

260
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:26,886
Professor longstreet.

261
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,422
This technology is
your vision realized.

262
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:31,224
We've discussed
its potential.

263
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:37,130
[Longstreet]
Yes, but things have changed.
You've gone too far.

264
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,667
The Philadelphia
experiment...

265
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,102
That ship
didn't disappear

266
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:44,771
into some
dimensional
waiting room.

267
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:48,475
We cut
a hole through
40 years of time

268
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,510
and almost shattered
the continuum.

269
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,745
But we've refined
the process

270
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,581
so time
isn't a variable.

271
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,750
Potential for errors
is virtually nil.

272
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:59,719
Tell them
about the people

273
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:02,655
who went through
the vortex.

274
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,124
The young men's
bodies

275
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:07,194
melted into the hull
of that ship.

276
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:09,362
Only one man
traveled
successfully

277
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:10,730
through the vortex.

278
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,065
His unique
metabolism

279
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,766
created
his own individual
continuum.

280
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,704
These experiments
are destabilizing
his DNA,

281
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,340
literally
tearing him apart.

282
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:24,077
It must end now.

283
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:26,113
The intricate
weave of time

284
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:29,716
is not ours
to unravel.

285
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:33,686
We'll reconvene tomorrow
at 0800 hours.

286
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,590
You'll have
our decision then.

287
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:40,560
Thank you, Professor.

288
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:49,269
You swore to me

289
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:52,372
theoretical research
strictly.

290
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,841
You opened
pandora's box, James.

291
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,876
This is what came out.

292
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:04,284
Arrogance and ambition...
It's a dangerous mix.

293
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,627
Fly in the ointment.

294
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:15,728
Yes, sir.

295
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,231
Well, whatever
happens, sir,

296
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:23,270
it's been a pleasure
working for you.

297
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:26,239
Gratitude is
the disease of dogs.

298
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,575
Nietzsche.

299
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:31,478
No. Stalin.

300
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:35,282
[Telephone ringing]

301
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,251
[Ring]

302
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:39,252
Yeah.

303
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,052
David.

304
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:42,855
You son of a bitch.
You lied to me.

305
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:45,925
I didn't know
the extent of it, honestly.

306
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,729
They're further along
than I thought.

307
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,664
Dangerously so.

308
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:52,532
No shit.

309
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:53,666
You listen to me.

310
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,769
I'm getting the hell
away from you

311
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,471
and whatever
you're doing.

312
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:00,507
I need to talk to you.

313
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,942
You've got to listen
to me.

314
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,811
Forget it.
Not this time.

315
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:07,547
You're not dragging
me in again.

316
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,450
Go find
someone else.

317
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,288
Oh, Benny.

318
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,293
Benny!

319
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:48,821
Where you driving to, kid?

320
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:49,989
Nowhere.

321
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,192
Can I get in?

322
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:05,705
Are you dying,
like mom?

323
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,374
No.

324
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:10,310
No, I'm not dying.

325
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,545
Well,
something happened, son.

326
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:16,749
It's hard to explain,
but it's hurting me.

327
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:20,820
If I can get away from here,
from this place,

328
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:24,624
maybe it will stop hurting,
that's all.

329
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:25,958
Can I come?

330
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:27,427
Of course you can.

331
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,698
Where are we going,
dad?

332
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,668
I don't know yet, son.

333
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:39,372
Look, I know
it's been tough.

334
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,941
I know you miss
your mom.

335
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:42,875
I miss her, too.

336
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:47,680
But you and me together,
we're a team, right?

337
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:49,949
Sometimes I don't get
to spend

338
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,919
as much time with you
as I'd like.

339
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:56,022
As long as you and I
stick together,

340
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:57,657
it'll get better,
I promise.

341
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,861
No matter where we go,
it'll get better.

342
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:04,497
I know what we could do.

343
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:05,632
We'll fix old blue.

344
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:08,801
This piece goes here
when we're done,

345
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:10,570
and we'll drive
someplace

346
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,440
where you won't
get sick anymore.

347
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:17,877
That's a great idea.

348
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:22,915
We better go inside and pack.
We got to get going.

349
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,083
O.K.

350
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:29,589
Could we wait here
a minute, dad?

351
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:35,728
You bet we could.

352
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:46,639
What's the flight plan?

353
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:48,841
It's a routine squadron
reassignment.

354
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,378
North Atlantic route
to Wiesbaden, Germany,

355
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:54,847
nuke payload, one pilot,
uninformed of our plans.

356
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:56,015
I'm aware of that.

357
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,417
The DNA testing's
incomplete.

358
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,820
We have yet to determine
human resistance...

359
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:02,822
I'm aware of that!

360
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,957
Look around you,
Hank.

361
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,359
Look at the scale

362
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:08,761
of what we have
put together

363
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:10,463
on a slush fund
shoestring.

364
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:13,800
Super stealth
is too important
to be hamstrung

365
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:14,967
by political
indifference.

366
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:18,571
My father never let
ideology interfere

in the grand parade
of history,

742

not an echo

743
00:46:29,054 --> 00:46:31,456
in the big orchestra
of civilization.

744
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:34,459
Do you understand me?

745
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:40,465
Do you understand me?

[Music stops]

747
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:45,837

[Click]

749
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,279
Good.

750
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:57,248
I'll want
a written report.

751
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:07,225
All right, boys.

752
00:47:08,126 --> 00:47:09,527
From the top.

Other side's
where we're headed,

757
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,228
where he is.

758
00:47:43,261 --> 00:47:45,630
Get through,
and we're safe...

759
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,597
Kind of.

760
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:49,667
[Herdeg]
And where I get
some answers, right?

761
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,469
Yeah, right.

This year by only 2%.

The checkpoint's
categorized just like
everything else.

765
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:01,579
Your tattoo's blown,

766
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:05,483
but this trick
might get us through.

767
00:48:05,516 --> 00:48:08,653
Now, just follow
my lead.

768
00:48:08,686 --> 00:48:10,455

We call it

793
00:49:40,045 --> 00:49:41,246
Fitting, huh?

794
00:49:41,279 --> 00:49:45,283
Only the dead
get a free ride out.

Pks say it takes
too long to patrol.

799
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:59,264
They leave out
the "too dangerous"
part.

800
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:05,136
Sounds like they built
their own problem.

801
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:09,207
This is where he is?

802
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,575

00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:39,830
Amazing.

827
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:44,269
50 years have been
very kind to you, David...

828
00:51:44,302 --> 00:51:47,705
Or else
incredibly cruel.

829
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:51,642
I can't believe
you're a part of this.

830
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:56,181
Body, mind, and soul,
I'm afraid.

831
00:51:56,214 --> 00:51:57,848
50 years.

832
00:51:57,882 --> 00:52:00,518
We were all so young.

833
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:03,288
There was hope...

834
00:52:03,588 --> 00:52:05,556
Such faith
in our cause,

835
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:10,428
endless strength
to fight the good fight.

836
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:12,597
I know.

837
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,898
I was there.

838
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:17,202
Until '43, may 4th.

839
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:21,839
I disappeared your ship,
and you never came back.

840
00:52:23,441 --> 00:52:25,376
There were stories

841
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:28,713
you'd gone forward
in time.

842
00:52:29,714 --> 00:52:33,251
24 hours later,
it didn't matter.

843
00:52:33,284 --> 00:52:35,553
Go on.

844
00:52:36,354 --> 00:52:37,888
5th of may,

845
00:52:37,922 --> 00:52:40,691
the Phoenix flew...

846
00:52:41,226 --> 00:52:44,829
Dropped her bombs
on Washington, D.C.

847
00:52:46,464 --> 00:52:50,468
15 million people gone.

848
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:54,805
Took me 20 years
to figure it out...

849
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:58,243
Why the Phoenix
never flew again,

850
00:52:58,276 --> 00:52:59,644
where it came from,

851
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:02,547
and what happened
to the damn thing.

852
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:06,851
Then one
of our operatives
found this.

853
00:53:09,454 --> 00:53:11,656
My God,
it's a stealth.

854
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,358
Nuclear-armed.

855
00:53:13,391 --> 00:53:16,427
Then it all
fell together.

856
00:53:16,961 --> 00:53:19,397
The doubts
I had about you

857
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:21,699
and the damn
Philadelphia experiment

858
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:22,867
became nightmares.

859
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,837
We did cut a hole
in time.

860
00:53:27,572 --> 00:53:31,276
The same way we sent you
forward from '43,

861
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:33,644
that plane
got sucked back there,

862
00:53:33,678 --> 00:53:37,882
landed in the heart
of Nazi Germany.

863
00:53:37,915 --> 00:53:40,251
It's my fault...

864
00:53:40,285 --> 00:53:42,320
All of it.

865
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:44,989
A foolish
young man's pride

866
00:53:45,022 --> 00:53:47,725
opened
pandora's box.

867
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,329
All this...

868
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,365
Everything
you see here

869
00:53:54,399 --> 00:53:56,734
came out of it.

870
00:53:57,468 --> 00:54:00,538
This man...
Who is he?

871
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:02,840
Friedreich mahler.

872
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:05,510
Took credit
for the plane.

873
00:54:05,543 --> 00:54:06,811
Claimed he built it.

874
00:54:06,844 --> 00:54:09,780
Was a hero when
the Phoenix struck.

875
00:54:09,814 --> 00:54:14,485
Turned scapegoat
when he couldn't
build a replacement.

876
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:18,989
See, he didn't know
the plane's real power.

877
00:54:19,023 --> 00:54:21,326
How could he?

878
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:25,630
It was lost in the blast
from its own bombs.

879
00:54:25,663 --> 00:54:28,566
Mahler killed
himself in '65,

880
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,468
utterly disgraced.

881
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:32,903
But like
all good aryans,

882
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:34,705
he brought forth a son

883
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:37,908
who's become obsessed
with the Phoenix,

884
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:40,878
obsessed with time.

885
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:44,014
He studied everything
we did in '43...

886
00:54:44,048 --> 00:54:47,284
The ship, you,
all of it.

887
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:51,489
He's reopened
the Philadelphia
experiment...

888
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:55,360
Convinced he can
go back 50 years,

889
00:54:55,393 --> 00:54:56,594
warn his father

890
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:59,430
and change
the Phoenix's
flight path

891
00:54:59,464 --> 00:55:02,600
so it survives
the blast.

892
00:55:04,935 --> 00:55:06,971
You mean...

893
00:55:07,004 --> 00:55:09,540
He's rebuilt it?

894
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,043
Your machine?

895
00:55:13,077 --> 00:55:15,513
He's close.

896
00:55:15,546 --> 00:55:18,649
He's developing a plasma
that simulates your DNA

897
00:55:18,683 --> 00:55:22,387
so he, too,
can survive the vortex.

898
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,922
Today my victories
are small,

899
00:55:24,955 --> 00:55:26,691
such as figuring out

900
00:55:26,724 --> 00:55:29,627
which may 4th
you would reappear

901
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:33,531
or where Santa Paula
used to be.

902
00:55:33,564 --> 00:55:35,099
But tomorrow night,

903
00:55:35,132 --> 00:55:38,903
we destroy his machine
completely.

904
00:55:39,136 --> 00:55:42,673
Then with you safe
in free Alaska,

905
00:55:42,707 --> 00:55:45,543
mailer's dreams
will finally perish.

906
00:55:45,576 --> 00:55:46,711
Free Alaska?

907
00:55:46,744 --> 00:55:47,612
You can't stay here.

908
00:55:47,645 --> 00:55:50,548
You're the last piece
to mailer's puzzle.

909
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:54,985
Wait. Listen to me.
You don't understand.

910
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:57,488
Yes... I do.

911
00:55:58,122 --> 00:56:01,592
Man was not meant
to play with time.

912
00:56:01,626 --> 00:56:04,429
No. My son...

913
00:56:04,462 --> 00:56:05,396
Son?

914
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:08,866
David, here
you have no son.

915
00:56:17,742 --> 00:56:19,777
Come sunrise,
we're putting you

916
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,812
on the underground
railroad.

917
00:56:21,846 --> 00:56:24,749
They'll take you
up north.

918
00:56:28,018 --> 00:56:33,157
At least you get to get
out of this place.

919
00:56:37,595 --> 00:56:38,696
Ain't exactly homey,

920
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:42,633
but then I wasn't
expecting company.

921
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:46,003
I hear
Alaska's beautiful.

922
00:56:46,036 --> 00:56:47,705
A little cold.

923
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,808
Takes about a year
to get there,

924
00:56:50,841 --> 00:56:53,143
but it's worth it,
I guess.

925
00:56:53,177 --> 00:56:55,946
Just thought
you'd like to know

926
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,715
where you're going.

927
00:56:57,748 --> 00:56:59,149
Yeah.

928
00:56:59,183 --> 00:57:01,118
You'll love Alaska,
herdeg.

929
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:03,888
I don't give
a damn about Alaska.

930
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:08,025
My name is David.
That's what people call me.

931
00:57:08,058 --> 00:57:09,594
All right.

932
00:57:09,627 --> 00:57:12,563
Pleased
to meet you, David.

933
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:22,473
California?

934
00:57:22,507 --> 00:57:24,008
Is this
an antique I.D.?

935
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:27,645
No. Well, it didn't
used to be, anyway.

936
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:28,879
Bad picture.

937
00:57:28,913 --> 00:57:31,916
They're supposed to be.

938
00:57:33,684 --> 00:57:35,119
What's this?

939
00:57:35,152 --> 00:57:36,754
What?

940
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:37,955
Oh.

941
00:57:37,988 --> 00:57:39,990
It's a credit card.

942
00:57:40,024 --> 00:57:41,792
It's a legal way

943
00:57:41,826 --> 00:57:44,028
to sucker
the middle class.

944
00:57:44,061 --> 00:57:46,163
Middle class?

945
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:54,138
Clinton,
bush, Reagan...

946
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:55,072
Carter.

947
00:57:55,105 --> 00:57:59,777
Do any of these names
mean anything to you?

948
00:58:00,678 --> 00:58:02,647
No.

949
00:58:04,048 --> 00:58:05,583
Joe DiMaggio...

950
00:58:05,616 --> 00:58:07,718
Ted Williams...

951
00:58:07,752 --> 00:58:09,720
Elvis.

952
00:58:09,754 --> 00:58:11,221
Sinatra?

953
00:58:11,255 --> 00:58:14,091
O.K.,
how about superman?

954
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:16,160
Superman.

955
00:58:17,862 --> 00:58:21,031
Some kind
of fairy tale...

956
00:58:21,065 --> 00:58:23,167
For children.

957
00:58:24,769 --> 00:58:26,136
Well...

958
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:28,172
Close.

959
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:32,176
But I hear superman
retired, anyway.

960
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:37,047
This your son?

961
00:58:37,081 --> 00:58:39,183
That's Benny.

962
00:58:40,651 --> 00:58:43,187
He's a great kid.

963
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:49,259
Is he with his mother?

964
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:54,164
No.

965
00:58:54,665 --> 00:58:57,167
No, he's not.

966
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:01,171
Do you have kids?

967
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:02,306
No.

968
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:06,176
Atomic contamination.

969
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:17,187
Women without children
ain't worth too much.

970
00:59:19,957 --> 00:59:22,793
[Helicopter approaches]

971
00:59:27,197 --> 00:59:29,600
Process
into the subject...

972
00:59:29,634 --> 00:59:31,802
Standard procedure.

973
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:44,615
How long?

974
00:59:44,649 --> 00:59:46,316
Six minutes

975
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:47,017
Not bad.

00:59:50,688 --> 00:59:52,657
Yes, sir.
We're getting closer.

00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:55,693
Prepare another

01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:06,170
Yes, sir.

Commence 24-hour
stand-by.

982
01:00:08,673 --> 01:00:10,708
Yes, sir.

983
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:58,255
What the hell
are you doing here?

984
01:00:58,288 --> 01:00:59,890
You've got to listen.

985
01:00:59,924 --> 01:01:01,025
You're jeopardizing
the mission.

986
01:01:01,058 --> 01:01:04,461
He's obsessed.
You said that
yourself.

987
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:08,799
He's obsessed with me.
He's obsessed with time.

988
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:11,969
Now, what if we could
turn that around,

989
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:16,106
use it against him,
tempt him?

990
01:01:17,041 --> 01:01:19,810
What are you saying?

991
01:01:26,483 --> 01:01:29,019
We could use
the machine...

Send me back to '43...

993
01:01:30,821 --> 01:01:33,791
Stop the plane
from ever taking off.

994
01:01:33,824 --> 01:01:38,829
No, no. I told you,
never again.

995
01:01:38,863 --> 01:01:42,132
What's done is done.
We can't change it.

996
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:43,868
You don't understand.

997
01:01:43,901 --> 01:01:46,871
We cannot continue
to tamper this way.

998
01:01:46,904 --> 01:01:49,073
There's a different world,
longstreet,

999
01:01:49,106 --> 01:01:50,440
with a different history.

1000
01:01:50,474 --> 01:01:52,476
I was just there
yesterday.

1001
01:01:52,509 --> 01:01:56,947
It's better than it
is here, much better.

1002
01:01:56,981 --> 01:01:57,815
It's not perfect.

1003
01:01:57,848 --> 01:02:02,019
It's got its problems,
but not like this.

1004
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:03,220
It's a nightmare here

1005
01:02:03,253 --> 01:02:06,824
because here was
not meant to be.

1006
01:02:06,857 --> 01:02:10,094
But it's been this way
for 50 years.

1007
01:02:10,127 --> 01:02:15,299
No. No, it's been
this way for one day.

1008
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:18,102
I swear.

1009
01:02:18,836 --> 01:02:20,938
It's true.
Don't you see?

1010
01:02:20,971 --> 01:02:25,109
We won the war.

1011
01:02:25,142 --> 01:02:27,111
We?

1012
01:02:29,113 --> 01:02:30,815
We won the war?

1013
01:02:30,848 --> 01:02:32,216
Yeah.

1014
01:02:33,017 --> 01:02:35,152
Yes.

1015
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:43,493
There's a cemetery
in old D.C.

1016
01:02:43,527 --> 01:02:46,496
Where they let us
put out markers

1017
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:50,200
for the victims
of the Phoenix...

was buried there...

Gathering the ripened fruit
of their labors

1022
01:03:04,348 --> 01:03:05,382
like playful children.

1023
01:03:05,415 --> 01:03:08,418
Safe under their
watchful father's eye...

1024
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:10,487
Look at me,
Jess.

1025
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:14,358
We've got to talk about
what's going to happen.

1026
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:16,560
There's
too much talk,

1027
01:03:16,593 --> 01:03:20,130
and I know what's
going to happen.

1028
01:03:20,164 --> 01:03:24,001
We'll fail,
or we'll succeed.

1029
01:03:25,102 --> 01:03:27,237
If you destroy
the Phoenix,

1030
01:03:27,271 --> 01:03:29,039
we win the war.

1031
01:03:29,073 --> 01:03:32,276
There's more to it
than that...

1032
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:36,146
A lot more, I'm afraid.

1033
01:03:37,081 --> 01:03:42,086
If we succeed...
I take that plane out,

It will be like
it never happened.

1038
01:03:58,635 --> 01:04:02,606
And no one will
remember any of it?

1039
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:04,374
No.

1040
01:04:04,408 --> 01:04:06,143
No.

1041

questioning me?

1052
01:05:06,703 --> 01:05:11,008
Wouldn't think of it...

make sense.

think you would.

What went through your mind
on your way here?

Truth twisted...
Who's responsible.

1092
01:08:35,179 --> 01:08:39,383
Well, responsibility
is generally

by the righteous,

assigned to the meek.

1097
01:08:50,594 --> 01:08:52,629
