1
00:01:42,449 --> 00:01:45,907
I start the bidding
at six hundred. Six fifty?

2
00:01:45,952 --> 00:01:48,352
I have one thousand dollars
in the back. Thank you.

3
00:02:09,943 --> 00:02:11,740
If you're here for the sports
memorabilia auction...

4
00:02:11,778 --> 00:02:13,803
it's next Wednesday.

5
00:02:15,348 --> 00:02:19,307
Oh, well, thank you,
but I'm just here...

6
00:02:19,352 --> 00:02:21,411
to look at
all the colorful pictures.

7
00:02:21,488 --> 00:02:23,080
Well, good for you.

8
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:26,922
How about this one?
lsn't it exquisite?

9
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,791
Oh, yes, very exquisite.

10
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:31,263
Yes, it is--for a fake.

11
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:33,266
A fake?

12
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,393
Yeah. See, it says here,
Lot 702...

13
00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:37,335
Young Girl by Window...

14
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,930
is seventeenth century
Phoenician school.

15
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:42,373
-But it's not.
-It's not?

16
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:46,243
See, the shading
on the burnt umber is all wrong.

17
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:47,871
I'd date this back
at the time...

18
00:02:47,914 --> 00:02:50,747
they was usin' the White House
as a get down spot.

19
00:02:50,817 --> 00:02:53,411
You know, when everybody
was up in there like that.

20
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:58,982
When certain staff members
were backin' it up.

21
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:00,924
Sir, with all due respect...

22
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:02,622
I think you'll find that
the staff here at W. Boyle--

23
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:04,630
It's a fake, OK?

24
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:06,791
-I have an eye.
-An eye?

25
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,267
Yes. Just like them glasses
you got on.

26
00:03:09,302 --> 00:03:11,361
I know when got up today,
you put 'em on.

27
00:03:11,404 --> 00:03:14,703
You got in the mirror,
you thought you were stylin'.

28
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:17,938
You came to work, you know,
get a couple of more sales.

29
00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:21,209
I know you thought they was,
what, $500 Boucherons?

30
00:03:21,248 --> 00:03:24,979
Nah, they knock-offs, darlin'.
Yeah, those are knock-offs.

31
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:29,017
They're fake, just like
this piece of shit here.

32
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:33,326
702, Young Girl by the Window.

33
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:42,599
Sold to paddle number fourteen.

34
00:03:42,636 --> 00:03:46,936
Next up, Lot 702,
Young Girl by Window...

35
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:50,101
has been pulled
from the auction.

36
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:53,840
So we'll move on to Lot 703...

37
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,474
The Hudson River Valley
lake scene.

38
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,452
A fine example of
nineteenth century American art.

39
00:04:00,487 --> 00:04:01,749
You may find it of interest...

40
00:04:01,788 --> 00:04:04,689
that the artist responsible
for this beautiful painting...

41
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:07,625
was a Boston native
who apprenticed right here...

42
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:10,221
on our very own
Commonwealth Avenue.

43
00:04:11,565 --> 00:04:12,998
My colleagues and I
here at W. Boyle...

44
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:15,797
Excuse me.

45
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:18,167
Here, let me switch with you.

46
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:20,138
Let me just try to slide by you.

47
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:21,868
Pardon me.

48
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:23,808
Please, will you watch it?

49
00:04:23,843 --> 00:04:25,743
All right, that's...

50
00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:30,377
Um, let me try this.

51
00:04:32,452 --> 00:04:35,114
-OK, OK. Slide over. Go.
-This is outrageous.

52
00:04:35,188 --> 00:04:37,088
Like that, see? Got it.

53
00:04:37,123 --> 00:04:39,921
Excuse me. All right.

54
00:04:41,661 --> 00:04:42,821
Deal a meal.

55
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:50,568
You OK?

56
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:54,196
Would you mind
just leaving me alone?

57
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:56,804
Now, if I leave you alone...

58
00:04:56,843 --> 00:04:59,744
you sitting here
on the verge of tears...

59
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:01,974
how you think
that's gonna make me feel?

60
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,678
You wouldn't understand.

61
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:09,119
That painting is yours.

62
00:05:09,155 --> 00:05:11,680
You don't want to sell it,
but you have to.

63
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:13,055
Three fifty.

64
00:05:14,394 --> 00:05:17,227
Give or take a pound.

65
00:05:17,263 --> 00:05:20,198
Five hundred. Five hundred.
Do I have five fifty?

66
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:24,431
Five fifty I have. Five fifty.
Do I have six hundred?

67
00:05:24,471 --> 00:05:27,099
My father
left me the painting...

68
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,008
and I love it, but I need
the money to pay a hotel bill.

69
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:32,409
One thousand five hundred.

70
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:34,242
One thousand five hundred.
Thank you.

71
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,840
-Two thousand.
-I have two thousand dollars.

72
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,440
Two thousand five hundred
dollars.

73
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:41,385
I have 2,500. Do I have 3,000?

74
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:43,889
Two thousand five hundred
going once...

75
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:45,447
twice--sold.

76
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:46,958
Paddle number fourteen.

77
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:49,484
Well, that's that.

78
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:51,087
What's your name?

79
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:54,396
Amber Belhaven.

80
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:56,334
Oh, very pretty name.

81
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:58,030
Kevin. Kevin Caffrey.

82
00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:00,971
Look...

83
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:03,805
I couldn't buy that painting...

84
00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:06,175
but I can buy you
a cup of coffee.

85
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:11,413
So after I graduated
university...

86
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:14,647
I moved here from London
to take this great job...

87
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:18,589
with a new natural history
website, neanderthal.com.

88
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,684
-What?
-Yeah, I know, I know.

89
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:22,922
You can figure out the rest.

90
00:06:22,962 --> 00:06:25,055
They went under, so here I am.

91
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:28,260
So what are you gonna do now?

92
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:30,235
Get a job.

93
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,760
I'm sure there are
plenty of opportunities...

94
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:34,035
for a girl with a degree
in anthropology.

95
00:06:34,074 --> 00:06:35,837
OK. Now, anthropology...

96
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,469
that's, like,
the study of man's...

97
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:40,775
See, I'm glad I read that
in the dictionary...

98
00:06:40,814 --> 00:06:43,009
or I wouldn't know.

99
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:45,040
So what do you do, Kevin?

100
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:49,149
I'm a--I'm a businessman.

101
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:52,157
Yeah. Matter of fact, I was late
for an appointment.

102
00:06:56,896 --> 00:07:01,833
I hope this is not too personal,
but in your hotel room...

103
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:04,962
do they have one of those
little refrigerators?

104
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:09,839
And in that refrigerator, do
they have those little bottles?

105
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:11,605
Yeah, I guess.

106
00:07:11,644 --> 00:07:13,202
Well,
when my appointment ends...

107
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:16,704
would you like me to come by
and check?

108
00:07:16,783 --> 00:07:18,751
See if in fact they do?

109
00:07:18,818 --> 00:07:21,286
Now, you wouldn't try
to sleep with me, would you?

110
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,361
-Why are you blinking?
-Just a little nervous tic.

111
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:32,296
I tell a lie, I blink.

112
00:07:32,332 --> 00:07:34,129
Oh, that must keep you
very honest.

113
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:35,498
I'd make a terrible lawyer.

114
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:38,299
So, can you force yourself
to blink--

115
00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:40,238
blink when
you're telling the truth?

116
00:07:41,674 --> 00:07:42,834
So when you're not blinking...

117
00:07:42,876 --> 00:07:44,537
it means you're definitely
telling the truth...

118
00:07:44,577 --> 00:07:48,013
but when you are blinking,
it means you're either lying...

119
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:49,674
or it means that you're
forcing yourself to blink...

120
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:51,341
to make it look like
you're lying.

121
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:52,543
That's right.

122
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:55,654
That sounds very complicated.

123
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:57,383
It's not, really.

124
00:07:58,424 --> 00:08:00,153
So what's up?

125
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:02,321
Can I see you later?

126
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,057
Sure.

127
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:09,830
Wait.
But you're blinking, too.

128
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:12,030
You got the same thing
that I got...

129
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:13,561
and I don't know what you...

130
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:15,437
She's got it goin' on.

131
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:17,773
I will find you.

132
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:46,333
Who is it?

133
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,389
This is for you.

134
00:09:16,703 --> 00:09:19,467
How much did he want
for that painting?

135
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:22,338
'Cause I'll pay you back
as soon as I get a job.

136
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:27,377
Well, it, uh...
it didn't cost me anything.

137
00:09:27,413 --> 00:09:28,937
What, you stole it?

138
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:30,643
That's what I do.

139
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:36,081
But I thought
you were a businessman.

140
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:39,984
I am.

141
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:42,119
I'm in the business of stealing.

142
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:44,652
Yeah,
that's why I go to auctions--

143
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:46,631
to learn what's worth stealing.

144
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:51,603
Connoisseur
of all things portable.

145
00:09:51,671 --> 00:09:54,071
Wow.

146
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:56,200
I apologize if it's a shock.

147
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:00,939
Well, I dated a lawyer
for three years...

148
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,314
so ethically speaking,
I've seen a stretch mark or two.

149
00:10:05,351 --> 00:10:10,448
Normally, I don't tell a woman
that on the first date.

150
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,152
Then again, I don't normally
have these feelings.

151
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:14,352
Me, neither.

152
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:25,493
You see this ring?

153
00:10:27,674 --> 00:10:29,005
My father gave this to me...

154
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:31,442
to remind me every day
how much he loved me.

155
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:37,915
My father believed in fate,
and so do l.

156
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:41,552
Used to be his lucky ring.

157
00:10:41,587 --> 00:10:42,884
Now it's yours.

158
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:45,957
Well, how lucky was he?

159
00:10:46,993 --> 00:10:48,756
Well, he was wearing it...

160
00:10:48,795 --> 00:10:51,229
when he won that painting
in a card game.

161
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,457
Now I want something from you.

162
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:57,503
Name it.

163
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,336
I want you to promise me
that you'll never lie to me.

164
00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:02,898
I've been
in that kind of relationship...

165
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:04,534
and I'll never do it again.

166
00:11:04,577 --> 00:11:06,875
So no lies, OK?

167
00:11:06,913 --> 00:11:08,210
No lies.

168
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:10,943
Said without a blink.

169
00:11:16,322 --> 00:11:19,416
Oh, my God,
it's like needles in my eye.

170
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:21,825
I am too rich to have
a headache like this, Walter.

171
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:24,523
-You gotta get me out of this!
-G-get you out of this?

172
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:27,760
OK. I'll just undo
every single shady deal...

173
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:29,893
you've been a part of
for the last five years.

174
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:31,061
Sounds good to me!

175
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:32,729
There are no loopholes
this time.

176
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:34,399
Bankruptcy is the only option.

177
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,431
Great! Screw it.
Screw everybody.

178
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:38,068
Just file the goddamn papers.

179
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,373
What's the worst
that could happen?

180
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:41,039
Bankruptcy, Max.

181
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,775
That's the worst
that could happen.

182
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:46,046
Poodle cakes, it's only
the real estate company.

183
00:11:46,085 --> 00:11:48,178
This is no big deal.
Tell her, Walter.

184
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:49,882
This is a...

185
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:53,085
It's a tech-technical procedure.

186
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:56,926
Yeah, that's right--a simple
little technical procedure.

187
00:11:56,963 --> 00:11:59,488
It's humiliating, and it'll be
in all of the newspapers.

188
00:11:59,565 --> 00:12:01,032
Well...

189
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,193
Maybe my father was right
about my marrying you.

190
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:05,328
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
There is no need...

191
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:07,771
to bring your daddy into this,
sugar lumps.

192
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,900
Walter and l,
we have this all worked out.

193
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:13,605
Our strategy is planned.
Right, Walter?

194
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:17,639
Fix it, Max, or else.

195
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:20,208
There is nothing to worry about,
snuggle bunny.

196
00:12:20,253 --> 00:12:21,413
These things have a tendency...

197
00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:22,716
to work themselves out
in the end.

198
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:25,986
They always do. Come on.
Come on, give me little kisses.

199
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:28,152
Come on, let me see 'em.
Let me see the lippies.

200
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:31,225
That's it. Wanna go to lunch?

201
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:32,594
Let's go. Come on.

202
00:12:32,665 --> 00:12:34,257
Let's go.
We'll eat. We'll drink.

203
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,494
We'll forget all this crap.

204
00:12:41,774 --> 00:12:43,469
Respect.

205
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:46,239
R-e-s-p--you know the rest.

206
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:49,305
That's what's missing.
Nobody respect anything now.

207
00:12:49,348 --> 00:12:52,374
Nobody respect your work,
nobody respect your elders.

208
00:12:52,418 --> 00:12:54,079
You know what I'm sayin'?

209
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,610
Nod your head, man,
if you're awake.

210
00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:57,179
Yeah, respect. I hear you.

211
00:12:57,223 --> 00:12:59,521
If I want to talk to myself,
I'll leave myself a voice mail.

212
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:04,291
I know that good-lookin'
young man right there, baby.

213
00:13:04,363 --> 00:13:05,591
I know that smile anywhere.

214
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:07,599
What you got
for good old Uncle Jack?

215
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:09,498
Uh, nothin'.
I just came by to see Amber.

216
00:13:09,535 --> 00:13:11,594
-Where is she?
-She's workin'.

217
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:12,968
She loves to work.

218
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:15,269
She the best damn waitress
I ever hired.

219
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:16,605
All perky and shit.

220
00:13:16,642 --> 00:13:18,701
You'd like her,
you get to know her.

221
00:13:18,744 --> 00:13:20,837
How I'm gonna get to know her,
speakin' that foreign language?

222
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,677
I know all I need to know.

223
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:26,173
You ain't pulled a damn job
since she moved in with you.

224
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:28,187
Look, Uncle Jack,
I can talk to you.

225
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:31,213
-You sure can.
-I can talk to you, right?

226
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:32,724
That's doggone right.

227
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:36,285
-All right, I think--
-What?

228
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:37,694
-I know--
-OK.

229
00:13:37,763 --> 00:13:39,321
-I love her.
-No, no.

230
00:13:39,398 --> 00:13:41,889
Son, son, she wrong for you.
She too decent.

231
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:43,060
What?

232
00:13:43,136 --> 00:13:45,969
Whatever happened to Sharon,
that nice con girl from Chicago?

233
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:47,905
-Two years upstate.
-For what?

234
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,407
-For conning people.
-No.

235
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:52,468
Yeah. But, see, with Sharon,
it was just sex.

236
00:13:52,512 --> 00:13:54,912
-That's good.
-But with Amber...

237
00:13:56,048 --> 00:13:59,506
-Well, it's still sex.
-That's good.

238
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:01,281
-But we talk.
-Talk?

239
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,984
Yes. It's so amazing to wake up
with someone and just talk.

240
00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:09,358
Talk? You ain't Oprah.

241
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:11,488
Hey, honey bun, how are you?

242
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:15,091
-Mmm. How ya doin'?
-All perky and shit.

243
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:19,037
Hey, look what the cat drug in.

244
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:20,572
Hey, something cold
and Bavarian, barkeep.

245
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,267
-You got it, buddy.
-Berger.

246
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:25,735
-Hey, what's up, Kevin dog?
-What's up?

247
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:28,338
Everything's sweet now.

248
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:31,873
Hey, to all the women I loved
and who loved me back. Salud.

249
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:34,284
You better not let Anne Marie
hear you talkin' that shit.

250
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,652
Aw, don't worry, man.
She'll nev--

251
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:38,816
It's Anne Marie.
What, does she have radar?

252
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,357
Berger, best thing
that ever happened to me.

253
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,399
Sweetheart.
Pleasure to meet you, Berger.

254
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:51,926
And any friend of Kevin's
probably works nights.

255
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:54,871
I gotta get back to work myself.
See you later.

256
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:57,467
-It's a delight and a pleasure.
-Sooner than later.

257
00:14:58,744 --> 00:14:59,972
Nice ass.

258
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:02,412
Hey, man, what did I just say?

259
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:04,313
I'm sorry, dog.
I didn't know you meant it.

260
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,580
Come on, most of the girls
you go out with are, you know...

261
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:08,109
Yeah, well,
this one's different.

262
00:15:08,154 --> 00:15:09,781
She got a degree
in anthropology.

263
00:15:09,822 --> 00:15:12,450
I'll remember that if I ever
need to phone a friend, OK?

264
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:14,721
-Do that.
-Hey, Kevin, I got one.

265
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,251
-What?
-Tonight.

266
00:15:17,296 --> 00:15:19,230
Big score. Safe as houses.

267
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:22,291
Safe as houses?
A paradox, as they say.

268
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:24,802
Yes. In fact,
it is a house of which I speak.

269
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:27,237
-Well, talk to me.
-You ever read the papers?

270
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:31,004
I used to,
but the news kept changin'.

271
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:34,035
-Ever hear of Max Fairbanks?
-The big tycoon?

272
00:15:39,785 --> 00:15:41,275
Hey, this better be good.

273
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,015
Oh, you're gonna love this, man.
Check it out.

274
00:15:43,055 --> 00:15:44,454
Come on.
I want you to read that.

275
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,926
"Billionaire Max Fairbanks
today put Trigram real estate...

276
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,895
"a division of T.U.I.,
into Chapter 11."

277
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:52,328
The man's broke,
and we gonna rob him?

278
00:15:52,398 --> 00:15:53,888
Oh, don't cry for him,
Argentina.

279
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:56,332
This man would steal your moms
if he wanted corn bread.

280
00:15:56,369 --> 00:15:58,234
This is one of those
legal heists.

281
00:15:58,271 --> 00:16:00,933
Big business--that's where
they really teach you to steal.

282
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:03,942
No heavy lifting.
Do it while you're on vacation.

283
00:16:03,976 --> 00:16:06,001
And brothers like us
don't even have a dental plan.

284
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:07,535
Come on, read on.

285
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,480
"Under the terms
of the Chapter 11 agreement...

286
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:12,143
"Fairbanks no longer has access
to various properties...

287
00:16:12,184 --> 00:16:13,651
"including West Chop...

"his Marblehead
beach-front residence."

289
00:16:17,556 --> 00:16:20,457
The man can't even
get in his own house?

290
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:30,398
-Always makes me laugh.
-The old upstairs hall light.

291
00:16:30,436 --> 00:16:31,494
Why don't they just
hang out a sign...

292
00:16:31,537 --> 00:16:33,835
"Welcome, burglars.
No one home."

293
00:16:35,374 --> 00:16:38,070
-Here.
-Damn, these are nice.

294
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,236
Aren't they, man?

295
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:40,973
I know a lot of guys who
switched to rubber surgicals...

296
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:44,949
but for comfort and feel,
you can't beat the lsotoner.

297
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:46,952
First class, my man.

298
00:16:46,986 --> 00:16:48,180
First class all the way.

299
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,654
Coming from you,
that means a lot. Serious.

300
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,715
It's all good. Let's do this.

301
00:16:55,594 --> 00:16:58,757
Oh, come on, Max.
You never let me do it.

302
00:16:58,798 --> 00:16:59,958
I'm not done. I have more.

303
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:03,858
God, I can't believe you.

304
00:17:03,903 --> 00:17:06,235
Max, will you please
listen to me?

305
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:11,132
I love the costume.

306
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:12,576
I'm naked.

307
00:17:13,913 --> 00:17:15,608
Oh, a joke.

308
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:17,115
Yeah, a joke.

309
00:17:24,357 --> 00:17:27,656
Ah, baby. I did it. I did it.

310
00:17:29,295 --> 00:17:31,354
What do you say?
What do you say?

311
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,524
Can we please get back to what
we were talking about before?

312
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:36,501
Oh, that. Look...

313
00:17:36,535 --> 00:17:38,059
I think you'd make
a wonderful...

314
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:39,571
entertainment journalist,
Kimberly.

315
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:42,574
Tracey. Tracey Kimberly.

316
00:17:45,544 --> 00:17:47,239
I'm just not sure
I want to talk about it...

317
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:49,873
at this precise moment.

318
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:51,815
You know, I knew you'd say that
once we did it--

319
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:53,751
Don't say
what you're about to say.

320
00:17:53,786 --> 00:17:55,754
Don't turn
a perfectly fun evening...

321
00:17:55,788 --> 00:18:00,589
into something cheap and sordid
by talking business.

322
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:03,958
Here comes the little finger man
coming to get you, hmm?

323
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:07,397
Wow, check that out.
Ooh, look at that.

324
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,901
-Faberge.
-Oh, baby.

325
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:12,802
Gold enamel, diamond inlay.

326
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:14,328
Oh, yeah, I have it now.

327
00:18:14,373 --> 00:18:16,534
Yeah, baby.
And I got the score, baby.

328
00:18:16,575 --> 00:18:18,167
Is that not the score
or what, huh?

329
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:21,839
Fun, too.
Like an Easter egg hunt.

330
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:24,910
You want to hop upstairs,
and I'll just work this floor?

331
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,714
You called it. You called it.

332
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:29,516
Thanks.

333
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:32,217
All right. You wanna do it?
Let's do it. Here we go.

334
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,519
-Really?
-Yeah, sure.

335
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:35,753
Go. Ready? We're gonna do it.

336
00:18:35,828 --> 00:18:40,288
Five, four, three, two...

337
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,699
Titanic heartthrob
Leonardo DiCaprio...

338
00:18:44,737 --> 00:18:48,764
told me, Tracey Kimberly, in
an exclusive E.T. interview...

339
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:50,799
that he is currently
in negotiations...

340
00:18:50,843 --> 00:18:52,902
to do a sequel
to the summer blockbuster...

341
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:56,904
which will be entitled
Titanic 2.

342
00:18:56,949 --> 00:18:58,109
What is it...

343
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,084
the story of a dead guy
on the bottom of the ocean?

344
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,586
Who?

345
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,384
Well, lookie here.

346
00:19:04,423 --> 00:19:06,482
Monday...

347
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,322
Tuesday, Wednesday...

348
00:19:08,394 --> 00:19:09,918
Every day of the week.

349
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:14,429
-What?
-Shh. Quiet. I hear somebody.

350
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:26,168
Oh, yeah. Now we're stylin'.

351
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:32,074
Berger, a tan suede newbuck.

352
00:19:32,117 --> 00:19:34,517
Yeah, I like a thick sole
with a tailored suit.

353
00:19:34,553 --> 00:19:36,578
Grounds it,
know what I'm sayin'?

354
00:19:36,622 --> 00:19:38,249
I do.

355
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:41,856
-Oh, gosh.
-That's why I bought them.

356
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:49,197
Tracey,
come on, get out of here.

357
00:19:49,235 --> 00:19:51,203
What do you think this is,
a photo shoot?

358
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:52,499
But I want to see
what's going on.

359
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:54,369
What does it look like
is going on?

360
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:57,375
The guy's robbing the house.
I got a gun on him.

361
00:19:57,409 --> 00:19:59,274
Go on back in there.
Put your clothes on.

362
00:20:01,146 --> 00:20:02,875
Damn. You must be rich.

363
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:04,644
That's right.
Eat your heart out.

364
00:20:04,683 --> 00:20:08,210
Look, you caught me,
fair and square.

365
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:10,484
But how about
I walk out of here...

366
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:13,117
nothing taken, nothing harmed?
How does that sound?

367
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:15,922
You stay right where you are,
or I shoot you in the head.

368
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:18,520
-How's that sound?
-Violent.

369
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:21,533
But I see your point.

370
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:26,898
-So, he wasn't carrying a gun?
-No, sir.

371
00:20:26,939 --> 00:20:29,134
-No l.D.?
-Nothin'.

372
00:20:29,174 --> 00:20:32,405
-What's your name, bro?
-Petey Wonder.

373
00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:36,772
I'm Stevie's little brother...

374
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,647
but I don't sing.

375
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:40,982
You know who I am?

376
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,988
You got a lot of balls, huh?

377
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:46,890
You come into my house,
into my bedroom...

378
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:48,984
and take my ring.

379
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:50,722
-What?
-That's my ring.

380
00:20:50,796 --> 00:20:53,060
Stop trippin', all right?
This is my ring.

381
00:20:53,098 --> 00:20:55,760
Ha! Son of a bitch! He was gonna
waltz out of here...

382
00:20:55,801 --> 00:20:57,132
with my ring
on his little finger.

383
00:20:57,169 --> 00:20:59,228
Take off the ring,
give it to Mr. Fairbanks.

384
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:01,000
-Officer, this is my ring.
-Sure. Give him the ring.

385
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,008
Look, my girlfriend
gave me the ring.

386
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:04,532
If I don't come home
with my ring--

387
00:21:04,577 --> 00:21:07,205
Give me the ring. Give me it.

388
00:21:07,246 --> 00:21:08,645
This is my ring.

389
00:21:10,282 --> 00:21:12,375
You expect us to believe that?

390
00:21:12,418 --> 00:21:14,511
You...

391
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:21,059
I can go along
with some things, but...

392
00:21:21,093 --> 00:21:24,392
some things make no damn sense.

393
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,194
-Let go of the damn ring.
-This ain't right.

394
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:30,295
Write a letter to the editor.

395
00:21:30,336 --> 00:21:34,466
Oop. I forgot.
I own the newspapers.

396
00:21:34,506 --> 00:21:36,974
We'll take care of everything.

397
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:38,738
Get him out of here.

398
00:21:38,777 --> 00:21:40,108
Don't you worry,
Mr. Fairbanks.

399
00:21:40,145 --> 00:21:42,636
This is a good ring.

400
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:45,309
This is a very nice ring.

401
00:21:48,454 --> 00:21:51,446
All right, just hear me out, OK?
One more time.

402
00:21:51,523 --> 00:21:54,083
I just feel if we were
to go back, you know...

403
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,219
and, uh, give him
a chance to confess...

404
00:21:57,296 --> 00:21:58,627
you know, come clean...

405
00:21:58,664 --> 00:22:03,829
he might just hand over what is
in fact my rightful property.

406
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:06,360
I could see how that sounds
all messed up, right?

407
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:07,599
Comin' out of my mouth.

408
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,471
But it's the truth.

409
00:22:09,508 --> 00:22:11,635
Can I see my lawyer?

410
00:22:11,677 --> 00:22:14,009
Seventeen,
with the robbery suspect...

411
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:16,071
at Twenty-five Harbor Heights,
Marblehead...

412
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:17,639
what's your twenty?

413
00:22:18,651 --> 00:22:21,142
Yeah. That's it, 10-4. We're on
the corner of Camden and 4th...

414
00:22:21,186 --> 00:22:23,211
en route to the station
with the perp in custody.

415
00:22:24,356 --> 00:22:27,621
What? Hey! Hey, you! Stop!

416
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:31,595
Shit! What's going on?

417
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,188
That son of a bitch!

418
00:22:57,956 --> 00:22:59,548
Anything?

419
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,058
Nothing. Clear. Let's go.

420
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:25,982
I want my damn ring!

421
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:31,184
You don't know what you started.

422
00:23:55,948 --> 00:23:58,473
I'll take door number three.

423
00:24:02,755 --> 00:24:04,188
Gotta go!

424
00:24:19,304 --> 00:24:22,273
Hello, honey bun.
How was your day?

425
00:24:22,307 --> 00:24:24,241
Good.

426
00:24:30,282 --> 00:24:32,273
What's the matter?

427
00:24:36,588 --> 00:24:37,748
Well, was it bad?

428
00:24:42,895 --> 00:24:44,055
Go on.

429
00:24:47,065 --> 00:24:48,692
I lost the ring.

430
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:55,629
Oh, Kevin,
I just gave you the ring.

431
00:24:55,674 --> 00:24:59,337
Well, actually, it's worse
than that. The ring was stolen.

432
00:24:59,378 --> 00:25:01,346
Stolen by who?

433
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:05,248
Of all the lousy, jerkological,
cheap-shot stickups...

434
00:25:05,284 --> 00:25:06,410
this has gotta take the cake.

435
00:25:06,451 --> 00:25:09,477
-You got that right.
-Robbed by a householder...

436
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:11,580
doing a robbery.

437
00:25:11,623 --> 00:25:15,081
Terrible, Kevin, terrible.

438
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:17,262
-You laughing at me?
-Hell, yeah, I'm laughing.

439
00:25:17,262 --> 00:25:20,288
It's embarrassing. You should be
ashamed of yourself.

440
00:25:20,332 --> 00:25:21,594
Sixteen thousand.

441
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:23,396
What's in that cigar
you're smoking, huh?

442
00:25:23,435 --> 00:25:26,165
Come on, the Fabergé egg alone--

443
00:25:26,238 --> 00:25:27,500
Nice. Don't want it.
It's hard to move.

444
00:25:27,573 --> 00:25:30,440
-Can't move it.
-The damn car, OK?

445
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:31,567
It's worth--

446
00:25:31,643 --> 00:25:34,669
OK, I'll give you six and a half
for the car.

447
00:25:34,746 --> 00:25:36,839
Round it off to twenty-one five.

448
00:25:36,882 --> 00:25:38,782
That's because
I raised you as my own...

449
00:25:38,817 --> 00:25:41,877
and I'm happy to see you
back in the business.

450
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,649
-Sixteen.
-Sixteen.

451
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:47,352
-Plus six and a half.
-Half, right.

452
00:25:47,392 --> 00:25:50,452
-Is twenty-one five?
-Man, look. Six...

453
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,755
Twenty-one, fifteen, twenty...

454
00:25:54,867 --> 00:25:56,357
Don't worry about it.

455
00:25:58,036 --> 00:25:59,628
Look here, it's late, all right?

456
00:25:59,705 --> 00:26:01,605
I wanted to see
if you're on your game...

457
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,074
so I took a shot at you.
That's all I did.

458
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:05,906
Man...

459
00:26:05,944 --> 00:26:08,435
I just feel like I'm getting
robbed by everybody tonight.

460
00:26:11,917 --> 00:26:14,078
Come on, Kevin,
it's not that bad.

461
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:16,644
Why are you so upset?

462
00:26:16,688 --> 00:26:18,485
Why am I so upset?

463
00:26:19,691 --> 00:26:21,818
Baby, let me show you something.

464
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,987
You see this?

465
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:28,193
This is a Fabergé egg--
Russian, 1890.

466
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:32,135
Now, some people get all freaked
and obsessed by these.

467
00:26:32,204 --> 00:26:35,196
Why?
It's what it represents.

468
00:26:35,274 --> 00:26:37,708
Power, taste, superiority.

469
00:26:37,743 --> 00:26:39,005
That's all in the mind...

470
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:41,638
of the person
who puts a price on it.

471
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,080
What's it mean to me?

472
00:26:44,116 --> 00:26:45,708
Not a damn thing.

473
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:48,219
Too hard to fence.

474
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:51,222
Now, the ring,
on the other hand...

475
00:26:51,256 --> 00:26:52,848
is priceless.

476
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:56,725
It symbolizes
the day my life changed--

477
00:26:56,762 --> 00:26:58,423
the day I met you.

478
00:26:58,463 --> 00:27:00,158
Wow.

479
00:27:08,607 --> 00:27:10,040
Let's go, Monty.
Let's see what you got.

480
00:27:13,946 --> 00:27:16,141
Ooh, bull's-eye!

481
00:27:16,181 --> 00:27:17,808
Game, set, match.

482
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:24,422
Do we have a problem?

483
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:26,287
No. You have a problem...

484
00:27:26,325 --> 00:27:28,623
from which l,
your long suffering attorney...

485
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,527
will once again
try to extricate you.

486
00:27:31,563 --> 00:27:33,895
-So?
-So...

487
00:27:33,932 --> 00:27:35,399
there was a break-in last night.

488
00:27:35,434 --> 00:27:38,460
Oh, no. You're kidding.
Really?

489
00:27:38,537 --> 00:27:40,698
Hmm. Did they get much?

490
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:43,969
A hundred fifty thousand dollars
in valuables, plus a car.

491
00:27:44,042 --> 00:27:47,034
That's right, Max. He went back.

492
00:27:48,814 --> 00:27:51,681
-Son of a bitch.
-Sir!

493
00:27:51,717 --> 00:27:53,241
Shut up.

494
00:27:54,619 --> 00:27:58,282
Does Lutetia
know about the, uh...

495
00:27:58,323 --> 00:28:00,416
About the young lady?
So far not.

496
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:02,689
You've got bigger problems, Max.

497
00:28:02,728 --> 00:28:04,958
The bankruptcy judge
is furious...

498
00:28:04,997 --> 00:28:06,658
you disobeyed his order
not to use the house.

499
00:28:06,698 --> 00:28:10,566
Can't you use a seedy motel,
like a normal philanderer?

500
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:16,273
What's so funny?

501
00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:17,707
I was thinking
about the robbery.

502
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:19,210
Something funny
about the robbery?

503
00:28:19,244 --> 00:28:21,712
Yeah, yeah, Walter, there is.

504
00:28:22,881 --> 00:28:24,815
You think that shit's funny?

505
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,909
He boosted your ring
right in front of the cops?

506
00:28:29,187 --> 00:28:30,882
Come on, you got to see
the humor in it, please.

507
00:28:30,922 --> 00:28:32,651
I don't.
I don't see the humor.

508
00:28:32,691 --> 00:28:35,990
I robbed a thief. How could you
not see the humor in that?

509
00:28:36,028 --> 00:28:37,461
Because it's not funny.

510
00:28:37,496 --> 00:28:40,260
It's more than just funny,
Walter. It's fate.

511
00:28:40,298 --> 00:28:42,994
Here.
Take a look at this symbol.

512
00:28:43,035 --> 00:28:45,697
It's my company logo
from the I Ching.

513
00:28:47,672 --> 00:28:50,641
Omens, signs, throwing bones...

514
00:28:50,675 --> 00:28:53,940
I don't throw bones, Walter,
but I do throw coins.

515
00:28:53,979 --> 00:28:56,311
And I've been using the I Ching
for twenty years...

516
00:28:56,348 --> 00:28:58,179
and look where it's got me.

517
00:28:58,216 --> 00:28:59,911
This ring...

518
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:02,385
is a sign.

519
00:29:02,421 --> 00:29:05,515
Everything
is gonna be just fine...

520
00:29:05,557 --> 00:29:09,254
as long as I hold on
to this lucky ring.

521
00:29:10,762 --> 00:29:12,286
Don't worry.
We'll get your ring back.

522
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,628
-Fairbanks is big game.
-Right.

523
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:16,099
We need a big game hunter.

524
00:29:17,903 --> 00:29:19,302
Shelly Nix.

525
00:29:24,142 --> 00:29:27,168
Shut the fuck up, man.

526
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:28,371
Thank you.

527
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:29,539
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

528
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:32,015
Can you find this asshole
or not?

529
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,210
Piece of cake.

530
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:35,082
It's no harder than shutting
down A.O.L. for an hour.

531
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,985
Not that I'd have any interest.

532
00:29:37,022 --> 00:29:39,081
All right. Check it out, y'all.

533
00:29:39,124 --> 00:29:40,819
Usually, when you're trying
to track somebody down...

534
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:43,157
what you want to do is start
with airline computers...

535
00:29:43,195 --> 00:29:46,494
car rental companies, big hotel
chains, stuff like that.

536
00:29:46,531 --> 00:29:48,829
This guy's a high roller.
He's got his own personal jet...

537
00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:51,427
so it's nothing
but private limos...

538
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,665
and corporate hotel suites
from there on out.

539
00:29:53,738 --> 00:29:55,035
How do you find him?

540
00:29:55,107 --> 00:29:57,667
He's got a personal assistant
right here in Boston.

541
00:29:57,742 --> 00:30:00,267
She e-mails his itineraries,
his schedules.

542
00:30:00,345 --> 00:30:02,813
She practically knows
every detail of this guy's life.

543
00:30:02,848 --> 00:30:04,338
Her name is Gloria.

544
00:30:09,955 --> 00:30:11,183
The ring I told you about--

545
00:30:11,223 --> 00:30:14,249
I'm more convinced than ever
it's major mojo.

546
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:15,782
You know...

547
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:18,091
I wouldn't tell
anybody else this but you.

548
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,722
What, my musky teddy bear?

549
00:30:19,764 --> 00:30:22,756
Tell mama.
You can tell mama bear anything.

550
00:30:22,801 --> 00:30:24,268
Mama bear don't care.

551
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:26,293
Gloria, stop it.
We've discussed this already.

552
00:30:26,338 --> 00:30:28,806
Screw you, Max.
Promises were made.

553
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,307
-Gloria.
-Never mind.

554
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,842
The past is the past.

555
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:33,742
What can I do for you, sir?

556
00:30:33,778 --> 00:30:37,578
I was saying I was beginning
to go into one of my dips.

557
00:30:37,616 --> 00:30:41,177
I was feeling
fear and anxiety and--

558
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:45,315
But this ring is like a sign
everything's turning around.

559
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:47,848
I was just wondering if,
you know, you could confirm--

560
00:30:47,893 --> 00:30:50,191
All right, Max. All right.

561
00:30:51,696 --> 00:30:55,427
Nine in the second place.
Tread a level course.

562
00:30:55,467 --> 00:30:59,961
The perseverance of a dark man
brings good fortune.

563
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:02,768
Judgment, treading upon
the tale of the tiger...

564
00:31:02,841 --> 00:31:04,331
it does not bite man.

565
00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:06,377
What did the Boston Herald
just call me?

566
00:31:06,411 --> 00:31:07,776
"The dark prince of plunder."

567
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:10,042
Perseverance of the dark man--
that's me.

568
00:31:10,081 --> 00:31:11,639
Well, maybe.

569
00:31:11,683 --> 00:31:13,116
Treading on the tiger's tale.

570
00:31:13,151 --> 00:31:14,948
Taking mad chances
and getting away with it.

571
00:31:14,986 --> 00:31:17,614
Like that time we were
in the elevator at T.U.I.?

572
00:31:19,925 --> 00:31:22,485
Focus, Gloria, focus.

573
00:31:22,527 --> 00:31:24,358
Let me consult my cards.

574
00:31:24,396 --> 00:31:25,590
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

575
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,689
I will, Max.
It takes a little time.

576
00:31:32,571 --> 00:31:34,630
What? What? Gloria, what?

577
00:31:34,706 --> 00:31:36,936
-Max, I'm losing you.
-Gloria, what?

578
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:38,100
You're cutting out.
I can't hear you.

579
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:40,011
I hope you got the e-mail that
Lutetia wants you to call her.

580
00:31:40,011 --> 00:31:41,146
Lutetia? What does she want?

581
00:31:41,146 --> 00:31:42,477
Lutetia? What does she want?

582
00:31:42,514 --> 00:31:44,607
The only person he's afraid of
is his wife Lutetia.

583
00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:46,981
Here she is--
Design Times, June '98.

584
00:31:47,052 --> 00:31:50,021
Beacon Hill townhouse
of Max and Lutetia Fairbanks.

585
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:53,717
Damn. Lutetia
looks more like Morticia.

586
00:31:53,758 --> 00:31:55,692
What the hell were you doing
at the beach house...

587
00:31:55,727 --> 00:31:58,457
and who the hell
were you doing it with?

588
00:31:58,496 --> 00:32:01,192
Scandal and disease, Max.
These are the deal-breakers.

589
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:02,359
I'm a monk.

590
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,890
Just because
you have the hairstyle...

591
00:32:03,935 --> 00:32:05,197
doesn't mean
you lead the lifestyle.

592
00:32:05,237 --> 00:32:08,263
And take off your shoes--
the white carpet.

593
00:32:08,306 --> 00:32:11,639
Oh. Tell me again.
Why did I marry you?

594
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:13,337
Because I grew up
on Beacon Hill...

595
00:32:13,378 --> 00:32:15,869
which gave you entrée
to wealthy family friends...

596
00:32:15,914 --> 00:32:18,075
who could invest
in all your business ventures.

597
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:19,515
And you had a great ass.

598
00:32:19,584 --> 00:32:21,518
Oh. Have a great ass.

599
00:32:21,553 --> 00:32:22,918
Don't forget.

600
00:32:22,954 --> 00:32:25,115
Picker is hosting
the botanical garden benefit...

601
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,658
at the Sheraton Boston tonight
honoring me.

602
00:32:27,726 --> 00:32:30,718
I'd like to pay tribute
right now.

603
00:32:30,762 --> 00:32:31,990
Come over here.

604
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,622
Six o'clock sharp.

605
00:32:33,665 --> 00:32:36,463
Picker hates it
when you're late.

606
00:32:36,501 --> 00:32:40,028
Right.
Picker first, pecker later.

607
00:32:42,841 --> 00:32:44,399
Boy, I need a massage.

608
00:32:45,944 --> 00:32:48,674
Ah, hold up, hold up.
E-mail from Gloria--

609
00:32:48,713 --> 00:32:52,080
benefit tonight at the Sheraton
Boston with his wife. Nice.

610
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,210
Let the games begin.
Ha ha. Yeah, Kevin.

611
00:32:55,287 --> 00:32:56,686
Hell, yeah, baby.

612
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:59,588
Very hip, very cool.

613
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:01,148
Very Vegas in the sixties.

614
00:33:02,427 --> 00:33:05,055
But how about you come over here
and we mess it up a little bit?

615
00:33:05,096 --> 00:33:06,620
Let me entertain you first.

616
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:14,167
Give me dollars,
give me dollars.

617
00:33:14,205 --> 00:33:16,264
Put 'em here.
Twenties go here...

618
00:33:16,308 --> 00:33:17,775
hundreds go here.

619
00:33:17,876 --> 00:33:19,366
During her eight years...

620
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:22,073
of involvement
with the botanical garden...

621
00:33:22,113 --> 00:33:25,810
she has impressed us all with
her generosity and enthusiasm.

622
00:33:30,522 --> 00:33:32,547
Evening. Evening.

623
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:33,750
Evening, sir.

624
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:36,891
Lutetia Fairbanks.

625
00:33:44,502 --> 00:33:46,561
What's happening,
birdie, birdie?

626
00:33:46,604 --> 00:33:48,231
You a talking bird?

627
00:33:48,273 --> 00:33:51,299
Say, "Max, that's your ass."
Ooh!

628
00:33:51,343 --> 00:33:54,176
Ooh, I'm sorry. Ladies!

629
00:33:54,212 --> 00:33:57,238
Where have y'all been?
Lookin' good.

630
00:33:57,282 --> 00:33:59,842
You know, I haven't seen y'all
since my polo accident.

631
00:33:59,918 --> 00:34:01,215
Who does your eyes?

632
00:34:01,286 --> 00:34:05,985
Yeah, yeah. Look at y'all.
Mucho eleganté.

633
00:34:06,024 --> 00:34:07,753
Thank you.

634
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:09,157
And thank you all
for coming tonight...

635
00:34:09,194 --> 00:34:10,889
and for
your ongoing commitment...

636
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:13,295
to the Boston
Botanical Foundation.

637
00:34:13,331 --> 00:34:15,959
We have all sorts
of exciting plans lined up...

638
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,833
none of which would be possible
without your generosity...

639
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,896
Let me ask you something.

640
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,908
Is that Mrs. Fairbanks up there?

641
00:34:23,942 --> 00:34:25,807
Their tireless team
of volunteers...

642
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:27,709
'Cause I'm confused.
I thought Mrs. Fairbanks...

643
00:34:27,746 --> 00:34:33,707
was a young brunette
with, like, big soapy titties.

644
00:34:33,752 --> 00:34:36,687
You're here to blackmail me?

645
00:34:36,721 --> 00:34:38,882
Be cool.

646
00:34:38,957 --> 00:34:40,686
I'm just here
to get back my ring, OK?

647
00:34:40,725 --> 00:34:42,693
That's my lucky ring,
and I want it back.

648
00:34:42,727 --> 00:34:46,356
No, it's not,
because now it's my lucky ring.

649
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:49,094
Spoils of war.

650
00:34:50,902 --> 00:34:52,369
It means something to me.

651
00:34:52,404 --> 00:34:54,338
Well, it means something
to me, too...

652
00:34:54,372 --> 00:34:56,306
because I took it
off a little pissant...

653
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:57,501
who broke into my house...

654
00:34:57,542 --> 00:34:59,567
while I was trying to nail
Miss September.

655
00:35:00,678 --> 00:35:01,975
That was Miss September?

656
00:35:02,013 --> 00:35:03,810
Yeah, it was Miss September.

657
00:35:03,848 --> 00:35:06,783
Oh, damn. I got that issue.

658
00:35:10,555 --> 00:35:11,852
So how rich are you?

659
00:35:16,895 --> 00:35:18,726
You know...

660
00:35:18,763 --> 00:35:20,731
it's guys like you
think you can just...

661
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:23,131
take whatever you want,
don't you?

662
00:35:23,168 --> 00:35:26,228
-Guys like me?
-Yeah.

663
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:28,239
Who's the thief here?

664
00:35:30,942 --> 00:35:32,341
I want my damn ring.

665
00:35:32,377 --> 00:35:34,345
Well, you can't have
your damn ring.

666
00:35:45,623 --> 00:35:46,749
You're gonna regret this.

667
00:35:53,898 --> 00:35:55,627
Excuse me.

668
00:35:58,303 --> 00:36:00,203
Total stranger.

669
00:36:00,238 --> 00:36:01,796
Trés bizarre.

670
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,273
Are you gonna eat that?

671
00:36:03,308 --> 00:36:04,832
I'm telling you, man.

672
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:06,776
When--when word gets out...

673
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:09,405
everybody
is gonna be laughing at me.

674
00:36:09,447 --> 00:36:11,540
That's it.
His ass is going down.

675
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:14,814
-Take him down, man.
-Millionaire, billionaire.

676
00:36:14,886 --> 00:36:16,217
It don't even matter.
He's out the game.

677
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:18,381
When I see him, what's up?
Pow! Boom !

678
00:36:18,456 --> 00:36:20,253
But you know what?
That's just the start.

679
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:22,555
Guess where else I'm going.
I'm gonna do the ghetto smack.

680
00:36:22,594 --> 00:36:25,028
-Oh, the ghetto smack.
-What's the ghetto smack?

681
00:36:25,063 --> 00:36:27,031
Well, you hit him with anything.

682
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:28,623
Drum set, bam !

683
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:31,134
Piano, pow!

684
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:32,295
Stop it!

685
00:36:32,337 --> 00:36:34,066
Sorry to break up the party...

686
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:37,074
but I thought you were trying
to get the ring back for me.

687
00:36:39,677 --> 00:36:42,805
Yeah, baby. That's right.

688
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:44,405
Kevin, are you blinking?

689
00:36:45,817 --> 00:36:49,412
No. What it was, right--
I had something in my eye.

690
00:36:49,487 --> 00:36:51,079
See, probably right here.

691
00:36:51,155 --> 00:36:53,282
-See?
-I think I got it for you.

692
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:55,189
Oh, yeah, it's gone.

693
00:36:55,226 --> 00:36:57,820
Do me a favor.
Keep out of trouble, will you?

694
00:36:57,862 --> 00:36:59,489
No doubt.

695
00:36:59,531 --> 00:37:02,227
Baby letting you know
when something in your eye.

696
00:37:03,368 --> 00:37:05,097
-What you got?
-Check it out.

697
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:07,195
He and his wife are going
to some cocktail party...

698
00:37:07,238 --> 00:37:09,468
ending by 8:00,
home by about 8:30.

699
00:37:09,507 --> 00:37:11,407
Yeah, we'll be there
waiting for him.

700
00:37:11,442 --> 00:37:13,433
Take the ring right off
his finger in his own home.

701
00:37:13,478 --> 00:37:15,571
And before that?

702
00:37:15,613 --> 00:37:19,276
A complete removal
of all things portable.

703
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,285
I'm sure we can work this out,
Judge Callahan...

704
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,617
if you just look
in your file there.

705
00:37:23,655 --> 00:37:25,953
You have a sworn statement
from my client...

706
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,754
stating that he only went back
to the house in question...

707
00:37:28,793 --> 00:37:31,318
to pick up
some very important stuff.

708
00:37:31,362 --> 00:37:32,488
Very important stuff.

709
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,998
I have a good idea
what he picked up there.

710
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:36,500
Oh, you do, do you?

711
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:39,697
You don't think the rules apply
to you, do you, Mr. Fairbanks?

712
00:37:39,737 --> 00:37:41,637
What?
What's he talking about?

713
00:37:41,673 --> 00:37:44,801
All right, all right, all right,
that's enough.

714
00:37:44,842 --> 00:37:46,036
Since you defied my order...

715
00:37:46,077 --> 00:37:47,772
not to enter
the Marblehead beach house...

716
00:37:47,812 --> 00:37:49,109
I have a good mind to reopen...

717
00:37:49,147 --> 00:37:51,980
the entire Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceeding.

718
00:37:52,016 --> 00:37:54,382
You know, you weren't so cocky
when you came to me...

719
00:37:54,452 --> 00:37:57,114
with your hand out
asking me for money.

720
00:37:57,188 --> 00:37:58,655
What did you say, Mr. Fairbanks?

721
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:01,557
You think I forgot how much
it cost me to get you elected...

722
00:38:01,593 --> 00:38:02,719
by spreading stories...

723
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,285
about your opponent's
sexual preferences?

724
00:38:07,332 --> 00:38:09,323
Oh, get some money.

725
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:10,834
I fork over, and what do you do?

726
00:38:10,868 --> 00:38:12,893
You sit there
like a big, fat blob!

727
00:38:13,938 --> 00:38:16,907
-Sell the house!
-Up yours, you fat pig!

728
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:19,603
And all the contents
at public auction.

729
00:38:20,745 --> 00:38:22,406
Max, what did you get
so crazy for?

730
00:38:22,447 --> 00:38:25,041
I'll tell you. He forgot
who the hell he paid off.

731
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:27,244
It was the other judge.
I told you.

732
00:38:27,318 --> 00:38:31,015
Tread a level course.
You don't listen to me anymore.

733
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:32,920
So I forgot
we backed the other mutt.

734
00:38:32,957 --> 00:38:34,390
Boy, this guy holds a grudge.

735
00:38:34,425 --> 00:38:35,915
Max, you get one final visit...

736
00:38:35,994 --> 00:38:38,360
to gather and remove
any personal effects.

737
00:38:38,396 --> 00:38:39,761
-One final visit?
-Yep.

738
00:38:39,797 --> 00:38:42,630
Max, I could come along
if you need some help.

739
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:45,431
Thanks just the same.
Dial Miss September.

740
00:38:56,648 --> 00:38:59,617
Everything's gonna be fine.
The car will be here any second.

741
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:02,279
we'll go to Missy's party,
and we'll leave early.

742
00:39:02,353 --> 00:39:05,049
-Right.
-Don't be so down, Maxie.

743
00:39:05,123 --> 00:39:07,455
We still have
an awful lot of houses left.

744
00:39:07,492 --> 00:39:09,983
Move your ass, Berger.
Don't start dragging on me.

745
00:39:10,061 --> 00:39:12,427
-I got a bad feeling, Kevin.
-Come on.

746
00:39:14,098 --> 00:39:15,725
Something's not right, man,
I'm telling you.

747
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:18,133
The only thing's not right
is you run out on me again, OK?

748
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:20,399
-I'm talking violence.
-I'm not leaving you, baby.

749
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:22,269
You can't get rid of me, man.
We're partners.

750
00:39:22,306 --> 00:39:25,070
We're like Shaq and Kobe.
We're like Pippen and Jordan.

751
00:39:25,109 --> 00:39:26,474
We're like
Rodgers and Hammerstein.

752
00:39:26,511 --> 00:39:29,036
Ann Marie's been making me go
to theater lately.

753
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,345
-OK, I'm on the alarm.
-All right, good.

754
00:39:35,353 --> 00:39:37,344
Alarm disabled.

755
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:39,981
And we're in.

756
00:39:40,058 --> 00:39:41,592
Yeah, baby.

757
00:39:44,962 --> 00:39:46,862
This is right out
of a Hitchcock movie.

758
00:39:46,898 --> 00:39:48,092
I'm getting vertigo.

759
00:39:48,132 --> 00:39:51,863
What's on your mind, Max?
Tell me.

760
00:39:51,936 --> 00:39:53,028
Oh, it's that bum of a judge.

761
00:39:53,104 --> 00:39:55,299
He's allowing me
one last visit to Marblehead...

762
00:39:55,373 --> 00:39:56,806
to collect my belongings.

763
00:39:58,209 --> 00:40:00,905
I thought maybe after the party,
I'd drop you off home...

764
00:40:00,945 --> 00:40:04,972
and I'd go on out
for one last overnight.

765
00:40:07,085 --> 00:40:10,077
You know what?
You've been through a lot today.

766
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:11,588
Let's forget about the party.

767
00:40:11,622 --> 00:40:13,920
You go get your things.

768
00:40:16,461 --> 00:40:18,429
Nobody knows me like you,
Lutetia.

769
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,831
All right.

770
00:40:26,904 --> 00:40:29,600
OK, sounds good.

771
00:40:29,674 --> 00:40:32,939
I'll just throw a few things
in an overnight bag.

772
00:40:32,977 --> 00:40:34,945
-That's them, man.
-I'll come with you.

773
00:40:34,979 --> 00:40:36,810
What?

774
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:39,610
In the elevator.

775
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,015
What the hell
are they doing back?

776
00:40:41,052 --> 00:40:42,212
I don't know.

777
00:40:42,253 --> 00:40:44,847
And then on to the beach house.

778
00:40:44,889 --> 00:40:47,016
But--but, uh...

779
00:40:47,058 --> 00:40:49,652
You know, there's no sense in
both of us going to the beach.

780
00:40:49,694 --> 00:40:52,322
I insist.
That's the whole point...

781
00:40:53,998 --> 00:40:56,159
It's been discussed. I'm going.

782
00:40:57,535 --> 00:40:59,332
They're gone.

783
00:41:03,274 --> 00:41:05,071
You don't even like
the beach house.

784
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:06,303
It's so suburban.

785
00:41:06,344 --> 00:41:09,177
You are in a fragile state.

786
00:41:09,213 --> 00:41:11,807
I can't bear to think of you
out there all alone.

787
00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:13,646
Come on.

788
00:41:13,684 --> 00:41:15,549
It'll be fun.

789
00:41:15,586 --> 00:41:17,554
I--Give me a minute.

790
00:41:17,588 --> 00:41:19,920
-Where the hell did they go?
-I don't know.

791
00:41:27,665 --> 00:41:29,826
Dial Miss September.

792
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,674
Dial Miss September!

793
00:41:39,477 --> 00:41:42,275
Tracey, forget about tonight.

794
00:41:42,313 --> 00:41:44,144
Let's go, Max!

795
00:41:44,182 --> 00:41:46,582
They're up there.
Come on, move it.

796
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:49,952
Hold it.

797
00:41:49,987 --> 00:41:51,955
Sounds like there are voices
coming from the wall.

798
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:54,253
-Yeah, I don't get it.
-Stop. I'm going.

799
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,421
It's not too late
to change your mind.

800
00:41:57,461 --> 00:41:58,951
Stop it. I insist.

801
00:42:03,401 --> 00:42:04,527
Damn!

802
00:42:04,602 --> 00:42:06,229
Quick, the alarm.
We gotta hurry.

803
00:42:06,304 --> 00:42:09,034
Engage in three, two, one...

804
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:13,734
Damn.

805
00:42:13,811 --> 00:42:15,938
Move one inch, and we're done.

806
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,813
There are motion detectors
everywhere.

807
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:20,943
Tell me about it, Berger.

808
00:42:20,985 --> 00:42:22,612
Help me.

809
00:42:24,622 --> 00:42:26,249
You sound like The Fly.

810
00:42:28,092 --> 00:42:29,320
I'm sorry.

811
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,726
-I gotta call Windham.
-Hurry!

812
00:42:33,464 --> 00:42:34,761
Windham !

813
00:42:34,899 --> 00:42:36,958
Shut up! Just shut up!

814
00:42:37,001 --> 00:42:38,662
I'm telling you right now,
the brakes are shot!

815
00:42:38,736 --> 00:42:40,897
Shut up, will you?
You are making me nervous.

816
00:42:40,972 --> 00:42:43,099
You were born nervous, and
you're making me more nervous.

817
00:42:43,174 --> 00:42:45,938
-Could you please?
-That rabbit is brand-new!

818
00:42:45,977 --> 00:42:47,342
I can't be spending my time
running around getting--

819
00:42:47,378 --> 00:42:50,347
Will you quiet down? I'm trying
to break in to this place.

820
00:42:50,381 --> 00:42:53,248
How dare you drive that fast
when we got kids in the car.

821
00:42:53,284 --> 00:42:55,946
Don't yell. I was barely
going over the speed limit.

822
00:42:55,987 --> 00:42:57,511
Where the hell is he?

823
00:42:57,555 --> 00:43:00,353
I can't hold on much longer.

824
00:43:00,391 --> 00:43:01,585
I feel that way, too...

825
00:43:01,626 --> 00:43:03,685
'cause my legs are dead.

826
00:43:03,728 --> 00:43:05,855
I can't feel my ankles...

827
00:43:05,897 --> 00:43:07,831
my knees...

828
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:12,666
Uh, my calf is swollen.

829
00:43:12,737 --> 00:43:14,398
Kevin, I know this is not
the time to tell you this...

830
00:43:14,472 --> 00:43:17,703
but I didn't have to pee
until right now.

831
00:43:17,742 --> 00:43:20,233
Let it go, man. I won't tell.

832
00:43:20,311 --> 00:43:22,176
That's what you said last time.

833
00:43:22,213 --> 00:43:24,875
Why is it every time Kevin calls
we gotta drop everything...

834
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:27,009
but anytime I call,
you pretend you can't hear me?

835
00:43:27,051 --> 00:43:28,643
Maybe because I like Kevin.

836
00:43:28,686 --> 00:43:31,052
You take that back, or you'll
never saw me in half again.

837
00:43:31,088 --> 00:43:32,350
We want ice cream !

838
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:34,358
You kids want to disappear?
I can make that happen!

839
00:43:34,392 --> 00:43:36,952
Do not upset your father,
you get it?

840
00:43:36,994 --> 00:43:38,859
I can never find
the right damn key.

841
00:43:40,564 --> 00:43:41,690
Say thank you.

842
00:43:41,732 --> 00:43:43,131
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

843
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:45,362
Yo, I need your help, man.
This bag is too damn heavy.

844
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:46,596
I need your help, man.

845
00:43:46,671 --> 00:43:49,799
I'm trying to help myself.
I can't even move my neck.

846
00:43:49,874 --> 00:43:52,001
Oh, man,
this thing's unbelievable.

847
00:43:52,076 --> 00:43:54,977
-I got the numbers, honey.
-I got the lock.

848
00:43:55,012 --> 00:43:56,479
You're the wind
beneath my wings.

849
00:43:56,514 --> 00:43:58,072
Alarm disabled.

850
00:43:58,115 --> 00:43:59,480
Security disarmed.

851
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:04,884
OK, she's fixed.

852
00:44:04,922 --> 00:44:08,380
I can't feel my ass.
Numby-numb.

853
00:44:09,927 --> 00:44:12,054
Yeah, can you believe it?
Me and Edwina together...

854
00:44:12,096 --> 00:44:13,324
ten years this September.

855
00:44:13,364 --> 00:44:14,490
Yeah, ten's a big number.

856
00:44:14,532 --> 00:44:16,022
We're gonna have
a big anniversary party.

857
00:44:16,067 --> 00:44:17,193
We hope you can make it.
There's gonna be--

858
00:44:17,234 --> 00:44:19,259
-Come on!
-Shut up!

859
00:44:19,337 --> 00:44:22,238
Sure. I should be walking again
by September.

860
00:44:22,273 --> 00:44:23,570
I can't believe
it lasted ten years.

861
00:44:23,607 --> 00:44:25,268
I couldn't even last
ten minutes with her.

862
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:34,875
Damn, this is nice stuff.

863
00:44:34,919 --> 00:44:38,013
First quality, top drawer.

864
00:44:38,055 --> 00:44:39,386
I can do one of two things.

865
00:44:39,423 --> 00:44:41,914
I can give you
two hundred grand cash now...

866
00:44:41,959 --> 00:44:43,551
or, if you're willing
to trust me...

867
00:44:43,594 --> 00:44:45,255
I could pretty much guarantee
that I can fence...

868
00:44:45,296 --> 00:44:48,060
most of the valuable stuff
for a much larger figure...

869
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:50,329
and square up
with you guys later.

870
00:44:50,368 --> 00:44:51,892
It's totally up to you.

871
00:44:54,572 --> 00:44:56,403
We'll take the cash.

872
00:45:08,285 --> 00:45:09,752
Still no luck.

873
00:45:11,489 --> 00:45:13,389
Total failure.

874
00:45:17,428 --> 00:45:19,692
About sixty Gs.

875
00:45:21,232 --> 00:45:24,292
Oh, I got something for you.

876
00:45:28,005 --> 00:45:30,496
I knew it was
your favorite color.

877
00:45:30,574 --> 00:45:32,701
It's beautiful.

878
00:45:37,348 --> 00:45:41,341
Oh, my God!

879
00:45:41,385 --> 00:45:43,216
Where is my painting?

880
00:45:43,254 --> 00:45:44,687
-Gone.
-I can't believe--

881
00:45:44,722 --> 00:45:47,213
Who would do something
like this?

882
00:45:47,258 --> 00:45:50,386
That sneak thief.
Don't look down.

883
00:45:54,865 --> 00:45:56,799
Oh, hey, get some water,
Gloria...

884
00:45:56,834 --> 00:45:59,496
and shut that damn dog up
before I do.

885
00:46:00,771 --> 00:46:03,296
Park it there, OK.

886
00:46:03,374 --> 00:46:04,932
All right. Oh, sweetheart.

887
00:46:05,009 --> 00:46:07,477
Oh, baby. Oh, sweetie.

888
00:46:07,511 --> 00:46:08,978
Here you are.

889
00:46:09,013 --> 00:46:10,810
Oh, thank you, Gloria.
Here you go.

890
00:46:10,848 --> 00:46:14,443
I need a cigar. Give me my--
Where are my goddamn cigars?

891
00:46:14,485 --> 00:46:16,510
Perhaps the thieves
also smoke cigars.

892
00:46:18,956 --> 00:46:21,481
It's become so common,
hasn't it?

893
00:46:21,525 --> 00:46:23,652
Who the hell are you?

894
00:46:23,694 --> 00:46:26,458
Detective Alex Tardio...

895
00:46:26,497 --> 00:46:29,489
nineteenth precinct--robbery.

896
00:46:29,533 --> 00:46:30,693
Alex.

897
00:46:31,802 --> 00:46:33,064
That's a...

898
00:46:34,905 --> 00:46:37,100
Here, pumpkin, pumpkin.

899
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:50,177
I love dogs. I have three
Bichon Frise myself.

900
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:52,382
I love Bichon Frise.

901
00:46:52,423 --> 00:46:54,323
Lovely, fluffy little--

902
00:46:56,727 --> 00:46:57,819
Come on.

903
00:46:57,862 --> 00:47:00,626
So, how can I help you?

904
00:47:00,664 --> 00:47:02,757
Help me?
I'm here to help you.

905
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,825
Why don't you take it upstairs,
boys?

906
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:06,496
Hey, listen, uh...

907
00:47:06,537 --> 00:47:08,505
You and your wife
went away together...

908
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:11,565
to your beach house
just for the one night?

909
00:47:11,642 --> 00:47:13,405
Yeah, that's right.
We're giving it up.

910
00:47:13,444 --> 00:47:15,844
Selling it. I suppose
we were saying good-bye.

911
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,905
We're sentimental.
You know how it is.

912
00:47:17,948 --> 00:47:19,916
I'm a renter.

913
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:21,747
Why are you selling the house?

914
00:47:21,785 --> 00:47:24,652
It's part of a court
settlement--technical procedure.

915
00:47:24,688 --> 00:47:27,088
-Bankruptcy?
-Technical procedure.

916
00:47:29,527 --> 00:47:31,222
So, let's see.

917
00:47:31,262 --> 00:47:33,059
When did you and your wife...

918
00:47:33,097 --> 00:47:37,033
decide to make this sentimental
journey out to your beach house?

919
00:47:37,067 --> 00:47:38,466
Last night.

920
00:47:38,502 --> 00:47:40,129
We were on our way
to a cocktail party.

921
00:47:40,204 --> 00:47:43,071
-Missy Davidson's party, right?
-Pretty thorough, huh?

922
00:47:43,107 --> 00:47:44,597
That's why I get the big bucks.

923
00:47:44,675 --> 00:47:45,937
Wasn't there something else
that happened...

924
00:47:45,976 --> 00:47:47,204
out at your beach house
recently?

925
00:47:47,244 --> 00:47:48,768
Something else?

926
00:47:50,247 --> 00:47:53,114
A robbery.
Wasn't there a robbery there?

927
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:55,744
Yeah, yeah. That's--
Yeah, it was a robbery.

928
00:47:55,786 --> 00:47:58,653
I--Well, in all this,
I completely forgot.

929
00:47:58,689 --> 00:48:00,680
Weren't you there? ln fact,
weren't you there with--

930
00:48:00,724 --> 00:48:02,749
That was perfectly innocent.

931
00:48:02,793 --> 00:48:05,057
You were there with the burglar,
and it was perfectly innocent?

932
00:48:06,664 --> 00:48:09,758
The burglar, yeah.
I was there with the burglar.

933
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,165
Just me and the burglar.

934
00:48:11,202 --> 00:48:13,466
Scandal and disease, Max.

935
00:48:16,807 --> 00:48:19,571
OK, so,
I read the police report...

936
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:21,407
and it's all very confusing.

937
00:48:21,445 --> 00:48:22,571
Confusing?

938
00:48:22,613 --> 00:48:24,205
Yes, and they're both
burglaries, aren't they?

939
00:48:24,248 --> 00:48:26,239
You think maybe
it was the same guy?

940
00:48:26,283 --> 00:48:28,979
-I didn't say that, you did.
-Then what are you saying?

941
00:48:29,019 --> 00:48:30,646
Oh, I see
all sorts of scenarios.

942
00:48:30,688 --> 00:48:32,622
That was a good place
for a picture.

943
00:48:32,656 --> 00:48:34,123
Like?

944
00:48:34,158 --> 00:48:35,785
Like there's a house
full of valuable objects...

945
00:48:35,826 --> 00:48:37,794
out at the beach that
you're not supposed to be in...

946
00:48:37,828 --> 00:48:39,728
but you are,
and a burglary occurs.

947
00:48:39,763 --> 00:48:41,788
And then you talk your wife
into leaving this house...

948
00:48:41,832 --> 00:48:44,130
for sentimental reasons...

949
00:48:44,168 --> 00:48:47,103
and when the coast is clear,
it happens again.

950
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:49,139
Are you suggesting
that I hired a thief...

951
00:48:49,206 --> 00:48:50,639
to burglarize my house...

952
00:48:50,674 --> 00:48:52,005
so I could collect
the insurance money?

953
00:48:52,042 --> 00:48:53,805
I'm not suggesting anything.
You asked for scenarios.

954
00:48:53,844 --> 00:48:55,812
You're the one
that keeps saying things.

955
00:48:55,879 --> 00:48:58,780
Watch it, Mister Detective.

956
00:48:58,816 --> 00:49:01,307
You come into my house
and accuse me of things?

957
00:49:01,352 --> 00:49:03,411
You think I need
the insurance money?

958
00:49:03,454 --> 00:49:05,217
I could buy and sell
a thousand of you.

959
00:49:07,891 --> 00:49:10,792
Here, come on, baby.

960
00:49:11,962 --> 00:49:14,294
The Yorkie
is an independent dog...

961
00:49:14,331 --> 00:49:16,424
but a devoted companion.

962
00:49:16,467 --> 00:49:19,197
And despite his small size...

963
00:49:19,236 --> 00:49:22,501
he is more than willing to act
as a guardian for his master.

964
00:49:23,907 --> 00:49:26,671
Buy and sell a thousand of me?
Really?

965
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,473
Just out of curiosity...

966
00:49:28,512 --> 00:49:30,002
how much would you get
for someone like me?

967
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,809
You know, wholesale like that.

968
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:35,646
I can't tell
if you're trying to trap me...

969
00:49:35,686 --> 00:49:37,153
or you're looking for a bribe.

970
00:49:44,295 --> 00:49:46,126
What the hell was that?

971
00:49:46,163 --> 00:49:48,427
All right, boys,
let's take a good look around.

972
00:49:50,768 --> 00:49:52,235
Dial Earl.

973
00:49:55,906 --> 00:49:57,498
Incoming!

974
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:08,711
Earl Radburn,
head of security, T.U.I.

975
00:50:08,752 --> 00:50:10,549
It's Fairbanks.
We got a situation here.

976
00:50:10,587 --> 00:50:13,078
Yes, sir, Mr. Fairbanks.
I'll be there at 1400.

977
00:50:13,123 --> 00:50:14,351
Speak English, Earl.

978
00:50:14,391 --> 00:50:16,586
It's like 2:00, 2:30
at the latest.

979
00:50:16,627 --> 00:50:18,424
All right. Move your fat ass.

980
00:50:20,364 --> 00:50:22,161
What a fruitcake.

981
00:50:28,238 --> 00:50:31,230
$2,500 for a skirt?
What, are you insane?

982
00:50:31,308 --> 00:50:33,936
That's daylight robbery.
It's like I always say, Kevin.

983
00:50:33,977 --> 00:50:36,775
Everybody's in on the game
in their own way. Am I right?

984
00:50:36,814 --> 00:50:38,782
-Sure, you're right.
-See? See? Listen to that.

985
00:50:38,816 --> 00:50:40,579
At least
we're up front about it, OK?

986
00:50:40,617 --> 00:50:42,244
These guys
invite you to Paris...

987
00:50:42,286 --> 00:50:44,777
turn out some 14-year-old models
who look like boys--

988
00:50:44,822 --> 00:50:46,084
I mean,
who am I to judge, right?

989
00:50:46,123 --> 00:50:47,590
Pretty soon you're light
a couple hundred Gs...

990
00:50:47,624 --> 00:50:50,115
flyin' back to Dallas
to your big-assed wife--

991
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,627
Hey, you leave my ass
out of this one.

992
00:50:51,662 --> 00:50:53,630
I was talking about
a hypothetical ass.

993
00:50:53,664 --> 00:50:55,564
See why I married him?
Anybody?

994
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,123
Yo, yo, yo.
I got information on your boy.

995
00:50:57,167 --> 00:50:59,601
Fairbanks has to be
in Washington on Wednesday.

996
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:01,297
He's appearing before
some Senate subcommittee.

997
00:51:01,372 --> 00:51:03,636
Something about owning
too many television stations...

998
00:51:03,707 --> 00:51:04,799
in certain key markets.

999
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:07,366
It's just a formality, because
from what I can gather...

1000
00:51:07,444 --> 00:51:08,604
he's gonna grease up
the bums on the subcommittee...

1001
00:51:08,645 --> 00:51:10,306
before he even gets there.

1002
00:51:10,347 --> 00:51:12,975
See? It's just like I said.
Everybody's in on the game.

1003
00:51:13,016 --> 00:51:15,917
Then we go to Washington.
Where's he staying?

1004
00:51:15,953 --> 00:51:18,683
Homeboy keeps a crib
across from the Watergate.

1005
00:51:18,722 --> 00:51:21,282
Hold on. I'm coming.

1006
00:51:21,325 --> 00:51:23,452
Oh, no.
No, you're not coming.

1007
00:51:23,494 --> 00:51:24,586
Ann Marie, we're going.

1008
00:51:24,628 --> 00:51:26,596
We should go to Washington.
You're absolutely right.

1009
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:29,064
Please stay out of this.
Baby stay out of it. Thank you.

1010
00:51:34,872 --> 00:51:38,501
You know what? Bottom line--

1011
00:51:38,575 --> 00:51:40,167
you're not going.

1012
00:51:42,379 --> 00:51:46,611
So nice you could get away
for a couple of days, boo.

1013
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:49,983
Very sweet of you
to insist, boo.

1014
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,454
Well, we're all here--
Fred, Ethel, Lucy, and Ricky--

1015
00:51:52,489 --> 00:51:55,617
the Mertzes and Ricardos
go to Washington.

1016
00:51:55,659 --> 00:51:57,650
Lucy, don' do that to me!

1017
00:52:17,681 --> 00:52:22,311
Stress. That's the killer.

1018
00:52:22,352 --> 00:52:25,344
You can't think straight.

1019
00:52:25,389 --> 00:52:27,823
You get all tight and confused.

1020
00:52:29,426 --> 00:52:30,586
Lower.

1021
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,891
That is as low
as I'm gonna go...

1022
00:52:38,936 --> 00:52:42,394
until you make
a commitment, Max.

1023
00:52:42,439 --> 00:52:43,531
You knew I was married...

1024
00:52:43,607 --> 00:52:46,576
when we started
this relationship, Tracey.

1025
00:52:46,643 --> 00:52:48,907
I meant a commitment
to getting me an audition...

1026
00:52:48,946 --> 00:52:50,846
with Entertainment Tonight.

1027
00:52:50,881 --> 00:52:53,008
Oh, that.

1028
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:56,816
Well, let me be perfectly clear
about that.

1029
00:52:56,854 --> 00:52:58,321
You have no talent.

1030
00:53:01,492 --> 00:53:02,982
What the hell
did you do that for?

1031
00:53:03,026 --> 00:53:05,927
-You have no respect.
-Well, why should I respect you?

1032
00:53:09,566 --> 00:53:13,502
Oh, my head's ringing. Oh, oh!
My whole head is ringing.

1033
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:15,834
Massaging you
is like kneading dough...

1034
00:53:15,906 --> 00:53:18,534
and as for the sex,
let me be honest.

1035
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:21,043
It was like sleeping
with a damp sheep.

1036
00:53:24,181 --> 00:53:25,614
Asshole.

1037
00:53:25,649 --> 00:53:27,310
She's just upset
because I'm dumping her.

1038
00:53:27,351 --> 00:53:29,717
Eleven more months
where she came from, sir.

1039
00:53:29,753 --> 00:53:32,313
Right.
What I want to know, Earl...

1040
00:53:32,356 --> 00:53:33,983
is what are you doing
about this schmeggege...

1041
00:53:34,024 --> 00:53:35,423
keeps breaking into my houses?

1042
00:53:35,459 --> 00:53:36,790
I have my people
working on it...

1043
00:53:36,827 --> 00:53:38,454
people you don't need
to know about...

1044
00:53:38,495 --> 00:53:40,224
and if they could find
a certain blue dress...

1045
00:53:40,264 --> 00:53:44,064
and they by God did, they can
find this weasel like that.

1046
00:53:44,101 --> 00:53:47,229
Max, why not just give back
the goddamn ring?

1047
00:53:47,304 --> 00:53:49,772
We've got bigger fish to fry.
It's not your ring.

1048
00:53:49,806 --> 00:53:52,604
-It's not mine?
-No, it's not your ring.

1049
00:53:52,643 --> 00:53:53,667
You stole it. Give it back.

1050
00:53:53,744 --> 00:53:56,975
This wacko breaks into my house
and tries to steal my stuff...

1051
00:53:57,014 --> 00:53:58,606
and this isn't my ring, Walter?

1052
00:53:58,649 --> 00:54:00,116
Spoils of war.

1053
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:02,983
Spoils of war.
Right. Goddamn right, Earl.

1054
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,749
Max, you've got
a lot of business...

1055
00:54:04,788 --> 00:54:06,847
in gray areas at the moment.

1056
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:08,084
You're letting a small-timer...

1057
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:09,922
distract you
from the bigger picture.

1058
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,485
Sometimes you have to give back
a little to get a lot.

1059
00:54:12,529 --> 00:54:15,965
It ain't gonna happen, Walter.
It is not gonna happen.

1060
00:54:15,999 --> 00:54:18,092
I want to go home!

1061
00:54:18,135 --> 00:54:20,000
What does this look like,
a taxi?

1062
00:54:21,104 --> 00:54:22,731
Dial Lutetia.

1063
00:54:28,312 --> 00:54:29,779
Ah! Now we're in business.

1064
00:54:29,813 --> 00:54:32,839
OK.
To hell with the monuments.

1065
00:54:32,883 --> 00:54:34,942
Here we go. Savvy shopping
in the nation's capital.

1066
00:54:34,985 --> 00:54:37,886
We're gonna go to Georgetown.
You're gonna freak out.

1067
00:54:37,921 --> 00:54:39,650
Oh, man, it's a bad angle.

1068
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,783
I can't get a clear look
at his place from here.

1069
00:54:41,825 --> 00:54:43,690
So, hey, how are you guys
gonna get past the doorman?

1070
00:54:43,727 --> 00:54:44,819
Nothin' fancy.

1071
00:54:44,861 --> 00:54:47,227
Just stroll right in
like we own the place.

1072
00:54:47,264 --> 00:54:48,959
Welcome to Potomac House.

1073
00:54:48,999 --> 00:54:50,466
Our apartments
on the east side...

1074
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,695
have magnificent views
of the capitol.

1075
00:54:52,736 --> 00:54:56,263
Our penthouse suites
are five thousand square feet...

1076
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:58,865
and have three hundred and sixty
degree vistas...

1077
00:54:58,942 --> 00:55:00,967
but, of course, there...

1078
00:55:01,044 --> 00:55:03,171
we're talking about
quite a bit of money.

1079
00:55:18,929 --> 00:55:20,658
Salaam. Salaam. Kuwait.

1080
00:55:20,697 --> 00:55:24,428
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I most humbly apologize.

1081
00:55:24,468 --> 00:55:26,095
However, there seems
to be a confusion...

1082
00:55:26,136 --> 00:55:27,501
because the prince
would like to know...

1083
00:55:27,571 --> 00:55:29,232
how much
for the entire building.

1084
00:55:29,306 --> 00:55:31,365
Wait. Let me see is correct.

1085
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:33,568
-Hassim yassi.
-Correct.

1086
00:55:33,644 --> 00:55:36,238
I'm not sure that's possible.

1087
00:55:58,902 --> 00:56:02,702
Get up! Oh, maladar! Ah-kleck!

1088
00:56:02,773 --> 00:56:05,333
Salaam, salaam, salaam.
He say, "For right amount...

1089
00:56:05,409 --> 00:56:07,775
camel can dance up pyramid."

1090
00:56:09,012 --> 00:56:11,446
It loses something
in translation.

1091
00:56:11,481 --> 00:56:14,041
Why don't you take the elevator
up to the penthouse suite...

1092
00:56:14,084 --> 00:56:15,381
and I'll gather
some of my people together...

1093
00:56:15,419 --> 00:56:16,784
and meet you up there.

1094
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,913
Make yourselves at home.

1095
00:56:18,955 --> 00:56:21,082
It may be your home.

1096
00:56:22,859 --> 00:56:23,985
Home.

1097
00:56:24,027 --> 00:56:27,793
Go.
Give her big bug, beef jerky?

1098
00:56:29,299 --> 00:56:32,962
Mine, all mine.

1099
00:56:33,003 --> 00:56:34,493
He say
he would like to hump you...

1100
00:56:34,538 --> 00:56:36,005
but we are
on a very tight schedule.

1101
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:37,165
Salaam aleichem.

1102
00:56:38,308 --> 00:56:40,139
Come on, Berger.

1103
00:56:50,053 --> 00:56:51,850
Is anybody home?

1104
00:56:58,929 --> 00:57:00,191
What are you looking at?

1105
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:03,256
Nothing. You just look great
in a tablecloth, man.

1106
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,426
Not a lot of people
could pull it off.

1107
00:57:04,468 --> 00:57:05,867
I mean, look at Arafat.
I mean, look at me.

1108
00:57:05,936 --> 00:57:07,563
I look like
I should be driving a cab.

1109
00:57:09,206 --> 00:57:12,039
Damn.
So this is Max's D.C. pad, huh?

1110
00:57:12,075 --> 00:57:13,906
Mebala.

1111
00:57:15,011 --> 00:57:18,708
Maxie? Maxie waxie?

1112
00:57:18,749 --> 00:57:20,580
Your friends are here.

1113
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,979
-Watch your step, sir.
-Whoa! I'm all right.

1114
00:57:28,492 --> 00:57:30,653
We'll meet back at my place
to prep for the hearing.

1115
00:57:30,694 --> 00:57:32,423
All right, Max.

1116
00:57:32,462 --> 00:57:36,796
Earl, you call me the minute
you hear anything, you got it?

1117
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:38,164
On it.

1118
00:57:41,371 --> 00:57:43,032
Wonder where lard-ass is.

1119
00:57:44,174 --> 00:57:46,472
Hello? Are you there?

1120
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:48,100
Max, it's Gloria.

1121
00:57:48,178 --> 00:57:49,975
Pick up, Max.

1122
00:57:51,114 --> 00:57:52,479
We're in the clear.
It's the phone.

1123
00:57:52,516 --> 00:57:53,813
Are you there?

1124
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:57,445
Well, I just wanted to let you
know the money is in your desk.

1125
00:57:57,487 --> 00:58:00,615
I mean, the contributions
for the senators.

1126
00:58:00,657 --> 00:58:03,626
You may want to call me
for a reading with the cards.

1127
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:04,820
It's a PAC,
just like Shelly said.

1128
00:58:04,861 --> 00:58:07,523
You still need me for the cards,
don't you, baby?

1129
00:58:07,564 --> 00:58:09,361
So sad.

1130
00:58:14,571 --> 00:58:16,539
The marrying maiden.

1131
00:58:16,573 --> 00:58:19,269
What the hell's
that got to do with me?

1132
00:58:19,342 --> 00:58:21,310
The ring.

1133
00:58:21,378 --> 00:58:23,608
The thief.

1134
00:58:25,415 --> 00:58:28,009
The castle.

1135
00:58:28,051 --> 00:58:31,077
The thief is in the castle.
Dial Earl.

1136
00:58:32,722 --> 00:58:34,087
Got it. Here they are.

1137
00:58:34,124 --> 00:58:35,716
Look at that.

1138
00:58:37,761 --> 00:58:40,195
See, you can't outright
just bribe these senators.

1139
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:42,255
You gotta give the money
to these PACs.

1140
00:58:42,299 --> 00:58:44,164
PACs. I don't know.
It stands for something.

1141
00:58:44,201 --> 00:58:46,533
Why don't you just save it
for the senators?

1142
00:58:49,539 --> 00:58:51,973
-Wait. Wait, wait.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

1143
00:58:52,042 --> 00:58:55,273
Earl, he's in my place.
He's at my apartment.

1144
00:58:55,345 --> 00:58:56,710
Get the cops
and meet me over there.

1145
00:58:56,746 --> 00:58:58,714
I'm going up the back way.

1146
00:59:04,621 --> 00:59:06,179
Welcome back, Mr. Fairbanks.

1147
00:59:06,223 --> 00:59:11,525
"...this, and eat shit.
Love, Max."

1148
00:59:13,163 --> 00:59:17,395
A hundred and fifteen thousand
dollars cash.

1149
00:59:17,434 --> 00:59:20,961
-The greatest crime.
-Maybe we should go, huh?

1150
00:59:21,004 --> 00:59:22,369
What, and leave the ring?

1151
00:59:24,774 --> 00:59:27,334
-Welcome back, Mr. Radburn.
-Not now.

1152
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:29,071
-Come on, let's go. Come on.
-Stop worrying, OK?

1153
00:59:29,145 --> 00:59:30,237
I gotta get this ring.

1154
00:59:30,313 --> 00:59:33,146
That's easy for you to say.
You don't have a prison record.

1155
00:59:33,183 --> 00:59:35,344
I got some good undershirts,
didn't l?

1156
00:59:36,486 --> 00:59:37,646
Oh, my God. Kevin.

1157
00:59:40,557 --> 00:59:41,990
I told you,
let's get out of here.

1158
00:59:42,025 --> 00:59:43,185
What?

1159
00:59:44,494 --> 00:59:46,655
-I knew this was gonna happen.
-Berger's got his pager.

1160
00:59:50,834 --> 00:59:52,233
God, I'm hard.

1161
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:59,675
Earl Radburn,
head of security, T.U.I.

1162
01:00:10,654 --> 01:00:12,315
Come on, let's go out the back.

1163
01:00:26,102 --> 01:00:27,592
It's me, you idiot.

1164
01:00:27,637 --> 01:00:29,969
Sorry,
but they went out the back!

1165
01:00:30,006 --> 01:00:32,873
I came up the back. Moron.

1166
01:00:37,814 --> 01:00:40,282
Oh, my goodness.
Well, you have to hold it in.

1167
01:01:01,705 --> 01:01:05,004
-Let's get the hell out of here!
-Going out the back, huh?

1168
01:01:05,075 --> 01:01:06,702
I'm gonna call the cell phone.

1169
01:01:06,776 --> 01:01:09,006
Come on. We got the money.
Let's go, let's go.

1170
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:11,206
You really need help, man,
I'm telling you.

1171
01:01:11,281 --> 01:01:13,545
Aah! Oh, you got me!

1172
01:01:19,356 --> 01:01:22,587
-Berger, what's going on?
-Take a good look at me, huh?

1173
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:24,855
It's kind of hard to describe.
Look, I gotta go.

1174
01:01:24,894 --> 01:01:26,521
Talk to me!

1175
01:01:30,233 --> 01:01:33,031
Yeah, look at you,
falling all over yourself. Ah!

1176
01:01:33,069 --> 01:01:34,934
You brought it--Aah!

1177
01:01:34,971 --> 01:01:37,496
Look at you! Oh!

1178
01:01:49,686 --> 01:01:52,280
The wrong damn ring?

1179
01:01:52,322 --> 01:01:57,385
Amber,
I got the wrong finger, OK?

1180
01:01:57,427 --> 01:02:00,123
His damn wedding ring.

1181
01:02:00,163 --> 01:02:02,597
Baby, say something.

1182
01:02:02,632 --> 01:02:05,760
You ain't said a word to me
since we left Washington.

1183
01:02:05,802 --> 01:02:07,167
Can I get some convo?

1184
01:02:08,538 --> 01:02:13,373
OK. I have never been so scared
in my whole life.

1185
01:02:13,443 --> 01:02:16,105
All right, now, calm down, OK?

1186
01:02:16,179 --> 01:02:18,704
I know it was sort of unusual.

1187
01:02:18,782 --> 01:02:20,807
Unusual?
Oh, come on, Kevin.

1188
01:02:20,884 --> 01:02:22,112
There were guns.
There were cops.

1189
01:02:22,152 --> 01:02:25,485
Well, it's really not that bad
when you're in the middle of it.

1190
01:02:25,522 --> 01:02:28,047
You know, your adrenaline
gets to pumping so hard...

1191
01:02:28,091 --> 01:02:29,388
you really don't think about--

1192
01:02:29,426 --> 01:02:34,728
-The consequences?
-Yeah, yeah, the consequences.

1193
01:02:34,764 --> 01:02:36,527
Kevin, this has got to stop.

1194
01:02:36,566 --> 01:02:39,057
You don't need to prove
that you love me.

1195
01:02:39,102 --> 01:02:40,535
I know you do...

1196
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:44,131
and I don't care about that
stupid ring, do you hear me?

1197
01:02:44,207 --> 01:02:45,697
I just want you.

1198
01:02:45,775 --> 01:02:49,302
Well, then, don't worry.
You got me.

1199
01:02:50,513 --> 01:02:52,140
So you'll forget
about the ring, then?

1200
01:03:02,492 --> 01:03:04,824
Amber,
I'll forget about the ring.

1201
01:03:04,861 --> 01:03:07,728
It's forgotten.

1202
01:03:07,764 --> 01:03:09,493
Excuse me!

1203
01:03:09,532 --> 01:03:11,261
Hey, what's up, girls?
How you doin'?

1204
01:03:11,301 --> 01:03:12,461
Sorry.

1205
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:16,065
Yo, Jack. It's after 7:00.

1206
01:03:16,106 --> 01:03:17,596
You seen your nephew
by the name of Kevin?

1207
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,801
No. What your rappin' ass
want with him?

1208
01:03:19,876 --> 01:03:21,366
Later, man.

1209
01:03:22,745 --> 01:03:23,939
Son of a bitch crazy.

1210
01:03:28,551 --> 01:03:30,849
-That's twice you ran out on me.
-I know, but I'm sor--

1211
01:03:30,887 --> 01:03:33,481
Oh, it was funny how you never
cramp up when you gotta run.

1212
01:03:33,523 --> 01:03:35,923
Kevin, I got low potassium, man.
When I don't eat my bananas...

1213
01:03:35,959 --> 01:03:37,586
I cramp up, dog. You know that.
Come on, man.

1214
01:03:37,627 --> 01:03:39,891
Wait. What are you gonna do
with that doughnut?

1215
01:03:39,929 --> 01:03:42,830
Oh, you want this?
Run get that.

1216
01:03:42,866 --> 01:03:45,334
Yo, Kev,
thanks for the breakfast, man.

1217
01:03:45,368 --> 01:03:47,427
-Here. You got that?
-No doubt.

1218
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:49,165
Hey, come on. Let's see it.
Let's see it, man.

1219
01:03:49,205 --> 01:03:51,901
All right, cool.
Bam ! Done!

1220
01:03:51,975 --> 01:03:53,909
See? I came through, man.
If it wasn't for me...

1221
01:03:53,943 --> 01:03:55,467
That's what so great
about this country.

1222
01:03:55,545 --> 01:03:57,843
We're hand in hand,
synergistically...

1223
01:03:57,881 --> 01:03:59,007
going forward into the future.

1224
01:03:59,082 --> 01:04:01,516
That's the way it is.
It's give and take...

1225
01:04:01,551 --> 01:04:03,678
and that's the way we feel
at T.U.I.

1226
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,188
You make a compelling point,
Mr. Fairbanks. Please continue.

1227
01:04:06,222 --> 01:04:08,986
Thank you, senator.
As I was saying...

1228
01:04:09,025 --> 01:04:10,293
restrictive monopoly laws...

1229
01:04:10,293 --> 01:04:13,160
are choking communications
companies like mine.

1230
01:04:13,196 --> 01:04:16,029
If T.U.I. can dominate a market,
why hold us back?

1231
01:04:16,065 --> 01:04:18,363
T.U.I. provides employment...

1232
01:04:18,401 --> 01:04:20,995
which in turn provides
tax revenues...

1233
01:04:21,037 --> 01:04:23,699
in large markets
and in small alike.

1234
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:26,504
I contend that the laws
that limit ownership...

1235
01:04:26,576 --> 01:04:30,410
of television stations by
telecommunications companies...

1236
01:04:30,446 --> 01:04:33,074
are punitive and wrong.

1237
01:04:36,152 --> 01:04:38,120
What's with Mount Rushmore
up there?

1238
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:43,588
Guess who, shit box.

1239
01:04:43,626 --> 01:04:46,220
Ooh, it's the little thief.

1240
01:04:46,262 --> 01:04:47,524
I beg your pardon?

1241
01:04:47,564 --> 01:04:48,861
No, I'm not talking to you.

1242
01:04:48,898 --> 01:04:52,197
Oh, man, I made, what,
two hundred grand robbing you?

1243
01:04:52,235 --> 01:04:53,634
I wouldn't call that
"Iittle" anything.

1244
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:55,001
State of mind.

1245
01:04:55,038 --> 01:04:56,903
What are you yammering about,
Mr. Fairbanks?

1246
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:58,237
I'm not talking to you.
Excuse me.

1247
01:04:58,308 --> 01:05:00,538
Well, let me tell you
what state of mind I'm in.

1248
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:02,168
My lady's getting sick and tired
of this whole thing...

1249
01:05:02,245 --> 01:05:04,406
so I thought it would be easier
for the both of us...

1250
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,380
if you just
give me back my ring...

1251
01:05:06,416 --> 01:05:07,747
and I give you back yours.

1252
01:05:07,784 --> 01:05:09,012
Now, nod your head...

1253
01:05:09,052 --> 01:05:11,179
'cause I'm watching
your little ass on TV.

1254
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:16,589
TV? Which camera? This camera?

1255
01:05:16,626 --> 01:05:18,719
Exactly. That one right there.

1256
01:05:18,761 --> 01:05:19,887
Hold your head up...

1257
01:05:19,929 --> 01:05:22,056
'cause you got that
double chin thing happening.

1258
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:25,600
Damn, that's cold.

1259
01:05:25,635 --> 01:05:27,364
Take a good look,
you [Bleep] asshole.

1260
01:05:27,403 --> 01:05:29,735
Does this look like the face
of a man who got where he is...

1261
01:05:29,772 --> 01:05:32,206
by giving [bleep] away?
[Bleep] you.

1262
01:05:33,776 --> 01:05:35,141
Mr. Fairbanks.

1263
01:05:35,178 --> 01:05:38,011
Cussing on TV. He cussing on TV.
He dying.

1264
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:40,675
I think he's angry.
I think he's perturbed.

1265
01:05:40,717 --> 01:05:42,412
-Mr. Fairbanks--
-Walter--

1266
01:05:42,452 --> 01:05:44,613
-Hang up the phone!
-Mr. Fairbanks!

1267
01:05:44,654 --> 01:05:45,780
Just a minute.

1268
01:05:45,822 --> 01:05:47,915
It looks like the face of a man
who don't have a damn clue.

1269
01:05:47,957 --> 01:05:50,016
-I took your PAC money.
-Oh, yeah?

1270
01:05:50,059 --> 01:05:51,788
That's why all those little
fat white asses...

1271
01:05:51,828 --> 01:05:52,988
ain't rolling over for you.

1272
01:05:53,029 --> 01:05:55,122
Mr. Fairbanks,
a little respect, please.

1273
01:05:55,164 --> 01:05:58,827
-Just a minute.
-Now, you give me my ring...

1274
01:05:58,868 --> 01:06:00,893
-and I'll leave you alone.
-I'm addressing you.

1275
01:06:00,937 --> 01:06:02,199
Well, you know what you can do,
scumbucket?

1276
01:06:02,238 --> 01:06:05,730
-You can [bleep] my [bleep].
-Mr. Fairbanks!

1277
01:06:05,808 --> 01:06:07,605
Now, that's what
I'm talking about.

1278
01:06:07,677 --> 01:06:09,110
C-SPAN's gotten better.

1279
01:06:09,979 --> 01:06:11,344
All right, that's it.

1280
01:06:11,381 --> 01:06:13,315
The ring's
coming off your finger...

1281
01:06:13,349 --> 01:06:14,714
if I got to cut it off.

1282
01:06:14,751 --> 01:06:18,016
Oh, yeah? [Bleep] you
and [bleep] your girlfriend.

1283
01:06:18,054 --> 01:06:19,385
My girlfriend?

1284
01:06:20,490 --> 01:06:22,014
This is a senate subcommittee,
Mr. Fairbanks.

1285
01:06:22,058 --> 01:06:25,027
[Bleep] you, [bleep] you,
[bleep] you.

1286
01:06:32,735 --> 01:06:33,861
I love democracy.

1287
01:06:33,903 --> 01:06:36,973
That's what I call
entertainment.

1288
01:06:41,844 --> 01:06:43,311
I told you this no-good gonif...

1289
01:06:43,346 --> 01:06:44,643
was gonna make
a fool out of you.

1290
01:06:44,681 --> 01:06:47,946
Look what you've done
over a stupid goddamn ring.

1291
01:06:47,984 --> 01:06:50,384
I could've fixed the PAC thing.
You blew a whole market.

1292
01:06:50,453 --> 01:06:52,751
You blew millions.
I hope you're satisfied.

1293
01:06:52,789 --> 01:06:55,314
Walter, why don't you
go see a doctor...

1294
01:06:55,391 --> 01:06:57,325
and ask him if he can find
some ghostly outline...

1295
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,554
where your balls used to be...

1296
01:06:58,594 --> 01:07:02,121
and then plead with him
to stitch another pair back on?

1297
01:07:06,436 --> 01:07:07,596
Stop the car, please.

1298
01:07:10,073 --> 01:07:11,506
What?

1299
01:07:13,276 --> 01:07:15,574
Max, I have been your lawyer
for twenty years.

1300
01:07:15,611 --> 01:07:17,636
I have taken
your degrading insults...

1301
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:18,840
and your petty mockeries.

1302
01:07:18,881 --> 01:07:20,906
I have stood by you...

1303
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:23,043
while you've bent the law and
while you've broken the law...

1304
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:24,211
because there's
something fascinating...

1305
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:25,618
in seeing how low you can go...

1306
01:07:25,688 --> 01:07:28,248
and I felt a genuine kind
of pity for someone so driven.

1307
01:07:28,324 --> 01:07:29,552
But if you're gonna continue...

1308
01:07:29,592 --> 01:07:32,186
to play
this idiotic schoolyard game...

1309
01:07:32,228 --> 01:07:35,391
over a cheap and ugly,
by the way, ring...

1310
01:07:35,431 --> 01:07:38,662
this is the end of the line.
I am getting off the bus.

1311
01:07:38,701 --> 01:07:40,328
Limo.

1312
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:47,176
Screw you, Max,
and the limo you rode in on.

1313
01:07:49,545 --> 01:07:50,978
Where are you going?

1314
01:07:52,415 --> 01:07:54,906
Come on. Get back in the car.

1315
01:07:54,951 --> 01:07:56,942
Go with him. Go with him.
Walter.

1316
01:07:57,019 --> 01:07:58,145
Come on.

1317
01:08:00,323 --> 01:08:03,554
You can't walk all the way home.
What are you going to do?

1318
01:08:04,761 --> 01:08:07,423
Guess I went a little
too far this time, Earl.

1319
01:08:07,463 --> 01:08:08,623
Yes, sir.

1320
01:08:08,664 --> 01:08:10,962
-You've been hacked.
-What?

1321
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,228
One of my people found out...

1322
01:08:12,268 --> 01:08:15,396
our "friend" has been able
to track your whereabouts...

1323
01:08:15,438 --> 01:08:17,429
by intercepting your e-mails.

1324
01:08:17,473 --> 01:08:20,772
Why, that little son of a--

1325
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:24,769
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
This could be good, Earl.

1326
01:08:24,814 --> 01:08:27,544
Yeah, because now we can
control the situation.

1327
01:08:27,583 --> 01:08:30,245
We can let him know exactly
what we want him to know.

1328
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,685
Bring him right to us.

1329
01:08:32,722 --> 01:08:34,713
You're one crafty bastard, Earl.

1330
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:36,520
Thank you, sir.

1331
01:08:36,559 --> 01:08:38,493
If the boys at the Pentagon
had had your faith in me...

1332
01:08:38,561 --> 01:08:40,552
there'd be a Disney World
in Cuba right now.

1333
01:08:45,134 --> 01:08:47,125
All right. Go on.

1334
01:09:00,983 --> 01:09:03,042
The driver gave us a pretty good
description of the robbers.

1335
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:06,350
Too good. I've done some costume
design in community theater...

1336
01:09:06,422 --> 01:09:08,583
so I've seen my share
of bad acting.

1337
01:09:08,658 --> 01:09:09,989
Assign one of our people...

1338
01:09:10,026 --> 01:09:11,653
to shadow
the driver and his assistant.

1339
01:09:11,694 --> 01:09:14,185
It's too tempting when one is
around that much cash every day.

1340
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:15,629
You got it, detective.

1341
01:09:15,665 --> 01:09:17,030
Oh, there he is. Hey, Tardio.

1342
01:09:17,066 --> 01:09:19,830
Got all these files you asked
for concerning Fairbanks.

1343
01:09:19,869 --> 01:09:21,837
-Thank you, Jerry.
-No problem.

1344
01:09:21,871 --> 01:09:24,567
Didn't I see you at the lce
Capades show last Monday?

1345
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:28,202
Come on, Tardio.
I don't do lce Capades.

1346
01:09:30,413 --> 01:09:32,176
The shoes say butch,
but the socks say...

1347
01:09:32,215 --> 01:09:33,705
"Hi, how you doin'?"

1348
01:09:42,492 --> 01:09:44,460
-Hey, Jack.
-Hey, baby.

1349
01:09:44,527 --> 01:09:46,995
-Where's Amber?
-She asked for the day off.

1350
01:09:47,029 --> 01:09:48,553
I knew she was upset.

1351
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:51,891
Amber got a pretty good
head on her shoulders.

1352
01:09:51,934 --> 01:09:54,164
Maybe you need to listen
to what she has to say.

1353
01:09:55,771 --> 01:09:57,671
You don't even like Amber.

1354
01:09:57,707 --> 01:09:59,732
Amber and I happen to agree
on this one...

1355
01:09:59,775 --> 01:10:02,039
so therefore I say she OK.

1356
01:10:02,078 --> 01:10:04,012
-But?
-But?

1357
01:10:04,046 --> 01:10:06,708
But you making this thing
personal with this Fairbanks...

1358
01:10:06,749 --> 01:10:08,444
and that's bad for business.

1359
01:10:08,484 --> 01:10:11,317
And that's the first thing
I taught you about this game.

1360
01:10:11,387 --> 01:10:13,355
Kevin, I got two words for you.

1361
01:10:13,422 --> 01:10:15,390
-Bankruptcy auction.
-What?

1362
01:10:15,424 --> 01:10:16,721
I just got off the phone
with Shelly.

1363
01:10:16,759 --> 01:10:18,920
-He hacked into their e-mail.
-Talk to me.

1364
01:10:18,961 --> 01:10:20,485
Fairbanks is gonna be
at his beach house...

1365
01:10:20,530 --> 01:10:22,225
for a bankruptcy auction
the day after tomorrow...

1366
01:10:22,265 --> 01:10:24,597
and after, he's gonna be out of
the country for a couple months.

1367
01:10:24,634 --> 01:10:27,262
Leave it alone, son.
This is your old uncle Jack.

1368
01:10:27,303 --> 01:10:28,600
If you only listen to me
one time...

1369
01:10:28,638 --> 01:10:31,004
for the rest of your life,
listen to me now.

1370
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,167
Take it from a man
who raised you from a pup.

1371
01:10:33,209 --> 01:10:36,906
Let it go. I seen other guys
go down the road you're going...

1372
01:10:36,946 --> 01:10:39,346
and you know
what they call that? Dead end.

1373
01:10:39,382 --> 01:10:42,374
Let it go, Kevin.
Goddamn, Kevin, let it go.

1374
01:10:42,418 --> 01:10:45,148
Seven million dollars worth
of art, jewelry, and antiques.

1375
01:10:45,221 --> 01:10:48,213
I'll drive. Hand me my keys over
there, right underneath there.

1376
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:51,954
Come on, Lutetia.
Don't worry about it.

1377
01:10:51,994 --> 01:10:54,792
Nobody even watches
these hearings. Excuse me.

1378
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:57,458
You've gone too far, Max.
Swearing on TV?

1379
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,660
You make a fool
out of yourself...

1380
01:10:58,701 --> 01:11:00,532
publicly humiliate
the both of us...

1381
01:11:00,570 --> 01:11:03,095
and put your entire company
at risk, for what?

1382
01:11:03,139 --> 01:11:05,004
Some trinket
out of a crackerjack box?

1383
01:11:05,041 --> 01:11:07,236
Look, when I catch
this little putz--

1384
01:11:07,276 --> 01:11:08,402
Don't come home, Max.

1385
01:11:08,444 --> 01:11:10,674
-What?
-You're a jerk. Grow up.

1386
01:11:16,018 --> 01:11:17,815
Where's my lover? All right.

1387
01:11:20,823 --> 01:11:22,586
Berger was looking for you.

1388
01:11:22,625 --> 01:11:24,320
He found me.

1389
01:11:25,795 --> 01:11:27,763
How you doin'?

1390
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:32,567
You're going, aren't you?

1391
01:11:32,602 --> 01:11:35,435
Look, Amber,
you gave me something.

1392
01:11:35,471 --> 01:11:37,496
I lost it.
I can't have that between us.

1393
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:39,440
Well, I would much rather
have that between us...

1394
01:11:39,475 --> 01:11:41,773
than two inches of glass
at some state prison.

1395
01:11:41,811 --> 01:11:45,338
I'm sorry, you know?
A man in my position--

1396
01:11:45,381 --> 01:11:47,474
You know, you have always
said this is about me.

1397
01:11:47,516 --> 01:11:49,347
This has never been
anything more...

1398
01:11:49,418 --> 01:11:52,080
than a juvenile
dick-measuring contest.

1399
01:11:52,154 --> 01:11:54,952
Wait a minute. If this was
a dick-measuring contest...

1400
01:11:54,991 --> 01:11:56,117
I'd be declared the winner.

1401
01:11:57,259 --> 01:11:58,590
Baby elephant trunk.

1402
01:12:00,963 --> 01:12:02,430
Baby, I'm just playing.

1403
01:12:02,465 --> 01:12:03,591
You know
I'm just messing with you.

1404
01:12:03,633 --> 01:12:05,897
Kevin, grow up.

1405
01:12:10,006 --> 01:12:12,998
He's making me nuts. I don't
know what to do with him.

1406
01:12:13,042 --> 01:12:16,500
-So, what's the pre-nup like?
-There isn't one.

1407
01:12:16,545 --> 01:12:18,137
Then divorce him.
Cream the bastard.

1408
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:21,206
Oh, I don't know. I don't know
what this says about me...

1409
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:24,981
but I'm kind of fond
of the old dog.

1410
01:12:25,054 --> 01:12:26,544
I mean, s--

1411
01:12:26,622 --> 01:12:29,113
-Is Jack inside?
-I think so.

1412
01:12:46,876 --> 01:12:48,810
Man trouble?

1413
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:53,974
It's always man trouble.

1414
01:12:54,016 --> 01:12:55,745
Well, now you got
woman trouble, too.

1415
01:12:55,818 --> 01:12:59,413
That's my jacket.
What are you doing with it?

1416
01:12:59,488 --> 01:13:02,048
-You're the thief's wife.
-The thief?

1417
01:13:02,124 --> 01:13:04,319
-Your husband stole my ring.
-What?

1418
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:07,090
That was my ring,
and I gave it to my boyfriend.

1419
01:13:07,129 --> 01:13:11,156
You want your jacket?
Have your jacket.

1420
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:16,639
Wait a minute.

1421
01:13:26,215 --> 01:13:28,149
Pull daddy like a chariot.

1422
01:13:29,885 --> 01:13:34,151
Look, kids.
Oh, what a beautiful child!

1423
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:36,681
-Thanks.
-Boy? Girl? Doesn't matter.

1424
01:13:36,726 --> 01:13:39,991
Lovely child. So innocent.

1425
01:13:40,029 --> 01:13:41,758
Damn. Where's that lens?

1426
01:13:49,238 --> 01:13:51,638
-What a nice surprise.
-Yes, it is, isn't it?

1427
01:13:51,674 --> 01:13:53,335
Hey, you feel like
taking a walk?

1428
01:13:53,375 --> 01:13:56,208
Sounds good,
but I got to go see an optician.

1429
01:13:56,245 --> 01:13:58,736
Yeah. You know, right now
my eye is acting up.

1430
01:13:58,814 --> 01:14:00,679
You're a little blurry
right now.

1431
01:14:00,716 --> 01:14:03,344
Really? ls that blurry?

1432
01:14:03,419 --> 01:14:05,216
Uh, no. I see that just fine.

1433
01:14:05,254 --> 01:14:07,188
That's good. Relax, would you?

1434
01:14:07,223 --> 01:14:10,021
This is just an overlap
of two connected worlds.

1435
01:14:10,059 --> 01:14:13,358
You never cross your line,
I never cross mine.

1436
01:14:13,395 --> 01:14:15,829
Know what I mean, Kevin?

1437
01:14:17,299 --> 01:14:20,894
-Damn!
-Just gas. Poor little thing.

1438
01:14:20,936 --> 01:14:23,700
Even in the outdoors, huh?

1439
01:14:23,739 --> 01:14:25,730
So what's new, Kevin?

1440
01:14:25,775 --> 01:14:28,266
Uh, nothing.
Just playing at golf.

1441
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:31,177
Doing that Tiger Woods thing.

1442
01:14:31,247 --> 01:14:32,407
You?

1443
01:14:32,481 --> 01:14:35,279
Oh, busy. There's still
a lot of crime out there.

1444
01:14:35,317 --> 01:14:36,409
Well, I'm sorry
to hear about that.

1445
01:14:36,485 --> 01:14:38,112
Especially
after all your efforts.

1446
01:14:38,154 --> 01:14:39,815
It can be time-consuming.

1447
01:14:39,855 --> 01:14:41,755
I guess that's why I never
took up a sport like you.

1448
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,917
Although for some reason...

1449
01:14:42,958 --> 01:14:44,949
I've always been drawn
to figure skating.

1450
01:14:46,495 --> 01:14:48,929
Speaking of crime, do you know
what crime I hate the most?

1451
01:14:48,964 --> 01:14:51,694
-Insurance fraud.
-Oh, yeah? Why's that?

1452
01:14:51,734 --> 01:14:54,032
Because the crook is using me.

1453
01:14:54,069 --> 01:14:55,627
"Oh, detective,
they took everything...

1454
01:14:55,671 --> 01:14:57,263
"and here's the list
of the stolen items...

1455
01:14:57,306 --> 01:14:58,432
"and can I have
that docket number...

1456
01:14:58,474 --> 01:15:00,840
"so I can claim
my insurance money?"

1457
01:15:00,876 --> 01:15:03,276
Nothing makes me angrier
than trying to solve a case...

1458
01:15:03,345 --> 01:15:05,142
that never happened.

1459
01:15:05,214 --> 01:15:09,310
So you think you got a burglary
that doesn't smell right?

1460
01:15:09,385 --> 01:15:11,910
Big townhouse. Beacon Hill.

1461
01:15:11,987 --> 01:15:14,922
I'm wondering if the arrogant
son of a bitch bankrupt bum...

1462
01:15:14,957 --> 01:15:18,916
who owns the place
maybe didn't set it up himself.

1463
01:15:18,961 --> 01:15:20,622
Yeah, well...

1464
01:15:20,663 --> 01:15:23,325
I didn't--I didn't hear nothing
about no scam...

1465
01:15:23,365 --> 01:15:26,630
but if I do, I'll let you know.

1466
01:15:26,669 --> 01:15:29,536
Do you still blink when you're
not telling the truth, Kevin?

1467
01:15:31,373 --> 01:15:34,137
Must be the contact lenses.
Walkies.

1468
01:15:34,176 --> 01:15:36,474
Come on, Pix.
We gotta get you a bran muffin.

1469
01:15:36,545 --> 01:15:39,742
We're getting everybody
bran muffins. Good, good.

1470
01:15:39,815 --> 01:15:41,339
Be cool.

1471
01:15:41,417 --> 01:15:42,714
Mr. Man.

1472
01:16:18,454 --> 01:16:20,354
Gloria, what the hell
are you doing here?

1473
01:16:20,389 --> 01:16:22,880
I drove out here because there's
something I need to tell you.

1474
01:16:22,925 --> 01:16:26,053
Here, pick one.

1475
01:16:26,095 --> 01:16:27,824
Any one.

1476
01:16:32,334 --> 01:16:35,132
-Yep. There it is again.
-What does it mean?

1477
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:36,728
The guy's got five daggers
in his head.

1478
01:16:36,772 --> 01:16:38,000
What do you think it means?

1479
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,632
How bad is it?

1480
01:16:39,675 --> 01:16:41,575
I guess a guy with six daggers
in his head would be worse...

1481
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:42,838
but they don't make that card.

1482
01:16:44,246 --> 01:16:46,237
It just keeps coming up.

1483
01:16:46,315 --> 01:16:47,839
Why the hell didn't you tell me?

1484
01:16:47,917 --> 01:16:51,683
Would you have listened to me?
Do you ever listen to anybody?

1485
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:55,679
Max, put a stop to all of this.
No good is gonna come of it.

1486
01:16:55,724 --> 01:16:57,282
-I can't.
-Why?

1487
01:16:57,326 --> 01:17:00,557
I can't, I can't, I can't!

1488
01:17:00,596 --> 01:17:03,030
Once a man in my position
gives in...

1489
01:17:03,065 --> 01:17:04,498
Iets his defenses down...

1490
01:17:04,533 --> 01:17:07,593
is weak for one single moment,
he's dead.

1491
01:17:07,636 --> 01:17:08,830
Dead, you understand?

1492
01:17:08,871 --> 01:17:11,567
That's the way it is
with animals in the jungle...

1493
01:17:11,607 --> 01:17:12,767
that's the way it is with me.

1494
01:17:12,808 --> 01:17:15,072
Oh, cut the crap, Max.
It's only a ring.

1495
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:16,907
A silly, stupid ring!

1496
01:17:16,946 --> 01:17:19,642
Yeah, and a bone
is just a bone...

1497
01:17:19,715 --> 01:17:21,512
until two lions decide...

1498
01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:23,745
that only one of them
is gonna walk away with it.

1499
01:17:23,786 --> 01:17:27,222
You know what your problem is?
You always have to win.

1500
01:17:27,256 --> 01:17:28,746
You figure out
what it is you want...

1501
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:30,315
and then you'll do anything
to get it...

1502
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:32,554
and when you get it,
you toss it aside...

1503
01:17:32,594 --> 01:17:34,027
and move on to the next thing.

1504
01:17:34,063 --> 01:17:35,394
I loved you, Max.

1505
01:17:35,431 --> 01:17:37,126
I knew who you were,
and I still loved you.

1506
01:17:37,166 --> 01:17:39,293
Who else can say that?

1507
01:17:39,335 --> 01:17:42,395
You know who you are, and you
can barely tolerate yourself.

1508
01:17:42,438 --> 01:17:45,032
Nobody talks to me that way.
Nobody.

1509
01:17:45,074 --> 01:17:47,542
-I do!
-That turns me on.

1510
01:17:54,850 --> 01:17:57,318
No! Get off me!

1511
01:17:57,386 --> 01:17:59,149
Ow! What?

1512
01:17:59,188 --> 01:18:01,782
You're doing it again,
you horny little bastard.

1513
01:18:01,824 --> 01:18:03,815
Give me a hand.
You hurt my back.

1514
01:18:03,859 --> 01:18:06,225
No. I quit, Max. Good-bye.

1515
01:18:06,261 --> 01:18:07,751
Come on. Glor--

1516
01:18:07,796 --> 01:18:09,423
You quit? You're fired!

1517
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,161
There goes
your medical and your dental!

1518
01:18:13,202 --> 01:18:16,171
You know what? I don't need it.

1519
01:18:16,205 --> 01:18:17,502
And I don't need you.

1520
01:18:19,942 --> 01:18:21,136
All right.

1521
01:18:21,176 --> 01:18:22,803
-Hello, hello.
-Buzz off.

1522
01:18:22,845 --> 01:18:24,005
I was--

1523
01:18:26,081 --> 01:18:27,639
Compound secure, chief.

1524
01:18:27,716 --> 01:18:29,547
Come here.

1525
01:18:33,155 --> 01:18:34,622
I am so flattered, sir.

1526
01:18:34,656 --> 01:18:36,851
I've thought about this, too.
More than once.

1527
01:18:36,892 --> 01:18:40,191
But honestly,
an employer and employee--

1528
01:18:40,229 --> 01:18:41,526
what are the percentages?

1529
01:18:41,563 --> 01:18:44,464
I just want you to help me up.
I hurt my back.

1530
01:18:46,535 --> 01:18:49,629
That was a joke, by the way,
and--and a good one.

1531
01:19:02,618 --> 01:19:04,643
Goddamn vultures
are starting to circle.

1532
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:08,178
Make yourselves at home,
scumbags!

1533
01:19:09,391 --> 01:19:12,451
Calm down, Max. You're gonna
give yourself a coronary.

1534
01:19:12,494 --> 01:19:14,428
I don't have coronaries.
I give them.

1535
01:19:14,463 --> 01:19:15,953
Well, I know
this is tough for you...

1536
01:19:15,998 --> 01:19:18,432
so I just called
to wish you well.

1537
01:19:18,467 --> 01:19:21,493
My therapist won't be happy
about that, but what can I say?

1538
01:19:21,537 --> 01:19:23,004
I have a soft spot for you.

1539
01:19:23,038 --> 01:19:25,370
Well, thanks, Lutetia,
I appreciate it.

1540
01:19:25,407 --> 01:19:28,774
You might be an asshole, Max,
but you're my asshole.

1541
01:19:28,811 --> 01:19:30,711
Thanks again.

1542
01:19:30,779 --> 01:19:33,247
-Masseuse.
-I didn't order a masseuse.

1543
01:19:37,453 --> 01:19:38,681
I sent her over.

1544
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:40,551
I thought you might need
to relax.

1545
01:19:40,589 --> 01:19:42,079
You sent me a masseuse?

1546
01:19:42,124 --> 01:19:44,786
The therapeutic kind, Max...

1547
01:19:44,827 --> 01:19:46,317
not the kind you're used to.

1548
01:19:46,361 --> 01:19:49,353
I-l'll call you later, Lutetia.
Thanks.

1549
01:19:49,398 --> 01:19:50,797
It's all right, sweetie.

1550
01:19:55,571 --> 01:19:56,595
I'll get back
and check the tube, sir.

1551
01:19:56,638 --> 01:19:57,798
We're gonna nail this thief...

1552
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,137
just so bad
you won't even believe it.

1553
01:19:59,174 --> 01:20:01,005
Yeah, yeah, go nail him.

1554
01:20:03,045 --> 01:20:05,036
About last night,
I just want you to know--

1555
01:20:05,114 --> 01:20:06,638
-Get out of here!
-All right, sir.

1556
01:20:13,222 --> 01:20:15,622
Yes. I'll do it.

1557
01:20:18,727 --> 01:20:20,058
Wonderful.

1558
01:20:21,763 --> 01:20:24,357
Yeah, come here, baby.

1559
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:26,867
Must go walkies in the park
one day--

1560
01:20:26,902 --> 01:20:29,302
my dogs and yours.

1561
01:20:37,779 --> 01:20:39,144
-Excuse me.
-Go away.

1562
01:20:39,214 --> 01:20:40,806
Can't do it, sir.

1563
01:20:42,951 --> 01:20:44,213
Sorry, sir.
I heard the groaning...

1564
01:20:44,253 --> 01:20:46,255
but I'm afraid we need you.
The auction's about to start.

1565
01:20:46,388 --> 01:20:49,084
-Any sign of him?
-Not yet.

1566
01:20:54,897 --> 01:20:57,422
Would you like
a little massage oil?

1567
01:20:57,499 --> 01:21:00,332
Ooh, yeah.
A little massage oil.

1568
01:21:02,838 --> 01:21:06,365
More is coming. I shall return.

1569
01:21:06,408 --> 01:21:07,898
-Hey, how's it going?
-Good.

1570
01:21:07,943 --> 01:21:10,605
Coconut shrimps are flying
like hotcakes. Hey, wait.

1571
01:21:10,646 --> 01:21:12,045
You hitting that champagne?
Your eyes look funny.

1572
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,513
No, it's my allergies.

1573
01:21:16,318 --> 01:21:17,910
Don't get up.

1574
01:21:20,956 --> 01:21:23,288
Ladies and gentlemen...

1575
01:21:23,325 --> 01:21:24,690
please take your seats.

1576
01:21:27,029 --> 01:21:29,122
Mr. Boyle regrets
that he cannot be here...

1577
01:21:29,198 --> 01:21:31,029
to conduct the auction
as planned...

1578
01:21:31,066 --> 01:21:33,626

Didn't I tell you
you could do it?

1664

Look at the mess I caused.
Wait'll I tell the kids.

Tell them, tell them.

1666

Hey, with this watch I can move

Oh, my!

1693
01:26:56,491 --> 01:26:58,049
You're not getting away.

1694
01:27:12,774 --> 01:27:14,298
-Get off me!
-Give to me!

1695
01:27:36,197 --> 01:27:38,324
Give me it, you son of a bitch!

1696
01:27:38,366 --> 01:27:40,391
Give me that ring.

1697
01:27:40,435 --> 01:27:43,063
-Oh, shit! Man!
-There's water!

1698
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:44,765
Wait, wait. This ain't the ring.

1699
01:27:44,839 --> 01:27:47,103
-Wait are you trying to pull?
-That ain't the ring!

1700
01:27:47,175 --> 01:27:48,540
What do you mean,
that ain't the ring?

1701
01:27:48,577 --> 01:27:49,737
Whoa, water!

1702
01:27:51,079 --> 01:27:52,546
-Look.
-What?

1703
01:27:52,581 --> 01:27:55,106
-This has an inscription inside.
-Inscription?

1704
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:57,482
Yeah, it says, "Grow up."

1705
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,381
My lady said that to me.

1706
01:28:00,455 --> 01:28:02,753
My wife told me the same thing.

1707
01:28:02,791 --> 01:28:05,919
Damn! Lutetia did this.

1708
01:28:05,961 --> 01:28:08,555
She got that masseuse to oil it
right off my finger.

1709
01:28:10,832 --> 01:28:12,322
You--you joking, right?

1710
01:28:15,036 --> 01:28:17,027
Let me see that.

1711
01:28:19,174 --> 01:28:21,472
We're going down, man.

1712
01:28:21,509 --> 01:28:23,272
Max Fairbanks?

1713
01:28:25,647 --> 01:28:28,013
Max Fairbanks?
That's right. It's me...

1714
01:28:28,049 --> 01:28:29,414
and I'm arresting you
under suspicion...

1715
01:28:29,451 --> 01:28:31,078
of bankruptcy
and insurance fraud.

1716
01:28:35,557 --> 01:28:36,683
Prove it!

1717
01:28:40,362 --> 01:28:43,263
Oh! A woman scorned.

1718
01:28:46,468 --> 01:28:48,834
Kevin Caffrey.

1719
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:50,963
Is that you?

1720
01:28:51,006 --> 01:28:54,203
Hey! What up, Tardio?

1721
01:28:54,242 --> 01:28:56,938
Kevin, what are you doing here?

1722
01:28:59,314 --> 01:29:01,839
Well, uh...

1723
01:29:01,883 --> 01:29:03,908
I swam out...

1724
01:29:03,985 --> 01:29:07,443
when I saw that my fellow man
was in trouble.

1725
01:29:14,396 --> 01:29:16,591
He's a total stranger.

1726
01:29:16,631 --> 01:29:19,623
Never saw him before!
Trés bizarre.

1727
01:29:19,668 --> 01:29:22,193
Oh, yes. Trés bizarre.

1728
01:29:24,439 --> 01:29:27,033
Not as bizarre as you.

1729
01:29:27,075 --> 01:29:28,975
Thanks, Max.
I owe you one, man.

1730
01:29:29,010 --> 01:29:30,375
Ah, don't mention it.

1731
01:29:30,412 --> 01:29:33,142
You and me,
we both love the game.

1732
01:29:33,181 --> 01:29:35,274
There's no need to be penalized
for that.

1733
01:29:35,316 --> 01:29:37,750
OK, come to Tardio.

1734
01:29:37,819 --> 01:29:40,253
Go get 'em, boys and girls.

1735
01:29:40,288 --> 01:29:41,653
-Yes, sir.
-OK.

1736
01:29:57,338 --> 01:30:00,034
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Hey, hey, nothing.

1737
01:30:01,543 --> 01:30:03,875
That's my man. Go get her.

1738
01:30:08,149 --> 01:30:10,640
You? The masseuse?

1739
01:30:13,588 --> 01:30:16,682
I massaged that baby right off
his hairy little finger.

1740
01:30:16,758 --> 01:30:19,886
His wife and I
decided you two had it coming.

1741
01:30:19,928 --> 01:30:21,395
You're amazing.

1742
01:30:21,429 --> 01:30:23,329
See that ring?

1743
01:30:24,232 --> 01:30:26,223
I think it's got
the wrong kind of luck.

1744
01:30:27,602 --> 01:30:30,036
-Throw it away.
-Throw it away?

1745
01:30:30,071 --> 01:30:33,234
-We worked so hard to--
-Throw it away.

1746
01:30:33,274 --> 01:30:34,866
Gone.

1747
01:30:42,517 --> 01:30:44,883
This is Kerry Kilbride
reporting from Washington...

1748
01:30:44,919 --> 01:30:47,410
where just moments ago
a Senate committee ended...

1749
01:30:47,455 --> 01:30:49,286
its long-standing
investigation...

1750
01:30:49,324 --> 01:30:52,088
into the alleged media
and broadcasting monopoly...

1751
01:30:52,127 --> 01:30:54,789
of billionaire businessman
Max Fairbanks.

1752
01:30:54,829 --> 01:30:57,627
Through a series of quick and
effective legal maneuverings...

1753
01:30:57,665 --> 01:31:00,259
Mr. Fairbanks
and his attorney...

1754
01:31:00,335 --> 01:31:02,303
have taken
the wind out of the sails...

1755
01:31:02,370 --> 01:31:03,462
of the Senate committee.

1756
01:31:03,538 --> 01:31:04,869
Shook 'em down.

1757
01:31:04,906 --> 01:31:06,874
Brother hoodwinked
the entire Senate committee.

1758
01:31:06,941 --> 01:31:08,238
That's my boy.

1759
01:31:08,276 --> 01:31:10,767
Put on your rubber boots,
'cause here comes the bullshit.

1760
01:31:10,812 --> 01:31:13,838
We now go directly to the scene
with Tracey Kimberly.

1761
01:31:13,882 --> 01:31:15,110
This is Tracey Kimberly...

1762
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:16,981
reporting live
from the capitol...

1763
01:31:17,018 --> 01:31:19,714
where we have just witnessed
a stunning turn of events...

1764
01:31:19,754 --> 01:31:21,915
orchestrated by
a relatively unknown lawyer...

1765
01:31:21,956 --> 01:31:24,015
from the firm
of Whiteman, Small, Johnson.

1766
01:31:24,058 --> 01:31:27,425
-Whiteman, Small, Johnson?
-What do you mean by that?

1767
01:31:27,462 --> 01:31:29,726
Here he comes now.

1768
01:31:30,865 --> 01:31:34,028
Oh, look! That's my boy!
Look, he on TV?

1769
01:31:34,102 --> 01:31:35,569
Yo, look at that!
He got that big--

1770
01:31:35,637 --> 01:31:37,161
Oh, no, he didn't!

1771
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:42,540
I'd like to say
power to the people.

1772
01:31:42,577 --> 01:31:45,603
Let's rise up.
A quick shout out to my mama.

1773
01:31:45,647 --> 01:31:47,137
Mama, I love you.

1774
01:31:47,182 --> 01:31:48,444
Mr. Fairbanks,
do you have a statement?

1775
01:31:48,483 --> 01:31:51,543
Ladies and gentlemen,
I was dragged through the mud...

1776
01:31:51,586 --> 01:31:53,747
I was tarred and feathered
in the streets.

1777
01:31:53,788 --> 01:31:56,780
-Can we get an "Oop" up in here?
-Up in here!

1778
01:31:56,825 --> 01:31:59,157
I was bent over and stuffed
like a Christmas goose.

1779
01:31:59,194 --> 01:32:00,491
Can I get an "Ouch!
That's hurts"?

1780
01:32:00,528 --> 01:32:02,155
Ouch! That hurts!

1781
01:32:02,197 --> 01:32:06,190
But in the end,
the senators saw the truth--

1782
01:32:06,267 --> 01:32:09,259
that I'm an honest
and legitimate businessman.

1783
01:32:09,337 --> 01:32:12,795
Counselor, what exactly was your
game plan going in there today?

1784
01:32:12,874 --> 01:32:14,637
Well, my brethren...

1785
01:32:14,676 --> 01:32:17,839
I'm not one to stand up here
and conversate out of my ass...

1786
01:32:17,879 --> 01:32:21,440
nor am I gonna stand up here
and jerk you all off.

1787
01:32:21,482 --> 01:32:25,714
Besides the precedents
of Roe vs. Wade...

1788
01:32:25,753 --> 01:32:28,688
uh, my Uncle Ray-Ray
vs. the Dairy Queen...

1789
01:32:28,723 --> 01:32:32,090
I knew I had to get it
on the inside...

1790
01:32:32,126 --> 01:32:34,287
to the big man
for the easy lay-up.

1791
01:32:34,329 --> 01:32:37,093
I am full of de facto...

1792
01:32:37,131 --> 01:32:40,897
habeas corpus
emancipation proclamation.

1793
01:32:40,969 --> 01:32:45,338
I also have
a very, very big pro bono.

1794
01:32:46,541 --> 01:32:48,532
Baby, it runs in the family.

1795
01:32:48,610 --> 01:32:50,544
What do you believe changed
the senators' minds?

1796
01:32:50,578 --> 01:32:52,671
Fourscore, darling!

1797
01:32:52,714 --> 01:32:55,342
Yeah, I mean, hey,
everybody makes mistakes...

1798
01:32:55,383 --> 01:32:56,975
even senators.

1799
01:32:57,018 --> 01:32:58,144
Are you implying
there were improprieties...

1800
01:32:58,186 --> 01:32:59,585
on behalf of the senators?

1801
01:32:59,621 --> 01:33:03,421
Hey, man, I am a black male...

1802
01:33:03,458 --> 01:33:04,755
not a blackmailer.

1803
01:33:04,792 --> 01:33:06,555
Nobody's perfect.

1804
01:33:06,594 --> 01:33:08,824
Isn't that right,
Senator Richards?

1805
01:33:10,198 --> 01:33:12,132
-Senator Richards!
-Senator!

1806
01:33:17,972 --> 01:33:20,998
Well, heh heh! I owe you one.

1807
01:33:21,075 --> 01:33:22,702
Yeah. Hey, don't mention it.

1808
01:33:22,744 --> 01:33:24,371
You just take care of yourself.

1809
01:33:24,412 --> 01:33:26,880
-Hey, right on.
-Right on!

1810
01:33:32,487 --> 01:33:33,977
What a guy.

1811
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:39,957
Son of a bitch!

1812
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:55,000
