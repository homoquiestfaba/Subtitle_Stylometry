♪♪

3
00:00:08,574 --> 00:00:11,277
The Rumors Have
Been Out Of Control

4
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:13,779
Ever Since The Night Of
The Final Competition.

5
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:15,748
Some People Think
Danny Ran Away,

6
00:00:15,748 --> 00:00:17,950
That He's In Hiding.

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,353
Others Think He Never
Existed In The First Place.

8
00:00:21,353 --> 00:00:23,656
But Believe Me, He Is Real.

9
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:27,460
I Know. I--I Was There.

10
00:00:28,894 --> 00:00:32,064
Some Of What
I Witnessed Was...

11
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:35,635
Pretty Terrifying.

12
00:00:36,635 --> 00:00:39,872
I Saw Things That Were
So... Strange,

13
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:44,577
So... Unexpected.

14
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:46,512
Well, As Much
As I Like To Think

15
00:00:46,512 --> 00:00:50,082
I'm A Champion
Puzzle Solver

16
00:00:50,082 --> 00:00:52,318
Even I Still Haven't
Figured Out

17
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:56,090
Exactly How It
All Went Down.

18
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,893
But One Thing
I Am Sure Of...

19
00:01:00,893 --> 00:01:05,064
Danny Sinclair Is
Definitely Real

20
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:08,936
And Unlike Anybody
You've Ever Met.

21
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:14,473
Oh, And Also,
What I'm About To Show You.

22
00:01:14,473 --> 00:01:17,484
Was Never, Ever Meant
To Be Seen.

23
00:01:25,484 --> 00:01:27,052
I Was Hired To Be
A Segment Producer

24
00:01:27,052 --> 00:01:28,021
Of A New Reality
Tv Show,

25
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:30,023
Assigned To Make Sure
Every Bit Of Action

26
00:01:31,023 --> 00:01:32,858
Got Caught On Tape.

27
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:35,828
Everybody
Take A Seat, Please.

28
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:38,631
Thank You.

29
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:41,934

In Television History

31
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,372
To Be Produced
Entirely By Kids,

32
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,407
Not All Of You
Will Remain.

33
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:49,942

One Of The 3
Final Magicians

00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:55,147
Will Stay With Us
Through The Grand Finale.

36
00:01:55,147 --> 00:01:56,615
Think You're
All Up For It?

37
00:01:56,615 --> 00:01:58,584
Oh, Definitely!

38
00:01:58,584 --> 00:01:59,718
Good.

39
00:02:05,157 --> 00:02:07,393
Thank You. Heh Heh!

40
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:10,863
Before We Proceed,
What Is The Single Most

41
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:12,698
Important Rule For
Making Good Television?

42
00:02:12,698 --> 00:02:13,866
Oh!

43
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:15,034
Make Sure They Spell
Your Name Right

44
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,035
In The Credits.

45
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,437
Yeah. Yes, And You Are?

46
00:02:18,437 --> 00:02:20,773
Allyson Miller. I Think
The Most Important Rule

47
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,141
Of Good Television
Is To Always

48
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:23,609
Keep Your Camera Rolling.

49
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:24,877
Excellent.

50
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:26,145
I Couldn't Have
Said It Better Myself.

51
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:28,080
Actually, You Did.

52
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,515
I Remembered It
From A Quote You Gave

53
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:31,150
In An Interview
With <I>Tv Weekly.</I>

54
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,085
October Of 2002.

55
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:36,655
Well, It's Nice To Know
One Of You Came Prepared.

56
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:40,426
And Now It Is My Pleasure
To Introduce You

57
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,995
To Someone I'm Sure You Are
All Familiar With.

58
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:45,497
He Is Both
A World Renowned Magician

59
00:02:45,497 --> 00:02:48,901
And The Host Of Our New
Reality Television Show,

60
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:53,544
Please Welcome
The Amazing Mystic Max.

61
00:02:58,544 --> 00:02:59,012
Thank You.

62
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:02,615
Good Morning,
Ladies And Gentlemen.

63
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,650
100 Talented Magicians

64
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,186
Between The Ages
Of 10 And 16

65
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,655
Became Eligible For Our Show

66
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:12,825
By Figuring Out The Hidden
Message In This Poster.

67
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:16,161
It Appeared On Billboards,
In Magazines,

68
00:03:16,161 --> 00:03:19,632
In Newspapers
And On The Internet.

69
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,468
Hidden Somewhere In This Ad

70
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:25,237
Is A Secret Message.

71
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:27,673
Just Out Of Curiosity,
Did Any One Of You

72
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:28,907
Find The Hidden Message?

73
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:31,907
Allyson.

74
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:31,777
Big Surprise.

75
00:03:31,777 --> 00:03:33,650
Would You Care
To Show Us?

76
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,585
Well, As We All Know

77
00:03:39,585 --> 00:03:41,021
Magicians Say The Secret
To Any Good Trick

78
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,923
Is Misdirection.
That Means They're Trying To Get You

79
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:48,060
To Focus Over Here While They
Do Some Hocus Pocus Over There.

80
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,031
So Most People Probably Thought
The Clues Would Be Found

81
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,599
In The Magician
And His Trick

82
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,167
Because That's What
First Draws Your Eye,

83
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:57,903
But Truth Is It's
The Background Things

84
00:03:57,903 --> 00:03:59,805
You Need To Focus On.

85
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:01,940
See, The Spider Web
Made Me Realize

86
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,210
It Was Probably There To
Direct Us To A Web Site.

87
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,646
Then On Looking Closer At The
Book The Statue Is Holding

88
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:10,182
I Saw That It Was<I>
A Farewell To Arms,</I>

89
00:04:10,182 --> 00:04:12,785
And Then Bam! It Hit Me!

90
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,953
I Mean Everybody Knows
That The Venus De Milo

91
00:04:14,953 --> 00:04:16,188
Is A Statue With No Arms.

92
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:18,090
Sure.

93
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,526
And That Made Me Think Of The
Famous Founder Of The Magic Mansion,

94
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,597
A Magician Named
Antonio Demilo.

95
00:04:25,597 --> 00:04:27,666
I Mean, How Obvious
Could It Be?

96
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,535
This Is
A Joke, Right?

97
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,670
I Went On-Line,
Typed In Demilo.Net

98
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,039
And Got Linked Directly
To The Contest Entry Form.

99
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:37,076
Simple, Right?

100
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:40,112
Well Done, Allyson.

101
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:43,184
Oh! Thanks.

102
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,820
Know-It-All.

103
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,657
Allyson, VOICE-OVER: Ok,
So I'm Not The Best At Making Friends.

104
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:53,026
I Know I Can Seem Like
A Bit Of A Know-It-All

105
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:55,728
But I Really Don't Mean To.

106
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,330
It's Not Fault People Ask Me
Questions And I Have Answers.

107
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,632
I Mean, What Am I
Supposed To Do?

108
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,102
Hey, I'd Love It If Kids My Own
Age Could Actually Relate To Me.

109
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,304
I Mean I've Tried Pretending
I'm Into Lip Gloss

110
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:07,306
And Text Messaging
And Hanging Out At The Mall.

111
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:10,676
I Just Can't Ever Seem
To Pull It Off.

112
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:13,579
Ok, Sorry. What Got Me Off
On That Rant?

113
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,614
I Have No Idea.

114
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:19,153
Seriously, I'm Not The Story
Here. Danny Is.

115
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:23,655
Ms. Mcallister Divided Us
Into Teams.

116
00:05:23,655 --> 00:05:26,759
Each Team Had A Kid Producer,
A Kid Cameraperson.

117
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,662
And An Adult Mentor.
Our Team Was Me,

118
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:32,662
Our Camera Guy Cedric...

119
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:32,731
Peace.

120
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:34,800
And Our Mentor
Whose Name Was Paul.

121
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,235
We Were Sent To Find
The One Kid Who Could

122
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,170
Best Represent His Region
On The Show.

123
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,705
That's Good Work,
People, Good Work.

124
00:05:39,705 --> 00:05:41,240
We Had Not Idea
What We Were In For.

125
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,147
Ok, Good Luck, Everybody.
Let's Do This.

126
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,849
Come On. Hey!

127
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:52,849
Hi. Are You Blake?

128
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:52,384
Yes, I Am.

129
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:53,952
Hi, I'm Allyson.
Nice To Meet You.

130
00:05:53,952 --> 00:05:55,621
Nice To Meet You.

131
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,122
We're With The <I>World's
Greatest</I> Magician.

132
00:05:57,122 --> 00:05:59,122
Wow! Sweet!

133
00:05:57,122 --> 00:05:59,124
Yeah! You Ready
To Show Us What You Got?

134
00:05:59,124 --> 00:06:01,124
Yeah, Let's Go.

135
00:05:59,124 --> 00:06:01,393
Ok, Let's Do It.

136
00:06:01,393 --> 00:06:03,862
<I>World's Greatest
Magician,</I>

137
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:06,999
Contestant
Number One, Action!

138
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,368
Don't Take It Easy On Me.
Get It Super Tight.

139
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,803
Good Luck, Buddy.

140
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:12,072
Unh!

141
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:17,075
I Present...

142
00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:18,844
Siegfried...

143
00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:21,113
As Dog Gone!

144
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:24,082
Ok, Now Be Prepared
To Be Astounded

145
00:06:24,082 --> 00:06:26,987
As I Show You The Card
You Just Picked.

146
00:06:28,987 --> 00:06:30,222
Ta-Da!

147
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:32,691
Um, No.

148
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:36,034
The Astonishing
Linking Rings.

149
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:45,676
Unh!

150
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,315
Um... Brian?

151
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:59,384
Ok, I'm Positive That
This Is Your Card.

152
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:01,320
No.

153
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,320
This Your Card?

154
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,724
No.

155
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:09,161
Ugh!

156
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:12,002
Unh! Unh! Oh!

157
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:20,002
Go Back In! Go!

158
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,211
This One. This One!
This One?

159
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:29,381
First, I Take An Egg...

160
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:32,451
Crack It Into The Hat,
Add Some Flour

161
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,186
And A Little Milk.

162
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:37,089
After I Stir It All Up

163
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,759
And Place It On Your Head
A Cake Will Magically...

164
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:44,759
Oh, Wait, Wait, Wait!

165
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:44,162
Appear.

166
00:07:44,162 --> 00:07:47,432
You Forgot
The Rubber Cake.

167
00:07:47,432 --> 00:07:49,942
Oops.

168
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:58,944
Ok. So Basically

169
00:07:58,944 --> 00:08:00,512
I Could Describe
My Contestants

170
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:03,515
In 2 Words:

171
00:08:03,515 --> 00:08:06,084
Impressively Pathetic.

172
00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:08,086
Hmph! Bummer, Right?

173
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:11,456
If I Didn't Find Someone Who Was
Cool Enough To Put On A Show,

174
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:13,926
My First Chance At A Career
Was Gonna Be Over

175
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,962
Before It Ever Started.

176
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:21,500
Cedric And I
Were Down To Our Last Hope.

177
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,841
Oh!

178
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:31,978
Hey!

179
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:36,455
Ok, This Better
Be Good.

180
00:08:43,455 --> 00:08:45,824
Hi. Nice To Meet
You People.

181
00:08:45,824 --> 00:08:48,824
Hi.

182
00:08:45,824 --> 00:08:48,360
Nice To Meet You.

183
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,495
We're So Glad
You're Here.

184
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:52,364
Yeah.
This Is All Danny's Been Talking About For Weeks.

185
00:08:52,364 --> 00:08:55,500
Great, Good, Awesome,
Perfect, Yeah.

186
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,071
He's Been Very,
Very Anxious To Meet You People,

187
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,340
Heh!

188
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,543
Uh, Please Come In. Yeah.

189
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:06,511
Oh, Ok.

190
00:09:33,438 --> 00:09:35,844
Hello.

191
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,112
Uh...

192
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,514
Heh!

193
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:44,282
Hi. Danny.

194
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:47,252
Hi. Allyson.
Nice To Meet You.

195
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:50,252
Paul.

196
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:50,122
I'm Danny. Welcome.

197
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,024
Ready To Show Us
What You Got?

198
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:55,059
Heh. Only One Way
To Find Out.

199
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:58,296
Contestant Number 10
Danny Sinclair.

200
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:01,004
And... Action.

201
00:10:06,004 --> 00:10:08,006
1... 2...

202
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:12,444
3!

203
00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:15,180
Let Me Guess.
The Incredible Popping Balloon.

204
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,049
No, No. See, What's
Supposed To Happen

205
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:20,385
Is I Pop The Balloon
And A Dove Flies Out.

206
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:22,385
I've Done It
A Million Times.

207
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:22,054
Ok.

208
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,256
Just Let Me Try It
Again, Ok?

209
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,391
Be My Guest.

210
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:30,062
Ok. 1... 2...

211
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,197
3!

212
00:10:32,197 --> 00:10:36,568
All Right, One More
Time, One More Time.

213
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:38,303
All Right, 1...

214
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:41,275
2... 3!

215
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:47,079
All Right, Next Time-- Next Time For Sure,
Next Time For Sure.

216
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,580
You Know,
Maybe You Want To Try A Different Trick.

217
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,549
No, I Can Do This,
All Right? I Can Do This.

218
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,184
You Need Any Help?
You Want An Assistant?

219
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,319
I Mean, We Could Always
Try A Different Camera--

220
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:57,522
I'm Gonna Do It, All Right?
You Just Gotta Back Off...

221
00:10:57,522 --> 00:11:01,593
And Give Me
Another Chance.

222
00:11:01,593 --> 00:11:05,397
This Really Matters
To You, Huh?

223
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:08,135
More Than You Can
Possibly Know.

224
00:11:10,135 --> 00:11:13,638
Well, If It Makes You
Feel Any Better

225
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:16,043
I Seriously Need
For It To Happen, Too.

226
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:19,011
You're My Last Chance.

227
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:21,980
Yeah, And You're Mine,

228
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,316
So...

229
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:26,151
Let's Just Do This. Ok?

230
00:11:26,151 --> 00:11:28,120
This Time...

231
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,989
This Time It's Definitely,
Definitely Going To Work.

232
00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:33,562
Ok.

233
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:40,602
1... 2...

234
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,242
3!

235
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,116
Yeah.

236
00:11:58,116 --> 00:11:59,651
Thanks, Kid.

237
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:02,053
No, No, No, Wait A Minute,
Please, I Can Do This.

238
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:03,053
Ok, I Can--I Can Do This.

239
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:03,022
Peace.

240
00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:07,692
Guys, Guys, Plea--

241
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,134
Oh.

242
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:18,537
I Bet The Only Reason We Did A Bajillion Takes

243
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,539
Was Because Allyson Thinks The Guy's Cute.

244
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,741
The Only Reason
I Did A Bajillion Takes

245
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:26,344
Was Because Our Other 9
Magicians Really Stunk.

246
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:28,647
I--I Can't Believe I'm
Gonna Be Off The Show.

247
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,115
Hey, Now You Don't
Know That.

248
00:12:30,115 --> 00:12:32,484
One Of Our Magicians
Could Still Get Picked.

249
00:12:32,484 --> 00:12:34,119
You Seriously
Think So?

250
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:37,689
No!
But As Your Mentor I'm Supposed To Be Encouraging.

251
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,161
Whoa!

252
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:45,565
Ha Ha!

253
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,300
Tell Me You're Rolling!

254
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,701
I'm Rolling!
I Got It, I Got It!

255
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:51,139
Cedric, You Rock!

256
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:56,508
Wow, Man!
This Kid Is Good!

257
00:12:56,508 --> 00:12:58,677
You Think Danny
Did This?

258
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,154
Of Course He Did.
Who Else?

259
00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:11,556
Allyson, VOICE-OVER:
Ok, Totally Bizarre, I Know.

260
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:15,160
I Mean Danny Should've Been
Looking Really Happy Just Then,

261
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,762
But The Expression I Saw
On His Face...

262
00:13:17,762 --> 00:13:22,603
Seemed A Whole Lot
More Like... Fear.

263
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:28,506
You're Right, Allyson.
Very Impressive.

264
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:30,508
Very Impressive,
Indeed.

265
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:34,512
Yes!

266
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:35,847
I Told You It Was
Unbelievable.

267
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:37,349
Yeah, A Little
Too Unbelievable.

268
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:38,750
What Are
You Saying, Hunter?

269
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,118
Isn't It Obvious?

270
00:13:40,118 --> 00:13:41,353
Her And That Danny
Kid Must've Worked

271
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,721
The Whole Thing Out
Ahead Of Time.

272
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,089
They've Been Scamming Us From The Start.

273
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,089
We Were Not.

274
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,091
Oh, Get Real!

275
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,426
There's No Way You Pulled That Off Unless You Helped.

276
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:50,662
Hunter, Allyson Wouldn't
Do Something Like That, Ok?

277
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:53,431
She Knows The Rules.
Colluding With A Contestant

278
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:54,833
Is Strictly Forbidden.

279
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,501
Well, We All Know
How Much She Likes

280
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:58,136
To Be The Best
At Everything.

281
00:13:58,136 --> 00:13:59,771
I Was There. I Mean,
I Saw The Whole Thing.

282
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:01,673
So What?
He's On Her Team.

283
00:14:01,673 --> 00:14:03,708
Maybe He's Just As Big A Cheater As She Is.

284
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,243
We Didn't Cheat, Ok?

285
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:08,413
Yeah, Honest. I Mean--

286
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:11,116
Paul, You Were There.
What's Your Assessment?

287
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:15,290
Honestly, I Think This Kid's Real Deal.

288
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,826
I Guess We Found Our Last Contestant, Max.

289
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:24,429
Yes! Justice Prevailed.

290
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:27,432
Danny Made It Onto The Show,
Which Meant That I Did, Too.

291
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:32,304
I Was Going To Be A Part Of The
Coolest Reality Program Ever Filmed.

292
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,405
I've Been Thinking
A Lot About It

293
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,440
And You Know The Way You
Set Us Up Back At Your House

294
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,309
With The Whole,
"Oops! I'm Incompetent,

295
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,144
It's All A Big Disaster"
Thing Before You

296
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,712
Completely Blew Our
Minds With The Doves?

297
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:43,548
That Would Be The Perfect
Approach To Use In The Show, Too.

298
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:46,418
It'll Catch Everybody Off Guard And They Will Love You.

299
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,520
You Could Come Up With
Something Like That Again, Right?

300
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,188
Yeah, Yeah, Sure.
Whatever.

301
00:14:50,188 --> 00:14:52,824
Great!
Oh, And The Other Thing We Need To Talk About

302
00:14:52,824 --> 00:14:56,294
Is Costumes.
I Want Something Eye-Catching But Not Flashy,

303
00:14:56,294 --> 00:14:59,597
Classy But Not Some All Black Funeral Guy Look.

304
00:14:59,597 --> 00:15:03,234
Ooh!
What We Really Need Is Some Kind Of-- Of A Gimmick.

305
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:06,234
Wow.

306
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:06,304
An Exploding Wand,
A Parrot Sidekick--

307
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:09,474
Allyson, All Right,
Pick Any Card.

308
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:10,474
Um, Ok.

309
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:10,709
Any Card.

310
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,709
You Got It?

311
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,610
Yeah.

312
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,512
All Right, Place It
Right There.

313
00:15:14,512 --> 00:15:15,880
All Right, Here's
What I'm Donna Do.

314
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,649
All I Want You To Do
Is Say "Jump."

315
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:20,649
Jump.

316
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:20,452
Right There.

317
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,587
Oh! Whoa!

318
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:25,587
Pretty Good.

319
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:25,190
That's Awesome.

320
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,925
Here, Here, Here.
Why Don't You Do This? Pick A Card.

321
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:28,526
You Want Me
To Pick A Card?

322
00:15:28,526 --> 00:15:29,761
Pick A Card. I Want
You To Pick A Card.

323
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:30,761
All Right, Memorize It.

324
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:30,929
I Got It.

325
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:34,466
Put It Back Anywhere In The Deck.
All Right, You Got It?

326
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:38,466
I Got It.

327
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:38,503
All Right.

328
00:15:38,503 --> 00:15:39,938
Is That Your Card?

329
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:43,241
Awesome, Dude!

330
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:46,241
That's My Card.

331
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:46,845
Oh! That Was Awesome!

332
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,881
But This Whole Mopey,
Brooding Thing You've Got Going On,

333
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:52,984
It's Seriously
Not Gonna Work For Tv.

334
00:15:52,984 --> 00:15:56,625
Too Boring.

335
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,245
Wow.

336
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,480
Yes.

337
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:36,728
Welcome To
The Magic Mansion

338
00:16:36,728 --> 00:16:40,000
And Congratulations
To Our 3 Finalists.

339
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,735
It's A Real Honor
To Meet You.

340
00:16:43,735 --> 00:16:45,770
I'm Zoe And I'm From Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

341
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,971
The Honor Is Mine, Zoe.

342
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:49,808
I Am Brandon. I'm From
San Francisco, C-A.

343
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,510
Good To Meet
You, Brandon.

344
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,712
I'm Danny
From Pensacola.

345
00:16:54,712 --> 00:16:58,750
Yes.
I've Been Looking Forward To Meeting You, Danny.

346
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,019
I'd Like You All To Think Of This As Your Home.

347
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,621
Follow Me.

348
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:05,731
Wow.

349
00:17:13,731 --> 00:17:16,367
In Its
Illustrious History,

350
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:17,001
A Very Few Select People

351
00:17:18,001 --> 00:17:20,905
Have Ever Been Allowed
Inside This Mansion.

352
00:17:20,905 --> 00:17:23,475
That's Because Very Magic
Secret Known To A Man

353
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,009
And A Few Not
Yet Revealed

354
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:29,047
Are Hidden
Within These Walls.

355
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:30,415
While Here
During This Competition

356
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:33,485
You May Use Every Prop,
Every Book,

357
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:34,019
Every Illusion We Have,

358
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:38,389
And I Suggest
You Take Advantage Of It.

359
00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:41,993
Remember, You Never Know
How Strong Your Magic Is

360
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:45,730
Until You Test It.
Good Night.

361
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,633
Oh, By The Way,

362
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:52,938
You Might Want To Search Your
Pockets For Your Room Keys.

363
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:55,479
Whoa!

364
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:03,089
Danny.

365
00:18:19,497 --> 00:18:21,499
Ok, Look, Danny,
This Is How It's Going To Be

366
00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:24,502
For The Next 7 Days.
You And I Are Gonna Be Like This!

367
00:18:24,502 --> 00:18:25,670
I Want To Know
Everything About You.

368
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,372
I Want To Know What You're
Doing And What You're Thinking

369
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:28,706
24 Hours A Day
Every Day.

370
00:18:28,706 --> 00:18:30,742
Right Now I'm Thinking
That This Is My Room.

371
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,076
So?

372
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:34,612
So I'll See You
Tomorrow.

373
00:18:34,612 --> 00:18:36,047
Wait A Minute. We're Not
Done Talking Here.

374
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:38,716
One Of Us Is.

375
00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:40,716
You're Blocking My Door.

376
00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:40,451
So?

377
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:41,986
So Can We Continue This
Tomorrow, Please?

378
00:18:41,986 --> 00:18:43,154
I Have Things
I Need To Take Care Of.

379
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:45,154
What Kind Of Things?

380
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:45,957
None Of Your Business!

381
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:49,427
Danny, I Don't Think You're Getting It.

382
00:18:49,427 --> 00:18:51,629
Everything About You
Here <I>Is</I> My Business.

383
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:53,565
My Business Is To Follow Your Every Move.

384
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:56,099
Who Is This Girl?

385
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:58,870
Look, I've Watched Liked A Gazillion Hours

386
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,738
Of These Shows, Even
The Really Gross Ones,

387
00:19:00,738 --> 00:19:02,907
You Know, Where They Have To Dive
Into A Vat Of Cockroach Larvae--

388
00:19:02,907 --> 00:19:04,742
What's Your Point?

389
00:19:04,742 --> 00:19:05,009
The Contestants Who Get
The Most Screen Time

390
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:09,180
Are The Ones Who Are Wildly Charismatic,
Extremely Competitive

391
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,848
And Have Usually
Overcome

392
00:19:10,848 --> 00:19:12,483
Some Heartbreaking
Obstacle To Get Here.

393
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:14,019
Right Now The Only Heartbreaking
Obstacle In My Life Is You.

394
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:17,021
Oh, Come On, Please!
We're A Team.

395
00:19:18,021 --> 00:19:20,558
Oh, Yeah? Then How
About A Team Cheer?

396
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,128
Like, Uh,
Go, Team, Go!

397
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:26,032
Ha Ha Ha!

398
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:32,505
Danny, You're Not
Funny! Open Up!

399
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:37,141
Look, There's Things About Me
You're Not Gonna Understand

400
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:39,510
Not Matter
How Much We Talk.

401
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,745
So How About
We Make A Deal.

402
00:19:40,745 --> 00:19:43,548
I Promise I Will Do Whatever I
Can To Win This Thing For You

403
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:45,116
As Long As The Rest
Of The Time

404
00:19:45,116 --> 00:19:48,620
You Leave Me Alone.
All Right.

405
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,088
Excuse Me, Did He
Seriously Think

406
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:53,725
A Bargain Like That
Would Stop Me?

407
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,094
Ugh! I Mean,
What Was He Up To?

408
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,930
And Why Was He Being
So Mysterious?

409
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,498
As Far As
I Was Concerned

410
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:03,501
Danny Sinclair Was My Favorite Kind Of Challenge:

411
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:06,471
Just One More Puzzle
Begging To Be Solved.

412
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:10,040
My Mentor And The Founder
Of The Magic Mansion

413
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,044
Antonio Demilo
Was Once Asked,

414
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:16,180
What Is A Magician's
Greatest Asset?

415
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,815
And He Replied--

416
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:19,584
"A Magician's
Greatest Asset

417
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:22,520
Is The Ability To Think
In Unusual Ways."

418
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,156
Well, That's Very
Impressive, Mr. Sinclair.

419
00:20:25,156 --> 00:20:29,661
Yes, The Ability To
Think In Unusual Ways,

420
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,596
And That Is Exactly
What The Nature

421
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:33,765
Of Your First
Challenge Entails.

422
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:36,636
Watch Carefully.

423
00:20:38,636 --> 00:20:40,872
A Basketball.

424
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,872
Oh!

425
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,975
Oh, Wow!

426
00:20:43,975 --> 00:20:46,045
A Rope.

427
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:51,649
A Broom,
A 10-Gallon Aquarium

428
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:54,857
And A Bed Sheet.

429
00:20:59,857 --> 00:21:02,860
5 Very Different Yet Common
Household Items

430
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,229
And You Have
Exactly 30 Minutes

431
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:08,566
To Create An Illusion
Using Any Or All

432
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:09,934
Of These 5 Objects.

433
00:21:09,934 --> 00:21:12,203
Just Those Things
And Nothing Else?

434
00:21:12,203 --> 00:21:15,139
Just Those Things,
Nothing Else.

435
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:18,776
And The Clock Is Ticking.

436
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:21,646
I Know. It's Gonna Be
Totally Perfect.

437
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:23,581
Where
Are My Cameramen?

438
00:21:23,581 --> 00:21:26,050
There's Cedric.

439
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,553
So, Uh, Danny, Now That
You've Done All This

440
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,955
Intense But Not Very Interesting To Watch Thinking,

441
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:32,023
Anything You'd Like To
Hop Up And Show Us?

442
00:21:33,023 --> 00:21:34,026
Anything You Want
To Try?

443
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:38,196
Any Probably Futile But Charming
First Attempt You'd Care To Perform?

444
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:41,666
Have I Mentioned You're Making
It Hard For Me To Concentrate?

445
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,569
Ok, Maybe You've Never
Watched Much Tv,

446
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,604
But As I Said Before
It Has To Be Active,

447
00:21:46,604 --> 00:21:48,740
It Has To Be Captivating-- Where Are You Going?

448
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,808
I Can't Do This.

449
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,343
What Do You Mean? No, No, No,
You Have To Do This.

450
00:21:52,343 --> 00:21:54,078
Listen, I Shouldn't Have Came Here In The First Place,

451
00:21:54,078 --> 00:21:56,748
Especially Not If I Knew
I'd End Up With You.

452
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:57,982
It Might Help If You Try
Clueing Me In, You Know.

453
00:21:57,982 --> 00:22:00,084
What's This Really About?
Is It Stage Fright?

454
00:22:00,084 --> 00:22:01,786
Are You Freaked Out
About Having To Perform

455
00:22:01,786 --> 00:22:03,321
In Front Of
A Bunch Of Cameras?

456
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:04,956
If You Are,
I Totally Understand.

457
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,924
Just Tell Me And We Can
Figure Out How To Work On It.

458
00:22:06,924 --> 00:22:09,924
It's Not Stage Fright.

459
00:22:06,924 --> 00:22:09,093
Then What?

460
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:11,093
I'm Only Trying To Help.

461
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:11,729
Yeah, Well, You Can't.

462
00:22:11,729 --> 00:22:13,197
I'm Not The Enemy,
You Know.

463
00:22:13,197 --> 00:22:15,600
Cedric And I
Are Your Friends.

464
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,938
Right, Cedric?

465
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:23,941
Cedric! Attention, Please!
Yeah, Thanks.

466
00:22:23,941 --> 00:22:25,777
Huh?

467
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,145
I Was Trying
To Assure Danny

468
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,946
That He's Got Whatever Support He Needs

469
00:22:28,946 --> 00:22:31,783
Because You And I
Are Here For Him.

470
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,151
Yeah, For Sure.

471
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,786
See?

472
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,687
Great. Well, Now That
We Have That Established

473
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:37,955
Let's Just Cut
The Chitter-Chatter

474
00:22:37,955 --> 00:22:40,725
So I Can Focus
On My Trick.

475
00:22:40,725 --> 00:22:44,400
Uh... Good.

476
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,669
100 Have Tried,

477
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:54,138
But Only 3 Have Survived.

478
00:22:54,138 --> 00:22:57,074
And Now The Stakes
Get Even Higher.

479
00:22:57,074 --> 00:22:59,210
3 Kids, 7 Days,

480
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,813
Only One Winner.

481
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:06,350
Who Will Be The World's
Greatest Kid Magician?

482
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,952
The Challenge Begins.

483
00:23:07,952 --> 00:23:11,689

500
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,830
Max Must've Thought So, Too,
Because He Gave Her

501
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,199

A Possible 10.

So What Are You
Gonna Do?

506
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,478
Not A Clue.

507
00:24:07,478 --> 00:24:10,478
I'm Not Laughing.

508
00:24:07,478 --> 00:24:10,314
Good.

509
00:24:10,314 --> 00:24:12,823
Because Neither Am I.

510
00:24:18,823 --> 00:24:21,795
A Fish Tank.

511
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:27,965
Uh, A Basketball.

512
00:24:27,965 --> 00:24:30,835
A Rope, A Broom.
Yeah, We Know.

Broom.

Right! You Don't Stand
A Snowball's Chance

520
00:24:51,856 --> 00:24:53,190
In You-Know-Where
Of Pulling That Off.

521
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:57,129
Oh, Yeah? Watch
And Be Amazed.

522
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,532

Hey, What's Going On?

527
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:11,245
Don't Stop.
Keep Going, Keep Rolling.

528
00:25:14,245 --> 00:25:15,846
Whoa.

529
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:17,848
Very Impressive.
That's Truly Original.

530
00:25:17,848 --> 00:25:21,852
Uh... Thanks.

531
00:25:21,852 --> 00:25:23,321
Yeah, But Nothing
Disappeared.

532
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:26,959
What--What's With
That White Stuff?

533
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,360
The Trick Is Nothing.

534
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,360
It's Real Snow.

535
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,296
Who Does
This Guy Think He Is?

536
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:36,500
Hey, Hunter, Catch!

537
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,502
Wait. You Said
The Contestants

538
00:25:38,502 --> 00:25:41,305
Can Only Use The 5 Original Objects,
But He Used This.

539
00:25:41,305 --> 00:25:43,841
Yeah! Snow Isn't
One Of The Props.

540
00:25:43,841 --> 00:25:46,110
That's Ridiculous!
He Just Did

541
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,845
The Most Amazing Trick
I've Ever Seen.

542
00:25:47,845 --> 00:25:49,447
It Doesn't Matter.
Rules Are Rules.

543
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:53,284
Only The Original 5 Objects, Max.
That's What You Said.

544
00:25:53,284 --> 00:25:56,954
Yes, The Challenge Was To
Think In Unusual Ways, Danny,

545
00:25:56,954 --> 00:25:58,088
And You Certainly
Accomplished That.

546
00:25:58,088 --> 00:26:00,088
Yes!

547
00:25:58,088 --> 00:26:00,124
But Technically Speaking

548
00:26:00,124 --> 00:26:01,525
Hunter Is Right.

549
00:26:01,525 --> 00:26:04,395
You Were Meant To
Use 5 Objects Only,

550
00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:08,299
So I'm Gonna
Give You A 3.

551
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:11,369
Yes!

552
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:15,840
Ok, Let's Clean Up The Stage.
Brandon, You're Next.

553
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,309
If It's Ok,
I'd Like To Use An Assistant For This.

554
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:21,979
Danny's Right There.
Use Him.

555
00:26:21,979 --> 00:26:25,885
But--

556
00:26:27,885 --> 00:26:32,156
Oh,
Stand By. Here We Go.

557
00:26:32,156 --> 00:26:34,625
Everybody Get Ready.

558
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:37,995
Oh. I Call This
Trick...

559
00:26:37,995 --> 00:26:40,531
Clean Sweep.
Heh Heh Heh!

560
00:26:40,531 --> 00:26:42,867
Now, Danny,
If You Could Unfold This Sheet

561
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,435
And Hold It Up
Like A Curtain.

562
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:47,572
Easy Enough.

563
00:26:48,572 --> 00:26:52,176
All Right, Danny,
If You Could Raise The Sheet A Bit Higher.

564
00:26:52,176 --> 00:26:55,146
You Know,
Technically I'm Not One Your 5 Approved Items.

565
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:59,520
Just Raise The Sheet, Ok?
Don't Be A Freak. Heh Heh!

566
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,957
And Now For The Most Amazing Feat You Have Ev--

567
00:27:06,957 --> 00:27:10,430
Brandon? Uh-Oh.

568
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,532
Brandon?

569
00:27:21,372 --> 00:27:22,473
Heh!

570
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:25,576
That's--I Don't Know.

571
00:27:25,576 --> 00:27:28,282
Go With It.
Max Seems Ok.

572
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:46,178
That Is So Crazy.

573
00:28:01,178 --> 00:28:04,551
Just Keep Rolling.

574
00:28:07,551 --> 00:28:10,187
Will You Slow Down?
What Happened Back There?

575
00:28:10,187 --> 00:28:11,555
It Was Brandon's Trick.
You Ask Him.

576
00:28:11,555 --> 00:28:13,555
No, I Saw--

577
00:28:11,555 --> 00:28:13,257
Saw What?

578
00:28:13,257 --> 00:28:14,391
I Think You're
Hiding Something.

579
00:28:14,391 --> 00:28:15,526
Yeah, Well,
You're Wrong.

580
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:16,994
Are You Gonna Start
Letting Me In?

581
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:18,095
If Something's Going On
Maybe I Could Help.

582
00:28:18,095 --> 00:28:21,098
Thanks, But No Thanks.
I Need To Sort This Out Myself.

583
00:28:21,098 --> 00:28:22,666
I Can't Be Your Friend
If You Don't Give Me

584
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:25,503
Something To Work With,
You Know.

585
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:28,339
Look, I Realize
I Come On A Little Strong

586
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:31,108
And Maybe... Well,
I'm Sure I've Gotten

587
00:28:31,108 --> 00:28:32,376
Too Caught Up In Trying
To Figure You Out,

588
00:28:32,376 --> 00:28:34,011
But I've Got A Feeling We Might
Actually Really Like Each Other

589
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:38,017
If We Didn't Have To Be In Combat Mode Every Second.

590
00:28:40,017 --> 00:28:41,017
Ok.

591
00:28:40,017 --> 00:28:41,719
Uhh!

592
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:44,255
Can We Try Calling A Truce For A Minute Or Two?

593
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:45,689
Sure, Why Not?

594
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:49,260
Great. So How Did Brandon
End Up On That Wheel?

595
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,728
I Don't Know. You're
The Puzzle Solver.

596
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:52,196
Why Don't
You Tell Me?

597
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:00,285
Ugh!

598
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:16,420
This Is Where He Was
Standing, Right?

599
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,290
How Should I Know?
Can We Do This In The Morning?

600
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,492
I Mean This Place
Creeps Me Out.

601
00:29:21,492 --> 00:29:23,160
No Trapdoor.

602
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,095
There's No Way Brandon Could've Pulled That Trick Off

603
00:29:25,095 --> 00:29:26,530
Without A Trapdoor.

604
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,399
Who Cares How Brandon
Pulled Off The Trick?

605
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,667
I Mean, It's Past
Curfew, It's Dark.

606
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,667
We're Gonna Get Caught.

607
00:29:31,168 --> 00:29:34,475
Shh! Someone's COMING!

608
00:29:38,475 --> 00:29:42,546
I Know There's
A Trapdoor Here.

609
00:29:42,546 --> 00:29:43,781
Hi, Guys.

610
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:46,450
What Are You
Doing Here?

611
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,785
Same Thing You Are.

612
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:49,720
Admiring The Fine Workmanship Of The Floorboards.

613
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,622
Pretty Impressive Trick You Did This Afternoon.

614
00:29:51,622 --> 00:29:53,490
Sometimes I Even
Amaze Myself.

615
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,559
I'm Sure You Do.
No Trapdoor.

616
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,294
Yeah, So?

617
00:29:57,294 --> 00:29:59,797
Let's Just Say This.
I Have No Idea What Really Went On,

618
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:01,699
But I Know It Wasn't You Who Pulled It Off.

619
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,267
Ok, So Prove It.

620
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:06,237
Maybe I Will.

621
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:08,241
Ooh-Ooh!

622
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:11,809
Look, There's Gotta Be A Trapdoor Here Somewhere.

623
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:13,844
Keeping Looking.

624
00:30:13,844 --> 00:30:15,412
Look Over There.

625
00:30:15,412 --> 00:30:17,548
Ok.

626
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:29,159
Good Morning,
Everyone.

627
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:31,428
I Trust You Had
A Good Night's Rest.

628
00:30:31,428 --> 00:30:33,764
Now Let's Start.

629
00:30:33,764 --> 00:30:37,101
For The Second Challenge

630
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,870
Each Contestant
Will Receive A Wand

631
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,640
Bearing A Famous
Magician's Name.

632
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,842
Zoe.

633
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:48,379
Oh, Wow!

634
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:50,447
Alexander Herrmann.

635
00:30:50,447 --> 00:30:53,351
Brandon.

636
00:30:54,351 --> 00:30:57,855
Oh! Harry Blackstone.

637
00:30:57,855 --> 00:31:00,624
And Last But Not Least,

638
00:31:00,624 --> 00:31:02,493
The Great Harry Houdini

639
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,595
Is For Danny.

640
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,397
Oh!

641
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,432
Wow!

642
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:11,835
The Challenge For You Three
Is To Research Your Magician.

643
00:31:11,835 --> 00:31:14,571
Select And Perform
His Most Renowned Trick.

644
00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:16,874
<I>Buona Fortuna.</I>

645
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:18,642
No Way!
This Is So Cool.

646
00:31:18,642 --> 00:31:20,248
That's Awesome.

647
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,655
Ohh. Anybody Seen Danny?

648
00:31:31,655 --> 00:31:33,457
Can't Exactly Say
I've Been Looking.

649
00:31:33,457 --> 00:31:37,828
He's Probably Somewhere
In The Stacks.

650
00:31:37,828 --> 00:31:40,798
You Know What?
Get Some Shots Of This And I'll Find Danny.

651
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:42,587
Sounds Good.

652
00:32:03,587 --> 00:32:07,591
Hey, This Is Great.
You're Actually Studying.

653
00:32:07,591 --> 00:32:09,460
What's Up?

654
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,729
I'm, Uh--

655
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:13,897
I Don't See Any Houdini
Books Here In This Mess.

656
00:32:13,897 --> 00:32:15,766
Don't Worry About It.
I've Got That Wired.

657
00:32:15,766 --> 00:32:18,335
Then What's This
All About?

658
00:32:18,335 --> 00:32:21,472
It's, Um, A Long Story.

659
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,540
I've Got Time. Hmm.

660
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,809
Ok, You're Always Claiming To Be The Puzzle Queen.

661
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:27,878
Maybe You Actually
Can Help.

662
00:32:27,878 --> 00:32:29,580
I'd Love To.

663
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,350
See, Every Book Or Web Site I've
Read About The Magic Mansion

664
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:36,320
Talks About Its Secret Rooms Or Hidden Chambers.

665
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,222
I Mean
Even Max Mentioned

666
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:39,623
All The Magical Mystery
That This Place Holds.

667
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:42,326
Ok, More
Information, Please.

668
00:32:42,326 --> 00:32:44,795
Well, I've Been Searching
Through These Books That Are

669
00:32:44,795 --> 00:32:47,731
Supposed To Tell The Mansion History, But...

670
00:32:47,731 --> 00:32:49,733
I Mean They Were
No More Revealing

671
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:52,469
Than Anything I Could've Gotten Out Of A Public Library.

672
00:32:52,469 --> 00:32:54,338
Where's All
The Secret Stuff?

673
00:32:54,338 --> 00:32:58,342
It's Gotta Be Around
Here Someplace.

674
00:32:58,342 --> 00:32:59,943
Hold On.

675
00:32:59,943 --> 00:33:02,613
W-What Are You Doing?

676
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:04,681
J-Just Give Me
A Second, Ok?

677
00:33:04,681 --> 00:33:05,749
Could You Please Tell Me
What You're Doing?

678
00:33:05,749 --> 00:33:07,985
Look, See How
Some Of These Books

679
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:10,721
Have Markings On Their Bindings And Others Don't?

680
00:33:10,721 --> 00:33:14,536
We Need To Find All Those That Have This Symbol.
Come On.

681
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:26,003
All Right, What Now?

682
00:33:27,003 --> 00:33:28,705
See This On The Binding?

683
00:33:28,705 --> 00:33:30,808
I'm Betting These Are
Your Puzzle Pieces, Pal.

684
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,543
Now It's Up To Us
To Solve It.

685
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:35,412
Allyson,
You're Brilliant.

686
00:33:35,412 --> 00:33:37,281
Thanks For Noticing.

687
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:39,488
Don't Mention It.
Let's Get To Work.

688
00:33:44,488 --> 00:33:46,590
Ok, Uh...
Oh, Try This One.

689
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:49,928
Switch Those Two.

690
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,930
The Head Goes--
Yeah.

691
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:53,798
Oh, This One.

692
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:56,636
Yeah, That's The Head,
There's The Tail.

693
00:33:59,636 --> 00:34:00,737
Danny, Look.

694
00:34:00,737 --> 00:34:03,007
Wow!
Serpents.

695
00:34:04,007 --> 00:34:06,877
There's 2 Serpents--

696
00:34:06,877 --> 00:34:08,345
Do You Recognize It?

697
00:34:08,345 --> 00:34:09,446
I've Seen This.

698
00:34:09,446 --> 00:34:11,748
I Can't Believe
You Figured This Out.

699
00:34:11,748 --> 00:34:14,751
Well, Come On,
Anybody Could Have Done It.

700
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:17,454
Not Me.

701
00:34:17,454 --> 00:34:19,623
I've Seen This
Someplace Before.

702
00:34:19,623 --> 00:34:20,623
There It Is.

703
00:34:19,623 --> 00:34:20,858
What Does It Mean?

704
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:25,529
It Means If We Want To Figure
Out Where This Is Leading Us,

705
00:34:25,529 --> 00:34:28,332
We Have To Find
This Symbol.

706
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:31,335
We Find The Symbol,
We Find The Secret Room.

707
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:33,871
Follow Me.

708
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:36,759
Great.
Let's Get Cedric.

709
00:34:55,759 --> 00:34:56,827
This Way.

710
00:34:56,827 --> 00:34:58,799
Come On.

711
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:05,903
Uh, Guys, I Don't Think
This Is Such A Good Idea.

712
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,571
Would You Rather Stay
Here By Yourself?

713
00:35:07,571 --> 00:35:09,012
No.

714
00:35:23,085 --> 00:35:25,789
Ok, It's Got To Be
The Other Way.

715
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:27,595
Come On.

716
00:35:31,595 --> 00:35:32,913
Yes!

717
00:35:49,913 --> 00:35:51,913
Look Out!

718
00:35:49,913 --> 00:35:51,515
Aah!

719
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:54,618
What Was That?

720
00:35:54,618 --> 00:35:56,553
Follow Me.

721
00:35:56,553 --> 00:35:59,127
This Place Gives Me
The Creeps.

722
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:05,029
Great.
A Dead End.

723
00:36:06,029 --> 00:36:07,764
Hey, Guys,
Let's Get Out Of Here.

724
00:36:07,764 --> 00:36:09,600
Wait, Wait, Wait.
This Is It.

725
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,768
This Is The Symbol.

726
00:36:11,768 --> 00:36:14,638
Ok, So We Found It.
Now What Do We Do?

727
00:36:14,638 --> 00:36:15,672
I Don't Know.
I Don't Know.

728
00:36:15,672 --> 00:36:17,441
Just Come On,
Help Me Out.

729
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:19,509
Ok, That's It.
I'm Getting Out Of Here.

730
00:36:19,509 --> 00:36:21,511
Hold On, Hold On,
Hold On, Hold On.

731
00:36:21,511 --> 00:36:23,680
Maybe This Is A Clue.

732
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,784
<I>"Qui Libri Legat Aracana Intra Reperiet."</I>

733
00:36:27,784 --> 00:36:28,885
What Does That Mean?

734
00:36:28,885 --> 00:36:31,488
It Means "Whoever Reads Books Finds Secrets Within."

735
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:32,023
Or Maybe
It's A Misdirection.

736
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:35,692
That's What
I'm Thinking.

737
00:36:35,692 --> 00:36:37,094
This Book Is
Made Of Stone

738
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:38,962
And If You Want To Read A Book,
You Have To--

739
00:36:38,962 --> 00:36:41,634
You Have To Turn The Pages!

740
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,606
Whoa.

741
00:36:49,606 --> 00:36:51,642
We Really Ought To Get
Out Of Here. Something's--

742
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:03,887
Let's Get
Out Of Here!

743
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:06,887
You Guys Ready?

744
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:06,690
Are You Getting This?

745
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:07,924
Uh-Huh.

746
00:37:07,924 --> 00:37:09,526
Come On, Cedric.

747
00:37:09,526 --> 00:37:10,994
Have I Mentioned That
I'm A Little Claustrophobic?

748
00:37:10,994 --> 00:37:12,996
Will You Come On?
We Need You.

749
00:37:24,274 --> 00:37:26,643
This Is
Pretty Creepy.

750
00:37:26,643 --> 00:37:27,544
I'm Not Sure
I'm Really Claustrophobic--

751
00:37:27,544 --> 00:37:29,179
Shh! We Probably Don't
Need Anybody To Know

752
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:30,079
That We're Here.

753
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,648
Why Not?
It's Not Like Anything Bad

754
00:37:31,648 --> 00:37:33,185
Is Gonna Happen, Right?

755
00:37:39,122 --> 00:37:40,757
How Did You
Do That?

756
00:37:40,757 --> 00:37:42,528
With A Lot Of Practice.

757
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:46,065
Aah!

758
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:50,067
Now How Are We Gonna
Get Out Of Here?

759
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:51,702
Guys, This Way.
Come On.

760
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:54,610
Oh, Now What?

761
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,187
Wow, Here It Is.

762
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:11,995
Wow.

763
00:38:18,995 --> 00:38:21,032
Hey, Guys,
Have I Mentioned That I'm Really,

764
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:24,167
Really, Really
Claustrophobic?

765
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:25,036
Just Get In Here, Cedric.

766
00:38:27,036 --> 00:38:28,872
I Can't Believe It.

767
00:38:28,872 --> 00:38:32,211
We Found De Milo's
Secret Library.

768
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:38,315
Now That We're Here,
What Are We Looking For?

769
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:40,217
Hey, Guys,

770
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:41,752
I Wonder What
This Does?

771
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:42,752
Cedric, Wait!

772
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:42,953
No, Don't!

773
00:38:49,092 --> 00:38:51,294
Ha Ha Ha!
That Was Awesome!

774
00:38:51,294 --> 00:38:53,830
Can Someone Please Explain
To Me What Just Happened?

775
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,165
I Don't Know,
But Things Just Keep

776
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:56,900
Getting Stranger
By The Second.

777
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,368
No Kidding.

778
00:38:58,368 --> 00:39:00,270
Let's Get Out Of Here.

779
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:03,206
I Hope You're Ready
For Your Next Challenge.

780
00:39:11,314 --> 00:39:13,216
I Proudly Present To You

781
00:39:13,216 --> 00:39:15,986
A Classic Trick Invented
By Alexander Herrmann,

782
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:17,821
But Performed By Countless
Renowned Magicians

783
00:39:17,821 --> 00:39:19,960
Over The Years.

784
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,765
Aw!

785
00:39:28,765 --> 00:39:30,237
They're So Cute.

786
00:39:34,237 --> 00:39:36,820
Maybe That One's Stuck.

787
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,857
For Generations,
Harry Blackstone Amazed People

788
00:39:53,857 --> 00:39:56,126
With His Levitation
Of A Light Bulb.

789
00:39:57,694 --> 00:40:00,949
I Will Now Attempt
The Same Illusion.

790
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,729
Whoa.

791
00:40:34,731 --> 00:40:35,832
He Got An 8.

792
00:40:35,832 --> 00:40:37,701
That's Great.

793
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:39,407
All Right, You're Up.

794
00:40:44,407 --> 00:40:46,209
Although Houdini
Was World Famous

795
00:40:46,209 --> 00:40:48,912
For His Incredible Escapes,
What You're About To Witness

796
00:40:48,912 --> 00:40:51,748
Was The Most Mystifying
Stage Illusion Ever.

797
00:40:51,748 --> 00:40:53,383
To This Day,
Very Few People People Know

798
00:40:53,383 --> 00:40:56,052
How Houdini Made
A 10,000 Pound Elephant

799
00:40:56,052 --> 00:40:58,088
Vanish In A Flash.

800
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:59,823
And Now,
Ladies And Gentlemen,

801
00:40:59,823 --> 00:41:02,125
As I Attempt To Recreate
This Stunning Feat,

802
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:05,495
May I Present To You
My Very Own Highly-Trained,

803
00:41:05,495 --> 00:41:10,368
Yet Deadly, Dangerous,
Wild Elephant.

804
00:41:20,076 --> 00:41:23,246
You Know,
I Might Be Dressed Like An Elephant,

805
00:41:23,246 --> 00:41:26,049
But I Feel Like
A Horse's Behind.

806
00:41:26,049 --> 00:41:28,355
Get Over It.
All Right?

807
00:41:32,355 --> 00:41:34,257
And Now,
Ladies And Gentlemen,

808
00:41:34,257 --> 00:41:37,127
For The First Time
In Over 80 Years,

809
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:41,131
May I Present To You
Houdini's Original...

810
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:43,867
Yee-Hah!
Ha Ha Ha!

811
00:41:43,867 --> 00:41:46,169
Vanishing Elephant.

812
00:41:46,169 --> 00:41:50,208
Whoa!
Ha Ha Ha!

813
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:54,244
Whoa!
Whoa!

814
00:41:54,244 --> 00:41:55,079
Uhh!

815
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:00,121
Hey, Hey, Brandon?

816
00:42:05,121 --> 00:42:06,489
You Ok?

817
00:42:06,489 --> 00:42:08,226
What?

818
00:42:10,226 --> 00:42:14,531
Ok, People!
Everybody Keep Quiet!

819
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:17,400
Everybody Calm Down!
One At A Time!

820
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,568
He Has To Be
Kicked Off The Show.

821
00:42:18,568 --> 00:42:19,436
You're Just Jealous.

822
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:22,572
Your Guy Levitated
A 60-Watt Light Bulb.

823
00:42:22,572 --> 00:42:24,808
I Mean, My Guy Made
A Mechanical Bull Appear.

824
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:25,009
That's Exactly
My Point.

825
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:27,210
There's No Way
He Could Do That.

826
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,210
But He Did.

827
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,812
Ok, How?

828
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:30,079
How Did You Do It?

829
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,114
A Good Magician
Never Reveals

830
00:42:31,114 --> 00:42:33,985
The Secrets Of His Tricks.

831
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:36,987
Or Maybe It's
Because He Can't.

832
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:38,989
Because It
Wasn't A Trick.

833
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:41,524
Then What Was It, Hunter?

834
00:42:41,524 --> 00:42:45,395
I, Uh--

835
00:42:45,395 --> 00:42:48,599
I Think Maybe
It Was Real.

836
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,334
Real?

837
00:42:51,334 --> 00:42:54,971
Like, What If He Actually
Has Magical Powers?

838
00:42:54,971 --> 00:42:56,840
Yeah, Right.

839
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,509
Do You Have Any Idea
How Crazy You Sound?

840
00:42:59,509 --> 00:43:01,344
Look, It's Possible, Ok?

841
00:43:01,344 --> 00:43:03,580
I Mean, There's A Lot
Of Bizarre Things

842
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,516
We Can't Explain Like E.S.P.,
Mind Readers--

843
00:43:06,516 --> 00:43:08,251
And Donald Trump's Hair.

844
00:43:08,251 --> 00:43:11,855
And People Who Make Mechanical
Bulls Appear Out Of Thin Air.

845
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:13,256
Exactly.

846
00:43:13,256 --> 00:43:15,558
And While We're At It,
I Think It Was Danny Here

847
00:43:15,558 --> 00:43:17,994
Who Made Brandon Disappear
During The First Challenge.

848
00:43:20,463 --> 00:43:24,134
Look, As Much As I Believe
It's A Total Violation

849
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,169
Of The Magician's Code,

850
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:28,338
Why Don't You Just Tell Them
How You Did Your Trick

851
00:43:28,338 --> 00:43:30,540
So We Can Move On.

852
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,976
You Heard Her, Man.
Give It Up.

853
00:43:32,976 --> 00:43:35,111
Yeah, Come On.
Just Tell Us All How You Did It, Ok?

854
00:43:35,111 --> 00:43:35,111
We Really Want
To Know.

855
00:43:35,912 --> 00:43:38,648
Ok, Fine!
All Right, Hunter's Right.

856
00:43:38,648 --> 00:43:39,983
Huh?

857
00:43:39,983 --> 00:43:41,184
I Don't Know
How I Did It.

858
00:43:41,184 --> 00:43:43,920
I Don't Understand Anything
About Any Of This.

859
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,289
These Things
Just Happen To Me!

860
00:43:46,289 --> 00:43:48,359
Ok, There.
You Happy?

861
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,195
Very Good, Danny.
That's The Ideal Answer.

862
00:43:52,195 --> 00:43:54,330
You're Really Learning How To Play This Game,
Aren't You?

863
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:56,533
What's That Supposed
To Mean?

864
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,668
Danny Just Evoked One
Of The Oldest Tricks

865
00:43:58,668 --> 00:44:02,072
In The Magician's
Black Bag.

866
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:04,240
I Have No Idea What
You're Talking About.

867
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,443
Do You Realize
How Many Classic Illusionists

868
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:09,279
Have Garnered
Endless Reams Of Publicity

869
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:11,548
By Claiming To Have
Actual Paranormal Powers?

870
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:13,116
But I'm Serious,
All Right?

871
00:44:13,116 --> 00:44:15,351
I Don't Know How That
Mechanical Contraption Got There.

872
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:17,987
Brandon Said He Felt
Like A Horse's Rear End

873
00:44:17,987 --> 00:44:18,988
And There It Was.

874
00:44:18,988 --> 00:44:21,558
Well, That's
Very Interesting.

875
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:23,560
So, I Suppose
You'll Have No Objection

876
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,563
To My Getting Together
A Group Of Distinguished Experts

877
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:28,631
To Test Your Claim?

878
00:44:28,631 --> 00:44:31,034
Well, What Sort Of Experts
Are We Talking About, Max?

879
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:34,537
Well, As President Of The Worldwide Skeptics Society,

880
00:44:34,537 --> 00:44:36,206
You Might Want
To Start With Me.

881
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:39,343
Worldwide Skeptics?

882
00:44:40,343 --> 00:44:41,344
You?

883
00:44:41,344 --> 00:44:43,246
Surprised?
Don't Be.

884
00:44:43,246 --> 00:44:46,049
No One Knows Better
Than A Professional Magician

885
00:44:46,049 --> 00:44:48,685
What Nonsense
Real Powers Are.

886
00:44:48,685 --> 00:44:51,354
In Fact, There's A Long,
Illustrious History

887
00:44:51,354 --> 00:44:54,991
Of True Magicians Debunking
Paranormal Pretenders.

888
00:44:54,991 --> 00:44:55,926
Because What We Do Is,

889
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:59,362
We Provide Precisely
Practiced Entertainment,

890
00:44:59,362 --> 00:45:01,364
And Every Fraud
Who Comes Along

891
00:45:01,364 --> 00:45:04,200
Only Serves
To Devalue Our Skills.

892
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,536
So What Do You Say,
Young Man?

893
00:45:06,536 --> 00:45:10,713
Would You Like To Settle This
Nonsense Once And For All?

894
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:20,150
Danny!

895
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,753
Are You In There?

896
00:45:23,753 --> 00:45:26,356
The Panel Of Experts
Was Waiting

897
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:29,266
And Danny Was Nowhere
To Be Found.

898
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:38,401
Call It My Own E.S.P.
Or Whatever,

899
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:40,703
But After Checking
Every Place I Could Think Of,

900
00:45:40,703 --> 00:45:43,548
I Finally Found Him.

901
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,750
What Are You
Doing In Here?

902
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,052
The Panel's Waiting.

903
00:45:57,052 --> 00:45:58,390
Danny?

904
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,691
It's No Use.
I Can't Do This.

905
00:46:01,691 --> 00:46:03,526
What?
Why Not?

906
00:46:03,526 --> 00:46:06,663
Whatever Way It Ends Up,
It's Just Gonna Be A Complete Disaster For Me.

907
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:07,664
Why?

908
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:09,299
So Far, You've Played It
Perfectly.

909
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:12,068
Seriously,
Do You Have Any Idea

910
00:46:12,068 --> 00:46:13,173
What Great Tv
You've Been Creating?

911
00:46:17,173 --> 00:46:20,343
Wait, You Don't--
You Don't Honestly Think

912
00:46:20,343 --> 00:46:22,179
You Have Real Powers,
Do You?

913
00:46:23,179 --> 00:46:26,416
Look, I Need To Explain
Something To You,

914
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:27,217
But You Got To Promise Me

915
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:29,152
That You Will
Just Sit There Quietly

916
00:46:29,152 --> 00:46:31,621
And Just Let Me
Get Through It.

917
00:46:31,621 --> 00:46:34,257
I'll Be As Silent
As A Monk.

918
00:46:34,257 --> 00:46:36,294
So, What's The Deal?

919
00:46:38,294 --> 00:46:39,696
Come On,
You're A Smart Girl.

920
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:40,530
Think Logically.

921
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:43,700
How Did Those Doves Appear
In Your Van?

922
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,401
How Did Brandon Disappear
From A Stage

923
00:46:45,401 --> 00:46:46,703
That Has No Trapdoor?

924
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:48,404
Nobody's Missing
A Mechanical Bull Anywhere,

925
00:46:48,404 --> 00:46:51,308
But Yet One Totally
Appears On Our Stage?

926
00:46:52,308 --> 00:46:53,476
I Mean, Do You Honestly
Think It's Because

927
00:46:53,476 --> 00:46:55,678
I'm Such A Great Magician?

928
00:46:55,678 --> 00:46:57,581
What Are You Saying?

929
00:46:58,581 --> 00:47:00,283
I Was Serious Before,
All Right?

930
00:47:00,283 --> 00:47:02,553
I'm A Freak.

931
00:47:03,553 --> 00:47:04,654
I'm A Freak.

932
00:47:04,654 --> 00:47:06,589
Your Powers?

933
00:47:06,589 --> 00:47:09,392
Look...

934
00:47:09,392 --> 00:47:12,762
About 3 Years Ago,
I Was Walking To School

935
00:47:12,762 --> 00:47:14,797
And I Saw This
Really Cool Skateboard

936
00:47:14,797 --> 00:47:16,232
In The Store Window.

937
00:47:16,232 --> 00:47:17,467
And I Was Thinking
To Myself

938
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:21,271
How Much
I Wanted That Thing.

939
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:23,239
2 Seconds Later,
It's Under My Feet

940
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:24,607
And I'm Riding It.

941
00:47:24,607 --> 00:47:25,675
It Just Appeared?

942
00:47:25,675 --> 00:47:28,111
No, No.
It Didn't Just Appear.

943
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:29,079
Ok, I Made It Appear.

944
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:31,314
A Couple Months Later,
This Jerk At School Was

945
00:47:31,314 --> 00:47:34,217
Picking On Me,
Making Fun Of My Hair Or My Pants Or Whatever,

946
00:47:34,217 --> 00:47:36,419
And I Was Wishing That
He Would Just Get Lost.

947
00:47:36,419 --> 00:47:39,455
And Then He Was Gone.

948
00:47:39,455 --> 00:47:41,591
Then They Found Him Like 10
Feet Up In An Old Oak Tree

949
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:43,593
Hanging By A Belt Loop.

950
00:47:43,593 --> 00:47:45,828
But How Is Any
Of That Possible?

951
00:47:45,828 --> 00:47:48,431
That's The Point.
I Don't Know.

952
00:47:48,431 --> 00:47:49,632
Ever Since
That First Incident,

953
00:47:49,632 --> 00:47:51,701
I Have Been Driving
Myself Crazy

954
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:54,804
Trying To Figure Out
What's Wrong With Me.

955
00:47:54,804 --> 00:47:56,773
I Can't Control My Magic,
Allyson.

956
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:59,375
I Don't Know How Or When
Things Are Gonna Happen,

957
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:00,910
They Just Do.

958
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:04,147
That Must Be
So Scary For You.

959
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:07,917
Yeah. Yeah, It Is.

960
00:48:07,917 --> 00:48:11,921
It's--

961
00:48:11,921 --> 00:48:14,590
It's Terrifying.

962
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:17,427
That's Why
I Don't Have Any Friends.

963
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:19,462
And That's Why I Can't Get Up
There In Front Of Those Experts.

964
00:48:19,462 --> 00:48:20,630
Either Nothing Will Happen

965
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:22,198
And I'll Look
Like A Total Fraud,

966
00:48:22,198 --> 00:48:23,933
Or My Powers Will Get
Out Of Control

967
00:48:23,933 --> 00:48:26,836
And They'll Recognize
This Great Gift Of Mine

968
00:48:26,836 --> 00:48:29,739
And I'll End Up On Some Government Operating Table

969
00:48:29,739 --> 00:48:33,711
Being Poked And Probed
Like An Alien Lab Rat.

970
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:37,580
Look...

971
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:40,450
I Can't Even Come Close
To Saying I'm Grasping All This,

972
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:46,689
But I Certainly Do Know
How It Feels To Be The Outcast,

973
00:48:46,689 --> 00:48:49,726
The Weirdo,

974
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:52,464
The One Nobody Else Can
Ever Relate To.

975
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:56,700
Not Much Fun, Right?

976
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,836
No, Not So Much.

977
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:03,840
Well, See, That's Why
This Is So Perfect.

978
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,341
Maybe What You Need More
Than Anything Is

979
00:49:05,341 --> 00:49:09,779
Just One Person Who's Really Gonna Believe In You.

980
00:49:09,779 --> 00:49:12,482
And That Person's You?

981
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:14,419
If You Want Me To Be.

982
00:49:16,419 --> 00:49:17,720
Isn't That What
Friends Are For?

983
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,722
Yeah, I Guess.

984
00:49:19,722 --> 00:49:21,457
You Know What Else?

985
00:49:21,457 --> 00:49:24,594
I Think You Should Go
Face Max's Experts.

986
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:25,661
Maybe They Can Help You.

987
00:49:25,661 --> 00:49:29,732
Maybe They Can
Explain All This.

988
00:49:29,732 --> 00:49:32,802
You've Got Nothing
To Lose, Danny.

989
00:49:32,802 --> 00:49:34,837
I Mean, Isn't This Why
You Were So Desperate

990
00:49:34,837 --> 00:49:37,774
To Get Here
In The First Place?

991
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:39,943
To Find The Truth?

992
00:49:40,943 --> 00:49:44,948
These Guys Might Finally Give
You The Answers You Need.

993
00:49:45,948 --> 00:49:47,583
Allyson, NARRATING:
Everything Was Set.

994
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:50,286
Max's Panel Of Experts
Included 2 Scientists

995
00:49:50,286 --> 00:49:53,322
Who Specialized In Explaining
Unexplained Phenomenon.

996
00:49:53,322 --> 00:49:55,591
You Know, The Kind Of Guys
Who Say That Crop Circles

997
00:49:55,591 --> 00:49:57,393
Are Really Made By Kids
Stomping Around

998
00:49:57,393 --> 00:49:58,995
With Cardboard Tied
To Their Shoes,

999
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:01,497
Or That The Loch Ness Monster
Is Nothing But Swamp Gas.

1000
00:50:01,497 --> 00:50:04,600
Oh, And Just So It Wouldn't Be
A Stacked Deck Of Techno-Geeks,

1001
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,336
Max Also Invited
A Self-Proclaimed Psychic,

1002
00:50:07,336 --> 00:50:08,704
Madame Susette.

1003
00:50:08,704 --> 00:50:11,675
And Boy, Does
She Look The Part.

1004
00:50:12,675 --> 00:50:15,645
At What Age Did You
Begin To Notice...

1005
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:18,648
This Ability?

1006
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:20,483
Around 13 Or So.

1007
00:50:20,483 --> 00:50:21,918
It's Common For The Powers
To First Appear

1008
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:23,486
Around The Time Of Puberty.

1009
00:50:23,486 --> 00:50:24,754
Tell Me, Danny,

1010
00:50:24,754 --> 00:50:26,689
Is It Possible
That These Claims

1011
00:50:26,689 --> 00:50:29,625
Of Paranormal Powers Are
Just A Ploy To Get

1012
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:31,594
Some Extra Attention
Around Here?

1013
00:50:31,594 --> 00:50:32,695
No, No.

1014
00:50:32,695 --> 00:50:36,399
My Colleague Is Merely Making
A Reasonable Assumption.

1015
00:50:36,399 --> 00:50:38,501
Anybody Interested In Being
In A Reality Tv Show Is

1016
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:40,870
Obviously Someone
Who Craves A Lot Of Attention.

1017
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:43,739
Danny, Do You Have
A Family History

1018
00:50:43,739 --> 00:50:45,741
Of Paranormal
Abilities?

1019
00:50:45,741 --> 00:50:46,742
Your Mother?

1020
00:50:46,742 --> 00:50:48,742
Your Father?

1021
00:50:46,742 --> 00:50:48,411
No.

1022
00:50:48,411 --> 00:50:50,379
An Aunt Possibly?

1023
00:50:50,379 --> 00:50:51,347
Not That I Know Of.

1024
00:50:51,347 --> 00:50:53,616
Maybe A Long-Lost
Second Cousin Twice Removed

1025
00:50:53,616 --> 00:50:54,617
On Your Father's Side?

1026
00:50:54,617 --> 00:50:58,054
Look, I'm Sure We Could Go On
With This All Day,

1027
00:50:58,054 --> 00:50:59,889
But Either This Boy
Can Demonstrate

1028
00:50:59,889 --> 00:51:02,358
His Supposed Powers
Or He Cannot.

1029
00:51:02,358 --> 00:51:04,727
I, For One,
Am Ready To Find Out.

1030
00:51:04,727 --> 00:51:06,395
What Will You
Be Attempting?

1031
00:51:06,395 --> 00:51:08,798
Yes, Danny, Tell Us.
What's It Going To Be, Hmm?

1032
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:11,534
A Little Localized
Snow Storm Perhaps?

1033
00:51:11,534 --> 00:51:14,604
Maybe A Mechanical Bull
Appearing Out Of Thin Air?

1034
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:16,739
I Honestly Have No Idea.

1035
00:51:16,739 --> 00:51:19,074
Don't Force It, Danny.
Just Relax.

1036
00:51:19,074 --> 00:51:23,679
Clear Your Mind
Of All Thoughts.

1037
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:26,117
Let The Powers
Come To You.

1038
00:51:28,117 --> 00:51:30,386
Are You Up To It, Danny?
Tell Us.

1039
00:51:30,386 --> 00:51:31,897
Are You Up To It Or Not?

1040
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:41,030
Look!

1041
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:42,032
What?

1042
00:51:43,032 --> 00:51:45,032
Do You See This?!

1043
00:51:43,032 --> 00:51:45,836
Whoa!

1044
00:51:46,836 --> 00:51:48,538
Remarkable!

1045
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:51,072
Ok, I'm--
I'm Losing It.

1046
00:51:51,072 --> 00:51:52,783
Relax. Stay Focused.
Breathe.

1047
00:52:00,783 --> 00:52:02,618
What Are You Doing?

1048
00:52:02,618 --> 00:52:03,920
Get Your Hands
Off Of Him.

1049
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,454
Why?
Are You Afraid

1050
00:52:05,454 --> 00:52:07,390
I'm Affecting
His Flight Pattern?

1051
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,525
You Weren't Actually Levitating.
Were You, Danny?

1052
00:52:09,525 --> 00:52:10,027
I Thought I Was.

1053
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:11,027
Of Course He Was.

1054
00:52:12,027 --> 00:52:13,629
Oh, Really?
Well, All Right.

1055
00:52:13,629 --> 00:52:14,931
I Suppose It's Possible,

1056
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:17,867
But Instead Of Going
For Far-Fetched Answers,

1057
00:52:17,867 --> 00:52:19,502
Why Don't We Look At
A More Logical Explanation

1058
00:52:19,502 --> 00:52:21,571
Right In Front Of Us?

1059
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:23,741
Stand Up.
Will You, Danny?

1060
00:52:25,741 --> 00:52:28,177
You See, My Friends,

1061
00:52:28,177 --> 00:52:29,912
The Secret Is
Not In The Boy,

1062
00:52:29,912 --> 00:52:31,079
It's In The Chair.

1063
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:32,748
Please, Explain.

1064
00:52:32,748 --> 00:52:35,685
This Is A Very Clever Device
Invented By

1065
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:38,921
A Scandinavian Illusionist
Named Lars Holmstrom.

1066
00:52:38,921 --> 00:52:41,123
He Made 2 Of Them.
One He Kept For Himself

1067
00:52:41,123 --> 00:52:44,092
And One I Have Here
At The Mansion.

1068
00:52:44,092 --> 00:52:45,895
I Keep It Locked Away
In Storage,

1069
00:52:45,895 --> 00:52:48,898
Although That Could Explain
Why I Received Reports

1070
00:52:48,898 --> 00:52:51,867
Of You Nosing
Around Downstairs.

1071
00:52:51,867 --> 00:52:54,770
I've Never Seen
This Chair Before.

1072
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:55,838
Oh, I See.

1073
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:58,675
I Guess It Walked Up Here
All By Itself, Didn't It?

1074
00:52:59,675 --> 00:53:02,511
I'd Like To Demonstrate For You,
Ladies And Gentlemen.

1075
00:53:02,511 --> 00:53:03,012
There's A Trigger Device
Right Here

1076
00:53:04,012 --> 00:53:04,014
Behind The Left Leg.

1077
00:53:05,014 --> 00:53:06,016
It's A Hydraulic System.

1078
00:53:07,016 --> 00:53:11,021
A Thin Plate Recessed Into The
Chair Seat Is Attached To A Rod

1079
00:53:12,021 --> 00:53:13,756
Which Runs Right Up
The Middle Spine

1080
00:53:13,756 --> 00:53:14,890
Of The Back Of The Chair.

1081
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:18,160
It Is Able
To Lift 200 Pounds.

1082
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:24,003
It's A Very Ingenious Device,
But A Device Nonetheless.

1083
00:53:28,003 --> 00:53:32,475
Danny's A Performer
Like All Performers.

1084
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:35,645
But A Mighty Clever One,
Don't You Think?

1085
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:37,913
Ah.

1086
00:53:37,913 --> 00:53:39,913
Well, Well.

1087
00:53:37,913 --> 00:53:39,852
Interesting.

1088
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:44,654
Danny, Wait.

1089
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:45,988
You Can't Run
Away From Me.

1090
00:53:45,988 --> 00:53:48,056
Whatever You Have To Say,
I Don't Want To Hear It.

1091
00:53:48,056 --> 00:53:49,859
Why? Because You Know
You Lied To Me?

1092
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:51,594
I'm Not A Liar.

1093
00:53:51,594 --> 00:53:53,929
Nobody Can Relate To Me.
My Powers Make Me A Freak.

1094
00:53:53,929 --> 00:53:55,665
I'm So Alone.
Blah, Blah, Blah.

1095
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:57,032
Every Single Bit
Of That Was True.

1096
00:53:57,032 --> 00:53:58,201
Oh, Really?

1097
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:00,269
Because It's Feeling To Me
Like Professor French Was Right.

1098
00:54:00,269 --> 00:54:01,937
You're Only Using Me
To Make Yourself The Star

1099
00:54:01,937 --> 00:54:03,105
Of The Stupid Show.

1100
00:54:03,105 --> 00:54:04,007
Oh, Come On, Allyson,
That Is So Not It!

1101
00:54:05,007 --> 00:54:06,575
Don't You Get It?

1102
00:54:06,575 --> 00:54:08,644
Max Is The One Who Doesn't
Want My Abilities Revealed.

1103
00:54:08,644 --> 00:54:09,912
He's The One
Who Rigged The Chair.

1104
00:54:09,912 --> 00:54:11,912
Care To Tell Me Why?

1105
00:54:09,912 --> 00:54:11,247
I Don't Know!

1106
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:14,850
Maybe There's Some Reason
Why He's Out To Get Me.

1107
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:16,752
You Are--

1108
00:54:16,752 --> 00:54:18,120
You Are Truly Unbelievable.

1109
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,855
You Never Quit, Do You?

1110
00:54:19,855 --> 00:54:23,059
You Actually Had Me Fooled
For A Minute There.

1111
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:24,727
Except Suddenly,
It Couldn't Be Clearer.

1112
00:54:24,727 --> 00:54:26,996
You're Exactly Like Everybody Else I've Ever Known.

1113
00:54:26,996 --> 00:54:28,931
Setting Me Up To Make Me
Look Like A Fool.

1114
00:54:28,931 --> 00:54:30,000
Just So You Can Prove I'm Not
As Smart As I Think I Am!

1115
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,768
Oh, Will You Get
Over Yourself!

1116
00:54:32,768 --> 00:54:33,703
All Right, Did You
Ever Stop To Think

1117
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:35,671
That Maybe This Has Nothing
To Do With You?

1118
00:54:35,671 --> 00:54:40,644
You Know What?
Tell It Someone Who Cares.

1119
00:54:41,644 --> 00:54:44,252
Sorry I Was Ever Lame Enough
To Imagine We Were Friends.

1120
00:54:50,252 --> 00:54:52,021
So, Where Did That Leave Us?

1121
00:54:53,021 --> 00:54:55,691
As Far As The Expert Panel
Was Concerned,

1122
00:54:55,691 --> 00:54:57,027
Danny Was Just
An Ordinary Kid Magician

1123
00:54:58,027 --> 00:55:02,865
Who Also Happened To Be
A Truly Impressive Trickster.

1124
00:55:02,865 --> 00:55:06,068
Well, Much To Hunter's Dismay,

1125
00:55:06,068 --> 00:55:08,804
That Meant Danny Was
Not Only Still Eligible

1126
00:55:08,804 --> 00:55:10,806
To Compete
In The Grand Finale,

1127
00:55:10,806 --> 00:55:15,111
But It Also Meant He Was
Probably A Shoe-In To Win.

1128
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:19,248
And As For Me,
Well, Losing A Friend

1129
00:55:19,248 --> 00:55:22,618
Did Not Mean I Was Willing
To Lose My Job.

1130
00:55:22,618 --> 00:55:24,887
The Big Difference Was
That From Here On Out,

1131
00:55:24,887 --> 00:55:28,056
Danny And I Were Gonna Be
All About The Show

1132
00:55:28,056 --> 00:55:29,069
And Nothing Else.

1133
00:55:40,069 --> 00:55:43,739
Hey, Shouldn't We Be Out
Getting New Footage

1134
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:46,074
Of Danny Practicing
His New Trick Or Something?

1135
00:55:46,074 --> 00:55:48,811
I'd Love To, Cedric,
But I'm Busy.

1136
00:55:48,811 --> 00:55:51,680
Oh, Still Ticked, Huh?

1137
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,282
Don't I Have
A Right To Be?

1138
00:55:53,282 --> 00:55:55,718
I Don't Know If Danny Lied To You
About The Levitation Chair Or What,

1139
00:55:55,718 --> 00:55:57,887
But He's Still
A Great Magician.

1140
00:55:57,887 --> 00:55:59,121
I Mean, If Nothing Else.

1141
00:55:59,121 --> 00:56:02,056
And We Both Know
He Totally Pulled Off

1142
00:56:02,056 --> 00:56:03,859
Getting Those Doves
Into Paul's Van.

1143
00:56:03,859 --> 00:56:05,261
No, He Didn't.

1144
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:07,396
I'm Sure It's Just
One More Lousy Trick.

1145
00:56:07,396 --> 00:56:09,398
I'll Bet You I Can Show You How He Did It.

1146
00:56:09,398 --> 00:56:10,068
Sure.

1147
00:56:13,068 --> 00:56:16,806
Ok, Somewhere In Here
We're Gonna See His Parents

1148
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:19,175
Or Somebody Show Up To Start
Loading Those Doves Into The Van.

1149
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:20,943
How? Paul Locked It
When We Left.

1150
00:56:20,943 --> 00:56:22,845
It Was Still Locked
When We Got Back.

1151
00:56:22,845 --> 00:56:25,347
Maybe We Left A Window
Cracked Or Something.

1152
00:56:25,347 --> 00:56:27,817
I Don't Know.

1153
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:30,219
Hate To Tell You,
But Here We Come,

1154
00:56:30,219 --> 00:56:31,757
And Nobody's Messed
With The Van.

1155
00:56:34,757 --> 00:56:36,358
You're Opening The Door.

1156
00:56:36,358 --> 00:56:38,995
I Still Haven't Seen
Any Dove Wrangler.

1157
00:56:39,995 --> 00:56:41,297
Did You See That?

1158
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:43,737
Back It Up.
Back It Up.

1159
00:56:48,737 --> 00:56:51,807
Those Doves Came
Out Of Nothing.

1160
00:56:51,807 --> 00:56:54,410
Now You See It,
Now You Don't.

1161
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:56,847
It's A Miracle.

1162
00:56:57,847 --> 00:56:58,848
Absolutely.

1163
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:00,216
Ha Ha!

1164
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:01,223
Without A Doubt.

1165
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:10,236
Danny's Not A Magician.
He's A Wizard.

1166
00:57:25,207 --> 00:57:26,942
Danny?

1167
00:57:28,811 --> 00:57:30,214
Danny?

1168
00:57:32,214 --> 00:57:34,921
Danny?

1169
00:57:38,921 --> 00:57:40,492
Come On.

1170
00:57:43,492 --> 00:57:46,099
Cedric, You Check Outside.
I'll Check The Vault.

1171
00:57:58,072 --> 00:58:00,918
Danny?

1172
00:58:14,523 --> 00:58:17,126
Come On, Danny.
Sit Down, Relax.

1173
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:19,495
It's Nothing
To Concern Yourself With.

1174
00:58:19,495 --> 00:58:21,132
You're Sure?

1175
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:25,801
You Came Here Looking
For Answers, Didn't You?

1176
00:58:25,801 --> 00:58:28,070
Isn't That Why
You Entered The Contest?

1177
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:32,207
Well, Yeah.
I Guess.

1178
00:58:32,207 --> 00:58:34,143
I Have Exactly What It Is
You're Looking For.

1179
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:36,981
Sit Down.

1180
00:58:38,981 --> 00:58:42,952
Danny, I Know All About You.

1181
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:45,387
I Know About Your Struggles,
I Know About Your Confusion,

1182
00:58:45,387 --> 00:58:48,090
And I Know
About Your Powers.

1183
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:50,359
But Aren't You The One
Who Said I Was Faking It

1184
00:58:50,359 --> 00:58:53,128
To Get Attention?
I Mean, Aren't You

1185
00:58:53,128 --> 00:58:55,397
The President Of
The Worldwide Skeptic Society?

1186
00:58:55,397 --> 00:58:57,166
It's A Perfect Cover,
Isn't It?

1187
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:59,368
You See, Every Generation

1188
00:58:59,368 --> 00:59:02,404
One Or Two Truly Powerful
Sorcerers Are Born

1189
00:59:02,404 --> 00:59:04,974
With Magical Abilities
That Would Boggle

1190
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:07,076
The Imagination
Of Ordinary Men.

1191
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:09,545
I'm One Of
Those True Wizards.

1192
00:59:09,545 --> 00:59:12,982
And, Danny,

1193
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:14,852
So Are You.

1194
00:59:16,852 --> 00:59:20,823
But How Did You Know?
I Mean, How Did You Find Me?

1195
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:23,826
I Didn't Find You.
You Found Me.

1196
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:26,261
I Created This Show
Hoping It Act As A Lure

1197
00:59:26,261 --> 00:59:28,297
To Bring Out
One More Great Sorcerer,

1198
00:59:28,297 --> 00:59:29,365
And It Worked.

1199
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:33,268
If I'm So Great And Magical,
Then How Come My Powers

1200
00:59:33,268 --> 00:59:34,603
Are Always Totally
Out Of My Control?

1201
00:59:34,603 --> 00:59:38,474
Well, You're Young Yet,
You're Untrained,

1202
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:40,277
But All That's
About To Change.

1203
00:59:42,277 --> 00:59:43,412
What Do You Mean?

1204
00:59:43,412 --> 00:59:46,582
Harnessing Your Power
Is About Focus

1205
00:59:46,582 --> 00:59:48,851
And Concentration.

1206
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:51,220
It's About Learning To Believe
That You Are Entitled

1207
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,521
To This Great Gift
You've Been Given.

1208
00:59:52,521 --> 00:59:54,857
Oh, MY GOSH.

1209
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:56,525
It's Nothing
To Be Afraid Of.

1210
00:59:56,525 --> 00:59:58,260
Danny, I Have Felt
Every Single Thing

1211
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,561
That You've Been Feeling.

1212
00:59:59,561 --> 00:00:02,931
I Was Exactly Like You,

1213
01:00:02,931 --> 01:00:04,633
Alone And Afraid.

1214
01:00:04,633 --> 01:00:09,271
And Then One Day,
I Met My Mentor,

1215
01:00:09,271 --> 01:00:10,873
Antonio De Milo,

1216
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:13,308
And I Began To Feel
What I Know

1217
01:00:13,308 --> 01:00:14,643
You're Going
To Begin To Feel.

1218
01:00:14,643 --> 01:00:17,646
I Felt Safe.
I Felt Home.

1219
01:00:17,646 --> 01:00:19,948
And That's Where
You Are, Danny.

1220
01:00:19,948 --> 01:00:21,658
You're Home.
Watch This.

1221
01:00:29,658 --> 01:00:31,136
Now, You Try.

1222
01:00:41,136 --> 01:00:43,939
You Need To Be
More Centered.

1223
01:00:43,939 --> 01:00:47,276
It's All About Concentration.
It's All About Focus.

1224
01:00:47,276 --> 01:00:49,211
What You Need To Do Is,

1225
01:00:49,211 --> 01:00:51,224
You Need To Believe.

1226
01:01:02,224 --> 01:01:03,559
There.

1227
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:06,328
You See
How Simple That Is?

1228
01:01:06,328 --> 01:01:08,664
All Right Now,

1229
01:01:08,664 --> 01:01:12,279
Let's See What You've Got.

1230
01:01:24,279 --> 01:01:25,280
Come On! Hit Him!

1231
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,284
Come On, Come On!
Get Him!

1232
01:01:29,284 --> 01:01:30,686
Ow! Get Back!

1233
01:01:30,686 --> 01:01:32,121
Ohh!

1234
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:33,490
Get Him!
Come On!

1235
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:36,262
Yaah! Come On!

1236
01:01:40,262 --> 01:01:42,264
Yeah-Ah!
I'm Gonna Get You, Max!

1237
01:01:42,264 --> 01:01:43,000
Ohh!

1238
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,668
Max, I'm So Sorry.
That Thing Could've Killed You.

1239
01:01:46,668 --> 01:01:49,036
It's Fine, Danny.
It's Perfectly Fine.

1240
01:01:49,036 --> 01:01:50,205
We'll Work On It.

1241
01:01:50,205 --> 01:01:51,440
We'll Work On It
Together.

1242
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,474
That's What Mentors
Are For.

1243
01:01:52,474 --> 01:01:55,582
Meanwhile,
I Have A Gift For You.

1244
01:02:00,582 --> 01:02:02,418
Here.

1245
01:02:03,418 --> 01:02:05,420
Slip This Ring
On Your Finger

1246
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:07,990
And While Your Tutelage
Proceeds,

1247
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:10,025
Your Powers Will Remain
Totally In Check.

1248
01:02:11,025 --> 01:02:12,594
There'll Be No More
Unexpected Spells,

1249
01:02:12,594 --> 01:02:14,296
No More Vanishing Friends,

1250
01:02:14,296 --> 01:02:16,598
No More Having To Worry
About Your Every Thought.

1251
01:02:16,598 --> 01:02:18,333
Well, How--I Mean,
How Is That Possible?

1252
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:19,769
Magic.

1253
01:02:20,769 --> 01:02:21,003
Here.

1254
01:02:22,003 --> 01:02:23,676
Go Ahead.

1255
01:02:27,676 --> 01:02:29,379
Feels Good, Doesn't It?

1256
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:32,014
Yeah, You--
You Don't Even Know.

1257
01:02:33,014 --> 01:02:35,050
But--But Are You Sure
It's Gonna Work?

1258
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:37,286
Yes, I'm Sure.

1259
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:39,588
Look, I Know This
Is Overwhelming For You.

1260
01:02:39,588 --> 01:02:40,023
It's An Awful Lot
To Digest,

1261
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:42,324
An Awful Lot To Grasp,

1262
01:02:42,324 --> 01:02:44,459
So I Think You Should
Go Back To Your Room

1263
01:02:44,459 --> 01:02:46,395
And Have
A Good Night's Sleep.

1264
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:47,796
I Want You To Have
The Best Sleep

1265
01:02:47,796 --> 01:02:49,765
You've Ever Had
In Your Life Tonight.

1266
01:02:49,765 --> 01:02:52,668
Thank You, Max.

1267
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:54,668
Good Night.

1268
01:02:59,174 --> 01:03:00,743
Paul.

1269
01:03:01,743 --> 01:03:04,346
Sounded To Me
Like That Went Pretty Well.

1270
01:03:04,346 --> 01:03:06,548
He Clearly Has The Potential To Be More Powerful

1271
01:03:06,548 --> 01:03:07,649
Than I'll Ever Be.

1272
01:03:07,649 --> 01:03:11,820
That's Why It's Imperative
We Keep A Close Eye On Him.

1273
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:14,389
Not That It's A Problem.

1274
01:03:14,389 --> 01:03:17,092
As Long As No One Removes That Ring From His Finger,

1275
01:03:17,092 --> 01:03:19,261
He's No Threat,
Because As You Know,

1276
01:03:19,261 --> 01:03:20,562
He Can't Remove It
Himself.

1277
01:03:20,562 --> 01:03:24,099
And By This Time
Tomorrow,

1278
01:03:24,099 --> 01:03:26,768
His Powers Will Be Mine,

1279
01:03:26,768 --> 01:03:30,187
Just Like Demilo
Before Him.

1280
01:03:45,187 --> 01:03:47,256
Danny, Please Wake Up.
Are You In There?

1281
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:48,323
We Need To Talk.
Please.

1282
01:03:48,323 --> 01:03:49,324
Open Up, Please.

1283
01:03:49,324 --> 01:03:51,262
Allyson.

1284
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:54,563
It's Late.

1285
01:03:54,563 --> 01:03:55,831
Shouldn't You Be In Bed?

1286
01:03:55,831 --> 01:03:58,308
Yeah. Yeah, Sure.

1287
01:04:06,308 --> 01:04:09,711
After A Completely Horrible
Sleepless Night,

1288
01:04:09,711 --> 01:04:11,346
I--I Realized
It Didn't Matter

1289
01:04:11,346 --> 01:04:13,749
How Mad I'd Been At Danny.

1290
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:15,851
Max Was Up To Something,

1291
01:04:15,851 --> 01:04:18,854
Something Terrible,

1292
01:04:18,854 --> 01:04:22,794
And If I Didn't Warn Danny,
Who Would?

1293
01:04:25,794 --> 01:04:27,129
We Need To Talk.

1294
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:28,230
Nice Catch!

1295
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:30,866
Will You Listen To Me?
This Is Serious!

1296
01:04:30,866 --> 01:04:32,834
Max Is Not
Who You Think He Is.

1297
01:04:32,834 --> 01:04:34,703
Yeah, I Know.
It Turns Out That He's The Only One

1298
01:04:34,703 --> 01:04:35,871
That Truly
Understands Me.

1299
01:04:35,871 --> 01:04:38,674
No, Danny, You're Wrong!

1300
01:04:42,711 --> 01:04:44,179
Look,

1301
01:04:44,179 --> 01:04:45,881
It Would Be Better
If We Could Talk Alone, Ok?

1302
01:04:45,881 --> 01:04:47,883
Why? These Guys
Are My Friends.

1303
01:04:47,883 --> 01:04:50,452
I'm Actually Making
Real Friends, Allyson.

1304
01:04:50,452 --> 01:04:51,553
For The First Time
In Forever

1305
01:04:51,553 --> 01:04:54,256
I'm Feeling Like--

1306
01:04:54,256 --> 01:04:55,691
Like A Normal Kid.

1307
01:04:55,691 --> 01:04:57,392
Yeah?

1308
01:04:57,392 --> 01:04:58,327
Well, I Hate
To Break It To You,

1309
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:00,164
But Maybe That Isn't
Who You Were Born To Be.

1310
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:03,866
Hey! What The--

1311
01:05:04,866 --> 01:05:06,301
Wait. You Followed Me?

1312
01:05:06,301 --> 01:05:07,703
No!

1313
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:09,371
I--I Was Looking For You,

1314
01:05:09,371 --> 01:05:11,239
And I Heard Voices Through
The Grate In The Wall.

1315
01:05:11,239 --> 01:05:13,642
I--I Went To Investigate,
Saw You There With Max--

1316
01:05:13,642 --> 01:05:15,277
All Right, Great!
Then You Heard.

1317
01:05:15,277 --> 01:05:17,279
All Right.
This Ring's On Me To Keep My Powers In Check

1318
01:05:17,279 --> 01:05:18,547
Until I'm Able
To Handle 'Em.

1319
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:19,781
But That's Just It!

1320
01:05:19,781 --> 01:05:21,616
After You Left The Chamber,
I Was Still There

1321
01:05:21,616 --> 01:05:22,884
When Paul Came Back,

1322
01:05:22,884 --> 01:05:25,454
And Max Told Him--

1323
01:05:25,454 --> 01:05:27,856
He Said Your Magic's
Too Powerful,

1324
01:05:27,856 --> 01:05:31,293
That You Need
To Be Watched.

1325
01:05:31,293 --> 01:05:33,395
And He Also Said That--

1326
01:05:33,395 --> 01:05:36,698
That As Long As That Ring
Stays On Your Finger...

1327
01:05:36,698 --> 01:05:38,834
Your Powers Are Totally
In His Control.

1328
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:41,603
Oh, Come On, Allyson!

1329
01:05:41,603 --> 01:05:43,338
All Right, That Doesn't
Even Make Any Sense!

1330
01:05:43,338 --> 01:05:44,308
But It's True!

1331
01:05:46,308 --> 01:05:49,418
You Know What?
I Have Proof.

1332
01:05:56,418 --> 01:05:57,789
Come On!

1333
01:06:00,789 --> 01:06:02,591
Ok. Allyson, Good.

1334
01:06:02,591 --> 01:06:04,393
I'm Glad You're Here.
Hello, Danny.

1335
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:06,395
Uh, Shouldn't You Be Getting
Ready For Tonight's Finale?

1336
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:07,863
Uh, Uh, Sure.

1337
01:06:07,863 --> 01:06:10,466
Um, Miss Mcallister?

1338
01:06:11,466 --> 01:06:12,901
Danny And Max
Are Both Real Sorcerers,

1339
01:06:12,901 --> 01:06:14,636
And Max Is Out To Suppress Danny's Powers.

1340
01:06:14,636 --> 01:06:15,636
Allyson.

1341
01:06:14,636 --> 01:06:15,904
I'm Not Kidding!

1342
01:06:15,904 --> 01:06:16,805
I Have It All Here
On This Tape!

1343
01:06:16,805 --> 01:06:18,640
She Has No Idea
What She's Talking About.

1344
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,776
Yes, I Do!
It's All Right Here!

1345
01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:22,811
Then Perhaps
What We Ought To Do

1346
01:06:22,811 --> 01:06:24,749
Is Watch This Tape
Of Yours, Huh?

1347
01:06:27,749 --> 01:06:29,584
What Is This About, Max?

1348
01:06:29,584 --> 01:06:31,696
I Can Assure You,
I Have No Idea.

1349
01:06:41,696 --> 01:06:43,432
Go Ahead.

1350
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:44,733
Show Them.

1351
01:06:44,733 --> 01:06:47,875
Show Them What You're
Really All About, Huh?

1352
01:06:53,875 --> 01:06:55,413
Now You'll See.

1353
01:06:58,413 --> 01:07:00,556
He Clearly Has The...

1354
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:08,824
Well, Now, Um,

1355
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:10,625
What Do We Call This,
Allyson?

1356
01:07:10,625 --> 01:07:12,861
Polar Bear
In A Snowstorm?

1357
01:07:12,861 --> 01:07:15,330
This--This Can't Be.

1358
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:17,933
It Was--It Was Here.
I Know It Was! I--

1359
01:07:17,933 --> 01:07:20,034
I Shot It Myself.

1360
01:07:20,034 --> 01:07:21,603
You Guys...

1361
01:07:21,603 --> 01:07:23,338
Please, You--

1362
01:07:23,338 --> 01:07:25,740
You Have To Believe Me.

1363
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:26,608
Don't--Don't You Get It?

1364
01:07:26,608 --> 01:07:28,610
He--He Messed With It.
He Did Something!

1365
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:30,612
Please,
You Have To Believe Me.

1366
01:07:30,612 --> 01:07:32,647
They're Sorcerers,
Both Of Them!

1367
01:07:32,647 --> 01:07:35,083
Only Danny's Basically Good
And Max Might Be Evil!

1368
01:07:35,083 --> 01:07:37,719
Oh, Yes, Yes, And...

1369
01:07:37,719 --> 01:07:39,488
The Big Bad Wolf
Is Coming

1370
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:41,356
To Blow Our House Down,
Hmm?

1371
01:07:41,356 --> 01:07:42,958
Please, You Have To
Believe Me.

1372
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:43,992
I Know What I Saw
And Heard.

1373
01:07:43,992 --> 01:07:46,461
The Problem
Is You're Confusing Fact

1374
01:07:46,461 --> 01:07:47,629
With Fantasy, Allyson,

1375
01:07:47,629 --> 01:07:49,498
And I Don't Think That's
A Very Good Quality

1376
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:51,566
For A Reality Producer,
Don't You Agree?

1377
01:07:51,566 --> 01:07:54,803
You're Probably Just Overwrought And Overworked.

1378
01:07:54,803 --> 01:07:56,438
We've Been Asking
An Awful Lot

1379
01:07:56,438 --> 01:07:57,739
Of You
Teen Producers.

1380
01:07:57,739 --> 01:08:00,074
The Pressure Was Bound
To Get To One Of You.

1381
01:08:00,074 --> 01:08:02,611
Danny, Please, Tell Her.

1382
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:04,479
D-Danny, Please.

1383
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:05,881
Tell Them What,
Allyson?

1384
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:07,482
I'm Just A Normal
Kid Magician

1385
01:08:07,482 --> 01:08:08,016
Who Happens To Be A Truly Impressive Trickster,

1386
01:08:09,016 --> 01:08:09,016
That's All.

1387
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:14,356
Allyson, I'm So Sorry
That You're Upset,

1388
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:16,625
And I'm Sorry
That You're Misinformed,

1389
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:19,828
But I Do Think That The Very Best Thing For Our Show

1390
01:08:19,828 --> 01:08:22,797
And For Your Own Personal Health And Well-Being

1391
01:08:22,797 --> 01:08:27,502
Is That We--We Send You
Home At Once, Hmm?

1392
01:08:27,502 --> 01:08:29,738
Well, It's Just
To Get A Little Rest.

1393
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:31,141
No, You Can't
Do This To Me!

1394
01:08:33,141 --> 01:08:34,843
Miss Mcallister,
Please, I--

1395
01:08:34,843 --> 01:08:36,745
Allyson, Max Is Right.

1396
01:08:36,745 --> 01:08:39,781
It's Painfully Clear
That You Need To Go, Ok?

1397
01:08:39,781 --> 01:08:41,150
I'm Sorry.

1398
01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:43,798
Wait, She--

1399
01:09:02,069 --> 01:09:04,038
Allyson.

1400
01:09:04,038 --> 01:09:05,173
Allyson, Listen--

1401
01:09:05,173 --> 01:09:06,908
Save It, Ok?

1402
01:09:06,908 --> 01:09:08,910
You Had Your Chance To Speak Up,
And You Didn't.

1403
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:10,478
Speak Up About What?

1404
01:09:10,478 --> 01:09:12,480
All Right, You Said You Had Proof,
But You Didn't.

1405
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,049
You Claim That-- That Max Is Out To Get Me,

1406
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:15,717
But You Don't Know
How Or Why.

1407
01:09:15,717 --> 01:09:17,887
I Mean, How Was I Supposed
To Believe You, Huh?

1408
01:09:18,887 --> 01:09:21,156
Besides,
You Have No Idea

1409
01:09:21,156 --> 01:09:22,991
How Happy
I've Been Lately,

1410
01:09:22,991 --> 01:09:25,126
Feeling Like--

1411
01:09:25,126 --> 01:09:29,631
Like A Normal Kid For The First Time In--In Years.

1412
01:09:29,631 --> 01:09:31,099
I Mean,

1413
01:09:31,099 --> 01:09:33,068
It's The Only Thing
I've Ever Wanted.

1414
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:34,636
That's Interesting,

1415
01:09:34,636 --> 01:09:35,637
'Cause If You Want
My Opinion,

1416
01:09:35,637 --> 01:09:37,772
I Think What You Really
Came Here Searching For

1417
01:09:37,772 --> 01:09:40,909
Was To Find Somebody Who
Could Accept You As You Are

1418
01:09:40,909 --> 01:09:42,481
And Be Your Friend.

1419
01:09:46,481 --> 01:09:47,920
Allyson, Look...

1420
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,087
Allyson!

1421
01:09:53,087 --> 01:09:54,155
Allyson!

1422
01:09:54,155 --> 01:09:56,524
Allyson!

1423
01:09:56,524 --> 01:09:58,493
Wow, Look At This,

1424
01:09:58,493 --> 01:10:00,228
Your Last
Great Trick.

1425
01:10:00,228 --> 01:10:03,119
Managing To Make Your Only Ally Disappear, Huh?

1426
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:27,722
I So Stupidly Thought
Danny And I Were Friends.

1427
01:10:27,722 --> 01:10:30,025
But There Was One Little Thing
That Wouldn't Quit Nagging At Me.

1428
01:10:31,025 --> 01:10:33,029
If Antonio Demilo Had
Founded The Magic Mansion

1429
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:35,897
And Served As Max's Mentor,

1430
01:10:35,897 --> 01:10:37,999
What Had Happened To Him?

1431
01:10:37,999 --> 01:10:40,168
There Was Something
In My Gut

1432
01:10:40,168 --> 01:10:43,037
Telling Me
This Was One Last Puzzle

1433
01:10:43,037 --> 01:10:45,721
Crying Out To Be Solved.

1434
01:10:59,721 --> 01:11:02,524
Demilo's Power Seems
To Have Deserted Him.

1435
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:04,793
A Prop That He Had Worked
With A Thousand Times

1436
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:06,561
Fell On Him
During A Live Performance

1437
01:11:06,561 --> 01:11:09,764
And Crushed His Skull.

1438
01:11:09,764 --> 01:11:11,166
And Then I Saw It,

1439
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:13,268
The Ring That Demilo
Was Wearing,

1440
01:11:13,268 --> 01:11:15,704
The Ring That Drains
A Magician's Power,

1441
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:18,740
The Ring That My Friend
Danny Was Now Wearing,

1442
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:21,277
And I Knew What Was
Going To Happen.

1443
01:11:22,277 --> 01:11:23,645
His Powers
Would Fail Him, Too,

1444
01:11:23,645 --> 01:11:25,919
If I Didn't Get That Ring
Off His Finger.

1445
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:32,654
I Had To Tell Him
Everything I Suspected,

1446
01:11:32,654 --> 01:11:34,889
Everything I Found.

1447
01:11:34,889 --> 01:11:37,058
I Wasn't Sure Exactly
What He Was Up To,

1448
01:11:37,058 --> 01:11:39,794
But If Max Was Now Planning
To Rob Danny Of His Powers

1449
01:11:39,794 --> 01:11:41,029
Or Perhaps
Something Even Worse,

1450
01:11:42,029 --> 01:11:43,631
He'd Have
The Perfect Opportunity

1451
01:11:43,631 --> 01:11:45,800
During The Finale
That Night,

1452
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,803
The Finale That Was
Just About To Start.

1453
01:11:48,803 --> 01:11:50,338
I Was Out Of Time.

1454
01:11:50,338 --> 01:11:54,943
I Had To Get Back Into The Magic
Mansion To Warn My Friend.

1455
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:57,645
Sure. Ok.

1456
01:11:57,645 --> 01:11:58,286
But How?

1457
01:12:15,597 --> 01:12:17,597
Mr. And Mrs. Sinclair.

1458
01:12:15,597 --> 01:12:17,599
Hey.

1459
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:19,167
Welcome.
How Are You?

1460
01:12:19,167 --> 01:12:20,602
It's Very Nice
To See You.

1461
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:21,770
This Is A Big Day
For Danny.

1462
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:22,638
He's Excited.

1463
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:24,205
We Have A Table
Right Up Front For You.

1464
01:12:24,205 --> 01:12:26,205
Thank You.

1465
01:12:24,205 --> 01:12:26,342
Enjoy.

1466
01:12:27,342 --> 01:12:29,042
Hey, You,
Put That Trunk Over Here!

1467
01:12:29,042 --> 01:12:31,679
Hey, I Need That Camera
Out Here Now, Ok?

1468
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:33,081
Just Now. You!

1469
01:12:33,081 --> 01:12:35,350
You! I Need You Covering
Arrivals In The Lobby.

1470
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:39,320
Uh-Huh, Uh-Huh. Yes.
Don't Worry. I'm On It.

1471
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:42,124
I Got A Delivery
For Danny Sinclair!

1472
01:12:43,124 --> 01:12:45,059
Let's Move, People!
We're Live In 10 Minutes!

1473
01:12:45,059 --> 01:12:46,661
A Little More Hustle
Would Be Appreciated!

1474
01:12:46,661 --> 01:12:48,296
Let's Go!

1475
01:12:48,296 --> 01:12:49,798
Hi! Looking Good, Huh?

1476
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:51,199
My Headset, Please.

1477
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,767
Oh. I Just, Uh,

1478
01:12:52,767 --> 01:12:54,202
Figured With Allyson
Booted Off The Show

1479
01:12:54,202 --> 01:12:56,838
You, Uh, Probably Needed
Somebody To Pick Up The Slack.

1480
01:12:56,838 --> 01:12:58,740
All I Need From You
Is To Find Max

1481
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:00,675
And Make Sure Brandon
Is Ready To Go On.

1482
01:13:00,675 --> 01:13:01,810
I Hear He's Freakin' Out

1483
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:03,711
Over Some Sequin Crisis
Or Something.

1484
01:13:03,711 --> 01:13:05,711
No Problem!

1485
01:13:03,711 --> 01:13:05,413
Ok.

1486
01:13:05,413 --> 01:13:07,649
I'm Going On, In Like,
5 Minutes, And Nothing's Ready!

1487
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:09,951
Wardrobe Malfunction,
All The Way!

1488
01:13:09,951 --> 01:13:11,820
I Don't Get It, Max.
How Am I Gonna Do My Final Trick

1489
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,388
If This Ring Keeps
My Powers In Check?

1490
01:13:13,388 --> 01:13:14,389
Don't Worry About It.

1491
01:13:14,389 --> 01:13:16,124
We're In This
Together Now, Danny.

1492
01:13:16,124 --> 01:13:17,692
I'll Be Right There
With You.

1493
01:13:17,692 --> 01:13:18,960
Just Go Out
On That Stage,

1494
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,829
And I'll Make Sure
The Magic Happens.

1495
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:22,063
Isn't That Kind
Of Like Cheating?

1496
01:13:22,063 --> 01:13:23,164
I Mean, Maybe--

1497
01:13:23,164 --> 01:13:24,132
Maybe I Should
Just Take It Off

1498
01:13:24,132 --> 01:13:25,266
Until The Contest
Is Over.

1499
01:13:25,266 --> 01:13:27,268
No.

1500
01:13:27,268 --> 01:13:29,871
Do You Remember How You Felt
Before You Put That Ring On?

1501
01:13:29,871 --> 01:13:31,773
Do You Wanna Feel
That Way Again?

1502
01:13:31,773 --> 01:13:33,408
Danny, I Want You
To Trust Me.

1503
01:13:33,408 --> 01:13:34,809
All You Have To Do

1504
01:13:34,809 --> 01:13:36,744
Is Go Out On That Stage
Tonight,

1505
01:13:36,744 --> 01:13:38,313
Relax, And Have Fun.

1506
01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:39,948
Miss Mcallister Needs You
On Stage, Max.

1507
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:42,684
Yes. I'll Be There
Shortly. Look...

1508
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:44,686
We Can Do Great Things
Together, Danny.

1509
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:46,190
Don't Let Me Down.
I'm Counting On You.

1510
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:51,226
This Jacket's Not Even Buttoned Up Right,
To The Light!

1511
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:53,428
Nothing's Ready,
And I'm Going On In, Like, 5 Minutes!

1512
01:13:53,428 --> 01:13:55,128
Nothing's Ready!
Wardrobe Malfunction!

1513
01:14:27,128 --> 01:14:29,864
Tonight Our Search
Will Come To An End.

1514
01:14:29,864 --> 01:14:32,500
3 Incredible Contestants,

1515
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,903
One Final Challenge.

1516
01:14:34,903 --> 01:14:38,840
Who Will Be The World's
Greatest Kid Magician?

1517
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,375
Currently In First Place,

1518
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:44,145
Please Help Me Welcome
The Brilliant Brandon Ross!

1519
01:15:07,168 --> 01:15:08,168
Keep Your Eye On Him.

1520
01:15:07,168 --> 01:15:08,510
Ok.

1521
01:15:37,231 --> 01:15:38,231
Hey.

1522
01:15:38,232 --> 01:15:39,100
What Are You Doing
Back Here?

1523
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:40,335
I Thought Max Banned
From You This Place.

1524
01:15:40,335 --> 01:15:41,903
He--He Did.

1525
01:15:41,903 --> 01:15:44,138
But I--I Just Couldn't
Stay Away, You Know?

1526
01:15:44,138 --> 01:15:46,107
Me And Magic,
We're Like This.

1527
01:15:46,107 --> 01:15:47,409
Yeah?

1528
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:49,444
Well, Too Bad,
'Cause I Think Security's Gonna Wanna Talk To You.

1529
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:50,512
Oh, Come On, Hunter.

1530
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:52,847
Don't Be A Jerk. I Mean,
If You're Gonna Rat Me Out,

1531
01:15:52,847 --> 01:15:55,249
At Least Let Me Show You A
New Little Trick I Learned First.

1532
01:15:55,249 --> 01:15:56,517
Well, What Kind
Of Trick?

1533
01:15:56,517 --> 01:15:57,019
Oh, It's Simple, Really.

1534
01:15:58,019 --> 01:16:00,357
All I Do Is Make
My Problem Disappear!

1535
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:04,127
Allyson, Get Back Here!
Allyson!

1536
01:16:23,211 --> 01:16:26,848
And Now Please Help Me In
Welcoming Our Second Contestant,

1537
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:30,184
Philadelphia's Own,
Zoe Cunningham!

1538
01:16:35,055 --> 01:16:36,524
Camera One, Get Ready.

1539
01:16:36,524 --> 01:16:38,529
This Should Be Fun.
She's Really Cute.

1540
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:53,007
Hey, Man,

1541
01:16:54,007 --> 01:16:55,143
Have Some Fun Out There,
All Right?

1542
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:57,913
Thank You. Thanks.

1543
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:02,617
Psst!

1544
01:17:02,617 --> 01:17:04,588
Danny!

1545
01:17:07,588 --> 01:17:09,157
Allyson, What Are
You Doing Here?

1546
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:10,491
I've Got Something
I Need To Show You.

1547
01:17:10,491 --> 01:17:13,295
It's About Max's Mentor
Antonio Demilo.

1548
01:17:14,295 --> 01:17:15,295
So?

1549
01:17:14,295 --> 01:17:15,430
So?!

1550
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:18,199
He Died In An Onstage Accident
During A Live Performance

1551
01:17:18,199 --> 01:17:21,269
And Happened To Be Wearing The
Exact Same Ring Max Gave To You,

1552
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:23,438
And You're Seriously Telling Me
That Doesn't Mean Anything?!

1553
01:17:23,438 --> 01:17:24,438
Yeah.

1554
01:17:23,438 --> 01:17:24,506
Danny,

1555
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:26,674
You Didn't Hear Max Down In His Chamber With Paul.

1556
01:17:26,674 --> 01:17:29,277
I Did, And You're
In Real Danger Here!

1557
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:30,478
Allyson,
That's Ridiculous.

1558
01:17:30,478 --> 01:17:33,681
Max Is Controlling
Your Powers With That Ring,

1559
01:17:33,681 --> 01:17:35,983
And I Heard Him Say You Can't
Take It Off By Yourself.

1560
01:17:35,983 --> 01:17:37,485
If You Still Don't Believe Me,
Then Just Take It Off

1561
01:17:37,485 --> 01:17:38,586
And See How Different
You Feel!

1562
01:17:38,586 --> 01:17:40,188
I Don't Want
To Take It Off.

1563
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:41,456
All Right? I Know
How Different I'll Feel.

1564
01:17:41,456 --> 01:17:44,325
I'll Feel Scared
And Isolated

1565
01:17:44,325 --> 01:17:45,993
And Petrified
Of My Own Thoughts.

1566
01:17:45,993 --> 01:17:47,562
All Right?
I've Been There!

1567
01:17:47,562 --> 01:17:49,263
And I'm Not Interested
In Going Back.

1568
01:17:49,263 --> 01:17:51,265
But You Can Learn
To Master All That.

1569
01:17:51,265 --> 01:17:52,235
Danny!

1570
01:17:54,235 --> 01:17:55,303
You're On
In One Minute.

1571
01:17:55,303 --> 01:17:57,441
I'll Be Right There,
Miss Mcallister.

1572
01:18:00,441 --> 01:18:01,509
Please,

1573
01:18:01,509 --> 01:18:02,577
Listen To Me.

1574
01:18:02,577 --> 01:18:04,545
I Really Don't Wanna
See You Get Hurt.

1575
01:18:04,545 --> 01:18:07,482
Look, I Might Not Have
Concrete Proof About Max,

1576
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:09,150
But I Know I'm Right!

1577
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:10,551
He Doesn't Honestly
Care About You,

1578
01:18:10,551 --> 01:18:12,187
And I Do!

1579
01:18:13,187 --> 01:18:14,522
Please, Danny,

1580
01:18:14,522 --> 01:18:17,494
I'm Begging You
To Take A Leap Of Faith.

1581
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:21,061
I Gotta Go, All Right?

1582
01:18:21,061 --> 01:18:23,564
Wait! At Least You Could
Let Me Take Your Ring Off.

1583
01:18:23,564 --> 01:18:25,399
You Might Be Able
To Fight Back If You Need To.

1584
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:28,302
I'm Sorry, Allyson.

1585
01:18:28,302 --> 01:18:29,737
All Right?

1586
01:18:29,737 --> 01:18:31,181
I Won't Do It.

1587
01:18:44,085 --> 01:18:46,154
And Now, Drumroll, Please.

1588
01:18:47,221 --> 01:18:48,489
Help Me Give A Warm Welcome

1589
01:18:48,489 --> 01:18:50,358
To Our Final Contestant,

1590
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:53,628
The One And Only
Danny Sinclair!

1591
01:18:53,628 --> 01:18:55,563
Go, Danny!

1592
01:18:55,563 --> 01:18:56,697
Yeah!

1593
01:18:56,697 --> 01:18:59,267
Come On, Danny!

1594
01:18:59,267 --> 01:19:01,034
Well, Danny,
Here It Is.

1595
01:19:01,034 --> 01:19:04,006
One Last Feat
Of Legerdemain.

1596
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:06,541
How Are You Feeling?

1597
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:07,608
To Be Perfectly Honest,

1598
01:19:07,608 --> 01:19:09,777
Way Too Ready
To Get This Over With.

1599
01:19:09,777 --> 01:19:12,413
Oh, Now, Wait A Minute,
My Friend,

1600
01:19:12,413 --> 01:19:14,248
You Mean To Tell Me

1601
01:19:14,248 --> 01:19:16,018
That A Young,
Skinny Fellow Like You

1602
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:19,587
Is Claiming That He's Able
To Lift That Weight

1603
01:19:19,587 --> 01:19:20,021
All On His Own?

1604
01:19:21,021 --> 01:19:25,693
That's 1,000 Pounds
Of Pure Lead.

1605
01:19:25,693 --> 01:19:26,028
You Mean To Say

1606
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:28,696
That You Dare
To Try To Lift That

1607
01:19:28,696 --> 01:19:31,799
And Raise It
Over Your Head?

1608
01:19:31,799 --> 01:19:33,033
That's The Plan,
Yeah.

1609
01:19:33,033 --> 01:19:34,101
What Do You Think, Folks?

1610
01:19:34,101 --> 01:19:35,203
Is It Possible?

1611
01:19:37,171 --> 01:19:39,106
Are You Ready, Danny?

1612
01:19:39,106 --> 01:19:40,107
Absolutely.

1613
01:19:40,107 --> 01:19:41,074
Well, Let's Get On
With The Show.

1614
01:19:41,074 --> 01:19:43,611
That's What We Came For,
Ladies And Gentlemen.

1615
01:20:04,298 --> 01:20:07,338
Whoa. Wait, Wait.
Hold On, Hold On.

1616
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:11,606
Give It Up!

1617
01:20:18,179 --> 01:20:19,614
Give It Up!

1618
01:20:23,217 --> 01:20:25,761
Go Home!

1619
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:43,816
Come On, Danny!

1620
01:21:03,858 --> 01:21:05,126
Yeah!

1621
01:21:05,126 --> 01:21:06,238
Whoo!

1622
01:21:22,443 --> 01:21:23,578
See That?

1623
01:21:33,554 --> 01:21:35,554
Danny, Look Out!

1624
01:21:35,723 --> 01:21:37,769
Oh, My God! Oh!

1625
01:21:48,769 --> 01:21:49,937
I Can't Get
The Ring Off!

1626
01:21:49,937 --> 01:21:51,672
It's Stuck!

1627
01:21:51,672 --> 01:21:53,574
Please Come Over Here!
I'll Take It Off For You!

1628
01:21:53,574 --> 01:21:55,242
Please!

1629
01:21:55,242 --> 01:21:56,413
Come On!

1630
01:21:59,413 --> 01:22:01,818
Well, Well, Well...

1631
01:22:03,818 --> 01:22:05,686
It Looks Like
We're Going To Need

1632
01:22:05,686 --> 01:22:08,422
A Much Stronger Stage, Eh?

1633
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:12,793
I Can't Imagine What It Is
Danny Intends To Do Next,

1634
01:22:12,793 --> 01:22:15,463
But I Hope He's Not Planning
On Using That Weight Again.

1635
01:22:15,463 --> 01:22:16,531
What Do You Say, Folks?

1636
01:22:16,531 --> 01:22:20,334
Why Don't We Give This Young
Man Another Chance, Eh?

1637
01:22:25,272 --> 01:22:27,408
Is There A Problem, Danny?

1638
01:22:27,408 --> 01:22:29,310
I Said I Know About Demilo And The Ring, Max.

1639
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:30,345
You Tricked Me!

1640
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:31,846
Yes. It's A Pretty Clever
Trick, Don't You Think?

1641
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:33,247
Yeah, Well,
It's Not Gonna Work.

1642
01:22:33,247 --> 01:22:34,315
Well, We'll See.

1643
01:22:34,315 --> 01:22:35,315
Yeah, We'll See.

1644
01:22:34,315 --> 01:22:35,783
Ladies And Gentlemen,

1645
01:22:35,783 --> 01:22:38,452
This Young Man
Is Ready To Work Again.

1646
01:22:38,452 --> 01:22:40,855
Why Don't We Give Him
A Nice Round Of Applause

1647
01:22:40,855 --> 01:22:43,424
So He Can Finish
His Act, Eh?

1648
01:22:51,665 --> 01:22:54,003
It's Your Move, Danny.

1649
01:22:57,003 --> 01:23:00,274
Uh, Special Delivery
For Danny Sinclair?

1650
01:23:00,274 --> 01:23:03,477
Well,
What Could This Be?

1651
01:23:03,477 --> 01:23:06,481
A New Wrinkle
Has Been Added, Eh?

1652
01:23:07,481 --> 01:23:08,590
What Is It?

1653
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:22,496
Well, Uh,
Every Great Magician

1654
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:25,366
Deserves A, Uh,
Beautiful Assistant,

1655
01:23:25,366 --> 01:23:26,400
Don't You--

1656
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,501
Don't You Think, Max?

1657
01:23:27,501 --> 01:23:29,570
Oh, I Don't Know.

1658
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:31,472
It Seems To Me

1659
01:23:31,472 --> 01:23:34,009
That Whenever A New Element
Has Been Added Belatedly,

1660
01:23:35,009 --> 01:23:37,745
It Can Be Quite
A Sticking Point.

1661
01:23:41,482 --> 01:23:43,651
And...

1662
01:23:43,651 --> 01:23:46,287
It Has Been My Experience

1663
01:23:46,287 --> 01:23:50,056
That Not Every Assistant
Is Quite As, Um,

1664
01:23:50,056 --> 01:23:52,326
Sharp As She Might Be.

1665
01:23:52,326 --> 01:23:54,496
Allyson!

1666
01:24:01,335 --> 01:24:03,737
Well, Uh,

1667
01:24:03,737 --> 01:24:05,072
They Do Say
That--That--

1668
01:24:05,072 --> 01:24:07,808
That Good Help Is Hard
To Find These Days.

1669
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:10,744
Well, As Amusing As All Of This Has Been,
Ladies And Gentlemen,

1670
01:24:10,744 --> 01:24:11,011
Particularly For Me,

1671
01:24:12,011 --> 01:24:13,881
Why Don't We Give
Danny A Chance

1672
01:24:13,881 --> 01:24:16,550
To Focus On His Trick?

1673
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:18,051
Right, Right.

1674
01:24:18,051 --> 01:24:19,620
Ladies
And Gentlemen...

1675
01:24:25,493 --> 01:24:26,627
Allyson!

1676
01:24:30,831 --> 01:24:32,700
Aha!

1677
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:36,338
Better Late Than Never.
That's, Uh, My Motto.

1678
01:24:37,338 --> 01:24:39,340
Allyson, What Are
You Doing Here?

1679
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:41,475
I Told You. You Can't
Remove The Ring Yourself.

1680
01:24:41,475 --> 01:24:42,476
Someone Else Has To.

1681
01:24:42,476 --> 01:24:43,310
You Don't Give
Up, Do You?

1682
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:44,812
Not When It's Something
I Care About.

1683
01:24:44,812 --> 01:24:46,812
Well, Be My Guest.

1684
01:24:44,812 --> 01:24:46,391
Oh.

1685
01:24:57,391 --> 01:24:59,927
What Do You Think
You're Doing?

1686
01:24:59,927 --> 01:25:01,529
Oh, Well,
My Final Trick, Max.

1687
01:25:01,529 --> 01:25:04,064
Isn't That What You've
Been Urging Me To Do?

1688
01:25:05,064 --> 01:25:07,601
Ladies And Gentlemen,
Max Has So Graciously

1689
01:25:07,601 --> 01:25:09,637
Agreed To Join Me

1690
01:25:09,637 --> 01:25:11,906
As I Perform
My Final Act.

1691
01:25:13,474 --> 01:25:16,477
You're No Match
For Me, Danny,

1692
01:25:16,477 --> 01:25:18,712
With Or Without
The Ring.

1693
01:25:18,712 --> 01:25:20,881
Your Powers
Will Soon Be Mine.

1694
01:25:20,881 --> 01:25:22,881
Never.

1695
01:25:20,881 --> 01:25:22,850
As You Wish.

1696
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:24,485
Your Move, Max.

1697
01:25:24,485 --> 01:25:26,153
Ladies
And Gentlemen,

1698
01:25:26,153 --> 01:25:28,858
Let's Get On
With This Show.

1699
01:25:30,858 --> 01:25:32,626
Whoa!

1700
01:25:32,626 --> 01:25:35,171
Ohh!

1701
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:54,046
Whoa!

1702
01:26:02,489 --> 01:26:04,191
Danny, The Ring!

1703
01:26:04,191 --> 01:26:06,160
It's The Last Piece
Of The Puzzle!

1704
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:08,531
You've Gotta Use It
Against Max!

1705
01:26:10,531 --> 01:26:11,899
Now It's My Move,
Max!

1706
01:26:11,899 --> 01:26:15,669
Aah!

1707
01:26:17,671 --> 01:26:19,009
Aah!

1708
01:26:24,043 --> 01:26:26,788
What Is This? What?

1709
01:26:39,927 --> 01:26:41,897
That Was Cool!

1710
01:26:43,897 --> 01:26:45,042
Yeah, Danny!

1711
01:26:56,042 --> 01:26:57,811
So, That Was It,

1712
01:26:57,811 --> 01:26:59,613
The Most Incredible
Experience

1713
01:26:59,613 --> 01:27:01,215
Anyone Could've
Ever Imagined,

1714
01:27:01,215 --> 01:27:03,817
And I Was There
To Witness It All.

1715
01:27:03,817 --> 01:27:05,519
Of Course,
Max Must've Gotten Paul

1716
01:27:05,519 --> 01:27:06,687
To Take The Ring
Off For Him,

1717
01:27:06,687 --> 01:27:09,256
Because By The Time We Returned
To The Production Office,

1718
01:27:09,256 --> 01:27:11,959
Every Single
Show Tape Had...

1719
01:27:11,959 --> 01:27:14,194
Mysteriously Disappeared.

1720
01:27:14,194 --> 01:27:15,796
But Then...

1721
01:27:15,796 --> 01:27:18,198
Someone Managed To Make Them
Mysteriously Reappear

1722
01:27:18,198 --> 01:27:20,601
Right Here In My Room.

1723
01:27:20,601 --> 01:27:22,069
I Cut Together
Everything You Just Saw

1724
01:27:22,069 --> 01:27:24,204
Because I Felt Like It
Was Really Important

1725
01:27:24,204 --> 01:27:26,707
For Everyone
To Know The Truth.

1726
01:27:26,707 --> 01:27:27,942
And Danny?

1727
01:27:27,942 --> 01:27:31,278
Well, Once He Realized That Max
Was Still Out There Somewhere,

1728
01:27:31,278 --> 01:27:32,713
He Went Into Hiding,

1729
01:27:32,713 --> 01:27:34,181
Hoping To Hone His Skills

1730
01:27:34,181 --> 01:27:35,649
And Get Real Control
Of His Powers

1731
01:27:35,649 --> 01:27:37,751
Before They Meet Again.

1732
01:27:37,751 --> 01:27:39,753
I Hear He's Definitely
Getting Stronger

1733
01:27:39,753 --> 01:27:42,289
Every Single Day.

1734
01:27:42,289 --> 01:27:43,791
Unfortunately,

1735
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:46,063
Even I'm Not Allowed
To Know Where He's Hiding.

1736
01:27:49,063 --> 01:27:51,799
Ok, So Maybe I Do
Know Where He Is.

1737
01:27:51,799 --> 01:27:54,635
Aah!

1738
01:27:54,635 --> 01:27:56,069
How'd I Get Here?!

1739
01:27:56,069 --> 01:27:57,069
Magic.

1740
01:27:57,938 --> 01:27:59,273
You Know, I Still Don't
Know How You Do That!

1741
01:27:59,273 --> 01:28:01,742
Oh, A Good Magician
Never Reveals The Secrets...

1742
01:28:01,742 --> 01:28:02,876
Of His Tricks.

1743
01:28:04,244 --> 01:28:05,316
