00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:41,773
Ow-ooh!

2
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:51,748
Whoo!

3
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:38,626
¶<i> Would you believe me</i>

4
00:01:38,628 --> 00:01:41,795
¶<i> You're the queen of my heart?</i>

5
00:01:41,797 --> 00:01:45,465
¶<i> Please don't deceive me</i>

6
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:48,668
¶<i> Just ain't the way it seems</i>

7
00:01:49,103 --> 00:01:52,604
¶<i> Can you feel my love buzz?</i>

8
00:01:52,606 --> 00:01:56,307
¶<i> Can you feel my love buzz?</i>

9
00:01:56,309 --> 00:01:59,677
¶<i> Can you feel my love buzz?</i>

10
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:02,346
¶<i> Can you feel my love buzz? ¶</i>

11
00:02:02,348 --> 00:02:03,547
Shit!

12
00:02:28,674 --> 00:02:30,507
Hey, Leland!

13
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,175
What's up, Mr. Dennison?
How you doin'?

14
00:02:33,177 --> 00:02:34,843
Slap me. On time, I'm impressed.

15
00:02:34,845 --> 00:02:37,478
Education.
It's very important to me.

16
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,480
So what'd you do last night?

17
00:02:39,482 --> 00:02:42,349
Nothin'. What's up, Dunc?

18
00:02:42,351 --> 00:02:43,350
Hey, guys. What's up?

19
00:02:43,352 --> 00:02:45,185
What'd you do last night, Eric?

20
00:02:45,187 --> 00:02:46,853
Oh, me? Funny you should ask.

21
00:02:46,855 --> 00:02:49,288
Let me see...
oh, yeah, I got laid.

22
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,423
That's what I did. Oh, really?

23
00:02:51,425 --> 00:02:51,689
Yeah.

24
00:02:51,691 --> 00:02:55,392
I thought your family
got rid of those farm animals.

25
00:02:55,394 --> 00:02:56,292
That's good.

26
00:02:56,294 --> 00:02:59,461
Like I was humping a chicken or
a cow or somethin', not Elena.

27
00:02:59,463 --> 00:03:02,497
That's good. That's really good.
You're a comedian, right?

28
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:03,164
So, Elena, huh?

29
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,799
Oh, did you just
get that open, Dunc? Oh!

30
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:06,566
Dunc. Dick.

31
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:09,569
What's the deal? I thought
you just started dating her.

32
00:03:09,571 --> 00:03:13,205
Well, what can I say, man?
She digs tall, skinny guys.

33
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:14,906
Ah, OK.
It happens for some of us.

34
00:03:14,908 --> 00:03:17,608
Dunc, what the hell
are you doin'? Let's go.

35
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,344
Let's hit it, Dunc.

36
00:03:22,848 --> 00:03:26,583
Come on, guys!
Concentrate. Pull together!

37
00:03:26,585 --> 00:03:27,317
Pull!

38
00:03:32,457 --> 00:03:35,257
OK, let's go! Let's go!

39
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:41,396
That's it, you guys.
Pull it together! Power!

40
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:47,668
Nice. Nice.

41
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,705
You need somebody to talk to.
I'm telling you.

42
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,443
Dude, check that out.

43
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,877
Who or what is that?

44
00:04:05,485 --> 00:04:06,851
She's new.

45
00:04:06,853 --> 00:04:08,285
She must be.

46
00:04:08,287 --> 00:04:11,588
Babes like that
don't grow in Seattle.

47
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:19,328
¶<i> Staring eye to eye</i>

48
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:25,433
¶<i> Then, slowly, me again...</i>

49
00:04:25,435 --> 00:04:27,368
You know her?

50
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,336
¶<i> I am being clear</i>

51
00:04:29,338 --> 00:04:34,407

00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,944
¶<i> I do it all the time</i>

53
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,814
¶<i> I do it all the time</i>

54
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:53,557
¶<i> It tries to interrupt me</i>

55
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:00,796
¶<i> Interrupt my mind</i>

56
00:05:00,798 --> 00:05:04,866

57
00:05:04,868 --> 00:05:05,633
¶<i> In another room...</i>

58
00:05:05,635 --> 00:05:09,903
At least talk to your daughter,
'cause I gotta...

¶<i> You do it all the time</i>

60
00:05:14,342 --> 00:05:17,876

65
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,386
<i>Sister's Rodeo. The biggest
little show in the world.</i>

66
00:05:31,388 --> 00:05:32,320
I look like a total geek.

67
00:05:32,322 --> 00:05:33,954
Hey, Adam, give it a rest,
all right?

68
00:05:33,956 --> 00:05:37,691
I'm checking the weather,
see if they're all the same.

69
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:38,491
Look out the window.

70
00:05:38,493 --> 00:05:41,894
Geek City. Why don't you
just make me a sign?

71
00:05:41,896 --> 00:05:43,762
'Cause you'd lose that, too.

72
00:05:43,764 --> 00:05:48,066
<i>...but also a little bit of
sunshine starting to show up...</i>

73
00:05:48,068 --> 00:05:49,367
Hey!

74
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:52,503
Rain with a chance of more rain.
Let's go. Come on.

75
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,072
Hurry up.

76
00:05:57,075 --> 00:05:58,074
Hands.

77
00:05:58,076 --> 00:05:59,975
Teeth.

78
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:02,344
Keys.

79
00:06:03,814 --> 00:06:07,916
All right, here you go. Wait
for me in the car. Hurry up.

80
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:10,752
Hey, airhead, your inhaler.

81
00:06:13,757 --> 00:06:16,958
You're a boy.
That's why you're so clumsy.

82
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,627
Especially little boys.
They're...

83
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,062
¶<i> Staring eye to eye</i>

84
00:06:22,064 --> 00:06:26,633
¶<i> In a quiet room, you wait...</i>

85
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:29,802
- Where's my book bag?
- In front of you.

86
00:06:29,804 --> 00:06:30,969
Oh.

87
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,907
Whoa. Slow down.
Slow down. Slow down.

88
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:39,542
I'll beat you to the car.

89
00:06:39,544 --> 00:06:42,478
Matt, have you seen
my extra computer battery?

90
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,645
It's in the charger.
Which is...?

91
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:47,649
By the toaster. I need
some money for groceries.

92
00:06:49,552 --> 00:06:50,551
20.

93
00:06:50,553 --> 00:06:51,752
And gas.

94
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:53,754
Where does it all go? Life, Dad.

95
00:06:53,756 --> 00:06:56,957
Life. You know, I used
to have one, you know.

96
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,692
Now you got us, Cliff.

97
00:06:58,694 --> 00:07:00,894
Oh! No videos or Gameboys
for the twins

98
00:07:00,896 --> 00:07:02,862
till they finish their homework.

99
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:06,532
"Cliff."

100
00:07:09,135 --> 00:07:13,670
Hey, you guys. I'll be home
around six, all right?

101
00:07:13,672 --> 00:07:14,804
Yeah, OK.

102
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:17,573
Wait up!

103
00:08:16,031 --> 00:08:18,498
You forgot your book.

104
00:08:20,435 --> 00:08:23,669
All I'm asking is her name.
Talk to me, Matt.

105
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:26,738
I know women. I am here for you.

106
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,572
You know women?

107
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:31,175
Mr. Sensitive. Mr. "Hey, guys,
I just got laid."

108
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:35,746
This crude exterior masks a
very sensitive soul, Matthew.

109
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:38,548
Casey, all right?
Her name is Casey.

110
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:43,185
Casey. That's a good name.
You talk to her yet?

111
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:47,088
You haven't even talked to her?
Matt, advice... talk to her.

112
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,191
'Cause it's, like,
one of those necessary steps.

113
00:08:50,193 --> 00:08:52,526
This cookie's stale.
Look how hard it is.

114
00:08:52,528 --> 00:08:54,861
It's a biscotti, you dumb-dumb.
It's supposed to be hard.

115
00:08:54,863 --> 00:08:57,797
I ought to pop...
Ah, two for flinchin'.

116
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:59,131
Come on, we're gonna
miss the movie.

117
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:03,101
Hey, you guys go ahead without
me, all right? I gotta bail.

118
00:09:03,103 --> 00:09:04,135
Why? Oh, Casey.

119
00:09:04,137 --> 00:09:07,104
What are you gonna do, go over to her
house and stake it out or something?

120
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:10,874
Stake out her house? Right. Maybe
that's how you pick up chicks.

121
00:09:10,876 --> 00:09:14,878
Yeah? So what?
All right, man. Whatever.

122
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,083
Abandoning your friends for some chick you
haven't even talked to yet. Whatever.

123
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:22,585
You boys have fun.

124
00:09:22,587 --> 00:09:23,852
Traitor.

125
00:09:24,654 --> 00:09:26,086
What if I get caught?

126
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:29,089
I won't know.
I'll be outta here.

127
00:09:29,091 --> 00:09:33,726
I'm just joking. Come on. Go do it.
It's not a major crime.

128
00:09:33,728 --> 00:09:35,627
It's a minor crime?

129
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:37,595
It's not a crime.

130
00:09:37,597 --> 00:09:39,129
All right? Come on.

131
00:09:39,131 --> 00:09:41,965
Record's 20 seconds. Hurry up.

132
00:09:47,205 --> 00:09:49,872
Who is this Casey?

133
00:09:50,608 --> 00:09:53,008
Is she your girlfriend?

134
00:09:54,878 --> 00:09:57,678
Are you gonna have sex with her?

135
00:09:58,614 --> 00:09:59,946
What do you know about sex?

136
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:03,549
Enough. You're
changing the subject.

137
00:10:03,551 --> 00:10:04,049
Did it!

138
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:06,985
Good job, Superman.
Tear any muscles?

139
00:10:06,987 --> 00:10:08,853
No! Shut up!

140
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:09,687
You!

141
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:10,954
You! Shut up!

142
00:10:10,956 --> 00:10:12,155
Why don't you? Shut up!

143
00:10:12,157 --> 00:10:13,122
You! You!

144
00:10:13,124 --> 00:10:14,656
Shh! Get down!

145
00:10:14,658 --> 00:10:15,857
Shut up!

You! You!

147

You! You!

You! You!

149
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:26,565
Stay down. Come on.

150
00:10:39,313 --> 00:10:41,012
Hey. Hi.

151
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:20,283
Got two, man.

152
00:11:24,122 --> 00:11:27,656
Hey, you got the time?

153
00:11:27,658 --> 00:11:28,356
Thanks.

154
00:11:28,358 --> 00:11:31,625
Hey, wait up, man!

155
00:11:31,627 --> 00:11:33,259
Ahem.

156
00:11:33,261 --> 00:11:35,794
What a coincidence.

157
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:38,196
Why didn't you just ask me?

158
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,163
You know.

159
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,199
In case I said no.

160
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,167
I guess.

161
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,401
What's your name?

162
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,102
Matt... Leland.

163
00:11:46,104 --> 00:11:50,339
Well, I'm Casey, but somehow
you already seem to know that.

164
00:11:51,141 --> 00:11:55,343
Look, if you want to go on a date,
you're gonna have to ask me.

165
00:11:57,347 --> 00:12:00,014
Excuse me. Excuse me.

166
00:12:00,016 --> 00:12:02,182
Come on.

167
00:12:02,184 --> 00:12:03,449
Casey!

168
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,285
Casey!

169
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:12,757
Casey. Hey, would you
wait a minute, please?

170
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:14,191
What?

171
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,359
I feel like an idiot.

172
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,294
You look like an idiot.

173
00:12:18,296 --> 00:12:20,896
I am an idiot, all right? Uh...

174
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,399
Would you go out with me?

175
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:29,437
I want it! Give it to me!
I love it!

176
00:12:32,074 --> 00:12:35,075
¶<i> Don't give it to her,</i>

¶<i> Give it to me, I love it</i>

179
00:12:43,851 --> 00:12:47,285
¶<i> I love it, give it to me</i>

180
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:54,325
¶<i> So maybe I didn't</i>
<i>see you first</i>

181
00:12:54,327 --> 00:12:56,327
¶<i> But I know what and who I want</i>

182
00:12:56,329 --> 00:12:58,295
¶<i> I don't even know</i>
<i>what I want yet</i>

183
00:12:58,297 --> 00:12:59,929
¶<i> But I know I want somethin'</i>

184
00:12:59,931 --> 00:13:01,330
¶<i> I don't even know</i>
<i>what I'm missin'</i>

185
00:13:01,332 --> 00:13:04,266
¶<i> Yet I know</i>
<i>I'm missin' somethin'...</i>

186
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:08,936
¶<i> I want it</i>

187
00:13:08,938 --> 00:13:12,205
¶<i> Give it to me, I love it</i>

188
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:15,107
¶<i> Don't give it to her</i>

189
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:16,875
¶<i> You've gotta give it to me.</i>

190
00:13:16,877 --> 00:13:20,245
Me! Me! Me!

191
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:23,381
Me! Me! Me!

192
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:30,421
¶<i> Yeah, I want to know</i>
<i>who to share</i>

193
00:13:30,423 --> 00:13:33,824
¶<i> I'm surprised</i>
<i>that I should dare</i>

194
00:13:39,364 --> 00:13:41,263
¶<i> Well, I'm a bitch,</i>
<i>and you got the itch</i>

195
00:13:41,265 --> 00:13:42,464
¶<i> And sorry to say,</i>
<i>you're finished</i>

196
00:13:42,466 --> 00:13:44,899
¶<i> Yeah, I'm the bitch,</i>
<i>and you got the itch</i>

197
00:13:44,901 --> 00:13:46,800
¶<i> And sorry to say, go fish</i>

198
00:13:46,802 --> 00:13:50,503
¶<i> He didn't have it,</i>
<i>he didn't have it</i>

199
00:13:53,574 --> 00:13:57,909
¶<i> Well, I will have my cake</i>
<i>and I will...</i>

200
00:13:57,911 --> 00:13:58,843
Yeah!

201
00:13:58,845 --> 00:14:01,145
¶<i> Just like you</i>

202
00:14:05,017 --> 00:14:09,886
¶<i> You better watch out</i>
<i>what you're wishing for</i>

203
00:14:13,124 --> 00:14:18,293
¶<i> I will have my cake,</i>
<i>and I will eat it, too</i>

204
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:19,961
¶<i> Just like you! ¶</i>

205
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:25,866
So when it's not raining in this lousy
town, what do you do with yourself?

206
00:14:25,868 --> 00:14:26,566
Hang out. Usual stuff.

207
00:14:26,568 --> 00:14:31,971
Mm-hmm. Hang out. Rob convenience
stores, roll doobies.

208
00:14:31,973 --> 00:14:33,038
Yeah, like that.

209
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,439
Yeah, like that.

210
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:37,942
Do you ever notice that no one
uses their car horns here?

211
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:42,179
I mean, like, in Chicago,
it's a goddamn symphony.

212
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,980
You like rudeness, huh?

213
00:14:43,982 --> 00:14:46,048
Yeah, I like rudeness.

214
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,251
Noise. Honesty. Danger.

215
00:14:49,253 --> 00:14:55,423
So, if Chicago's got so much,
rudeness, honesty and danger,

216
00:14:55,425 --> 00:14:56,257
why'd you leave?

217
00:14:56,259 --> 00:14:58,225
Well, my dad got a job
over at UW.

218
00:14:58,227 --> 00:15:00,360
He's an art professor, but...

219
00:15:00,362 --> 00:15:04,864
he wouldn't know a Caravaggio
if it was shoved up his ass.

220
00:15:04,866 --> 00:15:08,234
You've got a charming way
of turning a phrase.

221
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:11,637
Yeah, well, it was a gift
I was born with.

222
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:16,174
So what about you?
Your family. Details.

223
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:18,575
Uh, well, my Dad's
an exec over at Boeing.

224
00:15:18,577 --> 00:15:21,110
And I've got a brother
and a sister.

225
00:15:21,112 --> 00:15:22,344
They're nine. Twins.

226
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:26,081
Twins. Mmm...
Twins can be tricky.

227
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,283
So what about your mom?
What does she do?

228
00:15:28,285 --> 00:15:32,053
Nothing. What's the
fascination with twins?

229
00:15:32,055 --> 00:15:37,458
Well, I've read a lot,
and I'm a triplet, actually.

230
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,293
Really, a triplet? Oh. Yeah.

231
00:15:39,295 --> 00:15:42,129
Well, nobody else knows but me.

232
00:15:42,131 --> 00:15:42,562
Well, and me.

233
00:15:42,564 --> 00:15:45,965
So I guess it would be our,
you know, little secret.

234
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:46,231
Right.

235
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:50,201
Are there any other... secrets
you want to tell me about?

236
00:15:50,203 --> 00:15:52,102
This one, that one.

237
00:15:52,104 --> 00:15:52,936
OK.

238
00:15:55,974 --> 00:15:57,606
How'd you get that?

239
00:15:57,608 --> 00:16:02,043
Horsing around
with my little brother.

240
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:05,079
You know, families.

241
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:09,282
Shit, look at the time.
I gotta go.

242
00:16:09,284 --> 00:16:10,516
It's still early.

243
00:16:10,518 --> 00:16:12,651
I know, but I've got
a bunch of stuff to do.

244
00:16:12,653 --> 00:16:19,157
Thank you for the ticket and
the concert and... everything.

245
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:23,227
Call me sometime.

246
00:16:25,297 --> 00:16:26,996
OK.

247
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:47,382
You could blow up the school, if you
came up with the right formula.

248
00:16:47,384 --> 00:16:51,386
Why don't you just worry about
passing the class, all right?

249
00:16:51,388 --> 00:16:54,622
Einstein got D's in high school.

250
00:16:54,624 --> 00:16:55,155
What?

251
00:16:55,157 --> 00:16:58,024
Einstein. He got D's
in high school.

252
00:16:58,026 --> 00:16:58,691
So?

253
00:16:58,693 --> 00:17:00,225
Well, it's...

254
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:03,127
Matt, come out and play.

255
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:05,129
I think I gotta
go to the bathroom.

256
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:08,732
Oh, wow. Hey, Teach,
Matt has to pee. Whoo!

257
00:17:08,734 --> 00:17:12,736
I have some free study time.
What are you doing?

258
00:17:12,738 --> 00:17:15,071
Well, specifically? Yeah.

259
00:17:15,073 --> 00:17:16,138
I am doing an experiment

260
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,707
involving the solubility
of sodium chloride.

261
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:23,011
Mm, salt. It's soluble.
Let's go somewhere.

262
00:17:23,013 --> 00:17:23,544
Now? Yeah.

263
00:17:23,546 --> 00:17:24,711
I didn't say anything!

264
00:17:24,713 --> 00:17:28,281
This is a closed campus.
We're not supposed to be...

265
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:28,981
Hey!

266
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:31,249
...leaving during school hours.

267
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:33,317
Oh, yeah, well...

268
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,152
it's a beautiful day.

269
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:38,455
We make our own rules. Come on.

270
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:39,756
Oh, nice parking place.

271
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:44,026
Yeah, well, I pulled it up
just for you. So get in.

272
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:47,396
Well, I guess I could
do my experiment, uh...

273
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:48,296
Later.

274
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:49,463
OK. Sounds good.

275
00:17:52,768 --> 00:17:55,602

00:17:55,604 --> 00:17:58,471

278
00:18:02,576 --> 00:18:06,144

00:18:06,146 --> 00:18:09,380

00:18:12,184 --> 00:18:14,617

288
00:18:33,668 --> 00:18:36,368
Matt, I have a question.

289
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:40,605
If you had the choice to know when you
were going to die or not to know,

290
00:18:40,607 --> 00:18:42,073
what would you choose?

291
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:44,408
¶<i> Let's go for a ride...</i>

292
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:48,645
You don't have anything, uh, immediate
and specific planned here, do you?

293
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:53,416
No. I'm being serious.
What would you choose?

294
00:18:53,418 --> 00:18:56,252
¶<i> Let's go a ride...</i>

295
00:18:56,254 --> 00:18:58,120
Uh...

296
00:18:58,122 --> 00:18:59,354
not to know, I guess.

297
00:18:59,356 --> 00:19:02,256
¶<i> Let's go for a ride...</i>

298
00:19:02,258 --> 00:19:03,423
Why?

299
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:05,124
Because then you'd
always be aware of it.

300
00:19:05,126 --> 00:19:08,627
I mean, that day
just kind of waiting for you.

301
00:19:08,629 --> 00:19:10,762
¶<i> Let's go for a ride</i>

302
00:19:10,764 --> 00:19:13,297
¶<i> Let's go for a ride</i>

303
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:14,431
I'd want to know.

¶<i> Go for a ride...</i>

305
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:18,701
Do you have any idea
where you're going right now?

306
00:19:18,703 --> 00:19:21,270
Not a clue.

307
00:19:21,272 --> 00:19:23,405
Do you want me
to make a suggestion?

308
00:19:23,407 --> 00:19:24,105
Yeah.

309
00:19:24,107 --> 00:19:27,441
¶<i> Let's go for a ride</i>

310
00:19:27,443 --> 00:19:30,811
¶<i> Go for a ride ¶</i>

311
00:19:40,756 --> 00:19:42,255
I like it here.

312
00:19:42,257 --> 00:19:46,359
Yeah. I used to come here
when I was a kid.

313
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:48,194
Long time ago.

314
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:48,694
Yeah.

315
00:19:48,696 --> 00:19:54,800
Well, now I'll be your new memory of
this place, and you'll be my first.

316
00:20:11,652 --> 00:20:13,218
Wow.

317
00:20:17,123 --> 00:20:18,722
Whoo! Oh!

318
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:42,610
I made you some hot chocolate.
OK.

319
00:20:52,154 --> 00:20:54,521
I like your home.

320
00:20:54,523 --> 00:20:57,323
It's, uh, nice and lived in.

321
00:20:57,325 --> 00:20:59,325
My prison since I was a kid.

322
00:20:59,327 --> 00:21:02,528
Oh, yeah, I'm sure you were one
of those little smart-ass kids

323
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,431
who got straight A's
and won all the spelling bees.

324
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,466
Yeah, yeah,
you got me figured out.

325
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:11,635
What about you, though?
Tell me about you.

326
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,371
Well, you know,
what do you think you know?

327
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:18,508
Well, number one, you answer
questions with questions.

328
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:24,413
Uh, you know a little bit about
Volkswagen Beetle engines. Go on.

329
00:21:24,415 --> 00:21:26,348
You don't give a shit
about school.

330
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:34,350
Uh, you like rude people. And
car horns and noise and danger.

331
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:36,524
And?

332
00:21:36,526 --> 00:21:41,428
That's it?
You're not gonna offer anything?

333
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:44,898
I'm here.

334
00:21:46,902 --> 00:21:49,035
All righty. Uh...

335
00:21:50,438 --> 00:21:53,305
...you like butterflies.

336
00:21:53,307 --> 00:21:59,644
Uh, you like books. Not just reading
books, but books themselves.

337
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:05,082
Uh, you know that I like you.

338
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:09,085
How do I know that?

339
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,666
Hey, get the key in the lock.

340
00:22:24,668 --> 00:22:27,001
That's the twins. Come here.

341
00:22:27,003 --> 00:22:29,036
Change in my room. Come on.

342
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:31,638
It's just on the right. OK.

343
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,741
Here, go back there.
Just go right.

344
00:22:36,878 --> 00:22:38,811
Watch it!
Whose is the Herbie car?

345
00:22:38,813 --> 00:22:42,915
It's a 1600 cc Volkswagen
Beetle, Spam for brains.

346
00:22:42,917 --> 00:22:45,651
Yeah, there's some
useful knowledge for you.

347
00:22:45,653 --> 00:22:48,687
I'm starving. What's to eat?

348
00:22:48,689 --> 00:22:50,622
Hey, I said that first! Nu-uh!

349
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,423
Uh-huh. Uh-uh!

350
00:22:52,425 --> 00:22:53,957
Uh-huh.

351
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:34,762
Matt, there's some
girl on the phone.

352
00:23:34,764 --> 00:23:39,600
And she better be right.
This better be important.

353
00:23:39,602 --> 00:23:41,602
Hello? <i>It's me, Casey.</i>

354
00:23:41,604 --> 00:23:42,569
<i>Go look through your telescope.</i>

355
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:47,974
Dad, could you, uh...
Do you have something to do?

356
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:51,510
Yeah. Sleep.

357
00:23:55,015 --> 00:23:58,116
Look, Casey,
about the telescope...

358
00:23:58,118 --> 00:24:03,588
<i>It's OK, I understand.
Just go. Look.</i>

359
00:24:10,096 --> 00:24:12,629
Can you see me? Yeah.

360
00:24:12,631 --> 00:24:19,502
<i>Take a good long look, because it's
the last one you'll ever have.</i>

361
00:24:19,504 --> 00:24:23,072
Casey!

362
00:24:23,074 --> 00:24:24,907
Casey, wait!

363
00:24:28,112 --> 00:24:29,945
Goddamn it!

364
00:24:29,947 --> 00:24:32,113
Casey!

365
00:24:34,784 --> 00:24:36,483
Could you wait up, please?

366
00:24:36,485 --> 00:24:39,986
Wait. I know you're pissed at me,
all right? You have a reason to be.

367
00:24:39,988 --> 00:24:44,123
You think I lied to you. Actually,
I don't think about it at all.

368
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:49,528
Would you let me explain? Explain.
What a pervert you are?

369
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,732
I look at the stars.
That's what I do.

370
00:24:53,734 --> 00:24:55,033
And one day you appeared to me.

371
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,235
Out of nowhere,
suddenly you were in my life.

372
00:24:57,237 --> 00:25:00,137
God, what a desperate hunk
of romantic bullshit.

373
00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:04,141
You spied on me. Do you have
any idea how that feels?

374
00:25:04,143 --> 00:25:05,041
How do you think I felt?

375
00:25:05,043 --> 00:25:10,146
I mean, if you were me and you
saw you, wouldn't you look?

376
00:25:10,148 --> 00:25:13,182
Listen, that's dumb.
You're damn right it's dumb.

377
00:25:13,184 --> 00:25:15,551
You violated me.
I mean, you saw everything.

378
00:25:15,553 --> 00:25:18,754
My books and the color of my
walls. My bed, my toothpaste!

379
00:25:18,756 --> 00:25:25,060
I didn't see your toothpaste. All
right, I did not see your toothpaste.

380
00:25:26,596 --> 00:25:31,231
What else?
What else did you see?

381
00:25:31,233 --> 00:25:33,733
I saw you, Casey.

382
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,703
What am I gonna do with you?

383
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,274
You must be Matt. Come in.

384
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,643
How you doin'?

385
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,680
Richard?

386
00:25:55,853 --> 00:25:57,285
This is Matt, Casey's friend.

387
00:25:57,287 --> 00:25:59,887
Good to meet you, Matt. Pleased
to meet you, too, sir.

388
00:25:59,889 --> 00:26:02,522
I'll tell Casey you're here.
Call me Richard.

389
00:26:02,524 --> 00:26:07,693
We're not much on formalities
around here. Come on.

390
00:26:08,629 --> 00:26:14,132
So, we're neighbors.
Nothing but a lake between us.

391
00:26:14,134 --> 00:26:17,768
And a beautiful lake
it is, sir. Richard.

392
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,703
Sir Richard. I like that.

393
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:22,839
Would you like anything
to drink? A soda? Beer?

394
00:26:22,841 --> 00:26:25,741
A beer would be great. Hm.

395
00:26:25,743 --> 00:26:30,679
Actually, I'll just take a soda. I'm
more in the mood for a soda, actually.

396
00:26:30,681 --> 00:26:31,846
Very good.

397
00:26:31,848 --> 00:26:36,183
Mom, it's fine. OK. I'm sorry.

398
00:26:36,185 --> 00:26:40,253
He seems like a nice boy. He is.

399
00:26:40,255 --> 00:26:44,323
But Dad's probably down there
giving him the third degree.

400
00:26:44,325 --> 00:26:46,058
Can you keep him off
my back, you know,

401
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,627
if I'm not exactly home on time?

402
00:26:48,629 --> 00:26:53,765
I'll do what I can.
You know how he is.

403
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:56,334
I trust you. You know that.

404
00:26:59,772 --> 00:27:02,739
My beautiful girl.

405
00:27:17,754 --> 00:27:20,020
That's a globular cluster,

406
00:27:20,022 --> 00:27:25,258
where tens of thousands of stars
are held together by gravity.

407
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:25,791
And those?

408
00:27:25,793 --> 00:27:32,898
The constellation of Gemini. The
top two are Castor and Pollux.

409
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,600
They were twins
and Pollux was immortal.

410
00:27:35,602 --> 00:27:41,606
And when Castor died, Pollux asked
the gods if they'd let him die, too.

411
00:27:41,608 --> 00:27:44,108
So the gods turned them
into the stars,

412
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:48,145
so that they could remain up
there, side by side forever.

413
00:27:49,348 --> 00:27:56,786
For eternity. Mm. Mm-hm.

414
00:28:24,949 --> 00:28:28,150
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

415
00:28:29,753 --> 00:28:31,285
I like that. Yeah?

416
00:28:31,287 --> 00:28:33,353
Mm-hm.

417
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,221
Matt!

418
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,895
Matt!

419
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:22,899
Matt!

420
00:29:23,301 --> 00:29:25,734
Matt!

421
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:40,881
Students, stop the exam.
Put down your pencils

422
00:29:40,883 --> 00:29:43,483
and make your way to this exit.

423
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:50,322
Matt! Matt, come here!
Mr. Gallant! Mr. Gallant!

424
00:29:50,324 --> 00:29:53,725
You won't believe this. Casey,
what are you doing here?

425
00:29:53,727 --> 00:29:55,126
SAT's are going on.
What? Did you forget?

426
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:59,230
No, but Carolyn Krieg is signing
books over at Elliot Bay.

427
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:01,265
Come on, we gotta go.
Who is Carolyn Krieg?

428
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:03,300
She's this photographer
that I really, really love.

429
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:09,939
And anyway, I tried to get your attention,
but... so I pulled the fire alarm.

430
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,274
You pulled the alarm? Yeah.

431
00:30:12,276 --> 00:30:15,443
What are you, nuts? Yeah. So?

432
00:30:15,445 --> 00:30:18,379
Casey, we were in the middle
of taking the SAT's.

433
00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:20,381
What the hell are you thinking?

434
00:30:20,383 --> 00:30:23,250
Well, she's really, really
beautiful and I want to meet her.

435
00:30:23,252 --> 00:30:26,152
Can I have your attention, kids?
She's really, really beautiful?

436
00:30:26,154 --> 00:30:29,155
It appears to be a false alarm.

437
00:30:29,157 --> 00:30:32,024
So it means we'll have to
reschedule the test.

438
00:30:32,026 --> 00:30:33,792
Great. Great! Now you can go.

439
00:30:33,794 --> 00:30:36,427
No, Casey, I can't.
Look, this is important.

440
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:39,263
I mean, you're not
the center of the universe.

441
00:30:39,265 --> 00:30:43,367
Well, sometimes I am. I mean,
come on, aren't I? Aren't we?

442
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:45,936
You're Casper and I'm Pollack.

443
00:30:45,938 --> 00:30:49,105
Pollux. Castor and Pollux.
There she is. That's her.

444
00:30:49,107 --> 00:30:54,443
She's that little blonde gal...
No, Casey, I gotta go.

445
00:30:54,445 --> 00:30:56,445
Well, fine then.
I'll go by myself.

446
00:30:56,447 --> 00:30:59,514
Tell her I'll want
to see her in my office.

447
00:31:39,889 --> 00:31:45,559
No! No! No! No! I'm not gonna go away!
I'm not going away!

448
00:32:11,587 --> 00:32:13,587
Casey, wha...

449
00:32:39,181 --> 00:32:41,948
Jesus, Casey, wha...!

450
00:33:15,249 --> 00:33:17,182
Casey!

451
00:33:40,707 --> 00:33:42,673
Come here.

452
00:33:43,442 --> 00:33:46,976
He says you're...
you're a bad influence.

453
00:33:46,978 --> 00:33:50,980
He's gonna send me away
to boarding school.

454
00:33:50,982 --> 00:33:52,648
He can't do that. Here.

455
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:55,350
That was so stupid,
what I did today.

456
00:33:55,352 --> 00:33:57,685
I'm sorry. I just
wanted to be with you.

457
00:33:57,687 --> 00:34:00,254
Oh, God. Oh.

458
00:34:02,091 --> 00:34:05,625
You're all right. You're safe.

459
00:34:08,529 --> 00:34:10,362
I'm scared.

460
00:34:10,364 --> 00:34:17,302
I do these things. And the closer
we get, the more scared I get.

461
00:34:18,538 --> 00:34:21,739
And I try and... destroy it.

462
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:28,712
It's not because I don't care,
it's... it's the opposite.

463
00:34:28,714 --> 00:34:31,014
You understand?

464
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:32,682
Yeah.

465
00:34:34,218 --> 00:34:37,219
You all right? I'm cold.

466
00:34:45,095 --> 00:34:51,165
Here. There you go.
There you go.

467
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:54,168
Here you go.

468
00:35:00,376 --> 00:35:04,044
Is this your mom? Yeah.

469
00:35:04,046 --> 00:35:06,312
She's beautiful.

470
00:35:07,615 --> 00:35:10,015
She left when I was nine.

471
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:20,725
What was it like when she left?

472
00:35:21,127 --> 00:35:22,726
I don't remember.

473
00:35:24,496 --> 00:35:26,062
Try.

474
00:35:34,672 --> 00:35:37,339
One day she didn't
pick me up from school.

475
00:35:37,341 --> 00:35:41,543
So, I, uh, I walked home
in the rain, and...

476
00:35:41,545 --> 00:35:47,282
...our neighbor was there with the twins.
They were just babies.

477
00:35:47,284 --> 00:35:50,685
God, they seemed so scared.

478
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,222
Dad said she didn't love us
enough to stay.

479
00:35:58,794 --> 00:36:01,828
Him. Hm?

480
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:05,231
She didn't love him.

481
00:36:19,614 --> 00:36:21,280
Come here.

482
00:37:59,279 --> 00:37:59,944
Hello.

483
00:37:59,946 --> 00:38:02,246
Casey, it's me.

484
00:38:02,248 --> 00:38:05,616
Hi, um, listen,
it's probably not a good time.

485
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:07,451
I got suspended today... Casey.

486
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:09,286
And nobody's too happy around here.
Casey.

487
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:13,556
May I have the phone?
Give me the phone.

488
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:16,026
Who's this? <i>Uh, Matt Leland.</i>

489
00:38:16,028 --> 00:38:18,862
Matt, Casey's been suspended
from school.

490
00:38:18,864 --> 00:38:20,563
And because of her behavior
last night,

491
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:23,699
we feel it would not be a good
idea for you to see her anymore.

492
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:26,401
She's grounded until further notice.
<i>But sir...</i>

493
00:38:26,403 --> 00:38:29,670
<i>I don't have time to debate about this.
We've made the decision.</i>

494
00:38:29,672 --> 00:38:33,373
<i>And I'd appreciate it if
you wouldn't call here again.</i>

495
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:35,441
<i>OK, Matt?</i>

496
00:39:08,342 --> 00:39:13,745
How you doin'? Is, uh, Casey
here? I'm a friend of hers.

497
00:39:13,747 --> 00:39:13,978
No.

498
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:18,782
Do you, uh, do you know where she
is or when she's gonna be back?

499
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:22,719
Her parents took her
to the hospital.

500
00:39:22,721 --> 00:39:25,788
Is she all right? What happened?

501
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:29,892
What hospital is she at? Do you
know the name of the hospital?

502
00:39:29,894 --> 00:39:32,794
I don't know. I'm sorry.

503
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:37,464
Is there a history?

504
00:39:37,466 --> 00:39:39,065
History?

505
00:39:39,067 --> 00:39:42,701
What kind of history? Maybe
something in the family.

506
00:39:42,703 --> 00:39:46,504
Is there any record of
psychiatric illness?

507
00:39:46,506 --> 00:39:51,108
There could be a clinical condition here.
No, no, no, it's not that.

508
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,477
She does this to get back at us.

509
00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:57,547
No matter where we take her,
it's always the same.

510
00:39:57,549 --> 00:40:00,550
This isn't the first time.

511
00:40:00,818 --> 00:40:02,984
We told you she's
tried this before.

512
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:05,786
She thinks we're trying
to control her.

513
00:40:05,788 --> 00:40:08,021
This is her way of
getting back at us.

514
00:40:08,023 --> 00:40:10,990
Do you know what it's like
living with someone like this?

515
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:13,826
Why does she think
you're trying to control her?

516
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:17,696
Who knows what goes through
her mind?

517
00:40:17,698 --> 00:40:22,634
Because we set limits. Because
we're her parents. I don't know.

518
00:40:22,636 --> 00:40:27,038
It's not that simple, Richard.
Yes, it is.

519
00:40:31,444 --> 00:40:34,111
We've tried everything else.
Hospitalize her.

520
00:40:34,113 --> 00:40:37,848
See if that helps. Maybe it'll
scare some sense into her.

521
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:42,018
I think she's already
terrified, Mr. Roberts.

522
00:40:43,021 --> 00:40:45,021
I love my daughter.

523
00:40:47,892 --> 00:40:53,195
I've tried.
God knows, we've tried.

524
00:40:53,697 --> 00:40:56,531
We just don't know
what to do anymore.

525
00:41:02,972 --> 00:41:06,606
Yes? Hi, I'm here to
see Casey Roberts.

526
00:41:13,681 --> 00:41:14,513
Casey's brother's here.

527
00:41:14,515 --> 00:41:19,117
Uh, there's a young man here
who says he's Casey's brother.

528
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,486
He's not Casey's brother.
Get him outta here.

529
00:41:21,488 --> 00:41:22,920
I'll deal with it, Richard.
I'll deal with it.

530
00:41:22,922 --> 00:41:26,757
Please, have a seat, sir.
We'll take care of it.

531
00:41:26,759 --> 00:41:27,724
Where's Casey? Is she all right?

532
00:41:27,726 --> 00:41:31,060
She's OK. She was admitted
here this morning.

533
00:41:31,062 --> 00:41:32,928
What is this place?

534
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,562
It's an acute psychiatric unit.

535
00:41:34,564 --> 00:41:36,964
We have to keep her here
for a while.

536
00:41:36,966 --> 00:41:39,099
Why?

537
00:41:39,101 --> 00:41:41,768
She tried to kill herself, Matt.

538
00:41:44,072 --> 00:41:48,040
She took an overdose. I found her
in the bathroom, unconscious.

539
00:41:48,042 --> 00:41:49,842
Where is she? Can I see her?

540
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:52,677
This isn't a good time.
Go home, Matt, OK?

541
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:55,046
Well, when is a good time?
I don't know.

542
00:41:55,048 --> 00:41:56,047
How long are you
gonna keep her here?

543
00:41:56,049 --> 00:42:00,951
Right now we're uncertain. Please,
go, Matt. We're all very upset.

544
00:42:00,953 --> 00:42:03,887
And your being here
is not helping things.

545
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:08,758
What do we got?
Personal effects.

546
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,927
OK. Doctor, these belong
to Casey Roberts.

547
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,863
Should I bring them to her?
Leave them in her room.

548
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,765
And I want her kept quiet.
All right.

549
00:42:57,006 --> 00:43:02,676
Casey. I don't want you
to see me like this.

550
00:43:04,813 --> 00:43:07,146
What happened?

551
00:43:07,148 --> 00:43:11,116
My dad wouldn't stop
about sending me away.

552
00:43:11,218 --> 00:43:15,753
And we got in a fight so...

553
00:43:18,924 --> 00:43:23,226
I took some pills
'cause I couldn't sleep.

554
00:43:27,765 --> 00:43:30,565
I didn't mean to do it.

555
00:43:32,602 --> 00:43:36,203
I tried to escape,
but they pinned me down.

556
00:43:36,205 --> 00:43:41,841
They're gonna keep me here
for a long time, I know it.

557
00:43:41,843 --> 00:43:47,646
I can't be here. Locked up.

558
00:43:48,315 --> 00:43:49,714
I know.

559
00:43:51,784 --> 00:43:53,083
I know.

560
00:43:55,353 --> 00:43:58,320
Casey, I'm not supposed to
be in here.

561
00:44:02,659 --> 00:44:05,159
I'm gonna go, all right?

562
00:44:05,161 --> 00:44:09,363
All right? OK.

563
00:44:18,273 --> 00:44:20,740
I'll see you tomorrow.

564
00:44:59,914 --> 00:45:01,346
Where the hell have you been?

565
00:45:01,348 --> 00:45:04,649
You were supposed to pick
the twins up from the pool.

566
00:45:04,651 --> 00:45:07,284
They had to call me at work.

567
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,721
I also get a call
from your vice principal

568
00:45:11,723 --> 00:45:13,889
wondering where you were
for the SAT's today.

569
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:14,923
Did you forget
they got rescheduled?

570
00:45:14,925 --> 00:45:19,394
What does he care? Well, apparently,
he does. I... More than you do.

571
00:45:19,396 --> 00:45:21,362
Dad, I don't need
this right now.

572
00:45:21,364 --> 00:45:22,863
What, "you don't need this?"

573
00:45:22,865 --> 00:45:28,201
This is your future, Matt. This is
the next four years of your life.

574
00:45:28,203 --> 00:45:30,169
What could be more
important than that?

575
00:45:30,171 --> 00:45:32,771
Look, a friend of mine was
in trouble, all right? Who?

576
00:45:32,773 --> 00:45:34,839
Oh, this little girl
you've been running around with?

577
00:45:34,841 --> 00:45:36,440
The one who pulled
the fire alarm?

578
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:40,010
Yeah, I know about her, too.
Some friend.

579
00:45:40,012 --> 00:45:40,910
You don't know anything.

580
00:45:40,912 --> 00:45:44,213
Well, I know that you've
got responsibilities here.

581
00:45:44,215 --> 00:45:45,347
To yourself and to this family.

582
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:48,116
And now you've met this girl and
nothing else seems to matter.

583
00:45:48,118 --> 00:45:52,753
Yeah? Well, it's my life, all right?
No, it's our life!

584
00:45:52,755 --> 00:45:55,388
Here in this house!
It's our life!

585
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:58,758
What the hell's the matter with
you? Do you think I need this?

586
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,726
To get dragged out of work
to pick up two nine-year-olds

587
00:46:00,728 --> 00:46:05,397
who are scared out of their wits? To
find out you're jeopardizing your future

588
00:46:05,399 --> 00:46:06,364
for some delinquent?

589
00:46:06,366 --> 00:46:10,167
You are so friggin' blind,
no wonder she left you!

590
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:15,070
No, she left us, Matt.
Don't fool yourself.

591
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:17,305
She left this whole family.

592
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:24,845
And I deal with it every day of my life.
Dad? Daddy?

593
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,354
Why are you fighting?
It's between Dad and I.

594
00:46:35,356 --> 00:46:37,756
Come on, let's go to bed.

595
00:47:09,256 --> 00:47:11,289
I'm glad you're here.

596
00:47:11,291 --> 00:47:15,459
She's over by the window.
She's feeling pretty low.

597
00:47:21,099 --> 00:47:25,468
Hey, crazy girl. Hey.

598
00:47:27,271 --> 00:47:28,770
Hey.

599
00:47:35,545 --> 00:47:39,313
Everything's gonna be all right.

600
00:47:43,185 --> 00:47:45,418
Peter, it's time for your medication.
I don't want it.

601
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:50,790
Peter, is there a problem? This
is the problem. Get away from me!

602
00:47:52,059 --> 00:47:54,426
Get away from me!

603
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,268
I don't want any more.

604
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:04,469
Remember yesterday?

605
00:48:04,471 --> 00:48:05,470
Do you remember yesterday? What?

606
00:48:05,472 --> 00:48:11,242
You took your medication and you felt
a lot better. Didn't you, Peter.

607
00:48:14,413 --> 00:48:16,179
Get out of here!

608
00:48:16,181 --> 00:48:18,881
Oh, just get away from me!
Get out of here!

609
00:48:18,883 --> 00:48:20,983
I think I'm gonna need
some help over here.

610
00:48:20,985 --> 00:48:24,419
Easy does it. Easy, does it.
Peter.

611
00:48:24,421 --> 00:48:25,987
Peter.

612
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:27,388
Don't anybody touch me.

613
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:30,824
It's gonna be OK.
No one's gonna touch you.

614
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:35,995
All right, stay away!

615
00:48:38,299 --> 00:48:42,868
Stay away from me!
Calm down! Calm down!

616
00:49:03,957 --> 00:49:08,292
You think I'm crazy?
You're asking me?

617
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:27,043
¶<i> Bill! Bill! Bill!</i>
<i>Bill Nye, the Science Guy.</i>

618
00:49:27,045 --> 00:49:29,211
<i>Science rules.</i>

619
00:49:30,314 --> 00:49:32,213
¶<i> Bill Nye, the Science Guy.</i>

620
00:49:32,215 --> 00:49:34,481
It's not like Matt to do
something like this.

621
00:49:34,483 --> 00:49:36,382
He's always been
a responsible boy.

622
00:49:36,384 --> 00:49:41,453
I don't know your son, but he broke my
daughter out of a psychiatric hospital.

623
00:49:41,455 --> 00:49:41,920
Richard.

624
00:49:41,922 --> 00:49:43,922
There's no need to
deceive ourselves here.

625
00:49:43,924 --> 00:49:47,225
This kid has done a stupid
and dangerous thing.

626
00:50:01,407 --> 00:50:04,474
First we gotta find them.

627
00:50:07,412 --> 00:50:09,378
Hello? <i>Joanna, it's me.</i>

628
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:10,245
<i>Don't say anything.</i>

629
00:50:10,247 --> 00:50:14,082
I just want you guys to know
that I'm OK. Tell Dad that.

630
00:50:14,084 --> 00:50:16,551
I'm gonna be gone
for a little while.

631
00:50:16,553 --> 00:50:19,120
Are you coming back?
<i>No, not right away.</i>

632
00:50:19,122 --> 00:50:22,189
Is it him? Is it Matt?

633
00:50:22,191 --> 00:50:22,956
Dad! Daddy!

634
00:50:22,958 --> 00:50:24,157
Is that Adam?
<i>Matt is on the phone!</i>

635
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:26,592
Oh, my God, I think it's them.
Everyone's been crazed, Matt.

636
00:50:26,594 --> 00:50:28,660
That girl's parents
are here and everything.

637
00:50:28,662 --> 00:50:36,662
Tell 'em she's all right, too. All right?
I gotta go, Joanna. All right?

638
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:37,568
OK.

639
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:39,269
I love you. <i>Love you.</i>

640
00:50:39,271 --> 00:50:43,473
You guys take care. <i>OK. Bye.</i>

641
00:50:44,275 --> 00:50:46,642
Yeah, Matt? Matt!

642
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:48,710
He's gone.

643
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,786
Like? I like.

644
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:05,693
Come on. We gotta go.
Done? OK. Bye.

645
00:52:12,895 --> 00:52:17,297
I could get used to this.

646
00:52:17,299 --> 00:52:19,465
$168.

647
00:52:19,467 --> 00:52:20,432
Plus your dad's card.

648
00:52:20,434 --> 00:52:25,236
Aw, he'll cut that off soon. Besides,
they could trace us with that.

649
00:52:25,238 --> 00:52:30,541
Hmm. OK, well, then,
we keep moving.

650
00:52:30,543 --> 00:52:34,811
Well, we gotta stop somewhere.
Why?

651
00:52:34,813 --> 00:52:39,448
Well, uh... OK, you're right.
We need a plan.

652
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:43,218
A plan? Yeah. We need a plan.

653
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:47,722
OK, what's our plan?
Our plan is...

654
00:52:50,493 --> 00:52:51,492
Oh! OK...

655
00:52:51,494 --> 00:52:55,629
The next song that comes on,
if it's western, we go north.

656
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:58,932
If it's rock, we go south.

657
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:03,535
Yes! OK...

658
00:53:03,537 --> 00:53:08,606
If the next song that comes on
is a girl, then we go west,

659
00:53:08,608 --> 00:53:11,408
and if it's a boy, we go east.

660
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:12,909
OK.

661
00:53:14,746 --> 00:53:18,647
That's it. Southwest.

662
00:53:18,649 --> 00:53:20,348
Mexico.

663
00:53:21,484 --> 00:53:22,850
Mexico? Mexico.

664
00:53:22,852 --> 00:53:25,953
Mexico? Mexico. Mexico.

665
00:53:25,955 --> 00:53:28,188
Mexico? Mexico.

666
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:30,223
All right.

667
00:53:56,584 --> 00:53:59,585
This is forever, isn't it?

668
00:54:03,223 --> 00:54:05,823
Yes.

669
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:07,891
This is forever.

670
00:54:28,346 --> 00:54:32,715
Wake up! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

671
00:54:34,919 --> 00:54:36,285
What are you doing?!

672
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:40,322
We're going to Mexico! Wake up!

673
00:54:40,324 --> 00:54:40,989
Whoo!

674
00:54:40,991 --> 00:54:46,260
Come on! It's a new day,
we're going away!

675
00:54:46,262 --> 00:54:50,397
Let's go! Come on!
Come on! Come on! Whoo!

676
00:54:50,399 --> 00:54:52,031
Whoo!

677
00:56:38,538 --> 00:56:39,737
Did you ever play trust me?

678
00:56:39,739 --> 00:56:42,706
You know, when you fall back
and someone catches you?

679
00:56:42,708 --> 00:56:45,375
Not since grade school.

680
00:56:45,377 --> 00:56:49,512
Some kid stepped back
so I never trusted him again.

681
00:56:50,147 --> 00:56:52,981
Well, I got a new one to play.

682
00:56:52,983 --> 00:56:55,016
Really? You want to play?

683
00:56:55,018 --> 00:56:58,052
Uh, how do we play?

684
00:56:58,054 --> 00:57:00,487
Casey, come on! Casey, don't!

685
00:57:00,489 --> 00:57:03,556
Trust me. Turn right. Trust.

686
00:57:03,558 --> 00:57:05,691
Casey, this isn't...
Shh! Trust me, OK?

687
00:57:05,693 --> 00:57:08,160
Just stay straight. Stay straight.
Fuck, Casey, come on!

688
00:57:08,162 --> 00:57:10,862
A little to the right. A little.

689
00:57:10,864 --> 00:57:13,030
How'm I doing? Good.

690
00:57:13,032 --> 00:57:14,798
Good. OK, stay straight.

691
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,733
Stay straight. Stay straight.

692
00:57:16,735 --> 00:57:17,567
I'm doing all right?

693
00:57:17,569 --> 00:57:18,634
Yes, you're doing great.

694
00:57:18,636 --> 00:57:20,502
OK. It's fun, isn't it?

695
00:57:20,504 --> 00:57:23,605
Well, no, but...
that felt good anyway.

696
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:27,642
Left. Left.
OK, right. To the right!

697
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:28,709
Is it clear?

698
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:29,776
Sort of.

699
00:57:29,778 --> 00:57:31,611
Casey, sort of's not good
right now, all right?

700
00:57:31,613 --> 00:57:35,915
OK. OK. It curves to the left.
A little bit. To the left.

701
00:57:35,917 --> 00:57:38,450
Slow down a little bit.

702
00:57:38,452 --> 00:57:41,019
A little bit of brakes.

703
00:57:41,021 --> 00:57:45,123
OK, go left. Easy left. Left.

704
00:57:45,125 --> 00:57:48,926
Oh, go to the right! Shit!

705
00:57:48,928 --> 00:57:49,860
Come on! I'm sorry.

706
00:57:49,862 --> 00:57:52,896
Jesus, Casey!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

707
00:57:52,898 --> 00:57:55,431
OK. Just stay straight then.

708
00:57:55,433 --> 00:57:57,199
Go ahead. Go faster.

709
00:57:57,201 --> 00:57:59,834
OK, go to the left. Good.

710
00:57:59,836 --> 00:58:01,535
Left. Left.

711
00:58:01,537 --> 00:58:04,437
OK, straight. Straight.
Straight. OK, good.

712
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:06,172
Oh, Jesus. OK, good. Good. Good.

713
00:58:06,174 --> 00:58:08,741
Come on! Good. Good. Good.

714
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:12,143
No way! Good.

715
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:18,982
Oh, shit!

716
00:58:18,984 --> 00:58:20,750
Oh, God. Go to the right.

717
00:58:20,752 --> 00:58:24,720
Right, right.
Straight, straight, straight...

718
00:58:24,722 --> 00:58:26,621
OK, steady.

719
00:58:27,991 --> 00:58:29,123
Look.

720
00:58:38,566 --> 00:58:39,698
Oh, shit!

721
00:58:40,834 --> 00:58:42,700
Oh, my God!

722
00:58:42,702 --> 00:58:44,835
Oh, shit! Oh, my God!

723
00:59:02,521 --> 00:59:04,053
Oh, shit. You OK?

724
00:59:04,055 --> 00:59:05,954
Yeah. I, I... You sure?

725
00:59:05,956 --> 00:59:07,789
Yeah, are you OK?

726
00:59:19,736 --> 00:59:21,235
Shit!

727
00:59:32,248 --> 00:59:34,915
Damn it!

728
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:39,151
Shit!

729
00:59:40,154 --> 00:59:42,587
Damn it, the axle's broken.

730
00:59:42,589 --> 00:59:48,659
Stupid game! God, am I an idiot?

731
00:59:48,661 --> 00:59:49,960
It's only a fucking car!

732
00:59:49,962 --> 00:59:53,096
It's a useless friggin'
car now, you know that?

733
00:59:53,098 --> 00:59:57,066
We're hundreds of miles away from home.
What do you think we're gonna do?

734
01:00:00,004 --> 01:00:03,171
Tap our heels three times?

735
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:08,709
I'm glad you're amused by this.

736
01:00:41,844 --> 01:00:44,177
It's called
a forgiveness flower.

737
01:00:44,179 --> 01:00:48,648
Prettiest darn thing you
ever did see, ain't it?

738
01:01:35,229 --> 01:01:38,730
What's going on with you, Casey?

739
01:01:45,739 --> 01:01:49,807
Ooh, outta sight.
Um, hide... OK?

740
01:01:58,984 --> 01:02:03,186
Hi. How you doin'?

741
01:02:05,657 --> 01:02:06,889
Where you headed?

742
01:02:06,891 --> 01:02:08,690
South.

743
01:02:08,692 --> 01:02:11,125
Your lucky day.

744
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:13,127
Great.

745
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:40,821
Oh. Uh...

746
01:02:56,169 --> 01:02:57,801
That's cool.

747
01:03:01,773 --> 01:03:05,107
Got some cigarettes here.
You want one?

748
01:03:05,109 --> 01:03:07,008
Yeah.

749
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:10,337
Aah! Ohh!

750
01:04:16,345 --> 01:04:17,811
Goddamn it!

751
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:21,514
What the hell happened? Dammit!

752
01:04:21,516 --> 01:04:25,217
What's wrong with him? Shit!

753
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:31,089
Get out of the car.
Get the hell out of the car!

754
01:04:31,091 --> 01:04:31,923
Hey!

755
01:04:31,925 --> 01:04:34,225
You fuckin' bitch!

756
01:04:53,279 --> 01:04:56,079
Casey, get in the car!

757
01:04:56,514 --> 01:05:01,049
Where you goin', girl?
Watch it! Casey!

758
01:05:18,064 --> 01:05:22,966
Let me in! Slow down!
Casey, stop!

759
01:05:22,968 --> 01:05:24,534
Stop!

760
01:05:35,446 --> 01:05:37,913
Casey. Casey.

761
01:05:37,915 --> 01:05:39,014
Aah!

762
01:05:39,016 --> 01:05:43,952
Jesus! What the hell are you doin'?
It'll be OK.

763
01:05:43,954 --> 01:05:46,421
It'll be OK.

764
01:05:49,492 --> 01:05:51,992
No!

765
01:05:51,994 --> 01:05:53,226
Damn!

766
01:05:57,932 --> 01:06:00,065
It'll be OK.

767
01:06:00,067 --> 01:06:04,602
It'll be OK. It'll be OK.
It'll be OK.

768
01:07:23,282 --> 01:07:25,115
I'm sorry.

769
01:07:26,051 --> 01:07:30,453
It's all right. I'm OK.

770
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:36,258
We had to do it, right?

771
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:38,226
Come here.

772
01:07:53,376 --> 01:07:54,975
We just called to say
that we're OK.

773
01:07:54,977 --> 01:07:56,676
<i>No, you're not OK, Matt.
Where are you?</i>

774
01:07:56,678 --> 01:07:58,377
Don't worry about it.
<i>Worry about it?</i>

775
01:07:58,379 --> 01:07:59,378
Matt, you gotta get home.

776
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:01,747
If you don't get home, her parents
are gonna call the police.

777
01:08:01,749 --> 01:08:03,482
Don't threaten me, Dad.
<i>I'm not threatening you.</i>

778
01:08:03,484 --> 01:08:05,684
<i>The girl needs help.</i> She's fine, all right?
We're both fine.

779
01:08:05,686 --> 01:08:10,321
<i>No, Matt, she's not fine. She's sick
and she needs psychiatric help.</i>

780
01:08:10,323 --> 01:08:11,455
Matt, you gotta get her
back here.

781
01:08:11,457 --> 01:08:12,656
Tell the twins that I miss 'em,
all right?

782
01:08:12,658 --> 01:08:15,258
<i>Yes, I will tell them, Matt...</i>
Can you do that for me?

783
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:17,660
Don't, Matt. This is more
serious than you think.

784
01:08:17,662 --> 01:08:19,728
Dad, I'm gonna hang up now.
<i>Matt...</i>

785
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:21,696
All right?
<i>Don't hang up. Matt...</i>

786
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:24,598
We're OK. Bye. <i>Matt!</i>

787
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,767
Goddamn it!

788
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,767
I'm really proud of you.

789
01:09:13,146 --> 01:09:17,715
You two look like a nice,
tidy pair. Hi, girls.

790
01:09:17,717 --> 01:09:21,251
Afternoon. You married or what?

791
01:09:21,253 --> 01:09:23,319
Well...
Hey, hey, hey, no problem.

792
01:09:23,321 --> 01:09:26,622
I've been married. I ain't
gonna recommend it to ya.

793
01:09:26,624 --> 01:09:29,191
Watch the railing when we go up.
It might be a little loose.

794
01:09:29,193 --> 01:09:34,863
The phone's over there if you need
it until you get your own, OK?

795
01:09:37,334 --> 01:09:39,167
Thank you.

796
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:42,303
Mm, yes.

797
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,206
Yes.

798
01:09:51,313 --> 01:09:55,815
We'll take it. Is it all right if
we go week by week in the rent?

799
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:58,684
Well, I need a week in advance.

800
01:10:02,823 --> 01:10:04,322
Here you go.

801
01:10:05,658 --> 01:10:07,357
Thanks. And watch the noise.

802
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:12,528
The old lady below you
complains if you blink too loud.

803
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:15,697
We won't blink.
We won't breathe.

804
01:10:20,569 --> 01:10:24,938
You were talking
in your sleep last night.

805
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:27,640
You said your brother's name.

806
01:10:30,478 --> 01:10:32,511
I worry about him.

807
01:10:34,681 --> 01:10:37,348
He's such a...

808
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:39,717
What?

809
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:41,685
A little dork.

810
01:10:43,889 --> 01:10:45,788
Were you a dork?

811
01:10:45,790 --> 01:10:48,423
No.

812
01:10:55,698 --> 01:10:59,533
I've taken you away from them.

813
01:10:59,735 --> 01:11:02,335
You haven't taken me away.

814
01:11:05,239 --> 01:11:07,639
You should leave me...

815
01:11:07,974 --> 01:11:11,709
as punishment for
what I've done to you.

816
01:11:15,381 --> 01:11:18,882
Casey, you've done
everything for me.

817
01:11:22,587 --> 01:11:24,987
All right, fine. $100. OK.

818
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:29,958
I think I can manage that.
Let's get you some money.

819
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,326
OK, great.

820
01:11:34,631 --> 01:11:37,632
OK. Sign here.

821
01:11:39,769 --> 01:11:42,536
20, 40, 60, 80, 90, 100.

822
01:11:42,538 --> 01:11:45,839
There ya go. Thank you very much.
Thank you.

823
01:11:45,841 --> 01:11:48,441
Come back. All right.

824
01:11:51,913 --> 01:11:54,780
All right. Let's go.

825
01:12:04,057 --> 01:12:07,024
Wait here for a minute, will ya?

826
01:12:37,055 --> 01:12:40,089
<i>...believe in Jesus.</i>

827
01:12:40,091 --> 01:12:43,459
<i>Dare, dare to stand up...</i>

828
01:12:44,829 --> 01:12:50,032
<i>So dare to be different.
Dare to stand up for Jesus.</i>

829
01:12:50,034 --> 01:12:53,769
<i>The way is hard, friends...</i>

830
01:12:55,906 --> 01:13:00,441
Look at that little filly.
Hoo, dog. Get a load of her.

831
01:13:00,443 --> 01:13:03,977
I'd stick my spurs
into that any day.

832
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:05,645
Mikey, heads up.

833
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:06,846
Would you look at that? Whoo!

834
01:13:06,848 --> 01:13:10,683
Stop it! Hey! Hey!

835
01:13:10,685 --> 01:13:13,085
Come on. Now, sit down.

836
01:13:13,087 --> 01:13:14,419
No! No!

837
01:13:14,421 --> 01:13:19,957
I said sit down.

838
01:13:19,959 --> 01:13:22,426
Billy. Stop it.

839
01:13:22,428 --> 01:13:26,696
Stop it now! Stop that crying!

840
01:13:26,698 --> 01:13:27,997
Come up here?

841
01:13:27,999 --> 01:13:33,769
All right. Come up here.
You want to sit on my lap?

842
01:13:35,572 --> 01:13:37,438
No, leave me alone.

843
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:40,941
- No, give it to me!
- I said be quiet.

844
01:13:40,943 --> 01:13:44,878
Now, don't make
a fool of yourself.

845
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:33,525
Casey...

846
01:14:33,527 --> 01:14:34,726
Hi.

847
01:14:36,763 --> 01:14:38,195
Um...

848
01:14:38,197 --> 01:14:43,500
I've done that wall and that wall
and that wall and that wall.

849
01:14:43,502 --> 01:14:45,068
Almost done over here.

850
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:48,938
They're for our protection.
They're after us.

851
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:55,876
Do some.

852
01:15:13,996 --> 01:15:16,162
Why aren't you helping me?

853
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:22,767
Why aren't you helping me?

854
01:15:50,261 --> 01:15:53,729
Why is this happening to me?

855
01:16:21,091 --> 01:16:25,259
These look marvelous.

856
01:16:25,261 --> 01:16:28,228
Mmm. Delicious.

857
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:41,006
May I take your order?

858
01:16:41,008 --> 01:16:44,642
Uh, yeah. Um...

859
01:16:44,644 --> 01:16:46,744
Here. The shrimp.

860
01:16:46,746 --> 01:16:48,312
How's that sound, Casey?

861
01:16:48,314 --> 01:16:52,316
That sounds good. OK, we'll
take two of the shrimp.

862
01:16:52,318 --> 01:16:55,552
Two shrimp? Excellent choice.

863
01:16:55,554 --> 01:16:57,654
Thank you.

864
01:17:02,093 --> 01:17:06,128
Look, I got it all figured out,
what we're gonna do.

865
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:07,762
We'll ditch this car we got.

866
01:17:07,764 --> 01:17:10,631
- Try this wine, sweetheart.
- Oh, lovely.

867
01:17:10,633 --> 01:17:14,334
And tomorrow we'll put
a down payment on a new one.

868
01:17:14,336 --> 01:17:17,337
You can choose. OK?

869
01:17:17,339 --> 01:17:20,106
All right? Thank you.

870
01:17:20,108 --> 01:17:21,307
And, uh...

871
01:17:21,309 --> 01:17:26,879
after that we're going to, you
know, stake our claim for Mexico.

872
01:17:27,715 --> 01:17:31,817
It'll be good. And once we get there
we'll just, you know, figure it out.

873
01:17:31,819 --> 01:17:37,689
We'll learn a little Spanish and,
you know, take things as they come.

874
01:17:37,691 --> 01:17:39,157
Make our own rules. Mm.

875
01:17:39,159 --> 01:17:41,893
How's that sound?
That sounds good.

876
01:17:41,895 --> 01:17:44,061
Now, you know that she's old
enough to go away to school.

877
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:45,829
She may be old enough,
but she's not ready.

878
01:17:45,831 --> 01:17:48,832
There's no reason for her
to be staying at home.

879
01:17:48,834 --> 01:17:50,366
What?

880
01:17:50,368 --> 01:17:52,301
I think it's just
the other way around.

881
01:17:52,303 --> 01:17:55,804
You're asking for trouble
when you try to...

882
01:17:55,806 --> 01:18:00,875
Sorry. My dad took me and my mom to a
place like this when I was little,

883
01:18:00,877 --> 01:18:03,844
and I wanted a hamburger,
but they didn't have one

884
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:08,181
and he wanted me to order duck
or some shit like that.

885
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:10,983
I was kicking and screaming,
so Mom said...

886
01:18:13,654 --> 01:18:16,287
..."Don't worry."
And when Dad's steak came,

887
01:18:16,289 --> 01:18:20,224
she cut it up into little pieces and put
it between two slices of bread and said,

888
01:18:20,226 --> 01:18:27,364
"Here. Here's your super deluxe burger."
And it was the best burger I ever ate.

889
01:18:29,234 --> 01:18:30,933
Um, excuse me. Yes?

890
01:18:30,935 --> 01:18:36,638
Can I get another light off you?
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

891
01:18:41,111 --> 01:18:42,743
Thank you. You're welcome.

892
01:18:42,745 --> 01:18:45,178
Anyway, it was really good.

893
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:48,814
And Mom knew how to
do things like that.

894
01:18:48,816 --> 01:18:52,117
On the ride home,
Dad was so pissed.

895
01:19:01,895 --> 01:19:04,896
Do you know where
there's a bathroom here?

896
01:19:09,269 --> 01:19:11,068
It's back here.

897
01:19:12,805 --> 01:19:14,938
Excuse me.

898
01:19:25,317 --> 01:19:30,386
Here's some salad to get you started.
Thanks.

899
01:19:36,994 --> 01:19:40,862
Casey?

900
01:19:56,746 --> 01:20:00,214
Come here. Come here.

901
01:20:00,216 --> 01:20:04,751
Come here.

902
01:20:14,129 --> 01:20:16,729
- Is she all right?
- No, she's not all right.

903
01:20:16,731 --> 01:20:20,332
She was banging on the walls.
She was screaming.

904
01:20:20,334 --> 01:20:22,200
She's hysterical.

905
01:20:24,804 --> 01:20:26,436
My goodness.

906
01:21:16,953 --> 01:21:19,353
<i>Hello?</i> Mrs. Roberts.

907
01:21:19,355 --> 01:21:22,389
This is Matt. Matt Leland.

908
01:21:22,391 --> 01:21:25,492
Oh, thank God. Where are you?
How's Casey?

909
01:21:25,494 --> 01:21:28,528
Who is it? Where is she?
Matt, talk to me.

910
01:21:28,530 --> 01:21:31,397
<i>Is she OK?</i> No.

911
01:21:31,399 --> 01:21:36,468
I mean, she's not hurt oranything, but
something's wrong with her, isn't it?

912
01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:38,570
<i>Yes, yes, she's
clinically depressed.</i>

913
01:21:38,572 --> 01:21:43,207
She needs treatment. She needs
drugs to control her mood swings.

914
01:21:43,209 --> 01:21:44,274
Where can I get the drugs?

915
01:21:44,276 --> 01:21:47,277
<i>It's not so simple. They
have to monitor the dosage.</i>

916
01:21:47,279 --> 01:21:49,045
It can be dangerous.
Now, we need her here.

917
01:21:49,047 --> 01:21:55,184
<i>Please, Matt, they can help her. Just
bring her back and let them try. Please.</i>

918
01:21:55,186 --> 01:21:57,319
No. They're just gonna
lock her up again.

919
01:21:57,321 --> 01:22:01,122
No, no, that won't happen again.
Not like that, I promise.

920
01:22:01,124 --> 01:22:02,156
She can be a voluntary patient.

921
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:06,593
<i>She won't get through this alone, Matt.
I know you're with her now, I know.</i>

922
01:22:06,595 --> 01:22:12,131
But you're scared. Something happened to
scare you to make you call me, right?

923
01:22:12,133 --> 01:22:12,998
<i>Right?</i> Yeah.

924
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:18,403
<i>Right, well, it will happen again. It wasn't
the first time she's attempted suicide.</i>

925
01:22:18,405 --> 01:22:22,039
Now we have got to
work together to help her.

926
01:22:22,041 --> 01:22:24,007
And I want you to be
part of things, OK?

927
01:22:24,009 --> 01:22:28,077
What about Mr. Roberts?
<i>No, you're talking to me now.</i>

928
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:30,012
<i>OK? You'll lose her to the
sickness sooner or later.</i>

929
01:22:30,014 --> 01:22:33,882
Now just tell us where you are,
and we will come and get you, OK?

930
01:22:33,884 --> 01:22:37,418
No. Matt, OK, please?

931
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:39,386
<i>Matt...</i>

932
01:22:39,388 --> 01:22:43,890
No. No, I can't.

933
01:23:48,020 --> 01:23:51,221
Hey! Hey! Hey!

934
01:24:03,368 --> 01:24:05,601
Casey!

935
01:25:11,568 --> 01:25:13,100
Casey.

936
01:25:13,102 --> 01:25:15,402
Go away, Matt.

937
01:25:15,404 --> 01:25:19,272
I don't want you here.
I've made my decision.

938
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:23,775
Casey, you're just scared,
all right?

939
01:25:23,777 --> 01:25:25,877
Just like I'm scared.

940
01:25:25,879 --> 01:25:28,546
I'm not scared.

941
01:25:29,348 --> 01:25:31,848
What the hell are you doing?

942
01:25:31,850 --> 01:25:35,184
Why did you call them?

943
01:25:35,486 --> 01:25:39,855
They don't know where we are.
All right?

944
01:25:39,857 --> 01:25:44,326
I didn't know what else to do!
I... I'm sorry.

945
01:25:44,328 --> 01:25:46,461
No, I'm sorry.

946
01:25:48,131 --> 01:25:51,832
For everything I've done to you.

947
01:25:53,168 --> 01:25:53,900
That is bullshit, Casey.

948
01:25:53,902 --> 01:25:57,837
I don't want to be sick anymore, OK?
You don't have to.

949
01:25:57,839 --> 01:25:59,839
I don't wanna live like this!

950
01:25:59,841 --> 01:26:01,907
You don't have to!

951
01:26:02,509 --> 01:26:03,808
They'll lock me up! No!

952
01:26:03,810 --> 01:26:08,212
I'm not gonna let 'em, all right?
But you can't do this by yourself!

953
01:26:08,214 --> 01:26:11,181
Neither can I, all right?
I tried! I can't do it!

954
01:26:11,183 --> 01:26:14,884
Well, then go, OK? If it's
too much for you to handle.

955
01:26:14,886 --> 01:26:18,754
I can handle it, all right?
I mean, I'm here, aren't I?

956
01:26:18,756 --> 01:26:22,457
I'm here right now!
I'm not leavin'!

957
01:26:25,395 --> 01:26:27,695
OK, stay.

958
01:26:46,815 --> 01:26:47,747
Oh, that's great, Casey!

959
01:26:47,749 --> 01:26:51,584
Just go and throw away
everything we got, all right?

960
01:26:55,923 --> 01:26:59,858
And kill me while you're at it,
why don't you?

961
01:26:59,860 --> 01:27:02,827
Casey, what are you waiting for?

962
01:27:06,365 --> 01:27:09,366
Go on, shoot me!

963
01:27:09,701 --> 01:27:13,335
Are you sure about this?

964
01:28:24,908 --> 01:28:28,042
Come on, I'll go with you.

965
01:28:28,044 --> 01:28:29,610
No.

966
01:28:56,939 --> 01:29:01,875
What were the names
of those two twin stars again?

967
01:29:47,088 --> 01:29:49,354
Take it easy.

968
01:32:12,731 --> 01:32:15,098
<i>Back in Chicago,
enjoying the noise.</i>

969
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:19,001
<i>At least now not so much of it
is coming from inside my head.</i>

970
01:32:19,003 --> 01:32:21,770
<i>I guess I have the doctors
to thank for that.</i>

971
01:32:21,772 --> 01:32:24,839
<i>I had a dream last night -
you were in it.</i>

972
01:32:24,841 --> 01:32:28,175
<i>You waved to me.
Maybe you were waving goodbye.</i>

973
01:32:28,177 --> 01:32:32,112
<i>It doesn't matter. Whatever happens,
I'm proud of what we went through.</i>

974
01:32:32,114 --> 01:32:37,984
<i>It helps me get through the
day. That, and you in my heart.</i>
