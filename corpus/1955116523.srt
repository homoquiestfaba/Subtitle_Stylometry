1
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:42,542
"It is an honor...
and a privilege to be here today

2
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:46,202
on behalf of
all peaceful men

3
00:00:46,702 --> 00:00:49,752
from every nation in the world".

4
00:01:12,582 --> 00:01:15,252
Come on, Mike, pass!

5
00:01:15,752 --> 00:01:16,872
Over here, dude!

6
00:01:17,372 --> 00:01:19,002
No way, man!

7
00:01:23,912 --> 00:01:24,952
Hey! Did you see that?

8
00:01:25,372 --> 00:01:26,622
She looked at me!

9
00:01:28,252 --> 00:01:29,292
Focus, guys!

10
00:01:29,502 --> 00:01:30,752
You're so basic...

11
00:01:38,912 --> 00:01:41,332
Wake up, Amy!
We gotta get the flag back!

12
00:01:41,832 --> 00:01:43,542
Calm down, I'm on it!

13
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:45,582
Marty, go and help her!

14
00:01:46,082 --> 00:01:49,202
"No problemo"!
Time to try my Super Speed!

15
00:01:49,622 --> 00:01:50,792
Isn't that a lawn mower?

16
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:53,082
It was!
Now it's the Marty-Turbo...

17
00:01:53,582 --> 00:01:54,832
Oh!

18
00:01:55,332 --> 00:01:56,752
Yeah!

19
00:01:57,252 --> 00:01:58,912
Dude! You're going the wrong way!

20
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,332
Well done, Amy!

21
00:02:18,122 --> 00:02:19,162
Hey, Amy!

22
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:22,582
Here!
Let me help! I'm on my own!

23
00:02:25,372 --> 00:02:26,952
Amy! It's me, Marty!

24
00:02:27,502 --> 00:02:29,502
OK... Ah!

25
00:02:31,122 --> 00:02:33,252
Ah, ouch... ah!

26
00:02:34,002 --> 00:02:36,252
Oh... Yeah! Yeah! I've got the flag!

27
00:02:36,752 --> 00:02:37,792
Look out, Marty!

28
00:02:38,252 --> 00:02:40,082
Oh... Oh!

29
00:02:46,752 --> 00:02:47,792
'Sup, loser?

30
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,202
Ready to lose?

31
00:02:49,332 --> 00:02:50,372
Not this time...

32
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:53,752
Awesome, man! Bring it to our base!

33
00:02:57,252 --> 00:02:58,622
I'll go under the docks!

34
00:02:59,832 --> 00:03:02,122
Yeah! The Moneyball move!
Do it! Do it!

35
00:03:02,622 --> 00:03:05,202
What...?! Don't listen to Carrothead,
it's too dangerous!

36
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:08,122
Moneyball... here I go!

37
00:03:15,002 --> 00:03:16,832
He's dodging all of them like a boss!

38
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,082
Ouch!

39
00:03:20,582 --> 00:03:21,622
Oh...

40
00:03:21,752 --> 00:03:23,002
Right in the face.

41
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,252
That was awesome!

42
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,412
If you'd achieved
the Moneyball,

43
00:03:40,912 --> 00:03:43,582
I'd have put it on the school blog,
on the cover, for real!

44
00:03:44,082 --> 00:03:46,292
If he'd done it he'd now be
dating the blonde girl,

45
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:48,082
but miracles don't exist!

46
00:03:48,502 --> 00:03:49,792
... But we were close.

47
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:53,162
That's the problem, man.
We're always close...

48
00:03:53,662 --> 00:03:54,702
instead of there.

49
00:03:54,872 --> 00:03:55,912
Bye, losers!

50
00:03:56,372 --> 00:03:57,412
What's that dude got

51
00:03:57,872 --> 00:03:59,332
that I don't?

52
00:03:59,832 --> 00:04:01,252
You mean besides being hot, having

53
00:04:01,752 --> 00:04:03,792
muscles and having won three
surf contests?

54
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:05,332
Ouch, that hurts!

55
00:04:05,752 --> 00:04:07,332
¡Ha, ha! So funny...

56
00:04:21,622 --> 00:04:23,042
Hey, Igor! What's up, little guy?

57
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:25,412
Did you miss me
you little Godzilla?

58
00:04:25,912 --> 00:04:29,292
How well did you see us with
your new Marty-Glasses? They're cool, huh?

59
00:04:35,372 --> 00:04:36,832
He so couldn't live without you...

60
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:40,502
I know, we're thick as thieves.
He's always by my side.

61
00:04:41,752 --> 00:04:44,252
<i>Argh! Marty-Parachute!
Marty-Parachute!</i>

62
00:04:47,082 --> 00:04:49,912
I'm heading back, guys. We're
celebrating my dad's birthday

63
00:04:50,452 --> 00:04:52,662
and my mom wants my grandfather
to come for dinner.

64
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:54,412
Cheer up, it's your grandfather!

65
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:57,792
You obviously don't know
the old geezer.

66
00:04:58,542 --> 00:05:00,792
Er... good luck!

67
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:30,042
They delayed the mission

68
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:31,452
until 2022!

69
00:05:32,002 --> 00:05:34,122
I've been training and trying
more space suits

70
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:35,542
than a model, for nothing!

71
00:05:35,912 --> 00:05:37,252
Honey, it's your birthday.

72
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:40,042
Try to enjoy
the rest of the day.

73
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:41,582
Hey buddy, how did you do

74
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:43,872
at the beach? Did you capture
the flag?

75
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:47,332
No, I fell. Again...

76
00:05:47,872 --> 00:05:48,912
Mike's a loser, Mike's a...

77
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,162
Shut up, you brat.

78
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:07,452
Is Grandpa Frank really
coming to have dinner this time?

79
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:09,292
Don't get too excited.

80
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:14,082
Scott?

81
00:06:14,622 --> 00:06:16,662
Uh... I'll wait in the car.

82
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:18,252
Honey...

83
00:06:18,452 --> 00:06:19,792
You're wasting your time!

84
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:24,082
I see you are as stubborn
as your father.

85
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:30,832
Three, two, one...

86
00:06:31,332 --> 00:06:32,542
Oh!

87
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:34,332
Yeah!

88
00:06:34,832 --> 00:06:35,872
<i>That was awesome!</i>

89
00:06:36,202 --> 00:06:37,542
Is that Grandpa?

90
00:06:38,162 --> 00:06:40,502
I'm alright,
I'm alright!

91
00:06:49,752 --> 00:06:51,162
He's not coming.

92
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:52,702
So there won't be a cake?

93
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:54,082
That's too bad...

94
00:06:54,162 --> 00:06:56,412
Of course we'll have a cake, ladybug.

95
00:06:56,912 --> 00:07:00,252
Yeah!
Cake, cake, yes!

96
00:07:01,502 --> 00:07:03,792
If granpa doesn't want to see us,

97
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:06,292
why you still try?

98
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:09,292
Because I promised you grandma Rose

99
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:12,752
that I would do anything I could
to get them to make peace.

100
00:07:13,252 --> 00:07:14,872
So that we could be a family again.

101
00:07:15,372 --> 00:07:19,582
But... if Grandpa doesn't want to,
why can't we just leave him alone?

102
00:07:20,082 --> 00:07:22,042
Oh, Mike, never forget this:

103
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,752
your grandfather is
part of this family.

104
00:07:25,252 --> 00:07:28,122
And there's nothing more important
than family.

105
00:07:30,252 --> 00:07:32,872
That's why we can't
give up, alright?

106
00:07:43,502 --> 00:07:45,542
"His grandfather
reinvented the oil industry!"

107
00:07:46,002 --> 00:07:49,002
"His father was the great
visionary of nuclear energy!"

108
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:52,542
"And today Richard Carson III owns
the biggest energy empire in the world!"

109
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:54,082
Ladies and gentlemen,

110
00:07:54,502 --> 00:07:57,752
let's welcome Richard Carson
with a big round of applause!

111
00:08:18,002 --> 00:08:19,042
Yeah!

112
00:08:23,872 --> 00:08:26,162
How can <i>that guy</i>
be on TV?

113
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:28,162
He owns the channel.

114
00:08:32,162 --> 00:08:34,252
What's up babe?
Looking good!

115
00:08:34,702 --> 00:08:35,752
I love you, Carson!

116
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:37,082
Have it, baby!

117
00:08:37,162 --> 00:08:38,502
Ah!

118
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:40,832
Oh!

119
00:08:42,162 --> 00:08:43,202
Mr. Carson?

120
00:08:43,752 --> 00:08:45,252
Yeah!

121
00:08:46,122 --> 00:08:47,162
Yeah! Yeah!

122
00:08:47,452 --> 00:08:48,502
Mr. Carson...

123
00:08:49,002 --> 00:08:51,452
Mr. Carson, you were going to
make an announcement.

124
00:08:52,002 --> 00:08:53,662
Of course.

125
00:08:54,162 --> 00:08:56,292
Let's cut to chase.
Did you know that 50%

126
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:58,292
of the world population

127
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:00,832
think that men never set foot
on the Moon?

128
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,332
Oh, come on, what's it with this guy?

129
00:09:03,832 --> 00:09:07,002
Yes, there are all kinds of
conspiracy theories

130
00:09:08,662 --> 00:09:11,582
The Moon.
My father's biggest dream.

131
00:09:12,082 --> 00:09:14,202
He offered part of his fortune
to go.

132
00:09:14,752 --> 00:09:17,372
But NASA refused.
My father,

133
00:09:17,872 --> 00:09:19,702
a man that had everything,

134
00:09:20,252 --> 00:09:23,582
died not having been able
to achieve his biggest dream.

135
00:09:24,082 --> 00:09:25,202
Aaawww...

136
00:09:25,752 --> 00:09:27,122
Unfair!

137
00:09:27,622 --> 00:09:28,662
Well, such a mission

138
00:09:28,752 --> 00:09:30,952
requires well-prepared astronauts
, doesn't it?

139
00:09:31,502 --> 00:09:33,162
No! That was their excuse!

140
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:36,622
But today I'm going to reveal
the truth.

141
00:09:37,122 --> 00:09:41,292
The whole world will know
that the Space Race

142
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:44,752
was nothing but a big, fat... lie!

143
00:09:48,832 --> 00:09:50,372
"It's an honor...
and a priviledge

144
00:09:50,912 --> 00:09:54,122
to be here today on behalf of
all peaceful men..."

145
00:09:54,622 --> 00:09:56,292
"Ouch!".

146
00:09:58,122 --> 00:09:59,162
"Cut!".

147
00:09:59,412 --> 00:10:01,372
"I want that guy out
right now!"

148
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:05,912
"Even a trained monkey could do it
much better! I said "cut"!"

149
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:08,082
Ha! I knew it!

150
00:10:08,582 --> 00:10:10,542
What?! That was fake!

151
00:10:11,082 --> 00:10:13,162
Yeah, right! And how do you know that,
know-it-all?

152
00:10:13,662 --> 00:10:16,502
What are you talking about, idi...?!
- Scott, the children...

153
00:10:17,002 --> 00:10:18,622
And why doesn't NASA
go back to the Moon

154
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:20,662
and prove that guy's
a liar?

155
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,912
I wish we could, but we don't have
rockets prepared for that now.

156
00:10:24,412 --> 00:10:26,292
The Space Race finished
years ago.

157
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,452
Wow, your father would be
very proud of what you found.

158
00:10:31,002 --> 00:10:33,372
Daddy...
was my everything...

159
00:10:33,872 --> 00:10:37,412
When he died, I asked for his ashes
to be merged with this diamond...

160
00:10:37,912 --> 00:10:40,292
so that he would always
be with me...

161
00:10:41,002 --> 00:10:45,542
And I swore that I would do
everything in my power to honor his memory.

162
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:47,412
Aw...

163
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:49,292
Unfair!

164
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:52,912
It's time to end this fraud!

165
00:10:54,752 --> 00:10:58,372
I, Richard Carson III, will be
the first man to set foot...

166
00:10:58,872 --> 00:11:00,872
on the Moon!

167
00:11:15,622 --> 00:11:19,502
Look, daddy, he does have a rocket!
- Tess!

168
00:11:22,252 --> 00:11:24,502
Ha! That guy is awesome!

169
00:11:28,002 --> 00:11:29,872
That's for you, dad!

170
00:11:31,502 --> 00:11:34,082
Nonsense!
How can they believe that presumptuous fraud?

171
00:11:34,622 --> 00:11:38,042
We're getting thousands of messages
saying that the trip to the Moon was fake!

172
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:40,122
Social networks
are on fire!

173
00:11:40,662 --> 00:11:42,372
Everybody speaking about
"the big lie".

174
00:11:42,872 --> 00:11:46,082
Ms. President, we need
to stop this scam!

175
00:11:47,042 --> 00:11:48,952
I was just a little girl
when it happened,

176
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:52,622
but I remember very well the moment
we set foot on the Moon.

177
00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:55,332
Ms. President,
we have some intel.

178
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:57,252
Carson intends to claim the Moon

179
00:11:57,662 --> 00:11:58,702
before the United Nations.

180
00:11:59,122 --> 00:12:02,452
Impossible! We put that flag
in the name of mankind!

181
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:05,582
If he goes and destroys
what's left of the other missions,

182
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:07,082
including the flag,

183
00:12:07,582 --> 00:12:10,332
the world will believe that he is
the first man on the Moon.

184
00:12:10,832 --> 00:12:14,122
Ms. President,
give me the order and I'll turn him to dust!

185
00:12:14,662 --> 00:12:17,412
Calm down, admiral. Just keep a look
on that man.

186
00:12:17,872 --> 00:12:20,452
We will not let him
rewrite History.

187
00:12:20,952 --> 00:12:22,452
We need to do something. Now!

188
00:12:25,752 --> 00:12:27,002
Pliers.

189
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:30,252
Screwdriver.

190
00:12:31,332 --> 00:12:33,452
Will we get the flag
with this?

191
00:12:34,002 --> 00:12:35,912
I find your lack of faith
disturbing.

192
00:12:36,412 --> 00:12:37,792
The Marty-Rocket is the best.

193
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:41,042
Everytime you say that,
something terrible happens.

194
00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:44,752
Quiet, little reporter,
and let the genius work.

195
00:12:45,252 --> 00:12:48,252
Right... How did dinner
with your family go?

196
00:12:48,752 --> 00:12:50,412
Without my grandfather, as usual.

197
00:12:50,912 --> 00:12:52,792
Not cool, what's up with him?

198
00:12:53,332 --> 00:12:54,702
I don't know.

199
00:12:56,002 --> 00:12:57,252
All I know is that

200
00:12:57,752 --> 00:12:58,792
my grandfather was going to

201
00:12:59,002 --> 00:13:02,162
be part of the last mission
to the Moon.

202
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:05,582
But a few days before
the take off

203
00:13:06,082 --> 00:13:07,502
he was cut off from the mission.

204
00:13:08,002 --> 00:13:09,042
<i>Why?</i>

205
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,162
He wouldn't tell anyone.

206
00:13:10,452 --> 00:13:13,042
He just got away
from the world.

207
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,372
And one day, he left
his own home.

208
00:13:16,872 --> 00:13:19,872
And my father never understood why.
Since then,

209
00:13:20,372 --> 00:13:22,252
they barely
speak to each other.

210
00:13:22,752 --> 00:13:26,042
My mother is doing everything she can
to reunite them to no avail.

211
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:29,542
Look at the bright side! I used to have
a good six pack.

212
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,542
And now...
it's one big can.

213
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:34,582
All thanks to my grandparents,
that won't stop giving me sweets.

214
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:38,332
I don't care anymore. It's always been
like this in my family.

215
00:13:39,002 --> 00:13:40,792
Uh! Hold that.

216
00:13:41,372 --> 00:13:45,252
How can you not care? Don't say that.
You don't know what you are missing.

217
00:13:45,752 --> 00:13:47,752
I have my grandparents,
my nine siblings...

218
00:13:48,252 --> 00:13:50,912
my uncles, my cousins,
my second cousins...

219
00:13:51,412 --> 00:13:53,332
Wow, are you guys a family or
an entire country?

220
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,582
Shut up, Carrothead!

221
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:58,582
Seriously, don't give up.
You should do something about it.

222
00:13:59,082 --> 00:14:01,332
You don't get it.
I can't do anything.

223
00:14:01,832 --> 00:14:04,372
Nothing? You only need to
get them to talk.

224
00:14:04,872 --> 00:14:06,912
Yeah, right. So easy...

225
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:10,162
Ok, who cares, right?
You are such a chicken.

226
00:14:10,662 --> 00:14:11,702
Hey, I'm not a chicken!

227
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:13,002
Of course not...

228
00:14:13,082 --> 00:14:14,792
You are the king of chickens!

229
00:14:16,042 --> 00:14:17,542
Ah! Igor!

230
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:20,252
See, genius? Disaster...

231
00:14:22,252 --> 00:14:23,452
Scott!

232
00:14:24,002 --> 00:14:25,832
Scott! Scott!

233
00:14:26,912 --> 00:14:28,622
Just what's my father doing here?

234
00:14:29,082 --> 00:14:31,792
Scott! Scott! We're going back!
- Wait, what?

235
00:14:32,252 --> 00:14:33,622
National priority.

236
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:37,162
Orders from the President.
- What are you talking about, Jack?

237
00:14:37,662 --> 00:14:39,792
Sam, Scott,
we're going back to the Moon!

238
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:42,002
And you will be the commander!

239
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:49,252
The mission's as follows:
get to the Moon

240
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:51,582
before Carson
destroys the flag

241
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:53,082
that was put there in 1969.

242
00:14:53,372 --> 00:14:55,582
If there's no flag, people'll
believe we were never there.

243
00:14:56,082 --> 00:14:59,582
Wow! The Moon,
a Goldwing on the Moon...

244
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:01,122
Wait...

245
00:15:01,332 --> 00:15:02,702
And how are we
going to go?

246
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:05,292
Does the name Saturn V
ring a bell?

247
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:07,872
Are you kidding? That old piece of junk
from the NASA museum?

248
00:15:08,332 --> 00:15:09,372
Bingo!

249
00:15:09,662 --> 00:15:10,702
They're going to repair it.

250
00:15:10,752 --> 00:15:11,792
Saturn V...

251
00:15:11,872 --> 00:15:14,122
The biggest rocket
ever built.

252
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:19,002
It's going to fly again after 45 years.
We'll take off in a month.

253
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:22,872
A month?! - Impossible!
No one in NASA

254
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:25,662
knows how to pilot that relic.
- They've asked some former

255
00:15:26,162 --> 00:15:28,412
NASA astronauts for help,
they'll train us.

256
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:32,952
Well, I know somebody who's not
going to care anyway.

257
00:15:33,452 --> 00:15:34,912
You know your father.

258
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:37,622
It's the only one who refused to come.

259
00:15:38,162 --> 00:15:40,952
This is your chance, chicken.

260
00:15:41,502 --> 00:15:44,332
Ok, guys, we've got
a mission.

261
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:47,792
We need to bring this
to my grandfather.

262
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:50,872
The veterans are coming tomorrow
and he needs to be there.

263
00:15:51,372 --> 00:15:52,502
Why don't you give him a call?

264
00:15:53,002 --> 00:15:54,042
He won't pick up the phone.

265
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,542
What about an email?

266
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:57,372
He doesn't have a computer.

267
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:24,292
Come on, guys!
And remember: failure...

268
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:25,832
is not an option!

269
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:29,202
I'm always following you..
I want to be a great reporter,

270
00:16:29,752 --> 00:16:31,162
not a great criminal!

271
00:16:31,662 --> 00:16:33,752
I'll watch from here.
Here, the "walkies".

272
00:16:35,832 --> 00:16:37,412
Go with them, Godzilla.

273
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:40,502
I didn't think we would have

274
00:16:41,002 --> 00:16:42,082
a second chance.

275
00:16:42,582 --> 00:16:45,042
At my age, every second
is a second chance.

276
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:48,042
Stop the chitchat.
Let's refresh our memory.

277
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:50,162
NASA needs us.

278
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:53,832
Marty, astro-grandpas in sight.
Activate Godzilla.

279
00:16:54,332 --> 00:16:55,792
Godzilla activated.

280
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:58,292
"Conect the cell phone.
It will be your eyes".

281
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:02,752
If he breaks my phone, I'm going to
turn Carrothead into a carrot cake.

282
00:17:05,002 --> 00:17:06,752
Igor, run.

283
00:17:09,752 --> 00:17:10,872
All clear.

284
00:17:11,372 --> 00:17:12,752
"Go."

285
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:20,002
Wait, security guard coming out
from the main door.

286
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:35,912
We gotta to do something
to distract him.

287
00:17:49,252 --> 00:17:50,502
Darn it!

288
00:17:54,502 --> 00:17:55,542
Hey!

289
00:17:55,622 --> 00:17:56,662
Hi, Trent.

290
00:17:57,162 --> 00:17:58,832
Are you playing with rockets again?

291
00:17:59,292 --> 00:18:01,832
No, of course not.
We never...

292
00:18:07,082 --> 00:18:11,252
You can go on now. There's a woman
in the counter, to the left.

293
00:18:21,912 --> 00:18:23,372
Marty, get Igor
to the first floor.

294
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:25,252
"Gotcha."

295
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:41,412
Mayday, Marty,
it's the cleaning lady!

296
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,292
You see that, guys? You
clearly need my genius.

297
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:46,292
Stop boasting and do something!

298
00:18:48,122 --> 00:18:49,162
Uh, uh...

299
00:18:49,372 --> 00:18:51,412
Something happened.
I can't see anything.

300
00:18:59,332 --> 00:19:01,332
I'm going to turn him into a carrot soup.

301
00:19:03,002 --> 00:19:04,292
Marty, get Igor out of here!

302
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:05,952
But I can't see anything!

303
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:10,082
We're going to get caught! Turn it off!
Now!

304
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:13,752
Alright, failure is not an option.
Marty-Rocket, now!

305
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,082
Hey, you shouldn't be here!

306
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:34,122
Oh, I'm sorry, I was looking
for the exit...

307
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:37,082
Alright, come with me.

308
00:20:48,252 --> 00:20:49,752
Ah!

309
00:20:56,502 --> 00:20:58,702
What are you doing here?

310
00:21:23,292 --> 00:21:24,702
I'll tell him. It'll be for the best.

311
00:21:25,252 --> 00:21:27,252
I'm more eloquent
when it comes to giving news.

312
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:28,872
I'll tell him.

313
00:21:29,412 --> 00:21:32,622
No, I insist, Gigs, I am
the number one. I should tell him.

314
00:21:32,912 --> 00:21:36,952
What a piece of junk!
These drills are trash!

315
00:21:37,502 --> 00:21:39,542
You are fired! Get out of here!

316
00:21:44,162 --> 00:21:45,582
Ah!
-Ah...

317
00:21:46,582 --> 00:21:47,622
Excuse me, sir...

318
00:21:47,832 --> 00:21:51,082
but if you every need to make
another fake movie, you can count on me.

319
00:21:51,582 --> 00:21:54,622
Alright...
Now get lost.

320
00:21:56,752 --> 00:21:58,372
So, what's going on?

321
00:21:59,372 --> 00:22:00,662
Gigs has something to tell you!

322
00:22:01,122 --> 00:22:03,082
Is that so?

323
00:22:03,872 --> 00:22:08,082
Uh... NASA is going...
back to the Moon.

324
00:22:08,872 --> 00:22:10,332
What?!

325
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:13,292
And why the hell do they
have to go now?

326
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:16,292
40 years...
And they have to go now?

327
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:18,752
Whose idea was that?

328
00:22:19,252 --> 00:22:22,912
The order came from...
the... the President herself.

329
00:22:24,082 --> 00:22:27,202
Oh, so the President wants to play.
Let's see if

330
00:22:27,752 --> 00:22:29,752
she dares interfering
in my business

331
00:22:30,252 --> 00:22:31,292
when I arrive on the Moon

332
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:32,952
and I get my new toy.

333
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,082
"Carson Industries
proudly presents

334
00:22:36,582 --> 00:22:39,622
the energy of the future. The final
alternative to oil.

335
00:22:40,122 --> 00:22:42,252
"A material rarely found on Earth,
but available

336
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:44,792
on the Moon
in endless quantities".

337
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:49,001
Helium 3!

338
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,831
Aren you not going to the Moon
to fulfill your father's dream?

339
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:56,411
Ha! Dad couldn't care less
about the Moon.

340
00:22:56,911 --> 00:23:01,751
But, as he used to say: "Go like a rocket
and always fill your pocket".

341
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:11,411
I can tell you it's
an honor

342
00:23:11,911 --> 00:23:14,871
to be the commander
in this historic mission.

343
00:23:16,871 --> 00:23:17,911
Hi, Mike.

344
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:19,081
Hi, Joe.

345
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:20,331
You coming to see your father?

346
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:21,581
Yeah. What about the veterans?

347
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,911
About to arrive. Come on in.

348
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:25,541
Hey!

349
00:23:27,911 --> 00:23:29,751
Look at that!

350
00:23:31,251 --> 00:23:33,501
This is... awesome!

351
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:36,541
Oh! Take some pictures
and upload them on Facebook.

352
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,331
The girls will go crazy!

353
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:40,451
Hey, can you take a pic, Amy?

354
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:43,911
If the camera can capture
my charm, that is.

355
00:23:44,411 --> 00:23:48,201
Amy, can't you stop tweeting
for five seconds?

356
00:23:48,751 --> 00:23:51,251
I'm not tweeting,
I'm ignoring you.

357
00:23:55,411 --> 00:23:57,161
Hey, the astro-grandpas
are here!

358
00:23:57,621 --> 00:23:59,701
"Ladies and gentlemen,
it's a pleasure to announce

359
00:24:00,251 --> 00:24:03,501
the arrival of the veterans
from the lunar missions."

360
00:24:05,081 --> 00:24:06,951
Mr. Aldrin,
please look at the camera.

361
00:24:07,501 --> 00:24:08,541
Here, please,

362
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:10,331
Mr. Collins.
- I have a question.

363
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:12,001
Look at the camera, please.

364
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,541
Only one question.
- Here, Mr. Collins.

365
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:17,541
Could you answer
a question?

366
00:24:18,371 --> 00:24:21,751
Uh, weren't
dinosaurs extinct?

367
00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:23,501
He hasn't come...

368
00:24:24,001 --> 00:24:27,451
Scott, I've assigned the instructors.
You are going to love <i>yours</i>.

369
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:32,001
Surprise me! Is it Collins?
Ah, Aldrin! Tell me it's Aldrin.

370
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:40,541
Mike, look!

371
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:45,001
Ah...

372
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,041
Michael.

373
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:51,201
Scott, let me introduce you
to your instructor:

374
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:54,621
Captain in the reserve,
Frank Goldwing.

375
00:24:58,621 --> 00:25:01,001
It's truly an honor.

376
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:02,791
Sweet!

377
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:06,751
Right here, please!

378
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:09,501
Please, sir.
- Here, look, sir.

379
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,081
Look over here! Thanks.

380
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:12,831
Look at the camera please.

381
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:14,201
Yeah!

382
00:25:16,501 --> 00:25:20,251
Ah, the Goldwings! I love
family reunions.

383
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:23,291
You are the man, congratulations.
You got the cover.

384
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:26,911
But this could ruin the plan.
What if they get to the Moon before us?

385
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:30,451
Impossible! And I don't care
if we gotta cheat,

386
00:25:31,001 --> 00:25:33,541
lie, steal...
Have I said "cheat" yet?

387
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:37,161
Just make sure
the Goldwings fail.

388
00:25:42,001 --> 00:25:45,661
Flight test positive.
Starting landing simulation.

389
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:48,411
Careful,
it's a difficult maneuver.

390
00:25:48,911 --> 00:25:51,581
Understood.
- It's "Understood, Captain".

391
00:25:52,081 --> 00:25:54,501
Understood, Captain.

392
00:25:59,121 --> 00:26:01,161
Wow, man, that's boss!

393
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:03,661
How did you get here?

394
00:26:04,161 --> 00:26:05,451
Dad got us passes.

395
00:26:05,951 --> 00:26:07,541
We'll talk about that later. Step aside,

396
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:09,541
the Commander is going to land.

397
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:18,371
Dad!

398
00:26:21,911 --> 00:26:23,871
Dad, can we get on that?

399
00:26:24,371 --> 00:26:25,951
Negative, that's not a toy.

400
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:29,121
Oh, come on. It's alright, guys.
I'm in charge here.

401
00:26:29,581 --> 00:26:31,791
Commander,
you are breaking the rules.

402
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:33,331
Oh, why do you care?

403
00:26:33,371 --> 00:26:34,501
Please, Grandpa, please!

404
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:36,081
Captain, do you remember when

405
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:38,371
you gave me a ride on it?

406
00:26:38,871 --> 00:26:41,791
It's one of my best memories.

407
00:27:45,621 --> 00:27:47,411
We're out of fuel!
- "That's not possible."

408
00:27:47,911 --> 00:27:50,541
I checked it myself.
- Are you sure?

409
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:53,041
Of course!
Call off the mission, jump!

410
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:54,751
No. I can land.

411
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:59,751
No, you can't! Not at that speed.
- It's safer. Brace yourselves!

412
00:28:01,331 --> 00:28:02,501
Oh!

413
00:28:05,001 --> 00:28:07,751
Come on...!
- Oh!

414
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:09,701
Scott, jump!

415
00:28:10,451 --> 00:28:11,501
<i>Jump!</i>

416
00:28:11,911 --> 00:28:12,951
<i>Jump!!</i>

417
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:14,451
Ah!

418
00:28:21,251 --> 00:28:22,911
I'm gonna die without
kissing a girl...

419
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:25,121
I'm gonna die without
kissing a girl!

420
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:27,831
Well don't look at me, coward.

421
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:35,161
Are you alright, guys?

422
00:28:35,661 --> 00:28:37,041
Yes, Dad.

423
00:28:38,251 --> 00:28:41,751
Igor? Igor!
Igor isn't breathing!

424
00:28:43,331 --> 00:28:44,371
He needs the mouth-to-mouth!

425
00:28:44,871 --> 00:28:45,911
What?! No way!

426
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,251
Mike, do it, dude!
Look at the poor thing!

427
00:28:48,751 --> 00:28:50,371
Uh, I'll pass. It's your pet.

428
00:28:50,871 --> 00:28:51,911
Oh man!

429
00:28:52,001 --> 00:28:55,081
I was hoping my first kiss
would be with a model!

430
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:07,751
Dad, are you alright?

431
00:29:08,251 --> 00:29:09,291
Argh!

432
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:13,451
- Can you move?
- Why do you care?

433
00:29:25,751 --> 00:29:28,541
That NASA mission is still
going forward?!

434
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:31,791
Argh! No one defies
Richard Carson! No one!

435
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:34,081
Gags, let's start the test!

436
00:29:34,581 --> 00:29:36,001
Everything is ready, sir.

437
00:29:36,501 --> 00:29:38,501
Perfect. Crank it up, Gigs!

438
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:40,041
Hum...

439
00:30:12,121 --> 00:30:15,911
Impressive! 20 times
more powerful than nuclear energy!

440
00:30:16,411 --> 00:30:19,451
It'll be the biggest
monopoly in History.

441
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:22,501
Now, Gigs,
let's try it as a weapon.

442
00:30:25,501 --> 00:30:27,751
Excuse me, sir.
You'll destroy the model.

443
00:30:28,251 --> 00:30:29,791
And we have to keep testing it.

444
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:31,331
Who cares?!

445
00:30:31,751 --> 00:30:35,661
I care, sir. It took me 8 months
to build it piece by piece.

446
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:38,751
Cheer up, you're hired
for another 8 months.

447
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:40,291
Gigs, activate the weapon!

448
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:41,411
Yes, sir. But...

449
00:30:41,661 --> 00:30:45,501
Gigs, I told you to
activate the weapon!

450
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:52,911
Worked as a charm.

451
00:30:53,581 --> 00:30:56,251
But there's a little issue, sir.

452
00:30:56,751 --> 00:30:58,791
So... fix it!

453
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,831
But the thing is... Gags
was still there...

454
00:31:05,001 --> 00:31:06,371
Oh!

455
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:09,541
Well, congratulations, Gigs.

456
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:11,371
You've just been promoted.

457
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:14,501
You're now
a model supervisor.

458
00:31:21,911 --> 00:31:24,911
Scott, you can't go on like this,
cheer up.

459
00:31:25,411 --> 00:31:26,661
You'll have another chance.

460
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:30,451
No, I won't!
It was the only one and I've lost it.

461
00:31:30,951 --> 00:31:32,291
Thanks to my father.

462
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:36,701
Honey, it was an accident.
- That doesn't matter now!

463
00:31:38,951 --> 00:31:41,411
No Goldwing
will ever get to the Moon

464
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:43,251
It's a curse.

465
00:31:43,791 --> 00:31:47,041
I know it's disappointing,
but there are more important things.

466
00:31:47,581 --> 00:31:48,831
You don't get it!

467
00:31:49,331 --> 00:31:51,951
Going to the Moon
and getting the flag was my mission!

468
00:31:52,501 --> 00:31:54,661
The Moon is every astronaut's
dream!

469
00:31:55,161 --> 00:31:57,001
What is there more important than that?

470
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,951
Maybe you're the one
who doesn't get it!

471
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:10,581
History is repeating itself.

472
00:32:11,081 --> 00:32:12,661
My father will leave
and become

473
00:32:13,161 --> 00:32:15,291
a grumpy old man,
like my grandfather

474
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:17,251
My family is a disaster.

475
00:32:17,751 --> 00:32:19,371
Come on, don't say such things.

476
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:22,581
You've managed to reunite them
after, like, a thousand years.

477
00:32:23,081 --> 00:32:25,751
Yeah, and things just got
a thousand times worse.

478
00:32:26,251 --> 00:32:27,291
I'm an idiot.

479
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:30,661
Don't be like that!
Stop whining or

480
00:32:31,161 --> 00:32:33,621
I'll kick your butt
and send you to the Moon.

481
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:36,911
Ha, that would be cool.
A butt on the Moon!

482
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:48,331
Wow! Amy, you are a genius!

483
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:50,331
Who? Her...? Ha!

484
00:32:50,831 --> 00:32:54,081
My grandfather couldn't go,
my father couldn't either, but I can!

485
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:55,621
I'll go to the Moon!

486
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:57,201
Yeah, someday...

487
00:32:57,751 --> 00:32:59,911
Not someday. In two weeks!

488
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:01,581
What are you talking about?

489
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:03,791
It's crazy,
but I could hide

490
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:05,331
in the rocket and...

491
00:33:05,701 --> 00:33:06,751
Yeah right, come back to Earth.

492
00:33:06,911 --> 00:33:08,331
It would end the curse.

493
00:33:08,831 --> 00:33:11,371
I'll do what my father and grandfather
couldn't do,

494
00:33:11,871 --> 00:33:12,911
and everything will be fine!

495
00:33:13,161 --> 00:33:14,201
I'm going to the Moon!

496
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:17,001
And you two are going to help me.
Who's with me?

497
00:33:17,501 --> 00:33:19,201
I am! Marty?

498
00:33:19,751 --> 00:33:21,001
Wait, let me see if I get it.

499
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:23,291
You're gonna to get into
that old junk and

500
00:33:23,831 --> 00:33:24,871
fly at 20,000mph?

501
00:33:24,951 --> 00:33:26,001
Yeah.

502
00:33:26,201 --> 00:33:28,161
And go to a place where
there's no oxygen or gravity?

503
00:33:28,451 --> 00:33:29,501
Yeah.

504
00:33:29,701 --> 00:33:30,751
A place where, until now,

505
00:33:31,001 --> 00:33:32,291
only 12 astronauts have gone?

506
00:33:32,501 --> 00:33:33,541
Yeah.

507
00:33:33,831 --> 00:33:34,871
Ah, screw it!

508
00:33:35,081 --> 00:33:36,911
You are "astronishing"!
I'm in!

509
00:33:37,121 --> 00:33:39,541
Yeah! Yeah! I'm going to the Moon!

510
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:41,201
Ah!

511
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:44,501
Uh, dude, the Moon's that way.

512
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:10,831
So, in order to reach the rocket

513
00:35:11,331 --> 00:35:13,791
you gotta get to
the launching platform first.

514
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:16,121
But it's like a fortress
surrounded by the sea

515
00:35:16,621 --> 00:35:17,791
and protected by a metal fence.

516
00:35:18,161 --> 00:35:20,831
I've examined the options and
I think this is the best one...

517
00:35:21,331 --> 00:35:23,621
Igor! It's not time
to play Godzilla!

518
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:25,161
Come here, Igor.

519
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,001
Guys, let's focus.

520
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:28,871
Marty, what's our best option?

521
00:35:29,371 --> 00:35:33,001
Giving up, man. It's impossible to get inside.
Doesn't matter how crazy you are.

522
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:35,121
Come on! There's gotta be a way.

523
00:35:35,621 --> 00:35:37,621
Something the three of us can do.

524
00:35:38,751 --> 00:35:40,161
No, the two of you.

525
00:35:40,661 --> 00:35:43,791
What? Are you backing down?
Who's the coward now?

526
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:46,831
If my parents catch me,
I'll be grounded for life.

527
00:35:47,331 --> 00:35:48,831
They're very strict with rules.

528
00:35:49,251 --> 00:35:52,161
They'll send me to a military academy
like 3 of my 52 cousins.

529
00:35:52,661 --> 00:35:54,661
What...?

530
00:35:55,161 --> 00:35:58,451
52 plus the twins of the step-sister
of the sister in law of my uncle Pablo.

531
00:35:59,001 --> 00:36:00,041
Yeah, excuses.

532
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:03,291
I'm so sorry.

533
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:04,831
Just ignore him, Amy.

534
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:07,371
Don't worry. We'll manage.

535
00:36:07,871 --> 00:36:10,411
Well you better come up with something,
Michael Goldwing.

536
00:36:10,911 --> 00:36:12,871
There's no way we can get in there.

537
00:36:14,121 --> 00:36:16,161
There is a way!

538
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:25,331
What was that?

539
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:26,791
I heard something.

540
00:36:26,831 --> 00:36:29,541
Come on, you've become
a scaredy-cat since you saw

541
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:31,081
"Revenge of the Zombie-Rats".

542
00:36:31,411 --> 00:36:33,871
That one wasn't half as
scary as "Piranha-Zombie 3".

543
00:36:34,411 --> 00:36:37,201
Dude, you have to
do something about that...

544
00:36:41,001 --> 00:36:42,541
Marty, don't make a sound.

545
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:45,501
Ok.
I'll be as silent as a ninja.

546
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:48,791
This way!

547
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:55,251
Uh! That was close!

548
00:36:56,121 --> 00:36:57,291
What was that?

549
00:36:57,831 --> 00:36:59,871
Darn rocks...

550
00:37:02,501 --> 00:37:05,371
You and your zombie-rats...
It must've been an alligator.

551
00:37:08,251 --> 00:37:10,331
Whatever that was, it's gone.

552
00:37:13,371 --> 00:37:14,411
Oh!

553
00:37:15,081 --> 00:37:16,121
What the...?

554
00:37:16,251 --> 00:37:17,291
Marty...

555
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:27,501
Ah! I almost had a heart attack, dude!

556
00:37:41,121 --> 00:37:42,331
There it is!

557
00:37:42,831 --> 00:37:44,581
See? It's just an alligator.

558
00:37:45,121 --> 00:37:46,291
Don't fall off again.

559
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:50,161
I'm trying,
but this is full of... rocks?

560
00:37:53,501 --> 00:37:55,291
Igor, just what's
going on with you?

561
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:57,201
Can you stop making noise?

562
00:37:57,751 --> 00:37:59,581
I'm sorry.
Igor's gone bananas!

563
00:38:00,081 --> 00:38:01,751
I don't know what's up with him.

564
00:38:03,251 --> 00:38:04,371
Argh!

565
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:06,751
Mike, I think we forgot something...

566
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:10,001
Sure, sealing your mouth
with glue.

567
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:13,251
No, it's much worse! Alligators!

568
00:38:21,251 --> 00:38:24,451
Igor, attack and destroy!
Marty-Punch!

569
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:26,371
¡Marty-Poke-in-the-Eye!

570
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,001
¡Marty-Blinding-Light!

571
00:38:28,451 --> 00:38:32,161
What the heck is going on?
- Zombie-rats. It's the zombie-rats!

572
00:38:32,621 --> 00:38:34,161
Will you stop that?

573
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:40,581
Marty-Lightsaber!

574
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:51,001
It's not working!
Not working! Ah!

575
00:38:53,911 --> 00:38:54,951
Amy!

576
00:38:55,081 --> 00:38:57,451
I knew you couldn't make it
without me, Carrothead!

577
00:38:58,001 --> 00:39:00,501
What are you saying?
It's all under control!

578
00:39:04,251 --> 00:39:06,371
Guys, prepare to jump!

579
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:13,081
Turn on the fans
in three, two, one...

580
00:39:13,581 --> 00:39:14,621
Uh, guys?

581
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:15,871
Two...

582
00:39:16,161 --> 00:39:17,201
Guys...

583
00:39:17,411 --> 00:39:18,451
One...

584
00:39:18,871 --> 00:39:20,751
I don't have a fan!

585
00:39:29,581 --> 00:39:31,001
Come on!

586
00:39:34,161 --> 00:39:38,081
Higher, higher!
I'll need a bigger fan!

587
00:39:38,581 --> 00:39:39,621
Ah!

588
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:41,081
Marty!

589
00:39:42,621 --> 00:39:43,661
I'm stuck!

590
00:39:43,951 --> 00:39:45,001
Wait, we'll get you out.

591
00:39:45,121 --> 00:39:47,501
Don't worry,
the guards are coming, go!

592
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:50,581
Thank you, dude, we owe you one.

593
00:39:51,081 --> 00:39:52,791
Go on without me!

594
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:56,541
I will sacrifice myself for
this mission! I'll be fine... Uh...

595
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:58,331
Igor, where are you going?

596
00:39:58,831 --> 00:40:01,161
You traitor!
Don't leave me!

597
00:40:10,751 --> 00:40:13,751
There you have your zombie-rat...

598
00:40:20,371 --> 00:40:22,371
Mr. Carson,
can you look here?

599
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:25,951
Sir, a picture, please.
- Mr. Carson, a question.

600
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:28,251
What do you hope
to find on the Moon?

601
00:40:28,751 --> 00:40:30,291
Bye bye, earthlings!

602
00:40:30,791 --> 00:40:33,411
I'm going to make history!

603
00:40:52,161 --> 00:40:54,161
Did you check
the ventilation systems?

604
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,001
Yes, everything's working.

605
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:40,161
Wait, Mike!
It'll be better if I go home now.

606
00:41:40,661 --> 00:41:44,501
OK, but I need you to
close the hatch.

607
00:41:53,581 --> 00:41:56,501
The thing is I sleepwalk.
Sounds weird, I know.

608
00:41:57,001 --> 00:41:59,951
But when I woke up,
I didn't know how to go back and...

609
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:02,451
You think you are so smart, huh?

610
00:42:03,001 --> 00:42:04,621
This is abuse of authority.

611
00:42:05,121 --> 00:42:06,581
I demand to speak to your boss.

612
00:42:07,081 --> 00:42:09,001
Don't worry, here he comes.

613
00:42:11,581 --> 00:42:12,831
Uh, oh...

614
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:30,331
Wow! Amy, look at this!

615
00:42:30,831 --> 00:42:33,541
I can't believe we're here.

616
00:42:34,001 --> 00:42:35,041
Are you alright, son?

617
00:42:35,331 --> 00:42:36,371
Dad.

618
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:38,661
Hey, what were you doing in the launching zone?

619
00:42:38,911 --> 00:42:41,371
Uh... I'll only speak
in presence of my lawyer.

620
00:42:41,831 --> 00:42:42,871
Marty!

621
00:42:43,121 --> 00:42:44,161
"Marty, do you copy?"

622
00:42:44,291 --> 00:42:45,541
"We're in the casserole."

623
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:47,871
"Can you hear me? We're in."

624
00:42:48,581 --> 00:42:51,201
In? What does that "in" mean?

625
00:42:53,251 --> 00:42:56,041
When you arrive on the Moon
take a picture, OK?

626
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:58,621
It'll be the cover
of the school newspaper.

627
00:42:59,121 --> 00:43:00,161
Sure.

628
00:43:00,331 --> 00:43:03,161
Can you tell me how on Earth
did you get here?!

629
00:43:03,661 --> 00:43:05,871
Uh, Grandpa...
What are you doing here?

630
00:43:06,371 --> 00:43:09,581
Have you gone crazy?
Get out! Now!

631
00:43:11,331 --> 00:43:14,501
What have you done?

632
00:43:17,621 --> 00:43:18,661
Sabotage in process.

633
00:43:18,791 --> 00:43:21,831
The rocket will take off without
its crew and get lost in the void.

634
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:25,501
"Perfect. 'Sayonara', Ms President".

635
00:43:26,581 --> 00:43:28,911
Don't move!

636
00:43:33,121 --> 00:43:34,161
What the...?

637
00:43:34,541 --> 00:43:37,121
Engines 1 and 2, activated!

638
00:43:37,621 --> 00:43:39,001
What?!

639
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:42,251
Eh...

640
00:43:44,081 --> 00:43:47,411
All engines are on?
What have you done?

641
00:43:47,911 --> 00:43:49,371
Uh?

642
00:43:50,871 --> 00:43:52,291
Can you help us open this?

643
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:54,911
Impossible,
it's blocked!

644
00:43:55,411 --> 00:43:57,201
Mission control, do you copy?

645
00:43:57,751 --> 00:43:58,791
"Frank Goldwing speaking."

646
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:01,751
"We're trapped in
the Apolo Module".

647
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,501
What a night...
Another one like this

648
00:44:07,001 --> 00:44:08,041
and I quit.
- Calm down.

649
00:44:08,371 --> 00:44:09,751
There won't be more surprises

650
00:44:10,251 --> 00:44:13,251
before take off.

651
00:44:17,251 --> 00:44:19,121
Wait a minute...

652
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:34,081
Have you seen that, Jack?
- Doesn't make any sense.

653
00:44:34,581 --> 00:44:37,291
The spacecraft was
to take off in 10 hours!

654
00:44:38,661 --> 00:44:40,041
Call Goldwing!

655
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:42,621
Hey, you there!

656
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:44,121
Don't move!

657
00:44:44,621 --> 00:44:45,911
This place is off-limits!

658
00:45:01,585 --> 00:45:03,918
What happened?
- Don't get anxious, but...

659
00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:06,835
The system has been sabotaged.
We can't stop it.

660
00:45:07,293 --> 00:45:08,585
It's your...

661
00:45:09,085 --> 00:45:10,543
Cool, isn't it?

662
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:13,543
Wait, Scott!

663
00:45:16,085 --> 00:45:17,127
Hello, Mr. Gold...

664
00:45:17,252 --> 00:45:18,293
Silence!

665
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:19,752
...wing.

666
00:45:24,293 --> 00:45:27,293
Mission Control here.
What are you doing in there, Captain?

667
00:45:28,377 --> 00:45:30,585
I was taking care of
a couple of stowaways...

668
00:45:31,085 --> 00:45:34,210
"when the hatch got locked."
- Stowaways?

669
00:45:37,002 --> 00:45:38,252
Captain, what are you doing?

670
00:45:39,918 --> 00:45:40,960
Ah!

671
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:42,710
Frank, who's over there?

672
00:45:44,002 --> 00:45:47,335
I found your son and his girlfriend
inside the capsule.

673
00:45:47,627 --> 00:45:48,877
Huh?

674
00:45:50,502 --> 00:45:51,543
What...?
Girlfriend?

675
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:52,793
Excuse me?

676
00:45:53,002 --> 00:45:54,168
She's not my girlfriend!
I don't want a girlfriend!

677
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:55,752
How could he believe that?

678
00:45:56,252 --> 00:45:57,294
"Don't care about girls."

679
00:45:57,502 --> 00:46:00,252
That's what I was trying to say.
- We're just friends.

680
00:46:00,752 --> 00:46:02,793
Enough is enough!
Mike! What are you doing there?!

681
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:05,585
I just wanted to break
the curse of our family!

682
00:46:06,085 --> 00:46:08,835
Curse? Which curse?
What are you talking about?

683
00:46:09,335 --> 00:46:10,668
We don't have time for arguing.

684
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:14,960
We have two options:
going to the Moon or ejecting!

685
00:46:15,502 --> 00:46:17,418
That would be the end of the mission!

686
00:46:21,335 --> 00:46:22,377
Yes?
- "Sir,"

687
00:46:22,835 --> 00:46:23,877
we've been sabotaged.

688
00:46:24,002 --> 00:46:25,710
They won't believe
who's behind this...

689
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,043
Stop Carson,
don't let him take off.

690
00:46:28,543 --> 00:46:30,835
"To all units,
stop Richard Carson."

691
00:46:31,335 --> 00:46:32,418
"Stop Carson."

692
00:46:32,918 --> 00:46:35,335
Done. Let's go, Gigs.

693
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:37,168
One minute left until launching.

694
00:46:37,668 --> 00:46:39,460
Captain,
activate the eject mechanism.

695
00:46:40,002 --> 00:46:42,293
Please!
We must get rid of the curse!

696
00:46:42,793 --> 00:46:44,376
Captain, activate it now!

697
00:46:47,835 --> 00:46:51,710
"Captain? Captain?
Captain, what's going on?"

698
00:46:52,252 --> 00:46:56,377
I'm afraid the mechanism
has been sabotaged as well.

699
00:46:59,127 --> 00:47:01,293
In that case,
we only have one option left...

700
00:47:02,918 --> 00:47:03,960
We're going to the Moon.

701
00:47:04,502 --> 00:47:07,085
That's the first thing
we've agreed on in 40 years.

702
00:47:07,627 --> 00:47:10,835
Let the launch start.
Confirm if you're ready.

703
00:47:11,335 --> 00:47:12,668
Eecom! Fido!
- Ready.

704
00:47:13,252 --> 00:47:14,710
GNC! Retro!
- Ready.

705
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:16,710
So we're setting off, Captain?

706
00:47:17,252 --> 00:47:20,335
Call me "Commander".
Ready for launching.

707
00:47:20,835 --> 00:47:21,877
CAP COM!
- Ready.

708
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:22,960
Doctor!
- Ready.

709
00:47:23,043 --> 00:47:24,085
Guidance!
- More than ready.

710
00:47:24,543 --> 00:47:25,585
Green light!

711
00:47:25,835 --> 00:47:27,418
No, no, no, no!
I can't stay here!

712
00:47:27,918 --> 00:47:30,127
I have to get out of here!
My parents will kill me!

713
00:47:30,627 --> 00:47:32,918
This is a one in a lifetime chance!
You'll be the first woman

714
00:47:33,418 --> 00:47:35,043
to be on the Moon!

715
00:47:35,543 --> 00:47:38,418
Stop chitchatting, kids,
and put your suits on.

716
00:47:40,752 --> 00:47:42,418
Everything's ready
for take-off, sir.

717
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,168
We're setting off, Daddy!

718
00:47:45,877 --> 00:47:48,127
One rule!
I break one single rule in my life...

719
00:47:48,627 --> 00:47:51,710
and I end up in a rocket
heading to the Moon. Cool!

720
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:55,127
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a mission to accomplish.

721
00:47:55,627 --> 00:47:59,294
"Commander, let's take that flag
before Carson destroys it."

722
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,793
And remember,
failure is not an option.

723
00:48:02,293 --> 00:48:03,918
Excuse me...
Mmm, sir...

724
00:48:04,418 --> 00:48:07,168
Oh, has anyone seen my lizard?

725
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:08,960
Igor!

726
00:48:09,335 --> 00:48:10,752
Ignition sequence.

727
00:48:11,252 --> 00:48:14,294
"Ten, nine, eight, seven,

728
00:48:14,793 --> 00:48:17,543
six...
Engines running."

729
00:48:26,168 --> 00:48:28,127
Let's put out a great show.

730
00:48:43,585 --> 00:48:44,627
Three,

731
00:48:44,835 --> 00:48:46,043
"two, one..."

732
00:48:53,418 --> 00:48:54,627
"Launching!"

733
00:48:55,127 --> 00:48:56,710
"We've taken off at 10 hours,"

734
00:48:57,252 --> 00:48:58,877
23 minutes and 17 seconds!

735
00:49:02,085 --> 00:49:04,752
Yay!

736
00:49:05,252 --> 00:49:06,293
Ah!

737
00:49:09,002 --> 00:49:11,419
Yeeha!

738
00:49:20,668 --> 00:49:22,210
An old man and two kids?

739
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:25,377
The crew of Saturn Five are...

740
00:49:25,918 --> 00:49:26,960
an old man and two kids?

741
00:49:27,252 --> 00:49:29,377
Yes, Ms. President...
But that's not all...

742
00:49:29,877 --> 00:49:31,418
Go on.

743
00:49:31,877 --> 00:49:35,210
Carson has developed a system
to extract Helium 3 from the Moon.

744
00:49:35,752 --> 00:49:37,877
Helium 3 is
the most powerful source of energy

745
00:49:38,418 --> 00:49:40,585
known to date.
- Now it all makes sense.

746
00:49:41,085 --> 00:49:43,418
He's deceived the world
and sabotaged our rocket

747
00:49:43,918 --> 00:49:45,543
with the only goal of becoming

748
00:49:46,085 --> 00:49:47,835
the most powerful man on Earth.

749
00:49:48,377 --> 00:49:51,418
Ms. President, we can fire
some missiles to get rid of him.

750
00:49:51,918 --> 00:49:52,960
Calm down, Admiral.

751
00:49:53,252 --> 00:49:56,168
If we arrive before he does,
we'll prove he's a liar.

752
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:59,293
We need that flag,
and this old man and these kids

753
00:49:59,835 --> 00:50:02,668
are our only hope.

754
00:50:36,543 --> 00:50:37,585
Oh...

755
00:50:37,752 --> 00:50:39,335
It's amazing...

756
00:50:40,877 --> 00:50:42,210
Impressive.

757
00:50:42,752 --> 00:50:44,043
Mind-blowing!

758
00:50:45,085 --> 00:50:46,127
Hey!

759
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:47,418
"Marty, are you there?"

760
00:50:47,793 --> 00:50:48,835
Wah!

761
00:50:49,252 --> 00:50:51,960
Hello. Mission Control here.
Is Igor with you?

762
00:50:52,502 --> 00:50:55,085
Affirmative. He's perfectly fine.

763
00:50:56,085 --> 00:50:58,918
Got it. The engineers
have fixed the system.

764
00:50:59,377 --> 00:51:01,293
Now we have
control over the flight.

765
00:51:04,585 --> 00:51:06,793
Scott, tell me it's a joke.

766
00:51:07,335 --> 00:51:09,752
Sam, I don't know how it could...
- Tell me our son...

767
00:51:10,252 --> 00:51:12,418
isn't inside that rocket!
-Calm down, calm down.

768
00:51:12,918 --> 00:51:14,085
Everything's going to be fine.

769
00:51:15,252 --> 00:51:16,502
"I'm sorry, Mom!"

770
00:51:17,002 --> 00:51:19,127
"This is all my fault."

771
00:51:19,627 --> 00:51:22,293
Oh, goodness!
Mike! Are you okay?

772
00:51:22,835 --> 00:51:26,377
Yes...
I'm very sorry about this fuss.

773
00:51:26,835 --> 00:51:31,002
Honey, that doesn't matter now.
Come back safely, understood?

774
00:51:31,543 --> 00:51:32,585
I promise.

775
00:51:32,793 --> 00:51:35,252
Mom, do I get his room?

776
00:51:35,752 --> 00:51:36,793
Tess!

777
00:51:36,918 --> 00:51:38,002
Oh, hello Mrs. Goldwing.

778
00:51:38,502 --> 00:51:41,460
Tell my parents I won't break
the rules ever again!

779
00:51:42,002 --> 00:51:43,043
I will, Amy.

780
00:51:43,377 --> 00:51:47,043
Frank, for God's sake,
look after them.

781
00:51:47,543 --> 00:51:51,293
Trust me.
I won't let anything happen to them.

782
00:51:53,502 --> 00:51:55,293
Are you my grandpa?

783
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:05,127
Here I go, riding my spaceship...

784
00:52:05,627 --> 00:52:06,668
Sir, an alert.

785
00:52:06,752 --> 00:52:09,127
NASA's rocket is approaching.

786
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:11,502
What?! How's that even possible?

787
00:52:12,002 --> 00:52:13,668
There's just one possible answer:
it's manned.

788
00:52:14,127 --> 00:52:15,168
<i>The sabotage failed.</i>

789
00:52:15,752 --> 00:52:19,460
Ah... I'm surrounded
by a bunch of loafers.

790
00:52:20,002 --> 00:52:23,085
Alright, I'll have to take care
of this myself.

791
00:52:27,418 --> 00:52:30,585
You can't do that, sir.
There's an old man and two kids in there.

792
00:52:31,085 --> 00:52:32,127
So what?!

793
00:52:32,168 --> 00:52:33,585
As my father said:

794
00:52:34,085 --> 00:52:38,377
"Go like a rocket
and always fill your pocket"

795
00:52:49,043 --> 00:52:51,543
Oh, I can't believe it.

796
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,085
What?

797
00:52:53,502 --> 00:52:54,544
The Marty-Survival Kit.

798
00:52:54,918 --> 00:52:57,460
And he was supposed to survive
just on this for three days?

799
00:52:58,002 --> 00:53:00,210
What's wrong, dude?
That's the base of my diet.

800
00:53:00,752 --> 00:53:01,793
Let's open one!

801
00:53:01,835 --> 00:53:03,168
No, wait!

802
00:53:06,418 --> 00:53:07,460
What do you bet?

803
00:53:07,585 --> 00:53:08,627
I bet I'll catch more than you!

804
00:53:09,127 --> 00:53:10,168
Don't even dream about it.

805
00:53:16,002 --> 00:53:18,002
Oh!

806
00:53:20,668 --> 00:53:22,502
Hey, that's cheating. That one was mine.

807
00:53:41,335 --> 00:53:42,585
Hey!

808
00:53:45,293 --> 00:53:46,460
The last one is for me.

809
00:53:47,002 --> 00:53:48,335
No way!

810
00:53:51,085 --> 00:53:52,793
Oh...

811
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:57,002
So just friends...
- Ah...

812
00:54:05,127 --> 00:54:07,002
Hey, what was that?

813
00:54:08,043 --> 00:54:09,752
Commander, what's that noise?

814
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:16,377
<i>Something hit us.
It's trying to break through the casing.</i>

815
00:54:17,502 --> 00:54:21,168
Stay here. Don't go outside,
no matter what, understood?

816
00:54:23,543 --> 00:54:24,585
I'm getting out of the capsule.

817
00:54:25,085 --> 00:54:26,918
I repeat.
I'll proceed to get out of the capsule.

818
00:54:27,418 --> 00:54:28,877
"What? Frank, no!"

819
00:54:29,418 --> 00:54:30,460
Frank! Frank!

820
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,293
I don't know if he's deaf
or just the most stubborn guy in the world!

821
00:54:34,752 --> 00:54:36,502
It's the latter.

822
00:54:43,252 --> 00:54:44,293
Grandpa!

823
00:54:44,502 --> 00:54:47,168
I must help him.
Put your helmet on, I'm going outside.

824
00:54:47,502 --> 00:54:49,418
Hold on!
What are we doing about Igor?

825
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:06,877
Ready!

826
00:55:08,918 --> 00:55:10,418
There I go, Grandpa!

827
00:55:16,585 --> 00:55:18,252
Ah...

828
00:55:20,835 --> 00:55:22,460
<i>Darn electric spider!</i>

829
00:55:23,002 --> 00:55:24,252
Go away!

830
00:55:25,793 --> 00:55:29,002
Ah! Oh!

831
00:55:29,502 --> 00:55:31,335
Oh!

832
00:55:43,918 --> 00:55:45,085
Yeah!

833
00:55:45,585 --> 00:55:47,752
We did it, Grandpa!

834
00:55:48,252 --> 00:55:49,293
You disobeyed me
and almost got killed!

835
00:55:49,835 --> 00:55:51,668
I... I'm sorry. I just wanted to...

836
00:55:52,168 --> 00:55:54,252
Don't ever disobey my orders.

837
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:57,252
Roger, Commander...

838
00:56:04,002 --> 00:56:05,043
Ah...

839
00:56:17,502 --> 00:56:20,627
Okay, we'll do it your way.
Give me an order.

840
00:56:28,252 --> 00:56:31,252
Mike, help me with the bandage.

841
00:56:32,252 --> 00:56:33,585
It's an order.

842
00:56:42,668 --> 00:56:44,668
You saved my life.

843
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:47,002
You've been really brave.

844
00:57:12,377 --> 00:57:13,627
Scott?

845
00:57:14,502 --> 00:57:17,835
No, I'm Sam. Scott's sleeping.

846
00:57:18,293 --> 00:57:20,627
"How are the kids doing?"

847
00:57:21,127 --> 00:57:23,877
They're fine.
They're fast asleep.

848
00:57:24,377 --> 00:57:26,168
They'll be back home soon.

849
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:30,502
"I promise."
- Thanks, Frank.

850
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:33,335
<i>Samantha...</i>

851
00:57:33,835 --> 00:57:36,585
Thanks for never giving up.

852
00:57:37,418 --> 00:57:40,752
I'm more grateful than you think.

853
00:57:41,377 --> 00:57:42,418
Thank your grandson.

854
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:45,335
"For better or worse,

855
00:57:45,835 --> 00:57:47,460
this is his doing."

856
00:57:49,627 --> 00:57:51,793
Frank, enjoy the moment.

857
00:57:52,252 --> 00:57:55,252
Fate owed you this journey.

858
00:57:55,752 --> 00:57:57,210
Now rest.

859
00:57:57,752 --> 00:57:58,918
Good night.

860
00:58:05,502 --> 00:58:07,460
I just wanted our family

861
00:58:08,002 --> 00:58:09,543
to be back together.

862
00:58:12,793 --> 00:58:17,085
Commander,
why did you leave home?

863
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:22,835
Go back to sleep...

864
00:59:36,752 --> 00:59:38,127
Are you my grandpa?

865
00:59:39,002 --> 00:59:42,127
Detaching in course.
Splitting lunar module.

866
00:59:49,668 --> 00:59:51,751
"Module detached."

867
00:59:52,627 --> 00:59:55,085
Starting landing sequence.

868
00:59:55,585 --> 00:59:58,668
Don't worry,
your father will make it.

869
00:59:59,252 --> 01:00:01,002
Starting descent.

870
01:00:12,543 --> 01:00:14,293
Wow...

871
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:18,710
Commander, you're deviating

872
01:00:19,252 --> 01:00:21,793
from the path.
Fix the navigation.

873
01:00:22,252 --> 01:00:23,377
Roger.

874
01:00:26,877 --> 01:00:29,252
Commander, do you need help?

875
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:31,252
I'm fine.

876
01:00:39,918 --> 01:00:42,293
Commander, I'll say it again:
you're out

877
01:00:42,793 --> 01:00:44,043
of the path.

878
01:00:46,627 --> 01:00:50,127
Let me help you, Grandpa.
Er... Commander.

879
01:00:55,877 --> 01:00:57,793
Alright, use your controls.

880
01:01:01,793 --> 01:01:04,252
Slowly. Smooth moves.

881
01:01:06,877 --> 01:01:08,835
It works better now.

882
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:13,085
What?

883
01:01:13,585 --> 01:01:14,627
What happened?
Was it me?

884
01:01:15,002 --> 01:01:16,043
No, it wasn't you.

885
01:01:16,127 --> 01:01:17,418
Alarm 1201.

886
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,252
Hey! I didn't touch anything!

887
01:01:19,752 --> 01:01:21,752
Gentlemen, emergency protocol.

888
01:01:22,293 --> 01:01:24,710
"It seems the on-board computer
has been damaged."

889
01:01:25,252 --> 01:01:26,585
That's why it was so hard to operate.

890
01:01:27,127 --> 01:01:29,043
It's leading us to the wrong place.
Can you hear me?

891
01:01:29,543 --> 01:01:33,043
Roger, Commander. You'll need
to deactivate the guidance system.

892
01:01:33,585 --> 01:01:34,627
That's what happened in 1969.

893
01:01:35,085 --> 01:01:37,002
The chances of success are minimal.

894
01:01:37,502 --> 01:01:39,335
The same ones I have
on this hottie.

895
01:01:39,835 --> 01:01:42,627
Amy, find it. There should be
a button with "AGC" on it.

896
01:01:43,127 --> 01:01:44,168
Mike, to the left.

897
01:01:44,585 --> 01:01:46,460
AGC. AGC.

898
01:01:47,002 --> 01:01:49,335
<i>20 seconds to landing.
- Too fast.</i>

899
01:01:52,293 --> 01:01:53,752
AGC...

900
01:01:55,918 --> 01:01:57,002
Slow down!

901
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:00,585
Hurry up! The computer's giving
contradictory instructions!

902
01:02:01,085 --> 01:02:02,127
Where are you?

903
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:04,252
10 seconds...
- They're going to crash.

904
01:02:04,752 --> 01:02:05,793
Frank!

905
01:02:06,168 --> 01:02:07,210
Let's get going!

906
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:08,918
"Eight, seven, six..."

907
01:02:09,127 --> 01:02:10,168
Amy, please.

908
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:11,335
"Five, four..."

909
01:02:11,835 --> 01:02:13,043
"Three..."

910
01:02:13,585 --> 01:02:14,627
I got it!

911
01:02:15,043 --> 01:02:17,002
Press it, for God's sake!

912
01:02:21,377 --> 01:02:24,377
"Mission Control,
Base of Peace of Mind here."

913
01:02:24,877 --> 01:02:26,169
"The Falcon has landed."

914
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:27,752
Hooray!

915
01:02:28,043 --> 01:02:29,752
Oh...

916
01:02:32,877 --> 01:02:36,002
You've done great, guys.

917
01:02:37,502 --> 01:02:38,835
Yeah! Yay!

918
01:02:39,335 --> 01:02:40,835
Ah!

919
01:02:47,585 --> 01:02:48,710
Ready? We're recording.

920
01:02:49,252 --> 01:02:50,668
Amy, you're live.

921
01:02:51,168 --> 01:02:53,002
Everybody's watching you.

922
01:03:11,877 --> 01:03:13,002
Grandpa...

923
01:03:50,585 --> 01:03:53,418
How cool! For Amstrong
it might've been just a small step,

924
01:03:53,918 --> 01:03:54,960
but for me it's going to be...

925
01:03:55,502 --> 01:03:57,335
Wow!

926
01:04:09,002 --> 01:04:13,168
Yes! Yes!
I'm the first woman on the Moon!

927
01:04:21,585 --> 01:04:23,668
We're back
just like the first time,

928
01:04:24,252 --> 01:04:27,627
as a light of hope
for mankind.

929
01:04:34,668 --> 01:04:36,918
Come on, kids,
we have a mission.

930
01:04:45,377 --> 01:04:47,127
We're losing the signal.

931
01:04:47,627 --> 01:04:49,293
Commander,
the antenna is damaged.

932
01:04:49,793 --> 01:04:52,335
Transferring communications
to the antenna of the lunar rover.

933
01:04:52,835 --> 01:04:55,668
Get that flag. Let the world
see who arrived first!

934
01:04:56,252 --> 01:04:57,752
Yeah, rock and roll!

935
01:04:58,252 --> 01:04:59,543
Yay!

936
01:05:10,002 --> 01:05:12,085
Look, Mike and Amy are on TV.

937
01:05:12,585 --> 01:05:13,793
Hurry up, Grandpa!

938
01:05:18,877 --> 01:05:21,627
We should be near it.

939
01:05:26,252 --> 01:05:28,335
There it is! The flag!

940
01:05:36,085 --> 01:05:37,627
Oh, no!

941
01:05:38,127 --> 01:05:40,252
It can't be.

942
01:05:49,752 --> 01:05:51,168
Ha, I knew it!

943
01:05:51,752 --> 01:05:53,127
Losers!

944
01:05:54,502 --> 01:05:57,293
Oh. What are we doing now?

945
01:05:59,793 --> 01:06:03,460
My job here is done.
Gigs, take the minibots to the base.

946
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:05,044
Hurry up!

947
01:06:05,377 --> 01:06:06,502
Yes, sir.

948
01:06:14,168 --> 01:06:15,210
Oh, goodness.

949
01:06:15,543 --> 01:06:18,168
They're going to destroy
the remains of all the missions.

950
01:06:18,668 --> 01:06:21,585
Hey, Amy, they're still there!
Come on, record it!

951
01:06:23,335 --> 01:06:24,377
We lost the signal!

952
01:06:24,835 --> 01:06:26,543
What's happening?
Commander, can you hear me?

953
01:06:27,043 --> 01:06:28,085
What happened?

954
01:06:29,835 --> 01:06:32,127
Oh, how unexpected.
What's next, TV ads?

955
01:06:32,627 --> 01:06:34,460
We're unable
to restore the communication.

956
01:06:35,002 --> 01:06:37,210
Transfer the communication
to another antenna.

957
01:06:37,752 --> 01:06:40,710
Impossible. The one in the rover
was the only one working.

958
01:06:41,252 --> 01:06:44,502
We need to restore
the communication, no matter what!

959
01:06:49,668 --> 01:06:50,710
Hey.

960
01:06:51,002 --> 01:06:52,127
Where can I plug this?

961
01:06:52,627 --> 01:06:55,710
Do you intend to connect an USB
to a 1969 computer? Are you nuts?

962
01:06:56,252 --> 01:06:57,752
I might be able to fix it...

963
01:06:58,293 --> 01:06:59,918
Yes, I need to establish a connection

964
01:07:00,418 --> 01:07:03,792
through any guidance station
in the world. I hope.

965
01:07:04,292 --> 01:07:08,834
Come home, baby.
You'll be my personal trophy.

966
01:07:12,876 --> 01:07:14,042
<i>He has the flag!</i>

967
01:07:14,501 --> 01:07:16,792
Let's take it back.

968
01:07:24,626 --> 01:07:26,751
Come on, Igor. Take the flag.

969
01:07:33,001 --> 01:07:34,084
Huh?

970
01:07:36,542 --> 01:07:38,376
Oh! What the...?

971
01:07:41,292 --> 01:07:44,167
Go away, you disgusting alien!

972
01:07:45,084 --> 01:07:46,792
Let's go.

973
01:07:48,917 --> 01:07:50,251
Ha!

974
01:07:51,126 --> 01:07:53,584
Ah!

975
01:07:55,834 --> 01:07:57,126
Come on Igor, jump!

976
01:08:02,501 --> 01:08:04,501
What?! That flag's mine!

977
01:08:05,001 --> 01:08:06,042
<i>Ha!</i>

978
01:08:06,292 --> 01:08:07,376
Ah!

979
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:11,792
Yeah! Oh! We did it!

980
01:08:12,667 --> 01:08:14,126
Oh!

981
01:08:14,709 --> 01:08:15,751
No!

982
01:08:15,834 --> 01:08:16,876
Ah!

983
01:08:17,292 --> 01:08:18,667
Watch out!

984
01:08:19,876 --> 01:08:20,917
Ah!

985
01:08:25,126 --> 01:08:26,251
Grandpa!

986
01:08:27,876 --> 01:08:30,959
This isn't over yet!

987
01:08:31,459 --> 01:08:35,626
I want a full report of the communication
systems in the module. Now!

988
01:08:37,792 --> 01:08:39,334
Ha!

989
01:08:42,542 --> 01:08:46,126
It's fine if we have to redirect
the satellite. We'll just do it!

990
01:08:48,042 --> 01:08:50,626
Listen, where can I find
a radio from the sixties?

991
01:08:51,084 --> 01:08:53,709
There's a bunch
of old gadgets in the basement.

992
01:09:00,042 --> 01:09:01,542
Oh, come on!

993
01:09:03,042 --> 01:09:04,709
We lost communication,

994
01:09:05,251 --> 01:09:06,584
we can't pilot this thing

995
01:09:07,084 --> 01:09:11,751
and that lunatic kidnapped
Grandpa... We're done.

996
01:09:16,834 --> 01:09:17,876
Huh?

997
01:09:22,584 --> 01:09:24,292
Hello, my gooey cockroaches!

998
01:09:24,792 --> 01:09:26,834
Oh, shut up, you weirdo.

999
01:09:28,542 --> 01:09:30,167
Listen, you little thieves.

1000
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:33,750
"I'll propose you a deal.
If you give me the flag"

1001
01:09:34,251 --> 01:09:36,417
I'll give you
the old wreck back.

1002
01:09:36,917 --> 01:09:38,459
No, Mike, don't do it!

1003
01:09:39,001 --> 01:09:40,042
Grandpa!

1004
01:09:40,126 --> 01:09:43,042
You don't have to answer now.
I'll call you in...

1005
01:09:43,542 --> 01:09:45,125
"ten seconds."

1006
01:09:45,626 --> 01:09:48,167
Oh, I love being generous.

1007
01:09:49,001 --> 01:09:50,334
No, wait!

1008
01:09:52,084 --> 01:09:53,126
It's over.

1009
01:09:53,376 --> 01:09:54,668
No, we can't give up.

1010
01:09:55,167 --> 01:09:57,251
There's nothing left to do, Amy.

1011
01:09:58,334 --> 01:09:59,376
Time up!

1012
01:09:59,834 --> 01:10:01,292
We accept the deal.

1013
01:10:01,792 --> 01:10:04,542
Good guy.
Bring me the flag.

1014
01:10:08,751 --> 01:10:10,084
I got it!

1015
01:10:16,417 --> 01:10:19,501
Darn it! I need something
that increases electric resistance.

1016
01:10:20,001 --> 01:10:21,584
Copper, tin!

1017
01:10:23,001 --> 01:10:25,251
Huh? I think this will do.

1018
01:10:26,626 --> 01:10:28,459
He's very mean.

1019
01:10:39,751 --> 01:10:40,792
What's this?

1020
01:10:41,251 --> 01:10:42,292
What's the matter?

1021
01:10:42,667 --> 01:10:44,251
I'm getting messages...

1022
01:10:44,792 --> 01:10:46,626
It can't be! The antenna is broken.

1023
01:10:47,126 --> 01:10:48,751
Seriously, I keep getting them.

1024
01:10:49,251 --> 01:10:53,042
That's impossible. There's
nothing here that can transmit from..

1025
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:57,292
Marty!

1026
01:11:04,001 --> 01:11:06,501
Ah!

1027
01:11:08,751 --> 01:11:11,543
You reached your destination.

1028
01:11:13,584 --> 01:11:15,751
I couldn't stand it anymore.

1029
01:11:25,667 --> 01:11:27,501
Wow! It's huge!

1030
01:11:41,751 --> 01:11:43,751
"Adjusting gravity."

1031
01:11:47,751 --> 01:11:49,292
Open the door.

1032
01:12:12,126 --> 01:12:13,167
Welcome.

1033
01:12:13,626 --> 01:12:16,042
Let's get straight to the point.
Give me the flag!

1034
01:12:16,542 --> 01:12:17,751
First, my grandfather!

1035
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:20,376
Of course.
A deal is a deal.

1036
01:12:20,876 --> 01:12:21,917
Gigs.

1037
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:27,584
Grandpa!

1038
01:12:27,667 --> 01:12:28,709
Mike!

1039
01:12:29,084 --> 01:12:30,834
Oh... I love family reunions.

1040
01:12:31,042 --> 01:12:32,292
Don't you, Gigs?

1041
01:12:32,834 --> 01:12:34,001
I can't remember my family, sir.

1042
01:12:34,542 --> 01:12:35,584
Let him go!

1043
01:12:36,042 --> 01:12:37,251
Give me the flag or I'll get

1044
01:12:37,751 --> 01:12:38,917
rid of the old wreck.

1045
01:12:43,751 --> 01:12:45,334
Alright! I'll give you the flag.

1046
01:12:45,876 --> 01:12:46,917
How moving.

1047
01:12:52,126 --> 01:12:53,501
Gigs, release him.

1048
01:13:13,501 --> 01:13:16,959
And after a reunion,
there's always a goodbye.

1049
01:13:17,501 --> 01:13:18,709
Gigs, get rid of them.

1050
01:13:19,251 --> 01:13:20,542
What? Excuse me, sir?

1051
01:13:21,042 --> 01:13:22,792
You're miserable, Mr. Carson.

1052
01:13:23,292 --> 01:13:24,542
What'd you know, you maggot?

1053
01:13:25,042 --> 01:13:26,584
You think you're a genius,
but we all know

1054
01:13:27,084 --> 01:13:29,292
you'd be a nobody
without for your father's money.

1055
01:13:29,792 --> 01:13:32,376
How dare you... you brat!

1056
01:13:32,876 --> 01:13:36,626
He's right. He always spoonfed you.
You've done nothing at all!

1057
01:13:37,126 --> 01:13:38,292
You know nothing, you annoying kid!

1058
01:13:38,792 --> 01:13:41,084
Do you think all this stuff
was built by itself?!

1059
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:43,751
Do you mean this factory
or whatever this is?

1060
01:13:44,251 --> 01:13:46,209
It's more than a factory,
you ignorant brat!

1061
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:48,834
It's a mine of Helium 3,
the biggest source

1062
01:13:49,334 --> 01:13:51,376
of energy ever known.

1063
01:13:51,876 --> 01:13:54,917
And it is only mine!
Behold my work!

1064
01:13:55,417 --> 01:13:57,334
My father
would be proud of me!

1065
01:14:01,584 --> 01:14:04,834
Of a liar like you? You deceived
the world by saying that humans

1066
01:14:05,334 --> 01:14:06,417
had never been to the Moon.

1067
01:14:06,917 --> 01:14:10,584
Proud of my brightness.
Only a genius could deceive everyone.

1068
01:14:11,084 --> 01:14:14,292
Only a genius could get their hands
on the largest energetic monopoly.

1069
01:14:14,792 --> 01:14:16,959
I'll sell my energy to the whole planet

1070
01:14:17,501 --> 01:14:19,959
and if any country
is unwilling to pay,

1071
01:14:20,501 --> 01:14:21,709
boom!, I'll disintegrate it.

1072
01:14:22,251 --> 01:14:24,334
Just like what I'm going
to do with you.

1073
01:14:24,834 --> 01:14:29,042
"Go like a rocket
and always fill your pocket."

1074
01:14:29,917 --> 01:14:30,959
Cool!

1075
01:14:31,501 --> 01:14:33,334
Cool? How's that cool?

1076
01:14:33,834 --> 01:14:36,709
You just gave me
the best headline ever.

1077
01:14:37,251 --> 01:14:39,542
What are you talking about,
you little brat?

1078
01:14:42,751 --> 01:14:44,709
Worldwide exclusive!
Richard Carson

1079
01:14:45,251 --> 01:14:47,542
just confessed he's a criminal.

1080
01:14:49,584 --> 01:14:53,792
Smile, we're on air!
The whole world is watching you.

1081
01:14:54,292 --> 01:14:55,334
"What's going on?"

1082
01:14:55,667 --> 01:14:58,625
"What's going on? Gigs?
What's this all about? Gigs!"

1083
01:14:59,126 --> 01:15:02,584
Amy González reporting live from the Moon.
We're heading back to Earth.

1084
01:15:03,084 --> 01:15:04,126
Yeah!
Yeah!

1085
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:05,709
Great!

1086
01:15:08,667 --> 01:15:10,709
Yeah, great!
- Losers...

1087
01:15:11,209 --> 01:15:13,001
I always trusted NASA.

1088
01:15:13,501 --> 01:15:16,126
See?
An old computer from NASA,

1089
01:15:16,626 --> 01:15:20,793
my 800 GHz Marty-Antenna,
four little gadgets

1090
01:15:21,292 --> 01:15:24,167
and "voilà"
the new Marty-Communicator!

1091
01:15:24,667 --> 01:15:27,042
How could they communicate
with Earth? How?!

1092
01:15:27,542 --> 01:15:28,959
Come on, Igor, now!

1093
01:15:29,501 --> 01:15:31,542
They have their own
portable antenna.

1094
01:15:32,042 --> 01:15:33,084
Ah!

1095
01:15:33,542 --> 01:15:34,792
Did you let them in

1096
01:15:35,292 --> 01:15:38,417
with that gadget?! You're fired!

1097
01:15:40,334 --> 01:15:41,376
This way!

1098
01:15:41,751 --> 01:15:43,376
Don't let them escape!
Come on, stop them!

1099
01:15:43,876 --> 01:15:45,334
But am I fired or not?

1100
01:15:45,834 --> 01:15:47,584
Gigs!

1101
01:15:56,126 --> 01:15:58,084
Watch out! Jump!

1102
01:16:13,501 --> 01:16:14,542
No!

1103
01:16:21,626 --> 01:16:23,709
Commander, can you hear me?

1104
01:16:25,251 --> 01:16:26,626
Grandpa!

1105
01:16:27,126 --> 01:16:28,167
Mike!

1106
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,834
Ah!

1107
01:16:32,417 --> 01:16:33,459
Mike, stop it.

1108
01:16:33,626 --> 01:16:35,126
I'm not losing you again.

1109
01:16:35,584 --> 01:16:36,709
Stop. Listen to me.

1110
01:16:38,251 --> 01:16:42,001
Mike, my helmet is broken.
I'm running out of oxygen.

1111
01:17:01,792 --> 01:17:03,709
In the spaceship,
you asked me...

1112
01:17:04,501 --> 01:17:07,084
something I haven't answered
for 40 years.

1113
01:17:13,334 --> 01:17:15,501
Why did you leave home?

1114
01:17:25,959 --> 01:17:28,251
A few days before
the mission to the Moon,

1115
01:17:28,709 --> 01:17:31,751
your father came back from school
with chicken pox.

1116
01:17:34,084 --> 01:17:36,167
So you caught it and that's why...

1117
01:17:36,667 --> 01:17:38,292
they didn't allow you
to go to the Moon?

1118
01:17:40,626 --> 01:17:44,292
Yes. I was infected.
And I was replaced.

1119
01:17:44,792 --> 01:17:47,542
And you blamed Dad?
It wasn't his fault!

1120
01:17:48,042 --> 01:17:50,501
That's true. It wasn't.

1121
01:17:51,042 --> 01:17:53,251
But going to the Moon was
what I longed for the most.

1122
01:17:53,792 --> 01:17:56,792
And losing my chance
made me feel like a loser

1123
01:17:57,292 --> 01:17:58,917
"who deserved nothing."

1124
01:17:59,501 --> 01:18:01,084
"Not even my family."

1125
01:18:01,584 --> 01:18:02,792
"Actually,"

1126
01:18:03,292 --> 01:18:06,084
I felt horrible
for blaming Scott.

1127
01:18:06,584 --> 01:18:10,917
"I looked at my son and felt ashamed
of holding a grudge against him."

1128
01:18:11,792 --> 01:18:15,250
"And because of that,
I thought I was a bad father."

1129
01:18:16,042 --> 01:18:20,084
"I felt so bad I thought
he'd be better off without me."

1130
01:18:20,584 --> 01:18:22,084
I was wrong.

1131
01:18:23,126 --> 01:18:26,626
That was
the biggest mistake of my life.

1132
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:35,667
"Now, hit it!"

1133
01:18:37,376 --> 01:18:39,001
"Move aside, Grandpa!"

1134
01:18:46,167 --> 01:18:49,292
It's a great story.
Shall we end it on Earth?

1135
01:18:54,584 --> 01:18:55,626
No! Not again!

1136
01:18:56,042 --> 01:19:00,584
I got you! This is the last time
you'll ever fool me!

1137
01:19:01,167 --> 01:19:03,917
Seriously, I can't stand that thing!

1138
01:19:20,167 --> 01:19:24,126
You ruined my plans!
My life!

1139
01:19:24,626 --> 01:19:26,792
And now
you're gonna pay for it!

1140
01:19:27,292 --> 01:19:28,667
Hurry up, guys!
We gotta get away!

1141
01:19:29,209 --> 01:19:30,376
We won't get far together.

1142
01:19:30,876 --> 01:19:34,126
You're running out of oxygen.
Go back to the spaceship.

1143
01:19:34,626 --> 01:19:36,667
Trust me, Grandpa.
I have a plan.

1144
01:19:37,167 --> 01:19:38,917
Amy, use it as a surfboard.

1145
01:19:39,417 --> 01:19:40,834
But Mike...!

1146
01:19:42,876 --> 01:19:45,417
Run away, Grandpa!
Do you want this, Carson?

1147
01:19:45,917 --> 01:19:46,959
Die!

1148
01:19:54,292 --> 01:19:55,584
What's your plan?

1149
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:58,751
Getting an actual kiss
from you before I die.

1150
01:19:59,251 --> 01:20:00,501
What?! Look out!

1151
01:20:03,751 --> 01:20:05,751
Let's teach them a lesson, Dad!

1152
01:20:12,126 --> 01:20:14,751
Ah, ah! The alien strikes back! Ah!

1153
01:20:22,001 --> 01:20:24,292
Ah, I'm gonna crush you, maggot!

1154
01:20:39,417 --> 01:20:40,501
Ha!

1155
01:20:46,834 --> 01:20:48,334
Marty, I need you.

1156
01:20:48,834 --> 01:20:50,001
Yes, I'm essential.

1157
01:20:50,501 --> 01:20:52,251
Activate the Marty-Rocket now.

1158
01:20:52,751 --> 01:20:55,334
Are you sure? Do you know
it's still undergoing trial?

1159
01:20:55,834 --> 01:20:56,876
Just do it!

1160
01:20:57,209 --> 01:20:58,834
Okay, okay.
Marty-Rocket activated!

1161
01:21:00,001 --> 01:21:01,792
Ah!

1162
01:21:02,292 --> 01:21:03,501
Hit it! Now!

1163
01:21:08,167 --> 01:21:09,209
I got you!

1164
01:21:09,501 --> 01:21:10,542
OK, this deserves a kiss.

1165
01:21:10,751 --> 01:21:12,042
Let me tell you the plan first.

1166
01:21:12,542 --> 01:21:15,292
Guys, what's going on up there?
Did I miss something?

1167
01:21:36,001 --> 01:21:38,834
Come on, Daddy,
let's crush these brats.

1168
01:21:42,834 --> 01:21:43,876
Marty, slow down!

1169
01:21:47,251 --> 01:21:49,834
Speed up, speed up!
No, slow down. Now go faster!

1170
01:21:50,334 --> 01:21:52,042
Dude, will you make up your mind?

1171
01:21:55,751 --> 01:21:58,001
What? I'm a machine!

1172
01:21:58,501 --> 01:22:00,376
Where are we going?
Please, tell me the plan.

1173
01:22:00,876 --> 01:22:02,667
Carson still has
the mine of Helium 3.

1174
01:22:03,167 --> 01:22:04,917
It's a danger
for all humanity.

1175
01:22:05,417 --> 01:22:06,917
What should we do?
In order to

1176
01:22:07,417 --> 01:22:09,167
avoid it we'd have to destroy the base!

1177
01:22:09,667 --> 01:22:10,709
That's the plan.

1178
01:22:11,001 --> 01:22:12,876
What?!
Have you lost it?!

1179
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:16,084
Oh, Mike, don't tell me
you're thinking about...

1180
01:22:16,584 --> 01:22:17,626
Are you going to do...?

1181
01:22:18,084 --> 01:22:19,501
The Moneyball.

1182
01:22:22,084 --> 01:22:25,001
Trust me, Amy.
Are you with me?

1183
01:22:34,251 --> 01:22:35,334
I'll smash you!

1184
01:22:36,834 --> 01:22:37,876
I'll destroy you!

1185
01:22:38,251 --> 01:22:39,501
Hold me!

1186
01:22:40,001 --> 01:22:42,251
I'll crush you
like cockroaches! Ah!

1187
01:22:59,251 --> 01:23:00,542
Oh...

1188
01:23:04,751 --> 01:23:06,751
Mike, can you hear me?

1189
01:23:08,751 --> 01:23:10,584
Mike, can you hear me?

1190
01:23:13,251 --> 01:23:15,001
"Mike, can you hear me?!"

1191
01:23:59,001 --> 01:24:02,043
Hooray, yes!... Dad!

1192
01:24:02,542 --> 01:24:05,126
Mission accomplished, Grandpa!

1193
01:24:05,751 --> 01:24:06,792
Not yet.

1194
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:09,292
There's something left to do.

1195
01:24:15,042 --> 01:24:19,334
"In 1969, the human race
achieved a great milestone

1196
01:24:19,834 --> 01:24:23,084
and planted a flag
to claim the Moon

1197
01:24:23,542 --> 01:24:25,625
on behalf of the whole humanity."

1198
01:24:26,167 --> 01:24:28,500
"Today, almost 50 years later,

1199
01:24:29,126 --> 01:24:31,126
we repeat that same movement

1200
01:24:31,709 --> 01:24:34,917
highlighting the fact that
this beautiful natural satellite

1201
01:24:35,376 --> 01:24:40,209
doesn't belong to a single person,
company or country,

1202
01:24:40,751 --> 01:24:42,834
but to the human race."

1203
01:24:43,667 --> 01:24:47,250
"Something next generations
must protect

1204
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:50,584
together, just like a family."

1205
01:24:53,584 --> 01:24:55,084
Yay!

1206
01:26:26,792 --> 01:26:30,251
<i>You always come back.</i>

1207
01:26:30,751 --> 01:26:34,001
<i>You guide my steps.</i>

1208
01:26:34,501 --> 01:26:37,001
<i>Everything is different</i>

1209
01:26:37,542 --> 01:26:41,292
<i>if I think you're there.</i>

1210
01:26:41,792 --> 01:26:45,042
<i>I leave my fears</i>

1211
01:26:45,542 --> 01:26:48,792
<i>far away from here.</i>

1212
01:26:49,292 --> 01:26:52,126
<i>I change my path</i>

1213
01:26:52,626 --> 01:26:55,751
<i>just for you.</i>

1214
01:26:56,251 --> 01:26:59,417
<i>I follow you.</i>

1215
01:26:59,917 --> 01:27:02,001
<i>I follow you.</i>

1216
01:27:02,542 --> 01:27:07,167
<i>I follow you till the end.</i>

1217
01:27:07,667 --> 01:27:09,126
<i>Nothing changes us.</i>

1218
01:27:09,626 --> 01:27:12,042
<i>Nobody will stop us.</i>

1219
01:27:22,251 --> 01:27:24,334
<i>Nothing changes us.</i>

1220
01:27:24,792 --> 01:27:26,876
<i>Nobody will stop us.</i>

1221
01:27:28,001 --> 01:27:29,667
<i>Nothing changes us.</i>

1222
01:27:30,126 --> 01:27:33,876
<i>Nothing will change us.</i>

1223
01:27:37,251 --> 01:27:40,001
<i>Nothing will change us.</i>

1224
01:27:44,501 --> 01:27:49,501
<i>Nothing will change us.</i>

1225
01:27:59,251 --> 01:28:03,626
<i>I follow you.</i>

1226
01:28:19,167 --> 01:28:22,001
Dad? Am I in heaven?

1227
01:28:23,917 --> 01:28:25,376
Is that you, Dad?

1228
01:28:25,876 --> 01:28:27,417
Eh... Mr. Carson?

1229
01:28:27,917 --> 01:28:28,959
Gigs?

1230
01:28:29,042 --> 01:28:31,042
What are you doing here?
And without a helmet...

1231
01:28:31,542 --> 01:28:34,417
It turns out I don't need it.
I'm an android.

1232
01:28:34,917 --> 01:28:36,251
Gags made me.

1233
01:28:37,292 --> 01:28:41,126
Gigs, if you see this,
it's because your life is fading away.

1234
01:28:41,626 --> 01:28:45,709
That's it, Gigs,
you're an android. I created you.

1235
01:28:46,251 --> 01:28:49,459
Oh, poor thing.
You lost your father too.

1236
01:28:49,959 --> 01:28:51,542
Yes, you killed him, sir.

1237
01:28:52,042 --> 01:28:54,042
Don't worry, I'll forgive you.

1238
01:28:54,542 --> 01:28:55,917
Now you have me.

01:28:59,376 --> 01:29:02,084
Gigs, can we turn off
that damn annoying robot?

1240
01:29:02,542 --> 01:29:05,042
No sir, it has an infinite
Helium 3-driven battery.

1241
01:29:05,542 --> 01:29:06,584
Perfect.

1242
01:29:07,001 --> 01:29:08,292
What kind of idiot
authorised this?

1243
01:29:08,792 --> 01:29:10,542
It was you, sir.

1244
01:29:11,042 --> 01:29:14,501
Oh. Well, nobody's perfect.
