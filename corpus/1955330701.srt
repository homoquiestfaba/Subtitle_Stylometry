00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:25,157
STEVE: Smile.
(CAMERA CLICKS)

2
00:00:25,157 --> 00:00:26,792
(LAUGHTER)
Got you.

3
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:28,160
SUSAN: Okay, wait, one
more in front of the house.

4
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:32,598
STEVE: All right, now.

5
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,500
One, two, three.

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,567
(CAMERA CLICKS)

7
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:37,436
Oh, that's a happy family.
Thanks.

8
00:00:37,436 --> 00:00:39,538
Steve, I can't
thank you enough.

9
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:41,306
If you hadn't put in a
good word with the elders...

10
00:00:41,306 --> 00:00:43,375
Oh, forget it. The best
part of being a deacon

11
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,576
is doing a favor
for a friend.

12
00:00:44,576 --> 00:00:46,745
No, this is something
special though.

13
00:00:46,745 --> 00:00:49,048
There's even room
for my piano. It's just...

14
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,682
So, now our kids
can hang out, Susan.

15
00:00:50,682 --> 00:00:51,784
Isn't that something?
Another generation.

16
00:00:51,784 --> 00:00:54,086
I know. Tell Nancy
I said hello.

17
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:56,088
STEVE: Done.

18
00:00:56,088 --> 00:00:58,089
Remember now, we got a pool
and a hot tub out back.

19
00:00:58,089 --> 00:00:59,458
So, you all come over
any time you like,

20
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,360
whether we're home or not.

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,429
(CHUCKLES) Well, thanks, but we've
got a lot of unpacking to do.

22
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:04,329
You sure you don't
need any help?

23
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:05,079
No.

24
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,132
If you lug one more
heavy thing around,

25
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:08,484
you're liable to have
a heart attack.

26
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:09,835
And then where will
you be when we need you?

27
00:01:09,835 --> 00:01:11,737
Don't worry.
I'm not going anywhere.

28
00:01:11,737 --> 00:01:13,305
See you later.
Bye.

29
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,744
(GRUNTS) This is
the last one, is it?

30
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:20,245
Yes. Wait.

31
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:22,181
I got it. Ready?

32
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:24,183
One, two, three, drop.

33
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:25,617
You got it. Okay.
(LAUGHS)

34
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:29,755
What is this?

35
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:30,722
What?

36
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:34,359
That is just loose plaster,

37
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:35,561
probably from the drywall.

38
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:40,632
I cannot believe
we're finally here.

39
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:42,768
I think we're gonna
like it here.

40
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:45,838
Can you?
You wanna grab that part?

43

Good to see you.

44
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:57,316
I'd like you to meet
the pastor, all right?

45
00:01:57,852 --> 00:01:59,485
Pastor Vickers,

46
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:00,719
I'd like you to meet
Susan and Gary Wilson.

47
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,521
Hello, nice to meet you.
How are you, sir?

48
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:04,106
STEVE: Just moved in
across the street.

49
00:02:04,106 --> 00:02:05,690
VICKERS: Oh, we're glad to have
you as part of the community.

50
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,426
Well, thank you.
It was a lovely sermon.

51
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:08,360
VICKERS: Thank you.
We'll see you next week.

52
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,628
Yes, definitely.

53
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:10,896
Good word this morning.
Thank you very much.

54
00:02:10,896 --> 00:02:13,599
Listen, uh, Gary and Susan,

55
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,602
I'd like you to meet
Jack and Mary Bennett.

56
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:18,604
They just moved in a couple
months before you.

57
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:19,705
It's nice to meet you.

58
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:21,406
And I've already got Jack
signed up

59
00:02:21,406 --> 00:02:22,541
on the building committee,

60
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:23,893
but Mary,
I'm still working on.

61
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,244
Well, you're wasting
your time.

62
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:26,545
I got a baby at home.

63
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:28,097
There aren't enough hours
in a day.

64
00:02:28,097 --> 00:02:29,648
Well, the parenting class
sounds interesting.

65
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:32,317
You know, uh, that's
really just for folks

66
00:02:32,317 --> 00:02:33,652
with really young kids.

67
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:34,887
I think they're
already full, but...

68
00:02:34,887 --> 00:02:36,372
Nice to meet you.

69
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:37,856
I'm hoping you're gonna work
with the teen group.

70
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:40,626
Susan? Welcome to
our church.

71
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:41,727
SUSAN: Hey, Nancy.

72
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:43,245
Oh, my goodness,
look at you.

73
00:02:43,245 --> 00:02:44,762
You are just as pretty as you
were back in high school.

74
00:02:44,762 --> 00:02:45,898
You have not changed a bit.

75
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:47,733
(CHUCKLES) Well,
thank you very much.

76
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,935
Wouldn't it be great if Susan helped
with the teen group, sweetheart?

77
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:52,538
Oh, absolutely.
It'll be so much fun.

78
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:54,173
And, you know what?
Steve can really use a backup.

79
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,175
I mean, between all
his committees and the farm,

80
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,409
he's barely ever home.

81
00:02:57,409 --> 00:02:58,944
How many committees
are you on, Steve?

82
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,612
Oh, it's nothing.
I enjoy it.

83
00:03:00,612 --> 00:03:01,947
Don't you let him
pressure you, though, Susan,

84
00:03:01,947 --> 00:03:04,099
if you're too busy.

85
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:06,250
No, the teen group sounds
like fun. I'd like that.

86
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,820
Now, listen. They're having their
big labor day game this afternoon.

87
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,789
And, you know, Orin could
play on Kris' team.

88
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:11,857
Right, absolutely.
Okay.

89
00:03:11,857 --> 00:03:12,958
Why don't you all come?
We will.

90
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,326
All right.
Lovely to see you.

91
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:15,727
Very good to see you.
Let's go, guys.

92
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:16,662
Bye, now.

Joanne, you're looking
bright and happy today.

96
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:27,406
Oh, thank you.
What can I get you?

97
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:28,674
Hot dog.
All right.

98
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,411
Is that Chanel No. 5
you're wearing?

99
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:33,779
You amaze me, Steve.

100
00:03:33,779 --> 00:03:37,216
(LAUGHS) All I can smell
is hot dogs and fries.

101
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,318
Your grandson is playing
a great game today.

102
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:40,652
He's a shoo-in
for all-star.

103
00:03:40,652 --> 00:03:42,621
We've got
our fingers crossed.

104
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:44,389
Kris is looking
good today.

105
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:45,791
Yeah, I've been
working with him.

106
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,326
Is your son
on the team, too?

107
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:48,660
Yeah.

108
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,729

Anybody can make an error.

111
00:03:57,903 --> 00:04:00,505
Listen, Joanne, don't you
run with some of the girls?

112
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:03,508
Yeah. Tisha and Mary.
We jog a few times a week.

113
00:04:03,508 --> 00:04:05,444
Aren't you looking for
somebody to run with, Susan?

114
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:07,580
I am, actually, yes.

115
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,715
Well, we meet at the levee around 8:30
after we drop the kids off at school.

116
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:11,450
You're welcome to join us.

117
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,385
Well, thank you.
Great.

118
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:15,287
Oh, and thanks for helping
James with our fence.

119
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:16,455
I really appreciate it.

120
00:04:16,455 --> 00:04:18,924
Oh, it's nothing. Nothing.

121
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:21,593
She's married to one of the
elders, James Biggs. Great couple.

122
00:04:21,593 --> 00:04:23,862
Yeah, she seems nice.

123
00:04:23,862 --> 00:04:25,831
Working here is great for
getting to know everybody.

124
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,734
You've got a customer.

I love your new hairdo.

You look like
a movie star.

127
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:35,958
I did too lose the game.

128
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,343

ball, then we would have won.

other good plays you had?

Orin can spend the night.

there, Orin. ORIN: Thanks.

So, what do you say?
Yeah, I suppose so.

137

You'll be sure to monitor
their TV time, though, right?

138

Sure.

don't have cable.

You know, they're running
a big special now.

141
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,710
It's okay. We don't need it
right now. Thank you, though.

your help, Susan.

keep up with them.

friends already. Yeah.

actually.

you're right.

We are gonna be
so happy here.

we've moved in and all.

00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,108
Steve.

175
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:52,677
Set your watch by him.

176
00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:55,580
Oh, he's headed out
to the farm.

177
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,150
Didn't you know him way back when,
before I moved out here, Susan?

178
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,752
Yeah, I went to school
with him and Nancy,

179
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:02,421
back in Starkville,
Mississippi.

180
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,890
Is it true he and Nancy
were high-school sweethearts?

181
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,758
Yeah.

182
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:08,894
We kind of thought Steve was
out of his league... (ALL LAUGH)

183
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:11,096
Because she was
such a brain.

184
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:13,432
But, he was really
persistent.

185
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:15,767
I mean, he sent her flowers every
day until she started dating him.

186
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:17,936
I've known them
going on 10 years now,

187
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:20,038
and she just amazes me.

188
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:22,774
She supports that family while
Steve gets that farm on its feet.

189
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:24,876
Here.

190
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,515
Y'all! Y'all!
(LAUGHTER)

191
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,757
I hate it here.

192
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:42,461
All the kids have their
own little cliques

193
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:43,929
and no one's looking
for new members.

194
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,599
We just moved here
a month ago, Em.

195
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,700
It takes time to make
new friends.

196
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:52,237
It's not gonna
happen here. I know it.

197
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,005
Hey.

198
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,174
Sure it will.

199
00:07:58,645 --> 00:07:59,878
I know just how
you feel.

200
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:00,912
I felt the same way
when I was your age.

201
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,114
You're gonna do
just fine.

202
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,984
Okay? Believe me.

203
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:08,954
You're just too special.

204
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:09,921
(CHUCKLES)

205
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,190
Okay?

206
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:22,968
(PLAYING PIANO)

207
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,127
(GASPS)
(PLAYING STOPS)

208
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,965
It's just Mr. Glover,
sweetie. It's okay.

209
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,871
What are you doing out there?
(CHUCKLES) You scared us half to death.

210
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:01,973
I was just
about to knock.

211
00:09:01,973 --> 00:09:04,025
Listen,
Nancy's working late.

212
00:09:04,025 --> 00:09:06,076
I'm gonna go downtown and meet her
for supper. I need a big favor.

213
00:09:06,076 --> 00:09:07,546
Could you feed the boys?

214
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,881
Oh, sure, uh,

215
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:11,616
if they don't mind red beans and
rice, I'll set two more plates.

216
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:13,618
Great. Thank you.

217
00:09:13,618 --> 00:09:15,619
By the way, Emily, have you
tried out for any sports?

218
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:17,889
You know, it's a great way to
get involved and make friends.

219
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,758
No, sir.

220
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:21,944
(CHUCKLES)

221
00:09:21,944 --> 00:09:24,129
You remind me so much of your
mother at your age, sweet but shy.

222
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,064
(HORN HONKING)

223
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,198
Daddy!

224
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:31,803
Well... There he is.

225
00:09:31,803 --> 00:09:33,104
Just send the boys over.
Sure.

226
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,678
Emily started to open up
earlier today,

227
00:09:39,678 --> 00:09:42,147
and then Steve dropped by and
made her all self-conscious.

228
00:09:42,147 --> 00:09:43,147
How?

229
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:46,818
Just talking to her about how she's
sweet and shy like her mother.

230
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,755
And what did she tell you?

231
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:54,125
She misses her old school, she's
having problems making new friends.

232
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,361
Yeah. Well, it always
takes a little time.

233
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:58,330
Yeah, that's what
I told her.

234
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,931
But when you're her age,

235
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:01,700
time is warped, you know?

236
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,269
Waiting for someone to call
you could feel like 100 years.

237
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:06,188
(SIGHS)

238
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,106
You know, it's good you're
working with the teen group.

239
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:10,642
Maybe we should
invite them all over.

240
00:10:10,642 --> 00:10:12,143
Might help her out
a little bit.

241
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,880
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

242
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,383
STEVE: Smile now.
That's nice.

243
00:10:18,383 --> 00:10:21,152
One, two, three.

244
00:10:21,152 --> 00:10:22,887
(CAMERA CLICKS)
Aw, that's a nice one.

245
00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:24,222
That's a real nice one.

246
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:30,362
I just love your parenting class,
Pastor Vickers, I hope you do it again.

247
00:10:30,362 --> 00:10:32,163
Oh.
Oh, that would be great.

248
00:10:32,163 --> 00:10:34,649
I would have joined
if it weren't so full.

249
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:37,134
Well, we'd always make room for you,
Susan. We never turn anyone away.

250
00:10:37,134 --> 00:10:38,403
Oh, I was under
the impression

251
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:40,138
that it was for people
with younger kids.

252
00:10:40,138 --> 00:10:42,941
Oh, no. It's for anybody
who's interested.

253
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:46,711
Uh. Hey, Steve, I think you had the
wrong idea about that parenting class.

254
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:48,813
Oh, well, I must
have confused it

255
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:50,715
with something else.

256
00:10:50,715 --> 00:10:53,284
You know, we always have great
classes going on around here.

257
00:10:53,284 --> 00:10:54,753
I wish I had time
to take them all.

258
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:55,987
STEVE: Well, Tish?

(CAMERA CLICKS)
(CHUCKLES)

260
00:10:57,255 --> 00:10:59,658
You need to make time.

261
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:01,126
I got to go back,
check up on Nancy.

262
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:04,429
Here you go.

263
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:07,298
By the way, you're all welcome
to stop by and jump in the hot tub

264
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:10,001
when you're through here.
Night's still young.

265
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:11,936
Are you sure
Nancy's up to it?

266
00:11:11,936 --> 00:11:13,905
Well, she's still in bed,
but she won't mind.

267
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:16,408
Is she sick? She's got that
little cold that's going around,

268
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:18,209
but if everybody came by,
probably cheer her up.

269
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:20,845
Bless her heart.

270
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,721
Hi. Come on in.

271
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,132
Um, I brought your mother
some chicken soup.

272
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:43,401
Uh, yes, ma'am.
She's just back there.

273
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,037
Thank you.

274
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,285
Nancy?

275
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:01,820
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)
It's Susan Wilson.

276
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,954
NANCY: Come in.

277
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:05,357
Hey.

278
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,792
Steve said you weren't
feeling well.

279
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:09,360
Oh, it's only a cold.

280
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,130
But, of course, Steve
insists that I stay in bed.

281
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,332
I mean, that's why
this place is such a mess.

282
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,102
Oh, forget it.

283
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:19,404
Um, I brought you
some chicken soup.

284
00:12:19,404 --> 00:12:21,072
Oh, thank you.

285
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,310
I just had a sandwich,

286
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,945
so would you mind if I just
saved it for later?

287
00:12:26,945 --> 00:12:28,513
No. No, of course not.

288
00:12:28,513 --> 00:12:29,781
Great.

289
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,753
Well, thank you again.

290
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,755
You're welcome. Um, I'll
just leave it in the kitchen.

291
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,123
That would be great.
Okay.

292
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:39,190
Okay.

293
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,093
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

294
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,465
Hey. How did your
mission of mercy go?

295
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:50,802
Not exactly like
I expected, but...

296
00:12:50,802 --> 00:12:53,304
Nancy must be really sick.
Their house is in chaos.

297
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,086
Hey, hey, hey, girl.

298
00:13:08,086 --> 00:13:09,220
Hi.

299
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,823
What's this?

300
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:13,324
What's it look like?
A healthy pear tree.

301
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,027
But, uh, why?

302
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:19,164
A housewarming present.

303
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:21,249
A little late, but it's the
thought that counts, right?

304
00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:23,333
I did a little weeding in the back,
too. It was looking a little ragged.

305
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,470
Oh, Steve, Gary would have
taken care of that.

306
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,972
Oh, he's got enough on his plate
as it is. It's the least I can do.

307
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,543
It's never the least
you can do.

308
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:35,313
It's always
way too much.

309
00:13:35,313 --> 00:13:38,016
You don't like the tree?
No. The tree is great.

310
00:13:38,016 --> 00:13:39,517
But...
But, what?

311
00:13:39,517 --> 00:13:41,085
Now Gary can spend the weekend
with you and the kids,

312
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:42,320
instead of the weedwacker.

313
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,890
Well, thank you, then.
All right.

314
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,996
Wouldn't say no to
a tall glass of lemonade.

315
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:53,865
(CHUCKLES)
Forget lemonade.

316
00:13:53,865 --> 00:13:56,167
You're coming for lunch
after what you did.

317
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:58,036
I'm gonna take these in and get
cleaned up. I'll see you later.

318
00:13:58,036 --> 00:13:59,103
Great.
Okay.

319
00:13:59,103 --> 00:14:00,572
I'll come back.
Okay.

320
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,420
(HUMMING)

321
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,304
MR. BISHOP: Hi.

322
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:35,573
Mr. Bishop,
how are you doing?

323
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:38,476
New mailman brought me
your bills.

324
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:40,645
I don't need them.
GARY: Well, thank you, sir.

325
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:43,181
Steve's sure been busy
around your place.

326
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:47,285
Weeding and planting, up
and down in your attic. Oh.

327
00:14:47,285 --> 00:14:49,153
I got tired just
watching him. (BOTH LAUGH)

328
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:51,022
See you.
I'll see you.

329
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:52,590
STEVE: Gary, what do you
think of your pear tree?

330
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,895
What's it doing here?

331
00:14:56,895 --> 00:15:00,131
Your housewarming present. I
did some weeding out back, too.

332
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:03,368
Thank you. Mr. Bishop said you've
been in and out of the attic.

333
00:15:03,368 --> 00:15:05,637
Yeah, I noticed some wire
came loose from your pole,

334
00:15:05,637 --> 00:15:07,205
so I disconnected it
in the attic.

335
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:08,539
You know, loose wires
can be dangerous.

336
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:11,643
Well, you really can just
let me know next time.

337
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:13,912
(CHUCKLING) I'm just so used
to taking care of the place.

338
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:15,513
It's like
second nature now.

339
00:15:15,513 --> 00:15:17,582
Well, thanks.
I'll see you later.

340
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:19,350
Well, Susan asked me
for lunch.

341
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:21,653
Well, come on in.

342
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,656
GARY: Hi, sweetie.
Hi.

343
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,026
Where are you going?
I'm so sorry.

344

for him

spiritual guidance.

He wants to do
the right thing.

1042
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:19,688
He called after he knew
he was going to be arrested.

1043
00:54:20,725 --> 00:54:22,625
He's cooperated
with the police

1044

what he's done.

what he did

to me and my family?

Not exactly.

1051
00:54:36,605 --> 00:54:39,708
The charge was burglary,
but what did he take?

1052

Videos.

1053
00:54:44,015 --> 00:54:47,650
He made videotapes of us
in our bedroom and bathroom

1054
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:49,018
with a hidden camera
in the attic.

1055
00:54:53,557 --> 00:54:56,492
So he's crossed some very
inappropriate boundaries.

and you're angry,

Nancy and the boys.

be dragged through the mud.

will be merciless.

you were raped or robbed.

Besides, there's always
two sides to every story.

Ask yourself why Steve was
so obsessed with you.

1071
00:55:42,504 --> 00:55:43,739
Maybe you were
leading him on.

1383
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:48,483
(SOBBING)

1384
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:56,691
I left you a dozen messages.
Why won't you call back?

1385
01:14:56,691 --> 01:14:58,059
It's not you.

1386
01:14:59,062 --> 01:15:00,495
I just don't
feel like talkin'.

1387
01:15:01,498 --> 01:15:03,898
You know, no energy.

1388
01:15:03,898 --> 01:15:06,267
Well, the best way to
energize is exercise.

1389
01:15:08,071 --> 01:15:09,737
When are you
gonna run again?

1390
01:15:09,737 --> 01:15:11,005
Oh, I don't know.

1391
01:15:13,643 --> 01:15:14,876
I can't stand the thought of
people starin' at me.

1392
01:15:14,876 --> 01:15:16,043
It just...

1393
01:15:16,043 --> 01:15:18,779
Nobody is starin' at you.

1394
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,717
Do you know what Steve's
been spreadin' around?

1395
01:15:22,717 --> 01:15:24,118
I don't care.

1396
01:15:24,118 --> 01:15:25,853
He is tellin' the world
how you hit on him,

1397
01:15:26,789 --> 01:15:27,955
callin' on his cellphone,

1398
01:15:27,955 --> 01:15:30,057
prancin' around
in your skimpy lingerie,

1399
01:15:30,057 --> 01:15:31,893
spaghetti straps with
Aztec print, no less.

1400
01:15:31,893 --> 01:15:34,095
I mean, what red-blooded man
could resist?

1401
01:15:34,095 --> 01:15:35,930
(SCOFFS) How bizarre!

1402
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:38,566
You know,
maybe in some demented way,

1403
01:15:38,566 --> 01:15:41,002
he honestly believes
you had an affair.

1404
01:15:41,002 --> 01:15:42,303
Do other people
believe him?

1405
01:15:42,805 --> 01:15:44,839
Some.

1406
01:15:44,839 --> 01:15:46,741
He is out there
selling his story

1407
01:15:46,741 --> 01:15:48,309
while you're
fallin' apart in here.

1408
01:15:48,309 --> 01:15:49,911
For all
you know right now,

1409
01:15:49,911 --> 01:15:52,146
he is videotapin' some other
unsuspecting family.

1410
01:15:53,249 --> 01:15:54,682
He wouldn't dare.

1411
01:15:54,682 --> 01:15:56,367
Sure, he would.

1412
01:15:56,367 --> 01:15:58,051
He's not sufferin' any,
you've cornered the market.

1413
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:01,856
I just thought
when it happened

1414
01:16:01,856 --> 01:16:02,957
to other people that...

1415
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,760
They'd be upset, too.

1416
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:06,961
They'd be angry, too.

1417
01:16:08,097 --> 01:16:09,330
But they don't even
want to know about it.

1418
01:16:10,967 --> 01:16:13,167
What's wrong with me
that I can't get past this?

1419
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:15,603
(SNIFFLES)

1420
01:16:15,603 --> 01:16:17,138
Even you think
I should be over it!

1421
01:16:17,138 --> 01:16:17,888
No!

1422
01:16:19,091 --> 01:16:21,041
I think you should
make him accountable!

1423
01:16:21,041 --> 01:16:23,711
And you are the only one
who can do that, Susan!

1424
01:16:23,711 --> 01:16:25,246
I've already
called the police.

1425
01:16:25,246 --> 01:16:28,716
Then you try
the district attorney,

1426
01:16:28,716 --> 01:16:30,318
and if that doesn't work,
you try somethin' else.

1427
01:16:34,724 --> 01:16:35,974
Okay.

1428
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:38,759
DISTRICT ATTORNEY: If a peeping
Tom looked through your window,

1429
01:16:38,759 --> 01:16:40,361
I could prosecute,
no problem.

1430
01:16:40,361 --> 01:16:41,996
Isn't this
the same thing?

1431
01:16:41,996 --> 01:16:44,065
No, because he used
video equipment.

1432
01:16:45,201 --> 01:16:47,001
But aren't there laws
against recording people

1433
01:16:47,001 --> 01:16:48,235
without their knowledge?

1434
01:16:48,235 --> 01:16:50,004
That only applies
to recording with sound.

1435
01:16:50,004 --> 01:16:51,772
There's no sound
on the tapes in custody.

1436
01:16:51,772 --> 01:16:53,374
What difference
does sound make?

1437
01:16:53,374 --> 01:16:55,776
Well, there is a law in
the books against wiretapping.

1438
01:16:55,776 --> 01:16:58,379
There's no law
against videotaping.

1439
01:16:58,379 --> 01:17:00,681
The laws just haven't
kept up with technology.

1440
01:17:00,681 --> 01:17:03,050
But he taped us
without our permission.

1441
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:06,821
He doesn't need it because
he didn't do anything illegal.

1442
01:17:06,821 --> 01:17:09,190
Videotaping people with
or without their knowledge

1443
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:11,025
is not a crime
in the state of Louisiana,

1444
01:17:11,025 --> 01:17:12,226
or most of the U.S.,
for that matter.

1445
01:17:12,226 --> 01:17:14,128
So what he did is okay?

1446
01:17:14,128 --> 01:17:16,097
He destroys our lives,
and that's not a crime?

1447
01:17:16,097 --> 01:17:17,932
Not the videotaping.

1448
01:17:17,932 --> 01:17:20,901
I could charge him
with unauthorized entry

1449
01:17:20,901 --> 01:17:22,937
or destruction of property
for the holes he drilled.

1450
01:17:24,173 --> 01:17:25,940
The downside to that is,

1451
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:28,743
he could play those
videotapes in open court,

1452
01:17:28,743 --> 01:17:31,212
and I'll guarantee you, the
defense is counting on that fact

1453
01:17:31,212 --> 01:17:32,413
to make you back off.

1454
01:17:33,883 --> 01:17:35,650
I know it's unfair.

1455
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:37,084
Unfair?

1456
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:39,353
It's insane!

1457
01:17:39,353 --> 01:17:41,255
If I was mugged, they
wouldn't mug me again in court

1458
01:17:41,255 --> 01:17:42,757
for the purpose
of demonstration.

1459
01:17:42,757 --> 01:17:45,026
If we pursue this
in criminal court,

1460
01:17:45,026 --> 01:17:46,227
what do you think
will happen to him?

1461
01:17:47,664 --> 01:17:49,397
Not much.

1462
01:17:49,397 --> 01:17:51,999
He won't do any time
if it's his first offense.

1463
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:55,369
The best you should hope for
is probation and a stiff fine.

1464
01:17:58,174 --> 01:18:01,175
Would he have to admit
he did something wrong?

1465
01:18:01,175 --> 01:18:02,343
I don't see how
he could avoid it.

1466
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:06,013
Well, that'll have
to be enough, then.

1467
01:18:06,013 --> 01:18:08,149
And what if they don't punish
him at all, even if you win?

1468
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:11,786
It's not about
punishing him exactly.

1469
01:18:13,923 --> 01:18:15,289
It's about healing us.

1470
01:18:19,829 --> 01:18:22,296
How did Mrs. Wilson obtain
the tape she made a copy of?

1471
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,032
She obtained
the original tape

1472
01:18:25,032 --> 01:18:26,867
from the residence
of Mr. Glover.

1473
01:18:26,867 --> 01:18:27,902
Was Mr. Glover there?

1474
01:18:28,971 --> 01:18:30,671
HOLT: I don't think so.

1475
01:18:30,671 --> 01:18:32,372
So, she entered the Glover
house without permission

1476
01:18:32,372 --> 01:18:34,308
exactly as she alleges
my client did.

1477
01:18:34,308 --> 01:18:35,726
Yes. But...

1478
01:18:35,726 --> 01:18:37,143
You mentioned that
a couple of tapes

1479
01:18:37,143 --> 01:18:39,213
were burned or destroyed,
when did that occur?

1480
01:18:40,083 --> 01:18:41,949
Sometime after June 29th.

1481
01:18:41,949 --> 01:18:43,718
Where did that occur?

1482
01:18:43,718 --> 01:18:46,053
Some property being
farmed by Mr. Glover.

1483
01:18:46,053 --> 01:18:47,254
Did y'all recover
any of those items?

1484
01:18:48,991 --> 01:18:50,091
We did not.

1485
01:18:54,464 --> 01:18:56,764
(DOOR OPENS)

1486
01:18:56,764 --> 01:18:59,065
Well, the good news is
Glover's coppin' a plea,

1487
01:18:59,065 --> 01:19:01,435
so that means no public
screening of your videotape.

1488
01:19:02,138 --> 01:19:04,238
The bad news is

1489
01:19:04,238 --> 01:19:07,508
no more discovery,
no sworn testimony,

1490
01:19:07,508 --> 01:19:09,243
no real record
of what he actually did.

1491
01:19:09,243 --> 01:19:10,911
What's he pleading to?

1492
01:19:10,911 --> 01:19:13,047
Unauthorized entry to
an inhabited dwelling,

1493
01:19:13,883 --> 01:19:15,416
three years'
supervised parole

1494
01:19:15,416 --> 01:19:17,151
and $2,000 restitution
to you folks

1495
01:19:17,151 --> 01:19:19,787
for the damage
to your home.

1496
01:19:19,787 --> 01:19:22,189
The punishment has absolutely
no relation to the crime.

1497
01:19:22,189 --> 01:19:24,058
Couldn't agree more,

1498
01:19:24,058 --> 01:19:26,761
but video voyeurism isn't
addressed by our legal system.

1499
01:19:27,797 --> 01:19:29,930
Look, I know
that you're tryin' to

1500
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:31,398
protect your privacy
and your family.

1501
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:34,368
But if you could tell
your story,

1502
01:19:34,368 --> 01:19:36,103
put a name and a face to
what happened in the media,

1503
01:19:36,103 --> 01:19:37,872
it might make a difference.

1504
01:19:37,872 --> 01:19:40,341
There's gonna be more and
more of these cases, you know,

1505
01:19:40,341 --> 01:19:42,176
I mean, anybody can buy
a video camera

1506
01:19:42,176 --> 01:19:44,044
the size of a pencil lead,

1507
01:19:44,044 --> 01:19:46,280
and the Internet
gives people ideas,

1508
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:49,383
and it's got a great,
big appetite for your privacy.

1509
01:19:49,383 --> 01:19:51,552
Now you're only
one of the victims,

1510
01:19:51,552 --> 01:19:54,922
but I think that people
just may listen to you.

1511
01:19:54,922 --> 01:19:56,791
Do you really think a law
would be passed quicker

1512
01:19:56,791 --> 01:19:58,893
if I came forward and told
about what happened to us?

1513
01:19:58,893 --> 01:20:00,127
You mean go public?

1514
01:20:00,127 --> 01:20:01,562
Relive it over
and over again?

1515
01:20:01,562 --> 01:20:03,197
Maybe it could be
a good thing.

1516
01:20:03,197 --> 01:20:04,298
When he pleads
guilty tomorrow,

1517
01:20:04,298 --> 01:20:06,334
that'll be the end of it,

1518
01:20:06,334 --> 01:20:08,369
unless you do go public
and keep this thing alive.

1519
01:20:08,369 --> 01:20:10,371
At least you'll know that
the next time it happens,

1520
01:20:10,371 --> 01:20:11,472
it'll be a punishable crime.

1521
01:20:12,341 --> 01:20:14,408
I don't know. It...

1522
01:20:14,408 --> 01:20:15,976
GARY: Susan, up to now,

1523
01:20:15,976 --> 01:20:19,246
the press has respected
your wishes.

1524
01:20:19,246 --> 01:20:22,483
You go public,
you can't take it back.

1525
01:20:29,025 --> 01:20:32,092
So, if I do get involved
in getting a law passed,

1526
01:20:32,092 --> 01:20:34,461
that might mean
some more changes.

1527
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:39,000
ORIN: Like what?

1528
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,934
Well, it would take up
a lot more of my time,

1529
01:20:41,437 --> 01:20:45,873
and, um, we'd have to
deal with the press,

1530
01:20:45,873 --> 01:20:47,508
and I won't put us through
that if you don't want me to.

1531
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:51,846
It would make me
really proud.

1532
01:20:56,886 --> 01:20:58,886
Good night, you.
Good night.

1533
01:21:00,156 --> 01:21:01,455
Mom...

1534
01:21:01,455 --> 01:21:03,157
Are you nervous
about tomorrow?

1535
01:21:04,493 --> 01:21:06,427
Not really.

1536
01:21:06,427 --> 01:21:09,163
I'm kind of looking forward
to hearing him plead guilty.

1537
01:21:09,163 --> 01:21:11,031
Even if it's in
the papers and on TV?

1538
01:21:13,102 --> 01:21:14,168
Would that be so bad?

1539
01:21:16,272 --> 01:21:19,139
Yes, I hate when people
gossip about me.

1540
01:21:19,139 --> 01:21:20,507
Yeah, I know exactly
how you feel.

1541
01:21:22,345 --> 01:21:24,011
But that may be the only way

1542
01:21:24,011 --> 01:21:25,045
to bring out the truth.

1543
01:21:26,349 --> 01:21:27,882
What about your reputation?

1544
01:21:30,286 --> 01:21:31,619
Well, a lot of times,

1545
01:21:31,619 --> 01:21:34,355
reputations don't have
anything to do with reality,

1546
01:21:34,355 --> 01:21:38,125
like with Mr. Glover,
he's a perfect example.

1547
01:21:38,125 --> 01:21:39,894
And if I had to do it
all over again,

1548
01:21:41,631 --> 01:21:44,431
I wouldn't care what people
thought of me,

1549
01:21:44,431 --> 01:21:46,300
and I wouldn't try to
get people to like me.

1550
01:21:47,904 --> 01:21:49,403
I'd just learn to
stand up for myself.
