Buon compleanno, Nonna Campisi.

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,790
Grazie,

19
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,658
everyone.

20
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:00,692
This...

21
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,462
This is so nice.

22
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:07,399
Antonio, the pasta was perfetto.

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,668
Just like my Marco used to make.

24
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:10,637
He taught you well.

25
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:12,304
- Bravo!
- I am so glad

26
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:13,605
you like it, Signora.

27
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:14,840
It means the world to me.

28
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,875
And look at this cake.

29
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:17,910
Magnifico!

30
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:18,911
Make a wish.

31
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,318
Ah!

32
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:35,527
Did it work?

33
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:36,528
You've always been

34
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:37,529
young at heart, Nonna.

35
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,565
I tried.

36
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,234
Well, happy birthday, Nonna.
Enjoy your cake.

37
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,235
Buon compleanno, Nonna.

38
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,308
I made you
some giandiotto chocolates

39
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,943
with fresh hazelnuts
from my family's orchard.

40
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,213
Grazie, Ginny.

41
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:58,317
Your friend
is always so thoughtful.

42
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,518
I don't know

43
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,353
what I would do without her.

44
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:02,322
And I don't know what I would do

45
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,289
without you, Nonna.

46
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,757
Marco was so happy

47
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,918
when you decided to follow him
from Italy to open Cibo.

48
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,797
And I am so grateful
that you stayed,

49
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,632
even after he passed away.

50
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,369
Well, you are my family.

51
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,639
I am not going anywhere.

52
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,478
Your pastry chef really
outdid herself on this one.

53
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:28,580
Actually...

54
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:32,451
Christina called in sick today,
so I made the cake myself.

55
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,485
Seriously?

56
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,720
It's so good!

57
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,755
I had no idea
you could bake like this.

58
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,624
Remember, I told you
I used to bake all the time

59
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,858
with my mom back in Connecticut.

60
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,560
I really loved it.

61
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,295
Why don't you do it more?

62
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,963
I don't know,
I don't really have the time.

63
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:48,168
Managing the restaurant,
Sofia, life...

64
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,503
Richard! You made it.

65
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,704
We saved you some cake.

66
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:53,739
Ah.

67
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,340
Thank you.

68
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,975
Happy birthday, Signora Campisi.

69
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:57,976
Grazie.

70
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:00,879
Can we talk privately?

71
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,781
Of course.

72
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:03,982
I'll be right back.

73
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:04,983
Thank you.

74
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:12,658
Doh je.

75
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:14,726
Doh je.

76
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:16,929
Doh je.

77
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,331
Okay.

78
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,734
Doh je.

79
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,738
I can never
thank you enough, Ben.

80
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,040
You brought us back
from the brink.

81
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,042
Just doing my job.

82
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,979
Okay.

83
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,561
Hey, Jared.
We're all set here.

84
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,063
So I heard.

85
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,465
Great job, as always.

86
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,767
So, now you want to take
a little time,

87
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,769
see Hong Kong before you leave?

88
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,004
Didn't come to Hong Kong
for a vacation, Jared.

89
00:03:59,005 --> 00:03:59,973
Came to turn around
a restaurant.

90
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:01,740
I did that.

91
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,308
Everyone needs a break
at some point, Ben.

92
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,409
Where to next?

93
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,477
I just got a call

94
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:06,678
from Richard Maitlin.

95
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:09,781
He's majority owner
of Il Cibo è Vita

96
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:12,551
on Bainbridge Island,
near Seattle.

97
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,553
They opened up the place
about ten years ago

98
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,455
after discovering
this incredible chef

99
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,023
from Italy,

100
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,558
and instant smash.

101
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,660
Two Michelin stars
within the first year,

102
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,362
six-week wait for a table.

103
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,697
Doesn't sound like
they need my help.

104
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,467
Well, that was before
Chef Campisi passed away.

105
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,069
It's been about
th ree years now,

106
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,739
and they're struggling.

107
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,708
Yeah. That's a tough one
to come back from.

108
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:41,013
He's hired us to see if we can
still salvage what they have

109
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,014
before he has to sell.

110
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,849
I'll see what I can do.

111
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,751
I assume everybody involved
is on board with the process?

112
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:46,719
Of course.

113
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,387
Great.

114
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,656
Hang on. Hang on.

115
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,625
So we're gonna let this person
who we've never met,

116
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,028
who never met Marco,

117
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,063
just swoop in here,
and turn everything upside-down?

118
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,798
No, he's gonna
turn things around.

119
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,533
This guy has got
a 100% track record.

120
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,669
He's the best in the business.

121
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,370
You should be excited.

122
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,806
Well, if by "excited" you mean
"sense of impending doom,"

123
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,474
you bet.

124
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,576
I'm sorry, Elizabeth,
but I don't have a choice.

125
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,679
Cibo has to start
turning a profit again,

126
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,780
or I'm gonna have
to sell my shares.

127
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,082
It's a business decision.

128
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,384
This is not just a business.

129
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,919
It's a family.

130
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,921
And it's a family
you helped create

131
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,857
when you brought Marco here
all those years ago.

132
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,126
I know.

133
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:31,163
Watching the restaurant
take off,

134
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,532
seeing you two fall in love,
have Sofia...

135
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,101
I'm so proud I even had
a little to do with that.

136
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,669
And you know
I've done everything I can

137
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,004
to keep these doors open.

138
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,072
I know. I do know that.

139
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,040
And I appreciate it.

140
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,910
But I'm a real-estate investor,
Elizabeth.

141
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,578
I never planned on
owning a restaurant,

142
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:50,015
but I took a chance because...

143
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,083
I knew Marco was special.

144
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,119
He was.

145
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,123
And everything he created
is still here.

146
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,026
What if this person
wants to come in here

147
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,994
and take all of that away?

148
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,097
He's not the enemy, Elizabeth.

149
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,500
He's coming to help.

150
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,206
What's that?

151
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,975
Peach and almond crostata.

152
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,144
That's a solid "yum."
When are you gonna make it?

153
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,114
One day, I will find the time.

154
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,015
The good news is,

155
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:25,617
I made sure
we had plenty of time

156
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:27,686
to go to
the Artisan Festival today.

157
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,121
I thought
we could get there early

158
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,622
and do a little shopping,

159
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,024
then go visit Ginny
at her booth.

160
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:35,927
What's wrong?
Don't you want to go?

161
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,596
It's not
that I don't want to go,

162
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,698
it's just Anna texted me to see

163
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,033
if I wanted to hang out
with her and Mia there,

164
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,068
and then go
to Anna's house after.

165
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,603
Oh.

166
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:45,904
Are you mad?

167
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,473
No, I am not mad.

168
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,743
Of course, you should go
with your friends.

169
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,579
The festival goes for two weeks,
so we can go another time.

170
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,580
Thanks, Mom.

171
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,517
Sure.

172
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,554
I am so sorry, sir,

173
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,923
but your room won't be ready
for another hour.

174
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,792
Oh. That's okay.

175
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,193
While you're waiting,

176
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,962
might I suggest walking over
to the Artisan Festival?

177
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:14,566
It's a wonderful event
and today's the first day.

178
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,636
Okay. Yeah.
I'll check it out. Why not?

179
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:18,637
Thanks.

180
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,305
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

181
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,674
I just wanted to see
how it was going so far.

182
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,043
Great. Everyone really seems
to like the new fudge.

183
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,212
Where's Sof?

184
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,214
She's off with her friends.

185
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,182
Didn't want to come with me.

186
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,217
Oh...

187
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,785
Don't worry.

188
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:07,853
She'll magically reappear
once she gets hungry.

189
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,254
I know it's hard, El,

190
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,689
but she's getting
more independent...

191
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,091
It's a good thing,
means she's growing up.

192
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,793
Tch.

193
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,329
You are a good friend.

194
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,698
- Hi there.
- Hi.

195
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,868
Would you like to try a sample?
This is our new hazelnut fudge.

196
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,203
Every ingredient
comes right from the island.

197
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:28,006
This is literally the best
chocolate in the entire country.

198
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,708
Okay.

199
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,710
Ginny's family's been
making this since the 1920s.

200
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:32,944
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.

201
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,846
Hundred-year-old chocolate?
Looks great.

202
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,082
It's a life-altering experience.

203
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,785
Okay, might be overselling it
a little bit now.

204
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,621
You are being kind of pushy.

205
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,089
I'm just trying to help.

206
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,724
No, no. It worked.

207
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,194
Just fair warning,
I'm not a "hazelnut" guy.

208
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,196
Until now.

209
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,698
- Can I get a bag?
- Yes.

210
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,033
- How much do I owe you?
- Ten.

211
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,201
Did I tell you,
or did I tell you?

212
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,669
You told me.

213
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,237
I hope you're paying
your friend a commission.

214
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,671
Of course.

215
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:00,806
Mm. Winner.

216
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,243
You grow up here?

217
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,811
Ginny did.

218
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:09,981
Actually, we met as freshmen
at UConn.

219
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,750
Loudest roommate ever.

220
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,319
Well, I had to be loud
to drown out your ukulele.

221
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,054
No, you didn't.

222
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:19,124
Oh, it's okay.
No shame. No shame here.

223
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,226
I, too, also went through
an ironic-ukulele phase.

224
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,260
How many songs you learn?

225
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,229
Uh, one.

226
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,931
"What a Wonderful World."

227
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,232
How did you know that?

228
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,335
It's the only song I learned.

229
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:32,238
Hey, Ginny.

230
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,672
Hi!

231
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,575
Wow. This is
a friendly place, huh?

232
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,910
Yeah, that was one of
the first things I noticed

233
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,179
when I came here to visit Ginny
on a road trip 13 years ago.

234
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,081
It's a really special place.

235
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,816
Pretty much
as soon as I got here,

236
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,284
I knew this is where I belonged.

237
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,786
The free chocolate
doesn't hurt, though, right?

238
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:48,421
Well, obviously.

239
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,921
Here you go.

240
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,056
Thank you.
Oh, keep that.

241
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,390
Oh, thanks.

242
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:55,026
Just try not to eat all that
in one sitting.

243
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,696
Oh, I absolutely will.

244
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,098
Oh. Ginny?

245
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,733
I gotta go.
I got a meeting.

246
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:02,834
I got a meeting, too, actually.

247
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,803
It was a pleasure meeting you.

248
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,071
Yeah, you too.

249
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,305
Thank you for the chocolate.

250
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,840
Of course.

251
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:09,976
- You guys take care.
- Bye.

252
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,678
Okay. Wish me luck.

253
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,213
I have to go meet

254
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,315
with this restaurant consultant
that Richard recommended.

255
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,883
You can't leave yet.

256
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,685
We haven't even talked
about ukulele guy.

257
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,287
There's nothing to talk about.

258
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,168
I was trying to help
my best friend make a sale.

259
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,059
If we have to close Cibo,
will you hire me?

260
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,429
Yes. But I know
I'm not gonna have to.

261
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,300
Good luck.

262
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:02,728
Hey.

263
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,729
Me again.

264
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,431
You look lost.

265
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,333
Yeah. Yeah, I got
a special talent

266
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,467
for starting out
in the wrong direction

267
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,769
using this walking app.

268
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,103
Well, I can probably help you.

269
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,238
Where are you going?

270
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,073
Uh, Il Cibo è Vita.

271
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,775
You know it?

272
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,444
Of... course I do.

273
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,446
Everyone does.

274
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,348
I mean, it's probably

275
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,117
the best Italian restaurant
in the Pacific Northwest.

276
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,153
I mean, maybe even
the entire country.

277
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,821
Okay. Well...

278
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,090
I was told it used to be.

279
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,825
Straight down that way,
turn left,

280
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:34,946
two doors down on the right.

281
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,312
Can I help you?

282
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,185
You're Elizabeth Campisi.

283
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,053
I am.

284
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,789
And Marco Campisi
was my husband.

285
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,391
I'm so sorry for your loss.

286
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,559
There's nothing harder.

287
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,360
Thank you.

288
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,863
And I want to apologize
if I was harsh back there.

289
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,565
I didn't mean to imply
that Cibo was not good.

290
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,934
Well, you didn't imply it.

291
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,136
You flat-out said it.

292
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,538
To be fair, you could've
told me who you were.

293
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,240
I guess I wanted to see
what I was up against

294
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,009
and now I know.

295
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,850
Ms. Campisi?

296
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,384
I'm here to help.

297
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,053
Believe it or not,
I'm on your side.

298
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,989
Together, you and I can
help Cibo find its way again.

299
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,358
By changing everything about it
that made it great?

300
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,599
By identifying the things
that might be holding you back.

301
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,964
And what if, when you're done,

302
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,532
there's nothing left?

303
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,435
I promised Marco that I would
keep his vision alive,

304
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,403
and keep
our Cibo family together.

305
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,939
Everyone here is counting on me.

306
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,009
Look, I've been doing this
a very long time.

307
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,111
Believe me when I say
that I understand

308
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,613
that the restaurant
is not just brick and mortar,

309
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,148
it's your heart and your soul.

310
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,850
Yes.
And so is everyone inside it.

311
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,118
I won't forget that.

312
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,987
Okay.

313
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:13,258
So, do I just tell my staff
you're in charge now, or what?

314
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,426
No, no. You just keep doing
what you normally do.

315
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,395
I'll be observing the front
and the back of the house

316
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:20,198
until I get an understanding
of what I'm dealing with here.

317
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,467
What you're "dealing with"

318
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,602
is the vision of Marco Campisi,

319
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:28,039
the greatest chef to ever
come out of Northern Italy.

320
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,276
Ben, this is, uh, Chef Antonio.

321
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,311
He came here to Bainbridge
with Marco all those years ago,

322
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,246
as his protege.

323
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,282
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Antonio.

324
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,218
I've heard wonderful things
about you from Richard.

325
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,220
I gotta say,
I admire your willingness

326
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,556
to stay faithful
to Marco's original recipes...

327
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:45,357
It's a stand-up thing to do.

328
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:48,027
Everything I am,
I owe to that man.

329
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,429
It's the least I can do.

330
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,465
Well, I am very excited
to try everything for myself.

331
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,900
What do you say we start

332
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:56,935
with three of
Cibo's best-selling dishes?

333
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,203
- Yeah?
- Right now?

334
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,505
Right now.
No time like the present.

335
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,473
I'm not sure we'll have time
before the dinner rush.

336
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,675
I wouldn't call it
a "rush."

337
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,077
Carla.

338
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,479
You know, I think
we can make that work...

339
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,720
- Good.
- If we start right away.

340
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,320
Good afternoon, everybody.

341
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,188
My name is Ben Elliott,

342
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,923
and my job is simply

343
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:21,092
to help restaurants
reach their full potential.

344
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,660
Now, without sounding too proud,

345
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,963
I have had some success
all over the world,

346
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,065
and there's no reason why
we can't do the same thing here,

347
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,399
with a beautiful place
like Cibo.

348
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,102
Is he waiting for us to cheer
or something?

349
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,171
I can hear you.

350
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:37,308
Uh... I think he might
actually be here to help,

351
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:40,178
so, let's give him a chance,
okay, guys?

352
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,579
Thank you.

353
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,947
Antonio,
you want to get us going?

354
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:43,982
Okay, everyone,

355
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,416
we'll start with the antipasti...

356
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,517
Go prepare the bruschetta.

357
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,586
I'll get started
on the carne cruda.

358
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,421
I want everyone else either
on prep or out of the way.

359
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,057
Adesso!
Let's go!

360
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,394
Thanks, everybody.
I appreciate it. Thank you.

361
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,275
Coagulated before
you put it in the pasta, okay?

362
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,318
Most of our guests
begin with the antipasti board...

363
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:24,156
Bruschetta, carne cruda,
piave cheese.

364
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:26,557
Here is
a butternut squash risotto...

365
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:27,759
All of the squash

366
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,727
is sourced locally
here on the island.

367
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:32,130
Next up,
we have a customer favorite...

368
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:36,067
Fresh lobster ravioli
with crabmeat cream sauce.

369
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:39,404
Finally,
Marco's signature dish...

370
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:43,007
This is tagliolini with
a sun-dried tomato pesto.

371
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,611
It's an homage to his roots
in Northwest Italy.

372
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,518
Mm. Hmm.

373
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,521
It's incredible, isn't it?

374
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,423
Yeah, it's delicious.
Absolutely.

375
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,125
The tomatoes are flown in,
direct from Piemonte.

376
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,193
Italy?

377
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,528
That seems incredibly expensive

378
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,129
for something
you can source locally, no?

379
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,332
Well, the thing is, this dish,

380
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,234
including
these particular tomatoes,

381
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,570
this is what made Marco famous.

382
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,974
So we can't change it.

383
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,577
Promise me
you won't ask me to change it.

384
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:23,214
Well, I can't make any promises,

385
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,717
but I'll do my best
to make it work.

386
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,453
The other thing here
is I see that the tomatoes

387
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:29,620
are being used on...

388
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,656
five other dishes

389
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,791
that aren't selling
nearly as well.

390
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,394
The best thing we can do here
is to simplify this entire menu.

391
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,162
Or maybe we can just get rid
of the whole thing

392
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,497
and serve spaghetti
with sauce from a can?

393
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,065
That would save lots of money.

394
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,800
We will take a look

395
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,270
at our sun-dried tomato
expenditures.

396
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:47,539
Thank you.

397
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:52,143
Is this the way the tables
have always been arranged?

398
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,411
Yes.

399
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,446
Huh.

400
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,181
What are you writing?

401
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,717
It's just shorthand,
so I remember my thoughts.

402
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,786
So you're having thoughts
that you aren't sharing with me?

403
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,287
Because I would like
to hear them...

404
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,089
if we're "in this together."

405
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,824
We are. We are.

406
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,393
I've just found it best

407
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,161
not to hit my clients
with all the ideas at once.

408
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,596
Tends to make 'em
feel overwhelmed.

409
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,166
I've already been overwhelmed
for the last three years.

410
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,538
Elizabeth, can you and I
go talk somewhere alone?

411
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,507
- That's a good idea.
- Okay.

412
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,442
This way.

413
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,349
Oh, Nonna.

414
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,153
This is Ben Elliott.

415
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,855
He's the restaurant consultant
that I was telling you about.

416
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,892
This is Marco's mother,
Signora Campisi.

417
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,727
It's an honor to meet you.

418
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,595
I'm so sorry
for the loss of your son.

419
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,364
Not as sorry as you will be

420
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,667
if you try to change
the tagliolini recipe.

421
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,602
You heard us talking about that?

422
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:52,738
Sì.

423
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,340
I won't change it.

424
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:57,676
You have my word.

425
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,345
Grazie.

426
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,848
Well, enjoy your dinner, Nonna.

427
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:07,351
So I thought you said
you couldn't make promises.

428
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,621
I know.
But that was kind of scary.

429
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,363
Can we just start over?

430
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,166
Please.

431
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,636
Let's go for a walk.

432
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,540
So, how did you end up
doing this for a living?

433
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,577
Uh, in college,
I worked at a restaurant

434
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,745
that was struggling
to keep its doors open.

435
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,647
I came up with a few good ideas.

436
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,382
They listened, it worked.

437
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:39,917
The success
got a lot of attention,

438
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,819
and I guess I found my calling.

439
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,822
Did you ever want to open
a restaurant of your own?

440
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:48,759
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Almost did.
Yeah, San Diego.

441
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,261
Didn't work out.

442
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:54,198
Listen, um,
as far as Cibo's concerned,

443
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,733
we're just gonna concentrate
on the things

444
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,768
that, uh, that made it special,
you know?

445
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,904
You're speaking
in the past-tense again.

446
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,906
It is special.

447
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,374
Yeah, listen.

448
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,243
You're absolutely right.

449
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,445
Okay?

450
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,714
We just need to get people
to find a reason to come back,

451
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:10,816
see it for themselves.

452
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,519
Well, then let's get started.

453
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,488
Good. Come on.

454
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,231
Your turn.

455
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:28,599
No.

456
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,767
Come on.

457
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:30,935
No. You can't wish away

458
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,404
the bad things
that happen in life.

459
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,308
Doesn't stop some people
from trying.

460
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,311
There's a lot of hope
in these coins.

461
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:43,749
Doesn't hurt to put it out
in the universe.

462
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:55,960
There. Did it.

463
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,395
- You happy?
- Yes.

464
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,497
So happy.

465
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,300
Unless you wished for me
to get sucked into a black hole

466
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,135
or something awful like that.

467
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:04,802
You know what,
I thought about it.

468
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,537
But then how would I explain
that to the authorities?

469
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,740
Yeah, how would you?

470
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:13,579
Nah. I just wished
for everything to be okay.

471
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,219
Well, there.
Now your wish got some backup.

472
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,054
Thank you.

473
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,990
Just here to help.

474
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:39,937
What's the matter?

475
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,806
Nothing.

476
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,842
Sweetheart. I can tell
there's something's wrong.

477
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,446
Come here.
Come talk to me.

478
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,481
It's just...

479
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,416
I found out that Anna and Mia

480
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,318
didn't really want to invite me
to the festival.

481
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,387
Anna's mom made her

482
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,456
because she still
feels sorry for me.

483
00:20:58,457 --> 00:20:59,657
For us.

484
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,627
Oh... Sof.

485
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,595
And the worst part is,

486
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,998
I don't even know if I want
to be friends with them anymore.

487
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,066
What? Why not?

488
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,801
We sit together at lunch,

489
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,904
and she and Mia don't even
look up from their phones.

490
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:16,675
And the dumbest part is,
they're texting each other.

491
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,111
I just wish everything
was the way it used to be.

492
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,346
Mm.

493
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,082
I know.

494
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,286
I wish that, too.

495
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:32,923
But things don't always go
the way we planned.

496
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:37,429
I think you and I know that
better than anyone, don't we?

497
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,133
I bet there are a lot of girls
at your school

498
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,535
who would love
to get to know you better.

499
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,404
Yeah, until I tell them
about Dad,

500
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,407
and they give me the "sad" look.

501
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:55,514
Then we are just gonna have
to show them we are doing fine.

502
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,983
Okay?

503
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:02,987
We should also consider

504
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,022
starting an aperitivo hour
with wine pairings.

505
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,924
But I thought you wanted
to streamline the menu.

506
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,559
Yes, to make room

507
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,662
for new specials
that are easy to promote.

508
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,531
And before you go blind
trying to read what I wrote,

509
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:14,732
what I wrote was,

510
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,701
"open-concept kitchen... "
question mark.

511
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,536
Open-concept kitchen?

512
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,438
- That's right.
- Marco used to say

513
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:23,040
open kitchens make him feel like
an exhibit at the zoo...

514
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,142
Like a monkey with knives
and a white hat.

515
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,844
Okay. Well, look.

516
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,846
I've had the pleasure of
watching you cook, Antonio...

517
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,815
And you've got
a rhythm and a flow.

518
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,583
It's like watching a conductor
with a symphony.

519
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:34,418
Why not let people be a part of
something beautiful like that?

520
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,053
It's just not what Marco wanted.

521
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:37,788
Excuse me,
I need to get more olive oil.

522
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,423
Hey, what do you mean?
Where's the rest of it?

523
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,025
Well, I was supposed
to get it yesterday,

524
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,560
but after making
the menu samples for Ben,

525
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:43,694
I didn't get the chance.

526
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,162
Who's your supplier?

527
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:46,764
Signore Petrunti.

528
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:49,100
He's not an official supplier,
per se...

529
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:52,002
He's a friend of Nonna Campisi's
from the old country

530
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:54,638
and his olive oil
is the best of the best.

531
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,507
- I'll run out.
- Actually, no.

532
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,942
It's almost your break.

533
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,044
Um, we'll just go.

534
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:01,780
Are you sure?

535
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,982
You know what you have to do?

536
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:07,718
I know.

537
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,887
I'll be fine.

538
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,691
Come on.

539
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:18,929
So...

540
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,098
what exactly do you have to do
to get this special olive oil?

541
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,501
Well, Signore Petrunti has

542
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,136
his own unique way
of doing business.

543
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,406
It's a very delicate
negotiation.

544
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,675
- Okay.
- Just come with me.

545
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,185
- You got to do something.
- Signore.

546
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,416
Elizabeth!

547
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,918
How are you?

548
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,887
Ah, fine, fine.

549
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,221
Where's Antonio?

550
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:45,556
He's at the restaurant.

551
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:46,924
I'll be handling
the order today.

552
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,259
Who's this guy?

553
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,027
I'm Ben. How're you doing?
Nice to meet you.

554
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:51,796
He's just observing.

555
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,265
You know how this works, huh?

556
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,567
The lower your score,
the more you pay.

557
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:57,701
- Capisce?
- Of course.

558
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:59,638
Bene.

559
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,614
Scopa!

560
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,150
Is she winning?

561
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,152
Yes.

562
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:18,890
Scopa!

563
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,270
Scopa!

564
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,007
I'm just getting lucky.

565
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,844
Mm.

566
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:41,779
Here's your price.

567
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,850
No.

568
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,852
That was the price last time,

569
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:51,289
and I know Antonio didn't win
as many rounds as me.

570
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,679
You're good at this, huh?

571
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,883
Go get her a case of olive oil.

572
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,786
Elizabeth, it's a pleasure
doing business with you.

573
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:24,890
We'll see you next month.

574
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:29,193
Is this gonna be enough?

575
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,928
- Grazie.
- Can we have the rest delivered?

576
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,730
Of course.

577
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,733
- Grazie.
- G razie.

578
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,168
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

579
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,070
Okay.

580
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:41,939
That was
a little bit impressive.

581
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,308
Scopa's not that hard to learn.

582
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,809
Not the game!

583
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,810
- The way you charmed those guys.
- Charmed them?

584
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:50,047
And stood your ground
with Signore Petrunti,

585
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,683
and worked him over for...
For his olive oil.

586
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:54,184
Can you do the same thing
with tomatoes, though?

587
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:57,321
See? That's your trouble, Ben.

588
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:01,625
You still think this is
about overhead and profits.

589
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:04,628
Unfortunately, when it's all
said and done, it is.

590
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:06,997
The question is, is how do
we get to where we need to be?

591
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,933
Well, whatever we do,

592
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,368
it can't come at the expense
of what made Cibo great.

593
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,370
It's the relationships.

594
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,839
Everything we do
comes from the heart,

595
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,141
and I don't want to lose that.

596
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:20,110
Otherwise,
what are we even doing here?

597
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:23,280
Aside from basking in the glory
of your sweet, sweet victories?

598
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,149
You know what I mean.

599
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,052
I do.

600
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,120
All right. These bad boys
are nice and safe.

601
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:31,990
Thank you.

602
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,861
Do you want me
to drop you off at home?

603
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:39,129
Or your place,
wherever you're staying?

604
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,298
Yeah, the Bainbridge Pines Inn.

605
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:43,067
If you don't mind.

606
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:46,136
I just realized, I don't even
know where home is for you.

607
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,105
I don't have one of those,
I don't think.

608
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,174
I do have an apartment
in New York,

609
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,976
where I leave all my stuff
when I'm gone.

610
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,277
Does that count?

611
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,045
Don't you ever want
to settle down somewhere?

612
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:57,815
I came close once.

613
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:58,849
When I was engaged.

614
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,251
Didn't work out.

615
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:02,419
Oh. I'm sorry.

616
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,421
Oh, it's fine. It's okay.

617
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:05,890
It's in the past.

618
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:11,028
Don't you get tired,
moving from place to place?

619
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:14,064
No, no. I love what I do.

620
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,467
There are few things better
in this world

621
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,037
than seeing your client realize
that everything's gonna be okay.

622
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,108
Or maybe your job

623
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:27,711
is just an elaborate ruse to get
free food all over the world.

624
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:28,847
Uh-oh. She's on to me.

625
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,088
Sofia, you're gonna
be late for school!

626
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,357
I don't feel good.

627
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:41,326
I don't think I should
go to school today.

628
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,761
Oh, no.

629
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:45,797
Do you have a cough?
A sore throat?

630
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,500
Let me see if you have a fever.

631
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,269
It's just a stomach ache.
I just don't want to go, okay?

632
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,271
Oh.

633
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:57,408
Sofia, did something happen
at school with Anna and Mia?

634
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,777
No. I totally avoided them.

635
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,680
I think maybe
something happened.

636
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,883
Lunch was hard.

637
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:08,152
Mm, yeah. I bet it was.

638
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,187
Who did you end up sitting with?

639
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,389
I went to the art room
and painted.

640
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,091
Sweetheart, I'm sure
there was someone you know

641
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,359
that you could have
had lunch with.

642
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,295
But what if nobody wants me
to sit with them?

643
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,765
Okay. I know this is scary,

644
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:24,835
but, sometimes,
if we want things to change,

645
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,338
we have to be the one
to make the first step.

646
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,389
Good morning.

647
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,424
Good morning!
I'm at the restaurant.

648
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,793
It's locked.

649
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:51,128
Well, that's because
we're closed on Mondays.

650
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,464
Remember?
We give the staff a day off,

651
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,465
because they all work weekends.

652
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,266
Well, that's very kind of you

653
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,569
to be giving up
15% of your potential profit.

654
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,871
This is the way
we've always done it.

655
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,040
It's part of why
the staff is so loyal.

656
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,109
We're like a family.

657
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,977
In fact,
a lot of them come to my house

658
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,245
for Monday Dinner.

659
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,582
Everyone is invited,
and you can...

660
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,485
uh... you can come,

661
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:15,886
if you want.

662
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,354
No, no, no.
I wouldn't want to impose.

663
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,156
I was just
throwing it out there.

664
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:20,457
Then again,
it might not be a bad idea

665
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,593
to get to know the staff
a little bit better.

666
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,528
Never know where a good idea
might come from.

667
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,497
So...

668
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,132
it's like a business dinner.

669
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,400
Yeah. Exactly.

670
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:31,902
Great.

671
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,103
What can I bring?

672
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,173
Pants with
a forgiving waistband.

673
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,214
Hi, Ginny.

674
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:45,849
Elizabeth!

675
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,151
What brings you in?

676
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:49,386
So I was going
through my drawers,

677
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:52,956
and I found
this old recipe of Nonna's,

678
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,091
for Torta alla Monferrina.

679
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,526
Ooh.

680
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:59,229
Apples, pumpkin, figs, brandy...

681
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,597
chocolate.

682
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:03,600
And chocolate is the one thing
I don't have.

683
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,136
Do you happen to know
where I could find some?

684
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,972
I think I have you covered.

685
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:12,309
Look at you...
Baking twice in one week.

686
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,911
When was the last time
you did that?

687
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,546
I can't even remember.

688
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:18,015
It had to be
before Marco and I opened Cibo.

689
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,550
It's good to see you
finally finding the time

690
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:20,951
to do something you love again.

691
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,519
That's just it...
I don't have the time.

692
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:27,057
I just forgot to assign someone
to bring dessert tonight,

693
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:30,060
and I already happened to have
most of the ingredients.

694
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:33,030
Except I was thinking about
adding just a hint of espresso...

695
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:33,932
- Mm!
- Just to give it

696
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:35,232
my own twist.

697
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:36,400
And I'm gonna make sure

698
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,402
that Ben knows
that I used local figs,

699
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:41,371
because I want him to see
how much we value farm-to-table.

700
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:43,407
That's why you suddenly
found the time to bake

701
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:44,942
a special dessert.

702
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,110
You invited Ben tonight!

703
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,179
Yes.

704
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,215
In a professional capacity.

705
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:52,916
You know, no one would judge you

706
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,985
if you started dating again.

707
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:56,855
We all want you to be happy.

708
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,691
I will be happy

709
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,093
once I know that Cibo is okay.

710
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:04,628
That's not what
I'm talking about,

711
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,363
and you know it.

712
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,533
Well, that doesn't mean
that I want to talk about it.

713
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:13,570
Marco's legacy
is all that matters.

714
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:16,073
That's not the only thing
that matters.

715
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:17,641
It's your life, too,

716
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:19,109
and you're allowed to live it.

717
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,578
I am.

718
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,213
No.

719
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,616
You're living Marco's life.

720
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:28,252
Well, it was our life.

721
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,288
But what do you want?

722
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,590
You know what I want?

723
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:34,691
I want to have one day

724
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:37,561
where I am not worried
about the future

725
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,363
or thinking about the past.

726
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,431
That's what I want.

727
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:48,164
Hard to do when you're still
wearing your wedding ring.

728
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:57,181
Can we go back to just
talking about chocolate?

729
00:31:58,283 --> 00:31:59,716
Sure.

730
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,318
Take whatever you need
from the stock in back.

731
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,921
Thanks.

732
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,529
Hi.

733
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,466
Hi. What are you doing here?

734
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:19,436
I was just getting, uh,
some wine.

735
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,637
That's a great choice.

736
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:23,106
We actually have that
on our wine list.

737
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,609
Did you have to beat the owner
at Scrabble to get a case?

738
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,010
I think it was Parcheesi.

739
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,745
Ahh!

740
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:30,314
All right, I better
get back to work.

741
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:31,149
I can't have my client thinking

742
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:34,051
that I'm gallivanting
around town.

743
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:36,620
I feel like you don't do much
gallivanting in general.

744
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,655
Everyone deserves
time for themselves.

745
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,290
Is that what you're doing?

746
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:44,594
Me? No, no. I'm just
picking up supplies for tonight.

747
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:47,464
I don't really make time
for time.

748
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,699
Well, it sounds like
we should both attempt

749
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,534
to go a minute without work.

750
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:50,634
Right now?

751
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,669
Phones away.

752
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,340
Okay. Go.

753
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,313
What do you think about
live music at the restaurant?

754
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,315
See? I knew you couldn't do it.

755
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,617
I know, I've got a problem.
Come on. What do you think?

Yeah, I should do some work

- Bye.

767
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:34,504
Hi.

768
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,707
Wow. Hi.

769
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,276
You found it.

770
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:42,180
Yeah, got rid of the app.

Yeah. Sure.

773
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:52,789
Thank you for this.

774
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,491
It's a potluck,
so everyone brought something.

775
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,393
Oh, good, thanks for telling me.

776
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:56,526
I appreciate that.

777
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:57,828
Ben's here.

778
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,429
- Ciao!
- Hi, Ben.

779
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,665
- Ciao!
- Buona sera, Ben.

780
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,867
Grazie. I appreciate you
guys letting me join you.

781
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,435
It's very kind.

782
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,571
I'm surprised
anybody's happy to see me.

783
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:08,672
That's nice.

784
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:09,940
It's Monday dinner.

785
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,709
We leave the outside world
at the door.

786
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,743
Ah.

787
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:16,480
Sofia?
This is Mr. Elliott.

788
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:17,647
He is a restaurant consultant.

789
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:18,849
Hi.

790
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,717
For Cibo?
Why? What's wrong?

791
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:21,918
Nothing's wrong.

792
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,353
I'm just here
to help out a little bit.

793
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:25,222
It's nice to meet you, Sofia.
What's this?

794
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,524
Oh, I'm just doodling.

795
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:28,692
Doodling?

796
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,460
No, no, no.
This is not a doodle.

797
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,496
This is, uh...
this is beautiful.

798
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,698
Yeah,
she's a really good artist.

799
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,766
Sofia, can I ask you a question?

800
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,301
Would you be comfortable

801
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,437
if your mother used this
in one of her menus?

802
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,606
That's a great idea.

803
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,876
I'm disappointed
I didn't think of it myself.

804
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,612
Antonio!

805
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:50,614
What are you making tonight?

806
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,215
Ravioli al baccalà

807
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:53,650
con crema di bufala,

808
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,886
cipolla rossa
e pomodorino candito.

809
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,622
It's a, uh...

810
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,558
cod ravioli with buffalo cream,

811
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,693
red onion,
and candied cherry tomato.

812
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,930
It's a... piattino.
A small plate.

813
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,832
Here. Try it.

814
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,700
- Oh, you want me to try it?
- Sì.

815
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,903
Cheers.

816
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,404
Mm!

817
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,473
This is stunning.

818
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,675
Why have I never seen this
on a Cibo menu?

819
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,843
Oh, it's not.

820
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,678
It's, uh, just my twist

821
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,346
on a recipe I learned
growing up.

822
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,282
Yeah, this is very good.

823
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:28,251
Uh, my concierge at the hotel
mentioned something

824
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:29,452
about a chef's competition
at the Artisan Festival?

825
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:30,554
What of it?

826
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:31,688
Well, I hope you're entering.

827
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,724
I don't think
that's a good idea.

828
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:37,994
Antonio.

829
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:39,462
We should at least consider

830
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:40,398
adding this
to one of the specials.

831
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:42,365
Refreshing the menu's

832
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,767
one of the most important things
we can do here.

833
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:44,935
Here.

834
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,570
Ben. You stir.

835
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:47,571
- Stir?
- Sì.

836
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:48,873
Sure.

837
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:51,441
Thank you.

838
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:53,009
Tch-tch-tch-tch.

839
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,278
Let me show you something.

840
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:57,414
Okay. Sure.

841
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,316
You should do... like this.

842
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:00,351
Yeah?

843
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:04,722
You want me to lift it up
like that?

844
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,056
Sì.

845
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,325
Okay. I got that.
I can do that. No problem.

846
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:09,859
Just do that.

847
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,562
- Bring it up like this, right?
- Mm.

848
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:17,601
She's messing with me?
Okay. Good.

849
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:18,668
Appreciate that.

850
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:19,736
It's okay.

851
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,671
You want me to stir this or not?

852
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:21,706
- No.
- No?

853
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,510
No, I know what you're doing.

854
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,319
Careful,
those are very long pieces.

855
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,922
Oh... ha, ha.

856
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,323
What am I missing here?

857
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,559
Nothing. Nothing.

858
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,861
Elizabeth here committed
one of the biggest sins

859
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:46,029
in Italian cooking.

860
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,631
Is that right?
What'd you do?

861
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,566
- I did not.
- Did you use sauce from a jar?

862
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:50,967
Worse!

863
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,602
What could be worse than that?
Nonna, come on.

864
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,372
Do we have to talk about this?

865
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:56,840
It was ten years ago.

866
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,542
Oh, I think this is the perfect
time to talk about this.

867
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:00,444
What do you guys think?

868
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,478
- Uh, yes.
- Mm-hmm.

869
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,380
I do!

870
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,415
She's in. Here we go!

871
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,616
Okay. Fine.

872
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:11,488
So... it was Nonna's
first time visiting

873
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,490
and I wanted to impress her...

874
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,392
Oh, you impressed her,
all right.

875
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:18,495
I could help in the kitchen...

876
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,897
So when it came time to put
the spaghetti into the pot,

877
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:22,499
Elizabeth took the pasta...

878
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,833
She held it over the pot...

879
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,735
And before any of us
could stop her...

880
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:29,539
I... broke the spaghetti
in two.

881
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,807
Mom!

882
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,909
Oh, no!

883
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,778
Even Sofia knows
you don't do that.

884
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,613
Sofia's half-Italian.

885
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,648
Oh, the cracking sound...

886
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,650
It was terrible.

887
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,086
I almost fainted.

888
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,655
I'll bet you did.

889
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,758
Well, needless to say,
I learned my lesson.

890
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:49,926
Now...

891
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,163
I cut my spaghetti
with scissors.

892
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:55,333
Okay, okay.

893
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,034
Here. Have a little more

894
00:38:58,035 --> 00:38:59,703
No, no, no.
Grazie, grazie.

895
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:00,704
Yeah, yeah,
you like the potatoes.

896
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:01,805
This is where I draw the line.

897
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:02,606
There's no more room in there.

898
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:04,708
The secret is to say you're full

899
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,076
one helping
before you actually are.

900
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,444
Mm-hmm.

901
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:09,046
I wish I'd known that
an hour ago.

902
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:19,123
I'm... I'm gonna start getting
everything ready for dessert.

903
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:21,926
Okay.

904
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,565
It's okay to start, Ben.

905
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,433
- Mangia.
- N onna.

906
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,569
Finally. All right.

907
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,038
Mm.

908
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,208
- Nonna?
- Mm-hmm?

909
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,478
This might be one of
the best desserts I've had.

910
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:42,846
Now I know
where your son gets it.

911
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:44,647
I did not bake this.

912
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:45,982
You?

913
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:47,017
Mm-mm.

914
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,487
No...

915
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,989
You've been holding out on me.
You bake?

916
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,458
I used to, when I was little.

917
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:57,026
I'll try it.

918
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:59,629
Now it's just sort of a hobby

919
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,731
that I never seem
to find time to do.

920
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,600
Elizabeth! Ooh!

921
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,869
Whose recipe is this?

922
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,104
You know, actually, it's
a twist on your recipe, Nonna.

923
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:09,172
I hope you don't mind,

924
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:11,040
I changed it up
just a little bit.

925
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,876
Of course, I don't mind.

926
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,911
Sometimes...

927
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:18,615
change makes the things better.

928
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:22,152
You made it your own.

929
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:23,586
Ben fatto!

930
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,122
Excuse me?

931
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:29,826
Ben...

932
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,895
"ben fatto,"
it means "well done."

933
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:33,530
Ahh.

934
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:34,664
Well, in that case...

935
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:35,866
Ben is a fatso.
Come here.

936
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,270
No, I can't.
I can't have any more.

937
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,038
You guys are gonna
have to roll me out of here.

938
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,007
However, I am very glad

939
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:46,643
that you made time
to bake this today.

940
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:48,077
We all are.

941
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:49,746
Yeah.

942
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,848
Not a bad way to spend
a Monday night.

943
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,584
No, it's not.

944
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,425
I can't remember the last time
I felt this way.

945
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:59,923
About a meal, I meant.
I can't even describe it.

946
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:01,057
We call it,

947
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:06,296
La gioia della tavola.

948
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,065
"The joys of the table."

949
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:10,834
That's lovely.
That's lovely.

950
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,068
You guys have
a wonderful family.

951
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,236
I hope you know that.

952
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:15,972
I didn't have a big family
growing up.

953
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,907
Did not realize
what I was missing

954
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:19,143
until I came here.

955
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:29,487
That means so much.
Thank you.

956
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,923
Well...

957
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:35,625
that was, without a doubt,

958
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:37,260
the best business dinner
I've ever had.

959
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,796
I almost forgot
that's what it was.

960
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,131
Yeah.

961
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:49,507
Thank you.

962
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,011
Thank you for tonight.

963
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,882
- Uh, goodnight.
- See you tomorrow.

964
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,017
Okay.

965
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,265
Oh, Richard. Hi.

966
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:16,866
I'm so sorry.

967
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,134
I thought our status meeting
was this afternoon.

968
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:19,215
I needed to see you sooner.

969
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,971
Things have changed.

970
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,973
Well, they're about to...

971
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:25,875
Isn't that the whole point
of all this?

972
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,977
Actually...

973
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:29,178
the other restaurant group

974
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:31,214
moved up the deadline
on their offer.

975
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,216
They need an answer
in three weeks.

976
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,018
Three weeks?

977
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,687
That's not enough time
to turn Cibo around.

978
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:40,690
Even if we followed
all of Ben's suggestions,

979
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:41,824
that's not enough time.

980
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,159
I know.

981
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,928
Which is why
I'm going to take their offer

982
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,764
while it's still on the table.

983
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:50,733
I have no choice.

984
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,570
I'm sorry.

985
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,943
You can't do this to us.

986
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:02,947
After everything
we've been through?

987
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,349
I mean, what am I...
What am I gonna tell everyone?

988
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,751
What am I gonna I tell Sofia?

989
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,386
You're taking away

990
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:12,322
the only thing
we have left of Marco.

991
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,223
Believe me...

992
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,659
I have no choice here.

993
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,696
Times are tough for everyone.

994
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,665
How much are they offering?

995
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:24,934
250,000.

996
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,170
Well, I don't want to sell.

997
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:30,239
I will take out a loan
and buy out your share.

998
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,808
If you could do that,

999
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,310
nothing would make me happier.

1000
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:36,813
But...

1001
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:38,282
it's not realistic.

1002
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:40,850
Why not?

1003
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,385
I've been in business
a long time

1004
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,220
and no bank
is going to lend money

1005
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:45,956
to a business
that's already on the brink.

1006
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:49,959
I truly wish
things were different.

1007
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,729
It has been a tough year...

1008
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,399
and I really have no choice,
Elizabeth.

1009
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:59,002
I understand.

1010
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:00,937
I'm so sorry.

1011
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:02,239
Thank you.

1012
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,353
So make sure you get room 206
room service...

1013
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:18,354
Continental breakfast.

1014
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:20,290
Thank you.

1015
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,395
Good morning, Mr. Elliott.

1016
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:26,829
Good morning, Charlotte.

1017
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,331
Early start today?

1018
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,732
Yeah, I thought
I'd walk around town

1019
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:31,000
before I head into Cibo.

1020
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,002
Huh. The island's really
growing on you, eh?

1021
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,104
Yeah, I suppose it is.

1022
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:36,206
Have a good day, okay?

1023
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:38,508
Don't work too hard!

1024
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,977
Thank you.

1025
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,887
Hey, Jared. What's up?

1026
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:18,916
Elizabeth?

1027
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,719
Oh.

1028
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:24,922
Hi.

1029
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,124
I heard about the offer
getting moved up,

1030
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:29,158
that Richard's taking it.

1031
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,460
Yeah.

1032
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:33,096
So I guess that means
you're out of a job.

1033
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:36,200
I'm not worried about that.
I'm worried about you.

1034
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:38,835
I'll be fine.

1035
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:42,371
I just need $125,000
in the next three weeks.

1036
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:44,574
You speak to the bank?

1037
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,876
Apparently, it will take
some kind of miracle

1038
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:49,011
for them to loan me
that type of money.

1039
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:50,113
No, no, no.

1040
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:52,081
They just need
a compelling reason.

1041
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,449
We can still give them that.

1042
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,051
"We"?

1043
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:58,087
Aren't you moving on?

1044
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,490
Never left a job
until it was done.

1045
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:02,226
We're not done yet.

1046
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:05,928
I can't pay you the type
of money that Richard did.

1047
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:09,265
It's on the house.

1048
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,100
Do you do this
for all your clients?

1049
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,036
Uh...

1050
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,140
.,..you're the first.

1051
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:25,581
Good morning.

1052
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:26,883
Oh!

1053
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:27,950
You're here early.

1054
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,552
I, uh, picked up
some fresh salmon

1055
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:31,220
from a friend of mine
this morning

1056
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:33,289
and thought I'd play around
with some recipes.

1057
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,525
Well, if it's anything
like you made the other night,

1058
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:37,426
I would be honored
to be your test subject.

1059
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:39,896
What do we got?

1060
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:42,299
We have, uh, pan-roasted
salmon puttanesca...

1061
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:45,501
Hmm.

1062
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:47,970
Pan-roasted salmon
with herb gnocchetti

1063
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,238
in an olive vinaigrette...

1064
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,406
Okay.

1065
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:52,910
And salmon alla stimpirata.

1066
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:55,244
Hmm.

1067
00:46:57,514 --> 00:47:01,150
Antonio, I've had some of
the finest cuisine in the world.

1068
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,252
These three rank right up there.

1069
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:04,921
Thank you.

1070
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,122
So we'll put them on the menu.

1071
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:07,157
No.

1072
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:11,160
Antonio, you're killing me here.

1073
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:14,230
Look, I understand
why Elizabeth is reluctant

1074
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:15,998
to make changes
to what Cibo did in the past,

1075
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,433
but you seem just as reluctant,
my friend.

1076
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:19,035
Why is that?

1077
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,404
Don't you want to make
a name for yourself?

1078
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:22,438
Don't you want more?

1079
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,941
What I have here

1080
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:27,176
is already more than
I could have ever dreamed of.

1081
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,912
Okay.

1082
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,581
Back in Italy,

1083
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:34,217
I was always getting myself
into trouble.

1084
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:36,586
I knew cooking was my way out,
but...

1085
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:39,255
I made some mistakes.

1086
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:43,259
I lost the money for tuition
at culinary school.

1087
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,994
When Marco found this out,

1088
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:47,064
he paid my way.

1089
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,532
When he asked me

1090
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,001
if I'd come to the U.S.
to open Cibo,

1091
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:54,971
it was the easiest decision
I ever made.

1092
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:57,340
Everything I have

1093
00:47:57,341 --> 00:48:00,943
is all because Marco Campisi
believed in me.

1094
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:05,514
My way of thanking him
is to keep his legacy alive.

1095
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:08,085
I understand.

1096
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:13,155
But isn't your talent...

1097
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:14,557
part of that legacy, too?

1098
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,692
This is my decision, Ben.

1099
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:19,429
This is how
I've chosen to honor him.

1100
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:24,100
You can't honor him
from a closed kitchen, Antonio.

1101
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,269
Listen to me.

1102
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:29,305
You are the key
to everything here.

1103
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:31,707
Your food

1104
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,543
is how we bring Cibo back.

1105
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:37,546
Thank you for saying that, Ben,

1106
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,548
but I don't think Mrs. Campisi

1107
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:41,584
would ever be okay
with changing the menu.

1108
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,386
I would never ask her to.

1109
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:46,255
It's her link to Marco,
just like it is for me.

1110
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,990
Okay. Well, let me talk to her.

1111
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:49,325
What if she says no?

1112
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:50,227
Don't worry about that.

1113
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:51,260
You...

1114
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,397
just be ready.

1115
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:55,998
Okay.

1116
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:57,233
Okay.

1117
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:58,768
Okay!

1118
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,269
Okay, pal.

1119
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,706
All right. Progress!

1120
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:10,681
You couldn't have
just said, "Ben?"

1121
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:14,183
Guy asked for a name
for the cup.

1122
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:15,686
"Cuppy."

1123
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:18,554
I think I would've gone
with "Steve".

1124
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:19,957
Nah. Cuppy's cuter.

1125
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:26,762
So, I'm guessing
you didn't want to meet today

1126
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:29,498
just to talk about
paper products, did you?

1127
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:31,300
No. There's something else.

1128
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,469
Of course, there is.

1129
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,671
What is that? What's wrong?
Did something happen?

1130
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:37,707
It's just, no, I'm...

1131
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:40,576
I'm just starting to see
the writing on the wall,

1132
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:43,512
and it's a sign,

1133
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:45,481
and it says, "for lease".

1134
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,583
Not if I can help it.

1135
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:50,086
I talked to my friend, Gail.

1136
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:51,587
She's the loan officer
at the bank,

1137
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:53,122
and Richard was right.

1138
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:55,358
They are not
going to lend us a dime

1139
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,526
unless we have the same type
of buzz we did before.

1140
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:58,627
Ah.

1141
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,262
Let's be honest, Ben.

1142
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:02,631
It's impossible to get that kind
of buzz in three months,

1143
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:04,767
let alone three weeks.

1144
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:06,268
Not impossible.

1145
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:08,472
Hard, but not impossible.

1146
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:13,776
Look, Elizabeth, you have
everything that you need

1147
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:15,544
to get back on top,
right in front of you.

1148
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:17,413
You got the best chef
on the island,

1149
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:20,316
maybe even the entire region,
in your kitchen,

1150
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:23,219
and all you have to do
is give him the freedom

1151
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,454
to show everybody else
what we already know.

1152
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:28,657
And what we know
is that he's a culinary genius.

1153
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:31,794
Mm-hmm, well,
he learned from the best...

1154
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:34,797
and, honestly?

1155
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:37,166
He might be even better.

1156
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:39,735
But I asked him, two years ago,

1157
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:42,171
if he wanted to put his dishes
on the menu,

1158
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:45,408
he said no...
He wouldn't even discuss it.

1159
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,143
I think, if you asked him again,

1160
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:48,424
you might get
a different answer.

1161
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,750
But first, you need to give him
your blessing.

1162
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:56,786
He needs to know
that you are okay

1163
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,455
making this change.

1164
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:05,661
Everyone keeps telling me
to move on, let go, change.

1165
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:07,630
It's not that easy.

1166
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:12,069
It's not like
I can just flip a switch.

1167
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:18,407
I know.

1168
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,343
Believe me, I know.

1169
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:33,282
Buon pomeriggio, Nonna.

1170
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:34,918
Mm. Mwah.

1171
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:38,522
Tch. Eh?

1172
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,524
I thought
the double-cheek-kiss thing

1173
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:43,392
was reserved just for family.

1174
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:44,627
Campisi rule...

1175
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:46,862
You have
a family dinner with us,

1176
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:49,366
you are family, so.

1177
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:54,870
Ah, ecco. It's done.

1178
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:56,472
- Grazie, Nonna.
- We'd love to join you.

1179
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:58,593
We have to talk to Antonio,
so we'll see you in a bit.

1180
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:03,679
She doesn't know what's
going on with the business,

1181
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,481
- does she?
- I'll have to tell her soon.

1182
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:06,849
She's not gonna like it
when she finds out

1183
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,285
Antonio's making
his own recipes, though.

1184
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:13,923
Antonio is going
to be making his own recipes?

1185
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:15,925
Nonna...

1186
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:17,927
let me explain.

1187
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:20,329
No need to explain.

1188
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:23,600
I always hoped you would
give Antonio a chance.

1189
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:29,004
I thought you would be upset.

1190
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:32,608
I'm just surprised
it took that long.

1191
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:37,680
Marco never would have wanted
his protege, his protetto,

1192
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:41,951
to be making the same recipes
for his whole career.

1193
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:46,021
He would've wanted him
to leave the nest and fly.

1194
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:48,490
Why didn't you
say something sooner?

1195
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:50,460
I mind my own business.

1196
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:54,396
Pretty good
for a mother-in-law, no?

1197
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,632
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

1198
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:58,400
Mm!

1199
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:01,704
Okay. Let's go
tell Antonio it's a "yes,"

1200
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:02,771
shall we?

1201
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:03,773
Yes!

1202
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:06,910
Thank you, Nonna.

1203
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:11,513
No.

1204
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:14,817
I made a promise to Marco
to keep things as they were.

1205
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:16,552
So did I, Antonio,

1206
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:17,987
but I think we were wrong.

1207
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:19,722
I don't think this is
what Marco would have wanted

1208
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:20,990
in the long run.

1209
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:23,025
I can't just forget
about him, Elizabeth.

1210
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:25,861
I create a new menu,
there's nothing left.

1211
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:28,831
The menu's gonna have
a "Campisi Classic" section...

1212
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:31,767
All of Marco's best dishes,
just as they were.

1213
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:32,901
The rest is up to you.

1214
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:35,337
This is how we honor the past

1215
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:36,406
and embrace the future.

1216
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,585
Mrs. Campisi...

1217
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:51,387
if you and Nonna
don't want me to do this,

1218
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:52,755
I won't.

1219
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:55,557
Nonna and I both think

1220
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:58,295
that you deserve the chance
to shine.

1221
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:02,598
I know that's what
Marco would've wanted

1222
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:04,099
and I'm just sorry

1223
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,580
that it took me
so long to realize it.

1224
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:09,605
I've got this guy
to thank for that.

1225
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:11,106
Just doing my job.

1226
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:12,107
Thank you.

1227
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:16,845
Both of you.

1228
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:18,080
Of course.

1229
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:20,916
The only trouble
is we have just three weeks

1230
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,384
to get the word out,

1231
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:24,453
and it would usually take months
to generate

1232
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:26,622
the type of buzz that we need.

1233
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:28,624
Not if this man enters
the Battle of Bainbridge.

1234
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,526
The team from Coastside
in San Francisco,

1235
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:33,028
they've won seven years
in a row,

1236
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:35,431
and they just received
their third Michelin star!

1237
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:37,066
I don't think I'm ready.

1238
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:39,436
I know you're ready.

1239
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:43,405
And so am I.

1240
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:45,174
It's time we turned the corner.

1241
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,876
Okay.

1242
00:55:58,054 --> 00:55:59,421
Thank you.

1243
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:00,689
I just heard about the festival!

1244
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,890
Congratulations, Antonio.

1245
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:03,792
- Grazie.
- I'm so happy for you.

1246
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:04,894
Thank you.

1247
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:08,697
This smells amazing.
What is it?

1248
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:11,834
And can I have it all
and not share it with anyone?

1249
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:13,602
It's a seared scallops

1250
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:15,437
with corn pudding
and wild truffles,

1251
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:17,139
over a roasted chicken broth.

1252
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,775
Please, enjoy.

1253
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:24,446
Mm.

1254
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:27,683
Antonio, this is incredible.

1255
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:30,085
I've never tasted
scallops like this before.

1256
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:31,553
This is definitely
the recipe you should use

1257
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:32,821
in the competition.

1258
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:35,224
Oh, I can't make this
for the competition.

1259
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,492
Why not?

1260
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:38,660
I'm out of the truffles.

1261
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:39,695
Let's go buy some more.

1262
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:40,696
On me.

1263
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:42,598
I appreciate that,

1264
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:44,600
but there is nowhere
to buy them.

1265
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:46,535
These truffles are
only harvested on this island,

1266
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:49,705
and once they're gone,
they're gone.

1267
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:51,774
Unless we want to go hunt
for any stragglers ourselves.

1268
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:53,242
Talking about a truffle hunt?

1269
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,110
I thought this only
happened in Italy.

1270
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:57,713
Uh, actually, the latitude
of Washington State

1271
00:56:57,714 --> 00:56:59,014
is the same

1272
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:00,916
as the best truffle-growing
regions in Italy.

1273
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,419
And probably
a tenth of the price.

1274
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:06,655
What? It's a win-win.

1275
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:07,923
- You're hopeless.
- I know. What do you want?

1276
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,024
So...

1277
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:10,492
let's go find some.

1278
00:57:10,493 --> 00:57:11,727
Ben, why don't you join me?

1279
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:13,629
Absolutely.
Elizabeth?

1280
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,498
Oh. Uh...

1281
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,767
Ginny, do you want to join us?

1282
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,636
I have to get back to the store.

1283
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:23,440
Okay. Then it's just us three.

1284
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:26,576
Great.

1285
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:34,683
So, now you know
what to look for,

1286
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:37,853
let's hope
we have some luck, huh?

1287
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:39,154
Okay, you two try
this section over there...

1288
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:40,222
Okay.

1289
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:42,591
And I'll look up here.

1290
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:43,659
Andiamo.

1291
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,527
- Good luck.
- You too.

1292
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:47,128
All right, let's see
what we can do here.

1293
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:51,567
Hey, look,
I want to say thank you.

1294
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:53,702
Why? For what?

1295
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:55,304
For being so open
to all these changes.

1296
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,573
The hardest part of my job

1297
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:58,841
is getting someone
to be open to change

1298
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:00,709
so that they can
help themselves,

1299
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:02,711
that and knowing when to push,

1300
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,546
and not to push too far.

1301
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:05,814
You've been really courageous

1302
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,916
and I want
to thank you for that.

1303
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:09,117
Well, I don't know.

1304
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:12,020
I wasn't really open
to any changes at first.

1305
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:14,656
Yeah, you were guarded.

1306
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,760
Understandable, given everything
that you've been through.

1307
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:21,898
Not everybody's
as strong as you are.

1308
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:25,100
I didn't really have a choice.

1309
00:58:25,101 --> 00:58:26,821
I had a lot of people
counting on me, and...

1310
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:31,007
then I realized
I could count on you.

1311
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:34,911
Yeah. Absolutely.

1312
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:42,150
Whoo-hoo!

1313
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:44,353
Ben! Elizabeth!

1314
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,189
Come. I found them.

1315
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:50,759
Should we go?

1316
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,595
Sure.

1317
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:55,364
We're coming!

1318
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,707
Sofia!

1319
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,743
This is beautiful.

1320
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:10,078
Wow!

1321
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,519
I wonder if my dad
would've liked it.

1322
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:15,117
I'm sure
your dad would've loved it.

1323
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:17,152
From what I'm told,
your dad was a true artist,

1324
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:18,921
and so are you.

1325
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:22,024
You're keeping his legacy alive.
You should be very proud.

1326
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:23,392
There's one more box
in the back.

1327
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,626
Yeah, okay.

1328
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:26,229
Keep going.

1329
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:28,964
Antonio!

1330
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:31,199
Hey.

1331
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,335
I am so glad you're finally
entering the competition.

1332
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:34,870
What took you so long?

1333
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:37,706
Uh, I just wanted to make sure
that I was ready.

1334
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:38,874
That we all were.

1335
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,909
Mm! Well, I'm sure

1336
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:43,178
people will be very excited
to see what you can do.

1337
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:44,746
I know Cibo needs a comeback.

1338
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:47,049
I truly hope this is the start
of something big.

1339
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,750
Thank you. So do we.

1340
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,252
Oh,

1341
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:51,853
and what will you be offering
for the dessert portion?

1342
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:54,222
We haven't decided yet.

1343
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:57,326
Okay, yeah, well, let us know
as soon as you can.

1344
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:59,128
Absolutely. Yeah. Thank you.

1345
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:03,398
Is Christina gonna make
her zuccotto cake?

1346
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:04,933
No, she just texted me.

1347
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,969
She's already baking something
for Joli Plat.

1348
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:08,170
Can she do that?

1349
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:10,672
Yes, we're not her only clients.

1350
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:13,041
I am surprised you guys never
had an in-house pastry chef.

1351
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:14,810
Well, we talked about
bringing someone in,

1352
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:16,044
but then Marco passed,

1353
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:18,013
and we were just trying
to stay afloat.

1354
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:19,815
Can you think
of anyone else in Seattle

1355
01:00:19,816 --> 01:00:21,284
who might be able to do it?

1356
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:28,023
Why are the two of you
looking at me like that?

1357
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:29,691
Because you should be
the person to make this dessert.

1358
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:30,892
Me?

1359
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:32,294
- Yeah.
- Those two cakes you made

1360
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:35,063
were better than anything
Christina ever did.

1361
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:37,165
They're so good, Mom!

1362
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:39,034
And professional quality.

1363
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:40,936
No. I'm not
a professional pastry chef.

1364
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:41,937
That's okay.

1365
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:44,339
No, the future of our restaurant

1366
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:47,209
cannot hinge on something
I do as a hobby!

1367
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:49,811
Isn't that how Marco
got started cooking?

1368
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,280
For his friends,
in his free time, just for fun?

1369
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:54,383
You can do that, too.

1370
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:56,051
No.

1371
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:57,120
Elizabeth...

1372
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:00,422
can I talk to you for a sec?

1373
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:02,659
- Sure. Yeah.
- Okay. Come on.

1374
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:08,463
What if...

1375
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:10,064
this is actually
what you're meant to do?

1376
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:14,236
It's so clear to me

1377
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,406
that everything's
been leading to this.

1378
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:19,408
You can do this.

1379
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:20,743
Come on.

1380
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:25,081
It's gonna be fine.

1381
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,921
Sofia, what are you
still doing up?

1382
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:34,256
It's so late.

1383
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:35,991
I was working on the menu board
for tomorrow.

1384
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:37,793
Aw.

1385
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:39,961
That is beautiful.

1386
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:42,330
He's changing a lot at Cibo,
isn't he?

1387
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:47,302
Well, I think in a good way,
but yes.

1388
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:48,804
Does that make you upset?

1389
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:50,906
Because you know
that none of this means

1390
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:52,774
that we're forgetting
about your dad, right?

1391
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:54,409
I'm not upset, Mom.

1392
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:56,411
I'm happy.

1393
01:01:56,412 --> 01:01:58,481
And Dad would've loved
how happy this makes you.

1394
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:04,186
Well, you know what
really makes me happy

1395
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:09,124
is seeing what an amazing person
you are turning out to be.

1396
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:14,397
And your dad
would be so proud of you.

1397
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,740
Now go to bed!

1398
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:39,087
Glad to see you
coming into your own, Tony.

1399
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:41,857
Well, someone has to beat you
one of these days.

1400
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:43,291
So, what are you making?

1401
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:45,093
Grilled Bay Shrimp
with some Cajun-glazed jam...

1402
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,495
Are you sure about this?

1403
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:48,497
Positive.

1404
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:49,831
Hey.

1405
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:52,100
Deep breath.

1406
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,436
You got everything you need.

1407
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:57,006
Okay?

1408
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:02,043
Well, folks,
it is going to be hard

1409
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:04,479
to top yesterday's
four entries, but...

1410
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,349
these four teams
are going to try!

1411
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,317
You have two hours

1412
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:11,553
to complete your entrees
and desserts,

1413
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:13,221
and present it to our judges.

1414
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:15,090
And please join me

1415
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:17,993
in welcoming this year's
very special guest judge,

1416
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:20,229
Carmen Costa!

1417
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:25,500
Thank you!

1418
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:26,902
Thank you!

1419
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:28,503
Okay, I'm way more nervous now.

1420
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:31,173
I'm not.

1421
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:33,075
Okay, maybe a little.

1422
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,144
Thank you for
making the dessert, Elizabeth.

1423
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,879
It really means a lot to me.

1424
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,648
I'm honored.

1425
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,483
Let's go win this thing.

1426
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,552
For Marco.

1427
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,488
And for ourselves.

1428
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:49,024
All right, it's time!

1429
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:50,259
Let's begin!

1430
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,054
Uh, problem!

1431
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:20,322
What's wrong?

1432
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:21,190
The burner's not working.

1433
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:22,191
What?

1434
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:23,625
What's going on?

1435
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:24,960
- The burner's not working!
- Okay, okay. All right.

1436
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:26,461
Well, can we... can we fix it?

1437
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:28,163
These things
are kind of finicky.

1438
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:30,198
- You gotta take 'em all apart.
- Well, we don't have time!

1439
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,333
I still need
to finish the sauce.

1440
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:33,435
Yeah, I know.

1441
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:35,937
Hang tight. Stay here.

1442
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:37,339
Here, let me look at it.

1443
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:40,141
Hi, Chef.
My name is Ben.

1444
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:43,044
Okay! Grab the sauce.
Let's go over.

1445
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,946
- Switch places?
- Yeah. Go ahead.

1446
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:46,147
It's all yours.

1447
01:04:46,148 --> 01:04:47,249
I can't thank you enough.

1448
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,984
- Yeah.
- Thank you so much.

1449
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:50,151
We're already done
and your friend explained

1450
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:51,386
what's at stake...
We're happy to help.

1451
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,288
Thank you. Thank you.

1452
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:54,624
Okay...

1453
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:57,392
Okay. Almost there.
Good luck.

1454
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,161
- Okay, I'm gonna go finish.
- Sure.

1455
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:05,634
Ready?

1456
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:07,536
Andiamo.

1457
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,577
This looks wonderful.

1458
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,280
- Grazie.
- Thank you.

1459
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:23,652
This looks amazing.

1460
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:24,687
Did you try...

1461
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:28,990
Would you like to try

1462
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:29,759
Chef Antonio's
Seared Scallops...

1463
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,192
Here you are, sir.

1464
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:33,162
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

1465
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:40,168
Who's that?

1466
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:41,736
My friend from school.

1467
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:44,005
We've been working on
a graphic novel during lunch.

1468
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:46,241
I'm gonna bring her a piece
of your torta. Be right back.

1469
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:47,275
Sure!

1470
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:49,144
Oh...

1471
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:51,446
all this time, I thought she was
just hiding from her problems

1472
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,114
in the art room.

1473
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:55,584
Turns out she was just finding
where she really belongs.

1474
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:59,221
Yeah, I think
that's going around.

1475
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:03,592
Cheers. Enjoy, my friend.

1476
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:08,363
This has been
the most competitive year

1477
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:10,332
we have seen in a long time,

1478
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:11,766
but we can only crown

1479
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:13,469
one winning restaurant's
culinary team.

1480
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:17,439
For the eighth year in a row,

1481
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,673
the grand prize

1482
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:21,042
goes to Chef Hill
and Pastry Chef Levitz,

1483
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:22,678
from Coastside San Francisco.

1484
01:06:33,522 --> 01:06:35,790
It's my fault.
I'm so sorry.

1485
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,692
- It wasn't good enough.
- No. No.

1486
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:41,229
Antonio,
your dish was perfection.

1487
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:44,332
It's just my dessert,
it wasn't up to par.

1488
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,401
Oh, yours was great.

1489
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:48,303
We did the best we could.

1490
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:51,072
Your dish
was extraordinary, Chef.

1491
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:53,274
Grazie. Coming from you,
that's a huge compliment.

1492
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:54,709
And I loved your dessert.

1493
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,444
Thank you.

1494
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:58,780
Personally,
I thought you should've won.

1495
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:00,448
You had my vote.

1496
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:02,784
I can't wait to try
the rest of your menu.

1497
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:04,185
I'll be sure to come in soon.

1498
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:06,489
Thank you.

1499
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:14,129
Well, the only problem is,

1500
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:17,098
there probably won't be
a restaurant for her to come to.

1501
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:19,267
Oh...

1502
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:20,802
We didn't win.

1503
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:23,105
The bank has nothing to go on.

1504
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:27,342
I'm sorry.

1505
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:28,577
It's over.

1506
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:49,264
I'm so sorry, guys.

1507
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:50,598
I... I can't even believe it.

1508
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:51,734
I was sure you would win.

1509
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:55,137
We were really hoping
that we would.

1510
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:00,175
Are you seeing this?

1511
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:01,609
Look at this!

1512
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:03,545
Oh. "Il Cibo..."

1513
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:05,747
best food in Washington."

1514
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,248
Hmm!

1515
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:09,250
It gets better.
Look at the hashtags.

1516
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:11,653
"Il Cibo è Vita is back!"

1517
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:13,488
I don't understand

1518
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:15,457
How is this possible?
We lost.

1519
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:17,525
Maybe Carmen posted something?

1520
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:19,327
I don't know, if she did,
I can't find it.

1521
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:20,628
There's too much
going on here. Look.

1522
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:23,231
This is all from regular people
trying your food.

1523
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:24,833
Mamma mia!

1524
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:26,468
It's better than winning.

1525
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:28,570
This is exactly what we needed.

1526
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:30,205
This is, uh, word of mouth.

1527
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:31,339
At the speed of light!

1528
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:32,707
- That's right.
- Guys, we're almost full

1529
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:33,842
for tomorrow night!

1530
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:34,843
Brava!

1531
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:36,311
How is that possible?

1532
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:37,679
Okay, look,

1533
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,314
we need to squeeze in
as many people as we can.

1534
01:08:39,315 --> 01:08:40,882
Also, let's get
a multi-course tasting menu

1535
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:42,250
for the whole weekend.

1536
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:43,852
- Okay. Let's get started.
- Let's do it.

1537
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:45,253
Good!

1538
01:08:45,254 --> 01:08:48,723
And you...
will be making the desserts.

1539
01:08:48,724 --> 01:08:50,592
Desserts. Plural?

1540
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:51,926
Mm-hmm.

1541
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:53,687
You have so many recipes, Mom!
You can do it!

1542
01:08:54,897 --> 01:08:56,865
- I can...
- Yes.

1543
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:59,334
But I think I'm gonna
need a little help.

1544
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:00,735
I don't know.

1545
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:03,371
This might do it.

1546
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:04,907
I don't think
you need me anymore.

1547
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:08,978
But that doesn't mean
I don't still want you there.

1548
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:15,583
These are little...

1549
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:17,686
I was going to say
I'm down to do strawberries.

1550
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:27,163
High five.

1551
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:29,797
Do this one
with the powdered sugar.

1552
01:09:58,294 --> 01:09:59,294
How are things?

1553
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:00,528
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1554
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:01,829
Those look great.

1555
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:02,997
Beautiful, Nonna.

1556
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:05,034
My goodness, my goodness.

1557
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:12,860
- Very complementary.
- Thank you.

1558
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:15,945
That's a pasta plate.

1559
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:24,385
Are you enjoying
the food, everyone?

1560
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:25,954
Great.

1561
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:28,890
Eh, look who it is!

1562
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:31,593
The food is good?

1563
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:33,528
That's great.
So happy to hear it.

1564
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:35,730
Enjoy.

1565
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:38,566
Antonio,
everyone loves your food.

1566
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:40,468
I'm so happy for you.

1567
01:10:40,469 --> 01:10:41,736
When the dessert course
is served,

1568
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:43,071
they'll go crazy for that, too.

1569
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:45,241
Thank you.

1570
01:10:55,784 --> 01:10:58,620
I think Marco would have loved
the new layout.

1571
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:00,855
- You think?
- Mm-hmm.

1572
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:03,725
I just feel like
they're part of a big family.

1573
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:05,460
I just want everybody
to feel what I did

1574
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:06,462
at Monday Dinner.

1575
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:11,032
And what did you feel?

1576
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:12,768
Like I was home.

1577
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:18,940
Who's that?

1578
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,608
That's Gail, from the bank.

1579
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:22,010
Really?

1580
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:23,845
I didn't know that
she was gonna be here tonight.

1581
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:25,713
This is a very good thing.

1582
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:28,583
This is exactly
what she needs to see.

1583
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:30,885
Here, look, why don't you
go talk to Gail?

1584
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:31,787
I'm gonna get some more wine.

1585
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:32,920
- Okay.
- Okay.

1586
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:34,889
And I called and called
and called

1587
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:37,892
until I finally got through
to make a reservation.

1588
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:39,761
I'm so glad you did!

1589
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:42,597
Everything so far is amazing.

1590
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:44,832
And I love that there's still
a spot on the menu

1591
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:47,402
for Marco's classics...
It's just perfect.

1592
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:48,803
Congratulations.

1593
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:50,071
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1594
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:52,740
So...

1595
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:55,109
what do you think?

1596
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:57,712
Do you think we have a chance
at getting that loan?

1597
01:11:57,713 --> 01:12:00,783
I think you can be
cautiously optimistic.

1598
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:05,820
Whoa. You have no idea
how happy that makes me.

1599
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:07,088
Cautiously! Cautiously happy.

1600
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:08,723
Good.

1601
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:10,825
There is one possible bump
the bank might have.

1602
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:12,860
Sure, yeah. What's that?

1603
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:15,063
We understand you used
a professional consultant

1604
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:16,097
to spearhead this turnaround.

1605
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:18,099
Ben Elliott. Yes.

1606
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:21,102
Since Richard is also
not in the picture,

1607
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:23,404
you'll need to reassure
the bank that, going forward,

1608
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:26,074
you'll be able to maintain
all this on your own.

1609
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:29,844
Ben inspired so many
wonderful changes around here,

1610
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:32,413
and I will be forever grateful
for that.

1611
01:12:32,414 --> 01:12:36,617
He pushed me to my limit,
in the best way possible,

1612
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:39,821
but... his job is done.

1613
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:42,757
I have it from here.

1614
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:44,992
We've just been through so much
upheaval in the last few years,

1615
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:46,861
and it's time
for some stability,

1616
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:48,763
and I'm ready.

1617
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:52,033
Music to a banker's ears.

1618
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,901
Give me a call on Monday.

1619
01:12:53,902 --> 01:12:55,603
I'm sure we can
work something out.

1620
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:57,472
That sounds wonderful.

1621
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:59,006
Can I get you more wine?

1622
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:00,776
- Yes.
- Okay. Be right back.

1623
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:10,452
Oh.

1624
01:13:10,453 --> 01:13:12,453
Where are you going?

1625
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:14,489
Greece, actually.

1626
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:16,524
I'm on the red-eye
out of Seattle.

1627
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:19,494
Oh. You have to go tonight?

1628
01:13:19,495 --> 01:13:22,597
I do, Signora.

1629
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:24,832
I've done everything I can here.

1630
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:27,034
The restaurant's in great hands.

1631
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:29,003
You guys have a lot
to celebrate.

1632
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:33,075
And we want you to stay
and celebrate, too.

1633
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:39,914
Don't you and Elizabeth
have more to talk about?

1634
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:42,017
I think it's time for me to go.

1635
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:49,791
Hey...

1636
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:52,994
we are family, remember?

1637
01:13:52,995 --> 01:13:54,863
Of course.

1638
01:13:57,666 --> 01:13:59,600
It's truly been
my honor, Signora.

1639
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:01,703
Ciao.

1640
01:14:24,259 --> 01:14:27,228
Nonna. Have you seen Ben?

1641
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:28,863
He had to go.

1642
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:31,065
Go where?
To run an errand?

1643
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:33,034
Catch a plane.

1644
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:34,470
He left?

1645
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:38,474
Without saying goodbye?

1646
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:47,882
I just don't understand this.

1647
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:49,050
I thought you and Ben...

1648
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:50,585
I thought so, too,

1649
01:14:50,586 --> 01:14:53,120
but we never really
talked about it.

1650
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:55,323
Guess he didn't feel
the same way.

1651
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,191
Of course, he did!

1652
01:14:57,192 --> 01:14:59,560
There was something special
happening between you two.

1653
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:01,229
We all saw it.

1654
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:02,597
Well, he left, Ginny.

1655
01:15:02,598 --> 01:15:04,198
That tells me everything
I need to know.

1656
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:07,001
The desserts look
beautiful, Elizabeth.

1657
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:09,838
- Thank you.
- I am so proud of you.

1658
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:13,608
Oh, mia cara.

1659
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:17,045
I don't think Ben wanted to go.

1660
01:15:18,313 --> 01:15:21,582
Well...

1661
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:23,217
Wait. When we... When we were
looking for truffles,

1662
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:24,852
he told me

1663
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:27,221
that he always does

1664
01:15:27,222 --> 01:15:28,990
what he thinks
is the right thing for someone,

1665
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:31,893
even if they don't understand it
at the time.

1666
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:34,996
Do you think
that could that be it?

1667
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:37,765
There's only one way
to find out.

1668
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:38,833
I have to go find him.

1669
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:40,035
Sì.

1670
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:44,038
Go. We got this.

1671
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,774
Thank you. Thank you.

1672
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:58,019
Mrs. Campisi.

1673
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,253
Congrats on the battle.

1674
01:15:59,254 --> 01:16:01,822
Everyone on social's
still talking about you.

1675
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:03,057
You know, I can't even
get a reservation.

1676
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:05,026
Thank you. Yeah.
We're still catching up.

1677
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:06,827
Um...

1678
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:08,763
just out of curiosity...

1679
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:12,400
Would you have any idea if
Ben Elliott has checked out yet?

1680
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:14,135
You know I can't share
that kind of information.

1681
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:15,169
It's a privacy thing.

1682
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:17,706
Right. No.
Of course not.

1683
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:21,008
Uh...

1684
01:16:21,009 --> 01:16:22,009
oh, wow.

1685
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:24,679
Look at that.

1686
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,600
There was just a cancellation
for tomorrow night.

1687
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:31,385
Of course, if a guest were
to check out this late,

1688
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:33,054
they'd probably already be on
the ferry back to the Mainland.

1689
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:35,022
Okay. Thank you, Charlotte.

1690
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:36,257
Thank you.

1691
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:37,498
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

1692
01:17:21,103 --> 01:17:22,170
Any requests?

1693
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:27,776

01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:01,175
Couldn't do it this time.

1708
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:03,477

I, uh...

1714
01:18:16,925 --> 01:18:19,527
I heard what you said to Gail,

1715
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:21,062
about everything
that you've been through,

1716
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:23,497
about not needing me anymore,

1717
01:18:23,498 --> 01:18:24,899
you all needing stability...

1718
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:26,100
You're right.

1719
01:18:26,101 --> 01:18:27,501
You deserve that.

1720
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:30,071
Ben, I was talking about
the business.

1721
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:31,272
No, I know that.
I know that.

1722
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:33,375
But, um...

1723
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:38,345
I understand
what you're going through,

1724
01:18:38,346 --> 01:18:39,947
more than you realize.

1725
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:43,118
Well, then help me understand.

1726
01:18:44,953 --> 01:18:46,821
Uh...

1727
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:48,123
I told you I was engaged, right?

1728
01:18:53,862 --> 01:18:55,731
I don't think I mentioned
that she died.

1729
01:18:57,165 --> 01:18:59,200
Oh... Ben.

1730
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:00,468
That's okay.

1731
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:03,337
It was a long time ago.

1732
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:06,340
But I've been thinking
and, uh...

1733
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:09,910
I think I realized
that, when I started this job,

1734
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:11,947
I got a lot of joy...

1735
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:16,550
from helping people
get their lives back,

1736
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:19,086
but I think
that's maybe because, um,

1737
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:21,389
I couldn't have mine.

1738
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:26,861
Then I met you.

1739
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:28,262
I saw you go through
the same thing.

1740
01:19:30,232 --> 01:19:32,166
You stayed.

1741
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:33,968
You stuck around,
you stuck to it.

1742
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:36,270
You fought for your future.

1743
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:39,374
You helped me realize,
in order to move forward...

1744
01:19:40,876 --> 01:19:43,912
I had to release
some of my past.

1745
01:19:46,348 --> 01:19:48,884
I haven't felt like this
in a long time.

1746
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:52,153
Neither have I.

1747
01:19:52,154 --> 01:19:54,421
I can't ask you to change more
than you already have, okay?

1748
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:56,091
That's not right,
no matter how I feel.

1749
01:19:58,026 --> 01:20:00,262
Well, I think that's up to me.

1750
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:03,597
You're right.

1751
01:20:03,598 --> 01:20:07,301
Maybe it's time
you take your own advice...

1752
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:09,271
and make a few changes yourself.

1753
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:14,276
I wouldn't know where to start.

1754
01:20:16,011 --> 01:20:18,179
Well... you could start

1755
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:21,216
by telling me
how you really feel.

1756
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:11,867
I have something
I'd like to say.

1757
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:15,936
Thank you

1758
01:21:15,937 --> 01:21:19,440
for all of your hard work,
your dedication,

1759
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:21,175
your love,

1760
01:21:21,176 --> 01:21:23,677
over the past three years.

1761
01:21:23,678 --> 01:21:26,146
None of this
would be possible tonight

1762
01:21:26,147 --> 01:21:27,715
if it weren't for each
and every person

1763
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:29,483
here at this table.

1764
01:21:29,484 --> 01:21:32,086
For a long time, I felt like

1765
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:35,422
I needed to be the one
to hold everything together,

1766
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:37,691
but you showed me

1767
01:21:37,692 --> 01:21:41,362
that you've been holding me
all along...

1768
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:43,364
so...

1769
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:47,402
thank you and I love you
and I'm gonna sit down now.

1770
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:50,037
We love you.

1771
01:21:50,038 --> 01:21:52,040
Ti amo.

1772
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:00,648
Everyone...

1773
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:02,216
a toast...

1774
01:22:02,217 --> 01:22:04,452
Everyone.

1775
01:22:05,987 --> 01:22:09,624
To Il Cibo è Vita.

1776
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:13,461
- Saluti!
