[fanfare music]

00:00:36,384 --> 00:00:39,952
My fellow citizens,
our nation has been faced

8
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,173
with a dramatic increase
in terrorism and crime.

9
00:00:43,304 --> 00:00:44,957
That all stops now.

10
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:47,221
From now on,
there will be no pardons.

11
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:48,918
There will be no excuses

12
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,008
for anyone bringing
terror into this state.

13
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:54,402
I attended
this execution to prove

14
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:56,143
to the people
of Florida that I believe

15
00:00:56,273 --> 00:00:58,058
in real punishment,
not empty words.

16
00:00:58,188 --> 00:01:00,799
Fuck you!

17
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,411
Governor, Carol Burke, FSN.
Is the state of Florida

18
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,717
-getting into show business?
-No, Carol.

19
00:01:05,848 --> 00:01:08,372
Marty Rockman is a responsible
television producer.

20
00:01:09,156 --> 00:01:11,114
These people came
to my office with this idea

21
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:12,681
of <i>Citizen Verdict.</i>
I thought it fit in

22
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:14,509
perfectly with
the war against crime

23
00:01:14,639 --> 00:01:14,726
that I've been
leading in our state.

24
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:17,860
That's it. Thank you very much.

25
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,210
[theme music]

26
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,221
I'm Marty Rockman.

27
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,223
I own this station.

28
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,096
But more significantly,
I'm American.

29
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:38,533
And, like you, I am outraged

30
00:01:38,663 --> 00:01:39,882
by the escalating crime

31
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:41,797
that threatens
our civil existence.

32
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:44,756
To be honest,
our justice system has failed.

33
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:46,106
You know it, I know it.

34
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,457
Crime goes unpunished.

35
00:01:49,587 --> 00:01:50,632
Criminals go free.

36
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:53,374
I'm prepared
to offer you change.

37
00:01:53,896 --> 00:01:55,376
With the cooperation
of our Governor

38
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:57,856
from the great state
of Florida, I'm prepared

39
00:01:57,987 --> 00:02:00,381
to give justice back
to you, the citizen,

40
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:04,559
by simply to put justice
back into your hands.

41
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:05,516
Here's what I'm gonna do.

42
00:02:06,387 --> 00:02:08,563
We're gonna televise
criminal trials

43
00:02:08,693 --> 00:02:11,043
in a three hour format, live.

44
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:14,395
And at the end of that trial,
you, the viewer,

45
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:16,701
will get to vote
guilt or innocence.

46
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:19,313
If you vote guilty
in a murder trial,

47
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:21,924
I'm gonna televise
the execution.

48
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:25,101
Our first trial is
Friday night at seven.

49
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:29,888
Justice finally for real.

50
00:02:31,063 --> 00:02:33,718
<i>Citizen Verdict...</i>Be there.

51
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:35,851
[commentator] <i>
That's right. You, the public,</i>

52
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:38,680
<i>will decide which of these</i><i>
three accused murderers,</i>

53
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,334
<i>now awaiting trial</i><i>
in Florida, will be</i>

54
00:02:40,464 --> 00:02:42,510

<i>To vote log on to</i><i>

56
00:03:13,323 --> 00:03:16,979
I rather for it to be
with the 12 man jury

57
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:20,591
while they're sitting there,
they can see the emotions,

58
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:23,855
they can, they can see
everything and then,

59
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:26,554
instead of somebody just on TV,
"Oh, he's not guilty."

60
00:03:26,684 --> 00:03:29,252
Cause they got a whole
bunch of mystery shows on TV,

61
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:32,037
and you can sit back and pick,
"Oh, he's guilty. She's guilty."

62
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,867
You'll be there and see
the actual evidence yourself.

63
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:38,479
I think any time you
have the general population

64
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:41,786
making the decision
rather than a handful
of people who have been tweaked

65
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:43,832
by prosecutors
and defense attorneys,

66
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:44,746
you're not better off.

67
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:45,877
It would definitely...

68
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:49,533
...definitely be big.
I know that. Um...

69
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:51,056
I'll most definitely watch it.

70
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:52,406
If it's not corrupt,

71
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:54,234
I think it would be
a wonderful idea.

72
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:56,888
The problem is a practitioner
that I have with it...

73
00:03:58,063 --> 00:04:00,109
simply is, uh...

74
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:04,853
You're risking
due process violations,

75
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:08,335
um, on a regular basis
in a trial

76
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:10,902
that you show on television,

77
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:13,905
um, under those circumstances.

78
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:17,561
And I'm not sure
if that is worth the gamble.

79
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:19,694
I, I feel that most of

80
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:21,261
the majority
of the reality shows

81
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:24,307
that are out today
are truly exploiting.

82
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:26,831
I think it's
a very strong system,

83
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:29,573
uh, considering
that the United States has,

84
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:31,836
uh, diversity of population.

85
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:35,710
And being a huge country,

86
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,887
they have
to have a powerful system

87
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:40,758
to control the crime.

88
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:43,195
I think in the, uh, the,

89
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:45,981
the system is designed
in a way where they can--

90
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:47,939
It's a demographical situation.

91
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,115
And they can get, they can,
they can go to a certain area

92
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:51,943
and get the type
of people that they want,

93
00:04:52,074 --> 00:04:54,685
and bring on a jury,
and get the verdict they want.

94
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:57,775
So of course I would like
the, the mass of people.

95
00:04:57,906 --> 00:04:59,995
[opening music]

96
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:01,866
Good evening.

97
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:04,478
We're here with Marty Rockman,

98
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:06,784
better known
for the hit reality show,

99
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:07,916
<i>So Sue Me.</i>

100
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:10,440
Marty, I gotta
tell you, [laughs]

101
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:12,790
call it cheesy, I don't care,

102
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:16,011
but I watch <i>
So Sue Me</i>all the time.

103
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:17,839
Well, thank you very much.

104
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:19,057
So tell me about your new show,

105
00:05:19,188 --> 00:05:20,232
<i>Citizen Verdict.</i>

106
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:21,930
Love to do that.
I'd love to do it.

107
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,931
You know, Marty, it is causing

108
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:24,411
a lot of controversy down here

109
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,629
with the public
and in the media.

110
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,414
As expected.

111
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:29,198
And it's set down in Florida?

112
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,114
It's not set in Florida,
it happens in Florida

113
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:35,770
because we're dealing here
with real people
and real justice.

114
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,250
And you're gonna show
real murder trials in Florida?

115
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:40,296
In Tampa.

116
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:42,472
And all registered
Florida voters

117
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:44,953
who watch the show are
eligible to vote on the jury?

118
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,999
That's right. In fact,
we've even set up a system

119
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,175
to make sure
that no one votes twice.

120
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:52,700
Okay. Let's see
what the Republican Governor

121
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,180
of California,
Charlie Behr, has to say.

122
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:56,486
Good evening, Governor.

123
00:05:56,617 --> 00:05:57,705
Hello, Troy.

124
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,142
Governor, what is your take

125
00:06:00,272 --> 00:06:01,273
on what's happening
down in Florida?

126
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:02,797
It's a circus down there.

127
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,888
<i>Citizen Verdict</i>has nothing
to do with justice or democracy.

128
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:08,324
It's a political trick.

129
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:10,674
But more important,
in my opinion,

130
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:12,894
is that it goes
against everything

131
00:06:13,024 --> 00:06:15,853
that the Constitution
of the United States stands for.

132
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:17,159
Excuse me, Governor.

133
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:18,682
[Behr]
No, you wait.

134
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:20,336
Your show is an insult

135
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,164
to the citizens of this country,

136
00:06:22,947 --> 00:06:25,602
Trialing people,
and if convicted, having them

137
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,779
executed on television,
what are you trying to do?

138
00:06:29,476 --> 00:06:32,392
Bring us down to the level
of Iran or Iraq?

139
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,350
And I'm warning you
for the last time,

140
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,570
I've consulted
with my fellow governors

141
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,572
and some of the finest lawyers
in this country,

142
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:41,401
and we intend to obtain
an injunction to stop

143
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:43,359
your show from going on the air.

144
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,580
Run for president on somebody
else's time, Governor.

145
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,931
I'm promising you this,
you might as well write it down

146
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:52,237
nothing and nobody

147
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,849
bring on all
the lawyers you want,

148
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:57,373
nothing is gonna
stop <i>Citizen Verdict</i>

149
00:06:57,504 --> 00:07:00,245
from bringing justice
to the American people.

150
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:03,161
[Tyler]
Marty? What is
this bullshit about a lawsuit?

151
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,425
Is Governor Behr
trying to kill our show?

152
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:07,470
[Marty]
Relax, Bull. He's just
playing the press.

153
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:08,993
[Bull laughs]

154
00:07:09,124 --> 00:07:11,300
You don't know
dick about politics.

155
00:07:11,953 --> 00:07:14,434
That man is gonna
challenge me for the primaries.

156
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:17,045
Your lawyers are gonna
keep me in the loop.

157
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:19,003
I wanna know everything
that's going on

158
00:07:19,134 --> 00:07:20,178
at every minute. Let's eat.

159
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,137
Oh, this is good.

160
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:25,009
Excuse me. Thank you.

161
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:27,882
So...

162
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,710
How's the voting go?

163
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,407
Well, I can tell you
who's gonna win.

164
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:33,104
Ricky Carr is way
out ahead in the vote.

165
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,586
Of course, it's a...
it's celebrity murder.

166
00:07:36,717 --> 00:07:38,675
Well, Dolly Hamilton, let's
face it, she was an icon.

167
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:41,112
What kind of numbers
are we looking at?

168
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:43,158
Four million,
maybe five, in Florida

169
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:45,116
-in terms of the viewers.
-Listen, Marty...

170
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:47,858
Don't fuck up.

171
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:51,427
This has got to be a good thing
for the state of Florida

172
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:53,777
and the United States.
Got to be done right.

173
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:56,606
If this young punk walks,
if this case doesn't hold

174
00:07:56,737 --> 00:07:58,434
I'm gonna look
like a wimpy asshole.

175
00:07:58,565 --> 00:08:01,263
My neck's on the line

-No, I live with my mom.
-Okay.

gonna do that show, though.

I'll tell you what.
Let me think about it, huh?

213
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:19,471
Why don't you
give me your résumé?

-All right.

Okay.

All right, come on up.

Alright. Memorize that.

I got a ton of money
invested in the show.

252
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:18,155

who's been on my case
the whole time.

255
00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:22,682
So, number one,

256
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,510
you never talk to the press.

257
00:11:25,641 --> 00:11:27,251
All statements run through me.

258

Got it? I got to keep
consistency of message.

259
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:32,039
And, number two,
this is show business.

260
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:34,519
I didn't hire you just
because you're great attorney.

261

It's always
about the money, isn't?
I know where you're coming from.

I got two ex-wives.
They're tapping me for money.

We can work with that.

if taking this gamble

00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:10,300
-New York.
-Where in New York?

347
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:11,736
Starrett City.

348
00:15:13,086 --> 00:15:13,913
Do you like baseball?

349
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:17,481
Yeah. I like baseball.

350
00:15:18,787 --> 00:15:20,136
So, Carr, you're a prostitute.

351
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,792
You got a record
the size of Starrett City.

352
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:28,101
And I've examined
this case from top to bottom.

353
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,191
Should I be here right now?

354
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:38,241
I told my story
to the cops a 1000 times.

355
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,243
Do you wanna tell me
you history?

356
00:15:41,244 --> 00:15:42,071
'Cause that's why we're here.

357
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,950
Why don't you tell me
how much the TV company's
paying you to represent me?

358
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,255
I ain't getting paid
by you, son.

359
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,348
All right, thanks for your time.

360
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:04,615
Mr. Patterson?

361
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:11,535
You wouldn't believe
my story if I told you.

362
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:15,626
[melancholic music]

363
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:22,155
[beep]

364
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:32,339
I was just sitting
at the bar having a drink.

365
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:35,385
The place is called Chucho's.

366
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:37,997
I always go there
on a Friday night.

367
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:41,870
That's when she came in.

368
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:43,959
Dolly Hamilton.

369
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:48,746
She's coming on
straight away, you know?

370
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:50,487
Pushy.

371
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:52,446
She puts...

372
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:54,796
She puts
a 100 dollars into my...

373
00:16:55,623 --> 00:16:56,537
on my dick.

374
00:16:57,277 --> 00:16:59,888
She wants me to fuck
in the car, like, right now.

375
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:01,890
That's what she wanted.

376
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:06,199
The car was parked
right outside the club.

377
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:07,896
And...

378
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:10,638
We drive someplace quiet.
She says she wants

379
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:12,727
to fuck tough
right there in the car.

380
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:14,816
Wants me to rip her up a bit.

381
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,603
You know, and I said
that's no big deal,

382
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:21,083
as long as no cops are around.

383
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:25,435
We fuck, and she
gives me 300 more.

384
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,047
End of story.

385
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:31,050
Then she came back a week later.

386
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:36,577
This, like, happened every week

387
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:39,014
for, like, three weeks
maybe, you know?

388
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:40,363
Always in the outfield.

389
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:42,365
Always someplace quiet, dark.

390
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:46,021
And that night...

391
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,373
...we went down
to a parking garage.

392
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,725
She said she
wanted it rough, you know?

393
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:57,032
Blood, pain and that shit.

394
00:17:57,946 --> 00:17:59,295
And I'm not into that, yeah?

395
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,602
But then she didn't wanna pay.

396
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:06,433
So she takes my hand,

397
00:18:06,563 --> 00:18:08,087
and she puts it on the blade

398
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:10,872
and gets me fucking her.

399
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,136
And she's getting into it.

400
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:17,096
[sobs]

401
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:19,837
The blade's right
up here on her throat.

402
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:21,665
[sobs]

403
00:18:22,753 --> 00:18:23,624
[sobs]

404
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,714
And then
it kind of just went in.

405
00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:29,151
[sobs]

406
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:34,200
And then the blood.

407
00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:36,202
[sniffs]

408
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:37,942
Just waiting for you there.

409
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:41,946
I was so freaked I just...

410
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:43,905
I just ran fast.

411
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:44,949
[inaudible]

412
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:49,215
[inaudible]

413
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:52,174
Fucked up.

414
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:56,874
I took her necklace too.

415
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,315
I wasn't even thinking
straight. I just needed

416
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:03,838
the dough
and I took the necklace.

417
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:11,628
I didn't even know
I had the blade in my hand

418
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,152
till I got back to my place.

419
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:18,635
Then it was too late.

420
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,207
[beep]

421
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:36,349
[seagulls cawing]

422
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:47,751
No, no, no way.
You cannot do this.

423
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:50,624
-He might be innocent
and I need time.
-Absolutely not.

424
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:52,539
You think I'm gonna
give you time to slime up

425
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:54,193
-Dolly Hamilton's character?
-Are we talking

426
00:19:54,323 --> 00:19:55,846
-about justice here?
-Oh, come on, Sam.

427
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:57,457
I am talking about justice.

428
00:19:57,587 --> 00:19:59,067
Well, how about talking about
some due process of law?

429
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,852
Due process? You know
that my case is airtight.

430
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:04,420
-If we had the surveillance
tape, it'd just be one--
-I don't know what the hell

431
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:06,030
you're you talking about now.
No one's talking about tapes.

432
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:07,249
You haven't talked to the cops.

433
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,685
You know, this is
beginning to sound

434
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:09,773
real goddamn convenient to me.

435
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:13,473
This was not factored
into the deal here.

436
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:15,431
Sam, I cannot
give you any more time

437
00:20:15,562 --> 00:20:16,954
according to the rules.

438
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,088
-Marty?
-Sam, I'd love to help you.

439
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,655
But we're locked into the 12th.

440
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:24,353
I got a network on me a PR
machine, not to mention

441
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:26,181
Governor Behr trying
to shut the whole thing down.

442
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:28,227
If you need some help,
tell me what you need.

443
00:20:28,357 --> 00:20:29,706
Oh, shit.

444
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:31,534
Give me some more, huh?

445
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:34,276
This is beginning to hurt.

[Sarah]
Hi, Dad!

447
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:45,200
Hey, baby. How are you, huh?

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,507
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye, sweetie.

00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:51,772
Hi, how're you doing?

450
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:52,773
Yeah, I'm alright.

451
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:55,123
I saw you on TV.

452
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,343
Quite a PR campaign.

453
00:20:57,473 --> 00:20:58,344
Yeah.

454
00:20:58,822 --> 00:20:59,954
What are you trying to prove

455
00:21:00,084 --> 00:21:01,216
that you haven't already?

456
00:21:01,347 --> 00:21:03,479
I-- Who are
you trying to impress?

457
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:06,482
Remember to bring
Sarah's computer?

458
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:08,049
Don't change the subject.

459
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:10,660
And, please, look at me
when you're talking to me.

460
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:15,099
What do you want from me, huh?

461
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,798
You wanted a divorce,

462
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:19,408
you got a divorce.

463
00:21:20,757 --> 00:21:21,584
You wanted the house,

464
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:23,760
you got the house.

465
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:26,807
-Now what else do
you want from me, Mmh?
-Sam...

466
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:29,636
You've forgotten
who you really are

467
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,552
and people
who really care for you.

468
00:21:32,682 --> 00:21:34,031
You lost me to your career.

469
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:36,469
What do you think
your daughter's gonna think

470
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:39,036
when she sees you
on that stupid TV show?

471
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:41,343
Please, don't ever question
my integrity as a father, Anna,

472
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:42,649
or as a lawyer for that matter.

473
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:45,042
Please, huh? It's beneath you.

474
00:21:45,913 --> 00:21:48,263
Anyway, you're gonna do
what you want. You always have.

475
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:49,264
Look.

476
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:52,180
My parents want
to have a dinner at the house

477
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,660
next week for Sarah's birthday.

478
00:21:54,225 --> 00:21:55,183
They want you there.

479
00:21:56,402 --> 00:21:57,272
That's great.

480
00:21:58,142 --> 00:21:59,970
Now that I'm on TV,
I get invited for dinner, huh?

481
00:22:00,449 --> 00:22:02,016
Yeah, whatever.

482
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:03,017
Bye.

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,594
-Mr. Patterson.
-Hey! Thank you for meeting
with me, Michael.

486
00:22:14,724 --> 00:22:15,812
No problem. Follow me.

487
00:22:17,684 --> 00:22:20,164
-So these are
the production offices, huh?
-That's right.

488
00:22:20,774 --> 00:22:23,167
-How long've you worked for her?
-Three long years.

489
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:26,083
For low, low wages
and lots of abuse.

490
00:22:26,214 --> 00:22:27,084
Hello, darling.

491
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:30,523
What did you do for her,
Michael? You were
a production designer?

492
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:33,787
Production designer, made
secretary, housewife. All that.

493
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:35,484
-Yeah. All that stuff, huh?
-Yeah.

494
00:22:35,615 --> 00:22:36,746
-You know her will?
-Oh, yeah.

495
00:22:36,877 --> 00:22:38,313
I thought it was
kind of hard to miss.

496
00:22:38,444 --> 00:22:39,793
-Yeah?
-Especially when you work
for the bitch.

497
00:22:41,621 --> 00:22:43,144
You think she had
much of a personal life?

498
00:22:43,971 --> 00:22:46,452
No. Cooking, cooking, cooking.

499
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:47,888
You don't think
she had any boyfriends?

500
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:49,063
-Boyfriends? Dolly?
-Yeah.

501
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:51,544
-I don't think so.
-You don't think so?

502
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:53,546
-Or you don't know?
-I don't know.

503
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:54,895
And I don't want to know. Okay?

504
00:22:56,984 --> 00:22:57,854
I understand.

505
00:22:58,638 --> 00:22:59,900
[Landers]
So how are you?

506
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:02,598
How am I? Um...

507
00:23:03,338 --> 00:23:04,470
[clicks tongue]

508
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,514
Well, I...

509
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:08,038
I can't go out of my house.

510
00:23:10,998 --> 00:23:13,522
I can't open the front door
without a camera in my face,

511
00:23:13,653 --> 00:23:16,307
without a, a camera
in my, uh, children's faces.

512
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:17,308
So, um...

513
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:20,311
Yeah, uh, that's, uh...

514
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:24,315
-That's how I am...
-Yeah. Okay.

515
00:23:26,535 --> 00:23:29,495
Um, you know, I know this
is a difficult time for you.

516
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:31,932
Um...

517
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,545
But, um, I'm gonna
have to ask you some...

518
00:23:37,894 --> 00:23:39,069
...questions about Dolly.

519
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:43,073
Um...

520
00:23:44,553 --> 00:23:45,728
Personal questions.

521

what everybody is on, on TV.

Um...

528
00:24:02,745 --> 00:24:05,835
Something came up in a meeting
with the defense attorney.

529
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:11,014
Um... In trial they're
gonna try to introduce some...

What kind of sexual things
are they talking about?

536
00:24:30,817 --> 00:24:33,210
They are alleging that Dolly

537
00:24:33,776 --> 00:24:37,084
frequented bars and indulged

538
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:40,043
in sadomasochistic sex
with male prostitutes.

539
00:24:48,748 --> 00:24:50,924
Ms. Landers, I want you
to go out there...

540
00:24:52,012 --> 00:24:54,014
...and make sure that man dies.

541
00:24:58,888 --> 00:25:01,412
Television lies.
Television, the, the media

542
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:04,415
only gives you half the story,
and they'll blow it up,
and give you something else.

543
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:06,461
You won't be getting the full
truth, so, I'm not gonna rely

544
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:08,811
on what the media say.
I need to find out for myself.

545
00:25:08,942 --> 00:25:11,248
I need to get the, the
information on the case myself,

546
00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:13,512
and see what's really going on.
Because the media television is

547
00:25:13,642 --> 00:25:16,340
just a big-- most
of that stuff, whatever is
just a big lie anyway.

548
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:17,907
So I, I'm not
gonna go with that.

549
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,910
There's too much, uh,
expansions with the media.

550
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:23,913
Whether it be television,
newspapers, radio.

551
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:26,133
Uh, by the time they,
they get somebody to trial,

552
00:25:26,263 --> 00:25:27,569

or they're innocent.

About six months back.

And?

698
00:34:07,871 --> 00:34:09,308
Is it sunny? I...

00:34:10,787 --> 00:34:12,050
<i>I can hear seagulls.</i>

700
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,051
Yeah.

701
00:34:14,182 --> 00:34:15,140
Yeah, they make a lot of noise.

702
00:34:16,402 --> 00:34:17,229
No.

703
00:34:17,881 --> 00:34:18,795
It's a nice noise.

704
00:34:22,016 --> 00:34:23,191
You gotta hang in there, Ricky.

705
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:26,542
You hang tough. You hear me?

706
00:34:28,588 --> 00:34:29,458
Yeah.

707
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:31,678
Yeah. Thanks.

00:35:14,286 --> 00:35:16,984
Welcome to <i>Citizen Verdict,</i>
where you are the jury.

-This is Didi Ray,

714
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,512
outside the <i>Citizen Verdict</i>
studios, in Tampa, Florida...

715
00:35:24,296 --> 00:35:26,994
The crowd, listen
to this hype. It's crazy.

716
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,778
Absolutely wild.

["Take The A Train"
by Billy Strayhorn]

718
00:35:33,522 --> 00:35:36,960
Here we have the prosecuting
attorney, Jessica Landers.

719
00:35:37,091 --> 00:35:38,832
And she has with her in the car

720
00:35:38,962 --> 00:35:41,617
the victim 's husband,
Jack Hamilton.

721
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:44,577
Oh, my goodness!
Jack, do you think

722
00:35:44,707 --> 00:35:46,405
justice will be served tonight?

723
00:35:46,535 --> 00:35:48,058
I really,
I really have no comment.

724
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:51,366
Jessica, Jessica,
are you gonna beat Sam tonight?

725
00:35:51,497 --> 00:35:53,542
I'm gonna beat Sam,
and justice will be served,

726
00:35:53,673 --> 00:35:55,892
-and I will be the one doing it.
-Wow!

727
00:35:56,023 --> 00:35:58,765
Oh, my gosh!
And here comes the man himself.

728
00:35:58,895 --> 00:36:02,247
That's exciting,
this wild, wild anticipation.

729
00:36:02,377 --> 00:36:06,076
Sam, this is the premier
of <i>Citizen Verdict.</i>

730
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,905
Look at the crowd. Look at
the hype. How are you feeling?

731
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,170
-I can't comment.
-Rumors are flying

732
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,434
that explosive revelations
will be made at the trial.

733
00:36:15,564 --> 00:36:17,175
Can you comment on this?

734
00:36:18,306 --> 00:36:20,221
Good luck, Sam!
This is Didi Ray,

735
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:24,617

What you think,
that trials and executions

738
00:36:31,972 --> 00:36:34,540
will make the United States
more uncivilized?

739
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:37,543
I don't really think a country
like France has anything

740
00:36:37,673 --> 00:36:40,459
to teach the United States
about a crime rate.

741
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,680
But here in Florida
we're going to take a stand
against the crime rate.

742
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,118
And <i>Citizen Verdict</i>
is just the tool we need.

743
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:49,642

This is it, huh?

747
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:56,953
This is history.

[cheering]

753
00:37:38,604 --> 00:37:40,910
Tonight's case is
The People versus Ricky Carr.

754
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:43,391
Here comes the defendant,
who is accused of the rape

755
00:37:43,522 --> 00:37:45,872
and first degree murder
of Dolly Hamilton.

756
00:37:46,002 --> 00:37:48,440
-Here's how it will go.
-The trial will
last three hours.

757
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,224
After that, you will
have one hour to reach

758
00:37:50,355 --> 00:37:52,008
your verdict
before the lines shut down.

759
00:37:52,574 --> 00:37:54,881
When you call, simply follow
the automated instructions

The accounting firm

762
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,455
will monitor
and certify the voting.

763
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:06,066
A unanimous result
is of course not possible.

764
00:38:06,196 --> 00:38:10,113
[Tawny]
And so the defendant can only
be found guilty if more than 75%

765
00:38:10,244 --> 00:38:13,160
-of you reach that decision.
-Presiding at tonight's trial

Judge Thomas A. Halvern.

All rise for the honorable
Judge Thomas A. Halvern.

768
00:38:20,602 --> 00:38:22,038
[judge]
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury.

769
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:25,041
Before we begin...

770
00:38:26,086 --> 00:38:28,262
...I ask you to remember
that you are watching

771
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:30,308
this trial on television...

772
00:38:31,613 --> 00:38:32,658
...but it is real.

773
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:37,315
A man is on trial
for a real crime.

774
00:38:38,054 --> 00:38:39,839
It is your solemn duty

775
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:42,276
to observe the proceedings
without bias.

776
00:38:44,017 --> 00:38:47,150
Each and every one of you,
the jury, must watch

777
00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:48,935
every moment of this trial

778
00:38:49,718 --> 00:38:52,155
and pay close attention
to everything

779
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:54,114
you see and hear.

780
00:38:55,637 --> 00:38:56,464
Remember...

781
00:38:58,423 --> 00:39:00,033
You will be
sitting in judgment

782
00:39:00,729 --> 00:39:02,427
at the conclusion of this trial.

783
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:03,950
Come on, Judge. Pick it up.

784
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,778
I call upon the prosecution

785
00:39:05,908 --> 00:39:07,301
to make their opening statement.

786
00:39:07,432 --> 00:39:08,346
[Landers]
Thank you, your Honor.

787
00:39:11,653 --> 00:39:14,395
Dolly Hamilton. [chuckles]

788
00:39:15,222 --> 00:39:16,745
Who could forget that smile?

789
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:20,662
Well, she brought
America into our home...

790
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:25,754
...taught us the pleasures of
good, plain, American cooking.

791
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:27,452
She wrote books...

792
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:29,845
...had her own magazine.

793
00:39:32,674 --> 00:39:34,328
She was a TV icon.

794
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,636
Dolly Hamilton was someone I,

795
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:40,073
[chuckles] oh,

796
00:39:40,726 --> 00:39:43,119
we all aspired to be.

797
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:45,774
She was a loving mother...

798
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,516
...a devoted wife.

799
00:39:48,647 --> 00:39:51,171
Dolly Hamilton was an ideal...

800
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:53,782
...for millions of Americans.

You know what?

806
00:40:16,065 --> 00:40:18,198
Dolly won't be coming
home for Christmas this year.

807
00:40:20,374 --> 00:40:21,244
Or next year.

808
00:40:23,943 --> 00:40:24,813
Or ever again.

809
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,643
Because one night...

810
00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:31,516
...the dream...

811
00:40:32,691 --> 00:40:33,518
...was over.

812
00:40:36,346 --> 00:40:38,871
Dolly's life
was brutally cut short

813
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:40,568
when Ricky Carr attacked,

814
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:43,528
viciously raped
and murdered her.

815
00:40:44,137 --> 00:40:47,053
And for what? A necklace.

816
00:40:48,837 --> 00:40:49,882
[scoffs]

817
00:40:53,276 --> 00:40:57,585
We will show irrefutable
DNA and forensic evidence,

818
00:40:57,716 --> 00:40:59,631
Ricky Carr's fingerprints
on her vehicle,

819
00:40:59,761 --> 00:41:00,719
and the murder weapon.

820
00:41:01,197 --> 00:41:04,853
Jurors... this is
an open and shut case.

821
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:08,944
The prosecution will prove
beyond any reasonable doubt

822
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:10,468
that Ricky Carr is guilty

823
00:41:11,033 --> 00:41:11,904
of rape,

824
00:41:12,818 --> 00:41:14,297
first degree murder,

825
00:41:14,428 --> 00:41:16,386
and deserves
to be sentenced to death.

826
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:18,606
[background chatter]

827
00:41:27,441 --> 00:41:28,660
Well, ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

828
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:30,226
I have to congratulate you.

829
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:31,880
Because you're the first.

830
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:34,883
You're the first
television jury system

831
00:41:35,014 --> 00:41:36,363
in the history of this nation

832
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:38,017
to ever try a case.

833
00:41:38,147 --> 00:41:38,974
That's phenomenal.

834
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:41,324
That is an astonishing...

835
00:41:42,108 --> 00:41:42,935
...responsibility.

836
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,328
It's an astonishing opportunity.

837
00:41:45,894 --> 00:41:46,721
[chuckles]

838
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:48,854
This is exciting.

839
00:41:49,898 --> 00:41:50,856
This is exciting.

840
00:41:51,334 --> 00:41:53,206
[chuckles] I wanna pose

841
00:41:53,336 --> 00:41:55,774
a question to you. Why do we
love our children so much?

842
00:41:55,904 --> 00:41:57,123
They play, don't they?

843
00:41:57,253 --> 00:41:58,124
They experiment.

844
00:41:59,342 --> 00:42:00,561
You know, when you bring
a kid into the world,

845
00:42:00,692 --> 00:42:01,954
you want to be
the total manifestation

846
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:04,304
of your hopes...
and your values.

847
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:07,960
You live with that inherent
obligation and privilege

848
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:10,266
to never fail that child.

849
00:42:11,877 --> 00:42:13,139
You never fail that child.

850
00:42:14,009 --> 00:42:15,271
I feel that way about democracy.

851
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,665
I feel that way
about this justice system.

852
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:20,538
This is a phenomenon.

853
00:42:22,148 --> 00:42:23,105
This justice system.

854
00:42:24,454 --> 00:42:25,760
It's like a child.

855
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,328
It's always challenging us.
It's always growing.

856
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:30,678
It's always evolving.
It's always questioning us.

857
00:42:30,809 --> 00:42:32,375
It's demanding the best of us.

858
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:35,857
But we still live
with the obligation

859
00:42:35,988 --> 00:42:38,381
to never fail that child.

860
00:42:39,992 --> 00:42:40,862
You just don't do that.

861
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:44,039
[chuckles] Look.

862
00:42:45,084 --> 00:42:45,954
[chuckles]

863
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,913
I'm the defense attorney here.

864
00:42:48,043 --> 00:42:50,263
If I fail before you,
I fail before this nation.

865
00:42:50,393 --> 00:42:51,481
But my client,

866
00:42:52,134 --> 00:42:54,223
Ricky Dean Carr, has already

867
00:42:54,876 --> 00:42:56,748
admitted to the killing
of Dolly.

868
00:42:58,097 --> 00:42:58,924
He admitted it.

869
00:43:00,534 --> 00:43:01,622
It was an accident.

870
00:43:01,753 --> 00:43:03,842
[background chatter]

871
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:06,192
It was a tragic accident.

872
00:43:09,717 --> 00:43:10,631
I'm sorry.

873
00:43:10,762 --> 00:43:11,719
[clicks tongue] Shit.

874
00:43:12,677 --> 00:43:13,852
Where is the video?

875
00:43:13,982 --> 00:43:15,157
-Here, sir.
-Where?

876
00:43:16,245 --> 00:43:17,551
Yeah. Could you just...

877
00:43:18,508 --> 00:43:20,249
Could you, please,
put, put a, a...

878
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,425
Where's Dolly? Come on.

879
00:43:22,556 --> 00:43:23,470
Get Dolly up there.

880
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:24,906
Where is Dolly?

881
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:27,822
Hello, Dolly. There she is.

882
00:43:27,953 --> 00:43:29,084
I want to tell you a story.

883
00:43:31,043 --> 00:43:33,132
About seven years ago, I am
in the middle of a divorce,

884
00:43:34,307 --> 00:43:35,830
I'm sitting in my boat,
it's all I have left.

885
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,180
I'm watching one
of these little televisions,

886
00:43:39,225 --> 00:43:40,139
on comes Dolly.

887
00:43:41,575 --> 00:43:42,445
Now I wanna tell you something.

888
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,144
Dolly represented to me

889
00:43:45,971 --> 00:43:46,928
everything at that moment

890
00:43:47,755 --> 00:43:49,061
that I was lacking in my life.

891
00:43:49,191 --> 00:43:50,105
You know what?

892
00:43:50,889 --> 00:43:52,586
Where is that camera
that looks like an octopus?

893
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:54,762
Octopus who? Let--

894
00:43:54,893 --> 00:43:56,285
Hey, honey, bring that
camera over here, will you?

895
00:43:56,416 --> 00:43:57,635
-Put the camera to him.
-Get it on her.

896
00:43:57,765 --> 00:43:59,071
Put the octopus in her face.

897
00:43:59,201 --> 00:44:00,594
Come on, get it up there.

898
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:05,643
Tonight we're gonna
listen to testimony...

899
00:44:07,035 --> 00:44:08,341
...that damns this woman,

900
00:44:09,211 --> 00:44:12,214
that vilifies
that lacerates this face

901
00:44:12,345 --> 00:44:13,259
<i>that we all love and adore.</i>

902
00:44:13,389 --> 00:44:15,522
[chatter]

903
00:44:16,001 --> 00:44:17,524
We have to sit
through witnesses.

904
00:44:19,439 --> 00:44:21,659
And the state will try to prove

905
00:44:21,789 --> 00:44:23,878
that my client, Ricky Carr,

906
00:44:25,097 --> 00:44:27,665
raped and murdered
Mrs. Hamilton...

907
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:30,450
...and they'll fail.

908
00:44:32,408 --> 00:44:33,279
It was an accident.

909
00:44:36,325 --> 00:44:37,196
Thank you.

910
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,984
Wow, wow, wow! We were promised
some explosive evidence,

911
00:44:43,115 --> 00:44:45,030
and it looks like
we're going to get it.

912
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,814
-What do you think, Jeff?
-I think you're right, Tony.

913
00:44:46,945 --> 00:44:48,729
This is going to be
a really tough case.

914
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,513
Obviously a big fight
is in the works.

915
00:44:50,644 --> 00:44:53,473
Well, the opening statements are
complete, and after the break

916
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:55,431
the prosecution
will present its case.

917
00:44:55,562 --> 00:44:56,781
[Jeff] <i>
Stay with us.</i>

918
00:44:56,911 --> 00:44:59,000
[chatter]

919
00:45:00,001 --> 00:45:02,090
[chatter]

920
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:09,228
[Landers]
So, this proves conclusively
that the semen samples

921
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:12,753
taken from inside Mrs. Hamilton
comes from the defendant.

922
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:16,496
[expert]
I consider 1 in 12 billion
to be conclusive, yes.

923
00:45:16,626 --> 00:45:17,497
Thank you.

924
00:45:18,063 --> 00:45:18,933
Defense's witness.

925
00:45:19,586 --> 00:45:20,848
[Sam]
Well, this certainly sounds

926
00:45:20,979 --> 00:45:22,067
conclusive, Mr. Doby.

927
00:45:23,242 --> 00:45:24,678
But the DNA proved
that it was rape.

928
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:26,549
There was definite
trauma present.

929
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,639
I'd say rape is
a strong possibility.

930
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,119
Possibility or certainty?

931
00:45:31,598 --> 00:45:34,122
-Possibility.
-Possible is not for certain,

932
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:35,645
is it, Mr. Doby?

933
00:45:36,472 --> 00:45:38,518
-No.
-Thank you.
No further questions.

934
00:45:38,648 --> 00:45:41,347
Redirect, your Honor.
From your experience,

935
00:45:41,477 --> 00:45:44,959
how often do these signs
of trauma indicate rape?

936
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:47,614
-95% of the time.
-[Sam] Objection, your Honor.

937
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,964
There's no corroborating
proof to back these statistics.

938
00:45:50,486 --> 00:45:52,532
-[judge] Ms. Landers.
-Withdraw the question.

939
00:45:53,663 --> 00:45:54,534
Mr. Doby...

940
00:45:55,361 --> 00:45:57,015
...how long have you been
a forensics expert?

941
00:45:57,842 --> 00:46:01,019
-Eighteen years.
-And when you offer an opinion,

942
00:46:01,149 --> 00:46:04,283
as you just did,
even if it entails conjecture,

943
00:46:04,936 --> 00:46:07,982
-is it based on your
experience as a forensic--
-Objection, your Honor.

944
00:46:08,113 --> 00:46:10,202
She's just manipulated
the previous question.

945
00:46:10,332 --> 00:46:12,682
95% is not good enough.
Could be 40.

946
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:15,120
Could be 60. Could be 10.
Can you prove me wrong?

947
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:16,991
Your Honor,
Mr. Patterson is out of order.

948
00:46:17,122 --> 00:46:19,211
-He's using his objection--
-No, you're out of order.

949
00:46:19,341 --> 00:46:22,997
...manipulating this television.
And I'll not allow it.

950
00:46:23,128 --> 00:46:25,391
-And I'll not stand for it.
-Yes.

951
00:46:25,521 --> 00:46:26,566
-[Sam] You should know better--
-Enough!

952
00:46:28,873 --> 00:46:29,743
Objection sustained.

953
00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:31,658
You're both grandstanding

954
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,181
and I will not tolerate it.

955
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:35,096
Go on, Ms. Landers.

956
00:46:36,271 --> 00:46:38,404
Thank you sir. The prosecution

957
00:46:38,534 --> 00:46:39,884
calls Jack Hamilton.

958
00:46:40,014 --> 00:46:40,841
Thank you, Mr. Doby.

959
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:47,369
Jay, close up.

960
00:46:47,979 --> 00:46:48,806
Tighter two...

961
00:46:50,982 --> 00:46:52,461
[buzz]

962
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:59,381
[Landers]
Mr. Hamilton,
I'm sorry about your loss.

963
00:46:59,512 --> 00:47:01,035
America loved your late wife.

964
00:47:02,341 --> 00:47:04,865
But I'm gonna have to ask you
some difficult questions.

965
00:47:06,345 --> 00:47:07,389
Mr. Hamilton...

966
00:47:09,043 --> 00:47:11,350
I'm sure you've heard
the stories about Dolly

967
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,656
circulating in the,
shall we say,

968
00:47:13,787 --> 00:47:15,920
-trashier end of the press.
-[sighs]

969
00:47:16,398 --> 00:47:18,966
[Landers]
Is it conceivable... at all...

970
00:47:20,185 --> 00:47:22,056
...that there is any truth

971
00:47:22,665 --> 00:47:24,189
to these abhorrent rumors?

972
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:25,581
Absolutely not.

973
00:47:27,757 --> 00:47:31,022
[sighs] Dolly was the most
wonderful woman in the world.

974
00:47:32,153 --> 00:47:34,547
-I don't know how I'm gonna
live without her.
-[Sam] Objection, your Honor.

975
00:47:34,677 --> 00:47:36,592
This, this is
completely irrelevant.

976
00:47:37,158 --> 00:47:40,770
-That piece of shit
over there raped my wife--
-[judge] Mr. Hamilton.

977
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,990
Please, control yourself.

978
00:47:43,643 --> 00:47:47,255
Your Honor,
the defense has told us
in their opening statement

979
00:47:47,386 --> 00:47:49,127
that their case
is circumstantial.

980
00:47:50,302 --> 00:47:52,260
They have warned the jury
that they will try

981
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:54,262
to attack
Dolly Hamilton's character.

982
00:47:54,393 --> 00:47:57,265
Now I believe in my obligation
to present an objective picture.

983
00:47:57,396 --> 00:48:00,747
And who better to do it
than Dolly Hamilton's husband,

984
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:04,185
who knew and lived
with her for 30 years.

985
00:48:04,316 --> 00:48:06,884
-Fair is fair, your Honor.
-[judge] Objection overruled.

986
00:48:07,623 --> 00:48:08,581
Go on. Miss Landers.

987
00:48:08,711 --> 00:48:09,756
Thank you, your Honor.

988
00:48:13,107 --> 00:48:15,936
Mr. Hamilton, you were
telling us about your wife.

989
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:18,765
[clicks tongue and sighs]

990
00:48:19,374 --> 00:48:21,246
I, I have just lost my wife.

991
00:48:23,074 --> 00:48:24,902
My children have
just lost their mother.

992
00:48:27,643 --> 00:48:28,514
[sobs]

993
00:48:29,689 --> 00:48:32,822
[stutters] Dolly was
the finest woman I ever knew.

994
00:48:33,562 --> 00:48:35,782
[sniffs and sobs]

995
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,479
[sobbing]

996
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,138
[Landers]
No further questions.

997
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:47,750
-[judge] Mr. Patterson.
-No.

998
00:48:49,578 --> 00:48:50,666
No further questions,
your Honor.

999
00:48:57,238 --> 00:48:59,327
[chattering]

1000
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:04,463
[Sam]
Mr. Turner, how did
you meet Mrs. Hamilton?

1001
00:49:04,593 --> 00:49:05,943
[stutters] Yeah, we, uh...

1002
00:49:06,552 --> 00:49:07,945
She picked me up
in a bar one night.

1003
00:49:08,467 --> 00:49:10,164
Took me to this,
uh, motel nearby.

1004
00:49:12,036 --> 00:49:13,472
Tell us what occurred, sir.

1005
00:49:13,602 --> 00:49:16,779
Uh, well, we started
to fuck, so then she--

1006
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:19,043
Mr. Turner,
you're in a court of law.

1007
00:49:19,173 --> 00:49:21,480
Now kindly answer the question
without profanity.

1008
00:49:22,046 --> 00:49:23,395
Yeah. Okay, sure. Um...

1009
00:49:24,439 --> 00:49:26,876
We started to, uh, make love.

1010
00:49:27,486 --> 00:49:29,749
And then she handed me
these cuffs. All that stuff.

1011
00:49:30,228 --> 00:49:33,187
-What stuff sir?
-Wanted me to handcuff her
to the bed. Uh...

1012
00:49:34,188 --> 00:49:36,582
Then she wanted to be burned
with cigarettes on her, uh...

1013
00:49:37,757 --> 00:49:39,759
You know? She was in a...

1014
00:49:39,889 --> 00:49:41,804
-[crowd shouts]
-[Landers] Objection,
your Honor.

1015
00:49:41,935 --> 00:49:44,938
You Honor,
this is a valid testimony
to corroborate my client's case.

1016
00:49:45,069 --> 00:49:46,461
My apologies to this court.

1017
00:49:47,201 --> 00:49:49,116
-[judge] Objection overruled.
-Are you sure you want me

1018
00:49:49,247 --> 00:49:50,509
to say all this shit in court?

1019
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:52,859
Now, Mr. Turner,
you've been warned.

1020
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,687
-Continue, sir.
-[Turner] Okay. Yeah.

1021
00:49:55,514 --> 00:49:58,038
So, well then, she,
she wanted me to fu-- uh,

1022
00:49:58,169 --> 00:49:59,126
make love to her.

1023
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,955
-She wanted it up the ass.
-Objection!

1024
00:50:02,086 --> 00:50:04,523
[judge] I assume
you had no time

1025
00:50:04,653 --> 00:50:06,177
to prepare your witness
for this case.

1026
00:50:06,307 --> 00:50:09,049
Now, kindly do
something about it.

1027
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,356
Or I'll hold
your witness in contempt.

1028
00:50:11,486 --> 00:50:13,010
Basically,
what you're saying, Mr. Turner,

1029
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,099
is that you had
sadomasochistic relations

1030
00:50:15,229 --> 00:50:16,883
with this woman,
is that correct, sir?

1031
00:50:17,623 --> 00:50:19,668
-Sado what?
-No further questions.

1032
00:50:21,192 --> 00:50:24,543
-Ms. Landers.
-Your Honor, I will not dignify

1033
00:50:24,673 --> 00:50:26,980
this witness
with a cross examination.

1034
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:29,330
There is no proof
to back up his story.

1035
00:50:29,461 --> 00:50:33,073
And so I see no reason
why his testimony

1036
00:50:33,204 --> 00:50:35,075
should be entered
into the record.

1037
00:50:35,206 --> 00:50:37,251
[judge]
Very well,
Miss Landers, however,

1038
00:50:37,382 --> 00:50:40,037
Mr. Turner's testimony
will stand.

1039
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,129
[tense music]

1040
00:50:50,264 --> 00:50:52,353
[unintelligible chatter]

1041
00:51:00,883 --> 00:51:03,495
Mr. Carr, you've heard the
testimony here of Mr. Turner.

1042
00:51:05,584 --> 00:51:07,586
-Sound familiar?
-Yeah.

1043
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:11,198
Could you tell the court,
in your own words now,

1044
00:51:11,329 --> 00:51:14,201
how you came to meet...
Mrs. Hamilton?

1045
00:51:15,594 --> 00:51:18,858
Um, I went to this bar, that--

1046
00:51:21,382 --> 00:51:23,428
Court will take a short recess.

1047
00:51:24,733 --> 00:51:25,734
Councils...

1048
00:51:26,779 --> 00:51:28,259
In my chambers, now.

1049
00:51:34,439 --> 00:51:35,614
What's going on now?

1050
00:51:37,398 --> 00:51:38,921
I'll find out. You stay here.

1051
00:51:41,837 --> 00:51:44,013
[unintelligible chatter]

1052
00:51:44,144 --> 00:51:47,234
-What the hell is going on here?
-I just received
the missing surveillance tape.

1053
00:51:47,365 --> 00:51:49,584
Lieutenant Joe Cook, Tampa PD.
How do you do, sir?

1054
00:51:49,715 --> 00:51:51,064
-[judge] Play it, bailiff.
-[Marty] Sorry.

1055
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,156
[beep]

1056
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:58,376
[tense music]

1057
00:52:18,396 --> 00:52:19,701
No way in hell that's going in.

1058
00:52:19,832 --> 00:52:21,616
Your Honor,
it's unusual. Maybe if--

1059
00:52:21,747 --> 00:52:24,053
[cross-talking]

1060
00:52:24,184 --> 00:52:26,360
We're up in 60 seconds.
Make a decision.

1061
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:28,493
A human life is at stake
here for Christ's sake!

1062
00:52:28,623 --> 00:52:30,495
Oh yes! Did you take a good
look on what that human life did

1063
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:32,410
-to Dolly Hamilton?
-What the hell
that's supposed to prove?

1064
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:35,195
-What's that prove?
-Shut the fuck up!
We got 49 seconds.

1065
00:52:35,326 --> 00:52:36,849
-What's your decision?
-I'm admitting it.

1066
00:52:36,979 --> 00:52:39,156
-Let's go.
-You did the right thing, judge.

1067
00:52:41,767 --> 00:52:45,074
Well, obviously something very
important just happened then.

1068
00:52:45,205 --> 00:52:47,512
That commercial break
was totally unexpected.

1069
00:52:47,642 --> 00:52:50,123
-Jeff, have you heard
anything with the booth?
-No, Tony. I haven't.

1070
00:52:50,254 --> 00:52:52,386
Wait, we're--
we're going back. It seems--

1071
00:52:52,517 --> 00:52:54,519
It seems it seems Judge Halvern
wants to make a statement.

1072
00:52:54,649 --> 00:52:55,824
All right.
Let's go back to the trial.

1073
00:52:56,999 --> 00:52:59,524
I have some important
instructions for the jury.

1074
00:53:01,439 --> 00:53:03,876
The court has
received new evidence.

1075
00:53:05,399 --> 00:53:08,228
A video tape quite
graphic in nature,

1076
00:53:08,359 --> 00:53:10,187
which has not been verified.

1077
00:53:10,317 --> 00:53:11,492
However...

1078
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,843
...according to the rules
of <i>Citizen Verdict,</i>

1079
00:53:14,974 --> 00:53:17,846
I have the discretion
to admit such a tape.

1080
00:53:18,325 --> 00:53:22,460
I have reviewed the tape myself,
and deemed it important enough

1081
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:24,984
to admit it.
A word of warning:

1082
00:53:27,116 --> 00:53:29,075
This tape is very graphic

1083
00:53:29,815 --> 00:53:33,732
and totally unsuitable
for children to watch.

1084
00:53:33,862 --> 00:53:35,516
Oh, that's it.
The kids are going to the house.

1085
00:53:35,995 --> 00:53:37,388
Aah!

1086
00:53:37,518 --> 00:53:39,955
Your Honor, I put
the strongest objection

1087
00:53:40,086 --> 00:53:42,567
to your ruling
on the official record now.

1088
00:53:42,697 --> 00:53:43,568
Noted.

1089
00:53:45,483 --> 00:53:46,397
Ms. Landers.

1090
00:53:49,138 --> 00:53:50,009
Clerk.

1091
00:53:50,662 --> 00:53:52,054
Play the tape.

1092
00:53:58,496 --> 00:54:00,585
[tense music]

1093
00:54:11,726 --> 00:54:13,815
[tense music continues]

1094
00:54:54,595 --> 00:54:55,466
Fuck that!

1095
00:54:56,075 --> 00:54:58,207
-It fucking proves nothing!
-[judge] Out. Out.

1096
00:54:58,338 --> 00:54:59,513
-Out!
-Fuck it!

1097
00:54:59,992 --> 00:55:02,647
-Your fucking asshole. Fuck you!
-You get out.

1098
00:55:02,777 --> 00:55:04,866
-Who do you think you are?
-[judge] You cannot--

1099
00:55:04,997 --> 00:55:06,694
Get out!
Out! Out! Out!

1100
00:55:06,825 --> 00:55:08,522
Fuck you. Fucking...

1101
00:55:08,653 --> 00:55:10,524
Suck this. All right.

1102
00:55:11,133 --> 00:55:13,222
You're my lawyer, man.
Fucking help me.

1103
00:55:14,876 --> 00:55:16,443
Fucking help me!

1104
00:55:17,488 --> 00:55:18,489
Oh, my gosh.

1105
00:55:19,141 --> 00:55:20,229
That was horrible.

1106
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:23,537
Yes.

1107
00:55:23,668 --> 00:55:25,626
Words. I, I don't have words.

1108
00:55:36,985 --> 00:55:39,118
Wait, it seems we're,
we're going back. Yes.

1109
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:41,250
Yes. We're going back.

1110
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:43,296
Ladies and gentlemen...

1111
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:47,735
...Ricky Carr killed
Dolly Hamilton.

1112
00:55:47,866 --> 00:55:50,825
We've presented you
with all the forensic evidence.

1113
00:55:50,956 --> 00:55:54,046
But now you've seen
the truth with your own eyes.

1114
00:55:55,787 --> 00:56:00,748
Ricky Carr viciously attacked

1115
00:56:00,879 --> 00:56:03,272
and raped Dolly Hamilton.

1116
00:56:04,273 --> 00:56:06,145
And when he was through,
with no regard

1117
00:56:06,275 --> 00:56:08,452
for her life or her family...

1118
00:56:10,105 --> 00:56:11,803
...he slit her throat,

1119
00:56:11,933 --> 00:56:13,413
ripped off her necklace,

1120
00:56:13,935 --> 00:56:15,284
and walked away like an animal,

1121
00:56:15,415 --> 00:56:16,547
stealing her...

1122
00:56:17,286 --> 00:56:18,418
from her husband...

1123
00:56:19,419 --> 00:56:20,420
...her children...

1124
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:23,554
...and an America
that loved her.

1125
00:56:27,949 --> 00:56:29,647
It's that simple. [scoffs]

1126
00:56:31,213 --> 00:56:34,695
Ricky Carr is guilty as charged.

1127
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:36,741
Thank you.

1128
00:56:41,746 --> 00:56:43,487
[Sam]
Ladies and gentlemen,
I don't know where to begin.

1129
00:56:47,752 --> 00:56:49,057
I agreed to take part
in <i>Citizen Verdict</i>

1130
00:56:49,188 --> 00:56:50,755
cause I thought
it was a great concept.

1131
00:56:53,192 --> 00:56:54,062
Great concept.

1132
00:56:55,324 --> 00:56:56,369
It's a concept.

1133
00:57:00,025 --> 00:57:00,895
Your Honor...

1134
00:57:02,549 --> 00:57:03,420
If this tape...

1135
00:57:04,812 --> 00:57:06,292
...is even considered
as evidence...

1136
00:57:07,249 --> 00:57:09,687
and brought into this courtroom
at this juncture in time,

1137
00:57:09,817 --> 00:57:10,949
this is an atrocity.

1138
00:57:14,561 --> 00:57:15,780
This is a travesty.

1139
00:57:17,608 --> 00:57:18,435
Where this tape comes from?

1140
00:57:21,481 --> 00:57:22,351
Where it comes from?

1141
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:27,008
How bad do you
want an execution here?

1142
00:57:28,357 --> 00:57:30,925
How bad do we want an execution?

1143
00:57:32,231 --> 00:57:33,928
Because I'm seeing
three executions here.

1144
00:57:36,365 --> 00:57:38,890
We have just been witness
to the supposed video execution

1145
00:57:39,804 --> 00:57:40,979
of Dolly Hamilton.

1146
00:57:41,109 --> 00:57:42,502
We may yet bear
witness to the real

1147
00:57:42,633 --> 00:57:45,984
execution of my client here,
Ricky Dean Carr.

1148
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:48,726
But what we're
standing witness to now

1149
00:57:48,856 --> 00:57:51,424
is the execution
of a justice system,

1150
00:57:51,903 --> 00:57:53,339
that has been tried.

1151
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,254
It has been proven,
it has been tested.

1152
00:57:55,384 --> 00:57:57,604
It has existed in this nation

1153
00:57:57,735 --> 00:57:58,910
for 200 years.

1154
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,041
And this...

1155
00:58:01,347 --> 00:58:03,610
...this unequivocally eradicates

1156
00:58:03,741 --> 00:58:05,569
any notion
of a verdict of guilty

1157
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:07,266
'cause you leave us no choice

1158
00:58:08,136 --> 00:58:08,963
but to vote not guilty.

1159
00:58:10,922 --> 00:58:14,360
This man has not being pushed
off some, some, some island.

1160
00:58:17,058 --> 00:58:20,018
This man is not, not, not
being voted out of a dormitory.

1161
00:58:20,584 --> 00:58:23,630
This man is being
voted off the planet.

1162
00:58:26,851 --> 00:58:28,113
That's not justice.

1163
00:58:28,983 --> 00:58:29,810
That's just television.

1164
00:58:30,811 --> 00:58:31,725
That's your legacy.

1165
00:58:32,987 --> 00:58:33,814
How dare you?

1166
00:58:35,773 --> 00:58:36,600
How dare we?

1167
00:58:40,081 --> 00:58:40,952
We vote no.

1168
00:58:44,042 --> 00:58:44,869
We vote no.

1169
00:58:47,132 --> 00:58:48,133
We vote no.

1170
00:58:52,398 --> 00:58:53,268
Thank you.

1171
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,753
Ladies and gentlemen,
the jury, you now have one hour

1172
00:59:00,232 --> 00:59:01,712
to consider your verdict.

1173
00:59:02,495 --> 00:59:04,845
Well, Florida, you've
heard it loud and clear.

1174
00:59:04,976 --> 00:59:08,370
You now have one hour
to review the evidence
and highlights of this trial.

1175
00:59:09,067 --> 00:59:12,723
So log on to citizen verdict.com
or call our 1-800 number.

1176
00:59:12,853 --> 00:59:16,030
-[background chatter]
-[Tawny] Once you've made your
decision, place your vote.

1177
00:59:16,161 --> 00:59:20,165
[Jeff]
Now there will be a charge
of $2.99 to go to trial.

1178
00:59:20,295 --> 00:59:22,863
A portion of that amount will
go to benefit law enforcement

1179
00:59:22,994 --> 00:59:25,126
and crime prevention
here in Florida.

1180
00:59:25,866 --> 00:59:28,260

00:59:34,266 --> 00:59:36,050
...You are the jury.

1184
00:59:37,138 --> 00:59:40,011
[tense music]

1185
01:00:15,176 --> 01:00:17,396
Well, America,
the official numbers are in

1186
01:00:17,526 --> 01:00:19,833
from the accounting firm
of Cost Anderson.

1187
01:00:19,964 --> 01:00:21,966
Over nine million
people in Florida

1188
01:00:22,096 --> 01:00:23,663
have cast their vote tonight.

1189
01:00:23,794 --> 01:00:26,274
That's unbelievable.
Those numbers are way above

1190
01:00:26,405 --> 01:00:28,146
our most optimistic predictions.

1191
01:00:28,276 --> 01:00:29,713
[strikes the gavel]

1192
01:00:31,323 --> 01:00:33,020
Will the defendant kindly rise.

1193
01:00:45,206 --> 01:00:46,643
May I have the verdict.

1194
01:00:46,773 --> 01:00:48,645
It's nail biting time, Tawny.

1195
01:00:48,775 --> 01:00:50,429
It certainly is, Jeff.

1196
01:00:51,169 --> 01:00:53,301
[cheering]

1197
01:00:54,955 --> 01:00:56,609
[crowd chanting]
Guilty! Guilty!

1198
01:00:58,785 --> 01:01:00,874
[cheering and clapping]

1199
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:03,616
Whoo!

1200
01:01:10,318 --> 01:01:12,451
[tense music]

1201
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:15,236
[judge]
Ricky Carr...

1202
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:19,153
you've been found guilty
by a jury of your peers.

1203
01:01:20,372 --> 01:01:23,157
I hereby sentence you
to death by lethal injection.

1204
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:25,769
May God have mercy on your soul.

1205
01:01:27,074 --> 01:01:27,858
[strikes the gavel]

1206
01:01:27,988 --> 01:01:30,077
[melancholic music]

1207
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:40,566
[Tawny]
Thank you, America.

1208
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,220
It's been
a privilege bringing you

1209
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:44,352
the first live televised trial,

1210
01:01:44,483 --> 01:01:46,790
where you were the jury.

1211
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:50,707
Join us real soon for the next
edition of <i>Citizen Verdict.</i>

1212
01:01:50,837 --> 01:01:53,274
[reporters]
Governor! Governor! Governor!

1213
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:55,712
Good evening.

1214
01:01:55,842 --> 01:01:56,974
Good evening.

1215
01:01:58,584 --> 01:02:00,499
I'm going to be very,
very brief. [exhales]

1216
01:02:01,674 --> 01:02:05,199
This evening, the people of
Florida have had an opportunity

1217
01:02:05,896 --> 01:02:08,246
to participate
in our new legal system.

1218
01:02:09,682 --> 01:02:11,771
Nine million Floridians voted.

1219
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:15,732
And a just verdict was reached.

1220
01:02:17,211 --> 01:02:20,301
-Thank you very much.
-[reporters] Governor!
Governor! Governor!

1221
01:02:21,172 --> 01:02:25,263
I was very much in favor of the,
the guilty verdict and...

1222
01:02:26,307 --> 01:02:29,484
And I do support the,
the death penalty.

1223
01:02:29,615 --> 01:02:31,312
I thought the prosecuting
attorney a little tight

1224
01:02:31,443 --> 01:02:33,314
in the drawers,
but that's their job.

1225
01:02:33,445 --> 01:02:34,489
You know? So...

1226
01:02:35,273 --> 01:02:36,143
Law school.

1227
01:02:36,622 --> 01:02:38,102
After seeing that video,

1228
01:02:38,232 --> 01:02:39,756
-there's no question in my mind.
-[woman exhales]

1229
01:02:39,886 --> 01:02:41,714
The tape just
popped up basically.

1230
01:02:42,802 --> 01:02:45,892
I'm looking at the guy as far
as innocent at that point.

1231
01:02:46,632 --> 01:02:48,677
But after looking at the,

1232
01:02:48,808 --> 01:02:50,854
the video cams,

1233
01:02:50,984 --> 01:02:53,987
I don't know, it's pretty, it's,
I get mixed feelings there.

1234
01:02:54,118 --> 01:02:56,903
[in foreign accent]
And you know what I liked
also about the show?

1235
01:02:57,512 --> 01:02:59,340
The spirit of America.

1236
01:02:59,471 --> 01:03:04,693
All the flag and the,
the eagle on the ground.

1237
01:03:04,824 --> 01:03:06,521
-Mm-hmm.
-That's I like it.

1238
01:03:07,435 --> 01:03:10,351
People are voting
just kinda for kicks.

1239
01:03:10,961 --> 01:03:12,963
You know, they may not
really be thinking about it

1240
01:03:13,093 --> 01:03:16,314
as deeply as if you're
one of 12 people

1241
01:03:16,444 --> 01:03:19,317
and you know that your vote
really will count.

1242
01:03:20,361 --> 01:03:23,016
I think when it gets to be so
many, it's more of a game.

1243
01:03:23,147 --> 01:03:25,932
Sam Patterson
was duped from day one.

1244
01:03:26,063 --> 01:03:27,673
Uh, I, I thought that, the,

1245
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,502
uh, you know based on what I saw
with the evidence coming in

1246
01:03:30,632 --> 01:03:32,939
as it did, this evidence
that was introduced

1247
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:35,289
on the day of trial,
which is absurd.

1248
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:40,077
Uh, you know, [stutters]
that represents the worst

1249
01:03:40,207 --> 01:03:44,559
in [stutters] in affording
the defendant due process.

1250
01:03:45,256 --> 01:03:48,563
Uh, I'm,
I'm horribly disappointed
in what I saw tonight.

1251
01:03:48,694 --> 01:03:51,175
And if this gains momentum,

1252
01:03:52,002 --> 01:03:55,135
uh, then I think, uh,

1253
01:03:55,744 --> 01:03:57,398
uh, we're in trouble.

Rockman told me

1267
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,549
that if I did the show

1268
01:06:29,115 --> 01:06:30,421
he would help me,

1269
01:06:30,551 --> 01:06:32,205
he would give me a story.

1270
01:06:32,336 --> 01:06:34,077
Had a chance to get off.

1271
01:06:35,252 --> 01:06:37,210
But he told me not
to tell you anything,

1272
01:06:38,124 --> 01:06:40,997
that if I did,
I was guaranteed to die.

Yep.

Let's go.

1300

[Tawny]
Thank you for your generosity,
Florida.

1301
01:08:20,444 --> 01:08:23,360
We have had an unbelievable
amount of calls.

1302
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:25,188
[Jeff]
That's right, Tawny.
The number of people

1303
01:08:25,318 --> 01:08:27,103
who have called in
to witness this event?

1304
01:08:27,233 --> 01:08:28,321
Twelve million.

1305
01:08:29,496 --> 01:08:33,021
[Tawny]
Well, America, we'll see you
this evening at nine eastern.

1306
01:08:33,152 --> 01:08:35,285
The execution of Ricky Carr.

1307
01:08:46,861 --> 01:08:48,036
How are you?

1308
01:08:48,167 --> 01:08:49,690
I'm good, real good.

1309
01:09:04,096 --> 01:09:04,966
[Marty]
Hey, Sam.

1310
01:09:07,621 --> 01:09:08,622
Hell of a view.

1311
01:09:12,365 --> 01:09:13,671
[Sam]
This is why I was
summoned here?

1312
01:09:15,847 --> 01:09:17,327
Oh, Sam's angry.

1313
01:09:19,633 --> 01:09:20,678
What's your problem, Sam?

1314
01:09:21,635 --> 01:09:22,854
The killer is gonna die.

1315
01:09:27,772 --> 01:09:28,903
You are one sick man.

1316
01:09:29,861 --> 01:09:31,645
-I'm a sick man?
-Yeah. You're a sick, man.

1317
01:09:31,776 --> 01:09:34,082
No, no. You defended a sick man,

1318
01:09:34,213 --> 01:09:37,390
and we gave the people
exactly what they wanted.

1319
01:09:37,521 --> 01:09:40,393
Yeah, I adjusted it up a little
bit, made a little bit show biz.

1320
01:09:40,524 --> 01:09:43,004
But the fact is a killer dies,

1321
01:09:43,135 --> 01:09:46,182
and we make a ton
of money. Grow up.

1322
01:09:56,757 --> 01:09:57,628
You're a barker.

1323
01:10:01,022 --> 01:10:02,285
You're a barker at the circus.

1324
01:10:04,374 --> 01:10:06,202
[scoffs]
Take care of yourself.

1325
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:14,210
[waves breaking]

1326
01:11:13,443 --> 01:11:14,531
Televised?

1327
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:16,010
Nah.

1328
01:11:16,707 --> 01:11:18,970
Nah, I don't think
it should be televised now.

1329
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:21,015
[inhales] Um, I don't know.

1330
01:11:21,146 --> 01:11:23,627
If you pay for sex,

1331
01:11:23,757 --> 01:11:25,629
why don't you pay
to watch somebody get killed.

1332
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:27,848
They're guilty. Get rid of them.

1333
01:11:28,371 --> 01:11:30,547
Don't let them sit on death row.
Waste my money.

1334
01:11:30,677 --> 01:11:32,984
In Saudi Arabia?
Yes we have done the sentence

1335
01:11:33,114 --> 01:11:34,594
that they
cut their head by a sword.

1336
01:11:34,725 --> 01:11:35,856
I am not spe--

1337
01:11:36,596 --> 01:11:39,425
specifically in favor
of the death penalty myself.

1338
01:11:39,556 --> 01:11:43,168
Uh, I do have a,
a belief that the only person

1339
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,431
that is, uh, should [stutters]

1340
01:11:45,562 --> 01:11:47,172
allowed to take a life is God.

1341
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,522
I try to put myself
in someone else's place,

1342
01:11:49,653 --> 01:11:52,438
and if a loved one of mine
was murdered by someone

1343
01:11:53,004 --> 01:11:55,311
I would wanna
see that person pay.

1344
01:11:55,789 --> 01:11:57,356
It's got to happen.

1345
01:11:57,487 --> 01:11:58,357
We need it.

1346
01:11:59,184 --> 01:12:01,621
I think we need it very much

1347
01:12:01,752 --> 01:12:04,276
and I'm in love with
the death penalty because...

1348
01:12:05,146 --> 01:12:07,540
...you know, that put a lot of
fear in a lot of people's heart

1349
01:12:07,671 --> 01:12:09,325
by having that death penalty.

1350
01:12:09,455 --> 01:12:11,152
Uh, it's clear
that the crime rates

1351
01:12:11,283 --> 01:12:13,938
have not been affected,
in the least,

1352
01:12:14,068 --> 01:12:15,722
by, violent crime rate,

1353
01:12:15,853 --> 01:12:18,464
by the number of executions
that they have somewhere,

1354
01:12:18,595 --> 01:12:21,119
that, that they provide
some sort of deterrence.

1355
01:12:21,249 --> 01:12:22,816
They do not provide a deterrent.

1356
01:12:22,947 --> 01:12:24,992
That's a... clear system.

1357
01:12:25,515 --> 01:12:27,778
That's pretty brutal, man.
[chuckles] You know?

1358
01:12:27,908 --> 01:12:29,345
See somebody die on television.

1359
01:12:29,475 --> 01:12:30,911
Nobody don't wanna
die on television

1360
01:12:31,042 --> 01:12:32,913
and see all these
people, you know?

1361
01:12:33,044 --> 01:12:35,481
All these people on TV, man,
watching somebody die.

1362
01:12:36,264 --> 01:12:38,441
[Citizen Verdict theme music]

1363
01:12:48,625 --> 01:12:50,235
This afternoon Ricky Carr

1364
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,324
was moved
from his death row cell

1365
01:12:52,455 --> 01:12:54,195
to the execution
observation area.

1366
01:12:54,326 --> 01:12:56,981
The prisoner is kept
in the observation area, so

1367
01:12:57,111 --> 01:12:59,679
that he may be watched
carefully during his last hours,

1368
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:02,334
in order to prevent
any attempt at suicide.

1369
01:13:02,465 --> 01:13:03,944
The execution observation area

1370
01:13:04,075 --> 01:13:05,772
is where he will
have his last meal

1371
01:13:05,903 --> 01:13:08,645
before being moved and prepped
for his execution.

1372
01:13:08,775 --> 01:13:11,474
And of course you'll be able
to watch all of his movements

1373
01:13:11,604 --> 01:13:15,521
thanks to our carefully placed
cameras in the execution area.

1374
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,089

[melancholic music]

1376
01:13:43,331 --> 01:13:47,640
Yes, Florida. Tonight
you will see a live execution

1377
01:13:47,771 --> 01:13:51,427
for the first time ever
in the history of television.

1378
01:13:51,557 --> 01:13:54,821
That's right Tawney. Exactly
nine p.m. Eastern Standard time

1379
01:13:54,952 --> 01:13:58,216
Ricky Carr will be
executed by lethal injection.

1380
01:13:58,695 --> 01:14:01,437
Last night Ricky Carr
was served his last meal.

1381
01:14:01,959 --> 01:14:04,396
We were told he chose steak
and chocolate cake.

1382
01:14:04,918 --> 01:14:06,790
Ricky also had a visit
from his parish priest

1383
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:09,445
where they reflected on some
scripture from <i>The Bible.</i>

1384

is bringing you

Everybody's got a price.

1561
01:28:23,254 --> 01:28:24,124
Me too.

1562
01:28:29,129 --> 01:28:30,000
It's all on tape.

1563
01:28:32,916 --> 01:28:34,004
[door opens]

1564
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:37,094
[sighs]

1565
01:28:39,966 --> 01:28:42,055
[clicks tongue] Marty... [sighs]

1566
01:28:43,187 --> 01:28:45,450
I told you right from the start.

1567
01:28:45,581 --> 01:28:47,147
You gotta do this thing right.

1568
01:28:49,062 --> 01:28:50,194
You didn't do it right.

1569
01:28:53,763 --> 01:28:54,851
Get him out of here.

1570
01:28:55,721 --> 01:28:56,679
What?

1571
01:28:57,157 --> 01:28:58,724
What are you doing? Hey!

1572
01:28:59,464 --> 01:29:01,814
Bullshit, get the fuck off me.

1573
01:29:01,945 --> 01:29:03,381
I'm Marty Rockman.

1574
01:29:03,947 --> 01:29:06,123
Get off me! Get-- get--

1575
01:29:06,253 --> 01:29:09,605
This is my temple. My church!

1576
01:29:09,735 --> 01:29:11,607
Sam, you're a fucker!

1577
01:29:11,737 --> 01:29:14,305
[cross-talking]

1578
01:29:16,873 --> 01:29:20,572
And so today Marty Rockman was
indicted on several charges

1579
01:29:20,703 --> 01:29:23,183
of bribery and obstruction
of justice.

1580
01:29:23,314 --> 01:29:25,664
Ironically, he was brought here

1581
01:29:25,795 --> 01:29:29,189
[cross-talking]

1582
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:31,322
...following his trial
on <i>Citizen Verdict.</i>

1583
01:29:31,453 --> 01:29:33,933
It's just another blow
for Rockman

1584
01:29:34,064 --> 01:29:36,414
whose staggering fall
from the limelight

1585
01:29:36,545 --> 01:29:38,460
began with the announcement
from Governor Tyler

1586
01:29:38,590 --> 01:29:40,200
that brought the show
to its end.

1587
01:29:40,810 --> 01:29:43,160
This is Carol Burke for FSN.

1588
01:29:43,726 --> 01:29:47,686
As a practitioner, I think
that the system works... uh...

1589
01:29:48,905 --> 01:29:51,777
I think that...
from time to time

1590
01:29:51,908 --> 01:29:55,172
you get judges
and prosecutors,

1591
01:29:55,912 --> 01:29:58,044
who perhaps are...

1592
01:29:58,175 --> 01:30:01,004
Prosecutors are,
who or overzealous

1593
01:30:01,134 --> 01:30:05,138
and judges
who may be a little lax in
interpreting the Constitution.

1594
01:30:05,269 --> 01:30:07,271
Uh... Uh...

1595
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:10,970
But, all in all, based on
what I see in my everyday work,

1596
01:30:11,797 --> 01:30:13,451
I believe the system works.

1597
01:30:14,713 --> 01:30:16,498
You don't take a soap company,

1598
01:30:16,628 --> 01:30:17,586
to create a soap opera.

1599
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:22,068
But the people
who wrote the Constitution

1600
01:30:22,199 --> 01:30:23,766
of the United States

1601
01:30:24,549 --> 01:30:25,681
fled persecution.

1602
01:30:25,811 --> 01:30:26,769
It wasn't a soap opera.

1603
01:30:28,771 --> 01:30:31,817
They were fighting for their
fundamental belief systems,

1604
01:30:31,948 --> 01:30:34,211
their fundamental
belief systems.

1605
01:30:35,908 --> 01:30:37,388
Justice is not a commodity.

1606
01:30:38,911 --> 01:30:40,043
It can't be negotiated.

1607
01:30:40,826 --> 01:30:42,306
It can't be merchandised.

1608
01:30:43,916 --> 01:30:47,137
And you to
stand here right now
and allow this appetite of ours

1609
01:30:47,267 --> 01:30:49,618
for new technologies,
for ratings, for numbers.

1610
01:30:50,488 --> 01:30:52,925
We allow
that appetite to consume

1611
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:54,579
our fundamental
belief systems...

1612
01:30:56,015 --> 01:30:57,626
...our individual liberties...

1613
01:30:58,278 --> 01:30:59,366
...our freedoms.

1614
01:31:01,238 --> 01:31:03,153
And you know what?

1615
01:31:04,023 --> 01:31:06,461
I'd rather you all go out
right now become missionaries.

1616
01:31:07,636 --> 01:31:09,855
I mean it. Become missionaries.

1617
01:31:09,986 --> 01:31:11,770
Because I want you to believe.

1618
01:31:12,902 --> 01:31:14,294
I want you to believe.

1619
01:31:15,078 --> 01:31:16,688
I want you to believe
in this Constitution.

1620
01:31:16,819 --> 01:31:18,560
I want you to believe
in this democracy.

1621
01:31:18,690 --> 01:31:20,823
I want you to believe
in yourselves.

1622
01:31:20,953 --> 01:31:22,564
Believe in yourselves.

1623
01:31:25,567 --> 01:31:26,437
People, today...

1624
01:31:27,786 --> 01:31:29,005
...you're about
to take an oath.

1625
01:31:32,095 --> 01:31:33,313
An oath is something sacred.

1626
01:31:34,706 --> 01:31:36,316
If you'd all just
oblige me now to stand.

1627
01:31:42,192 --> 01:31:43,715
I do solemnly swear.

1628
01:31:43,846 --> 01:31:45,674
[students]
I do solemnly swear.

1629
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:48,677
To support the Constitution
of the United States of America.

1630
01:31:48,807 --> 01:31:52,724
That I'll support
the Constitution
of the United States of America.

1631
01:31:53,290 --> 01:31:55,597
And to support the Constitution
of the state of Florida.

1632
01:31:55,727 --> 01:31:58,077
And the Constitution
of the state of Florida.

1633
01:31:58,208 --> 01:32:01,124
[Sam]
That I'll maintain the respect
to the courts of justice.

1634
01:32:01,254 --> 01:32:03,953
That I'll maintain the respect
to the courts of justice.

1635
01:32:04,083 --> 01:32:05,258
[Sam]
And judicial offices.

1636
01:32:05,389 --> 01:32:06,608
[students]
And judicial offices.

1637
01:32:07,783 --> 01:32:08,914
So help me God.

1638
01:32:09,045 --> 01:32:10,133
[students]
So help me God.

1639
01:32:10,263 --> 01:32:12,396
